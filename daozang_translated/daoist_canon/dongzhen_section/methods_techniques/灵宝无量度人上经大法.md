**The Eight Illuminations Unfolding Wisdom**

The Mystic Master said: The Great Method of the Numinous Treasure was expounded by the Most High Great Lofty Primordial Heavenly Worthy, received by the Jade Clarity Dao Lord, the Five Venerable Thearchs, the Exalted Perfected Saints, the Wondrously Practiced Realized Ones, and the Divine Kings of the Ten Directions—all the supremely true and numinous deities. The Later Sage, the Mysterious Origin Golden Portal Lofty Perfected Heavenly Emperor, transmitted and disseminated its teachings below, so that the world might hear them. It is the thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures, comprising eighteen thousand scrolls. The root of all Daoist teachings, its profound and recondite mysteries pervade the myriad methods as one.

First, it clarifies the primordial qi of the Originator: from whence did the Jade Scripts first emerge? According to the *Numinous Treasure Jade Scripts’ Inner Sound Scripture*: Before the Three Qi, after the primordial darkness, within it the true essence suddenly transformed, giving rise to the primordial qi. Within the primordial qi there was a spirit, called the Primordial Heavenly King. Its qi congealed and coalesced, co-emerging with the Originator, flowing and transforming to crystallize into fragrance. Neither form nor appearance, now expanding, now contracting. When the kalpa of Extending Prosperity began, the one qi divided into two. From the spontaneous void arose the primordial qi. The two qi intertwined, congealing into the Great Void, pervading the boundless, each character a square foot in size, its eight corners radiating light—none could fathom its principle. The two qi congealed together, enfolding the Jade Scripts. When the kalpa of Dragon Han began, the Primordial Heavenly King apportioned the two qi, and the chaos parted to reveal light. The clear and lofty qi ascended to form heaven; the turbid and heavy qi descended to form earth. From the division and union of the two qi arose the harmonizing qi, called the Mysterious Qi, also known as the Great Brahmā’s Qi. When the kalpa of Vermilion Brightness began, the Originator unfolded the chart, within which the true yang qi transformed into the Cavernous Yang Fire. The Originator wielded the Cavernous Yang Fire to smelt and refine the Three Qi, blending them with the Jade Scripts to produce the Vermilion Script. Thus, the kalpa was named Vermilion Brightness, and the script was called the Vermilion Writ of the Jade Scripts—such is this principle.

Second, it clarifies the generation and nurturance of the chaos, the forging of the myriad patterns. Since the sundering of chaos, the Three Qi formed the script, refined by fire into the radiant qi of the Vermilion Writ. The essence of the yang light became the sun; the essence of the numinous light became the moon. The remaining light dispersed to form the myriad images, while the spirits of the Three Qi divided into the Three Clarities’ sages. Thereafter, all things emerged and were born—none but the Three Qi of the Mysterious Originator. When the kalpa of Opening Sovereignty began, the Three Origins were apportioned, giving rise to the myriad sages. When the kalpa of the Supreme Thearch began, the five kalpas unfolded in succession. The Five Phases took full form, generating the myriad perfected ones and immortals. Within the five kalpas, the essence of the Mysterious Center was produced, and within that essence, the spirit—all were called Supreme Thearchs, hence the kalpa was named the Supreme Thearch Kalpa. During the five kalpas, the upright qi of the Five Phases flowed and spread, taking form. Now gathering, now dispersing; now coiling, now unfurling; now expanding; now embodying clouds, mist, fire, and haze; now resembling stars, constellations, gold, and jade; now assuming the shapes of insects, fish, dragons, and birds—all emerged from the Vermilion Writ of the Jade Scripts. Their forms naturally divided, generating the texts of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements: the Dragon Embryo, the Stone Radiance, the countless charts and books, the three divisions and thousand-fold destinies. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign and the Grand Perfected Jade Consort inscribed these texts onto bamboo slips, compiling them into registers to rectify the root of generation and completion, to encompass the origin of the myriad images, to mold the mechanism of all beings, and to serve as the pivot for the emergence of immortals and perfected ones.

Third, it clarifies that the Great Method of the Numinous Treasure naturally generates charts and books, encompassing the myriad images as the pivot of the Three Powers—such is this principle.

Fourth, it clarifies that the Great Method is the ancestral teaching of the Three Caverns, giving birth to all sages. After the unfolding of the five kalpas, the scriptures of the Jade Clarity Cavern-Real, the Highest Clarity Cavern-Mysterious, and the Grand Clarity Cavern-Spiritual, along with the talismans of the Four Supplements, all emerged from the Vermilion Writ of the Jade Scripts, taking form through the qi of the Numinous Treasure. In ancient times, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy commanded the thirty-nine emperors of the Supreme Thearch and the Heavenly Emperors of the Nine Empyreans, each recording scriptures and invocations to compose the thirty-nine chapters of the Great Cavern. They illuminated the source of the five kalpas’ unfolding and expounded the method of harmonizing the Three Qi into one, which was entrusted to the Jade Clarity Dao Lord. Subsequently, across the various heavens, the thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures were expounded. Later, during the eras of the Three Sovereigns, the Later Sage, the Mysterious Origin Venerable Lord of the Golden Portal, descended to transform and teach. During the time of Shennong, he descended as Yu Mozi, tasted the hundred herbs, distinguished the five grains, and expounded the *Scripture of Longevity*. During the time of Fuxi, he descended as Yuan Huazi, rectified the eight directions, elucidated yin and yang, and expounded the *Numinous Treasure Primordial Yang Scripture*. During the time of Zhu Rong, he descended as Yu Huazi, cultivated the Three Bonds, ordered the Seven Governors, and expounded the *Numinous Treasure Five Stars’ Constant Harmony Scripture*. During the time of the Yellow Emperor, he descended as Guang Chengzi and expounded the *Numinous Treasure Daoist Precepts Scripture*. During the time of Shaohao, he manifested as Que Yingzi and expounded the *Numinous Treasure Primordial Treasury Scripture*.

During the time of Gaoxin, he was known as Yuanyangzi and expounded the *Scripture of Subtle Words*. During the time of Emperor Yao, he was known as Wuchengzi and expounded the *Scripture of Governance*. During the time of Emperor Shun, he was known as Yinshouzi and expounded the *Supreme Clarity Scripture* and the *Lingbao Red Writ*. During the time of Yu of Xia, he was known as Zhenningzi and expounded the *Scripture of Fivefold True Writ* and the *Scripture of the Dragon’s Ascent*. During the Zhou dynasty, he was known as Guoshuzi and expounded the *Lingbao Scripture of Red Essence*, the two chapters of the *Dao and Virtue*, and the *Lingbao Scripture of Eightfold Might for Subduing Demons*. During the reign of the First Emperor of Qin, he bestowed the *Scripture of the Forest of Ghosts* along with talismans for summoning and commanding ghosts and spirits. In the Han dynasty, he was known as Chisongzi and expounded the *Scripture of the Three Ones*. During the reign of Emperor Wen, he was known as Heshanggong and expounded the *Chapters on the Dao and Virtue*. The Queen Mother of the West, by the command of the Primordial Beginning, expounded the *Lingbao Thirty-Sixfold Venerable Scriptures*. During the reign of Emperor Wu, she descended to the human realm and bestowed upon him the teachings of the *Supreme Cavern of Perfection*, the *Cavern of Mystery*, and the *Cavern of Spirit*. By the first year of Yongshou during the reign of Emperor Huan, she descended once more to the human realm and expounded the *Orthodox Unity* and the *Great Clarity Cavern-Spirit Dao*. Thus were the Three Caverns completed, all arising from the great Dharma of Lingbao, giving birth to all the sages.

The fifth principle clarifies that the human body’s Dharma originates from the Primordial Beginning, who established the primordial chaos, from which the sacred embryo of the Dharma-body is born within the human form. When father and mother unite in essence, a single point of harmonious qi is contained; the two qi divide and split, first giving rise to the kidneys. The three qi then differentiate, giving birth to the spirit-palace, which is the heart. The four qi intermingle, forming the canopy of the body’s shape. The five qi radiate together like a five-petaled flower, completing the five viscera with qi, resembling the image of the three qi extending to the fifth kalpa. The two qi divide and ascend, giving rise to the mud-pill palace, while descending to the watery abyss of the mysterious valley. The three qi refine with fire, ascending to give birth to the sun and moon, like the two eyes, illuminating the entire body and becoming the myriad images. The principle of the human body is identical to this.

To manifest forms beyond the body, one must know the ancestral qi of Lingbao. The qi of Lingbao, when entering sand, becomes gold; when entering stone, becomes jade; in birds, gives rise to phoenixes; in beasts, gives rise to dark dragons; in plants and trees, gives rise to sacred mushrooms; and in the five grains, contains auspicious omens. When dispersed, it becomes gentle winds; when ascending, it becomes propitious clouds; when descending, it becomes sweet dew. Entering water, it gives rise to night-glowing pearls; dwelling in humans, it gives rise to sages and worthies. Compared to this ancestral qi, it is the essence of the Great Harmony and the Supreme One, the chief of all spirits. Since this great treasure exists as such, just as the human form is born, entering the vast Floating Black Soil in the central cinnabar valley, it completes nine revolutions, divides into five transformations, and forms the Dharma-body. This is the tenfold cycle of the Primordial Beginning, where dried bones are revived.

The sixth principle clarifies that before the formless ancestral qi of the Primordial Beginning, by analogy, it descends in substance to become qi, giving birth to the myriad treasures. What form does it take in the present world? Refining and ingesting this qi leads to true transcendence. The qi of Lingbao exists in all things, such as the dragon’s pearl, the tiger’s treasure, ox bezoar, and crow cinnabar. The flowing essence of jade-light elixir is also of this nature, being the qi of Lingbao. Heaven and earth correspond to the sun and moon. The time when the sun is at its zenith corresponds to the initial union of spirit and qi within the body. Thus, the Supreme One Perfected says: "Always at the Great Ultimate, grasp the pivot; in movement and stillness, the spirit-pearl descends behind the curtain. Since the Lingbao arises in the mysterious valley, even a grain of millet can be sung and chanted in empty space." Those who obtain and ingest this will surely ascend to the rank of Perfected. Therefore, lesser immortals cannot approach this resemblance.

The seventh principle clarifies that within the great Dharma, the Way of the Great Cavern nurtures beings and returns the spirit, enabling ascent in broad daylight. Next, reciting the *Scripture of Long Life, Deliverance from the World, Liberation Through Corpse-Transformation, and Attainment of the Dao* encompasses all methods within the scripture. This treasure scripture guides those lost in the heavens, elucidating the intent of the Primordial Beginning’s discourse—this is the constant principle. Above, it contains the Way of inner refinement, where bones and flesh ascend together; in the middle, the methods of long life, deliverance from the world, and liberation through corpse-transformation; below, the teachings of ascending to the ancestors and delivering the mysterious. In its greatness, it safeguards and stabilizes heaven and earth, rectifies the celestial lodges, and remedies disasters while repelling demons. In its smallness, it possesses the power to cure deep-seated illnesses and revive the dead. In its luminosity, it commands wind and thunder, transforming naturally with spiritual efficacy. In its subtlety, it summons and employs the myriad spirits, perceiving the texts of the ten heavens. Thus, it is said to encompass all methods.

The eighth principle clarifies that the great Dharma has three ranks, each leading to the attainment of sagehood, Perfection, and the immortal Dao. Those who thoroughly comprehend the mysterious and practice the ten superior Ways, with merits and virtues complete, ascend in broad daylight. For others who cultivate and recite, obtaining even one Dharma or one teaching, they achieve long life and deliverance from the world, becoming the foremost immortals of the earthly grotto-heavens. Those who morning and evening pay homage with reverence, serving and making offerings, will surely attain the immortality of corpse-transformation, becoming the scattered immortals of the Ten Continents and Three Islands.

Thus concludes the first scroll of the *Great Dharma of the Lingbao Scripture of Limitless Salvation*.

Preface to the *Great Dharma of the Lingbao Scripture of Limitless Salvation*

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign compiled this collection. From the Primordial Beginning of the Ancestral Kalpa, it is the root and origin of Heaven and Earth. The *Lingbao* revealed its diagrams, encompassing the pivot of yin and yang. It expounds the principles of the sun and moon’s transformations, governs the mechanisms of stellar transits and celestial movements. Subtly gathering the revolving net, it uplifts the cycles of *zi* and *wu*, comprehends the creative workings of the Five Phases, and pursues the primal origins of the Two Qi. Advancing and retreating with *qian* and *kun*, soaring and revolving with *li* and *kan*, it captures the dragon and tames the tiger, reins the phoenix and rides the simurgh. At dawn, it feasts on the essence of the Purple Palace; at dusk, it drinks the fluid of the Azure Flower. Refining the form with flowing fire, washing the substance in the Eastern Pool, six dragons dance in the layered skies, and the Nine Qi seethe and boil in the Jade Crucible.

Does the Dao give birth to me, yet things have no fixed form? Abandoning things to preserve form, then qi and spirit merge, and the true self becomes luminous. Releasing emotions to nurture vastness, then essence and blood flow freely, and qi naturally congeals. The true fire soars high, flying to support the radiant sun of Mount Fuyou. Water and metal are restrained, flourishing the toad of the Jade Pass. Eight simurghs sing in unison, praising the elegant melody of the empty song. Nine phoenixes chant together, extolling the mysterious sound of the Ten Absolutes. Looking up and down at the numinous mound, the Heavenly Perfected of the Ten Directions gather of themselves. Paying homage to the Most High, the feathered guards of the myriad spirits soar in chariots.

A grain of millet hangs high, its transformations unfathomable. When it contains and embraces the empty pearl, then the countless multitudes all return. When the turbid vie and rush forth, then the thousand qi and myriad Perfected scatter entirely. Gathering qi forms treasures; assembling spirit creates numinosity. *Qian* is pure yang in its vigor; *kun* is pure yin in its depth. The natural qi is formless and nameless. Above, it reaches the Nine Pures, where qi is provisionally named as a designation. Below, it penetrates the Nine Earths, where form is then named as a designation.

Thus, know that in the profound and obscure, the dim and indistinct, when stillness is absolute, response follows upon stimulus, and the Two Qi revolve—Heaven and Earth move in accord with the seasons. The Three Fields communicate with the wondrous; yin and yang revolve to bring about transformation. There is no need for external application; why labor to create for oneself? Preserving spirit and tapping the teeth awaken the gates of the Eight Paths of the Initial Perfected. Refining qi and inscribing talismans clarify the rules for scholars to uphold.

To ingest and swallow the Nine Cycles, one must align with the transformations of the Four Seasons. Circulating the *zhou-tian*, water and fire meet; smelting metal and casting the crucible, refining stone to mend the Mysterious. Stealing the essence of the sun and moon, conjoining the lead and mercury of the spirit and Perfected. First clarify *zi* and *wu*, then distinguish water and metal. Advancing and retreating, drawing and adding, know the seasons and recognize the signs. Warmth, regulation, nurturing, and refinement—without error in the alchemical process.

Do not kill or harm out of desire and greed; do not envy or covet through lust and theft. Distance yourself from hatred and aversion; transform alien bones into kin. Deliver and ferry Heaven and humanity, propagate the teachings in the mundane world. Fathom the profound and investigate the subtle, thoroughly illuminating the wisdom of the grottoes. Bind demons and dispel afflictions, severing the source of the Six Roots’ obstructions. Abandon the false to follow the true, extinguishing the path of the Five Sufferings’ endless cycle. Restrain the hun and control the po, nurturing qi and concealing spirit. The body radiates light, and the form leaves no trace. The Three Luminaries open and clarify; separation and union occur naturally.

Feasting high in the Fragrant Canopy, for ten thousand kalpas on the Cloud Terrace, donning the cap and ascending in flight to the Golden Gates and Jade Mountains, in the boundless realm of carefree wandering. Driving the jade chariot, the Ten Qi manifest flight in the heavens. Controlling the green carriage, the Five Elders of the various heavens incline their radiance. Swiftly eliminating the causes of karmic transgressions, eradicating the path of evil roots.

Wondrous indeed is this Dharma! Thus, it is ranked among the scriptures, awakening the lost and guiding the unenlightened. Formerly, I encountered the Venerable One of Pure Subtlety, who taught me the inhalation and exhalation of the Two Qi. Later, I met the Jade Emperor of the Mysterious Sovereign, who bestowed upon me the oral instructions of the Golden Elixir. Thereby, I understood the primordial numbers of Heaven and Earth, and grasped the mechanisms of yin and yang’s generation and destruction.

The hundred grasses and myriad flowers all guard their roots and secure their stems. Rare birds and strange beasts all embrace the One and contain the Primordial. Thus, know that inverting the Five Phases and overturning the Four Images, stealing the qi of the Primordial One and Flying Mystery, guarding the essence of the true and wondrous body. Establishing the precious crucible on Mount Kongtong, flying the golden essence in the numinous grotto. Meeting the inner and outer water and fire, uniting the upper and lower spatulas. The Primordial Qi circulates, resonating with the Yellow and Mysterious to make the Pearl of Mystery radiant. Encompassing the cosmos, containing the Golden Elixir, its resources are inexhaustible.

Thus, know that Heaven and Earth alone are revered, their transformations formless and without substance. The wondrous Dao of *qian* and *kun*, the beginningless and endless of life and death. The Dao is not sought afar; it does not leave the door and window. Those who draw near are few; those who distance themselves are many. Abandoning the root and forgetting the true, they willingly delight in perishing in the springs and soil. Entering the deviant and forsaking the correct, they vainly endure summer and winter.

Stillness generates strength; tranquility prompts profound reflection. The Seven Emotions stir and fan, yang is severed and yin arises, endangering life and destiny. The Six Desires entice and indulge, essence scatters and form departs, spirit and qi vanish. The Five Viscera shake and sway; the Nine Orifices close their gates. Without knowing the origin of life and destiny, how can one attain the marvelous union of counterparts? How can one understand creation and transformation, or discern the mysterious mechanism?

I invoke great compassion, wishing to uplift the immortals-to-be. Gathering this numinous qi, I compile it as the *Mysterious Chapters*, thus naming it the *Lingbao’s Fish-Trap and Rabbit-Snare*, corresponding to the inner Dharma of the true scriptures. Entrusting it to the wondrous practice, to emerge in the world and ferry beings, manifesting in the Ten Directions under various names and titles, compiling it into scriptures that fill the Ganges’ sands.

Every line is profound; every passage is the Dao. Awakening to this wondrous principle, one enters life and exits death, abiding with the Dao forever. Comprehending this true mechanism, separation and union occur naturally, and coming and going are unimpeded. Those who encounter it are not of ordinary bone; those who practice it are Perfected Immortals of accumulated kalpas. Those who err in the destinies of humanity and Heaven fear straying from the path of enlightenment. Designating names and fixing diagrams, they verify and awaken the Dharma gates. Practitioners conceal it in secrecy; those who realize the true may be delivered.

Respectfully composed.

**Scroll Two of the *Great Dharma of the Lingbao Scripture of Limitless Salvation*: The Five Translations Become the Book**

The Mysterious Master said: The Eight Clarities can open wisdom, yet the Five Translations first complete the world’s scriptures.

The First Translation: The Jade Characters arise before the Void, concealed within the empty and cavernous, named the Great Brahmā Jade Characters. When the Red Clarity revealed its diagrams, fire refined them into script, becoming the Red-Written Jade Characters.

The Primordial Beginning, through the mighty spiritual power of Great Permeation, unfolded the Five Scripts to give rise to divine spirits, expounding and weaving mysteries to complete the great Dharma.

The Second Translation: After the fire refined the script and the Red Writing emerged, each character measured a *zhang* in height, with eight corners radiating light. They covered the myriad heavens, casting their shade below upon the Western Primordium. As the root of the Nine Heavens and the force of flowing gold, their jade radiance and golden truth shone brilliantly across the Great Void. The Primordial Beginning commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to inscribe these characters, naming them the *Eight Might Dragon Script* or the *Script of the Eight Assemblies of the Myriad Heavens*. They were concealed within the Seven Jeweled Jasper Terrace of the Upper Clarity Mystic Capital Golden Palace, as well as the Eastern and Western Flower Halls of the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace’s Orchid Chamber Golden Chamber, the repository of the Nine Heavens’ Great Radiance.

The Third Translation: The Primordial Heavenly Worthy served as the patriarch of the Dao and its methods, while the Jade Emperor Dao Lord acted as the master of the Numinous Treasure teachings. They composed the *Five Chapters of Numinous Script True Writ*, forming the thirty-two heavens’ jade characters into scriptures, named the *Cloud Seal Luminous Chapters*. The Queen Mother of the West transmitted it to the Yellow Emperor, and the Dragon Might Venerable transmitted the *Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure* to Great Yu. The Most High and Later Sages also bestowed the *Venerable Scripture of the Numinous Treasure* upon the hundred generations of emperors, all contained within the thirty-six divisions of scriptures. There was yet another transmission involving the Yellow Emperor, who sought the Dao on Mount Emei and personally met the Sovereign, receiving the teachings anew. Later, during the Wu dynasty, the Left Immortal Weng transmitted it to the Supreme Pole’s Xu the Perfected, who disseminated it widely—this was not recounted again as a separate translation.

The Fourth Translation: On the seventh day of the seventh month in the first year of the *Yuanfeng* era of the Han, the Queen Mother of the West descended and bestowed this scripture upon Emperor Wu of Han. The emperor did not comprehend the language of the Great Brahmā. The Queen Mother said: "The Primordial Beginning is a being of the Great Canopy Heaven, and the Dao Lord is a person of the Western Na Jade Land. The languages of Heavenly Square and Divine Continent differ—how much more so the speech of the Great Brahmā?" Thereupon, she wrote it down with a brush, transcribing the Heavenly Script jade characters into contemporary writing. The language of the Great Brahmā—its dignified deportment, vestments, palace names, diagrams, titles, palace chambers, the *jiazi* cyclical signs, hexagrams, and *qi*, as well as the altar forms and great methods within—along with all categories of practices and the thirty-six divisions of venerable scriptures, were rendered into the language of the Han dynasty’s worldly writing, becoming the Dharma speech of antiquity and the present.

The Fifth Translation: The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign transcribed all the characters to establish the correct pronunciation. The Wondrous Practice Perfected composed talismanic writings for the great Dharma’s cultivation and application. The True Stabilizer Perfected, the Dark Radiance Perfected, and the Luminous Wondrous Perfected compiled the thirty-six divisions of true scriptures and talismanic diagrams into the *Central Alliance Precious Register*, forming the *Great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure* from the texts of the thirty-six divisions of true scriptures, thereby transmitting it widely. The Left Immortal Elder Weng transmitted the scriptures, registers, and methods to the Supreme Pole’s Xu the Perfected. The Elder bequeathed them to the Upper Clarity Perfected Yang, encompassing the scriptures and methods of the two ranks: the Jade Clarity Cavern Truth and the Upper Clarity Cavern Mystery. Later generations gradually developed divine writings—this was the Fifth Translation.

**Chapter on Fasting and Discipline**

The Mysterious Master said: All who receive and practice the *Great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure* must first receive the Ten Supreme Precepts:

1. Maintain an impartial mind; do not deceive yourself.
2. Be loyal to your lord and reverently filial to Heaven, Earth, and parents.
3. Extend kindness and benevolence to all beings; live frugally and restrain the self.
4. Be pure, upright, and honest; do not form cliques.
5. Honor the great Dharma and deeply believe in cultivation.
6. Respect ghosts and spirits; do not treat them lightly.
7. All clothing and food derive from the Primordial Beginning’s ancestral *qi*; do not entertain external thoughts.
8. Use ash-water to cleanse impurities; do not indulge in adornment.
9. Recite with the mouth and prostrate with the heart; do not exhaust the body.
10. On the seventh day, enter great stillness; the spirit’s light will become serene, and the Jade Clarity’s realm will appear.

The Mysterious Master said: All who study and recite this scripture, fathom the mysterious and investigate the subtle, practice the Dao to seek transcendence, must first receive and uphold the fasting Dharma and the Twelve Great Precepts:

1. Refrain from killing.
2. Refrain from harming.
3. Refrain from envy.
4. Refrain from jealousy.
5. Refrain from licentiousness.

7. Refrain from greed.
8. Refrain from desire.
9. Refrain from hatred.
10. Refrain from resentment.
11. Refrain from ornate speech.
12. Refrain from evil words.

The Mysterious Master said: To honor the supreme Dharma, deliver the dead and save the living, subdue hordes of demons, and command the hundred spirits, receive the Nine Wondrous Precepts of the True:

1. Be respectful and yielding; honor and nurture your parents.
2. Be diligent and loyal to your lord.
3. Do not kill; compassionately save all beings.
4. Do not be licentious; rectify the self and interact with things.
5. Do not steal; extend righteousness and diminish the self.
6. Do not be angry; do not bully others with ferocity.
7. Do not deceive; do not flatter, rob, or harm the good.
8. Do not be arrogant; do not disdain the utmost truth.
9. Do not be dual-minded; uphold the precepts with single-minded devotion.

The Mysterious Master said: All who receive these precepts must take refuge in the body, the spirit, and the life to the Three Supreme Treasures. Do not follow false teachers, nor be swayed by illusions, deceptions, or the demonic teachings of external paths, nor those who claim to be immortals or transcendents.

1. First, take refuge in the Supreme Dao Treasure.
2. Second, take refuge in the Supreme Scripture Treasure.
3. Third, take refuge in the Supreme Master Treasure.

The Mysterious Master said: All the above precepts were spoken by the Heavenly Worthy’s golden mouth. Those who receive and uphold them without violation will be celebrated by the myriad heavens, extinguish demonic trials, and attain transcendence. If one violates them, the Earth Bureau will swiftly report, the Three Officials will investigate, and the Five Emperors will record the transgression. Minor offenses will reduce one’s allotted lifespan; moderate offenses will subject the living soul to examination; grave offenses will calculate one’s merits and lead to downfall, stripping away longevity and emoluments, and demoting one’s rank among transcendents. If the violation was not intentional, repentance is still permitted. However, one must avoid the autumn equinox; repent and do not repeat the offense, for three failures will not be pardoned.

The Mysterious Master said: In practicing the fire Dharma, follow the auspicious days of the myriad heavens to purify and fast. Then, Heaven and Earth will inscribe your name, and the nine mysteries and seven ancestors will together ascend to the Southern Palace. Your person will be pure and auspicious, attaining long life without death. When merits are fulfilled and perfection achieved, blessings will extend to your family. All aspirations will be realized; ghosts and spirits will bow in reverence, and the ten thousand Perfected will come to pay homage.

On the first day of each month, the Jade Treasure August Heavenly Worthy of the East, together with the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, descends. On the eighth day, the Mysterious Perfected Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Blessings of the South, together with the Three Qi Heavenly Lords, descends. On the fourteenth day, the Supreme Marvelous Ultimate Heavenly Worthy of the West, together with the Seven Qi Heavenly Lords, descends. On the fifteenth day, the Mysterious August Jade Dawn Heavenly Worthy of the North, together with the Five Qi Heavenly Lords, descends. On the eighteenth day, the August Heavenly Worthy of Ascending Transcendence of the Northeast, together with the Brahma Qi Heavenly Lords, descends. On the twenty-third day, the Heavenly Worthy of Life-Preserving Salvation of the Southeast, together with the Brahma Qi Heavenly Lords, descends. On the twenty-seventh day, the Supreme Numinous Void August Heavenly Worthy of the Southwest, together with the Brahma Qi Heavenly Lords, descends. On the twenty-eighth day, the Boundless Supreme Florescence Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest, together with the Brahma Qi Heavenly Lords, descends. On the twenty-ninth day, the Jade Void Luminous August Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm, together with the Brahma Qi Heavenly Lords, descends. On the thirtieth day, the Perfected August Cavern Dawn Heavenly Worthy of the Lower Realm, together with the Ninefold Dark Earthly Sovereign, descends. In short months, the twenty-seventh day is omitted.

The Mysterious Master said: On these ten days of heavenly descent, it is fitting to purify, fast, repent of transgressions, and pray for grace, presenting petitions to the Ten Heavens. The Three Assemblies should likewise be observed. The first, the Assembly of Ascension, is held on the seventh day of the first month; the second, the Assembly of Celebrating Life, on the seventh day of the seventh month; and the third, the Grand Assembly of Establishing Life, on the fifth day of the tenth month.

The Mysterious Master said: These Three Assemblies, along with the Three Primes and the fifteenth days, are all times for universal salvation and merit assessment. There are also the Five La Days. On these days, as expounded in the *Sutra on the Profound Kindness of the True One’s Father and Mother*, it is proper to fast, venerate departed ancestors, recite scriptures, perform the Dao, and deliver the deceased—such a one is called a filial child. To sacrifice on other days is not only wanton worship but also fails to reach the departed, and the offering brings no blessing.

The La Days are as follows: the Heavenly La on the first day of the first month, the Earthly La on the fifth day of the fifth month, the Dao-Virtue La on the seventh day of the seventh month, the People’s Year La on the first day of the tenth month, and the Nobles’ La during the twelfth month.

The Mysterious Master said: There are also the Lesser Three Assemblies—on the gengshen day, the jiazi day, and one’s natal day. On the gengshen day, the Corpse Spirit reports one’s transgressions. On the jiazi day, the Great One reviews the registers of spirits. On one’s natal day, the hundred spirits pay homage to the body. On the Eight Nodal Days, the perfected of the eight directions gather to assess merit, demerit, and transgressions in the Eight Radiant Palace of the Upper Prime. These are the four beginnings, two solstices, and two equinoxes.

There are also the Lesser Nodal Assemblies, when it is fitting to perform jiao rites, make offerings, and recite scriptures to invite the descent of the Perfected and obtain blessings: the Heavenly Nodal Assembly on jiawu, the Earthly Nodal Assembly on jiashen, the Four Seasons Nodal Assembly on jiachen, the Human Nodal Assembly on jiazi, the Five Agents Nodal Assembly on jiaxu, the Heavenly Assembly on bingwu, the Earthly Assembly on renwu, the Day Assembly on gengwu, the Month Assembly on gengshen, the Stellar Assembly on xinyou, the Assembly of Transcendent Perfected on dingmao, the Dipper Assembly on the third day, and the Assembly of One’s Natal Day.

The Mysterious Master said: As one who studies the Way of transcendence and cultivates the great Dharma, whenever encountering any inauspicious assembly, one should also purify, fast, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When Heaven and Earth reach their end, when the stellar lodges deviate from their courses, when the sun and moon lose their brightness, when the four seasons fall out of order, when yin and yang are unbalanced, when the sovereign faces calamity, when warfare arises on all sides, when pestilence spreads, when the multitudes perish, or when teachers and friends pass away—these six conditions are precisely the essential occasions for the adept to perform meritorious deeds.

Moreover, when Heaven and Earth reach their end—whether the great or lesser cycles of the nine hundred and six yin and yang periods—there may be cataclysms of celestial and terrestrial rupture or the adversities of exhausted destiny. In such times, one must purify, fast, burn incense, and recite scriptures. Likewise, when the stellar lodges deviate from their paths, when their courses are violated, when baleful comets or ominous stars appear, or when the sun and moon are eclipsed or dimmed, one should also purify, fast, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the four seasons’ cold and warmth lose their proper measure, when yin and yang bring drought or flood, when untimely commands are issued, when perverse qi engenders calamity, when warfare arises in the nine regions, when rebellions erupt, when campaigns are waged east and west, or when traitors and rebels wield weapons everywhere, one should also purify, fast, burn incense, and recite scriptures.

Should the most sagely and divine persons, even if burdened by past karmic debts, encounter demonic trials, suffer misfortune, or endure adversity, they too should purify, fast, burn incense, and recite scriptures. As for those of shallow learning who fail to grasp the profound realm, how can they escape affliction? Moreover, in this defiled world of the five impurities, with its plagues of locusts, warfare, fire, pestilence, royal law, the Great One’s military destiny, or the collusion of evildoers to reclaim old debts, one should also purify, fast, burn incense, and recite scriptures. By performing such meritorious deeds, one will surely attain the rank of Perfected and become a minister of the Golden Towers.

The Mysterious Master said: The method for reciting scriptures is fully set forth in the *Chapter on Cultivation and Recitation*. The ritual for burning incense is found in the *Canon of Scriptural Weft*. There are four kinds of fasting: the fast of the heart, the constant fast, the pure and tranquil fast, and the perpetual fast.

The fast of the heart entails strictly observing the heavenly precepts, aligning heart and intent, harmonizing inner and outer conduct, freeing oneself from thought and desire, from anxiety and fear, sitting in effortless forgetfulness, embodying the virtue of the Perfected, and uniting with the standard of transcendence—this is called the fast of the heart. The constant fast entails abstaining from pungent flavors and impure foods, refraining from meat and desire. The pure and tranquil fast entails abstaining from the five grains, severing worldly affairs, dwelling in the mountains and forests, drinking primordial qi, upholding the precepts, forgetting worldly attachments, dissolving the bonds of the womb, and cutting off social ties. The perpetual fast entails practicing all three of the above methods for one or two months, one or two years, ten or twenty years—even to the point of ascending in flight, beginning with the first resolve.

According to the *Great Ultimate Code of the Statutes on Determining Transgressions from the Mysterious Capital*: Consuming the five pungent foods while reciting scriptures is the foremost transgression under the precepts. In reciting, cultivating, and chanting, to offend the numinous spirits or defile the true qi brings the retribution of the venomous serpent piercing the heart hell.

The consumption of the three *yan* foods forever extinguishes the hope of immortality. Furthermore, the flesh of the six livestock, as well as the fetuses and eggs of birds and beasts, must not be eaten. To consume them is to harm life and sever destiny. Pork and dog meat are especially forbidden—not only do they violate the precepts and break the fast, but even if one’s merits and virtues are complete, the gates of heaven will be barred, preventing entry, and one’s name will fail to reach the Upper Prime. Only when a Daoist falls ill may they consume dried venison, elk, goose, or duck meat. Once recovered, it is best to abstain again.

**Chapter on the Descent of the Treasured Scriptures**
The *Treasured Scriptures* were sealed and bestowed upon the world. The Heavenly Worthy, in the Azure Beginning Heaven, expounded this scripture and conferred it upon the Dao Lord. Later, in the Great Cinnabar Heaven, he granted the *Great Brahma Sound*, and after the Dao Lord completed its arrangement, it was revered as a treasure in the heavens and concealed within the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Jade Capital in the Mysterious Metropolis. Its sealing and safeguarding are of utmost gravity, transmitted only to the sagely. Later, the Queen Mother of the West petitioned the Heavenly Emperor to descend it for averting the calamity of the *Bao Jia Shen* year, entrusting it to those who cultivate the true. Thus, it remained in the human world.

This scripture comprises the hidden hymns of the myriad heavenly emperors and the secret incantations of the spirit-demons and kings. Within it are expounded the kalpas of heaven and earth, the names and titles of the ten thousand spirits, the intercourse of yin and yang, and the generation and transformation of primordial *qi*. Its meanings cannot be fully explicated; only those who attain enlightenment may naturally fathom them. In heaven, it is transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas; in the human realm, it is conferred once every forty years. To treat it lightly, to leak or profane it, brings misfortune upon nine generations and calamity to the dark yin—how could one not be cautious?

*—This chapter was annotated and determined by Li Shaowei.*

**Chapter on the Origin of the Inner Sound**
The Heavenly Worthy was seated in the Cypress Grove Lodge of the Vermilion Bright World when suddenly clouds and mist surged for three days and nights, plunging the world into unrelenting darkness. The Five Elderly Thearchs prostrated before the Heavenly Worthy and said: "Today, as we attend your seat, we have never witnessed such a phenomenon when the Heavenly Worthy expounds the teachings—mountains and seas fall silent, heaven and earth grow solemn and clear. Yet now, broad daylight is shrouded in gloom, and heaven and earth tremble in fear. We are perplexed and dare not presume the cause."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Today, the various heavens have manifested auspicious signs, and numinous responses arise spontaneously. The jade scriptures blaze with radiance, obscuring the light of heaven, compelling all present to await with closed eyes." In an instant, the celestial *qi* surged forth, the darkness dissipated, and five-colored light illumined the ten directions. In the midst of the void appeared sacred writings, each character a *zhang* in size, their resplendent patterns and eight-cornered rays dazzling the eyes, impossible to behold directly.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembled perfected beings: "These are the *Eight Assemblies of the Numinous Scriptures*, whose characters have no fixed form and whose purport is profound and abstruse. You would find them difficult to scrutinize." Thereupon, he commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign Person to transcribe the characters and elucidate their sounds, bestowing them upon the Supreme Dao Lord—a total of two hundred fifty-six characters. The Dao Lord arranged them into text, known as the *Great Brahma Hidden Language*, which he appended to the two subsequent chapters.

The Sovereign Person had once descended upon Mount Emei during the time of the Yellow Emperor, imparting to him the method of the *Three Ones and Five Sprouts*, before ascending once more to heaven.

*—This chapter was determined by combining the* Inner Sound Scripture *with the* Biographies of the Immortals.

**The Jade Chapters of Recitation and Visualization**

**Chapter on Reciting the Sacred Texts**
**Chapter on Visualization During Recitation**

The Mysterious Master said: For all who wish to recite and chant, follow the transformations of the divine.

Within a quiet chamber, visualize in the mind the names and forms of the thirty-two heavens in the four directions, where clouds and *qi* intertwine in profound obscurity. Amidst them stand palaces, towers, and halls, where the Heavenly Thearchs don their celestial robes and crowns, each detail distinct. Begin by visualizing the Supreme August Heaven, first knocking the teeth once and bowing in the heart. Proceed to the Great Bright Heaven, repeating this thirty-two times. When finished, close the eyes and silently contemplate the Three Fields emitting the dark, primordial, azure, yellow, and white *qi* of the Origin, like threads gradually rising from the body. The *qi* thickens, first entwining a single form, then enveloping the table and mat where one sits, until all is pervaded. It then swirls densely around the chamber before extending outward to encircle the space, eventually merging with heaven and earth in profound unity.

Next, visualize the Azure Dragon emerging from the liver to stand on the left, the White Tiger from the lungs to stand on the right, the Vermilion Bird from the heart to stand before, and the Dark Warrior from the kidneys to stand behind. A lion emerges from the spleen beneath the Cinnabar Field, twelve in total, arrayed to left and right. Imagine nine white cranes issuing from the Mud Pill Palace of the brain, encircling the four directions. Visualize the Palace of the Six Harmonies behind the brows, where sun and moon emerge from the two eyes, nine inches from the face, their light illuminating the chamber with radiant clarity.

Next, contemplate the light of the sun and moon congealing into a halo at the gate of the Great Vertebra, forming a nine-colored circular image like a rainbow, its brilliance shining in all ten directions—all must be vividly clear.

The secret incantations of the Origin comprise three kinds: the incantation of the heart, the subtle incantation, and the secret incantation. The incantation of the heart is a silent invocation held in the mind. The subtle incantation is spoken so softly that only the practitioner can hear. The secret incantation is uttered aloud, yet neither the practitioner nor others can discern its sound.

Ten recitations make one *guo*; ten *guo* make one *zhuan*. Recitation is done in a low voice, while chanting is a resonant intonation. After every ten words, swallow the saliva once; after every hundred words, click the teeth once. Swallowing saliva nourishes the *qi* and moistens the inner palaces; clicking the teeth gathers the perfected and harmonizes the spirits. Externally, this preserves the body from emptiness, preventing the exhaustion of the spirit by the corpse.

If a single character is mispronounced, repeat the preceding thirty characters. If a character is skipped, repeat the preceding fifty. After ten recitations, engage in visualization. Upon completing a full reading, one may eat and rest. In all daily activities and after meals, re-enter visualization as prescribed. Do not allow the mind to wander or mix with extraneous speech. The mouth must not profane the supreme Dao, the methods of the lofty sages and perfected beings. The heart must not fail to revere the Three Treasures, the texts of lord, teacher, and parents. The will must not disrespect the emerald jade, the resplendent and precious scriptures. The body must not neglect the incense and flame, the morning rites and prostrations.

If the mouth recites while the heart wanders, or the form visualizes while the will strays, merely producing sounds for others to hear or rushing through the text for speed, mispronouncing characters or carelessly reciting the divine scriptures—how can one hope to ascend in cloud chariots after ten thousand recitations, or avoid sinking into the Feng and Xian hells after countless repetitions? Such practitioners will only blame the Dao as empty words, unaware that their own conduct is at fault. One must receive transmission from a master and recite in accordance with celestial regulations. If after ten thousand recitations one has not ascended to the Great Void, the fault lies with the practitioner, who will incur severe divine censure and forfeit the rank of immortal and perfected. Those who receive and recite these texts must strive diligently, avoiding the sins of careless recitation and reckless disclosure. To commit such offenses is to lack the Dao’s compassion; heaven’s laws are clear, and the spirits will not show partiality.

**Detailed Procedures for Recitation, Chanting, and Visualization**

On days when scriptures are recited and practices observed, first sweep and purify the chamber, fast to cleanse body and mind, then enter the room. Sit facing east, burn incense, and knock the teeth ten times without letting the ears hear. Silently recite the *Purification of the Mouth Incantation*:

*"Cinnabar Mouth Spirit, expel filth and dispel miasma.
Tongue Spirit of Upright Order, connect life and nourish the spirit.
Spirit of the Thousand Teeth, repel evil and guard the perfected.
Throat Spirit, Mighty Tiger, guide the* qi *and draw the fluids.
Heart Spirit, Cinnabar Origin, enable me to commune with the perfected.
Contemplate the spirit, refine the fluids, and let the upright* qi *abide forever."*

Then close the eyes and silently visualize the Azure Dragon of the east, exhaling rain that mingles with the white *qi* of moonlight and the water of the kidneys, as if bathing in a great sea to wash away the impurities of the five viscera. After a long while, visualize the True Fire of the south descending, uniting with the red *qi* of solar essence and the fire of the heart to burn the body and the Dao chamber into ashes, leaving no trace of smoke or filth. Then perceive a great wind blowing away all dust and grime. Next, visualize the infant within the Cinnabar Field stepping through the Dipper and ascending the altar.

Silently recite the *Purification of Heaven and Earth Incantation*:

*"Within the cavernous void, resplendent is the Great Origin.
The mighty spirits of the eight directions enable me to be natural.
The talismanic commands of the Numinous Treasure proclaim to the nine heavens.
Qianluo Danna, the cavernous stem of the Great Mystery.
Slay demons, bind evil, and destroy ten thousand ghosts.
The Central Mountain’s divine incantation, the Jade Text of the Origin.
Recite once to repel ghosts and prolong life.
Traverse the Five Peaks, let the eight seas hear.
The Demon Kings bow their heads, attending my chariot.
Banish all defilement, let the Dao’s* qi *abide forever."*

Gently inhale the true *qi* of the four directions and lightly blow it over the body, beginning with the east. Silently bow to the ten directions, facing east, and visualize the infant within the Cinnabar Field.

Silently recite the *Mystic Essence of Opening the Scripture Incantation*:

*"Silent, it reaches the ultimate source;
Vast, it stands through kalpas immeasurable.
Profound and boundless, the cavernous script—
Who can fathom its depths?
Entering the path of the Great Vehicle,
Who counts the kalpas passed?
Neither born nor destroyed,
Yet born through the lotus.
Transcending the three realms’ bonds,
With compassionate heart, one unravels the world’s snares.
The perfected of unsurpassed virtue
Become immortals generation after generation."*

Then begin reciting from the head to *"ascend to the Upper Clarity."* Next, close the eyes and silently contemplate the thirty-two heavens, starting from the north with the Supreme August Yellow Brilliance Heaven, proceeding east and south to the four directions, each with eight heavens, situated within the azure firmament and amid purple clouds, in palaces of gold and jade. Visualize the east on the seam above the left ear, the west on the seam above the right ear, the south before the forehead, and the north behind the brain. Within each heaven, see the celestial palaces and towers, where the Thearchs sit solemnly, attended by hosts of guards. From below, the *qi* of each heaven pours down like the radiance of jade mist, entering one’s body.

For each heaven reached, first silently knock the teeth once in unison, then direct the spirit-mind upward to present oneself before the Thearch of that heaven. Upon completion, bow in the heart once. When the thirty-two heavens have been fully traversed, next visualize the Upper Cinnabar Field at the Hall of Impression emitting azure *qi*, the Middle Cinnabar Field at the heart emitting white *qi*, and the Lower Cinnabar Field below the navel emitting yellow *qi*. These mingle with the descending *qi* of the external directions—azure from the east, white from the west, and crimson from the south—each flowing from its respective quarter to merge within the body’s three-colored *qi*. Together they illuminate the chamber, and as one sits within, clouds of *qi* permeate the entire body and the five viscera, both inner and outer suffused in luxuriant abundance, as though seated amid the radiance of a hundred treasures.

Further visualize the azure *qi* within the liver emerging from the left ear to become the Azure Dragon, standing guard on the left; the white *qi* within the lungs issuing from the right ear to become the White Tiger, stationed on the right; the crimson *qi* within the heart rising from the crown of the head to become the Vermilion Bird, leading the way before; and the black *qi* within the kidneys flowing forth from the feet to become the Dark Warrior, following behind. From the Lower Cinnabar Field below the navel emerges a lion, and from the space between the brows above the forehead emerges a white crane, each in groups of thirty-six, guiding the way ahead. Jade lads and jade maidens attend beside the scripture table, arrayed to left and right.

Next, contemplate the six palaces of the viscera: from the two small cavities behind the brows, the sun and moon emerge, their purple and crimson ninefold rays streaming into the nostrils and entering the Golden Flower Palace. From the palace of the Jade Pillow, four inches behind the brain, a nine-colored circular image takes form atop the crown, like a rainbow’s radiance, its light illuminating and penetrating the sacred realms of the ten directions. Visualize the infant within the Cinnabar Field, silently reciting the incantation to the measure of *"Savior of Boundless Beings,"* then proceed with the recitation as intended. After reaching the Primordial Thearch in the recitation before the table, draw in the *qi* of the thirty-two heavens, fully circulating it through the ten directions, and softly recite the scripture ten times.

When drawing in the *qi*, begin again with the Supreme August Yellow Brilliance Heaven, inhaling through the nose and swallowing it. For the *qi* of the eight eastern heavens, visualize it returning to the liver and gallbladder, where its essence transforms into the Venerable Lord of Non-Florescence, dwelling within the liver. For the *qi* of the eight southern heavens, visualize it returning to the heart and pericardium, where its essence transforms into the Controller of Destiny, dwelling within the heart. For the *qi* of the eight western heavens, visualize it returning to the viscera and skin, where its essence transforms into the White Prime Honored Spirit, dwelling within the lungs. For the black *qi* of the eight northern heavens, visualize it returning to the kidneys and bones, where its essence transforms into the Lord of Peach Vitality, dwelling below the navel.

Practice from the first month through the sixth month follows the same method; practice from the seventh month through the ninth month likewise follows the same method.

From the tenth month through the twelfth month, the practice follows the same method.

The first month’s practice is conducted in the lower *dantian*; the seventh month’s practice is conducted in the middle *dantian*; the tenth month’s practice is conducted in the upper *dantian*. These are called the Three Fields, also known as the Three Palaces of Ascent and Descent.

In the first month’s practice, one’s own Infant, emerging from the *dantian*, follows the three-colored cloud-*qi* to ascend and descend within the lower field below the navel, the practice remaining uniform.

In the seventh month’s practice, one’s own Infant, emerging from the *dantian*, follows the three-colored cloud-*qi* to ascend within the middle field above the heart, the practice remaining uniform.

In the tenth month’s practice, one’s own Infant, emerging from the *dantian*, follows the three-colored cloud-*qi* to ascend within the upper field at the *yintang*, the practice remaining uniform.

**Recitation Formula**

The August Person says: Whenever reciting scriptures or practicing the Dao, one must wear the true talisman. By practicing this Way, the myriad spirits will show reverence and follow.

The day of practice refers to the day appointed for scripture recitation, on which one must bathe.

The fragrant water is a decoction of five aromatics: *baizhi* (Angelica dahurica), *qingmuxiang* (Aristolochia debilis), *chenxiang* (Aquilaria), *baitanxiang* (Santalum album), and *gansongxiang* (Nardostachys jatamansi). Take twenty-four *zhū* of each, grind and sift them, then boil in one *dàn* of east-flowing spring water until it bubbles several times. First, disrobe, burn incense, and sit to the left. Visualize the radiant essence of the sun’s five-colored light interweaving and entering the five-fragrance decoction. Visualize five Perfected Youths of the Five Directions and five Jade Maidens burning incense, scattering blossoms, and holding towels and water on either side. Then, stir the water thirty-two times with a ladle and recite the incantation over the water:

*"Five-fragrance mystic spring,
Sun-and-moon radiant essence.
Purify and refine the body’s form,
Dispel the turbid, retain the pure.
Corpse-dust vanishes, viscera shine bright,
Foul *qi* is swept away, the root of calamity scattered.
Riding emptiness through the void,
Soar into the Upper Clarity."*

The talisman for bathing follows.

After reciting the incantation, strike the teeth thirty-two times. First, take a sip of the water, adjusting its temperature to one’s comfort. Then, use another vessel to bathe while reciting the incantation:

The Supreme Thearch loosens his hair to grant me long life.
To my left, the hidden moon; to my right, the root of the sun.
Today, in this pure refinement, the hundred spirits receive grace.

After reciting the incantation, wash the hair and comb it. Recite the incantation:

*"Essence of sun and moon,
Flowing radiance to the Mud-Pill Palace.
Bathing and nurturing the Nine Palaces,
The hundred spirits rejoice.
Corpse-demons vanish, the true master gazes down.
Bestowed the divine tiger, I become an imperial guest."*

After reciting the incantation, bind the hair and bathe the body.

The various methods of the Three Clarities and the wanderings of immortals below also include the plain broth for refining the corpse: four ounces of peach bark and two ounces of bamboo leaves, steeped with pure, empty, and refined substances to make a decoction for bathing—superior to all other miscellaneous methods.

Among these is the green wood fragrance of the Divine Mother. The *Great Possession of the Three Marvels Scripture* states: it is the pure fragrance of the Jade Stem, dispelling the turbidity of worldly dust. It is also called the five-fragrance broth. If sincerely offered to the Supreme Mystery, burning it will dispel worldly impurities and open the path to the celestial realms.

After bathing, don the cap and sash. Recite the incantation:

On this auspicious day, may it align with the Emperor’s grace.
The worldly filth is cleansed, the corpse-soul sinks into obscurity.
Sins, stains, karmic misfortunes—both within and without—are swept away.
Inhaling the sun, exhaling the moon, I tread the Nine Mornings.
Revolving through the Three Terraces, I wander among the Five Stars.
Adorned with talismans and scattered scriptures, clad in phoenix robes and tiger skirts,
I grasp the mysterious texts and chant the *Dongling*.
My voice pierces the Great Empyrean, and the Five Emperors turn their chariots.
They bestow upon me the luminous scriptures, allowing ascent to the Upper Clarity.

The incantation complete, don the cap and sash as usual.

Whenever consuming medicinal decoctions or immortal elixirs, recite:
*With reverence, I invoke the Five Elders of the Five Directions and the Five Numinous Ones,
summoning the celestial physicians and the palace scribes of Bian Que, fifty each.
May I, upon taking this medicine, be freed from illness,
and may the illness depart from my body.
Riding the stellar chariots, ascending to the heavens,
I wander the Nine Earths, my destiny and fortune flourishing.
May I attain long life without death and merge with the Dao in truth.*

The incantation complete, face east and consume the medicine.

In practicing this Way, recite the mysterious texts with measured grace,
every movement refined, every gesture imbued with dignity.
Should one act carelessly, coarsely, or recklessly, ghosts and spirits will mock,
and the Three Officials will record the transgressions, correcting the lapses in discipline.
Thus, those who observe the precepts and fasts must adhere to the prescribed rules:
one who claims to be a Daoist must follow the Daoist model,
and one who claims to be a Perfected must emulate the Perfected’s standards—how much more so for a scholar?

Before eating, recite:
*The hundred grains and five flavors flow into the spleen and stomach.
The five viscera are at peace, the corpse-demons perish and fall.
The seven ancestors rest in tranquility, and I attain long life and enduring vision.*

The incantation complete, knock the teeth thirty-two times, swallow the saliva nine times, then eat.
Meals should be taken before noon; avoid eating after the hour of *you*.
Do not speak of death while eating, nor leave food exposed for long.
Before noon, celestial spirits partake; after *you*, demonic forces feed.
Speaking of death, illness, or disease, or leaving food exposed, invites malevolent *qi*.

Thus, the Perfected abstain from grains and enter the mountains to seek the essentials of immortal ascent.

Before sleeping, recite:
*The heavens have nine stars, the earth has nine palaces.
My hundred joints are accompanied by ten thousand spirits.
The Three Corpses lie hidden, the five viscera flow freely.
The Three Fields and four limbs, in motion and stillness, guard the center.
Dragon and Tiger, the Eight Trigrams, attend my radiant form.
Ghosts, demons, and myriad spirits, do not disturb the Perfected’s palace.*

Knock the teeth twenty-four times.
The incantation complete, knock the teeth again as before.
When lying down, do not close the mouth or sleep like a corpse.

Do not lend to others the garments, caps, ritual robes, or utensils of the Upper Way.
Those who practice *qi*-absorption, guard the Three Ones, or recite the mysterious texts must be especially cautious.

When using the privy, knock the teeth three times and recite:
*Left Virtue Spirit, Right Clarity Spirit,
Left Controller Lady, Right Six Ding Spirits—banish filth and evil,
erase my name from the register of death, inscribe it in the book of life.*

Knock the teeth three times. Do not spit or expectorate, do not face north,
do not gaze upward at the Three Luminaries, and do not allow men and women to share the privy—all invite misfortune.

When leaving the house, recite:
*Emerging from yin into yang, the Four Paths open in clarity.
The Eight Spirits and Six Jia follow me, ensuring good fortune.
The sun and moon assist, the Seven Stars crown my head.*

Knock the teeth seven times, visualizing the Seven Stars upon the head, the *Gang* star pointing forward.

**Bathing Talisman**
Recite the bathing incantation three times. Exhale three times to stir the water.
*Golden nectar, jade saliva, cleanse and purify my form.
Mysterious water washes away filth, purifying my primal destiny.
The Seven Numinous Ones stand guard, the myriad *qi* unfold.
Aspiring to purity and emptiness, I align with the luminous and mysterious.*

**First Month Scripture Talisman**
**Seventh Month Scripture Talisman**
**Tenth Month Scripture Talisman**
The above talisman is also called the *Jade Emperor’s Precious Register for Long Life and Enduring Vision*.

**Eight Festivals Scripture Talisman**
For the four talismans above, inscribe in cinnabar on green paper within the oratory.
Practice them in silence; do not speak of them to others.
Those cultivating the truth write in cinnabar on plain paper,
facing southeast on their birthday, burn the talisman, and consume it mixed with pure water.

**Birthday Scripture Talisman**
This talisman is called the *Divine Talisman of the Jade Clarity Immortal King’s Descent*.

When burning the talisman, recite the Lord Emperor’s incantation:
*Divine spirits, celestial Perfected, Primordial Perfected of Jade Clarity,
Perfected of the Upper Clarity’s Flowery Chamber, Original Lord Lao.
Subtly entering the Great Radiance, illuminating the mysterious texts.
The Seven Spirits fly like springs, the Northern Feng receives the smoke.
I hold the position of Upper King, repelling and uniting demonic hordes.
The Eight Awes spew fire, revering your august spirits.
A thousand thousand expel filth, banishing evil without trace.
Ten thousand ten thousand demon kings guard my life and sever my form.
Hasten as the law commands!*

Recite the Jade Emperor’s incantation three times.

When establishing an altar, circumambulate it three times while sprinkling purifying water.

**Methods for Recitation and Verification**

**Reciting the Two Chapters of the Orthodox Scripture**

On the day of recitation, in a purified chamber facing east, arrange the scripture table and seating.
Enter the chamber, face east with the mat behind you, and perform the three bows.
After bowing, withdraw and sit facing north.
Once the *qi* settles, gradually turn left to face east and sit upright.

Recite the *Xuan Yun* incantation.
The incantation complete, place the hands upon the knees, knock the teeth thirty-two times,
close the eyes, and visualize the thirty-two heavens, each with its Emperor.
Meditate upon one heaven’s name and bow in the heart to its Emperor.
Begin with the *Huang Zeng* Heaven, rotating with the day, circling the four directions,
gradually ascending to the *Jia Yi* Heaven, totaling thirty-two bows.
Though the body remains still, the heart prostrates in reverence.

After bowing, visualize the body enveloped in clouds of cyan, yellow, and white *qi*,
filling the chamber in dense, misty abundance.
To the left, the Azure Dragon; to the right, the White Tiger;
ahead, the Vermilion Bird; behind, the Dark Warrior.
Six lions sit in front, two rows facing each other.
An equal number of white cranes stand beyond the lions.
The sun and moon shine from behind, illuminating the chamber.
A nine-colored halo emanates from the crown, piercing all heavens.
Surveying the visualization, all appears vividly before the eyes.

Silently recite the incantation:
*Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord,
summon forth from my body the Three and Five Merit Officers,
the left and right attendants, the incense-bearing Golden Lads,
the message-transmitting Jade Maidens, the Five Emperor’s Direct Talismans,
and the Direct-Day Incense Officials—thirty-two each—to convey my words.*

The matters spoken of—these refer to the heavens and earth, the sun and moon, the stars, the sovereign, master, and friends, ancestors, oneself, and all that the practitioner seeks to pray for. When reciting the incantation, upon reaching the word "convey," one should name them aloud. Today is an auspicious day; within this pure chamber, the scripture is cultivated to deliver countless beings.

The practitioner, along with [name] and [name], shall state their wishes in the same manner, saying: *"This servant and [person] for [matter]..."* Upon completing the scripture, they pray for rebirth. May the words conveyed ascend directly to the Most High Thirty-Two Heavens, before the Supreme Venerable of the Primordial Origin, the Celestial Worthy of Original Commencement.

When the incantation concludes, slowly draw in a breath of *qi* from one of the Thirty-Two Heavens and swallow it. Follow the previous method, and upon completion, open the eyes. After reciting the second chapter of the scripture, face south, descend from the mat, bow again, and withdraw.

The above is established by combining the interpretations of Chen Jingyuan with the oral instructions of Zhang Wanfu.

**Illustration of Silent Sitting**
The right-side diagram generally depicts matters within the chamber; there is no need to face south or open the door when reciting.

**Oral Instructions for Recitation**

Sit upright, knock the teeth five times, and visualize flying dragons and the Dark Warrior with a lush feathered canopy, divine youths and jade maidens in feathered robes and flying garments, with five layers of black clouds enveloping the body.

flowing light ascends to the Upper Clarity.
Great Possession initiates the turning,
eight characters reveal brightness.

**Verses and Ritual Procedures**
The Perfected of the Highest Sageliness have already attained the Way, penetrating the mysterious and investigating the subtle.

The Master says: This passage is not recited by ordinary worldly people. Those who penetrate the mysterious and investigate the subtle, fully comprehending its chapters, obtain merit of the tenth rank.

For the most devoted scholars,
The Master says: Those who are perfected scholars reciting this obtain merit of the sixth rank.

For scholars,
The Master says: Those who are worldly scholars reciting this obtain merit of the third rank.

In reverent offering and worship,
The Master says: All scholars practicing this merit obtain virtuous merit of the fifth rank.

For all who recite this scripture,
The Master says: This also refers to those who have already become Perfected, speaking again of their own merit, karmic rewards, and the liberation of ten thousand ancestors from suffering, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. According to the ranks of the Vermilion Mound, after nine years they are reborn and transformed, becoming noble persons. When their own merit is fulfilled, they ascend to the Golden Gates of the Upper Clarity, permitted to roam and feast in the Jade Capital.

For the most devoted scholars,
The Master says: This refers to the highest learning. They may only attain deliverance for themselves, ascending to the Southern Palace, but their merit does not extend to their great-grandparents.

For worldly people who recite it,
The Master says: They may only extend their lifespan and achieve liberation through the corpse, returning their form to the great void. They do not obtain the fortune of ascending to the Vermilion Mound, and their ancestors scarcely achieve rebirth and transformation.

The demon kings sing the melody,
The Master says: Reciting it a hundred times earns deliverance to the Southern Palace; a thousand times, the demon kings protect and welcome; ten thousand times, one ascends to the great void. This is the song of the Three Realms, not other texts.

Those who hear the numinous sounds,
The Master says: Those whose hearts and forms return to faith, listening attentively to the recitation, obtain virtuous fruit of the ninth rank.

Practicing this merit,
The Master says: Those who resolve to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture obtain virtuous fruit of the second rank.

For the most devoted,
The Master says: The most devoted practicing this merit may attain the rank of minister to the Golden Gates of the Later Sagely Thearch of the Upper Clarity.

Those who understand its sounds,
The Master says: This refers to the middle section. Those who comprehend its text gain equal merit and obtain blessings of the eighth rank.

This sound,
The Master says: The sound of the middle section possesses four kinds of boundless, awe-inspiring, and divine power—warding off, exorcising, delivering, and accomplishing. Those who recite it obtain auspicious responses of the tenth rank.

Presenting gold and treasures as sincerity, swearing an oath to Heaven before transmission, one follows the Mysterious Statutes: once every forty thousand kalpas. Presenting gold and treasures as a pledge of sincerity, one follows the old regulations to report and swear an oath before the Ten Heavens, and only then is the scripture transmitted.

The Master says: These three clauses are the regulations for transmission and reception. The forty thousand kalpas are the measure of the old kalpas. Since the Yellow Thearch received the Chart, Great Yu received the Talisman, and Gaoxin received the Heavenly Scripture, down to the teachings bestowed by the Supreme Ultimate, how could there be forty thousand kalpas? According to the new regulations descended by the Divine Mother, the statutes for bestowing teachings below are revealed once every four hundred years. If there is a suitable person, transmission may be granted again after forty years. Over four hundred years, no more than seven persons in total may receive it. If there is a perfected person every four years, one transmission is also permitted. These three clauses for transmission and reception speak of the two great methods and the forms for reciting the three ranks of scriptures. The melodies of the middle section have separate clear statutes, fully set forth in the Mysterious Statutes of the Immortals’ Ranks. To recite them lightly brings calamity upon oneself. To carelessly leak or slight them brings calamity upon nine generations of ancestors. Leaking or slighting them causes one to fall into hell, with misfortune extending to seven generations of ancestors.

The Master says: These three clauses collectively speak of those who recite the scripture without fasting, bathing, or burning incense, thereby incurring the sin of calamity. If one treats the statutes lightly, carelessly leaks them to the unworthy, or profanes their mysteries; if one does not follow the time limits and transmits them privately; or if one follows the time limits but does not fast, swear an oath, or receive them properly, leaking the secrets to the unworthy and causing them to slight or disbelieve the Mysterious Text—all these fall under the middle statutes, bringing calamity upon nine generations of ancestors. If one leaks or slights them, taking them lightly, seeking novelty through deceit, criticizing the sacred canon, slandering the Mysterious Text, or stealing the Heavenly Treasures—all these fall under this clause, bringing misfortune to seven generations of ancestors.

**Reciting the Mysterious and Evoking Responses**
The Master says: Those who recite the scripture and wish to know its merits should align with the Supreme Mystery, which encompasses one hundred and fifty-one kinds of mysterious responses. Once these responses manifest, the day of ascending as an immortal and rising into the void is near. If no responses appear, one should repent and purify one’s resolve, taking the manifestation of mysterious responses as an auspicious sign.

**Tenth Recitation** – The Perfected Great of the Lower Realm arrives at the Nine Ramparts of the Cavernous Abyss, traveling through the Four Brahma Realms: dry bones. The spirits float through the void to the Thirty-Six Palaces of Sound and the Great Earthly Palaces, and all rise as complete persons.

**Verifying the Recitation of the Two Correct Scriptures**
In the first month, maintain a prolonged fast and recite this scripture to sever the earthly bonds and servitude of the departed souls of past generations, delivering them to the Upper Southern Palace.
In the seventh month, maintain a prolonged fast and recite this scripture to attain immortality and transcendence, have one’s name recorded by the Various Heavens, and have one’s death erased and life inscribed on the Yellow Register and White Tablet.
In the tenth month, maintain a prolonged fast and recite this scripture to pacify and stabilize the realm’s destiny for the king, emperor, lord, ministers, fathers, and sons, ensuring the eternal preservation of the state, the unbroken succession of generations as rulers, the pacification of their lands, and the people’s acclaim of great peace.
On the days of the eight solar terms, recite this scripture to become a Perfected of the Nine Palaces.
On one’s life-destiny day, recite this scripture to clarify and rectify the hun and shen, preserve the myriad qi eternally, avoid suffering and distress, radiate light from the body, receive the attendance of the Three Realms, be welcomed by the Five Thearchs, have the myriad spirits pay homage, have one’s name recorded in the heavens, fulfill one’s merits and complete one’s virtue, and ascend to the Upper Clarity.

Recite it ten times, and the heavens record one’s name.
Recite it a hundred times, and one’s name is registered in the Southern Palace.
Recite it a thousand times, and the Demon Kings provide escort.
Recite it ten thousand times, and the Dao is perfected, allowing ascent to the Great Void.

Should one encounter this celestial moment, recite it according to the method:
Above, it dissolves heavenly calamities and safeguards the emperor’s reign;
Below, it wards off poison and harm to deliver the multitudes;
In the middle, it liberates ancestors, while one’s own self attains the Dao—
This may truly be called sublime.

The Inner Sounds and Their Verifications:
The Great Brahmā Sound of the East—recite it for nine years, and the eight heavens each send eight Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens and eight Azure-Florescence Jade Lads to attend one’s form. They bestow the essence of the Nine Qi of Azure Sprouts, causing one’s body to radiate light, penetrating the Void of Non-Being. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is accomplished, and one soars to the Upper Clarity, with seven generations of ancestors ascending together.

The Great Brahmā Sound of the South—recite it for three years, and the eight heavens each send eight Cinnabar-Rosy Jade Maidens and eight Great Yang Jade Lads to attend one’s form. They bestow the essence of the Three Qi of Vermilion Cinnabar, preserving one’s countenance through ten thousand kalpas without decline. Seven generations of ancestors transcend and ascend, entering the Hall of Blessings, returning to the immortal womb to be reborn anew.

The Great Brahmā Sound of the West—recite it for seven years, and the eight heavens each send eight Luminous Jade Lads to attend one’s form. They bestow the essence of the Seven Qi of Grand Simplicity, halting the years and preserving one’s visage, maintaining a youthful appearance through ten thousand kalpas. Blessings extend to seven generations of ancestors, who ascend and are delivered to the Southern Palace, returning to the womb to be reborn as immortals generation after generation.

The Great Brahmā Sound of the North—recite it for five years, and the eight heavens each send eight Grand Prime Jade Lads to attend one’s form. They bestow the Dark Nourishment, restoring the years and preserving one’s radiance, securing life in the Three Clarities. Blessings extend to the Nine Mysteries, with generation after generation ascending in flight.

For the Inner Sounds of the Four Directions, if one recites them according to the method, then nothing is not averted, nothing is not warded off, nothing is not delivered, and nothing is not accomplished. One soars to observe the world below, and the Supreme Emperor chants from afar. The myriad spirits pay homage, the Three Realms attend in chariots, subduing and pacifying all spirits, purifying the ten directions. When the Dao is perfected and merits are complete, one serves as a minister in the Three Realms.

*Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for the Limitless Salvation of Humanity, Great Rites, Scroll the Third* concludes.
*Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for the Limitless Salvation of Humanity, Great Rites, Scroll the Fourth* begins.

**Chapter on the Exegesis of Scripture’s Meaning**

The Primordial Beginning’s ancestral kalpas give rise to the various heavens. The ancestral kalpas are: *Longhan*, *Yankang*, *Chiming*, *Kaihuang*, and *Shanghuang*.

The Great Brahma Heaven is where the Void Sovereign resides, encompassing heaven and earth, boundless and unfathomable. As the Scripture states:
*"Above, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao is the body."*
Within the span of the five kalpas, heaven and earth are transformed and born.

From the Great Brahma’s single *qi*, the Three Heavens emerge. The realms of the Three Clarities are the Three Heavens descending their *qi*, thereby generating the nine tiers. The first is the *Yudan Wuliang* Heaven; the second, the *Shangshang Shanshan Wuliangshou* Heaven; the third, the *Dongxu Jishang Xuyan* Heaven; the fourth, the *Wuji Shangling Yuxu Yuan Dong Jiran* Heaven; the fifth, the *Dongji Wuya Bujiao Le* Heaven; the sixth, the *Shangji Yuanjing Dongwei Huayingsheng* Heaven; the seventh, the *Wuming Zhiji Fanbao* Heaven; the eighth, the *Taiji Wuya Dongyou Moye* Heaven; the ninth, the *Yuandong Boli Dahe* Heaven.

Each tier further generates three heavens, and the nine tiers together form the Thirty-Six Heavens—what this Scripture refers to as the heavens of *Shangqing*. The lofty and void are all called *Shangqing*, not merely designating a single realm.

Next, the seed-people are divided into the Three Realms and the Thirty-Two Heavens, governing the four directions, situated below the Nine Heavens and above the Three Luminaries. Palaces and chambers are apportioned with graded ranks. Descending to connect with the stellar lodges, primordial *qi* interlinks, transforming and giving birth to the myriad things, shaping and completing all categories.

Beyond this lie the Eight Poles and Eight Heavens, with the Outer Brahma Heaven below the Thirty-Two Heavens and beyond the Three Luminaries. Beyond the Eight Poles, from the *Qingwei* Heaven to the Outer Brahma Heaven, the total number is eighty. Natural *qi* congeals to form palaces and towers. Thereupon, the Void Sovereign appoints each with an Imperial Lord, assists them with Heavenly Ministers, establishes them with subordinate officials, divides them with peoples and creatures, and together with the Great Brahma’s single *qi*, they constitute the Eighty-One Heavens.

As the Dao’s *qi* descends, the Nine Earths are born. The first is *Runse*, the earth named *Yuande*, its *qi* above azure and within yellow, governed by the *Yuantu* Minister. The second is *Gangse*, the earth named *Huangde*, its *qi* pervading black, governed by the *Yuanting* Earth Aide. The third is *Shizhi Seze*, the earth named *Dide*, its *qi* pervading verdant, governed by the *Hukou* Earth Dragon. The fourth is *Runze*, the earth named *Wangde*, its *qi* pervading yellow, governed by the *Yuanxin* Earth Great General. The fifth is *Jinli Ze*, the earth named *Rende*, its *qi* pervading red, governed by the *Yuanfu* Earth Magistrate. The sixth is *Jingang Tieze*, the earth named *Shuide*, its *qi* pervading white, governed by the *Yuangu* Earth Elder. The seventh is *Shuizhi Ze*, the earth named *Lide*, its *qi* purple, governed by the *Jia* Earth Parents. The eighth is *Dafeng Ze*, the earth named *Fude*, its *qi* pervading azure, governed by the *Shixian* Earth Ancestral Rectifier. The ninth is *Dongyuan Wuse Gangwei*, the earth named *Changde*, its *qi* pervading green, governed by the *Xuan* Earth Subordinate of the Two Thousand *Shi*.

These are called the Nine Ramparts, each rampart consisting of one layer each of earth, water, fire, and wind, arranged in ascending and descending order. Each earth is presided over by the Void Sovereign. Additionally, the Four Earth Sovereign Lords jointly govern palaces and assist in equal measure, descending to emulate the heavens above. Altogether, the Thirty-Six Earth Sovereigns correspond above to the emperors of the Nine Tiers and Thirty-Six Heavens.

Beneath the Nine Ramparts lies the vast and desolate palace, enveloped by wind and marsh. The wind and marsh are the *qi* of the Primordial Beginning’s Brahma wind, as unyielding as true metal—also called the *Gang* wind. It upholds the Nine Ramparts, thereby bearing the various heavens, floating high and hollow, suspended yet not falling, connecting above to the Great Brahma—this is the *qi* of the Dao. Thus, the Scripture states: *"The wind marsh is hollow and void; the vajra rides the heavens."*

Now, the Three Caverns interflow, the Nine *Qi* intermingle and arise, floating upon the Great Primordial, surging through the Four Voids. In the vastness of its dharmic form, only the Dao can encompass it.

**The Five Kalpas, named the Primordial Beginning’s Ancestral Kalpas, transform and give birth to the various heavens:**

**The Names of Immortal Realms within the Domain**

The *yue* (mountains) are that which "mirrors" (*zhen*). The *kun* (earth) is thick and bears all things without shifting. The Five Peaks, Three Isles, and Ten Continents are the abodes of immortals and sages.

**Divine Continent (*Shenzhou*)** is the Middle Kingdom, where the Son of Heaven dwells, serving as the greatest realm within the domain. Its people cultivate the true Dao and ascend to become perfected immortals. Above it lie the Ten Great Grotto-Heavens, Thirty-Six Lesser Grotto-Heavens, and Seventy-Two Blessed Lands, all governed by immortal officials. Within the Grotto-Heavens stand the Five Mountains, also called the Five Peaks, which serve as the Middle Kingdom’s *zhen* (mirrors). The remaining minor states are not enumerated here.

The Three Isles of *Shenzhou*, the Five Peaks, and the Ten Continents all lie beneath the Three Luminaries, upon the great earth, and amid the vast seas.

**The Nine Abyssal Grottoes’ Names**
**The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus**

The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus refer to the Three Origins and Nine Palaces.
- The **Upper Origin Palaces** reside above the Nine Heavens.
- The **Middle Origin Palaces** lie between the Nine Earths.
- The **Lower Origin Palaces** dwell within the marsh-grotto abysses.

The Three Origins encompass Nine Palaces, Twenty-Seven Prefectures, and One Hundred Twenty Offices. Innumerable spirits, immortals, perfected beings, and sages—along with all celestial and terrestrial deities—are subject to them. Of the greatest authority are the Three Origins and Three Officials.

*(The above follows Li Shaowei’s annotations, combined with the* Three Origins Precepts Sutra’s Universal Sacred Hierarchy Chart*, to establish this section’s structure.)*

---

**The Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, and Twelve River Sources**

**The Upper Origin’s Three Palaces** are where the Supreme Emperor resides, with the First-Rank Heavenly Palace governing their midst. They comprise Nine Prefectures and Thirty-Six Offices, presiding over the sages of the upper heavens and the transformation of all living things. These palaces are formed from the interweaving of the primordial *qi* of the Original Beginning—azure, yellow, and white—into their structures.

**The Middle Origin’s Three Palaces** are the Supreme Emperor’s detached palaces, governed by the Second-Rank Earthly Officials within. They comprise Nine Prefectures and Forty-Two Offices, overseeing all earthly immortal officials, spirits, and the transformation of living things. These palaces are formed from the congealing of the *qi* of the Primordial Grotto’s chaotic numen and the essence of ultimate yellow, solidifying into their structures.

**The Lower Origin’s Three Palaces** are also the Supreme Emperor’s detached palaces, governed by the Third-Rank Water Officials within. They comprise Nine Prefectures and Forty-Two Offices, presiding over the Dragon Kings of the Eight Seas and Four Rivers, the Water Immortals, and the transformations of yin and yang. These palaces and palatial towers are formed from the intertwining of the *qi* of wind and marsh and the essence of divine vastness.

**The Thirty-Two Heavens: A Comprehensive Summary of Hidden Mysteries**

From the **Grand Yellow Emperor’s Layer** to the **Upper Radiance Seven Luminaries’ Maheśvara Six Heavens** constitute the **Realm of Desire**; from the **Void-Transcending Heng** to the **Boundless *Tanxie* Eighteen Heavens** constitute the **Realm of Form**; from the **Luminous Court’s Cloud-Soaring** to the **Supreme Plain’s Joyous Prohibitions’ Four Upper Heavens** constitute the **Formless Realm**—these are the **Three Realms**.

From the **Supreme Void’s Unsurpassed Constant Fusion** to the **Grand Ultimate’s Level Nurturing *Jiayi* Four Heavens** belong to the **World of Seed-People**.

Upon examining the original scripture, this division is categorized into ten matters:
1. **Heavenly Names and Kalpas** – The names established at the initial division.
2. **Emperor’s Titles** – The titles bestowed by the Original Beginning.
3. **Emperor’s Taboo Names** – The names of the Heavenly Emperors.
4. **Heavenly Emperor’s Governance** – The offices presiding over the Dao.
5. **Constellation *Qi*** – The descending *qi* of the Twenty-Eight Constellations.
6. **Names of *Qi*** – The names of the primordial *qi* received.
7. **Colors of *Qi*** – The colors of the Nine *Qi*’s differentiated powers.
8. **Great Brahma’s Hidden Speech** – The inner sounds, compiled by the Dao Lord. The origins of these matters are detailed in the chapter on inner sounds.
9. **Division of Boundaries** – The ascents and descents of the upper and lower realms.
10. **Lifespans of Heavenly People** – The measures of their longevity.

This chart is the essence of the precious scripture. Those who recite and uphold it should study it in detail and practice accordingly.

*(The above follows Chen Jingyuan’s exegesis, combined with Cheng Xuanying’s commentary, Li Shaowei’s, Xue Youqi’s, and Yan Dong’s annotations on the* Primordial Chart’s Wings of the Cavernous Numinous Chapters’ Inner Sounds and Jade Characters Sutra*, to establish this section.)*

**The Governance of the Five Directions’ Five Emperors**

The scriptural meaning lies in the **Five Heavens**. The Five Heavens receive the *qi* of the Five Spirits and reside in the midst of the Great Void. Above, they array the Five Dipper Stars; below, they establish the Five Peaks, governed by the Five Emperors. These are the directional-colored heavens, not the heavens of formed images.

The names and taboo names of the **Five Elders, Five Emperors, Five Dipper Stars, and Five Great Demon Kings**, along with their governed offices, are matters those who recite the scriptures should certainly know.

*(The above follows Chen Jingyuan’s exegesis, combined with Cheng Xuanying’s commentary and Li Shaowei’s annotations on the* Shangshu’s Essentials of Governance: Chart of the Five Chapters’ True Writ Sutra*, to establish this section.)*

**Constellation *Qi***

The Twenty-Eight Heavens of the Four Directions each correspond to the *qi* of one constellation. The Four Cardinal Heavens each correspond to the *qi* between two constellations. Additionally, the heavens of the northeast, where *qi* descends and intermingles, further correspond to the constellations of the northwest. This is because the ascending *qi* of life spirals upward like a ram’s horn. Though the principle’s flow is the same, confusion arises regarding the directions and cardinal points. Thus, this chart is made to clarify it.

**The Thirty-Five Divisions: The Upper Origin’s Total *Qi***

The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper and the Twenty-Eight Constellations of the Four Directions form the Thirty-Five Divisions, which gather the primordial *qi* in the upper heavens to govern creation.

The **Northern Dipper** is the Central Dipper. As the *Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on the Celestial Offices* states: *"The Dipper is the Emperor’s chariot, revolving at the center, overseeing the four directions. It divides yin and yang, establishes the four seasons, balances the Five Phases, shifts the solar terms, and determines all records—all are tied to the Dipper."*

*(The above follows the* Constellation Chart *to establish this section.)*

**The Number Eight**

The Number Eight corresponds to the numerological principle of eight, which is fully expounded here.

*(The above follows Yan Dong’s annotations on the* Conjoined Dharma Wheels Sutra *to establish this section.)*

**All Stars** – **Eight Heads and Tails**

The Two Chapters of the Heavenly Worthy’s Sutra are arranged in proper sequence. The esoteric utterances of the Great Brahma before and after likewise follow an order. All were composed by the Dao Lord. The details are fully recorded in the *Chapter on the Descent of the Sealed Treasury of Bright Treasures* and the *Chapter on the Causes of the Inner Sounds of Brightness*.

**Chapter on Splitting Characters into Talismans**
**Primordial Beginning Chapter**
The August Personage says: "Primordial Beginning" is the august title of the Heavenly Worthy. There are twelve titles—what do they signify? It is because Lord Lao manifested in ten transformations, the Dao Lord in eleven, and the Primordial Beginning in twelve. Thus, the twelve qi of the center correspond to the Primordial Beginning of the Mysterious Origin, who delivers beings.

These may be employed in accordance with the sutra’s phrases, with the life-saving and death-delivering formulas contained in the middle finger.

1. The Primordial Beginning delivers boundless beings of the highest grade.
2. The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning is about to expound this sutra.
3. The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounds the sutra once.
4. The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning sits suspended in empty space upon a five-colored lion.
5. The Primordial Beginning suspends a precious pearl.
6. The Primordial Beginning is within the precious pearl.
7. The words spoken by the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning in expounding the sutra.
8. The Primordial Beginning, the Most High Lord, before the throne.
9. The Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure, Original Chapter.
10. The Primordial Beginning, in the ancestral kalpa, transforms and gives birth to all heavens.
11. The Primordial Beginning’s talismanic command.
12. The middle section of the Primordial Beginning’s Numinous Writ.

The two characters "Primordial Beginning" dispersed in form.

**Dao Speaks Chapter**
The August Personage says: "The Dao speaks" refers to the jade edict of the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning. There are twelve phrases, corresponding to the number of a year. These may cure all illnesses, summon a thousand spirits, and invoke harmonious qi into the field of the body, forming talismans with the seven qi.

1. The Dao speaks: Once in the Azure Heaven of Beginnings, amidst the azure void’s hymns, in the Great Floating Li Land. In the middle of the middle finger, face the divine Central Palace and inhale the central yellow qi. Draw it into the practitioner’s mouth, connect the qi of the Three Fields, irrigate the field of the body, and blow to seal the talisman.
2. The Dao speaks: At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded the sutra once. The boundless and immeasurable perfected great spirits of the eastern realm of Ultimate Non-Being arrived floating in space. This may subdue violent demons and evil spirits, with formulas to summon by direction.
3. The Dao speaks: The words spoken by the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning in expounding the sutra are all the inner names of the Heavenly Emperors among the heavens, the hidden rhymes of sounds. They are also the inner taboos of demon kings, the secret names of the hundred spirits. Write the characters of the heavens’ names and taboos in seal script for use in esoteric incantations.
4. The Dao speaks: For every ten recitations of this sutra, all the heavens arrive. On the nail of the middle finger, summon the lofty perfected of the ten directions, the flying heavenly spirit-kings, and those receiving deliverance.
5. The Dao speaks: In the first month, maintain a prolonged fast and recite this sutra. In the middle of the middle finger, for every recitation of the sutra, first ingest the qi of the seasonal node.
6. The Dao speaks: On the day of performing the Dao. In the middle of the middle finger, ascend the altar to pay homage, cure illnesses, and subdue demons—first ingest or wear this.
7. The Dao speaks: These two chapters are the hidden and secret sounds of the Heavenly Emperors among the heavens and even the demon kings. On the fourth finger, for every writing of jade characters, first ingest this.
8. The Dao speaks: As for the revolutions of heaven and earth, to the universal deliverance of the primordial kalpa. In the middle of the thumb, employ as needed with the sutra’s phrases.
9. The Dao speaks: Those of shallow learning in the Dao, to swiftly attain immortality. Write on the nails of the five fingers; for every petition to redress transgressions, first ingest this.
10. The Dao speaks: As for the end of heaven and earth’s revolutions, to the boundless deliverance of beings. Write on the lower joint of the middle finger, employing as needed with the sutra’s phrases.
11. The Dao speaks: For all who possess this sutra. In the middle of the middle finger, one may summon the Great Unity demon of the Three Realms and recommend ascension as an immortal.
12. The Dao speaks: These esoteric utterances of the Great Brahma among the heavens are boundless sounds. At the hours of *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai*, one may submit memorials and petitions; wearing this, one may cross the Dipper’s vastness and directly ascend to the heavenly gates.

**Chapter on the Forest of Manifestations and the Pure Radiance**
The August Personage says: The Forest of Manifestations is the light of the ten thousand images, paying homage to the imperial throne. The Pure Radiance is the Yellow Flower of the Eastern Well, the Dan Pool—where the perfected immortals of all heavens refine their forms. Thus, the sinful souls of the lower world, if refined in the spring of the Yellow Flower of Pure Radiance, may dispel their yin obscurations and ascend to the yang realm. Practitioners who refine their forms may attain the Way of corpse liberation, avoid hell, and roam the great void.

When writing, place the left hand’s middle finger in the grip, hold the brush in the right hand, face the Heavenly Gate, inhale qi twelve times, blow upon the brush, and recite the incantation to complete the talisman.

**Golden Nectar and Jade Elixir, the Cavern’s Radiance and Cinnabar Yang.**
**The Orthodox Qi of the Numinous Treasure, the Forest of Manifestations’ luminous splendor.**

Thus the chant resounds—
those who cannot be reborn anew,
from whom ten thousand calamities recoil,
walk alone through Jade Capital’s halls.
Majestic, the Great Brahmā’s virtue
cannot be surpassed.

Rivers and seas grow still,
mountains and peaks conceal the clouds,
sun and moon suspend their radiance,
the turning heavens halt their course.
All demons bind their forms,
ghostly spirits lose their clarity.

The dead return to life,
white bones become human once more.
The Five Thearchs stand guard,
the body merges with the Dao of the Cavernous Truth.
The Three Realms bow in reverence,
penetrating the profound, fathoming the subtle.

Demon essences lose their sight,
ghostly apparitions vanish in obscurity.
Power unmatched governs heaven’s decree,
virtue subdues earth’s divinities.

When merit is complete and virtue perfected,
all attain the immortals’ way,
ascending to the Golden Gates,
roaming and feasting in Jade Capital’s halls.

Amidst the three-hued clouds of qi,
within and without, luminous clarity reigns.
Azure Dragon, White Tiger,
Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior,
lions and white cranes,
sun and moon illuminate with brilliance.

Within the Cavernous Radiance Chamber,
a halo of light crowns the head.
The Three and Five Merit Officers,
attendant officials to left and right,
incense-bearing Golden Lads,
message-bearing Jade Maidens,
the Five Thearchs’ direct talismans,
the incense officials of the day—
today is auspicious,
a long fast in the pure hall.

The Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery,
the Numinous Treasure’s original scripture,
parting and uniting by nature,
the primordial chaos of crimson script.
From the Primordial Ancestor’s kalpa,
all heavens were transformed and born.
The Three Luminaries revealed—
this is the root of heaven.

Without script, no illumination,
without script, no clarity,
without script, no completion,
without script, no deliverance,
without script, no establishment,
without script, no life—
the Heaven within Heaven.

At Yu Luo’s Pine Terrace,
the Great Jade Clarity of the Great Dao—
dim and distant, the kalpa’s blade,
now gone, now present.
The Three Flowers part at will,
the wondrous court of Great Possession.
Golden towers, jade chambers,
the vast array in pure radiance.

The great flow of Brahman qi—
within it, the gods who deliver the dead to immortality,
within it, the Southern Culmen’s Lord of Longevity,
within it, the world-delivering Marshal of the Sima,
within it, the life-cherishing Elder Han,
within it, the Southern Supreme’s Officers of Fate and Record,
the august spirits who extend life and augment destiny,
who turn back the startled dead,
who deliver boundless beings.

The Five Elders open the way,
the host of immortals flank the chariot,
the chancellors of all heavens,
the Southern Prosperity’s Upper Palace,
the life-monitoring great gods,
Han’s Officers of Record—
holding talismans, grasping registers,
all assemble before the Thearch.
As each is to be delivered,
the heavens are strictly examined.

The Northern Capital’s Feng Du,
the Three Offices, the Nine Bureaus,
the Twelve River Sources—
above, the ancestors are absolved,
the karmic kin of a hundred kalpas.
Swiftly the ledgers of sin are erased,
the roots of evil extinguished.
No restraint, no detention,
no coercion by ghostly throngs.

By the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic decree,
moment by moment they ascend.
In the Northern Capital’s Frigid Pool,
the hun-souls are escorted and guarded,
the dead souls receive refinement,
transmuted into immortals.
The living bodies receive deliverance,
kalpa after kalpa abiding,
revolving with the kalpas,
their years equaling heaven’s.
Ever delivered from the Three Wretched Paths,
the Five Sufferings, the Eight Adversities.

The Supreme August Yellow Canopy Heaven,
the Clear Brightness of He and Tong Heaven.

The Mystic Womb’s Even-Nurturing Heaven,
the Grand Luminous Jade-Perfect Heaven,
the Primordial Luminous Literary-Florescence Heaven,
the Supreme Luminous Seven Luminaries’ Maheśvara Heaven,
the Void Transcending the Celestial Balance Heaven,
the Supreme Ultimate’s Veiling Mist Heaven,
the Vermilion Luminance’s Harmonious Yang Heaven,
the Mystic Luminance’s Reverent Florescence Heaven,
the Radiant Luminance’s Ancestral Whirlwind Heaven,

the Void Luminance’s Hall of Radiance Heaven,
the Contemplative Luminance’s Upright Quiescence Heaven,
the Primordial Luminance’s Reverent Jubilation Heaven,
the Grand Resplendent Ultimate Jade Heaven,
the Primordial Vastness’ Aperture-Ascending Heaven,
the Grand Peace’s August Cliff Heaven,
the Manifest Quiescence’s Ultimate Wind Heaven,
the Origin-August’s Filial Awn Heaven,

the Boundless’s Dharma-Oath Heaven,
the Luminous Court’s Cloud-Crossing Heaven,
the Abyssal Communion’s Primordial Cavern Heaven,

the Grand Simplicity’s Elegant Joyous Forbidden Upper Heaven,
the Grand Void’s Supreme Eternal Fusion Heaven,
the Grand Release’s Jade Exaltation’s Soaring Victory Heaven,
the Dragon-Transformation’s Brahman-Crossing Heaven,
the Supreme Ultimate’s Even-Nurturing Jia-Yi Heaven.
Nine Harmonies, Ten Unions—
transforming into the Upper Clarity.
Entreat the eradication of the Three Evils,
severing the roots of earth.
Ba-Yuan the Ugly Earl,
bearing heaven, shouldering stone,
reversing the mountain’s six-eyed gaze.
Jian-Chou the Brightly Fragrant,
hoisting heaven with transverse strength—
the ancestral origin of the ten thousand spirits.

The Marshal-General commands the ghostly legions,
wielding banners, drums, and batons—
roaming the vast heavens, self-styled in resplendent might.
The Divine Lords receive their mandate,
sweeping away all misfortune.
Eight Fierce Ones spew venom,
mighty steeds spread in four directions.
Heavenly Soldiers lead the vanguard,
Great Generals brandish their pennants,
hurling fire for ten thousand leagues,
streaming bells in eightfold surges.
Should any dare to resist,
opposing the Perfected Ones above—
golden axes strike first,
the Great Queen of Heaven metes punishment,
slaughtering and severing ghostly shades.
Wind and fire cease not:
thousands upon thousands of heads severed,
myriads upon myriads of forms annihilated.
Demons dare not trespass,
ghosts dare not manifest as specters.
The Three Officials of Northern Feng
inspect the ghostly camps with clarity—
none may conceal themselves.
The Golden Horse’s courier route
proclaims boundless decrees.
All spirits heed:
wind and marsh penetrate the void,
Vajra ascends the heavens.
Within the Mysterious, the Grand Sovereign,
the Lofty Perfected of the Supreme,
the Purple Void’s luxuriant splendor—
assist and guard the myriad immortals.
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—
naturally attaining perfection.
Within the Perfected dwells the divine,
eternal life and supreme goodness.
The Peerless Duke,
the White Prime Honored Spirit,
the Great One who Oversees Destiny,
the Peach and Health Decree’s Artisan—
descend to guard the human body,
the Crimson Palace of the Mud-Pill,
governing the fivefold qi within,
blending the hundred spirits as one.
Thus are the cavernous scriptures composed,
transforming and soaring through the void—
to test your being,
trialing resolve and retreat.

How few attain this Way—
those who grasp the talismans, hold the registers,
bind demonic spirits with the *Lingbao* divine spells—
utterances of the Great Brahma,
the celestial’s spontaneous numinous tones,
not the common speech of this world.
The ancient script stretched a full *zhang* in length.
Once transmitted by the Venerable One of Mount Qingcheng from the Most High Lord of the Dao,
whoever recites them subdues the hundred demons,
dissolves demonic ghosts in silence,
while the myriad spirits guard and protect.
Inscribe their talismanic script,
form it into a pellet and swallow—
one may ascend to the Mysterious Void of the Great Empyrean.
Recite the spell a hundred times,
and when the Dao is complete,
the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings descend to observe the body,
record its merits and toils,
and memorialize the Ten Heavens—
thus may one attain the spontaneous principle of the *Lingbao* and Primordial Beginning.
From this spell, one or two characters may be imparted to mortals,
their power responding to fortune and misfortune,
birth and death, good and ill—
unerring in effect.
If a perfected one receives it,
pledging heart and treasure in golden offering,
swearing an oath to heaven before transmission—
to leak or profane it lightly
brings calamity upon nine generations.
Wherever this scripture resides,
if spectral evil brings harm,
inscribe its talismans to suppress it—
all other spirits and demons transform into water,
their nature restored to spontaneity,
fulfilling the great principle of the Dao.

Here ends *Scroll Five of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure Scripture of Limitless Salvation*.

**The Dao of Immortals is Ever Auspicious**
**The Dao of Ghosts is Ever Inauspicious**
The loftiest, pure, and radiant spirits
Sing mournful songs that resound through the vast heavens.
I only wish the Dao of Immortals to flourish,
Not for the Dao of Humans to languish in destitution.
In the Northern Capital’s Yellow Springs and Crooked Mansion,
A myriad of ghosts gather in throngs.
They seek only to cut short human fate,
Severing the Gate of Human Life.
Ah! Sing the cavernous hymns,
To subdue the Northern Feng of Luo.
Bind and dispatch the demons and malevolent spirits,
Sever the blades of the Six Ghostly Legions.
The qi of all heavens surges boundlessly—
My Dao daily ascends in glory.
Lofty and resplendent, it soars high,
Illuminating qi in all four directions.
The pure conduct of the Brahma heavens,
Encircling the ten directions,
The boundless great deities—
All arise from this body of mine.
I possess the cavernous hymns,
A myriad recitations to attain immortality.
The Dao of Immortals values deliverance,
Yet the Dao of Ghosts clings fast.
Heaven and earth stretch vast and desolate,
Defiled qi swirls in profusion.
The Three Realms rejoice—
Pass beyond them, and abide eternally.
When this body crosses into my realm,
Its form merges with spontaneity.
At this moment, joy abounds—
Yet how fleeting, for it flows from my grace.
The Dragon Han era surges boundlessly—
How can one discern the true?
My realm is difficult to cross,
Thus I compose these cavernous texts.
Transforming and soaring through the void,
To test this body of mine.
Success or failure, slackening or retreat—
How few are those who attain deliverance?
I laugh at those who do not cross over,
Thus I sing this melody.
Above the Three Realms,
The boundless Great Luo stretches on.
No root of form exists there,
Cloud-layers towering, majestic and high.

Only the Primordial Beginning, the House of Vast Kalpas,
ordains and governs my realm,
receiving its mandate from the Mysterious Capital.
Those who transgress my realm
enter the Jade Void—
I reign as the Supreme King,
rectifying and subduing the hordes of demons.
Ten thousand transformations fill the void,
defiled qi blooms in profusion.
Few preserve their authenticity,
many fall into delusion.
The Dao of immortals is hard to stabilize,
the path of ghosts easily turns crooked.
The human path lies in the heart—
truly, it does not depend on others.
The Dao of immortals values substance,
the human path values splendor.
If you do not delight in the immortal Dao,
how can you pass beyond the Three Realms?
Should you desire to traverse the Five Paths,
what recourse shall I have?

The Demon Kings pay homage in form,
commanding and restraining the earthly deities,
forever parting from ghostly offices.
The soul crosses the Cinnabar Mound,
passing through the Three Realms,
undergoing refinement to birth the spirit—
this is called the Boundless.
Universally delivering the limitless,
inscribing talismans and reciting incantations:

"Celestial crystal, primordial and vast,
earth expansive, rivers flowing.
Thunder Duke dispels evil,
Thunder Mother responds to heaven.
Spirits of straw men,
serving for ten thousand years.
Wondrous trees,
dare to approach the altar.
Lu lu ling ling,
assist on all four sides.
Divine spirits below,
summon your souls.
Arrive instantly at my command,
foretelling a thousand years.
Attach and arrive at once,
responding in due time.
Se se li li,
spirits swiftly gather.
Xie xie Ji Di,
the sacred tortoise commands.
Hasten! As the Supreme Numinous Treasure decrees."

With the right method, trace the Mao script with the left hand while reciting,
using cinnabar on yellow paper, as per the preceding text.

**Chapter on the Radiant Stabilization of Divine Light**

For seven days and seven nights, the sun, moon, and stars of all heavens halt their wheels—Xuanji and Yuheng stand still. The divine wind falls silent; mountains and peaks conceal their clouds. The sky is free of drifting veils; the four *qi* shine in clarity. Throughout the land—its mountains, rivers, forests, and trees—all levels as one, no longer high or low. The earth transforms into green jade, uniform in hue.

The Perfected attend in assembly as the Most High Lord of the Dao sits suspended in empty space upon a five-colored lion. The Mystic Master says: This speaks of the primordial bequest of the Heavenly Worthy, whose wondrous application of divine transformation and responsive mechanism brings forth such manifestations. Though it is said that for seven days and seven nights the sun, moon, and stars halt their wheels, how then is the count of seven days and seven nights distinguished? Moreover, this is not solely the Floating Black Soil of the Jade Clarity Heaven—such numinous and wondrous transformations occur likewise. What the Dao Lord describes is the simultaneous response of all heavens; throughout the Three Realms and the myriad heavens of the ten directions, all are thus—this is the subtle and sacred resonance.

In the Heavenly Worthy’s external transformation, the sun and moon do not move, the stars do not revolve, Xuanji and Yuheng halt their wheels, and day and night are no longer manifest. Yet internally, the governing and sustaining functions never cease for even a moment. Thus, the Jade Palace employs the count of seven days and seven nights—not to be compared with the seven days and seven nights of the Jade Clarity or Jade Capital when expounding scriptures, nor with the seven days and seven nights of the human world. Here, "one land" encompasses all heavens and all earths. When it is said that the land levels as one, this signifies that transformation pervades all things without exception, hence "no longer high or low."

From the internal perspective: the sun and moon of the heavens do not blink; the stars do not circulate *qi*; Xuanji and Yuheng do not rest their pulses. The divine wind is silent, without exhalation or inhalation. Mountains and seas conceal their clouds, and yin and yang do not alternate. The sky is free of drifting veils—internally and externally, nothing obstructs. The four *qi* shine in clarity—internally and externally, above and below, all is one. "One land" is like one body; its mountains, rivers, forests, and trees are like the four limbs, the hundred vessels, hair, pores, the chambers of *ying* and *wei*, the spirit abodes, and the joints of the bones. When the earth transforms into green jade, one enters the realm of Daoist stabilization.

The Mystic Master says: From the internal perspective, this is the radiant stabilization of divine light, wherein the Jade Clarity realm is clearly perceived through seven days and seven nights of practice. For seven days and seven nights, the sun and moon halt their wheels, and the eyes do not blink—yet this is neither closing the eyes, nor inner vision, nor gazing directly. It is a prolonged gaze of seven days and seven nights, halting the blinking of the eyes to illuminate the Three Fields, internally and externally resplendent. The *qi* of one’s body circulates through the hundred joints and meridians; yin and yang, *ying* and *wei*, all connect to the breath-pulse of the Three Fields. This breath-pulse is the Xuanji and Yuheng of the human body. The four directions constitute Xuanji; the Three Fields correspond to Yuheng.

When Xuanji does not move, the sun and moon pause in their course, and the stars halt their wheels. When the four directions do not reach, the Three Fields do not rest, and the *qi* and blood of the body cease their circulation. First, one must achieve stillness in the divine wind, without the sound of exhalation or inhalation. Mountains and peaks conceal their clouds, free from the obscuring visions of deluded thoughts. In clarity and profound stillness, the sky’s drifting veils vanish, and the four *qi* naturally harmonize in warmth, coolness, cold, and heat—all things become one in hue. How much more so within the body, where internally and externally all is like green jade, without a speck of dust. Gradually, the hundred spirits guard the gates of death, and the myriad Perfected attend the form of one’s body—one may then ascend bodily into empty space. After a hundred days, the spirit merges with the subtlety of the Dao; after a thousand days, one soars in broad daylight to ascend on high.

The Heavenly Worthy’s suspension in empty space is the dwelling of one’s own primordial spirit in the Jade Clarity Palace—also called the Jade Emperor’s Palace. As it is said: "Within oneself there is a Heavenly Worthy; why gaze upward to heaven?" The eulogy states: Though the Heavenly Worthy is distant and wondrous, in nearness it is the Mud-Pill Palace, whose chambers are all of the seven treasures, with windows and doors naturally distinct.

When the five *qi* gather at the Crimson Palace, the wondrous transformations of numinous power coalesce into a lion. The Heavenly Worthy thereby mounts it and descends into the Cinnabar Field. Left is blue-green, right is white, front is red, back is black, and the center is yellow—hence the five colors. Sitting suspended in empty space, there is transformation in response to the insubstantial and the real, trust in resonance. For seven days and seven nights, the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy is clearly perceived—this is the radiant stabilization of divine light. Ascending to the most wondrous, with merit perfected and encounter complete, one may attain effortless ascent. Yet within stabilization, demonic trials—water, fire, blades, weapons, royal laws, and myriad forms—cling to the slightest reality, and none may attain the Dao. Beyond the seven days and seven nights, what is seen pertains to future events. Should one speak of it, all prior merit is forfeit, and the hope of immortality is lost. How can one not guard one’s words?

The method states: Align the ears with the shoulders, the nose with the navel; gather the six senses. Honor the spirit in the eyes—neither external nor internal—observe the divine light. After three days, within the secluded chamber, a speck of divine light appears; steadfastly stabilize the spirit. After four days, it gradually brightens and expands. By the seventh day, the divine light fills the chamber. Within stabilization, all things are as yet unrealized. When within stabilization one sees all true spirits and ghostly beings, one enters the penetrating vision, beholding the *Chart of Radiant Stabilization of Divine Light* and the *Chart of Xuanji and Yuheng*.

With each inhalation and exhalation, the four directions together measure six inches. One inhalation reaches two directions; one exhalation reaches two directions—each direction measures three inches. Each direction attains fifteen parts, weaving heaven and earth in fifteenfold warp and weft—thus did the Supreme Emperor bestow the *Yellow River Chart* upon the Yellow Emperor.

**Chapter on Penetrating Vision**
Begin with one’s original destiny and practice the stabilization method. After seven days, when stabilization is firm, one may proceed with penetrating vision. If stabilization is not yet achieved, do not practice this. Within empty space, visualize oneself as the Most High Lord of the Dao, the gaze fixed upon what lies ten thousand miles beyond, without regard for what is before one’s face. After another seven days, faint traces gradually appear. With a hundred days of practice, one may sit and observe the Three Worthies, penetratingly behold the Ten Heavens, and see all within the ten directions.

When calamities arise in the year, recite and chant the wondrous scriptures—thus does one become a Perfected of the Nine Palaces.

In practicing this great stabilization and penetrating vision, one must observe two sets of precepts and uphold the great stabilization for three years. Facing the Jade Purity, the Heavenly Worthy bestows a celestial writ, and one ascends in broad daylight to fill a vacancy among the Heavenly Perfected. If one practices the great stabilization without upholding virtue and precepts, wisdom will not arise, and entry into the wondrous subtleties of the Great Vehicle will be difficult. One cannot embody the utmost subtlety or ascend into the Jade Purity.

**Chapter on the Wondrous Precepts of Might and Spirit**
The first precept: maintain equanimity of mind; do not deceive oneself.
The second precept: serve one’s lord and teacher with loyalty; honor and revere heaven, earth, and parents.
The third precept: extend benevolence and compassion to all beings; live in frugality and temperance.
The fourth precept: maintain purity, uprightness, and integrity; do not form cliques.
The fifth precept: revere the supreme Dao and deeply trust in cultivation.
The sixth precept: honor spirits and deities; do not treat them with contempt.
The seventh precept: regard all clothing, food, and possessions as issuing from the primordial qi of the Originator; do not entertain extraneous thoughts.
The eighth precept: cleanse with ash-water and purify defilements; do not indulge in adornment.
The ninth precept: recite with the mouth and prostrate with the heart; do not allow weariness or toil.
The tenth precept: after seven days of great stabilization, the divine radiance becomes resplendent, and the realm of Jade Purity appears.

**Chapter on the Wondrous Virtues of Wisdom**
The first virtue: do not kill.

The second virtue: not to kill.
Where the mind conceives intent, the mouth utters falsehood, or the hand acts in deception—where one incites, aids, instructs, or lures others to slaughter all sentient beings—this is called killing.

The third virtue: not to harm.
Where schemes fester in secret, flattery and treachery are deployed outwardly, or pits, snares, nets, and cruel, unlawful methods are used to injure sentient beings—this is called harming.

The fourth virtue: not to envy.
Where resentment is harbored, malice is concealed, or one seizes an opportunity to slander—where one wishes misfortune upon another—this is called envy.

The fifth virtue: not to be jealous.
Where the heart is stirred in darkness, private desires are nurtured, or one covets another’s beauty—where one schemes to undermine or eradicate another’s abilities or lineage—this is called jealousy.

The sixth virtue: not to lust.
Where the mind strays beyond proper bounds, whether through desire for beauty or wealth, or where one engages in illicit relations with kin, violates familial bonds, or pursues improper unions—where private longings arise regardless of beauty or ugliness—this is called lust.

The seventh virtue: not to steal.
Where walls are breached, seals are broken, locks are forced, or documents are tampered with—where one conceals with private intent, borrows without repayment, or deceives to seize what is not one’s own—this is called stealing.

The eighth virtue: not to covet.
Where words and thoughts lack foundation, and one’s desires expand boundlessly—where, upon beholding the myriad things, one wishes to possess them all, never satisfied, ever seeking to fulfill insatiable cravings—this is called covetousness.

The ninth virtue: not to desire.
Where the mind, like a restless monkey, and the will, like a galloping steed, drive the six senses into motion, stirring the seven emotions—where longing arises from attachment, and desire takes root—this is called desire.

The tenth virtue: not to hate.
Where partiality and attachment lead one to distinguish between fragrance and stench, purity and filth—where one discriminates between high and low, noble and base, refusing to regard all as equal—this is called hatred.

The eleventh virtue: not to be deceitful.
Where suspicion and doubt cloud judgment, where one errs in excess or deficiency, where cunning and deceit arise, or where one obstructs or thwarts others—this is called deceit.

The twelfth virtue: speech without embellishment.
The thirteenth virtue: speech without malice.

The Way of Great Stabilization instructs you, the seeker: observe the mind within stillness, for the mind without mind is the true mind. Observe form without form, for this is the true form. When both mind and form are forgotten, one naturally enters the formless Dao—this is the method of ascending in broad daylight.

The *Hymn of Divine Radiance in Great Stabilization* by the Perfected One of the Grand Unity says:
In profound obscurity, the mind is absent;
In the great abyss, form is concealed.
Azure hues merge as one,
Preserving transformation and congealing spirit.
Light as a feather, unmoving,
Within and without, the true is contained.
The tortoise devours the crimson serpent,
Weaving the essence of true refinement.
Sun and moon grow dim,
The celestial pivot ceases its ascent.
White mist and azure haze
Intertwine in ceaseless exchange.
After seven days of divine penetration,
The Jade Purity realm appears of itself.

The Wondrous Rank of the Millet-Grain Man
When the ten recitations of the scripture were complete, the Perfected Great Spirits of the Ten Directions and the boundless Celestial Worthies arrived as one. The men and women of the land turned their hearts in reverence and devotion. They came like fine rain or dense mist, their numbers beyond measure—so vast that half the land sank beneath their weight, yet none could be turned away.

Then the Originator suspended a single treasure-pearl, no larger than a millet grain, in the void five *zhang* above the earth. The Originator ascended and led the Perfected Great Spirits, the Most High and Venerable Ones, and the Realized Ones of Wondrous Conduct—an innumerable host—into the pearl. From below, the celestial beings gazed upward and saw only a shimmering light entering the pearl’s mouth. Once inside, its destination was unknown. The people dispersed, and the land returned to levelness, the unevenness no more.

The Mystic Master said: When the ten recitations of the scripture were complete, the Great Spirits of the Ten Directions and the boundless Celestial Worthies arrived as one. The power of wisdom was summoned, weaving auspicious responses, and the entire land was protected and delivered, all attaining longevity. Thus, they turned their hearts in devotion, and the whole nation came to the place where the scripture was expounded. Like fine rain or dense mist, their numbers were beyond reckoning—hence the term "innumerable host." The myriad heavens speak of "one land," and when that land gathers in the Great Floating Li Realm, the earth cannot bear its weight. Yet by the profound power of the Heavenly Worthy’s scripture and the vastness of the innumerable host, the land was pressed down and half of it sank, though the multitude could not be restrained.

Thus, the Heavenly Worthy enacted a wondrous transformation: suspending a treasure-pearl no larger than a millet grain in the void, five *zhang* above the earth, beyond the realm of defilement. The Perfected Great Spirits, the Nine Ranks of the Upper Primordial Perfected, the Most High and Venerable Ones, the Nine Ranks of the Middle Primordial Sages, and the Realized Ones of Wondrous Conduct, along with the Nine Ranks of the Lower Primordial Immortals, followed the Heavenly Worthy’s ascent and entered the pearl as one. All other celestial beings, not being Perfected Great Spirits, Most High Sages, or Realized Ones, could not follow the transformative mechanism of non-action and thus could not enter the wondrous void of the millet-grain pearl. They could only gaze upward, seeing the shimmering light enter the pearl’s mouth. Once inside, its destination was unknown.

Even lesser immortals possess the wonder of holding Mount Sumeru in a mustard seed or the scenery of heaven and earth in a gourd—how much more so the Great Sage! The Heavenly Worthy, in expounding the great teaching, manifested divine transformations. Though the pearl was no larger than a millet grain—already wondrous in itself—being five *zhang* above the earth, only celestial beings could perceive it suspended in the void. How much rarer still to witness its mouth! Truly, the Heavenly Worthy led the Perfected and Sages into the wondrous realm of being and non-being. As they followed the Heavenly Worthy into the pearl, the celestial beings below saw its mouth. Once all had entered, the pearl’s interior—its profound and wondrous transformation—became invisible to them. Thus, the people dispersed, the land returned to levelness, and the unevenness vanished. Such was the scene of the scripture’s recitation and the wonder of the Heavenly Worthy’s pearl.

In the words of the Great Dao: the divine penetration of the Dao is vast, encompassing all without limit, entering all without exception. When gathered, it takes form; when transformed, it becomes an innumerable host, all reduced to the subtlety of a hair or mustard seed. Such is its power when concentrated.

When dispersed, it arises from non-being into being, pervading the myriad heavens and all lands, dividing its form into countless millions—nothing it does not reach, nothing it does not penetrate. Such is its state when scattered.

At five *zhang* above the earth, one transcends the five desires and five dusts, the five aggregates and five colors, the five fragrances and five sounds, the five turbidities—beyond the reckoning of the Five Agents, thus entering the wondrous subtlety of emptiness and mystery.

The grain of millet is the chief among the five cereals. A single land is likened to the body. The uneven sinking signifies the Dao’s inclination and pursuit, its unity not yet complete, thus unworthy of the profound transformation of the Double Mystery.

The *tianren* are the myriad spirits. The Perfected of the Upper Saints and the Heavenly Worthies, the Realized Ones of wondrous practice—these are the spirits of the Three Primes. The Heavenly Worthy is the master of the body entire.

Spoken in terms of the wondrous inner vision of the Dao, this is the esoteric formula of the Jade Clarity’s divine pearl and the alchemical embryo of the immortals. In the great method, it is the practice of grain avoidance to cure illness. In recitation and cultivation, it is the ritual of numinous power and mysterious penetration, the rank of dispelling calamity and summoning fortune.

The Mystic Master said: After nine revolutions and ten cycles, when the work is complete, one attains the proof of passing from being into non-being, the wondrous subtlety of emptiness and the grain of millet. First summon the yang essence, then the yin radiance—entering like fine rain or dense mist, suffusing the entire body. The primordial *qi* circulates ten times; the spirit transforms the original valley. When the primordial *qi* returns once more, the host of *qi* follows in unison, transmuting into the mysterious cinnabar of the millet grain, settling in the numinous palace of the Yellow Court. When the elixir is formed and pierces the sun, consuming it, one instantly mounts the clouds and ascends to Jade Clarity, attaining the rank of Perfected.

The *Tai Xuan* Perfected’s *Hymn on the Millet Grain Entering the Mystery* says:
The numinous gaze rivals heaven, in resonance with the Great Mystery.
Three days of yang unite; seven dawns complete the yin.
The thirteenth is the position of *kun*; the eighteenth links *qian*.
Full and new moons bear the talisman; eight forms the crescent.
On the twenty-third night, yin and yang merge in origin.
The evening sun is the constant Dao—this assembly unites the Three Fields.
If a single speck is tainted, the unbroken continuity is lost.

Within the Mud-Pill Palace dwells the Great One;
At the Center presides the Director of Destinies;
At the Gate of Life, Peach Vitality and Unaging Lord;
The Lad of No-Flourish.

The Master of the Mysteries states: The talisman for the Harmonious Union of the Five Spirits—when adepts practice the *Ling Bao* Seven Classics and Eight Taboo-Names, along with all inner cultivation methods—should be inscribed in cinnabar upon yellow silk. Each morning, facing east, one swallows a single talisman. The *Shangqing* oral instructions prescribe the Five Directions’ *qi* to be blown onto the talisman. Thus, the Five Spirits guard and protect, the Three Ones abide perpetually, and all visualization practices and applications become efficacious without fail.

The *Ode of the Five Qi in the Central Principle* by the Wondrous-Practice Perfected:
One *qi* pays homage to the ancestral source, entering the Eight Darknesses.
The Gate of Heaven and Door of Earth—opening, closing, blocking, and flowing.
Life’s root lies in the Supreme Tenuity; the luminous beam is the ancestral *qi*.
Heaven enters to become yang; the Gate of Heaven is yin.
Earth’s release is true; receiving and expelling are the work of the perverse.
Water and fire arrive together; the hundred spirits turn eastward,
Returning to the Valley Chamber.

*Concluding the Eighth Scroll of the Great Method of the Supreme Ling Bao Wuliang Duren Shangjing*

**Ninth Scroll of the Great Method of the Supreme Ling Bao Wuliang Duren Shangjing**
**The Ten Revolutions of Returning Spirit**

The Ten Revolutions of Returning Spirit—ten thousand *qi* ascend as immortals together.

The Master of the Mysteries states: The Dao of the Ten Revolutions embodies the principle of the Five Phases’ generation and completion. The method of the Ten Revolutions was expounded by the Heavenly Worthy in ten recitations of the scripture, wherein the divine transformations manifest this principle.

The Host of Perfected Ones attended the assembly.
The Master of the Mysteries states: When the true beings of the body gather, this discourse may be discussed.
When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy recited the scripture once, all the great sages of the heavens simultaneously voiced their approval. At that moment, all the deaf and ailing in the land had their ears opened to hearing.
The Master of the Mysteries states: When the true beings gather in constant goodness, the water number generates the One. The entire world receives grace; water arises and ascends in audience, flowing through mountains and valleys, bathing the kidneys to augment wisdom. The deaf gain hearing, and the ailing ears become keen. In terms of the supreme Dao, those lost in sound do not perceive beyond sound; the truly afflicted ear does not hear the soundless—even the greatly wise are deaf. It is said: Obtaining the true flow of water’s One, wisdom ascends and intelligence unfolds, and the ailing ear becomes keen.

When the scripture was recited a second time, the blind regained their sight.
The Master of the Mysteries states: The eyes are the masters of the body’s radiance, the root of the sun and moon’s essence. They are the windows and doors for gathering the true, the numinous source for perceiving the Dao. In the *Shang Dao Prohibited Scripture*, the sun and moon are foremost. Radiance is fire; the pupil at the center is the root of Mars. The sun and moon divide their brilliance—fire’s generative number is two. The true water of Heaven’s One bathes the root of life’s origin. The supreme and mysterious true fire soars and flies within the heart. Thus, light returns and brightness is restored, connecting with the three luminaries’ splendor—this is how the blind regain their sight. Moreover, the root of generation and transformation lies in the splitting of the *jia* from the two kidneys, the origin of the *xu* and *hai*. The water of the kidneys pays homage to the origin; the two pupils congeal above, and fire is born in the heart. Gazing upon the three luminaries in union, the two pupils govern the eyes’ light—this is called *xuyuan*. The generation and nurturing of the supreme Dao are of this same kind.

When the scripture was recited a third time, the mute could speak.
The Master of the Mysteries states: This is the generative number of wood. In terms of the supreme Dao, one thing generates the Five Phases; one color contains five hues. Yin and yang interact, generating and completing, reversing and repeating, concealing their function. Regarding the mute in conventional terms: the lungs govern sound. In the Five Constants’ application, speech is governed by metal, and metal governs voice. Thus, when the Heavenly Worthy recited the scripture thrice, the generative number of wood, the divine transformation’s principle resided in the West—the proper ritual of metal. By summoning metal with wood, the divine transformations reverse and recur—this is how the mute could speak.

When the scripture was recited a fourth time, those afflicted with lameness, paralysis, chronic accumulations, and lingering ailments could all rise and walk.
The Master of the Mysteries states: This is the generative number of metal. Lameness and paralysis refer to the withering of flesh and blood, the contraction and curvature of the four limbs—obstructions, paralysis, lameness, and stiffness. The ailments of chronic accumulation are those passed down through generations, deeply settled and incurable. These conditions involve the relaxation and contraction of sinews and vessels, the obstruction of blood networks—governed by the wood phase, the master of the liver’s *qi* and the web of vessels. However, the fourth revolution pertains to the immortals’ number—precisely the method of the Five Phases’ reversal and completion. In terms of the supreme Dao, the ailments of the Dharma-body perish when metal and wood interact. This is the mutual necessity of water and fire, the mutual affection of metal and wood. Thus, the fourth recitation corresponds to metal’s generative number, accomplishing wood’s divine transformation—this is the meaning.

When the scripture was recited a fifth time, long-standing chronic illnesses were restored to wholeness in an instant.
The Master of the Mysteries states: Five is the generative number of earth’s Dao. Flesh, blood, and bodily form all belong to earth. Thus, the fifth recitation restores form, completing the Five Phases’ embodiment. Deafness, blindness, muteness, lameness, paralysis, chronic accumulations, lingering ailments, and long-standing chronic illnesses are all cured at once, restoring form and wholeness—this is the generative number of the Five Phases.

When the scripture was recited a sixth time, white hair turned black again, and fallen teeth regrew.
The Master of the Mysteries states: This is the generative number of water’s One. It enables the deaf and ailing to regain hearing, while water’s completion number is six. The true water completes its transformation—white hair turns black, and fallen teeth regrow.

When the scripture was recited a seventh time, the old regained their youth, and the young became even stronger.
The Master of the Mysteries states: The seventh recitation corresponds to fire’s completion number. The body’s inner radiance is born; the five viscera’s brilliance shines forth. Externally, the old regain their youth, and the young, upon receiving this, find their countenances and physiques strengthened—all through the work of water and fire.

When the scripture was recited an eighth time, pregnant women, birds, and beasts carrying young—whether born or unborn—all attained completion in birth.
The Master of the Mysteries states: Eight is the completion number of wood. The *qi* of generation nurtures all beings, enabling their completion. The sacred embryo congeals the numinous; the eight *qi* flourish and coalesce. Forms divide and embryos transform, free from all harm—all governed by wood’s generative *qi*.

When the scripture was recited a ninth time, the earth’s treasuries were revealed, and gold and jade manifested openly.
The Master of the Mysteries states: The ninth recitation corresponds to the sacred embryo’s nine revolutions—the completion number of metal. Forms can no longer be concealed; the radiance of gold and the splendor of jade illuminate ten thousand *li*. This is what is meant by a golden countenance and jade visage, a body of jade and limbs of nephrite, bathing and irrigating the entire body.

Exhaling and inhaling animate the myriad beings, transmuting them into gold and jade. Blowing *qi* forms gold; spitting upon the earth yields jade. A hundred blossoms and a thousand hues interlace the body—all through the functioning of the Five Phases, the effusion of gold and jade, and the division of the sacred embryo’s form.

When the scripture is recited a tenth time, withered bones revive, all rising as complete humans.
The Master of the Mysteries states: This is the completion number of earth. It is called the ten revolutions of returning numinosity, where the ten thousand *qi* ascend as immortals together, the decayed skeleton revives, the withered bones transform into immortals, and the dead rise again as complete humans. This tenth recitation’s Dao originates from the Five Phases’ generative numbers. At its culmination, it reaches the Five Phases’ completion numbers. To understand this Dao is to attain longevity; to cultivate it is to become a divine immortal, shedding the mortal coil and ascending in flight—this is its ultimate attainment. When merit is perfected and conduct fulfilled, one attains the rank of Highest Perfected.

Eighty-one days mark one revolution; eight hundred days, the Lesser Vehicle; three thousand days, the Greater Vehicle. Depart not from these words, and all divine immortals shall emerge from their cultivation. Though the myriad methods diverge in path, their affairs converge in principle. The true master’s oral instructions end here.

The Perfected of Dharma-Emptiness’s *Ode on the Ten Revolutions Returning Numinosity, Where the Ten Thousand Qi Ascend as Immortals Together* states:
From one to ten, the Five Phases are the foundation.
Yin and yang revolve in cycles, entering and exiting the sacred barrier.
The sun ascends Fusang; the moon sinks into Dark Yan.
The ten thousand spirits pay homage to the Perfected, attaining unity with the Great Chaos.

The Master of the Mysteries states: The Four Mysteries and Two Dao, the great stabilization of divine radiance. A grain of millet enters the wondrous, where the Five *Qi* reside at the center. The ten revolutions return numinosity. The Perfected expounds it; the ode and gatha reveal its profundities—then ascension has its limits, and enlightenment its origins. Those who grasp its essence become divine immortals.

**Methods of Embryonic Transformation and Dharma-Substance Grades**
The August Person’s Teachings state: The Primordial Beginning’s sacred embryo has the number of ten months for its formation, and the way of the seven heads and five roots.

**Superior Grade: Wondrous Head**
- At fifteen: the Head of No Conduct.
- At twenty-five: the Head of Extended Clarity.
- At thirty-five: the Anāpāna Head.
- At forty-five: the Curved Head.
- At fifty-five: the Head of Reverence in the Three Realms.
- At sixty-five: the Head of Demons Bound.
- At seventy-five: the Head of Spirits Bound.

The Master of the Mysteries states: The Superior Grade’s Wondrous Head requires not nine years of effort. The Head of No Conduct can achieve Perfection in seven years. The Anāpāna Head ascends in broad daylight after nine years. The Head of Extended Clarity fulfills its merit in one cycle and achieves Perfection. The Curved Head attains the Dao through liberation from the corpse after eighteen years. At sixty-five, one becomes an immortal of earth and water, with one’s name recorded in the Celestial Bureau—hence reverence in the Three Realms. At seventy-five, one attains longevity and transcends the world, free from demonic trials—hence the binding of all demons. Those below this extend their heavenly years, and all spirits are bound.

Above lies the colorless root—this is the Heavenly Root. Sever the Earthly Root, preserve the Life-Generating Root, and extinguish the Evil Root.
The Master of the Mysteries states: The colorless root above is where all dust and defilements are purified, entering the grade of thoughtlessness and non-action—this is called

When Heaven and Earth move, qi and blood circulate; when yin and yang revolve, *ying* and *wei* flow. At the conjunction of sun and moon, the inner qi converges; when inner qi converges, the supreme treasure is produced. The supreme treasure gathers to form the Great Elixir; when the Great Elixir is perfected, the sacred embryo is completed.

The path of leakage lies in the assault of the Eight Evils. The foundation of elixir-making lies in the union of the Ten Celestial Stems, matched to the Nine Cauldrons, harmonized with the Nine Colors, and accomplished through the Nine Revolutions.

*The Diagram of the Eight Vessels of the Heart-Pericardium within the Primordial Palace*
*Divine Communication through the Profound Grade*

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign says: When yang is complete, one becomes an immortal; when yin is complete, one becomes a ghost. When yang is complete, the celestial truth may be beheld—hence the *Dongzhen*, *Dongxuan*, and *Dongshen* scriptures. When yin is complete, one joins the company of ghosts—hence the *Dongyin*, *Shuodan*, *Yujue Xuan Yin*, and *Han Ting Chang Ye*.

Humans receive the harmonious qi of the primordial, with yin and yang each half. Those who cannot behold their immortal truth do so because their yang is incomplete. Even a trace of yang prevents one from becoming a ghost; even a wisp of yin prevents one from becoming an immortal. Above the Nine Heavens, yin qi is entirely dissolved; below the Nine Earths, true yang is forever extinguished.

Thus, in practicing the numinous treasure of the Great Law, one must first ensure the body is free from杂务, the mind from stray thoughts, and both inner and outer realms are pure and empty, embracing the primordial and guarding the One. Next, one gathers and ingests the upright qi, refining qi into spirit, expelling pure yin from the body, and descending the yang spirit into the self. Only then may one clearly perceive the hundred spirits, summon and descend the thousand perfected, dispel demonic entities, and avert the five weapons.

The practitioner must recite and chant the sacred scriptures and hymns day and night without negligence to attain spiritual resonance. Should a single word be carelessly revealed, all true spirits will scatter, and success will be utterly unattainable. The practitioner must seal their lips and uphold the practice.

On the days of the Three Origins and Eight Nodal Points, one should bow in reverence and inscribe the talismans for the Ten Great Perfected, Ten Great Jade Lads, and Ten Great Jade Maidens to summon the true spirits. Within the method, the Five Thearchs’ Jade Lads and the attendant Jade Maidens of the Immortal Offices shall, along with the spirit officials, guardian deities of the Dao, and rectifying spirits, be stationed behind the sleeping couch.

Prepare a small chamber, arrange the sacred seats of the Immortal Offices, the registers of the method, and other scriptures, and offer incense, flowers, seasonal fruits, and other supplies for their oversight. They shall monitor, record, and report the practitioner’s merits, transgressions, movements, and stillness, as well as the responses of the guardians.

On an auspicious day, enter the oratory, conclude the morning audience with the perfected, and visualize the Three Treasures, each receiving a tablet of azure jade inscribed in gold characters. The true qi is nine inches long and five inches wide, inscribed as the *True Qi of Jade Clarity*, the *True Qi of Supreme Clarity*, and the *True Qi of Grand Clarity*. After receiving them, bow twice, withdraw, and recite the invocation to the Divine Communicator, the Jade Lads, and Jade Maidens, accumulating ten thousand repetitions. In cold places, warmth is obtained; in hot places, coolness; in weariness, vigor; in foulness, fragrance; in peril, safety—all shall be as desired.

For all matters within and beyond the method, burn incense and pray, and they shall come to inform the practitioner. Whether grand or small, luminous or shadowy, in speech or sound, light or image, color or scene, examine them carefully to discern fortune or misfortune. Memorials may be submitted from afar, and all shall evoke a response.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Perfected of the Great Mystery, the Perfected of the Great One, the Perfected of Fixed Radiance, the Perfected of Wondrous Radiance, the Perfected of Treasure Accumulation, the Perfected of Universal Attainment, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Perfected of Orthodox Unity, the Perfected of the Mysterious One, the Golden Radiance Lad, the Supreme Lad, the Orthodox Lad, the Opening Radiance Lad, the Pure Radiance Lad, the Wisdom Radiance Lad, the Reverent Lad, the Perfect Radiance Lad, the Dao-Eye Lad, the Wisdom-Eye Lad, the Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery, the Jade Maiden of the Azure Waist, the Jade Maiden of the Great Simplicity, the Jade Maiden of the Mysterious Wondrous, the Jade Maidens of the Six Dings, the Jade Maidens of the Three Clarities, the Jade Maidens of the Eight Poles, the Jade Maidens of the Nine Palaces, the Jade Maiden of Numinous Flight, and the Jade Maiden of Transformations—

The Ten Perfected, Jade Lads, and Jade Maidens of this method: should they manifest extraordinary or peculiar forms, or should the practitioner harbor impure thoughts, they shall fall into hell. If one rages or cries out in great anger, or breaks faith and violates the covenant, the spirits will depart far away, and when the moment comes, they will not respond.

To practice the numinous treasure, choose the days of *wuchen*, *wuxu*, *jiwei*, or *jichou* as the starting point. After the *zi* hour on that day, conclude the morning audience with the perfected, face the sacred stars, and step the Dipper from its handle to its mouth. Turn and enter the Dipper’s mouth, then perform nine bows and three pinches of incense. Form the Mudra of the Five Peaks and Three Paths with both hands, hold it before the heart, gaze steadily at a bowl of water, and click the teeth nine times.

Recite the incantation:
*"Kui Gang* is numinous, *Kui Gang* is sacred.
Encountering evil qi, it must respond.
Charge and command, charge and command."*

Recite this nine times, inhale the northern qi toward the heavens, and exhale it into the water. Visualize the character *ling* within the water, and gaze steadily at it.

Recite the incantation:
*"Qian, origin; Kun, benefit; Zhen, upright.
Sun and moon accompany me.
I am neither hungry nor thirsty,
but rely on the purity of the divine water.
The qi of the Five Phases,
the essence of the Six Jias—
divine water enters the five viscera,
forever ensuring peace and tranquility.
Immortals together ascend in transformation,
flying to pay homage in the Supreme Clarity.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!"*

Recite this nine times, inhale the northern qi, and exhale it into the water.

Recite the incantation again:
*"Red apricot in *mao*, ink-black in *kan*,
grind true *you*, stocking *la* in the south.
Numinous Treasure.
Middle finger, center.
*Xing* arises in *qian*, *du* stands alone in *kun*, *ke* and *han* in *xun*.
Reverently invite the Perfected of the Great One of Heaven,
the Perfected of the Great Beginning of Heaven,
the True Immortals and True Perfected,
to ascend in response to the position of *Qian*,
the Six Dings as left spirits,
the Six Jias as right troops,
to receive for me the divine incantation of the Heavenly Heart and Great One.
The fire wheel of the south dispels evil and removes illness.
Charge and command with the *Geng* water.
The secret name of the Great One."*

Recite this incantation ten times, inhale the northern *qi*, and exhale it into the water.

While reciting, visualize the sun as a great wheel of fire within the water. Inhale *qi* and project it into the seal, then perform the Mudra of the Five Peaks and Three Paths with both hands. Recite again:

*"Though this disciple receives *qi* but thrice in a year,
heavenly *qi*, earthly *qi*,
solar *qi*, lunar *qi*,
the *qi* of the Five Stars,
the *qi* of the Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper,
the *qi* of the Six Dings and Six Jias,
the *qi* of the Nine Sovereigns of the Northern Dipper,
the *qi* of the Three Terraces and Canopy of Hua,
the *qi* of the Primordial Three Heavens above,
the wondrous *qi* that sustains the Five Peaks,
the *qi* of wind and clouds,
the *qi* of thunder and rain,
the *qi* of the Four Uprights.
Heaven cannot cover me,
earth cannot bear me.
Whoever opposes me shall perish,
whoever strikes me shall die.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!"*

Recite the incantation three times, inhale the northern *qi*, and blow it into the water. Then face north, recite the incantation once more, and draw the *qi* of the five directions into the mouth, rinsing and swallowing it into the abdomen. Take three sips of the water, pressing down the true *qi*, and flick the Mudra upon the body.

Then offer nine bows with incense and withdraw.

*The Great Method of the Numinous Treasure Scripture of Limitless Salvation, Scroll Nine*
*The Great Method of the Numinous Treasure Scripture of Limitless Salvation, Scroll Ten*
*Chapter on Penetrating Vision and Summoning*

The descent of Perfected Ones and the summoning of spirits in the *Numinous Treasure* tradition arise from the *qi* of the Three Caverns in flight and mystery, naturally coalescing into sacred talismans to invoke the hosts of the Three Origins, the myriad spirits, and the thousand Perfected. Should the adept hold office in the True Rank of the Azure Palace, among the transcendent ranks of the Numinous Void, and wish to summon the thousand Perfected and command the hundred spirits, take azure silk seven feet and two inches in length, sever it at the center, and inscribe upon it the Vermilion Talisman for the Descent of Perfected Ones and the Yellow Seal-Script Talisman for the Summoning of Spirits. Place them within the oratory. Use a mat of yellow brocade, or silk if brocade is unavailable.

Perform the *jiao* rites to offer sacrifice. Every nine days, invoke the inner taboo names of the Five Emperors, visualizing the talismans within the palm. After nine offerings, the true *qi* coalesces into radiance within the palm. After a hundred days, the envoys for the descent of Perfected Ones and the summoning of spirits—three Jade Maidens and three Golden Lads—will descend alongside the rites, directly guarding the numinous script and ensuring the swift arrival of the summoned Perfected Ones into the chamber. Thus may one behold the Heavenly Perfected with the eyes and hear the numinous sounds with the ears. After three offerings, their forms may be faintly perceived. Should the adept’s faith lack sincerity, the Five Peaks will test them. To lightly disclose these secrets will render the summoned spirits unresponsive. All the Perfected and Transcendents of the heavens heed the numinous talismans to appear before the adept. Without these sacred writs, any summoning is false. Though one may exhaust the mind in earnest devotion, no response will be granted. Should any entity descend, it is likely a demonic trial. The recipient must adhere to the statutes of the Mysterious Capital, presenting three plain silks measured by the year’s length to the scripture master, memorizing them in the void of the mind without committing them to writing, lest gods, spirits, birds, or beasts steal a glimpse and leak these profound mysteries.

**Vacuous Sovereign Talisman for the Descent of Perfected Ones**
**Vacuous Sovereign Talisman for the Summoning of Spirits**

The adept must submit a memorial to the Primordial August True King, swearing an oath to request the descent of these two talismans, for they are the pivotal essence of the *Numinous Treasure* tradition. When employing these grand methods to benefit the primordial and commune with the divine, purify the left hand, ensuring it is free from all defilement. Form the Mudra of the Five Peaks, draw the *qi* of the five directions, and blow it into the left hand, allowing pure boys, pure girls, good men, and good women to also blow *qi* into the hand. Perform three blows and three presses; if the left hand appears azure or verdant, one may enter the sacred realm. Other hues are unsuitable for entry.

The True Taboo Names and Incantation of the Five Peaks:
*"Hongxing, Mohei, Mozhen, Walà, Lingbao."*
Recite the incantation once, draw the *qi* of the five directions, and blow it onto the mudra, keeping the hand seal unbroken. With the right hand, use two fingers to inscribe the Summoning Talisman for Perfected Ones in the air. Inhale and blow into the left hand, recite the incantation five times, draw the *qi* of the five directions, and blow it toward the altar, instructing adults and children to fix their gaze and observe the adept’s right hand, then have them all blow *qi*. Recite the incantation again, draw the *qi* of the five directions, swallow it, and press it down. Then bid the observers open their eyes and look into their own palms; if a verdant hue like the azure heavens appears, the rite may proceed. If not, repeat the procedure among the assembly. Select those who perceive it clearly and in accordance with the method. Once the verdant hue is seen, recite the incantation:
*"Reverently invite the envoys of the Vacuous Sovereign’s Talismans for the Descent of Perfected Ones and the Summoning of Spirits to swiftly bear the talismans and manifest their forms. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the *Numinous Treasure* statutes!"*
Draw the *qi* of the southeast and blow it into the left hand. Have the observers blow three times. Recite the incantation again, perform three blows and three presses, and bid the observers look again. They will then see two crimson segments on the palm. Invoke the talismans again and blow *qi*; the leftward script of the Descent Talisman and the rightward seal-script of the Summoning Talisman will become distinct. Only then summon the officials of the *Numinous Treasure* to behold the talismans. Once they are clearly seen, instruct the chosen person to fix their gaze upon the officials without blinking. The master should then withdraw the hand, dismissing the officials, who will move to and fro in the void of the Mystery, revealing their true forms. This is the secret method of the *Numinous Treasure* for benefiting the primordial and communing with the divine to enter the sacred realm. It is not recorded in writing but transmitted orally and memorized in the heart; guard it with utmost secrecy.

**Summoning and Descending Perfected Spirits into the Ritual Space**
First, burn incense and wash the hands. Once done, recite the inner taboo names of the Five Peaks and sit in repose. Next, with the right hand, inscribe this vertical flourish upon the altar. Then gather the flourish into the hand, form the Mudra of the Five Peaks in rotation, recite the taboo names of the Five Peaks, and blow the *qi* of the five directions into the hand three times. Again, inscribe the *Taiqing* flourish upon the altar, gather it into the left hand, rotate the Mudra of the Five Peaks, recite the inner taboo names of the Five Peaks, and blow *qi* into the hand. Repeat this three times. Then observe the hand for a verdant hue; if it is not yet verdant, recite the taboo names of the Five Peaks again, draw the *qi* of the five directions, and blow it until the hand appears as azure as the heavens, then cease. Next, invoke the envoys of the Descent and Summoning Talismans:
*"Reverently invite the envoys of the Primordial August’s Descent Talisman and the Jade Emperor’s Summoning Talisman to descend swiftly."*
Draw the *qi* of the northwest and blow it onto the verdant *qi* of the left hand; crimson light will appear on both sides. If not yet visible, invoke the envoys of the Descent and Summoning Talismans again until the crimson hue appears. Then observe the left and right edges of the palm for two talismanic scripts: one vertical seal-script, one horizontal seal-script. If they are not distinct, recite the invocation for the Descent and Summoning Talismans again until they become clear. Then recite the *Numinous Treasure* Incantation for the Gathering of Numinous Winds and Mists:
*"Jade tones gather *qi*, numinous winds assemble mists.
Purple voids luxuriate, aiding the myriad Transcendents.
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions, naturally perfected."*
Draw the *qi* of the southeast and blow it; the talismans will stir in unison. If they do not move, recite the incantation and blow again, then summon the youths of the five directions. Recite the incantation:
*"Reverently invite the Azure Numinous Primordial Elder and the Youth Who Initiates the Dao of the East to descend swiftly and manifest their forms. By imperial command, descend swiftly to me; swiftly blow the *qi* of the East!"*
*"Reverently invite the Cinnabar Numinous True Elder and the Youth Who Initiates the Dao of the South to descend swiftly and manifest their forms. By imperial command, descend swiftly to me; swiftly blow the *qi* of the South!"*
*"Reverently invite the Radiant Numinous Yellow Elder and the Youth Who Initiates the Dao of the West to descend swiftly and manifest their forms. By imperial command, descend swiftly to me; swiftly blow the *qi* of the West!"*
*"Reverently invite the Fivefold Numinous Mysterious Elder and the Youth Who Initiates the Dao of the North to descend swiftly and manifest their forms. By imperial command, descend swiftly to me; swiftly blow the *qi* of the North!"*
*"Reverently invite the Yellow Numinous Verdant Elder and the Youth Who Initiates the Dao of the Center to descend swiftly and manifest their forms. By imperial command, descend swiftly to me; swiftly blow the *qi* of the Above!"*
Once one direction’s envoy is seen, summon the next without overlap or simultaneous invocation. After blowing *qi*, if the shadow is distinct, recite the incantation and blow upon the clothing to clarify the vision.

Then examine their countenances closely, taking care not to mistake one for another, and proceed with meticulous attention. Once the Youth has manifested, summon the Six Ding Jade Maidens, reciting the *Tongguang Daming* Divine Incantation to invoke the Six Ding and Six Jia Jade Maidens to appear "in adult form." Fix your gaze single-mindedly upon the Jade Maidens’ forms.

The master withdraws his hands into his sleeves and recites the *Tongguang Daming* Divine Incantation:
*"Red apricot, Mao script; ink-black, Kan script; grinding true, Dui script; stocking-wax, Gao script; Numinous Treasure, central finger’s central script. Flourishing life turns to Yin script; solitary servant shifts to Mao script; Ke Han illuminates Chen script; merit complete in Si script; sharp corner corrects Wu atop, then moves to the central finger’s central script—insert firmly, gather souls and seize."*

With the right hand, form the mudra in sequence with the left, reciting the incantation as the mudra is made. Draw the *qi* of the Three Paths of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, and blow it into the mirror. Recite the incantation again:
*"Merit gathers souls, summoning the swift messengers of the Eight Directions, celestial deities and earthly spirits, the myriad numina united as one by the Celestial Emperor’s decree. United Bright Celestial Emperor, Sun; United Bright Celestial Emperor, Sun. Swiftly reveal, swiftly reveal! □li □li, embed and fall, embed and fall! Embed and fall, swiftly come, swiftly come!"*

Draw the *qi* of the Eight Directions, blow it upon the mirror with the mudra, and summon the Six Ding and Six Jia Jade Maidens to swiftly manifest within the mirror. The incantation reads:
*"Reverently invite the Left-Flying Right-Numinous: Jiazi Jade Maiden, Jiaxu Jade Maiden, Jiashen Jade Maiden, Jiawu Jade Maiden, Jiachen Jade Maiden, Jiayin Jade Maiden; Dingchou Jade Maiden, Dinghai Jade Maiden, Dingyou Jade Maiden, Dingwei Jade Maiden, Dingsi Jade Maiden, Dingmao Jade Maiden."*

Draw the *qi* of the Five Directions and blow it forth; first the *qi* appears, then the form and shadow, the depth of clothing, and finally the face. If the vision remains indistinct, recite the summoning incantation again and draw *qi* to blow upon it. Only when all this is complete may other immortals and perfected beings be summoned. If the sequence is not followed, the invocation will fail, or if it succeeds, it will be with great difficulty. These Five Emperors, Six Ding, and Six Jia are the ancestors of the myriad *qi*, and thus they are summoned first.

**Summoning the Immortals of the Azure Mystery Palace into the Array**
Reverently invite the Most Compassionate One, the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from Suffering, who responds to cries and hastens to aid, dwelling in the Hall of Eternal Joy within the Eastern Ultimate Palace. Implore the descent of true *qi* to assist the adept’s vision. Draw the *qi* of the East and blow it forth. Recite the incantation:
*"Reverently invite the Numinous Response Perfected Youth of the Azure Mystery, who ascends and descends with the primordial destiny. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Heavenly Worthy of the Azure Mystery!"*

Draw the *qi* of the West from the Palace of Great Yin and blow it forth. Once your hand glows with the brightness of the moon, you may summon the Jade Lads, Jade Maidens, *lingguan* officials, and *gongcao* messengers to observe.

**Summoning the Immortals of the Palace of Great Yang into the Array**
Recite: *"The Celestial Emperor of Great Yang descends. Sun Sovereign Incantation."*

Draw the *qi* of the South and blow it forth. Upon completing the incantation, trace a circle, visualize the sun, recite the spell, and blow the *qi* into your hand. Wait until the light appears like the sun before ceasing. If no manifestation is seen, repeat the incantation until the light appears. Draw the *qi* of the South and blow it again; once the light brightens, summon the Jade Lads, Jade Maidens, and immortal hosts, who will manifest first as *qi*, then as shadows, followed by their clothing and countenance.

**Summoning the Immortals of the Seven Stars Palace into the Array**
Reverently invite □□□□□□□, the Numinous Lad of the Northern Dipper, whose single call elicits a hundred responses. *Mao* aligns with *Dui*, *Xu* with *Chen*, elevated in *Kun*.

Flick the Dipper upon the mirror, draw the *qi* of the North, and blow it forth. Cease only when the Seven Stars manifest. If they do not appear, recite the incantation and blow again until they are seen. Should even one star be absent, divine only one matter of fortune or misfortune. If the patient’s life-star is unseen, it portends great ill. Only when all seven stars are present may the celestial generals and officials of the Northern Dipper be summoned, who will first appear as *qi*, then as shadows, followed by their clothing and countenance.

**Summoning the Immortals of the Transmutative Quiescence Palace into the Array**
First recite the taboo names of the Five Emperors, summon the Jade Lads of the Four Directions, and the Six Dings and Six Jias. Then recite the Transmutative Quiescence Incantation:

*"Within the cavern’s profound void, the vast origin shines resplendent.
The mighty spirits of the eight directions render me naturally empowered.
By the talisman and mandate of the Numinous Treasure, I proclaim to the Nine Heavens.
Qianluo Danna, the Dipper’s might pervades the Great Mystery.

Marching through the Five Peaks, the Eight Seas heed my call.
The Demon Kings bow their heads, guarding my hall.
Banish defilement, let the Dao’s *qi* endure eternally.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes and ordinances!"*

Draw the *qi* of the North and blow it forth. Immediately, towers, terraces, palaces, and halls will appear. First, *qi* manifests, then form and shadow, after which you may summon the Jade Lads, Jade Maidens, officials, and lords of the Divine Empyrean Jade Palace’s immortal hosts.

**Incantation for Summoning the Immortals of the Capital of Numinous Descent**
*"The celestial script spreads wide, gazing down upon the Grand Tenuity.

Eight luminaries encircle six circuits, upheld by the Yellow Cycle’s sway.
I now make my great vow, unlocking heaven’s mechanism.

For any summoning of the Jade Palace’s immortals, Jade Lads, Jade Maidens, generals, officials, or *gongcao* messengers, first offer incense thrice, recite the incantation three times, then proceed with the specific summoning incantation. From the Attendant of the Golden Portals to the True Lords of the Three Origins, to the Right Hall’s generals, summon them according to their respective offices and inquire of them.

Knock your teeth together three or four times, burn the talisman of the summoned immortal before the incense burner, and form the Jade Clarity mudra with both hands.

After a ninety-day retreat, summon and descend the immortal spirits to the Jade Clarity Bureau, using the southeastern qi.
When the numinous spirits descend, one may vaguely sense their presence.
First, one sees qi; then shadows; then colors; then garments; then faces.
Following this, one perceives the Three Numinous Realms’ equilibrium; then mirrors; then scepters; then emptiness.
With each incantation, a golden and azure division splits apart.
If they are lost, they will not arrive; three losses result in permanent loss.
Those without golden bones and jade countenance must yearn for the Dao as a thirsty infant craves its mother’s milk, relinquish wealth as a hundred snakes shed their skin—
this must never be transmitted to those of superficial interest or the unlearned.
Thus concludes *The Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity, Scripture of the Upper Chapters*, Scroll Ten.
Here begins *The Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity, Scripture of the Upper Chapters*, Scroll Eleven.

**The Supreme Chapter on the Primal Jade Tablets**

The Perfected Sovereign says: The nine grades of texts from the Three Caverns of Supreme Purity are divided into four auxiliary sections. Only the *Jade Stairs of the Numinous Treasure* retains the residual divine chapters, which prioritize the salvation of the dead and the deliverance of the living. Those in the Lower Realm who study the true Way often begin with diligence but end in laxity, for their dust-bound roots obscure their understanding. The six wisdoms remain unopened, and they are deluded by the six heavens’ demons. The four perverse influences arise wantonly, manifesting in all manner of transformations, yet they cannot achieve penetrating clarity. Thus, among the texts of the Three Caverns, the highest is called *Cavern of Perfection*. For the ordinary practitioner, the Cavern of Perfection unites form and spirit, allowing the eyes to behold the Perfected Ones, merging with the Dao in perfect accord. As for the middle and lower caverns—*Cavern of Mystery* and *Cavern of Divinity*—they are the origin of the ten thousand methods and the root of the six penetrations. Therefore, the Heavenly Worthy verifies the Dao with the *Eye of Wisdom* and the *Eye of Truth*, while the Perfected Ones stabilize the *Dharma Eye* and the *Eye of Compassion*. Radiating their gaze across the Three Realms, they perceive all as if held in the palm of their hand. The celestial Perfected command the methods, having first illuminated inner vision; externally, they cultivate cavernous vision to manifest the eye of Dao-wisdom. With cavernous sight, penetrating vision, and distant observation, they embody the compassionate gaze of the Dharma—this is called the Three Caverns. In studying the *Cavern of Perfection*, one must first perceive the Perfected Ones with cavernous sight before attaining perfection. As for the *Cavern of Divinity*, one must behold the divine Perfected with the eyes before achieving communion with the divine and becoming a spirit-immortal.

Among the ten thousand methods of the Three Caverns, none do not first require the Three Caverns to be self-illuminated before one may commune with the divine and invite the descent of numinous spirits. As for the *Cavern of Divinity*, *Cavern of Depth*, *Cavern of Numinosity*, *Great Cavern*, the eight scribes, the six ding-spirits, the six jia-spirits of *Numinous Flight*, and *Luminous Cavern Vision*—all establish the Way of penetrating sight. If male practitioners indulge in lust or female practitioners succumb to perversity, their six roots remain impure, depleting and losing their true primal qi. How then can they achieve cavernous sight of the true or the divine? Those of pure yang will not conceal the spirit-immortals, while those of pure yin will manifest ghosts and spirits.

This is the secret transmission of the *Jade Tablet* from the Primal Perfected Ancestor. When the ancestor of the Three Caverns cultivates it, after a hundred days, they attain communion with the divine and the numinous; after a thousand days, the true immortals manifest their traces. Seeing them, one may command their service and summon the celestial Perfected. When merit is complete and virtue aligns, one ascends in broad daylight. In summoning the Perfected and observing the divine through the Three Caverns, without this *Jade Tablet*, all efforts are in vain, and one will never achieve penetrating clarity. It was never transmitted to the lower world. Yet with the spread of the Numinous Treasure teachings, demonic and perverse influences emerged from the shadows, and by means of this cavernous vision, they could no longer conceal their forms or escape delusion.

The *Jade Tablet* of the Daoist contains the hidden names of the highest Perfected. When used according to the method, one attains perfection in a set number of days. The recipient must choose a day of the Three Primes, the eight nodes, or the ten auspicious days, presenting two jade tablets, nine taels of gold, a thousand feet of white silk, and a sincerity offering of one hundred twenty strings of cash to swear the oath before the Three Officials and receive it from the master. If one fails to uphold the oath and recklessly divulges the celestial treasure, the master will suffer the trial of the wind-blade. If the disciple cultivates it without success, their lifespan will be reduced by a hundred and twenty years.

Those who dwell in cold hermitages must discern the right person and not be swayed by greed. To leak this is contrary to the Dao, and the penalty is the same. The *Five Precepts of Cavernous Vision in the Numinous Treasure*:

The Three Caverns, four auxiliaries, hundreds of thousands of scrolls, scriptures of the Dao and the divine—countless millions of characters—all take cavernous vision as their foundation. In the highest, the *Cavern of Perfection* descends the true, and one becomes Perfected. In the middle, the *Cavern of Mystery* descends the mysterious, and one becomes an immortal. In the lowest, the *Cavern of Divinity* descends the divine, and one attains the Dao. In cultivating the Way of cavernous vision, one must first clarify the Five Precepts:

1. **Fasting and single-minded devotion**: When the spirit descends into the body, if one is not fasting and single-minded, one will incur divine retribution.
2. **Purity of body and mind**: With purity of body and mind, the spirit’s light achieves penetrating vision. Without purity, defiled qi will assail and cloud the spirit’s radiance.
3. **Consistency from beginning to end**: Maintaining consistency ensures the swift manifestation of spiritual efficacy. Without it, wondrous responses will be difficult to achieve.
4. **Serenity of spirit and harmony of qi**: When spirit is serene and qi harmonious, one summons the true and meets the numinous. Without serenity, anger drives the spirit far away.
5. **Secrecy in cultivation**: Never leak the hidden mechanisms. To do so invites divine censure.

In practicing this method, one must strictly adhere to the Five Precepts. Additionally, one should choose the days before or after the winter solstice—*wuchen*, *wuxu*, *jiazi*, or *jiawu*—to commence cavernous vision. Without following the proper form, cavernous vision will be difficult to achieve. One must be sincere, upright, and pure in body and mind, abstaining from meat, impurity, intoxication, and lust. Only then may one proceed, first swallowing the talismanic tablets. When true qi enters the body, it washes away the mundane defilements, refining yin into yang, and the true immortals will manifest without concealment.

For this method: nine for wood, three for fire, five for earth, seven for metal, and one for water. Draw each through the nose, revolve it in the mouth, and send it with qi. Recite again:
*"The Nine Luminaries move in order; the Primordial Beginning lingers.
Their radiant essence gleams; the primordial numen scatters.
Gazing endlessly, their light descends upon me.
Ascending to the crimson splendor, it dissolves stagnation and opens the heart.
Riding the flying clouds, the body soars to the Purple Tenuity.
All matters under heaven are known to me first.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!"*

This method: draw through the nose as before, swallow according to the mouth-count—wood enters the liver, fire enters the heart, metal enters the lungs, water enters the kidneys, and earth enters the spleen.

This method requires swallowing the Six Jia talismans at dawn, then proceeding to their respective directions—within sixty paces, beyond ten. Gather wood from the corresponding direction, whether trunk or branch. With the right hand, grasp the wood; with the left, break off half, leaving the other half on the ground. Clasp the fallen grass in the left hand’s middle knuckle. Avoid contact with women, entering chambers, or the western direction. Visualize the Jia spirit-general and jade maiden standing before you.

Recite the incantation:
*Six Jia, nine configurations,
Heaven round, earth square.
Four directions, five phases—
Azure, crimson, white, yellow.
Grand Unity as master,
Sun and moon as light.
Yu governs the Dao,
Chiyou repels weapons.

White Tiger guards the rear.

Dispelling inauspicious omens.
Northern Dipper executes judgment,
Eradicating misfortune and calamity.
Five spirits guide me,
Roaming the eight directions.
Penetrating vision unobstructed,
Piercing sight in all quarters.
Those who oppose me perish,
Those who turn from me die.
Those who hate me
Shall suffer their own retribution.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with statutes and ordinances!*

For the right (western) direction, draw qi through the nose into the kidneys. By day, visualize it emerging to follow the *wei* (defensive qi); by night, visualize it entering the kidneys. Change once every ten-day cycle, following the six Jia as in spring.

Recite the incantation:
*In spring, the Jia resides in heaven,
Above corresponding to celestial mystery.
Light and pure, it attaches to qi,
Yellow Dao, golden origin.
In summer, the Jia resides in the Tiger,
Scattering to fill the Astral Tower.
Numinous chart, great edifice,
Power of the eight directions.
In autumn, the Jia resides on earth,
Below corresponding to the nine springs.
Qi of generation and completion,
Assisting my three fields.
In winter, the Jia resides in yang,
Qi filling the Dipper and Ox.
Circumpolar constellations,
Aiding my field and sprouts.*

For the six Jia days at dawn, face the Jia direction. First form the Five Peaks mudra, recite the *Kuigang*, *Zheyuan*, and *Tianzhen* incantations three times. Then, according to the Jia direction, inhale qi once, swish it in the mouth, and swallow thirty-six times, dividing it into three gulps to reach the cinnabar field. Next, click the teeth thirty-six times, sit facing the Jia direction, fully extend both legs and arms, then clasp the hands and place them on the head, straightening the arms. Perform the crane’s peck three times, sway the two passes eighteen times. Evenly distribute the "water" atop the head, as if drawing in waves, guiding it down to below the navel. Swallow qi once, then place the talisman on the tongue, recite the incantation as before, and swallow it with saliva. Cease thereafter.

After practicing:
- First Jia: metal essence solidifies.
- Second Jia: meridians flow freely.
- Third Jia: metal essence congeals like red jade.
- Fourth Jia: all spirits guard steadfastly.
- Fifth Jia: five spirits protect.
- Sixth Jia: cinnabar field crystallizes into treasure.
Only then may one rise from seclusion. If one violates desires and cravings, all prior efforts are instantly forfeited.

On the six Ding days at dawn, swallow the talisman, recite the incantation, draw qi from the corresponding direction, and blow it onto the body. Proceed in that direction, walking within sixty steps but beyond twelve. With the left hand, take a blade of grass; with the right, break it. Do not look back. Return to the chamber, place the grass in the corresponding direction, and visualize the Jade Maiden’s form. Offer incense.

Recite the prayer:
*Reverently, precious incense,
Ascends to the six Ding.
The former master made a pact,
Granting me this divine method.
I bow and offer fine incense,
Deer jerky, honeyed broth.

Heaven’s green ants, fragrant matured nectar.
Butter cakes, pure fruits,
Luminous lamps and candles.
With equal devotion, I kowtow,
Summoning the divine kings.

Command bodies like vajra,
Prolong life and increase destiny,
Everlasting joy without end.

Attain great fortune and prosperity.

Flee to distant lands.

Cower and hide.

All affairs flourish.

No detail hidden.
Attuned to the numinous, attaining sagehood,
Ears keen, eyes bright.
Today I summon and invite,
Beseeching descending blessings.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with statutes and ordinances!*

For the method of drawing the six Ding directional qi: if it is Ding-mao, inhale nine breaths into the kidneys. At night, visualize them residing in the kidneys; by day, visualize them emerging to follow your movements. On the sixth night of each month, as before, recite the *Kuigang*, *Qianyuan*, and *Tianzhen* incantations three times, then recite the Five Peaks incantation over cinnabar, and blow onto paper inscribed with the six Ding taboo names. Cut it into three segments: swallow the first two characters in the first ten-day period, the middle two in the second, and the last two in the third. On the sixth day, place them by the bedside along with the consecrated water. At the fifth watch, rise, dress, sit facing the Ding direction of the ten-day period, take the first two characters, and swallow them with water. Recite the taboo name repeatedly until someone passes outside the door. Upon hearing their footsteps, cough, then face the direction of the sound, inhale their qi, and swallow it. Visualize the two Ding entering the heart. Proceed similarly on the twelfth and eighteenth days until all three periods are complete.

For submitting petitions, making requests, dispelling evil, or healing afflictions: light incense, place the written petition before you, face the Ding direction, recite the taboo name, inhale qi, and draw in the petition. Recite the taboo name again, inhale qi, and blow it onto the petitioner. Recite the taboo name once more, inhale qi, and swallow it. Visualize the six Ding spirits in the heart. Inhale a breath of the petitioner’s qi, store it in the heart, calm the spirit, and quiet the mind. After a long while, when a thought arises in the heart, discern whether the afflicting demon exists, its number, and the illness’s condition—all will be precisely revealed. Do not entertain stray or impure thoughts, nor a second notion, or the insight will fail. If doubt or hesitation arises, the revelation will be neither accurate nor true. Beware, beware!

In spring and summer, step from *Kui* to *Ao*; in autumn and winter, step from *Dou* to *Piao*. Offer incense, bow three times toward the Heavenly Gate, and silently present a memorial, burning it in the incense burner. Bow again, form the Jade Purity mudra with both hands, face north, and consecrate the water. Proceed as before.

**Silent Memorial**
*Great Ming, [Year], [Month], [Day],
Your subject [Name], kowtows and bows twice to memorialize.
I humbly reflect: born in the lower realm, I traverse the dusty world. By past karmic fortune, I bear the registers of this method. I have presumptuously received the profound grace of the Great Dao, overstepping to serve in the Three Caverns’ pure office. My original vow is to assist Heaven’s transformations and aid the nation to save the people. I swear to pray for blessings, repent for transgressions, dispel calamities, deliver the living and the dead, and eradicate evil to establish righteousness. This sincere resolve shall never waver.*

**Memorial of Gratitude and Supplication**

I, your subject, prostrate myself in profound gratitude, yet deeply reflect: though I sincerely uphold Heaven’s decrees, my intentions often stray from the true principle, failing to penetrate the subtle and profound or manifest divine responsiveness. This arises from my impure mortal form—a being of flesh and blood—how could I fully perceive the celestial realms, let alone clearly behold spirits and gods? Rarely do I turn demons toward rectitude, seldom do my deeds benefit others. My eyes are as though blind, my ears as though deaf.

Formerly, I received from my masters the transmission of the Primal Jade Tablet of the Hunyuan, the Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns, the esoteric names of the sagely perfected, and the divine scriptures of penetrating insight, which I was commanded to uphold. Today, I have chosen an auspicious day to henceforth maintain perpetual abstinence, ingesting these texts in accordance with the method. Within, I purify the filth of the heart; without, I refine the essence of the eyes. Thus may I clearly perceive the Three Realms and pierce the vision of spirits and gods.

I humbly beseech the Ancestral Master, the Root Master, the Perfected Master, the Most August Supreme Emperor, and the True Sages of the Three Treasures beneath Your Jade Majesty: deign not to regard my presumption, but bestow upon me Heaven’s grace. May You specially descend the vital *qi* of true purity, the luminous wisdom of the Great Dao, the blessings of the Three Treasures, and the wondrous transformative radiance of the six divine penetrations into my body. Within, dispel the dust and obstructions of the heart’s realm; without, remove the defilement clouding my eyes. Refine and dissolve the yin obscurations of the hundred spirits, illumine the viscera and bowels, absolve karmic hindrances and calamities, and sever the knotted roots of the womb’s origin. Subdue demonic trials, and may the myriad perfected ones lend their accord.

After ingesting the esoteric names, seated, I shall observe the Three Realms; standing, I shall illuminate the ten directions. I shall clearly behold the immortals and perfected, distinctly perceive spirits and gods, foreknow incipient signs, and lucidly discern celestial patterns. Forever shall I escape the eight difficulties and three disasters, resolve the thousand misfortunes and nine calamities, and wherever I turn, encounter auspiciousness. My vows shall be proclaimed and transmitted, the Great Dao shall flourish, and all beings shall turn toward faith.

I vow that life after life, I shall deliver the living and liberate the dead, subdue demons and evil. Through ten thousand kalpas and a thousand aeons, I shall remain a disciple of the Three Treasures. Should I receive the response of the mysterious radiance, I shall never dare to reveal even a word or half a phrase of Heaven’s secrets.

With reverence, I prostrate myself and present this memorial of my heart, ascending through the Three Heavenly Gates. May it follow the incense smoke to be conveyed and memorialized before the Most August Supreme Emperor of the Great Dao and the Three Treasures.

I, your subject, can scarcely contain my fervent prayers and yearning for grace. Overwhelmed with awe, I kowtow twice in supplication.

**Incense Prayer**

On this [Year], [Month], [Day], I, [Name], holding the dharma rank, make my plea to Heaven. With utmost reverence, I invoke and beseech:

The Three Clarities and Supreme Sages,
The Jade Emperor of Heaven,
The Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity,
The Sun, Moon, and Five Planets,
The Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper,
The Three Terraces and celestial stars,
The Perfected Ones of the Three Heavens,
The Four Sagely Marshals,
The Five Emperors of the Five Peaks,
The Seven Celestial Consorts,
The Venerable Elder of Southern Prosperity,
The Divine Lords of the Six Dings,
The Divine Lords of the Six Jias,
The Thunder Gods and Rain Deities,
The Divine Tiger and Great Sage Envoys,
The Four Upright Merit Officers,
The Four Upright Divine Generals,
The Divine Generals of Penetrating Vision,
The Youths of Clarity and Insight.

Today, I strictly adhere to the *Lingbao* Great Method and the Primal Jade Tablet of the Hunyuan, the Hidden Writ of the Highest Clarity.

On each day of the Six Jia, swallow the inner secret names of the Highest Perfected Ones, the hidden jade characters. Through fasting and ingestion, one petitions the divine Perfected Ones of penetrating vision and all-seeing insight, commanding immortals and spirits, summoning souls and seizing spirits. Humbly beseeching the sagely compassion not to fault this transgression of recitation, permit the consumption of the secret names and jade talismans.

Today, encountering the day of Jiazi, I reverently ingest the inner secret names of the Highest Perfected Ones, bestowed with the Dao-black dharma eye, seeing through the hundred spirits and commanding the thousand Perfected Ones. To the left, I summon the Six Jia; to the right, I invoke the Six Ding. Seated, I conjure traveling kitchens and foreknow the yet-to-be. My body generates water and fire, transforming without limit.

I cannot fully express my prayers to Heaven, my longing for the sagely presence.

The ritual concludes with repeated bows.

**Six Ding Formula**
The inner Six Ding formula states: On a Six Ding day at noon, write in cinnabar script the true secret names of the Six Ding on yellow silk. From the original six-character secret name, form talismans with every two characters. Face the direction of the current旬 as the head, following in sequence. Inhale qi and distribute it to form three talismans. On the seventh day of this night, at the hour of Chou (1–3 a.m.), don robes, face the Ding direction, take one talisman, hold it roundly, recite its name, and swallow it with water. When someone first makes a sound at the appointed time, swiftly and urgently face the direction, inhale qi six times, and swallow it, repeating seven times in the middle. After seven days, the merit is equal, and three旬 suffice.

For any matter, face the direction, recite the name, inhale qi and swallow it, close the eyes briefly, and the spirit will reveal the intent in the heart. All petitions will pertain to future events, each one manifesting as predicted.

**Six Jia Formula**
The outer Six Jia formula states: On a Six Jia day at dawn, write the names of the Six Jia in cinnabar on white silk. Face the direction and swallow with westward-flowing water, or water from a well unseen by the Three Luminaries. Once done, clench both fists, sit upright, and strike the heavenly drum thirty-six times. Knock the teeth twenty-four times, interlock the hands, crane-peck six times, and rotate the two passes nine times. Part the hands to the top of the head, visualize the cinnabar field, where a radiant sun blazes, the entire body luminous as fire, internally and externally suffused with red.

Recite the name thirty-six times, inhale qi and blow it onto the body, constantly visualizing the six spirits attending. On the day the Six Jia cycle completes, future events will be revealed in dreams. The Six Jia will always attend the body, and with time, they may be seen and commanded at will.

For minor demonic disturbances, write in cinnabar, burn with gold coins, and the six generals will immediately dispatch the evil into the sea, with strange reports appearing in dreams.

**Six Ding Formula (for Exorcism)**
When encountering malevolent ghosts causing confusion, recite the formula once in the heart, close the eyes for a long moment, and the Six Ding will report to the heart’s spirit. The words arising in the mind will reveal the cause of the ghost’s calamity. Even details such as clothing colors and the number of people will match the verification.

**Merit Officers Formula**
For poisoning by toxic substances, abscesses, cinnabar tumors, or illnesses of the five viscera and six bowels, write the formula on the afflicted area, either ingesting or applying it externally. Recovery will occur within three repetitions.

**Three Heavens Secret Names Formula**
The comprehensive matching formula states: On the day before the year’s end, bathe and don clean clothes in advance. At dawn the following day, sit upright in a secluded chamber, face the heavenly gate, and recite the Three Heavens’ hidden secret names *Hong Dian* until twelve hours have passed, completing three hundred thousand repetitions. Remain silent for the entire following day. Thereafter, whenever reciting memorials or petitions, recite the method once, blow the eastern qi onto the text, and it will be conveyed. Responses will arrive promptly.

This method, when recited ten thousand times on the last day of the month, will instantly reach the Three Heavens, with responses descending directly to the mortal world.

**Three Heavens True Secret Names Formula**
The formula for rescue from peril states: On the eight seasonal nodes, fast and purify. At the transition between Xu and Hai (9–11 p.m.), enter stillness and sit, reciting the true secret names of the first heaven, *Fang Zhong Yuan Qiu De*, accumulating one hundred thousand repetitions. When encountering tigers, wolves, or poisonous creatures, hold the breath for seven cycles, recite thirty-two times, and all toxins will silently dissipate, unable to cause harm.

This method, when recited ten thousand times on the first day of the month, will manifest responses within three days, dispersing all calamities. Silently reciting thirty-two times will resolve disasters.

**Five Peaks Formula**
The Five Peaks body-preservation formula states: On the ninth day after the beginning of spring, the third day after the beginning of summer, the seventh day after the beginning of autumn, the fifth day after the beginning of winter, and the day after the earth’s vigor in each season, face the respective direction at the hours of Zi, Wu, Mao, You, Yin, Shen, Si, or Hai. Knock the teeth according to the number of the direction, visualize the Lord of the Eastern Peak leading the officials and clerks of the Four Peaks before you, grasp the Five Peaks formula, recite the secret names, inhale the qi of the five directions and swallow it. After a year’s practice is complete, when seeking matters, facing fear or urgent peril, meeting nobles, or traversing mountains and waters, first knock the teeth five times, recite the names, inhale the qi of the five directions and swallow it, then blow it onto the body and distribute it to the directions. Thus, peril will be averted, and all endeavors will be supremely auspicious and as wished.

**Five Peaks Three Paths Formula**
Left hand: Zhen (thunder), red apricot, Eastern Peak.
Middle finger: Li (fire), ink-black, Southern Peak.
Fourth finger: Dui (lake), grinding ink, Western Peak.
Middle finger root: Kan (water), wax, Northern Peak.
Middle finger center: central script, Lingbao, Central Peak.
Middle finger middle: Ke Han, Heavenly Path.
Kun script: Du Li, Earthly Path.
Xun script: Xing Sheng, Human Path.

The Five Peaks Three Paths seal: With the left and right hands, the three little fingers and fourth fingers face upward and interlock. Then, with the index fingers, hook the little fingers on the opposite sides. With the middle fingers of both hands, hook the fourth fingers of the opposite hands. Press the left and right middle fingers with the thumbs, each pressing the middle joint of the middle finger.

**Five Peaks Pacification Talisman**
The Five Peaks’ secret names pacify the five directions. The Human Path lies in the southeast, the Heavenly Path in the northwest, and the Earthly Path in the southwest. The general merit lies in the northeast. Write the complete talisman to subdue all inauspicious spirits, demons, and monsters, as well as temple altars, haunted grounds, water sprites, jiao dragons, and li serpents. Inscribe it on a large stone and sink it, or bury it. Within a hundred days, heavenly thunder will shatter it.

Inscribe the talisman in vermilion, perform the Five Peaks Three Paths mudra, and draw the qi of the Five Peaks Three Paths to blow upon it.

**Northern Dipper Talisman Mudra**
The *Dongming Wanhui Jue* states: On the fifth day of the fifth month, inscribe the Northern Dipper’s secret names in vermilion without counting their number. Seal them with red wax, place them in a green bamboo tube, and wrap them tightly with layers of paper. Conceal them in a chicken’s nest where a brooding hen sits, and retrieve them once the chicks hatch. Consuming one talisman enables recitation of ten thousand words, granting penetrating wisdom and divine communion—daily recitation of ten thousand words will never be forgotten.

For the method on the right: Inscribe on yellow silk, mix with yellow wax to form the Seven Primes, and consume one daily with pure water. After forty-nine days, wisdom will naturally illuminate, and recitation of ten thousand words will flow effortlessly.

**Southern Dipper Talisman**
For the method on the right: Inscribe in vermilion on yellow paper and ingest or wear it to cure all illnesses.

**Tools for Cultivating Penetrating Vision**
Yang-day Jade Characters
Yin-day Jade Characters

The Supreme One of Heavenly Perfection, the Supreme Simplicity of Heavenly Perfection, the Supreme Each of Heavenly Perfection. The Three Ones are named the Supreme Beginning of Heavenly Perfection, the Perfected Immortals and Perfected Persons. All the above are to be inscribed in vermilion on thin yellow paper and used according to yin and yang days. After twenty-one days, write upon a fragrant tablet and lick it with the tongue. After forty-nine days, inscribe within a porcelain vessel and wash with water to drink. After forty-nine days, add the names of the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors. After seventy-two days, incorporate them into the middle section of the Numinous Writ.

For all practices of penetrating vision, choose an auspicious day when the first yang arises before the winter solstice. First, prepare a memorial to the Celestial Court, the Sun and Moon, the Southern and Northern Dippers, the Five Palaces, and the Ancestral Masters. Submit a petition to the registers of the divine immortals within the method for their illumination and response. On the appointed day, follow the usual rites to pay homage to the Perfected, offer incense, and silently memorialize the practice of penetrating vision.

Upon completion, pace the Dipper’s seven stars. In spring and summer, begin with the right foot; in autumn and winter, begin with the left. Enter the Dipper’s mouth, bow three times, offer incense, and strike the ritual drum twenty-four times. Blow upon the incense burner, and silently present a memorial.

For the *Penetrating Vision Inscribed Jade Tablet*:
The practitioner burns incense and bows nine times, clicks the teeth thirty-two times, and summons the Three Qi. Visualize the body enveloped in clouds of three colors, both within and without resplendent. To the left, the Azure Dragon; to the right, the White Tiger; before, the Vermilion Bird; behind, the Dark Warrior. Lions and white cranes array to the left and right. The sun and moon illuminate brightly, the chamber radiant within. A circular image arises above the head, its light suffusing the ten directions.

The secret incantation states:
*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the left and right official messengers, the incense-attending Golden Lads, the message-transmitting Jade Maidens, the Five Thearchs’ direct talismans, and the incense officials of the day—thirty-two of each—forth. Let them emerge in solemn attire, adorned with caps and pendent tassels, their dignity arrayed. Station them to my left and right, before and behind, to convey my sincerity. Today, at this hour, I devote myself within the altar to the practice of penetrating vision, inscribing the jade tablet with celestial script. All secret intentions have been set forth in the silent memorial. I humbly beseech the Three and Five Merit Officers, the left and right official messengers, and all others to transmit my words directly to the august presence of the Three Treasures, the Most Honored before the Celestial Thearchs."*

Three times offer incense, three times bow, then rise and kneel to memorialize. State the practitioner’s name and dharma rank, prostrate in reverence, and with utmost awe, address the Jade Augustness of the Three Treasures Thearchs:

*"I, your humble servant, dwell in the lower realm yet have encountered this enlightened age, long bound to the true net by karmic affinity, personally receiving the transformation of the Dao. Through a thousand kalpas of fortunate convergence, I have been initiated into the registers of the method, presumptuously overseeing the Three Caverns and attaining the ranks of the Perfected. Now, by great fortune, I have encountered the practice of the Numinous Treasure Great Method. In such-and-such a year, so-and-so transmitted to me the *Hunyuan Jade Tablet*, the divine script of the Numinous Treasure’s penetrating vision, and the inner names of the numinous Perfected. Today, at this hour, I devote myself within the altar to the practice of penetrating vision, the method of descending Perfection and summoning the numinous, inscribing the inner names and true script. I humbly beseech the Ancestral Masters, the Three Treasures, and the Heavenly Thearchs not to deem me presumptuous..."*

May the celestial hearing not deem this a transgression. I humbly beseech the descent of the primordial true qi of life, the radiant light of the Great Dao’s wisdom, the grace of the Three Treasures, and the vast wisdom of the six penetrations, to flow into my body, purging the filth of my heart within and refining the clarity of my eyes without, that I may perceive the Three Realms with penetrating vision and behold the spirits and gods with unobstructed sight. Furthermore, I implore the issuance of a sacred decree to the divine bureaus and their subordinate offices—those of the penetrating vision script, the celestial courts, and all attendant hosts—to dispatch them into this altar, that I may forever serve as a disciple of the Three Treasures, universally delivering the hidden and the manifest, and fostering the transformations of life and creation.

From the moment I practice penetrating vision, I dare not violate the luminous statutes, nor lightly disclose or profane them. Should I transgress, I willingly submit to the celestial judgment. With these earnest entreaties, I respectfully present this oral memorial to the Great Dao, the Three Treasures, and the Jade Thearchs of the Imperial Heavenly Court. I prostrate myself before the celestial grace, awaiting the granting of my petition. Bowing deeply before the altar, I await the response with reverent trepidation.

Upon receiving the decree, I perform nine prostrations, rise, and form the Jade Thearch mudra with both hands. I then summon the three qi, inhaling thirty-two times through the nose, facing the Qian direction. With my eyes, I trace the True Form Talisman of the Three Heavens, drawing it into the Three Palaces, where it transforms into the Three Clarities, riding forth upon the three qi.

Next, I visualize my body transforming into the form of a divine lord: crowned with a golden-green cicada coronet, clad in a crimson rosy-feathered robe, a grand sash, vermilion shoes, and a deep-red skirt, seated amidst clouds of three hues. My left hand casts the Seven Dipper Seal of the Purple Tenuity, while my right hand forms the Three Fires, grasping the Jade Clarity mudra. I then recite the inner names of the Thirty-Two Heavenly Thearchs—from the Yellow Emperor of the Supreme August Jade Clarity Heaven, Yu Lan Yu Ming, to the Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate Pacifying Nurturing Heaven, Jia Yi—and select the dharma gate.

The Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Thearchs, extending to the Five Thearchs of the Three Realms, are all invoked in the Upper Clarity. *Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the ordinance of the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning and the statutes of the Most High Dao Lord.*

**Summoning the Celestial Courts Spell:**
*"Jade Clarity Treasury Bureau, governing all true numina.
Open the eyes and gaze, penetrating to behold spirits and gods.
Let the true numina descend, revealing their true forms.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes!"*

**Incense Offering and Summoning the Celestial Courts General Invocation:**
*"In the heavens most high..."*
*(Full incantation as found in the "Penetrating Vision, Descending Perfection, and Summoning the Numinous" section.)*

Next, with my eyes, I trace the True Talismans of the Three Heavens and Three Realms at the Gate of Heaven, visualizing them as three-colored radiance. I inhale the three qi through my mouth, allowing them to flow into the Three Palaces.

**The True Talismans of the Three Heavens and Three Realms:**
The Three Realms are the primordial true essence of the Three Qi, the wondrous qi of the numinous void, crystallized into true script at the dawn of the Three Heavens and Five Kalpas. They are the root and origin of the natural sounds of all heavens, never transmitted to the lower worlds. Yet, when imparted by the true ones through oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction, those who encounter this script are destined by past lives’ Dao bones. If one diligently practices it, they shall attain immortality. Should one maintain a prolonged fast in the purity of mountain forests or secluded halls, practice the truth of the Eight Wefts, cultivate the wonders of the Seven Classics, and ingest the true script, then within nine days, the Three Corpses shall perish of themselves, the qi of grain shall naturally cease, the body shall be at peace, the countenance shall glow with jade-like radiance, and the form shall gleam with golden luster—unlike the fleeting effects of medicinal stones or salivary qi, for this arises from the natural true qi. Through enduring practice, one shall attain longevity and transcend the world, forever free from decline and decay, and ultimately achieve immortality.

**Silent Incantation for Inscribing the Talisman:**
*"Numinous qi, divine qi, qi connecting to the Three Clarities.
Six Ding and Six Jia, the mighty sword is merciless.
The Nine Paths are natural, aiding and delivering all beings.
The celestial talisman is evenly inscribed, safeguarding peace and tranquility.
What demon would not submit? What ghost would not reveal its form?
Fire bells and celestial stems, the White Beast and Golden Essence.
Circulating in protection, fiercely guarding the Three Clarities.
By the talismanic command of the Celestial Thearch, the concealed essence is decreed.
Malevolent spirits perish, those of the Dao’s qi find peace.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes of the Three Realms of the Upper Clarity!"*

I then recite the preceding General Invocation once more, blowing the qi to the ten directions. Reciting it again, I gather the qi of the ten directions, blowing to the east, south, west, and north, and knock my teeth nine times.

**Penetrating Vision Celestial Courts Spell:**
*"Jade Clarity Treasury Bureau."*
*(Full incantation as previously recited, seven times.)*

I respectfully invoke the Celestial Worthy of Great Compassion and Salvation, the Most Exalted Great Director of Destinies of the Golden Watchtower, the Azure Lads of Azure Radiance, the Divine Lads of the Azure Mystery’s Numinous Response, the Divine Lord of Penetrating Vision of the Azure Empyrean, the Left Divine Tiger Penetrating Vision Great Spirit, the Right Divine Tiger Penetrating Vision Divine Lad, the Jade Maidens Receiving Decrees of the Ten Heavens, the Jade Maidens Receiving Decrees of the Three Heavens, the Numinous Officials Reporting to the Ten Heavens, the Numinous Officials Reporting to the Three Heavens, the Numinous Officials Reporting to the Five Thearchs, the Numinous Officials Reporting to the Great One, the Numinous Officials Reporting to the Grand Clarity, the Jade Maidens of Penetrating Vision, the Jade Maidens of Distant Vision, the Immortal Officials Governing Celestial Script Talismans, the Immortal Officials Governing Cloud Script Celestial Texts, and the Jade Maidens Discerning Demons.

I humbly beseech their united descent, bestowing the true qi to flow into my body, that I may inscribe the Jade Tablet and the penetrating vision script. Upon ingesting them, I shall instantly attain unobstructed vision of all numina and penetrating sight of the ten thousand directions, with all spirits vividly present before my eyes.

**Next, the □ Stem Incantation:**
*"The divine and sacred dharma of the Most High Lord Lao,
The sagely and efficacious dharma of the Mysterious Woman of the Nine Heavens.
□ Stem numinous, □ Stem sagely,
Encountering demonic spirits, swiftly act in accordance with the decree to subdue them!"*

Drawing the qi of the north, I blow it into the inkstone.

**Next, the Qian Yuan Incantation:**
*"Qian Yuan, origination, flourishing, advantage, and perseverance,
The sun and moon accompany me.
I am neither hungry nor thirsty,
Relying on the clarity of divine water.
Metal, wood, water, fire, earth,
The numbers of the Five Phases, the essence of the Six Jia.
The Three Qi of the Celestial Granary,
The turbid qi is ever full.
Yellow Father and Red Child,
Guard the center without inclining.
Divine water enters the Five Viscera,
Forever ensuring peace and tranquility.
Immortals together ascend in transformation,
Penetrating vision beholds the Upper Clarity.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes!"*

Drawing a breath, I exhale it into the inkstone.

Next, I visualize the fire wheel of the Great Yang within the water, arriving from the east and revolving within it, its brilliant radiance illuminating the entire chamber.

**The Great One Celestial Perfection Incantation:**
*"I respectfully invoke the Celestial Perfection of the Great One.
The Celestial Perfection of the Primordial Beginning,
True immortals and true perfected,
Corresponding above to the Qian position."*

The Six Ding auxiliary spirits, □□□□□□.
The Six Jia guardian generals, □□□□□□.
For me, ascend to receive the celestial mind,
Universally deliver all spirits.
The Great One’s divine incantation,
The fire wheel of the southern quarter.
Expel evil and heal illness,
Penetrating vision beholds the myriad spirits.
Empower the luminous water with command.

Drawing the southern qi, blow it into the water.
Next, recite the Heavenly Ford Incantation:
*"Heavenly Ford, Celestial Perfection,
Preserve the divine fluid, the spirit’s clarity.
One recitation severs ghosts,
Forever repelling demonic essence."*

Recite again:
*"The True Qi of the Celestial Stem,
Severs baleful influences and pestilential vapors.
The true Yang’s water,
Banishes them ten thousand leagues away."*

Drawing the northern qi, exhale it into the water.
Again offer incense, then with the middle finger,
grind the cinnabar in the vessel forty-nine turns to the left.
Recite:
*"Jiao, Kang, Di, Fang, Xin, Wei, Ji,
Dou, Niu, Nü, Xu, Wei, Shi, Bi,
Kui, Lou, Wei, Mao, Bi, Zi, Shen,
Jing, Gui, Liu, Xing, Zhang, Yi, Zhen.
□□□□□□□,
Tan, Ju, Lu, Wen, Lian, Wu, Po,
The Great Primordial’s true pivot, the net’s guiding cord."*

Drawing a breath of the Five Directions’ qi, blow it into the water.
With the left hand tracing the twelve branches,
and the right hand holding the brush,
recite:
*"Now this disciple, thrice yearly, receives the qi:
The celestial qi and the earthly qi,
The solar qi and the lunar qi,
The qi of the Five Stars,
The numinous qi of the Northern Dipper,
The life-generating qi of the Southern Dipper,
The yielding qi of the Six Ding,
The martial qi of the Six Jia,
The qi of wind and clouds,
The qi of thunder and rain,
The qi of the Four Upright,
The wondrous qi of the Five Peaks sustaining the body,
The Dao qi of the Three Heavens’ Three Treasures,
The divine tiger’s qi of the Northern Dipper.
Heaven cannot cover me,
Earth cannot bear me.
Those who strike against me die,
Those who collide with me perish."*

Swiftly command the gathering.

Set down the cinnabar brush and water. Next, with the left hand execute the Mudra of the Five Emperors, reciting the incantation in accord with the mudra:

*"Vermilion apricot, mao.
Ink-black, chou.
True grindstone, dui.
Stocking-skin, li.
Numinous Treasure, center of the middle finger.
Flourishing life turns to yin.
Solitary attendant shifts to mao.
Permitted Han, bright chen.
Meritorious capital completes at si."*

Precisely at noon, move the finger from the tip to the middle joint of the middle finger, then press firmly.

*"Gather the hun-souls, seize them."*

Next, draw the qi of the Three Paths of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, and blow it onto the paper and into the cinnabar brush. Recite again:

*"Meritorious capital gathers the hun-souls,
Summon the swift messengers of the Eight Directions,
Celestial spirits and earthly deities,
Myriad numina unite in return.
Conform to the Celestial Emperor’s decree.
Conform to the Radiant Celestial Emperor’s sun,
Conform to the Radiant Celestial Emperor’s sun.
Swiftly manifest, swiftly manifest.
□li □li, embed-fall embed-fall embed-fall,
Hasten here, hasten here, hasten here."*

Then draw a breath of the Eight Directions’ qi and blow it onto the paper, without releasing the mudra. With the right hand hold the brush to the mouth, three inches away, invoke the Three Qi in one breath, and blow it onto the brush. Inscribe the Jade Tablet and the Talisman for Summoning the Perfected and Calling the Numinous. Upon completion, offer incense again and report to the officials.

*The Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity, Upper Scripture, Scroll Thirteen Concludes.
The Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity, Upper Scripture, Scroll Fourteen.*

**The Rite of Penetrating Vision and Divine Perfection**

First offer incense, kindle the brazier, and visualize as prescribed. Assume the Mudra of the Supreme Emperor, invoking the Three Heavens Most High, the Primordial Three Qi of the Grand Supreme Elder Lord. Draw the mudra from within your body, shifting it to the root of the middle finger, then trace along the roots of the two adjacent fingers to their nails and press.

The Thirty-Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Messengers, the Left and Right Incense-Bearers, the Courier Dragon Riders, the Golden Lads Attending Incense, the Jade Maidens Scattering Flowers, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans, and the Incense Officials of the Day—thirty-six of each—emerge. Release the mudra, then resume the Mudra of the Supreme Emperor, pressing firmly with the middle finger.

Swiftly ascend the Pass and petition the Jade Emperor of the Three Heavens Most High, the Void and Spontaneous Perfected One. Now, as I enter the oratory to burn incense, at this very hour within the altar, I perform the rites of penetrating vision, summoning the Perfected and calling the Numinous. All secret intentions are set forth in the memorial.

May the upright qi of the Ten Directions’ Perfected Ones descend and flow into my body, that my petition may swiftly reach the presence of the Three Pure Ones of the Utmost True and Boundless Dao, the Jade Emperor of the August Heaven.

Again bow, kneel, and silently present the memorial:

*On the [day] of the new moon in the [month] of [cyclical sign], in the year of the [celestial stem-branch] under the Grand Year, I, your servant, [name], holder of the dharma rank, kowtow and bow again to submit this memorial.*

I humbly reflect: born in the lower realm, I have wandered the dusty world, my sins heavy and karma deep. Willingly I would sink into the ghostly path, having no merit to redeem my offenses, awaiting only the executioner’s blade. Yet by the grace of a peaceful age and the fortune of past vows, I have been entrusted with the precious scriptures of the Mystic Covenant and the jade registers of the Dao. I have presumptuously received the profound favor of the Great Dao, unworthily assuming the pure office of the Three Caverns. Overwhelmed by the gift of rebirth, I long to revive my withered and decayed honor. Day and night, I am moved and alarmed, yet can repay not one ten-thousandth. I vow to assist Heaven’s transformative work, aiding the state and saving the people. My resolve is to repent transgressions and pray for blessings, dispel calamities and invoke fortune, cut away evil and establish rectitude, and deliver the souls of the departed. This is my unflagging intent, never daring to slacken, that I might slightly contribute to the great transformation and atone for my accumulated faults.

I am truly awestruck and fearful. Yet though my heart is sincere and my will steadfast, adhering to Heaven’s rules, I fear that in movement and stillness, action and concealment, I may fail to accord with the true principle, unable to move the unseen and manifest, thus lacking the wondrous efficacy of spiritual penetration. Indeed, I am but a polluted being of fleshly birth, a leaking corpse dwelling in dust, with yin qi flourishing throughout my hundred bones. The harmonious qi does not fill my four limbs, so that my eyes’ light wanes, and my vision of things grows dim. How then can I see the gods and spirits, let alone penetrate the Three Realms? How can I cause evil demons to return to rectitude and establish merit in transformative work? My eyes are as if blind, my ears as if stopped.

Formerly, my initiation master [name] transmitted to me the Jade Tablet of the Primordial Unity, along with the true names of the Three Sovereigns, the inner appellations of the Numinous Perfected, and the divine texts of penetrating vision. I am now to cultivate these. Today, having chosen an auspicious day, I henceforth maintain perpetual abstinence and, in accordance with the method, ingest them.

I seek to inwardly cleanse the filth of my heart and outwardly refine the essence of the moon, desiring to penetrate the vision of gods and spirits and attain clear sight through the Three Realms. I humbly beseech:

The Jade Emperor of the Jade Clarity, Supreme Ancestral Master,
The Jade Emperor of the Highest Clarity, Supreme Lineage Master,
The Grand Emperor of the Grand Clarity, True Master,
The Jade Emperor of the August Heaven, Sacred Master,
The Grand Emperor of the Eastern Ultimate and Azure Mystery, Mystic Master,
The Perfected Lords of the Numinous Treasure Scriptures, Registers, and Salvation,
The Heavenly Lords, All the Masters of the Three Heavens and the Most High Perfected Ones,

to deign to look upon my dust-bound heart with sagely grace, not scorning my presumption, and bestow upon me Heaven’s favor. I reverently hope that you will heed my words and specially send down a hundred thousand myriad layers of Dao qi, the upright qi of the Ten Directions’ Perfected Ones, the blended radiance of the Great Dao’s wisdom, the sacred power of the Three Treasures, and the wondrous transformation of the six spiritual penetrations, entering my body.

May they scour away the dust and filth of my heart and mind, wash clean the defilement from my eyes, open the luminous passages of my viscera, absolve my offenses and karmic obstacles, and disperse stagnation from my primordial womb. May they unbind knots and open blockages, subdue all demons, and command the attendance of the myriad Perfected.

After ingesting the inner names, may I sit and observe the Three Realms, instantly illuminating the ten thousand directions, penetrating the vision of the unseen and clearly perceiving gods and spirits, secretly knowing what has not yet arisen, and brightly discerning the patterns of Heaven. May I forever escape the eight difficulties and three calamities, resolve the thousand misfortunes and nine perils. May all I undertake be auspicious, my vows proclaimed and communicated, the Great Dao flourishing, and all beings turning in faith.

I vow life after life, across kalpas and aeons, to succor the living and deliver the dead, to subdue demonic forces, and forever remain a disciple of the Three Treasures. Should I receive the mysterious radiance of karmic response, I dare not leak even a word or half a phrase of celestial mechanism. With reverence, I prostrate and present this memorial from the depths of my heart, that it may ascend directly to the gates of the Three Heavens. May it follow the incense smoke to be conveyed and memorialized before the august presence of the Great Dao, the Three Treasures, and the Most High Emperor.

I cannot but beseech your grace, my hope for the sacred is fervent, my trepidation profound. Your servant so-and-so bows his head and prostrates again to make this known.

Officials of the Incense Burner, Envoys of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant spirit-officials of the incense: may this place where I present my memorial spontaneously generate golden liquid elixir, azure mushroom blossoms, and the assembly of the hundred numinous Perfected, all gathered before this incense burner. May my vision penetrate and my spirit commune with the numinous, so that jade maidens and immortal youths from the ten directions attend the incense smoke, conveying the memorial I now submit directly to the presence of the Most Perfect, Primordial, and Utmost Great Dao—the Three Pure Ones—and the Supreme August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven.

Again bowing, I exit the oratory and enter the ritual enclosure to perform the rites.

I burn incense, knock my teeth twenty-four times, and gather my spirit. Following the previous steps, I pace the Dipper and form the Mudra of Jade Purity with both hands. Next, I recite the concealed names *hong long* and *yong jiong*, summon the Three Qi, and count thirty-two breaths through my nose.

Facing the Qian direction, I visualize the talisman of the Three Heavenly True Forms in my eyes, inhale it into the Three Palaces, where it transforms into the Three Pure Ones. They ride the Two Qi forth and stand before and behind me.

Then I imagine my body transforming into the form of a divine lord: crowned with a Jade Purity cicada-carved cap of gold and azure, clad in a crimson rosy-cloud feathered robe, sash, and vermilion shoes. Seated amidst clouds of three-colored qi, I cast the Seven Dipper with my right hand to form the Purple Tenuity Seal, and with my left, I cast the Three Fires to hold the Mudra of Jade Purity.

Next, I recite the *Esoteric Essentials of the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Divine Communication*:

"Emperor Yulan Yuming of the Supreme August Yellow Prime Heaven,
to Emperor Jiayi of the Supreme Ultimate Peaceful Nurturing Heaven,
the Great Selection of the Dharma Gate.
Thirty-two Heavens, thirty-two Emperors,
the concealed names of all heavens.
Ascend and proclaim to the Highest Clarity.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning and the Most High Dao Lord."

Again offering incense, I recite:
"Red apricot. Mao.
Ink-black. Chou.
True musk. Dui.
Socks and wax. Gao.
Numinous Treasure. Center of the middle finger."

Firmly pressing the mudra, I hold the water vessel in my left hand and the water pitcher in my right, pouring water into the vessel while reciting the *Divine Water Spell of the Northern Culmen*. With each pour, I recite the spell once, visualizing the character *ling* within the water. After seven pours and seven recitations, I inhale the northern qi and blow it into the water.

The spell:
"By the divine and sagely method of the Most High Lord Lao,
the sagely method of the Mysterious Maiden of the Nine Heavens.
Spiritual Culmen, numinous and sagely,
encountering perverse qi, it must respond to the decree and subdue."

Then, forming the Mudra of Jade Purity with both hands, I clasp them before my heart and gaze steadily at the water.

"Qian, origin, prosperity, and perseverance,
sun and moon accompany me.
I am neither hungry nor thirsty,
relying on the clarity of divine water.
The qi of the Five Phases, the essence of the Six Jia.
Numinous water enters the five viscera,
ears, eyes, and mouth become luminous.
All demons naturally return to rectitude,
longevity shares the age of heaven and earth.
Immortals together ascend in transformation,
penetrating vision beholds the Highest Clarity.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed."

Another spell:
"Qian, origin, prosperity, and perseverance,
sun and moon accompany me.
I am neither hungry nor thirsty,
wishing to obtain the clarity of divine water.
Metal, wood, water, fire, earth,
the numbers of the Five Phases, the essence of the Six Jia.
The Three True Ones of the Heavenly Granary,
impure qi is ever full.
Yellow Father and Red Child,
guard the center without inclining.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed."

Silently reciting seven times, I draw the qi of the northwest and exhale it into the water.

Next, forming the Mudra of Jade Purity with both hands, I clasp them at my waist and silently recite the *Water Spell of the Great One*, visualizing the solar fire-wheel swiftly arriving from the east, entering the water, and revolving within it—radiant and resplendent, illuminating the entire chamber.

Then I recite the *True Spell of the Great One of Heaven*:
"Reverently I invoke the Great One of Heaven, the Great One of the Primordial Beginning, true immortals and true persons, who correspond above to the Qian position.
The Six Ding assisting spirits, [missing characters],
the Six Jia guardian generals, [missing characters].
For me, receive the celestial mind above,
universally deliver the myriad numinous beings.
The numinous spell of the Great One,
the fire-wheel of the south.
Expel demons, cure illness,
penetrating vision beholds the myriad numinous.
Command the numinous water to subdue."

Silently reciting seven times, I draw the red qi of the south and exhale it into the water.

Next, forming the Mudra of Jade Purity with both hands, I clasp them before my heart and recite the *Qi-Absorbing Spell*:
"Your disciple receives qi three times a year.
Receiving the qi of heaven,
I lift my head toward the Qian direction to draw it,
responding to the Flowery Summit.
First swallowing once, then inhaling once and swallowing,
visualizing it coiling around the five viscera, filling the entire body.
Next, inhaling the qi of heaven once, I blow it into the water.
Again inhaling once, I blow it into the mirror.

The qi of earth:
I lower my head toward the Kun direction, drawing it downward,
responding to the soles of the feet.
As before, inhaling and swallowing, and blowing into the water and mirror.

The qi of the sun:
Observing the direction of the sun at that hour,
crimson qi of five colors,
responding to the left eye.
As before, inhaling and swallowing, and blowing into the water and mirror.

The qi of the moon:
Observing the direction of the moon at that hour,
silver-colored qi,
responding to the right eye.
As before, inhaling and swallowing, and blowing into the water and mirror.

The qi of the Five Stars:
Drawing from the five directions,

After ingesting the qi, recite the previous incantation three times, drawing the qi of the ten directions and blowing it into the water and mirror. Then, with both hands, move from the central joint of the middle fingers downward through the twelve cyclical signs, reciting the previous Jade Tablet of one hundred characters. Again, fix the central joint of the middle fingers, drawing the qi of the ten directions and exhaling it into the water. Next, transfer the Jade Tablet from the right hand to the left, place it into the mouth, and swallow it with the enchanted water. Take another sip of water, grasp the sword with the right hand, and facing the northeast, sigh toward the water with a commanding shout.

Inhale a mouthful of qi from the northeast and blow it into the water, then immerse both hands in the mudra within the water. Emerging from the Dipper, support the water with the right hand in the Jade Clarity mudra, and recite the *Qingxuan Heavenly Worthy’s Unifying Vision* incantation over the water:

*"Azure Youth, Spiritually Luminous, divine light perfectly radiant."*

Recite this forty-nine times, drawing the qi of the east and blowing it into the water. Then recite the *Qingxuan Divine Water* incantation:

*"Reverently invoke the Azure Mystery’s Spiritually Responsive Perfected Youth, ascending and descending in the mysterious mandate. Hasten! As decreed by the Qingxuan Heavenly Worthy."*

Recite this nine times, drawing the green qi of the east and blowing it into the water, then wash both eyes with the water. Next, offer incense and recite the *Three Heavens’ Hidden Names* thirty times, inhaling the green qi through the nose to enter the Upper Cinnabar Field from the crown. Recite the Hidden Names thirty more times, inhaling the yellow qi through the nose to merge with the green qi in the Middle Cinnabar Field. Recite the Hidden Names thirty more times, inhaling the white qi through the crown to enter the Crimson Palace, blending with the green and yellow qi in the Lower Cinnabar Field. Visualize the qi ascending and descending, circulating as one, and returning to the Lower Cinnabar Field.

**Method for Cavernous Vision in the Secluded Chamber**
For cavernous vision in a secluded chamber, first arrange the Cavernous Vision Immortal Offices along the left side, standing oneself on the right. Use a small table with incense and pure water on the right, and place a paper mirror upon it—no less than nine inches wide. Beneath the mirror, set a vessel of pure water, replacing it thrice daily. Light three pinches of incense, press the middle joints of the middle fingers together, and inscribe the Jade Clarity Summoning Seal’s true form in the air with the middle finger. Overlay the characters for sun and moon: *Yu Zhen Li* and *Jie Zhen Kan*. [Seven repetitions omitted], then write the characters for heaven and earth directly.

Next, recite the *Five Emperors’ Incantation*:
*"Hong Xing, Mo Hei, Mo Zhen, Wa La, Lingbao."*

Inhale the qi of the five directions, close the eyes, and with the left hand’s mudra, trace above the mirror. Fix the original mudra and recite the *Summoning Immortal Offices* incantation:

*"By my practice of cavernous vision, I command the officers, generals, and functionaries of the Capital of Serenity to appear in the mirror. Hasten! As the statute commands."*

Recite the invocation:
*"Jade Clarity’s Treasured Bureau, governing all true numina. Open the eyes and vision, cavernously behold gods and spirits. Let the true numina descend, manifesting their true forms. Hasten! As the statute commands."*

Reverently invoke:
*The Supreme Minister of the Golden Portals, the Great Controller of Destinies; the Eastern Ultimate Azure Radiance Emperor Lord; the Supreme One Savior from Suffering, the Qingxuan Venerable Lord; the Supreme One Savior from Calamity Heavenly Worthy; the Qingxuan Spiritually Responsive Perfected Youth Lord; the Cavernous Vision Divine Lord; the Left Divine Tiger, the Great Vision-Opening Spirit; the Right Divine Tiger, the Cavernous Vision Youth Lord; the Jade Maidens of the Three Heavens, transmitting petitions to the numinous officials; the Jade Maidens of the Ten Heavens, transmitting petitions to the numinous officials; the Supreme One’s Petition-Transmitting Numinous Officials; the Five Emperors’ Petition-Transmitting Numinous Officials; the Cavernous Observer Jade Maiden; the Distant Observer Jade Maiden; the Transcribing Talisman and Treasured Record Immortal Officers; the Cloud-Script Heavenly Writ Immortal Officers; the Demon-Discerning Jade Maidens, and all others.*

*Humbly beseech your descent to the altar, to grant me unifying vision and cavernous sight.*

Again offer incense and recite the *Great Incantation of the General Petition* (see the *Cavernous Vision Summoning and Invocation* section). Form the Jade Clarity mudra with both hands and knock the teeth nine times. Recite:

*"Supremely invoke the Cavernous Vision Immortal Offices and all others to grant me unifying vision, swiftly and clearly manifesting in the mirror."*

Knock the teeth nine more times, then recite the *First Illuminating Numinous Treasure Jade Mirror Great Radiance Divine Incantation*:

*"Hong Xing, Mo Hei, Mo Zhen, Wa La, Lingbao. Xing Sheng Zhuan, Du Li Qian. Ke Han Ming, Gong Du Cheng. Qie Jiao Zheng, Ju Hun She. Draw the qi of the three paths of heaven, earth, and humanity, and blow upon the mirror."*

Recite again:
*"Gong Du gathers the hun-souls, summoning the swift messengers of the eight directions, celestial spirits, terrestrial deities, and the myriad numina to assemble. Conjoin the celestial decree and the radiance of the Heavenly Emperor’s sun."*

Recite thrice:
*"Swiftly reveal! Swiftly reveal! [Omitted sounds] Qian Luo Qian Luo Qian Luo, swiftly come! Swiftly come! Swiftly come!"*

Draw the qi of the five directions and blow upon the mirror. Recite the incantation once more, drawing the qi of the five directions and the Ghost Gate, and blow upon the mirror. Recite the incantation again, inhale the *xun* qi, recite once more, inhale the Heavenly Gate qi, and blow into the mirror.

Next, recite the *Eight Directions’ Summoning True Incantation*:
*"Reverently invoke the great spirits of the eight trigrams—Qian, Kan, Gen, Zhen, Xun, Li, Kun, Dui—and the eight scribes. Hasten the celestial spirits and terrestrial deities of the eight directions to appear in my mirror."*

With the right hand in the Jade Clarity mudra, use the second finger to mark eight points on the mirror, beginning from the *qian* direction, blowing the qi of the eight directions to summon the spirits into the mirror. Recite:

*"Heaven and earth ascend and descend, the two qi intermingling. The yin and yang qi, the sun and moon conjoined in radiance. By my salvation and summoning, cavernously behold the numinous spirits. Above in heaven, below on earth, the yin and yang spirits. Follow my precious mirror, instantly revealing true forms."*

Draw a medium breath of *xun* qi from the southeast and *qian* qi from the northwest, blow upon the mirror—this is called the *Upper Mystery Qi*.

Next, recite the *Cutting Mirror to Behold Heavenly Spirits* incantation:
*"From whence do I gain the power to cut the mirror and behold the heavenly spirits? The yin intestines harmonize and follow, the imperial decree dispatches flying spirits. By the practice of the Numinous Treasure’s illumination, the Black Crow of the East and the Red Emperor’s spirits. The restraining force must not be heard—let the Three Terraces converge in the mirror."*

The sun and moon stir with numinous intent, and all the spirit-officials within the realm swiftly manifest their forms as commanded.

Draw *qi* from the south and blow upon it, then recite the *Purple Ultimate Incantation*:
*"Disciple So-and-So humbly petitions the Supreme Purple Ultimate, the Great Primordial Celestial Worthy of Original Commencement, the Supreme Dao-One Lord, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Great Master of the Mysterious Center, the Left Mysterious Perfected, and the Right Mysterious Perfected. Upon hearing this disciple’s invocation, open the Golden Essence, stir the Jade Portal, and illuminate all within heaven above, earth below, and the human realm—boundless and immeasurable—drawing the millions into the radiance, swiftly revealing their forms."*

Draw *qi* from the southeast and blow upon it, then recite the *Moving Scenery and Pervading Light Spirit Incantation*:
*"Spirit-light, spirit-light, illumine the eight directions. Above, it connects with the sun and moon; below, it penetrates the frigid regions. East, west, south, and north—it universally shines upon the ten thousand states. Heavenly spirits and true immortals, landscapes and mountains, rivers and seas, their sources, spectral beings and hidden abysses—wherever the Three Luminaries shine, none may conceal themselves. The spirit-light mirror seizes all, leaving no gap finer than a hair. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Three Radiances of Supreme Purity and the Celestial Worthy of Original Commencement."*

After reciting the incantation once, visualize the sun in the east, the moon in the west, and the Dipper in the north, then summon:
*The Youth of Sunlight, the Youth of Moonlight, the Youth of Starlight, the Cavern Youth, and the Luminous Youth.*

Mobilize the essence of the Three Luminaries and the Mysterious Dipper, the sixfold-pervading spirit-light, to illuminate the ten directions and the Three Realms, drawing the myriad scenes and thousand truths into the mirror to manifest their forms. For divining persons or objects, revealing the future or the unmanifest, and communicating with spirits to invoke their numinous response, command the officials of this ministry and the celestial bureaus of vision to connect with this disciple’s sight, swiftly revealing their forms within the mirror.

Gaze intently into the mirror: if clouds of *qi* like incense smoke appear, or golden and silver specks in five colors fall like rain, then after seven days, the visions will gradually emerge. If you hear voices speaking, or faintly perceive the faces of spirit-perfected, or see impressions like embossed script on paper, or true immortals descend in traces, or detect wondrous fragrances, then within a month, the spirits will manifest their forms.

Should such signs appear in the mirror, proceed with the *Heaven and Earth Descending Qi Incantation*:
*"Heaven and earth descend with *qi*, the sun and moon unite in brightness. Illuminate the numinous spirits of heaven above and earth below, revealing their forms within this mirror. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes and ordinances."*

Draw the *qi* of heaven and earth and blow it into the mirror, then fix your gaze upon it as if discerning the eye of an embroidery needle, concentrating your spirit wholly within the mirror. At first, it may resemble incense smoke or mist veiling the mirror; after several days, five-colored golden stars will scatter and dazzle the eyes. After more days, you will see clouds of *qi* and human shadows moving to and fro. Later still, five-colored clouds of *qi* will come and go, and the celestial perfected will gradually emerge.

Recite the *Heaven and Earth Conjoined Qi Incantation*:
*"Heaven and earth conjoin their *qi*, the sun and moon unite in brightness. Humbly summon the descending true *qi* to swiftly reveal their forms within the mirror."*

Recite this incantation three times. Upon completion, reverently summon the *Descending True Talisman* to manifest forms, then the *Summoning Spirit Talisman* to appear. Next, summon the *King Youth* to manifest: on yang days, the *Golden Youth*; on yin days, the *Jade Youth*, who will appear. Then summon the *Jade Maiden* to manifest, followed by the *Jade Maiden of the Current Decade*. Only thereafter may you summon at will, observing the order in which forms manifest within the mirror, then within the paper mirror, then upon the earth. Next, establish communication.

At this stage, maintain strict discipline and conduct. Continue to offer the *Descending True* and *Summoning Spirit Talismans* before the sacred altar, presenting incense and fruit on the new and full moons.

*Summoning the Hundred Spirits with the Heaven and Earth Conjoined Qi Incantation*:
*"Heaven and earth conjoin their *qi*, the sun and moon unite in brightness. Regarding such-and-such matter below heaven—whether illuminating spirits, the aggrieved, or spectral beings—swiftly reveal their forms within the mirror."*

*Moving Scenery and Pervading Light Incantation*:
*"Heaven and earth descend with *qi*, the sun and moon unite in brightness. Illuminate the spirits below heaven to manifest their forms in such-and-such place."*

Form the *Jade Purity Mudra* with both hands, draw the *qi* of heaven and earth, and blow it upon the designated location. Upon completion, invoke the *Descending True Talisman* to manifest forms, proceeding in order.

If the visions remain unclear, use consecrated water to wash the eyes and observe carefully. Recite the incantation:
*"Azure Youth, numinous and bright, spirit-light perfectly radiant."*

Perform this nine times, draw *qi* from the east, and blow it into the previously consecrated water. Wash the eyes nine times, then wash the ears nine times with the consecrated water, reciting:
*"Humbly invoke the Numinous Response Perfected Youth of the Azure Mystery, ascending and descending with the primordial mandate. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Celestial Worthy of the Azure Mystery."*

Face east and silently recite this incantation eighty-one times, draw *qi* from the east, and blow it into the water. With the left hand, form the *Jade Purity Mudra*, and with the right hand, press the central line of the middle finger. Use the right middle finger to wash each eye twenty-one times, then wipe them dry.

Next, recite the *Heaven and Earth Descending Qi Incantation*, hasten the mudra, and gaze intently into the mirror. Proceed in order with the summons, directing and deploying as desired.

After twenty-one days, if no forms appear, maintain strict discipline and daily practice, proceeding in order with the *Seven Urgent Incantations*.

*Sequence of the Seven Urgent Incantations*
*First Urgent Incantation*:
*"Cloud-script of the Great Void, at the dawn of kalpas. Now distant, now near, now sinking, now floating. Wandering the five directions, spanning over a *zhang*. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign took brush in hand to write. The Celestial Worthy of Original Commencement descended, and the true script unfolded. First, the Cavern Chapters were performed; next, the numinous talismans were inscribed. Brightly it exists; obscurely it vanishes. Stagnation naturally resolves, and the drowned in worldly toil may float. The hidden and the manifest, on the verge of submersion, thereby ascend to the immortal realms. Now I open both eyes to perceive the void with penetrating vision. The celestial script stretches a *zhang* in length, its forms appearing as fine script. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Celestial Worthy of Numinous Treasure and the Celestial Heart."*

Conclude, then ingest and swallow the Jade Character, visualizing all the spirits of the incantation entering the *Dantian*, attending the Heavenly Worthy on left and right, ascending together into the *Niwan Palace*. The spirit will then emerge of its own accord, visible in the mirror.
Recite again the names of the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Emperors, and the hidden taboos of the various heavens, concluding with the invocation of *Shangqing*. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the golden mouth of the *Yuanshi Tianzun*.

Upon the altar, suspend a mirror; before the face, set water. The yang spirit resides in the mirror, the yin spirit in the water. O Numinous Treasure Perfected, reverently summon such-and-such spirit—herein, swiftly manifest your form.

Assemble them within the body, permitting no dispersal or disorder.

Then strike the teeth and silently intone:

The Nine Palaces of the Great Spirit,
the Great One guards the chamber.
The hundred spirits assume their stations,
soul and spirit harmonize their offices.
Long life and enduring vision,
sealing away evil and misfortune.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes of the Upper Clarity!

If, while practicing penetrating vision of spirits, fear arises, employ this method.

This rite, when observed with purification and ingested, will perfect realization on the appointed day. Cycling without end, one may command and employ the immortals, fulfilling all in purity.

The Dao of the Numinous Treasure comprises three ranks:
Above, the Way of the Imperial Unity’s Returning Wind, bestowed upon the Jade Clarity.
In the middle, the method of the Five Qi’s blending in central harmony, entrusted to the Five Emperors.
Below, the scripture of the Ten Revolutions of Returning Spirit, conferred upon the various perfected.

Beyond these three grades, those who take up the remnants do so to aid the living and deliver the dead as their merit, and to summon the perfected and invoke the numinous as their method.

Those who study the supreme Dao, aspiring to immortality, all begin here.

The Great Rites of the *Numinous Treasure Upper Scripture of Limitless Salvation*, Scroll Fourteen—concluded.
The Great Rites of the *Numinous Treasure Upper Scripture of Limitless Salvation*, Scroll Fifteen.

**The Numinous Treasure Method of Penetrating Vision**

**Internal Practice of Penetrating Vision**
Withdraw the spirit, then on the right, generate thirty-six breaths upward. Inhale, and on yang days, first generate twenty-four breaths on the left. For the numinous spirit, on yin days, reduce twenty-four breaths on the right. Manifest form, then on the left, generate thirty-six breaths downward.

On yang days, first thirty-six breaths form one line, becoming *Qian*. Then twenty-four breaths form one line, transforming into the *Kun* hexagram. On yin days, first twenty-four breaths form one line, becoming *Kun*. Then thirty-six breaths form one line, transforming into the *Qian* hexagram.

Each day, after swallowing the jade talisman, sit upright, regulate the breath, gather the spirit in the *qi*-sea, and draw breath into the cinnabar field. Visualize true *qi* within the kidneys, like red threads, inscribing the four characters of the middle chapter within the cinnabar field. Once complete, apply the fire-phase to nurture it: with the nose, draw the azure *qi* from the heavens into the navel’s depths, shaping it into one yang line, vermilion in hue, and arrange it within the *qi*-sea. Six times, draw azure *qi* to form six yang lines. Then with the nose, draw the yellow *qi* from the heavens into the *qi*-sea, shaping it into one yin line. Again, draw yellow *qi* six times to complete six yin lines, then cease. While drawing *qi* through the nose, silently count the breaths: nine on yang days, six on yin days. Do not be too forceful. Do not swallow the *qi* as it descends; instead, guide it into the six lines.

Once complete, on yang days turn left forty-nine times, on yin days turn right thirty-six times within the *qi*-sea to harmonize the *qi*. After turning, click the teeth nine times and stop. If turbid *qi* or flatulence arises, let it flow naturally; do not suppress it.

**Incantation for the Penetrating Vision Catalyst Method**
*Queen Mother’s immortal [talisman] gathers, Queen Mother’s immortal peach gathers. Queen Mother’s true qi descends; today I consume the immortal [talisman]. Let me reach the eastern household; today I consume the immortal peach. Let me reach the jasper and jade, to behold the Eastern King Father. The King Father commands the Azure Lad; the Azure Lad descends with my decree. The Queen Mother descends with true qi, letting me know fortune and misfortune, granting me penetrating vision to clearly see all ghosts and spirits, transforming without obstruction. King Father’s true qi gathers, Queen Mother’s true qi gathers.*

**Method of Focused Contemplation**
The Eastern King Father wears five-colored robes and a crimson crown; his name is *Wuwei* ("Non-Action"), his style *Jun Jie* ("Lord of Liberation"). To his left is Wang Qiao, to his right Red Pine Master. Dwelling in the sun’s midst, he is called *Jun A* ("Lord Alas"), named *Fuxi*, ancestor of the ten thousand spirits, forebear of the ten thousand *qi*. The Western Queen Mother wears a five-colored cloud-topped chignon; her name is *Ziran* ("Spontaneity"), her style *Jun Si* ("Lord of Reflection"). To her left is the Jade Maiden of the Round Light, to her right the Jade Maiden of Grand Yin, ancestress of the primordial *qi* of the Great Void, forebear of the ten thousand *qi*. This should be practiced constantly.

**Method for Invoking Officials to Open the Eyes**
Repeatedly invoke the Jade Maidens of Weak Water, one thousand four hundred in number, clad in white, to serve as ministers and convey divine visions, discerning fortune and misfortune across ten thousand miles. Next, visualize within stillness five-colored lads, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, joyfully entering the eyes. Then recite the incantation:

*The lad of the left eye is named Flying Spirit,
The lad of the right eye is named Morning Infant.
Resplendent as celestial might casting shooting stars,
Radiantly gazing without end, penetrating Jade Clarity.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*

After visualizing the lads, click the teeth nine times, recite the incantation nine times, draw in azure *qi*, rinse the mouth with saliva three times, and send it into the liver. With both thumbs, press the *Rijun* ("Sun Lord") mudra against the eyes nine times, then stop.

**The Immortal’s Method of Penetrating Vision**
Three days prior, purify and bathe. At the third watch, when the moon is at its zenith, one must not fail to see the moon. Upon seeing the moon, offer incense and pray:

*On this day of the Three Primes, your servant [Name] respectfully invokes General Zhou, the Grand Yin Lord, the Right Crystal Water Mother, the True Ministers of the Three Heavens, the Envoys of Upper Clarity, the Radiant Illuminators of the Six Pitches, the Moon’s Rear Light-Spreaders, the Dark Cavern Lord, the Sun Illuminator, the Supreme Obscurity Lord, the Inner Perfected of the Three Sovereigns of Upper Clarity, the True August Ones Assisting the Mandate of the Three Heavens, the Primordial August Ones of the Five Luminaries. May the lords and ministers of the registers not dare to harm or injure wantonly. I pray for the opening of the right eye’s penetrating vision, to see the forms of ghosts and spirits, entering as the method directs, infusing great luminosity. From the eye to the brain, from the brain to the eye, coming and going without obstruction, may I fully attain the divine immortals. Today I receive the qi; may my wish be fulfilled.*

After reciting, step back, align with the *ding* trigram, advance three steps, hold the breath, and gaze fixedly at the moonlight. Draw the moon’s radiant *qi* through the nose and swallow it completely, then exhale the *qi* into the hands and rub the eyes. Recite again:

*Revolving winds merge; the dharma master descends with light. The lad gathers.*

After reciting, rub the eyes and chant the incantation six times, then stop. From the day of receiving this method onward, always collect dew in a vessel at dawn to wash the eyes. If no dew is available, ice, frost, or snow may be used.

**For the practice of penetrating vision:**
Press the mudra of your original master, turn once, then press and hold at the corresponding celestial stem of the day. Close the left eye and gaze with the right, fixing the vision without blinking. Avoid seeing corpses or impurities. If unable to avoid a corpse and it is seen, resolve it by writing a vermilion talisman, placing it in water, and washing the eyes.

**Incantation for the Penetrating Vision Gathering Method:**
*Where the sun and moon of heaven and earth shine, the ten thousand spirits manifest their forms.*

First write the two characters *Daoyan* ("Dao Speech"), then recite the above incantation. Next recite [the missing characters], turn left seven times, then draw in breath and blow it into the hands to rub the eyes—most efficacious. When summoning the souls of the deceased, blow onto paper curtains or banners.

**Another Incantation:**
*The pool of the left eye’s divine pearl,
The pool of the right eye’s jade pearl.
I pray for divine talismans and divine water to wash my two eyes,
Making them clear and bright, seeing ten thousand miles afar.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*

**Incantation:**
*Heaven opens, earth is obscured;
Ask one, know ten; ask ten, know a hundred.*

**Talisman Incantation:**
*The divine talisman enters the abdomen—
the heart opens, the mind is enlightened,
ears and eyes grow keen and bright.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*

Burn the talisman to ash and swallow it with pure water. Visualize the qi of the northeast. **Another Method: The Jade-Character Visualization for Penetrating Vision**

Enter stillness, knock the teeth nine times, and sit to regulate the breath for eighty-one cycles. When the breath is even, visualize the Primordial Celestial Venerable, the Supreme Dao Lord, and the Supreme Old Lord seated upon the divine tortoise at the center of the kidneys, with the Queen Mother and the Ding-Jia spirits in attendance. The cinnabar of the heart shines like the sun.

Then, in accordance with the scripture, visualize the body seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, dense and luxuriant within and without. The Upper Cinnabar Field is blue, the Middle Cinnabar Field is yellow, and the Lower Cinnabar Field is white—both inner and outer like fortified walls, merging with the chamber of the body.

Visualize the Azure Dragon emerging from the liver to stand on the left, the White Tiger from the lungs to stand on the right, the Vermilion Bird from the heart to stand in front, and the Dark Warrior from the kidneys to stand behind. Six lions emerge from the back of the heart, and six white cranes from the crown, arrayed on either side, their radiance like rainbows, illuminating the ten directions. The sun and moon shine brightly, suffusing the chamber with light.

Visualize the sun and moon emerging from the two eyes, their brilliance illuminating the room. A circular image arises from the crown, its light reflecting in all directions. The radiance of the sun and moon streams forth from the Great Power in two paths, merging above into a perfect sphere of luminous color.

Next, visualize the thirty-two celestial palaces of the four directions, with jade halls and golden towers suspended in five-colored clouds. Within the palaces, envision the Celestial Emperors in crimson robes and imperial crowns, seated in solemn dignity.

When this vision is clear, begin from the Heaven of Boundless August, knocking the teeth once and bowing with utmost reverence. Then recite the secret incantation:

*Supreme Mysterious Origin, Supreme Dao Lord—
Summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers,
the Attendant Messengers of the Left and Right,
the Golden Lads who tend the incense,
the Jade Maidens who scatter flowers,
the Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors,
and the Incense Officials of the Day—
thirty-two each—
to come forth and transmit my words.
Today is an auspicious day,
a day of prolonged purity and reverence in the hall of cultivation,
as I practice this scripture to deliver boundless beings.
I, your servant, seek penetrating vision of the ten thousand spirits,
unobstructed sight of gods and ghosts,
that my entreaties may ascend directly
to the august presence of the Primordial Celestial Venerable,
Supreme Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens.*

When finished, draw with the nose the qi of the Eight Heavens of the East into the liver, the Eight Heavens of the West into the lungs, the Eight Heavens of the South into the heart, and the Eight Heavens of the North into the kidneys. Then observe the day’s earthly branch, face the celestial position of the corresponding direction, and sit as though in conjunction with the day.

Recite the incantation:

*Silent, silent—unto the ultimate Source,
Vastly towering, aeons high in the Void.
Profound and open, the scripture of the Mysterious Cavern—
Who can fathom its hidden depths?
Once entered upon the Great Vehicle’s path,
Who reckons the kalpas’ span?
Neither born nor extinguished,
Yet born through the lotus’s cause.
Transcending the Three Realms’ bonds,
With compassionate heart, the world’s snares are undone.
The Perfected, of supreme virtue,
Generation upon generation, become immortals’ kin.*

Recite again:

*Cloud-script of the Great Void,
Realm of the boundless kalpa.
Now distant, now near,
Now sinking, now floating.
Wandering the Five Directions,
Beyond a zhang’s reach.
The Celestial Perfected, the August One,
Takes brush in hand to inscribe.
Expounding the Cavern’s chapters,
Next writing the numinous talismans.
The Primordial Descends,
The True Writ unfurls.
Luminous—it exists;
Obscure—it is not.
Stagnation dissolves of itself,
Worldly toil may be buoyed.
The hidden and manifest shall emerge,
Thereby ascending the Immortals’ capital.
Those who utter this vow,
Humbly seek penetrating vision of the ten thousand spirits,
Unobstructed sight of gods and ghosts,
Universal deliverance without end,
Salvation of the dark and unseen.*

Recite the Jade Tablet once, swallow the Hidden Taboo once more, then visualize the qi of the corresponding heaven’s color, billowing and swirling. Next, behold the Heavenly Emperor, whose mouth emits a beam of the same-colored light, merging with the qi in a single stream that descends to pour through the crown of the head. In succession, it fills the seven orifices and suffuses the entire body. After a long while, look up toward the celestial direction—there, the eight vermilion characters of the corresponding heaven appear, radiant in the void.

Then, with the nose, draw in the Jade Characters: inhale one into the heart, one into the spleen, one into the lungs, one into the liver; with the nose, draw one into the kidneys; with the mouth, inhale one into the Mud Pill Palace, one into the Central Cinnabar Field, and one into the Lower Cinnabar Field—all eight characters complete. Visualize them entering the five viscera and three cinnabar fields, glowing red as firelight. After a long time, suddenly the eyes perceive visions in dreams, and inner sight becomes clear—this is the auspicious sign of penetrating vision. For those of pure conduct, traversing the Eight Heavens daily, or within a single day and night, suffices. Within seven days, one may see the immortals and spirits.

Visualize the three fields and five viscera suffused with five-colored purple light, illuminating the five organs and seven orifices. After completing eight bows, rise and proceed with the method.

**Three Sovereigns’ Numinous Heaven Talisman**
Recite the incantation for inscribing the Numinous Heaven Talisman:

*Nine Elderly Lords Imperial,
Great Divinities of the Immortals’ Capital,
Three Sovereign Lords,
Eight Seats of Perfected Spirits.
Direct Talismans of the Six Jia,
Hundred Spirits of the Three Officials.
Today I ingest the Numinous Heaven Divine Talisman,
To know the future’s fortune and misfortune.
Announce to my heart’s spirits,
Respond to matters with efficacy,
Communicate with the sagely, communicate with the numinous.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Nine Elderly Lords Imperial’s statutes and commands.*

When the incantation and brushwork are complete, execute the Jade Clarity Mudra. [Text damaged]... Three-Seven-Day Talisman-Script Ingestion Method. When finished, next inscribe and ingest the Numinous Heaven Talisman.

**Three Sovereign Lords’ Penetrating Vision Talisman**
The Supreme Lord Lao’s Penetrating Vision Talisman—ingest on a *tiankai* day. Within a year, one may see ten thousand *li*.

Inscribe the talisman on a mirror; when gazing at one’s reflection, one constantly sees the west while facing east, and perceives treasures within stone.

**Supreme Lord’s Eight Scribes Penetrating Vision Talisman**
Inscribe in cinnabar on paper, expose to sunlight, and swallow with clear water. Also ingest the talisman by casting it into water, then wash the eyes—gazing afar, one may see a thousand *li*. Cast the talisman into water while facing the rising sun. When cast into water, the eyes gain far-reaching sight.

**Jade Clarity Eye-Opening Method**
Recite the incantation:

*Suppress the Flying Star and swallow it—
Celestial Fire Star’s numen,
Descend into your servant’s body.
Ghosts and spirits clearly seen,
Merging in perfect alignment.*

To the right: ingest the radiance of the shooting star. The method states: after receiving the radiant qi and swallowing it into the Cinnabar Field, sit in stillness and observe the qi within the Cinnabar Field spiraling upward. From the left of the Cinnabar Field, it rises to wash away the filth around both eyes, then returns to the Cinnabar Field.

**Eye-Opening Incantation and Talisman**
*Luminous, luminous,
Illuminating the Eastern Numen.
Sage within the Mysterious,
Divinity within the Sage.
Divine numen bestowed upon the Perfected,
Uniting with the Dao as one.
Washing or swallowing, both are permissible—
Inscribe in vermilion on yellow paper,
Eastern qi, Jade Clarity Seal.*

**Supreme Lord’s Water-Charmed Eye-Washing Penetrating Vision Incantation**
*The sun rises in the east,
Resplendent with great light.
Divine spirits guard me,
Eye-Opening Immortal Youth.
I descend to the Wandering Granary,
Swiftly bestow upon the Youth of Tong.
Three Primes fill the body,
Eight Spirits fortify the borders.
Yellow Elder’s statutes and commands,
Swiftly command the eyes’ radiance.
Illuminate the revolving world,
Swiftly employ the Youth of Tong.
Wandering Granary Youth complete,
Tong and Mang.
Swiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands decree.*

This method: on a *mao* or *you* day at dawn, face the sun, recite seven times, draw in the sun’s qi, and blow it into water to wash the eyes—forty-nine times. Calm the spirit, close the eyes, sit in stillness, then open them after a short while. Repeat for seven days, and one may see ghosts and spirits. After forty-nine days, one may see celestial beings.

Begin on a *mao* or *you* day, reciting the charmed water seven times each morning. Blow the sun’s qi before the sacred, then have men and women wash fifty times. As before, close the eyes, sit in stillness for a short while, then suddenly open them—one may see celestial beings, ghosts, and spirits. Avoid *xin* days and inauspicious sights.

When finished, conclude the method with the incantation.

The statutes and commands of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi summon the wandering youths and venerable elders. Retrieve the original arrangement, lest the divine mechanism be revealed. Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes and commands of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi decree.

With the sleeve, recite the incantation and blow upon the eyes; with the sleeve, brush the faces of men and women, then administer maltose soup. This method employs the Seven Stars divine incantation: each day, face the sun and recite forty-nine times, then charm the water to drink and wash the eyes. At night, face the Northern Dipper and recite forty-nine times, then charm the water to drink and wash the eyes. After one hundred days, the divine youths shall tread the Dipper’s steps. At the hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*, recite seven times each to avert warfare, floods, droughts, comets, and baleful stars, prolong life and attain immortality, slay myriad ghosts, spread qi, and dispel the hundred diseases.

**The Supreme Luminous Divine Talisman**
For all talisman-writing: form the Dipper mudra with the left hand, grasp the brush with the right, and recite the brush incantation:
*"This brush is most efficacious, bestowed upon me by the Heavenly Emperor.
True immortals guard my form, dispelling anomalies and illness.
Grant me long life, as I write talismans and charm water.
Preserve harmony and prosperity. Swiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands decree."*
Upon completion, draw in the Dipper’s qi through the nose and blow upon the brush, flicking the mudra.
*"By command, by command—single force, pure and direct.
Heaven oversees the head, Earth oversees the feet.
Humans oversee the hands, Bian Que oversees the eyes.
Wherever the divine talisman arrives, the hundred diseases vanish.
Swiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands decree."*

This talisman specializes in treating all eye ailments in men and women, greatly enhancing vision and clarity. On the four *li* days, or the four beginnings of *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai*, the first day of the lunar month, *jiazi* days, *gengshen* days, or one’s own life-destiny day, burn incense facing the kingly direction (east in spring, north in winter). Write in vermilion as per the previous method, without limit—more is better. Each day before use, place one talisman into a bowl of pure water, soak, and wash both eyes. Recite the talisman-immersion incantation:
*"The left eye is the Pool of Divine Pearls; the right eye is the Pool of Jade Pearls.
Now, with this divine talisman immersed in water, I wash my eyes.
May they become clear and bright, seeing ten thousand miles afar.
Swiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands decree."*
Upon completion, stir with a stick. Before washing the eyes, recite:
*"The sun rises in the east, lush and golden.
The divine talisman transforms the water, washing eye pains and sores.
As the pernicious qi of the people scatters, turbid qi vanishes.
By the divine talisman’s dharma-water, the eyes gain radiance.
Swiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands decree."*

**The Method for Sacrificing to Wells to Dispel Malevolent Qi (Proven Efficacy)**
On the Three Assemblies, *jiazi* or *gengshen* days, the Three Origins, or the Eight Festivals, prepare ten cups each of cypress broth, tea, and wine, along with seasonal fruits, rare flowers, incense, and lamps, arranging them on a mat. Offer incense, tread the Dipper, transform the spirit, face the well, and recite the incantation while absorbing the qi of the daily direction and blowing it into the well:
*"I, the minor adept [name], humbly offer sacrifice to the great deities within the well, the well’s youths, the well’s divine generals, the well’s numinous qi, the well’s straight guardians, and all spirits of the well.
I rely on the well’s divine qi of the earth’s springs to ingest, wash, and cleanse my viscera, purging filth and turbidity, washing away the accumulated dust and grime from my ears and eyes.
Water embodies divine efficacy; upon success, we shall share the reward. I dare not betray this vow."*
Knock the teeth three times, recite the well-seizing incantation one hundred times, and form the *xu* and *hai* mudras. The incantation:
*"The frigid waters of the vast pool flow clear and deep.
Qi spreads boundlessly, birthing myriad paths of light.
The springs of the five directions circulate without cease.
By the Emperor’s decree, all realms submit.
Whoever dares defile this shall be punished by fire and bell.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Azure Mystery’s command decrees."*

**Treading the Dipper to Encircle the Well and Suppress Evil**
Align as the Celestial Pivot: *zi* corresponds to the well’s *wu*, *wu* to the well’s *zi*, and so forth. Transform the spirit, tread the Dipper, and leap the Seven Stars into the well, visualizing the trodden stars flowing into it. Tread the Dipper as usual. Afterward, inscribe the *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* talismans on peachwood boards and nail them at the well’s four sides to establish boundaries, preventing ghostly qi from clashing with the well’s qi. Thus, the water becomes easily clear, pure, and luminous—scholars should study this deeply.

**The True Well-Suppressing Talismans**
- **Northern Earth Talisman**: Blow northern qi, form the *zi* mudra.
- **Southern Earth Talisman**: Blow southern qi, form the *wu* mudra.
- **Eastern Earth Talisman**: Blow eastern qi, form the *mao* mudra.
- **Western Earth Talisman**: Blow western qi, form the *you* mudra.

**The Method for Crafting and Sacrificing to Mirrors**
To craft a mirror: cut a round mirror from paper. Then, obtain two ancient mirrors—one yin, one yang—and place them in a case on either side, ensuring no filth remains. Offer incense, flowers, wine, and fruit in sacrifice. Recite the mirror-seizing incantation and pray:
*"I, the minor adept [name], humbly offer sacrifice to the numinous deities within this mirror, the mirror’s numinous qi, the mirror’s straight guardians, and all spirits of the mirror.
I have received the Supreme Mystery’s Primordial Treasure Mirror, penetrating yin and yang, darkness and light, revealing gods, spirits, ghosts, and demons, seeking divine communion.
Today, I sacrifice to you, divine spirits. May you grant me eyes that see clearly and ears that hear keenly, with vision and hearing penetrating all, perceiving the unfathomable mechanisms of yin and yang.
Upon success, we shall share the reward. I shall never betray this vow. Divine spirits, heed my plea."*
Knock the teeth three times and recite the mirror-seizing incantation one hundred times. Form the Jade Emperor mudra and recite:
*"The Supreme Mystery’s Sovereign refines qi to clarity.
The Yellow Emperor and Laozi forged it, empowered by the Supreme.
It reveals ghosts and gods, penetrating the hidden and obscure.
Spirits cannot conceal their qi; ghosts cannot escape their forms.
Where the thousand harmonies align, the hundred demons converge.
Whoever dares remain unseen shall be obliterated without trace.
Those who should appear must do so swiftly, disobeying none.
Spirits within the mirror, numinous guardians of the mirror,
On the day of shared success, ascend together to the Upper Clarity.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Upper Clarity’s statutes and commands decree."*

**Sacrificing to the Seal to Attain Numinous Communication**
The adept selects an auspicious day for artisans to carve the **Numinous Treasure Grand Dharma Bureau Seal**, the **Three Heavens Supreme Seal**, the **Three Heavens Petition-Unifying Seal**, the **Nine Numinous Petition Seal**, and other **Lingbao seals**. Prepare twelve portions each of incense, flowers, wine, and fruit for the sacrifice to the spirits within the seals.

**Incantation for the Sacrifice to the Seal’s Spirits**

The minor adept, True Person of [such-and-such] surname, respectfully offers sacrifice to the great spirits within the seal.

Spirits within the seal, true *qi* true persons, seal-wielding numinous officials, jade maidens attendant to the seal, jade lads attendant to the seal, immortal soldiers of the seal, spirits within the seal—

I have received the **Grand Dharma of the Numinous Treasure**, empowered to command ghosts and gods, summon immortal soldiers, achieve penetrating vision, and wander in company with the spirits, forever becoming a perfected one.

May you, the numinous immortals within the seal, accept this sincere offering. Assist my *Dao*-*qi*, and when the work is accomplished, share in its fruits. I dare not betray or disobey.

Knock the teeth thrice, recite the **Seal-Subduing Incantation** one hundred times, and execute the **Dujian Mudra**.

**Incantation:**
Spirits are true, *qi* is true—*qi* true, spirits true.
Spirits divide the Supreme Ultimate, *qi* grasps the Highest Clarity.
The mysterious seal transforms, wondrously responsive, wondrously numinous.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes and commands decree.

**The Unobstructed Perception of the Profound**

Those who study the Way of summoning the true must cultivate distant thought and far-reaching contemplation, inwardly gazing in stillness. Seated in observation without limit, they penetrate the vision of the hidden void.

After three years of dwelling in the hidden void, the center becomes precisely aligned. The true spirits unfold in radiance, foreknowing what has yet to come. They scrutinize the utmost bounds of heaven, illuminating all that is hidden, governing all that is above, and surveying all that is below.

Thus they receive the titles of the Supreme Thearch, bestowed through accumulated resonance—how could one assume such rank at birth?

At dawn, when the light of heaven has yet to divide and the first blue radiance begins to emerge, the adept rubs their hands together until warm, then wipes both eyes—each thirty-seven times. They knock the teeth twenty-four times, then lick and swirl the tongue around the mouth’s interior, above and below, until saliva overflows. They swallow *qi* nine times.

When finished, they cover their entire body with a blanket or robe, settle the body, and lie down in stillness, aligning the center with precision. They ensure inner and outer silence, hearing no sound. Hands cover the ears, eyes close, and inwardly they visualize themselves perceiving events nine myriad *li* to the east—mountains, rivers, earth, colors, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and the peoples of the Hu—all as if present before them, vivid and distinct.

If the alignment is unsteady, they visualize again. With time, the vision will naturally appear. Once distinct, they hear within their ears the clear ringing of bells and drums. After a long while, they further perceive the immortal officials of the Eastern Marchmount, riding azure dragons and emerald clouds, bearing the Five Sacred Fungi. Twelve jade maidens in flying azure feathered skirts accompany them, carrying blue-essence jade nectar in golden platters, offering it to their body.

Upon seeing the immortal officials, they bow and receive it, then consume it, tasting its sweetness. They wipe their eyes again, swallow *qi* nine times, and continue thus for three years. Their eyes will see events ten thousand *li* away, their ears hear sounds ten thousand *li* distant—all made luminously clear. They will foreknow the fortunes and misfortunes, blessings and calamities, and the span of years yet to come.

The adept’s body will then emanate a wondrous light, penetrating within and without. The method of the true Way is most sublime. It is transmitted mouth to mouth, not committed to writing. The adept must silently uphold and practice it.

The adept then turns their contemplation, as in the method above, to visualize events nine myriad *li* to the south—mountains, rivers, earth, colors, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and the peoples of the Yue—all as if present before them, vivid and distinct. If the alignment is unsteady, they visualize again. With time, the vision will naturally appear.

Once distinct, they hear within their ears the clamor of a hundred sounds. After a long while, they perceive the immortal officials of the Southern Marchmount, riding cinnabar clouds beneath a vermilion canopy. Twelve jade maidens in flying crimson brocade skirts accompany them, bearing dark-net scarlet fruits in golden platters, offering them to their body.

Upon seeing the immortal officials, they bow and receive it, then consume it, tasting its sourness. They wipe their eyes again, swallow *qi* nine times, and continue thus for three years. Naturally, they will penetrate the vision of the hidden void, their eyes seeing ten thousand *li* beyond, their ears hearing sounds ten thousand *li* distant. With prolonged practice, all becomes luminously clear, and they foreknow the fortunes and misfortunes yet to come. Their body will be suffused with jade-like luster, their face radiant with jade light.

The Way of summoning the true is most sublime. The Thearch transmits it mouth to mouth; it must not be committed to writing.

The adept then turns their contemplation, as in the method above, to visualize events nine myriad *li* to the west—mountains, rivers, earth, colors, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and the peoples of the Xuan—all as if present before them, vivid and distinct. If the alignment is unsteady, they visualize again. With time, the vision will naturally appear.

Once distinct, they hear within their ears the resonant clamor of gongs and drums. After a long while, they perceive the immortal officials of the Western Marchmount, riding a flying chariot of plain clouds. Twelve jade maidens in flying purple brocade skirts accompany them, bearing golden liquid and cinnabar essence in golden platters.

Upon seeing the immortal officials, they bow and receive it, then consume it, tasting its sweetness. They wipe their eyes, swallow *qi* nine times, and cease. After three years of this, their vision will penetrate all. They will perceive events ten thousand *li* beyond, foreknowing fortunes and misfortunes with luminous clarity. Their face will take on a golden countenance.

The Way of summoning the true must not be committed to writing; it is transmitted mouth to mouth.

The adept then turns their contemplation, as in the method above, to visualize events nine myriad *li* to the north—mountains, rivers, earth, colors, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and the peoples of the Qiang—all as if present before them, vivid and distinct. If the alignment is unsteady, they visualize again. With time, the vision will naturally appear.

Once distinct, they hear within their ears the clear ringing of bronze bells. After a long while, they perceive the immortal officials of the Northern Marchmount, riding a flying chariot of dark clouds, bearing the Five Sacred Fungi. Twelve jade maidens in flying black brocade skirts accompany them, carrying jade-like nectar and languid sustenance in golden platters, offering it to their body.

Upon seeing the immortal officials, they bow and receive it, then consume it, tasting its bitterness. They wipe their eyes, swallow *qi* nine times, and cease. After three years of this, they will perceive the eight directions with penetrating vision, scrutinizing the hidden and probing the void. Seated, they will see without limit, their body light and luminous, dwelling in the mysterious emptiness.

The Way of summoning the true is most profound and difficult to declare. It is transmitted mouth to mouth; it must not be committed to writing.

Still maintaining the above method of visualization, inwardly perceive your body so clearly that you behold the palaces of the Nine Heavens, the mountains and rivers, forests and trees, flying dragons and running beasts, and the boundless edges of the cloudy horizon. There you meet with the host of perfected beings, conversing with the assembled immortals in perfect clarity. If the vision is not clear, continue the practice until it becomes distinct.

Then you will hear within your ears the sounds of the five tones and chiming jade, as if they could truly be heard. After a long while, you will see the immortal officials of the Central Marchmount, riding a flying chariot drawn by rosy clouds and dragons, accompanied by twelve jade maidens in flying yellow brocade skirts, bearing five-colored floral banners. They carry the Five Sacred Fungi and cinnabar essence in golden platters, offering them to your body.

Upon seeing the immortal officials, bow and receive them, then consume them, tasting their sweetness. Wipe your eyes, swallow *qi* twelve times, and cease. The Way of summoning the perfected to its utmost is a sublime method beyond words. After three years of practice, you will penetrate the hidden and void, clearly perceiving the mysterious darkness, calculating lifespan and fortune. All omens of good and ill will be thoroughly understood within your body, and your face will radiate jade-like light.

It is transmitted mouth to mouth; it must not be committed to writing. Once the visualization of the five directions is complete, rise and sit facing east, knocking the teeth nine times. Recite the prayer:

*"The myriad transformations arise in chaos,
The dark net governs the void.
The turning wheel makes no sound,
Yet revolves through the four directions.
Its radiance flows for ten thousand miles,
Penetrating the empty and boundless.
The Three Clarities’ precious brilliance,
Flying rosy clouds fill the chambers.
The morning essence infuses the dark,
The nine apertures open and flow.
Four convergences, eight reaches,
Abide in emptiness to summon the formless.
Grant me divine wisdom,
To clearly discern good and ill.
I mount the dark chariot,
Green canopy soaring through the dark.
Ascending to the Great Dawn,
I advance to worship the Jade Emperor."*

When the inner visualization of summoning the perfected and penetrating vision is complete, and the celestial rites are observed, the wondrous efficacy of this practice will be immediately evident, surpassing all other methods. Focus your mind solely on the Central Marchmount; after a hundred days of secluded practice, faint signs will begin to appear. After three years, the divine and true will be thoroughly illuminated, nothing obscured, nothing forgotten. This is the rarity of summoning the true from the formless, causing the true to descend.

This Way is subtle and profound, beyond worldly discourse, and thus transmitted only mouth to mouth, never committed to writing. Men value rank and position; I value this Way. Throughout the four seas, I have never heard of anyone exchanging this method for another. This is the root of undying life. Through it, you will foresee the unseen, penetrate the hidden and void, gaze upward into the boundless, and hear clearly for ten thousand miles. Its sublime wonders pervade all marvels under heaven—what could surpass it?

Those who attain it will mount the green canopy, soaring with a dark parasol of rosy clouds, ascending to the imperial abode of the Emperor. Guard this treasure in secrecy. Beware of reckless disclosure, for violating the covenant will bring retribution upon yourself and your nine generations of ancestors, consigning them to endless servitude. Your body will sink into the dark springs, enduring the trials of the Three Officials. Heed this warning well.

Receive the Purple Scripture of the Blazing Light, cultivate the practice of abiding in the true, and master the Way of summoning the perfected and penetrating vision. Always practice in a secluded chamber, free from worldly affairs. In stillness, visualize the lands beyond ten thousand miles in all four directions—the mountains and rivers, forests and trees, marshes and grasses, birds and beasts, peoples of all tribes, the aged and the foreign, all coming to bow before you.

Further visualize the fiery light streaming from your eyes like shooting stars, blazing and radiant, its brilliance filling the ten thousand miles beyond. The mountains and marshes, the Huai and Ji rivers, forests and trees—all dissolve in its light, leaving the heavens pure and bright, free from dust and filth. Your gaze will reach the boundless realm, penetrating all without obstruction, every detail clear and distinct.

Then knock the teeth nine times and recite the prayer while looking upward:

*"The dark light shines within,
Penetrating the boundless.
Subtle vision, far hearing,
The nine portals open wide.
Essence flows in surging streams,
Ten thousand miles made clear.
Seated, I perceive the natural,
Discerning good and ill in reverse.
I mount the flying rosy clouds,
Ascending to the great void."*

Conclude by drawing in *qi* and swallowing saliva seven times. If you cultivate this Way, faint signs will appear within a hundred days. After three years, your eyes will perceive the empty and boundless, seated you will see beyond ten thousand miles, and your ears will hear to the farthest reaches. This is the most sublime Way, not to be transmitted in writing but only mouth to mouth. Those who steal it will be struck by the wind-knife, their souls perishing without rebirth, and their nine generations of ancestors bound to serve as ghostly officials. Beware, beware.

*The Supreme Scripture of the Limitless Salvation, Great Method, Scroll Sixteen*
**Chapter on Suppressing Demonic Trials**

The Mysterious Master said: When scholars practice penetrating vision, they often encounter disturbances from demonic hosts, leading to the collapse of their efforts. If you see a beautiful immortal consort, do not gaze too long, for they may be officials of the Three Bureaus or the Five Emperors, jade lads and maidens sent to examine your merit. There are also pure and cunning demonic legions that transform to delude you. They may appear as ghosts or monsters, manifesting a hundred kinds of demonic trials to prevent the completion of your great work. Even the obstruction of family and relatives stems from demonic influence, seeking to halt your progress midway.

Constantly recite the *Middle Chapter of the Scripture of the Primordial Beginning* and the *Great Mantra of the Five Heavenly Demon Kings*—from the Demon King of the Azure Heavens to the *Shangqing* litanies of the ranked immortals, as well as the *Hymns of the Three Realms’ Demon Kings*—to suppress demonic trials and prevent wavering resolve. After a hundred days of accumulating a hundred thousand recitations, enter seclusion to practice penetrating vision. First recite the *Divine Mantra of the Golden Portal and the Mysterious Origin Lord*, which destroys ninety kinds of heterodox paths and one hundred eighty kinds of great demonic wisdom. Then summon the Jade Maiden Who Discerns Demons to distinguish truth from falsehood.

Inscribe the *Five Directions’ Demon-Dispelling Talismans* on banners and hold them in the five directions. Only then may you penetrate the hundred spirits and clearly perceive the ten directions. When your merit is complete and your practice fulfilled, your name will be recorded in the Jade Clarity, granting you long life and enduring vision. The heavenly demons will bow in submission, and the myriad spirits will pay homage. The Three Officials will select you for promotion, elevating you to the rank of Perfected.

If you harbor lust, jealousy, or malice, or engage in slander and collusion, if you begin with diligence but end in laziness, gradually abandoning your former efforts, you will be consigned to serve as a ghostly official, bringing calamity upon your nine generations of ancestors. Beware, beware.

The Demon-Dispelling Wisdom Mantra states:

Heaven and Earth’s mixed qi gives rise to all demons and perverse spirits.
Always with the upright Dao, dispel the baleful influences.
First contemplate: no self, no master.
All dharmas are empty, without mutual transformation.
The One True Realm—flying demons and ghosts.
Know their dwelling places, truly know the expedient means.
Through provisional emptiness and existence, the nature of dharma and principle.
Limpid and ever-abiding, without going or coming.
First, know the real; second, know the demonic;
third, eliminate appearances; fourth, discern emptiness.
*Qian,亨,li,zhen*—the perverse cannot encroach upon the upright.
"Those who face battle array themselves before the ranks."
Hasten, hasten, as the Emperor’s law commands!

For this method, first strike the teeth twelve times, then recite silently without regard to repetitions. All demons will instantly generate good thoughts and bow their heads at your seat. If you wish to eradicate them, recite extensively through many repetitions; the demons will flee in disarray, dissolving in accordance with the mantra.

When the Dao is accomplished, the Black Emperor will summon them. Wear it with utmost sincerity to forever dispel misfortune.

**Yellow Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Perfected Spirit Talisman**

On a *wu-ji* day of the four seasons, write in red on yellow silk and place it in the center to repel the ten thousand calamities, ensuring boundless protection, summoning auspicious omens, and bringing abundance and peace to all things. Those who study the Dao and wear it at the proper time will, after three years, generate a yellow jade essence within the spleen palace, its radiance illuminating their form. When the Dao is accomplished, the Yellow Emperor will summon them. Wear it with utmost sincerity to forever dispel misfortune.

**Purification and Cleansing**
When establishing an oratory for *dongshi* practice, first observe a period of fasting and abstinence. On the appointed day, invite the master to open the oratory and prepare twelve portions of incense, tea, wine, and fruit to offer to the celestial officials of the registers. Only then may you begin the practice. Thereafter, avoid attending funerals, entering birthing chambers, pigsties, battlefields, or execution grounds, and witnessing the slaughter of animals or the mating of livestock. If relatives encounter auspicious or inauspicious events, follow the *Upper Clarity Golden Root Precious Scripture* to refine and deliver their souls, enabling transcendence. Then bathe to purify yourself before re-entering the oratory to continue the practice. If unavoidable circumstances arise and you inadvertently violate the celestial prohibitions or encounter defilement, you must perform penance by suspending practice for twenty-four days. Afterward, bathe and re-enter the oratory to resume the practice. If, during the practice, chickens, dogs, monks, nuns, pregnant women, or defiled persons violate the altar’s sanctity, all prior merit will be forfeited, and the defiler will face annihilation. Should this occur, immediately burn incense, approach the altar, remove your headscarf, kowtow, and slap your cheeks twenty-four times. Then prostrate and recite:

The Ten Directions’ Great Compassionate Savior of Suffering Heavenly Worthy,
The Great One Savior of Suffering Heavenly Worthy,
The Three Sovereigns’ Inner Secret Names—hundreds of repetitions,
and the Purifying Water Mantra to dissolve defilement.

Recite the *Heaven and Earth Purification Mantra*, sprinkle the purifying water, and avert harm to people and things. After three days, you may resume the practice. Each day at dawn, take a bowl of water, recite the mantra, face north to absorb qi, and blow it into the water. Swallow the talisman with the water, then use it to cleanse your body. The mantra states:

The Celestial River pours into the Eastern Well,
The essence of stone and water-mother’s spirit.
The qi of the Five Directions flourishes and waxes,
Congealing into the form of a flowery canopy.
It restrains the hun-soul and governs the seven po,
With a single washing, the Five Turbidities become pure.

**True Talisman for Dissolving Defilement**
Mantra states:
The immortals bathe in fragrant qi,
Washing away all foulness to make it vanish.
The sun serves as general, the moon as marshal,
Commanding my eyes to see all without obstruction.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.

Write the talisman in cinnabar: first inscribe three "sun" characters, then the name of the Dipper, and recite the mantra seven times. Upon completion, swallow one talisman. Next, pour half the water onto the ground and step over it. The mantra states:
Treading this water of the Three Clarities,
Washing away the mud of the Five Turbidities.
The body soars into the realm of formlessness,
Irrigating the celestial pools above.

Once the dissolution of defilement is complete, you may enter the oratory to perform the practice of penetrating vision and the great methods of the Dao.

**Daily Observances for Cultivation**
Each night after the hour of *zi*, rise from bed, face south, drape your robe, and sit. With both hands, form the Five Emperors’ mudra of the red apricot, and click your teeth thirty-two times. Visualize your heart as General Tang, your left kidney as General Ge, and your right kidney as General Zhou. The Four Numinous Generals stand at your left, right, front, and back. The Azure Dragon emerges from the liver and stands to your left, the White Tiger from the lungs and stands to your right, the Vermilion Bird from the heart and stands before you, and the Dark Warrior from the kidneys and stands behind you. General Tang emerges from the numinous crimson palace of the heart, General Ge from the left mysterious palace of the left kidney, and General Zhou from the mysterious origin palace of the right kidney, each leading eighty thousand troops and cavalry, arrayed to your left and right.

Bow in your heart thirty-two times, and click your teeth thirty-two times, visualizing the thirty-two Heavenly Sovereign Lords. The secret mantra states:
Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord,
Summon forth the Three and Five Merit Officers within my body,
The attendants of the left and right, the incense-bearing golden youths,
The jade maidens who transmit words, the direct talismans of the Five Emperors,
The incense officials of the day—thirty-six each—emerge and follow my command.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Celestial Venerable decrees.

Next, visualize three Fire Star officials of the south in crimson robes, returning to the heart in red light. Nine Wood Virtue Star officials of the east in azure robes return to the liver in green light. Seven Metal Star officials of the west in white robes return to the lungs in white light. Five Water Star officials of the north in black robes return to the kidneys in black light. Twelve Earth Star officials of the center in yellow robes return to the spleen in yellow light. The three hun-souls and seven po-souls, along with the thirty-six thousand spirits, all reside within the body. The mantra states:
The hun-souls become clear and upright,
The ten thousand qi eternally endure.
Unburdened by suffering and affliction,
The body radiates light.
The Three Realms provide escort,
The Five Emperors oversee reception.
The myriad spirits pay homage,
My name is inscribed in the Upper Clarity.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Celestial Venerable decrees.

Next, visualize the sun on your left and the moon on your right, with the stars arrayed above. Gradually, ascend through the Heavenly Gate into the Mysterious Terrace Palace and the Crimson Tower Palace, penetrating within and without, illuminating the entire chamber. Upon completion, visualize the Yellow Elder Lord in purple robes seated in the Central Yellow Palace below the navel. The Unsurpassed Noble Scion in purple Daoist robes resides on the left, and the White Prime Honored Spirit in white robes resides on the right. Guard this vision, allowing the qi to flow continuously. Inhale through the nose, keeping the mouth closed to prevent leakage, and circulate it gently to ascend to the Upper Clarity.

Next, visualize the green qi of the left kidney as a streak of green light traveling along the left spine to the back of the brain, entering the left eye and passing through to the right eye. Then visualize the black qi of the right kidney transforming into purple light, traveling along the right spine to the back of the brain and entering the left eye. The mantra states:
The two eyes, talismans of water and ink,
True qi enters the eyes, penetrating the formless.
Gazing through the Three Realms,
True immortals share the path.

Circulate the right and left eyes nine times each to perform penetrating vision.

**Daily Practices for Penetrating Vision**
Upon waking at night, immediately close your eyes. Click your teeth nine times and swallow saliva nine times. Then, press the left and right sides of the nose ten times with your hands. The mantra states:
The Four Luminaries of the Most High,
The essence of the Nine Gates’ method.
Ears and eyes profoundly clear,
Communing with the true and reaching the numinous.
The Mysterious Terrace in the heavens,
Flowing qi harmonized and balanced.
The Cloudy Maiden’s graceful bearing,
The pupils of the eyes bright and keen.
Radiant clarity and brilliance,
A hundred visions distant and clear.
Preserving harmony in the Upper Origin,
Wandering the Nine Citadels.
The five viscera rooted,
Ears and eyes naturally arise.
The Heavenly Terrace’s lush purity,
Pillars and beams unshaken.
The seven po refined and tempered,
The three hun at peace.
The Red Child carries the light,
Ever at my side.
Should any dare obstruct my ears and eyes,
The Most High shall smite them with the flowing bell.
All myriad evils vanish,
Every wish is fulfilled.
The sun and moon guard the gates,
The heart harbors the Five Stars.
As the True Sovereign invokes,
Let all listen with reverence.

Upon completion, swallow green saliva into the liver nine times. Rub your face until it becomes slightly warm. Make this a regular practice. Perform this ritual upon waking, never omitting a single night. It sharpens hearing and vision, strengthens memory and clarity, balances the nose, prevents spittle and nasal mucus, restores a youthful complexion, governs the hun and records the po, and repels all demons.

**Another Method**
First, press the two hollows at the inner corners of the eyebrows twenty-seven times. Use both hands to press gently, then firmly with the middle fingers. The incantation states:

"Unlock the Heavenly Court,
Granting me eternal life.
Pierce through vision for ten thousand miles,
Let hun and po return to infancy.
Banish ghosts and repel demons,
Summon a thousand spirits.
Ascend to the Supreme,
Merge with the sun as one.
Attain the rank of Perfected,
Inscribed in the Register of the Mysterious.

**Another Method**
After ingesting the Jade Script, first press and then rub. With fingers and palms, wipe the eyes. Bring both hands together atop the crown, repeating twenty-seven times. Visualize azure, violet, and crimson qi emerging before your eyes.

Recite again:
'Triple Clouds of the Eye Youth,
True Lords of the Two Eyes.
Radiant brilliance infuses essence,
Unlocking and purifying the spirit.
Supreme Cloud Visage,
Spiritual maidens dance lightly.
Guard the twin gates,
Open and penetrate the nine portals.
All joints respond in harmony,
Morning fluid ascends to the Mud Pill Palace.
The body ascends to the Jade Palace,
Ennobled as an Upper Perfected.
Should any obscure my ears and eyes,
The Supreme shall shatter them with flowing bells.
Pierce through vision for ten thousand miles,
Clearly perceive ghosts and spirits.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statute decrees.'

Perform this at the zi and wu hours, or practice it regularly. It sharpens the ears and brightens the eyes.

Grasp the upper joint of the middle finger with both hands. For each incantation recited thrice, inhale northern qi and blow onto the palms (the area below the thumb is the palm). Press the palms to the eyes, then to the back of the head. Repeat this, reciting the incantation thrice. As before, inhale northern qi, exhale onto the palms, press them to the eyes, then recite the incantation nine times. Blow into water, and with the middle finger, drip the water into the eyes—once daily.

**Penetrating Vision for Document Review**
For reviewing, reporting, or examining documents, first write on paper:
'The sky is free of floating haze,
The Four Qi are bright and clear.
Dark wisdom illuminates purity,
Luminous qi soars in four directions with four talismans.'

While writing, visualize the Jade Capital Mountain in the southeast, towering millions of zhang, with the sun and moon shining brightly and the stars gleaming. Form the Jade Purity mudra, inhale qi, and blow onto the brush. Recite one character as you write one, layering them into a talisman. Cast it into water and wash the eyes. If unable to write the talisman, take pure earth from the ground, recite the incantation fifteen times, and mix the earth into water. Stir until clear, then wash the eyes.

Place the document to be reviewed under the open sky, burn incense, and invoke the attending spirit officials and jade maidens. Form the mudra again, recite the Jade Tone Qi-Gathering Incantation, blow onto the document, recite the names of the Five Emperors, and inhale eastern qi to blow upon it. You must be able to perceive the text. If the paper appears veiled in azure, the true qi has descended. If not, recite the incantation again until it turns azure.

Then recite the incantation nine times:
'Formless yet luminous,
True qi arises spontaneously.
Red-script Jade Characters,
Eight Mighty Dragon Scripts.
Preserve and govern the kalpa,
Ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance.
Brahma qi pervades the cosmos,
Ten thousand Brahma realms open.
Inhale the qi of the Heavenly Gate and blow onto the paper. Observe whether the text is distinct.

Jade Tone gathers qi,
Spiritual winds amass mist.
Purple emptiness flourishes,
Aiding the myriad immortals.
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions,
Naturally attaining perfection.
Chaotic Crimson Script,
Peerless Upper Perfected.
From the Primordial Ancestral Kalpa,
All heavens are transformed.
The Three Luminaries unfold,
Becoming the root of heaven.
Above, there is no further ancestor,
Only the Dao as body.
Five Scripts expand,
Universally planting divine spirits.
Without script, no illumination;
Without script, no clarity.
Without script, no establishment;
Without script, no completion.
Without script, no deliverance;
Without script, no generation.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Sovereign of Heaven decrees.'

Inhale the qi of the Heavenly Gate and blow onto the paper. Observe:

For beginners with one or two-tenths of vision, the text may appear as if through an insect’s burrow—obscured or faintly rising. With three-tenths of vision, the characters resemble raised plaques, each stroke elevated on both sides with a channel-like depression in the center, containing faint ink traces. With four-tenths of vision, the traces appear as pale ink. With five-tenths, the traces turn azure, pale pink, pale yellow, or faint ink. Spiritual qi swirls above the paper. Beyond five-tenths, red hues gradually appear. At full vision, yellow predominates.

If the strokes remain indistinct, recite the incantation and blow again until the text matches the described clarity, avoiding disorder. Only then is it acceptable. Then recite the 'Without script, no illumination' incantation. If the text appears black, recite the 'Without script, no clarity' incantation and inhale qi until the strokes are half-visible and half-hidden, discernible enough to trace. If still unclear, recite the incantation, blow, and wash the eyes while invoking the spirit officials, jade maidens, and divine tigers.

Initially, strive to discern the strokes, stopping after ten or twenty characters to avoid greed. Gradually increase by ten or so characters daily, ensuring vision does not regress. Deterioration often stems from tracing too many characters when fatigued, leading to misrecognition, errors in writing, and chaotic true qi. The text may resemble insect burrows, plaque channels, or bird tracks, becoming unstable and harming vision. Heavenly script is formed by true qi—exercise utmost caution.

After one hundred to two hundred ke without vision decline, stabilize it before progressing. First recite the Five Directions Incantation, write the Five Talismans (the Five Meritorious Talismans of the Numinous Treasure), and swallow them. On yin and yang days, ingest the Jade Tablet to enhance vision further.

**Entering the Chamber to Assume Duties**
Before entering the chamber each day, recite the Entry Incantation:
'Luminous Scribes of the Four Brightnesses,
Messengers of the True Transmission.
Jade Maidens of Serene Attendance,
Jade Lads of Proclamation.
Convey my words,
To the deities of the Dao chamber.
Upper Prime Qi,
Enter my body.
Let all I declare
Be heard above.'
Silently.'

Upon completion, strike the teeth twelve times and enter the chamber with the right foot first. Before the sacred presence, strike the teeth nine times, perform nine bows, and with the left hand thrice offer incense. Recite:

"Jade radiance scatters light,
Nine qi abide in smoke.
Fragrant clouds densely woven,
Ascend to the Nine Heavens.
Incense-attending Golden Lad,
Message-bearing Jade Maiden.
Heard above before the Emperor,
Let all I declare
Be granted as spoken."

Thereafter, offer prayers as the heart desires. Step into the Dipper’s mouth, perform nine bows while kneeling, and present the secret memorial. From the beginning, invoke and pray to the immortal officials of the registers and methods concerned. Proclaim universally:

"Once you await my audience with the perfected complete,
As I enter the chamber to attend to affairs,
You must manifest clearly,
Reporting and responding without fail."

Upon concluding the prayer, visualize the immortal officials all present at your sides. Only then form the mudra and proceed in proper sequence. According to yin and yang days, swallow the Jade Tablet and wash the eyes. Then sit upright, lean upon the desk, and ingest the *Tongmu Dongshi* (Penetrating Eye and Pervading Vision) talisman, as well as the *Shezhao* (Summoning) talisman.

Place a sheet of paper before you, fold it into three pieces, and divide them over three days. For instance, if today is the seventh day of the seventh month and you enter the chamber, it is fitting that texts descend from Heaven, while deities of the middle and lower realms present official matters. If immortal officials submit reports or request rulings, the presiding *Jing* immortal officer, spirit officials, and jade maidens in charge will annotate them. After a while, clearly visualize each detail above the incense. Shortly after, recite the incantation of the *Dongshi* method, inhale the azure-colored and white-bodied textual dew, enunciate the incantation distinctly, and transcribe each character to examine the matters at hand.

Await the evening audience to deliberate and conclude affairs in the *Jing* chamber. Recite the Exit Incantation:

"Emerging from yin into yang,
Myriad spirits open wide.
Matters concluded, gates sealed,
The Yellow Chamber now closed.
Jade Maidens of Serene Attendance,
Brightly prepare the divine carriage."

Upon finishing the incantation, exit the chamber, stepping first with the left foot, and do not look back. To look back invites perverse qi, and what was presented will not reach its destination. First perform nine bows, holding the breath while bowing. Upon rising, exit without looking back, for to do so offends the true qi. Do not tread upon the threshold, do not let the stove’s fire extinguish, and never blow upon the incense with the mouth—these are Heaven’s great prohibitions, and violations incur corporal punishment.

Discuss the annotated matters with masters and peers for thorough deliberation. If unresolved, further annotations must be sought while awaiting responses, to be concluded in the evening audience.

*The Great Rites of the Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation, Volume Sixteen* concludes.
*The Great Rites of the Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation, Volume Seventeen* begins.

**The Supreme Chapter on the Wearing of the Inner Sounds**

At that time, during the Primordial Radiance of the Red Clarity Era, the Most High commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to transmit the true methods of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens, thereby pacifying and securing the myriad heavens, establishing the firmament and the earth, regulating the stars and constellations, and founding the sun and moon. The myriad heavens and all the myriad sages, together with the ten thousand kinds and ten thousand things, all receive their completion from the numinous treasures of the Most High, and only by receiving the true *qi* of the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning do they attain generation and transformation. Each follows its inherent nature to receive its name.

This method can deliver the myriad spirits of heaven and earth, as well as all the holy assemblies who have attained the Dao. All are endowed with the true method of the Inner Sounds and the *qi* of the great prohibitions, thereby accomplishing the great Dao. Should one encounter this orthodox method of the great Dao of the Inner Sounds, one will invariably ascend on high. It is said that all the great sages attain sagehood through the true method of the Inner Sounds.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign said: Above in the heavens and below on earth, this sound pervades all, dispels all, delivers all, and accomplishes all. This is the spontaneous sound of the Heavenly Perfected, known as the true method of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens, which naturally establishes the heavens and the earth. When encountering this method, one must align above with heaven, below with earth, and in the center with humanity. Furthermore, one must act with perfect propriety, speak without harming others, and practice the way of self-sacrifice to save all beings. Only through such cultivation may one practice the true method of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens and thereby attain the way of ascending on high.

It is said that the luminaries of the myriad heavens, the emperors, kings, and sages all ascend to the ranks of the immortals through the true method of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens. This method is wondrous and weighty, and its merits are equal to those of heaven. It is the treasure of the heavens for delivering humanity and is not transmitted to the lower world—such is the method of the Inner Sounds. Thus, it is known that the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning transmits it to the lower world once every forty thousand kalpas.

This clarifies that the eight meritorious upper sounds are all the ancestral models of the heavens. It elucidates that this sound is the method for ascending to heaven. Thus, it is the root of entering sagehood and the gate of long life, the path to the heavens above. Moreover, should one encounter this method in ten thousand kalpas, one’s entire being will attain the Dao and ascend to heaven, and one will further deliver the nine ancestral lineages and the seven generations of ancestors, all of whom will attain the way of divine transcendence.

It is said that this method, in heaven above and among humanity below, enables all the sages, worthies, and true spirits to attain the way of the lofty perfected. This sound delivers an immeasurable number of beings, serving as the ancestral origin of the myriad ways. Those who attain the Dao and become perfected are as numerous as raindrops in a mist, and their merits and calculations are beyond reckoning.

It is further likened thus: Just as the Son of Heaven in the human realm confers ranks upon the myriad officials, and without the Son of Heaven, none may attain office, so too do the true sages of the myriad heavens, without the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning, have no means to attain the Dao. It is said that this method will reside in the world for four million years before descending again to the human realm. Should one encounter this method, one will traverse the Three Realms alone, ascend through the Golden Gate, and share the same lifespan as heaven. All the true methods of the jade formulas of the Inner Sounds of the Numinous Treasure Heavens are listed as follows.

**The Eight Assembled Sounds of the Nine *Qi* of the Azure Heavens of the East**
**The Supreme Yellow Emperor’s Layered Heaven**
The first, second, and third characters of the Layered Heaven are inscribed facing upward upon the Tower of the Dark Capital, their texts establishing the measurements of heaven and earth, and summoning the great spirits of the ten directions. The fourth and fifth characters are inscribed facing upward upon the southern pavilion of the Emperor’s Wandering Terrace, generating spontaneous divine perfected beings within the realm of emptiness and non-being. The sixth, seventh, and eighth characters are inscribed upon the gate of the sun and moon, illuminating the nine dark realms and opening the repository of the long night. Each character is one *zhang* square, with eight luminous corners.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign said: To cultivate the way of flying transcendence, on the tenth day of the lunar month, inscribe in cinnabar the first, second, and third characters of the Layered Heaven, wear them facing the kingly direction, and recite the incantation according to the method. After one hundred days, the myriad spirits will pay homage to you. On the fifteenth and thirtieth days of the lunar month, inscribe in cinnabar the fourth and fifth characters, wear them facing the kingly direction, and recite the incantation according to the method. After twenty-four years of wearing them, divine perfected beings will be generated within you, and both in life and death, you will ascend to the Emperor’s Wandering Terrace. On the days of the waxing and waning crescents and the full moon, inscribe in cinnabar the sixth, seventh, and eighth characters, and wear them facing the moon. After eight years, light will emanate from within your body, your face will assume a golden hue, and both in life and death, you will ascend to the palace of the sun and moon, undergo refinement, and become an immortal.

By wearing these texts, the Three Offices will no longer record your transgressions, and your name will be inscribed in the Layered Heaven. Through the cycles of life and death, you will endure for kalpas without end. This method is wondrous and weighty, and its merits are equal to those of heaven.

**The Great Clarity Jade Perfection Heaven**
The first and second characters of the Jade Perfection Heaven are inscribed together upon the northwestern watchtower of heaven, governing the kalpic cycles of heaven and earth. The third and fourth characters are inscribed upon the jade fan of the gate of the Three Realms, marking the beginning of their division and measurement. The fifth and sixth characters are inscribed upon the upper palace of the Purple Tenuity, governing the realm of retribution and opening the gate of life and death. The seventh and eighth characters are inscribed within the Dark Northern Dipper, governing the regulation of the celestial passes and the revolutions of the heavenly wheels. All celestial inscriptions are one *zhang* square, with eight luminous corners, within the Jade Perfection Heaven.

Great Brahmā of Flying Heavens, Vairambha of the Eight Directions,
Nine Qi of the Pure Heavens, all gathered as Divine Kings.
Five Unions and Eight Assemblies, flowing and radiant through the Great Void,
Above connecting to the Dragon Han, the ancestral lineage of divine immortals.
Below delivering from the long night, the chambers of the Nine Dark Realms.
Rescuing suffering souls, decayed bones emit light,
The body transforms into feathers, clad in five-colored garments.
Azure dragons and jade chariots, soaring through the empty sky.
Today I make this supplication to the Blue Heaven of Primordial Yang.
May the myriad beings harmonize, merging with qi as one.
Ascending into the formless, eternally preserved without end.

After reciting, ingest the text, face upward, and swallow the eight qi. Cease.

Below delivering from life and death, all who receive form.
Today is most auspicious, the Great Sage descends to the court.
The Nine Nights open their windows, the dark chambers bright and clear.
The Three Evils cease, my Dao naturally fulfills.
The Five Emperors safeguard and deliver, ascending to the Flourishing Capital.
Within the Seven Jeweled Grove, eternally enjoying kalpas of longevity.

After reciting, ingest the text, face upward, and swallow the eight qi. Cease.

Wandering souls disperse, receiving qi to ascend to the Mysterious.
Today’s time is most felicitous, ten thousand vows unfold.
Hosts of perfected beings converge—my wish, my immortality.
Radiance merges with the Dao—my wish, my spirit.
Attaining the white clouds, ascending to the imperial throne.
Amidst the Seven Jeweled Joy, befriending the perfected.
Cease.

Unsealing the pardon to reveal the script, bestowing upon me the true text.
Jade moisture intermingles, the Five Palaces engender the true.
Feathers and plumage transform, mounting radiance to ride the imperial throne.
Emerging from darkness into the formless, immortal deliverance is natural.
Seven ancestors return together, rejoicing in the Upper Prime.
Cease.
Ingest the text, face upward, and swallow the eight qi. Stop.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declares: These incantations and recitations are the qi of the Four Convergences, the harmonies of the Eight Accords, the spontaneous compositions.
Those who practice them find the heavens afar chanting in response, the Three Realms arraying rites, myriad spirits girding their sashes to attend and guard the numinous text, following the seasons in service and recitation. After a hundred days, the heavens record their deeds, and the earthly officials erase their names from the ledgers.
After eight years, divine perfected beings descend of their own accord, the body born with jadelike radiance, penetrating the dark and empty. Seated, one beholds the spontaneous, the gate of death revives, the womb returns to humanity, the wheel ceases not, and in life and death one attains immortality.
The Dao is august, the Dharma wondrous—one practice endures for forty thousand kalpas.
To lightly divulge or neglect it is to bear the wind-blade of the River Source, never attaining immortality even after ten thousand kalpas.
The ancient statutes of the enlightened are clear: this must be kept secret.

The Great Method of the *Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation*, Scroll Nineteen.

**The Chapter of the Five Cloud Sprouts**

The Five Chapters of the Vermilion Writ of the Primordial Beginning arose within the Great Void. Before heaven and earth shone with light, before the dawn of creation, the hidden root of the original took form. The Three Radiances were established, the Five Qi were born, and the Five Colors divided their splendor, illuminating the Five Directions. The Five Thearchs were set in place, yin and yang guided their course, the pivot of the Nine Heavens turned, and the brilliance of the Five Stars revolved. The Five Marchmounts were planted to secure and pacify, and the Five Palaces nurtured the spirits.

Thus, the perfected of the utmost truth constantly rely upon the first light of yang’s dawn, drawing down the upright qi of the Primordial Beginning, channeling the Jade Spring to flow with fragrance, and summoning the original essence to the Supreme Ultimate. They beckon the Five Thearchs to the numinous youths. Those who cultivate and irrigate do not decline; those who preserve and guard know no end. They turn back ten thousand kalpas to renew the beginning, safeguarding the Five Sprouts within their countenance. Truly, this is the wondrous secret of the Numinous Treasure, the joyous veneration of the myriad sages.

**The Jade Instructions of the Primordial Beginning’s Vermilion Writ: Ingesting the Azure Sprout and Guiding the Nine Qi of the Azure Heaven**

The method for cultivating the Azure Sprout and guiding the Nine Qi of the Azure Heaven of the East:

Always, on the day of the Beginning of Spring at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face east, and bow nine times. Sit upright, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the Azure Numinous Beginning Elder Lord of the Eastern Peaceful Treasure Flower Grove, surnamed Yan, named Kai Ming, styled Ling Wei Yang. His form is nine inches tall, his head crowned with an azure essence-jade coronet, his body clad in a flying robe of the Nine Qi’s azure feathers. He rides a chariot drawn by a blue-green dragon, bearing a banner of plumes, attended by ninety myriad Lords of the Jia-Yi Hu-Lao, descending from the Nine Qi Azure Heaven into the chamber.

Presently, azure qi transforms and arises, dense as the mist of distant clouds, enveloping one’s form. It enters through the mouth and descends directly into the liver palace. Then, visualize Jupiter blazing brightly in the east, its light illuminating one’s body, all made distinct.

Upon completion, open the eyes and raise the gaze, praying:

*"Nine Qi Azure Heaven, primordial essence on high.
August Elder, divine lord, clad in azure feathers.
Commanding the celestial palace, Jupiter shines resplendent.
Scattering radiance, flowing fragrance, cleansing my form.
Feasting on dawn’s aurora, ingesting and guiding wood’s essence.
Firmly nurturing the Azure Sprout, securing against decay.
The liver palace overflows, jade mushrooms sprout of themselves.
Turning back years by the myriad kalpas, countenance returns to youth.
Five Qi merge as one, heaven and earth endure together."*

When finished, guide the azure qi and swallow it nine times, then cease. Proceed to ingest the twelve Vermilion Writ jade characters of the east.

These twelve characters are the names of the Nine Qi Azure Heaven, guiding the Nine Qi of the Azure Thearch and ingesting the Azure Sprout. All are written in vermilion on white paper, visualized and then swallowed whole. Thus, the Nine Qi descend unbidden, the Azure Thearch responds in voice and manifests form, the Five Sprouts are fortified upon the Eastern Marchmount, the liver palace’s jade mushrooms sprout of themselves, and the numinous youths align the true writ beside one’s resting place. Azure lads come to assist and command, and after nine years of accumulated resonance and transformation, one instantly becomes a divine immortal, transcending the world for ten thousand kalpas without end.

Always, at cock’s crow when the yang light first divides, face east, click the teeth nine times, rub the hands until warm, and with the palms wipe the face and eyes nine times. Raise the gaze and pray:

*"Eastern Azure Sprout, ingesting the Azure Sprout,
drinking the dawn’s blossoms."*

When finished, with the tongue lick the inside of the upper teeth and the sweet lips three times, filling the mouth with Jade Spring, and swallow it three times. Then guide the azure qi and swallow it nine times, causing it to settle within the liver. This completes the method.

**The Jade Instructions of the Primordial Beginning’s Vermilion Writ: Ingesting the Vermilion Sprout and Guiding the Three Qi of the Cinnabar Heaven**

The method for cultivating the Vermilion Sprout and guiding the Three Qi of the Cinnabar Heaven of the South:

Always, on the day of the Beginning of Summer at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face south, and bow three times. Sit upright, click the teeth three times, and visualize the Southern Flourishing Treasure Prosperous Cinnabar Numinous True Elder Lord, surnamed Dong Fu, named Ji Yan, styled Chi Biao Nu. His form is three inches tall, his head crowned with a vermilion kerchief and jade coronet, his body clad in a flying robe of the Three Qi’s cinnabar feathers. He rides a chariot drawn by a cinnabar dragon, bearing a vermilion banner, attended by thirty myriad officials of the Bing-Ding Yue-Lao, descending from the Three-Five Cinnabar Heaven into the chamber.

Presently, vermilion qi transforms and arises, blazing like the brilliance of fire, enveloping one’s form. It enters through the mouth and descends directly into the heart palace. Then, visualize Mars blazing brightly in the south, its light illuminating one’s body, all made distinct.

Upon completion, open the eyes and raise the gaze, praying:

*"Three Qi Cinnabar Heaven, vermilion palace’s numinous youth.
Primordial Beginning’s august elder, thrice riding the red dragon.
Cinnabar feathers in flight, brocade mantle’s radiance.
Driving and steering the celestial palace, revolving the Dao of yin and yang.
Three Qi exhale brilliance, irrigating my crimson palace.
The Red Child is preserved and secured, golden sprouts adorn the countenance.
Feasting on the vermilion dawn, jade mushrooms fill and overflow.
Halting the kalpas’ years, decayed bones return to youth.
Longevity of heaven and earth, eternally enjoying without end.
Body born of water and fire, transforming by the hundreds of thousands."*

When finished, guide the vermilion qi and swallow it three times, then ingest the twelve Vermilion Writ jade characters of the south.

These twelve characters are the names of the Three Qi Cinnabar Heaven. They guide the Three Qi of the Vermilion Thearch and ingest the Vermilion Sprout, all written in vermilion on white paper, visualized and then swallowed whole. Thus, the vermilion qi is guided to flow and overflow with fragrant mushrooms, pouring into the crimson palace. The Vermilion Thearch descends in truth to the visualization, receiving the vermilion writ from the numinous youths, preserving the Vermilion Sprout to endure forever, ingesting the Three Qi of Zhu Rong. The vermilion jade tablet flourishes to communicate with the numinous, revolving the Five Chapters to summon the spirits. Through long fasting and silent resonance in the Great Stillness, one’s name is inscribed in heaven above the southern window. Truly, this is effortlessly attained without difficulty, eternally enjoyed without end.

Always, at cock’s crow when the yang light first divides, face south, click the teeth three times, rub the hands until warm, and with the palms wipe the face and eyes three times. Raise the gaze and pray:

*"Southern Vermilion Cinnabar, ingesting the Vermilion Cinnabar,
drinking from the Cinnabar Pool."*

When finished, with the tongue lick the lower teeth and the sweet lips, rinsing the mouth until the jade mushrooms fill it, and swallow three times.

Then draw in the vermilion *qi* and swallow it three times, allowing it to settle within the Heart Palace. Thus the Dao is complete.

Twelve myriad attendants of the Wu-Ji Yue Lao officials descend from the twelve *qi* of the Yellow Heaven into the chamber. Soon, yellow *qi* transforms and surges forth, radiant as luminous clouds, enveloping one’s form and entering through the mouth to descend directly into the Spleen Palace. Then visualize the Earth Star blazing in the central sky, its light illuminating the body. Hold the vision clearly, then open the eyes and pray:

*"Central Yellow Mount Tai, the Primordial *Qi* lingers.
Above dwells the Primordial Elder, governing the Four Peaks.
Riding the yellow dragon, clad in five-colored feathered robes,
Guiding the Nine Heavens, revolving the celestial pivot.
The Earth Star blazes bright, scattering radiant light.
Jade blossoms and fragrant mushrooms fill the four directions.
They bathe my form, the Spleen Palace unfurls fresh.
Nurturing the sprout, ingesting essence, the myriad spirits converge.
Restraining the hun and po, refining the Eight Potencies,
Within and without, all becomes luminously clear, ever-living without decline.
Communing with the real, attaining the numinous, ascending into the Great Tenuity."*

When finished, draw in the yellow *qi* and swallow it twelve times. Cease. Then ingest the sixteen characters of the Central Vermilion Script’s jade text. These sixteen characters are the names of the Central Yellow Heaven. To guide the twelve *qi* of the Yellow Emperor and ingest the Yellow Sprout, write them in vermilion script on white paper, visualize them, and swallow them whole. Thus the Primordial *Qi* is drawn down from the Nine Heavens, and the Mystic Throat pours into the Wondrous Gate. The Granary of Heaven fills without grain, the Spleen Palace glows without kindling. The Elder responds in harmonious resonance, the Numinous Youth opens his robes to receive the script. The White Prime moves swiftly to command the east and west. Wondrous indeed is this jade formula, the origin of the myriad immortals.

His form stands seven inches tall, crowned with a white essence jade coronet, clad in white feathered flying robes, riding a white dragon, bearing a purple banner. Seventy myriad attendants of the Geng-Xin Xuan Lao officials descend from the seven *qi* of the White Heaven into the chamber. Soon, white *qi* transforms and billows forth, vast as autumn clouds veiling the sky, enveloping one’s form and entering through the mouth to descend directly into the Lung Palace. Then visualize the Metal Star blazing in the west, its light illuminating the body. Hold the vision clearly, then open the eyes and pray:

*"Golden Numinous Seven Gates, resplendent in the Western Flower.
Within dwells the White August One, the Primordial’s abode.
Riding the white dragon, the seven *qi* towering,
Lingering at the Jade Gate, scattering crimson radiance.
The Metal Star emits its glow, fragrant mushrooms flourish.
They bathe my form in mystery, nurturing my White Sprout.
The Bright Stone shines with fresh light, enduring through ten thousand kalpas.

Abiding long with heaven and earth, the Three Luminaries share eternity."*

When finished, draw in the white *qi* and swallow it seven times. Cease. Then ingest the twelve characters of the Western Vermilion Script’s jade text.

The method of guiding the five *qi* of the Black Emperor and ingesting the Mysterious Sprout is all written in vermilion script upon white paper; after completing the visualization, consume it at once. Thus, the Elder of the Mysterious is registered in the Vermilion Numinous Realm, the numinous youth’s name inscribed upon the Vermilion Script. The five *qi* flow with mushroom essence into the withered abode, jade springs surge in pools at the Central Gate. The spirit stabilizes the numinous marrow, the Kidney Palace generates warmth. The Jade Maidens of the Great Mystery are dispatched east and west, never waning through ten thousand kalpas, the Elder of the Mysterious abiding as one.

Always at cock’s crow, when yang light first divides, face north, click the teeth five times, rub the palms until warm, and wipe the face and eyes five times. Raise the gaze in prayer, saying:
*"Northern Dark Essence, ingest the Dark Essence, drink the Jade Elixir."*

Then, with the tongue, stroke the inner lower teeth, sweetening the lips and rinsing the mouth until Jade Mushrooms fill the mouth; swallow three times. Again, guide the black *qi* into the abdomen, allowing it to stabilize within the Kidney Palace. Thus, the Dao is complete.

Of old, the Dao spoke of the method of guiding and ingesting the sprout: always on the days of the eight solar terms, enter the chamber in purity and fast, visualize the forms of the Five Elders, and after reciting the incantations, guide and ingest the names of the heavens according to each direction. Practicing this for eight years, immortal officials will come to welcome you, jade maidens will attend as guards, and your body will radiate light, illuminating the ten directions. You will roam freely, the Five Emperors bowing in reverence, the Three Realms’ administrators coming to greet. This rank is the title of the Perfected of the Three Heavens.

This text is fully preserved within the Southern Garden’s Vermilion Grotto and Five Cities, guarded by the immortal officials of the Three Heavens. Twelve-tiered immortal towers house it in a coffer of purple jade, inscribed with golden tablets, adorned with cinnabar mushrooms and luminous herbs. It is transmitted alongside the Central Chapter of the Most High, conferred only upon those whose names are inscribed in the immortal registers of the Cinnabar Terrace, destined to become Perfected of the Second Heaven. Without this tally, one shall never attain it. According to the ancient statutes, it emerges once every four hundred years.

At the hour of the cock’s crow, compose the body and settle the spirit, then proceed in order. First ingest the verdant sprouting qi of the Eastern Quarter, then the Southern, then the Central, then the Western, then the Northern—once the Five Emperors’ qi has been received according to the method above, strike the teeth thirty-six times and swallow the qi twenty-five times, then cease.

Then recite the general incantation:
White rocks towering, one after another,
Fountains gushing, like jade nectar.
Drink of this and live forever,
Lifespan extended without end.

Once finished, stir the tongue against the upper and lower palate and center, filling the mouth with jade mushrooms, then swallow three times. Again draw in the qi twenty-five times, swallowing until the qi reaches its utmost, and the Dao is complete.

*The Wondrous Scripture of Limitless Salvation, Great Method of the Upper Scripture, Scroll Nineteen—End*
*The Wondrous Scripture of Limitless Salvation, Great Method of the Upper Scripture, Scroll Twenty: The Hidden Writ and Mysterious Image*

The Mysterious Master said: When Heaven and Earth first opened, the images of the Five Phases and Three Powers all took form and substance. That humans can fully embody the qi of Heaven and Earth yet cannot endure long is because they are open to transformation but cannot restrain their spirit, nurturing the qi of pure truth yet instead becoming prey to demonic and malevolent forces.

If one can cultivate the qi of Heaven, one may attain celestial perfection. If one cultivates the qi of the torch, it transforms into demonic spirits. This is easy to know but difficult to practice, easy to practice but difficult to articulate.

The Dao of long life and ascension is nothing other than attaining the Dao, yet those deluded remain mired in the realm of sensual desire. Though the *Hidden Writ of the Wondrous Treasure* speaks little, its practice is profound. To keep the pure qi from withering amid sensual desire and to clarify the turbid qi within the depths of sinking, one must await the flowing of the kalpa of Red Clarity. Those who study above surpass those below—none can attain it.

When our August Sovereign obtained it, floating in the void, he established images within the utmost essence. The sun, moon, and stellar lodgings, wind and rain, the four seasons—all reside within the upright qi. The *Biographies of the Jade Pivot* revolve day and night. If mortals can preserve the Dao of long life without entering the realm of cyclic rebirth, all is distinguished within the *Hidden Writ*, its chapters clearly delineated. Having glimpsed the gateway to the essential path of long life, one must ascend from the mundane to the sagely with ease.

Those who attain the rank of Upper Immortal thereby comprehend the mysteries of wind, rain, and darkness. Those who attain the rank of Lower Immortal thereby fathom the mechanisms of life and death. Kings and lords who attain it harmonize with the four seasons, nourishing the myriad beings, summoning and sensing the harmonious qi, and thus attain long life.

Ordinary people, unaware of how to entrust their forms, equate themselves with Heaven and Earth, yet dissipate their spirit, qi, and blood, hastening decline and death. The secret of long life in the *Wondrous Treasure* circulates and flows, returning to the root and restoring the mandate. The hun and po chant and sing, the qi and blood suffuse with radiance. Thereafter, one conceals the form and eludes traces, hunger and cold cannot assail, demons and toxins are dispelled, and one withdraws from the world, forsaking its flavors.

As for attaining the Dao of effortless long life—the origin of the myriad methods—it does not lie beyond this threshold. Thus, within the Four Poles of Heaven, the Sanskrit texts of Brahmā’s resplendent sounds comprise one pole of sixty-four characters, which are the written symbols of the Five Phases and hexagrams, inseparable from the human body. If one can awaken to understanding with each breath, merging essence and qi, harmonizing the numinous sounds, one becomes a person of long life and deathlessness.

In Heaven, it forms the sounds and qi of the celestial signs; on Earth, it forms the shapes and substances of the myriad beings; in humans, it is obtained through the subtle interplay of awareness. Thereafter, one knows emptiness as not-empty and form as not-form—this is called illumination, penetrating the wondrous sounds of the self. The body aligns with Heaven and Earth, the qi merges with the *Hidden Writ*.

Those who know the sounds practice seven stages:
First, the body becomes light;
Second, the spirit becomes tranquil;
Third, the qi becomes complete;
Fourth, the essence becomes unobstructed;
Fifth, the spirit transforms;
Sixth, one attains numinous communication;
Seventh, one becomes a treasure.
Naturally harmonized, one ascends to the Upper Clarity, soaring to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital.

*The Talisman of the Great Demon-Quelling Might of the Azure Emperor*

For all who wish to receive and uphold it: On the day of the Beginning of Spring, with sincere devotion, burn incense and face the first light of the eastern sun. On *jiǎzǐ*, *gēngshēn*, and the Three Origin days, at the hour of the cock’s crow, sit upright, close the eyes, clasp the hands, and remain at ease. Await the qi to settle and become even and harmonious. Do not rub the face or eyes with the hands, lest the spirit and qi be disturbed.

Exhale with saliva to rinse the mouth, swallow the saliva once, and strike the teeth three times. Then draw in a breath of qi, regulating the breath until it is even. Exhale gently through the nose, slowly and evenly, until the qi naturally suffuses the skin, blood vessels, and pores, and the six senses become pure and clear. This cultivates the qi of Non-Arising Life in the Eastern Quarter of Azure Vastness.

Draw in a breath of qi to nurture embryonic breathing. If one does not draw in the qi, it rushes into the Southern Palace of the Heart Emperor, where the mutual overcoming of the Five Phases renders it unusable.

To prolong the breath, focus the mind and eyes on the nostrils, and it will naturally endure. Then hold the breath for a long duration, listening inwardly with the mind as if to the buzzing of flies or insects.

When ordinary people observe and listen to sounds and sights, their spirit scatters and flees through the ears and eyes, leading swiftly to illness, short life, or premature death. By constantly listening inwardly with the mind, as if to the sound of insects, the hun and po remain undispersed. Thus, dwelling in the realm of sensual desire, if one constantly practices this method, passions and desires will naturally fade, the spirit will not decline, and one will not know this method only when the spirit is exhausted and the essence depleted—then death draws near.

Next, visualize the body transforming into mountains, rivers, forests, and trees, as if standing beneath Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon. With prolonged practice, the essence and qi are inwardly preserved, and one perceives the body as a mountain’s image, stabilizing the hundred spirits. Thus, the essence and qi are generated and preserved, and illnesses naturally heal.

At this point, slowly open the eyes and swallow the talisman with pure water—this summons the Azure Emperor to guard the hun. According to the *Hidden Writ of the Eastern Quarter*, from *Dǎnlóu Ācāng* to the Four Images of *Xūyuán*, these are the Eight Heavens of the East, corresponding to the eight trigrams. The aforementioned sixty-four characters divide the sounds and qi into sixty-four hexagrams, belonging to the Wood Virtue of the Spring Office, the flourishing essence of luxuriance.

The Eastern Dipper governs destiny, under the governance of the Azure Emperor. Within the human body, it serves as the Guardian of the *hun*, presiding over the *hun* of the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, hair, and the Gate of Life. The celestial demon of the East is named Bayuan Choubo, subject to the *Tianpeng* military arts. On *wuchen* and *jisi* days, the *nayin* corresponds to Wood. One should practice the Eastern *qi* talisman and concurrently employ the Central Ultimate *qi* talisman. On days when the *nayin* pertains to Wood, follow this method: combine the aforementioned four characters into one talisman, or inscribe them in large or small seal script according to form.

When inscribing this talisman, face east, hold the left palm upward, press the thumb against the middle finger’s center, and grasp the brush with the right hand. Recite the sixty-four characters of the Eastern Eight Heavens’ sound-text, then visualize the Eight Heavenly Emperors of the East suspended in the clouds, midair, lowering a pearl like a pellet. Strike the teeth three times, draw a mouthful of azure *qi* from the pearl, and blow it onto the brush. Recite the incantation:

*"By the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning, Bayuan Choubo, Demon King, receives the Great Law of Tianpeng. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute!"*

Next, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar: first write *Bayuan Choubo*, then trace the eight trigrams atop the characters, layering them. Write the character *chi* (敕), then turn the brush nine times counterclockwise before lifting it.

**Great Demon-Subduing Talisman of the Vermilion Heaven**
Light incense, sit calmly, and regulate the breath for over ten cycles until even and prolonged. Visualize the heart as a lotus flower, then rinse the mouth, swallow the saliva, and moisten the throat. Imagine the *qi* of the heart connecting with the *qi* of the eyes, then direct the heart’s *qi* upward to the crown of the head, passing behind it with a sound like thunder, as if wind and rain, residing between the brows. Envision the pupils of the eyes as twin golden rings. Rotate the golden rings nine times counterclockwise before the eyes.

If one sees flowers—yellow or black—before the eyes, it signifies the dispersion of essence and *qi*, with the spirit-light straying outward, causing ocular ailments. Practicing this Nine Revolutions of Spirit-Light method restores luminosity, preserving clarity even in old age. Next, imagine the body enveloped in fierce flames, feeling a slight warmth. Then visualize the Pillar of Heaven, resounding with thunder and lightning, sensing the opening of every pore and bone, the body bathed in ascending and descending dew—this possesses great power to sever evil and repel malevolence.

According to the *Hidden Writ of the Southern Quarter*, from *Nanyan Dongfu* to *Shenying Zigong*, these are the Eight Heavens of the South, corresponding to the eight trigrams. The sixty-four characters divide the sounds and *qi* into sixty-four hexagrams, belonging to the Fire Virtue of the Summer Office, the radiant essence of brilliance. The Southern Dipper governs life, under the governance of the Vermilion Emperor. Within the human body, it serves as the Nurturer of *Qi*, presiding over the Gate of the Heart Emperor’s generative *qi* and the pivot of vitality.

The celestial demon of the South is named Futian Danshi, subject to the *Tianyou* military arts. On *bingyin* and *dingmao* days, the *nayin* corresponds to Fire. One should practice the Southern *qi* talisman and concurrently employ the Central Ultimate *qi* talisman. On days when the *nayin* pertains to Fire, follow this method.

When inscribing the talisman, face south, press the thumb against the first joint of the middle finger, grasp the brush, and recite the sixty-four characters of the Southern Eight Heavens’ sound-text. Visualize the Eight Heavenly Emperors of the South suspended above the clouds, lowering a jewel like a pellet. Strike the teeth three times, draw a mouthful of vermilion *qi* from the jewel, and blow it onto the brush. Recite the incantation:

*"By the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning, Futian Danshi, Demon King, receives the Great Law of Tianyou. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute!"*

Next, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar: first write *Futian Danshi*, then trace the eight trigrams. Write the character *chi* (敕), turn the brush three times, and lift it as prescribed.

**Great Demon-Subduing Talisman of the White Emperor**
Light incense, sit calmly, face west, and regulate the breath for over ten cycles until even. Visualize a golden light radiating from the heart, illuminating all, then direct the heart’s *qi* into the two breasts. Once accomplished, rinse the mouth, swallow the saliva, and guide it into the Flowery Canopy of the lungs. Imagine the body within a forest of seven treasures, beholding mountains of extraordinary height—towering like ten thousand *ren*—rising from the great sea, concealed from the mundane world.

Next, visualize two *yongquan* (bubbling spring) acupoints beside the breasts. From beneath the Cinnabar Heaven, *qi* ascends into these points, flowing outward and dispersing into the sea—this is the method of counterflow, preserving essence and *qi*. If the *qi* of the two breasts is depleted, the heart’s sound resembles a pestle, influenced by the corpse-spirit.

According to the *Hidden Writ of the Western Quarter*, from *Daoli Chanyou* to *Baikong Duxian*, these are the Eight Heavens of the West, corresponding to the eight trigrams. The sixty-four characters divide the sounds and *qi* into sixty-four hexagrams, belonging to the Metal Virtue of the Autumn Office, the luminous essence of the *po*. The Western Dipper records names under the governance of the White Emperor. Within the human body, it serves as the Attendant of the *po*, presiding over the *po* of the lungs, the Flowery Canopy, and the Earthly Root.

The celestial demon of the West is named Fanshan Liumu, subject to the *Yisheng* military arts. On *jiazi* and *yichou* days, the *nayin* corresponds to Metal. One should practice the Western *qi* talisman and concurrently employ the Central Ultimate *qi* method. On other days when the *nayin* pertains to Metal, follow this method.

When inscribing this talisman, face west, press the thumb against the middle joint of the middle finger, grasp the brush with the right hand, and recite the sixty-four characters of the Western Eight Heavens’ sound-text. Visualize the Eight Heavenly Emperors of the West suspended above the clouds, lowering a jewel like a pellet. Strike the teeth three times, draw a mouthful of white *qi* from the jewel, and blow it onto the brush. Recite the incantation:

*"By the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning, Fanshan Liumu, Demon King, receives the Great Law of Yisheng. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute!"*

Next, inscribe the talisman: first write *Fanshan Liumu*, then trace the eight trigrams. Write the character *chi* (敕), turn the brush seven times, and lift it as prescribed.

**Great Demon-Subduing Talisman of the Black Emperor**
Light incense, sit calmly, face north, and regulate the breath for over ten cycles until even and prolonged. Imagine black *qi* dispersing from the ears, the sound within resembling the faint chirping of cicadas, lingering intermittently. Naturally, the spirit and *qi* become tranquil, and the Blood Monarch pays homage to the Origin.

For all ailments of the limbs, bones, and blood, this method is essential for their dissolution. Next, regulate the breath and hold the *qi*, visualizing the images of the sun and moon in the heavens descending before the brows, illuminating the ten directions. Then, let the sun enter through the left nostril and the moon through the right, proceeding to the back of the crown. Next, let them enter the *dantian*, their radiance shining through the entire body. First, visualize the solar orb within the *dantian*, circulating and revolving nine times. Then, imagine the sun to the left and the moon to the right within the *dantian*, unmoving, emitting five-colored light that ascends through the *Tianzhu* (Heavenly Pillar) to the back of the crown, illuminating the ten directions. Visualize the sun and moon within the *dantian* as if smelting metal and stone in a great furnace. Refine thus at will until cessation. This is the method of the Inner Golden Elixir; with years of practice, one becomes an immortal. If one swirls the *qi* and rinses the mouth, it forms the appearance of flowing pearls.

According to the *Hidden Writ of the North*, from *Juewu Ziyu* to *Youji Duren*, these represent the eight heavens and eight trigrams of the North, sixty-four characters dividing yin and yang into sixty-four hexagrams. Above, they correspond to the Water Virtue of the Winter Office; the essence of *Quyu* (Curved Nurturance); the descent of the Northern Dipper into death; and the governance of the Black Emperor. Within the human body, they pertain to the *Tongxue Jun* (Blood Monarch), presiding over the true yang and the root-generating blood of the kidneys. The celestial demon of the North is named *Jianchou Langfu*, governed by the Black *Sha* (Killing) martial arts. On *Bingzi* and *Dingchou* days, when the *nayin* (sound of the cyclical signs) belongs to Water, perform the *qi* talismans of the North and concurrently those of the *Zhongji* (Central Ultimate). All days when the *nayin* belongs to Water follow this rule.

When inscribing the talisman, face north. With the left hand, press the second joint of the middle finger; with the right hand, hold the brush. Recite the sixty-four characters of the *Yinwen* (Sound Text) of the Eight Heavens of the North. Close your eyes and visualize the Eight Heavenly Emperor Lords of the North upon the clouds, suspending a jewel as large as a pellet. Strike the teeth three times, draw the black *qi* from the jewel, and blow it onto the brush. Recite the incantation:

*"By the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning, Demon King Jianchou Langfu, receive the Great Law of the Black Sha. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute!"*

Next, inscribe the talisman: first write *Jianchou Langfu*, then trace the eight trigrams, then write the character *chi* (敕). Turn the brush seven times and lift it as prescribed.

**Great Demon-Subduing Talisman of the Yellow Emperor**
Light incense, sit calmly, and regulate the breath for over ten cycles until even and prolonged. Visualize black *qi* at the crown of the head ascending into the azure heavens, transforming into a palace with a defined circular form. Imagine yourself clad in a robe of five-colored clouds and mist, wearing a crown adorned with *liu* (pendant strings of beads), holding a jade tablet, and seated in bejeweled slippers. Within the circular form you perceive, a numinous light illuminates the space between heaven and earth, resembling the celestial palace where the Heavenly Emperor resides, all naturally manifesting. This is used to summon the Lord of the Central Yellow Emperor.

This is the method of the *Zhongji* (Central Ultimate) of the Primordial Beginning, governed by the Great *Kui* Lord of the Central Dipper. As the scripture states: *"The Central Yellow Emperor, unrivaled by the myriad spirits, oversees the offices of all numinous beings."* The demon king is named *Hengtian Danli*. This revered one resides above the Four Ultimates, the essence of the Earth Virtue of the Primordial Upright *qi*. The method of cultivating the circular image of perfection gathers *qi* into the realm of the formless. After practicing this, one returns to the root and restores life, refining essence to nourish *qi*, refining *qi* to nourish spirit, and refining substance to attain perfection. As the scripture states: *"Ascend to the Upper Clarity, enter and exit the Flowery Chambers; within the Eight Obscurities and the subtlest realms, below it governs the human body, the *Niuwan* (Mud Pill Palace) and *Jianggong* (Crimson Palace); centrally, it harmonizes the five *qi* and unites the hundred spirits. With ten revolutions, the spirit returns; with the myriad *qi*, one ascends as an immortal."*

On *Gengwu* and *Xinwei* days, when the *nayin* belongs to Earth, perform the *qi* talismans of the *Zhongji* (Central Ultimate) exclusively, without combining the methods of the four directions. All days when the *nayin* belongs to Earth follow this rule, ensuring the completion of both the Inner and Outer Golden Elixirs.

When inscribing this talisman, face east and visualize the center. With the left hand, palm upward, press the middle joint of the middle finger and hold the brush. Recite the incantation:

*"Radiance establishes completion and deliverance; life repels and disperses to achieve perfection."*

Visualize the Primordial Beginning Supreme Emperor in the layered heavens, suspending a jewel from which five-colored *qi* emanates. Inhale the *qi* and blow it onto the brush. Recite the incantation:

*"By the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning, Demon King Hengtian Danli, receive the Great Law of the Central Dipper’s Great Kui. Enable me to refine essence to nourish *qi*, refine *qi* to nourish spirit, refine substance to attain perfection, and ascend this very day. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute!"*

Next, use cinnabar to inscribe the talisman: first write *Hengtian Danli*, omitting the trigrams. Then write the ten characters *Guangming Lichengdu Shengpi Rangducheng* (光明立成度生辟禳度成). Next, write the character *chi* (敕), turn the brush once, and lift it as prescribed.

This method is the Way of the Supreme Perfected, enabling one to ascend to the Golden Gates and wander in the Jade Capital. When adepts of the Dao practice to this point, they swallow and ingest according to the previous method.

The above five talismans, when used to aid others and treat illness, should be matched to the corresponding viscera based on the Five Phases. For example, if the illness is in the liver, use the talisman of the East. For disasters such as water, fire, or weapons, use the talisman of the phase that overcomes them. If the calamity is water, use the talisman of the Central Earth to remedy it.

When inscribing talismans on objects, instruments, or implements, whether in grass script or seal script, they may vary in size, but the sounds, texts, principles, and strokes must not be lost for efficacy.

The Master said: *"Since the Crimson Clarity opened the chart, and Shennong, the Flame Emperor, the thirty-two Heavenly Emperor Lords descended in succession to the world, establishing the Way of purity and correctness. In the time of the Yellow Emperor of Youxiong, the thirty-two Heavenly Emperor Lords began anew. Selecting the clear and turbid, they established the images of the methods, all pertaining to the Way of form and substance. The Heavenly Perfected recorded their texts as the orthodoxy of the Five Phases. From antiquity, the images of the Five Phases and trigrams have been employed as the Way of long life and aiding beings. The Numinous Writ of the Thirty-Two Heavens is the office through which the Supreme Emperor governs, corresponding below to the honored titles of emperors and kings."*

Since antiquity following the Yellow Emperor’s cultivation of perfection and ascent to the Great August Yellow Once-Heaven, through the cyclic succession of a hundred kings down to the Tang’s Illustrious Emperor Xuanzong, who ascended to the Heaven of Primordial Potency, all have been recorded in canonical texts. The lords of Zhou Mu, Qin Shi, and Han Wu, along with their attendant ministers, may also be enumerated and examined. Thus we know that the Way by which heaven-men and superior scholars ascend to perfection lies concealed within esoteric writings. Within the Thirty-Two Heavens, each heaven contains eight sonic characters, and one celestial pole comprises sixty-four sonic characters in total, establishing the images of the Eight Trigrams. Those who obtain them may attain long life. For the celestial script is the script of sun, moon, stars, and earth, the script of mountains, rivers, forests, and humankind. The essence, qi, and spirit of sun, moon, and stars employ luminous radiance through the Dao; the mountains, rivers, and forests employ the measure of life through the Dao. Thus the scripture states: “Without script, there is no illumination; without script, there is no clarity; without script, there is no establishment; without script, there is no completion; without script, there is no deliverance; without script, there is no life.” It further states: “Nothing is not opened, nothing is not exorcised, nothing is not delivered, nothing is not completed.” Such is the wondrous efficacy of the Dao.

Therefore, the Thirty-Two Heavens descend to govern the human body, extending to the four limbs, nine orifices, five viscera, and six bowels, mysteriously aligning with the thirty-two celestial palaces. Those who know and cultivate this align with the Dao of Heaven. Moreover, there is the Yellow Emperor’s True Round Image Great Method of cultivation, which follows the Five Phases and five qi, prescribing the daily ingestion of a qi talisman corresponding to each direction—all essential techniques of governance.

In the time of the Yellow Emperor, when he was harmed by demonic forces, he employed the talismanic charts of the Five Directions, inscribing them upon swords and halberds to subdue and annihilate them. He also painted images upon the banners of the Five Directions to battle Chiyou at Zhuolu. Thus we know that the Round Image can stir and move the Round Ultimate. Later, when his merit was fulfilled and virtue perfected, he ascended in broad daylight. The Yellow Emperor’s writings state: “The correctness of the Dipper’s Wilds corresponds to the Round Image’s earth.” After its location was lost, only Emperor Xuanzong diligently sought it, learning that a divine person had presented it upon the Huai River, where the four directions aligned in perfect square. There he established the Hall of the Dipper’s Wilds, now ruined and reduced to pavilions.

In ancient times, when Yu the Great controlled the floods, he observed the script of the Great Brahmā’s numinous sound and Eight Trigrams, following the configurations of mountains and rivers to bore springs and excavate caverns. Moving with flying steps through the Round Image, he dredged and cleared the Nine Rivers—all through divine efficacy—thus achieving the governance of Great Peace. The lords of Zhou Mu, Qin Shi, and Han Wu all sought this Way, yet most lost its source. Later generations altered the Round Image talismanic charts, adding or omitting strokes based on Yu’s regulation of the Five Phases’ configurations, rendering them devoid of sonic resonance.

By the Eastern Jin, the Perfected One Xu Xun, harmed by demonic forces in the rivers and lakes, personally received the Yellow Emperor’s writings and inscribed the Five Talismans upon iron tablets, casting them into the Xiang shallows to sever and vanquish demonic toxins. These talismanic tablets remain beneath the Bright Pool of Changsha. The Perfected One employed them to govern demonic forces, save living beings, accumulate merit and cultivate conduct, and ultimately ascend with his entire household. The Immortal Elder Ge Hong often used these talismans, inscribing them upon water on days when the Five Phases mutually overcame one another, causing the script to flow upstream—all who witnessed it recognized its divine marvel.

During the Qin Emperor’s search for numinous traces, his minister Xu Fu presented the *Yu’s Steps Celestial and Terrestrial Round Image* and the *Book of Subduing Demons*. He desired to make the people pure and correct, urging them to wear and practice it, enabling them to journey to the Azure Vaults by morning and return to the imperial palace by evening. Yet he abandoned Confucian studies, yearned for the dwelling of Penglai, and conscripted the people, causing countless unjust deaths. Losing proper governance, he forfeited his mandate as an official of the Heavenly Emperor. Thus we know that the sage-kings of antiquity and the rulers of today all correspond to the governance of the Thirty-Two Heavens.

In the *Xuanhe* era’s *gengzi* cycle, its image was square within and round without; in the *bingwu* year, its image was round within and square without. Thus the northwest suffered floods and the scourge of warfare. Knowing this, one should establish the Round Image to correspond with the Huai River, inscribe the numinous talismans and cast them upon the Three Mountains to govern this cyclical conjunction. Thus may Heaven be preserved in perpetuity, the myriad people rely upon it, and the living and dead obtain blessings.

Herein is briefly recorded its marvels, serving as essential and verified scripture.

*Concluding the Twentieth Scroll of the* Great Method of the Numinous Treasure’s Immeasurable *Sutra of Salvation for Humanity*
*Beginning the Twenty-First Scroll of the* Great Method of the Numinous Treasure’s Immeasurable *Sutra of Salvation for Humanity*

**The True Forms of the Five Peaks**

In ancient times, Emperor Wu of Han, fond of the Dao of longevity, frequently offered sacrifices to renowned mountains and great marshes, praying to the numinous peaks in quest of divine transcendents’ response. In the first month of the *yuanfeng* reign’s first year, on the *jiazi* day, he ascended Mount Songgao, erected a Daoist palace, and fasted for seven days. Upon completing the rites, he returned.

By the fourth month, on the *wuchen* day, while in quiet repose with Dongfang Shuo and Dong Zhongshu at his side, he suddenly beheld a woman clad in azure robes, of extraordinary beauty. Startled, the Emperor asked who she was. She replied, “I am the Jade Maiden of the Walled City Palace, sent by the Queen Mother of the West from Mount Kunlun to speak with you. I hear you wish to relinquish the emoluments of the Four Seas, seek the Dao, and transcend the throne of kingship, yet you repeatedly pray to the sacred peaks—how earnest is your heart! The Way of transcendence may be taught. Fast for a hundred days, abstain from worldly affairs, and on the seventh day of the seventh month, the Queen Mother of the West shall briefly descend.”

Emperor Wu descended from his seat and knelt in assent. The maiden vanished without a trace.

Thereupon, the Emperor ascended the Terrace of Seeking the True, fasting in stillness to cultivate the Dao, while entrusting governance to his ministers. By the seventh day of the seventh month, he purified the inner palace, arranged a seat in the great hall, spread brocade upon the ground, burned incense of a hundred harmonies, hung cloud-patterned silk curtains, lit nine luminous lamps, and prepared grape wine and sweet nectar as offerings for host and guest. Clad in ceremonial robes, he stood at the foot of the steps, commanding that none within the palace gates dare peer forth. Within and without, all was hushed and still, awaiting the arrival of the immortal officials.

After the second watch of the night, a white cloud suddenly arose in the southwest, dense and swift, advancing directly toward the palace. Soon, the sounds of flutes, drums, and the clamor of men and horses filled the air. After half a meal’s time, the Queen Mother arrived before the Suspended-Head Hall, as if birds alighting. Some rode cloud-dragons and cloud-tigers, some white deer, some white *lin* beasts, some white cranes; others came in chariots or astride celestial steeds. Thousands of transcendents filled the courtyard.

Once they arrived, their attendants vanished from sight. Only the Queen Mother was visible, seated in a carriage of purple clouds, drawn by nine multicolored striped dragons. Fifty celestial transcendents flanked her cloud-chariot, each a *zhang* in height, bearing soft-tasseled staffs, girded with golden celestial seals, wielding the staves of perfected beings, and leaning against the pillars below the hall. The Queen Mother, supported by two attendants, ascended the hall. The attendants appeared sixteen or seventeen years of age, clad in azure-sashed cassia robes, their gazes distant and spirits luminous.

The Queen Mother took her seat facing east, draped in a yellow brocade robe, its patterns radiant, golden light shimmering. A great sash of cloud-patterned silk crossed her chest, and at her waist hung the Sword of Divided Radiance. Upon her head rested the knot of Mount Taihua, crowned with the Diadem of Supreme Darkness and Dawn. Her feet were shod in black jade phoenix-embroidered slippers. Her brilliance illuminated the cloud-adorned beams, her divine radiance resplendent. Though she appeared but thirty years of age, her stature was perfect, her celestial grace profound, her cloud-like visage peerless—a true daughter of heaven.

Descending from her carriage and ascending the dais, Emperor Wu bowed and knelt, exchanging courtesies. Then, as if by prior arrangement, he was summoned to sit beside her. The Emperor faced south, while the Queen Mother personally prepared the feast, its refinement unparalleled. Rare delicacies, fragrant fruits, purple mushrooms, jade elixirs, and powders filled the platters. The clear, sweet nectar, unlike anything of the mortal realm, bore a fragrance so exquisite the Emperor could not name it.

She then commanded her attendants to fetch peaches. Soon, a jade platter bore seven peaches, each the size of a goose egg, round and verdant. The Queen Mother presented them to the Emperor, who received four, while she consumed three. The peaches were so sweet and savory that their flavor lingered in the mouth. The Emperor saved the pits, and the Queen Mother asked why. He replied, “I wish to plant them.” She said, “These peaches bear fruit but once in three thousand years. The soil of the mortal realm is too meager—they will not grow.” The Emperor desisted.

He then prostrated himself and confessed: “I, Liu Che, unworthy and untalented, have wallowed in the mundane world. Inheriting the legacy of my ancestors, I am shackled by worldly burdens. My governance is flawed, the people ignorant; the seasons are disordered, the Five Grains barren. My virtue and grace do not extend far, and bandits and foreign foes assail me. I am unfit to be their lord, my sins as towering as mountains. Yet from youth, I have cherished the Dao of longevity and admired the divine transcendents. I have not been able to abandon rank and renown to dwell in the mountains and forests, to sever worldly ties and know not where to turn. Forsaking the world to seek the True, I have drilled and inquired without a teacher. Time presses upon me, and I fear my years will swiftly pass. Never did I imagine that celestial transcendents would suddenly descend. Today, this humble servant is fortunate to behold Your Sagely Eminence. It must be my destined fate to attain deliverance. I beseech you, take pity and grant me the teachings I have yet to comprehend, that I may receive and uphold your profound instructions.”

The Queen Mother replied: “That you scorn glory and delight in humility, immersing yourself in the savor of the Dao, is already commendable. Yet your passions and desires are excessive, your licentiousness and disorder extreme. Your killing and punitive measures are unlawful, your extravagance innate. Lust is the chariot that rends the body, licentiousness the axe that shatters the years. Killing invites retribution, extravagance rots the heart. Desires accumulate and the spirit perishes; filth gathers and life is severed. With a body so slight, you harbor the thieves of annihilation; with timber a foot long, you invite a hundred blades. How can you hope to escape the three-foot noose and preserve your body forever? It is like a wingless bird longing to soar over the celestial pond, or a morning mushroom yearning for spring and autumn.

If you can sweep away these manifold disorders, purge impurity and transform your nature, preserve your spirit and *qi* within the Crimson Palace, seal the Palace of Lust and never open it, still extravagance in the chamber of stillness, cherish all living beings without endangering them, uphold these precepts of the Dao, contemplate the savor of the numinous, practice benevolence and bestow benefits, refine your essence and treasure your *qi*, dispel frivolity, and hasten the departure of all competitions—if you conduct yourself thus, shall you not attain something akin to the Way?”

Should you fail to do so, it would be as futile as embracing a stone to cross a vast river.

The Emperor knelt to receive the sacred precepts and pledged to heed these words. He then noticed a small scroll in the Queen Mother’s sash, encased in a purple brocade pouch. The Emperor inquired whether this scroll was a divine formula, and whether he might dare to gaze upon it. The Queen Mother brought it forth, saying, “This is the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*. The immortals of Mount Qingcheng recently sought it from me, and I shall soon pass it to them. It was issued by the Supreme Lord of the Three Heavens, its scriptures secret and its prohibitions weighty—how could your impure frame be worthy to bear it? For now, I shall give you the *Scripture of Numinous Radiance and Vital Flourishing*, which may open your spirit and inspire your resolve.”

The Emperor persisted in his entreaty. The Queen Mother replied, “In the first year of the *Pure Numinosity* reign of the Supreme August One, the Supreme Lord of the Dao, the Heavenly Honored One, descended to survey the Six Directions. He measured the length of the Milky Way, assessed the heights of mountains and depths of valleys, named the lofty pillars to stabilize the earth’s principles, and established the Five Peaks as anchors for the realm’s guardians. He honored Mount Kunlun as the abode of divine immortals, exalted Mount Penglai as the retreat of perfected beings, stationed the water spirits at the source of utmost yin, and settled the Great Emperor in the ruins of Fusang. Thus, Mount Fangzhang became the chamber of destiny’s governance, while the isles of the Canglang Sea housed the halls of the Nine Elders. The lands of Zuying, Xuan’yan, and Changyuan, where the streams of life flow endlessly, and the caverns where phoenixes and unicorns gather, each bore the names of their respective isles—all lying amidst the dark currents of the vast ocean. Its waters were jade-black, their waves surging and crashing. Divine immortals, jade maidens, and hosts of spirits dwelled within the azure sea. Though their names were elusive, their forms were distinct.

You observe the contours of mountains, the winding paths of rivers and peaks, the undulations of ridges and mounds, the towering heights and sweeping lengths of ranges, their spiraling, serpentine forms resembling written characters. Thus, their names were fashioned according to their shapes, their titles fixed to reflect their essence. Their images were inscribed upon the Dark Terrace and issued as tokens of the numinous and true. When immortals bear them, it is as if they carry transmitted seals. When Daoists hold them and traverse mountains and rivers, the hundred spirits and lords of the numinous pay them homage and welcome them with reverence.

Though you are not yet perfected, your repeated journeys to mountains and marshes, your earnest quest for the Dao, have not been forgotten. Delighted by your sincerity, I now bestow this upon you. You must treasure it deeply, as you would serve a sovereign or father. Should you reveal it to the unworthy, calamity will surely follow.

According to the statutes of the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital and the *Luminous Mandate of the Nine Qi Venerable*, the *Great Numinous Writings* were all composed by the Supreme Lord of the Dao, the Heavenly Honored One of the Three Heavens. Some were crafted by the Heavenly Perfected of the Three Sovereigns, others issued by the Red Youths, the True Persons and Divine Parents of the Nine Heavens. Such texts are transmitted to but one person every thirty years. If no worthy recipient is found in forty years, the transmission is withheld; in eighty years, only two may receive it. To confer it upon the unworthy is to leak the Way of Heaven. To withhold it from the deserving is to hoard Heaven’s treasure. To bestow it recklessly without regard for limits is to trifle with Heaven’s elders. To receive it without reverence is to scorn Heaven’s splendor. Leaking, hoarding, trifling, and scorning—these four transgressions summon the chariots of retribution. Leaking brings death upon the road, the recipient’s form vanishing and their bones scattering. Hoarding brings blindness and deafness in future lives, their vitality withering in sudden demise. Trifling brings misfortune upon one’s parents, consigning them to Fengdu for punishment. Scorning brings a violent end, followed by affliction with grievous illness in the next life. Worse still are those whose crimes sever their lineage and annihilate their clan.

Those of the same Dao are called Heaven’s kin; those of the same heart are called Earth’s beloved. In transmission, there must be mutual affection, shared honor and disgrace, a united heart in truth, and cherished essence and fluid. Together, you must cultivate harmonious *qi*; when *qi* is whole, spirit returns, and you shall surely attain the assembly of the numinous. Should you fail in this, Heaven will visit calamity upon you. These are the statutes and prohibitions of the Dao, warnings passed down through the ages—you must not be careless.

If you seek someone to whom you might transmit this, Dong Zhongjun appears to be a fitting candidate.” She then commanded her attendants to retrieve another scroll, which she presented to Emperor Wu. The attendant drew from her bosom a scroll of sacred writ, its brilliance equal to the first. The Queen Mother placed it in the Emperor’s hands, and he knelt to receive it with reverence.

The Queen Mother said, “Should you succeed in clarifying your true nature, turning from evil and cultivating goodness, return in three years and seven months, and I shall reveal more of the Dao to you.”

Suddenly, from the southern window of the vermilion bird hall, a figure peered in at the Queen Mother. The Emperor, startled, asked who it was. The Queen Mother replied, “You do not recognize him? He is your attendant, Dongfang Shuo. A mischievous boy from my neighborhood, he has thrice stolen these peaches. Formerly an immortal official of Mount Tai, the Supreme Lord sent him to Fangzhang to assist the Celestial Controller of Destinies in examining the households of immortals. Yet upon arriving at Fangzhang, he indulged only in wandering mountains and waters, neglecting to cultivate harmonious *qi*. He wantonly manipulated thunder and lightning, stirred waves and scattered sand, disrupting the timely rhythms of wind and rain, throwing yin and yang into disorder. This caused dragons and leviathans to crawl on land, mountains to crumble, borders to collapse, the sea to dry up violently, and the Yellow River to overflow unpredictably. He harmed the fields of grain and magic mushrooms, drowned himself in wine, and failed in his duties of harmonious governance, violating the statutes of his commission. The Venerable of the Nine Springs reported this to the Supreme Lord, who demoted and banished him to the mortal realm, exiling him from the court of the Great Clarity to dwell among the foul and stinking masses.

Nine years ago, two immortals from Mount Huangjinhua and the Lord of Mount Jiuyi petitioned on his behalf. Only then did I learn that Shuo was no ordinary man.” She then recounted to Emperor Wu the names of the immortal officials in her retinue, their attire, and the names of the objects they bore, explaining how they had attained their ranks.

As evening approached, the Queen Mother took her leave. Her procession of dragons and tigers, with drums and flutes leading the way, mirrored her arrival. Clouds billowed thickly, suffused with fragrance, and as she vanished into the southwest, the scent lingered long after.

Having witnessed the Queen Mother, the Emperor came to believe in the existence of divine immortals and began to contemplate plans for transcending the world. Yet he remained enslaved to lust and ceaseless in warfare, burdening the people with labor and filling the innocent with resentment. He disregarded the Queen Mother’s words, and she never returned.

The late Queen Mother, when she met the Emperor, spoke at length of many things—methods for extending life, arts for summoning spirits. The Emperor compiled these into a scroll, along with the scriptures and diagrams she had bestowed upon him. He placed them upon a table of yellow gold, sealed them in a casket of white jade, and stored them atop the Cypress-Beam Terrace.

Later, in the first year of the *Taichu* era, heavenly fire consumed the terrace. Thus were the *True Forms*, the *Scripture of Numinous Radiance*, and the Emperor’s own compilation of essential teachings lost to the flames. The Queen Mother, seeing that the Emperor had ignored her instructions, brought this calamity upon him.

Yet earlier, the Emperor had heeded the Queen Mother’s words and entrusted the diagrams to Dong Zhongjun. Zhongjun made a copy, and by this means they were preserved.

One day thereafter, Dongfang Shuo mounted a cloud-dragon and soared away. The assembled crowd saw him ascend from the northwest, rising gently into the heavens. As they gazed upward, a great mist enveloped him, and he vanished from sight. The Emperor was filled with remorse, knowing he had lost the Way.

That year, in the twelfth month, he performed the *tan* and *hao* rites in the Local Shrine, sacrificing to the Earth Queen. He journeyed east to the Bohai Sea to offer prayers to Mount Penglai. In spring, he returned to Ganyuan to receive the annual accounts. In the second month, he began construction of the Jianzhang Palace. In summer, the fifth month, he reformed the calendar, making the first month the beginning of the year, adopting yellow as the auspicious color, and using five as the standard number. He standardized official titles, harmonized musical tones, and dispatched General Gongsun Ao to build the Outer Wall’s Surrender-Accepting Fortress. In autumn, the eighth month, he traveled to Anding and sent General Li Guangli, the Ershi General, to mobilize exiled convicts from across the realm for a western campaign against Dayuan.

He revised the calendar to begin the year in the first month—this was the Queen Mother’s intent. Reflecting upon the Queen Mother, the matriarch of all immortals, one must treasure these texts. How much more should ordinary, petty men revere them?

When Emperor Wu asked Dongfang Shuo about the Queen Mother’s words, Shuo’s response was as recorded elsewhere.

Master Green Ox said: "My family possesses the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*. Each peak dispatches five spirits to guard and protect the diagrams and scriptures. For those who dwell in the mountains, the mountain and marsh spirits also constantly send officials to defend their bodies and households. If wicked men seek to harm them, the harm rebounds upon themselves. These forms repel the five weapons and the five pestilences; one may tread upon blades unscathed. They also expose human deceit and perversity—those who act unjustly bring misfortune upon themselves, while the impure bring calamity upon their households. Thus, one must be deeply cautious and reverent.

Whoever carries these texts or holds them while traversing mountains and forests will be met with bows and reverence from the hundred mountains’ earthly spirits and numinous lords. Even ghosts and spirits abase themselves in obeisance—how much more should ordinary men refrain from negligence?

The rivers and mountains—Jiang, He, Huai, and the central ranges—all fall under the governance of the Central Peak’s domain. Those who enter the mountains to gather the eight stones—stone likenesses, stone brains, flowing cinnabar, flowing pearls, flying stalks, yellow seeds, stone marrow, cassia blossoms, and divine herbs—will never obtain these immortal treasures without wearing the *Five Peaks Diagram*.

The proper method for wearing it is this: wrap it in blue silk, or use white silk, and place it in a purple pouch. One may wear it upon the head or bind it to the heart or elbow. No mountain, great or small, lacks its spirit. When the spirit appears, it will declare, ‘I am So-and-So of Such-and-Such Mountain, come to welcome you.’ The Most High True Person has designated these bamboo tally texts of the Five Peaks to guard this diagram and scripture. Just as people today respect the insignia and staffs of provincial inspectors, so too do the mountain spirits come to pay homage.

The method of transmission is restricted: it may be passed on only once every forty years, with a blood oath as covenant. Whoever keeps this text in their home will have the Five Peaks each dispatch five spirits to safeguard the diagram. The spirits of the mountains, rivers, sources, and marshes where they dwell will each send attendants to protect their person. If others harbor malice, plot against them, slander them, or seek to harm them—even if the authorities arrest them—the twenty-five spirits guarding the Five Peaks, along with the mountain and river attendants, will report to the lord of their resident peak. The spirits will then turn the harm back upon those who wished it, causing it to rebound upon themselves.

Those who receive this must not fail to purify their bodies and minds. If they act with perversity, negligence, or disrespect—if they slight the sacred trust or treat the teachings with contempt—disaster will strike, and their households will be destroyed. They must not be careless.

Entering the mountains without the *True Forms* invites corruption by myriad spirits. Gathering herbs without them invites obstruction by the mountain’s numina. Pursuing the Dao without them leaves the hun and qi unsettled, and the Three Corpses will sow chaos. Of a thousand paths and ten thousand affairs, none can be accomplished without this text. But with it worn upon the body, one may harmonize the household spirits, traverse heaven and earth unobstructed, be guarded by divine beings at home, and be welcomed by mountain spirits when abroad. Gathering and consuming divine herbs, one will be protected by true immortals. Passing through plagues and perils, heavenly disasters will vanish of their own accord. Thus may one depart in emptiness and return in fullness, with the truth of fortune and misfortune made manifest. Those of the Dao who come after must keep it secret and hold it in reverence."

In the first year of the *Yuanfeng* era, the Queen Mother of the West bestowed upon Emperor Xiaowu the *Preface to the Diagram of the Five Peaks*.

The *True Forms of the Five Peaks* as transmitted by Dongfang Shuo are representations of mountains and waters. The twisting boulders, the contours of hills and mounds, their heights and depths, lengths and folds—waves surge beneath the flourishing brush, peaks and ridges sharpen in clarity. Clouds and forests, dark and yellow, take on the appearance of written characters. Thus did the Heavenly Perfected Lord of the Dao descend to observe their patterns, tracing their paths and tendencies. Following the rhythm of the characters, he named the mountains according to their forms.

Whoever possesses the form of the Eastern Peak will enjoy peace of spirit and extension of life, preserving their body for long ages. Entering mountains and crossing rivers, a hundred divine herbs will gather of their own accord.

Whoever possesses the form of the Southern Peak will be untouched by the five pestilences, repelling fire and light. Those who plot evil against them will suffer harm in return.

Whoever possesses the form of the Central Peak will find all their pursuits profitable, amassing vast wealth. If they seek to forge alliances, it will require no labor of body or strength.

Whoever possesses the form of the Western Peak will dispel the weapons of kings, walk unharmed through blades, and be revered and welcomed by the spirits of mountains and rivers.

Whoever possesses the form of the Northern Peak will be spared disaster when entering water, with all poisons subdued. They will command dragons and enjoy enduring blessings and fortune.

If you possess the forms of all Five Peaks, you shall traverse heaven and earth, encompassing the four directions. When the spirits behold you with joy, humans and gods alike will be of one accord.

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor mustered the lords for battle against Chiyou in the wilds of Zhuolu. Having captured the rebellious lords, all revered Xuanyuan as the Son of Heaven, succeeding Shennong as the Yellow Emperor. Whenever there were those in the realm who refused to submit, he would lead expeditions to subdue them. He shattered mountains to open roads, never resting in one place. To the east, he reached the sea, ascending Mount Tai to inscribe the Dai Zong. To the west, he arrived at Kongtong, climbing Jitou. To the south, he came to the Jiang, ascending Xiongxiang. To the north, he pressed on to Hui Zhou, uniting the talismans at Fushan, and established his capital in the wilds of Zhuolu. His movements were ceaseless, without fixed abode.

Observing that the Four Peaks each had auxiliary mountains of destiny, only the Southern Peak stood solitary without support. Thus, he composed a petition to the Three Heavens’ Supreme Dao Lord, designating Mount Huo and Mount Qian as reserve lords. The petition was approved. The Emperor then personally crafted the mountains, inscribing their forms and images, linking them to the Five Peaks. He further commanded Qingcheng as the Abode of the Venerable Elder and Mount Lu as the Form of the Envoy, arranging them in proper sequence to continue this legacy, which began with the Yellow Emperor.

The Lord of the Eastern Peak, Mount Tai, commands a host of five thousand nine hundred officials. He governs plagues and the cycle of life and death, serving as the marshal of all ghosts. He is the ancestral lord of blood sacrifices and temple rites. All those who die worshipping heretical spirits or malevolent deities in the mundane world are sent to Mount Tai to receive punishment and judgment. When those who bear the forms of the Five Peaks enter the mountains and forests or visit Mount Tai, the Lord of Mount Tai and the spirits of all mountains and rivers will come forth to welcome and bow to them. The Lord of Mount Tai wears a cyan robe, a seven-tiered azure crown, and bears the Seal of Pervading Yang and Great Brilliance. He rides a green dragon, accompanied by his retinue, to welcome you.

The Lord of the Southern Peak, Mount Heng, commands seventy thousand seven hundred immortals. When you enter the mountains under his jurisdiction, all mountain spirits will come forth to welcome you. The Lord of the Southern Peak wears a robe of vermilion radiance, a crown of Ninefold Cinnabar and Solar Essence, and bears the Seal of Night Radiance and Supreme Perfection. He rides a red dragon, accompanied by his retinue, to welcome you.

The Lord of the Central Peak, Mount Song, commands thirty thousand jade maidens. When you enter the mountains under his domain, all renowned spirits of the Central Peak will come forth to welcome you. The Lord of the Central Peak wears a robe of yellow silk, a crown of Yellow Jade and Great Si, and bears the Talisman of Divine Harmony and Yang. He rides a yellow dragon, accompanied by his ministers, to welcome you. The Central Peak is the sovereign of the Five Peaks; you should revere it well. The Supreme Lord often appoints True Persons of virtue and renown from the Three Heavens to serve as its lord.

The Lord of the Western Peak, Mount Hua, commands four thousand one hundred immortals and jade maidens. When you traverse the mountains and rivers under his domain, all spirits will come forth to welcome you. The Lord of Mount Hua wears a robe of white silk, a crown of Supreme Simplicity and Nine Streams, and bears the Talisman of Opening Heaven and Communing with the Perfected. He rides a white dragon to welcome you.

The Lord of the Northern Peak, Mount Heng, commands seven thousand immortal youths and jade maidens. When you enter the mountains and rivers under his jurisdiction, all spirits will come forth to welcome you. The Lord of the Northern Peak wears a robe of dark radiance, a crown of Supreme Obscurity and Yin Spirit, and bears the Talisman of Eternal Tranquility and Realization of the Perfected. He rides a black dragon to welcome you.

The Venerable Elder of Qingcheng was appointed by the Yellow Emperor to govern earthbound immortals and serve as the overseer of the Five Peaks, unifying all their ministers. The Venerable Elder commands ten thousand immortal officials. When Daoists enter his peak, the Venerable Elder wears a robe of vermilion radiance, a canopy-like crown, and bears the Seal of the Three Courts. He rides a carriage drawn by auspicious beasts, accompanied by a host of spirits, to welcome you.

The Envoy of Mount Lu was appointed by the Yellow Emperor, holding a rank comparable to the Imperial Censor. He oversees the taboos of all immortal officials, serving as the inspector of the Five Peaks. When Daoists enter his mountain, the Envoy wears a robe of vermilion elegance, a crown of level splendor, and bears the Talisman of the True Forms of the Three Heavens. He also rides a carriage drawn by auspicious beasts to welcome you.

The Reserve Lord of the Southern Peak, Mount Huo, was appointed by the Yellow Emperor as the deputy of Mount Heng. He commands thirty thousand spirits. Above, he harmonizes the qi; below, he succors the common people. He governs the water spirits by the decrees of the assembled immortals, serving as the repository of majestic authority and the object of reverence for all spirits. When Daoists enter his domain, the Reserve Lord wears a robe of azure brocade, a crown of Dawning Light, and bears the Jade Staff of the Dao Lord. He comes to welcome you, sometimes riding a carriage or a tiger, without fixed form.

The Reserve Lord of Mount Qian was appointed by the Yellow Emperor as the secondary deputy of Mount Heng, occasionally participating in governance to assist in his duties. When you enter his mountain, the Reserve Lord of Mount Qian wears embroidered robes of purple radiance, a crown of Tri-Star Spirit, and bears the Seal of the Vermilion Palace. He rides a chariot drawn by a red dragon to welcome you.

The Lords of the Auxiliary Mountains all assist the Peak Lords in governance. When Daoists enter their mountains, the Auxiliary Lords wear vermilion robes, crowns of immortal splendor, and bear the True Form Chapters of the Supreme Lord. They come to welcome you, their mounts varying without fixed form.

Dongfang Shuo said that the ancient illustrations of the true forms of the Five Peaks, including their heads and eyes, originated from the pre-Shennong era, derived from the *Eight Assemblies of the Flying Celestials* script of the Supreme Lord—a script predating even the age of bird-track writing. Without the annotations and explanations of immortals, their meanings would remain forever obscure. When Daoists wish to bear these talismans, they should select the mountain’s image and inscribe the ancient script, rolling it up and inscribing the exterior. The talisman should be worn during the first *yin* month, after establishing a seven-day fast. During the fast, the talisman is inscribed, and the offering rites follow the transmission of the method, though the invocations may be adapted to the individual.

Whenever inscribing, incense should be burned beside the image. The *True Form Chart of the Five Peaks of Lingbao* and the *Everlasting Talisman of the Three Heavens’ Supreme Lord*—when Daoists wear these, they may traverse mountains, forests, rivers, and seas, journeying across the world. All spirits will attend and protect them, none daring to obstruct. The rites of fasting, offering, and inscription follow the same name as the Five Peaks. The edict of the Supreme Dao Lord is not to be seen, but it was revealed by Dongfang Shuo.

This predates the traces of birds, resembling the scripts of the Three Sovereigns. Those who wear it should store it together with the *True Form Charts of the Five Peaks*. Only immortals may inscribe the names of mountains and their hidden features with the character "谨" (reverence); no others may do so even once.

By the command of Heaven and Earth, the hills and mounds,
May the gods protect me, the disciple, with care.
Banish harm, grant long-lasting peace,
And preserve wholeness forever.

Height and depth follow the natural contours; length and shape are drawn according to their likeness. At their origins, divine mushrooms and herbs are illustrated. Where chambers are marked, later generations may enter and exit, recognizing and recording these places in the mountains.

*Concluding the Twenty-First Scroll of the Great Method of the Numinous Treasure Sutra of Limitless Salvation*
*Beginning the Twenty-Second Scroll of the Great Method of the Numinous Treasure Sutra of Limitless Salvation*

**Summoning the Divine and Seeking Transcendence**

Whenever one recites the Five True Writings of the Numinous Treasure, visualizes the divine, and invokes the immortals—whatever one seeks—shall be heard by the Nine Heavens, and the Perfected Ones shall come to one’s chamber, granting the body transcendence.

This should be performed on the days of *jiayin* or *yimao* following the Beginning of Spring. Bathe, purify, and fast, then at dawn enter the chamber, face east, and bow nine times. Sit upright, knock the teeth nine times, and awaken the spirits within the body.

Once done, with eyes closed, visualize the Azure Thearch of Mount Tai of the Eastern Marchmount, surnamed *Sui*, whose personal name is [omitted]. His form is nine inches and nine *fen* in height, crowned with a blue jade *tongtian* coronet, clad in a feathered flying robe of azure, and riding a green dragon. He is attended by twelve jade maidens of the green waist, descending into your chamber from the east.

After a while, the Azure Thearch transforms into an infant within a cloud of green *qi*, entering your mouth with the breath and proceeding directly to your abdomen. Visualize a red *qi* arising from the heart, encircling and suffusing the liver. The green and red *qi* intermingle in primordial chaos, like auspicious clouds layered in mist. When you feel warmth suffusing the liver, swallow nine times.

Then raise your head and pray:
*"The Nine Gates of the East—
Within lies the Primordial August One."*

Ascend and descend through the Three Clarities, feasting in the Jade Chamber. Secure and pacify the numinous peaks, dispatching and directing Gou Mang. Above, govern the azure mists, nine thousand ninefold layers. Attend the feathered palanquin, twelve flying dragons in escort. To the left, green-waisted maidens attend; to the right, divine youths guard. They grasp inscribed tablets, jade texts of azure writ. They review and fix the names of immortals, reporting them to the Upper Palace. Today is most auspicious—present your words. Bear the Red Script upon your person, your name recorded in the Emperor’s Hall. May the divine and immortal be inscribed in the Green Register’s ledger. Turn above the numinous chariot to descend into my chamber. The two *qi* intermingle, transforming into an infant’s hazy form. Settle and govern the liver’s palace, summoning radiant splendor. Numinous brilliance flows and pours, bestowing a golden countenance upon the face. Sit in natural attainment, spirits and gods in communion. The body attains longevity, heaven and earth without end.

Conclude by drawing in green *qi* and swallowing nine times, then cease. Practicing this Way for nine years will summon nine green-waisted jade maidens and the numinous officials of Mount Tai in the East to descend, conveying your prayers and wishes upward to the Nine Heavens. For parents in life or death, transgressions recorded and duties assigned to the Eastern Peak—then the gods will erase the names of sins, and you shall attain liberation, ascending to the Hall of Blessings. This method is wondrous and weighty, the bridge between life and death.

Regularly perform this on the days of *bingwu* or *dingwei* after the Beginning of Summer. Bathe and purify, then enter the chamber at noon. Face south, bow three times, sit upright, and knock the teeth three times to awaken the body’s spirits. Conclude, close your eyes, and visualize the Red Thearch of Mount Heng in the South, whose surname is Rong and personal name is [omitted]. His form is three *cun* and three *fen* in height, crowned with a red jade *tongtian* coronet, clad in a feathered flying robe of cinnabar, and riding a crimson dragon. He is attended by twelve jade maidens of the red jasper, descending into your chamber from the south.

After a while, the Red Thearch transforms into a newly born infant within a cloud of red *qi*, entering your mouth with the breath and proceeding directly to your heart. Visualize a yellow *qi* arising from the spleen, encircling and suffusing the heart’s palace. The yellow and red *qi* intermingle in primordial chaos, like the dazzling radiance of blazing fire. When you feel warmth suffusing the heart, swallow three times.

Then raise your head and pray:
*"The Three Lights of the Cinnabar Heavens—
The Jade Gate of the South above.
Within lies the Great Spirit,
The Numinous Lord of the Red Thearch.
Clad in cinnabar, bearing talismanic sashes,
Flying script and feathered skirts.
Riding a crimson dragon,
Descending with the flying clouds.
On the numinous Mount Heng of the South,
Myriad gods hold him in highest honor.
Ascending and descending through the Three Clarities,
Feasting above with the Nine Maidens.
Jade maidens of the red jasper,
Jade youths guarding the true.
Grasping inscribed tablets,
Crimson ledgers and jade texts.
Reviewing the ranks of immortals,
Weighing and reporting above.
Today is most auspicious,
The numinous peaks open to immortals.
Turn above the exalted spirits,
Descend through my three gates.
Transform into an infant,
Settling the heart and pacifying the soul.
The two *qi* intermingle,
Entwining my life’s root.
Ever with Zhu Rong,
Riding the luminous clouds.
Wandering the Southern River,
Heaven and earth enduring forever."*

Conclude by drawing in red *qi* and swallowing three times, then cease. Practicing this Way will dissolve all karmic bonds of the Southern Peak, releasing punishments and dispersing judgments, ascending to the Heavenly Palace. This method is wondrous and weighty, opening the passage between life and death.

Regularly perform this on the days of *wuchen*, *wuxu*, *jichou*, or *jiwei* after the Spring Equinox, Summer Solstice, Autumn Equinox, or Winter Solstice. Bathe and purify, then enter the chamber as the sun’s rays enter. Face the king and bow twelve times, sit upright, and knock the teeth twelve times to awaken the body’s spirits. Conclude, close your eyes, and visualize the Yellow Thearch of Mount Song in the Center, whose surname is Dan and personal name is [omitted]. His form is one *chi* and two *cun* in height, crowned with a yellow jade *tongtian* coronet, clad in a feathered flying robe of yellow, and riding a yellow dragon. He is attended by twelve jade maidens of the yellow silk, descending into your chamber from the Central Peak.

After a while, the Yellow Thearch transforms into a newly born infant within a cloud of yellow *qi*, entering your mouth with the breath and proceeding directly to the spleen’s palace. Visualize a white *qi* arising from the lungs, encircling and suffusing the spleen’s palace. The yellow and white *qi* intermingle in primordial chaos, like yellow clouds swirling in the heavens. When you feel warmth suffusing the spleen, swallow twelve times.

Pray:
*"The Yellow Origin of the Center,
Governing the Four Numinous Ones."*

The Central Mountains of Wu and Ji, primordial essence of the supreme origin.
The Great Divine Yellow Thearch, riding a three-harnessed flying chariot,
Twelve yellow dragons ascending to feast in the Three Clarities.
Jade maidens attend as guards, divine youths serve as messengers.
Opening the mountain to reveal the chart, submitting to immortals to fix the name.
Roaming the Central Peak, the Four Kings unfold their numinous power.
Turning to descend in a winding path, streaming to irrigate my form.
Merging and transforming, the aged Thearch becomes an infant.
Pacifying and settling the Yellow Palace, the palace repository flourishes in splendor.
The body grows wondrous hair, luminous within and without.
The perfected ones commune, penetrating the Nine Clarities.
Attaining to ride the yellow chariot, ascending to fly in the Jade Court.

Conclude by drawing in yellow *qi* and swallowing twelve times, then cease.

Practicing this Dao, the numinous officials of the Central Peak descend to your chamber, sending twelve jade maidens of the yellow silk to open and communicate your passages, reporting above to the Nine Heavens. Parents of life and death, records of crimes and punishments bound to the Central Peak—all are dissolved and erased. Your name ascends to the immortal register, you depart the Earthly Prison, rise into the Hall of Blessings, and life and death unfold in harmony, delivering countless beings.

Always on the *gengshen* or *xinyou* days following the Beginning of Autumn, at dusk, bathe and purify in fasting. Enter your chamber, face west, and bow seven times. Sit evenly, knock the teeth seven times, and awaken the spirits within your body.

Conclude, then close your eyes and visualize the White Thearch of Mount Huayin in the Western Peak, surnamed Chong, whose personal name is [omitted]. His form is seven *cun* and seven *fen* in height, crowned with a plain jade *tongtian* coronet, clad in a feathered flying robe of white, and riding a white dragon. He is attended by twelve jade maidens of the white silk, descending into your chamber from the Western Prison.

After a while, the White Thearch transforms into a newly born infant within a cloud of white *qi*, entering your mouth with the breath and proceeding directly to the lung’s palace. Visualize a black *qi* arising from the kidneys, encircling and suffusing the lung’s palace. The white and black *qi* intermingle in primordial chaos, like auspicious clouds layering the heavens. When you feel warmth suffusing the lungs, swallow seven times. Look up and pray:

*"The Seven Qi’s Heaven,
The Hall of White and Yellow Gold.
Great Divine White Thearch,
Pacifying and settling the four directions.
The numinous mountain of Huayin,
Called the Divine King.
White feathered flying skirt,
Raising banners and driving dragons.
Ascending to roam the Dark Clarity,
Entering and exiting the Flowery Palace.
Governing the immortal registers,
Arranging the tablets to address the directions.
On this auspicious day,
The myriad sages feast on the peak.
Roaming the Nine Radiant Clouds,
Streaming and scattering their brilliance.
Golden essence gleaming,
White stone vast and overflowing.
Opening the mountain to observe the numinous,
The divine unfolds in the four quarters.
Wishing for the Dao, wishing for immortality,
Wishing for life, wishing for longevity.
When the highest wishes converge,
There is nothing that is not auspiciously prosperous.
At dusk, gather the perfected and communicate,
Transforming my form.
Changing and forming of itself,
Soaring together with the *qi*.
The body flies lightly aloft,
Ascending to the Purple Chamber."*

Conclude by drawing in white *qi* and swallowing seven times, then cease.

Practicing this Dao, the numinous officials of the Western Peak and the White Thearch descend in truth. Seven jade maidens of the white silk open and communicate your numinous passages, and all your prayers ascend to the Nine Heavens. Parents of life and death, records of crimes and punishments bound to the Western Peak—all are dissolved, the names of offenses erased. Your name ascends to the immortal register, you depart the Five Paths, seek to rise into the Hall of Blessings, and life and death unfold in deliverance. Blessings come naturally.

Always on the *renz*i or *guihai* days following the Beginning of Winter, at midnight, bathe and purify in fasting. Enter your chamber, face north, and bow five times. Sit evenly, knock the teeth five times, and awaken the spirits within your body.

Conclude, then close your eyes and visualize the Black Thearch of Mount Heng in the Northern Peak, surnamed Chen, whose personal name is [omitted]. His form is five *cun* and five *fen* in height, crowned with a dark jade *tongtian* coronet, clad in a feathered flying robe of black, and riding a black dragon. He is attended by twelve jade maidens of the Great Mystery, descending into your chamber from the Northern Peak.

After a while, the Black Thearch transforms into a newly born infant within a cloud of black *qi*, entering your mouth with the breath and proceeding directly to the kidney’s palace. Visualize a green *qi* arising from the liver, encircling and suffusing the kidney’s palace. The green and black *qi* intermingle in primordial chaos, like azure clouds layering the mist. When you feel warmth suffusing the kidneys, swallow five times. Look up and pray:

*"The Five Qi’s Dark Heaven,
Supreme origin flowing in essence..."*

Gather *qi* and condense the numinous—this is called the Immortal Hut.
Securely stationed at Northern Heng, it is the Black Thearch’s domain of roaming.
Reveling in the northern wastes, you ascend with dragons afloat.
Today is an auspicious day: the myriad spirits open the celestial charts.
The Five *Qi* linger and circle; felicitous clouds spread in all four directions.
Immortal youths hold jade tablets; the Great Mystery transmits the talisman.
Inscribe my name in the immortal register, inscribed in golden script on high.
Returning to the true and curving descent, merge with the infant form.
The two *qi* intermingle and descend; I behold my body with penetrating vision.
The Dark and Mysterious One leads me by the hand, and immortals become my companions.
Forever partaking of Heaven and Earth, through ten thousand kalpas without end.

Conclude by drawing in the black *qi* and swallowing five times. Cease.

By practicing this Way, the numinous officials of Northern Heng and the Black Thearch descend in truth. Five jade maidens of the Great Mystery are assigned to serve you, conveying petitions and supplications upward to the Nine Heavens. Your parents in life and death, the records of your offenses and punishments—all bound to Northern Heng—are thereby absolved. You attain deliverance from the Three Evil Paths and ascend to the celestial halls. This is the supreme and wondrous method, universally delivering boundless beings.

When practicing this Way, maintain a serene mind and focused intention; the numinous and the true readily respond. Mastering its forms and procedures, within a year you will witness spirits coming and going in all directions. Officials will welcome you; demonic forces will disperse and submit, no longer daring to approach. Your mind will grow keen and your thoughts wise; you will discern fortune and misfortune for yourself. The Five Peaks and Five Thearchs will become your constant companions and guests. Communing with the divine, you will effortlessly attain immortality.

The High Ascent of the Sun and Moon Way

The Supreme Prime of the Southern Culmen said: You have received the essentials of the Highest Ascent and the practice of the Three Ways—the Way of Yellow *Qi* and Yang Essence. By ingesting the numinous radiance, sipping the imperial blossoms, and gazing upward to consume the flying roots, you store the Seven Luminaries within the Purple Splendor and traverse the Three Ways at the Golden Gate, penetrating the Abyssal Radiance. You behold the round and square of the sun and moon, perceive the vermilion steps in the Cavern Yang, and enter to refine Yang within the Vast Cold. You ascend the Seven Treasures at the Dark Garden, climb the flying ladder at the Cloud Observatory, absorb Yang essence from the Floating Black, and gather yellow *qi* from the Lush Unitary. Beside the Golden Wings on the Lofty Tree, you turn the stone’s radiance to illumine your countenance. Cultivating and mastering the Numinous Chart, you thereby summon the divine and true.

Thus the Three Radiant Ones descend in splendor; the Seven Essences flank your chariot. The Five Numinous Ones intertwine as sashes; the Four Directors compile the scriptures. The Western Tortoise determines the records; your name is inscribed in the Highest Dawn. Therefore, you ascend to the Southern Culmen.

This Way is lofty and wondrous, not to be discussed by mediocre men of narrow learning. You should study it carefully and practice accordingly.

---

For the High Ascent of the Sun and Moon Way, observe a pure fast for fifty days, severing all worldly affairs. Seek seclusion and stillness, dwelling only where the first light of dawn appears. If the sky is overcast and the sun and moon are not visible, or if you are in a secluded place, simply purify your mind and visualize within the chamber where you lie. The key lies in rectifying the mind and concentrating your thoughts—where the mind reaches, nothing remains obstructed.

When closing your eyes to visualize, do so to the point of vivid semblance. "Closing the eyes" means neither fully shut nor fully open, allowing you to perceive the light and form of the sun and moon. Practice in secrecy; do not let others see or know. If observed, the numinous radiance will not descend.

When cultivating the High Way, first sever all worldly ties. After beginning the fast, maintain utmost purity. It is especially fitting to prepare a separate chamber, its door opening to the east. Alternatively, have a window facing east, and the bed should also face east. The sleeping area must be free of filth and disorder, and no other garments should be strewn about—such is not a place where the Supreme Perfected may descend.

The sun and moon are the mutual reflections of all methods of Yin and Yang; visualize them both. The essence lies in pure and unwavering concentration, without distraction.

The Perfected of the Primordial Simplicity said: When you store the essence of the sun, the Five Thearchs hold in their mouths the *Yu Yi* Text of the Supreme. Only when this Way is accomplished will you behold the Lord within the sun. Without it, your efforts are in vain, and you will only vex yourself.

The Perfected of the Primordial Simplicity said: When you store the essence of the moon, the Five Ladies hold in their mouths the *Jie Lin* Chapter of the Supreme. Only when this Way is accomplished will you behold the Lady within the moon. Without it, your efforts are in vain, and you will only grieve yourself.

The above two passages were transmitted by the Perfected of the Primordial Simplicity, who received them from the Supreme Thearch. The *Hidden Writings of the Supreme* states: When visualizing, hold the text; the Thearch says to contain it in the mouth.

The Perfected of the Primordial Simplicity taught Lord Pei: When visualizing, hold one text in the mouth and grasp another in the hand, practicing both simultaneously, each transcribed within the scripture. The two ascent methods and their taboo names are not to be intermingled with other words.

For the sun method, write in vermilion on blue-green paper, about two *cun* in width, and store it in a crimson pouch. When visualizing, hold it in the right hand. For the moon method, write with orpiment on blue-green paper, and store it in a yellow silk pouch, holding it in the right hand. Additionally, transcribe each in vermilion and yellow on fine blue-green silk, about one *cun* in width, with the characters as small as possible. Roll tightly and seal with wax. When visualizing, hold one in the mouth. After completing the practice, wipe it with wine and place it in a fragrant box.

The true taboo name of the Lord of *Yu Yi*:
The Supreme Thearch of the Red *Qi* within the Sun, taboo name Jiang Che Liang, style Gao Qian Shuang.

When visualizing, know this, but do not casually invoke this title. The sacred scriptures contain no methods for visualization or cultivation regarding this.

The Green Thearch within the sun, named Yuan Chang Wu, style Zhao Long Tao, appears as an infant, clad in a green jade brocade cloak, an azure floral flying feather skirt, and a morning coronet of emerald hibiscus.

The Red Thearch, taboo name Dan Ling Zhi, style Lü Hong Ying, appears as an infant, clad in a crimson jade brocade cloak, a vermilion floral flying feather skirt, and a vermilion talismanic luminous coronet.

The White Thearch, taboo name Hao Yu Jiang, style Hui Jin Xia, wears a white jade brocade cloak, a white feathered flying floral skirt, and a luminous white hibiscus coronet.

The Black Thearch, taboo name Cheng Zeng Chun, style Xuan Lü Yan, appears as an infant, clad in a black jade brocade cloak, a black feathered flying floral skirt, and a black mountain hibiscus coronet.

The Yellow Thearch, taboo name Shou Yi Fu, style Biao Hui Xiang, appears as an infant, clad in a yellow jade brocade cloak, a yellow feathered flying floral skirt, and a purple coronet of supporting numinosity.

At dawn, don your cap and robes, burn incense, face the sun, and bow twice. Perform ablutions.

When finished, hold the scripture text in your mouth with the first character facing inward, sit upright, and align with the sun’s circular radiance. Offer incense, then silently invoke the taboo name and style of the Supreme August True Lord and bow in your heart. After bowing, close your eyes. Once closed, do not open them again. Hold your breath for ten cycles, then sit squarely facing the sun, hands resting on your knees, palms upturned. Hold the scripture text in your left hand, curling your thumb into a fist, and do the same with your right hand. Next, swallow the sunlight ten times. Visualize the sunlight entering your mouth and being consumed. Envision the sun’s core as crimson *qi* with nine purple rays. Silently intone: *"Nine luminous spirits of the radiant essence."* The nine rays descend upon your face; slightly part your lips, gently inhale, and swallow them ten times. When done, hold your breath and imagine the radiance within your abdomen ascending to connect with the *Niwan* palace and descending to permeate the viscera, illuminating your form and penetrating both within and without. Sustain this vision of light until the practice concludes, ensuring it does not dissipate.

Next, softly call the name and style of the Thearch, just loud enough for your own ears to hear. Then visualize the lunar soul as nine circular orbs of yellow, slightly smaller than the sun, floating within the solar *qi* like a shimmering reflection—do not perceive it as solid. Though its form is unspoken, sense its presence as if a spirit responds. Silently recite the incantation:
*"Lunar soul, spirit of the soul,
Warm and towering, the Terrace of Xiao.
Grant me access to the Heaven of the Solar Cavern.
On the eastern mound of Dongmeng’s long ridge,
I receive the divine radiance’s scripture,
Bear the talisman of the Nine Realms,
Feast on the azure essence of solar nectar,
Drink the cloud-green’s richness,
Recline in the city of the Eight Poles,
Ascend the Terrace of Luminous Perfection,
Sit in the Hall of Verdant Forests,
Chant the Jade Dawn’s verses."*

Mentally recite this without uttering a sound. Then silently pray: *"May I ascend with the Five Thearchs and the solar soul’s spirit, riding the luminous clouds to the Solar Palace."*

Next, close your eyes and visualize the Azure Thearch emerging from the sun upon rays of light, standing to your left, and silently invoke his taboo name and style. Then visualize the Crimson Thearch emerging from the sun upon rays of light, standing to your right, and silently invoke his taboo name and style. Next, visualize the White Thearch emerging from the sun upon rays of light, standing behind you, and silently invoke his taboo name and style. Then visualize the Black Thearch emerging from the sun upon rays of light, standing above your left hand, and silently invoke his taboo name and style. Finally, visualize the Yellow Thearch emerging from the sun upon rays of light, standing above your right hand, and silently invoke his taboo name and style. Since your hands hold the scripture, they cannot open; the Thearchs stand upon them, facing you. Visualize their robes and colors vividly. Once all five are present, envision the Five Thearchs in their five positions, their forms and attire appearing simultaneously. Knock your teeth five times and swallow saliva nine times.

Softly recite, just loud enough for your own ears to hear:
*"Crimson furnace, cinnabar landscape,
Ninefold radiance of circular splendor.
Great luminance dawns,
Glorious and resplendent with vermilion essence.
The Five Thearchs initiate the dawn,
Illuminating the myriad beings of the cavernous void.
Behold the descent of the perfected,
Vast and boundless, without measure.
Circulate the *qi*, refine the hues,
Flowing through the five forms.
May my spirit transform,
And my six viscera flourish.
Attend the descending clouds,
The nine chariots of the solar mirror.
Ascend to the Solar Palace,
And unite with the Thearch’s spirit."*

When finished, visualize the solar soul riding the sunlight toward your face, stopping nine inches away. Envision a spirit within it, then knock your teeth three times and swallow saliva three times. Softly recite again: *"Lunar soul, spirit of the soul,"* as before.

Next, visualize the chariot of the solar mirror, drawn by nine crimson dragons, emerging from the sunlight and arriving before you—its form like a carriage’s yoke. Forget your own body. Then imagine the Black and Yellow Thearchs descending from your hands to stand on either side, and forget them as well. The Five Thearchs take your hands, and you rise together, ascending into the chariot. Envision the lunar soul also within it, amid the radiance. Ride the rays of light, swiftly soaring until you reach the sun’s core. Still your mind, cease visualization, and enter a state of profound absorption, as if dwelling within the sun for a long while. Finally, swallow saliva fourteen times.

When finished, open your eyes. Do not look directly at the sun again. All these procedures must be thoroughly practiced beforehand. From the beginning to the end of a session, one must not harbor doubts or consult the text. After one year of practice, semblances appear; after two years, forms manifest; after three years, they descend; after four years, clarity and penetration arise, and one’s face shines with jade-like radiance. After five years, one attains perfection. After eleven years, one may ride the cloud chariot with its feathered canopy, drawn by a host of dragons under command, ascending to the solar palace to receive the scripture and be named an Upper Clarity Perfected. One is then granted twenty-six jade lads and twenty-four jade maidens.

The Perfected’s true name of the Lady of Radiant Essence is *"Moon’s Yellow Qi, Supreme August Divine Mother,"* with the personal name *Yaodao Zhi* and the style *Yuhui Tiao*. Hold this in mind, but do not casually invoke these titles, for the scripture’s profound secrecy contains no method for their visualization.

The Lady of the Azure Thearch in the Moon has the personal name *Yine Zhu* and the style *Fenyan Ying*. Her form is like that of an infant, clad in a robe of azure-flowered jade brocade with a shawl of kingfisher-feather phoenix patterns and a flying-feather skirt. Her hair is gathered into a three-cornered cloud-toppled chignon, with the rest hanging down to her waist.

The Lady of the Vermilion Thearch has the personal name *Yiyi Liao* and the style *Wanyan Xu*. Her form is like that of an infant, clad in a robe of cinnabar-budded jade brocade with a shawl of vermilion-flowered phoenix patterns and a flying-feather skirt. Her hair is gathered into a three-cornered cloud-toppled chignon.

The Lady of the White Thearch has the personal name *Lingsu Lan* and the style *Yulian Hua*. She wears a robe of white jade brocade with four-dragon motifs and a flying-flower skirt of white-feathered simurgh patterns. Her hair is gathered into a three-cornered cloud-toppled chignon.

The Lady of the Black Thearch has the personal name *Jielian Qiao* and the style *Chunli Jin*. She wears a robe of dark jade brocade with nine-layered cloud patterns and a flying-flower skirt of black-feathered dragon motifs. Her hair is gathered into a three-cornered cloud-toppled chignon.

The Lady of the Yellow Thearch has the personal name *Qingying Jin* and the style *Jiongding Rong*. Her form is like that of an infant, clad in a robe of yellow-cloud mountain-patterned brocade with a shawl of green-feathered phoenix embroidery and a skirt of the same. Her hair is gathered into a three-cornered cloud-toppled chignon, with the rest hanging down to her waist.

On a quiet night, don your cap and robes, burn incense, and bow twice toward the moon. Whether at moonrise or dawn, adjust your position to face it as appropriate.

When the moon first appears two or three days after the new moon, as soon as the sun sets and the moon becomes visible, you may begin. As the moon rises higher, wait until the sunlight has completely faded and the moonlight grows bright before proceeding. During the dark of the moon, when the lunar form has vanished, there is naturally no practice to be performed. If the moon is not visible within the chamber, go outside to the courtyard or beneath the eaves. Should clouds or rain obscure the moon while indoors, hold the scripture in your mouth with the first character facing inward, kneel long toward the moon, and visualize the personal name and style of the Supreme Thearch’s Divine Mother. Rise, press your hands to your heart, and bow. If the moon is eclipsed on the night of the full moon, do not proceed until the eclipse has passed.

After bowing, close your eyes. From this point, keep them closed until the practice is complete, without opening them midway. Hold your breath for nine cycles, sit upright facing the moon, place your hands palms-up on your knees, hold the scripture in your right hand, and clench your left hand into a fist. Lift your face toward the moon and hold for nine breaths, as long as forty-five pulse beats. Swallow the moonlight nine times, imagining it entering your mouth. Visualize the moon containing a radiant yellow *qi* and the white light of eight luminous rays. Silently intone: *"Moon essence, night essence, eight rays."* Let the eight rays pour onto your face, then slightly part your lips to inhale and swallow them nine times. Conclude by holding your breath, imagining the radiance within your abdomen ascending to the *niwan* and descending to the viscera, illuminating your form and penetrating both within and without. Maintain this luminous brilliance until the practice ends, ensuring it does not dissipate. Let your breath be so soft that only your ears perceive it.

Next, visualize the solar soul as a vermilion expanse of protective light, the size of the moon, floating within the lunar *qi*—ethereal and shimmering, without solid form. Though the soul’s spirit has no fixed shape, sense its presence as if responding to a divine resonance. Silently recite: *"Solar soul, spirit essence, pearl radiance, crimson youth. Guide me westward to the Gate of the Six Ridges, into the Jade Palace of Harmonious Dawn, the Eight-Stringed White Mound, the Upper Chamber of Eight Sceneries. Grant me the talisman of Ten Brightnesses, the insignia of the Flowing Star’s nocturnal glow. Let me sit in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, ascend the Terrace of Seven Spirits, receive the moon’s cloud-ointment, partake of the purple nectar of Jasper Perfection, chant the verses of the Exalted, and recite the words of the Jade Dawn."* Keep these thoughts within your heart without uttering them aloud.

Next, silently recite: *"May I, together with the Five Thearchs’ Ladies and the solar soul’s spirit essence, ascend the moon palace upon flying clouds."* Close your eyes again and visualize the Lady of the Blue Thearch arriving upon the moon’s rays to your left, silently invoking her personal name and style. Then visualize the Lady of the Red Thearch arriving upon the moon’s rays to your right, facing left, silently invoking her personal name and style. Next, visualize the Lady of the White Thearch emerging from the moonlight behind you, silently invoking her personal name and style. Then visualize the Lady of the Black Thearch arriving from the moonlight to your left hand, standing upon it with a firm grip, facing you, silently invoking her personal name and style. Finally, visualize the Lady of the Yellow Thearch arriving from the moonlight to your right hand, holding the scripture upon it, standing and facing you, silently invoking her personal name and style. All Five Thearchs’ Ladies appear simultaneously in their forms and attire.

Then click your teeth nine times and swallow saliva nine times. Softly recite: *"Yellow essence unfurls its splendor, primordial Yin’s inner insignia. Reflecting upon the Great Mystery, it stirs the ten thousand directions. Scattering the misty chill winds, the Seven Dawns suspend their jade. The Three Convergences of Yin revolve, heaven and earth exhale their light. Purple brilliance descends, floating blossoms fill the nine skies. Round luminosity bestows its hues, the Six Qi transform and commune. The Five Thearchs’ Ladies tread clouds and embrace the wind. Clouds drape the dense silk, jade pendants and pearl ornaments adorn. Feathered skirts brush the heavens, soaring through the void to fan the east. The soaring tree unfolds its dawn, the canopy’s branches flourish like the sacred fern. Clouds refine and polish, aiding and nurturing the Lord of the Wood. Gazing through ten thousand miles, their shade shelters the Five Bodies. Soul harmonizes with spirit, the Six Mysteries fill the clouds. Returning from age to infancy, jade’s radiance restores youth. Timely riding the flowing bell, ten dragons soar through the clouds. Ascending to the moon palace, I am established as the Guardian Thearch."*

Visualize the solar soul arriving upon the moon’s rays before you, nine inches from your face, sensing the presence of a spirit within. Click your teeth nine times and swallow saliva nine times. Softly recite again: *"Solar soul, spirit essence."* As before. Calm your heart and focus your intent to see within the moon a chariot of flowing bells, its form resembling a carriage’s shaft, with flying clouds preceding it. Ten dragons draw it in unison, connected to the clouds, gently emerging from the radiance. When it arrives before you, turn the dragon-chariot’s pole. The Ladies of the Black and Yellow Thearchs descend to stand on either side, each holding your hands outward. Then visualize all Five Ladies assisting you as you rise, ascending together into the chariot and sitting within. The solar soul is also upon the chariot, and within the radiance, you ride swiftly toward the moon. Still your heart and cease visualization, entering a state of reverie where you forget your form, as if dwelling within the moon for a long while. Swallow saliva thirty times, then open your eyes, but do not gaze at the moon again.

All these procedures must be thoroughly practiced beforehand. Remain seated until the practice is complete, without doubt or consulting the text.

With one year of practice, semblances appear; with two years, forms manifest; with three years, descent occurs; with four years, penetrating vision arises, and the body emits flowing radiance. At five years, one attains perfection; at eleven years, one gains the reins of the dark dragon-chariot, ascending to the Lunar Palace to become an Upper Clarity Perfected, granted twenty-six Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens.

The *Scripture of the Primordial Perfected* transmits the two affairs of the Pure Numinous Perfected, Master Pei, and the Chapter of the Supreme Thearch’s *Yuyi* and *Jielin*, which summon the spirits of the sun and moon, ascending to the sun and moon, and the Dao of soaring through the celestial light of the Great Void. All ride cloud-chariots with feathered canopies, driving a host of dragons to ascend to the Purple Court of August Heaven.

The *Inner Vision of the Central Realm* states: "If you wish to walk the void, visualize the King of the Sun and Moon. If you wish to ascend to the Pure and Numinous, visualize the Five Stars." This is the meaning of secluded chambers and hidden practice, never leaving the courtyard.

The *Plain Memorial of the Vermilion Talisman* says: "Great is *Yuyi*! Wondrous is *Jielin*! They are unseen by any but the Highest Perfected, unheard of by any but the Highest Immortals. By the spirits of the sun, moon, and Five Essences, one rides dragons to walk the void, treading luminous clouds, and thus ascends with the Five Thearchs to enter the Gate of Heaven. If one hears of this, take care not to speak of it idly."

Here ends the twenty-second scroll of the *Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure Scripture of Limitless Salvation*.
Beginning of the twenty-third scroll of the *Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure Scripture of Limitless Salvation*.

The *Feast of Primordial Harmony*

Formerly, the Mystic Master, the Lord of the Azure Lad, received this from the Celestial Thearch of the Grand Tenuity. It is also called *The Scripture of Cinnabar and Golden Essence, the Water Mother of Stone Radiance*.

At sunrise, face east toward the sun, knock the teeth nine times, and silently intone the names of the sun’s soul and the five thearchs:

*"Sun-soul, Pearl Radiance,
Verdant sheen illumined.
Crimson Lad of returning mist,
Mystic flame in whirlwind form."*

Having recited these sixteen characters, close the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize the five-colored streaming mists within the sun descending to envelop the entire body, down to the feet. Then visualize the five brilliances ascending to the crown, where the five-colored streaming mists of sunlight all enter the mouth. Again, within the sun’s radiant mist, perceive a purple *qi*, large as the pupil of the eye, layered in tens, resplendent amid the five lights—this is called *Flying Root Water Mother*. Together with the five *qi*, it enters the mouth. Facing the sun, swallow the mist forty-five times. After swallowing the *qi*, swallow the saliva nine times and knock the teeth nine times.

Softly recite the incantation:

*"Crimson crucible, cinnabar *qi*,
Mystic heaven nurtures essence.
Firm receives the yielding,
Fiery water’s yin flower.
Sun’s primordial radiance,
Named Great Illumination.
Nine yangs transform as one,
Dual mists arise together.
Congeal the soul, harmonize the spirit,
Essence of the five *qi*.
Within, the five thearchs are born,
Riding light to govern form.
Gather the flying in emptiness,
Pluck the root to attain fullness.
Head draped in dragon-flower,
Clad in vermilion, girded in azure.
Reins of crow, flowing mystery,
Mist illumining the Upper Clarity.
Bestowed jade tablets,
Golden portals, jade names.
Feast on morning blossoms,
Merge with the perfected in numinosity.
Ascend as a flying immortal to the Grand Tenuity,
Rising to the Purple Court."*

After the incantation, bow twice toward the sun.

This supreme Dao is the fellowship of true immortals. Among ten thousand, not one knows the name of the sun’s soul. This Dao is mystically accomplished—those who consume blood and foul flesh cannot hear of it.

On overcast days without sun, perform this in a clean place within your chamber, visualizing as before. Pure and refined Daoists, those who profoundly connect with the upper realms, need not wait for the sun’s appearance to practice.

If a Daoist abstains from grains, maintains perpetual fasts on the Five Peaks, severs worldly ties, and deeply aspires to purity and truth, daily consuming the sun-root’s mist and swallowing the essence of the Great Yang, they will immediately feel their body suffused with jade-like luster and their face aglow with streaming light.

For those entangled in worldly affairs, unable to still the body, or whose hearts are bound by the nets of glory, practice on the first, third, fifth, ninth, thirteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month—ten times in a month. These are the days when the sun’s soul descends to connect with the *Flying Root*. Practicing for eighteen years, the Upper Clarity will record you with golden perfection, polish you with jade radiance, and appoint you as a Perfected, soaring through the great void, riding the three flowery essences to illumine the world below.

*The Grand Tenuity’s Talisman for Ingesting Solar Qi to Open Luminous Numinosity*
*(Inscribed in vermilion on azure silk)*

The incantation states:
*"Great Tenuity’s Cinnabar Script, named ‘Opening Luminosity.’*
*Summon the sun’s upper soul to transform this form.*
*At dawn, attire yourself with reverence, beginning in the round courtyard.*
*Flying Flower and Water Mother, sun-root and golden essence—*
*purple radiance streaming as light, styled the Five Spirits."*

First, announce to the sun’s soul and inscribe the talisman. When ingesting it, hold the breath, grasp the talisman in the left hand, and silently recite the incantation. Upon completion, swallow the talisman.

The method for gathering and ingesting the yin-flower and moon’s essence:
The first is the yellow *qi*, the yang essence concealing the sky and the moon’s hidden essence. At the moment the moon first appears, face west toward it, click the teeth ten times, and silently invoke the names of the moon’s soul and the Five Ladies:

*"Alas, the soul’s dim glow, fragrant and lustrous in the void.*
*Gently wafting, spirit’s gate, luxuriant blossoms intertwined.*
*Pure golden essence gleaming, radiant countenance atop the terrace."*

Repeat thrice, reciting the twenty-four characters in full. Then close the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize the moon’s five-colored streaming essence descending to envelop the body, reaching down to the feet. Next, envision the five *qi* ascending to the crown. As the moon’s light and five-colored essence flow into the mouth, perceive within the moon’s luminous essence a yellow *qi*, large as the pupil of an eye, dozens in number, trailing amid the five-colored radiance of the moon’s essence—these are the *Flying Yellow* and the moon’s flowery essence. Together with the five *qi*, they enter the mouth. Face the moon and swallow the essence fifty times. Upon completion, swallow the saliva ten times and click the teeth ten more.

The minor incantation:
*"Yellow essence, mysterious splendor, primordial yin’s upper *qi*.*
*Scattering and flourishing upon the cloud terrace, the numinous gathers in the stomach.*
*Vacuous waves, the gate’s brilliance, upright and irrigating the vessel.*
*Moon’s essence, night’s scene, the Mysterious Palace’s exalted adornment.*
*Five Lords and Ladies, each safeguarding their maternal station.*
*The Red Child flies in, the Infant follows in succession.*
*Revolving yin’s triple union, light and mystery pervade the ten thousand directions.*
*Harmonizing the hun and restraining the po, the five wombs flow freely.*
*Riding the rosy clouds, flying essence, soaring in the void to the east.*
*At the crown, bind the numinous cloud; the luminous flower summons the wind.*
*On the left, bear the Dragon Talisman; on the right, gird the Tiger Seal.*
*Phoenix plumes and crimson sashes, jade pendants and golden earrings.*
*The soaring tree’s branches entwine, styled the Wood King.*
*The divine turtle controls the root, waxing and waning in turn.*
*Bright essence inwardly illumines; mysterious water spouts forth a bridge.*
*Bestowed the jade tablet’s script, inscribed in the Cloud Chamber.*
*Ingesting the moon’s flower, merging with the Perfected as one.*
*Flying immortal of the Purple Tenuity, ascending to pay court to the Supreme August."*

Upon finishing the incantation, bow twice toward the moon. Visualize the sun and moon seated or standing as they please within the immortal palace, where none but the Perfected of that time know the moon’s soul’s name. On overcast nights without moonlight, perform this indoors. The essential method, like the practice of ingesting moonlight, should be done nightly, and one will swiftly perceive the body emanating light, the eyes brimming with flying essence.

The essential method’s lunar days: the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth, fourteenth, sixteenth, eighteenth, twentieth, twenty-second, and twenty-fourth—eleven times in a month—will likewise lead to transcendence. These are the days when yin essence flies and converges, the three *qi* overflow, the moon’s water crystallizes into flower, and the Yellow Spirit descends to connect. Practicing for eighteen years, the Upper Clarity will refine the hun and transmute the po, illumining them with jade light, riding the dark reins of radiance to soar through the great void.

*The Great Tenuity’s Talisman for Ingesting Moon Essence and the Mysterious Yin’s Birth*
*(Inscribed in yellow on azure silk)*

This talisman is ingested at midnight on the night of the moon’s waning, facing east. First, announce to the moon’s soul. At the time of ingestion, first take the *Opening Luminosity* talisman, then the moon talisman. Hold the breath, grasp the talisman in the left hand, and silently intone:

*"Purple Tenuity’s Yellow Script, named ‘Great Mystery.’*
*Summon the moon’s flowery water to nourish the po and harmonize the hun.*
*In the square’s midst, attend with reverence, issuing from the Mysterious Opening.*
*Concealing the sky and veiling the moon, the Five Spirit Ladies—*
*nine beams of flying light illumine the Muddy Pellet."*

Upon finishing the incantation, ingest the talisman.

The Dark Master, the Perfected Lord of the Azure Lad, prostrated himself and advanced on his knees before the Golden Gate’s August Lord, persistently entreating the Supreme Dao. At that moment, the Sage Lord pushed aside his desk, reclined, and suddenly sighed, saying: "Your earnest words hasten the mysterious; your sincerity has come to enlightenment. You have applied your heart to the utmost." Thereupon, he pointed to the earth’s bounds, moved by compassion. Then, taking up the cloud-hook zither, he strummed it. Its pure resonance gathered in emptiness, cascading into a hundred tones, jade vibrations echoing through the nine voids, piercing and illuminating the Great Empyrean. He sang the *Great Cavern’s Divine Continent* hymn, the *Congealing Hun* melody, the *Mysterious Eulogy’s* numinous verses—celestial rhythms of the subtle and inaudible, drinking in the luminous and impalpable *qi*, its harmonious sound pure and ethereal. The lyrics:

*"Mysterious emptiness, the Upper Clarity’s *qi*,*
*the Three Essences soaring with flowery radiance.*
*Profound resonance opens the spirit’s gate,*
*the Seven Portals’ feathered script takes flight.*
*Vast and open, gazing upon the Cinnabar Empyrean,*
*the limpid and desolate reveal the workings of the dark.*
*Those who awaken to the mysterious assembly*
*soar westward toward the Great Yang.*
*The empty terrace, the Great Cavern’s wilds,*
*the secluded and transcendent, the orchid’s brilliance.*
*Shedding the obscuring cloud-wheel,*
*the abandoned dwelling naturally connects to the dark.*
*In the lofty assembly at the Mysterious Dawn’s gate,*
*prostrate, pay court to the Jade August.*
*The spirit’s radiance responds to the numinous decree,*
*the empty drum resounds with the jade bell.*
*Nine reins loosen the cloud chariot,*
*carefree upon the Purple Rosy Peak.*
*The Cinnabar Mound opens the Azure Chamber,*
*the Green Court unfolds the Five Rooms.*
*The Golden Gate gleams with towering splendor,*
*the misty grove, the Upper Clarity’s palace.*
*Savor this sun and moon’s flower,*
*attain that formless method.*
*The mysterious reaches the Three Spirits’ awakening,*
*desolate amid the kalpa’s blade.*
*Why sit in the path’s midst,*
*the Five Difficulties riding your breast?*
*Why not mount the Red Infant,*
*ride my Muddy Pellet Lord?*
*Neither dying nor living,*
*neither beginning nor ending."*

When the Sage Lord finished singing, he invited the Azure Lad to be seated, offering the nectar of flowing rosy clouds, the fruit of linked steel, the white seeds of the *wei* tree, and the crimson wood’s azure fruit. Then he commanded the Five Elders, the Upper Perfected of the Immortal Capital’s Left Duke, to open the cloud-brocade pouch of purple pistil and jade slips, and present this sacred scripture, the *Purple Text’s Upper Canon*, to the Azure Lad.

Only those who bear the jade name of the Mystic Palace and ever serve as Perfected Ones may receive this transmission.

**Numinous Scripture of Jade Sound Absorbing Heavenly Qi**
*"The ancestral Dao’s mysterious truth—*
as before."

The Mystic Master said: At sunrise, face the sun, first visualize the five viscera clearly, then silently recite the numinous chapter’s *Jade Sound Absorbing Qi Incantation* once while facing the sun. With mouth toward the sun, draw and swallow nine breaths. Recite the incantation again, close the eyes, and with a long nasal inhalation, silently count and swallow nine times. In each, visualize swallowing the sun’s nine-rayed purple radiance, descending into the cinnabar field in the form of the sun. The more repetitions before noon, the greater the merit; do not practice after noon.

Until the third night of the lunar month, at moonrise, follow the method for absorbing solar qi, swallowing ten times while visualizing ten rays of white light. After the twenty-third day, cease absorption.

Lunar qi is equal to solar qi, totaling ten thousand repetitions. Also visualize the moon’s form in the cinnabar field, merging with the sun to half its size.

In spring, first absorb the virtue of wood; in summer, fire; in autumn, metal; in winter, water; during the four seasons, when earth flourishes, absorb each in its proper color, totaling ten thousand repetitions.

Once every five days in a month, follow the *Cavern Scripture* method to absorb the purple qi from the Dipper ten thousand times, called the *"Outer Attendant Eightfold Jade Elixir."* After one thousand repetitions, divine light will appear and vanish at night. After two thousand repetitions, the entire body will radiate light.

After three thousand repetitions, the entire chamber will be filled with light. After four thousand repetitions, old illnesses, new ailments, scars, and blemishes will all vanish, and one’s complexion will revert to that of an infant. After five thousand repetitions, the Earth Bureau will erase one’s name from the register of the dead, and the Jade Clarity will inscribe one’s name in the ledger of the living, with a hundred spirits attending as guards. After six thousand repetitions, the entire body will radiate light, illuminating a hundred paces; at night, fine script may be read, ghosts and spirits will have no place to hide, and one will foreknow the yet-unmanifest. After seven thousand repetitions, one may blow life into all things and revive the dead. After eight thousand repetitions, by exhaling and reciting incantations over the five metals, they will transform into supreme treasures, their light forming perfect spheres. After nine thousand repetitions, the elixir will form like the sun, one’s face will take on a golden countenance, the bones will become refined and emit five fragrances, and the Three Heavens will record one as an immortal. After ten thousand repetitions, the Dao will be perfected, and one will attain the rank of Perfected.

*The Supreme Scripture of the Limitless Salvation of Humankind, Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure, Scroll Twenty-Four*

**Chapter on Exhaling and Absorbing the True Qi**

The Scripture states: Draw qi thirty-two times.
It further states: The Jade Tone gathers qi, the numinous wind collects mist; the Purple Void flourishes in splendor, aiding the ten thousand immortals.

The Perfected Master says: The true qi of the Numinous Treasure is the true Dao-qi of the thirty-two heavens. Without absorbing this qi, internal cultivation will lack the foundation for success, and external practice will yield no responsive signs. To wander the higher Dao as an empty corpse or recite sacred scriptures as a lower ghost is to labor in vain.

The Perfected Master says: By pacing the *Straddler, Harvester, Stomach, Hairy Head, Net, Turtle Beak, Triaster* constellations’ *gang* and absorbing the qi according to its color, the Heavenly Lords of the eight heavens will dispatch true immortals to attend and guard. One will be able to perceive all matters of the eight heavens with clarity and move without obstruction.

The Perfected Master says: First, knock the teeth nine times, then guide the qi from the Heavenly Gate into the Upper Primordial Net, flowing and extending to the corresponding lodging. Visualize each heaven as a palace of gold and jade, where the Heavenly Emperor sits enthroned, clad in robes matching the heaven’s color, exhaling the native qi like a dense, curling mist into the practitioner’s mouth. Follow the prescribed number for each, and for any petition, silently present it within the qi of the Emperor’s Mysterious Governance; the response will be immediate.

The *gang* of the Four Directions’ Brahman Heavens and the Central Dipper should be paced according to the day’s lodging, and practiced concurrently with the four heavens. (Diagram of the lodging configurations follows. Diagram omitted.)

The Scripture states: Within the true resides the spirit, the Great Lord of Longevity, the Peerless Duke, the Venerable White Prime, the Great One Controller of Destiny, and the Peach and Plum Union of Longevity.

The Perfected Master says: These two chapters contain the great Dao of the Supreme Cavern, the forbidden scriptures of the higher Dao, and the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*. The Great Lord of Longevity presides over the transformations of the ten thousand spirits. When a person is born, the Great Tenuity descends with qi to generate life, and the form first emerges from the womb. After birth, thirty-six thousand spirits are complete, and when one’s lifespan reaches thirty-six thousand days, the spirits return to the Great Tenuity—this is called a ghost. "Ghost" means "return." If one incurs transgressions in life, depleting qi and scattering spirits, thus bringing about one’s own death and decay, one will not fulfill the heavenly years but die prematurely in infancy, for the spirits are incomplete. When spirits are incomplete, the form is not whole. Moreover, even a minor transgression deducts one *suan*, and the Northern Dipper seizes three days’ worth of spirits. A grave evil shortens life by a year, and three hundred sixty spirits and their qi are detained. A minor good deed adds one *suan*, extending life by three days and augmenting the spirits. A great merit adds a year to one’s lifespan, extending life by three hundred sixty days and bestowing blessings. Thus, the increase and decrease occur. These seven spirits are the yin spirits of the Northern Dipper, also called the Mysterious Elixir Great One, and are part of the higher Dao’s forbidden canon. To know this Dao is to augment the spirits and extend life, enduring for ten thousand kalpas.

**Eulogy of the Venerable Prime of Longevity:**
In the Central Heaven stands the Dipper, master of souls and spirits,
The Mysterious Elixir Great One, the seven yin spirits.
Holding the numinous banner, they command the hundred spirits,
Bestowing or seizing, judging good and evil, shaping increase and decrease.
One *suan* removes three days from life,
One year, three hundred sixty stops.
Those who know how to move the seven numina
Ascend into the Mysterious Heaven and open the seven gates.

The three hun souls dance and unite as one form,
A hundred spirits rejoice and return in full array.
How to attain this Dao? From the Primordial Valley fire rises, and the seven spirits take flight.
Straight they enter the Dipper to open the Mysterious Pass,
Bow twice and knock upon the space between heaven and earth.
Return to the origin, expel evil and rebellion, erase the name of death,
Summon spirits to augment one’s allotted years and preserve life’s completion.
One may divide the body into billions,
Or reverse the bones to attain celestial immortality.
Silent within and without, all things forgotten,
The ape and horse die as yin returns to yang.
This Dao is secret and not rashly transmitted;
Guard it for a hundred kalpas and abide forever.
Inscribe your name in gold and present it to the Three Heavens—
Careless disclosure seals you forever in the river’s source.
Simply guard the heart to make stone firm;
In a hundred days, the spirits are whole and the root of life revives.

**The Flying Mysterious Purple Qi Chapter**
The Mysterious Master said: The root of the thirty-two heavens lies in the Primordial Record of the Western Tortoise Mountain. Within it is the *Cinnabar Yellow Flying Mysterious Purple Text*, the *Empty Cavern Numinous Scripture*. The Color Realm Demon King said: "I possess the Cavern Scripture—this is precisely that text."

The Flying Mysterious Purple Qi congeals the root of spirit,
Weaving the net of jade numina to govern the ten thousand spirits.
In the void it surges and coalesces naturally,
Above lie the towering twelve transmissions.
Jade towers soar, radiant with luminous clouds,
Flowing essence and purple palaces girded with golden chariots.
Jasper halls gleam, encircling the eight transcendent realms,
Within dwell the Nine Azure Gold Immortals.
The Cinnabar August Mother governs essence and extension,
Flying azure feathers and morning infants crowned.
Holding jade tablets and grasping numinous banners,
Five-colored life-demons face the imperial honored ones.
Grasping talismanic registers at the Gate of Life,
They chew the sun and moon, sip from the nectar springs.
The Net of Separation emits radiance to refine the five hun souls,
Internally replete and externally overflowing, the Crimson Palace rejoices.
Golden light shines brilliantly, the form perfectly round,
From the new moon it enters gold, its hue pure and unblemished.
Only the Enlightened One understands these words—
Five days and ten months, essence matches the origin.
Then one beholds the Flowery Canopy leading the immortal lords,
Purple qi swirls leftward, linked with the Dipper.
Passing through twenty-eight degrees, it enters the Golden Gate—
This is where the Cinnabar August One reviews the ten thousand immortals.
Those who clearly grasp this formula and add diligence,
Refining the form and contemplating the secret, must keep it distinct.
When wondrous visions respond and the essential text is obtained,
Guard it for three years to ensure long preservation.
After nine years, ascend the void in feathered skirts,
Phoenix robes lightly soaring to Mount Dragon.
Bowing and rising, the Nine Numinous Ones pay homage to the Jade Emperor.

**Method of Practice:**
In cultivating this Dao, calculate one year by twelve months. Each month, on the third, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days—five times monthly—
Observe purity rites and chant the Mysterious Text once.
After midnight, gaze upward toward the Golden Gate in the west, as if in the human realm.
If the sky is overcast and lightless, perform this within your chamber,
Silently reciting and inwardly contemplating as prescribed.
Visualize purple clouds arising from the left side of the Golden Gate,
Passing through the Winnowing Basket and Dipper, circling the Northern Dipper,
Then returning to the Golden Gate above—each detail must be vivid.
Upon completing the visualization, bow to the purple clouds four times and click the teeth thrice.
Raise your head and pray:
*"Heavenly qi is bright and clear, the hidden void reveals the true.
Flowing qi lingers, golden blossoms in four transcendent realms.
The Cinnabar August One spreads radiance, numinous flight on cloud chariots.
This night unfolds the array, the Azure Gold receives immortality.
Fulfill my supreme vow, the body responds to nature.
Bind life to the moon’s essence, preserve life at the sun’s root.
Three numina merge with the luminous, the luminous halts at Dragon Mountain.
In the secret night, pure and unveiled, I request as these words."*
After the prayer, draw purple qi through the nose and swallow it twenty-eight times, then cease.

Practice this for three years, and omens of divine immortals will descend to your chamber.
Your body will be enveloped in purple clouds and rosy mist, your name inscribed in the Nine Heavens.
After nine years, you will surely attain immortality.

The Mysterious Master said: Heaven possesses the qi of purple clouds, intersecting with the sun, moon, and five luminaries, and the divisions of the Northern Dipper. In every region and kingdom where this alignment occurs, there are those who attain the Dao and become immortal lords. Once understood, await the sign’s appearance—when you behold the purple clouds, perform the rites and prayers as described, not merely on ordinary days. With diligent intent, you will succeed in summoning the clouds, and ascension will follow.

Moreover, when purple clouds and yellow qi linger in mountain valleys like carpets or canopies—whether red, white, yellow, azure, purple, crimson, or golden, or five-colored clouds radiating brilliance with rosy mist on all sides—these are the Celestial Honored One and Supreme Emperor on their processions. Where they appear in mountain valleys, there dwell those who have attained the Dao. You should go there to cultivate and refine. If you glimpse the Celestial Honored One or Perfected Persons, swiftly burn incense, bow twice, and state your heart’s vow. With diligent practice, you will surely behold the imperial countenance and immediately achieve ascension. Seal this within your heart; do not lightly reveal it to others. If the Dao is divulged, its numen scatters, and immortality cannot be attained. Follow the example of Master Yin of Wen Shi, who served the Sage Lord of the Golden Portal as his standard. You should be cautious and strive to practice.

**The Three Ones’ Mysterious Subtleties Chapter**
The Lord of the Nine Empyreans said: The Three Ones are the pivot of creation and transformation. They are not exclusive to the supreme elixir but are also inherently present and complete within the human body. If one can cultivate the Three Ones within the body, then mother and child will not separate, spirit and qi will naturally guard each other, harmonious and warm, radiant and luminous.

Have you not seen the full moon at midday? When the wind is still, no clouds stir, not even the finest gauze moves, and the azure sky is limpid and clear—how could there be any obstruction? The same is true for humans. If one can harmonize the Three Ones, then myriad thoughts will not arise, merging with the qi of the azure sky. Internally and externally luminous, one becomes one with the void and may ascend.

Some in the world may have furtively heard of this Dao, mistaking it for qi ingestion—puffing the cheeks to forcefully swallow through the nose and mouth. This can lead to sudden death, much like mistakenly taking poison in medicine, an irredeemable error. The Three Ones within the body are no different from the supreme elixir; the secret formula must not be lightly transmitted.

The Mysterious Master said: The Supreme One, the Emperor Lord of the Nine Heavens, is named *Xuantian* and styled *Sanyuan*.

One is styled *Bowushang*, another *Boshihua*, wielding the Tiger Talisman of the Divine, sealed within a blue jade casket. To the right stands the Imperial Minister, named *Zhao Qinjing*, styled *Zhong Xuansheng*. One is called *Qifei*, another *Changfu*. Within the *Great Cavern Sutra*’s purple jade casket, he commands twelve thousand celestial immortals and their steeds. Their foremost leader stands nine inches and nine fen tall, clad in a purple brocade robe embroidered with gold, crowned with a dark-jeweled coronet, seated upon a seven-jeweled throne. At times, he rides a nine-dragon chariot, roaming the Three Realms, bearing the Heavenly Treasure Brazier in hand to govern and transform the Jade Clarity. The Supreme *Xuan* Venerable has two great ministers, together forming a triad. The left minister is titled *Xuan Yi Dao Lord*, his head clad in azure, his robes azure. The right minister is titled *Taihe Old Master*, his head clad in white, his robes white. These two spirits are the hun and po of the Dao.

The Supreme One Emperor Lord resides in the *Niwan* Palace of the brain. There is a solar emblem, round and nine inches across, its crimson light and purple rays surging ten thousand *zhang* into the sky. Above it hangs the Dipper, its handle pointing forward, resembling an infant clad in red brocade. The incantation reads:

*Interflowing divine qi, spirit nourishing marrow.*
*Absorb my radiant essence, divine qi fills and fulfills,*
*Body glowing with luminous freshness.*

**Upper Prime Perfected One Talisman**

The Mysterious Master said: The Middle Prime Emperor One True Youth is named *Shenyunzhu*, styled *Zinan Dan*. One is called *Shengshang Bo*, another *Shiyunju*. He holds the Fire Star Talisman, sealed within a jade casket. To his right stands the Assistant Minister, named *Zhong Guangjian*, styled *Sihua Ling*. One is called *Youche Bo*, another *Chong Shihua*. He bears the Bright Moon Pearl, commanding ten thousand divine immortals and their steeds. Their foremost leader stands six inches and six fen tall, clad in a cinnabar brocade robe, crowned with a nine-phoenix coronet, seated upon a seven-jeweled throne. At times, he rides a nine-unicorn chariot, roaming the Ten Directions, bearing a golden brazier in hand to govern and transform. The Supreme Clarity Middle One Prime Venerable has two great ministers. The left is titled *Perfected One*, the right *Guangjian*, entering the *Jiowei* three inches within the body. The heart is like a lotus, within which lies a solar emblem, its crimson flames surging into the sky. The Emperor Lord is clad in a cinnabar brocade robe, seated within the solar emblem. The prayer reads:

*Scatter radiance, Red Child,*
*Return the hun, restore the po,*
*Revert the old to infant youth,*
*Cross life’s threshold, turn back years,*
*Preserve life without end.*

**Middle Prime Perfected One Talisman**

The Mysterious Master said: The Lower Prime Emperor One Primordial King is named *Shiming Jing*, styled *Guxia Xuan*. One is called *Infant Womb*, another *Bo Shiyuan*. He holds the *Golden Star Great Possession Sutra*, sealed within a yellow jade casket. To his right stands the Assistant Minister Perfected One, named *Guishang Ming*, styled *Guxia Xuan*. One is called *Fengshen Bo*, another *Chengguang Sheng*. He bears the Bright Moon Pearl, commanding eleven thousand earthly immortals and their steeds. Their foremost leader stands five inches and five fen tall, clad in a yellow brocade robe, crowned with a nine-dragon *Yuanyou* coronet, seated upon a seven-jeweled throne. At times, he rides a five-colored lion chariot, patrolling the Five Peaks, bearing a fragrant treasure brazier in hand to govern and transform. The Grand Clarity Lower One Prime King has two great ministers: to the left, *You Jing*; to the right, the Imperial Minister. They enter the three inches below the navel, the Lower Cinnabar Field. There is a lunar emblem, golden in hue, filling the Cinnabar Field. The Primordial King is clad in a yellow brocade robe, resembling an infant, seated within the lunar emblem. From his mouth issues the chant:

*Jade stem, white pearl fluid,*
*Congeals to form the White Spirit.*
*Nurture the form with the Five Elders’ talisman,*
*Extract the register from the Emperor One’s chariot.*
*The Gate of Life must not tilt,*
*The golden fluid must not err.*
*Return the essence, fill the White to repletion,*
*Let not the Jade Spring leak.*
*Life and death both arise therefrom—*
*Seal it, and become a divine immortal.*

The prayer reads:

*Purge the filth and turbidity, cast out the old, absorb the new.*
*Engender my Five Elders, the Emperor Perfected transforms the form.*
*Transform the bones and marrow, the intestines become sinews.*
*Golden bones, jade marrow, accord with the Dao, accord with the Perfected.*
*Spontaneous transformation, longevity without end.*
*Forever with the Three Treasures, together preserve the root of life.*

**Lower Prime Perfected One Talisman**

From midnight to the *si* hour, visualize the Upper Prime Perfected One. From noon to the *you* hour, visualize the Middle Prime. From dusk to midnight, visualize the Lower Prime. With prolonged visualization, the Perfected Ones will manifest in form, converse with you, traverse stars and cross moons, review memorials and petitions, and teach you the arts of penetrating the mysterious. As for the Three Ones’ supreme Dao: one must not harbor anger or indulge in lust. Anger causes the Three Ones to depart and vanish; lust prevents the work from succeeding. One must not hold newborn infants, for their residual impure qi has not yet dissipated, and contact would offend the Dao of the Three Ones. Whether moving, staying, sitting, or reclining, one should constantly visualize them.

**The Three Ones’ Mysterious and Subtle Essentials**

The Mysterious Master said: To attain the wonders of the mysterious and subtle, one must practice in stillness. On the spring equinox, at midnight during the *zi* hour, rise and face east, close the eyes, and visualize the Three Ones’ ministers within your body, along with the seven who accompany you—yourself at the center—all riding the purple cloud’s mist to ascend the *Yangming* of the Northern Dipper, the eastern spirit of the Dipper. Then visualize entering the star’s center and sitting there, swallowing purple qi thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will naturally perceive the *Yangming Dongyuan Taishang* Palace, wherein resides the *Qingxuan* Youth, who bestows upon you the true qi. First, visualize the purple qi beneath the Northern Dipper, as thick as a bowstring, descending straight before you from the star. Then visualize the Three Ones’ *Zhoujun* oral instructions, the seven persons among the Dipper’s seven stars, together ascending the *Yangming*’s grand procession. The central star of the Dipper covers your head with the *Kui* and points the handle forward. Swallow the purple qi thirty times, visualizing yourself ingesting it. Also imagine the Three Ones’ ministers swallowing it simultaneously. After swallowing, further visualize the seven persons following the purple qi’s descent from the palace back to your own palace. After a long while, recite the prayer:

*Three Venerables, Supreme Perfected,*
*Great Mysterious Lofty Spirits.*

The *Yangming* governs spring, and the ten thousand youths begin their procession. The *Danyuan* governs summer, where vermilion and purple merge in mist. The *Yinjing* governs autumn, and the Celestial Might arrays six formations. The *Beiji* governs winter, where the ten thousand evils and treacheries are blocked. The Five Lands hold the *ren*, *wu*, and *ji* as the Celestial Gates. All that they strike is destroyed; none dare oppose their advance. They refine my seven *po*, harmonize my three *hun*, generate my five viscera, and cause my Yang Perfected to flourish. Ascending to fly in the *Shangqing*, I drift upon the radiance of the Seven Origins. Abiding in eternal life, I command the thousand spirits with a whistle. You too may rest, visualizing this across the four seasons, reciting this single incantation.

*The Supreme Treasure Chapter of the Great Ultimate*
The *Supreme Treasure Chapter* was transmitted by the Most High to the Supreme Thearch, the Supreme Thearch to the Celestial Thearch, the Celestial Thearch to the Thearch of the *Taiwei* Heaven, the Thearch of the *Taiwei* Heaven to the Thearch of the Golden Portals, and the Thearch of the Golden Portals to the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea, who sealed it to govern the famous mountains and summon and command the Five Peaks. Inscribe it in vermilion upon white silk and wear it upon the left elbow; do not treat it with carelessness or defilement. After wearing it for eight years, the Three Ones will all appear.

On the first day of the first lunar month, inscribe a talisman in blue-green ink, face north, bow twice, and swallow it. After the Three Ones appear together, use gold as the material, nine inches in length, four inches in width, and six *fen* in thickness; carve and inscribe it to seal the malevolent spirits of mountains and rivers and to command the true essences of the Five Peaks.

When the Three Primordial Lords of the Three Origins arrive, you must comprehend the proper application and moderation—this is the Dao of the divine and the true. To ingest the talisman, face north, click the teeth thirty-six times, then raise your head and recite the incantation:

*"Three Perfected guard the chamber,
Primordial Elders secure the essence.
Heaven and Earth merge as one,
Three qi intermingle.
The August Lord wields his authority,
His command seals the spirits.
Summon the mountains, call forth the seas,
Crush and annihilate the myriad spirits.
Hasten to invoke the Northern Emperor,
Array the names of demons.
Bind and govern all without exception,
Swiftly return to the ghostly camp."*

Recite again:
*"Supreme Ultimate August Lord,
Three Primordial True Ones.
Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea,
Deliver and reveal to the beholder.
Wear, ingest, and swallow,
Penetratingly perceive ghosts and spirits.
Mountains, rivers, and the Five Peaks,
All submit to my command.
Wear it forever,
The Cavernous Chapter soars through the Dipper."*

*The True Talisman of the Three Ones of the Supreme Treasure Chapter*
With the left hand’s middle finger pressed into the palm and the thumb pressing the *zi* mark, wear the talisman on the right to seal mountains and summon seas, to govern the myriad spirits, to command birds and beasts, to subjugate celestial soldiers, and to traverse the Five Peaks. At such times, first click the teeth thirty-six times, visualize the Seven Stars covering your head, and exhale red *qi* to crown a city, surrounding it on all sides, burning within and without until nothing remains. See yourself standing at the center of the fire, and in an instant, the divine officials of the Five Peaks and the beasts of the mountains and wilds will come to pay homage. Then recite the incantation:

*"The Primordial Beginning issues the decree,
Proclaiming to the myriad spirits.
The Heavenly Perfected August Lord
Is born with the qi.
From below, all are governed,
All return to the Supreme Clarity.
Should any fail to comply,
Their true forms shall be seized.
Seal the mountains, summon the seas,
Respond to the command and collapse.
Hasten to submit,
Linger not in delay.
Swift as the true law,
Do not transgress the dark realms."*

Afterward, swallow the *qi* thirty-six times and await the decree.

*Edict of the Three Ones and the Primordial Spirit*
Three bodies as one are my transformations; the Three Ones are the gods of the original unity, each born of my own primordial spirit. If one body is not true, the other two are false. If the True One is not truly visualized, my two other spirits are also false and unreal. The Three Ones and the Primordial King need not be visualized, for they are natural transformations inherent in every person. If the visualization is not true, it becomes the "horse of thought." With a single thought, transformations occur in an instant. As the scripture says: "Each time you visualize, a spirit departs; unknowingly, each day diminishes." This is the meaning.

For those cultivating the Dao of Celestial Immortality and practicing the Orthodox Rites of the Jade Clarity, on the days of the Six *Jia* and Six *Ding*, calm the mind, stabilize the spirit, enter seclusion at the four hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*, burn incense, and inscribe the talisman of the day in vermilion. Visualize the divine generals and jade maidens of the day, face north, and swallow it. Settle the thoughts, sit upright, close the eyes, clench the fists, and envision the five true *qi* of the Five Directions—radiant and yang—descending from the Great Void, directly entering your body through the *Niwan* Palace, swirling nine times, then entering the Crimson Palace to merge with the Imperial Abode. Next, descend into the Kunlun (the navel), where your Three Ones and the three *qi*—blue-green, yellow, and white—of the true spirits blend into one. In an instant, they naturally ascend and descend. After a year of practice, the three *qi* and the myriad spirits will appear, and your body will respond to transformations, reaching everywhere.

Then step the *Gang* of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, invite the *qi* of the Thirty-Two Heavens into the Cinnabar Field, and coalesce the Thirty-Two Jade Characters, ascending to the *Niwan* Palace and the various heavens to transform into the myriad spirits. You may then use the *Chapter for Governing and Summoning the Myriad Spirits* to issue decrees to the Three Realms, and with the *Chapter of the Three Mysterious Qi in Flight*, submit memorials to the Heavenly Ministries. Through the ritual of memorials and prostrations, divine transformations will swiftly manifest, and nothing will be denied.

For those cultivating the Dao of Celestial Immortality and practicing the Orthodox Rites of the Jade Clarity, on the birthday corresponding to your life’s fate, sit upright, regulate the breath evenly, close the mouth, exhale, and with the heart-spirit guide the *qi* to the root, reaching the life’s origin. Inhale to the stem, ascend along the spine to the *Niwan* Palace, and maintain continuity. If the visualization is not diligent, wait until the breath is even and settled, allowing it to move naturally. After three days, the light will whiten the eyebrows. After seven days, the spirit will congeal, and you will become serene. After ten days, the spirit will attain flight, suddenly appearing before you, and you will hear the sounds of immortals—wind and rain—in your ears. Knock on the Mysterious Pass to open the Three Palaces; over time, the Three Fields will gestate treasures, and you may refine the divine elixir.

For those cultivating the Dao of Celestial Immortality and practicing the Orthodox Rites of the Jade Clarity, on the day of the Primordial Spirit, at the four hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*, gaze at yourself in a large mirror, close your mouth, and visualize without error. On the *jiazi* day at the *zi* hour, face south, click the teeth, and beat the Heavenly Drum, each thirty-six times. Fold your hands, sit upright, regulate the breath evenly, and as before, visualize your body entering the Lower Cinnabar Field within the white *qi*, about one *cun* and two *fen*, like an infant. Gradually ascend to the spleen, pass through the Florid Canopy, cross the Double Towers, traverse the two Golden Chambers, enter the *Niwan* Palace, and stand atop the crown. Visualize purple *qi* and yellow mist swirling and covering you. Then slowly step forward to stand before your face, envisioning yourself as a one- or two-year-old child, as if your own child—do not glance at other matters, lest your focus be seized by external phenomena. Then visualize yourself soaring upward, entering through the *Niwan* Palace and the crown, descending through the two chambers, crossing the Double Towers, and returning to the Cinnabar Field—this completes one cycle. In daily practice, whether moving or still, guide the *qi* with the spirit, visualize the Three Ones and the True Lords, and after a month, practice at the *zi* and *wu* hours. After a month, gradually visualize the spirit growing to match your body’s size, coming and going, walking, and conversing with others.

Begin by holding the breath as if dwelling within the womb, which will hasten the attainment of efficacy. After one hundred days, visualize yourself ascending in feathered robes to pay homage to the Primordial. For those who cultivate the Dao of celestial immortality, the form and *qi* become inwardly complete, moving in and out without obstruction. In a single thought, one may ascend to the Great Void or wander among the Five Peaks, all without hindrance. In all such ascents and petitions to the Three Clarities, the Nine Heavens, and the celestial realms of the myriad heavens, summon the true immortal officials, the *ding*-*jia* generals, jade maidens, golden youths, and functionary messengers recorded in the received registers of the method—along with the three *qi* and the true spirits within the body. In profound stillness, they merge with the Void, ascending to the Nine Heavens, where spirit unites with the Dao and *qi* transforms into the True.

On days of practice, inscribe the vermilion talisman and swallow it. Then invoke and visualize the spirits, calming the mind and stilling thoughts until form and *qi* fully harmonize. The host of spirits and the three officials of the body’s true spirits merge in wondrous transformation. The heart unites with the Great Void, and the myriad spirits fill the body. In a single thought, all becomes luminously clear, and one ascends to pay homage. The Three Realms respond at will, and all petitions are answered without fail.

First swallow the talisman, then summon the spirits in accordance with its decree. Visualize the Supreme Ministers, the Grand Chancellors, the Supreme Assistants, the Supreme Protectors, the True Lords, the Immortal Lords, the Marquises, and the Ministers—all wearing *longjin* hats, sable caps, crimson robes, and jade pendants. Next, visualize the true officials and immortal officials bowing and rising, wearing caps, azure robes, jade tablets, and shoes. Then summon the six *jia* and six *ding* great generals, clad in golden armor and helmets, bearing brocade banners. Next, summon the six *ding* and six *jia* jade maidens, adorned in phoenix crowns and feathered robes, holding mirrors. Then summon the six *jia* and six *ding* golden youths, dressed in blue-green garments with double topknots, bearing texts. Next, summon the divine messengers of the *yunshen huidao* functionaries, wearing dark caps and crimson robes, holding texts. Finally, summon the divine messengers of the *yunshen feixuan* functionaries, donning black headscarves with sashes and forehead bands in blue-green, yellow, and red, dressed in brocade robes and carrying fish-tail blades. Each of the above comprises twelve persons.

Then calm the mind, still all thoughts, harmonize the breath, and extinguish distractions until profound stillness is achieved. Thereafter, summon the myriad spirits to enter from the lower Cinnabar Field, merging with one’s own spirit; proceed to the middle Cinnabar Field to merge with the Cinnabar True; and ascend to the upper Cinnabar Field to merge with the Emperor Lord—all in accordance with the method within the three *qi*. The Supreme Ministers and immortal officials emerge from the Upper Prime, standing in attendance in the upper region. From the left and right, the generals of the blue-green *qi*, the jade maidens, and the golden youths emerge from the Middle Prime, standing in the middle region, while the functionary messengers of the yellow *qi* emerge from the Lower Prime, standing in the lower region. From the left and right of the white *qi*, one’s own spirit emerges from the Purple Gate, forgetting form and merging with the Great Void. Then, with a single thought, ascend to pay homage to the Three Realms at will, or wander among the Five Peaks, making prayers and declarations without obstruction. All petitions are answered, spirits are set in motion, and the Dao is joined—submitting secret memorials with the *Nine Numinous Flying Steps*.

*The Great Method of the Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation, Scroll Twenty-Five*
*Chapter on the Inner Homage to the Three Luminaries*

The Mysterious Master said: Those who cultivate the great method but have not yet fully comprehended the majestic transformations of the celestial perfected may be assailed by demonic trials, causing the spirits and deities to show no reverence, and their summons to go unanswered. They should practice the method of inner homage to the Three Luminaries and the Dao of flying immortals with divided forms.

During the *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei* hours, pay homage to the Central Prime Controller of Destiny within the heart, whose name is *Xuanjian*, the Great Lord of the Central Ultimate. Below, he resides in the spleen, which is the Jade Hall Palace—also called the Jade Chamber—where the Lord of the Great One reposes, governing the nourishment of the body’s form and substance. During these four hours, knock the teeth five times, and visualize the spleen filled with yellow *qi*, within which a true person appears, like a newborn infant, clad in yellow robes and cap. Call out: *"Central Ultimate Xuanjian, Great Lord of the Great One, I seek the Dao of the True Person, the immortals, and the Yellow Court."* Repeat this five times, then lie down, close the eyes, and meditate for fifty breaths.

This Central Controller of Destiny is the Venerable Lord who transforms into the Emperor Lord of the Great One, the father of the gods born in the Nine Heavens, who governs the Palace of the Great Ultimate. Those who know him will not enter hell; jade youths and maidens attend him, and the myriad spirits serve at his command.

During the *yin*, *mao*, *wu*, and *shen* hours, pay homage to the Upper Prime Spirit Lord of the Great One, known as the Old Man of the Southern Ultimate, who resides in the Palace of the Great One, governing the body’s ethereal and corporeal souls, the womb spirits, the life *qi*, and the father of the fetal palace. During these four hours, knock the teeth nine times, and visualize a space one *cun* directly above the head, called the Palace of the Great Ultimate—also known as the Palace of the Great One—filled with red and yellow *qi*. Within the *qi* appears a true person, like a child, dressed in crimson robes. Call out: *"Southern Ultimate Yuanlao, Spirit Lord of the Great One, I seek the Dao of the divine elixir, long life, and immortality."* Repeat this nine times, then lie down, close the eyes, and meditate for ninety breaths. Those who cultivate this will prolong their years without dying, attain the transformations of immortals, dispel demonic trials, and summon true immortals.

During the *zi*, *you*, *si*, and *hai* hours, pay homage to the Lower Prime Mysterious Dao Mother, who resides in the Double Union Palace—the kidneys, which correspond to the Southern Ultimate above, hence called the Northern Ultimate. She governs the body’s essence and *qi*, and is the mother of the registers of life and death. During these four hours, knock the teeth four times, and visualize white *qi* between the kidneys, within which a divine tortoise appears, bearing a mysterious woman in blue-white robes, like a newborn girl. To her left stands the Controller of Records, a celestial official in white robes; to her right, the Controller of Destiny, a celestial official in blue-green robes. Call out: *"Lower Prime Yuan Shen, Northern Ultimate Mysterious Dao Mother, named Xuanmiao, I seek the golden liquor and jade nectar for sustenance. I beseech you to command the Controllers of Records and Destiny to erase my name from the register of death and inscribe it in the register of long life, and to dispatch the six *ding* jade maidens to prepare the traveling kitchen."* Repeat this four times, then lie down, close the eyes, and meditate for forty breaths.

Daily practice must not be neglected, for over months and years, its responsive efficacy knows no bounds. After nine years, one may ascend as a Grand Supreme Immortal Minister; even within a single year, faint traces of attainment appear, and spirits and gods are summoned at will, with every desire answered without fail. Maintain a steadfast heart, guard against recklessness, and be especially mindful of speech—thus may one attain immortality in due time. This is the practice of the Three Sovereign Lords of the Cavernous Mystery, the esoteric mechanism of the *Lingbao* tradition, to be performed only after pledging before heaven and informing one’s master.

**Lingbao Silent Audience: Refining the Crown Chapter**
At the three hours of *yin*, *wu*, and *xu* each day, enter the oratory, form the Jade Clarity mudra with both hands, and visualize oneself as a transcendent crane in the method of the White Crane Immortal. Envision the Gate of Heaven opening, from which a white crane descends. Next, visualize riding the white crane, soaring effortlessly to the summit of the Three Heavens, where the Primordial Beginning’s crown emits nine-colored golden light, pouring into one’s own crown. Imagine one’s body, with its myriad apertures, radiating light that illuminates the ten directions of the cosmos. Upon completion, remount the white crane and return to one’s original abode. Thus does one receive the Lingbao’s most arcane and profound oral instructions from the Primordial Beginning. For petitions or supplications, prostrate upon the jade steps and present the memorial in the same manner as above.

Before visualization, first refine the crown with the mudra to open the Gate of Heaven, then perform the divine transformation incantation:
*"Jin zha! Jin zha! Great Power’s Crown-Refining Mudra—left hand."*
This is the oral instruction personally transmitted by the Primordial Beginning to the Wondrous Practitioner of Realized Conduct and the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign for their ascension. It must not be lightly disclosed.

The Sovereign said: The *Lingbao* Dao is most luminous and easily understood, most essential and perfectly fitting. When transmitted to the right person for reception and upholding, how could one not command the reverence of the myriad spirits and expect imminent ascension?

**Receiving and Wielding the Staff Chapter**
The Sovereign said: The *Lingbao* Dao possesses a divine staff of spiritual potency, by which the gods of the Six Heavens are awed and the myriad spirits of the Three Realms are commanded. At a propitious day, within the oratory of a sacred mountain’s grotto-heaven, blessed site, or numinous altar, gather a single stalk of sweet bamboo, six feet in length, with twelve nodes. On the third node from the top, carve a bend on each side; in the hollow of the curve above, inscribe the sun and moon, and below, the Dipper’s form. Bore a cavity at the crown and insert the Central Guardian’s talisman. Below the second node, bore four cavities and insert the Four Directions’ Guardian talismans. Seal with wax and mark the four directions.

Below the third node, carve the *Ten Directions Lingbao Eternal Transformation Heavenly Worthy*. Beginning on the first day, follow the ten cyclical days, recite the incantation, and draw the *qi* of the five directions. Face each direction in turn, recite the incantation, and blow the *qi* upon the staff. Each night, engage in visualization; after a full year, when the *qi* is sufficient, the staff may be employed.

**Method of Use:**
Knock the teeth thirty-six times, and visualize the Five Emperors’ Direct Attendants, one for each direction, each accompanied by five-colored light flowing and shimmering upon the staff. Envision the Five Emperors’ Jade Maidens, one for each, standing in attendance to the staff’s left and right. Recite the incantation:
*"Mountain of the Great Yang, primordial essence of the Primordial Beginning.
Opening heaven and unfurling earth, sweet bamboo channels the numinous.
Direct Attendants and Guardian Clerks, marshaling divine soldiers.
Five colors flow and shimmer, crimson robes and golden tassels.
Assisting the Perfected Ascended, emerging from darkness and entering the unseen.
Summoning the heavens, the heavens bow; subduing the earth, the earth welcomes.
Pointing at ghosts, ghosts perish; demons and malevolent spirits are bound in form.
Divine talisman and numinous staff, awe and command the hundred directions.
With me they are perfected, with me they are born.
After ten thousand kalpas, they replace my form.
Governed by the Five Liberations, the spirit ascends to the Upper Clarity.
By the talisman’s decree and command, none dare disobey."*

Upon completing the incantation, draw the *qi* of the five directions and swallow thirty-six times. Point the staff toward heaven, and the celestial gods will render homage. Point it toward earth, and the terrestrial gods will receive and welcome. Point it toward the northeast, and the myriad ghosts will be bound in form. Point it to shatter hell, and the deceased souls will return to life. Point it at calamities and misfortunes, and they will collapse at the gesture. The Way of the Five Liberations consists of the true *qi* of the Five Phases, seizing the balance of the Northern Dipper, escaping the fetters of death, achieving liberation through the corpse, and ascending as a spirit to the Upper Clarity.

**Eastern Guardian’s Talisman**
Nine figures for the East, inscribed in blue with black above.

**Southern Guardian’s Talisman**
Three figures for the South, inscribed in cinnabar with blue above.

**Western Guardian’s Talisman**
Seven figures for the West, inscribed in white with yellow above.

**Northern Guardian’s Talisman**
Five figures for the North, inscribed in black with white above.

**Central Guardian’s Talisman**
Twelve figures for the Center, inscribed in yellow with red above.

**Chapter on Concealing Traces and the Five Liberations**
The Mysterious Master said: At Moonwave Stream on Mount Green City, at Dragon Gate, one encounters the Venerable One and together pays homage to the Perfected. The Master secretly transmits the Five Methods of Liberation, which must not be lightly disclosed nor recklessly imparted to those who are impious or unprincipled. If the spirit conceals and vanishes, shedding the mortal to transcend the mundane, none shall perceive its form—this is called the method of concealment.

The Five Liberations correspond to Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. They are the means to receive the *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, to grasp the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s transformations, and to steal the rhythm of yin and yang’s *qi*, practicing them frequently in daily use. For those who seek the Great Dao yet remain bound by life and death, when encountering the calamities of one’s destined epoch, when baleful stars descend, or when demonic tribulations assail the true and unwitting, to escape the appointed hour of death and rebirth, one must skillfully employ this method—its numinous efficacy defies description.

**Metal Liberation**
On a *gengzi* day, take an ancient ingot or halberd weighing twelve taels and forge it into a ruler one *chi* in length. In a purified chamber, purify the body. At the first watch of the night, place the ruler on the ground one *zhang* and two *chi* before the bed. Wait until the *zi* hour, first cleansing oneself, then drink a cup of frankincense and borneol water. Strike the teeth twenty-four times, visualize the ruler as one’s own form, and ensure no sound reaches one’s ears. Silently recite the sacred incantation seven times. Once done, place the ruler beneath a felt mat, allowing no one to see it. Perform this visualization for forty-nine days. Upon completion, when ready to use it, tie a white silk thread to the ruler and swiftly cast it down before fleeing without looking back. While reciting the incantation, also spray borneol and frankincense water onto the ruler. Recite the incantation and draw seven mouthfuls of *qi* from the auspicious direction onto the ruler. The subsequent four methods follow this pattern.

The incantation states:

The Three Terraces give birth to me and transmit the Dharma,
The Three Terraces protect me and ascend as immortals.
Communicating past karma, the ruler severs responses,
Restoring my original form to its fundamental essence.
Swiftly, swiftly, as □□□□□□□ decrees.

**Wood Release**
On a *jiazi* day, take a branch from a fallen red pear tree, as long as oneself. On the day of use, cleanse the body and proceed as in the method above. Complete forty-nine days. At the time of use, place it on the ground without looking back, gaze upward at the sun and depart, never glancing at the form.

The incantation states:
Branch-wave-draw, crow-fish-wave-draw, *ka*□-wave-draw,
Three Terraces birth-body-draw.
On this day, the birth-body crosses the Dao,
Forty-nine merits ascend.
A thousand transformations, ten thousand changes, the body conceals,
The Upper Clarity staff transforms my form.
Swiftly, swiftly, as □□□□□□□ star decrees.

**Water Release**
On a *renzi* day, take a large tortoise shell weighing one *jin*. Perform the method for forty-nine days. On the day of use, if encountering great water, or upon a bridge or boat, release the tortoise into the water without looking back.

The incantation states:
Spirit-shell disperses *qi*, enters my staff.
I possess the great Dao, unlike the vulgar.
Emerging with the sun, entering with the moon,
Driving tigers, pursuing dragons.
Depart and transform in my stead,
Spring veins interconnect.
Swiftly, swiftly, as □□□□□□□ star decrees.

**Fire Release**

**Fire Release**
On a *bingzi* night, take one male sparrow and place it in a small cage. The method is the same as before. Feed it only at your side, and when ready, sprinkle water upon it, draw in *qi*, and blow *qi* as in the previous method for a full forty-nine days. Hold the sparrow in your hand when ready to use it. Tie a crimson thread around its head, and when the sparrow dies, place it in your bosom. Upon encountering a great fire, cast the sparrow into the flames and depart without looking back.

The incantation states:
Crimson Sparrow stands before me,
I grasp the power of creation.
The Three Terraces guard my life,
The Five Emperors preserve my birth.
The *Zhibo* bird’s divine fire transforms immortals,
Commanding my nature and spirit to be whole.
Swiftly, swiftly, as □□□□□□□ decrees.

**Earth Release**
On a *wuzi* day, take one of your own shoes and perform the method as before for a full forty-nine days. When ready to use it, tie a yellow thread to the shoe and cast it to the ground without looking back.

The incantation states:
Primordial Yellow Dragon,
Flourishing in the four seasons.
Central Palace holds true position,
Wielding authority at the source.
Judging the Earth Bureau,
I heed the Emperor’s decree.
You now stand in my stead,
Assuming my borrowed power.
Eighteen counts mark the *wu* and *ji* cycle.
Swiftly, swiftly, as □□□□□□□ decrees.

**The Divine Gaze: Ranks of the Many Heavens**
The Mystic Master said: If you wish to behold the Thirty-Two Heavens, first cultivate all practices, then make a great vow and employ all your heart. Next, enter stillness through visualization, and only then may you attain the vision.

First, begin with a scattered mind, then make your vow: Today I observe the Heavenly Emperors. May the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, all sentient beings bound in dullness, the four births and six paths, and those whose names are inscribed in the heavens—may their souls ascend with mine to the Emperor’s abode. May the suffering souls of Fengdu, those long sunk in kalpas of darkness, and my countless ancestors all transcend obscurity, escape the wheel of suffering, and ascend with my soul to the sacred fruit. May they be far from the Five Turbidities, roam the Dao’s realm, and may all living beings across the ten thousand lands dissolve their evil karma, lift their manifold sins, and depart from all suffering and affliction. May they attain the Dharma-body, complete with the ten marks, and ever wander the heavens, expounding the Dharma to awaken the deluded, continuing the sacred lineage, and mastering the ten holy paths.

Though my fleshly body bears form and trace,
My spirit ascends the Three Heavens,
To attend the Primordial Lord of the Ancestral Masters,
Receive the Great Law of the Numinous Treasure,
And wander the many heavens for ten thousand kalpas.
In this life and the next, may I ever dwell in blessed realms,
With the seven treasures complete,
Gardens, mansions, palaces,
Wives, servants, children,
And all friends—may they join me in contemplation.
May I bestow upon the Ten Directions and Three Realms
Elephants, horses, rare treasures,
Chariots, garments, food, bedding,
Ever giving without stint.
May I dam rivers to build bridges,
Sink wells by the roadside,
Aid all travelers,
Rescue the hungry and thirsty,
Bury the carcasses of the six livestock and flying birds,
Ensuring none are exposed to the Three Luminaries.
Make vows, cultivate good deeds.

Once settled in visualization without slackening,
Enter stillness, then burn fine incense.
First behold the azure clouds’ path,
Spiraling upward in twisting ascent,
Rising layer upon layer to the celestial realm.
Next, observe the Heavenly Emperor’s abode.
Visualize the heavens’ vast and majestic splendor,
Ever fragrant with *qi*, free of impurity.
The Heavenly Emperor rides an eightfold jade carriage,
Triple-pure flying clouds,
Jade wheels and feathered canopies,
Five-colored floral radiance,
Dragons, unicorns, tigers, leopards,
Lions, white cranes,
Their songs and calls harmonious.
The ground is paved with gold,
The four-sided stairways of white jade,
Adorned with the seven treasures and luminous pearls,
Glowing with resplendent light.
The Emperor wears a *liluo* robe,
A crown of a hundred treasures,
Attended on all sides by flying immortals,
Their bodies radiant, outshining sun and moon.
Their music—drums, strings, songs, and flutes—
All resound in unison.
The people thrive, none die young,
No cries of lament are heard.
In those heavenly palaces,
Even the sword trees stand unmoving.
Behold the countless heavenly hosts,
With natural food and drink,
Abundant in kind and flavor,
Their essence flowing down to the lower realms.
The heavens possess treasure trees and golden pools,
Five-colored radiance,
Purple groves where gentle winds
Brush the branches, producing wondrous sounds.
Those heavenly palaces,
Forged from myriad treasures,
House the Emperor in solemn majesty.
Their light illumines the Nine Darks,
As the Emperor, with the most excellent Dharma,
Universally delivers the heavenly beings.
Hearing the Dharma, they praise its virtue.
Upon the Emperor’s jade table,
Red-script jade characters summon the assembled immortals.
Yellow talismanic writs bring joy to the dark realms.

Each day, visualize your form
Clad in ritual robes and feathered garments,
Riding clouds of nine hues,
Approaching the center of a heaven,
Following the celestial palaces within,
Joining the ranks to pay homage before withdrawing.
On the Three Primes and Eight Festivals,
Ascend with the ranks to the many heavens,
Partake in the Dharma assemblies,
Seated upon the Jeweled Blade Terrace.
The terrace is round like an altar,
Layer upon countless layer.
Gaze upward as the Lord of Heaven expounds the Dharma.

With long and devoted practice,
In deep concentration, the eyes attain vision,
And in dreams, when form is forgotten,
The spirit soars to the Dao’s realm.
The eyes behold the Heavenly Emperor expounding the Dharma,
The ears hear the Emperor’s sacred words,
And the music of celestial flutes and reed pipes.
At this time, the yang spirit is formed,
Able to ascend the many heavens.
Only then may you behold the Three Heavens.

When practicing the divine gaze of the heavens,
First purify yourself with fasting and ablutions.
Chant the Heavenly Cavern’s natural numinous hymns,
First three hundred times,
Then seven hundred,
Completing one thousand,
Only then may you proceed.
A single thought sends the spirit flying ten thousand *li*,
A single intention invokes mysterious responses in the Ten Directions.
After a year,
The yang spirit no longer wanders the mortal world,
But ever dwells in the heavens.

After seven years at minimum, nine at most, one is certain to transcend the mortal world and ascend to the heavens above. In the heavens of the Desire Realm, beings are still born of qi-transformation, while in the Formless Realm, they take shape within nine-petaled lotuses, their forms fragrant. In dreams, one may glimpse green, azure, and white lotuses—signs of gradual attainment in the Dao. As progress is made, the lotus unfurls its bud; if the Dao is abandoned, the bud remains closed; if sins accumulate, the lotus withers.

*The Precious Scroll of the Limitless Salvation Sutra, Great Method of the Supreme Dao, Volume Twenty-Five Concludes*
*The Precious Scroll of the Limitless Salvation Sutra, Great Method of the Supreme Dao, Volume Twenty-Six: The Transmission of the Great Method*

The Mystic Master said: When you wish to invoke the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, focus your mind with wisdom. First, ensure your cinnabar chamber is pure and bright, free from the turmoil of the seven emotions and six desires. Concentrate your heart with utmost sincerity, never lapsing into negligence. Cultivate few desires, guard your thoughts, be content with the present, practice kindness and compliance, embrace frugality and patience, restrain anger, eat sparingly, reduce sleep, quiet your thoughts, moderate what you see and hear, speak little, regulate movement and stillness, and keep your mind fixed on this practice. At all times, whether in motion or repose, do not stray from this path.

Then, choose the ten auspicious days and eight solar terms—these are the most propitious times. Bathe both inwardly and outwardly, burn the finest incense, and reverently face the sacred image of the Jade Pure Highest Lord, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. Sit with your feet planted firmly, knock your teeth to gather the spirit, swallow saliva to harmonize the hun-soul, stabilize your mind, purify your thoughts, and regulate your breath evenly. Bow three times with your heart, settle your intention into oneness, and gaze intently upon the sacred countenance.

Begin with the ever-changing Jade Pure treasure crown, then observe the perfectly luminous celestial visage, its color like golden truth, round and radiant as a nine-hued rainbow. Next, behold the nine-hued Li Luo mantle, and the two hands displaying the celestial seal. Then, gaze downward to see the feet resting upon a golden and azure lotus throne, supported by a jade table and a sapphire jade desk.

Again, from the celestial visage and crown, observe each detail with utmost clarity. Close your eyes and hold the image in your heart. If it grows unclear, open your eyes to see it again, ensuring every detail is distinct, not missing even the finest hair. Close your eyes once more to visualize it. Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, perfect this visualization.

Thereafter, in a quiet and secluded place, burn incense and sit in silence. Visualize the northwest heaven of Jade Purity, the vast expanse of the Mystic Void, where a sudden blaze of light, bright as the sun and moon, fills the Dharma realm, leaving no mountains, rivers, grasses, or trees. Once this samadhi is achieved, you will see only the Heavenly Worthy in the emptiness, seated upon a golden and azure lotus throne in the same majestic posture as before. As he raises his hand to expound the Dharma, seventy-two auspicious signs and eighty-one excellent marks radiate from him. Observe each with a focused mind, ensuring your attention does not scatter.

Once this vision is clear, you will see the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, their luminous marks and virtues, as they raise their hands to proclaim the Great Method of the Limitless Salvation Sutra. Having beheld the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, you will further perceive the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions who respond and transform across kalpas, even unto boundless Heavenly Worthies. At first, they appear near, then gradually farther, growing ever larger as their lights connect. After seeing them, return your gaze to the northwest, where the vision remains as before, not missing even the finest detail.

Once this visualization is perfected, the Ten Directions above and below will likewise become clear and distinct. At times, you may simultaneously behold the heavens of the Ten Directions, hundreds of thousands of myriads of realms, all appearing in a single thought. All the Heavenly Worthies share one wisdom, awakening to the source of the Dao, illuminating all dharmas, and entering the unconditioned.

With the passage of time and the maturation of samadhi, you will naturally see the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions expounding the Great Method of the Limitless Salvation Sutra. All doubts will dissolve, and you will attain the original true Dao. If, due to heavy karmic obstructions from past lives, you cannot yet see the Heavenly Worthy, perform repentance six times a day and night, enter samadhi with focused contemplation, repent for all past evil deeds, and diligently advance in the Dao. Follow all virtuous joys, and though your mind may cling to habit, you will gradually succeed. Even if the Heavenly Worthy does not preach the Dharma, your mind will have already entered the blissful and wondrous fruit, your body and mind at peace. In time, you will also behold the Great Unconditioned Dao.

Next, after seven days and nights, you will clearly see the sacred realm of Jade Purity. The great samadhi and focused contemplation will have reached fruition. In quiet solitude, even while sleeping, concentrate on the Three Sages. Visualize the upper palace of the Niwan Palace, vast and radiant, emitting the Great Compassionate Light that pervades the Dharma realm. With every thought, invoke the Three Sages; with every intention, radiate light. Over time, the power of visualization and samadhi will mature. After seven days and nights without wavering, you will surely see the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounding the Dharma, his divine powers manifesting before you, instructing your heart and leading you into the source of the Dao. This is what is meant by "thought after thought without ceasing."

Bowing to the celestial visage, recite this verse:
*One mind, Three Sages; Three Sages, one light.*
*Light begets mind; brilliance arises from light.*
*One Sage’s mind connects; myriad transformations shine.*
*Perfect penetration, universal awakening—no delusion, no distraction.*

And again:
*With sincere focus, not a moment is wasted.*
*From emptiness, seek the real; even emptiness is not empty.*
*First empty, then respond; first attain, then penetrate.*
*Mind arises, mind ceases—without beginning, without end.*

*The Audience with the Jade Pure Emperor*

Within the secret chamber, burn incense, sit upright, and knock the teeth twenty-four times. Visualize entering three inches directly from the space between your brows—this is the Mud-Pill Palace, the abode of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. Recite the Hidden Secret of the Three Heavens (霐), summoning the Three Qi to descend from the Mud-Pill Palace into the Central Palace, then into the Lower Palace, and finally return to the Upper Palace. Visualize your primordial spirit paying homage to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. Recite the Hidden Secret without counting repetitions, envisioning the Three Qi filling the Nine Palaces with radiant light, illuminating all. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy sits within the Palace of Light upon a thousand-petaled lotus, his brilliance like the sun. He wears the Ever-Changing Jeweled Crown of Jade Pure, a nine-colored robe of morning essence and cinnabar-feathered treasure, with a halo of golden light. His form is golden, his countenance jade, and his two hands form the Mudra of Jade Pure. With each bow and rise, hold the vision clearly, imagining yourself beneath the Golden Portal. Kneel in ninefold reverence and secretly petition:

*"This humble dust-born servant, a male student of the Dao, [your name], prostrates in awe and trepidation, bowing deeply to petition the Supreme Three Heavens’ Jade Pure Sacred Realm, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Lord of the Void and Spontaneous Dao. By ancestral grace, I was born in an age of prosperity, fortunate to meet a master and receive the Great Dharma, entrusted with the Heavenly Seal and the governance of the Mysteries. Yet my transgressions accumulate daily, and I have not yet offered due gratitude. I humbly beseech Your celestial mercy to bestow a sacred decree, commanding the Northern Mansion of Fengdu, the Three Officials of Mount Tai, the River Sources and Spring Bends, and all divine overseers to absolve my thousand sins and ten thousand offenses, dispel calamities and misfortunes, dissolve karmic entanglements, inscribe my name in the Three Heavens, advance my cultivation of the Dao and refinement of truth, spare me from demonic trials, unblock stagnant energies in my womb-source, open knotted channels, and ensure the Three Realms bow in reverence and the myriad realms submit in homage. May I soon encounter a profound master to instruct me in the Great Dao of Golden Elixir and Lead-Mercury, teaching me to enter deep samadhi, awaken to the Profound Mystery, activate talismanic waters, and achieve efficacious summoning. May my merits and vows be fulfilled, allowing me to join the ranks of the Perfected Immortals. I am forever indebted to the boundless grace of the Great Dao. With utmost sincerity, I pray to Heaven and beseech the Sage—my heart trembles with urgency and awe. I await Your sacred decree."*

Upon finishing, perform six silent bows, kneel before the Emperor, and recite the Hidden Secret of the Three Heavens while awaiting the decree. Visualize the Three Qi’s purple light encircling your body, then bow three times in reverence before withdrawing, descending into the Crimson Palace, and finally returning to the Lower Field.

**Audience with the Supreme Pure**

Within the secret chamber, burn incense, sit upright, and knock the teeth twenty-four times. Visualize entering four inches directly from the space between your brows—this is the Flowing Pearl Palace, the abode of the Supreme Lord of the Dao. Recite the Hidden Secret of the Three Heavens (霐), summoning the Three Qi from the Mud-Pill’s Upper Palace into the Central Palace, then into the Lower Palace, and finally returning to the Upper Palace. Visualize your primordial spirit ascending with the Three Qi to pay homage. The Supreme Lord of the Dao sits within the Treasure Palace upon a thousand-petaled lotus, clad in a nine-colored robe of morning essence and purple-clouded treasure, a feathered garment of frost-like silk, and a crown of instantaneous transformations. Hold the vision clearly, imagining yourself beneath the Jade Steps. Kneel in ninefold reverence and secretly petition:

*"This humble dust-born servant, a male student of the Dao, [your name], prostrates in awe and trepidation, bowing deeply to petition the Boundless Great Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Dao, the Most High Emperor of Supreme Pure. Though of base and impure form, I have been fortunate to meet a master and receive sacred scriptures, fulfilling my duties in tranquil governance. Yet I fear my past and present lives are marred by transgressions—my three karmas and six senses burdened with a thousand faults and ten thousand errors, leaving no path for repentance. My heart is heavy with daily dread. I humbly beseech Your celestial mercy to grant absolution, for I am ever mindful of the weight of life and death, the relentless passage of seasons, the fleeting dew at dawn, the rare longevity of the sacred tree. Now, I uphold the secret classics of the Supreme Dao, ingesting true qi and divine talismans, preserving the Three Ones, refining my form, dissolving internal knots and womb-root obstructions, purging external impurities of the two months, dispelling illness, and severing the roots of misfortune. I earnestly pray to erase my name from the Black Register and strike it from the Book of Death, then penetrate the subtle mysteries, embodying the eternal virtue of the Dao. May my form and spirit unite in perfection, merging with the Dao’s truth, and may all sentient beings attain the fruition of the Dao. Daring to address Your celestial majesty, my heart overflows with urgency and awe. I await Your sacred decree."*

Upon finishing, perform six silent bows, kneel before the Emperor, and recite the Hidden Secret without counting repetitions while awaiting the decree. Visualize the Three Qi’s purple light encircling your body, then bow three times in reverence before withdrawing, descending into the Crimson Palace, and finally returning to the Lower Cinnabar Field.

---

**Audience with the Grand Pure**

Within the secret chamber, burn incense, sit upright, and knock the teeth twenty-four times. Visualize entering two inches directly from the space between your brows—this is the Grotto Chamber Palace, the dwelling of the Central Yellow Elder, the Supreme Lord. Recite the Hidden Secret of the Three Heavens (霐), summoning the Three Qi to descend from the Mud-Pill Palace into the Central Palace, then into the Lower Palace, and finally return to the Upper Palace. Visualize your primordial spirit paying homage to the Supreme Lord, reciting the Hidden Secret without counting repetitions. Envision the Three Qi’s light filling the Nine Palaces, illuminating all. The Supreme Lord Lao sits within the Golden Portal and Jade Hall upon a thousand-petaled lotus, his form golden, his countenance jade, wearing a seven-jewel crown and a nine-colored robe of morning essence and white-feathered frost-like silk. He leans upon a table of azure jasper, holding a whisk of feathers. Hold the vision clearly, imagining yourself beneath the Golden Portal. Kneel in ninefold reverence and secretly petition:

*"This humble dust-born servant, a male student of the Dao, [your name], prostrates in awe and trepidation, bowing deeply to petition the August Emperor of Primordial Virtue, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Most High Emperor of Grand Pure. By a thousand lifetimes’ fortune, I have met a master, received the Dharma Register, and been entrusted with guiding the people. Yet my transgressions accumulate daily, and I have not yet offered due gratitude. I humbly beseech Your celestial mercy to bestow a sacred decree."*

Petition the True Offices below to grant special pardon and forgiveness. May I, from this day forth, attain clarity of mind and awakening of intent, sharpness of hearing and brightness of sight. May the assembly of the ten thousand immortals confer upon me the Golden Elixir, dispel calamities and avert misfortunes, so that I may attain the state of divine transcendence. As a patriarch of the teaching, may I propagate the Great Dao, deliver the hidden and the manifest, and benefit all living beings, becoming a seed-people for future sages and securing a place to abide with Heaven and Earth.

With reverence, I pray for the clarity of the firmament and the purity of the earth, the radiance of the sun and the moon, the orderly movement of the stars and constellations, and the responsiveness of mountains and peaks. May wind and rain come in due season, water and fire remain latent, the myriad heavens enjoy peace, and kalpic disasters not arise. May all creatures that fly and crawl alike attain liberation and ascension.

I have presumptuously offended celestial majesty; my humble sentiments are overwhelmed with urgency and trepidation. I prostrate myself in wait for the sacred decree.

Upon concluding the petition, bow six times in the heart, kneel before the Emperor, and silently recite the hidden and esoteric invocations without regard to number, awaiting the imperial response. Envision the threefold qi of purple light encircling your body, then perform three profound bows and withdraw. Descend into the Crimson Palace, then return to the Lower Cinnabar Field.

The Mysterious Elixir Palace lies five inches directly inward from the midpoint between the brows, where the Most High Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven resides. The Hall of Light Palace lies one inch directly inward from the midpoint between the brows, where the Great Emperor of Longevity and the Jade Sovereign of the Divine Empyrean reside. To the left of the Hall of Light Palace is the dwelling of Lord Han the Elder. The Nine Mornings of the Northern Dipper reside above the Mud Pill Palace in the brain, with the Pointer Stars before them and the Two Stars of the Northern Culmen’s August Emperor within the Dipper.

When the adept wishes to perform rituals, observe which palace governs the matter at hand. For the Great Yellow Register Fast, notify all palaces and report to the Nine Dark Realms. For refinement and deliverance, report to the Jade Purity and Lord Han the Elder. For thunder and rain rites, report to the Divine Empyrean. The prayer texts need not be repeated in full. When paying homage to the Emperor and Master to receive qi...

Within the quiet chamber, the adept kindles incense, strikes the teeth together, and in accordance with the former *Chaoyuan* method, visualizes the self kneeling beneath the Golden Portal. Prostrating in reverence, the adept secretly petitions:

*"This humble dust-born adept, a male student of the Dao named [so-and-so], humbly reflects: by fortune spanning a thousand ages, I have been granted the grace to receive the transformative teachings. I revere the numinous treasure of the Great Rites, the true net of the Three Caverns. Above, it dispels the calamities and mutations of Heaven and Earth; below, it rectifies the transgressions of yin and yang’s appointed times. In the hidden, it can deliver the Three Paths; in cultivation, it can liberate from the cycle of birth and death. Vast, it encompasses all; minute, it leaves nothing wanting. Its boundless mysteries run too deep to fathom.*

*Today, on this auspicious day, I reverently follow the Jade Statutes to receive the various numinous qi. I implore the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Vacuous Non-Being, the Jade Purity Great Emperor, to broadly extend compassion and specially bestow deliverance.*

*Having now ingested the various numinous qi, I refine the Five Viscera, purging defilement and turbid vapors. I humbly beseech the celestial mercy to deign to send down the luminous, correct, and true Dao-qi of each station’s *Yaoguang*, entering my body. Within, it purges the filth of the heart; without, it tempers the essence of the eyes. Whatever the task, its numinous efficacy shall be manifest.*

*Now, reverently before Your presence, I request to receive the true qi. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head, prostrate myself, and again bow in reverence."*

Next, the adept forms the Jade Purity mudra with the left and right hands and recites the *qi*-invoking incantation:

*"The adept receives qi thrice yearly: the qi of Heaven above, gazing to Qian; the qi of Earth below, bowing to the Diurnal Sun; the qi of the first month and the *zi* month; the qi of the Five Stars in the first month’s *yin* hour; the correct qi of the Five Directions and Three Sovereigns; the qi of the Six Offices of the Southern Dipper in the *zi*, *shen*, and *yin* hours; the qi of the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper in the due south; the qi of the Three Terraces Perfected in the due north; the concealed inner names of the Three Heavens at the Dipper’s head; the divine qi by which the Three Masters of the northwest deliver my spirit; the wondrous qi of the Five Directions and Five Marchmounts that sustains the body; the qi of the Five Directions and Three Paths’ general overseers; the gentle, harmonious qi of the Six *Ding* at the *Qian* position of *zi* and *wu*; the martial, unyielding qi of the Six *Jia* in the *ding* direction; the qi of the Divine Immortals and Grand Unity in the *jia* direction; the Seven Primes’ true qi of the Divine Tiger in the direction of the day; the qi governed by the Four Straight of the Northern Dipper’s yin; the correct, true, life-generating qi of the Highest Emperor for the year, month, establishment, day, hour, and direction; the true qi of the Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Woman at the Heavenly Gate; the inner-refining qi of the Three Perfected in the southwest; the qi of the Cloud, Thunder, and Rain Departments at the Heavenly Gate.*

*In the *xun* direction: Heaven cannot cover me, Earth cannot bear me. Whoever opposes me shall die; whoever collides with me shall perish."*

Hasten, hasten in accordance with the statutes and decrees.

Next, perform the Mudra of the Five Emperors and Three Paths:
Red Apricot, Thunder Black Ink, *Chou* Grinds True, *Dui* Stocking Wax, *Wu* Numinous Treasure.
The middle finger turns to revive *Zhongxing*; alone, it shifts to *Duli*; it may clarify *Hanming*; it gathers as *Gongdu*; it corrects the angles and aligns; it assembles and seizes the hun-souls.

*Gongdu* assembles the hun-souls, summoning the swift messengers of the eight directions, celestial spirits and earthly deities, the myriad numina all converging—united under the decree of Heaven and Earth.

Conjoin the radiance of the Heavenly Emperor’s sun; conjoin the radiance of the Heavenly Emperor’s sun.

Upon reciting the incantation, bow twice. With both hands in the Jade Emperor Mudra, visualize the *qi* of the Three Heavens returning to the body. Then visualize the preceding *qi*, following the Three *Qi* into the body, entering the Lower Cinnabar Field. Thus concludes.

On the first day of the month at the *zi* hour, ingest *qi* and recite the Hidden Taboo of the Three Heavens ten thousand times. Thereby, one may communicate with the perfected and reach the numinous, command the clouds, thunder, rain, and lightning, and summon the deities of Heaven and Earth. Do not raise the voice; let not the ears hear. Maintain a fast for one day, abstaining from meat.

**Chapter on Atoning for Past Transgressions**

The essence of cultivating the Dao lies foremost in minimizing faults. If one does not repent of their transgressions, they drift ever farther from the Way. Even if one practices talismanic methods, they will not ascend to the highest stages of the Dao. Should their conduct remain unchecked, how can they subdue ghosts and spirits, let alone submit memorials or deliver the living and the dead? The bureaus of merit and transgression record even the slightest misdeed without error.

In the Jin dynasty, Xu Yuanyou retreated into the mountains and forests, diligently cultivating the Dao and gradually attaining the rank of the perfected. Yet the Three Officials dispatched Zhou Fang and others to present him with a vermilion tablet of his transgressions, rebuking him thus: "Those who aspire to study the Dao and long for immortality, who seek to be enrolled among the perfected, who nest their profound minds in the distant, and who revere the numinous with utmost sincerity—must first accumulate worldly merits, avoid calamities and evils, plant the roots of hidden virtue, and extend benevolence upward. Only then may they ascend to the ranks of the perfected and inscribe their names in the Azure Palace."

From this, it is clear that those who have not yet reached Xu Yuanyou’s level must surely strive to minimize faults and cultivate themselves. For those who uphold the precepts, practice the methods, seek immortality, and study the Dao, it is essential to repent of past transgressions and accumulate future merits through diligent effort.

Thus *The Treatise on the Mysterious Principle* states: "Faults are to be corrected and never repeated; merits are to be established without wearying midway." This is called daily renewing one’s virtue, whereby Heaven itself grants its protection. If one merely performs the rituals of prayer and repentance with the mouth while the heart lacks any thought of self-examination, if one’s past transgressions precede and future misdeeds follow, if one adorns the exterior while corrupting the interior—then even if one exhausts the body and wearies the form, gazes at the stars and worships the moon, observes fasts and upholds precepts, burns incense and recites scriptures, all such efforts will be in vain.

There are those who boast grand words to deceive the world, claiming that since their sins are not accumulated and their evils not committed, there is no need for repentance or renunciation of the teachings. Such extreme posturing is excessive. The proper way lies in balanced moderation, neither exceeding nor falling short. One should repent sincerely in the heart, reflect upon faults when recognized, follow the scriptures and uphold the teachings, and practice the rituals according to the established forms. Thus may the records of sins be erased from the courts of the Three Officials and the Five Emperors, and one’s name inscribed in the realms of the Ten Poles and Nine Heavens. By establishing merit without slackening, the body may ascend and take flight as an immortal. The state shares in this, and one should not hinder oneself—those with resolve often accomplish their aims.

For repentance, aside from the day of the Autumn Equinox each year, one should choose the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, one’s own birthday, the days of *jiazi* and *gengshen*, and other auspicious occasions to enter a quiet chamber, or a temple, mountain, or secluded place. There, one should burn incense, focus the mind, and reflect upon faults and transgressions. First, sit in solemn silence beside the altar, deeply contemplating all actions and deeds from birth to the present—none without transgression, and unwholesome deeds innumerable. Trembling with remorse, one should regret not having torn open the heart and poured out the gall, swearing never to repeat such acts. Overcome with shame, one feels unworthy to occupy this place. Then, rising and adjusting one’s robes, one composes body and spirit, ascends the altar, and begins the invocation. Where no altar is present, set up an incense table and arrange the ritual space accordingly. Perform the entrance incantation, offer incense, and follow the prescribed rites of prayer and repentance. In the morning, begin facing east; at night, begin facing north. Conduct repentance in the five directions, adhering to the established ritual forms. After kindling the incense burner and following the proper sequence, offer incense thrice before proceeding with the rites, which should resemble the natural court audience. However, such matters are best conducted in secrecy, and solitary practice is preferable to excessive complexity. Thus, only the texts for repentance in the four directions are compiled here, to be adapted as circumstances require.

**First, the Incense Prayer:**
Dao incense, virtue incense, non-action incense,
Non-action, pure, and natural incense,
Wondrous cavernous true incense,
Numinous treasure wisdom incense,
Incense transcending the Three Realms,
Incense of the royal realm.
Filling the jade towers of the Jade Capital,
Pervading the Dharma realms of the cosmos.
With this incense now burned,
We offer it to the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Realms of the Great Dao of Emptiness,
The August Heavenly Emperor,
The Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity and the Northern Pole,
The Heavenly Emperor of the Purple Tenuity,
The August Earthly Deity of the Rear,
The Lords of the Thirty-Two Heavens,
The Ten Thousand Heavenly Emperors,
The Eleven Luminaries of the Upper Clarity,
The Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper of the Central Heaven,
The Lords of the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water,
The Four Saintly Marshals of the Northern Pole,
The Five Masters of the Numinous Treasure,
The Twenty-Eight Constellations of the Four Directions,
The Five Great Demon Kings of the Three Realms,
The Flying Heavenly Kings of the Ten Directions,
The Great Emperor of the Northern Darkness of Fengdu,
The Great Emperor of the Eastern Radiance of Fusang,
The Sacred Emperors of the Five Peaks and Five Heavens,
The Grotto-Heavens and Blessed Lands,
The Famous Mountains and Pure Retreats,
The Lords and Perfected of the Registers,
The Divine Officers and Generals of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements,
The Officials and Attendants of the Three Realms,
All majestic spirits.
By this fragrant cloud, we universally extend our offerings.
Jade blossoms scatter their radiance,
Nine *qi* congeal into mist,
Fragrant clouds and dense fogs
Pierce straight through the heavens.
The Golden Lad attendant of incense
And the Jade Maiden transmitter of words
Ascend to the presence of the Emperors.
Let my petition be heard,
And all be as spoken.
The ritual officer, [Name], on this auspicious day,
Purifies the heart and washes clean,
Praying to the Perfected and invoking the Dao.
First, we extend our wishes for the imperial court and the altars of soil and grain,
For the ancestral spirits and the departed,
That they ascend to the Nine Heavens
And bestow blessings for ten thousand generations.
May the present emperor’s foundation endure forever,
His reign prosper and flourish,
His sacred longevity equal heaven and earth,
His virtuous teachings harmonize with creation.
May all directions turn toward goodness,
All grains attain abundant harvest,
All sentient beings awaken to the Perfect Dao,
And all, without limit, ascend to the realm of glory and joy.
May the Great Teaching flourish,
And the True Dharma be boundless.
Daring to express these humble wishes,
We humbly approach the imperial majesty.
Your servant, with utmost trepidation and reverence,
Is overwhelmed with awe and urgency,
And prostrates himself in submission.
We respectfully make this known.

**Invoking the Directions:**
Your servant [Name], with sincere devotion, takes refuge in the Heavenly Worthies of the Numinous Treasure in the ten directions—east, south, west, north, the four corners, above, and below—the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Twenty-Eight Constellations of the cosmos, the Perfected and Sacred Ones of Heaven, the True Lords of the Five Peaks, the mountains, rivers, seas, grotto-heavens, blessed lands, and all divine immortals and spirit officials.

**Next, facing north, bow thrice and kneel.**
(In the daytime, begin with the east; at night, begin with the north.)

The ritual officer, [Name], with sincere devotion, body and spirit, takes refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Limitless Numinous Treasure of the North and Northeast, the Eight Heavenly Emperors of the North, the High Perfected and Sacred Ones of the North, the Seven Constellations of the Dipper, Ox, Girl, Void, Danger, House, and Wall, the True Lord of the Black Emperor of the Northern Peak Hengshan, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands of the North, the mountains, rivers, and seas, and all true spirits and divine immortals and spirit officials of the northern realm.

I have heard that the Great Dao, in its compassion, opens the path of repentance for transgressions. The High Perfected, in their transformation, establish the rituals for seeking forgiveness. Without beseeching their grace, how could one be absolved of faults and escape punishment? Reflecting upon myself, I am foolish, base, and of humble station, dull and of common endowment. Yet, by the grace of the true wind, I have encountered the turning of the Dao’s fortune, long held the registers of the Dharma, and presumptuously worn the cap and robes of the clergy. Unable to exert myself to establish merit, I have instead persisted in committing sins. I have known no restraint, nor carefully cultivated my conduct. I fear for the countless ancestors and forebears of past generations, and for myself across thousands of lives and kalpas, as well as for the causes of former existences. Extending to the present life, in all my deliberations and actions, and among all my household and kin, I have committed grave evils and accumulated deep transgressions—boundless and immeasurable, difficult to name or describe. These are bound within the courts of Heaven and Earth, recorded in the palaces of the sun, moon, and stars, never to be pardoned for eternal kalpas, forever without release. Fearing their retribution, I dread the onset of calamity.

With this first confession of my return to the Way, I humbly beseech full purification and absolution. May Heaven bestow its grace and pardon, may the Dao awaken its compassion and mercy, may the myriad sages pour forth blessings, and may the host of perfected beings confer felicity. May all my sins—those of nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages of forebears, as well as those of this present self across ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives, down to the towering transgressions of this day and the profound iniquities of this world—be eradicated at their root, my name stricken from the ledgers of guilt. Thus may I swiftly attain the true Dao, encounter a genuine master, and know peace and prosperity in body and life, while my disciples, household, kin, and dependents enjoy tranquility and well-being.

Moreover, I pray that the divine consciousness of my ancestors, the souls of my masters and friends, my departed kin, and all my deceased family may dwell forever in bliss and eternal freedom. May the six paths and three realms of suffering, the four births and ten thousand kinds of beings, all be delivered and transformed.

Overwhelmed by shame and remorse, I offer this fervent and earnest prayer with utmost reverence.

Next, facing the East:
The humble servant [Name], with sincere devotion, body and spirit returned in homage, prostrates before the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the East and Southeast, the Eight Heavenly Sovereigns of the East, the Perfected and Sagely Ones of the East, the Stellar Lords of the Horn, Neck, Root, Heart, Tail, and Winnowing Basket constellations, the Azure Emperor Perfected Lord of Mount Tai in the East, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands of the East, its mountains and rivers, seas and all numinous spirits, and the divine officials of the Eastern Realm.

The servant’s plea remains as before.

Next, facing the Center:
The humble servant [Name], with sincere devotion, body and spirit returned in homage, prostrates before the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Upper and Lower Realms, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Sovereigns of the Three Luminaries, Nine Empyreans, Great Canopy, and Boundless Heavens, the Five Elder Thearchs, the Rulers of the Heavenly Courts, the countless Perfected Ones, the true spirits of the Ten Lands of Mount Fengdu’s Dark Realm, the Thirty-Six Earthly Sovereigns, the Yellow Emperor Perfected Lord of Mount Song in the Center, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands of the Center, its mountains and rivers, seas and all numinous spirits, and the divine immortals and officials of the Upper and Lower Realms.
The servant’s plea remains as before.

Finally, returning to my place before the altar.

With sincere devotion, I bow my head in reverence to the Most High Boundless Dao.
With sincere devotion, I bow my head in reverence to the Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures.
With sincere devotion, I bow my head in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

Next, I humbly address:
Servant [Name], with utmost sincerity, respectfully invokes the Boundless Dao, the Supreme Thearch, the High Perfected Ones, the mighty numina of the Three Realms, and the host of sages of the Ten Directions.
On this day, as I repent my transgressions and seek forgiveness, entering the oratory to cultivate the true, I have been permitted to present my plea, humbly beseeching great pardon.
May it be wished that the Dark Realm erase my sins, the Immortal Courts inscribe my name, that I encounter perfected beings on the Way, and study without demonic trials.
How dare I not redouble my virtuous thoughts, deeply reflect upon past wrongs, and aspire to unite with the true Dao, forever abiding in its tranquil shade? May the Ten Directions rejoice together, and may my nine generations of ancestors receive blessings.
For this supreme cause, I recite the *Lingbao Tianzun* of the Ten Directions, whose boundless, inconceivable merits are beyond reckoning.

Next, exit the chamber as per the usual protocol.

The *Natural Audience of Lingbao* begins by invoking the sacred, then paying homage to the Ten Directions, followed by the threefold repentance, then the dedication of merits, and now the fivefold thanksgiving for transgressions—this being the extended intent of the *Natural Audience of Lingbao*. It concludes here, for the five directions are valued for their simplicity and ease of practice.
The Jade Sounds and Brahman chants are not performed, for their power lies in silent resonance and profound sincerity.
All who uphold the Dao and cultivate the true—regardless of the rank of their registers—may practice accordingly. With prolonged observance and deep introspection, sins diminish, blessings arise, and one attains perfection and the Dao.

**Rite for the Three Primes and Eight Nodal Days: Audience with the Perfected and Thanksgiving for Transgressions**

First, form the Mudra of the Supreme Thearch, recite the Entering-Chamber Spell, stand at the Earthly Portal, face the Heavenly Gate, and close the qi while silently reciting the spell.

**Entering the Chamber**
The Dharma Master faces the Earthly Portal, lightly strikes the teeth three times, and recites the secret spell. Laozi’s visualization diagram states: Envision the Four Luminous Merit Officers, one Transmitting Perfected Messenger, two Jade Lads for Conveying Words, and two Jade Maidens attending the oratory.
The spell reads:
Four Luminous Merit Officers, Transmitting Perfected Messenger,
Jade Lads for Conveying Words, Jade Maidens attending the oratory.
For this servant, communicate with the true spirits of the Dao chamber.
May the qi of the Upper Prime descend and enter my body.
Upon completing the spell, enter the chamber, stepping first with the left foot.

**Entering the Chamber at Night**
The procedure for entering the chamber is the same as above.

**Laozi’s Visualization Diagram** states: Envision the Four Upper Merit Officers, two Dragon-Tiger Messengers, one Attending Pure Maiden, one Luminous Youth, and one Upper Mystery Maiden.

The spell reads:
Four Upper Merit Officers, Dragon-Tiger Messengers,
True Unity generates qi, Attending Pure Maiden.
At night when petitions are made, may the Luminous One be granted.
Youth and Upper Mystery Maiden,
enter the Yellow Chamber with this servant,
conveying all petitions to be heard above.

**Three Bows, Holding the Censer, Invoking the Sages, and Proclaiming the Rites**
This servant has heard that the One Qi unfolds the mechanism, grasping the transformative pivot in the boundless. The Three Heavens establish the model, extending the mysterious pattern through primordial chaos. Five thousand four hundred scriptures and precepts are spread below in the dusty world. The thirty-two heavens’ Brahman qi governs the supreme principles above. Contemplating that fortune and misfortune have no fixed gate, observing that fullness and emptiness follow their destined numbers, the transmitted Dharma registers open salvation for heaven and humanity. The Dao emerged at Crane Cry Mountain, where Orthodox Unity propagated the teachings of cultivating truth. Its merit shone in the Dragon Han era, as the Primordial One bestowed the scriptures for the world. The Great Dao is hard to name, yet pure sincerity can reach it. On this auspicious day, I purify the hall to pay homage to the Perfected and repent transgressions.

May the Golden Lads prepare the mats, the Jade Maidens tend the incense, ascending to the court of wondrous existence, directly entering the realm of emptiness. The phoenix flutes play softly, as dragon spirits unfold the azure heavens’ hymns. The ethereal simurgh carriages, feathered riders arrayed with crimson banners, stand guard. Seven chariots and eight reins float upon the vast qi through the void. The Three Realms and Ten Directions illuminate with divine radiance, sweeping away defilement.

This servant, a humble adept at the Mysterious Pass, has but newly received the red writ, his form born of foolishness, his nature endowed with ignorance. He has violated the precepts and teachings, accumulating transgressions and faults. Now, in accordance with the immortal statutes, he reverently presents the secret rites.

May the Lord of Jade Capital, the Venerable Master of the Golden Portal, universally bestow boundless grace, distantly showering abundant blessings. Open the path of renewal, place him within the pardonable statutes, and sweep away his deep-seated transgressions. Clear his entanglements, descending the Great Prime’s qi to refine his spirit into a numinous vessel. Temper his bones and renew his sinews, preserving his form to abide in the world. May grace return to his ancestors, enabling them to ascend. Extend kindness to both foes and kin, that all may attain harmony and release. A thousand faults and ten thousand errors dissolve in a single thought. The eight difficulties and seven harms scatter in the four seasons. Cultivation progresses gradually, and the Dao is advanced without demonic obstruction. One qi aids and sustains, a hundred spirits protect and assist. May he fulfill the covenant of ascending to Perfection, ever accompanying the company of immortals. May he unite with the Dao, his form and spirit both wondrous.

**Next, Kneeling to Repent**
This servant wholeheartedly takes refuge in body, takes refuge in spirit, and takes refuge in life to the Transformative Lords of the Three Purities, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, and the sacred assembly within the *Sutra of Limitless Salvation*.

From past kalpas to this present life, through the three karmas and six senses, the five emotions and seven desires, past misfortunes and former deeds, the records of the mysterious statutes, yang transgressions and yin faults—all are inscribed in the Black Book. Through this repentance, may they all be dissolved and eradicated.

May the vast numen illumine and perceive, may the cinnabar portal bestow compassion, bestowing life upon the walking corpse, flowing grace upon the decayed bones. May the knots of the womb and origin be untied, the seven ancestors ascend, the mind’s realm be without dust, demonic obstructions disperse. Taking refuge in the Great Dao, washing away deep-seated transgressions, may calamities be extinguished without bound, and merit universally extend to all. After attaining the Dao, ascending into formlessness, may he unite with the Dao.

**Next, Uttering the Ten Great Vows**
The spell reads:
Three Pure Jade Emperors, Three Primordial Ladies of the Plain,
Supreme High Numinous Ones, Great Spirits of the Immortal Capital.
On this auspicious day, the wishes are declared:
First vow: to soar through the skies, becoming an immortal of long life.
Second vow: that heaven and earth merge with the radiant flying clouds.
Third vow: that the Five Peaks endure with this body forever.
Fourth vow: that the seven ancestors be freed from grievances and transgressions.
Fifth vow: that the Imperial Lords sever the bonds of the womb and origin.
Sixth vow: that in life after life, wisdom be awakened and luminous.
Seventh vow: that demonic spirits be vanquished, the Six Heavens’ forces be cut down.
Eighth vow: that all be opened and penetrated, communicating with the hidden and numinous.
Ninth vow: that in this assembly, none fail to fulfill their words.
Tenth vow: to ascend as a flying immortal, paying homage at the Three Primes.

**Next, Dedication**
Bowing to the Master of the Mysterious Cavern of Numinous Treasure, the true teacher of the *Sutra of Limitless Salvation*.
The Dao embraces heaven and earth, yet cannot be named;
the Dharma pervades yin and yang, beyond thought or discussion.
Responding to conditions, it transforms to save all beings,
transcending the Three Realms and Ten Directions.
Majestic and peerless, a mountain of merit and virtue,
the mind turns toward it, thought after thought, without ceasing.
The secret Dharma received today
dissolves above the heavenly calamities and kalpic destinies,
delivers below the multitudes of people.
Revives the dead to complete their forms,
heals the sick, eliminates misfortune, and aids the upright.
When merit is complete and conduct fulfilled,
swiftly consume the golden liquid elixir.
When the mind comprehends the numinous,
advance to receive the Jade Emperor’s decree.
For the highest good, recite the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions.

**Exiting the Chamber**
After completing the exit through the Earthly Portal, turn to face the altar, strike the teeth three times, and envision one Jade Maiden.

The spell reads:
Emerging from yin into yang, the myriad spirits open and communicate.
The matters concluded, petition the closure of the Yellow Chamber.
Attending Pure Maidens, clearly prepare the spirit palace.

After the spell, exit the chamber, stepping first with the right foot.

**Exiting the Chamber at Night**
After completing the exit through the Earthly Portal, turn to face the altar, strike the teeth three times, and envision one Maiden.

The spell reads:
The Supreme Yin of the Mysterious Above, the eight windows open and luminous.
For petitions made, the Maiden communicates the numinous.
When matters are concluded, return to position; the myriad spirits withdraw in tranquility.

**Daily Rites for Entering the Oratory, Burning Incense, and Paying Homage**
First, form the Jade Clarity mudra with both hands, clench firmly, visualize the spirit, strike the teeth, stand facing the Heavenly Master, and recite the spell:
Heavenly scriptures spread in array, descending from the Grand Tenuity.
Primal transformation generates spirits, the numinous smoke coils ninefold.
Eight effulgences and six circuits, upheld by the imperial destiny.
To the left, the Azure Lord attends; to the right, the Imperial Consort is invoked.
The Venerable One of Southern Prosperity refines and repels defilement.
The dancing carriage of Crimson Brilliance unfolds the true mechanism.
Today is a great celebration, the myriad Dao return in unison.
Unite the upright qi, preserving heaven from decline.

**Universal Proclamation to the Three Realms, Swift as Dragons on the Wind**

The incense-prayer invokes the sacred:
With earnest mind, I reflect—early did I enter the Mystic Pass, long have I relied upon the Yellow and the Old, receiving the sheltering grace of the Great Dao, dwelling in the abode of truth to rest and abide. Ashamed am I for lacking the causes of the Ten Goodnesses, yet striving to praise the blessings of the Six Paths.

Since donning the dark robe, years have passed like seasons, yet I have failed to stir the numinous to gratitude, and in movement, lightly transgressed the precepts. Zealous at first, slackening later—begun but not completed. In upholding the law, sometimes straying; in practicing benevolence, not upright. Burning incense, losing proper measure; in recollection and invocation, violating the statutes.

I fear the Three Peng will secretly record my transgressions, and the Six Treasuries inscribe my offenses in bright script. Thus, I pour forth my sincere devotion, gazing upward to knock upon the Void. I pray that sins and evils be absolved, that transgressions and faults be dissolved.

May my name be perfected in supreme goodness, my life aligned with long endurance. May mystic merit accumulate through the Three Thousands, and the elixir of nine refinements be early attained. May the Yellow Register and White Tablet erase the names of the dead and inscribe those of the living. May the Golden Gates and Jade Capital grant ascent without descent.

May the Immortal Bureaus record my goodness, and the Ghostly Registers remove my misfortunes. May the Eight Effulgences of the Golden Script grant the art of refining qi and cultivating truth. May the Five Writings of the Jade Seal bestow the power of long life and enduring vision.

May the Dharma abide in peace, the oratory shine in radiance. May the perils of Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire never cause alarm or harm. May the calamities of green, yellow, white, and black all be swept away.

Further, I pray that right and wrong be dispelled in equal measure, that clothing and sustenance arise naturally, that demonic obstructions not arise, and that anxieties and misfortunes not arrive. Above, may I repay the kindness of sovereign, teacher, and parents; below, may I relieve the suffering of those lost in the dark and stagnant paths.

May I drive out the perverse and aid the upright, revive the teachings and establish merit. May the hundred spirits return in homage, the myriad deities tremble in submission. May form and spirit both attain subtlety, uniting with the Dao in truth.

*The Great Rites of the Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation, Scroll Twenty-Eight*

**The Mysterious Register of Immortal Ranks, Superior Grade**

The Mysterious Master says: Great merit and transgression, blessing and misfortune—whether vast or slight—augment or diminish one’s years and lifespan. There are three ranks and nine grades, all governed by the Celestial Prohibitions of the Supreme Mysterious Capital; all beings ought to observe and uphold them.

**Superior Rank:**
- **Superior Grade, Highest:** Augments by three *ji* (thirty-six years).
- **Superior Grade, Middle:** Augments by two *ji* (twenty-four years).
- **Superior Grade, Lowest:** Augments by one *ji* (twelve years).

**Middle Rank:**
- **Middle Grade, Highest:** Augments by ten years.
- **Middle Grade, Middle:** Augments by nine years.
- **Middle Grade, Lowest:** Augments by seven years.

**Inferior Rank:**
- **Inferior Grade, Highest:** Augments by half a *ji* (six years).
- **Inferior Grade, Middle:** Augments by five years.
- **Inferior Grade, Lowest:** Augments by three years.

**Superior Rank:**
- **Superior Grade, Highest:** Diminishes or augments by 240 *suan* (lifespan increments).
- **Superior Grade, Middle:** Diminishes or augments by 120 *suan*.
- **Superior Grade, Lowest:** Diminishes or augments by 100 *suan*.

**Middle Rank:**
- **Middle Grade, Highest:** Diminishes or augments by 90 *suan*.
- **Middle Grade, Middle:** Diminishes or augments by 50 *suan*.
- **Middle Grade, Lowest:** Diminishes or augments by 40 *suan*.

**Inferior Rank:**
- **Inferior Grade, Highest:** Diminishes or augments by 30 *suan*.
- **Inferior Grade, Middle:** Diminishes or augments by 20 *suan*.
- **Inferior Grade, Lowest:** Diminishes or augments by 10 *suan*.

The Mysterious Master says: For minor good and minor evil, there are further diminutions or augmentations of ten *suan* or fewer, down to a single *suan*.

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate Mysterious Potency says: One who accomplishes merit of the Superior Rank’s highest grade must not presume upon transgressions of the same rank. Minor good deeds must be recorded daily, and minor evils must be expunged daily. Accumulate minor good to form great merit; dispel minor evil to achieve great virtue. Though one may accomplish merit of the highest rank, transgressions of the superior grade are not pardoned. Scholars who recite these teachings shall enjoy blessings as vast as mountains; those who treat them with contempt shall incur calamities lasting ten thousand kalpas.

---

**Middle Rank**

The Mysterious Master says: Male immortals of the highest order are called *Heavenly Worthies*; female immortals of the highest order are called *Primal Ladies*. Those whose form and spirit have not yet both attained subtlety still possess a corporeal frame and mortal remains; they are not permitted honorific titles.

For merit accrued in the mundane world:
- Great merit: three years per promotion.
- Middle merit: seven years per promotion.
- Lesser merit: nine years per promotion.

Those without merit ascend once every seven hundred days.

On the first day, one’s post is examined in the Courts of the Yin Realm. Next, one enters the offices of the Water Bureau and the lords of mountains and rivers. Then, the Earth Bureau and the lords of serene abodes and blessed lands. Next, the lords of grotto-heavens. Then, the immortal officials of the Ten Continents and Three Islands, gradually advancing into the Celestial Bureaus.

For those who perform merit in the world and establish the ten virtues of great meritorious conduct, whose inner and outer merit is complete, the place where the spirit is examined and the post assigned is the Great Yin’s refining of the corpse. When the allotted years are fulfilled, form and immortal unite and ascend.

If merit and virtue are incomplete in inner and outer cultivation, the spirit is divided to administer affairs, establishing a residence in the yin courts of Heaven, Earth, and Water.

To enter this Mysterious Stage of the Pure Rank, one must partake in the Dipper’s conferral of scriptures, sever the name of death, and ascend to the Southern Court. Merit and virtue manifest in reform; one ascends the immortal ranks, with years and deeds compared and examined, and may be promoted within the immortal grades. Presumptuous transgressions are impeached by the Three Officials. One must guard against this diligently. Violations result in demotion, subtraction of years, and punishment by forfeiture of merit or degradation of office.

**Initial Entry into Immortal Offices:**

- True Stewards Upholders of the Dharma of the Bamboo Grove.
- True Stewards Upholders of the Dharma of the Void Brilliance.
- True Stewards Upholders of the Dharma of the Contemplative Brilliance.

The Mysterious Master says: These ten ranks are comparable to the ranks of the celestial chancellors; all require fifty instances of reform. One promotion requires forty instances of reform to enter the ten ranks of Immortal Stewards.

From this point downward, one enters the Form Realm:
- Upholders of the Dharma, Immortal Stewards of the Supreme Resplendence, Primal Endowment, Supreme Peace, Manifest Stability, Primordial August, Filial Radiance, Venerable Gravity, Non-Thought, Joyous Obscurity, Boundless, Luminous Court, and Primal Grotto.
- Upholders of the Dharma, Superior Immortals.
- Upholders of the Dharma, True Stewards.

All require sixty instances of reform to enter the ranks of Immortal Stewards. Seventy instances of reform to enter the ranks of Superior Immortals. Eighty instances of reform to enter the ranks of True Stewards.

From here upward, one enters the Formless Realm:
- Upholders of the Dharma, Immortal Stewards of the Supreme Literature, Supreme Simplicity, Primal Superiority, Supreme Release, Brahmanic Ascent, Equitable Nurturance.
- Upholders of the Dharma, Superior Immortals.
- Upholders of the Dharma, True Stewards.
- Upholders of the Dharma, True Stewards of the Supreme Clarity.
- Upholders of the Dharma, True Stewards of the Highest Clarity.
- Upholders of the Dharma, True Stewards of the Jade Clarity.

The Mysterious Master says: These ranks all require ninety instances of reform to enter the ranks of Immortal Stewards. One hundred instances of reform to enter the ranks of Superior Immortals. One hundred and twenty instances of reform to enter the ranks of True Stewards.

Gradually ascending to the ranks of Perfected Ones, all are specially enfeoffed by the Supreme Emperor, concurrently holding immortal offices across the heavens, earths, and waters—these too are special enfeoffments. Next, one enters the service of the Heavenly Mechanism’s Inner Ministry, the Heavenly Mechanism’s General Ministry, or the Great Mystery’s General Ministry. With each instance of reform, a memorial is submitted to the Heavenly Ministries, where it is compared and verified against demonic records. Only when the Demon Bureau confirms the absence of demonic interference, and true merit restrains the Demon Bureau, may one be recommended for merit by the Demon Bureau. Upon endorsement by the Three Officials and Five Emperors, and testimony from the myriad heavens, one’s rank is elevated—demotion follows the same process. Without penetrating insight into the hundred spirits and divine communion with the Heavenly Bureau, none can fathom these mysteries. Separate celestial immortal statutes are recorded daily in the Divine Court’s Golden Gates.

For those granted robes and established residences, who pay homage to the Primordial, observe the Dipper, and inspect the caverns, the great stabilization of the Seven Classics must be mastered. Only when merit is complete may one fully grasp the supreme mysteries of the Dark Mystery.

These taboo names of the Celestial Emperors are all inscribed in vermilion crystal with azure characters, concealed within the Supreme Clarity Imperial Palace. They are the true names of the Celestial Emperors, not transmitted to the lower world. The taboo names within the scriptures are hidden designations—all empty and cavernous, naturally numinous chapters. Nine harmonies and ten unions transform into the Supreme Clarity, boundless mysteries too profound to detail. Reciting them ten thousand times, one ascends to perfection in broad daylight. As the saying goes: *"I possess the cavernous chapters; ten thousand recitations make one an immortal."* This is precisely that teaching.

The Vermilion Emperor: *Taboo name: Flame Cavern Cinnabar*
The Black Emperor: *Taboo name: Mysterious Clarity Sprouting*
The Yellow Emperor: *Taboo name: Hemp Loyalty Compliance*

These Five Emperors, as spoken of in the scriptures: the Azure Emperor guards the *hun*-soul and governs the liver; in heaven, he presides over flying immortals; on earth, he stabilizes the Five Peaks and commands ghosts and spirits; in humans, he governs the five viscera and leads the five spirits. The liver governs the *hun*-soul, the lungs the *po*-soul, the heart *qi*, the kidneys blood, and the spleen rules the central palace, governing the flesh. Thus, humans emulate earth, earth emulates heaven, heaven emulates the Dao, and the Dao emulates spontaneity. Opening the gate of extinction and salvation, teaching and learning the immortal origins—this is the model of the Primordial Pass, governing within the Jade Capital and Mysterious Metropolis, aligning with the scriptures to reach the Emperor’s presence.

**The Jade Emperor:** *Taboo name: Vast Splendor*
**The Heavenly Emperor of Supreme Clarity** (also called the Heavenly Emperor of Purple Dawn): *Taboo name: Jade Perfection, style: Tuo-yu*

This is the realm of formlessness, the heaven of Brahma-conduct, where the great Brahma *qi* flows and circulates, forming the diagram of primordial chaos. It naturally emits nine-colored radiance, not relying on the three luminaries’ illumination above. Thus, the scriptures say: *"The Heavenly Emperor of the Formless Realm, Brahma-conduct, Jade Perfection."* This refers to precisely this. Emerging from the numinous splendor of jade beauty as the origin of the Dao, it is marked by the Dragon Han and continues until the Red Clarity.

*Mohe* is the hidden title by which the heavens address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy.

The Thirty-Two Natural Renewal Merit Officials of the Three Heavens, the Thirty-Two Natural Memorial-Submitting Merit Officials of the Three Heavens, the Thirty-Two Natural Message-Transmitting Merit Officials of the Three Heavens, the Thirty-Two Natural Mysterious-Wondrous Merit Officials of the Three Heavens, and the Thirty-Two Natural Incense-Flying Merit Officials of the Three Heavens.

The Mysterious Master states: The Three-and-Five Merit Officials possess twofold numinous transformations, each governing a spiritual bureau. There are the Three Origins and Five Virtues Merit Officials, who are subordinate to the Great Clarity’s Cavern Spirits. These are the Three Heavens and Five August Lords’ Merit Officials, not born of womb-transformation or possessing form, but all spontaneously transformed from the true *qi* of the Three-and-Five. By the celestial true Dao-*qi*, they summon and register the correct *qi* of the Three Fields and Five Viscera within the body, fashioning them into numinous spirits. The Merit Officials are so named because they hold specific bureaus and duties.

The Left Attendant Envoys, thirty-two in number; the Right Attendant Envoys, thirty-two in number; the Incense-Bearing Golden Lads, thirty-two in number; and the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, thirty-two in number.

The Mysterious Master states: The Left and Right Attendant Envoys are the spirits of yin-yang communication, the first to act upon the Five Officials’ intentions. The Incense-Bearing Golden Lads embody the yang’s initial purity and clarity. The Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens embody the yin’s fundamental purity and reverence. The transmission of messages and flying incense conveys sincerity and reaches the truth—all are primordial perfected beings of the fourth rank.

The Mysterious Master states: These are also the true *qi* talismans of the Five Viscera, transformed by the *qi* harmonized with the Dao and virtue.

The Day-Directing Incense Officials, thirty-two in number.

The Mysterious Master states: The Day-Directing Incense Officials are assigned to the sixty days of the *jiazi* cycle, descendants of the Three Sovereigns. *Jiayin* and *Tianhuang* govern *jiachen*, the souls of the Six Fields, the parents of *jia*. Each day has thirty-two officials who direct the fragrant *qi*, dispersing filth and summoning the true—this is their efficacious duty. Their male and female forms are transformed from the *qi* of the Six *Jia*. Though the myriad spirits are not limited to thirty-two, only thirty-two are summoned for memorials, corresponding to the celestial numbers of the four directions.

Each heaven has two Three-and-Five Merit Officials, two Left and Right Attendant Envoys, one Incense-Bearing Golden Lad, one Message-Transmitting Jade Maiden, one Direct Talisman for each of the Five August Lords, and one Day-Directing Incense Official—twelve in total per heaven. The thirty-two heavens thus comprise three hundred and sixty in total. Each of these officials—two Merit Officials per one—refers to one for the Three Heavens and one for the Five August Lords, corresponding above to the twelve hundred Official Lords and below to the thirty-six thousand spirit-*qi*.

The Mysterious Master states: Within the Jade Clarity’s Numinous Void Palace and the Inner Court of the Heavenly Immortals of the Numinous Treasure, there are celestial bureaus that descend to serve the palace’s immortals, all summoned from above to descend.

The Grand Generals of Jade Clarity

The Mysterious Master said: Within Jade Clarity there are the Radiant Celestial Generals, mighty deities who assist the Dao, dispel demons, and descend upon command. The Numinous Officials of all heavens and passes, from the *xu* (11th earthly branch) to the *chen* (5th earthly branch), execute the斗诀 (Dipper Formula) to annihilate malevolent spirits of the ghostly and evil destinies; from *chen* to *xu*, they annihilate the Numinous Officials of hellish and evil destinies; from *kun* (southwest) to *gen* (northeast), they annihilate the Numinous Officials of the beastly and evil destinies; from *gen* to *kun*, they sever the Numinous Officials of the womb-root, the placenta-root, the knotted-root, the nodal-root, the desire-root, the six roots, and the earth-root. The Numinous Officials of the *chen* (5th branch) fly to transcend the household of color-karma; those of the *shen* (9th branch) fly to transcend the household of desire-karma; those of the *you* (10th branch) fly to transcend the household of love-karma; those of the *yin* (3rd branch) fly to transcend the household of emotion-karma; those of the *si* (6th branch) fly to transcend the household of greed-karma; and those of the *hai* (12th branch) are named the Numinous Officials of Supreme Mystery.

The Jade Clarity Divine Duke, Supreme Minister of the Supreme Mystery, of the sixth rank, together with the Jade Clarity Formula and the Purple Tenuity Seal, summons them. The Great Divine Azure Dragon of *zhen* (east), the Great Divine White Tiger of *dui* (west), the Great Divine Vermilion Bird of *li* (south), the Great Divine Dark Warrior of *kan* (north), the Great Divine Exorcising Deity of *kan* (north), the Great Divine Lion of *dui* (west), the Great Divine *Qiongqi* of *kun* (southwest), the Great Divine *Hailin* of *gen* (northeast), the Great Divine Heavenly Horse of *xun* (southeast), the Great Divine Vanguard of the *wu* (7th branch) Mighty Heavenly Guards, the Jade Clarity’s Folded-Hands Commanding Demon-Whip Banner Marshals, the Great Divine Generals of the *chen* (5th branch) Literary Star Pointing Jade Clarity’s Fire-Hurling, the Great Divine Generals of the *yin-li-wu-zhen* (3rd-9th-7th-3rd branches) Hand-Lifting Jade Clarity’s Flowing Bells, the *shen-kun-li* (9th-2nd-9th branches) Seven-Hurling Middle-Finger *chou-yin-mao* (2nd-3rd-4th branches).

The Great Divine Generals of the Front Beheading with Metal and Iron, the Jade Clarity Formula, the second finger directly pointing the Great Divine General of the Vast Queen Mother’s Punishment, the Jade Clarity’s Slaughtering Envoys with four fingers rooted and five fingers clenched, the Jade Clarity’s Wind-Fire Campaign Great Generals with the right hand in the Golden Lifting Formula, the left hand’s Four Mountains reaching *xun* (southeast) to lift high the beginning. The Great Deities Severing Ghostly Filth, the middle finger rooted at *gen* (northeast) lifting to inspect the ghostly camps, the *kun-li-xun-zhen* (southwest-9th-southeast-3rd branches) threading, the middle finger’s central *wen-chou* (civil-2nd branch) lifting. The Great Deities of the Golden Horse Post Route, from *wu* (7th branch) through the twelve earthly branches, returning from *li* (9th branch) to *wu* (7th branch) lifting.

The Record-Keepers of Jade Clarity list their names. The Three Clarities’ Formula of the middle finger, reaching the Five Directions, returns to the Jade Clarity Formula.

The Mysterious Master said: These Grand Generals and Mighty Deities of Jade Clarity all belong to the command of the Jade Clarity Divine Duke, Supreme Minister of the Supreme Mystery. Together with the Great Marshals of all heavens, their merit is equal to the loftiest numina, and they style themselves the Radiant Bureau of Jade Clarity’s Numinous Treasure, assisting Jade Clarity in kalpa transitions, demon-destruction, and disaster-sweeping, ascending and delivering the disciples of immortal study. They examine the Three Realms, drive out evil and malevolence, strictly govern the Northern Feng, control and command ghostly apparitions, search out ghostly encampments, and purify the Dao-qi, preparing for the seed-people of later generations to behold the Sagely Lord of Great Peace. They are all ministers of support and sweeping eradication.

Jade Clarity possesses the Heaven-Ascending Certificates, bestowed upon those who attain the Dao and ascend as immortals. When the Heavenly Worthy grants certificates to deliver suffering souls, they are sent to the Southern Palace. Without a certificate, the Heavenly Gate officials rebuke and bar their advance. Those who seek and obtain the certificate encounter no fettering obstructions at the Heavenly Gate.

Those who request the heavens to eradicate the Three Evils: internally, these are summoned by the Three Karmas; externally, they arise from the transgressions of the Three Poisons, leading to falls into the Three Evil Destinies of ghosts, beasts, and hells. Having today received deliverance from Jade Clarity, they follow their birthly *jia-yi* (1st-2nd celestial stems) to ascend and belong to the Thirty-Two Heavens. Through the master-disciple transmission across the passes, they request the eradication of the Three Evils. Internally, they eliminate the Three Karmas of body, speech, and mind; externally, they sever the Three Poisons of greed, anger, and delusion. Thus, hells have no means for their fall, ghosts have no means for their entry, and beasts have no means for their transformation.

Though delivered to eradicate the Three Evils internally and externally, if the karmic poisons of the Three Evils are not eliminated, they still cannot escape falling. In human birth, above are the twelve nodes, the roots of dead-qi transmitted by parents; in the middle are the twelve knots, the roots of dead-qi received by the body; below are the twelve placenta-knots, the roots of dead-qi transmitted to descendants—all are the earth-root. Therefore, on the day of deliverance, these must also be severed. Internally, the Thirty-Six Roots are eliminated; externally, the Six Roots’ evil destinies are restrained. The earth-root severed, debts are sealed, and forms are enclosed. Only then can one fly to transcend the Five Karmic Households of suffering, have one’s name listed in the Supreme Mystery, be supervised by the Demon Kings, and ascend through the Heavenly Gate. On this day of ascending Jade Clarity with flesh and bone together, the purpose of deliverance is fulfilled.

The Divine Dukes below receive the command of sweeping eradication. The Divine Duke is a minister of the Earthly Sovereign, heir of the Great Emperor of Horse Ancestors, and father of the Great Deity of the Dragon Horn *chen* (5th branch) constellation. His position is the Jade Clarity Divine Duke, Supreme Minister of the Supreme Mystery, styled the Horse-Dragon Clan, with the personal name Kuo Yi.

The *Scripture of the Infinite Salvation of Humanity, Supreme Method of the Numinous Treasure*, Scroll Twenty-Nine, concludes.
The *Scripture of the Infinite Salvation of Humanity, Supreme Method of the Numinous Treasure*, Scroll Thirty: **Rituals of Exorcism and Salvation**

The Master says: When the cycles of Heaven and Earth are in disorder, one must inscribe the texts of the Dragon Script and Phoenix *Qi* upon plain silk, place them upon purple net, and install them in renowned mountains, reciting this scripture to exorcise the affliction.

If the stellar lodges fall into disarray and the sun and moon lose their proper course, inscribe in cinnabar upon yellow silk the Red Script of the Five Elders and the Jade Characters of the True Writ, install them in renowned mountains, and recite to exorcise.

If the four seasons fall into disorder and yin and yang fail to harmonize, inscribe in cinnabar upon green silk the chapters of the Great Brahma’s Correct Sounds, place them in village shrines, temples, or renowned mountains, and recite to exorcise.

If the sovereign of the state encounters calamity and warfare arises on all sides, inscribe in cinnabar upon yellow silk the secret names of the Thirty-Two Heavens, wear them upon the body, and recite to exorcise.

If pestilence spreads and the people suffer death and injury, inscribe in cinnabar upon green silk the Correct Sounds of the Thirty-Two Heavens, wear them upon the body, and recite to exorcise.

If the lives of masters or companions come to an end, inscribe in cinnabar upon yellow silk the Great Brahma’s Hidden Speech and the Infinite Sounds, and burn them to deliver the deceased.

In all ritual applications, visualize oneself as the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, press the middle joint of the middle finger, draw in the three *qi* of the Heavenly Gate, and inscribe while facing south.

If one follows the ritual protocols, fasts, recites with utmost sincerity, inscribes talismans, and chants, then the names shall be recorded by the myriad heavens, the ten thousand spirits shall attend as guards, and one shall become a minister of the Golden Towers, with the Demon Kings as guarantors.

For the four directions—east, west, south, and north—inscribe in vermilion on blue-green paper; for the center, use yellow paper. Carve the text on stones corresponding to the directional colors; this is also permissible.

All celestial stars and lodgings possess their allotted degrees. When their paths cross or transgress, encroaching upon one another, or when anomalous stars appear within a directional domain, it arises from the obstruction or agitation of the celestial *qi*’s revolutions, portending disasters that afflict their assigned lands. Thus, the turning illumination of Heaven’s light manifests, issuing dark omens of inauspiciousness.

Therefore, the Primordial Beginning bestowed these writs to harmonize Heaven and pacify Earth, to dissolve disasters and avert misfortunes, to secure the state and tranquilize the people. When adepts of utmost sincerity practice this method in accordance with the Dharma, on the day a disaster manifests, they shall inscribe the true writ, expose it in the open courtyard facing the afflicted direction, and perform twelve knockings of the teeth. Disheveling their hair and gazing upward, they shall pray:

*"Primordial Beginning of the Upper Heavens,
The Three Luminaries shine on high.
Revolving radiance illumines,
The four directions gleam in clarity.
Where the revolutions clash,
Meteors surge and stream.
The five realms transgress,
The three currents lose their peace.
The Five Dippers command the dawn,
The Seven Lodgings’ numinous brightness.
True Lord, Great Handle,
Whose tabooed name is Jade Essence.
The Empress of Humankind,
Whose name is Nurturing Infant.
Commanding the Mysterious Pass,
Revolving all Heavens.
Now a visiting calamity
Issues dark omens of inauspiciousness.
With reverence, we present the true writ,
The Scarlet Writ offered on high.
Disheveled, we confess our transgressions,
Baring our crimson sincerity.
May You deign to gaze with mysterious insight,
Restore the celestial canon.
Let *qi* not transgress its bounds,
Let disasters not arise wantonly.
Burn the numinous writ,
Dissipate its smoke in the Jade Court.
The Upper Radiance surveys in brightness,
Proclaiming to all numinous beings.
*Qi* dissolves the Three Passes,
Disasters vanish in the Nine Seas.
Yin and Yang harmonize,
The land enjoys great peace."*

Having recited the incantation, expose the true writ in the courtyard, placing it according to the afflicted direction, and anchor it with a golden dragon. If the calamity lies in the east, after nine days and nine nights, burn the writ and scatter its ashes amid the blue-green smoke.

For all methods of averting celestial disasters to secure the state and tranquilize the people, light lamps corresponding to the afflicted direction to illumine the various Heavens. If the calamity lies in the east, light nine lamps—or ninety, or nine hundred—using a golden dragon and ninety *chi* of blue-green silk for nine days and nine nights. If the calamity lies in the south, light three lamps—or thirty, or three hundred—with thirty *chi* of crimson silk for three days and three nights. If the calamity lies in the center, light twelve lamps—or one hundred twenty, or one thousand two hundred—with one hundred twenty *chi* of yellow silk for twelve days and twelve nights. If the calamity lies in the west, light seven lamps—or seventy, or seven hundred—with seven *chi* of white silk for seven days and seven nights. If the calamity lies in the north, light five lamps—or fifty, or five hundred—with fifty *chi* of black silk for five days and five nights.

This is the Upper Primordial Dharma of the Numinous Treasure.

Within the Dark Heaven of the North, where threefold qi swirls in lingering cycles, dwells the Black Thearch of the Twin August Ones. The Great Tenuity governs the tallying of mandates and the refinement of immortals, wielding the Eight Might, clad in azure skirts and feathered capes adorned with dragon patterns and phoenix robes—those whom the Supreme Thearch exalts and appoints to rectify the celestial ranks.

Inscribe in white upon slips of the corresponding directional color, recording name and date as when submitting a memorial. Then, after nine years, the Five Directional Immortal Officials shall arrive as envoys, accompanied by Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist, Vermilion Mound, Yellow Simplicity, Grand Simplicity, and Grand Mystery, all manifesting. Strike the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:

*"Lofty numen of the Dark Above, revered spirit of the Primordial Beginning.
Great Sage who lingers in cycles, myriad perfected descend to the celestial terrace.
Three luminaries spread their radiance, auspicious clouds arrayed on four sides.
Supreme registers are examined, ranks weighed across the Nine Heavens.
Today I make my vow, submitting my slip to the numinous mountain.
Cinnabar peaks and vermilion script, spontaneous true writ.
I report to the Five Thearchs, inscribing my name in the jade tablets.
Myriad spirits bear witness, sun and moon seal the covenant.
Grant passage, grant life, grant spirit, grant immortality.
Heaven and earth, stars and constellations, mutually illumine my body.
Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, Five Thearchs and Great Spirits,
universally proclaim without end, erasing the roots of transgression.
The Primordial Beginning opens wide, none shall reject this plea.
Nine generations of ancestral souls receive blessings naturally.
Three Paths and Five Sufferings, forever parted from the Eight Perils.
Attaining the Three Luminaries, together shining in the Purple Court.
Revolving without cessation, the body ascends as a flying immortal."*

Upon completing the incantation, cast the slip from the summit of a sheer cliff or renowned mountain, scatter flowers upon the numinous peak, strike the teeth thrice more, face the direction of one’s life-star, and recite again:

*"The Primordial Beginning bears witness, the immortal name is inscribed.
Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, no transgression remains unabsolved.
Scatter flowers to the Five Thearchs, pledge the covenant to the Great Void.
As petitioned, may I dwell for ten thousand kalpas."*

Face the northeast, strike the teeth nine times to the east, three times to the south, twelve times to the center, seven times to the west, and five times to the north. For each direction, perform thirty-six knocks of the teeth, hold the breath for nine exhalations, then raise the head and recite the incantation:

*"The Three Origins unfold in clarity, revolving the celestial constancy.
As the reckoning cycles to its end, the hundred-six traverse the ridge.
At the great kalpa’s convergence, ten thousand specters vie in motion.
The Northern Capital knows no restraint, unleashing the ghostly legions.
Hordes of demons run rampant, obscuring the light of heaven.
The Supreme Thearch issues his command, proclaiming it to the ten directions.
The celestial measures are expounded, the Dharma’s teachings unfurl.

The Three Officials of the Northern Capital, swiftly transmit and execute.
A thousand demons bound in submission, ten thousand ghosts dispatched in form.
The clanging bells resplendent, the yang qi stirred to radiance.
The Golden Tigers patrol the four quarters, the Heavenly Soldiers assist in annihilation.
Great and small, all must arrive—none may conceal or hide.
As the Primordial Beginning decrees, so shall it be memorialized to the Supreme Void."*

The Vermilion Script for Halting Floods and Delivering from Water Disasters

**East:**
Descend to govern the Eastern River and the vast sea.
The water deities of the great kalpic flood,
dragons bearing their forms—
open the water palaces, clear the paths and thoroughfares by the hundreds and thousands.
The Thearch’s Crimson Writ, unceasing as wind and fire,
*Yellow Script upon Azure Ground.*

**South:**
The Southern River’s Water Thearch, Great Elder Dragon King,
his divine incantations circulating, universally sweeping away inauspiciousness.
Flying flood disasters halted,
dragons summoned, waterways opened and cleared—
a thousand paths, ten thousand passages made free.
Who dares transgress shall be seized and dispatched to the Fire Palace.
*Crimson Writ, as proclaimed—none may disobey.*
*Yellow Script upon Azure Ground.*

**Center:**
The Central Mountain’s divine incantations summon dragons to ascend the clouds,
commanding the confluence of the Yellow River and the nine waters.
The river’s sources must not slacken or indulge—
good and evil shall be wholly distinguished.
A thousand demons, ten thousand villains,
all shall answer before the Thearch-Lord.
Who dares transgress shall be scorched by the blazing yang,
the Vermilion Script’s jade characters proclaimed for all to hear.
*Yellow Script upon Azure Ground.*

**West:**

**West:**
The Western Mountain’s divine incantations,
eightfold majesty, sevenfold transmission—
talismanic waters ascend,
dragons summoned, mountains sent,
clouds stationed where commanded.
Once aligned, all shall bear fruit in unison,
arriving together at the Thearch’s gate,
aiding and guarding the perfected ones,
severing and extinguishing the roots of evil.
Should any inauspiciousness arise,
seal it with the Golden Pass.
The Crimson Writ’s talismanic decree
shall be borne by wind and fire, relayed in haste.
*Yellow Script upon Azure Ground.*

**North:**
The nine rivers pour forth in completion,
the Raven Mother’s flock takes flight,
shark-dragons clear the paths,
waterways open, caverns unsealed.
The Vermilion Text’s jade script
is borne by courier-dragons, wind-driven in swift succession.
*Yellow Script upon Azure Ground.*

The Dao declares:
When the great cataclysm of Heaven and Earth befalls,
floodwaters surge from all four quarters,
scouring filth and eradicating evil—
not a single trace shall remain.
At such a time, Heaven and Earth merge in darkness,
the people drift adrift,
no longer distinguished as good or evil.
Only those of utmost learning,
who obtain the *Lingbao* true writ
and the talismans of great and minor kalpas,
may ride the soaring plumes to gaze from on high,
ascend the sacred peaks and drift upon the void.
In that hour, the spirits shall dispatch the shark-dragons
to open waterways and clear passages for safe passage,
while the River Earls govern the crossings,
no longer awaiting bridges or ferries.
Thus is the marvel of the numinous writ revealed—
how could it be bound by the juncture of the great kalpa?

When such a moment arrives,
follow the ancient writ’s instructions:
face north, click the teeth five times,
hold the breath for twenty-five cycles.
Visualize a great fire arising from your heart and mind,
emerging from the crown of your head to burn the mountains,
forests, grasses, and trees in the four directions,
until your body is wholly consumed,
your form reduced to ashes,
all at once soaring into the azure mist,
leaving nothing behind.
Envision the vast waters surging to purge the world,
yourself transformed into a shark-dragon,
flowing with the current.

Then click the teeth twenty-five times again,
and raise your voice in prayer:
*"The Supreme Origin revolves its numen,
illuminating the Nine Primordials.
Heaven turns, Earth shifts,
the Three Qi circulate in transmission.
The Five Phases press onward,
the pivot of destiny set in motion.
Yin and yang clash in opposition,
forging calamity’s collision.
The great kalpa’s upheaval concludes,
scouring away demonic vapors.
The nine rivers receive their reckoning,
torrential floods surge through the streams.
The Water Mother lingers,
the ravens gather in flocks.
Sun and moon conjoin in darkness,
the Three Luminaries halt their course.
The gods on high are chosen,
the jade writs examined and enforced.
Evil is cast aside, goodness exalted,
the pure and turbid forever divided.
I am inscribed in the Thearch’s register,
my name recorded in the Nine Heavens.
At the convergence of the four great disasters,
the Crimson Writ absolves all.
This day’s decree is proclaimed,
all spirits hear it in unison.
Sun, moon, and five stars
illumine my soul.
The sacred peaks of the Five Marchmounts
float and ferry my body.
The Water Palace of the Nine Rivers,
the vast numinous spirits—
open the deep waterways,
clear the river crossings.
Shark-dragons respond to the talisman,
bearing mountains and sending clouds.
Carry me, convey me,
racing in startled haste through the four quarters.
The cinnabar script’s vermilion characters,
the Yuan Shi’s true writ—
presented by golden dragon couriers,
unceasing in their swift relay.
Instantly submitted for the Thearch’s review,
to stand before the Thearch-Lord."*

Conclude by swallowing the breath twenty-five times.
In but a moment,
the water spirits shall open the path
to ferry your body across.
On mountains, the peaks shall float;
in waters, the currents shall part.
This is the very instant of deliverance from peril—
the moment of reverent salvation.

*The Great Method of the Numinous Treasure’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity, Upper Scripture.*

The Master says: According to the ancient texts of the vermilion-script *Jade Formula* and *True Writ* incantations, later scholars found them difficult to practice. Thus did the Most High take up the brush to resolve the obscurities of the *Jade Formula*’s essentials, expounding upon the ancient texts’ subtle and wondrous primordial words. The exalted ones of the myriad heavens, reciting the jade sounds, chant in unison across the ten directions. Above, heaven establishes rites; gods and demons submit, and thus are the world’s scriptural Daoist methods taught.

Yet when these are transmitted through old texts, many errors arise. Moreover, what is commonly possessed is deemed base, while what is rarely obtained is prized as treasure. Worldly custom values rarity and esteems the same, drowning in prior perceptions. Thus do texts often prize what was first obtained. Worldly custom values the unusual, again deeming what is hard to obtain as marvelous, while what is easily obtained is dismissed as worthless.

Thus do worldly masters who grasp the marvels of these methods often withhold them from others. Blind masters misinterpret and each erect their own doctrines, startling later generations. Now, having carefully examined and verified these with the alchemical chambers’ concordances, I have distilled them to essentials—true principles and orthodox teachings without doubt, and thus is it well.

**The Chapter of the Great Brahmā’s True Sounds**
The Master says: The *Chapter of the Great Brahmā’s True Sounds* is formed from the primordial qi of the *Spontaneous Flying Wheel* of the Original Beginning. Those who recite it may subdue the myriad spirits and transcend the Five Sufferings. Adept practitioners of the great methods, on a *bing*-day of the sixth celestial stem, facing east and writing in cinnabar upon yellow silk, may wear it upon their person to dispel and restrain all demons and dissolve the myriad calamities. One must visualize the *Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy*, press the upper joint of the middle finger, draw the primordial qi of the Original Beginning, and infuse the brush to write. When writing the chapter, recite the incantation:

*Original Beginning, Ancestral Wheel,*
*Weaving Brahmā’s net.*
*Spontaneous, numinous, wondrous,*
*Original Beginning without end.*
*Profound and boundless, the Dao’s vast plan,*
*Lifting and expanding its majesty.*
*Mysterious clarity, distant and deep,*
*True spirit, numinous peak.*
*The Dao’s reach, the totality’s chief,*
*Surpassing all bounds without limit.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the* Numinous Treasure’s *foremost decree!*

**The Great Brahmā’s True Sounds**
Vast life, lofty radiance,
Awakening the primordial, penetrating the void.
Responding to the Nine Perfected of the Original,
Transformations interweave, the pattern begins.
The movement of numinous script constructs,
The ancestral model of the primordial capital.
Resonance and response are wholly embraced,
Majesty shines forth of itself.
Green peaks shift the light,
The imperial Dao contains brightness.
The celestial forest glows with authority,
Qi’s essence nurtures the soul.
Fusion and net stand firm,
The perfect flower conceals its brilliance.
The appointed great spirit envelops,
The grand network proclaims tranquility.
The chapter’s flame spreads widely,
Firmly unfolding, clarifying the lineage.
The empty image, the mysterious blossom,
The dragon’s yang dances the vault.
Subtle rectitude, dawn’s splendor,
The profound and great congeal in harmony.
The primordial gate’s triple bond,
The Great Brahmā soars in flight.
Hidden awakening, exalted benefit,
Heavenly order celebrates its manifestation.
The spirit’s gate entwines,
True qi scatters its essence.
Floating grasp, bright illumination,
Revolving, uniting, ascending.
Guiding the soaring, feasting in clouds,
Numinous response ascends to heaven.
Firm brilliance, subtle control,
Yin’s stern solitary majesty.
Piercing qi, dark and plain,
The imperial cavern opens the subtle.
Encompassing transformation, obscure response,
Clarifying radiance upon the imperial terrace.
Leveling the distant, drawing the void,
Expanding the flourishing child’s pool.
Binding the whirlwind, descending to nurture,
Splendor unscattered, unbound.
Yang’s passage through the hundred and six,
Moreover, the awn’s hidden steps.
Profound vastness, dark silence,
The true peak gathers the numinous.
Firm and grand, following the Dao,
Proclaiming the mandate to the soaring forest.
The dragon’s peace, the cavern’s change,
Pure yang conceals the mysterious.
The square root returns to qi,
The image submits, loftily bearing.
Spirit’s transformation, gracious and just,
Refining and tempering the numinous root.
Crimson essence, pure Dao,
Becoming the titled, majestic and revered.
Beneficial clouds, constant in presence,
A hundred thousand fathoms, the central mound.
Luxuriant city, jade ramparts,
Melodious sounds flow in celebration.
Receiving position in the jade chamber,
The great statute penetrates the obscure.
The mysterious chapter shines and scatters,
The network’s wheel thus completes its cycle.

**The Great Brahmā’s Immeasurable Hidden Sounds**
The Master says: The *Great Brahmā* is the heaven within heavens. *Hidden sounds* are the secret tones of the myriad heavens. These were received by the *Most High Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord* from the *Original Beginning Heavenly Worthy* as esoteric instructions, the subtleties of cultivation. Thus, following the sixty-four hexagrams, he composed its phrases to correspond to the number of the *Central Yellow*. All who refine the elixir must choose a day when fire flourishes in *bing* or *ding*, face southeast, set up an altar, bow twice, and write upon yellow silk. Wearing it as a talisman will cause the myriad spirits to tremble in submission, summoning and assembling the true qi to knock upon the gates of the Three Fields. If written in cinnabar on green paper, it may deliver the souls of the deceased above and below, so that their bodies enter radiance and do not dwell in layered darkness—this is what is called the *Great Brahmā’s Immeasurable Sounds*.

**The Eight Heavens of the East**

**The Upper Scripture of the Limitless Salvation of the Numinous Treasure, Great Rites, Scroll Thirty-Two (Conclusion)**

**The Upper Scripture of the Limitless Salvation of the Numinous Treasure, Great Rites, Scroll Thirty-Three**
**Methods for Expiation and Ritual Regulations**

The Mystic Master said: When the four seasons lose their measure, yin and yang fall out of harmony, the stellar lodges deviate from their paths, the sun and moon lose their proper times, the sovereign faces calamity, warfare erupts on all sides, pestilence spreads, and the people suffer death and injury—even when masters and companions pass beyond, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures.

For establishing the ritual altar of the Numinous Treasure: gather pure scholars of like mind, draw clear spring water from the nine directions, store it in vessels of gold and jade, inscribe the names of the nine wilds in ink and bury them in the forms of the Three Mornings, cover them with a canopy and perform empowerment. Observe the waxing and waning of disasters. Prepare offerings beloved by the divine spirits, present the nine sacred hymns they cherish, and align the heart’s cinnabar with Heaven. Only then will the nine merits be accomplished, and ascension attained. If the secrets are leaked or known to outsiders, the merit will not be recorded.

The oral instructions state: When the four seasons lose their measure, such as spring following autumn’s commands or summer following winter’s. When yin and yang fall out of harmony, such as untimely rain or scorching drought. In all such cases, one must perform purification rites, recite scriptures, and burn incense in the six periods.

When the stellar lodges deviate from their paths, such as the five planets trespassing, the nine luminaries straying from their courses, ominous comets appearing in the wilds, or strange qi and anomalies arising. When the sun and moon lose their proper times, such as eclipses, halos, rainbows, or obscuring mists and darkened skies—all are deemed "losing their proper times."

When the sovereign faces calamity, such as treacherous ministers or rebels usurping power, coercing the royal mandate, or governing with discord and misrule. When warfare erupts on all sides, such as the eight directions remaining untransformed, barbarian tribes invading the borders, rebel armies and traitorous ministers waging unjust wars, or fortresses crushing the wilds, with men wailing and women grieving, all mutually oppressing and harming one another.

When pestilence spreads, such as seasonal plagues ravaging cities and towns, or malevolent beasts and poisonous creatures causing bewilderment and harm. When the people suffer death and injury, such as afflictions of wind, consumption, or cold qi, ghostly and demonic incursions, mountains collapsing and earth splitting, fire and water clashing, or rivers, seas, mountains, and streams spawning malevolent creatures that bring disaster, or wild paths harboring venomous spirits and demonic beings that invade and oppress, spreading and lingering to cause mass death and injury.

When masters and companions pass beyond: those of like learning are as close as kin, and even a single good deed may be studied and taken as a teacher. For the nine kinds of yin merits, the grandest is the Mystic Altar of the Numinous Treasure, while the lesser is the establishment of a small altar for the Three Mornings. If masters or companions face mortal peril, one should measure the circumstances and recite the appropriate scriptures, following the rites of ascension and deliverance.

**Regulations for the Mystic Altar of the Numinous Treasure**
Select a site where the qi of life flows, free from filth, pollution, or stony ground, and not on battlefields, execution grounds, slaughterhouses, or birthing places. Construct a three-tiered altar.

Write the cauldron’s name in vermilion on the outside of the vessel and the province’s name in black on the inside. On the middle tier’s eight directions, write the *Hetu* patterns in vermilion. Place the vessels with the cauldron’s name facing outward, ensuring they are stable and not tilted.

**The Hetu**
Method for Verifying Disasters, Blessings, Calamities, and Fortuitous Meetings in the Vessels.

When black and turbid waters bring disaster, black and murky rains cause flooding; when yellow and turbid winds bring calamity, yellow and murky airs bring pestilence; when yellow and foul qi bring insect plagues, and characters appear on the ground, earthquakes occur. White and turbid characters foretell minor raids, white and murky characters signify the annihilation of armies. Water depletion leads to drought, while red and crimson characters in water foretell freshwater disasters. Green and murky airs herald famine.

Should unlawful changes arise, promptly report them to the Celestial Bureau for verification and resolution. If all remains ordinary, the province will enjoy peace.

**Nine Palaces and Eight Nodal Days Method for Dispelling Disasters**
The Mysterious Master said: The Southern Supreme Palace, governed by Han, holds the nine celestial stars of the Nine Palaces, which descend to the nine terrestrial regions, executing Heaven’s mandate to oversee calamities and anomalies.

Each nodal day governs the stabilization of qi; each year governs its division; every hundred days governs inspection; and each day enacts transformative decrees.

- **Kan Palace (North):** The deity of the Dark Abyss, the Great Unity Star, presides over warfare, floods, riverbank breaches, grain scarcity, and military strife.
- **Li Palace (South):** The deity of Vermilion Flame, the Celestial Unity Star, governs severe droughts, withered grass, scorching fires, parched grain, and famine.
- **Central Palace:** The deity of Profound Transformation, the Celestial Talisman Star, oversees harmful terrestrial qi, fissures in the earth, construction disasters, earthquakes, epidemics, and civilian hardship.
- **Qian Palace (Northwest):** The deity of Flying Clouds, the Azure Dragon Star, governs frost, cold, floods, fires, and warfare.
- **Gen Palace (Northeast):** The deity of Accumulated Yin, the Supreme Yin Star, presides over gloom, dense fog, and the dimming of sun and moon.
- **Zhen Palace (East):** The deity of the Azure Dragon, the Xuanyuan Star, governs violent thunder, fierce winds, torrential rains, military encampments, epidemics, and heavy frost.
- **Xun Palace (Southeast):** The deity of Ethereal Mist, the Zhao Yao Star, oversees sudden storms, hail, damaging rains, crop destruction, and locust plagues.
- **Kun Palace (Southwest):** The deity of Primordial Earth, the Sheti Star, governs construction disasters, sudden cold, frost, dense fog, and the destruction of vegetation.
- **Dui Palace (West):** The deity of Metallic Splendor, the Xianchi Star, presides over frost, cold, grain damage, destruction, warfare, banditry, and violent rebels.

For these nine years, under the mandate of the Southern Supreme Palace, each deity governs one nodal period, commanding calamities and anomalies. They traverse the nine lands, establishing restraining palaces, yet when the four seasons lose their balance and yin-yang falls into disharmony, the Three Pure Ones’ long-officials and the Great Unity Divine Lord specifically oversee warfare, droughts, floods, and pestilential plagues.

Moreover, the Purple Tenuity’s Supreme Palace, the Celestial Sovereign’s Mysterious Mansion, and the Azure Net Perfected govern the kalpas’ limits, the reckoning of the Seven Governors, the regulation of the Lower Kalpa, civilian disasters, national crises, solar and lunar eclipses, planetary deviations, orbital misalignments, celestial fissures, earthquakes, ominous comets, baleful stars, and anomalous qi—also presiding over the nine lands’ fortunes and misfortunes.

For each of the eight nodal days, beginning with the Winter Solstice, first face east and recite the scripture ten times to dispel the disasters of the nine lands from the Winter Solstice to the Beginning of Spring (forty-five days). Starting from the Kan Palace, face north and recite one cycle through the Nine Palaces. After nine cycles, face east and recite one more cycle to dispel the disasters of the Kan Palace’s northern region.

For the Beginning of Spring nodal day, first face east and recite the scripture ten times to dispel the forty-five days’ disasters following the Beginning of Spring. Begin at the Gen Palace, proceeding through the seven palaces to the Dui Palace, completing nine recitations, then face east for the tenth recitation.

Follow the Nine Palaces diagram: on each of the eight nodal days, recite the scripture ten times. Upon completion, invoke the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens attendant upon the scripture, entrusting them with its intent. For each land, as in the Primordial Beginning’s dual recitation of the scripture’s blessings, visualize the salvation of all beings, beginning with the Azure Realm. With each thought, concentrate and visualize.

**Diagram of the Eight Nodal Days and Nine Palaces**
The Mysterious Master said: All fortunes and misfortunes of the nine lands are predetermined by the Supreme Emperor during the Grand Assembly of the Lower Kalpa on the fifteenth day of the tenth month. By the Winter Solstice of the eleventh month, the yang qi responds to these fortunes and misfortunes, rising and receding in accordance with their destined numbers. For those not bound by fate, disasters manifest after the first day of the first month, yet only when the days and months have run their course do misfortunes arise—unknown to the common world.

Those who hold the office of Cavernous Mystery Immortals do not wait for calamities to strike before dispelling them. After the Lower Kalpa on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, they perform meritorious deeds to save the world and aid the nation and its people. Select nine fellow practitioners, establish a Three Heavens’ Qi-Convergence Altar, with the upper tier modeling Heaven, the middle tier symbolizing humanity, and the lower tier embodying Earth, arranging positions according to the three tiers.

On the upper tier’s east and west, fashion the sun and moon from gold, jade, silver, or bronze—circular in shape, the sun nine fen in diameter, the moon ten fen—placing them at the mao and you positions at the altar’s edge. Next, craft the Five Stars from five types of quartz, each the size of a pellet, and bury them according to the five directions, three cun within the upper tier’s field and moon boundary, one cun deep, at the altar’s center.

Erect a soaring pillar, three chi and two cun tall, with three tiers, each eight cun apart, and a fourth lower tier supporting the Dipper’s handle like a carpenter’s square lamp stand. Paint the upper tier’s perimeter with azure-colored clay, resembling pale jade, and inscribe the Twenty-Eight Constellations’ handle shapes in cinnabar.

On the middle tier, apply yellow-colored clay, extending it around the perimeter, and inscribe the Five Numinous Treasures’ talismans, the Four Corners, and the Four Paths. Next, inscribe the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Great Brahma Cloud Seal and the Luminous Jade Characters of Light, evenly distributed across the middle tier’s four corners. Also inscribe the names of the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors below.

Prepare nine vessels of precious material or pristine, unglazed pottery, placing them at the altar’s nine directions. Draw water from deep, long-flowing springs, filling the central vessel and positioning it in the kun direction.

Before filling the vessels, nine ritual masters face the nine directions, holding brushes. Visualize the vast expanse of the ten thousand li, with its people, mountains, rivers, cities, and towns. Draw in qi and blow it onto the brushes, placing them at the nine directions. According to the palace divisions and qi numbers, concentrate and visualize. For example, when facing the southern palace, draw qi nine times and blow it onto the brush, then inscribe the nine provinces’ names in black within the vessels.

Boil the nine directions’ waters, pour them into the vessels until level, cover them, place lamps beside them, and set incense before them. Erect a placard behind each vessel, inscribed according to the method.

The lower tier is adorned with white-colored clay. Eight gates are opened at the sides of the altar, with two pathways inscribed with the Eight Trigrams. The Four Seas and Five Peaks are drawn, the Central Peak positioned in the kun palace. The nine provinces’ geographical divisions are arranged according to the prescribed pattern. Once the altar is fully prepared, the sacred ranks are set in three tiers.

Only after all is complete does one enter the altar at the zi hour. Tables and mats are laid out in the eight directions, and eight like-minded practitioners, each overseeing one direction, take their places. The grand master ascends the high seat at the *Earth Gate*, facing the *Heavenly Gate* to preside over the central five palaces.

Once the positions are established, incense is offered in the six daily periods. Each practitioner recites the *Great Scripture of Numinous Treasure* once, then all chant it in unison, completing ten full cycles. Each also inwardly visualizes the methods of the *Internal Work Scripture*, applying intention to the practice. After a full day and night of six periods, at the hai hour, one enters the altar to inspect the vessels, observing the nine lands’ calamities in detail.

The ritual is repeated as before, and at the next hai hour, the vessels are examined again. If the water and inscriptions within remain unchanged, the altar is closed, and a jiao offering is held to express gratitude.

This method is employed for dispelling calamities, delivering souls, and all prayers of thanksgiving.

The Mysterious Master states: This is the *Great Crimson Golden Rites*. Do not presume to alter it with private interpretations, lest the prescribed forms be lost, the resonance fail to manifest, and all efforts prove futile.

**The Five Emperors’ Nurturance of All Things**

The Mysterious Master said: When mists thicken and vapors disperse, cold and heat lose their season; when Heaven and Earth fail in their embrace, locusts and pests multiply, devouring the hundred grains; when plagues and pestilence strike in concert, harming and slaying the common folk; when summer frosts and winter thunder arise, autumn blossoms bloom in spring, and spring’s commands go unfulfilled; when rainbows span the sky, great hail and bitter rains fall, fierce winds and swift thunder damage all things; when dragons and sea-monsters emerge from the void, tigers and rhinos roam the land, long serpents and swarming rats appear, and demonic curses and malevolent hexes spread—then one must pray to the Fire Bureau to rectify the seasons and invoke the Five Emperors to nurture all things.

The Western Marchmount governs venomous creatures and gathers locusts, eastern serpents, and tigers. The August Heaven dispels pestilence and preserves life. The Celestial Officials cure epidemics and relieve suffering. Jade writs suppress rampant dragons; golden scripts dissolve curses and hexes. Without the highest-grade methods, divine efficacy cannot be aided. Borrowing the middle scroll to amplify power, one may swiftly ascend and roam as a spirit, receiving grace and blessings from the Mysterious Ancestor.

The formula states: The Primordial Dao Ancestor divided and descended to transform all kinds. The qi of the Three Primes gave rise to the lofty perfected; the upright qi of the Five Phases became the hundred spirits. The fierce qi of the Dipper’s might transformed into the Six Jia; the gentle qi of harmony became the Six Ding. The balanced qi of equilibrium gave form to the common folk; the utmost yin qi became ghostly essences. The qi of miscellaneous kinds became birds and beasts; the faint and disordered qi became insects.

In the measures of the four seasons, the Five Emperors nurture all things. In spring, the Green Emperor governs with harmonious qi; by the fourth month, the Red Emperor takes command, shifting harmony into warmth. If the Green Emperor fails to withdraw spring’s mandate, then weak cold lingers, and the five grains and hundred fruits fail to ripen, while mist-borne plagues arise. If the Red Emperor encroaches upon his rule, swift thunder and fierce winds arise, water demons wreak havoc, harming the myriad things, and the people suffer from heat-borne plagues, paralysis, scabies, and toxic dysentery.

In summer, the Red Emperor governs with the fire mandate, ripening the myriad things; by the seventh month, the White Emperor takes command, transforming warmth into coolness. If the Red Emperor fails to withdraw summer’s mandate, then scorching yang dries the waters, rainbows, hail, and lightning bring bitter rains and fierce winds, damaging grasses and trees, while venomous serpents and evil creatures emerge in the mountains and wilds. If the White Emperor encroaches upon his rule, then summer frosts and mists appear, grasses and trees wither and die, the hundred grains fail to ripen, and the people suffer from malaria and coughs.

In autumn, the White Emperor governs with the autumn mandate, bringing the five grains to fruition and the myriad things to harvest; by the tenth month, the Black Emperor takes command, shifting coolness into wind. If the White Emperor fails to withdraw autumn’s mandate, then autumn blossoms bloom, tigers and leopards wreak havoc, rats devour the five grains, and the people suffer from sores and ulcers. If the Black Emperor encroaches upon his rule, then mountains and rivers overflow, coasts and lands quake, the hundred grains fail to mature, birds and beasts die of themselves, and the earth’s vitality withers, bringing famine and disease in concert.

In winter, the Black Emperor governs with the cold mandate; if by the first month the Green Emperor fails to take command, then rain and insects break trees, the old and young perish suddenly, and the people suffer great plagues in spring. If the Green Emperor encroaches upon his rule, then the hundred flowers bloom prematurely, bearing blossoms without fruit, waters bring forth dragons and sea-monsters, and the people suffer sudden death.

Moreover, the four seasons and their four qi are assisted by the virtue of Earth. If water exceeds its measure, then yin and yang fall out of balance, and the hundred disasters and myriad harms arise accordingly. All these are subject to the Southern Florescence Emperor, Han, Controller of the Fire Bureau. The Venerable Lord Han presides over it, styled "The Permissible Han," governing under the Five Emperors to nurture all things, rectify the celestial lodges, regulate the turning jade armillary, and align the Seven Regulators.

For all such disasters, one must petition the Venerable Lord, report to the Five Emperors, and command the locusts, tigers, and rhinos, all of which are governed by the Lord of the Western Marchmount. Pestilence and plague belong to the Eastern Culmen Azure Mystery Supreme Clarity Jade Bureau of Life Preservation, overseen by the Great Unity Primordial Life Bureau and the Four Marshals’ Court of the Heavenly Wings. Jade writs and golden scripts are issued separately. Yet all require the middle scroll, ten thousand recitations of the highest-grade scripture, and ten deliverances of people—only then can calamities be healed across the four quarters and demonic afflictions expelled from the eight directions. Accumulating this mysterious merit does not bless the self alone but extends felicity to the Mysterious Ancestor.

**The Five Emperors’ True Talismans for Nurturing All Things**

The Numinous Treasure possesses the Five Emperors’ True Talismans for Nurturing All Things, which are the Dao of the middle-grade deliverance of the Numinous Treasure, governed by the Five Emperors of the Five Directions and the creative functions of the Five Phases. For all adepts who cultivate and employ these five talismans, first wear the Five Emperors’ True Punishment Talismans, visualize the Five Emperors’ attendants, and see the Five Stars dwelling in the empty mystery, each five feet from the practitioner’s face: the Wood Star with nine rays of azure light, the Sparkling Deluder with three rays of red light, the Grand White with seven rays of white light, the Chronographic Star with five rays of black light, and the Earth Star with twelve rays of yellow radiance.

Then, offer incense to the five directions. Face east, bow nine times, and knock the teeth nine times. Hold the breath nine times, form the Jade Clarity mudra, and draw in the east’s qi to blow upon the talisman. Next, face south, bow three times, knock the teeth three times, hold the breath three times, and inscribe the Red Emperor’s talisman. Form the Jade Clarity mudra and draw in the south’s qi to blow upon the talisman. Then, face west, bow seven times, knock the teeth seven times, hold the breath seven times, and inscribe the White Emperor’s talisman. Form the Jade Clarity mudra and draw in the west’s qi to blow upon the talisman. Next, face north, bow five times, knock the teeth five times, hold the breath five times, and inscribe the Black Emperor’s talisman. Form the Jade Clarity mudra and draw in the north’s qi to blow upon the talisman. Finally, face the Heavenly Gate, bow twelve times, knock the teeth twelve times, hold the breath twelve times, and inscribe the Yellow Emperor’s talisman. Form the Jade Clarity mudra and draw in the upper qi to blow upon the talisman.

After five years of wearing it, the Black Emperor will dispatch five Mysterious Numinous Jade Lads and five Great Mystery Jade Maidens to welcome the practitioner into the Five Qi Mysterious Heaven, where they will be enfeoffed as a Perfected of the Black Emperor.

**Central Yellow Emperor’s Earth-Function Talisman**
Should the earth spirits, water deities, Five Marchmounts, Nine Provinces, or any of the myriad spirits of the golden horse post routes fail to submit to the Three Realms and the Five Emperors, let this talisman be presented to the Upper Clarity.

This talisman assists the Four Emperors in the generation and transformation of the myriad things, pacifies the Central Marchmount, corrects the Earth Star’s deviations, regulates the turning jade armillary of the central Dipper’s seven lodges, summons harmonious qi, dispels the disharmonies of the four seasons’ proper commands, governs the demonic afflictions of central naked creatures, commands the spirits and gods of the center, summons the immortals of the Central Three Realms (upper, middle, and lower), and cures diseases of the spleen, stomach, and skin. After twelve years of wearing it, the Yellow Emperor will dispatch Yellow Numinous Jade Lads and Yellow Plain Jade Maidens to welcome the practitioner into the One Qi Heaven, where they will be enfeoffed as a Perfected of the Yellow Emperor.

The talismans of the Four Emperors of the four directions may all be used interchangeably, but the Central Yellow Emperor’s talisman may not be worn except by kings and marquises.

**The Great Brahmā’s Flying Void Scripture**
The Mysterious Master said: Whenever a student of the Dao encounters the Three Origins, Eight Nodal Days, or the turning point of their life destiny; when the land suffers disasters, famine, or untimely harvests; when the Dharma-body is clouded by illness, the five tones are cursed, baleful stars shine directly, or malevolent planets press from the side; when the common people suffer unjust grievances, men and women fail to bear children, or fierce and violent mountain spirits assail; when aerial or subterranean spirits, half-celestial deities, or monstrous anomalies bring misfortune that is difficult to remedy—

They should constantly practice the Way of the Flying Void: prostrate with a petition from the heart, tread the *Big Dipper*’s path and the *Winnowing Basket*’s *Gang*, walk the path where *Kan* and *Li* intersect, silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor, circulate the thought of the One Mud-Pill’s principle, and penetrate the profound and obscure. Then will ghosts and spirits tremble and submit, the myriad qi abide long, suffering be avoided, the body radiate light, the myriad qi ascend as immortals, disasters retreat, misfortunes cease, calamities be averted, and wrongs be halted—truly, this is the wondrous Dao of the Supreme Treasure’s upper scriptures.

On the day of purification at the hour of *yin* at dawn, enter the chamber, sit upright, and press the Mudrā of the Numinous Treasure with both hands upon the left and right knees. Be as you naturally are, so that inner thoughts do not stray outward and outer thoughts do not intrude inward. With right mindfulness, settle the spirit and visualize the five viscera and six bowels, inside and out, gleaming and translucent.

Visualize the sun and moon to the left of the face, nine inches away, and a five-colored circular image emerging from the crown of the head, within which is a precious pearl, faintly rotating in the void. Next, envision the thirty-two Heavenly Emperor Lords, each riding a five-colored, eight-scened chariot, arriving from their respective directions. From the crown of the head, each emits the true qi of their direction’s color, like threads intertwining, myriad strands of precious light converging with one’s own true qi.

After completing the visualization, strike the ritual drum twenty-four times to gather the twenty-four qi. Feel the numinous qi spiral upward from the lower cinnabar field, intertwining at the heart, gently coiling and ascending. From between the brows, it emerges at the hairline, transforming into the twenty-four deities.

Next, envision behind the spine a pair of palaces, like halls of lapis lazuli, within which rests a translucent crystal pearl, radiant with inner light. From the tailbone’s kidney origin, an azure spring surges upward, reversing its flow to ascend to the Mud-Pill Palace, where sun and moon illumine a terrace of flowing golden and jade light. Above it, the Primordial Azure Emperor descends with the five qi—purple, yellow, white, azure, and green—directly entering the crown of the head to form a jeweled terrace.

Then visualize one’s own numinous qi transforming into a perfected being seated upon the terrace, as myriad qi converge. The body, bathed in the radiance of a hundred treasures, perceives the three realms and ten directions with utter clarity, inner and outer as if before one’s eyes.

Thereafter, silently recite the sixty-four verses of the Great Brahma Concealed Speech. With each verse, press the fingers through the twelve palaces from *zi* to *hai*, drawing in qi and exhaling it upon the body. At the four verses of *kan*, *li*, *qian*, and *kun*, strike the teeth thirty-six times, visualizing the qi of the Three Clarities intermingling, where sun and moon exchange their light. Draw in the qi, rinse the mouth with saliva, and swallow nine times.

The incantation reads:
*Mystic yellow, pure radiance, resplendent Purple Tenuity.*
*Primordial azure, numinous Sanskrit, golden mushrooms interluminous.*
*Emerging from nothingness, entering emptiness, the subtle and wondrous portal.*
*Knitting the numinous embryo, transforming into the infant.*
*Flaring and casting the flowing bells, luxuriant, shifting into verdant peaks.*
*Myriad heavens arrayed in support, afar they reveal their robes.*
*Three fields overflowing with light, auspicious radiance soaring like rainbows.*
*Yellow and Old transform into immortals, transcending suffering and peril.*
*Non-action, supreme benevolence, with the Dao unblemished.*

Upon completion, ingest the talisman, rise, and exit the chamber without glancing back. Practicing thus for sixty-four days, all spirits will be subdued and summoned, legions of immortals gathered. The heavens will be free of impurity, the earth devoid of malevolent dust. Profound wisdom will pervade purity, and one shall attain the boundless rank of the Mysterious and Profound Great Cavern.

The *Yuan Gang* flows and evolves the *gang*; the method follows the steps while reciting the incantation, beginning at *xu* and returning to *hai*.

**Transformation into a Spirit:**
Become an Upper Clarity Perfected, clad in the regalia of the Great Cavern, holding a jade tablet, ascending a five-dragon chariot to soar and pay homage to the Upper Clarity.

For all petitions of the heart’s chapter, use descending true incense. The envelope should be three inches and seven *fen* in length, one inch and two *fen* in width. Inside, place yellow silk one foot and two inches long, three inches and six *fen* high. Grind cinnabar to write in fine script, with no fixed number of lines, leaving three *fen* at the top and one *fen* at the bottom. First inscribe: *"On the [day] of the [month], [year], at the hour of dawn, [name], having fasted and bathed, with reverence and awe, prostrates and bows, purifies the heart, and respectfully submits this petition."* Thereafter, conclude simply with *"respectfully stated."*

Seal the outside with the *Three Origins Flying Qi Jade Chapter* seal. Inside, at the beginning and end of the chapter, inscribe *"Your servant, [name], seals this"* with a prostration before and after. When dispatching, burn it in the fragrant flames while reciting the *Lingbao Heart Incantation*, visualizing the submission as in the previous method.

**Talisman on the Envelope’s Base**
**Talisman on the Talisman Bag**

Upon completing the chapter, inscribe the date and hour of the current year under the Tai Sui at the altar. At the appointed time, dispatch it through the Three Celestial Gates, urgently submitting it to the attending officials for immediate execution, with no delay, awaiting swift response—*hastily, as decreed by the statutes and ordinances.*

**Lingbao Heart Incantation**
*Converge primordial yang, gather the Three Spirits.*
*Bind the hun, restrain the po, inner radiance of cavernous light.*
*The sprout of mysterious shadow, the Dao pierces the inception of azure.*
*Three Sections, Eight Sceneries, qi suffuses the profound and obscure.*
*The heart revolves north and south, Kan and Li conjoin their essence.*
*True net, dense and boundless, felicitous opening of the Eight Gates.*
*Soaring through the Three Heavens, uniting to govern Heaven and Earth.*

For all talismans and incantations written hereafter, employ this incantation, invoking the Shangqing mudra while visualizing oneself as the Lingbao Heavenly Worthy.

**Great Brahma Thunder-Spirit Chapter**
The Master of the Mysterious said: When the sun and moon suffer eclipse, mountains and rivers quake and roar, pestilence and poison spread, yin and yang lose their order, cold and heat deviate from their seasons—those who practice the Dao must enter the oratory, sit upright, and recite the *Great Brahma Rectified Tone Chapter*, while wearing the *Great Brahma Thunder-Spirit Talisman* to repel the myriad calamities, summon harmonious qi, and shield the practitioner’s body, thereby securing peace for the land and its people.

The method requires writing the talisman in cinnabar on yellow silk, then wearing it upon the body. Thus, one may invoke the Five Emperors to assist, the myriad sages to descend, and the flying transcendence of the Dharma-body, attaining the rank of Perfected and averting misfortune.

When inscribing, visualize oneself as the Dao Lord, invoke the Shangqing mudra, and draw upon the orthodox methods of the Nine Empyreans. Rotate the brush around the silk while silently reciting the incantation, striking the teeth thrice before writing.

**Incantation:**
*Brahma qi pervades the net of space, Great Brahma’s flowing light.*
*Spread as the true table, mysterious response to the morning sun.*
*Flourishing blossoms gleam, guarding the Central Yellow.*
*Stirring the stalwart spirits, rectifying the Dipper’s bright beam.*
*Guiding the vast Brahma current, disciplining the mysterious stem.*
*Great thunderous numinous sound, harmonizing yin and yang.*
*Commanding the myriad spirits, restoring the true and constant.*
*Subduing the hordes of demons, I ascend the supreme throne.*
*Hastily, as decreed by the Lingbao statutes and ordinances!*

**The Great Method of the Numinous Treasure’s Infinite Salvation of Humankind, Sutra of Supreme Efficacy, Scroll Thirty-Five: The Chapter on Refining Form and Spirit**

**Section on the Method of Refining Spirit**

The method is practiced after the advent of the first yang. One receives the refinement of form and spirit. Only after a full year may one memorialize the Celestial Emperor, traverse the Three Realms, summon and gather the souls of the deceased, and proceed with deliverance. If salvation is urgently required before the year is complete, one must petition the Perfected of Refined Salvation, the Nine Radiance Lads, and the True Overseers of the Refinement Bureau, memorializing the Great Emperor of Vermilion Mound, the Three Qi Heavenly Lords, the True Lord of Mars, the Lord of Salvation in the Southern Palace’s Upper Palace, the True Sage of the Fire Bureau who gathers and refines souls, the Envoys of Soul-Gathering, and the generals, officers, and soldiers—all stationed to one’s left and right. Thus, the host of Perfected may supervise the deliverance, and demonic trials will silently dissolve.

Ordinary yin souls measure no more than two feet in height. Those who in life were afflicted with crooked mouths, limps, mutilations, or wounds from blades—whose forms were incomplete—remain so in the Nether Bureau. They must undergo the affairs of the Five Bureaus.

The first is the Bureau of the Yellow Springs, called the Palace of the Kidneys. This governs the essence of the Celestial One’s Water Position. One visualizes the Water Spirit as a watery marsh to cleanse the lonely souls.

The second is the Bureau of Yang Brightness, called the Palace of the Heart. This pertains to the essence of the Earthly Two’s Fire Position. One visualizes the Fire Spirit as a fiery pool to refine the lonely souls. Once cleansed and refined, they must not lack the Five Bureaus.

Next, one visualizes the Celestial Three generating Wood, associated with the liver, as the Bureau of Generation, symbolizing spring’s vivification of beings.

Then, one envisions the Earthly Four generating Metal, as the Lung Palace, called the Bureau of Kunlun, symbolizing autumn’s harvest.

Spring pertains to the liver, the Wood Position, governed by the Azure Dragon. Autumn pertains to the lungs, the Metal Position, governed by the White Tiger. Summer corresponds to the Vermilion Bird, aligned with the heart; winter to the Dark Warrior, aligned with the kidneys. With the Four Symbols complete, the myriad spirits all return. In the Central Yellow Court, one silently conducts the affairs of the Five Bureaus.

One visualizes the Spleen Spirit in the Central Palace as the Bureau of the Yellow Court, which nurtures the myriad beings. With the Five Phases fully arrayed, the myriad spirits all attain harmony. Only then are the forms of the deceased souls complete, allowing them to be cleansed and refined, that they may be reborn in the celestial realms, adorned in radiant immortal raiment. The Court of Flowing Fire blazes, fire bells cover the ground, and flames illuminate the celestial realms. From this, each lonely soul ascends to the immortal lands, forever departing the bitter destinies. Thereafter, the Mysterious Ancestor, riding this wondrous cause, transcends in spirit, roaming freely above the rosy clouds, attaining the truth of the Dao.

Each day at dawn, burn incense and face the sun. First, rub the palms until scorching hot, then wipe the eyes, ears, and nostrils—three times on each side. Then, press the Four Gates Mudra, constricting the middle crease of the middle finger. Visualize the Azure Emperor of the East riding the Azure Dragon, merging with the azure qi of one’s own liver, emerging from the eyes to become one. Press the Mao Seal, silently recite "red apricot," and inhale the azure qi, guiding the fluid into the liver.

Next, envision the White Emperor of the West riding the White Dragon, merging with the white qi of one’s own lungs, emerging from the nose to become one. Press the You Seal, silently recite "grinding true," and inhale the white qi, guiding the fluid into the lungs.

Then, envision the Crimson Emperor of the South riding the Crimson Dragon, merging with the crimson qi of one’s own heart, emerging from the mouth to become one. Press the Wu Seal, silently recite "sandalwood wax," and inhale the crimson qi, guiding the fluid into the heart.

Next, envision the Black Emperor of the North riding the Black Dragon, merging with the black qi of one’s own kidneys, emerging from the ears to become one. Press the Zi Seal, silently recite "inky black," and inhale the black qi, guiding the fluid into the kidneys.

Then, envision the Yellow Emperor of the Center riding the Yellow Dragon, merging with the yellow qi of one’s own spleen, emerging from the lips to become one. Press the middle crease of the middle finger, silently recite "Numinous Treasure," and inhale the yellow qi, guiding the fluid into the spleen. Visualize the Five Viscera suffused with their respective colors, vibrant and full. Then, bow to the Five Directions and recite the *Metal Fluid Refining Form Incantation* and the *Great Fluid Incantation*, drawing nine breaths of solar qi to penetrate within and without.

**Metal Fluid Refining Form Incantation:**
*Metal fluid refines form, uniting with the Dao as true.*
*Revealing the Three Luminaries, this is the root of heaven.*
*No darkness, no limit, no beginning, no end.*
*Primal August Nine Shames, numinous demons of the Crimson Palace.*
*Purple qi soars to heaven, the body rides six dragons.*
*Fire above, water below, flowing into the Three Palaces.*
*Spirit dwells in Yang Brightness, the Great Dao opens of itself.*
*Hastily, as decreed by the Ordinances of the Upper Clarity’s Metal Fluid Refining Form!*

**Great Fluid Refining Form Incantation:**
*Great fluid refines form, the golden horse’s courier route.*
*Above and below, water and fire, vast and pure.*
*Primal model vast and boundless, silently delivering humankind.*
*Endless refinement, attaining the Dao as supreme truth.*
*Three Origins descend and unite, Five Qi gather the spirit.*
*The Supreme’s talisman commands, Six Dings silently assist.*
*Purple net luxuriant and elegant, enacting the talisman in Jade Capital.*
*Hastily, as decreed by the Ordinances of the Supreme’s Great Fluid!*

Next, recite the *True One Incantation of the Solar Flowing Gold Fire Bells*:
*Firelight in heaven, moonlight’s essence.*
*Great luminous fire bells, diamond’s essence.*
*Palace of the Sun, Supreme Yang Brightness, assembly of the Dipper’s Five Assistants in the Celestial Court.*
*Guardian bells swiftly dispatch the soldiers of Primordial Zhou.*
*Fierce beasts subdue demons, entering ghostly essences.*
*Mars, Fire Star, Fire Spirit King, Primordial One’s soldiers pacify Fire Mountain.*
*Great Sage Golden Lad, Star Fire, and the Supreme Lad’s ominous flowing gold decree.*
*Diamond’s precious light, ordinances command.*
*Hastily, as decreed by the Ordinances of the Precious Light of Mars in the South!*

**Method of Self-Refinement**

Each day at dawn, burn a small measure of incense and stand within the Dipper. Visualize oneself as the Perfected of Refined Salvation. First, press the Four Gates Mudra, calm the spirit, and dispel thoughts. Hold the Jade Emperor Mudra with both hands, crossing them over the mouth. Silently recite the *Metal Fluid Refining Form Incantation*, gaze directly at the sun, and inhale one breath, swallowing thrice. Inhale nine breaths, recite the incantation three times, and visualize the sun’s ninefold radiance entering the mouth. Then recite the *Great Fluid Incantation*, performing the same actions as with the Metal Fluid.

Once the qi-swallowing is complete, recite the *Incantation for Refining the Spirit*:

*"The Supreme refines the spirit,
Nine steps through the Eight Kun.
Ninefold firmness in motion,
Within and without all perfected.
At the Zi-Wu hour of the Three Terraces,
The Crimson Palace receives the Perfected.
Talismans refine the myriad spirits,
A crimson heart descends its essence.
The heart repels venom and malice,
All comings and goings flourish in glory.
The Northern Capital’s winding precincts,
Merge with the Upper Clarity.
The Great Cavern’s spontaneity,
Wind and fire never cease.
Hastily, as decreed by the Ordinances of the Supreme’s Manifest Form!"*

Then, gaze upward at the sun, cross the *Chou Mudra* of both hands over the mouth, inhale nine breaths, and swallow thrice. Recite the incantation three times, as in the previous method.

Next, recite the incantation:

*"Kun’s compliance nurtures the inner,
Jia and Ji conceal the form.
The Three Hun are refined,
The Seven Po become true.
The Five Qi govern the center,
Severing the roots of evil.
The Nine Palaces harmonize,
Their names inscribed in the Upper Clarity.
The Great One embraces the primordial,
Slaying and vanquishing demonic essence.
The Three Enclosures and Four Directions,
Earth and Kun are at peace.
Spirit, Hun, true Po,
Come and go to the Jade Capital.
The Five Peaks tremble and submit,
All poisons overturn of themselves.
Hastily, as decreed by the Ordinances of the Supreme’s Spirit-Refining!"*

Then, gaze upward at the sun, swallow qi, and recite the incantation as before, followed by the true qi of Mars.

Recite the incantation:

*"Lord of the Southern Quarter,
Essence of crimson qi.
Mars’ envoys,
Bing and Ding generals.
Vermilion Phoenix, flame spirit,
Resplendent yang essence.
The Five Phases engender transformation,
Myriad beings arise.
The Heavenly Emperor decrees,
Envoys must heed.
Summon and refine Hun and Po,
Refining the true form.
Dispel calamity, extinguish misfortune,
Revive the dead and restore life.
Hastily, as decreed by the Ordinances!"*

Then, form the *Fire Mudra* with both hands, draw the true fire of the South, and swallow it thrice. Recite the *True One Incantation of the Fire Bell* once more. Gaze upward at the South and draw qi as before.

Next, sit upright in the Ding stance, draw one breath of true fire from the South, and blow it onto the ground to the left and southeast of the body, visualizing it as a fire pool. Envision the great spirit refining the body, riding a dragon and spewing fire into the pool. With the *Sword Mudra* of the right hand, stir the heart-fire from within the mouth. With the *Fire Mudra* of the left hand, direct it into the fire pool, blazing fiercely to refine the entire body until it is luminous and unobstructed, with no shadow of yin. Once fully permeated, visualize a crimson dragon flying from the flames into the left ear.

Next, form the *Zi Mudra*, draw one breath of true water from the North, and blow it onto the ground to the right and northwest of the body, visualizing it as a water pool. Envision jade maidens riding phoenixes and exhaling qi into the pool. With the *Sword Mudra* of the right hand, stir the kidney-water from within the mouth. Draw the northern qi, form the *Zi Mudra*, and blow it into the water pool, its waves surging to cleanse the body until it is crystalline and spotless, with no dust or blemish, permeating both within and without. Once complete, visualize a black dragon flying from the water into the right ear, and the water recedes.

Then recite the incantation:

*"The spirit and Hun are serene and upright,
The myriad qi endure forever.
Unburdened by suffering,
The body radiates light.
The Three Realms guard and attend,
The Five Emperors govern and welcome.
Myriad spirits pay homage,
Names inscribed in Heaven.
Virtues perfected, merits fulfilled,
Ascend to the Upper Clarity."*

Recite another incantation:

*"The embodied self receives deliverance,
Enduring through kalpas unceasing."*

Recite this thrice, click the teeth, bow with the heart, and withdraw.

For those practicing the Way of Refining and Deliverance, it is essential to frequently recite the *Great Incantation of the Southern Clarity for Refining, Deliverance, and Dispelling Filth from the Dragon’s Han*, without regard to the number of repetitions. Thus, the refining and deliverance of the departed souls will benefit from its merits and swiftly attain liberation.

Another incantation:

*"The Dragon’s Han is vast and boundless."*

**The Jade Refining Method of the Cavern Yang**

The *Jade Refining Method of the Cavern Yang* has long been recorded in the registers of immortals, yet few can practice it. Though one may have eyes to see within a li, what lies beyond remains unseen. Though one may have ears to hear within the walls of a lofty hall, what lies beyond remains unheard. How much less can the distant realms of the hidden and the manifest be perceived by sight or sound? Only by the grace of the Supreme Emperor, who bestows wondrous transformations, commanding the Fire Bureau and decreeing the Earth Spirits, can refining and deliverance be enacted.

If one cannot refine oneself, how can one refine ghosts? Ghosts dwell in the dark and shadowy realms of the unseen. Through this refining and deliverance, they are cleansed of filth, their hundred bones suffused with light, and only then may they attain liberation. It is like smelting metal—if one cannot smelt oneself, how can one cast metal? The Supreme Emperor, pitying the ignorance of the lower realms, dispatched the Six Jia Immortals to descend into the world during the Xia Yuan Jiazi year, transmitting this method, known as the *Forbidden Writ of the Jade Emperor*. It is not something that lesser scholars may see or hear.

To leak or profane it is to violate the statutes, and the crime is unforgivable. In the unseen, it implicates one’s distant ancestors; in the manifest, it brings disaster to one’s descendants, with calamities following one after another. How can one not be cautious?

For those who practice this method, if they are determined to deliver the departed, they must first refine their own primordial yang, molding and casting the myriad patterns. Without seeking the true, they become true of themselves; without seeking the divine, they become divine of themselves. In harmony with the Great Mystery, the suffering souls find refuge.

Those who covet empty fame, betray the Dao, and deceive others are but walking corpses and wandering ghosts, mocked in the unseen realms, with no recourse for prayer. Beware, beware! Exert yourself in refining body and spirit, and both the hidden and manifest will be blessed.

**The Monthly Jade Refining Method**

The essence of the sun takes a round form, its radiance a square, its color crimson. On the third, ninth, seventeenth, fifteenth, and twenty-second days of each month—five occasions in total—perform the refining above the Gate of Metal. With the *Golden Essence Stone Radiance Water Mother Mushroom*, refine the sun’s soul. On these days, the sun’s splendor scatters, the golden essence overflows, and all under Heaven receives its moisture.

If on these days one gathers the sun’s root, the numinous descends to the Jade Portal, and by practicing this method, one ascends to the Gate of Metal. The Gate of Metal lies above the Western Pass of Heaven, the portal through which the sun and moon communicate their numinosity.

To gather the sun’s root, first draw a bottle of well-flower water and expose it in the central courtyard. On green paper, write in cinnabar the *Jade Talisman of Stone Radiance Water Mother*, place it in the water, and face the water while clicking the teeth sixteen times.

Recite the incantation:

*"Radiant Yang’s luminous essence,
glows resplendent in the Purple Court.
Eight rays shine brightly,
soul’s brilliance overflows in full.
Five revolutions, three returns—
qi circulates through the Great Numinosity.
Fragrant streams curve and pour,
shading and moistening all living beings.
Adorned at the Gate of Metal,
the root of splendor gleams fresh.
Consume the Stone Radiance,
Water Mother pours forth essence.
Follow the turning of Heaven’s darkness,
revolve with the sun’s glory.
Nine apertures receive the true,
liberating the original form.
Hasten, hasten, as the statutes command!"*

Then face the sun’s zenith, click the teeth twenty-four times, and ingest the talisman while reciting:

*"The Yang essence now flows,
flying splendor renewed.
Imperial rays overflow,
shading and infusing the inner coils.
Gaze upward to feast on the mysterious moisture,
fragrant radiance arrives in full.
Palace and dwelling open wide,
washing away the dust of clamor.
The body reflects jade’s light,
the face emits golden truth.
Spirit soars with Yu’s steps,
ascending to the Gate of the Sun.
Hasten, hasten, as the statutes command!"*

Then tilt the head back, draw in the sun’s qi forty-five times, and use the remaining water to wash the face and bathe. Return to the chamber.

Next, face west, click the teeth twenty-four times, close the eyes, and visualize five-colored streaming clouds descending from the sun to encircle the body, along with a purple cloud, large as the pupil of the eye, layered tenfold within the radiant five colors. Draw the qi into the mouth forty-five times, and chew the saliva nine times.

Recite the incantation:

*"The sun’s soul scatters light,
five colors pour in abundance.
Refining the form at the Gate of Metal,
the circular radiance towers majestically.
Numinous brilliance shines forth,
receiving illumination from the Celestial River.
Jade mushrooms overflow,
orchid moisture exudes fragrance.
Drink of my Yellow Spring,
nourish me with flying splendor.
Sip the root, swallow the essence—
longevity equals the numinous tree.
Form clings to the Great Radiance,
the body ascends with flying clouds.
For a thousand ages, ten thousand kalpas,
grant me this boon.
Hasten, hasten, as the statutes command!"*

Then bow three times with the heart.

*Stone Radiance Ninefold-Refined Water Mother Jade Talisman*
The *Moon Splendor* is square in form, its circular radiance suffused with yellow qi. On the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month—once or twice—it passes above the Eastern Well. The Eastern Well is the Gate of Mysterious Radiance.

To gather the moon’s splendor: when the moon approaches the Eastern Well, draw well-flower water at dawn and expose it in the central courtyard. At midnight, write in cinnabar the *Yang Essence Jade Womb Refined Immortal True Talisman* on white paper, place the talisman in the water, and face the water while reciting:

*"Yellow qi and Yang essence,
threefold conjoined to condense light.
Mysterious radiance returns to true,
adorned with eight rays.
Refined and transmuted at the Eastern Well,
receiving illumination from the flying star.
Golden splendor scatters numinosity,
the Five Lords diffuse fragrance.
The Lady descends with sweet dew,
sprinkling the ten directions.
Vast fragrance pours downward,
filling the six viscera to overflowing.
Golden essence undergoes nine transformations,
altering the radiance to restore the countenance.
Hasten, hasten, as the statutes command!"*

Next, face the moon and strike the teeth thirty-six times in succession. Ingest the talisman while reciting the incantation:

*"Riding the void, drifting like mist,
roaming and feasting in the great emptiness.
Ascending to the moon’s courtyard,
paired with the perfected as a twin.
Transforming through the eight paths,
emerging from being and entering non-being.
Dual luminances shine as one,
eternally preserved without diminution.
Hasten, hasten, as the statutes command!"*

Then, tilt the head back and draw in the moon’s *qi* fifty times, swallowing it. Use the remaining water to bathe and wash the face, then return indoors. Next, face east and strike the teeth thirty-six times in succession. Close the eyes and visualize the five-colored streaming light of the moon descending to envelop the body, along with a yellow *qi* as large as the pupil of the eye, square and round, layered dozens of times inside and out, gleaming within the five colors and entering the *Dongfang* together with the *qi*. Then draw in the *qi* fifty times and swallow the saliva fifteen times to conclude.

Recite the incantation:

*"Concealing heaven and embracing light,
yellow *qi* dense and luxuriant.
Congealing essence and containing condensation,
eight rays radiant and resplendent.
Adorning the yellow splendor,
jade radiance pouring and irrigating.
Jade mushrooms overflowing,
moistening the light of the celestial vastness.
All under heaven receives the moisture,
ascending at dawn’s first light.
Riding the radiance to ascend the void,
attaining the ascent to the imperial palace.
The Eternal Yang descends to the world,
transcending the eight adversities.
Shining with the sun’s brilliance,
equal in stem with the moon.
Hasten, hasten, as the statutes command!"*

Next, bow three times with the heart.

**Yang Essence Jade Womb Refined Immortal True Talisman**
**Nine Palaces Insight Method**

The Mysterious Master said: Those without steadfast power who encounter all manner of wayless ghosts and spirits may rely on the Nine Palaces method. For men, begin at the *Li* palace at age one and proceed in sequence; for women, begin at the *Kan* palace at age one and proceed in reverse. Each year shifts to the next palace. Determine the palace of the year, then proceed to the month, the day, and the hour. From the hour, trace back to identify the affliction or transgression when the ghost or spirit manifests. Note the year’s branch, month’s branch, day’s branch, and directional location to discern the ghost or spirit’s form and condition.

**Qian**: The *Qian* image governs heavy-headedness, difficulty in lifting the body’s weight. Both feet grow cold and painful—haunted by a Yang person. A grave illness clings to the body until death; the northwest is the place of sinking. Burning incense may reveal vows, black-clad spirits, or malevolent souls.

**Kan**: The *Kan* palace brings bodily confusion, reluctance to speak, and rumbling intestines. Water toxins or bloating, drowning, or speechlessness may occur. Wandering in the due north, strange dreams and mournful wailing of the feet. A ghost of yin or yang haunts—inquire closely to uncover the cause.

**Gen**: The *Gen* direction brings heart and gut vexation, throat blockage and injury. Mad speech and strange behavior, sorrowful laughter beyond measure. A group of eight ghosts must be present; they roam temples and shrines without concealment. Further, wood and metal anomalies—examine the northeast for their forms and lights.

**Zhen**: The *Zhen* palace brings pestilence, alternating chills and fever spreading to the four limbs. Aversion to food, cursing, and blasphemy—offending the celestial envoys. Death by punishment, plague, or fright, with cyan and green dead spirits following. Red and yellow female ghosts appear; within three days, peril looms.

**Xun**: The *Xun* palace harbors mad ghosts, blindness, and loss of sight. Ancestral spirits speak in yin voices; external afflictions are women. Souls and spirits fall into the hands of ghosts, causing day and night groaning. Only through purifying fasts and seeking the great Dao can health and peace be preserved.

**Li**: The *Li* palace in the due south brings abscesses, boils, burns, and scalds. Excessive heat and jaundice, blood ghosts and deaths from childbirth. Crimson and purple victims of violent death, their spirits clinging to kin—yang souls. Face the fire’s position to confront the malevolent ghosts and discern their movements.

**Kun**: The *Kun* region brings spleen and stomach ailments, dysentery, and bodily emaciation. Prolonged illness resists cure; the southwest harbors hidden corpses. Disturbing the earth injures the year’s breaker, revealing spectral lights at that time. Drawn by ancestral mothers, lingering dead spirits, and dragon *po*.

**Dui**: The *Dui* palace brings consumptive corpse *zhu*, wheezing, coughing, and stagnation. Burial misfortune and inauspicious seating, punishment and injury with lingering connections. Premature death seeks merit and virtue; ancient artifacts lie near the dwelling. Three ghostly companions together incur grievances and transgressions.

The Mysterious Master said: For all practices of recitation, salvation, disaster mitigation, subjugation, healing, incantations over objects, vanquishing malevolent spirits, averting inauspicious omens, repelling spectral lights, summoning dragons to bring rain, praying for clear skies and luminosity, halting floods and extinguishing fires, dispelling plagues and removing harm, activating talismans and consecrated water, restraining venomous beasts, seeking immortality and cultivating the true, the seven classics and eight wefts, descending the perfected and summoning spirits—all require the secret recitation of the *Ling Shu* ten thousand times. Thereafter, whatever is desired will swiftly manifest as divine efficacy. Gradually reaching one hundred thousand recitations, one attains natural mastery, and transformation knows no bounds. For major matters, write in hidden script, burn and scatter the ashes, or place them on high mountains, rocky valleys, or stone surfaces. Alternatively, bury them in the earth or sink them in water. For deeply harvesting immortal medicines to cure illness, use this hidden script, reciting strictly according to the oral instructions.

**Numinous Treasure Divine Mirror Method**

The Dao’s utmost emptiness responds and moves all things to life. Heaven’s utmost purity mirrors and oversees all directions without concealment. Earth’s utmost stillness nurtures and bears all things in peace. Water’s utmost clarity moistens and transforms all beings to completion. The sun and moon’s utmost brightness illuminates and warms all paths with radiance. If there exists a thing that can embody the sun and moon, and water’s clarity that can symbolize heaven and earth, then the Dao’s purity and stillness, empty yet responding to things endlessly, never retaining anything—externally, this is the nine-inch round mirror; internally, it is the square-inch *Jianggong*.

Thus, the great method of the Numinous Treasure Dao takes the mysterious dwelling as its foundation. To communicate with spirits and penetrate the wondrous, the bright mirror serves as the beginning. Therefore, the *Daluo* Heaven’s phase first expounds the eighteen wondrous methods of the Numinous Treasure Divine Mirror, encompassing the great numbers of the nine heavens and nine earths. It illuminates the obscure and dim, discerning the secret mechanisms of ghosts and spirits. Penetrating the mysterious and perceiving the subtle, it knows the hidden and manifest of sages and mortals. Illuminating the five palaces and reflecting the ten directions, it is like the moon viewing the palm. The method employs a nine-inch round mirror, clear, lustrous, and undisturbed by polishing. Follow the prescribed form, recite the incantation, and infuse the mirror’s surface with *qi*. After eighty-one days, the Yang number’s method is complete, and the divine light will manifest true traces in all directions.

To perceive the Three Realms with penetrating vision and see clearly through the ten directions—nothing, not even the finest detail, can escape, let alone the forms and traces of ghosts and spirits. Yet if the mind is not pure and upright, thoughts not empty and still, or the will not immaculate and sincere, demonic spirits may transform and manifest false apparitions. Practitioners, can you afford not to be vigilant?

**Lingbao Five Peaks and Three Paths Treasure Illumination Incantation**
Red apricot, ink-black, grind true, wrap the sole, Lingbao.

With the left hand, form the cyclic mudra of *Zhen*, *Kan*, *Dui*, and *Li*, recite the incantation, and press the *Lingbao* mudra at the middle joint of the middle finger. Draw the *qi* of the five directions and blow it onto the mirror. Once done, recite the incantation:

*"Gongdu gathers the souls, summoning the swift messengers of the eight directions.
Heavenly spirits, earthly deities—
ten thousand spirits unite, joining the celestial and terrestrial mandates to bind and command."*

After reciting the incantation, draw the *qi* of the central heaven and blow it toward the *Gen* direction, then inhale the *qi* of *Gen* and blow it onto the mirror. Once done, trace the eight trigrams with the thumb and recite:

*"Reverently invoke the great spirits of the eight trigrams—*Qian*, *Kan*, *Gen*, *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Li*, *Kun*, *Dui*—to hasten the heavenly spirits and earthly deities of the eight directions, that their forms may appear within my mirror."*

With the left hand, trace the *Lingbao* mudra of the eight trigrams; with the right hand’s *Lingbao* mudra, use the middle finger to mark eight points on the mirror’s surface, beginning at *Qian* and proceeding to *Dui*. Then trace back to the *Lingbao* mudra, press firmly, inhale the harmonized *qi* of the eight directions, and blow it onto the mirror. Place the mudra upon the mirror and recite the **Lingbao Celestial Entry Chamber Bright Mirror Incantation**:

*"Wind gathers in the east,
Xun’s clouds rise to the heavens.
Qian’s *qi* collects the Dipper,
Qian’s rain scatters the five directions."*

Blow the *qi* of the two corners onto the mirror, then form the cyclic mudra of the Five Peaks. Recite the incantation:

*"Lin."*

The red apricot enters heaven and forms, shattering the images to rectify the eight directions.
In the east, *Mao*, ink-black takes shape.
Rain descends, rain confronts; the Four Waterways’ dragons align with *Qian*, the primordial spirit gathers the trigrams.
In the north, *Kan* grinds true thoughts to reveal gold; wielding the armor of a thousand men, *Kun* stirs the *qi* of the five directions.
In the west, *Dui*’s *waluo* illumines the Southern Dipper; my great overflow rests in hand, earth’s primordial responds to heaven’s primordial.
Within *Li*, the numinous treasure guards the heart.
The middle finger arranges the *waluo* in knotted patterns; the image should shatter the palace to seize it.

With the right hand, trace the mudra of the Five Peaks, recite the incantation, and draw the *qi* of the five directions to blow upon the mirror. Recite once more, then retreat from the central pattern to *Dui*, press firmly upon the mudra, inhale the *qi* of the west, and blow. This is the *Lingbao* Five Gates Mirror Method for entering the Dao.
Thereafter, summon the celestial spirits into the mirror and sharply observe them within. The incantation reads:

*"By the Emperor’s decree, the numinous treasure shines forth."*

With the right hand, draw the *qi* of the south, *Li*’s pattern, and blow upon the mirror. Recite again:

*"From whence do I derive this power? Sharply observe the celestial spirits within the mirror.
Gather the ancestral *qi* of the Three Origins; the great celestial dharma proceeds.
Above, collect the eight directions; *Qian*’s primordial aids the Great Yang.
Illusory yin descends from the night; I array myself toward the five directions."*

With the right hand, recite the incantation once, inhale the *qi* of the gates of heaven, earth, and humanity, and blow. Recite the incantation again, inhale the *qi* of the eight directions, and blow. Recite once more, draw the *qi* of the Great Yang, and blow upon the mirror. Next, recite the incantation again, inhale the *qi* from the north, then the *qi* of the five directions—west, south, east, and center—and blow upon the mirror.
Thus may one observe the celestial spirits manifest in form. If the vision remains dim and unseen, recite the *Moving Dimness Incantation*:

**Moving Dimness Treasure Illumination Incantation**
*"Dimness shifts, flashes shatter; clarity arises at the wings’ corners.
Open the luminous *qi* of Lord Gong; sever, gather, and expel.
Lift, press, move—spirits clear and stir, spirits clear and stir.
Gather, gather."*

With the right hand, form the *Lingbao* mudra, inhale the bright light of the sun and moon, and blow upon the mirror. If the distinctions among directions remain unclear, recite the *Celestial Capital Incantation*:

**Celestial Capital Concealed Treasure Illumination Incantation**
*"Moving *qi* drills the five notes; the celestial gate closes to admit the true.
Perverse *qi* violates the five phases; earth’s *qi* seizes the three yin.
The dharma’s numen hastens the destruction of the false; the three yang disperse with the sun.
Encountering yin, seize the yang; by decree, resonance is severed and gathered.
Decree and seize."*

With the right hand, recite the incantation once, press the *Lingbao* mudra, inhale the *qi* of the celestial gate, and blow upon the mirror. Recite the incantation again, draw the *qi* of the Great Yang, and blow upon the mirror. When complete, invoke and unite the names and ranks of the celestial spirits to be illuminated, and blow into the mirror.
Next, recite the *Five Peaks Incantation* to hasten the union and illumination of the celestial spirits for clear vision:

**Lingbao Five Peaks Spirit Illumination Incantation**
*"The red haze moves through wood; sever the mustache to present the feet.
*Mao*’s ink-black water shatters; yin’s mustache swiftly hastens.
*Kan* grinds true gold sharply; horns align with west and east.
*Dui*’s *waluo* traverses the fire scripture; refine the mustache to perfect me.
*Li*’s numinous treasure, earth’s spirit; the treasure returns to life’s cause.
The center must swiftly hasten, swiftly, swiftly."*

With the left hand, trace the mudra of the Five Peaks from east to north, west, south, and the celestial center, inhale the *qi*, and blow into the mirror to distinguish the ranks of immortals, true beings, ghosts, and creatures, and the myriad differences between the perverse and the upright. Then employ the *Three Paths Incantation* to gather the spirits and perfect the true:

**Three Paths Gathering Light Treasure Illumination Incantation**
*"Rising life turns; *Qian* alone shifts and moves. *Kun* may illuminate Han; *Xun*’s Lord Du achieves completion. Sharply align the corners.
*Gen* confronts the soul’s *qi* to gather and seize.
Gather, gather, gather."*

Recite the incantation, inhale the *qi* of the Three Paths, and blow upon the mirror. Examine closely to perceive the true image, or summon the spirits of the eight directions to move the scene and clearly see the affairs of the eight directions.
Next, recite the *Exchanging Qi Incantation* to achieve perfect clarity:

**Exchanging Qi and Uniting Trigrams Treasure Illumination Incantation**
*"Exchanging *qi* shifts to form firmness; the celestial gate stands to renew knowledge.
The earth’s door seeks the complete pattern of *qi*.
The center."*

With the right hand, press the *Qian-Kun Lingbao* mudra three times, recite the incantation, and blow the *qi* of the three directions upon the mirror to observe the affairs of the eight directions.
If dispatching and then recalling, recite the *Reappearing Incantation*, exchanging *qi* through the Seven Awakenings to restore vision:

**Reappearing Treasure Illumination Incantation**
*"Yin’s spirits thoroughly awaken to extinguish the will to defile; the celestial *Qi*’s spirits gather in response."*

With the right hand, press the *Lingbao* mudra, recite the incantation, inhale the *qi* of the northwest, and blow upon the mirror to immediately manifest the summoned spirit within.

**Five Phases Upright Qi Treasure Illumination Incantation**
*"Red haze, ink-black, true grinding, *waluo*, numinous treasure.
Rising life turns; alone shifts and moves.
May illuminate Han; achievement completes Lord Du.
Sharply align the corners; gather the soul and seize.
Lord Du gathers the soul, summoning the swift messengers of the eight directions, celestial spirits, earthly numina, and the myriad spirits to unite as one.
Unite the decrees of heaven and earth; unite the bright decree of the Celestial Emperor and the sun. Decree and seize."*

First, with the left hand, trace the mudra of the Five Peaks and Three Paths, draw the *qi* of the five directions, and blow upon the mirror. Release the mudra, then trace the mudra of the eight trigrams, and with the right hand, mark eight points upon the mirror’s eight directions. Recite the incantation:

*"Reverently, the great spirits of the eight trigrams—*Qian*, *Kan*, *Gen*, *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Li*, *Kun*, *Dui*—hasten the celestial spirits and earthly numina of the eight directions to manifest their forms within my mirror."*

With the right hand, recite the incantation, then blow the *qi* of the eight directions upon the mirror to illuminate ghosts and spirits.
Then alter the incantation to read:

*"Gather and seize the wayless ghosts of the eight directions to manifest their forms within my mirror."*

**Breaking the Green Register Incantation**
*"Unite to form the pool, heed the beneficial green. White frost’s silk shatters the green; the body stirs at dawn and dusk’s green.
Shatter the corners to distinguish the green; rely upon the western brightness’ green to depart and see the utmost green.
Gather and control, gather and control."*

With the right hand form the *Dongyue* mudra, recite the incantation, and blow the *qi* of the eastern direction upon the mirror to discern the garments of the heroic spirits and the implements of ghosts and souls, which appear visible within the mirror. Should they conceal their deceit or hide their origins, employ the following method.

**Breaking Concealment to Establish the Measure Incantation**
*"Bind intent to shatter the corners and force the measure; echo the name to establish the primordial name-measure.
Seize nature to surpass strength and divide the measure; array the wild and elegant to break the measure."*

By this, the hidden and obscure may be mirrored, whether their falsehoods or truths remain unproven. If still unclear, proceed with the following method.

**Heavenly Cavern Six Spirits Incantation**
*"Three Primes wondrous cavern, fix the Primordial and flourish the pure cavern.
Uphold and urge the conduct cavern; command the crimson firmament to coil the cavern.
Intent traverses to gather the plum cavern; divide the six red caverns."*

With the right hand form the *Lingbao* seal, gaze upward toward the Gate of Heaven, recite the incantation, and draw *qi* to blow upon the principal malevolent spirit who claims to be a great divine immortal. Use this to observe the celestial realm and discern its authenticity. Should it claim to be a star, verify it directly with the following method.

**Wing Constellation Four Spirits Incantation**
*"Wheel-flower year-different spirit, pure jade moon-wing spirit,
Divide and fix to seize the illuminating sun-wing spirit, rejoice and array to assist the timely wing spirit."*

Form the *Lingbao* seal, recite the incantation, and blow the *qi* of the southeast upon it. Then recite again, invoking the year, month, day, and hour, and blow the *qi* of the established direction upon the principal ghost or spirit to expose its false claims of stellar form or its role in causing disasters through human offenses, thereby revealing the truth.

**Illuminating Essence and Unbinding Form Incantation**
*"Summon repose to arrive at emptiness; the five directions gather intent to complete.
Call the sun to bind intent and shatter; see intent arrive within the count.
Bind principle to complete below; divide *qi* within the rosy clouds.
May dawn gather intent to rest; bind the uncarved to perfect intent."*

Face the sun, form the *Lingbao* seal, recite the incantation, and inhale the *qi* of sunlight to blow upon it. Recite again, draw the *qi* of the five directions from the void, and blow upon the mirror to examine it. For essence-*qi* that has taken form and caused harm over years, use this to distinguish the initial coalescence of spectral illusions and the uncarved block from which essence attaches to humans, tracing the source to reveal the truth. For unauthorized shrines and temples, employ the following method to address them.

**Three Spirits Confronting Inquiry Incantation**
*"Shatter, cut, oppose, and block; exchange constellations to deliver control.
Seize the correct and upright; illuminate repentance to return the hearth."*

Form the *Lingbao* seal and blow the *qi* of the northwest upon the mirror to subdue the defiant and obstinate principal spirits, compelling the mad and deluded to manifest bizarre falsehoods. For unauthorized shrines and temples that demand crooked offerings, force them to appear in form and confront the living. If their authenticity remains unverified, proceed with the following incantation.

**Facing the Four Directions Incantation**
*"Thousandfold scrutiny shifts and alters nature to seize conduct; array and arrive to restrain the black conduct.
Shift gaze to distinguish virtue and rectify conduct; tread and shift traces to depart and enable conduct."*

Form the *Lingbao* seal and blow the *qi* of the four directions upon the mirror to discern the truth or falsity of ghostly and demonic entities, verifying the emptiness or reality of malevolent influences. Opening the four directions, their traces become visible.

**Fourfold Discernment and Harmonizing Form Incantation**
*"Exhaust rectitude to harmonize the black; wood scrutinizes to circulate through.
Depart joy to separate and shift; eight severances love profit.
Cut, cut, cut."*

Form the *Lingbao* seal and blow the *qi* of the four directions upon the mirror to govern all demonic kinds that delude humans according to their desires, drawing them into the body to incite misfortune. Discern their forms and shadows to examine and perceive their roots.

**Six Profound Scrutiny of the Yin Incantation**
*"Endure to govern the distant and true to assist the profound; no greed shatters the profound.
Dawn befits arrival at the profound; call the defiled to confront the profound.
Six whites wheel intent through the profound; image shifts to report the profound."*

Form the *Lingbao* seal and blow the *qi* of the north upon the mirror to illuminate obscure and unfathomable mechanisms, making the unseen visible through this method.

**Seven Grades Discerning Ranks Incantation**
*"Open principle’s wondrous palace; eternal flower departs the palace.
Confront the center to calculate the palace; *Yanluo* wondrous palace.
Seize the malevolent to shatter the palace; treasure city departs the palace.
Confront the defiled *Jiaoxiu* to extinguish depletion and eclipse the sound of transgression."*

Form the *Lingbao* seal, recite the incantation, and blow the *qi* of the southeast upon the mirror, then the *qi* of the southwest upon the *yi*. Discern the orthodoxy or heterodoxy of ghosts and spirits, the magnitude of their ranks, and investigate to reveal them.

*The Great Method of the* Lingbao Wuliang Duren Shangjing*, Scroll Thirty-Five, concludes.*
*The Great Method of the* Lingbao Wuliang Duren Shangjing*, Scroll Thirty-Six.*

**Chapter on Dispelling Malevolence and Rescuing from Distress**

The essentials of the great method comprise three systems: first, the recitation of incantations; second, the deployment of talismans; and third, the performance of ritual procedures.

Incantations are the esoteric language of the heavens above. All perfected beings and the myriad spirits respond to their invocation, descending with the *qi*. Talismans are the celestial covenants of the heavens above, by which all perfected beings are summoned and drawn downward. Ritual procedures govern the bureaus of the immortals, where hosts of perfected beings and the hundred spirits each fulfill their duties. Yet they must be summoned by talismans and incantations, called forth to arrive and dispatched to depart. These are the three systems.

There are also four kinds of retribution: first, the retribution of wisdom; second, the retribution of spirit; third, the retribution of intention; and fourth, the retribution of immortality. The retribution of wisdom is the daily growth of wisdom. The retribution of spirit is the penetration and reach of the numinous. The retribution of intention is the uncommon clarity of perception, which leads to the retribution of immortality.

There are seven prohibitions: first, restrain the mouth; second, restrain the eyes; third, restrain the ears; fourth, restrain the hands; fifth, restrain the feet; sixth, restrain the intention; and seventh, restrain the thoughts. If the mouth does not utter curses or filthy speech, then the incantations will communicate with the numinous. If the eyes do not gaze upon filth or defilement, then they may behold the true spirits. If the ears do not listen to lewd sounds, then they may hear the sounds of the method. If the hands do not touch filthy things, then the mudras may communicate with the spirits. If the feet do not tread upon filth or evil, then stepping the *gang* may enable flight. If the intention does not arise in defiled perceptions, then one may summon and attract true immortals. If the thoughts do not arise in disorder, then concentrated contemplation may bring forth the divine luminaries. These are the seven prohibitions.

There are also five taboos: first, avoid holding infants or nursing children, lest the power of the method be obstructed. Second, avoid frivolously approaching the moon goddess, for meddlesome actions often give rise to demonic interference. Third, avoid angering the spirits with violence or disrespect, for the perfected will then depart far away. Fourth, avoid failing to universally cultivate merit, for virtue will not be recorded in the registers of immortality. Fifth, avoid disrespect and lack of faith, for heterodoxy will then mingle with orthodoxy. If one can first clarify the three systems, then the four kinds of retribution, and avoid violating the seven prohibitions, while carefully observing the five taboos, one may enter the wondrous realm of the great method’s mysterious gate.

When scholars practice this great method, they are often harassed by hosts of demons, leading to the failure of their merit and the accrual of transgressions. They should recite the *Incantation of Wisdom of the Golden Portal and Mysterious Origin Dao Lord for Eliminating Ninety-Six Kinds of Heterodoxies and One Hundred Eighty Kinds of Heavenly Demons*:

*"The *qi* of heaven and earth intermingles, giving rise to all manner of demons and perverse spirits.
Ever employ the true Dao to dispel the miasmic vapors.
First, contemplate: no self, no master.
All dharmas are empty; they cannot be mutually transformed.
Is there a single true realm?
Flying demons and ghostly spirits—
know their dwelling places, truly know the expedient means.
Provisionally empty and existent, the nature of dharmas is the banner of principle.
Abiding in profound stillness, without coming or going.
Knowing the true, one knows the demons above.
Knowing the three characteristics, one distinguishes the four kinds of emptiness.
Origin, prosperity, harmony, and constancy—
heterodoxy does not encroach upon orthodoxy.
Those who confront the soldiers in battle, array your ranks and advance!"*

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

For this method, first knock the teeth together twelve times, then recite the incantation in secret without regard to the number of repetitions. All demons will then generate good intentions and press their heads beneath the seat. If one wishes to eliminate them, recite the incantation extensively for many repetitions, and the demons will all flee, dissolving in accordance with the incantation.

**The True Talisman of the Upper Prime’s Refulgent Nine Yang Radiance Fire Bell**

When inscribing talismans, use cinnabar to write on yellow silk, facing south. With the left hand, form the Jade Emperor mudra, recite the esoteric name of the Mysterious Perfected, also called the *Lingqi* Spirit-Writing of the Jade Tone, or the *Zudao Xuan Zhen*. Light incense, concentrate the spirit, dip the cinnabar brush, and draw the nine yang radiance of the sun down onto the paper and brush. Then, in accordance with the method, proceed step by step to inscribe, without missing the sequence.

This talisman governs wood sprites, stone spirits, red demons, and inauspicious monsters that disturb and harm the people and their possessions. Inscribe the talisman with the iron cinnabar script, then impress it with the fire bell seal. Bury it a foot and some inches beneath the soil of the original location, and the demonic spirits will conceal their traces, ascending to be delivered as true Dao beings.

If flocks of birds gather and defile the blessed land of forests and ridges, one should petition the Vermilion Radiance Red Emperor of the Southern Marchmount and dispatch a talisman to expel them. This talisman may also be swallowed or worn by people.

To inscribe this talisman, first write the characters for "fire bell," then draw three vertical strokes above the "fire bell" characters, reciting the incantation from *"Yan jing"* to *"yi zhi."* Next, weave five horizontal strokes above the three vertical lines, reciting the incantation from *"Po lian"* to *"fei yang."* Then, turn nineteen times to the lower right of the five horizontal strokes, reciting the incantation from *"San guan"* to *"qi xing."* Next, curve and turn three strokes upward in the form of three dots, sequentially placing them in the center above the talisman, with the brush tail extending to the left, reciting the incantation from *"Dong ru"* to *"Xu huang."* Then, write the character *"chi"* at the lower left of the talisman, extending the final stroke, reciting *"Hao tian you chi."* Next, draw two strokes extending to the right, reciting the incantation from *"Liu jin"* to *"wu qiang."* Then, inscribe two strokes at the top of the talisman, and recite: *"Swiftly, swiftly, swiftly!"* Finally, write the character *"zhan"* within the final stroke of the *"chi"* character.

At the proper position in the ritual, make the petition, saying:

*"To the Primordial Lord of the Long-Life Great Lord of the Qi Clan, this humble disciple [Name] respectfully invokes the true *qi*, and earnestly summons the Flying Celestial Red *Qi* Emperor Lord of the Flowing Metal Fire Bell, the assisting officials Wen and Xiu, and the radiant Shu Guang Yao, to clearly dissolve demonic influences and seal them through capture."*

After the petition, draw the nine yang radiance of the purple light of the sun, and blow it onto the cinnabar and the brush, each once. Then, calm the mind, sit upright, light incense, quiet the spirit, and concentrate on the Vermilion Emperor of the Upper Palace of the Cinnabar Numinous. Exhale nine crimson rays of light into the crown of the disciple’s head, descending to irrigate the divine palace, penetrating and illuminating like the sun. Next, visualize the Three Terraces and Canopy stars within the *niwan* palace, their light suffusing the entire form. Then, imagine two spirits of fiery essence within the eyes, each three inches tall, clad in vermilion robes and wearing red caps, exhaling two beams of fire from their mouths that emerge from the eyes and merge with the light of the Three Terraces stars at the tip of the brush. Hold the breath and inscribe the talisman, swiftly forming the mudra at the end and blowing *qi* onto the talisman. If inscribed with nine-times refined cinnabar, it can revive the dead and animate corpses.

For this method, when the master personally absorbs the *qi* of the sun, at sunrise form the Jade Emperor mudra with both hands, close the eyes, and face the sun with palms joined. Recite the incantation once, then draw the *qi* in through the mouth and nose, swallowing it nine times, and with intention send it down to the cinnabar field. Repeat this for two sets of nine, three sets of nine, up to nine sets of nine.

Then recite the Solar Lord’s incantation:

*"Solar soul, vermilion radiance,
Illumining green with crimson sheen.
Returning auroras, scarlet youths,
Mysterious flames in whirlwind form."*

When the incantation is complete, recite again:

*"Yù zhēn lí."*

Absorb *qi* as before and swallow it down to the Cinnabar Origin. Perform this practice before noon.

For the *qi* of the Great Yin, proceed as before, but only from the ninth day after the waxing moon to the sixteenth or seventeenth day before the waning moon. Absorb nineteen measures of *qi*, and cease thereafter.

After reciting the general incantation, recite the Lunar Lord’s incantation:

*"Lunar spirit, warm and serene,
Fragrant and lustrous, veiled in void.
Graceful and empty, numinous and bright,
Flourishing splendor, jadelike glow.
Pure golden essence, luminous and refined,
Radiant countenance, sharp as a hair’s tip."*

When the incantation is complete, recite again:

*"Jié hēng kǎn."*

Absorb *qi* as before and swallow it down to the Cinnabar Origin.

For the *qi* of the Celestial Pivot, proceed as before, facing due north. Recite the general incantation and absorb *qi* to completion. Then recite the Celestial Pivot incantation:

*"Celestial Pivot, Great Sage,
Sun and Moon’s honored star.
True *qi* descends and infuses,
Prolonging life and enhancing vitality.
[...]
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!"*

Absorb *qi* as before and swallow it down to the Cinnabar Origin.

Upon completing the absorption of the Three Lights’ *qi*, knock the teeth nine times and withdraw. After a hundred days and nights of practice, the room will be filled with light, and coughing will emit divine radiance capable of animating beings. After two hundred days, the true elixir of the sun, moon, and stars will coalesce in the cinnabar field. When incantations are recited over objects, they will appear as if dyed in true crimson. For healing and talisman-work, the true *qi* blown upon them will bring immediate peace.

To administer *qi* for healing, have the patient inhale it in a receptive state, and they will naturally feel warmth in the cinnabar field. The efficacy of the practice will be self-evident.

Master Liu Tian Shi Hun Kang said: When inscribing talismans, recite the incantations of the Solar Lord, Lunar Lord, and Celestial Pivot three times each. Absorb *qi* and blow it onto the tip of the brush, then face the southeast to inscribe. Upon completing the talisman, recite each incantation three more times, infusing it into the talisman.

**The Divine Seal of Flowing Gold and Fire Bell**
In the Southern Palace resides Han, Controller of the Fire Bureau, where the vermilion script of flowing fire is kept—a divine seal of golden truth. It gathers the effulgent *qi* of cinnabar clouds and condenses the crimson script of the Three Lights, known as the *Divine Seal of Cinnabar Heaven’s Flowing Gold and Fire Bell*.

Its cinnabar splendor mirrors the sun, its golden fire blazes with brilliance. It summons dragons and invokes thunder, refines souls to ascend as immortals, severs water spirits, dispels yin specters, cures disasters and plagues, delivers from calamity and wards off illness. It burns the Nine Uglies and subdues the Five Demons.

Attached to this seal are three thousand *qi*-attendant cinnabar officials, six hundred Fire Bell generals, and one hundred twenty Golden Light divine youths. They follow the seal’s commands, heeding its authority—this is the master decree of the Red Emperor and the fire mandate of Lord Han.

Concealed within the Cinnabar Flame Bureau and the Radiant Terrace, it is inscribed with deep red jade and sealed with the *Primal Illumination of the Numinous Void*. Every three hundred years, the seal is bestowed upon the officials of the Southern Palace to assist in the transformation and merit-making of the Lower Prime. It is received in the heart and must not be shown to the unworthy. Those who recklessly reveal it will be punished by demotion to the left bureau for judgment.

The seal measures two *cun* and one *fen* on each side, with a thickness of seven *fen*. It is carved from the southern branch of a divine peach tree from the sacred land, on a *bǐng*- or *dīng*-day of the fire phase. Have a craftsman shape it, then bury it in the southeast corner of a tranquil dwelling, seven *cun* deep. Offer one stick of incense daily upon the burial site, perform three bows, and withdraw without uttering a prayer.

On the seventh day, retrieve it and wash away the soil with flowing water. Bathe it in incense smoke, then fill its grooves with true cinnabar. Place it in a cinnabar-yellow silk pouch and secure it behind the elbow. On a *dīng*-day at the *dīng*-hour, face the *dīng* direction and pace the Fire Bell *gāng*. Visualize the true forms of six jade maidens.

Recite the incantation:

*"[...] command, [...] seize,
Enter the seal—swiftly, swiftly, as the Fire Bell seizes!"*

Recite this six times, each time absorbing *qi* and exhaling onto the seal. For seven days, abstain from pork and all pungent or foul-smelling foods.

On the seventh day’s completion, at the *jiǎ*-hour of the eighth day (a *jiǎ*-day), face the *jiǎ* direction and pace the Fire Bell *gāng*. Visualize the true forms of the six *Jiǎ* divine generals.

Recite the incantation:

*"[...], [...] seize."*

Place it within the seal—swiftly, swiftly, as the Fire Command seizes.

Recite the incantation six times, each time drawing *qi* and blowing onto the seal. For two days, abstain from the five flavors of vegetables, fruits, and oils.

On the third day, a *bǐng*-day, pace the Fire Bell *gāng* toward the *bǐng* direction. Face the sun, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the sunlight covering the seal, its rays spiraling ninefold around the seal’s grooves.

Recite the incantation:

*"Hū! Bearer Child, summon the radiance of Yùyí.
The Crimson Emperor floats in the cavernous void, the Southern Gate spouts brilliance.
Jade eyes gleam, ten thousand evils sink into obscurity.
Your servant obeys the master’s command, daring not to delay or disobey.
Ninefold light-qi coils, the *dīng* and *jiǎ* spirits follow in attendance.
By the Primal Sovereign’s oral decree, yin-qi dissolves into mist."*

Recite this eighty-one times, drawing *qi* eighty-one times and spraying it onto the seal. On a *chén*-day at the *xū*-hour, pace the Fire Bell *gāng*, face the Dipper, and click the teeth seven times. Looking upward, recite:

*"Táluó Yùmiǎo, pure light of the Dipper’s dawn.
Divine Child of the Great One, Sovereign of the Kuí Gāng’s primal power.
Mysterious *qi* of the Primal Sovereign nurtures the seal to commune with the true.
Utmost numinous, utmost sagely—encounter evil and it must respond.
Fire Bell’s golden light, rebuke and sever demonic vapors.
The Kuí’s radiant *gāng*-qi shatters ten thousand ills.
One seal brings forth fortune—primal, prosperous, steadfast, and true."*

Recite this forty-nine times, drawing *qi* forty-nine times and blowing onto the seal. Await the intended effect: whether to seal a mountain and summon spirits, issue summons to dragons and sever demons, pacify waters and cross waves, or cure plagues and dispel afflictions.

Press the Fire Bell seal with the left hand, pace the Fire Bell *gāng*, and face south. Visualize the heart’s fire as a thread entering the seal’s grooves, spiraling ninefold around the seal’s perforations, like a net of crimson light. Upon completion, click the teeth nine times.

Recite the incantation:

*"Lesser novice, your servant [Name], respectfully invokes the Lord of the Southern Primordial *Qi*, the Eternal Life Sovereign, the Great Spirit Hàn Jūn Sīmǎ.
Descend with true *qi* into your servant’s seal.
Summon and descend with the *qi*: the Eight Radiant Gods of Golden Truth and Jade Light, the Fire Bell Generals, the Luminous Divine Child, the Three *Qi* Celestial Officers, Wénxiù and Shūguāng, to govern by the seal’s command.
Resplendent heavenly might, incinerate and scour demonic ills.
Hurl fire to strike ahead, let the ringing bells charge behind.
Wind pursues, fire attacks—whatever the seal imprints is prosperous and true.
By the Supreme Emperor’s decree, the divine ministers carry it out.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Fire Bell’s law commands!"*

Upon finishing, draw the pure *qi* of the Upper Palace into the mouth and spread it over the seal, then imprint with it. The seal may be pressed onto sand or stone and buried in water or earth; or imprinted on silk to be swallowed or worn; or used to seal clay; or applied to afflicted areas. In all cases, no more than three applications are needed for resolution.

Avoid impure *qi* contaminating the seal—if it does, the seal will crack and lose its efficacy.

**Seal-Imprinting Mudra:**
From the root of the right hand’s middle finger to the *lí* trigram, then from the *lí* trigram to beneath the nail, lift the flesh into the seal.

Beyond its talismanic use, the Northern Emperor’s Fire Bell seal can also treat cold-induced *qi* pain and similar ailments.

**Method:**
Pinch the *lí* trigram with the left hand (the middle joint of the middle finger, also called the "Sun Sovereign Mudra"), hold the seal in the right hand, and stand two paces away from the recipient. With the seal’s design facing them, declare your dharma rank and invoke the Lord of the Primordial *Qi*, the Great Eternal Life Sovereign. For the recipient’s ailment, beseech true *qi* and solemnly summon the Red and Black Emperor Lords of the Flying Bells and Radiant Pleiades, their attendant officers Wénxiù and Shūguāng, and the luminous seal that subjugates demons.

Draw in the sun’s rays to permeate the heart, blend them into one, then exhale through the nose, threading the *qi* through the seal and coiling it around the recipient three or four times before stopping.

Do not place the seal in dust or handle it roughly, lest you offend the true *qi*. If violated, the attendant officers will not descend, and all efforts in visualization will be in vain.

The left-hand pinch of the *lí* trigram refers to the middle joint of the middle finger, also called the "Sun Sovereign Mudra." Many texts mistakenly use *chén* as the solar mudra, unaware that *chén* represents the Celestial Stem. The yellow *qi* and yang essence nurture the hun-soul and penetrate the void; refining the three *qi* into clarity is why *lí* is used as the solar mudra.

When holding the seal in the right hand for practice, ensure movements are deliberate and unhurried, lest the divine *qi* be startled or scattered. Avoid mimicking shamans to prevent ridicule from the vulgar.

Visualize the sun’s rays coiling around the recipient’s body in threefold layers—hence "coiling three or four times."

**Fire Bell *Gāng*:**
Eradicates great harm.

In the world, there are mad and perverse ghosts and spirits—divide and destroy them. Those that linger after death are ghosts. Those that attach to objects are spirits. Those that deviate from the true Way are demons. Those that arise from the four births and bring calamity are monsters. Those that manifest as baleful omens are anomalies.

If mountain specters, giant foxes, great serpents, or long dragons harm the living, erect the **Three Heavens General Qi Altar**. Have two persons each hold a *hu* of ash, beginning from the *qián* direction, and spread it left and right to encircle the altar once, forming a square six *chi* across. Outside the altar, arrange seven piles of fire, and fill jars with water. At the six daily periods, ascend the altar, wield the sword, and recite the *Divine Lord’s Mandate to Sweep Away All Inauspiciousness* incantation: *"From the Thirty-Second Heaven, to the ranks of the Upper Clarity..."* Within seven days, the harm will be struck down by celestial spirits and cast into the altar. With the sword, dispatch them and cast them into flowing water.

For minor demons and petty monsters, omit fire and water. Instead, spread ash within the altar and inscribe the characters *yán yóu*. Circumambulate the altar at the six periods, reciting the *Sweeping Annihilation* incantation. Within three days, the demon will be imprisoned in the altar, leaving traces or appearing in form. Then invoke the celestial spirits of the altar to bind and send it to the Northern Heaven for punishment.

To fell demonic trees or perverse shrines, encircle them with ash, inscribe the *Sweeping Annihilation* incantation, and place it in the southeast. Silently recite the *Tenfold Invocation*, draw the *qi* of the Heavenly Gate, and project it with the **Jade Clarity Mudra**. Within ten days, celestial thunder will shatter them. For water-washed spring caves, inscribe the incantation on stone and sink it; if it does not sink, recite the incantation as before. Within seven days, dragons and water spirits will be expelled. Further strike them with talismans for immediate effect.

Inscribe the characters *yán yóu* and trace them with the right hand using the **Jade Clarity Mudra**, employing the second finger—no written memorials are needed. If the altar is built of earth, it is even more potent than one on level ground. In urgent cases, do not wait for the altar’s completion.

**Three Heavens General Qi Altar**
*Yán yóu*
*Yán* is the courtyard that binds ghosts. *Yóu* is the chamber that imprisons them. Together, they restrain and control ghosts and spirits. Take one *dǒu* of ash, write the two characters in cinnabar on yellow paper, and place them at the ash’s center. The demonic ghosts and spirits will be captured and subdued within. Alternatively, sink it in water as a water prison or place it in fire as a fire prison—transformations are at your discretion.

For setting up the prison, recite the incantation:
*"Courtyard that binds ghosts, chamber that imprisons them.
Ghosts and demons defy the true—seize and imprison them.
Transformations arise naturally; let none linger."*
Recite the incantation while holding the **Jade Clarity Mudra**, draw the *qi* of the eastern direction, and blow it onto the talisman and into the prison. The remaining procedures follow the *Rite for Dispelling Calamity and Averting Disaster*.

**Dispelling Fire Demons**
When the dead become ghostly beings, they become drought demons. Dogs born with camel-like forms are called fire demons. When clouds array as crimson mist, *qi* swells with scorching heat, and winds roar like galloping horses, fire disasters arise. Hold the *kǎn* trigram, dye black silk with ink, and bind it in five coils while facing north. Visualize the Water Star’s constellation with five streams of azure *qi*, draw them in through the nose, hold the breath for five cycles, and recite the incantation:
*"Child of Metal, I inform you.
Fire overcomes the mother—her child rescues her.
Swiftly fly and scatter, forming rivers and pools.
Seas, rivers, dwellings—fire extinguished, smoke dispersed.
The essence of the crimson demon, buried ten thousand feet deep.
Hasten! As the *Statutes of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy* command."*
Recite the incantation five times in haste, then exhale toward the direction of the fire demon. Instantly, the conflagration ceases, and the fire demon is cast down and destroyed.

**Quelling Water Monsters**
When dark mists arise violently, clouds appear reddish-yellow, and *qi* surges like smoke, fierce winds, lightning, and thunder will follow, and water monsters will stir. Or in rivers and seas, when dark clouds and black *qi* appear, great winds will damage things. First perform the **Fire Bell Rite**, hasten the **Four Mountains Mudra**, and from the *xū* position, circumambulate the Dipper to *chén*. Hold the **Upper Clarity Mudra** and mark it with cinnabar. Bind it with red silk in three coils, hold it firmly, face south, and stand with it atop the head. Visualize the Primordial Heavenly Worthy in the *níwán* palace, silently recite the *Great Brahma Hidden Words* ten times, then shift to the **Jade Clarity Mudra**, face south, and visualize the Mars Star’s rays like fire. Draw them in through the nose and hold the breath for three cycles. Recite the incantation:
*"Crimson imperial *qi*, spirit of samādhi.
By the Primordial Worthy’s decree, the water essence collapses."*
After the invocation, exhale toward the clouds three times. The water essence will fall to earth, and wind and thunder will not harm things.

**Six Ding Talisman for Slaying Water Monsters**
Use a square brick or stone of any size, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar, and recite the incantation:
*"Great spirits of the Six Ding, jade maidens of the Six Ding.
By celestial talisman and mandate, slay and sever the monstrous beings.
Gouge out their eyes, sever their claws, take their brains, split their bellies.
Hasten! As the *Numinous Treasure Talisman Mandate* commands."*
Hold the **Jade Clarity Mudra**, draw the *qi* of the current *ding* direction, and blow it onto the talisman before casting it.

**Six Jia Talisman for Dispelling Curses**
Inscribe in cinnabar on yellow paper, hold the **Jade Clarity Mudra**, and recite the incantation:
*"Eight thousand beings of the upper world, four generals holding the earth below.
Officers and soldiers of the Three and Five dispel evil ghosts; boys of the Four and Six guard your body.
On your left, the Azure Dragon; on your right, the White Tiger.
Above, the Vermilion Bird; below, the Dark Warrior.
Before you, the Merit Clerk; behind you, the Registrar.
If there are curses, return them to their master—if they do not leave at once, the Heavenly Axe awaits.
Hasten! As the Primordial Heavenly Worthy decrees."*
Draw the *qi* of the current *jiǎ* direction and blow it onto the talisman. Wear one talisman, burn one in the central courtyard, grind one into ash and mix it with water to sprinkle throughout the room, and combine one with a black plum and three *cùn* of licorice, decoct them into pills, and swallow. The cursed objects will all be vomited out.

**Vermilion Lake Talisman for Driving Away Locusts**
Use eight peachwood planks, each two *chǐ* four *cùn* long and three *cùn* wide, and inscribe eight talismans in orpiment. Offer tea, wine, and three portions of crimson silk to the **Perfected Lord of Myriad Responses of the Southern Direction** and the **Vermilion Lake Envoy**. He is thirty thousand *zhàng* tall, with red eyes and scorched hair, clad in a crimson robe and scarlet skirt, a cinnabar crown and vermilion shoes, his body wreathed in ten thousand *zhàng* of firelight. In his hand, he wields a samādhi trident wheel, riding the *qi* of the Vermilion Cavern and Vermilion Bird, followed by ten thousand birds.

Invoke thus:
By the decree of the Primordial Beginning’s sacred mandate and the Jade Emperor’s edict, expel and exterminate all vermin and locust plagues. I now summon thee—execute this command without fail. Parents and progeny of locusts, depart swiftly and linger not. Should any insect defy this order, it shall be reduced to dust. *Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes of the Most High!*

Then draw *qi* and blow upon the talisman, bury it with a sword at the eight directions, three *chǐ* deep into the earth. The locusts shall scatter and perish at once, the crops preserved whole, accruing merit for the salvation of the world.

**Upper Register: Talisman of the Three Pure Realms**
**Incantation for the Talisman’s Decree:**
Reverently invoke the Most High Mysterious August One, the Perfected Lord of the Wondrous Dao, the Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder, the Immortal Palace’s Chief Minister, and the august deities of the Five Peaks. Descend swiftly with true *qi* into this talisman of mine. Wherever the talisman’s decree reaches, demons die and men find peace. *Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Samādhi True Talisman’s decree!*

For this talisman, form the mudrā of the Three Clarities, inscribe it in vermilion upon yellow paper, and blow upon it with the *qi* of the Heavenly Gate. Further, recite the following incantation over the talisman, blow upon it with the *qi* of the five directions, burn it to ash, and mix with water. Administer thrice daily for all ailments, and recovery shall be immediate.

**Middle Register: Talisman of Auxiliary Protection**
**Incantation for the Talisman’s Decree:**

**Incantation for the Talisman’s Decree:**
Humbly invoke Marshal Xu Laizhong, the Great Marshal of Pursuit and Capture on the Cloud Path of the Nine Heavens of Highest Clarity, along with Jiang Chenyuan, Zhai Shining, and Zhao Ziyu. Act in strict accordance with the talisman’s command: proceed forth with the talisman, seize and subdue demonic entities, and restore health and tranquility. *Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Statutes and Decrees of the Primordial Descent of Highest Clarity!*

Inscribe this talisman in black upon yellow paper. For each use, prepare eight talismans: one large talisman, to be burned with gold coins within the main gate; and seven smaller talismans. Burn them to ash, stir into heart-extracted decoction, and administer. The response shall be extraordinary.

**Lower Register: Talismans of the Five Emperors**
Humbly invoke the True Lords of the Five Dipper Stars, the Direct Talismanic Deities of the Five Directions and Five Emperors, and the Officials of the Thirty-Two Heavens. By the august mandate of the Supreme Emperor, let the ceaseless winds and fires reverse corpse-infestation and return the dead to peace. Let souls and spirits be harmonized, and the myriad spirits find repose. *Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Statutes and Decrees!*

For this talisman, first recite the *Xuanyun Incantation*, then form the mudrā of Jade Clarity, inscribe in vermilion, and inhale the *qi* of the Heavenly Gate to blow upon it. Afterward, recite the following incantation, draw the *qi* of the southeast, and swallow with pure water. This talisman averts all misfortune and cures all ailments.

**Method for Salvation with Millet**
On a *jiǎ* or *yǐ* day, facing east, purchase one *shēng* of glutinous millet. Upon returning home, place it before the sacred altar. Remove all dust and husks, selecting one *gě* of pure millet, and place it in a clean tray. Beginning on a *yín* or *mǎo* day, expose it to the stars, moon, and night dew for twelve nights. If any night is incomplete, make up for it in the following cycle. Once the millet has absorbed sufficient *qi*, choose an evening when red clouds or purple clouds resembling burning flames appear in the four directions—this marks the Celestial Worthy’s procession. Sincerely burn incense and bow to the four directions, then place the millet in the open air upon a table. First recite the *Millet Incantation* ten times, then the *Incantation for Deliverance of the Ten Directions* ten times, followed by the *Incantation of the Ten Great Divine Powers* ten times, visualizing the *qi* entering the millet. Next, recite the *Great Brahmā’s Hidden Words* thirty-two times, inhaling the *qi* of the Thirty-Two Heavens to blow upon it. Then recite the *Divine Duke’s Incantation* ten times, inhaling the *qi* of the east to blow upon it. Store this millet in a vessel of gold or jade, then bow to the ten directions and withdraw.

When encountering any illness, take ten grains of millet, recite each incantation once as before, inhale *qi* to blow upon them, and have the afflicted consume them with plain noodles facing east, swallowing with fragrant water.

**Millet Incantation**
Herein, the Primordial Beginning suspends a precious pearl, vast as a grain of millet, invulnerable to all harm.

**Incantation for Deliverance of the Ten Directions**
The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounds the scripture once, that all may attain longevity.

**Incantation of the Ten Great Divine Powers**
The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounds the scripture once. From the boundless and immeasurable ranks of the Perfected Great Divine Powers of the east, to the completion of the tenth recitation, all arrive as one.

**Divine Duke’s Incantation**
The Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Emperors, ascend in ordered ranks to Highest Clarity.

The aforementioned precious pearl is deployed to suppress demonic hordes in mountains and rivers, and to quell the hundred specters and malevolent spirits gathering in haunted dwellings. When *qi* circulation falters, stellar constellations misalign, sun and moon lose their clarity, pestilence spreads, warfare erupts on all sides, or great floods and fires arise, recite this incantation over the millet at dawn or dusk, and cast it upon the afflicted site.

**Precious Register for Breaking Curses**
In all applications of the Precious Register, the correct *qi* of the Five Phases leads as the root of the Five Phases’ correct *qi*, while the rest serve as its function. To cultivate and attain penetrating vision, one must first employ this Precious Register, petitioning the Great Divine Marshals of *Dīng* and *Jiǎ*, and the Four Direct Deities, before use, to ensure communion with the numinous and entry into sageliness.

**Precious Register of the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct of Jade Clarity for Breaking Curses**
Petitioning [location omitted]:
[Text omitted for yin days] [Text omitted for yang days]
*Dào* Treasure, *Fǎ* Treasure, by the sacred decree of True Martiality, expel perverse *qi* or banish malevolent spirits; let true *qi* abide and correct *qi* reside here.
Great General of the Encompassing Heavens, summon the Radiant Ghost King to act in accordance with the decree.

**Precious Register of the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct of Highest Clarity for Breaking Curses**
Petitioning [location], to be enacted in accordance with the method and command.
Respectfully submitted in the year of *Tàisuì* [Year], [Month], [Day], [Hour].
Submitted by the Dharma-ranked official, [Your Name].

**Perfected of the Descent of the Jade Spring of Highest Clarity**
**Perfected Sovereign of the Highest Clarity’s Retinue**
**Perfected of the Conduct of Highest Clarity**

**Envelope:**
**Precious Register of the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct of Highest Clarity for Breaking Curses**
Petitioning [Location]
Respectfully sealed by the Dharma-ranked official, [Your Name]

When inscribing a Precious Register, first burn incense, strike the teeth twenty-four times, and form the Mudra of the Five Peaks and Three Passes with both hands. Recite the Comprehensive Mantra of the Numinous Treasure, invoking from the Thirty-Two Heavens and Thirty-Two Emperors up to the Perfected of Highest Clarity. Draw in the upright *qi*, circulate the mudra, and blow upon the paper. Then, with the left hand forming the Mudra of the Five Peaks, trace the text while reciting the mantra, pressing firmly with the middle joint of the middle finger.

Recite the Mantra of the Stellar Spirits, drawing in the northern *qi* and blowing it into the water. Next, recite the Mantra of the Primordial Heaven, again drawing in the northern *qi* and blowing it into the water. Recite the Mantra of the Heavenly Perfected, drawing in the northern *qi* and blowing it into the water. Recite the Mantra of the Heavenly Ford, saying:

*"Great Perfected of the Heavenly Ford, guard the divine fluid and purify the spirit. With one recitation, sever the ghosts; forever repel the demonic essence."*

Draw in the northern *qi* and exhale it into the water. Then recite the Mantra of the True *Qi*, saying:

*"Stellar Spirit of the True Warrior, sever the malevolent and banish pestilence. Water of true yang, forever dispel all ills beyond ten thousand leagues."*

After reciting the five mantras, offer incense again, recite the Mantra of the Great One, grind the ink, and draw in the *qi* of the five directions to blow upon it. Grind the ink forty-nine times to the left and forty-nine times to the right, reciting one mantra per grind. Invoke the names of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Yang Dipper, the Yin Dipper, and the Central Dipper, drawing in the *qi* of the five directions and blowing it into the inkstone.

Hold the brush in the left hand and form the Twelve Scripts with the right, reciting the Mantra of the Five Peaks for Upholding the Body:

*"As this disciple receives the *qi* once each year, even Heaven cannot cover me, nor Earth bear me. Those who strike me shall die; those who collide with me shall perish. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!"*

Then, beginning with the *mao* script, press firmly:
*"Red apricot, black ink of *chou*, true grinding of *dui*, stockings of *li*, Numinous Treasure at the middle finger’s center."*

Press firmly and recite the Mantra of the Five Peaks and Three Passes:

*"Red apricot, black ink, true grinding, stockings, Numinous Treasure. Arise and transform, seize alone, illuminate and clarify, accomplish the work. Gather the hun-souls, seize the work, gather the hun-souls. Swift messengers of the eight directions, celestial spirits and earthly deities, the myriad numina unite in accord. By the decree of Heaven and Earth, by the command of the Radiant Heavenly Emperor!"*

Recite the three phrases. Upon completion, release the mudra and blow a breath of *qi* onto the paper. Press the middle script of the middle finger as before, without releasing it. Hold the brush in the right hand, position it three inches from the mouth, and secretly recite the Three Heavenly Taboos. Draw in the blue, yellow, and white *qi* of Heaven and blow upon the brush. Then inscribe the register, writing the Six Ding and Six Jia spirits on the reverse for major matters.

On yang days, inscribe the first four Direct Spirits; on yin days, the latter four. On yang days, write the Taboo of the Southern Dipper; on yin days, the Taboo of the Northern Dipper. If the register’s method includes two characters, for exorcising demonic afflictions, write the two characters of the True Talisman. For major matters, write the two characters of the Northern Emperor. For the remaining characters, recite them aloud without inscribing them on the paper, marking them with empty dots.

For example, if dispelling malevolent *qi* or calming illness, say: *"Seize the black malevolent *qi*, extinguish the illness—thus it is."* Malevolent *qi* refers to locusts, hail, drought, or flood—all forms of malevolent *qi*. For demonic afflictions, say: *"Seize the demonic affliction."* Demonic afflictions include malevolent spirits, ghosts, or pestilence.

Then, according to the petitioner’s submitted document, carefully inscribe the decree. For exorcising demonic afflictions, write: *"Swiftly summon the Orthodox Spirits of the Bureau of Destiny, together with the Six Ding and Six Jia within this register, the Four Direct Messengers, to heal the suffering and sever the demonic afflictions. Swiftly restore peace and well-being, manifesting the response in accordance with the decree."*

Then inscribe the year, month, day, and hour of the submission, followed by: *"Submitted by the Dharma-ranked official [Your Name], reverently carrying out the decree as recorded."*

On a Six Jia day, face east in the proper position and sit. Between the *chou* and *yin* hours, form the Mudra of the Five Peaks with both hands, pressing firmly on the middle script of the middle finger. Recite the Mantra of the Five Peaks for Upholding the Body three times, draw in the eastern *qi*, rinse the mouth with saliva, and swallow it. On a Six Jia day, the turbid *qi* is exhausted, and the register may then be enacted.

After inscribing the register, recite each mantra once more from the beginning. Gaze upward to the vast sky, draw in a breath of *qi*, and release both the breath and the mudra onto the register. Immediately affix the seal and seal the envelope, ensuring no one sees it. After sealing the corners, offer incense again and bow nine times toward the Northern Dipper. Secretly memorialize:

*"The Dharma-ranked official [Your Name], in accordance with the petition submitted by [Petitioner’s Name] regarding [Matter], now seeks to enact [Method]. Humbly beseeching the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct of Highest Clarity, the Perfected Sovereign of the Highest Clarity’s Retinue, the Perfected of the Descent of the Jade Spring of Highest Clarity, the Nine August Perfected Lords of the Northern Dipper, the Six Bureau Perfected Lords of the Southern Dipper, the Four Sage Marshal Perfected Lords, to transmit this petition to the Three Heavenly Golden Gates and report it to the Heavenly Ministries and Bureaus. Dispatch the great spirits of the Six Ding and Six Jia, the Four Direct Messengers of Wind, Clouds, *Qi*, and Rain, the Jade Script Spirit Lords, the Generals of the Encompassing Heavens, the Radiant Ghost King, the Eight Script Lords of the Numinous Treasure, the Nine Ugly Emperor Lords, and the Immortal Bureaus of the Numinous Treasure to act in accordance with the register and swiftly manifest the response."*

The official reverently awaits the celestial grace. Respectfully conclude, then recite the Three Heavenly Hidden Taboos one hundred twenty times, drawing in the three-colored *qi* of the Three Heavens and blowing it upon the register. Bow nine times in the heart. Retire, then burn the register along with twenty-one pieces of gold paper and three cups of pure tea in a blazing fire, together with the Four Direct Spirit Lords’ warrants, and await the response.

For praying for rain, report to the Dragon Spirits governing the four seasons’ rainfall, the Earl of Wind, the Master of Rain, the Duke of Thunder, the Mother of Lightning, and the Dragon Spirits of the local rivers, lakes, and deep pools. The method for praying for clear skies is the same.

For addressing locusts, weapons, crabs, rats, or other pests, report to the Silkworm Father and Grain Mother, the Earth Spirits and Grain Spirits, the Spirits of the Three, Seven, and Nine Wildernesses, the Mountain and River Spirits, the Spirits of Forests and Trees, the Earth Spirits, Water Spirits, and Mountain Spirits, and the Orthodox Spirits of the local temples. Swiftly drive away and expel the harmful creatures from the local area, causing them to disperse immediately. Protect the local fields and crops, ensuring the five grains grow in harmony with yin and yang, without damage or loss.

Upon the completion of tasks and the establishment of merit, report the achievements to the Three Heavens and advance by three ranks.

For addressing water monsters, report to the local Dragon Spirits in charge, the Great Spirits of the Six Dings, the Great Spirits of the Six Jias, the Duke of Thunder, the Mother of Lightning, and the Sagely Host of the Five Thunders. Urgently summon them to swiftly capture and restrain the harmful entity, securely imprison it, and promptly dispatch it to the Heavenly Prison to be punished according to the law.

If the stellar lodges deviate from their courses, the sun and moon lose their clarity, or comets arise, humbly beseech the Three Masters and Perfected Ones, the Sagely Beings of the Three Heavens, the Southern and Northern Dippers, the Spirit Lords of the Five Stars, and the Celestial Bureaucracy to memorialize the True Lord Han Jun, the Venerable Master, to regulate the celestial pivot, correct the heavenly divisions, and prevent malevolent qi from encroaching upon the stellar palaces. Thereby, cut off the malevolent qi at once, allow auspicious omens to flourish daily, safeguard the state and its households, ensure peace and quell warfare, and prevent the rise of bandits, floods, or fires, all by the grace of the sagely favor.

If the four seasons lose their proper order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, this falls under the jurisdiction of the Five Emperors. Humbly beseech the Venerable Emperor of the Mysterious Origin, the Five Emperors of the Five Directions—the Green Emperor Gou Mang of the East, the Red Emperor Zhu Rong of the South, the White Emperor Ru Shou of the West, the Black Emperor Xuan Ning of the North, the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan of the Center—along with the August Sacred Mother of the Earth, the Great Spirits of the Eight Nodal Points, the Twenty-Four Qi, and the Seventy-Two Seasonal Divinities. Humbly implore their sagely compassion to rectify the seasons: restrain the scorching yang, temper the stern qi with warmth and clarity, spread harmonious qi in spring, ensure the growth of all things, halt the severity of frost and snow, usher in harmonious qi, gradually dispel epidemics, and prevent the intrusion of malevolent qi.

For banditry, report to the Great Spirits of the Five Marchmounts, the Earth Spirits of the Nine Provinces, the Spirit Lords of the Great Unity and the Nine Bases, and the Orthodox Spirits of the local City Gods and Earth Shrines. Request each to dispatch their legions of yin soldiers to defend the city walls and protect the people. If bandits or rebels grow powerful, acting lawlessly and rampantly—flooding waters or setting fires—capture the ringleaders, bind their three hun and seven po, and send them to the Heavenly Prison. There, subject them to trials thrice daily, compelling them to reform and return to goodness, causing their malice to vanish like melting ice or crumbling tiles, and restoring peace to the realm.

**Incantation of the Samādhi True Fire for Consecrating Water to Subdue Evil:**
Fire Bell Emperor, Fire Bell Lord, Fire Bell Spirit, Fire Bell General, Fire Bell Youth, Lord of Mars, Lords of Bing and Ding, driving the Fire Chariot, riding the Fire Wheel.
Gentle and warm, yielding earth and firm heaven.

The Qi of the Nine Perfections gathers and seizes inauspicious forces.
The Samādhi True Fire radiates light across ten thousand li.
It illumines heaven and earth, blazing gloriously in the eight directions.
Rivers and seas boil and surge; demons and specters hide in concealment.
The Southern Dipper descends with qi; the Samādhi streams forth its light.
It refines the embryo and transforms the substance, forging the po and invigorating the hun.
Ten thousand demons perish and fall, borne away on rising smoke.

**Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees!**

**Ancestral Dao Mysterious Perfection Incantation:**
Ancestral Dao, Mysterious Perfection.

For this method, select a *wu-wu* or *bing-wu* day, or commence on a *wu-chen* or *wu-xu* day. At the hour following dawn, face the sun and recite the incantation ten times daily, drawing in a breath of solar qi and swallowing it, without regard to the number of repetitions. If the morning hour is missed, at noon face south, visualize the solar qi in abundance, bow in reverence, recite the incantation ten times per cycle, and swallow the solar orb once, without limit to the number of cycles. One myriad repetitions is optimal.

Upon completion of the practice, take water and fill a vessel of bronze or iron. Facing the sun, recite the two preceding incantations, then the Taiyi Incantation. Visualize the Fire Wheel turning within the water, then test its warmth with your hand. If, after one hundred recitations, the water bubbles like fish eyes, the practice has achieved one degree of success. Continue reciting the incantations until, upon testing the water after one hundred or fewer recitations, the work is complete.

**Taiyi Incantation:**
Reverently invoke the Heavenly Perfected of the Great One, the Heavenly Perfected of the Primordial Beginning, the True Immortals and True Persons, who align above with the position of Qian. The Six Ding spirits of the left, the Six Jia lords of the right, I receive the heart of heaven to universally deliver the myriad spirits. By the numinous incantation of the Great One, the Fire Wheel of the South, expel evil and dispel illness, consecrate the water and command its efficacy.

This consecrated water cures all ailments and dispels all malevolent forces.
**Pacify the Five Marchmounts.**
**The Eight Trigrams bring peace and stability.**

If in a household the cauldron rings, the well boils, chickens crow at night, dogs behave strangely, doors open of their own accord, blood is spilt or fires set, objects move by themselves, mountain specters manifest, or if the dwelling is haunted by baleful influences, demonic altars, or spirits occupying the home, offer tea, wine, fruit, gold, paper money, and incense in portions of five to the Five Directions, the Five Emperors, and the Five Marchmounts. Take a square brick, burn it, polish it smooth, and inscribe upon it the aforementioned talisman in cinnabar. Bury it at the center of the afflicted place, and the disturbances will cease, transforming misfortune into fortune.

**The Nine Palaces bring peace and stability.**

For those suffering from annual or monthly calamities, select a day when the Five Fortunes and the Great One are in ascendance, at the hour of *ding-mao-you* (5–7 p.m.), face the appropriate direction, and inscribe two talismans in cinnabar. Place one within a bottle and carry the other on your person for matters of great importance. Then, use nine bottles arranged in the pattern of the Northern Dipper and bury them in a purified chamber. Morning and evening, pray and make offerings, burning incense and making supplications. When the time of calamity arrives, set up the nine positions of the Northern Dipper, present scriptures, paper money, horses, wine, and fruit in gratitude. Carrying the talisman is also efficacious. For minor calamities, inscribe the talisman beneath the Dipper when the stars and moon are visible.

**Establishing the Fire Prison:**
For mountain demons, one-legged spirits, venomous dragons, and disruptive entities that harass the living, set fires, drip blood, steal property, or take lives—entities that local earth gods dare not restrain and community spirits cannot defend against—establish a Fire Prison to examine and punish them. First, meticulously document each case and submit it to the Heavenly Ministry to await the imperial decree. Once the Fire Officials of the Southern Dipper are dispatched to enforce the mandate, the prison may be established.

To establish the prison, use three *dou* of purified ash in a clean chamber, forming an ash altar nine *chi* in diameter or three *chi* and six *cun*, leveled with a mirror. Place a fire vessel at its center and burn thirty-six stalks of brushwood. Cast three talismans into the fire and recite the **Incantation for Establishing the Fire Prison**:
Red qi and blazing smoke, a searing iron city.
Imprison the guilty ghosts; interrogate them without cease.
The Southern Dipper scorches their bones; the Fire Emperor burns their forms.
Swiftly confess your crimes and origins to bring peace to the people.
Fire soldiers seize and inspect, incinerating the demonic encampments.
Those who dare disobey shall be recorded by the prison authorities.

**Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the decree of the Jade Purity King of Highest Heaven!**

**Fire Prison Talisman.**

Press beneath the nail of the middle finger to draw the qi of the southeast and inscribe it. Recite the incantation:

Six-Handed Lord of the Mountain, dwelling in the hidden valley.
At dawn you float upon Metal of Geng, at dusk you return to Wood of Jia and Yi.
At night you guard Fire of Bing and Ding, four-eyed over the great sea.
Your head rests upon the cinnabar of the north, your feet tread upon the stars of the Dipper.
Thirty-six heavenly gods, swiftly establish the Fire Prison.
When establishing the Water Prison, alter the word to "water." Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the decree of the Supreme Emperor!

First, write a single "fire" character upon the ash altar, recite the incantation, and draw southern qi to blow upon it. Then, starting from the right of the "fire" character, trace a circle to the left, then back to the right, forming two "fire" characters. Recite the incantation once more, then write another "fire" character in the center and recite the incantation again. Next, recite the **Incantation for the Fire Officials**:

Reverently summon the Samādhi Fire Officials—Great Fire Severity, Great Fire Form, Great Fire Abiding—swiftly establish the Fire Prison.
Seize the ghosts and spirits with haste; their retribution shall manifest instantly.
Swiftly heed my words, swiftly respond to my voice.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees!

Then recite the incantation:

Emperors of the Fire Bell, Thunder Fire Generals, descend in blazing fire and burn through the hearts of ghosts.
Reverently summon the Fire Bell Valiant Warriors, Fire Bell Generals, Fire Bell Divine Lords, Fire Bell Lads—swiftly send down true fire to burn them, swiftly, swiftly, swiftly!

Upon completion, draw southern qi and blow ten times, then take a mouthful of southern qi and blow into the prison. If capturing fierce and malevolent ghosts, spirits, or baleful influences, summon the Prison Scribes of Fengdu. For all manner of demons and specters, invoke the Five Emperors’ Interrogation Officials. Affix the **Jade Purity Heaven Fire Prison Placard** above the prison and list the Fire Prison divine generals below. Offer incense, flowers, wine, and fruit in worship. Do not submit written petitions; the celestial generals, officers, and soldiers of the Fire Prison shall carry out the capture and enforcement, awaiting your report of their response.

**Fengdu Great Gods**
Reverently summon the Fengdu Dark Corpse Envoys and the fierce divine generals to swiftly come and administer punishment, bestowing severe interrogation and beating.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees!

Form the Jade Purity mudra and blow with northern qi.

**Five Emperors of the Numinous Treasure for Interrogation**
Red apricot, Wing Star’s spit, rub true socks past.
Gathered souls descend at once; the Five Agents’ lashes shatter all.
The Numinous Treasure is in my hands; no evil ghost can escape pursuit.
Clasp the mudras of the Five Directions and the Five Emperors, drawing the qi of the five directions to blow upon them.

If venomous dragons or demonic specters wreak havoc, employ the **Talisman of the Wondrous Conduct Perfected** to dispatch the Six Ding and Six Jia to capture and imprison them, rooting out their source before sending them east to Fengdu.

**Establishing the Water Prison**
Press the root of the left ring finger to draw northern qi and inscribe it. Recite the incantation:

The Dark Sea stretches ninety thousand *li*, within it a stone citadel.
Fierce killers guard the gates; venomous dragons devour essences.
Water Officials bind and deliver, pursuing and imprisoning ghosts and spirits.
Those who dare violate heavenly law shall be swept away in rushing torrents.
Swiftly confess your wicked harms, each revealing your name.
Should any refuse to submit, we shall send you to the Heavenly Soldiers.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the decree of the Jade Purity King of Highest Heaven!

Form the Kan trigram with the right hand and the Jade Purity mudra with the left, inscribing one **Water Prison Talisman** to cast into the water. Fill a large vessel with water and place it upon the ash altar atop the **Six Heavens’ Round Water Vessel**. Inscribe the **Water Prison Talisman** on a horizontal strip and place it upon the water’s surface. Dispatch the documents to the Water Prison officials and scribes to capture and subdue demonic entities, manifesting their forms upon the ash altar.

**Exorcism Incantation**
Divine Radiance of the Numinous Empyrean, one hundred thousand Heavenly Soldiers—
Swiftly pursue the vengeful souls to manifest their forms within the water.
(For the Fire Prison, say "manifest within the fire.")
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the decree of the Jade Purity King of Highest Heaven!

**Fire Prison Generals**
Fire Bell General, Fire Bell Divine Lord, Fire Bell Valiant Warrior, Fire Bell Lad.

**Water Prison Generals**
Great General of Frigid Ice, Frigid Ice Valiant Warrior, Envoys of the Five Brooks, Swift and Fleet Envoys.

**Numinous Empyrean Talisman for Subduing Demons and Slaying Ghosts**
For malevolent entities that cannot be subdued, write in cinnabar upon yellow paper, burn to ash, and blow it away—they shall be captured and sent to distant lands at once.
Form the Numinous Empyrean mudra, blow upon the talisman, and point your sword in their direction—evil shall flee ten thousand *li*.
Draw the qi of the five directions; abstain from meat and fish.

**For Pacifying Mountain Demons and Five Manifestations**
Treat the talisman with care; disrespect shall invite celestial calamity.
Upon completing the inscription, recite the patient’s afflictions and command the divine generals—each shall act immediately to capture them, awaiting your arrival to dispatch them.

**Pacifying Sea Talisman**
When crossing rivers or seas and encountering winds threatening to capsize your vessel, inscribe the **Pacifying Sea Talisman**. Visualize the Dipper’s mouth covering your head, the Dipper’s handle pointing forward toward your nose, and your nose aligned with the bow of the ship. Recite the **Disaster-Dispelling Incantation** seven times, cast the **Pacifying Sea Talisman**, then recite the **Pacifying and Stabilizing Incantation** once and blow upon the ship—the winds and waves shall immediately subside.

**Disaster-Dispelling Incantation**
Roll back, roll back! River Earl leads the way.
Dragons are halted at once; ten thousand disasters vanish.
Heavenly qi clears and brightens.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the decree of the Primordial Celestial Worthy!

*Thus concludes the thirty-sixth scroll of* The Great Method of the Numinous Treasure Scripture of Immeasurable Deliverance of Beings. *Here begins the thirty-seventh scroll.*

**Chapter on Reviving the Dead and Restoring Life**

The Three Perfected Ones’ Flying Dipper is the Dao of halting decay and extending life, the method of augmenting destiny and preserving fate. For all calamities and misfortunes, its efficacy is immediately manifest. When one’s allotted lifespan is nearing its end and disasters weigh heavily, should one wish to perform great meritorious deeds but lack the time to prepare, or have already begun such deeds yet not completed them, and life thus comes to an end, one becomes subject to worldly lament. Therefore, employ the Three Perfected Ones’ Flying Dipper to extend life and augment destiny—at most three days, next five days, or at least seven days—so that one may separately perform rites of supplication to the various heavens, restore the hun and po souls, turn back the funeral carriage, return the spirit and life, and prolong the lifespan. This may be done on the third, twenty-seventh, or during the eight solar terms and three primal origins, the ten fasts, jiazi and gengshen days, or on one’s own life’s original cyclical sign. In urgent cases, no day need be chosen, except when the Demon’s Cudgel (kuigang) aligns with the patient’s or the ritual master’s own life sign—this must not be used. If the celestial count or destiny’s numerical tally reaches nine, it cannot be remedied. The first three celestial stems form the Cudgel (gang), the latter three the Demon (kui); on yin days, this is reversed. If the day of the ritual bath appears peaceful yet the illness lingers, the lifespan will not be long.

In spring, the Dragon; in summer, the Sheep; in autumn, the Dog; in winter, the Ox—when the cyclical stems and branches of the resonant tone (nayin) conflict with the Water element, as in *renxu*, *renchen*, *dingchou*, or *dingwei*. First, sweep and purify the chamber, then arrange nine lamps according to the Dipper’s form. Each Dipper step requires three wicks of lamp grass, filled with clear oil to an even level, using only fresh supplies. Nine portions of five fruits, nine vases of seasonal flowers, nine measures of clear wine, nine cups of pure mountain spring water, nine incense burners, twenty-seven cloud cranes, nine cloud horses, and two *zhang* each of five-colored threads—all must be arranged in order. On the cloud horses, write nine memorial petitions; on the saddle bridges, inscribe nine life talismans for the patient. Additionally, set out nine separate offerings: two portions for the Sheep-Holder and Rāhu Messengers, four for the Four Duty Deities, one for the Earth God, one for the patient’s original cyclical sign, and one for their life’s Perfected Official. Arrange incense, tea, wine, and fruits in order.

Do not allow monks, nuns, women who have recently given birth, those in mourning, chickens, dogs, or garrulous persons to witness this. Do not strike bells or chimes, nor raise one’s voice in invocation. Proceeding thus, one will surely obtain a response.

When entering the altar to make supplication, first offer incense, then recite the *Purification of Heaven and Earth Spell* and sprinkle the consecrated water over the altar, ritual mat, and offering table. Next, light the lamps: in spring and summer, begin from the Dipper’s mouth; in autumn and winter, from its handle. For each lamp, recite the spell once and burn one talisman. The spell reads:

*Resplendent Seven Stars, in the northern quarter’s domain,*
*Beneath the Celestial Avenue, beside the Imperial Court’s side.*
*They govern the people and all things, they regulate yin and yang.*
*Rewarding good and punishing evil, bestowing fortune and dispelling calamity.*
*May the people’s lifespan not be cut short but endure,*
*May the people’s customs know no peril but thrive in health.*
*Within the Dipper dwells the numinous—hear my proclamation!*

After lighting the lamps, perform nine bows, then offer incense again and recite the *Purification of the Altar Spell*:

*By command of the Vast Heaven, flowing metal dissolves and congeals.*
*The Four Sevens’ vast expanse clears defilement, dust vanishes, and purity reigns.*

Recite this nine times, then blow toward the eight directions. After a long pause, perform nine bows again. Next, recite the *Invocation of Petition*:

*I, [your name], a humble servant, now open the rite. Attending are the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, the Five Thearchs’ Duty Talismans, the Duty Deities of the Day, the Duty Talismans of the Three Realms—*
*—Upper Realm Duty Talisman: Zheng Yuanxi,*
*—Middle Realm Duty Talisman: Jiao Gongnu,*
*—Lower Realm Duty Talisman: Zhang Yuanbo,*
*—Year Duty Messenger: Cui Shuxuan,*
*—Month Duty Messenger: Lu Jiquan,*
*—Day Duty Messenger: Dou Yangguang,*
*—Hour Duty Messenger: Deng Hengwen,*
*—Together with the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Sheep-Holder and Rāhu Messengers—*
*I humbly beseech the Perfected Elder Thearch of the Five Numinous Ones of the Northern Quarter, the Holy Mother of the Nine Heavens, the Nine Luminaries of the Northern Dipper, the Four Sage Marshals, and the Sacred Assembly within the Dipper.*
*I have now established this altar, arrayed the Dipper’s form, and urgently implore the Stellar Heaven.*
*I reverently hope for your sagely compassion, that you descend your true qi, grant my petition, and bestow a response. I, [your name], respectfully speak these words.*

After this, offer incense again and perform nine bows, prostrating on the ground and knocking the teeth thirty-six times. First, visualize the liver emitting green qi transforming into a Green Dragon, the heart emitting red qi transforming into a Vermilion Bird, the lungs emitting white qi transforming into a White Tiger, the spleen emitting yellow qi transforming into a Yellow Dragon, and the kidneys emitting black qi transforming into a Dark Warrior. From the five viscera, five-colored true qi emerge like a long rainbow, shooting straight before the Dipper’s mouth. After a long while, they coalesce into a Jade Pillar of the Immortal-Crossing Bridge. Visualize yourself in proper attire, dressed in the colors of your official rank, with purple qi emanating from your crown. Mounting this purple qi, ascend the Immortal-Crossing Bridge to the Dipper Palace. Each star is as large as a cartwheel, radiant as the sun, containing golden towers and jade halls, jeweled mountains and crystal waters, coral trees, and attendants—all the Nine August Messengers, embroidered-robed numinous officials, Golden Lads, and Jade Maidens. For each star, perform nine bows and present your petition.

After a long while, return to the altar’s base, where purple clouds and rare fragrances appear. You will then see the Sheep-Holder and Rāhu Messengers, resembling Jade Maidens—one holding a golden tray with a sheep’s head, the other wielding a flower branch and sword. They first inspect the ritual offerings, then ascend into the Dipper. If you perceive rare fragrances or see purple clouds, it is the descent of the Nine Stars’ Sagely Assembly. Perform nine bows again.

Then serve tea and offer wine, performing nine bows for the initial libation. After this, read the memorial petition. The ritual host performs three tea and wine offerings, accompanied by three prayers. For the second libation, offer wine three more times, read the petition, and perform nine bows. For the final libation, read the memorial petition for the escorting generals, then burn it in a blazing fire.

The master, along with the Four Upright Three Messengers, the Star Official of One’s Life Destiny, and the Original Chronogram, proceeds to the gate of the Star Dipper Lord of their respective affiliation. For each star, they bow three times at its core, then return before the ritual altar to await the response of the guardians.

Thereafter, the remaining memorial petitions, spirit money, horses, clouds, and cranes are burned. Upon completion, the Dispersing Spirits Incantation is recited:

*"Celestial spirits return to heaven,
Earthly spirits return to earth.
Should they be summoned again,
Let it be as before."*

Then, the Returning to the Brazier and Dissolving Disasters Incantation is chanted nine times, followed by nine bows and the prayer:

*"At dawn, face the Celestial Terrace,
At dusk, lodge within the Nine Heavens’ embrace.
Celestial spirits, through the night, submit their plea,
To dissolve and dispel all calamities swiftly."*

The altar is then dismantled.

If the illness shows no worsening or even diminishes, proceed with the *Yusilu* (Life-Restoring Rite) to replace the name of death with that of life, absolve sins, and resolve misfortunes—thus prolonging life in this world. Prepare accordingly by submitting a memorial of gratitude to the Thirty-Two Heavens, or conduct a *Fuhun Jipo* (Rite for Restoring the Hun and Po Souls).

**Memorial Petition for the Dipper Rite**
*[Official Title] Your Servant [Name]*

Based on the submitted petition and the petitioner’s birth year, month, day, and hour, currently afflicted by [specific illness], first offering repentance for transgressions as follows...

Deeply concerned over grave offenses, and further beseeching relief from profound disasters. Fearful of yearly calamities, monthly misfortunes, the influence of *Kuigang* (the Demon Star), the clashes of the Five Phases, the entanglements of *Tianluo-Diwang* (Heavenly Net and Earthly Snare), and the malevolent stars or baleful spirits assailing one’s destiny.

Thus, with utmost reverence, this petition is humbly presented to the Nine Morning Star August Lords of the Northern Dipper, the Nine August Ladies, the Inner Consorts of the Northern Dipper’s Great Unity, the Mystic Mothers and Divine Consorts—Eldest Daughter, Middle Daughter, Youngest Daughter—and the Left and Right August Ladies of the Lofty Emperor, the True Sovereigns within the Dipper, and all attendant spirit officials.

Imploring Your Sagely Compassion, deign to descend with True Radiance to illuminate and scrutinize this plea. Earnestly beseeching forgiveness for transgressions and the absolution of karmic burdens. May disasters and misfortunes be eradicated, all pernicious *qi* and malevolent illnesses purged, and encroaching demonic spirits dispelled. Grant the prolongation of life, the augmentation of destiny’s span, the swift alleviation of suffering, and the restoration of peace. In profound gratitude for the boundless grace of August Heaven, this petitioner, in awe and trepidation, awaits Your divine response and humbly awaits Your sacred decree.

*[Year] [Month] [Day]*
*[Official Title] Your Servant [Name]*
*Memorial submitted.*

**Petitioning Masters:**
- *Scripture Master:* Supreme Clarity Wondrous Conduct Perfected Person
- *Register Master:* Supreme Clarity Lordly Sovereign Perfected Person
- *Initiation Master:* Supreme Clarity Fountain-Descending Perfected Person

The above memorial is submitted in seven copies, without directional envelopes, sealed with yellow paper strips, and presented to the Seven Morning Star Lords.

*[Official Title] Your Servant [Name]*
*Memorial respectfully sealed.*

For each of the Nine Lords, spirit money, horses, clouds, and cranes are offered as per the standard rite. On the saddle bridge of each horse, inscribe the *Seven Primes Talisman* and the vermilion *Dipper Scripture Talisman*.

**Alternative Method:**
Prepare nine grand cloud-horses. On each horse, inscribe the title of the ritual master and the details of the petition, specifying the requested actions. Each horse is dedicated to one Dipper Star Lord, with the phrase *"Humbly awaiting Your sagely decree"* appended.

At the appointed year, month, day, and hour, use the *Flying Mystery Three Qi Jade Chapter Seal* on the ritual platform. On the saddle of each horse, inscribe the *Dipper Scripture’s Auxiliary Talisman*.

Offer nine portions of incense, tea, wine, and fruit, then burn them. At that moment, pray to the Three Perfected Ones, beseeching them to submit the petition and manifest a clear response.

Clasp the *Ziwu Dipper* with both hands, and with a single cloud-horse, present the petition as it flies into the Dipper. Behind the cloud-horse, inscribe the titles of the Three Sagely Perfected Ones. Seal the petition with the cover inscribed: *"To the [specific] Star Lord, respectfully submitted by [Official Title]."* Command the Four Upright Messengers of *Dingjia* to fly the petition into the Dipper.

Take three pinches of ashes, mix them with the pure water of the Dipper Star, consume a small portion, and anoint the five centers (palms, soles, and crown), then await the response.

The vermilion *Seven Primes Talisman* and the talismans for dispelling various malevolent spirits are inscribed as above.

**Chapter on Flying the Spirit into the Dipper**
The August Person declares: Within the mountains, rivers, seas, and lands of the Lower Realm, amidst cities, villages, and hamlets, the spirits of stones, waters, birds, and beasts, the unorthodox deities of the Five Phases, the fierce and malevolent ghosts of the lower earth, the *chimei* (demons) and bewitching specters—all recklessly conjure calamities, engage in heterodox practices, and entangle living beings, defying resolution.

Or, within the Northern *Fengdu* (Netherworld), the divine officials who partake of blood offerings, those connected to ancestral spirits or recently transformed kin, or those embroiled in netherworld litigation that extends to the living—all such lingering afflictions and harms remain unresolved.

By establishing the *Three Celestial Mystic Pivot Sacred Altar* within a purified chamber, prayers are answered immediately, and peace is restored.

**Method:**
Select purified earth, a secluded chamber, or a remote, tranquil wilderness. Construct an altar three feet high. Upon it, arrange the Seven Mansions of the Southern Palace, within which place the Six Offices of the Southern Dipper. At the center, position the Nine Morning Stars, the Three Terraces, the Sun, and the Moon, lighting twenty-one lamps. At the core, place the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor Lord’s central altar. Before it, set a *Dong* (cave) table with twenty-one positions, including the Three Officials, Four Saints, Orthodox Unity Perfected Person, Three Generals, Four Upright Messengers, the Year Star, Earth God, and the Sheep-Holder and Rāhu Lords.

Use five-colored threads, extending from the mouths of the Dipper lamps to the base of the *Dong* table. On the ground, mark a square of three feet and six inches with white chalk, opening gates on all four sides.

Burn the true names of the Two Dippers in the brazier’s flame. The master enters through the Heavenly Gate, flying the spirit into the Dipper, secretly presenting the oral petition to the lofty perfected ones, concealing transgressions, harmonizing the year and destiny. Thus, demonic disturbances cease, the human realm is purified, and responses are wondrously efficacious.

First, pace the Dipper, entering through the handle and exiting at the mouth, then returning to the handle to envelop the body. Pace into the Dipper’s mouth again, bow three times, and on the third bow, prostrate oneself. Visualize the body in accordance with the method: the lower elixir field, clad in white, enters; the cinnabar palace, clad in crimson, enters; the mud pill, clad in purple, enters.

Upon completion, visualize the five viscera’s *qi* in their five colors, riding the spirit. The tongue becomes the *Bridge of Immortal Ascent*, resembling a long rainbow, faintly visible. Gradually, it becomes distinct—a pool of water appears before you, upon which a bridge spans, leading directly into the Dipper’s mouth.

Having ascended the bridge upon the *qi* and reached the Dipper’s mouth, one beholds radiant light shining resplendently like the moon, within which stand jade halls and golden steps. Silently summon the Four Upright Envoys and declare the intent of the offering in full. The envoys enter the Dipper and present the petition to each stellar palace in turn. Then suddenly appear the two envoys, *Qingyang* and *Tuoluo*, descending to inspect the purity of the offering altar, after which they report back to the stellar palace. From within the Dipper, the superior petitions the numinous officials; the master of ceremonies presents the matter, and upon perceiving an intent to grant approval, one bows twice and withdraws.

Again, visualize as before and present the petition within the Southern Dipper, where the *Fire-Bell Great General* and the Six Stellar Lads descend to inspect as previously. After a while, purple clouds and rare fragrances appear, or a crimson light enters the chamber—this marks the descent of the Two Dippers. Those in mourning, women, chickens, dogs, monks, and nuns must be excluded.

**Flying the Dipper:**
Use large paper *cloud-horses*, inscribing upon the saddle-bridge the talismans of the Northern and Southern Dippers. Extract from this scripture and write in vermilion; in the blank space, compose a petition. For each *cloud-horse*, inscribe the name of one stellar lord, presenting the memorial in the usual form. At the moment of burning, recite the proclamation.

**The Life-Nurturing Death-Rescinding Formation:**
The scripture states: It possesses the power to reverse death and inscribe life, to dispel calamities and deliver from misfortune. The *Life-Nurturing Death-Rescinding Formation* is the great compassion of the Perfected. This arcane wonder is left to deliver living beings, with responses manifesting in an instant.

For those afflicted by grave illness or misfortune, inscribe one talisman, along with the cyclical year, month, day, and hour of birth, and the person’s name. Record their lifetime transgressions in full, seal it securely, and offer ten strings of gold coins. On a quiet night, perform the Dipper-pacing ritual, entering the Dipper’s mouth, facing the Dipper, reciting the incantation, and blowing upon the star corresponding to the person’s natal phase before burning it together. After some time, inscribe another talisman, burn it to ashes, and have the person ingest them. Inscribe yet another talisman and have them wear it.

That very night, report how many years of life have been extended. Further, employ the hundred-mark verification method to cross-examine. The talisman incantation reads:

Reverently invoke the Five Star Spirit-Responding Thearchs to harmonize with the life-destiny of so-and-so. Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Celestial Thearch’s decree and ordinance command.

**Format for Burning the Talisman and Petition:**
[Your subordinate, so-and-so of such-and-such rank,] states: So-and-so, born on such-and-such year, month, day, and hour, belongs to such-and-such star of the Northern Dipper and suffers from such-and-such afflictions. Fearing past-life karmic debts and present-life transgressions, having unwittingly violated prohibitions, [I] humbly submit this sealed confession, beseeching deliverance from suffering, prolongation of life, and passage through calamity.

Reverently invoke the Five Star Spirit-Responding Thearchs of the Northern Dipper to harmonize with the life-destiny of so-and-so, remit sins, dissolve disasters, resolve all perils, deliver from illness and suffering, and grant so-and-so complete and lasting recovery. Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Celestial Thearch’s decree commands. By the ordinance of the Celestial Master and Perfected Lords.

Submitted on such-and-such year, month, and day by your subordinate, so-and-so of such-and-such rank.

If no response manifests that night, employ the subsequent talisman and proceed as before.

**Life-Renewing, Death-Transcending Formation**
The talisman incantation reads:
Within abides the Death-Transcending Spirit,
Within abides the Southern Culmen Longevity Lord,
Within abides the Transcendent Marshal Great Divinity,
Within abides the Life-Cherishing Elder Han,
Within abide the Southern Office’s Directors of Destiny and Records,
The Venerable Divinities who prolong life, augment destiny, and deliver from calamity.
Resurrecting the decayed, reviving the dead, boundlessly delivering beings.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Numinous Treasure Talisman’s ordinance commands.

**Swift Deliverance of Departed Spirits**
The Mystic Master states: When approaching the altar to subdue demonic and wayward spirits, one must ensure benefit for both the living and the dead. First, perform the Prison-Breaking Rite. All procedures for this method align with those of the Grand Purificatory Deliverance of the Departed.

**Prison-Breaking Incantation:**
Supreme Mystic Origin, Supreme Dao Lord,
Instruct your subordinate to wield the talisman, illuminating and shattering the dark peaks.
May the numinous soul depart and be freed.
If subduing a sinful spirit, swiftly, swiftly, as the ordinance commands.

Recite this incantation nine times while facing the Celestial Gate, then blow upon the departed spirit. Thereupon, the soul shall be liberated from suffering, and one may proceed with the Water Refinement Method.

**Incantation:**
Kan’s script emerges from emptiness—
Withered, it flourishes anew; extinguished, it revives.
Attaining birth in heaven, it receives the Great Numinosity.
Through the Nine Heavens’ kalpas, it cycles through rebirth.
Filth and burdens dissolve; from corpse, it returns to life.

For this method, take a vessel of water, face due north, and knock the teeth nine times. Envision three Jade Lads of Yang emerging from the heart and seven Jade Maidens of Yin emerging from the kidneys. Spit seven mouthfuls of saliva, then perform the Fire Refinement Incantation:

**Incantation:**
Li’s script blazes forth—
Sunlight and moonlight, circling the Cavern Yang.
Flowing fire enters the vessel, refining and transforming yin’s radiance.
Corpse-filth vanishes; myriad qi harmonize in well-being.
Directly departing the Five Sufferings, it ascends to heaven.

For this method, take a vessel of fire, face due south, and knock the teeth three times. Envision the preceding incantation, exhale qi three times, recite the incantation seven times, then take the true form of Fengdu, burn it to ashes, and recite:

**Incantation:**
By the Primordial Talisman’s command, demons are subdued and the ordinance obeyed.
Escorting the departed soul, delivering it to the Southern Palace’s ranks.
Fengdu’s ashes disperse; the Three Palaces’ forms dissolve.
Bonds, fetters, and karmic obstructions are remitted, allowing transformation and rebirth.
Refined according to rank, it ascends to the blessed courts.

Once the incantation is complete, press the tongue against the upper palate, envision the body as that of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, and silently recite the hidden invocation once. Envision golden light filling the mouth, form the Jade Clarity mudra with both hands, blow upon the ashes, and release the mudra toward the northeast. The soul shall then ascend to the Vermilion Palace—this is the essence of swift deliverance; perform it with utmost sincerity.

**Lingbao Summoning-Soul Talisman**
Right: In accordance with the *True Talisman of the Jade Clarity Treasure Register for Summoning the Soul*, report to the spirit officials of the Three Realms and the local domain masters, the divine envoys who summon souls and seize spirits.

By the command of the Most High, swiftly pursue and seize all malevolent and pernicious forces causing harm, detain them without release, and compel the sunken souls to hasten to the Mystic Altar for deliverance. Permit no delay; ensure their swift rebirth.

By this true talisman, transcend and ascend to the Dao-realm. Let it be executed as decreed, transmitted by wind and fire couriers.

*Concluding the Thirty-Seventh Scroll of the* Great Method of the *Lingbao Wuliang Duren Shangjing*
*Beginning the Thirty-Eighth Scroll of the* Great Method of the *Lingbao Wuliang Duren Shangjing*

**Chapter on Praying for Offspring**

The Mysterious Master said: The methods of the *Lingbao* are boundless in transformation, arising from spontaneity, and cannot be fathomed by mere conjecture. Whether as talismans or scripts, there is nothing they do not penetrate. The gods and spirits of Heaven and Earth, the mountains and rivers, grasses and trees, people and beasts, stars and constellations, sun and moon—all that possesses form is governed by talismanic scripts. This is not because each talisman has its own specific correspondences, but rather that within Heaven and Earth, there is nothing beyond the primordial *qi* of the Origin.

Having arisen from this singular *qi*, wherever the *qi* reaches, it naturally abides. The differences among talismans arise from the variations in the division of *qi*. Beyond the *Lingbao* binding and spirit talismans, there are over two hundred additional talismans, all transformations of this singular *qi*.

**Talismanic Script and Incantation:**
*"Incline the light, turn back the chariot,
Most solemnly inspect the myriad heavens.
Oṃ vajra rāya hūṃ jvalī svāhā."*
*(Red light.)*
*"Oṃ vajra candrāya namaḥ mūlī svāhā."*
*(Yellow light.)*

Form the mudra by pressing the middle fingers together. Write the names: on the left, "Seven Bindings of the Sun"; on the right, "Seven Slayings of the Moon." Visualize the red and yellow light of the sun and moon intertwining and entering the talisman. Draw one breath of *qi* from the East and one from the West, then exhale both while reciting the incantation and forming the mudra.

If a son is desired, move the hand from the *yin* position leftward to *si* and release. If a daughter is desired, move the hand from the *shen* position rightward to *si* and release. Husband and wife face each other—he toward the West, she toward the East. At dawn, consume one talisman, and within a hundred days, a child shall be conceived. For wearing, use the same incantation, writing in cinnabar on white silk: men on the left, women on the right. For consumption, burn the talisman to ash and swallow it.

**The Secret Method of the Supreme Talisman for Nurturing Offspring**
The Most High Lord Lao transmitted to the Nine Heavens’ Holy Mother of the Chamber the *Secret Method of the Nurturing-Offspring Spirit Talisman*.

Lord Lao said: Of all things in the world, none is more numinous than humanity, and thus the human form is most difficult to attain. It is formed from the father’s essence and the mother’s blood, the union of *yin* and *yang qi*, akin to the essence of Heaven and Earth taking shape. Heaven and Earth nurture the myriad beings—flourishing in spring and summer, withering in autumn and winter—yet even they cannot sustain all. How much less can humans? To be without offspring is a grave transgression, for Heaven and Earth cherish life and abhor destruction. I pity those without children, for is this not the greatest poverty in the world?

Now, for the sake of all beings, I transmit this method, bestowed upon Celestial Master Zhang Daoling of the Han to descend to the mortal realm, universally saving those without heirs or left solitary. Instruct the couple to abstain from meat, and each morning at dawn, burn incense and pray before the painted image of the Nine Heavens’ Sage, stating their names and bowing to beseech a child. Each shall swallow one talisman, thereby securing an early conception and a steadfast womb. The child shall be radiant in countenance, luminous in spirit, adept in literature, clever and prosperous, surpassing all others. After forty-nine days of consumption, signs shall manifest: perhaps in dreams of swallowing the sun and moon, or encountering other auspicious omens, which foretell the birth of an extraordinary child.

First, submit a petition to the assembly of the Nine Heavens’ Holy Mother and the host of gods, offering wine, fruit, and fine incense.

**Incantation of the Nine Heavens’ Womb-Nurturing Spirit Talisman:**
*"The true *qi* of the Nine Heavens’ Chamber of Protection gathers..."*

When writing the talisman, face the sacred image, recite the incantation fourteen times, and complete the script as the incantation concludes. Mix cinnabar with vinegar, write on *Coptis* paper, roll into pills, and take with frankincense-infused water.

**Chapter on Invoking Rain and Dispelling Clouds**

The Mysterious Master said: When the *qi* of Heaven descends but the *qi* of Earth does not ascend, scorching fires rage, and drought demons bring disaster. When the *qi* of Earth surges upward, *yin* overwhelms *yang*, and excessive rains flood the land, causing harm. Those who cultivate *yin* virtue await the words of the people; those who perform *yang* merit have their prayers answered.

To request rain, establish a *gui*-character altar; to dispel clouds, erect a *bing-ding* altar. Petition the Valley of the Sun and memorialize the Supreme Emperor; hold the dragons accountable and pray to the Three Officials. When the allotted time expires, present yourself at the Jade Palace. Issue talismanic commands and dispatch thunderous decrees. The *ding* and *jia* spirits act, the Great Unity assists, the splendor of the Dipper subdues demons, and governance restores order. The Four Maidens are assigned, harmonizing and gathering the obscured. Upon success, the myriad people receive blessings, and virtue is rewarded. All things flourish, merits are acknowledged, transgressions forgiven, and ranks elevated. Those who attain this are enrolled among the immortals, their virtue surpassing even that of the divine lords. Those who act negligently shall be punished with reduced lifespans and demoted ranks. All must adhere to these principles.

**Method:**
Rain occurs when Heaven’s *qi* descends, Earth’s *qi* ascends, and *yin* and *yang* harmonize. Drought arises when Heaven’s *qi* descends but *yang* operates alone, Earth’s *qi* fails to rise, and *yin* and *yang* remain discordant, leading to scorching heat and fiery disasters. In some regions, cruel tyranny, resentment, and the suppression of righteousness may also cause such calamities.

When Earth’s *qi* surges upward and *yin* encroaches upon *yang*, while Heaven’s *qi* does not descend, excessive rains and flooding result. This may also stem from those who govern the people—scheming in darkness, wielding poisonous intent, failing to distinguish between punishment and virtue, and secretly harming the loyal and good.

Those who hold true office must cultivate *yin* virtue and secretly pray for the people. If the people submit sincerely and seek aid, this is *yang* virtue. To pray for rain, establish a *gui*-character altar; to pray for clear skies, erect a *bing-ding* altar. Major rituals last three days, intermediate seven, and minor nine, with efficacy determined by the allotted time.

Begin by observing purification rites and reciting the true scriptures of the *Dongyuan* Dragon Texts. Notify the local earth gods and the dragons responsible for rain, the Spirit King of the Valley of the Sun, and the Water Officials. Then memorialize the Great Emperor of Fusang, submit petitions to the celestial bureaus, and present memorials at the Golden Gate to inform the Supreme Emperor. Entrust the Great Unity Sovereign, the Six *Ding* and Six *Jia* spirits, and the Samādhi Fire Casket to restrain water demons and command the Thunder Controller Han.

To eliminate harm from bandits, the cinnabar-feathered fan dispels clouds, and the black talisman tablet governs rain. Summon the dragons to move thunder, recite incantations to spread moisture, and the lake and sea goddesses part the veils to divide the light. The Grand Harmony Sea Consort harmonizes above and below. When the wind howls in response to the summons, clear skies must follow; before rain arrives, the first thunder brings stifling heat and discord.

If the task of ending prolonged rain succeeds, it is not by one’s own virtue or sincerity aligning with heaven and earth—unless the Supreme Mystery bends to things, one must align virtue with the talisman. To pray for rain and invoke moisture:

**Praying for Rain**
First, on purified ground, establish a *gui*-character altar according to the prescribed form. In urgent cases, coat the ground with black mud to form a *gui*-shaped altar. Arrange the offering positions to the north of the altar, ascend the altar at the six watch-hours, and recite the Great Brahmā’s esoteric words or the *Dongyuan* Dragon Texts’ incantations to summon the dragons, setting a limit of nineteen days.

**Initial Three Impurities**
On the first day, notify the local earth gods and the dragons responsible for rain, memorialize the Spirit King of the Valley of the Sun, and the Water Officials of the Bureau of Destiny, all under the authority of the Numinous Treasure Great Dharma Bureau. The notification format follows the submitted edict; if no specific words are given, state the causes of drought, with the rest as per the later form. Alternatively, offer seven portions of incense, tea, wine, and fruit, and dispatch them via the Immortal Bureau.

If no response is received, on the next day memorialize the Great Emperor of Fusang and report to the Three Yuan Water Bureaus, the Donghai Penglai Capital Water Office, and submit a petition to the Supreme Mystery Capital Province, dispatching as before. If still no response, present a memorial to the Jade Emperor, submit a petition to the Three Heavens, and address the divine court at the Golden Gate, beseeching an imperial mandate to be issued to the Water Bureau.

Only then inscribe the vermilion *Summoning Dragon Talisman* and the black *Inducing Rain Talisman* on an iron tablet, and cast it into the rivers or seas. Then notify the Five Thunder Envoys, the *Ding* and *Jia* great spirits, the Wind Earl and Rain Master, and forward the directive to the city gods, the Nine Rivers and Four Seas, and the dragon gods of lakes, pools, and marshlands, setting a deadline for rain and ensuring it is ample and timely.

If no response comes within three days, proceed to the intermediate rite, with a seven-day limit, dividing it into two-day intervals, following the previous procedures. If still no response, perform the minor rite, with a nine-day limit, dividing it into three-day intervals, again adhering to the prescribed forms.

If no response comes after nineteen days, further prayers are not permitted. This may be due to: first, heavenly fate or punitive disasters; second, the supplicant’s lack of virtue; or third, insufficient sincerity. Moreover, the Most High always benevolently saves all things, and the response will not exceed three limits. Any negligence will be investigated by the Three Officials, resulting in demotion or penalized merit.

On the day the response is felt, hold an offering to thank the heavenly grace, and the officials will fulfill their duties.

**Gui-Water Altar**
Follow the standard form, regardless of size. Remove one corner from the northwest and northeast of the upper layer, add two side paths to the middle layer, and remove the southeast and southwest corners of the lower layer.

**Three Heavens Summoning Dragon True Talisman**
**Three Heavens Inducing Rain True Talisman**
The two talismans are inscribed on an iron plate, one foot two inches long and four inches wide. Write the *Summoning Dragon Talisman* in vermilion on the front and the *Inducing Rain Talisman* in black on the reverse, then cast it into waters where dragons reside.

To cast the talisman, take three steps in the *ding*-trigram direction, hold the talisman in the left hand, and wield a sword in the right. Recite the incantation:

> By the mandate of the Three Heavens’ talismans,
> summon the dragons to induce rain.
> The Heavenly *Ding* spirits lead the way,
> the Wind Earl and Rain Master rise.
> Jade dew is sealed, yin and yang obstructed;
> the two *qi* ascend and descend,
> flying winds and rushing rains.
> Dragons on duty, obey the talisman’s command.
> Should any dare disobey,
> the Water Officials will swiftly report.
> The Upper Clarity Heavenly *Ding* spirits
> will slay your form.
> By the Jade Clarity’s numinous mandate,
> you must heed this command.
> Swiftly, swiftly, as the Three Heavens’ statutes decree!

After casting the talisman, retreat quickly to avoid being startled by thunder or water.

**Rain-Praying Memorial and Official Petition Format**
Respectfully invite the Supreme Unity True Talisman, the Five Thunder Envoys, the Six *Ding* Jade Maidens, the Six *Jia* Literary Spirits, the Jade Maidens of the Rivers, Seas, and Lakes to descend at once, carrying out the imperial decree. Notify the Water Bureau of Fusang, the Spirit King of the Valley of the Sun, the Penglai Capital Water Office, the Water Officials of Destiny, the Four Seas and Nine Rivers, and the Three Yuan Water Officials. Also summon the dragons responsible for rain this year, the Wind Earl and Rain Master, the Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother, and the dragon gods of the Nine Rivers and local earth altars. Command them to oversee their respective territories, harmonize yin and yang, raise clouds and spread dew, bestow sweet moisture, and ensure ample rain to relieve the scorched earth.

If any evil disrupts the proper *qi*, beseech the thunder to strike and punish it, upholding heavenly justice. Do not allow rain to be obstructed. With grace from the Most High, may it be so.

**Stopping Rain and Praying for Clear Skies**
On open ground beneath a canopy, establish a *bing-ding* altar, or coat the ground with red mud to form a *bing-ding* altar. Use crimson silk to make a fan, inscribe the *Clearing Skies Talisman* on all eight directions, and notify the Water Officials and the Spirit King of the Valley of the Sun, addressing the dragon gods responsible for rain.

On the second day, submit a petition to stop the rain. If it continues, directly petition the Jade Emperor, dispatching the Great Unity Sovereign, the *Ding* and *Jia* great spirits, and deploy the Samādhi Fire Casket to restrain the water *qi*, sever water demons, and divide yin and yang. Upon success, hold an offering to thank the heavenly grace, and recite the Great Brahmā’s esoteric words at the altar during the six watch-hours.

**Yang Valley Bing-Ding Altar**
Follow the standard form. In the lower layer, add a central path; in the middle layer, add two paths; the upper layer remains unchanged.

**Three Heavens Parting the Jade Path True Talisman for Clearing Skies**
For prolonged overcast skies and rain-induced disasters, establish an altar in the open, cover it with an oilcloth canopy, and make a fan from red crane feathers. Inscribe the *Jade Path Talisman* in yellow upon it. Recite the incantation:

> Metal and water mutually engender,
> yet turn to oppose each other.

Fire and earth *qi* mutually restrain and punish.
Han Bureau enforces the decree, the Three Luminaries shine bright.
Yin and yang are divided and assigned, communicating with the Purple Court.
The Primordial Beginning’s Great Dao: *wu-ji bing-ding*.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Three Heavens’ Supreme Statutes command.

Place the fan at the eight directions and recite the incantation; within an hour, the rain will clear, and the Three Heavens will become distinct.

**Ritual Petition to Cease Rain (Official Protocol)**
Respectfully summon the Jade Maidens of the River, the Jade Maidens of the Sea, the Jade Maidens of the Lakes, the Direct Talismans of Water Speech, and report to the Three Origins’ Water Bureau, the Water Officials’ Offices, the Dragon Gods of Rivers, Seas, Springs, and Streams, the Cloud, Thunder, and Rain Departments, the Wind Earls, and all gods.

This year’s Rain Dragon Gods and Rain Masters: swiftly gather the clouds and withdraw the mists, divide and assign yin and yang, cease the rain and reveal the light, each returning to their domain as a sign of efficacy.

As in the second chapter, so it is said again:
Then invoke the Supreme Unity’s Primordial Lord, the Six *Ding* Jade Maidens, the Six *Jia* Great Gods, the Heavenly *Ding* Warriors, and the Celestial Soldiers to descend at once.
Swiftly gather the water *qi*, sever the water demons, part the springs, open the Jade Path, and manifest the Three Luminaries as a sign of efficacy.

In harmony with the Jade Clarity thus.

**Chapter on Returning to the Origin and Expounding the Mysterious**

All who gather as immortals and seek the Dao must know: if the spirit does not return to its root, it will not be numinous; if *qi* does not revert to its origin, it will hold no treasure. The Dharma possesses the *qi* of the Five Talismans and Five Numinous Ones, which can purge the five viscera of filth and impurity, purifying body and mind. Only then, through reciting the Dao and contemplating the True, will natural enlightenment arise, the Dao and its methods respond with efficacy, and divine transformations become unfathomable.

Those who cultivate the True must distance themselves from sensual distractions, uphold fasting and precepts, remain loyal to family and state, aid others and benefit the world, and tend to incense and rituals with diligence—thus swiftly attaining resonance with the divine.

The Dharma prescribes Five Talismans, each inscribed in cinnabar on silk of five colors, half an inch square. At dawn, burn incense, enter the oratory, ingest the *qi* of the Five Numinous Ones, reduce the talismans to ash, mix with well-flower water, and consume facing the five directions. After seven days of this practice, one may summon the Eighty-One Great Divine Officials and employ the Eighty-One Methods of Universal Salvation. Through flying petitions to the Celestial Emperor, one may deliver all orphaned souls—whether claimed or unclaimed—across the Nine Provinces and Three Realms, including those slain in battle, loyal ministers, righteous scholars, and those who met unjust deaths. By this Great Dharma, all shall be universally delivered. It may also be invoked to pray for rain, universally cure all illnesses, and achieve responses without fail.

**The Eighty-Onefold General Incantation**
First approach the seat, where the Eight Convergences and Nine Radiances naturally form the script. All myriad spirits conceal themselves within. Upon completing the invocation, visualize within the cinnabar field a swirling chaos of ninefold radiance, billowing and ascending to return to the root of life. After a long while, ascend to the Eight Effulgences, where *qi* enters the Mysterious of Mysteries. Within the Mysterious abides the August One, who welcomes the assembly of the Ten Thousand Perfected. Whatever is recited or supplicated shall summon the myriad spirits in response.

**The Five Numinous True Talismans**
**General Incantation**
Nine Radiance, Three *Qi*, Seven Governors, Five Constants.
The August Highest descends from on high, bringing the primordial yang.
Summon the myriad spirits to activate the talisman.

This talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on blue silk. Using the *Lingbao* mudra and the *qi* of the Primordial Ancestor, burn it upon the incense to summon the myriad spirits. It must not be used lightly.

The above secret mudras and incantations all possess ineffable wonders. Those who study the Dao must receive them with sincere devotion, transmitted orally and held in the heart, guarded with utmost care and never revealed. Revealing them brings calamity, and one’s form will be tormented for ten thousand kalpas.

**Total Incantation of Eighty-One Characters**
*Lán míng chǒu, xuán ā luō. Lóng zhān xū, yán tán yóu. Yuán fú bǎo, qiān lì chán. Shēn bō pó, méng fàn tiān. Chǒu duó shàn, yóu míng lí. Jǔ qiān jué, lóu yì miǎo. Fàn guāng shǒu, jiān zhú luò. Jiā qié fú, lī dà zǔn. Sān mó miào, biàn kūn fù. Dào qián chì, míng lún hé. Miè mó zì, juān yīn wěn. Dā hēi tuó, yù fù mù. Piān zhēn jiǔ, qì xū liú. Shàng xiān chì.*

The above mudras and incantations all belong to the secret methods of the *Lingbao* tradition. Whenever practicing, silently visualize the primordial ancestral *qi*, recite the eighty-one characters in the heart, then apply the eighty-one talismans. This is the natural Dao for delivering the living and saving the dead, exorcising and beseeching blessings. There is nothing beyond this—only advanced adepts may hear and know of it. Those who recklessly reveal it will bring misfortune upon nine generations.

The esoteric essence of penetrating the mysterious is the root of all methods. To attain it, one must focus on guarding the One; to practice it, one must rely on divine efficacy. When the One is preserved, the spirit responds, and numinous resonance knows no bounds. Guarding the spirit makes the spirit numinous, and *qi* gathers like treasured abundance. When spirit and *qi* abide, inner and outer radiance shines. Response and resonance become unimpeded, and one reaches the celestial perfected. Within the perfected dwells the spirit, the Great Lord of Longevity. When the perfected and the spirit resonate, one ascends to the imperial court on high. One’s name is inscribed in the Jade Register, and for ten thousand kalpas, one enjoys blessed honor. Those who know and advance in the Dao will naturally comprehend its wondrous principles. Those who know and grow lax will have their forms extinguished for all time. Those who recklessly reveal or slight these teachings will cause their seven ancestors to suffer punishment. Be cautious and heed this—heavenly law is not lenient.

**Hidden Names, Inner Chapter**
In yang years, follow the ghost; in yin years, follow the gate. From [ ] to □, ten characters are omitted, to be used according to the yin or yang year. The directions for wearing the talismans and their incantations are to be followed precisely.

One nine is concealed in Kan,
Two nine resides in Kun’s domain,
Three nine bursts forth in Thunder’s shock,
Four nine blazes in Xun’s flame,
Five nine holds the central seat,
Six nine meets Qian’s abode,
Seven nine stands upon Dui’s height,
Eight nine wounds the Ghost Gate’s might,
Nine nine ascends Li’s radiant peak—
Thus the spirit soars to meet the Jade Emperor.

The above nine talismans and directional qi incantations require visualization of the corresponding directional qi colors, coalescing into a red-orange sphere that descends into the cinnabar field.

Whenever refining the spirit, enter the oratory, burn incense, and recite this incantation in secret:

*"Primordial Yellow circulates qi,
Severing all perverse traces.
By the Supreme’s decree,
Peach and Plum are secured.
The Seven Numinous Ones govern in stillness,
Resplendent within the Yellow Center.
Wu and Ji form the canopy,
The Infant Messenger connects.
All meridians merge,
Myriad orifices attain clarity.
My spirit roams the Great Desert,
My life knows no end."*

Recite this seven times in secret.

**Decree-Descending Incantation**
*"Ling-chou, Mo-yin, [ ]-lü-mao, Tao-chen, Ni-si."*

The Five Numinous Incantations are blown onto paper.

**Five Palaces’ Spirit-Receiving Incantation**
Issue the Register of Numinous Script from the Five Primordial Elemental Palaces of the Primordial Sovereign.

**Left Eye as the Great Yang Incantation**
Place the tongue beneath the left side, visualize the Great Yang, and with the left eye observe the spleen. Draw the liver’s qi to meet it, forming a cyan mist that is received into the liver.
Incantation: *"Heavenly Peng, Heavenly Fire—Hasten!"*

**Right Eye as the Great Yin Incantation**
Place the tongue beneath the right side, visualize the Great Yin, and with the right eye observe the lungs. Draw the lung’s qi to meet it, forming a pale mist that is received into the lung palace.
Incantation: *"Metal-You, Wheel-Mao—Suppress You demons; Mao-You, seize Mao-You, fix and stabilize."*

**Brow Center as the Heavenly Stem Incantation**
Press the tongue to the roof of the mouth, visualize the Heavenly Stem, and direct the heart’s intent toward the spleen. The kidneys’ red, yellow, and purple qi emerge from the nose to meet it, merging into cyan, yellow, and white qi that gather between the brows. These transform into a five-colored pearl, which the spirit guides from the Mud Pill Palace into the abdomen, swallowing it to illuminate the interior and exterior, rendering the five viscera radiant. The pearl descends to the cinnabar field, becoming a red-orange sphere that emits a ten-thousand-zhang true fire to incinerate the body, purifying all filthy qi.

Next, perceive your dharmakāya in the form of an infant.
Incantation: *"Om, Heng-da, Svāhā, Si Incantation."*

Then recite the secret incantation:
*"Azure Essence Yang Spirit, Great White Geng-Xin,
Flaming Red Emperor, Lord of Ren-Gui.
Entrust me with Wu-Ji,
Unite with my form.
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions,
My qi-body attains numinosity.
Long life and eternal vision—
May I ascend as an immortal!"*

Recite swiftly as the Primordial Beginning’s decree.

Next, visualize the true qi of the five directions merging with your five viscera, entering through the crown of the head, traversing the five palaces, and transforming into a red-orange sphere within the cinnabar field. Swallow the talisman.

**Universal Summoning Incantation for the Myriad Spirits**
*"By the Primordial Beginning’s decree,
The Dao Lord’s edict.
Mysterious Dipper of the Three Luminaries,
Essence of Sun and Moon.
Sixfold divine radiance,
Responsive transformations of the ten directions.
I now summon [Name] Spirit,
Descend swiftly and commune.
Hasten to the altar,
Transmit and respond to the numinous decree!"*

**Jade Clarity Incantation**
For summoning the Five Marchmounts, press the red apricot to the numinous treasure. With this incantation, freely visualize the deities of the ten directions—they will arrive instantly. They may manifest as the sound of pines in the wind within your ears or communicate through a spirit youth. There will be no error. Guard these secrets carefully.

**Chapter on the Heaven-Opening Jade Contracts**
The August One said: A contract is a bond, a celestial covenant. The Heavenly Worthy bestows jade contracts upon those destined for immortality, to await their ascent as immortals. Passing through the Heavenly Gates, none may obstruct them. These jade contracts, distributed among the celestial officials—like the administrative bureaus of the human realm—each govern their own domains. How could one casually intrude? Thus, Heaven establishes these jade contracts to grant to those who cultivate immortality. Even if one’s allotted lifespan ends and the body returns to the Great Yin, possessing this jade contract allows direct passage to one’s destined realm. Presenting the Heavenly Decree, one transcends earth and soars through space, relying on this contract to traverse the Stem Winds. With the left supporting the community and the right assisting the altars, the contract aids the ascension of those attaining perfection. Only those who have personally assumed official duties may receive it. Violators will be punished by Heaven.

**Completion of the Forty-First Volume of the *Língbǎo Wúliàngdù Rén Shàngjīng Dàfǎ***

「Chapter and Memorial Meditation (Thinking of the *Pǐn*) of the **Royal Person** (*Huángrén*) says:

The method of prostrating to the **Chapter and Memorial** (*Bàizhāng*) is indeed the **Way** (*Dao*) of the **Celestial Sovereign** (*Huángdào*), as the **Royal Person** received the secret **Lingbao** (*灵宝*) **Way** from the **Heavenly Venerable** (*Tiānzūn*). In silent communion with the Three **Heavens** (*Sāntiān*), he recited the **sutra** of petition and invocation (*Kàoshēng gàoqǐ zhī wén*), a revelation not heard by ordinary mortals.

All who hold the **named** (*yǒumíng*) **True Persons** (*Zhēnrén*) rank of the Three **Heavens** alone may enter and exit the **Golden Threshold** (*Jīnquè*). Only those of the **Three Ranks of Immortals** (*Sān Pǐn Xiānguān*) may practice the **Great Lingbao Way** (*Dàfǎ*), and only they may prostrate themselves to the **Chapter and Memorial**.

For those whose **worldly passions** (*Gāngfēng*) are unchecked, without the radiant **True Wisdom** (*Zhēnhuì*) of the **Lingbao**, they cannot be overcome.

The practice must be performed on a **Regency Day of Gēngzi** (*Gēngzǐ rì*), when the sky is clear and serene. Prepare the **incense altar** (*Xiāng’àn*), face the **Heavenly Gate** (*Tiānmén*), and first hold both hands aloft to receive the **Edict of the Celestial Sovereign** (*Shèngdì Zhào*). Transform your body into the form of a **True Person**, then walk the **Five Phases** (*Wǔxíng*) **Transcendent Step** (*Chāotuō Gāng*) to overcome the **worldly passions**.

Take up the **brush**, **knock the teeth** (*Kòuchǐ*), and summon the **Three Primordial Qi** (*Sānshǐ Sānqì*) of **Yuan Shi** (*Yuánshǐ*) into the ink. Shake the **yellow silk** (*Huángluó*), inscribe the **male-female yellow** (*Zhīxióng huáng*) **sutra** with **vermilion cinnabar** (*Zhūshā*) **seal characters** (*Zhuànfú*), and place them within your **hat and shoes** (*Guān lǚ zhī nèi*). Also inscribe the **unified celestial workshop** (*Hé Míngdū Jiàngfú*) **sutra**, and place it in the **pure chamber** (*Jìngshì*).

Arrange the **petition seal** (*Zhāngyìn*) and all other offerings before the **Sage** (*Shèngqián*). Write and draw the **Chapter and Memorial diagram** (*Zhāngtú*), reciting the **mantra** (*Zhòu*) and burning incense daily, while meditating upon it until the visualization is complete.

*"To the Most High (Tàishàng) Open Heaven Seal Command (Kāi Tiān Fú Mìng), the Jade Maiden (Zhū Nǚ) Spirit Official (Língguān) Messenger (Shǐzhě), bearing the Chapter and Petition (Zhāngbiǎo), distantly proceeds to the Three Heavens (Sān Tiān).

**Chapter Seal with Twelve Small Seals** (*Zhāngyìn Shí'èr Xiǎofú*), **Thought-Storage Seal** (*Sīcún Zhòu*).
First, face the Celestial Presence (*Yuànqián*), and according to the ritual, declare the ritual and summon the Official (*Chūguān*).
Next, open the **scroll** (*Hán*), shake the **Mao text** (*Zuǒshǒu Miǎowén*) with the left hand, strike the **scroll**, then open it with the right hand. Recite the **mantra** (*Zhòu*):

After declaring the **Chapter Seal** (*Xuānzhāng*), burn incense over the brush, filling in the **“Your Majesty”** (*Bìxià Zhì*) characters.
Next, seal it with the **seal** (*Yìn*).
Upon sealing, roll up the **Chapter** and pass it over the incense (*Xiāngshàng Dù*), reciting the **mantra** (*Zhòu*):

*"The **Five Colors Qi** (*Wǔsè Zhī Qì*), surging upward to the heavens, enveloping the Chapter Seal.
Shake the **central node** (*Zhōngjié*) with the middle finger, visualizing the **Five Viscera Qi** (*Wǔzàng Zhī Qì*) transforming into **purple smoke** (*Zǐyān*), swirling around the Chapter text.
The **Five Colors Qi** (*Wǔsè Zhī Qì*), surging upward to deliver the Chapter to the **Emperor** (*Dì*).
Shake the **upper node** (*Shàngjié*) with the middle finger, visualizing the **Five Directions’ True Qi** (*Wǔfāng Zhèngzhēn Zhī Qì*) transforming into a **purple cloud chariot** (*Zǐyún Zhī Chē*).
The **Functional Official’s** (*Gōngcáo*) **old Qi** (*Gǔqì*) shall not dare to interfere.
**As swift as the Law Command (Lùlìng).*
**Mao text** (*Miǎowén*) **blown and struck** (*Chuī Dàn*).

Next, seal the **Chapter** with the **mantra** (*Zhòu*):

*"The Most High’s Ritual Prohibition (Kē Jìn):*
**Green and Purple, Vermilion Chapter** (*Qīngzǐ Zhū Zhāng*).
As my will, directly construct the **Mysterious Pass** (*Xuánguān*).
**True Qi** (*Zhēnqì*) **sealed and closed** (*Fēngbì*), the Jade Maiden bearing the **scroll** (*Pěnghán*).
Attending to the Chapter, expelling filth and repelling deceit.
The **Superior Official** (*Shàngguān*) **who oversees** (*Diǎnzhě*) shall not dare to reject or return it.
**True Essence and Primordial Qi** (*Zhēnyuán Hùnjié*) **mixed and bound**, piercing straight through the **Heavenly Pass** (*Tiān Guān*).
Coming and going unobstructed, entering the **obscure** (*Yōu*) and exiting the **leisurely** (*Xián*).
**Sun and Moon** (*Rìyuè*) **radiance unified**, **Heaven and Earth** (*Tiāndì*) **cycling in harmony**.
**As swift as the Law Command (Lùlìng).*

Next, upon completing the **Chapter** (*Cāozhāng*), immediately use the **left-hand Fighting Seal** (*Zuǒshǒu Dǒuzhòu*) to draw from the **heart** (*Xīn*) to the **hairline** (*Fàjiè*).
Next, strike (*Dàn*), transforming the body into **dry wood** (*Kūmù*). The **Nine Phoenix Spirit Official of the South** (*Jiǔfèng Zhēn Guān*) spits fire, burning the body into **ashes** (*Huījìn*).
Suddenly, a **great wind** (*Dàfēng*) arises, blowing the ashes away—only the **Primordial Qi’s origin** (*Yuánshǐ Zhī Qì*) remains, where a **white Qi** (*Báiqì*) emerges, forming the appearance of a **True Person** (*Zhēnrén*), visualizing the **Five Fighting Seals** (*Wǔdǒu*) enveloping the body. Immediately, proceed with the **Communicating Qi Step Over Passions Mantra** (*Tōngqì Bù Gāng Zhòu*).

At the **ninth step** (*Dìjiǔ Bù*), gaze toward the **Heavenly Gate** (*Tiānmén*), bowing in **three obeisances** (*Sāngǒng Sānbài*), then rise and sprinkle **sword-water** (*Jiànshuǐ*) in the **four directions** (*Sìfāng*).
Upon completion, bow again in **three obeisances** (*Zài Sāngǒng Sānbài*), then on the **tongue pillar** (*Shězhù*) above the **palate** (*Shàng È*), visualize beneath the **tongue** (*Xiàyǔ*) a **purple cloud chariot** (*Zǐyún Zhī Chē*), carrying **historians and soldiers** (*Shǐbīng Mǎ*) from the **ten directions** (*Shífāng*).

The **Primordial Qi** (*Yuánshǐ*) then ascends the chariot, visualizing the **heavens above and the earth below** (*Tiānshàng Dìxià*) both as **empty void** (*Kōngrán*), **silent and devoid of all things** (*Jìwú Suǒyǒu*).
The **seal** (*Zhòu*) states:

*"The **Purple Chariot** (*Zǐchē*) now turns the **Earthly Axis** (*Dìzhóu*),*
*its **white Qi** (*Báiqì*) ascends from the **Lower Dantian** (*Xià Dāntián*),*
*directly surging the **Mud Pellet** (*Níwán*),*
*soon seeing it enter through the **Golden Gate** (*Jīnmén*),*
*only perceiving **ten thousand golden lights** (*Jīnguāng Wàndào*),*
*illuminating and reflecting upon oneself.*

Next, visualize **one’s own body** (*Zìjī*) emitting **white jade light** (*Báiyù Zhī Guāng*), rising from the **fontanelle** (*Zhào Dǐngmén*) above, intersecting with the **golden light** (*Jīnguāng*), encircling and penetrating the body—**interior and exterior** (*Nèiwài*) **radiant and clear** (*Yíngchè*).

Suddenly, a **treasure pearl** (*Bǎozhū*) appears suspended in the **void** (*Xūkōng*).
The **Primordial Qi** then silently bows in **heart meditation** (*Xīn Lǐ*), petitioning **matters of truth** (*Shìlǐ*).

Upon completion, soon the **pearl emits ten thousand golden jade lights** (*Bǎozhū Zhōng Yǒu Wàndào Jīnyù Zhī Guāng*),*
*illuminating the **Ten Directions’ World** (*Shífāng Shìjiè*),*
*all at once made manifest.*

A **True Person** (*Zhēnrén*) then appears, taking the **Chapter text** (*Zhāngwén*) from the **Primordial Qi’s** hand to present it to the Most High (*Tàishàng*).
After a brief moment (*Shǎoqǐng*), a **Jade Boy** (*Yùtóng*) delivers the message (*Chuányán*), and the **Primordial Qi** bows **three times** (*Zài Sānsān Gǒng*) before withdrawing.

Visualize descending from the **Heavenly Gate** (*Tiānmén*) to the **altar platform** (*Tántiǎo*),*
*where the **Primordial Qi** meets with the **Subsequent Awareness True Qi** (*Cìjué Zhēnqì*),*
*the **Three Purity Qi** (*Sān Guāng Zhī Qì*) merging and interpenetrating,*
*and with intent, guide it into the **Lower Dantian** (*Xià Dāntián*).

**Chapter and Petition Format** (*Zhāngbiǎo Shì*):
*"When inscribing a Chapter and Petition, first rinse the hands and face, tidy the attire and headgear, purify the chamber and burn incense, and as per the ritual, hold the brush in the **eighth division of the sky** (*Shàngkōng Bāfēn*), equivalent to **eight-tenths of a cubit** (*Shěngchǐ Yīcùn Zhī Bāfēn*).*

**Secret Incantation for the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Immortals** (*Kēqián Mìzhòu*):
*"Nine Heavens’ Celestial Immortals, always born from Dao transformation,*
*Divine Chamber of Supreme Splendor, your abode reflected in pearls and jade,*
*Retired Residence of Vermilion Radiance, receiving duties from the Jade Purity,*
*Ten revolutions, nine returns, seven merges into five,*
*Divine radiance ascends together, brandishing the whip in the Imperial Court,*
*Dao reaches the Three Transformations, body and spirit merge in harmony,*
*The Jade Emperor’s scattered blessings, the hidden mysteries of the Feathered Scriptures,*
*Thousands of True Ones incline their wheels, the Five Stars command the True Ones,*
*Unfurling the humble cloth and feathers, the Imperial Court’s vast array,*
*Left: the Divine Tiger commands, Right: the Golden Soldier bears arms,*
*Nine Heavens’ military expedition, flashing the fiery bells,*
*Extinguishing demons and annihilating heretics, slaying evil and seizing essence,*
*Wind and fire blaze forth, the Six Heavens crumble,*
*The Northern Du abyss is exposed, the Nine Demons freeze in the cold smoke,*
*Those who stray from the Dao are punished, those who follow the Dao are saved,*
*The Supreme Sovereign commands, and the Divine Soldiers enforce it,*
*Ten thousand evils are tested and destroyed, ten thousand ghosts have no respite,*
*Any who dare to obstruct, shall be handed over to the Heavenly Executioners,*
*Heretics shall be slaughtered, poisonous ones shall be executed,*
*Divine Soldiers guard and protect, capturing evil and slaying essence,*
*The Six Heavens decree punishment, their might subduing all spirits,*
*The Treasure Spirits drive away filth, the celestial expanse clears for the Three Pure Ones,*
*Ten thousand True Ones receive their duties, all gathered in the Imperial Court,*
*The Six Symbols harmonized, the Seven Scenes radiant,*
*The Divine Wind scatters demons, the Dao field is purified,*
*The Divine Blessings dispel ghosts, the Jade Emperor blesses life,*
*The Nine Heavens ride the command, capturing True Ones and commanding spirits.*

**I pray for the fulfillment of Your Imperial Command,*
*so that the Dao may be established.*

*I bow and submit this incantation and petition,*
*following the ritual instructions as prescribed,*
*to proclaim the incantation and strike the law-drum twenty-four times.*

*To the **Supreme Daoist Lord of the Primordial Mysteries and Five Agents** (*Tàishàng Xuányuān Wúshàng Lǎojūn*),*
*I summon the **Functional Officials** (*Gōngcáo Shǐzhě*),*
*the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords** (*Zuǒyòu Lónghǔ Zhēnjūn*),*
*the **Incense-Bearing Officials** (*Pěngxiāng Shǐzhě*),*
*and the **Three Qi Orthodox Deities** (*Sānqì Zhèngshén*),*
*urgently to ascend and open the gate for the **Three Heavens’ Primordial Daoist Lord** (*Sāntiān Xuányuān Tàishàng Dàojūn*).*

*I now burn incense and submit this petition,*
*wishing to receive the **Eight Directions’ Orthodox True Officials and True Qi** (*Bāfāng Zhèngzhēn Shēngqì*),*
*to descend into my body.*

*May my invocation reach swiftly,*
*and be presented directly to the **Supreme Jade Emperor of the Ultimate True Dao** (*Zhìzhēn Wújí Dàdào Yùhuáng Zūnshì*).*

*I kneel long in spirit,*
*and humbly summon from within my body:*
*The **Five Bodies’ True Officials of the Functional Bureau** (*Wǔtǐ Zhēnguān Gōngcáo Lì*),*
*two **Direct Envoy Officials** (*Zhíshǐ Gōngcáo*),*
*two **Orthodox One Functional Officials** (*Zhèngyī Gōngcáo*),*
*two **Healing Disease Functional Officials** (*Zhìbìng Gōngcáo*),*
*two **Left and Right Celestial Envoy Officials** (*Zuǒyòu Guānshǐzhě*),*
*two **Divine Judges of the Yang** (*Yángshén Jué Lì*),*
*one **Divine Judge of the Yin** (*Yīnshén Yāng Lì*),*
*one **Officer of the Scarlet Chariot and Red Symbols** (*Kēchē Chìfú Lì*),*
*one **Officer of the Whip-Brandishing Gale** (*Gāngfēng Qízhì Lì*),*
*two **Divine Officials of the Relay Horses and Petitions** (*Yìmǎ Shàngzhāng Guānjūn*),*
*and all others, each two in number.*

*Those summoned must attire themselves in fine and visible robes,*
*adorned with crowns and trailing ribbons,*
*maintaining their dignified bearing,*
*and stand before and behind me,*
*all receiving my spoken words,*
*and separately opening the gates to the **Four-Faced True Officials** (*Sìmiàn Zhēnguān*) in this locality,*
*to inspect with their **Qi** (*qì*),*
*to summon and examine the **Officials and True Ones of the Two Primordial and Three Heavens’ Four Beginnings and Six Celestial Stems** (*Èr Xuányuān Sāntiān Sìshǐ Jiǔzǐ Zhū Guānjūn*),*
*the **Two Lords of the Scarlet Radiance** (*Chìjǐng Zǐ Èr Zhēnjūn*),*
*the **Thirty-Five Officials of the Five and Seven Scarlet Yang** (*Wǔqī Chìyáng Sānshíwǔ Guānjūn*),*
*the **Twelve Lords of the Four Beginnings and Five Elders** (*Sìshǐ Wǔlǎo Shí'èr Zhēnjūn*),*
*and the **Three Officials of the Heavy Descent and Examination** (*Sānguān Chóngxià Kǎozhào Zhū Guānjūn*) along with their attendants.*

*I ascend and open the gates to summon:*
*The **Supreme Daoist Lord** (*Tàishàng Lǎojūn*),*
*The **Supreme Elder** (*Tàishàng Zhàngrén*),*
*The **Most High Primordial Daoist Lord** (*Wúshàng Xuányuān Zhēnjūn*),*
*The **Celestial Master and His Successive Teachers** (*Tiānshī Yìshī Xìshī Sān Shīzhě*),*
*the **Direct Officials** (*Diǎnzhě*),*
*the **Officials, Attendants, and Soldiers** under Your Gate,*
*and the **clerks and minor officials** who carry out Your commands,*
*all before and behind me.*

*With fasting and purification, morning rituals and gate-openings,*
*I submit petitions, incantations, and talismans,*
*and pray for the summoned officials, soldiers, and all True Ones in this locality,*
*as well as all spirits and deities,*
*to guard and protect my body."*

I now receive the merit and rewards, as follows:

With utmost reverence, I bow prostrate to the ground and present a petition to the **Supreme Daoist Lord** (*Tàishàng Lǎojūn*), one copy.

I open the sealed envelope and, with humility, read the petition aloud. Next, I take out the petition and recite the incantation:

*"Five-colored smoke ascends to carry the petition to Heaven.
Five-colored **qi** reaches the petition to the Emperor.
Let no **errant qi** of this low official dare to interfere.
Swiftly, as the **precepts** command!"*

Having finished reading the petition, I pass it over the incense and kneel to read it once more. Then, I hold the petition to my heart and perform the ritual:

With solemnity, I dispatch the **Five-Body True Officers** (*Wǔtǐ Zhēnjūn*) within my body,
the **minor officials and clerks** (*xiǎo lǐ*), the **Twelve Book Clerks** (*shí'èr shūzuǒ*),
and the **Functional Censor Officials** (*Gōngcáo shǐzhě*), all strictly arrayed in ceremonial attire,
their **crowns and pendants** (*guāndài chuí yīng*) properly aligned,
their **demeanor and bearing** (*wěiyí*) in order,
their **brushes sharpened and ink ground fine** (*mó mò diǎn bǐ*),
their **swords girded and records prepared** (*pèi jiàn zhì lù*),
to swiftly convey this petition on my behalf.

They ascend to the **Three Celestial Registries** (*Sān Tiān Cáo*),
responding to the petition as matters arise.

Should any errors or omissions appear within this petition—
unfaithful words, misplaced phrases,
or inconsistencies in meaning—
the **Functional Censor Officials** shall correct them with their **keen brushes and sharp pens** (*cháng máo lì bǐ*),
registering missing characters (*tuōzì wéi zhù*),
and settling erroneous ones (*wùzì wéi dìng*),
so that no **Direct Official** (*Diǎnzhě*) may be delayed.

I then close my mouth and contain my **qi** (*hán qì*), ascending directly to the **Supreme Daoist Lord’s** (*Tàishàng Lǎojūn*) **Three Celestial Registries of the Boundless Dao** (*Wújí Dàdào Sān Tiān Cáo*) before,
without hesitation.

The **Left Officials** (*Zuǒguān*) oversee the passage,
while the **Right Officials** (*Yòuguān*) verify the process.

At the appointed time for my requests, the summoned arrive.
For my **warding** (*yáng*), the malevolent retreat.
For my **assistance** (*jí*), the afflicted are relieved.
For my **petitions** (*shēn*), they are granted.
For my **ritual appeals** (*zòu*), they are delivered.

Should any **errant qi** of this low official,
or **wayward spirits and malevolent demons** (*yé jīng guǐ zéi*),
intercept my petition along the **pathways and clouds** (*dàolù yúnwù*),
preventing its ascent—
they shall be recorded and consigned to the **Northern Prison of the Celestial Unity** (*Tiān Yī Běi Yù*),
judged according to the **Ghostly Precepts of the Mysterious Capital** (*Xuándū guǐlǜ zhèngfǎ chéngzuì*),
to uphold the **Celestial Constitution** (*Tiānxiàn*).

I, [Name], kneel before the altar,
awaiting the **Mysterious Grace** (*Xuán'ēn*) to manifest its response.

After a long while, I perceive the **Three Generals** (*Sān Jiāngjūn*),
the **True Officers** of left and right (*Zǔoyòu Zhēnjūn*),
the **Functional Censor Officials** (*Gōngcáo shǐzhě*),
the **Stationary Horses** (*yìmǎ*) bearing the petition,
all riding in **celestial chariots and mounts** (*chéngchēng mǎ*),
with **purple clouds and splendid canopies** (*zǐyún huágài*) shielding the petition.

In an instant—though but a fleeting moment—
I traverse countless ten-thousands of **li** (*mànlǐ*),
my **qi** now red and radiant (*chìhóng qì*),
the clouds and mists dispersing (*yúnwù dàngdàng*),
yet no **haze or mist** (*xiáyì*) lingers on either side,
only the **trees of boundless treasure** (*Duōbǎo shù*),
ascending as if hundreds of **li** high (*shēng rú shùbǎi lǐ*),
when suddenly I see a **horizontal path** (*hénɡdào*), the **Yellow Celestial Path** (*Huángdào*) of the sun and moon.

Passing the **Yellow Celestial Path** (*Huángdào*), I gaze far ahead,
where, about five or six **li** distant (*wǔliù lǐ*),
a **purple cloud** (*zǐyún*) appears faintly (*yǐnyǐnrán*),
advancing through it, I see the **Heavenly Gate** (*Tiānmén*),
and enter it, pausing but a few steps before halting.
The **attendants and spirit officers** (*shìwèi língguān*) also stop,
except for the **General of the Left** (*Zhōu Jiāngjūn*), the **Direct Officials** (*Zhíshǐ*), and the **Jade Boy** (*Yùtóng*) bearing the petition,
who proceed forward.

The **Jade Maiden** (*Yùnǚ*) presents the petition at the **Jade Altar** (*Yùàn*),
the **Direct Officials** (*Zhíshǐ*) transmit it to the **Functional Censor** (*Fángcáo*),
and we move to the **Western Gate of the Jade Enclosure** (*Yùquè Mén xi*),
where I pay homage to the **Celestial Master** (*Zhēngyī Zhēnrén*) **Grand Censor of the Three Celestial Registries** (*Sān Tiān Dàfǎshī Ménxià Dàdūgōng Zhāng*),
bowing twice in reverence (*liǎo*), and explaining in full the purpose of the petition.

The **Celestial Master** (*Tiānshī*) consents (*nuòliǎo*),
and I then stand outside the **Phoenix Hall’s Golden Gate** (*Fènghuáng gé Jīnmén*),
when shortly a **celestial boy** (*xiāntóng*) in **scarlet robe and dark cap** (*zhūyī xuánguān*) emerges from within,
taking the petition from the **Jade Boy** (*Yùtóng*) and presenting it to the **Supreme Daoist Lord** (*Tàishàng*).

A little while later, I see myself led into the presence,
where the **Supreme Daoist Lord** (*Tàishàng*) sits upon the hall,
adorned in **nine-colored clouds and mist** (*jiǔsè yúnxiá*),
wearing the **Nine-Virtue Crown** (*Jiǔdé guān*),
flanked by the **True Persons of the Mysterious Left and Right** (*Zuǎnxián Èr Zhēnrén*),
and another **Supreme Unity** (*Tàiyī*) in **scarlet robe** (*zhūyī*).

The **Supreme Daoist Lord** (*Tàishàng*) reviews the petition,
and the **Supreme Unity** (*Tàiyī*), following his will,
signs it upon the **Jade Steps of the Supreme Clarity** (*Tàiqīng Yùdì*),
and writes the character *依* (*yī*, "to comply") beneath.

A small **celestial boy** (*xiāotóng*) then collects the petition
and delivers it to the **Right Censor Officials** (*Yòuzhí Guān*),
who distribute it to the **today’s Direct Censor Officials** (*jīntì zhí cáo guān*).

I bow in my heart and take leave of the **Supreme Daoist Lord** (*Tàishàng*),
then bow twice again as I depart the **Jade Enclosure Gate** (*Yùquè Mén*) to bid farewell to the **Celestial Master** (*Tiānshī*).

Together with the **Direct Censor Officials** (*Zòuchāng Zhíguān*), I return in triumph to the **Altar of Petition** (*Bàichāng tán*),
rise, and report the matter.

Upon reporting, I take the petition and burn it in the **northwest of the altar**.

If this were an ordinary petition for a mortal,
the **True Officers** and **soldiers and generals** would simply carry the petition forward.

But if this were a **petition of cultivation** (*xiūxíng chāngbiǎo*),
each one would proceed with me to the **locality’s True Officers** (*lǐyù Zhēnjūn*).

The **True Officers** return to their **flame furnace** (*Lú*).

I, [Name], have completed the petitioning.
The **Functional Censor Officials** (*Gōngcáo shǐzhě*) and all **spirit officers** (*língguān*) dispatched from my body,
as well as the **minor officials and clerks** (*yījiān xiǎo lǐ*),
all enter through my **Gate of Wondrous Virtue** (*Zhōngmiào Mén*),
returning to their left if they were from the left,
and to their right if they were from the right (*zài zuǒ huánzuǒ, zài yòu huányòu*),
wrapping around my body and bones (*chuánshēn ràoɡǔ*),
pervading the **Heaven and Earth** (*mí lǒn tiāndì*),
guarding the **hundred channels** (*yíngwèi bǎimài*),
and resuming their positions in the **palace chambers** (*gōngshì*),
as before—without fail.

The **Scripture of the Soul’s Treasure** (*Língbǎo jīng*) and the **Scripture of the Boundless Treasure** (*Wúliàngdù rén shàngjīng*) conclude in the **Fourth Volume of the Great Daoist Precepts** (*Dàfǎ juàn zhī sìshíyī jìng*).

The **Scripture of the Soul’s Treasure** (*Língbǎo jīng*) and the **Scripture of the Boundless Treasure** (*Wúliàngdù rén shàngjīng*) conclude in the **Forty-Second Volume of the Great Daoist Precepts** (*Dàfǎ juàn zhī sìshí'èr jìng*).

**The Chapter on the Primordial Net’s Flow and Transformation**
The Yellow Stone and Red Pine True Persons say:

The heavens are most exalted and pure, yet they bear the sun, moon, and stars.
The Dao is most wondrous and sacred, yet it hosts celestial guests and feathered immortals.
The divine essence dwells within the body, relying on refined **qi** to manifest as human form,
and leans upon the spirit as its sovereign.
When these three—**qi**, spirit, and essence—reside or gather,
they can merge with the hundred spirits,
soar through the boundless void,
ascend to the three realms above,
descend into the abyssal darkness below—
unbound by direction, unobstructed in presence,
piercing through like a dagger’s edge,
endless in transformation—
none surpass this method.

All who cultivate the True Way must follow a graded path, advancing with measured steps.
Their practices, whether of high, middle, or low attainment,
accumulate through diligent effort,
naturally achieving mastery.
The primordial threads unfold:
a single thought suffices to roam,
the spirit soars to the imperial gates,
instantly ascending the three pass barriers,
traveling freely between heaven and earth.
With talismans and incantations,
they wield spirit and **qi**,
calming the **gāng** winds into stillness.
They transcend the ancestral eons’ palaces,
with ten thousand spirits in attendance,
then return to the Primordial Void’s domain.

Let those who cultivate the True Way guard this teaching carefully.
To reveal it recklessly to the unworthy
brings retribution across ten thousand eons—
how could one not be warned?

**Talisman of the Precious Register**
Written on yellow paper with cinnabar ink,
the complete incantation reads:
*"Commander of Authority, erase the register of slaughter,
East Pole’s Upper Birth—name invoked!"*

This talisman may be worn or carried,
used to transcend the soul and spirit.
When the Heavenly Gate opens,
close your eyes and recite the True Law.
Beyond the body lies another self—
this is the method of transcending humanity.

*Urgent, as the cosmic ordinance decrees.*

Each **jiǎzǐ** cycle (sixty-year cycle), at the hour of **Rèn** (入靖, entering tranquility),
face east, recite the **Yùhuáng Dùe** (玉皇诀),
draw **qi** from the **Dòu** constellation,
then take one breath of eastern **qi**,
settle into stillness,
and inscribe sixty **Precious Register Talismans**,
or sixty **Official Lords of the Sixty Heavenly Stems**—
either suffices.

Each day at dawn, recite an incantation over water and ingest a talisman. The rest are carried in green pouches.

At the three *yuan* and three *huì* on *gēngshēn* and *jiǎzǐ* nights, when stillness prevails, enter the chamber. Wear the *bǎo lù* inscribed on *jiǎzǐ* day, grasp the *Mào* characters with both hands, close your eyes, and still your mind. Hold your tongue to the upper palate, swallow a breath of *qi*—then sense an outer body, its garments, hue, and form identical to your own before you.

A star altar rises nine *chǐ* two *cùn* high. The Sun stands to the left, the Moon to the right, the Southern Dipper behind, the Northern Dipper before. The Vermilion Bird leads ahead, the Dark Warrior follows behind, the Azure Dragon flanks the left, the White Tiger the right, their wings shielding you. You drift upward until you stand before the altar, stepping *dīnggāng* three paces, ascending one grade to circle the altar counterclockwise.

Recite the secret incantation in silence:

*"Dao of the Immortals, vast and boundless,
Home of Yuan Shǐ’s primal origin.
I ascend this altar, purifying spirit and thought,
Seeking the Most High’s grace—grant me the elixir’s glow.
Its nectar’s essence, fragrant with *qi*,
Drink I take—now I may tread the *gāng*.
Five Visceral Deities, straight as incense’s flame,
Hear my sacred words—each finds its peace.
Swiftly, as the Law decrees."*

When the incantation ends, release the *qi* and enter the *dìhù*. Circle left again, reciting silently:

*"Yuan Shàng Dàluó, Yuan Shǐ’s Jade Purity,
Palace of the Jade-Clear—true teachings pass through.
Hear my secret words, transform my mortal frame,
Take the jade mist to cleanse my spirit’s core.
Now I tread the *gāng*, walk the Emperor’s path,
Pay homage at the golden gate, bow to the Jade Sovereign.
Swiftly, as the Law decrees."*

When the incantation ends, gather the *qi* and enter the *Tiānmén*—this is the third altar.

Within the *Tiānmén*, two immortals appear: a jade boy and jade girl, bearing incense and delivering messages, six in total. Kneel, close your eyes—then a divine figure descends on five-colored clouds, clad in *Shàngqīng* robes, bearing the Jade Emperor’s seal, its golden script radiant. Your name is called, and another presents a jade cup filled with misty nectar. The Northern Dipper’s *qi* is black, the Southern Dipper’s red, the Sun’s crimson, the Moon’s white, and the Three Enclosures’ *qi* swirls in five hues—each stream merging into the cup. Receive it, bow twice, and drink.

Release the *qi*, descend the altar, and silently recite the *Língshū* twice. Soar as though in heaven, flying into the Northern Dipper. The Three Enclosures’ stars crown your head as you walk—from *Kuì* to *Wěi*, turn and re-enter the Dipper, six paces to exit, forming the Three Enclosures’ shape.

Exit the Dipper’s mouth, circle left seventy-seven times (forty-nine steps), passing through the Fire Star, then eastward through the [missing] gate. A total of eighty-one steps (nine nines) bring you to the Solar Ancestor’s court before the Most High.

Turn right and proceed north to west, eighty-eight steps (eight eights) to the Lunar Ancestor’s court before the Celestial Sovereign. Circle outward, then left, right, left again—seven revolutions like a ring. This is the *wúsè jiè*.

Fix your gaze to see immortals from the *wúsè jiè* welcoming you. You then traverse the ten directions, paying homage to the Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns and Twenty-Eight Constellations. At each constellation, step *dīnggāng* twelve times in return—three hundred thirty-six steps total—until you reach the Dipper.

Borrow the *Jī* Star’s brilliance to return straight, gazing toward the Northern Dipper’s *Tiānwěi* and the *Jiāofēng* peaks. Turn southward, forty-nine steps to pass through the Fire Star’s palace again. After thirty-six steps (six sixes) through the Lunar, you reach the Water Star. From the Water Star, eastward sixty-four steps bring you to the Solar’s side, completing the Wood Star. Retracing, you pass the Water Star again, borrow its brilliance to emerge beside the Solar—eighty-one steps to complete the Metal Star.

Proceed carefully to the Dipper’s mouth, thirty-five steps to enter the Earth Hour. From Earth, return to the Metal Star. After Water and Wood, you face north toward the golden gate’s towering grandeur—the abode of Dàluó’s Three Pure Ones.

Advance eight steps, kneel twice, and recite the incantation in silence:

*"[Incantation continues...]"*

「The humble earth-walking disciple, by fortune of past blessings, has been granted the secret precepts of the sacred Master’s transmission, enabling an audience at the Celestial Hour. Concentrating the spirit to enter *Jìng* (tranquility), the nine *qì* (vital essences) are purified, and the body beyond the body is attained—thus achieving *Fēitiān Chuǎng* (flight to the heavens).

The disciple is unworthy of such heavenly favor, yet yearns ardently for the sacred Master. With utmost reverence, prostrating head and body in double obeisance, he recites the incantation in silence:

*"Again the incantation:*
By fortune, the disciple receives the dark bounty,
Thus meeting the sacred Master,
Midnight, the spirit ascends,
With one heart, he pays homage to the Emperor.

The disciple humbly reflects: though of mortal constitution and stubborn nature,
Logic cannot transcend the lofty.
With devoted sincerity toward filial piety and fraternal duty,
He hopes to gain grace and favor.
His plea is fulfilled,
And the sacred favor is received.

May this solidify the Dao/Way of his heart,
Clarify his spirit and illuminate his *qì*,
Command all spirits to obey his will.
All shall heed his decrees.

The disciple humbly prays for heavenly mercy,
To grant his petition and bestow as he speaks.
So he prostrates again in double obeisance and departs,
Then beholds his true form,
Returning to his own body at the *tóngmén* (crown),
And incants it:

*"Incantation of the Serpent and Cicada:*
Serpent and cicada, serpent and cicada,
Shedding shell, leaving dust.
I now worship the True Form,
Ascending to pay homage to the Azure Clouds.
Desiring to make the spirit and the man,
Seal debts and conceal form,
Take steps to depart,
The secret precept is potent and true.
Suddenly entering through the *tóngmén*,
This completes the *Bùgāng* (steps of the Five Powers).

If the humble one practices this,
He need not exceed five steps.
If he earnestly seeks the method of flight,
None is greater than this."

**The *Fēibù Tú* (Diagram of the Flying Steps) of the Primordial Halberd:**

The *Tàiyī Wēiyán Miàogēng Zhēn* (Supreme One’s Subtle Speech, Most True Transformation),
Born from me, attains natural enlightenment.
A single thought of the seven celestial seats,
Summons the three souls to follow and welcome.
The Jade Sovereign’s precept reaches the Heavenly Sovereign,
The Northern Dipper’s Three Platforms measure the steps.
Ascending directly to the Golden Halberd, circling the Vermilion Node,
The voice subsides, only the incense of the *Zhuàn* (sealed script) and cloudy fragrance remains.
Within the body, the Five Powers of the *Wǔxìng* (Five Stars) serve as officials,
Ten thousand spirits in unison, their sincerity pressing like a crowd.

Reaching the Nine Passes where the Primordial is obstructed,
In moments, the crane-like ascent arrives at *Liáoyáng* (Luminous Sun).
At the gate of *Liáoyáng*,
Before the Master, he prostrates and presents his memorial.
He awaits the imperial decree’s return,
Confessing his mortal offenses before the throne.

The disciple’s reckless ambition seeks to ascend,
Deploying his *qì* to rise in clouds and seek the Jade Gate.
By fortune, he passes the *Gāngfēng* (halberd winds) without hindrance,
Yet the Golden Gate reveals myriad difficulties.

Within these difficulties, the precept is easily spoken yet hard to grasp,
In the blink of an eye, he reaches the imperial presence.
The Five Masters and a thousand saints gather on either side,
Their crimson talismans beneath the Nine Radiant lights shine fresh.

He must perform his merits to join the ranks of the immortals,
Worship the sacred and ascend to the True Form—let no difficulty deter him.
The wondrous logic is not excessive; excess leads to confusion.
At another time, he may attain it more leisurely.

Those who share the Dao/Way and study together,
Knowing the secret precept, must not delay in worship.
Once the precept is received, the sins are apportioned,
Swiftly, the immortal chariot descends to the mortal realm.

Though this *Dēngtān Jué* (Supreme Halberd Precept) is now revealed in the heavens,
Even when transmitted to scholars and practitioners,
It must be kept secret in practice.
Preserve the spirit in silent petition,
The past attainments in the mysterious diagram,
Only emptiness and annihilation remain,
Purification and stillness in the void.

**The *Fēishén Xuánjué* (Secret Precept of the Flying Spirit):**

The Primordial Official resides in the *Kǎn* (water) position,
The ancestral *qì* (vital essence) of the elixir field responds to the elixir origin.
The Five Generals ride white steeds,
The Flying Dragon and mounted attendants lead the way ahead.

The liver spirit’s green *qì* wanders to the celestial crown,
Transforming into a dragon chariot ascending the Nine Mysterious realms.
The lung spirit’s youthful attendant holds the banner and node,
Clad in red, guiding to the *Níhwán* (muddy pellet).
The muddy pellet’s eight layers open the *Fǎlún* (law wheel),
Piercing the celestial passes, form responds to spirit.

When the spirit departs the body, it mounts the white steed,
Circumnavigating the Dipper, traversing the steps of *Jī* (the Great Enclosure).
Through the Great Enclosure, it passes thirty-two constellations,
Entering the *Gāngfēng* (halberd winds), ascending the Nine Heavens.
Each has a birth gate to recognize carefully,
The purple elixir and white jade are the celestial passes.

Further crossing the Five Spirits to the Great Desert,
Arriving at the heavenly gate to pay homage to the Emperor.
Before the Primordial Sage, the guide leads the way,
In accordance with the cosmic order, he knocks at the Jade Barrier.
Vast and boundless, the Great Dao/Way naturally opens,
His memorial ascends, the spirit hastens to the Supreme Luminosity.

Returning through the Five Constants to the Sun and Moon,
He cycles endlessly, beholding the Primordial Lord.
The Primordial Lord enters his abode, the spirit is concentrated and tranquil,
Already descending the celestial script, revealing the Jade Text.

**The *Zàoxīn Zhāng Xuánjué* (Secret Precept of the Memorial to the Heart):**

For any memorial to the heart,
First, one must purify the heart and eat vegetarian food.
Write a draft memorial,
Do not let words harm the meaning,
Nor meaning be obscured by words—
The recounting of events must be precise and to the point.

Once finished,
Use white paper three inches long by two *fēn* (分) wide,
Write in neat characters as desired,
With utmost reverence, holding incense.
Write it on the same day,
Do not delay until the next day.

Complete the writing in a single stroke,
Do not pause or rest during sitting or lying.
Further reduce the legal title to one line only,
Do not write two lines.

If unable to write himself,
Have another write it for him,
But the prohibitions remain the same.
He must eat vegetarian food and bathe,
Burn incense while writing,
Not alter, scratch, or add to the text,
Nor omit or write carelessly,
Nor reduce strokes or converse with others.
Violators shall surely face severe retribution.

Once written,
Perfume it with fine incense,
Seal it immediately,
Sprinkle *lóngnǎo* (aloe-wood powder) on the memorial,
Then roll it up.
Finally, stamp it with a seal,
Using the *Fāngjiǎo* (corner symbols) to open the heavenly gate.

For major matters,
Or when already prostrating yet no response is received,
Use yellow paper with vermilion writing,
Called the *Zhūzhāng* (vermilion memorial),
Which is swift and shall surely gain resonance.

On the day of the memorial,
Whether early or late,
Within the *Jìngzhì* (tranquil chamber) or the Dao/Way hall,
Or before the sacred image,
Prostrate twice and burn incense.

First recite the Jade Sovereign’s precept,
Summoning the method he practices,
And the spirits dispatched in the memorial.
State the matter clearly,
Await the opportune moment to present the memorial,
Silently petitioning its intent,
Again and again, earnestly imploring.

Once finished,
Prostrate once more in double obeisance,
Read the memorial aloud in a low voice,
Then immediately proceed to the incense altar,
Extinguish the candle and approach the sacred image,
Standing upright, his thoughts focused—
From his elixir field, the Primordial Lord of the One Beginning ascends gradually,
Sitting before the muddy pellet.
He himself kneels before the Primordial Lord,
Silently petitioning the matters in the memorial,
Detailed and heartfelt,
Praying and imploring four times.

Or, if there is a natural response,
The Primordial Lord may descend in thought to answer,
Or a voice may be heard within his ears.»

If one can truly transcend the body and communicate through spirit, the response shall be even more precise—never contrive with deliberate intent to match expectations.

After the memorial is completed,
Imagine the Primordial Lord descending back into the elixir field,
And oneself returning to the incense altar,
Placing the memorial into the iron frame,
Securing it firmly with incense,
Then sealing and dispatching the attendant officials to guard and deliver the memorial to its destination.

Once done,
Use a purified hemp wick to burn it,
Without tearing the memorial.
After the burning,
Return to the original standing place,
Calm the mind and still the thoughts,
Waiting to hear the response.

After a long while, bow in gratitude and depart.
If a red-sealed memorial is added,
Dispatch the Yellow-Armored Jade Maidens accordingly,
Following the original ritual.

The memorial’s ashes are cast into a long-flowing stream.

**灵宝无量度人上经大法卷之四十二竟**
**灵宝无量度人上经大法卷之四十三 运神合景品**

In ancient times, at the dawn of the Great Calamity,
The Five Epochs unfolded,
The Primordial Lord revealed the Cosmic Diagram,
And the Crimson Script was inscribed—
Characters vast as a *zhang* in width,
Eight-cornered with radiant bristles.

Descending the *qi* of the Golden Tide below,
It formed the patterns of the Nine Heavens,
The Western Element’s Tortoise Mountain,
Enmeshed in fourfold nets,
With the Twenty-Eight Constellations intertwined,
And the Thirty-Two Heavens revolving around it.
The Sun, Moon, and Five Stars converged within,
Above which stood twelve layered halls of jade and gold,
Where the Jade Mother of Azure Elixir, the Daoist Sovereign of the Western Element’s Tortoise Terrace—
The Queen Mother of the West—resided.

There exists the Tortoise Mountain’s Primordial Registrar,
Overseeing the true writings and jade characters of all immortals.
Within its void realm,
The Big Dipper and the Winnowing Basket revolve,
Measuring the Five Constants in thirty-five divisions,
Uniting the *qi* of the Upper Primordial.

And there are the Inner Forbidden Jade Officials,
Residing in the Queen Mother’s Western Jade Terrace,
Known as the **Lingxu Palace**.
There is also the **Lingxu Separate Hall**,
Where the Great Sovereign Jade Infant Empress—
The Nine-Spirit Supreme Mysterious True Immortal Queen Mother—
Presides over the Nine Spirits’ duties.
She rotates the Dipper at dawn,
Presenting memorials and petitions to the Thirty-Two Heavens,
And the Three Heavens’ Jade Gates.
No petition reaches without the Lingxu Immortals’ words,
No memorial advances without the Nine Spirits’ tablets.

The Great Sovereign, by command,
Records the scriptures in their entirety.

The Nine Dawns of the Northern Dipper
Are the Nine Dawn Sovereigns of the Central Imperial Primordial One,
With traces manifesting in nine forms.
One may ascend upon them to fly through the void,
Assisting the Celestial Sovereign above.
Their stellar transformations are boundless,
Their titles and ranks countless—
Impossible to enumerate fully.

Within lies the High Sovereign of the Central Purple Micro Heaven,
Whose invocation of a single star grants a lifespan of myriad thousands,
His name inscribed on jade tablets,
Where ten thousand deities gather in festive homage.
After seven years of cultivation,
His essence disperses, his form dissolves,
Transforming all things,
Mingling with the obscure and dark,
Soaring through the Great Emptiness,
Ascending to the Jade Purity.

As the *Dadong Yujing* states:
*"The Hall of Jade Chambers, the Palace of Jade Towers, the Golden Hall—*
*Though distant beyond the Three Realms and Nine Heavens,*
*They are yet unreachable.*
*Yet near within one’s own Nine Palaces of the Muddy Pellet,*
*Each a span in measure,*
*If preserved, the True One is attained,*
*As Heavenly *qi* merges with one’s natural *qi*."*

Thus the scripture says:
*"The spirit within the human heart,*
*Containing wondrous wisdom,*
*Wisdom penetrating the causes of the Dharma Realm,*
*From causes arise conditions,*
*Conditions and thoughts spontaneously evoke responses.*
*Preserve the Muddy Pellet and the body,*
*Uniting with the Nine *qi*s in virtue,*
*As if standing within a Jade Gate—*
*Then one attains the name ‘Communicating with the Jade Registers,’*
*And the Nine Mysteries ascend the soul."*

For the Nine Palaces of the Muddy Pellet,
If preserved as the Nine Heavens and Three Realms’ Jade Gates,
The Celestial Emperors are seen above—
Majestic and present—
While the body, preserved as oneself,
Is imagined in the Lower Elixir Field,
Like a deep spring in a secluded valley,
Where all hundred spirits gather and merge into one body.

Preserve the body as a lotus pod,
The Most High entering the Muddy Pellet,
Ascending as if rising above the Nine Heavens,
To pay homage before the Jade Gates’ Emperor.

According to the Master’s instructions in the *San Dong Xuanke*:
*"Though the Celestial Sovereign is distant and wondrous,*
*He resides near within the Muddy Pellet Palace.*
*Its halls and chambers are of the Seven Treasures,*
*Windows and doors naturally partitioned.*
*The Ever-True, Ever-Mysterious Responds,*
*Riding the scene upon purple clouds."*

This reveals one’s own Three Pure Ones,
Corresponding above to the Mysterious Realm,
As Heavenly and Human merge,
And essence-*qi* mutually support each other within the Nine Palaces.

It is also said:
*"Neither born nor extinguished,*
*Yet born from the lotus—*
*Transcending the Three Realms,*
*With a compassionate heart unraveling the world’s snares."*

This reveals that the Heart’s Primordial is the Primordial Lord’s divided spirit,
Residing within the Ninefold Divine Membrane,
As the master of human life within the heart.

When presenting memorials to the Nine Palaces within oneself,
Fly through the Mysterious to meet the Dao,
Carefully reviewing the memorial’s words,
Communicating with spirit by spirit,
As heart and spirit illuminate—
All hidden matters are known,
Without doubt or hesitation,
Lest one invite divine retribution.

**通天真符**
Take the day of one’s birth as the foundation,
Carve the talisman from *zhi* wood,
Five *cun* long, two and a half *cun* wide,
Using the official measure.

Pierce a hole at the top,
Thread it with five-colored silk and fasten it to the elbow—
Left for men, right for women.

It may only be used during memorial presentations.
Before presenting the memorial,
Let no one see it;
Store it in a crimson silk pouch,
And during clear starry nights,
Offer incense, flowers, fruit, and wine beneath the Dipper,
Along with twelve portions of purified *zhi* wood broth,
To the Nine Dawns of the Northern Dipper,
The Two Celestial Emperors,
And the messengers of the **Heaven-Piercing True Talisman**.

Three days before the memorial presentation,
Wear the talisman and the memorial symbol,
Fastening them to the elbow,
While fumigating the talisman with incense,
Reciting the incantation three times:

*"Heaven’s Support is impartial,
The Celestial Symbol communicates the Mysterious.
No depth is hidden, no darkness obscured,
No response goes unperceived.
The talisman bears the diagram,
Divine soldiers answer the call.
My rank is that of the Upper King,
My station ascends to the Celestial Metropolis.
Swiftly, as the Heavenly Sovereign’s Purple Micro decree."*

After fumigating with *xiang* incense,
Wear it at the elbow,
Then swallow the talisman and memorial symbol,
While maintaining a pure and refined visualization.

At the time of the memorial presentation,
Its efficacy shall be divine.

For all spoken or written memorials,
And those dispatched with sealed orders,
After summoning the spirit officials,
The response shall be swift.

Keep it hidden from others’ knowledge or sight.

The response shall be as with an echo—
Abundant auspicious clouds and strange fragrances arise,
Luan cranes and sweet dews descend,
Golden mists and celestial breezes prevail,
The heavenly *qi* becomes serene and harmonious,
Accumulated darkness clears instantly,
Sweet dew nourishes all things,
Heavenly spirits manifest visibly,
The memorial ashes ascend into the sky,
Divine radiance envelops the altar,
Ten thousand mysterious responses—
None shall be absent.

*"Opening the Heart, Clearing Forgetfulness Talisman,"*

This talisman is modeled after the drawing of the *Changshi* (Long Historiographer).
This talisman is modeled after the drawing of the *Yuan* (Assistant).

**Right Talisman:** To be used on the *Opening Day* (of the month), facing the *Wang* direction, inscribed in vermilion, with two prostrations before wearing.

After completing the prostrations and incantations,

Three doses per month—
Results shall manifest within a year.
A secret technique.

Inscribed in vermilion on yellow silk.

**Incantation for Consuming the Talisman:**
*"Consuming the divine talisman,
Illuminating the True Essence.

Deep and clear, pure and serene.

Mysterious and unfathomable.
All things lose their forms,
Chaos returns to the origin.
Hearing the voice to know the name—
Heaven and Earth’s divine threads.
Named *Opening the Heart*,
Wearing it brings supreme peace.
Attaining natural knowledge,
Ascending to the Purple Court.
Swiftly, as the decree commands."*

After completing the incantation,
Gnash the teeth three times,
Place the talisman in the mouth,
Then visualize the *qi* and swallow it.

**Instructions for the *Xin Zhang* Talisman**
The talisman paper must be four *cun* long and two and a half *cun* wide. In spring, use blue paper; in summer, red; in autumn, white—all inscribed in vermilion. In winter, use black paper with white powder ink. Beyond the seventy-two days of each season, on the eighteen designated days, use yellow paper inscribed in vermilion.

When inscribing the *Xin Zhang* or *Tai Ping Fu*, face the auspicious direction and swallow with pure water.

When ingesting the talisman, place it on the tongue, gaze eastward, and inhale the celestial *qi* (as green) through the nose into the mouth, visualizing it as green. Then, gazing upward, inhale the crimson *zhenqi* (true *qi*) through the nose, merging it with the green *qi* in the mouth. Next, gazing downward, inhale the yellow *qi* into the mouth, blending the three colors into a radiant, sun-like luminosity. Within this light, retain the talisman as a single grain and swallow it with water.

For the *Xin Zhang*, place its ashes in the mouth and follow the talisman’s precepts. Only after receiving a response—whether granted or denied—may one submit the memorial. **Do not reveal this lightly.** After receiving confirmation of alignment, one may then speak to the ritual officials.

**Eight Scenes True Talisman**
On the fifth day of the fifth month, the third day of the third month, and the ninth day of the ninth month, inscribe the eight characters □□□□□□□□ in vermilion, forming talisman pills. Place them in an empty eggshell, nestle it within a hen’s clutch, and when the chick hatches, consume it. Recite daily, and divine responses shall surely be heard.

**Divine Incantation:** *"..."*

The **Dòu-Lú-Lǐ-Wèi-Cuī-Dèng** incantation:
*"Dòu-Lú-Lǐ-Wèi-Cuī-Dèng,*
*the swift pipes bear words to me.*
□□□□□□,
*the swift pipes bear words to me.*
□□□□□□,
*the swift pipes bear words to me."*

From the sixth day of the **Liú Jiǎ** cycle onward, recite ten million times across the ten directions. Thereafter, daily recite forty-nine times. Whenever composing petitions, memorials, or reports, or when awaiting responses, recite these three incantations. After a time, you shall hear within your ears the voice of **Chóu-Mán**, and thus the matter shall be revealed.

**Anger dispels the Spirit.**

**Ascending the Spirit to Perfection**
In accordance with the Master’s instruction: The Spirit is the sovereign of the form. When the sovereign resides, the form is steadfast; when the sovereign scatters, the form is in peril. Common mortals only nourish the form, yet never preserve the essence to safeguard the sovereign.

As the *Xī Shēng Jīng* states:
*The Spirit can traverse the Dao; the Dao can ensure eternal abode.
The Spirit can make the form soar; it can also move mountains.
The Spirit’s greatest treasure is the Three-One.
One is the child of the Dao, the ancestral progenitor of myriad beings, the arcane essence of all True Ones.*

For those who cultivate and direct the Spirit, harmonize the visions to ascend the Mysterious, merge with the Dao to manifest the Chapter—when paying homage to the Celestial Sovereign at the Golden Gate—practice the silent ascent into the Dao of the Highest Clarity.

First, bathe in purity and enter tranquility, refining the form and guarding the Spirit. With prolonged practice, the Dao will naturally unfold, and there shall be no limit to what can be achieved.

If you wish to petition or supplicate, then mount the celestial chariot to the Court of Supreme Clarity, and according to the matter at hand, present your entreaties. Thus, the most essential method is complete.

**Bathing to Purify the Form**
Select the day of **Dōng Jǐng** (the Eastern Well) to bathe. This is when the sun and moon reside in the Eastern Well constellation. At dawn, take pure water from that direction, brew a decoction of peach bark and bamboo leaves for bathing—this is called *refining the corpse’s pristine essence*. Even the immortals, when wandering the mortal realm, use this bath.

Moreover, bamboo is hollow yet internally pure and white, while peach repels malevolence and dispels filth. Thus, these two are used to purge the turbidity within the form.

From the *Tàishàng Jiǔ Biàn Shí Huà Yì Xīn Jīng*, as recorded in the *Zhēn Yuè* (True Revelations), Chapter Three of *Cháng Qī*.

If you have at home the **Five Fragrances** decoction, use it to bathe the five viscera, achieving their cooling clarity and purifying the dust and grime.

Peach bark (white),
bamboo leaves,
white mugwort,
fragrant white atractylodes,
sweet cyperus,
green aloeswood.

Use these in any quantity to brew a bath. When entering your chamber for daily recitation and cultivation, you may also use this to rinse your mouth. Though other talismanic waters may suffice, none compare to this.

This is also called the **Five Nodes Pure Fragrance Bath**, to be taken on days of Eastern Well.

For instance, on the first day of the first month, the **Chéng Shù** constellation moves westward; when the **Jǐng** star aligns directly with the sun, it is the day of Eastern Well. On the tenth day of the first month, it is also the day when the **Jǐng** star aligns with the sun. The rest follow similarly.

**Entering Tranquility and Concentrating the Spirit**

Each day at the **Zǐ hour**, enter your chamber and sit upright facing the direction of your **living constellation**. Knock your teeth together thirty-six times, then close your **qi** for thirty-six breaths. Exhale to the navel above, inhale to the navel below, maintaining a continuous, subtle flow. Then close your eyes and quietly contemplate: visualize the sun and moon radiating light throughout the chamber—the sun in the east, the moon in the west.

Next, visualize the **Sun Sovereign** exhaling red **qi** in nine rays, circling your body to the left, and the **Moon Sovereign** exhaling white **qi** in ten rays, piercing your body to the right. Let your inner and outer being become transparent, with nothing obstructed.

If you have ailments, repeatedly cultivate this visualization to dispel them.

**Refining the Form of the Greater Sun and Greater Moon**
First, visualize your body as withered wood. Then, visualize red **qi** transforming into fire, and again, visualize fire emerging from your heart, consuming your entire form. In an instant, all turns to ash.

From the ash rises smoke, naturally transforming into five-colored **qi**, swirling within and forming an infant resembling yourself.

Visualize within the sun a **Supreme Sovereign of the Day**, clad in crimson robes and crown, seated at its center. Below him stand the Five Emperors, dressed in the robes and headgear of the five directions, attending beside him.

Clasp your hands firmly and gaze toward the sun. Draw in **qi** nine times through your nose, letting it enter your heart. Within your heart, the solar symbol burns brightly as a fire, vast as a cauldron, its nine purple rays piercing the Three Fields and the **Níwán** (cinnabar field), all illuminated by solar light. Your entire form is refined and cleansed, inside and out, and your **qi** returns.

Enter your chamber, close your eyes, and sit upright. Visualize the **Greater Moon** in the direction of the **Eastern Well** constellation. Clasp your hands firmly and visualize the **Moon Sovereign’s Consort** exhaling ten white rays of light, like pure silk, gradually transforming into water. This water bathes the infant within the white **qi**.

As soon as the bathing is complete, gradually restore the infant to its original form—clothed and crowned—then inhale the yellow flowers’ water and the moon’s yellow **qi**, dispersing it across your body. After some time, you will feel yourself immersed in yellow **qi**, a refreshing coldness, signifying the arrival of true **qi** within your body. Your limbs, organs, and meridians are all filled with this yellow **qi**, purifying your body, and the myriad spirits gather.

**Dividing the Spirit at the Jade Terrace**
The light between your brows is the **Three Heavenly Gates**. Three *cùn* into the left browbone lies the **Vermilion Platform and Green Chamber**. Three *cùn* into the right browbone is the **Yellow Gate and Purple Door**, like the palaces and gates of earthly princes.

Both are constructed of green and yellow jade as terraces and gates.

One *cùn* into the brow is the **Bright Hall Palace**, where the Three Court Gods reside—these are the **Divided Spirits of the Emperor of Eternal Life**.

Two *cùn* in is the **Chamber of Mysteries Palace**, where the **Yellow Emperor and Laozi** reside as **Divided Spirits of the Most High**.

Three *cùn* in is the **Cinnabar Field Palace**, where the **Heavenly Emperor of the Upper Primordial** resides as the **Divided Spirit of the Jade Sovereign**.

Four *cùn* in is the **Extreme Suppression Palace**.

Five *cùn* in is the **Jade Purity Palace**, where the **Jade Purity Goddess** resides.

These three palaces are the **Divided Spirits of the Supreme Clarity, Upper Clarity, and Jade Purity**, dwelling within the **Níwán**.

On auspicious days of the **Six Jia**, visualize the celestial emperors solemnly positioned above the **Níwán**. Visualize your body as a lotus root within the lower **Dan Tian**, deep as an abyss, then ascend through the middle **Dan Tian**, passing the **Huàgài** (flower canopy), crossing the **Chónglóu** (layered towers), piercing the **Jīnmén** (golden gate), and passing the **Yùhù** (jade door) to reach the **Níwán**. There, you present petitions and await responses as your will. Then, you descend once more through **Yuánshǐ** (Primordial Beginning) and return to the lower **Dan Tian**.

Do this daily. For any petitions or inquiries, you may await divine responses and foreknowledge of future events.

The **Seven Ancestors** were lightly dismissed and forever sunk into the Northern **Tíng**—never to be pardoned across ten thousand kalpas.

**The Rite of Sacrificing to the Dan Yuan True Person**
The Dan Yuan True Person is none other than one’s own **Shényuán Huáng** (Divine Primordial Sovereign) manifesting in form and descending **qi** into the body, becoming the master of life. Use one’s preferred **sùshí** (vegetarian food), fragrant tea, wine, and fruit. On the **Yuánchéng** (Primordial Hour) of one’s natal day, enter a purified chamber and divide one’s dwelling into four parts.

Visualize three figures as **fǎshī** (masters of the Dao), bowing and yielding according to ritual. Let them freely partake in food and drink as you will.

Burn incense and recite the incantation:
*"Dan Yuan guards the spirit—
Within and without, guard the True.
Left and right, three times seven,
Assist me in celestial completion.
Swiftly, as the **Yuányáng Zhǔ** (Primordial Yang Master) decrees."*

Upon finishing the incantation, resume seated posture and burn one **jīnqián** (gold coin) and one **yúnmǎ** (cloud-horse talisman) each.

When complete, always visualize them at your sides—
Wielding sword and axe,
Or holding **liújīn huǒlíng** (flowing gold fire bells).
When walking, they lead;
When halted, they follow;
When seated, they stand to the left;
When standing, they stand to the right.
Within a hundred days, results will manifest.

When angered, keep them distant.

**Practicing the True and Entering Samadhi**
The Dao does nothing, yet nothing is left undone.
The heart may be verified, yet not by mere intellect.

What is *knowing*? What is *responding*?
Intellect dispels intellect, verifying emptiness and responding to it.
When response has no origin, emptiness is the Dao.
Unified, all affairs are complete.

One is the root; affairs are the gate.
Affairs return to One; One abides eternally.
Abiding has no form—
A provisional phrase to guard emptiness.
Guard the void, and longevity follows.
Awaken to impermanence, and the Dao endures.
Reside in stillness within, and virtue expands outward.
Within, coiled like a tortoise;
Without, virtue manifests.
Forgotten are form and appearance;
Extinguished are mind and perception.
No dust clings to color;
The heart returns to truth.
The body rests in stillness;
The mind grows steadfast.
Fragrance and stench are equal;
The heart merges with emptiness.
Sweet and bitter are one;
The heart turns to substance.
The body feels abandoned;
The mind remains unshaken.
The will does not stray;
The heart does not scatter.
Ever concentrated,
The vital essence remains whole.

Use without limit,
Yet forget the means.

First, burn incense, gather the spirit, and sit upright, guarding **mǔ** (mother) with **zǐ** (child).
The spirit is the **qi**-child; **qi** is the spirit-mother.
With each inhalation and exhalation, govern the spirit over **qi**, circulating endlessly above and below, entering and exiting in soft continuity.

By day, open the ears and close the eyes;
By night, open the eyes and block the ears.

Whenever the mind stirs with inner or outer thoughts,
Suppress it with the mind.
Say: *"I am attending to [such-and-such], and will not indulge this thought."*
Simply count the breaths.

First, the mind stirs often, with little stillness—
Endure all phenomena without attachment.
Second, the mind is still, with few distractions—
Withdraw the mind into stillness.
Third, the mind is equally stirred and still.
Fourth, the mind is still, with few distractions.
Until spirit and **qi** merge as one,
Breath and the embryo unite,
And the mind remains purely still—
Then a single thought may arise.

First, practice silent morning reverence to the **Sān Yī** (Three-One) Dao,
Mastering silent reverence and petitioning with **bàizhāng** (white chapters).
When serving the **Xīnzhāng** (Heart Chapter), also silently petition above.
During samadhi, silently reverence—
And visions will appear.
Thus receiving the Emperor’s intent,
It is your own **Tiānzūn** (Celestial Venerable).
Why seek above when it is already within?

**Completion of the *Língbǎo Wúliàng Dùrén Shàngjīng* (Scripture of the Soul Treasure’s Infinite Salvation) – Volume 43, Volume 44.**

**The Chapter on Circulating Spirit and Merging with Visions**

First, meditate on the liver emitting **qīngqì** (green *qi*), transforming into a **Qīnglóng** (Azure Dragon) on the left.
The lungs emit **báiqì** (white *qi*), transforming into a **Báihǔ** (White Tiger) on the right.
The heart emits **chìqì** (red *qi*), transforming into a **Zhúquè** (Vermilion Bird) in front.
The kidneys emit **hēiqì** (black *qi*), transforming into a **Xuánwǔ** (Dark Tortoise) behind.
The spleen emits **huángqì** (yellow *qi*), transforming into a **Huánglóng** (Yellow Dragon) above the moon’s mansion.

Next, meditate on the left kidney emitting the **Shàngyuán Dàohuà Zhēn Jūn** (True Lord of Dao Transformation, Tang General), crowned with a **Fēitiān guān** (Flying Heaven Crown), clad in a **jiāngzhāng dān yī** (single garment of crimson chapters), wielding a **wǔsè jié** (five-colored banner), emerging from the left kidney through the left ear, standing to the left, thirty-two *zhàng* in height.

Next, meditate on the right kidney emitting the **Zhōngyuán Hùzhèng Zhēn Jūn** (True Lord of Upright Protection, Ge General), crowned with a **Fēitiān guān**, clad in a **jiāngzhāng dān yī**, wielding a **wǔsè duǎn** (five-colored standard), emerging from the right kidney through the right ear, standing to the right, equal in height.

Next, meditate on the **Xiàyuán Dìngzhì Zhēn Jūn** (True Lord of Steady Resolve, Zhou General), emerging from the heart through the mouth, standing in front, attired as before, his left hand holding a **yù jǐ** (jade spear), his right grasping a **jīn fú** (golden talisman), equal in height.

Make them all distinctly manifest.

Next, meditate on the **Shàngyuán Chìzǐ Níhuán Tiāndì Jūn** (Celestial Sovereign of the Vermilion Child, Níhuán), the **Zhōngyuán Gǎnggōng Zhēnrén Dānhuáng Jūn** (Dan-Huang True Person of the Crimson Palace, Middle Element), and the **Xiàyuán Huángtíng Yuánwáng** (Primordial King of the Yellow Court, Lower Element), all emerging from the **sāntián** (Three Fields), each positioned behind the three generals.

Then, preserve your own **yuánshén** (Primordial Spirit), clad in ritual attire and crown, ascending from the heart through the **Jīnquè** (Golden Gate) to the **Shàngyuán**, exiting via the **Míngtáng** (Bright Hall) in your own form and garments, standing clearly behind the **Sānyī** (Three-One).

Next, meditate on the **Liùdīng Dàshén** (Six Ding Great Deities), **Liùdīng Yùnǚ** (Six Ding Jade Maidens), **Liùjiǎ Dàshén** (Six Jia Great Deities), **Liùjiǎ Yùnǚ** (Six Jia Jade Maidens), **Fēitiān Wèizhēn Lì** (Flying Heaven Attendant Officials), **Chuányán Zòushì Lì** (Messenger Officials for Petitions), **Fēitiān Zhíshì Lì** (Flying Heaven Direct-Affairs Officials), the **Sānshíèr Tiān Xiùyī Yùtóng** (Thirty-Two Heavenly Embroidered-Robe Jade Boys), the **Wǔfāng Wǔlíng Tóngzǐ** (Five Directions’ Five Spirit Children), the **Sāntiān Shí Tiān Chéngshì Yùnǚ** (Three Heavens and Ten Heavens Attendant Jade Maidens), and the **Shàngzòu Língguān** (Supreme Petitioning Spirit Official), along with the **zhāngzhù** (ritual scriptures) and **fǎlù** (magisterial ranks) of celestial officials—both civil and martial—arrayed in proper order. Then perform the **Jiǔlíng Fēibù** (Nine Spirits’ Flying Steps).

**The Ritual of Presenting Petitions**
If the matter concerns the fate of a family, state, or living beings, you must proceed to the **Sāntiān Ménxià Nèicháo** (Inner Court beneath the Three Heavenly Gates).

**Completion:**
Preserve the **Wǔfāng Tàilíng Dòngyáng Wǔsè** (Five Directions’ Supreme Spirit Caverns’ Five Colors) in the five directions, forming a five-layered luminous halo. The **Sāntiān Tàiyī Zǐyún** (Three Heavenly Sovereign’s Purple Clouds) and **Xuányǐn** (Mysterious Canopy) envelop your body. Let the light descend into the **Níhuán**’s left **jiǔzhuǎn** (nine revolutions), then the heart’s right **jiǔzhuǎn**, merging with the **Dìzhái** (Imperial Residence) in three cycles—above and below.

Then, preserve the heart emitting **chìqì** (red *qi*), ascending to the heavens like a long rainbow.
Maintain your usual ritual posture, entering and circulating within the **chìqì**, ascending hundreds of *lǐ*, crossing the **huángdào** (Yellow Path) that intercepts the sun and moon—this is the **xīngjiè** (Star Domain).
Next, crossing westward into the northwest for another thousand *lǐ*, you glimpse **zǐyún** (purple clouds) faintly—this is beneath the **Sāntiān Ménxià** (Three Heavenly Gates). Then present your petition and submit the **jiǎn** (credentials) to the **Sānyuán Sānjiāngjūn** (Three Element Generals), who carry the credentials into the **Tiānmén** (Heavenly Gate).

After some time, the three generals emerge, conveying the decree permitting your audience.
Then, together with the three generals, the **Sānyī Zhēnshén** (Three-One True Deities), and your own **dānyuánshén** (Cinnabar Primordial Spirit), along with the petition documents, you enter the **Jīnquè Mén** (Golden Gate Gate).
Here, the realm is vast and indistinct—adapt and manifest accordingly.

Entering the **Tiānmén** toward the east, you reach the **Tàiyī Xuánshēng Zuǒfǔ** (Left Bureau of the Primordial Sovereign, Tàiyī), where you see the **Tàiyī Xuánshēng Dìjūn** (Sovereign Emperor of Primordial Generation). You recount your petition and reverence, presenting the **zhāng** (petition) and **zào zhuàng** (memorial statement) to the Emperor.
After nine prostrations, you turn westward into the **Tàihào Jīnmén** (Golden Gate of Great Clarity), where you see the **Sānshī** (Three Teachers) and the **Tiānshī** (Celestial Master), reporting the matters you have presented.
Then, proceed directly to the **Tàiqīng Tàijí Gōngmén** (Gate of the Supreme Clarity’s Supreme Polarity Palace), where the three generals, the **Sānyī Zhēnshén**, and your **yuánshén** stand.
After some time, a **Zhēnguān** (True Official) emerges from the palace gate, leading you into the **Tàiqīng Chónglóu Bǎodiàn** (Treasure Hall of the Supreme Clarity’s Lofty Tower), where a **jīnguāng tóngzǐ** (golden-light boy) and a **qīngyāo chéngyì yùnǚ** (jade-winged attendant maiden) stand beside the **Tàiyī Zhēnjūn** (True Sovereign of the Supreme One).
If the **Tàishàng** (Supreme Sovereign) has not yet descended to govern, the petition documents are handed to the **Tàiyī Zhēnjūn**, placed upon the **yù’àn** (jade case). After some time, you advance to await the imperial edict.

If the **Tàiyī** is governing, you see the **Chónglóu Yùdiàn Bǎitái Jīnlián Tàiqīng Shàngdì** (Supreme Emperor of Supreme Clarity seated upon the golden curtained dais of the jade-paved treasure hall). You present your petition below, and after the **Tàiyī Zhēnjūn** submits the documents, beneath the **Tàiqīng Yùxiàn** (Supreme Clarity’s Imperial Seal), the **Tàiyī Zhēnjūn** inscribes the **tiānzhuàn** (heavenly decrees) in **tiānzhuàn yún** (cloud-script).

When finished, the petition is sent to the **Tiānshěng** (Heavenly Registry) or **Tiān Cáo** (Heavenly Bureau), and you descend from the hall.
You perform nine prostrations below, then return to the **Dàhào Jīnlóu** (Great Clarity’s Golden Tower), where you petition the **zhūdé dào chún cōngshén** (various moral and virtuous celestial assemblies) for your request.
Together with the three generals and the **Sānyī Zhēnrén** (Three-One True Persons), you exit the **Jīnquè Mén**, returning to the **Fúzhāng** (petition’s resting place). If the **Tàishàng** has not yet descended to govern, the inner court ritual proceeds as before.
Finally, beneath the **Tiānzàng Huágài** (Heavenly Treasury’s Flower-Canopy), you return your spirit and await the response.

**The Efficacy of Petitions**
The **zhāng** (petition) opens the gates of the Nine Heavens and reaches the **Tàishàng’s** (Supreme Sovereign’s) throne.
It rescues from calamity, elevates from obscurity, and none surpass its power—it is the foremost method.
If a devout **jīngchéng dàoshì nǚguān** (ascetic male or female adept), detached from worldly affairs, who recites the scriptures without interruption, may present a petition to the heavens. Instantly, dangers are averted, and one may traverse the **yōumíng** (dim realm).
Thus, the **Tàishàng** descends commands to the celestial bureaus, transmitting them to the **yōumíng** (netherworld), ordering the relevant departments to register the name for a higher rebirth, removing them from the **sǐjí** (death ledger), extending their lifespan, and increasing the **kǎosuàn** (karmic calculations) of their **yōuhún** (netherworldly souls). Even those bound by **jūbàn yōumò** (netherworldly constraints) may be pardoned, their **zuìshū** (guilt registers) burned, and they attain a **shēngdào** (rebirth in the Dao).

For ordinary **zhāijiào** (ritual fasting), **qí’ēn** (petitions for blessings), **liáo zāi xièguò** (expiations for disasters and transgressions), the petition only reaches the **xīngjiè Tiānmén** (Star Domain’s Heavenly Gate), where **Zhōu Jiāngjūn** (General Zhou) and the **Zhí Rì Guān Lì** (Direct-Sun Officials) record the matters by category for submission.

If the **fǎshī** (ritual master) or **jìjiǎo** (sacrificial officiant) lacks **déxíng** (virtue and conduct), or if their **zāiqì** (impure *qi*) offends, they are consigned to their respective **chénghuángsī** (City Gods’ bureaus). If they are neither a **fǎshī jìjiǎo** nor one lacking virtue, they are often obstructed by **xiàguān gùqì** (low-ranking officials’ *qi*), or by the **bàntiān wǔyǒu xié shén** (half-heaven’s afternoon and evening malevolent deities), intercepted along the **yúnlù** (cloud path), and the petition never reaches its destination.

When ordinary sacrificial officiants and ritual masters act to save and heal the people, acting on behalf of Heaven to transform and enlighten, they are received by General Zhou of the Middle Realm and the Direct-Sun officials, who escort them to the **Tiānshū Yùan** (Celestial Pivot Bureau). Their petitions and memorials are then submitted alongside those from the ten thousand nations.

If errors are made, they are likewise sent to the City Gods’ bureaus. If they violate no statutes or fail to adhere to proper procedures, they are subject to Heaven’s own penalties.

When sacrificial officiants and ritual masters pray for the longevity of emperors and kings, avert wars and calamities, seek heirs, eliminate great harms, or universally save and deliver through supplication, their petitions are passed by General Zhou and General Ge to the **Sān Tiān Mén** (Three Heaven Gates). General Tang and the Direct-Sun officials convey them directly to the **Tiān Shěng** (Celestial Province), where they are immediately transcribed and swiftly awaited for a response.

If they can summon a **yángshén** (solar spirit) to personally present the memorials, they may go directly to the Three Heaven Gates, face the golden threshold, and humbly lay out their words in supplication, receiving direct edicts—thus exempting them from these regulations.

When practicing the **Língbǎo Dàfǎ** (Numinous Treasure Great Method), the **Sān Tiān Shí Tiān** (Three and Ten Heavens) receive the petitions through the **Yùnǚ** (Jade Maidens), the **Língguān Yùnshén Huìdào Gōngcáo** (Spirit Officials Assembling the Dao), the **Wèizhēn Shànglì** (Guardian Officials of Truth), the **Chuán Yán Zàoshì Xiānlì** (Messenger Celestial Officials), the **Jīnlóng Yì Lóngqí Lì** (Golden Dragon Relay’s Dragon Cavalry Officials), the **Lónghǔ Gōngcáo** (Dragon-Tiger Functionaries), the **Wǔsè Xiùyī Yùtóng** (Five-Colored Embroidered Robe Jade Boys), and the **Língfēi Liùjiǎ Yùnǚ** (Spiritual Flight Six Jia Jade Maidens), who transmit the memorials.

If there are mistakes or deviations from proper form, they are corrected at the Three Heaven Gates within the **Tiānxiàng** (Celestial Mirror), and the memorials are then transcribed anew. If they conform to the proper format, the memorials ascend immediately, for they have secured the **Sān Tiān Hé Tóng** (Three Heaven Concord) and the **Tàishàng Fúqiè** (Supreme Most’s Talismans), ensuring no obstruction.

For those drafting memorials, on the fifth day of the fifth month each year and on the **suìchú** (Year-End) day, silently recite the hidden name **"Línwù Ěr"** (three characters) of the Three Heavens ten thousand times within a day and night to receive the Three Heavens’ descending *qi*, aligning with the Concord. Before submitting a memorial, recite this name several hundred times, grind the ink, and invoke the *qi* of the Three Heavens upon the brush and paper. If writing the **Yùhào** (Imperial Title), recite it several dozen times. When rolling up the memorial, pass it over incense, and have an official seal it—recite several dozen times as well. This ensures swift ascent without delay.

When writing memorials, use pure paper, never placing them on beds or mats. The length should be one *chǐ* five *cùn*, with no more than twelve lines per sheet. In leap months, add a thirteenth line corresponding to the twelve months and twelve times. Each line should contain eighteen characters, connecting the Nine Heavens above with the Nine Earths below.

The titles **"Chén"** (Subject) and names must not be exposed, nor should feet be bare. Do not break or fold the subject’s name, nor write **"shēng"** (life) or **"sǐ"** (death) openly. Gods and ghosts must not be invoked by name. The **"dùntóu zàibài"** (kneeling prostration) must not disrupt the lines.

When mentioning the **"Tàisuì"** (Year Lord) and the subject’s surname, lower the first three characters. When mentioning the **"Zàibài"** (prostration), skip three lines, then write on the fourth. The same applies to the **"Dàoshén"** (Dao-spirit) and the subject’s surname. These lines stand above the rest, with eight *fēn* of space above and alignment with crawling ants below. Write with one or three breaths of *qi*, never exceeding three *cùn*. Skip three lines after the Year Lord, writing on the fourth. If the paper ends after the Year Lord, only one line remains—this may be continued onto a new sheet. Only after the **Sān Shī** (Three Teachers) have inscribed their praises does the memorial ascend.

When the subject is the sovereign, the child the parent, the wife the husband, the younger brother the elder, the grandson the ancestor, or the guest the host, the petition ascends without fail. Conversely, if the parent is the child, the sovereign the subject, the husband the wife, the ancestor the grandson, or the host the guest—though propriety and sincerity may be observed—even if the memorial ascends, the matter may only partially succeed. This must be carefully considered.

The method of drafting memorials begins with the sacrificial officiant or ritual master humbly confessing their unworthiness and failings in office. Then, they present the petitioner’s case, followed by an account of their transgressions and repentance. Next, they beseech mercy, pardon, and deliverance, and finally, they request official intervention. Avoid excessive or deceitful language, nor should hidden faults or falsehoods be concealed.

If this format is followed, the memorial will surely ascend and swiftly evoke divine response. If not, it will sink like a stone into the sea, yielding no spiritual efficacy, instead inviting retribution. How could there be blessings?

The common folk, ignorant of these principles, and greedy ritual masters who accept bribes for memorials—both bear fault. This must be approached with utmost caution.

The Three Heavens’ bureaucracy beneath the Celestial Gate is entirely under the jurisdiction of the **Yuqing Great Demon Kings** and the **Celestial Officials**, who oversee all matters. For instance, the **Tai Xuan Demon King** serves as the **Deputy Prime Minister**, while the **Lingmo** records deeds and misdeeds. This is not merely a demonic ledger—it is a **comparative reckoning of merit and fault**. The **Zhi Mo** (制魔) functions as the **Imperial Edicts Office**, akin to the **Hanlin Academy** of mortal realms.

To discern merit and fault with absolute precision—without moral failings—how could one attain such clarity? Moreover, the world lacks true talent. Most ritual masters merely follow outdated templates, writing memorials without regard for proper format or compliance.

Take the old memorial format: *"Encomiums belong solely to the Most High."* Yet if the memorial originates from the **Ta Qing officials**, it is submitted before the **San Tian Ta Qing Dongshen Jinque Supreme Lord Laozi**—but this is merely the **Ta Qing Tianzhong**, not the Most High. The **Most High’s Golden Gate** refers to the **Ta Qing Liaoyang Golden Gate**, hence the phrase *"Encomiums belong solely to the Most High."*

To the right, as in *"Your servant’s name"*—today’s ritual masters do not write *"Your servant [name]"* but instead *"[full name]"*, which is entirely improper.

Within these texts, there are **multiple violations of ritual precepts**—how could one uninitiated in **Zhenren** doctrine comprehend them?

For example, **Master Li Zhenren**, the enduring ritual master, composed memorials for the **Yang and Xu Zhenren**—only then was he deemed a true master. Later, he became the **Dongtian Master**, and now he has ascended to true office. How could the unworthy compare?

Later scholars, tracing his original texts, found them to be **authentic editions**, such as the *Qian Er Bai Guan Yi* or the *Tianshi Jingzhong Qingguan Jue*. When applied to practice, they align somewhat with **Heaven’s decree**.

When submitting memorials, if the format is correct, one must **kneel and present** incense, oil, firewood, rice, talismans, and ceremonial robes—according to one’s means, but never entirely lacking. If a vow is made and the matter is resolved, it must be repaid; one cannot neglect it.

In urgent cases, a **verbal memorial of gratitude** may suffice. If a written memorial is submitted, the reply must also be in writing—**no deviation is permitted**. If the **Celestial Tribunals** find no record of the case, **punishment will follow**.

For urgent memorials and **exorcism petitions**, ten sheets of **blue paper** must be knelt and presented—blue being the color revered by the Celestial Officials. This is a brief overview; **secret and detailed precepts are documented elsewhere**.

**Awaiting the verification of the Secret Edict.**

To practice this Dao, one must first enter **samādhi**, calming the six external senses—form, sound, scent, taste, touch, and phenomena—while internally subduing the ten evils, known as the three **karmic deeds** and the six sensory objects. When the three deeds arise, they must be immediately restrained by true awareness.

Gather and harmonize **jing** (essence), **qi** (vital breath), and **shen** (spirit), directing them into the **dantian**. The three deeds and six senses transform the yin-**qi** into pure yang, cultivating a robust, **buoyant** (乾健) body that aligns with the Dao, only then may one enter the realm of the spirit.

Wait within stillness until a divine light emerges—like the sun, or five-colored purple-**qi**, or crimson auspicious-**qi** descending to irrigate the **brain’s marrow** (泥丸), the heart, or the body. This is the true Dao-**qi** entering the body, called **tongsheng** (通生). **Tongsheng** is called **obtaining the Dao**. Though named thus, in truth, there is nothing obtained.

At the time of verification, one may **penetrate the true** and reach the spirit. Summoning the true spirit, visions and responses appear. Each morning and evening, recite the **Five Elements Rectifying Qi, Benefiting the Primordial, Communing with the Spirit Secret Incantation** a hundred thousand times. When the true spirit manifests, the mysterious visions and sounds appear—shaped in forms, materialized in objects.

The incantation:
**[Missing characters]** **[Missing characters]**, *urgent pipes convey the words*.
**[Missing characters]** **[Missing characters]**, *urgent pipes convey the words*.
*Red apricot, ink-black, grinding the true, stockings, Lingbao, urgent pipes bring it*.
*Xingsheng alone, Li Gong Du, cutting the horn, Han Ming, urgent pipes bring it*.
**[Missing characters]** **[Missing characters]**, *urgent pipes convey the words*.
**[Missing characters]** **[Missing characters]**, *urgent pipes convey the words*.
*Dou Lu Li Wei Deng Cui, urgent pipes bring it*.
Each time, recite until a hundred thousand repetitions are complete. The true spirit descends, revealing visions and penetrating the true.

At the time of verification, kneel and bow, first stabilizing the breath at the nose’s tip, calming the **qi** and spirit. In secret, pray:
*"Ten Heavenly maidens receive the jade offering, reporting to the Spirit Officials, the Flying Heavenly Guardians and True Clerks, transmitting words to the Celestial Messengers. The wind-cloud-**qi** and rain align straight, the Jade Scripture Functionary Godly Lord, bring the burned memorials to present them.*

*Witness the spirits bearing the burned memorials, the Jade Maidens and Functionaries clearly recorded. Together with the spirits, enter the two-inch **brow palace** (眉间洞房宫), then see the Teaching Master, the **Taicheng** (太清) King, and the Central **Huanglao** (黄老) Lord, seated in the **golden lotus jade hall**, the cloud-brocade yellow chamber. In yellow brocade embroidered robes, purple jade sashes, the **Taicheng** radiant multiform treasure-light, seated upon the seven-colored lotus, leaning on the **Taicheng** dragon-tiger jade desk. The **Taicheng** Spirit Officials, one hundred twenty in number, in crimson robes and dark caps, their jade axes arrayed on either side. The **Taicheng** jade boys, one hundred twenty in number, with double chignons, five-colored cloud-brocade robes, sashes and flying skirts, standing beside the Teaching Master.*

*Nine times, bow to the **Huanglao**, fully presenting the memorial’s intent. The Spirit Officials and Jade Maidens deliver the memorial, and the Teaching Master’s countenance smiles in approval. The Spirit Officials and Jade Maidens present the **Taicheng** purple phoenix divine brush, with gold ink writing the ‘approved’ characters. The Spirit Officials directly report to the Celestial Clerks to receive the memorials. Again, nine times, bow in gratitude, praying for a divine response.*

*The subject awaits at the case, listening for the sacred vision to appear. When finished, maintain a steady mind, silently reciting the **Three Heavenly Hidden Names** to guard the **central virtue** (中表德丘). Focus intently on the visions seen, verifying the response.*

*If not yet perfected, morning and evening, silently practice, accustomed to daily memorials. After completing the fast, incense offering, and silent memorial, burn the memorials, then place the ashes in a clean water vessel. Recite the incantation:*
*‘Heaven is clear, Earth is tranquil, yin and yang, the Five Phases. The Dao’s creation, all dharmas illuminated. The subject’s memorial now reaches the Divine Court. The Three Venerables decree, responses clearly manifest. Within the ashes, sacred words take form. Stir evenly, await the water’s settling, then take the unburned characters and the broken, un-dissolved characters from the ashes as the response.’*

**Secret Method for Communing with the True and Reaching the Spirit**
Hold great or small **jiao** (醮) rituals, offering to the Sacred True Ones. The High Functionary writes the secret heart-memorials according to the matter, hoping for distant transmission—words must be sincere and urgent.

First, state the intent, then enumerate the offenses, next confess guilt, then plead for protection, blessings, and fulfillment of wishes. Be concise and direct, avoiding conventional verbosity. If the memorial reaches above, nothing will fail to respond.

Also lead the **jiao** master’s memorials, together presenting them to the **Jingzhong** (靖中) altar for memorial.

When finished, together with the master, kneel before the Three Venerables’ incense burner and burn the memorials. When complete, await the ritual’s conclusion, offering the **science of the Three Venerables**, until the middle offering emits an unusual fragrance—or the tea, wine, or **qi** visibly descends. Examine carefully.

If it descends, immediately present the memorial’s intent, seeking verification. If it does not descend, send the spirit to present the memorial, praying for a response. Do not leave it unverified.

Nor should one misjudge the response—whether auspicious or inauspicious, chaotic or orderly—risking error or confusion. When the spirit returns, pray aloud, tapping the teeth three times:
*"Splitting the heart to present the memorial, offering it to the Three Heavens. What is prayed for is as desired, what is requested is as spoken. Guilt erased from the black register, the name inscribed on the green scroll. Illness and misfortune removed, ghosts and demons dispelled. The Celestial Officials descend, granting eternal longevity. The celestial boys and jade maidens transmit the report to the High Mysteries."*

When finished, tap the teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva five times, and with fierce fire, gaze toward the **heavenly gate** (天门) and burn it. Pray:
*"The Highest True Dao, opening salvation for all beings. The heart-memorial penetrates the Three Realms, swiftly reaching the Celestial Names. Relayed station by station, all wishes fulfilled."*

When finished, silently recite the **Three Venerables’ jade titles** nine times each, and according to the matter, the Heavenly Venerables. If for the state, additionally recite the **Sacred Ancestor Heavenly Venerable** nine times.

When the **jiao** concludes, return to the incense burner, nine times bow, and recite the incantation:

「朝向天灵台，暮宿九天来。连醮奏天回，消灭诸祸灾。
*Morning faces the Celestial Spirit Altar (Heavenly Gate), evening rests beneath the Nine Heavens. Through continuous *jiao* rites, the heavens are summoned in return, vanquishing all calamities and misfortunes.*

不以遍数，拜毕止，次还神，出户咒。
*Regardless of the prescribed repetitions, when the bowing is complete, cease and then return the deity, sealing the ritual with an incantation at the threshold.*

*The Sovereign Sage declares: The Soul-Treasure Great Method is the root Dao of Heaven and Earth, the wondrous *qi* of the Primordial Origin. Phoenix seals and Dragon scripts form the True Texts, and sacred sounds and dharmic chants are divided into incantations.*

*The Primordial Origin Emperor, perceiving the Principle of Formlessness, transmitted the essential mysteries to the Dao Sovereign Lord, to rescue and aid the multitude of confused beings, and to expound upon the Supreme Dao. These are not the common words of the world but the hidden names of the Celestial Realms.*

*The superior practitioner, when following this, can ascend and tread upon the Jade Capital.*

中士行之，可以迁居仙室。

*Even if one’s heart opens to divine awakening, wisdom renews daily, comprehending its secret sounds, penetrating the profound and reaching the principles, summoning deities and generals who appear before one, with the Three Realms revering in obedience and the Celestial Beings admiring in awe—this is the Dao that transforms life and the virtue that guides death.*

后之学者，多不遇真师，或传之於片纸文字，或得之於诵咏经诀。
*Later scholars often do not meet a True Master; some receive it only through fragments of text on paper, others through the recitation of scriptural secrets.*

思存未值要文，便言毕竟，矜夸己是，执着迷津。
*Before attaining the essential texts, they already claim ultimate mastery, boast of their own correctness, and cling to the confusion of the crossroads.*

盖缘行浅德微，福缘至薄。
*This is due to shallow practice, meager virtue, and exceedingly thin blessings.*

或得之於文绮华丽，或传之於符篆篇图，咒诀不全，符形靡辨，行持差误，呼想不真，以至将吏天真不能辅佐，皆去真就伪，象魔所试，其怨道者多矣。
*Some gain it through ornate and luxurious texts, others through talismanic seals and diagrams, but the incantations are incomplete, the talismanic forms indistinct, the rituals flawed, and the invocations insincere. Thus, even the generals and officers of the Celestial True Ones cannot aid them; all abandon truth for falsehood, succumbing to the trials of the Magical Realm, and many blame the Dao.*

殊不知灵宝秘文，法有伦序，符有诀窍，咒有秘章。
*Yet they do not know that the Soul-Treasure Secret Texts possess a hierarchical order in their methods, talismans have their essential keys, and incantations their hidden chapters.*

有制魔伏邪之宝文，有出死入生之心印，佩符肘印，谒简券符，诰帖环图，降魔戒誓，得之者即超登上道，飞谒玄元，度亡魂於时刻之中，济朽骨於吹嘘之内，城隍社令悉归掌握之中，风雨雷霆尽属指挥之部。
*There are texts that subdue demons and suppress evil, seals that rescue from death and bring forth life. Wearing talismans and practicing arm seals, presenting certificates and talismanic diagrams, and reciting edicts and circular seals—all these are oaths to subdue demons. Those who obtain them immediately transcend to the Supreme Dao, ascending in flight to the Primordial Origin, guiding lost souls within moments and reviving decayed bones through incantation. The City Deities and community orders are all brought under control, and the winds, rains, thunders, and lightnings obey their command.*

行道之士，先明於制御之法，其魔有十，故具于篇内。
*The practitioners of the Dao must first master the methods of suppression; there are ten kinds of demons, hence they are all included within this chapter.*

学者深而造之，勿为魔之所试，斯道不难成矣，得者秘若珍宝，不可轻露。
*Scholars must delve deeply and practice diligently, lest they be tried by the demons. Thus, the Dao is not difficult to achieve. Those who obtain it guard it as a precious treasure, not to be revealed lightly.*

如违盟约，则万劫堕於幽阴，永隔灵宝之光，祸延七祖。
*If one violates the covenant, then for countless kalpas one falls into the dark realm, forever separated from the light of the Soul-Treasure, and calamity extends to the seven ancestral generations.*

若能勤遵戒约，明守箴规，念念在法，通玄妙理，则魔王保举，万圣齐临，岂惟济接生死，久视之道，便可见矣。
*If one diligently adheres to the precepts, clearly guards the admonitions, and keeps the Dao ever in mind, penetrating its profound mysteries, then the Demon Kings will recommend them, and the myriad Saints will gather in attendance. Not only will they aid in life and death, but the Dao of eternal vision will also be seen.*

境化章
*The Chapter of Magical Realms.*

一曰天魔，二曰地魔，三曰人魔，四曰鬼魔，五曰神魔，六曰阳魔，七曰阴魔，八曰病魔，九曰妖魔，十曰境魔。
*First: Heavenly Demons, second: Earthly Demons, third: Human Demons, fourth: Ghostly Demons, fifth: Deity Demons, sixth: Yang Demons, seventh: Yin Demons, eighth: Sickness Demons, ninth: Fiend Demons, tenth: Magical Realms Demons.*

夫天魔者，修炼居山之士，一念纤尘，而被魔王之所败，而不能成真，何者。
*The Heavenly Demons: those practitioners refining the Dao in mountain dwellings, whose slightest thought of dust is defeated by the Demon King, preventing them from achieving true success. Why is this?*

正炼火丹，修真养浩，行持入靖，或目见显现形影，幢盖旛花，百种天香异云覆室，或耳闻仙乐之韵，此乃天魔之所试，即非正道之所履行也。
*When refining the Fire Elixir, cultivating the True Dao and nourishing the vast, entering the realm of tranquility, some may see the Demon King manifesting in form and shadow, banners and flags, myriad heavenly fragrances and strange clouds covering the hall, or hear the melodies of the Immortals. This is the trial of the Heavenly Demons, and it is not the path of the True Dao.*

可佩三皇内文及五帝消魔玉符，置於座前，左手搯中指中文，右手执五帝大魔之印照之，其魔自退，变神为元始天尊。
*One may wear the Inner Texts of the Three Sovereigns and the Jade Talismans of the Five Emperors to Dispel Demons, placing them before the seat. With the left hand holding the middle finger to the text, and the right hand grasping the Five Emperors’ Great Demon-Suppressing Seal and directing it toward the demons, the demons will retreat, and the deity will transform into the Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable.*

The Earthly Demon tests those who practice Dao/Way with their steps upon the *Gang* (磵, cosmic energy lines) and divine transformations. If their thoughts are impure or their recitations of talismans and spells are disordered, they are often assailed by Earthly Demons. How so? When one is striving to preserve the mind (*sìcún* 思存), doubts arise, and their recitation of talismans becomes chaotic, disrupting the essence of their heart-mind (*xīnyuán* 心元). Sometimes they see a form but fail to recognize its name, or a demon attaches itself to their body, rendering them speechless. They may oppose Daoist methods, defile sacred texts, and all these are not the acts of ordinary malevolent spirits (*xiéguǐ* 邪鬼), but rather the trials of Earthly Demons.

One should place the **True King of Celestial Clarity, Jade Purity** (神霄玉清真王) **Five-Direction Guardian Spirits Seal** (五方卫灵咒) upon the altar and burn the **Twelve-Character Heavenly Decree of the Unconquered Sovereign** (威未制天政德可伏御地祇敕十二字) to dispel them, and the demons will retreat.

As for Human Demons (*rénmó* 人魔), they afflict all who practice Dao/Way. Whether dwelling in mountains or entering chambers, if their recitation of talismans, their holding of spells, or their Daoist practices are marred by even a slight lapse in thought, they may be assailed by foul language, stench, and putrid odors; by disturbances from chickens, dogs, pregnant women, monks, nuns, or laypersons; by chaos in the ritual space, or even by the confusion of their own body and mind. Their preserved thoughts grow impure, talismans and spells fail to respond, and their incantations lose efficacy—these are all the trials of Human Demons.

One should place the **Mixed Seal of the Hundred Deities** (混合百神印) upon the altar, inscribe the **Four-Character Binding of Demon Essence** (束缚魔灵四字), and seal it with the impression. Then, burn it over incense and hold the **Left and Right Child-Yi Seals** (左右子亥二诀), reciting the **Three-Character Chapter of the Demon King** (魔王三品之章), and the demons will retreat.

Ghostly Demons (*guǐmó* 鬼魔) test those who practice Dao/Way, whether in the wilds or upon altars erected over the dead. If their thoughts are even slightly disordered, they may suffer nightmares of spectral apparitions, hollow wails, or strange beasts emerging—birds and rodents taking monstrous forms, serpents and insects displaying unnatural appearances—disturbing the true teachings and destroying sacred altars. These are all the trials of Ghostly Demons.

One should place the **Pure Clarity Law Master Seal** (浄明法主印) upon the altar, inscribe the **Four-Character Primordial Origin Pacification** (元始安镇四字), and seal it with the impression. Affix it to the altar and then recite the **Pure Clarity Sacred Scripture** (浄明灵书) **twice** (二徧), and the demons will retreat.

Divine Demons (*shénmó* 神魔) test those who practice Dao/Way, whether in exorcism, temple destruction, or summoning spirits and souls. If their thoughts grow reckless, they are often assailed by Divine Demons. Sometimes these demons manifest in form and shadow, speak in voices, hurl stones and swirling winds, blow horns and weep, taking countless strange shapes. They may steal ritual offerings from the altar, pilfer secret alchemical formulas, and harass the practitioner’s body and mind without cease—these are all the trials of Divine Demons.

One should wear the **Austerely Summoning Seal of Northern Fú** (严摄北酆印) upon the elbow, invoking the **Black Range Deities** (玄范众真) to subdue them. Then, inscribe the **Eight-Character Divine Official Receives Command, Universally Sweeping Away Inauspiciousness** (神公受命普扫不祥八字) and affix it to the four directions of the altar. Next, burn the **Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns’ Sacred Names Chapter** (三十二天帝讳章) before the chamber and dispel them, and the demons will retreat.

As for Yang Demons (*yángmó* 阳魔), when practitioners seek inner cultivation to transcend life and death, if their thoughts are not pure, lustful desires arise, along with resentment and hatred. They may be ensnared by emotional attachments, tormented by anxieties, or embroiled in disputes—these are the trials of Yang Demons.

One should purify the mind and silently recite the **Nine-Voice Chapter of the Heavenly Venerable Who Subdues Demons and Extinguishes Evil** (降魔灭恶天尊九声), striking the teeth three times. Then, inscribe the **Eight-Character Golden Scenery, Mysterious Fusion of Qi into the Profound Profound** (八景冥合炁入玄玄), burn it, and ingest the ashes. Next, wear the **Five-Direction Seal of the Jade Talismans to Subdue Demons** (五方制魔玉文), recite the **Five-Direction Demon-Subduing Spell** (五方制魔咒), and perform the **Gang Seals of the Revolving Dipper and Arrow Constellations** (旋斗历箕罡诀), and the demons will retreat.

As for Yin Demons (*yīnmó* 阴魔), those who dwell in mountains and study secret texts may, at the moment of preserving the mind or entering a chamber, suffer a lapse in thought and suddenly hear mournful songs from the four directions, cold winds howling chaotically, or their vision inverted, giving rise to false cravings and anger. They may utter nonsensical words or reveal taboo names of the dead. Even when walking the roads, they may encounter monks and bloodstained corpses, provoking disgust and aversion toward the radiance of their own spirit—these are all the trials of Yin Demons.

One should strike the teeth seven times, hold the **Midday Seal as the Spell** (午文为诀), and preserve the **Primordial Origin’s Mysterious Qi** (玄元之炁), infusing it into the body. Next, ingest the **Eight-Character Chapter of the Five Elders Opening the Seal, Assisting the Deities in Their Chariots** (五老启涂群仙翼辕八字), sealing it with the **Five Emperors’ Great Demon-Suppressing Seal** (五帝大魔之印). Additionally, wear the **Five-Element Jade Talisman of the Five Beginnings** (童初五元玉册), recite the **Lower Section of the Sacred Scripture** (灵书下篇), and burn the **Dragon Chapter and Phoenix Seal Texts** (龙章凤篆之文), and the demons will retreat.

As for Illness Demons (*bìngmó* 病魔), when practitioners falter in thought, the **Four Great Elements** (四大) lose harmony, and their diet or exposure to cold and heat becomes imbalanced, they often fall ill with lingering diseases that impair their practice—these are the trials of Illness Demons.

One should place the **Five Demon-Subduing Talismans** (消魔五符) within the chamber, use the **Five Emperors’ Great Demon-Subduing Seal** (五帝大魔之印), recite the **Pure Clarity Sacred Scripture** (浄明灵书) **twice** (二徧), ingest the **Eight-Character Golden Scenery, Mysterious Fusion of Qi into the Profound Profound** (八景冥合炁入玄玄), and also burn the **Two Pure Clarity Talismans for Extending Life** (浄明延生二符). Wear the **Jade Talisman of the Primordial Cavern** (元洞玉历章), strike the teeth to gather the spirit, confess faults and atone for sins, and then, facing the sacred, burn incense to invoke the **Cloud Penjia Treasure Sign Chapter** (云笈宝签科品), harmonizing the **Two Spirits of Yin and Yang** (阴阳二神), and the demons will retreat.

As for **Fiendish Demons** (*yāomié* 妖魅), they abound in mountains and forests. Those who enter seclusion for cultivation, if their thoughts are not pure, will often attract fox spirits, mountain demons, stone monsters, and fiendish apparitions, which fear their attainment of the Dao and may transform into seductive illusions to seek sustenance. They may also sing alluring verses to manifest in form and shadow.

Thus, practitioners of the Great Law often hold them in dread. One should steadfastly uphold the will of **Gold and Stone** (金石), extinguish thoughts and halt idle speculations, recite the **Three-Character Chapter of the Demon King** (魔王三章), and perform the **Seals of the Ten-Direction Flying Heavenly Kings** (十方飞天神王诀), directing the **Heavenly Treasure Sovereign Seal** (天宝君印) toward them. Next, burn the **Five Emperors’ Great Demon-Subduing Talismans** (五帝大魔符) before the chamber. Then, burn incense and ascend the seat, proclaiming the **Three Caverns Sacred Law** (灵宝三洞法语), and the demons will retreat, never returning again. Moreover, one should offer **a hundred measures of food** (斛食) to them.

As for **Boundary Demons** (*jìngmó* 境魔), during the course of practice, if one encounters a thing upon the road or in a secluded chamber and their thoughts give rise to craving or anger, or if one enters a chamber and perceives strange *qi* phenomena or spectral apparitions, these are all the trials of Boundary Demons.

To the practitioner, it is essential to **concentrate the heart and purify the thoughts**, preserve the **qi** and focus the **mind**, allowing it to embrace the **True Essence of the Great Void** (太虚之真), so that within and without, it becomes **luminous and transparent**, like **lapis lazuli** (瑠璃), untouched by any defilement.

Within the **emptiness** (空) lies a **treasure** (宝), radiant and all-pervading, to which the **Ten Directions** (十方) come to pay homage. It also **swallows and neutralizes** the **hidden secrets of all the heavens** (诸天隐讳). By reciting the **Pure Clarity Treasure Sutra** (浄明宝经) once, and wearing the **Supreme Purity Nine Elders’ Seal of Demon-Subjugation** (上清九老伏魔之印), the demons will retreat.

「With gratitude to the subtle and profound, the great spirit ascends.
Summoning the myriad **qi**, gathering in the Radiant Hall.
Dispelling a hundred demons, flourishing in harmony with the Dao.
Preserving salvation and averting calamities, extinguishing trials and removing afflictions.
This scripture is paired with the Yellow Emperor’s Great Talisman,
to harmonize with the numinous and merge with transformations,
sharing equal authority in its function.

**Scripture of the *Thinking Spirit Ritual* (思神仪诀品)**

The Host’s Opening:
On the eve before the solemn fast, at the **Hài hour** (亥时), erect the altar, set the offerings,
and perform the rites of supplementing titles and declaring precepts,
proclaiming the discipline to inspire the assembly,
and sealing the covenant with the Three Realms.
This is the night for the Host’s Opening,
but not the day for the solemn fast’s ritual of the Dao.

The **Xuan Master** (玄师) says:
At dawn the next day, the ritual of the Dao is performed,
and the Host’s Opening is extended until the day’s appointed hour arrives.
The morning rites and the Host’s Opening, though conducted early,
do not fall within the proper time for the solemn fast’s Dao ritual.

All who fast must bathe on the day before,
and take their places in the **Host’s Hall** (斋所).
At the **Hài hour** (亥时) on the appointed day,
the assembly gathers in solemn array,
and the High Function Master (高功法师) is summoned to stand before the **Xuan Master** (玄师) and **Tian Master** (天师).
The Fast Official (斋官) burns incense,
and the High Function Master recites the Fast’s invocation,
then the High Function Master reports the Fast’s intent before the Master.
The High Function Master then performs the ritual of the Dao,
the **Knowing Gong** (知磬) chants the Dao,
and the **Knowing Flute and Summer** (知炉华夏引) leads the procession.
The High Function Master stands at the altar’s foot and awaits the command.

Next, the High Function Master commands the altar,
then the **Knowing Gong** raises the **Flute and Summer** (华夏引) and leads the procession,
while the High Function Master ascends to the altar’s threshold.
Then the High Function Master knocks his teeth three times,
recites the **Entering the Threshold Incantation** (入户咒),
and performs the **Transformation of the Spirit Ritual** (变神诀),
raising two fingers at the **upper joint** (上节).
After the incantation is finished,
he ascends the altar in a single clockwise circuit,
then the second level in a single clockwise circuit,
and finally stands facing west in sequence.
Next, the High Function Master ascends the inner altar,
facing west, sets up the incense case, and strikes the **Ritual Beads** (诀),
invoking the Three Masters.

Then the **Knowing Gong** raises the **Flute and Summer** (华夏引) and leads the procession,
while the High Function Master offers incense to the Ten Directions.
Next, the High Function Master proceeds to the **Tianbao Platform** (天宝台),
offers incense to the **Cavernous Case** (洞案), and recites the invocation.
The **Taqing Ritual Beads** (太清诀) are struck with the middle finger at the **upper joint** (上节).
Then the High Function Master returns to his original position,
facing east in long kneeling,
and offers incense from the **Hand Flute** (手炉香) with invocation.

The **Shangqing Ritual Beads** (上清诀) are struck next,
and the **Knowing Gong** raises the **Flute and Summer** (华夏引) for the **Grand Lecture** (都讲),
while each attends the Master in accordance with the ritual.

The **Yuqing Ritual Beads** (玉清诀) are struck in accordance with the Three Masters’ rites.
The essence of the ritual lies in honoring the Masters,
for without the Masters, how could the Dao be attained?
The Masters referred to are:
The **Fast Master** (度师) of the mortal realm,
the **Evening Master** (夕师) of the Fast Master, called the **Ledger Master** (籍师),
and the **Ledger Master’s** Master, called the **Scripture Master** (经师).

**Ritual of Thinking the Spirit (思神仪法)**

At **Zǐ hour** (寅时) of dawn,
think upon the **Green Qi** (青炁) emerging from the liver,
ascending like clouds,
encircling the altar and hall.
The **Azure Dragon** (青龙) and **Lion** (狮子) guard the front and rear,
while **Celestial and Earthly Immortal Children** (仙童), **Jade Maidens** (玉女),
**Day, Moon, Stars, and Constellations** (日月星宿),
the **Five Emperors and Great Demons** (五帝大魔),
and the **Ten-Directional Divine Kings’ Armies** (十方神王兵马)
supervise the Fast and attend directly,
with the **Three Realms’ Officials** (三界官属) arrayed on either side.
Then recite the **Five Stars’ Grand Invocation** (五星都咒).

At **Wǔ hour** (午时),
think upon the **Red Qi** (赤炁) emerging from the heart,
ascending like clouds,
encircling the altar and hall.
The **Vermilion Bird** (朱雀) and **Phoenix** (凤凰) guard the front and rear,
while **Celestial and Earthly Immortal Children** (仙童), **Jade Maidens** (玉女),
**True Immortals of the Three Realms** (三界真仙),
**Day, Moon, Stars, and Constellations** (日月星宿),
the **Five Emperors and Great Demons** (五帝大魔),
and the **Ten-Directional Divine Kings’ Armies** (十方神王兵马)
supervise the Fast and attend directly,
with the **Officials of the Ten-Thousand Spirits** (万灵官属) arrayed on either side.
Then recite the **Command the Demon Spirits’ Invocation** (命魔神咒).

At **Hài hour** (亥时) when the mortal realm rests,
think upon the **White Qi** (白炁) emerging from the lungs,
ascending like clouds,
encircling the altar and hall.
The **Qilin** (麒麟) and **White Tiger** (白虎) guard the four directions,
while **Celestial and Earthly Immortal Children** (仙童), **Jade Maidens** (玉女),
**True Immortals of Heaven and Earth** (天地真仙),
**Day, Moon, Stars, and Constellations** (日月星宿),
the **Five Emperors’ Armies** (五帝兵马),
and the **Fast’s Supervising Officials** (监醮香官),
**Three Realms’ Officials** (三界官属) arrayed on either side.
Then recite the **Five Stars’ Grand Invocation** (五星都咒) again.

Close your eyes and inwardly think upon the **Five Stars**, **Five True Ones**, and **Five Emperors**,
guarding your very being.
The **Golden Radiance** (金华) illuminates your entire form,
your body turning golden,
and from the lungs, a radiant sphere ascends to the crown,
like the sun’s image,
to brighten the Ten Directions,
so that within your body, all is clear,
and you perceive both inner and outer realms.
This method is used for the three periods of day and night in the Dao ritual.

**Striking the Ritual Beads (呜法鼓) twenty-four times**

**Knocking Teeth Ritual (叩齿法):**
Knocking left to right is the **Celestial Bell** (天钟),
knocking right to left is the **Celestial Gong** (天磬),
and knocking in the center is the **Law Drum** (法鼓).

**Ritual of the Hand Flute’s Spirit Emission (发炉出神诀):**
At **Sǎo hour** (卯) to **Chén hour** (辰), the **Three-Five Functionaries** (三五功曹)
and the **Left and Right Officials** (左右官使者) attend.
From **Chén hour** (辰) to **Wǔ hour** (午), the **Left and Right Incense Bearers** (左右捧香)
and the **Dragon-Cavalry Brides** (驿龙骑吏) attend.
From **Wǔ hour** (午) to **Shěn hour** (申), the **Golden Attendants** (金童) bear incense.
From **Yǒu hour** (酉) to **Xū hour** (戌), the **Jade Maidens** (玉女) scatter flowers and deliver messages.
At **Xū hour** (戌), the **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans** (五帝直符) are invoked.
At **Hài hour** (亥), the **Day Incense Officials** (日香官) attend directly.

From **Chén hour** (辰) to **Wǔ hour** (午), strike the **Wheel of Heaven Beads** (轮诀).
Next, burn and emit the **Hand Flute Talisman** (发炉符),
and proclaim the **Four Sacred Characters of the Spirit’s Manifestation** (敷落神真四字).」

**Official Talismans and Ritual Sequence**

The **Five-Body True Officials and Functionaries** are invoked:
At **Mǎo hour** (卯), the **Celestial Officials and Direct Messengers of the Upper Immortal** (上仙上灵直使) attend.
At **Yǒu hour** (酉), the **Direct Functionaries of the Rectified One** (正一功曹) are summoned.
At **Zǐ hour** (子), the **Left and Right Officials of the Heart** (心左右官使者) appear.
At **Wǔ hour** (午), the **Yin-Yang Divine Decision Officials** (阴阳神决吏) are present.
At **Chǒu hour** (丑) and **Yín hour** (寅), the **Science-Carrier Officials of the Vermilion Talisman** (科车赤符吏) attend.
At **Chén hour** (辰) and **Sì hour** (巳), the **Gang-Wind Cavalry Station Officials** (罡风骑置吏) are deployed.

**Gèn** (艮) invokes the **Three Officials’ Attendants in Heavenly Armor** (三官仆射天绉甲卒).
**Zhèn** (震) calls the **Heavenly Ding Warriors** (天丁力士).
**Xùn** (巽) and **Lí** (离) and **Kūn** (坤) and **Duì** (兑) summon the **Supervisory Officials of the Heavenly and Earthly Stems and Branches** (弹监察考召甲子诸官君).

From **Zǐ hour** (子) to **Hài hour** (亥), the **Wheel Talismans** are struck.

**Reigniting the Furnace and Invoking the Spirit Talismans**
Enter the **Spirit Talismans** from the **Twelve Constellations** (子轮十二宫), fixing the **Middle Finger’s Central Seal** (中指中局定) at the **Heart Center** (当心), storing the **Inhaled Qi** (存入服炁), and swallowing it into the **Elixir Field** (丹田).

When the **Three Canon Fast** is observed and the **Furnace is reignited**, the **Court Officials of the Primordial Dao** (洞元朝仪吏兵) are summoned.
If the **High Functionary** (高功) has separately received scriptures and talismans, he must follow the prescribed **Law Officials** (法职) and summon the **Court Officials** (吏兵) at the time of reigniting the furnace.

**The Ten Directions’ Ritual Order**
The **Ten Directions** are honored in sequence: beginning with the **North**, then **Northeast**, **East**, **Southeast**, **South**, **Southwest**, **West**, **Northwest**, **Upper**, and **Lower**.
For the **North** is where the **Supreme Spirits and Stars** gather in reverence, thus the **North is first honored**.

Upon completing the **Furnace Reignition**, the **Court Precepts are proclaimed**, the **Altar is lowered**, and the **High Functionary** is led to the **Earth Portal** (地户) to stand in order. The **High Functionary recites the Exit Portal Incantation** (出户咒).
Next, the **High Functionary offers incense before the Mysterious Teacher** (玄师), declares purity, and recites the **Meritorious Returning Prayers** (回向念善).
When finished, the **Keeper of the Bell** (知磬) announces the completion of the **Daoist Assembly Rites** (云道场法事毕), and the **Officials return to their stations**.

**The Imperial Altar Meditation Rite**
The **Imperial Altar Rite** begins by placing **Water and Sword** (水剑) at the **Earth Portal** (地户). A **Dignified Daoist** (有威仪道士) is selected, bearing the **Altar Tablet** (坛简), to stand before the **Water and Sword**.
The **Earth Portal** is where **Heavenly and Earthly Qi** first emerge, and all things enter and exit. Thus, the **Southeast** is the **Extreme Yang**, generating **Yin**, and is the **Earth Portal**. The **Northwest** is the **Extreme Yin**, generating **Yang**, and is the **Heavenly Gate**.
Therefore, the **Method of Revering the True** in cultivation always **abandons Yin and seeks Yang**.

First, **close the eyes** and visualize the **Three Teachers of the Scriptures** (经籍度三师) facing **West**.
Next, visualize the **Upper Immortal Concealing-Body Great General** (上仙蔽身大将军), surnamed **Táng**, named **Hóng**, with the courtesy name **Wénmíng**, wearing a **Crimson-Capped, Vermilion-Crowned Celestial Hat** (朱明赤帻通天大冠), **Crimson Robes with Vermilion Sash**, and a **Dragon-Headed Jade Sword** in his left hand, holding a **Golden Talisman** in his right.
Next, visualize the **Upper Mysterious Concealed-Shadow Great General** (上灵隐影大将军), surnamed **Gě**, named **Yōng**, with the courtesy name **Wéndù**, wearing a **Sun-Yang Green-Accumulated Celestial Hat** (朱阳青积通天之冠), **Crimson Silk Robes**, and holding a **Jade Spear**.
Next, visualize the **Upper Spirit Concealing-Form Great General** (上神藏形大将军), surnamed **Zhōu**, named **Wǔ**, with the courtesy name **Wénɡǎng**, wearing a **Sun-Yang Crimson-Capped Celestial Hat** (朱阳赤帻通天之冠), **Crimson Robes with Vermilion Sash**, and holding the **Jade Yang Scepter**.
Visualize the **True Officials** before them, clad in **Crimson Garments**, riding **Nine Phoenixes**.

Next, **step into the Impurity-Smashing Array** (破秽斗), visualizing the **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper** covering one’s head, with the **Dipper Handle pointing forward**, without obstructing the ears or eyes.

Next, **declare the Legal Stations** (方称法位) and **announce the Fast’s Intent** (关白斋意).
After three **Bowings**, the **Altar Tablet is lowered**, the hands are **clasped firmly**, and the **Four Spirits** are summoned.
The **Four Spirits** are **Dragon, Tiger, Vermilion, and Dark** (龙虎朱玄).
With the **left hand striking the Zhèn-Mǎo Talismans** (震午二诀), visualize the **Liver and Heart Qi**, transforming the form to stand before.
With the **left hand blowing and striking**, the **right hand strikes the Yǒu-Zǐ Talismans** (酉子二诀), visualizing the **Lung and Kidney Qi**, transforming the form to stand behind.
With the **right hand blowing and striking**, next, **both hands cup the Heart**, standing in the **Ding-Step Array** (履丁字立), reciting the **Summoning the Three Officials Incantation** (召三官咒), stepping **three Ding-Step Array paces** toward the **Sword-Water Station** (剑水所).
Then, striking the **Five-Direction Talismans** (五方诀), the **Five Dragons are summoned**. Only then does one face the **Sword-Water**, holding the incantation and purifying the altar.
Upon completion, at the **Human Gate** (人门), step the **Yǔ-Step Array** (禹步罡) to the **Ghost Portal** (鬼户), **sheathing the Sword** and retreating.
Then, **three bowings** are performed, the **middle finger is struck**, visualizing the **Spirits returning to True Qi**, and the **Essence is restored to the Original Form**.

**Reciting the Mouth Talismans**
The **Liver Qi** corresponds to the **Wood Star**, located in the **East**, as **Green Qi**. All matters of **Wood and Eastern Green Qi** are governed by it.
The **Lung Qi** corresponds to the **Metal Star**, located in the **West**, as **White Qi**. All matters of **Metal and Western White Qi** are governed by it.
The **Heart Qi** corresponds to the **Fire Star**, located in the **South**, as **Red Qi**. All matters of **Fire and Southern Red Qi** are governed by it.
The **Kidney Qi** corresponds to the **Water Star**, located in the **North**, as **Black Qi**. All matters of **Water and Northern Black Qi** are governed by it.
The **Spleen Qi** corresponds to the **Earth Star**, located in the **Center**, as **Yellow Qi**. All matters of **Earth and Central Yellow Qi** are governed by it.

The **Upper Field** (上田) governs the **Mud Pillow Palace** (泥丸上清宫). All matters of the **Upper Pure Palace** (上清宫) are governed by it.
The **Middle Field** (中田) governs the **Vermilion Palace and Jade Pure Palace** (绛宫玉清宫). All matters of the **Jade Pure Palace** (玉清宫) are governed by it.

**The Mixed Sun-Moon Method**
The **Three Fields** of a person all contain **True Soil**. After **Zǐ hour** (子), gather the **True Qi of the Left and Right Kidneys** in the **Lower Field Elixir Field** (下田丹元), visualizing it as **five colors**, coiled within a **single pill**. Merge it with the **True Qi of the Mud Pillow**.
Then, descend from the **Jade Terrace** (玉楼) to the **Yellow Court** (黄庭), blending with the **Heart Qi**.
Again, circulate upward from the **Spinal Column**, passing through the **Mud Pillow**, then descending back to the **Yellow Court**.
Visualize a **Heavenly Venerable One** in the **Yellow Court**, shaped and attired like oneself.
This **True Qi** moves from **Zǐ hour to Wǔ hour**, performing this three times.
After **Wǔ hour**, use the **Heart Fire** to descend into the **Yellow Court**, imagining the **Heavenly Venerable One seated in the Great Fire**, motionless, adhering to the **Seated Forgetting Method** (坐忘法).

**The Returning Breath Method**
With each **exhalation**, let it arise from the **Elixir Field**, storing the **breath** and directing it into the **Yellow Court**, as if the **Heavenly Venerable One** swallows it.
With each **inhalation** through the nose, likewise store the **breath** in the **Yellow Court**, as if the **Heavenly Venerable One** swallows it.

**The Method of Revering the Primordial (朝元法)**
Store the **Upper, Middle, and Lower Three Fields**, each containing a **Heavenly Venerable One**.
Then store the **Lower and Middle Two Heavenly Venerables**, riding upon the **Five-Colored Cloud Qi**, ascending together with the **Self-Spirit in the Yellow Court** from the **Vermilion Tower**, ascending straight to the **Cinnabar Field**.
Store the **Three Seated Venerables** all within the **Jade Circuit**, with the **Self** kneeling long before them in the **Jade Circuit**, presenting petitions.
Upon completion, store the **Three Pure Ones of the Three Pure Realms**, riding upon the **Three-Colored Cloud Qi** to the **Cinnabar Field**, merging with the **Three Field Heavenly Venerables** of the Self, thus forming **Three Venerables**.
Then store these **Three Venerables** as one, this **One Venerable** riding upon the **Five-Colored Cloud Qi**, descending from the **Vermilion Tower** into the **Yellow Court** to dwell, and then practicing the **Method of Stillness**.

**The Scripture-Recitation Method**
The **First Month** is the **Upper Primordial**, and from the **Eleventh to the First Month**, all recitations are stored in the **Upper Palace Heavenly Venerable** as scriptures.
The **Seventh Month** is the **Middle Primordial**, and from the **Second to the Seventh Month**, all recitations are stored in the **Middle Palace Heavenly Venerable** as scriptures.
The **Tenth Month** is the **Lower Primordial**, and from the **Eighth to the Tenth Month**, all recitations are stored in the **Lower Palace Heavenly Venerable** as scriptures.

Whenever reciting scriptures, one must practice the **Method of Stillness**, then listen intently with the **Ears** to the **Heavenly Venerable’s** recitation—clear and resonant like bell tones.

For **petitions and exorcisms**, use the **Upper Palace**.
For **cultivating qi**, use the **Lower Palace**.
For **rites for the deceased**, use the **Middle Palace**.

**Reciting Scriptures for Others**
When performing petitions or reciting scriptures for others, store the **Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Cinnabar Palace** descending from the **Cinnabar Palace**, then gather the **supplicant’s yang soul** to receive the scripture. The **Primordial Heavenly Venerable** bestows the **Scripture Classic**, just as with the **Dao Sovereign**.

**The Flying Petition Method**
**Black (1), Red (2), Green (3), White (4)**
First, store the **Self-Spirit** from the **Yellow Court**, then store the **Five-Colored Clouds** ascending directly from the **Jade Tower** to the **Cinnabar Field**.

Then store the **Self** ascending the **Seven Stars** from the **Cinnabar Field**, step by step, following the stars upward, feeling the body lift far from the earth within the **Great Cloud Qi**.
Then store the **Self** taking **horizontal steps** across the **Seven Stars**, turning the body into the **Fighter’s Mouth**, advancing **six steps**.

Store the **Self** facing south with the back to north, proceeding to the **Fire Star**, storing **red**.
Passing the **Fire Star**, move eastward, storing **red** as passing the **Day Official’s** domain.
Passing the **Day Official’s** domain, move westward, storing **white** as passing the **Moon Palace**.
Passing the **Moon Palace**, turn left **seven times** toward the southwest, then exit, traversing the **stars of the southeast**, arriving at the **northeast corner**.
Then reverse direction, traversing the **stars of the northwest, southwest, and east**, returning to the **northeast corner**.
Then face east, circling **Kui Star** once, ascending directly toward the **Fire Star**.
Passing the **west**, encounter the **Metal Star**, storing **white**.
Passing the **Metal Star**, move north to the **Water Star**, storing **black**.
From the **Water Star**, pass the **east**, encountering the **Wood Star**, storing **green**, then return to the **Water Palace** from the **Wood Star**, passing the **Metal Star** again westward, straight to the **Central Palace’s Earth Star**, storing **yellow**.
Then from the **Earth Star**, return to the **Metal Star, Water Star**, and arrive at the **Wood Star’s** domain.
From the **Wood Star’s** domain, ascend northwestward on the clouds, sighting the **Golden Gate**.

The **True Qi** within the human body merges with the **Heavenly Qi**.
Since humans are born from the womb, the **fetal body** receives **malevolent qi**, mingling with the **True Qi**.
Thus, the human body contains **twelve knots** and **thirty-nine death gates**.
First, dissolve the **twelve knots** and **thirty-nine death gates**, allowing the **True Qi** to ascend and communicate with Heaven.
To dissolve the **knots**, summon the **Qi of Dao Father and Dao Mother**, first dissolving the **Lower Field’s knots**, then the **Middle Field’s**, and finally the **Upper Field’s**.
Each **Field** has **four knots** sealing the **death gates**.

To seal the **death gates**, summon the **Thirty-Nine Heavenly Pure Qi**, beginning from the **Lower Field** and ending at the **Upper Field**.
Each **Field** has **thirteen death gates**.
After dissolving the **knots**, merge the **Qi of Dao Father and Dao Mother** into one body, returning to the **Yellow Court**.
After sealing the **death gates**, merge the **Thirty-Nine Heavenly Pure Qi** into one body, called **Emperor One**.
This is the **True Nature of Man**, returned to the **Yellow Court**.

Dissolving the **knots** follows the **Scripture for Dissolving Knots**, and sealing the **death gates** follows the **Thirty-Nine Great Chapters of the Perforation Method**, blending **Yong-Yi and Hui-Feng’s** techniques.

For **treating diseases and expelling malevolence**, first summon the **Five Battalions, Five Emperors, and Five Demons** to pacify the **Five Viscera**, preserve life, generate **saliva**, and expel **malevolent qi**.

When using these **talismans**, first perform the **Method of Revering the Primordial**, summoning the **True Qi**, and clearly stating the **patient’s illness** and the **purpose of the talisman**.

For **treating diseases**, use the **Five Battalions** to perform the talisman, then after half a month, perform the **Method of Revering the Primordial** again, harmonizing the **Five Qi**, blending the **Hundred Gods’ talismans**, and instructing the patient to swallow them, pacifying the **Yellow Court**.

For **expelling malevolence**, only recite the **Heart Chapter** once, distinguishing between **human and ghostly qi**, ensuring no **guilt of ghosts or gods** is incurred.

For all **treatments and exorcisms**, the **Heavenly Venerable** from the **Yellow Court** resides in the **Cinnabar Field**, merging the **Qi of the Five Viscera** within the **Mixed Primordium**.

When **daily affairs are nonexistent**, dwell long in a **quiet chamber**, burning incense and focusing the mind, ensuring the **Spirit** does not depart the body. Only then can one perform the **Method of Revering the Primordial** and **Flying Steps**, communicating with the **mysterious and dark**.

The **Heart Chapter** may only petition **one matter**, and one must not speak beforehand—only **declare clearly**, petitioning the **Empty and Natural Jade Gate**.

With reverence, through the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**, the **Incense-Bearing Golden Boys**, the **transmission by the Jade Maiden**, the **Left and Right Incense Officials and Messengers**—all **pure and correct spirits**—and the **Expediter of Qi Affairs**, the **Flying Petition** is carried out.

Before the **petition**, leave blank paper, stamped with the **Yellow God Seal**.
After the **petition**, leave blank paper, stamped with the **Yue Seal**, to be burned in the **great incense burner**.

Store the **Method of Revering the Primordial** three times.
The **first time** petitions the **desire to present the petition**.
The **second time** petitions the **intention within the mouth**.
The **third time** stores the **Heavenly Venerable’s** resolution of the petition.

**The Method of True Stillness**

For the Dao of observing the mind, one must inwardly observe the mind—yet the mind has no mind.
Externally observe the form—yet the form has no form.
Distant observation of things—yet things have no things.
When these three insights are realized, one perceives only Emptiness.
Emptiness has nothing to empty—when that which is emptied has no existence,
then the nonexistence of nonexistence is nonexistent.
When nonexistence of nonexistence is nonexistent, it remains perpetually tranquil.
Tranquility has nothing to tranquilize—how then could desire arise?
If desire does not arise, that is True Stillness.
True and constant response to things, True and constant attainment of nature—
constant response and constant stillness, constant purity and stillness.
If one can thus abide, then the body attains emptiness,
the emotions return to the Primordial,
and one may interact with things to benefit others,
transcending the mundane to enter sainthood.
This is the True Dao—reverently upheld in practice.

From this path of practice,
one enters from Nonbeing to Being,
employing the Method of the Fusion of Sun and Moon,
nurturing the Holy Embryo to perfection,
so that even in dreams, it differs not from waking—
only then may one practice the Dao of the Piercing Wind of the Celestial Cavern,
attaining a saintly, robust body,
entering and exiting naturally,
and thus may one traverse the celestial realms,
paying homage to the Golden Gate of Emptiness.

**The Nighttime Lying Method**
When lying down, first stretch out hands and feet, reclining on the back.
Then focus on the five viscera, and afterward,
concentrate on the Heavenly Venerable seated within the Yellow Court,
sitting motionless, radiating boundless light,
illuminating the ten directions.
At this moment, forget body and mind,
directing attention inward—
contemplate how my original, primordial spirit was at first birth,
how it was concentrated and still,
how it daily used and ruled my form,
how it was lodged elsewhere,
how it migrated.
Deep reflection brings initial awareness—
the spirit’s clarity is dim,
but soon the mind opens wide,
feeling the four qi settled and tranquil,
the Sun and Moon descending their light,
dually illuminating the Mysterious Palace.
The Heavenly Venerable sits clearly before me,
untainted by the slightest dust,
distinctly hearing the wondrous music of the Celestial Palace.
Again, I see the world’s myriad strange and marvelous sights—
yet I must not cling to thoughts,
lest my spirit scatter.
This is the clarity of one’s original nature,
as the scriptures say: *"Brightly perceiving the Pure and Clear Realm."*

One must daily practice the Method of the Fusion of Sun and Moon,
nurturing the original nature,
valuing the strengthening of the Yang Spirit,
so that one may traverse ten thousand *li* in an instant.
When first observing, one must steady body and mind—
if they are unsettled, it becomes the *Tiantian* Wind.

**The Ritual of Abstinence and Offerings**
When encountering ritual offerings,
such as proclaiming the Five Directions’ Sacred Scriptures,
concentrate on the pure qi of each direction,
emanating from one’s own five viscera,
and fuse them with the five directions.
After completion, the qi of the five viscera merges into one,
settling in the Yellow Court,
where the Heavenly Venerable is made to ascend and enter the throat.
Within the Yellow Court, await the proclamation of the Five Sacred Elders of the Taoist Canon,
summoning the臣’s vital qi from within.
During this passage, concentrate on the three fields’ pure qi:
the upper in the Primordial Unity Palace,
the ranks awaiting the Holy Ones.
Concentrate on the celestial saints seated in the ritual array,
each descending their true qi,
merging with the gods of the Primordial Unity Palace within one’s head,
forming a single body.
The Heavenly Venerable sits upon the Jade Circuit in the Primordial Unity Palace,
receiving the ritual offerings and sacrifices.
When the incense burner is extinguished, return the Heavenly Venerable to the Yellow Court.

**The Method of Subduing Malevolent Spirits**
When encountering malevolent, perverse, or rebellious spirits,
concentrate on the Heavenly Venerable of the Three Palaces,
ascending to the Mud Pillow Palace,
seated upon the Jade Circuit,
summoning the pure qi of the five viscera from within to ascend to Heaven,
merging with the pure qi of the Five Stars,
each transforming into an Emperor—
as if human emperors, each with their directional colors,
standing in their proper positions,
wearing their respective garments,
holding jade tablets.
Further transform the five viscera and five stars
into Five Celestial Generals,
like human military officers,
arrayed in their directional colors,
wearing their proper attire,
holding long spears,
bearing bows and swords,
standing in their positions.
Then concentrate on one’s own divine generals and officials,
ascending before the Five Emperors, Five Generals, and Five Demons,
seizing the aforementioned ghosts and bandits,
bringing them before the Heavenly Venerable,
who judges and binds them,
sending them to the Three Officials’ Bureau for trial.
Recite this incantation:
*"The Divine Lord receives the command,
arriving at the Golden Horse Inn,
ninefold!"*
Then issue the Five Emperors’, Five Generals’, and Five Demons’ talismans
to the sick person for one month’s ingestion.

**Posthumous Offerings**
Using a Heart Petition,
detailed with the name, hometown, birth, and death years of the deceased,
and requesting the Jade Pure Supreme Grand Marshal of the Boundless Void
to oversee and direct the posthumous offerings and alchemical transformation.
Further request the Five Emperors’, Five Generals’, and Five Demons’ talismans
to rectify the deceased’s five viscera,
and summon the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors and the Hidden Language of the Great Brahman
to petition the Ten Directions’ Prisons,
conducting posthumous offerings for the wandering soul.
Additionally, carry the Primordial Origin’s decree,
passing through the Celestial Passes,
the Imperial Edict to the Earthly Deities,
and a Universal Proclamation to the Three Realms,
distributing them to seek the wandering soul.
Draft a memorial, listing the aforementioned decrees,
petitioning for an imperial edict,
and further submitting a memorial to the Jade Pure Supreme Grand Marshal,
requesting the issuance of the Primordial Origin’s decree to the Free and Carefree Upper Pure,
notifying the Year God,
with the date and position specified,
executed by the Jade Pure Supreme Grand Marshal of the Boundless Void.

**Retribution and Response**
For the sick lying in bed at night,
ingest two talismans of the Three-Five Method.

Use the **Three-Five Talisman** thus:
One talisman tied upon the hairpin,
one upon the bed-curtain’s sash,
one placed upon the hearth to burn.

Additionally, with a **sacrificial offering**, report to the Six Departments,
conjuring the **Three-Five Generals** to pursue and subdue the retribution.

Before using this talisman, **first**—
one must follow the **Chao Yuan Method**, silently petitioning the Celestial Sovereign,
seeking the talisman’s decree for retribution.
Then, burn the two talismans from the hairpin and bed-curtain at their purest points.

**Exorcism and Suppression**
For all manner of inauspicious events in human affairs,
use five iron plates, each three *cun* wide and nine *cun* long,
inscribing the **Five Demon Talismans** on the front,
and **"Exorcism and Suppression"** on the reverse.
Below, note the year, month, day, and hour,
and beneath that, half the surname and given name of the practitioner.
First, compose a **heart-chapter** (petition),
detailed and submitted above,
seeking the talisman’s decree before proceeding.

**Completion of the *Lingbao Wuliangdu Ren Shangjing* Great Method, Volume 46**
**Completion of the *Lingbao Wuliangdu Ren Shangjing* Great Method, Volume 47**
**Altar Diagram and Curtain Rites**
**Exterior Lamp Diagram**

**Exorcism and Suppression (Continued)**

**Exterior Lamp Array**
To the right of the exterior altar, light **159 lamps**.
The **Great Age Lamp** follows the year’s alignment.
The **Native Command Lamp** and **Current Command Lamp**,
as well as the **Great and Minor Tomb Lamps**,
are lit according to the host’s birth and current *Lingbao* attributes.

The **Native Command Lamp** and **Current Command Lamp** follow the twelve *Earthly Branches*.
The **Great and Minor Tomb Lamps** are determined by the *Five Clans’ Auspicious Sounds* (纳音).

The **Lamps of the Ten Directions, Nine Officials, Twenty-Eight Constellations, and Five Peaks**,
are lit in their respective directions.

The **Lamps of the Seven Ancestors and Nine Abysses**,
by the original method, are lit in the central courtyard.
If they obstruct the ritual proceedings,
light the **Seven Ancestors Lamp** in the southwest,
and the **Nine Abysses Lamp** at the *Ghost Gate* (鬼门).

**Establishing the Altar Platform**
The **Yellow Register Altar Platform** must be established in accordance with the **Dao of Heaven and the Model of Earth**,
surrounding the celestial constellations,
soaring through the void in empty steps,
turning the *Lingbao* wheel and treading the *Jiji* rhythm,
either exposed beneath the **Three Luminaries** (三光),
or erected between the eaves of a hall,
or within the **Pearl Palace** (珠宫) if already constructed,
or hastily built in a private chamber for the occasion.
It must strictly adhere to the prescribed regulations,
with no deviation in its construction—
thus, all past masters have emphasized this.

Master **Guangcheng** (广成) declared:
*"The fixed rules of the altar platform must not be violated.
When constructing it, one must carefully examine the wood and earth,
and proceed according to the method."*

In current practice, it is common to establish an **open platform** (露坛),
yet few realize that **sincerity’s resonance reaches the Nine Heavens**,
and **unfocused intent makes even a single step distant**.
If the **ritual robe is stirred by the True Sage** (真圣),
and one’s **focused meditation aligns with the Divine** (神明),
how can mere walls contain it?

After sealing the altar,
one must not **reverse the ritual steps within the platform**,
nor **enter and exit in disorderly fashion**,
lest the **proper decorum and sequence be violated**.
If there appears **hasty, chaotic movement**,
the ritual posture will be disrupted,
and **sincerity and reverence will be lost**—
thus, the Confucian scholar does not perform sacrifices in disarrayed attire.
This is why one must **reflect upon it**,
before extending the **ritual offering** (斋荐).

**Platform Dimensions and Lamps**
The **outermost tier** of the platform is **36 *chi* wide and 3 *chi* 6 *cun* high**.
Another method prescribes a **50 *chi* wide central tier**,
with an **inner tier of 24 *chi* width and 2 *chi* 4 *cun* height**.
Another method dictates a **36 *chi* wide middle tier**,
with a **12 *chi* wide inner tier and 3 *chi* height**.
Yet another method states that a **18 *chi* wide platform**,
should be fortified with **precious *Bo* tiles** (宝博),
and paved with **cultured jasper** (文石).
If only temporary wooden structures are available,
or if the earthen platform is hastily built,
it must still conform to the prescribed standards,
to uphold the **morning court’s ceremonial rites** (朝奏之礼).

Some light the lamps beneath the **Void and Clarity** (空明),
to manifest **sincere intent**.
Others erect the **Heavenly Treasure Platform** (天宝台),
taking the method from the **Upper Realm** (上境).
When conducting the ritual and following the **Dao/Way**,
these are the primary considerations.

In the center, place the **three sacred images of the Highest Sovereign** (太上三尊),
as in the **morning assembly of the Mysterious Capital, Jade Canopy** (玄都玉京).

The platform has **four layers**,
with **barriers for the Heavenly Gate, Earthly Gate, Flying Bridge**, etc.,
all meticulously crafted,
resembling the **auspicious lotus** (瑞莲) in form.
The number of layers may be **81, 72, 64, or 49**,
depending on the platform’s width and breadth.

Some arrange **precious *Bo* tiles as pavers**,
with an **outer width of 8 *chi***.

The **barriers** are erected with care,
each bound with **green-black cords** (青绛绳),
so that none may topple.

Only the **east, south, west, and north gates** remain open;
all others are barred.
The **barriers of the three tiers** are also set according to their numbers.

**Red for long barriers, black for short barriers**,
lamps are installed on the **central gate** and **twelve gates**—
these are not included in the aforementioned count.

The **arranged lamp positions** are marked roughly by the **Great Frame** (大槩),
and their quantity is determined by one’s capacity.
Some follow the **simplified lamp rituals** as recorded in *Lingbao Wuliangdu Ren Shangjing*,
which can also **illuminate the Ten Directions**,
**extend the luminous continuity and dispel darkness**,
**communicate with the Nine Abysses and Hell**,
and **shine upon the Infinite Blessing Hall** (无极福堂).
This is the **supreme method** for merit and virtue.

Some combine **various fragrant oils**,
or mix them with **sandalwood paste** (兰膏).
**Lingzhu candles** (鸾烛) in thousands,
**Yanlamps** (鸳灯) in ten thousand flames,
**piled blossoms and layered petals** (攒花迭萼),
**phoenix feathers and whale scales** (凤羽鲸鳞),
radiating **strange and brilliant forms** (照灼奇姿),
**shimmering with varied splendor** (荧煌异状).

Some place the **Moon’s image at the side**,
imitating the **spirit of the Frost Rabbit** (霜兔).
Others depict **distant solar rays** (远写日芒),
and model the **wings of the Weaver Bird** (梭乌).

Some arrange the **constellation of the Southern Dipper** (南箕),
others transmit the **shape of the Northern Dipper** (北斗),
some inscribe **sealed script** (篆文),
others render **true images** (真像).
Though the **colors and forms may appear scattered and chaotic**,
if the **ritual sequence is correctly observed**,
one will naturally **attain blessings**.

Aspiring ritualists may **follow this as a model**.

**Platform Barriers and Inscribed Text**
The **outermost platform** has **eight inscribed banners** (门榜).

**The Sacred Positions of the Azure Flower Hall (青华堂圣位):**
Within the **Eastern Polarity Palace (东极宫)**, the **Great Compassionate and Benevolent One (中大慈仁者)**—

Each day, after burning incense, **chant the Azure Flower Rescue-from-Suffering Hymn (青华救苦颂)**.
At the **three ritual periods**, perform the **Dao** and **pay homage** accordingly."*

At the commencement of the **fasting ritual (启斋)**, one should first present the **Supreme Petition for Heavenly Rescue (通天救苦表)**,
To inform the **Celestial Venerable of Opening (启天尊)**, whose **virtue/power (德)** of compassion and mercy responds to voices and attends to sensations,
And swiftly manifests at the **Mysterious Altar (玄坛)**, bestowing the heart of instruction and liberation.

**The Azure Flower Rescue-from-Suffering Hymn (青华救苦颂) in Three Verses**

**Morning Ritual (早朝):**
The Celestial Venerable vows a **Great Compassionate Heart (大悲心)**,
Rescuing all beings from suffering and transforming **karmic causes (善因)**.
The **Five Sacred Mountains (五岳)** and **Four Celestial Departments (四司)** all receive commands,

With **true talismans (真符)** and petitions sent below, all are granted pardon,
And **child-officials (童子)** proclaim the liberation of the guilty.
The **Primordial Beginning (元始)** manifests in **true wondrous form (妙相)**,
And the **liberation of beings (度人)** becomes boundless through the **Dao/Way (道)**.

**Midday Ritual (午朝):**
The Celestial Venerable swears to liberate all sentient beings,
And delivers **Dharma (法)** in solemn splendor, seated within the **precious grove (宝林)**.
The **Nine-Headed Lion (狮子九头)** reveals its auspicious form,
And the **radiant wisdom-light (慧光)** illuminates, dispelling all darkness.
The **mountains of knives (剑树)** and **flaming peaks (刀山)** are crushed and broken,
While **fire veils (火翳)** and **wind-thunder (风雷)** cease and desist.
With **boundless great compassion (无量大悲)**, liberation arrives,
And all **Underworld officials (酆都地狱)** and **dark realms (幽阴)** hear and respond.

**Evening Ritual (晚朝):**
The Celestial Venerable’s **wisdom-force (慧力)** rescues those with **embodied spirits (含灵)**,
Seeking voices to break the **iron city (铁城)** of suffering.
The **vast salvation (弘济)** follows one’s wishes, extending boundlessly,
And **universal radiance (光明)** illuminates, reaching even the deepest prisons.
Where the **wisdom-wind (慧风)** blows, scorching smoke vanishes;
Where the **Dharma-rain (法雨)** falls, decayed fortunes revive.
With **boundless compassion and mercy (无量慈悲)**, all are liberated,
And **wandering souls (亡魂)** alike behold the **Venerable of Compassion (慈尊)**.

The **Nine Celestial Inspectors (九天采访使)** and **True Lord of Preserving the Primordial (应元保运真君)**.

The **Imperial Sage (皇人)** declares:
*"At the outset of establishing the fasting ritual (建斋之始), one must present the **Supreme Petition for the Mysterious (启玄表文)**,
Ascend the altar to **supplement one’s rank (补职)** and fulfill the **ritual homage (朝礼)**.
To **examine and rectify (纠察)** all transgressions and offenses,
And face the **Master Lords (师君)**, atoning for their sins and crimes,
So as to avoid punishment by the **Underworld authorities (冥司)**.
When the fast is concluded (散斋之时), one must present the **Supreme Petition of Gratitude (谢玄表文)**,
Along with the **supplementation of rank (补职状)** and the **scripture count (经数目名字)**,
And perform the **ritual of atonement to the Three Officials (三官谢罪礼)**.
Upon completion of the **petitions and offerings (文状)**, one must again return thanks to the **Five Masters (五师)** for their blessings."*

**The Petition to the Three Masters (请三师仪):**

**The Scripture Master (经师):**
With **golden tablets (金简)** and **sacred texts (灵篇)**,
And **precious scrolls (琅函宝诰)** that have flowed to the **unworthy disciples (末学)**,
One should **revere and honor (尊仰)** the **true Master (真师)**.
Using **green silk and golden buttons (青丝金钮)** to swear one’s earnest devotion,
And **flower-embroidered satchels (采蕊笈)** and **cloud-patterned bags (云囊)** to seek the **profound truths (奥旨)**.
When performing the **fast and worship (修斋祀)**, one must first **offer to the Scripture Master (奉经师)**,
Gazing upward to the **True Compassion (真慈)**,
And bowing to the **Dharma seat (法席)**.
We, your humble servants, tremble with **awe and reverence (恐悚)**,
And are **burned and purified (战灼)** in this sacred endeavor.

**The Register Master (籍师):**
With **golden tablets (金籍)** and **soft jade pages (柔玉成篇)**,
The **Secret Books of the Supreme Sage (上圣之秘书)** record all **hidden truths of the departed (夭之隐讳)**.
Accumulating **meritorious deeds (功)** and **virtue/power (德)**,
Even the **lightest good (纤芥)** is not overlooked.
Ascending in rank to **true perfection (真)**, one progresses through **countless kalpas (劫年)** without decline.
Thus, when performing the **fast of rectification (修斋直)**, one must **offer to the Register Master (奉籍师)**,
Gazing upward to the **True Compassion (真慈)**,
And bowing to the **Dharma seat (法席)**.
We, your humble servants, tremble with **dread and humility (局踏)**,
And are **bowed in reverence (俯望)** to the utmost.

**The Liberation Master (度师):**
With **scriptures and talismans (经箓)** in hand, we truly **revere the Patriarch (祖师)**,
And **transcend the mundane to attain the true (拔俗超真)** is through the **Teaching Father (教父)**.
How could **later disciples (后学)** dare to forget **establishing goodness (立善)**,
Or be **lost in confusion (迷涂)** while yet attaining the **profound intent (旨归)**?
Both **hidden and manifest beings (幽显)** follow in accord,
And the **principle (道)** unites past and present.
Moreover, **Chen Sheng and Fan Zeng (陈胜范)**—
When performing the **fast of liberation (奉度师)**, one must **offer to the Liberation Master (奉度师)**,
Gazing upward to the **True Compassion (真慈)**,
And bowing to the **Dharma seat (法席)**.
We, your humble servants, tremble with **fear and solemnity (兢栗)**,
And are **filled with pleading (哀祈)** to the utmost.

**The Ritual of Ascending the Platform and Reciting the Invocation Chapters (登坛演祝品), the Ritual of Ascending the Platform and Reciting the Dao Chapters (登坛演法章).**

This incense offering—rooted in the boundless void (杳冥), its essence the empty expanse (虚空)—
Unshaken by the eight winds, unstoppable by ten thousand men.
Today, plucked with hand and offered to the sacred platform (法坛),
Devoted first to the Supreme Emperor of the Invocation (上祝皇帝).
May I humbly pray that in the post-Heavenly era, You remain ageless as the rising sun,
Ever the sovereign of the Great Dao, eternally the benevolent ruler of the land.

This incense offering—devoted to the ministers of the current age (当朝宰辅),
And all noble officials (百执公卿) of my Dao and my realm.
May I humbly pray that with one virtue (一德) You ascend to heaven’s firmament and endure eternally,
And with six tortoises (六鳌) bear the earth to balance its governance.
May those adorned with jade and wielding gold all rise to the highest paths,
Climbing dragons and consorting with phoenixes, ascending to the celestial realm.

This incense offering—devoted to all virtuous scholars and faithful in this assembly (在会一切贤士信人).
May I humbly pray that the Dao’s nature is profound and clear,
And all beings instantly awaken from their afflictions.
Though guilt be mountains high, may they forever break free from limitless entanglements,
And each soul’s essence be refined as jade, their names inscribed in golden script.

For the departed ancestors of my lineage, may they all attain auspicious rebirth,
And all sentient beings transcend the bounds of the dharma-realm (法界).
Next, I recite the **White Text of the Supreme Seat (升座白文)**—
*"Natural Primordial Beginning (自然元始),*
*Whose numinous wind stirs the void’s resonance (灵风鼓空洞之章).*
**The *Scripture of the Limitless Dao of the Soul’s Jewel* (无量度人) refines the vital qi of the Yang of the Five Phases (丹阳之炁).*
**The *Three Luminaries of Clarity* (开明三景) nurture all divine spirits (普殖神灵).*
With the **Five Elements of Transformation (混化之五文)** and the **Nine Revolutions of Divine Mechanism (妙神机之九转),**
They enter and emerge, bearing yin while embracing yang,
Existing or vanishing—deep-rooted, firm as the stem.
When struck in true stillness, they respond; when sensed in profound emptiness, they open.
Yet how much more so: the self-born cling to earth and sink their souls,
While those who attain the One are light and pure, their spirits floating with ease.

Thus, among the thirty-six divisions of esoteric teachings,
Only the **Soul’s True Essence (灵本真)** is unique.
Granting the **Thousand Two Hundred Official Titles (锡千二百之官章)** to rescue the wandering,
Even bones abandoned in the wild, when touched by the **Soul’s Immortal Talisman (长生灵符)**, emit smoke and revive.
The **Purple Qi** passes the mountain gates,
And when the **Marvelous Dao’s True Scripture (妙法真经)** is recited, the caldron’s boiling ceases.

In all directions, teachings flourish; in myriad forms, beings are born.
If called "Great," then the six extremes are not distant.
If named "Dao," then all beings receive their portion.
Without the **Supreme Primordial (太元)**, no single law could stand;
To those who hold sentience, all wonders are ineffable.

I bestow the **Three Ordinances of the Emperor (三箓之简文)**,
And mark the **Nine Platforms of the Scholar and Commoner (九坛之科式)**.
Both the living and the dead receive blessings,
And all ages follow in reverence.
Yet alas, the paths of yin and yang are divided,
And the principles of life and death are obscure.
In vain do we yearn with broken hearts,
Unknowing where to seek the ultimate.

Only the **Supreme Dao’s Descent of the Soul-Returning Ordinance (太上降返魂之箓)**,
And the **Mysterious Capital’s Rite for Crossing Death (玄都出度死之仪)**,
Can be solemnly invoked—
Their sacred efficacy alone is trustworthy.

Thus, I purify my heart and uphold the precepts,
Repel evil while preserving sincerity,
Using black hair instead of shaved scalp marks (割发之纹),
And gold treasures to pledge my solemn vows (质盟之信).
With humble words and earnest supplication,
I bow my hands and pray to heaven,
Having bathed in humility and diligence,
Unable to suppress my devotion.

Though I have hidden my body in the forests and mountains,
And set my resolve among the mists and clouds,
Studying esoteric ordinances in the **Mysterious Platform (玄坛)**,
I am ever ashamed of my failure to ascend as a **Flying God (飞神)** in the **Lofty Hall (寥殿)**.

Now, with this encouragement,
I strive to cleanse myself.

My mind is void—then the heart resonates with the **Great Emptiness (太虚)**;
My resolve and wisdom are steadfast—then the light of wisdom is unobstructed.
I exalt the **Mysterious Standard (玄范)** and chant the **Empty Hymns (空歌)**,
Their **Lingering Dragon’s Sound (琳琅之音)** echoing through the ten directions,
And the **Vital Qi of the Dao’s Conduct (梵行之炁)** filling the eight extremes.

The **Golden Dragon** leaps in flight,
The **Divine Tiger** races with swiftness.
When the **Jade Edicts (玉札)** are issued, even the loftiest peaks and valleys bow in reverence;
When the **Sacred Decrees (符命)** are proclaimed, the **Yin Abyss (酆幽)** obeys and follows.

I cast fire ten thousand li,
And revolve within the **Great Furnace of the Alchemist (大冶之炉)**.
I let the **Eight Bell Incense (流铃)** descend,
And shatter the **Cold Hills’ Chisel (寒丘之锷)**.

Thus, I draw in the essence of the sun and moon,
And illuminate the night’s platform.
I gather the **Rectified Qi of Heaven and Earth (天地之正炁)**,
And rescue this numinous consciousness (灵识).
Above, I rely on the **Dao of the Heavenly Venerable (天尊之道)**,
Below, I praise the **Humble Ministers of the Dao (樵木之臣)**.

With the assembly united in heart,
I open the **Numinous Feast (灵席)**.

**Opening the Platform and Invoking the Sacred Chapters (开坛启请词章):**
A disciple of the **Yellow Ordinance Great Fast (黄箓大斋)**, [name] certain,
Prostrates twice with reverence,
And now reveals my sincere devotion,
To implore the celestial audience.

I reflect that we dwell in the dust of mundane affairs,
And labor long in the realm of secular splendor,
Lost in the vast sea of suffering,
And mired in the endless cycle of karmic dust.

Fortunate indeed, by past merit we have some virtue,
And aspire to the **Pure Void (清虚)**.
Though deaf and blind to worldly ways,
Our hearts revere the **Supreme Dao (至道)**.
We seek to ascend gradually to its mysteries,
And rescue all beings from the fate of existence and annihilation.

We intend to renew ourselves,
And wash away the sins of our past days.

From today onward, within the九州 and all lands,
Loyal ministers and righteous scholars
Have perished for their devotion to the state,
While filial sons and obedient grandsons
Have lost their lives in safeguarding their families.
Some wander in foreign lands,
Frozen and starving, their spirits consumed.
Others lie exposed in distant villages,
And die from want before their time.
Some are seized by cruel tyrants,
And killed to repay old debts.
Others fall in war’s calamities,
And suffer disaster for past karmic causes.

The **Chaste Widows of Unyielding Virtue (抱贞坚之烈妇)**,
And the **Men of Pure Devotion (怀赤心之正人)**,
Though they offend no one, are slain by sudden rage,
Cut down by the edge of blades.
Or infants, weak in vital qi,
And the aged, frail and infirm,
Who die from improper habits or poor nourishment,
And are left to drift along the roads,
Or to perish in the wilderness.

Some abandon themselves in despair,
Leaping into rivers or flames,
Drowned in the waves or crushed by winds,
Or perish in storms while sheltering in homes.
Others, by mistake, drink poison and drown in the depths,
Or are devoured by ferocious beasts in the wild.
Their bodies fall in perilous places,
And their lives are taken by the law.

Even more, those afflicted by **Wind Labor (风劳)** and **Cold Qi (气泠)**,
Whose lifespans are exhausted and end,
Face endless suffering in sorrow,
And mourn the distant path home.
In the boundless darkness of the underworld,
They lament the years until rebirth.

If they do not depend on the **Dao’s Power (道力)**,
How could such souls ever ascend?

I have heard of the **Yellow Ordinance Great Fast (黄箓大斋)**,
Whose merits and virtues are beyond measure.
The **Deep Mystery Fast (洞玄醮法)** possesses vast divine power,
Capable of rescuing all beings from the **Endless Ocean of Suffering (无边沉泉之苦)**,
And saving countless souls from the **Five Ages of Karmic Retribution (亿万期劫之魂)**.

The **Golden Ordinance (金箓)** pardons past transgressions,
And the **White Tablet (白简)** grants the **Liberation of Effortless Bliss (逍遥快乐)**.
To attend this fast three times,
Is to avoid the five torments—
How much more so if one devotes oneself entirely to its construction!

The humble disciple hears that the venerable Master, widely spreading the **Teachings and Laws (教法)**, magnificently elucidating the true **Dao/Way (真风)**, expounding the **Pure Stillness of Non-Action (清静於无为)**, and rescuing the living and the dead from the **Lower Earth (下土)**, has achieved his **virtue/power (功)** and fulfilled his **practice (行)**, all revered by the multitude. His **virtue/power (德)** is noble, his **Dao/Way (道)** esteemed, and all pay homage.

The disciple prays for the Master’s boundless compassion and pity, humbly hoping he may deign to grant approval and temporarily bestow the **Celestial Dao (仙斿)**, descending to preside over this **fast/ritual assembly (斋会)**, guiding the essential principles and uplifting the sacred rites. As the **Grand Overseer of the Altar (总宰坛场)**, he may broadly expound the **盟真**’s sacred precepts, so that his **virtue/power (功)** may benefit both the **living and the departed (幽显)**, and his blessings extend to all. This is beyond the disciple’s ability—all stems from the Master’s **Dao’s Transformation (道化)**. The disciple bows twice in reverence.

The Master replies:
*"The disciple is a humble, lowly being, a mere scholar beneath the thatched roof. Though he has received the **Dao/Way (法)** from an enlightened teacher, alas, his own self remains unrefined.*

*The humble disciple hears that within lies a marvel beyond, and within lies a truth that naturally manifests without. Yet, as an unlearned mortal, he is still entangled in worldly affairs, lacking the primal **Dao’s Power (真妙之元)**. How could he possibly propagate the **Supreme Dao/Way (至道)** outwardly?

*He wished to dwell in secluded mountain caves, abandon wisdom, and conceal his light, practicing **breathing techniques (吐纳)** to cultivate the **Three Morning Elixir (三晨之华)**, refining the **Nine True Essences (九真之液)** to nourish the **Embryonic Immortal (胎仙)**, perfecting both form and spirit. Only then could he aid others and rescue the living, expound the **Dao’s Transformation (阐化)** and propagate its teachings. Yet, he has been granted this sincere request—how could he dare refuse? Though unworthy of this task, he humbly petitions the Master for guidance.*

*The disciple further entreats: With utmost sincerity, we again offer our earnest supplications, hoping the Master’s wisdom may illuminate our path. The humble disciple hears that the **Orthodox Celestial Master (正一天师)** received the **Elixir Scripture (丹书)** from Mount Jing, yet hesitated to refine it, fearing it would be of no benefit in the mortal realm and bringing shame to the **Three Realms (三境)** at the heavenly gates. The **Wondrous Rescue True Lord (妙济真君)** obtained the **Jade Ordinance (玉箓)** from the Western Chu, immediately aiding beings and drawing his home to ascend through divine grace.

*This is the saying: first cultivate outward **virtue/power (外德)**, then refine inner **Dao’s Power (内功)**. The outer and inner support each other, with sincere devotion spanning the days. Pointing toward the **Caverns of Immortality (洞天)**, he embarks on celestial wanderings, and his **Dao’s Transformation (惠外修)** grants blessings to the unrefined. At the **Immortal’s Gate (仙阙)**, he summons the winds and clouds with his **Dao’s Power (道化)**. Since ancient times, the **Highest Immortals (高真)** have followed this path.

*The disciple prays that the Master may emulate the **Dao’s Transformation (灵迹)** of ancient Immortals, establishing a **Law for Aiding the World (济世之律梁)**, continuing the **Immortal’s Legacy (古仙之遗业)**, and refining the **Ladder of Rescue (拯度之梯航)**. He humbly hopes the Master may open the **Gate of Convenience (方便之门)**, eternally providing the **Path for the Living and the Dead (存亡之路)**. Countless suffering souls shall achieve rebirth, and beings in heaven and earth alike shall cherish the Master’s compassionate blessings.

*Moreover, the **fast/ritual altar (法坛)** is already prepared, and the moment of opening is at hand. We earnestly beg the Master to descend in compassion, granting us this **Gate of Convenience (方便)**. The living and the dead shall receive the **Enlightenment of Great Peace (开泰之恩)**, and all beings, from birth to death, shall benefit from the Master’s **Dao’s Transformation (提携之化)**. We are overwhelmed by this boundless mercy.*

*The Master again grants the request: Though the disciple has made three humble petitions, his sincerity is acknowledged. You have resolved not to evade this duty. Fearful of disrupting the **perfect fulfillment (圆成)**, I shall reluctantly comply, devoting myself wholeheartedly to your wishes. All shall receive extraordinary blessings.

*Through this **opening of the altar’s merit (开坛功德)**, the **Seven Celestial Temples (七庙)** shall be honored above. Wandering the **Great Void (太漠)**, I shall refine my **Dao’s Power (真)** in the **Celestial Pure Realm (碧落之天)**. Following the **Jade Emperor (玉皇)**, I shall nurture my **Dao’s Transformation (素)** in the **Luminous Mist Domain (明霞之境)**. Next, I shall purify the **Nine Earths (九土)**, dispelling the **mists and dust (氛尘)** and silencing the **Four Directions’ smoke and fire (四夷烟燧)**. In times of wind and rain, there shall be nourishment; during autumn harvests, no sickness shall arise. Locusts and plagues shall be annihilated, and all departed souls shall ascend to the **Dao’s Realm (道境)**. The **Four Existences and Six Paths (四生六道)** shall all attain **wondrous bliss (妙乐)**.

*Now that the **sacred rites (威仪)** are prepared and the time of opening has arrived, let us not further decline in humility but instead hold this matter in highest regard.*

*The disciple thanks the Master: We have been graciously granted the Master’s approval, and our gratitude knows no bounds. With deepest reverence, we bow twice and invite the Master to ascend the altar.*

**Ascending the Altar and Opening the Fast:**
*"He who gives birth to heaven and earth, governs the sun and moon, and nurtures all beings—this is the **Dao’s Function (道之用)**. He who imparts teachings and sets precepts, transmits **Dao’s Power (戒)** and grants **sacred talismans (符)**, rescues the living and guides the dead—this is the **Dao’s Compassion (道之慈)**. The **Yellow Ordinance and White Tablet (黄箓白简)**, descending to rescue the **Netherworld’s Path (冥途)**, universally aiding the departed—this is the **Jade Pure Celestial’s Special Pardon (玉清之曲赦)**. The **Dao’s Function (明道之用)** and the **Dao’s Compassion (运道之慈)**, along with the invocation of the **Jade Pure Celestial’s Special Pardon (玉清之曲赦)**—this is the **Dao’s Path (道)**.

*It depends on humanity’s devotion; if sincere, it moves heaven and earth, and touches the spirits and deities, both near and far, deep and hidden. It responds as if echoing across valleys. It depends on sincerity—if not the right person, even sincerity may fail to reach its mark.*

*Now, the humble disciple obeys the Master’s command, establishing this **fast/ritual platform (法席)**. With utmost reverence, he invokes the **Dao’s Power (真灵)**, transcending and guiding the departed souls to ascend to **Immortal Rank (仙品)**."*

「Now, I humbly follow the ritual teachings, meticulously arranging the solemn rites. With the **vermilion seal (朱章)** I summon the spirits, with the **fragrant elixir (兰汤)** I purify the defilements, with the **brilliant lanterns (华灯)** I illuminate the path, with the **precious banners (宝旛)** I guide the deities. I employ the **sacred talismans (灵符)** to descend into the **Nine Abysses (九幽)**, and offer **devotional provisions (供养)** to benefit the **Six Realms (六道)**.

First, I take refuge in the **Three Treasures (三宝)**, then I proclaim the **precepts (戒)** to the **Nine True Ones (九真)**, retrieve the **wandering souls (幽魄)** from the **Southern Hall (南宫)**, and erase the **darkened names (黑名)** from the **Northern Bureau (北府)**. I administer the **Great Daoist Elixir (大法药)** to rescue those lost in sin, hold the **Great Daoist Lamp (大法炬)** to dispel the darkness of the abyss, and spread the **Great Daoist Cloud (大法云)** to cover all beings. Such are the **merits and virtues (功德)**, beyond all measure.

If one like me has mistakenly taken on the knowledge of another, and now serves the **Jade Platform (瑶坛)**, how dare I not be vigilant in my heart, seeking mercy from the **Supreme Sage (太上)**.

I hope that the **Highest Truths (高真)** will descend in compassion, that the departed may ascend in spirit, that their **transformed countenances (易容颜)** may be refined in the **Nine Refineries (九炼之庭)**, and that their **extinguished grudges (消冤)** may be answered in the **Three Officials’ Bureau (三官之府)**. Relying entirely on the **Dao’s Compassionate Will (慈悲之愿)**, I pray they may all journey together to the **Land of Dao and Virtue (道德之乡)**.

Furthermore, I hope that those of the same platform may expound and extol the **teachings of the Dao (教典)**.

With this **offering of incense (一瓣香)**, I pay homage to the **Sacred Scriptures (法语)**. May it ascend to the **Three Realms (三境)**, descend to the **Nine Abysses (九幽)**, traverse the boundless **kalpas (浩劫)** and always reach its mark, ride the **Wheel of Retribution (圆轮)** and forever respond.

I now burn this incense in the **offering furnace (向炉)**, dedicating it to the departed soul of **Master So-and-so (亡过某人)**.

I humbly pray that their **imperfections and burdens (瑕累)** may be absolved, that they may **severely transcend earthly attachments (迥脱尘根)**, and swiftly ascend from the **Realm of Impermanence (有漏之乡)** to reach the **Shore of Non-Action (无为之岸)**. May their **true essence (真源)** rest in **profound stillness (湛寂)**, and no **law (法)** remain.

**Deluded thoughts (妄念)** scatter and **ten thousand entanglements (万缘)** arise. To **awaken to them (悟之)** is to transcend the **Great Transformation (大化)**, to be **unaware of them (昧之)** is to sink into the **Path of Delusion (迷途)**.

Moreover, this **floating and restless concern (浮爽之忧)** has not yet grasped the **essence of rebirth (返胎之旨)**.

Thus, the **Great Dao (大道)** pities the suffering of all beings, and **pledges the Sacred Talismans (盟真垂济度之章)**. A single thought of ascension is **hiddenly connected (潜通)** to the **spirit insects (肸蠁)**. The **clustered heavens (丛霄)** are vast and boundless, yet not even a **hair’s breadth (纤毫)** separates them.

I bow in gratitude for the **curved and encompassing grace (曲照之恩)** and feel indebted to the **favor of spirit guidance (迁神之惠)**.

I, **Certain Disciple (某式)**, follow the **plain talismans (素简)**, and am entrusted to the **mysterious officials (玄司)**. Having already received the **command to list the grievances (诉列之诃)**, I dare not neglect the **task of copying and presenting (誊陈之事)**.

Now, with the **hundred spirit officials (百灵司)** present and the **four qi (四炁)** clarified, I solemnly arrange the **rites (威仪)** and conduct the **scriptural rituals (章御)**. Though my **curtain of understanding (帷)** is but newly raised, how can it match the **prayers of the faithful (请祈)**? I still hope to join the **same stream (同流)** and together **manifest the wondrous responses (共彰妙感)**.

**Talisman of Refining and Ascending, Scripture of Proclaiming Precepts, Request for Answer (炼度说戒升座请答章)**

The **Daoist (道士)** pays three obeisances and kneels to speak:

We disciples have heard that the **Great Dao (大道)** expounds the **teachings of Compassion (慈悲之教)**, and all beings benefit from the **mercy of salvation (济度之恩)**.

Following the **Golden Rituals (金科)**, we solemnly present this **pure and solemn fast (浄醮)**. Now, the **True Immortals (真仙)** have descended to witness, and the **talismans and records (符录)** may be displayed.

The **blessings extend to the Three Paths (三途)**, and the **merits surpass the Nine Nights (九夜)**. We pray for the **bestowal of liberation (开度)** and the **rescue from your sinking (拔尔沉沦)**.

The **answer comes (答云)**: *"Jade Ancients (玉古)."*

The **Golden Precepts** reveal the **treasured talismans and sacred symbols (宝箓灵符)**.
The **Nine Nights and Three Paths** rely upon the **refinement of the soul and tempering of the spirit (度魂炼魄)**.

It should be entrusted to the **worthy adept (上士)**, not transmitted to the unworthy.
Yet, this humble servant—how dare I alone bear such a great request?

Again kneeling, I say:
The **Three Realms (三界)** descend in witness, my heart utterly sincere.
If the **talismans and talismanic rites (符箓)** are displayed upon the seat,
then the **sacred rites (灵仪)** truly rely upon this to ascend to Heaven.

I humbly decline with modesty—
how could I presume to pray so boldly?
Yet, I align with Heaven’s will and follow the hearts of all.

May you **pity the sinking souls of the Nine Nights (九夜之沉魂)**—
this is truly the **Daoist master’s compassion (道师之慈惠)**.
Since sincerity is certain to reach its mark,
I await the swift arrival of the **auspicious banner and flag (幢节)**.

**Answer:** *"We have heard that you act on Heaven’s behalf, benefiting beings and aiding humanity. This is because the Daoist’s worth is exalted and enlightened, fulfilling the hopes of all. Yet, our capacities are shallow and insufficient—how can we fulfill such requests?"*

Again kneeling, I say:
I have repeatedly submitted petitions to the Three Realms,
and the **feasts and seats (斋心)** have already been spread in the four directions.
With a heart as fervent as the heavens, I endure suffering and sorrow, awaiting your decree.

I humbly beseech the **Great Master of High Merit (高功大法师)**—
may your words flow like a spring, your virtue embrace the boundless.
Hasten the **auspicious flags (羽旆)** to descend broadly,
and proclaim the **sacred texts (灵文)** to bring wide salvation.

For the **Three Paths and Five Torments (三途五苦)**, may you grant the **mercy of rescue (拯拔之仁)**.
For the **stagnant spirits and lost souls (滞魄幽魂)**, may they truly rely upon the **blessings of ascension (超升之泽)**.

I am utterly devoted in my earnest prayers.

**Answer:**

The **Great Master** replies:

*"The **auspicious flags (羽旆)** have been summoned again and again with utmost sincerity and trust.
Since the **true and sacred (真灵)** has condescended to descend, how dare I, a humble and ignorant one, fail to report it?

By **virtue (义)**, I cannot refuse—
by **rites (礼)**, I must present it fully.
The **talismans and spells (符箓)** are solemnly prepared and placed upon the **jewel-axe (宝轴)**,
while the **souls and spirits (灵魂)** are refined and ascended at the **Crimson Peak (朱陵)**.

May the **Great Assembly (大众)** proceed first,
and I shall follow in their wake.

Now, I beseech the **True Master (真师)** to chant:

*'The Dragon Han [era] begins with the **auspicious laws (盟律)**,
through countless **aeons (劫劫)**, liberating **heavenly beings and humans (天人)**.
The **Sacred Treasure (灵宝)** opens its boundless enclosure,
ferrying across the **wheel of birth and death (生死轮)**.

This is the **Dao of Compassion and Mercy (慈悲道)**,
capable of reviving the withered and bringing honor to the decayed.
None but my **worldly teacher (世师)** could truly grasp the depths of the **dark and obscure (幽冥)**.
The **Sacred Treasure Scriptures (灵宝无量度人上经)** conclude in the **Great Law Volume (大法卷)**—the forty-eighth and forty-ninth.

**The Chapter of Descending and Summoning Talismans and Commands (降召符命品)**.

The **Imperial Sage (皇人)** declares:
*'There are wondrous courts (妙庭) of great splendor,
with golden gates and jade halls—
all formed by the **qi (炁)** of **Primordial Origin (元始)** and the **Sacred Treasure (灵宝)**,
natural patterns that govern the divisions of the ten thousand heavens.

For those who practice **Daoist discipline (行持)**—
if they establish the **Sacred Treasure Altar (灵宝坛)**,
they must inscribe the **True Summoning (真召)** and **Sacred Summoning (灵)** talismans,
to transform the altar grounds into the **golden gates (金阙)** and the **boundaries of the Daoist conduct (梵行之界)**,
then the rites may begin.

**The Talisman of the Highest Clarity’s Sacred Treasure Descending the True (上清灵宝降真符)**
**The Talisman of the Highest Clarity’s Sacred Treasure Summoning the Spirits (上清灵宝召灵符)**

Within these two talismans,
there are twelve **spirit officials (符吏)** overseeing the altar.
When inscribing, use the **Jade Purity Decisions (玉清诀)**,
and with the **three qi of the Heavenly Gate (天门三炁)**, blow the seals to complete them.

The **Mysterious Master (玄师)** says:
*'The **Primordial Sovereign’s (元皇)** talisman of the True and Sacred (降真灵符)**,
and the **Void Sovereign’s (虚皇)** talisman of Summoning the Spirits (召灵灵符)**,
are the natural chapters of the **three heavens’ mysterious and correct qi (三天玄正气)**,
to summon the **three primal assemblies of the Daoist spirits (三元众真)** and the **ten thousand spirits (万灵)**.

**The Talisman of the Highest Clarity’s Sacred Treasure Summoning the Heavenly Spirits (灵宝召天真符)**.

Those **heavenly spirits (天真)** who respond to the summons
must rely upon the **Primordial Sovereign’s (太上元始) Jade Edict (玉敕)**,
dissolving their forms as recorded above.

**The Heavenly Spirits’ Sacred Positions (天真圣位)**.

For those who lack **earnest faith (笃信)** in their studies,
the **Five Sacred Mountains (五岳)** will test them.
If they **leak the secrets lightly (轻露泄密)**,
the summoned spirits will not manifest.

All **Daoist spirits, heavenly beings, and sacred souls (三天仙真灵神)**,
must follow the talisman and appear before you.
Without **sacred texts (神文)**, this is a **false summoning (妄召)**.
Though one may **reflect deeply and strive diligently (精思苦彻)**,
a single misstep may be answered by a thousand trials.
Some who descend may **subject the recipient to demonic tests (魔试)**.

Those who receive the talismans
must follow the **Mysterious Capital’s (玄都) prescribed methods (赍格)**—
weave **three plain silk fabrics (三素缯)**,
according to the year’s measure (随年尺),
and bring them to the **teacher of the scriptures (有经之师)** to be inscribed.
Sit and **meditate upon them with the mind (心记)**,
but do not **write them down (载於文)**,
lest **ghosts, spirits, birds, or beasts (鬼神禽畜)** observe and **leak the secrets (切视漏泄)**.*'

**Summoning Talisman for the Ten-Directional Flying Heavenly Kings**
*(召十方飞天神王符)*

The Master says:
*"The Ten-Directional Flying Heavenly Kings possess supreme **virtue and power** (威德),
their **achievements and strength** (功力) are profound,
and their sacred transformations are beyond comprehension.
At the dawn of the **Red Brightness Eon** (赤明劫),

Each has **ten-directional flying attendants, officials, and soldiers** (十方飞天使者吏兵),

The Master says:
*"The methods of invocation and service are governed by **secret edicts** (密旨).
**Guard against reckless disclosure** (慎无妄泄),
for transgression shall bring **calamity and retribution** (犯之必至殃考).*

On auspicious days, select ancient *Feng* wood (枫) and craft a **Nine Palaces Plate** (九宫盘).
Six inches square, inscribe the **Eight Trigrams of the Nine Palaces** (九宫八卦),
erecting **upper and lower palaces** (上下二方) within the central palace.
Use **three unrefined colors** (三素之色) for the **embroidered silk** (彩缯).

round in face, one inch or so in diameter,

For all matters of **salvation and deliverance** (度),

**and harmonize the Qi** (而通炁).

*"Then the incantation reads:
**Yellow Central Scripture Qi slays the demonic sect** (黄中策炁斩祆宗),
**detect and subdue the powerful demonic spirits** (察制强精断邪翁).
**Supreme has command, Supreme’s Residence** (太上有命太上房),
**hasten to summon the Northern Emperor to the Jade Palace** (急召北帝诣玉宫).

*"**Secret Incantation for Clearing the Path** (执符开通道路密咒曰):

*"Recite three times,
**take Tian Men Qi and blow one breath onto the talisman** (取天门炁一口吹符上),
**and strike the incantation** (弹诀).
Then **take the Scripture for Breaking Filth** (再搯破秽诀),
**burn the talisman at the Ghost Gate** (烧符於鬼门上)."*

「Again, the incantation states:
**Yuan Shi’s Talisman Command** (元始符命),
**elevate at the appointed hour** (时刻升迁).

Master Zhang Wanfu said:
Before **the Celestial Venerable** (天尊) expounded the **Scriptures** (经), the **demon kings of the Three Realms and Hundred Worlds** (诸天三界魔王), the **Great Demons of the Five Emperors** (五帝大魔), all were the **ancestral deities of ten thousand spirits** (万神之宗), commanding the **hosts of ghosts**, roaming the **vast heavens**, and calling themselves **Heru** (赫奕), matching the **Celestial Sovereign’s** (天) achievements in power, wielding **menacing influence and malevolent poison**, afflicting and tormenting the multitudes.

Both men and women, through **prayer and ritual offerings** (祷祝鼓舞), sought to **honor and revere** them with **awe** (以敬畏迎).

After **the Celestial Venerable** expounded the **Scriptures**, the **hundred demons were subdued** (百魔伏化), and **the Divine Official** (神公) received his command, sweeping away all **inauspicious omens** (不祥), so that **demons dared not trespass** (魔无干犯) and **ghosts dared not manifest as fiends** (鬼无妖精). Once the demons were subdued by the **Celestial Venerable’s holy transformation** (天尊圣化), they became **the lofty saints of the Hundred Worlds** (诸天上圣), **the True Ones of Wondrous Practice** (妙行真人), leading the **celestial chariot** (策驾) and **pioneering the Dao** (前驱), sweeping away dust and opening the path.

Thus, when the **saints** (众圣) wish to **ascend to heaven** (进天), they first recite the **demon kings as pioneers** (前驱策驾) in their **ritual invocations** (念).

The **Scripture** says:
*"The Demon King reverently accepts his duties,
therefore he is able to **pay homage to the Celestial Sovereigns** (朝诸天)."*

Thus, the **practice of transcending the mundane** (步虚) requires first **contemplating the command to subdue demons** (存思命魔).
Here, the **threefold invocation of the commanded demons** (三朝命魔) is complete—all as Master Zhang Qingdu has spoken.

Master Zhao Dao Sheng revised the **Yellow Arrow Ritual** (黄箓仪), believing that **internal affairs end with the midday invocation of the commanded demons** (午朝命魔), as it was based on the **original Zhenghe Golden Arrow Ritual** (本政和金箓).
This is where his understanding faltered; it is not the **intent of the Scripture** (经旨).

**Sacrificial Offering and Invocation to the True Lord of Dark and Mysterious** (玄武祭祝章)
The **imperial subject** (皇人) says:
**The Dark and Mysterious** (玄武) is the **manifestation of the Primordial Dark** (玄元之化身), embodying the **two celestial lodges of Xu and Wei** (抱虚危之二宿), and merging the **two essences of water and fire** (合水火之两精). His voice **resonates through the Nine Heavens** (声振九天), and his might **subdues the demonic legions** (威降魔部).

For those who **practice Daoist discipline** (行持之士), when they **pay homage to the True Lord** (朝真望阙), entering **serenity and focusing their spirit** (入靖存神), they all invoke the **Dark and Mysterious Deity** (玄武之神) through the **sacred talisman of spiritual communion** (通灵符), perform the **Daoist ritual** (法箓), and **drive away pestilence** (驱除瘟), **slaying malevolent demons** (剪灭邪魔). If their **devotion and practice are sincere** (察其行道之心纯), they will be **recommended to the Jade Emperor** (保举於玉帝).
With **pious hearts**, their offerings and invocations are never in vain.
This is the **companion talisman** (从将者) within the **Soul-Treasure Dao** (灵宝法).

**The Invocatory Scripture** (祝文)
**The Celestial Hearer is humble** (天听甚卑), yet **heeds all spoken words** (有言而必察).
**The Divine Mirror is near** (神鉴不远), so that **no wish remains unfulfilled** (无愿而不成).
When **the horn moves, the palace responds** (角动角而宫应宫),
and **when sincerity is felt, virtue summons virtue** (诚感诚而德召德).
Even if **the wicked fast and bathe in purification** (虽恶人斋戒沐浴),
their **devotion to the Emperor is sincere** (事帝惟恭).

For the **uninitiated**, their **Dao is shallow and their injuries swift** (夫末学道浅疾伤), yet they **gain blessings through incense offerings** (行香获福), **reverently petitioning the Celestial Venerable** (仰启玄天大圣), and **taking refuge in the Northern Pole Deity** (依皈北极之神).
They **draw upon the radiance of the sun** (禀日光) to **form their bodies** (生形),
and **absorb the essence of yin** (含阴精) to **receive their substance** (受质).
They **nurture the spirit** (生神灵),
and **cultivate courage and vigor** (长勇猛),
**solely dedicated to Daoist practice** (惟务修行),
**assisting the Jade Emperor** (辅玉帝),
**beheading demons and fiends** (斩妖魔),
**thus saving all beings** (斯救群品).

He **wears the purple robe and golden belt** (佩紫袍金带),
**rides upon the Azure Tortoise and Vermilion Serpent** (履苍龟巨蛇),
**whose sword’s light pierces the void between Xu and Wei** (剑光射虚危之间),
**whose spirit-qi divides the Wu and Qi regions** (神炁冲吴齐之分).
**The Six Ding spirits** (六丁) **escort him before** (前拥),
**the Eight Sha spirits** (八煞) **follow him behind** (后随).
He **commands all spirits** (神统万灵),
**dominates the Five Great Mountains** (威镇五岳),
**soars through the heavens and overturns the earth** (腾天倒地),
**pulls lightning and races through the clouds** (掣电奔云),
**shatters demons and fiends** (破碎妖魔),
**scatters malevolent ghosts and thieves** (飘荡鬼贼).
All **hundred spirits obey his command** (百灵咸遵戒令),
and **minor ghosts dare not reveal their forms** (小鬼不敢现形).
Thus, **the people suffer no untimely deaths** (人民无横夭之尤),
and **the land enjoys peace and prosperity** (家国有安宁之庆).
All **petitions are answered** (所祈必应),
and **all responses are communicated** (有感咸通).

I, **the humble subject**, am fortunate to **participate in the Great Dao** (参大法),
**receiving the sacred chapter of the Soul-Treasure Dao** (受灵宝之玄章).
**Wearing the seal and performing talismans** (佩印行符),
I **follow the celestial decrees of the Primordial One** (应天元之节度).
I **establish this ritual altar** (建兹坛陛) to **ward off filth and evil** (秽恶侵凌),
and **invite your luminous spirit** (舍尔灵明) to **temporarily reside here** (叨啖有室).
It is **not through false reliance on the power of the deities** (非假威神之力),
but **how else could I attain such ease and joy** (曷为逸乐之方)?

At this **auspicious hour of descent** (式逢下降之辰),
I **specially present these offerings** (特启供陈之礼).
I **humbly hope** (仰冀) that your **divine light shines upon us** (神光晖映),
that your **holy power subtly permeates** (圣力潜通).
May **the spirit not become a ghost** (神不鬼) and **the ghost not become a spirit** (鬼不神),
May **the righteous not be confused with the wicked** (正不邪) and **the wicked not be mistaken for the righteous** (邪不正).
May you **fulfill all just petitions** (克应有求之愿),
and **dispel all unjust calamities** (潜消无妄之灾).

Thus, **peace and governance flourish** (即使靖治兴隆),
and **the demon kings tremble in fear** (魔王畏惧).
I **earnestly seek to record my merits** (早着功勋之籍),
and **quickly attain the Great Dao’s accomplishments** (速成大道之功).
I **bow my head and kneel twice** (臣稽首再拜).

**Summoning the Jade Talisman of Dark and Mysterious** (召玄武玉符)
**The Five Blessings descend, the Six Truths are established** (福德立降玄真六字).
This talisman **invokes the Block of Kan** (搯子文), and the incantation is:
*"The **Brahma Path** (梵行) **pervades the Ten Directions** (诸天), encircling all **worlds** (十方).
**The Boundless Great Deity** (无量大神) **all originates from my body** (皆由我身).
I **command this talisman**: wherever it goes, **the Dark merges with the Mysterious** (混玄合冥).
**Swiftly, swiftly, as the decree** (急急如律令)."*

**Sacrificial Offering and Invocation to the Northern Pole** (供侍北辰祭祝章)
I **reverently hear** (恭闻) that before **the Great Ultimate was divided** (太极未分),
**the Three Talents were set aside** (舍三才) to **encircle the One Qi** (周一气).
Once **the Two Principles were distinguished** (两仪既判),
**the Seven Governors were aligned** (齐七政) to **balance the Four Seasons** (均四时).
The **Lunar Lodge of the Great Dipper** (斗极) **was positioned in the Central Heaven** (运斗极於中天),
and the **celestial stations were arranged beyond the constellations** (布星躔於象外).
**The stars were assigned to govern transformations** (分司阐化),
and the **Northern Pole was established to uphold heaven** (立极承天).
The **Eight Kings** (八王) are the **ancestral deities of the myriad worlds** (万汇之宗),
and the **Seven Saints** (七圣) are the **forebears of all beings** (众生之祖).
They **command the qi of the seventy-two seasonal divisions** (总七十二候之炁),
and **govern the twenty-eight lunar mansions** (运二十八宿之司).
They **rotate the Dipper Enclosure** (旋转斗垣),
and **circuit the earth’s track** (周临地轨).
They **serve as the celestial chariot’s wheels** (为车而调理纲纪),
and **bow to the Pole** (拱辰) to **regulate the cosmos** (统制乾坤).
Their **words and tongues are the messengers** (喉舌是司),
and they **hold the pivot and mechanism** (枢机是握).
They **demonstrate the time indicated by the stars** (示魒星之所指),
so that **the Four Seas know the seasons** (四海知时).
They **observe the radiance of the star-qi** (观罡炁之有辉),
and **all Eight Extremes are blessed** (八纮咸福).
The **Three Celestial Enclosures harmonize in color** (三台齐色),
and the **Nine Spirits align in light** (九炁同光).
They **hold the celestial balance above** (掌天上之机衡),
and **determine the calamities and fortunes below** (定人间之祸福).

The **Han Emperor Ming** (汉明帝) **gazed upon their luminous guidance** (仰瞻光范),
and **Master Zhang** (张天师) **received the true Scripture** (参受真经),
**establishing the Mysterious Dao in the dusty world** (立玄教於尘寰),
and **liberating the common folk from the worldly net** (脱凡愚於世网).
Even more so, **all living beings** (动植) **have refuge here** (实有依皈).

I, **the humble subject**, **reverently practice the Great Dao** (恭行大法),
**salvaging and guiding those living and dead** (济度存亡).
If I **do not rely on the rotation of the Two Dippers** (不藉二斗之回旋),
or the **sequential order of the Kan and Li stars** (运坎离之逆顺),
I **could not complete the Daoist practice** (欲成道法).
I **owe it all to the Celestial Balance** (全假璇衡).

I **humbly encounter this hour of descent** (伏遇下降之辰),
and **specially prepare the offerings of lamps and candles** (特具灯烛之供).
I **humbly hope** (伏冀) that the **Seven Stars observe and judge** (七星垂鉴),
and that the **cloud-chariot temporarily departs from the Pivot of the Heavens** (云軿暂离於枢霄).
The **Two Emperors** (二帝) **greatly descend** (丕临),
and their **feathered chariots rest upon the ritual platform** (羽驾权驻於坛墠).
They **record the names of the living** (注上生籍),
and **erase the names of the dead** (勾落死名).
The **true qi of the Seven Elements** (七元之真炁) **constantly replenishes** (常充),
and the **spirit lords of the Five Zang organs** (五脏之神君) **each preserve their domain** (各保).
I **early gain the Dao of True Constancy** (早获真常之道),
and **quickly cultivate the wind of purity** (速成清净之风).
I **bow my head and kneel twice** (臣谨稽首再拜).

**Summoning the Jade Talisman of the Northern Dipper** (召北斗玉符)
**Silently invoke the Four Characters of the Celestial Balance** (默运璇玑四字).
This talisman **invokes the Block of Kan** (搯子文), and the incantation is:
*"The **Celestial Balance and Jade Talisman** (璇玑玉衡),
**halt all wheels at once** (一时停轮).
**Wielding the talisman and grasping the ritual** (执符把箓),
**we all align before the Emperor** (齐到帝前)."*

Thousand harmonies unite, ten thousand merge in truth—
naturally attaining the Real.
**Swiftly, swiftly, as the Supreme Gem’s Grand Legal Edict commands.**

**Summoning the Chapter of the Body’s Spirit**
The Mystic Master says:
All who recite the sacred texts,
offering repentance and beseeching grace,
must thrice daily at midday honor the Mystic.
At every Daoist practice,
offer incense at the six solar hours.

The three daily offerings are:
at sunrise, noon, and sunset.
Other rituals follow their own methods.

The six solar hours are:
midnight, dawn, meal-time, noon, feeding-time, and dusk—
the six yang hours.
The so-called six-hour incense offerings
are precisely these six times.

The incense ash must not be from hearth-fire,
for it contains hidden dragon dung—
a great taboo of the Dao.
Instead, use pine or cypress branches,
burned to ash and stored in a furnace.
To achieve fierce flames and abundant fragrance,
let the smoke rise in one surge—
sincerity ascends with it,
untainted by lingering haze.

If reciting, let the smoke be unbroken,
a continuous thread.
Within the burning incense,
avoid pungent vegetables, gamey meats,
bitter herbs, or creatures with shells or fur—
lest you profane the Celestial Worthies.

The Supreme Extremity Immortal often mixes willow and bamboo ash
with mallow stems and leaves, pounded into blocks,
with a touch of sweet osmanthus—
and it lacks nothing.
This incense not only lights swiftly,
but burns long—
neither fading nor smoldering.
Used abundantly, it blazes fiercely;
used sparingly, it lingers.

The Immortal also often takes ancient vine roots,
washed in clear springs,
dried in sunlight,
then mixed with greenwood incense and *Scrophularia ningpoensis*,
pounded and burned—
purifying impurities, attuning sincerity,
summoning the Celestial Worthies and inviting the Immortals.
No harsh or pungent fumes may be used.

The method of burning incense:
calm the mind, focus intent,
single-minded in devotion.
Do not turn back to the smoke—
contain the *qi*, steady the breath,
and silently pray as you bow.
The principle of heart-bowing:
lest the Nine Palaces tilt,
keep the body upright,
bending only as the heart directs.

The sovereign of the body lies in *shen* and *qi*.
When *shen* and *qi* align,
the True is communicated, the Mystic reached.
If *shen* wanders and *qi* is carved away,
how shall the gods respond to prayer?
Much less when the body’s Gem is whole,
for the soul resides in the *shen*—
thus, heart-bowing is *shen*-bowing.

The *Lingbao* Five Talismans’ Secret Sequence
contains a method to summon the gods.
This is the foremost of ten thousand Dao,
the first of all methods.

Its practice is on days:
*Jiazi*, one’s birth-day,
the second and sixteenth of the month,
and the last day—
five times monthly.
Enter the Chamber of Tranquility,
purify the heart and mind,
delight in simple foods and pure drink,
offering eight kinds of fruit alone.
Face east, sit upright,
gather the heart, still the *qi*,
settle the breath, calm the spirit for a time,
then offer incense three times,
and strike the teeth twenty-four times.

The incantation:
*"Dan Yuan True Person, Tai Yi True Person,
Tao Kang True Person, Tai Guang True Person,
You Jing True Person, Shuang Ling True Person,
Mei Shen Heavenly Spirit, Nao Shen Yuan Xian,
Ding Shen Dong Wang, Er Shen Jiao Nü,
Mu Shen Ying Ming, Fa Shen Chang Shou,
Bi Shen Tong Ling, Kou Shen Dan Zhu,
She Shen Dan Huang, Chi Shen Wei Shi,
Hou Shen Hu Bin, Jian Shen Yu Ling,
Shou Shen Yun Yin, Xin Shen Hou Hou,
Gan Shen Lin Lin, Fei Shen Zhu Zhu,
Qi Shen Yu Lu, Wei Shen Zu Zu,
Pi Shen Bi Bi, Shen Shen Piao Piao,
Dan Shen Huo Huo,
Dan Tian Shen Cang Jing,
Da Chang Shen Tuo Tuo, Xiao Chang Shen Liang Liang,
Yang Shen Qiong Ying, Yin Shen You Ling,
Bi Shen Yin Yin, Xi Shen Ou Ou,
Yao Shen Kong Nan, Zu Shen Xuan Yuan,
Da Li Tian Ding."*

Call them three times:
*"You who dwell within my body,
take your seats before, behind, left, and right,
each in your proper place.
Today is a lucky day—
we sacrifice to you.
Eat and drink to your fill,
drink until drunk, feast until sated,
and stop only when satisfied."*

After the prayer,
imagine a hundred or so spirits as if they were real,
and bow to them in greeting,
offering food and drink until satisfied.

Again, the incantation:
*"You who are now drunk and full,
rejoice without end.
On lucky days, when summoned, you will come.
On ordinary days, do not leave me.
All future fortune and misfortune,
report them to me one by one.
I know my body harbors you,
and you know my sorrows.
If there are immortal elixirs,
bring them to me and take them from me.
Let me share my food with you.
Nurture all living things until the kalpa’s end.
Now return to my body,
each to your domain."*

**Swiftly, swiftly, as the Edict commands.**

The Mystic Master says:
Know before it happens,
die in the body and ascend to the Primordial,
transcend to the True—
this is the priority.
After ten sacrifices,
you may converse with the spirits.
After a hundred sacrifices,
you may attain the elixir of immortality,
golden pills, and spiritual mushrooms—
food and drink both complete.

A single leak of this teaching
wastes ten years of effort,
rendering your own practice ineffectual—
**guard it carefully, do not transmit it recklessly.**

**The Chapter of the Illuminating Lamp Breaking the Prison**

Take the fire of the **Great Sun**.

The Mystic Master says:
In the past, the Ancestral Master spoke of the *Three Primordial Edicts* and the **Illuminating Lamp Method**—this is the most solemn and weighty of all teachings.
Yet when the **Dark Obscurity** is pierced by a single light,
all torments cease and all sufferings are stilled;
the iron prison is boundless,
but with illumination, its gates swing open.

The **Yellow Edict Method** comprises the nine rites of the **Nine Abyssal Offerings**, including the **Returning Radiance Wheel Lamp**, the **Nine Canisters of Divine Light**, and the **Nine-Prison Lamps**.
It dispels the darkness of eternal night,
illuminates the sufferings of the **Three Paths**,
borrows the **Daoist Sage’s** wisdom and power,
and shares the **Highest Saint’s** radiance and glory—
piercing the cold bars,
universally opening the **Netherworld’s** soil.

At the start of the **Illuminating Lamp** ritual,
the **Dharma Master** writes the **Palm of Illumination** with cinnabar,
first at **midday**, reciting the **Returning Radiance Divine Incantation**,
using the **Sun-Mirror** to capture the **Great Sun’s** true *qi*,
and lighting a single torch before the **Celestial Sovereign’s** image.

At night, the **Great Dharma Master** and the two **Attendant Lamp Masters** stand before the image,
perform nine prostrations,
and strike their teeth nine times.
They pray for the **Yellow Edict Offering’s** intent,
then perform nine more prostrations.

The **Great Dharma Master** kneels long,
whispers the **Divine Incantation of the Lamp’s Illumination** three times,
strikes his teeth three times,
holds the talisman,
and with the *qi* of the **Sacred Image**, blows upon the talisman,
before the **Celestial Sovereign** to request the lamp’s light.

Advancing three steps,
the two **Attendant Lamp Masters** again request the light before the **Dharma Master**,
forming three torches,
then proceed to distribute the lamps to the **Three Abodes**.

When the ritual concludes,
they grasp the remaining torch and combine it into one,
the **Great Dharma Master** holding the torch before the image,
performing nine prostrations before retreating.

Thus, the **Illuminating Lamp’s** light shines through the **Netherworld’s** darkness,
and the **Dark Obscurity**’s beings attain liberation through its opening.

The **Illuminating Lamp’s** wax and oil must not be tainted by **vile substances**,
nor rendered impure;
it must be full and abundant,
to complete the ritual itself—
**take care not to extinguish it prematurely.**

**The Ritual of Distributing the Lamp to Break the Darkness**

*"In the beginning, the **Primordial One** opened the **Yellow Edict Gate**.
The **Mystic Radiance** perfected its ninefold nature,
and the **Sacred Pattern** was inscribed by **Nature’s** own decree.
The **Three Manifestations**—one hidden, one revealed—
comprehend the **Three Fullnesses** of **Transformation** for **Humans and Heaven**,
their grace flowing through the cosmos,
and now they borrow the **Lamp’s** radiance,
its essence drawn from the **Great Primordial**.*

Following the **Ram’s Horn** in proper order,
and adhering to the **Celestial Compass’s** principles,
the **Upper Radiance** illuminates the **Nine Heavens**,
and the **Three Lights** increase their brilliance.
The **Lower Radiance** shines upon the **Nine Earths**,
and the **Ten Prisons** cease their torments—
its benefits extend to the **Netherworld**,
its grace touches **water and land**.

*"I humbly pray that the **Primordial Sovereign** opens the **Transformation** and issues decrees,
and that the **Celestial Master** reverently distributes the radiance.
With sincere praise and invocation,
I call upon the **Great Sage, Primordial Sovereign**.*

**Requesting the Primordial Sovereign’s Lamp**
Recite the incantation:

*"The Primordial One’s essence is the **Great Radiance**,
the **Celestial Ancestor’s** abode is vast and dark.
Merged with the **Void**, it fills the **Empty**,
faintly leaving the **Original Thread**.
The **Great Passage** opens the **Mystic Gate**,
and the **Divine Clouds** descend in solemnity.
With **Yang** and **Yin**, the **Sacred Embryo** commands the **Divine Exchange**,
the **Ten Thousands of Truths** harmonize in splendor,
awakening the **Nine Heavens’** court.
The **Nine Heavens’** talismans are decreed,
and the **Ten Billions of Aeons** transcend the **Divine**.*

*"I humbly pray that the Primordial Sovereign’s radiance descends,
borrowing the **Dao** to extend the **Celestial Emperor’s** rule.
The **Jade Capital** glows within,
and its light reaches the **Master’s** altar.
The essence enters the **Divine**,
one generates two—
with reverence and devotion,
the **Transformation** ascends in flight.
I call upon the **Great Sage, Lingbao Sovereign**.*

**Requesting the Upper Clarity’s Lamp**
Recite the incantation:

*"The **Celestial Emperor’s** truth begins its radiance,
the **Great Sage’s** essence is the **Primordial**.
The **Single Spirit** guides the *qi*,
and within, it guards the form.
The **Great Void** responds in unity,
and **Heaven and Earth** merge in light.
The **Primordial Function** is auspicious and perfect,
and the **Two Scenes** generate the **Divine**.
Today’s **Transformation** ascends,
and the **Celestial Court** is entered.*

*"I humbly pray that the **Three Manifestations** of **Ten Thousands of Beings**,
collect the **Ancestral *Qi*** within the **Void Emperor**,
all seeing the **Ten Directions**,
to awaken the **Multitudes of Lost Souls**.
The **Master’s** light is merciful and liberating,
and all who feel its touch are illuminated.
The **Law’s** power is manifest and clear,
and no darkness remains unpenetrated.
The **Pure Radiance** is distributed to the **Three Realms**,
and the **Sovereign’s** form is revealed to the **Ten Thousands**.
With utmost reverence and devotion,
the **Nine Heavens** observe with delight.*

*I call upon the **Great Sage, Bright Sovereign**.*

**Requesting the Supreme Clarity’s Lamp**
Recite the incantation:

*"The **Celestial Master** descends in floating splendor,
the **Jade Sovereign** alights in resplendent grace.
The **Sacred Embryo** nurtures the **Soul and Vitality**,
and the **Three Departments and Eight Scenes** divide its radiance.
Within the **Void**, eternal life is attained,
and with reverence, the **Mystic Gate** is entered.
The **Great Micro** returns the **Yellow Banner**,
and the **Unmatched** commands the **Divine Pennant**.
It summons the **Eternal Night Palace**,
and opens the **Transformation** for the **Received Souls**.*

**The Lamp’s Light Illuminates the Celestial Sovereign**

*"I humbly pray that the **Void and Mystic** cut through death,
and that the **Sacred Radiance** pierces the **Dark Obscurity**.
The **Jade Tablet** forms the altar,
and the **Law-Bridge** is opened for liberation.
The **Divine Light** blazes in splendor,
and the **Dark Night** becomes radiant.
The **Assembled Congregation** unites in sincerity,
and the radiance descends to the **Earthly Realm**.*

The **Celestial Sage** says:
*"If one wishes to offer and rescue the **Netherworld Spirits**,
or to light the lamp that breaks the darkness,
one must obtain the **Palm of Illumination**,
only then can the **Three Lights’** wisdom
connect with the **Common Fire’s** radiance,
and only then can they hope to summon and liberate those beings.*

*If this method is absent,
then the **Common Fire’s** light alone
cannot transcend its own limitations.*

*On the **Day of Rectification**,
at **midday’s first hour**,
burn incense to the **southwest**,
and facing the **Great Sun**, absorb its *qi* and blow upon the brush.
Perform two prostrations and kneel long,
writing the **Twelve Dao Passages**—
when the light is emitted,
use this talisman."*

**The Talisman of the Lamp’s Illumination**
*(Right side: length nine inches, inscribed in red on yellow paper,
using the **Jade Clarity’s** method, with **eastern *qi*** blown upon it,
the wax melted and applied to the talisman’s reverse,
twisted into a torch for use.)*

**The Talisman of the Three Scenes’ Illumination**
*(Incantation follows.)*

**The Talisman of the Lamp’s Illumination (Continued)**

**Incantation:**
*"Heavenly Sage of Illuminating Light,
Pierce the deepest darkness.
The Three Lights radiant,
Penetrate the cosmos’ depths.
Suffering souls, bound in corpses,
All bathe in boundless brilliance.
The Two Scenes endless,
Merciful wisdom forever preserved.
This talisman, inscribed in red on yellow paper,
With the **Three Lights’ true *qi*** blown into it—
**The Secret Method to Break the Nine Abysses**
*(The Royal Sage speaks:)*
*‘The Nine Abysses*—
*These are the transformations of the **Nine Stars of the Big Dipper** into the Nine Netherworld Prisons.
Spread across the **Nine Regions**,
*Eastern Abyss* is **Yūmíng** (幽冥), the prison of wind and thunder;
*Southern Abyss* is **Yūyīn** (幽阴), the prison of fire’s eclipse;
*Western Abyss* is **Yūyè** (幽夜), the prison of **Jīngāng** (金刚, adamantine severity);
*Northern Abyss* is **Yūhēng** (幽酆), the prison of **Mínglíng** (溟泠, boundless waters);
*Northeastern Abyss* is **Yūdū** (幽都), the prison of **Niǔtáng** (镬汤, boiling cauldron);
*Southeastern Abyss* is **Yūzhì** (幽治), the prison of **Tóngzhù** (铜柱, copper pillars);
*Southwestern Abyss* is **Yūguān** (幽关), the prison of **Túgē** (屠割, slaughter);
*Northwestern Abyss* is **Yūfǔ** (幽府), the prison of **Huǒchē** (火车, fiery chariots);
*The Central Abyss* is **Yūyù** (幽狱), the prison of **Pùluē** (普掠, universal punishment).

*Each is governed by a **Community Official** within its respective region.
Those born in **Zǐ-Hòu** (子丑) belong to the **Northern Abyss** of **Mínglíng** (溟泠).
Those born in **Wǔ** (午) belong to the **Southern Abyss** of **Huǒyì** (火翳).
Those born in **Yín-Mào** (寅卯) belong to the **Eastern Abyss** of wind and thunder.
Those born in **Wèi** (巳) belong to the **Southeastern Abyss** of **Tóngzhù** (铜柱).
Those born in **Wèi-Shēn** (未申) belong to the **Southwestern Abyss** of **Túgē** (屠割).
Those born in **Yǒu** (酉) belong to the **Western Abyss** of **Jīngāng** (金刚).
Those born in **Hài** (亥) belong to the **Northwestern Abyss** of **Huǒchē** (火车).
Those born in **Chén-Xū** (辰戌) belong to the **Central Abyss** of **Pùluē** (普掠).

*‘To practice the **Method of Summoning and Liberating** souls,
One must first understand the Nine Abysses,
And with wisdom break their darkness—
Then the lost souls may be liberated.
If one does not know these prisons,
How can they be summoned?

*The **Method to Break the Abysses** is thus:
*Focus the **middle finger of the left hand**,
And visualize the **Sage’s Form** of each direction,
Drawing upon the **native *qi* of that region** to blow and strike.
In the **East**, manifest as **Jade Treasure’s Imperial Sage** (玉宝皇上天尊),
In the **South**, manifest as **Mystic True Blessing’s Heavenly Sage** (玄真万福天尊),
And in the other directions, likewise visualize the **Holy Stations** of each.

*In the **East**, take **nine steps** of **Dīnggāng** (丁罡),
In the **South**, take **three steps** of **Dīnggāng** (丁罡),
In the **West**, take **seven steps** of **Dīnggāng** (丁罡),
In the **North**, take **five steps** of **Dīnggāng** (丁罡),
In the **Four Intermediate Directions**, take **five steps each** of **Dīnggāng** (丁罡),
In the **Center**, take **twelve steps** of **Dīnggāng** (丁罡).
*All must summon the **Three-Colored Light of Primordial Essence’s Sacred Treasure** (元始灵宝祖炁三色之光)
To pierce their depths.

*Further, visualize the **Five Emperors’ Scepters**,
Transformed into the **Supreme Decree’s Scepter** (上帝节杖),
With **Golden Boys and Jade Girls**—
Twelve on each side—
Holding **Treasure Banners**,
Upon which is inscribed in gold:
**‘Jade Emperor’s Pardon of Crimes, Illuminating Sage’** (玉皇赦罪天尊).

*In each prison’s direction,
Visualize an **Iron City** of ten thousand *zhàng* (丈),
Netherworld snares entangled,
Black mists descending,
Foul *qi* billowing—
**Copper Serpents** spitting flames,
**Iron Hounds** spewing smoke,
Ghostly guards and **Yèchā** (夜叉, night demons)
Locking the gates.
*Manifest your **Divine Form** within the **Hundred Treasures’ Radiant Light** (百宝光明),
Connect with the **Primordial Essence’s Three *qi*** (元始三炁),
And charge directly at the city.
*When the **Iron City crumbles**,
The **Mountain of Knives** snaps,
The **Swords** dissolve into **Sword Forests** (剑化骞林),
The **Mountain of Fire** extinguishes,
The **Ice Pools** still their waves,
Those who devour fire and consume charcoal
Transform into **Sweet Dew**,
The **Boiling Cauldron** ceases its heat,
The **Golden Hammer and Iron Rod** become **Lotus Flowers** (变成莲花).

*The prisoners within the Abyss—
When the **Banner points** and the **Light illuminates**,
Their **Fetters and Shackles** fall away,
Their sufferings all cease,
All awaken to their **Original Source**,
Hatred and grudges dissolve,
The prison guards strike their palms in approval,
All exclaiming: *“Good! Good!”*
Gazing upward in praise of the **Sage’s Compassion**,
They rise with the **Radiant Light**,
And exit the **Abyssal Realm** (幽冥之界).

**The Diagram of the Nine Abysses’ Lamps**
*(The Mystic Master says:)*
*‘Following the **Heaven’s Pattern and Earth’s Model**,
The **Square and Round** are its form.
*The Nine Abysses and **Yīn Cáo** (阴曹, Netherworld),
Hold authority over **punishments and laws**,
And their dominion lies in **Lóhēng Dōngnán** (罗酆东南, the southeastern nether regions).

*According to the **Teachings of the Supreme Unity’s Holy Truth** (太一圣真之科),
*Construct nine **altars** of **Nine Earth Stones** (土九石),
Each **altar two *chǐ* (尺) in size,
And the nine **altars arranged in a square** of **six *chǐ* (尺) each,
To embody the **Earth’s Symbol of Yin Extremity** (二六之象).

*Each altar bears **four diagrams in three bends**,
Like the shape of prisons.
*One altar holds **three lamps**, nine altars together **twenty-seven lamps**.

*At the **eastern center** of the altar,
Erect the **Treasure Banner for Divine Transfer** (迁神宝幡).
*Within the **nine altars’ core**, set a **tablet**,
Inscribed on its face with the **True Talisman of Jade Clarity’s Breakthrough of the Netherworld** (玉清破地狱真符),
And on its back with the **prison’s name** (狱名).
*Beside it, plant **nine green bamboo poles**, each **nine *chǐ* (尺) long,
And hang a small **banner** from each,
Inscribed with the **Holy Titles of the Twelve Treasures’ Illuminating Sages** (十方灵宝天尊圣号),
With the **Talisman of the Netherworld Capital** (酆都符) written at the banner’s top."*

When the time comes to break the prison, the attending lamp-masters shall recite the *Break-Prison Rite* in proper sequence, and the master shall wield the **Sacred Treasure Staff**, chanting the *Break-Prison Spell*, while the assembly responds with the *Holy Titles of the Twelve Treasures’ Illuminating Sages*. Then, at the lamps, they shall burn the talismans and banners over the prison.

The master shall strike the eight directions of the Netherworld with the staff, completing all sides before reaching the center, where the second talisman and banner are burned—following the same method as the other directions.

The *Essentials of Jade Clarity* are invoked, summoning a yellow cloud to cover one direction, and the master assumes the form and bearing of a Celestial Sage.

For each prison, nine *kòu* (叩) strikes are delivered before and after the spell.

Thus shall the Netherworld open, and the departed ascend to the Dao.

Never to rekindle like dead ashes.

**Chapter on the Burning Lamp to Break the Prisons**
**Ritual of Radiant Return and Descending Light**

The Mystic Master said:
*"The Ritual of the Radiant Return and Descending Light* adheres to the *Alliance of the True*—
It expiates the Five Bonds of Suffering,
Opens the Dao of birth-and-death,
And shatters the court of darkness where crimes are tried.

*The Method:*
A wheel is crafted from *zhi-mu* wood,
Resembling a chariot’s axle.
Its upper tier holds twelve lamps in bowls,
Its middle tier sixteen,
Its lower tier twenty-one—
A total of forty-nine lamps.

At the center stand the Five Bonds of Suffering.
Each prison’s name is inscribed on tablets.
According to the *Radiant Return Lamp Ritual*,
Forty-nine small silk banners are made—
Alternating yellow and white—
With the sacred titles of the Celestial Honored Ones
Emblazoned at their heads,
And the *Talisman to Break the Tartarus Realm* inscribed in vermilion.

The Master of the Law intones the *Lamp Ritual*,
While the Great Master wields the staff,
His left hand holding the *Jade Purity Decet*,
His right gripping the staff.
Following the expiatory rites, he stands before each prison,
Plants the staff upright,
Recites the *Hidden Mantra of the Great Brahman*,
And sprinkles with willow-branch purified water.
Then, at the lamps, he burns the small silk banners.

Thus, the tormented spirits of these prisons,
Riding the yang-light,
Are instantly liberated from all suffering,
Severed from the Five Bonds of affliction and malevolent obstructions,
And forever freed from the roots of dusty toil.

Moreover, on the wheel’s east and west,
A crimson banner thirty-six *chi* long is crafted—
Its top adorned with a golden mudra,
Depicting the *Central Dipper* constellation.
The banner’s body bears, in large seal script,
The four characters *Radiant Return Sacred Banner*,
Followed by three empty spaces,
Then the title *Turning Wheel Celestial Sovereign*.
To its left, a sun is painted in color,
With the six characters *Idyllic Compliance Emperor of the Great Yang*.
To its right, a moon is painted in color,
With the six characters *Jade-Luster Sovereign of the Great Yin*.
At its base, the *Hymn of Radiant Return* is inscribed:

*"Radiant Return to the Purple Micro Palace,*
*Curved reflection at the Nine Abyssal Gates."*

Lofty and cold the barren hills and chilly pool,
Reflecting the encircling ice-bound shores.
Blazing the fiery hells’ torment,
Yet the Dao’s rain descends, refreshing and pure.

From endless night’s dark bonds I lift the soul,
Ascending to the Crimson Peak’s celestial hall.

This ritual stems from the *Tongxuan*’s forbidden lore—
Unless one’s merit calls it forth to reveal,
How could mortals hope to glimpse its light?

Who can restore the radiance of the Three Luminaries,
And bend the Nine Abyssal Gates to open wide?

Let water’s wrath and fire’s venom fade,
Let steel blades dull and iron fortresses melt,
Let ghostly judges cease their grim decrees,
And vanish the karmic debts of aeons past—
From endless suffering, raise the lost in throngs,
And those who see these lights shall rise to heaven’s path.

Tsai Zhi and Lu Shi, in ritual form,
Forged no wooden wheel but shaped it from sand—
Square without, round within, nine *chi* in span,
Three concentric rings like chariot wheels entwined.

The outermost ring bears twenty-four spokes,
The middle ring fifteen, the innermost nine.
At its heart stands the *Radiant Return Sacred Banner*,
And one lamp burning bright within its glow.

The nine inner spokes hold nine lamps alight,
Behind which stand inscribed the *Three Evil Gates*,
The *Three Emptiness Paths*, and the *Three Tutor Realms*.

The fifteen middle spokes bear fifteen lamps,
Behind which are marked the *Five Bonds of Suffering*,
The *Five Paths of Torment*, and the *Five Gates of Pain*.

The twenty-four outer spokes hold twenty-four lamps,
Behind which stand inscribed the *Twenty-Four Hells*.

Right, the three seals shall be inscribed on yellow paper with vermilion characters, and the declaration written in white silk. Recite the *Three Tutor’s Incantation*, station the Three Officials at either side, and together invoke the *True Essence* (真炁) into the seals. Once complete, apply the *Lingbǎo Great Law* stamp, and burn before the prison lamp. When burning, recite the *Supreme Decree Incantation*.

The incantation reads:
*"Yùqīng Bǎofú, Yuánshǐ Chìxíng.
Yōutú Yīngmìng, Sān Guān Jiěxíng.
Shèchú Bìxì, Duàn Yì Xiāomíng.
Suí Pǐn Shòuhuà, Wànshén Fèngxíng.
Níngbì, Tì Jié, Fén Dàojūn Chìshè.
Yùqīng Dàojūn Chìshè."*

When burning the *Supreme Decree of Pardon*, hold the *Yùqīng Incantation* in both hands, cradle the seals to your heart, and recite:
*"Yùqīng Dàojūn Chìshè, Shàngqīng Dàdì Chìshè, Tàiqīng Dàojūn Jiùshè,
Chìmìng Shí Fāng Língbǎo Jiùkǔ Tiānzūn,

The *Three Corpses Seal*—*Worldly Science of Soul Liberation*,
With the ritual of beheading the Three Corpses and opening the Five Sufferings Gates, based on the *Upper Clarity’s Cavernly True Scripture*.
*Yuánshǐ* recorded the *Supreme True Jade Incantation* thus:
*"To study the High Dao, one must dispel all desires,
And extinguish the evil roots of the path—
Then naturally descend to the Immortals, naturally attain perfection."*

Now, inscribe the *Changing Landscape’s Luminous Jade Seal* and apply it as per the text. This is the Seal of the Five Sufferings and the Three Corpses.

The *Upper Corpses Seal* is inscribed in green on black paper,
The *Middle Corpses Seal* in yellow on white paper,
The *Lower Corpses Seal* in white on white paper,
The *Color-Root Gate Seal* in black on white paper,
The *Love-Root Gate Seal* in white on white paper,
The *Greed-Root Gate Seal* in red on white paper,
The *Competitive Splendor Gate Seal* in green on white paper,
The *Body-Root Gate Seal* in yellow on white paper.

When applying the *Upper Corpses Seal*, affix it to the head;
The *Middle Corpses Seal* to the chest;
The *Lower Corpses Seal* and the Five Sufferings Seals to both feet.
Beneath the Three Evil Gates, kneel and strike your teeth nine times while reciting the incantation.

These are the *Worldly Science* incantations:
*"Upper Corpses: Pēngjū"*
*"Middle Corpses: Pēngzhì"*
*"Lower Corpses: Pēngjiǎo"*

This scripture has no incantation.
Now, having received the *Upper Clarity’s Treasure Talisman* at the altar, we establish the *Supreme Seal Law*.
Though it is said that *spiritual transformation has no fixed method* to save the dying,
It may also liberate the living.
Yet the *Three Corpses Beheading Incantation*,
When used for the deceased,
May still encounter obstacles.
Thus, it is now omitted.

The method of extinguishing the Three Evils
And swiftly liberating the Five Gates’ spirits
Belongs to the *Jade Clarity’s Sacred Seal Law*.
Invoke them as per the incantation,
Declare the talisman’s command,
And open the path for the departed souls—
This is logically permissible.

*Upper Corpses*
*Middle Corpses*

**Lower Corpses**

*They inscribe upon yellow silk and ingest it,*
*It may dispel the Three Corpses and banish the Five Sufferings.*
*Let the later disciples observe this diligently—*
*They shall surely encounter the True Way."*

**Scripture of the Eight Hardships Talismans and Incantations**
The Celestial Sage rescues all the lost,
Liberating them from the Eight Hardships.
Celebrating their rebirth within the human realm,
The Five Sufferings vanish in an instant.
Forever extinguished from the main currents of hell,
Their retribution conforms to the **Dao/Way**’s eternal law.
The **Xīyí** (Mysterious Sage) nurtures the young and tender,
Endless calamities are averted.

This talisman shall be inscribed on **green paper with white ink**,
Invoking the **Supreme Secret Formula**.
Once inscribed, it shall be burned at each gate of hell.

**Incantation for Burning:**
*The **Jade Clarity Sacred Treasure Talisman** ascends beyond the Eight Hardships,*
*Liberating from endless depths,*
*Attaining the far shore.*
*The **Dao/Way**’s profound mysteries,*
*Radiant as the sun’s light,*
*Reborn within the human realm,*
*Uttering great praises.*
As decreed by the **Jade Clarity Sacred Treasure Talisman**,
Conforming to the **Supreme Secret Formula**’s grand edict.

The **Dao/Way**’s Master declares:
*"Diligently observe the *Qīngwēi Bǎo Gé* (Pure Clarity Sacred Treasure Canon):
Yin **virtue/power** with merit surpasses ancestral trials,
Yang **virtue/power** manifests blessings for oneself.
Why not establish meritorious deeds to save those in the **Wujiàn** (No Interval) Hell,
Naturally, the Heavenly Emperor will bestow upon you the True **Dao/Way**?

Rebellious ministers and treacherous bandits sink forever into ruin,
Yet still cling to the **Qiúzé** (Differential Grace) and transform into insects.

For nine years, all the celestial realms rejoice and celebrate,
Clad in white armor, ascending clouds to pay homage to the **Jade Clarity** (Yùqīng).

The **Wujiàn** Hell is the realm of **Yōuyīn** (Dark Obscurity) and bitter suffering.
The Heavenly Emperor’s secret edicts for **Yōuyīn** (Dark Obscurity) punishments
Each have their fitting measures.

The four births and six paths of the mortal world,
Like a revolving wheel of death,
Have no rest or respite.
Unless one transcends the Three Realms,
Entering the natural **Dao/Way**,
How could they escape the suffering of rebirth?

Even the human realm extends to the **Róngmán Yídí** (barbarian lands),
Where the **Dao/Way**’s proper transformation does not reach,
And the sun’s light does not shine.
Yet all who bear the Three Karmas,
Six Roots, and Five Bondages,
Are still born as humans,
And universally governed by the Northern Heaven.

The Northern Heaven has three officials:
The Ghost Official, not the **Qīnglíng, Qīnghuá, Zǐqú** (Three Pure Officials).
This Ghost Official specializes in the Three Trials and retribution.

If one’s bodily karma is grave,
The Fire Official conducts the trial;
If one’s mental karma is grave,
The Recording Official conducts the trial;
If one’s verbal karma is grave,
The Water Official conducts the trial;
If all six roots and twofold karma are grave,
Then the **Wind Knife** (Fēngdāo) Official conducts the trial.

When humans are born,
From father’s essence and mother’s blood,
Congealing bones and nurturing flesh,
They form into body and shape.
The womb and embryo nurture,
Ten months of full completion,
When the **Tàiwēi** (Great Minute Star) descends its **qi** to generate the spirit,
The **Fēngxìng** (Wind Nature) follows the transformation,
And the soul and consciousness coalesce—
Only then is birth complete.

If born male, the Celestial Sage holds rank;
If born female, the Primordial Sovereign is named.
Yet due to their own threefold karma,
Six roots entanglement,
When their allotted time is exhausted,
They receive retribution according to their deeds:
Their flesh and sinews sink into the earth,
Their soul and spirit are bound in the netherworld,
Not from a past life’s horizontal death,
But by the **Shèlìng** (Community Order) and the **Tǔzhǔ** (Earthly Sovereign),
Confined in endless night,
Forever without escape.

If their karmic debts are repaid,
They are sent to the Ghostly Capital,
Yet even after ten thousand kalpas,
They cannot transcend rebirth.

If their crimes are many and merits few,
They endure the Five Sufferings before any chance of transformation arises.
If their merits are many and crimes few,
After one hellish cycle,
They shall attain the blessings of rebirth.
If both merits and crimes are sparse,
They are reborn according to their karma.
If there are no merits and crimes are grave,
They sink into endless ruin for ten thousand kalpas.

If the Fire Official conducts the trial,
Then the retributions of the Copper Column,
Iron Bed, Golden Soup Furnace Charcoal,
Fireous Marsh and Ash River,
Fire Chariot and Boiling Cauldron
Shall be met.

If the Water Official conducts the trial,
Then the retributions of the Ice Pool,
Frigid Pond, Poisonous Filth,
And foul stench
Shall be met.

If the Recording Official conducts the trial,
Then the retributions of the Golden Hammer,
Iron Rod
Shall be met.

If the **Wind Knife** Official conducts the trial,
Then the retributions of butchery and saw cleavage,
Flying lances and whirling spears,
Tongue extraction and field plowing,
Swift thunder and fierce winds,
Eightfold crossfire,
Severing body and mind,
Knife Mountains and Sword Trees,
Dismembering the form,
Fire Hounds and Poisonous Serpents,
Gnawing flesh and bone,
Burning bones and scorching skin,
Ash and dust consuming the spirit,
Day and night between endless birth and death,
Karmic winds scattering and reforming at will—
If the crimes are shallow,
The sufferings exhausted,
They still do not lose the human path,
Being reborn as lowly or base individuals,
Lacking proper features,
Or in the **Sìjí** (Four Extremes) of barbarian lands.

罪重业轻，生为六畜之形，
Tenfold or fivefold rebirths as beasts,
Yet still to return to the human path.

若也罪业重大，
But if crimes and karmic burdens are grave,
风刀考掠之后，
then after the Wind Knife’s trial and torment,
散飘神魂，
the soul scatters and drifts,
飞扬万方，
wafting across the ten directions,
随其胎卵湿化四生，
taking form in wombs, eggs, dampness, or rebirth in the four realms,
分形微细昆虫，
becoming minute insects of varied forms,
永无再生人身之路。
forever barred from human rebirth.

更有罪业少而过名大者，
There are those whose transgressions are slight
yet whose reputation of sin is vast—
备经三涂五苦之后，
after enduring the three realms’ torments and fivefold sufferings,
方入饿鬼之门，
they enter the realm of hungry ghosts,
再生劫运，
to undergo endless karmic cycles,
拘为长夜之徒，
bound as eternal night’s prisoners,
担沙负石，
hauling sand and bearing stones,
涟汲溟波，
sipping waves of the boundless ocean,
驱雷役电之后，
after being compelled to summon thunder and command lightning,
托生鬼道丑恶之报，
they are reborn into the ghastly paths of ghostly torments,
亿劫之中，
through countless eons,
永沉阴冥。
they sink into eternal darkness.

於是辛亥子酆都记云：
Thus, in the *Xīnhài Zǐ* records of the **Yùndū** (Netherworld),
有胎生之鬼，
there are ghosts born from wombs—
是此也。
these are the ones described above.

既生人世，
Once born into the human world,
举足动步，
every step and movement,
惟罪是修，
are but karmic retributions,
意志情累，
stemming from past intentions and afflictions,
皆为根业。
all rooted in past deeds.

善事善业，
Good deeds and virtuous actions—
彼求报此。
others reap their rewards.
恶事恶业，
Evil deeds and sinful actions—
此求报彼。
these bring retribution upon themselves.

一失人身，
A single loss of human form
便有此境。
brings such a fate.

至於酆都北帝启陈，
As for the **Northern Emperor of Yùndū**’s revelations,
尚云先缘不幸，
He still declares:
先缘不幸，
that past karmic connections were ill-fated,
身任冥司，
and one must serve the Netherworld’s officials,
动经亿劫，
through eons of toil,
不睹光明。
never seeing the light.

况其下鬼罪魂乎。
How much more so for lesser ghosts and sinful souls!

是以遵承太上慈训，
Thus, in accordance with the **Supreme Daoist Lord’s** compassionate teachings,
示此因缘，
to reveal these causes and effects,
使学士睹此苦报旨趣，
and let scholars behold the intent of these bitter retributions,
体太上慈悲之念，
grasp the **Supreme Lord’s** merciful intent,
发慈悲之智慧，
awaken compassionate wisdom,
行慈悲之法门，
practice the methods of compassion,
证慈悲之妙道，
realize the wondrous path of mercy,
使苦爽获慈悲之恩德，
so that suffering beings may receive the blessings of compassion,
岂不乐哉。
is this not joyous?

是故祖师起救苦度人之法门，
Therefore, the **Ancestral Master** established the **Method of Saving Suffering and Delivering Beings**,
百千万篇，
with countless scriptures,
作苦海之舟楫，
as vessels and oars for the sea of suffering,
为成真之径路。
providing the direct path to enlightenment.

凡是学士发斯慈心者，
All scholars who cultivate this compassionate heart
慎无旷慢。
must be vigilant and never negligent.

灵宝无量度人上经大法卷之五十一竟
**Scripture of the Supreme Daoist Lord’s Limitless Salvation of Beings—Chapter 51 of the Upper Canon** ends.

灵宝无量度人上经大法卷之五十二

**Chapter on Ascending Salvation Flags**

The **Imperial Sage** declared:
*"The rites of ascending salvation depend entirely on the **True Master’s** three fields of **qi**. By harmonizing with the **Heavenly Dao’s** three primal luminances—through incantations, talismans, and sacred diagrams—with **Dragon Script** and **Phoenix Seals**, one may appease the **Demonic Kings** and ascend to deliver beings in the **Southern Heaven**.

Yet if one’s devotion wavers even slightly, the departed will be trapped again in the **dark realms**, unable to awaken, unable to behold the radiance. This is deeply lamentable.

Thus, the **Ascending Salvation Rites** are established, that all **Daoist practitioners** may follow them faithfully. Then, the work of saving the dead and delivering the living shall be complete.

**Establishing the Two Flags for Transference and Return to the Yellow Realm**

These flags must be crafted according to the departed’s age, their length and breadth corresponding to years and months. One yellow, one red—to mirror the **symbols of sun and moon**.

Inscribe upon them the **hidden names of the Three Heavens**, and in the center, the **seals and incantations of the Nine Heavens**, placing them outside the altar to dispel the endless night’s darkness.

**Flag for Transference of the Spirit**

**Imperial Talisman and Incantation:**
*The **Heavenly Dao** is vast and profound, the **spirits of the unseen** ever-changing.
Wherever **Heaven and Earth** reach, hasten and obey this decree.*
**□** *covers the sky, swiftly shake the myriad spirits.*
**Imperial Command:** *Fly forth and ascend! Let the **suffering souls** depart in haste.*
*The right talisman is written in black upon white paper, sealed with the **Heavenly Sovereign’s** mark, using the **Jade Purity Incantation**. It is blown into water and sprinkled upon the **Soul-Collecting Altar**.*

**Flag for the Manifestation of the Spirit-Tiger Seal (also called the Seal of Silent Seclusion)**

*The incantation is the same as above; this talisman is written in red upon yellow paper and submerged in the **northern flowing waters**.*

**Method for the Daoist Master:**
*The Master himself recites one incantation, and for a departed soul within three years, he may burn the talisman to ash, hold it in his palm, and invoke:*
*'By the **Spirit-Tiger’s** might, I summon thee! The two talismans align with thy form. Hasten, as the decree commands!*

**Flag for Universal Manifestation of Messengers**

**Incantation:**
*The **Heavenly Dao** is vast and profound, the **spirits of the unseen** ever-changing.
The **Heavenly Emperor’s** command is given; hasten and obey.*
*The talisman is burned to ash, mixed with water, and sprinkled within and without the altar.*

**Incantation for the Messengers:**
*'The **Supreme Deity** commands: **Spirit-Tiger** and **Divine Generals**, guide the departed soul!
Swiftly convey them, that speech may pass without delay.
Hasten, as the decree commands!*

**Flag for Universal Vision and Manifestation**

The **Light-Flowing Flag**, the **Spirit-Light Permeating Flag**, the **Illuminating Salvation Jade Tablet Flag**, the **Swift-Sensing Radiance Flag**, the **Dragon-Awe Vajra-Salvation Flag**—these twenty-four flags are the **Primordial Sovereign of Heaven**’s teachings at the **Green Beginning Assembly**, where the **Ten Directions’ Ultimate Truths** each hold their **precious flags**, circling the **Sacred Altar** to honor the **Heavenly Sovereign** and deliver the souls of the **highest worlds**. In all great rituals, they must not be omitted.

The **Heavenly Sovereign of Three Refined Lights**, the **Heavenly Sovereign of Great Illuminating Radiance**, the **Heavenly Sovereign of Reversed Illumination**, the **Heavenly Sovereign of Stabilizing Treasure-Light**, the **Heavenly Sovereign of Vajra-Luminous Manifestation**, the **Heavenly Sovereign of Three Resplendent Lights**, the **Heavenly Sovereign of Light-Dao’s Guidance**, the **Heavenly Sovereign of Golden Light and Jade Brilliance**, the **Heavenly Sovereign of Universal Compassionate Radiance**.

**The Scripture of the Supreme Daoist Lord’s Ascending Salvation Flags**
**Opens the Sacred Dao**."

The **Jade Scripture’s** true writings are established to nurture the seed and eradicate extinction.
The **Lingbao’s** profound intent is the foundation for the **Dao’s** salvation and deliverance.

Thus, the **Divine Flags** are erected—these are the **Mysterious Treasures**.
They mark the **Taimi’s** revolving yellow script, bearing the **mysterious efficacy** of life and spirit.
Suspended high in the **Azure Void**, their shadows descend into the **Void of Nonbeing**.

A single firm pole pierces the endless night, rescuing the souls of the **Long Night**.
Through wondrous patterns, they propagate salvation, rescuing those trapped in **endless suffering**.
All the **Heavens** gather in unison, ten thousand **Saints** descend to the **Hall of Audience**—
their light illuminates the **Ten Directions**, their virtue returns to the **Three Treasures**.

**Next, the Sovereign of Soul-Saving Flags** is invoked:
The **Auspicious Clouds** weave the **Soul-Life Flags**, their shadows drift through the floating void into the world.
Light as mist, they ride the wind in a single ascent—
all living beings escape the **Dark Gates of Death**.

Now, in strict observance of the **Great Dao**, we solemnly establish the **Treasure Hall**.
The **Flags** dispel darkness, guiding all beings along the path.
The **Talismans** traverse the **Boundless Depths**, aligning with the **True Pattern of the Supreme Ultimate**.
Descending the **Three Radiant Lights**, we unfold the **Dao of the Most Authentic Truth**.
Already raised upon the single pole, they are seen by ten thousand eyes.
The **Auspicious Qi** drifts and ascends—
the **Six Paths** and **Four Births** all depart from suffering.
The **Spirit Wind** stirs—
the **Ten Directions** and **Three Realms** hear the sound.
All living and departed alike are universally encompassed,
each riding beneath the **Dao’s** shelter.

**Next, the Sovereign of Treasure-Standard Guidance** is invoked:
The **Immortal Worthies**, with compassionate aid, rescue all living beings,
raising the **Resplendent Flags** to pierce the **Dark Abyss**.
All are made to ascend their spirits to the **Azure Void**,
their blessings securing the **Pacified World** and eternal peace.

From ancient times, the **Dao’s** rites have been extolled—
erecting the **Treasure Flags**, following the **True Jade Repository’s** scriptures,
which are the **rites for delivering the dead and saving the living**.

Relying upon this **Supreme Virtue**, boundless benefits are bestowed,
assisting the **Divine Souls**, ascending to the **Immortal Realms**.
May the **Host of Worthies** swiftly guide them to the **Pure Abode**.
May all **Meritorious Beings** take pity, leading them to the **Southern Palace of the Celestial**.
May blessings touch both **Hidden** and **Manifest**—
compassion extends to all sentient beings,
all attaining the **Dao’s** shore.

**The Flag of Soul-Protection and Ascension**
**The Flag of Revolving Yellow Protection**

「The *Lingbao* Scripture of Boundless Salvation, Chapter 52, concludes.
The *Lingbao* Scripture of Boundless Salvation, Chapter 53, *The Chapter of Equal Compassion and Love*.

The Master says:
For those who earnestly seek the **Dao/Way**, practicing the *Lingbao* Great Law,
they must focus on the **Dao/Way** of delivering the **Hidden** and saving the living.

To attain its manifestation in the **sunlit** realm,
to communicate through words and visions,
or to appear in dreams in form,
this method is the **wondrous principle**.

All **Hidden souls** bound by grievances unresolved—
whether in **eternal enmity** or **endless karmic entanglements**,
whether **slaves or servants** who perish unjustly,
or **cast adrift** in vast seas,
or **lost for long** in dark nights,
or **imprisoned** in hells,
or **Dao-seekers** who fail and return to the **Hidden Realms**,
whether **monks** or **nuns**,
whether **merchants** or **traders**,
whether **mothers die** while sons live,
or **children perish** while mothers remain,
or **both mother and child** are lost,
or **self-hanged** to become malevolent,
or **executed unjustly** by royal decree,
or **travelers** who die from illness in distant lands,
or **those cursed** by pretense and **demonic afflictions**,
or **devoured by tigers**,
or **bitten by snakes**,
or **slain by objects**,
or **dying in water or fire disasters**,
or **fallen in battle**,
or **starved and frozen**, their families scattered,
or **murdered by burglars**,
whether **six realms’** beings or **ten types’** souls,
each has its own gate—
with them, I shall pursue and deliver.

Though the **Golden Talisman** may save lives,
there are **heaviness and lightness** of sins.

Thus, the **Supreme Dao/Way** examines the *Lingbao* treasures and the **Sacred Repository**,
issuing the **rites of salvation**—
knowing their **superintendents and attendants**,
they may be ascended and delivered.

By day, the **Great Law** establishes the **Eight Gates’** altar,
the **Yin** and **Yang** prisons,
the **Iron Tracks** and **Radiant Light** talismans—
all marking the **weight of crimes**.

Therefore, the **three altars** are set,
to reveal their **forms and traces**,
and deliver them accordingly—
each follows their **karmic retribution**,
manifesting in the **Eight Gates**.

Now, with the **Ascension and Salvation Talisman**,
I follow their **posthumous transgressions**,
and explain their **karmic pursuits**—
thus, they are spared confusion.

When using the talisman,
one must **examine it carefully**—
no room for **erroneous conjecture**.

becoming **enemies bound by karmic retribution**,
endlessly **repaying and receiving**—
no escape.

With this talisman, explain their **karmic entanglements**,
preventing them from sinking into **dark abysses**,
so they may **behold the light**,
and **harmony** their **grievances** into **friendship**.
Use **yellow paper**, six inches long,
**crimson script**, and the **Taoist Seal of the Tiger**.
The talisman’s incantation reads:
*The **Lingbao Talisman** commands,
explaining **karmic offenses**.
Abandoning evil, embracing virtue—
harmony and friendship, no **resentment**.

they preserve **heavenly years**.

unbinding, ascending to **Heaven**.
Swiftly, as the **Jade Clarity Heavenly Emperor** decrees.*

---
**The True Talisman for Summoning Officials to Retrieve the Posthumous Crimes of the Departed Soul**

The Master says:
When **departed souls** linger in the world,
committing crimes and evils—
whether **unfilial to the Six Kinsfolk**,
or **slandering the virtuous**,
or **multifarious misdeeds**,
their names are recorded in **Yin’s** halls,
their **crime ledgers** filed in **Hidden Realms**—
though grand **fasting rites** are held,
how can they **ascend and be delivered**?

They must **sincerely summon** the **Divine Officials**,
to retrieve the **departed soul’s** **past-life crime ledgers**,
and present them before the **Supreme Dao/Way’s** throne,
explaining their **karmic offenses**,
erasing their **black crime records**,

Use **yellow paper**, seven inches long,
**crimson script**, and the **Taoist Seal of the Emperor’s Decree**.
The talisman’s incantation reads:

delivered to the **Hidden Capital**.
Retrieving their **crime ledgers**,

registering them in **Virtue’s Book**.

Swiftly, as the **Jade Clarity Heavenly Emperor** decrees.*

**The Talisman for Pursuing Servants Wrongfully Killed by Drowning**
Yellow paper, five inches long, two inches wide, inscribed in vermilion.
**Incantation:**
By the Jade Purity Supreme Decree,
I command the talisman:
*"Jade Purity Treasure of the Dao,*
*Pursue and guide the wrongfully drowned souls.*
*Open the gates of the endless night court,*
*Ascend and deliver them from the Nine Underworlds’ depths.*
*This true talisman releases their endless feuds,*
*Harmonizes their way, freeing them from darkness.*
*Swiftly, as the Jade Purity Supreme Decrees."*

The Master says:
Among mortals who seek justice at the altar,
whether they be merchants lost at sea,
or those wrongfully accused of male or female identity,
who perish in the waves of great rivers and oceans—
where do their bodies drift?
Scattered across distant lands,
they remember not their time of death,
and have no path to pursue deliverance.

With this talisman, command their return,
and further affix it to the *Shenhu* (神虎) retinue,
as well as the *Xúnfǎng Jiécí Shǐzhě* (寻访捷疾使者, Swift Messengers of Search and Inquiry),
to pursue and summon them to the altar,
reveal their forms and traces,
unblock their karmic entanglements,
and grant them ascension.

Yellow paper, seven inches long, inscribed in vermilion.
**Incantation:**
By the Jade Purity Supreme Decrees,
I command the talisman:
*"Jade Purity Treasure of the Dao,*
*Pursue and guide the souls wrongfully slain in prison.*
*Open the gates of the endless night court,*
*Ascend and deliver them from the Nine Underworlds’ depths.*
*This true talisman releases their endless feuds,*
*Harmonizes their way, freeing them from darkness.*
*Swiftly, as the Jade Purity Supreme Decrees."*

The Master says:
Those who wish to pursue the souls of the wrongfully slain
must first deliver the souls imprisoned in the Underworld’s courts,
who have committed crimes and died,
entangled in the prisons of darkness,
cycle after cycle, life after life,
endlessly repaying their karmic debts,
trapped in the courts of darkness with no hope of release.

Use this true talisman,
proclaim its power for ascension,
by the Jade Purity Supreme Decree.
**Soft Talisman Incantation:**
By the Jade Purity Edict,
I ascend and deliver to the Underworld’s halls.
All imprisoned souls in the courts of darkness
shall each be released and dissolved like ice.
Their grudges follow virtuous thoughts,
their karmic retributions are lightened.
The Merciful Sovereign saves suffering,
the blade is consumed, the gate unlocked.
Swiftly, as the Jade Purity Supreme Decrees.

**The Talisman for Pursuing Souls of Those Who Died Prematurely from Dao Practice**
Yellow paper, five inches long, two inches wide with an additional one-tenth inch, inscribed in vermilion, by the Jade Purity Supreme Decree.
**Incantation:**
*"Jade Purity Treasure of the Dao,*
*Descend to the Underworld’s gates.*
*Crush the Earthly Prison,*
*Open the Iron City’s decrees.*
*For the untrained who died prematurely,*
*Command their essence to remain whole.*
*By this talisman’s power,*
*Return them twice to human and celestial realms.*
*If they refine their hearts without retreat,*
*They shall ascend to Dao’s completion.*
*Swiftly, as the Jade Purity Merciful Sovereign’s Decrees."*

The Master says:
Those who became monks, Daoists, or nuns
yet failed to meet their teacher’s will,
and thus could not grasp the essential methods of cultivation,
suddenly entering the Underworld’s courts—
this too is a wrongful debt,
how much more so if they seek rebirth without retribution.
To refine the heart and escape the Wheel of Rebirth,
await the Merciful Sovereign’s ascension beyond the Three Realms—
all such matters arise from the heart’s own making,
and are self-inflicted.

Since they have already entered the Underworld’s courts,
they must each bear their karmic burdens.
Thus, establish the Eight-Gate Altar,
open the doors of release and deliverance,
perform the *Chāohù Húnyí* (超户魂仪, Ascension Ritual for Imprisoned Souls),
augment their Daoist merit,
and use this true talisman
to immediately grant their ascension.

Yellow paper, seven inches long, two inches wide with an additional two-tenths inches, inscribed in vermilion.
**Incantation:**
*"Treasure of the Dao’s sacred script,*
*Transmigrate and elevate the merciful souls.*
*Descend to the Underworld’s gates,*
*Ascend the ritual spirits.*
*Unbind their karmic debts,*
*Dispel the demonic host.*
*Merciful souls ascend,*
*Their essence refined in crimson.*
*They return to the Great Yang,*
*Dao and virtue naturally born.*
*Swiftly, as the Jade Purity Celestial Sovereign’s Decrees."*

**The Talismans for Pursuing Souls Lost in Childbirth**
The Master says:
Among mortals born into this world,
women bear the greatest sorrow—
for they are bound by past karmic debts,
taken as brides into foreign households,
where *yin* and *yang* forces gather,
forming the embryo.
Thus, childbirth brings countless hardships.

Sometimes the mother dies while the child lives,
sometimes the child dies while the mother lives,
sometimes both mother and child perish,
or even when still unborn—
the child remains in the womb while both die together.

All such souls are entangled by past-life grudges,
endlessly repaying debts,
silent in the Underworld’s endless night,
crying out in the depths of darkness—
*"Hóu! Hóu!"*—
their suffering unbearable,
no path to liberation,
their bodies stained with blood, foul and reeking before Heaven.
How then can they be released?

If practitioners act without understanding,
merely reciting formulas for ascension,
they struggle to evoke response,
and deliverance is unattainable.

Thus, use these talismans
to summon them from the *Xuěhú Yù* (血湖狱, Blood Lake Prison),
commanding their return to the altar,
cleansing their forms,
preserving their bodies intact,
so that their shapes and essences are whole,
and they may ascend the Heavenly Path,
finding natural joy.

**The Talisman for Pursuing the Child’s Soul When the Mother Lives**
**The Talisman for Pursuing Both Mother and Child’s Souls When They Die Together**
**The Talisman for Pursuing the Child’s Soul When Still Unborn and Both Perish**
**Incantation for All Childbirth Talismans:**
*"By the Jade Purity’s sacred script,*
*Ascend and deliver the souls lost in childbirth.*
*Extract them from the endless night’s prison,*
*Transcend the gates of rebirth.*
*Unbind their past-life karmic debts,*
*Sever their accumulated sins.*
*Riding this talisman to the Crimson Court,*
*They undergo refinement, transformed into humans.*
*Swiftly, as the Jade Purity Supreme Decrees."*

The Master says:
All who die in childbirth
have past-life grudges that harm them.
Even in this life,
each debt must be repaid—
silent in the Underworld’s night,
crying out in the depths of darkness—
*"Hóu! Hóu!"*—
their suffering unbearable,
no path to liberation,
their bodies stained with blood, foul and reeking before Heaven.
How then can they be released?

Within the Underworld,
there is a prison at the bottom of the Northern Yin Sea,
named the *Blood Lake Prison*.
Such souls are all confined there.
There is a divine overseer,
called the *Great God of Blood Lake*,
dwelling beneath the *Wújí Water* (无极水),
where the currents flow above,
and the stench reaches the heavens.
Now, practitioners and masters alike
do not know their true affiliations,
and merely summon the *Shenhu* (神虎) retinue to pursue them.
How can they arrive?
If the gods see them,
they too must be defiled,
and cannot approach.

But if one invokes the **Great God of Blood Lake**,
let the divine officials—along with the *Shenhu* (神虎) retinue—
escort them to the base of the *Blood Lake Prison*,
then still must petition the **Heavenly Physician of the Great Void** (斗下天医君),
with the full likeness,
before they may pursue and summon the guilty to the altar.

Practitioners of the **Dao** (道) should proceed with caution.

**Summoning the Souls of Those Who Died by Breaking the King’s Law**
The Master says:
*"All mortals are foolish and deluded,
unaware of the King’s Law’s existence,
using their hearts recklessly,
slaying others and harming life.
Some fight and quarrel,
one as an old adversary,
the other as a grudge-bound tormentor.
Though their rage may be fleeting in the moment,
how could they know they forfeit their own lives?
Their souls guard the battlefield,
their spirits await their turn as adversaries.
In this life, they suffer repayment,
and in the next, the torment continues—
pair by pair, endlessly entangled,
with no respite in sight.

How then can such souls be released?
Even if they ascend by the **White Register** (白简),
the roots of their crimes cannot be avoided.
This sacred talisman should be used for their absolution.

The talisman should be inscribed on yellow paper,
with vermilion text,
five inches long and two inches wide.

*"All mortals in this world—

「The Mystic Master speaks: In the Three Heavens, there is the peerless luminous *True Treasure* of the Golden *Dao* and Jade Tablets, the *True Seal* of Rescue from Suffering. The Jade Strategy states: *"The Eastern Extremity, the Azure Palace of Nine Dragons, the Golden Dao Seal of Rescue from Suffering."*

This is the威章 (*Weizhang*) of *Yuan Shi* and the曲恩 (*Quen*) of the Celestial Sovereign. It is truly the法药 (*Faoyao*)—the remedy for those ensnared in darkness, a decree as urgent as the command itself, allowing one to traverse the太虚 (*Taihu*, Great Void).

**Right: The Spell for Horizontally Slain Suffering Souls**
*Imperial Truth* is blended and refined, the spirit is tempered and the vital essence is nourished. Left and right officials comply with the order, the *Sima* (司马) of the *Dongyao* (洞谣) responds. Nine nights of submerged souls dissolve, and malignant roots are transformed. The *Zihu* (紫户) seals the records, and the *Shenfu* (神府) ascends to the *Xiao* (霄). The long night is opened, and the *yin* (阴) aligns with the *yang* (阳) standard. The Three *Zhang* (章) are unified under the sovereign’s rule, bringing harmony to the *afu* (幽寥) and the Six *Qi* (炁) all obey. The *Sima* (司命), *Silu* (司录), *Sigong* (司功), and *Sisha* (司杀) oversee the Three Sovereigns and reveal the *Dufu* (都府).

The *Zhongli* (中理) of the Five *Qi* (炁) blends harmoniously with the hundred spirits. The *Tan* (昙) chant extends beyond, receiving the decree from the Three *Qing* (清). The Nine *Yang* (阳) govern transformation, nurturing souls beneath the clouds. The *Daming* (大明) unites with the sun, obtaining the *Tianjing* (天晶) of celestial brilliance. The radiant Jade Sovereign ascends, and the Nine Abysses all rise together. The *Quanqu* (泉曲) receive the decree, and the abyssal souls are pardoned by imperial edict. As swift as the *Qingxuan* (青玄) laws, this is the decree.

**Right: The Spell for Souls Lost in Childbirth**
The three souls return to their *Ying* (英), and the *lüzì* (绿字) souls are reborn. The nine orifices are opened, and the five seals welcome the spirit. The gates of the ghosts are severed, and the *Huangdao* (皇道) is made clear. The Three *Tai* (台) are spread with brilliance, and the Six *Yi* (仪) are blended into unity. *Yin* and *yang* are harmonized, and the *Huangda* (皇达) unites with the *Yuanling* (元灵). The Five Sovereigns and Great Demons serve as attendants, escorting and welcoming. The *Hunben* (混本) returns to *Yiyī* (一), ascending the Three *Qing* (清). The Nine Clans are all liberated, and the Three *Jing* (景) are pure. My body is liberated from this realm, and my essence merges with nature. My living form receives the decree, and thus I endure through countless *jia* (劫). The Nine Abysses cannot contain me, nor can the *Youguo* (幽廓) restrain me. I reflect upon the *Huanghe* (皇河), and gallop through the *Yu Xu* (玉虚).

**Right: The Spell for the Long-Living Seal, Dissolving the Vital Orifices**
The *True Treasure* of Rescue from Suffering is invoked as follows:
*The Most High Dual-Luminous* (俩明), *Yuan Shi* the Illuminating Sovereign (元始明真). The Five Elders and Celestial Sovereigns (五老上帝), with their *Chishu* (赤书) and Jade Texts (玉文), extract and remove sins and malignant roots. All are granted liberation, and the scrutiny and punishment cease. The soul ascends to the Nine Heavens, and the spirit crosses the *Zhuling* (朱陵). Today, I make my report to the heights, and all spirits hear it. As swift as a *Tongming* (告命) decree, transmitted by wind and fire.

**The Long-Living Seal Chant**
*Yuan Shi* the Celestial Sovereign (元始上帝), with *Chishu* (赤书) and Jade Texts (玉文), dissolves and consumes *yin* obstructions. By refining fire, one attains true essence. The blade is sharp at the *Nanji* (南极), and the *Fuyan* (浮阎) spirits are summoned to the divine court. The essence of fire is refined and flows, and the *Chan You* (禅猷) preserves life. The *Poni* (婆尼) True Child (真童) cleanses the defilements within. The inner and outer are radiant, revealing the form of the Jade Infant (玉婴). Ascending the *Chanli* (禅黎), one enters the *Dongyang* (洞阳) court. As swift as a *Tongming* (告命) decree, transmitted by wind and fire.

**The Dispatch of the True Seal of Rescue from Suffering**
When invoking the seal, chant over the incense:
*The Most High Dual-Luminous* (俩明), *Yu Di* the High Spirit (玉帝高灵). The Jade Texts report the decree, saving the dead and granting rebirth. The Golden *Dao* Seal’s wondrous precepts rescue and protect the abyssal realms. The White Tablet and Precious Seal are the *Jiuzhen* (九真) *Xuanjing* (玄经). They dissolve and extinguish sins and debts, and grievances are pacified. The *True Person* of Rescue from Suffering removes punishments. The *Cha Ming* (察命) Child records names for rebirth. The *Huojie* (护戒) Spirits guide them to the *Futing* (福庭). Beyond the Five Sufferings, they ride the cloud palanquin. The *Zhuanlun* (转轮) attain the *Dao*, and ascend to the *Shangqing* (上清). This is the dispatch of the Long-Living Seal.

**The Decree of the Long-Living Seal**
The *Huangren* (皇人) says: *"The souls bound by sin are under the jurisdiction of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Elements (北斗七元). Therefore, first inscribe the characters of the peerless Seven Elements and the Nine Abysses’ sinful souls (九幽罪魂之字), then apply the *qi* (炁) of the Three Lights (三光) to illuminate the Ten Directions (十方), and the Three *Tai* (台) shine brightly. Hence, inscribe the light of the *Xuanxiang* (玄象) to illuminate the Eight Prisons and Five Prisons (八狱五狱), the Five Sovereigns overseeing life (五帝监生), and the Six Spirits (六神) animating the souls (运灵). Next, inscribe the light of the *Hedai* (合日), which the Three Lights illuminate. The *Zifu* (紫府) marks the names, the Celestial Lords hold the seals, and the decree is proclaimed in the *Huating* (华庭). The *qi* (炁) of *Tianshui* (天元) and *Taimian* (太山) nourish the Southern Dipper (南斗). The Three Officials (三官) receive the edict, and beneath the Nine Earths (九地), within the Nine Waters (九水), and across the Nine *Yin* (阴) landscapes (九阴之景), all witness the radiance."*

**The Decree of the True Seal of Rescue from Suffering**
*The Huangren* (皇人) says: *"When humans fall into ruin, it is due to the control of the Three Corpses and Nine Vermin (三尸九虫). All are subject to the movements of the Five Phases (五行), thus entering the gates of the Five Sufferings (五苦) and the cycle of rebirth (轮回). Therefore, the *Taiyi* (太一) first employs the *qi* (炁) of the Three Lights (三炁) to shatter the Nine Abysses’ prisons (九幽之狱). Inscribe the *qi* (炁) of the Nine Stars (九星) to purge the corpses and defilements, making the Five Viscera (五藏) internally luminous. As swift as the sun’s movement, the *yin* and *yang* return to their souls and spirits (魂魄). Hence, inscribe the *qi* (炁) of the *Dian Shi* (砀尸) and *Yan You* (演由), then arrange the Eight Trigrams’ stars (八卦之星), the *Xuanxiang* (玄象) manifesting their forms, the Two *Yi* (仪) harmonizing, and the Three *Qi* (炁) flowing to subdue the Three *Tian* (田). The Heart rules *Kan* (坎) and *Li* (离), ascending to the court of the Three *Qing* (清). Then, array the True *Qi* (炁) to fill and overflow, and all spirits respectfully listen. The Nine Abysses are destroyed, blending into One *Qi* (炁), the corpses return and life is reborn—hence, inscribe the 曲赦 (*Qushè*, "curved pardon").*

**The True Precepts for Practice and Use**
Carefully following the *Jiuyou Bazui Zhenjing* (九幽拔罪真经), the Northern Sovereign (北帝) once widely proclaimed the request for rescue, extracting all sufferings. The *Xu Huang* (虚皇) Celestial Sovereign, with golden mouth, spoke to the Four Assemblies (四众). Now I proclaim to you the Nine True Precepts (九真妙戒), the Golden *Dao* Seal (金箓) and White Tablets (白简), the True Seal of Rescue from Suffering (救苦真符), and the Long-Living Seal (长生灵符). By receiving and upholding these, you gain merit, extract difficulties, and rescue suffering—spiritual power beyond measure. All spirits bow in reverence, receiving the teachings and the *Xu Huang* (虚皇) Celestial Sovereign’s benevolent pardon (天尊宸泽曲赦).

Now, for the establishment of the *Huangji* (黄箓) Great Fast (大斋), you must use the *Qingzhang* (青章) and *Huangbiao* (黄表), presenting them to the *Xu Huang* (虚皇) Celestial Sovereign’s presence.»

Then one may proclaim to the Ten Directions of the Boundless World, rescuing and extracting all sufferings. If the petitions are not properly presented, merely establishing the fast in vain yields little spiritual efficacy.

Together with the *Succhāra* (素车) and *Baima* (白马) petitions, the *Shangqing* (上清) *Taixuan* (太玄) True Seal, bearing the *Taixuan* (太玄) Seal Command, is sent to the Ten Directions to open pathways and rescue lost souls—this is the harmonious accord of heaven and humanity, the model of celestial and human law.

The *Huangji* (黄箓) Nine-Yin Great Fast is not to be taken lightly. Moreover, the chief officiant and high-ranking priests, whose daily virtues are outweighed by transgressions and whose conduct is thin in virtue, have their crimes recorded in the Northern Bureau, their spirits confined within shackles—how could they rescue lost souls from the underworld?

Merely arranging food for the altar and decorating the platform risks profaning the lofty immortals. If, at the outset of the Great Fast, the officiating Daoists and the Six Officials of the Law first adhere to the Nine True Precepts, receive the *Nanchang* (南昌) *Lianzhi* (炼质) Soul-Seal of Long Life to refine the yin with the yang, their sins may also be absolved. On the day of dismantling the altar, they must return the precepts and seals. If they do not uphold the precepts or bear the seals, their fast will be in vain, and no response will be granted.

The two seals of *Tiāolóng* (茭龙) and *Yìlì* (驿吏) accompany the petition, ascending to *Xuandu* (玄都), detailing the number of the deceased and requesting the descent of true officials to transmit the seals.

When inscribing these two seals, use light yellow and light green as the base, writing with *cinnabar* (丹砂). Burn incense, face north toward the *Beidou* (北斗) constellation, aligning with the *Taizun* (太尊) and *Tianhuang* (天皇) Jewel Stars. Recite the *Yùqīng* (玉清) incantation, then complete the inscription and blow *qi* into the seals. Thus, they may be transmitted to the underworld to absolve the sins of the deceased—none will fail to respond.

The *Jiu’ku* (救苦) Seal of Long Life should be inscribed on *bùmù* (栢木) tablets. For the *Congxiang* (丛相) Celestial Sovereign, heaven bestows sacred *qi*, nurturing eternal life. Human longevity is governed by the Three *Yuan* (三元), and among the Nine Earths, this wood is the most refined—comparable to gold and jade in its protective *qi*. Among all woods, *chun* (椿) is the Wood Sovereign. Wherever houses or wooden structures gather, if they attract malevolent *qi*, using *chun* wood for beams and pillars will dispel the evil.

Using *bùmù* as the tablet, it absorbs the pure *qi* of heaven and embodies eternal life. The spiritual officials revere its golden-wood essence, and the underworld values its capacity for rebirth. Hence, ancient coffins were made of *bùmù* to avoid the tortures of the Three Realms. The *Xu Huang* (虚皇) Sacred Seal states: "Using *bùmù* tablets is equivalent to gold and jade."

Many in the world use *zǐmù* (梓木), however, which is a wood of *sha* (煞) *qi*—unable to nurture life unless properly aligned, violating the precepts of the Sacred Scripture. Its use is forever prohibited.

The tablet should be nine inches long—symbolizing the Nine Heavens and Nine Yang, emerging from the Nine Yin of the deep abyss, ascending to heaven on the Nine Yang *qi*. Its width should be two inches and four *fen*—representing the Three Realms and Eight Sceneries, encompassing the *qi* of the Twenty-Four Divine Spirits. Its thickness should be two *fen*—emblematic of the harmonious union of yin and yang, embodying the singular transformation of heaven and earth.

Seal it in a green pouch, a color revered by the Three Officials as the beginning of purity. Burn it in green smoke alone, without mixing other fumes that might corrupt the pure *qi*. During the fast, after purifying with incense, use nine-times-refined *cinnabar* to inscribe the seals facing east, before the Three Treasures, according to the prescribed rites—only then will the seals align properly.

In recent times, many practitioners ignorant of ancient rites merely print seals on yellow paper and affix them to boards. The *Shangqing* (上清) Lord, pitying the souls submerged in the depths of darkness, fears that improper seals may hinder their transcendence. He specially dispatches the Spirit Officials to admonish: "The *Huangji* (黄箓) Nine-Yin Fast is no different from the Northern Yin—it relies entirely on the two True Seals. If one uses printed paper seals instead, the high crimes will befall the practitioners themselves. Moreover, if the inscriptions are careless, the seals improperly inscribed, deviating from the law, the underworld officials will refuse to use them—heed this warning carefully."

The *Yùcè* (玉策) states: All beings inherit the primordial *Taiyuan* (太元), their pure spiritual source. Though they borrow *qi* from matter and receive divine essence in form, fortunate are those who glimpse the celestial radiance, yet they fail to honor it. *Qi* clings to objects, giving rise to mundane desires, while spirits and demons scheme, their efforts daily diminishing. As *qi* erodes and the spirit fades, they cannot return to their origin. Entangled in the Five Bonds, they suffer in the underworld—some in the Five Mountains and great rivers, the Nine-Yin prefectures, the city gods and community deities, or the springs and sources of rivers. Others rely on orphaned spirits, cling to malevolent objects, wander dark paths, conspire with shamans to stir mischief, clinging to deluded minds and unaware of their past lives. When confronted with virtuous influences, their forms shift and their spirits wander, their hearts and forms inseparable, trapped in an endless cycle. The lofty path of humanity is thus exhausted.

The Most High, in boundless compassion, always rescues all beings, issuing seals to the underworld to benefit the lost, extinguishing the flames of suffering, absolving the burdens of past lives. The celestial waves flow deeply, refining and returning them to humanity. It is further said: For those who universally benefit the Nine-Yin orphaned spirits, the countless descendants across eons, conducting grand rituals to heaven and earth and submitting to the *Xuanzhen* (玄真), the officiant must first announce to the Three Realms, report to the *Xuanshi* (玄师), and inform the earthly officials.

Next, establish the *Huangji* (黄箓) Great Fast, presenting the ritual thanksgiving offerings. When inscribing the seals, enter the *Jìng* (靖) incantation, burn incense, and announce to the Three Realms, facing northeast. Write the *Jiùkǔ Zhēnsù* (救苦真符) on a *bùmù* tablet with red seals, inscribing the *Yuānshǐ Fùmìng* (元始符命) on the reverse, and seal it in a green pouch.

List the rank of the chief officiant and command the *Tiāolóng* (茭龙) and *Yìlì* (驿吏) to swiftly proclaim to the Ten Directions of the Boundless World, declaring the Five Agents. The old texts mention six agents—this corresponds to the *Jiǎshēn* (甲申) era of the *Shànghuáng* (上皇) reign, as seen in today’s inscriptions of the *Jiǎzǐ* (甲子) year.

Now, the revised text includes the year, month, and day as the sixth agent, using celestial seals and the *Yùqì* (阙支) stems and branches. Yet, to avoid mixing worldly script with the true brushwork, one may instead transfer the year and month declaration to the reverse of the tablet.

The *Jiùkǔ Zhēnsù* (救苦真符) is sealed in green paper, with the *Yuānshǐ Fùmìng* (元始符命) inscribed upon its reverse, and proclaimed to the Ten Directions of the Boundless World below, rendering two lines above the tablet’s clasp.

Then, summon the *Tiāolóng* (茭龙) and *Yìlì* (驿吏), together with gold coins to paint the dragon, and burn them in fierce flames.

The *Yùcè* (玉策) states: According to *Zhēn Gāo* (真诰), the *Zǐwēi Wáng Fūrén* (紫微王夫人) replied to *Yáng Sīmìng* (杨司命) in a written discourse: *"Permit me to explain the origin of this scripture: as with the Three Elements and Eight Assemblies, it is the imperial sovereign’s use of the Supreme Polarity, High True, and Pure Celestial Dao. The seals bear the luminous characters of the divine scriptures, which are the very letters seen in the sacred inscriptions of the gods today. In the age of the *Huá Jì* (华季), they falsely crafted intricate and vulgar strokes, descending to crude and profane characters. Abandoning the original for the counterfeit, this is but the filth of deceit and death. How could the True Celestial ones forsake the authentic, virtuous script and instead hand-paint the profane and chaotic characters below?"*

Now, within the *Chángshēng Fú* (长生符) are forty-seven characters; together with the two seals’ proclamations, the old texts all state that these are the luminous characters of the divine seals. Later generations, unaware of the distinction between true and mundane scriptures, simply substituted the worldly characters in their place. How could this not sully the sublime and refined sacred texts, and fail to observe the forbidden norms below?

The *Yùcè* (玉策) further declares: The *Tiāolóng* (茭龙) and *Yìlì* (驿吏) should respond to the command, meaning that one should not rely on written charms but instead transmit the seals directly.

For those who have yet to move the Mysterious Spirits (玄灵), one may draft a *Qǐngguān* (请关) petition. Seal the *Yìlì* (驿吏) talisman at the end of the petition, so that the command may reach the *Hán Sī* (寒司) officials.

Alternatively, one may take fresh *tiāo* (茭) reeds, bind them to a *Xiànglóng* (象龙) and *Xiàngyì* (象吏) effigy, and place the talisman within it, instructing them to carry the inscribed tablet. A separate petition must also be composed, addressing the *Tíng Dōu* (酆都) officials, and it is imperative to inform the Supreme Mysteries (上玄) of this.

If the *Yìlì* (驿吏) are not summoned, and one merely acts upon private intent, hastily proclaiming this talisman without proper authority, it is akin to the mortal world’s arbitrary pardons—something no subject dares to unilaterally decree. Thus, a grand *Chéngdiào* (醮) ceremony for Heaven and Earth must be conducted before this talisman may be used.

The *Xuānshī* (玄师) says: In the Thirty-two Heavens (三十二天), there are *Fēilóng Qíshǐ* (飞龙骑史), and in the *Xuāndū* (玄都), there are *Yìlóng Qíshǐ* (驿龙骑史). Hence, the scriptures say: *"The golden Tiāolóng (金龙驿呈) presents itself, receiving the divine proclamation."* Some ride upon the *Tiānmǎ* (天马), others upon the *Tiānjiāo* (天蛟), or harness the *Jīnlóng Jīnmǎ* (金龙金马) to proclaim to the Three Realms and Ten Directions, covering all in an instant.

The *Tiāolóng Yìlì* (茭龙驿吏) talisman: The *Xuānshī* (玄师) further states: In the *Tàixuān Dū* (泰玄都), there are twelve hundred thousand *Tiāolóng Yìlì* (茭龙驿吏) who oversee the transmission of commands and the opening of luminous pardons for offenses. When proclaiming the *Jiùkǔ Zhēnsù* (救苦真符), one must first inform the *Yùzūn Yùdì* (玉尊玉帝), then summon one of these officials.

At the time of inscribing the talisman, recite the *Yùdì Jié* (玉帝诀) while the *Bíyǐn Shī* (鼻引师) guides the *Qi* (炁) and *Máng* (芒) through nasal inhalation and oral exhalation. The *Qi* (炁) of the Five Stars and Three Luminaries (三光五星) should be drawn in through the nose and expelled through the mouth. The *Qi* (炁) of life and vigor, manifesting as clouds and mist, should be inhaled through the mouth and exhaled as directed. When inhaling and exhaling, ensure that the ears remain closed. If the ears hear, the *Qi* (炁) and *Máng* (芒) will not descend. One must also avoid prolonged inhalation, lest the breathing rhythm be disrupted. The key lies in concentrating one’s thoughts, controlling the *Qi* (炁), and harmonizing with the spirit. Within the dim and distant realms, the inhalation and exhalation will naturally align with the focused mind.

The light of the *Běijí* (北极) Star: This is not the sixth star, *Wǔqū* (武曲), within the *Dòu* (斗) constellation, but rather the *Tiānhuáng* (天皇)’s right *Běijí* (北极) star, *Tiāngǔ* (天枢). The strokes should encircle the seal, with yellow ink upon yellow paper dyed with light *Huáihuā* (槐花) hue.

During meditation, burn the talisman and summon the *Yìlì* (驿吏) to present it before the *Tiāolóng* (茭龙), placing the talisman within their body.

To the right, summon one **Xuan Du** (玄都) **Jiao Long** (交龙) courier official to fast and attend the **Yuan Shi** (元始) **Fu Ming** (符命) *Saviour of Suffering True Talisman*, illuminating and pardoning sins, just as the decree commands.

If the talisman is to be used first, then employ this rightward invocation. If only affixed to the *Guanzi* (关子) seal, no invocation is needed.

**Guan Shi** (关式) **Tantán** (坛额):
*"Now, in accordance with the **Yuan Shi Fu Ming Saviour of Suffering True Talisman**, to rescue and elevate the soul of [name], freeing it from the dark night."*

To the right, summon one **Guan** (关) **Jiao Long** (茭龙) courier official to fast and bear the **Fu Ming** (符命), swiftly delivering it to **Luoping** (罗酆), rescuing and elevating the departed soul, and revealing it to the **Chen Ji** (宸肌).

Year: ___ Month: ___ Day: ___ Hour: ___ **Guan** (关) seal.

Position: ___ Surname: ___ Name: ___ Seal.

**Jin Long** (金龙) **Yi Shi** (驿吏) **Fu** (符):
The **Xuan Shi** (玄师) says: *"In the **Tai Xuan Du** (泰玄都), there are 250,000 **Jin Long** (金龙) courier officials, overseeing the delivery of talismans and decrees, and conveying messages across the **Mo Tian Dao** (魔天道).*

For all **Longsheng** (长生) *True Talismans of Eternal Life*, one courier is assigned per decree. Write in red ink on blue paper, invoking the **Yu Huang Jue** (玉皇诀), and draw in the *Mang* (芒) of the **Tai Zun** (太尊) Star through the nose. Face south and north, gazing upon the **Tai Zun** Star, which lies within the *Dou Tou* (斗头), below the *Tai Fen* (台分), slightly angled north.

The **Tai Zun** (太尊) has four stars to its north, arrayed like a military well. To its south lies **Shao Wei** (少微), resembling the *Kang Su* (亢宿) constellation. The **Tai Zun** itself is yellow and luminous—know that it lies south of the *Huan Ji* (环玑) and *Er* (二) stars of the **Bei Dou** (北斗).

Write in encircling strokes, then burn and invoke as before. To draw the *Mang* (芒) of the **Tai Zun** and **Bei Ji** (北极) stars, wait until nightfall when the stars are clear, for only then shall their essence be true."

To the right, summon one **Xuan Du** (玄都) **Jin Long** (金龙) courier official to bear the **Yuan Shi Fu Ming** (元始符命) *Eternal Life Spirit Talisman*, to elevate the departed soul of [name], guiding them to the **Nan Gong** (南宫), just as the decree commands.

**Guan Shi** (关式) **Tantán** (坛额).

「Now, in accordance with the **Yuan Shi Fu Ming** (元始符命) and **Chángshēng Língfú** (长生灵符), we elevate the soul of **[Name]** to the **Zhū Gōng** (朱宫, Vermilion Palace).

To the right, summon one **Xuan Du** (玄都) **Jin Long** (金龙) courier official to bear the **Fú Mìng** (符命), directly reaching the **Nán Tiān** (南天, Southern Heaven), elevating the departed soul as commanded. The year, month, day, and hour are recorded here as **[Year] [Month] [Day] [Time]**.

**[Name]**, of **[Title/Rank]**, seals this with their signature.

To the right, the two **Shǐ** (史, officials) under **Tiān Yóu** (天猷) command: if they wish to petition for descent, let them first state their intentions. During the **Zhōngyuán Jǐngdān** (中元景丹, Mid-Autumn Festival of the Vermilion Lantern), the **Tiānfǔ** (天府, Celestial Treasury) can also apply to the **Sìshèng** (四圣, Four Celestial Saints) for aid.

For **Tiān Pēng** (天蓬, Celestial Phoenix) governs the retrieval of souls, and **Yòushèng Cháng** (佑圣常, Constantly Aiding Sage) rescues those lost in suffering.

**Qiè Lóng** (茭龙) incantation bearing the talisman:
*"Earthly Treasury **Qiè Lóng** (茭龙), Saviour of Suffering—True Talisman (救苦真符).
Pursue and reclaim the lost soul, swiftly depart from **Chēngdū** (酆都, Netherworld Capital).
Come to pay homage to the **Tàishàng** (太上, Supreme Sage), ascending to the **Tiāngōng** (天宫, Celestial Palace).
Hasten as per the edicts of the **Yùqīng Dìshì** (玉清帝, Jade Purity Sovereign)."*

**Jin Long** (金龙) incantation bearing the talisman:
*"Fire Treasury **Jin Lóng** (金龙), Eternal Life—True Talisman (长生灵符).
Elevate those in suffering, swiftly depart from **Yōudū** (幽都, Dark Realm).
Behold the radiance, ascend to **Nán Gōng** (南宫, Southern Palace).
Hasten as per the edicts of the **Yùqīng Dìshì** (玉清帝, Jade Purity Sovereign)."*

**Clarification on the Bearer:**
The **Lóngtóng** (龙童, Dragon Boy) is mistakenly depicted as a child, yet the **Lónglì** (龙吏, Dragon Official) resembles a **Lìshì** (力士, Celestial Warrior). As the scriptures state:
*"For those who have passed, if they receive and uphold the **Jīn Luó Bái Jiǎn** (金箓白简, Golden Sutra and White Tablets), the **Jiǔzhēn Miàojiè** (九真妙戒, Nine True Precious Vows), the **Chángshēng Língfú** (长生灵符), the **Jiùkǔ Zhēnfú** (救苦真符), the **Chámìng Tóngzǐ** (察命童子, Inspecting Fate Boy), the **Hùjiè Wēishén** (护戒威神, Venerable Guardian of Vows), the **Wǔdì Zhífú** (五帝直符, Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors), and the **Liùguān Yuànshì** (六官掾史, Six Officials of the Celestial Bureau), they shall naturally follow the tablets and protect those who receive the vows.
Thus, it is known that the **Lóngtóng** (龙童) should not bear the tablets—this is a lost tradition in transmission."*

**Scripture of *Língbǎo Wúliàng Dùrén* (灵宝无量度人) Upper Canon, Chapter Fifty-Five concluded.

**Universal Salvation Talismans – The Supreme Sovereign’s *Shēngtiān Bǎojù* (生天宝箓)**
The **Xuan Shi** (玄师) speaks:

Above the Nine Pure Ones stands the **Supreme Great Luo**—the **Yujing Golden Gate**—where the **Alliance of the Perfected** is enshrined in secret within the **Jade Repository**. This is the **Lingbao** method for universally salvaging the netherworld.

Since the **Chiming** opened its diagrams, the **Yuan Shi**—the **Supreme Emperor**—declared the **sacred scriptures of deliverance from suffering and expiation of crimes**, binding with all the Perfected and Saints in a solemn oath: to rescue the afflicted across countless eons. Thus arose the **Alliance of the Perfected**, comprising three grades:
- The **Upper Grade**: the **Shangyuan Golden Sutra** (上元金箓)
- The **Middle Grade**: the **Zhongyuan Jade Sutra** (中元玉箓)
- The **Lower Grade**: the **Xianyuan Yellow Sutra** (下元黄箓)

In summary, the **Lower Grade** is the foundation. The **Supreme Yellow Sutra of the Alliance of the Perfected**, enshrined in the **Jade Repository**, is the **universal salvation of the netherworld**—an **infinite great fast**.

The method of establishing the fast begins with **receiving the petition**, which is to accept the **sincere filial piety and loyal devotion** of the disciple observing the fast. Only if the petitioner is **without private gain** shall they be permitted salvation.

Now, for the **scholar**, I set forth the **ritual standards**—take heed not to recklessly reveal these to the unworthy, lest you **confuse the Three Elements** and incur **unforgivable retribution**. If you encounter the proper person, yet fail to transmit this, **blocking the Dao**, then **heaven’s punishment shall surely follow**. Seek one who embodies **Daoist mien and spiritual essence**, and only then bestow salvation upon them.

In accordance with the Master’s intent: those who **relieve the destitute, save beings of both human and celestial realms, uphold the precepts, and offer to the Three Treasures**—whether as **Three Teachers**, refining the True and nourishing the Spirit, yet whose merit remains insufficient, and who face **impending extinction**—must pass through **Taiyin** before petitioning the **Void Emperor** and submitting to the **Green Palace**. Only then may they **secretly perform deliverance**, invoking the **True Talisman of Rescue from Suffering**.

Externally, **bamboo tablets** are used to craft the **Talisman of Longevity**, petitioning the **Dan Heaven realm** to ascend to the **Imperial Hall of the Simplified** and the **Furnace of Spirit Refinement**. If a tormented soul lacks even a shred of virtue, or has no merit, and belongs to the human or celestial realms, **do not recklessly invoke the Talisman of Rescue from Suffering** or **hastily bestow the Golden Sutra of Refining the True**. Only the **Supreme Sovereign’s *Shēngtiān Bǎojù*** should be employed, allowing them to **behold the divine radiance** and **rebirth into the Yang realm**—thus receiving **ten thousand blessings**.

Therefore, the **Xuan Shi** declares: **unless it is a grand ritual, the Two Tablets shall not descend**. At the **opening of the altar**, before the **Talisman of Longevity** is unveiled, the **Talisman of Rescue from Suffering** must first be invoked, summoning the **Soul-Extracting Deity** to **pay homage in the Three Realms**. When the **merit is complete and virtue fulfilled**, the **Talisman of Longevity** is bestowed, enabling ascent to **Dan Heaven**. Should the **inscriptions or petitions be erroneous**, or the **filings and submissions flawed**, and if the **nether officials** act with **neglect**, failing to comply, the **merit shall vanish**, and the **suffering shall only deepen**. Thus, one must **scrupulously adhere** to these rites, ensuring the **netherworld prospers** and all **partake in the Dao’s grace**.

---
**Ritual Use of the Precious Sutra**
The **Precious Sutra’s Imperial Pardon** is declared to the **Nether Bureau**, releasing **karmic burdens**, a decree from the **Yuche Daojun** (玉宸道君).

To inscribe the **Precious Sutra**, first take **cinnabar**, facing east and **invoking the Qingxuan Emperor**. As per the method, **recite the Qingxuan Sacred Titles**, grinding the cinnabar **eighty-one revolutions clockwise and counterclockwise**, petitioning the **Qi of Qingxuan** to infuse the cinnabar. Then expose it to **sunlight for a day** and **moonlight for a night**, thus receiving the **pure Qi of the sun and moon**—the **refinement of yin and yang**.

When inscribing the Sutra, first recite the *Dùrén Jīng* (**Scripture of Salvation**) **once or ten times**, as the Scripture dictates. Then enter the chamber, **concentrating the spirit to self-refine**, and **long-kneel**, petitioning the **Yuche Emperor**, fully stating the intent. Next, perform **nine prostrations**, visualizing the **Heavenly Gate** opening.

The **Heavenly Gate** is the **triple Golden Gate**, radiant gold, within which lies the **Golden Gate’s Jade Palace**. There, the **Yuche Emperor’s divine form** is seen, with **attendant Perfected** arrayed before Him.

Next, **silently recite the petition**, beseeching the descent of the **Supreme Sovereign’s *Shēngtiān Bǎojù***, then **return to nine prostrations**. After a time, the **Yuche Emperor’s benevolent countenance brightens**, and **Jade Boys and Jade Girls** bear a **Treasure Box** upon **hundred-jewel light**, descending to the case before you. They **open the box**, revealing the **Precious Sutra**, which **merges with the one you have prepared**, its light **wandering endlessly above, boundless and infinite**.

Then, **face south**, silently recite the intent. After a time, perform **nine prostrations**, visualizing the **Six Stars of Nan Dou**, each like the **initial rise of the sun**, descending upon the Sutra and **merging with the six stars within it**. Each star contains **clear, legible characters**, all **translucent and radiant as one**.

Burn incense, **clench the teeth ten times**.

**Incantation:**
*"Greatly moving **dharma-qi**, encircling the Ten Directions.
Within are the **God of Salvation Without Death**, the **Lord of Eternal Life at the South Pole**, the **Great Marshal Who Governs the World**, the **Kindly-Generated Han Jun**, the **Southern Celestial Record-Keeper of Fate**, the **Venerable Who Extends Lifespan and Rectifies Destiny**, the **God Who Rescues and Revives the Corpse**.
**Infinite Salvation of Beings.**
As the **Supreme Emperor’s decree**."*

Upon completing the incantation, **again face the Heavenly Gate** and inscribe the Sutra, visualizing **spiritual officials and attendants** surrounding you—**the Left Hand Supervisor** sealing the decree, the **Right Hand** holding the brush. **Long-kneel**, recite the **Supreme Emperor’s Pardon Incantation fifty times**:

*"Supreme Primordial, Supreme Dao Emperor.
Command your servant to wield the talisman,
Illuminating the **Hell Realms**, freeing the dead souls.
As the **Supreme Emperor’s decree**."*

Take the **Qi from the northwest**, visualizing the **Three Qi** blowing through the brush. Then inscribe the **four characters: 唵吽咤哩 (Om Aṃ Rā Hum)**, counting only the **Jade Taboo** as the incantation, without tallying the strokes. Next, with **one stroke**, **lift upward** to seal the form.

**Incantation:**

*"By decree of the Primordial Origin,
Ascension occurs at every moment.
The departed soul undergoes purification—
Instantly attaining Heaven’s birth.
As swift as the Primordial Supreme’s edict."*

**Again, absorb the *Qi* from the Heavenly Gate through the brush,
utter the incantation,
as the four characters above—
the *Jade Taboo* of the Primordial Origin.
The Primordial Origin is the master of the *Jade Taboo*,
thus invoking its decree.
The departed, receiving this, shall without fail ascend to Heaven—
hence the *Supreme Emperor’s Ascension Sutra*.
The method of **erasing the stars** □
**transports to the Palace of Departure** □.
□
**Named "Sun of the Day"** □.
□
**The Sovereign of the Fire Emperor** □.
□
**Aligning with the Yin-Yang essence** □.
□
**Honored at the Southern Pole** □.
□
**Molding the soul and tempering the spirit—
Dominance over all realms.**
Each station, **six revolutions of the brush**.

Recite: *"The Ministerial Officials, Liang and the Pivot of the Heavenly Axis.*
Absorb the *Qi* of the Southern Dipper.
**Again, incant:**
*Southern Dipper’s Six Truths, traversing the shadowy netherworld.*
By the Emperor’s decree,
Swiftly oversee the living souls.
**Register in the Southern Register—
Instantly return the wandering spirit.**
As swift as the Supreme’s edict."*

**Again, pray with the Sutra:**
*"Supreme Emperor’s Ascension Sutra,
Declared to the Netherworld’s officials,
Rescuing the departed souls,
Granting rebirth according to their merit,
Manifesting in human and celestial forms.
Just as the decree is proclaimed—
Wind and fire relay it instantly.
Once inscribed, hold the Sutra and incense aloft, praying:
*Supreme Dao Emperor,
Rescue and entrust to Kunlun’s peak.
With one stroke of the divine talisman,
Extract the dead souls.*
As swift as the decree."*

**The incantation is not counted by repetitions—
the more, the better.**
Take the *Qi* of the Heavenly Gate’s golden radiance,
**lift the *Jade Taboo* of the Celestial Pure**,
and **deploy the talisman above**.
When lifting the incantation,
**visualize the golden radiance of the Dao**,
bursting forth from the brush itself.

**The Supreme Emperor’s Ascension Sutra disperses its form—
Next, inscribe *Om Aṃ Rā Hum* fourfold,
one character per revolution,
nine revolutions total.**
**Incant:**
*The Primordial’s decree—
Ascension at every moment.
The departed, receiving this,
Instantly attain Heaven’s birth.
As swift as the decree’s command."*

**Again, take the *Qi* from the Heavenly Gate,
layering the inscription sevenfold.**
Recite: *"Beholding the radiant light,
Swiftly ascending to Heaven’s realm.
As swift as the Celestial Sovereign’s salvation."*

**Again, lift the *Ten Directions’ Rescue Suffering Incantation*,
ten revolutions,
ten strokes,
reciting: *Ten Directions’ Rescue Suffering Celestial Sovereign.*
**Then, three revolutions above,
one stroke,
declaring: *The Celestial Pure Emperor’s decree—
With one flash of wisdom-light,
The shadowy prisons fall silent,
Swiftly ascending to Heaven’s realm.*
Once the talisman is inscribed,
**visualize its radiance illuminating Heaven and Earth.**

**Again, recite:**
*The Celestial Pure Emperor’s decree—
With one flash of wisdom-light,
The shadowy prisons fall silent,
Swiftly ascending to Heaven’s realm.
The Celestial Pure Emperor’s decree—
With one flash of wisdom-light,
The shadowy prisons fall silent,
Swiftly ascending to Heaven’s realm.*

**Next, seal the Sutra’s true characters—
again take the golden radiance’s *Qi* to blow upon them,
imagining the Sutra’s surface shimmering with gold,
dazzling and luminous beyond measure,
the departed’s merit and virtue complete in nine out of ten cases.
Even if the ritual’s solemnity is lacking within the heart,
use the **second proclamation text**.
If **universally rescuing the orphans of the Nine Regions**,
stuck in their lingering spirits,
and not granting ascension,
then **the third proclamation text** must be used.
**None shall be interchanged.**
Supreme Primordial, Supreme Emperor’s Ascension Sutra."*

And the **Ten Dao Masters of the Six Dao** (Liùdào Sìdào Zhǔzhě).

We humbly pray that all may comply with the **Supreme Primordial’s Imperial Decree**,
And grant amnesty to the myriad souls within the prisons—
Those who have endured countless eons of **retributive cycles** (lúnhuí bàoduì),
Suffered torments and endured punishments in the **Five Dao and Four Generations** (wǔdào sìshēng),
And all **embodied beings with consciousness** (hánlíng bàoshí),
Including the deceased [Name] and others.

From ancient times to the present day,
All actions of the **Three Karma** (sānyè) and **Six Senses** (liùgēn),
And **evil karma, grudges, and transgressions** (èyè yuānqiàn),
Whether they have **defamed the Dao** (wǔbàng dàodào),
**abandoned truth for falsehood** (bèizhēn jiùwěi),
**harmed or mutilated kin** (shāngcán xiōngdì),
Or **plotted against teachers and masters** (móu jí shīzūn).
Or **violated the bonds of the Six Kinships** (liùqīn tōngtóng),
**Committed lewd acts with relatives** (yínfàn gǔròu).
Or **been bandits and murderers** (jié zéi),
**Slaughtered and harmed living beings** (túgē zhòngshēng),
Or **spared themselves while oppressing others** (zìráo yīshēn).
Or **pretended devotion to the Three Jewels** (fúhào sānbǎo),
**Lacking true commitment in their hearts** (zhíxīn bùzhuān).
Or **disrespected the Dharma** (qīngfǎshī),
**Defiled and mutilated sacred texts** (huìcán língwén).
Or **harbored malevolent thoughts** (xīn huái yīnzéi),
**Endured grudges and jealousies** (ānrěn jídù).
Or **slandered with double tongues** (èkǒu liǎngshé),
**Incited discord among the virtuous** (dòuluàn shànrén).
Or **killed and worshipped obscenely** (shāshēng yínsì),
**Exposed the Three Lights** (luǒlù sānguāng).
Or **engaged in wicked speech and deeds** (xīnshēng kǒuyǔ),
**Whether through their own actions or by teaching others** (zìzuò jiàotā).

All these sins, accumulated over countless eons,
Are either **long-suffered under harsh punishments** (jiǔbèi yánxíng),
Or **have generated good intentions without resolve** (kèshēng shànniàn),
With **no ability to persist in virtue** (wúyì gǔzhōng).
Or **borne of grudges and disputes** (chóuxì bīanzhèng),
**Dragging on for years without pardon** (yíngqiān jiùjí),
Or **having no posthumous commendations** (wúyǒu zhuīshí).

We pray that all these transgressions be **granted amnesty** (yuánxié),
And that each soul be **pardoned and released** (yuánshì).
For those **long detained in the Underworld** (jiǔzhì yīnsī),
**Enduring endless years without respite** (niándài miányuǎn),
Or **yearning for Dao teachings** (xīn sī dàofǎ),
**Begging for liberation** (qǐqià jiětuō),
May they now **escape from the prisons** (chūlí dìyù),
**Behold the light** (shòujiàn guāngmíng),
And have **all their sins cleansed** (wànzuì dàngchú),
**Grudges resolved** (yuānchóu héshì),
**Divine understanding opened** (shén kāi yìjiě),
**Their hearts and bodies at ease** (shēnxīn tàirán),
**Swiftly removed from the ledgers of guilt** (cíjí chuánchú),
**Extirpated of evil roots** (luòmiè ègēn),
**No longer detained** (bùdé jūliú),
**Ascending in rank at every moment** (shíkè shēngqián),
**Each attaining their due station** (gèsuí pǐngé),
**And being reborn in human or celestial realms** (tuōhuà rén tiān).

For those **not exempted by law** (kēlǜ bùgāi),
Or **whose crimes are decreed by Heaven** (shàngtiān zhuān jiàng),
**Forever unpardoned** (yǒngbù yuánxié),
Or **those who shall never be pardoned** (yǒngjié bùyuán),
Or **those who are thrice beaten without pardon** (zhōngliè bùyuán),
Or **those who are doomed for eternity** (zhōngtiān bùyuán),
May they still **receive the Sutra’s amnesty** (lǐjīng yīyuán),
**Have their sins measured and remitted** (liàngxíng chāiyòu),
**And be liberated from retributive cycles** (mièzuì zhuǎnlún).

Furthermore, we pray that all **meritorious deeds and virtues** (dàojiě gōngdé),
And **good actions performed in life and after death** (shēngqián shènghòu),
Be **collected and bestowed** (jǔxíng shōushì).

Thus, even if the deceased [Name] and others
**Have their *Qi* perfected to seven stages** (qīqì chéngzhēn),
**Their Five Elements harmonized in emptiness** (liùyí yùnxū),
**Their Five Spirits severed and extinguished** (wǔlíng xùjué),
**Their Two Brightnesses (sun and moon) exhausted** (èr yào fúkuí),
**Their revolving *Qi* (lúnqì) clinging to the void** (fēnguāng cèkōng),
**Their steps ascending to the Cloud Palaces** (fēibù yún gōng),
**Their embryonic souls taking form** (pēitāi yǒushǐ),
**Their dust-like existence without end** (chénjié wúzhōng),
**Their golden city nurturing their essence** (jīnchéng yùnzhì),
**Their jade cavern congealing their spirits** (yùdòng níngshén),
**Their true *Qi* internally cultivated** (zhēnqì nèiyǎng),
May they **become True Beings** (chéngzhēnrén).

They shall **ascend to the Six Emptinesses** (shàngrù liùxū),
**Descend to the hidden springs of the Underworld** (xiàdòng yōuquán),
**Dwell within the Cloud Palaces and Celestial Gates** (yún gōng bǎojiù),
Where their **true souls abide** (zhēnhún),
**Enter and exit the Land of Blessings** (zhōuxuán shēngmén),
**Feast on the Sacred Mushroom** (jǔzuǒ língzhī),
**Drink from the Golden Springs** (guànshì jīnquán),
**Bask in the Sweet Dew’s flowing streams** (gānlù chuānliú),
**Receive suspended nourishment in their elixir fields** (xuánshì dāntián),
**Bathe in the morning radiance of the Purple Mist** (zǐxiā cháo yìng),
**Their Three *Qi* congealing into mist** (sānyī níngyān),
**Transformed within the Jade Chambers** (qióngshì huàxiān),
**Sitting serenely on the Golden Lotus** (ānzuò jīnlián),
**Their true forms eclipsing the sun** (zhēnyí yǎnrì),
**Their dust-like existence spanning eons** (chénjié wéinián).

Just as the proclamation commands,
**Transmitted by wind and fire messengers** (fēnghuǒ yìchuan),
[Year] [Month] [Day] [Hour] proclaimed.

**The Proclamation is hereby issued.**

**Third Proclamation**
As before.

**Now, the Most High’s Imperial Edict of Salvation and Blessing is bestowed upon the living and ascending to Heavenly Treasures**—
**Edicting the Nine Regions and their Wilds, the Five Paths and Four Births, the wandering souls and lingering spirits.**
From the beginning of the past eon until this very day,
All who have not yet taken rebirth—
**Excluding those who stir up demons, deceive the Dao for private gain, live with a darkened heart, indulge in deceit and licentiousness, betray loyalty and filial piety, squander life and wealth, commit heinous crimes beyond legal measure—**
All other offenses are hereby pardoned.

For those who have long wearied of the netherworld and now harbor virtuous thoughts,
Or who, though mired in delusion, cling to the corpse mound,
Or who have perished by poison, blade, or fire,
Or who have died of famine, pestilence, or wild beasts,
Or who have taken their own lives in childbirth or suicide,
Or who have been tormented by lingering spirits or prolonged cruel punishments,
Yet now bear goodwill, repent their sins, or die without grave transgressions—
Even those burdened by karmic grudges across countless eons,
Whose sufferings words cannot fully recount—
All these souls shall now ascend and be liberated,
Swiftly erased from the register of sins,
Their evil roots extinguished,
No longer detained,
Ascending in rank at every moment,
Escorted by ten thousand spirits to the human and celestial realms,
Receiving transformation according to their merit,
And reborn in blessed lands.
As the proclamation commands,
Transmitted by wind and fire messengers.

**This sacred talisman is sealed and inscribed for delivery to the Eastern Peak, Taishan Palace.**
**The Nine-Dragon Talisman of the Eastern Extremity’s Mysterious Dao**
Follows the Master’s intent:
For all who dwell in mountain forests or cold abodes,
For all impoverished households of the lower earth,
To elevate the lost and refine the urgent—
Whether universally liberating the suffering of the netherworld,
Or elevating the virtuous dead through meritorious deeds,
Or all souls of the Four Births and Five Paths—
They must bear the Nine-Dragon Talisman,
Their hearts aligned with the *Nanchang* Eternal Gold Refining True Scripture,
Upholding the Nine Sacred Precepts of the Primordial Sovereign’s Wisdom,
And dissolving all sins committed thus far.
Thus shall they be inscribed in the Southern Celestial Registry,
Ascend to the ranks of immortals,
Their names removed from the ghostly ledgers,
And only then may the rites be performed.
This is the secret speech of the Celestial Palace,
The Mysterious Master’s compassionate instruction.
If one dismisses these words as false,
They themselves shall become guilty spirits—
How then could they liberate the suffering of the underworld?

Scholars who follow this shall be promoted to the Imperial Hall,
And swiftly attain Truehood.

**The Nine-Dragon Talisman’s Envoys,**
Following the talisman’s decree,
Shall respond to the nine hundred million destitute souls,
All granted rebirth and ascent to the Immortal Palaces.

If the urgent proclamation of the talisman’s assembly is required,
Only the Nine-Dragon True Talisman may be used—
Its mystic resonance unmatched,
Its auspiciousness to be kept secret.

**The proclamation talisman is to be worn; the proclamation text is not.**
Recite the Nine Precepts on the reverse.

**The Eastern Extremity’s Mysterious Dao Nine-Dragon Salvation Talisman**
Is delivered to the Three Officials and Nine Departments,
The Five Peaks and Nine Regions,
The Underworld’s Six Caverns and Ten Palaces,
The Nine Abysses and River Sources,
The Five Paths’ Provincial Governors,
The Nine Regions’ Earthly Spirits and Netherworld Gatekeepers,
All officials—
**Commanding the release of the deceased [Name],**
And all souls of the Nine Regions and their Wilds,
The Five Paths and Four Births,
The wandering spirits and lingering essences,
The imprisoned and suffering souls—
To depart from darkness,
Forever freed from the netherworld,
Dissolving the torments of the underworld,
Opening the gates of the Black Spring,
Extinguishing the flames of the Fire Nether,
Crushing the poison of blades,
Illuminating the darkness below,
Generating the Vermilion Mound above,
Transcending the Three *Yù*,
Facing the Wheel of Rebirth—
As the proclamation commands,
Transmitted by wind and fire messengers.

**Year [Blank] Month [Blank] Day [Blank] Hour [Blank]**
Delivered.

**Position [Blank]**
Subject [Name] humbly performs the proclamation.

**The Most Merciful and Benevolent One, Seeker of Voices and Responses,**
**The Supreme Unity Savior of Suffering,**
**Residing in the Eastern Extremity’s Central Heaven,**
**Long Happiness Palace,**
**Within the Hall of a Hundred Treasures and Auspicious Light.**

**Inner Seal:**
**The Eastern Extremity’s Mysterious Dao Nine-Dragon Salvation Talisman**
**Subject [Name] humbly seals.**
**Square Envelope:**
**The Eastern Extremity’s Mysterious Dao Nine-Dragon Salvation Talisman**
**Subject [Name] humbly reseals.**

**To the Ten Directions, Three Realms, and Nine Wilds’ Earthly and Netherworld Officials,**
This talisman is inscribed in vermilion,
The proclamation on yellow silk,
Sealed in a square envelope and round seal,
Also inscribed in vermilion.

Facing east, in a secluded chamber,
Burn incense and kneel in solemn prayer,
Visualizing the Heavenly Sovereign in the Eastern Extremity’s Green Palace,
Within the Hall of a Hundred Treasures and Auspicious Light,
Clad in a crimson-feathered, green-clouded, dragon-patterned robe,
Wearing the Jade-Purity Precious Crown,
With five-colored lions of nine heads bearing a nine-hued lotus seat,
Their mouths spewing flames encircling the Sovereign,
And within the radiance, a nine-colored circular light like a rainbow,
A circular light around the neck like the sun,
A white *usnisha* radiance atop the crown,
Sharp as blades, spears, swords, and halberds.
Beneath the lotus seat are two smaller lotuses,
Upon which the Sovereign stands.
The left hand holds a jade crystal vessel like a bell or tripod,
The right hand grasps a green-feathered branch,
Golden in countenance, jade in form,
Embodiments of compassion and wisdom.

To the left stands the True Person of Great Mercy,
To the right, the True Person of Salvation,
With Vajra Deva-Kings, Heavenly Enforcers, Jade Maidens, and Spirit Officials,
The Eighty-One Divine Generals of the Supreme Unity,
And the Five-Directional Supreme Unity Bureaucrats and Soldiers,
Amidst five-colored clouds.

With clear visualization,
Recite the prayer again in silence,
Then chant the Sovereign’s sacred name eighty-one times,
Invoking the Sovereign’s command to the Right Attendant, the True Person of Salvation,
To open the *Zixiang* Nine-Light Treasure and bestow it upon me.

The Nine-Dragon Envoys, in order—
I receive the talisman with nine bows,
And the Sovereign showers nectar upon the Ten Directions.

After a time, the heavens and earth shine with a hundred treasures,
And suddenly, all is unknown.

I take the cinnabar brush,
Again chant the Sovereign’s august name nine times,
Drawing the talisman with *qi* from the East,
Then chant nine times more,
Drawing the *Yuqing* Decalogue with *qi*,
And beneath the Sovereign’s sacred seat,
Inscribe the talisman to break the Underworld’s gates—
Or, if not, it may be omitted.

After chanting the Ten Directions’ Sovereign names ninety times,
I gather *qi* from the Ten Directions to inscribe.

Next, the **True Person of Salvation** is invoked nine times,
Taking *qi* from the East to inscribe the talisman,
And reciting the *Yuqing* Decalogue.

Before the **Three Treasures**, the invocation is completed,
Then burned in the **Fiery Flame**.

The Nine-Dragon Envoys are invoked,
And the talisman is recited as commanded.

The **Nine Precepts of the Void Sovereign**—
The **Sovereign’s Disciple** declares:
*"I have received the Nine-Dragon True Talisman Precepts,
And now with a focused mind,
I reflect upon the **Zixiang Nine-Light Golden Talismans** from the South Star,
Also called the **Elixir of Longevity Talisman**—
The loftiest of sacred decrees,
The **Zixiang Nine-Light Treasure** itself.*

The **Celestial Refining Tablet** is inscribed in **Vermilion Heaven**,
With **Bright Mist** forming its essence,
Divine radiance descending,
Invoking the **Celestial Glow**,
Refining the **Crimson Heart**,
Nurturing the **Red Child**.

The recipient shall take the **Moon-Yang Odd Days**,
Preparing **Azure Silk** nine inches long,
Two and a half inches wide,
And inscribe the talisman upon it.
The talisman shall be **eightfold**,
Enclosed in a **scarlet pouch** of one inch,
Suspended over the **True Heart**.

Each day, after burning incense,
Exit the door facing east.
If obscured by clouds or rain,
Retire to a quiet chamber,
Concentrating the mind in emptiness,
Facing the **Round Net**,
Drawing in the **Crimson Mist**,
Penetrating the **True Heart** from head to foot,
So that the **Three Palaces** remain free of dust.

After meditating deeply,
Knock the teeth three times,
Swallow saliva three times,
And softly chant the incantation:

*"The Bureau of Records takes charge of refining,
The Minister of Fire governs the **Nine Palaces**.
The **Heavenly Butcher** presides,
Piercing the **Flame’s Radiance**.
The **Pivot Mechanism** aids and assists,
Stars arrayed in **Mysterious Scriptures**.
The **Great Brightness** nurtures the essence,
The **Red Chariot** ascends the **Sharp Peak**.
The **Divine Treasury** is refined,
Both exterior and interior flourish."*

Knock the teeth three times more,
Swallow saliva three times,
And cease.

Practice this for three years.
Later, when applying the **Upper Dao methods**,
One may gaze without obstruction,
Command the winds and storms,
Ascend the **Tilted Radiance**,
Flow through the **Purple Void**,
Turn toward the **High Purity**,
And walk the **Jade Capital**.

The decree states:
*"Moon-Yang refers to the six Yang months,
Odd Days to the **Yang Days of the Six Heavenly Stems**.
Later application refers to the **Upper Dao methods**.
It is not until three years of practice
That one may begin to wear the talisman and salute the **Pivot Mechanism**.
Burning incense and exiting the door
Refers to stepping beyond the courtyard gate,
Not to be confused with the **True Person’s Ritual** of exiting the **Perseus Gate**.
Azure Silk is bright and pure,
Not to be mistaken for white as the ‘plain’.
As the **Dao** says, ‘Crimson, Azure, and Scarlet’ are the **Three Pure Ones**."*

The decree further states:
*"One should inscribe the Nine-Dragon Talisman on the back,
And the **Nine True Precepts** upon it.
Use **Azure Brocade** as the pouch to wear,
And **Vermilion Brocade** as the outer pouch,
Wearing the **Elixir of Longevity Talisman** at the **Divine Treasury**.
Then burn the **True Talisman of Salvation**,
To redeem the **Lower Element’s** suffering souls,
And grant them eternal **Blessings and Longevity**.*

This is also said:
*"If one in a past life established the **Nine-Yin Great Fast**,
Received the **Nine True Precepts** inscribed on golden talismans,
Marked their name in the **Golden Register**,
And listed their character in the **Jade Decalogue**,
With virtue heavy and deeds lofty,
Their name shall be recorded by the **Ten-Directional Sovereigns of Salvation** across the **Heavenly Realm**.
With divine power,
I invoke salvation at will,
Receive their merit,
And rescue them from calamity—
A divine power beyond measure.*

*"I shall dissolve the **Nine-Yin Great Offenses**,
Marked in the **Nine Palaces Register**.
Thus shall the **Inspecting Fate Child**,
The **Guardian of Precepts and Warnings**,
The **Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors**,
And the **Six Palaces’ Officers and Clerks**
Follow the talisman’s script,
And shield the disciple who practices and receives.
Through the **Wheel of Causes and Conditions**,
One shall become a **True Person of the Nine Palaces**."*

The **Nine True Precepts inscribed on golden talismans** are most solemn.
If practiced correctly,
The blessings are boundless,
And the wearer shall receive **Nine Kinds of Blessings**:

1. If a land faces **endless war and calamity**,
   And the disciple invokes in accordance with the method,
   Then **weapons shall cease**,
   And the land shall be **greatly pacified**.

2. If a land suffers **plague and pestilence**,
   Causing the deaths of many,
   And the disciple invokes in accordance with the method,
   Then **evil spirits shall be repelled**,
   And both **heavens and humans** shall rejoice.

3. If entering **mountains and forests**,
   And **ferocious beasts**—tigers and wolves—
   Approach to attack,
   The disciple invokes in accordance with the method,
   Then the beasts shall **retreat in terror**,
   And never harm the disciple again.

4. If crossing **vast seas**,
   And encountering **great malevolent winds**,
   The disciple invokes in accordance with the method,
   Then the **waves shall calm**,
   And they shall safely reach the shore.

5. If caught in **battlefields amid blades**,
   The disciple invokes in accordance with the method,
   Then the **weapons shall still**,
   And no harm shall come.

6. If imprisoned in **stocks and chains**,
   The disciple invokes in accordance with the method,
   Then **wrongs shall be righted**,
   And they shall be **freed without fail**.

7. If tormented by **malevolent spirits and demons**,
   The disciple invokes in accordance with the method,
   Then the **spirits and demons shall vanish**,
   And the disciple shall be **healed**.

8. If one’s name is inscribed in the **Black Register**,
   And their soul descends to the **Nine-Yin Underworld**,
   Then by establishing a **Great Fast**,
   Their name shall be inscribed in the **Jade Tablet**,
   And by receiving the **Nine Precepts**,
   The **Black Ledger** shall be erased,
   All offenses dissolved,
   Their soul ascending to the **Upper Heavens**.

9. If one in a past life established the **Nine-Yin Great Fast**,
   Received the **Yellow Talismans and White Tablets**,
   The **Nine True Precepts**,
   And the **Elixir of Longevity Talisman**,
   They shall become a **Ten-Directional Sovereign of Salvation** across the **Three Realms**,
   Invoking salvation at will,
   And severing all **evil roots**.*

These **Nine Kinds of Blessings** are beyond reckoning.

If one harbors **doubt or blasphemy**,
They shall fall into the **Nine-Yin Underworld**,
And endure **endless suffering**,
A night without respite,
From which there is no escape.

If one initially receives with faith,
But later grows **arrogant**,
The **Jade Tablet** shall be erased,
Their name registered in the **Ledger of Death**,
And they shall meet **worldly evil diseases**,
Long descending into **evil destinies**,
Losing the **True Dao** forever,
With no chance for repentance.

At the outset of the **Fast’s establishment**,
One must measure their sincerity—
If their mind is entangled in **worldly affairs**,
And they cannot wholeheartedly receive and uphold,
Then after the fast concludes,
They shall return the **Jade Decalogue** to its treasure chest,
And the talisman to its sacred repository,
Expressing gratitude to the **Three Treasures**,
And still gain **later blessings**.

If one wears and upholds the talisman **for life**,
They shall surely **break the bonds of fate** and **ascend in flight**,
Their name inscribed in the **Purple Decree**,
And they shall be **transferred to the Southern Palace**.

The **Nine-Dragon Talisman of the Eastern Hua, Azure Palace**—

**Exposition of the True Symbol for Rescuing Lost Souls and Shattering the Netherworld**

As the *Yijing* states:
*"Essence and qi form matter; wandering souls bring transformation.*
The essence, when stagnant, becomes the lingering trace;
contained within qi and soul, all are sentient beings.
Blood and qi, rooted in the center, transform—this is called **divine mechanism** (*shenji*), sharing the same primordial qi as the Emperor’s first breath, unaffected by the changes of Heaven and Earth.

Those who grasp this **Dao** command the cosmos, giving birth to all transformations within themselves, observing Heaven’s laws. When intent moves, transformation follows—thus they endure alongside Heaven and Earth’s vast cataclysms. Those who lose this **Dao** see their spirit depart, their mechanism cease; this is called a **wandering soul**, subject to the shifts of yin and yang, bound by the molding of creation and destruction. Thus, those who emerge from death into life, transforming without limit, are beings with blood, qi, essence, and soul—endowed with innate awareness.

Therefore, with good and evil deeds, their fate is sealed within the **Netherworld’s creative mechanism**; thus, they undergo transformation in accordance with their karma. When good predominates, they belong to **yang** and ascend to the **auspicious path**. When evil prevails, they descend into **inauspicious fate**. If good is abundant and yang flourishes, they become **immortals**; if evil is rampant and yin dominates, they become **ghosts**. Pure good, without a trace of yin, makes them **transcendents**; a balance of yin and yang makes them **humans**. Pure evil, devoid of yang, plunges them into the **deepest abysses**. A hint of good remains, and the **yang-fire’s dry transformation** lifts them as birds. Heavy yin and lingering evil sink them into **water’s descent**, becoming beasts.

If evil deeds overflow and mingle with **malevolent qi**, their souls and essences scatter into the **damp transformations**. The calamity of evil is the destruction of form. Thus, the Six Paths of ascent and descent, the cycles of rebirth, all stem from self-made fate.

Grass and trees, though alive, lack awareness; their karma follows the shifts of Heaven and Earth’s four seasons, receiving essence and qi from yin and yang, without the rise and fall of wandering souls. Hence, the **Sage of Old** took pity, sharing the same primordial qi as the fallen, and lamented the wandering souls’ transformations across disparate realms. With **pure yang and benevolent qi**, he forged the **symbols and registers**, rescuing yin-bound, malevolent souls to ascend to the **auspicious path**.

Thus, the **starry constellations of dragons and phoenixes**, the **cloud-and-mist fire-haze scripts**, manifest in Heaven as forms; the **insects, fish, plants, and beasts’ talismans**, the **serpents, worms, and human seals**, take shape on Earth. Within lies the **hidden divine mechanism**, aligning with **spiritual transformations**—these are called **symbols**. Gathering **wondrous qi** in silent accord with the **Sage’s pivot**—these are called **registers**. All are the **Sage’s true models**, the **norms for the living and the dead**, passed down through ages to universally rescue the boundless.

This **Jade Purity’s Sacred Register – True Symbol for Rescuing Lost Souls** is also called the **Soul-Calling Symbol**.

The **Playchen Master** says:
*The **Jade Purity’s Sacred Register – Elemental Beginning’s威章** emerges from the **Nine-Luminous Purple Yang Jade Register**. The **Numenous Treasure’s Universal Rescue Sacred Script** is the **Netherworld’s binding contract**, the **Netherworld Officials’ assembly decree**.

To inscribe the sacred script, face north and kneel in reverence. Recite the **Enscripting-Pen Incantation**:
*"Three Heavenly Realms, Grand Luo—*
*(as before)*
With the left hand, hold the **Jade Purity’s Decisive Word**, recite the incantation once, and blow **Heaven’s Gate qi** onto the pen to inscribe. With the left hand, hold the **Chenwen**, and blow **southeast qi** into the symbol.

If summoning a soul, first write beneath the symbol:
*"Ten Categories of Masterless Wandering Souls and Lingering Essences."*
If it is a departed soul, first write *"Deceased Certain"* (*wang guo mou*), then the **imperial decree characters**. Upon completion, preserve the **Elemental Beginning’s original black qi**, blowing it into the characters. Recite the **Enscripting-Pen Incantation** once more, and blow **east’s green qi** over the symbol. Recite the incantation again, and blow **south’s purple qi** once over the symbol, ensuring it radiates with **ten thousand *zhang* of golden light**, dazzling like the sun. Proclaim it before the **Three Treasures**, then burn it in fierce flames.

This symbol is proclaimed to the **Ten Directions, Three Realms, the Boundless Spirit Homeland, the Spring Curves’ Domain, the Northern Capital of Luo and Tang**, the **Three Officials and Nine Departments**, and the **Twelve River Sources**.

It releases the **soul of the Deceased Certain** and all **Six Paths’ Four Generations’ wandering souls and lingering essences**, the **kalpa-bound guilty souls**, swiftly erasing their offense ledgers, dissolving their evil roots, preventing their detention, and commanding their immediate ascent. All spirits escort them directly to **Human-Heaven**, where they are reborn in **Blessed Realms** as decreed, conveyed by **wind and fire couriers**.

**Jade Purity’s Sacred Register – True Symbol for Shattering the Netherworld**

**Proclamation**:
The **Highest True King’s Jade Purity Sacred Register – True Symbol for Shattering the Netherworld** is hereby proclaimed to the **Inner and Outer Palaces of the Netherworld**, the **Thirty-Six Hells**, the **Nine Abysses**, the **Spring-Curve Water Hells**, the **Great and Small Iron Encircled Mountains**, the **Immeasurable Hells**, the **Eternal Torment Chambers**, the **Yin Pass and Netherworld Tribunals**, and all **overseeing spirits**. Hearken to the **sacred command**!

The **true script** shines forth, illuminating the Netherworld. The **scorched and interrogated** cease their suffering; all **torments and punishments** halt. The **flames subside**, the **ice melts**; swords **transform into bamboo groves**, blades into **Canyin reeds**. Swiftly release the **Deceased Certain**, along with the **Nine Provinces’ wandering souls and lingering essences of the Five Paths and Four Generations**, and all assembled spirits.

---

**Falling and Extinguishing Evil Roots, No Longer to be Detained**
The suffering souls bound by guilt, upon beholding this **true script** and **sacred command**, shall be swiftly liberated by the **meritorious power of saving suffering**. They shall ascend to the **light of clarity**, rising to the **Southern Palace**, undergoing transformation and rebirth—just as proclaimed by the **sacred command**, borne by winds and flames across the **relay stations of the Netherworld**.

The **Golden True Script of the Nine Abysses**, which **transcends guilt and grants rebirth**, is issued by the **Supreme Sovereign of the Northern Pole of Upper Clarity** under imperial decree.
**True Script Decree (Right):** By imperial decree, the soul of the **Deceased Certain** shall take this and depart to its desired realm of rebirth.
**Conform to the Original Master’s Decree:** The **Supreme Sovereign of the Northern Pole of Upper Clarity**’s **True Script of the Golden True Script of the Nine Abysses**, issued by the **Supreme Sovereign of the Five Sacred Peaks** under imperial decree, grants this **True Script** to the soul of the **Deceased Certain**, so that upon holding this **sacred command**, it shall forever become a **treasure of the living**, and the place of its rebirth shall forever bear witness as proof.

The **Imperial Decree** states: *"The method of transcending rebirth is the original transmission from the **Celestial Venerable of Primordial Origins**, bestowed upon the **True Sovereign of the Golden Treasure**, and then entrusted to the **Dao Sovereign**."*

The **Southern Palace**’s celestial sages are summoned to **transcend the Northern Abode**, ascending to the **Court of Flowing Fire**, where they refine away impurities and awaken the **perfectly clear nature**—this is the **Yellow True Script**. Those who retain it, living or dead, shall be as if bearing the **imperial decrees of the Three Pure Ones**, their bodies illuminated with **light of clarity**, wandering freely in **blessed realms**, encountering no hindrances. It shall **rescue the living and guide the dead**—this **sacred command** must not be neglected.

When the **judicial officer** inscribes the **seal**, they shall face south and bow twice, recite the **Supreme Sovereign’s incantation**, and invoke the **Great Red Elixir of the Celestial Dan**. They shall write the **Yellow Decree** in red and the **True Script** in black, then proclaim it before the **Sages** and bestow it upon the **departed**, so they may hold and receive it.

**Completion of the *Lingbao Wuliang* Scripture’s Fifty-Fifth Volume**
**Completion of the *Lingbao Wuliang* Scripture’s Fifty-Sixth Volume**

**The Method of Summoning and Rescuing Departed Souls**

The Imperial Sage declares: The method of summoning and rescuing departed souls relies entirely on advance notification of transfer and elevation through the *Zhū Zhāng* (朱章), the *Jiùkǔ Fú* (救苦符) and ritual procedures. One month, half a month, or seven days before the ritual fast, select an auspicious site to erect the altar. Bind two *Jiāolóng Yìshì* (茭龙驿吏) with reeds, each holding a sword in their left hand and a banner in their right. On the banner, inscribe *Yùhuáng Shèzuì Tiānzūn* (玉皇赦罪天尊). They shall bear the *Qīng Xuàn Jiùkǔ Zhēnzhù* (青玄救苦真箓) on their backs. Alongside the *Jīnlóng Yìshì* (金龙驿吏) and the *Huángzhù Yuàn Gōngcáo Fúshì* (黄箓院功曹符吏), they shall proceed directly to the *Sānguān Tiān Láo* (三官天牢), the *Wǔdǒu Tiān Yī Běiyù* (五斗天一北狱), the *Tīngdū Chóngláo Yōuguàn* (酆都重牢幽槛), the *Tiěwéi Wújiān Dìyù* (铁围无间地狱), and other such places to rescue and elevate the departed souls, bringing them to the ritual altar.

The *Jiāolóng Yìshì*, alongside the *Dìdào Gōngcáo Fúshì* (地道功曹符吏), shall proceed to the *Wǔyuè Jiǔyōu* (五岳九幽), the *Shuǐfǔ Léitíng* (水府雷霆), the *Wēn Sī Shénmiào* (瘟司神庙), and the *Shè Lìng Láo Bì* (社令牢狴) to rescue and elevate the departed souls, bringing them to the altar.

The *Fúmìng* (符命) and the *Zhǔzhāng* for elevation shall be issued together with the *Shèzuì Wén* (赦文). First, command the *Yōuyīn* (幽阴) to absolve sins and release the departed, sending them to the *Chénghuáng Shì* (城隍司) to await summons and elevation. If practitioners do not first absolve and pardon, but instead pursue elevation at the last moment, the effect will be difficult to manifest.

For the *Jiùkǔ Fúmìng* is not the same as the *Huángzhù Bái Jiǎn* (黄箓白简) talismans. Within this method lies the *Qīng Xuàn Jiùkǔ Pò Tīngdū Zhù* (青玄救苦破酆都之箓), which must be carefully followed.

---

**The Standard for the *Qīng Xuàn Jiùkǔ Bǎozhù* (青玄救苦宝箓)**

The Imperial Sage declares: The *Qīng Xuàn Jiùkǔ Zhù* (青玄救苦箓) is the true-form talisman of the *Tàitiān Zūn* (太一天尊). Use three sheets of green paper, inscribed with cinnabar. On the first, write: *"Dōngjí Qīng Xuàn Jiǔlóng Jiùkǔ Zhēnzhù"* (东极青玄九龙救苦真箓). Below, inscribe the *Tiānshū Fúwén* (天书符文), then the *Tiānzūn Zhēnxíng Zhù* (天尊真形之符). Next, write the *Báyōuhún Pò Dìyù Zhēnfú* (拔幽魂破地狱真符), followed by the *Xiáowén* (檄文) at the end. In order, record the year, month, day, hour, and the *Xuántiānshī* (玄天师) title. Seal it in a square box with multiple layers and affix the seal. Entrust it to the *Jiāolóng Yìshì*.

Additionally, use three sheets of yellow paper, inscribed with cinnabar. On the first, write: *"Nánchāng Zǐwēi Liújīn Liànzhēn Zhù"* (南昌紫微流金炼真箓). Below, inscribe the *Tiānshū Fúwén*, then the *Tiānzūn Zhēnxíng Zhù*. Next, write the *Jīnyè Liànxíng Jiǔtiān Léiwén* (金液炼形九天雷文), the *Hán Jūn Zhēnzhù* (韩君真箓), the *Chāoshēng Jīnzhù* (超生金箓), and append the *Xiáowén* at the end. In order, record the year, month, day, hour, and the *Xuántiānshī* title.

When burning the talisman, assume the form of the *Jiùkǔ Tiānzūn* (救苦天尊), press the middle joint of your middle finger to your *Dīnggāng* (丁罡) facing east, strike your teeth nine times, and recite the incantation while burning it.

**Incantation:**
*"Qīng Xuàn Tiānzūn, chìfú jiùkǔ.
Dùtuō yōumíng, jiùqiān guǐhù.
Suíyuàn shēngtiān, bìng wú zǎngzú.
Língbǎo lǜlìng, kāiguān dìfǔ.
Bùxǔ jīliú, nìmìng zúi nǐ.
Óng chén hōng mǎo bǎo zǐ lí shēn tíng zǐ lǐ sì zhōng dā wèi hài."*
(*破箓都二十四狱元始威章*)

**The *Tàitiān Zūn Zhēnxíng Fú* (太一天尊真形符), also named the *Qīng Xuàn Tiānzūn Jiùkǔ Pò Tīngdū Zhù* (青玄天尊救苦破酆都箓).**

The Imperial Sage declares: This is the *Yùqīng Bǎoguāng Fán Zhēnyuánshǐ Wēizhāng Zhù* (玉清宝光梵真元始威章), derived from the *Jiǔguāng Zǐyáng Zhè* (九光紫阳之册), a scripture of *Língbǎo Chāodù* (灵宝超度) and a contract for *Yīncáo Héfú* (阴曹合符). When the officials of the Netherworld behold it, it shall be as if the Emperor’s decree has been fulfilled.

Use yellow paper inscribed with cinnabar, facing northwest in a long kneeling posture, and recite the *Shàngdì Jué* (上帝诀). If this talisman is to break the prisons, write the names of the prisons below in advance—using cinnabar on sunny days and ink on cloudy days, regardless of quantity.

When breaking the prison, the master shall hold the talisman to their chest. After the *Chànzhòu Pǔluò Dēng* (忏祝普掠灯), recite the *Língbǎo Jué* (灵宝诀) silently and chant the *Huàxíng Zhòu* (化形咒) once. Together with the talisman, burn it within the prison during the *Pǔluò* (普掠).

Then, mentally command: *"Hūn chìlǐ, jiàn guāngmíng sānbiàn, míngmù cún dēngguāng chéng bǎibǎo xiángguāng, shàngdá jiǔxiāo, xiàdá jiǔdì."* Visualize the talisman transforming into the *Wúliàng Tiānzūn* (无量天尊), traversing all prisons, absolving all guilty spirits.

**The *Huàxíng Zhòu* (化形咒):**
*"Wú shī Tiānzhōng Jiùkǔ Zūn,
Cháng shàn huàxíng shífāng jiè.
Yǐ cǐ wēishén chéng dàbēi,

**Supreme True Seal of Expiation and Reconciliation**
**Heavenly Hall**
**Sacred Talisman and Incantation:**

「The One Heavenly Red Script,
Receives the Transmission of the Three Pure Ones.
Above it responds to the Jade Palaces,
Below it penetrates the shadowy depths of the netherworld.

The Purple Primordial Edict,
Extracts and pardons tormented spirits.
Countless generations without interruption,
Suffering ceases and purity prevails.

Severing and eradicating sinful karmas,
The talisman arrives—ascending to rebirth.
Swiftly, as the **Saviour of Suffering** (救苦天尊) decrees.
This talisman is the **True Essence of the Nine Heavens** (九天之真元),
The **Spiritual Treasure for Deliverance** (灵宝度人之炁),
Condensed into scripture,
As the **Book of Spirits Not Falling** (度魂不堕之书).

All who inscribe talismans must first assess the severity of the departed’s sins.
For those dying at the end of life,
Or from illnesses caused by non-karmic sins,
No need to proclaim this ritual.

For those who died by suicide or self-inflicted harm,
Or from **plague-epidemic illnesses** (疗疾瘟) or sudden misfortune,
This ritual may be proclaimed.

This talisman is specifically for **wrongful deaths** (不正死魂).
When inscribing, follow the established method.

First, face north,
And address the **Eastern Extremity** (东极).
Then, transform into the **Saviour of Suffering** (救苦真人),
Donning the **Pure One’s Crown** (上清冠),
Wearing the **Cloud and Dew Green Robes of the Dao** (云霞青法服),
Holding a **scroll** (简) as the **Heavenly Lord’s form** (若天尊之形).

Again, take the **Eastern Qi** (东炁) three breaths,
Turn back to face north,
And exhale the **White Qi** (白炁) three breaths over the paper and brush.

Imagine two **Green-robed Junior Attendants** (青衣童子) on either side,
Holding a **scroll of the True Red Script and Jade Characters** (赤书玉字真文) one roll,
One bearing the **Saviour of Suffering’s True Talisman** (救苦真符) before you.

Then recite the **Bitter Invocation of the Green Heavenly Dao** (青玄教苦诀),
Invoke the script,
And inscribe according to the established method.

When spirits behold this **True Script** (真文),
All shall be redeemed from sins and wrongs resolved.
The **Six Realms** (地狱) hearing it,
Shall naturally cease their torments.

**Proclamation Script:**
**Jade Treasury Yellow Edict for Extracting Sins Ritual Hall** (灵宝黄箓拔罪斋坛)
This hall, on the certain day of this month,
Has been solemnly proclaimed to the **Heavenly Province** (天省),
And to present **tribute scrolls and memorials** (拜贡章表),
Ascending to the **Golden Gates of the Three Heavens** (三天金阙).

We humbly petition for [Name] to be granted extraction and deliverance,
Requesting the descent of the **Primordial Origin’s Edict** (元始符命),
And the **Supreme True Talisman of Expiation and Reconciliation** (太上拔罪解冤真符).

To transcend and deliver [Name],
And all beings of the **Five Paths and Four Births** (五道四生),
Freeing them from the **netherworld’s depths** (冥涂),
Ascending them to the **Vermilion Palace** (朱府).

Thus, the talisman is proclaimed.
**Right Talisman is hereby offered.** (符 右奉)

**Edict of the Jade Emperor, Saviour of Suffering, Supreme Lord of Heaven:**

By imperial decree, the **Nine Hells** are opened, and the **suffering soul of [Name]**, burdened with unrighteous illness and sin, is pardoned and redeemed.

To the **Heavenly Prisons and Underworld Realms**, the **Boundless Divine Homeland**, the **Upper Primordial Star Domain**, the **Pala Prison**, the **Lower Ruined Yin-Du and Qu Curve**, the **Water Realm and Five Peaks Officials**, the **Ten Directions of the World**, the **Netherworld’s Shadowed Prisons and Gates of Darkness**, and all **wronged and suffering beings** with accumulated sins and afflictions:

Sever the **registers of guilt**, erase the **roots of malevolence**, and open the **dark gates of judgment**—let none be detained or coerced into demonic assemblies. Swiftly guide them toward rebirth, refine their essence, and purify their spirit, dispelling all obscurity. Let them ascend to the **Dao/Way** and attain **True Personhood**, as commanded.

**Heavenly Prison, Underworld Realms, the Three Realms of the Boundless Divine Homeland**
**Completion of the *Jade Treasury of Boundless Salvation* Supreme Scripture, Volume 56**
**Completion of the *Jade Treasury of Boundless Salvation* Supreme Scripture, Volume 57**
**Secret Precepts for Refining and Liberating**

The **Mysterious Master** says:
*"Of old, the **Supreme Sovereign** pitied the souls of the lower realms, confined and tormented in the northern **Minghai Sea**, the **Qu Curve’s Domain**, and the **Nine Abysses of Eternal Night**. There was no means for them to transcend.*

Thus, the **Scriptures** were proclaimed to liberate all beings. The **Nine-Petal True Person** was appointed to the **Upper Hall of Nanchang**, overseeing the **hosts of the departed** in the **Nine Abysses**. There was also the **Nanchang Lord of Degrees**, who refined and liberated the dead.

Within was the **Court of Flowing Fire**, its blazing radiance illuminating the eight directions. The **essence of Flowing Fire**, when applied to the body, made it glow like jade—clear as the pupil. The **Southern Polarity True Person** also presided in the hall, attending to all **aspirants** whose **Dao/Way** was incomplete. They were summoned to the **Flowing Fire Court**, where the **Southern Polarity True Person** refined them with **fire essence** and **lunar yellow qi**, washing away filth so they might consort with the **True Persons**.

For those whose **living forms** were being refined, their **souls and spirits** ascended directly to the **Southern Hall**, undergoing purification in the **Flowing Fire Court**. According to their **depth of cultivation** and **duration of practice**, when the allotted time was complete, they were reborn—though years might pass like a single sleep, unnoticed. From then on, they were destined for **immortality**.

The **sacred youth** of the **Fire Pool** was named **Poni**. Each time the **aeon** turned, he would gather the **multitudes of Tuqiu**, measuring their deeds to elevate them to the **Vermilion Mound Palace**, where they became **blessed officials**—no small merit.

When **Red Clarity** opened the **aeon**, the **Primordial Origin** bestowed the title of **Brahman Liberator King**. The **Supreme Non-Being True Person** then resided in the **King’s Palace**, liberating the **souls of eternal night**, dispatching them to the **Upper Hall of Nanchang**.

The **officials and attendants of the Vermilion Mound Fire Realm**, bearing **various seals**, descended to the mortal world, transmitting these methods to **worthy disciples** to act on Heaven’s behalf, rescuing those in the **Netherworld**.

Those who received this **Law** supplemented the **refining officials of the Nanchang Upper Hall**, also overseeing the **Yellow Edict Bureau**. This is the **refinement of spirit by spirit, of qi by soul**. All who practice this **Great Law** vow that on the **Three Pure Ones’ Day**, they will establish the hall to refine and liberate, so that **all souls of the Five Paths and Four Births**, stagnant in the **Three Realms of Suffering**, may transcend and be reborn in the **Heavens of Blessed Beings**, perpetuating their **meritorious deeds**.

**Unrefined souls**, before undergoing purification, are no taller than three *chi*, **limping, lame, or deformed**, their forms incomplete and stained with guilt. Only after refinement do they regain their **full shape**, their **filth dispersed**, their **grievances resolved**, and their **bodies radiant**.

When the refinement is complete, **burn the scriptures, offerings, treasures, talismans, and edicts**, entrusting them to the **soul**. The **Celestial Dao Functionary** carries the **official documents**, delivering them to the **Yellow Edict Bureau** for verification. The **three-lifetimes’ records of guilt** are examined, and all **false accusations against Heaven, slander of Earth, disloyalty as subjects, unfiliality as children, harm to living beings, and robbery of the virtuous** are expunged. The rest are judged according to their **karma**, swiftly granted rebirth, and spared further stagnation—thus fulfilling the **Supreme Sovereign’s benevolence toward life**.

---
**Secret Precepts of the Primordial Jade Treasury for Natural Nine-Heaven Transformation and Refining the Netherworld**

**Light incense, face east, and perform nine prostrations**, declaring the **ritual intent**.

Perform **nine more prostrations**, then sit upright, **regulating the spirit and harmonizing the qi**. Recite the **Precious Chapter of the Living Spirit** nine times. With each recitation, **draw in a breath of qi**, directing it straight to the **elixir field**.

Then **cultivate the Nine Qi**, circulating them through the body. In the **water palace within the body**, gather the **light of the Nine Qi** into a **childlike form** resembling yourself. The child faces outward, seated firmly, its light enveloping heaven and earth. The **form and spirit radiate brilliance**, and in moments, the **five zang-organs’ five-colored qi** rise like clouds from below.

Next, **carry the child** along the **double spinal pathway** into the **cinnabar field**, transforming it into a **rice-grain-sized precious pearl**. The child becomes the **Primordial Origin**, and the **five zang-organs’ cloud-like qi** become the **Lion**.

The **Primordial Origin** then **sits in meditation within the pearl**, atop the **five-colored Lion**, emitting **hundreds of millions of billions of radiant light**, illuminating all **heavens and earths**, penetrating their depths.

Next, **visualize the Thirty-Two Heavens’ myriad saints and true ones** ascending from the void, all entering the **precious pearl**. Before the **Primordial Emperor**, they kneel in reverence, as if listening to the **Law**.

When the assembly is complete, the **Primordial Origin** suddenly emits a **white hair auspicious light** from between the brows, descending to illuminate the **Nine Abysses of Yin-Du**, shining from the **cinnabar field** down to below the **navel**.

Within each light, a **precious pearl** appears. Within each pearl, the **Thirty-Two Heavens** and **myriad saints and true ones** accompany the **Primordial Origin**, identical to the first pearl.

Within each light, the **Saviour of Suffering** appears. Following the light into the **Nine Hells**, wherever the **Heavenly Lord’s power** reaches, the **sunlight** instantly shatters the **darkness**, dissolving the **heavily veiled**, transforming them into **pure lands**.

「Next, the two kidneys are preserved as the gates of the **Yin-Du Palace** (*酆都宫*), causing all the **Nine Hells** (*九幽诸狱*) to open. From the inner kidneys downward—what are called the **stomach and intestines** (*大小肠胃*)—are all abyssal and veiled, where **True Yang** (*真阳*) does not reach, and thus are the **Hells**.

Once the prison gates open, the **Northern Emperor** (*北帝*) and the myriad **Yin officials and jailers** (*诸冥官狱吏*) assemble in ranks outside the palace gates, behind the **Yin-Du Water Bureau** (*酆都水府*), before the **lumbar vertebrae and spine** (*腰脊骨*).

After the assembly concludes, the **Ten Directions’ Flying Celestial Kings** (*十方飞天神王*) arrive in chariots, with **Golden Boys** (*金童*) as attendants at their sides, holding the **Primordial Origin’s talismans and decrees** (*元始符命*). Facing the Emperor, they receive the **Dao’s edict** (*道旨*), then descend upon the light, entering the **Yin-Du Hells** to address all **guilty souls** (*罪魂*), granting them universal pardon—whereupon they exit the prisons and gather before the **Yin-Du Palace**.

Next, the **Flower Pool** (*华池*) is preserved as the **Forest of Retribution and Purification** (*森罗浄霐*).

Next, the **precious pearls** (*宝珠*) are preserved, and the **myriad saints and true ones** (*千真万圣*) recite in unison the **Heavenly River Sutra of the Eastern Well** (*天河灌东井咒*).

Next, the **Primordial Origin Emperor** (*元始上帝*) commands the **Red Dragon** (*赤龙*) to beat its drum, stirring the waves of the **Spiritual Pool** (*灵池*), causing the waters to cascade down like a waterfall into the **Eastern Well** (*东井*).

Swiftly, the **tongue** is preserved as the **Red Dragon**, churning the **Flower Pool** until the **divine waters** overflow. The dragon then looks left toward the throat and plunges straight into the **Water Bureau** before the palace.

This is the **Heavenly River**.

Next, the **boundless ocean before the Water Bureau** (*水府前大海*), without measure or edge, is preserved. All guilty souls enter to bathe, enveloped by auspicious winds and harmonious *qi*, warm as spring. The waters permeate their four limbs, and none fail to rejoice, instantly abandoning greed and anger, turning their hearts toward the **Dao**.

After bathing, the **Primordial Origin Emperor** decrees that the **Golden Boys and Jade Girls** (*金童玉女*) each carry **pure garments** (*浄衣*), countless in number, to bestow upon the guilty souls. Once they are clothed,

the **myriad saints and true ones** within the **precious pearls** chant in unison the **Great Sutra of the Saviour of Suffering** in **Mahābrahmā language** (*救苦经大梵语*).

Next, the **Supreme Unity Saviour of Suffering** (*太一救苦天尊*) and the **Ten Directions’ Saviour of Suffering** (*十方救苦天尊*) descend upon the **auspicious clouds** (*步景云*), reciting the sutra as they sprinkle the souls with **Nectar Law Water** (*甘露法水*), granting them instant **coolness of body and mind** (*身心清凉*) and **unblocked throat** (*咽喉开泰*).

The **Ten Directions’ Celestial Lords** each hold **golden basins and jade ladles** (*金盂玉匙*), filled with **Nectar Jade Ointment** (*甘露玉膏*), scattering and feeding the souls from the **void of emptiness** (*玄空*), offering them **sacred sustenance** (*法食*). All are sated to fullness.

Next, the **spine** is preserved as the **Great Law Bridge of Ascension** (*升天大法桥*), connecting to the **Crimson Terrace Palace** (*朱陵府*), the **Vermilion Palace** (*绛宫*), descending to the **Water Bureau**.

**Jade Boys and Jade Girls** (*玉童玉女*), holding **banners and flags** (*幢幡*), scatter **flying incense and blossoms** (*飞香散花*), guiding the **departed souls** (*亡魂*) onto the bridge and into the **Crimson Terrace Fire Bureau** (*朱陵火府*).

Within the bureau, the **Great Lord of Longevity** (*长生大君*) presides, with **Mars the Great God** (*司马大神*) as the **Emperor’s Attendant** (*帝王服*), **Star Official Han Jun** (*星官服韩君丈人*) as the **Chief of the Bureau**, and **White Jade Crowned Officials in Green and Black Robes** (*白玉冠青衣皂绿司命司录*) overseeing **Longevity Extension, Life-Prolonging Calculations, and Crossing Perilous Passes** (*延寿益算度厄*). The **Star Official** (*星官*) also serves as **Judge of Retribution** (*监度*), guiding the souls into the **Great Fire Pool** (*大火池*) for **fierce fire purification** (*猛火炼度*).

Once the souls undergo the fire trial, they are clad in **Heavenly Garments** (*天衣*). A **hundred thousand fire dragons** (*百千火龙*) leap from the fire pool atop flames, bearing the departed through **twelve layered pavilions** (*十二重楼*), ascending through the void until they reach the **Pure Jade Realm** (*玉清境*), where they kneel in homage before the **Primordial Origin Emperor**, their bodies merging into the **auspicious light** (*宝光*).

At that moment, their **Yin hearts** (*冥心*) are instantly purified, and they **forget both self and others** (*物我兼忘*), motionless in **tranquility** (*寂然不动*). No longer do they question where the departed souls reside—whether in **life or death** (*去住何地*).

If they linger even a thread, they cannot attain **ultimate fruition** (*究竟*), and thus have **no merit for transcendence** (*无缘超度*).

The **fire trial masters and officials** (*练渡师尊官吏*) conclude their rites.

In response to the **Supreme Ancestor of Southern Palace** (*南昌祖师至真官史*), a **Purification Hall** (*靖室*) is established. Devotees must **solemnly burn incense** at dawn and dusk, recite the **Middle Chapter**, and offer rites.

Moreover, they must **chant the Sacred Titles of the Pure Jade Realm Primordial Heavenly Lord** (*玉清圣境元始天尊*) and the **Supreme Saving-Suffering Heavenly Lord’s Title** (*太乙救苦天尊御号*), each **three hundred times**, and the **Jade Emperor’s Sacred Title** (*玉皇宝号*) **one hundred times**. May the **refinement of the departed souls** be swift, and their **rebirth in heaven** soon accomplished.

**Diligence must be maintained without slacking or neglect.** Thus concludes the **Fifty-Seventh Volume of the Supreme Scripture of Boundless Soul-Transcendence**.

**The Chapter on Living-Body Transcendence**

The Master said: The **Five Refining Methods of the Soul Treasure for Living-Body Transcendence** (*灵宝五炼生身受度*) are named the **Return-to-Truth Cavern-Mystery Jade-Marrow Supreme Secret Essentials** (*返真洞玄玉髓无上秘要*).

In ancient times, the **Soul Treasure Heavenly Lord** received the **secret precepts** from the **Primordial Heavenly Lord**, who entrusted them to the **Purple Palace Supreme One of the Nine Darknesses and Nine-Hua True Person** (*太一紫府太阴九华真人*), who then transmitted them to the **Southern Palace Soul-Commanding Lord** (*南昌度命君主*).

This doctrine originates from the **Great Possessing Palace** (*大有之宫*), where **gold is refined into script** and **jade is carved into volumes**, attended by **spirit-children** and **celestial consorts**. It governs the **stabilization of heaven and earth**, the **regulation of sun, moon, and stars**, and the **nurturing of all things**. It is the **ultimate source of all Dao**, the most **supreme and exalted**.

At the dawn of **Red Clarity** (*赤明*), the **Most High** observed how all beings suffered through **three karmas and six passions**, dying and falling into hells, sinking for **ten thousand kalpas** without hope of transcendence—**deeply lamentable**. Thus, the **Southern Pole Soul-Commanding Lord** was commanded to receive the **mysterious scriptures** and refine the **living body**, so that **guilt and obstacles would be purged**, and at the end of a hundred years, they would **not be seized by the underworld officials**, their bodies **emanating jade-light**, and they would **consort with True Persons**.

Thus, **Living-Body Transcendence** ensures **eternal existence across kalpas**, **cycling with the cosmic wheel**, and **equaling the lifespan of heaven**. Through **lingering transmission** from the **Lingering Case Jade Classics**, this doctrine gradually emerged among mortals—**ever more profound, ever more boundless**, known as **"transcending all, accomplishing all"**—how could it be called a **minor remedy**?

Those who practice this **Soul Treasure Great Method** must **neither harbor jealousy nor resentment**, treating all with **equal compassion and love**, regarding **differences as kin**. Their **Dao shall surely succeed**.

If one **violates these precepts**, calamity will befall the **seven ancestral generations**. **Beware! Beware!** Thus concludes the **Fifty-Eighth Volume of the Supreme Scripture of Boundless Soul-Transcendence**.

**Ritual Platform Construction**

**Method for Establishing the Platform**
Strike the teeth three times, then focus the spirit as the **Red Clarity Harmonious Yang Heavenly Sovereign**. Press the middle finger to the middle of the palm, recite the **Pure Heaven-Earth Spell**, and draw **qi from the southeast**.

Recite the spell:
*"Mixed and boundless, the crimson scripture—
No peer, the Most High True One.
From the Primordial Ancestor’s kalpa,
Born, the myriad heavens arise.
Opening the Three Brightnesses,
This is called the Heavenly Root.
Above, no further Ancestor—
Only the Dao is the body.
The Five Scriptures unfold,
Universally planting divine spirits.
Without scripture, no radiance—
Without scripture, no clarity.
Without scripture, no standing—
Without scripture, no completion.
Without scripture, no transcendence—
Without scripture, no birth."*

Upon completion, visualize within the five viscera five-colored luminosity emanating from the mouth, illuminating the celestial realm.

Next, visualize the platforms:
- **Eastern Platform**, the **Jade Yang Hall**, like an empty cavern, its **verdant light** dazzling as jade.
- **Southern Platform**, the **Flowing Fire Courtyard**, its flames blazing like the sun’s hue.
- **Western Platform**, the **Golden Flower Platform**, where **true qi** intermingles, gleaming gold and illuminating the ten directions.
- **Northern Platform**, the **Nine Refining Corpse Platform**, where **emerald qi** holds the **Spiritual Water Officials**; their waters mirror the Milky Way, within which five-colored flowing clouds drift.
- **Central Platform**, the **Great Yellow Platform**, where **true qi** permeates the **yellow qi**, surrounded by five-colored cloud radiance. Each platform has palaces, with officials in **three-colored brocade robes** encircling the five altars.

The platform is constructed with **pure sand**, thirty inches high, thirty-two inches wide—symbolizing the **Thirty-Two Heavens**. Thirty-two banners, each inscribed with the **Thirty-Two Heavens**, encircle it, with thirty-two lamps arranged around the four quarters, centering the **Three-Colored Realm Heavens**.

Each platform requires an incense burner, water, and fire, along with a wooden plaque bearing its name. Proceeding by the **Southern Dipper’s array**, draw qi step-by-step: first **water refining**, then the **eastern direction**, then **south**, **center**, **west**, and **north**, refining the form while maintaining visualization—**never breaking focus**—known as **Great Yellow Form-Refining**.

Next, perform **golden liquid quality-refining**:
- **East**: **Jade Yang Body-Returning**
- **North**: **Spiritual Water Purification**
- **Then**: **True Fire Transcendence**, each step following the method.

**Divine Transformation**
To transform into the **Red Clarity Harmonious Yang Sovereign**—the **Southern Pole Life-Commanding Lord**—press the middle finger to the middle of the palm, drawing **eastern qi**, assuming the form of the Celestial Lord.

Visualize **Taiyi the Saving-Suffering Heavenly Venerable** standing atop the head, the **Master of Eastern Hua** before you, **Han Lord** to your left, with countless divine generals surrounding you, acting at will.

**Divine Dispatch**
After transformation, raise the **Upper Purity Seal** with your left hand and loudly proclaim:
*"Officials of the Lingering Treasure Great Method, all ranks of refining and transcendence, assemble before me! Now, divine generals and officials—today, I summon the Celestial Functionary! Descend to the platform below and obey my command!"*

Upon their arrival, brandish the **Jade Purity Seal** and invoke the **Fiery Seal** to consume them.

**Jade Liquid Form-Refining Spell (East)**
*"Primordial Nurturing Child,
Inner perfection of the Law’s light.
Jade Field’s wheel ascends,
Transcending the Mysterious Yellow.
Bright without blemish,
Extended through the Nine Brightnesses.
As it is decreed, so it is done."*

**Great Liquid Form-Refining Spell (South)**
*"Red Clarity ascends,
True Tranquility radiant.
Secretly, the Lotus Glows,
Layered in the Void Hall.
Upright without deformity,
Blessed with Harmonious Yang.
As it is decreed, so it is done."*

**Golden Liquid Form-Refining Spell (West)**
*"Primordial Child opens,
True Radiance revealed.
Sacred Form settled,
No thought, no wildness.
Floating on the River, ascending cliffs,
Carrying the Great Yellow’s curve.
As it is decreed, so it is done."*

**Dark Liquid Form-Refining Spell (North)**
*"Abyssal Depths pierce the sky,
Dragon transformation ascends.
Ever-moving, ever-measured,
Fused into jade brilliance.
Wondrously nurturing refinement,
Blessing the Primordial Spirit.
As it is decreed, so it is done."*

**Great Yellow Form-Refining Spell (Center)**
*"Pure qi ascends,
Joyous, the Spirit Sage.
Descending into the Sacred Cavern,
Transformed into the True.
Preserving the True Bloom,
The Primordial Jade Body.
As it is decreed, so it is done."*

After completing the five platforms, **do not yet dismiss the seals**. Proceed to the **Fire Pool**, known as the **Flowing Gold Refining Fire Ritual**.

Visualize **midday solar precision light**, five-colored flowing clouds, illuminating the **Flowing Fire Courtyard**. Brandish the **Day Lord Seal** and recite:
*"Sovereign of the Sun,
Precision of the Solar Palace.
May true qi descend,
Infusing the form.
Molding soul, casting spirit,
Augmenting essence, refining spirit.
No evil obstructs the rectitude,
No darkness veils the clarity.
Form and spirit both perfected—
Thus, the True Person is attained.
The body receives transcendence,
Ascending to the Jade Courtyard.
As it is decreed, so it is done."*

Upon completion, visualize within the **Fighting Star’s light** a **purple qi**, as large as a child, glowing within the five colors, entering the fire.

Next, recite:
*"Solar Soul’s radiant scene,
Green-mirrored brilliance.
Returning crimson child,
Dark flames marking the symbol.
As it is decreed, so it is done."*

Draw a beam of solar light into the pool, visualizing within it the **Child of the Solar Field**, crowned with **Flying Heaven’s headdress**, clad in **Crimson Ridge Vermilion robes**, descending. Again, visualize within your **left eye** the **Solar Yang Lord**, uniting with the above into one, entering the pool. The solar light shimmers in five colors, both inside and out, all illuminated.

**Dismiss the Seals**, strike the teeth twenty-four times, and recite:
*"Yang Crystal now flows,
Flying Flowers renewed.
Imperial Radiance overflows,
Shading the inner coils.
Gazing upward at the Mysterious Nourishment,
Fragrance reaches perfection.
Palaces unfold,
Washing away the dust of clamor.
Reflecting jade light,
Golden visage emerges.
Soul ascends with Yu’s Step,
Ascending to the Solar Gate.
As decreed by the Solar Sovereign’s command."*

Strike the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, and gaze inward at the **golden light** emanating from the lungs, dispersing as **golden radiance**, meeting the fiery glow, illuminating the ten directions.

**Celestial Refining Seal**

Next, **store the luminous essence of the moon**—five-colored radiance flows, piercing into the **Divine Elixir** within. Invoke the **Moon Sovereign’s Formula** and recite:

*"Great Sovereign of the Celestial Yin, the essence of the Moon Palace,*
May **true qi** descend, perfusing my form.
**Soul and spirit** bound, **vitality and luster** harmonized.
Withered bones made supple, the parched made flourishing.
Form and spirit both refined, ascending to the **Jade Court** of loftiness.
As decreed by the Great Sovereign of the Celestial Yin’s command."*

When finished, within the light there is a **yellow qi**, vast as the **Pupil of the Moon**, its brilliance dazzling. The **moon’s spirit** radiates softly, its fragrance and splendor veiling the boundless void. The **ethereal orchid’s essence** blooms, and **luxuriant flowers** gather in clusters. **Pure gold shines with crystalline clarity**, its resplendent visage marking the **Celestial Platform**.

When finished, **extract one beam of moonlight** and merge it into the pool. Again, within the **moonlight’s radiance**, a **maiden of the moon’s reflection** appears—three inches and five *fen* in height, crowned with the **Seven-Star Progressing-Acumen Treasure** and clad in a **white silk flying skirt**, descending.

Then, within my own **right eye’s reflection**, another such maiden appears, her form identical. The two merge into one, following the light into the pool. The moonlight shimmers in five colors, both inside and out, all illuminated.

**Dismiss the Seals**, strike the teeth twenty-four times, and recite:

*"The yellow qi now flows, threefold essence condensed into light.*
**Mysterious radiance** returns to purity, the **eight-rayed crown** adorned.
Refined through the **Eastern Well**, receiving illumination to ascend in **yellow flight**.
**Golden flowers** disperse their spirit, the **Five Sovereigns’ essence** spreads fragrance.
The **Celestial Maiden** descends with **sacred wine**, sprinkling the ten directions.
**Abundant fragrance** descends, nourishing the **Six Palaces**.
**Golden essence** transforms in nine phases, **changing appearance** to restore its visage.
As decreed by the Great Sovereign of the Celestial Yin’s command."*

After reciting, take a beam of moonlight and blow it forth, strike the teeth three times, and visualize the **dark qi** in your kidneys surging upward into your heart, while the **red qi** in your heart descends—when the two qi meet, they transform into **jade light**, flowing from the **Celestial River’s waters** into the pool, making the water’s **jade light** radiant and clear.

**Water-Refined Seal** | **Gathering-Spirit Incantation**:
*"Primordial Cavern’s jade calendar, Dragon Han’s enduring prosperity.
Vast eons drift, within chaos’s womb.
Above, no hue remains; below, no abyss is left.
Wind and mist pierce the void, the **Diamond Vehicle** ascends to Heaven.
Heaven above, Heaven below—no shadow, no darkness.
Formless, shapeless, boundless, infinite.
The **Great Void’s** boundless Brahman, vast and luminous.
**Vermilion Clarity** unfurls its diagram, moving naturally by decree.
Swiftly, as the command is given."*

**Mixed Hundred Gods Incantation**:
*"Primordial Origin’s sacred mandate, gathering qi and condensing smoke.
Purple Void’s lush brilliance, aiding ten thousand immortals.
Swiftly, as the **Soul-Treasury Emperor’s** Mixed Hundred Gods decree."*

**Return-Form Restore-Nature Seal** | **Ingesting the Seal Incantation**:
*"Restore nature, return form—nine steps, eight trigrams.
Circulate the **Seven Starry Poles**, inner and outer both complete.
Three Platforms’ **Child-Midday**, the **Vermilion Palace** receives the True.
Qi-transformation is paramount, piercing the Primordial Truth.
Returning form alters essence, coming and going both flourish.
Heaven above, Earth below—piercing light, boundless clarity.
No more wheeling cycles, separation and union in **Upper Clarity**.
The **Celestial Person** declares: When the **Living Body** receives the **Passage**, one must face the **Heavenly True** to give thanks, bowing twice eastward. Wearing this seal’s inscription ensures one never falls into the **Wheel of Rebirth**.
The method is written on thin yellow paper with cinnabar ink.
For **Passing the Dead**, also use yellow paper with cinnabar ink during alchemical refining."*

**Primordial Emperor’s Seal of Severing Death and Ascending Life**:
*"Primordial Emperor’s decree, pardoning sins and absolving faults.
Severing enmity, reconciling bonds—severing death, ascending life.
Names inscribed on golden tablets, ranks listed on jade stairs.
True light guides, benevolent grace unfurls.
Golden lotus bears the steps, purple qi crosses the pass.
Three transformations, nine refinements—returning form, renewing visage.
The **Three Heavenly Demon Kings** recommend the ascended immortal.
True heart pierces clarity, wisdom and fortune arise naturally.
Attending the **Dragon Chariot’s** court, receiving qi for eternal life—just as the decree commands."*

**Severing Death and Ascending Life Incantation**:
*"Life upon life gains the Emperor’s heart, named in the **Double Door’s** inner hall.
Purple Chamber blends the Five Spirits, soul and essence ever noble.
Seven Passes receive immortal radiance, Five Visceras’ elemental qi.
All pass through Water, Fire, and Heaven—cloaked in the Four Harmonies’ splendor.
Ascending to the **Celestial One’s Son**, facing the myriad souls.
Swiftly, as the Emperor’s decree."*

After reciting, burn the seal along with the **Five Elders’ Alchemical True Texts**.
The **Celestial Person** declares: When the **Living Body** undergoes refining, one must obtain the **Severing Death and Ascending Life Seal** to merge with the **Great Void’s virtue**, extending life and years.
The method uses a **paulownia wood** tablet, nine inches long, two *fen* thick, and two inches four *fen* wide, painted with indigo as the base, with cinnabar ink for the text and characters. Store it in a green silk pouch, then burn it together with the **Two Heavenly Vouchers**.

**The *Soul-Treasury’s Limitless Passage for Mortals* Scripture’s Great Method, Volume Fifty-Eight, concludes.**
**The *Soul-Treasury’s Limitless Passage for Mortals* Scripture’s Great Method, Volume Fifty-Nine.**

**The Three Lights Refining and Transcending Chapter**

The Celestial Person declares: To transcend the netherworld, one need not perform the **Southern March Ritual**—merely using the **Three Lights Seal** and refining with their **qi** suffices, for this is also called the **Soul-Treasury’s Natural Limitless Transcendence for Mortals**.

First, face the Sage and burn incense, offering three obeisances and invoking blessings. Prepare the ritual position, stating one’s surname and given name. I humbly hear that **Primordial Origin** unfolded the diagram, originating from **Nature’s single qi**. The **Crimson Court** decreed fate, its laws emanating from the **Three Heavens**. Responding to phenomena, it assumes form and varies with circumstances, manifesting the **Red Scriptures** of the **Out-of-the-World**, and bestowing the **Jade Calendar** to transcend mortals.

Thus, the **Soul-Treasury** established the **Sacred Fast**, and the **Cavernous Mysteries** expounded the teachings. Though its paths may seem circuitous as the **Tempest Chariot**, its blessings extend universally to all auspiciousness. It is fitting to spread **virtue** across the **Netherford**, ensuring all receive equal grace in transcendence.

I respectfully petition:
- The **Supreme Sovereign of the Left Palace of the Celestial Metropolis**, the **Sun Lord of the Solar Midheaven**, the **Illuminating and Mysterious Sage of the Jade Flower**, the **True Person of the Great Light**, the **Scattering Radiance Boy of the Great Light**,
- The **Supreme Sovereign of the Right Palace of the Celestial Metropolis**, the **Moon Lord of the Lunar Midheaven**, the **Stone Mirror Water Mother of the Royal Flower**, the **Flowing Light Lady**, the **Round Light Scattering Radiance Boy**,
- The **Southern March Crimson Palace’s Refining Light True and Upright Lord**, the **Nine Flowers Transcending Chapter’s Opening Light**, and all **True Saints** who transcend and liberate all beings.

I humbly pray that the **Three Lights** unite, illuminating the **Double Darkness** with sentience. Refining all classes, I demonstrate the **Limitless Transcendence** without bounds. I invoke the **Heavenly Worthy of Universal Luminosity**.

Next, hold the **Clear Water Lamp** and recite the incantation:
*"The Crimson Furnace’s Dan landscape, the Round Flower’s Nine Brilliances.
The Great Radiance dawns, the Vermilion Essence shines resplendent.
The Five Emperors summon the mist, illuminating ten thousand lives.
The Upper Expanses open—True, the **Heavenly Conditions** are level.
The **qi** circulates, refining form; the Five Phases disperse, my spirit transforms.
The Six Palaces flourish with honor.
Aligned with the Imperial Worthy, the **Great One** without flaw.
Riding the Vermilion Clouds, the Solar Fire as a palanquin.
Ascending to the Solar Midheaven, merging with the Emperor’s spirit.
Life equals Heaven and Earth; the Two Dawns incline together, uniting with the **Dao’s Truth**."*

Then burn the seal over the lamp and immerse it in water. Invoke the **Nine-Light Refining and Transcending Heavenly Worthy**.

Next, hold the lamp and water, reciting:
*"The Yellow Essence sets motion in play, the Primordial Yin reveals its chapters.
Gazing upon the Great Mysterious, opening ten thousand paths.
Dispersing the Cold Gale, the Seven Dawns hang with lingering luster.
The Triple Yin converges; Heaven and Earth emit light.
The Purple Radiance drifts, the Floating Flowers fill the Nine Skies.
The Round Brilliance bestows hues; the Six **qi** harmonize.
The Five Empresses command the clouds, drawing the wind.
The **Soul-Canopy** of **Yùluó** adorns them, with **jewel pendants** at their sides.
Feathered skirts brush the heavens; cloud-fans wave to the east.
The **Yánshù** trees spread dawn; their branches flourish like **peng** grass.
The Cloud Curtains polish the **Mùwang**; nurturing the **Wood Sovereign**.
The Cavernous Roots stretch ten thousand *li*; their mists shade my person.
Soul and spirit harmonize; the Six Mysterious **qi** fill with vitality.
Returning to the Primordial, the Jade reflects—reborn as a child.
The Emperor’s **virtue** merges; the palanquin’s scene is **Táokāng**.
At the appointed hour, riding the **Flowing Bell**, ten dragons ascend the clouds.
Ascending to the Lunar Palace, Heaven and Earth are boundless."*

Then burn the seal over the lamp and immerse it in fire, holding both lamps together. Invoke the **Heavenly Worthy of the Dan Realm’s Refining Fire**.

Proclaim the **Great Refining and Subduing Demon Incantation**:
*"The Three **qi** pervade the **Spiritual Gate**; the Illuminated Soul shines with the Jade Dan.
The Crimson Court holds the **True Ones**; the Flowering Clouds fly in Vermilion Palanquins.
Commanding all ten thousand realms, nurturing and transcending billions.
Holding the **strategies**, recording the **scrolls**, unfolding the **Divine Chapters**.
Severing bonds, dissolving the roots of calamity; molten gold crushes malevolent deceit.
If one’s resolve achieves this **Way**, demons dare not approach.
Protecting and transcending the **Netherford’s Effort**, gazing endlessly without bound."*

Then burn the seal over the two lamps and immerse it in water. Next, hold the lamp and ignite the **Fire Pool**, pouring water into the **Water Pool**. Invoke the **Great Transcending Heavenly Worthy of the Law Bridge**.

If the **Southern March Refining and Transcending Method** is used, proceed with the **Ritual**. If using the **Three Lights Refining and Transcending**, omit it.

Next, summon the departed soul before the Sage and offer incense. Then proclaim the **Refining Ritual of the Fire Palace Boy**:
*"I hear the **Cold Court** confines them, now pondering the **Mysterious Mercy** of transcendence.
The **impure qi** blooms like flowers—truly relying on the **Law-Water** to purge and dispel.
Thus, the Heavenly Worthy, moved with pity, the **Great Dao**’s compassionate benevolence, drenching all beings, rescuing them from suffering.
Unveiling the **Essentials of the Cavernous Mysteries**, bestowing the **Clear Rituals of Refining and Transformation**.
So they may bathe in the **Spiritual Ford**, ascending beyond the **Desire Realm**.
Then form and spirit both attain perfection; blessings and congratulations naturally arise.
You souls, pure and reverent, receive the refining with sincerity."*

Next, recite the **Refining the True Incantation**:
*"The Supreme High True One, the Nine Spirits’ Essence.
Make the soul fly as a **Xian**, ascending to the **Purple Court**.
Bathing in the Flowering Pool, body and spirit purified.
The **Essence** penetrates the **Great Void**; ten thousand **qi** spontaneously arise."*

Next, recite the **East Well Incantation**:
*"The **Heavenly River** irrigates the **East Well**; the **Stone Mirror Water Mother’s** essence.
The Round Light brushes the **Spiritual Luster**; the **Mysterious Luster** gleams high and bright.
**Primordial Origin** parts the **Double Night**; mortals and immortals give birth to the **Moon**.
Bathing in the **Lan Pool** above, the **Dragon** bears the **Longcheng Vessel**.
The **Golden Boy** scatters fragrant flowers; the **Jade Maiden** flows the Five Stars.
Donning the **Jade Girdle**, refining the Five **Xian** forms.
The **Perfumed Body** descends with ten thousand spirits; riding the **Scenery**, ascending to the **High Bright**."*

Next, invoke:
*"Souls and spirits, one **qi** blending, the Three Lights piercingly clear—no darkness remains unilluminated, the **Way** manifests in the seal.
Only hearing the **Suffering Sea’s** waves rise, the **Karmic Wind** fanning flames—
the accumulated **ignorance** of beginningless crimes—how could one encounter such **resplendent grace**?
Unwashed by dust, no hope of transcendent wisdom.
Today, I follow the **Primordial Origin’s** Dao edict, extending the **Sovereign’s** benevolence,
requesting the **True Fire** of the Three Lights to transcend the **Nine Layers of Darkness**.
You must take the **Great Vow**: to eliminate all **greed, hatred, and evil deeds** from beginningless time,
to cultivate a **pure body and mind** from today onward,
to sever the **Seven Emotions** across all **dust-sands and eons**,
to take **refuge in the Three Jewels** in all lifetimes and births.
All through the **Liberation Path**, entering the **Land of Effortless Wandering**.
We, the **Law Assembly**, share this resolve—
together with the souls, we sincerely turn toward it."*

Finally, chant the **Praise of the Dao Treasure**.

「Thus, the Dao/Way, formless and nameless, manifests through symbols and reveals itself,
moves with the sun and moon, encompasses heaven and earth—
effortless yet all-pervading, its essence ever-present in all things.
It is the mystery of all existence, the treasure of the virtuous,
the refuge of those who return, the revered Dao Treasure.»

**Next, the Praise of the Scripture Treasure:**
«The Jade Classics inscribed with seals, the Golden Tablets with luminous script,
eight-cornered and radiant, a square span of a thousand measures,
thirty-six divisions, five thousand precepts in four grades—
the Dao/Way bridges the Three Vehicles.
We reverently honor the Scripture Treasure.»

**Next, the Praise of the Teacher Treasure:**
«All beings in ignorance must be guided by instruction.
The Ten Directions’ sea of suffering requires the ferry of the Law.
We vow to establish the lineage of teachers,
to lead all to the true fruit of enlightenment.
With respectful homage to the Law Body,
we reverently honor the Teacher Treasure.»

**Threefold Homage and Praise:**
«Now, for the souls and all beings,
we take refuge in the Three Jewels.
We vow that in response to the call of the Ten Directions,
and in the Three Ages’ transformations,
all celestial beings, immortals, and gods of blessed lands,
the Ten Extremes’ demon kings,
and the countless holy assemblies—
they shall seek our voice to save suffering,
respond to our compassionate light,
and be guided away from confusion.
Together, we return to the unity of the Original Qi,
and restore the True Essence of the Primordial Origin.
The divine transformations know no bounds,
mutually blending, each perfecting in wondrous wisdom,
free from obstruction—
the radiance of sun and moon,
the brilliance of stars—
all arise from divine light,
fulfilling the merit of refinement and transcendence.
Having opened the gate of alchemy and liberation,
we now expound the profound mysteries—
you must quietly contemplate,
and deeply receive the Jade Precepts.»

**Next, chant the Nine Chapters,
then chant the Three Lights’ Alchemy of Refining the Jade Scripture Treasure Chapter.**

«The brilliance spreads wide and high,
illuminating the Original Void.
In response to the Nine Primordial Truths,
the transformations merge with the Great Diagram.
The Celestial Spirit constructs the text,
following the Dao’s sacred model.
The Tortoise of the West, the Dragon’s Head,
the Wind’s Dew and the Communal Hall—
all are transformed and unified,
their majesty self-evident.
The sun’s essence fills the heavens,
the moon’s shadow aligns with the earth.
The stars’ essence nurtures the alchemy,
the souls and spirits ever supported.
The Celestial Forest radiates authority,
reaching beyond existence into non-being.
The demon kings are subdued,
the Three Scenes free from constraint.»

**Then, the White Cloud says:**
«Indeed, the Four Births are mired in delusion,
the Six Realms steeped in darkness.
We refine the Three Qi in the Three Lights,
and gaze upon the Nine Yang in the Nine Dao.
The palaces of soul and spirit,
the ears and eyes, the vital essence—
all must now be transformed,
so that the divine may migrate and receive the alchemy.»

**Next, chant the Five Celestial Beings’ Scripture of Refining and Subduing Demons.**

«The Original Void radiates the Primordial Essence,
the Green Flower opens the Great Clarity.
The Red Flower dispels the Three Qi,
the Jade Pill nourishes the Celestial Spirit.
The Western Spirit returns the Seven Degrees,
the Great Void’s brilliance shines like a mirror’s bloom.
The Northern Mystery’s Three Refined Mists,
the Supreme Sovereign’s Purple Emperor’s True Essence.
The transformations merge into the Peak of Unity,
the Original Sovereign’s spirit encompasses all.
The demon kings are bound to the blood sacrifice,
the dead are recorded in the names of the living.
The Five Assemblies unite in one vow,
the Central Lord, the Great Arcane Sovereign.
The Wind’s Chariot serves as the subjugation,
all equally receive the ascending Green Qi.»

**Again, the White Cloud says:**
«Souls and all beings,
when you reach the altar,
whether scholar, farmer, artisan, or merchant,
whether kin, friend, or stranger,
whether father, mother, uncle, or elder brother,
whether elder sister, younger brother, or younger sister,
whether husband, wife, son, or daughter,
whether distant or near,
whether wise or foolish—
arranged by rank and ability,
distinguished by virtue—
then, according to their stations,
a thousand differences arise.
Yet, in this moment, the noble and the destitute are equal,
the wise and the foolish are the same.
For the heart is bound by its own divisions,
the spirit not yet extinguished—
still clinging to distinctions of high and low,
still harboring the hunger of suffering.
From ignorance, they have not heard the true teachings.
Now, through this instruction,
let them cleanse their delusions.

This Sacred Fast of the Spirit is the Primordial Sovereign’s supreme transformation—
returning to the Origin, achieving unity,
preserving the True and embracing the Spirit.
We must abandon all attachment to forms,
and enter the realm of boundless liberation.
Quietly return to boundless vision,
severing all mundane thoughts.
In profound stillness, the divine is born,
listening closely to the hidden melodies.
All true beings witness and verify the refinement.»

**Next, chant the Great Dharma’s Hidden Language,
then recite the second vow:**

«Indeed, the Ten Categories sink their souls,
long steeped in the realms of darkness.
The Three Lights’ true Qi joins in the alchemy’s work.
Having transformed the substance into Yang Crystal,
the divine now dwells in the Jade Scripture.
Born with fortune, do not return to delusion—
purified of all dust, forever gaining the unique treasure.

We vow that all true beings shall witness and verify the refinement,
the holy assemblies list in compassion.
May the virtuous nature, firm and unyielding,
ascend directly to the Immortal Realm,
untested by demons, entering the Celestial Gate.
Guiding the Spirit Consorts with compassion,
the Five Assemblies open the path of salvation.
Observing the fate of the child,
the Golden Dragon’s relay transmits the decree.»

**When the rites are complete, proclaim the Left Decree,
and chant the Hidden Names of the Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns.**

**Next, proclaim the Right Decree,
and chant the Three Chapters of the Demon Kings,
then proclaim the Seal of Receiving Precepts.**

**The Sovereign’s True Form, the Jade Character:**
«The incantation reads:
*‘Scarlet Red, the Supreme Vermilion,
resplendent and solemn.
The true essence of Yang Qi,
purifying impurities in the Pool of Brilliance.’*»

**The Great Yin’s True Form, the Jade Character:**
«The incantation reads:
*‘Pure Round Jade Light,
ascending mysteries in celestial knots.
The luminous fusion of Yin essence,
nurturing souls and refining forms.’*»

**The Heavenly Ganges’ True Form, the Jade Character:**
«The incantation reads:
*‘The Ganges’ stars’ true Qi,
entwining sinews and encircling bones.
Piercing the muddy elixir,
opening the Yang’s towering peaks.’*»

**The Eight-Character Talisman of the Great Sun:**
*‘Scarlet Red, the Supreme Vermilion,
the Yang Essence refines the souls.’*

**The Eight-Character Talisman of the Great Yin:**
*‘Jade Light, the Mysterious Brilliance,
the true essence nourishes the spirits.’*

**The Six-Character Talisman of the Celestial Manifestation:**
*‘The Ganges’ stars’ true Qi refines the souls.’*

**These Three Lights’ Jade Talismans**
are answered to the Heavenly Sovereign’s decree,
written upon the Vermilion Peak’s Celestial Palace,
to receive the refining of the departed souls.»

**The Scripture *Soul Gem of Boundless Degrees* concludes in Volume 59 of the Great Dao.
The Scripture *Soul Gem of Boundless Degrees* concludes in Volume 60 of the Great Dao.**

**The Chapter on Receiving Refining in Nanchang (The Scripture *Soul Gem of Boundless Degrees*):**
*"The Imperial Sage declares: To receive refining of the departed souls, one must follow the original methods of the *Soul Gem*. First, one should go before the Holy Sage, burn incense, and recite silently. Then, seated in proper order, one invokes the ritual.

‘Here, the humble servant [name], having now burned incense, humbly petitions:
The Three Pure Ones, Supreme Sages,
The Ten Directions’ High Worthies,
The Great One of the Saving-Suffering Celestial Sovereign,
The Heavenly Pivot of the Three Provinces,

The Celestial Worthies of the Yellow Banner Hall,
The Officials and Envoys of Merit,

The Nine-Light Child Immortals,
The Dragon-Wen Deities of the Eight Auras,
The Fire Pool Divine Generals,

And all True Worthies.

*Humbly, we pray that the Cloud-Flying [Deity] descend temporarily from the Vermilion Celestial Heights,*
*and that the Feathered Chariot circle and descend upon the Dao-Realm.*
*With the Five Colors vibrant and the Compassionate Light pervading,*
*illuminating the Dark and Profound.’*"

The Four Symbols exhale their vast influence,
And the benevolent grace pervades the black earth.
Thus, may Your servant be granted enlightenment,
To rescue and uplift the lost souls.

Now, we humbly beseech Your boundless compassion,
To serve as eternal witness and testament.

Issuing the Soul-Calling Talisman,
Reciting the Hidden Names,
Invoking the Golden Threshold Transformed Body Celestial Worthy,
And conjuring the departed soul to stand before the tribunal.

We humbly reflect:
The heavens and earth bestow their nurturing virtue without favor,
And all things are born from this boundless generosity.
Yin and Yang govern the sources of fortune and calamity,
And must respond in kind to human deeds.

If one commits a single act of injustice,
Or performs a single unkind deed,
Though the world may not yet condemn them in life,
In the unseen realm, they cannot escape the ghosts’ reproach.

Thus, whether man or woman,
Commoner or official,
Serving their ruler or their parents,
Leading others or governing themselves—
If they defy the natural order of Heaven and Earth’s creation,
And ignore the radiance of the Three Lights’ illumination,
Failing to exhaust their loyalty in service to the state,
Or to deplete their filial piety at home,
Yet indulge in arrogance, excess, lust, and idleness,
Disregarding reverence and frugality,
Or flatter and scheme while abandoning the Middle Way,
Practicing deceit, envy, and malice,
While righteousness goes unheard,
And cruelty and murderous acts stand unchecked by benevolence and forgiveness—
Slanderous tongues twist truth into falsehood,
Partiality and malice defame the virtuous,
And those who covet honor and wealth
Lightly dismiss merit while greedily hoarding gains,
Or extort bribes, taking without measure while hiding excess.

They know not the origin of their very essence and breath,
Nor trace the source of their sustenance.
Abusing authority, they weigh justice lightly,
And wielding power, they act with tyranny.
They never take refuge in the Three Treasures,
Nor pity the Fourfold Birth,
Blaspheming the Dao and reviling their teachers,
Oppressing others and scorning all things,
Cursing and poisoning, openly deceiving,
Studying scriptures with doubt,
And scoffing before the deities,
Feasting on unclean foods without restraint,
Ignoring the rites of fasting and purification.
Their incense unburned, how could they offer sincere devotion?

All these transgressions are the seeds of Hell,
The causes of delusion across dust-swept kalpas.
Yet they cling to self-interest, believing in eternal life,
Until the Five Phases exhaust their measure,
And the Great Limit draws near.
Then, summoned by the grave’s accusations,
Confronted by vengeful spirits,
Plagued by misfortune and disease,
They perish in untimely death or childbirth,
Or suffer endless torment in the underworld,
Haunted by sorrow in eternal darkness.
Though time passes like a fleeting stream,
They remain bound by the karmic trials of rebirth.
How much more so for those yet unborn—
Even if they wish to reform, there is no path.

Unless they take refuge in the Three Realms’ Supreme Danheaven Emperor,
The Vermilion Mound Fire Office,
And the Refining Clarity Worthy,
Who alone knows the Dao’s compassion for life,
And rescues the utmost suffering of the deluded.

Now, the departed soul—[Name]—
Though once dwelling in the dusty world,
Still bound by mortal form,
Has not escaped the shame of past deeds.
Thus, through body, speech, and mind,
Greed, hatred, and delusion arise.
Though past transgressions may be many,
Redemption lies in this very moment.

From the Three Realms’ torment,
To the Nine Layers’ imprisonment,
All are saved by devotion,
And attain liberation.

With reverence, we recall the Great Luo Yuanbeginnings’ Sacred Treasure Compassionate Worthy,
Who manifested in the Dragon and Han eras with boundless virtue,
And revealed the jade-like clarity of their vision.
They expounded the vast and profound merits of countless kalpas,
And bestowed the towering virtue of the Great Brahman.

They inscribed the Five Scrolls in the Azure Palace,
And fully saved all sentient beings.
They hung the Eight Trigrams in the Vermilion Mound,
And guided all ranks to transcendence.
Thus, the dead souls undergo refining,
And attain the transformation into immortals.

Now, with the Crimson Script’s luminous ancestral *qi*,
We command the Nine-Light Child Immortals,
And the Refining Clarity Worthy,
To summon the lost souls,
And forge them in the flowing fire.
Thus, grudges shall be extinguished,
And karmic stains shall dissipate like smoke,
Ascending to the Vermilion Palace,
And their names inscribed in the Purple Register.

At this hour, we solemnly follow the Great Law,
The Refining Souls Ritual,
And reverently perform its observances,
Humbly praying for divine response.

Again, we offer incense,
And invoke the Ten Directions’ Saving-Suffering Celestial Worthy,
Holding the Yuanbeginnings’ Talisman.

Your servant has heard:
The Sacred Treasure Original Chapter
Pursues and refines the departed,
Ten times refining souls,
Nine times concealing the underworld’s melodies,
Opening natural enlightenment,
And descending through the void to manifest spirits,
Governed by the Three Primordials’ symbols.

The Jade Palace Great Saint,
High above the imperial throne,
Expounds the utmost mysteries,
And examines the causes and conditions.

The Yuanbeginnings’ Talisman descends,
Dragging souls from hidden prisons,
And universally saves all beings,
Refining ancestors and descendants alike.
Ascending to the Vermilion Palace,
They urgently inform the Three Officials,
The Mountain and Marsh Spirit Caverns,
And the Twelve River Sources,
To pardon and absolve all offenses,
Without delay.
A grand assembly is convened in the Mysterious Capital,
And all gods are swiftly summoned.

Among them:
The Eastern Pole Palace’s Responsive-Sensation Supreme One Saving-Suffering Celestial Worthy,
The Soul-Refining Transformed Form Lord,
The Great God of the Great Darkness’ Corpse-Refining,
The Great Compassionate Miao Conduct Worthy,
The Heavenly Mechanism Benevolent Life File-Chang,
The Life-Prolonging Fortune-Increasing Calamity-Removing Worthy,
The Soul-Summoning Mysterious Capital,
The Infinite Soul-Refining,
Today’s Record-Keeping,
All the Celestial Lords attending the hall.

We humbly invoke the Ten Directions’ Mighty Dragon Gods,
The Radiant Flower Gods,
The Dark Hero Gods,
The Refining Gods,
The Transformed Body Gods,
The Repaired Form Gods,
The Rectified Essence Gods,
The Fire Office Gods,
The Returned Form Gods,
The Returned Soul Gods,
The Transcendent Life Gods,
Their light shining brightly,
Illuminating all the heavens.

The Celestial Prime Minister,
The Immortal Lord Tao Gong,
Holding the talismans and registers,
All assemble before the Emperor,
Universally refining all beings,
And the souls of past lives.
By imperial decree, the Ghost Emperor is summoned,
To hear the teachings.

The Yan Capital’s Underworld Officials,
The Censorate Attendants,
Each holding the Black Registers,
Shall strike down the roots of guilt,
And not dare detain or oppress the ghostly multitudes.

All Yuanbeginnings’ Talismans are now sealed and activated.

Your servant, with utmost humility, prays thus.

Reciting the Supreme One Saving-Suffering Celestial Worthy,
Holding the Refining Souls Talisman,
And offering incense.

Your servant has heard:
The Eternal-Life Great Saint,
The Flying Celestial God-King,
At the dawn of the Red Clarity era,
When the Green of the Primordial began in the heavens,
And the mountains swallowed smoke,
They received the Sacred Treasure’s hidden melodies.

The ghostly spirits now perish and disperse,
As the wondrous *lingzhang* hymns resound,
Reviving the dead and restoring the decayed,
Manifesting the *Zhenren*’s virtue in guiding souls.
Seeking voices and responding to yearnings,
They follow wishes to be reborn.

With utmost humility, I beseech the Eternal-Life Great Saint,
The Flying Celestial God-King,
To bear the *Yuanbeginnings’* talismans and decrees,
And pardon the guilty souls of the Northern Capital.

Thus may the departed *Certain Person* escape demonic control and be exalted,
Ascending in due time.

Attendants and escorts shall all be counted among those refined by the day.
Roaming the *Jieyan* Platform of the blade-effigies,
They attain the fruit of *Dongxuan*’s mysteries,
Without passing through the underworld,
Directly ascending to the Southern Palace.

Free from the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships, they wander at ease,
Offering homage to the Nine Ancestors and Seven Mystics in joy.
May they be unbound by constraints,
And fully fulfill the *Xuanke*’s sacred rites.
Your servant, with deepest reverence, prays thus.

Reciting the *Huolian Danjie* Celestial Worthy of the Fire-Refined Elixir Realm.

With fervent hope, I pray the Flying Celestial God-King,
And the divine officials and soldiers,
As in the past when the Primordial Green dawned in the heavens,
Within the *Lihuafahuo* assembly,
May they not forget the teachings of the *Yuanbeginnings* Celestial Worthy.

With deepest humility, I pray for the salvation of the departed *Certain Person*,
That their dead souls may be refined,
Transformed into immortals and reborn as humans,
Their living bodies delivered from suffering,
And eternal life granted through each eon.
All sentient beings shall ascend to the Dao’s shore.

Reciting the *Zhuling Duming* Celestial Worthy of Commanding Life,
Offering incense,
With middle fingers inscribed,
Summoning the *Shenshi* divine historians.

With solemnity, I summon:
The Left Marshal of the *Dantian* Celestial Army,
The *Zhiri* Functionary of the Sun,
The *Didao* Functionary,
The *Huanglu* Academy Functionary,

The Chief Clerk of Soul-Pursuit,
The Functionary of Soul-Gathering,
The General of Soul-Capture,
The Messenger of Soul-Refinement,
The Fire-Pool Water-Marsh Divine Generals,
The Fire-Oven Divine Soldiers,
The Generals of the Refinement Bureau,
To come and fulfill their duties at the altar.

With reverence, I follow the Dao’s decree,
Refining and guiding the dead souls.
You divine powers shall act accordingly.

The Five Dao Masters of *Taishan*,
The City Deities and their overseers,
The Underworld officials and soul-guiding clerks,
Swiftly and respectfully obey the original pardon,
Summoning the departed *Certain Person*
To appear before the altar for refinement.

Reciting the *Liandu Nan Gong* Celestial Worthy of Southern Palace Refinement.

First, I invoke the *mao* character of the left hand—*Yundou Gongcheng* complete,

Then extract the southeast *qi* to refine the departed soul,
And begin the *ti* incantation, followed by the *lun* incantation,
Silently reciting the *Gou Shen* incantation.

Transforming the Five Emperors’ talismanic incantations, I intone:
*"Qingdi"* protects the soul, safeguarding the Three Palaces.
Invoking the *zhen* character—*Hongxing*,
Absorbing the nine channels of eastern green *qi* into the mouth,
Channeling my own liver *qi* ninefold into the mouth to merge,
And strike the talisman with the incantation.

*"Chidi"* nourishes *qi*, with all spirits returning to the body.

Absorbing the three channels of southern red *qi* into the mouth,
Channeling my own heart *qi* threefold into the mouth to merge,

Channeling my own spleen *qi* twelvefold into the mouth to merge,

Ji ji ru lvling."*

Next, I recite the Fire Incantation three times,
Transforming the *Rizhun* talisman.
Upon completion, I direct the divine generals
To lead the departed soul to the Fire Pool for refinement of its form.

Again, I recite the Fire Incantation three times,
Then the *Yinyu* incantation once,
And within the Fire Pool, I burn the *Liujin Lianxing* talisman.
Burning the talisman with the incantation:

*"Yangming Jingjing, Huo Fan Ziting.

Next, I burn the *Jiuchang* talisman of the twelve paths,
Then the *Shier Shenjiang* talisman.
Upon completion, I command the divine generals
To lead the departed soul to the Water Marsh for refinement of its form.
Again, I recite the incantation three times,
And the *Yi Yu* incantation once,
Burning the *He Xing* talisman within the Water Marsh.

Now the departed soul, [Name], has bathed its impure form in the Bright Pool,
Refining its essence through the flowing fire—
All defilements are swept away.
The five turbid impurities of the body are now utterly purified.
No demon dares to offend; the body radiates luminosity.

Now, with reverence, I approach the altar,
To receive the sprinkling of the Sweet Dew,
And partake in all virtues,
Thus achieving transcendence and rebirth.

I recite the *Fa Yu* Sutra to shower universal blessings upon the Heavenly Worthy.

Next, the *Hosting of Past Lives* Praise:
*"Alas, the long night of suffering,
Bound in torment within the Three Realms.
Fiery flames choke the throat,
Hunger and thirst for eternal life.
One sprinkling of Sweet Dew rain,
Like cool relief in scorching heat.
The spirit and soul are reborn in the Great Net,
Nourishing all beings."*

Next, I recite the *Heavenly Qi* Incantation:
*"The heavens clear, the qi refined—
Five hues shine resplendent.
The sun and moon emit their radiance,
Purifying the body’s form.
The divine elixir washes within,
Perfumed waters refining the essence.
Luminous brilliance flows and shines,
Illuminating the High Clarity.
The qi resists no evil,
The five viscera receive their spirits.
Guilt vanishes from the Three Realms,
Calamities dissolve in the Nine Darks.
Evil roots are severed,
Fortune and blessings arise anew.
Today’s great vow—
All oaths are fulfilled.
Universal enlightenment is granted,
Ascending to the Imperial Court."*

Next, I issue the talismans and seals,
Combining and elevating the ritual documents.

I humbly declare that the departed soul has long been lost in eternal night,
Forever severed from the sun’s light.
Now, I, [Name], recall the departed across the river of life,
Hoping to guide them to the Dao’s shore.
With heartfelt lament and earnest supplication,
I perform the rites of exaltation and salvation.
I purify the sacred space,
Ensuring all is flawless and virtuous.
I atone for sins and redeem guilt,
Refining the essence and elevating the spirit.

The defilements of karma having been cleansed away,
The luminous mind now attains clarity.

Then the body transcends the mortal realm,
The essence merges with the Natural Way,
Relying on the True Wind,
Forever attuned to the subtlety of the Void.

Receiving and upholding the Sacred Edicts,
One attains the boundless expanse of Dao.

Realizing the Original Nature to wander freely,
Awakening the Primordial Heart’s purity and stillness.

The Celestial Fragrance never fades,
Scattering blossoms in the vast Hall of Great Emptiness.

The Cavernous Vision blooms eternal spring,
Dancing in the Realm of Great Luo.

I pay homage to the Primordial Sovereign,
Bow before the Vermilion Emperor,
Beholding the Comet-Wheel and Feathered Canopy’s rites,
Gazing upon the Golden Gate and Jade Hall’s decrees.

Forever transcending the kalpas,
No longer bound by the wheel of rebirth,
Even now at the altar’s threshold,
I receive the fruits of merit.

*Recite the Hidden Speech once,*
*Invoke the Supernal Degree’s Secret Key,*
*Burn the talisman.*

**The Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation (Volume 60 and 61) concludes.**
**The Scripture of Refining and Salvation (Lingbao Liandu Pin).**

The Master rises, stands in silent stillness,
Arranging the Heavenly Dipper, transforming into the Sovereign of the Great One.
Visualizing the gods at his sides.

Then, within the Water-Fire Pool,
Performing the Ascension Ritual,
Standing erect, attire and cap in order,
Calming the spirit, steadying the will,
Bowing to offer incense and petition:

I, the humble servant of the Dao [Name],

Thus may I be granted the power to perform the Salvation,
To rescue the lost souls.

Now I beseech Your Great Compassion,
That You may manifest as clear evidence.

With deepest reverence, I bow twice.

I request the Sacred Rites.

I have heard that the Lingbao Scripture,
Pursuing and salvaging the departed,
Tenfold salvation for the dead,
The Nine Darks’ Hidden Rhymes,
Opening the Natural Way,
The Void’s descent of spirits.

The Great Emptiness generates gods,
Who govern the Law’s symbols,
All returning to the Three Primordials.

Universally informing the Three Realms,
To extinguish the Three Evils,
Sever the Earthly Bonds,
Fly through the Five Gates,
Listed in the Great Mystic,
The Demon King overseeing,
Unbound by the Heavenly Gate.

I am utterly devoted in my supplication.

*Recite the Great One’s Saving Suffering Deity.*

Summon the Flying Heavenly God-Kings,
Burn the talisman.

The Radiant Vision returns to salvation,
The Blossoming Mists gather the multitudes.

The Sovereign’s return radiates light,
The Celestial Chariot sings in the Void.

Flying through the Mystic Pass,
Transforming the Spirits and Demons.

Commanding the Ghostly Armies,
Riding the Great Dao.

Receiving the Primordial Sovereign’s Talisman,
Swirling in the Great Vermilion Clouds.

*Recite the Venerable of the Jewel Banner Who Guides.*

Humbly I pray that the Long-Life Great Sage,
The Flying Heavenly God-Kings, the Flying Heavenly Envoys and Soldiers,
As in the past at the Green Sky’s Floating Lotus Assembly,
Not forgetting the Primordial Sovereign’s Teachings and Precepts.

For the host [Name],
Specially granting salvation for the departed [Name].

Humbly I pray that the dead soul may be refined into a transcendent being,
That the living body may be salvaged, enduring through kalpas.

Then blessings descend upon descendants,

All sentient beings together ascend to the Dao’s shore.

Proclaim the Primordial Sovereign’s Edicts,

*"The **Numinous Treasure Command** refines the departed soul.
The **five zang and six fu, uterus, and root vessels**—

**Jade Sound** summons qi, **spiritual wind** gathers mist.
The **three canopies** pierce clearly, **ten thousand spirits** become immortals.

Now bathe in the **Luminous Pool of Clarity**,
Refine the form with **Fluid Fire**—
All impurities swept away,
Purity attained in its entirety.

The **five turbid and defiled organs**,
Made utterly clean and bright.
No malevolent force may trespass,
The body radiant with light.

For the departed soul, perform the **Nine Refineries of the Corpse**—
I humbly prostrate and report to the **Great Emperor of the Rising Sun**,
The **Venerable Lord of Wood, the Divine Sovereign of the Dao**,
The **Most Exalted Lady, the Venerable Mother of Metal**.

I hear that **primordial Dao/Way** descends as **qi**,
Exquisite substances transform into **essence**,
As the **supreme deities of Heaven and Earth**,
Masters overseeing all **spirits**.

The **Elemental Dao/Way** circulates, giving rise to all things.
The **Celestial Sphere** moves in secret, nurturing the **Three Powers**—
**Deep Mystery’s Great Transformation**,
Ineffable and beyond discourse.

Now, the **ritual master** [certain name],
Who pays homage to the departed **Certain**,
Constructs the **Supreme Grand Ritual**,
Practices the **Great Method of Refinement**,
To summon the departed **Certain**’s soul,
Returning them to the **Human Path**—
For the departed **Certain**,
Whose body dwells in **ten thousand scenes**,
Whose nature is tainted by the **six dusts**.

The **five phases** have scattered into **Ultimate Nothingness**,
The **ten kinds of qi** have no return to their **root origins**.
The **Three Powers** have been condemned,
With **ten thousand kalpas** of suffering—
Without the **sage’s grace**,
True redemption is indeed arduous.

We, the disciples, reverently follow the **wondrous model**,
Embodying the **nurturing plan of Heaven and Earth**.
Carefully applying the **mysterious techniques**,
We align with the **principles of yin and yang harmony**.

Thus, we invoke the **matchless practice of the Perfect Circle**,
Praying for the descent of **flowing water’s essence**,
To refine and form the **uterus**.
The **Heavenly Worthy of the Dan Realm’s Clarity** illuminates with **flame**,
To refine and form the **fetus**.
The **Heavenly Worthy of Extracting Guilt from the Nine Abysses** rides upon **wood’s truth**,

The **Holy Sovereign of the Revolving Wheel** invigorates with **thunder’s resonance**,
To refine and form the **senses**.
The **Heavenly Worthy of Ultimate Clarity and Relief** harnesses **metal’s sharp form**,
To refine and form the **spirit**.

The **Perfect Treasure Heavenly Worthy** hears:
When **Heaven and Earth** harmonize,
The **Nine Refineries** linger in balance—
Once again, we petition the **Primordial Dao/Way’s Essence**,
To envelop the form.

**Pure Yang Dao/Way’s qi** circulates within and without,
The **Three Powers** nurture and complete the shape.
**Inner Harmony** unites, forming the **internal spirit**.
The **Three Pure Ones** unite with its **true soul**.

Thus, we embody **one kind of qi** as **spirit**,
Refine the **nine kinds of qi** to attain the **true**.

We, the disciples, face the **Numinous Truth**,
Recite the **sacred hymns** in praise.

**Hymn to Wood and Metal:**
*The Rising Sun invigorates the **Primordial Qi****,
Lushly sprouting **verdant shoots**.*
*The **Wondrous Mother of Metal** harmonizes naturally,*
*Blooming with the **five phases’ essence**.*
*Divine **qi** congeals in the **Primordial Palace****,
Numinous substances radiate like **crimson clouds**.*
*They attain the **Human Path** of life,*
*And their names are inscribed among the **Immortal Families**.*

We, the disciples, humbly offer incense and prayers,
Reporting to the **Boundless Emperor of the Idle Void**,
The **Boundless Longevity Emperor of Ultimate Meditation**,
The **Heavenly Emperor of the Venerable Monitor**,
The **Emperor of Absolute Silence and the Cosmic Cauldron**,
The **Boundless Emperor of the Unconquered Delight**,
The **Heavenly Emperor of the Mysterious Transformation**,
The **Heavenly Emperor of the Numinous Transformation**,
The **Emperor of High Clarity and Void**,
The **Emperor of No Thought, No Bond, No Attachment**.

We hear of the **Three Treasures’ radiance**,
The **Nine Spirits’ wondrous response**—
Formless, shadowless,
Yet with **symbols and sounds**,
Floating within the **Great Void**,
Ranked within **yin and yang’s domains**,
Moving through the **five celestial paths**,
Causing all things to transform and give birth—
Thus, the **nine kinds of qi** unite,
The **Three Powers** harmonize their **virtue/power**.

Now, we follow the **ritual pattern** to refine the departed soul:
First, we humbly petition the **Venerable Lord of Wood**,
The **Venerable Mother of Metal**,
To descend with the **two luminaries’ essence**,
To gather the **five phases’ refined qi**,
To establish the **root** and receive the **ancestral transmission**,
To generate **essence** at the **Ming Stream**,
To invoke the **dark and containing spirit**,
To manifest in **flickering forms**.

We pray to the **Nine Celestial Emperors**,
To bestow **correct qi** at the **Nine Passes**.
The **Ultimate Truths of the Ten Extremes**,
Receive the **fetal essence** in the **Ten Months**.
**Flowing essence** merges with **chaos**,
Nurturing the **quality** in the **mysterious realm**.

We humbly petition the **Boundless Emperor of the Idle Void**,
To generate the **First Heavenly Truth of Spirit**—
The **uterine essence** of **Primordial Yellow**,
To envelop the **uterus**,
So that the **uterine origins** are fully revealed,
Ascending to **Heaven** to manifest.

We humbly petition the **Boundless Longevity Emperor of Ultimate Meditation**,
To generate the **Second Heavenly Truth of Spirit**—
The **fetal essence** of **Deep Mystery’s Purple Door**,
To envelop the **fetus**,
So that the **fetal bonds** dissolve and the **roots** are severed,
Descending to **Earth** to solidify the **spirit**.

We humbly petition the **Heavenly Emperor of the Venerable Monitor**,
To generate the **Third Heavenly Truth of Spirit**—
The **soul’s essence** of the **Luminous Immortal**,
To envelop the **soul**,
So that the **soul’s gate** opens and the **spirit** reaches the **essence**.

We humbly petition the **Emperor of Absolute Silence and the Cosmic Cauldron**,
To generate the **Fourth Heavenly Truth of Spirit**—
The **ether’s essence** of the **Dark and Mysterious**,
To envelop the **seven ethers**,
So that the **ether’s doors** close and the **passes** are sealed,
And the **Heavenly Sovereign** descends as an **immortal**.

We humbly petition the **Boundless Emperor of the Unconquered Delight**,
To generate the **Fifth Heavenly Truth of Spirit**—
The **organs’ essence** of the **Five Central Spirits**,
To envelop the **five zang**,
So that the **five zang** are cool and clear,
And the **Five Emperors** face the **Truth** to preserve the **spirit**.

We humbly petition the **Heavenly Emperor of the Mysterious Transformation**,
To generate the **Sixth Heavenly Truth of Spirit**—
The **entrails’ essence** of the **Ultimate Truth**,
To envelop the **six fu**,
So that the **stomach’s conduit** generates **saliva** to harmonize.

We humbly petition the **Heavenly Emperor of the Numinous Transformation**,
To generate the **Seventh Heavenly Truth of Spirit**—
The **orifices’ essence** of the **High Immortal’s Mysterious Case**,
To envelop the **orifices**,
So that the **pores and apertures** open with clarity,
And the **stars and constellations** shine brightly to clear the **passages**.

We humbly petition the **Emperor of High Clarity and Void**,
To generate the **Eighth Heavenly Truth of Spirit**—
The **senses’ essence** of the **Congealed Numinous Qi**,
To envelop the **eight senses**,
So that the **three divisions and eight senses** are complete in form and spirit,
And the **dark night** reveals light to protect the body.

We humbly petition the **Emperor of No Thought, No Bond, No Attachment**,
To generate the **Ninth Heavenly Truth of Spirit**—
The **body’s essence** of the **Natural Mysterious Radiance**,
To envelop the **body**,
So that the **three gates, five zang, six fu, and nine palaces**,
The **golden hall and jade chamber**,
The **twelve layered gates**,
The **purple doors and jade pavilions**,
The **thirty-six thousand joints**,
And the **roots and origins**,
All simultaneously manifest the **spirit**.

「Thus the **spirit** spreads **qi** throughout the body,
The voice retains its **spiritual essence**,
Hair grows with **spirit**,
All beneath the **Nine Heavens** submit,
And one attains the **born body**.

We, your humble subjects, bow our heads and kneel twice in reverence.
The petition is now complete. May we contemplate the **Heavenly Sovereign of Transformed Refinement**.

With the **Nine Chapters** recited fully,
The **Five Elements** manifest their forms,
Having received the **Great Dao’s** boundless grace,
We must follow the **Supreme Truth’s** compassionate teachings,
Purify our hearts and align our aspirations,
Listen attentively and practice diligently.

For the **Nine Heavens’ qi** generates its **spirit**,
The **Three Primordial Essences’** purity nourishes its substance,
The **Yellow and White** harmonize,
The **Chaos** unifies its form,
The **Six Celestial Stems** circulate in cycles,
The **Five Agents** interact in resonance,
Emulating **Heaven’s** patterns and **Earth’s** manifestations,
Encompassing **Yin** and emitting **Yang**,
Then **Earth’s** firmness and softness
Conform to **Heaven’s** decrees,
The **Ten Thousand Truths** are complete,
The **Ten Thousand Phenomena** array in order,
Uniting with the **Dao** and attaining **spiritual transcendence**,
Both honored and exalted.

Thus, the **head** becomes **Kunlun**,
The **hair** becomes **stars and constellations**,
The **eyebrows** become the **Celestial Canopy**,
The **eyes** become the **Sun and Moon**,
The **nose** becomes the **Heavenly Pillar**,
The **ears** become the **Heavenly Windows**,
The **mouth** becomes the **Heavenly Gate**,
The **face** becomes the **Heavenly Mirror**,
And the **Five Sacred Mountains**, **Four Great Rivers**, **Nine Rivers**, and **Eight Streams**.

The **One Primordial**, **Two Polarities**,
The **Three Luminaries** and **Four Celestial Symbols**,
The **Five Agents** and **Six Pitches**,
The **Seven Celestial Governors** and **Eight Scenic Phases**,
The **Nine Palaces** and **Ten Directions**,
The **Thirty-Six Heavens** and **Thirty-Six Earths**—
All are present within.

They are the **marvelous manifestations** of the **Great Dao**,
The **divine nurturing** of **spirit and essence**.

You must now preserve **purity and simplicity**,
Cherish **innocence** and cultivate **spiritual truth**,
And within your **enlightened nature** ascend to the **Land of Bliss**.
Yet, do not neglect the **karmic causes and conditions** of good and evil.

We bow our heads in **surrender and devotion** to the **Boundless Dao**.
May we contemplate the **Heavenly Sovereign of Returning Souls and Nurturing Essence**.

We, your humble subjects, have heard that the **Great Sage of Longevity**,
The **Flying Heavenly Spirit King**,
In the **Age of Crimson Clarity**,
Assembled at the **Upper Realm of Azure Beginning**,
Where **mountains and valleys swallow mist**,
And **hidden melodies of the Celestial Treasure** are received.
Where **demonic essences perish**,
And the **original chapter of the Marvelous Head** resounds.
Where the **function of reviving the corpse** is bestowed,
And the **rank of supervising the True One** is granted,
Following the **voice of aspiration** and responding to **sentiments**,
Attending to **wishes** and achieving **rebirth**.

We humbly pray that the **Great Sage of Longevity**,
The **Flying Heavenly Spirit King**,
May bestow the **symbolic decree of the Primordial Origin**,
And pardon the **guilty souls of the Northern Capital**.
That the **deceased certain person**,
May obtain the **protection of the demon-queller**,
And ascend at every moment.

With **attendants** escorting and welcoming,
Emerging from the **Earthly Gate**,
Transcending the **Three Realms**,
And reaching the **Upper Southern Palace**.
Free from the **Five Sufferings** and **Eight Hardships**,
Recommended to the **Seven Ancestors** and **Nine Mysterious Ones**,
And attaining great joy.

May there be no hindrances,
And may we fully comply with the **original mandate**.
We are most earnest in our supplications.

May we contemplate the **Heavenly Sovereign of Attending to Wishes and Achieving Rebirth**,
And proclaim the **Great Vow of the Jade Purity**—**uniting and ascending to Heaven**.

The **merits and virtues** of past **refinement and transcendence** are now complete.
Now we must summon the **One Line’s** divine generals and officials—
The **Functionary of Merit**, **Soldiers of the Law**—
To gather at the **altar’s base**,
And await the **dispatch and command** for escort and protection.

**Reading the Dispatch and Protection Decree for the Deceased Certain Person**:
We humbly submit that the **deceased certain person**,
Has no path to **rebirth**,
And must rely on the **gate of extraction and elevation**.

Now, as the **officer in charge**,
We recall the **Netherworld’s** trials,
Hoping to ascend to the **Dao’s** shore,
And pour out our **sorrowful thoughts**,
Diligently practicing the **science of refinement and transcendence**.

According to the **mysterious scriptures**,
We present all **meritorious virtues**,
Confess our **transgressions** and **expiate our sins**,
Refine our **substance** and **transmigrate our spirit**.
When **grievances and resentments** are cleansed,
Our **nature and cognition** will naturally become clear,
Then we may **remove the Black Ledger**, **erase the name from the Crimson Book**,
And **lean on the True Wind**,
To forever **contract with the Boundless Void**.

We must **obey the Sacred Edict**,
And strive to reach the **Broad and Remote Land**.
Where the **scenery is as bright as spring**,
And we **ride the reins in the Great Luo’s** realm.
Where the **Heavenly Book** is never closed,
And we **scatter flowers in the Great Miao’s** hall.
Where our **body enters the Jade Capital**,
And we **face the Primordial Origin**,
Gazing upon the **Golden Gate and Jade Chamber’s** model,
And beholding the **Jade Wheel and Celestial Canopy’s** ceremony.

Swiftly **attaining transcendence**,
Forever **unbound by the Wheel of Rebirth**.
We must also **purify the soul’s residue**,
And **order the spirit’s conduct**,
Pay respects to the **Emptiness Emperor**,
And joyfully depart from the **altar**.

**The Alchemical Refinement of Primordial Yin**

When **Primordial Unity** (*Hunyuan*) merges with **qi**, it coalesces into **Spirit** (*Ling*).
The **Three Primordials** and **Nine Numbers** divide into twelve,
In Heaven, they manifest as the **Twelve Constellations** and their domains,
In Man, they form the **Twelve Meridians**, **Zang-Fu organs**, aligning with **Six Yin and Six Yang**,
Giving rise to the **internal and external transformations** that shape life.

When the **Yin corpse** undergoes alchemical transmutation,
**Qi** is gathered, **Spirit** refined—
The **True Vermilion Landscape** is illuminated,
Piercing through **Yang Light**,
Never descending into **dark realms**,
Ascending to the **Dao’s true domain**.

**The Method states:**
Take **reed stalks** to fashion a human form,
Clothe it with the **transformed remains** of the deceased.
Inscribe **Twelve Dao** of the **Elixir Scripture’s** *Hua Xing* talismans,
Distribute them across the **Five Zang and Six Fu organs**,
And affix the **Great Brahmanic Billions of Celestial Seals** from the **Elixir Scripture** upon the abdomen.
Further, place the **Elixir Scripture’s Ascension-to-Heaven Talisman** in a **crimson pouch**,
Wearing it upon the head.

Additionally, deploy the **Five Sacred Talismans of the Spirit Treasure**,
Arranging them upon the deceased’s **Five Zang organs**, fused into **Three Departments, Eight Scenes, Twenty-Four True Essences**.
First, erect the **altar**, perform the **Dao**, observe the **fast**, and set the **offerings**.
Petition the **Emptiness Emperor, Supreme Sovereign**,
Pass through the **Nine Fortified Gates, the Cold Courtyard of the Spring’s Bend**,
And only then summon the **wandering soul**—
Then the ritual may proceed.

At nightfall, the **Dao Official**, adorned in **solemn rites**,
Places the **reed effigy** at the **eastern-north Ghost Gate** outside the great door.
The **Dao Official**, standing at the **Earthly Gate**,
Transforms into the **Nine-Petal True Person**,
Steps upon the **Luo constellations**, stands at the **Luo’s tail**,
Gazing toward the **Heavenly Gate**, invoking the **True Qi**.
A **young acolyte** holds the **Soul-Summoning Banner**,
Standing at the **Heavenly Gate**.
The **Dao Official** gathers one **Qi**, transforming it into one **organ**.
Then, the **Dao Assembly** raises the **Golden Gate’s Celestial Deity’s** effigy,
Commanding the **acolyte** to circle and summon **True Qi**,
Distributing it into the **reed effigy’s body**—
Twelve **Qi** completed.

At the **Human Gate**, the **Dao Official** animates the **reed effigy** into human form.
The **Dao Assembly**, alongside the **Dao Official**, recites the **Hidden Words**,
Circumambulating the effigy three times with **willow-branch sprinkled elixir water**.
The **Dao Assembly** then leads the **Void-Step Procession**,
Lowering the effigy to the **altar’s base**.
The **Dao Official** proceeds in order to **refine and deliver** the **Twelve Primordial Rites**.

This method, inscribed upon **Nine-Yin Yellow Talismans**,
May be used to **deliver only three deceased souls**.
If applied to many, it shall not succeed.

The Twelve Yang Talismans,
Emerging from the *Shenxiao* Scripture of the Six Yang Divine Immortals of the Celestial Dao,
Are to be inscribed according to the method,
With the decrees of the Three Palaces’ Sun and Moon appended above,
And the talismans combined with the *Tongxing* Dissolving Form Incantation.

**The Twelve Great Generals’ Talisman**
The Imperial Edict states:
Within this talisman are one hundred twenty Great Generals,
Each led by one supreme commander.
When refining and summoning them,
Burn the talisman one by one as needed,
To transmute and birth the Five Zang and Six Fu.

When inscribing the Twelve True Talismans,
Enter the Chamber of Tranquility,
Summon the Great Generals and Spirit Officials to descend,
Burn incense and report to the Most High.
State your petition.
For refining and summoning the departed soul,
Face southeast,
Using realgar mixed with cinnabar,
Inscribed upon yellow silk,
With no speech while writing—
Mind focused, spirit steadfast,
Pondering the Three Realms with true intent,
Forming the talisman in one breath of qi,
Drawing the central yellow qi into the talisman,
Along with the chaotic red script,
And burning it in the Fire Pool.

**The Nine Yin Talisman**
One breath of qi generates the Kidney,
The Six Heavenly Stems’ Yang transforming into Yin,
The Great General Yang [□□]

**The Nine Yin Talismans (Continued)**

**Black Ground, White Script**
One breath of *qi* generates the Heart, the Seven Circulations blending with the Great General Ding□.

**Red Ground, Black Script**
One breath of *qi* generates the Liver, the Eight Revolutions uniting with the Great General Ding□□.

**Blue Ground, Cinnabar Script**
One breath of *qi* generates the Lungs, the Nine Radiant Gatherings with the Great General Chen Zhi Yuan.

**White Ground, Cinnabar Script**
One breath of *qi* generates the Spleen, the Ten Harmonizations of Yin and Yang with the Great General Wang Xian Zhi.

One breath of *qi* generates the Heart’s Vascular Network, the Seventeenth Yin-Yang Harmonizations with the Great General Zheng Ming.

**Right Yin, Twelve Dao**
Emerging from the Celestial Pivot’s Law, the Cavern of Yang, and the Jade Refinement.

According to the Law, inscribe the talisman above, adding the Three Palaces’ Imperial Edict of Sun and Moon below, and record the Great Generals’ names and surnames. For refining and summoning the departed soul, first call each Great General’s name and surname, recite the incantation, and write the talisman with a *dharma*-chanted brush. Draw the *qi* from the eastern direction to imbue the talisman, then face southeast and burn it.

**The Great Yin Talisman of Ascension and Refinement**
**The Talisman of Protection and Ascension**
The Sovereign decrees: *"To transcend and refine the departed soul, when the merit is complete and the fruits fulfilled, one must proceed to the Three Heavens. If the great demons of the Three Realms refuse to protect and ascend, without the Talisman of Yin-Yang Harmony, one cannot ascend. Thus, the Primordial Sovereign, in compassion, left this Great Talisman to deliver both the living and the dead.*

*By imperial decree, the Earthly Gate is opened, and the attendants escort and welcome. The Earthly Gate is closed, and the Five Torments and Eight Difficulties are expelled. The departed soul forever departs the Ghostly Officials, and its essence ascends to the Vermilion Mansion. Refined and reborn, it passes through the Celestial Gate and is escorted to the Southern Palace by decree."*

The Mystic Master says: *"The *San Huang Nei Wen* contains the Ascension Talisman. On the day one attains the Dao and ascends in flight, the Celestial Lord dispatches true attendants to bestow the Talisman, so that flesh and spirit may ascend together, pass through the Celestial Gate, and in the mortal world, be forbidden to usurp this text. Thus, the Three Heavens’ Talisman of Harmony, the Jade Purity’s Precious Talisman, the Most High’s Sacred Edict, and the Jade Emperor’s True Text are granted to the living body.*

*Scholars of the Dao, when they worship the Primordial and pay homage to the True, extract and refine the departed soul, refine its spirit to the Southern Heaven, and ensure it is not bound by the Celestial Gate.*

*Take a blue paper square, fold it into four sides, and inscribe the Talisman text with cinnabar. On the reverse, write three lines of declaration: one line for year, month, day, and hour; one line for the Dharma Master’s name and rank. Together, they form the Five Lines. Wrap it in a crimson silk pouch, tied with green thread.*

*Scholars must wear this Talisman hung before their heart. For the deceased, bestow it upon them for burning, and together with the Celestial Gate’s scribes, they will instantly release their mortal form. The Talisman text."*

Today, I rejoice in receiving the passage and release. This person has traversed the gates of all the heavens, petitioning the annihilation of the Three Evils, severing the earthly roots, ascending beyond the Five Hells, and attaining the name of **Tàixuán** (太玄, "Great Primordial"). The **Mówáng** (魔王, "Demon King") oversees their elevation, unbound by the Celestial Gate, just as declared in the Talisman.

The **Five-Line Talisman of the Primordial and True**—this person’s joyous passage today, traversing the gates of all the heavens, as stated, unbound by the Celestial Gate—**Yùqīng Fú Mìng** (玉清符命, "Jade Purity Talisman Command"), ascending to the Dao’s realm, just as practiced in reverence.

**From *Lingbao: The Supreme Method for Salvaging Countless Beings*, Volume 63.**
**The Nine Refining Resurrection Technique:**

The Master says:
When the Three Lights illuminate, the Nine Suns circulate,
the *Hun Yuan* (混元) qi coalesces—
thus forming the *Lingbao* Three Primordials.

Counting the twelve divisions of the *Zhou* (周),
in Heaven, the Twelve Celestial Ministries;
on Earth, the Twelve Celestial Divisions;
in Man, the Twelve Meridians and Twelve Organs,
corresponding to the Six Yin and Six Yang.

If the departed undergo the Nine Refining Resurrections,
their inner and outer forms regenerate,
restoring human shape.
If they do not undergo the Nine Refining Resurrections,
their form remains incomplete,
bound by karmic defilements.

Thus, the *Lingbao* Secret Fast Method
first refines the departed’s soul through the Nine Resurrections,
returning the corpse-spirit to its original form.
Next, the divine protectors of the immortals,
those cultivating the True Way,
can stabilize their qi, preserve their form,
and through proper cultivation,
harmonize yin and yang’s transformations—
naturally aligning their spiritual qi with the Dao,
all arising from yin-yang’s interplay.
When yin is exhausted and pure yang remains,
they ascend to the True Realm.

Ordinary mortals, failing to honor their qi,
preserve their form, or cherish their spirit,
indulge in desires, exhaust their spirit,
dissipate their primordial yang,
destroying themselves, severing from their True Nature—
until their soul sinks into the Nine Nights,
their vital breath falls into the Three Abysses,
unaware, unable to achieve transcendence.

Thus, the Most High’s compassion,
the Primordial Sovereign’s pity,
established the Three Caverns’ salvation format,
revealed the Nine Resurrection Refining statutes,
universally salvaging the living and the dead,
relying on both the luminous and the obscure.

Scholars who chant the Golden Scriptures,
swallow these talismans,
cyclically repeating them,
will obtain the True Qi of the Nine Heavens’ Great Harmony,
flowing into the Three Palaces,
ascending the Lights to greet the Dawn—
the day is near.

Salvaging departed souls
removes karmic obstacles,
releases past lives’ suffering.
According to the Master’s intent,

At **66,666,660 years**, reaching the **Eon of Extended Nourishment and Primordial Flower** (延康素华金劫),
the **Four Cardinal Directions’ Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors** were established,
the **Twenty-Eight Constellations’ Boundaries** were set,
and the **Four Extremes’ Celestial Sovereigns** governed the four quarters.

At **55,550 billion years**, reaching the **Eon of Opening Brilliance and Primordial Yang** (开皇元阳之劫)—
this being the **Water Eon**—
the **Five Directions’ Five Elders and Five Emperors** were born,
along with the **Five Sacred Mountains’ peoples**,
and the **Five Eons of Enlightenment** spread to the four corners.
Thus, the **Nine Directions’ Nine Heavens**, the **Nine Exaltations and Nine Saints**, the **Nine True Ones and Nine Immortals**, the **Nine Subtle Paths and Nine Dao**, the **Nine Luminaries and Nine Stars**, the **Nine Palaces and Nine Fortifications of Nine Yin**—
all were transformations of the **Primordial Dao’s Upper, Middle, and Lower Three Elements** (三元),
the **Nine Qi of Azure, Yellow, White, Vermilion, Purple, Crimson, Jade, and Luminous** (青黄白丹紫绛碧景琅九炁).

Thus the scripture says:
*"Though these three names differ, they are all the ultimate of Heaven and Earth."*

The *Qīng Wéi Miào Fàn* states:
*"When qi is pure and refined, it ascends and forms the celestial realm.
When qi is turbid and congeals, it descends and forms the earthly domain.
When the two qi intermingle, yin and yang intertwine,
and the primordial qi coalesces harmoniously—
thus, the Dao of humanity is born."*

All who are born in human form
share the same essence and pattern as Heaven and Earth’s primordial creation,
never differing in the slightest.

The **Primordial Origin’s root** is the **mysterious qi without form**,
where **yang essence** first manifests,
the **divine valley** vast and boundless,
formless and undifferentiated,
without substance or appearance,
without sound or light—
this is the **root of the Great Divine Treasure of the Primordial Heavenly Spirit** within the human body.

When **fire ignites the latent palace**,
and **qi flows into the Cavernous Yang**,
the two qi blend and intertwine,
refining and transforming,
the **divine realm unites**,
and **essence and blood align**—
this is the **root of the Soul’s Divine Treasure**.

Once **yin and yang are established**, the body embodies the **two eons**.
According to the **Chi Ming method**,
the **embryo forms within the Central Yellow**,
the **qi circulates twenty-seven times**,
and the **embryonic spirit** contains **a hundred transformations**.

When the **three transformations** align,
the **primordial harmony** takes form,
and the **Great Polarity** is born.

At **thirty-six degrees**, the **metallic qi** nurtures the **soul**.
At **forty-five degrees**, the **Heavenly One and Great One** nurture the **spirit**,
the **five phases** take their positions,
the **five viscera** bloom with **color**,
the **upper Dan Tian’s Nine Palaces** form,
the **middle’s Three Elements and Six Organs** manifest,
and the **nine hues** complete the **human form**.

At **nine months**, the **celestial count** completes **eighty-one cycles**,
the **earthly count** reaches **thirty-six**,
and the **nine qi of the fetus** achieve fullness,
corresponding to the **Nine Qi Heavens above**.

Then, the **Great One Sovereign of the Primordial Element** holds the **Symbol of Birth**,
the **Long-Life Emperor** determines the **rank of one’s fate**,
the **Registrar** records the **years of life**,
the **Aged Official** registers the **ledger**,
the **Sage of Destiny** calculates the **allotted lifespan**,
the **Five Emperors** oversee the **process of creation**,
the **Nine Heavenly Holy Mothers** guard the **chambers**,
the **Nine Heavenly Marshals** command the **registers**,
and the **Chao Taiwei Constellation** is summoned,
giving birth to **ten thousand spirits and a hundred officials**,
with the **three realms** standing guard—
all reverently obeying in unison—
and thus, the birth of a human body,
how could it differ from Heaven and Earth?

Thus the scripture says:
*"If the Nine Heavenly Marshals do not descend with their registers,
and the ten thousand spirits do not chant their reverent assent,
then birth will not occur."*

At the time of birth, it is not considered vulgar.
Yet, if one cannot **preserve and nurture the Primordial Harmony**,
or **refine the Innocent Child**,
but instead **accumulates greed and wrath**,
darkly inviting **guilt and calamity**—
then the **ten thousand spirits depart from the body**,
the **One True Essence disperses**,
the **soul and spirit are bound in the murky void**,
and **guilt and filth pollute the Three Fields**.
Unless one undergoes the **Nine Refining Resurrections**,
how could suffering ever cease?

It is fitting to **humble oneself in the dark paths**,
to **follow and practice reverently**,
and **pray for true response**,
lest one **neglect and defy Heaven’s decrees**.

According to the **Master’s instructions**,
when performing the **Nine Refining Resurrections**,
first, **incense, flowers, lamps, and candles** must be prepared with solemnity.
Facing east, **offering reverence**,
the **High Functionary** lights the incense,
first **kneeling and bowing three times**,
then **lighting incense and bowing again**,
and **prostrating fully**,
reciting the **intent of the fast**,
and **reporting to**:
the **Nine Refining Heavenly Sovereigns**,
the **Soul’s Natural Divine True Ones of the Nine Heavens**,
and the **Five Directional Five Heavenly Emperors**.

If the **petition is granted**,
the **Nine Refining Return-to-Life True Officials**,
the **Divine Spirit Officials and Soldiers**,
and the **Five Directional Five Sacred Children**
will **oversee the Nine Refining Resurrection** of the deceased.

The petitioner, fearing that **mere mortal flesh** cannot **reach the Divine**,
and that **direct supplication may fail to comply with ritual protocol**,
prepares the **five-directional five-colored divine qi**,
infusing it into their own body,
**purifying the Three Palaces**,
**clearing the five turbidities**,
**opening the viscera and bowels**,
and **smoothing the hundred passages**—
thus, the **petition may ascend directly**.

Humbly awaiting **Heaven’s mercy**,
the **petition is granted**,
and the **divine qi descends into the body**,
**washing away filth**,
**strengthening the qi**,
and **reporting to the Mysterious Vault**,
**urging swift response**,
**summoning the divine officials**,
and **achieving immediate effect**.

The **Nine Refining of the Departed Soul** thus ascends,
the **fast’s merit is fulfilled**,
and **demonic obstacles do not arise**.

The petitioner, **daring to offend Heaven’s might**,
with **no words to express their urgency**,
**prostrates in reverence**,
and **speaks thus**:

Now, standing at the altar’s center,
the **left hand holds the Universal Salvation Formula**,
reciting the **ritual incantation**,
and **visualizing the place of refinement and resurrection**.

The **Five-Colored Divine Qi** naturally covers the place of refinement.
Visualize **Taiyi the Saving-Suffering Heavenly Worthy**, the **Ten-Direction Saving-Suffering Heavenly Worthy**, the **Broadly Salvaging Sinking Heavenly Worthy**, the **Zhuling Degree-Life Heavenly Worthy**, the **Law-Bridge Great Salvation Heavenly Worthy**, the **Fire-Refining Elixir Realm Heavenly Worthy**, the **Turning-Wheel Holy King Heavenly Worthy**, the **Golden Gate Transformed Body Heavenly Worthy**, the **Xiaoyao Joyous Heavenly Worthy**, the **Bao Hua Perfect Heavenly Worthy**, the **Nine-Heaven Divine Chapter Heavenly Sovereign**, and the **Nine-Refining Return-to-Life True Officials and Historians of Heavenly Worthies**—all arrayed in **Nine-Colored Cloud-and-Feather Robes**, with **Nine-Heaven Imperial Attire and Crowns**, holding **jewels of office**, as **Refinement Officials and Historians like the Marquises and Viscounts of the World**, each riding upon **clouds and void-striding**, descending to the altar.

**Yellow clouds and purple mists**, the **Five-Colored Divine Qi**, envelop the altar above.
Gather **divine precision**—**do not let the mind wander**.
The **Nine-Refining Divine Officials** kindle the **Cavernous Yang Fire**, refining the departed soul, awaiting the recitation of the **Nine Chapters**.

Visualize **Nine Emergences of Nine-Colored Divine Light** in a single stream, filling the void—within which stands **Yushen Yuanhuang Daojun**, flanked by the **Two True Persons** attending him, emitting the **Boundless Divine Light** to refine the souls being liberated below.

Burn the **talisman**, grasp the **Nine-Refining Formula**, and silently recite the **Superior Ascension Incantation**:
*"By the Jade Purity Talisman Law,
I refine your soul for you.
Returning twice to the Human Dao,
To transcend the Supreme Clarity.
Swiftly, as the Law commands."*

Upon completing the incantation, take the **Eastern Qi** and blow upon the talisman, sending it into the **fire pool** to burn.

Next, silently recite the names of **Taiyi the Saving-Suffering Heavenly Worthy**, the **Fire-Refining Elixir Realm Heavenly Worthy**, and the **Zhuling Degree-Life Heavenly Worthy**, each **three times**, then recite the **Incantation for Liberating the Departed Soul**:
*"South Yán’s Cavernous Drift,
The Hall of Flowing Fire.
Jade-Eyed Refinement,
Yellow Flower Disperses Form.
Soul and Spirit Liberated,
Ascending into Zhuling.
Swiftly, as the Law commands."*

Then recite the **Nine-Refining Return-to-Life Liberation Ascension Incantation**:
*"True Light Refines,
All Guilty Souls.
Spirit and Soul Clarified,
Stagnant Ghosts Ascend.
Golden Form Transformed,
Nine Refining Ascends.
Swiftly, as the Law commands."*

When performing the **Nine Refining**, maintain a **serene and solemn mind**—let body and form be forgotten, so that **divine precision penetrates thoroughly**. If even a **hair’s breadth of distraction** lingers in the mind, the practice will not reach completion. Follow this method faithfully.

Chant **thirty times**, striking the teeth, visualizing **one’s own Three Dantians emitting Three-Colored True Qi**, ascending to connect with the **Heavenly Realm**.

The **Three Pure Heavenly Sovereigns** emerge from the **Three Dantians**, the **Nine-Heaven Heavenly Sovereigns** from the **Nasal Cavity’s Nine Palaces**, and **Yuáncháng Cífù Dānlín Dàdì Mùgōng Zūnshén**, clad in **Five-Colored Robes and Crowns**, with **Wang Qiáo** to his left and **Chìsōngzǐ** to his right, emerging from the **liver through the left eye**.

Visualize the **Five Celestial Sovereigns of the Five Directions** and the **Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns**, floating in the void and standing amidst **Five-Colored Clouds**.

Visualize the **Ten-Directional Sacred Treasure Celestial Venerables**, the **Ten-Directional Rescue-Suffering Celestial Venerables**, and the **Ten-Directional Rescue-Suffering True Persons**.

The guilty spirits, upon seeing the auspicious light, all attain liberation.

The **Nine Refined Return-to-Life True Officials and Attendants**, each riding **True Qi**, stand at the altar’s left, right, front, and rear.

Visualize the **Danling Great God** and the **Zhuling Divine Lord**, each riding a **Fire Dragon**, emerging from the **heart through the Double Storey**, then from between the **two eyebrows into the altar**, where the Fire Dragons leap and bound, turning the entire earth into **Five-Colored True Fire**, boundless in extent.

The **Pre-Assembled Ritual Assembly** visualizes themselves as **Supervising Refinement True Persons**.

Thus, the spirit spreads **True Qi**, the voice resonates with the spirit, and hair and body grow.

Next, burn the **Five God Fusion Symbol**, causing the **Five Gods to reinhabit the Five Viscera**.

Burn the **Hundred Gods Fusion Symbol**, causing the **Hundred Gods to assemble**. The four limbs become as **pure lapis lazuli**, housing a **jewel moon**, with not a speck of dust.

**The Nine Refining Methods for Reviving the Dead**
*Master Tian of the Nine Refining Methods*

The Imperial Sage says: *"The Nine Refining Methods for reviving the dead are the supreme Dao. All beings, upon receiving life, emerge from the void of non-being, drawing upon their past karma, encountering present causes, embodying the forms of Heaven and Earth, containing the essence of Sun and Moon, transforming Yin and Yang, with their spirit-mind traversing myriad changes. The Triple Burner subtly condenses within the Nine Heavens’ mysterious operations, all formed by the Nine Heavenly *qi* of divine birth, blending harmoniously to give life.

The first month forms the embryo, as the boundless *qi* of the Pure and Single Heaven descends upon it.
The second month forms the fetus, as the boundless *qi* of the Highest Meditative Heaven of Infinite Life descends upon it.
The third month, the soul is complete, as the *qi* of the Celestial Warden’s Heavenly Extension descends upon it.
The fourth month, the vital essence is formed, as the *qi* of the Silent Fettered Heaven descends upon it.
The fifth month, the five viscera take shape, as the *qi* of the Heaven of Pralaya’s Unconceited Bliss descends upon it.
The sixth month, the six bowels are formed, as the *qi* of the Void-Resounding Heaven of Transformative Sound descends upon it.
The seventh month, the orifices awaken, as the *qi* of the Celestial Auxiliary Spirit-Transforming Heaven descends upon it.
The eighth month, the form takes substance, as the *qi* of the High and Empty Heaven of Pure Clarity descends upon it.
The ninth month, the spirit descends, as the *qi* of the Heaven of No-Thought, No-Knot, No-Love descends upon it.

Within the body, ten thousand eight hundred spirits—internal and external—unite, and thirty-six thousand spirits simultaneously birth the form. Golden halls and jade chambers, purple gates and spirit-cloth, encircle the body, responding within and without. When the voice is present and the spirit complete, the Three Primordials nurture it, the Nine *qi* solidify the form, ceaseless day and night, transforming and circulating. The Yellow God receives its substance, so within the womb, all past-life matters are known, and the origins of birth are clear. Yet once nourishment and filth are ingested, they are forgotten.

No birth exists without receiving the Nine *qi*. Now, if we gather and refine the *qi* of the Nine Heavens, dispersing it across the eight directions, the corpse will revive, the withered will emit smoke, karmic burdens will be purged, the Nine Heavens will merge, and all spirits will be complete. The spirit-mind will be clear, and the soul will transcend the Three Heavens, embodying Heaven and mirroring Earth, containing Yin and embracing Yang, birthing spirits and dispersing *qi*, each with its own method. Through successive refinements, one ascends to the Formless.

For those practicing the Nine Refining Methods for reviving the dead, construct nine altars, each nine *chi* high and eighty-one *cun* wide, or nine *cun* high and five *cun* wide, symbolizing the Nine Heavens. At the altar’s center, place a yellow silk banner nine *cun* wide and thirty-six *cun* tall, inscribed with *The Dao of the Primordial Qi*, using male and female yellow ink. Write the Nine Heavenly Sovereigns’ titles on tablets, distributing them across each altar. Use blue paper to inscribe one *Nine Refining Talisman* per altar, placing it upon the altar.

Arrange nine lamps, totaling eighty-one. Each altar holds one bottle of sealed *divine water* in yellow paper. The officiant, within the altar, brandishes the banner to summon spirits, tracing the Seven Stars’ array, reciting incantations to call the soul, welcoming it beneath the altar.

Next, offer incense and bow three times before the Nine Heavenly Sovereigns, presenting tea and wine, declaring the *Nine Refining Petition*, and burning the *Sacred Talisman of the Mysterious Tiger and Jade Edicts*.*

**Entering the Refining Process**
First, extinguish the hidden Nine Heavenly *Divine Birth Lamps*, called the *Nine Cups*. After burning the talismans, the master traces the star array to transform into the *Supreme Sovereign of the Golden Threshold of the Highest Heaven*, appearing as the Jade Emperor, residing within golden light and purple mist, attended by True Persons, Golden Boys, and Jade Girls.

Visualize the Nine Heavenly Sovereigns’ palaces, clearly perceiving the four directions bathed in Nine Clouds’ radiance. Each of the Nine Sovereigns sends thousands of divine officials, standing around, vivid as seen.

Next, recite the *Nine Chapters*, burning each altar’s corresponding imperial *qi* talisman. Upon completion, recite the *Nine Palace Incantations*, adjusting for the four seasons: spring at the eastern altar, summer at the southern, autumn at the western, and winter at the northern. Then recite the *Master’s Incantations* and the *Nine Heavenly Divine Birth Chapters*.

Each altar burns its respective *Qi Talisman*, with the *Primordial Qi* of the Dark Origin blown upon it. Rotate while reciting the *Great Brahman’s Hidden Speech*, sprinkling with purified water. After the incantations, guide the departed soul to each altar, positioning it beneath.

First, declare the *Nine Heavenly Yang Talismans* to revive the soul and spirit.
Next, declare the *Nine Yin Talismans* to preserve the vital essence and true nature.
Then, declare the *Five Lingbao Talismans* to birth ten thousand spirits.
Recite the *Hidden Speech* once, drawing the *qi* of the five directions, then blow the *Primordial Qi* of the Dark Origin three times to stabilize the true *qi*.

Next, clarify the departed’s past-life karma, then declare:
*'Now, cherish its form, preserve its spirit, honor its *qi*, and fortify its root. It shall never decay or perish, attaining divinity, with flesh and bone ascending together to the Three Pure Ones. This is the union of the Three *qi* in virtue, the Nine *qi* achieving transcendence.'*

**The Nine Refining Methods**
The Imperial Sage says: *"First, offer incense at the Mysterious Case, summoning the departed spirit before the case to face the sacred. Bow three times, then return to the eastern orientation, requesting tea and wine for the sacred presence.

Next, trace the star array, spit water, and burn the *Talismans for Urgently Summoning and Conveying the Departed Soul to the Altar for Refining*.

Recite the burning talisman incantation:
*'Lingbao Command Talisman*
*True Soul-Summoning Talisman*
*Summoning the Departed Soul*
*To Attend the Altar for Refining*
*Swiftly, by the Heavenly Sovereign’s Decree.'*

Next, invoke the *Yellow Flower Heavenly Venerable of Dissolving Form*, burning the *Yang Essence Talisman of the Yellow Qi*.
Next, invoke the *Heavenly Venerable of the Fire-Refined Dan Realm*, burning the *Great Fire Body-Refining Talisman*.
Recite the *Three Chapter Brand*, declaring the *Method for Closing the Nine Cups*.
Next, proclaim the *Nine Heavenly Venerable’s Petition*, circling the nine altars while reciting the *Great Brahman’s Hidden Speech* three times.
Then declare the *Nine Dragon Command Talismans*, invoke the *Nine Heavenly Refining Venerables*, and burn nine blocks of incense in each altar’s furnace, using the *Divine Birth Chapter’s* original *Non-Differentiation Talisman* for transformation. Invoke the *Heavenly Venerable of Transmuting the Form*.

Offer incense again and pray:
*'In the established ritual position, your servant [name] humbly reports...'*

Humbly it is heard that the realm of Xi Yi is distant and obscure, yet in a fleeting moment, only the refined and luminous may be sought.
With reverence, we uphold the *Shengshen* [生神] Canon, truly marking the merit of reviving the dead.
Without delay, we humbly receive, hoping to merit divine favor.

Incense is offered in supplication to:
The *Elemental Yang Benevolent Father*, the *Great Emperor of the Peach Blossom*, the *Wood Lord Venerable Dao Lord*, the *Nine-Spirit Most Mysterious Celestial Jade Dan Empress of the White Tortoise Platform*, the *Golden Mother Venerable*, the *Green-Spirit Primordial Old Lord of the Nine Qi*, the *Dan-Spirit True Old Lord of the Three Qi*, the *Luminous-Spirit Celestial Old Lord of the Seven Qi*, the *Yù-Spirit Mysterious Old Lord of the Five Qi*, the *Yellow-Spirit Yellow Old Lord of the One Qi*, the *Yù-Dan Boundless Heavenly Emperor*, the *Supreme Supreme Meditative Benevolent Boundless-Life Heavenly Emperor*, the *Brahmanic Guardian Mustard Heavenly Emperor*, the *Silent Fùshù Heavenly Emperor*, the *Bharani Non-Arrogant Music Heavenly Emperor*, the *Tongxuan Transformative Responsive Heavenly Emperor*, the *Linghua Brahmanic Auxiliary Heavenly Emperor*, the *High Void Pure-Luminous Heavenly Emperor*, the *Non-Thought Non-Knot Non-Love Heavenly Emperor*, the *Flying Heavenly King*, the *Long-Life Great Sage*, the *Child of No Merit*, the *White Primordial Venerable*, the *Nine-Heaven Supreme Unity Lord*, the *Nine-Heaven Extended-Life Lord*, the *Peach-Kang Harmonizing-Longevity Lord*, the *Nine-Heaven Bestowing-Life Bestowing-Fortune Lord*, the *Nine-Heaven Guardian-House Holy Mother*, the *Nine-Heaven Supervising-Life Great God*, all *Ministerial Lords of Bestowing-Fortune Preserving-Life*, the *Three Realms’ Officials*, and all *Mighty Spirits*.

May your benevolent radiance shine resplendent, your celestial guards stand solemn, the assembled immortals attend in procession, and the gathered true ones escort in solemnity. May the dew of the *Xuanxiao* [璇霄] be bountiful, and the wind of the *Bǎoyè* [宝叶] blow with divine power.

Descend upon this fasting altar, expand the Dao’s shelter, and receive our prostrations and devout praise.

Next, burn the *Thunder Script*, recite the *Hidden Speech*, and burn the *Return-to-Truth Command Talisman*.
Then invoke the *Hymn of Returning to Life*:

*"Transformation cycles like the turning of a wheel,
The sandalwood’s root remains unaltered.
With a tranquil heart, contemplate the Absolute Truth,
Follow the natural flow, abandoning the snares of illusion.
Ever recite the Jade Chapter,
Whose mystic tones pierce the celestial mists.
Forever enjoy the endless age,
Who could reckon the eons’ toll?"*

Then, with two prostrations and incense offered, we humbly kneel and bow repeatedly, reporting to the *Great Emperor of the Peach Blossom*, the *Wood Lord Venerable Dao Lord*, and the *Nine-Spirit Most Mysterious Celestial Jade Dan Empress of the White Tortoise Platform*.

Humbly it is heard that the *Primordial Origin* descended the *qi*, and wondrous substances refined their essence, becoming the *Heavenly Venerable* of all things, the sovereign of the *Lingzhen* [灵真].
Circulating the *Primordial Brahman*, all formed things were endowed with life.
Secreting the *Xuanji* [璇玑], all things returned to be molded.
The *Heavy Mysterious Transformation* is most wondrous, beyond thought.

Now, for the deceased *Certain Person*, who was once *Certain Deceased Person*, we have constructed this sacred hall, provided the *hun* [魂] offerings, and seek to restore them to human life.
Truly, the departed soul was long entangled in worldly bonds, ignorant of the true path.
The *Nine Qi* found no return, the *Five Phases* scattered and lost, the *Three Hun* were condemned, and for ten thousand kalpas they sank into ruin. Without a virtuous cause, how could they return to life?

We reverently follow the *Mystic Canon*, embodying the creative function of *Heaven and Earth*.
We adhere to the *Play of Yin-Yang*, harmonizing their numbers.
In secret, we perform the matching rites, humbly thanking the *Primordial Ancestor*.

May you descend the *flowing water’s essence*, refined into a *bāo* [胞].
May the *yang fire’s luminosity* be refined into a *tāi* [胎].
May the *wood’s constancy* be refined into a *hún* [魂].
May the *soft gold’s form* be refined into a *pò* [魄].
May the *earth’s essence* be refined into the *zàng* [脏].
May the *Kàn’s spirit* be refined into the *fǔ* [腑].
May the *Li’s precision* be refined into the *qiào* [窍].
May the *Zhèn’s resonance* be refined into the *jǐng* [景].
May the *Duì’s splendor* be refined into the *shén* [神].

When *Heaven and Earth* harmonize, the *Nine Refining* processes wander.
We further request the *Primordial Harmony’s* mysterious blackness, winding about the form.
The *Pure Yang Dao-qi* permeates the inner and outer *luó* [罗].
The *Three Primordials* nurture, completing the form.

We humbly face the *Lingzhen*, chanting the *Precious Verses*, and bow repeatedly.

Next, burn the *Nine Refining Talisman Tablet*, then invoke the *Hymn of the Flowing Crystal of Metal and Wood*:

*"The Peach Blossom initiates the first movement,
Lush and verdant, the two green sprouts arise.
The wondrous use flows from the Golden Mother,
Naturally harmonizing the blossoms.
The *qi* and spirit congeal in the Primordial Palace,
The sacred things radiate with crimson mists.
Thus attaining the path of the living,
In silent obscurity, contracting with the Dao-family."*

Incense is offered again. We humbly report...

The **Nine Limitless Heavenly Emperors**—Idaśāna, Śākyamuni of Infinite Meditative Bliss and Infinite Life, Brahmā of the Mustard Seed, the Silent Tuoshu, the Non-Arrogant Pralambīya, the Responsive Dao of the Hollow Primordial, the Spirit-Transforming Brahmā, the High Void and Clear Bright, and the Thoughtless, Knotless, Loveless—

We humbly hear that the **Three Treasures** radiate their light, the **Nine Spirits** respond with marvel, formless yet manifest, bearing shape yet remaining insubstantial, wandering the boundless void while arrayed within yin and yang. They govern the rise and fall of the **Five Celestial Stems**, nurturing all ten thousand things to transformation and birth. Thus, the **Nine Qi** converge in unity, the **Three Qi** merge in virtue.

Now, in accordance with the prescribed rites, we refine and guide the departed soul of **[Name]**. First, we respectfully petition the **Wood Lord Great Emperor** and the **Metal Mother Supreme True One**, invoking the brilliance of the **Two Luminaries**, condensing the **Five Phases’ refined qi**, establishing the root and receiving the ancestral essence. From the boundless depths, the **precise essence** is born; the **qi** and spirit coalesce, faintly taking form.

We humbly pray to the **Nine Heavenly Emperors** to bestow **correct qi** upon the **Nine Passes**. The **Ten Extremes’ High Perfected Ones** contain the **Primordial Embryo** within the **Ten Moons**. The **flowing essence** mingles with chaos, nurturing the form within the **Mysterious**.

We respectfully petition the **Ninefold Qi of Huangyan** to encircle the **Ninefold layers of the embryo’s womb**, so that the **womb’s source** may propagate freely, ascending to Heaven to complete its formation.

We respectfully petition the **Ninefold Qi of the Hollow and Dark Purple Gate** to encircle the **Ninefold layers of the embryo**, so that the **embryo’s roots** may dissolve and descend to Earth to solidify its spirit.

We respectfully petition the **Ninefold Qi of the Long-Living Illuminated Immortal** to encircle the **Three Souls**, so that the **Soul Gates** may refine into the Dao, communicating with the spirits to attain the essence.

We respectfully petition the **Ninefold Qi of the Dark and Mysterious Phangan** to encircle the **Seven Po**, so that the **Po Gates** may close the passes, and the **Heavenly Kings** descend as Immortals to bring peace.

We respectfully petition the **Ninefold Qi of the High Perfected and Pure Fusion** to encircle the **Six Viscera**, so that the **stomach conduit** may generate saliva to harmonize reception.

We respectfully petition the **Ninefold Qi of the High Immortal Hollow Basket** to encircle the **Seven Orifices**, so that the **pores and openings** may sharpen clarity, and the **star hosts** may shine brightly to open the paths.

We respectfully petition the **Ninefold Qi of the True Spirit’s Transformation** to encircle the **Eight Scenes**, so that the **Three Departments and Eight Scenes** may fully manifest form and spirit, radiating light in the silent night to protect the body.

We respectfully petition the **Ninefold Qi of Natural Mysterious Illumination** to encircle the **body**, so that the **Three Passes and Five Viscera**, the **Six Viscera and Nine Palaces**, the **Golden Liquid and Jade Chamber**, the **Twelve Layers of Gates**, the **Purple Gates and Jade Pavilions**, and the **Thirty-Six Thousand Passages** may all root in their origins and begin to generate spirit. Thus, the spirit disperses the **qi**, filling it so that sound may resonate, and the spirit remains complete. Hair sprouts upon the body, and the **Ten Thousand Celestial Beings** descend to oversee its birth, completing its formation.

We, your servants, with utmost reverence and fervent supplication, prostrate ourselves repeatedly.

Next, we offer incense and recite the **Nine Qi Spirit-Transformation Heavenly Venerable**. For the **Three Qi** are the sovereigns of Heaven and Earth, and the **Nine Qi** are the ancestors of all things. Thus, the **Three** merge in virtue, the **Nine** in true yang—this is the ultimate function of Heaven and Earth.

Now, the **Nine Heavens** manifest their forms, yet the **Nine Knots** remain undivided. The **Ten Moons** bring forth completion, yet the **Tenfold encirclements** are difficult to dissolve. The **root has descended**, but the **flowing end** must still be partitioned. Further relying upon the **Imperial Perfected Ones**, from beginning to end, they protect and guide. The officials and assemblies labor without distraction, reciting the **Golden Chapter of Great Possession** to aid the **celebration of the departed’s rebirth**.

Next, we recite the **Nine Chapters**, then the **Five Emperors’ Talismans** for application.

We burn the **Blue Emperor’s Talisman** and recite the incantation:
*"We solemnly invoke the Liver as the Sovereign of the Azure Palace, the Unadorned Spirit—**Minor Yang Wood Essence, the Year Star’s qi**—to enter the transformed body and generate the Liver, where the **Three Souls** reside. The **Nine Wood Gods**, with their **Nine Thousand Spirit Officials**, swiftly descend the **true qi**, guarding the **camp and defense**, overseeing the **hair and skin**."*

We burn the **White Emperor’s Talisman** and recite the incantation:
*"We solemnly invoke the Lung as the Sovereign of the White Palace, the Pure Elemental Spirit—**Minor Yin Metal Essence, the Great White’s qi**—to enter the transformed body and generate the Lung, where the **Seven Po** reside. The **Seven Metal Gods**, commanding **Seven Thousand Spirit Officials**, descend to govern within, guarding the **camp and defense**, overseeing the **tendons and bones**, and the **teeth**."*

We burn the **Black Emperor’s Talisman** and recite the incantation:
*"We solemnly invoke the Kidney as the Sovereign of the Dark Palace, the Nourishing Precision Spirit—**Major Yin Water Essence, the Hour Star’s qi**—to enter the transformed body and generate the Kidney. The **Left Shoulder Boy** and **Right Shoulder Girl** reside there. The **Five Water Gods**, with their **Five Thousand Attendants**, govern within, guarding the **camp and defense**, overseeing the **blood and marrow**, and the **generation of essence**."*

We burn the **Red Emperor’s Talisman** and recite the incantation:
*"We solemnly invoke the Heart as the Sovereign of the Vermilion Palace, the Supreme One Commanding Spirit—**Major Yang Fire Essence, the Wandering Star’s qi**—to enter the transformed body and generate the Heart. The **Left Boy** and **Right Girl** reside there. The **Three Fire Gods**, with their **Three Thousand Attendants**, govern within, guarding the **camp and defense**, overseeing the **palaces and courts**, and the **souls and po**."*

We burn the **Yellow Emperor’s Talisman** and recite the incantation:
*"We solemnly invoke the Spleen as the Sovereign of the Yellow Court, the Ever-Present Transformed Spirit—**Earth Essence’s qi**—to enter the transformed body and generate the Spleen. The **Twelve Earth Gods**, commanding **Twelve Thousand Attendants**, govern within, guarding the **camp and defense**, overseeing the **flesh and muscles**, and the **transformation of the Four Limbs and blood vessels**, giving rise to the **Ten Thousand Spirits**. The **Void Sovereign’s Qi** flows throughout the body, generating **Twelve Thousand Radiant Spirit-Lights** and **Thirty-Six Thousand Hair-Pore Spirits**. The **Five Viscera** receive their essences, the **Ten Thousand Qi** endure eternally, and the **Hundred Spirits** merge in obscurity. Internally and externally, the **mysterious and dark** return to the embryo, ascending to pay homage to the **Imperial Sovereigns**."*

*Urgent, as the **Nine Heavenly Generating Spirit Emperors’ decrees** command.*

Next, we burn the **Great Brahman Hidden Words** and the **Soul-Protecting Talismans**. The **Soul-Protecting Talismans** are the **Nine Heavenly Treasures of the Original Heavenly Palace, Returning to Form and Restoring Nature**.

Next, we clarify the **Deceased’s Past Life Chapter**, reciting the incantation:
*"At the Hour of Yellow Brilliance, the Three Auspicious Ones ascend to the Celestial Courtyard.
The Azure Platform’s winged wheel flies, welcoming the Dao’s completion.
The **Commanding Spirit** presents the Imperial Edict, named the **Mysterious Degree Sovereign**.
Born in the **Great Vermilion Palace**, listed among the **Upper Officials of the Guest Hall**."*

*"Golden Gate contains the refined essence, guarding the soul’s Yellow Serenity.
Left hand bears the **Elemental Sovereign of the Original**, right hand seizes the **Jade-Yielding Spirit of Vermilion**.

Next, we proclaim the **Imperial Edict of Grace and Dismissal**:
The **Nine Chapters** are recited in full, the Five Elements manifest in life.
You who have received the **Dao’s boundless virtue**, must heed the **Highest True’s benevolent teachings**, purify your heart and turn toward the **Way**, listen closely and fulfill its command.

For the **Nine Heavenly Qi** generates the spirit, the **Three Primordial Essences** nurture its form.
When Yellow and White harmonize, the **Chaos of Formlessness** merges into unity.
The **Six Celestial Stems** circulate in cycles, the **Five Phases** interact in resonance—
mirroring Heaven, embracing Earth,
concealing Yin, emitting Yang,
then the Earth’s firm yet yielding nature
responds to Heaven’s measured degrees.
The **Ten Thousand Truths** align in order, the **Ten Thousand Phenomena** stand in array,
uniting with the **Dao**, transcending the True—
thus honored and exalted,
thereupon the head becomes **Kunlun Mountain**,
the hair the **Stars and Constellations**,
the brows the **Flowery Canopy**,
the eyes the **Sun and Moon**,
the nose the **Celestial Pillar**,
the ears the **Heavenly Windows**,
the mouth the **Heavenly Gate**,
and the face the **Divine Mirror**.
The **Five Sacred Peaks** and **Four Great Rivers**,
the **Nine Streams** and **Eight Tributaries**,
the **One Primordial** and **Two Polarities**,
the **Three Lights** and **Four Symbols**,
the **Five Phases** and **Six Harmonics**,
the **Seven Primordial** and **Eight Manifestations**,
the **Nine Palaces** and **Ten Directions**,
the **Thirty-Six Heavens** and **Thirty-Six Earths**—
all are present, each a marvel of the **Dao’s response**,
a nurturing of the **divine spirits**.

You must, therefore, cultivate **emptiness and purity**, extinguish desire,
rectify your thoughts and embrace **non-action**—
then the **Qi** nourishes the spirit, spirit and **Qi** unite,
**Qi** and essence condense,
returning to rebirth, ascending toward the **Land of Non-Such**.
How could this not bring joy?

Yet if you are agitated and turbid,
harboring lust and malice in your heart,
then you harm the spirit—
when the **Qi** is exhausted, the spirit departs;
the **Soul** sinks into the **Six Paths**,
the **Ethereal Vitality** labors in the **Three Trials**,
with no respite—
how could this not bring sorrow?

Even if the **Three Officials** increase your sins,
the **Seven Ancestors** bring misfortune,
cycle after cycle, birth after birth—
the suffering knows no end.

You can, through **embracing purity** and **cultivating the True**,
within the **Wisdom-Nature**, transcend to the **Land of Bliss**—
yet reflect upon the causes and conditions of good and evil,
for they must not be overlooked.

Further, we open the **Path of Darkness** for the departed spirits,
invoking the **Luminous Wisdom**,
praising the **virtues**.

Next, we recite the **Hymn of Wisdom**:
*'Wisdom generates the root of precepts,*
*The **True Dao** upholds the precepts as master.
From this arise the **Three Jewels**,
which the **High Celestial Immortals** revere and transmit.
Board this **Vessel of Non-Death**,
and in a flash, cross the **Great Expanse**.
At this moment of preaching the precepts,
all **Celestial Immortals** come to pay homage with bowed heads.*

Again, we prostrate and offer incense,
three obeisances, kneeling in reverence to speak.
We, your humble servants, have undertaken the **refining and guiding** of the departed soul,
daring to invoke the **Great Work**,
relying on the **Two Polarities** to nurture its form,
the **Nine Qi** to condense its body—
the **Ten Thousand Truths** gather at the **Three Fields**,
the **Ten Thousand Phenomena** array in the **Six Viscera**,
the **Hundred Passages** flow in harmony,
the **Seven Orifices** open in clarity,
the **Ethereal Vitality** stilled, the **Soul** at peace,
the spirit purified, the **Qi** bright—
thus returning to the path of life,
forever entrusting itself to the **True Rest**.

We, mere **ant-like lives** with petty duties,
depending on the **Law’s instruction**,
unable to fathom the **Mysterious Wind**,
yet respond to the command to pray for the **True**,
relying on the **Highest Benevolence** to rescue beings.
We have received the **Compassionate Truth of Zhongwei**,
and the **Grace of Qingguang**—
now the **refining of ranks** is complete,
the **affairs of the corpse** are done.

We pray for the **Dragon Chariot** and **Phoenix Palanquin**,
to return to the **Jade Capital**,
beneath the **Feathered Canopy** and **Rainbow Banners**,
once more ascending to the **Crimson Gate**.
Our hearts race through the **Vast Han**,
our thoughts soar to the **Layered Heavens**.
We further hope for **boundless mercy**,
and **greater bestowal of wondrous shelter**.

We, your unworthy servants, cannot express our deepest yearning—
we bow our heads, prostrate twice, in humble farewell.

**The Ninth Refinement of the Living Corpse**
**The Nine-Cup Ritual for the Divine Illumination Lamp—Talismans and Methods Follow**

We humbly submit that from the **Primordial Chaos** and **Original Beginning**, the **Three Qi** were concealed within the **Great Initial**. The divine aura radiates brilliance, spreading the **Nine Heavens** to the lofty extremes. The **Great Block** having been divided, the **Original Beginning** unfurls its diagram; divine essence nurtures the sacred, qi disperses in its netlike array, grace descends to the lower earth, and the **Law** governs both **humans and heavens**.

Thus, the **Golden Talisman** reveals its methods, the **Cloud Scrolls** unfold their teachings. Within the luminous void of the **Purple Micro Star** and **Jade Treasure**, the **Eastern Extremity’s Azure Mist** transforms above the **Emerald Beginning’s** first green. Its original form resembles a seal, blazing in all eight directions, its patterns descending with radiant brilliance, spanning a full **ten feet**. It conceals the **Ninefold Golden Framework**, dazzling the **Seven-Treasure Canopy Forest**. Marvelous qi coalesces, the sacred wind resounds in rhythm—when the **Altar Officials** petition, permission is granted to **guide and transmit**. The imprisoned are blessed, enlightened, and transformed.

Now, a certain person, with a **Great Brahman’s** sincere heart, prostrates before the **Great Mysterious**, praying for the **Five-Colored Radiance** to illuminate and shatter the **Nine Abysses’** dark prisons. We humbly pray that **ten thousand spirits** attend as **Sixfold Leaders** dispel calamities, distinguishing **good and evil** to guide the people, turning **humans and heavens** toward the **Dao**. Moving ceaselessly, they universally deliver without end, ascending to the **Formless**, merging with the **True**.

We solemnly kindle the **Northeast Cup Divine Lamp**, dispersing the **Imperial True Embryo’s** primordial **Yellow-Transforming Qi**. We humbly submit that the **Rotating Dipper** and **Shepherd’s Hook** emit the **Exalted Ascending Qi** of the **Ram’s Horn**. The **Nine Harmonies** and **Ten Unifications** divide the **Azure Mist’s** netlike patterns. Suspended in the **Long-Lasting Hall of Blessing**, below lies the **Northern Single’s** dark prison. As the year begins, all things reach their end.

Tonight, we solemnly kindle the **Northeast Cup Divine Lamp**, applying the **Idubadana Heaven’s** **Boundless Life-Generating Divine Treasure Talisman**. We humbly pray that the **Heavenly Treasure’s Golden Script**—the **Primordial Ancestral Qi**—opens the **Dragon Han’s** light, illuminating the **Double Darkness**. Thus, the **common mortal** attains the **Flying Immortal**, and the **dried bones** revive in the **Human Way**. Ascending to the **Formless**, they merge with the **True**. We **Deliver the Sacred and Supreme Heavenly Venerable**.

Next, burn the talisman, rotate and depart, reciting the **Idubadana Heaven’s Chapter**.

We solemnly kindle the **East Cup Divine Lamp**, dispersing the **Imperial True Soul’s** primordial **Long-Life Illuminating Immortal’s Qi**. We humbly submit that the **Yang Ascending Southeast** embodies the **Double Clarity’s** resplendent brilliance, **Compliance** in the **Central Rectitude**, speaking of all things’ **purity and order**. Dwelling by the **rivers and seas** yet not contending, stirring the **winds and thunders** in their clash, within the **Original Blessing’s** realm of **Virtuous Worth**, there is the **Venerable of Kindness and Deliverance**.

Tonight, we solemnly kindle the **East Cup Divine Lamp**, applying the **Brahman Supervisor’s** **Mustayana Heaven’s** **Divine Jade Talisman**. We humbly pray for the **Symbolic Wheel’s** transformation, the **Dragon’s Chin’s** descending light, wandering through the **Three Realms**, pardoning the **ten thousand lives’** sins, ascending to the **Formless**, carried by the **Dao’s** merging with the **True**. The **Jade Treasure’s Supreme Heavenly Venerable**.

Next, burn the talisman, rotate and encircle, reciting the **Mustayana Heaven’s Chapter**.

We solemnly kindle the **South Cup Divine Lamp**, dispersing the **Imperial True Spirit’s** primordial **Phanxi’s** **Dark and Mysterious Purple Gate’s Qi**. We humbly submit that within the **Three Qi’s Heaven**, the **Red Sovereign** is named the **Old Man of Vermilion Spirit**. Inside the **Double Yang Palace**, the **Jade Texts** refine the **Flowing Fire Courtyard**. At the moment all things meet, he preserves the **ten kalpas’** endless cycle. Seeking voices to save suffering, he responds to sensations, dividing his radiance.

Tonight, we solemnly kindle the **South Cup Divine Lamp**, applying the **Silent Futu Heaven’s** **Divine Jade Talisman**. We humbly pray that **ten million** receive deliverance, refined with **Jade Salve**. The **Nine Clans** become **Immortal**, granted **Golden Elixir**. The **Northern Treasury** dispels the **Great Demon’s** trials, the **Southern River** controls the **flood’s** disaster. Universally entering **Light**, they dwell in **Blessing**, ascending to the **Formless** after attaining the **Dao**. The **Mysterious True Ten-Thousand Blessings Heavenly Venerable**.

Next, burn the talisman, rotate and encircle, reciting the **Futu Heaven’s Chapter**.

We solemnly kindle the **Southwest Cup Divine Lamp**, dispersing the **Imperial True Storehouse’s** primordial **Five Immortals’ Central Spirit’s Qi**. We humbly submit that the **Earthly Vehicle** bears all things, yet does not claim the **Central Earth’s** position. The **Brahman Qi** flows in its **Whirling Pattern**, aligning with the **Well’s** **Forest of All-Encompassing** on its right. It broadly applies the **Great Void’s** virtue, high above the **Land of Renunciation and Tranquility**, with **ten thousand treasures** arrayed in solemnity, **hundreds of directions** subdued in awe.

Tonight, we solemnly kindle the **Southwest Cup Divine Lamp**, applying the **Bodhisattva’s** **Brahma’s** **Proud Music Heaven Emperor’s** **Divine Treasure Talisman**. We humbly pray that **ten million** divide their radiance, **hundreds of thousands** respond to their call, examining the **Nine Treasuries’** records of **life and death**, opening the **Eight Directions’** gates of **sin and blessing**. The **most lowly and insignificant** universally ascend to the **Dao’s shore**, without limit or end, all turning the **Law’s Wheel**. After attaining the **Dao**, they ascend to the **Formless**. The **Great Sacred Void Emperor of Heaven**.

Next, burn the talisman, rotate and encircle, reciting the **Brahma’s Chapter**.

We solemnly kindle the **West Cup Divine Lamp**, dispersing the **Imperial True Essence’s** primordial **Highest True’s** **Purifying Fusion’s Qi**. We humbly submit that the **Golden Spirit’s** **Ancient Sage** resounds in the **Emerald Green** and **Purple** celestial forests. The **Jade Realm’s** **Western That** looms over the **Floating Luo’s** peaks. The **Eight Awe-Inspiring** blazes, the **Seven Qi** hover in mist—stars divide the **Great White’s** essence, governing the **Lesser Yin’s** domain.

Tonight, we solemnly kindle the **West Cup Divine Lamp**, applying the **Void-Responding Voice Heaven’s** **Divine Treasure Talisman**.

We humbly pray that the **Multitudes of Sages** descend upon the hall, all **Heavenly Hosts** rejoice in Your arrival, the **Nine Abysses** open at night, and the **Sandalwood Groves** return to their original paths. The **Tenfold Wheel** revolves, and blessings arise anew in the coming fate.

All who dwell within the **Dharma Realm** enter the **Mysterious Gate**, and after attaining the **Dao/Way**, ascend to the **Formless**.

The **Great Sacred Supreme Emperor of Heaven**,
Next, burn the talisman, rotate and encircle, reciting the **Responding Transformation’s Voice Heaven’s Chapter**.

We humbly submit: the **Tenfold Wheel** revolves, the **Imperial Gates** open ninefold. The **Heavenly Vault** resounds, refining its essence through **Three Transformations**.

The **Primordial Yang’s** firm strength responds to the **Six Lines of Sovereign Virtue**. Dwelling in the **Ninth at the Fifth**’s exalted rank, residing at the **Extreme of Double Yang**, silent yet answered, sensing yet attuned.

Tonight, we solemnly kindle the **Northwest Cup Divine Lamp**, applying the **Spiritual Transformation’s Buddha’s Aid Heaven’s** **Divine Treasure Talisman**.

We humbly pray that the **Blessing of the Sovereign** flourishes through endless eons, and grace reaches all beings.

The **Clear and Cool Waters** restrain the **Ten Thousand Essences** in profound stillness. The **Open Sky** descends, binding the **Six Ghosts** within the **Luo’s** abyss. **Dao/Way and Virtue** thrive, and all beings—human and celestial—rejoice together, and after attaining the **Dao/Way**, ascend to the **Formless**.

The **Supreme Emperor of Heaven, Mysterious and Bright**,
Next, burn the talisman, rotate and encircle, reciting the **Clear and Bright Heaven’s Chapter**.

We solemnly kindle the **Upper Cup Divine Lamp**, dispersing the **Imperial True Essence’s** primordial **Natural Mysterious Illumination’s Qi** as the **Sacred Cavern’s** divine treasure.

We humbly submit: the **Supreme Sage of Supreme Truth**, where the **Five Realms** emerge beyond the **Three Realms’** bounds—**peakless, summitless**. The **Eight Directions** pay homage to the **Seven Treasures’ Palace**.

Uniting the **Primordial Heavenly Element**, governing the **Central and Intermediary Earth’s Extremes**, with **Awe-Inspiring Light** and **Virtuous Power** resounding.

Tonight, we solemnly kindle the **Upper Cup Divine Lamp**, applying the **Thoughtless, Knotless, Loveless Heaven’s** **Divine Treasure Talisman**.

We humbly pray that the **Great Dao of Non-Action** be revered by **Heavenly Sovereigns and Divine Sages**, dwelling in the **Gate of Compassionate Skillfulness**, manifesting the **Subtle and Radiant Light**.

May one body receive blessings, becoming a **Minister of the Golden Gates**. May the **Nine Clans** share grace, all entering the **Assembly of Purple Void**.

After attaining the **Dao/Way**, ascend to the **Formless**.

The **Emperor of Heaven, Jade and Void**,
Next, burn the talisman, rotate and encircle, reciting the **Loveless Heaven’s Chapter**.

The **Divine Lamp of Endless Light**,
Next, proclaim the **Nine Heavenly Sovereigns’ Manifestations**.

Previously, we announced the **Nine Cup Divine Lamps**, repenting and offering prayers for the **Five Afflictions’** dark obscurations.

We humbly pray that the **Eight Assemblies and Nine Lights** may stabilize **Heaven** and pacify the **Earth**. The **Three Realms and Five Afflictions** may depart from the **Dark Abyss**.

Refining and transforming all beings, grace pervading the **Cosmos**, with merit returned to the **Southern Supreme Sage**, the **Shakya’s** **Celestial Elder**.

Further, we pray to savor the **Highest Good**, awakening to the **Three Realms** as **Emptiness**. Attaining the **Nine Altars**, liberating all beings and universally revealing.

**The Scripture of the *Língbǎo* Infinite Life-Sustaining Way’s Upper Canon, Volume Sixty-Five, Complete.**
**The Scripture of the *Língbǎo* Infinite Life-Sustaining Way’s Upper Canon, Volume Sixty-Six, Complete.**

**The *Shénhǔ* Pursues and Captures the Spirit,**
**The *Shénhǔ* Hidden Scripture,**
**The Supreme One’s Northern Dao/Way, the Great Unity’s Purple Primordial, the Mixed Primordial Jade Tablet,**
**The *Shénhǔ* Hidden Scripture’s author—**
In ancient times, when the Celestial Master **Yè Zhēnrén** attained the Dao/Way,
he concealed this hidden scripture within the **Lónghǔ Shān**’s **Bìlǔ Cave**.
Engraved upon a stone, it reads:

---
*The Jade Tablet of the **Northern Kāi**’s Mysterious Dao/Way,*
*The Supreme One’s Northern Dao/Way, the Great Unity’s Purple Primordial,*
*The Mixed Primordial Jade Tablet,*
*The *Shénhǔ* Hidden Scripture,*
Is secretly stored within the **Northern Kāi’s** **Xuānfàn Palace**,
Within the **Supreme One’s Purple Treasury**,
Among the **Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper**,
In the Nine Heavens.

*The *Shénhǔ* Nine Sovereign Consorts,*
Oversee the **Lower Primordial** and the **Eight Extremes** of noble and ignoble,
The **Ten Directions’ Kings and Officials**, myriad clans and all kinds of people,
The **souls and spirits** of life and death,
The **limits of longevity**—whether prolonged or shortened,
The **departure or retention of spiritual awareness**,
The **length of fortune and destiny**,
All are subject to their governance.

*The world’s people are fourfold:*
The **Yí**, **Bānmán**, and **Jiǔzhōu**’s **Shí Dào**,
The **Liùróng Wǔdí**,
And the **Twelve Celestial Divisions**.
Under the **Heavenly Canopy**,
All ten thousand nations and myriad peoples,
From the **Nine Terraces** above,
Are all under their dominion.

*When a person is born into the world,*
The **Northern Dipper** bestows one portion of its divine spirit,
Manifesting within the **form** as **thirty-six thousand true spirits**.
The **Spirit-Father** and **Spirit-Mother** oversee the **Primordial Destiny**,
With a **great limit** of thirty-six thousand days,
And a **life-span** of one hundred and twenty years.

*If one adheres to the **Three Norms** and **Five Constants**,
Nurtures the **souls and spirits** and preserves the **vital essence**,
Does not commit evil deeds,
Nor cultivates benevolent virtues,*
When the lifespan is exhausted,
The **true spirits** return to the **Dipper’s Celestial Bureau**.
One spirit departs each day,
Until thirty-six thousand are fulfilled—
This is called the **Heavenly Term of Life**,
The **Dipper’s Extremes** decree death,
The **Tàiwēi** removes life,
And the **Heavenly Talismans** descend,
Reporting to the **Earthly Officials**.
According to their dwelling place,
The spirits and deities comply.

*The **Yang** takes the **soul**,
The **Yin** seizes the **spirit**,
The **Earth** collects the **vital fluids**,
The **Heaven** takes the **qi**,
The **fire and wind** disperse completely,*
And the **form** returns to **Great Yin**,
The **spiritual awareness** flees to the **Void**,
Subject to the **transformative forces of creation**,
Following one’s deeds to receive retribution,
Returning to the cycle of life and death,
Endless through the **ten thousand kalpas**.*

*If one cultivates virtue and performs meritorious deeds*
Upon the day of birth,
The **Jade Talismans** increase the calculations,
And the **Heavenly spirits** descend with benevolent **qi** into the body.

*If one commits evil and creates offenses,*
The **Earthly Officials** remove the calculations,
And the **spirits** flee with malevolent **qi** into the body.

*When returning to the **Dipper’s Bureau**,
Great evil diminishes lifespan,
Great virtue extends lifespan,
Minor evil removes the calculations,
Minor virtue adds to the calculations.
One calculation equals three days,
One lifespan equals one year.
A **memorial calculation** of twelve days,
A **memorial lifespan** of twelve years—
If the calculations are exhausted, the lifespan is removed,
And the **true spirits** depart.

*If one commits great evil,*
The lifespan is exhausted and the calculations are severed,
The **true spirits** depart and the **spiritual awareness** returns to suffering.
*If the evil deeds are not great,*
The lifespan is diminished and the spirits are collected,
Demons and ghosts invade,
Benevolent spirits retreat,
And the **empty corpse** wanders in peril,
Suffering distress and calamity,
Haunted by its form.

*Even minor evil deeds*
Reduce the calculations and remove the spirits,
Disturbing the **souls and spirits**,
And the **malevolent qi** brings illness.

*If one can repent, abandon evil,*
Cultivate virtue and perform meritorious deeds,
Establish **virtue/power** and practice **benevolence**,
Observe **fasting and purification** with earnest cultivation,
And move the **August Sovereign**,
The **true spirits** descend anew,
The **spiritual awareness** becomes luminous,
The **souls and spirits** find peace and joy,
And all spirits rejoice in attendance.

*With days and years accumulated,*
All spirits surround the body,
And the spirit can **ascend in form**.

*Greatly, one ascends in broad daylight as an Immortal,*
*Moderately, one attains **spirit-body dissolution** and the Dao/Way,*
*Slightly, one prolongs life for many years.*

This is what is called
**Heaven’s Assistance to Virtue**,
**Heaven’s Aid to the Virtuous**,
**Distant yet Hearing the Lowly**,
**Responding Like an Echo**.

*The **Supreme One’s Secret Edicts** state:*
“Doing good, benevolent **qi** arrives;
Doing evil, malevolent **qi** arrives.”

---
*The **Northern Dao/Way’s** Mysterious Bureau and the **Dipper’s** Celestial Palace*
Each palace and bureau contains
**hundreds of millions of Nine Sovereign Celestial Officials**,
**Hundreds of millions of Embroidered-Robe Envoys**,
**Hundreds of millions of Golden Boys and Jade Girls**,
**Hundreds of millions of Heavenly Generals and Soldiers**,
Descending to the mortal realm,
Recording the **virtues and vices** of all people under the ten thousand nations,
Without the slightest discrepancy.
Among them, the most honored are the
**Nine Sovereign *Shénhǔ* Consorts**,
The **Great Saints** on either side of the *Shénhǔ*,
The ***Shénhǔ*’s Spirit-Mother** overseeing life and death,
And then there are the
***Shénhǔ* Envoys Pursuing Souls**,
***Shénhǔ* Officials Pursuing and Capturing***.

*If one can cultivate virtue and perform meritorious deeds,*
Abandon malevolence and restrain desires,
Eliminate falsehood to support the true,
Their names will be listed in the **Heavenly Bureau of the Supreme One**,
And their station will oversee the **Supreme One’s Northern Dao/Way**.

They can then
**Invoke the descent of myriad spirits**,
Assist the **Great Dao/Way**,
**Revive the dead and restore the departed souls**,
**Sever demons and rebuke the Netherworld’s officials**,
**Command the Underworld’s bureaucracy**,
**Record fortunes and extend life**,
**Avert disasters and repel calamities**,
To earn **Heavenly Merit**,
And upon completing their virtues,
Ascend in broad daylight as an Immortal.

**The Five Dipper’s Mysterious Bureau**

*The Sovereign of the **Huángrén** states:*
*The **Eastern Dipper**, the **Calculating Sovereign**,
Is the **Emerald Yang’s** Primordial **Qi**’s bureau,
Where the **Emerald Spirit** and the **Nine-Qi Heavenly Sovereign** preside.

*The **Western Dipper**, the **Recording Sovereign**,
Is the **Luminous Spirit’s** bureau of nurturing and purity,
Where the **Luminous Spirit** and the **Seven-Qi Heavenly Sovereign** preside.

*The **Southern Dipper**, the **Upper Life-Sustaining Sovereign**,
Is the **Scarlet Flame’s** bureau of **Danling** and the **Great Abyss**,
Where the **Danling True Spirit** and the **Three-Qi Heavenly Sovereign** preside.

*The **Northern Dipper**, the **Descending Sovereign of Death**,
Is the bureau of **Yùjué**’s **Mid-Heaven** and **Harmony**,
Where the **Five-Qi Heavenly Sovereign** presides.

*The **Central Dipper**, the **Great Kāi Sovereign**,
Is the bureau overseeing all spirits,
Where the **Yellow Spirit** and the **One-Qi Heavenly Sovereign** preside.

---
*The **Eastern Dipper**, the **Calculating Sovereign**,
Bestows one portion of **Qi** upon a person when they are born,*
And the **Five Emperors** supervise life,
The **Earthly Officials** record names,
The **Celestial Bureau** oversees the registers,
The **great** becomes **lifespan**,
The **small** becomes **calculations**.

*All who are born into the world*
Are granted a **lifespan of one hundred and twenty years**.

A single *jì* (cycle) spans twelve years—
a thousand two hundred *suàn* (fates) in total.

Should the **Earthly Officials** assess deeds of great virtue or transgression,
they shall present them to the Celestial Bureau for review,
and thus extend one’s *suàn*—
three hundred sixty for the grand,
one hundred twenty for the lesser.

Should the **Earthly Officials** determine crimes grave and manifold,
they shall confiscate one’s *suàn*.
If crimes are not yet deep,
they shall merely reduce it.
Thus, years are added or subtracted,
each case graded with precision—
no discrepancy, not even a hair’s breadth.

The **Calculating Sovereign** of the Eastern Dipper,
clasping the seal and bearing the banner,
holds authority most stern and weighty.

For when a person dies,
their *yin* soul is claimed by the **Northern Void**,
and if their *tian shù* (heavenly measure) is unfulfilled,
or if crimes were committed,
they are confined to the **Fighting Dippers**,
known as **Tian-Yī Běi Zuò** (Heavenly Unity’s Northern Punishment).

Then the living bear their guilt—
the wealthy lose their heirs,
the poor multiply descendants;
men meet violent ends,
women suffer miscarriage or childbirth woes;
some are dragged through lawsuits,
their fortunes wasted;
others fall to plague or festering sores,
years of hardship,
decades of suffering—
all these are the departed’s *yin* souls undergoing judgment,
bringing calamity to the living world.

Yet if one performs meritorious deeds,
rectifies the heart and follows the Dao,
with unwavering loyalty and filial piety,
accumulating *yin* merit,
their name is inscribed on the **Left Register**,
and the **Magical King** recommends them—
the heavens rejoice in celebration.

Then the soul ascends to the **Southern Dipper**,
the *po* (corporeal soul) refines in the **Cavern of Yang**,
pardoned from the *yin* world’s soul-trial,
redeemed from the *yang* world’s karmic debt.

If one dies young,
and if guilt is measured—
whether crimes were committed—
they are detained at **Southern Peak**,
assigned to the mortal realm,
temporarily governing a locality,
awaiting their term’s end,
passing through the **Northern Dipper’s Wénqǔ Palace**.
There, they receive the **Great Brahman’s** celestial decree,
the *zhēnwén* (true scripture) of fate’s accord,
and are sent to the **Southern Palace**,
where their fortune is weighed—
and they are reborn in the human world,
their noble or lowly, male or female form determined.

But if one dies of old age,
with no deeds to record,
no conduct to commend,
their sins piled like mountains,
no virtue revealed—
then they are directly imprisoned in **Tángyōu**,
to endure the *yin* judgment,
through countless *eons*,
never seeing light again,
their form reshaped into strange beasts,
forever losing their human essence—
truly a cause for sorrow and lament.

The **Primordial Emperor of Supreme Origin**, moved by boundless compassion, observed all beings—few doing good, many committing evil—sinking into the **Five Paths**, condemned to servitude in the **Three Realms**, enduring suffering across ten thousand *eons* without end.

Thus, He manifested **Great Compassion and Mercy**, transmitting the **Great Law**, dispersing the **Primordial Qi** of the **Mixed Void** and the **Jade Tablets’ seals**, scattering the **True Scripture of the Celestial Writings**, the **Secret Edicts of the Immortals**, inscribed on **Jade Tablets and Golden Books**. He entrusted the **Soul-Catching Net of the Numinous Treasure**, marking the chapters to be followed.

Those of the **Dao** act as His agents, transforming and universally rescuing the deluded. Though the **Law’s** methods vary—whether through talismans, officials, or spells—all obey the **Emperor’s Command**, invoking the **Cauldron’s Decisions** and **Magical Incantations** to summon and seize from the **Mystic Chief of the Northern Darkness**.

This is the **Boundless Salvation of All Beings**—none left uncrossed, none left unfulfilled.

Thus, practitioners of the **Dao** must know this:

When summoned, preserve your body like a **dead tree**, both hands holding the **Jade Purity Decisions** to your heart. Focus within on the **True Fire** blazing fiercely, burning to ashes. Then reverse your left hand to **Wu**, right hand to **Zi**, clasp your waist, and visualize the **True Water** in your kidneys churning like a wheel, mingling with the fire. Suddenly, a gust of wind scatters the ashes—**not a trace remains**.

Then strike your teeth **twelve times**, face the **Heavenly Gate**, and inhale the **Primordial Ancestral Qi** twelve breaths. Retain your breath briefly, and visualize a **purple cloud** entering through the **Heavenly Gate**, ascending to your **Forehead Palace**. Next, sense within your **Middle Palace** the **yellow and white qi**, spiraling outward to merge with the purple cloud.

Imagine your body as the **Primordial Emperor of Supreme Origin**, donning the **High Purity Crown and Robes**. Then visualize the **Grand Sovereign of the Supreme One** from the **Eastern Extremity Palace**, descending from the void before you, seated upon a **Nine-Headed Lion Throne**, holding a **willow branch and pure water**.

Again, take the **Green Primordial Qi** from the **Supreme Sovereign’s** crown and merge it with the **Primordial Qi**. This transforms into a **radiant treasure-light**, enveloping your body. Then visualize the **purple cloud and jade mist qi** arriving before you, where **divine officials, tiger-headed deities, jade boys, and jade girls**, along with **talisman scribes**, appear, bearing seals and nodes.

You then wave the **Decisions** over their **ears and eyes**. When the **drumming ceases**, channel your qi forward, burn incense, and declare your purpose.

Strike your teeth again, advance **twelve Ding-Gang steps**, turn to face north. Both hands form the **Divine Tiger Seal**, thumbs and middle fingers interlocked. Recite the incantation:

*"Om GuShaLuQiRongZha [missing character] She!"*

Upon completion, loudly summon:

*"I invoke the **Divine Tiger Lords, the Chief Marshal, and the Officials**—or the **Three Department Soul-Pursuers**—to come before this altar and hear my decree."*

Then visualize the invocation:

*"I bear the **Primordial Emperor’s mighty seals and dragon-script decrees**, wielding the **Numinous Treasure of the Mystic Origin** and the **Divine Tiger’s Nether Realm**. You must heed my command—**terrifying in might, fierce in presence**—dispelling the **darkness of the Underworld**, distinguishing the **paths of life and death**. Though the suffering may not yet be transcended, you must act with **compassion and seize the souls**. Following the **Jade Tablets’ edicts**, proceed directly to the **Heavy Springs**, gathering the **yin-souls** to restore their bodies, returning the **yang** to complete their forms. Reveal their **karmic retributions**, making them manifest before the **Mystic Altar**. Let all qi align with the **Immortal Way**, universally receiving salvation and liberation. Open the **Eight Gates of Marvelous Dao**, extracting them from the **Nether Pass**. Do not falter in resolve, lest the **True Primordial Teaching** be abandoned. **Urgent! Swift execution!**"

After the invocation, strike your teeth **nine times**, channel the qi into the **Decisions**, and burn them according to the **Law**.

The **Master** instructs:

*"For all **Numinous Treasure** rituals—whether summoning generals, refining souls, or retrieving lost spirits—use the **left middle finger** and the **right Yi-Shen Decisions**, silently focusing on the **Supreme Sovereign of the Eastern Extremity**, the **Green Primordial Emperor**, inhaling His qi seven times. Swallow one breath of **Green Primordial Qi** into the **Dan Tian**. Then visualize the **Dan Tian qi** merging with the **Green Primordial Qi**, forming a cloud that pierces the **Mingmen**, transforming your body into the **Supreme Sovereign of the Supreme One**."*

**Hun Yuan Jade Talisman** (化元律魄星飞泽)
*[Inscribed on a piece of **kui wood** seven *cun* long, three *cun* wide, two *fen* thick, in red ink]*
*"Proclamation to the Three Realms and Ten Directions on the means of birth and death, to retrieve the living and dead souls."*

Alternatively, inscribed on **white silk** seven *cun* long, three *cun* wide, in red ink, stored in a square vessel with water, alongside the **Return-to-Life Talisman**, held over the corpse while reciting the **Soul-Rallying Chant**, burning the Jade Talisman beneath the deceased’s nose—within a day, or even if death was sudden, the soul may be **recalled, the spirit revived, and the corpse restored**.

If the **Great Destiny** has not yet been exhausted, pray to Heaven for life.
If the **term of life and fortune** has ended, hasten to deliver the soul.
Should the deceased not have **pure merit within**, even if prayers ascend to Heaven and **purple pills** are offered to revive the corpse, or grand **rituals** are held at the **Dark Emperor’s** seat, the soul cannot long linger before rebirth.

**Sun-Day Talisman**: *Hun Yuan Jade Talisman of the Divine Tiger and Dark Mysteries*
**Moon-Day Talisman**: *Hun Yuan Jade Talisman of the Divine Tiger and Dark Mysteries*
**Yang Talisman**
**Yin Talisman**

**Transformation and Subjugation of the Mighty Stars**—*Hun Yuan Jade Talisman of the Divine Tiger and Dark Mysteries* is invoked.
**Mixed Primordial and Grand Pacification**—*Hun Yuan Jade Talisman of the Divine Tiger and Dark Mysteries* is invoked.
**Origination and Liberation of Vital Essence**—*Hun Yuan Jade Talisman of the Divine Tiger and Dark Mysteries* is invoked.
**Gathering of Soul and Spirit in the Obscure**—*Hun Yuan Jade Talisman of the Divine Tiger and Dark Mysteries* is invoked.
**Dark Celestial Radiance**—*Hun Yuan Jade Talisman of the Divine Tiger and Dark Mysteries* is invoked.
**Aerial Dominion and Command**—*Hun Yuan Jade Talisman of the Divine Tiger and Dark Mysteries* is invoked.
**Grace Extending to the Hidden and Penetrating**—*Hun Yuan Jade Talisman of the Divine Tiger and Dark Mysteries* is invoked.

The method is to contemplate the **Fighting Star’s** direction and chase the star to seize its *qi*, then blow it into the talisman.
First, the *Hun Yuan Jade Talisman of the Divine Tiger’s Soul-Subjugating Spirit* is to be recited.
Second, the *Hun Yuan Jade Talisman of the Divine Tiger’s Spirit-Subjugating Spirit* is to be recited with the *Hao Wen* invocation.
On **Sun-Day**, gather the form; on **Moon-Day**, gather the form.
**Supreme One’s** Northern *Zuo* and **Celestial One’s** Northern *Kui* bear the *Hun Yuan Jade Talisman of Dark Mysteries and Mixed Primordial*, inscribed in **True Scripture** with purple text, and the **Dark Emperor’s** *Hun Yuan Jade Talisman*.

The *Divine Tiger Talisman* is used to summon and subjugate the departed souls of a specific region, compelling them to come before the **Soul-Treasury’s Dark Hall**, where they kneel before the **Triple Jewel’s** august presence, hearing the **Dharma**, listening to the **Sutra**, receiving the talisman and taking the precepts, and receiving extraordinary grace.

Without delay, execute this swiftly. Where the *Divine Tiger* arrives, ten thousand spirits shall reverently obey, transmitted by wind and fire like couriers.

**Year** **Month** **Day** **Hour**—*Order Issued*.
**Position** **Title** **Name**—*Subject dutifully executes*.
**Seal Cover**—*Position Title Name* receives the *Jade Talisman* and dutifully executes.
**Reverse Inscription**—*Hun Yuan Jade Talisman of the Divine Tiger and Dark Mysteries* issued to summon the departed souls of a certain region.

**Talisman Case**—*Hun Yuan Jade Talisman of the Divine Tiger* issued to summon the souls of a certain region.
*Position Title Name* solemnly seals this.

The **region’s** guilty and suffering souls, all spirits of the **Imperial Court**,
The **Supreme Sovereign** declares: For all who use the *Jade Talisman* and press the **Fighting Star** of the deceased’s birth year, corresponding to their **Lunar Mansion**, beneath the talisman’s proper star, inscribe the names of the souls being summoned.

If performing a **Universal Salvation**, simply write “all souls—countless myriads of ancestors, suffering spirits, lonely souls, and lingering spirits”—and append the *Jade Talisman* with the **Divine Edict’s** inscribed text.
If performing a **Single Salvation**, use the **Celestial Scripture’s** thunderous seals.
If performing a **Universal Salvation**, use **True Scripture**.

On the night of the altar’s construction, or the following morning at dawn, use the **Messenger’s True-Form Talisman**, along with the **Two Passes** and the *Jade Talisman*, and burn them in the **Fiery Flame**. The Messenger proceeds ahead, bearing the talisman and command, to summon the departed and ensure their timely arrival.

**Supreme Primordial Jade Talisman for Summoning Souls—Iron Vow**
The **Supreme Sovereign** declares: For those who wish to summon and honor the **suddenly deceased**, an **Iron Vow** must be used to subjugate them.

The method is to inscribe with *female sulfur* and *cinnabar* seals, calling and summoning the departed souls beneath their proper stars, recording their names, birth years, months, days, and the place where their bodies perished and were buried. If the names are numerous, list them beneath the *Jade Talisman*; if the years, months, days, or hours are not recorded, explain them meticulously beneath the talisman. Burn them with the **offerings of faith**, the **Two Passes**, and the *Jade Talisman* in the **Fiery Flame**.

**Exhortation of the Infant and Stabilization of the Wandering Soul** is the **Yin Name** of the **Seven Primordial Lords**.
**Transformation of the Primordial and Flight of the Wandering Soul** is the **inner taboo** of the **Lunar Mansions’** **Lady of the Stars**.

This is the essence of the **Northern Dipper**, regulating **Yin and Yang**, gathering their souls and spirits, forming their bodily apparitions, and then subjugating them.
Why? Because the **suddenly deceased** are entangled by **Yin-qi**, causing their minds and spirits to be inverted and lost, their **True Essence** wandering astray.

After death, their **Yang souls** vanish, their **Yin-qi** obstructed by barriers, unable to see the light. Their souls depart, their spirits scatter.
Thus, the **Supreme Sovereign**, in compassion, establishes this **Vow-text** to subjugate them—this is what is called the **Soul-Treasury’s Infinite Salvation**.

**General Formula**—*Soul-Treasury Grand Dao Master*

The **Soul-Treasury Grand Dao Master** hereby, on this **month** **day**, in accordance with the above petition, records and submits for imperial decree beyond the **Celestial Court’s** edicts.

Now, in response to the petition, the **Supreme Sovereign’s** **Primordial Dao** descends—**Great Unity’s** **Supreme One’s** **Soul-Retrieving Jade Talisman**—received and entrusted to the **Soul-Retrieving Envoys**, who proceed to the **Yin Pass** to subjugate the wandering souls of the deceased **Certain [Name] and others**, bringing them before this **Altar-Hall**.

**Below are the names of the deceased** inscribed on the **Jade Talisman**:

**Right side:**
**Supreme One’s Northern Blessing, Celestial Unity’s Purple Primordial.**
**Northern Dipper’s Mysterious Darkness, Great Unity’s Jade Talisman.**
**Divine Tiger’s Command Talisman**, descending directly to the **Ten Directions and Three Realms**, the **Living Plane and Death Realm**, to retrieve and subjugate the aforementioned wandering souls of **Certain [Name] and others**, bringing them to pay homage at this **Altar-Hall** before the **Supreme Sovereign**, to receive **Celestial Grace**.

**Officials of the Ten Thousand Deities**, open the passes and clear the paths—execute this swiftly, without delay.

**Year** **Month** **Day** **Hour** issued.

**The Dao-Master of the Soul-Treasury**, in compliance with the **Divine Tiger’s Primordial Unity Jade Talisman’s** summons, **Certain [Name]**, submits this decree.

**Inner Seal:**
**The Dao-Master of the Soul-Treasury**, **Surname** **Name**, receives the **Jade Talisman** and executes this decree.

**Postscript:**
**Supreme Sovereign’s Primordial Unity Jade Talisman** summons the wandering souls of **Certain [Name] and others**.

**Outer Envelope:**
**Supreme Sovereign’s Primordial Unity Jade Talisman**, **Divine Tiger’s Command Talisman**, issued to the **Ten Directions**.

**The Dao-Master of the Soul-Treasury**, **Surname Certain**, respectfully seals this.

To the **Ten Directions’ Boundless World** and the **Nine Abyssal Hells’** **Officials of the Ten Thousand Deities**, the **Jade Talisman’s Command Incantation** proclaims:

*"Hidden scriptures of the Jade Talisman descend to the Northern Capital.
Prisoners of the Netherworld, heed the divine command.
Long nights of torment now cease, grievances pardoned.
Cross the Solar Path, face the Jade Void.
Swiftly, as the **Pure Celestial Sovereign’s** decree."*

**Dispatch of the Divine Tiger’s Summoning Ritual:**
When issuing the **Jade Talisman**, provide **tea, wine, seasonal fruits, gold coins**, and **twelve divisions of cloud-horses**. Bear the **Left Dipper Seal**, wield the **Right Sword Formula**, cross the waist—embody the **Soul-Treasury’s Celestial Venerable**.

**Invocation:**
*"Now we unveil the Yellow Register’s sacred canon,
Conducting the Soul-Treasury’s ritual rites."*

The **Mysterious Grace** spreads widely to the Netherworld,
The **Sacred Benevolence** pervades the shadowy realm,
Releasing the departed souls to attend the altar for salvation.
Yet fearing the **Gloomy Pass** is obstructed,
And the **Path of Darkness** fraught with peril,
With many hindrances yet to overcome,
They have not yet arrived as hoped.

Now, with **sincere resolve**, we first summon forth.
With **devoted intent**, we invoke the **Three Celestial Officials’ Direct Envoys**,
The **Divine Tiger Generals**,
To **summon the Netherworld officials** and **Soul-Pursuing Messengers**.
May they **heed the sacred rites** and **descend to our piety**,
**Summoning the departed souls** to attend the altar for salvation,
Arriving on **wind-horses and cloud-chariots** to the **Law Assembly**.

With **devoted intent**, we invoke the **Jade Altar Immortal of Southern Ling’s Central Bureau**,
With **unobstructed divine power** and **Soul-Pursuing Messengers**.
May they **obey the Imperial Decree above** and **align with filial devotion below**,
**Summoning the departed souls** to attend the altar for salvation,
Arriving on **wind-horses and cloud-chariots** to the **Law Assembly**.

With **devoted intent**, we invoke the **Immortal of the Northern Celestial Bureau of the Purple Extremity**,
To **summon the divine officials** and **Soul-Pursuing Children**.
May they **ride the dragon and mount the phoenix**,
**Swift as flying carriages**,
**Summoning the departed souls** to attend the altar for salvation,
Arriving on **wind-horses and cloud-chariots** to the **Law Assembly**.

Next, we recite the **Incantation for Summoning the Living Spirit and Capturing the Soul**:
*"The **Returning Yellow Banner** of **Taiwei** unfurls,
The **Soul-Capturing Standard** of **Wu Ying** is raised.
We summon the **Long Night Bureau**,
To open salvation for the **Souls of Rebirth**."*

Again, we intone:
*"With incense burned today,
We offer to the **Three Celestial Soul-Pursuing and Spirit-Capturing Messengers**,
The divine officials and attendants,
Who, hearing this summons, descend to the **fasting altar**,
Granting passage through the **Gloomy Pass**,
Ranked in their proper stations.
Mindful of our **sincere and humble offerings**—
**Wine, libations, rare delicacies**—
May you graciously accept them."*

Next, we burn the **talisman**, read the **decree**, offer incense, and present **tea and wine**.

Next, we recite the **Incantation for Translocating the Spirit and Summoning the Soul**:
*"The **Decree’s Power** pierces the **Nether Mists**,
The **Soul-Capturing Standard** rides the **Dawn Wind**.
The **Spirit is Translocated** beyond the **Northern Bureau**,
The **Flying Sandals** ascend to the **Southern Palace**."

Again, we humbly petition the **Three Celestial Soul-Pursuing and Spirit-Capturing Messengers**,
The divine officials and attendants,
May they **hear this summons** and **respond to our prayers**,
Transmitting our **fasting sincerity**,
Together adhering to the **Sacred Teachings**,
Soaring through heaven and earth,
Crossing waters and riding winds,
Reaching the **Three Realms in an instant**,
The **Soul-Pursuing Mirror** swiftly manifesting in a moment.

Thus, with **heartfelt devotion**, we pray,
Committing to the **Divine Might**,
That the **fasting rites be complete** and **meritorious deeds fulfilled**.
Next, we offer **incense and wine**.

Next, we recite the **Green Celestial Sutra of Rescue from Suffering**:
*"The **Green Splendor’s Wisdom-Power** rescues the **Encompassed Souls**,
Seeking voices to shatter the **Iron Citadel**.
Boundless aid follows the **Vow’s Force**,
Radiant Light universally illuminates the **Gloomy Gates**.
Where the **Spiritual Wind** fans, **Flames of Torment** vanish,
Where the **Law’s Rain** falls, **Decaying Glory** revives.
Infinite **Compassion** saves all,
The departed all behold the **Benevolent Sage**."

Again, we offer incense,
Nourishing the **Three Celestial Soul-Pursuing and Spirit-Capturing Messengers**,
The divine officials and attendants.

This **Altar’s Rites** now complete the **Gloomy Pass Summons**,
Awaiting the **harmonized response**,
Swiftly dispatching the **talisman** to summon the **Soul-Spirits**,
Guiding the departed by the **standard** to attend the altar for salvation,
To **attest to their ascent**,
The **fasting rites complete**, their names **inscribed in the Celestial Register**.

Next, we offer **incense and wine**.

Finally, we **summon the departed**.

**Preserving the Body as the Celestial Treasure Sovereign of Nourishing Life,**
From the East, stepping to the West-North,
Taking the **Three Celestial Qi** from the **Heavenly Gate** to blow upon oneself,
Facing North, standing erect,
Reciting the **Pure Clarity Decisive Spell** with incantations.

**Golden Radiance** revolves harmoniously across the **Seven Celestial Axes**,
The **Flying Ganges Divine Tiger** opens the **Gloomy Pass**.
Reversing the **Heavenly Cycle**, treading the **Mysterious Thread**,
Returning the **Pure Primordial Embryo** to stabilize the **Auspicious Orchid**.
**Expansive Support** mirrors the **Imperial Alaya**, the **Luminous Platform** bears the **Auspicious Omen of the Wheel**.
In **Harmonized Unity**, the **Seven Spirits** become one household,
**Separation and Reunion** naturally yield the **Jade Flower**.

The **Mysterious Standard** of the **Northern Constellation** governs life and death,
The **Supreme Dao** breathes, its **Root and Stem** flourishing.
I bear the **Jade Talisman** with the **Golden Tiger Script**,
Ten thousand spirits reverently obey, none dare disobey.

Should any defy my **Great Dao**,
You must resign your office—**Dao cannot be fulfilled**.

**Swiftly, as the Northern Constellation’s Worthy Consort, the Purple Micro Lady’s Song-Chapter Decree commands!**

Left hand holds the **Pure Clarity Decisive Spell**,
Right hand grasps the **Jade Talisman**,
Incantation:
*"Jade Talisman of the **Mysterious Heaven**,
Divine Tiger’s **Talismanic Script**,
**Primordial Unity’s True Essence**,
Uniting with the **Talisman’s Qi**.
**Taiyi’s Mysterious Darkness**,
Controlling the **Crossing Ferry**,
**Pursuing Souls, Capturing Spirits**,
Opening **Yang, Initiating Yin**,
Ten thousand spirits reverently listen,
Dare they not come to greet?

**Divine Tiger and Jade Maiden**,
**Divine Officer and Chief Attendant**,
**Great Saint of the Divine Tiger**,
**Lady’s Inner Taboo**,
**Soul-Pursuing Messengers**,
**Spirit-Capturing Soldiers**,
Receiving the **Talisman’s Command**,
At one summons, swiftly arrive.
Proclaim to the **Cold Court**,
No delay permitted.
**Pursuing Souls, Capturing Spirits**,
Forms and shadows manifest.
**Meritorious Deeds** ascend to the **Jade Sovereign**,
Come to this **Law Assembly**.

**Swiftly, as the Decree of the Pure Clarity Celestial Emperor!**

**Fighting Ganges**—
Step to the **Zeal Star**, advance to the **Three Platforms**, reverse the **Ganges** into the **Fighter’s Mouth**.
Internally recite the **Incantation**, read the **Pass Key**, burn it together with the **Jade Talisman**,
Trusting in water, wielding the sword,
Burn the **Three Messengers’ Talismans’ ashes**,
In the left palm, recite the **Pure Clarity Decisive Spell**, chanting the incantation seven times.

*"Yellow Emperor’s Three Treasures Sovereigns**,
**Purple Cloud Ascends to Heavenly Qi**,
**Capturing the Nine Netherworld Souls**,
**Great Mysterious Boundless Reach**.
All become natural beings,
The **Underworld holds no confinement**.
Opening the **Gate of Radiance**,
Awakening the **True Dao’s Innate Wisdom**.

**Swiftly, as the Decree commands!**
**Spit saliva once.**

**"The Heavenly One’s Northern Decree**—
The **Supreme One’s Purple Origin**, the **Northern Sovereign’s Mysterious Pattern**,
The **Divine Tiger’s Mysterious Lord**. Within the **Fighter’s Mouth** stands the **Great Sage**,
The **Jade Maiden** pursues souls. **Ten thousand spirit soldiers** descend with me in response.
**One breath, one call**—they enter my **seal**.

They emerge with the **qi**, they move with the **qi**.
A myriad transformations—**origin, vitality, power, constancy**.
Swiftly, as the **Divine Tiger’s Decree** commands!
Recite the incantation seven times, then **spit saliva once more** toward the **Ten Directions**.

**Next, the Dispatching Decree**—
The **Supreme Spirit’s Corporeal Dao**, the **Divine Mechanism’s Purple Strategy**,
The **Nine Qi Clouds’ Manifestation**, the **Divine Emperor’s Decree** to summon.
The **Divine Tiger and Jade Maiden**, the **Spirit Lord’s Chief Scribe**,
The **Soul-Pursuing Messengers** swiftly hasten to the **Living Realm**.
Take back the **Path of Death**—within the **talisman’s core**, the departed souls,
Swiftly attend the **Law Assembly**, receiving the **Spirit Treasures’ merit** for ascension.

**Dispatching the Divine Tiger’s Pass Key**—
The **Divine Tiger’s威灵** summons ghosts and gods.
The **Nine Pure Talismans’ Command** descends directly to **Tingting’s Court**.
At the **Mysterious Platform of Splendor**, the soul’s form appears instantly.
No hiding allowed—**the Golden Horse Relay** proceeds.
Swiftly, as the **Jade Pure Emperor’s Decree** commands!

**Dispatching the Three Messengers’ Pass Key**—
The **Three Divisions** pursue souls, their **威灵** unfurled.
Each division leads **Spirit Soldiers** straight to the **Netherworld’s Gates**.
They summon soul and spirit, swiftly revealing their **true forms**.
No hiding allowed—**the Golden Horse Relay** proceeds.
Swiftly, as the **Jade Pure Emperor’s Decree** commands!

**Left and Right Divine Tiger’s Two Great Sage Talismans**—
The **feminine Right** (*Wuren*), the **masculine Left** (*Dali Feng*), called **Flying Talismans**.
Cut **red silk** and **white silk**, each **four inches nine fen** long,
Use powdered ink to inscribe, invoking the **Divine Tiger’s Hall** for the **Divine Tiger’s scriptures**.
Burn them together in one place—no scattering of their forms.

First, recite the **Northern Emperor’s Incantation**;
Then, invoke the **writing brush**, drawing **qi from the southeast** to blow upon it.
Afterward, recite the incantation to inscribe the talismans.

**Northern Emperor’s Incantation**—
*"The Supreme Spirit of Heavenly Azure*,
Within lies **armored brilliance**.
**Chaos and obscurity** in one breath—**east holds the concealed**.
The **Heavenly Emperor’s tread**,
**Mysterious traces** mark the **Heavenly Seal**.
Today’s talisman inscribing,
Serves as my **Heavenly Vessel**.
Swiftly, as the **Decree** commands!"*

**Brush-Invoking Incantation**—
*"[□] **covers the heavens**, swiftly shaking the **Ten thousand Spirits**.
**Dispatch the Command**—the **ghostly host flees its encampment**.
[□] **covers the True**, the **True Qi** formed,
Swiftly, as the **Decree** commands!"*

**Talisman-Inscribing Incantation**—
*"The **Northern Emperor’s Spirit Treasures**, the **Heavenly Emperor’s saliva** [□].
**Om!** Calling forth the **Divine Tiger**, souls fall in disarray.
**Heaven’s Net** spreads bright—**sun, moon, star encampments**,
The **soul’s qi** takes form.
Swiftly, as the **Decree** commands!"*

**Masculine Left, Feminine Right.**"

**"Feminine Right**—
Rightward, the **Command Talisman** is used again, invoking the **First Invocation of the Brush** anew. The **Two Great Saints** appear in the colors of imperial robes, one with a beard, each commanding **twelve thousand divine generals**.

The **Divine Tiger**—this refers to the **Heavenly Sovereign of Souls**, the **Divine Tiger Great Saint**, who governs souls. Its **jade talisman** and **mysterious registers** are divided left and right, with **fifteen Divine Tiger Flying Talisman Soul-Summoning Envoys** under its command, all clad in **crimson robes and celestial headgear**, each bearing their own talisman to summon them.

The invocation: *"**[□] covers the heavens"**—**[□] covers** is the name of the **Divine Tiger**, and **heavenly harmony** is the taboo name of the **Northern Emperor**.

**Two Jade Talisman Official Talismans**
**Jade Official Pursuit-Soul Talisman of the Heavenly Marshal [何□]**
**Three Pure Ones Command the Divine Tiger Primordial Lord [幽字]**
**Jade Official Pursuit-Soul Talisman of the Heavenly Marshal [乔□]**
**Three Sovereigns Command the Jade Talisman Official to Break the [幽字]**
These **two talismans** govern the souls of **celestial constellations, princes, nobles, and commoners**, inscribing the talisman and summoning them to the altar, where they are ensnared.

If the intent to pursue a soul is sincere, one may freely invoke it, using the **Functionary Talisman** in conjunction.

**Agitate the Northern Dipper Secret**, drawing **Northern Arc Qi** to blow upon the talisman.
Next, burn the talisman, drawing **one breath of Qi** to blow into the altar, then **recite the secret formula**.

**Divine Tiger Soul-Pursuit Envoy Talisman**—**Post-Heaven Seal Edict**
In the front, inscribe **"Sacred Treasure Great Law: Divine Tiger Soul-Pursuit"**;
in the middle, inscribe the **talisman**;
in the back, inscribe the **Heavenly Seal**.
Then, append the **year, month, day, and place** of the **Great Year**, followed by the **name of the summoning master** and their **seal of authority**.

This is the **Divine Tiger’s two-envoys’ talisman-edict**, written in **crimson on yellow-lined green seals**.
If the envoy talisman fails to summon the wandering soul, it is often due to **Yin Court litigation or grave offenses**, where the **Yin Officials** detain them in the **Mysterious Bureau**. There exists the **Primordial Descent Talisman-Edict** to summon them again—none shall refuse.

Also written in **crimson on yellow-lined green seals**.

**Three Envoys’ Talismans**
Use **green, yellow, and red silk**, each three *chi* long, split into two sections.
The upper section is painted with the **envoy’s likeness**, with **bent legs, celestial headgear**, dressed in their native robes, **jade belt**, **fish-tailed sword**, **green-leather boots**, and holding the talisman.
The lower section is inscribed in **crimson** with the **envoy’s true form talisman**, filling it completely.
Then, with the **summoning talisman and jade tablet**, burn them in **flaming fire**.
Once the talisman is complete, inscribe the **envoy’s name and taboo** at its center and **recite the Divine Tiger Incantation** in a circle around it.

**Another Method**
For **yang-day talismans**, inscribe **[何□] [乔□] [魏□]**.
For **yin-day talismans**, inscribe **[侯鬼] [由] [刘□] [张信]**.

**Upper Envoys’ Talisman**
**Middle Envoys’ Talisman**."

**Lower Envoys’ Talisman**
Inscribe the **General Summons Talisman**, the **Summons Talisman**, and the **Incantation**:
*"Divine Tiger Spear flies and runs, summoning and unifying all directions under one command."*
Recite **three times seven**, swiftly and urgently.
After the talisman, write the **proclamation text**:
*"Year [ ] Month [ ] Day [ ] from [location], hereby announced to all."*

**Right Envoys** pursue and retrieve the spirits of heavy *yin*-afflicted diseases and deceased souls from the **Ten Directions, Three Realms, Nine Regions, and Nine Earths**, all tormented souls in prisons, and all wandering, stagnant ghosts.

**Seven Paths of the True Form Talisman of the Celestial Maiden of the Mysterious Office**
**The Seven Primordial True Lords of the Divine Scripture** summon the **Celestial Maiden of the Mysterious Office**, who governs the souls of mortals—whether their deaths were natural or unnatural—and **conjures the departed souls**. Regardless of the year, month, day, or cause of death, this **Celestial Maiden’s True Form Talisman** shall know all.

**First Talisman: The Celestial Maiden of the Mysterious Office for Retrieving Souls and Capturing Spirits to Reverse Death**
The above three talismans are dispersed from the **Three Platforms**, summoning the **North Dipper’s Seven Primordial Forms**. Subsequent talismans follow the same method.

**True *Yuan* and Rectified *Qi* Illuminating the Netherworld**
(The characters *Xuanqi* in the above, likewise in subsequent talismans, follow this rule.)

**Second Talisman: The Celestial Maiden Governing the Souls of Those Who Died from Illness**
**Third Talisman: The Celestial Maiden Governing Souls of Plague, Pestilence, and Epidemic Diseases**
**Fourth Talisman: The Celestial Maiden Governing Souls of Exhaustion, Consumption, Wind Disorders, Epilepsy, Madness, and Leprosy**
**Fifth Talisman: The Celestial Maiden Governing Souls of Death by Fire, Water, Weapons, Drowning, Falling into Wells, Suicide, Unnatural Deaths, and Capital Punishment**
**Sixth Talisman: The Celestial Maiden Governing Souls of Miscarriage, Childbirth Deaths, Injuries, Blood Loss, and Bloodlight**
**Seventh Talisman: The Celestial Maiden Governing Souls of Obscure, Unclear Deaths, Lightning Strike, Wrongful Ghosts, and Deceitful Spirits**

For the above seven talismans, examine the deceased’s illness during their lifetime and determine which **Celestial Maiden** governs it. Issue only that corresponding talisman to summon them, following the method of the **Summoning Functionary Talisman** below. Seal with **Divine Sovereign’s Edict**.

**Retrieve the *Tianmen* Blowing Talisman.**
**Seven Divine Celestial Maidens’ Soul-Summoning Talisman**
Use **plain green paper**, each talisman **2.4 inches long**, inscribed with **cinnabar**.

Seven days before the altar is erected, the **High Master** shall ingest these talismans daily—seven paths each day, beginning with the first and completing them by the seventh day. Each morning, before the **Three Treasures**, face east and ingest them. Each day, inscribe one talisman, burn it to ash, and mix with a small amount of **poria** and **cinnabar**, boiling into a decoction for ingestion. The summoning shall take effect immediately.

When ingesting the talisman, maintain **uninterrupted practice**. Three to five days prior, issue the written proclamation to the relevant authorities, reporting to the **City Deity and Divine Tiger**. On the appointed day, prepare a **pure chamber**, free from all impurities. Burn incense, **summon water**, and purify the space before erecting the **Divine Tiger Altar**.

Though the **Seven Celestial Maidens** govern stagnant souls, another **Superintendent** oversees their commands. The **Two Divine Tigers** collect and record souls, granting reincarnation to the living—each fulfilling their duties.

**First Celestial Maiden (Chang Rengui):** Retrieves souls and reverses death.
**Second Celestial Maiden (Li Hua):** Governs souls of plague, pestilence, and those struck by epidemic *qi* while traveling.
**Third Celestial Maiden (You Feng):** Governs souls of death by weapons, suicide, exhaustion, demonic possession, and abduction.
**Fourth Celestial Maiden (Zhao Shen):** Governs souls of death by capital punishment, warfare, violence, poison, and unnatural causes.
**Fifth Celestial Maiden (Wei Bian):** Governs souls of drowning, hexes, cold exposure, and death from a hundred ailments.
**Sixth Celestial Maiden (Zhang Xin):** Governs souls of death by fire, scalding, windstroke, epilepsy, paralysis, carbuncles, and dysentery.
**Seventh Celestial Maiden (Xu Ming):** Governs souls of death by famine, wild beasts, insects, snakes, and all wrongful or violent deaths.

**Divine Tiger Summoning Functionary Talisman**
The **Divine Tiger Mysterious Office Altar** has **seven paths of Functionaries**, each with **120 officers**. When summoning, use talismans to invoke them.

When inscribing talismans, use **yellow paper with cinnabar script**, the **Jade Emperor’s Edict**, and **blow seven breaths of *qi* from the southeast** onto the brush’s tip while facing east. Burn alongside a **Jade Tablet**—they shall descend immediately before you.

The **Seven Celestial Maidens’ Talismans** follow the same edict and incantation. To summon a Functionary, recite:
*"I now summon [Functionary’s Name], swiftly descending to the altar as per the Sovereign’s decree."*

If **Heavenly or Divine Path Functionaries** are summoned, they shall dissolve the altar. Offer **wine, fruit, gold, and paper horses** before dismissing them to the **Celestial Treasury**.

Facing east and reciting the incantation, solemnly invoke the **Heavenly Path Functionary**, the **Earthly Path Functionary**, the **Human Path Functionary**, the **Daoist Path Functionary**, the **Divine Path Functionary**, the **Ghostly Path Functionary**, and the **Karmic Path Functionary**, and they shall descend as **true qi**.

**God-Tiger Summoning and Seizing Chapter**

**God-Tiger Summoning the Eight Gates Altar**
Summon the spirit, open the Ghost Gate, and let the **Eight Gates** enter—then close it. As the spirit arrives, open the Eight Gates to absolve sins, and issue the **Wheel-Returning Life-Granting Talisman**, each using a *position plaque*. Write the talisman’s face with the name of the **Dao** and its gate, and the back with the words **"Open Gate"**:

**Human Dao** – *Release Dao* – **"Rest Gate"** Talisman

Write the **Three Spirits** talisman at the banner’s apex.
**Seven Ghosts** talisman—
The Seven **Passions** open the **Karmic Gate** of the *Kesheng* cause; the **Evil Gate** is sealed. Ascend to the **Vermilion Palace**, all becoming the **Seven Virtues**.

If the talisman is for a woman, reverse the positions to the right.
**Supreme One’s Unified Summoning Talisman**—Banner-style.
**Dispersed Form Talisman**

God-Tiger Lady’s internal taboo name:
**Apex Talisman**

*Iron-Trace* **Radiance Platform** *Precious Scripture*—
Right scripture: with **yellow silk** three inches wide, write in **cinnabar** (vermilion). Use **Poria** (*Fuling*), **Poria-Tea** (*Fushen*), **Heavenly Winter-Hemp** (*Tianmen Dong*), **Ginseng** (*Renshen*), **Rehmannia** (*Dihuang*), each one portion, to decoct into a broth. Place within the **Eight Gates Summoning Altar**.

Raise the **Summoning Banner** to recognize the summoned spirit.
After the summoning, sprinkle the altar in all directions with a **willow branch**, so that the **hidden** may take form and the **manifest** may recognize their shadow and appear.

Some say: use **green silk** seven inches four portions wide, writing in **cinnabar**.

**Eight Gates Altar Banner Talisman**
*Iron-Trace* **Radiance Platform** character.

**Radiance Platform Talisman Characters**
Right: Two banners—write with **orpiment** and **cinnabar** in mixture.
Set them together with the departed’s banner within the Eight Gates Altar.

If summoning a **yang** soul, use the **Iron-Trace Banner** to call them.
If summoning a **yin** soul, use the **Radiance Platform Banner** to call them.
Both must be accompanied by the **Jade Emperor’s Secret Formula**.

**Yang-Yang Passage Altar**
*Overseer of the Underworld Official Liu [ ]*
Oversees the departed ancestors, the myriad generations of ancestors—
those who have passed far or near, all souls and spirits.

**Yin-Soul Soul-Capturing Altar**
*Overseer of the Underworld Official Ming [ ]*
Oversees those who died of illness, untimely death, self-inflicted harm, or violence,
those imprisoned, bound, or long lost in the netherworld—
all souls and spirits.

Right: These two altars must each use **two fresh, purified stones**,
laid upon the ground in a square of six *chi* (or three *chi* six *cun*).
Sift them finely to make them even and level them perfectly.

**Left Hand: Heavenly Sovereign Seal**
Pinch with the index and middle fingers at the base of the thumb,
then pinch the middle finger’s center with the thumb.
The remaining two fingers spread wide, curved backward—
like the **Fighter’s Dipper** pointing forward.
Within the Dipper lie the **Two Celestial Emperors**.

With this seal, invoke the **Thunder Servants**, command the **Lightning**, halt the rain, summon the **Dragon**, restrain the wrath of thunder and lightning, tame the ferocity of tigers and leopards, and subdue spirits while capturing ghosts—all through this seal.

**Right Hand: Jade Purity Formula**
Write with the middle finger as per the original.

Center the **Overseer of the Underworld Official’s position** and inscribe the altar’s name.
Place the **Sacred Tiger’s Seat** before the altar.
Below the altar, set a small incense burner, pure wine, and the **Summoning Child’s Talisman** along with the **Sacred Tiger’s Commands**.

When the summoning is complete, use the **Summoning Soul Talisman**, **Manifest Form Talisman**, **Passage Manifest Talisman**, **Passage to the Obscure Talisman**, and **Passage to Speech Talisman**.
Draw water from the **west-flowing stream**, sprinkle it, and all departed souls will immediately reveal their true forms.
They will converse with the living as in life—
words heard clearly.
If the living weep in sorrow, the souls will depart.
If the living rejoice, the souls will fully manifest their essence,
indistinguishable from the living—
visible to all, coming and going like a marketplace.

Treat them with reverence.
Those summoned and dispatched will respond instantly,
like echoes answering calls,
with effects manifesting in moments.

**Especially forbid anger or summoning with private intent.**
No other prohibitions apply.

Place **male and female seals** upon the altar.

**Transformation:**
Left hand invokes the **Tiger**, right hand uses the **Upper Purity Formula**.

The middle phalanx of the right hand, eyes closed, visualizes oneself as the **Saviour of Suffering True Person**—
clad in a **Green Mist Feathered Garment**, wearing a **Pure Crown**, jingling with **Red Beads and Jewelled Sandals**,
distinct in form—
then treads the **Nine Phoenix Steps to Break Defilement**.

With each step, silently recite one character.
Upon completion, chant the **Incantation**:

*"Tianpeng Tianpeng, brandish sword against malevolence.
Serve the Northern Emperor, possessing great **dharma-powers**.
Supreme Sage and High True One, purify my heart.
No foul **qi** shall arise—
**Dao/Way** of gods and immortals.
Drive mountains, block seas—
day and night without pause.
Six Jia and Six Ding, press souls to manifest.
Swiftly, as the **Female Azure Law** commands."*

After chanting, inhale **qi** from above and exhale nine breaths forward.
Then, left hand opens the **Heavenly Sovereign Seal**—
draw the **Yang Radiance Seal** to pierce the **Passageway of the Nine Gates** with the **Incantation**:

*"By the Five Elements created, return to the Five Elements.
The Four Great Ones combined in vain, revert to the Great Void.
Yin or Yang, follow the roots of Heaven and Earth.
When Heaven and Earth are dark, ten thousand ghosts retreat.
When Heaven and Earth move, ten thousand ghosts awaken—
Yin and Yang transform, gods and spirits rejoice.
Sensed, they wander to my banner,
Granting you the **Sacred Scripture**, returning to the **Upper Purity Dao**.
Swiftly, as the **Upper Purity Mysterious Sovereign Great One God-Tiger Law** commands."*

Upon completion, face the **Ghostly Gate**, inhale **qi** nine times, and exhale it toward them.
Recite the **Incantation of the Seal**.

Next, draw the **Yin Spirit Seal to Capture the Soul** with the **Incantation**:

*"Yin and Yang push and turn—
calamity shifts, fate alters.
Life and death cycle endlessly—
who is wise, who is foolish?
Revolving without limit,
the **Upper Purity Dao** shapes creation.
Unreleased from the Three Realms,
bound by **dharma-transformation**.
The **Ghostly Chief** scoops from the **Eastern Dipper**—
the **Ghostly Father** turns westward.
The **Ghostly Mother** heads south—
the **Ghostly Procession** faces north.
The **Yin Spirit** drifts, vast and formless,
the **Yang Soul** wanders, restless and boundless.
When Heaven and Earth are dark, ten thousand ghosts retreat.
When Heaven and Earth move, ten thousand ghosts awaken—
Yin and Yang transform, ghosts and spirits rejoice.
Sensed, they wander to my altar,
Granting you the **Sacred Scripture**, returning to the **Upper Purity Dao**.
Swiftly, as the **Upper Purity Mysterious Sovereign Great One God-Tiger Law** commands."*

Upon completion, face the **Ghostly Gate**, inhale **qi** nine times, and exhale it toward them.
Recite the **Incantation of the Seal**.

Then, brandish sword and face the altar, chanting the **Incantation**:

*"Yang Radiance returns the soul—
unaffected by the **Scriptures of Death**.
Yin Essence captures the **po**, restoring the corpse and crossing the calamity.
Reflect on the **Three Souls and Seven Po**—
the **Fetal Light** does not fade, the **Luminous Soul** camps.
The **Dark Essence** revives, the **Corpse-Dog** departs from evil.
The **Hidden Arrow** dispels malevolence, the **Sparrow-Yin** is untainted.
The **Swallowing Thief** opens the **Brightness**, no poison lingers.
Defilement is removed—
the **Stinking Lung** sealed, the **Yang Soul** restored.
Heaven and Earth align their **True Qi**,
reuniting your form and spirit.
This is the **Five Elements**, the **True Essence** of creation.
The **Five Viscera and Ten Thousand Gods**, eternally preserving well-being.
Yang Soul and Yin Po—
no escape from your form.
One breath, one inhalation—
quickly transform.
The **Sacred Seal** captures, the altar reveals the **Soul-Light**.
Swiftly, as the **Supreme Law of the Sacred Treasure Great Dao** commands."*

The **God-Tiger Seal to Summon Souls**—
**Incantation of the Seal**:

*"The Heavenly Dao is vast—
ten thousand spirits transform.
Where Heaven and Earth reach,
execute swiftly as commanded.
□□ aligns with Heaven—
ten thousand spirits tremble in response.
The Seal descends—
ghosts awaken and scatter.
Write with **black ink on white paper**, using the **Heavenly Sovereign Seal** and the **Jade Purity Incantation**,
blow and sprinkle into the **Soul-Capturing Altar**."*

The **God-Tiger Seal to Manifest Form** (also called the **Seal of Seclusion**)
uses the same **Incantation** as before,
written in **red on yellow paper**,
submerged in the **north-flowing stream**.
The **Master of the Law** takes one **Seal** for self-ingestion,
while those who have departed within three years
may burn the **Seal** to ashes,
hold it in their hands,
and chant the **Incantation**, invoking the **soul of a certain household**,
declaring it to be blown toward the **northeast**.

The **Seal to Send the Messenger of Manifestation**—
burn to ashes, mix with water, and sprinkle inside and outside the altar.
The **Incantation** reads:

*"Swiftly, the **God-Tiger** captures,
□□ seals—two **Seals** merge with your form.
Swiftly, as the **Law** commands."*

The **Seal to Release the Dark and Transform the Calamity**—
**Incantation**:

*"The Heavenly Dao is vast—
ten thousand spirits transform.
The Emperor’s command,
execute swiftly as ordered."*

The **Seal of the Universal Manifestation of the Tongue**—
burn to ashes,
sprinkle upon the living,
to reveal departed souls and enable communication.
The **Incantation** reads:

*"The Supreme Emperor commands—
**God-Tiger** and **Divine Generals**.
The departed soul obeys,
swiftly crossing to convey speech.
Swiftly, as the **Law** commands."*

The **Seal of the Universal Manifestation of the Eyes**—
**Incantation**:

*"The Supreme One descends with mercy,
to save mortals in the world.
Isolated Yin and Yang—
ears and eyes radiant with **Sacred Light**.
Swiftly come, reveal your form,
swiftly listen, speak your words.
Respectfully invite the **Soul-Light Child** to guard the **dharma**,
clearly manifesting the response.
The **God-Tiger Seal of Full Form** is written beneath the **Seal of Seclusion**—
**Incantation of the Seal**:

*"Jade Purity, Supreme Sage,
overseeing the Mysterious Darkness.
The **God-Tiger** receives the command,
executes swiftly as ordered.
Yeni pervades all,
North Idle traverses freely.
The **Water Barrier** of the **Dark Yin**,
reaches as far as the **Ping Court**.
Where the **Soul-Register** is held,
open the gates and unlock the barriers.
Heavenly Gods respectfully bow,
Earthly Spirits prostrate in reverence.
Pursue and capture the **Dark Realm**,
restrain the **Wronged Ghosts** to resolve their plight.
The Northern Emperor has decreed—
ten thousand spirits sense and obey.
Swiftly, as the **Supreme Emperor’s Command**."*

The **Manifestation Incantation**:
*"Om, command,宣尼,咤嚄唵哆哆哩吃。"*
Seal it within the **Soul-Register**,
recite the **Incantation** and command it.
Burn one **Seal** before the **incense burner** of the departed,
to manifest their form.

The **Two Seals of the Jade Treasury Monitoring Child**:
The **Sacred Treasure Jade Treasury** inherently possesses
**Soul-Monitoring Child** and **Soul-Guiding Child**,
each numbering one hundred and twenty.
The **Soul-Monitoring Child** oversees the departed,
preventing them from wandering east or west.
The **Soul-Guiding Child** leads the departed to come and go,
to take their seats and manifest.
They also manage **bathing and receiving precepts**,
**water and fire refining and liberation**,
**receiving merit and ascending the **Bridge of Immortals****,
all under their purview.
Write the **Seal** with **qi** from the **Northern Chief**,
blowing the brush three times.
**Soul-Monitoring Child Seal of True Form**
**Soul-Guiding Child Seal of True Form**
**God-Tiger Seal of Distant Trust**
**Sacred Seal**."

「To the right, first write the name, age, month, day, and hour of the deceased, followed by the names of thieves, corpses, and stolen goods. Then, use two pieces of plain white silk, each two *chi* in length, to inscribe the second set of seals. Roll them within the **God-Tiger Pass (神虎关)**, and together with the **Five Dao Decrees and Seals (五道牒符)**, burn them as one.

**Five Dao Decrees and Seals (五道牒符):**
The **God-Tiger Pass Seal (神虎关前符)** and the **Luminous Dao Ritual Seal (行持)**—
Once the **Jade Decree (玉札)** is issued, immediately don the **Northern Dipper God-Tiger Jade Decree (北斗神虎玉札)**, displaying the **Responsive Spirit Seal (显应灵符)**. Establish the **Illuminating Yang Altar (建阳耀坛)**, and invoke the **Tiger Marshal of the Northern Chief (刘□□)**. Spitting a mouthful of water, first swallow the **Seal of the Obscure and Silent (幽寂符)**, then inscribe the **Seal of Covering the Soul and Communicating with Ghosts (覆魂通鬼符)**. Have the living person carry it into the prison; they will then converse with their ancestors.

Establish the **Illuminating Obscure Altar (建阴灵坛)**, and summon the **Luminous Marshal (明□□)**, who oversees the summoning of souls who died from illness, sudden misfortune, self-inflicted wounds, or were wrongfully imprisoned for long periods in the **Netherworld Officialdom (冥司)**. All matters concerning the **Souls and their Dao Feasts (魂魄法筵)** are completed.

At the moment of use, holding a sword and facing **southwest**, take water and recite the incantation:
*"O, God-Tiger Prison Official and Luminous Marshal (神虎狱神明□□)! I command you to carry out the **God-Tiger Decree (神虎之令)**. Summon all idle souls and wild ghosts, forbidding them to linger. Swiftly proceed to the prison and reveal their traces and forms. **As it is decreed by the Dao.**"*

Then, blow **Southeast Dao qi (东南炁)** into the water, spray it **southwestward**, retrieve the **Southwest Dao qi (西南炁)** and blow it into the prison. Also inscribe a seal for the person to swallow; shortly, they will see all the souls entering the prison.

**God-Tiger Jade Decree Responsive Spirit Seal (神虎玉札显应符)**—written in red and swallowed.

Incantation for swallowing the seal:
*"I summon and constrain the wandering souls to return swiftly. **As it is decreed by the Dao.**"*

**Seal of Covering the Soul and Communicating with Ghosts (覆魂通鬼符)**—
Incantation for the seal:
*"By the **Taiwei Decree (太微令)**, I command the ghosts to fall and disperse from their dwellings. **As it is decreed by the Dao.**"*

This seal is written in red, to be carried by oneself or others into the prison. All lonely souls will be made to communicate and reveal the circumstances of their deaths.

If the souls enter the wilderness or appear in groups around graves, and speak with the living, their names can be known. The method states: When establishing the **Obscure Prison (阴狱)**, swallow the aforementioned seal. While swallowing, recite the incantation again:
*"O, Three Officials (三官) and Northern Chief (北酆), reaching the **Most Pure Dao (上清)**! O, Netherworld Officials (天狱主吏)! I command you to receive and lead the **Soul-essence (魂爽)**, not allowing any transgression or offense. **As it is decreed by the Dao.**"*

Once the prison is established, holding a sword and facing **east**, recite the incantation five times, blowing **qi** into the water and spraying it into the prison. The **Left Male Jade Official (雄左玉曹主伯)** and the **Right Female Martial Official (雌右武鸾主吏)**—I now summon the soul of **[specific name] (某魂)**, swiftly arriving at my prison, without delay. **O, He Chang Qiao Xun (何昌乔荀)!** Assist my **Body-Soul (身神)**. I command my decrees to be carried out swiftly. **As it is decreed by the Dao.**"*

After spitting water into the prison, the summoned souls and lonely spirits—regardless of their number—will appear. The two seals, along with the **Celestial Sovereign Seal (天皇印)**, the **Jade Purity Decree (玉清诀)**, and the **Xun Dao qi (巽炁)**, are used. The master first swallows one seal, then blows the **Northern Flowing Water qi (北流水中)** into the water, sprays the **altar (坛中)**, and onto the four walls inside the chamber. All the deceased will see them, which is called **"Releasing the Obscure and Dissolving Illusions (通幽释变)"**.

**Living Character Seal (生字符)**—
Place the **God-Tiger Altar ashes (神虎坛灰)** beneath the **Iron Trace (铁迹)** to summon the soul. Write the **Yang Dao qi (寅文艮炁)**.

Incantation:
*"Dark and distant, ascending to the ninth heaven (九霄)! Descending to the divided realms (分野), swiftly summoning ghosts and spirits (鬼神速招). By the **Primordial Beginning Decree (元始符命)**, I pursue and elevate your souls. You shall not scatter; disobedient ones will perish like ice in melting waters. **Swiftly, by the Dao’s decree, summon the ghostly generals (急急追魂神将)! Swiftly, pursue and bring forth the soul of [specific name] (某魂) to the **Primordial Head (元头)**!"*

**Seal of Summoning All Ghostly Souls (都召鬼魂符)**—
Incantation:

「幽幽冥冥，天地清宁。
The profound and obscure—heaven and earth in serene stillness.

三皇助我，六丁卫我。
The Three Sovereigns aid me; the Six Ding Guardians defend me.

吾是太上之孙，真人之子，烦呼诸神，急急应灵。

**Imperial Edict of the Supreme Sovereign of Taiwei, the Divine Tiger and Dragon Chapter:**

上清北都，太玄之境。
In the Upper Clarity’s Northern Capital, within the Great Mysterious Realm.

紫英夫人，函以杳灵。
The Purple Flower Lady contains the hidden spirits.

冀以禁臻，降范北魁。
I hope to restrain the distant and bring order to the Northern Hosts.

数足有机，无神敢忘。
With numbers complete and mechanisms in place, no god dares forget.

神虎之律，急急流祥。
By the Divine Tiger’s law, swift blessings flow.

七元之真，统摄雷翔。

翼力不彰，显迹云刚。

召诀
**Summoning Talisman:**

男中指第一节，女第二节，孤魂五指根。
For men, use the first joint of the middle finger; for women, the second; for solitary souls, the root of the little finger.

次召
**Subsequent Summoning:**

天一天将，统兵一千员，速至坛所。
Heaven’s Heavenly General, commanding a thousand soldiers, swiftly arrive at the altar.»

「Swiftly, as the Green Dragon’s imperial edicts and decrees. I gather the **Supreme Sovereign’s Divine Talisman** (太上神符), binding all your spirits.

Invoke by name and they shall stand before you; behold their forms and they shall rejoice. The Green Dragon stands to the left, the White Tiger to the right, the Heavenly Demon (天魔) in the abdomen. My head wears the **Heavenly Trident** (天罡), my feet tread the **Dark Tortoise** (玄武), and all spirits flee in haste. Let this talisman summon the ghosts—none shall dare not come.

Swiftly, as the decree.

**Heavenly Sovereign’s Talisman** (天皇诀) thrice, with **Kan Qi** (艮炁) and the **Banner** (旛) raised above. For men, use the left thumb’s nail from the **Yang of the Tiger** (寅) to the **Yi of the Dragon** (巳), then the second finger’s nail and the thumb’s base to the root, reversing with the thumb’s nail and the **Great Killing Mark** (大煞文)—also called the **Heavenly Pong’s Marshal Talisman** (亦名天蓬元帅诀). When grasping the **Mountain Talisman** (山诀), chant upward if raised, downward if lowered. The **Mountain Seal** (山字) is formed by the left little finger entering the middle finger, bending the second and fourth fingers, and hooking the little finger’s nail.

The **Supreme Sovereign’s Talisman** (上帝诀) is straight with the middle finger. The **Trident Method** (罡法): walk forward with both feet in the **Kan Qi** (艮) stance until the tenth step, then raise the left hand with the **Heavenly Sovereign’s Seal** (天皇印) and the right hand with the **Supreme Sovereign’s Talisman** (上清诀). Invoke the **Divine Tiger Great Saint** (神虎大圣), the **Divine Tiger General** (神虎将军), the **Heavenly One, Northern Ancestor Princess** (天一北祚元君), the **Supreme One, Reborn Soul True Lord** (太一复魂真君), the **Xiaofu, Assistant Spirit Great God** (霄辅助精大神), and all together—then both hands join in **Five Sovereigns’ Total Talisman** (五帝总诀), raising without trembling the body.

The **Soul-Binding Spirit Marshal** (摄魂神将), General Liu□□, the **Soul-Binding Marshal with the Kan Seal** (搯寅叉腰追魂神将), General He Chang; the **Reborn Soul Marshal** (返魂神将), General Qiao□; the **Soul-Gathering Official** (聚魂功曹), Zhang Wenying; the **Soul-Binding Jade Maiden** (摄魂玉女), fifteen in number; the **Soul-Confronting Marshal** (对魂神将), General Liu Guangting; the **Soul-Ordering Marshal** (整魂神将), the **Supreme One Lord** (太一君).

**Om!** The incantation **Duduyu Yoyu** (唵咄咄曳呦呦), with the **Qi** (炁) rhythm gathered in **Kan** (艮) and the **Banner** (旛) raised above. The left hand forms the **Mountain Seal** (山字) while the middle finger traces the **Great Killing Mark** (大煞文); for each incantation, take the **Qi** (炁) from the east-north direction.

Peck the **Auspicious Plate** (吉盘陀伽利摄), binding the **Qi** (炁). Blow the **Qi** (炁) upward to the **Banner** (旛), slightly tilting the body as if falling.

The **Soul-Seeking, Spirit-Binding Incantation** (寻魂摄魄咒) says:

*"I solemnly request the Spirit Marshal, Horse General (马将军), to first go to the City God (城隍) and the Five Ways (五道), then to the Water Realm (水府) and the mortal world. To the Five Mountains (五岳) and the **Tangdu** (酆都) Abyss, all the Underworld Realms (地府), to seek and retrieve the lost soul of the departed [name], bringing it to the Daoist ritual site (道场)."*

The **Supreme Sovereign’s Talisman** (上帝诀) with **Northern Qi** (北炁).

The **Soul-Pursuing Incantation** (追魂咒) says:

*"I now perform the binding and summoning; I request Horse Anren (马安仁). First, go to the City God (城隍) to inquire; next, to the Mountain Abyss (岳府) to seek. Mount Tai is vast and unseen, the Underworld endures suffering. The **Soul-Ordering Incantation** (整魂咒) says:

*"Open the jade gates of the **Lingdu** (灵都), halt the interrogations of **Tangdu** (酆都). Remove the sins of the Three Realms (三涂), I now summon your soul. No restriction in all places—**Tangdu’s** punishments are deep. The Sovereign Lord now decrees: swiftly bring forth your body. Go to the **Zhuling Palace** (朱陵府), stand at the **Gate of Life** (生天门). Receive my pure and cleansing incantation—all officials release the soul in haste. All officials swiftly judge the soul."*

If only half the body is seen, grasp with both hands the **Kan Seal** (艮文), raise them, and shout for the full form to appear. The **Spirit-Binding Incantation** (摄见咒) says:

*"I respectfully request the **Zimwei, Great Luo Celestial Worthy** (紫微大罗天尊) of the East-North direction, the **Dark Primordial Lawmaster** (玄中大法师), and the **Left Dark True Person** (左玄真人). Open my disciple’s petition, shake the golden essence, and lift the jade gates. Bind and reveal the Heavenly and Earthly spirits—let the lost soul of [name] swiftly come and manifest its form. Swiftly, as the decree of the **Zimwei, Great Luo Celestial Worthy** (紫微大罗天尊)."*

Another incantation says:
*"The **Tangdu Officials** bind the soul, gather the spirit."*

Another incantation says:
*"Black Sovereign, Black Emperor (黑君黑帝), swiftly divide the ghostly **Qi** (炁) into form."*

Another incantation says:
*"The **Southern Dipper, Heavenly Trident God** (南斗天罡神), resplendent and obedient. The **Jade Maiden of the Dipper’s Mouth** (斗口玉女神), manifests at the **Gate of Life** (生天)."*

Those who arrive at my altar shall be surrounded by ten million soldiers. The method says: *"If binding or summoning is delayed, write the **Divine Tiger’s Release and Transformation, Soul-Retrieval Talisman** (神虎释变收魂符) and the **Responsive and Catalyzing Soul-Retrieval, Spirit-Manifestation Talisman** (感应催魂见形灵符), and burn them."*

**Soul-Retrieval Talisman** (收魂符), the **Decree Talisman Incantation** (勑符咒) says:
*"Heaven moves, Earth transforms, the lost soul returns, swiftly and urgently. Swiftly, as the decree."*

This talisman is inscribed in **cinnabar script** (朱书), taking **Northern Qi** (北炁) into the talisman. When this talisman is posted on a person’s household doors, their name shall be called incessantly at night—three months without end—and those called shall die. This is the **Supreme Sovereign’s** (上帝) decree to punish the wicked; the master must not use it with private intentions.

The method says: *"If the departed died within three years of death, write the talisman and burn it into ash, then strike the person’s home with it. Invoke the lost soul of [name], blowing **Kan Qi** (艮方). Next, use the earlier talisman’s ash mixed with water, and spray it on the wall—it shall appear immediately."*

For those who die suddenly and whose corpse remains unburied for three days or less, hang the **Banner** (旛) over the corpse and use a **white silk strip** (白缯) seven inches long to write the talisman in **cinnabar script** (朱书). Burn it in the center of the corpse, then as before, notify the **Jade Tablet Officials** (玉札) and the **Soul Gods** (魂神) to return and restore the original corpse—life shall be regained.

For all methods of retrieving living souls (摄生魂), the corpse’s tibia must remain intact, and the soul must not have passed through three **Qi** (炁) cycles—otherwise, it cannot be pursued. When performing this method, use the **Generals Guan and He** (关何二将) and carry the **Jade Tablet** (玉札) as instructed.

**Divine Tiger’s Soul-Binding Talisman** (神虎摄魂符). When writing this talisman, first face **Xun Qi** (巽), invoke the brush, take the **Qi**, and blow it—then inscribe in **cinnabar script** (朱书). The incantation says:

*"Heaven, Earth, and the Three Officials (三官) of the North **Tangdu** (北酆) examine the ghostly camps. No hiding shall be allowed—the **Golden Horse Inn** (金马驿) presents them. Universal proclamation, all spirits heed. The Three Realms (三界) and Five Sovereigns (五帝) align their words to the **Supreme Sovereign’s** (上清). Swiftly, as the **Primordial Beginning Celestial Worthy’s** (元始天尊) decree."*

This talisman is to be hung and burned beneath the nose—it shall swiftly return.

For all **Jade Tablet Officials** (玉札) dispatches, the incantation says:
*"Generals Guan and He (何乔二神), bearing this **Jade Tablet** (玉札), swiftly pursue the living soul. Swiftly, as the decree."*

Burn the **Jade Tablet Officials’ Dispatch** (玉札关子) along with the talisman—it shall swiftly return. If a coffin is seen, follow the method: face **Xun Qi** (巽) and invoke the incantation thrice—the person within the coffin shall make a sound.

The **Divine Tiger’s Talisman** (神虎诀). The **Chen Seal** (辰文).

**"Summoning and Dispatching Talisman**
*Summoning the Divine Tiger General*
The **Divine Tiger Warrior** (神虎力士), overseeing the **Heavenly Soldiers** (天丁), summons the wandering soul and universally attends the **Law Assembly** (法会).
With talisman in hand, face north and recite the incantation three times. Use **three gold coins and three horse figurines**, burning them beneath the talisman’s foot to invoke the **Divine Tiger’s Urgent Dispatch** (神虎催关).

Next, pass the talisman to a **novice**. The master silently intones:
*"Jin Zha Quan Zha* (金咤全咤), the **Jade Emperor’s** (玉帝) decree is swift to summon.
*Jin Zha Quan Zha*, *Duo Zha* (咄咤), the **Jade Emperor’s** decree is swift to summon.
*Om Jin Jing* (唵金晶), *Om Jin Jing*.
*Jin Jing Duo Zha* (金晶咄咤), the **Jade Emperor’s** decree is swift to summon."

To the right: the **Fighting Talisman Method** (斗诀), inscribed with the **Chen Seal** (辰文). Invoke the **Gang Qi** (罡炁) three times, three times drawing the qi, pacing the **Southern Dipper** (南斗), and standing south—it shall appear instantly.
A golden radiance shines upon the soul; nobles and commoners follow my talisman’s command.
The **Northern Dipper’s** (北斗) **Tianpeng’s** (天蓬) decree, **Xuanwu** (玄武) opens the **Gloomy Pass** (幽关).
*Mu Duo Ye Du* (目哆野堵).
Swiftly, as the decree.

This method: with the left hand invoking the **Supreme Sovereign’s Talisman** (上帝诀), recite the incantation once, then summon with a gesture. Cast the talisman three times.
The incantation:
*"Bao Lun Jin Jin Ru Lü Ling*" (宝轮急急如律令).
Recite seven times, blowing seven times upon the talisman, ordering the novice to hold it fast. Invoke the **Mao Calendar Talisman** (卯历子诀) to strike.

Another method:
*"Tai Mountain’s Swiftness* (泰山疾速), the **Divine Temple descends** (神庙降临), **Tianpeng presses urgently** (天蓬急压).
Swiftly.
The talisman’s mouth receives the decree."

「Taking **qi** (气), stepping the **Southern Dipper** (南斗), the form appears when standing to the south.

The **Mountain Talisman** (山字诀):
Bathing in water, the **qi** moves—
Recite the incantation: *"Zhīchē Lěibàn Shè"* (智车篾蘗摄).
Swiftly, as the decree of the **Three Officials** (三官).

This method: the adept enters at **Mao** (卯) and exits at **Wei** (未), receiving the talisman with the mouth.
Guide to the seat where the form appears: recite *"Yǐdì □lǔ wūwū nùchā"* (抳帝□噜呜怒叉).
Urge the departed soul (催亡):
*Yuànshǐ Qīngqīng, Lǎnglǎng Línglíng* (元始清清, 朗朗灵灵).
The **Yuan Shi** (元始) pursues the soul with solemn **qi** (司追魂吏), swiftly summoning its true form (速摄见真形).
Swiftly, swiftly (疾疾).
One variant reads: *"Yuan Shi pursues the soul with divine tiger qi"* (本司神虎吏).

This method: grasp the root of the middle finger with the right hand, then pinch the middle finger backward at the palm's center.
Order the novice to close their eyes, reciting the incantation **21 times** (三七次).
Then command them to open their eyes and behold the form as it appears (看之现形了), and cease.
If the form does not appear, repeat the first three incantations again—it will surely appear.

**Yu Compliance Talisman** (郁仪符) for the **Fire Pool** (火池):
Circular form, square **qi** (圆形方景).
Recite the incantation: *"Óu Kǒu Fùlǐluō Hūng"* (唵口缚哩啰吽).
Preserve the **Purple Light** (紫光) of the **Nine Radiant Spearheads** (九芒), using the **Mao Nine Talisman** (左九本诀).

**Jié Lín Talisman** (结璘符) for the **Water Pool** (水池):
Square form, circular **qi** (方形圆象).
Recite the incantation: *"Óu Yǐnglǐluō Zhà"* (唵哩啰咤).
Preserve the **White Light** (白光) of the **Ten Radiant Spearheads** (十芒), using the **Wei Ten Talisman** (右十本诀).

**Bowl-shaped Talisman** (钵形谱) for protecting the **Fire Pool** (火车摄).
Refine and purify with these incantations—each talisman is turned **twice**, and this incantation is applied to it.

This talisman is written in **Yin** (寅) seven times; it may be burned within the **incense burner** (香炉) during the **Fire Pool** (火法) summoning (可於香炉内烧之, 炼度摄召旛下).
For the **Water Method** (水法) during purification, recite *"Zhīchē Lún Shè"* (智车轮摄).
Seven times, taking the **Northern Qi** (北炁).
For the **Fire Method** (火法), recite *"Huǒchē Lún Shè"* (火车轮摄).
Seven times, taking the **Southern Qi** (南炁).

**Ear-opening Transmission Incantation** (耳通传咒):
*"Wū Lún Tú Chā Jí Jiào Tā Shén Tōng Chuányǔ Huà"* (乌仑屠叉急教它神通传语话).
With both hands forming the **Cosmic Seal** (斗印), take the **Celestial Gate’s Qi** (天门炁) and blow it into both ears.

**Drop the Talisman** (坠旛):
This talisman is the **Yin Talisman** (玉诀) of **Gen Qi** (艮炁), [blank], burned within the incense burner to summon and refine below.

**Attached Talisman** (附符) method:
With the left hand invoking the **Chen Talisman** (辰诀), and the right hand forming the **Cosmic Seal** (斗印),
first order the novice to ingest **ice-cold water** (角冷水先令服之).
Turn the **Arcane Star** (魁罡) into the **Divine Holy Army** (神圣兵).
**Chen** (辰) and **Xu** (戌) turn the **Cosmic Seal** to the left—**Green Dragon** (青龙) is in **Jia** (甲) and **Yi** (乙).
**Mao** (卯) turns to the right—**White Tiger** (白虎) is in **Geng** (庚) and **Xin** (辛).
**Yi** (酉) precedes **Red Bird** (朱雀) in **Bing** (丙) and **Ding** (丁).
**Wu** (午) follows **Xuanwu** (玄武) in **Ren** (壬) and **Gui** (癸).
The **Zi** (子) sentence is placed above—**Chen Fu** (陈覆) is written.
**Chen** (辰) is coiled below—**She Pan** (蛇蟠) is invoked.
At **Si** (巳), I solemnly invoke the **Supreme Sovereign’s Decree** (奉上帝勑) to the **Six Celestial Generals** (六神),
urgently descending to pursue and refine the departed soul (某人真魂) of the deceased.
The **true spirit** (真魄) attaches to the novice’s body, connecting to the **Yang Compliance** (阳眷).
Swiftly, swiftly (疾疾).

「Right Ritual: First, secretly promise the novice a sum of money, then declare:
*"Supreme Sovereign’s divine grace—with me, swiftly enter the body and restore the soul!"*

Right hand inhales **qi** once, harmonizing the incantation and striking the novice’s forehead, visualizing the soul and spirit together entering from the novice’s body, passing through the **Mystic Gates** (眾妙門) into the Five Zang Organs (五臟) and Six Fu Organs (六腑), the Four Limbs (四肢) and Eight Vessels (八脈), and also from the deceased’s soul and spirit.

Among the three people, the one inside who trembles violently is kept, and the ritualist commands:
*"The spirit shall urgently hasten the departed—attaching to the novice’s body, tremble swiftly and violently!"*

With the incantation, gently stroke the novice’s **Yi** (伊) position below the heart, saying:
*"Clearly and swiftly transmit the message."*

After reciting, declare:
*"The departed shall urgently return to the **Yin Court** (陰府)."*

If the deceased has not yet awakened, chant the **Awakening Soul Incantation** (醒魂咒):
*"Three souls return, seven spirits rejoin.
Heaven and Earth grow dim—
the divine soul descends with urgency."*

Take **Gui qi** (亥炁), and blow it upon the novice’s face.

To summon the soul before its appearance in the **San Tu** (三涂, Three Realms of the Dead) and **Wu Ku** (五苦, Five Torments), recite:
**Hong Xing** (紅杏),
**Mo Hei** (墨黑),
**Mo Zhen** (磨真),
**Mie Lian** (篾臈),
**Ling Bao** (靈寶).

*"The task is accomplished—
**Qie Jiao Zhen** (切角鎮),
**Xing Sheng Zhuan** (興生轉),
**Du Li Qian** (獨隸遷),
**Ke Han Ming** (可韓明)."*

To gather the soul and complete the task, summon the **Eight Directions Swift Messengers** (八方捷疾使者), the **Heavenly Gods and Earthly Spirits** (天神地祇), and all **sentient beings** (萬靈) to return and unite under the **Bright Emperor of Heaven’s decree** (合明天帝日).

Reverently petition the **Eight Great Daoist Deities of the Bagua** (乾坎艮震巽離坤兑八卦大神):
*"Swiftly gather and restore the departed soul of [the deceased’s name], entrusting it to my paper mirror.
Urgent and swift, manifest its form!"*
**Swiftly, swiftly!** (疾疾)

Preserve the **Three Characters of Heaven, Earth, and Man** (天地人三字) upon the mirror.
With **Xun qi** (巽炁), blow upon the mirror and the person’s face, and repeat the summoning:

「Before the face [of the deceased],
Recite the **Sutra of Gathering the Soul and Manifesting the Three Realms of Suffering** (摄魂未现三涂五苦诀咒):
*"Hóngxìng* (紅杏) wings the lodging and spits,
*Mòhēi* (墨黑) is pierced by the Five Peaks Sutra,
Break it and preserve my left [hand].
*Mózhēn* (磨真) is folded and subdued,
*Lièdiān* (篾臈) is beaten at the relay station.
Break *Língbǎo* (灵宝),
Gather in my hands.
The errant soul is pursued and examined;
If it passes the relay station, it is judged as a ghost.
Swiftly, swiftly!

**Right Method of Hóngxìng** (紅杏法):
To drive away the ghostly evils within a person’s body,
When they refuse to reveal their true names upon interrogation,
Use this palm to burn the *hóngxìng* (紅杏) and the *lièdiān* (篾臈) water.

Again, [recite] **□□□□□□** (急急), swiftly manifesting their form!
The **True Qi of the Heavenly Gate** (天門真炁) descends,
Swiftly hastening to the altar.

Seven crossings lead to dispersal;
[Recite] **□□□□□□** (朝太一), all sentient beings unite and return.
Again, [recite] **□□□□□□** (朝太一), fiery brilliance illuminating their form!
Again, the **Sutra of the Subdued Soul** (幽魂受正法) is invoked,
All sentient beings unite and return!

**Pursuit Soul Talisman of the Great Yin—Hun Yuan of the Three Realms** (太阴混元三界追魂符),
**Talisman of the Jade Purity Pursuit Soul Swift Messenger** (玉清追魂使者符),
**Talisman of the Upper Purity Pursuit Soul Swift Messenger** (上清追魂使者符),
**Talisman of the Supreme Purity Pursuit Soul Swift Messenger** (太清追魂使者符).

All these talismans must be paired with the **Jade Seal of the Five Peaks Sutra** (掐玉诀),
To extract the **Qi of the Three Purities** (三清炁).

**Offering to the Divine Tiger Altars** (供养神虎坛范):
*"The establishment of the Divine Tiger and Ghostly Officials’ altars
Requires the Five Directions to deploy their Five Talismans (五方用五篇敷落),
And place the grand **Fúlí Tu** (浮黎土) diagram at their center,
To summon them and make them stand forth immediately.
If this diagram is absent,
Then the Divine Tiger and Ghostly Officials lack their corresponding **contractual light** (契合之光),
And they cannot arrive.

Moreover, on the day of the ritual,
One must recite the **Three Chapters of the Demon King** (魔王三章),
And burn the **Red Book of the Jade Seal** (赤书玉字) and the **Two Chapters of the Eight威威龙威威威龙文** (龙文).
The **Heavenly Gate Talisman Officials** (天门将符吏)
Cannot be summoned unless the **original ancestral script of the Heavenly Qi—True Seal of the Jade Seal** (天元祖炁真文玉字) is invoked.
These two chapters are the **prohibited secrets of the Mysterious Capital** (玄都至禁),
By which the **Primordial Sovereign of the Beginning** (元始天尊) summons all the Heavenly Emperors,
the **Three Realms of Sentient Beings** (三界万灵).
When these chapters are recited,
And their **true script** (真文) is inscribed,
All the **Ten Thousand Saints** (万圣) will see the **jade light** (玉光) and come forth.

The **Língbǎo Upper Dao** (灵宝上道) is not a minor technique;
Its entirety lies in **refining the form and purifying the self** (思形炼已),
**preserving the Qi and guarding the spirit** (守炁存神),
And **refining the body as the Primordial Sovereign’s true form** (炼身如元始天尊之真身),
To achieve **enlightenment equal to that of the Heavenly Sovereign** (与天尊而同慧).
Only then can one attain **harmonized success** (同达).
If one does not comply with the ritual norms,
Or lacks deep contemplation,
All prior efforts will be in vain,
And no effect will be seen.
Instead, one will invite **retribution from the High Worthies** (反招谴谪),
And only incur their **blame** (徒怨於高真).

**Divine Tiger Seal and Talisman** (神虎印章):
*"Performing the Divine Tiger Jade Seal to pursue the soul,
There are four seals in total, to be used during the sacrifice.
If there is a talisman but no seal,
It is like having soldiers without a commander.
If there is a seal but no talisman,
It is like having a commander without soldiers.
Without the seals and talismans,
The **steps of the Bagua** (步罡) cannot summon the spirits,
And the **ritual officers** (发役) cannot drive them forth—
Omitting even one is unacceptable.
Thus, the **Língbǎo Method** (灵宝法) is fully complete,
And there is never any failure.

The **First Seal** (第一印) is the **General Supervisor Seal of Ghosts and Gods** (总监鬼神印),
Which serves as the **overall command** (总制) of the *Língbǎo* Method.
Its text reads: **‘General Supervisor of All Spirits’** (总监众灵四字).
When used, pinch the **General Supervisor Seal** (总监印),
Extract the **Qi of Língbǎo** (灵宝中炁),
Blow upon it and apply.

The **Special Seal of the Jade Seal** (专印玉札总监诀) is pressed with the middle finger,
Straight and centered.
This seal is held by the **Great Demon King of the Five Emperors** (五帝大魔王).

The **Second Seal** (第二印) is the **Inner Taboo Seal of the Northern Marquis** (北魁夫人内讳之章),
Which is the **sole authority** (专权) of the *Jade Seal* (玉司).
This seal is used for **Special Summoning Talismans** (摄召等旛).
When applied, use the **Bagua of the Dipper** (斗罡),
Pinch the **Dipper Seal** (斗诀),
Extract the **mysterious Qi of the North** (北方玄炁),
And blow upon it before use.

The **Third Seal** (第三印) is called the **Northern Marquis Mysterious Seal** (北魁玄范之印),
Or the **Jade Seal of the Left Wing** (雄左玉印).
It is worn on the **left elbow** (左肘),
To summon the **Divine Tiger Marshal** (神虎主伯),
And to press the **True Form Talisman of the Marshal** (主伯吏真形符).
These three seals are **offered to the Yang-Yào Altar** (供养於阳耀坛中).
After use, they are stored in a **stitched pouch** (缝袋).

The **Fourth Seal** (第四印) is called the **Jade Seal of the Right Wing** (雌右玉印),
Worn on the **right elbow** (右肘).
It is used to summon the **Marshal Officials** (主吏),
And to press the **True Form Talismans of the Marshal Officials and Jade Maiden Functionary** (主吏使者，玉女功曹真形符).
These three seals are **offered to the Yin-Jīng Altar** (供养於阴精坛中).
After use, they are stored in a **stitched pouch** (缝袋).

**General Supervisor Seal of Ghosts and Gods** (总监鬼神印),
**Divine Tiger Inner Taboo Seal** (神虎内讳印).」

**Divine Tiger Yin-Seal** and **Divine Tiger Yang-Seal**, as well as the **Right-Standing Seal**, are to be inscribed on *jiǎzǐ* days when the heavens are clear and the *qi* is serene. They are carved from peachwood.

**Ritual for Inscribing Seals**
The ritual requires tea, wine, and nine kinds of fruits, divided into nine portions. On an auspicious day, in a purified chamber, the offerings are made.

The officiant faces north, recites the *Divine Tiger Manifestation Mantra*, and with the left hand, presses the middle finger against the base of the thumb, then reverses to press the thumb against the base of the middle finger. Taking three steps forward toward the *Dīng* direction, he chants the incantation, inhales *qi* twelve times, and blows it forth.

Visualizing beneath the Northern Marshal a ninefold *zǐhuán qi* descending into the seal, he bows and invokes the spell. Upon completion, he anoints the seal with wine, places it in a purified basin, and lets four *fen* of gold coins settle upon it. Then, he stores it in a secluded, pure place—never to be seen by others, lest its power fade. After twelve years, it must be re-carved and formally reported for replacement. The old seal is discarded in a remote cave where no one treads.

**Incantation for Inscribing the Seal**
*"Heavenly One of the North, Supreme One of Purple Primordium,*
*Divine Tiger Marshal, Great Sage of the Dipper,*
*Jade Maiden of Soul-Pursuit, Ten Ten-Thousand Precision Soldiers,*
*Follow my command, descending in response—*
*One call, one [obedient] breath.*
*Enter my seal, transforming into myriad forms.*
*Original, Benevolent, Auspicious, and True—*
*Swift as the Divine Tiger’s decree!"*

Recite this fourteen times, focusing the sacred position and the ascending *zǐhuán qi* with the incense smoke into the seal. After the ritual, store it in a stitched pouch.

Whenever the *yuèdàn* (first day of the lunar month) arrives, the master wears the seal, taps his teeth, and chants:
*"The Divine Tiger Seal—mighty, responsive, and numinous!*
*I now wear it always, that I may endure.*
*Pursue souls, subdue spirits—*
*Instantly reveal their True Forms!*
*Swift as the edicts of the Jade Purity Supreme Deity!"*

**Ritual for Sacrificing to the Seal**
The *Huángrén* states: *"The ritual for sacrificing to the seal requires twelve cups of jujube broth, twelve cups of purified tea, twelve lamps, and twelve *fen* each of gold coins and horses, arranged beneath the Celestial Gate. When the star hosts appear, the officiant dons his robes and cap, focuses his mind, and offers incense. He recites the Transformation Mantra of the Divine Tiger, drawing the ten-directional *qi* with his middle finger and left hand into his body, transforming himself into the *Lingbǎo Tiānzūn*.

Standing *Dīng* and facing south, he walks the eight trigrams toward the Heavenly Pole, turns to face the Celestial Gate, and pays three obeisances before rising. In silence, he petitions the Supreme Deity, stating his transmitted ritual matters: ‘Today, I select this day to perform the sacrificial rites in accordance with the law. I humbly pray that the Three Venerables, in their compassion, descend the three *qi* into the seal. Dispatch the Gold Boy and Jade Girl attendants—twenty-four each—to serve as guards. May my use of the seal be responsive, its effects manifesting as I will. May all the Ten Directions’ Holy Ones bear witness.’

He bows three times, inhales the three *qi* of the Celestial Gate, and blows them forth. Then, kneeling at full length, he holds each seal with both hands—*dàshà* and *wén* gestures—pressing it to his forehead and recites:*

*'Essence of the Manifested, Radiant and Numinous,*
*Subtle Might, Heavenly Splendor,*
*Heavenly Form, Resplendent Sound,*
*Great Transformation, Primordial Axis,*

**The Sixty-Seventh Scroll of the Great Method of the *Lingbao Scripture* for Deliverance of Innumerable Beings is concluded.**
**The Sixty-Eighth Scroll of the Great Method of the *Lingbao Scripture* for Deliverance of Innumerable Beings: The Refining and Deliverance of Talismans**

**The Method of Descending the Supreme Lord’s True Water and Fire**

The Imperial Sage declares:
*"The realm of the departed is a land of darkness and obscurity;*
*suffering souls linger, their spirits stagnant, their bodies foul and impure, bound like prisoners at the well.*
*Without the *qi* of Heaven and Earth, without the refining and deliverance of the Method, how could they attain awakening?*
*Thus, the Mysterious Sovereign, moved by compassion, bestows this text of molten fire and smelting, so that those who follow the Law may embody the Primordial Origin’s transformative form,*
*gather the primordial *qi* of Yin and Yang,*
*harmonize the three *tians*’ radiance,*
*borrow the three *qi* of the Southern Fire,*
*ascend and descend the pure and turbid,*
*sever the Ghostly Gate,*
*purge filth and defilement,*
*until inner and outer shine with clarity,*
*and the hundred limbs glow with light—*
*only then may they realize the Dao of Non-Action."*

Thus, when summoning souls, one must first use the *Beidou* scriptures to gather their spirits and sever their corpses, then employ the *Nanji* seal to register them in the celestial ledger. Hence, the Southern Star and Northern Dipper mold souls and cast spirits, enabling them to return to form, traverse the Great Void—this is the supreme Dao of the *Lingbao*.

The Imperial Sage declares:
*"The Law Officer, holding the tally and preserving transformation, pays homage as prescribed, silently petitioning the Supreme Deity to descend the Supreme Lord’s True Water and True Fire."*

First, one must purify the body of defilement, walk the Nine Phoenix *gang* formation, reaching the *doukou* (mouth of the Dipper). There, pinch three times to offer incense, bow twice, and proceed as the Method dictates.

**The Nine Phoenix *Gang* Formation**

The Imperial Sage declares:
*"The left hand holds the Master’s spell-seal, the right grasps the Talisman of Purifying Defilement, maintaining the body while stepping through the *gang*, ingesting the talisman, and advancing with single steps of the left and right feet."*

**The Nine Phoenix Talisman of Purifying Defilement**
**The Talisman of the Pure *Fanyin* of the Verdant Deeps**

The Imperial Sage declares:
*"This talisman is inscribed with both hands using the *Chen* spell-seal, one covering, one uplifted, drawn from the heart to the hairline.*
*Close the eyes, envisioning the Primordial Origin, a round symbol arising at the nape—*
*holding the *ruyi* scepter, a nine-hued radiance emanating from the forehead,*
*transforming into a five-colored lion throne,*
*purple clouds enveloping the body,*
*inner and outer luminous,*
*all Ten Directions’ worthies paying homage.*
*Then, channeling *qi*, inhale the three *qi* onto the brush.*
*Next, pinch the middle joint of the middle finger, stand facing east, and complete the inscription.*
*Then, strike the teeth nine times to unblock them, swallow saliva nine times.*
*Afterward, gather the five *zang*-organs’ colored *qi* and infuse them into the talisman, bowing to present the petition, seal, and inscription.*
*This is swallowed with a bamboo-shoot decoction.*
*When inscribed upon the altar, it can summon the worthies of the Ten Directions to descend."*

**Verbal Petition for the Water and Fire Rites**

*"The humble servant [Name], unworthy and defiled in body, presumptuously receiving the Master’s transmission, has obtained the Sacred Scriptures and follows the true teaching to save the living and deliver the dead, fulfilling my vow.*
*With sincere words, I humbly petition—*
*may Heaven hear."*

**"With trembling sincerity and great fear, I kneel and bow my head to speak reverently.**

Now, in accordance with the solemn vows of fasting, I, the humble servant [Name], undertake the refining and liberation of the departed soul(s) of [Deceased], not daring to suppress or extinguish the compassionate wishes of the Imperial subjects. I earnestly present my petition to:

- **The Grand Celestial Sovereign, the Northern Pole’s Purple Microcosm Heavenly Emperor (祖师北极紫微大天帝)**
- **The Grand Celestial Sovereign, the Southern Pole’s Regenerating Emperor (祖师南极注生大帝君) before whom I bow**

I humbly pray that **Divine Benevolence** may specially bestow **Illuminating Decrees** upon the **Water and Fire Departments** and the **Five Peaks’ Supreme Commanders**, beseeching them to descend the **Essential Roots of Yin and Yang**, the **True Water** and **True Fire**.

On this very day and hour, let them descend to the altar’s sacred precincts to refine and liberate the departed souls, so that their **spirit and soul may be clarified and rectified**, their **ten thousand *qi* eternal**, their **forms and bodies complete**, and they may regain **radiance and light**, ascending to the Heavenly Treasury. May they rely upon **Heavenly Might**, be **clearly discerned by Divine Wisdom**, and be liberated.

I, the humble servant, prostrate in reverence, await **Heaven’s Manifested Favor** with boundless gratitude. My longing for Heaven’s blessings and my devotion to the **Sacred** are most fervent; I await punishment for my crimes with utmost humility.

**The Imperial Decree for the Ritual Officials:**
Hold the **Divine Tablet**, strike the teeth nine times, **preserve the spirit**, and silently petition the **Northern Emperor’s rites** with three bows. Then silently petition, facing **east-north**, and recite the **Water Science**. Burn the **True Water Talisman** and the **True Fire Talisman** together, completing the process before proceeding with the refining and liberation.

**The Supreme True Fire Decree:**
*Leap of the Tiger (寅) upon the Hare (卯), the Hare upon the Tiger—wind and fire intertwine. When the **Perverse Fire** (巽午) is purged, first inhale the *qi* of the **Southern Fire** three times, then blow it into the **charcoal fire**.*
Use the **Great General of the Master Fire Talisman**: first burn it within the **ritual compass**, then face **south-east** and summon it to the altar’s base.
**Incantation:**
*"I humbly request the Great General of the Master Fire, one army, to descend and manifest the **True Fire** for refining and liberating the departed souls. With the *qi* of the South, I blow into the fire pit, and the fire rises with **half-green, half-red *qi**."*

**The Supreme True Water Decree:**
*With the left hand, hold the **Child Diagram** (子文); with the right hand, hold the **Hare Diagram** (亥文). First inhale the *qi* of the **Northern Pole** five times, then blow it into the **water pool**.*
Use the **Great General of the Master Water Talisman**: first burn it within the **ritual compass**, then face **north-east** and call it to the altar’s base.
**Incantation:**
*"I humbly request the Great General of the Master Water, to descend and manifest the **True Water**, for refining and liberating the departed souls. With the *qi* of the North, I blow into the water pool."*
**Second Incantation:**
*"I humbly request the **Seven Ancestors of the Supreme One** hovering in the void, the **Northern Yin’s Mysterious Officials**, and their messengers to swiftly descend the **True *Qi****. Again, I inhale the *qi* of the North once, blowing it into the water, and preserve the **black *qi* rising within the water**."*

**The Sacred Treasure of Pure Heaven and Earth Talisman**
*Burn the talisman on yellow paper with vermilion script, reciting the **Heavenly Emperor’s Decree** three times.*
**Incantation:**
*"Divine Spirits of Heaven’s True Essence, the Jade Purity’s Primordial Truth.
The **Upper Pure’s** Splendid Abode, the **Primordial Lord’s** Ancient Sovereignty.
Entering the **Wondrous Azure**, the **Luminous Mysterious Text** shines forth.
The **Seven Spirits** flow like springs, the **Northern Du** receives the smoke.
I, the **Supreme Sovereign**, compel the **ghostly multitudes** to align.
With **Eight Awe-inspiring** decrees, I expel poison—revered and solemn, the **Thousandfold** impurities depart, and all malevolence is annihilated.
The **Ten Thousand** demon kings are subdued; their **life-essence is severed** and their forms clipped.
Swiftly, as the **Sacred Edict** commands. Let all violators be exterminated.
Swiftly, as the **Sacred Treasure’s Great Law** decrees to save the departed souls."*

**The Stone Scene Water Mother’s Jade Essence Talisman**
*Attach the **Supreme Stipulation of Bathing in Truth**. First recite the incantation, then inscribe the talisman.*
**Incantation:**
*"The **Eastern Well’s Yellow Blossoms**, the **Stone Scene’s Jade Essence**.
The **Mysterious Water Mother** ascends, the **Golden Nectar’s Jade Springs**.
Torrents flow endlessly, the pools and pavilions never dry.
The **Nine Dragons** irrigate and refine, the **Three Lights** descend their essence.
The **Immortal** exhales moisture, refining and liberating the **souls**.
Within and without, **brightly illuminated**, the **exterior and interior** are **clearly discerned**.
The **Hundred Passages and Nine Abysses** are **nourished by the Primordial *Qi***.
The **Five *Zang*-organs and Six *Fu*-organs**, the **Ten Thousand Spirits** arise naturally.
The **fetal sacs and embryonic nodes** open with the water, as the gates are unlocked.
Death does not bring **final annihilation**; evil is **absolutely severed** from **sinking into ruin**.
Now I refine and transform—**the corpse’s *qi* gives birth to the soul**.
Returning to its original form, the **jade body and golden visage** are renewed.
Through **transformation and refinement**, impurities are purged, and it ascends to the **Purple Court**.
Swiftly, as the **Great Emperor’s Command** decrees."*

*After reciting, inhale the *qi* of the North and the **current day’s Great Yin *Qi*** into the brush, **close the *qi*** while inscribing the talisman, and invoke it with the **Eastern Well’s Hymn and Decree**.*
**Incantation:**
*"The **Heavenly River** irrigates the **Eastern Well**; the **Stone Scene’s Water Mother’s Essence** shines.
The **Mysterious Light** sweeps across the **Soul’s Radiance**, the **Round Luster** reflects upon the **High Clarity**.
The **Primordial Lord** dispels the **Heavy Darkness**, and **Heavenly Humans** are born anew with the **moon’s cycle**."*

**The Primordial Lord’s Stipulation for the Departed:**
*"The **Primordial Heavenly Sovereign** resides in the **Seven Treasures’** Forest of Cypress, emitting **Great Radiance** to illuminate all above and below—those with **unfulfilled vows** who do not see the light, **stagnate** and are lost in the **marsh of confusion**, drifting in the **bitter sea**, with no means to escape.

Thus, the **Heavenly Sovereign**, moved by pity, descends these **Sacred Stipulations** to rescue and liberate the **culpable souls**, enabling them to ascend to the **Dao-realm** and **forever escape suffering’s causes**.

Those who receive the **Law** must **purify their hearts and clear their minds**, focus their thoughts on the **Supreme Way**, and follow the **Law’s injunctions**. Only then will the **Netherworld’s** souls be **salvaged and delivered**.

**The Upper Pure’s Sacred Treasure Primordial Stipulation:**
I solemnly declare to the **Three Officials of Heaven’s Prison and Earth’s Barrier**, the **Superintending Spirits**, and the **refining and liberating** deities: *"I supercede and liberate the departed soul(s) of [Name], enabling them to ascend to the **Pure and Subtle Heaven**.*

The **Hundred Spirits** blend harmoniously, **transforming and manifesting as True Essence**, forever departing from **Death’s Domain**. Their **bodies become Jade-Light**, and they **hold the Jade Talismans**, attending at the **Dragon’s Chariot**, just as the **Stipulation commands**."*

**The Primordial Lord’s Edict:**
*"The **Sacred Luminance** of **Purple Orchids**, the **Supreme Purity’s High Void**.
The **Supreme Truth’s Mysterious Dawn**, where the **Three *Qi*** float upon **Jade Purity**.
With **Eight Observations**, the **wondrous paths** are **clearly illuminated**, and **Nine Crossroads** reveal **marvelous enlightenment**.
The **Primordial Green** initiates the **cosmic diagram**; in response to **sentient beings’** suffering, the **Demon’s Celestial Metropolis** is dissolved, and **Cinnabar Essence** refines the **embryonic purity**.
Riding the **Imperial Chariot**, they **soar freely**.
The **Three Pure Ones** grant **curved pardons**, dispelling the **night’s darkness**.
The **Five Peaks and Nine Abysses**, without obstruction, reach the **Du of the Netherworld**.
The **Pralaya** couch is **pierced through**.
I descend to **rescue the Three Torments, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties**, removing all **bitterness and calamity**.

*its transformations beyond measure.*
*The *qi* is resonant with form,*

*Now, for the departed [name],*

*and surely with accumulated sins of past lives.*
*Thus, the officials of the Luó and the Nine Abysses*

*there is the Most High Great Luó’s Jade Capital and Golden Gate,*
*The Alliance of the True’s decree,*
*secreted within the Jade Register,*

*Since the opening of the Crimson Bright’s diagram,*
*The Original Beginning’s Heavenly Sage has spoken,*
*The scripture for saving suffering and extracting sins,*
*and with all the myriad saints formed a pact and sworn,*
*to vow in countless kalpas*
*to save and liberate suffering souls,*
*thus it is called the Alliance of the True.*

*The Alliance of the True has three grades.*
*The highest is the Upper Primordial’s Golden Edict,*
*The middle is the Middle Primordial’s Jade Edict,*
*The lowest is the Lower Primordial’s Yellow Edict.*
*In summary, the ritual implements are complete in the Lower Primordial.*

*Now, the Most High Alliance of the True’s Yellow Edict,*
*for the boundless liberation of the dark and bright,*
*—is fully prepared.*

*For the sake of the practitioners,*
*the rites are meticulously outlined,*
*and must not be carelessly revealed to unworthy individuals,*
*lest the Three Primordials be confused,*
*and sins be invoked without pardon.*

*If such individuals are encountered,*
*do not transmit the rites,*
*lest the Dao’s grace be obstructed,*
*and Heaven’s retribution swiftly arrive.*
*Heed this warning carefully.*

*The Nine Heavenly Edicts.*
*The Middle Primordial’s Golden Script, the Nine Heavenly Edicts.*

*The Supreme’s Edict,*
*proclaiming to the Three Officials,*
*the Heavenly Prisons,*

*for the departed [name].*
*All receive the Edict,*

*The Edict is received,*
*and ascends to the Heavenly Court.*
*Sins and grudges are harmonized,*
*and the soul merges with the Dao,*
*ascending to the Jade Gate,*
*undergoing refinement,*
*and enduring forever.*
*—As decreed in the proclamation,*
*transmitted by wind and fire messengers."*

Year　　Month　　Day　　Hour—*Proclamation Issued*

At the time of writing the Edict, face the northwest in a long kneel, burn incense, and invoke the Nine Celestial Sovereigns of the Nine Heavenly Dao. Dress as the Emperor in *guan* crown and vermilion clouds with emerald robes and flying feathers. After silently petitioning, chant the *Nine Celestial Birth-God Chapter* nine times. Take the *Nine Qi* radiance to blow upon the brush, inscribe the talisman, then chant once more. Blow the *Qi* onto the talisman as before, and together with the *Yuqing Decisive Formula*, recite before the Three Treasures, then deliver to the departed to be burned in the blue smoke.

The Edict text spans four lines, with the year and month on one line.
*The Edict is inscribed in vermilion on yellow paper, while the Proclamation may be written in ink on plain paper or silk/brocade—just as with worldly edicts and imperial decrees.*

After the *Degree of the Soul* is proclaimed at night, it is given to the departed spirit.

**Law-Alcohol Talisman**
*The Imperial Sage says:* After refining and purifying through water and fire, bestow the *Law-Alcohol* and refine it. When inscribing the *Law-Alcohol Talisman*, use yellow paper of seven *cun*, face southeast, and recite the *Three Heavenly Hidden Names*. Take its *Qi* to inscribe the talisman. Burn it to ash, mix with alcohol, and offer it to the departed soul to drink.

**Constructing the God-King’s Ascension Palanquin**
*The Imperial Sage says:* Use colorful silk to craft a purple carriage, with two God-Kings flanking the wheels and five horses pulling the palanquin. Place the departed within, awaiting the time of the *Degree Bridge* to burn it. Do not send with the departed’s banner.

*At the time of refining, summon the white banner, burn it in the water pool, then replace it with a red banner for the fire pool. After refining, burn the red banner and replace it with a yellow banner to follow the carriage, with a child guiding the soul through the Heavenly Gate.*

**Incantation for Burning the Carriage**
*Pinching the Supreme’s Formula:*
*Heavenly Lord’s mighty spirit-force,*
*Extracting and saving all souls.*
*Auspicious smoke fills the dead’s gate,*
*Joyous clouds open the birth door.*
*Return the Heavenly *Qi* to command,*
*To govern the Nine Heavenly souls.*
*Merging utterly with the Primordial One,*
*All become natural beings.*
*Riding the purple cloud-carriage,*
*Ascending to pay homage to the Mudan Lord.*

After chanting, visualize the Heavenly Lord bestowing a precious pearl, its radiance spanning ten thousand *zhang*, guiding the ascent to the Heavenly Realm.

Those who practice the **Lingbao** Great Dao/Way,
dwelling in the refined essence of those who receive alchemical transformation,
how could they fail to encounter this scripture,
wearing and carrying it upon their person,
or enshrining it within their secluded chamber?
Then ten thousand demons dare not approach,
and malevolent spirits dare not cross its boundary.
Naturally, they earn the reverence of the Ten Thousand Celestial,
with divine luminaries guarding the gate,
illuminating within and without—
no calamity shall touch them.
Truly, they safeguard against cosmic upheaval,
ensuring eternal existence beneath Heaven.

**Ritual for Fasting and Receiving Offerings, Inviting the Teacher.**

**Ritual Precepts:**

To open the path for salvation of both mortals and deities,
To rescue and protect all beings,
To uphold and establish the rites of fasting—
Without the Teacher, this cannot be accomplished.
One must be fully prepared:
Receiving talismans and seals,
Mastering the rituals and procedures,
Knowing the etiquette of bowing and rising,
Understanding the rules of advancing and retreating,
Focusing the spirit and contemplating the True One,
Opening and closing the gates of invocation,
Repelling evil without error,
Conducting the rites in proper order,
Allying with Heaven as a disciple,
Embodying the Dao without limit,
Widely opening doors and windows,
Universally rescuing the submerged and lost—
The Teacher’s virtue and merit are unmatched.

If a **Dharma Master** wears the **Three Caverns**,
Or an **Official** practices the **Mystic Cavern**,
They may be appointed accordingly.
Where positions are vacant,
A **Mystic Cavern** adept may serve as **Dharma Master**,
And a **Zhongxu Zhengyi** initiate as **Official**.

The fasting rites originate from the **Lingbao**, belonging to the **Mystic Cavern**,
And their principles align with its teachings.
Other **Ten Precepts White Scroll Daoists** must not be arbitrarily assigned ritual roles,
Nor falsely claim titles.

For those wishing to perform fasting rites to offer sacrifices,
To save the living and rescue the dead—
At the outset of preparations,
One must first seek a virtuous and diligent adept,
Either dwelling in a **Qingcheng** hall
Or secluded in mountains and forests,
Whose Daoist standing is exalted,
Whose reputation in the Mystic Gate is revered,
Whose appointment is unanimously agreed upon,
And whose divination yields favorable omens.

Afterward, purify body and mind through fasting,
Select an auspicious day,
Recite the **Heart-Sincerity Pledge** and submit to the Dao,
And present the fasting offering in devotion.

If the initial petition fails to meet the sincere invocation,
One must renew the plea with utmost sincerity,
With resolve unshaken,
And rites limited to three attempts.
Only upon receiving approval
Should the construction proceed.

For the vast Heaven and Earth,
The hidden realms and netherworlds,
The boundless lands of the Ten Directions,
The immeasurable Three Realms—
Without a **Master of High Merit** whose virtue and deeds are profound,
Whose conduct is pure and clear,
How could the hidden and manifest be fully communicated,
How could mortals and deities be harmonized without division?

Thus, those who delve deeply into the **Highest Learning**,
Who master the **Mystic Profound**,
Serving as the bridge of life and death,
As the eyes of mortals and deities—
Only they may be called **Masters of High Merit**.

But if they are merely superficial practitioners,
Lowly scholars who seek only profit,
Blindly performing rites with muddled intent,
Wasting spiritual energy and treasures—
Few escape the censure of the **Three Officials**,
How much less can they hope for divine response?

**Petition:**
Hereby, a Daoist disciple of [surname] [given name],
From [native place], along with household members [names],
Submits this plea with sincere intent.

「Humbly, it is for the departed certain one, whose lifespan was but [X] years, [Y] months, [Z] days, and [W] hours, born at [time]. Yesterday, in the year [X], month [Y], day [Z], at [time], he passed away at [location] and was interred at [burial place]. Deeply concerned for the spirit’s lingering consciousness, yet to fulfill its natural course in life.

Now, upon reaching the [specific Daoist festival or memorial date], with utmost sincerity, we have meticulously prepared the **Ten Methods of Offering** (十方法信) at [location] and invite [number] Daoist priests to [location], to solemnly establish the **Supreme Yellow Arrow Great Fast** (無上黃箓大斋), spanning [X] days and nights.

We beseech Your Reverence to perform the **Pure and Bright Funerary Rites** (浄醮) for the departed [name], to atone for his sins and transgressions, and to bestow merit upon the living and the dead. May Your Reverence also extend Your compassion to those enshrined in the **Hall of the Departed** (升度門), to our ancestors, descendants, and kindred spirits, and to all beings in the **Six Realms** (六趣) and **Three Realms of Suffering** (三涂), the **Nine Abysses** (九幽), and **Five Paths** (五道), as well as to the spirits of the netherworld, the lingering souls, and the solitary shades. Through the power of virtuous causes, may all ascend to the **Daoist Celestial Realm** (仙界).

With sincere devotion, we humbly submit this petition to the **Law Position Masters** (法位法師). May Your Reverence, in Your boundless compassion, grant this request and, according to the prescribed rites, perform the ascension and salvation.

We dare not presume upon Your favor, awaiting Your divine edict.

**Closing Words:**
In the year [X], on the [Y]th day of the [month], [day of the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch cycle], residing in [surname] [given name]’s household of [native place], we have purified ourselves in fasting and piety, bowing twice with utmost reverence. We now address the **Venerable Master of the [Daoist Sect] Sect** (某洞法師先生).

Mindful of the **Dao’s vital breath** (祖炁) and its primordial origins, all things return to the **Cosmic Covering** (覆被). The **Dao’s source** (道源) first emerged, and its transmission flows through the **True Orthodox Lineage** (真宗). Indeed, the **Highest Learning** (上学) is profound, and those who deeply grasp the **Mystic Profound** (重玄之教) are worthy of this invocation.

We earnestly pray that Your Reverence, who embodies the **Pure Dao**, penetrates the **Void of the Heart** (虚寂), and comprehends the **Three Mystic Caverns and Four Auxiliary Teachings** (三洞四辅), serves as the **Teacher of the Ten Directions and Three Realms** (十方三界之師), and opens the **Gate of the Dao** (户牖於玄门) as a **Vessel of Salvation** (舟航於苦海) across the **Sea of Suffering**. Both mortals and deities revere Your **virtue** (德), and the hidden and manifest alike receive Your **grace** (恩).

We humbly hope that Your Reverence, moved by boundless compassion, will descend upon this **Daoist Assembly** (道场), accepting our offerings and performing the rites. Through **divine intervention**, may the **Three Realms and Ten Directions** (三界十方) be illuminated, and Your commands bestowed in **sacred talismans** (符), to rescue the souls from the **Nine Abysses** (九泉) and extinguish their suffering. May the **Auspicious Clouds** (庆云) descend endlessly, and the **Spiritual Wind** (灵风) gather, so that the departed’s remains dissolve into mist.

Thus, the spirits of the departed may receive their due and attain the **Fruit of Ascension** (登真之果). Further, we hope that all **Six Paths of Consciousness** (六道) and **Nine Mystic Realms** (九玄) may achieve **Liberation** (解脱), reaching the **Shores of the Mysterious and Remote** (希夷之岸). Our reliance upon Your guidance is profound; our words, though inadequate, are offered with utmost sincerity. We humbly pray, awaiting Your favor.

**Invocation:**
As the **Highest Master** (高功) ascends to the **Sacred Platform** (升座), the **Assembly of the Law** (法众) stands in order, and the **Ritual of the Hall** (启堂法事) begins, the disciple submits his words and concludes. The **Highest Master** then presents the incense and intones the prayer:

*"Within the **Floating World** (浮黎国内), amidst the **Jade Capital Mountains** (玉京山中), for countless aeons the **Vital Breath** (炁) has congealed into mist, and countless beings have attained **Sincere Communication** (通诚达信). The **Root of the Soul** (根盘) lies beneath the **Cynomorium Forest** (骞林), while the **Auspicious Radiance** (瑞蔼) fills the **Boundless Void** (太虚空). The **Sacred Incense** (宝香) burns in the **Golden Furnace** (金炉), and all beings in the **Three Realms and Ten Directions** (三界十方) bow in reverence.*

*"With incense burning, holding the talisman, we now present our plea:*
To supply the **Three Pure Ones** (三清) and the **Three Realms** (三境), the **Ten Extremes** (十极) and **Ten Directions** (十华), the **Supreme Ultimate Truth** (無上至真), the **Daoist Scriptures** (道经), and the **Ten Thousand Spirits and Ten Thousand Truths** (千灵万真) with the **Yellow Arrow Sacred Rites** (黄箓宝斋), invoking the **True Sovereign** (真宰) to respond with grace.

We pray that You, **riding the Dragon and the Phoenix** (骖龙驾凤), **walking upon the Void** (步虚), descend to this **Daoist Assembly** (道场), witnessing our **meritorious deeds** (功德) and aligning with the **Mystic Profound** (奥妙同元).

For the **One Ultimate Truth** (一真) yet to be fully revealed, its **statutory origin** (布机) stems from the **Three Primordial Breaths** (三炁). The **Doctrine of the Absolute** (寂寂至无之宗) and the **Natural Transformation** (荡荡自然之化) were born from the **Primordial Sovereign** (象帝), hidden within the **Void of the Mystic Caverns** (空洞之中). **Primordial Beginning** (元始) unfolded the **Five Classics** (五篇) in the **Azure Clouds** (碧落), while **Mystic Cavern** (洞玄) revealed the **Ten Degrees of Perfection** (十度) in the **Original Chapter** (本章).

The **principle of eternal generation** (生生之义) is boundless and inexhaustible. The **source of transformation** (化化之源) is nameless and unfathomable. It governs the **opening and closing of the Two Primordial Forces** (两仪), enabling all things to be **transformed and perfected** (化成). Its **virtue** (德) is inherently benevolent, standing alone in the **Way of Everlasting Generation** (常生之道). Its **merit** (功) is without end, for who can comprehend the **True Sovereign’s** (真宰) **mystic designs** (筌)?

The **Dao is beyond naming** (非常道), and its **name is beyond naming** (非常名). It does not abandon mortals nor does it forsake the myriad things. From the **Three Sovereigns** (三皇) onward, the **Dao and humanity were whole**. By the **Five Emperors** (五帝), the **Dao withdrew from humanity**. As **human deceit prevailed** (人伪胜), **Heavenly Principle** (天理) perished, and **illusionary realms** (幻境) obscured **enlightened awareness** (觉性). Unable to preserve life yet clinging to the **Spirit** (神), mortals further strayed from the **True Dao** (本真) and adhered to falsehood.

Life and death arise from this **mechanism** (机), and all beings return to it. **Right mindfulness** (正念) is obscured by **greed, anger, and delusion** (喜怒贪嗔), while the **True Dao** (真常) is abandoned for **dream and illusion** (梦幻泡影). Thus, beings invite their own **ruin** (死坏) and depart from their **original nature** (本真).

Mortals are not spared the **ghostly retribution** (鬼责) of their sins, as the **blades of ice and frost** (雪刃霜锋) strike without mercy. The **flaming fires of the Hell Realms** (炎炎烈火狱) and the **chilling pools of the Cold Hills** (峨峨丘寒池) await them all, born from a single **errant thought** (一念). Their cries of lamentation know only the **inevitability of karma** (宿命).

Yet the **Body of Salvation** (救苦化身) remains unmet, and the **grace of the Supreme** (霈恩) does not reach them. Their **sins persist** (众罪), and their **suffering knows no end** (流吹不息).

Only the **Supreme Sage** (太上) can rescue them by the **hair’s breadth** (拔领), spreading the **Yellow Arrow Scriptures** (黄箓之文) and establishing the **Bright Daoist Precepts** (明真之典). With the **Five Phoenixes and Eight Cranes** (五凤八鸾) as Your chariot, You seek salvation in the **Ten Directions**. With the **Nine Dragons and Two Tigers** (九龙二虎) as Your talismans, You open the **Six Paths of Rebirth**.

You transform the **Cloudy Ford** (云浦) into the **fermented rice of the Snowy Fields** (雪腴之醴), and dissipate the **fiery veils** (火翳) into the **Spiritual Light of the Sacred Treasure** (灵宝之光). The **Sword Trees** (剑树) are felled, and the **Boiling Cauldrons** (镬汤) still the waves. You summon all **netherworld officials** (阴冥之主吏), who obey Your **sacred rites** (济度之科条).

The **Three Realms** (三界) all submit in devotion, and all beings rejoice. When the **Nine Volumes** (九卷) are complete, the **Spirit of the Beautiful and Radiant** (丽华) is liberated. When a single soul is saved, the **Northern Emperor** (北帝) requests further supplication. This is the **Supreme Cause** (无上之缘), yielding the **inestimable Fruit** (难量之果).

Indeed, from the **Primordial Sovereign** (元皇) onward, the **Dao’s transformations** (敷化) have unfolded, and the **sages have transmitted its teachings** (列圣流通)."

「The *Sutra* is divided into thirty-six sections, yet the **Great Rite of Salvation** (黄箓) takes precedence in saving souls.
The **fasting ranks** (斋列) span seventy-two degrees, but the **Yellow Rite** (黄箓) alone stands supreme.

The **Daoist sage** (葛左玄) received the **Great Cavern’s Essence** (大洞之旨), while **Zhang Jing** (张静应) restored the **Orthodox One’s Scriptures** (正一之文).
The **Dao’s origins** (源) branch into myriad schools yet flow boundless and unobstructed, while its **teachings** (法) unfold through sutras and traditions, continuous and unending.
Not only does it encompass **universal merit** (功德) of vast breadth, but it also upholds **forbidding precepts** (禁戒) with solemn authority.

No mere **sincere devotion** (丹诚) suffices—it must be **single-minded and pure** (惟一惟精)—for the **Yellow Rite’s Grand Framework** (大范) cannot be perceived or witnessed by the unworthy.

Now, I, **Official of the Yellow Rite Great Fast** (黄箓大斋官), having taken refuge in the **Ten Extremes** (十极), humbly petition the **Three Heavens** (三天), bearing **filial piety and reverence** (先思孝) to extend salvation across countless generations, and through fasting and merit-making, to bestow blessings upon all **virtuous souls** (群爽).

I present **embroidered silk** (纹缯) with meticulous preparation, and hold **sacred vows** (质信) with grave solemnity.
I widely invite the **pure and tranquil** (清静之流), and establish the **Assembly of Illuminating the True** (明真之会), hoping to attract **worthy disciples** (上士) to propagate this **Great Dao** (大道).

Alas, I am but a **living corpse in the dusty world** (尘世行尸), a **novice of the Mystic Gate** (玄门末学), presuming to receive the **Ninefold Blindfolded Precepts** (九盲之戒), and to grasp the **Three Caverns’ Scriptures** (三洞之文). My understanding has yet to penetrate the **True Essence** (洞真)—how could I ever achieve such **perfection of form and spirit** (形神俱妙)?

My **virtue is shallow** (德惟翦薄), and I cannot make **heaven and earth unite in harmony** (天地同归).
Thus, I ought to be **cast aside and silenced** (隳肢体而黜聪明), to dwell in **mountains and marshes** (山林), and to sever all **worldly traces** (尘迹), lest I sully the **Dao’s sacred words** (丹词).

Yet, after the **fierce trials** (战灼), I now recognize the **depth of my devotion** (精虔之至), and dare not neglect the **sacred rites and precepts** (科简), praying to the **Azure Sovereign** (苍昱).

With **unwavering foolishness** (愚不转之心), I proclaim the **Dao’s effortless transformation** (无为之化).
How unlike **carrying mountains to cross the sea** (挟山而超海), or **severing cranes to mend ducks** (断鹤而绩凫)—such futile endeavors!

A **short rope cannot draw water from a deep well** (短绠不可以汲渊), and the **Great Framework** (大方) will surely scorn me.
Fortunately, the **karmic conditions** (因缘) are favorable, and I have been **guided by worthy teachers** (自翊赞得人), all of whom are **jewel tortoises of the Law Sea** (法海之元龟) and **master craftsmen of the sect** (宗门之大匠).

They **mutually uplift and inspire** (更相汲引), not disdaining even the **lowly and foolish** (凡愚).
Together, we shall **abide by the precepts** (受於戒言), striving to **fulfill the rites of sacrifice** (祀事).

Moreover, the **sacred rites and precepts** (科条) are fully recorded, with **merits and demerits clearly delineated** (功过悉分).
The **books of the Three Officials and Five Emperors** (三官五帝之书), the **registries of the Nine Departments and Four Offices** (九府四司之录), are **without omission or error** (毫分无失，纤芥不遗).
I dare not **overlook or slight** (简慢) these, lest I **destroy the blessings of my devout offerings** (隳荐修之福).

I must **pledge to heaven and earth** (盟告天地), **swear by the spirits** (质誓鬼神), and **pour forth my sincere heart** (罄丹心), harboring no **contrary thoughts** (异念).
I shall **make my merits shine in the sacred register** (功标丹简), allowing the **Seven Ancestors** (七祖) to **ascend to heaven** (生天), and **not let my sins bind me to the dark ledger** (罪结黑书), lest I **fall into the Nine Abysses** (九玄之堕地).

At the **moment of ascending the platform** (登坛之际), and at the **beginning of receiving my duties** (受职之初), all shall **hold fast to their vows** (秉誓言), and **submit to the Holy Judgment** (干圣鉴).

Now, the **fasting hall is solemnly prepared** (斋庄既肃), and the **pledge has been proclaimed to the heavens** (盟告云周).
With **jade pendants chiming** (佩玉锵锵), their sound **resonates across the Ten Directions** (见十方之振响).
In **majestic rites and dignified conduct** (威仪济济), I **invite the myriad saints to witness** (仰万圣以临观).
With **pure and unified resolve** (洁志同诚), I **raise the victorious rites** (举扬胜事).

The **Mystic Gate’s Rite of Salvation** (度亡玄局) begins: **Master of the Mystic Gate** (玄师) instructs,
*"Having accepted the sacred words* (既承投词), chosen a **auspicious site** (吉地), and selected a **propitious day** (卜日) to announce the fasting,
command all **kindred souls and like-minded disciples** (同志) to enter the **Pure Hall** (靖所) and fast in unison,
and to **pre-notify the Heavenly Expanse** (上穹), dispatching **sacred petitions** (修札) to the **Ten Heavens, Nine Earths, and Nine Provinces** (十天九地), without fail.

**Recite the sutra’s titles** (持诵经号), and **proclaim the rites and teachings** (敷宣科教).
**Burn incense and perform the fast** (行香修斋), **erect the platform and offer the tablets** (建坛贡章),
and **summon the spirits to manifest** (召摄视现).
**Issue sacred talismans and commands** (颁符命) to await **their responsive appearance** (感通),
for **merits are complete and spirits manifest** (功周幽显), and **names are inscribed in the Jade Pure** (名刊玉清).
All under heaven **hold gratitude for the virtue** (普天怀德), and **ascend swiftly on the appointed day** (克日飞升).

The **final injunction** (诀) is as follows:
The **words of acceptance** (投词) are the **pledge of the Yellow Rite disciples** (大斋弟子之词).
Their **intent must be filial, merciful, loyal, and upright** (孝慈忠直), **earnest and without selfishness** (恳切无私), only then may they be **granted salvation** (允度).

**Choosing an auspicious site** (吉地) means selecting **sacred mountains, Cavernly Heavens, or blessed lands** (名山洞天福地), **Pure Halls, Mystic Platforms, or Daoist temples** (靖庐玄坛宫观).
It must **not be a battlefield** (兵阵战场), **slaughterhouse, prison, or place of death** (屠坊刑狱), nor a **birthplace, grave, or defiled ground** (生产冢墓).
All other **pure and untainted lands** (秽恶之地) are considered **auspicious sites** (吉地).
It is **not permissible to begin** (开建) without one.

**Selecting a propitious day** (卜日告斋) must fall upon the **Three Elements, Eight Festivals, Five Sacrificial Periods, and Ten Rectifications** (三元八节，五腊十直), the **Three Assemblies’ Days** (三会之日), or the **auspicious anniversary of the departed** (亡灵七七周祥讳日).
It must also align with the **time of universal salvation** (普度之时), particularly on **Heavenly Grace Days** (天赦甲子), when the **sacrificial period, festival, or elemental cycle** (元腊节会) coincides.
Such days are **propitious** (吉日)—without them, the rites may not commence.

The **announcement of the fast** (告斋) marks the **initial resolution** (立意之初), **communicating with the Mystic Origin** (通达玄元).
The **day of beginning** (某日) is the **commencement** (始也).

**Kindred souls** (同志) are those who **share the same resolve** (志同).
**Kindred disciples and platform-mates** (同学上道) are those who **share the same teacher and platform** (同师同坛之友).

**The spirits of the Pure Hall** (靖所) are **both manifest and latent** (幽显).
If one is not **worthy**, the **harmonious qi** (和气) will not arise, and **they will not enjoy the merits of the rites** (有享功果).
From the **day of announcing the fast** (告斋之日) onward, one must **enter the Pure Hall** (入靖所), **avoiding all worldly affairs** (不交人事), and **fast for a hundred days, ninety days, forty-nine days, or thirty-two days** (对斋百日，九十日，四十九日，三十二日), as deemed appropriate.
The **duration of fasting** (量) should be **proportionate to the number of souls being saved** (所度亡者多寡), and the **extent of ritual preparation** (修文备事).
Do not **restrict the rites** (狭) for fear of **insufficient provisions** (阙), nor **expand them** (广) without proper cause.

**Seven days prior** (前期七日), one must **notify the Three Realms, Nine Earths, Ten Heavens, Ten Dao Paths, and the Nine Provinces, Northern Capital, and Netherworld Registries** (十天十道，九州北都冥府等).
At the **beginning of the fast** (告斋之始), one must **urge the karmic connections** (劝缘) of the **principal fast participants** (大斋之首), as well as those who **seek salvation for departed souls** (求度亡魂之家), and the **kindred disciples and platform-mates** (同志同学之人).
All must **fast and bathe in purity** (斋戒沐浴), and **recite the True Scriptures** (持诵真文).

The **True Scriptures** (真文) refer to the **sacred sutras, incantations, and titles** (荐拔亡魂经咒尊号) for **salvaging and elevating departed souls** (亡魂).
These include:
The **Great Cavern True Scripture** (大洞真经), the **Spiritual Treasure Sutra Collection** (灵宝诸经),
the **Nine Heavenly Divine Treasures’ Sacred Tablets** (九天生神宝章), the **Two Classics of Dao and Virtue** (道德二篇),
the **Yellow Court Jade Scripture** (黄庭玉经), the **Sutra of the Three Paths for Salvation and Nine Abysses for Liberation** (救苦三涂步虚九幽拔罪真经),
the **Sutra of the Sweet Dew Divine Incantations and True One** (甘露神咒真一等经),
and the **Divine Incantations of the Lingpan Heavenly Sage’s Illustrious Title** (琅函天尊睿号神咒).

**Three days before the rites commence** (开建前三日), one must **proclaim the fast’s intentions and teachings** (敷告修斋词旨), and **petition the Rectifying Yearly God** (关告直岁神君), the **Dragon Gods of Rain** (行雨主雨龙神), and the **local earthly deities** (里域土主).
One must also **invoke the City Deities, Mountain Gods, and Han Deities** (城隍山林，孟长汉真), as well as all **associated mountain officials** (属岳之司), and the **sacred lands of all Cavernly Heavens** (一切洞天福地), and the **celestial ranks of all spirit assemblies** (诸天仙曹等处).
Each must be **summoned and dispatched** (各召差神兵) to **guard the Daoist altar** (卫护道场), and to **banish malevolent and poisonous entities** (斥遂凶毒之物), **purifying and dispersing defiled qi** (浄荡秽恶之炁).

During **prolonged drought** (久晴之时), one must **ward against adverse winds and rains** (防虞风雨).
If **rain persists for too long** (久时阴雨), one must **seize the first clear day** (克日借晴).

Additionally, one must **select the most responsive spirits of the locality** (当境灵应), those **most revered by the people** (众人所钦之神), to **stand directly before the platform** (直坛) and **prevent and deter evil** (防非止恶).
This is to **warn away all non-Daoist demons and malevolent spirits** (警非道妖恶之众)."

On the night before the first day, at the hour of sunset, gather the Daoist disciples and ritual attendants at the site of the altar construction to rehearse the solemn rites and ceremonial decorum. At dawn, assemble the congregation and present yourselves before the Master of Rituals to request his ascent to the altar. Purify the altar of defilements, and from this point onward, conduct the rites for either seven days and nights, five days and nights, three days and nights, or one day and night—performing the Dao for three periods, offering incense six times, and reciting the scriptures ten revolutions. Proclaim the scriptural injunctions and admonitions, and in accordance with ancient rites, present the ritual petitions and tablets in proper sequence. Display the Five Directions’ sacred diagrams, invoke the trustworthy talismans of gold and jade as prescribed, and issue the imperial edicts and summons—all in strict adherence to the ritual laws, summoning and subjugating spirits to manifest their responses and demonstrate their efficacy.

After the fast is completed, with all hearts aligned and the ritual fulfilled, disperse the altar and offer thanks. Declare the merits achieved and duties fulfilled, with the Three Officials recommending you, the Five Emperors recording your name, the celestial hosts rejoicing, the Most High bestowing grace, and your rank ascending among the immortals. Your virtue extends to both the living and the dead, securing ascension to the heavens.

Should there be any deviation or error, no pardon shall be granted.

**The Sequential Rites of the Mystic Bureau**

The Mystic Master says: Since the Patriarch transmitted the ritual teachings and established the Great Fast, each has its proper order, all in accordance with the Mystic Bureau’s directives. For petitions, proclamations, and memorials—whether for the fast’s intent or requests for scriptural texts—they must all originate from the Great Master’s intent and be composed by his disciples. Do not rigidly adhere to outdated conventions, lest they confuse the sacred texts. Speak only what is scripturally verified; what is merely plausible but ungrounded in the Dao must not be codified within its laws. Over time, such deviations may proliferate, turning into customary norms—white stones mistaken for jade, semblances of truth without substance—thus tarnishing the purity of the Dao.

First, rehearse the ceremonial decorum. On the day before the altar’s establishment, prepare the site. At dawn on the appointed day, present the petition, request the Master’s ascent to the altar, and before the Nine Masters, submit the ritual tablets to the Mystic Bureau. The Six Officials shall present the Mystic Petition, receive their seals of office, and then proceed to the Three Treasures’ images to commence the incense offerings.

On the day the Dao is performed, first burn the pre-notification talismans within the altar to summon the Nine Provinces’ community orders, the Three Realms’ divine officials, the Five Peaks and Nine Provinces, the Netherworld’s Northern Capital, the local city gods and mountain spirits, the River Deities and Yearly Lords, the Rain-Dispelling Dragon Gods, and their attendant officers and guardian spirits. All must assemble beneath the altar to cease the rain and secure clear skies, as per the proclamation. Then, encircle and ascend the altar, offering the White Chariot and White Horse Tablet, the Road-Opening Tablet, and petitioning the Five Emperors and Four Officials of the Celestial Bureau, the Three Celestial Star Palaces, the Heavenly Tribunal’s Three Halls, the Ten Celestial Treasures of the Soul’s Jewel, the Southern and Northern Dipper Palaces of the Four Extremes, the Four Sage Teachers’ Offices, the Three Officials’ domains, the Five Peaks’ Life-Decreeing Deities, the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Purple Forbidden Enclosure’s Upper Palace, the Fire Celestial Palace of the Red Sky, the Double Celestial Palace of Bright Clarity, the Five Palaces of the Han Officials of the Red Sky, the Five Elders of the Eastern and Western Celestial Peaks, the Celestial Sovereigns and True Persons, and those who intervene in the Law—all must be systematically invoked. Proclaim the True Symbols for Saving Suffering and the Supreme Most High’s Edict of Pardon for Ascension to Heaven.

Having done so, declare the Dao’s ritual penance and recite the True Scriptures. At dawn, conclude the rites; at noon, perform the Dao again, petitioning the Three Heavens with white tablets, the Nine Heavens’ Treasures, the True Symbol for Breaking the Underworld’s Seal, and offering the Tablet for Breaking the Black City’s Path, while chanting the Ten Kings’ Rites.

In the evening, perform the Dao once more, proclaiming the Rites of the Boy Saints for Saving Suffering and Ascension to Heaven.

At the first watch of the night, perform the Dao outside the altar, issuing summons and petitions to subdue spirits and guide them to the altar, welcoming the departed souls for purification. Offer the Tablet for Washing and Refining, proclaim the Rites of Washing and Refining, summon the spirits to the Three Treasures’ presence to receive the talismans and take the precepts, return the souls to their proper forms, and recite the Ten Prayers with food offerings.

Next, extinguish the Radiant Wheel Lamps and the Nine Cauldrons’ Divine Lamps, proclaim the Nine Abyss Rites, and let the Master break the prisons. Then summon the Nine Underworlds and Six Paths for purification, followed by the unrestricted night fast, instructing and admonishing the spirits until complete. Welcome the souls to view their reflections and manifest their forms.

At the midpoint of the night, ascend the altar to perform the Dao, offering the Tablet for the Departed’s Transfiguration and practicing the Nine Refining Transformations into Immortality. Proclaim the True Symbol for Extracting the Souls from the Netherworld, the True Symbol for Ascending to Immortality and Extending Life, and the Long-Life Talisman. Summon the couriers of the underworld, read the Contract of Mutual Agreement, and proclaim the Rites of Release.

Next, pray at the Fire God’s Court, where fish and dragons are separated, and burn the memorial scrolls for the Reeds, the Enclosures, the Gourds, the Dragons, and the Boy Saints.

When the fast is complete, purify the altar and hold the grand ritual. Invoke the Five Directions’ sacred diagrams, offer the Tablet of Thanks for Grace, request permission to return to the Mystic Master, present the Red Tablet of Merit and Thanks, and pray for official appointment. Conclude the fast.

Such are the prescribed rites; none may be omitted or altered. Whether the fast lasts seven, nine, or fourteen days and nights, each must be conducted with meticulous precision, neither rushed nor delayed. Even a three-day fast or a single day and night must follow the proper sequence—any deviation disrupts the ritual order, confounding the sacred laws and inviting ridicule from the Netherworld’s officials. The Three Officials will record your transgressions, the Four Bureaus will investigate, and though you perform the rites, your merits will yield but a fraction of their potential. Scholars must therefore adhere strictly to these precepts.

The Five Elders’ original conduct is recorded in the *Three Revelations of the Yellow Talisman*; even they, having avoided the Underworld, much less those who personally practice the Great Teachings and universally save the souls of the Netherworld. If the fast is completed ten times, the blessings extend to the heavens and earth, the ten directions and three realms—immortals, humans, ghosts, and even flying creatures and armored beings—all benefit from your virtue. The Demon Kings will respectfully recommend you, the Most High will rejoice, the Three Officials will declare your merits, the Five Emperors will record your name, the Patriarch will bestow the Imperial Flying Talisman, and the Golden Gate will descend with the Red Flower and Feathered Palanquin. The Seven Ancestors will be elevated from the Northern Palace, and the Nine Mystics will be removed from the Register of Death. Your mortal flesh will transmute into the Dao, your form into the divine, and you will ascend to the heights of the Three Heavens. Having swallowed the Golden Elixir and donned the Immortal Talisman, you shall ride in thousands of chariots and tens of thousands of horses, ascending in broad daylight. The Three Heavens will grant you rank according to your merits.

One may attain the rank of **Upper Clarity True Person**, or ascend as **Upper Clarity Sage Lord**, or become **Left Marshal of the Supreme Polarity**. Only then will one attain profound enlightenment and universally rescue all beings without distinction—such virtue is the fruit of one’s deeds.

You must strive earnestly, exhausting your resolve to practice accordingly.

**The Ritual of Settling Trust and Dignity**

The Classic says: Ancient worthies were pure and sincere, embracing the Dao and nurturing virtue, neither covetous nor desiring, self-sufficient in all things. With sincere intent alone, they could achieve resonance—no need for wealth or treasures, harmonizing with the primal and true.

In the degenerate age, people are deceitful and false, valuing wealth above life, discarding their own existence for profit, harboring innumerable evils within while outwardly consorting with malevolent forces, leading to their inevitable ruin without ever awakening.

Thus, I decree the dispersal of such greed.

First, internal calamities will not arise; second, external calamities will not manifest. With inner and outer tranquility, all sufferings will be dispelled. Therefore, to pledge sincerity, one must prioritize wealth.

If wealth can be relinquished, the heart will follow. The virtuous and enlightened communicate with the unseen—according to one’s intent.

The lofty heavens and vast earth, the Mysterious Sage and Supreme True Ones—none can be attained without trust, none can be moved without sincerity. The attainment of resonance lies in trust itself.

Thus it is said: Those who study the Dao, bearing gold and jade, pledge their hearts to the heavens.

**Thirteen Gold Dragons**
Ten for the Ten Directions, three to be cast as per the ritual.

**Ritual Specification:**
The Son of Heaven, Empress, and Crown Prince use **Superior Gold**.
Officials of the Three Ranks and below use **Middle Gold**.
Those of the Nine Ranks and above use **Secondary Gold**.
Commoners use silver overlaid with gold.
Each measures **three inches and six divisions** in length.

The Dragon is the celestial courier, transmitting messages to the heavens. The Dragon’s mission comes first.
Carrying the tablet, it ascends to convey trust to the Three Officials and secures the altar to communicate sincerity to the Ten Extremes.
The method of Settling Trust begins with the Dragon.

**Omissions:**
If omitted, it will be reviewed by the **Yin Officials’ Bureau**.

**Further, the Imperial Ritual for the Altar of the Ten Directions**
When constructing an altar for the **Ten Directions’ Celestial Worthy**, the **Five Sacred Mountains**, and the **Three Luminaries of the Water Realm**, adorn each with **embroidered silks of corresponding hues** and secure them with **jade discs and golden dragons**.
Additionally, inscribe the **Five Elders’ True Scriptures** on the **five directions**, displaying the **jade characters** openly, and solemnly pledge to all the **Heavenly Beings**, observing **threefold offerings** for mercy, repentance, and atonement.
Use **five sections of willow wood** and **square tiles** in the prescribed manner, binding them with **colorful silk** inscribed with the **Five Phases’ Qi** to secure them.
On the evening of the **Five Directions’ Altar Dissolution**, hang these at the **five directions**—thus, one may **ward off celestial calamities**, safeguard the **imperial mandate and cosmic cycles**, avert **poisonous harm**, and deliver the **myriad people**.
Then, **life and death depend upon it**, and the blessings are **inexhaustible**.

Use **five brushes**, **five inkstones**, **five tablets and inkstones**, **five sets of counting rods**, and **five hundred sheets of paper**, distributed across the **five directions**.
Divide **five stones of rice** as **luck rice** and **five thousand coins** as **life money** among the **five directions**.
Each paper is sealed and inscribed with:
- **Eastern Dipper** for calculating fate,
- **Southern Dipper** for granting life,
- **Western Dipper** for recording names,
- **Northern Dipper** for determining death,
- **Central Dipper** for recording virtues.

Further, carve **five wooden boy figures**, each holding a **zhi wood box** containing the **True Scriptures**, and burn them during the **Altar Dissolution Ritual**.
Alternatively, use **two stalks of teca grass** as **Dragon Banners**, with **two boy figures**—the left holding a long staff, the right grasping the **Dragon Cord**—to await the day of the **Altar Dissolution**, when they bind the **white tablet and command** with iron thread to the **Teca Dragons**.
Deploy the **two banners of Derivation and Return to Yellow** for the boy figures to carry.
The **Method** states: This is called **"Teca Dragon Carrying the Body"**—a **wind and fire relay transmission**.

Moreover, for those practicing the ritual, preserve the **light of the Three Pure Ones**, the **Three Luminaries**, and the **Three Days’ Light**, combining them with **True Fire** for refinement until the fire is exhausted.
The **transmitted light** ascends as **purple clouds**, and the **departed souls** ride upon its **qi**, attaining rebirth in the **Heavenly Realm**.
Next, the **Soul’s Treasure Officials** escort **soldiers and horses** with **two talismans**, accompanying the deceased to the **Celestial Gate**, where they verify identity and ascend to the **Dao’s Domain**.

**Imperial Ritual and Symbolic Array**
The **Method** states: The **Supreme Three Worthy Ones** dwell upon the **Mountain of Mysterious Capital, Jade Celestial City**, within the **Seven Treasures’ Mysterious Altar** and the **Purple Micro Palace of the Upper Celestial**.
The **Ten Directions’ Celestial Worthy** of the **uppermost world** descends **three times daily**, circling in attendance, holding **talismans and command scrolls**, bearing **banners and flags**, reciting **profound scriptures**, traversing the void with levitating steps, performing **music of the Celestial Hook**, scattering **divine flowers and marvelous sights**, with **luan birds dancing and phoenixes soaring**—thus, the **Three Realms rejoice**, and the **Ten Thousand True Ones celebrate**.
Now, the **ritual of the fast**—ascending the altar and offering prayers—**represents the Mysterious Capital, Jade Celestial City**.
The **imperial ritual’s methods and forms** are all complete.

The **Imperial Ritual** states: **Elemental Lord** expounds the **Soul’s Treasure Mysterious and Marvelous Method** of **transcending the first degree**, gathering all **celestial beings** at the **Platform of the Heavenly Treasure of the Void**. The **Heavenly Hosts** march in procession, with **sun, moon, and stars**, **celestial globes and jade balances**, **birds, beasts, luan, and phoenixes**, **crimson carriages and green banners**, **flag-draped standards**, all coming to pay homage to the **Worthy**.
Thus, those who perform the ritual, constructing the **altar’s steps**, follow the **Heavenly Methods** to deliver the **myriad people of the lower world**.

**One Pair of Banners**
Made of **five-colored silk**, with **five layers** above and below, suspended by a **golden staff** bearing a **luan phoenix beak** and **ribbon sash**.

**One Pair of Standards**
Covered with **pearl-draped nets** in an **eight-layered, angular design**, mounted on a **wooden staff**, with **dragon on the left and tiger on the right**, their **mouths clasping ribbon sashes**.

**One Pair of Flags**
Resembling **banners**, but without **dragon or phoenix mouths** holding the sash; instead, **three layers** of **five-colored silk** are suspended by a **staff**.

**One Pair of Jade-Pearl Banners**
Adorned with **pearl brocade and jade pendants**, the **golden phoenix mouth** holds them, suspended by a **staff**.

**One Pair of Five-Star Folding Fans**
Carved from wood and painted in **golden hues**, with **stars and constellations** on the upper half, **Five Sacred Mountains** in the middle, and **seas and marshes** on the lower half; mounted on a **crimson staff**.

**One Pair of Crane Feathers**
Carved from wood to resemble **crane wings**, mounted on a **crimson staff**.

The **Imperial Ritual** states: When ascending the altar and performing rites, it is **to substitute for Elemental Lord’s manifestation**.
First, **construct the symbolic array** to **command the Ten Thousand Heavenly Beings**.
Within the **four cardinal directions** of the altar, arrange the **stars, constellations, mountains, marshes, and earthly mandates**, erecting the **Five Phases’ Qi Gates**, each according to the **Great Method**, without negligence.

**Crowns, Robes, Swords, and Pendants for the Ranks**
The **Method** states: **Attire** is for **ritual distinction**.
Ascending the altar to pay homage to the **True Ones**, there must be no disorder—**scriptures and diagrams** must be complete, **official ranks and status** clearly marked, **command scrolls** properly arranged, **high and low** in accordance with **law and degree**, from the **Master of Orthodoxy** to the **Lecturer**, with **ceremonial propriety** as the **standard measure**.

**Master of Orthodoxy**
Wears a **dark crown**, **crimson robe**, and **yellow skirt**, with a **crimson apron**; adorned with **twenty-four strands of red-and-white jade pendants**; carries the **Sword of Beheading Evil**, **two feet four inches** long.

**Master of Purple Void**
Wears a **dark crown**, **yellow skirt**, **yellow robe**, and **yellow apron**; adorned with **twenty-eight strands of green-and-purple jade pendants**; carries the **Sword of Illuminating Yang Light**, **two feet eight inches** long, and also the **Sword of the Five Emperors’ Summoning Spirits**, with **bright jade pendants**.

**Master of Cavern Spirit**
Wears a **dark crown**, **yellow robe**, **green robe**, and **yellow apron**; adorned with **thirty-two strands of white jade pendants**; carries the **Sword of the Three Primordials of Great Unity**, **three feet** long, and also the **Sword of the Three Sovereigns and Great Unity**, with **green jade pendants**.

**Master of Cavern Mystery**
Wears a **peony-patterned crown**, **yellow robe**, **purple robe**, and **purple apron**; adorned with **thirty-two strands of luminous jade pendants**; carries the **Sword of the Eight Scenic Waves’ Soul-Dispelling**, **three feet six inches** long, and also the **Sword of the Five Emperors’ Awe and Spirit Commanding Evil**, with **plain white jade pendants**.

**Master of Cavern Truth**
Wears the **Crown of Primordial Beginning**, **green robe**, **purple apron**, and **purple apron**; with **green lining and outer layer**, adorned with **thirty-nine strands of jade and pearl embroidered pendants** and **embroidered shoes**; sits upon the **Soul-Dispelling Eight Scenic Waves’ Platform**, holding **jade tablets and jade scepter**; wields the **Soul-Dispelling Sword**, with **jade pendants and pearl tassels** hanging on either side; bears **front and back talismans for summoning spirits and true essence**, or wears the **Cloud-Nascent Robe of the Immortal**.

**Master of Great Cavern**
Wears the **Crown of Primordial Beginning**, **yellow robe**, **purple apron**, and **Five-Colored Cloud-Nascent Robe**; adorned with **swords and pendants**, as with the **Master of Cavern Truth**.

**Master of the Three Caverns**
Wears the **Crown of Primordial Beginning**, **yellow robe**, **purple apron**, and **Nine-Colored Cloud-Nascent Robe**; bears **no sword or pendant**.

As with the ranks of high and low above, all are **attired in the sacred Daoist robes** for **ascending the altar to commune with spirits and True Essence**.

**Baohai Clouds** say: The **sword** is for **banishing evil and restraining wrongdoing**, its **awe subduing demons and spirits**. The **pendant** governs **movement and stillness**, **advancement and retreat**, adhering to the **central measure of harmony**, each with its own **hierarchical distinctions**.

The **Great Celestial Truth’s Supreme Daoist Ritual** encompasses **ten thousand forms and myriad names**, infinite transformations—from **palaces and towers** to **condensing qi and solidifying clouds**, the illusory presence or absence of essence**, never fixed in place**. Sometimes it manifests as **floating halls and empty chambers**, shifting in voids. Sometimes as **golden gates and jade towers**, materializing in the empty space. Sometimes it **encompasses the cosmos**, or **shrinks into the minutest hairs**. Yet even in its **feathered robes and cloud-garments, misty attire and jade pendants, pearl banners and precious emblems, flying seals and crystal caps, crystal scepters and rainbow standards, phoenix-borne chariots and dragon-wheeled palanquins, sun-flags and moon-banners, crane-drawn carriages and twisted-horned steeds**, though it embodies the **divine transformations of the Way**, it still observes **graded distinctions in rank**.

Thus, the **sacred Daoist robes for communing with True Essence**, the **swords and pendants**, the **caps and garments**, are modeled on the **Supreme Truth above**, while **establishing ritual standards for mortals below**. If one **observes strict purity**, maintains **serene silence in a quiet chamber**, concentrates the **spirit and harmonizes the qi**, and **wanders in emptiness with a tranquil mind**, then in **secret communion with the Great Emperor** or **hidden reverence at the Mystic Gate**, without concern for **distinctions in attire**, one will naturally grasp the **essence of spiritual resonance**. High and low, all ranks, **will dissolve into unity**.

Such as when **teaching and transforming the people**, **expounding and upholding the Dao of purity**, each follows **proper stages and sequences**, perpetually **serving as eternal models**. In **paying homage to True Essence**, the **altars are filled with reverent devotees**.

Those who **profoundly uphold the Dao** follow these precepts, and they are the **grand splendor of the Mystic Gate**.

**Oath of the Sacred Transmission for the Daoist Adept**
The **Imperial Sage** says: The **Supreme Dao of the Lingbao** is the **root and origin of the Great Law**, the **hidden resonance and inner sounds of the Celestial Sovereigns**. It is **not something mortals below can perceive**.

One must **select and refine the worthy**, ensuring their **spirit and virtue are inwardly steadfast**, their **ritual bearing is solemn and dignified**, their **words and deeds are trustworthy**, their **compassion and mercy align with filial piety and loyalty**, their **conduct is disciplined and upright**, their **mind pure and straight**, their **aspirations directed toward the Mystic Sage**. Only such a person is **fit to practice and uphold the Supreme Dao**, to **save and guide beings across life and death**.

If their **words and deeds are flawed**, their **filial piety and loyalty are lacking**, their **mind and conduct are deceitful and crooked**, their **flattery and hypocrisy betray truth**, their **inner virtue is absent**, their **outer bearing is disordered**, then **shallow and vulgar folk**—how could they **ever move the divine and awaken the spirits of heaven and earth**?

One must **scrutinize the wise and foolish**, **distinguish the ranks of the immortal**, and then **solemnly receive the oath**, submitting a **formal declaration to the Three Heavens**, awaiting their **response**. Only then may one **select an auspicious day** and **confer the transmission according to the ritual**.

For **adepts who uphold the Dao**, after **half a decade of practice**, they may **grant salvation to five individuals**. After **one full decade**, they may **grant salvation to twelve**, but **no more thereafter**. Yet even this, the **Lingbao scriptures** are **not the full extent of the true law**.

If **nobles and ministers** desire to **save their nation and uphold the perilous**, to **preserve and secure the imperial lineage**, those who **receive this Great Law** must **offer one hundred twenty taels of gold**, **five-colored silk and brocade each thirty-six bolts**, **cinnabar and green silk each twelve taels**, **one hundred twenty shi of rice for assurance and prosperity**, **one hundred twenty thousand coins in gold**, and **thirty-six jin of oath-incense**.

If **common folk** desire to **save and guide beings across life and death**, to **ascend to the Mystic Ancestor**, they must **offer thirty-two taels of gold**, **five-colored silk and brocade each twelve bolts**, **cinnabar silk nine taels each**, **twelve shi of rice for assurance and prosperity**, **one hundred twelve thousand coins**, and **six jin of oath-incense**.

For **adepts who have attained the Dao through cultivation**, they must **offer nine taels of gold**, **one bolt of purple brocade**, **one tael of green silk**, **one tael of cinnabar**, **one jin of oath-incense**, and **one hundred sheets of ritual paper**, along with **one set of offerings from each of the five directions** in **money and rice**. Those **without means to practice the Dao** may **use two-thirds of these amounts**, but **nothing must be omitted**.

For this **law is secret even to the Supreme Heaven**, its **prohibitions are most grave**. Even **celestial beings and immortals** must **bring gold and treasures to the Upper Palace of the Mystic Gate** to **receive transmission**, hence **it cannot be casually revealed**.

If **adepts of the Dao** wish to **transmit the sacred law to those who uphold the ritual**, they must **diligently report each case to the Heavenly Tribunals**, following the **required offerings** as specified earlier. **No private concealment is permitted**.

If **transmission is withheld** due to **stinginess in lending worldly wealth**, or if **one spies and steals** to **acquire the offerings**, then **the adept is forbidden from granting salvation**. If **transmission is recklessly conferred**, the **Dao will not flourish**, the **spirit and virtue will not attend the scriptures**, and **demons will prevail**. Both **adept and disciple** will **suffer profound calamities**—this must be **strictly guarded against**.

If one **strictly follows the ritual precepts**, then the **Celestial Sovereigns will rejoice**, the **demons will submit**, and the **myriad spirits will pay homage**. At the **moment of opening the altar for transmission**, the **crowd of True Ones will oversee and guide**, bestowing upon us the **Dao and its law**. As the **Dao spreads and demons retreat**, **separation and union occur naturally**, **invoking the Sage and gathering the spirits**, **saving the living and guiding the dead**. Through **accumulated merit and steadfast practice**, the **fruition will be achieved in no time**.

**Inscription of the Sacred Tablet**
On the **year, month, day, and hour** of such-and-such, in the **state and county of such-and-such**, the **person of such-and-such** **hereby offers gold and treasures with a sincere heart**.

In accordance with the **ancient precepts of the Mystic Gate**, they **solemnly pledge to the Ten Heavens**. With **prostrations and reverent bows**, they **receive the Supreme Lingbao Daoist Scriptures**, the **hidden and profound texts of rank**.

Following the **ritual bearing**, they **practice the Dao**, **dissolving all inauspicious influences**, and **universally saving the boundless**. On the **day of receiving the Dao**, their **name is recorded in the Southern Palace**, where **myriad spirits stand guard**. Their **body transcends the Three Realms**, their **rank ascends to the Immortal Gathering**, while **demon kings bear witness** and **True Ones supervise**.

The disciple, **hereby humbly adheres to the Great Law**, **propagating the Divine and True**, **universally saving both Heaven and humankind**, daring not to conceal or transmit it lightly, **pledging by the Heaven-in-Heaven**.

After receiving the Law, the disciple dares not to divulge it carelessly to those below. Should they betray this oath, they shall be consigned to the **Ghostly Bureaus**, their lifespan diminished, their karmic tally reduced, enduring **ten thousand kalpas of trial**, forever sinking into the **Wheel of Rebirth**, and bringing calamity upon their **seven generations of ancestors**.

Today, a **deed of covenant** is hereby established as a solemn vow.

**Prayer for Transmission and Ordination**

*On the day of the month’s beginning in the year of the Great Age,*
The humble **Certain Person of [Place] lineage**, having purified with fasting and ablutions,
With utmost reverence and fear,
Prostrates twice and humbly submits this petition.

*This petitioner, having heard of the Profound Mystery’s teachings,*
Which open the **Dao/Way** of delivering the living and saving the dead,
*And the Sacred Treasury’s revealed texts,*
Which contain the wondrous **Logic/Principle** of shedding the mortal shell and ascending as a transcendent,
*Knows not to be a fortunate one born with such blessings,*
Nor one who casually stumbles upon such truths.
*To attain the ranks of the True Ones,*
One must rely upon a **Master/Teacher**.

*This petitioner seeks to:*
First, alleviate the sufferings of those who have passed,
Then, rescue the wronged souls trapped in the stagnant waters of existence,
So that even the lowest life may live without concern,
And all may preserve their bodies and escape calamity.
*Though I have once sworn,*
I have yet to meet a True Master.
*Now, I humbly encounter **Certain Master/Teacher**,*
Who does not conceal the **Mystic Passages**,
But opens wide the **Compassionate Dao/Way**,
And grants transmission to one such as I—
*Thus, I submit this earnest plea,*
And present gold and treasures to pledge my sincerity,
*Establishing a Sacred Altar*
And making my solemn appeal,
*To receive the Sacred Treasury’s Great Dao/Way’s secret teachings for refining and delivering souls,*
*And vow to uphold them from beginning to end,*
Never daring to forget the Master’s guidance.
*Should I ever breach this covenant,*
May I willingly sink into ruin.
*I pray for mercy,*
And hope the Master will grant me transmission,
So that my labors may bear fruit,
And I may join the ranks of the True Ones.

*Humbly, I submit this plea,*
And prostrate before the altar,
Awaiting the Master’s decree.
*This petitioner, with utmost reverence and fear,*
Prostrates twice and humbly submits this petition.

**Formula for Transmission and Ordination**

*The subject hears of the Primordial Ancestor of the Eons,*
Who transformed and gave birth to all the **Heavens**,
And concealed the **Song of the Azure Palace** within the void,
Yet spread the **Luster of the Purple Abyss** with vibrant splendor,
*Opening the three radiant lights,*
And nurturing all **Divine Beings/Spirits** with universal growth.
*By spreading the Five Scriptures,*
The **Heavens** are preserved within the cycles of the **Eons**.

*The Master sits upon the five-colored lion,*
And delivers the **Dao/Way** of salvation.
*Residing in the Seven Treasures’ cypress grove,*
He transmits the **Sutras** and entrusts them to the world.
*All the **Sages** bow in homage,*
And the **True Ones** attend in reverence to take refuge.
*These are the hidden melodies of the **Heavens**,*
Not the common songs of the mortal realm.
*The **Sacred Wind** carries the keys,*
And halts the sun and moon in their courses.
*The **Golden Mouth** expounds broadly,*
And stills the **Divine Wind** in its movements.
*With one recitation,*
All the **Heavens** acclaim its virtue.
*With ten repetitions,*
Even dried bones become living beings.
*Thus, it is known:*
The **Mystic Dao/Way** is unfathomable,
The **Profound Virtue/Power** is boundless—
*A treasure of the **Heavens** above,*
Not passed down to the world below.
*When encountered by a **Noble One**,*
With a **Red Heart** offering gold and treasures in pledge,
And receiving the **Heavens’** watchful transmission,
With all the **Sages** bowing in homage,
And the **Heavens** safeguarding the **True Doctrine’s** propagation,
While the **Demons’ King** upholds its **Dao/Way** as proof,
*Only then may one follow the **Profound Virtue/Power’s** essence,*
And be permitted to spread it further.

*Now, this successor-disciple of the **Dao/Way**,*
With accumulated blessings of past lives,
Encountering the **Sacred Wind**,
Pledges with heart and hands at the **Pure Court**,
And devotes **Sincere Intent** to the Great **Dao/Way**.
*Beating my head and cheeks,*
With prostrations and kneeling before the altar,
*I humbly follow the Formula of Transmission and Ordination,*
And abandon all attachments to worldly ties.
*Offering gold and treasures,*
And swearing with blood and elixir,
*I seek the Great **Dao/Way’s** support,*
And wish to join the ranks of the **Immortal Hosts**.

*The subject has early received the Master’s guidance,*
And been entrusted with the **Sacred Texts**,
*To originally refine and deliver beings,*
And meet **Noble Ones** without concealing the **Dao/Way**.
*Having accepted this earnest supplication,*
And reported it to the **Heavens** above,
*The subject has already received a blessed response,*
And now, on this auspicious day,
*Transmits the **Dao/Way’s** talisman and teachings,*
And receives the **Precepts** to command the **Hosts**.

*I pray that the Sacred Treasury’s **True Ones** and Profound Mystery’s **Heavenly Emperors***
May show compassion and deliver beings,
With **Convenient Means** and **Dao/Way** transmission,
*So that this disciple may:*
Surpass the dusty world,
Forever leave illusions,
Purify the **Six Senses** and attain **Calm Stillness**,
Escape the **Eight Difficulties**’ cycle of rebirth,
Awaken to the **Mystic Mechanisms**,
Walk the **Dao/Way’s** path of wonders,
Accumulate the **Three Thousand** merits of virtue,
And gather all **Immortal Hosts**.
*Subduing the **Five Emperors’** **Demon Kings**,
All **Spirits** tremble in awe.
*The subject, along with the successor-disciple,*
Humbly prostrates twice.

*Next, the disciple submits the petition and receives the **Sutra**.*

*According to the **Sutra**’s text:*
*Those who study and practice this **Sutra***
And penetrate its subtle mysteries,
Shall attain flight to the **Southern Palace**,
Avoid the **Hell Realms**,
And deliver all without limit—
*All **Heavenly Beings** and mortals rejoice in its blessings.*
*The boundless blessings of life and death,*
And the **Heavens’** grace—
*A treasure not passed down to the world below.*
*When a **Noble One** offers gold and treasures with sincerity,*
And pledges with the **Heavens** to transmit,
*Yet reveals the **Dao/Way** lightly or with arrogance,*
The curse extends to the **Nine Ancestors**,
And eternal servitude in the **Ghostly Offices**.
*With the **Five Emperors** and the **Sutras**,*
Twenty-four **Jade Boys** and **Jade Girls** attend,
Guarding the **Sacred Texts**,
And protecting those who receive the **Sutra**.
*After the invocation is complete,*
The disciple kneels to receive.
*Next, the **Dao/Way** is transmitted.*

The Sovereign hears that the Dao/Way functions naturally, its efficacy unchecked, its essence most wondrous, its transformations boundless in the formless.

With reverence, I behold the **Lingbao** Great Law, its golden script most profound.
It is the **Primordial Origin’s** mysterious subtlety, the **Most Refined’s** tranquil void.
Its depths are unfathomable, its mysteries inexhaustible—
Sealing the **Great Luo’s** golden celestial gates,
Descending the **Floating Azure’s** pearl-like edicts,
Where all heavens bow in awe, and ten thousand sages guard it.
Only those with inherent virtue may glimpse its profundity.

All know that the Dao/Way is proclaimed by humans, yet humans are established by the Dao/Way.
Now, this disciple, [name], with sincere devotion, prostrates and vows to receive the sacred keys.
First, I reveal the ten directions, pledge in the three realms,
Wishing to exhaust ultimate truth, embody the Dao/Way, and deliver others.
With reverence before the sacred presence, I receive and uphold the Great Law.
I humbly pray that the **Golden Gate’s** Most True One,
The **Jade Capital’s** Mysterious Elder,
May open the nine nights of auspice, pierce the eight dark abysses,
Dispatch the **Jade Girls** with flying scrolls,
Present the golden tablets for wide proclamation,
Command the **Golden Boys** to extol virtue,
Unfold the **Jade Registers** for transmission.

Thus may this disciple’s spirit and essence be purified, eternal qi preserved,
Free from suffering, radiant in body,
Guarded by the three realms, welcomed by the Five Emperors,
Honored by ten thousand spirits, named in heaven’s records,
Merits fulfilled, virtue complete—ascending to **Upper Clarity**.

After the invocation, the disciple bows to the ten directions, then thanks the teacher.
Next, the teacher holds the **elixir water** and sprinkles the disciple’s body:
The first sprinkle—**Three Pure Ones**’ supreme deliverance.
The second—**Ten Directions’** ultimate truth’s deliverance.
The third—**Three Realms’** myriad sages’ deliverance.

Next, the teacher holds the **ring token** and recites the incantation:
*"Heaven and Earth unite in trust, the ring token as oath.
Practice loyalty and filial piety, the heart pure and even.
With compassion and reverence, words straight and chaste.
Consistent to the end, the Dao/Way aligns with the divine.
Avoid flattery, lest greed and wrath arise.
Harm the body, corrupt virtue—the three realms will not obey.
Now divided is the ring token; its meaning is unbreakable as gold."*

Next, the ring token is given to the disciple, along with the **scrolls, talismans, seals, and certificates**.

The **Lingbao** scriptures are revered by ten thousand heavens.
Today’s reception of the transmission is followed by the three realms.
All heavenly records name you among the **Immortal Lords**.
The **Emperor of Saints** proclaims to the **Primordial Expanse**:
*"Measure all beings, let our Dao flourish."*

After the invocation, the disciple bows twice and retires.

**Transmission of Gratitude and Vows**

Before the cosmos was distinct, the void congealed into brilliance.
Auspicious clouds gathered in the heavens, forming the **Flying Mysteries** at the celestial pole.
Sacred winds played their melodies, **dharma-qi** radiant.
Thus the pattern was inscribed, hidden through countless kalpas.
From the **Primordial Origin’s** descent, each leaf was passed down.
Until the **Orthodox Unity’s** propagation, the lineage remained unbroken.
Now, to establish vows at the **Sacred Altar**,
And universally benefit the mortal world.

Severing malevolent roots, dispelling calamitous fate,
Convenient for aiding beings, without regard to direction.
From coarse to subtle, its depths are unfathomable.

I, unworthy, inherited past blessings, born among mortals,
Living in the age of prosperity, meeting the **Mysterious Subtle** at its zenith.
With a purified heart, I uphold the precepts, prostrate in sincerity.
I wish to unfold the **Treasure’s** teachings,
And advance to the **Immortal’s** ranks.
To govern my body and harmonize the world, I follow the received transmission.
To rescue the sick and aid the perilous, I dare not forget the sacred pledge.
Should I violate the **Mysterious Prohibitions**, I willingly await the **Nether Judgments**.

---
**Sacrificial Rites**

With reverence, I acknowledge that the **Hundred Demons** conceal their rhythms,
Their separations and unions governed by nature.
As the three luminaries shine, the **Great Procession’s** dharma-qi unfolds,
The **Supreme Great Luo’s** realm—
The **Primordial Origin’s** sovereign abides.
To transmit the Law and deliver beings, there is the subtle art of **returning form**.
To propagate the scriptures and benefit the world, there is the true function of **reviving the dead**.

Those who uphold the scriptures are guarded by the eight-directional mighty spirits.
Those who uphold the Law are protected by the heavenly sages above.
The **Five Emperors** and **Great Demons** are entrusted with it,
The **Ten Directions’** flying immortals bear it.

Now that the supreme teaching has been transmitted and pledged,
The **Demons’ King** acknowledges its efficacy.
Following the **Heavens’** prohibitions, I reveal the sacrificial rites at the **Sacred Altar**,
Summoning the ten directions, commanding the earthly spirits with the **Essential Decisions**.
Wielding heavenly authority, subduing demons and ghosts with the **True Scripts**.
When this scripture is recited, all heavens gather.
When its practice is subtle, ten thousand sages attend.
Those who assist the Law enter **Non-Existence into Existence** upon hearing the incantations.
Those who aid the Dao/Way, upon receiving the **Symbols and Commands**, depart death and enter life.

The **Eight威威** dragon scripts can safeguard against calamitous fate.
The **Red Scripts with Jade Characters** can avert disasters.
Mingling with the hundred spirits, the **Three Realms’** demon kings prostrate.
Harmonizing the five **qi**, the ten thousand true sovereigns submit.

Now, according to the ritual vows, I humbly present these offerings.
I pray that the **Lingbao** officials and **Law Officers**,
Receiving the solemn sacrificial offerings,
Enjoying the concentrated rites,
May exalt the teachings, assist the Dao’s functions,
Subdue below to protect the mortal form,
So that demons have no power to interfere.
Wielding the **Symbols**, grasping the **Talismans**,
Suppressing ghosts so they dare not act malevolently.
The divine overseers are present.
The sacrificial rites are now complete.

---
**First Offering**

With reverence, I acknowledge that the **Lingbao** original scripture
Is the boundless means of delivering beings.
The highest and most wondrous—
The root and source of the Great Law.
Sometimes transmitted in the human realm,
Sometimes hidden in the heavens.
Those who revere and uphold it receive blessings;
Those who reveal it lightly or with arrogance invite calamities.

I, [name], with past merit, now reverently participate in the Great Law.
Having received the transmission from the teacher,
I must perform the sacrificial rites to present the offerings.
I pray that the officials’ wisdom may discern these humble rites,
And that their august presence may, though distant, aid the **Mysterious Altar’s** rectitude.
The **Spiritual Constructs** are gracious, assisting the **Primordial Merit** in the **Lesser Manifestation**.

Though I am but a novice of low rank,
I have encountered the true teacher.
Though I rely on the Great Law to subdue demons,
I fully depend on the mighty spirits’ assistance—
Severing a thousand thousand heads of calamity,
Subduing ten thousand ten thousand forms of monsters.
Wielding the **Golden Axe’s** fierce slaughter,
Beheading the **Ghostly Heroes**.
Displaying the **Great Heavenly Empress’s** punishing might,
So that winds and fire do not cease.

The **First Offering**—
Some cross the **Underworld’s** depths, resolving ancient karmic debts.
Some are cured of chronic ills, regaining form in this very moment.
**Virtue** shines, and all share its glory;
**Merit** is complete, and all partake in its rewards—
Let none grow slack, lest prior efforts be undone.

Hear my words with reverence, and do not neglect them.

**The Second Offering**—
I humbly submit: organize the ranks, maintaining strict discipline in the encampment.
Array the banners and flags, and ensure the weapons are in order.
Proclaim the commands clearly, inspecting the **Ghostly Legions**.
Reward and punishment must be impartial, benefiting the **Five Sovereigns**.

When **ghostly monsters** are vanquished and plagues dare not spread,
The **Divine Ones** guard the gates, and all strange portents retreat to distant realms.
If the **Omen** follows its **Way**, then all are equal and upright.
If you assist the **Dao**, then you will be disciplined yet bold and loyal.

Together, accomplish the greatest of deeds,
To aid the **Uncarved Block’s** transformation.

Now, having presented our sincere prayers and offerings—
Libations poured thrice, unbroken in sincerity—
We rely entirely on the **Divine Ones’** discernment.
The **money and horses** offered shall be recorded as pledged;
Once the rites conclude, we pray for their return to their proper order.

**The Final Offering**—
Proclaim the **Divine Edict** and the **Sacred Decree**.

「With profound reverence, I retreat and bow twice.

Now, the **Sacred Talisman** shall be inscribed—
**Book of Talismans** and **Sacred Edict** proclaimed:
*"Om! Ye Zha Tu Ju He Le Zhan Ju Po Yi Zhi Di Sa Zha!"*

Pinching the middle finger, ten **Dao/Way** are written,
Distributed across the ten directions,
Each bound with yellow parchment and red paper,
And dissolved with a single gold coin per talisman.

**Dissolution Incantation** proclaimed:
*"Ten thousand harmonies merge, a hundred thousand coalesce,
Fusing all spirits divine.
The **Divine Sovereign** accepts the mandate,
Overseeing all celestial beings.
Demons kneel in submission, all spirits cowed—
Guard the truth and uphold life,
To deliver countless souls.
In death or life, their reliance is fixed;
Their blessings boundless.
No merit or fault unrecorded—
Preserve and elevate your essence.
Swiftly, as the **Lingbao Precepts** decree."*

**The Lingbao Supreme Method**—
*Only with the Heavenly Jade-Sealed Imperial Edict,
Can one penetrate the profound and obscure.
If mere mortal script is employed,
No more than what the True Master transmits,
Then labor is in vain, and no gain shall follow.
Moreover, the Lingbao Jade Seal—
In ancient times, the **Primordial Sovereign of the Dao** (元始天王) refined his **marvelous qi** (妙炁) into true seals,
All carved from **jade of emerald hue** (碧玉).
Named the **Golden Chapter, Jade-Sealed Edict** (金章玉重),
Descended upon the **Heaven of True Spirits** (真灵之天),
And entrusted to the **Dao Sovereign** (道君).
Later bestowed upon the **Celestial Sovereign of the Void** (虚皇天尊),
The **Celestial Sovereign of the Void** passed it to the **Imperial Sovereign of the Golden Gate** (金阙帝君),
The **Imperial Sovereign of the Golden Gate** conferred it upon the **Great Emperor of Heaven** (天皇大帝),
And the **Great Emperor of Heaven** first bestowed it upon **Xuanyuan** (轩辕).
Xuanyuan thereafter encountered the **Great Master of Mystic Dao** (玄中大法师) and the **Celestial Sovereign of Serenity** (静老天尊),
Each expounding their own scriptures, each with distinct classifications.
Xuanyuan earnestly sought their teachings,
Thus the Mystic Master instructed him in **method** (法) and **ritual procedure** (式).
Hence, the **Lingbao Supreme Method** is under the Mystic Master’s authority.
Since then, generation after generation has established rites,
Each **region** (方方) transmitting scriptures,
Yet without meeting the true adept,
The seals were often concealed in **Bright Mountains** (明山) and never revealed.
Later, when **Immortal Adepts** (神仙) emerged,
Encountering this sacred text,
The **Celestial Sovereigns** (天尊) in compassion,
Entrusted them with the seals,
Thus transmitting them to future ages.
Those who study it earnestly, as if meeting the adept,
Shall guard and cherish it,
Never lightly passing it to others,
Lest its power be squandered.
The **Highest True Ones** (高真) of the **Three Realms** (三界) who behold it,
Often mourn in sorrow, unwilling for its revelation.
To reveal it invites retribution and calamity—
Deeply lamentable.
Now inscribed in this scroll,
See it, revere it, and keep it secret—
This suffices.*
