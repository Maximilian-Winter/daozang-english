*The Zhonghe Collection*

**Title:** *Zhonghe Collection*. Composed by Li Daochun of the Yuan dynasty. Six juan. Based on the edition from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* section, Methods category.

**Preface to the *Zhonghe Collection***

Cai Zhiyi of Sun’an in Weiyang was a disciple of Master Yingchan, Li Qing’an. Having seen through the illusions of the mundane world, he devoted himself to cultivating the immortal Dao. Gathering the remnants of his master’s teachings—scattered fragrance and lingering essence—he compiled them into this work, titling it the *Zhonghe Collection*, after his master’s chamber of stillness.

In the autumn of the *bingwu* year of the *Dade* era, he sought my approval, wishing to commit it to print and awaken later generations. Before I had even opened the scroll, I already knew that all delusions would be swept away and the One True [Reality] would stand revealed.

It speaks of the Mandate bestowed by Heaven as life, received by humans as nature; of the Primordial Supreme Polarity, the spontaneous Golden Elixir, its radiance illuminating the Great Void—requiring no artificial refinement—all secrets laid bare without omission. Through this, one may fathom the numinous and comprehend transformation, deepening the root and stabilizing the ultimate; one may shed the mortal coil and attain spiritual transfiguration, returning to the Non-Ultimate.

Moreover, it reveals that the Dao is a thing of undifferentiated wholeness; that the Confucians’ “central harmony nurtures all things,” and the Buddhists’ “pointing to the mind to see nature,” though differing in method, all arise from the same Supreme Polarity. Thus, the ancient sages of Daoism were ever diligent in saving others; the Buddha did not slight even you; how could the Duke of Zhou deceive us?

Let those who read this collection guard against doubt.

Written by Du Daojian of Nangu on the *Dangtu* road at the *Xianyuan Zhen* Hall in Qiantang.

**Zhonghe Collection, Juan One**

Composed by Li Daochun, Yuan Su, the Pure Toad Master of Yingchan of Duliang.
Compiled by his disciple, Cai Zhiyi, the Precious Toad Master of Sun’an.

*The Mysterious Gate holds no fixed doctrine—*
*Movement and stillness arise without origin.*

The *Taiji* Diagram—Yin and Yang without Beginning

The Buddhists call it *Perfect Enlightenment*; the Daoists, the *Golden Elixir*; the Confucians, the *Supreme Polarity*. That which is called "the Ultimateless and yet the Supreme Polarity" means the ungraspable that is yet grasped.

The Buddhists say: *"Thusness unmoving, luminously ever-aware."*
The *Book of Changes* states: *"Still and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating."*
The *Elixir Scriptures* declare: *"When body and mind are unmoving, the true mechanism of the Ultimateless arises"*—this speaks of the wondrous essence of the Supreme Polarity.

Thus, the three teachings all esteem stillness and concentration. As Master Zhou said: *"Abide in stillness."* For when the human mind is still and undisturbed by external things, it is serene with Heavenly Principle—this is the wondrousness of the Supreme Polarity. Once stirred by external things, partiality and bias arise—this is the transformation of the Supreme Polarity. If, in moments of stillness and concentration, one guards what is preserved within, then Heavenly Principle remains ever luminous, the empty and numinous never obscured. When movement comes, there is naturally a master within, and all things that arise can be met with response.

When the work of stillness and concentration is fully refined, one arrives at this state not by striving but spontaneously. The true Ultimateless is restored, the wondrous responsiveness of the Supreme Polarity is illuminated, and the principles of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are all complete within oneself.

*The Diagram of Central Harmony and Uprightness*

The Unerring Manifestation
*The Record of Rites* states: "Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—before they are aroused is called *zhong* (the Mean); when aroused and all in due measure is called *he* (harmony)." Before arousal, in the stillness of concentration, one guards what is preserved within—hence it is called *zhong*. Preserved yet without form, it is thus called the great root of all under Heaven. When aroused and in due measure, in movement one guards what is expressed—hence it is called *he*. With every manifestation unerring, it is thus called the universal Dao of all under Heaven. If one can attain *zhong* and *he* within the body, then the original substance is empty yet numinous, still yet aware, and in motion upright. Thus one can respond to the endless transformations of all under Heaven.

*Laozi* said: "If one can constantly abide in clarity and stillness, Heaven and Earth all return." This is the same meaning as Zisi’s "attaining *zhong* and *he*, whereby Heaven and Earth take their proper places and the myriad things are nurtured." *Zhong* and *he*—these are the wondrous functions of resonance and response, the pivot of adaptation to change. *The Book of Changes* embodies the ceaseless flow of generation and nurturance, the totality of every movement and stillness.

Is it not fitting that I name my dwelling with the plaque "Central Harmony"?

*Yielding and Accord*
Body, mind, worldly affairs—these are the four conditions. All people in the world are entangled by them, yet only those who yield can respond. Constantly responding, constantly still—what entanglement remains?

What is yielding?
The body yields in tranquil stillness, the mind yields in luminous clarity, the world yields in harmonious unity, affairs yield in natural spontaneity.

What is accord?
Accord with Heaven’s mandate, accord with Heaven’s Dao, accord with Heaven’s seasons, accord with Heavenly Principle.

The body in accord with Heaven’s mandate can thus respond to others;
The mind in accord with Heaven’s Dao can thus respond to things;
The world in accord with Heaven’s seasons can thus respond to change;
Affairs in accord with Heavenly Principle can thus respond to opportunity.

Having mastered yielding and accord, and further mastered response, one is freed from the four conditions. Those who attain this insight abide in constant response and constant stillness, constant clarity and stillness.

*The Diagram of Illuminating Delusion*
An ancient saying goes: "Constantly extinguish the moving mind, not the illuminating mind." Every unmoving mind is the illuminating mind; every restless mind is the deluded mind. The illuminating mind is the mind of Dao; the deluded mind is the human mind. The mind of Dao is subtle, meaning it is profound and difficult to perceive. The human mind is perilous, meaning it is precarious and unstable. Though the human mind also contains the mind of Dao, and the mind of Dao also contains the human mind, this depends on the interplay of movement and stillness. Only those who sincerely hold fast to the Mean preserve the illuminating mind constantly, keep the deluded mind unmoving, transform peril into peace, and reveal the subtle in clarity. At this stage, the mind of delusion is restored, and the Dao of non-delusion is accomplished.

*The Book of Changes* says: "Return—is this not the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s mind?"

*Eulogy on the Diagram of the Supreme Polarity*
The central circle ○ represents the Ultimateless that is the Supreme Polarity. The Supreme Polarity moves and generates yang; when movement reaches its limit, it becomes still, and stillness generates yin. With the interplay of yin and yang, the Two Modes are established. ○ represents the Two Modes. ○ represents yang in motion. ○ represents yin in stillness. Yin and yang intermingle, generating the Four Images. ○: when the Four Images move and move again, it is called *old yang*; when movement reaches its limit and becomes still, it is called *young yin*; when stillness reaches its limit and moves again, it is called *young yang*; when stillness persists in stillness, it is called *old yin*. The Four Images in their movement and stillness generate the Eight Trigrams: *Qian* (☰) as one and *Dui* (☱) as two represent the movement and stillness of *old yang*; *Li* (☲) as three and *Zhen* (☳) as four represent the movement and stillness of *young yin*; *Gen* (☶) as five and *Kan* (☵) as six represent the movement and stillness of *young yang*; *Xun* (☴) as seven and *Kun* (☷) as eight represent the movement and stillness of *old yin*. Yin in reverse, yang in sequence, ascending and descending without cease, the mechanism unfolds to generate the sixty-four hexagrams—here the Dao of the myriad things is complete.

The upper circle ○ is the beginning of qi transformation. The lower circle ○ is the mother of form transformation. To know qi transformation but not form transformation is to fail in attaining vastness. To know form transformation but not qi transformation is to fail in attaining subtlety. Thus a eulogy is composed to verify this.

*Eulogy in Twenty-Five Stanzas*
The Dao is originally supremely empty, the supremely empty without form.
Exhausting the inexhaustible, beginning from the unbeginning.
The empty to its limit transforms into spirit, spirit’s changes generate qi.
Qi gathers to form shape, one divides into two.
Two then interact, interaction then brings pairing.
Yin and yang intermingle, *Qian* and *Kun* take their places.
Movement and stillness unceasing, the Four Images interconnect.
Vigorous and yielding propel each other, the Eight Trigrams are thus linked.
Revolving the Five Phases in constancy, establishing the four seasons to complete the year.
Pure harmony transforms into purity, providing origin and nurturance.
In Heaven it revolves the myriad images, on Earth it fosters the multitudes of beings.
Forms bequeath to forms, things conceive within things.
Transformation upon transformation, generation upon generation—how could there be an end?
All things under Heaven are born from being, being is born from non-being.
Being and non-being interweave, the hidden and manifest support each other.
Tracing to their origin, all the myriad existents are fundamentally rooted in qi.
Tracing to their end, all the myriad things ultimately transform in form.
Thus we know that the myriad things are fundamentally one in form and qi,
Form and qi are fundamentally one in spirit.
Spirit is fundamentally supremely empty, the Dao is fundamentally supremely non-being—*The Book of Changes* is within them.
Heaven takes its place above, Earth takes its place below.
Humans and things dwell in the center, naturally blending and transforming—qi is within them.
Heaven and Earth are the greatest of things, humans are the most numinous among things—Heaven and humans are one.
The cosmos is in one’s hands, the myriad transformations arise from one’s body—change is within them.
The ultimate of humans is to stand between Heaven and Earth and establish destiny,
To receive the empty and numinous and complete nature.
Establishing nature and establishing destiny—spirit is within them.
Destiny is tied to qi, nature is tied to spirit.
Concealing spirit in the mind, gathering qi in the body—the Dao is within them.
Form transforms and there is life, with life there is death.
Emerging from life and entering death—this is the constant of things.
Qi transforms and there is no life, with no life there is no death.
Non-life and non-death—this is the constant of spirit.
Form transformation embodies Earth, qi transformation images Heaven.

Form transformation arises from resonance, qi transformation is natural.
The enlightened and lofty scholar preserves both qi and spirit.
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally they attain the real.
The real within the real—profound and ever more profound.
From the formless arises form—this is called the Embryonic Immortal.
To cultivate this Dao, where does one begin?
Only in stillness, only in emptiness may the Embryonic Immortal be hoped for.
Emptiness means no obstruction, stillness means no desire.
When emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness is profound, one observes transformation and knows return.
In movement, abide by stillness; in reality, embrace emptiness.
These two principles require each other—spirit and Dao are together.
Dao is the master of spirit, spirit is the master of qi, qi is the master of form, form is the master of life.
Without life, form abides; form abiding, qi abides; qi abiding, then spirit abides; spirit abiding, there is no abiding—this is called the Abiding of No-Abidance.
Refining form with golden liquid, preserving spirit with jade talisman.
Form and spirit both wondrous, they unite with Dao in truth.
The treasure of destiny is congealed, the pearl of nature is luminous,
The primordial spirit is numinous, the Embryonic Immortal is achieved,
The Dao of emptiness and naturalness is complete.
Great indeed is spirit—is it not the root of all transformations?

**Hidden Meaning Before the Hexagrams – First on the Images**
The *Yi* can be changed, yet is not the constant *Yi*.
The image can be imaged, yet is not the Great Image.
The constant *Yi* is unchanging, the Great Image is imageless.
The constant *Yi* is the *Yi* before the hexagrams were drawn.
The changing *Yi* is the *Yi* after the hexagrams were drawn.
The constant *Yi* unchanging is the body of the Supreme Ultimate.
The *Yi* that can be changed is the origin of creation.
The Great Image is the beginning of movement and stillness.
The image that can be imaged is the mother of forms and names.
Abiding in quiescence through kalpas—this is the constant *Yi*.
Pervading antiquity without cease—this is the changing *Yi*.
Utterly empty and without form—this is the Great Image.
Manifesting according to circumstances—this is the image that can be imaged.
The so-called constant is that whose beginning cannot be fathomed, whose end cannot be measured,
That which endures through a thousand myriad ages, vast and solitary in its existence.
The so-called great is that which externally envelops Heaven and Earth, internally fills the cosmos,
Pervades the worlds as numerous as the grains of the Ganges, serene and perfectly complete.
The constant *Yi* unchanging can thus govern the endless changes under Heaven.
The Great Image imageless can thus give form to the endless affairs under Heaven.
The *Yi* and the images—are they not the origin of the Dao?

**Second on Constancy and Change**
The constant *Yi* does not change, the changing *Yi* is not constant.
Its constancy does not change, thus it can respond to change.
Its change is not constant, thus it can embody constancy.
Beginning and end unchanging—this is the constancy of the *Yi*.
Movement and stillness inconstant—this is the change of the *Yi*.
Standing alone without alteration—this is attaining constancy.
Circling without cease—this is penetrating change.
Without knowing constancy, one cannot penetrate change;
Without penetrating change, one cannot know constancy.
Constancy and change—are they not the origin of the *Yi*?

**Third on Substance and Function**
Constancy is the substance of the *Yi*.
Change is the function of the *Yi*.
Unchanging through past and present—this is the substance of the *Yi*.
Changing with the times—this is the function of the *Yi*.
Without thought, without action—this is the substance of the *Yi*.
With resonance, with response—this is the function of the *Yi*.
Knowing its function, one can fully realize its substance.
Preserving its substance, one can effectively employ its function.
The sage observes far and near, seeks distantly and proximately—thus attaining its substance.
The noble person advances virtue and cultivates work, acts and creates tools—thus following its function.
As for exhausting principle and fulfilling nature, delighting in Heaven and knowing destiny,
Cultivating the self and ordering the state, establishing laws and regulations—
There is nothing outside the *Yi*.
Fully realizing the substance of the *Yi* suffices to know constancy;
Effectively employing the function of the *Yi* suffices to penetrate change.

**Fourth on Movement and Stillness**
Hard and soft push and surge—this is the movement and stillness of the *Yi*.
Yin and yang ascend and descend—this is the movement and stillness of qi.
Odd and even intermingle and accumulate—this is the movement and stillness of the hexagrams.
Qi and form wax and wane—this is the movement and stillness of things.
Day and night, waking and sleeping—this is the movement and stillness of the body.
As for the body’s advance and retreat, the mind’s arising and ceasing,
The world’s opening and obstruction, affairs’ success and failure—
All are one movement and one stillness, mutually dependent and concealed.
Observing their movement and stillness, the changes of all affairs and the conditions of all things can be seen.
In stillness, there is preservation; in movement, there is discernment.
In stillness, there is a master; in movement, decisions can be made.
In stillness, there is stability; in movement, there is no misfortune.
Stillness is the foundation of movement, movement is the mechanism of stillness.
When movement and stillness do not lose their constancy, the Dao is luminous.

**Fifth on Flexion and Extension**
Heat departs, cold arrives—this is the flexion and extension of the year.
Sun departs, moon arrives—this is the flexion and extension of qi.
Past departs, present arrives—this is the flexion and extension of the world.
As for being and non-being mutually arising, difficulty and ease mutually completing,
Long and short mutually shaping, high and low mutually inclining—
All are the principle of flexion and extension.
Knowing the Dao of mutual resonance in flexion and extension,
One can exhaust the endless benefits under Heaven.

**Sixth on Waning and Waxing**
Waxing is the beginning of waning.
Waning is the end of waxing.
Waxing is the gathering of qi.
Waning is the dispersal of form.
Growing, nurturing, and maturing—this is called waxing.
Returning to the root and restoring destiny—this is called waning.
Originating and penetrating—this is the waxing of the *Yi*.
Beneficial and upright—this is the waning of the *Yi*.
Spring and summer—this is the waxing of the year.
Autumn and winter—this is the waning of the year.
Infancy and maturity—this is the waxing of the body.
Old age and death—this is the waning of the body.
Non-being and being—this is the waxing of things.
Being and non-being—this is the waning of things.
Waxing is the companion of life.
Waning is the companion of death.
Since the two qi first divided,
There has never been a principle of waning without waxing,
Nor has there been a thing that waxes without waning.
Those who penetrate and understand this illuminate principle to its utmost clarity.

**Seventh on Spirit and Mechanism**
That which abides within—this is spirit.
That which issues forth and hits the mark—this is mechanism.
Quiescent and unmoving—this is spirit.
Resonating and penetrating—this is mechanism.
Hidden and unfathomable—this is spirit.
Responsive and without fixed direction—this is mechanism.
Encompassed within the body—this is spirit.

**Expanding to the Myriad Things—this is mechanism.**
**Fortunes and misfortunes foretold—this is spirit.**
**Shifting and never abiding—this is mechanism.**
**Cultivating the four virtues and ceaselessly strengthening oneself—this resides in spirit.**
**Permeating the Three Powers and responding endlessly—this is the operation of mechanism.**

**Eighth on Wisdom and Action**
**Wisdom** is profound understanding of principle.
**Action** is vigorous practice of the Dao.
Profound understanding of principle is knowing without seeing.
Vigorous practice of the Dao is accomplishing without striving.
Not stepping beyond the door yet knowing all under heaven,
Not peering through the window yet perceiving the Way of heaven—
This is profound understanding.
Ceaselessly strengthening oneself, adapting to all circumstances—
This is vigorous action.
Knowing disorder before it arises,
Knowing danger before it emerges,
Knowing ruin before it befalls,
Knowing misfortune before it strikes—
This is profound understanding.
Abiding in the body yet not burdened by it,
Moving in the heart yet not enslaved by it,
Acting in the world yet not swayed by it,
Engaging in affairs yet not hindered by them—
This is vigorous action.
Those who profoundly understand principle can transform disorder into order,
Danger into safety,
Ruin into preservation,
Misfortune into fortune.
Those who vigorously practice the Dao can attain longevity for the body,
Profound tranquility for the heart,
Great peace for the world,
And grand accomplishment in affairs.
None but those of great wisdom and great action can reach this.

**Ninth on Discerning the Times**
Nothing surpasses recognizing the times for mastering change,
Nothing surpasses comprehending principle for recognizing the times,
Nothing surpasses emptiness and quiescence for illuminating principle.
Emptiness brings clarity,
Quiescence brings purity.
When purity and clarity reside in the person,
The heavenly principle shines forth.
The transformations of heaven can be seen in the *Yi*.
The trends of the world can be verified in its images.
The truth or falsity of things can be discerned in their forms.
That which clings to form cannot be without its counterpart.
That which manifests in color cannot be without distinction.
When heaven is about to bring rain, the *qi* must first steam.
When a mountain is about to collapse, its base must first crumble.
When a person is about to encounter profit or harm, their countenance must first change.
It is like the nest knowing the wind,
The burrow knowing the rain,
Hibernating creatures responding to the seasons,
Falling leaves heralding autumn.
Or like merchants placing pheasant tails on their boats and carriages
To forecast clear or rainy weather—
When the sky is usually clear, the tail stands upright;
When rain is coming, the tail droops.
Even insentient things behave thus,
How much more so for humans?
Those who fail to recognize the changes of the times
Have not yet illuminated principle.

**Tenth on Rectifying the Self**
For advancing virtue and cultivating endeavors,
Nothing surpasses rectifying the self.
Once the self is rectified, nothing remains unrectified.
All forms and names are not established without rectitude.
All affairs and events are not accomplished without rectitude.
In daily life, in planning and responding to others,
Nothing does not begin with the self.
All matters, principles, heads, and things
Also do not originate from anything other than the self.
Thus, the essentials of self-cultivation
Must take rectifying the self as their foundation.
Rectifying the self in dealing with others—others will also return to rectitude.
Rectifying the self in handling affairs—affairs will also return to rectitude.
Rectifying the self in responding to things—things will also return to rectitude.
Only the single rectification of all under heaven
Can penetrate the myriad changes of all under heaven.
Thus, rectifying the self is the great function of self-cultivation,
The ladder to sagehood.

**Eleventh on Practice**
Clearing the heart and releasing burdens,
Cutting off thoughts and forgetting emotions,
Reducing selfishness and restraining desires,
Preserving simplicity and embracing the uncarved—
This is the practice of the Dao of the *Yi*.
When the heart is clear and burdens are released,
One can fully comprehend principle.
When thoughts are cut off and emotions forgotten,
One can fully realize one’s nature.
When selfish desires are entirely extinguished,
One can attain the Dao.
When simplicity and purity are preserved,
One can know heaven.

**Twelfth on Stimulus and Response**
Quiescent yet penetrating,
Non-doing yet accomplishing,
Not seeing yet knowing—
This is the stimulus and response of the Dao of the *Yi*.
Quiescent yet penetrating—nothing is not penetrated.
Non-doing yet accomplishing—nothing is not accomplished.
Not seeing yet knowing—nothing is not known.
Moving and then penetrating is not true penetration.
Acting and then accomplishing is not true accomplishment.
Seeing and then knowing is not true knowledge.
These three fall far short of the Dao of stimulus and response.
Only by acting before things arise,
Responding before movement begins,
Perceiving before sprouts appear—
These three advancing together—
Can there be nothing that is not penetrated,
No affair that is not responded to,
No abiding that is not beneficial.
Those who fully realize this Dao—
Is it not Yanzi alone?

**Thirteenth on the Three Eases**
The Three Eases are:
First, the Ease of Heaven;
Second, the Ease of the Sage;
Third, the Ease of the Heart.
The Ease of Heaven is the principle of the *Yi*.
The Ease of the Sage is the images of the *Yi*.
The Ease of the Heart is the Dao of the *Yi*.
In observing the Ease of the Sage, the value lies in illuminating the images—
When images are illuminated, one enters sagehood.
In observing the Ease of Heaven, the value lies in exhaustively investigating principle—
When principle is exhausted, one knows heaven.
In observing the Ease of the Heart, the value lies in practicing the Dao—
When the Dao is practiced, one fully realizes the heart.
Without studying the Sage’s *Yi*, one cannot understand the Ease of Heaven;
Without understanding the Ease of Heaven, one cannot know the Ease of the Heart;
Without knowing the Ease of the Heart, one cannot master change.
Thus, the *Yi* is the book of mastering change.

**Fourteenth on Resolving Confusion**
The waxing and waning of *qi*,
The rising and falling of times,
The prosperity and adversity of cycles,
The openness and blockage of the world—
This is the Ease of Heaven.
The auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of hexagrams,
The gains and losses of lines,
The perilousness and easiness of judgments,
The correctness and obscurity of images—
This is the Ease of the Sage.
The success or failure of fate,
The advancement or retreat of the self,
The success or failure of the world,
The safety or peril of position—
This is the Ease of the Heart.
Deeply mastering the Ease of Heaven, one knows the trends of the times.
Deeply mastering the Ease of the Sage, one knows transformations.
Deeply mastering the Ease of the Heart, one knows nature and destiny.
Uniting the Ease of the Heart with the Ease of the Sage,
Matching the Ease of the Sage with the Ease of Heaven,
Comparing the Ease of Heaven with the Ease of the Heart,
And penetrating them as one—
This is called the consummate scholar.

**Fifteenth on Dispelling Doubts**
Change and movement have their times,
Safety and peril lie within oneself.
Fortune and misfortune, gain and loss—
All begin with the self.
Thus, those who master change are those who follow the times.
Those who follow the times—
Even in peril, they find safety.

Those who master change—
Even in chaos, they bring order.
Those who do not lose their grasp—
Even in adversity, they find prosperity.
Those who do not attend to their conduct—
Even in abundance, they remain benighted.
Those who dim their brilliance—
Dwell in *Ming Yi* yet suffer no harm.
Those who rely on their possessions—
Dwell in *Da You* yet surely meet with harm.
Those who can respond from afar—
Their scholars are discerning.
Those who are close yet uninvolved—
Their intent is perverse.
Those who are weakest yet prevail—
They have found their support.
Those who are firmest yet never err—
They possess the Dao/Way.
The use of *Yi*—
It aids in overcoming misfortune and resolving crises.
The vision of *Kui*—
It spares the wicked from resentment.
Those who do not value their virtue—
Nowhere can they find refuge.
Those who do not possess themselves—
Nowhere can they find profit.
Those who stand alone and rely on themselves—
Achieve no merit.
Those who fear and reflect—
Attain good fortune.
Those who benefit others—
Others benefit them.
Those who profit others—
Others profit them.
Those who are trustworthy to others—
Others trust them.
Those who show kindness to others—
Others show kindness to them.
Those who fear misfortune—
Meet no misfortune.
Those who fear calamity—
Meet no calamity.
Those who fear disaster—
Fortune surely arrives.
Those who disregard fortune—
Disaster surely arrives.
What I call "safety and peril lie within oneself"—
What further doubt remains?

**Sixteenth on Sagely Achievement**
What makes the sage a sage—
Is the use of *Yi* alone.
The use of *Yi* in achieving success—
Is emptiness and stillness alone.
Empty, then nothing is not contained.
Still, then nothing escapes notice.
Empty, then one can receive all things.
Still, then one can respond to all affairs.
Emptiness and stillness sustained—
Then numinous clarity arises.
Emptiness—
Is the image of Heaven.
Stillness—
Is the image of Earth.
"Ceaselessly striving to strengthen oneself"—
Is Heaven’s emptiness.
"Virtue thick, it bears all things"—
Is Earth’s stillness.
Boundless and vast—
Is Heaven’s emptiness.
Square and broad without limit—
Is Earth’s stillness.
The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth—
Is only emptiness, only stillness.
Emptiness and stillness within oneself—
Then Heaven and Earth are within oneself.
The *Daoist Canon* says: "If one can constantly remain pure and still, Heaven and Earth all return to them."
Is this not what it means?
Purity is emptiness.
Emptiness and stillness—
Are they not the numinous power and sagely achievement?

*Exposition on the Diagrams of the Golden Elixir*

The four diagrams on the left reveal the profound and mysterious principles of the Supreme Dao/Way.

**Setting the Crucible**
A pillar propping heaven, supporting earth—so vast and dim,
Who names it the Jade Crucible?
Once refined within this vessel,
Emergence and return are all its domain.

**Erecting the Cauldron**
Neither existent nor non-existent, not centered between,
Externally void, internally hollow.
A resolute man overturns it to see—
There, that which was always crimson from the beginning.

**Returning the Elixir**
Beyond the roar of thunder, originally luminous,
Obscured only by clinging to illusory form.
If drawn forth from within the elixir,
Perfectly round, utterly void, numinously radiant.

**Reverting to the Root**
The Dao/Way is fundamentally non-action, the Dharma natural,
The sage establishes images, borrowing names as circles.
In ordinary daily use, it is fully manifest—
Shatter the vessel, and you know the image precedes the Lord.

**Diagram and Secrets of the Two Medicines**

*Extracting*
The central stroke is drawn out, replenishing—
Returning to Qian, the Creative.
The pure yang life-root is firm,
The unobstructed nature-pearl is whole.

*Responding to contact, it fully embodies Heavenly Principle,*
*Detached from dust, it unites with supreme dhyāna.*

*Gathering Lead*
Know where to begin—
The threefold dance of the embryonic immortal.

*Oral Secrets*

**Outer Medicine Diagram**
**Inner Medicine Diagram**

**Exposition on the Diagrams of Outer and Inner Medicines of the Golden Elixir**

Outer medicine can cure illness and bestow longevity. Inner medicine can transcend the mundane and enter the formless from the formed. Generally, those who study the Dao must begin with outer medicine before naturally grasping inner medicine. The most exalted adepts, having long cultivated the root of virtue, are born with this knowledge—thus, they refine inner medicine without first refining outer medicine.

Inner medicine is non-action yet all-accomplishing; outer medicine is action with deliberate purpose. Inner medicine is formless and insubstantial yet truly existent; outer medicine has form and function yet is ultimately empty. Outer medicine pertains to the corporeal body; inner medicine pertains to the Dharma-body. Outer medicine is the Way of earthly immortals; inner medicine is the Way of water immortals. The perfection of both medicines is the Way of celestial immortals.

Outer medicine completes destiny; inner medicine completes nature. The perfection of both medicines unites form and spirit in wondrous harmony.

**Outer Medicine**
- *First Pass*: Refining essence into qi—first, one must recognize *tiankui* (heavenly water) and swiftly gather it when it arises.
- *Middle Pass*: Refining qi into spirit—harmonizing true breath, circulating through the six voids, reversing the flow from the *Taixuan* Pass to the *Tiangu* Cavity for union, then descending to the Yellow Chamber, entering the Central Palace. When *Qian* and *Kun* unite in *Gou*, a single drop falls into the Yellow Court.
- *Upper Pass*: Refining spirit to return to emptiness—using the mind to refine thoughts is called the *Seven Returns*; emotions returning to nature is called the *Nine Returns*. Returning to nature is the *Nine Returns*.

**Inner Medicine**
Inner medicine is the essence of refining spirit—uniting form and spirit in wondrous harmony to merge with the Dao. Inner medicine is the primordial, singular true yang, like the central line in the *Qian* hexagram, which, when united with *Kun*, becomes the *Kan* Water. This central line is originally *Qian* metal, also called "metal within water," collectively named *zhi jing* (supreme essence). When this supreme essence solidifies, it reverts to the ancestral qi—the primordial, formless, true unity of original qi, not the qi of breath. As the central line of *Qian* unites with *Kun* to form *Kan*, the central yin of *Kun* enters *Qian* to form *Li*. The central yin of *Li* is originally *Kun* earth, hence called "mercury within cinnabar."

The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two gives birth to the Three; the Three gives birth to the myriad things.
Emptiness transforms into spirit; spirit transforms into qi; qi transforms into essence; essence transforms into form.
The above is called the *sequential* process.

Things contain the Three; the Three return to the Two; the Two return to the One.
Myriad refinements perfect the supreme essence; essence transforms into qi; qi transforms into spirit.
The above is called the *reversal* process.
The *Scripture of the Elixir* states: "Following the sequence, one becomes human; reversing it, one becomes the Elixir."

The three treasures—essence, qi, and spirit—are one in substance but two in function. What is substance? The great matter of the original Three Primes. What is function? The dual operations of inner and outer medicines.

**Inner Medicine**
Primordial supreme essence, formless empty qi, indestructible original spirit.

**Outer Medicine**
Interactive essence, breath of inhalation and exhalation, contemplative spirit.

- *First Refinement*: Essence transforms into qi—*First Pass*—deliberate action—extracting from *Kan* to fill *Li*.
- *Second Refinement*: Qi transforms into spirit—*Middle Pass*—union of being and non-being—*Qian* and *Kun* opening and closing.
- *Third Refinement*: Spirit returns to emptiness—*Upper Pass*—non-action.

These three stages of practice, when mastered, become one. If one possesses the single eye to perceive this, the great matters of the Three Teachings are complete. Should this not yet be so, study the following details carefully.

**First Refinement: Essence Transforms into Qi**
Returning to the Dao, one seeks the mysterious in the Water Palace.
The *Elixir Scriptures* state: *"When *gui* arises, swiftly gather it—gazing afar, it cannot be tasted."*
What is meant by "gathering"? It is the gathering that is no-gathering, called gathering.
If one truly gathers something, how can the single line within *Kan* ascend?
Essence is the transformation of the primordial supreme numen; through movement, the body comes to be.
The supreme essence within the body is original yang—this is what one gathers.
For example, *Qian* is the primordial supreme numen; at its first movement, it joins with *Kun* to form *Kan*, which is the image of the supreme numen transforming into original essence.
*Kan* is Water, and the single line within *Kan* is the original *Qian* Metal, provisionally called "Metal within Water."
Metal is the mother of Water, yet it resides within Water—thus it is said, "the mother conceals the child’s embryo."
The subtle signs of gathering Lead cannot be described in words.
Those who understand may observe the thunder within the earth, the return of the former kings, the closing of passes at the solstice when merchants and travelers cease, and the saying *"the latter does not consider direction"*—pondering these, one grasps more than half. The rest remains oral transmission.

**Second Refinement: Qi Transforms into Spirit**
In the tradition of Śākya, this is cultivating samādhi in the *Li* Palace.
The *Elixir Scriptures* state: *"True Earth restrains True Lead; True Lead restrains True Mercury. Lead and Mercury return to the Earth Cauldron—body and mind motionless, undisturbed."*
These words say all.
Once True Lead is obtained, what concern remains for True Mercury?
The essence of refining qi lies in movement: opening and closing, going and coming, ascending and descending—without cease.
At first, one employs intention; later, it becomes natural.
Each inhalation and exhalation seizes a year’s creative power.
This is what the *Daodejing* means by: *"The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Subtle and continuous, it seems to endure; its use is inexhaustible."*
Those who understand may focus on the gate of *Qian* and *Kun* in the *Book of Changes*, and within *Fu* and *Gou*—here lies the essence of refining qi.

**Third Refinement: Spirit Returns to Emptiness**
At this stage of practice, not a single word is needed.
The *Compass of the Three and Five* and the verses of Immortal Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* state:
*"Three, five, and one—just these three characters;
Through the ages, those who truly understand are rare.
East’s three and South’s two together make five;
North’s one and West’s four share the same.
*Wu* and *Ji* return to the generative number five;
The three families meet to form the infant.
The infant is one, containing true qi;
Ten months’ gestation completes the foundation of sagehood."*
These fifty-six words encompass all the Hundred Schools, the *Elixir Scriptures*, and the books of the Daoist canon.
If one possesses the single eye to perceive this, the work of study is complete. Should this not yet be so, consider the annotations below.

*"Three, five, and one—just these three characters"*: the Three Primes and Five Phases as one qi.
*"Through the ages, those who truly understand are rare"*: from antiquity to the present, few have known.
*"East’s three and South’s two together make five"*: East’s three is Wood; South’s two is Fire. Wood generates Fire, Wood being Fire’s mother—two natures of one family, thus "together make five."
*"North’s one and West’s four share the same"*: North’s one is Water; West’s four is Metal. Metal generates Water, Metal being Water’s mother—two natures of one family, thus "share the same."
*"Wu and Ji return to the generative number five"*: the generative number of Earth is five. Five stands at the center without a pair, naturally forming one family.
*"The three families meet"*: the Three Primes and Five Phases merge into one.
Thus it is said, *"The three families meet to form the infant."*
The so-called infant is a provisional name for the meaning of pure unity—hence, *"the infant is one, containing true qi."*
*"Ten months’ gestation completes the foundation of sagehood"*: three hundred days of gestation, refining the two medicines of eight ounces—cooking, refining, completing, maturing—this is the great work of transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood.
Thus it is said, *"completes the foundation of sagehood."*
This is spoken in terms of the individual body.

The East is Three, Wood—my nature.
The West is Four, Metal—my emotions.
The South is Two, Fire—my spirit.
The North is One, Water—my essence.

Nature is the master of the heart; the heart is the abode of spirit.
Nature and spirit are both bound to the heart—East Three and South Two together make Five.
Essence is the master of the body; the body is the bond of emotions.
Essence and emotions are both bound to the body—North One and West Four share as one.

Wu-ji, the central Earth, is the mind.
The Four Images and Five Phases are governed by the mind.
The mind has no counterpart—it is naturally one family.

For the practitioner of refinement:
Gathering body, heart, and mind naturally merges the Three Primes and Five Phases into one.
As the *Alchemical Writings* say: *"Gathering body and heart is the harvesting of medicine."*
This is precisely what is meant.

The essential method for gathering body and heart lies in emptiness and stillness.
Empty the heart, and spirit unites with nature.
Still the body, and essence and emotions become quiescent.
When the mind is profoundly settled, the Three Primes merge as one.
This is what is called *"the three flowers gather, the five qi ascend, the sacred embryo congeals."*

When emotions harmonize with nature, it is called *"Metal and Wood unite."*
When essence merges with spirit, it is called *"Water and Fire commingle."*
When the mind is profoundly settled, it is called *"the Five Phases complete."*

As the *Alchemical Writings* say:
*"Refining essence into qi is the first barrier—where the body does not move.*
*Refining qi into spirit is the middle barrier—where the heart does not move.*
*Refining spirit into emptiness is the highest barrier—where the mind does not move."*

When the heart does not move, East Three and South Two together make Five.
When the body does not move, North One and West Four share as one.
When the mind does not move, Wu-ji returns to the generative number Five.
When body, heart, and mind unite, the three families meet to form the infant.

One who achieves this has fulfilled the work of the Golden Elixir.
The great task of the immortals is complete.

As for the *Alchemical Writings’* various symbolic forms and diverse names,
none lie outside body, heart, and mind.
Yet for those who cannot immediately grasp the meaning,
I have set forth alternative names, symbolic forms, and diagrams below—
let those with discerning eyes examine them closely.

Body, heart, and mind are called the Three Families.
Essence, qi, and spirit are called the Three Primes.
Essence, spirit, soul, corporeal soul, and mind are called the Five Qi.
Lead, mercury, silver, cinnabar, and earth are called the Five Phases.
The meeting of the Three Families is called *"the embryo’s perfection."*
The union of the Three Primes is called *"the Elixir’s completion."*

*A Single Aperture of the Mysterious Pass—For My Disciples.*

The Mysterious Pass—a single aperture—is the most profound and essential mechanism. It is not the glabella, nor the fontanel, nor the navel, nor the bladder, nor the two kidneys, nor the space before the kidneys and behind the navel, nor the midpoint between the two kidneys. From the crown of the head to the heels of the feet, throughout the four great elements of the body, if one clings to any single location, one has already missed it. Yet one cannot depart from this body to seek it externally. Thus, the sages have simply pointed to the character *"middle"* to reveal it—this *"middle"* is precisely it.

Let me offer a metaphor to make this easier to grasp. Consider a marionette: its hands and feet move, its hundred gestures shift—yet the marionette does not move itself; it is the strings that pull it. Though the strings are the mechanism, it is the puppeteer who controls them. Ah! Do you recognize this puppeteer? Cease your doubts, and I will tell you plainly: the marionette is this body; the strings are the Mysterious Pass; the puppeteer is the Master Within. The body’s hands and feet do not move of their own accord—it is the Mysterious Pass that sets them in motion. Yet though the Mysterious Pass moves, it is the Master Within who commands it. If you can recognize this moving mechanism, how could you fail to attain immortality?

**Touchstone of Truth**

The Golden Elixir takes emptiness as its essence and clarity as its function—it is the supreme, most authentic, and wondrous Dao. Few in the world know it; fewer still practice it. Thus, the sages, in their compassionate power, opened the gate of skillful means, established names and forms, and inscribed them in the alchemical texts to guide later learners. Their intent was that those who come after might recite the words, illuminate the principles, silently comprehend the subtle currents, and thereby practice to swiftly ascend to the true realm. Yet later learners, failing to fathom these principles, cling to mere expedients, recklessly invoking a hundred interpretations, splintering the teachings into myriad fragments. They shatter the great Dao into crooked paths and side trails—three thousand six hundred in all—truly losing the transmission in the process.

Moreover, today’s ignorant and shallow scholars recklessly annotate the sages’ scriptures, introducing even greater distortions. How can they not mislead those who come after? Even those of earnest aspiration cannot discern truth from falsehood—how pitiful this is! For this reason, I have composed this *Touchstone of Truth* to distinguish the genuine from the spurious, that all learners may avoid confusion, resolve all doubt, and directly transcend to the shore of the Dao.

The sagely master said:
*"Three thousand six hundred gates of Dao and method—*
*Each clings to one as their root.*
*Who knows this subtle and mysterious point?*
*It lies beyond the three thousand six hundred gates."*

I say: the ancestral masters, with the urgency of an old woman’s heart, composed such verses. If there are still those who hold such views, the entire earth would turn to gold. If not, one must test it for oneself.

Thus, it is written:
**Nine Grades**

**The Three Gradual Methods and the Three Vehicles**

The Three Gradual Methods comprise the Three Vehicles. The Supreme Vehicle is the peerless, most true, and wondrous Dao. The Nine Grades of Heterodox Practices are as follows:

**Lower Three Grades**
The lowest of the lower grades includes: "controlling women" in the bedchamber, the Three Peaks and battle tactics, consuming breast milk before the furnace, using women as crucibles, menstrual blood as medicine, the birth canal as the place of bodily generation, and essence-blood as the great elixir’s foundation. Forging yin-yang swords, establishing the yin-intestine furnace, claiming women to be pure yang, and pointing to menstrual blood as the supreme treasure—ingesting it to achieve monthly restoration, employing nine women as nine crucibles, and pursuing nine years of ninefold refinement. Commanding boys and girls to copulate to gather their initial essence, extracting millet-like grains from the yin as the mysterious pearl. Then there are the "golden flower," the "golden spear," the seventy-two schools of fierce battle and victory, "more in, less out," and "nine shallow, one deep." Such perverse absurdities are called the "mud-water elixir methods," numbering over three hundred. These are the most chaotic of paths, the lowest of the lower grades—utterly heterodox.

Further, there are eighty-four methods of "joining," thirty-six kinds of "yin extraction," using the placenta as the "purple river chariot," refining urine into "autumn stone," consuming one’s own essence for "returning to the origin," and pinching the coccyx to "seal the pass." Husband and wife copulate without emission, claiming it as "non-leakage." Extracting women’s menstrual blood to make "red pills," or refining the five metals and eight minerals into pellets for women to ingest, producing flesh-masses after ten months as the supreme medicine—consuming these. Such false arts, too numerous to list entirely, number over three hundred and belong to the middle of the lower grades—external heterodoxy.

Then there are the various grades of elixir furnaces and fires, heating the five metals and eight minerals, manipulating mercury with lead, "pointing to the thatch" and "burning the mountain," stirring ashes and tending flames. As for external medicines like "spirit cinnabar," the "three submissions" and "five counterfeits," and the methods of ingesting metals, minerals, herbs, and woods—over four hundred in total—these belong to the highest of the lower grades, yet remain external heterodoxy.

The lower three grades together comprise over a thousand methods, practiced by those greedy for lust and profit.

**Middle Three Grades**
The lowest of the middle grades includes: fasting to avoid grain, enduring cold and consuming filth, ingesting pepper and wood, sunning the back and lying on ice, observing daily fasts, or adopting peculiar diets—some as "pure fasts," others with bizarre foods, drinking without intoxication as proof, reducing food for "withdrawal and replenishment," avoiding the five flavors for the "three whites," or eschewing cooked food entirely. Some drink wine and eat meat without harming life, calling it "non-action," or perform outlandish feats like "overturning seas." These belong to the lowest of the middle grades.

Swallowing mist and absorbing qi, gathering the essence of the sun and moon, ingesting the light of stars and the qi of the five directions, or drawing the qi of water and fire. Some engage in visualization and contemplation, roaming the nine provinces as practice, or imagine the two qi within the body transforming into a man and woman, mimicking human coupling for harmony. All such visualizations and vain methods belong to the middle of the middle grades.

Transmitting the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, reciting and practicing scriptures, propagating faith to seek karmic rewards, undertaking pilgrimages, pursuing the "ten faiths" of emptiness, the "three intervals" and "nine connections," worshipping stars and bowing to the Dipper. Some maintain silence, perform labor, or uphold external disciplines. All these are "with effort" and belong to the highest of the middle grades, gradually approaching the Dao.

The middle three grades together number over a thousand methods. Practiced diligently, they lead to gradual improvement, surpassing those who merely dabble.

**Upper Three Grades**
The lowest of the upper grades includes: stabilizing observation and inspecting form, visualization and breath regulation, rubbing and adjusting. The "Eight Brocades," the "Six Healing Sounds," gazing at the crown, guarding the navel’s root, swallowing saliva, stirring divine water. Some chew wood a thousand times to enliven, or point to the tongue as the "crimson dragon," rubbing the body to generate heat as "fire timing," or exhaling once and massaging nine times to seek longevity. Some refine thick saliva into the "true seed," guard the elixir field, or lift the external kidneys. Even "boiling the sea" and observing the nose, using saliva, essence, and spittle as medicine—these belong to the lowest of the upper grades.

Holding breath and circulating qi, bending and stretching to guide, massaging the waist and kidneys, guarding the glabella, moving the eyes, swaying the spine, and revolving the navel wheel. Some take the eyes as the sun and moon, the space between the brows as the "mysterious pass," or knock teeth as the "heavenly gate." Some imagine the primordial spirit exiting and entering the crown, dream of wandering immortal realms, silently pay homage to the Emperor Above, mistake drowsiness for "entering samadhi," count breaths as "fire timing," or visualize the heart and kidneys as black and white qi merging for "completion." These belong to the middle of the upper grades.

Refining essence and circulating qi, gathering the three fires to the navel, harmonizing the five viscera, the sixteen visualization methods, securing the elixir field, ingesting the "central yellow qi," returning the three fields, replenishing the brain and restoring essence, lifting the "golden well" twice, the "double passes" of the spine, grasping firmly and inward gazing—various refinements and circulations belong to the highest of the upper grades.

The upper three grades together number over a thousand methods. Practiced by those of middling capacity, they may also prevent illness.

**The Three Gradual Methods and the Three Vehicles**
The Lower Vehicle takes the body and mind as the crucible and furnace, essence and qi as the medicinal ingredients, the heart and kidneys as water and fire, the five viscera as the five phases, the liver and lungs as the dragon and tiger, and essence as the true seed. The years, months, days, and hours serve as the fire timing, swallowing saliva for irrigation as "bathing," the mouth and nose as the "three essentials," the space before the kidneys and behind the navel as the "mysterious pass," and the fusion of the five phases as the "elixir’s completion." This is the method of ease and joy, comprising over a hundred practices. If one can forget passion, it may also nourish life. Though similar to the upper three grades, its applications differ.

The Middle Vehicle takes heaven and earth as the crucible and vessel, kan and li as water and fire, the crow and hare as the medicinal ingredients, spirit, essence, soul, and intention as the five phases, body and mind as the dragon and tiger, and qi as the true seed. The cold and heat of a year serve as the fire timing, dharma-water for irrigation as "bathing," the inner realm not leaking outward and the outer realm not entering as "sealing," the "great abyss," "crimson palace," and "essence chamber" as the "three essentials," the "mud pill" as the "mysterious pass," and the fusion of spirit and essence as the "elixir’s completion."

This Middle Vehicle method of life-nourishment comprises several dozen practices, largely similar to the Lower Vehicle with minor differences. If practiced without negligence, it may also lead to longevity and enduring vision.

The Upper Vehicle takes heaven and earth as the crucible and furnace, the sun and moon as water and fire, yin and yang as the mechanism of transformation, lead, mercury, silver, cinnabar, and earth as the five phases, nature and emotions as the dragon and tiger, and thought as the true seed. Refining thought with the heart serves as the fire timing, stilling thought as nurturing the fire, containing light as sealing, subduing inner demons as field combat, body, mind, and intention as the three essentials, the celestial heart as the mysterious pass, emotions returning to nature as the elixir’s completion, and harmonious qi steaming as bathing. This is the Upper Vehicle’s path of life extension, similar in form to the Middle Vehicle but differing in application, comprising over a dozen practices. If a superior practitioner cultivates it with unwavering consistency, they may attain the Dao of immortality.

The Supreme Vehicle—The Supreme Vehicle is the peerless, most authentic, and wondrous Dao. It takes the Great Void as the crucible, the Supreme Ultimate as the furnace, purity and stillness as the elixir’s foundation, non-action as the elixir’s mother, nature and life as lead and mercury, and concentration and wisdom as water and fire. Curbing desire and restraining anger serve as the union of water and fire, the unity of nature and emotions as the convergence of metal and wood, purifying the heart and cleansing thoughts as bathing, preserving sincerity and stabilizing intention as sealing, precepts, concentration, and wisdom as the three essentials, the center as the mysterious pass, illuminating the heart as verification, perceiving nature as coagulation, the fusion of the three origins as the sacred embryo, the merging of nature and life into one as the elixir’s completion, the body beyond the body as rebirth, and shattering emptiness as attainment. This is the wondrous essence of the Supreme Vehicle, which the most accomplished practitioners may cultivate. When merit is fulfilled and virtue perfected, they directly transcend to the perfect and sudden, achieving sublime form and spirit, uniting with the true Dao.

*End of Volume Two of the Zhonghe Collection*
*Volume Three of the Zhonghe Collection*

**By Li Daochun Yuan-su of Dulian Qing’an Yingchan, Compiled by Disciple Sun’an Baochan Cai Zhiyi**

**Dialogue Records**

**Jie’an Qiongchan Zi Cheng Andao asked about the Dao of the Three Teachings as One**

Yingchan Zi was in quiet sitting within the Toad Grotto. That night, the cold light was pure, and the qi was truly limpid enough to scoop.

The disciple Qiongchan Zi, deeply pondering the great matter of life and death, revered the immortals and could not but aspire to them, and could not but devote himself to cultivation. Bowing his head, he asked: "Your disciple has often heard that since ancient times, the supreme sages and lofty perfected ones, as well as the immortals of past dynasties, all attained the Dao through cultivating the real. They necessarily took lead and mercury as the root and stem of the golden elixir. But what are lead and mercury?"

The Master said: "Lead and mercury are the beginning of Heaven and Earth, the mother of the myriad things, and the foundation of the golden elixir. They are not common lead, black tin, quicksilver, or cinnabar. Alas! Those who err do not know the true mystery. They privately conjecture and mislead later learners, wasting years and delaying their entire lives—how pitiable! If they do not encounter a true teacher’s illumination, all their efforts are in vain. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without a true teacher, do not rashly guess.* This is precisely what he meant. Now I will point it out for you: true lead and true mercury are none other than body and heart. The sagely teacher said: *The two words ‘body’ and ‘heart’—they are the medicine, they are the fire.* He also said: *To know where the medicine is produced, only in the southwest is the homeland.* The southwest is Kun. Kun pertains to the body, and the essence within the body is the yang within yin. Like the single yang line of Qian entering Kun to form Kan, outwardly yin yet inwardly yang, outwardly soft yet inwardly firm, outwardly Kun yet inwardly Qian—within Kan Water there is Qian Metal, so it is forcibly named *metal within water*. Mercury is the qi within the heart, the yin within yang. Like the single yin line of Kun entering Qian to form Li, outwardly yang yet inwardly yin, outwardly firm yet inwardly soft, outwardly Qian yet inwardly Kun—within Li Fire there is Kun Earth, so it is forcibly named *mercury within cinnabar*. The wondrous resonance of essence and qi is thus forcibly named and symbolized as lead and mercury, so that learners may know there is substance and function. Pursuing this further, nothing lies beyond the two words ‘body’ and ‘heart.’ After body and heart unite as one, lead and mercury both cease to be.

**Question:** What is *drawing out and adding in*?
**Answer:** When the body does not move and qi is stabilized, this is called *drawing out*. When the heart does not move and spirit is stabilized, this is called *adding in*. When body and heart do not move, spirit congeals and qi coalesces—this is called *returning to the origin*. Thus, taking the yang from Kan to supplement the yin in Li and form Qian is called *drawing out lead and adding in mercury*.

**Question:** What is *simmering and refining*?
**Answer:** When body and heart are on the verge of uniting yet have not united, if even the slightest disturbance arises, one counters it with a resolute heart—this is *martial refining*. After body and heart have united and essence and qi have merged, one guards it with a gentle and harmonious heart—this is *civil simmering*. There is no other principle here; simply subduing body and heart is *simmering lead and refining mercury*. Forgetting emotions to nurture nature, emptying the heart to nourish spirit, all conditions suddenly ceasing, all thoughts completely clarified, body and heart unmoving, spirit congealed and qi coalesced—this is called the *foundation of the elixir*, metaphorically termed the *sacred embryo*. All these various names merely describe gathering emotions into nature. When nature is quiescent and emotions are stilled, one illumines the original self, embraces the root and returns to emptiness, and restores the mandate—this is called *elixir completion*, metaphorically termed *rebirth*.

**Question:** The various elixir classics say that the subtlety of cultivation lies in the *mysterious pass*. But where exactly is the mysterious pass?
**Answer:** The mysterious pass is the most profound and wondrous mechanism. How could it have a fixed location? If you fixate on the body, it is not so; if you seek it outside this body, it is also not so. Clinging to the body is attachment to form; clinging to externals is attachment to things. The mysterious pass is simply where the four great elements and five phases do not adhere. Now I will set forth a metaphor to make it easier for you to understand. Consider a marionette: its hands and feet move, performing all manner of dances, yet it all depends on the strings and pulleys, truly controlled by the master. The marionette is like the four great elements constituting the human body; the strings are like the mysterious pass; the master pulling the strings is like the original true nature. Without strings, the marionette cannot move; without the mysterious pass, a person also cannot move. You must simply, in the twelve double-hours of the day, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, apply effort inwardly and seek it: in speech or silence, seeing or hearing—what is it? When body and heart are tranquil and settled, in the moment of true mechanism and wondrous response, you will naturally perceive it. The *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* says: *Quiescent and unmoving*—this is the substance of the mysterious pass. *Stimulated, then penetrating*—this is the function of the mysterious pass. Once you perceive the mysterious pass, having attained it once, medicine, fire times, the three origins, and the eight trigrams are all within it. If people fixate on a physical location for the mysterious pass, even if they exert effort and endure hardship, their endeavor will ultimately fail. If I were to directly point it out, I fear you would not grasp it, nor could you use it. You must perceive it yourself. It is like the precelestial learning of the Confucians, which also requires silent recognition. Mencius said: *The vast qi fills the space between Heaven and Earth*—he called it *hard to describe*. Is not the subtlety of what is hard to describe the mysterious pass? Moreover, like the Buddhists who do not rely on written words, transmitting beyond the teachings, enabling people to apprehend it with spirit and understand it with intention—this is called the *wondrousness of what is not transmitted*. One who knows this principle can then achieve unity that penetrates all things.

**Question:** Some say that revering Buddhism and cultivating the Dao can sever life and death and escape the wheel of rebirth, while studying Confucianism can fulfill human relationships but cannot resolve life and death. Is this not a difference among the Three Teachings?

He replied: How can one who grasps the principle be troubled by life and death? Consider this: exhausting principle and fully realizing one’s nature to the utmost of destiny; tracing origins to return to endings, comprehending all things in their entirety—then one understands the discourse on life and death. Thus, the learning of nature and destiny is truly the orthodox transmission of Confucianism. If one thoroughly penetrates principle and attains clear understanding, how could one fail to sever life and death and escape the wheel of rebirth?

Moreover, when Fuxi first drew the *Yi*, he embodied Heaven to establish teachings and transformed people through the Dao—there was no division among the Three Teachings. As it is said: *August Heaven has no second Dao; the sage has no dual heart.* When he first drew the single line, it symbolized the Supreme Ultimate. With one came two, symbolizing the Two Modes. One is yang, the other yin—*the alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao.* Looking up, he observed the heavens and drew a line to symbolize Heaven; looking down, he examined the earth and drew a line to symbolize Earth; in the middle, he drew a line to symbolize Man. Thus, three lines form *Qian*, symbolizing the Three Powers. Two *Qian* broken form *Kun*, symbolizing the Six Directions. Hence it is said: *The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang; the Dao of Earth is established as soft and hard; the Dao of Man is established as benevolence and righteousness.* Combining the Three Powers and doubling them, six lines form *Kun*.

Speaking of the human body: the Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang—this is the single spirit and qi of the heart; the Dao of Earth is established as soft and hard—this is the physical form of the body; the Dao of Man is established as benevolence and righteousness—this is the emotions and nature of the mind. Heart, body, and mind symbolize the Three Powers of *Qian*; spirit, qi, nature, emotions, and physical form symbolize the Six Directions of *Kun*. The *Yi* says: *Far-off, one takes from things; near, one takes from oneself.* This is what it means.

Someone asked: The *Xici* says *six lines form a hexagram*—why do you say *six lines form Kun*?

He replied: You do not yet understand. When it speaks of six lines forming a hexagram, it refers to King Wen’s doubling of the trigrams. Before King Wen doubled the trigrams, how could there be no Three Powers and Six Directions? The former worthies said: *The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang—this is Heaven’s Qian and Kun; the Dao of Earth is established as soft and hard—this is Earth’s Qian and Kun; the Dao of Man is established as benevolence and righteousness—this is Man’s Qian and Kun.* Extending this reasoning, the two hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the Three Powers and Six Directions—how could this be explained by the doubling of trigrams? What is called *six lines form a hexagram* refers to the post-heaven hexagrams after the doubling.

Someone asked: If the Three Powers and Six Directions were already complete before the doubling of trigrams, then the *Xici* says: *Those who created implements esteemed their images.* Was it not that implements were made according to images, and images were established to create implements?

He replied: Implements were made according to images.

Someone asked: From the Three Sovereigns onward, sages created implements all based on the doubled hexagrams. If implements were made according to images, how could there be a name for doubled hexagrams before King Wen doubled the *Yi*?

He replied: Not so. The former worthies said: *You must believe that before the lines were drawn, the Yi already existed.* Thus, before King Wen doubled the trigrams, all sixty-four hexagrams were complete.

Someone asked: If hexagrams were not doubled, how could the sixty-four hexagrams be obtained?

He replied: They arise from the transformation of hexagrams. One hexagram transforms into eight, and eight transform into sixty-four. For example, in the *Qian* hexagram’s three lines, the upper two are young yang, and the lower one is old yang. Extending this, the *Xun* hexagram emerges—yang transforms into yin, *Qian*’s *Xun*, *Heaven-Wind Gou*. Taking this one hexagram as an example, all hexagrams follow the same pattern.

Someone asked: If hexagrams were not doubled yet still produced sixty-four hexagrams, why did King Wen double them?

He replied: The sixty-four hexagrams arising from undoubled hexagrams were Fuxi’s heart-method, the orthodox transmission of the Dao lineage, guiding learners of later generations to enter the gate of sages together. The sixty-four hexagrams arising from doubled hexagrams were established by King Wen and the Zhou Confucians to set the standard for the people, rectify human relationships, enable people to pursue good fortune and avoid misfortune, and establish the eternal norms of ruler and minister, father and son. Thus, the learning of nature and destiny dare not be lightly expounded in words, nor can one bear to conceal this Dao. Confucius subtly revealed it in the *Xici*, and Master Zhou Dunyi elucidated it in the *Taiji Tushuo*. This is to allow later learners to thoroughly chew and digest it, attaining understanding on their own—thus this learning will not perish in transmission.

Someone asked: What does *the alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao* mean?

He replied: Yin and yang are *Qian* and *Kun*. *Qian* and *Kun* emerge from the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate divides, and the Two Modes are established. The Two Modes are Heaven and Earth. It does not speak of Heaven and Earth but of *Qian* and *Kun* because it values their function over their substance.

Someone asked: *Qian* is yang, *Kun* is yin—why then say Heaven and Earth?

He replied: Heaven and Earth are *Qian* and *Kun*; *Qian* and *Kun* are yin and yang; yin and yang are one Supreme Ultimate; the Supreme Ultimate is originally the Ultimateless. Speaking in terms of the Supreme Ultimate, it is called Heaven and Earth; speaking in terms of the *Yi*, it is called *Qian* and *Kun*; speaking in terms of the Dao, it is called yin and yang. Speaking of the human body: Heaven and Earth are the physical form; *Qian* and *Kun* are nature and emotions; yin and yang are spirit and qi. Speaking in terms of symbolic correspondences: Heaven is the dragon, Earth the tiger; *Qian* the horse, *Kun* the ox; yang the crow, yin the hare. Speaking in terms of the Golden Elixir: Heaven is the cauldron, Earth the furnace; *Qian* is metal, *Kun* is earth; yin is mercury, yang is lead. Spoken of separately, they have various names; spoken of together, they are the alternation of yin and yang. Those who cultivate immortality and refine lead and mercury into the elixir are uniting body and mind to return to their original state, merging yin and yang to revert to the Supreme Ultimate.

Someone asked: What is *three-five-one*?

He replied: The Three Origins and Five Phases. East three and south two form one five; north one and west four form two fives; central earth is three fives—this is called *three-five.*

Speaking in terms of the human body: nature as three and spirit as two form one five; emotion as four and essence as one form two fives; intent as five is three fives. When the three fives unite as one, they return to the Supreme Ultimate; when body, mind, and intent merge as one, the sacred embryo is formed. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *"Three-five-one"* are but three words—it is the Three Origins, Five Phases, and unified qi. From ancient times to now, those who truly understand this are rare. The world seldom knows it. East three and south two together form five: east three is nature, south two is spirit. North one and west four share the same principle: north one is essence, west four is emotion. *Wu* and *ji* return to the generative number five—earth’s number is five, which is intent. When the three families meet, the infant is formed. The three families are body, mind, and intent; the infant is the functional result of the three fives uniting as one. The infant is one that contains true qi; the infant is another name for the True One, the Supreme One containing truth. After ten months, the embryo is complete, and the foundation of sagehood is laid. With ten months of effort, one sheds the mortal embryo and transcends the ordinary to enter sagehood. Pursuing the Way of the Golden Elixir in this manner truly establishes the foundation of sagehood.

Someone asked: The *Xici* says, "Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the Changes move within them." What does this mean?

He replied: Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and humans are born between them—this is called the Three Powers. Thus, humans and all things are born and ceaselessly transform. It does not speak of humans and things but of the *Changes* because the sage speaks of *Qian* and *Kun* as the gate of the *Changes*, adapting to the Dao through constant transformation. In the Golden Elixir, taking *Qian* and *Kun* as the cauldron and vessel is like Heaven and Earth establishing their positions; taking yin and yang as the mechanism of transformation is the *Changes* moving within them. From the beginning, gathering the medicine is inexhaustible, and the fire times proceed without cease.

Someone asked: Opening the door is called *Qian*, closing the door is called *Kun*, and the alternation of opening and closing is called *change*. What does this mean?

He replied: The alternation of opening and closing is the alternation of movement and stillness. *Qian* is yang, *Kun* is yin—like the opening and closing of a door, it is the gate of *Qian* and *Kun* in the *Changes*. Moreover, as yin and yang mutually move and rest, their mechanism operates unceasingly. *Yuan*, *heng*, *li*, and *zhen* determine the four seasons and complete the yearly cycle—this is *change* and *ease*. The supreme Dao and spirit-qi blend indistinguishably, pervading the Three Powers and the myriad things. Opening and closing are endless, reaching vastness and exhausting subtlety. Speaking of the human body: breathing is the example. Exhaling connects to the root of Heaven—this is called *opening*; inhaling connects to the root of Earth—this is called *closing*. One exhalation and one inhalation transform and generate the golden liquid—this is called *change*. Opening and closing, exhalation and inhalation, are the gate of the Mysterious Female, the root of Heaven and Earth. The so-called breathing is not the breath of mouth and nose but the true rest of opening and closing.

Someone asked: *"The Dao of Qian forms the male; the Dao of Kun forms the female."* What does this mean?

He replied: *Qian* is the father, *Kun* is the mother. The initial yang line of *Qian* interacts with *Kun* to form *Zhen*, and *Zhen*’s first line yields the male—this is called the eldest son. The initial yin line of *Kun* interacts with *Qian* to form *Xun*, and *Xun*’s first line yields the female—this is called the eldest daughter. The middle yang line of *Qian* interacts with *Kun* to form *Kan*, and *Kan*’s second line yields the male—this is called the middle son. The middle yin line of *Kun* interacts with *Qian* to form *Li*, and *Li*’s second line yields the female—this is called the middle daughter. The third yang line of *Qian* interacts with *Kun* to form *Gen*, and *Gen*’s third line yields the male—this is called the youngest son. The third yin line of *Kun* interacts with *Qian* to form *Dui*, and *Dui*’s third line yields the female—this is called the youngest daughter. *Qian* produces three sons, *Kun* produces three daughters, and together *Qian* and *Kun* give birth to six children—these are the eight trigrams.

Speaking of the body: at the moment of conception, one receives the essence of father and mother to form this body. This essence is metaphorically called *heavenly ren* and *earthly gui* in the elixir classics. At the initial union, if *heavenly ren* arrives first and *earthly gui* follows, *gui* envelops *ren* to form a male; if *earthly gui* arrives first and *heavenly ren* follows, *ren* envelops *gui* to form a female. If *ren* and *gui* arrive simultaneously, a twin birth results. If *ren* arrives first and *gui* is delayed, or *gui* arrives first and *ren* is delayed, conception does not occur. Thus it is said: *"The Dao of Qian forms the male; the Dao of Kun forms the female."* Now, *heavenly ren* and *earthly gui* are the primordial essence and qi of Heaven and Earth. They are also what the elixir classics call *Kan*-*wu* and *Li*-*ji*, alternate names for lead and mercury. When regulated externally, they form a person; when cultivated internally, they form the elixir. The world does not know that whether one has sons or daughters is truly determined by fate and not by human effort. If one does not cut off lust and desires but instead engages in self-cultivation only after essence and vitality are exhausted, one will die young—this is deeply lamentable. How could they know that those who have few desires and bear sons or daughters are noble and long-lived, while those who have many desires and bear sons or daughters are base and short-lived?

Someone asked: *"That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel."* What does this mean?

He replied: That which is above form has no physical substance; that which is below form has body and function. That without physical substance pertains to nature and mercury; that with body and function pertains to destiny and lead. In sum, they do not go beyond body and mind.

Someone asked: The sage *"uses the Changes to wash the mind and retreats to conceal it in secrecy."* What is this *secrecy*?

He replied: It is the utmost sincerity. The principles of the *Changes* reach vastness and exhaust subtlety. The sage savors their meaning, washes the mind and purifies thoughts, concealing them in perfect sincerity.

Someone asked: The *Book of Documents* says, *"The human mind is perilous; the Dao-mind is subtle. Only with utmost refinement and singular focus can one truly hold to the center."* How does one hold to the *center*?

He replied: *Hold* is a term of certainty. *Center* is the exact middle. The Dao-mind is subtle and hard to perceive; the human mind is perilous and unstable. Even the most realized person has a human mind, and even the most foolish has a Dao-mind. If one can always keep the mind upright and centered, this subtlety is difficult to perceive.

If the mind slightly deviates and loses the center, this is why it becomes perilous and unstable. For those who cultivate immortality, choosing one path and holding to it unwaveringly, always grasping the center, naturally transforms peril into stability and subtlety into clarity. The Golden Elixir uses the center as the Mysterious Pass—this follows the same principle.

Someone asked: *"Heaven’s burden bears all things without sound, without scent."* How is this so?
He replied: When utmost sincerity shines forth, though no sound may be heard nor scent perceived, the Dao of Heaven cannot be concealed. As the *Daoist Scripture* says, *"Vast and profoundly mysterious"*—this is the perfection of truth.

Someone asked: *"Unknowing, unperceiving, yet following the decree of the Emperor."* How is this so?
He replied: The sage is born with knowledge, silently aligning with the principles of Heaven. This is what is meant by *"without thought, one attains; without effort, one hits the mark"*—achieving the Dao of effortless spontaneity. This is what the *Doctrine of the Mean* calls *"sincerity leading to clarity."* To speak of *"clarity leading to sincerity"* is precisely the teaching of the sage. Those who study the Dao, if endowed with deep karmic roots, directly comprehend their nature and naturally fulfill their destiny—this is *"born with knowledge."* Those with shallow roots cannot directly grasp their nature; they must be taught and enter through effort, progressing from existence to non-existence, from the coarse to the subtle. Thus, they first fulfill their destiny before comprehending their nature—this is *"learning to know."*

Someone asked: *The Master ate coarse food, drank plain water, rested his head on his bent arm, yet found joy therein.* Where did the Master’s joy lie?
He replied: The Master’s joy was in Heaven, and what he knew was destiny. Thus, he *"found joy in Heaven and knew destiny, free from care."* Even when besieged by the people of Kuang, he still played the zither and sang for his own delight, never far from the *Changes*. Through cultivating the self, he once more perceived the heart of Heaven and Earth, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach destiny—this is the subtlety of the Golden Elixir.

Someone asked: *How did Yanzi find joy in his simple bamboo bowl and gourd ladle?*
He replied: Yanzi grasped the Master’s principle of *"finding joy in Heaven and knowing destiny, free from care,"* and thus his joy remained unchanged. His *"feigned foolishness,"* his *"fasting of the mind"* and *"sitting in forgetfulness,"* his *"dimming of hearing and sight"* and *"discarding of wisdom and thought"*—even in frequent poverty, this too is the subtlety of the Golden Elixir.

Someone asked: *Zengzi wore tattered hemp robes yet sang with a voice that filled Heaven and Earth, so that even the Son of Heaven could not make him a subject nor the feudal lords befriend him.* How was this so?
He replied: Zengzi’s marvel lay in his *"single affirmation,"* where both speech and hearing were forgotten. Thus, he mastered the Dao of *"cultivating the self, ordering the family, governing the state, and pacifying the world"*—the unifying principle.

Someone asked: *When Zilu asked about death, the Master replied, "If you do not yet understand life, how can you understand death?"* How is this so?
He replied: Life and death are as constant as day and night. Knowing day exists, one knows night exists. As the *Changes* says: *"Tracing beginnings and returning to endings, one understands the discourse on life and death."* The *Elixir Scriptures* say: *"Before father and mother were born, this is the foundation of the Golden Elixir."* The Buddhists ask: *"Before this body existed, where was one’s nature?"* Seeking thus, the entry points of the Three Teachings converge. One must trace the origin to know the end, follow the stream to know the source. If one thoroughly investigates this body—whence it comes and whither it goes—life and death are naturally understood. Have you studied the *Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate*? What existed before the Supreme Ultimate divided?

Someone asked: *Before the Supreme Ultimate divided, its form was like an egg. What lay beyond the egg?*
He replied: The Great Void. When all people receive qi, their forms are undifferentiated, like an egg. After birth, nature and destiny are established, and all beyond the body is the Great Void.

Someone asked: *When a person is in the mother’s womb, do they possess nature?*
He replied: The womb is filthy and impure—how could the numinous nature abide there?
Further asked: *At five or seven months of pregnancy, the fetus suddenly stirs—is this not nature?*
He replied: It is not nature, but merely qi. While in the womb, one breathes with the mother; upon leaving, nature and destiny are established, and one possesses their own Heaven and Earth. Consider a snake cut in two: the front still moves, the tail still lives. Or a crab cooked until done, yet a discarded leg still twitches—is this nature? Investigate this principle, and you will know it is qi moving, not nature.

Someone asked: *The saying goes, "My Dao is unified by one principle."* How is this so?
He replied: The sage speaks of the single principle within the body, which can unify the Three Powers, the Three Teachings, and all things. As the Buddhists say, *"no self, no others, no sentient beings, no lifespan,"* and the Daoists say, *"comprehending the ten thousand things is complete"*—all are unified by one principle.

Someone asked: *When the World-Honored One held up a flower before the assembly, only Kāśyapa smiled faintly. The World-Honored One said, "I possess the treasury of the true Dharma-eye, the wondrous mind of nirvana, and now entrust it to Mahākāśyapa."* What did his faint smile signify?
He replied: When the World-Honored One held up the flower, none in the assembly perceived the Buddha’s mind—only Kāśyapa saw its subtlety and thus smiled. Therefore, the World-Honored One transmitted the wondrous principle beyond the mind to Kāśyapa.

Someone asked: *Bodhidharma came from the West without relying on written words, directly pointing to the human mind to see nature and attain Buddhahood. What does "seeing nature" mean?*
He replied: Bodhidharma used the wondrous principle of true emptiness to directly point to the human mind. *"Seeing nature"* means turning the emotions of things to emptiness, thereby naturally perceiving one’s nature. How could it depend on transmission through brush and tongue?

Someone asked: *Confucians have the *Prior Heaven Changes*, Buddhists have the *Prajñā Sūtra*, and Daoists have the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure*—are these not written words?*
He replied: No. All are sages expressing the ineffable through words, revealing the Dao of true constancy. The Buddhist canon, with its vast collection of scriptures, records, and discourses on karma; the Confucian Nine Classics, Three Commentaries, and the hundred schools; the Daoist *Cavernous Mystery* scriptures and various elixir texts—these are the pathways to entering the Dao, the ladder to transcendence.

When one reaches the ultimate state, not even a single word is needed. Your many questions are but a raft for crossing the river. The step beyond lies in seeking beyond words and phrases. If, through stumbling or collision, you awaken and penetrate through, you return to the Great Ultimate—perfectly luminous, aware, and illuminating; empty yet spiritually penetrating; with both nature and life complete, form and spirit equally wondrous; and your body one with the void. To stand shoulder to shoulder with immortals and buddhas is then no difficult feat.

Someone asked: *You say the three teachings share a single principle—this is most enlightening. Yet Buddhists speak of nirvāṇa, while Daoists speak of "shedding the mortal coil." These seem different.*
He replied: *Nirvāṇa and "shedding the mortal coil" are but one and the same principle. "Shedding the mortal coil" means casting off the ordinary body—is this not nirvāṇa? Just as Daoists refine essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness—embracing the root and returning to the void—this is identical in principle to the Buddhist return to emptiness, with no difference whatsoever.*

Another asked: *After shedding the mortal coil, is there still transformation?*
He replied: *There is indeed transformation. The sage says: "A body beyond the body is not yet extraordinary; only when the void is shattered does the full truth appear." Thus, after shedding the mortal coil, one must stand firmly on the ground until one’s body becomes one with the void—only then is the task complete. For the Buddha speaks of "true emptiness," the Confucian of "non-action," and the Daoist of "spontaneity"—all are embracing the root and returning to the origin, becoming one with the Great Void. How could those who cling to partial truths ever grasp this all-pervading Dao?*

Jie’an remarked: *Master, you have attained the wondrous Dao of the Golden Elixir and harmonized the profound mysteries of the three teachings. Your answers to questions are supremely subtle and wondrous. How could I dare keep this secret? I shall have it printed and shared with those of like aspiration to awaken together. Like the Sui pearl and Zhao jade, those with discernment will recognize its worth.*

**Zhao Ding’an’s Questions**
The Master said: *The ancestral masters and perfected sages of past ages possessed the supreme, most true Dao, which they transmitted to save people in the world. Do you know of this?*
Ding’an replied: *Your disciple, newly entered into the mysterious gate, is utterly foolish and dull. By your grace in accepting me, I count this the fortune of a thousand lifetimes. Of the supreme, most true Dao, I truly know nothing—pray, Master, enlighten me.*
The Master said: *The supreme, most true Dao is that which is beyond all that can be surpassed, the most profound of the profound, without form yet forming all, spontaneously so—this is what is called the ultimate and most wondrous. The sages gave it the forced name of "Dao." Since ancient times, all transcendent immortals have attained realization through this—none have cultivated and verified it by any other means. From mouth to mouth, from heart to heart across the generations, the oral transmission of the Golden Elixir’s essentials is none other than this supreme, most true and wondrous Dao.*

Ding’an asked: *The supreme, most true mystery is likened to the Golden Elixir—what is its principle?*
The Master said: *"Gold" signifies hardness; "elixir" signifies roundness. Buddhists liken it to "perfect enlightenment," Confucians to the "Great Ultimate." It is no other thing—only the original, single numinous spirit. The original true nature is indestructible through endless kalpas, like gold in its hardness, like the elixir in its roundness, growing ever brighter with refinement. Buddhists say: "○ This is true suchness." Confucians say: "○ This is the Great Ultimate." Our Dao says: "○ This is the Golden Elixir." The substance is the same; only the names differ.*

*The* Book of Changes *says: "The Changes have the Great Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes." The Great Ultimate is the designation for the spontaneous and formless. The Two Modes are the one yin and one yang. Yin and yang are heaven and earth. Humans are born between heaven and earth—this is called the Three Powers. The Dao of the Three Powers is fully embodied in a single person. The Great Ultimate is the original spirit; the Two Modes are body and mind. In terms of the elixir, the Great Ultimate is the mother of the elixir; the Two Modes are true lead and true mercury. What is called lead and mercury are not mercury, cinnabar, sulfur, black tin, herbs, or trees; nor are they essence, fluids, tears, saliva, heart, kidneys, qi, or blood. They are the original spirit within the body and the original qi within the body. When the body is unmoving, essence and qi congeal—this is likened to the elixir. What is called the elixir is the body. ○ is the true nature. Extracting ○ from the elixir is called "elixir accomplished." The so-called elixir is not fabricated from external things; it is the fulfillment of the original source from which one is born, thereby attaining the most true. Few in the world understand this.*

*Today’s practitioners of the elixir mostly fail to receive the correct transmission. They all seek externally, following the deviant and turning from the orthodox. Thus, many study but few succeed. Some refine the five metals and eight stones; some refine the three evils and five falsities; some refine the qi beyond clouds and mist; some refine the essences of the sun and moon; some gather the light of the stars; some imagine a pellet in the void to form the elixir; some imagine an object in the cinnabar field as the elixir; some fly the golden essence from behind the elbow; some visualize between the eyebrows; some return essence to replenish the brain; some circulate qi to the navel; some ingest filth and swallow essence; some inhale the new and exhale the old; some practice the Eight Brocades or the Six-Character Qi; some shake the spine; some twist the windlass; some close the tailbone; some guard the navel stem; some gather heavenly water; some refine autumn stone; some bend and stretch in daoyin; some stroke and massage to regulate; some silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor; some press the tongue to the upper palate; some return the three fields; some close the breath and circulate qi; some gather the three fires in the bladder; some drill the five phases in the sea of bitterness. Such minor methods number in the thousands. Even with diligent practice and gathering, they will never accomplish the great task.*

*The scripture says: "The true Dharma is hard to encounter, and many go astray; the true Dao often enters deviant sects." This is what it means. The essentials of the most true are the simplest and easiest—difficult to encounter but easy to accomplish. If one meets a perfected person’s guidance, none fail to succeed.*

Ding’an said: *Your disciple, by good fortune from past lives, has met you, Master, and is blessed to receive your nurturing grace. I pray you bestow the essentials of the Golden Elixir and grant me your guidance.*

The Master said: Listen carefully now, and I shall speak to you of these matters. Those who refine the Golden Elixir must wholly seize the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth. They take Qian and Kun as their crucible and vessel, the sun and moon, water and fire, yin and yang as the mechanism of transformation, the hare and the toad as the medicine. Relying on the turning of the Celestial Stem and the revolving of the Dipper’s handle, they gather the medicine at the proper time and move the tally accordingly. Advancing fire and retreating tally follow the seasons of a year; drawing forth lead and adding mercury mirror the waxing and waning of a month. They gather the Five Phases, unite the Four Images, pursue the Two Qi to return them to the Yellow Path, and assemble the Three Essences in the Primordial Palace. Returning to the root and restoring life, when merit is complete and spirit perfected, the mortal sheds its form to become an immortal—this is called the completion of the Elixir.

Ding’an said: The creative transformations of Heaven and Earth truly seem difficult to seize.

The Master said: There is nothing beyond this single body—what difficulty could there be? Heaven and Earth are the bodily form; water and fire are the essence and qi; yin and yang are the body and mind; the hare and toad are the nature and emotions. Thus, the bodily form serves as the crucible and furnace, essence and qi as water and fire, emotions and nature as the mechanism of transformation, and body and mind as the medicinal materials. Fearing that students would have no standard to follow, the sages used Heaven and Earth as analogies. The body and the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth are never separate—these two words, body and mind, are both the medicine and the fire. Thus, the celestial hun and terrestrial po, the Qian horse and Kun ox, the yang lead and yin mercury, the Kan man and Li woman, the sun crow and moon hare—none lie beyond these two words, body and mind.

The turning of the Celestial Stem is the Celestial Heart. The scripture says: "Observe the Dao with the heart, and the Dao is the heart; observe the heart with the Dao, and the heart is the Dao." The revolving of the Dipper’s handle is the Mysterious Pass. The Mysterious Pass is the most profound and wondrous mechanism. Yet today’s students cling to physical forms: some say it is between the eyebrows, others the navel, still others the space between the two kidneys, or behind the navel and before the kidneys, or the bladder, or the Cinnabar Field. Some say the head has nine palaces, with the Mysterious Pass at the center; others point to the birth gate as the place of bodily origin, or the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female—all are mistaken. To fixate on physical form is entirely wrong. Yet one cannot abandon this body to seek it elsewhere. Why do none of the various elixir scriptures specify its location? It is difficult to describe in words or brushstrokes, hence it is called the Mysterious Pass. Thus, the sages inscribed only a single character, "center," to show that this character is the Mysterious Pass. Clearly, this "center" is not the middle between inside and outside, nor the midpoint between top and bottom, nor the center within a center.

The Buddhists say: "Neither think of good nor think of evil; at just such a time, what is one’s original face?" This is the center of the Chan school. The Confucians say: "Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are aroused, it is called the center"—this is the center of the Ru school. The Daoists say: "Where thoughts do not arise is called the center"—this is the center of the Daoist school. These are the centers employed by the Three Teachings.

The *Book of Changes* says: "Still and unmoving, this is the substance of the center; moved and thus penetrating, this is the function of the center." Laozi said: "Attain utmost emptiness, guard steadfast stillness; the myriad things arise together, and I thereby observe their return." The *Book of Changes* says: "Return is how the heart of Heaven and Earth is seen." Now, in the *Return* hexagram, one yang is born beneath five yins. Yin is stillness; yang is movement. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement is born. This very point of movement is the Mysterious Pass. Simply apply effort at the moment of thought’s arising in the twelve double-hours, and the Mysterious Pass will naturally appear. Once the Mysterious Pass is seen, the medicine, fire times, operations, drawing forth and adding—even the transformation of the embryo and the shedding of the mortal form—all proceed from this single aperture.

To gather the medicine is to gather the true lead and true mercury within the body. The medicine arises at a specific time—not at the winter solstice, not at the moon’s birth, not at the zi hour. The patriarchs said: "To refine the Elixir, one need not seek the winter solstice; within the body, a yang is spontaneously born." They also said: "When lead sees gui arising, swiftly gather it; when gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste." Thus, when gui arises and a yang is born within the body, one may begin to gather it. After the Two Qi unite, one must recognize how to maintain fullness and not overdo it—when the moon is full, it is no longer fit to taste.

Advancing fire and retreating tally lack a standard, so the sages used the seasons of a year—the coming and going of cold and heat—as the model for fire and tally. They also used the waxing and waning of a month to illustrate the principles of drawing forth and adding. For example, at the winter solstice, one yang is born—the *Return* hexagram, the twelfth month. Two yangs form the *Approach* hexagram, the first month; three yangs the *Peace* hexagram, the second month; four yangs the *Great Strength* hexagram, the third month; five yangs the *Decisiveness* hexagram, the fourth month. Pure yang is the *Qian* hexagram, where yang reaches its extreme and yin is born—the fifth month. One yin forms the *Encounter* hexagram, the sixth month; two yins the *Following* hexagram, the seventh month; three yins the *Stagnation* hexagram, the eighth month; four yins the *Observation* hexagram, the ninth month; five yins the *Splitting Apart* hexagram, the tenth month. Pure yin is the *Kun* hexagram, where yin reaches its extreme and yang is born—cycling back to the beginning. This is the mechanism of advancing and retreating fire and tally.

Yet students cling to words and adhere to images, beginning to advance fire on the winter solstice, retreating tally on the summer solstice, and bathing in the second and eighth months—utterly unaware of the essentials. Seeing that students misdirect their efforts, the sages condensed the seasons of a year into a single month: the new and full moons represent the winter and summer solstices, the two quarters represent the second and eighth months, two and a half days represent a month, and thirty days represent a year. Yet people still fixate on the moon. The sages further condensed the waxing and waning of a month into a single day: zi and wu represent the new and full moons, mao and you represent the two quarters. Students then fixate on the day.

A recent perfected master said: "Within a single moment of effort, the seasons of a year are contained."

It further states: Before father and mother gave birth, where were the years, months, days, and hours? This is how the sages guide beginners to avoid misdirecting their efforts. Yet stubborn disciples, failing to fathom the principle, cling to forms and symbols, exhausting their minds in vain. I now point directly to you: the arising of *gui* within the body is the first yang; yang ascending and yin descending is the three yangs. When yin and yang divide, it is the four yangs—embodying the second month, like the waxing crescent, corresponding to *mao* hour, where one should bathe before advancing fire. When yin and yang unite and spirit and qi merge, it is the six yangs. After yin and yang intermingle and spirit and qi fuse, one must recognize the need to hold fullness, knowing when to stop lest all prior effort be wasted. Thus it is said: "Gold at its zenith is too distant to taste." Then one retreats the tally, embodying the first yin, until yin and yang divide again, symbolizing the three yins—this is the time for bathing, like the eighth month, corresponding to the waning crescent, as in *you* hour. Then, retreating to the six yins, at the extreme of yin, yang is born—within a single moment, a full celestial cycle is completed. Simply follow this practice, and over time, effort gradually congeals and coalesces; the formless generates form, and the sacred embryo is forged—this is called the completion of the elixir.

Ding’an asked: "The initial effort and the celestial cycle’s operation have already been revealed, yet the myriad alternate names remain beyond my grasp. I hope the master will point them out."
The master replied: "Alternate names are merely metaphors, all deriving from the two words *body* and *mind*. At the outset of practice, gather the ear’s resonance, contain the eye’s light, seal the tongue’s breath, regulate the nose’s breathing—so the four great elements remain unmoving. Let essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent each settle in their place: this is called the *five qi converging at the origin*. Directing them into the central palace is called *gathering the five phases*. When the mind is still, the dragon hums; when the body is still, the tiger roars; when body and mind are both still, this is called *subduing the dragon and taming the tiger*. The dragon’s hum secures qi; the tiger’s roar secures essence—grasping firmly the numinous root. Essence and qi are likened to the tortoise and snake; body and mind to the dragon and tiger. When dragon-tiger and tortoise-snake merge into one, it is called *harmonizing the four images*. Governing emotion with nature is called *metal and wood in union*. Directing qi with essence is called *water and fire in communion*. Wood and fire share a source, two natures forming one family—east’s three and south’s two together make five. Water and metal share a source, two natures forming one family—north’s one and west’s four are jointly held. Earth dwells in the central palace, belonging to intent; the five numbers of *wu* and *ji* return to the generative number five. When body, mind, and intent merge into one, the three families meet to form the infant—this is called *the three and five in fusion*. Refining essence into qi, refining qi into spirit, refining spirit into emptiness—this is called *the three flowers gathering in the tripod*, or *the three passes*. Today’s practitioners often designate the coccyx, the spine’s midpoint, and the jade pillow as the three passes, but these are merely methods, not the essentials. Where the mind stirs with thought is the *mysterious female*; those who point to the mouth and nose are mistaken. Body, mind, and intent are the three essentials. The nature within the mind is called *mercury within cinnabar*; the qi within the body is called *metal within water*. Metal inherently generates water, being water’s mother, yet metal resides within water—thus it is said: *the mother conceals the child’s embryo*. Do not let external realms enter, nor internal realms depart: this is called *sealing and securing*. Motionless stillness is called *nurturing the fire*. Spontaneous emptiness is called *operation*. Sincerity and unwavering resolve are called *guarding the city*. Subduing inner demons is called *field combat*. True mercury is called the *radiant maiden*; true lead is called the *infant*. The embryonic intent is called the *yellow woman*. Nature and emotion are called *husband and wife*. Calming the mind and settling intent, with nature still and spirit numinous, the two substances form a mass, the three origins converge—this is called *forming the embryo*. Cherishing the numinous root is called *warm nurturing*. Warm nurturing is like a dragon tending its pearl, like a hen brooding her eggs—guard it diligently, lest even a hair’s deviation ruin all prior effort. When the yang spirit emerges from the husk, it is called *shedding the embryo*. Returning to the root and restoring life is called *transcending and liberation*. Shattering emptiness is called *fulfillment*.

Ding’an asked: "When the golden elixir is formed, can it still be seen?"
The master replied: "It can."
Ding’an asked: "Does it have form?"
The master replied: "It has no form."
Ding’an asked: "If it has no form, how can it be seen?"
The master replied: "The golden elixir is but a forced name—how could it have form? What is called *visible* cannot be seen with the eyes."
A Buddhist text says: "Within non-seeing, one intimately sees; within intimate seeing, one does not see."
The *Daoist Scripture* states: "Looked for but not seen, listened for but not heard—this is called the Dao. Looked for but not seen, yet never not seen; listened for but not heard, yet never not heard." What is called *visible and audible* is not within the reach of ears and eyes—only the mind sees, only intent hears. For example, when a great wind rises, entering mountains it shakes trees, entering water it stirs waves—how can one say it does not exist? Yet when observed, it cannot be seen; when grasped, it cannot be held—how can one say it exists? The essence of the golden elixir is likewise. Thus, at the outset of elixir refinement, being and non-being mutually employ each other, movement and stillness depend on one another, until success is achieved. All conditions suddenly cease, all dharmas become empty; movement and stillness are both forgotten, being and non-being are both transcended—only then does the mysterious pearl take form, and the Great One return to truth. With nature and life both complete, form and spirit both wondrous, one emerges from being and enters non-being, roaming freely beyond the clouds—truly attaining the golden immortal. Therefore, the classics and elixir texts employ myriad alternate names to guide practitioners, leading them from the coarse to the subtle, gradually entering the wondrous realm. Yet upon seeing nature and awakening to emptiness, the matter no longer lies on paper. It is like a boat crossing the river, ferrying the people—once the far shore is reached, the boat is no longer needed."

The former worthies said: "Having caught the hare, forget the snare; having caught the fish, forget the trap"—this is precisely what is meant. Now, as I speak these words to you, do not cling to the language itself. Simply chew them thoroughly and savor them deeply, for they have yet to exhaust the source. If, upon hearing a single phrase, the ground of your mind opens and you directly enter the realm of non-doing, this is not difficult. There are yet higher mechanisms that cannot be lightly described; they must be sought beyond words.

*Questions on the Golden Elixir*
I have observed that later commentaries on the elixir classics and philosophical texts vary in their interpretations. Some fixate on the physical form, others on written words; some take purity as bitter emptiness, others regard mercury and lead as having tangible form. With such differing views, how can later generations avoid confusion? Yet the supreme Dao is one—how could there be two?

Moreover, many recent elixir texts compile only side doors. For instance, explaining the seven returns and nine reversions through the cyclical positions of *yin* and *zi*, or *kun* and *shen*—is this not erroneous? I have now gathered the essentials of elixir texts into *Thirty-Six Questions*, to dispel the confusion of later practitioners. Those who understand may savor them.

**Question:** What is the nine reversion?
**Answer:** Nine is the completion number of metal. Reversion means returning to the origin—this is simply using nature to govern emotion. Emotion belongs to metal; when emotion returns to nature, it is called the nine reversion. The elixir texts say: "When metal returns to nature at first, it may be called the reverted elixir." This is what is meant. To take the progression from *zi* to *shen* as the nine reversion is incorrect.

**Question:** What is the seven return?
**Answer:** Seven is the completion number of fire. Return means returning to the root—this is simply refining spirit to return to emptiness. Spirit belongs to fire; refining spirit to return to emptiness is called the seven return. To take the progression from *yin* to *shen* as the seven return is incorrect. *The Awakening to Reality* says: "Do not rely on the *yin*-*zi* or *kun*-*shen* cycles; only the standard of the five phases matters." This is precisely the point.

**Question:** What are the three passes?
**Answer:** They are the mechanisms of the three origins. Refining essence into qi is the first pass; refining qi into spirit is the middle pass; refining spirit to return to emptiness is the upper pass. To point to the coccyx, spine, and jade pillow as the three passes is merely a working method, not the essential teaching. The essentials of attaining truth lie in the three passes—how could they have fixed locations? They reside in the oral instructions.

**Question:** What is the mysterious pass?
**Answer:** It is the most mysterious and wondrous mechanism. It has no fixed location. Today, many point to the navel wheel, the crown of the head, the glabella, the space between the kidneys, or the area between the kidneys and navel—all these are side doors. The elixir texts say: "The mysterious pass is an aperture not in the four directions, above or below, inside or outside, nor to the side, nor even in the center—it is where the four great elements and five phases do not adhere."

**Question:** What are the three palaces?
**Answer:** They are the palaces where the three origins reside. Spirit dwells in the *qian* palace, qi in the central palace, and essence in the *kun* palace. To point to the three fields is incorrect.

**Question:** What are the three essentials?
**Answer:** The aperture of returning to the root, the pass of reviving life, and the valley of emptiness—these are the three essentials. To point to the mouth and nose as the three essentials is incorrect.

**Question:** What is the mysterious female?
**Answer:** "The valley spirit does not die—this is called the mysterious female." To point to the mouth and nose is incorrect. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: "Where the thought arises is the mysterious female." This is correct. I say: where the thought arises is the root of life and death—how could it not be the mysterious female? Though this, too, is a working method. The supreme vehicle lies in the oral instructions.

**Question:** What is the true seed?
**Answer:** Before heaven and earth divided, that single point of numinous clarity—this is it. Some say humans arise from a single qi and take qi as the true seed. Others say the body arises from thought and take thought as the true seed. Still others say the body arises from the essence of the two and five, taking essence as the true seed. These three explanations seem correct but are not. The Buddha said: "The root of birth and death through countless kalpas—fools call it the original true." This is what is meant.

**Question:** What is the tripod and furnace?
**Answer:** Body and mind are the tripod and furnace. The elixir texts say: "First take *qian* and *kun* as the tripod vessel, then gather the sun and moon as medicine to refine." *Qian* is the mind, *kun* is the body. Those who set up furnaces and tripods externally are mistaken.

**Question:** What are the medicinal substances?
**Answer:** True lead and true mercury are the medicinal substances—these are simply the original two things.

**Question:** What are the inner and outer medicines?
**Answer:** Refining essence, refining qi, refining spirit—their substance is one, but their functions differ. The essence of intercourse, the qi of breathing, and the spirit of thought—these are the outer medicines. The primordial supreme essence, the empty and void qi, and the indestructible original spirit—these are the inner medicines. The elixir texts say: "The twofold function of inner and outer"—this is what is meant.

**Question:** What does "knocking bamboo to summon the turtle and swallow the jade mushroom" mean?
**Answer:** Knocking bamboo means regulating the breath. Summoning the turtle means gathering essence. Refining essence into qi, using qi to gather essence, essence and qi blending and fusing to form the jade mushroom—gathering and swallowing it preserves life.

**Question:** What does "strumming the zither to summon the phoenix and drink the knife-powder" mean?
**Answer:** Strumming the zither means emptying the mind. Summoning the phoenix means nurturing spirit. Emptying the mind and nurturing spirit, the mind becomes clear and spirit transforms—earth of the two [spleen and stomach] forms the powder. Gathering and drinking it perfects the nature.

**Question:** What is the five qi returning to the origin?
**Answer:** When the body does not move, essence is firm—water returns to the origin. When the mind does not move, qi is firm—fire returns to the origin. When nature is quiescent, the hun-spirit is stored—wood returns to the origin. When emotion is forgotten, the po-spirit is subdued—metal returns to the origin.

When the four great elements are harmonious, intention settles—earth returns to the origin. This is called the five qi returning to the origin.

**Question:** What is the Yellow Dame?
**Answer:** Yellow is the color of the center. Dame is the title of the mother. All things are born of earth, and earth is the mother of all things, thus she is called the Yellow Dame. The fetal intention in humans is this. Some say the spleen spirit is the Yellow Dame, but this is incorrect.

**Question:** What is the Metal Duke?
**Answer:** In principle, the yang within Qian enters Kun to form Kan. Kan is water, and metal is the father of water, thus it is called the Metal Duke. In symbolic terms, the character for "duke" (公) is added to the edge of "metal" (金), signifying lead.

**Question:** Kan is the Great Yin—how then is it likened to an infant?
**Answer:** Kan is originally the body of Kun, thus it is called the Great Yin. Having received the yang of Qian, it becomes Shaoyang, and so it is likened to an infant—carrying yin while embracing yang.

**Question:** Li is the Great Yang—why then is it likened to the maiden?
**Answer:** Li is originally the body of Qian, thus it is called the Great Yang. Having received the yin of Kun, it becomes Shaoyin, and so it is likened to the maiden—yang enfolding yin within.

**Question:** What is true gold?
**Answer:** Gold is the original spirit, imperishable through kalpas, growing ever brighter with refinement—thus it is called true gold.

**Question:** What is meant by mother and child?
**Answer:** It is metal within water. Metal is the mother of water, and metal is concealed within water—thus the mother hides within the child’s womb. Likewise, spirit is the mother of the body, and spirit is concealed within the body, likened to the mother hiding within the child’s womb.

**Question:** What is meant by guest and host?
**Answer:** Nature is the master of the body, while the body is the guest. Now, borrowing this body to nurture this nature, we let the body serve as the host. As the alchemical texts say: *"Let him be the host while I remain the guest."*

**Question:** What is the primordial qi?
**Answer:** Before heaven and earth were divided, there was only a single numinous essence—this is the true yang within the body. As it precedes the covering and bearing of heaven and earth, it is called the primordial.

**Question:** What are water and fire?
**Answer:** Heaven takes the sun and moon as water and fire; the *Yi* takes Kan and Li as water and fire; Chan takes samadhi and wisdom as water and fire; the sages take clarity and moisture as water and fire; medicine takes the heart and kidneys as water and fire; the Dao of alchemy takes essence and qi as water and fire. I now clearly point out: within one’s own body, all that flames above is fire, and all that moistens below is water. Though the names vary, they are but metaphors to guide the learner toward self-realization.

**Question:** How is there water within fire?
**Answer:** From of old, divine water flows from the high plateau. In principle, water cannot moisten itself—it relies on fire’s steaming to become moist. In symbolic terms, fire flourishes at *wu*, while water receives its qi at *wu*. Thus, it is clear that water exists within fire. In the body, this is the fluid within qi.

**Question:** How is there fire within water?
**Answer:** In principle, the sun emerges from the sea. In symbolic terms, water flourishes at *zi*, while fire gestates within *zi*. In the body, this is the qi within essence.

**Question:** What is the completed crossing?
**Answer:** Water ascending and fire descending is called the completed crossing. The *Yi* says: *"Mountain below marsh—diminishing. The noble one uses this to restrain anger and suppress desire."* This is the method of the completed crossing: restraining anger causes fire to descend, and suppressing desire causes water to ascend.

**Question:** What is the uncompleted crossing?
**Answer:** Failing to restrain anger, fire blazes upward; failing to suppress desire, water sinks and dampens. The fire of ignorance rages, waves surge in the sea of suffering, and water and fire do not merge—this is called the uncompleted crossing.

**Question:** What is the merging of metal and wood?
**Answer:** When emotion returns to nature, it is called their merging. Emotion belongs to metal, and nature belongs to wood.

**Question:** What is separation?
**Answer:** When emotion pursues objects and nature follows thoughts, emotion and nature diverge—this is called separation.

**Question:** What are clarity and turbidity?
**Answer:** When the mind does not move, water returns to its source—thus it is clear. When the mind moves, water follows the current—thus it is turbid.

**Question:** What are the two eights?
**Answer:** It is the measure of one *jin*. Half a *jin* of lead, eight *liang* of mercury—though there are no true weights, the two must be balanced. Thus it is called the two eights. The alchemical texts say: *"After the first quarter and before the last quarter, the medicine is level and the fire force complete."* This compares the balance of yin and yang. It is also like the second and eighth months, when day and night are equal.

**Question:** What is bathing?
**Answer:** Washing the mind and cleansing thoughts is called bathing.

**Question:** What is the completion of the elixir?
**Answer:** When body and mind unite, spirit and qi merge, and emotion and nature become one—this is called the completion of the elixir, likened to the sacred embryo. As the immortal master said: *"When true nature arrives, it is the golden elixir—refining the four illusions into a single pellet."*

**Question:** What is nurturing the fire?

Answer: To extinguish all thoughts is nurturing the fire.

**Question:** What is shedding the embryo?
**Answer:** When there is a body beyond the body, this is called shedding the embryo.

**Question:** What is ultimate completion?
**Answer:** To become one with the Great Void is called ultimate completion.

The transformations beyond phenomena are not easily described in passing—it depends on one’s own realization.

**The Living Method of Quanzhen**
Transmitted to Disciples

A Quanzhen Daoist should practice the Way of Quanzhen. What is called *Quanzhen*? It means preserving one’s original truth. Only when essence, qi, and spirit are all whole is it called *Quanzhen*. Any deficiency renders it incomplete; any stain renders it impure.

Preserving essence can protect the body. To preserve essence, first stabilize the body—stability eliminates desire, and thus essence is whole.

Preserving qi can nourish the mind. To preserve qi, first purify the mind—purity eliminates thoughts, and thus qi is whole.

Preserving spirit can return to emptiness. To preserve spirit, first make the intention sincere—sincerity unites body and mind, returning to emptiness.

Thus, essence, qi, and spirit are the three primordial medicines; body, mind, and intention are the three primordial essentials. In learning the immortal’s method, one need not do much—simply refine the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit as the foundation of the elixir. When the three treasures gather in the Central Palace, the golden elixir is complete. Is this not easy to know? Is it difficult to practice? What is difficult to know or practice arises only from delusion and confusion.

The essentials of refining essence lie in the body. When the body is still, the tiger roars and wind arises, the dark turtle lies hidden, and primordial essence congeals.

The essentials of refining qi lie in the mind. When the mind is still, the dragon chants and clouds gather, the vermilion bird folds its wings, and primordial qi rests.

The essentials of generating spirit lie in intention. When intention is still, the two substances merge, the three primordials unite as one, and the sacred embryo forms.

The cauldron of Qian and Kun, the medicines of Kan and Li, the three primordials of the Eight Trigrams, the five phases and four images—none transcend the three words *body, mind, intention*. The ultimate attainment of *Quanzhen* lies in nothing beyond the two words *body and mind*. To depart from body and mind is to follow an external path. Yet one must not cling to body and mind either—any attachment to them becomes a burden. One must use them without being bound by them.

What I call *body and mind* are not the illusory physical body and fleshly heart, but the invisible body and mind. How to describe the invisible body and mind? *"Clouds rise from the mountain, the moon enters the heart of the waves."* The body is the pure body since time immemorial, the wondrous existence within non-being. The mind is the numinous origin before the Emperor of Form, the true non-being within being. Non-being containing being resembles Kan; being containing non-being resembles Li. The ancestral master said: *"Take the solid center of the Kan position, and transmute the yin within the Li palace. From this, it transforms into the vigorous body of Qian—hidden or soaring, all depends on the mind."*

I say that the two words *body and mind* are the ultimate attainment of *Quanzhen*—what doubt remains?

The essentials of elixir refinement lie solely in *nature and life*. To depart from nature and life is to enter side doors, clinging to one side and calling it *partial withering*. The ancestral master said: *"Spirit is nature, qi is life."* This is the meaning.

Refining qi lies in protecting the body; refining spirit lies in protecting the heart. When the body is still, the tiger roars; when the mind is still, the dragon chants. The tiger’s roar sends lead into mercury; the dragon’s chant sends mercury into lead. Lead and mercury are alternate names for Kan and Li. The yang within Kan is the supreme essence within the body; the yin within Li is the primordial qi within the mind.

Refining essence into qi begins with protecting the body; refining qi into spirit begins with protecting the heart. When the body is stable, form is firm—form firm, life is complete. When the mind is stable, spirit is whole—spirit whole, nature is complete. Body and mind unite, nature and life are whole, form and spirit are wondrous—this is called the completion of the elixir.

Refining essence into qi and qi into spirit is not yet extraordinary—why? Because there remains the subtlety of refining spirit, which is not easily spoken of lightly. What I have previously outlined of the great outline of the golden elixir—if you have the eye to see here, you will know the great matter does not lie on paper. If not, you must first know where to begin. Once you know where to begin, proceed from there. Start by refining essence; when essence abides, then refine qi; when qi stabilizes, then refine spirit; when spirit congeals, then return to emptiness. Empty it again and again, and virtue and Dao are complete.

Refining essence depends on knowing the *moment*. What is called *moment* is not the time of the clock. To fixate on time is to miss it. If one says there is no moment, how does one begin? What, after all, is to be done? Ah! The ancients said: *"When the moment arrives, the spirit knows."* The ancestral master said: *"When lead sees the birth of gui, hasten to gather it."* These words say it all.

Refining qi depends on *harmonizing and blending*. What is called *harmonizing and blending* is harmonizing the true breath and regulating the true origin. Laozi said: *"The gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth. Subtle and continuous, its use is inexhaustible."* Is this not the essential of harmonizing and blending? Today, people point to the mouth and nose as the gate of the mysterious female—this is incorrect. The mysterious female is the mechanism of heaven and earth’s opening and closing. The *Book of Changes* says: *"Closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian. Opening and closing are called change."* Opening and closing are movement and stillness. This is the meaning of Laozi’s *"its use is inexhaustible."*

The alchemical texts say: *"Exhale to connect with the root of heaven; inhale to connect with the root of earth. Exhale, and the dragon chants as clouds rise; inhale, and the tiger roars as wind stirs."* I say: *"Exhale to connect with the root of heaven; inhale to connect with the root of earth"* is *"closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian."* *"Exhale, and the dragon chants as clouds rise; inhale, and the tiger roars as wind stirs"* is *"opening and closing are called change"*—this is also the meaning of *"its use is inexhaustible."*

The mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female—is this not an error? What is called "breathing" here is the true *qi* that comes and goes without end. The oral instruction: The external yin and yang in their alternation are the external medicine. The internal interpenetration of Kan and Li is the internal medicine. The external has its operations; the internal is spontaneous. The use of essence, *qi*, and spirit has two aspects, yet their substance is one.

Regarding the external medicine: in the essence of sexual union, the first requirement is non-leakage; in the *qi* of exhalation and inhalation, it must be ever more refined. As for the spirit of thought and reflection, tranquility is paramount.

Regarding the internal medicine: Refining essence refines primordial essence—this is drawing forth the primordial yang from Kan. When primordial essence is firm, the essence of sexual union will naturally not leak. Refining *qi* refines primordial *qi*—this is replenishing the primordial yin within Li. When primordial *qi* abides, the *qi* of exhalation and inhalation will naturally not move in and out. Refining spirit refines primordial spirit—this is Kan and Li uniting in the body to form Qian. When primordial spirit congeals, the spirit of thought and reflection attains perfect stability.

Above this, there is yet the refinement of emptiness, a matter not easily spoken of lightly—its value lies in silent comprehension and heart-mind resonance. Strive on, strive on.

**On Nature and Life**
By Li Daochun Yuanfu of Dulian Qing’an Jingchanzi
Compiled by Disciple Sun’an Baochanzi Cai Zhiyi

What is *xing* (nature)? It is the primordial, supremely numinous, singular spirit. What is *ming* (life)? It is the primordial, supremely refined, singular *qi*. Essence and *xing* are the root of *ming*. The transformations of *xing* depend on the heart-mind; the transformations of *ming* depend on the body. Discernment and wisdom arise from the heart-mind; thoughts and reflections are the heart-mind’s servitude of *xing*. Actions and responses arise from the body; speech and silence, seeing and hearing are the body’s burdens upon *ming*. When *ming* bears the body’s burdens, there is birth and death. When *xing* is subjected to the heart-mind’s servitude, there is coming and going. Know then that "body" and "heart-mind" are the abode of spirit and essence, while spirit and essence are the root of *xing* and *ming*. *Xing* cannot stand without *ming*; *ming* cannot exist without *xing*. Though their names are two, their principle is one.

Alas! Today’s learners, black-robed monks, and Daoist adepts divide *xing* and *ming* into two, each clinging to one side, mutually disputing right and wrong. They do not realize that solitary yin or orphaned yang cannot accomplish the great work. Those who cultivate *ming* without understanding *xing* will not escape karmic fate; those who perceive *xing* without knowing *ming*—where will they ultimately return? The Immortal Master said: "To refine the Golden Elixir without fathoming *xing* is the foremost malady in cultivation. To refine only the true *xing* without refining the Elixir—even after ten thousand kalpas, the radiant spirit will not attain sagehood." Truly, these are weighty words.

The loftiest adepts comprehend both *xing* and *ming*: first upholding the precepts, concentration, and wisdom to empty the heart-mind; then refining essence, *qi*, and spirit to preserve the body. When the body is at peace, the foundation of *ming* is eternally firm; when the heart-mind is emptied and clarified, the root of *xing* is perfectly luminous. When *xing* is luminous, there is neither coming nor going; when *ming* is firm, there is neither death nor birth. As for merging into perfect wholeness, directly entering non-action—*xing* and *ming* are both complete, form and spirit both wondrous.

Yet one must not assert that *xing* and *ming* are originally two, nor treat them as a single matter. They are fundamentally one, but in application, they are two. If one clings to partiality and enters through a single gate, this is a failure to understand *xing* and *ming*. Failing to understand *xing* and *ming* is to sunder them into two. If *xing* and *ming* do not mutually sustain each other, how can one ascend to truth and tread the celestial realms?

**On the Symbolism of Hexagrams**
The Perfected One Haiqiong said: "The highest-grade elixir method requires no hexagrams or lines." Why then do all elixir texts employ hexagrams and lines? This is the Sage’s pedagogical device to reveal the Dao. As the ancients said: "The Great Dao is wordless; without words, its Dao cannot be revealed." This is the meaning.

The term "hexagram" (*gua*) means "to hang." Like hanging an object in empty space to display it to others, or as heaven suspends images to show fortune and misfortune, making them easily visible. "Image" (*xiang*) means "to resemble this"; "line" (*yao*) means "to emulate this." A hexagram of three lines symbolizes the Three Powers—these are one’s Three Origins. A hexagram of six lines symbolizes the Six Voids—these are one’s Six Harmonies. Elixir texts use hexagrams and lines to guide practitioners in modeling the furnace, following the lines to advance the fire, and easily establishing standards.

When the Perfected One Haiqiong spoke of "no hexagrams or lines," he was warning later generations not to become fixated on line symbols—using them while transcending them. For example, before this body was born, it was quiescent and unmoving, like the ode to the undivided Supreme Ultimate. With the arising of this body, *xing* and *ming* are established—this is the Supreme Ultimate generating the Two Modes. With form comes *xing* and temperament—this is the Two Modes generating the Four Images. As for spirit, *hun*, *po*, intention, *qi*, body, and heart-mind—all are fully possessed—this is the Four Images generating the Eight Trigrams.

The ancients said: "If names are not released, then in the Palace of Li, cultivate concentration; returning to the Dao, seek the mysterious in the Water Mansion." This refers to the essentials of refining *xing* and *ming*. "Cultivating concentration in the Palace of Li" means upholding precepts, concentration, and wisdom, so that all dust does not adhere and the myriad things are empty—this is removing the yin within Li. "Seeking the mysterious in the Water Mansion" means refining essence, *qi*, and spirit, so that the Three Flowers gather in the tripod, the Five *Qi* return to the origin, and the yang within Kan is preserved.

The profoundly enlightened adept holds both principles together: embracing yin while carrying yang, emptying the heart-mind and filling the abdomen—this is extracting the yang within Kan to replenish the yin within Li, thereby re-forming the Qian body. The Perfected One Ziyang said:
*"Take the solid center from Kan’s position,
To transmute the yin within Li’s palace.
From this, transform into Qian’s vigorous body—
Concealment and soaring are all at the heart’s command."*
This is precisely the meaning.

In employing hexagrams and lines for fire phases, the two hexagrams Qian and Kun—vigorous and yielding—mutually interact, advancing and retreating to determine the four seasons and complete the year. The four virtues operate and transform without end. The progression and retreat of fire, the extraction and addition, increase and decrease—all are modeled upon them. A year is condensed into a month, a month into a day, a day into an hour, an hour into a *ke*, a *ke* into a single breath. From the vastness of cosmic eras and kalpas to the subtlety of a single breath, each has a complete cycle of movement. Those who grasp this principle have attained the essentials of advancing fire and withdrawing the tally.

Yet in the Dao of the Elixir, hexagrams are used for the method, and lines for the fire phases—all are metaphors. One must not cling to hexagrams and lines. Know that to cross a river, one needs a raft; upon reaching the shore, the boat is no longer needed. Having caught the fish, forget the trap; having snared the hare, forget the snare. The Perfected One Ziyang said:
*"Within this, grasp the meaning and cease seeking images;
To exhaust the lines is but to labor the emotions."*
And again:
*"Without carving time to divide midnight and noon,
Within the hexagrams and lines, Qian and Kun are determined."*
Both refer to this.

I say: those born with knowledge obtain it without seeking, hitting the mark without effort—how could they rely on inducements and metaphors? Thus, the highest-grade elixir method does not employ hexagrams or lines. For those of middling and lesser capacity who cannot directly comprehend, gradual entry is necessary.

Thus, all alchemical texts take hexagrams and lines as their method—those who comprehend savor them and attain realization on their own.

On life and death, the Most High said: *"People treat death lightly because they cling so deeply to life; it is for this reason they treat death lightly."* And again: *"Only those who do not prize life are wiser than those who value it."* This means that when one seeks life, it cannot be grasped—how then could death exist? Where there is life, there is death; without death, there is no life. Thus, in the great matter of nature and destiny, life and death are of utmost weight. To know death, one must first know life; knowing life, one naturally knows death. Zilu asked about death, and the Master said: *"If you do not yet understand life, how can you understand death?"* How profound the words of the Sage! The *Xici* speaks of *"tracing beginnings to grasp endings"*—does this not refer to the discourse on life and death?

I say: those who study the Dao, if they wish to grasp the end, must first trace the beginning; if they wish to clarify the final outcome, they must thoroughly examine the present. If one is free and unburdened now, one will be free and unburdened at the end; if one is liberated now, one will be liberated at the end. From ancient times to the present, the sages of all ages who shed their mortal forms and transformed through spirit, responding to change without end—this is because they had previously refined themselves to purity, and thus at the end could ascend lightly. If there is one who, in ordinary circumstances, sees through every realm and penetrates it thoroughly, is not deluded by phenomena, and is not ensnared by conditions, then at the end no realm can delude him, and no condition can bind him.

I see that those who meditate today, the moment they close their eyes, all manner of illusory and demonic visions appear before them. Once they enter these demonic realms, they become one with the yin demons, unaware of themselves. Even if some awaken, they cannot dispel them, becoming like a corpse with breath—possessing all six senses yet unable to act, tossed and disturbed without respite. If one is not free now, how can one be free at the shore of life and death? Only a resolute person, whether their eyes are open or closed, remains the same, untainted by any illusory realm, coming and going without attachment, attaining great freedom. If one is free and unburdened now, why fear not being so at the end?

Master Qing’an, not sparing his two flaps of skin, expounds for the likes of Sun’an: the work you do now is the great matter of the end; the present is the cause, the end is the effect. All thoughts and concerns now belong to the yin realm; all illusory conditions are demonic realms. If in ordinary times you can sweep them clean, at the end you will not be confused by them. Thoughts should be dispelled by principle; illusions should be severed by resolve. When thoughts cease, yin dissipates; when illusions vanish, demons perish, and yang arises. With long accumulation, yin is exhausted and yang is pure—this is called immortality. But if thoughts multiply and conditions arise, following desires and indulging them, then yin grows and demons flourish, and yang diminishes. With long accumulation, yang is exhausted and yin is pure—this is death.

A great cultivator whose share of yin is not yet exhausted does not become immortal. An ordinary person whose share of yang is not yet exhausted does not die. Those who hold this view—the lofty adepts of the Mystery Gate and the assembly of Dharma—firmly resolve, maintain unwavering faith, and directly sweep clean, making themselves utterly bare and empty, allowing not even a speck of dust to cling. This is the pure Dharmakāya.

If you do not cling to any form, then no form clings to you;
If you do not stain yourself with any dharma, then no dharma grasps you;
If you do not see any thing, then no thing sees you;
If you do not know any affair, then no affair knows you;
If you do not hear any sound, then no sound hears you;
If you do not engage any perception, then no perception engages you.
The five aggregates and six consciousnesses are likewise so.

When the six dusts do not enter, the six senses are pure; when the five aggregates are empty, the five eyes are perfectly clear. At this stage, the six senses intermingle and function as one, the whole body becomes an eye, all yin is exhausted, and the entire being is pure yang. Nature and destiny are both preserved, form and spirit are both wondrous, and one merges with the true Dao. What life and death is there to transcend? What present and end remains? Without cause, without effect, without existence, without nonexistence—how vast the lightness, how great the freedom! Ah, the wonder of the patience of the unborn Dharma is fully realized here.

Written on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the renchen year of the Zhiyuan era, by Qing’an Yingchanzi at Zhonghe Hermitage, for Cai Sun’an and others.

On movement and stillness, the Most High said: *"Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly; as the myriad things arise together, I observe their return."* This speaks of stillness reaching its extreme and then moving. *"The ten thousand things flourish, each returning to its root; returning to the root is called stillness—this is called restoring destiny."* This speaks of movement reaching its extreme and returning to stillness. And again: *"Restoring destiny is called constancy."* This means that stillness moves and movement is still—this is the constancy of the Dao. If one takes movement as movement and stillness as stillness, that is the constancy of things.

The former worthies said: *"Stillness moves, movement is still—this is spirit; movement without stillness, stillness without movement—this is matter."* Does this not refer to this? Thus, in preserving body and mind, nothing surpasses movement and stillness. Those who study the Dao gather body and mind, attain utmost emptiness, and guard stillness firmly—then they can observe return. The *Book of Changes* says: *"Return—is this not the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s heart?"* The hexagram *Fu* (Return) arises from *Kun* (Receptive) and is stillness moving. Five yin lines are utterly still, and one yang moves below—this is called *Fu*. Is this not stillness reaching its extreme and then moving? Observing return, one knows transformation; knowing transformation, one is not transformed; not being transformed, one returns to the root.

Returning to the root is called stillness—this is known as the restoration of life. Is this not movement returning to stillness?

The *Book of Changes*’ *Xici* states: *"Closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian. The alternation of closing and opening is called change; the ceaseless coming and going is called penetration."* The alternation of closing and opening is the alternation of movement and stillness. Ceaseless coming and going is the unceasing of movement and stillness. Interacting movement and stillness, the mechanism endlessly operates—this is called transformation. Extending and enacting it, responding to change without end—this is called penetration.

The *Daodejing* says: *"The valley spirit does not die—this is called the mysterious female."* This speaks of emptiness and numinous clarity, where the mechanism of movement and stillness cannot be concealed. It further states: *"The gate of the mysterious female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth."* This refers to Qian’s yang and Kun’s yin, the alternation of closing and opening that generates transformation. It also says: *"Subtle and ever-present, its use is inexhaustible."* This is the ceaseless coming and going called penetration.

The root of Heaven opens and closes like a person’s breath. Exhaling connects to the root of Heaven—this is called opening; inhaling connects to the root of Earth—this is called closing. Exhaling, the dragon chants and clouds arise; inhaling, the tiger roars and wind stirs—this is called transformation. Wind and clouds converge, dragon and tiger intertwine, movement and stillness mutually arise—manifest and subtle are seamless—this is called penetration.

What I call breath is not that of the mouth and nose, but the ceaseless, subtle flow of true breath. If one clings to the mouth and nose as the mysterious female, how can one fully grasp the divine dance of Heaven and Earth? Those who understand Heaven and Earth’s transformations and the workings of the spirit are called superior scholars. Those who comprehend this principle know that Qian’s Way is strong and unceasing—just as the heart moves without contrivance, ceaseless in effort. Kun’s Way is receptive and nurturing—just as the body is still and responds to things, its use inexhaustible.

The heart models Heaven and thus is clear; the body models Earth and thus is still. Abiding in clarity and stillness, the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s opening and closing is maintained by me. The classic states: *"Clarity is the source of turbidity; movement is the foundation of stillness. If one can abide in constant clarity and stillness, Heaven and Earth wholly return."* This speaks precisely of this.

The disciples of Jingxian An inquired of me about the essentials of preserving body and mind. I answered them with movement and stillness, intending that they gather body and mind and emulate the functions of Heaven and Earth. Preserving the body lies in harmonizing; preserving the heart lies in restraint. Harmonizing values movement; restraint values stillness. Movement emulates Heaven; stillness emulates Earth. When body and heart are both still, Heaven and Earth unite.

At the extreme of stillness, the true mechanism naturally and wondrously responds—this is no ordinary movement. This very mechanism of movement is the heart of Heaven. Once the heart of Heaven is revealed, the mysterious pass opens. Once the mysterious pass opens, the medicine and ingredients are here, the crucible and furnace are here, the firing times are here. The Three Origins, Eight Trigrams, Four Images, and Five Phases—all operations are fully contained within.

At this stage of practice, body and heart merge, movement and stillness mutually require each other, and the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s opening and closing is entirely within me. When the heart returns to emptiness and quiescence, the body enters non-action, movement and stillness are both forgotten, essence congeals and qi transforms.

Here, essence naturally transforms into qi, qi naturally transforms into spirit, spirit naturally transforms into emptiness, merging with the Great Void as one—this is called returning to the root and restoring the origin. Ah! The Way of longevity and enduring vision is fully realized here.

Written on the fourth day after the Lantern Festival of the renchen year of the Zhiyuan era, by Yingchanzi of Qing’an at the Zhonghe Retreat, for the disciples of Jingxian An.

*Song: "Hymn to the Original Dao" – Gift to Yeyun*

If the mysterious stream truly penetrates the Mysterious Pass,
Treading the luminous path to attain the Real is not difficult.
It is only these star-like apertures—
Yet they delude people as if separated by ten thousand mountains.

Though the world may have those who seek the Golden Elixir,
Most cling to texts and cling to things.
Though they toil with bitter resolve within the teachings,
They are like foolish cats guarding empty burrows.

Some take minerals as the Mother of the Elixir,
Some say the mouth and nose are the Mysterious Female.
Some claim the heart and kidneys are Kan and Li,
Some say essence and blood are the wondrous pair.

They exhaust form and torment the body, wasting spirit—
The subtle root is fragmented, the Dao does not unfold.
Only when the numinous source is utterly lost
Do they still cling, refusing to turn back.

Yet each person possesses the essentials of longevity,
The Dao’s methods are available to all—yet none resemble it.
Floating vanities confuse the eyes—who returns the light?
Thin mists entangle the heart—who reflects inward?

I observe Yeyun of Yingchuan—
Marvelous! He has mastered both Dao and Buddha.
Jade locks and golden shackles are all cast off,
Swiftly retreating from the torrent, he reveres the Mysterious Wind.

Now that I have found a friend who knows the melody,
I reveal all the celestial mechanisms without reserve:
Within the Kan Water lies a speck of gold—
Hasten to unite it with the heart of Li.

A single phrase of the Dao-heart I share with you, worthy one:
From now on, cease your scattered inquiries.
For nine summers, simply observe the dragon drawing water—
The bright decree of Heaven clearly reveals the true meaning.

Grasp this mechanism and know how to gather the medicine:
Where the earth-thunder quakes, the bellows and pipes resound.
In an instant, clouds and rain gather in great mist,
All qi converges—true bliss!

From the water, the elusive Jade Toad is obtained,
Placed within the suspended womb-crucible for storage.
Advancing fire and retreating tally—when the work is complete,
From nothingness, being arises, and the Mysterious Pearl is formed.

Yet obtaining the Mysterious Pearl is not yet the ultimate marvel—
Refining the spirit and nurturing it remains profoundly subtle.
Lead must run, mercury must fly,
Water fears cold, fire fears dryness.

In tending the fire, one must know how to hold fullness;
When stillness settles, the Three Primes coalesce into the Great Treasure.
Breaking through the crown gate, the spirit sheds its husk—
Together we shall ascend to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones.

*Song of Refining Emptiness, with Preface*

The root of the Dao is utter emptiness;
From emptiness and nothingness, qi is born.
When the One Qi divides, the Two Modes stand forth:
That which is clear and ascends is called Heaven,
That which is turbid and descends is called Earth.

Heaven is round and moves—
The Northern Asterism does not shift, for it governs motion.
Earth is square and still—
The Eastern Flow does not cease, for it governs stillness.

The Northern Asterism is the heart of Heaven and Earth,
The Eastern Flow is the qi of Heaven and Earth.
Nurture the heart with emptiness, so the heart may be still;
Nurture qi with emptiness, so qi may circulate.

When the human heart is at peace and still,
Like the Northern Asterism’s unshifting, the spirit is utterly empty and numinous.
Those who attain this vision hold the Heavenly Dao within themselves.
When qi constantly moves,
Like the Eastern Flow’s unceasing, the form is firmly preserved.
Those who attain this vision hold the Earthly Dao within themselves.

When the Dao of Heaven and Earth is within oneself,
Form and spirit are both wondrous,
Yin and yang cannot be altered or displaced—
One transcends beyond the workings of creation.

Thus, emptiness is the body of the Great Dao,
The beginning of Heaven and Earth.
From it arise movement and stillness,
Through it yin and yang revolve,
From it all things are born.
Therefore, emptiness is the great root of all under Heaven.

The noble scholar Wang of Hangzhou named his studio after bamboo,
For he drew inspiration from this principle.
In affairs, he acted with integrity;
In the world, he moved with compliance;
In the heart, he cultivated gentleness;
In the body, he maintained stillness—
These are the moral principles of bamboo.

In action, he forgot emotion;
In stillness, he forgot thought;
Responding to opportunity, he forgot the self;
Adapting to change, he forgot things—
This is the inner emptiness of bamboo.

He established resolute determination,
Maintained unwavering faith,
Harmonized inner and outer,
Remained unchanging from beginning to end—
This is the winter endurance of bamboo.

He broadly sought the company of the wise,
Visited enlightened teachers far and wide,
Received wandering monks with cloud and water,
And harmonized the Three Teachings—
This is the grove of bamboo.

Moreover, he embraced simplicity and held to plainness,
Reduced selfishness and curbed desires,
Regulated breath and cultivated sincerity,
Observed transformations and knew renewal—
Who but one who attains the utmost emptiness under Heaven could achieve this?
Thus, naming his studio after bamboo was most fitting.

In the xinmao year, a Quanzhen Daoist came to the Zhonghe Retreat in Jinling.
He spoke of profound virtue, and I deeply esteemed him.
Thereafter, he visited three times by cloud-chariot.
Observing his words, I saw his aspiration for emptiness and tranquility.
Thus, on the Double Yang Festival of the jihai year, I soared across the void on a flying sword to visit the master.
Examining his conduct and scrutinizing his speech,
I saw that he had deeply penetrated the Mysterious Principle.
Therefore, I bestowed upon him the name *Juechan* (Paired Toads).

The character *jue* consists of two jades joined together,
Enabling the interflow of emptiness and fullness—
The great method for preserving form and spirit in their entirety.
Emptiness is the body of fullness, fullness is the function of emptiness;
When emptiness and fullness interflow, coming and going are unimpeded.

Jade also embodies the meaning of purity and whiteness:
Within an empty chamber, whiteness arises,
The spirit’s dwelling is profoundly settled,
And naturally, the light of Heaven shines forth,
Illuminating all without partiality.
When the work reaches this point,
The tasks of immortals, buddhas, and sages are complete.

Having spoken thus, I compose this piece to record it.
The song goes:

To be immortal, buddha, or Confucian sage—
The three teachings transmit but one emptiness.
From ancient times to now, all who transcend
Have cultivated within this void.

Those who study immortality take emptiness and stillness as the elixir’s core,
Those who study Buddhism plumb the void in meditation.
As for me, learning the sagely way—
In emptiness, the self dissolves, and Heaven’s principle shines clear.

The Dao’s body is an empty vastness, wondrous and boundless,
Heaven and Earth operate through emptiness, qi harmoniously fuses.
Yin and Yang’s transformations are driven by the void’s ebb and flow;
If one delves into emptiness, all becomes fluid and free.

The marvel of the returning elixir lies in the valley of nothingness—
Begin by attaining emptiness, steadfastly guard stillness.
Push emptiness to its extreme, and primordial qi congeals;
Stillness deepened further, yang revives in turn.

An empty heart and full belly are the Dao’s foundation,
When the numinous void is not obscured, it is time to gather the medicine.
Emptying the self to respond to the moment is true daily practice,
One who embodies the Great Void is a child of the heroic.

Gathering lead in emptiness and stillness is effortless action,
Advancing the fire uses emptiness as the bellows’ key.
All additions and subtractions arise from emptiness,
Shattering the void completes the Great Learning.

Ultimately, the Dao is empty yet inexhaustibly active—
To resolve entanglements and blunt sharpness, both must be embraced.
Knowing the light, one blends with the world, forgetting self and others;
Before the image of the Lord, only the self knows.

Before the uncarved, how could there be trigrams?
Qian is not above, Kun is not below.
At the center, a single point of utmost emptiness and numinosity,
Eight-sided and flawless, without seam or crack.

Though its four edges are firmly sealed, it pierces the undifferentiated whole—
This is the Mysterious Female’s gate of central emptiness.
If one seeks to employ emptiness without first becoming empty,
Naturally, opening and closing will align with Heaven and Earth.

When the Mysterious Female’s gate opens, the work reaches its peak,
From this the spirit emerges, to this it returns.
Emerging and entering, it reverts to emptiness—
Suddenly, a spring thunderclap shakes the earth.

When the thunderclap resounds, Heaven and Earth part,
From the void bursts forth a perfect wheel of light.
Round and full, its radiance vast,
Lacking nothing, excess nothing, it illumines all equally.

This master of the bamboo’s uprightness is extraordinary—
Grasp it subtly to respond to all things in season.
Within emptiness, settle the spirit; within emptiness, act.
In speech, reveal the void’s subtle workings.

When emptiness reaches its ultimate, all errors cease,
Abiding in emptiness, Heaven and Earth return in full.
The hollow-hearted, straight-stemmed green bamboo—
This is the foremost mechanism of refining emptiness.

*Song of Breaking Delusion*

Alas for the gold elixir seekers of the world,
Their methods diverge, their cinnabar varies endlessly.
Clinging to images, mired in texts, what can they achieve?
Plucking leaves, chasing branches—all in vain.

They gather the sun’s essence, absorb the moon’s radiance,
Contain light, ingest qi, and swallow mist.
Crouching and stretching, they busy themselves needlessly,
Rolling their eyes, pinching their lids, conjuring empty flowers.

They refine thick saliva, swallow fluids,
Press the tailbone, clench the spine.
Visualizing, contemplating, gazing at the tip of the nose,
They churn seas and overturn oceans, consuming filth.

They guard blandness, sink into dull emptiness,
Stupefied and dazed, they rush through their practice.
Some add massage and breath-counting—
All far removed from the principle of the gold elixir.

Eight Brocades, Six Healing Sounds,
Fasting and grain-avoidance—what do these accomplish?
Clinging to the Three Peaks, they study yin-cultivation,
Nine shallow thrusts, one deep—such is their advance and retreat.

They stir the waist, cup the kidneys, guard the Gate of Life,
Bend and stretch, guide and lead, playing with essence and spirit.
Facing the furnace, consuming milk, mimicking military strategy—
Such family traditions are not worth discussing.

Some practice turtle-retraction and breath-holding,
Bear-stretching and crow-flying—all futile labor.
The "Rubbing Waist Layman" warms his belly,
The "Qi-Circulating Master" reddens his face.

They strike the Heavenly Drum, embrace Kunlun,
Knock their teeth, gather their spirit, gaze at the crown.
Hearing echoes, they mistake them for a roaring tiger,
When their bellies gurgle, they claim it is the female dragon’s song.

They burn the cinnabar field, chant over boiling seas,
Sleepless day and night, enduring bitter trials.
Barefoot and in thin clothes, they suffer torment,
Repaying debts of hunger and cold from past lives.

Constantly maintaining silence is but futile effort,
Silently worshipping the Emperor—how can one ascend?
Exhaling into their hands, clutching their bags—true vulgar lords,
Rubbing their urine—how mad and deranged.

They wield the golden spear, draw from the golden well,
Using beautiful women as their medicine crucibles.
They gather others’ essence and blood, calling it true lead,
Losing their primordial harmony, yet still unaware.

Some spout Chan like tangled vines,
Wagging their tongues, showing off their eloquence.
Pointing to emptiness, expounding on emptiness, they brawl,
Raising fists, thrusting fingers—ignorant of the source.

They raise "critical phrases," observe methods,
Wielding quick wit and sharp repartee, clamoring over texts.
Brandishing hammers, flourishing whisk brooms, they recruit disciples,
Blinking their eyes, raising their brows—this is their "transmission."

Studying cases, pursuing Chan,
True high monks would never act thus.
Many paths to reason are called wisdom,
But "seeing the nature" must wait for the donkey’s year.

Daoists, Confucians, Buddhists—abandon your clinging,
Turn the light inward, reflect, and measure yourself.
Suddenly, you touch the tip of your nose—
Only then will you realize all that came before was wrong.

Students of immortality, cease your chatter,
Trace the breath’s origin to its root.
Discard all forms and seeking,
Avoid even the formless and imageless.

The heart is not fire, the kidneys are not water,
Ordinary essence cannot be called Heavenly Water.
The Yellow Dame is not in the spleen,
The Mysterious Female is not in the mouth or nose.

Mao is not the rabbit, You is not the rooster,
Zi is not Kan, Wu is not Li.
The First, Second, Third, and Fourth are not in the intestines,
Holding to fullness—why cling to the moon’s fullness?

The liver is not the dragon, the lungs are not the tiger,
How can essence and radiance be called the elixir’s mother?
The Five Phases are but one Yin and Yang,
The Four Images do not depart from the Two Mysterious Females.

The source of the medicine’s river is not easily known,
Mercury arises in the East, lead in the West.
The sun’s soul in the Li position is the Alchemical Girl,
The moon’s spirit in the Kan palace is the Infant Boy.

Act without acting, learn without learning,
Pratyeka-buddhas and Sravakas all rely on this.
I now reveal the entire mechanism in one phrase:
Body and mind are both fire and medicine.

When body and mind are settled, the mysterious aperture opens,
Essence, qi, and spirit naturally merge in emptiness.
After three hundred days, the fetal spirit sheds its husk,
Turning the body, it shatters the Great Void.

*Two Songs of the Mysterious Principle*

Though the Supreme Dao has no fixed abode,
It still relies on a master to transmit its rules.
Zhun and Meng take their images from dawn and dusk,
Fu and Gou borrow winter and summer, calling them Zi and Wu.

Advance the fire within nothingness to refine the Great Elixir,
Set the furnace and stabilize the cauldron to seek true earth.
Body, mind, and intent—three households united,
Lead, mercury, silver, and cinnabar share one origin.

Additions and subtractions follow the poem’s order,
Guarding the city, I distinguish host and guest.

The Red Child of South Mountain rides the Azure Dragon,
The Metal Elder of North Sea mounts the White Tiger.
These two medicines blend in perfect fusion,
A pair of tortoise and serpent naturally inhale and exhale.

Directly transcending the actual to return to the Great Vehicle,
Sudden enlightenment and perfect penetration are no small aid.
The secret meeting of the true mechanism is inherently natural—
Pity those petty methods that vainly prop themselves up.
With clever tongues and eloquent speech they boast of skill,
Arrogant in qi and haughty in heart—who dares challenge them?
Before learning to settle the mind into profound darkness,
Why trouble oneself with lofty aspirations in the garden’s walls?

Beginners naturally refuse to seek a master,
Yet in old age, having achieved nothing, they endure suffering.
Accumulating merit and piling up deeds to fill three thousand,
They reflect inward and turn their light back to exhaust the two and five.
The fire rises in the east as the tiger roars in the wind,
The dragon moves through rain, sweeping dust at the western extreme.
Commanding thunder and lightning, they employ the celestial stems,
Aiding the upright and expelling evil, the Dark Warrior takes its task.

The Enchanting Maiden has just left the Purple Ultimate Palace,
The Metal Elder has already arrived at the Vermilion Mound.
Within the furnace, the great medicine forms as a single pill,
In the chamber, the fetal immortal dances in triple rhythm.
The four images and five phases all harmonize,
The nine returns and seven reversals complete their universal work.

The bright toad emerges from its hermitage,
Its radiant light filling the vast universe.
To govern people and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality—
Frugality is called the weighty accumulation of virtue.
The nature of Heaven is vast, yet it deeply examines the roots of dust,
The paths of principle are many, yet they increase karmic consciousness.
A heart bright with wisdom is no match for simplicity,
Grand eloquence and lofty discourse vie in vain with silence.

Cut off thoughts, forget schemes, and be free of right and wrong,
Conceal brilliance, contain splendor, and distance yourself from sound and color.
With few desires and plain flavors, good roots reach fulfillment,
Reducing affairs and simplifying ties, the root of virtue is planted.
A single thought fuses with the myriad voids, all clarified,
The three minds are refined, and all conditions cease.

Carefully observe the books of the sages of the Three Teachings—
The word "cessation" is the simplest and most direct.
If you cultivate effort on cessation,
To become Buddha or immortal requires no labor.
Cessation of conditions reveals the root—Chan’s mechanism,
Cessation of the heart illuminates principle—Confucianism’s ultimate.
Cessation of breath congeals spirit—Daoism’s mystery,
These three cessations support one another, and nothing is not overcome.

I speak to Zhitang and Tian Jiaochan:
Ultimately, one’s own mind is the rule and measure.

*Song of Nature and Principle*

The Two Modes first divided into the Three Ultimates,
Qian is upright and steadfast, Kun opens and closes.
Between Heaven and Earth lies the Mysterious Female’s gate,
The more it moves, the more it emerges; the more it is still, the more it enters.
The orthodox transmission of the Dao points to the return,
Confucius taught Zengzi, Zengzi taught Ziyu.
Wind follows the tiger as clouds follow the dragon,
Fire seeks dryness as water flows to moisture.

To harmonize and investigate things follows a proper order,
To enter sagehood and transcend the ordinary has no steps.
The noble person dwells in ease to await destiny,
Inwardly examining and finding no fault, what worry or sorrow remains?
To extend application and clarify the mechanisms of life and death,
Preserving the body ultimately depends on the hibernation of dragon and serpent.

Turn the light back to illuminate the dreamlike body,
Directly overturn the old volumes of scripture.
Polish away the dust and scrape off the grime to sever the roots of dust,
Release burdens and purify the heart, free from defiling habits.
Settle the mind into subtlety, and through resonance, it penetrates—
The ten thousand miles of the Yangtze River are swallowed in a single gulp.
Why need the Qian cauldron to refine golden essence?
No need for the Kun furnace to simmer jade nectar.

Thoroughly penetrating before Fuxi drew the trigrams,
The world is gathered and hidden within a millet grain.

*Song of Fire Phases*

To forge the mysterious within the mysterious, one must be vigilant in solitude,
The work of vigilance in solitude lies in the mechanism of the eye.
Sever all ties to sensory dust, free from slander or disgrace,
The square inch of the heart becomes clear and empty, gleaming like jade.
Push emptiness to its utmost, guard stillness with sincerity,
Within stillness, a single movement—yang returns.
The first nine: the hidden dragon must be restrained,
Advance to the "seeing dragon" but do not rush too quickly.

As soon as "vigilant and tireless" shines within,
It may leap or rest in the abyss—this is the time of bathing.
The nine five: the flying dragon achieves transformation and nurturing,
Yang at its peak, yin arises—one must retreat.
Guard against the subtle and block the gradual at Kun’s initial six,
Retreat to "upright and square," metal and wood conjoin.
The six three: do not be honored with emolument,
After "tying the sack," the divine elixir ripens.
If you encounter wild battles, restrain your ambition,
Yin eroded, yang pure—the fire phase is complete.

A single precious pearl is swallowed into the belly,
Becoming a complete immortal and celestial kin.
One husband and one wife ever in harmony,
The three pairs and three oddities follow in timely pursuit.
The Plain Girl and Azure Lad rest together,
Black mercury and red lead naturally gather.
The void constructs a dwelling of non-action,
This master is truly extraordinary.

Mountains conceal clouds, Heaven and Earth grow solemn,
The radiant toad’s light illuminates the empty valley.

*Song of Dragon and Tiger with Preface*

Dragon and tiger are alternate names for yin and yang.
The transformations of yin and yang are wondrous and unfathomable,
Thus they are symbolized by dragon and tiger.
The *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* says:
"One yin and one yang are called the Dao; yin and yang unfathomable are called spirit."
The alchemical texts say: "Partial yin or partial yang is called illness."
Yin and yang are the movement and stillness of the Great Ultimate.
Divided into two, the clear ascends and the turbid sinks;
Vast as Heaven and Earth, small as all things,
All receive the two qi of yin and yang and take form and name.
Thus, between the covering and bearing,
From the most minute to the most vast,
Nothing lies outside the course of yin and yang.

The alchemical classics and philosophical texts,
With their myriad alternate names,
Do not exceed the two words yin and yang.
The immortals of past ages,
Using metaphors and establishing symbols,
Compared them to dragon and tiger,
So that students could easily grasp the pattern and succeed.

The images of dragon and tiger,
Endlessly transforming, wondrous and inexhaustible,
Are thus compared to medicines,
Established as the furnace and cauldron,
Operated as fire phases,
Compared to kan and li,
Borrowed as metal and wood,
Named as male and female,
Paired as husband and wife.
These alternate names all express the wondrous functions of dragon and tiger.

By their numinous responsiveness, they are called medicines;
By their ability to form things, they are called furnace and cauldron;
By their transformations, they are called fire phases;
By their mutual assistance, they are called kan and li;
By their hardness and straightness, they are called metal and wood;
By their rising and sinking, they are called male and female;
By their wondrous union, they are called husband and wife.
Without dragon and tiger, how could these be fully expressed?

The *Wenyan* says: "Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger; when the sage arises, the myriad things observe."
This elucidates the virtue of Qian’s nine five.
Thus, the wondrousness of dragon and tiger—
Without divine virtue and sagely achievement, how could one be worthy of them?

Turning inward to seek, this is the nature of one’s feelings and essence;
Transforming and cultivating them, this is body and mind, soul and spirit, essence and qi.
Extending and practicing this, it is the gate of the Mysterious Female, the mechanism of opening and closing.

The *Taishang* says: "The valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth." Subtly continuous, as if present—its use is inexhaustible.

The *Yi* says: "Closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian. One closing and one opening is called change; ceaseless coming and going is called penetration."

The *Elixir Scripture* says: "Exhaling connects to the root of Heaven; inhaling connects to the root of Earth—this is the mechanism of Qian and Kun’s opening and closing. Exhaling, the dragon hums and clouds arise; inhaling, the tiger roars and wind is born—this is one closing and one opening called change. Wind and clouds respond and unite, transforming to generate the golden liquid—this is ceaseless coming and going called penetration. The golden liquid returns, congealing into the Great Elixir, hence provisionally named the Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir. Gathering and ingesting it, one attains longevity and enduring vision—this so-called breathing is not that of mouth and nose. The true mechanism’s wondrous response is the gate of one emergence and one entry. If you can penetrate this, the Dragon-Tiger Elixir will form, and immortality may be hoped for.

Those who cultivate the truth, if they can thoroughly master and fully penetrate the Dragon and Tiger, though the Way of true constancy is called most profound and subtle, how could they fear failure? As for planting good roots, establishing virtue’s foundation, and nurturing the sacred embryo, none have succeeded without clarifying the Dragon and Tiger.

Master Ziyang said: "Gathering body and mind is called subduing the Dragon and Tiger. When the mind is unmoving, the dragon hums; when the body is unmoving, the tiger roars. The dragon’s humming consolidates qi; the tiger’s roaring congeals essence. When primordial essence congeals, it suffices to preserve form; when primordial qi is consolidated, it suffices to concentrate spirit. When form and spirit are both wondrous, they unite with the Dao in truth—thus the immortal’s task is complete. If not one of utmost spirit in the world, who could attain this?"

Zhao Shuzhai, a native of ancient Hangzhou, served as a eunuch in his youth, holding the office of palace attendant. Through the turning of Qian and the revolving of Kun, he saw through the illusions of floating life, thus abandoning profit and renouncing fame to seek the essentials of the Dao. Though he mingled in the red dust, his heart dwelled in the realm of mystery—a true transcender of worldly affairs. Desiring to blend and congeal spirit, he focused his mind on the Dragon and Tiger. One day, he brought this diagram to me, asking for an inscription. I declined, but he insisted, so I took up my brush to fulfill my duty.

I said to him: "The ancients established images based on the Dao; you now establish words based on images. Zhao Shuzhai, the key lies in sharpening your discernment, observing the teachings’ precision, and not mistaking the fixed pole star. If you can grasp the meaning through words and comprehend the intent through the diagram, you will know that the true Dragon and true Tiger are not on paper but within yourself. When words and images are both forgotten, virtue and the Dao are complete."

Ah! The true Dragon and true Tiger are not hard to find—just draw forth yang to supplement yin. With the Four Virtues circulating Qian without cease, hidden flight and manifest leaping are all at the heart’s command. Though it begins on level ground, it surges like waves in the blue sky, resounding like thunder.

Strive on, strive on!

*Song:*
...

The true Dragon and true Tiger originally have no form—
who then devised a model to transmit this pattern?
If you grasp them within the formless,
you fall into rigid duality, forever reckless and wild.

Green and white, too distinct and clear—
this is but waves rising without wind.
If one would know the true Dragon and Tiger,
they belong neither to being nor non-being, nor to the axis of zi and wu.
Do not confuse the two and swallow them whole;
simply reverse the count of the Five Phases.
Root and sprout dwell in the Palace of Great Mystery,
while creation unfolds in the Crimson Numinous Treasury.
Though their operation has a guiding principle,
in truth, the numinous void has no fixed abode.
A single great Dao demands the heart’s penetration;
a trace of divine mechanism is not seen by the eye.
Suddenly, the crown gate opens—
you discern that Wood and Metal share one mother.
Lofty, beyond the highest peak, the Big Dipper’s handle is broken;
bright, the Silver River’s ladle pours forth.
Clouds rise and mists form through Ding’s power;
lightning flashes and thunder is driven by the Dark Warrior’s might.
In an instant, Heaven and Earth unite;
in a moment, Kan and Li are mended.
The Tiger stirs a pure breeze from water’s depths;
the Dragon descends sweet rain from fire’s midst.
Thunder moves, rain falls, the world is at peace—
the Dragon’s virtue circulates Qian, its merit universally bestowed.

People say six dragons bear the heavens,
but who knows the one Dragon is the true sovereign?
People say five tigers pierce the Mysterious Pass,
but who knows the one Tiger arises from true earth?
When you grasp that Dragon and Tiger are ever in harmony,
you will see the Tortoise and Serpent mutually devour and disgorge.

The sage sets forth images to point to the snare’s trace;
beyond images, clear words become mere chatter.
Beyond words, you must fathom the ancestral intent—
in truth, the Great Ultimate was originally without mark.
To grasp the meaning and forget the image is not yet exceptional;
only when meaning too is forgotten do you reach the ultimate norm.

I bow to Zhao Shuzhai, the recluse—
having thoroughly overturned all, his study of the mysteries is complete.

*Song of No-One:*
The Dao, fundamentally formless, gives birth to the Great Ultimate;
the Great Ultimate transforms, and first there is One.
One divides into Two, Two begets Three—
from this arise the Four Images and Five Phases.
No-One is the root of Heaven and Earth;
the Mysterious Teaching’s One is the gate of all wonders.
Change begins within the One to unfold creation;
the human heart’s One governs the warp of the cosmos.
Heaven attains One and is clear; Earth attains One and is tranquil;
valleys attain it and are full; spirits attain it and are numinous.
Things attain it and are completed; people attain it and live;
lords and kings attain it, and the world is upright.
Chan transmits the true Dharma within the One;
Confucianism opens and closes from the One character.
Laozi expounded true constancy through the One;
Zengzi’s “only One” is wondrous beyond measure.
The Dao has Three Vehicles, Chan five schools—
yet in the end, a thousand lamps share one light.
Embrace the Origin, guard the One, and the Mysterious Aperture opens;
be precise, be one, and the Sage’s Teaching is illuminated.
The True One of Great Mystery is the Gate of Returning to Life—
know that the One is the true constant Dao.
Do not say that attaining the One completes all things;
attain the One, hold to the One, and never lose it.
When the One penetrates all, Heaven’s principle is clear—
yet the myriad methods returning to One are not yet extraordinary.
At first, the One and the formless give birth to the myriad existents;
existence and non-existence mutually sustain and endure.
If you can return the myriad existents to the formless One,
only then will you face south and behold the Northern Dipper.
At this point, having attained the One, you must forget the One—
then you may emerge and submerge with the primordial transformation.
If you cling to the One and cannot forget,
you are like a foolish cat guarding an empty burrow.
The Three and Five merge into One, returning to the void;
after returning to the void, the void too vanishes.
When non-void is no more, all is profoundly still—
the Western barbarian’s beard and whiskers are gone.
People today call non-being “non-being,”
wandering in boundless emptiness, treading perilous paths.
People today call the One “the One,”
stubbornly clinging, wasting effort in vain.
If you can grasp the non-being that is not nothingness,
then in guarding the One, you will know the One is no-One.
The two words “One” and “non-being” are both overturned—
Master No-One has completed the great task.

*Song of Embracing the One:*
The Non-Ultimate becomes the Great Ultimate;
the Great Ultimate spreads its wonders beginning with the One.
One divides into Two, giving birth to yin and yang—
the myriad kinds and Three Powers arise from this.
Originally, the true One is utterly void and numinous,
unchanging from ancient times to the present.
Only because essence takes form and spirit awakens to knowing
do the mechanisms of good and evil, causes and conditions, diverge.
Following emotions and chasing illusions, brambles grow thick;
fragrance, flavor, color, and sound all delude and confuse.
If you can investigate the root and origin through the One,
returning to the origin and restoring the fundamental requires no effort.
One man and one woman unite in the center’s embrace—
three daughters and three sons cannot be contained within.
The Three Primes and Eight Trigrams meet in ren;
the Four Images and Five Phases return to utmost stillness.
Suddenly, the crown gate is broken open—
flashing golden light fills the spirit chamber.
The valley of the formless naturally opens;
the Gate of the Mysterious Female opens and closes of itself.
The return of the one yang is wondrous beyond measure;
the Four Virtues circulate Qian without cease.
Vast qi congeals the spirit in profound obscurity,
emerging into existence, entering into non-existence, in the realm of the indistinct.
What is the master within?
It is the original possession of the enlightened gentleman.

*Song of the Wisdom Sword:*
Since the perfected one transmitted the sword’s secret,
the true command is fully raised, resolute and decisive.
If someone asks me to reveal its trace and origin,
I say it is no ordinary iron.
This lump of iron
emerges from the kun direction;
once it enters my hand, it becomes majestic.
Fiercely refined in fire upon fire,
through a hundredfold refinement, it becomes steel.

You who study the Dao, know this secret—
the yang spirit’s might destroys yin demons.
Its divine power and wondrous use are truly immeasurable;
I now lay bare its workings for you.
I tell you,
revealing Heaven’s mechanism:
begin when the one yang returns.
First command the six jia to fan the furnace bellows;
then the six ding wield the pincers and hammer.
When the firing is complete, the sword is forged—
at first, it gleams like lightning.
Wielded horizontally, a chilling wind arises;
plunged upright, a bright moon appears.
The bright moon appears,
radiant light shines—
flashing to earth, illuminating the sky, gods and ghosts lament.
It stirs the turbid and lifts the pure, sweeping away evil and filth,
slaying dragons, beheading tigers, annihilating serpents and oysters.
The six thieves perish, the three corpses are severed—
ties are cut, thoughts cast off, the net of emotions is torn.
Where the divine blade points, mountains crumble—
the demon kings of the three realms are all destroyed.
This precious sword
is originally formless;
its divine power forces it to be named.
To study the Dao and cultivate the real, rely on this sword—
without this sword, the Dao is hard to achieve.
It opens primordial chaos, orders Heaven and Earth—
dissolving obstacles, transforming dust, nothing is beyond its reach.
If someone asks to borrow it and see,
I will take it up and show you—do you understand?

**"Song of Drawing the Crooked Back to the Straight"**

The Dao arises from emptiness, birthing the One Qi—
who imposed names to divide the Five Ultimates?
The One Qi splits, giving rise to the Two Modes:
pure ascends, turbid descends, forming heaven and earth.
Yin and yang weave like a flying shuttle,
while Qian and Kun open and close like bellows.
The Two Modes wondrously unite to form the Three Powers,
and the seven apertures carved open birth the ten thousand kinds.
The true essence of the Limitless refines the primordial chaos—
in daily use, it is ever-present, nothing excluded.
The hundred thousand transformations of life and change
all unfold within this very skin-sack.
If you truly seek the root and origin,
the Four Symbols and Five Phases are already complete.
Reverse the three by day and night, undivided in purpose—
cut off profit at its source, and merit multiplies a hundredfold.
Break through the Pass of Essence and the Pass of Qi,
silently fathoming the celestial and earthly melodies.
Every step aligns with the compass and square,
every aperture shines unimpeded.
If you possess eyes within this,
you merge the two into one.
Lift your head—Mount Sumeru topples;
take a step—the Mysterious Wondrous Camp collapses.
Grasp this single principle to expound the true source,
and the myriad differences converge in the right stream.
Refine the yang spirit to transcend the yang spirit,
rising from the realm of form to the formless realm.

Now I see those who cultivate today—
most fabricate demons and conjure aberrations.
Their qi lofty and overbearing, they scorn their peers,
flaunting wit and boasting of their own mastery.
Sharp in debate, they feign cleverness,
riding high on empty talk, parading wisdom.
Novices are deceived, the learned shun them—
all for show, heedless of future calamity.
Chattering endlessly before others,
like selling water by the riverbank.
Fires of anger flare from stray thoughts,
the mind narrows, chasing circumstances.
Dissipating spirit in vain exertion,
feverishly flailing in chaos.
Refining essence and moving qi—labor wasted;
counting breaths and massaging—mere fleeting pleasure.
Drowsiness and distraction defy control—
if not dull, then scattered—what recourse?
Spirit wanes, qi scatters—how to heal?
Marrow exhausted, form emaciated—regret comes too late.
If you seek the true Dao to escape delusion,
avoid repaying karmic debts.
Gather in your former reckless heart,
overturn your past arrogance.
Extend the heart of serving your father to serving your master,
and first uphold the precepts to receive the teaching.
Extend the heart of forgiving yourself to forgive others,
not blaming them, but bestowing goodness.
Not self-enlightened, yet perfecting enlightenment;
not self-aggrandizing, yet achieving greatness.
Without affairs, without desires, without knowledge—
discard excess, discard extravagance, discard excess.
Establish the foundation and begin with strict discipline,
refining through every encounter and circumstance.
Rely solely on lead and mercury as the elixir’s head—
do not mistake mud for treasure.
Moreover, the upper and lower must alternate in sequence,
not mistaking east and west for Zhen and Dui.
The exchanged pear and fire-date are not kidney and heart,
the wood-fluid and metal-essence are not liver and lung.
Do not cling to Pratyekabuddhas or Śrāvakas,
nor to views, knowledge, or learned explanations.
In the end, nurture the child within the nothingness—
the dhyāna heavens purified, free of the tiniest speck.
The mechanism of nine returns and seven reversals
lies neither within nor without.
The original true form is formless,
eternally luminous, never obscured.
Embrace the One and guard unity, enfolding all emptiness—
steadfast in purpose, diligent in practice, never lax.
Harmonize the Four Symbols, gather the Three Origins,
assemble the Five Phases, unite the Eight Trigrams.
Refine *geng* and temper *jia*, with withdrawals and additions,
knowing the advance and retreat of yang fire and yin tally.
In the stillness of emptiness, the mechanism turns—
in the indistinct and profound, creation revolves.
Two numinous beings enter the Central Palace,
a single golden light illumines all directions.
The Old Woman of Huang in the southwest,
beats the drum to wed the Ding Maiden of Nanling.
The Green-Clad Girl returns to her chamber,
the White-Headed Lord enters the house.
Husband and wife unite in yin and yang,
clouds and rain forget day and night.
Qi solidifies, essence congeals—forming the sacred embryo,
giving birth to a wondrous pearl, most rare.
Four-sided, it gleams with radiance,
eight-faced, flawlessly smooth.
This small round sphere—
ten thousand taels of gold could not match its worth.
I bow to all Quanzhen seekers—
remember the words spoken at Qing’an.
If you truly accept them here and now,
you grasp the very target.
But once the target is made—what then?
The Positionless True Person rides the crane’s carriage.

**Seventeen Poems on the Work of Cultivation**

**Initiating the Ninefold Returned Elixir**
To begin the ninefold returned elixir’s work,
know first the welling spring beneath the mountain’s base.
The furnace’s wondrous use relies on Kun’s earth,
the fire’s labor draws upon Xun’s wind.
Dui’s tiger and Zhen’s dragon just commingle,
Kan’s boy and Li’s girl then harmonize as one.
Once the four images return to center,
the mechanism of creation rests in me alone.

**Right: Arousing the Unenlightened**

**Gathering the Medicine**
Refining mercury and smelting lead—no fixed time,
the learner must seek within stillness to discern.
Guest-dust and desire may taint, yet the heart remains untouched;
when heavenly water first stirs, the spirit knows of itself.
With emotions stilled, gold returns to its nature’s root;
essence congeals, Kan departs to mend southern Li.
When these two numinous things unite,
yin exhausted and yang pure, the Dao may be attained.

**Right: Gathering the Medicine**

**Advancing the Fire**
Once heavenly water begins to flow,
true yang naturally returns in due season.
Samādhi fire arises from Li’s position,
a thunderclap resounds from Zhen’s palace.
Qi and spirit merge to form a numinous substance,
heart and breath interdepend to knit the sacred embryo.
Piercing the inner core’s subtle sign,
the three barriers and nine apertures open as one.

**Right: Advancing the Fire**

**Daily Practice**
True lead and true mercury—great elixir’s head,
gather them where formless form abides.
Acting and striving still bring encumbrance;
seeking nothing, clinging not, one knows no care.
Ever clear, ever still—the heart’s pearl appears,
forgetting things, forgetting schemes—the life-treasure circulates.
In movement and stillness, no obstruction,
where you stand is Penglai Isle.

**Right: Daily Use**

**Consolidating Form**
The Quanzhen’s wondrous principle is not hard to practice,
only fear following conditions, chasing sights and sounds.
Myriad illusions cannot invade when passions cease,
a single heart unstained—thoughts arise in peace.
Banish self and others to fulfill heaven’s principle,
grasp yin and yang to join in supreme harmony.
I tell the elixir-refining noble ones:
when sights and sounds leak not, nature shines complete.

**Right: Consolidating Form**

**Union**
The Dao of true constancy is not at all difficult,
it lies only in daily use, here and now.
One unites Qian and Kun, knowing opening and closing,
the two wheels of sun and moon cycle of themselves.
Returning to the root has its returning aperture,
restoring life has its restoring gate.
Treading the twofold subtle sign,
transcending the mundane, surpassing the sacred—ease itself.

**Right: Penetrating the Barrier**

**Entry and Exit**
The valley spirit never dies—this is the mysterious female,
the very mechanism of Qian and Kun’s opening and closing.
Coming and going without cease,
pushing and surging without fail.
The white-haired old master rides the dragon away,
the blue-eyed foreign lad mounts the tiger home.
Ask where the work’s completion is proven—
the moon’s light encircles heaven and earth.

**Right: Entry and Exit**

**Admonishing the Multitude**
Mouthing the three mysteries in vain boasting,
broad discourse and lofty talk only lead further astray.
Better to embody form to seek true reality,
than to squeeze the eyes and conjure empty flowers.
Following things leads ever to illusion’s end;
turning the head around, you arrive home at once.
Do not fault Qing’an for its blunt speech—
it pries open the heart’s aperture to leave no veil.

**Right: Admonishing the Multitude**

**Correcting Deviations**
Three thousand six hundred side doors,
those who cling to them grope in darkness within.
Each day they merely see with the heart’s eye—
when will they awaken to life’s return to the root?
Keen wit and exceptional talent—what need for the Dao?
Sharp wisdom and deep insight—no cause for discussion.
All forms, names, sounds, and appearances—
in the end, all are but toying with the spirit-soul.

**Right: Correcting Deviations**

**Confronting Demons**
How to forbid night’s drowsy stupor?
Ghostly faces and spirit-heads appear—what then?
Dullness and distraction arise from turbid qi,
thoughts’ discontinuity from excess yin.
When the tide comes, water reaches the shore;
when wind stills, the river’s heart knows no waves.
With nature still and passions void, the heart unmoved,
birth knows no dullness, sleep knows no demons.

**Right: Confronting Demons**

**Revealing the Correct**
The fire-tally is easy, the medicine not forced—
heavenly water rises like the ocean’s tide.
Know to gather the two kinds of mercury and lead,
casting off all desires and objects at once.
Overturning the myriad existences, the three primals unite;
refining all yin, the five qi pay homage.
After ten months, the embryo sheds its shell—elixir’s work complete,
the infant’s form appears to ascend the divine clouds.

**Right: Revealing the Correct**

**Harmonizing**
The great medicine of the three primals—mind, heart, body,
fixating on mind, heart, body binds one to dust.
Regulating breath requires regulating the true breath,
refining spirit requires refining the spiritless spirit.
Suddenly forgetting self and others, the three flowers gather,
fiercely relinquishing conditions, the five qi arrive.
Eightfold open, fourfold unobstructed,
at all times and places, the Quanzhen is revealed.

**Right: Harmonizing**

**Illuminating the Root**
The self arises from emptiness, yet forces a name—
with a name, the heart’s affairs become entangled.
Yin and yang wax and wane through past and present,
sun and moon rise and set, governing death and life.
If you can preserve constancy amid the flux,
you will know noon’s three watches.
Though worldly conduct relies on the master’s teaching,
the work of transcending the world must be self-realized.

**Right: Illuminating the Root**

**Forging the Sword**
The enlightened master teaches me to forge the spirit-blade,
relying wholly on yin and yang’s creative power.
Tempering Qian’s hardness, Kun serves as the forge,
blowing with Li’s fire, Xun becomes the wind.
Crafting dragon and elephant within the heart’s palace,
sweeping away demonic vapors with a marshal’s resolve.
Those who know this art of the Dao’s high adepts
casually cleave the vast emptiness itself.

**Right: Forging the Sword**

**The Toad’s Grotto**
The toad’s grotto—serene and secluded, the finest realm,
where the master, upside-down, makes his livelihood.
The jade furnace smelts the golden liquid,
the golden tripod simmers the white numinous sprout.
Turning the handle of the Dipper to revolve the heavens,
pushing the tally-fire to drive the thunder-chariot.
Once all barriers and locks are pierced,
freely navigate the Silver River on a sturdy raft.

**Right: The Toad’s Grotto**

**Qing’an Hermitage**
My hermitage is no ordinary retreat—
it does not permit casual visits from the common folk.
One wife, one husband can sustain life,
three boys, three girls form a perfect circle.
The inner world is vast indeed,
while the outer void is not so wide.
Ask the master what he is about—
he replies: "Face south and behold the Northern Dipper."

**Right: Qing’an Hermitage**

**Twelve Poems on True Joy**

Buddhas and immortals are all made by men,
yet how can they not know they wander lost?
If not for chasing fame and striving in calculation,
they would surely race after profit, toiling in haste.

Toiling ceaselessly to bear the weight of family,
hurrying endlessly to provide for wife and child.
Even if wealth and honor come, and the wife’s beauty shines,
when impermanence arrives, how can they follow you?
How much better to embrace the wondrous perfection of the True,
where true joy within the heart is known to none but oneself.
The elixir is refined not through refining but in non-refinement,
the Dao is enacted not through action but in non-action.
Still the thoughts, sever the ties to harmonize the ancestral qi,
forget hearing, forget seeing to nurture the infant within.
Once the foundation of the elixir is firmly laid,
five-colored radiance pierces through curtains and screens.
The furnace employs Kun, the crucible employs Qian,
delving into the subtlest principles, one becomes a transcendent.
It is nothing but subduing emotions to return to nature,
which is the refining and merging of mercury and lead.
When all scheming ceases, the elixir glows crimson,
when true stillness is preserved, the treasure hardens firm.
This is the method of withdrawal and addition—
no need for anxious questioning of mysteries.
The fire-tally is easy, the medicine not distant,
creation’s workings are like the great ocean’s tide.
The medicine is gathered only from within the void,
the fire-elixir burns wholly in stillness.
Nine and three converge, all conditions cease,
two and eight unite, the five qi pay homage.
When yin is exhausted and yang pure, the work is complete—
the True Person emerges to pay respects in the divine clouds.

The elixir is first refined by harmonizing qi and spirit,
Dharma-water is poured to kindle the fire of wisdom.
Three substances merge, three natures unite,
one yang revives as one yin dissipates.
The golden furnace stands upright, a thousand spirits gather,
the precious crucible’s work complete, ten thousand images pay homage.
When the medicine is perfected and the elixir formed, the spirit sheds its husk,
the numinous body emerges, naked and unadorned.

The supreme principle of the primordial is wondrous beyond fathoming:
lead arises in the West, mercury in the East.
Water and fire divide above and below,
the Mysterious Pass lies in the center.
To know the unknowable is true knowing,
to comprehend emptiness is true emptiness.
The meaning of being and non-being, of having and not-having—
like the sun’s crimson glow at the ocean’s depths.

Abiding in stillness, one accords with the true constant,
dissolving all yin to restore yang.
Within Kun, the Yellow Dame gives birth to the Crimson Child,
in Li, the Enchanted Maiden weds the Foolish Lad.
On the mountain’s peak, water descends and the Yellow Sprout grows,
beneath the earth, thunder rumbles and White Snow flies.
A thousand miles of silver rivers bear not a speck of dust,
the Golden Toad alone reveals its divine radiance.

The bewitching Young Girl burns to wed the Golden Elder,
all depends on the Yellow Dame’s matchmaking skill.
Once the couple meets,
their cloud-and-rain passions unite in harmony.
At leisure, they drink together in the Vermilion Mansion,
drunk, they sleep side by side in the Purple Ultimate Palace.
Evening joy, morning fear—such weighty bonds of love,
in a year’s time, a little child is born.

Within every person lies a husband and wife,
yet how foolish and deluded they remain!
They do not seek creation within,
but instead lay the elixir’s foundation without.
Falsely taking the Three Peaks’ art of bedroom techniques,
they counterfeit the marvel of Xuanyuan’s Nine Tripods.
Such bestial acts are hard to repent—
soon Lord Yama’s summons will arrive.

The husband and wife within the body I speak of to you:
a blue-clad maiden and a white-haired elder.
Metal’s nature and Wood’s essence unite,
black mercury and red lead naturally resonate.
Beneath moon and wind, the spirit roams in bliss,
clouds drift, rain falls—endless delight.
If you truly grasp these principles,
the true embryo coalesces as easily as turning a palm.

The Great Elixir of Nine Returns and Seven Reversions—
seekers must seek it within stillness.
If you grasp this subtle mechanism,
the two numinous substances will unite.
Three years’ creation is completed in an instant,
nine cycles’ work circles in a moment.
Then overturn the crucible and furnace—
the elixir’s light illuminates the four divine continents.

No written texts are established for transmission beyond the teachings,
for in each person’s portion, the original perfection is already complete.
The subtle breeze of the Mysterious gently purifies the three realms,
the moon of wisdom shines brightly, imprinting the hundred rivers.

The Three Gates of Tusita are but metaphors,
the single finger of the Heavenly Dragon is no true explanation.
Beyond the sound of thunder, messages are conveyed—
this is not Zhou Dunyi’s Supreme Ultimate circle.

**Four Conditions to Warn the World**

Body, mind, worldly affairs—four empty names,
how many deluded souls are ensnared by them?
Calamity arises only from grasping at power and profit,
the wheel of rebirth turns solely for love’s attachments.
To pacify the mind, sever all traces from the body’s movements,
in the world, forget scheming and let things take their course.
When encountering circumstances, always yield and comply—
thus the foundation of life is eternally firm, and nature perfectly luminous.

**Ode to the Gourd**

The numinous sprout’s seed is born of the primordial,
its stem firm, roots deep—such is the principle of nature.
Daily, it is nurtured with earth from Kun’s position,
timely, it is watered with springs from Kan’s midst.
Its blossoms open like white jade, radiant and lustrous,
its seeds form like yellow gold, round and firm.
When the work is complete, a single aperture opens atop—
within, a distinct Qian and Kun are revealed.

**The Heart-Mirror**

Gather Qian’s ore into Kun’s furnace,
the six directions and empty space become one mold.
When the Dharma-image is formed, it shines resplendent,
where mercury is polished, it gleams like jade.
Its radiance extends throughout the three thousand worlds,
its gathering returns to a single millet-grain pearl.
Lift it clearly, and the whole body appears—
yet one must shatter it to unite with the original pivot.

**For Fuan Hermitage: Pointing to the Mysterious Female**

The Mysterious Gate’s female portal is not hard to know—
gather body and mind, and turn inward.
When you grasp the principle of the Two Modes’ ebb and flow,
you will understand the qi’s coming and going.
Qian and Kun open and close without cease,
Li and Kan rise and sink, unite and part.
For Fuan Hermitage, I clearly point this out—
where thoughts return, the elixir’s foundation is laid.

**Matching the Rhymes of Weng’s Learning Record**

Hidden meanings probe the *Cantong Qi* with White Jade Toad,
only by exhausting principles does one become a transcendent.
Before the Supreme Ultimate gives rise to the Three and Five,
one vainly treads the eight thousand leagues to Penglai.
The Śākya family’s tradition relies on the ancestral seal,
the Fuxi lineage’s Dao must be transmitted heart-to-heart.
The jade terrace’s moon alone shines in the azure sky,
imprinting a thousand pools with the same perfect roundness.

**For Deng Yichan**

Chan, Confucianism, and the Perfect Real—
teachings establish three gates to guide later generations.
Śākya’s tradition stores emptiness, one must see nature,
Confucian scholars investigate things, they must preserve sincerity.
The Elixir Terrace retains a spark of fire,
the numinous palace melts away all dust.
When you grasp that the myriad differences return to one,
within and beyond the Terrace of Joy, spring reigns everywhere.

**Seven Poems on Self-Attainment**

Shatter the vast chaos’ aperture—
no Buddhas, no immortals remain.
It is neither a marvel beyond the heart,
nor a Chan phrase on the lips.
Days pass in carefree ease,
nights in unrestrained sleep.
Entrusting the body to the hidden, absolute realm,
all things are left to Heaven.

All conditioned dharmas,
every one, are but dust.

Pursue the principles of all things to their end,
lay down this heart and body.
Wherever you are, settle into meditative stillness,
following the times, delight in the true.
Often wield the marrow of the *Zhouyi*,
to rouse and awaken the worldly.
Having attained the wondrous subtlety of non-action,
you need not step beyond your door all day.

All karmic conditions are wholly severed,
Heaven’s principle naturally abides.
In daily use, Heaven’s movement is strong,
in the ordinary, Earth’s bearing is receptive.
Admonish your disciples at the gate,
return to life and revert to the root.
Break through every barrier and lock,
naturally merging into the Great Harmony.

Tortoise hair was always green,
the crane’s crown was ever red.
What can be spoken is not the eternal Dao,
external practices are but superficial work.
This child is truly of the creative process,
amidst the indistinct and profound.
Attaining stillness of body and mind,
concentrate the spirit, solidify the essence.

The body at leisure transcends the leaky,
the heart in quiescence realizes non-arising.
Sun and moon come and go as ever,
Heaven and Earth change at will.
Vast and unobstructed,
the great radiance alone shines forth.

In daily life, nothing else matters,
but to uphold one’s own sincerity.
In stillness, regulate the breath,
in movement, follow human feelings.
Conceal virtue to blend with the common,
embrace refinement without display.
In the place of true leisure and joy,
ever still and ever pure.
Embrace nameless simplicity in stillness,
worldly passions cannot intrude.

Mercury and lead melt into powder,
tiles and stones transform into gold.
Yearning to see the faces of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor,
to harmonize the hearts of Śākya, Laozi, and Confucius.
Suddenly empty, transcending the actual,
no past, no present.

**Inscribed on My Portrait**
A sallow-faced, emaciated fellow—
what’s so extraordinary about that?
Clearly, those are but borrowed eyes,
yet you claim all hearing and knowing are cut off.
Having seen through the three thousand dharmas,
I’ve harmonized the teachings of seventeen masters.
Bowing my head, hands clasped—
all pretenses are utterly exposed.

**Two Poems on the Mirror and Lamp**
The precious mirror is originally formless,
the transmitted lamp emits wisdom’s light.
True Suchness is inherently pure,
the Dharma-body fundamentally radiant.
The golden crucible burns with true fire,
the flowery pond bathes in the great sun.
Within this, the essential meaning
never departs from the central yellow.

In the quiet chamber, the heart-mirror opens,
in the empty hall, the wisdom-lamp is trimmed.
Without, it shines brightly,
within, it glows resplendently.
A grain of millet appears in the light,
the silver toad is clear in the water’s depths.
Suspended in the golden crucible,
a single grain of the great elixir congeals.

**Two Poems on the Lotus Root**
A singular numinous sprout,
unlike all others.
The Dharma-body is inherently immaculate,
the true nature originally flawless.
Outwardly, every part is curved,
within, every aperture is connected.
Mired in mud, it cannot be submerged,
bursting forth in crimson across the pond.

I am a seed of purity and emptiness,
flawless through the ages.
Weary of the clutter of fame and profit,
I hide deep in the mud.
Ever harboring the intent to aid others,
constantly holding a heart of self-restraint.
So many who dredge and strain—
who among them is a true kindred spirit?

**Two Poems on the Hermitage**
Having chosen the most empty and formless ground,
karmic conditions reside in the Jade Capital.
Lay the foundation firmly,
set the crucible level.
Erect a pillar as tall as Mount Sumeru,
place the crossbeam of the Supreme Ultimate.
The blue sky serves as the roof,
the hermit delights in non-arising.

The earth is leveled as if carved,
the hermitage’s foundation is completed today.
The incoming mountain enters from the south,
the departing water flows west.
Doors and windows are all unobstructed,
the lattice panes are thoroughly bright.
Who is the hermit’s companion?
The white moon and the clear wind.

**Six Lyrics to "Spring in the Garden of Seepage"**
*Composed by Li Daochun Yuan-su of Jingchan of Duliang Hermitage*
*Compiled by Disciple Sunchan Baochanzi Cai Zhi-yi*

**I**
To meet true transmission is to know where to begin—
success is not difficult.
Wait for the moment *gui* is born:
draw forth lead, add mercury,
fire must not be too dry,
water must not be allowed to chill.
Stir the *xun* wind,
fan open the furnace-bellows—
martial refinement and literary simmering are no trifling matter.
Within the golden crucible,
those two numinous substances
are forged into an elixir pellet.
First, you must shatter the web of doubt,
then penetrate the barrier of returning to the root and reviving life.
Let the Red Child ride the dragon,
fetch water from the Palace of *Li*;
let the Metal Lord mount the tiger,
circulate fire to scorch the mountain.
The Metal Lord remains silent,
the Enchanted Maiden gathers her sleeves—
in a single hour, the elixir is wrought.
Swallow it whole,
and you will attain the adamantine indestructibility,
transcending the human realm.

**II**
Dwelling in the Mystery Gate,
without encountering a true master,
you labor in vain.
If you sever learning and non-action,
how can you know opening and closing?
With much learning and wide knowledge,
how can you escape the dust of roots and dust?
Clinging to the natural,
you end in annihilation—
clinging to being or non-being, neither is real.
All is false—
where is the subtlety in those stars?
Seek out a master of the highest order.

**III**
A single word breaks open the primordial cause,
pointing straight to the essence of the elixir head—
*jing*, *qi*, and *shen*.
Ask where the Mysterious Pass lies:
it has no fixed location.
The two numinous substances
reside only in heart and body.
Movement and stillness interdepend,
being and non-being interpenetrate—
the five *qi* return to the origin, and myriad virtues gather.
In the profound and wondrous place,
cluster the One Origin
into a single hour.

**IV**
The Dao speaks of the Five Phases,
Buddhism of the Five Eyes,
Confucianism of the Five Constants.
Moreover, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom—
trust is their root;
metal, wood, water, fire—
earth abides at the center.
White Tiger, Azure Dragon,
Dark Turtle, Vermilion Bird—
all emerge from the Five Lords of the Celestial Hook.
The celestial number is five;
the human spirit, *hun*, *po*,
and intent belong to the Central Yellow.
Heaven and Earth reveal the two fives in full—
when the three and five unite,
the marvel of returning to the origin is beyond measure.
Fire, two, in the south;
east, three, makes five;
north, the Mysterious True One;
west, four, is its kin.
The five earths of the central palace,
combined into three and five—
three and five merge, yin returns to yang.
The adept of the Mysterious,
with lead, silver, cinnabar, mercury,
refines them into adamantine gold.

**V**
The Dao is fundamentally empty and formless,
the formless gives birth to the One,
the One and Two become Three.
From Three, the myriad things are born—
all things are transformed by emptiness,
form after form is transmitted,
thing after thing interpenetrates.
Each body is fundamentally empty,
each head is originally One—
this is not to be discussed casually by ordinary people.
The wonder of emptiness and formlessness
possesses form, name, and appearance,
encompassed within the empty.
Delve deeply into the secret meaning within emptiness—
to reach the ultimate emptiness,
inquire of Lao Dan.
That empty and quiescent stillness,
the ultimate within the non-existent;
emptiness and formlessness thoroughly realized,
piercing the teachings of Gautama.
Before the Emperor of Images,
beyond the Shore of Thunderous Sound—
who else but the pure, empty, and formless?
All the hosts of the Mysterious,
through emptiness and formlessness, meet the Dao—
bowing in reverence, they pay homage.

**VI**
Who clasps hands?
Who joins palms?
Who raises a fist?
These mere tricks—
people still misunderstand them.
The wondrous principle of non-action—
who truly grasps and upholds it?
For all of you,
I clearly set forth:
Laozi, Gautama, and Confucius are one.
Ponder past and present—
the thousand worthies and ten thousand sages
are all the work of human hands.
Pitiful are later learners, devoid of knowledge—
distinguishing right from wrong,
true from false, has no end.
Moreover, heaven, earth, and humanity
share a single source, divided in response;
Daoists, Confucians, and Buddhists—
one principle, what doubt is there?
Seeing nature and illuminating the heart,
probing the subtle and reaching life’s end—
to be a Buddha or an immortal lies only in this.
After the work is accomplished,
though paths differ and schools diverge,
in the end, they all return to the same.

**VII**
I tell you, learners:
fire has no weight,
timing has no hexagrams or lines.
There is no drawing forth or adding,
no action to be taken—
no form or image,
no need for refinement or firing.
Each is unreal,
all is false—
to labor with intent is but vain toil.
Do you understand?
All sounds and sights
are but confusion and delusion.
Cast aside seeing, hearing, knowing, and awareness—
strike through to the numinous terrace, leaving not a single hair.
No more talk of furnaces and hearths,
no seeking of medicinal substances.
The numinous remains undimmed,
the will and power firm and steadfast.
The spirit-chamber is empty and at ease,
the numinous source clear and still—
within it, naturally, heaven and earth commune.
Those who attain perfection—
if they do not perfect their true nature,
how can they escape the kalpas’ turning?

**VIII**
*Oral Instructions for Jing’an*
The primordial spirit spanning kalpas,
the ancestral *qi* from the beginningless,
the primordial essence of the Great Origin—
these three supreme treasures
share a single root and stem.
If you seek the truth,
do not cling to bodily form.
Calm the breath, settle the spirit,
abide in emptiness, solidify the *qi*—
in purity and non-action, essence naturally congeals.
The elixir head forms,
circulate the fire of yin-yang symbols,
gently harmonizing.
Above all, secure and sustain fullness—
refine lead, mercury,
silver, and cinnabar together.
The Four Images harmonize,
the foundation of life is eternally firm;
the Three Origins converge,
awakened nature is empty and numinous.
Nature and life both perfected,
form and spirit both wondrous—
uniting with the Dao, unchanging.
In carefree wandering,
roam the eight poles at will,
free and unfettered.

**IX**
*For Master Qing of Chungu*
Wisdom severs with firm resolve,
the heart rouses with decisive ardor—
thus the Mysterious Pass is penetrated.

**For Master Qing of Chungu (continued)**
Grasp the blade that slays with ease,
gently reveal the knife that revives—
slowly teach its use.
A single sword cleaves the sky,
ten thousand entanglements swept away,
then trust that Śākyamuni and Laozi are one.
The Mysterious Wind spreads—
behold spring blooming in the frozen valley,
a face-to-face encounter with compassion’s visage.
Let snow blanket a thousand peaks—
that jagged, solitary summit
stands blue as indigo.
What of striking bamboo or plucking flowers?
All become relics.
Raising brows, blinking eyes—
mere carelessness.
Beyond kalpas, the radiance of this moment,
here and now, is grasped.
Tear open the mask of appearances,
then cease inquiry.
What is the ancestral master’s intent?
Palms pressed, bowing in reverence.

**For Zhang Xiwei of Kuocang, styled Jian’an**
Unknowing, unhearing,
soundless, scentless—
this is called *xiwei* (subtle obscurity).
This alone is the wondrous root of perfect truth.
Whoever penetrates it
instantly knows the subtle.
Hearing dharma, hearing sutras,
discoursing on Chan, expounding the Dao—
clinging to forms, mired in texts,
all are false.
Do you yet awaken?
This ordinary daily use
is the entire mystery.
Still, rely on decisive ardor in practice—
gather the Four Images,
the Five Phases,
return them to their source.
Master the marvelous union of the Two Modes,
the convergence of the Three Origins.
One spirit undimmed,
ten thousand transformations return.
Essence and *qi* congeal into spirit,
passions revert to nature.
Forth streams the toad’s light,
illuminating all realms.
In wondrous form and spirit,
beyond the Great Void,
alone stands the towering peak.

**The Winding Path and Side Trails**
Three thousand six hundred gates,
each differing in method.
If you cling to the body,
you remain bound to things.
If you depart from form,
you fall into hollow emptiness.
Without dual practice,
how to proceed?
Abandoning both is illogical.
Cultivators of truth—
if you know not the Mysterious Aperture,
your labor is in vain.
This small marvel is fathomless.
Only by direct seeing
can you reach the root of the lineage.
It cannot be heard,
cannot be grasped.
Gazing, it seems present;
seeking, it vanishes without trace.
Each possesses it from the start,
yet none recognize it.
I reveal this celestial mechanism to you:
the Mysterious Aperture,
the workings of emptiness and creation—
all reside within.

**For Layman Wu on the Alchemical Principle**
In the upward work,
the cauldron stands in the *qian* palace,
the furnace rests in the *kun* position.
This fire-phase is subtle,
requiring no effort—
advancing and retreating,
no need for contrivance.
Yin departs, yang arrives,
clouds drift, rain falls—
the mechanism of mastery lies within.
With the heart settled,
that empty numinosity undimmed,
illuminates the darkest paths.
Once the nature-school awakens to the luminous pearl,
this life-root completes the Supreme Polarity.
Beyond the circling circles,
radiant light emerges.
Within the storing-storing,
alone beholds true suchness.
One *qi* returns to the root,
the six gates interpenetrate.
At this stage, rely wholly on virtue’s support.
Amid the dust of the world,
conceal your edge and sharpness—
a perfected ordinary man.

**For Recluse Zhou, the Leisurely One**
The true cauldron, the true furnace,
neither nonexistent nor existent,
only upright and centered.
Within stillness, apply the work;
in quiescence, revolve the mechanism.
Motionless yet responsive,
subtly interconnected—
the old oyster nurtures its pearl,
the mantis charms its young,
such is the wondrous mechanism,
inexhaustible in marvel.
This alone—
once the knot of doubt is shattered,
suddenly awakens to true emptiness.
Gathering lead without leaving the *kun* palace,
wield the fire-symbol,
stirring the *xun* wind.
From the heart of the northern sea’s waves,
capture the White Tiger.
Within the southern mountain’s fire,
seize the Azure Dragon.
The two substances merge,
the three barriers converge—
refined, the divine elixir fills the cauldron, crimson.
Where to conceal the body?
Harmonizing with light, blending with the world—
this is called *xuantong* (mysterious sameness).

**For Zheng Songxi**
Seeming clumsy, seeming foolish,
seeming indolent, seeming lazy,
seeming dull, seeming witless—
this alone is the daily practice of the profound.
If you truly enact it,
it secretly accords with the divine mechanism.
Scholarly understanding, intellectual knowledge,
the *śrāvaka* and *pratyekabuddha*,
all swell the roots of dust, stuffing the belly—
utterly useless.
Only by dying to the heart, treading the earth,
does life equal heaven’s span.
The golden immortal dwells not in the western sky—
no need to mention the blue-eyed foreigner.
Inquire into the nature-school’s single move:
from emptiness, awaken yourself.
In the life-root’s affairs,
take solidity as the foundation.
Void and solid interpenetrate,
presence and absence merge—
form and spirit unite, ascending to sagehood.
The zenith of Chan is pure.
Behold clouds veiling mountains,
moonlight gilding the pines by the stream.

**For Sun’an on Entering Stillness**
Nine revolutions of effort,
the Three Origins’ creation,
a hundred days to establish the foundation.
Then rouse the spirit,
hold fast to resolve,
overturn delusion,
sever doubt.
Raise the brows,
open the heart—
every thing, every head,
swept away with a single stroke.
In the act of practice,
the Dipper’s handle is dragged sideways,
the celestial sphere revolves in reverse.
In the midst of action, grasp non-action—
that which is not-none,
within it, the most marvelous.
At the threshold of the indistinct,
the verge of the obscure—
to guard it is delusion,
to abandon it is error.
Neither guard nor forget,
neither restrain nor indulge—
examine this *storing-storing-storing*—
who is it?
Just so—
await the completion of the six yang phases,
then embrace the toad’s child.

**For Attendant Wang**
The sea of wisdom, deep and clear,
the mountain of virtue, towering and steep—
the master is no ordinary man.

Moreover, to grind down sharpness and resolve entanglements, to dismiss cunning and set aside cleverness—
overturning self and other, yet leaving no trace of mechanism or restraint.
Resolve stands in emptiness, the mind abides in primordial chaos,
probing the hidden intent before the image of the Lord.
In the depths of the profound—
the old master’s original surname,
one thread through the three.
Once he joined the loftiest adepts in arcane discourse,
thus in silence, in darkness, he merged with Lao Dan.
How much more in the numinous realm of emptiness and leisure,
the zenith of Chan, serene and still—
forgetting knowledge, forgetting perception,
no north, no south.
Gathering in body and mind,
fusing with the workings of creation,
all within is overturned to form a sanctuary.
When the divine elixir is complete,
behold its perfect roundness,
illuminating the Song Hermitage.

**Exhortation to Zhong’an on the Wondrous Use of Holding the Center**
The center is the Confucian lineage,
the center is the Daoist root,
the center is the Chan mechanism.
Of the three teachings’ family ways,
the center is the swiftest path;
of the five constants and hundred practices,
the center establishes the foundation.
In movement and stillness, attain the center,
hold fast to the center without wavering—
then peer into the subtleties within the center.
Within its essence lies the delight,
revealed in words—
beware of doubt.
Do you yet know the workings of this center?
It lies neither in the midst nor the four directions.
In daily life’s plainness,
through the center it operates;
in rising, dwelling, eating, and drinking,
all is enacted within the center.
Penetrate this center,
and you grasp the center’s body—
the character "center" originally admits no opposition.
When the center is fully realized,
split it open with the center—
only then are you a true man.

**For Abbot Yuan of the Round Hermitage**
The human heart is perilous,
the heart of Dao is subtle,
within the center lies the mechanism of transformation.
Where is its wondrousness?
It arises from no contrivance,
luminous and unobscured,
the radiance of wisdom’s moon.
Whether called *qi* or spirit,
whether refined or unified,
like jade without flaw, heaven and earth return to it.
In the realm of the profound,
take the single stroke within Kan,
and move it into Li of the South.
The red dragon coils around the black turtle,
in the sixth month, frost bears strange fruit.
That white-haired old man
comes to wed the plain maiden;
when the fetal immortal’s dance concludes,
they enter the yellow curtain together.
Clouds bring rain, winds carry harmony,
yin and yang flow in accord—
a year’s effort nurtures the child.
Constantly nurture it,
awaiting the Jade Emperor’s decree,
then ascend on clouds to return.

**Exhortation to All Disciples**
The Dao resides in ordinary people,
in the midst of daily use—
yet people remain unaware.
Alas, amidst the tangled web of perceptions,
the surging red dust,
the spirit’s source is unsettled,
the moon of the heart lacks radiance.
The mountain of self and other looms high,
the sea of right and wrong stretches wide—
overturn all, and you approach the subtle.
All you noble ones,
hear the parable of the Clear Hermitage—
beware of doubt.
First take purity as the foundation,
use stillness and stability
as the hermitage’s self-sustaining abode.
Let the center be the gate,
rectitude the forest and couch,
sincerity the path,
reverence the fence.
Be humble and yielding with others,
modest and respectful in dealings—
in eating, dwelling, rising, and resting, do not transgress.
Practice this constantly,
and if your effort never slackens,
you will enter non-action directly.

**To the Tune *Man Jiang Hong*: For Xu’an**
In daily practice,
only one flavor—
embrace emptiness, hold to simplicity.
When diverse paths converge as one,
a hundred thoughts unite in singularity.
In the Purple Pole Palace, the primal *qi* breathes;
within the suspended crucible, the three flowers gather.
Ask how to tend the furnace, establish the crucible—
cast with the metal of Qian.
Bind the golden crow,
seize the jade hare,
capture them,
seal them in the earthen cauldron.
In the firing’s ebb and flow,
take greater care in guarding.
When the jade treasure is perfectly formed, it shines in entry and exit;
the Dharma-body’s form leaves no trace of coming or going.
Then conceal yourself,
ascend directly to the Great Clarity Palace—
the spirit abides eternally.

**In Praise of Shui’an, Steward Yin**
Who is the hermitage’s child?
Who stands within,
upholding the hermitage?
Seeing hunger come, he eats—
who knows the sweet and bitter?
The notes of horn and zither—who discerns them?
The hues of blue, yellow, black, and white—who can perceive them?
In the ordinary exchanges of daily life,
who makes the distinctions?
Who walks?
Who lifts?
Who is silent?
Who speaks?
Penetrate these,
and you know host and guest.
The outer form—who fashions it?
The inner gate—who comes and goes?
In non-action’s end,
who ultimately dwells in the hermitage,
the Scarlet Mound Palace?

**Instructions for Jue’an**
The Dao is fundamentally natural—
but to act is error at every turn.
If you merely discourse on emptiness,
how can you grasp it?
To forget both being and non-being never concludes;
to employ both sides is to be ensnared.
Nothing compares to silently guarding the center—
the spirit at ease, joyful.
Past affairs—
forget them.
Future matters—
do not ponder.
In the present’s work,
do not cling.
The six desires do not arise, the three poisons are extinguished;
when the single yang returns, the host of yin is stripped away.
Awaken to true emptiness,
embrace the root and return to original emptiness—
this is true awakening.

**For Magistrate Ding: The Three Teachings Share One Principle**
The three teachings’ true transmission—
this path,
originally so direct.
Ask of Laozi’s mechanism—
ultimate emptiness, utmost stillness.
The Buddha’s nature is awakened within emptiness;
Confucius’ principle enters through sincerity.
From the beginning, though the teachings branched into three,
their source is one.
The Dao’s mysterious gate
constantly responds to things.
The *Yi*’s subtleties
must be silently grasped.
The Chan school’s profound essence—
true emptiness, utmost quiescence.
Moment by moment, uphold it without interruption;
lifetimes of use know no end.
Then return to the root,
restore life to the body of original emptiness—
concealed in utmost secrecy.

**For Li the Sleeping Daoist Judge**
A fine sleeping family tradition—
another kind of
sleeping samadhi.
As long as the heart is sincere in sleep,
the mind is clarified within sleep.
Once the method of sleep is mastered,
within sleep you harmonize spirit and *qi*.
This sleeping practice—
its subtleties in peaceful Chan—
few understand.
Though the body sleeps,
the nature is not obscured;
though the eyes droop,
the inner vision is not closed.
In deep sleep,
steady and secure—
a pillow of cool breeze chills the bones,
dreaming beyond the world in carefree play.
Upon waking,
the body rests in the Palace of Broad Cold,
embracing the toad in slumber.

**In Praise of Layman Fu of the Round Hermitage**
This circle,
since time immemorial,
has borne no form.
Moreover, upright and proper,
poised and balanced—
entering the finest dust, it leaves no shadow;
encompassing the cosmos, it finds no place to rest.

Yet it traverses heaven and earth, unbound in all directions,
no barriers obstruct.
Rootless origin, formless state—
glittering bright, radiant and round.
This alone is the original visage.
Released, it soars straight beyond the formless realms;
recalled, it hides within the treasury of light.
Wait until the crown bursts open to reveal perfect penetration—
the golden countenance.

**In Praise of Prefect Zhang of Zhi Hermitage**
Only upright, only centered—
this is the secret formula for cultivating immortality.
Should there be the slightest bias,
movement breeds distinction.
Try to maintain steadfastness amid motion,
and naturally within stillness the mechanism becomes thorough.
Comprehending the Three Origins and Five *qi* entering the Yellow Court,
golden flowers bloom.

The firing process has its seasons:
the ocean tide rises, the moon in the sky.
That which ascends and descends,
waxes and wanes.
Ten months of unbroken effort,
and the wondrous one transcends birth and death.
If you ask me of the matter beyond—
no words suffice.

**In Praise of Mi Hermitage’s Exposition of the Three Teachings**
There are three teachings,
yet at their ultimate point, they are originally one.
This single-character Dharma-gate
is fathomless in depth.
Laozi’s Valley Spirit is ever undying,
Confucius’ *Xin Yi* initially without design.
Ask of Śākyamuni’s mind beyond teaching—Nirvāṇa—
profound, profound, profound.

To learn the immortal’s way, stabilize the breath.
To learn the sage’s way, forget knowledge and perception.
As for the Buddha’s mechanism of attainment,
it relies solely on the power of wisdom.
Daoist, Buddhist, and Confucian streams—all are penetrated,
the work of perfect clarity and luminous awareness complete.
Behold the crown breaking through to see true suchness—
radiance blazing.

**In Praise of Zong the Daoist of Wei Hermitage**
The work of observing return
requires silent, steadfast preservation.
In the midst of extreme stillness, a single movement—
then the mysterious and the female are penetrated.
Within the indistinct and vague, emotion merges with nature;
in the valley of emptiness, the marvelous finds its match.
Now I take the supreme mechanism of the ancestral masters
and dissect it for you.

That which speaks
does not depend on the mouth.
That which grasps things
does not depend on the hand.

The legless child
can somersault.
Grasp but a sliver of the marvelous,
and naturally you’ll penetrate "being within non-being."
Ask what the true meaning of "coming from the West" is—
it’s twisting the nose into shackles.

**In Praise of Mi’an**
A single grain of golden elixir,
its origin—who knows the kalpas?
If you don’t recognize the root-source,
how can you harmonize it?
Moreover, it’s what you’ve always inherently possessed—
why cling to forms and contrive needlessly?
I clearly reveal it to you, seekers of immortality—
the celestial mechanism laid bare.

Soft as silk,
hard as iron.
Sharp as gold,
round as the moon.
Yet neither square nor round,
without flaw or lack.
Release it, and it opens the aperture of heaven and earth;
withdraw it, and it hides in the cave of emptiness.
Ask what it is when neither released nor withdrawn—
hard to describe.

**In Praise of Yi’an**
The true mechanism of the Three and Five,
in application—everywhere it is so.
Moreover, in daily use, ordinary and constant,
it stands majestic and silent.
Within being and non-being, forget dualistic views,
and you’ll penetrate the samadhi of formlessness.
Yet how can it be "less" or "more"?
It’s hindered by clinging to distinctions.

The lead of the watery realm—
just this one flavor.
This alone is
the primordial qi.
When the toad and crow unite as jade,
body and mind merge in harmony.
From the West’s four, return to the North’s completion;
from the East’s three, join the South’s two.
Gather the five kinds into the crucible—
the elixir is complete.

**In Praise of Layman Sun**
This speck of numinous emptiness,
from ancient times—
without flaw or lack.
Ever radiant, ever round,
ever limpid, ever clear.
It illuminates the primordial chaos of former affairs,
distinguishes the idle caves amid the moon’s hollows.
Within the hermitage, nurture a white toad—
bright as snow.

That which is,
cannot be spoken.
Sharp as gold,
round as the moon.

The transformations give rise to life, life to transformations—
ceaseless, without rest.
When the misty waters swirl, Heaven’s Essence descends;
where the earthly thunder stirs, dark frost congeals.
Mounting the azure phoenix,
one ascends straight to the Palace of Broad Cold—
transcending birth and extinction.

**In Praise of the Silent Hermitage**
Silence is speech—
yet in this speaking, silence originally abides.
This silent speech alone
is the secret formula of the golden elixir.
Silent recognition, subtle communion—this is the great essential;
the paths of Hearers and Pratyeka-Buddhas are but empty constructs.
Within speech, discern the root of silence—
beyond birth and extinction.

Those who speak
are not bound to the tongue.
What is silent
differs not from speech.
Yet this silence—
how could it compare to speech’s intimacy?
If one finds the flavor in wordlessness,
then in non-silence, all is thoroughly penetrated.
When silence and speech are both overturned,
the celestial mechanism is revealed.

**In Praise of Hermit Ge of the Reverent Hermitage**
The Dao is fundamentally wordless,
yet the learner must subtly commune, silently recognize.
When all thoughts are relinquished,
the numinous emptiness shines pure and still.
In movement, harmonize fire within water;
in stillness, fathom the perfection of Pāramitā.
Ask: where lies the mysterious pass, the single aperture?
Seek it in the center.

It is not mind,
nor thing.
Not immortal,
nor Buddha.
Only this truth—
few indeed know it.
The deluded toil in vain to the end;
awakening comes without the least effort.
Behold: from nothingness, being arises—
the spiritual embryo is born, the yang spirit emerges.

**A Prophecy for Disciples**
The mysterious pass of my Dao
admits no outsider to enter.

When seekers come to inquire, guard against their thievery.
Brandish fiercely the blade that slays the living—
yet with a healer’s touch, lightly reveal the art.
Lift high the single thread, flaunt your spiritual prowess—
who could withstand it?

If one is a true vessel of wisdom,
they will rise to the challenge, their heart unwavering.
Rely on resolute courage and boldness:
meet the Buddha, slay the Buddha.
Each step outshines the ten sages;
each word devours the three realms.
Upheave heaven and earth, overturn the cosmos—
truly extraordinary!

**Instructions to Disciples on Returning with the Elixir**
Upon gathering the medicine, this crucible—
forged of unyielding metal—
holds no principle but that which the master commands.
First sweep clean the roots of perception,
abandon all former attachments.
Ask: how to proceed with the firing process?
Rely on prajñā.

The chariot of the five thunders,
the Green Dragon’s grasp.
The talisman for burning mountains,
engraved upon the heart.
Further, purify thoughts, wash the mind,
bathe in the numinous spring.
When the ninefold work is complete and the Dao of the elixir fulfilled,
the single spirit returns to emptiness.
That naked, unadorned Dharmarāja-body—
nothing to grasp.

**To the Tune of "Court Full of Fragrance" – For Prefect Jiao**
In the solitude of mountain dwelling,
amid the clamor of market seclusion—
each and all are the mysterious pass.
Wise and enlightened scholars,
must seek it within stillness.

I wield the healer’s art—
yet it is the blade that slays, slowly taught for you to see.
Should you awaken now, grasp this truth at once,
and liberation will not be difficult.
A single word—
plainly spoken, breaking open the way:
at the outset, begin with the threefold three.
From the Mysterious Palace, kindle the fire,
and circulate it into Kun Mountain.
Hold fast—then clouds mass at the valley’s mouth;
release it—then the moon sinks into the cold pool.
When the work is complete and the cycle fulfilled,
the great toad takes form,
and your name is inscribed among the immortals’ ranks.

**Further – For Master Ding’an, Who Received the Record**
To study Buddha, to study immortality,
to investigate Chan, to fathom principle—
all remain within the Mysterious Female’s gate.
Pitiful are those lost in delusion,
ever deceiving themselves with empty forms.
They pluck leaves and chase branches in vain,
wearing through mat after mat in futile sitting.
How lamentable—
seeking without while the truth lies within,
mocking old Gautama.

A touch of true creation:
if you could but witness it directly,
your gall would chill, your heart grow cold.
Noble scholar of Ding’an,
you must seek it within stillness.
See through the face you were born with,
and overturn all past learning and understanding.
True emptiness pierces through,
the skull shatters,
and the true master departs the hermitage.

**To the Tune of "Prelude to Water Melody" – For Inspector Wang of He’an**
The earthen crucible must be upright,
its steadiness questioned of the Yellow Elder.
Flow from wu to ji,
awaiting the mountain’s hidden spring to rise.
Gather the medicine—beware haste;
temper the firing—avoid excess.
The virtue lies in attaining the center.
Holding to the center is never easy,
yet heaven’s principle responds and opens.

That subtle, wondrous point—
truly hard to fathom.
Since the day I grasped it,
there has been no day in this hermitage without spring’s breeze.

Then marry the Western Maiden to the Southern Child of Ling,
their union forever harmonious and shared.
By the tenth month, the sacred embryo is complete,
shedding its shell to gleam in the void.

**To Master Zhou Qiuchan**
Lead and mercury leave no trace,
the crucible and furnace but borrowed names.
At first, movement and stillness delude men,
unawares, they fall into the realm of sound and form.
This wondrous principle of prior heaven,
in daily life—dressing and eating—
stands before you, utterly clear.
In responding to things as they arise,
stillness moves and awakens.
Not the mind, not the Buddha,
nor is it gold.
Sharpen your vision,
lest you mistake the fixed pole star.
Scattered, the clouds of delusion dissolve;
limpid, the zenith of meditation alone emerges—
this is the original truth.
When the wind stills, the waves subside;
the moon fills, and the water’s light turns clear.

---

**To Master Baochanzi**
To learn the Buddha or the immortal’s way,
profound mystery lies in sincerity.
True lead, true mercury—
nothing but nature and emotion.
When emotion returns to nature,
lead flows to meet mercury,
and the two unite of themselves.
In daily use, no gap remains;
the great elixir forms naturally.
Know when to draw back, when to advance,
how to maintain fullness.
The earthen crucible, the heavenly furnace,
yin talismans and yang fire—temper them slowly.
Once the mysterious pass is pierced,
the eight petals of the crown shatter,
and the radiant toad bursts forth.
With merit and practice both perfected,
laughing, you may pay homage to the Three Pure Ones.

---

**To Layman Liu**
In the world yet not of it,
dust does not cling to dust.
Abiding in centeredness,
what matter if in market or mountain forest?
Walk without bias or deviation,
in daily life, without contention or attachment—
this alone is the perfect truth.
Let not the square inch of the heart grow dim,
and you are a master of the highest vehicle.
Gather primordial essence,
refine primordial qi,
restore primordial spirit.
When the three primordials unite,
the great elixir naturally congeals within the crucible.
Then stir the mysterious wind,
dispel the wandering clouds beyond heaven,
and the moon of wisdom shines bright.
Knock at the gate of the first principle,
and the river’s peaks stand green.

---

**To Zhang Meng’an**
Thunder lies dormant in the earth,
a hidden spring gushes beneath the mountain.
Grasp these two principles,
and creation naturally aligns with the mysterious.
Guard stillness in perfect emptiness,
and in the midst of nothingness, wondrous being appears—
the nine orifices open as one.
Proceed directly to claim it—
this is the true master.
Do not cling to non-being,
do not cling to being,
do not cling to emptiness.
Shatter the knot of doubt,
and suddenly you stand atop the wondrous peak.
Sweep away the clutter of external realms,
gather that which is numinous and luminous,
and creation knows no bounds.
What, in the end, is to be said?
The sun rises east of the ridge.

---

**To Master Shian**
The Dao is the body of the Dharma,
the Dharma is the surplus of the Dao.
When Dao and Dharma are both complete,
all things—whether grasped or inverted—are at your command.
This very primordial spirit and primordial qi
are the celestial soldiers and generals;
beyond them, there is nothing.
I tell you, Master Dongchan:
within stillness, do the work.

Guard it as the embryo,
use it as the aperture,
employ it as the talisman.
Once this principle is clear,
why trouble with ink and cinnabar?
If essence is concentrated and qi firm,
you may command thunder and dispatch lightning,
and all demons and monsters will be subdued.
When merit is fulfilled and practice complete,
laughing, you may pay homage to the immortal capital.

---

**Instructions to the Assembly: Distinguishing This from That**
The three teachings—Daoist, Buddhist, Confucian—
differ in name but not in principle.
Whether meditating or exhausting reason,
only seek to embrace the root and return to the origin.
Grasp the workings of the one center,
and the three primordials converge like spokes,
all chronic ailments vanish.
When the house is firm,
then you may erect the elixir furnace.

Refine the returning elixir,
complete the Great Ultimate,
gather the mysterious pearl.
The subtle mechanism—
draw forth the yang within kan to fill the li.
If you neither crave nor cling,
directly transcend sound and form,
and spirit and qi wholly return to emptiness.
All appearances are comprehended,
and the innocent child emerges from the divine hut.

---

**To Bai Langu**
The three primordials hide in autumn waters,
subtle and profound, beyond measure.
Before clear and turbid divided,
heaven, earth, and humanity were one.
This is the true water of the Great Mystery;
from it, the two qi transform and operate,
and the principles of the three ultimates are fully revealed.
The marvel of ascent and descent,
the root lies in the central yellow.
The rabbit bears the embryo,
the ox pants at the moon,
the clam holds the light.
When one understands this principle,
the Dipper’s handle is upturned, and the treasury’s silver unfolds.
Sever the lineage of Caoxi,
overturn the three isles of Penglai—
nowhere is not a land of immortals.
Who is this Bai Langu?
At ease, he moves the Fuxi’s heart.

---

**On the Dao**
The three primordials hide in autumn waters,
yet without awakening, one vainly speculates.
If you can truly penetrate it,
wash the heart and cleanse the thoughts, returning to hidden depths.
Let intention, body, and heart remain unmoved;
essence, qi, and spirit merge,
and heaven’s principle naturally manifests.
The three virtues are complete within me—
I laugh at those who refine the mysterious and yellow.

Nature is all-embracing,
the heart open and vast,
virtue radiant.
The Cowherd and Weaver Girl,
at once unite in the celestial river.
See through the tricks of riding the raft,
secretly align with the message of bathing in the Yi—
swim in the realm of being and non-being.
In daily life, there is nothing else;
reading the *Yi* before the Three Sovereigns.

---

**On Nature**
The three primordials hide in autumn waters,
yet none belong to thought.
Gather them to the finest point,
release them, and even the earth cannot contain them.
Past, future, present—
only the stars’ subtle message,
manifesting in things, is clearly revealed.
Originally without form,
it appears everywhere as blue and yellow.

The source of nature is pure,
the ground of the heart still,
emitting celestial light.
The wooden man at midnight,
riding an iron horse across the silver river.
Just as dew chills and mist cools,
with wind clear and moon bright,
ride the interest to the land of water and clouds.
See through the dream within the dream,
and bow to the August Void.

---

**To the Tune of "Hundred-Character Command": For Master Zhenchanzi Ye**
To pierce the mysterious pass,
in your practice, await the return of the first yang.
When heavenly water begins to flow, act swiftly—
in gathering, be reverent and sincere.
Cut off thoughts, forget schemes,
purify the heart, release burdens,
and recognize the valley of emptiness.
Lead, silver, cinnabar, mercury—
in a single moment, they gather.

In an instant, heaven and earth unite,
the stems of jiǎ and gēng merge without gap,
dragon and tiger both submit.
Draw forth the kan to fill the li,
complete the body of qián—
yang fire and yin talismans, their work fulfilled.

The supreme treasure congeals and hardens,
the true toad’s form emerges—
it is fitting to bathe it with the numinous spring.
Virtue perfected, merit complete,
the master’s name is inscribed in the immortal register.

---

**On the Sequence of Nature and Life at Zhong’an Hermitage**
The mysterious pass is but one aperture,
its principle profound, its subtlety beyond words.
At the moment when yin reaches its extreme and yang begins to stir,
there lies the season for gathering lead.
Thunder rumbles beneath the earth,
water descends from mountain peaks,
and the red dust of the world is blanketed in snow.
In the midst of practice,
restrain the horse and ape—let them not run wild.

In an instant, the tiger roars and the dragon sings,
husband and wife unite,
and within the crucible, the elixir’s head takes form.
Yet to have a body beyond the body is still not the ultimate—
only through sudden perfection can one attain thorough comprehension.
Lush yellow blossoms,
verdant green bamboo—
this principle is not easily divulged.
For you, I raise it as an example:
scooping the bright moon from the water.

---

**To Chen Zhigan**
In cultivating the Dao and longing for truth,
delight in clarity and emptiness,
freely and blissfully abiding in stillness.
Wealth, honor, and glory—none are clung to,
content with utter poverty to the bone.
Name and profit both relinquished,
right and wrong unrecognized,
one buries the self away.
Truly at leisure, truly still—
who knows the message in this?

I speak of the mechanism beyond all mechanisms,
the formless pearl of mystery,
the fire’s timing without fixed moment.
Once the aperture of the mysterious pass is fully penetrated,
sudden awakening is neither mind nor Buddha.
Dualities of thought forgotten,
being and non-being intermingle,
and the embryo prepares for the primordial spirit to emerge.
The eyes open wide,
radiance pervades boundlessly.

---

**To Scholar Hu**
From the beginning, a single point,
luminous and thus—
without form, without shape, without substance.
Unmoving, unshaken, ever in perfect stillness,
truly cutting off all traces.
Transforming without limit,
manifesting and subtle without gap,
its wondrous principle defies conjecture.
For you, I reveal it:
banish all karmic thoughts and worldly knowledge.

Let the square inch of the heart be emptied and stilled,
the head wrapped and settled,
only then will the true essence be seen.
The three and five merge, the heart-moon gleams,
illuminating the origin and history of the original source.
Flickering, round, and bright,
thus and unmoving,
its transformations ceaseless.
In stillness, it is grasped—
the toad’s light blazes beyond all bounds.

---

**Instructing Minister Zhang, the Old Toad, on Where to Begin**
The great essentials of the golden elixir
are not hard to know—
the subtlety lies in acting when yang arises.
In daily life, be ever vigilant in solitude,
lest the tiger and dragon flee.
The heart must be at ease,
the body firmly settled,
the intent constantly preserved.
Unwavering from start to finish,
naturally the mysterious gate will open.

Amid minor confusions,
I point directly for you:
listen to the thunder’s roar beneath the earth.
Erecting the crucible and installing the furnace is no small matter—
their operation and rotation depend on the Dipper.
Nature is originally round and bright,
life’s foundation firm,
having seen through the "nothing" that contains "something."
The old toad takes form,
its lifespan equal to heaven and earth.

---

**To Tong’an**
In the great beginning, a single point—
fundamentally numinous and bright,
inherently pure and without admixture.
Clinging to even the slightest bit leads one a thousand miles astray,
yet awakening takes but an instant.
The heart’s square inch is empty,
not a speck of dust stands,
what need is there to regulate geng and jia?
Once you undertake it,
before your eyes, you will believe there is no dharma.

Within it, the revealed secret is hard to transmit,
nameless and unutterable,
its value lies in the heart’s comprehension.
Grasp it freely, and you will recognize it—
without crevice, how could a needle pass?
On the mountain of self and others,
in the sea of right and wrong,
one must further know life and death.
Nurture the formless,
and the numinous realm of forgetting form will unfold.

---

**Dispelling Doubts for the Assembly**
The swift path to immortality
lies in the mysterious pass—
one aperture, four directions, eight reaches.
First, instruct learners to establish resolve;
after awakening, it takes but an instant.
How laughable the deluded disciples,
who seek no teacher’s guidance,
clinging to side doors and methods.
Refining essence, refining qi—
in the end, all are mere detours.

Little do they know the great Dao is open and vast,
level and straight,
yet still requires a teacher’s revelation.
Once you grasp that good conduct leaves no tracks,
the mysterious female naturally opens and closes.
With a single thought of non-arising,
the valley spirit never dies,
and the ninefold work comes full circle.
Shedding the embryo, one returns—
striding through the Great Brahma Heaven.

---

**To the Tune of "Moon over the West River": To Daoist Pan**
True earth, true lead, true mercury,
primordial spirit, primordial qi, primordial essence.
When the three primordials unite, the elixir formula is complete—
this is the highest grade of the perfected.
In movement and stillness, numinous and unwavering,
completing the true form, round and bright.
Both form and spirit wondrous, delighting in non-arising,
one directly meets the August Void in its ultimate realm.

---

**To a Good Friend**
The supreme Dao originally has no words—
it depends entirely on unwavering resolve.
Keep the heart ever unobscured, delve to the root,
and a thousand pools reflect the same moon.
Once you grasp chasing wind and catching shadows,
you will know how to plant lotuses in fire.
Let the seas turn to mulberry fields—
only this remains fundamentally unchanged.

---

**To Zhou Shouzheng**
Seeing through the illusion of self and others,
what need is there to seek Buddha or immortals?
At all times and in all places, abide in meditation,
untainted by all illusory dust.
Whether in mountain seclusion or wild places,
or amid the bustle of city gates,
hold to the center, guard the three fields,
and in time, the spirit-pearl will appear.

---

**Refining Cinnabar: Chanting the Mysterious Female for the Assembly**
Few understand the mysterious female—
I tell you, gentlemen:
do not speak of north or south, east or west.
It is not in the four directions, nor above or below,
nor in the center.
Its opening and closing are wondrously inexhaustible,
the root and origin of heaven and earth.
In ceaseless generation and transformation, it exercises spiritual work.
The mechanism of movement and stillness never ceases,
vastly embracing and containing all.

---

**For the Assembly**
The supreme Dao is not transmitted—
it only requires a steadfast heart.
From beginning to end, hold fast to your resolve, never wavering.
Nine years, three years, ever constant—
this is the immortal.
True breathing naturally continuous,
the numinous ground level.
Hungry, eat; tired, sleep.
In summer, a single robe; in winter, a quilt—
beyond the mysterious, there is no mystery.

**Esoteric Sayings Beyond Teaching**

The Buddhist scriptures say: "If one wishes to fully understand all buddhas of the three times, one should contemplate the nature of the dharma-realm—all is created by the mind." This means that where there is creation, there is transformation, and both creation and transformation arise from the mind. People commonly say that the creator of the myriad things is the artisan of creation. I alone hold otherwise. Creation fundamentally has no artisan; the myriad things create and transform themselves. Why? Because all things possess this mind, and where this mind exists, there is creation and transformation—is this not self-creation and self-transformation?

Moreover, all forms in the world arise from non-being into being—this is called *creation*. Once born, they must perish; perishing, they return to non-being—this is called *transformation*. Creation and transformation in endless succession are the constant nature of things. The true nature of the One Reality is originally present, existing without form, and thus without creation or transformation—this is the constant Way. People only recognize the absence of creation and transformation as non-creation, failing to see that the great creation abides therein. Who but the enlightened can comprehend this?

The enlightened, with wisdom all-pervading, perceive all things as empty, return the mind to stillness, and abide in solitary transcendence—thus they are beyond creation and transformation. Those who lack enlightenment cling outwardly to body, mind, and worldly affairs, and inwardly dwell in sensation, perception, volition, and consciousness. Thus they follow the world’s vicissitudes and the cycle of birth and death.

What the eye sees is called *form*. Its reception in the mind is called *sensation*. Once received, it becomes *perception*. Perception unceasing leads to *volition*. Volition, whether good or evil, yields corresponding *karmic consciousness*. The ceaseless flux of karmic consciousness is the root of rebirth—thus one cannot escape creation and transformation. If one is not entangled by illusory conditions, not defiled by sense-dust, not obstructed by deluded emotions, not afflicted by craving and desire, then one can perceive the emptiness of the five aggregates. With the five aggregates empty, where is creation and transformation? This is the wondrous mind of nirvana.

I say that creation and transformation arise from the mind—what doubt remains?

The Daoist texts say: "Being and non-being produce each other." This means that non-being generates being—creation—and being generates non-being—transformation. They also say: "Attain utmost emptiness, guard absolute stillness; while the myriad things arise together, I observe their return." This is to observe the return and know transformation. Knowing transformation, one is no longer transformed; without transformation, how can there be creation? Who but one of unimpeded insight can attain this?

Those of penetrating vision, pure and luminous, can discern the illusory nature of body, mind, and worldly affairs. Within the illusory, what has form is called a thing; when things reach their extreme, they revert, reflecting back into the illusory. One who contemplates thus knows that the formless form is the true form. Nurturing the formless, form endures; preserving the formless, the body remains whole and true. In perfect purity and wholeness, one merges with the great square, vast and boundless, transcending the void—this is beyond creation and transformation.

Those who cling, unsettled in body and mind, assailed by thoughts, lose the formless and scatter the formless body, thus drifting in the cycle of birth and death, forever sinking in the sea of suffering. If one gathers in body and mind, dispels thoughts, prevents the inner from leaking outward and the outer from intruding inward, achieving inner and outer purity, this is called *illumination*. When one forgets the mind within and the body without, the One Reality shines clearly, like the vastness of empty space, unimpeded by creation and transformation—what then remains?

The Confucian texts say: "Neither envious nor covetous, free from blame and praise." This means that without envy or desire, one does not undergo creation; without blame or praise, one does not undergo transformation. The *Book of Changes* says: "Look afar to things, and near to oneself." I say: looking afar to things, one knows all conditions are illusory; looking near to oneself, one knows the five aggregates are empty. Externally, one screens off all conditions; internally, one dissolves the five aggregates—thus one accords with heaven’s workings and delights in the celestial.

Knowing the beginning and end of things, the causes of the hidden and manifest, the principles of life and death, one exhausts principle and fulfills nature, reaching destiny. Delighting in heaven, one is free from sorrow; fulfilling nature, one is free from doubt. Who but one who attains knowledge can reach this? One who attains knowledge is sincere, luminous, still, and settled—thus one knows that ceaseless birth and death belong to illusory form; inequality and discord arise from the deluded mind; impermanence and change pertain to the times; decay and ruin are the fate of affairs. Through refined observation and practice, this is called *sagehood*; unified in one principle, one is beyond creation and transformation.

Without attaining knowledge, one cannot investigate things; failing to investigate things, one is swayed by their changes—where then is nature and destiny? If one is not fixed but circulates through the six directions, then heaven and earth unite with me, and the myriad things are complete in me. When one again perceives the heart of heaven and all things return to the One Non-being, creation and transformation cease.

For example, if heaven and earth did not move, if the sun and moon did not revolve, what would become of the six lines? Without the six lines interacting and reconfiguring, without yin and yang ascending and descending, what would become of the myriad things? The essence of heaven and earth is pure and undivided, unchanging in inversion or uprightness—thus there is no creation or transformation. To create the creationless is the great creation; to transform the transformationless is the great transformation. One who sees thus knows that all things in the world are temporary combinations, and the workings of yin and yang are nothing but illusion. Who but the most profoundly adaptable can match this?

From this perspective, the Three Teachings are but the mind; creation arises from the mind, and transcending creation also arises from the mind. The essence of Buddhist practice lies in seeing one’s nature. To see one’s nature, one must first resolve with unwavering determination to overcome habitual energies, and with disciplined effort, preserve the luminous clarity within. Only then can one illuminate and break through all illusions, the mind not clinging to things, thoughts not following emotions.

Thought is the root of affliction; the mind is the seed of dharmic dust. When thought arises, all afflictions arise; when thought ceases, all afflictions cease. When the mind arises, all dharmas arise; when the mind is extinguished, all dharmas are extinguished. The arising and cessation of thought depend entirely on one’s own mind. When birth-and-death are extinguished, and quiescent extinction becomes bliss, this is seeing one’s nature.

Today’s learners fail to see their nature because they are obstructed by the two hindrances of principle and phenomena. Without great insight, one cannot dissolve the hindrance of principle; without great cessation, one cannot remove the hindrance of phenomena. Great insight means wisdom and severance; great cessation means power and restraint. When wisdom and severance are pure and mature, all principles become empty; when power and restraint are pure and mature, all phenomena become empty. Comprehending the great emptiness of the three emptinesses, and knowing the supreme truth of the one true reality—this is the ultimate of great insight. At that moment, body, mind, worldly affairs, thoughts, emotions, and consciousness all cease together—this is the ultimate of great cessation. Without the highest wisdom, who can attain this?

The essence of Daoist practice lies in preserving one’s nature. To preserve one’s nature, one must first wield the sword of wisdom to slay the hordes of demons and use the fire talisman to dissolve the six desires. Next, with the power of concentration, one forgets emotions and cuts off thoughts, releases burdens and purifies the mind. When the mind is purified, burdens are released, thoughts are cut off, and emotions are forgotten—this is preserving one’s nature. Once true nature is preserved, there is no creation. Today’s learners are seized by emotions and consciousness. To eliminate emotions and consciousness, one must first remove the mind of birth-and-death. When the mind is free from birth-and-death, the body is free from birth-and-death—this is stability. To remove the mind of birth-and-death, one must cultivate the habit of no-thought until it is pure and mature, sufficient to attain dreamlessness. When the stillness and stability of no-thought are pure and mature, one can attain birthlessness. Dreamlessness is the great matter of the present; no-thought is the great matter of the end. Birthlessness means no creation; dreamlessness means no transformation. Without creation or transformation, there is no birth or death. Without the most exalted of beings, who can attain this?

The essence of Confucian learning lies in fully realizing one’s nature. To fully realize one’s nature, one must illuminate the luminous virtue and rest at the highest good. Knowing where to rest, one then attains stability; with stability, one can forget both self and others. The *Yijing* says in the *Gen* hexagram: *"Stopping at the back, one does not obtain the body; walking in the courtyard, one does not see others—no blame."* Stopping at the back means forgetting the mind; not obtaining the body means forgetting the self; walking in the courtyard without seeing others means forgetting things. When these three are forgotten, what blame can there be? This is the ultimate of knowing where to rest. Knowing where to rest, one can forget self and others and fully embody heavenly principle—this is fully realizing one’s nature.

Today’s people cannot fully realize their nature because they are burdened by body and mind. With burdens come obstructions; one must be resolute and decisive. Resoluteness enables one to forget things; decisiveness enables one to forget the self. When both self and things are forgotten, one fully realizes one’s nature and stabilizes one’s destiny. Without divine virtue and sagely merit, who can attain this?

I see that most people regard this body as having a self—how profoundly they fail to reflect! This body exists because of creation; before creation, was there form? Was there name? Was there a self? After transformation, will there be form? Name? A self? Both before and after, there is nothing—how can one stubbornly cling to a self in the middle? They do not realize that body, mind, and worldly affairs are fundamentally illusory; tracing them through the three times, nothing can be found. The past is utterly gone—where is it? The present changes with every thought. The future will certainly be the same. Through kalpas of time, in this great dream and illusion, stubbornly clinging to false conditions, one accumulates the seeds of samsara, thus entering birth and death without end.

If there is someone in this dreamlike realm who awakens, understands, and skillfully navigates it, is this not a supreme person? One day, I presented this koan to my disciples for contemplation. Two or three of them somewhat grasped its essence, so I wrote this text to bestow upon them, transmitting mind with mind. If one can directly accept and silently comprehend it, instantly knowing where to rest, without scheming for the future or worrying about the past, without clinging to the present—when these three merge into one, one attains great freedom. Roaming in the ocean of great quiescent extinction, wandering in the realm of nothingness, swimming in the field of self-attainment—only then does one realize that creation has nothing to do with this.

Yet there is still something beyond. What is this "something beyond"? Hmph! Overturn the foot of the wordless, shatter the great void—only then is one a true man of the Way. Keep this secret, keep it secret.

**On the "No-Learning Without Worry" and Its Preface**

What is called "no-learning" is not non-learning. If one takes non-learning as no-learning, one remains ignorant and indistinguishable from the common crowd. This so-called no-learning is the culmination of extensive learning. Most people learn to be extraordinary, but the more they learn, the less they understand. The sage said: *"The farther one goes, the less one knows."* And also: *"Much leads to confusion; little leads to attainment."* This is precisely the point. A former Confucian said: *"With effort, one rests all day; without effort, one does not rest."* This is the same idea. Thus, I write this piece to demonstrate it, so that learners are not burdened by the hearer and solitary realizer vehicles, or by intellectual understanding and discriminative knowledge.

In daily life, all is profoundly mysterious,
Yet people do not fully recognize it.
One should pursue what the heart truly loves,
And let go of mere verbal Zen.

Every dharma is not an empty dharma;
Every transmission is a false transmission.
Without cultivating blessings first,
How can misfortune arise prematurely?

Without gain, there is no loss;
Without change, how can there be alteration?
Without defilement, there is no purity;
Without lack, there is no completeness.

Do not cling to anger or joy;
Why worry about adversity or obstruction?
Without doing good as cause,
How can evil conditions arise?

Unconcerned with rise and fall,
Name and profit do not entangle.
Coarse and fine incur no worry or aversion;
Beauty and ugliness evoke no hatred or love.

Unburdened by debts of joy,
No entanglements of gratitude or resentment remain.
Breaking free from the net of self and others,
Leaping beyond the circle of right and wrong.

In clarity and emptiness, antiquity holds no charm;
In tranquility and simplicity, the pursuit of worthies wearies.
Cease pondering the life to come,
Release the thoughts of what precedes birth.

Let Buddhas be Buddhas,
Let immortals be immortals.
Freed from the dust of worldly burdens,
Why fear the searing flames of karma?

Neither existence nor nonexistence is established;
Vacuity and reality intertwine as they will.
All arises from non-grasping, non-rejecting—
Naturally, no faults or transgressions arise.

Coming and going are wholly forgotten;
What concern is there for death or life?
Dwelling leaves no lack or excess,
Everywhere adapting to square or round.

Hunger comes—take a bowl of rice;
Thirst arises—drink half a cup of spring water.
When inclined, amuse yourself;
When weary, sleep.

The enlightened understand this principle—
Cease seeking heavens beyond heavens.
Before the eyes, all is radiant and clear;
In the end, all shines bright and pure.
