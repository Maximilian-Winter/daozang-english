**The Authentic Dragon-Tiger Nine Immortals Scripture**
Annotated by the Two Perfected Ones, Luo and Ye

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign addressed the Yellow Emperor, saying: "If you wish to cultivate your body, first still your mind."

Master Ye states: "Those who cultivate longevity and enduring vision must first forget the mind, eliminating seven matters before success is possible. Thus it is said: *First still the mind.*"
Avoid distraction, anger, attachment, delusion, greed, depravity, and dissipation.

Master Luo states: "If one cultivates the Dao while distracted, the mind lacks resolve—how can attainment be achieved? If anger arises, the spirit becomes agitated, and dissipation leads to distraction. One must not cling to any attachments; the essential method is single-minded diligence, free from delusion. Yet the mind often succumbs to greed and desire, giving rise to depravity. If the heart is not forgotten, the practice will not succeed. Only by abandoning greed can depravity be avoided. Cultivate the body with unwavering focus, never yielding to dissipation. If one dissipates even for a day or two after eleven months of practice, all prior efforts are lost. Thus, one must not neglect the proper times, lest the mind become dissipated."

"Internally stabilize the spirit; externally eliminate desire."

Master Ye states: "To stabilize the spirit internally, as the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: *Humans possess five viscera and six bowels, three hun-souls and seven po-souls, and even the hair and skin—all have their spirits.* Regularly knock the teeth to gather the spirits—thirty-six or twenty-four times—stabilizing them within and preventing dissipation. Lustful desires must be strictly avoided."

Master Luo states: "To stabilize the spirit, knock the teeth and visualize the three hun-souls in the form of immortal perfected beings, the fortune-spirits of the human body, known as *Fetal Radiance, Luminous Spirit,* and *Hidden Essence.* Visualize them as if making a vow, and proceed accordingly. Anchor them below the navel: when the three hun-souls are at peace, all spirits are at peace; if the three hun-souls are unsettled, all spirits are unsettled. Thus the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: *The three hun-souls are yang spirits, fond of human cultivation. If one indulges in lust, the essence withers, and when essence withers, life is cut short.* Therefore, the *Hidden Essence* hun-soul grieves over the withering of essence, weeping to the *Luminous Spirit.* Once the *Luminous Spirit* knows, it departs through the crown of the head. The crown is *Fetal Radiance*; when its light gradually fades, the spirit scatters. Thus, all spirits become unsettled, and the person ceases to live. When the spirit scatters, it is called death. Hence, one must externally eliminate desire."

"When practicing these methods, if various afflictions arise, regulate them with qi."

Master Ye states: "Here, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign cites the Yellow Emperor’s question. The Yellow Emperor asked the Heavenly Perfected: *In cultivating the Dao, are there afflictions?* The Heavenly Perfected replied: *Those who encounter the Dao late have already depleted their true qi, leaving it weak and exhausted.*"

Master Ye states: "Before this stage, they have often dissipated their essence."

The Emperor asked: "How does one regulate qi?"

The Heavenly Perfected replied: "Use water sparingly, fire abundantly. No great affliction can withstand fire."

Master Ye states: "Water and fire are the great medicines of the ancient sages, not found externally. Every person possesses water and fire within, though their descriptions vary, their essence is one. The heart is fire, corresponding to *Li*; the kidneys are water, corresponding to *Kan.* To refine the Golden Elixir in Daoist cultivation, one must rely on the Dragon and Tiger’s water and fire. First, still the *Earth Gate* like water, then descend the Dragon and Tiger, uniting them with measure and rhythm. Apply the heart’s fire below to burn away afflictions. For the depleted, it restores youthful complexion—thus it is called the *Great Medicine of the Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir.* All afflictions are thereby cured. For minor ailments, use the method of water-washing from the crown to the feet, employing kidney-water. For greater afflictions, use fire-burning from the feet to the crown, employing heart-fire. For the gravest afflictions—such as the approach of impermanence—use fire to repel and vanquish demons. The methods are detailed in the annotations below."

Master Luo states: "When using water and fire to regulate afflictions, all occurs within a single breath. For the water method, visualize the two kidneys emitting black qi like smoke, rising straight to the crown, filling the *Mud Pill Palace* and transforming into water. From the *Mud Pill Palace,* wash downward to the arms, then into the five viscera and six bowels, and finally to the feet. Upon rising, guide the intention to return it to the original kidney palace. For ailments like abscesses or ulcers, direct the visualization into the large intestine to stimulate natural movement. For the fire method, direct the heart’s fire downward to the left and right feet, then upward to the hands and crown. Within a single breath, apply nine measures of qi, and the illness will be dispelled. For heat, use water; for cold, use fire. When practicing Daoist meditation, close the eyes and gaze at the *cun* thread above the nose, but do not stray from the original cavity—rising from this is called *stabilization.* Rising without progress is stagnation."

Master Ye states: "Focus the original intention on the space above the nose, the *Mysterious Female Gate.* Abandon all affairs, not even clinging to a thread. Detach from the original thought, stabilizing the breath’s coming and going—neither exiting nor entering—this is the method of stabilization."

Master Luo states: "The *Mysterious Female Gate* is the nose, which governs the breath’s exit and entry in union with the lungs. Now, for the stabilization method, rest the breath above the nose, firmly guarding the single intention—this is called *guarding the One.* Do not pursue external realms; what form does distraction take? Next, enter observation between the brows, where the white *mao* light manifests."

Master Luo states: "When stabilized above the nose, observe all realms as unmoving—like the fur of a tortoise or the horns of a hare. Distraction naturally ceases."

Directing the mind to the space between the brows, the white *mao* light shines brightly, revealing the affairs of the three times—through the power of stabilization, one must not cling to any realm. Observe again, and all appears within the space between the brows.

When the force at the brows reaches its peak, shift it into the crown of the head. These three stages—stabilization, solidity, and mastery—are the ascent. Without thought, without attachment, external distractions do not enter, and no misfortune befalls. From nine to nine, refine seven to seven.

Master Luo states: "From nine to nine is one cycle. From the nose to the brows, from the brows back to the nose, then from the nose to the crown—each of these is three cycles, making nine. From nine to nine, performing nine cycles each day, totals eighty-one."

After forty-nine days of practice, stabilization arises naturally. For one period of stillness, neither exiting nor entering.

Master Ye states: "One who attains the power of stabilization becomes a true immortal. If one clings to coming and going, they remain hidden in the world. One should visualize opening the crown gate, where yellow mist fills heaven and earth."

Master Luo states: "This method, when cultivated, conceals one’s traces and withdraws from the world. From the spleen, yellow clouds rise to strike the crown. For men, the left covers the right; for women, the right covers the left. In men’s practice, the yellow cloud rises and strikes the left, imagining the left side elevated—then the sacred body emerges. Press down the right side with the hand to lower it. In women’s practice, the yellow cloud strikes the right, imagining the sacred body emerging, pressing down the left side with the hand—only then does it emerge."

Master Ye states: "This is emptiness. The yellow clouds pervade everywhere, inner and outer resonating, the body suffused with yellow. Cultivating this method, strike the crown gate with yellow clouds thirty-seven times in a single breath. Perform this twenty-one times daily for twenty-one days. When yellow qi emerges, it is called *yellow mist filling heaven and earth.*"

With a tranquil mind, visualize inwardly the presence of spirit. Direct intention to it, and movement becomes effortless. To depart the body, the yellow mist forms a heavy canopy.

Master Luo states: "With a tranquil mind, visualize the numinous darkness within the body, seated in a palace of gold and jade. Direct intention to this numinous darkness, riding the yellow clouds upward, opening the crown gate. Ride the yellow clouds to their utmost, then return to the crown gate, closing it to re-enter the golden palace. Visualize this exit and entry forty-nine times. Thus the scripture says: *Practice the Dao six times daily, forty-nine repetitions.* When departing the body, leave a single yellow cloud to cover the crown gate, then ride another yellow cloud downward. Turn to gaze upon the original body. Only through uninterrupted practice does one succeed. After forty-five days, a water-and-ink form manifests, visible to others. After one hundred eighty days, one naturally gains freedom in coming and going. When departing, the body above and below becomes like ice and snow. Upon returning, the crown gate opens, and warmth suffuses the body above and below."

Master Ye states: "The immortal’s method of sleep—externally practiced—is as Master Luo describes. Regardless of years or months, departure resembles sleep, and return resembles awakening. One may return to the original body, enter another’s body, begin anew, seize another’s place, cause another to depart, offer expedient aid, widely bestow peace, or benefit oneself at another’s expense. If punishment befalls the body, it will surely fall. This method is never false; through endless kalpas, it remains thus."

Master Luo states: "This is the divine immortal—hidden for ages, spirit and qi both numinous, coming and going distinctly. This is called the divine immortal or qi immortal. Free in movement, if one violates the immortal precepts, punishment follows swiftly."

Master Ye states: "Such are the functions of the divine immortal. To seek the true immortal or cultivate the path of ascending as a celestial immortal, one must advance in practice. This method is a minor art, self-cultivated for personal benefit, allowing one to dwell long in the world, freely appearing and vanishing. First, entering the womb; second, moving abodes; third, returning to the old dwelling; fourth, seizing a position. To practice the method of dividing the body, wait for the yang number to flourish. With a tranquil mind, sit in a quiet chamber and clearly refine the five spirits."

Master Luo states: "In cultivating the body, one must approach the time when yang is born to activate the practice. The great elixir of golden cinnabar lies in the tranquil mind. If the mind clings to anything, success is impossible. If one receives transmission from an adept and practices accordingly, one must be vigilant and precise. In a quiet chamber, free from affairs, visualize within the indistinct a spirit—this is the numinous darkness. Refine the qi of the five viscera to accomplish the great Dao. Thus the *Daodejing* says: *Vague and indistinct, within it there is something; obscure and dark, within it there is essence.*"

Master Ye states: "The great Dao is not distant; it resides within the human body. Vagueness and obscurity are matters of personal cultivation. Thus Laozi said: *I originally learned and practiced; it was not natural.* First, one must practice the preceding stabilization method, then await the arising of yang. With a tranquil mind in a quiet chamber, refine the essence-qi of the five viscera—this is the practice of the Dao. The crown stores the great yang, and the number forty-five is complete."

Master Luo states: "The sun is the hun, belonging to yang; the moon is the po, belonging to yin. Thus the true immortal casts no shadow—pure yang. Swallowing solar essence, various schools differ in their explanations; only inhaling through the nose without retention is sublime. There is a method that does not use the river chariot, directly entering through the Mysterious Female Gate to the crown gate. Three points are raised upward, and behind the crown, a halo appears. This scripture does not mention the river chariot, so it is not used. Forty-five times daily, for forty-five days, from the first yang to the advent of spring—this is the number of yang."

Master Ye states: "The sun’s hun and the moon’s po—ordinarily, the sun is the yang number, while the yin number is eight times nine, seventy-two."

The moon pertains to the yin number, yet it employs the yang number—nine times nine, eighty-one. This method being pure yang, it thus uses the forty-five number. Without employing the river chariot, it follows the Dao of Heaven’s leftward rotation, ascending directly from the Mysterious Female Gate to the crown’s rear. Forty-five times daily, for forty-five days, the total count is two thousand twenty-five.

Beneath the brows, the five transport points revolve, then arise from within the state of stillness. Master Luo states: "The five wheels are the eyes. Within stillness, water and fire are circulated through the eyes—hence it is said they arise from within stillness. Within fire resides the spirit of wood; within water lies the qi of metal. Water and fire, the five viscera in exchange, come and go without departing from earth."

Master Luo states: "The true dragon and tiger are the eyes, the king of the five wheels. Fire contains the king of the five wheels, yet water is difficult to obtain. First, the water flashes below, then is held and nurtured within the mouth. From the flash of fire below, it enters the liver. The liver is wood, and wood’s color is green—thus it is the Green Dragon. Water enters the lungs. The lungs are metal, and metal’s color is white—thus it is the White Tiger. The dragon’s fire descends from the left into the liver, pierces through to the right, then returns to the left. The tiger’s water descends from the right into the lungs, pierces through to the left, then returns to the right—this is the exchange of the five viscera’s qi."

Master Ye states: "By day, the Green Dragon moves first, the White Tiger follows—this pertains to yang, twenty-four degrees by day. By night, the White Tiger moves first, the Green Dragon arrives later—this pertains to yin, thirty-six degrees by night. By day, the four-six number is employed; by night, the four-nine number. Plowing and sowing upon the spleen gives rise to the yellow sprout, the root of life. Then visualize the true essence: the two kidneys unite as one qi, and the heart’s blood congeals below to form the likeness of an infant."

Master Luo states: "True essence is the inner fluid. The body is like a tripod: the left foot presses the right, both hands rest behind the back, forming the tripod’s three hollow legs. Concentrate the heart’s blood to cover and bind it. Only then visualize the infant’s form, identical to one’s own appearance, without difference. Though the child is thus formed, the yellow sprout arises upon the spleen—only then is it the root of life. Upon earth grows the yellow sprout—only then is it one’s own destiny."

Master Ye states: "Warm essence and hot blood congeal to form the embryo, just as a woman’s intercourse leads to conception through the union of essence and blood. This sacred embryo is self-created, not derived from without—only then is it sacred. Even for women who cultivate this, they too visualize essence emerging from the kidneys and entering the blood sea, where it congeals into form. Then they ingest the great medicine of the yellow sprout. The great medicine of the yellow sprout—true dragon, tiger, and cinnabar—is the foundation of life."

As the sun first enters, it illuminates the water a hundred times; when the sun treads upon the shadow, the two kidneys’ sun and moon radiance each emit the qi of the red sun. Master Luo states: "After forming the sacred embryo, one must refine the sacred body. Each day at dawn, during the *mao* hour, sit in tranquil meditation. Visualize the right kidney as the moon, from which a red qi emerges, entering water and transforming into white, like a half-moon in shape. Ride this to ascend the sacred body. Visualize the left kidney as the sun, from which a white qi emerges, entering water and transforming into red, like fire beneath the half-moon. Gradually raise this to the Golden Hall and Jade Palace, where it is carried to the crown. The previous forty-five days’ gathering of solar illumination now shines upon it. As soon as the sacred embryo is touched by the sun’s light, it startles and plunges into the water—this occurs in a single breath. Perform this thirty-three times per hour, from the *mao* to the *chen* and *si* hours, totaling ninety-nine repetitions."

Master Ye states: "Refine the sacred embryo daily from the *mao* hour until noon, once per day. Visualize the two kidneys as the sun and moon: the sun emits white qi, which enters the essence sea and returns to its original body, reverting to red. The moon emits red qi, which enters the essence sea’s water and returns to its original body, white as a half-moon. From within the essence sea, the infant ascends. From the sun’s center, the white qi transforms into red fire, like a halo of outer flames. Each time, it is illuminated by the sun’s light at the crown, its radiance clearly entering the five viscera. When the light reaches the child, the infant turns and plunges back into the essence sea. Then visualize the sun and moon’s images anew. This method employs ninety-nine repetitions; if it reaches one hundred, the excess is of no concern."

Nightly, seventy times seven, it emerges from the crown gate—naturally, there is a response. After ten months, it equals the body in size, and in profound obscurity, one becomes an earth immortal. Master Luo states: "Once the sacred body is complete, each night it ascends from the essence sea upon purple clouds to the Golden Hall and Jade Palace, observing every detail from crown to feet. Then it bursts forth from the crown gate, riding the purple clouds. Only when the breath is fully settled does it descend back into the Golden Hall and Jade Palace. When the breath opens, hold it again and repeat the ascent as before—forty-nine times in total. After ten months, the two bodies are identical in size, length, and appearance. One may step forth from the body, moving freely at will."

Master Ye states: "The earth immortal surpasses the divine immortal. Their comings and goings are as one. The divine immortal’s method relies solely on the sacred embryo, differing in its ten months of day and night cultivation. Once achieved, one casts no shadow at noon—yet one wears clothing to avoid detection by ordinary people, donning the same garments and hats as they. When the sun in the sky illuminates the shadow, one sees only the hat depicted in the image, for the body’s shadow is hidden—hence the name ‘concealing form.’ With the swift step, one hundred eighty days suffice to traverse ten thousand *li*, entering the mountains as an earth immortal. Refine the qi of the kidney viscera, entering and exiting through the ears—after one hundred days of this, one may dwell within rivers and seas."

Master Luo states: "The water immortal, when settling the breath to refine qi, visualizes the kidneys as black clouds, entering and exiting through the ears. After one hundred days, one may enter water, where those who attain the Dao in water naturally become its masters."

Lord Ye states: "Though the water immortal’s practice requires but a hundred days, its attainment is not equal to that of the earth immortal. Refine the essence-brilliance into a sword, roaming the Four Heavens to repay kindness and redress grievances—this is called the *hero of resolve*.

Master Luo says: "The ranks of sword immortals differ in nine degrees. The first is the Heavenly Sword Immortal; the second, the Transcendent Sword Immortal; the third, the Spirit Sword Immortal; the fourth, the Wind Sword Immortal; the fifth, the Water Sword Immortal; the sixth, the Fire Sword Immortal; the seventh, the Qi Sword Immortal; the eighth, the Ghost Sword Immortal; and the ninth, the Encountered-Sword Immortal.

The Heavenly Sword Immortal is a celestial transcendent who receives a sword bestowed by the Supreme Emperor. The Transcendent Sword Immortal, having cultivated the conduct of ascending to the Upper Realms, further refines cinnabar into a sword. The Spirit Sword Immortal, already an earth immortal dwelling in mountains and peaks, forges a sword-dagger; upon hearing of injustice a myriad *li* away, the flying sword arrives instantly—hence the name *Spirit Sword Immortal*. The Wind Sword Immortal, also an earth immortal, has forged a sword-dagger but has not yet attained perfect spirit-communication; sensing injustice, they traverse the wind, and sword and self arrive as one. The Water Sword Immortal, refined from a water immortal, is called *Water Sword Immortal*—without water, they cannot soar. The Fire Sword Immortal, whose practice begins with self-immolation, is also called *Fire Light Samadhi*; once the dagger-sword is complete, to take flight they must transform into a ball of fire, riding it to and fro—hence the name *Fire Sword Immortal*. The Qi Sword Immortal focuses solely on settling the breath and refining qi, forging the essence-brilliance into a sword; once the sword is formed of qi, they wield it to come and go—this is called the *Qi Sword*. The Ghost Sword Immortal is unseen in form, having cultivated the ink-water form of spirit immortals; their ink-water sword moves as qi, indistinguishable in its comings and goings. The Encountered-Sword Immortal, having chanced upon a treasured sword, may transform and manifest at will.

Lord Ye says: "To forge a sword, first gather the essence-brilliance, then arouse the heart-fire. The lungs are the wind-bellows, the liver-wood the charcoal, the spleen the yellow clay, and the kidneys the essence of sun and moon. The kidneys are water, the spleen-earth the clay; mold the body into a furnace, and within a single breath lies the method. The breath completes the sword’s qi. Grind it upon the gallbladder. The heart is fire; refine the essence-brilliance within and temper it. Grind it nine times upon the gallbladder—with each grinding, the liver’s blood stains it, hence the saying, *‘Ye Han iron is wrought’*—this is the essence-brilliance. Grind with lion’s gall and Lishui gold grains; when the heart-fire blazes, the lungs act as the refining fire, and molten gold drips onto the sword. Wash and grind with flood-dragon blood, which stains with the liver’s blood. If forging a metal hammer, the method differs: each day, swallow the brilliance of sun and moon, directing it to the lung viscera. The lungs correspond to metal, hence the name *gold hammer*. Yet when the gold hammer emerges, it should be yellow gold—why, when the lungs correspond to white? The lung viscera are the child of the spleen; the lungs govern snivel. When one swallows the brilliance of sun and moon and directs it to the lungs, after twelve months, arouse the heart-fire to cast it. Fire overcomes metal, so it melts at once. The spleen is earth, the mold—this is called *‘the child returning to the mother,’* taking on the mother’s form. The spleen’s yellow qi rises, resisting the fire’s power, and only then is the gold hammer complete. Those who successfully forge a sword become ranked immortals. The hero of resolve roams the Four Heavens and the cosmos, redressing wrongs so that none may act unjustly. Whoever encounters them and receives the gold hammer or dagger-sword gains spiritual powers.

Refine the essence of the five viscera, filling each to the count of eighty-one. The golden tripod gathers their qi, and the body ascends to transcend the heavens.

Master Luo says: "To refine the qi of the five viscera: when water arises in the seventh month, refine the kidneys; when wood arises at the onset of winter in the tenth month, refine the liver; when fire arises in the first month, refine the heart; when metal arises in the fourth month, refine the lungs; earth flourishes in the four seasons, so the spleen’s qi may be refined at any time. Each qi requires eighty-one days; when all five are complete, one moves freely in entry and exit. From the five fingers of either hand, five-colored light may shine; or from the crown of the head or beneath the feet, five clouds may gather—thus one ascends to heaven!

Lord Ye says: "Once the qi of the five viscera is complete, even if one has not yet paid homage to the Supreme Emperor, one may ride it to roam the Four Heavens, unobstructed and free. If one waits for the celestial summons of the Supreme Emperor before ascending, the body soars to heaven, dwelling beyond the mundane. The sagely body departs the dust of the world, silent and unbroken. In samadhi, one may re-enter the womb, cultivating anew and forming again. In one cycle, four bodies transform. Gradually, following the prior method, manifestations become boundless—this is called *true transformation*. This method follows natural completion, never reversing course.

Master Luo says: "Not reversing course means neither self-immolation nor expelling the Three Corpses and Nine Worms. There is another method: refining the form through self-immolation, transforming fire from the feet to the crown, visualizing it as crimson flame enveloping the body. Imagine the Three Corpses, Nine Worms, and Seven Po all departing—this is *reversed transformation*. Yet both methods lead to attaining the Dao. The Three Corpses, Nine Worms, and Seven Po all ascend to heaven together.

Lord Ye says: "The natural course arrives at the great limit; without contention, fire resists transformation. Or, using samadhi to settle the breath, ghosts and spirits submit of their own accord. Or, using samadhi to transform fire, the sun’s flame illuminates the earth. Or, shifting one’s dwelling to avoid it—this is called *natural completion*, never reversing course. Those who study this must be steadfast in resolve. This scripture must not be transmitted to the unworthy.

Master Luo says: "Lest later generations fail to understand, diagrams are appended. Those who transmit this must first purify themselves on an *jiazi* or *jiawu* day, face north, and perform rites before passing it on. The transmitter is the master; the receiver, the disciple. Should either violate this, they incur grave transgression."

The *Direct Dragon-Tiger Nine Immortals Scripture* concludes.
