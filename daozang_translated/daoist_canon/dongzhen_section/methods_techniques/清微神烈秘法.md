### *The Esoteric Divine Thunder Rites of Qingwei, Fascicle One*
#### *Arcane Discourse on Thunder*

The Qingwei, when described by analogy, is the most revered among the myriad heavens of the Great Luo, the Jade Capital of the Yu Mountain atop the Yu Terrace of the Uppermost Great Luo, and the Jade Purity of the Primordial Uppermost Great Luo. It originates before the division of the primordial chaos, the vast expanse, and the undifferentiated hồng-mông, within the realm of the Great Brahmā and the Great Beginning—precisely where the Most High Primordial Lord presides. It is the luminous inception of the primordial *qi* at the dawn of the ancestral kalpa, known as the Root of Heaven.

The Qingwei Method is none other than the Divine Empyrean under another name, a sublime practice within the Dao. The Dao is the ancestor of all methods, and Thunder is the sovereign of all thunders—not merely a method among methods. Thus, it inherits the primordial *qi* of the Primordial Lord, governing the myriad spirits. It further manifests distinct forms of the Three *Qi* of Brahmā, Pure, and Radiant, bearing alternate names such as the Crimson, Azure, Jade, Vermilion, Purple, and Supreme Divine.

Within this method, thunder talismans, jade scriptures, and celestial canons all naturally coalesced from the Brahmā-*qi* in the vastness of the firmament at the dawn of the kalpa. In ancient times, the Primordial Lord descended and commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to transcribe their texts with a brush—each character a *zhang* in length—concealing them within the Golden Portal of the Jade Capital of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, entrusted to the Five Elder Thearchs. These Upper Grade Spirit Scriptures serve to regulate the kalpic cycles, give rise to heaven and establish earth, govern the movements of water and fire, enlighten the divine, and stand as the origin of all Daoist methods. Transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas, they are revealed to the celestial and human.

The Middle Grade Scriptures are concealed within the dragon palaces and oceanic treasuries of the Five Marchmounts and Four Watercourses, entrusted to their respective deities. They stabilize and pacify the marchmounts and watercourses, open the sources of springs, summon dragons to bear water, and command the divine hosts of the Divine Empyrean. Transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas, they are revealed to the divine and human.

The Lower Grade Spirit Scriptures are transmitted among the lineage masters of the world, passed heart-to-heart and mouth-to-mouth, enduring as long as heaven itself. They pray for celestial blessings upon the state, propagate the Dao to transform the people, command thunder and lightning, summon wind and rain at will, vanquish malevolent spirits, alleviate drought and flood, deliver the living and the dead, and aid the sovereign and the people. Such is the wondrous Dao of the Qingwei Thunder Rites practiced in the world today. Truly unlike any other method, the enlightened, upon hearing it once, attain sudden realization.

For the Five Phases, *geng* is sovereign; for the Five *Qi*, the One is the ancestor; for the myriad methods, the mind is the standard. This method is simple and effortless, neither clinging to deliberate action nor falling into non-action. It rejects forced visualization, hollow formalities, sacrifices, prayers, and supplications—all of which are but flattery and deception. Its wonder lies in the fusion of one’s spirit with the other spirit, one’s numen with the other numen, which the Confucian classics call "extending knowledge to investigate things."

In the daily conduct of the four dignified postures—moving, dwelling, sitting, and reclining—one must gather and restrain body and mind, instantly stilling the myriad thoughts. Abide in non-abiding, preserve non-preservation, and maintain an unbroken true thought. As if in the undivided chaos before the emergence of the Supreme Ultimate, within the empty void and the circular radiance, there is a single aperture—vast without exterior, minute without interior. Before the Supreme Ultimate divided, chaos was uniform; body and mind dissolve, leaving only a single point in the Great Void. The numinous luminosity naturally illumines the ten directions. The field of the heart is unstained, the ground of nature free from dust. With time, stillness prevails, and responsiveness arises spontaneously.

At this stage, with a single glance or thought, the generals and marshals abound, as if present at one’s side. In stillness, it is the Dao; in motion, it is the method. With the mouth opened and the heart preserved, clarity and resonance manifest immediately. This is the root of the Great Dao, the origin of the myriad methods. Only through unwavering singularity from beginning to end, with thoughts unbroken in the four dignified postures, does one enter the unobstructed—this is the accomplishment of the perfected.

### *Meditation and Seated Practice*

In all moments of seated meditation and regulated breath, one abides as if in the primordial state before the division of the Great Ultimate and the chaos, within the vast emptiness and the radiant orb of light. Or again, as if dwelling within the single aperture of that orb of light, where the Great Ultimate remains undivided—body and mind utterly dissolved, yet a single spark of numinous light persists, neither within nor without, limpid and profound, illumining the ten directions in boundless radiance, unfathomable even to heaven and earth. Morning and evening seated meditation alike serve as practice and application.

If the response is not forthcoming, use an iron tablet and first submit an imperial memorial to the Dragon Pool. The master reviews and opens the talisman before lowering the tablet.

**Tablet Formula**
Memorial: *"By imperial edict, the Three Ministries are charged to first rectify the celestial divisions and pardon transgressions. Proclaim this to the Dragon Lord of [State], [County], [Location] Pool-Cave. You are commanded to obey the originally descended [Tablet] and act with utmost urgency. Your servant, now at the altar of [Location], prostrates to await universal grace."*

*Year, Month, First Day, Hour—Decree Issued.*

The iron tablet is one foot two inches in length and five inches two fen in width. Inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on the front and the text on the reverse, then place it in a blue silk pouch before submerging it in water. Further command the Dragon Lord of [Location] Pool-Cave to obey the tablet and act with haste.

The master burns the talisman and lowers it into the pool, wielding the sword to spray water while reciting the incantation:
*"Heaven descends in brilliance, Earth ascends in compliance. Spirits obey, thunder is driven forth. Lightning turns the celestial stars to smite the rebellious and defiant. Dragon deities descend in universal grace—benefit, advantage, harmony, and uprightness."*

**Pouch Formula**
Made of blue silk; if unavailable, blue damask may be used.

**Iron Tablet Talisman**
Inscribed in cinnabar on the reverse of the tablet:
*"Vast Qi of the Pure and Subtle Heaven, pervading the Dao with boundless grace—Golden Talisman, Iron Tablet. Reverently following the originally descended decree, the mandate is issued."*

*Right: Golden Talisman, Iron Tablet—Proclaimed to the Dragon Deity of [State], [County], [Location] Pool-Cave. You are commanded to obey the originally descended tablet mandate. On the [Day] of this month at [Hour], lead the dragon-thunder to descend upon [Location], summon clouds to bring rain, unleash great thunderclaps, rescue the parched people, saturate the fields, and benefit all things. On the day of merit, your name shall be recorded in the Upper Clarity Register of this altar. Beyond the already recorded words, a memorial shall be swiftly submitted to the Celestial Court to request the bestowal of imperial grace. Upon receipt of this external tablet mandate, command the swift stars to immediately await the luminous report."*

*Year, Month, First Day, Hour—Decree Issued.*

**Lowering the Tablet Talisman**
Inscribed in cinnabar on blue or plain silk:
*"Your servant [Name], bearing the decree, obeys and executes."*

Summon the Three Celestial Thunderclaps, swiftly submit the dark memorial, and let the talisman envoy Kong An-tian descend. The incantation is complete and potent. Donning a fiery crown for three days, with a blue-green face, crimson hair, clad in golden armor and vermilion robes, wielding a sword, holding the talisman, wearing vermilion shoes, and riding a red phoenix.

Summon the talisman envoy. The memorial commissions the talisman envoy, who bears the tablet mandate to proclaim its descent. Once the Dragon Lord is summoned and the memorial is read, burn the talisman. Thereafter, dispatch and command, ensuring timely and luminous report—do not delay or disobey. On the day of merit, your name shall be recorded in the Upper Clarity.

Recite the incantation:
*"Heaven descends its crystalline essence to Earth,
In accord with the numinous, drive forth the thunder.
The thunder moves the celestial stars,
Punishing the rebellious and countermanding fate.
The Dragon Spirit descends universally,
Bestowing moisture, harmony, and steadfast integrity."*

Cast the tablet into the water.

**First Step:** Establish the altar petition, following the recent precedents of the Four Masters.
**○ Enter the Flying [Memorial]**
Next, don the armor, and perform the Three Thunder Rites as prescribed. Use yellow paper, nine inches in height and five inches in width, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar, annotate in ink, and bind it with silk thread. Burn it in the center, or within the incense burner. Invoke the Thunder Spirit.

Recite the Heavenly Scripture, inscribing the talisman in ink:
*"This talisman is for [Location] and the petition therein prostrated. Since [Month], there has been prolonged drought without rain; the fields are cracked like tortoise shells, the crops wither, the people’s hearts are anxious, and the year’s harvest is feared lost. We knock our heads and beseech, pleading for rain—this matter is urgent. The petition’s words are earnest and impassioned, its intent too pressing to suppress. We proceed in accordance with the prescribed rites to proclaim and enact this. The originally descended Jade Talisman has been respectfully invoked."*

To the mighty and divine Lords of Yin and Yang, Gou and Bi, assemble with haste. Patrol by day, govern by year—the Thunder Spirits, the Masters of Rain, and the Dragon Lords of this realm’s mountains, rivers, deep pools, and caverns, along with the Earth Gods and Local Deities. On the appointed day and hour of this month, descend to [Location], summon the dragons to coil the waters, ride the winds and lash the thunder, and bestow three days of sweet rain to universally succor all beings across the four outskirts. Above, manifest the transformative power of the Dao; below, fulfill the people’s plea. Await the response in reverence, that the celestial trust be made manifest.

One Supreme Ultimate, Two Flying Warriors, Three Armored Guardians, Six Rain, Seven Thunder, Startling Nine Thunder. Recite the Heavenly Scripture, inscribe ten revolutions.

Second stage: write in ink on yellow paper, bind with silk thread, and burn in a blazing fire beneath the open sky.

Recite the Heavenly Scripture, inscribing the talisman in ink:
*"This talisman is for [Location] and [Petitioner], who prostrates in plea for rain to rescue the fields and crops."*

Your servant, having received the petition, has already commissioned the Thunder Spirits to assemble with the Rain Deities, the Dragon Lords of mountains, rivers, deep pools, and caverns, and the Earth Gods and Local Deities, setting a fixed term for the great bestowal of sweet rain. Should there be any delay or obstruction to the timely relief of the drought, this further proclamation is issued without fail.

The originally descended Jade Talisman urgently invokes the mighty and divine Lords of Yin and Yang, Gou and Bi. Ensure they respond on schedule, commanding the Thunder Spirits of the yearly cycle, the Dragon Lords of the daily patrol, and the deities of mountains, rivers, deep pools, caverns, and local altars to uniformly obey the talismanic decree. Let them send forth rain and summon clouds, dispel the drought demons to save the withered, aid the living beings, and revive all things. May they extend the virtue of cherishing life, descending to rescue the dying crops with abundant sweet rain, that the great work of Heaven’s mandate be gloriously fulfilled.

All the above talismans are for subduing great demons and malevolent spirits, to be employed in urgent or critical situations.

Bear this solemnly in mind.

Inscribe in cinnabar and ink on paper, bind with thread, and burn in fierce fire where exposed to heaven. Alternatively, use large incense tablets, inscribing the directive on the reverse.

Heavenly deities, earthly spirits, lords of the Three Realms, village deities, city gods, and local spirit-officials—all must obey and execute. Those who defy shall be slain and their corpses severed.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and commands!"*

**Reverse Inscription for Vanquishing Spirits:**
*"Qian descends as crystal, Kun aligns with the numinous sun and moon.
Embodying mountains and rivers, commanding thunder and lightning, celestial stars shatter evil.
Smooth and steadfast, correct and upright.
As in the imperial decree."*

**Right:** For suppressing major malevolent spirits, quelling floods, invoking dragon-led rains, and subduing flood dragons, water monsters, and aquatic specters.
Use an iron plaque, one *chi* and two *cun* in length, three *cun* and two *fen* in width, and two *fen* in thickness. Inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on the front, with the *Three Caverns’ Decrees*. On the reverse, write the *"Qian Descends as Crystal"* decree or the rain-invoking writ. To suppress evil, place it where needed, and all disturbances will naturally dissipate. For deep pools where flood dragons or water monsters wreak havoc, or where malevolent ghosts seize lives to substitute for their own deaths, this plaque will subdue and pacify them, bringing tranquility to the land. If prayers go unanswered, inscribe the talisman as prescribed and cast it into dragon-inhabited pools or caves—clouds will gather, and rain will follow.

**Primordial Beginning’s Hidden Sanskrit Great Thunderbolt Talisman**
The reverse inscription is as above. Use this to suppress minor demons, sprites, flood dragons, fish-dragons, and riverbank collapses—all will be subdued. For places plagued by spring specters, water monsters, or any malevolent spirits, employ this talisman, and the evil will flee a thousand *li* away.

*Qingwei* Celestial Treasure House Epistle
The dharma-heir, great-grandson of the lineage, [Name], today having thrice purified with ink and ninefold bathed, prostrates in reverence.

This letter is respectfully presented before the Jade Void Preceptor, the August Supreme Heavenly Venerable One, Lord of the Primordial Unity.

I, a mere speck of dust, a minor functionary within the Dao, humbly rely upon the shelter of the Way’s grace, serving day and night in the thunder ranks, yet harboring boundless anxiety over my inability to repay such favor.

Recently, on behalf of [Person] from [Place] regarding [Matter], I received their plea, which could not be refused. Reflecting on my transmission of the dharma lineage, I recognize that in my practice, my virtue is meager while my responsibilities are weighty, my transgressions many and my merits few. Now, the urgency of this matter brooks no negligence.

I humbly implore the compassion of the Dao, that it may be as the primordial decree. This humble letter is respectfully submitted for your attention, beseeching your merciful regard. May the dharma lineage be specially favored, and may the imperial court be petitioned to issue a decree of deliverance.

Proclamation is hereby issued to [Name] Thunder Deity, setting the appointed time as the [Day] of this month at [Hour], to descend to [Location] and render due retribution. May this ensure the flourishing of the Great Dao and the turning of humans and heavens toward reverence.

I, in my temerity, have trespassed upon imperial majesty, and am overwhelmed with trepidation. Humbly I implore your pardon, leaving further words unspoken.

Respectfully submitted on the [Day] of the [Month] and [Year] by [Name], humble descendant of the dharma lineage.

**Outer Seal:**
This letter is of urgent and confidential matter—its contents must not be lightly disclosed. By the true mandate of the Emperor, communion through prayer is sought.

The words herein are few, written in ink on plain paper, sealed with a horn closure and bound with five-colored silk threads. Entrusted to the Thunder Lords Gou and Bi for transmission and presentation.
