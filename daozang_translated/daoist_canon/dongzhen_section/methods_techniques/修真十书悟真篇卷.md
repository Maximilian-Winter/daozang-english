# 修真十书悟真篇卷

**The Twenty-Sixth Scroll of *Wuzhen Pian* from *The Ten Books on Cultivating the True*: Preface to *Wuzhen Pian***

Alas! The human body is hard to obtain, yet time flees like light and shadow, its brevity unfathomable. How can one escape karmic retribution without early awakening, content merely to await life’s end? Should a single misguided thought arise at the crossroads, one may fall into the three evil destinies, drifting for eons without hope of emergence. At such a moment, though regret may come, what use is it?

Thus, the Daoist and Buddhist sages opened the gate of expedient means through the study of *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life), teaching people to cultivate the seed of transcendence and escape the cycle of birth and death. Buddhism takes emptiness and quiescence as its foundation; if one attains sudden enlightenment and perfect penetration, one may directly cross to the other shore. Yet if habitual defilements remain, one still clings to conditioned existence. Daoism regards refinement and nurturance as the true path; if one grasps its essential pivot, one may ascend to sagehood in an instant. But if one fails to awaken to original nature, one remains bound to illusory form.

Next, the *Book of Changes* contains teachings on exhausting principle, perfecting nature, and fulfilling destiny, while the *Analects of Lu* speaks of relinquishing willfulness, certainty, stubbornness, and ego—Confucius thus attained the profoundest mysteries of *xing* and *ming*. Yet why are his words often brief and lacking in detail? It is because his aim was to order human relationships and propagate the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and music. Thus, he never explicitly expounded the Dao of non-action, but instead embedded the arts of destiny within the images of the *Changes* and concealed the principles of nature within subtle words.

As for Zhuangzi, who explored the freedom from worldly entanglements, and Mencius, who excelled in nurturing the vast *qi*, both touched upon the subtleties of the Way. Later, during the Han, Wei Boyang subtly wove the principles of the *Changes* into the dynamics of yin-yang intercourse, composing the *Cantong Qi* to elucidate the workings of the Great Elixir. In the Tang, Master Zhongli Quan, in his recorded sayings, first clarified the words of Laozi and Zhuangzi to reveal the root and branches of the supreme Dao. Thus, though the teachings diverge into three, the Dao ultimately returns to one.

Yet how lamentable that later generations of Daoist and Buddhist practitioners, each clinging to their own sect, have mutually disparaged one another, causing the essential doctrines of the three traditions to become obscured by heterodox paths, unable to merge and return to unity.

Moreover, people today assume that the Daoist path emphasizes the cultivation of *ming* (life), yet they do not realize that the methods for cultivating *ming* branch into two paths: one that is easily encountered but difficult to accomplish, and another that is difficult to encounter but easy to accomplish. Practices such as refining the *qi* of the five sprouts, absorbing the radiance of the seven luminaries, visualizing and massaging, inhaling the pure and exhaling the turbid, reciting scriptures and chanting mantras, spraying water and shouting talismans, clicking teeth to gather spirits, abandoning wives and fasting, preserving spirit and holding breath, employing thoughts between the eyebrows to replenish the brain and return essence, or practicing bedroom arts—along with ingesting and refining minerals, herbs, and the like—all belong to the category of the easily encountered yet difficult to accomplish.

If one exerts great effort in the above methods, they often fragment the path of self-cultivation, yielding little result despite strenuous labor. Though diligent practice may ward off illness and avert misfortune, once discontinued, prior efforts gradually dissipate. This merely prolongs the years, making success ever more elusive. How then can one hope for a single attainment to become permanent, to reverse aging and return to youth, to transform and ascend in flight? The prospect is indeed remote—deeply grievous and lamentable.

Most modern practitioners, deluded and attached, fail to grasp the truth of the wondrous method and instead blame the immortals for deception. Little do they know that all who attain the Dao do so through the refinement of the Golden Elixir, yet fearing the leakage of celestial secrets, they veil the truth under various guises. Among these, only the method of breath-holding, if practiced with utter detachment from worldly concerns, resembles the seated meditation of the Two Vehicles. With diligent practice, one may enter samadhi and project the spirit. Yet since spirit belongs to yin and the bodily abode is hard to stabilize, one must perpetually employ shifting techniques. Without mastering the way of returning mercury and lead, how can one reverse yang, transform the bones, and ascend to heaven in broad daylight?

The refinement of the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, however, is difficult to encounter yet easy to accomplish. One must thoroughly comprehend yin and yang, deeply penetrate the workings of creation, then transcend the two *qi* within the Yellow Path, unite the three natures in the Primordial Palace, gather the five phases, harmonize the four images, evoke the dragon’s roar and the tiger’s howl, ensure husband leads and wife follows, heat the Jade Crucible with simmering broth, and ignite the Golden Furnace with blazing fire. Only then will the Mysterious Pearl take form, the Great One return to the True, and in but a moment’s effort, one secure boundless and eternal bliss.

As for guarding against danger and anticipating peril, one must be cautious in the operations of withdrawal and addition; in nurturing correctness and maintaining fullness, the key lies in embracing the feminine and holding to the One. Naturally, the *qi* of returning yang will arise, the form of vanquished yin will dissolve, and once the cyclical nodes are complete, one will shed the mortal coil through spiritual transformation, inscribe one’s name in the immortal register, and assume one’s titled rank. This is the moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name established.

Yet today’s scholars take lead and mercury as the two *qi*, designate the viscera as the five phases, split heart and kidney into Kan and Li, assign liver and lungs as dragon and tiger, regard spirit and *qi* as mother and child, and cling to bodily fluids as lead and mercury. Unaware of floating and sinking, how can they distinguish host and guest? This is no different from mistaking another’s wealth for one’s own or calling a stranger’s child one’s kin. How could they fathom the subtle interplay of metal and wood’s mutual overcoming or the profound mysteries of yin and yang’s reciprocal employment? Such errors arise from the sun and moon straying from their paths, lead and mercury being cast into separate crucibles. How then can they hope to congeal the Returning Elixir? The goal is indeed distant.

From youth, I have been devoted to the Dao, delving into the scriptures of the Three Teachings, as well as works on penal law, divination, medicine, military strategy, astronomy, geography, and the arts of fortune and misfortune, life and death—nothing has escaped my careful study. Yet regarding the method of the Golden Elixir, though I have perused all the alchemical classics and the songs, poems, and treatises of various masters, all speak of the sun’s essence and the moon’s spirit, of Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon, of mercury and cinnabar, of silver and lead, of Kan male and Li female, claiming these can produce the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir. Yet none reveal what true lead and true mercury truly are, nor do they explain the methods of fire phases, the degrees of refinement, or the aims of nurturing and preservation.

Worse still, later generations of deluded practitioners, indulging their whims, have wantonly annotated the sacred teachings of the ancient sages, introducing myriad distortions. Not only do they confound the immortal classics, but they also mislead future learners.

Having failed to meet a perfected one and seldom encountered oral instructions, I fell into restless days and sleepless nights, my spirit worn and weary. Though I sought counsel across mountains and seas, inquired of the wise and the foolish alike, none could clarify the true essence or illuminate the depths of my heart.

Later, in the year *jiyou* of the Xining reign (1069), while accompanying Minister Lu of the Dragon Diagram to Chengdu, my resolve unshaken and my devotion unwavering, I was at last favored by a true immortal, who bestowed upon me the secrets of the Golden Elixir’s ingredients and fire phases. His words were concise, his essentials uncluttered—pointing to the stream to reveal the source, uttering one to awaken a hundred. Like mist dispersing to reveal the sun’s brilliance, like dust settling to mirror clarity, his teachings aligned with the immortal classics as if matching tally tokens.

Reflecting that of ten thousand who pursue immortality, scarcely one or two grasp the true essentials, how could I, having encountered the authentic guide, dare remain silent? I poured forth all I had received, composing eighty-one regulated verses in nine sets of nine, titled *Awakening to Reality*. Among them are sixteen heptasyllabic quatrains to represent the two eights, sixty-four jueju verses corresponding to the hexagrams of the *Book of Changes*, and one pentasyllabic poem to symbolize the Great Unity. Twelve additional *Moon over the West River* lyrics complete the cycle of the year’s twelve months. Within these are fully expounded the hierarchy of the crucible, the weights of the ingredients, the advance and retreat of the fire phases, the precedence of host and guest, the interplay of existence and void, and the auspices of fortune and misfortune.

Yet as the nature of original true awakening remained incompletely expressed, I appended songs, ballads, and miscellaneous verses to the end of the scroll, that the Way of realizing the root and illuminating the nature might be wholly contained herein. May those of like aspiration, upon reading these words, perceive the branch and awaken to the root, forsake delusion to follow truth.

Written on New Year’s Day of the *yimao* year of the Xining reign (1075), by Zhang Boduan Pingshu of Tiantai.

Yang Section

The True Earth—Yin Mercury, Lead—comprises the three wives and ministers: flowing pearls of quicksilver, divine water of the jade maid, the alchemical maiden, the Mysterious Woman, the Wooden Maid, white snow, the azure-eyed Hu boy, the green-robed maiden, the Eastern Sea’s Azure Dragon, the crisscrossing pear, floating yin fire, the white guest, the people’s son, the celestial soul, the cinnabar foundation, the black turtle essence, true yin within yang, the lower crescent’s half-catty of silver. These are the variant names for mercury:

Golden Elixir, Great Elixir, Internal Elixir, Reverted Elixir, Divine Elixir, True Lead, Great Medicine, Infant Vision, Valley Spirit, Sacred Embryo, Knife-Tip, Sevenfold Return, Jade Flask Elixir, Purple Gold Elixir, Blade-Snow Elixir, Vermilion Radiance Golden Elixir, Dragon-Tiger Great Medicine, Golden Liquid Reverted Elixir, Jade Liquid Reverted Elixir, Ninefold Transmutation Elixir, Purple Gold Frost, True Yellow Sprout, True Yin-Yang, True Mysterious Female, True Father-Mother, True Dragon-Tiger, True Seed, True Master, True Lead-Mercury, the One, Master of the Cosmos, Autumn Stone, River Chariot, Golden Duke, Golden Consort, Yang Elixir, Golden Fish Lord, Yellow Boy, Three-Five-One Beauty, Golden Flower, Treasury Pearl, White Horse Tooth, Water’s Gold, Jade Medicine, Golden Sand, Divine Talisman, White Snow, Running Essence, Phoenix’s Longevity, Rabbit’s Mortality, Crow’s Liver, Sun’s Soul, Moon’s Spirit, the Pot’s Sun and Moon, Premature Earth Essence, Grand Unity’s Contained True Qi.

Lead—the Merchant Lord, Golden Maid, Golden Florescence, Jade Pool, Flowery Pond, Infant, Yellow Boy, Golden Essence, Yellow Sprout, White-Haired Elder, Plain-Silk Gentleman, Western Mountain’s White Tiger, Fire Date, Sinking Yellow Sprout, Lead Master, Father-Mother, Earthly Spirit, Cinnabar Mother, the Vermilion Phoenix’s Body, true yang within yin, the upper crescent’s eight taels of gold. These are the variant names for lead.

The crucible measures one foot five inches in circumference, five inches hollow at the center, and twelve inches in length. Its form resembles Penglai’s gourd, or the human body’s shape. Divided into three tiers, it corresponds to the Three Powers. The fish’s body and belly are straight and unobstructed, ensuring uniformity in upper, middle, and lower sections. Eight inches are placed within the furnace, suspended in the crucible without touching the ground—this is the "suspended embryo." It is also called the Cinnabar Fish; Zhang Sui’s annotation states: it is further named the Grand Unity’s Divine Crucible.

*To the tune of "Man Ting Fang"*
The true iron ox of *dui*,
Ugly in form, stubborn in nature,
Ever fond of contention and racing.

Each person possesses it—who knows how to ride and guide it?
Plant the golden sprout to fill the courtyard, then irrigate it with divine water.
The Central Palace’s farmer, without this beast, how could one resemble the infant?
Heaven and Earth, in true movement and stillness, all life and vitality depend on it—
The iron ox’s vigor, the tiger’s strength, lifting to drink from the mercury pool.
At midnight, lead the chariot to stoke the fire; thunder’s light bursts forth,
Radiance surging from the ocean’s depths.
The shepherd boy laughs, the Flowery Pond’s feast concluded,
Riding the moonlit crucible home beneath the slanting moon.

The crucible’s face measures about one foot two inches in circumference,
Its bright center spanning one foot across.
A raised rim encircles it, two inches in height, two inches in thickness.
The crucible’s mouth opens like an upturned cauldron or an inverted moon—
Hence its name, the Inverted Moon Crucible.
Zhang Sui’s annotation states: it is also called the Radiant Might Tripod.

*Arranging the Four Symbols to Generate True Earth*
The Azure Dragon of the East, the White Tiger of the West,
The Vermilion Bird of the South, the Dark Warrior of the North.
The four fierce beasts, unstoppable in might,
The strategizing general commands their force.
Seized in both hands as they clash in battle,
One sees the mid-autumn moon at high noon.
A murderous aura shakes heaven and stirs ghosts and spirits,
Exhausting the celestial cycles to shake the cosmos.
In an instant, the battle ceases, weapons sheathed—
A luminous pearl is born, called True Earth.

*Lead-Refining Fire Timing*
Thirty civil, seventy martial,
Two hundred sixty parts make the bright number.
Begin and end with martial firing,
While the middle is gently simmered with civil fire.
From the crucible emerges a five-colored radiance,
A single brilliant grain, large as a millet seed.
Placed upon the palm and swallowed whole,
One roams freely as a true immortal.

*Six Hundred Fire Records*
Six hundred fire records, ten months like a turning wheel.
Morning and evening, each a hexagram—
*Zhun* and *Meng* chase one another.
At midnight, kindle the yang fire,
Two hundred sixteen in count.
At noon, raise the yin lines,
Eighteen times eight, complete.
Lead dissolves, mercury dries,
Black vapor—now the elixir is ripe.
Yin exhausted, pure yang transformed,
The body’s form like jade.

*Bathing*
Criminal and virtuous forces share in life and death,
Applied to the two gates of eight.
Cinnabar should be bathed,
Divine water pours over the numinous root.
Seal the orifices to retain gold and mercury,
Guard the passes to nurture soul and spirit.
No need to tend the fire—
Within the crucible, warmth arises naturally.

*Embracing the One*
After the nation’s wealth and the people’s peace,
The refined body belongs to Qian.
Concentrate the spirit to return to the wondrous Dao,
Embrace the One and guard the cinnabar field.
Coming and going without hindrance,
Ascending and soaring as nature wills.
When nine years of work are complete,
One strides alone as a Great Luo immortal.

*Seventeen Quatrains in Seven Characters*
One...

Do not seek the Great Dao to escape the maze of delusion—
Even with worthy talent, how can one be a true man?
A hundred years of light flash like sparks from stone,
A lifetime’s fate floats like bubbles on water.
Only coveting profit and rank, seeking glory and display,
Heedless of the body’s form withering in silent decay.
Try asking: though gold be piled like mountains,
Can impermanence be bought to never come?

II
Though human life may span a hundred years,
Longevity or early death, poverty or success—none can foreknow.
Yesterday he rode a horse through the streets,
Today his corpse lies still within the coffin.
Wealth and wives left behind are not truly his,
The karmic deeds he carries deceive not even himself.
If the Great Elixir is not sought, how can one chance upon it?
To encounter it yet fail to refine it is utter folly.

These two chapters the Perfected One sets forth to awaken the world,
Lest any be left behind—thus they stand at the beginning.

III
To study immortality, one must study the immortality of Heaven.
Ye Shibiao says: Among the thousand kinds of immortals,
The Heavenly Immortal unites form and spirit in wondrous perfection,
Harmonizing with the Dao in truth.
When gathered, they take form; when dispersed, they become qi.
Those who cultivate this Way must make inner and outer void and luminous,
Transparent within and without.
Should even a speck of dust arise, leakage will occur.
Only the Golden Elixir is most certain and true.

Li Quan says: Though the refinements of the Returned Elixir number in the hundreds,
This is called the Golden Elixir—the Great Returned Elixir of Golden Fluid.
The *Cantong Qi* states: When gold returns to the original nature,
Only then is it called the Returned Elixir.
For gold is the mother of the medicine,
And when gold emits its fluid to return to the cinnabar field,
It is called the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir.

Master Wei Lü’s *Precelestial Great Learning* says:
The Golden Elixir is the ancestor of the primordial qi,
From which the postcelestial generates the Two Modes and the Three Powers,
The mother of the myriad things.
The *Book of Changes* says: Qian’s origin is that which begins and brings to fruition.
The myriad things rely on it to begin,
It bestows bountiful benefit upon the world yet does not speak of its beneficence.
Possessing the virtue of firmness, strength, centrality, and purity,
Its work complete, it retreats to a humble position.
Qian resides in the position of Hai,
Lodged within the body of northern water—
This is the central line of Kan.
The sage can return to the root and restore life,
Uniting with the primordial spirit and the Dao,
Endlessly generating—encompassing all images,
This is called “obtaining the One.”
Thus it is forcibly named “Elixir,” not an empty derivation.
This is the transformation of Qian’s Dao,
The unfathomable interplay of yin and yang.
It embodies the supreme, most true wonder of the Great Ultimate,
Encompassing the origin of nature and life.
The *Inner Book of Changes* says: The meaning of the central line is called creation and transformation.
The *Scripture of the Golden and Azure* says: The Spirit Chamber is the pivot of the Elixir,
Located in the one-two count of Kan and Li.
The *Cantong Qi* says: When gold returns to the original nature,
Only then is it called the Returned Elixir.
This is the Golden Fluid’s return to truth,
The Way of uniting form and spirit in wondrous perfection—
Utterly simple, utterly easy.
Once attained, it is forever attained.
Thus the myriad discourses and thousand scriptures,
Able to transform and naturally generate spirit,
If one obtains their oral transmission,
Even the most foolish and lowly may at once ascend to sagehood.
Therefore the celestial mechanism is guarded in secrecy,
Never to be transmitted to the unworthy.
To lightly divulge or recklessly transmit it
Brings calamity upon nine generations.
Thus know that the Golden Elixir is the supreme, most true path.

When the two substances meet, emotion and nature unite,
When the Five Phases are complete, tiger and dragon coil.
True One Master says: Gold is emotion; water is nature.
Gold is born of water, just as emotion arises from nature;
Water is concealed within gold, just as emotion returns to nature.
Or one may ask: If gold is the mother, how can it be called emotion?
Yet the *Cantong Qi* says: Gold is the mother of water—
The mother is concealed within the child.
When they meet, gold and water merge;
When fully gathered, tiger and dragon coil.
Thus the next chapter says:
Once the two substances are driven into the Yellow Path,
How can the numinous elixir fail to be born?

The *Cantong Qi* says: Kan is water, the moon,
In man, the kidneys.
The kidneys generate essence,
Within which resides the true yang qi,
Flaming upward.
Essence is yin, qi is yang—
Thus lead is soft, silver is hard.
The tiger’s nature belongs to metal,
And metal can generate water.
Inverting the sequence, one takes it—
The mother concealed within the child’s womb,
Thus the tiger is born within water.
The tiger corresponds to lead,
The yang within yin.
Li is fire, the sun,
In man, the heart.
The heart generates blood,
Within which flows the true one’s fluid,
Descending downward.
Blood is yang, fluid is yin—
Thus cinnabar is yang, mercury is yin.
The dragon’s nature belongs to wood,
And wood can generate fire.
Inverting the sequence, one takes it—
The mother concealed within the child’s womb,
Thus the dragon emerges from within fire.
The dragon corresponds to mercury,
The yin within yang.

Originally, they rely on wu and ji as matchmakers,
Thus husband and wife are firmly united in joy.
Ye Shibiao says: Kan and Li receive wu and ji,
The qi of wu and ji within Kan and Li.
This speaks of the two substances, through the central qi’s ascent and descent,
Generating union and harmony.
Master Wuming says: Wu and ji belong to earth—
This is called the Yellow Dame.
Dragon and tiger, metal and wood, are separated by east and west;
The Yellow Dame brings them together—
Is this not matchmaking?

Only await the work’s completion to pay homage at the northern palace,
Within ninefold radiance, riding a propitious simurgh.

Only await the work’s completion to pay homage at the northern pass,
Within ninefold radiance, riding a propitious luan.

IV
This method is true within the true, most wondrous,
All because I alone differ from others.
I know the inversion arises from Li and Kan,
Who recognizes the floating and sinking to determine host and guest?
Ye Shibiao says: The five positions harmonize, their names conjoined.
Qian receives jia and ren, one and nine making ten;
Kun receives yi and gui, four and six making ten;
Gen and Zhen receive bing and geng, three and seven making ten;
Xun and Dui receive xin and ding, two and eight making ten;
Kan and Li receive wu and ji, together making fifteen.
Inverting above and below without change,
Thus all inversions and ascents depend upon them.

The mercury sinks, the lead floats—what sinks serves as host, what floats as guest.

○ Master Yuan Fubo says: Precisely because of this, the ancient perfected immortals and sagely worthies all knew that the inversion of yin and yang lies within the Kan and Li trigrams. Yet few in the world recognize the floating and sinking to determine host and guest. Thus Gao Xiangxian said: *"In all the world, none know the River Chariot."* The golden crucible seeks to retain cinnabar-wrapped mercury; the jade pool first descends with silver in water.

○ Ye Shibiao says: This speaks of the floating and sinking of host and guest. The fire of Li gives birth to mercury; the water of Kan gives birth to metal. Mercury coalesces through lead; lead subdues and tames mercury—this is the resonance of mother and child. The *Cantong Qi* states: *"The maiden by the river is numinous and most divine. When fire is applied, she takes flight, vanishing like dust. Spirits hide, dragons lie concealed—none know where she abides. To restrain her, use the yellow sprout as silver."*

True Yizi says: The yellow sprout is lead. These two lines directly correspond to the earlier discussion of the inversion of Kan and Li. The *Dayi Zhi Tu* states: *"That yin contains yang is like lead containing yin."* The yellow sprout is produced within the River Chariot.

A song says:
*"The yellow sprout, lead, and mercury refine,
Within yin’s husk, yang’s radiance shines."*

The purport of this passage is: One must first drive the dragon to descend and join the tiger’s qi, only then can the two qi intermingle, allowing the work of forging and refinement to proceed, coalescing into the essence of the True One.

Divine workings move the fire not through the whole night—
A single wheel of the sun emerges from the deep pool’s reflection.

○ Ye Shibiao says: Heaven and earth employ divine workings to generate the myriad things. If one can emulate heaven and earth by moving the talismanic fire, then without waiting between dawn and dusk, the yang radiance arises from the primordial sea. The Perfected One said: *"Within a single double-hour, the elixir is complete"*—this is the meaning.

○ The Nameless Master says: The fire is the qi of the two crescents. "Not through the whole night" clarifies that within a single double-hour, the golden elixir is accomplished. This is the method of the external medicine and its symbolic correspondences.

The tiger leaps, the dragon soars—wind and waves surge,
At the central true position, the Mystic Pearl is born.
Though fruit ripens on the branch, its time must come,
How different is the child within the womb?

○ Ye Shibiao says: The qi of Kan and Li are like cloud-dragons and wind-tigers, galloping and soaring. When they reach the Central Palace, the Primordial Pearl is produced. The Pearl is the Metal Mother, which gives birth to true mercury. As the *Cantong Qi* says of "warming and nurturing the child-pearl," it is like fruit growing on the branch or a child maturing in the womb, awaiting the fulfillment of its allotted time.

○ Yuan Gongfu says: The surging waves describe the untamed state of the two substances. Only when the Central Palace holds its true position can it draw in the essence of both, nurturing true mercury within—just as fruit ripens on the branch or a child grows in the womb, awaiting the completion of its term. The *Zisheng Jing* states: "Three inches below the navel lies the Lower Cinnabar Field, four inches square, nestled between the spine and the two kidneys. To the left, blue; to the right, white; above, yellow; below, black; at the center, red. It is called the Great Sea, storing blood and qi, and also the Great Center, for it is the exact midpoint of the body’s four directions. The central true position is the Golden Womb, the spirit-chamber of the Cinnabar Field."

North and South Schools reverse the hexagrams’ images,
Morning and evening fire-phases align with the Celestial Pivot.

○ Ye Shibiao says: Kan and Li, above and below, form the images of *Jiji* and *Weiji*. From dawn’s *Zhun* to dusk’s *Meng*, each corresponds to the pivot of heaven.

○ Xiangchuan Weng says: *Zi* is the head of the six yang, hence the morning, governed by the *Zhun* hexagram—its proper affair is the phase of advancing fire. *Wu* is the head of the six yin, hence the evening, governed by the *Meng* hexagram—its proper affair is the phase of advancing water. Within a single day, two hexagrams govern their affairs; over thirty days, the cycle concludes with the *Jiji* and *Weiji* hexagrams, then begins anew. Each day’s two governing hexagrams, combined with the four hexagrams of *Pin* and *Mou*, total sixty-four hexagrams in a month. Each hexagram has six lines, so sixty-four hexagrams yield three hundred eighty-four lines. Including intercalary months, the yearly count follows the Dipper’s revolution—hence it is said to align with the Celestial Pivot.

○ The Nameless Master says: The intercalary count begins with Qian’s first nine rising from Kun’s first six. Qian’s tally is thirty-six, and its six lines total two hundred sixteen. Kun’s first six rises from Qian’s first nine; Kun’s tally is twenty-four, and its six lines total one hundred forty-four. Combined, they make three hundred sixty, matching the degrees of the celestial sphere. The moon moves swiftly, completing a circuit in a month; the sun moves slowly, completing one in a year. The Celestial Pivot is the Dipper’s pivot, which revolves once in a day and night and shifts once a month—thus, in the first month, it aligns with *yin*; in the second, with *mao*. For example, in the first month, *jianyin* points to *gen* at the start of spring, and to *yin* at the *xu* hour of Rain Water. Hence the saying: *"Month by month it ever adds to xu, hour by hour it meets the Broken Army."* The sages of antiquity, knowing the waxing and waning of sun and moon and the ascent and descent of yin and yang, practiced the *zi-wu* talismanic fire. They said: *"Xu holds the day-and-night count of months; applying it in due season, it secretly accords with celestial degrees."* Thus it is called aligning with the Celestial Pivot. The supreme Dao, the wondrous mystery—its marvel lies here. Kan and Li rise and descend, giving birth to the numinous medicine, congealing the Yellow Sprout.

○ Yuan Gongfu says: *Zi* and *wu* are the ancestral sources of Kan and Li. Traversing the twelve positions and inverting the hexagrams’ lines, from dawn’s *Zhun* to dusk’s *Meng*, they form the essentials of the sixty hexagrams’ talismanic fire, each aligning with the pivot of heaven.

One need not dwell in deep mountains to guard solitary stillness—
The great hermit may abide even in the marketplace.

○ Ye Shibiao says: This speaks of those who have attained the method and those who have not. For those who have, even living amid the marketplace is possible.

○ Yuan Gongfu says: If one has grasped the method, cultivation is possible even without retreating to remote mountains and valleys.

Every person possesses the medicine of long life,
Yet fools, deluded, cast it heedlessly away.

○ Ye Shibiao says:

At the moment of birth, every person receives a single point of primordial yang qi, which is the root of life-sustenance. In men, from the age of sixteen (二八), true essence begins to discharge; in women, from the age of fourteen (二七), *tian gui* descends, and thereafter the desire between husband and wife arises. Yet the multitude of beings, lost in delusion, intoxicated by love and passion, leak and dissipate day and night, unaware of how much they lose. The root thus withers, and the line of death is drawn.

The world knows only that nurturing life requires abstaining from desire, yet fails to realize that with the stirring of a single thought, qi scatters with the heart, and essence perishes with qi. Those who pursue this Dao must embody the great void, making inner and outer as one—only then can the discourse on the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor begin.

When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite;
Where yellow sprouts arise, Kan and Li converge.

○ Ye Shibiao says: When heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends. The human body, embracing the harmonious qi, becomes equal to heaven and earth. If one can detach from form and abandon cunning, becoming serene and desireless, true qi will flow freely, ascending to the Celestial Valley like descending sweet dew. Kan and Li rise and fall, giving birth to numinous mercury, which coalesces into the yellow sprout.

○ Yuan Gongfu says: Heaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew; Kan and Li converge to produce the yellow sprout. The true person draws parallels from these four, encompassing Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li. *"The well-frog may claim no dragon’s lair exists; the hedge-gull may dispute the phoenix’s nest."* Those of shallow vision, like the well-frog, deny the existence of the vast ocean’s dragon palace; like the hedge-gull, they know not the boundless phoenix nest in Deng Forest.

○ Ye Shibiao says: This metaphor illustrates how petty and ignorant people, with their limited vision, disbelieve in the great elixir’s power to transform bones, reverse yang, and transcend the mundane to enter sagehood—delighting in a mere spoonful of water, dwelling in a patch of land, unaware of the dragon palace’s riches in the great sea or the phoenix’s vast nest in Deng Forest.

○ Yuan Gongfu says: The foolish and deluded of the world persist in their ways until death without repentance, like the well-frog unaware of the ocean or the hedge-gull ignorant of Deng Forest.

When the elixir ripens, gold naturally fills the house—
Why seek herbs or burn thatch in vain?

○ Ye Shibiao says: The great medicine of the golden elixir is the qi of heaven and earth’s natural emptiness, born from the formless. When the elixir matures, the body transforms into gold and jade, radiating divine light, majestic and resplendent. How can this compare to the worldly pursuit of herbs and minerals, merely altering copper and iron?

○ Yuan Gongfu says: Once the medicine is complete, golden light permeates the body—why bother seeking herbs or burning thatch to engage in false and deceptive practices?

To know the source where the medicine is produced,
Look only to the southwest as its native land.

○ Ye Shibiao says: This speaks of circulating the talisman to produce the medicine. The southwest is the earth of Kun, the native land of Great Yin. On the third day of the lunar month, the waning moon appears in the southwest, hence the elixir is born from Kun.

When lead meets *gui*, gather it swiftly;
When gold reaches its fullest, it is no longer fit to taste.

○ Ye Shibiao says: *Gui* is also Kun; Kun receives *gui*. This means the medicine is the qi of Great Yin, and one should gather it as soon as the moon begins to wax. After the fifteenth day, the moon wanes and qi declines, making it unsuitable for gathering. Great Yin is the qi of Great Yang. The moon itself has no light but shines by the sun’s reflection. One yang is Zhen (the moon’s first crescent); two yang is Dui (the first quarter); three yang is Qian (the full moon).

○ Yuan Gongfu says: From the moon’s first appearance as one yang (Zhen), to the fifteenth day as three yang (Qian), yang reaches its peak and yin begins to grow. Thus, after the fifteenth, the moon wanes and qi declines, corresponding to the three yin and the withering qi of autumn and winter—unsuitable for gathering. To gather after the tenth day is to isolate yin. The *Yi Zhuan* states: *"Solitary yin does not generate; solitary yang does not complete."*

○ Xiangchuan Weng says: *"When lead meets gui, gather it swiftly; when gold reaches its fullest, it is no longer fit to taste."* Lead and gold here refer to the golden elixir. One must act swiftly at the *gui* day’s *zi* hour, not delaying beyond the moment. Ye Wenshu mistakenly took *gui* as Kun; an alternate version reads *"gui day, zi hour,"* which is correct. For on the *gui* day, the cyclical sign *ren-zi* is obtained, where heavenly *ren* and earthly *gui* meet in the north. As Zhu Zhen’s *Yi Zhuan* states: *"At the dark of the moon’s dawn, Kan’s moon and Li’s sun meet at ren-gui."* Kan’s moon is *wu*; Li’s sun is *ji*. It also says: *"On the third day’s dusk, the moon appears in the east (Zhen); on the eighth day, it appears in the west (Dui); on the fifteenth day, it is full (Qian), appearing at jia-ren. On the sixteenth day’s dawn, it wanes (Xun), appearing at xin. On the twenty-third day, it wanes further (Gen), appearing at bing. On the thirtieth day, it is dark (Kun), appearing at yi, with gui concealed."* At the dark of the moon’s dawn, Kan’s water flows; at *wu* noon, Li’s fire aligns with *ji*.

○ Wumingzi says: *"When lead meets gui, gui* refers to the approach of the *chou* hour. *When gold reaches its fullest* means the moon is about to wane. The moon’s fullness depends on oral transmission; the subtlety of the *zi* hour lies in heart-to-heart transmission. The breath of the celestial cycle counts silently; the cold drips of the jade clepsydra mark the rhythm."* This is the secret essence passed down from mouth to mouth.

Send it back to the earthen crucible, sealing it tightly.
Ye Shibiao says: "This speaks of the medicine obtained in a single day. The earthen crucible is the Central Palace; sealing it ensures the true *xi* does not leak."
The *Cantong Qi* states: "When the three are interlocked, rest the body in an empty chamber, entrusting it to emptiness and non-thought as the constant. Let it return to the formless."

Yuan Gongfu says: "Those who refine the divine elixir must align with the celestial mechanism’s marvelous workings, emulate it without error in timing, avoid imbalance, and seal the Central Palace to prevent leakage. Only then can it pair with true mercury."
Next, introduce the flowing pearl to unite in harmony.
Ye Shibiao says: "This speaks of the following day, when the flowing pearl is again circulated into the tripod to merge with the medicine formed the previous day."
Wumingzi says: "After obtaining the millet pearl, ingest the elixir into the earthen crucible of the Cinnabar Field, securing the womb to prevent leakage. Circulate the fire to fly the pearl-like mercury and pair it—only then does the numinous embryo begin to form."

The medicine weighs one *jin*, requiring two eights;
adjust the fire’s timing to entrust it to yin and yang.
Ye Shibiao says: "This speaks of the fire in one tripod. A single tripod’s fire spans thirty days and three hundred sixty hours, corresponding to the *Yi*’s numbers. The *Yi* has sixty-four hexagrams totaling three hundred eighty-four lines. Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li represent the tripod and medicinal substances. If the days or hours are deficient, or the lines incomplete, the medicine will not form."
The *Cantong Qi* states: "The fire record is not made in vain; the *Yi* is expounded to clarify it. The crescent moon models the furnace; the White Tiger is the pivot of refinement. Mercury, the sun’s flowing pearl, accompanies the Azure Dragon. Raise the east to meet the west, and the hun and po naturally bind. The upper crescent’s number is eight; the lower crescent’s number is also eight. When the two crescents merge their essence, the Qian and Kun bodies are complete. Two eights correspond to one *jin*—the *Yi*’s Dao remains upright. Each *zhu* has three hundred eighty-four, matching the fire’s timing and the lines’ count."
Yuan Gongfu says: "The medicine requires two eights to form, the upper and lower crescents combining into one *jin*. Thus, the essence of the Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon transforms into true cinnabar. Without both yin and yang, the Dao cannot be achieved; without proper fire timing and refinement, the Great Elixir will never form."
The Perfected One urgently entrusted this warning.

Xiangchuan Weng says: "Eight ounces of crow’s liver, half a *jin* of hare’s marrow—combined, they make one *jin*, hence the need for two eights."
The *Dayi Zhi Tu* states: "In using fire, five days make one phase; one month has six phases; twelve months have seventy-two phases, completing a year’s work. One day has twelve hours; thirty days have three hundred sixty hours. Each day’s fire corresponds to a month’s use, modeling a year’s minor celestial cycle. Twelve months model twelve years, completing the great celestial cycle."

Do not refine the Three Yellows or Four Spirits;
seeking myriad medicines is not the true path.
Ye Shibiao says: "Before the primordial chaos divided, the Two Modes were already present—the Two Modes being the generative numbers of the Five Phases. Without form yet possessing nature, once the Great Ultimate separated, *jia* and *ji*’s *xi* transformed into true earth; *yi* and *geng*’s blackness into true metal; *bing* and *xin*’s nothingness into true water; *ding* and *ren*’s *xi* into true wood; *wu* and *gui*’s *qi* into true fire. These five scatter into the myriad things. The Great Elixir’s method—form arising from the formless—follows this principle. Those who pursue this Dao, knowing the primordial unity of the One *Qi*’s origin and embodying the natural numbers of emptiness, will find creation effortless—why seek myriad medicines?"
The *Cantong Qi* states: "It is near in my form, not apart from this body. Embrace the One and do not lose it—you may long endure. Pair it with ingestion; arrange the feminine and masculine. Discard the martial cinnabar of Wudu; cast away the eight stones."
Yin and yang of the same kind return to mutual resonance;
two eights correspond and naturally unite.
The *Cantong Qi* states: "Like kinds follow one another; discord cannot form treasure. Two eights—metal and wood—when joined become husband and wife, as in ‘metal fells wood to flourish.’"
Yuan Gongfu says: "Yin and yang of the same kind return to mutual resonance. Just as metal and wood’s two eights unite to form, the upper and lower crescents naturally unite—unexpected yet inevitable."

At the pool’s depths, the sun glows red and yin’s monstrosities vanish;
at the mountain’s peak, the moon shines white and the medicine’s sprouts renew.
People of this age must recognize true lead and mercury—
they are not common cinnabar or quicksilver.
Ye Shibiao says: "The medicine that returns to the Central Palace to congeal is yang; that which is produced externally is yin. Like the moon, which waxes and wanes due to the sun, the sun’s light remains fundamentally unmoved."
Yuan Gongfu says: "‘At the pool’s depths, the sun glows red and yin’s monstrosities vanish’ means that when Supreme Yin reaches the Kun position, uniting again with Supreme Yang, the mountain’s peak reveals the Yellow Sprout. This is true lead and true mercury—not comparable to common cinnabar or quicksilver."

Do not take solitary yin for yang;
cultivating a single thing only leads to emaciation.
Ye Shibiao says: "This speaks of those who cling to stubborn emptiness, ignorant of creation’s workings. Many sit in desiccation, their qi and blood withering, becoming increasingly frail."
Master Zhongli says: "Sitting motionless for years, thinking oneself near the immortals’ fate—yet without understanding the dragon’s roar or tiger’s howl, it is mere desiccation, futile."
He also says: "The intermingling of being and non-being is the elixir’s root; the correspondence of concealment and revelation is water and metal. Do not claim this body is entirely the Dao—cultivating a single thing is solitary yin."
Xiangchuan Weng says: "The yin essence in the field is one’s true essence. Essence generates qi; qi generates spirit. Nothing nourishes the body more than these."
Thus, the ancients warned: "When the oil is exhausted, the lamp goes out; when the marrow is depleted, the person perishes."

This speaks of essence and qi as the very root of the body.

Yet this substance belongs to yin—its nature is not firm, its temperament prone to flight. If not restrained and refined, it cannot be coagulated to undergo transformation. Without the primal yang of the Undifferentiated Unity to govern it, there is no way for it to congeal and achieve transmutation.

Master Zhongli says:
Tears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, and blood—
these seven things are all yin.
If one takes these as the substance of the elixir,
how can the spirit ascend to offer cinnabar and gold?
Exerting the body through pressing and guiding is not the Dao;
refining qi and consuming auroral mist is mere delusion.
Though one may spend a lifetime seeking the subjugation of lead and mercury,
when will one ever witness the descent of tiger and dragon?

*The Great Yi’s Aspiration Diagram* says: In cultivating the golden elixir, what is meant by "punishment and execution" is mutual restraint. Without restraint, spirit and qi do not intermingle.

Thus Li Quan states: Among the hundreds of methods guarding the golden elixir, the essential lies in the divine water of the Flowery Pond. This is the Dao of one yin governing one yang—the meaning of the Flowery Pond.

*The Kinship of the Three* says:
White is the essence of metal—this is yang-one;
black is the foundation of water—this is yin-one.
Water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named one—thus it is three.
One is the golden elixir.

The Nameless Master says:
Simply capture the White Tiger to seize the Dragon,
and naturally the Azure Dragon will restrain the Tiger.
The two breaths devour one another, giving birth to the golden elixir.
Having attained this elixir, apply it thus:
Once the true Dragon and true Tiger within are subdued,
the dragons and tigers beyond the world will submit of themselves.
Once the inner refining of spirit, soul, ghost, and vitality is perfected,
the ghosts and spirits beyond the world will revere you.
Without the flourishing of the Dao and the aid of virtue, who could achieve this?

I urge you to exhaustively seek the place of your birth—
returning to the root and restoring the origin is the King of Medicines.

Ye Shibiao says: At the beginning of human life, within the womb, one follows the mother’s breath, receiving qi to take form. Upon birth, the umbilical cord is cut, and a single point of primal numinous qi gathers below the navel. Day by day, the spirit departs and qi scatters, drifting from its source to pursue external affairs, unaware of the Dao of returning to the root and restoring the origin. The sages point to the root of nature and life, teaching people to gather spirit and collect qi, to return the coming and going, to revert to the root and restore the mandate.

Yuan Gongfu says: The world mistakenly takes the parents’ essence and blood as the original face, the place of birth—this is not so. One must know that humans are born from the prenatal qi, and one must recognize the mother of the mother, the ancestor of true lead.

Consider rice: when it meets the sixth month and blooms at noon, within its flower lies an essence like a drop of water—this is wu-ji. Upon encountering the true yang’s breath, it immediately forms grain, ripening in a hundred days. Thus, people’s insatiable daily consumption arises because agriculture produces sweetness, the *Hong Fan* ascribes to earth, which can nourish the entire body. Neither sour nor pungent, neither bitter nor salty, its flavor is sweet and mild—augmented by daily tea and the breath of dawn.

Once gathered, it scatters. Thus, men from sixteen onward leak true essence, and women from fourteen onward descend with heavenly water. Thereafter arises the desire between husband and wife. With a single union, conception occurs. The child in the womb follows the mother’s breath, receiving qi to complete the ten-month cycle. When the fetus is complete and qi is full, the numinous light enters the body, and it emerges from the womb. Upon cutting the umbilical cord, a single point of primal numinous qi gathers below the navel. Day by day, the spirit departs and qi shifts, depleting the true source, drifting from the root—ultimately leading to death and decay.

The Perfected One, pitying those who drift in the currents of life and death, drowning in the river of love, composed songs and poems to directly point to the root of nature and life, exhorting the world. His intent was this: Initially, from the two qi of father and mother, formless matter took form. Having grown and been nurtured, what has become of it? Now that you understand the place of your birth, how can you not seek it?

Xiangchuan Weng says: The true Dragon and true Tiger are the two eights. True lead and true mercury are the qi of the two crescents. Yet many learners take side paths and heterodox substances as lead and mercury. Thus, the Immortal Elder directly points to the place of their production, returning to this root, restoring this origin—this is the King of Medicines.

**Ten**
Diligently seek true lead with all your intent,
lest time slip by in vain.
Ye Shibiao says: Lead is the true breath of the north, the first yang newly born—it is the mother of medicine.

The Most High says: Take lead as the lord, mercury as the minister. If the lead is not true, mercury will not draw near. Thus, lead is the master of creation.

Simply capture the Earthly Corpse to seize Vermilion Mercury,
and naturally the Heavenly Soul will restrain Water-Metal.

Yuan Gongfu says: To obtain true lead, capture the Earthly Corpse to seize Vermilion Mercury—this is yin seeking yang. Then you will see the Heavenly Soul restrain Water-Metal—this is yang seeking yin. Truly, when the Dao is lofty, dragons and tigers submit; when virtue is weighty, ghosts and spirits revere.

Having known eternal life equal to heaven and earth,
worries will no longer arise in the heart.

Ye Shibiao says: Dragon and Tiger are lead and mercury. Ghosts and spirits are the soul and vitality.

**Eleven**
Yellow Sprout and White Snow are not hard to find—
the discerning must rely on deep virtue and conduct.
The Four Images and Five Phases all depend on earth;
the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams how could they leave ren?

Ye Shibiao says: The Four Images are the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior. The Five Phases are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. They are transformed through one kan and li, wu and ji. The Three Origins are the stems, branches, and musical notes. The Eight Trigrams are qian, kun, kan, li, gen, zhen, xun, and dui—none depart from the primordial chaos.

Ren means pregnancy. Heavenly ren and earthly gui meet in the north, thus all things conceive in the zi hour.

Yuan Gongfu says: The Four Images are Dragon, Tiger, Bird, and Warrior. The Five Phases are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Without true earth of wu-ji, they cannot be drilled and clustered to form the foundation of the elixir.

The Three Origins are Heaven, Earth, and Humanity; the Eight Trigrams are qian, kun, kan, li, gen, zhen, xun, and dui. All emerge from the water-number one, thus none depart from the midst of primordial chaos. Ren means pregnancy: heavenly ren and earthly gui meet in the north, and all things conceive in the zi hour. Therefore, the Golden Elixir also arises from within primordial chaos.

Master Wumingzi says: Ren is water, the true One’s water—this is the realm of the true One’s essence, the mother of Heaven and Earth, the root of yin and yang, the origin of water and fire, the ancestor of sun and moon, and the progenitor of the ten thousand things. Refined into a numinous substance, none can recognize it; when yin demons are dissolved, no ghosts may invade. Should one seek to ask others for the secret formula, not a single soul would prove a true confidant.

Ye Shibiao says: This is no matter for casual discussion.

Twelve
Even in grasses and trees, yin and yang stand paired as one;
if either is lacking, no fragrance will bloom.
First unfurl green leaves, yang takes the lead;
next blossom red flowers, yin follows behind.

Ye Shibiao says: All things bear yin yet embrace yang—neither may be absent. Yang precedes, yin follows, just as lead gives rise to mercury.

Yuan Gongfu says: All things bear yin yet embrace yang, and even grasses and trees are no exception—neither may be absent. The first unfolding of green leaves is yang taking the lead; the subsequent blooming of red flowers is yang, yet yin follows behind. The common Dao lies solely in daily practice, but who knows the turning and returning of the true source? I say to all gentlemen who study the Dao: if you do not comprehend yin and yang, do not rashly mock.

Yuan Gongfu says: The constancy of the Dao resides in daily use, yet who understands the principle of the true source’s turning and returning? The Perfected One states that those who study the Dao, failing to recognize the mutual transformation of yin and yang, merely scoff in vain.

Thirteen
If you do not recognize the inversion within the mysterious,
how can you know the lotus cultivated in fire?

*The Cantong Qi* states: When gold enters fierce fire, its color does not lose its luster. The sun receives the moon’s transformation, yet their bodies do not harm each other. This speaks of cultivating the lotus in fire—yin returning to the yang chamber.

Master Wuming says: The sun’s *li* belongs to yang yet is the female; the moon’s *kan* belongs to yin yet is the male. This is inversion. These two things are born through inversion, yet with this elixir one refines one’s own mercury to conceive the sacred embryo—this is called "the man becomes pregnant," just as cultivating the lotus in fire. Thus, the Immortal Elder says in *Reading the Cantong Qi*: "The Five Phases reverse, and the elixir’s body remains ever numinous and enduring." Water reverses into earth, earth into wood, wood into metal, metal into fire, fire into water—this is the meaning of inversion.

"Drawing the White Tiger home to nurture,
it gives birth to a luminous pearl like the full moon."

Ye Shibiao says: The White Tiger is the essence of metal. When drawn into the crucible and furnace, warmed and nurtured into the elixir, yin transforms into pure yang. Master Wuming says: The method of refining the elixir first takes the half-moon on the western side at the waxing crescent, obtaining eight ounces of yang metal. Then it takes the half-moon on the eastern side at the waning crescent, combining their qi to generate the elixir. Thus, one obtains a single grain of golden elixir like the full moon. Two eights make a catty—this is the Immortal Elder’s meaning in speaking of the full moon, an analogy for the outer elixir’s symbolic form.

When this elixir is swallowed into one’s belly, the golden elixir becomes the White Tiger. Again, one draws this White Tiger into one’s belly to nurture and pair it with the *wu-ji* earth. Then, circulating the yin tally and yang fire through the sixty-four hexagrams, one refines it into a single grain of golden liquid return-elixir, also weighing one catty and resembling the full moon. This is an analogy for the inner medicine’s symbolic form.

The reason the inner medicine resembles the full moon is that the hexagrams used to circulate fire each have six lines, and sixty-four hexagrams total three hundred eighty-four lines, symbolizing one catty weighing three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. Thus, Master Zhenyi says: "The two crescents’ weight of one catty divides into three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, corresponding to the fire phases and the count of lines."

The Immortal Elder’s reference to the ancestral full moon merely aims for students to together illuminate the intent of creation and destiny, distinguishing the inner and outer eights’ numbers—they cannot be discussed in the same way.

"Guard the medicine furnace and watch the fire phases,"
Ye Shibiao says: People who forge metals and stones for three to nine years, hoping to transmute them, merely guard in vain.
"Yet observe the spirit-breath, letting nature take its course."
Ye Shibiao says: Heaven and earth have their natural harmony; harmony has its natural numbers. Humans, born of heaven and earth, share qi and numbers equal to them. Those who cultivate the truth exhaust the origin of creation and destiny, knowing the paths of ascent and descent. Simply settle the spirit and stabilize the breath, not generating a single thought, utterly desireless—then the spirit-qi circulates freely, and creation unfolds naturally. Laozi says: "Subtle and continuous, its use is never exhausted."

When the host of yin is entirely stripped away, the elixir ripens. Leaping from the mortal cage, one attains longevity of ten thousand years.
Ye Shibiao says: The true unity of qi is the encasement of yang. People who eat the five grains become obstructed, unable to circulate creation and destiny, so their entire bodies belong to yin. Sages forget form to nurture qi, forget qi to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture emptiness. Thus, *kan* and *li* wax and wane within the body, wind and clouds issue from the seven orifices, true qi flows freely, generating the elixir medicine. Exchanging bones and returning to yang, one endures as long as heaven and earth.

Fourteen
"Three, five, and one—just these three characters,
truly understood from ancient times to now, are rare indeed."

Ye Shibiao says: "Three and five make fifteen; the one means that three and five return to a single place."

Master Yuan the Auxiliary says: "Three is wood, representing the *li* maiden and cinnabar mercury. One is water, representing the *kan* man and white metal. Five is earth, representing the central palace of *wu* and *ji*. The *Book of Changes* states: 'Three, five, and one—these are the essence of heaven and earth.' The *Cantong Qi* says: 'Originally there were but two things, yet in the end they become three and five; when three and five unite as one, they all gather in response to the two.' Guan Ziming’s *Commentary on the Book of Changes* says: 'Yin and yang, three and five—yang is three, yin is two, combining to make five. All arise from the primordial unity of *qi*. East is three, south is two, together making five; north is one, west is four, sharing the same. *Wu* and *ji* reside in the generative number five. When the three families meet, the infant is formed.'

Ye Shibiao says: "Wood’s number is three, fire’s is two—this is the first five. Metal’s number is four, water’s is one—this is the second five. Earth’s number is five—this is the third five. When three and five return to one, they congeal to form the elixir. The infant is spoken of as pure yang."

The Nameless Master says: "The dragon pertains to wood, whose number is three, dwelling in the east. Wood generates fire, so the dragon’s arcane *qi* pertains to fire. Fire’s number is two, dwelling in the south. These two things share the same origin, so three and two combine to form the first five. The tiger pertains to metal, whose number is four, dwelling in the west. Metal generates water, so the tiger’s arcane *qi* pertains to water. Water’s number is one, dwelling in the north. These two things share the same office, so four and one combine to form the second five. The two fives intersect at the central palace of *wu* and *ji*, which pertains to earth, whose number is five—thus forming the third five. When the three fives unite, they form the elixir. The elixir is the one. When these three congeal to form the infant, it is truly rare. The infant is the one containing true *qi*; when the ten-month gestation is complete, one enters the foundation of sagehood."

Ye Shibiao says: "When the five phases gather in this place to form the elixir, it is like a child in the womb—when the count is full, the form is complete. Transcending the subtle to enter sagehood, this is the foundation."

Fifteen
Not knowing the true lead and its original lineage,
all efforts are vainly expended.
Severing ties with one’s wife only divides yin and yang,
fasting merely leaves the stomach and intestines empty.

Ye Shibiao says: "Severing ties with one’s wife and fasting are the proper duties of one who studies the Dao. The true person’s intent is to warn that if one does not recognize the true lead, merely severing ties and fasting are taken as exhausting the Dao—hence the sayings about dividing yin and yang and emptying the stomach and intestines. If one has a wife, there is no need to sever ties; if one is indifferent and without desire, it is the same as having no wife. If one eats, there is no need to fast; if true *qi* is full, one naturally does not think of food and drink. Nowadays, people act recklessly and lose their foundation, merely digesting and transforming—how can the one *qi* be generated and completed? Some speak of dual cultivation for husband and wife, like Liu An the King, Xu Jingsun, Zhang Tongkong, and Liu Gang. Little do they know that these individuals heard the Dao after already having wives—just as the fool says, there is no need to sever ties. If one truly remains with a wife, how could the true person have naturally possessed a crucible to refine dragon and tiger, or uttered lines about shouldering a family and cherishing children and wife?"

Master Yuan the Auxiliary says: "Before heaven and earth divided, their form was like a chicken’s egg, containing the primordial unity of true *qi*—this is the lead of *qi*. Thus, true lead is the ancestor of heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things. After heaven and earth divided, the number one generated water, two generated fire, three generated wood, and four generated black lead. The Dao of the golden elixir begins with the water mother as the foundation of the elixir—this is the mercury mother. The water mother in turn generates true quicksilver, hence it is called returning to the one and reverting to the source."

The True Unity Master says: "Metal inherently generates water, so it is called the mother of water. It constantly conceals its form in water, like a child hidden in the womb. Water is the child of metal. After black lead transforms in quality, it lodges in the west as the white tiger of metal. The fetal water again conceals the mother’s womb, becoming quicksilver—true mercury."

The *Cantong Qi* says: "When metal comes to return to its nature, it is then called the reverted elixir." Thus, the true lead is the ancestor of mercury. If one can recognize the purport of the true lead and cultivate accordingly, one’s years will equal those of heaven and earth. Other practices—severing ties with one’s wife, fasting, swallowing and absorbing, contemplation and visualization—are all methods of effort, distinct from the Dao of the elixir.

Grasses, trees, metals, and silver are all impure substances;
clouds, mist, sun, and moon belong to the realm of obscurity.

Ye Shibiao says: "Grasses, trees, metals, and silver are all material things; clouds, mist, sun, and moon are external *qi*. How could they reverse yang and refine the elixir, selecting pearls and rubies to make the great return? Those who claim that external elixirs transform internal medicine do not realize that metals and minerals are unrelated. It also says: 'The sun’s essence and moon’s spirit are the essence of heaven and earth. Even if obtained by proper methods, they are still not true. Because they are not one’s own things, they require you to guard them with bitter toil. Moreover, swallowing and absorbing, contemplation and visualization—all differ from the work of the golden elixir.'"

Sixteen
Though ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures speak in unison,
the golden elixir alone is the root and origin.
Rely on the *kun* position to give birth to the formed body,
plant it in the *qian* household’s palace of mutual arousal.

Ye Shibiao says: "The moon emerges from the southwest *kun* position, meaning the medicine follows the great yin in its generation. The true person says the moon is the elixir medicine. *Qian* is yang. Planting it in the *qian* household means casting mercury into lead, yin returning to the yang chamber."

Master Yuan the Auxiliary says: "The southwest *kun* position is the direction where the great yin is generated. The great yin completes one circuit of the heavens each month, the great yang one circuit each year. Every time, at midnight before the new moon, at the initial movement of the yang fire, the sun and moon unite as jade discs above the *Bi* and *Xu* constellations. Thus, in the twelve stations of the year, they conjoin to give birth to the ten thousand things."

A year comprises twelve months, divided into greater and lesser periods, for they follow the numbers of odd and even—odd being yang, even being yin. This also reflects the principle of waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness. Both sun and moon traverse the ecliptic, ascending and descending, floating and sinking. The sun is transformed by the moon, yet its body remains unharmed.

By the third day, the moon receives the sun’s *hun*-soul, and its slender crescent is born. As the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* states: "Through divine transformation, *Zhen* is formed. On the third day, the moon emerges from *geng*." Here, *Qian* unites with the lower line of *Kun* to become the *Zhen* hexagram, and so on the third day it appears in the *geng* direction. This is what the *Book of Changes* calls the time of "gaining companions in the southwest."

*Mao* and *you* are the directions of the sun and moon’s rising and setting, the true positions of Metal and Wood. From the sixth to the eighth day, the first quarter is formed. The *Dragon-Tiger Classic* says: "Kun transforms again to become *Dui*. On the eighth day, the moon emerges from *ding*." Thus, the upper quarter of Metal weighs half a *jin*. *Qian* unites with the middle line of *Kun* to become the *Dui* hexagram, and the moonlight reaches half its arc, straight as a cord. The moon appears in the *ding* direction, symbolizing the cauldron in which Metal and Fire are evenly balanced.

From the eleventh to the fifteenth day, the three yang lines are complete, and the full moon shines upon the *jia* position in the east—this is called the "moon’s fullness," when the moon’s *po*-soul fully receives the sun’s *hun*-soul and becomes whole. At the time when Metal and Water are at their peak, the body of *Qian*’s vigor reaches its height. The essence of the great yang fills the inner chamber of the spirit, and Metal and Fire’s black transformation becomes mercury. Mercury and its mother linger together, altering the body of Metal. The toad and hare’s souls intertwine, their radiance illuminating the cauldron as the Metal’s *qi* gradually flourishes and transforms into the elixir.

Yang reaches its extreme, and yin is about to arise. The *Dragon-Tiger Classic* says: "On the sixteenth, the turning cry begins, and *Qian*’s initial line wanes to form *Xun*." Here, *Kun* unites with the lower line of *Qian* to become the *Xun* hexagram. The yang fire first retreats, and the yin tally begins to grow. At dawn, it appears in the *xin* direction, just as when the yang fire first advances—like the moon’s appearance on the third day.

It further states: "*Qian* diminishes again to form *Gen*. On the twenty-third, the lower quarter." Thus, the lower quarter of Water weighs half a *jin*. From the twenty-first day, the yin tally retreats again, and by the twenty-third day, *Kun* unites with the middle line of *Qian* to become the *Gen* hexagram. The moon appears in the *bing* direction, its meaning the same as the upper quarter—within the cauldron, Metal and Water are evenly balanced. The two quarters combined total one *jin*. As the *Triple Concordance* says: "When the two quarters unite their essence, the bodies of *Qian* and *Kun* are complete."

From the twenty-sixth to the twenty-eighth day, *Kun* unites with the upper line of *Qian* to become the *Kun* hexagram. The moonlight nearly fades, and the moon appears in the *yi* direction, extending toward the northeast—this is what the *Book of Changes* calls the time of "losing companions in the northeast." From the twenty-eighth to the thirtieth day, the yin tally dissipates entirely, and the *qi* of yin and yang each come to rest. Earth harmonizes with Wood and Metal to become liquid. The great yang’s brilliance no longer aligns with the moon, and the body of the great yin turns wholly dark.

From here, the cycle begins anew without end. The moon is pure yin—without the influence of the sun’s pure yang, how could it vanish and then be reborn? Humans, too, are pure yin. To return to the root and restore life, to attain longevity and enduring vision, one must follow the body of *Kun* and plant in the palace of *Qian*, casting mercury into lead so that yin returns to the yang chamber. Is this not the fundamental principle of the Golden Elixir?

The Nameless Master says: "The most fitting path returns to unity. There is none who does not take the *qi* of the Dragon and Tiger’s initial crescent as the substance of the elixir. Simply follow the principle of *Kun*-Mother’s generation, reverse the process to cultivate it, and after obtaining the elixir, plant it in the palace of *Qian*-Father’s mutual arousal to circulate the tally and fire. The essential wonder of cultivating the truth lies in nothing beyond the two words: lead and fire."

How profound! Master Pingshu has revealed the celestial mechanism in full. No wonder the celestial secrets have all been disclosed—it is because scholars remain utterly confused. If one comprehends the meaning within these verses, one will immediately behold the Three Pure Ones, the Most High Lords.

*Cultivating the Truth: Ten Books, Awakening to Reality*, Scroll Twenty-Seven begins.

**Sixty-Four Quatrains (Part One)**

First take Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel,
Then transmit the Raven and Hare’s medicine for refinement.

**Master Zhenyi says:**
Before the Great Simplicity and Primal Chaos, the numinous and most subtle lay hidden without sign. At the juncture of the Great Ultimate and the Supreme One, there existed a thing undifferentiated, wherein the essence of the Central True One became the ancestor of Heaven and Earth, the origin of the myriad things.
Once qi took form, the Two Modes divided.
Thereafter arose Qian and Kun, yin and yang, the Five Phases, the Three Powers, and the names of the ten thousand things. Thus, Qian and Kun were established as the warp and woof of Heaven and Earth, while yin and yang were set in motion as the key to qi’s transformation.
The Golden Elixir shares the same path as creation, so Qian and Kun serve as the crucible and vessel, mirroring the Great Foundry; Kan and Li become the medicinal substances, paralleling the power of transformation. The remaining sixty hexagrams are arrayed as the firing times.

**The *Cantong Qi* states:**
Qian and Kun are the gate and door of the Changes, the parents of all hexagrams. Kan and Li form the outer walls, the axle and hub, with the four trigrams of the furnace and bellows as the key. They encompass the Dao of yin and yang, just as a charioteer holds the reins, follows the plumb line, and steers by the wheel tracks, governing the external from the center. Thus, in the celestial reckoning, the lunar phases number five and six, while the warp and weft attend the sun, combining to form the sixty-four hexagrams, with hardness and softness as their outer and inner aspects.

**The *Secret Diagram of the Cantong Qi* states:**
Li receives *ji* as the sun, fire, the heart, cinnabar, the dragon, and mercury. Kan receives *wu* as the moon, water, the kidneys, lead, the tiger, and qi. The Li hexagram is yang within and yin without, hard externally and soft internally—its radiant sun is yang, its dark raven is yin, signifying yang containing yin. The Kan hexagram is yin without and yang within, soft externally and hard internally—its lunar soul is yin, its hare spirit is yang, signifying yin containing yang.
Yet the *Commentary on the Northern Dipper Sutra* also says: The raven has three feet, a yang number; the hare has four feet, a yin number. Three is the generative number of wood, four the generative number of metal, thus corresponding to Wood Duke and Metal Mother. The dragon and mercury belong to wood, the tiger and lead to metal—wood emerges from fire, metal arises from water.
Once these two substances are driven into the Yellow Path,
How could the Golden Elixir fail to take form?

**Ye Shibiao says:**
The "two substances" refer to the medicine produced by the aforementioned Kan and Li, the Central Palace of the Yellow Path. Once these two attain the Central Palace and receive the nurturing of the firing times, the elixir will invariably form.

**II**
Establish the furnace and erect the crucible according to Qian and Kun,
Refine the essence and spirit to govern the hun and po.

**Ye Shibiao says:**
Before the division of primordial chaos, Qian and Kun occupied the positions of one and six above and below, while Kan and Li held the fifteenth positions between them. After the Great Ultimate divided, the pattern remained the same. Thus, the Dao of the elixir models the creation of Heaven and Earth, using Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel to refine the sun and moon.
Gathering and dispersing, steaming and blending to transform—
How dare one treat such mysteries as common discourse?

**Ye Shibiao says:**
The true qi must be steamed, ascending and descending, now gathering, now scattering, beyond all description.

**III**
Do not waste effort on the elixir tortoise,
To refine the medicine, seek the Reclining Moon Furnace.
It possesses a natural true fire,
No need for kindling or bellows.

**Ye Shibiao says:**
The two kidneys resemble a reclining moon, with the primordial elixir within. The crucible is the root of creation, containing the natural true yang fire that generates the elixir medicine.

**The Nameless Master says:**
Ye Wenshu’s identification of the two kidneys as the Reclining Moon is mistaken. The mouth of this furnace reclines upward, open like a crescent moon—this is the Sea of Yin. Within it lies a natural true fire, requiring no labor of kindling or bellows.

**Yuan Gongfu says:**
Relying on external elixirs to burn gold and refine silver wastes resources, and even after months of accumulation, success is never achieved. The method of the Golden Elixir must use the Reclining Moon as the furnace, employing the natural true fire for refinement—only then can it be accomplished.

**The *Cantong Qi* states:**
The Reclining Moon models the crucible and vessel,
With the White Tiger as the pivot of refinement.
The human Central Palace takes the image of the moon’s essence. If one can grasp the realm of true yang within, then internally it will be like the moon generating its essence, gradually transforming into the body of Qian’s yang, producing the elixir medicine.

**IV**
In the Reclining Moon Furnace, the jade medicine is born;
Within the cinnabar crucible, the mercury levels.
Only after the fire’s power harmonizes
Is the yellow sprout planted and gradually grown.

**Ye Shibiao says:**
The "jade medicine" is the medicine in its initial stage. The "cinnabar crucible" refers to mercury emerging from within it; when nurtured by fire, it congeals into substance.

**Yuan Gong adds:**
The "jade medicine" first arises from the sun’s mercury, gentle and harmonious. Through the regulation of the firing times, the yellow sprout is gradually nurtured. The external medicine resembles the internal medicine—truly profound!

**The Nameless Master says:**
The Reclining Moon Furnace is a yin furnace, containing the yang warmth of the jade medicine—this is the tiger’s latent qi. The cinnabar crucible is a yang vessel, holding the yin qi of mercury—this is the dragon’s latent qi. The Golden Elixir arises from the harmonious blending of these two fires. Once the true qi of the Supreme One is planted in the Yellow House, it gradually sprouts and forms millet grains.

**V**
Swallowing saliva and absorbing qi are human practices,
Only with medicine can creation be generated.
If the crucible lacks the true seed,
It is like boiling water and fire in an empty cauldron.

**Ye Shibiao says:**
The "true seed" is the Metal Mother of the Central Palace. Only with the mother can there be abundant generation; true mercury transforms into the elixir.

**The *Cantong Qi* states:**
Plant grain with millet,
Hatch chicks with eggs.
Branches, stems, flowers, and leaves—
The fruit hangs in abundance.
Hold fast to the root and trunk,
Lest the original substance be lost.

**VI**
To harmonize lead and mercury and form the elixir,
Neither great nor small harms the two realms’ wholeness.
**Ye Shibiao says:**
Yang mercury and yin lead—yang is noble, yin is humble,
Hence the analogy of the two realms, great and small.
The sage fears that those who cultivate the elixir may err
Through excess or deficiency, or stray into partial yin or yang,
Thus he speaks of this.
If you ask what true lead is,
The toad’s glow shines all day upon the Western River.
**The Perfected One says:**
The West is the direction of Metal;
The moon is the function of the medicine.
**Master Daoguang says:**
The toad’s glow shines all day on the darkened thoroughfare,
The moon’s leak reveals countless yellow sprouts.

**VII**
Before refining the Returned Elixir, do not enter the mountains,
For within and without the mountains, lead is not to be found.
This supreme treasure exists in every household,
Yet fools, lacking full discernment, fail to recognize it.
**Ye Shibiao says:**
Lead is a substance within the body,
Not to be sought in mountain forests.
Only when you know this should you enter the mountains to practice.
**The *Cantong Qi* states:**
Abandon attachments and cast off harm,
Take refuge in the hills and mounds.
Roam the vast expanse,
Neighboring the spirits.
**Wang Dao says:**
For refining the Golden Liquor’s divine elixir,
First, you must recognize the medicine’s root and source,
Then verify the fire’s advance and retreat.
Yang ascends, yin descends—
Never straying from the midnight and noon directions;
The sun departs, the moon arrives—
Ever bound to the positions of dawn and dusk.

To employ Kan and Li is to move water and fire,
Making dragon and tiger transform into husband and wife.
Returning the essence of the corpse to the Moon Grotto,
Then lead yields cinnabar within;
Playing with the Vermilion Bird in the Li Palace,
Then cinnabar gives birth to mercury.
Emotion and nature embrace,
Husband and wife nurture each other,
Naturally forming the Golden Liquor.

Thus, human emotion and nature do not depart from the body,
And the cinnabar and mercury of the elixir both arise within lead.
Emotion and nature in man are not external things,
Just as cinnabar and mercury in lead are not mixed kinds.
Therefore, the Great Elixir’s Dao lies entirely in the two qi of yin and yang,
Which depend on each other to form the supreme medicine.

The *Dānshā Jué* states:
Those who refine the spirit unite with the supreme Dao,
Knowing that the Golden Elixir is not made from gold, silver, earth, stone, plants, ashes, or frost.

As bamboo must be mended with bamboo,
So must a chick be brooded by its own kind.
All other mismatched efforts are in vain—
How can they compare to true lead uniting with the sacred mechanism?

**Ye Shibiao says:**
External medicines are like another’s wealth or a different surname—alien.
Only one’s own true lead, with qi of the same kind, will harmonize.

**The *Cantong Qi* states:**
If you wish to make an elixir for consumption,
Use only those of the same kind.
Like kinds follow one another,
While mismatched affairs fail to produce treasure.

**Yuan Gongfu says:**
Bamboo cannot be mended except with bamboo;
A chicken cannot be hatched except at dawn.
When a person’s qi and blood decline and the cauldron and furnace decay,
Only the true qi of Heaven and Earth can restore them.

---

Do not use common lead—use true lead,
And when true lead is spent, discard it.
This is the true and wondrous secret of using lead:
To use lead is not to use it—these are truthful words.

An ancient song says:
Lead is the mother of the sprout,
The sprout is the child of lead.
Once the golden flower is obtained,
Lead is no longer employed.
For lead is the Golden Mother of the Central Palace,
Who gives birth to true mercury;
When mercury congeals into the elixir,
Lead is then set aside—
Like the seed of the myriad things.

**Wumingzi says:**
True lead is the qi of the True One.
As a person’s original yang qi scatters daily,
It cannot congeal to form the sacred embryo.
Thus, the sage refines true lead to restrain it,
Causing it to congeal into cinnabar.
Day by day, fire is applied,
Gradually adding mercury.
As mercury increases, lead’s qi gradually disperses—
Hence, lead is withdrawn and mercury is added.
After ten months of work, lead is exhausted and mercury is dried,
Transforming into the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir,
And the form becomes purely yang.
Thus it is said:
When true lead is spent, it is discarded.
The saying “use lead, do not use it”—how could it be empty words?

---

To empty the heart and fill the abdomen—both meanings are profound,
Yet emptying the heart is only to recognize the heart.
Better to first fill the abdomen by refining lead,
And thus guard the gold that fills the hall.

**Ye Shibiao says:**
Empty the heart, fill the abdomen—
Empty the heart to nurture the mysterious,
Fill the abdomen to nurture the elixir.

**Yuan Gongfu says:**
To refine mercury, first refine lead;
To refine lead, first fill the abdomen,
Then mercury will arise naturally.

**Laozi says:**
Emptiness and fullness communicate—
This is called the Great Harmony.
People often fill the heart and empty the abdomen,
Going against this principle,
Which leads to death and decay.

**Wumingzi says:**
An empty heart means no self,
All things are void and clear—
This is the state of Heaven.
A full abdomen means refining lead to dry mercury,
Preventing the essence from scattering.
Essence is mercury;
Guard mercury to fill the abdomen,
And gold and jade will fill the hall.
The One is the elixir—
Embrace the One to empty the heart,
And when the heart is empty, dust does not settle.
Then, in its fullness,
Refine lead to restrain it,
Drying mercury and transforming the form.
Thus, embrace the One to empty the heart,
And when the heart is empty, the spirit is wondrous,
Uniting with the Dao in truth.
Those who practice the elixir but have not refined lead and gold,
Do not scatter your essence—
If essence is lacking, the Returned Elixir will not form.

---

In a dream, I visited Xihua and ascended to the Nine Heavens,
Where an immortal bestowed upon me the *Zhixuan Pian*.
Its words are simple and few,
Teaching only the refinement of mercury and lead.

**Yuan Gongfu says:**
This passage echoes the meaning of Gao Xiangxian’s song—
No further annotation is needed.

---

The Dao arises from emptiness and nothingness, giving birth to the One Qi,
Which then produces yin and yang.
Yin and yang unite to form the Three Bodies,
And the Three Bodies give rise to the flourishing of the myriad things.

**Ye Shibiao says:**
Emptiness gives birth to the One Qi,
The One Qi gives birth to yin and yang,
Yin and yang interact to produce the myriad things,
And the myriad things generate endlessly.
Within the primordial spirit chamber of a person,
A single speck of true essence is the mother.
The ascending and descending qi,
When they interact, give birth to the medicine—
Thus the medicine generates itself.

**Yuan Gongfu says:**
True lead resides before the dim and obscure primordial chaos,
First giving birth to the One Qi.
The One gives birth to the Two Modes,
The Two Modes give birth to the Three Powers,
The Three Powers give birth to the myriad things,
And the myriad things generate endlessly.

The Kan thunder roars, refining the Golden Water formula,
Fire erupts from Kunlun, uniting yin and yang.
When these two things harmonize,
The elixir naturally ripens, and fragrance permeates the body.

**Ye Shibiao says:**
The Golden Water formula is the Central Palace.
Fire erupts from Kunlun—
This is the burning mountain talisman.
When yin and yang unite,
They produce the elixir,
Whose flavor is fragrant and sweet.

**Yuan Gongfu says:**
The Kan thunder roars—this is the yang within yin;
Fire erupts from Kunlun—this is the yin within yang.
When these two things gather and unite in the Golden Water position of the Central Palace,
After the medicine ripens,
Fragrance naturally permeates the bones and flesh.

**Gao Xiangxian says:**
The Crimson Palace steams into the reddened skin—
How could it be merely fragrance permeating the body?

**Wumingzi says:**
The Kan thunder is the fire within water—
This is the yin fire, the bowstring qi of the tiger.
The Golden Water formula is the northwest Qian direction—
This is the dragon,
And the northwest is also the Gate of Heaven,
Called the Mysterious Gate.
Here, the tiger uses the fire within yin to refine the Qian dragon,
And the dragon then emits the fire of Kunlun to respond.
When the fires of these two things merge and harmonize,
The essence of the True One naturally congeals.
At that moment, gather and consume it,
And all the bones will be ordered, and fragrance will arise.

After consuming the elixir, once more circulate the fire of the yin-yang talisman. The tiger employs the fire within yin to refine this Mysterious Gate, and the dragon then emits the fire of Kunlun in response. When these two things merge and harmonize, the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir naturally ripens, and the entire body radiates brilliance and fragrance. This describes the inner and outer images.

**Fourteen**
If Li and Kan lack the wu-ji,
Though they contain the Four Images, the elixir will not form.
Only because each harbors the True Earth,
Can the Golden Elixir achieve return and restoration.

**Ye Shibiao says:**
Li is fire, and fire is born of wood.
Kan is water, and water issues from metal.
Though Kan and Li contain the Four Images,
Without the wu-ji’s central qi ascending and descending between them,
They can never produce the divine elixir.
The *Cantong Qi* states: “Kan’s wu is the moon’s essence; Li’s ji is the sun’s light.”
For Kan and Li receive wu and ji.

**Yuan Gongfu says:**
Kan conceals the six wu, the moon’s essence,
The position of yang within yang, residing in the north.
The moon is yin, while wu is yang—
This is yang within yin, like the metal tiger born within water.
Li conceals the six ji, the sun’s light,
The position of yin within yang, residing in the south.
The sun is yang, while ji is yin—
This is yin within yang, like the mercury dragon born within fire.
The *Cantong Qi* states: “Kan’s wu is the moon’s essence; Li’s ji is the sun’s light.”
The *Longhu Shangjing* says:
“Kan is the essence of male metal; Li is the light of female fire.”
If the sun and moon lack the wu-ji’s central darkness ascending and descending between them,
Though they contain the qi of the Four Images,
They cannot produce the divine elixir or illuminate the cosmos.
One who comprehends the principle of return and restoration,
Aligning wu and ji in their proper positions,
Can summon the qi of the Three Lights and Five Phases,
Produce the elixir,
And thereby attain longevity and enduring vision.

**Wumingzi says:**
“Li’s ji is the sun’s light; Kan’s wu is the moon’s essence.”
Thus, Li’s ji resembles the dragon’s bowstring qi,
And Kan’s wu resembles the tiger’s bowstring qi.
When dragon and tiger embrace the True Earth of wu and ji,
They unite as one body,
The Four Images converge, and the elixir is formed—
Hence it is called “return and restoration.”

**Fifteen**
The sun dwelling in Li’s position becomes female;
The moon paired with the Toad Palace is male.
If one fails to grasp this principle of inversion,
Do not presume to discourse on such lofty matters with mere superficial understanding.

**Ye Shibiao says:**
Li is the sun, containing the Moon Crow within—
Outwardly yang, inwardly yin.
Kan is the moon, containing the Sun Hare within—
Outwardly yin, inwardly yang.
Thus, Li receives ji, and Kan receives wu.

**Yuan Gongfu says:**
The sun contains the Moon Crow—yang within yin.
The moon contains the Sun Hare—yin within yang.
All things born between heaven and earth follow this pattern;
Otherwise, they cannot be transformed and generated.
If a student of the Dao fails to comprehend this principle of inversion,
Relying instead on empty words and clever arguments,
It is utterly meaningless.

**Sixteen**
Take the solid center from Kan’s position,
And use it to transmute the yin within Li’s belly.
From this, it transforms into the vigorous body of Qian,
And all hidden and manifest movements become subject to the heart’s will.

**Yuan Gongfu says:**
When Kan’s central line interchanges with Li’s,
It forms the Qian trigram.
Kan is the moon; Li is the sun.
The *Cantong Qi* states: “The sun receives the moon’s transformation,”
And the Qian dragon’s transformations—its hidden and manifest movements—
All arise from the central line.
Thus, a person’s transformations and transcendence of the ordinary
Also depend on the True Earth.

**Wumingzi says:**
Li is outwardly yang and inwardly yin;
Kan is outwardly yin and inwardly yang.
Using the inner yang to transmute the inner yin
Forms the Qian trigram.
This is like the Golden Elixir—
The utmost yang qi, called the Yang Elixir—
Congealing within the Sea of Yin.
When taken to transmute one’s own yin mercury,
It becomes a body of pure yang.
Thereafter, the regulation of fire, the withdrawal and addition of qi,
And all progress and retreat
Are governed by the heart’s operation.

**Seventeen**
The Zhen dragon’s mercury emerges from Li’s domain;
The Dui tiger’s lead is born in Kan’s direction.
These two things arise because the child produces the mother,
And the Five Phases all depend on entering the center.

**Ye Shibiao says:**
Li fire gives birth to wood mercury;
Kan water gives birth to metal lead—
The mother cherishes the child’s embryo.
Without the Central Palace, they cannot be gathered and refined.

**Yuan Gongfu says:**
Wood originally gives birth to fire as its mother;
Metal originally gives birth to water as its mother.
Yet the Zhen dragon emerges from Li,
And the Dui tiger emerges from Kan—
This is the mother concealing the child’s embryo.
These two things arise from mutual longing and attraction,
Inverted to achieve their union.
If the qi of the Five Phases does not gather and refine within the Central Palace,
They cannot be formed.

**Wumingzi says:**
Mercury is the Zhen dragon, belonging to wood.
Wood is the mother of fire, and fire is the child of wood—
This is the ordinary sequence of the Five Phases.
Yet cinnabar belongs to fire, which is Li,
And mercury is born from cinnabar—
This is fire giving birth to wood in reverse!
Hence it is called “the child producing the mother,”
An inversion of the Five Phases’ sequence.
Lead is the Dui tiger, belonging to metal.
Metal is the mother of water, and water is the child of metal—
This is the ordinary sequence of the Five Phases.
Yet qi-lead belongs to water, which is Kan,
And silver is born from lead—
This is water giving birth to metal in reverse!
Hence it is also called “the child producing the mother,”
Another inversion of the Five Phases’ sequence.
It does not mention silver because the silver within lead is called True Lead.
The center is the Lower Elixir Field,
The Great Central Ultimate.

The Red Dragon and Black Tiger meet in east and west,
The Four Symbols intertwine within the central Wu and Ji.
Once conception occurs and movement begins,
Who can say the Golden Elixir will not succeed?

Ye Shibiao says: Though the Red Dragon and Black Tiger bear names of east and west, they both arise from the central qi of Wu and Ji. If one can employ the ascending and descending movements of the hexagrams Zi and Wu, there is nothing that will not succeed.

Wang Dao’s commentary on the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* states: The sun has three illuminations, the moon has three shifts. When the sun and moon emerge in the east and shine in the west, the true brilliance of the White Tiger’s metal virtue in the west enters into the profound darkness and transforms into the six Wu. When the sun and moon emerge in the west and shine in the east, the true brilliance of the Green Dragon’s wood virtue in the east enters into the profound darkness and transforms into the six Ji. When the sun and moon align at noon and shine in the north, the true qi of the Vermilion Bird’s fire virtue in the south enters into the profound darkness, takes form in earth, and transforms into black lead, ever residing at the primal origin of heaven and earth, becoming the root of all things in the cosmos.

The *Cantong Qi* says: The sun conceals its path yet radiates its splendor; the moon bestows its virtue and unfolds its light. The sun receives the moon’s transformation without harm to its body. If those who cultivate the Elixir can clearly understand the ascending and descending movements of the hexagrams Fu and Gou, then there is no reason the Golden Elixir will not be achieved.

The Nameless Master says: When the Four Symbols intertwine within Wu and Ji, they congeal the essence of True Unity. Obtaining this single grain of true essence, after ingestion, one begins to circulate the fire starting from the Zi hour of the Fu hexagram, advancing the Yang fire until the Wu hour of the Gou hexagram, then advancing the Yin tally. Fu is the first hexagram of Yin and Yang, corresponding to the solstices of winter and summer. From this point, the Yin tally and Yang fire begin, with extraction and addition employed in accordance with the method, ensuring no deviation. Who then can say the work of the Golden Elixir will not succeed?

When the White Tiger of Western Mountain rages unchecked,
The Azure Dragon of Eastern Sea cannot be withstood.
Seize these two beasts and make them fight to the death,
To refine a single lump of purple-golden frost.

Ye Shibiao says: Lead, like metal-water, is the Tiger—substantial and below. Mercury, like wood-fire, is the Dragon—volatile and above. When these two subdue and restrain each other, they transform into the elixir of purple-gold. The two beasts are none other than Dragon and Tiger.

At the peak of Mount Hua, the mighty Tiger roars;
In the depths of Fusang Sea, the female Dragon hums.
Ye Shibiao says: Mount Hua lies in the West, Fusang in the East. Tiger and Dragon each stir from their native realms.

Yuan Gongfu says: Mount Hua’s Tiger is Yang within Yin; Fusang’s Dragon is Yin within Yang. The *Cantong Qi* states: "The radiance of Kan and Li, Yang as Wu and Yin as Ji, when the two earths unite as one, the Yellow Way reveals its principle. The Yellow Dame herself mediates their match, sending them to become husband and wife with a single heart."
Ye Shibiao says: The Yellow Dame is Wu and Ji, who enable Dragon and Tiger to unite as husband and wife. The *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger* states: "Earth dwells at the center, enveloping the four directions. The Three Lights harmonize their measures, bringing about great peace."

As the moon first reveals half its brightness at the sky’s edge,
The roars of Dragon and Tiger resound without delay.
Yuan Gongfu says: When the moon reaches its first quarter, metal and water are evenly balanced—this is the moment when Yin and Yang stand in perfect equipoise, and Dragon and Tiger already roar within it. Now is the time to devote oneself to cultivating the two eights, for within a single double-hour the elixir will be accomplished.
Yuan Gongfu says: Having reached the first quarter, one must wait for the last quarter to complete the measure of two eights making one pound.

The *Cantong Qi* states:
"The first quarter holds the number eight,
The last quarter holds the number eight as well.
When the two quarters merge their essence,
The body of Qian and Kun is perfected."
Thus one should proceed with cultivation at once. The marvel of the Golden Elixir does not lie in three years or nine cycles but reveals the form of the Mysterious Pearl within a single double-hour. This is why the ancient immortals and supreme sages hastened to seize the moment—this is what they meant.

The Nameless Master says: The half-moon represents the number eight. The immortal elder points out that both Dragon and Tiger correspond to the number eight, combining to form sixteen. At this time, the source of water is utterly clear, possessing brilliance without substance. In a single year, there is but one day; in a single day, but one double-hour; within that double-hour, six periods are divided. Without exceeding two periods, one may refine and ingest a single grain of the Golden Elixir. The remaining four periods serve other wondrous purposes—these are celestial secrets, which the immortal elder dared not commit to explicit text but embedded within the passage, vaguely referring to it as "within a single double-hour the elixir is accomplished."

First observe the heavens to discern the Five Thieves,
Then examine the earth to pacify the people.

When the people are at peace and the nation prosperous, only then may one seek battle; only after battle is concluded may one behold the sagely ruler.

The *Yin Fu Jing* states: "Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp the movements of Heaven—this is perfection." Heaven harbors the Five Thieves; those who perceive them shall flourish. The Five Thieves are the Five Stars in heaven and the Five Phases in man. They are called "thieves" because their appearances and concealments are unfathomable. If one can comprehend these five, one may seize the wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth.

The land is oneself. The people are the spirits within the body. When the spirits are at peace, qi and blood harmonize; only then may one proceed with the work, advancing the fire to battle the yin ghosts. When the yin ghosts retreat, the emperor within the self reigns in effortless ease.

The *Cantong Qi* states: "The emperor and king govern eternally, enduring through a thousand autumns."

Master Wumingzi says: The nation is the body; the people are the radiance of essence. The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is firm, the state is at peace. If the state lacks a ruler, to whom shall the people turn? If the ruler lacks ministers, how shall the nation be governed? Thus, the sage makes the elixir the ruler and fire the minister. When elixir and fire depend on each other, ruler and minister rejoice in union, and the world attains great peace. When the radiant essence and people are at ease, the nation of the self is enriched.

Twenty-Three
When deploying generals, one must divide them into left and right armies. Let them take the lead as host while I remain the guest.

In all matters of battle, never underestimate the enemy,
lest you lose the priceless treasure of our house.
Ye Shibiao says: This speaks of the mutual resonance of two substances, akin to deploying generals by dividing them into left and right, host and guest—taking true lead as the host and circulating inner fire to draw in the outer mercury.

Laozi says: No misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy; to do so is to lose the treasure of one’s house. This warns that the regulation of fire, its withdrawal and addition, must be handled with utmost care.

Yuan Gongfu says: In this chapter, the Perfected One uses the analogy of host and guest in military deployment as a caution. When generals command troops, if they do not divide them into formations, chaos ensues without order. Only by splitting the army into left and right can one drill formations and secure victory. This originally serves as a metaphor for yin and yang. Had it further divided into five armies, discord would have led to defeat. When the guest meets the host, demeanor must be dignified, movements reverent and solemn—only then can the host extend due respect. If actions are hasty and words disordered, one will surely be despised. The same applies to regulating fire: let what is there be the host, while I remain the guest. As long as fire adheres to its rhythm and yin-yang remains balanced, the spirit settles, breath steadies, not a single thought arises, and continuity persists without strain—how then could loss occur?

Master Wumingzi says: This passage clarifies the application of fire timing. The general is fire; the left is civil fire, the right is martial fire. In firing, from *zi* to *si* (the six yang hours) corresponds to spring and summer’s generative virtue, hence civil fire resides on the left, called yang fire. From *wu* to *hai* (the six yin hours) mirrors autumn and winter’s stern punishment, hence martial fire resides on the right, called yin tally. Fire, as host, is yang and masculine, fond of contention; the guest, as yin and feminine, prefers stillness. "Let the other be host while I remain guest" means embracing the feminine without striving, maintaining stillness without contention—this is the intent to guard against peril and prevent danger. It is like a guest meeting the host: advancing and retreating with reverence, never daring to act rashly.

In regulating fire, first set the water clock to distinguish *zi* and *wu*, then harmonize yin and yang to establish the foundation for transformation. Distribute the sixty-four hexagrams within the yin tally, animate the twenty-four qi with yang fire. The celestial pivot rests in the hand, the earthly axis takes form in the heart—this is the key ford of the seventy-two seasonal nodes. Bore into the crucible, seize the three thousand six hundred breaths of primal qi, and infuse them into the embryo’s core. Be vigilant in withdrawal and addition, concentrate on the operation, guard against danger, prevent peril, ensuring not a single moment is misaligned nor a fraction of a degree amiss. Thus, externally, one harmonizes with the lightning tally of yin and yang; internally, the body of true unity is born. If, however, the mind is not reverent and the rhythm of the nodes is disrupted, the maiden flees, the numinous embryo fails to form, and the priceless treasure of the returned elixir is lost.

Wood gives birth to fire, yet its edge remains concealed;
Without knowing how to drill and refine, do not forcefully attack.
Disaster arises from this self-inflicted harm—
One must seek the Metal Elder to subdue it.

Ye Shibiao says: This speaks of extracting mercury from lead. Mercury hides within lead, unseen in form, just as fire is born from wood yet its brightness remains hidden. Without the method of withdrawal and addition, do not forcefully extract it, lest harm ensue. For disasters and calamities arise from carelessness in fire timing. One must first have the Metal Mother within; only then will mercury appear and lead be subdued. Without this host, what can mercury seek?

Yuan Gongfu says: Fire is born from wood, for wood thrives with fire as its vital spirit, inherently concealing its sharpness, reluctant to manifest externally. If stirred, it will instead be consumed by the very wood it inhabits. As the *Yin Fu Jing* states: Fire arises from wood, and disaster inevitably follows; treachery arises in the state, and collapse comes with movement. Those who understand this in cultivation are called sages. To attain the tranquility of wood, one must borrow metal to fell it. As the *Cantong Qi* says: Metal fells wood to flourish.

The Metal Elder is originally the Eastern House’s son,
Sent to the Western Neighbor to lodge and take form.

Ye Shibiao says: The Metal Elder is lead. Lead is the mother of white metal, formed by the coagulation of mercury, hence called the Eastern House’s son. In the five phases, metal is conceived in *mao*. The Western Neighbor refers to the moon’s third-day crescent appearing in the west.

Master Wumingzi says: The Green Dragon and White Tiger are both the essence of true unity, transformed into two substances, occupying east and west—truly the same in origin yet different in name. True unity’s essence belongs to mercury; mercury is the Dragon, in the east. The White Tiger is originally the child of true unity’s essence, lodging in the west.

Recognize it, summon it back to the chamber to nurture,
And pair it with the maiden to forge kinship.

Ye Shibiao says: Knowing that lead is produced by mercury and stored in the Central Palace, one then circulates numinous mercury inward to unite with it.

Twenty-Six
The maiden wanders with her own direction—
Advance must be brief, retreat must be long.

Ye Shibiao says: This speaks of true mercury following the Great Yin to be born, inherently possessing its own direction and sequence. "Brief" is the yin line; "long" is the yang line. Before noon, seek yin to become yang; after noon, seek yang to become yin—like *kun* transforming into *fu* or *qian* into *gou*.

Yuan Gongfu says: The maiden is Wood Mercury. What she wanders with is the Great Yin. Mercury follows the Great Yin to be born, possessing its own direction. From the third day, when the moon reveals its *geng* phase, until the first quarter on the eighth day, it resides only within the span of five or six days—is this not "advance must be brief"? Then, from the fifteenth to the twenty-third, the waning moon lingers beyond eight or nine days—is this not "retreat must be long"?

The advance must be brief, the retreat must be long; from yang to yin, from yin to yang—only thus can generation be inexhaustible. The True Man expounds in myriad ways, yet speaks only of the character "center."

Master Wuming says: The maiden is mercury, called "mercury fire." That which wanders with direction—its advance is the work of the outer medicine, employing two *hou* within one *shi*, hence "must be brief"; its retreat is the work of the inner medicine, employing four *hou* within one *shi*, hence "must be long." With these two functions, it is said to possess its own direction. When the sage first begins to refine the golden elixir, moving the mercury fire for no more than half a *shi*, he immediately obtains the essence of the True One, as large as a millet grain, to be swallowed—thus the advance must be brief. After ingesting the elixir, he again moves his own mercury fire, requiring the work of ten months—thus the retreat must be long.

Returning, he enters the Yellow Dame’s chamber,
Marrying the golden elder to become the old groom.

Ye Shibiao says: The numinous mercury wanders above and below, returning to the central palace to unite with lead, also congealing into lead.

Yuan Gongfu adds: When the monthly reckoning ends, it returns to *kun*. "Marrying the golden elder" means yin mercury once more follows the birth and dissolution of yang lead, cycling endlessly.

Wang Dao says: Since the beginning of creation, it has cycled without end—truly, he may be called the old groom.

27.
Even if you recognize cinnabar and black lead,
Without knowing the fire-timing, it is as idle as a distracted mind.
The great work relies entirely on sustaining power;
A hair’s deviation, and the elixir will not form.

Ye Shibiao says: Though you know cinnabar produces mercury and black lead generates silver, without knowing the fire-timing, you cannot bring about transformation. For the primordial essence is the divine spirit and true essence within the crucible, the qi of Heaven and Earth—unseen, untouchable, yet able to respond to the mechanism of change and generate the myriad things. Since it is profoundly obscure and difficult to fathom, one must establish symbolic verification to regulate it. If mercury and lead are unstable, their weights deviate, hardness and softness act in excess, failing to interpenetrate, then the elixir will not form.

Thus True One says: If the yang fire exceeds its mark, water and drought become unbalanced, and freezing winter turns into scorching summer. If the yin tally loses its rhythm, cold and warmth encroach upon each other, and midsummer reverts to thick frost. If the golden palace fails to sprout mercury and cinnabar, then within the crucible, insects and worms arise; in great cases, mountains collapse and the earth splits, the metal tiger and wood dragon boil over; in minor cases, violent rain and whirlwinds strike, the kan male and li female flee in chaos. From this, we see that even if you recognize the two substances, lead and mercury, without understanding the fire-timing, it is all in vain.

Wang Dao says: The divine elixir of golden liquid depends entirely on the fire-timing. Fire is the parent of the medicine; the medicine is the descendant of fire.

Master Wei Lü says: For one who fully grasps the Dao of nature and destiny, nothing surpasses the Yellow Emperor’s golden elixir. The marvel of the golden elixir lies in the fire record; the marvel of the fire record lies in the mutual interaction of *kan* and *li*, generating transformation and spiritual illumination. Thus, it is clear that without the fire-timing, lead and mercury cannot form the elixir. In the past, Elder Cui transmitted to the Perfected Lü the *Heavenly Origin Mirror for Entering the Medicine*, precisely to ensure he thoroughly investigated the fire work. Scholars should devote themselves wholeheartedly to this.

28.
The *Cantong Qi* and scriptures discuss the ultimate truth,
Yet do not commit the fire-timing to writing.
To know the oral secrets that penetrate the mysterious,
You must discuss them in detail with an immortal.

Master Daoguang says: The sage transmits the medicine but not the fire; since ancient times, few have known the fire-timing. Do not treat the great Dao as child’s play—you must deliberate carefully with an immortal. Thus, the fire-timing cannot be understood unless encountered by a perfected one who transmits it mind-to-mind.

Master Wuming says: The *Fire Record* has six hundred chapters, each resembling the others, interweaving and aligning with the celestial degrees. What Heaven has concealed, the sage does not transmit—when you meet a venerable teacher, do not act recklessly.

29.

On the fifteenth of the eighth month, the toad’s glow fills the meal—
This is precisely when metal’s essence is at its peak.
When the first yang arises in revival,
Begin the firing without delay.

Master Yeshi Biao says: The moon of Great Yin waxes full each month, yet on the fifteenth of the eighth month it shines brightest, for this is the extreme of Great Yin. The moon is metal, and metal flourishes in *you*; when yin reaches its limit, yang is born—thus the firing is prolonged, resembling the moment between *hai*’s end and *zi*’s beginning. Those who take the cinnabar elixir on the fifteenth of the eighth month are mistaken.

Master Yuan Gongfu says: The elixir is metal, and metal flourishes in *you*; thus, by the fifteenth of the eighth month, the time of metal and water’s full vigor arrives, and it is brightest. In all under heaven, when things reach their height they must decline, and when yang reaches its peak yin arises. By the tenth month, in the *kun* hexagram, the yin tally is nearly exhausted; yet since yin cannot be utterly extinguished, yang is about to be born. At the winter solstice, the *fu* hexagram arises, and so the firing begins anew in cyclical return, aligning with the year’s celestial timing. The Dao of the elixir is no different: if one cultivates in accord with the principle of qian and kun’s alternating yin and yang, there is nothing that cannot be achieved. When six appears at *hai*—the position of old yin in the tenth month—yin qi reaches its extreme. Six is the number of yin, and since qian and kun govern the transformations of yin and yang, the seventh *gu* brings revival. In the month of *jianzi*, the celestial wheel turns left while the earth’s axis rotates right; qi intermingles and gives birth to the myriad things. By the next winter solstice, each returns to its root. Thus, in terms of the two qi, yang advances as yin retreats. At the summer solstice, yang qi revives at *si*, and at the winter solstice, yin qi revives at *hai*—hence it is called “returning to the root.”

As soon as the first yang stirs, the time for the elixir arrives;
The lead cauldron glows warmly, illuminating the curtains.
At the moment of receiving qi, it is easily recognized—
Yet in drawing and adding, be ever vigilant against danger.

Master Yeshi Biao says: The winter solstice occurs at midnight, the *zi* hour. True lead, within the cauldron chamber, follows the growth of yang qi, warming like a lamp’s light shining through the curtains. “At the moment of receiving qi” refers to its endowment—just as metal is gestated in *mao*, wood in *you*, fire in *zi*, and water and earth in *wu*. Though this is easily known, one must exercise caution in the work of drawing and adding.

Master Yuan Gongfu says: This speaks of the initial effort. At the moment of receiving qi, attainment is quite easy, but in the work of drawing and adding, there is both safety and peril—one must be vigilant. The *Cantong Qi* says: “Erect a gnomon as a standard, observe the signs to determine fortune or misfortune, issue commands in accord with the seasons, and never miss the moment when the lines move.”

Master Wuming says: At the *zi* hour of the first yang, within the elixir cauldron, true lead is refined by fire, its light penetrating the curtains. Obtaining it in that moment is quite easy, yet within it lies the labor of ten months—drawing and adding, guarding against danger and navigating peril.

The mysterious pearl takes form as yang is born,
When yang reaches its peak, yin wanes and its shape is gradually stripped away.
After ten months of frost, the elixir ripens—
At the thought of it, even gods and ghosts must tremble.

Master Yeshi Biao says: The mysterious pearl is mercury, which arises with the growth of yang, like the moon borrowing the sun’s light to shine. When yang flourishes, yin qi is worn away. “Ten months” refers to the elixir in the cauldron, like a child in the womb—once its time is complete, it matures into pure yang, and gods and ghosts submit in awe. The *Cantong Qi* says: “It resembles a chicken’s egg, black and white supporting each other, one *cun* in length and breadth as its beginning. The four limbs and five viscera, sinews and bones, all take shape. After ten months, it emerges from the womb.”

Between the waxing crescent and the waning crescent,
The medicine’s flavor is balanced, and its qi is whole.

Gathered and returned, it is forged within the furnace,
Forged and tempered, nurtured like simmering fresh fish.

Master Yeshi Biao says: Between the waxing crescent and the waning crescent—when the cassia orb is clear and full—lies the time when the medicine’s qi is balanced and whole. At this moment, the adept refines it, then proceeds to gentle nurturing. "Simmering fresh fish" means treating it like cooking small fish: the fire must neither overreach nor fall short, nor should it be disturbed. It must be left to mature naturally. As Laozi says: "Governing a great state is like cooking small fish."

Master Yuan Gongfu says: Between the waxing crescent and the waning crescent—on the fifteenth day—when the cassia orb is clear and full, its qi is whole. If one can follow the method of the Great Yin, establishing the divine crucible to refine the elixir, there will be no difference. For the Great Yin transforms from *Kun* to *Zhen* and *Dui*, ascending to the pure yang of *Qian*—this too is a process of gentle nurturing, from softness to hardness. The method of advancing the fire resembles cooking small fish: if the fire is too strong, it becomes brittle and easily scorched; if too weak, it remains soft and unripe. Gentle nurturing means regulating the fire’s intensity.

An Unknown Master says: On the eighth day, the second yang arises, forming the *Dui* hexagram. At this time, the po is half within the hun, its balance straight as a string—hence the waxing crescent. The preceding phase belongs to yang, the following to yin; within yin, half is yang, yielding eight ounces of metal within water. Its flavor is balanced, its qi whole. By the fifteenth day, the three cauldrons are prepared, symbolizing the *Qian* hexagram. Now the yin po’s water is exhausted, and the yang hun’s metal fills the wheel—thus it is full and round, pure yang without yin, hence the full moon. Yet when yang reaches its peak, yin arises: on the sixteenth day, a single yin is born within the pure yang wheel, symbolizing the *Xun* hexagram. Gradually it wanes, and by the twenty-third day, the second yin arises, symbolizing the *Gen* hexagram. At this time, the hun is half within the po, its balance straight as a string—hence the waning crescent. The preceding phase belongs to yin, the following to yang; within yang, half is yin, yielding half a catty of water within metal. Its flavor is balanced, its qi whole. Thus the sage compares these two eights, gathering them into the alchemical furnace to forge the true unity of qi, transforming it into a single grain to be swallowed into the five viscera. Then, employing the fire of the post-full-moon phase, it is simmered and refined into the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir.

The eldest son first drinks the western waters,
The youngest daughter first blooms the northern flowers.
If the Azure Maiden should meet them thereafter,
All at once the Yellow House is sealed shut.

Master Ye Shibiao says: This speaks of the fire phases.
*Zhen* is the eldest son, *Dui* the youngest daughter.
*Xun* is the eldest daughter, belonging to wood, called the Azure Maiden.
*Gen* and *Kun* belong to earth, called the Yellow House.
It says: When *Zhen* transforms once into *Dui*, the divine water is born;
when *Dui* transforms once into *Qian*, the golden flower congeals.
When *Qian* transforms once into *Xun*, from *Xun* a single yin arises—
its medicine is all contained and guarded within the Central Palace.

The *Cantong Qi* says:
On the third day *Zhen* stirs,
On the eighth day *Dui* moves.
When the three and five virtues are complete,
The body of *Qian* is formed.
*Xun* inherits its lineage,
Firmly securing the time of refinement.
*Gen* governs advance and retreat,
Yet cannot be grasped in words.
The six and five of *Kun* uphold,
Serene and tranquil from beginning to end.
Lightly nurturing the many children,
It becomes the mother of all kinds.

Master Yuan Gongfu says:
The eldest son is *Zhen-mao*, the Greater Yang.
The youngest daughter is *Dui-you*, the Greater Yin.
"First" and "initial" both mean the beginning.
The Greater Yang enters *you* on the first day;
on the third day, the Greater Yin gives birth to a slender crescent.
The "northern flowers" arise from yin to generate yang.
When *Zhen* transforms once into *Dui*, and twice into *Qian*,
both *Dui* and *Qian* belong to metal—
thus on the third day the golden flowers first bloom.
The Azure Maiden is wood-mercury;
by the fifteenth day, it shines full upon the *jia* direction.
If the Greater Yin meets *jia* thereafter,
from *Qian* it transforms into *Xun*, then returns to the position of *Kun*.
The Perfected One uses this to illustrate that when the crucible’s metal and water are at their peak,
precisely at the moment when yin and yang are evenly balanced,
one should swiftly model the barriers and nets,
so that the true mercury has nowhere to escape—
in a single moment, it can be accomplished.
Just as the previous passage says:
"When the time comes to refine the two eights,
Within one double-hour the elixir is complete."

**Thirty-Four**
In the months of the Hare and the Rooster, at their appointed times,
Punishment and virtue arrive at the gate—such is

Ye Shibiao says: *Pi* and *Tai* represent the equilibrium of yin and yang. *Zhun* and *Meng* are the first of the sixty-four hexagrams in the firing of the tally. At dawn, *Zhun*; at dusk, *Meng*—daily employing these two hexagrams, their twelve lines corresponding to the twelve double-hours, taking one as the exemplar.

When yin and yang are evenly balanced, true *qi* fills to abundance, and the *Zhun* and *Meng* hexagrams generate and complete the medicinal substances. The sage takes the hexagrams as his standard, not clinging to the images of the lines.

Master Yuan Gongfu says: When the *qi* of Heaven and Earth conjoin, all things flourish in abundance. *Zhun* and *Meng*, as the first of the sixty-four hexagrams in the firing of the tally, receive their hexagrams and thereby receive generation and completion.

True Unity Master says: In establishing the crucible and moving the celestial mechanism, at first there is no form or substance—just as in the primordial chaos. Once the fire is kindled and the tally set in motion, the first year’s growth begins, day by day and month by month, and the bodies of Dragon and Tiger take shape. If one grasps the profound mystery herein, there is no need to cling to changing images or seek out lines—such efforts only weary the spirit in vain.

The Nameless Master says: When yang *qi* reaches the center of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang are evenly matched, neither cold nor hot but temperate—this is the *Tai* hexagram, like the climate of the moon’s first quarter. At this time, the two *qi* of yin and yang naturally conjoin, so the sage does not advance the firing regimen, calling this "bathing."

When yin descends to the center of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang are evenly matched, neither hot nor cold but chilled—this is the *Pi* hexagram, like the climate of the moon’s last quarter. At this time, the two *qi* of yin and yang naturally intersect, and the sage does not advance the firing regimen, also calling this "bathing."

If one can grasp the meaning within the four hexagrams *Zhun*, *Meng*, *Pi*, and *Tai*, why cling to lines and exhaust the mind with labored thought?

**Thirty-Seven**
Hexagrams set forth images to model forms;
grasp the image, forget the words, and meaning becomes clear.
Later generations, deluded, cling only to images,
pursuing hexagrams in darkness, hoping for ascension.

Ye Shibiao says: The sages established hexagrams and set forth images to reveal the principles of the myriad things’ transformations. The scholar should grasp the image and forget the words.

Master Zhongli’s poem says:
How can the great Dao be conveyed through speech?
Bo Yang borrowed the *Yi* to compose the *Can Tong Qi*.
Later people, failing to recognize the immortals’ metaphors,
clutch at fishing baskets and snares, striving in vain.

Master Yuan Gongfu says: The sages created the *Yi*, drawing hexagrams and setting forth three hundred eighty-four lines to reveal the principles of the myriad things’ transformations. The scholar should grasp the image and forget the words. If one is deluded and clings to the images of the lines, hoping to ascend through hexagrams, is this not far from the mark?

**Thirty-Eight**
Heaven and Earth’s fullness and emptiness have their appointed times;
observe their waxing and waning to know the mechanism.

From of old, the *geng* and *jia* clarify the decree—
slay the Three Worms, and the Dao may be attained.

Ye Shibiao says: Fullness and growth are yin transforming into yang; emptiness and decline are yang transforming into yin. Each has its appointed time. If one can carefully observe the principles of waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness, only then does one grasp the mechanism of creation and transformation. The *geng* and *jia* refer to the third day when the moon emerges at *gengzi*, and the fifteenth when it reaches fullness at *jia*. At these times, one gathers the medicine and advances the fire, just as a ruler issues clear commands to execute yin demons—thus may the true Dao be attained.

The Nameless Master says: The pure yin of the *Kun* hexagram congeals into cold; this is winter, the season when the myriad things withdraw and store—hence it is called emptiness. Heaven and Earth’s fullness and emptiness are revealed through the moon. The moon is born from the sun: on the third day, *Zhen* at *geng* takes form; on the eighth, *Dui* at *ding* reaches the first quarter; on the fifteenth, *Qian* at *jia* fills Heaven and Earth—this is the time of fullness. On the sixteenth, *Xun* at *xin* assumes governance; on the twenty-third, *Gen* at *bing* reaches the last quarter; on the thirtieth, *Kun* at *yi* dissolves Heaven and Earth—this is the time of waning.

**Thirty-Nine**
To keep the Valley Spirit ever undying,
one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.

Ye Shibiao says: When a person embraces the true unity of radiance, it is like the valley containing the spirit of utmost emptiness—though formless, it responds when summoned. If one wishes this true emptiness never to cease, one must take the Mysterious Female as the root. The Mysterious Female is the gateway of yin and yang, the root of Heaven and Earth.

Once true essence returns to the Golden Chamber,
a single spark of numinous light will never depart.

Ye Shibiao says: The palace of the Mysterious Female is the Central Palace, which stores the true qi of the One and generates the golden essence. When true radiance produces golden essence and returns it to its chamber, the numinous light will never leave one’s self. This numinous light is the spirit. By accumulating essence, one generates spirit—yet people dissipate it outward, and so their essence is exhausted and they perish.

The Nameless Master says: Golden essence is the true gold of the divine water in the Flowery Pond, also called the Golden Embryo. The Spirit Chamber is the Primal Palace of the Cinnabar Field, which contains the true essence of the One. In Heaven, it is the Water of Heavenly One.

**Forty**
The gateway of the Mysterious Female is rarely known to the world—
do not mistakenly apply it to the mouth and nose.

Though you refine breath through millennia of exhalation and inhalation,
how can you ever capture the Golden Crow or the Jade Hare?

Master Ye Shibiao says: This chapter discusses the root and foundation.
Laozi said: "The valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female. The gateway of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth."
Yet when people see the word "gateway," they seek its aperture: some take it as the mouth and nose, some as the two orifices beneath the tongue, some as the two kidneys, and some as the union of male and female.
Now, a gateway is simply the place of ingress and egress. The original speck of essence from father and mother first coalesces into the cinnabar prime, then generates the five viscera and six bowels. Between the two kidneys lies the Primal Cavity of Chaos—this is where true qi emerges, and where the elixir, once produced, flows back in.
*The Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* says: "A substance of inch-square dimension unites the Three Powers."
*The Kinship of the Three* says: "A span of one inch serves as the primordial beginning."

Master Yuan Gongfu says: The gateway of the Mysterious Female is the portal through which the sun and moon enter and exit. Few in the world know this—yet if one knows it, harmonizing yin and yang becomes effortless.
The Nameless Master says: The gateway of the Mysterious Female is the root and leaf of Heaven and Earth. Master Wenshu mistakenly identified it as the Primal Cavity of Chaos between the kidneys, not realizing that the Mysterious and the Female are two distinct entities—without these two, how could the myriad things exist? Thus, both inner and outer elixirs emerge from this. The sages guarded this secret, calling it the Reclining Moon Crucible, the Suspended Embryo Cauldron.
The Golden Crow is the golden elixir. The golden elixir restrains one’s native mercury, just as one seizes a rat or as a hawk snatches a hare—it cannot escape.

**Forty-One**
Different names yet the same origin—few comprehend;
these two mysteries hold the essential mechanism.
To preserve life and perfect form, discern gain and loss—
the Purple Gold elixir is most wondrous and numinous.

Master Ye Shibiao says: Laozi said, "These two emerge from the same source yet bear different names"—this speaks of the substance of the Great Dao in its presence and absence.
Some misapply this to lead and mercury, saying lead generates mercury and mercury generates lead, thus different names from the same origin. This can preserve life and perfect form—one must discern its gains and losses.
Those who do not understand dissipate it outward and thus suffer loss; those who understand treasure it within and thus reap benefit.

**Forty-Two**
At first, when there is action, none perceive it;
only when it reaches non-action do the many recognize it.
Though all see non-action as the essential Dao,
who knows that action is the very root?

Master Ye Shibiao says: "Action" refers to the manipulation of talismanic fire in refining the elixir; "non-action" is when form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the true Dao.
Master Yuan Gongfu says: At first, "action" involves the manipulation of talismanic fire to refine the elixir—who could witness this? Only when it reaches the state of non-action, where form and spirit are both wondrous and merge with the true Dao, do the many begin to comprehend. Though all see non-action as the essential mystery of the Dao, who knows that action is its very foundation?

**Forty-Three**
Within the black lies the white—this is the mother of the elixir;
within the male is concealed the female—this is the sacred embryo.

Master Ye Shibiao says: Within the black lies the white—lead yields silver, and lead is the mother of the elixir. Within the male is concealed the female—cinnabar contains mercury, and mercury is the child within the embryo.

Master Yuan Gongfu says: Within the black lies the white—this is yin within yang. Within the male is concealed the female—this is yang within yin. This alone constitutes the elixir’s mother and the sacred embryo, from which nurturing and generation arise. As Laozi says: *"Know the male, hold to the female, and be a valley to the world."* With constant virtue unsevered, one returns to the state of an infant. *"Know the white, hold to the black, and be a model to the world."* With constant virtue unbroken, one returns to the boundless.

Master Wumingzi says: The kidneys are black, thus resembling black lead, from which lead yields silver. The heart is red, thus resembling cinnabar, within which lies mercury. When the Great One resides in the furnace, one must guard it with care; when the Three Fields gather treasure, they align with the Three Terraces. Master Ye Shibiao says: The Great One is the radiance of embodied truth—guard it with vigilance, lest it escape. The Upper Field is the Mud Pill Palace, the Middle Field the Crimson Palace, the Lower Field the Cinnabar Chamber. When the medicine accumulates and the Three Fields are full, it is like the heavens adorned with the Three Terraces stars.

Master Yuan Gongfu says: The Great One in the furnace resembles the primordial chaos at heaven and earth’s inception, or a child within the mother’s womb—only then can one guard it with care to prevent its escape. The Three Fields gathering treasure speak of the two earths uniting as a jade tablet, transmuting into true gold, like the Northern Dipper adorned with the Three Terraces stars.

**Forty-Four**
Within the indistinct, seek the semblance of form;
within the profound darkness, find the true essence.

Forty-Four
From *having* and *not-having*, each enters the other—
how can mere imagination bring this to fruition?

Master Ye Shibiao says: Laozi speaks of the *huanghu* wherein there is substance, the *yaoming* wherein there is essence. *Huanghu* is the body of yang; *yaoming* is the body of yin. These two generate the elixir—it cannot be accomplished through visualization alone. *Having* is the central line of Kan; *not-having* is the central line of Li. Taking the solid center of the Kan position to transmute the yin within the Li palace—this is the mutual entry of *having* and *not-having*.

Forty-Five
When the Four Images converge, the mysterious body is complete;
where the Five Phases are whole, purple gold shines bright.
The embryo sheds its husk, enters the mouth—throughout the body, sacred;
countless dragons and spirits stand in awe.

Master Ye Shibiao says: "The embryo sheds its husk, enters the mouth" means that when the count is fulfilled and the elixir is formed, it ascends to the Heavenly Valley and descends into the mouth. Master Yuan Gongfu says: When the qi of the Four Images and Five Phases is fully gathered, the mysterious body is complete and purple gold shines. Master Zhenyi explains that this is the fire’s movement through the four seasons and Five Phases’ qi to nourish the divine embryo. "Shedding the husk" refers to the passage of ten months and the embryo’s emergence from the womb. "Entering the mouth" is like Lü the Perfected’s words: "At that time, one drinks the *daogui* oneself." "Throughout the body, sacred" means form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth. At this moment, how could dragons and spirits not be struck with awe?

Forty-Six
Having drunk from the Flowery Pool, the moon congeals its radiance;
riding a golden dragon, one visits the Purple Tenuity.
Master Ye Shibiao says: The Flowery Pool is the primordial cauldron of the elixir. The medicine, originally the qi of the Great Yin, gathers in the cauldron like the moon congealing its radiance. "Riding a golden dragon" speaks of the embryo’s divine transformation, ascending in flight to pay homage to the Purple Tenuity. From then on, after the immortals recognize one,
the tides of the sea and the shifting of mountains and valleys submit to change.

Master Ye Shibiao says: This speaks of the body’s sanctification throughout.

Forty-Seven
To know the method of the Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir,
one must plant the seed in one’s own garden.
No need for forced breath or effort—
naturally, the elixir ripens and the true embryo sheds its husk.

Master Ye Shibiao says: The "garden" is oneself. First, one obtains the true lead, the mother of the medicine, to serve as the seed within. Then, using the natural numbers of heaven and earth, one generates the numinous mercury, coalescing the true embryo. Master Yuan Gongfu says: The Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir cannot be achieved through external medicine alone—it is within oneself. As Lü the Perfected says: "The Sevenfold Returned Elixir lies in refining oneself and awaiting the proper time." One must obtain the true lead, the mother of the medicine, to serve as the seed within. Then, using the natural true fire, one refines and generates the numinous mercury, coalescing the true embryo.

In vain one applies cunning and false effort—
recognize instead the deathless method of another’s household.

Within the flask, ever replenish the Wine of Life;
In the crucible, gather the Elixir of Returned Souls.
Master Ye Shibiao says: This medicine can restore a person’s soul and preserve their life.
Master Yuan Gongfu says: Guard against cunning deceit and false practices, for the farther one strays from the Dao of the Elixir, the more one must discern the true method of deathlessness. The wine and elixir are the golden water within the crucible, capable of restoring the soul and seizing life.

Forty-Nine
A fine brew from Snow Mountain’s peak,
Poured into the Yang Crucible of Creation’s forge.
Should one pass beyond Kunlun to the northwest,
Only then would Zhang Qian meet Ma Gu.
Master Ye Shibiao says: "White" describes its color; "fermented brew" describes its taste. From the Mud Pill Palace it descends, then pours into the Yang Crucible—this is the work of Creation. If one passes beyond Kunlun, only then does matching occur, just as the ancient Zhang Qian rode a raft up the Yellow River to the Celestial River’s constellation of the Weaving Maiden. The northwest is the Gate of Heaven.
Master Yuan Gongfu says: This speaks of the Metal-Water of the West merging with the Wood-Fire of the East, yin seizing yang. If one proceeds further from Qian and Kan toward the northwest, then yang will follow and yin appear. Fundamentally, Metal generates Water, Wood generates Fire—like the numbers of the Three and Five uniting as One. When gathered at the central palace of wu-ji, this is precisely the principle of reversing the sequence for elixir use.

Not knowing the yang essence or host and guest,
How can one discern near from far?
In vain they seal the Gate of Tail and idle the Cavern,
Cursing the multitudes of Jambudvīpa.
Master Ye Shibiao says: The yang essence is the flowing pearl of Great Yang. Host and guest are lead and mercury. What is distant may be discarded; what is near may be cultivated. Those who practice the Dao, failing to recognize the yang essence or distinguish host from guest, how can they know what to discard and what to embrace? Some flow into the arts of the Three Peaks and the Jade Maiden, passing down these practices without cease, often dying without ever discerning right from wrong—how can this not be distinguished?
Master Zhongli says: Cultivating the Real without knowing the root of one’s origin, mistakenly directing body and mind outward in search—how lamentable are the Yellow Valley adepts of the Three Peaks, how many they have led to ruin in this floating life!
An Anonymous Master says: The yang essence is the essence of the True One. The blackness of utmost yang is called the Yang Elixir. One’s own true mercury belongs to yin and serves as the master of the body, nourishing the hundred limbs. When the Yang Elixir arrives from without to restrain one’s yin mercury, the Yang Elixir becomes the host, and one’s own mercury becomes the guest. The two substances, longing for each other, congeal into golden sand, naturally neither flying nor fleeing. Then, with the addition of fire, they are forged into the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir. Thus, the Yang Elixir from without is called distant, while one’s own yin mercury within is called near. Reversing this near and far to determine host and guest—this is how the Dao is accomplished.

Fifty-One
The ten thousand things flourish, each returning to its root;
Returning to the root and recovering life—this is enduring.
Knowing the constant and returning to the origin is rarely grasped;
Acting recklessly invites misfortune, as all have heard.
Master Yuan Gongfu says: The luxuriant growth of the ten thousand things, like the sprouting of grasses and trees, is nothing that does not return to its root. If it were otherwise, how could they wither, flourish, and decay? If one can return to the origin and revert to the primordial, one endures. Master Ye Wenshu says: The constant is the natural. Laozi says: "Not knowing the constant, reckless action brings misfortune."

Ouhleng’s secret transmission of the sword-forging method,
Moye’s metal and water blend the yielding and the firm.
Once refined, it responds to human intent—
A thousand miles to slay demons in a flash of lightning.

Master Ye Shibiao says: Ouye harmonized metal and water, balancing the yielding and the firm to forge the sacred sword. The Perfected One likens the alchemist’s work to this: metal and water must also be harmonized. When the elixir is complete, one knows the future in reverse, and evil cannot draw near.

○ Master Yuan Gongfu says: In this chapter, the Perfected One uses Ouye’s sword-forging as a metaphor. Just as one forges a sword by harmonizing metal and water, matching the yielding with the firm, tempering it to hardness and sharpness, so that when swung it severs all things—cutting hair and cleaving iron—so too does the alchemist harmonize metal and water. When the elixir is complete, one knows the future in reverse, soaring and transforming at will, sweeping away demonic vapors. Though a thousand miles distant, it is as swift as a flash of lightning.

Fifty-Three
Strike bamboo to summon the tortoise to swallow the jade fungus,
Pluck the zither to call the phoenix to drink the knife-point elixir.
Lately, a golden light shines through the body—
This principle is not spoken of to ordinary men.

Master Ye Shibiao says: Striking bamboo stills the breath. The black tortoise is water. Plucking the zither moves the two strings. The red phoenix is fire. Still the breath to raise water and swallow the jade fungus; move the two strings to raise fire and drink the knife-point elixir. When the elixir is complete, golden light shines through the body—this method cannot be explained to ordinary men. The jade fungus is the jade liquid; the knife-point refers to the two earths of Kan and Li, the wu and ji of the trigrams. The "knife" signifies that both substances are metal.

○ The Nameless One says: Striking bamboo signifies the meeting of two things. Plucking the zither signifies the harmony of proper sound and poetry. The flourishing of the dragon’s string is called the jade fungus; the flourishing of the tiger’s string is called the knife-point elixir. This speaks of the dragon and tiger uniting, striking together to become husband and wife, like the harmony of zither and lute. The phoenix is the Vermilion Bird of the South. When the dragon and tiger unite and the golden elixir is refined, it is immediately gathered and ingested into the cinnabar field. Governed by yin mercury, one then empties the mind to move the fire, forgetting emotion to achieve harmony. Moving yin and yang in accord with breath, using breath to employ spirit and qi, using spirit and qi to gather water and fire, using water and fire to refine the embryo-breath—when the embryo-breath is continuous, swimming between Kan and Li, Kan and Li unite to generate the golden liquid. During the firing process, one suddenly feels the true fire rushing upward along the spine to the Mud Pill Palace, with a rushing sound in the head, as if something touches the brain. The niwan suddenly bulges, like chicken eggs descending the "tower of many stories," like mercury—smooth, fragrant, sweet, and incomparably delicious. When this state is felt, the golden liquid return-elixir is achieved. Slowly swallow it into the cinnabar field, continuously and without cease. The five viscera become clear and empty; closing the eyes, one inwardly observes the organs and bowels as if illuminated by a candle. Then, myriad golden lights emerge from the body, coiling and shrouding the form.

Fifty-Four
The medicine meets its qi-class to take form;
The Dao accords with the subtle and formless to become natural.
A single grain of golden elixir swallowed into the belly—
Only then does one know that my life is not ruled by Heaven.

Master Yuan Gongfu says: The moon borrows the sun’s light to shine; thus the Dao is attained within the subtle and formless.

Fifty-Five
The radiant golden elixir is completed in a day—
The ancient immortals’ words are truly worth heeding.
Those who speak of nine years or three years
Are merely procrastinating to extend their days.

Master Zhenyi says: Ingesting one grain, like a millet seed, one knows that each day yields its own elixir. It is like people taking medicine today—only with time does it show effect.

○ Master Yuan Gongfu says: The Way of the golden elixir, if one receives its true transmission, understands the union of tiger and dragon, and grasps the firing times of withdrawal and addition, with both substances perfectly prepared—then in a single day it blazes forth. Thus Peng the Perfected One said: "In a single day, one can seize the primordial qi of 4,220 years from Heaven and Earth." These are the true words of the ancient immortals, carefully considered and not deceptive. If one truly believes in the teachings of side doors, though years accumulate, one will never succeed.

○ Master Wuming says: The great medicine of the golden elixir—an inferior practitioner may complete it in less than half a *shi*, yet with focused intent and ingestion, this "single day" refers to compressing a year’s firing times into one day. Further condensing a day’s work into a single *shi*, thus it is commonly called "a single day."

56.
The great medicine’s cultivation may be easy or difficult—
Know that it depends on both myself and Heaven.
Without accumulated merit and virtuous deeds,
Demonic obstacles will surely arise in droves.

Master Ye Shibiao says: "Easy" speaks to human effort; "difficult" speaks to Heaven’s decree. The immortals of old all performed great meritorious deeds before attaining success.

57.
The Three Powers plunder one another in their time—
This is the mechanism of immortals’ Dao and virtue.
When the myriad transformations settle and all concerns cease,
The hundred bones are ordered, and non-action is realized.

The *Yinfu Jing* says: Heaven and Earth plunder the myriad things; the myriad things plunder Heaven and Earth; humans plunder the myriad things. When the three plunderings are harmonized, the Three Powers transform—thus it is said: "plundering in their time," "the hundred bones ordered," "activating the mechanism," and "the myriad transformations at peace."

58.
The *Yinfu Jing*’s treasured words exceed three hundred;
The *Daode Jing*’s numinous scripture stops at five thousand.
Immortals past and present are without number,
Yet all attain the true principle within these texts.

Master Yuan Gongfu says: The principles of the *Yinfu Jing* were composed by the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, transmitted to later generations. Its profound and subtle essence is fully expounded therein. From that time onward, those who transcend the ordinary and reach sagehood have never strayed from the purport of the *Yinfu Jing* and *Daode Jing*.

59.
Though your wisdom surpasses Yan [Hui] and Min [Sun],
Without a master’s transmission, do not force guesswork.

Only because the alchemical classics lack oral instructions,
How can you form the numinous embryo?

Master Yuan Gongfu says: Though a thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises record the principles of elixir refinement, as for the hands-on work of forging the union, the subtle intricacies of fire timing—without a master’s personal transmission, even one whose talent surpasses Yan [Hui] and Min [Sun] cannot comprehend them. Master Pingshu [Lu Dongbin] once prefaced: "The ingredients and fire phases are minutely detailed, nothing is left unaddressed. Those of earnest intent may seek the meaning in the words—why insist on oral transmission?" Yet here I speak otherwise, to prevent people from presuming to discuss these matters lightly.

60.
Once the mind-ape is tamed and the square-inch mechanism stilled,
Three thousand meritorious deeds align with Heaven.
Naturally, the cauldron cooks dragon and tiger;
Why cling to home, yearn for wife and child?

Master Yuan Gongfu says: The spirit-chamber is the tally of clarity and wisdom, the pivot and linchpin of the elixir. Though but an inch in breadth, it governs the entire body. It is likened to an ape for its leaping, untamable nature. When the cultivator of the elixir has mastered its regulation, silently conforming to the undifferentiated principle of Heaven and Earth, and when meritorious deeds are complete, only then can one ascend in flight, attaining a lifespan equal to Heaven’s. Yet people today remain unaware that within themselves lies the primordial cauldron of chaos, capable of refining true lead and true mercury. Instead, they cling to wives and brothers, drowning in desires—how lamentable!

61.
If you have not yet refined the returning elixir, refine it swiftly;
Once refined, know when to stop and be content.
Should you persist in grasping at fullness with an insatiable heart,
You will not escape one day meeting ruin and disgrace.

Master Yuan Gongfu says: Failing to refine the golden liquid returning elixir is foolishness. Yet refining without knowing when to stop will harm the elixir. Thus, Master Zhongli [Quan] wrote: "When the medicine is ripe, do not continue the fire phase—further firing will damage the elixir."

62.
You must turn the gate of death into the gate of life;
Do not cling to the gate of life and call it the gate of death.
Only when you grasp the mechanism of killing and understand reversal
Will you know that harm conceals grace, and grace arises from harm.

Master Yuan Gongfu says: People know that the yang line of life contains death, but they do not realize that death holds a principle by which one may escape. Often, they turn their backs on life and rush toward death, delighting without remorse. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: "The ghostly path is joyous—it is the human gate of life." If one can reverse the mechanism of life and death, understanding the principle of reversal, then death may be turned back into life. The *Yinfu Jing* says: "Life is the root of death; death is the root of life. Grace arises from harm; harm arises from grace."

63.
Fortune and misfortune ever intertwine, each lying in wait for the other,
Just as echo follows sound, shadow follows form.
If you can reverse this mechanism of life and death,
In the space of a hand’s turn, calamity becomes blessing.

Master Yuan Gongfu says: Yang gives life, yin brings death. Yang pertains to wood, which conceals fire; yin pertains to metal, which generates water. Who in the world does not know that metal overcomes wood, and water extinguishes fire? Yet this killing principle governs all people, leaving them without the means to transform. They do not realize that misfortune lies in wait within fortune, and fortune is concealed within misfortune—just as echo follows sound, shadow follows form. If one can grasp this and reverse the mechanism of life and death, then in the space of a hand’s turn, calamity may become blessing, and death may be escaped—so easily is it spoken! The *Yinfu Jing* says: "Mutual generation and mutual destruction are the principle of the Dao."

64.
Cultivate the Dao while mingling with the world, harmonizing your light;
Round when round, square when square.
Manifest or hidden, yielding or resistant—none can fathom,
How then could others perceive your conduct and concealment?

Laozi said: "Harmonize your light, blend with the dust." The *Book of Changes* states: "Harmonizing the relationship between Heaven and humanity is the true secret of cultivation." Be square when the situation is square, round when it is round—just as Mencius said of human nature being like water: "Pour it to the east, it flows east; pour it to the west, it flows west." Hidden or manifest, resistant or yielding—none can discern or perceive your conduct and concealment.

Five Quatrains
I.

Though you may fully awaken to the True Suchness of your nature,
You still must cast off this body only to re-enter another.
How much better to cultivate the Great Elixir as well—
Instantly transcend the leakless and become a true person.

Master Lü’s *Precelestial Great Learning* states: "The *Book of Changes* says: 'Qian and Kun transform, each rectifying its nature and destiny.' The Dao of transformation—nature—arises from nonbeing into being, yet relies on destiny as its body. Destiny arises from being into nonbeing, using nature as its function. When nature is disordered by emotion, destiny declines with desire. When destiny flourishes, spirit is whole and nature thrives; when destiny wanes, nature weakens and spirit dims. Nature is the Dao. Spirit is its function, its stillness, the yin within yang. Destiny is life, its substance, its movement—the yang within yin. These two are mutually indispensable; thus, solitary yang cannot stand, lone yin cannot endure. Only when substance and function are both complete does the wondrous Dao arise."

Master Lü said: "To comprehend emptiness yet not refine the Elixir is to leave the yin spirit stranded for ten thousand kalpas, far from sagehood." Master Dou said: "To seek awakening through Chan, believing you’ve seen your nature—how can you know the dream is not delusion? Like a mad monkey grasping at the moon’s reflection in water, how can you seize the moon’s light itself?"

II.
Rebirth, soul-transference, and relocation—
Old dwellers are but followers of the Four Fruits.
If you can subdue the dragon and tame the tiger,
The house of true gold will never decay.

III.
The method of inspecting form, holding breath, and contemplating spirit
Is arduous at first but smooth later.
Though in an instant you may traverse ten thousand lands,
You still abandon the old and relocate—what then?

The meaning of these two verses aligns with Pengzu’s method of breath-holding: if practiced in motion, it can lead to samadhi and spirit-projection. Yet how can the spirit—being yin—firmly stabilize its dwelling? And if one constantly employs the method of relocation, how can one return yang, transmute the bones, and ascend to heaven in broad daylight?

IV.
The Buddha’s teaching urges cultivation of the Land of Bliss,
Yet the Land of Bliss is itself the Golden Region.
For the most part, form and appearance are real only here—
The other two are false, their measure deceptive.

The Buddha’s cultivation of the Western Paradise is none other than the Golden Elixir. Though quiescence and extinction are its essence, it still proceeds through the Golden Flower to attainment—otherwise, why call it the Great Awakening? The *Sutra of the Golden Immortal* states: "The Tathagata’s enlightenment arose from the Golden Flower. Born in a royal palace, he boldly left the household life. Entrusting his life, he feigned feeding tigers; discarding form, he borrowed the metaphor of sprouting bamboo." Later Chan patriarchs took emptiness and quiescence as essential, unaware of the Golden Flower’s meaning. Only Fu Dashi grasped it, saying: "Rare indeed! The Buddha’s wondrous principle is supreme." As the *Mud Pill Palace* states: "Ah, subduing and abiding—abiding in subduing—this is Ananda’s attainment." Long ago, the Dragon Girl’s sudden awakening to the mind-jewel led her directly to Buddhahood—this is the method.

Pengzu said: "If cultivators, weary of this illusory form, cannot refine the Golden Elixir but instead seek the Tathagata’s true emptiness—serene, constant quiescence—this is the ultimate Nirvana Samadhi. Then this body, these words, are all to be discarded."

V.
Common sayings often align with the sagely Dao—
Seek within them with careful inquiry.

If one can invert the search within daily use,
Dust and sand of heaven and earth all turn to treasure.

Common speech, though unassuming, often veils the sagely Dao—
Thus the Dao ever abides within daily affairs,
Yet people pass by without knowing.

**Five-Character Verse**
The maiden dons azure robes,
The young lord wraps in white silk.

Ye Shibiao says: The *li* maiden is wood-mercury;
The *kan* youth is white metal.
○ Yuan Gongfu says: The maiden is yin;
Azure robes are yang—yang within yin.
The young lord is yang;
White silk is yin—yin within yang.
The two substances depend on each other for function.
What is seen cannot be used;
What is used cannot be seen.

Ye Shibiao says: That which leaks outward cannot be employed;
How then can what is used inwardly be seen?
○ The Nameless Master says: What has form and can be seen
Belongs to the dregs of later heaven.
What is formless and invisible
Is the primal radiance of the two substances at their first crescent.
Thus, though unseen, it may yet be used.

Within the dim and indistinct they meet,
In profound obscurity, transformation occurs.
Ye Shibiao says: The two radiant vapors intermingle to generate change.

In a flash, flames take flight—
The true person naturally emerges.
Ye Shibiao says: When yin is wholly stripped away
And the elixir transmutes into yang,
The yang spirit comes and goes.
○ Master Lü says:
After nine years of true fire-tending,
Suddenly the Heavenly Gate bursts open atop the head—
The true person appears in great spiritual power,
From which celestial immortals may offer congratulations.

**Western River Moon**

The True Person says:
West is the direction of metal,
River the body of water,
Moon the medicine’s essence—
The inner elixir mirrors the outer,
Inner passage clear, the outer must follow.
The cinnabar head blends as one,
Warmed and nurtured through myriad transformations.

Yuan Gongfu says:
Inner and outer medicines are the same—
To know the inner, first know the outer.
Both use lead and mercury as the cinnabar head,
Yet the methods of warming and nurturing differ in two ways.

○ The True One says:
Before heaven and earth merged in primordial chaos,
True Lead attained the One and took form first,
Gradually giving rise to heaven and earth, yin and yang, the Five Phases, and all things.
With the precelestial yang elixir,
One touches one’s own yin mercury,
Instantly transmuting it into pure yang.
Then, circulating it within the body,
One refines the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir—
Its transformations occurring within,
Thus called the inner medicine.
After ten months of work, the embryo matures and the form dissolves into pure yang qi,
Then, embracing the Origin for nine years,
One gathers qi back into spirit,
Spirit merging with the Dao,
Ascending into formlessness.
Therefore, both inner and outer medicines
Are the unchanging precelestial,
How could one mistake the postcelestial’s dense yin qi
For the inner medicine?

The outer medicine is the Golden Elixir,
Its transformations occurring in the crucible of the two eights,
Achieved in less than half an hour.
The inner medicine is the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir,
Its transformations occurring within one’s own belly,
Requiring a full ten months to birth the sacred embryo.
Though both medicines blend the cinnabar head in similar ways,
Their methods of firing and timing differ greatly.

Within, the natural true fire
Burns crimson in the furnace.
Without, the external crucible demands diligent effort—
Nothing surpasses the wondrous true seed.

Yuan Gongfu says:
The inner medicine refines with the fire of natural true yang,
While the outer medicine also relies on firing and withdrawal.
The True Person compares the outer medicine to the inner
To emphasize its reality,
Yet nothing surpasses one’s own true seed.

○ The Nameless One says:
Though the inner elixir possesses the natural true fire,
Burning crimson in the earthen crucible,
It still depends on the external furnace’s diligent effort—
Withdrawing and adding, refining without error,
Lest it falter.
Yet the endless transformations of inner and outer true fire
Truly rely on the wondrousness of True Lead.
This substance alone can capture mercury,
Preventing its flight.
Though the two medicines differ in inner and outer,
Their function follows one Dao.
The reason for inner and outer medicines
Is that the human body, endowed with heaven and earth’s essence,
Takes form through yin and yang’s molding.
Within this form, essence and qi are the foundation—
Spirit arises from qi, qi from essence.
Yet these three are all postcelestial qi,
Born of the One, dense yin substances.
Practitioners of the Dao refine nothing beyond essence, qi, and spirit,
But these three, being postcelestial and purely yin,
How can they transform into pure yang
And transcend heaven and earth?

The True One says:
Lone yin cannot generate—
One must seek the precelestial’s One qi,
Using true yin and true yang, substances of the two eights and same kind,
Captured within a single hour,
To refine a grain of pure yang elixir,
Called True Lead.
Its transformations occurring without,
Thus called the outer medicine.
With this yang elixir, one captures one’s own yin mercury,
Like a cat pouncing on a mouse.
The yang elixir is heaven’s mother qi,
One’s own mercury is heaven’s child qi—
With mother qi subduing the child’s yin,
Are they not of the same kind?
Its transformations occurring within,
Thus called the inner medicine.

○ The True One says:
Before heaven and earth merged in chaos,
True Lead attained the One and was born,
Giving rise to heaven and earth, yin and yang, the Five Phases, and all things—
Proof that the Golden Elixir is the precelestial’s One qi.
With the precelestial yang elixir, one touches one’s own yin mercury,
Transmuting it into pure yang.
Then, employing the firing of yin and yang symbols,
Withdrawing and adding,
After ten months of work, the form dissolves into qi,
Qi into spirit,
Spirit merging with the Dao into formlessness,
Its transformations unfathomable.
Thus one transcends heaven and earth,
Stands beyond creation,
Commands heaven and earth,
Molds yin and yang without being molded by them—
All through the precelestial’s One qi.
Hence it is said: Nothing surpasses the wondrous true seed.
How could one mistake the postcelestial’s dense yin qi
For the inner medicine?
How could one take postcelestial cinnabar, mercury, or impure substances
For the outer medicine?

This Dao is most sacred and divine—
Alas, your fate is meager and hard to bear.

The lead cauldron does not endure till dawn—
At first light, one glimpses the omen of the Mysterious Pearl’s form.

Master True Unity says:
Establish and create the cauldron and vessel,
Move the celestial mechanism—
Then all form and substance vanish,
As if within the primordial chaos of hongmeng.
Once the firing of symbolic fire begins,
The first year’s growth promptly appears.
This Dao may be called most easy.

○ Lord Yuan Fu says:
This Dao is sacred and divine—
Only those with blessed destiny may undertake it.
Harmonizing the qi of lead,
Yet it does not require a full day—
In but a single moment, the omen of the Mysterious Pearl’s form appears.

The *Cantong Qi* says:
"Examining antiquity, we return to the Primordial Sovereign,
To the gatekeeper at the beginning of creation.
Capping and marriage, qi intertwines,
The first year’s sprouting then emerges."

If the aspirant can cultivate and refine,
Why be bound to court or marketplace?
The work is easy, the medicine not distant—
Revealed, it moves men to laughter.

Lord Yuan Fu says:
For those with the will to cultivate and refine,
If they grasp the method,
Neither marketplace nor court can hinder them.
The work is most easy, the medicine not remote—
Once explained, there is little to it.

Laozi says:
"When lesser men hear the Dao,
They laugh greatly—
Were they not to laugh, it would not be the Dao."

The White Tiger’s first classic is the supreme treasure...

Ye Shibiao says: "The *first* refers to the head. The White Tiger is the harmonized metal in its initial crystallization. This speaks of the metal essence descending from atop Kunlun—this is the supreme treasure. The world mistakes a woman’s *tiangui* for the first classic, but this is incorrect."

Lord Yuan Fu says: "The White Tiger is black lead, which contains within it the True One’s water, the primal force of heaven and earth and all things. It weaves through the warp and weft of the ten thousand beings—how could it not be the supreme treasure? The divine water of the Flowery Pond is true gold."

Ye Shibiao says: "The Flowery Pond is not the mouth. In the crucible of those who refine the elixir, there is the Metal Mother. The Flowery Pond is also called the Golden Womb, the Divine Chamber, the palace of primordial chaos in the Cinnabar Field. Within it lies the essence of the True One, which in heaven is the water of Heaven One. The aforementioned metal essence is the true gold of the divine water in the Flowery Pond. Thus we know its source is profoundly good and deep, incomparable to ordinary medicinal substances."

Ye Shibiao says: "Laozi says, *'The highest virtue is like water.'* This speaks of the divine water, whose source is deep and far-reaching, not to be equated with common medicinal substances. If one wishes to refine the Nine Revolutions, one must first refine the self and hold fast to the heart. Follow the seasons to gather and determine ascent and descent; advance the fire with caution against grave danger."

Ye Shibiao says: "The Nine Revolutions signify the completion of the elixir. If one desires the great elixir to be perfected, one must refine the self, hold fast to the heart, and concentrate the will—otherwise, it cannot be achieved. Only thus may one follow the ascent and descent of heaven and earth, determine the floating and sinking of the medicine, and advance the fire to refine it. The fire’s timing has its advances and retreats, its withdrawals and additions at the proper seasons. *Grave danger* refers to the fear of losing the medicine."

The Seven Returns: cinnabar returns to its root.
The Nine Revolutions: golden liquid returns to truth.
Do not count from *yin* to *kun* and *shen*;
Observe only the completion of the Five Phases.

Ye Shibiao says: "The Seven Returns is the completion number of fire. The Nine Revolutions is the completion number of metal. This speaks of fire-mercury and metal-lead returning to the primordial sea, called the Seven Returns and Nine Revolutions—not as the ancients counted seven returns from *yin* to *shen* or nine revolutions from *zi* to *jia*. Observe only the completion numbers of the Five Phases, and you will understand."

The Nameless Master says: "Heaven One generates water; Earth Six completes water, dwelling in the north. The accumulated *qi* of Kan’s yin becomes true water—thus it is said *six dwells*. Earth Two generates fire; Earth Seven completes fire, returning to the south to nurture the *qi* of Li and give birth to cinnabar—thus it is said *seven returns*, meaning cinnabar returns to its root. Heaven Three generates wood; Earth Eight completes wood, returning to the east to the position of Zhen and becoming mercury—thus it is said *eight returns*. Earth Four generates metal; Heaven Nine completes metal, returning to the west to the position of Dui and becoming metal—thus it is said *nine revolutions*, meaning the true body returns to truth. Heaven Five generates earth; Earth Ten completes earth, dwelling in the center and transforming into the elixir. Thus the Golden Elixir is completed not apart from the Five Phases—how could one count nine revolutions and seven returns from *yin* to *kun* and *shen*? It is originally a single taste of mercury, circulating through all the celestial stems. When the *qi* of yin and yang is full, it becomes numinous of itself—how could its entry and exit depart from the Mysterious Female?"

Ye Shibiao says: "Lead and mercury are originally one thing. Lead gives birth to mercury; mercury transforms into lead. As in the number seven of Dui—Dui is metal, and seven is the completion number of fire, meaning fire transforms into metal. Li’s number is nine—Li is fire, and nine is the completion number of metal, meaning metal transforms into fire. It circulates through the twelve celestial stems; when the *qi* of yin and yang is full, it becomes the numinous medicine, its entry and exit never departing from the Mysterious Female."

The Nameless Master says: "The *qi* of the True One congeals and becomes essence. In its first transformation, it becomes water, in the north; in its second, it becomes cinnabar, in the south; in its third, it becomes mercury, in the east; in its fourth, it becomes metal, in the west; in its fifth, it becomes the elixir, in the center. Thus the elixir is not born without heaven and earth, not produced without the sun and moon, not perfected without the four seasons, not completed without the Five Phases, not achieved without the total number. Therefore, as it traverses all the celestial stems and the numbers of yin and yang are full, it naturally attains spiritual transformation. Yet its wondrous workings and transformations never depart from the gate of the Mysterious Female—truly the root of heaven and earth."

If you wish true lead to retain mercury,
Within the palace, do not depart from the household minister.

Lord Yuan Fu says: "This speaks of the Metal Mother within the palace—nothing else will do. Lead is the lord, the mother; mercury is the minister, the child. Between wood and metal, separated by distance, there is no cause for meeting—one must rely on the Yellow Dame as matchmaker."

Lord Yuan Fu says: "Wood and metal dwell in the east and west, their ascent and descent, floating and sinking, mutually obscured. Naturally separated, there is no cause for meeting. If one wishes them to unite, the *qi* of Kan and Li must ascend and descend, and only then may they be matched. Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness; metal’s disposition yearns for wood’s benevolence. Swallowing and devouring each other, they become intimate—only then does one realize the man is pregnant."

Ye Shibiao says: "The Five Phases overcome one another and become husband and wife. Thus metal and wood swallow and devour each other, forming the numinous embryo. This is how deeply the mother and child long for each other."

Lord Yuan Fu says: "The ancient classic says, *'In sequence, it becomes human; in reversal, it becomes the elixir.'* Using the mutual overcoming of metal and wood is the natural sequence. Now, when wood meets metal, it does not fear but becomes righteous; when metal encounters wood, it does not overcome but becomes benevolent. The one who harmonizes them is truly the central *wu* and *ji*. This is like a man conceiving—an inverted meaning."

The *Dayi Zaittu* says: "In refining the Golden Elixir, without overcoming, the medicinal substances will not be subdued. Just as when a lord’s command is not strict, his ministers will rebel—thus the Five Phases overcome one another. Metal overcomes wood—this means wood returns to metal. Wood overcomes earth—this means earth returns to water. Earth overcomes water—this means water returns to earth. Water overcomes fire—this means fire returns to water."

Fire overcomes metal—this means metal returns to fire. The *Five Phases and Ten Celestial Stems* states: "Jia is the wife of Geng; Bing is the wife of Ren," and so on in like manner. Thus, overcoming signifies the harmonious union of wife and wealth.

If one refines the supreme medicine yet fails to comprehend the Five Phases, does not grasp their harmonization, remains ignorant of the lord and ministers, and misjudges weights and measures, one will squander gold and earth, vainly exhausting the power of fire.

*Who is the maiden of six and two?*
*Where dwells the youth of nine and three?*
*They call themselves wood-fluid and metal-essence,*
*Yet only with earth do the three clans unite.*

Ye Shibiao says: "The maiden of six and two is yin mercury; the youth of nine and three is yang lead. This speaks of how metal-lead and wood-mercury, when they encounter the central earth, form the three clans."

*Then, with Ding’s forging and tempering,*
*The couple at last unites in joyful embrace.*
Ye Shibiao says: "This means that the two substances, when refined by fire, only then conjoin to form the elixir."

*The river chariot dares not pause even for a moment,*
*But carries them to the summit of Kunlun Peak.*
Ye Shibiao says: "The river chariot is the water chariot. It transports the divine water, flying from behind the elbow to Kunlun."

Master Yuan Fubo says: "The river chariot is water and fire. This speaks of how the lead and mercury, when subjected to great refinement, dare not linger but return to the origin of the Great Ultimate."

The Nameless One says: "The river chariot has thirty-six single-pass *huailu* on the left and right, and thirty-six double-pass *huailu*."

The Oxherd and Weaver Girl unite in affection as their Dao converges,
The Tortoise and Snake share a bond bestowed by Nature’s decree.
Ye Shibiao says: "The Oxherd and Weaver, two celestial lodges, and the Tortoise and Snake, two creatures, occupy the same position—both are true essences of the northern direction. Like lead and mercury, originally dwelling in one place, they share a natural affinity in temperament and qi."

Master Yuan Fubo says: "The Oxherd and Weaver, circling the same celestial path each year, embody the fixed principle of Heaven’s Dao. The Tortoise and Snake, intertwined by their kindred essence, likewise partake of Nature’s inherent nature."

The Nameless One says: "The Oxherd and Weaver stars conjoin once each year; the Greater Yin and Greater Yang meet once each month. The Tortoise and Snake, too, coil in mutual embrace by kind. All these are the workings of the two qi, yin and yang. In the practice of the Golden Elixir, each step mirrors this. For the true One’s essence is formless and invisible—without the union of the twofold yin and yang’s harmonious qi, how could it descend to manifest as a grain of elixir? And once this grain of elixir is ingested, without the wondrous interplay of yin and yang’s符 fire, how could it transform into the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir?"

True Unity Master says: "Solitary yin cannot generate; lone yang cannot complete. Only through the union of the two essences, male and female, can the Way of generation and transformation arise."

When the Toad meets the New Moon, they merge in radiant embrace,
The two qi mutually sustain and revolve without cease.
Ye Shibiao says: "Sun and Moon meet at the dark and new moon, just as lead and mercury unite daily. Now, the Two Nothings revolve, never resting. As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'Between the dark and new moon, the tally is joined in the center. Primal chaos and vast obscurity—male and female follow one another. Nourishing fluids moisten and flow, circulating without end. The spirits of Heaven and Earth cannot measure its use. Concealing the body and hiding the form, it begins in the northeast, the region of Winnowing Basket and Dipper. Turning to the right, it spews forth sprouts, exudes moisture, reveals images, and scatters radiant essence.' This speaks of their union and ceaseless revolution."

All is the wondrous work of Qian and Kun—
Who can fathom such profound depths?
When yin and yang are blocked and sundered, faults arise;
How then can Heaven endure and Earth abide?

Ye Shibiao says: "The revolving union of yin and yang above is the wondrous work of Qian and Kun, yet few can comprehend it. If Heaven and Earth ceased their revolution, all would stagnate in darkness, and the myriad things would not arise. If man does not revolve, his qi becomes obstructed and stagnant, and no elixir is produced. How then could he attain the longevity of Heaven and Earth?"

Master Yuan Fubo says: "Sun and Moon meet at the dark and new moon, thus illuminating the cosmos. The two essences come and go in endless revolution—all is the wondrous work of Heaven and Earth, Qian and Kun. Who can grasp this profound mechanism? When yin and yang are blocked and fail to communicate, the myriad things cannot arise, and drought and desolation follow, the fault of accumulated yin. If man lacks the revolution of yin and yang, his qi becomes obstructed, and no elixir is produced. How then could he attain the longevity of Heaven and Earth? As the *Cantong Qi* states: 'Things without yin and yang defy Heaven and forsake the source. A hen hatching alone—her chicks will not be whole.'"

Within the male lies the essence of the female,
Embracing yin while holding fast to yang’s purity.
When these two harmonize, the medicine is complete—
Refining the po and invigorating the hun.

Ye Shibiao says: "The male containing the female is yang within yin—mercury within cinnabar. Embracing yin while holding yang is yin within yang—silver within lead. Only when lead and mercury unite is the supreme medicine formed, transmuting the body so that yin wanes and yang waxes."

The Nameless One says: "The male containing the female is the harmonious qi of the Dragon—mercury. Embracing yin while holding yang is the harmonious qi of the Tiger—lead. When these two unite, the grain of elixir is born. Ingested into the Cinnabar Field within the abdomen, it refines the yang hun to dissolve the yin po."

Trust in the Golden Elixir’s single grain:
A serpent that swallows it transforms into a dragon’s form.
A chicken that feeds upon it becomes a phoenix,
Soaring into the Azure Yang’s true realm.

The Nameless One says: "...A single grain, like a millet seed—when serpent or chicken swallows it, they instantly transform into dragon or phoenix. Such is the sacred power of the elixir."

Only when Heaven and Earth pass through closure and opening
Must one discern, at dawn and dusk, the signs of Layering and Sprouting.

As spokes converge upon the hub and rivers flow toward the sea,
The marvel lies in drawing forth and adding—mastering their motion.

Master Yuan Gongfu says: This speaks of the Two Nothings intermingling, like Heaven and Earth passing through closure and opening, thus giving birth to the myriad things. Dawn as *Zhun* and dusk as *Meng* mark the head of the sixty hexagrams’ fire symbols—each must be closely discerned. If one grasps the method, the Golden Elixir is not difficult to achieve, just as spokes gather at the hub and waters flow to the sea; the marvel lies in the art of drawing out and adding, in their cyclical motion.

The Nameless One says: The firing process begins with *Zhun* and *Meng*, and the work rests at *Pi* and *Tai*. Day and night, one revolves the symbolic fire, returning it to the crucible—like a wheel’s spokes converging at the hub, or the hundred streams flowing to the sea. In such drawing forth and adding, the wondrous transformation unfolds.

Attain the One, and all ten thousand things are complete—
No need to divide East, West, South, or North.
Reduce again and again, guarding past merit;
The treasure of life must not be lightly toyed with.

Master Ye Shibiao says: "Attain the One"—this is the Supreme Unity containing the true. When the true is embodied in the elixir, the Four Symbols are no longer needed. Shed worldly affairs day by day, ever vigilant; the slightest lapse may forfeit prior merit. This treasure of nurturing life must not be lightly handled.

Master Yuan Gongfu says: Laozi said, "Attain the One, and all things are complete." He also said, "Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; valleys attain the One and become full; humans attain the One and become numinous." If one has attained the One, why trouble with East, West, South, or North? Reduce again and again, lest past merit be wasted and future calamity incurred—this treasure of life must not be lightly toyed with.

The Nameless One says: The One arises from the greatness of yin and yang, taking form. Once attained and swallowed into the five viscera, one must continue the firing process as before to consolidate prior merit, thereby fully realizing the Dao. Do not act recklessly, lest the precious pearl be lost.

At Winter Solstice, the yang returns with a single line;
Each thirty days, another yang line is added.
Within the month, the *Fu* hexagram appears at dawn,
And by the full moon’s end, the *Qian* hexagram concludes with the sign of *Shou*’s conception.
The day, too, divides into cold and heat—
Yang revives at midnight’s hour,
While at noon, the *Shou* hexagram’s first yin line emerges.
In refining the medicine, one must know dawn and dusk.

Master Ye Shibiao says: There is the Winter Solstice of the year, the Winter Solstice of the month, and the Winter Solstice of the day. Here, the Winter Solstice of the day is used, aligning human measure with celestial measure, applying daily practice to yearly work. As the earlier verse says, "Replacing days with hours refines the divine work."

Master Zhen Yizi says: The year aligns with the month, the month with the day, the day with the hour. The *Cantong Qi* states: "Should one seal the tongue and wither in silence, cutting off the Dao invites punishment; inscribing feelings on bamboo and silk risks leaking Heaven’s tally."

The Nameless One says: From the Winter Solstice, when a single yang returns, every thirty days adds another yang line, until the six yang lines form the *Qian* hexagram—this is the season of yang fire. When yang reaches its peak, yin arises; thus, from the Summer Solstice, when a single yin is born, every thirty days adds another yin line, until the six yin lines form the *Kun* hexagram—this is the season of yin tally. When yin reaches its peak, yang revives, cycling endlessly—this is the yearly progression of fire and tally.

The sage then condenses this yearly cycle into a single month: on the new moon, the *Fu* hexagram appears; each two and a half days correspond to thirty days, so by the full moon, the pure yang *Qian* hexagram is complete. On the sixteenth day, the *Shou* hexagram’s first yin line emerges—hence, "by the full moon’s end, the *Qian* hexagram concludes with the sign of *Shou*’s conception." The first stirrings of yin qi are called the "sign." This is the celestial revolution within a month.

Further, the monthly cycle is compressed into a single day, dividing the qi of cold, heat, warmth, and frost into the four seasons. Thus, at midnight, the *Zi* hour, when a single yang revives, the *Fu* hexagram appears; at noon, the *Wu* hour, when a single yin arises, the *Gou* hexagram appears. In applying the symbolic fire—drawing forth, adding, advancing, and retreating—one must align perfectly with Heaven and Earth’s four seasons and yin-yang’s ascent and descent, without the slightest deviation. Hence, "in refining the medicine, one must know dawn and dusk"—this is the celestial revolution within a day.

Virtue cultivated surpasses eight hundred;
Hidden merits accumulated fill three thousand.

To equalize self and others, kin and foe—
this fulfills the original vow of divine immortals.
Tigers, rhinos, blades cannot harm;
the inconstant fire-house cannot bind.
Once the sacred talisman descends, ascend to Heaven,
steadily riding the simurgh’s chariot and phoenix’s palanquin.

Master Yuan the Assistant says: Among the divine immortals of old, none attained ascension without cultivating hidden merits. The essence lies in equalizing self and others, releasing both kin and grudges—this is the immutable aspiration of immortals. After the elixir is perfected and virtue is complete, one receives the talisman and register, verified by simurgh’s shadow and phoenix’s trace. How could tigers, rhinos, blades, or the inconstant fire-house ever harm or ensnare?

Laozi says: "Traveling by land, one does not avoid rhinos or tigers; entering battle, one does not shun armor or blades—why? Because there is no realm of death." *The Kinship of the Three* states: "The enlightened grasp its meaning, suddenly knowing the path. Diligently practice it, day and night without slack, and after three years of ingesting the medicine, you will lightly ascend and wander afar. Step through fire without scorching, enter water without wetting. You may appear or vanish at will, ever joyful and free from care. When the Dao is accomplished and virtue complete, conceal yourself and await the hour. The Great One will summon you, relocating you to the Central Isle. When merits are fulfilled, ascend above, responding to the register and receiving the chart."

Twelve
If one cannot distinguish the Five Phases and Four Images,
how can one discern cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver?

Before hearing the firing times of the elixir’s refinement, one already claims the name of reclusion.
Unwilling to reflect on one’s own errors, one further teaches others the wrong path.
Awaiting their eternal perdition in the sea of delusion—how can such heartless deception be borne?
Master Yuan Fuxu says: Among today’s Dao-seekers, some do not know what the Five Phases and Four Images are, nor what lead, mercury, or cinnabar may be. Even if they can distinguish them, they remain ignorant of the principle of firing times. Yet they readily assume the name of reclusion, haughtily complacent, believing none surpass them. These are still the better sort. Others, having received gold and silk, recklessly transmit minor arts of side gates, mistaking them for the supreme, most authentic Dao. If the heart may be deceived, can Heaven be deceived? Such is not the Way of the Great Dao. How can one not tremble?

Moreover—
The elixir is the supreme treasure of the colored body; when refined, its transformations are boundless.
Further, if one investigates the true on the plane of nature, one grasps the wondrous function of non-arising.
Without awaiting another body in a future life, one attains before one’s eyes the divine powers of the Buddha.
Ever since the Dragon Girl achieved this merit, who since has followed in her footsteps?
Ye Shibiao says: The golden elixir already enables numinous transformation. If one wishes, with this wondrous, colored body of the golden elixir, to realize the true golden form of compassion, majestic and resplendent, to become the teacher of gods and humans, to display divine powers, to universally observe the Dharma realm, to move the unimpeded great compassion of equal mind, to adorn the Buddha-land, to broadly proclaim the wondrous Dharma, and to universally deliver sentient beings—then one must also, in addition, recognize the mind and see the nature to travel this path. The Dragon Girl’s sudden awakening to the mind-jewel and immediate attainment of Buddhahood—this is that method. If a practitioner, disdaining the initial steps, cannot refine the golden elixir but instead seeks directly the true emptiness of the Tathāgata, serene and ever quiescent—this is the ultimate nirvāṇa samādhi. Yet this body, these words, are not what is to be taken up.

*Reading the* Zhouyi Cantong Qi:
The wondrous function of the great elixir follows Qian and Kun.
Qian and Kun move, and the Five Phases divide.
When the Five Phases proceed, the common Dao has life and death.
When the Five Phases reverse, the elixir’s body is ever numinous, ever enduring.
Yang governs life, yin governs death—one life, one death, one departure, one return.
This is the natural principle of the common Dao’s sequence.
The sage takes this as model, reverses yin and yang, and applies creation in reverse.
Establishing Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel, he steals the primordial unity of qi to make the elixir.
With the elixir, he refines the form, entering the original form, merging with the Dao in obscurity.
The Dao is fundamentally without limit; how can immortality have an end?

From the void, signs of substance arise; the Two Modes are firmly rooted in the One.
The Four Images do not depart; the two bodies and eight trigrams mutually beget one another.
Myriad images arise from change and movement; good fortune, misfortune, regret, and remorse are here distinguished.
The common people use it daily yet do not know; the sage can investigate its root and source.
Gazing upon the wondrousness of the *Yi*’s Dao, he exhausts the principles of Qian and Kun, thus entrusting images to this text.
When Pi and Tai interact, yin and yang now ascend, now descend.
When Zhun and Meng act, movement and stillness are at dawn and dusk.
Kan and Li are male and female, water and fire; Zhen and Dui are dragon and tiger, po and hun.
Guarding the center, the yellow skirt is supremely auspicious; encountering Kang, one is without position yet honored.
Having not yet carefully observed the beginning and end of the myriad things, one further illuminates the return and flight of the two qi.
The moon’s waxing and waning correspond to the flourishing and decline of essence and spirit.
The sun’s rising and setting command the cold and warmth of construction and defense.
On the day of the winter solstice, beneath the earth, a single yang qi ascends—this is the Fu hexagram. The human primordial qi is likewise; thus, one advances the yang fire.
By the first month, the qi of yin and yang are evenly matched, naturally intermingling—this is the Tai hexagram. The human primordial qi is likewise; thus, “When Pi and Tai interact, yin and yang now ascend, now descend.”
The sage gathers this year’s qi-cycles into a single month of thirty days, calculating two and a half days as thirty periods to correspond to one month.
Thus, from the first day of the month, following the light of the great yang, its initial sprouting is the Fu hexagram in action.
By the first quarter, the eighth day, the moon is half bright; water and metal are evenly divided—this is the Tai hexagram in action.
After the sixteenth day, the moon gradually wanes—this is the Pi hexagram in action.
By the last quarter, the twenty-third day, the moon is half dark; metal and water are evenly divided—this is the Pi hexagram in action.
Thus, “The moon’s waxing and waning correspond to the flourishing and decline of essence and spirit.”
Further, he transfers this month’s qi-cycles into a single day of twelve periods.
At the zi hour, one yang arises; thus, in the human kidneys, a single yang of pure essence qi ascends—advancing the yang fire, this is the Fu hexagram.
At the wu hour, one yin arises; thus, in the human heart, a single yin of numinous spirit qi descends—advancing the yin tally, this is the Gou hexagram.
Thus, “Fu and Pi illuminate the return and flight of the two qi.”
At the zi hour, one begins the yang fire; zi is the first of the six yang, thus it is dawn, with the Zhun hexagram in charge.
At the wu hour, one begins the yin tally; wu is the origin of the six yin, thus it is dusk, with the Meng hexagram in charge.
Thus, “When Zhun and Meng act, movement and stillness are at dawn and dusk.”
One day and night, two hexagrams are in charge; thirty days account for sixty hexagrams.
Zhun and Meng are the beginning of the sixty hexagrams; Ji Ji is the end of the sixty hexagrams.
Ending and then beginning again, beginning and then ending again—thus, “Having not yet carefully observed the beginning and end of the myriad things.”
In refining the golden elixir, one first establishes the true yin and true yang as the furnace and crucible, then entices the Supreme Ultimate’s one qi to become the elixir.
If the Supreme Ultimate’s qi is not enticed by the true yin and true yang, it cannot descend in numinosity and form an image.
Thus, the *Cantong Qi* establishes the two hexagrams Qian and Kun as the furnace and crucible, divides Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, places them in the central palace, and distributes the remaining hexagrams throughout the thirty days of the month to operate the tally and fire.
Therefore, Qian and Kun are the dragon and tiger.

Zhen and Dui are husband and wife, hun and po.
Kan and Li are lead and mercury, water and fire, male and female, emotion and nature. Extending this by analogy, the variations become boundless.
Yet when one seeks the most fitting expression, nothing surpasses the metaphor of true yin and true yang as these two substances.
By uniting these two within the Yellow Path’s chamber at the central palace, the elixir is formed.
Thus it is said: “Abiding in the center, the yellow skirt brings supreme fortune.”
Once the elixir is ingested, without true fire the sacred embryo cannot be nurtured. Therefore, one mobilizes the primordial yang’s qi as fire. Fire has no fixed position but circulates through the six voids—hence it is said: “When encountering Kang, it has no position yet is revered.”
As the sun rises, it is day; as it sets, it is night. The sage moves the tally and fire within a single day and night, dividing and apportioning the qi of yin and yang, cold and heat, externally aligning with the celestial tally, internally harmonizing with the constructive and protective [qi]. This regulates the entire body, drawing and adding, operating and employing, warming and nourishing the elixir’s form.
Thus it is said: “The sun’s rising and setting harmonize with the constructive and protective [qi]’s cold and warmth.”
Heaven’s one generates water, which in humans is called essence.
Earth’s two generates fire, which in humans is called spirit.
The human’s essence and spirit, constructive and protective [qi], should circulate unceasingly in accord with heaven and earth’s yin and yang, the four seasons, and the five phases.
Words are established to clarify images; once the image is grasped, words are forgotten.
Just as images are set forth to point to meaning, once the meaning is realized, the image is discarded.
The enlightened find it ever simple and easy; the deluded grow ever more confused and entangled.
Thus the adept who cultivates the truth, when reading the *Cantong Qi*, does not cling to images or adhere to text.
All the above are Master Wei’s exposition of the Golden Elixir’s Way—most simple, most easy—revealing its secret essentials. Thus he borrows the hexagrams of the *Yijing*, embedding meaning within words to enable learners to awaken to their intent and comprehend their expression.
If one attains the Golden Elixir’s secret essentials, then Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, Zhen and Dui, dragon and tiger, emotion and nature, hun and po, lead and mercury, water and fire, and the like may all be set aside.
If one clearly understands the true mechanism of firing, then the hexagrams Zhun and Meng, Jiwei, Fu and Gou, Pi and Tai, their images and lines, their weights and measures, may all be rendered useless.
This immortal elder, fearing that learners reading the *Cantong Qi* would fail to grasp the true master’s intent—merely clinging to cold images and rigid text without understanding the meaning of discarding images and forgetting words—thus composed this to instruct his disciples. Such is his benevolence in aiding all beings.
Yet even so, without the oral transmission from a perfected one’s mouth, it is still not easy to tread even a fraction of the pot’s profound depths.
*Awakening to Reality*, Scroll Twenty-Nine of the *Ten Books on Cultivating the Truth*, concludes.

**Awakening to Reality, Scroll Thirty of the *Ten Books on Cultivating the Truth*: Chan Hymns and Eulogies**

Those who study the Dao yet fail to comprehend the principle of inherent nature while solely cultivating the Golden Elixir—such a path, lacking the unity of nature and life, leaves the mind’s reach incomplete, making it difficult to harmonize self and other. How then can one attain ultimate perfection and transcend the Three Realms?

Thus the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: There are ten kinds of immortals, all of whom refine the mind to firmness and purity within the human realm, living for thousands or tens of thousands of years. Yet if they do not cultivate the samādhi of true awakening, when their karmic reward is exhausted, they will scatter into the various destinies.

Hence Maitreya Bodhisattva’s *Verses on the Diamond Sūtra* declares:
*Though you endure for a hundred thousand kalpas,*
*In the end, you still fall into emptiness and extinction.*

Therefore, in this *Awakening to Reality*, the method first employs the teachings of immortals and the transformations of life to guide cultivation, then expands spiritual penetration through the wondrous functions of all buddhas, and finally dispels illusory delusion through the awakened nature of Suchness, returning to the ultimate source of quiescent emptiness.

**Verses on the Ground of Nature**

**I**
Buddha-nature is neither same nor different;
A thousand lamps share one light.
Add to it—how could it overflow?
Diminish it—yet no harm is done.
Seizing or rejecting are both errors,
Burning or drowning—no hindrance at all.
The dharmas of seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving—
Not one can be fathomed.

**II**
The Tathāgata’s wondrous body pervades as many grains as the Ganges’ sands,
The myriad forms and phenomena offer no obstruction.
When one attains the true Dharma-eye of perfect penetration,
Only then does one know the Three Realms are one’s own home.

**III**
Look for it—yet its form cannot be seen;
Call to it—and it responds in turn.
Do not say this sound is like an echo in a valley,
For if there were no valley, what sound would there be?

**IV**
One thing contains hearing, seeing, knowing, and perceiving,
For it is through all sense-realms that its mechanism is revealed.
Even this single, wondrous thing is not truly existent—
On what then do the four depend?

**V**
Without moving a single step, one arrives at the Western Heaven;
Sitting upright, all directions appear before one’s eyes.
The light behind the neck is still but illusion,
Clouds arising beneath the feet—yet not yet an immortal.

**VI**
Seeking birth—yet birth itself is unborn;
Fearing extinction—yet extinction never abides even for a moment.
Eyes’ seeing is not like ears’ hearing;
Mouth’s speech cannot compare to the nose’s discernment.

**No Merit or Demerit**
All day long walking—yet never having walked;
All day long sitting—yet never having sat.
Cultivating good yet not accruing merit,
Committing evil yet bearing no sin.
If people have not yet awakened to the mind,
Do not cling to these words and act recklessly.
After death, you must face Yama,
And escape not the cauldrons, pestles, and grinding wheels.

**The Three Realms Are Only Mind**
The Three Realms are the wondrous principle of mind alone;
The myriad things are neither this nor that.
Not one thing is not my mind,
Not one thing is my self.
**Seeing Things, One Sees the Mind**
At the sight of things, one sees the mind;
Without things, the mind does not appear.
Throughout the ten directions, within the blocked and the open,
The true mind is all-pervading.
If discriminating knowledge arises,
It becomes inverted perception.
When encountering objects without engaging the mind,
Only then does one see the face of bodhi.

**Perfect Penetration**
Having seen true emptiness—emptiness is not empty;
Where is there no perfect clarity and penetration?
Root, dust, mind, and dharma—all are without substance;
Only through wondrous function does one know their unity with things.

**Following It**
The myriad things lie horizontally before one’s eyes,
Following their movement or stillness, letting them clamor as they will.
Perfect clarity, concentration, and wisdom remain unstained,
Like a lotus born from water—pure and dry of itself.

**Jeweled Moon**
A bright moon hangs in the empty sky,
Its clear light unhindered across ten thousand lands.
Gather it—yet it does not assemble;
Push it away—yet it cannot be parted.
Advance it—yet it does not proceed;
Retreat it—yet it does not recede.
That is not distant, this is not near;
Externally it is not manifest, internally it is not concealed.
Same within difference, different within sameness—
Tell me, puppet, do you understand?

**Verses on the *Heart Sūtra***
The aggregates, truths, faculties, and dusts—form and emptiness—
All are without a single dharma that can be spoken.
Inverted views are now exhausted,
The quiescent essence shines alone.

**Self and Other**
I am not different from others,
Yet others’ minds differ from mine.
Others have near and far,
I have no this or that.
On land and water, flying and walking—
All are viewed as one body.
Noble and base, honored and humble—
Head and feet are the same as myself.
I am not even myself—
How then could there be you?
When both self and other are nonexistent,
All bubbles return to water.

**Reading the *Ancestral Teachings Collection* of Chan Master Xuedou**

The one stream of Caoqi divides into a thousand tributaries,
Illuminating past and present without obstruction.
Yet recent scholars do not trace the source,
Mistaking a hoofprint’s puddle for the vast ocean.

Master Xuedou, teacher of the profound,
Rumbled like thunder, striking the Dharma drum.
The lion-king roars forth from its den,
And the hundred beasts and thousand demons all tremble in fear.

Some sing poems, some speak verses,
Diligently pointing out the path for the lost.
Their words are resplendent, their meaning lofty and deep,
Striking jade and ringing gold—echoing through the ages.

Alas, the deluded cling to appearances,
Chasing after words and seeking names and numbers.
The true Suchness and real mark are fundamentally wordless,
Without high or low, without edges or bounds.
Neither form nor emptiness, nor a dual body—
The ten directions’ dust and lands are one perfect wheel.
True concentration is never divided by speech or silence,
Neither grasped nor abandoned.
Simply not clinging to any appearances in the mind—
This is the true rule of the Tathāgata.

To dispel delusion, the real is set against it,
Yet if delusion does not arise, the real also dims.
Only when one knows that both real and delusion are not two
Does the true mind become unimpeded.

Without obstruction, one attains freedom;
A single awakening instantly dissolves eons of karmic transgressions.
Without exerting effort, one realizes bodhi,
Henceforth forever leaving the sea of birth and death.

My teacher’s recent words flow smoothly,
Left in the world as a model.
Last night, I summoned him before me,
Pierced his nostrils and hung him on a staff.
Asking him about the foremost meaning,
He replied, “Any words spoken are all slander.”

**On the Precepts, Concentration, and Wisdom**

The precepts, concentration, and wisdom are the wondrous functions within the Dharma. Though the buddhas and ancestors have spoken of them, those who do not comprehend may cling to their words. Here, I briefly expound them to aid awakening.

When mind and environment are both forgotten, and not a single thought stirs—this is the precepts.
When the awakened nature is perfectly clear, and inner and outer are luminously transparent—this is concentration.
When responding to conditions, the wondrous function is inexhaustible—this is wisdom.
These three depend upon one another to be complete, mutually serving as substance and function. If the precepts are taken as substance, then concentration and wisdom are their function. If concentration is taken as substance, then the precepts and wisdom are its function. If wisdom is taken as substance, then the precepts and concentration are its function.

The three are never for even a moment separate—just as the sun relies on its light to illuminate, and light relies on illumination to be bright. Without light, there cannot be illumination; without illumination, there cannot be brightness. Tracing back to the origin of precepts, concentration, and wisdom, they arise from a single nature. Light, illumination, and brightness arise from a single sun—yet even this "one" is not truly one, so how can there be three?

When the three and the one are both forgotten, clarity and purity abide.
*Verse: "Mind is Buddha"*
The Buddha is mind, mind is Buddha—both have always been illusory things.
Only when you know there is no Buddha and no mind do you realize the true Dharmakāya Buddha.

The Dharmakāya Buddha has no form,
a single sphere of radiance containing all phenomena.
The formless form is the true form,
the signless sign is the true mark.
Neither form nor emptiness, yet not non-emptiness,
neither moving nor still, neither coming nor going.
Neither different nor identical, neither existent nor non-existent,
neither graspable nor rejectable, neither audible nor visible.
Within and without, perfectly interpenetrating, everywhere unobstructed—
a single Buddha-land exists within a grain of sand.
A single grain of sand contains the great trichiliocosm,
one body and mind are identical to ten thousand.

To know this, you must master the Dharma of no-mind,
untainted and unobstructed—this is pure karma.
With myriad good and evil deeds, yet nothing is done—
this is the true refuge of Namo and Mahākāśyapa.

*Song of the Pearl*
A poor man’s garment holds a pearl,
naturally perfect and luminous.
Not knowing to seek it within,
he counts the treasures of others.
Counting others’ treasures brings no benefit,
only teaching you to waste effort in vain.
How much better to recognize your own jewel,
worth countless millions in gold.

This precious pearl radiates the greatest light,
illuminating the three-thousandfold great thousand worlds,
never diminishing in the slightest.
Yet it is obscured by floating clouds—
once you recognize this cintāmaṇi,
who would still cherish bubbles, emptiness, or flowers?
The Buddha’s pearl and my pearl are the same,
my nature returns to the ocean of Buddha-nature.

Pearl is not pearl, ocean is not ocean—
serene, the mind’s capacity embraces the Dharma-realm.
Let dust and clamor fill your eyes,
with perfect concentration and wisdom, you remain ever at ease.
Neither emptiness nor form,
within and without, resplendent and unobstructed.
The six supernatural powers and boundless wisdom,
self-benefit and benefiting others—how could they be exhausted?

Seeing is completion, all affairs are finished—
abandon learning, be without action, and pass the days.
If you fear the white blade of the knife as if you’ve never cultivated the truth,
the mind of truth and illusion is still bound to dust.
All dharmas have always been signless—
within the signless, the Dharmakāya exists.
The Dharmakāya is the natural, true Buddha,
neither human nor thing,
vastly filling the space between heaven and earth.
It is merely subtle and indistinct, elusive and vague.

Dirt does not stain, light shines of itself.
No dharma arises that is not born from the mind;
if the mind does not arise, dharmas naturally cease.
Thus know that sin and blessing originally have no form.

No Buddha to cultivate, no Dharma to expound—
a true person’s wisdom and insight are naturally distinct.
Speaking, they roar like a lion,
not like a wild ox debating birth and extinction.

*Song of Chan Meditation to Dispel Delusion*
The Tathāgata’s Chan nature is like water—
when the body is still, wind and waves cease of themselves.
In movement and rest, profoundly clear and constant,
not only during seated meditation is this so.

People today seek realization through still sitting,
not knowing it lies entirely in seeing one’s nature.
If nature is bright within seeing,
seeing turns to stillness within nature.
When stillness is perfected, wisdom’s function is boundless—
this is called the supernatural powers of all Buddhas.

If you wish to investigate its substance and function,
you will see only the emptiness of the ten directions.
Within emptiness, nothing exists,
nor is there anything subtle or indistinct.
Since the subtle and indistinct cannot be sought,
seeking them leads to deviation.

Yet these two words—"deviation"—
cannot be grasped as evidence.
The original mind is like space itself—
how could there be gain or loss, subject or object?

Simply cast aside all dharmas,
eliminate them until nothing remains.
Suddenly, perfect clarity manifests of itself—
then you are no different from the Buddhas.

The physical body is my temporary lodging,
so blend with the world’s radiance and mingle with the俗.
In all actions, be without mind—
why quarrel over right and wrong, honor and disgrace?

This life is but a temporary abode,
the innkeeper is called Vairocana.
Vairocana neither comes nor goes—
thus know that birth and extinction leave no trace.

If asked what Vairocana is like,
it is simply that which has no form.
Before your eyes, every leaf and speck of dust—
dust and leaves are neither the same nor different.

Moreover, each speck of dust, each leaf,
is Śākyamuni and Mahākāśyapa.
If different, the myriad sounds all resound;
if the same, a single wind gathers all.

If you wish to recognize the cintāmaṇi,
do not say you must attain the Dharma to know it.
When sick, use medicine to cure it—
once the illness is gone, what use is medicine?

When the mind is deluded, rely on the Dharma for illumination;
when the mind is awakened, the Dharma is no longer needed.
Like a tarnished mirror polished—
blemishes

If you see me speak of emptiness,
it is like a barbarian gulping down jujubes whole—
this Dharma only Buddhas can fathom,
how could the foolish and dull grasp its signs?

Then there are those who claim to cultivate Chan,
merely learning to spar with words and seal their lips.
They boast of my swift questions and answers,
yet know not the true host within.
They but pluck branches and gather leaves,
unable to trace the root to its source.
With the root, branches and leaves flourish;
without the root, branches and leaves cannot endure.

Though they flaunt their grasp of the luminous pearl,
they remain entangled in self and other.
From the wondrous awakening of my spirit-source,
they stand worlds apart.
Pitiable and laughable are these folk,
who spend years speaking of the Dao in vain.
Too proud to seek guidance,
they waste their lives in futility.

Such are the dull and deluded,
whose heavy karmic obstructions stem from perverse views.
If they fail to awaken in this life,
how will they escape drowning in the next?

*Song of the Unmindful*

A laughable heart is mine—
stubborn, coarse,
drifting, carefree,
letting things be as they are.

I neither cultivate practice
nor commit transgressions,
neither benefit others
nor hoard for myself.

I keep no precepts,
observe no taboos,
know not rites nor music,
practice no benevolence nor righteousness.

Ask what I can do—
I am versed in nothing.
Hungry, I eat;
thirsty, I drink.

Weary, I sleep;
awake, I walk.
Hot, I wear light clothes;
cold, I cover myself.

No thoughts, no measure,
what sorrow, what joy?
No regret, no scheming,
no念, no intent.

All life’s glory and shame—
but an inn I pass through.
Like birds roosting in trees,
so too may I be compared.

Coming, I do not forbid;
going, I do not halt.
I neither shun nor seek,
neither praise nor blame.

I do not loathe the foul,
nor covet the fair.
I neither seek quiet chambers
nor flee the bustling market.

I speak no ill of others,
nor boast of my own rightness.
I neither exalt the honored
nor slight the lowly.

Loved ones and foes,
great and small, inner and outer—
all alike in gain and loss,
reverence and scorn, peril and ease.

My heart holds no dual vision,
but rests in even clarity.
I neither precede fortune
nor initiate misfortune.

Responding only to stimuli, moving only under compulsion,
I fear not blades nor dread tigers and rhinos.
Adapting to things as they are called,
why cling to names and forms?

The eye does not chase after sights,
sounds do not come to the ear.
All appearances that arise
are but delusion and falsehood.
Male and female, form and voice—
none possess a fixed essence.

Form and appearance are without mind,
unstained and unobstructed,
free and at ease,
nothing can burden them.
Wondrous awareness shines perfectly,
illuminating inner and outer,
encompassing the six directions,
without near or far.

Its light—neither light nor not-light—
like the moon in water,
difficult to grasp or discard,
what comparison could suffice?
To realize this wondrous function
is to transcend all bounds.

Should one ask its essence,
this alone is it.

**West River Moon**

**I**
Deluded thoughts need not be forcibly extinguished,
truth requires no desperate seeking.
The original source and self-nature are equally cultivated as Buddha;
delusion and awakening are not bound by before or after.
Awakened, one becomes Buddha in an instant;
deluded, one drifts for ten thousand kalpas.
If but a single thought aligns with true cultivation,
the dust of countless sins is wiped away.

**II**
Originally without birth or death,
yet forced into distinctions of birth and death.
Even sin and fortune have no root—
how could the wondrous essence ever increase or diminish?
I possess a bright mirror,
long obscured by dust.
Today, polished to brilliance, it illumines heaven and earth;
all phenomena stand revealed, nothing hidden.

**III**
My nature enters the nature of all Buddhas,
and the nature of Buddhas everywhere is the same.
Like the cold moon’s reflection in a cold spring,
one moon appears in a thousand pools.
Small as a hair’s tip, beyond perception;
vast, it fills the three thousand worlds.
High or low, it naturally fits square and round—
why speak of short or long, deep or shallow?

**IV**
Dharma, dharma—there is no dharma;
emptiness, emptiness—yet not emptiness.
Stillness and clamor, speech and silence are fundamentally the same;
why labor to interpret dreams within dreams?
In use, there is no use;
in effortless effort, function arises.
Like fruit ripening naturally red,
ask not how it was cultivated.

**V**
Good and evil arise in fleeting thoughts,
glory and decay are of no concern.
Darkness and light, hidden and revealed—let them drift as they will;
eat when hungry, drink when thirsty.
The spirit abides in serene stillness,
yet singing and chanting cause no harm.
A pool of autumn water remains deep and clear—
when wind stirs, do not fear all is lost.

**VI**
Do not forcefully suppress sensory objects;
provisional names are but expedient means for bodhi.
Form and emptiness, brightness and darkness are fundamentally equal;
do not divide truth and delusion into two.
Awakened, this very place is the Pure Land;
there is no need for India or Caoqi.
Who says the Land of Ultimate Bliss lies in the western heavens?
When realized, Amitābha manifests in the world.

**VII**
Self, others, kings, and the long-lived—
why distinguish high and low?
The Dharmakāya pervades all, leaving none outside;
thought after thought, no need to seek.
Seeing—has it ever truly seen?
Hearing—is it not also unhearing?
All functions have never known one another;
who can obstruct you in birth and death?

**VIII**
To practice giving while attached to form
brings rewards no higher than gods and humans.
Like shooting an arrow upward at floating clouds,
it falls only when its force is spent.
How much better to embody the true mark of non-action,
returning to the source, reverting to simplicity and purity.
Forgetting objects, exhausting passions, follow nature’s truth—
thus attaining the patience of the unborn.

**IX**
If fish and hare come into hand,
the snare and trap are naturally forgotten.
The raft for crossing the river, the ladder for ascending the sky—
once arrived, all are discarded.
Before awakening, one relies on words;
after awakening, words become false.
Though these four lines belong to non-action,
they too must be transcended.

**X**
Awakened, do not seek extinction;
follow conditions and guide the lost.
Views of permanence and annihilation, carrying burdens—
all are expedient means pointing to reality.
The five eyes, three bodies, four wisdoms,
six perfections, and ten thousand practices—
all are perfected in a single radiant pearl,
benefiting others while aiding oneself.

**XI**
I see people today discuss nature,
merely boasting and hastening to respond.
When encountering circumstances, they become deluded—
how do they differ from fools?
To speak is to act accordingly;
only then is there no flaw in word or deed.
Wielding the sword of wisdom to cut the pearl—
this is called the Tathāgata’s true wisdom.

**XII**
To realize the wondrous Dao of the unborn,
nothing surpasses seeing one’s true mind.
The true body is without form or sound;
the pure Dharmakāya alone remains.
This Dao is neither non-existent nor existent,
nor is it to be sought in the middle.
Abandoning both extremes and the center—
seeing this is called the highest attainment.

---

**Postscript**
Consider that human life arises from deluded emotions,
and with a body comes suffering.
If there were no body, from where would suffering arise?
To escape suffering,
nothing surpasses embodying the supreme Dao.
To embody the supreme Dao,
nothing surpasses illuminating the original mind.

Thus, the mind is the essence of the Dao,
and the Dao is the function of the mind.
If one can examine the mind and observe nature,
the perfect and luminous essence naturally manifests,
the function of non-action naturally arises,
without need for effort, instantly transcending to the other shore.
If not for the mind-mirror shining clearly,
the spirit-pearl radiant and vast,
how could all appearances instantly depart,
the finest dust remain unstained,
the mind-source be free,
and the unborn be decisively realized?

Yet those who illuminate the mind and embody the Dao
are not burdened by the body,
nor disturbed by circumstances.
How then could blades or weapons harm them,
tigers or rhinos endanger them,
great fires or floods cause concern?
The enlightened one’s mind is like a bright mirror,
reflecting without grasping,
responding to conditions without contention,
thus holding all things without harm.
This is the wondrous Dao of the supreme truth.

Its essence is originally nameless,
yet the sage forcibly names it.
Originally wordless,
yet the sage forcibly speaks.
If names and words were silenced,
later generations would have no means to recognize its essence and return to truth.
Thus, the sage establishes teachings and sets forth words
to reveal the Dao.
Therefore, the Dao is made manifest through words,
and words, through the Dao, return to forgetfulness.

Alas, this Dao is most wondrous and subtle,
yet the world’s people, dull in root and nature,
cling to the notion of a self, loathe death, and delight in life,
making ultimate awakening difficult to attain.

The Yellow Emperor and Laozi, lamenting humanity’s greed and attachment, employed the arts of life-cultivation to accommodate their desires and guide them gradually. As the essence of life-cultivation lies in the Golden Elixir, and the essence of the Golden Elixir resides in the divine water and flowery pond, the teachings of the *Dao De Jing* and *Yin Fu Jing* thus flourished in the world, benefiting those who delight in life. Yet their words are veiled and their principles profound; though scholars recite their texts, none grasp their meaning. Without encountering a perfected master to transmit oral instructions, even after a hundred conjectures, one can never achieve its efficacy or accomplish its work. Is this not why, though learners are as numerous as ox hairs, those who attain realization are as rare as unicorn horns?

In the *jiyou* year, Boduan met his teacher in Chengdu and received the elixir method. That very year, his patron passed away, and thereafter, each of the three times he transmitted the teaching to others, misfortune struck within two weeks. Only recently did he recall his teacher’s admonition: *"One day, if someone comes to loosen your bonds and break your fetters, you may transmit it to them—no others."* Later, wishing to dissolve his name from the registers but fearing that practitioners of this Dao would not trust him, he composed this *Awakening to Reality*, expounding the origins and ends of the elixir and cinnabar.

Once completed, seekers flocked to him. Observing their earnestness and finding their minds not overly skeptical, he selected some to instruct. Yet those he taught were neither men of great power nor strength, capable of rescuing the imperiled or saving the drowning, nor were they magnanimous, resolute, benevolent, or enlightened. After the first or second transmission, he remained unaware of the consequences—only after the third did he reflect on past errors. Thus he realized that the Great Elixir’s method is utterly simple and easy; even the dullest and most ignorant, if they practice it, may instantly ascend to sagehood. For this reason, Heaven guards it in secrecy, forbidding its careless transmission to the unworthy.

Yet Boduan, disregarding his teacher’s words, repeatedly divulged Heaven’s mysteries. Because he possessed a body, he repeatedly suffered Heaven’s reproofs and calamities—so swift and divine was its warning that he dared not but tremble in fear and reproach himself. From this day forward, he shall seal his lips and bind his tongue; though cauldrons and traps stand before him, or blades press upon his neck, he shall never speak of it again.

Within this *Awakening to Reality*, the verses and odes on the Great Elixir, its medicinal substances, and the subtleties of firing times are all exhaustively set forth. Those of good karmic affinity, possessing the bones of immortality, upon reading it, will find their wisdom and discernment naturally clarified, enabling them to follow the text and comprehend its meaning—what need is there for Boduan’s humble oral transmission? This is Heaven’s gift, not Boduan’s willful dissemination.

As for the songs and praises at the end of the work, they expound the method of seeing one’s nature—this is the very Dao of wondrous awakening through non-action mentioned above. Yet the Dao of non-action takes the equalization of things as its heart; though it reveals its secret essentials, it ultimately incurs no fault. Alas, ordinary beings bear karmic obstructions of varying thickness, and their natures differ in sharpness and dullness. Though they hear the same sound, their interpretations diverge. Thus, though the Dharma treasures expounded by Śākyamuni and Mañjuśrī are none other than the One Vehicle, listeners, according to their capacities, naturally form the distinctions of the Three Vehicles. Hereafter, if there are those of keen and resolute nature who encounter this work, they will recognize that Boduan has grasped the supreme essence of the One Vehicle as transmitted by Bodhidharma and the Sixth Patriarch, and may awaken to the myriad dharmas through a single word. If their habitual tendencies remain, they may revert to the views of the Middle or Lesser Vehicles—this is not Boduan’s fault.
