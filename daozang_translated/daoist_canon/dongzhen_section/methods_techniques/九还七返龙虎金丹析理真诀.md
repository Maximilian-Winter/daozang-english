Cheng Zhao, styled Shuming of Wuchang, records:

In my devotion to the Daoist gate, I have long been deeply attentive. Having perused the immortals’ scriptures and the hundred schools of furnace and fire, I have roughly examined them. Through studying the *Record of the Cavernous Origin*, the *Comprehensive Path Scripture*, the *Principles of the Primordial Chaos*, the *Golden and Azure Scripture*, the *Jade Flask, Dragon Embryo, Phoenix Wings*, as well as the *Great One* and *Triple Unification* texts, I have analyzed the firing times and grasped that the golden liquor returning elixir of the nine returns and seven reversions has three forms. The methods of cultivation are indeed manifold, their depths mutually explored and far-reaching. Yet the primordial mechanism is not distant—though scholars number in the tens of thousands, not one has succeeded. All fail because lead and mercury are difficult to distinguish, the yellow sprout remains unrecognized, and from this regretful loss, the primordial origin remains obscure. Thus, I have composed this over the years.

In the mid-spring of the *renshen* year of the Great Song, I encountered a rustic from the Four Bright Mountains. As I lodged with him, I inquired about the principles of the golden liquor returning elixir. The Daoist replied: "This matter is both most difficult and most easy—it cannot be lightly questioned." I earnestly entreated him again. The Daoist said: "Some claim golden blossoms to be the yellow sprout, or take ore as true lead—such people will never succeed. The yellow sprout is the marrow of the Five Phases; true lead is the true essence of the Great One. It arises within primordial chaos, emerges from the Great Beginning, is born at the inception of Heaven and Earth, and thus can serve as the mother of all things. The great elixir harmonizes the supremacy of the Five Phases and equals the workings of Heaven and Earth."

I bowed again and asked: "May I dare inquire—how does the golden liquor returning elixir arise?"

The Daoist said: "The golden elixir arises from the Great Beginning. The Great Beginning gives birth to primordial chaos; chaos gives rise to the Two Modes; the Two Modes establish the Three Powers; the Three Powers operate the Eight Trigrams; the Eight Trigrams nourish the Nine Palaces. The Nine Palaces mark the completion of the elixir, and thus the primacy of the Great One. May I ask—what is the name of the Great Beginning, and what substance in the medicine does the master point to?"

The Daoist said: "It is true lead. Lead is the essence of water; water is the body of yin. When yin reaches its extreme, yang is born, transforming the myriad things. Without yang, nothing is born; when yang departs, death follows. To enact transformation, one must first establish yang. The birth of yang occurs in profound obscurity—none know it. As the *Daoist Scripture* says: 'In the profound and obscure, therein lies essence—this essence is most true.' The *Triple Unification* models itself on the *Zhouyi*’s *Fu* hexagram of Earth over Thunder. The great yang is born at *zi*, the eleventh-month hexagram. Thus, the divine workings of Heaven and Earth, wishing to carve and adorn the myriad blossoms and unfold the thousand flowers, receive the yang line at the time of yin’s extremity, borrowing the盛 of great yin to assist the subtle yang’s achievement—this is the meaning of the Great Beginning. Those who do not know that the golden elixir arises from the Great Beginning recklessly ingest metals and minerals, seeking transformation. It is like pouring colored dye on the earth, hoping to dye the forms of flowers and trees."

I bowed again and asked: "What is the substance that the Great Beginning gives birth to in primordial chaos?"

The Daoist said: "Chaos is the appearance of unopened fullness—white without, yellow within, like a chicken’s egg. When yin and yang unite but their essences and qi have not yet merged, it is called chaos. May I further inquire—what is the name of chaos in the medicine, and to what category does it belong? This is the meaning in Master Cui’s *Dragon Embryo Scripture*. When lead and mercury first unite, dragon and tiger first embrace, sun and moon intermingle, yin and yang mutually resonate—thus the elixir is born in chaos. The moon emits its radiance, the sun extends its light; the dragon receives its embryo, the tiger releases its qi. Like gold and jade in slumber, spirit and brightness embrace. Upon awakening, the dragon extends its qi, the tiger spits forth its essence, and the divine chamber adheres without separation. As the *Embracing the Origin Scripture* says: 'Containing the origin and receiving qi, nothing is not fulfilled; obtaining qi and receiving the origin, nothing is not complete.' Consider the things of the world—without containing consciousness, they cannot embrace the origin. Without abandoning consciousness, none attain form and substance. People do not know the root of dragon and tiger, the transformative origin of yin and yang. Recklessly employing metals and minerals to forge the returning elixir is like retreating to seek what lies ahead or chasing the sun to flee one’s shadow. Thus, the True Lord Wei said: 'Entering water to seek chicken and rabbit, climbing mountains to search for fish and dragon—how true!' This is the lament of the *Triple Unification* for later generations who love the Dao, exhaustively seeking teachings and exhausting ancient texts. Sons inherit their fathers’ work; grandsons follow their ancestors’ path—this clarifies the principle of containing the origin and receiving qi. It also says: 'To hatch a chicken, one must use an egg; to grow grain, one must plant grain.' And: 'The simurgh and sparrow do not give birth to phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses.' This is the meaning. People do not understand the Dao of containing the origin and embracing the embryo. They seek medicine from distant lands, smelting metals and refining minerals. If the great elixir could be completed with the five metals and eight minerals, then the True Lord Wei would not have composed the *Triple Unification*, and Master Cui would not have elucidated the *Great One Diagram*. The *Triple Unification* speaks of the mutual stirring of the two qi, the mutual impelling of the Eight Trigrams, the alternating residence of cold and heat, the opening and closing of yin and yang. If the two qi lose their measure, the myriad things do not flourish; if the Five Phases exceed their norm, the ten thousand spirits lose their order. How could the great elixir tolerate miscellaneous categories to achieve completion? Moreover, the *Great One Diagram* says: 'The Great One roams the Nine Palaces but does not enter the central position.' If one understands the Great One, then the center is water; the central palace is earth. Earth is the ghost of water—thus it detests the central palace and does not enter it."

As the elixir traverses the Eight Trigrams and later enters the central palace, it ripens into refined gold. The generals stationed near the Great One must exhibit the phenomenon of cyclical progression—thus, the Great One is likened to mercury, while the generals represent metals and minerals, clarifying that the great elixir does not employ metallic or mineral substances. Furthermore, when multiple entities share the same palace, they become imprisoned, indicating forbidden practices; this reveals that the Dragon Embryo Elixir does not incorporate miscellaneous categories. Moreover, it is made clear that *zi* and *wu* (midnight and noon) are the qi of transformation, while *mao* and *you* (dawn and dusk) are the qi of cessation—these are all temporal markers of the elixir’s progression.

Someone asked: What are the Two Modes?
The Daoist replied: The Two Modes refer to the division of Heaven and Earth, the separation of forms, with yin and yang each occupying their respective positions—sun in the east, moon in the west, *li* in the south, and *kan* in the north.

Again, they asked: What manifestation does the presence of the Two Modes produce within the elixir?
The Daoist said: The Two Modes within the elixir signify the distinct separation of lead and mercury. Once the Two Modes are established, in the heavens they give rise to the sun, moon, and stars; in the elixir, they become the Three, Five, and One. When the medicine reaches this stage, spiritual transformation is not far off.

They further inquired: What is the Three, Five, and One?
The Daoist replied: One is water, two is fire—together they make three. From these three, the five naturally emerge. This is water, fire, and earth, also called the lead, mercury, and crucible. It is also named the Three Substances as One Body, or the One Substance with Three Forms. Yanluo Zi said: This is the Dao of the Three-in-One, for within the great elixir, only gold, water, and earth are present.

Again, they asked: How are gold, water, and earth distinguished?
The Daoist said: Gold is lead, and lead is true gold and true earth—not the lead of the mundane world, but that which is born within the profound obscurity of the Great Void, the true essence of the Great One, the central line within *kan*. Thus it is said: Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; humanity attains the One and becomes numinous. If one seeks numinosity in humanity, nothing surpasses the study of the Dao of longevity and immortality. Laozi said: When the child attains the One, all matters are complete. The immortals of ancient times guarded the secrecy of lead’s singular nature, as the ancient song states: *If lead is true, it does not lose its household retainers; if lead is not true, it cannot befriend mercury.* Lead and mercury are of the same family.

The *Dragon’s Nest Scripture* also states: When a sage receives the mandate, they must possess a heart in harmony with virtue—these are of the same family. Ears, eyes, limbs, and trunk are its harbors; when it descends, ghosts and spirits cannot approach; when it ascends, Heaven and Earth combine their strength. This is to say that lead and mercury are of one family, and the elixir cannot be completed with external miscellaneous substances. The ancient song says: *Though the paths of south and north diverge, in obscurity they are one family.* Yet世人 often mistake gold, silver, lead, and tin for lead, or laugh at silver sprouts, golden butterflies, and golden ants as lead, attempting to refine the elixir—this is like watering rotten wood to seek blossoms or drilling ice to await fire! They do not comprehend the myriad categories, nor recognize their root and branches, and thus, despite countless efforts, achieve nothing.

Moreover, all these substances are inert and lifeless matter—how could they possess spiritual transformation or the power to renew marrow and sinew? Thus, the *Triple Unification* states: *Foxes and hares do not nurse horses; swallows and sparrows do not hatch phoenixes.* This is the meaning. It also says: *Work is easily accomplished with the same kind; skill is difficult with different kinds.* And: *When a hen incubates an egg, the days are fulfilled, and the mother gives birth to the chick after ten months are complete.* One plants grain with millet and hatches a chicken with an egg.

Furthermore, the twelve types of lead in the world are all unsuitable for the great elixir: black lead, red lead, Jiazhou lead, raw lead, grass-joint lead, Longtuo lead, white tin-lead, silver lead, and gold-smelted lead—all are dead, inert substances of the mundane world. Even if forcibly ingested, they pass through the large intestine and descend—how could they constitute the Dao of longevity, enduring vision, and immortality?

They asked: If mundane lead is unfit for ingestion, where does true lead come from?
The Daoist replied: True lead-earth emerges from non-being into being, receiving its form from Heaven and Earth and its substance from the sun and moon. When ruler and minister unite, when father and mother give birth, it begins as a minute speck and grows into a pound of numinous essence, with bones and flesh complete, blood and qi abundant. At the mere sight of mercury, it is immediately subdued. Thus, Qingxia Zi said: *When emotions harmonize, no other medicines are needed; when qi harmonizes, no words are spoken.* This is the meaning.

Again, they asked: Among the sources of mercury, which is suitable for refinement?
The Daoist said: Mercury also has several varieties: natural mercury, white sand mercury, cinnabar mercury. Only cinnabar mercury is used in elixir refinement. Moreover, cinnabar itself has many types: celestial throne cinnabar, divine throne cinnabar, purple numinous cinnabar, luminous cinnabar, commercial cinnabar, iron-veined cinnabar, stream cinnabar, and earth cinnabar. The celestial throne, jade throne, golden throne, and divine throne cinnabars are all naturally returning elixirs, requiring no firing or refinement—ingesting them leads to immortality. The immortals of the heavens, riding cranes and dragons, come to retrieve them, and mundane people cannot perceive them. Luminous and purple numinous cinnabars are suitable for refining the great elixir, while commercial and earth cinnabars are unfit for ingestion and only useful for minor arts.

They further asked: What is earth?
The Daoist replied: Earth is singular in flavor, and its true meaning is profound—it is not the earth of the mundane world. People often mistake sulfur, realgar, orpiment, arsenic, litharge, silver powder, lead yellow flowers, white silver, and yellow gold for earth, attempting to submerge them in water—none of these are suitable. Earth has no fixed form; it arises when qi converges and takes shape when conditions align. Thus, it is born in the four *meng* (first months of seasons), reigns in the four *ji* (last months), ceases in the four *zhong* (middle months), stabilizes the central palace, resides in *bing* and *ding*, and shares qi with water.

Should one take the aforementioned substances as true earth, does its origin share the same blackness as water? True earth is the quintessential essence of the Five Phases. It must be refined through divine union and transformation to generate and nurture, thereby uniting with Heaven and Earth in form, its spiritual transformations boundless. Only then is it fit to serve as the dwelling for the elixir.

They further asked: When gold, water, and earth combine to form the great elixir, the ingredients are few—how can its power be so vast? And how many days must one tend the crucible before it ripens?
The Daoist replied: As the *Cantong Qi* states:
*"At first seventy, then three decades,
Three hundred sixty, well-tempered and even."*
Thus, it matures in one full year—this is the cycle of the Great One through the heavens. Without completing this celestial revolution, the great elixir cannot ripen. Master Wei’s discourse on the celestial numbers speaks of a year in the grand scheme, or a single day in the lesser. Thus, year aligns with month, month with day, day with hour. The method of nurturing through the revolving stars takes but a day and night for one full cycle.

Master Qingxia said:
*"The crucible is no metal vessel,
The furnace no mere drug stove.
Departing from Kan’s depths, it rises;
Mercury dwells within the earth’s embrace.
Sealed tight, the embryo leaks not—
Transformation occurs in but a moment."*
Thus, one need not seek distant crucibles.

An ancient song says:
*"Day by day, it rests in your own dwelling,
Knowing the white, guarding the black—
The numinous manifests!"*

They dared ask: What does "knowing the white, guarding the black" mean?
The Daoist replied: The white is the essence of metal, the black the foundation of water—these two are the great treasures of Heaven and Earth, the purest essences of sun and moon. They symbolize ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, woman and man.

They again asked: Might you deign to outline the initial steps for refining the elixir?
The Daoist said: The golden elixir must embrace the primordial, knit the embryo, unfold the flower, and bear the fruit—this is called returning to the root and restoring the origin. As Master Yinluo said: *"Deep roots and firm stems are the Way of long life and enduring vision."* And again: *"Deep roots yield flourishing flowers and plump fruit; thus the noble one attends to the root, and with the root established, the Dao arises."* If one inwardly aligns with the Dao, the golden elixir will naturally arrive, its form and shadow inseparable, its sound and echo in perfect resonance.

The Daoist continued: It begins with cinnabar, which transforms into mercury, mercury into gold, gold into liquid, and the liquid into the elixir—hence it is called the *Golden Liquid Returned Elixir*. The elixir is of vermilion hue; returning to earth, it reverts to the origin, thus wood returns to its source. As Master Yuanyang said:
*"Gold refines into gold, silver into silver—
When has there ever been another divine marvel?
Naturally subduing fire, it withstands a hundred smeltings without decay,
Enters water like a paste, fire like gold,
Melts in the mouth with a sweet fragrance.
How could the world’s miscellaneous metals, stones, flowers, or trees
Ever achieve such divine transformation?"*

They further asked: What does "embracing the primordial embryo, unfolding the flower, and bearing the fruit" entail?
The Daoist replied: It is the binding of the dragon’s embryo and the refining of the tiger’s essence. The divine water nurtures the yellow sprout. Since the Three Sovereigns, this has been transmitted mouth-to-mouth, never committed to writing, lest the celestial mechanism be revealed. Those who speak recklessly will sink through three kalpas. My disciple, keep this hidden and do not speak of it.

They asked again: Grateful for your guidance, I now perceive the fundamental principle. If the materials required are few and the crucible and ingredients easily obtained, may I proceed with the refinement according to the method?
The Daoist said: To refine the elixir, three conditions must be met: fortune, virtue, and resolve. Without fortune, it will not succeed. As the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* states: If the elixir, upon ripening, appears as hills, graves, or skeletal forms, it is unfit for ingestion—cast it into the flowing stream and refine anew. This is the sign of lacking fortune. Without virtue, one cannot contain and store the elixir. For instance, Zhao Yuanbo transmitted the elixir formula to the Crown Prince of Yanzhong, who coveted wealth. He used it to forge gold and silver, cast vessels, and refine external medicines. Before the elixir was complete, the prince grew angry and had Yuanbo drowned in a well—this is the consequence of lacking virtue. Without resolve, one cannot endure the hardships of study; even a minor setback breeds great regret. Like the two Xue brothers of Hezhong, who failed to complete the elixir, burned all their alchemical texts and tools in the street, and upon encountering Daoist travelers, drew their swords in furious pursuit, shouting: *"Begone, you deceitful lot!"* Soon after, they fell from their horses and died—this, too, is the result of lacking resolve. Though you possess resolve, your fortune and virtue are not yet complete. Seek one of great fortune and broad virtue to undertake this together—only then may it succeed.

They asked again: Earlier, you said those who speak recklessly will sink through three kalpas. Now you advise seeking others to refine together—does this not violate the divine command?
The Daoist replied: Since ancient times, three sharing a single resolve has been the way—this is not reckless speech. The three are gold, water, and earth; more than three constitutes recklessness. Noble one, adhere strictly to my discourse: transcribe, compile, and copy it in order. Follow the sequence of movements, pairings, and timings, and the resonances will manifest. Disseminate it in the world, and those with affinity will encounter it. As for the oral instructions, transmit them mouth-to-mouth, heart-to-heart—do not violate the divine command.

At the break of dawn, he took his leave, and none knew where he went. I, having received the Daoist’s instructions, recorded them in full to pass on to those who cherish the Dao—pray, do not discard them!
