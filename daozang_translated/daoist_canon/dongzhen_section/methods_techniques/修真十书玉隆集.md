**The Thirty-First Scroll of the *Ten Books on Cultivating the True*: *Jade Mound Collection* – "Record of the Immortal Gathering Pavilion at Jade Mound Palace"**
*By Bai Yuchan of Hainan*

Maps of mountains and seas abound with talismanic prophecies; ancient dialects and archaic speech often pertain to the reckoning of celestial motions. Long ago, on the day when Xu, the Grand Scribe of the Nine Provinces’ Immortal Assembly and Minister of Supreme Clarity, ascended to the heavens, he left these words: *"One thousand two hundred and forty years hence, within the Five Mounds, eight hundred earthbound immortals shall appear, and their master shall emerge from Yuzhang. The verification lies in the Dragon Sands of the prefectural river."* Now, the time has come as foretold.

Master Wu of Puyun happened to encounter this destined moment. The prefect, hearing of his Dao, summoned him to preside over Jade Mound as a Yellow-Capped Daoist, governing the four directions. Wind-tossed kerchiefs and rain-worn hats gathered like ants. Though an old cloud hall already stood there, Master Wu, seeing its perilous state—nearly collapsed—had it dismantled and rebuilt anew. A pavilion was erected atop it, inscribed with the name *"Dragon Sands Immortal Assembly."* Immortals favor dwelling in towers, and this was indeed their fitting abode.

Later, the Purple Clarity Perfected, White Jade Toad, traversed the Eight Cinnamons, sailed the Three Xiang Rivers, and drifted down the Mian River, passing Mount Lu. People say Jade Mound is the foremost dwelling of true immortals in the world, yet through the passage of wind and rain, its once-noble halls had fallen into near-ruin under nine of ten negligent masters. Now, however, one has arisen to revive its fallen legacy, stirring a sudden flourishing. The Emperor and Empress, hearing of it, bestowed silk and coin; marquises and earls, upon seeing it, adorned its gates with flowers. Daoist masters in yellow caps all revered and admired him, while the incorruptible and the timid alike called him *"Master Wu of Puyun."*

I, Jade Toad, said: *"Master Wu of Puyun and I have long been parted. I went to pay my respects."* Upon arrival, he welcomed me with such haste that he nearly overturned his sandals. After tea, he led me through the pavilion and explained its significance. Then, gathering his disciples, he exhorted them: *"This is the assembly hall of the immortals of West Mountain, where scholars from the Jiang, Han, lakes, and seas gather from afar. Here, they feast on mist and rosy clouds, delighting in the enchantments of wind and moon. Staffs lean against the walls; shoes are left outside the doors. Together, they wander and recline, ascending to lofty heights and gazing upon boundless vistas. Here, one may compose poetry—verdant cliffs and white clouds become verses. Here, one may drink wine—crimson springs and jade mushrooms become flavors. Fragrant grasses and misty vapors may enter our paintings; ancient vines and strange trees may enter our calligraphy. By day, hidden birds sing, and the zither rests across the lap; by night, cold crows call, and the flute lies across the railing. In the quiet of the courtyard, a sword may hum in its scabbard; as tea’s fragrance lingers, a chess piece may tap the board. At dawn’s window, the *Book of Changes* is studied, cinnabar ground with dew; at noon’s desk, scriptures are recited, jade chimes carried on the wind. Worldly burdens cannot disturb their celestial purity; right and wrong cannot muddy their clear hearing. Truly, this is the comfort of leisurely living—how could one not recognize the mark of Dragon Sands?*

*"Though the appointed number is but a hundred years away, the seasons draw near. Those who strive to be first in witnessing this, who boldly awaken and gradually cultivate, who inwardly refine the essence of the Three Dragons and Four Tigers, and outwardly harmonize with the transformations of the Seven Crows and Nine Toads—who exhaust principle, fulfill nature, and reach destiny; who accumulate truth and amass qi to refine the spirit—will find it no difficult task to be numbered among the eight hundred immortals. But if one still harbors ambitions for the mundane world, exerting effort for the people—climbing Mount Song, studying military strategy, discoursing on the kingly Way, awaiting the golden chariot at the Gate of Shao, or tracing the footsteps of the Historian Under the Pillar—then one cannot remain here. If one merely indulges in tower-dwelling for self-amusement, idling away the years, this is not only a concern for those who study the Dao and cultivate immortality, but also a shame for those who lead this path. Gentlemen, why not urge one another forward with resolve?"*

The assembly received his words and nodded in assent.

Alas! From the year *wuyin* to now, I have passed West Mountain thrice. Immortals and mortals walk shoulder to shoulder, their depths unfathomable. From this pavilion, my thoughts soar freely. Given Master Wu’s expectations of me, how can I know that the master of Yuzhang does not reside here? Thus, I record his exhortations in this account.

**"Record of the Hall of Supreme Heaven at Chongzhen Palace on Mount Hezao"**

I have heard that the Dao encompasses the primordial chaos, existing before the Lord of Images; that the circulation of qi and the configuration of the earth reach their apex in the zenith of Supreme Heaven. The wondrous realm of the Mysterious and True is the land of subtle existence; the palace of the Vast and Luminous is the supreme capital of the boundless. Radiant and expansive, the Purple Gold Cloud Brahma’s gates stand vast and serene; misty and azure, the Jade Clarity Palace is established in the Great Subtlety, exalted in the Great Possession—this is the abode of the highest sages. Rightly named the *"Unoriginated,"* it directly governs the ten directions through the Mysterious Model and oversees the three realms through the wondrous mechanism of transformation.

In the rituals of the southern suburbs, there was once the Altar of the Circular Mound. In the Daoist tradition, the worship of Heaven is especially sacred. How can one say there is no silent record? Why not preserve the sincerity of facing the August One?

Chongzhen Palace, a blessed land on Mount Hezao, once had a hall for the worship of the Emperor. Though grand, it was not ornate; though simple, it was crude. Plans were made to dismantle and renew it when Yang Shunchen of Qingjiang’s lakes and mountains—a scholar who reveres the Dao and honors Heaven—generously donated fifty thousand strings of cash. Alone, he replaced the old with the new. Carpenters wielded their tools; potters applied their craft. Construction began in the winter of *renshen* and was completed in the autumn of *yihai*, spanning four years and ten thousand labors. Truly, this was no small feat!

In the summer of *gengchen* in the *Jiading* era, I came to Mount Hezao. There, I encountered Master Chongmiao, Zhu Jixiang, who oversaw the temple. He informed me of the newly built Hall of Supreme Heaven from six years prior and asked me to compose this record.

I thought of Tao Hongjing, who wrote a record for the Emperor, and Li He, who composed the *"Jade Tower Record."* Though I lack the literary brilliance of Tao and Li, I deeply admire them. I said to Master Chongmiao: *"The dwelling of the Supreme Emperor is layered with countless strands of Dao-qi, where twelve hundred officials and lords weave emptiness into heaven and condense Brahma into walls. The Three Camps merge to form towers and terraces; the Nine Rosy Clouds transform into palaces and halls."*

Amidst mist-woven walls and rainbow-paved foundations, thunderous towers rise with lightning-saliva eaves. Feilian oversees the gathering of jade-osmanthus and gem-hawthorn timber, while the imperial seal commands the assembly of black-lacquered orchids and coral-thorned junipers. Jade pendants clink in ritual sway, and lustrous pillars stand like polished pillars of jade.

Crimson chariots guard the cinnabar steps, and feathered banners cluster at the purple gates. Consorts and concubines encircle like the allure of a jade forest, while ranks of courtiers array like the profusion of a gem garden. Fire-bell-bearing celestial soldiers attend the halls, and golden spirit-beasts crouch at the doors. Above, nine-tiered locks of unicorn lightning seal the gates; below, five-jeweled gates of dawn’s dew shimmer like rosy barriers.

The fat of jade phoenixes is rendered to feed the snow-white jade-toads of the jasper courtyard, and the gall of gem tigers is split to nourish the cloud-luminous golden hares of the beryl terrace. On jade-moth-strummed cloud-zithers at dusk, and gem-maidens dancing in rainbow skirts at dawn, eight simurghs sing in the windy halls, and nine tigers roar between the swinging gates. Within, phoenix-litters rest in jeweled coils; without, rosy mists drape crane-feathered robes by the jade pool.

Feasting in the Jade Capital, delighting in the Golden Palace, each thing transforms of itself, every affair unfolds without contrivance. Mortals enjoy the span of *shima* years, their longevity matching the aeons of the *fushi* stone.

This account but sketches its faint outline—how the ministers of Shun now serve the Emperor’s detached palace, a vision glimpsed as through a veil.

As for the treasure hall’s profound depths, its cloud-crowned towering eaves, the sovereign’s radiant countenance, and the serpentine jade throne: the floors are paved with floral bricks, the walls washed with silver liquid. Central and peripheral offerings stand ready, while attendants and banners flank left and right. Phoenix-embossed tiles line the base, paired tiles gleam above. A thousand pillars catch the sun, ten thousand brackets congeal the mist. Lofty and vast, it dominates the mortal realm. Crimson light and purple haze dazzle, vermilion doors and yellow canopies command reverence. Daoist adepts turn their hearts toward it, and sacred mountains gain in majesty.

By worldly standards, those who offer millet gruel or wheat porridge earn the Son of Heaven’s favor; those who present grain are enfeoffed, those who gift horses are appointed. Though the Jade Emperor reigns high above, His gaze is keen, His hearing acute. Thus, the blessings bestowed upon Shun’s ministers—how boundless they must be!

Yet the virtue of the Supreme Emperor defies clear speech. He who unfolds heaven and holds the tally governs the eternal *Yankang* reign;

Embracing the true and embodying the Dao, he silently upholds the chart of primordial chaos. Yet the dull and dim-witted, teeming amid heaven and earth—how could they know the Emperor’s power? It is said that the loftiest heaven bestows blessings upon those who seek them; the eel can ascend the Dipper, the otter can offer sacrifice to heaven—how much more so for man? The subtle and wondrous declare: so it is.

In the seventh month of that year, on the first day, Qiongshan’s Bai Yuchan respectfully inscribed this within the palace hall.

**Record of the Emerald-Gushing Pavilion**

Reclusive poets and carefree wanderers, who appraise mountains and waters, who discourse on wind and moon, all say: the Jiangnan region is a den of mountains and waters, Jiangxi a nest of wind and moon. In the *jiading wuyin* year, Qiongshan’s Bai Yuchan, sword in hand, passed through Yulong, visited Fuchuan, and traveled through Wucheng. Twin peaks pierced the mist, a single dragon clashed with the moon. Resting west of Wucheng, gazing east toward the great river, he grasped his sword and let out a long cry, turned to the heavens and loosed a piercing whistle.

All around Wucheng were mountains. Verdant cliffs and emerald ravines, green pines and white stones, cold gibbons calling in the trees, ancient streams stirring the wind, sheer crags stacked in layers, towering banks a thousand feet high—soaring like cranes dancing in the sky, coiling like dragons enveloped in mist: such was Liushan. White duckweed and red reeds, purple bamboo and gray sands, fish drifting in sapphire waves, gulls resting beneath the pale moon, a sea of jade stretching boundless, a thousand skiffs of bream and perch—graceful as the radiant goddess draped in rosy clouds, serene as the Xiang maiden’s vale: such was the Xiu River.

Beneath the mountain flowed the river; above the river stood a pavilion. The pavilion was named *Emerald-Gushing*, inspired by Su Dongpo’s line: *"the mountain forms emerald waves surging."* Beholding its scenery, unfolding its vistas—like the Yugutai of Zhang and Gong, like the Pipa Pavilion of Xunyang—such was the Emerald-Gushing Pavilion. Its eaves soared into the sky, its reflection dipped into the water; sky’s light and water’s hue mirrored above and below. Misty willows and cloud-like threads draped high and low like curtains. Green windows leaked moonlight, vermilion eaves nibbled the rain; ornate beams leapt with phoenixes, tiled roofs spread with mandarin ducks. Four walls free of dust, a single chamber like a painting; jade railings framed the view, a silver sea congealed in clarity. Gulls and egrets remained undisturbed, turtles and fish rejoiced in bliss. Those who matched their wine to their capacity, who gave free rein to their poetic hearts—such were the pavilion’s guests.

When the wind parts the willow’s eyes and dew moistens the peach’s cheeks; when orioles call forth spring and azure birds usher in the rain; when crabapple blushes tender purple and peonies bloom crimson—when green willows hum with silk-like songs, when bamboo shoots shed their sheaths, when turtledoves summon the clear sky, when rain ripens the yellow plums and sun steeps the green plums—such is summer. When locust shade lingers unbroken and cicadas first arrive; when autumn flowers stand wordless and morning dew begins to form; when the harvest retreats from the mat and the Frost Maiden prepares her attire—such is autumn. When osmanthus seeds ride the high wind and reed flowers age beneath the moon; when streams grow lean and emerald, when mountains turn stark and cold; when a thousand cliffs reveal their plum blossoms and a single snowfall heralds the year’s end—such is winter. What more could one desire?

At dawn’s sun, a myriad mountains blush crimson and green; at dusk’s crow, the last trees gleam purple and emerald. When paulownia blossoms scatter and the mandarin orange’s embers fade; when idle days stretch long and quietude magnifies the heavens; when fishermen’s boats sing at dusk and woodcutters’ flutes startle the rosy clouds—sometimes there is the zither: the ape in the breast sobs, the spring beneath the fingers mourns. Sometimes there is the game of Go: the *tok-tok* of jade stones, the stars scattered across the board. Sometimes there is calligraphy: spring serpents slither into grass, evening moths return to reeds. Sometimes there is painting: rivers and mountains transformed, grasses and trees reborn in spring. With such pure inspiration, such pure seclusion, one gathers it into a life of wine, embraces it into a world of poetry—so enraptured by this pavilion that one forgets the self and the world.

Mountain light vast and boundless, river’s force surging and crashing; pine’s voice like roaring waves, moon’s radiance like flowing water. A thousand fireflies flicker, rising and falling with the floating light; a single bird’s song echoes, answered before and behind. Azure wings dance, purple hues congeal, green flows into gray—thus it is called *Emerald-Gushing*.

The reed bay stretches endlessly, the islet’s expanse knows no bounds. Turning back before the pavilion, one pours the finest wine. Inviting guests into the cup’s embrace, chanting new verses, great scholars and renowned literati gather in succession, their poetry boards like combs, their lofty rhymes like frost. The first sings, the next responds; long verses for today, short verses for antiquity—none can exhaust its delights.

Most wondrous is when spring snow drifts in the void, high and low like jade trees; when the night moon immerses the water, inside and out like an ice flask. Where the fisherman’s song fades, green irises float upon the sky; when the sail’s shadow sinks, green sedge swells the banks. Amid the rustling reeds and rushes, boats come and go—endless joy resides within.

Who built this pavilion? Li Yafu. One day, Tan Yuanzhen of Tongcheng and Huang Rixin of Shangqing joined me, carrying our zithers to rest upon it. The wind stirred our crane-like sleeves, and others mistook us for water immortals. We composed several stanzas, drained a hundred cups; the moon’s shadow lay upon the earth, horses and servants waited at the gate. Taking up the brush without thought, I merely recorded the savor of mountains, waters, wind, and moon. Those who know this savor—can they then not raise their cups in song? The pavilion’s master said: indeed.

I, too, was drunk. The next day, in reflection, I thought: worldly affairs are like fleeting sparks, human life like drifting duckweed. Where is Penglai? The Yellow Crane never comes. Clutching my zither and grasping my sword, I danced once more upon the pavilion.

Written by the *Shenxiao* Scattered Scribe.

**Record of the Hall of the Far Heart**

The crane is a numinous bird—why then does it nest among egrets and mandarin ducks? Yet it shares the same hills and plains, feeds on the same grain, and is no different from those marsh-dwelling fowl. But when it soars gracefully beyond the rosy clouds, leaving wind and dust behind, guest of the azure haze, gliding through the vault of heaven—then its numinosity far surpasses that of egrets and mandarin ducks.

The lotus is a flower of wondrous beauty—why then does it grow among the water caltrops? Yet it mingles with the same leeches and mud, no different from those common blooms. But when it rises radiantly from the mire, bathed in limpid waters, charming as silver frost, resplendent as a jade well—then its beauty far exceeds that of the water caltrops.

Consider Laozi, who served as an archivist beneath the pillar; Zhuangzi, who held office in the Painted Garden; Zhang Lu, who ruled within his chambers; Xu Xun, who governed Jingyang; and Mei Fu, who served as a magistrate in Nanchang. In those days, they differed not at all from ordinary men. Yet when their inner essence was firmly established and their hidden conduct outwardly fulfilled, when they vanished into transformation and ascended to the dawn, riding qilin and dragons, driving phoenixes and cranes, mounting clouds and riding qi, whistling to the wind and lashing the thunder, climbing Kunlun, joining the depths of the void—only then did they stir the heart and astonish the eye, evoking awe and longing.

When Zhu Maichen was cast aside by his wife, when Su Qin was scorned by his sister-in-law, it was no wonder. For in the beginning, when they blended their light with the world and mingled with the common, they seemed so lowly that others felt ashamed of their own inferiority, or perhaps grew contemptuous and mocked them. But when deeds that astonish and delight the world emerged, they were as startled as mirages, as gathered sighs like mice. Little did they know—though their bodies were bound in cages, their aspirations soared to the heavens.

Alas! When the swan flies into the distant skies, what can the fowler desire?

The swallows and sparrows beneath the fence do but chirp in vain. Yet the sage never sought to be different from others, nor did he ever first display himself to the world. If a fish wishes to differ from a land-bound fish, it leaps from the water onto the shore and dies; if a tiger wishes to differ from a grassland tiger, it leaves the mountains for the marketplace and is captured. Though they may blend seamlessly and forget one another, transforming as one, what they attain is far beyond the reach of the others.

When Tao Yuanming lived in the final years of the Jin as Liu’s dynasty rose, he felt shame at bending his waist for a mere peck of rice, so he left and returned to Chaisang, delighting his heart all day with wine. This was his way of forgetting the world—drunk, he dreamed of self and things dissolving into chaff, the heavens and earth into husks, profoundly free from scheming, serene and without design. Thus, his writings of the time transcended the vulgar.

He Guojun, styled Junhui, a native of Qingjiang, had parents and brothers all adorned with official caps and sashes, yet he alone followed the teachings of Laozi. His aspirations were lofty and elusive, beyond measure. Twice he held office, but several times he carried his qin and sword to the capital, where even the powerful and noble deferred to him. The imperial court honored his noble bearing, bestowing upon him the title of "Master of Profound Wonder." Today, the altar of the Forty-Fourth Generation Sword, Seal, and Talisman of the Great Ultimate Lord Ge Xian is entrusted to him. He was especially skilled in the texts of gold, mercury, dragon, and tiger, as well as in the arts of Six Ren, Eight Gates, Three Jia, and Five Thunder. He could compose poetry, master ritual and music, and with his green eyes and ruddy cheeks, he was the very image of refined elegance.

At Longyuan in Chengxing, he revived the Xianyuan Abbey, appointing Huang Huayi as its master, with He Juyuan as his deputy. In the abbey’s main hall, he inscribed Tao’s line *"My heart far removed"* on a plaque and entrusted me with recording its story.

The heart—stilled, it does not clear; stirred, it does not muddy. It cannot be grasped when near, nor abandoned when far. Still and unmoving, yet responsive when touched, it encompasses heaven and earth, yet enters a mustard seed. Like a jade lotus untouched by water, like clouds already part of the sky, it drifts like a fish in clear streams, soars like a tiger crossing mountains, glides like a swan skimming clouds. Poverty and low status cannot sway it; wealth and honor cannot bend it. Dwelling in the mountains, it remains serene; abiding in the marketplace, it never grows clamorous. This is what it means to be *"in the world yet not of it, amid dust yet unstained by it."*

Master Zhu realized the truth of *"the great hermit dwelling in the city"* and understood the line *"when the heart is far, the place is secluded."* With arms folded like lotus petals and legs crossed in ease, he had poetry to chant and scrolls to hold—never entangled in worldly snares or bound by trivial cares. His work was untouched by dust. Beneath the pine window, the white day passed in languor; ancient trees and green vines filled the courtyard, while distant sands and waters adorned the walls. Steep cliffs and deep ravines, swift rapids and mournful torrents, open plains and wild mounds, rainbows rooted like jiao dragons—wind at dusk, dew at dawn, moonlit nights and starry skies—all lay within his books without ever stepping beyond his door. His heart was at ease, his eyes sated, his face flushed, his ears warm. No flattering guests knocked at his gate; only a cunning tripod stood in his open pavilion. He loosened his robes, sprawled on the floor, pillowed his head, and slept deeply. Right and wrong never reached his heart; favor and disgrace never entered his ears. He concealed his form like a sealed vessel, merged his spirit with the cosmos, trod the vast earth as if it were a grain of millet, and gazed upon the long river as if it flowed from a pitcher. His eyes closed, his mind stilled—heaven and earth settled into stillness, emptiness blossomed, and in the face of phenomena, his heart was unmoved; in the face of his heart, phenomena vanished. He had already transcended the clouds and skies.

Then, morning and night, he studied Laozi and Zhuangzi, befriended Zhang and Xu, and communed with Tao Yuanming beyond form and shadow. What need had he for apes and cranes as companions, or deer as neighbors, to distance his heart from the world?

Some may regard Su [Dongpo] and Zhu as described above and think, *"What is lacking in such a life?"* Yet in quietude, with a cold eye, Zhu merely smiled—the affairs of the world were as insipid as a cup of water.

Alas! The heart is one, but people divide it. Those who debase themselves on the path of profit and rank can never attain true distance. Some, like the destitute scholar with lofty aspirations, or the solitary, towering figure yearning for the misty skies, have hearts that are far indeed. Yet none compare to one who, amid the red dust of the four quarters and the blue smoke of ten thousand hearths, dwells in the bustling marketplace as if it were a forest spring—already as remote as if separated by a curtain. To cross the weak waters of Penglai is no feat for one whose heart is not enlightened; only one like Master Zhu could achieve this. All is of the same origin—beyond measure.

Someone asked, *"What is the meaning of 'far'?"*
I replied: *"Dust in the air is like falling snow, yet unseen; ants beneath the bed are as vast as the Dipper and Ox, yet unheard. If one can awaken to this, then even a humble room feels lofty, and in looking up and down, the cosmos seems boundless. Whatever one sees or hears, the heart grows ever more distant—like mud and clouds."*

This record was written by Master Han Jing, styled Shihan, at the request of [Zhu] Jun. Recorded by Muzhai.

Master Liu Guibo of the Daoist order, wearing the black and yellow cap, named his studio *Mu Zhai* ("Herding Studio") and commissioned this record from me.

I have heard that the Yellow Emperor addressed a young horse-herder as "Heavenly Master," and Śākyamuni pointed to a young cowherd as a bodhisattva. Heaven is the horse, Earth the ox—how does the sage herd them? Thus it is said: to nurture the self through humility is the meaning of *herding*.

When herding sheep, one first removes the withered grass, so there is no fear of entanglement in thorns. The old man of the frontier, in his herding, initially harbored no concern for gain or loss. The Son of Heaven appoints *tanmu* officials to herd the people—this is the same principle.

Guibo’s poetry is deeply impassioned, yet he dismisses it as *lazy*; his wine is generous, yet he excuses it as *drunkenness*; his brilliance is keen, yet he declines it as *unwise*; his zither is pure, yet he rejects it as *not ancient*. Skilled in refining the inner elixir and commanding the Five Thunders, he always demurs, saying he *knows nothing*—such is his humility, this self-herding. No need for whip or bridle, for all is already tame and familiar.

In the Buddhist teaching, it is called *both man and ox lost*; in the Daoist teaching, *both herdsman and horse forgotten*—who then is the herder? It is self-herding, and Guibo has attained this.

**Hearing Zhao the Lute Player’s Plaint on the Strings**
*By Bai Yuchan of Hainan*

I sought seclusion where gibbons cry,
Clouds veil the mountains, blossoms choke the stream.
Seventy-two peaks stand sheer as walls,
Wind stirs my sleeves—heaven itself a ladder.

The adept’s temples bind the wind in black,
Her silver hair pins the moon’s white light.
The eaves’ teeth bit the rain—now skies are clear,
Pines crow at dawn, the night’s zither hums.

Inspired, I clutch a stone, light as the arcane,
Enraptured, seven strings stretch like jade threads.
Fingers dance on my knee, chiming bright,
Dazzling as thirty stars snatched from the sky.

At first, like rain on plantain leaves at night,
Then, seated long beneath the wutong tree, the gibbons cease.
As if by a hidden stream, I hear a murmuring spring,
Or bamboo’s clatter mingling with summer’s chill.

First, I mistook it for Jing Ke crossing the Yi,
Then, as if urging, “Do not cross the river!”
A beauty parts from her golden tent, Xiang Ji,
A warrior blows his iron flute, Meng Po’s lament.

Or perhaps two pheasants, south and north divided,
Or a wife tugging at Su Wu’s tattered robes.
Why does the lute sound like the Xiang Consort’s grief?
Why do the fingers weep like Wang Zhaojun’s sorrow?

Not the waxen peaks’ lament below,
Nor the barbarian reed’s cry in late autumn.
Yet naturally, the distant frontier’s woes descend,
Suddenly, cicadas’ clamor fades past the southern tower.

Do not play to the end—I fear to listen,
My breast brims with the sorrows of rise and fall.
Cangwu’s clouds mourn Yu Shun’s distant passing,
Dinghu’s mists veil the Yellow Emperor’s jade.

Note by note, again and again,
Heedless of the world’s silvering hair.
The strings exhaust the twilight’s fading glow,
Then turn to play beneath the mountain’s moon.

Hu Changqing—long gone,
Han Feiqiong—no such hand.
Has the Jade Emperor heard?
Mortals vainly bow their heads.

Willow catkins drift like mist over the river city,
Beyond the walls, crabapple weeps crimson tears.
I fear your lingering thoughts are not yet stilled—
For me, let the spring day’s orioles sing in the sun.

**To the Adept of Fanghu**
*For the High Adept Ding of Penglai*

The Three Mountains of Penglai press the Weak Waters,
Crows never exhaust the rising five-colored clouds.
Purple unicorns dance at dawn in Danqiu’s mists,
White deer graze at night on yellow sprout elixirs.

A boundless divine wind, azure and vast,
Three thousand leagues of empty sky, parched rivers.
At its heart lies a cave named Fanghu,
Where jade-faced immortals number beyond count.

The Lord bestowed upon them radiant jasper,
Stitched robes of orchids, sashes of angelica.
Playfully they blow cloud-harmonies down to the red dust,
Refining the five clouds to live forever.

Cinnabar deepens their ever-crimson faces,
Jade, unpolished, whitens their teeth.
Drunk, they stride the stars,
At times wielding gourds to summon gods and ghosts.

Long ago, they probed the roots of heaven and earth,
Cultivating inch-fields and foot-dwellings to lodge Kunlun.
Who knows if I am Liu Chen’s descendant,
No need to seek the Peach Blossom Spring again?

Or perhaps I am Liu Hu,
Hidden in the cliffs of Wuyi in Jianzhou.
Why seek another village of immortals?
In Wuyi’s ninth bend, it lies.

In a blink, I roam the six directions,
Seated, I journey to the formless vast.
Why pack provisions beyond the mortal coil?
Why sail far to hear the wind’s ford?

Cloud screens and misty veils—only laughter and pride,
Intimate with gibbons and cranes, dew and storks.
Behold:
The fierce wind and mighty breath cleave the azure vault,
Above, the Nine Barriers of Heaven’s Pass stand stern,
Below, the ten thousand lands, the myriad hamlets.

How long can the thread of years endure?
What use are grains of fame and merit?
If the world is not entrusted to a single millet,
Then let Mount Sumeru nestle in a mustard seed.

First, I inquired of Luojiang for straw sandals,
Already judging this body light as a leaf.
Then, drifting past Xiang and Heng,
I laughed—the rivers and mountains vast as a plate.

Now, I sit enthroned in the misty rosy nest,
Having chanted the *Song of Taiyi, the Primordial Sovereign*.
No more dreams of bamboo palaces or cassia halls—
What care I for the yellow-crowned priests of the four seas?

Last night, you sat with me, pouring osmanthus wine,
I dared not rise to dance the *Yunbin* melody.
When will we tread the clouds to Fanghu?
I long to ride the wind and follow you.

**Poem on the Lute for the High Adept Ding of Penglai**

Hutuba rode a whale to heaven,
Boya and Cheng Lian—ancient names.
In this shallow age, no Zhong Ziqi remains,
For whom shall the lute’s wondrous intent be raised?

Spring winds, spring rains fill Xiaoxiang,
You dwell in a thatched hut, bamboo walls sealed.
Within, cuckoos cry, their throats chilled,
Amid flowers, orioles roost, dreams fragrant.

A traveler descends from Li to Heng,
His breast heavy with poetic sorrow, nowhere to rest.
I beg you, brush away the crystal dust,
Steep tea, and suddenly, the lute sounds.

The adept asks me, “How do you feel?”
“I cannot bear to hear your strings.”
A spring of ten illnesses, nine from wine,
Three months scarce two days clear.

Ni Zan hums, a single tune,
The gibbon’s cry ceases, fingers pluck again.
At first, like snowmelt gurgling jade,
Then, suddenly, like rain’s rustling fall.

Within, the coiled peaks’ cry,
Swiftly shifting to the gibbon’s clear song.
First, I mistook it for Jing Ke crossing the Yi,
Then, the Xiang Consort weeping in the night.

Once, I heard *Nanfeng* played to its end,
Only the recluse of Meili understood.
Alas, the bitter apricot blossoms in the altar’s shade,
Mountains high, waters cold—the sound vanishes.

This intent of yours is not for mortal ears,
Laughing, you chant grotto hymns, jade pendants chiming.
You can make phoenixes dance down the cinnabar Han,
Clouds enfold the earth, all bow their heads to listen.

The world’s gains and losses—chickens and insects vie,
Better to herd sheep among flowers and stones.
Why fret like children, murmuring,
Waiting for crickets’ cries, sighing in vain?

You surpass them, dwelling daily in emerald haze,
The crane sleeps, no one knows.
Laughing, I ponder ancient and modern in a glance,
Playing until the moon sets over a thousand peaks.

Do you know?
On the wutong branch, a pair of swallows converse,
All things are as fleeting as windblown catkins.
The lute’s sun and moon—how could they be idle?
Would they let affairs drift like a lone wild goose?

**Inscribed on the Chonghe Pavilion: Song of the Nine Perfected of Nanyue**

Laughing, I carry the great gourd of Wei’s prince,
To witness the Emperor’s music on Dongting’s waves.
Drunk, I ride the wind to visit Guangmo,
Above the nine heavens, no Southern Marchmount remains.

I sought the Nine Perfected in the void’s depths,
Amid chaotic clouds, pavilions surge.
Long ago, the Jade Emperor summoned Chen Xingming,
Two youths blew before him on purple simurgh pipes.

The Master Yin’s Dao perfected, trailing dust behind,
First in the palace hall, then guarding with fiery bells in ranks.
White-haired Hui Du bore the surname Chen,
Yet stood on the rainbow bridge, crying to the frost hawks.

Shi You shone bright, demanding Heaven’s laughter,
Dew chimed on cold pines, moonlight gleamed pure.
None called for Zhang’s essential teachings—
Ten thousand peaks echoed with apes’ cries and night tigers’ roars.

Zhang Fu, like a pearl in youth’s glow,
Refined his form to crane-like leanness.
I now recall only Xu Lingqi,
Who rinsed and tempered the Flower Pool to bathe jade mushrooms.

At Heaven’s Pillar Peak, phoenixes soared thick,
Daily feeding golden sprouts to the white tortoise.
The jade immortal’s spirit chariot—once without term—
I imagine riding nine phoenixes in feathered robes.

Incense and flame lingered long after the Emperor’s departure,
Jade bamboo shoots, too, had nine gates, nine each.
On the altar, what immortal elder was Xian Liang?
I ask the distant void: will he return again?

At dawn in Yue, if Wu’s paths prove passable,
Come coolly here to dwell in this tower entire.

**Master Bai Yuchan of Hainan’s *Biography of the True Lord Xu of Jingyang***

The True Lord bore the surname Xu, given name Xun, style Jingzhi. His great-grandfather was Xu Mei, his grandfather Xu Yu, and his father Xu Su. The family hailed from Xuchang, men of lofty integrity who never entered official service, descendants of the Yingyang lineage. During the late Han, his father fled turmoil to Nanchang in Yuzhang, where they settled.

In the second year of Sun Hao’s *Chiwu* reign (Jiwei, 269 CE), his mother, the Lady, dreamed of a golden phoenix holding a pearl in its beak, which fell into her palm. She admired and swallowed it, and upon waking, felt movement in her womb. Thus she conceived and bore the True Lord.

Master Yuan of Gouqu Mountain and Hu Mu, Protector-General and Senior Scribe, were the True Lord’s second cousins. From birth, he was keenly perceptive, his bearing elegant and imposing. As a child, he was open-hearted, untroubled by worldly attachments. Once, while hunting, he shot a doe; the arrow struck her fawn, which fell. The mother lingered, licking her young until she too perished. Moved by this, he cast aside his bow and arrows, resolving to devote himself to learning.

He mastered the classics and histories, and was versed in astronomy, geography, calendrics, the Five Phases, and apocryphal texts. Yet he was especially drawn to the arts of Daoist cultivation and immortality, attaining profound mastery. Hearing that Wu Meng of Xi’an had received esoteric methods from the perfected adept Ding Yi, he journeyed to study under him, receiving all his secrets. With Guo Pu, he sought renowned mountains and auspicious sites for a retreat to cultivate the Dao. They found the Jin family estate on the sunny slopes of Xiaoyao Mountain in Xishan, and he moved there. This is the present Xiaoyao Blessed Land, Jade Mound’s Wanshou Palace. (The Jin family later came to be revered as deities; their story is recorded elsewhere.)

He devoted himself daily to cultivation. To this day, the Elixir Well and mortar remain. He sought no fame or rank, yet his village was transformed by his filial piety and kindness, and his peers admired his virtue and righteousness. Once, a merchant sold him an iron lampstand. That night, as he lit the lamp, he noticed the lacquer peeling to reveal gold beneath. The next day, he sought out the seller and returned it. If gifts were offered, he accepted nothing that did not accord with propriety.

Though recommended as a *Xiaolian* (Filial and Incorrupt), he declined. The court repeatedly summoned him with honors, and at last, in the first year of *Taikang* (280 CE), he reluctantly accepted the post of magistrate of Jingyang County in Shu Commandery at the age of forty-two. Upon assuming office, he admonished the clerks to abandon greed and pettiness, released prisoners from their shackles, and explained the Dao to all. The officials and people rejoiced and submitted willingly, eager to reform. His investigations were divinely perceptive; none dared deceive him.

When presiding over legal disputes, he would first instruct the litigants in loyalty and filial piety, kindness and benevolence, patience and prudence, diligence and frugality, drawing near to the worthy, distancing from the wicked, forsaking greed, and restraining violence. These teachings were recorded in full, with meticulous detail. Yet he feared that the people of the hundred *li* might not all hear them, so he selected virtuous commoners of good repute and elders of wisdom, entrusting them to exhort and guide the populace. Thus, contentiousness gradually faded until, in time, lawsuits ceased entirely.

Previously, famine had struck, and the people had no means to pay their taxes. The commandery and county enforced the law strictly, driving many to flee. The Perfected Lord then transmuted tiles and pebbles into gold with an elixir, secretly burying them in the county garden. One day, he summoned all delinquent taxpayers to the court, reprimanded them, and set them to labor in the rear garden. There, they dug up gold, which they used to pay their taxes, and so all remained settled. Migrants from neighboring regions, drawn by his virtue and benevolence, flocked to join them, and the population flourished.

Soon after, a great plague struck, claiming seven or eight out of every ten lives. The Perfected Lord applied the divine remedies he had been taught to heal the afflicted. Wherever his talismans and incantations reached, the sick recovered instantly; even those with long-standing illnesses were cured. Word spread to other commanderies, and the ailing came in droves, numbering in the thousands daily. He then planted bamboo ten *li* outside the city walls by the river, placing talismanic water within, and instructed the sick to drink beneath the bamboo—all were healed. For the elderly, infirm, or bedridden who could not come themselves, he had the water drawn and taken to them, and they too recovered. The people of Shu composed a ballad in his honor:

*No theft among the people,*
*No deceit among the clerks.*
*Our lord revives the dying,*
*No illness can withstand.*

Later, people from the lands east of the Yangtze came to draw water from Jingyang, so the Perfected Lord incanted over a vessel of water, placed a talisman within, and bade them carry it back to the riverbank. There, they planted bamboo to mark the spot, and the sick who drank from it were likewise cured. This river is now called the Shu River, also known as the Brocade Waters, and lies within present-day Gao’an County of Ruizhou.

After serving in Jingyang for many years, the Perfected Lord foresaw the coming chaos of the Jin dynasty and resigned his post to return home. Jingyang County belonged to Hanzhou; after his ascension, the imperial court renamed it Deyang in honor of his virtue and its impact on the people. Later, the county seat was moved west, and the former site became a temple, now called Jingyang Abbey.

The people of Shu, moved by his transformative influence, sought in vain to detain him. Wherever he went, they erected shrines in his honor, kept his portrait in their homes, and revered him as a divine being. On the day of his departure, those bearing provisions to see him off filled the fields. Some followed him for a thousand *li* before turning back; others accompanied him to his home, offering to serve him for life and never return. On a vacant plot near his residence, they built thatched huts, forming a settlement like a military encampment. Many even changed their surnames to his, and so the place became known as Xu Family Camp. Such was the depth of his enduring love for the people.

Once, while resting in Mulberry Grove in Xinwu, the Perfected Lord was approached by five maidens, each bearing a precious sword, which he accepted in wonder. The site is now known as Mulberry Grove Abbey. The maidens then accompanied him to his residence, where they amused themselves daily by striking their swords, their purpose inscrutable. The Perfected Lord recognized them as sword immortals and treated them with reverence, ultimately gaining the use of their divine blades. After his ascension, they concealed themselves beneath the mulberry trees, becoming known as the Bridge Tree Immortal Maidens.

Later, he and Lord Wu traveled to Songyang, where they heard of a female adept named Mistress Chen in Huangtang of Danyang County in Zhenjiang Prefecture, renowned for her mastery of the Dao. They visited her to pay their respects and inquire into the mysteries of the Way. Mistress Chen said, "You both possess innate spiritual bones, and your names are recorded among the immortals in heaven. Long ago, the Filial Piety King descended from the Upper Clarity to save the world, demonstrating the Way of filial piety. He first appeared in the home of Master Lan in Qufu County of Yanzhou, saying, *'In the later Jin dynasty, the immortal Xu Xun will transmit this Dao of mine as the leader of all perfected beings.'* He left behind the Golden Elixir Scripture, bronze talismans, and iron charters, instructing Master Lan to safeguard them until your arrival. Many years have passed. I, too, received the teachings of the Filial Piety Luminous King, with filial piety as their foundation. Now that you have come, I shall transmit them to you."

She then selected an auspicious day to ascend the altar, following the rites to formally bestow the teachings. She expounded the Way of filial piety, administered solemn vows, and presented the bronze talismans, iron charters, Golden Elixir Scripture, the Orthodox Unity method for slaying demons, the Three-Five Flying Steps technique, and all other secret formulas, entrusting them to Lord Xu. The methods of sequential clarity and the Five Thunder Rites, among others, were part of this transmission.

Turning to Lord Wu, she said, "You once served as Lord Xu’s teacher in divine remedies, but now only he has received the Way of the Filial Piety Luminous King. You should now defer to him as your master. Moreover, the *Jade Emperor’s Primordial Register* ranks you as the Prefect of the Mystic Capital, while Lord Xu holds the office of Grand Illuminator and Supreme Envoy, overseeing the registers of immortals. Your ranks differ greatly. You also govern the twelve celestial divisions corresponding to the twelve states, with Lord Xu presiding over the Xuanleng region, which aligns with the *zi* (Rat) hour and encompasses all twelve divisions. You govern the Star Chronogram state, which aligns with the *chou* (Ox) hour. From now on, Lord Xu should be regarded as the elder."

The two lords bowed in gratitude and took their leave. The Perfected Lord resolved to visit Mistress Chen every year, but she perceived his intent and said, "Do not come. I shall soon return to the imperial realm." She then took a blade of fragrant grass, cast it southward, and said, "When you return, seek the place where this grass falls and establish a shrine there. Visiting once each autumn will suffice."

The two lords returned and first searched for the fallen grass. Forty *li* south of their residence, they found it already grown into a thicket. There, they built a shrine, naming it Huangtang after her, now called Chongzhen Abbey. Every year on the third day of the mid-autumn month, they would go to pay their respects.

Earlier, while traveling to find the fallen grass, the Perfected Lord paused by a clear pond beside the road to rest, remarking, "This is a place of true tranquility."

Now the Clear-Wave Grove Resting Tranquility Abbey is that very place.

He also saw villagers preparing lavish feasts of slaughtered animals to sacrifice to the spirits, and heard them exclaim in alarm: "If our offerings are meager, the gods will grow angry and send down calamity!" The Perfected Lord said, "How dare such malevolent forces act thus?" That night, he lodged at an inn and summoned wind and thunder to strike them down, uprooting their grove of trees. The next day, he told the villagers, "The demonic shrine has been driven away—no more sacrifices are needed." To this day, the site lies in ruins, and no one offers sacrifices there.

He further saw travelers burdened with water jars, trudging long distances to draw water from afar. With his staff, he pierced the dry marsh before the shrine, causing a spring to gush forth to aid them. Even in drought, its waters never fail. This is the Purple Yang Tranquil Stone Well of Great Marsh Village.

The next day, he ascended a mountain peak and pointed to a spring altar halfway up the slope, saying, "An extraordinary creature lurks here, and in time it will wreak havoc." He then established an altar to pacify and suppress it. Now, every year during the autumn audience, the Divine Mother Shen always rests here—it is called Dragon City Abbey.

He then crossed the Xiao Shu River, now called Yellow Lake Mouth. Arriving at a riverside shop, he met its owner, a man surnamed Song, who, though poor, received him with great reverence. In jest, the Perfected Lord drew a pine tree on the shop’s wall before departing. That very day, the family’s profits doubled. Later, when the river flooded and breached the dike, the entire market was swept away—only the wall with the pine remained unharmed. The place is now called Pine Lake Market, and the Song family is venerated there with offerings.

The Perfected Lord once refined divine elixirs on Yellow Dragon Mountain in Ai City. A dragon spirit lurked in the mountain’s ravines, guarding its deep pools. Whenever it stirred, it would unleash floods to sweep away the elixir chamber. The Perfected Lord dispatched spirit soldiers to capture it and nail it to a stone cliff. The "Dragon-Nailing Stone" remains there to this day.

After completing the elixir, he offered sacrifices in the stone chamber of Immortal Ge on Mu Fu Mountain. Proceeding to Xiu Prefecture, he admired the swift currents and pure waters, so he took his divine sword and sharpened it on a stone by the stream. The stone still stands in Mei Mountain of Xiu River. Later, people built an abbey there to mark the sacred site—now called Jingyang Abbey.

Soon after, he crossed the water and ascended秀 Peak, now called Jingyang Mountain. At its summit, he built an altar to offer thanks to the Sage Emperor, then consumed the immortal elixir. Lord Hao lived nearby; south of the stream lies the immortal village called Hao Immortal Abbey, the former residence of the Perfected Lord Hao. From there, he visited the home of Elder Wu.

Passing through Xi’an County—now called Fenning—its local earth god came to pay respects. The Perfected Lord requested the territory’s records, for a malevolent creature was harming the people, and the god was concealing it. As he passed a small shrine, its deity—a spirit surnamed Mao with four brothers—now called Leaf Blessing Abbey, located four hundred paces east of the county—came to greet him, saying, "A dragon fiend is harming the people. Knowing you would come, it fled to E Marsh to hide. It will return, so I beg you to rid the people of this scourge."

The Perfected Lord followed his words, pursuing it closely to E Marsh. Along the way, he encountered three elders—now the Three Kings Abbey—who, when asked where the dragon fiend hid, all pointed and said, "We saw it crouching beneath the bridge ahead." This is now called Crouching Dragon Bridge. Arriving at the bridge, the Perfected Lord brandished his sword and shouted, startling the dragon, which fled into the great river and concealed itself in the depths. The place is now called Lower Dragon Cave. He then mobilized officials and soldiers to drive it out. The dragon burst forth from upstream and was slain. The site is now called Upper Dragon River.

Enraged at the Xi’an earth god’s dereliction of duty, the Perfected Lord sealed the shrine’s main gate, forbidding the people from offering sacrifices. To this day, the main gate of Fenning County’s City God Temple remains closed, with only a side door open. When the town suffers fires, the invocators enter and exit only through the side door, and few residents make offerings. Instead, they worship at a smaller shrine—now the Lord Xu Blessing Marquis Abbey, which receives abundant offerings and is renowned for its numinous efficacy.

Returning to the prefectural city, the Perfected Lord remarked, "This place is a vital hub of water and land routes, teeming with people—surely there must be those destined for immortality?" To test this, he mixed several grains of the elixir with other medicines and sold them, instructing buyers to take them in faith. Though many redeemed the medicine, not one attained transcendence. The Perfected Lord sighed, lamenting the rarity of those fit for immortality in the mortal world.

Hearing that a dragon was wreaking havoc in Xin Hao, he took up his sword to hunt it down. The places he passed through are now called Dragon Spring Abbey—later renamed Immortal Journey. The dragon, terrified, fled into a stream cave—now called Hiding Stream. The Perfected Lord inscribed talismans on a massive stone and composed a "Dragon-Suppressing Text" to restrain it. The inscribed stone still exists; the site is now a monastery called Yan Zhen, with an abbey of the same name nearby, forty *li* from Fengxin County.

At that time, a giant serpent dwelled in a mountain cave in the upper reaches of Haihun, spewing clouds of poisonous breath that stretched forty *li*. Any person or beast caught in its vapors was instantly devoured, none escaping. Boats on the rivers and lakes were also capsized and sunk, causing great harm to the people. Hearing of this, the Perfected Lord ascended the summit of North Ridge to investigate—now the east of Red Crow Abbey, called Meeting Immortals Peak—and indeed saw the toxic vapors filling the sky. Moved by the people’s suffering, he gathered his disciples to slay the beast.

Upon entering its territory, over three hundred residents from near and far, knowing of the Perfected Lord’s divine arts, came to plead their grievances, begging for mercy. The Perfected Lord said, "The cycles of the world bring such calamities, and the people must endure them. I have come precisely for this purpose. I vow to rid you of this serpent—I will not live in the same world as it." Soon after, his disciples arrived and joined in urging him to act.

The Perfected Lord replied, "The time must be right." He planted his sword in the ground and silently prayed to heaven. After a long while, a spring gushed forth, and a red crow flew past. The Perfected Lord said, "Now is the time." The place became known as Hour-Waiting Abbey, later renamed Red Crow Abbey. A poem from the *Zhong Xing* reads:

*Of old there was a mighty serpent, fierce and proud,*
*Jingyang awaited here to strike it down.*

Within the grotto, the immortal maiden Fang Gu convened,
While celestial marshals in heaven marked the appointed hour.
Talismanic envoys suddenly flew to the mouth of the valley,
As sword-stars crossed paths—ghosts and spirits wept in sorrow.
A thousand years hence, how many rises and falls?
Yet the boundless merit of hidden virtue knows no end.
Zhang Tianjue also composed a poem on the Sword-Planted Spring:

*Swiftly the planted sword became a well beneath the crag,*
*Waiting for the time, the midday crow stirred from afar.*
*The demonic scourge of Haihun is now utterly purged—*
*Its lingering blessings yet remain in the Seven Pacifications Chart.*

Thereupon, he advanced to the serpent’s lair, wielding his sword and deploying his *qi*. The serpent, seized with terror, retreated into its den. He then dispatched a flying talisman to summon the Earth Duke of Haihun to drive it out, but the beast would not emerge. He next called upon the Earth Lord of Nanchang to assist. The talisman fell east of the county, where an abbey was later built, named Talisman-Fallen Abbey—now known as Taihe.

The serpent emerged from its den, rearing its head over ten *zhang* high, its eyes like torches, spewing venom that blotted out the sky. The villagers all clamored and clattered to aid him. At that moment, the Perfected Lord whistled forth wind and thunder, summoning divine soldiers with a gesture, compelling the beast to submission so it could not move. Lord Wu then strode forward and trampled its head, cleaving its skull with his sword. Only then did the serpent cower and submit.

His disciples Shi Cen and Gan Zhan brandished their swords and slashed its belly, splitting it open. A smaller serpent, several *zhang* long, slithered out from within. Gan wished to slay it, but the Perfected Lord said, "It has done no harm—it must not be wantonly destroyed." The young serpent, trembling, fled six or seven *li* away. Hearing the villagers’ clamor, it turned back to listen and gaze upon its mother. The place is now called Serpent-Child Harbor, some ten *li* distant.

The disciples urged him to execute and slaughter it, but the Perfected Lord replied, "If this serpent brings harm to the people five hundred years hence, I shall return to slay it. The pine and parasol trees before my altar will serve as proof: when their branches overhang the altar and sweep the ground, that will be the time." He also foretold in prophecy: "One thousand two hundred and forty years after my departure as an immortal, within the borders of Yuzhang and the Five Mounds, eight hundred earthbound immortals shall emerge. Their

Now called Spirit-Water Terrace. After the great python was slain, its monstrous blood fouled the sword, so he ground and cleansed it, then shaved stone to test its edge. Today in Jianchang County there remain the Sword-Grinding Site and the Sword-Testing Stone.

He addressed his disciples: "Though the great serpent is destroyed, the dragon-spirit remains unpunished. That creature is spiritually perceptive and must know my intent to eliminate harm. It may lie in wait to breach the prefectural city. I shall return to the prefecture—Zhan and Cen, the two sons, shall follow me." This was in the sixth year of Yongjia.

The Perfected Lord’s Daoist arts were sublime, his renown spreading far and near. Hundreds sought to become his disciples, and though he declined, they would not desist. So he transformed charcoal into a beautiful woman and scattered her by night among the disciples’ lodgings to test them. At dawn, he reviewed them: only ten remained unstained by her, and these were the very ones who later ascended as his foremost disciples. Thereafter, whenever he roamed rivers and lakes to slay dragons and behead serpents, none but these ten followed, while the rest, ashamed, departed. Today at West Ford in Jianchang County stands the Charcoal-Woman Market, and a temple called Dawn’s Clarity.

The Perfected Lord then returned to the prefecture with the two lords, Gan and Shi, surveying the city and its precincts. There they encountered a youth of refined bearing, splendidly robed and capped, who introduced himself as surnamed Shen. His manners were earnest and respectful, his responses quick and apt—yet he abruptly took his leave.

The Perfected Lord said to his disciples: "The one who just departed was no human—he was the essence of a flood-dragon, come to test us. Though his form and bearing were flawless, a rank wind clung to him, so I feigned ignorance to lure out all his vile kind."

Following his trail, they found him in the Jiangli River, where he had transformed into a yellow ox standing on the sandy shoals outside the prefectural city. The place is now called Yellow Ox Shoal. The Perfected Lord then cut paper into a black ox and sent it to fight the beast, while ordering Shi Cen to conceal himself with a sword. As the two oxen grappled fiercely, Shi Cen struck, cleaving the yellow ox’s thigh. Wounded, it fled into a well south of the city. The well’s waters flowed horizontally, and today its mouth lies hidden beneath the southeast corner of Shanglan Temple’s wall—hence its name, the Flood-Dragon Well.

The Perfected Lord dispatched a talismanic officer to trace its tracks, discovering that it had traveled straight to Changsha, emerging from the well of Jia Yi before transforming into a man and entering the household of Magistrate Jia Yu. Earlier, the dragon’s essence had admired Yu’s daughter for her beauty and, taking the form of a refined youth, sought an audience. Yu, impressed by his talent, agreed to wed his daughter to him. The dragon bribed Yu’s trusted attendants to sing his praises, and the marriage was sealed. After several years, they had two sons. Each spring and summer, the dragon would depart alone, roaming rivers and lakes like a traveling merchant. By autumn, he would return aboard a massive raft laden with treasures—plunder from ships capsized during the spring floods. That autumn, however, he returned empty-handed, claiming to Yu that his goods had been stolen by bandits, who had also wounded his left thigh. Yu’s household lamented, and physicians were summoned to treat him.

The Perfected Lord then disguised himself as a physician and called upon Yu, who welcomed him joyfully. When Yu summoned his son-in-law to be examined, the dragon sensed danger and refused to appear. Yu rose to fetch him, and the Perfected Lord followed into the hall. There, he thundered: "Flood-dragon of rivers and lakes, you have harmed countless beings! I have tracked you here—do you think to escape? Come forth, come forth!" Cornered, the dragon reverted to its true form, coiling across the hall floor before being slain by the officers and soldiers. The Perfected Lord sprinkled its two sons with dharma-water, revealing them as young dragons, and executed them as well. Jia’s daughter nearly transformed too, but her parents pleaded for mercy. The Perfected Lord gave them a divine talisman, and she remained human.

To Yu, he said: "Beneath this dragon’s lair lies water. Your home stands over depths no shallower than a foot—all is raging waves. Flee at once, lest you court disaster." Yu’s household, terrified, relocated to high ground. Soon after, the site collapsed into an abyss, its depths unfathomable. This is today’s Zhaotan in Changsha.

The Perfected Lord then returned to Yuzhang. The dragon’s remaining allies, numerous and fearful of his wrath, grew restless. They transformed into humans and scattered through the city, seeking out his disciples. Feigning innocence, one said: "I hail from Chang’an, where my family has long revered goodness. I have heard of your master, Lord Xu, and his divine sword—might I learn of its power?" A disciple replied: "Our master’s sword points to heaven, and the heavens blaze; points to earth, and the earth splits. It commands stars to lose their course and rivers to reverse their flow. No evil can withstand it—it is a treasure of gods and sages." The dragon asked: "Is there nothing it cannot harm?" The disciple jested: "Only winter melons and gourds." Taking this as truth, the dragons transformed their entire brood into gourds and winter melons, their vines and tendrils entwined, floating in dense masses down the river, intending to drift beyond the borders.

At dawn, the Perfected Lord sensed a surge of malevolent qi. Gazing at the river, he saw the dragons’ ruse and handed his sword to Shi Cen, ordering him to tread the waters and strike. The creatures, linked like a chain, were annihilated without exception, turning the river’s flow murky. The Perfected Lord declared: "This land is riddled with dragon lairs. Without a ward, they will return to plague us, and none will be able to restrain them." He commanded spirits and gods to forge an iron pillar at the well south of the yamen, its shaft rising several feet above ground. Eight chains anchored it to the earth’s veins—this is today’s Yanzhen Palace. He intoned: "If the iron pillar tilts, the demons will rise again, and I shall return. If it stands true, the evil will be purged forever." From then on, water demons vanished from the region, and the city knew peace.

Fearing future tyrants might stir trouble, he left a prophecy inscribed on the pillar: *"When the land’s virtue surpasses man’s heart, no traitor shall arise. Even if schemers emerge, their ambitions will come to naught."* Such was the depth of the Perfected Lord’s foresight.

The following year, learning that remnants of the dragon and serpent brood had scattered into the borders of Poyang and Xunyang, he feared their return. He traversed rivers and lakes to exterminate them. At the Three Gorges of Xixiao Mountain, where caverns pierced the great river, linking Rao and Xin, he slew the dragon spirits and established Yuyang Jing to suppress them. At the bay beneath the northwestern cliff, he founded Kaihua Jing, and further erected Dacheng Jing. Beside the Jing lay the Flood-Dragon’s Younger Brother Pool, its depths unfathomable and teeming with dragon kin. The Perfected Lord eradicated them all, save one young dragon that escaped—hence the establishment of this Jing to sever its ties.

He also cast an iron talisman to seal the mouth of Poyang Lake, blocking their entry—today it lies in the river at Zhizhong Rock in Hukou County. An iron lid covered Yuan Pool in Luling, restraining their hidden lair, and he placed another talisman there. The site is now called Feifu Ridge, home to Chongzhen Temple, where one of his swords remains. The blade, a foot long, resembles jade or bronze, yet its nature eludes recognition.

The next year—Yongjia 7—he journeyed again to Changsha, then to Zhaoyang. The following year, he traveled through the prefectures of Tan and Heng, purging poisons and eliminating harm wherever he went, before returning to Yuzhang.

Before and after, he established over seventy prefectural *Jing*—all to suppress malevolent forces and avert calamities across commanderies and counties.

In the second year of Emperor Ming’s *Taining* reign, the Grand General Wang Dun, styled Chuzhong, raised troops and marched inward, halting at Yuhu. The Perfected Lord and Master Wu together sought an audience, hoping to dissuade him. At the time, Guo Pu was already in Wang’s headquarters, so they entered together through him. Chuzhong welcomed them warmly and, after drinking, asked: “I dreamed of a tree splitting the sky—what do you make of it?” The Perfected Lord replied, “It is no auspicious sign.” Master Wu said, “A tree breaking upward through the sky forms the character *wei* (未, ‘not yet’)—you must not act rashly.” Chuzhong’s expression darkened. He ordered Guo Pu to divine the matter, and Pu declared, “It will not succeed.” Displeased, Chuzhong asked, “How long is my lifespan?” Pu answered, “If you proceed with this campaign, disaster will come swiftly. But if you return to Wuchang, your years may yet be immeasurable.” Enraged, Chuzhong demanded, “And how long is *your* lifespan?” Pu replied, “It ends at noon today.” Chuzhong flew into a fury and commanded his guards to seize and behead Pu.

*The Biographies of Immortals* records that Pu had forewarned his family to prepare funeral arrangements. At the execution site, he instructed that his coffin be placed between two pines by the riverbank. Three days later, merchants in Nanzhou market saw Pu selling his garments and ornaments, conversing with acquaintances as if alive. When Chuzhong heard this, he refused to believe it—until he opened the coffin to find no corpse. Pu had undergone *bingjie* (transcendent liberation through death). Today, he is revered as the Immortal Lord of the Southern Waters.

The Perfected Lord then raised his cup and cast it into the air, where it transformed into a white wagtail. Chuzhong’s rebellion ultimately failed. Defeated, he died in remorse, his corpse later subjected to the punishment of dismemberment.

The two masters returned to Jinling and sought to hire a boat to Yuzhang. The boatman claimed no one was available to steer, but the Perfected Lord said, “Close your eyes and sit calmly—do not peek. I will navigate for you.” He summoned two dragons to flank the vessel, and they set forth. Passing Chiyang, he pressed his seal into the western cliffside to ward off water spirits; the imprint remains visible today. As the boat ascended, it soon soared over the summit of Mount Lu, brushing the treetops of Purple Cloud Peak near the Golden Palace Grotto. The two masters wished to explore the cave, so the vessel dipped slightly, its hull scraping the forest canopy with a grating sound. Unable to resist, the boatman stole a glance—whereupon the dragons abandoned the boat atop a towering peak and snapped the mast into a deep ravine. Both became iron and stone: the peak is now called Iron Boat Peak, and the mast lies in the gorge as shattered rock.

The Perfected Lord admonished the boatman: “You disobeyed my command—where will you go now?” The man prostrated himself, begging for deliverance. The Perfected Lord taught him to ingest sacred herbs, enabling him to fast indefinitely and achieve immortality. He and his companions concealed themselves in the mountain. Later, when Huan Yi governed Jiangzhou, he sent men to investigate the wonders of Mount Lu. At Purple Cloud Peak, they saw a boat in the lake, along with cranes, red-scaled fish, and two youths on white horses whose whistles carried for hundreds of paces—likely the boatman and his fellows. The two masters then rode separate dragons, one by water and one by land, reuniting at Heavenly Treasure Grotto on the northern ridge before returning to their former retreat. There, they spent decades expounding the true teachings to their disciples, no longer concerning themselves with worldly affairs. Devoted solely to cultivating the supreme Dao, they composed *Drunken Thoughts of an Immortal* and inscribed the *Eight Treasures of Admonition*:

*Loyalty and filial piety, integrity and prudence—*
*Be loyal, and you will not deceive;*
*Be filial, and you will not rebel.*
*Be incorruptible, and you will not covet;*
*Be prudent, and you will not err.*
*Cultivate yourself thus, and you may perfect your virtue.*
*Be magnanimous, and you will win the people;*
*Be generous, and you will have abundance;*
*Be tolerant, and you will embrace all;*
*Be patient, and you will find peace.*
*Treat others with propriety, and resentment will vanish.*
*All my disciples—*
*In movement and stillness, be diligent and sincere.*
*Hold these principles close, and guard your solitude.*
*Should your heart stray, the Three Officials will examine and punish you.*
*Let your village be transformed, turning toward goodness and shunning transgression.*
*Let filial piety and brotherly love flourish.*
*In daily life, respond to circumstances as they arise, no different from ordinary folk—*
*Yet where they dwell, cranes circle and sing, auspicious clouds swirl in the distance.*

Since the chaos of the Eastern Jin’s collapse, the lands east of the Yangtze had been plagued by turmoil. Yet within a hundred *li* of the Perfected Lord’s abode, bandits dared not intrude. The villages enjoyed peace, harvests were bountiful, and the people suffered no disasters. Such blessings graced the living, though none knew their source.

In the second year of Emperor Xiaowu’s *Ningkang* reign, the year *jiaxu*, the Perfected Lord was 136 years old. On the first day of the eighth month, a celestial procession descended from the heavens, with two immortals riding a palanquin, their retinue resplendent. They alighted in the Perfected Lord’s courtyard. He descended the steps to bow in welcome. The immortals declared, “By decree of the Jade Emperor, we bring you this edict.” The Perfected Lord prostrated himself to listen as the edict was proclaimed:

*“The Supreme Edict summons the Divine Youth Xu Sun, who has cultivated the supreme Dao through countless kalpas, enduring hardships and mastering all teachings. You have traversed the myriad methods and thousand gates, rescuing the afflicted, eliminating harm, and vanquishing demons. Your merit has aided the living, your name inscribed in the Jade Register. The host of immortals reveres you. It is fitting that you be elevated: you are hereby appointed Supreme Immortal Historian of the Nine Provinces and Grand Illuminator, conferred with a purple-feathered robe, a jade banner, a treasure scepter, a jar of jade elixir, and a measure of golden cinnabar. Upon receiving this decree, you shall comply.”*

The Perfected Lord bowed twice and ascended the steps to accept the edict. One immortal announced, “I am Cui Ziwen, the Jade Perfected Duke.” The other said, “I am Xiaqiu Zhong, the Primordial Perfected Minister.” With that, they invited the Perfected Lord to sit and informed him of the day of his ascension before departing in a cloud chariot.

The Perfected Lord then summoned his disciples and the village elders to announce his departure. From that day forward, they gathered at his residence morning and evening, feasting and bidding farewell, while he instructed them in the principles of performing good deeds and accumulating merit to attain immortality. He composed works such as *The Spiritual Sword Master* and left behind ten five-character, two-rhyme poems of exhortation for his eleven disciples, along with the formula for the *Great Merit Elixir of Wish-Fulfillment*, bequeathing them to those disciples who would not ascend with him.

This formula is one of the divine prescriptions from the *Ding Yi Divine Methods*. Its preparation requires first selecting an auspicious day, observing purification rites, and setting up an altar to invoke the spirits of the eighteen medicinal ingredients. Only then may one inscribe the talismans, recite the incantations for each ingredient, and compound the remedy—whereupon it cures all manner of illnesses as effortlessly as one’s wishes are fulfilled.

On the full moon of that month, a grand vegetarian feast was held, and all the villagers—young and old—were summoned to gather. At midday, music was heard from afar, and auspicious clouds filled the sky, gradually drawing near to the assembly. A dragon chariot with feathered canopies arrived, accompanied by an entourage of officials and guards. Immortal youths and maidens led the procession, while red auroras and purple vapors spread across the intersecting paths. Two imperial envoys descended once more, and the Perfected Lord stepped forward to receive them with a bow. The two immortals then proclaimed the decree:

“By the Supreme Edict, the Immortal Apprentice Xu Xun: Whereas in your past life you were guilty of greed and killing, and concealed the neglect of your ancestors’ sacrifices, your present life’s merits—reciting incantations over water, wielding talismans, healing the sick, punishing evil, and suppressing toxins—have been recorded. The Controller of Life of Mount Qian has been commanded to transmit the Golden Elixir to the mortal realm. Conceal your traces, seal your form, and return your body, household, kitchen, and all possessions to the Three Heavens. Purify yourself of filth, rise from the earth into the void, and let the Mighty Celestial Ding of the Left, along with the Flowing Gold Fire Bells, illuminate the Central Yellow. Do not be negligent in this.”

The decree concluded, and further honors were bestowed: His distant ancestor was appointed Attendant-in-Ordinary of the Jade Void; his great-grandfather, Grand Guardian of the Grand Tenuity; his grandfather, Registrar of Merits and Records of the Jade Supreme Pole; and his father, Immortal Official of the Central Marchmount. His residence was named the Left Mansion of the Immortal Court.

The Primordial Perfected Lord of Jade Truth then said, “Though your disciples are many, only six may accompany you. The rest each have their own appointed day of transcendence and may not join you.” With that, he bowed to the Perfected Lord, who ascended the dragon chariot. Chen Xun and Shi He carried the registers at the fore, while Zhou Guang and Zeng Hong drove the chariot. Huang Renlan and his clan followed as attendants, and Xu Lie accompanied his mother’s household. Forty-two members of the immortal retinue ascended together, and even their chickens and dogs soared into the sky.

The villagers, clinging to them and prostrate on the ground, wept bitterly, unable to bear parting. The Perfected Lord said, “The paths of immortals and mortals diverge, and sorrow and joy are deeply felt. Uphold filial piety and kindness, revere Heaven and Earth—what fear is there of no reward?” He left behind a bronze bell for cultivation and a stone casket, saying, “As the world changes and times shift, this will serve as a mark for future generations.”

A servant named Xu Da and his wife were purchasing rice at West Ridge when they heard the Perfected Lord was about to ascend. They rushed back, but in their haste, their cart overturned, scattering rice upon the ground—where it sprouted anew. The place is now called Overturned Cart Hill and Sprouted Rice Town. By the time they arrived, Xu Da wept and begged to follow. The Perfected Lord, deeming his fate unsuited for immortality, taught him the arts of earthly transcendence, and the couple both concealed themselves on West Mountain. The details are recorded in the *Records of Immortal Lineages*.

As the immortal procession ascended, a mortar and a chariot hub soon fell to the ground, followed by a chicken coop that landed over ten *li* southeast of the residence. The site was formerly called Chicken Coop Well and is now named Chongyuan Abbey. Several mice also fell, their entrails dragging yet unharmed—likely from having stolen and eaten the immortal elixir. Some later claimed to have seen them, taking it as an auspicious omen.

The immortal carriage soared into the distant sky until it vanished from sight, leaving only auspicious clouds and radiant auroras filling the valleys. For a hundred *li* around, an extraordinary fragrance lingered for months without dissipating.

Earlier, when the Perfected Lord returned from Jingyang, he presented brocade from Shu as a token of his transmission to Mistress Chen. She fashioned it into a temple curtain, which on this day suddenly flew away, circling the former residence before reentering the clouds. Later, when an abbey was established there, it was named *Youwei* (“Wandering Curtain”) in commemoration.

Long before, the Perfected Lord and Guo Pu had sought transcendent sites and scenic wonders, arriving at Xiwu Mountain in Yichun. Wang Shu, the son of Prefect Wang, welcomed the Perfected Lord to stay at the West Pavilion. After some time, the Perfected Lord said to Wang Shu, “I see that you are fit to receive my arts,” and secretly transmitted the immortal formula to him. He added, “This place has elegant mountains and rivers, with a sacred spring emerging south of the path, facing a grotto-heaven and overlooking the Yuan River—it is fitting for a Daoist abbey.” Wang Shu followed his advice, and the Perfected Lord inscribed a celestial seal character, *Jing* (“Tranquility”), upon the wall before departing.

On the day of his ascension, as the cloud carriage passed overhead, two azure-clad attendants descended to inform Wang Shu that the Perfected Lord had been summoned by the Jade Emperor’s edict and had come to bid him farewell. Wang Shu and his entire household bowed in reverence, praying for deliverance. The Perfected Lord leaned down and said, “Your immortal bones are not yet fully refined; you may only prolong your years.” He then bestowed a stalk of celestial thatch, saying, “This thatch has an extraordinary flavor. Planted here, it grants long life with prolonged use. Its sweetness nourishes the flesh, its pungency the joints, its bitterness the *qi*, its saltiness the bones, its slipperiness the skin, and its sourness the sinews. Blend it with bitter wine and consume it—it will surely be effective.” With these words, he departed. Thereafter, the Wang clan followed his instructions and consumed the herb, each living to a hundred years. The present Jade Void Abbey in Linjiang Commandery stands on that site, and the celestial thatch remains there.

The Perfected Lord’s companions numbered over three hundred, but those whose merits and conduct were unparalleled were the eleven Perfected Lords, including Tong Hao. *The Jade Mound Collection of the Ten Books on Cultivating the Real*, Scroll Thirty-Three, ends here.

After the Perfected Lord’s ascension, the villagers and the Perfected Lord’s clan descendant, Jian, established a shrine on the site. They inscribed the one hundred and twenty poems he had left behind onto bamboo slips, placed them in a large bamboo container, and allowed people to draw them for divination, calling them the "Sacred Lots." His bell, carriage, mortar, and pestle were all treasured and stored within the shrine. Later, the shrine was converted into an abbey and named "Wandering Canopy Abbey" after the brocade canopy.

The people of Shu in Jianyang competed to bring gold and silk, carrying bricks and shouting as they came to pave altars and wells in gratitude for his virtue, each carving their names upon them. The bricks laid by the people of Shu were only removed when the palace was renovated during the reign of Emperor Lü of the Later Shu. Some remain to this day. During the reign of Emperor Yang of the Sui, the abbey was reported in a memorial for renovation but soon fell into ruin. In the Yongchun era of the Tang, Celestial Master Hu Huichao restored it, and Emperor Minghuang bestowed particular reverence upon it. In the present dynasty, Emperors Taizong, Zhenzong, and Renzong each granted imperial calligraphy. Zhenzong further dispatched envoys to present incense, candles, floral banners, ceremonial flags, and dancing figurines. The abbey was then renamed "Jade Void," derived from the *Scripture on Salvation*’s meaning of "the Great Release, Jade Void’s soaring triumph in heaven."

The court also prohibited logging and firewood gathering on the sacred mountain, exempted the abbey from taxes and corvée labor, and appointed an official to oversee it, designating it as a place of honor for venerable ministers. Emperor Huizong issued a jade册 to confer an honorific title, with the following text for the ritual announcement:

On the seventeenth day of the fifth month, the *ding-si* day, in the second year of the Zhenghe era, the cyclical year *ren-chen*, the Emperor, in his august name, respectfully dispatched Cheng Qi of the Inner Court’s Palace Eunuch Service, inviting twenty-one Daoist priests to establish a seven-day and seven-night ritual at Hongzhou’s Jade Void Abbey. On the day of its conclusion, a grand offering of three hundred and sixty divine positions was held to invoke the Perfected Lord of Wondrous Aid and Divine Merit. Though the utmost spirit defies form and cannot be named, his virtue is manifest in humanity. Thus, we follow the signs to honor his traces, inaugurate this exalted title, and pray for his favor and eternal blessings upon this sacred land. The Emperor, in his august name, prostrates himself in utmost sincerity, awe, and supplication.

The Emperor’s decree conferring the title upon the Perfected Lord reads:

Your servant, in his august name, reverently receives the command of the lofty Perfected Ones to inaugurate and exalt his traces. Gazing upon the celestial vault, we express our devotion within this numinous sanctuary. The blessings he bestowed have become the people’s fortune, and his pure radiance has extended the prosperity of our glorious reign. Your servant, in utmost reverence and urgency, respectfully presents this memorial.

Your servant, in his august name, prostrates himself in awe and trepidation, bowing his head to the ground, and respectfully speaks.

The text of the jade册 reads:

On the seventeenth day of the fifth month, the *ding-si* day, in the second year of the Zhenghe era, the cyclical year *ren-chen*, the Emperor bows twice and declares: Heaven’s favor is abundant, bestowing grace upon the four directions. There exists a Perfected One who assists the Supreme Emperor, his majesty and virtue resplendent, bestowing blessings and peace. Yet his name and title remain unproclaimed—how can the rites of recompense be fulfilled? Thus, we command the relevant officials to examine the secret records, uncover his hidden virtues, and perpetuate them for eternity.

We reverently consider the Perfected Lord: he grasped the primordial chart, secretly aligned with the wondrous契, and from the Wei to the Jin dynasties, his glorious spirit shone. He relieved the destitute and healed the sick, upon whom an entire region relied. He vanquished demons and toxins, restoring harmony to the three *qi*. Thus, he received the celestial tally, his name inscribed in the register of immortals. Ascending beyond the celestial pole, his sacrifices endure through the ages. His temple stands majestic, his virtuous influence as if present. Now, as the sun’s brilliance shines and the imperial fortune flourishes, auspicious omens descend, revealing his hidden assistance. Through prayers and exorcisms, his responses echo, bringing prosperity to the people and peace to all things. It is fitting to bestow the most exalted title to manifest our solemn reverence.

We respectfully dispatch Wang Yong, Grand Master for Court Audiences, Compiler of the Academy of Scholarly Worthies, Prefect of Hongzhou, Concurrent Agricultural Commissioner of the Circuit, Concurrent Military Commissioner of the Jiangnan West Circuit, Defender-in-Chief, and recipient of the Purple Gold Fish Bag, to confer the honorific title: *Perfected Lord of Wondrous Aid and Divine Merit*.

May he deign to receive this august decree, bestow boundless protection, and safeguard this glorious mandate. May he illuminate the pure and radiant, and extend blessings to all living beings. Respectfully spoken.

In the sixth year of the Zhenghe era, the temple was redesignated as a palace, with the addition of the two characters *Wanshou* ("Myriad Longevities"), and the cyclical signs *jia* and *yi* were replaced with *Ten Directions*.

On the first day of the fifth month of the sixth year, at the hour of *chen*, an imperial edict bearing the cipher *Xun* was issued from the emperor’s presence, to be transmitted by the Bureau of Documents to the Ministry of Rites.

While reading in the Chongzheng Hall, We were suddenly overcome by a trance-like vision, as if dreaming: to the north of the Donghua Gate, a Daoist priest appeared, wearing a *Nine Radiance Crown* and clad in a crimson ceremonial robe. Flanking him were two youths, one bearing a sword and the other a whisk, both dressed in azure. Behind them stood two messengers in colorful Daoist attire, carrying an official seal and staff. They proceeded to the vermilion steps, bowed with reverence, and ascended the left dragon-tail staircase to the hall.

Suspecting this was no ordinary Daoist, We inquired: "Who are you, that you approach without summons?"

The priest replied: "I am Xu Jingyang, temporarily overseeing the affairs of the Nine Heavens. The Celestial Emperor has dispatched me to inspect the kingdom of *Xiquye*, and passing through this land, I observed its baleful qi. Thus, I have come to pay you a visit."

We invited him to sit and asked: "What is the nature of this affliction?"

He answered: "In Hunan and Hubei, thirty-six thousand bolts of silk tribute have sunk into the waters—this is the work of a lesser dragon. In the former dynasty, this creature was not enfeoffed as a king. During the Yongjia massacre, it tore from its mother’s womb and fled, though it had not yet harmed anyone, and so was pardoned. Now, it has become a scourge to the state. Upon my return, I shall take measures to ensure it no longer dwells between the Jiang and the Huai."

The Emperor expressed his gratitude in the dream and asked again: "I suffer from the *anxi* sores, and no medicine has cured them. Does the Perfected Lord have a remedy?" The Perfected Lord immediately took a small gourd, poured out a single pill the size of a mung bean, breathed upon it, and applied it to the sores. The Emperor felt as though flowing butter suffused his body, penetrating to the bone with a cleansing coolness. The Perfected Lord then bowed and departed. After several steps, he turned back and said: "My humble abode has long fallen into disrepair. I would be most fortunate if Your Sacred Majesty would deign to glance upon it." The Emperor awoke with a start.

Within days, officials reported that the thirty-six thousand bolts of silk tribute had indeed been capsized by wind and waves. Consulting the illustrated classics, the Emperor found that in Fennin County of Hongzhou, on Mount Mei, there was a place where Xu Jingyang had sharpened his sword. He ordered a portrait painted as seen in the dream and bestowed it upon the Chongqing Chuxiang Palace. Soon after, at the petition of the Daoist Records Office, a Hall of the Perfected Lord was constructed behind the Hall of the Three Purities. A second imperial edict was issued, commanding the Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, Xie Jingren, to proceed to Fennin County with the local magistrate and assistant officials to renovate the Jingyang Abbey using provincial funds. A decree was also granted for the abbey’s administration. On the Heavenly Tranquility Festival, one novice was to be assigned. Further, the Emperor ordered an investigation into any other sites associated with the Perfected Lord. Where no abbey existed, local authorities were to allocate official funds for construction; where abbeys stood but buildings were damaged, repairs were to be made according to regulations. If no permanent endowment existed, suitable farmland from nearby monasteries was to be transferred to the abbey for its upkeep, ensuring strict discipline. The responsible officials were to implement these measures.

Months later, the Emperor dreamed again of the Perfected Lord’s return. As before, he expressed his thanks: "Fennin is where I once traveled, and Your Majesty’s efforts in reconstruction are deeply appreciated. I have divined a site on West Mountain where my relics remain, but the dwellings are cramped and shabby, unworthy of the capital’s gaze. I hope Your Majesty will renovate them." The Emperor awoke and immediately issued an edict to Hongzhou, ordering the reconstruction of the Yulong Wanshou Abbey. A design was provided, modeled after the Chongfu Abbey in the Western Capital, to be rebuilt anew. A statue of the Perfected Lord was bestowed, along with bronze incense burners, flower vases, candlesticks, bells, and chimes. The Emperor personally inscribed two plaques for the gates and halls. The complex comprised six main halls, twelve smaller halls, three cloisters, seven gates, five pavilions, and a front hall whose three walls were painted with scenes of the Perfected Lord’s deeds and virtues. The rear hall enshrined the jade tablets, and above it stood a pavilion housing the three imperial decrees and the Emperor’s calligraphy. Flanking walls depicted the celestial procession’s ceremonial entry and exit. The abbey was enclosed by walls, and to the west of the walls, where the True Man Xu had once resided, a Daoist cloister was built to house the Daoist community.

During the Jianyan era, when the Jin invaders ravaged the lands south of the Yangtze, they sought to burn the abbey. Suddenly, water gushed from the pillars, preventing the flames from taking hold. The Jin chieftain was astonished and inscribed on the wall: *"The Dragon-Tiger General of the Great Jin, having sworn allegiance, was appointed Supreme Commander of the Marshal’s Headquarters. Upon arriving here and beholding the sacred images, so solemn and magnificent, I dare not destroy them."* Dated the second day of the first month of the eighth year of Tianhui, with the abbey’s superintendent duly informed. The inscription complete, the Jin forces withdrew.

The inscription on this crumbling wall was just being restored. In the twenty-eighth year of the Shaoxing era, ten scrolls of imperial calligraphy were bestowed, to be treasured here as a blessing for the sacred precinct.

All relics left by the True Lord are guarded by numinous beings—none may violate them. The cypress planted before the hall, its flourishing or withering, always presages the abbey’s rise or decline. Its pruned branches, steeped in decoction, cure every ailment without fail. The cinnabar well was once frequented by a divine dragon; Hu Dongzhen first placed talismanic stones and an iron pillar to subdue it. During the Tang, when Yan Miu served as prefect, he harbored deep skepticism. Once, he ordered the excavation of the site, but suddenly fierce thunder, howling winds, and surging river waves erupted, shaking the city walls. Terrified, he kowtowed in remorse, and the tumult subsided only after a long while.

Later, he forcibly took the bell used by the True Lord in his cultivation and placed it in a Buddhist temple. When struck, its sound was as dull as earth or wood. Suspecting the Daoist clergy had bound it with magic, he imprisoned and beat them, threatening execution. That night, he fell into a trance and was rebuked by a divine figure, who threatened to sever his head. Startled awake, he released the Daoists and returned the bell to the abbey. During the chaos of the Five Dynasties, the bell vanished one night, its whereabouts unknown.

The carriage hub, once sought by Prefect Xu Deng, was brought to the prefectural hall, but before he could examine it, it flew back that very night. It remained in the Song dynasty until the Jin invasion, when it disappeared without trace.

The stone casket, though cracked, could not be opened. When Zhang Shan’an usurped Hongzhou, he forcibly pried it apart. Inside the lid were cinnabar-inscribed characters: *"Five hundred years hence, the mad rebel Zhang Shan’an shall open this."* Terrified, he scrubbed the inscription, yet it could not be erased. He then concealed the lid, leaving only the base of the casket. Today, both it and the medicinal mortar remain here.

The imperial brushworks of the Three Dynasties and the True Lord’s jade tablets vanished after the Jin invasion, their fate unknown.

The True Lord’s influence extends far and wide across the lands south of the Yangtze, Hunan, and Hubei, where countless abbeys, temples, and altars have been established in his name. Some lie hidden in remote mountains, forests, lakes, and marshes, in places of extraordinary wonder. By the sands of Longsha, for instance, lies the Sword-Grinding Pool, its sheer walls of sand standing firm, never silted or blocked.

In Xinjian County lies the Lake of Lamenting Drought, where leeches once thrived in great numbers. Casting grain-like pellets of medicine into the waters eradicated them entirely, and the lake has since been called Medicine Lake. At the inn of Songhu Market, the True Lord once rested briefly in his youth; to this day, no mosquitoes or gnats trouble that household.

In Fengcheng County’s Second Hand Cave, a flood dragon entered and was sealed within by wedges of cedar wood, which remain unrotted to this day. In Fengxin County’s Hidden Creek, another flood dragon took refuge; the True Lord split a massive boulder beside the stream with his sword and inscribed a talisman to suppress it. The stone stele that marks the subdued dragon still stands.

In Jing’an County lived the Immortal Maiden Liu, named Yizhen, who had lived for centuries yet retained the appearance of a child. The Lady of the Southern Peak once praised her, and when the True Lord went to meet her, she had already ascended in flight. He left behind a treasure chariot of flowering wood, which rose into the air with the wind and descended three days later. Thus, her abbey was named Flowering Chariot Abbey; its stele remains, and it is now called Radiant Perch Abbey.

Such marvels are too numerous to recount in full. Every year, in the last month of summer, officials and commoners alike prepare incense, flowers, drums, music, and banners to welcome the small effigy of the True Lord from his sleeping hall, escorting it to their villages and communities. There, they pray and perform rites according to their wishes, seeking to dispel drought and locusts.

Several days in advance, the community leaders gather to present melons and fruit as offerings before the front hall, an act called "cutting the melon," which serves to announce the date of the welcoming ceremony. The images of the True Lord number six in total; only those in the front hall and sleeping hall remain undisturbed, while the others are welcomed and invited at will. Over the course of sixty days, the processions traverse the vast and auspicious realm, and on the eighty-first day, the people of all eighty-one villages assemble at the abbey to offer thanksgiving rites, known as the Yellow Center Fast. The rituals of the Yellow Center were transmitted by the True Lord himself.

On the twenty-eighth day of the seventh month, the immortal’s procession ascends the Five Dragons Mound to the left of the abbey. Since ancient times, this place has been forbidden to snakes and tigers, known as the Prohibited Altar. Thus, those who come from near and far to pray and perform rites travel day and night without fear of serpents or beasts. In mid-autumn, called the Pure Moon, the abbey opens from the first day of the month to receive offerings, prayers, and incense from all directions. The observances begin with the prefectural and municipal authorities, who dispatch officials bearing incense, candles, wine, silk, and written petitions. People from distant and nearby places, supporting the elderly and carrying the young, arrive by sedan chair or horseback, their shoulders brushing along the roads. Merchants seek profit with a hundred goods, performers display rare skills and marvelous feats, while teahouses, taverns, inns, and food stalls stretch in an unbroken line for over ten *li*, thronging the thoroughfares like a bustling market. This continues for the entire month.

On the third day of the Pure Moon, the immortal’s procession travels to Yellow Hall Abbey to pay respects to the Lady of the Southern Peak. The evening before, it descends from the hall to fast at Southern Repose, and at dawn the next day, the journey begins. After a brief rest at Restful Tranquility Abbey, it lodges for the night at Purple Sun Abbey. The following morning, it ascends Dragon City Altar and crosses the Small Shu River. When the True Lord first sought the flying thatch in ancient times, he crossed this river, offering two hundred coins to the boatman. The boatman repeatedly asked for more, eventually demanding a thousand, to which the True Lord agreed. Upon disembarking, the boatman returned home with the coins, only to find that two were rings, while the rest were paper money. Startled, he realized the True Lord was a divine being. To this day, when the immortal’s procession passes, boatmen ask only for two rings and dare not make further demands.

By midday, the procession arrives at Yellow Hall, where it pays homage to the Lady of the Southern Peak. The virtuous of the region gather to present offerings and feasts. The following day, the procession remains for another full day before returning to the abbey by the western route on the sixth day. Every year on the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Ascension Fast is observed. The day before, a grand rite is held, and the next day, the Yellow Lord arrives for an audience. The Yellow Lord, the True Lord’s son-in-law, often travels by hidden paths. The morning of his arrival, when he is five *li* from the abbey at Houbei, there stands a pavilion called the Robing Pavilion, where the Yellow Lord changes his attire. The abbey prepares its full ceremonial procession to welcome him through the main gate. There was once a gate inscription that read, "The front hall is called the Yellow Pavilion Gate." First, he pays his respects in the front hall with the rites of host and guest. The following day, after the offering ceremony concludes, he descends to rest at Western Hemp before returning west at dusk. Meanwhile, the merchants and residents of the market east of the abbey invariably insist on parading through the streets to seek prosperous trade, pulling and vying until they reach Dragon Mound Bridge before turning back. The saying goes: "Where the uncle-by-marriage goes, profit follows," and this has proven true time and again.

Every three years, on the day after the Lantern Festival, the True Lord’s immortal procession travels to Auspicious Sun to visit the Yellow Lord, an event called the Western Comfort. On the Lantern Festival itself, at midday, the procession first welcomes the image to the front hall, where a three-offering vegetarian feast is presented before setting out. Departing through the eastern gate, it passes south over Sacred Immortal Bridge, through Luxuriant Grove, and into Yellow Maiden Alley, then to Peaceful Hamlet. Turning aside, it enters Yuan Capital Altar for a brief rest—the altar stands beside the temple, where an abbey once stood but is now in ruins. Next, it ascends Mistress Peak, enters Yuan Immortal Abbey, and soon rejoins the post road before turning onto a smaller path. After two *li*, it arrives at Crimson Pond Abbey for offerings, where the Tomb of the Youth-Preserving Lad lies; the place was once called Verdant Life Abbey. Returning to the main road, it proceeds to Dark Mountain Head, then to the Thirty-*Li* Post, where another offering is made. The attendants take their midday meal before crossing nine ridges and nine streams, passing Dragon Mound Bridge, and arriving at Auspicious Sign, which belongs to Gao’an County and was once called Prayer Immortal Abbey. Many from Auspicious Sun come out to welcome the procession, an event called "receiving the immortal." The True Lord dismounts his chariot to feast with the Yellow Lord in the front hall. On the seventeenth day, another offering ceremony is held, and the community leaders and attendants accompanying the immortal procession proceed to the rear hall to present libations to the Immortal Maiden of the Xu Clan. This practice began in the eighth year of the Chunxi reign.

The next day, the procession returns before the fifth watch. Along the way, six offerings are made. Thousands of scholars and commoners burn incense to welcome and pay respects, while in every village it passes, men and women, young and old—sometimes numbering in the hundreds—burn incense, bow in reverence, scatter spirit money, and set out offerings. Some are moved to tears of gratitude. Whenever the immortal procession departs or arrives, the community leaders bow twice to send off or welcome it outside the main gate. For the Southern Audience, Western Comfort, and prefectural or municipal welcoming rites and prayers, the community leaders always accompany the procession. The True Lord rides in a palanquin adorned with a golden phoenix, preceded by a white horse. According to tradition, a spirit of the white horse was once worshipped half a *li* east of the True Lord’s residence, now called White Horse Pond. When the True Lord attained the Dao, the spirit volunteered to serve as his vanguard. The golden phoenix likely symbolizes the Vermilion Bird leading the way, or it may be placed atop the palanquin, aligning with the meaning of "above, the Vermilion Bird." Some claim it signifies an auspicious omen for the True Lord’s mother, but this is unlikely.

The bearers of the palanquin sing an ancient song in unison, called *Yellow Crane Tower*. Several pairs of attendants wear tall, ornate headdresses called "colorful towers," which are quite peculiar. These headdresses, over two *chi* high, broad at the top and tapering downward, are crafted from bamboo and adorned with colored silks, tied at the forehead with cloth. A Tang-dynasty Daoist, Xiong Jingxiu, once wrote: "Worldly affairs have passed to the Tang’s mandate, yet immortal songs retain the customs of the Jin homeland." Even in the Tang, such things were considered strange.

The melody of the song endures, though its lyrics have long been lost. Shou Hao has now composed three chapters to restore them. The first reads:

*"The True Lord’s merits and deeds fulfill three thousand,
The imperial decree soars through the void to traverse the nine heavens.
Even chickens and dogs follow the immortal’s kin in departure—
To this day, traces remain by the sacred border."*

The second:

*"A thousand years have passed since the True Lord left us,
Morning and evening, we burn incense and knock upon the distant dark.
We only pray for compassion to descend upon the earth,
Beseeching abundant blessings to protect all living beings."*

The third:

*"The Daoist master Chen Mu dwells in Zhouyang,
A single leaf of flying thatch marks where fragrance lingers.
The immortal’s carriage does not forget its former vow—
Year after year, it once more visits the Yellow Hall."*

The route taken must follow the ancient paths—twisting, slanting, winding, or straight—without the slightest alteration. To change it invites misfortune.

Whenever the immortal’s carriage is about to set forth, the people of the region rush to clear the old trails, erecting markers to guide the way, for these are not paths commonly trodden by the multitude. Ancient records state: In the past, the beloved daughter walked this way, and the True Lord followed her tracks to the home of Huang Jun, where he stayed for two nights before returning by the main road. His search for the flying thatch also took many winding turns, and thus the modern processions of the Southern Court and Western Patrol both retrace the same ground as in former times.

The palanquin’s movements foretell omens of weight or lightness, swiftness or slowness, safety or peril, clear skies or rain. A light burden, swift steps, smooth passage, and bright weather bode well for the region’s fortune; a heavy burden, slow steps, stumbles, or gloomy rain portend disaster. Good fortune brings bountiful harvests and peace to the people, while misfortune brings harm to men and blight to all things. Only the Western Patrol’s journey differs: its departure favors cold rain, while its return prefers warmth and sunshine—any reversal is also a sign of calamity.

Whenever the immortal’s carriage travels, it must set out before dawn and press on until dusk, traversing thatched huts, thorny thickets, and rough terrain. The retinue of local festival-goers numbers in the hundreds, yet since ancient times, none have been known to injure their feet. The only taboo is the presence of human or animal death, pollution, or filth. Incense money, clothing, food, drink, sitting, and resting—all must avoid such contamination, or sudden and violent misfortune will strike. Later, disasters of obstruction and hardship will follow, as attested by both the accounts of the ancients and the clear evidence witnessed today.

Master Bai Yuchan of Hainan’s *Accounts of the Immortals of Xiaoyao Mountain*:

**Master Wu**
Master Wu’s given name was Meng, courtesy name Shiyun, a native of Puyang. He served the Kingdom of Wu as Magistrate of Xi’an and later settled there—present-day Fennin County. His nature was profoundly filial: even as a child, he would not brush away mosquitoes in summer, fearing they might leave him to bite his parents.

At forty, he received the divine prescriptions of the Perfected One Ding Yi. Later, he studied under Prefect Bao Shuo of Nanhai and obtained esoteric methods. During the Huanglong era of Wu, Heaven bestowed upon him the White Cloud Talisman, whereupon his Daoist arts flourished throughout the lands of Wu and Jin.

During the reign of Emperor Wu of Jin, the Perfected Lord received the teachings from Shiyun, who transmitted all his secret essentials to him. At the end of the Yongjia era, when Du invaded Shu and overran its prefectures and counties, the Perfected Lord slew the great serpent. Shiyun remarked, “The serpent was the essence of Shu; with its death, Du will be destroyed.” The outcome proved his words true.

Once, when a violent storm arose, he inscribed a talisman and cast it onto the roof. A green bird snatched it away, and the wind immediately ceased.

When asked the reason, he replied: "On South Lake, a boat encountered this wind, and two Daoists aboard called to Heaven for rescue. Thus, I stopped it with this method." Upon verification, it proved true.

Magistrate Yu Qing of Xi’an had been dead for three days when Shiyun said, "The magistrate’s allotted years are not yet exhausted. I shall plead his case before Heaven." He then lay beside the corpse. After several days, he rose together with Yu Qing. Yu Qing’s younger brother, Gentleman of Writing Bao, moved by this marvel, composed *Soushen Ji* and circulated it.

Once, while crossing the Yuzhang River, he encountered a storm that disabled the boat. Shiyun drew upon the water with his white feather fan and crossed safely, astonishing all who witnessed it.

In the second year of the Ningkang era, the Perfected Lord ascended. Shiyun then returned to Xi’an. On the fifteenth day of the tenth month that year, the Celestial Emperor commanded Perfected Zhou Guang to present a decree summoning Shiyun. He then mounted a white deer-drawn carriage with four disciples and ascended in broad daylight. His residence was named Purple Cloud Manor. Today, the Peaceful Immortal Abbey west of Wuxian Village in Fennin County stands on its site.

In the second year of the Zhenghe era, by imperial edict, he was enfeoffed as Perfected Lord. The decree read: "In the blessed land of Hongdu, among the immortals of the Purple Palace, your numinous wonders are renowned. How could our honors lag behind? You early pursued the supreme Dao, awakened to its secret words, and spread its teachings, earning the title ‘Compassionate Father’ in the world. With your merits complete, you ascended to the Celestial Realm. West of the Great River, your former abode remains, where prayers are ever answered, and the people rely upon you. We bestow this new title to manifest your virtue. Our decree is just; let it be thus known. You are hereby specially enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of the Divine Ranks."

Chen Xun of Shu and Zhou Guang of Luling were both scholars of eminent families. Xun, styled Xiaoju, was broadly learned and well-informed. When Wei dispatched Zhong Hui and Deng Ai to conquer Shu and Liu Shan surrendered, Xiaoju, though still young, already harbored aspirations beyond the mundane. He entered Mount Qingcheng and studied under Master Gu Yuan, seeking the method of transcending the world. Later, hearing of the Perfected Lord’s benevolent governance in Jingyang, he hastened to his court, offering to serve as a scribe. The Perfected Lord approved and appointed him to an official post. In leading his peers, expounding teachings to transform customs, and nurturing the people, his contributions were many. Thus, he was drawn into the inner circle as a disciple, entrusted with core responsibilities, overseeing scriptures and tending the alchemical furnace. When the Perfected Lord ascended, he commanded Xiaoju to hold the reins and lead the way.

Formerly, west of Yulong Palace in Xima stood Xiaoju’s Daoist abbey, named Inheriting Immortality Manor. He planted a great parasol tree there, and the abbey faced it. In the second year of the Zhenghe era, by imperial edict, he was enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of the Orthodox Rank. The decree read: "You early served the Dao Lord with sincerity, and among his disciples, you alone were entrusted with profound scriptures. With your merits complete, you ascended bearing the banner. West of the Great River, your likeness remains, where prayers are ever answered, and the people rely upon you. We bestow this new title to manifest your virtue. Our decree is just; let it be thus known. You are hereby specially enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of the Orthodox Rank."

Zhou Guang, styled Huichang, was a descendant of General Zhou Yu. From youth, he studied astronomy and music, and in later years, he mastered the teachings of non-action and pure tranquility. Once, while traveling with like-minded companions in Yuntai Mountain of Bashu, he obtained the Han Celestial Master’s method for expelling malevolent spirits and relieving the people’s suffering. Hearing of the Perfected Lord in Jingyang, he went directly to his court, offering to serve in humble roles. The Perfected Lord accepted him and assigned him to attend to his staff and sandals. Diligent day and night, he practiced the Daoist arts without cease. Upon returning to his private residence, he obeyed without fail, then built a chamber over a hundred paces west of his home to dwell in. When the Perfected Lord ascended, Huichang rode in the same dragon-drawn carriage as Zeng Xingguo. His residence was named Proclaiming Decree Manor. During the Baoda era of the Tang, Prefect Zhou, a descendant of the Perfected Lord, renovated the manor and renamed it Proclaiming Harmony Manor. An inscribed stele remains there today; it is now known as the Great Void Abbey.

In the second year of the Zhenghe era, he was enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of Primordial Penetration. The decree read: "You early abandoned your mountain dwelling to serve the Immortal Lord. Your transformations penetrated the divine, and you attained the Dao. With your merits complete, you ascended together to the Celestial Realm. West of the Great River, your former traces remain, where prayers are ever answered, and the people rely upon you. We bestow this new title to manifest your virtue. Our decree is just; let it be thus known. You are hereby specially enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of Primordial Penetration."

Zeng Heng of Sishui and Shi He of Julu were both eminent Daoist adepts. Heng, styled Xingguo, was a descendant of Zeng Can. From youth, he was a Daoist priest, endowed with a bright and quick mind, broadly learned and versatile. He practiced the teachings of the Three Heavens Master, foresaw future events, and traversed all famous mountains and great peaks. His wondrous formulas and efficacious talismans cured all ailments. The divine man Sun Deng, upon seeing him, said: "Your bones are refined, your spirit keen, and your diligence unwavering. You shall surely become one who soars beyond the heavens. Strive onward!" Later, he withdrew to Fengcheng in Yuzhang. Hearing of the Perfected Lord’s reputation, he sought an audience, offering to attend to his towels and utensils. The Perfected Lord esteemed him greatly, transmitting all his divine methods and secret formulas. Later, he ascended in a dragon-drawn carriage. Today, the True Yang Abbey in Fengcheng County marks his former abode.

In the second year of the Zhenghe era, by imperial edict, he was enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of Divine Wisdom. The decree read: "With refined bones and keen spirit, you were endowed with exceptional gifts. Serving the Immortal Lord, you harmonized perfectly with the Dao. With your merits complete, you ascended to the Celestial Realm. West of the Great River, your altars and wells remain, where prayers are ever answered, and the people rely upon you. We bestow this new title to manifest your virtue. Our decree is just; let it be thus known. You are hereby specially enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of Divine Wisdom."

Shi He, styled Daoyang, from youth cultivated the teachings of the Dao and virtue. Entering Mount Siming, he encountered a divine man who taught him the arts of embryonic breathing and myriad wonders. Thereby, he overcame sleep and fasting, commanded ghosts and spirits, expelled malevolent entities, transmuted gold and jade, and relieved the poor and suffering. The people received his blessings, and his fame spread far and wide during the Huai and Huan eras.

Hearing that the Perfected Lord’s filial Dao and methods flourished east of the Yangtze, he journeyed on foot to his gate, entreating to become his disciple. The Perfected Lord accepted him and transmitted secret instructions. Later, he was sent back to the mountains to teach his followers. When Emperor Ming summoned him to court, his master questioned him, but he steadfastly refused to remain, ultimately returning. He served by the side of the Perfected Lord of the Handle.

In the second year of the Ningkang era, he ascended to heaven alongside Chen Xiaoju, bearing the registry and leading the procession. His former abode remains in Yuzhang City, known as the Purple Canopy Palace—now the present-day Nanchang Hall. The Fengxian Temple in Muyang County of Donghai is his old hermitage.

In the second year of the Zhenghe era, he was enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of Vast Beneficence. The decree read: *"As you trace your lineage to Donghai, your family has long been renowned for its immortal potential. You sought and found a master, thereby attaining vast beneficence. You led the dragon-tasseled procession and ascended in shared carriage. West of the Great River, your former residence remains, where prayers are ever answered, and the people rely upon you. We bestow this new title to manifest your virtue. Our decree is just; let it be thus known. You are hereby specially enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of Vast Beneficence."*

Gan Zhan, styled Bowu, a commoner from the marshes of Fengcheng, was esteemed in his village for his filial conduct.

Amidst the turmoil of the times, he withdrew to the wilds, concealing himself in the marshes, where he took delight in the arts of divine transcendence and longevity. Hearing of the Perfected Lord’s practice of filial piety and the Dao, his eradication of harm, and his benefaction to all beings, Gan Zhan journeyed to his gate and earnestly entreated, wishing to serve as his attendant. The Perfected Lord, recognizing his exceptional talent and capacity, granted his request. When the Perfected Lord ascended, he further entrusted Gan Zhan with the wondrous oral instructions of the Golden Elixir.

Later, Gan Zhan returned to Fengcheng, where he spread virtue and bestowed kindness. On the tenth day of the first month in the first year of the Dajian era of the Chen dynasty, at midday, a celestial decree descended, and he mounted a qilin-drawn carriage, riding the clouds away. Today, the Qingdu Abbey within the county is the former site where he concealed his elixir. His old residence, named Huayang Pavilion, has the Feihuang Abbey dedicated to his veneration.

In the second year of the Zhenghe era, he was enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of Refined Conduct. The decree read: *"From your youth, you followed the Daoist teachings and served alongside the Perfected Lord. You drove away demons and dispelled evil, your merits most abundant. With your refined conduct perfected, you ascended to the imperial realm. West of the Great River, your former residence remains, where prayers are ever answered, and the people rely upon you. We bestow this new title to manifest your virtue. Our decree is just; let it be thus known. You are hereby specially enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of Refined Conduct."*

Shi Cen of Pei Commandery, a stalwart of his village
Cen, styled Taiyu, was descended from Shi Shuo, who had served in the state of Wu and later relocated to Chiyu County in Jiujiang. Taiyu possessed a mighty and heroic bearing, unmatched strength, and extraordinary skill with bow and sword. When the Perfected Lord first led his disciples to slay the great serpent of Haihun, over three hundred local stalwarts gathered to assist, among whom Taiyu was present. He reverently entreated to serve, and the Perfected Lord accepted him, whereupon he and Gan Bowu regularly stood guard at his side, swords in hand.

On the twenty-eighth day of the tenth month in the second year of the Ningkang era, at dawn, a youth was seen in the eastern sky, riding a cloud and wielding a white staff, driving a blue ox to descend upon his dwelling. The youth proclaimed the Jade Emperor’s decree, and Taiyu then ascended upon a blue rainbow, borne away by the clouds. Two *li* southeast of the Perfected Lord’s residence stands an altar called the Purple Jade Palace, the place where he once dwelled. On the riverbank at Xiling Town, a stone terrace bears an abbey now named Zhide, serving as Taiyu’s viewing platform. A similar site exists in Nanchang, both used to watch for waterborne demons. The common folk mistakenly call it the Fishing Terrace.

In the second year of the Zhenghe era, he was enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of Valiant Awakening. The decree read: *"Your nature is valiant yet awakened; you found a master of your own accord and received his profound teachings, entering his inner chamber. A divine youth pointed the way to the wondrous, and you ascended to the imperial realm. West of the Great River, your former residence still stands, where prayers are ever answered, and the people rely upon you. We bestow this new title to manifest your virtue. Our decree is just; let it be thus known. You are hereby specially enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of Valiant Awakening."*

Peng Kang of Lanling, Xu Lie of Nanchang, Zhongli Jia of Jiancheng, and Huang Renlan—all, by virtue of their noble kinship, dwelled long in the master’s gate.
Kang, styled Wuyang, was nominated as Filial and Incorrupt and served the Jin dynasty, rising to the position of Left Assistant Director of the Imperial Secretariat. He secretly cultivated the Daoist arts and, pleading illness, resigned from court. He became a disciple of the Perfected Lord and even offered his beloved daughter in marriage to the Perfected Lord’s son. The old claim that Peng’s daughter became the Perfected Lord’s wife is incorrect; elders referred to her as his daughter-in-law. When the Perfected Lord, during the Yongjia era of Emperor Huai, transformed into a charcoal seller to slay the serpent, Peng Kang was still alive. By then, he would have been seventy-six or seventy-seven—how could he have taken a wife? It is also often said that the Perfected Lord’s wife was née Zhou. Upon examination, the *Eulogy on Filial Dao* contains a piece titled *Zhou’s Maidservant Answers Xu’s Mother’s Inquiry*, which is exquisite. It is likely that the lady humbly referred to herself as a maidservant, hence the term. Recent newly discovered scriptures mistakenly call her the Holy Mother.

The Perfected Lord, moved by Peng Kang’s reverent sincerity, entrusted him with all the secret essentials in their minutest detail and promptly sent him back to court. In the second year of the Yonghe era of Emperor Mu, he resigned from office and traveled south, bringing his family to reside in Yuzhang city.

He returned to the master’s gate, inquiring morning and evening, and his grasp of the Dao grew ever more refined. In the second year of the Yongchu era of Emperor Gaozu of Song (corrected from the *Zhifang* record to the second year of the Yixi era), on the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month, his entire household of twenty-six ascended to heaven in broad daylight. The present Zonghua Abbey in the prefectural city marks the site.

In the second year of the Zhenghe era, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of Latent Grace. The decree read in part: “For you have renounced fame and forsaken profit, cultivating in silent seclusion, exhausting your sincerity to serve your master and receiving the secret essentials; your merit and conduct now perfected, you ascended in flight to the imperial precincts. West of the Great River, your former dwelling still stands—its immortal chamber and sacred altar arrayed as of old, where every prayer is answered and our people find refuge. We now bestow upon you this new enfeoffment to manifest your excellence. Our mandate is just; let it be witnessed herewith. You are hereby specially enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of Latent Grace.”

Xu Lie, styled Daowei, was orphaned young and served his mother with such filial devotion that it became renowned. His mother was the elder sister of the Perfected Lord. The Perfected Lord had two sisters, and Xu’s mother was the eldest. The *Record of Enduring Love* states: “Xu Junlie and Zhongli Junjia of Nanchang were nephews of Master Xu,” confirming that Xu’s mother was indeed the Perfected Lord’s sister. Seeing her widowed state, the Perfected Lord built a chamber for her a few dozen paces west of his residence, where she could dwell. Thus mother and son daily heard the wondrous teachings of the Dao. Whenever the Perfected Lord went out, Lady Ye (Xu’s mother) would take charge of his household affairs. Immortal guests and reclusive visitors all had the chance to meet her. Master Hu’s *Eulogy on the Stone Shrine* says: “I once came here and was a guest of Lady Xu.” Mother and son both received an imperial edict from the Jade Emperor, arranging for their immortal retinue to ascend to heaven. The abbey west of the wall now stands on the site of their former home, known as the Court of Harmonious Rites.

In the second year of the Zhenghe era, she was honored with a decree as the Perfected Lady of Harmonious Repose. The decree read in part: “For you have studied the Perfected Lord’s Dao and awakened to the source of the Five Refinements; your nature serene and harmonious, your actions in accord with the great transformation, you ultimately ascended with your mother to the imperial realm. West of the Great River, your former dwelling still stands, where every prayer is answered and our people find refuge. We now bestow upon you this new enfeoffment to manifest your excellence. Our mandate is just; let it be witnessed herewith. You are hereby specially enfeoffed as the Perfected Lady of Harmonious Repose.”

Zhongli Jia, styled Gongyang and also Chaoben, was the son of the Perfected Lord’s second sister. Orphaned young, he cultivated a simple and unadorned disposition. The Perfected Lord once sighed that he possessed the bearing to receive the Dao, and so entrusted him with divine formulas to heal and save, and with wondrous instructions to command and expel. When the Perfected Lord ascended to heaven, he first bestowed upon him the gift of the Golden Elixir. On the fifteenth day of the tenth month of that year, at midday, a chariot of azure radiance and precious jade descended from heaven to welcome him. Gongyang bowed to receive the edict and ascended in the chariot. The western source of Ivory Mountain in Xinjian was his dwelling place, where the Abbey of the Vermilion Mound still stands, and the stone mortar for alchemical drugs remains. It is known as the Court of Zhong the Prince.

In the second year of the Zhenghe era, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of Universal Grace. The decree read in part: “For you have upheld the transmission of refinement and cultivation, mastering the arts of talismanic correspondence and exorcism, universally bestowing grace near and far, your merit and conduct resplendently manifest. The Perfected Lord entrusted you with his instructions, and you ascended to wander in the imperial realm. West of the Great River, your former dwelling still stands, where every prayer is answered and our people find refuge. We now bestow upon you this new enfeoffment to manifest your excellence. Our mandate is just; let it be witnessed herewith. You are hereby specially enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of Universal Grace.”

Huang Renlan, styled Ziting, was the son of Huang Fu, styled Wanshi.

Appointed as Filial and Incorruptible, he rose to the rank of Imperial Censor. Ziting possessed a spirit of radiant refinement and a disposition of profound depth. The Perfected Lord gave his daughter to him in marriage, and thus he mastered the Perfected Lord’s Dao in its entirety. When he took office as Attendant Gentleman in Qingzhou, he left his wife to serve his parents, yet each night he would return home in secret, unbeknownst to others.

One evening, a household servant reported hearing voices and laughter in the courtyard of Lady Xu. His mother questioned her, and Lady Xu replied, “It is Master Huang.” His mother said, “My son serves in office thousands of *li* away—how could he be here?” Lady Xu answered, “He has attained the immortal Dao and can traverse a thousand *li* in an instant. He warned me not to speak of it, so I dared not tell you.” His mother said, “If that is so, let me see him.”

That night, when Ziting returned, Lady Xu told him what had transpired. By dawn, Ziting had no choice but to present himself before his parents, saying, “Though I serve in a distant land, I secretly return each night to your side. The immortal Dao must remain hidden—if word were to spread, I fear it would bring calamity.” With that, he took a bamboo staff and transformed it into a green dragon, mounting it to depart.

Thus, Wanshi also came to admire the immortal Dao, becoming a disciple of the Perfected Lord and observing the rites of a student. Only Ziting’s two younger brothers, Yong and Jian, were unruly, spending their days hunting and roaming. Though their father and brother ascended by imperial decree, the two remained at their hunting grounds, declaring, “Our nature is wild and unrestrained—we are unfit for immortality. Let our brother take the whole family to soar among the clouds; allow us two to hunt deer.” Ziting sighed at their allotted fate, then broke a blade of grass and transformed it into a deer to curb their reckless hearts. Thereupon, he ascended with his parents and thirty-two kin, riding the clouds to join the Perfected Lord’s immortal procession.

The two brothers later concealed themselves in the Western Mountains. Today, the Fanggang Temple is commonly called the Shrine of the Fourth and Fifth Lords Huang. As the immortal retinue departed, a stone ball and a medicine cart fell from the clouds. The Xiangfu Abbey in Gao’an County, Ruizhou—formerly called the Abbey of the Ascended Immortal—was his former residence. Nearby lies the Isle of Lady Xu’s Fallen Hairpin.

In the second year of the *Zhenghe* era, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of the Penetrating Dao. The decree read in part: “For you have inherited the blessings of Chuping, endowed with an extraordinary nature, studying under the Dao Lord and mastering the most profound mysteries. Your merit and conduct now complete, you ascend to wander in the imperial realm. West of the Great River, your former dwelling still stands, where every prayer is answered and our people find refuge. We now bestow upon you this new enfeoffment to manifest your excellence. Our mandate is just; let it be witnessed herewith. You are hereby specially enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of the Penetrating Dao.”

Ziting’s father, Fu, also sought to become a disciple of the Perfected Lord. As he was a distinguished relative, the Perfected Lord treated him with the courtesy due a guest, and thus he was not counted among the eleven disciples. All disciples who received the teachings were permitted to transmit them to their clans, each establishing their own altars and abbeys with distinct names.

The *Great Principles* states: “The lesser abbeys and pavilions serve as conduits for the practice of universal methods, named according to the number of their adherents.”

Master Bai Yuchan of Hainan’s *Accounts of the Immortals: The Venerable Lan*

In ancient times, there was an extraordinary man surnamed Lan, named Qi. None dared address him by name, so he was called the Venerable Lan. Initially, he resided in Jiuyuan Village, Gaoping Township, Qufu County, Yanzhou. His household numbered over a hundred, all diligently cultivating filial piety. This drew the descent of a Perfected One from the Dipper, who called himself the Filial-and-Fraternal King, with the tabooed name Hongkang and the style Bozhong.

He spoke to the Venerable Lan: “The primordial *qi* is the Great Dao, and within the sun it is the Filial Dao Immortal King. The original *qi* is the Supreme Dao, and within brightness it is the Filial Dao Luminous King. The mysterious *qi* is the Filial Dao, and within the Dipper it is the Filial-and-Fraternal King. When filial piety reaches heaven, the sun and moon shine brightly; when it reaches earth, the myriad things flourish; when it reaches the people, the kingly Dao is accomplished. From the Upper Clarity onward, I have entrusted myself to mortal transformations to expound the teachings of filial piety and fraternity.”

He further declared: “In a later Jin dynasty, the true immortal Xu Xun will transmit my lineage of the Filial Dao, becoming the foremost among all immortals.” Thereupon, he bestowed upon the Venerable Lan secret instructions, the Golden Elixir, sacred scriptures, bronze talismans, and an iron charter, charging him: “On that day, you must pass these on to him.”

Master Bai Yuchan of Hainan records that these teachings were later transmitted to the female Perfected Chen of Huangtang Jing in Danyang.

The Filial-and-Fraternal King then led the Venerable Lan to wander the outskirts. Along a wild path, they suddenly came upon three ancient tombs. Pointing, he showed them to the Venerable Lan, saying: “These mark your three past liberations. The first tomb holds only the immortal robes left behind from your former liberation by corpse-release. The second is where you refined your form in the Great Yin—your body is now complete and will soon rise. The third contains only your discarded bones. You should move the path beside the tombs to prevent people and beasts from treading upon them.”

Having spoken, the Filial-and-Fraternal King ascended to heaven. The Venerable Lan then posted a notice to travelers, blocking the old road. People called him a mad sorcerer for arbitrarily altering the path and seized him to bring before the authorities. The officials detained the Venerable Lan and demanded proof.

The Venerable Lan recounted all that had transpired. The officials declared, “If this is false, you shall face punishment.” The Venerable Lan replied, “My words come from the Filial-and-Fraternal King—how could they be false?” The officials then led the Venerable Lan to the site, where they opened the tombs in his presence.

In the first tomb, they found a single yellow robe. In the second, they saw a youth with a childlike face and delicate frame, appearing as if just awakened from sleep. In the third, they beheld a set of interlocking bones. All were struck with awe. The officials took the immortal robe and presented it to the prefect, but he could not bear its weight and returned it to the Venerable Lan. When Lan donned it, he merged with the immortal from the tomb, refining his body until it became weightless and ascended. The officials, filled with remorse, prostrated themselves in apology and earnestly inquired when he might descend again to the mortal realm.

The Venerable Lan leaned down and said, “From now on, I may descend once every ten days or once every hundred days to practice filial piety and aid those lost upon the Way.” Later, the fifteen-year-old youth of Wudu and the three-year-old divine child of Danyang were both revealed to be transformations of true immortals, sent to propagate the teachings of filial piety and guide those destined for transcendence.

**Shenmu**
Shenmu, whose origins are unknown, styled herself Ying. She once dwelled in Huangtang of Danyang Prefecture in Jinling, silently cultivating the supreme Dao, oblivious to the passage of years. Elders across generations saw her, yet her teeth and hair never aged, and her countenance remained ever youthful. All called her “Shenmu,” deeming her worthy to be a teacher.

During the reign of the Great Emperor of Wu, as she walked through the market of Danyang, she suddenly encountered a boy of fourteen or fifteen, who knelt and bowed twice, pleading to become her adopted son. Shenmu said, “You are already grown—you must serve and care for your birth parents. How can you abandon them to become my son? We are not of the same kind; this does not accord with the great Dao.” The boy knelt, apologized, and departed.

A month or so later, she passed through the market again and saw a child of about three, weeping and wailing, no one knowing whose son he was. When he saw Shenmu, he clutched her robe and would not let go, crying, “Where has my mother gone? I beg your mercy!” Moved by his helplessness, Shenmu took him in and raised him. As he grew, he served her with sweet delicacies, never failing in his morning and evening duties. His heart aligned with the Dao, his conduct reached the gods, and his wisdom surpassed all. He mastered the classics and teachings, astronomy and geography, the Hundred Schools, and the Nine Streams, plumbing the profound and exploring the arcane.

As he neared twenty, Shenmu said to him, “I have long followed the true Dao. You were raised by me, and this bond is but temporary. Since you have no parents, what name shall you take?” The youth replied, “Once, the Heavenly Perfected bestowed upon me a sacred writ, appointing me the Illustrious King of Filial Dao. May I take this as my name?” Shenmu said, “Since the Heavenly Perfected has entrusted this to you, how dare I refuse?”

Later, when the matter of marriage was raised, the youth knelt before Shenmu and recited a hymn:
*“I am no mortal of this world,
But a lofty immortal of the upper realms.
My bond with you as son
Stems from a vow of old.
Through filial piety, I guide
The deliverance of all divine immortals.
That fifteen-year-old youth before you
Was also my transformed self.
Now my Dao and qi are complete—
I shall return to my true nature.
Mortals and immortals tread separate paths—
Why discuss marriage?
Why not, upon the Huangtang Altar,
Transmit the teachings to the worthy?
Once you propagate my doctrine,
My spirit shall dwell in the Three Clarities.”*

Shenmu, struck with awe, immediately established an altar and sanctuary at Huangtang, kindling incense and solemnly expounding the teachings of the Illustrious King of Filial Dao. The Illustrious King imparted to her the secrets of immortal cultivation, saying: *“You must ascend the lofty altar of the mysterious, sever ties with all factions, steal away to the hills and mounds, ingest the warmth of yang, entrust your reflection to the vast void, and still your spirit in the Garden of Mystery. Without the jeweled canopy of Wu Ying, the jade scriptures of the Yellow Elder, the True Sutra of the Grand Cavern, or the Hidden Mystery of the Seven Primes and Supreme Lord, you must not rest lightly upon the chariot of rosy clouds or gaze fondly upon the Terrace of Wen Chang. One who attains this Dao shall hear the nine phoenixes sing in unison, and the ten thousand spirits gather. Refining the body and mastering the nodes, the Eight Effulgences shall float in the sky, and the dragon chariots and tiger escorts shall roam the eight directions.”* Shenmu was to treasure these words.

Thereupon, he transmitted to her the wondrous secrets and bestowed the sacred writ. Then, bidding her farewell, he soared into the heavens. Shenmu received them, safeguarded them, and kept them secret for decades—no one knew of them.

By the end of the Western Jin, when the Perfected Lords Xu Sun and Wu Meng heard of Shenmu’s attainment, they journeyed from afar to Danyang to seek her teachings. Shenmu, knowing their names were recorded in the celestial registers and that they were destined to become immortals, transmitted to them the teachings of the Illustrious King of Filial Dao, the principles of true immortals’ ascension, the Orthodox Unity’s exorcism of evil, and the defense of the Three and Five Flying Steps. She also passed on the bronze talisman, iron charter, golden elixir, and sacred scriptures bestowed by the Filial-and-Fraternal King upon the Venerable Lan, strictly adhering to the original precepts. She further instructed the two lords on the *Celestial Register of the Jade Emperor*, the ranks of immortals, and the cosmic order, commanding Lord Xu to transmit the Dao to Lord Wu. The two lords bowed in gratitude.

As they prepared to depart, Lord Xu wished to pay homage to Shenmu each year. She stopped him, saying, “Do not come. I shall soon return to the Emperor’s realm.” She then took a stalk of fragrant grass, faced south, and cast it into the wind. The grass flew away. She said, *“When you return, seek the place where the grass fell, some tens of li south of your dwelling, and establish a shrine for me. Visiting once each autumn will suffice.”* With these words, a cloud-dragon chariot descended to welcome her, and she ascended into the heavens.

Today, at the border of Xinjian and Fengcheng counties stands Huangtang Abbey, a shrine modeled after the Huangtang Altar of Danyang, where each year on the third day of the eighth month, devotees come to pay homage to Shenmu.

**The Earth Lord’s True Official**
The Earth Lord, surnamed Jin, had a forgotten given name—some say it was Bao—and he was the seventh in his line.

The family had long resided at Jintian in the Western Mountains of Yuzhang, where they obtained official rank through tribute. Upright and incorruptible, he commanded the respect and admiration of his village. When Master Xu the Perfected and Guo Pu surveyed the land and arrived at his dwelling, Guo remarked, *“I have examined many sites, yet none compare to this. If one seeks wealth and rank, there will surely be rise and decline; but if one desires to dwell in reclusion, this place perfectly accords with the standards of immortality. Its ridges are rounded and substantial, its position deep and secluded; three peaks stand towering, while clouds encircle it on all sides. Inner and outer formations interlock, all perfectly harmonious. In assessing land, one must also assess the person—observing your inner and outer bearing, I find you precisely match this terrain.”*

Thereupon, he and the Perfected One together paid their respects to the Lord. The Lord joyfully came forth to greet them, as if they were old friends. Guo addressed him, saying, *“Master Xu wishes to establish a retreat here for cultivation and refinement, which is why I have accompanied him to call upon you.”* The Lord replied, *“I have long observed that Master Xu possesses the bearing and bones of a transcendent, no mere mortal of the dusty world. I only fear this land may be unworthy of him. If he truly has such intentions, I shall cede my entire estate to provide for his daily needs.”* Master Xu said, *“Though we have met as if by fate, to accept this without cause would be improper. Pray tell me what you require—whatever the amount, I shall comply.”* The Lord declared, *“A true man’s word, once given, is as binding as life itself—how much more so mere possessions? I am a plain and artless man, unaccustomed to written contracts.”* With that, he took a large coin, split it in two, kept one half for himself, and handed the other to Master Xu, saying, *“Let this serve as our bond.”*

The next day, he led his family to dwell in a cottage at Xilin, where he remained until his death in old age. At Yulong Abbey, there is a deity known as the Loyal and Manifest True Official of Xilin, the Earth Lord—this was none other than him. During the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the august Song dynasty, an imperial envoy was once dispatched to present incense, candles, flowers, and fruit to the Perfected One. As the envoy crossed the bridge, the Lord, clad in vermilion robes and simple boots, returned the offerings. The envoy, unaware he was a spirit, asked upon arriving at the abbey, *“Who was that official I just encountered by the bridge? Where is he now?”* Those around him replied, *“There was no one.”*

The envoy said, *“The one in vermilion robes, stout and short in stature.”* All present insisted no such person had been there. The next morning, after the envoy had ascended the hall to present the offerings and was returning, he passed by the Earth Lord’s shrine. Gazing upon it, he exclaimed in astonishment, *“The one I saw yesterday was this very deity!”* He then lit incense at the hearth, performed the rites, and marveled at its numinous power. Upon his return, he reported this to the court, and an imperial edict was issued exempting the abbey from requisitions and corvée, a grace bestowed thereby.

In the fourth year of the Jiatai era, the temple was granted the plaque *Zhaoying* (“Manifest Response”). In the third year of the Jiading era, the deity was enfeoffed as *Lingzhu Hou* (“Marquis of Numinous Aid”).

Xu Da was a servant of the Perfected One. On the day the Perfected One ascended to heaven, Xu Da and his wife happened to be transporting rice to the market—now known as Xiling Market. Hearing of the Perfected One’s ascent, the couple overturned their rice cart and rushed home. By the time they arrived, the immortal procession had already departed. The husband and wife beat their breasts and wailed, begging to follow. The Perfected One told them their merit was not yet complete and they were unfit for transcendence, but he bestowed upon them the arts of earthly immortality. The couple then secluded themselves on West Mountain, where the rice from their overturned cart took root and grew. The place is now called *Fan Che Gang* (“Overturned Cart Ridge”) and *Sheng Mi Shi* (“Sprouted Rice Market”), after their deed.

After their seclusion, they wished to remain unknown, so they changed their surname to *Niu* (“Ox”). When this was discovered, they altered it again to *Gan* (“Dry”). Both left poems for the world. Gan’s poem reads:

*Since the Bright Prefect ascended to heaven,*
*I’ve wandered the mortal realm to this day.*
*Not to hide my name among the vulgar,*
*But selling firewood and buying wine, I’ve forgotten worldly cares.*

His wife’s poem reads:

*Drunk, I dance and sing amid fallen blossoms,*
*My green silk skirt sash stained with cinnabar.*
*I come and go through the city selling herbs—*
*Only West Mountain is my true home.*

Another of her poems:

*Entering and leaving the immortal realm, I lose track of spring,*
*How would I know the world’s cold and heat?*
*My home lies only within West Mountain,*
*None but white clouds ever reach my door.*

Once, when Gan was traveling and had been away for some time, he walked alone to the altar platform and, moved by the scene, composed:

*Yesterday I wandered to the emerald peaks,*
*Where altar bells chimed amid sparse apricot blossoms.*
*The green peach trees bore my message—*
*Why have I not returned to the mortal world?*

When Xu Da and his wife heard the Perfected One was about to ascend, they desperately begged to follow. The Perfected One, citing the celestial decree, replied that the number of those destined for transcendence was already fixed, and their request could not be granted. Thus, he had arranged for them to be away in advance. Though Gan overturned his cart and hurried back, it was already too late. Even now, people occasionally glimpse them.

Hu, Zhan, and the two Wangs...

The Hu, Zhan, and two Wangs were minor officials of Jingyang County. Their given names have been lost to time. After the Perfected One had resigned his post and returned to the mountains for many years, these four, moved by longing for his great virtue, abandoned their homes and came to him, wishing to serve him for the rest of their lives. The Perfected One, pitying their devotion but knowing their fate did not align with transcendence, arranged for them to become deities after their deaths. Their shrines were established on the southeastern high peak of the blessed land, where they guard the water’s mouth and forever receive sacrificial offerings.

Master Hu the Celestial Master—his name was Huichao, styled Basu—was of unknown origin, and none could tell his age. During the Shangyuan era of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, he came from Mount Lu and dwelled at Hongjing in the Western Mountains of Yuzhang. In the Yongchun era, he wore a cloth headscarf and hempen robe, carrying a staff as he walked to Youwei Abbey. When he met his peers, he did not hold a tablet but merely clasped his hands in greeting. His beard and brows were fine, his bearing majestic, resembling a man of forty or so. Though not particularly tall, whenever he stood among a crowd, his head alone rose above the rest, and even the tallest men only reached his shoulders—hence he was called "Tall Immortal Hu." When asked his age, he would say, "Fifty-two years old." Decades later, when asked again, he gave the same answer. Yet when he spoke of the rise and fall of dynasties since the Jin and Song, he recounted every detail without error. He delighted in discussing *The Comprehensive* by Zhang Guanwen, the Jin Minister of Works, as if it were his own work. Some say that the two lords Xu and Hao once taught him the Dao of extending life, refining transformation, and transcending the Three Origins and Nine Cycles. He could summon spirits and command thunder and rain. When Tao Hongjing collated the *Supreme Clarity Scripture* in seventy scrolls at Huayang Cave on Mount Mao, the Celestial Master also participated, inscribing his name in red on the back seam—all who read it saw it. It is also said: "When I first came here, I was a guest of Mother Yu." Thus, it remains unknown to which era he truly belonged.

Wherever he encountered exposed bones and abandoned remains along the way, he would bury them all. If the land held ancient artifacts or treasures, he would excavate them just as he had foretold. As for malevolent and monstrous beings, he detested them like sworn enemies and was determined to eradicate them. At the western gate of Yuzhang, a camphorwood spirit had taken form as a one-legged deity, wreaking havoc with its eerie hauntings and luring people into licentious sacrifices. Upon seeing it, the Celestial Master rebuked it, inscribed talismans to bind it, then ordered the tree felled, piled with kindling, drenched in oil, and set ablaze. The demonic disturbances were thus extinguished, and he established an abbey on the site. Formerly called Xinguo, it now bears the plaque "Tianqing." Once, while traveling to Weiguan, he found the abbey in ruins from the early Tang. When he asked the abbot why it had not been restored, the reply was a lack of resources. The Celestial Master set off at once. Within a month, he arrived at the mouth of the Zhangmu River in Gao’an, ninety *li* from the abbey, where he had raftsmen tightly bind the logs and rest along the riverbank. As dusk fell, he cast a talisman in flight, and by midnight, a fierce storm of wind and thunder raged. By dawn, the rafts had already arrived at the abbey’s foundation. Along the route over Lingmo Ridge and through the valleys, trees were uprooted and branches snapped. He also unearthed a cache at the mountain’s base, yielding three hundred thousand coins to fund the labor and supplies.

The halls and chambers not meant for mortal habitation were all constructed by spirits and deities laboring through the night. Three wells were dug outside the gates to avert fires, and the locals called them the "Fire-Prohibiting Wells," ensuring that no fires have ever occurred since. Over time, his fame spread far and wide. Empress Wu Zetian summoned him with a rush-decorated carriage, but the Celestial Master retreated deep into the mountains and valleys. When local officials pressed the search, he had no choice but to emerge. Upon arriving in the capital, he was received at the Hall of Martial Accomplishment. The Empress inquired about immortal arts, but the Celestial Master spoke only of the Dao, virtue, and the foundations of imperial governance. Delighted, she sought to retain him in the capital, entrusting him with the task of elixir refinement. The Celestial Master declined, requesting to return to his mountain retreat. She repeatedly dispatched envoys bearing gold and jade to escort him back.

As he passed through Shanfu, she sent a letter, saying: *"Master, your Dao and station are lofty, having long transcended the mundane world—like Guangchengzi of the Xuanyuan era or the River Earl of the Han. Yet you journeyed a thousand *li* to answer the summons of the Three Rivers. At dawn, you crossed the imperial ford, and now your rainbow robes fade into the distance; by dusk, you will traverse the Celestial Ford, and your crane-canopied carriage grows ever more remote. The winds and clouds part in vain, leaving me endlessly forlorn. If, after nine refinements, you might deign to bestow a single pill..."*

The Celestial Master then refined the elixir at the ancient altar of Master Hongya, a process spanning three years. The court issued repeated edicts urging his return, and upon arrival, he was confined within the palace. He sought leave to depart, but the request was denied. One morning, he vanished without a trace. The Emperor, upon hearing the news, sighed with regret for a long while. He sent envoys bearing lavish gifts and a poem, which read:

*"O lofty one of lofty aspirations,
In mountain garb you return to the mountain home.
Far, far away, the wind and moon are heard,
Yet ever farther, veiled in mist and haze.
The azure peaks peer into the dark cavern,
The jade crucible refines the cinnabar sand.
Today, at Star Ford, I crane my neck,
Gazing toward the sacred path where you ascend."*

The Celestial Master returned to West Mountain, dwelling at Xumujing. The abbey featured a Central Gate of the Three Pure Ones and a Transverse Hall of the Perfected Lords, the latter now standing above the Pavilion of the Immortal Well’s Seal. All were built by ghostly craftsmen. The beams and rafters, stacked to the ridge, were cut with such precision that human labor might approximate, yet their upright steadiness and enduring solidity surpassed mortal skill. The inscribed plaques bore the reign title *Dayue* in vigorous calligraphy, personally written by the Celestial Master, who also painted his true likeness on the rear hall’s wall.

During his residence on West Mountain, the people revered him as their master. For a thousand *li* around, there were no epidemics, droughts, or floods; no terrors of collapsing skies or crumbling pillars. All near and far relied upon his grace.

On the sixteenth day of the second month in the third year of the *Chang'an* era, he commanded his disciples to construct a brick tomb on Hidden Dragon Ridge northwest of the Wandering Canopy Abbey, wherein were interred two *Tai Xuan* True Talismans, one Seven-Star Divine Sword, and one Numinous Treasure Staff. The work was completed in three days.

The Celestial Master, having arrayed his robes and cap, sat upon a rope-strung couch. Exotic incense filled the chamber, while clouds and cranes appeared in the air, and beyond the walls, the clamor of men and horses arose without cease. When they looked upon him, he had already shed his mortal form.

The prefectural authorities reported the matter, and the court bestowed money and silk to hold purification rites and offer sacrifices. He was posthumously titled Master of Penetrating the Real.

Master Sima Zhen of Gusu composed the stele inscription, recording the events in full detail. As time passed, the wall of the tomb began to crumble. A wandering Daoist priest arrived, who traced the inscriptions onto wooden tablets, restoring them to their former appearance. The following night, the wall collapsed, and the priest vanished without a trace.

The halls and gates were dismantled in the sixth year of the *Zhenghe* era by imperial decree for reconstruction, and today only the true tablets remain.

*The Thirty-Sixth Scroll of the Jade Mound Collection of Cultivating the Real is hereby concluded.*
