Indifferent to fame and profit, his learning bridged heaven and humanity. Serving the Song, he rose to the position of Guangxi’s Provincial Governor. Once, he encountered the Preserving Unity Perfected, who bestowed upon him the Supreme Dao, enabling him to command spirits and deities. One day, a crimson-robed official descended into his courtyard and addressed the Perfected: "The Emperor has heard of your name and now appoints you as the Six Penetrations’ Controller of Waters in the Dipper. You are to propagate the mysterious teachings and broadly deliver living beings. When your merit is complete, you shall be summoned back to the Golden Watchtower." With these words, the crimson-robed official ascended into the sky. He secluded himself on Mount Green City.

**The Azure Waters’ Thunder Abyss Perfected**, Huang Shunshen, styled Huibo.
A native of Jianning, born at the hour of Wei on the fifth day of the intercalary eighth lunar month in the Jiachen year. Precociously intelligent, he perused all books of the Three Teachings and Nine Schools. While accompanying his father on official duties in Guangxi, the Provincial Governor, the Reclusive Perfected of Eyebrow Mountain, saw him and marveled, entrusting him with all his writings.

The Master delved into mysteries and probed profundities, compiling them into a comprehensive compendium. Scholars flocked to his gate, their caps and carriages like clouds. Later, he was summoned to court, then received the imperial decree to return to the mountains. He secluded himself upon Purple Radiance Isle, becoming the preeminent master of his age.

**On Daoist Practices and Resolving Doubts**
Daoist cultivation is akin to the Confucian study of investigating things. For in practice, rectifying the mind and sincerity of intent are paramount. If the mind is not rectified, it cannot move things; if intent is not sincere, it cannot communicate with spirits. When spirit operates here, things respond there. Thus, though separated by a thousand miles, one may breathe as if face-to-face—who but the utterly sincere can achieve this?

Alas! Vast and boundless is the mind; subtly interconnected is the spirit. Yet if the mind is not preserved, it remains unclear; if the spirit is not nurtured, it lacks efficacy. Only through long preservation does clarity arise; only through long nurturance does efficacy manifest. Scholars of this world, neglecting daily cultivation, rush to act in a single moment—like drawing sweet water from a dry well or plucking rare blossoms from withered wood. I see they shall not succeed. When their qi is exhausted and their spirit startled, inviting scorn and disdain, they then blame the spirit’s inefficacy or the method’s failure—how lamentable!

Some masters, failing to grasp these profound mysteries, cling to the notion that rituals and sacrifices alone invoke efficacy, thereby misleading later generations. Consequently, disciples focus solely on offerings and sacrifices, harming creatures and wasting life. They summon wandering, food-seeking ghosts, whose numbers grow daily, forming factions. Claiming to command and control spirits at will, they do not realize that using evil to attack evil truly harms the practitioner’s own body.

From my youth, I cherished cultivation, collecting several chests of ritual texts and hundreds of seals, believing these were the extent of the methods. Yet my resolve was firm, and Heaven guided my heart. Suddenly, I encountered a perfected one who transmitted oral instructions—no more than a few phrases—and I roamed freely among all methods. Only then did I realize that generals and officials reside within the body, and the divine does not depart from the square inch of the heart. Those of noble aspirations who earnestly seek the Dao and its methods must not be ignorant of this principle.

**The Great Libation Rites of the Numinous Treasure**
When the Primal Chaos divided, it formed the Three Caverns, also called the Three Heavens, designating the Three Treasures. The Cavern of Reality is the Heaven of Pure Tenuity, the Treasure of the Dao, ruled by the Emperor. The Cavern of Mystery is the Heaven of Jade Clarity, the Numinous Treasure, and the Cavern of Divinity is the Heaven of Great Vermilion, the Divine Treasure—both governed by ministers. Thus, they reverently follow the origin of the Primordial Beginning to expound the Dao of Pure Tenuity, producing scriptures.

The Lord of the Dao of Jade Clarity of the Numinous Treasure was born in the Western Jade Kingdom of Na. From there, phoenix-inscribed decrees and dragon-script edicts were transmitted to the human world. Later, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate descended to the Left Palace Immortal Elder, responding to the era of the Grand Purity. Transforming and governing the Orthodox Unity, they passed down myriad methods—sacred and divine—forming the *Inner Essentials of the Numinous Treasure*.

Collectively called the *Great Libation Rites of the Primordial Azure*, they are practiced under the Primordial Azure Gate’s Branch Office. Also termed the *Numinous Treasure Libation Rites*, they are administered by the Yellow Register Court’s Branch Office. Additionally, they are known as the *Bureau of the Great Numinous Treasure*. The overarching institution is the *Palace of the Primordial’s Mysterious Workings*, which encompasses twenty-four bureaus:

*[Your] subordinate, [Name] of such-and-such rank, humbly states:*

I have heard that the great Brahmā’s scriptures, which deliver all without exception, reveal the means to transcend extinction and attain rebirth, and manifest the intent of the Flying Spirits. Your subordinate respectfully memorializes on behalf of [Name], an official of [such-and-such] prefecture, commandery, and county, together with the assembled faithful.

We deeply reflect upon the vicissitudes of glory and decay, the revolving wheel of life and death. Above, we knock upon the gates of heaven, that our heartfelt words may penetrate profoundly. Below, we communicate with the earthly prisons, hoping that the stagnant and bound may ascend. Humbly pouring forth our sincerest devotion, we beseech Your August Majesty. Fortuitously coinciding with the full moon and the Zhongyuan Festival, we establish a jade altar in the realm of the Perfected and open the jeweled palace of the Liao-Yang Heaven. We uphold the Yellow Register fast, perform the rites of the Qingwei tradition, and prepare for the covenant on [such-and-such] day, secretly communicating with the Six Directions. On [such-and-such] day, we formally present our bound sincerity, beseeching the grace of Your mandate. The Jade Almanac is issued, the numinous talismans proclaimed, summoning and delivering the souls of the deceased, reaching throughout the netherworld.

On [such-and-such] day, we erect the imperial millstone, establish the bureaus and tents, present memorials to the Mysterious, roll up the curtains to pay homage to the Sage, strike the golden bells in succession, and sound the jade chimes in harmony. The light illumines the Three Mornings, and the music resounds through the Nine Palaces.

On [such-and-such] day, we thrice proclaim the ritual codes, present words at the tripod, and that night offer the Jade Chapters, supplicating the imperial throne to break open the prisons, summon the deceased, bestow vestments, and enchant the food.

On [such-and-such] day, we thrice present the Green Petitions, reiterate the Mysterious Codes, and that night universally refine the sunken, stagnant, imprisoned, and suffering souls. We smelt the hun and cast the po, restore their nature and engender their Perfected, grant talismans and deliver registers, certify their fruition, and enable their transcendence and ascent.

On [such-and-such] day, at the three periods of the day, we present further memorials, refine the jade talismans, and transcend the spirits with the golden registers. We again knock upon the tablet, reiterating the purpose, and conclude by announcing the dispatch.

The following day, we dismantle the altar and disperse the assembly, manifesting our gratitude for the imperial grace. Having completed the offerings, we establish a pure libation for the High Perfected of the Three Realms, gathering extraordinary blessings of compassion. We pray for the Emperor’s ten-thousand-year reign, the Crown Prince’s thousand-year longevity, and that all participants in the covenant may equally partake in the radiant blessings.

Your subordinate respectfully invokes the wondrous qi of the myriad spirits from the Hongqing Palace. On this auspicious day, prostrating upon the earth, I humbly present the *Lingbao Jade Chapters of Flying Spirits and Ascended Immortals*, beseeching their transcendence and delivery, and await Your sacred decree.

*[Your] subordinate, with reverent trepidation, kowtows and bows his head, fasting and composing this memorial, respectfully presents it to the Jade August Presence of the Supreme Clarity Great Emperor, the Lingbao Heavenly Worthy.*

Your subordinate reverently hopes that the Heavenly Compassion of the Great Dao will grant my petition, issue the sacred decree, and transmit it to the Three Ministries. Proclaim it during the Zhongyuan Festival to the Earth Official of the Clear Void, that it may be universally announced to the Three Realms and pervasively demonstrated to the Ten Directions. Deliver and uplift the participants, and offer salvation to the distant and recent deceased, both within and beyond the lineage—ancestors, parents, and all related spirits. May all the sunken and stagnant souls of the netherworld, by virtue of this Dao-power, equally attain transcendence and ascent. Humbly beseeching Your boundless grace, we all receive the vast favor.

Your subordinate, daring to offend Your Heavenly Majesty, trembles with fear, constrained by heaven and pressing the earth, prostrates and submits. Respectfully memorialized.

**Vermilion Talisman of Renewal**
*Inscribed in vermilion on yellow paper*
Minister [Name]

**Heart Mantra**
*Hong cheng ming.*

**Talisman of the Dao of the Great Tenuity**
Minister [Name], kneeling in reverence before the Bureau,
declares: The earnest words I have memorialized have reached the imperial throne.

The ranks of the Perfected Officials of the Luminous Primordial Balance Hall of the Jade Clarity, whom I previously summoned,
shall return within if they were within, and return without if they were without.
When later summoned again, let all proceed according to precedent.

This rite of prostration and invocation is commonly employed in regular offerings,
but it is not used in the Nine Audiences of the Yellow Register.

**Form of the Blue Petition**
During the Tianbao era of the Tang, wooden prayer tablets were replaced with plain petitions written on paper.
In the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song, blue paper was adopted, hence the name "Blue Petition."
The significance of the pure and the blue—both rooted in primal origins—must not be overlooked.

The text of such petitions should not exceed sixty or seventy characters,
and phrases like "I humbly reflect" or "prostrating in thought" are not to be used.
This is the standard format for memorials, strict and solemn.
The petition should first state the aspiration, then directly present the matter at hand.
Parallel phrasing and couplets are to be avoided,
for while they may ease recitation, they obscure the meaning of the text.
Moreover, parallelism often leads to redundancy, compromising concision and clarity.

The principle states:
The form of a petition should be substantive rather than ornate,
unadorned rather than refined,
plain rather than florid,
true rather than false,
direct rather than circuitous,
persuasive rather than verbose,
modest rather than coarse,
pure rather than turbid,
upright rather than deviant.
Concise and sincere, it may then move heaven and earth,
stir gods and spirits,
ascend directly to the celestial bureaus,
and elicit an immediate response.

Those who violate this shall be held accountable by the officials of the Bureau of Transgressions and the Enforcers of the Law.

**On Tablets and Registers**
The merits of tablets and registers extend even to the netherworld, though they cannot be fully recounted. The case of Zhang Lihua stands as particularly luminous evidence. Records state: upon reciting the scripture nine times—precisely at the moment of repentance—one ignites the tablet and memorial, confirming that the submission of the tablet should occur at the culmination of the meritorious deed.

Recently, some have taken to burning the *Salvation from Suffering* talisman at the outset of the memorial, believing this liberates the deceased from hell. Yet this is unsound. For the extraction of the soul has its own documents, and the white tablet should be proclaimed at the time of transmission, allowing the deceased to ride the power of the ritual’s merits, the vows, the precepts, and the repentance for renewal. Only then, after offering the tablet and proclaiming below, are the sins pardoned and grievances released by the Ten Directions, enabling true liberation from hell and ascent to the Vermilion Palace.

Thus the scripture states: *"When the beings of the Nine Dark Hells hear the Northern Emperor’s broad entreaty, their hearts generate remorse and they seek deliverance. Only then does the Heavenly Worthy expound the precepts and bestow the talisman."* This is especially reliable.

Moreover, reciting and inscribing talismans is no arduous task. One who can inscribe the twenty-four faces may commit them to memory, for the meaning of talismans and incantations aligns. Let one attempt this, and they will know these words are not false.

Proclaimed to the towering mountains, stabilizers of the myriad spirits, saviors and guardians of the numinous.

With reverence, for [Name] of [Place], on this [Day] of the [Month], at the appointed hour of [Celestial Stem/Branch].

We, [Names], have conducted the Ritual of the Numinous Treasure Great Fast and Offering, from [Start Date] to its completion and dispersal on [End Date]. Now that the Dao rites are concluded, we present this tablet to [Mountain], beseeching the gods and immortals to grant eternal life, deliverance from the world, and flight to the Upper Clarity.

O Perfected Ones of the Five Peaks, most sacred and numinous, we implore you to erase our records of sin and inscribe our names in the Nine Heavens.

We request your presence at the sacred mountain, conveyed by Golden Dragon couriers.

Executed on the [Day] of the [Month] in the year of Tai-sui, at [Hour], by the titled servant [Name], at [Mountain] and [Grotto-Heaven], proclaimed for hearing.

**Earth Tablet**

**Earth Tablet**

We hereby announce to the Earth Sovereign below, to the Nine Ramparts and the Three Hundred Sixty Thousand [Spirits], commanding them to pacify and secure.

The prayer remains as before. We beseech the gods and immortals.

O Central August Nine Lands, Yellow Spirits of Wu and Ji, Five Emperors of the Earth Mansion, erase our records of sin and names of transgression. We request your presence at the Central Palace, where this tablet shall be inscribed upon the Great Mystery.

Bound with golden knots and white tokens, conveyed by Golden Dragon couriers.

Executed in the year of Tai-sui, [Month], as before, proclaimed for hearing at the Central Palace of the Earth Mansion within the residence of [Name].

**Water Tablet**

We hereby announce to the Water Palace, its courts and pavilions, dragon pools and myriad spirits, to assemble and deliver salvation.

The prayer remains as before. We beseech the gods and immortals.

O Grotto-Heavens of the Three Origins, Nine River Water Emperors, Twelve River Sources, the Jiang, He, Huai, and Du [Rivers], and the Great Spirits of the Vast Ocean, erase our records of sin and inscribe our names in the Nine Heavens.

We reverently proceed to the Water Mansion, conveyed by Golden Dragon couriers.

Executed in the year of Tai-sui, [Month], as before, proclaimed for hearing at [Name] Pool or [Name] River.

---

After the tablets are announced and burned, the talismans and prayers are to be offered.

**Earth Pacification**   **Zhang River**   **Divine Mountain**

At the outset of a transcendent’s cultivation, tablets are first presented to the Three Mansion, beseeching the erasure of past transgressions and the recording of merit—hence the invocation of the gods and immortals. Former worthies, upon concluding the altar rites, would reaffirm their vows through the Fast, a practice most excellent.

The tablets are made of hibiscus wood to signify purity of intent, and borne by Golden Dragons. The tablet’s length and breadth should match the dimensions of a hollow-bottomed wooden stand, upon which it is placed. The dragon rests within the hollow to bear the tablet. Some place the Earth Mansion tablet with the dragon seated to guard the dwelling—a vulgar notion. How could a seated dragon convey the tablet?

Blue silk substitutes for severed hair: for each tablet, twenty-four feet are used to bind the dragon. Each of the Three Mansions has its prescribed number of loops. Twenty-one golden knots are prepared, seven for each tablet, tied upon the silk as the dragon’s bridle, symbolizing steadfastness.

Jade disks are added to express reverence, for rites demand precious offerings. The Heaven Mansion’s disk is round and blue; the Earth Mansion’s, square and yellow; the Water Mansion’s, black and six-pointed, reflecting the number of water’s completion.

In accordance with the reverent petition, as decreed by the Primordial’s descent:

The Primal Abyss unfolds in clarity,
The Dao stirs the primal breath in gasping rhythm.
Jianluo and Leiluo,
Celebration holds the catalpa’s ascent.
Vast and profound, the gaze reaches its limit,
The foundation laid in simplicity and balance.
Tranquility pities the knowing of equality,
Radiance dazzles the abyssal valley.
The fullness of Dharma aligns with the Dao,
The paulownia’s splendor roams in flourishing light.
The pearl of clarity gathers the host,
Joyous elders ride the auspicious clouds.
The silent garden extends its vines,
Playful qi ascends the celestial realm.
Feathers take form in the moon’s shadow,
Orchids and magnolias stretch across the wilderness.
The resplendent season unfolds in grandeur,
The courtyard high, immortals thrive in glory.
The capital traverses the mysterious radiance,
Life’s ascent rises in majestic vigor.
Clouds spread the immortal waves,
The homeland approaches in boundless expanse.
Swift jade hastens the rosy dawn,
Reverently offering to the Dragon’s Nephew.
The Nephew ascends in spiritual communion,
The skin weighed with purple blossoms.
Pine clouds in solemn stillness,
Inverted orchids and magic herbs connect.
Descend and receive this decree.

Let this be proclaimed and heard.

The Azure Mystery’s Cinnabar Steel illumines the Thirty-Two Heavens,
Jade Grace radiates light through the Thirty-Two Heavens,
Together they revolve through the Great Clarity of the Twenty-Eight Heavens,
Uniting the Dao to summon the flourishing spirits of the Three Hundred Sixty Divine Kings,
The Three Origins, Three Realms, seas and mountains, Ten Great Grotto-Heavens,
Thirty-Six Lesser Grotto-Heavens, Seventy-Two Blessed Lands,

Preserving their divine consciousness whole,

Where the Jade Calendar reaches:
The four lights of Heaven shine bright,
Purple clouds revolve in spirals.
The Eight Assemblies of Auspicious Skies,
Divine winds stir the dust.
Sun and moon spill their radiance,
Five stars pour forth their essences.
Heaven and earth merge in misty essence,
Fragrant incense flows and scatters.
Rivers and seas grow still,
Mountains and peaks conceal their clouds.
The Five Sufferings are all dissolved,
The Three Paths pardoned and absolved.
The Nine Dark Realms cease their trials,
The long night opens its bonds.
The blind and deaf regain sight and hearing,
The six afflictions all healed.
Earth’s treasuries unlock,
Gold and jade reveal their forms.
White bones grow black,
Rotten remains return as humans.
Dragons and unicorns leap in joy,
Birds and beasts take flight in gladness.
The Three Realms know eternal bliss,
Mankind and spirits stand in awe.

This day of great celebration,
Ten thousand kalpas are renewed.

Respectfully performed for [Place] and [Name], on behalf of [Matter], to establish the altar rites and observe the fast with reverence. The divine mandate is invoked to open the Nine Dark Realms, amass merit in abundance, and universally bestow deliverance.

Having already submitted the memorial to the Celestial Court, proclaimed it throughout the Three Realms, and made it known to the earthly bureaus, we now reverently await the descent of the Primordial Decree.

**Void—Mystic Abyss—Heaven and Earth—Penetrating Purity—**
**All Forms of Life and Transformation—Subtle Dao—Perfected Truth—**
**Flying Spirits Never Perish—Assembled to Attain Immortality**

This original script of the True Seal is universally proclaimed to the Three Realms and made manifest in the Ten Directions. By virtue of this convergence, we summon the twelve hundred flying immortals of the celestial vault, the myriad coalesced stars and constellations that govern the cosmos, the true deities of the earth and the divine marshals of Fengdu. Rooted in the foregoing, all assembled here recommend the submerged souls and wandering spirits to come at the appointed time to the fast altar, to listen to the scriptures and hear the Dao.
