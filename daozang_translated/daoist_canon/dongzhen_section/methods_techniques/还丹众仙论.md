**Preface to *The Assembly of Immortals on the Cyclically Transformed Elixir***
By Yang Zai, the Recluse of Baofu Mountain

The cyclically transformed elixir begins with the Flowery Pond. Within the Flowery Pond, divine water is born. Pure and numinous above and below, it is serene, luminous, and still. As the divine water transforms, it becomes as white as frost, called the White Metal and Yellow Sprout. Next, the essence of the Three Yangs is introduced, boiled with water and refined with fire. After nine revolutions, it becomes a purple powder, called the Purple River Chariot. Mercury is then added to the River Chariot, undergoing another nine revolutions to produce true gold, called the Golden Duke. When the Golden Duke unites with mercury, metal and water meet, refined through nine further revolutions to form the cyclically transformed elixir. Those who ingest it attain longevity; the aged revert to youth; illnesses vanish of themselves; the mortal becomes immortal—naturally undying.

The cyclically transformed elixir requires direct oral transmission of the secret formulas to recognize lead and mercury. Lead is true lead; mercury is true mercury. Lead is not black tin; mercury is not liquid silver. Lead is the essence of lead; mercury is cinnabar mercury. When lead and mercury unite, the Yellow Sprout is born. The Yellow Sprout is the ancestor of the cyclically transformed elixir and the foundation of the great medicine. The *kan* trigram’s lunar lead conceals the true tiger; the *li* trigram’s solar mercury conceals the true dragon. When dragon and tiger meet, *wu* and *ji* form of themselves. The *kan* water generates metal; the *li* fire generates wood. Naturally, the four images are complete, and the five phases are unblemished.

The cyclically transformed elixir is metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Metal is the tiger; wood is the dragon; fire is the Vermilion Bird; water is the Dark Warrior; earth is the convergence of the four images. It does not employ worldly gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, salt, alkali, ashes, or frost. The cyclically transformed elixir is lead and mercury. Lead, receiving water, has no fixed form; mercury, receiving fire, attains numinosity. From nonbeing, being arises: true lead is transformed by water, and true mercury is formed by fire.

As for true lead and true mercury, the divine water of the Flowery Pond, the Azure Dragon and White Tiger, the Yellow Sprout and White Snow, the River Chariot and the divine chamber—since ancient times, these cannot be understood without oral transmission. I am a man of Xihe in Fenyang. From my youth, I loved the Dao. After more than thirty years, I met an enlightened master and received oral transmission of the secret formulas. Only then did I comprehend the principles of the elixir scriptures, penetrate the profound and subtle texts, witness the truth of creation, and grasp the marvels of ascent and descent. On the eighth day of the eleventh month in the fourth year of the Huangyou era of the Song, I had leisure to compile essential passages from various elixir scriptures into one scroll, entitled *The Assembly of Immortals on the Cyclically Transformed Elixir*, in the hope that it may await those of like aspiration.

**The Assembly of Immortals on the Cyclically Transformed Elixir**

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning said:
In the profound and obscure, the pure and still Dao;
In the dim and silent, the ancestral void of Great Emptiness.
The nature and essence are serene, abiding in nothingness;
The physical form is utterly quiescent, one with true emptiness.

He also said:
Before the separation of the undifferentiated chaos, the true unity was contained within.
Once the true unity divided, the clear and dark became heaven, the turbid and dark became earth.
The darkness of the true unity ascends and descends, inhaling and exhaling without cease.
From the darkness, essence is born: the essence and *qi* of heaven are the sun, moon, and stars; the essence and *qi* of earth are lead and mercury.
Lead is the lunar essence; mercury is the solar soul.

The Lord of the Dao said:
The solar soul and lunar essence are the marrow of the cyclically transformed elixir.
Obtaining the yin darkness, it becomes the White Sprout and cinnabar;
Obtaining the yang darkness, it becomes golden cinnabar.
When golden cinnabar enters the five viscera, it disperses like mist and rain, permeating the four limbs.

Lord Lao said:
The external elixir arises amid the divine water’s inquiry;
The internal elixir arises amid the dharma water’s juncture.

He also said:
Red lead and black lead are the head of the great elixir.
Red lead entering black is true gold.
Extracting the essence from red lead and the marrow from black,
When skillfully employed, the red-black medicine is unparalleled.
Using red to enter black ensures longevity;
Using black to enter red makes one a celestial immortal.
Both red and black are called the cyclically transformed;
Black can transform, but red takes precedence.
By the side of Liang Mountain near the Hangu Pass,
Lord Lao carved these words into stone.

Shennong said:
Cinnabar and mercury are the essence and *qi* of the sun and moon.
When in the sun, it is called radiant cinnabar—
The essence of the Great Yang.
When in the moon, it is mercury—
The essence of the Great Yin.

*The Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Nine Cauldrons* said:
Lead does not travel alone; if it moves, it must have a companion.
When carefully employed, lead and mercury share a single origin,
Able to generate golden blossoms, called the beautiful golden blossom.

The Supreme Sovereign said:
The plain and light are despised by the world;
The flowery and granular are prized by the world.
*Geng* and *xin* in equal measure,
Melted and fused together.
The emergent male and female medicines,
Refined in the upper nest.
Hard and soft as one body,
Nothing compares to this truth.

Lord Mao marveled and said:
Within yin there is yang; within yang there is yin.
Cold and heat oppose each other; the tiger roars and the dragon sings.
Azure, black, red, and white each reside in their own direction.
If they are misaligned, the guiding principle is lost.
Yang acts as minister; yin becomes sovereign.
Attend to the subtle shifts, and the heavenly Dao will naturally flourish.

He also said:
Within the cyclical there is no elixir; within the elixir there is cyclical return.
Without lead, the elixir cannot form;
The cyclically transformed elixir is born from lead.

He also said:
White Snow Powder, Golden Sprout—
Without mastery, do not boast idly.
People of this age do not recognize the true Yellow Sprout,
Knowing only to identify lead’s yellow blossom.
The blossom is but a dead thing;
How can it lead one to the immortal’s realm?

The Divine Chamber marveled and said:
Heaven and earth are mysterious and yellow;
Lead and white form the frame.
The divine chamber above and below
Does not depart from its original text.
Examine the harmony of six and one,
Proceeding in unison with the above.
When empty, it becomes a thief;
When full, it defends itself.

The Three Terraces and Five Peaks follow the strongest path of refinement.
Those who awaken attain it; those who lose it fall into madness.

Longshu commented:
Thirty catties of yellow dragon and black essence,
When fired without flight, are most divine.
The furnace’s base is small, its mouth two fen wide,
Above opens a starry path to the Celestial Ford.

Thus, the White Tiger serves as the brain,
The Yellow Sprout as the root.
After one cycle of cultivation,
It yields yellow silver.

Master Yin Zhen said:
When Gold Flower is thrice refined and nine times tempered,
It is called Old Yin—cast it into a crucible.
If a practitioner completes this crucible,
The cinnabar clouds and azure skies are not hard to reach.

He also said:
To obtain the Yellow Sprout, first ignite lead.
If Ren does not flee in the fire,
How can Gui form a union?
The hen incubates her eggs until the days are full;
When the cicada matures, its shell parts naturally.

*The Golden Tiger Formula of Ma Mingsheng* states:
Black lead transforms into the Yellow Sprout,
Within it, the number nine repeated ninefold.
Its changes are but three kinds;
When refined to the Purple Yang Palace,
Gold has no place to rest.

*The Golden and Azure Disquisition on Doubts* says:
When mercury obtains the Gold Flower,
Their forms become akin—
Dragon and Tiger unite,
Thus forming the cyclically transformed elixir.
When Gold Flower obtains gold and silver,
Their forms become supreme treasures.
These two matters cannot be heard of lightly.
If one speaks of Gold Flower, it is but the Yellow Sprout.

*The Hundred Questions Treatise* states:
A true person forms gold and silver with medicine—
Must one seek cinnabar as the mother?
If one must create golden treasure,
What harm is there in having the mother?
Dead mother is true silver;
Before returning to the mother’s body,
How can this not be principle?
Apart from the Yellow Sprout as supreme medicine,
Other medicines are difficult to subdue.
There is no false mercury,
No true asafoetida.
No other substances enter the Yellow Sprout’s body—
Mercury, moved by the essence of the Five Phases,
Receives the qi of true yang.
When the year’s elixir is complete,
The bones stand firm and the spirit is whole.
If mercury is thus subdued,
How can one not become immortal?
If there are杂 impurities,
It cannot be accomplished.

*The Heart Mirror of Cyclically Transformed Elixir* says:
Lead contains the five colors,
Mercury emits the three flowers.
When the two unite as one body,
It is called the River Chariot.
The world is deluded by it,
Exhausting their wealth and families.
Those who attain the formula
May tread the clouds and mist.

It also says:
Mercury has the flaw of sinking at the waist;
It must obtain the essence of true lead.
If one does not recognize the essence of true lead,
After kalpas of refinement,
One will ultimately achieve nothing.

Master Yuanyang annotated:
If white gold is to be subdued by fire,
The resonance lies within a foot’s distance—
It must be an oral formula,
Difficult to transmit in writing.

*Wei Boyang’s Five Categories* states:
The cyclically transformed elixir fundamentally relies on lead as its root.
When the root is formed, the sprout grows;
When the sprout grows, mercury is subdued;
When mercury is subdued, the elixir is complete—
It is not an external thing.
Those who cultivate the elixir
Must not use worldly gold and silver.

*The Secret Record of the Golden Elixir* says:
Simply use nine-times-refined lead essence as the divine chamber,
Within which nurture the golden water,
Temporarily borrowing the power of lead’s qi.

Hu Gangzi said:
All immortals do not speak of this one ingredient.
Without transformation,
It is not truly complete.
Like nine-times-refined lead essence subdued by fire,
If one has not obtained it for consumption,
Eating it would cause immediate death.

*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* writes:
When divine immortals create gold,
They do so to consume it themselves,
Not for the sake of wealth and nobility.
Divine immortals’ silver may also be consumed—
It is not counterfeit.

*The Treatise on the Kinship of the Three* states:
The golden elixir cannot be formed with many medicines;
After ten thousand refinements, it still cannot be subdued by fire.

The Classic says:
Cinnabar can be made into gold,
The River Chariot can be made into silver.
Silver is instantly formed,
And when formed, it is true.
Attaining this Dao,
One may become an immortal.

*The Secret Record of the Golden Elixir* says:
Lead’s nature is white but inwardly red;
Cinnabar’s nature is red but inwardly white.
They become watery clouds and frost-like snow—
All are the qi of heaven and earth.
When made with medicine,
They are no different from the real.

*The Three Envoys Formula of the Great One* states:
Within lead there is a child—
No need for the three yellows.
Fire is the same as this;
Moreover, it creates the Yellow Sprout.
Within the sprout there is a child—
No need for the mother’s obstruction.
Within the child, the mother transforms;
Child and mother are thus the same.
The world calls it the Gushing Spring Repository—
This method is not falsely transmitted.
Remember the three yellows,
But do not speak of the one black.

Rihua Zi said:
Yellow lead subdues black lead,
White mercury is sagely and profound.
The western marsh meets the southeast,
The eastern palace’s matron is wise.
They marry following the sun and moon,
Transforming the Dao to verify immortality.
After nine refinements, the elixir’s radiance shines,
And one lives long without counting the years.

He also said:
Spiritual lead is the lord of mercury,
Spiritual mercury is the minister of fire-lead.
Lead and true mercury—
These are the essentials of the yellow and white.

*The Great One’s Elixir Book* says:
Take eight ounces of true lead to make a vessel,
Call it the divine chamber.
Coat it with burned borax,
Add one catty of mercury,
And refine it with water and fire—
No external repository is needed.
Then, from the mutual subjugation of water and fire,
The Jade Smile Child is born,
Possessing the five colors—
It is called Purple Tooth Cinnabar.
Its forms have twenty-four kinds,
But only those resembling mounds and tombs are unfit—
Discard them in the eastern flowing waters.

*The Divine Mercury Treatise of Hu Gangzi* says:
Refine lead essence into yellow earth,
Use the yellow earth to make a repository,
Within which nurture flying frost to form the elixir.
Earth becomes the River Chariot,
Ready to be used as a cover or base.
Before the various elixirs are complete,
The River Chariot cannot be used—
Using it would be without merit.

*Master Yin Zhen’s Five Categories* says:
If lead is used to gather flowers,
Lead loses its qi.
If it gathers essence,
Lead loses its bones.
The Yellow Sprout—
The Three Powers are complete,
Bone and flesh do not separate.

A song says:
Mercury is a single ingredient without other things.
First it is flesh, then it becomes bone.
When bone and flesh follow one another, they endure forever;
From this, the River Chariot has no end.
Like a person giving birth to a son or daughter,
The parents remain clearly present—
This illustrates that the true gold’s original source remains.

If one fails to grasp the principles in this text, one will ultimately gain nothing.

*The Scripture of the Flowery Pond* states:
To combine gold and silver is the fixed method.
Mastering the transformations of metals and minerals,
Simply introduce the medicine into the Flowery Pond to subdue mercury,
Which dies at one’s touch—all within a single day.
What difficulty could there be?

Yet examine the twelve Flowery Ponds:
Their rising, descending, advancing, and retreating—
With only the dissolving brine,
One can still subdue mercury.
How much more so with gold, silver,
And the twelve hours?

The gold-fermented and silver-fermented River Chariot subdues mercury.

*The Commentary on the Scripture of the Hidden Talisman* says:
Within true lead lies mercury, called the Tiger;
Mercury is known as dead mercury.

An ancient immortal said:
To make mercury die, first let mercury die.
Thus, dead mercury within lead becomes Earth.

The mercury within cinnabar is living mercury.
In refining the elixir, one must know the three mercuries acting in unison.
Without knowing the three mercuries,
Even if one understands ten thousand methods,
There is no path to transcendence.

One must know the three mercuries—mercury, mercury, mercury.

*Master Yin Zhen’s Exegesis on the Three Elixirs* says:
Boiling and refining require no fixed number;
Washing and steeping have no set method.
Entering the crucible demands knowing the number,
The true words open the gate of fire.
The gate is distinguished by fire-timing;
The primordial qi is hard to discern.
Embryonic breathing governs the Flowery Pond,
And the adept enters the gate of fire.
If no gate is missed or misapplied,
One returns to the body of embryonic breathing.

*The Treatise on the Three Ways Unified* says:
Cinnabar first transforms into mercury,
Mercury second transforms into snow,
Third into sand, fourth into earth,
Fifth into lead—lead is gold.

The scripture says:
A single thing contains five hues,
Forever serving as the immortal’s bounty.

*Master Yin Zhen’s Exegesis on the Three Elixirs* says:
Within cinnabar lies the immortal adept,
Who harmonizes the red glow to turn it white,
Subduing fire with yin without losing its original form.
Its body also becomes white, called White Horse’s Tooth.
Used thus in the primordial four images,
It attains the undivided Water.

It also says:
The primordial qi resides entirely within the Purple Palace,
Where the divine-transforming elixir is nurtured.
This is like a person formed within the mother’s womb,
Unconsciously growing over ten months into a complete being—no different.

If one masters the Purple Palace,
One already bears the title of immortal.
The Purple Palace has three forms:
Some complete in a month, some in a day, some in a year—
Using mercury and sulfur to subdue fire.

The second is the Golden Crucible,
Where lead powder subdues fire over a year.

Where the original qi departs,
From Wood fire is born,
And fire returns to Wood—
This mirrors the Green.
Green is Water; Water meets Fire,
And Fire, through the flourishing Green Wood,
Condenses the qi into essence,
Resembling malachite.

First harmonizing malachite,
Like gathering the spring’s third month’s yang harmony and darkness,
And moving through the pitch-pipes,
One can bring forth the arising of all things.
If malachite is harmonized in the elixir,
It is like the pitch-pipes of yin and yang—
The great creation of the original spirit’s three elixirs.

The formula says:
The primordial Five Phases’ ancestor is malachite on the day of Jia.
Malachite is the essence of Wood,
Essence becomes the agent, the agent becomes qi,
Qi becomes sinew—also called yang within yin.
Yang is the sun’s soul,
The soul is the sun’s essence,
Essence is yang,
Yang is the father.
The father’s afterbirth transforms into white liquid,
Which hardens into white ice—
This is yang within yin.
Yang becomes bone;
From qi, white liquid is born,
And the white liquid naturally has four names.

The world does not realize malachite is fire
And mistakenly uses malachite.
First is Water;
Mercury is the qi of flesh,
Qi becomes blood,
Blood transforms into hair,
Hair into skin and the body’s frame—
By the third month, form is known;
By the tenth month, birth occurs,
With two additional months for bathing.

*The Three Palaces’ Lead-Controlling Formula* says:
Simmer lead into cakes to make golden flowers,
Gather the cakes into the furnace to refine nine-times sand.
Gold and Water harmonize with level clam powder;
Mercury’s liquid and yellow pulp—
The path is not distant.

Originally, only mercury is the celestial Water;
Gold born in Lishui is the River Chariot.
If one plays with common lead, one misleads the world—
Water and Earth support each other as one family.

Another *Yellow Sprout Song* says:
Seeking immortality, seek the Yellow Sprout;
One must recognize the true lead flower.
Only what forms naturally
Can become golden sand.
Ingesting one pill after repeated refinement,
One soars into the clouds and mist.
Beyond the words of heaven and earth,
Everywhere are immortal abodes.

It also says:
The natural Yellow Sprout blooms red flowers,
Wu and Ji transform into golden sand.
Born within the mysterious yellow and autumn stone,
Yet people do not awaken to seek the golden flower.

It also says:
To make mercury die, first let mercury die.
If mercury does not die first,
How can mercury die?
Mercury controls itself;
Self-control leads to spiritual communion.
If one uses various杂 substances,
From beginning to end, nothing true is achieved.

The Green Dragon faces the White Tiger,
The Vermilion Bird connects with the Dark Warrior.
The four lie in separate directions,
Yet each contains and protects the others.
From beginning to end, they are naturally close,
Never failing to watch over one another.
If you obtain the Purple River Chariot,
You will ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

It also says:
Heaven-born natural things,
Who can fathom their spiritual workings?
If one can stabilize the three cinnabar fields,
They will gleam with the five colors.
At the sight of fire, ghosts vanish;
Meeting Earth, they can reverse course.
True fire is not necessarily red;
True lead is not black.
Though the world values gold and silver,
Their ultimate principle is hard to subdue.
The four yellows and eight stones,
In the end, lack sufficient qi.
Though the Maiden is gentle and weak,
Ten thousand cannot obtain one.
I possess the five spirits’ timing,
Their majestic radiance most wondrous.

Water seeks to flow due east,
But I raise my sword to block the north.
The Green Dragon tries to flee,
But the Yellow Dog pounces on its head.
Drinking qi, we become one family,
Swallowing voices, not daring to weep.
Gradually turning to ash and dust,
Yin and yang alternately subdue each other.
Forming the Purple River Chariot,
Drawing out the poison of yellow gold.
It can save the suffering of death and illness,
Restoring youth and a jade-like complexion.

Embracing the One, maintain serene harmony,
With mind obscured, sever all cravings and desires.
Ingest but a single *dao-gui*,
And colored clouds shall bear your feet aloft.

It is also said:
To use lead, one must blend it with mercury,
Two families unite as bride and groom sing.
Refined to the Purple River Chariot, it shakes the earth,
White clouds accompany as cranes pass by.

It is also said:
Green Dragon and White Tiger merge as an embryo,
Ten months of gestation, only then does it fully open.
This is the true oral formula of lead’s sprouts—
Where in the world can one seek the Three Powers?

It is also said:
The market brims with yellow sprouts, yet none find their home,
The world scorns them, reducing them to dust.
Though nobles and ministers recognize the numinous medicine,
Greed alone obscures and confounds them.

Master Yuanyang states:
The profound subtleties of the Five Phases are hard to know,
Dragon hides, Tiger conceals—within Kan and Li they dwell.
The arts of returning elixir number in the hundreds,
Yet the most wondrous requires the Golden Flower Pool.

It is also said:
Lead and mercury cannot be relied upon as one,
The secret of the Golden Elixir—even sages know it not.
If one uses mundane lead and mercury from the world,
Year after year, with fire they contend in vain.

It is also said:
True Yin and True Yang are the true Dao,
Yet they lie before your eyes—why seek them afar?
The common crowd year after year refines divine cinnabar,
Sometimes seeing blue and yellow, they deem it fine.

It is also said:
The nine-fold refined cinnabar marks desire’s end,
Only when the furnace opens does the elixir’s flower bloom red.
Transformed by water and fire, all becomes earth—
Where then can one find the Golden Duke?

Master Peng marvels and says:
Black lead enters the crescent moon,
At the hour of Zi, it naturally disperses.
Above, it bears the green creek’s sand,
Below, golden flowers appear.
Raised eastward, then rising west,
Coming and going, seizing the opportune moment.
For a long while, hands do not cease,
Black lead scatters the green sand.
Fierce fire roasts without pause,
As it circulates, it transforms into yellow flowers.
Green sand quenched into ceruse,
Yellow flowers become red lead.
Though the world sees it all,
None grasp the difficulty it entails.
A myriad refinements are not easily achieved,
What one ingests must endure long peace.

Master Yin received the Green Elixir and marveled, saying:
Nüwa refined stone into five hues,
Soaring to the Great Veil as a canopy of splendor.
Within the azure void, the yin wheel is born,
Sulfur and wood’s essence can pair.
The Human Sovereign refined silver to attain longevity,
Joining Li with Zhen to complete the Five Phases.
Twelve months traversing the nine-fold cycle,
The Golden Elixir is truly the essence of wood.
The Golden Elder’s two characters are the water of Kan,
Flying into Gen’s palace, never to rise again.
Yin and yang form substance, naturally from the east,
All affairs must return to Wu and Ji.
The supreme Dao of heaven and earth must not be transmitted,
Gold and silver are my Green Elixir’s children.
Know well that the Most High is beyond thought,
Yin Xi received Nüwa’s record.

The *Song of the Golden Elixir* says:
Though Dragon and Tiger bear two names,
Their root and origin arise from one center.
If one seeks the method of the Returning Elixir,
Simply nurture metal’s essence with wood’s essence.

It is also said:
The wondrous principle of true emptiness is clear,
Hidden within lead, its name does not appear.
Discern the yellow sprout when it ought to emerge,
And know the White Tiger is destined for long life.

It is also said:
Silver serves as the outer frame, containing three things,
Gold acts as the embankment, receiving the Five Phases.
Best is the secret of the Flower Pool’s divine water—
Yet people do not understand, and ten thousand fail to succeed.

Master Zhang the Celestial says:
Mountain stone gold and silver, hard in nature and hotly toxic,
When made into liquid gold, are difficult to complete,
Like glue or paste, unfit for ingestion,
They consume one’s marrow.
But if medicinal gold is made into liquid,
Its path must flourish,
Yellow and red as water,
Ingested, it soars to the heavens.

The *Three Essays of the Pottery Altar* states:
White gold, from the northern water’s midst,
Transforms its form and substance.
Through forging and refining,
It is cultivated into the Great Elixir.
The water’s essence never ceases,
Thus it is said to dissolve into water.

The *Golden Casket Jade Book* states:
If it encounters divine water,
Black and white separate.

The *Golden and Azure Fire Mirror for Ingesting Medicine* states:
Ziming binds into the golden spirit’s coffer,
Able to transform the body’s hue to azure and purple.
The twenty-eight constellations align with heaven’s heart—
This is true lead, capable of transmuting into water.

Master Zheng transmitted to Ge Zhichuan, saying:
There is a thing, there is a thing,
It can be great, it can endure.
Gathered before the silkworm’s feeding,
Used after the fire’s transformation.
Bearing broth from above to pour below,
It irrigates the empty cauldron, receiving all.
Sun and moon revolve,
Five phases lie in wait.
The moth’s wind swiftly stirs,
Golden juice does not flee.
Water irrigates it,
From being to non-being.
Fire burns it,
From non-being to being.
White powder accumulates like snow,
Yellow butter congeals into golden pairing.
Lifting and overturning, intent on blackness,
Reversing decay and decrepitude.
Is it gold? Is it stone?
Heaven’s years, earth’s longevity,
Ever turning without cease,
Spirits hasten, ghosts gallop.
No attachment to words,
The secret lies in heart and mouth.

The *Secret Essentials of the Great Dao* states:
The Great White Star of Venus is the essence of metal.
Receiving the moon’s po, containing the earth star’s qi,
Its inner color is yellow—this is the Golden Flower.
The moon’s qi’s influence is po, po belongs to water,
Thus it obtains the qi of metal and water,
Corresponding to the northern Chen star,
And generates lead.
The Year Star is wood.
The sun’s hun, the essence of water’s blackness.
Its hun is red fire.
Fire generates wood,
Corresponding to the black of Mars,
And generates cinnabar.
Cinnabar internally contains wood’s yin qi,
Thus it has mercury.
Mercury is called the Green Dragon,
The Green Dragon belongs to wood.
The Chen star is water.
The essence of water,
Transmitting the qi of the Great White metal,
Flowing essence corresponds to earth,
And receiving the moon’s po, it generates lead.
Thus lead is born of the Golden Flower,
The Golden Flower has five colors,
Called the yellow sprout.
The qi of the water constellation descends upon wood,
And generates malachite.
The Mars star is fire.
The essence of fire,
Obtaining the black of the wood star,
And transmitting the sun’s hun,
Flowing essence enters earth,
And generates cinnabar.
Hun belongs to fire,
Born of wood,
Internally containing yin, it generates mercury.
Fire generates earth,
Earth contains true yang,
Generating realgar,
Its flavor is sweet.
The Saturn star is earth.
Receiving the qi of the fire and earth constellations,
Containing true yang, it has realgar.

Thus do the Five Stars transmit and receive the essence of the sun and moon, circulating and generating one another, naturally aligning with the Dao. The sun’s true name is the Father of the Dao; the moon’s true name is the Mother of the Dao. Venus is called the White Tiger; Saturn is the Curved Array; Mercury is named the Dark Warrior; Jupiter corresponds to the Azure Dragon; Mars is the Vermilion Bird, its black essence flowing through the Five Stars.

A poem says:
*The Great Elixir must be the yellow sprout,*
*Lead and mercury transmit from one house.*
*Cultivation’s order clearly understood,*
*Then naturally one attains the Golden Flower.*

The Golden Flower’s *gen* crucible follows the method,
Diligently refine for me the yellow sprout.
This is the profound secret of the Great Mystery,
Attained through cultivation, one rides the clouds and mist.

Master Mingdao, discoursing on the Flowery Pond, says:
*Yin and yang alternate, birthing south and north,*
*Lead-water and mercury-water emerge from lead.*
*Comprehending these four wondrous principles,*
*Only then does the Flowery Pond’s red and black intermingle.*

*The Golden Mercury Formula* states:
*Lead arises truly from within lead,*
*Brought forth, it binds cinnabar’s flowing essence.*
*The Golden Flower tames mercury, the pheasant subdues the sparrow,*
*Transforming into the Reverted Elixir—a most extraordinary affair.*

*The Water-Fire Diagram of the Golden Elixir* says:
*To recognize cinnabar, test it with fire—*
*Smokeless, deep purple, that is the Reverted Elixir.*
*Worldly folk know not the true Dragon and Tiger,*
*Mistaking the yellow sprout for two separate things.*

Meng Can says:
*Focus the mind to fathom the Mystery’s origin,*
*Once awakened, profound mechanisms seem effortless.*
*Before speaking of the Elixir’s return to the grotto,*
*First discuss the divine transformations aiding the mortal realm.*
*Fleeting life—abandon glory and rank,*
*In this world, one must inquire of Creation’s workings.*
*Attempting to tame Dragon and Tiger in vain,*
*Alas, how time ages the countenance.*

He also says:
*First bind lead and mercury into cinnabar,*
*Nurturing them as one household.*
*Not toward the ash pool for white liquid,*
*How could strict red transform into the yellow sprout?*
*The golden radiance shines brightly, worthy of cherishing,*
*The jade medicine gleams, even more praiseworthy.*
*Seal tightly, then re-enter the crucible,*
*Lest yin’s darkness harm the essence.*

*The Posthumous Formula of the Perfected Sovereign* states:
*The Reverted Elixir has inner and outer methods,*
*Each with its Three-in-One technique.*
*The inner Three-in-One is the Elixir medicine,*
*The outer Three-in-One serves as assistance.*

The Hermit of Changbai Mountain says:
*Huainan refines autumn stone,*
*The Yellow Emperor extols the Golden Flower.*
*Autumn stone is not stone,*
*The Golden Flower is not a flower.*
*Flower refined within autumn,*
*Stone blossoms in spring.*

Another formula says:
*Autumn stone is true lead,*
*The Golden Flower is the yellow sprout.*
*The yellow sprout does not leave lead,*
*From lead, its essence is drawn.*
*Mother and child dwell together,*
*As if in an immortal’s abode.*

*The Hidden Canon of Jia* states:
*These two substances use vessels yet do not,*
*Use form yet do not.*
*Only then is it mercury within mercury,*
*Lead within lead—knowing this, there is no confusion.*

*The Stone Wall Record of Sun the Perfected* says:
*A thousand classics, ten thousand discourses speak no falsehood,*
*Only that black gold lies before your eyes.*
*Those who gather without following the proper directions,*
*Complain that immortals refuse to transmit the Way.*
*Gather lead’s essence, refine cinnabar,*
*Within ten days, the River Chariot appears.*
*The River Chariot is but black gold wrought,*
*Quicksilver is the path of the Reverted Elixir.*
*Without black gold and quicksilver,*
*One wastes spirit and energy, aging in vain.*

*The Stone Wall Record of Mount Hua*:
*The Three Yang Sacred Stones vie in merit,*
*Only Mysterious Essence is the great unifier.*
*Refining the Great Yang exhausts its strength,*
*Then naturally the Crone does not journey west.*

*The Exegesis on the Three Elixirs by Lord Yin the Perfected* says:
*Students of the immortal’s path, fortunate to encounter sacred teachings,*
*If bestowed by Heaven, do not forget Heaven’s grace.*
*If one betrays Heaven, Heaven will not long tolerate such evil.*
*If gods and humans grant it, one must not betray them,*
*But honor and serve them with reverence and offerings.*
*If obtained from the Yangtze, Huai, or Ji rivers,*
*One must not forget the dragon pools, water wombs, and the creatures born of moisture.*
*If obtained from mountain forests or stone chambers,*
*One must not forget the land spirits of those places,*
*And must also honor them with offerings.*
*If learned from a human teacher,*
*One must not betray that teacher,*
*But revere them as parents, serving with devotion.*
*As long as the seeker’s heart does not stray from the Dao,*
*They will move Heaven and Earth,*
*All spirits and transformations will follow the path of goodness,*
*Never falling into evil ways.*
*The seeker’s heart must remain as it was at first.*
*The one who transmits the Dao must not:*
*First, betray Heaven’s grace;*
*Second, deceive the principles of the gods;*
*Third, fail their teacher.*
*If one’s words, trust, conduct, and integrity are lacking,*
*Even if they consume the medicine, they will surely die.*
*Why? Without virtue, consuming the Golden Elixir rots the five viscera.*
*Transmitting it to the unworthy brings calamity upon descendants.*

It also says:
*August Heaven has no favorites,*
*Yet transforms all through rectification.*
*Humans have no root,*
*But the Dharma-body’s four qi serve as their root.*
*The root arises from the heart,*
*The heart has no root,*
*Yet takes my nine-times-cycled Divine Elixir as its root.*
*Thus all methods find their root in the medicine.*

*Master Lü’s Orthodox Yang Chapter* says:
*The Crone dwells in the south,*
*By her side, six yang are born.*
*In the Toad Palace, jade liquid is brewed,*
*At the Kan Gate, nectar is refined.*
*Past immortals consumed it,*
*Now it comes for me to taste.*
*A single cup extends ten thousand ages,*
*Beyond the world, the spirit soars.*

He also says:
*Suddenly grasping the principle of the yellow sprout,*
*Yin and yang are endowed by Nature.*
*Within the Qian-Kun furnace, it is refined,*
*In the sun-moon crucible, it is decocted.*
*Wood yields the life-prolonging mercury,*
*Metal stews the life-extending lead.*
*Whoever understands this Dao,*
*Instantly reverts to youthful countenance.*

Yi Xuanzi says:
*True lead and worldly lead,*
*Purity and turbidity—earth debates heaven.*
*If mixed with ash and sand,*
*How can propriety and justice be complete?*
*The deluded become lowly ghosts,*
*The attuned become exalted immortals.*
*Should you ask of its form and substance,*
*Within the mysterious, it is even more mysterious.*

He also says:
*The Crone is called Brightness,*
*Her body dwells in the grotto chamber.*
*In water, hear the tiger’s roar,*
*In fire, see the dragon’s radiance.*
*The attuned gain nobility,*
*Those who hear of it find their Dao flourishing.*

The Patriarch once declared,
This is the sovereign of all joys.

Master Hai Chan says:
*Sea winds toss the golden boat on wave-crested terraces,*
*Only within it may one awaken to the Mystery.*
*Mother and child, upon meeting, are fit for tender devotion;*
*Monarch and minister, once united, rejoice in perfect reunion.*
*Eight directions encircle the dragon’s fiery course;*
*Four quarters push forth the tiger’s descent to the spring.*
*Let this be told to later Dao-seekers:*
*To refine the elixir, one must employ the lead of the watery realm.*

He also says:
*A patch of limpid clarity, a single blossom,*
*White hibiscus enfolding purple cinnabar.*
*Beyond the world’s bounds, none can rival it;*
*In heaven above or among men below, nothing compares.*
*The golden tiger descends, veiling its dark hue;*
*The fire dragon first subdues, then transforms into yellow sprout.*
*When spirit and clarity penetrate the scene of true return,*
*Without encountering an extraordinary person, one dare not boast.*

**The Well-Dredging Formula**
After dredging the well for elixir refinement, take care not to stir up filth. Wait until the water pulse settles, then draw and replace it to flush away stagnant spring water. Only then may it be left exposed to the open sky, where stars and moon may shine upon it. Once the water’s nature is settled and the black earth has been gathered, one may then draw the water to refine the elixir.
If the stone base appears bluish-white, this is the water of the yang pulse—most urgently suited for elixir circulation.
If one encounters black mud, yellow spring water, red veins, or iron-rust bitterness with an astringent taste, these signs indicate intermingled water pulses, yin-yang stagnation, and unsuitability for elixir refinement. One should select another site and construct anew.

**The Immortal’s Method for Dwelling in Mountains**
For those who would ascend mountains to cultivate perfection or reside securely in the world, one must examine the auspiciousness of the dwelling’s earth. On a *wu* or *ji* day, inscribe the Yellow Writ of the Nine Earths and Thirty-Six Sounds upon white paper, place it at the center of the dwelling, and cover it with a clean basin for three nights. Upon uncovering, observe:
- If the paper is moistened with green, a corpse lies buried beneath.
- If moistened with white, great misfortune.
- If red, there will be fright and terror.
- If black, treasure lies below.
- If yellow, great fortune.
- If purple, one will attain immortality.
If no change appears, the dwelling may be safe for three years; beyond that, harm will surely follow.

**The Furnace-Building Method**
During the *jiazi* decade, on a *wushen* day, gather earth from the southwest *shen* direction. First, pile the earth into an altar of three tiers. The furnace shall have eight faces and eight gates, with partitions above each gate. Place the cauldrons upon the partitions: the water cauldron above, the medicine cauldron below. The water cauldron’s mouth should remain open to receive water, then sealed with a lid.
The furnace body shall be two *chi* and one *cun* in length, one *chi* and six *cun* in width, with a central clear space of one *chi* and three *cun*, and a thickness of three *cun*. Open a fire gate at the front, five *cun* high and four *cun* wide. Leave an aperture at the rear to vent black fire, like a turtle’s chimney.

**The Fire-Timing Formula**
One month comprises six periods, each period lasting five days. The day-count method follows:
- **First period**: On the first day, one *liang* of the direct tally, two days and a half (thirty hours). Increase to two *liang*, sixty hours.
- **Second period**: Three *liang*, two days and a half (thirty hours). Increase to four *liang*, sixty hours.
- **Third period**: Five *liang*, two days and a half (thirty hours). Increase to six *liang*, sixty hours.
- **Fourth period**: Neither increase nor decrease; use only six *liang*, two days and a half (thirty hours). Then reduce to five *liang*, sixty hours.
- **Fifth period**: Four *liang*, two days and a half (thirty hours). Reduce to three *liang*, sixty hours.
- **Sixth period**: Two *liang*, two days and a half (thirty hours). Reduce to one *liang*, sixty hours.

The six-period direct tally’s waxing and waning over one month is arranged as follows, cycling without end. At the start of the second month, begin the fire anew, increasing to two *liang* over thirty hours, then to three *liang* over sixty hours. Each subsequent month, up to nine months, requires an additional *liang*, reaching nine *liang* by the ninth month—this is the fixed measure. Thus it is said: *Nine yang, nine yin; no further increase.* Even after three or nine years, no further addition is made; adhere strictly to this method.
Begin the fire on a *jiazi* day. The daily fire moves forward; the hourly fire moves backward. From midnight to noon, divide the black [yin] to the month’s end. Each month, increase the fire by one *liang*; each year, increase the fire by one *liang*. On days governed by the Water Star, increase the fire; on days governed by the Fire Star, reduce the water.

**The Formula for Discerning True Lead and Mercury**
For lead: take one *jin* of the first-refined silver from which lead has been removed, and employ it at the furnace.
For mercury: take half a *jin* of large cinnabar pieces the size of a hibiscus arrowhead, and employ it at the furnace.
Lead is called the White Tiger; mercury is called the Green Dragon. Such is the principle for discerning lead and mercury.

**The Hua Pond Pairing Formula**
The pairing of the Hua Pond unites the primordial One. When lead, mercury, and cinnabar encounter fire, they transform; when they meet wine, they congeal. The Perfected One’s method uses wine to bind them and fire to transform them. Thus, brew a thousand-day rice wine until it is limpid, then use it to boil and unite the lead, mercury, and cinnabar—the method is thus established.

**The Formula for Subduing Lead and Mercury**
Lead can subdue cinnabar, but without tin, it will not succeed. Cinnabar can subdue silver, but without silver, it will not transform. Mercury can alloy with lead, but without fire, they will not unite. Fire can transform things, but without wine, they will not congeal.

**The Furnace-Entry Formula**
Take lead as earth—earth must receive three.
Take mercury as marsh—one can encompass three.
Take cinnabar as seed—two seeds serve as the model.
Take wine as plowing—ten plowings are complete.
Take fire as reception—half is the essence.
Take the vessel as the granary—sealed and secured, it is complete.
When cinnabar forms a pact with lead, enter and merge with the cinnabar. Return to the origin, pouring mercury without cease. The method is natural—what need is there for defense or flourish? Within a hundred days, one attains the sentiment of immortals.

**The Formula for Drawing Mercury from Cinnabar**
Grind one *jin* of luminous cinnabar into powder. Take a bamboo tube with tightly spaced nodes, leaving three nodes intact.

**Method for Drawing Mercury from the Upper Node**
Open the upper node to the size of a pellet.
Open the middle node to the size of a malt-sugar lump—this is where the mercury will flow downward.
Above the opening of the middle node, first lay two layers of waxed paper. Place cinnabar powder on the waxed paper, then insert it into the upper end of the tube. Bind it tightly with hemp fiber. Steam the bamboo tube in rice for one day.
Next, coat it with Six-One Mud to a thickness of three *fen*. Bury it in the earth so the tube is level with the ground, packing the soil tightly around it to prevent any leakage of *qi*.
Then pile firewood and burn it over the tube’s opening for one full cycle. Let the fire’s power penetrate the upper node, causing the mercury to flow down into the lower node without the slightest loss.
If the fire is too weak and the mercury is not fully extracted—if the residue remains heavy and dark purple—burn it again as before until the mercury reaches its original weight. Once it reaches fourteen *liang*, stop.

For extracting mercury from Red Horse-Sprout Cinnabar, White Horse-Sprout Cinnabar, or Purple Spirit-Light Cinnabar, follow this same method; all others are incorrect.

**Method for Removing Fire-Toxin from the Elixir**
Place the elixir in a thin porcelain bottle, seal the mouth with yellow wax, then wrap it tightly in oil-dan silk. Secure it firmly and submerge it in a cold spring for fourteen days before removing.
Set the bottle in a double boiler and steam it for one day to dispel the cold *qi*. Then take it out, grind it to a fine powder, and mix it with paper-mulberry juice to form pills (jujube pulp may also be used). Make the pills the size of mung beans.
Take one pill with well-water at dawn. After half a month, increase to two pills; after thirty days, increase to three pills—no more.
First, offer seven pills to Heaven, seven to Earth, and seven to the stars. Then bathe, fast, and purify yourself, cutting off all desires before consuming the elixir.
Take it at dawn, facing east, either standing or sitting.

**Signs of Efficacy After Consuming the Golden Elixir**
At first, the elixir will make the limbs weak, the waist and knees heavy, and cause pain below the navel. The mouth will constantly taste foul and black, the teeth will loosen, and the breath will reek of blood. At night, there will be burning thirst, vomiting, or nausea, along with mild diarrhea. Food will lose its flavor, the body will gradually waste away, the eyes will strain, the spirit will wander, sores and swellings will appear, and the whole body will ache. The skin will feel as if insects are crawling over it, and mouth sores will develop—all these are signs of the elixir driving out diseases.
There may be throat soreness, chest tightness, and blackened congestion, with foul, dark watery stools resembling shrimp or spider skins, or like mallow or gromwell juice. The waist may feel blocked, or various worms may be expelled. The skin may swell, and the sinews may twitch or spasm, sometimes slack, sometimes tense. Within ten days, wind-toxins will gradually emerge. The abdomen may rumble, and clumps of flesh may pass—this is the elixir attacking long-standing illnesses. Wait until hunger returns, then eat one or two servings of bland gruel or take the *Yu Dan* powder to counteract the elixir’s toxicity.

**Prescription for Counteracting Elixir Toxicity**
*Ophiopogon* (with hearts removed) – 4 *liang*
*Asparagus* (with hearts removed) – 4 *liang*
*Rehmannia* (dried) – 5 *liang*
*Licorice* – 1 *liang*
*Ginseng* – 3 *liang*
*Poria* – 2 *liang*
*Aster* (with roots removed) – 2.5 *liang*
*Burnet* – 3.5 *liang*
*Hematite* – 1.5 *liang*
*Seaweed* – 1.5 *liang*
*Gardenia* – 4.5 *liang*
Grind the above ingredients into a powder. Take two *qian* per dose, mixed with rice water, after consuming the elixir.

**Signs of the Three Corpses’ Departure**
When the Three Corpses are about to leave, one will feel restless and on the verge of madness. The spirit will wander, and there may be fright, palpitations, or nightmares of being devoured by venomous snakes, tigers, or wolves, or of falling from cliffs, encountering enemies, or parting from loved ones—these are the omens.
When sensing these signs of the Three Corpses leaving, remain patient and at ease, control anger, and simply drink one or two bowls of thick licorice decoction. A slight sweat will dispel all disturbances.

**Signs of the Three Corpses Leaving the Body**
After the Three Corpses depart, one will feel lighter, free from thoughts and worries, desires will vanish, and the heart will rejoice—this is the sign of the elixir’s spirit taking effect and offering support.

**Signs of Bone and Skin Transformation**
After taking the elixir, old ailments will flare up, sores and swellings may appear, and there may be slight bleeding or clear scars—these are signs of long-accumulated toxins being expelled through the skin by the elixir’s influence.

**Signs of Rejuvenated Appearance and New Teeth**
After consuming the elixir for a thousand days, the complexion will gradually grow youthful. The teeth may loosen, and the jaw may feel tight—this is the replacement of old teeth with new, elixir-born teeth.
The head and face may itch deeply, even to the marrow, and hair may grow on the ears and brows—this is the effect of the elixir strengthening the hair roots.
After three years of taking the elixir, all chronic illnesses will vanish. The flesh will grow smooth, the beard and temples will turn black, the blood vessels will flow freely, the complexion will transform, lost teeth will regrow, hearing and vision will sharpen, and the sinews will strengthen.
After three full years, the bone marrow will fill with black blood, the face will become childlike, the name will be recorded in the Southern Palace and stricken from the Northern Dipper’s register. All spirits will revere you, dragons and tigers will submit, the intestines will turn to gold, the body will be like cold jade, and the form will become immortal material. You will commune with spirits, attain sagehood, and naturally ascend, untouched by cold or heat, your lifespan equaling Heaven and Earth.

**Another Method for Removing Fire-Toxin**
*Eleuthero* – 1 *jin*
*Burnet* – 1 *jin*
*Phyllanthus* – 1 *jin*
*Niter* – 4 *liang*
*Licorice* – 4 *liang*
Grind the above ingredients into a fine powder and mix with the elixir. Boil them together in water, adding more water as needed, for seven days and nights. Then place the mixture in a cold spring for one month.
Next, boil it in cow’s milk for one day, then transfer it to a bottle and steam it in a double boiler for seven days. Remove, dry, grind into an extremely fine powder, and form into pills with jujube pulp.

**Another Method**
Char licorice over fire, hold it in the mouth, and swallow the saliva to gradually resolve the toxin. Alternatively, decoct licorice in water, let it cool, and drink it to achieve the same effect.

**Another Method**
Before the beginning of spring, collect snow from the central beam of the roof in a porcelain vessel and boil it. Snow from the rooftop is unsuitable.

**Another Method**
Place the medicinal ingredients into a bamboo tube, first scraping away its green outer layer. Wrap the opening of the tube in multiple layers of raw silk cloth and set it in a pot filled with black soybeans, ensuring the soybeans do not submerge the tube’s mouth. Add water gradually and boil for the duration of the three *fu* periods. Meanwhile, dissolve honey in hot water and pour it into the tube, then steam in a double boiler, replenishing as it reduces to prevent the tube from tilting. Once the time is complete, remove the contents, refine with water, and form into pills the size of hemp seeds with jujube pulp. Take two pills on an empty stomach with saliva.
