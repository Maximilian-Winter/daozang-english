First, fast in the mountains and forests for forty days, abstaining from all external affairs. Then prepare the divine clay. After one hundred days, the clay for the crucible will be complete.

Obtain a fire-resistant earthen crucible with a capacity of three *dou*, its color—white or red—being of no consequence, provided it withstands heat without cracking.

**Method for Preparing Divine Clay:**
Six parts leftward-facing oyster shells from the Eastern Sea, three parts mole cricket soil, one part fine horse shed-hair, three parts talc, three parts red halloysite, two parts fine sheep wool, and half a part of *dagu* (a mineral salt). Combine these seven ingredients, pound them finely, and sift. Mix with *bairi jiang* (a fermented liquid aged one hundred days), then pound thirty thousand times. If the clay is too loose, add more red halloysite; if too stiff, add more *jiang*. Pound again until it becomes a smooth, refined paste. Shape and treat the clay with care, ensuring utmost precision.

Select only the white inner layer of the oyster shells, discarding the outer bone-like skin. Wash the horse and sheep wool thoroughly, and separately sift the mole cricket soil to remove coarse impurities. The proportions are not measured by weight but by the amount needed to coat two crucibles, with each ingredient added in equal measure.

Coat the inside and outside of the two crucibles with a layer of clay seven *fen* thick. Apply gradually: first a thin layer, let it dry in the shade, then add more clay until the thickness reaches seven *fen*.

Once the seven-*fen* coating is complete and dry, mix *jiang* with red lead and pound thirty thousand times until it forms a paste. Coat the inside of the two crucibles with this paste to a thickness of three *fen*. If cracks appear, add more clay and dry in the shade for ten days to prevent further cracking. Red lead is lead oxide; do not use this paste to coat the outside.

After placing the ingredients inside, seal tightly with refined clay, ensuring all seams are secure to prevent leaks. Then coat the outside—top, bottom, and sides—with a layer four *fen* thick. Let it dry in the shade for twenty-seven days. If fine cracks appear on the outside, use a brush made of sheep’s whiskers to apply more clay, then dry for another seven days. The outer layer should eventually reach a thickness of one *cun* and four or five *fen* for best results.

Thus, the preparation of the divine clay and the sealing of the crucible are complete. This method is simpler than that for the crucible of the ninefold-transmuted golden liquid, but the clay must be refined to the utmost precision, with careful attention to proportion and application—surpassing even the ninefold crucible in exactitude. Guard against leaks, for if the essence scatters, the elixir will fail, and the fasting and preparation will be in vain.

On a day aligned with the lunar cycle, fast again for one hundred days. Upon completion, offer three *hu* of clear wine to the east-flowing waters, reciting by the riverbank:
*"Great Mystery of the Azure Flow, Eight Seas and Nine Rivers,
Mountain spirits and earth deities, guard above the elixir’s essence.
Three *hu* of fine wine, reverently offered to the river’s numen."*
Then depart without looking back. On that same day, place the ingredients into the crucible.

The elixir should be compounded in the mountains by an east-flowing stream, in a place untouched by human footsteps, where the sounds of chickens and dogs cannot be heard. Take heed.

**Ingredients for the Lánggān Radiant Elixir:**
- *Jiangling cinnabar child*: ten *jin* (oral instruction: cinnabar).
- *Sun’s soul of Cinnabar Mountain*: five *jin* (oral instruction: realgar).
- *White silk flying dragon*: one *jin* (oral instruction: white quartz).
- *Green-waisted maiden*: five *liang* (oral instruction: malachite).
- *Purple mound literary lord*: five *liang* (oral instruction: purple quartz).
- *Flying blossoms of Jasper Wall*: five *liang* (oral instruction: graphite).
- *Mysterious Pearl of the Northern Emperor*: one *jin* (oral instruction: saltpeter).
- *Yellow lad of the Nine Numinous*: five *liang* (oral instruction: sulfur).
- *Five-essence golden sheep*: five *liang* (oral instruction: actinolite core).
- *Flying blossoms of rain’s splendor*: five *liang* (oral instruction: mica).
- *White tiger’s shed fangs*: five *liang* (oral instruction: gold-tooth stone).
- *Flowing cinnabar white paste*: one *jin* (oral instruction: lead white).
- *Reversed divine bone*: five *liang* (oral instruction: halite).
- *Moon’s radiance of the Mysterious Terrace*: five *jin* (oral instruction: orpiment).

In total, fourteen ingredients. Pound each separately, beginning with cinnabar, five thousand times per ingredient. The person pounding the ingredients must be temperate and discreet, avoiding idle chatter. They should fast for thirty days beforehand. When compounding the elixir, only three or four people may be present, for trustworthy assistants are rare; if even one lacks sincerity, the work will be ruined.

Once the Radiant Elixir is complete, one *liang* constitutes a single immortal’s dose. If one wishes to remain in the mortal world for a time, half a *liang* may be taken.

After pounding all ingredients separately, place them into the crucible in the following order:
First, halite, spread evenly on the bottom.
Then saltpeter, mica, actinolite, gold-tooth stone, lead white, malachite, sulfur, white quartz, graphite, purple quartz, orpiment, realgar, and finally cinnabar—cinnabar alone remains on top.

All fourteen ingredients should be layered in sequence, filling the crucible without compression. Finally, pour three *jin* of mercury over the ingredients to complete the process.

Then place the earthen crucible atop, sealing its rim with red lead paste, and coat its outer edges with oyster-shell mortar. Allow this to dry in the shade, then apply another layer of mortar to the entire exterior—top, bottom, and all four sides—until it reaches a thickness of four *fen*.

Construct the furnace chamber by first excavating the ground to a depth of three *chi*, removing all impure soil and replacing it with good earth, tamped firmly to fill the pit. Then, upon this level surface, raise the furnace base to a height of two *chi* and five *cun*. Do not build the furnace atop old graves, former dwellings, or ruined sites.

The furnace chamber should measure three *zhang* in length, one *zhang* and six *chi* in width, and one *zhang* and six *chi* in height. Keep it clean and well-maintained, covering its inner and outer walls with fine thatch and plastering them securely. Install two doors—one facing due east, the other due south—each four *chi* wide, and close them at dusk. The fire-tender and the master should remain within the chamber.

Place a trivet at the center of the chamber floor, with the furnace mouth oriented toward the east, constructed of fine bricks and stones. Mix vinegar and east-flowing water with finely sifted white clay and the fur of oxen, horses, river deer, and stags to form a mortar, then plaster the furnace. Inside the furnace, set an iron grate, and place the crucible upon it, ensuring the crucible sits at the center with a gap of three and a half *cun* between its sides and the furnace walls. The furnace should rise two *chi* above the crucible, while the crucible’s base should be one *chi* and eight *cun* above the ground.

Ignite a gentle fire of fine chaff beneath the crucible, keeping it approximately one *chi* away. Regulate the flame carefully to avoid violent heat. After twenty days, adjust the fire to maintain a distance of six *cun* from the crucible. After another twenty days, reduce the distance to four *cun*; after yet another twenty days, to one *cun*. Ten days later, bring the fire directly beneath the crucible; after another ten days, allow the flames to reach halfway up its sides. Finally, after twenty more days—completing a full hundred days—the elixir will be ready.

Cool it for three days before opening. The flying blossoms will lightly adhere to the upper crucible. Sweep them gently with the feather of a three-year-old rooster, and the blossoms will display thirty-seven hues, shimmering with radiant purples and dark brilliance. This is called the *Langgan Blossom Elixir*. On the first day of the eleventh, fourth, or eighth lunar month at dawn, face the sovereign, bow twice, and consume one *liang* with east-flowing water. Immediately, seven-colored *qi* will rise from your crown, your face will gleam with golden and jade-like radiance, and by holding your breath, you will summon the Eight Mystic Chariots. Spitting upon the ground will transform it into a flying dragon; a whistle to the left will summon immortals to court; a gesture to the right will unite the Three Pristine Ones with the wind. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders will carry you in flight to the Upper Clarity.

If the elixir blossoms have not fully risen, reseal the crucible’s seams with mortar as before, ensuring it is airtight, and resume firing the crucible’s belly for forty-nine days—failure will no longer be possible.

**Method for the Yellow Water Moon-Blossom Elixir**
After firing the crucible for a hundred days to produce the *Langgan Blossom Elixir*, do not open it. Instead, continue firing as before, following the same incremental adjustments to the flame’s distance. After another hundred days—totaling two hundred days—cool it for six nights, then open it. The myriad essences will have congealed upon the upper crucible, forming a canopy. Within this canopy will be yellow water, and upon the water, yellow blossoms resembling hibiscus. This is called the *Yellow Water Moon-Blossom*. The canopy will cling to the upper crucible like dark bile. Gather and consume the blossoms, drinking one *sheng* of the yellow water. Your form will divide into ten thousand transformations, your eyes will become luminous moons, and you will float through the Great Void, soaring into the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace.

**Method for the Reciprocating Water Jade Essence Elixir**
After firing the crucible for two hundred days to produce the *Yellow Water Moon-Blossom*, do not open it. Instead, resume firing as before for another hundred days—totaling three hundred days. Cool it for nine nights, then open it. The myriad essences will have formed a bud, adhering to the upper crucible. Within the bud will be white water, resembling jade paste, swirling and flowing ceaselessly in a leftward motion. In the white water will float three luminous pearls, each the size of a chicken’s egg, called the *Reciprocating Water Jade Essence*. Their taste is a hundredfold sweetness, their fragrance soft as malt sugar. Consuming one pearl will instantly unite you with Heaven, your body generating water and fire, your spittle transforming into jade, your form becoming the sun. The Heavenly Emperor will descend to welcome you, and you will ascend to the Upper Clarity upon a radiant chariot.

Dig a pit seven *chi* deep and wide, retrieve the *Langgan Blossom Elixir*, and mix it with a portion of the *Reciprocating Water* the size of a chicken’s egg. Plant this in the pit, cover it with soil, and tamp it firmly. After three years, a tree will grow, its bark red as dates, standing three to four *chi* tall. Its fruit will resemble bracelets, called the *Ring-Stalwart Tree*. Consuming its fruit will unite you with Heaven, allowing you to ascend to the Great Ultimate and transform your form into clouds. It is also called the *Great Ultimate Hidden Mushroom*.

Dig a pit six *chi* deep and wide, plant one of the bracelet-like fruits, and water it with five *ge* of yellow water. Cover it with soil and tamp it firmly. After three years, a gourd-like herb will grow, its seeds resembling peaches in five colors, called the *Phoenix-Brain Mushroom*. Consuming its fruit will allow you to ascend to the Great Ultimate; spitting upon the ground will transform it into a phoenix, and you may ride it in flight. It is also called the *Great Ultimate Hidden Mushroom*.

Dig a pit one *zhang* deep and wide, take four *ge* of yellow water and one *Phoenix-Brain* fruit, and plant them together, watering the fruit with the yellow water. Cover it with soil and tamp it firmly. After three years, a red tree resembling a pine will grow, five to six *chi* tall. Its fruit will resemble pears, its seeds pure white as jade. Consuming its fruit will allow you to ascend to the Grand Tenuity; spitting upon the ground will transform it into green jade.

Dig a pit eight *chi* deep and wide, plant the red tree’s seeds, and water them with five *ge* of *Reciprocating Water*. Cover it with soil and tamp it firmly. After three years, a crimson tree resembling a plum will grow, six to seven *chi* tall, bearing green fruit like dates, their color a vivid emerald. Consuming its fruit will allow you to ascend to the Purple Tenuity; spitting upon the ground will transform it into gold, and you will ride upon dark clouds in flight.

The *Water-Yang Azure Reflection Elixir Method*:
Take one *sheng* and five *ge* each of yellow water and *Reciprocating Water*—three *sheng* in total—and separately heat them in a small iron vessel until they boil seven times, whereupon they will merge and transform into azure water, called *Water-Yang Azure Reflection*. Drink it at dawn in one draught, and your body will radiate the luster of green jade; your breath will exhale purple mist, and you will ascend to the *Upper Clarity*. Spitting upon the ground will produce cinnabar of eight *shi*.

In an iron vessel, heat one *jin* of lead and two *liang* of mercury until they reach a rolling boil, then add one *zhū* of *Langgan Flower Elixir*—within the time it takes to eat a meal, true silver will form. In an iron vessel, heat one *jin* of lead and five *liang* of mercury until they reach a rolling boil, then add three *zhū* of *Langgan Flower Elixir*—within the time it takes to eat a meal, purple gold will form.

Once the gold and silver are refined, cast each into a cake weighing fifty *jin* and cast them into an eastward-flowing river. As you stand by the water, recite the incantation:
*"Heavenly River Weaving Maiden, Earthly River Water Lord, the Great Elixir achieves its bloom, the immortal soul refines the spirit. Forever depart the earthly realm, ascend as an imperial guest. Offer these paired treasures to guard the source and nourish the marsh."*

After the incantation, depart immediately without looking back.

To cultivate the divine trees, dig a pit on the shady side of a renowned mountain, keeping it isolated on all sides so that neither human nor beast treads upon it.

The *Celestial Sovereign of the Upper Clarity and Later Sage*, from youth devoted to the Dao, received and practiced these secret essentials, thereby attaining the rank of Emperor of the Golden Tower.

The *Five Elders of the Upper Realms* and *Lord Zuojuan of the Great Ultimate* compiled and presented this as the *Numinous Writ of the Purple Text*, entrusting it to the *Great Lord of the Eastern Palace, Azure Lad*, to disseminate below, inscribe the mysterious names, and bestow upon those destined to become Perfected.

These are the secret words of the *Supreme*, the purple texts of the *Later Sage*. The methods of the *Enlightened Sovereign of the Four Poles* permit transmission only thrice within seven hundred years. If two suitable recipients appear within a century, they may be taught, but the oath must remain: no more than three transmissions in seven hundred years. Once the allotted time expires, no further dissemination is permitted.

At the time of transmission, observe a seven-day fast, then bestow the text with reverence. Ten *Divine Officials of the Upper Realms*, ten *Jade Maidens*, and ten *Jade Lads* shall attend, recording the text and overseeing its conveyance, scrutinizing merits and faults, and impeaching errors.

Those who study immortality must be clear and cautious from the outset. The method requires establishing a covenant and pledging sincerity to ensure secrecy. When transmitting the *Records of the Perfected Sovereign*, the disciple must practice refined absorption of mist, receive the *Yin-Life of Illuminating Openness* and the *Celestial August Symbol Talismans*, as well as the *Upper Scripture of Seizing the Soul and Restraining the Spirit*. The master shall receive forty *chi* of white silk, two pairs of silver rings, and four *liang* of undyed silk as substitutes for the blood-oath of the field, sealing the vow of secrecy.

When receiving the *Upper Scripture of the Divine and True Langgan Flower Elixir*, the master shall be presented with a *Golden Dragon* and a *Jade Fish* as substitutes for the carved-oath of the body, ensuring the pact of inviolable secrecy.

The *Supreme Sovereigns of Antiquity* all safeguarded divine texts, preventing their careless disclosure. Thus, they emphasized solemn oaths to prevent leaks, demonstrating earnest devotion and clarifying the foundation of their practice. Those who violate the precepts and disclose the secret *Purple Texts and Records of the Later Sage* shall bring calamity upon their three generations of ancestors and parents: in life, they will suffer the punishments of water and fire; in death, they will endure interrogation by the *Three Officials*. Their bodies will perish and become lowly ghosts, their names erased from the immortal registers, their souls bound to the stones of *Northern Qi*, their records consigned to *Mount Tai*, their essences drawn from the waters of *Western Ford* and cast into the *Eastern Sea*. Beware, be vigilant!

All medicinal ingredients are measured by the ancient standards, ensuring the utmost purity.

The *Azure Lad*, whose tabooed name is *Fanmei*, is to be visualized on each of the eight solar terms.

*Lord Wang* said: The oath of the *Golden Dragon* and *Jade Fish* is rare in the world, and one must not fail to transmit it before the allotted time expires. The above instructions may be substituted with thirty *chi* of blue cloth for the covenant. Blue represents the purity of the heart; cloth represents the manifestation of sincerity.
