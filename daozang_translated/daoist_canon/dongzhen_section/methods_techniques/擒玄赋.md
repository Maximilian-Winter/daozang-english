### **The Rhapsody on Capturing the Mysterious: Returning Elixir**

The Five Phases revolve in cycle—thus is the wondrous elixir perfected!
The *elixir* is firm, casting off softness;
The *return* is the end that reverts to the beginning.
It steers yin and yang to restrain one another,
borrows hun and po to seek each other.
Essence refines and bestows life,
piercing the Three Clarities through the Qian Horse;
Luminous tallying with creation,
circulating the One Qi through the Kun Ox.

Now, the origin of the Golden Elixir,
the master of spirit and qi,
holds the Dragon and Tiger within Zhen and Dui,
pairs Water and Fire at Zi and Wu.
One male, one female,
harmonizing in three thousand cycles of reproach;
One sovereign, one minister,
dispensing generation and completion through the Nine Fives.
The petty recites: Mao and You as guards,
Li and Kan as glory.
It grinds ascent and descent within the Eight Trigrams,
investigates compliance and conquest among the Five Phases.
Within the dark ford,
it observes non-being become being;
Within the void and nothingness,
it attains heaviness to become light.
One serves as root and origin,
another as attendant and follower.
Relying on the Yellow Sovereign for union,
depending on gold and silver for efficacy.

The depths of the divine chamber,
four seasons’ labor ripens in autumn;
The outer and inner of the embryo,
eight months’ refinement sows in winter.
How could this not be the passion of Heaven and Earth’s intercourse,
the union of Sun and Moon to achieve fruition?
Water must congeal for lead to coalesce,
mercury must dry for gold to merge.
Crow and Hare enter the furnace,
blending into the shell of the parrot’s child;
Wind and cloud enter the tripod,
echoing the cry of the returned infant.

How splendid!
Transforming mortality into immortality,
reversing age to regain youth.
Years pass yet remain,
hills and valleys shift yet grow wondrous.
The Three Sovereigns refined their merit to ascend in broad daylight,
the assembled sages perfected their practice to receive the purple phoenix’s summons.
Thus, to prolong distant life,
one must rely on the numinous elixir:
exchange mortal bones for purity,
forge immortal bones to withstand cold.
When the Purple Mansion and Turtle Palace beckon,
cranes dance within the tripod;
When the Cinnabar Terrace and Jade Gardens call,
clouds arise beneath the feet.

Therefore, those who encounter the true wind in past lives,
who are born under the mysterious decree,
live as long as the Two Rites,
equal the Three Luminaries in completion.
Guard the Middle Origin to perfect the Nine Revolutions,
embrace the One Qi to fulfill the myriad things.

### **Dao Gives Birth**

Heaven and Earth embrace transformation—this is their mother!
Vast and boundless,
profound and measureless,
born from the nameless beginning,
emerging before the Great Unity.
Interweaving actions,
it becomes the mysterious mother of transforming things;
Misty and pregnant,
it shapes images before Heaven.
Water contains its One,
Fire engenders its Two.
The movement of the moth’s key births wind,
yin and yang unite to congeal Earth.
At the first division of *tun* and *meng*,
it spreads the Two Luminaries to create form;
Once day and night separate,
it embodies the Three Powers to establish positions.
Truly, the Dragon moves through the Nine Fives,
circulating in response to the Three Fields.
The Eight Trigrams arise from Kun Fire,
the Five Phases emerge from Kan’s male.
When the count reaches Lesser Yang,
it receives Kun and Gen to challenge foes;
When Jia and Yi are fulfilled,
it encompasses Metal and Wood.
Thus, it emerges and withdraws from the divine furnace,
revolves and returns to its dwelling.
The Nine Lands dissolve to give life,
the Four Seasons alternate to nurture transformation.
Adapting to seasons and nodes,
water and wind follow rain through the Three Fields;
Universally moving all beings,
the Fire Dragon traverses half the night.

How could this not be the One Qi’s opening of creation,
the Great Yang’s branching?
The Sun’s radiance courses beneath the sea,
the Moon’s brilliance shines at heaven’s edge.
Water meets Fire and surges in waves—
clear and turbid divide;
Metal attains Wood and becomes Earth—
red and white reside here.
Reverent indeed!
Endowed with nature and form,
appearing through the mechanism of change.
At the waxing and waning of the Nine Fives,
it transforms through the Three Ones.
Scattered as the Seven Treasures,
it becomes the rare marvel of a prosperous nation;
Congealed as the Three Flowers,
it serves as the auspicious omen for saving the body.

Thus, when yang reaches its peak, it fills;
when metal flourishes, it wanes.
Things light and clear then ripen,
the elixir dissolves and ceases.
Lead belongs to yang essence,
returning to the origin while mercury discards life and death.
Refining away yin dregs,
their union knows no flourishing or decline.
Therefore, guard the spirit firmly,
hold fast to mother and child.
Three are the elixir’s uses,
One is the Dao’s head.
Each returns to its original birth,
Heaven and Earth achieve the longevity of the ancients.

### **The Source of Dao**

Illuminating the root and sprout,
refining to perfect the medicine.
The *Source* is the mother of the myriad things,
the *Dao* is the name of the image and form.
Dao is conceived through the Source,
the Source flourishes through Dao.
Unheard by human ears,
it manifests in bestowing life;
Unseen in daily use,
it becomes clear through abiding breath.

Now, the origin of Heaven and Earth,
the root of father and mother—
sometimes it responds to the elixir chamber to settle,
sometimes it points to the Mud Pill to hasten.
Chaos divides form between south and north,
the child gestates in the mother’s womb;
Hazy and indistinct, it stirs between floating and sinking,
yin resides while yang unfolds.
Truly, cinnabar contains Earth’s po,
silver embraces Heaven’s hun.
Water is the ancestor of the Three Powers,
essence is the root of primordial qi.
The Two Sceneries communicate,
forming the vessel of the tripod and furnace;
The Four Qi surge and contend,
entering and exiting the Gate of the Mysterious Female.

Thus, the Black Tiger and Red Dragon,
the blue root and white stem.
Li and Kan are the ancestral home of Earth,
Earth and Water are the husband of Metal’s village.
Snow forms only through water,
blood arises from metal’s coagulation.
Mercury dries only when meeting lead,
water is controlled only by relying on Earth.

How could this not be the union of yin and yang’s tally,
the shared cultivation of creation?
Cranes pursue phoenixes in flight,
diligently casting into the nine tripods day by day;
Clouds bestow, rain rushes,
breath by breath descending the layered towers.

Thus, the Dragon presides over concealment,
cultivating at the Zi hour.
The Four Images congeal into elixir substance,
the Three Mercuries merge into lightning’s radiance.
First departing the southern land,
it forms autumn stone within the furnace;
Finally returning to the Nine Heavens,
it crystallizes golden sand upon the sea’s surface.
One sees only the dregs of yin washed away,
the forging of yang essence.
The Nine Revolutions transform and the elixir is complete,
the Four Seasons’ work and the Dao is achieved.

Having nurtured the yellow sprout, it can transmute tile into jade;
Having refined the white snow, it reverses age to return to infancy.

Thus, the aged endure through heaven and earth,
their bodies fortified by the elixir.
Ascending clouds in a chariot drawn by six dragons,
they arrive at will at the vermilion towers of the spirit realm;
Soaring, they conceal themselves within the celestial gourd,
wandering freely, their path leads to the azure vastness.

**Dragon and Tiger**
Dragon and Tiger pair in union,
cast into the golden crucible.
The Fire Male aligns with the East,
the Earth Female serves as their origin,
giving birth in the realm of emptiness,
dwelling upon the peak of Zhu Rong.
Generated in the number three,
they form *Li* and thus bear the name *Jia Tiger*;
Virtue attains the number four,
transforming *Yin* and thus called *Geng Dragon*.
Originally crowned by the wind of benevolence,
life begins with the birth of the Tiger.
Essence, meeting water, becomes mercury;
blood, encountering metal, turns to milk.
First named the Sacred Stone,
scattering like mist into clouds and rosy dawn;
*Kan* enters Kunlun,
trickling like rain into wind and storm.
Indeed, East and West subdue one another,
above and below contend,
the two eights brighten to perfection,
the Four Images merge at the center.
Named after Liu An,
who discoursed on autumn stone’s purity;
Titled for Hua Zi,
embodying the great roc’s flight.
Thus, form and shadow follow,
soul and spirit unite,
the crow hides upon Mount Tai,
the hare emerges from the Flowery Pond.
One is martial,
aiding the pivot of the fire gate;
One is civil,
serving the enlightened sovereign’s cauldron.
Is this not sinew and bone as vanguard,
flesh and blood in union?
Receiving watery lead in the golden crucible,
directing solar essence through the iron ox,
passing through fire, it takes flight,
its traces eluding even spirits and gods;
Encountering the tiger, it congeals,
its transformations defying heaven and earth.
Thus it flows yet forgets warmth,
glows yet retains substance,
follows the yellow light in transformation,
pursues the spirit turtle in ebb and flow.
Within the Three Sovereigns’ palace,
crimson snow drifts lightly;
Before the Five Emperors’ altar,
yellow clouds rise in streams.

**Autumn Stone**
The solar metal’s body is metaphorically called autumn stone.
"Autumn" derives from its whiteness,
"stone" from its hardness.
Roaming the principle of ninety thousand,
born with the weight of one *jin*.
Once metal and water part,
lead and silver manifest in form;
Mother and child briefly appear,
black and white merge in undifferentiated harmony.
Tracing its nature,
it transforms essence into spirit,
meeting yin fire, it first takes flight,
arriving in the metal’s homeland, it turns white.
First departing silver ore,
it follows the yellow sparrow into the Milky Way;
Scarcely returning to the toad’s palace,
it drifts with the pure wind along earth’s veins.
Indeed, to dry the clear mercury,
metal relies on white gold.
The child yearns for and clings to the mother,
yang seeks purity by shedding yin,
wealth fills and treasures overflow—
the immortal’s method of restraint and mastery.
When essence reaches completion, who worries of loss or gain?

Wondrous!
At midnight’s center, the first yang stirs,
red and white reflect one another,
true water circulates, purifying the depths.
Returning through the tail’s cavern,
as if brewing lead’s flowing form,
by the center, it has become the purple gold’s body.
Is this not the mother of primordial qi,
the essence of the five flavors?
Taking the treasure of horse’s teeth,
it establishes the name *knife-point*.
To wed the Alchemist Lord,
one must seek harmony with descendants;
To marry the Willow Maiden,
one must rely on the matchmaker’s art.
Thus, to preserve metal’s birth,
first refine the plain and pure.
Mercury, meeting lead, does not rise;
earth, receiving water, surrenders.
Its color gleams like jade,
self-named by King Huai;
Its nature is swift as a dragon,
metaphorically borrowed from Shen Nong.
Beautiful!
Utterly pure, utterly refined,
both firm and yielding,
Dragon and Tiger balance at *Mao* and *You*,
yin and yang flourish at mid-autumn.
Light and clear, it ascends to the muddy pellet,
its form like a vermilion phoenix;
Heavy and turbid, it descends from the floral canopy,
its body like a silvery stream.
Thus, in cultivating the returning elixir,
value arises from metal and stone.
Why discard the inner treasure,
only to cherish external jewels?
Pity the body’s wholeness between heaven and earth,
reverted to a dwelling for the Three Corpses.

**River Chariot**
The northern primordial qi is named the River Chariot.
"River" borrows the image of the celestial ford,
"chariot" is named for the earth’s axle.
Water moves only when the wheel turns,
qi flows only when the chariot advances.
Upholding rectitude at the center,
dwelling in earth, it engenders the ten thousand things;
Arriving at the northern position,
it harmonizes and refines the Three Clarities.
Originally, earth lodges in *Li*,
metal resides in the North.
In elixir-making, it serves for restraint and mastery,
in things, it holds the virtue of beginning and end.
Without fixed position, it congeals as the pivot of transformation;
With flowing form, it blends black and white.
One source flows into the Three Honored Ones as ancestors,
the Four Seas as home,
dwelling in the abode of the Primordial Rain Lord,
traveling in the chariot of the Celestial Matriarch.
In cultivating the golden elixir,
without comparison, how to proceed?
Arranging the spirit chamber,
only then does the sprout begin to grow.
Thus, it emerges as lead’s form,
enters as metal’s essence,
subduing ghosts below with its softness and moisture,
relying on the good matchmaker for union.
At times, it removes the old and turbid,
faintly dispersing from the layered towers;
At times, it circulates the new and clear,
breath by breath returning to the central upright.
Is this not because the turning relies on the pivot,
submission begins at the Milky Way?
Descending mercury fire into the golden crucible,
condensing mist upon the azure waves,
light and clear, it scatters as wind and cloud,
born within the sea;
Heavy and turbid, it transforms into flesh and blood,
descending from the mountain slopes.
Though spread across the four directions,
all return to one flavor.
Tracing the two paths, they converge in the furnace and crucible;
Taking the three passes, they enter the spleen and stomach.

The Earth Sovereign follows the axle at *mao* and *you*, thus circulating the flowing pearl;
The Flame Emperor pushes the chariot at *zi* and *wu*, receiving the conveyance of harmonious *qi*.
How wondrous!
Bestowing life upon the myriad things, nurturing the Five Constants,
it models itself upon Qian and Kun to establish its principles,
and accords with the elixir of cinnabar to prescribe its method.
When the twin descents cloud and ascend, I then bear them back to the source sea;
As the moon shifts and stars revolve, I then convey them into the cavern chamber.
Thus the dust-laden body is exchanged, the golden bones are readily formed.
The Great Dao completes its cycle through the four seasons,
the numinous elixir fulfills its work in ten months—
one then knows that the foolish, benighted in their cultivation, advance blindly,
while the worthy, their virtue manifest, attain it as if by pointing to the sun.

The Five Phases and *yin-yang* essence-*qi* array themselves across the five directions.
Transforming and nurturing the Five Phases, the utmost essence of *yin-yang*:
residing in Heaven, it governs the divisions of the stars;
anchoring Earth, it earns the names of the sacred peaks.
Their prosperity and decline occur in due time,
the primordial containing the mother of life and death;
The pivot lies in the essential,
their flourishing akin to the workings of creation.
Though they derive from the Two Modes, all return to one flavor:
the Azure embraces the essence of Qian’s yang,
while drawing upon Kun’s *yin* *qi*.
Fire is born in the North, rising to nurture the Three Powers;
Water grows in the South, descending to arrange the Five Wefts.
At a single recitation, it departs from its proper position,
flowing and infusing the four directions.
Mercury pairs with metal yet does not stir,
lead, meeting fire, begins to soar.
A single steed roams in circuit,
all duly bearing the mandate of the Supreme Emperor;
The four substances revolve and intermingle,
from here emerging and vanishing at the center.
Thus the dragon soars in the nine heavens,
the phoenix nests in the cinnabar cave.
The Kunlun Mountains rise in mist,
endowed with yang and resembling red lead;
The earthly gate births clouds,
by autumn assuming the form of white snow.
Is this not because the sun’s course follows order,
the Dao proceeds in accord with constancy?
Illuminating one direction brings clarity without distance,
perceiving the Five Thieves brings flourishing of itself.
When spirit and *qi* are complete,
ascension occurs here;
When crucible and furnace are prepared,
union proceeds thus.

Beginning from the central harmony,
its position divided into three and five.
The four *ming* serve as the realm of nurturance,
the five aggregates as the gate of ingress and egress.
Circling through creation,
relying on the mind-steed as matchmaker,
step by step forming its shape,
borrowing watery lead as its master.
In the South it pertains to fire,
in the North to *yin*;
Establishing images to distinguish branches and stems,
defining its body—who can discern its floating and sinking?
The sun restrains the female crow,
for in *geng* it sings of *jia* within;
The moon harbors the male parrot,
for in *mu* it chants of metal concealed within wood.
Thus the configuration coalesces naturally,
its method flowing and spreading in all directions.
Taking this as the origin of outer and inner,
employing it to harmonize the measures of Heaven and Earth—
not yet departed, it still belongs to the gate of life and death;
awakened and liberated, it surely transcends the path of divine immortality.

**Embryonic Breathing and Qi Absorption** are distinct, yet the inner elixir is thereby perfected.
The embryo congeals to form substance,
breath gathers to form the elixir.
The Five Sprouts complete and gaze longingly,
the two *qi* suffice for lingering.
Circulating through the four limbs,
they anchor radiance and bestow luster;
Swallowed and returned to the six palaces,
they support the exterior and interior to bring clarity and peace.
Originating from the serene harmony of the primordial,
floatingly entering the root of all things—
one may thereby preserve the source of the Dao and begin to esteem it.
Flaming across the four seas,
it receives the parents’ primordial essence;
Vast within the three palaces,
it takes in the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth.
Truly, spirit governs *qi*,
*qi* is endowed and completed by essence.
The Mysterious Female is the gate of ingress and egress,
the body the city that receives and contains.
Gradually stilling the toil of the dust,
valuing the heart-spirit without disorder;
Next regulating the joints,
causing blood and vessels to flow easily.
Thus, seated upright on the bed,
the spirit-light gazes inward,
taking in the new and clear to make it lustrous,
expelling the old and turbid to nourish flourishing.
First departing the earthly gate,
breath by breath passing through the layered towers;
Just entering the heavenly gate,
continuously traversing the three samādhis.
Is this not because spirit and *qi* harmonize,
the human Dao becomes manifest?
Abundant *qi* follows the transformation of spirit,
subtle rain follows the arising of wind.
Storing below in the Flowery Pond,
it flows in a fine, misty state;
Closing and returning to the primordial sea,
it is swallowed with a gurgling sound.
How splendid!
When roots flourish, leaves thrive;
when essence withers, people die.
Stirring the fluids to receive emptily,
returning to the original source to attain fullness.
Congealing within the golden crucible,
gently forming the shape of a pellet;
Coalescing toward the barren field,
turbidly resembling a hen’s egg.
Moreover, the *yin-yang* crucibles differ,
male and female natures are distinct.
Continuously, *qi* connects the viscera,
over time, the body becomes like wind and cloud.
Abiding in the world for long years,
preserving the rosy complexion with joy;
Reversing old age to regain youth,
filling the crimson body with misty radiance.
Thus, to seek the work of transcending the world,
one ingests in accord with the four seasons,
following inclination as the simurgh chariot leads ahead,
ascending the clouds as the dragon carriage floats to welcome.
The body transforms, becoming robust as feathers and wings grow,
*qi* endures, and celestial fragrance suffuses.

**The Stealing Mechanism**
Where there is movement and stillness, the mechanism responds of itself.
The thief observes *yin-yang* and may thereby fathom it;
the mechanism masters adaptability and reaches all things.
Whether the handle is large or small, its use is the same;
whether the power is dynamic or static, it is likewise so.
The worthy perceive it and blessings arrive;
the foolish slight it and calamity remains.
Its method originates from emptiness and nonbeing,
arising from wondrous existence.
Before, it is the mechanism that engages things;
the heart perceives the thief and extends life.
By the decree of King Huai of Chu,
the Three Thieves move and the elixir is formed;
By the insight of the Yellow Emperor,
the myriad things thereby rest in his hands.
At a single recitation, it is likened to the primordial image,
arising from a forced name.
Observing the movements of the spirit-bird,
embodying the workings of Heaven and Earth,
anticipating depth and shallowness—
what can be modeled is modeled,
what can be measured in gain and loss is measured.
Thus, the model is manifest in what can be practiced!
Only with profound resolve and intent,
nature and emotions aspiring upward—
Heaven, when aroused, contains transformation;
humans, when aroused, achieve beauty.
Yang ascends, *yin* descends,
the workings of spirit emerge with artistry!
The hare runs, the crow flies—
in the heart’s discernment, it is seen!
Is this not because the mysterious and the yellow are equally attained,
creation accords with the mechanism?
Without the mechanism, how could one obtain it?
Without virtue, the Dao would not be followed.
At the gate of Kan’s furnace,
I peer through the door and enter;
At the celestial street and tail cavern,
I steal the path and return.

How sublime!

To steal the "having" and steal the "non-having,"
to plunder Heaven and plunder Earth—
in the Dao, the empty resonance gives rise to the ten thousand things;
through me, its application achieves great beauty.

The Metal Dragon and Wood Tiger,
contracting Heaven and human in subtle completion;
The Fire Maiden and Water Man,
threading the returning elixir to its origin.

Thus, my virtue knows no rest,
advancing without retreat—
the model of the Three Heroes is not mere wisdom;
the worth of the Ten Sages is not mere talent.

Those who grasp the Dao
move in harmony with Heaven’s course and equal its function;
those who cultivate the body
arrive at divine aid and thus attain it.

Hence, good and evil branch into full distinction,
fortune and misfortune respond accordingly—
yearning for the blessings of prolonged vision,
delving into the fruition of long life.

Nine years bearing the exploration of Heaven’s cover and Earth’s support,
the merit flutters like simurgh plumes as immortal locks come to greet;
years piled upon years bearing the creation of yin and yang,
riding the crane as jade lads all arrive!

The *Ode on Capturing the Mysterious* is complete.
