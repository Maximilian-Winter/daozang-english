All who possess karmic destiny and are destined to receive this scripture must first swear an oath, cutting their flesh to seal the covenant, pledging faith before the Nine Heavens, and only then may it be transmitted. According to the statutes of the Supreme Lord of the Western Numinous, within two thousand two hundred years, it may be passed to only three persons.

The *Jade Radiance Upper Primordial Great Tiger Talisman* is the inner numen of the Nine Heavens Golden Dawn Majestic Spirit King, a sacred text harmonizing the dual radiance of the Two Luminaries. Its Dao is wondrous and perfectly true; its qi intermingles with the Upper Primordial. It is treasured by the Jade Emperor and revered by all the Celestial Sovereigns. Those who wear it command the essence of radiance, ascend the Nine Mornings, annihilate demonic spirits, and subdue the myriad gods. All who behold its text possess the innate endowment of true immortals and extend seven generations of blessed fortune.

Only after encountering a master who imparts its transmission, observing summer retreats in austere solitude, and severing ties with the mundane world may one don the *Halo of Majestic Spirit Talisman*, invoke the inner numen, and cause its luminous effulgence to suffuse the Great Void, thereby moving the Three Clarities to respond. Thus, divine immortals bow in submission, malevolent trials vanish without trace, and the adept’s destiny is prolonged through vigilant secrecy. Overseers observe and record their deeds and transgressions.

The Supreme Lord perpetually dispatches seventy million *Western Numinous Great Armor* spirits and seven thousand *Divine Tigers* to escort the *Radiant Essence Central King*, attending the scripture at the *Western Jasper Terrace of the Supreme Primordial*. The *Radiant Essence Central King* is the inner name of the *Supreme Golden Dawn Majestic Spirit King*. Those who know the name of the *Majestic Spirit King* command all lesser spirits and gods, who submit without exception to the adept.

This *Spirit King* is the supreme numen of the *Jade Essence Heavenly Primordial*, the majestic truth of the *Divine Tiger Golden Dawn*. Thus, wearing its text invokes the awe of the Six Heavens; grasping its talisman summons the Three Officials as vassals; venerating its chamber hastens the arrival of *Jade Splendor*; reciting its invocation opens the ford of the *Divine Tigers*. Its majesty pervades the Eight Voids; its numinosity penetrates the Nine Mornings. It beheads hordes of demons, strikes down great villains, compels mountains and peaks to bow in reverence, and subdues the sources of rivers and seas. With a roar, it commands the ten directions, enslaves divine immortals, bestows a lifespan equal to the Three Luminaries, and radiates majesty across the *Supreme Primordial*. Truly, this is a marvelous text of the *Upper Clarity*, a majestic chapter of the *Radiant Essence*.

When transmitting this divine text, one must carefully select the recipient. Only those whose karmic affinity aligns with destiny and whose innate endowment befits immortality may then seek the oral command of the *Grand Master*, the endorsement of the *Dharma Master*, and the covenant of the *Scripture Master*. They must invoke the talismanic response of the spirits, summon the wondrous awakening of qi, scrutinize subtle omens to determine alignment, and act upon the pivotal moment. If one transmits it recklessly without the mandate of the *Grand Master* or the endorsement of the *Dharma Master*, even if the recipient possesses the innate endowment of an immortal, the *Jade Name Youth*, or the seven generations of the adept’s ancestors, they will still face judgment in the netherworld’s statutes.

Thus, those who transmit without an oath cause the *Scripture Master* to die, their soul enslaved to the *Water Official*, while the disciple incurs the trial of *Heavenly Fire*. Those who swear an oath but fail to uphold it condemn the *Scripture Master* to perish in the *Path of Suffering*, while the disciple falls prey to demonic transformation. Therefore, the covenant is revered, and the oath must never be lightly broken. For this reason, *Water and Fire* serve as punishments from the *Divergent Heavens*, and the *Nine Demons* become the *Beams of Agony*. The soul suffers the *Punishment of the Womb*, enduring eternal torment in the *Great Darkness*. Though one may wander the grottoes and dwellings, beseeching the numen of the Celestial Sovereigns, even ten thousand repetitions will not absolve their sin, nor will their vows be heard. The *Seven Mysteries* endure eternal torment in hell.

The attainment of immortality is contingent upon celestial statutes and divine validation—let the adept be vigilant! If one wishes to expel the demonic spirits of the Six Heavens, capture and vanquish the poisonous qi of malevolent forces, or destroy and execute talismanic shrines, the adept must secretly practice the great invocatory method of the *Majestic Spirit King*.

First, knock the teeth thirty-six times, then visualize the *Radiant Essence Central King* emerging from the *Palace of the Six Harmonies’ Grotto Chamber* within oneself, appearing before the adept’s face, one inch from the nose. The *Radiant Essence Central King* is seven inches tall, wearing a *Luminous Dawn Crown* of plain splendor, clad entirely in white brocade robes. From its mouth issues the qi of *Golden Perfection*, billowing like white clouds. Command this cloudy qi to flow and envelop the four directions, encircling the adept’s body and proceeding forward.

Next, visualize within the white mist a sudden burst of *Vermilion Essence*, resplendent and flying with radiant light, flashing like a shooting star. In an instant, it transforms into hundreds of *Divine Tigers*, leaping forward to tear apart the targeted demonic thieves. Once complete, recite the invocation:

*"Supreme Illustrious Majesty, Inner Perfected of the Golden Dawn,
The Radiant Essence Central King releases qi to capture spirits,
Preparing the abode of the Profound Void.
The Celestial Sovereign commands his vassals;
Radiant mist flows with luminous brilliance,
Harmonizing with the Nine Heavens.
The majestic text shines forth;
Divine Tigers open the ford.
Numinous clouds billow;
Vermilion Essence fans the void.
Seven transformations of the Textual Adept,
Nine Heavens wield the Perfected.
Who dares oppose me?
Beheaded and torn asunder, the evil ones!
Malevolent trials and demonic villains crushed to dust,
Ten thousand demons annihilated in an instant.
Dual Radiance unites to guard the Majestic King,
Ascending to the Celestial Mornings.
Supreme Primordial’s wondrous transcendence,
Preserve my fortune and integrity!"*

After the invocation, knock the teeth thirty-six times again. Only then may one execute and vanquish talismanic demons, subdue the myriad gods, and cause the qi to sweep away cold spirits, capturing and subduing the Six Heavens. Thus, a thousand demons and ten thousand poisons self-destruct before the invocation is even completed.

This invocation of the *Majestic King* is both wondrous and weighty, treasured by the loftiest perfected beings. Its text is concealed above the *Jade Clarity of the Nine Heavens*, upon the *Western Numinous Terrace of the Supreme Primordial*. The statutes of its sacred prohibition forbid its transmission to the world—unless it is the great method of the *Feathered Register of the Golden Name Kings*.

Those who overflow with dark blessings shall never behold the great method of the *Majestic King*. Only those who ascend to the ranks of the loftiest immortals, becoming ministers of the *Upper Clarity* or guests of the *Imperial Dawn*, may don and bear this talisman. When the adept merely begins the great invocation, the exalted ranks of immortals align their reins, the Celestial Emperor dances in the heavens, the golden perfected hasten as swift couriers, luminous essences seize their attendants, the dark dragon spews its venom, the divine tiger roars to the right, ten thousand demons are beheaded and annihilated, a thousand specters are rebuked and slain. The Six Heavens crumble before it, mountains and peaks bow in audience, jade radiance fills the chambers, purple youths turn their canopies, the Heavenly Sovereign lends his might, the Nine Empyreans attain dark tranquility. Baneful poisons and cold vapors dissolve, water attacks and fire assaults sweep away a thousand billion hills, the Eight Voids surge open. Thus, the spirit is at peace and the qi harmonized, without obstruction or stagnation. The golden luminaries align with the dawn, the numinous immortals unite in accord, and the adept, bearing this divine talisman, receives dark blessings for ten thousand generations.

*The Jade Luminance of the Nine Heavens, Golden Empyrean Majestic Spirit King, Supreme Primordial Great Tiger Talisman*

Should the adept encounter urgent peril or be seized by terror and trembling, let them secretly invoke the name of the *Central King of Luminous Essence* thrice, visualizing the deity as if standing guard to their left and right. Then, a thousand calamities and ten thousand misfortunes shall all be averted, treacherous trials extinguished, and malevolent poisons annihilated. Furthermore, upon retiring each night, let the adept knock their teeth fourteen times and recite the deity’s name, ensuring the hun and po are safeguarded and anchored, corpse-demons sealed away, and nightmares and inauspicious omens dispelled.

The transmission of this scripture requires master and disciple to face one another in purification for twenty-one days, concluding the transmission at day’s end. The covenant employs plain silk and azure silk, each thirty-seven feet in length, and a pair of golden fish, each weighing one tael, as the ritual implements of the *Supreme Primordial Western Numinous Treasure Prohibition*. These offerings of faith shall be presented at the gates of the Grand Master and Dharma Master to serve the public use of the numinous spirits. Should one privately withhold or embezzle them for personal gain, coveting profit in violation of the celestial statutes and betraying the great trust pledged at the outset of the covenant, the master shall be tormented in the *Northern Dark Prison* by the Seven Mysteries’ ancestors, forever barred from immortal fruition.

The method for bearing this talisman is as follows: inscribe it in cinnabar on white silk, three feet in length, and encase it in a purple brocade pouch to be worn over the heart. When performing divine invocations, the adept must wear it. Bearing this talisman, the adept commands the spirits of heaven and earth, drives out the cold essences of the Six Heavens, and crushes the malevolent qi of the Nine Demons. The adept’s lifespan extends beyond heaven and earth, their destiny entwined with the loftiest immortals of the *Great Ultimate*. The numinous talisman descends upon their form, and the great method of the *Majestic King* is arrayed. Divine officials bow in reverence, golden warriors provide escort, water and fire alike are traversed unscathed—behold the enduring efficacy! Thus, the Three Officials and the Northern Emperor dare not intrude upon its interstices.

Once the adept receives the divine scripture, they must treasure and recite it in morning rites, but may not wear it openly among mortals. Should one recklessly divulge the sacred text or reveal the name of the *Majestic King*, the Supreme shall inflict torment upon the Seven Mysteries’ ancestors, and the adept’s soul and embryo shall be devoured by the *Divine Tiger’s* maw, their hun and po sealed in hell, their body and life extinguished by the punishments of water and fire. For seven hundred years, they shall be reborn in the womb of a wart-ridden fetus, afflicted with leprosy, bringing suffering to nine generations of kin. If master or disciple lightly transmits this scripture or recklessly receives it, their punishment shall be the same.

On the day of ascension to immortality, the adept shall bear the *Huoluo* divine scripture to pay homage at the *Upper Palace*. Inscribe it in cinnabar on white silk, seven feet in length, and fold it to a width of five inches, resembling a sash. Use plain silk or green silk, fourteen feet in length, to fashion a yellow-lined garment, following the talisman’s method, and bind it at the waist. This is the so-called *Phoenix Script Tiger Sash of the Huoluo Seven Primes*. Those who observe prolonged purification shall wear it on days of morning rites.

*The Huoluo Talisman*
*The Golden Tiger True Talisman of the Celestial Emperor of the Great Subtlety*

The *Golden Tiger True Talisman of the Celestial Emperor of the Great Subtlety* is concealed within the *Jade Palace of the Supreme Primordial’s Upper Luminance*, guarded by venomous beasts a myriad fathoms deep, striking demons to defend the scriptures. Seven thousand divine tigers stand ready at the Jade Gates, while three hundred *Western Flower Jade Maidens* scatter incense in the celestial courts, and the Five Elders oversee the registers, attending the perfected of the *Golden Dawn*. None but those inscribed in the *Jade Registers* and carved upon the *Three Clarities’* tablets may receive the *Inner Talisman of the Golden Tiger* or hear the *Jade Chapters of the Supreme*.

This talisman was originally carved within the *Jade Tablets of the Upper Clarity’s Wisdom Chapter*, comprising seven hundred thousand words of numinous sounds and Daoist wonders, their subtle meanings profound and elusive. Some conceal the hidden taboos of heavenly demons, others reveal the inner names of the myriad spirits, while still others resolve obscure allusions and doubts through jade-like tones. The *Lord of Lesser You* extracted this talisman and the method of its inner numinous power to command the spirits of heaven and earth—comprising a mere hundred words. This invocation is wondrously arcane, named the *Three Heavens’ Tiger Script, Supreme Primordial Upper Record*.

Those who receive it must first purify themselves for seventy days, presenting a *Golden Tiger Jade Bell*, thirty feet each of plain silk and dark silk, as the oath of the *Golden Perfected*, swearing a covenant before heaven and earth that it shall not be improperly transmitted. In accordance with the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles*, one may transmit it to three persons over seven hundred years.

The *Golden Tiger Jade Essence True Talisman of the Celestial Emperor of the Great Subtlety* is the natural inner fragrance of the *Supreme Primordial’s Upper Luminance Golden Seal*. It commands the golden immortals, seals mountains, summons clouds, terrifies the Six Heavens, and beheads the myriad spirits. The Supreme constantly deploys the *Seventy Thousand of the Western Numinous Great Yi* to guard the talisman within the *Jade Palace of the Great Subtlety*. Those who bear this talisman wield authority over heaven and earth, rebuking and commanding the multitude of spirits, steering luminous dragons, and presiding as high immortals. Once the *Central Jade Tone* resounds, jade radiance attends at their side, golden warriors stand guard, a thousand demons lose their sight, ten thousand ghosts are obliterated, the Nine Demons bow their heads, the Six Heavens collapse, the Dao attains its ultimate perfection, and the spirits gather the Five Numinous. To the left, the dark youths howl; to the right, the *Golden Dawn* is seized. Great indeed is this sacred text, the majestic truth of the Celestial Emperor! It is not merely for dispelling poisons, averting trials, or annihilating demons—it is the wondrous treasure of immortal seeking, the standard of attaining the true.

The *Right Golden Tiger True Talism* was transmitted by the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity to the Emperor Lord of the Golden Tower. Inscribe it in cinnabar upon white silk, enclose it in a purple brocade pouch, and wear it upon the head while traveling—thus shall you command heaven and earth and the multitude of spirits, and the immortals shall revere and submit. Jade radiance shall scatter like a turban, celestial soldiers shall guard your body, and mountain warriors shall present their essence. Invoke the incantation of divine authority and the jade-spirit’s decree, and you shall decapitate and rejoice, the Nine Demons shall be vanquished, and a thousand demons shall be obliterated. This is a supreme talisman of the Highest Clarity, not to be disseminated in the world. Whoever wears it shall ascend in flight to the Highest Clarity.

The *Inner Incantation of the Majestic Divine Power of the Golden Truth of the Supreme Primordial Luminous Scene* is employed to dispatch the divine soldiers of the right, slaying and annihilating evil souls. Upon entering the chamber, burn incense, strike the teeth thirty-six times, and sit or recline at will. Then recite the incantation:

*"Expel the Poison King of Qian, the Trembling Crimson Banner,
Eight Immortals wielding halberds, the Five Numinous of the Supreme Lord,
The Supreme Mystery’s falling radiance, the Seven Dawns guarding the court,
The Yellow Truth’s resplendent talisman, flaming bells cast forth,
Divine tigers bristling with fury, venomous blades wildly displayed,
The Purple Effulgent Pattern, four leaping forms bowing in submission,
The Nine Heavens and Six Heavens, the Four Heavens’ luminous clarity,
Externally enwrapped in primordial qi, internally guarded by the master’s soldiers,
Leftward authority, rightward vigilance, wind’s assault and fire’s campaign,
Rebuking and slaying ten thousand demons, crushing and decapitating a thousand spirits,
The Golden Heaven’s majesty trembles.
The Nine Demons, their forms seized, are delivered to the Northern Feng,
Crushed and cast down, adorned for annihilation, all shall collapse.
I wear the true talisman and thereby command the myriad spirits,
The Three Origins proclaim the Dark Convergence of the Emperor’s sincerity,
The Supreme Mandate of the Grand Tenuity, ascending to the Three Clarities."*

The method of the *Inner Incantation of the Majestic Divine Power of the Supreme Primordial* is among the forbidden scriptures of the Highest Clarity.

The *Poison King of Qian* is the esoteric name of a great demon within the Six Heavens.
The *Trembling Crimson Banner* is the hidden taboo name of the Demon King of the Northern Emperor.
The *Four Heavens’ Luminous Clarity* is the soul-name of the ghost-ministers of the Northern Feng.
Whoever knows the names of these three demons shall cause a thousand demons to flee in terror, ten thousand ghosts to conceal their forms, and the Nine Demons to be powerless to move. Trials shall be unable to manifest.

When dwelling alone in mountains and forests or amidst the spirits and ghosts of talismanic temples, you may proceed with your affairs without needing to burn incense or enter a chamber. Alternatively, inscribe with orpiment upon green silk, three feet in length and one foot two inches in width—or else make it a square of one foot two inches. Outline its edges in cinnabar, and line its interior with red brocade. Wear it upon the right side of the waist. When ascending to the fast, entering the chamber, or attending the morning and evening audiences of the Eight Origins, or when subduing demons, summoning spirits, and commanding divine immortals, wear it and proceed with your affairs. Beware never to approach corpses or impurities, for it is a transgression. Should you divulge this secret, the Ancestor of the Seven Mysteries shall cast you into hell for torture.

Thus concludes the *Supreme Scripture of the Majestic Divine King of the Jade Luminance and the Golden Empyrean of the Nine Heavens*.
