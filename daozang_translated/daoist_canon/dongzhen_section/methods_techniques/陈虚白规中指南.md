**Scroll One: The First Principle—Stillness of the Mind**

*"When essence is full, do not lust after color;
When qi is full, do not crave food."*

*"The ears of a bright and clear man are sharp—
Hongjun’s gift, yet poverty he does not know.
Only by probing the Moon’s Cavern do things reveal themselves;
Only by following the Heavenly Root does one recognize humanity."*

*"When Heaven meets Xun, observe the Moon’s Cavern;
When Earth meets Lei, behold the Heavenly Root.
Between the Heavenly Root and Moon’s Cavern, one wanders freely—
Thirty-six palaces, all spring."*

○ *"When the thought arises, be instantly aware;
When aware, it vanishes—
The wondrous gate of cultivation lies here."*

*"This method is not complex; the Master teaches refinement:
So long as a single thread of thought remains unchecked,
Where shall you find its trace?"*

*"The state of no-thought is not like the dullness of earth, stone, or wood—
It is the stillness of *zhengnian* (正念, right awareness).*
*When right awareness manifests, light returns and illuminates—
It directs the rod to govern the qi,
It guides the qi back to the spirit.*
*The spirit condenses into a black mass—
Thus, mercury and lead are formed.*
*Seize the wild horse of the mind, tame the monkey of the heart—
Slowly refine the mercury and lead with diligent practice."*

*"The Great Dao teaches first to still the mind;
If thoughts persist, all effort is in vain."*

---

**Second Principle: Gathering the Elixir**

*"When the heart moves, the spirit cannot enter the qi;
When the body moves, the qi cannot enter the spirit—
Silently nurture the heart, and the spirit forgets its form."*

*"The gatherer of the elixir harvests the medicines within the body.
The medicines of the body are spirit, qi, and essence—
To gather them is to collect and store the mind and body,
To still the heart so that spirit and qi remain whole—
Thus, the furnace is established, the cauldron set,
And the divine pill is refined."*

---

**Third Principle: Recognizing the Furnace and Cauldron**

*"The Mysterious Female (玄牝)*
*The True Person plunges into the Deep Abyss."*

「Floating and Wandering in the Center of the Rules

*The Mysterious Female (玄牝),
Her whiteness like cotton, her continuity like a ring—
Though vast only by one inch and two *fen*,
She contains the essence of the entire body.*

To secure the longevity of the *Grain Spirit (谷神)*,
One must rely on the Mysterious Female as the foundation.
When the true essence returns to the *Yellow Court (黄金室)*,
A single luminous pearl forever remains.

**The Fourth Principle: Igniting the Elixir**
*Godly Vitality (神) is Fire,
Qi is the Elixir.*
Seize the central substance of the *Kan (坎)* position,
And kindle the *Yin (阴)* within the *Li (离)* palace’s embrace.
From this point onward, the body transforms into the *Qian (乾)* vitality—
Hidden yet soaring, all depends on the mind’s intent.

**The Fifth Principle: The Union of Kan and Li**
*Pursue the Two Qi (二炁) along the Yellow Dao (黄道),
Converge the Three Natures (三性) in the Primordial Palace (元宫).*
The *Lead Dragon (铅龙)* ascends, the *Mercury Tiger (汞虎)* descends.
Drive the Two Substances (二物) without letting them stray.
This union of *Kan* and *Li*—
Also called the *Small Heavenly Cycle (小周天)*.
Within the first hundred days of establishment,
One observes Fire and Water ascending and descending in the *Central Palace (中宫)*,
Yin and Yang blending in the *Alchemical Cauldron (丹鼎)*,
Clouds gathering, rain dispersing,
Qi condensing, spirit solidifying—
This is the verification.

*Zhongyuan’s True Person (紫阳真人)* said:
*"When the Dragon and Tiger unite in mutual affection,
Kan and Li meet, and conception begins.
A single ladleful of *Qian-Kun Essence (乾坤髓)*—
Focused intent, and its elixir is attained."*

**The Sixth Principle: The Union of Qian and Kun**
*Comparing the Barriers (比栏)*
*Upper and Lower Passes (上下关) in brief...*

「The Diagram is the Same
　　*Kan* and *Li* unite both internally and externally—
　　The Three Passes* become transparent without effort.
　　From the *Alchemical Field (Dan Tian)* to the *Marrow Gathering (Ni Wan Ding)*,
　　The *River Car (He Che)* moves freely countless times.

*Langran Zi* said:
　　The *Double Passes of the Spine (Jia Ji Shuang Guan)* pierce the *Gate of the Vertex (Ding Men)*—
　　This is the supreme path of cultivation.
　　Frequently swallow the *Divine Water of Hua Chi (Hua Chi Shen Shui)*,
　　The *Empress of the Purple Palace (Zi Fu Yuan Jun)* ascends directly.
　　Keep the *Qi* surging through the *Passes and Nodes (Guan Jie)*,
　　And naturally, *vital essence* will fill the *Grain of the Valley (Gu Shen)*.*

Once the *Path of the Long Sky (Chang Kong Lu)* is attained,
One must thank the teacher who first guided them.

**The Union of Qian and Kun is also called the *Great Heavenly Cycle (Da Zhou Tian)***.
It appears only after the union of *Kan* and *Li*—
For the medicine has already formed, and now it emerges.

The Right Secret says:
　　*Li* arises from beneath *Kan*,
　　*Dui* is born within the *Alchemical Cauldron (Dan Ding)*.
　　*Li* is Fire, *Kan* is Water,
　　*Dui* is Metal, and Metal is the Medicine.
　　This means igniting the Fire within Water,
　　To refine the Medicine in the Cauldron.
　　*Zhuangzi* says: "Fire within Water, and the Great Block* is formed."
　　*Yu Can* says: "A single point of *True Yang (Zhen Yang)* arises within *Kan*,
　　Filling the void of *Li* Palace."

*Creation and Transformation (Zao Hua)* proceed silently—
Fire rises within Water, like at the *Empty Peril Hole (Xu Wei Xue)*.
*Dan Yang’s True Person* says:
　　When Fire emerges from Water, cease all thoughts of scenery,
　　When Snow wraps around Flowers, extinguish all consciousness of Spring.
　　Such are its signs.

The *Spine (Jia Ji)* resembles a *cart axle*,
The four limbs like *mountain stones*,
The two kidneys like *boiling soup*,
The bladder like *searing heat*.
Within a single breath,
The *Heavenly Mechanism (Tian Ji)* moves on its own—
Lightly yet naturally, silently yet with *qi*,
Subtly guiding the mind to settle the breath,
Responding to the *pivotal mechanism of Creation and Transformation (Zao Hua Shou Ji)*,
Then Wood and Metal blend naturally,
Water and Fire ascend and descend naturally.
Suddenly, a single point grows large as a *millet pearl*,
Falling into the *Yellow Court (Huang Ting)*.
Using the method of *Refining Lead and Investing Mercury (Cai Qian Tou Gong)*,
Within a hundred days, one forms a day’s worth of elixir.

At this moment,
The body and mind merge with the void—
One does not know the body as oneself,
Nor oneself as the body.
One also does not know the spirit as *qi*,
Nor the *qi* as the spirit.
Such is Creation and Transformation—
Neither *visualization* nor *action*,
Yet naturally so, without knowing how.

*The Chapter on Restoring the Command (Fu Ming Pian)* says:
　　The *mud snake dances beneath the well*,
　　The *moonlight shines through the window on a plum*.
　　Last night, the *Chaos* collapsed into the earth,
　　And all ten thousand phenomena* are unknown.
　　The Seventh Principle: *Gathering and Condensing the Fire Refining (Zuan Cuo Huo Hou)*
　　*Upper Pillar of Heaven (Shang Zhu Tian)*, *Lower Pillar of Earth (Xia Zhu Di)*—
　　Only this is the *Cauldron Vessel (Ding Qi)*.
　　Once the method is known, the work is easy.
　　*Guard the Duty (Shou Zhi)*.」

At the beginning, the first nine:
*"Potential Dragon, Unused"*—do not act.
One Yang arises; guard stillness.
Mind must be sincere, heart steadfast.
Dragon’s virtue lies in concealment—do not advance lightly.

Advancing the Fire, the second nine:
*"Dragon Appears in the Field"*—rightly positioned.
Fan the gentle wind, refine the fire’s work.
In an instant, the cauldron glows red—
Dragon in the Field, traversing the void many times.

Adding the Fire, the third nine:
*"Persevering All Day"*—guard the achievement.
Heaven and Earth unite; yin and yang balance.
Eight parts mercury, half a *jin* of lead.
The maiden’s embrace, the infant’s gaze upward—
Bathing in purity.

The fourth nine, *"Leaping in the Abyss"*—double abyss.
Fire restrains fire; metal conquers wood.
At this stage, bathing is fitting.
Leaping in the abyss, preserve sincerity in solitude.

The fifth nine, *"Flying Dragon in Heaven"*—
The sixth nine, *"Soaring Dragon Overwhelms"*—
The seventh nine, *"Meeting"*—

The first six, *"Retreating"*—
The second six, *"Opposition"*—
The third six, *"Contemplation"*—
The fourth six—

The essence of mercury must ascend, the essence of lead must descend.
At this time, it is proper to guard with utmost caution.
Seal the bottom of the cauldron, bind its mouth tightly.
Retreat the fire—**戌 戌 剥**—
The fifth six: *"Yellow Robe, Supreme Good Fortune"*—return to its place.
Empty its heart, fill its belly.
Guard tranquility, await the return of yang.
Move for but a moment, and the full cycle is complete.

Wild battle—**亥 亥 坤**—
The sixth upper: *"Dragon Fights in the Wild"*—guard stillness.
When the group of yang is exhausted, the cinnabar light fades.
At the utmost refinement, the primordial *qi* rests.
Gather and settle within, *"Yellow Robe, Supreme Good Fortune."*

Nurture the fire—when yin is concealed, yang is reborn.
At this stage, vigilance is required.
If encountering *"Wild Battle,"* its blood will be dark and yellow.
The eighth stage: *"Yang Spirit Frees from the Fetal Shell"*—
Tip over the cauldron, overturn the furnace.
The work is complete, yielding the black pearl.
Return to the root, restore the command—embrace the origin and return to emptiness.

○ Three hundred days of fire, ten days of gestation.
Its spirit departs the body, coming and going in an instant.
Gazing back upon its former form, it is but a pile of dung.
At ten steps or a hundred steps, one must cautiously survey.
The child is young and not yet fully formed,
Relying on the nurturing virtue of its parents.

Nine years and three months, and all human affairs are exhausted,
Roaming the heavens and earth without constraint from kin.
The ninth stage: *"Forgotten Spirit Merges with Emptiness"*—
Though the spirit exists beyond the body, it is still not wondrous.
When the void is shattered into dust, only then does the whole body reveal itself.

○ The Supreme Dao/Way’s gate is known by few,
The profound and the original are indistinguishably alike.
Lifting the symbols of sun and moon to return to the primal form,
Leaping beyond the techniques of the world to perceive the Great Emptiness.
Refining until form and spirit both achieve perfection,
One then knows the beginning before parents were born.

Who conveys these truths? The Master without mouth teaches them to me.
Zhang Zhenren’s *解佩令*—
The yang spirit departs the body, dim and distant,
In a flash, it wanders unseen through the Three Islands.
Entering and exiting with pure familiarity,
Pressing and releasing as one seeks deeper mysteries.

Uniting with the True Emptiness, the Void is perfected—all is complete.

**Internal Alchemy’s Three Essentials**
The three essentials of internal alchemy are: **the Mysterious Mother (玄牝)**, medicinal substances, and fire regulation.
The *Dan Jing* says: *"Squeeze it for hidden meaning—yellow silk, a maiden in her youth."*
Let the reader ponder this.

I, though verbose, now speak plainly for all to understand.
Though my words are detailed, my intent is to clarify—
Each word is a true secret, revealed as if to a brother.
I conceal the mechanisms of transformation,
Piercing the marrow of yin and yang,
The unspoken mysteries of past and present—
All are here.

Like a whale swallowing the sea, the coral branches are fully exposed.

**Diagram of the Mysterious Mother**
The verse reads:

**Diagram of the Mysterious Mother**

The verse reads:
*"From the primal chaos, the round chaos is born—
Within it, secrets too profound to be told.
Split open the orifice within the orifice within,
Tread upon the heaven beyond heaven beyond.
Only when the Dipper’s handle reverses does form appear,
Only when the platform’s light returns does the immortal arise.
One morning, scooping the moon from the pond’s heart,
Piercing the Hu’s monk’s wall-gazing meditation—
All is revealed."*

---

**Diagram of Medicinal Substances**
The verse reads:
*"On Five-Skandha Mountain, snow lies thick and white,
Where deep in the clouds, fragrant herbs grow bright.
The Buddha of Vajra Sound plants them in due season,
While the Primordial Sovereign tends them with his own hands.
The Stone Maiden rides the dragon to pluck the two true roots,
The Wooden Man mounts the tiger to gather frost-dewed herbs.
Rich or poor, all households possess them—
Once discovered, return with but a single pound."*

---

**Diagram of Fire Regulation**
The verse reads:
*"The True Person of No Rank refines the Great Elixir,
Leaning on void, his long sword chills the air.
In the jade furnace, the Celestial Sovereign’s marrow is tempered,
In the golden cauldron, the Patriarch’s liver is simmered.
A hundred moments of cold and warmth, meticulously measured,
Six hexagrams of yin and yang—stillness holds the key.
Should one ask of the true furnace and crucible,
It is none other than the crimson flesh of today."*

---

**The Mysterious Mother**
*The Awakening to Reality* states:
*"To make the Valley Spirit eternal, one must rely on the Mysterious Mother as the foundation.
Once the true essence returns to the Yellow Room,
A single luminous pearl will never depart."*

The body contains one orifice, called the **Mysterious Mother**—
It receives *qi* to generate life and is truly the divine storehouse,
Where the Three Primordials converge without distinction.
Spirit, soul, and essence all gather here—
It is the root of the Golden Elixir’s return,
The sacred womb where immortals condense their embryo.

The ancients called it:
*The蒂 of the Supreme Ultimate, the handle of the Primordial, the root of the Void, the origin of Chaos, the Valley of the Great Emptiness, the source of Transformation, the Return-to-Root orifice, the Reclaim-Life Pass, the Steward-Earth Gate, the Regenerate-Heaven Chamber, the Gate of Jia-Yi, the Hall of Geng-Xin, the Door of Jia-Yi, the Southwest Quarter, the Abode of True Unity, the Central Yellow Chamber, the Dan Foundation, the One-Cultivation Altar, the Crescent Furnace, the Cinnabar Crucible, the Dragon-Tiger Den, the Yellow Granny’s Lodge, the Lead Furnace and Earthen Cauldron, the Divine Water and Flower Pool, the Imperial One’s Divine Chamber, the Soul’s Crimson Palace*—
All refer to the same place.

Yet within the body, it is neither mouth nor nose,
Neither heart nor kidney, neither liver nor lung,
Nor spleen, nor stomach, nor navel wheel,
Nor tailbone, nor bladder, nor the genital passage,
Nor the orifice between the two kidneys,
Nor the point one inch below the navel,
Nor the Clear Hall or the Mud Pillow,
Nor the Gate of Life or the Sea of Vitality.

Then where is it?
My secret technique is called **"the Center of the Rule"**—
With single-minded focus, the embryo-immortal is formed.

*The Classic of Harmony* says:
*"The True Person hides in the deep abyss,
Floating and guarding the Center of the Rule."*
This is its location.

*Laozi* says:
*"Much speech leads to exhaustion—
Better to guard the Center."*

It lies beneath *Qian*, above *Kun*,
West of *Zhen*, east of *Dui*—
The realm where *Kan* and *Li* (water and fire) copulate.

A human body is the very center of Heaven and Earth.
Eight vessels and nine orifices, veins and meridians converge here—
A vacant orifice, suspended like a millet grain,
Neither form nor substance, yet born of the Dao itself.
Seemingly present, yet absent;
Seemingly lost, yet existing—
Neither inside nor outside,
Yet containing *Qian* and *Kun* within.
The Yellow Center harmonizes with principle,
Residing in its proper position.

*The Book of Changes* says:
*"Only the pure and singular—
Firmly grasp the Center."*

*The Scripture of Guiding Others* says:
*"The Center harmonizes the Five *Qi*,
Merging with the Hundred Spirits."*

Master Cui called it *"Piercing the Tailbone, Communing with the Mud Pillow."*
Pure Yang named it *"The Origin of Life’s Breath, the First Reception of Qi."*

Master Ping said:
*"I urge you to seek the origin of life’s breath."*

This is where the Primordial *Qi* arises,
Where the true breath originates.
Thus, Yuè Chán also called it *"The place where the mind moves."*

Those who cultivate the Elixir, if they fail to understand this orifice,
Will not stabilize the true breath—
And immortality will remain unattained.

For this orifice precedes the Primordial and interfaces with the Post-Heavenly.
The two *Qi*s—Primordial and Post-Heavenly—
Together form the Chaos.
Faint and obscure, yet within it lies essence;
Vague and indistinct, yet within it lies substance.
Not ordinary substance, nor ordinary essence.
Heaven obtains it to remain clear,
Earth obtains it to remain tranquil,
Humans obtain it to become spiritually alive.

Master Tan said:
*"Obtaining the gate of the boundless *Qi*—
Thus returning to the root;
Knowing the sac of the Primordial Spirit—
Thus concealing its radiance.
Like the pearl within the oyster,
Like the gem within the stone—
This is the true meaning."*

Yet this orifice has no boundaries, no inside or outside.
If one seeks it through form, color, or appearance,
One will only err greatly.

Thus it is said:
*"Do not cling to non-action,
Nor fixate on form,
Nor dwell on visualization,
Nor obsess over maintenance."*

The sages modeled it in the *Dan Jing*.
Some say it is *"the high rise within the Mysterious"*—
Like a gourd, tightly sealed, where the spirit moves.
Others say it is *"like a chicken’s egg"*—
Black and white supporting each other,
An inch in breadth and length,
The beginning of all things,
Expanding over ten months,
Breaking free from its shell.

Still others say it is *"white as silk, connected like a ring"*—
An inch and two tenths in breadth and length,
Enclosing the essence of the entire body—
This clearly demonstrates the key to the Mysterious Pass,
Revealing the mechanism of Transformation.

Scholars who fail to fathom its depth,
Who do not grasp its subtlety,
At the time of practice,
Take the gourd as the gourd,
The egg as the egg,
The ring as the ring—
Clinging to forms, fixating on illusions—
How could this not be a grave mistake?

Know that the Mysterious Pass, the gate of the Mysterious Mother,
Is the foundation where immortals point to the workings of Transformation.

Yuè Chán said:
*"Seemingly present, yet not—
Where else but within oneself could it be settled?"*

Yet its essence and function are inherently unified,
Like *Qian* and *Kun* modeling Heaven and Earth,
*Li* and *Kan* embodying the sun and moon.

*The Classic of Harmony* says:
*"Where Chaos meets, the foundation is established."*

「Cultivate and nourish the *Yīn* and *Yōu*—
Concentrate the *shén* to form the vital frame.

Then the *shén* and *qì* have their place,
The soul and spirit do not stray in chaos,
The returning light and radiant reflection find their way—
Even in haste, they never leave the norm.

Its verse:
Cultivate the *Yīn* and *Yōu* as the void,
Enclose the Primordial Spirit within its form.
Inhaling and exhaling without pause,
The Whole Embryo perfected aligns with the Original Beginning.

Here lies the full meaning of the Mysterious Mother.

Yet further discussion:
The *Yǎo Lín* text states:
*"One aperture, the Mysterious Pass—
The critical path of the Three Passes.
Sudden light movement, swift and unencumbered,
The Spirit-Water flows naturally."*

Again it says:
*"Below the heart, above the kidneys—
West of the liver, left of the lungs.
Not the intestines, nor the stomach’s chamber,
One *qì* flows freely through."*

Now I say:
The Mysterious Pass, the gate of the Mysterious Mother,
Lies at the center of one’s body—
Heaven and Earth’s domain.
Transformation and Creation inherently align here.

I have examined its teachings,
Though refined and clear,
They still lack the direct pointing of truth.

Heaven does not hoard the Dao—
It spreads through the world.
The Most High’s compassionate mercy,
Necessarily cannot be confined by strict adherence.

I dare to purify and reveal the leaked Heavenly secrets,
To elucidate the Mysterious Pass’s core intent,
Breaching the prohibition to share,
So that the body and essence may unite.

Aspiring cultivators of the Dao,
Upon first reading, will grasp its profundity—
Mind and Spirit in accord,
Seal it in practice, each word resonating.

This text is everywhere,
Guarded by sacred essences.
If one’s karma is heavy and blessings meager,
With no affinity for the Dao,
They will encounter this secret yet doubt its truth.
It is but the scribblings of the blind,
The hollow sounds of the deaf.

The Mysterious is yet more Mysterious—
How could they ever comprehend it?

The secret speech declares:

A finger’s breadth of substance,
Mingles the Three Realms.
Above the kidneys,
[Situated] below the heart,
Vaguely within—
This is called the Mysterious Pass.

One must not guard it with deliberate intent,
Nor seek it without intent.
If one guards it with intent,
One will never attain it.
If one seeks it without intent,
One will find only its absence.

How then can one succeed?
It is when the will is undivided,
That the spirit congeals.

Only by stilling the heart and severing thoughts,
Adjusting the breath to evenness,
Silently ever-present,
Must one not let it grow dim.

When the qi is tranquil and harmonious,
The True Person enters *ding*,
Within this *ding*,
Observing the inner landscape.

As soon as intention arises,
The sign begins to stir.
One perceives a breath,
Rising from the *gui*.
Mingled and continuous,
Stable yet surging—
Nurture it with sincerity,
Listen with the heart.
The Six Roots settled,
Fetal breathing congealed.

Neither closed nor counted,
Let it proceed naturally.
At utter stillness, a sigh—
Like fish in spring marshes;
At extreme motion, a yawn—
Like insects emerging from hibernation.
Yin and yang unfurling,
Its wonders boundless.

After some time,
One must forget the *qi* and merge with the spirit,
Returning to the undifferentiated chaos,
Reaching the utmost emptiness,
Guarding stillness with resolve—
The heart unmoved, no thoughts arising,
No coming, no going,
No entering, no exiting,
Serene and ever-present.

This is called the True Person’s breath at its foundation.
*Foundation* means its depth profound.
Spirit and *qi* interacting—
This is the sign.

What was spoken of earlier:
The origin of the Original *Qi*,
The rise of the True Breath.
Where intention reaches,
Creation manifests;
Where the breath arises,
There lies the Mysterious Pass.

Neither high nor low,
Neither left nor right,
Neither forward nor backward,
Neither slanted nor balanced—
A person’s body is the center of Heaven and Earth.
This is the true place.

Refinement and union occur here;
Smelting and bathing occur here;
Nurturing and gestation occur here;
Transcendence and rebirth occur here—
All within this.

If not plainly revealed,
Students will only guess wildly,
Either overreaching or falling short.

Zhongyang Zhuren said:
*"Even if your wisdom surpasses Yan Min,*
*Without a clear teacher, no guessing suffices.*
*For the alchemical canon lacks oral instructions,*
*Leaving you nowhere to forge the spirit embryo."*

Yet this orifice—
When *yang* expands and *yin* contracts,
Has no fixed form.
When intention arrives, it opens;
Opening and closing have their time.
In a hundred days, the foundation is set,
Nurturing the *qi*-mother,
The empty chamber births white—
This appears naturally.

Of old, the Yellow Emperor’s three-month inner observation—
This is the same Dao.

Below the navel,
Between the intestines,
Called the *Tingdu* Gate, the Nine Abysses,
Where the *Nine Hells* preside—
*Yin* filth accumulates,
True *yang* does not dwell.
Thus, the Sacred Treasures’ methods of refinement and liberation,
Meditating on this as the *Youguan*—
How could this be the path of cultivation?
Students must ponder this sincerely.

**Alchemical Medicines**
An ancient song says:
*"Ask how this body of mine is formed—*
*It does not depart from essence, *qi*, and spirit.*
*Now I reveal the truth of birth:*
*A single grain of primordial pearl—this is my kin."*

Spirit and *qi*, essence—
The three supreme medicines.
Refine essence into *qi*,
Refine *qi* into spirit,
Refine spirit into the Dao—
This is the key to the Seven Returns and Nine Reversions.

Red lead, black mercury,
Wood fluid, gold essence,
Cinnabar, quicksilver,
White gold, black tin,
Golden male, yellow female,
*Li* female, *Kan* male,
Azure tortoise, vermilion serpent,
Fire dragon, water tiger,
White snow, yellow shoots,
Jade pear, fire date,
Golden rooster, jade hare,
*Qian* horse, *Kun* ox,
Sun essence, moon dew,
Heavenly soul, earthly shadow,
River lead, gold furnace mercury,
Water gold, fire wood,
*Yin* within *yang*, *yang* within *yin*,
Black within white, male enfolding female—
Countless names, all metaphors.

Then what are these medicines?
It is said:
The essence of cultivation lies in the *Xuan Dan*,
To establish the *Xuan Dan*, first fortify the root.
The root’s foundation—
This is Original Essence.
Essence is the transformation of Original *Qi*,
Thus essence and *qi* are one.
When Original Spirit resides within,
The three converge as one.

Xinglin said:
*"All things born must die,*
*Original Spirit dies yet lives again.*
*When Spirit returns to the *qi* within,*
*The alchemical Dao naturally succeeds."*

Shi Jianwu said:
*"Qi is the medicine that prolongs life,*
*The heart directs the *qi* and Spirit.*
*If one knows the master of *qi*-cultivation,*
*Then one has attained the Dao of the Immortals."*

If essence is depleted, *qi* will fail,
If *qi* fails, Spirit will wander.
The *Yijing* says:
*"Essence returns to matter,*
*Wandering Spirit becomes transformation."*

To restore the root—
Is this not difficult?

Yuxi Zi said:
*"With the Original Essence’s unrefined Original *Qi*,
And the most refined Spirit,
Then Spirit shines with luminosity,*
*Its transformations boundless—*
*This is called Spirit."*

All speak of the medicines within the body,
Not relying on external substances.

Yet the birth of medicines has its sources,
Gathering them has its seasons,
Preparing them has its methods,
Administering them has its transformations,
Refining them has its fire functions.

I once heard from my teacher:
*"In the southwest lands,*
*A place called Huangting—*
*Vaguely, something exists,*
*Dimly, a spirit lingers.*
*Plainly, one medicine of water-gold,*
*Seek it only in the Flower Pool."*

This is the source of the medicines.

Drawn curtains seal *Dui*,
Silencing the breath’s harmony,
Abandoning form and wisdom,
Near the state of *zuowang*.
I urge you to remain all day like the foolish,
Refining a single *ruyi*-pearl.

This is the season for gathering medicines.

Before Heaven and Earth,
Rootless spirit-herbs,
With single-minded intent,
Producing the supreme treasure.
The Great Dao does not depart from the inch of land—
Cultivation’s work must be meticulous and steadfast.

This is the method of preparing medicines.

Heart without heart,
Thought without thought,
Attention focused within the *gui*,
Merging into one *qi*.

It is also said:
*"Breath after breath, unbroken,*
*Walking, sitting—transformations manifest."*

This is the transformation of administering medicines.

「Refine the medicinal materials in stillness and quietude,
Concentrate meticulously to form pills.
Within the twelve hours,
Silence all thought and boil with the *fire of Dao*.

Keep the golden cauldron’s broth ever warm,
Never let the jade furnace’s flame grow cold.
This is the Dao/Way of refining medicinal *fire*.

Essentially, the *Xuan Dan* (玄牝) is the origin of yin and yang,
The dwelling of spirit and *qi*.
Spirit and *qi* are the elixir of nature and life,
The root of prenatal breathing (*taixi* 胎息),
The progenitor of inhalation and exhalation,
The path of deep-rooted and firm establishment.

The womb is the repository of the spirit,
Breath is the primordial element for transforming the womb.
The womb depends on breath to form,
Breath depends on the womb to sustain.
Without breath, the womb cannot manifest,
Without the womb, the spirit has no master.

Before a person is born,
Vast and formless as the boundless void,
When parents unite in essence,
The first signs appear—
A single point begins to congeal,
Purely the essence of nature and life.
For three months in chaotic unity,
The *Xuan Dan* (玄牝) stands firm.

Once the *Xuan Dan* (玄牝) is established,
It clings like a melon’s stem.
The infant in the womb,
Silently draws upon the mother’s *qi*.
When the mother inhales, the child inhales,
When the mother exhales, the child exhales—
All movements, inner and outer,
Respond in harmony.
No perception, no cognition,
No clarity, no awareness.
The *qi* of Heaven is vast and boundless,
The *qi* of Earth is deep and obscure,
Yet one breath remains.

At the appointed time, birth occurs—
Heaven and Earth reverse,
The person is startled as the fetal sac breaks,
Like one who stumbles atop the Great Mountain’s peak,
Head dangling, feet propped,
Emerging with a great cry—
The breath is then forgotten,
And thus cannot be retained in full.

Moreover, disturbances agitate the mind,
Cleverness dazzles the eyes,
Affection leads the emotions,
Desire corrupts the nature—
All these scatter the original purity,
Dissolving it into myriad things.

Once the womb’s single breath is lost,
It can never be guarded again.

The Dao/Way of immortals teaches refining essence,
To return to the origin,
Restore the beginning,
Regenerate the five *zang* organs,
Reform the physical body—
From formlessness to form,
Congealing into a sacred womb.

Its secret is:
*"Can you concentrate *qi* to such softness,
As to resemble an infant?"*
*"Abandon all thoughts and stop all distractions,
Guard the One with a tranquil heart—
External thoughts do not enter,
Internal thoughts do not escape,
All day in chaotic unity,
As if still in the mother’s womb."*

When the spirit is settled,
It gathers with the *qi*.
When the *qi* is harmonized,
It merges with the spirit.
The spirit congeals into *qi*,
The *qi* sustains as spirit.

In the realm of still repose,
Vaguely, in the land of *wuheyou* (无何有),
Heaven’s heart is obscure,
Focusing on a single orifice—
Like a hen brooding an egg,
Or a fish in water,
Exhaling to the root,
Inhaling to the stem—
Continuous as if ever-present,
Again guarding the womb’s single breath.

Guard nothing, yet the true breath abides,
Vanished as if nonexistent,
Though the heart is within the heart,
No trace remains to cling to.
In the boundless void,
Only the boundless spirit is sovereign over transformation.
When the time arrives,
The subtle principles reveal themselves—
Lightly, effortlessly, they move,
Silently, naturally, they arise.
With subtle intent, stabilize the *qi*,
Responding to the pivot of transformation—
Then metal and wood blend naturally,
Water and fire ascend and descend in harmony.
Suddenly, a single point grows large as a millet seed,
Falling into the Yellow Court (黄庭).

This is the moment for gathering *lead-mercury* (铅汞),
Forming one day’s elixir within one day’s cycle.
The *Fuhe Pian* (复合篇) says:
*"At night, chaotic unity collapses to the earth,
Ten thousand phenomena rise in orderly array, yet all are unknown."*

At this time,
The body is in perfect unity with the void,
Unknown whether spirit is *qi*,
Unknown whether *qi* is spirit—
Such is the transformation’s Dao,
Not one of deliberate cultivation.

These are all the Dao/Way’s natural principles,
I too do not know how they are so.
Once the medicine is born,
The *fire* emerges naturally.
Essentially, the medicine’s birth—
Small, it can harmonize with the *Kan Li* (坎离) transformations,
Great, it can align with the *Qian Kun* (乾坤) movements.
The intent of the *Golden Elixir* (金丹)
Is fully revealed here.
How could lesser methods compare?

If you do not trust me,
Abandon *Xuan Dan* (玄牝) and seek external foundations,
Pursue external spirit and *qi* while searching for medicinal substances—
Unaware of the natural womb and breath,
Yet recklessly applying the *fire*’s stages,
Discarding the root for the branches,
Chasing illusions while lost in truth,
Heaven will strip your control—
I have no way to help you.

The ancient song on *fire*’s stages says:
*"The Sage transmits medicine, not fire,
From ancient times, few know the stages of fire."*

What does "not transmit" mean?
It is not that the fire is kept secret.
For when gathering medicines, it is called *medicine*,
Yet within the medicine lies the *fire*.
When refining, it is called *fire*,
Yet within the fire lies the *medicine*.
If one knows the medicine and takes the *fire*,
The elixir will naturally form—
There are those who need not be taught to know.

The verse says:
*"Medicinal substances contain yin within yang,
The stages of fire contain yang within yin.
Mastering yin and yang’s intent,
Then the stages of fire become clear in one place."*
This is its profound meaning.

Later generations, confused by alchemical texts,
Cannot instantly awaken—
Hearing of *twenty-four breaths* (二十四炁),
*seventy-two stages* (七十二候),
*twenty-eight constellations* (二十八宿),
*sixty-four hexagrams* (六十四卦),
*twelve divisions of heavenly influence* (十二分野),
*day-moon conjunction* (日月合璧),
*tide-like rising and falling* (海潮升降),
*eternal life’s three mysteries* (长生三昧),
*yang texts and yin strategies* (阳文阴武)—
They must investigate which is *fire*,
Which is the *stage*.
Exhausting their minds in a lifetime,
They cling to endless appearances—
Though they grasp the true medicinal substances,
They hesitate, not daring to refine them.

Little do they know:
The true *fire* has no stages,
The supreme medicine requires no measure.

The *Yue Chan* (玉蟾) says:
*"Fire originates from the southern *Li* (离) hexagram,
Belonging to the heart.
The heart is the spirit,
The spirit is the fire,
The *qi* is the medicine.
To refine medicine with fire into elixir
Is to govern *qi* with spirit to attain the Dao."*
Its teachings are so clear,
So direct and unobstructed.
Those lacking innate immortal constitution
Mock it as empty words,
Passing it by in plain sight—
Deeply lamentable.

Yet the essence of the *fire*’s stages’ incantation
Must be sought within the true breath.

For breath arises from the heart,
When the heart is tranquil, the breath is harmonized,
Each breath returns to its root—
The mother of the *Golden Elixir*.

The *Xin Yin Jing* (心印经) says:
*"The returning wind unites in harmony,
Its efficacy is revealed in a hundred days’ cultivation—
This is the true breath."*

「The *Rù Yào Jìng* (《入药镜》) states:
*"To awaken the *Xùn* (巽) wind,
To circulate the *Kūn* (坤) fire,
To enter the *Yellow Chamber* (黄房),
And forge the *Supreme Treasure* (至宝)—
This is the way."*

The *Hǎi Chán Wēng* (海蟾翁) speaks of:
*"Opening and closing the *Tiān Kūn* (乾坤) power of creation,
Smelting a furnace of true *Rén* (真) sun and moon—
This is the way."*

What does it mean by *"the True Person* (真人) *plunges into the deep abyss,
And drifts in the *Guī* (规) without straying"*?

It is necessary to govern *qi* (炁) with spirit (神),
To steady *qi* (炁) with breath (息),
As the *Tuó Ruò* (橐钥) opens and closes,
And as *Yīn* (阴) and *Yáng* (阳) ascend and descend—
Inhaling and exhaling, let it be natural.

Focus *qi* (炁) to attain softness (柔),
Retain the light in silent stillness (含光默默),
In all actions—moving, resting, sitting, lying—
Continuously nurture as though it were ever-present.

Like a woman carrying a child,
Like a small dragon nurturing its pearl.
Gradually refining, gradually smelting,
Gradually condensing, gradually forming—
When the practice is pure and complete,
It merges into one.

Between motion and stillness,
It is more fitting to *xiāo-xī* (消息).

Do not let thoughts arise,
For thoughts arise, and the fire will flare.
Do not let the mind stray,
For the mind strays, and the fire will chill.
Only ensure it neither exceeds nor falls short,
Balancing the holding and releasing with moderation—
Spirit embracing *qi* (炁),
*Qi* (炁) embracing spirit,
With singular intent, blending harmoniously,
Enveloping the *Hún Dùn* (混沌).

This is called *"the continuity of the fire-seed* (火种),
And the *Dan Dǐng* (丹鼎) ever-warm—
No moment of interruption,
No slightest deviation.
To refine in such a manner for an instant,
Is a full *Zhōu Tiān* (周天) of that instant.
To refine in such a manner for a time,
Is a full *Zhōu Tiān* (周天) of that time.
To refine in such a manner for a day,
Is a full *Zhōu Tiān* (周天) of that day.
Refining for a hundred days is called *establishing the foundation* (立基).
Refining for ten months is called *the embryonic immortal* (胎仙).
Until the *Yuán Hǎi* (元海) gives birth to *Yáng* (阳),
And fire arises within water—
The cycles of heaven and earth revolve,
The *Tiān Kūn* (天乾) alternate,
Yet all remain within a single breath.

How much more so when it comes to *mù yù* (沐浴) and *wēn yǎng* (温养),
Advancing and withdrawing, extracting and adding—
Within these lies the profound alignment with *heavenly mechanism* (天机),
The subtle correspondence with creation’s design,
Yet it does not rely on our own strength.

Thus it is said:
*"Though fire has its stages,
No need for contrived manipulations."*

I know not of the *Wùzhǔ* (子午) *method*,
Nor of the *huì-míng* (晦明) *phases* or *shéng-zuò* (弦朔) *nodes*,
Nor of the divisions between *winter solstice* (冬至) and *summer solstice* (夏至),
Nor of the distinctions between *Yīn* (阴) fire and *Yáng* (阳) symbols,
Nor of the claim that within twelve hours, only one hour suffices,
Nor of the secret that within three hundred days, only half a day is needed,
Nor of the notion that years, months, days, and hours must be amassed.
If one speaks of timing,
Then all twelve *shēn* (辰) moments are as the mind directs.
If one speaks of its marvel,
Then an instant’s practice holds a year’s stages.

Only let the spirit rest in natural ease—
This is the *master’s* (先师) true teaching.
Day and night, the *Lún* (屯) and *Méng* (蒙) unfold naturally—
Why tirelessly observe the fire’s stages?
This is the *master’s* (先师) definitive principle.

Ah! The *sages’* (圣人) intent—
To transmit the *medicine* (药) but not the *fire* (火)—
Is fully revealed here.

The verse says:
*"The seeker needs no laborious teacher,
For this book alone reveals the Dao’s mystery.
Though iron shoes may be worn to dust in search,
The treasure comes with effortless ease."*

Postscript.

The spirit has no fixed form, the *Dao* no fixed shape.
What is called the *play of the Mystic Pass*—
merely a method to
**let the spirit guide the *qi* and the *qi* return to the spirit,**
**to turn the light inward and gather the wandering thoughts.**

Master Yùxī said:
*"To take uprightness and sincerity as the central pillar—*
this is the way."

What is called *medicine* and *fire’s stages*
are but metaphors.

For the essence of the Great *Dao* lies beyond
all contrivance of mind, knowledge, or intent.

But know this:
Within the body, there is a sovereign of creation—
and *Dao* is simply what is *mine* in this moment.

If one knows this,
taking stillness as foundation and clarity as base,
then in an instant’s turn, the *heavenly mechanism* moves of its own accord—
**without deliberate regulation, yet regulation is complete;**
**without forced breath-retention, yet breath-retention is natural;**
**medicine is not sought, yet it arises;**
**fire is not summoned, yet it emerges—**
all are the marvelous workings of nature.

How could it depend on
**fixing the mind, straining the body,**
**letting knowledge or intent labor for the *Dao*?**

When one arrives at this ultimate truth,
words may be forgotten.
