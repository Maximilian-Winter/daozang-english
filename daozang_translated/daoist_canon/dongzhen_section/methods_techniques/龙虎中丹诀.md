**The Dao of the Primordial Essence**
The Dao of the Original Beginning, the wondrous root of harmony,
Undifferentiated, dispersing the Two Principles—
Qi descends, giving birth to myriad things.
Life and death’s control, flowing ceaselessly—
The subtle mechanism of the Great Mystery—
Who can truly fathom it?

To perceive form is the Dao;
To forget form is to attain the Dao.

Only the *jing* [essence] governs the master of the body,
Only the *qi* embodies the true nature of the body,
Only the *shen* [spirit] embodies the numinous soul of the body.
The three—*jing*, *qi*, *shen*—
Only the heart can move, unite, and transform them.

The utmost essence of sun and moon, heaven and earth—
The elixir of the *kan* [water] and *li* [fire] within the human body—
Let *kan* and *li* copulate.
When the sun enters the *xuan gong* [dark palace],
And the true elixir is forged,
One witnesses the creation of heaven and earth,
And knows the pivot of life and death.

When form is abandoned and spirit is transformed,
In perfect harmony with the Great Void—
This is the supreme essence of the True Immortal.

Return to the root, restore the origin—
Son follows mother, before the father—
Practice the *fu* [return] cycle of *Qian* [Heaven],
And naturally encounter the completion of *Kun* [Earth].

He who obtains this elixir:
For six years, forgets sound, color, emotion, and desire,
Abandons the myriad distractions,
And by the ninth year,
The elixir is perfected, the embryo transforms—
Thus becoming a True Immortal.
Ascending into the formless.

If one receives it from a master:
First, purify the heart and body through fasting,
Offer prayers to the heavens above,
And place the words "life" and "death" in a contest.
If "life" is chosen, the will of Heaven is in accord—
Then engrave on metal or stone,
Swear with blood oaths and inscriptions,
Transcribe the elixir scriptures,
Pass down the oral instructions,
And the seal, incantations, and ritual methods.
If given to the unworthy,
Heaven’s will diverges—
The reckless transmitter bears guilt upon the Nine Ancestors.

**Guard this secret!**
**Beware!**

**Do not forget Heaven’s sincerity.**

**The Ode of the Dragon and Tiger’s Interaction**
Wondrous! Thirty spokes converge,
Each spoke unified at the hub,
Before and after the child—
Yin and Yang never pause.

At the moment of Heaven and Earth’s creation,
The Dragon and Tiger meet at the fifth and sixth hours,
When the work is complete and the ascension day arrives,
Only then shall you believe the speed of the Returned Elixir.

**The Ode of the Embryo’s Chamber**
What is most excellent?
The Original Essence, eternal as sun and moon,
The Elixir Field deep within the rain,
The Mysterious Mother enfolding frost upon the head.

True Black congeals as the chamber,
Numinous Sand solidifies as the hall—
In still contemplation, the Sacred Principle is attained,
The single Essence pure, beyond the ordinary.

**The Ode of Embryonic Yang**
The Five Bandits see what flourishes,
The Mysterious Origin’s work is clear—
The Sacred Elixir’s birth brings flavor,
The Numinous Liquid’s emanation is fragrant.

Within the abdomen, the splendor of Heaven and Earth,
In the cauldron, the eternal sun and moon—
Once you grasp the True Method,
The single *qi* rings clear and resonant.

**The Ode of the Divine Embryo**
To attain the transformation of the Divine Embryo,
You must first secretly preserve the Essence.
The Six Dragons race through the film of life,
The Single Horse gallops with the wind’s roar.

The mind escapes the Red Dust in haste,
The body soars through the Green Void with ease—
But if you cultivate this resolve,
Soon you shall reach the Penglai Isles.

**The Ode of the Embryo’s Spirit**
To seek the Embryo’s Spirit,
First endure the bitter refinement of form.
One True Essence has its master,
Three Masters naturally ascend.

The Heterodox Bones turn golden,
The Immortal Cauldron refines the Polar Star—
When you awaken this work,
Do not weary of reading the *Huangting*.

**The Ode of Embryonic Transformation**
On the day when the work is complete and form is forgotten,
When the Embryo seeks to transform—
Auspicious light arises in the Outer Chamber,
Divine Water flows from the Lotus Pool.
Heavenly music is heard at dawn,
Yin Demons wail and depart at night.
Turning back to thank your birth in the mortal world,
Ordinary bones shall not follow.

**The True Fire Incantation**
Yang Essence, Yang Essence,
Come to safeguard my body—
My embryo is already numinous,
Uniting with its True Essence.
As it is, so it shall be done. **Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Command.**

**The True Water Incantation**
Great Yin, Mysterious Essence,
Become my Embryo’s Spirit—
Calm its soul and spirit,
Guard and protect its True Form.
As it is, so it shall be done. **Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Command.**

**The Circulation of the Microcosmic Orbit Ritual**

The **Microcosmic Orbit** completes three hundred sixty-five cycles,
matching the days of the sun and moon in a year—
leap days accumulated within, culminating in the inner realm,
where the Four Symbols are activated by the Five Phases.

For the Five Phases manifest in the Four Seasons,
here they are fully revealed:

**Zhen (Thunder, East)**
On the Spring Equinox, at the *Mao* hour (5–7 AM),

conduct the Fire nine times—
each time swallow eleven mouthfuls from the Lotus Pool,
totaling ninety-nine mouthfuls.

**Li (Flame, South)**
On the Summer Solstice, at the *Wu* hour (11 AM–1 PM),
face the south, recite the incantation three times,
conduct the Fire three times—
each time swallow twenty-seven mouthfuls from the Lotus Pool,
totaling eighty-one mouthfuls.

**Dui (Lake, West)**
On the Autumn Equinox, at the *You* hour (5–7 PM),
face the west, recite the incantation seven times,
conduct the Fire seven times—
each time swallow ten mouthfuls from the Lotus Pool,

totaling seventy-two mouthfuls.

**Kan (Water, North)**
On the Winter Solstice, at the *Zi* hour (11 PM–1 AM),
face the north, recite the incantation five times,
conduct the Fire five times—
each time swallow twenty mouthfuls from the Lotus Pool,

totaling one hundred eighty mouthfuls.

**The Fire Incantation**
*"Yùyí jié lún, yùpèi jīnchēng,
liújīn huǒlíng, jíjí rúlǜ lìng."*

**Dragon-Tiger Elixir: Water-Fire Central Dan in Nine Stages**

**First Year**
The Sacred Embryo now stands—
the Dao immortal may be sought.
Golden Essence leaps, surging past the Passes,
First banishing the heart’s killing Yin Demons,
then the Heart Channel’s rising Lotus Pool Waters.
Yin and Yang clash, birthing wind and thunder—
soul and spirit soar, startling dreams and slumber.
Suddenly, the Six Organs show faint improvement,
and guarding the True Elixir heals ailments naturally.

**Second Year**
The Tortoise Pool awakens at night—
the Crimson Sun and Silver Hare surge from the depths.
Day reveals a body radiant with divine qi,
all bones free of disease, self-regulating.
Seated in darkness, divine light shines forth,
eyes flashing like sudden lightning.
In dreams, I embrace my elder brother-child,
this is the Second Transformation of the Returning Elixir.

**Third Year**
The True Elixir nears completion in a thousand days—
the Golden Pass and Jade Locks stand firm.
A thunderous roar boils the sea,
and the elixir’s essence moistens the joints.
The Lotus Pool drips like suspended pearls,
repeatedly brewed and rinsed into solidified ghee—
capable of healing others, easing suffering.
Ingested for a hundred days, it banishes all calamities.

**Fourth Year**
Detachment from sensory desires clears the mind,
the Three Fields and Six Organs glow like torches.
Daily, sacred fluids flow as jade ghee,
gradually shunning rich, pungent foods.
Earthly bones grow light, transforming into the Divine Chamber,
feet become childlike, as if sealed with lacquer.
Wrinkles smooth, hair regrows—
only then does the Daoist know the body’s true benefit.

**Fifth Year**
After five years, what then?
Though flavors taste sweet, they no longer harmonize...

**Sixth Year**
When true yang-qi thrives, one is ever sated—
all foods suit, yet fire is sparingly used.
Wine flows without measure, yet intoxication never comes;
its hue and luster sharpen, invigorating the spirit’s essence.
Each day, the Pearl of Joy turns with sacred grace,
and naturally, the body ascends to the Daoist’s rank.

**Seventh Year**
The elixir’s ninth transformation is no distant dream—
with steady gaze, one discerns the autumn hair’s thread at a hundred paces.
Why seek external remedies to reverse aging?
Old scars and blemishes dissolve without trace.
Without eating, the prenatal qi sustains—
this method escapes the logic of birth and death.
With resolute heart, a hundred days’ practice—
what marvels unfold? The first wondrous power, without a tear.

**Eighth Year**
Inner resolve aligns with the boundless void,
and all worldly attachments fade from the mind.
The Nine Parasites vanish, the Three Corpses perish,
and the soul no longer wanders—dreams cease entirely.
Yang-essence stands firm, nourishing the Spirit Storehouse,
and the four limbs fear neither cold nor heat.
One knows death and life are not to be weighed—
the Land of Purity is the Daoist’s path to transcendence.

**Ninth Year**
The prenatal Daoist’s spirit longs to take flight,
and celestial music drifts through stillness at will.
Common folk recoil at the sight of carrion’s stench,
yet divine radiance brightens one’s bearing naturally.
Earthly spirits appear in white robes daily,
while violet and crimson true mists fill the gaze.
This body suddenly transforms into fiery light—
and thus, the spirit departs the mortal frame.

The secrets of the Dragon-Tiger elixir are now complete.
