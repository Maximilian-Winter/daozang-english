### **Preface to *The Supreme Nine Essentials of the Heart-Seal Wondrous Scripture***
*Transmitted by the Immortal Zhang Guolao*

The "Nine Essentials" refer to the crucial mechanisms, corresponding to the nine transformations of the Great Elixir. Thus, the Dao is divided into nine chapters, and the method is revealed through nine gates. When the nine gates align with principle, each chapter returns to the root.

Though one may not receive the direct transmission of a master’s teachings, obtaining these essentials is as if receiving the master’s instruction. Those who attain them sit and grasp the celestial mechanism; those who awaken to them hold the heart-seal.

For practitioners who follow this path: abide in desire yet transcend desire, dwell in the world yet rise above it. The nine gates are established to return the Two Modes to their origin.

Scholars of the Dao, ponder these words with care.
First, the preface reveals their function; next, the essentials correspond to the body. When the body encompasses function, both nature and life are complete.

### **The Supreme Nine Essentials of the Heart-Seal Wondrous Scripture**

#### **1. The True One – Secret Essentials**
The "True One" is pure and without admixture—this is called *true*; enduring through kalpas without end—this is called *one*.

The Supreme Lord said:
- Heaven attains the One, and the sun, moon, and stars remain eternally clear.
- Earth attains the One, and pearls, jade, and treasures remain eternally tranquil.
- Humans attain the One, and spirit, qi, and essence endure forever.

The One is the root; the root is the body of the Dao. The Dao fundamentally has no body, yet we forcibly name it *body*. A body that is tangible is not the true body; the body that is formless never diminishes in daily use.

The true body is the True One. *True* is the spirit of humans; *one* is the qi of humans. When spirit embraces qi and qi embraces spirit, they coalesce within the Sea of Qi, giving rise to the divine tortoise—this is the life of humans.

Spirit is the nature of humans. Nature is the red serpent of the south; life is the black tortoise of the north. When tortoise and serpent entwine, the two qi devour each other, penetrating as a single qi that flows above and below, reaching everywhere without obstruction—this is the Dao of embracing the origin and guarding the One.

#### **2. The Bellows and Key – Secret Essentials**
The "bellows and key" are the human heart and kidneys. The heart is the abode of spirit; the kidneys are the repository of qi. If the heart is the abode and the kidneys the repository, how can transformation occur?

In this age, those who study the Dao force the heart to move qi, creating endless chaos, exhausting the body and wearing out the form—this is not the natural Dao.

The Sage said: All that has form is illusory and false; the formless form is called the true form. The true form is spirit and qi. Spirit is the master of the heart; qi is the root of the kidneys. Thus, the Sage returns to the origin and restores the primordial.

Restoring the primordial is replenishing the marrow. The mechanism of replenishing marrow is the Dao of returning to the origin—life is then complete.

The Sage established the method: temporarily employ one spirit to harmonize qi, and rely on one qi to stabilize spirit. When spirit and qi are harmonized and stabilized, one then understands movement and stillness.

Movement is qi; qi is life. Stillness is nature; nature is spirit. Spirit does not depart from qi, and qi does not depart from spirit. When spirit and qi do not separate, the Dao is fundamentally natural.

#### **3. The Three-Five – Pivotal Essentials**
The "Three-Five One" refers to the three yangs, the five phases, and the one qi.

The three yangs are the three fires: essence as the people’s fire, qi as the minister’s fire, and the heart as the sovereign’s fire. The sovereign’s fire is the fire of nature; this fire must not be aroused or employed.

If the fire of nature is aroused, it is like fire born from wood—once disaster erupts, it must consume. If it is not employed, it must not be stirred. For when spirit is settled, qi is settled; when qi is settled, essence is settled.

Once the three fires are settled, they converge in the Cinnabar Field, gathering to refine the Golden Crucible. The five phases are reverted and refined, circulating within the one qi. Continuously, day and night, for 13,500 breaths, aligning with the 384 lines of the Zhou Heaven, qi and blood traverse 810 zhang, and the pulse completes fifty cycles—this is the Zhou Heaven, and only then is the firing process complete.

This fire has two types, divided into internal and external. The external fire has form and image; it can refine the five metals, transform the five grains, and nourish humans. This fire cannot refine the elixir. The fire that refines the elixir is the internal fire.

The internal fire has a name but no form. It relies on the qi of the five grains to generate true fire. Once true fire is born, it reverts to refine essence. Essence reverts to become spirit; refining spirit merges with the Dao. The Dao is fundamentally natural, not departing from the one qi. When the one qi is harmonized, all things follow.

#### **4. The Three-One Mechanism – Essentials**
The "Three-One" means the three complete the one qi.

Above, there are immortals embracing the One, refining spirit as the singular Dao.
In the middle, there is enriching the nation and pacifying the people, refining qi as the method.
Below, there is strengthening the army and achieving victory, refining essence as the technique.

The Dao divides into three completions, yet does not depart from the one qi.

The one qi is Heaven—it is the clear, empty, and natural qi of Heaven. Within qi resides spirit; spirit embraces qi. Because qi embraces the one spirit, refining spirit merges with the Dao. The Dao is fundamentally natural—this is immortals embracing the One and refining spirit to merge with the Dao.

In the middle, refining qi as the method for enriching the nation and pacifying the people: the middle is the human. The body is the nation; qi is the people; the heart is the emperor. When the emperor loves the people, the people are naturally at peace.

When the emperor is upright, the heart is not disordered. When the heart is not disordered, qi naturally harmonizes. When qi harmonizes, spirit is at ease; when spirit is at ease, essence is joyful; when essence is joyful, the body is peaceful and prosperous—this is the method for enriching the nation and pacifying the people by refining qi.

Taking the heavy and turbid as Earth, within the turbid there is clarity. To be in desire yet without desire is called "strengthening the army." When the heart does not move and qi does not mingle, this is called "achieving victory." This is the technique for strengthening the army and achieving victory by refining essence.

Before humans were born, they existed within the primordial chaos. Even then, spirit had not departed from qi, and qi had not departed from spirit. When spirit and qi do not separate, spirit and essence are internally guarded. Essence scatters to become qi; qi congeals to become spirit. Refining spirit merges with the Dao—the Dao follows nature.

Establishing methods upon the Dao, methods manifest as techniques—divided into three, merged into one. The first is essence, essence being the mother of primordial qi and the root of humanity. Within the body, it becomes qi; within the bones, it becomes marrow; within the mind, it becomes spirit—all transformations of essence. All things are endowed with a single qi, and through qi, the Five Phases are created. The Five Phases are the Five Grains, and the qi of the Five Grains enters the viscera, while essence resides in the Cinnabar Field—essence is the root of humanity. Thus, the sage returns to the root and restores the primordial—this is the Dao of returning to the root and restoring the primordial.

**The Essence of Solar Yang and Lunar Yin**
Solar yang and lunar yin are yin and yang, and yin and yang are the sun and moon. The sun pertains to yang, its yang-soul; the moon pertains to yin, its yin-spirit. Within the sun is the crow, symbolizing the west’s Metal and the lungs—yin in nature. Thus, the sun’s yang-soul conceals the moon’s yin-spirit, and when the spirit is full within the soul, the sun is clear. Within the moon is the hare, symbolizing the east’s Wood and the liver—yang in nature. Thus, the moon’s yin-spirit conceals the sun’s yang-soul, and when the soul is full within the spirit, the moon is bright. Soul and spirit are humanity’s lead and mercury. Lead and mercury have their measures: eight ounces of lead, eight ounces of mercury—sixteen ounces in total. Each ounce comprises twenty-four *zhu*, corresponding to the 384 lines of the Zhouyi, the revolutions of the sun and moon, and the mechanism of heaven and earth’s creation. The sages established these measures, and later generations followed them. The methods vary in scale—great methods span a year, while lesser ones serve an hour. When an hour is regulated, it can seize a year’s creative power.

**Secret Instructions:**
On the first day of each month, at the *zi* hour, under the *Kan* trigram, add one ounce of mercury; under the *Li* trigram, add fifteen ounces of lead. On the second day, under *Kan*, add two ounces of mercury; under *Li*, add fourteen ounces of lead. By the fifteenth day, the additions and subtractions are complete. This cycle repeats, with careful attention to the lengths of months. Lead and mercury are humanity’s soul and spirit, and soul and spirit are humanity’s spirit and qi. Spirit favors stillness, qi favors movement—movement and stillness constantly reside between *Kan* and *Li*. The method of movement and stillness: for the first fifteen days, the soul guards the spirit; for the latter fifteen, the spirit guards the soul. An hour’s practice can seize a year’s creative power.

**The Essentials of Daily Practice in the Five Phases**
In daily practice, spirit guards qi, and qi guards spirit—when spirit and qi guard each other, gathering without scattering, this is true daily practice. Spirit can respond universally; where intention goes, the heart achieves. If spirit is settled, then in movement, stillness, sitting, and lying, day and night, all are observed. When spirit subdues qi and qi resides in spirit, and spirit resides in form—when these three are present, they return to the true One, and all affairs are complete.

The Five Phases: the heart governs spirit, the liver governs the ethereal soul, the spleen governs intention, the kidneys govern will, and the lungs govern the corporeal soul. When the Five Phases gather, they transform into the elixir. The method of gathering: focus on one spirit, direct intention to one purpose, guard the ethereal and corporeal souls, and unite them in the Cinnabar Field. The ethereal and corporeal souls are humanity’s spirit and qi. Qi is life, and spirit is nature—when nature stabilizes life, and life stabilizes nature, nature and life stabilize each other, together forming a single qi. This qi is fire, formless yet flaming when activated. This fire is only for refining the elixir and serves no other purpose. If one can internally guard the true fire, gathering it without scattering, this is the true Dao of embracing the primordial and guarding the One.

**The Sevenfold Return of the Reverted Elixir**
The sevenfold reverted elixir: heaven has seven stars that govern the four seasons; humans have seven orifices, primarily for hearing and seeing. The eyes observe forms yet see nothing; the ears listen to sounds yet hear nothing; the nose does not smell fragrance, and the mouth receives no taste—this is the true sevenfold return. Unifying the heart to return to life is called "reversion"; when the Five Qi do not scatter, it is called "elixir." There are two kinds of elixirs: the inner and outer elixirs. The inner elixir transcends spirit to connect with qi, while the outer elixir transcends the world to connect with qi. For the world-transcending elixir, the firing times must be precise. The inner elixir cannot be completed without the outer elixir, nor can the outer elixir have a foundation without the inner elixir. The inner elixir is the qi of the true One; the outer elixir is the qi of the Five Grains. With qi connecting qi and essence replenishing marrow, the work of replenishment and connection does not depart from the two qi of yin and yang. When yang qi ascends, it is called "return"; when qi descends, it is called "reversion." Day and night, reversion and return reach the Cinnabar Field. Without yin, yang does not ascend; without yang, yin does not descend. The essential secret of natural elixir reversion lies herein!

**The Eight Trigrams’ Return to the Origin**
The Eight Trigrams: the heart and kidneys correspond to *Kan* and *Li*, and *Kan* and *Li* are yin and yang. Yang is the ethereal soul, and yin is the corporeal spirit. The ethereal soul corresponds to the east’s *jia-yi* Wood, called the Azure Dragon; the corporeal spirit corresponds to the west’s *geng-xin* Metal, called the White Tiger. From *Kan* and *Li* arise the Dragon and Tiger, forming the Four Images, which further divide into the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams: *jia* Wood corresponds to *Qian*, *yi* to *Kun*; Wood generates *bing*, *bing* corresponds to *Gen*, *ding* to *Dui*. *Gen* and *Dui* combine in sequence to form the *Tai Shang Jiu Yao Xin Yin Miao Jing Qi*—*bing* of the east is yang, and yin is fire. Fire generates *wu-ji*, which is formless and distributed across the four seasons, internally generating *geng-xin*. *Geng* corresponds to *Zhen*, *xin* to *Xun*, and together they form Metal. Metal generates *ren-gui*: *ren* corresponds to *Li*, *gui* to *Kan*. *Kan* and *Li* are yin and yang. Yin and yang are internal and external—internal qi is yang, external qi is yin. The ascent and descent of yin and yang, movement and stillness, are natural, not the work of spirit, but the harmonious qi of heaven and earth, perpetually residing between *Kan* and *Li*, ceaseless day and night, endless with each breath. This is the Dao of the Eight Trigrams’ return to the origin and restoration of the root.

The Nine Returns—A Summary of Qi’s Essentials

Now, the *nine* is yang; *return* is gathering; *one* is qi. When the nine yangs gather, nature and life guard each other. Above, they form the clarity and emptiness of the sun and moon’s celestial movements; below, they are the earth’s qi, the source of all creation; in the center, they are the human body, the principle of yin-yang transformation. Each contains three, thus called the Dao of the Three Unities—this is named the *Nine Essentials*.

Each containing three: Heaven has three—the sun, moon, and stars—corresponding to the human eyes, ears, and nose. Earth has three—high, low, and level—corresponding to the human *hun*, *po*, and essence. *Hun*, *po*, and essence correspond to the human essence, qi, and spirit. The spirit governs essence, and essence is the root of spirit. Though named as three, they do not depart from the one qi.

The one qi is *taixi* (embryonic breathing). The embryo is the dwelling of spirit; breathing is the transformation of the embryo. The primordial arises from breath, and breath is governed by spirit within the embryo. Without breath, the embryo cannot form; without spirit, breath has no master. Breath is the root of the embryo, the embryo the dwelling of breath, and spirit the true essence of the embryo.

Within the abdomen, it is called the embryo; each inhalation and exhalation is called breath—thus the name *taixi*. The embryo is the child of qi within form; breath is the mother of spirit within form. Why not preserve and guard the child and mother within form? To preserve and guard is to preserve the spirit and guard the qi.

This qi resides between *Kan* and *Li*, round like a pestle and mortar, resembling a crouching tortoise—hence called the *spirit tortoise*. The tortoise contains black water, and within the water is qi, named *spirit qi* or the *blue-eyed foreign monk*, also called the *Perfected One*—the root and stem of humanity, all residing here.

Within the twelve hours, the Celestial Gate borrows qi; the Earth Pass is tightly sealed; the Spirit Chamber is internally guarded. Naturally, the spirit tortoise breathes—existing in name but not form, moving yet nameless. It does not employ ascent and descent; rather, it naturally borrows external qi to ascend. As external qi ascends, the abdomen naturally swells; as external qi ascends, internal qi descends. As internal qi descends, the abdomen naturally contracts. The mechanism of swelling and contraction is the key to heaven and earth.

This key is the qi of heaven and earth’s movement—true yin and true yang. Internal qi is yang; external qi is yin. Internal qi does not exit; external qi does not enter. Spirit aligns with qi, and qi stabilizes. When external qi aligns, it becomes the supreme treasure; when internal qi aligns, it forms the *Golden Elixir*.

The *Golden Elixir* is a purely yang substance, the vast and true, directly pointing to the celestial mechanism—the Dao of returning to the root is complete. Should you encounter a Perfected One, swear an oath to heaven, first receive the *Yang Jue* (Upward Mudra), then transmit the *Heart Seal*. Beware—do not lightly divulge this celestial treasure!

Take heed! Take heed!

Thus concludes the *Tai Shang Jiu Yao Xin Yin Miao Jing*.
