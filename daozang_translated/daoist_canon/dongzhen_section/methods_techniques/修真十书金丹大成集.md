### *Exposition on the Primordial Ultimate Diagram*
That which is called the Dao/Way. What is above form is termed the Dao—this is the essence of the Dao. From the Primordial Ultimate (元极) emerges the Supreme Ultimate (太极). Setting aside the three within the ninefold wood number, it encompasses fifty-five numbers. The central ○ is its fundamental essence.

When the Supreme Ultimate divides, the Two Modes (两仪) are born. Movement arises from yin; stillness is rooted in yang. Through the transformation of yang and the union of yin, water, fire, earth, metal, and wood are generated.

Water: generative number one, completion number six.
Fire: generative number two, completion number seven.
Wood: generative number three, completion number eight.
Metal: generative number four, completion number nine.
Earth: generative number five, completion number ten.
These are the generative and completion numbers of the Five Phases.

Heaven-one, Earth-two; Heaven-three, Earth-four; Heaven-five, Earth-six; Heaven-seven, Earth-eight; Heaven-nine, Earth-ten. The numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five. These are the odd (yang) and even (yin) numbers.

That which is called the Dao is the interplay of one yin and one yang; the ceaseless generation of life is called the *Yi* (易). One is the odd number; two is the even number. Yang as odd and yin as even—from two arises three.

Pure *Qian* (乾) is nature; the union of two *Qian* forms *Kun* (坤), which is destiny. This is akin to essence and qi. *Qian* repeatedly seeks *Kun* to form *Kan* (坎), wherein the yang within *Kan* is primordial qi—this is what is meant by "the Dao of *Qian* gives rise to the male." *Kun* repeatedly seeks *Qian* to form *Li* (离), wherein the yin within *Li* is true essence—this is what is meant by "the Dao of *Kun* gives rise to the female." *Qian* as male and *Kun* as female refer to transformation through qi.

*Li* symbolizes the sun; *Kan* symbolizes the moon. The union of sun and moon forms the *Wu* (吴). The *Yi* is the Dao of daily practice and simplicity, ever-changing yet never perishing.

Thus, the essence within form remains quiescent and unmoving, for what is firm, strong, centered, upright, pure, and refined abides—this is where nature resides and the root of destiny lies. The spirit within the heart responds and connects, for joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure, love, aversion, and desire abide—this is where destiny resides and the pivot of nature lies.

Restraining anger causes the heart-fire to descend; suppressing desire causes the kidney-water to ascend. The noble person, centered in the yellow and penetrating principle, occupies the correct position within the body. Virtue/power resides within, flowing through the four limbs—thus cultivation brings auspiciousness.

Thereafter, guarding against deviance and preserving sincerity, one remains foolish all day. When the heavenly principle is wholly preserved, returning to the root is called tranquility; tranquility is called restoration. Movement reaches its extreme and reverts to stillness; stillness reaches its extreme and reverts to movement.

The myriad things transform—this refers to transformation through form. What is below form is termed "instrument"—this is the function of the Dao.

Master Nanxuan said: Truly recognizing the root is called "knowing the Dao." One who knows this Dao may transcend the bounds of creation and stand alone, towering and self-sustaining.

### *Diagram of the Celestial Heart*
The hook lies horizontal like a crescent moon; three points form the platform of stars. The Dipper’s handle revolves; the tiger roars and the dragon intones.

### *Diagram of the Mysterious Female*
The valley of emptiness and primal origin, the root of Heaven and Earth. Mysterious and yet more mysterious—this is the gate of all wonders.

### *Diagram of the Accomplished Cauldron*
Lead-water arises from *Li*; mercury-fire roots in *Kan*. They enter the cauldron of mutual support, achieving interpenetration.

### *Diagram of the River Chariot*
The true north is perfectly black; sun and moon serve as its wheels. It transports water and circulates fire, ceaseless day and night.

### *Diagram of the Circumambulation of Heaven’s Fire Timing*
*Diagram of the Fire Timing Talisman for Discharging Heaven’s Fire*

**The Eleven Months and the Return of the *Fu* Hexagram**
The eleventh month corresponds to the *Fu* hexagram, called the "First Return." A faint, gentle fire is suitable for nurturing; the initial yang (nine at the bottom) is a "hidden dragon" that must not be forced.

**The Twelfth Month and the *Lin* Hexagram**
The twelfth month corresponds to the *Lin* hexagram, called the "Second Return." One must await the time when the second yang (nine in the second place) appears as a dragon—only then do yin and yang begin to cherish one another.

**The First Month and the *Tai* Hexagram**
The first month corresponds to the *Tai* hexagram, called the "Third Return and First Reversal." In the *yin* month, the *zhun* line straightens the matter; only then may one begin to advance the fire and refine the red lead.

**The Second Month and the *Zhuang* Hexagram**
Wood-fluid flourishes in the *mao* month; the cinnabar elixir should be bathed.

**The Third Month and the *Da Zhuang* Hexagram**
The third month corresponds to the *Da Zhuang* hexagram, called the "Fourth Return and Second Reversal." Within this reversal, one must discern the subtleties of the work—after the civil fire, one should add a martial fire.

**The Fourth Month and the *Qian* Hexagram**
The fourth month corresponds to the *Qian* hexagram, called the "Fifth Return and Third Reversal." In this month, one must again apply the martial fire, drawing forth the White Tiger to produce the luminous pearl.

**The Fifth Month and the *Gou* Hexagram**
The fifth month corresponds to the *Gou* hexagram, called the "Sixth Return and Fourth Reversal." After bathing, retreat the talisman; the processes of withdrawal and addition remain perilous.

**The Sixth Month and the *Qian* Hexagram**
The sixth month corresponds to the *Qian* hexagram, called the "Seventh Return and Fifth Reversal." As the martial fire nears its end, employ a civil fire; the peach blossoms have fallen, leaving only the stem.

**The Seventh Month and the *Pi* Hexagram**
The seventh month corresponds to the *Pi* hexagram, called the "Eighth Return and Sixth Reversal." Civil fire at both ends, martial fire in the middle.

**The Eighth Month and the *Guan* Hexagram**
Metal-essence flourishes in the *you* month; after bathing, nurture the fire.

**The Ninth Month and the *Bo* Hexagram**
The ninth month corresponds to the *Bo* hexagram, called the "Ninth Return and Seventh Reversal." Receiving the generative and transformative powers, the fire’s abode lies in the *xu* month.

**The Tenth Month and the *Kun* Hexagram**
The embryo is swallowed into the abdomen; "my fate is not left to Heaven." The work enters the *Kun* palace, and the Way of the Returned Elixir is complete.

### *Diagram of the Sixty Hexagrams’ Great Timing*
Some ask: "There are sixty-four hexagrams; why are only sixty used?"
*Qian* and *Kun* serve as the gate and vessel;
*Kan* and *Li* form the framework and pivot.
They embody Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, encompassing the myriad things—unused yet employed to achieve penetration.

The sixty hexagrams comprise three hundred sixty lines, and together with the four hexagrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*, total three hundred eighty-four lines, amounting to eleven thousand five hundred twenty counting rods, corresponding to the number of the myriad things.
Morning and evening each employ one hexagram, totaling twelve lines, with each line representing one hour.
In its smallness, it mirrors the three hundred sixty hours of a month;
in its grandeur, it mirrors the three hundred sixty days of a year;
in its movement, it mirrors the degrees of the celestial revolution.
When one grasps the image and forgets the words, the meaning becomes clear.

### *Diagram of the Great Expansion Number*
Two from the south of Winter Mountain, five from the north, and four from the west combine.
*Wu* and *Ji* return to their original generative numbers; the three families meet to form the infant.

Heaven and Earth possess no useless numbers. Thus, one, three, five, seven, nine are the odd yang numbers, totaling twenty-five as Heaven’s number. Two, four, six, eight, ten are the even yin numbers, totaling thirty as Earth’s number. The numbers of Heaven and Earth together total fifty-five. The number of the Great Expansion is fifty, subtracting five as the root of the Five Phases. Its use is forty-nine, further subtracting one to symbolize the unmoving Great Ultimate. From this, one may understand its substance and function.

The *Zhongli Transmission of the Dao* states: "Advancing the fire has its numbers."

### *Diagram of the Golden Elixir’s Key*
**Song of the Discarded Key**
The key of *Qian* and *Kun* is struck by number;
the *Li* and *Kan* spoon is probed by timing.
Lead-dragon ascends as mercury-tiger descends;
tortoise and snake hold fast above and below.
The sun above turns beneath the earth;
the moon beneath the sea flies above the heavens.
*Qian* and *Kun*, sun and moon, do not move of themselves—
all is due to the Dipper’s handle turning the mechanism.
If the human heart aligns with the Heavenly Heart,
yin and yang are inverted in but a moment.
When tiger and dragon have battled and the Three Fields are still,
gather the mysterious pearl and plant it in the mud.
The Yellow Dame mediates, entering the Central Palace;
infant and maiden pursue one another.
Using years for months, days for hours,
the work within the moment grows ever more wondrous.
Secretly trysting with the Dipper and Ox, they rejoice—
the Heavenly mechanism is profound, few know it.
Advancing the fire refines the marrow of Heaven and Earth;
opening the furnace and bathing, rosy clouds advance in splendor.
Nine Returns and Seven Reversals occur in an instant;
true blackness steams and reaches the four limbs.
Nurturing the infant relies solely on the mother;
guarding the city and waging wild war require vigilance.
One hour and eight quarters make a celestial cycle;
twelve hours correspond to one year.
Beginning with the *Fu* hexagram and ending with *Bo*,
morning *Zhun* and evening *Meng* follow in order.
Spring, summer, autumn, winter proceed in sequence;
refining concludes in the *Kun* palace, where it solidifies.
No need to exhaust the *Yi* or practice hexagram qi—
within the body, there is naturally a *Kun* and *Qian*.
When Heaven and Earth, sun and moon conjoin,
shatter the void with but a single fist.
The cosmos and its transformations lie in my hands—
the supreme Heavenly mechanism is not rashly transmitted.
Only humans, most noble and precious,
can refine the Golden Fluid and the Great Returned Elixir.

**White Instructions on the Returned Elixir**
The Golden Fluid returns and reverses, coalescing into the Great Elixir.
The Dao is near at hand; learning immortality is not difficult.
Gather the great medicine from the jade flask,
refine the Golden Fluid’s returned elixir,
plumb the mysterious pearl from the Red Waters.
Tortoise and snake swallow and regurgitate, circulating the supreme treasure of the west;
dragon and tiger coil and revolve, emerging from the Purple Palace as sea maidens and clouds arise,
the Yellow River churns and the Mud Pill’s waves surge.
Though *Qian* and *Kun* share a body, *Dui* is called the vessel—
yet lead and mercury, the two substances, are mutually rooted.
Where lies the source of the elixir?
Preserve the Three Essentials to guard the One Origin.
The Golden Fluid coalesces,
naturally completing the Nine Returns and circling the Seven Reversals.
This elixir—
elusive and formless, yet darkly numinous and precise—
follows the eight hexagrams and unites the four images;
gathers the Three Flowers and penetrates the Five Phases.
Its flavor emerges from *geng* and *xin*;
one must steady the will to gather it.
Its hexagrams belong to *Gen* and *Xun*;
one must know the time of its flourishing.
At first, refine the Golden Fluid to achieve union;
in the end, harmonize the jade nectar to nurture completion.
The circulation of sun and moon within the flask
must clarify the ancestral body within;
the union of husband and wife
must recognize the root and stem.
In ascent and descent, distinguish ruler and minister;
in coming and going, still discern host and guest.

Silencing the echoes of the ears, harmonizing the breath of the nose,
discern the tender or mature state of the medicine.
Grasp the precise measures of advance and retreat,
embrace the One with single-minded devotion, guarding the white *qi* of the feminine and masculine.
At dawn, let the flying mercury seize the hun-soul;
at dusk, draw the lead to restrain the po-soul.
Push and pull the talismanic fire,
rolling and unfurling the yin and yang within the nature;
inhale and exhale the winds and clouds,
refining and smelting the *qi*-fluid within the body.
Generally, when one refines the *qi*,
one must harmonize it with the Four Images;
when the *qi* is purely yang,
it naturally dissolves the host of yin.
Seize the Green Dragon in the east,
capture the White Tiger in the west,
seek the Dark Warrior in the north,
and the Red Bird in the south.
Only in the Central Palace do they harmonize and dwell together.
Seal them deep within the earthen crucible.
There is movement and stillness,
there is *qi* but no form;
know fortune and misfortune,
discern the moment from the heart.
One can brew the wine of spontaneity,
slowly tune the zither without melody.
Once arranged within the cauldron,
boil it into white snow;
stir the discarded key of heaven and earth,
forge it into true gold.
At first, metal and wood are separated—
who enables their union?
Metal and water blend,
yet remain unrefined.
Only when the Golden Well is drawn once,
the Water Tiger lies hidden;
when the Golden Lock is sprung,
the Fire Dragon meets.
Thus, fill the golden crucible to regulate the flavor and seal it firmly;
ingest the purple-golden paste to congeal the spirit and close the senses.
Circulate the true *qi* to fill the body,
entering and exiting the vastness of the primordial spirit.
Fire ascends, water descends—
skillfully manage the *Zhun* and *Meng* hexagrams;
the spokes of the wheel turn in concert—
silently align with the *Pi* and *Tai* hexagrams.
One must also know the harmony of medicines.
For the enlightened, it is easy;
yet the firing times, the subtle ebb and flow, are difficult to master.
Ten months of effort abide in the faint, continuous breath;
thirty thousand years of *qi*-destiny lie in the ceaseless coming and going.
Thus, nurture the treasure of the two elixir fields—
this treasure endures forever.
Seize the pearl from the elixir crucible—
this pearl returns again.
Having attained this method of transcendence,
constantly open the gate of life and death.
Drive the River Chariot,
departing the sea of the mundane world’s tail-end;
return to the Heavenly Valley,
ascending the Kunlun and Penglai mountains.
Alas! Though myriad immortal methods are expounded in essays, songs, and poems,
the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass governs spirit, *qi*, and vitality.
Ascend the Golden Gate,
pay homage at the Golden Palace,
receiving the Emperor’s decree;
adorn the golden form,
attain the golden immortal,
shedding the knot of the sacred embryo.
This is the ingestion of the golden-fluid elixir,
forming the vajra-body,
where nature and life are both perfected—
a mystery not lightly revealed.

---

**Poem on the Golden-Fluid Return Elixir**

Convey the fluid to Kunlun’s peak—
the effort is truly not arduous.
Coming and going, knock at the jade grotto,
returning to refine the golden elixir.
In the west, gather the three medicines;
in the center, guard the single altar.
Seize the moment to act—
after the Seven Returns, it coalesces into a mass.
Stir the plain of heaven and earth,
circulate along the shoals of sun and moon.
The Mysterious Pass is but one aperture,
a straight path piercing the heavens’ summit.

---

**Treatise on the Golden-Fluid Return Elixir**

The Dao employs the heart.
Some may doubt this—
the perfected ones clarify it.
The Dao is the essence of the heart;
the heart is the function of the Dao.
The Dao fuses with the heart,
the heart unites with the Dao—
beyond the Dao, there is no remaining heart;
beyond the heart, there is no remaining Dao.
Those who know how to apply this:
observe the heart through the Dao, and the heart is the Dao;
permeate the Dao with the heart, and the Dao is the heart.
This heart is not the human heart—
it is the heart of Heaven.
Heaven resides at the North Star,
the pivot of creation—
this is the heart.
Thus, when the Dipper’s handle turns once,
the four seasons respond in rhythm,
the Five Phases follow in order,
cold and heat strike the mean,
yin and yang attain harmony.
It is the same in humans.
The head has five palaces,
corresponding to the nine directions—
among them, one palace is called the Heavenly Heart.
It is also named the Purple Palace, Heavenly Abyss, Heavenly Wheel,
Heavenly Pass, Heavenly Capital Mountain, Capital Pass, Kunlun Peak—
its names are many.
In sum, it is called the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass.
Those who apply it here need not distinguish the rivers and springs
where medicinal ingredients are produced,
nor the subtleties of firing times,
nor even the warming and nurturing to form the elixir—
all do not depart from the function of this heart.
It is often said: the more the medicine is gathered, the more it multiplies;
the more the fire refines, the more it coalesces.
At the outset of gathering the medicine,
stir the sacred key of heaven and earth,
take the *daogui* from *Li* and *Kan*,
congeal the spirit and gather the *qi*,
harmonize the breath of the nose,
so that inhalation and exhalation respond to the hand.
When the spirit and *qi* enter their root,
closing too tightly leads to urgency,
loosening too freely leads to dissipation—
only let it be faint and continuous,
without interruption.
Then, the spirit naturally congeals over time,
the breath naturally settles over time.
In the work of firing,
there is hardness and softness,
civil and martial,
advancing an inch and retreating a foot,
short in front and long behind,
distinguishing guest and host, establishing ruler and minister,
so that the yin talismans and yang fire advance and retreat appropriately.
If the fire’s measure is too parched, the mercury will fly upward;
if the water’s weight is too excessive, the lead will dissolve downward—
only by balancing the weight and measure,
adhering to the proper method,
can one avoid the error of advancing fire and retreating talismans.
Thus, follow the hexagrams’ lines,
compressing twelve months into a single hour,
with yin and yang ascending and descending—
this is the rule for applying the fire.
When the first yang arises, it begins with *Fu*,
the time is *zi*—
gently nurture the hidden dragon.
*Lin* is *chou*—
warmly nurture the emerging dragon.
*Tai* is *yin*—
fire is born in *yin*,
the direct task of *Zhun*,
so advance the talisman with martial fire.
*Zhuang* is *mao*—
yang contains yin within,
so bathe.
*Guai* is *chen*—
refine with civil fire.
*Qian* ends at *si*—
add martial fire.
From *zi* to *si*, pure yang governs—
this is seeking outer yang from inner yin.
When the first yin arises, it begins with *Gou*,
the time is *wu*—
fire flourishes at *wu*,
so retreat the talisman with civil fire.

Slow is *wei*—the time is the sixth month,
so apply martial fire,
lest it become the thick frost of midsummer.
*Pi* is *shen*—
gently regulate with mild fire.
*Guan* is *you*—
yin contains yang within,
so bathe, then nurture the fire.
*Bo* is *xu*—
fire is stored in *xu*,
receiving the gift of generation and completion,
so use martial fire.
*Kun* ends at *hai*—
shedding the embryo to enter the womb,
transforming to achieve change.
From *wu* to *hai*, pure yin governs—
this is outer yang attaching to inner yin.
Yet fire is born in *yin*, flourishes at *wu*, and is stored in *xu*,
so the subtlety of withdrawal and addition lies in *Zhun* and *Meng*.

Alas! From *Fu* at the beginning to *Kun* at the end,
all follow the hexagrams’ images.
Advance and retreat mirror the succession of spring, summer, autumn, and winter;
withdrawal and addition mirror the waxing and waning of sun and moon.
Before fire ignites, borrow the *Xun* wind to fan it;
once fire burns, rely on *Kun* water to nourish it.
When the fire’s work ceases,
qi and liquid merge,
lead and mercury intertwine,
the Crone gathers her sleeves,
the Infant looks up in obedience—
abiding in the central palace,
they unite as one.
The secret of the seven returns and nine refinements ends here.

Had the firing been misapplied,
a hundred strange signs would arise:
the Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon would take flight,
the Kan Man and Li Woman would flee in haste.
Even if the Yellow Emperor tended the furnace,
the Great One wielded the fire,
and the Eight Lords refined it,
they could not form the elixir.

Can one not be cautious and harmonize it?
Thus the *Elixir Canon* says:
"Even with true lead, true fire is still difficult."
How could this be lightly discussed?

Yet the Dao of the Golden Elixir is all based on images—
using lead and mercury as its body,
one must know that lead essence and mercury marrow are but metaphors.
Using *Li* and *Kan* as names,
one must know that the Kan Man and Li Woman are mere empty terms.
Using dragon and tiger as forms,
one must know that Fire Dragon and Water Tiger are not tangible shapes.
What of Yellow Sprouts and White Snow,
Divine Water and Flowery Pond—
are these things visible or usable?

In essence, they are matched and harmonized,
withdrawn and added, then put to use.
Thus this elixir is not made from metals, stones, herbs, or wood,
nor is this firing governed by years, months, days, or hours.
One must proceed from the root and the real ground.

Refining form to transform into blackness,
refining blackness to transform into spirit—
this is nothing more than seizing Heaven and Earth’s single point of true yang.
It begins with effort but ends in effortlessness.

Some cling to images to arrange the furnace,
attach to forms to craft the crucible,
fixate on firing times,
and mistake it all for empty nothingness—
this is error.

Ah! When *Pi* reaches its limit, *Tai* arises;
when movement reaches its limit, stillness comes.
In stillness, life is commanded.
True essence returns at dawn,
true breath settles on its own,
the Valley Spirit dwells,
the Three Corpses perish.
The heart holds no heart,
thoughts hold no thoughts,
the body enters formlessness,
and merges with the Dao.

Purple Void Perfected Master Xiao Tingzhi Yuanrui’s *Questions and Answers on the Golden Elixir*

**Question:** What is meant by "golden liquid returning elixir"?
**Answer:** The "golden liquid" is golden water. Gold is the mother of water, and the mother conceals the child in her womb—hence the name "returning elixir." As the earlier worthies said: "The elixir is the cinnabar field; the liquid is the fluid of the lungs. Returning the lung’s fluid to the cinnabar field is called the golden liquid returning elixir."

**Question:** What are lead and mercury?
**Answer:** They are not ordinary black tin or quicksilver. True Unity Master said: "Lead is the father and mother of heaven and earth, the root of yin and yang." The sages gather the root of heaven and earth’s parents as the foundation of the great elixir, and collect the pure essence of yin and yang as its substance—this is no common fabrication. Mercury’s nature loves to fly, but when it meets lead, it congeals, for child and mother yearn for each other.

**Question:** What is fire?
**Answer:** Fire is the true qi of the great yang, the yang within *Kan*. Purple Clarity Perfected said: "Raising fire from within *Kan*."

**Question:** What is a *hou* (phase)?
**Answer:** Five days make one *hou*, completing one cycle of the *jiazi*. Each day has twelve hours, and five days—sixty hours—complete one *jiazi*. Purple Yang said: "A moment’s effort contains a year’s seasonal phases." When raising the fire, in an instant it circulates the celestial orbit.

**Question:** How is the fire phase applied?
**Answer:** In a year, use the months; in a month, use the days; in a day, use the hours; in an hour, use the *ke* (quarters).

**Question:** What is the true unity?
**Answer:** When one stabilizes one’s own celestial authenticity within the celestial valley, this is the Way of guarding the true unity. The Master of the Golden Grotto said: "The true unity resides within the northern pole’s great abyss."

**Question:** What are movement and stillness?
**Answer:** Yang governs movement; yin governs stillness. Emerald Void said: "Seek stillness within movement; within stillness, there is action. Movement and stillness have their works—this is transmitted orally."

**Question:** What is the ninefold return?
**Answer:** Metal generates four, and its completion number is nine. "Return" means descending from above. Nine is the number of old yang. Yin Perfected Lord said: "From *zi* to *shen* is the ninefold return, descending in sequence."

**Question:** What is the sevenfold reversal?
**Answer:** Fire generates two, and its completion number is seven. "Reversal" means ascending from below. Seven is the number of young yang. Yin Perfected Lord said: "From *yin* to *shen* is seven, reversing upward."

**Question:** What is the furnace?
**Answer:** In the superior elixir method, the spirit is the furnace, nature is the medicine, stillness is water, and wisdom is fire. In the middle elixir method, the spirit is the furnace, qi is the medicine, the sun is fire, and the moon is water. In the inferior elixir method, the body is the furnace, qi is the medicine, the heart is fire, and the kidneys are water. There are also the recumbent moon furnace and the jade furnace.

**Question:** What is the crucible?
**Answer:** As Bao Perfected said: "The golden crucible lies near the muddy pellet." This is the Yellow Emperor’s casting of the nine crucibles.

**Question:** What are the medicine and ingredients?
**Answer:** These very medicines, when followed in sequence, form a person; when reversed, they form the elixir. The five phases inverted yield the seven treasures of the great earth; the five phases in sequence lead to the fiery pit of the dharma realm. The common people use them daily yet remain unaware. Purple Clarity said: "Gather the medicines within the unchanging."

**Question:** What are the divine water and flowery pond?
**Answer:** Li Quan said: "The essence of the returning elixir lies in the divine water and flowery pond." Purple Yang said: "When lead enters mercury, it is called divine water; when mercury enters lead, it is called the flowery pond." Sea Toad said: "From of old, divine water flows from the lofty source." Purple Clarity said: "The flowery pond resides within the sea of qi."

**Question:** What are the three passes?
**Answer:** The head is the celestial pass, the feet are the earthly pass, and the hands are the human pass.

**Question:** What are the inner three essentials?
**Answer:** The first essential is the great abyssal pool. The second is the crimson palace. The third is the earthly gate.

**Question:** What are the outer three essentials?
**Answer:** The mouth and nose together form three orifices—the gateways through which spirit and qi come and go. When practicing, regulate the breath through the nose, restrain the tongue’s qi, and close the *dui*.

**Question:** What is *dui*?
**Answer:** True Unity Master said: "*Dui* is the mouth."

**Question:** Where do the infant boy and the old woman reside?
**Answer:** The infant boy is in the kidneys; the old woman is in the heart.

**Question:** The kidneys belong to water and are yin; the infant boy belongs to yang and fire. The heart is yang, yet the old woman is yin—why do they reside there?
**Answer:** The kidneys belong to *Kan*, where yin contains yang—this is true yang. The heart belongs to *Li*, where yang contains yin—this is true yin.

**Question:** Where is the muddy pellet palace?
**Answer:** The head has nine palaces; the central one is called the muddy pellet.

**Question:** What is the golden lord?
**Answer:** The golden-edged lord is lead. Purple Yang said: "One must seek and subdue the golden lord."

**Question:** What is the yellow matron?
**Answer:** Yellow is the color of earth, and its position belongs to *Kun*—hence the name. Purple Clarity said: "When the golden lord falls silent and the old woman dies, the yellow matron, though aged, still carries the embryo."

**Question:** What about breathing?
**Answer:** Exhalation issues from the heart and lungs; inhalation draws in the kidneys and liver. Exhalation connects to the celestial root; inhalation connects to the earthly root. When exhaling, the dragon sings and clouds arise; when inhaling, the tiger roars and winds stir. Breath and clouds congeal into the golden liquid.

**Question:** What are the nectar and jade fluid?
**Answer:** Both are divine water.

**Question:** What are spirit and qi?
**Answer:** Spirit is fire, and fire belongs to the heart. Qi is the medicine, and the medicine belongs to the body.

Spirit and qi are mother and child. Master Xu Jing of the Void Clarity said: "Qi is the origin of life; spirit is the regulator of life. To maintain fullness and govern spirit, concentrate qi and embrace it—spirit abides where qi dwells, and when spirit and qi unite, one may attain longevity." The Three Mao Perfected Lords said: "Qi is the elixir that adds years; the heart commands the spirit of qi. If one knows the master of circulating qi, one becomes an immortal."

**Question:** What are the Twelve Towers?
**Answer:** They are the twelve joints of the human throat.

**Question:** What are the curtain and screen?
**Answer:** They are the eyes. When practicing inner work, one contains the light within the cloud chamber—this is called "closing the door and lowering the curtain," silently observing within.

**Question:** What is *zi* and *wu*?
**Answer:** *Zi* and *wu* are the center of Heaven and Earth. In Heaven, they are the sun and moon; in humans, they are the heart and kidneys; in time, they are *zi* and *wu*; in the hexagrams, they are *Kan* and *Li*; in direction, they are north and south.

**Question:** What does it mean that the five positions interact and each has its correspondence?
**Answer:** The number of Heaven and Earth is fifty-five. Thus, *Qian* takes one, nine combines to make ten; *Kun* takes four, six combines to make ten; *Xun* and *Dui* take two, eight combines to make ten; *Zhen* and *Gen* take three, seven combines to make ten; *Li* takes five, *Kan* takes ten—*Kan* and *Li* have no pair, so they unite themselves. In terms of numbers, this is the central number of Heaven and Earth; in terms of lines, it is the central line of Heaven and Earth; in terms of position, it is the central place of Heaven and Earth. *Kan* and *Li* are the agents—how could their use not be great?

**Question:** What are the Five Peaks?
**Answer:** The *True Forms of the Five Peaks* states: "They are in the human head." Purple Clarity refers to the line, "With a kerchief, one conceals the Five Peaks crown."

**Question:** What is the Mysterious Female?
**Answer:** Above is called *xuan* (mysterious); below is called *pin* (female). The Mysterious Pass is a single aperture—on the left it is called *xuan*, on the right *pin*.

**Question:** What is the Gate of the Mysterious Female?
**Answer:** The nose connects to celestial qi—this is the *xuan* gate. The mouth connects to earthly qi—this is the *pin* door. Nose and mouth are the gates and doors of the Mysterious Female.

**Question:** What are the Three Sons and Three Daughters?
**Answer:** The Dao of *Qian* seeks *Kun*—the eldest son is *Zhen*, the middle son is *Kan*, the youngest son is *Gen*. The Dao of *Kun* seeks *Qian*—the eldest daughter is *Xun*, the middle daughter is *Li*, the youngest daughter is *Dui*.

**Question:** What are the Fire Dragon and Water Tiger?
**Answer:** The tiger is the metal of the west. Metal generates water, yet conceals its form within water. The dragon is the wood of the east. Wood generates fire, yet is restrained by fire. The Perfected Lord of Venus said: "The Five Phases do not proceed in order—the tiger is born within water. When the Five Phases are inverted, the dragon emerges from within fire."

**Question:** What are the solstices and equinoxes?
**Answer:** The *zi* hour corresponds to the winter solstice, when yin reaches its extreme and yang is born; the *wu* hour corresponds to the summer solstice, when yang reaches its extreme and yin is born; the *mao* hour corresponds to the spring equinox, when yang contains yin; the *you* hour corresponds to the autumn equinox, when yin contains yang. The human body also has solstices and equinoxes. Master Purple Yang said: "Divide the body and heart into the upper and lower arcs; distinguish the winter and summer solstices by spirit and qi."

**Question:** What is bathing?
**Answer:** When true qi steams and divine water irrigates, this is bathing. The Most High said: "Wash with sweet springs, cleanse away filth and grime. It issues from the Flowery Pond and later returns to the *Kun* door." Apricot Grove said: "Bathing relies on divine water—this is it."

**Question:** What is drawing and adding?
**Answer:** After drawing lead from behind the elbow, one must add mercury to the central yellow. The *Anthology of Transmitted Dao* said: "When it is time to draw, one must not fail to add."

**Question:** What is transporting?
**Answer:** Transport the golden essence from behind the elbow, move the jade fluid to the Mud Pill Palace—this is the foundational work, and the oral instructions are preserved therein.

**Question:** What are the Three Fields?
**Answer:** The brain is the Upper Field, the heart is the Middle Field, and the Sea of Qi is the Lower Field. If one obtains the mechanism of the Dipper’s handle to revolve them, then the upper and lower circulate like the flow of the Celestial River.

**Question:** What are the Three Passes behind the back?
**Answer:** Behind the brain is the Jade Pillow Pass; along the spine is the Narrow Pass; at the junction of water and fire is the Tail Gate Pass.

**Question:** What is the Spirit Chamber?
**Answer:** It is the chamber where the original spirit resides. Master Langran said: "Before understanding the Spirit Chamber, a thousand disturbances arise; once the Heart Field is enlightened, ten thousand affairs become idle."

**Question:** What is the Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown?
**Answer:** Spirit, qi, and essence merge into one. The Mysterious Pass is a single aperture—it is the culmination of spirit, qi, and essence.

**Question:** What is the Five Qi Returning to the Origin?
**Answer:** The true qi of the five viscera ascends to pay homage to the Celestial Origin.

**Question:** What is the Harmonizing and Uniting of the Four Images?
**Answer:** When the eyes do not see, the hun-soul resides in the liver; when the ears do not hear, the essence resides in the kidneys; when the tongue does not move, the spirit resides in the heart; when the nose does not smell, the po-soul resides in the lungs. Spirit, essence, hun-soul, and po-soul gather in the earth of intent.

**Question:** What are Horse Teeth, True Master, Spirit Talisman, and White Snow?
**Answer:** All are general names for lead and mercury.

**Question:** What is the River Chariot?
**Answer:** The correct qi of the north is called the River Chariot. On the left is the Sun Hub, on the right is the Moon Hub. It carries the correct qi, transports and stores the original yang, follows the seasons in its movement—all foundational work relies on the power of this chariot.

**Question:** What are old and tender?
**Answer:** When gathering the medicine, one must discern its oldness or tenderness. Peng Helin said: "When tender, gather it; when old, it withers." Master Purple Yang said: "When lead sees *gui* born, gather it swiftly; when gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste."

**Question:** What are floating and sinking?
**Answer:** Lead floats while silver sinks.

**Question:** What are clear and turbid?
**Answer:** Yang is clear and yin is turbid. The clear floats above, the turbid sinks below. In cultivating the elixir, one retains the clear and discards the turbid—for the clear belongs to yang and the turbid to yin.

**Question:** What is the mutual overcoming of the Five Phases?
**Answer:** The *Jinbi Jing* states: "Metal and Wood overcome each other, Water and Fire restrain each other. When Earth flourishes in Metal’s domain, the Three Agents perish, and the Four Seas press in—only then is great peace achieved. This is all due to the power of Earth, the virtue of the Central Palace."

**Question:** What is "coming and going"?
**Answer:** "From *zi* it goes, to *wu* it comes." The fire of the Yang tally advances from *zi* to *chen* and *si*; the tally of Yin retreats from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. Beginning in *fu* and ending in *kun*, all is governed by the trigrams. One wanes as the other waxes, one goes as the other comes—thus transformation is accomplished. As the *Yijing* says: "Closing the door is called *kun*; opening the door is called *qian*. One closing and one opening is called change; ceaseless coming and going is called penetration."

**Question:** What are female and male?
**Answer:** The female is Yin, the male is Yang. "One Yin and one Yang is called the Dao; solitary Yin or solitary Yang cannot generate on their own." The *Cantong Qi* states: "Male and female intermingle, seeking their kind." The commentary says: "The male is golden cinnabar; the female is fiery mercury. They mutually require and exhale, gathering by kind to generate and form the divine medicine."

**Question:** How does one guard against danger?
**Answer:** Guard against errors in the fire timing and shun confusion in dreams and waking. Master Cuixu said: "Essence arises at its appointed time; when the time comes, the spirit knows. Within the hundred divisions of the day, one must never be confused."

**Question:** What is union?
**Answer:** Like a lodestone drawing iron, they connect though separated by barriers.

**Question:** What are "having" and "lacking"?
**Answer:** The *Jinbi Jing* says: "Having and lacking mutually restrain; above dwells the Azure Dragon. The Two Lackings stem from One Having—its numinous transformations are wondrous and hard to fathom."

**Question:** What are punishment and virtue?
**Answer:** Yang is virtue; when virtue emerges, the myriad things live. Yin is punishment; when punishment emerges, the myriad things die. Thus, in the second month, Yang contains Yin, and the elm’s pods fall—this images golden cinnabar following Yin’s movements, falling into the womb, hence called "returning to the root." In the eighth month, Yin contains Yang, and the shepherd’s purse sprouts—this images Metal and Water following Yang’s nurturing fluids within the crucible. Therefore, *mao* and *you* are where punishment and virtue contend, Yin and Yang balance, and the tally fire rests.

**Question:** What are black and white?
**Answer:** The *Cantong Qi* says: "Know the white, guard the black, and the numinous brightness will come of itself." The white is Metal; the black is Water. Taking the root of Metal and Water as the foundation of the medicine.

**Question:** What are cold and heat?
**Answer:** Master Zhenyi said: "Do not rely on the clepsydra’s marks; when wind and rain are unregulated, drought and flood contend. Either the Yang fire exceeds its measure, or the Yin tally loses its rhythm. Deep winter turns to scorching summer; high summer reverses to thick frost. If the fire timing errs, the numinous mercury flees—those who tend the fire must be cautious."

**Question:** What are the dark and new moons?
**Answer:** The *Cantong Qi* says: "Between the dark and new moons, the tally aligns with the central path—this is when Metal and Water tally unite."

**Question:** What is sealing and securing?
**Answer:** The Perfected of Taibai said: "Seal the embryo to prevent leakage; transformation occurs in an instant." This means that when Water and Fire achieve balance, the divine chamber must be closed tightly to prevent any escape.

**Question:** What is the sacred embryo?
**Answer:** From formlessness arises form, coalescing into the sacred embryo. Guard and nurture it diligently—ten months like tending an infant. When a woman first conceives, it resembles a young dragon just beginning to nurture its pearl. For the spirit and qi have only just congealed, and carelessness can easily lead to loss.

**Question:** What are the Four Cardinal Points?
**Answer:** *Zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* are the Four Cardinal Points. The Mysterious Pass is the single aperture, the palace of the Four Cardinals.

**Question:** Where is the Yellow Court located?
**Answer:** Above the bladder, below the spleen, before the kidneys, to the left of the liver, and to the right of the lungs.

**Question:** What are the Golden Crow and Jade Hare?
**Answer:** The crow in the sun corresponds to the fluid in the heart; the hare in the moon corresponds to the qi in the kidneys.

**Question:** What is refining the form?
**Answer:** Refine the form to transform qi, refine qi to transform spirit, refine spirit to merge with the Dao. The Master of the Golden Grotto said: "Refining the form with essence is no ordinary cinnabar or stone."

**Question:** Master Ziyang said the heart and kidneys are not *kan* and *li*—why?
**Answer:** The heart and kidneys are merely the substance of *kan* and *li*; they have both substance and function.

**Question:** What is their function?
**Answer:** The Heavenly Heart is the function of the heart, belonging to *li*. The form is the function of the kidneys, belonging to *kan*. At the moment of union, these are what one employs.

**Question:** What is the work?
**Answer:** Knowing the time to unite, advancing the fire while guarding against danger, engaging in "wild battle" when Yang arises, bathing with punishment and virtue—all to warmly nurture and complete the elixir.

**Question:** What is "wild battle"?
**Answer:** The *Longhu Jing* says: "Civil means embrace gentleness; martial means suppress rebellion." Master Ziyang said: "Defending the city and waging wild battle reveal fortune and misfortune—only then does the numinous cinnabar fill the crucible red."

**Question:** What is warm nurturing?
**Answer:** Master Xinglin said: "Warm nurturing resembles the cycle of the stars." Master Piling said: "Keep the golden crucible always warm with broth; do not let the jade furnace grow cold with fire."

**Question:** What is refining and smelting?
**Answer:** Refining the golden crucible, smelting the jade furnace—here lies the oral transmission.

**Question:** What are reward and punishment?
**Answer:** The arising of spring’s qi is called reward—this is the Yang fire’s time before *si*. The killing of autumn’s qi is called punishment—this is the Yin tally’s time after *wu*.

**Question:** What is defending the city?
**Answer:** Embracing the origin and guarding the One, congealing spirit and gathering qi.

**Question:** What are dikes and defenses?
**Answer:** Driving out stray thoughts to focus the mind single-mindedly.

**Question:** What is the "divine hut"?
**Answer:** The nose, the gate through which spirit and qi enter and exit. The *Huangting Jing* says: "Within the divine hut, cultivation must be pursued; breath enters the hut to reach the cinnabar field."

**Question:** What is "Taiyi containing the true"?
**Answer:** Guarding the true One in the Heavenly Valley, qi enters the Mysterious Origin—thus one attains the original Heavenly True.

**Answer to the above:** "The true Dao nurtures the spirit—if one can guard it, I reside at the gate of dead qi, and the withered bones of seven ancestors all gain life-breath."

What gives me life is the Dao; what animates me is spirit. To guide spirit in guarding the Dao and nurture spirit with the Dao—this is the way.

**Question:** What are the Three Worms?
**Answer:** The *Zhonghuang Jing* states: The first is the upper worm, dwelling in the brain. The second is the middle worm, dwelling in the Hall of Light. The third is the lower worm, dwelling in the stomach and intestines. Their names are Peng Shan, Peng Zhi, and Peng Jiao. They despise one’s progress in the Dao and delight in one’s retreat from resolve. The Upper Field is the palace where the original spirit resides, yet people cannot open this gate. When the corpse-worms occupy it, the cycle of birth and death continues without end. If one can grasp the original spirit and settle it in its true palace, the corpse-worms will naturally perish, and the true breath will stabilize of itself. This is what is meant by "when one aperture opens, all apertures open together; when the great gate is unblocked, all the bones become free"—then the Heavenly True descends with its numinous power, and the spirit that is not spirit is thus made spirit.

**Question:** What is "embryonic breathing"?
**Answer:** If one can guard the true One, the breath comes and goes as if within the mother’s womb—this is called the Great Stabilization.

**Question:** What is the "Jade Pool within Kun"?
**Answer:** The mouth. The *Huangting Jing* says: "The Jade Pool’s clear water irrigates the numinous root."

**Question:** What is the "bellows and key"?
**Answer:** The *chong* is the bellows bag, and the *yue* is the three-holed flute. It is also the device blacksmiths use to blow air. Laozi said: "Between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows and key?" The *Shengjiang Lun* states: "If one can emulate the function of Heaven and Earth’s bellows and key—opening, qi issues forth; closing, qi enters—issuing forth like the Earth’s qi ascending, entering like Heaven’s qi descending. With each ascent and descent, one may attain the same longevity as Heaven and Earth."

**Question:** What are the "Five Sprouts"?
**Answer:** They are the true qi of the five viscera. The *Zhonghuang Jing* says: "If you can guard them, the Three Worms will depart, and you will behold the Five Sprouts and the Nine True Qi."

**Question:** What are "Zhun and Meng"?
**Answer:** The *Dao Shu* states: *Kan* is water. Its first transformation is the Water Marsh’s *Jie*; its second is the Water Thunder’s *Zhun*, with its line residing in *yin*. *Li* is fire. Its first transformation is the Fire Mountain’s *Lü*; its second is the Fire Wind’s *Ding*; its third is the Mountain Water’s *Meng*, with its line residing in *xu*. The regulation of water and fire lies in *yin* and *xu*, and the twelve hexagrams’ qi operate through *Zhun* and *Meng*.

**Question:** What does it mean to "gather the essence of the sun and the radiance of the moon"?
**Answer:** It does not refer to the external sun and moon but to gathering the true fluid within the heart and the true qi within the kidneys.

**Question:** What are the "inner and outer Eight Trigrams"?
**Answer:** The head is *Qian*, the feet are *Kun*, the bladder is *Gen*, the gall is *Xun*, the kidneys are *Kan*, the heart is *Li*, the liver is *Zhen*, and the lungs are *Dui*.

**Question:** What does it mean to "await the proper time before beginning cultivation"?
**Answer:** There is the work of the hour and the work of the moment. Piling said: "In refining the elixir, one need not seek the winter solstice—within the body, a yang naturally arises." Ma Ziran said: "Do not choose the hour to distinguish *zi* and *wu*; within the hexagrams, separate *Qian* and *Kun*." These are the works of the moment.

**Question:** What is the form of the Golden Elixir?
**Answer:** Its shape is like a pellet, its color like a red tangerine. The *Baopuzi* says: "Large as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine, within it a fine flavor sweet as honey. The śramaṇa obtains it for meditation; the Daoist in yellow robes obtains it to transcend. Examine it, practice it, and Heaven and Earth are complete." The *Yuanshu Song* says: "Have you not seen how a grain of Golden Elixir blazes red? Large as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine. Each person’s portion is originally complete; every night the numinous light fills the chamber." For each person is fully endowed, each is originally complete—know that it is not a material thing. Master Lü said: "The Returned Elixir is one’s original substance."

**Question:** Where exactly is the "Mysterious Pass"?
**Answer:** It is in the human head. The work is easy, but the starting point is hard to find. Without a true teacher’s transmission through the crown, all efforts are in vain.

**Question:** What is "true emptiness"?
**Answer:** Returning to the origin and restoring the primordial is true emptiness. Yaolin said: "Not knowing the marvelous elixir formula, one spends the whole day eating true emptiness."

**Question:** What is "application"?
**Answer:** Like the wasp adopting the larva, transmitting essence and conveying spirit.

**Question:** What is "spirit emergence"?
**Answer:** If one can guard the true One, the true blackness congeals of itself, and the yang spirit gathers of itself. For with the one heart, one moves all qi; when qi abides, spirit abides. Through long accumulation of true force, when the work is complete and conduct perfected, one then regulates the spirit to exit the shell.

**Question:** What is "transcendence"?
**Answer:** *Chao* means to exit—this is the emergence of spirit. *Tuo* means to shed the mortal frame—all depart through the Heavenly Gate. The ancient sages had verifications of shedding the shell: the Sixth Patriarch emerged from a seven-tiered pagoda, Zhong and Lü emerged from a three-story red tower, and Lord Haichan soared out through the Heavenly Gate on a crane. A poem says:
*When the work is complete, you must exit the capital of spirit;*
*The inner court’s splendor must not burden your body.*
*Master the Five Immortals’ method of transcendence,*
*Refine the immortal substance and leave the mortal dust.*

**Question:** What is "liberation through the corpse"?
**Answer:** There are five kinds of liberation through the corpse: gold, wood, water, fire, and earth. There are also those who accumulate merit and amass conduct to ascend in broad daylight. At the end of Emperor Huizong’s *Zun Dao Pian*, it is written: "From ancient times to the present, those who have ascended in flight number over a thousand, and those who have raised their households number over eighty." From the *Zhen Gao*.

**Question:** Is the Way of the Golden Elixir not also difficult?
**Answer:** It is not difficult. Master Ziyang said: "For the awakened, it is only simple and easy; for the deluded, it grows ever more complex and hard." Yaolin said: "The words of simplicity take no more than half a sentence; the verification of efficacy lies in a single moment." Cuixu said: "The medicine is not far, nor is its gathering difficult." Piling said: "The supreme Dao is not complex—people merely obscure it." Ziqing said: "A single word threads through ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures; but a moment’s work brings boundless ease and joy." The Master said: "The initial work is easy; the difficulty lies in steadfastly guarding the Dao."

**Eighty-One Quatrains on the Profound Mystery of the Sevenfold Obstruction**

**I**
Laozi clearly opened the gate of all wonders,
Opening and closing in accord with Heaven and Earth.
In the formless realm of boundless vastness,
Lies the root of endless life, deathless and true.

**II**
Those who attain the Dao need not be in their prime,
The jade furnace tends the fire, never idle.
On Kunlun’s peak, along the Yellow Flower Path,
The primordial spirit is drawn forth, then returns again.

**III**
The Great Dao is fundamentally nonbeing,
Yet if one guards the One, the spirit abides.
This heart, bright as the moon in a pool’s depths,
Unentangled by the slightest thread, is naturally free.

**IV**
No treasure surpasses mercury and lead,
Gathered in season, then refined and smelted.
The supreme Dao has never been complex—
Only that people fail to grasp it whole.

**V**
The wondrous work of the Three Fields moves up and down,
Naturally uniting East and West as one.
Laughing, one points to Kunlun’s summit:
Through the spine’s cleft, a clear path runs.

**VI**
Stir the celestial wheel to turn sun and moon,
In an instant, the sea stirs, clouds and thunder rise.
When the surging waves settle into stillness,
They scatter as sweet springs, moistening the nine realms.

**VII**
This secret, clearly spoken to the wise:
In movement seek stillness, in subtlety find mystery.
My family’s livelihood has always been distinct—
Nightly, we cultivate the lotus within the fire.

**VIII**
This Dao is profound, yet within it lies deeper subtlety,
Father and son through the ages do not transmit it.
Do not treat the firing times as child’s play—
With a true master, study it in meticulous detail.

**IX**
The great medicine consists of three: essence, qi, and spirit,
Naturally, mother and child embrace in intimacy.
Returning wind blends them into the true body,
Daily, the work of refinement renews.

**X**
Water and fire have always dwelt together,
Seen, they seem present; sought, they vanish.
With care, harmonize the civil and martial,
In a moment, you will congeal the jade nectar.

**XI**
With a gentle flame, nurture the hidden dragon,
When it resides in the field, all is as one.
When the three yangs meet in the *Tai* hexagram,
Only then may you advance the fire of divine work.

**XII**
Discern *Zhun* and *Meng* before and after the crescent,
Advance and retreat, draw and add—govern the firing work.
Guard against danger, take heed of peril—bathe in vigilance,
The returning elixir sheds its form, entering the *Kun* palace.

**XIII**
Wood-fluid and metal-essence dwell in *Mao* and *You*,
Only proper bathing suits the Great Elixir’s head.
Thrice thrice, irrigate with the water of spirit,
No need for laborious work with the fire-ox.

**XIV**
By the hour, replace the day—this is the divine work,
Study it carefully, for all is ultimately one.
Nine fortnights, nine revolutions make nine cycles,
The golden elixir returns, entering the *Kun* palace.

**XV**
Within a single hour, the returning elixir coalesces,
Seizing the great work of Heaven and Earth.
Gather the remnants of the golden fluid,
Lest they scatter with the rain and wind.

**XVI**
Wood and metal, though separated, must unite,
White snow and yellow sprout share a single bud.
With unwavering intent, proceed with the firing times,
Then from the *Fu* hexagram, move the initial line.

**XVII**
When clouds disperse and rain ceases, the elixir congeals,
Lute and zither harmonize, the work is complete.
Beware—do not continue the firing times,
Ignorance of when to stop invites peril.

**XVIII**
Few know the lead furnace and mercury tripod,
Wood-fluid and metal-essence flourish in season.
In the wild battle, you must proceed with the firing times,
Draw and add, apply without delay.

**XIX**
In the gate of sixteen, the enlightened are rare,
Before and after the crescent—this is the proper time.
With care, harmonize the civil and martial,
Truly, within nothingness, the child is nurtured.

**XX**
The golden crow nightly lodges in the Western River,
When *Li* and *Kan* unite, the mystery deepens.
Nurturing the infant relies solely on the mother,
The external furnace augments the work, circling the celestial sphere.

**XXI**
When yang revives within the body at winter solstice,
It is time to approach the furnace and refine the great elixir.
Rely on the Yellow Dame to act as matchmaker,
Husband and wife share the chamber in harmonious joy.

**XXII**
Precisely aligned, wondrous beyond compare,
At mid-autumn, when the moon in the sky is full.
As yang arises, swiftly gather—do not delay,
Advance the fire with vigilance against peril.

**XXIII**
Refining the elixir, discern the work with care,
Day and night, diligently tend the medicine furnace.
If you encounter the first yang just rising in *Fu*,
Gather it tender—left too long, it withers.

**XXIV**
Living lead and living mercury are the elixir’s ancestors,
Betrothed as husband and wife, sharing one heart.
From this, draw and add, then advance the fire,
The jade furnace refines them into a single golden mass.

**XXV**
Yin and yang return and coalesce into the elixir,
Nine cycles complete, the fire’s power unbroken.
When it reaches the *Kun* palace and receives its fill of qi,
Only then may you bathe, trusting to nature.

**XXVI**
Advance the fire in due season, be earnest and focused,
Do not let the restless monkey grasp at random.
When the flower’s dew first opens, avoid touching it,
Seal it in the earthen crucible, do not withdraw the bolt.

**XXVII**
Above and below, the Three Palaces, the three-inch fields,
Cultivate, plant, and refine them yourself.
Gather in season, be thorough and precise,
Advance and retreat, draw and add—mirror the waxing and waning moon.

**XXVIII**
When the peaches in the women’s garden ripen,
Pluck and consume them without delay.
How many times have you secretly reached out—
Countless immortals remain unaware.

**XXIX**
Mature lead and mature mercury are most fit for refining,
Who says the golden elixir cannot be formed?
If students regularly partake of them,
They will witness the white sun and sprouting wings.

**XXX**
If students seek the yellow sprout,
The two sources share a single root.
Recognize the host in seven returns and nine revolutions,
Not a hair’s breadth of effort may be amiss.

**XXXI**

**XXXI**
Yin dwells above, yang resides below,
Yang’s qi ascends first, yin follows after.
Where tiger and dragon unite in embrace,
This moment is like crossing a narrow bridge.

**XXXII**
Harmonizing lead and mercury takes not the whole day,
Secure the root-source to nurture the sacred embryo.
First let the sun’s soul seize the moon’s spirit,
Yin’s script and yang’s martial force move the primal line.

**XXXIII**
Nine hidden dragons return as one yang,
Clearly the transformation lies at the center.
The *xun*-wind’s breath blows the dry fire,
Refined in the crucible, it surpasses frost.

**XXXIV**
In the jade crucible, the elixir of immortality is forged,
In the golden tripod, the deathless cinnabar is fired.
Invert *kan* and *li*, align with *wu* and *ji*,
Distinguish the allies—my life is not ruled by heaven.

**XXXV**
Waking from wine at midnight’s third watch,
I feel passion deepen, intent grow keen.
In the jade grotto, I test the sacred sword’s strike—
At once the tiger roars and the dragon sings.

**XXXVI**
The river chariot transports to Kunlun’s peak,
Not a hair’s breadth stirs before reaching the jade pass.
The marvel lies in the eight gates sealed tight,
Yin and yang’s single qi circulates of itself.

**XXXVII**
Wine is a fine friend, flowers a companion,
At the ridge’s crest, the purple river chariot is harnessed.
Alas! The golden tiger’s single roar—
Blows apart the five-colored clouds in the blue sky.

**XXXVIII**
Gazing from the western bank’s shore,
Endless toad-light dips into the azure waves.
Now is the time to refine the two eights with care,
And entrust the task to the yellow matron with diligence.

**XXXIX**
In the jade crucible and golden tripod, the medicine vies in brilliance,
Purple mists and crimson clouds illuminate the chamber.
At this very moment, gather it diligently—
The primordial spirit returns to its chamber, no longer flying astray.

**XL**
Within the cinnabar tripod, the yellow blossom blooms,
In the crescent moon furnace, the jade flower unfurls.
Advance and retreat, shorten and lengthen—gather with diligence,
All at once, collect it into the yellow house.

**XLI**
Within non-effort, effort must be diligent,
Beyond effort, no effort aligns with sacred work.
Refine the cinnabar field into the supreme treasure,
Let the crow and hare race east and west as they will.

**XLII**
The flowing stream ascends straight to Penglai,
Scattering as sweet springs to moisten the nine realms.
From this, the cinnabar field is bathed in moisture,
Yellow sprouts open everywhere at once.

**XLIII**
The mysterious pearl is transported to Kunlun’s peak,
The two vermilion gates of sun and moon stand idle.
Seize the four snakes and the two rats,
Tiger and dragon unite in embrace—all in an instant.

**XLIV**
The Primordial Lord sits in solemn repose in the Dark Capital,
The threefold embryo immortals dance in the eight directions.
The transformation of one yang shakes heaven and earth,
Through this wondrous work, great peace arises.

**XLV**
Two swords hang at the southern palace’s corners,
The carefree primordial spirit pays homage to the Jade Emperor.
After this meeting in the celestial palace,
Walking the jade steps becomes an ordinary affair.

**XLVI**
Misty clouds veil the twelve towers,
In the crimson palace, all is still—ten thousand spirits roam.
If one asks where my home is,
I occupy the most exalted scenery.

**XLVII**
Time and again, I shake off dust to ascend Kunlun,
Moving the pivot of the cosmos, parting creation.
Day and night, cycling endlessly in return,
The infant’s life endures from this moment on.

**XLVIII**
The jade crucible emits swirling clouds,
The golden valley nurtures purple mushrooms in mist.
Diligently irrigate with divine water,
Lest the fire dragon flee in haste.

**XLIX**
The white tiger of the western mountains runs wild,
The azure dragon of the eastern sea cannot be withstood.
If the mother of *kun* comes to subdue them,
Seize them together and hide them in the grotto.

**L**
When heretical demons suddenly display their might,
Brandish the seven-starred sword and advance.
Indeed, at the battleground of the ghost’s den,
Seize a single luminous pearl and return.

**LI**
The natural ancestral shrine is the single spirit terrace,
Within it lies the immortal, deathless embryo.
After the wondrous cycling of yin and yang’s return,
The eight gates of the hexagram’s qi swing open.

**LII**
Within the body, one aperture is called the mysterious female,
Located at the crossroads of the three passes.
If one knows the time and can wield it,
Wood and metal merge, naturally sinking and floating.

**LIII**
Split open the mysterious female to reveal the twin gates,
The forging work is no ordinary task.
For scholars to know the precise point,
Face the Northern Dipper and look south.

**LIV**
The root and stem of the great Dao are known by few,
How could common folk recognize its daily use?
For you, I point out the immortal’s cave—
A single aperture, curved like the crescent moon.

**LV**
Time and again, I shake off dust to ascend Kunlun,
Treading the mysterious pass, the gate of all wonders.
Wielding the sword, I split open heaven and earth’s lock,
The golden crow and jade hare devour each other.

**LVI**
Last night, the divine maiden opened the numinous door,
I glimpsed immortals gathering in the Purple Tenuity.
The Northern Dipper and Southern Asterism arrayed front and back,
The two wheels of sun and moon flew to and fro.

**LVII**
Ponder it carefully—how wondrous it is!
Each morning, I urge the nine rosy clouds’ cup.
If you can make the earthly soul transport essence and turn,
The celestial soul will naturally come to bless your longevity.

**LVIII**
Refining the self and cultivating the heart hold the deepest meaning,
To cultivate the heart, one must recognize heaven’s heart.
The immortal’s wondrous secret is not complex—
Refine the yang spirit to dissolve the host of yin.

**LIX**
From Kunlun’s peak straight to the mud pill,
All day, I climb and descend of my own accord.
If you seek long life and transcendence,
In the end, you will not depart from your own body.

**LX**
Within the tiny pot, another heaven unfolds,
An iron ox plows the land to sow golden lotuses.
Such scenes exist in every household,
Yet why do people of this age not learn immortality?

**LXI**
In the depths of the azure pool, seize the luminous pearl,
Toss it upward with a flip of the hand to the great void.
Entrust it to the yellow matron to gather,
Transforming it into golden liquid, congealing into butter.

**LXII**
To refine the elixir, seek the root-source,
Born in the prior heaven and the posterior heaven.
If the valley spirit is forever undying,
Why fear this body will not become immortal?

**LXIII**
Clinging to texts and muddying images are not real,
Only by attaining the image and forgetting words does one approach truth.
Generally, refining the elixir follows images and models,
For all ten thousand transformations originate in the human body.

**LXIV**
The immortal classics speak in myriad layers,
Yet the Dao lies in the common person’s daily use.
If you can invert and cycle it yourself,
No need to traverse ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains.

**LXV**
How many have been vexed in seeking immortality,
Loving the cultivation of truth yet not recognizing truth.

**LXVI**
If you obtain the red lead and black mercury,
Refine them into the supreme treasure, transcending the dusty world.

**LXVII**
Though but a tiny crucible within,
Above and below mirror heaven and earth in their patterns.
If you know the time and can apply it,
The golden crow and jade hare will come from west to east.

**LXVIII**
To realize non-doing is true doing,
Quietly cultivate the wondrous principle, delighting in the subtle.
Standing at the river’s edge through many cycles of sun and moon,
You cast your line to hook the black turtle.

**LXIX**
At Jade Capital’s Primordial Beginning, upon the jasper terrace,
Purple qi congeals in the void as palace gates swing open.
Knock thrice or four times at the western grotto’s gate,
And the immortals of the nine heavens all arrive as one.

**LXX**
In the midst of vagueness dwells the purest essence,
Dragon’s chant and tiger’s roar are most worth hearing.
The dark pearl flies past Kunlun’s heights,
The river chariot of day and night never pauses.

**LXXI**
Alone I tread Kunlun’s slopes, gazing into the distant void,
Dragon’s hum and tiger’s roar are perfectly clear.
The jade pool constantly drips the marrow of yin and yang,
The golden tripod ever cooks the essence of sun and moon.

**LXXII**
Within this body lies one’s own essence and qi,
Why trouble others with petty inquiries?
Begin swift cultivation—even now it is late—
I urge you: turn back, do not procrastinate.

**LXXIII**
How many in this world taste bitterness of heart,
Failing to comprehend true cultivation, they harm their own truth.
Essence leaks, qi withers, spirit departs,
Piercing the numinous to enter another shell, lost in the ford.

**LXXIV**
The prior heaven and prior earth hold the profoundest mystery,
Those of shallow fortune cannot encounter it.
Once true lead is gathered, refine it swiftly—
I urge you: do not delay further.

**LXXV**
Disciples fail to recognize the gold within water,
Seeking it haphazardly in all directions.
Only black lead is the supreme treasure,
Originally dwelling in the *dui* position, lodged in *ren*.

**LXXVI**
Disciples fail to recognize the lead of the watery realm,
Where yin and yang are inverted, the position belongs to *qian*.
Vaguely it dwells in the *kan* position,
Yet clearly it is born at the edge of the *dui* palace.

**LXXVII**
To refine the returning elixir, first enter the chamber,
No different from a woman conceiving.
Once the sacred embryo congeals and rounds into completion,
Its comings and goings, its movements and stillness, know no constraint.

**LXXVIII**
Do not deceive with exposed heart and split belly—
Hasten to tend the great medicine furnace yourself.
Seek the *jiazi* within sixty *jia*,
Devote your efforts within three thousand days.

**LXXIX**
Some heterodox schools indulge in lust,
Forcing yang to return, they seize another’s yin.
Holding heaven’s dew in the mouth, they call it medicine,
Like dredging mud, their efforts are in vain.

**LXXX**
Sealing the tail gate, they claim it as the Dao,
Yet where are the tiger’s roar and dragon’s chant?
The primal yang stirs without walls or barriers,
Mistaking yellow mud for gold.

**LXXXI**
The great medicine of the golden elixir is most profound,
The celestial mechanism of the highest realm is not idly transmitted.
I report to recent cultivators of the Dao:
To refine essence without ceasing is also futile.

**LXXXII**
Having received the immortal master’s true oral formula,
I dare reveal the subtle in these humble lines.
Let disciples thoroughly investigate this,
For within these poems, every verse exposes the mechanism.

*Collected Writings on Cultivating Truth: The Great Compendium of the Golden Elixir, Scroll Twelve* (begins)

**The Song of Delighting in the Dao**
*Composed by Zixu Liaozhenzi Xiao Tingzhi Yuanrui*

Abandoning delusion to return to truth, hidden amidst worldly dust,
Refining lead, simmering mercury—coalescing the returning elixir.
Men of this age scorn the Way of long life,
Their hearts ensnared by sound and form, lost in dreams.

Liaozhenzi delights in the Dao,
Marvelous indeed—turning the heart early.
Fleeting fame, fleeting gain—all empty splendor,
In this world, only cultivating truth is good.

Speak of cultivating truth—many do,
Yet none grasp its inner or outer workings.
By chance, on Elixir Mountain, I met a perfected one,
A single word from him shattered all my doubts.

Returning with the formula, I tested its refinement:
Dragon and tiger clashed in but a moment.
Clouds gathered, rain dispersed—all sounds stilled,
Yet through the night, wind and rain shook ten thousand peaks.

Clearing land, cutting thatch to build the spirit-chamber,
Sealing the pass, cutting off the vulgar and the foul.
Motionless in the thatched hut, guarding the One,
The jade furnace tended, its fire never idle.

From now on, I trample the gate of life and death,
Leap free from the demon’s pass.
On Kunlun’s summit, I may come and go,
At times leading the primordial spirit forth and back again.

Delighting in the Dao, refining the golden elixir,
The five qi harmonized, the jade cavern vast.
Clapping hands, I laugh and blow the flute without holes,
Tossing the mysterious pearl through nine bends.

When lead-dragon and mercury-tiger mate,
In an instant, flames soar, scorching the heavens.
Regulating the fire’s work demands care,
Neither rigid nor yielding—neither civil nor martial—restrain the will.

Morning and evening, hexagrams *Tun* and *Meng* hold sovereign and minister,
Knowing sufficiency, ever sufficient, return to the root.
Advance must be brief, retreat must be long,
Spring, summer, autumn, winter—follow the sequence.

The twenty-eight constellations gather in one crucible,
Water and fire must distinguish front and rear ranks.
Hexagrams *Fu* and *Lin* require gentle nurturing,
While *Guan* and *Yu* demand withdrawal for bathing.

The work of return enters the *Kun* palace,
Refined into something firm and solid as a single mass.
Such skill emerges from the master’s hand—
I ask those of this age: do you comprehend?

Liaozhenzi delights in the Dao,
Marvelous indeed—turning the heart early.
With soiled face and disheveled hair, as it pleases,
In solitude, no one disturbs my peace.

Thirst quenched with golden and jade nectars,
Hunger sated with intersecting pears and fiery jujubes.
The twin wheels of sun and moon drift west and east,
Gazing upward, I fathom the workings of creation.

The west, *Dui*’s metal, belongs to *You*,
The east, *Zhen*’s wood, belongs to *Mao*.
The numinous terrace gleams, untended by men,
The mysterious altar stands silent, unswept.

Refining essence into qi, qi into spirit,
Yet the greatest treasure is essence and spirit as one.
Metal and wood naturally converge,
Water fears excess, fire fears dryness.

Like a dragon nurturing its pearl, ever watchful,
Like a hen brooding her eggs, ever embracing.
The golden liquid returning elixir lies before your eyes—
Many are lost, few awaken.

Some refine and consume it day and night,
Its flavor surpassing fine wine—truly exquisite.
Ask me of my present practice:
It does not depart from the true aperture at the crown.

Emerging from the void’s misty expanse,
Prior to heaven, prior to earth—this is the great Dao.
If disciples awaken to the great returning elixir,
Within this song, seek its subtleties.

Should I mislead disciples by even a hair’s breadth,
Ten thousand kalpas of wind and blade await my trial.

**The Song of Contentment in the Thatched Hut**

A thatched hut, seven feet high,
Nine feet wide when laid crosswise.
One carefree master dwells within,
Dreading guests who bring disturbance.

Hungry, a few plain rice grains suffice,
Weary, sleep comes with clothes still on.
For love of this tranquility,
All affairs are cast aside.

Nightly by Qujiang’s bend,
I scoop water to toy with the bright moon.
With both feet upturned, inverting the Dipper,
I settle my breath, concentrate my spirit, and enter the qi’s fullness.

Jade nectar, brewed, descends from heaven,
Flowing over my tongue, sweet as honey.
Nine cups drunk, then nine more,
Now clear, now rich—I sip at leisure.

This realm—how wondrous, how rare!
Drunk, I embrace Yang Fei in shared delight.
Within this body, husband and wife reside,
Mother and child in one form, vivid and alive.

Like a dragon nurturing its pearl, never forgetting,
Like a hen brooding her eggs, qi unbroken.
As the cold cicada sips the dawn breeze,
As the old oyster holds the autumn moon.

Drunk, I sing aloud, shouting once—
The void shatters like autumn’s finest hair.
Truly content—few understand,
Vague and indistinct, as if mad.

Gazing upward, I marvel at creation’s work:
The sun returns eastward, the moon still west.
Seizing the sun’s soul and moon’s spirit,
One floats, one sinks—the pearl takes flight.

Silently moving heaven and earth through *Pi* and *Tai*,
*Tun* and *Meng*’s ebb and flow—advance and retreat.
Metal and wood naturally resolve their union,
Mutual generation and conquest hold subtle mysteries.

Before the furnace, apply the firing regimen—restrain the will,
The divine water’s bathing demands caution against peril.
In a year’s twelve months,
Wood’s liquid and metal’s essence shun the hare and cock.

In the tenth month, the embryo is shed, swallowed into the belly,
The ninefold work completed in an instant.
Do not treat the fire’s timing as child’s play—
With immortals, ponder it carefully.

If the return deviates by even a hair’s breadth,
Mercury flees, lead scatters—they fail to unite.
Disciples, in this, reflect deeply:
From seven sevens comes forty-eight.

Between heaven and earth, the numbers do not escape,
This is the most profound oral formula.
If the Silver River meets the Dipper and Ox,
Seal the furnace tightly—do not leak lightly.

Do not let gods or ghosts witness the work’s beginning,
Simmering the jade furnace into white snow.
Mercury was originally the black turtle’s liver,
Cinnabar is the red phoenix’s blood.

There is civil and martial, rigid and yielding,
Advance and retreat, coming and going—distinguish them finely.
Nurturing the infant, waging wild battle,
The work within the moment must be spoken.

Truly content—few understand,
In the thatched hut’s wild seclusion, few tread.
With soiled face and disheveled hair, delighting in the Dao,
Like a fish drinking water—only I know.

Amid clouds, drinking alone, toasting in rounds,
Beneath pines, reciting poems without rhyme.
On the five peaks, autumn high, white phoenixes soar,
In the nine springs, spring warm, black turtles nurture.

My own yang spirit leaps exultantly,
While yin ghosts darkly grieve.
Primordial essence, endlessly refined,
Jade nectar, ever consumed—never apart.

My family’s livelihood differs in its work,
Not to be spoken of to ordinary men.
Few understand—truly content,
Having grasped heaven’s mechanism, ever as if drunk.

Drunk, I pluck a stringless zither,
Each note within its sound instructs my child in detail.
Exhort the worthy, shun the base and greedy,
Hasten to seek a master, grasp the subtle pointer—
If in this life you fail to awaken to true cultivation,
Next life may not grant such fortune again.
Turn back, seize the Purple Gold Elixir,
Refine it, and you ascend as an immortal.

**Sword Song**
Two branches of wisdom-swords buried in true earth,
Drawn from their sheaths, they roar like storm and rain.
Without these tools for elixir-refining,
A thousand scholars, ten thousand will err.
Only the meticulous grasp the sword’s secret,
Wielding its essence, they move through the ages.
Knowing the time, they soar into the Great Empyrean,
Clearly finding the path of yin and yang.
Seizing the Jade Hare, it dares not move,
Within the furnace, cinnabar finds its place.
Discern its age, judge its floating and sinking,
Advance and retreat, distinguish host and guest.
In an instant, flames soar to scorch the heavens,
Forging the mysterious essence—subtle, hard to perceive.
Though its cries seem mournful and bitter,
It clings ever fondly to its nurturing mother.
To subdue the fiery dragon-child,
Go north to seek the watery tiger.
Dragon meets tiger, they coil and entwine,
Vaguely, dimly, forming a single mass.
The River Chariot bears it to Kunlun’s peak,
Sealed in the earthen crucible, the gate unopened.
Breath upon breath, unbroken as silk,
Embrace the One, guard unity with utmost focus.
Jade nectar ferments, descending from heaven,
Fragrant and sweet, it suffuses the tongue’s tip.
Refine it, consume it, let it enter the five viscera—
This alone is called the Great Return Elixir.
Chronic ailments vanish, spirit and qi refreshed,
Four limbs harmonized, the body sound and serene.
True fire has always arisen from wood,
But without skill in tempering, do not force the drill.
The jade furnace’s fire and timing must be gauged—
Fire fears cold, water fears drought.
If you obtain the true sword-secret from a master,
How could cultivation be difficult?
From iron cliffs and hanging walls, lingering snow,
In the jade casket’s depths, the old dragon coils.
The Flowery Pond’s divine water polishes it to brilliance,
Knowing the time, lift and pluck it at will.
Should you encounter the solemn and stern, report swiftly,
For heterodox demons will tremble in dread.
Breaking the Primordial Chaos, chiseling the Undifferentiated,
You ensure its coming and going without flaw.
Focus the mind, steady the will—no need for haste,
Left and right, wield it with measured grace.
This song I leave for those who meet the sword,
Ponder it deeply, and it may serve as your guide.

**Farewell Song to Hermit Chen, Departing for Mount Wuyi**
Knocking at my gate, you bid me farewell,
I open the door, cherishing but a moment’s pause.
The Dao resides within—seek it not without,
Wandering ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains is vain.
Listen now, let me speak—
Few words, yet the true marvelous secret:
When the dragon sings and the tiger roars in the deep night,
Swiftly drive the River Chariot without pause,
In an instant, bear it to the Mud Pill Palace’s peak,
Advance the fire in the jade furnace, smelting like snow.
The Flowery Pond’s divine water, limpid and clear,
Irrigates the yellow sprout in due season.
Jade nectar, ambrosia—swallow it often,
The four limbs steam, the complexion transformed.
Side doors and minor methods number in the thousands,
But only this Dao is most direct.
Without, it is neither cinnabar nor sulfur,
Within, it is neither essence nor blood.
Round, it rolls over land, ever companion,
Crimson, glistening, radiant and pure.
Knowing the time, gather it when it comes,
Seal the divine furnace, guard it well.
Nine returns, seven reversals—an instant’s work,
The sacred bellows blow, aided by the dawn wind.
To recognize the Mysterious Pass’s true location,
The laughing child points to the highest peak.
The highest peak, fair and wondrous,
On its far shore, misty purple mushrooms sprout.
This alone is the herb of immortality,
Yet countless cultivators remain unaware.
I dash off these few lines, spilling heaven’s mechanism—
You strap on your straw sandals and depart,
But when, after all, will you return?
I send word to the immortals: do not speculate,
Wait until my work is complete,
Then I shall surely come to Wuyi, bones transformed.

**Song for Mount Zou’s Peak**
You and I unravel the diagrams and texts,
Grasping at emptiness—what form does it take?
The mechanism lies in the heart, skill in the hand,
From nothing, something is born.
The perfected one wields the twin swords—
Male and female, they soar through the great void,
Wielding thunder and lightning.
At midnight, when they roar,
They point and shatter the faces of yin demons.
Seizing the luminous pearl, they return,
Not to be shown to ordinary men.
A single clash settles great peace,
The Primordial Lord sits enthroned in the Three Clarities’ hall.
The delicate maiden weds the Golden Duke,
In the bridal chamber’s depths, clouds and rain thicken.
The fair-faced young lord rides the white tiger,
The green-clad maiden straddles the green dragon.
By the Cowherd and Weaver’s river, they meet,
Then lock the gate within the Central Palace.

Cultivating the natural true fire-timing,
Stirring the heavens to forge a crimson crucible.
The Golden Duke falls silent, the Crone perishes—
Nine returns, seven reversals, all in a moment’s work.
Had not the chill of Ou’s transmission passed down the sword’s secret,
How could a path open through the azure vault?

This livelihood rests solely in the twin swords,
Sharp as wind, swift as water through a

**Eight**
The twin gates of the spine pierce the crown—
this is the mystic gate of the Great Dao.
Golden elixir springs from this very root;
its great essence lies in knowing when to move.

Temper the wild battles, guard the city walls,
swallow often the jade liquid of the Flower Pool.
Keep the jade crucible ever warm with gentle fire,
discerning the herb’s ripeness or tenderness.

**Nine**
The art of fire-tempering is no small skill—
a hair’s breadth misstep brings vast difference.
If the crucible’s mercury flees and black lead takes flight,
from this moment your resolve may falter.

Seek a true master’s counsel in detail,
lest reckless action lead you astray.
Subtle and profound, the deepest mechanism—
even in speech, restraint is required.

**Ten**
At the Nine-Bend River’s head, against the raging waves,
in an instant you surge past the heart of heaven.
Atop Kunlun’s peak, the waters settle clear—
fermented, the nectar of jade is yours to drink.

Now is the time to gather and refine,
the River Chariot’s movement never ceasing.
Yin and yang, black and white, rise and sink—
lock the Jade Gate fast, secure and firm.

**Eleven**
The medicine arises in the southwest, in the earth of Kun,
the golden elixir’s root lies solely here.
Let the seeker ponder deeply, trace its mystery—
no marvel surpasses the true seed.

Once this is accomplished, all ten thousand things are complete;
no need to divide east, west, south, or north.
Clinging to texts and rigid forms—how can one penetrate?
Like a mute describing dreams.

**Twelve**
The Great Dao of golden liquid and returning elixir,
passed down once in ten thousand kalpas by the ancients.
With whole heart they laid bare its secrets,
guiding others to transcend and reach the Dao’s shore.

Do not blame the leaking of heaven’s mechanism—
beyond this mystery, there is no deeper mystery.
Handed down through ten thousand generations to the worthy,
those with eyes may clearly see.

---

**Twelve Songs of Nanxiang**
*(Named for the southwest, the birthplace of the medicine.)*

**One**
True mercury and true lead,
born in the prior heaven and the posterior heaven.
Know the time, diligently gather—
profound, profound!
With the proper measure, why fear not attaining immortality?

Advance the fire with utmost focus,
examining the waxing and waning crescents.
Withdraw at *Zhun*, cease at *Meng*—
hard to transmit!
A hair’s breadth error, and the elixir will not form.

**Two**
With both hands part the primordial chaos,
the sword of wisdom flies to the first peak.
Outer paths and asuras shrink back in awe—
such power!
Creation’s workings lie originally in your palm.

The jade crucible glows red,
the bellows blow, fanned by the wind of *Xun*.
After ten months, the embryo is cast off, swallowed into the belly—
in the palace of Kun,
you stand face-to-face with the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Elder.

Laozi said: *"The Three Pure Ones are within yourself—
why gaze upward in vain?"*

**Three**
Tempering follows the celestial cycle,
requiring the gentlest fire’s fullness.
Cherish the infant, relying on the mother—
three years,
the work of withdrawal and addition mirrors the moon’s phases.

At the meeting of Ox and Dipper by the river,
cast aside the dark pearl, plant the jade field.
Fix the mind unwavering, conduct the fire’s timing—
with precision,
the secrets are laid bare for the worthy.

**Four**
*Jia* gives birth, then *Geng* is born—
this is the elixir’s head, a crucial clarity.
Gather the tender medicine, return it to the earthen crucible,
simmer and refine,
proceeding with civil and martial, soft and firm in due order.

In a moment, the elixir forms—
bathe it, guard against danger, defend the city.
At this stage, no need to tend the fire;
hold fullness—
if fire is added now, it will surely topple.

**Five**
Wood Hare and Metal Rooster,
punishment and virtue stand at the gate, paired and singular.
Within the crucible, cinnabar must be bathed,
guard against danger—
divine water, brimming, fills the Jade Pool.

Years, months, days, and hours,
the work within each moment is uniformly pursued.
Diligently study the elixir’s hasty creation—
a hair’s breadth—
ten months of care will preserve it.

**Six**
The crucible’s form follows heaven and earth,
above is the celestial origin, below the terrestrial.
If you can further invert and circulate,
exchanging turns,
the opening and closing cycle through the eight gates.

Transport it upward to Kunlun,
where Tortoise and Serpent brothers naturally swallow and spit.
At the hundred-foot pole, hold fast the line—
climb and pull—
from this, the original spirit and life endure forever.

**Seven**
The gates and locks encircle the heavens,
ascending and descending through the three-inch field.
Not in forced exhalation or breath-counting,
but naturally—
the nine revolutions suffer no lack, the fire’s power complete.

Embryonic breathing, slow and flowing,
depends on yin and yang, neither leaning to one side.
Breath and blow all rely on *Xun*—
fine as silk—
the marvel lies in the waxing and waning crescents.

**Eight**
*Fu* trigram begins with the hidden dragon,
*Wu* and *Ji* gently harmonize—do not attack.
At nine-two, the dragon appears, master of the hexagram—
such power!
From this, the crucible’s stages turn crimson in order.

When *Tai* hexagram is met,
fierce fire burns the dry, fanned by *Xun*’s wind.
Refined, the yellow sprout and white snow—
wondrous work!
Returning to Kun’s path, the beginning is exhausted.

**Nine**
Recognize the metal within water,
refine, simmer, and delve deeper into its principles.
Advance and retreat, withdraw and add—nine revolutions,
floating and sinking—
tempering the hidden dragon, *Fu* and *Lin* return.

The marvelous work follows the heart of heaven,
entrusted to the Yellow Dame to pair *Bing* and *Ren*.
Fermented, the brew descends from the mountain’s peak—
drink often,
slowly pluck the stringless zither’s tune.

**Ten**
The eldest son arrives in the west,
the youngest daughter returns to Qian, transforming six yangs.
Now is the time to cultivate the two eights—
guard well—
at nine, you will know the Dao flourishes on its own.

Ox and Dipper deliberate together,
skillfully seizing heaven’s work—marvelous beyond measure.
After the union of *Li* and *Kan*, husband and wife,
do not forget—
only then do you realize the days and months in the pot grow long.

**Eleven**
White snow and yellow sprout,
two essences of purity, one family.
Gather and discern the times of decline and prosperity—
worthy of praise—
the fire’s timing must not err by a hair’s breadth.

Atop the crown, the Three Flowers congeal,
driving the goat cart and deer cart.
Crow and Hare traverse north and south—
intermingling—
from this, the Heavenly River is safely navigated.

**Twelve**
Now the heavenly mechanism is fully revealed—
only fear that people remain obstinately deluded.
The pearl hidden beneath the chin—seize it boldly,
do not delay—
the Dao is within yourself—who else would you ask?

Swiftly cast off the dusty net,
for a hundred years, seventy is rare.
Do not wait until old age, when lead and mercury wane—
how lamentable!
Karmic retribution on the path ahead cannot be deceived.

**Written upon reading the *Cantong Qi***

Qi embraces the Supreme Ultimate,
the Dao establishes the mystic gate.
The sun transmits, the moon moves within it;
the moon holds the sun, concealing its function.
Water rises, floating as mercury within *Li*;
fire descends, sinking as lead within *Kan*.
*Kan* receives *Wu*—the moon’s raven takes flight;
*Li* receives *Ji*—the sun’s hare runs.

Within the furnace of *wu* and *ji*, sun and moon are refined;
*Kan* and *Li* become the elixir, transmuting spirit and soul.
The sun harmonizes the Five Phases, the moon follows the Six Pitches.
The gate opens at *zi* and *wu*, the reckoning turns through *yin* and *shen*.

As *Fu* approaches *Tai*, *Zhuang* nears *Qian*—the six yang revolve leftward;
as *Gou* pursues *Pi*, *Guan*, *Bo*, *Kun*—the six yin turn rightward.
One hundred eighty yang—spring’s radiance in the sun’s palace;
one hundred eighty yin—autumn’s glow in the moon’s hall.
The moon does not shine of itself, but receives its light from the sun;
the sun’s brilliance arises because the moon releases its primal essence.
Mutual chambers, they reveal each other’s spirit,
ever restoring the jade tree’s qi to its root,
never allowing the golden flower’s essence to sever its stem.

The maiden seizes the raven to swallow the jade hare;
the infant drives the hare to absorb the golden crow.
From *Zhen* to *Geng*, *Dui* to *Ding*—*Qian* embraces *Jia* and *Ren*;
from *Xun* to *Xin*, *Gen* to *Bing*—*Kun* conceals *Yi* and *Gui*.
At the waxing crescent, count eight to draw mercury from the sand;
at the waning crescent, count eight to pan gold from the water.
The Azure Dragon is wood—wood engenders fire within;
the White Tiger is metal—metal generates water within.
Seven and eight make fifteen—*Kan* and *Li* unite;
nine and six make fifteen—*Qian* and *Kun* merge.

From *zi* to *si*, first advance the yang fire;
from *wu* to *hai*, then retreat the yin tally.
Seven and eight hold the numbers of young yang and young yin;
nine and six lodge the numbers of old yang and old yin.
Two eights make sixteen—within, the hexagram is complete and dark;
five sixes make thirty—subtly the celestial pivot turns.
*Zhun* and *Meng* ever arise at dawn and dusk,
while *Ji* and *Wei* err not at new and full moon.

In the illusory and indistinct, gold in water remains unsettled;
in the soaring and scattering, wood in fire is hard to gather.
Though metal and wood are sundered by different paths,
water and fire, when harmonized, return to one nature.
Seven returns upward, nine reverts to the origin—
the mystic pearl is formed, the supreme treasure refined.

That which is not spirit is made spirit by spirit;
from shouted breath to settled breath, to breathlessness.
The twenty-four qi embody heaven’s ebb and flow;
the seventy-two seasonal markers follow time’s unfolding and enfolding.

Only by grasping the image and forgetting the words,
not clinging to the text or fixating on the symbol,
can one attain simplicity and ease in enlightenment—
while those who remain deluded find only complexity and growing difficulty.
Through the *Zhouyi*’s images, when carefully examined,
the correspondence is naturally revealed;
only Wei Boyang’s exposition is most detailed—
rightly delve into its subtleties.

*Collected Writings on the Perfection of the Golden Elixir, Volume Thirteen* begins

Purple Void’s Perfected Realized One, Xiao Tingzhi Yuanrui, annotates and explicates *Master Cui’s Mirror for Ingredient Entry*:

Precelestial *qi* and postcelestial *qi*—
the precelestial *qi* is the primordial unity of heaven’s *qi*, infused above the celestial pivot;
the postcelestial *qi* is the primordial unity of earth’s *qi*, infused below the terrestrial pivot.
Should one grasp the turning mechanism of the Dipper’s handle,
then ascent and descent, coming and going, will cycle endlessly,
moving in harmony with heaven’s revolutions.

Master Yuanhe observes: “The human body, in its essence, mirrors heaven and earth.”
One who attains this state remains ever as if intoxicated.
When one masters the Dipper’s handle to regulate the *qi* of yin and yang,
then in a trance of indistinct obscurity—vague, dim, and profound—
body and mind naturally harmonize and expand,
as if entranced or drunk,
the skin suffused with refreshing clarity,
beauty dwelling within.

The sun has its conjunctions, the moon has its conjunctions.
The moon, dependent on the sun for its illumination,
after the dark-new conjunction when the luminaries unite,
the lunar essence generates spirit, transforming yin with yang.
The moon’s dark phase mirrors the year’s end,
its new phase mirrors the year’s beginning.
From the new moon it receives the sun’s celestial tally,
water engendering silver;
by the dark moon, yang *qi* is wholly spent—
then metal and water, these two substances,
naturally enfold one another in mutual embrace.
As the *Cantong Qi* states:
“At the moon’s dark phase, they envelop one another,
concealed within their walled enclosure.”
Exhaust the cyclical earth phases, determine the metal and wood.
The Golden Elixir of Return cannot be wrought without earth;
one must thoroughly investigate true earth.
An ancient song says:
“The Five Phases are present everywhere—
where is true earth to be found?”
Master Ziyang’s verse:
“If *li* and *kan* lack the cyclical earth phases,
though they contain the Four Images, the Elixir will not form.”

*Geng* is the metal of the west;
*jia* is the wood of the east.
Between these two, separated by distance,
wood can only unite through the mediation of the Yellow Dame.
Metal first generates water, wood first generates fire;
when water and fire flourish,
then metal and wood naturally unite.
Master Liu’s *Song of Prior Images*:
“Let *geng* be born, let *jia* be born—
only then is the Dao of birth for *geng* and *jia* made clear.”
The Western Flower Saint Mother declares:
“To birth *jia* and birth *geng* is to become the ancestor of the Great Elixir.”

True earth is the position of *kun*.
Above the Magpie Bridge, below the Magpie Bridge—
here Master Cui again points to the upper and lower two sources.
The Magpie Bridge is the Celestial River.
When one’s practice mirrors the Celestial River’s ceaseless flow,
above and below become inexhaustible.

Heaven responds to the stars, earth responds to the tides.
In heaven, it responds to the stars, like the Dipper’s handle turning in the sky;
on earth, it responds to the tides, like the waxing and waning of the sun and moon.
As the *Song of the Pivotal Axis* says:
“The tide beneath the earth, the moon above the heavens.”

Rouse the *xun* wind, move the *kun* fire.
Rest is wind;
fire cannot flame on its own—
it must rely on wind to fan it.
Master Zhongli’s Elixir Instructions:
“The medicine depends on the *xun* wind.”
Master Apricot Grove’s verse:
“Blowing and breathing rely on the *xun* wind.”
Movement is action.
*Kun* is the southwest, the source where water and fire converge.

Enter the Yellow Chamber, form the supreme treasure.
After the fire tally is activated,
it is guided into the Yellow Chamber,
where the supreme treasure coalesces.
The Yellow Chamber, also called the Yellow Flower or the Mysterious Pass—
a single aperture, the true earth, hence the Yellow Chamber.

Water fears dryness, fire fears cold.
In refining the Golden Elixir,
the entire process depends on the fire’s regulation.
When adding water, it tempers the fire’s aridity;
when moving the fire, one must guard against its chill.
Thus water fears both excess and dryness,
fire fears both aridity and cold.
There are measures and methods—
one must regulate them evenly,
ensuring neither excess nor deficiency.

Deviate by a hair’s breadth, and the Elixir will not form.
When moving the fire, adjust with meticulous care—
the slightest misstep severs heaven from earth.
Master Ziyang’s verse:
“A hair’s breadth of deviation, and the Elixir will not form.”

Lead-dragon ascends, mercury-tiger descends.
Lead is fire, the dragon—
sinking and dwelling below.
Mercury is water, the tiger—
floating and dwelling above.
The Perfected One of Great White’s song:
“When the Five Phases do not proceed in order,
the tiger is born within water;
when the Five Phases are inverted,
the dragon emerges from within fire.”
Through methodical regulation, they naturally ascend and descend.

Drive the two substances, do not let them stray.
When dragon and tiger ascend and descend,
one must grasp and guide them, never allowing them to wander.

Born in *kun*, planted in *qian*—
the medicine is born in the southwest, the domain of *kun*;
born in the earth of *kun*, it is then transplanted to the palace of *qian*.
The principle of the upper and lower two sources is thus made clear.

Only with utmost sincerity does the method follow nature.

True One Master said: Utmost sincerity in refining this medicine is the Way of ascending in broad daylight. Master Yin the True said: Without attaining the proper ground, do not act recklessly. One must conceal, guard, and protect it with care, preserving the celestial and terrestrial mechanism. To steal from Heaven and Earth, to seize the transformations of Creation—all refinement steals the mechanism of Heaven and Earth, seizes the marvel of Creation’s transformations. In application, it accords with the *qian*-*kun* hexagrams of prosperity and decline; in extraction and addition, it mirrors the waxing and waning of the sun and moon.

Set the water clock, divide the two crescents, separate midnight and noon, join yin and yang, connect the dark and new moons, unite dragon and tiger. Follow the great reckoning of Heaven and Earth, invoke the transformative mechanism of yin and yang. The *yin* tally and *yang* fire adhere to the hexagrams’ lines, cycling endlessly, circulating and interchanging without losing their timing. Within a single crucible, the transformations of Creation are manifest, mirroring Heaven and Earth’s movement in generating the myriad things. If the fire-timing is lost, extraction and addition exceed bounds, cold and heat fail to correspond, advance and retreat diverge—then how, within Heaven and Earth, could the myriad things be born? By what means would yin and yang’s *qi* generate dragon and tiger?

Bore through the Five Phases, meet the Eight Trigrams. The five directions take the center as their master; the Five Phases take earth as their master. Occupying the center with the virtue of earth’s dignity, thus water attains earth and conceals its form, fire attains earth and veils its brightness, metal attains earth and enhances its luster, wood attains earth and increases its moisture. Earth has no fixed form, yet it arranges the four images. When the Five Phases gather, the Eight Trigrams naturally converge.

True water, true fire—within *li* there is yin, so the fluid within the heart is true water. Within *kan* there is yang, so the fire within the kidneys is true fire. These are the true water and fire of the body. When water and fire merge, one never ages. The earth’s vapor rises to become mist; the sky’s darkness descends to become dew. Yin and yang unite to form nourishing rain, which brings flourishing to the myriad things. Within the body, yin and yang merge to form true fluid, nourishing the five viscera and six bowels, then returning to the lower *dantian* to congeal as the elixir. Thus, without yin and yang, *qi* does not arise; without fluids, the five viscera and six bowels sicken.

Water flows, fire flames—water is above and thus flows downward; fire dwells below and thus blazes upward. The *Cantong Qi* says: “Water flows but does not blaze upward; fire burns fiercely but does not moisten downward.” This is the meaning. Within the body, it can be verified. True water and true fire exist within the human body, and in the moment of refinement, they can be tested.

This is *xing* and *ming*, not spirit and *qi*. The left is *xing*, which belongs to *li*; the right is *ming*, which belongs to *kan*. The central yin of *kun* enters *qian* to form *li*; the central yang of *qian* enters *kun* to form *kan*. Know that *li* and *kan* are *xing* and *ming*, the essence of spirit and *qi*.

The lead of the water realm is but a single flavor—water is *kan*, lead is metal, also called the metal within water. The *Yunfang Elixir Formula* says: “Lead, lead of the water realm, numinous source of *geng* and *xin*, its chamber belongs to *qian*, it constantly dwells at *kan*’s gate, concealed at *dui*’s edge.” Liu Haichan’s poem says: “To refine the elixir, one must have the lead of the water realm—this single flavor is the root and stem of the returned elixir.”

Return to the root aperture, recover the root of *ming*. Having attained the upper and lower two sources, this is the aperture for returning to the root and recovering *ming*. Pierce the *weilü*, connect the *niwan*. Above, it connects to the *niwan* palace; below, it pierces the *weilü* gate, signifying the ceaseless circulation of a single *qi* between above and below.

True key, true crucible and furnace—*The Treatise on Ascending and Descending* says: “If one can emulate Heaven and Earth’s use of the key, opening lets *qi* exit, closing lets *qi* enter. *Qi*’s exit resembles earth’s *qi* rising; *qi*’s entry resembles heaven’s *qi* descending. With a single *qi* circulating endlessly, one may attain the same longevity as Heaven and Earth.” The upper is called the golden crucible, the lower the jade furnace—yet both are the true transformations of the human body.

Within nonbeing there is being; within being there is nonbeing. *The Golden and Azure Scripture* says: “Being and nonbeing mutually restrain; above, the Azure Dragon resides. The two nonbeings honor the one being—its numinous transformations are wondrous and hard to fathom.” The *Cantong Qi* says: “Above closed is called being; below empty is called nonbeing. Nonbeing serves the above, where the spirit’s virtue resides. These two apertures’ method illustrates how being and nonbeing require each other.”

Entrust the Yellow Dame, match the Maiden of Cinnabar—the Maiden of Cinnabar dwells in the *li* palace; the *kan* youth cannot unite with her without the Yellow Dame’s mediation. The Yellow Dame is *kun* earth. Gently, silently act. When advancing the fire, one should move gently and act silently. Master Xinglin’s poem says: “Quietly conduct the fire-timing, silently move the initial line.” This is the way.

Within a day, the twelve hours; within a year, use the months—one month’s 360 hours correspond to a year. Within a month, take the days—one day’s twelve hours correspond to a month. Within a day, use the hours; within an hour, use the quarters. At this level of subtlety, nothing is not oral instruction. Where intention reaches, all can be done. Within the twelve hours of a day, when a single yang stirs, one may begin. Master Ziyang said: “A moment’s effort contains a year’s seasonal timing.” This is the instantaneous celestial revolution. Ma Ziran’s poem says: “Without distinguishing midnight and noon within the hour, how can one separate *qian* and *kun* within the lines?”

Drink the *daogui*, perceive Heaven’s artistry—flying swords are refined from earth and metal, hence “drinking the *daogui*.” The upper and lower two sources are both true earth. To perceive is to observe. *The Flourishing of the Yin Tally* says: “Observe Heaven’s Way, grasp Heaven’s movement—this is perfection.” Discern the new and full moons, know dusk and dawn.

One may discern the new and full moons within the body. Dusk and dawn correspond to the two hexagrams *Zhun* (Morning Layering) and *Meng* (Evening Darkness). Distinguish floating and sinking, clarify host and guest—lead sinks while silver floats; lead is heavy and lies below, silver is light and rises above. Having discerned floating and sinking, one must clarify host and guest. Master Ziyang’s poem says: *“Though he be host, I remain guest.”* There is no other reason: this is the principle of first ascending, then descending. For union, let there be no separation. Water and fire must always unite; let them not be kept apart.

When gathering the medicine, regulate the fire’s work. At the time of gathering the medicine, all depends on harmonizing the fire’s function. One firm, one yielding; one civil, one martial. Seal the gate at two and eight, secure with six and one. Follow the hexagram’s text, trace the clepsydra’s flow, divide the two crescents, separate midnight and noon—beginning with *Fu* (Return) and ending with *Kun* (Receptive). *The Kinship of the Three* says: *“Lead must be true lead, and fire must be true fire.”* How could one not carefully harmonize them to avoid excess or deficiency?

Receiving qi is auspicious; guard against its turning inauspicious. Master Ziyang’s poem says: *“At first receiving qi, it comes easily; in drawing and adding fire, one must guard against danger.”* At the outset of receiving qi, metal and wood merge, water and fire share a realm—how joyous this seems! Yet when it sheds its form to return to *Kun*, one bathes it to prevent misfortune, guards the city to anticipate peril.

When the fire’s work is complete, do not harm the elixir. When the nine revolutions of fire are fulfilled, cease the talismanic fire. Not knowing when to stop will surely cause the numinous mercury to fly away. Heaven and earth are wondrous, creation is strange—this speaks of their uncanny power, which must not be indulged.

At the initial formation of the embryo, observe one’s natal destiny. When the sacred embryo first forms, look to the moment of receiving qi—this is the natal destiny. At the final shedding of the embryo, observe the four cardinal directions. When the embryo is fully shed, observe the four cardinal palaces, which are the Mysterious Pass.

Proceed in secrecy, and every phrase will resonate. If one practices this with utmost care, every word will prove true. Master Lü’s poem says: *“Reading Cui’s *Mirror of Gathering Medicine* / Makes one’s heart-ground ever clearer.”*

**Interpreting Master Chang’s *Spring in the Qin Garden*:**
The Seven-Return Elixir—fire generates two, completing the number seven. “Return” means ascending from below; “reversion” means descending from above. Some say wood (three) and metal (four) combine to make seven, hence “seven returns”—this explanation is also apt. For metal and wood are the parents of water and fire, the ancestors of the Five Phases, the root of the reverted elixir. To take snivel, spittle, saliva, essence, qi, blood, and fluid as the “seven returns” is utterly mistaken. Master Yunfang’s poem says: *“Seven yin substances— / If one takes these as the seed of the elixir, / How could one ascend to the Jade Capital?”* Master Ziyang’s scripture says: *“What use are these seven yin things?”*

The names of the reverted elixir are many: Great Elixir, Inner Elixir, Jade Flask Elixir, Crimson Snow Elixir, Radiant Cinnabar Elixir, Dragon-Tiger Supreme Medicine, Nine-Turn Spirit Elixir, Cosmic Lord Spirit Elixir, White Snow, Tortoise Essence, Phoenix Blood, Hare Marrow, Raven Liver, Primordial Qi of Heaven and Earth. Yet all are but the union of true lead and true mercury—never the coarse lead, mercury, minerals, plants, or material medicines. Mercury is the nine-turn true mercury; lead is the seven-return true lead. This single flavor is the true qi of heaven and earth, the purest essence of sun and moon. Externally, it mirrors the images of *Qian* and *Kun*; internally, it accords with the workings of creation. It gives life and brings death, becomes tiger and dragon, harbors affection and duty to act as husband and wife, binds ancestors and descendants to be called mother and child.

Once these two flavors are understood, their natures must be known. Through the matchmaker, male and female harmonize; through the mother, children and grandchildren grow. The sages’ deepest secret is profoundly mysterious—those who cultivate the elixir should seek it within themselves.

First, one must refine the self and await the time. The Dao is not far from man; the common people use it daily yet do not know it. Refining the self is the way of refining the form. It is nothing less than splitting open primordial chaos, cleaving apart the undifferentiated, gathering the essence of the True One, embracing the radiance of the primordial, to lay the foundation of the elixir. One cannot use heterogenous elements for creation. Thus *The Kinship of the Three* says: *“Swallows and sparrows do not give birth to phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses. / Of the same kind, transformation comes easily; of different species, skill is hard to apply.”*

The Master of Golden Flower Grotto answered the Mount Taishi Hermit: *“Accumulate the yang hun, dissolve the yin po, and use the yang soldiers to repel the yin bandits. / The eight trigrams interact, the Five Phases overcome one another, returning to the root and recovering destiny—thus the elixir blazes forth. / Refine the form with essence, not with mere cinnabar or stone.”* Some take “refining the self” to mean “refining earth”—this explanation is also apt, for the medicine arises in the southwest, the region of *Kun*.

The essential is to know the time. If one misses the time, how can heaven and earth rely on seasonal nodes to generate the radiance of yin and yang? How can they give birth to dragon and tiger? The moments before and after the crescent moon are the transformations within the time; the union of *Kan* and *Li* is the work within the clepsydra’s flow. At this level of subtlety, nothing is not oral instruction.

When the first yang stirs, the midnight clepsydra runs long. The cosmos is in your hands; the myriad transformations are in your body. The Master of Piling said: *“To refine the elixir, one need not seek the winter solstice— / Within the body, a yang naturally arises. / Within the time, there is the work of time; within the clepsydra’s flow, there is the work of the clepsydra.”*

The lead crucible is warm, its light piercing the curtain. The lead crucible is the crucible for creating lead. “Warm” refers to the fire’s strength—it must not be deficient, for only through gentle nurturing can the elixir form. The Master of Piling said: *“The golden crucible always holds warm water and fire; / The jade furnace must not be allowed to grow cold.”* The curtain refers to the eyes. Master Yunfang has the line: *“Leisurely lowering the curtain, silently observing.”* Where the work is applied, the spirit’s radiance shines brilliantly, penetrating the curtain.

The workings of creation race in contest, dragon and tiger meet in union.

Now, the contest of creation’s workings: when the dragon intones, clouds arise; when the tiger roars, winds stir. Thus, the water-tiger seizes the fire-dragon, and they intertwine in union. *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *“The lead-dragon ascends, the mercury-tiger descends; / Drive the two substances—do not let them flee.”* Should the firing be mistimed, dragon and tiger fail to unite, and lead and mercury scatter.

Master Ziyang’s verse reads:
*“The white tiger of Western Mountain rages wild, / The azure dragon of Eastern Sea cannot be withstood. / Seized in both hands to wrestle unto death, / They fuse into a mass of purple-golden frost.”*
To seize them in both hands is but to ensure their union, that they may congeal into treasure.

The firing work follows the Dipper’s perilous stars.

Now, fire is the true essence of the Great Yang, named yet formless. Thus *The Kinship of the Three* says: *“Having obtained true lead, one still lacks true fire.”* How lightly could this be discussed? For fire arises within water—why? Kan belongs to water, and within Kan lies true yang, which is true fire. When dragon and tiger unite, metal and wood merge, then true fire flames within.

The firing work has its hardness and softness, civil and martial, weights and measures, rules and bounds. The double-eight seals the gate; the six-one secures the cauldron. Following the hexagrams’ lines, tracing the clepsydra’s flow, resolving *Zhun* and *Meng*, discerning *Pi* and *Tai*, dividing the crescents, distinguishing dark and new moons—from *Fu*’s beginning to *Kun*’s end, from dawn’s rise to dusk’s close—then yin and yang unfold and coil, metal and mercury harmonize.

Yet if the firing timing errs, rains and droughts fall out of season: scorching heat in deep winter, bitter frost in high summer. The golden palace’s cinnabar and mercury fall into discord; the jade crucible breeds locusts in swarms. The metal-mother and wood-dragon seethe and boil; the Kan-man and Li-woman flee in haste. All this stems from misapplied firing, and the numinous mercury takes flight.

As it is said:
*“The slightest misalignment invites regret and loss; / A hair’s breadth of error, and the elixir fails to form.”*
How could one not proceed with utmost care?

When the Dipper aligns with *Niu* and *Dou*, it is the time to apply effort. At the winding river’s rise, the moon’s radiance gleams bright, and a crow takes flight—this is the small intestine, coiled ninefold in twelve bends, called the Winding River. The moon signifies the elixir’s function, its flawless, crystalline coldness marking it as the supreme treasure. The crow in flight embodies yin containing yang. As Liu Haichan’s verse says: *"How oft it perches in the cassia boughs,"* and again: *"The crow flies, the hare unstartled."* An ancient poem echoes: *"A crow flies into the hare’s palace,"* all conveying this meaning. At that moment, one drinks the *daogui* oneself. When the work of union begins, one acts—gathering from the earthen crucible and imbibing it. Thus *The Mirror of Entering the Elixir* states: *"Drink the daogui, know the earthen crucible—only then may one speak of the daogui’s subtlety."* And who would believe a child is nurtured from nothing? The Way of the Returned Elixir is nothing giving birth to something: gradually gathering, gradually refining, coalescing into the sacred embryo, form arising from formlessness, nurturing the infant. As Master Zi Qing’s poem says: *"How many times the world’s affairs make one laugh— / A man, too, may conceive a child. / His own essence and blood unite in congress; / Within his body, husband and wife are wondrous indeed."*

Discern the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source. *The Scripture of Clarity and Stillness* states: *"Heaven is clear, earth is turbid; man is clear, woman is turbid."* Clarity is the source of turbidity—nothing more, for yang is clear and yin is turbid. The light and clear float above: true mercury. The heavy and turbid sink below: true lead. These two serve distinct purposes—how could one not distinguish the Way of clarity and turbidity, ascent and descent?

Wood and metal stand apart. Wood dwells in the east, *jia-yi*, manifesting as the Azure Dragon, corresponding to the *Zhen* trigram. It is Qian’s eldest son, fire’s mother, metal’s wife—the green-robed maiden, the blue-eyed barbarian child, the Azure Dragon of the Eastern Sea, the essence of wood. Metal resides in the west, *geng-xin*, manifesting as the White Tiger, corresponding to the *Dui* trigram. It is Kun’s youngest daughter, water’s mother, wood’s husband—the white-garbed gentleman, the white-haired elder, the White Tiger of the Western Mountains, the essence of metal. Separated by *mao* and *you*, they cannot meet without the matchmaker’s aid. As Zi Yang says: *"Wood and metal, sundered, cannot unite without cause; / They must rely on the matchmaker’s guidance."* Then wood gives birth to fire, metal to water; water and fire share a realm, and metal and wood merge. Without a teacher’s guidance, this remains obscure.

The great elixir of golden cinnabar has been passed down once in ten thousand kalpas. The jade bamboo’s sacred scrolls leave nine of ten scholars lost; the sage’s words are transmitted mouth to mouth, heart to heart across generations. Without heart-to-heart transmission and oral instruction, even the talents of the Three Heroes or the wisdom of the Ten Sages, no matter how many ways they ponder, will never begin the work or coalesce the sacred embryo. As the saying goes: *"Though your wisdom surpass Yan and Min, / Without a wise teacher, do not guess in vain. / For the golden elixir has no oral formula— / Where then will you form the numinous embryo?"* Liu Haichan’s verse declares: *"This Way is utterly manifest, / Yet how can one grasp it through wild conjecture?"* The Way of the Golden Elixir is truly difficult to know without a true teacher.

The Dao’s essentials are profound and subtle, its celestial mechanisms deep and distant. The Great Dao is formless, giving birth to heaven and earth. The Great Dao is passionless, moving the sun and moon. The Great Dao is nameless, nurturing the ten thousand things. I know not its name—reluctantly, I call it the Dao. Vast and obscure, within it lies essence; dim and indistinct, within it lies substance. Invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, untouchable to grasp—from nothing, something arises. Its celestial mechanisms are deep and distant, its mysteries unfathomable. *The Scripture of the Hidden Correspondence* says: *"Heaven harbors five thieves; to see them is to flourish. / To know and cultivate them is to be called a sage."* Without penetrating insight into yin and yang, deep understanding of creation’s workings, how could one cleave open the primordial chaos, gather the roots of heaven and earth’s parents as the foundation of the elixir; rend the vast expanse, extract the pure essence of yin and yang as the substance of the great elixir? Boring through the five phases, harmonizing the four images, the three flowers gather at the crown, ensuring the primal qi does not dim; the five qi ascend to the origin, ensuring the yang soul does not stray. Roaming freely in the boundless dark, traversing the indistinct and vague, one moves in and out, shifts and unites spirit and yang. When the work is complete and merit fulfilled, one attains the rank of celestial immortal.

Yet the Way of the Golden Liquor’s Returned Elixir has but one gate—how could it be spoken of in the same breath as lesser, peripheral methods? Begin swiftly, for even now it may be too late. A thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises say nothing of the initial work—only oral formulas transmit it. At the outset, one wields the key to heaven and earth’s treasury, gathers the *daogui* of Kan and Li, draws the body’s spirits into the central palace of the celestial valley. Swallowing and nurturing them, the spirits return to their root—this is called *"returning the wind."* Merging and sealing the root’s source, this is the Way of guarding the true one. *The Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger* states: *"The spirit-chamber’s upper and lower crucibles— / Transformation lies in your hands."* Thus the True Unity Master discusses the green serpent’s sword; the Old Man of Western Shu grasps the golden hammer’s subtlety; Master Lü likens it to a firebrand; the Empty Horn of Qingcheng says a sword is not the Way. All these exhaust the traces, dissect the primordial root—without beginning the work, to merely discuss the golden elixir is to achieve nothing. An ancient song says: *"When the sage grasps creation’s intent, / Hand-seizing sun and moon, he sets them in the furnace."* *The Scripture of the Hidden Correspondence* declares: *"The cosmos lies in your hands, / The ten thousand transformations arise in your body."* To study without encountering a teacher is to encounter no one; to encounter one without diligence is to remain a lesser ghost. Laozi said: *"The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it."* The immortal’s Way can only be cultivated by humans. As the ancients said: *"Immortals are but mortals made."*

Know this: the wheel of rebirth turns endlessly, and karmic retribution is inescapable. Wealth, honor, and glory are but fleeting schemes—begin your practice swiftly, for even now you may fear it is too late.

The path to Penglai
rests on three thousand deeds fulfilled,
alone you tread the clouds to return.

The three isles of Penglai are the immortal mountains upon the sea. Within the human body, too, there are three isles of Penglai: the crown is the Upper Isle, the heart the Middle Isle, and the kidneys the Lower Isle. Master Zi Qing’s poem says: *"Within the human body lies a Penglai of its own."* The three thousand meritorious deeds are the count of nine years embracing the One. When nine years of practice are complete, one may divide form and scatter radiance, or emerge from being and enter non-being, or ascend lightly on distant journeys—hidden or manifest, beyond all reckoning. Some exchange their bones to ascend as immortals, roaming the Isles of Penglai; others are summoned by the Great One, dwelling in the Central Elixir, each according to the depth of their merit and practice.

*The Broken Headband* says:
*"When nine years of practice are complete,
Form remains in the world, unaware of spring.
Suddenly the Heavenly Gate shatters at the crown,
The perfected one appears with great spiritual power—
From this moment, celestial immortals may offer their congratulations."*

*The Kinship of the Three* says:
*"When the Dao is accomplished and virtue perfected,
One conceals oneself awaiting the appointed time.
Summoned by the Great One,
You move to dwell in the Central Elixir.
When merit is fulfilled and ascension achieved,
You receive the chart and are recorded."*

Immortal Peng annotates:
*"The Perfected Lord of the Great One presides over inner cultivation. When mortals first attain the Dao, their names are engraved on the golden tablets of this elixir. Receiving the chart and being recorded, they thereby achieve ascension."*

*Collected Writings on the Great Achievement of the Golden Elixir, Volume Thirteen* concludes.
