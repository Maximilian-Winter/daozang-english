**Verses on the Fire Phases of the Golden Elixir**

Boring through the heavens and earth, the transformations arise;
Hands knead sun and moon, refining them into ash.
The Golden Lord speaks not, the Mysterious Maiden perishes;
The Yellow Dame, ageless, still harbors the embryo.

The lead crucible slowly nurtures the true golden liquid;
The earthen cauldron first dries the living mercury.
The mercury-heart refines the spirit, the Crimson Dragon’s nature;
The lead-body congeals the qi, the White Tiger’s life.

Within and without, not a trace of yin remains;
Amidst the radiance of ten thousand images, the Jade Clarity realm.

**Verses on the Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir**

The dragon soars from the Li palace,
The tiger leaps in the Kan palace.
Metal and wood intermingle,
Water and fire strike and clash.

Punishment and virtue, guest and host;
Floating and sinking, clear and turbid.
Three hundred days of gestation,
Two times eight taels of medicine.

Metal, when joined with earth, is born;
Wood, when joined with earth, flourishes.
Water, when joined with earth, is stilled;
Fire, when joined with earth, is quelled.

White snow in the void,
The yellow sprout of perfect enlightenment.
The hare and crow as husband and wife,
The tortoise and serpent as root and calyx.

Cinnabar remains unmoved,
Mercury finds no attachment.
The lead tripod is pure yang,
The purple clouds and celestial crane.

In hue like a red tangerine.

Departing from all extremes,
Within the gourd lies heaven.
Mysterious, yet again mysterious,
Entering the gate of all wonders.

Thirty Paired Principles in the *Three Ways of Elixir Refinement*:
Clear and turbid, waxing and waning,
Decline and prosperity, existence and annihilation,
Presence and absence, fortune and misfortune,
Regret and shame, generation and restriction,
Punishment and virtue, movement and stillness,
Advance and retreat, dissolution and growth,
Guest and host, sinking and floating,
Ascent and descent, civil and martial,
Old and tender, firm and yielding,
Separation and union, gathering and dispersal,
Coming and going, above and below,
Female and male, black and white,
Defense and assault, life and death,
Instant and recurrence, depth and shallowness,
Withdrawal and replenishment, cold and heat.

Seven Mirrors in the *Three Ways of Elixir Refinement*:
**Flowery Pond** – The heart-source and nature-sea are called the Flowery Pond.
**Divine Water** – Nature is like water, thus called Divine Water.
**Yellow Sprout** – The heart-ground unfolds its leaves, thus called the Yellow Sprout.
**White Snow** – The empty chamber generates whiteness, thus called White Snow.
**River Chariot** – Qi circulates in one cycle, thus called the River Chariot.
**Xun Wind** – Xun means compliance, thus called Xun Wind.
The Golden Elixir is pure, luminous, all-pervading, and vast.

Nineteen Secrets in the *Three Ways of Elixir Refinement*:
1. **Gathering the Medicine** – Collect body and mind, gather and conceal spirit and qi.
2. **Coagulating the Elixir** – Congeal qi and concentrate, thoughts unmoving.
3. **Refining the Jade Talisman** – Preserve spirit with the jade tally, refine form with golden liquid.
4. **Sealing Firmly** – Forget form and extinguish thoughts, this is called *sealing firmly*.
5. **Martial Fire** – Stir spirit vigorously, drive away stray thoughts.
6. **Civil Fire** – Focus qi to attain softness, embrace light in silence, warmth unbroken, continuity as if present.
7. **Bathing** – Wash the heart and purify thoughts, this is called *bathing*.
8. **Cinnabar** – Presence and absence interpenetrate, concealment and manifestation align.
9. **Passing the Barrier** – The fruit ripens on the branch, the child in the womb—how could they differ?
10. **Dividing the Embryo** – The hen broods the egg, listening constantly; the cicada, once formed, sheds its shell.
11. **Nurturing** – Know the white yet guard the black, spirit and clarity come of themselves.
12. **Guarding Against Danger** – A single thought strays, and the fire-timing is lost.
13. **Effort** – Gather at dawn, refine at dusk; temper by day, simmer by hour.
14. **Union** – Thoughts continue unbroken, merging into one.
15. **Great Return** – Facing scenes without mind, day and night as one.
16. **Sacred Embryo** – Preserve spirit within, conceal qi inside.
17. **Nine Revolutions** – When the fire-timing is complete, the infant appears of itself.
18. **Changing the Tripod** – The child begets grandchildren, a thousand, ten thousand, boundless transformations.
19. **Supreme Ultimate** – Form and spirit both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth.

**Shortcut to the Golden Elixir**

The Golden Elixir is refined from inner lead and outer mercury—it is not of metals, stones, herbs, or trees. Through seven returns and nine reversions, does it become the medicine of transformation and ascension?

Within the red appears the yellow; knowing the white, one guards the qi—these are the lead and mercury of the Golden Elixir. The wind atop Mount Hua, the waves beneath the Fusang Sea—these are the Dragon and Tiger of the Golden Elixir. The luan and phoenix within the spirit-chamber, the clouds and rain within the elixir-house—these are the husband and wife of the Golden Elixir. The sun’s essence leaking celestial marrow, the moon’s spirit moving earthly fat—these are the Crow and Hare of the Golden Elixir. The circulation of the two qi, the revolving of the primordial unity—these are the Tortoise and Serpent of the Golden Elixir. The civil fire for gentle nurturing, the martial fire for forging refinement—these are the fire-timing of the Golden Elixir.

As for the bathing in the Dao of the Elixir: the water of Kun, the water of Kan. The blowing and breathing in the Dao of the Elixir: the wind of Xun, the wind of Li.

Alas, the wonders of the Golden Elixir are not transmitted! Drawing and adding according to the sun and moon, waxing and waning in imitation of heaven and earth, punishment and virtue modeled on Mao and You, conjunctions uniting metal and wood. Moreover, the clarity or turbidity of the water source, the slowness or swiftness of the fire-timing, the maturity or tenderness of the medicinal materials, the beginning and end of the union, the transformations of the embryonic immortal—these too must be known.

Knowing these, one reads *The Pearl and Jade of the Immortals* and suddenly awakens, as if released, like orchids in the spring breeze, like parasol trees in the first autumn rain, like night snow in the pine forest, like evening sunlight on the bamboo path—such is the flavor of the Golden Elixir. Serene as white clouds in the spring sky, bright as the pale moon in the autumn pool, obscure as an infant yet unborn, dim as an elder on the verge of senility—such is the attainment of the Golden Elixir.

Thus is the Golden Elixir cultivated, thus are the medicinal substances gathered, thus are water and fire employed, thus does the Dao of the Elixir unite and thus is it accomplished.

*The Pearl and Jade of the Immortals*—a work unparalleled in ancient or modern times. Who was Hu Taixian? A man who abandoned Confucianism and transcended the common world, yet his immortality remains unverified. His intent was thus—he was a man of old.

**On the Golden Elixir**

I have heard that before the Supreme Ultimate divided, all was a chaotic void, undifferentiated in clarity or turbidity, formless as a hen’s egg. Once the primordial qi split, the Two Modes arose. Thus, the pure and numinous qi floated to become heaven, the heavy and turbid qi descended to become earth, and the harmonious qi congealed to become humanity. The Three Powers were established, and the myriad things were born.

The sages of antiquity looked up to observe the patterns of heaven, looked down to examine the principles of earth, and inwardly grasped the norms of human relations. Thus, Fuxi first drew the Eight Trigrams to exhaustively investigate the forms of heaven and earth and illuminate the source and flow of creation. He paired Qian and Kun with the movement and stillness of heaven and earth, aligned Kan and Li with the circulation of the sun and moon. The five viscera were divided into the five phases, corresponding above to the five stars in their celestial procession and inwardly clarifying the mutual restraint of the five qi.

Thus, the liver stores the ethereal soul, dwelling in the east, and is called the Azure Dragon; the lungs store the corporeal soul, dwelling in the west, and are named the White Tiger; the heart stores the spirit, dwelling in the south, and is titled the Vermilion Bird; the kidneys store the essence, dwelling in the north, and are likened to the Dark Warrior; the spleen stores the will, dwelling in the center, and is honored as the virtue of earth.

Therefore, water, when met with earth, conceals its form; fire, when met with earth, veils its brightness; metal, when met with earth, enhances its luster; wood, when met with earth, overflows with moisture. Thus, the Dragon and Tiger unite in the jade crucible, water and fire achieve balance in the golden tripod. The true essence soars behind the elbow, the river chariot revolves in the Jade Capital, the mysterious pearl descends in the Flowery Pond, the yellow sprout grows in the Numinous Valley. The Three Corpses flee, the Six Bandits escape, the yang spirit gathers to form an immortal, and the golden mercury coalesces into treasure. Only then can one transcend the mundane and enter sainthood, attaining an age equal to heaven.

I have seen Master Bai compile alchemical texts, illustrating inner images of creation, distinguishing the five phases, arranging the Eight Trigrams, pointing out the elixir’s cauldron, clarifying the fire-timing, the ascent and descent of yin and yang, the galloping of Dragon and Tiger, the unfolding of phenomena, all rendered into diagrams to guide those who love the Dao. With a single glance, all becomes clear and doubt vanishes, allowing one to enter by a smooth path. If one follows the diagrams in practice, what confusion could remain?

**Treatise on Cultivating the True**

It has often been said that the Great Dao is subtle and obscure, difficult for people to comprehend. Therefore, the sages concealed its profound principles within the classics, hid them among the myriad things, and employed parables and images—all to deliver the deluded.

In former times, the *Baopuzi* stated: "Water with a source flows far; trees with roots grow lush; houses with foundations stand firm; and those who preserve their essence live long." The *Ninefold Elixir Classic* says: "What one may preserve is life; what is lamentable is the body; what may be stored is qi; and what is most precious is essence." The *Supreme Mysterious Mirror* states: "Pure yang ascending is called qi; pure yin descending is called fluid. When qi and fluid merge within the bone marrow, it is called marrow. When qi and marrow unite beyond the bladder, it is called essence. When heart-qi resides in the liver and liver-essence is unstable, the eyes grow dim and lose their luster. When heart-qi resides in the lungs and lung-essence is weak, the flesh withers. When heart-qi resides in the kidneys and kidney-essence is unstable, spirit and qi diminish. When heart-qi resides in the spleen and spleen-essence is unsteady, teeth and hair loosen and fall. Among the five viscera, the kidneys govern essence, and the heart is the abode of qi. True essence resides in the kidneys, while surplus essence naturally returns to the lower elixir field; true qi resides in the heart, while surplus qi naturally returns to the primordial palace. Thus, a person’s qi measures eight hundred and ten *zhang*, corresponding to the eighty-one yang numbers of nine nines. Beyond this, essence scatters, primordial qi dissipates, illness arises, and death follows.

Moreover, Guangchengzi transmitted the Dao to the Yellow Emperor, teaching the art of longevity: "In all going out and coming in, do not depart from the Mysterious Female; in all movement and stillness, abide only in the Valley Spirit. In the profound and obscure, there is essence; in the vague and indistinct, there is substance. Know the white, guard the black, and you may attain long life." I have also observed Master Xujing’s words: "The Great Dao is not distant—it lies within the body. Though things are empty, nature is not. If nature remains unobstructed, harmonious qi abides; when qi returns to the primordial sea, life knows no end. To keep the spirit within the body, do not cling to a single thing in the numinous terrace. If things linger in the heart, the spirit grows clouded, essence scatters, and sinews and bones weaken."

The Dao is easy to know yet hard to encounter; easy to encounter yet hard to perfect. Recently, I sought teachers and friends, inquiring into the great medicine of the golden elixir and the methods of fire-timing, withdrawal, and addition. Yet none spoke of the foundational work. Without a path to enter, one remains lost. Now, beholding Master Bai of Hainan’s *Diagrams of Cultivating the True and Nurturing Life*, which employs images to reveal the mysteries of the Great Dao, I hope that those of like aspiration may follow these diagrams in practice—this is truly the swiftest path. Let none neglect this.

**Colophon to the *Miscellaneous Writings on Pointing to the Mysterious*, Volume One of the *Ten Books on Cultivating the True***

**Preface to the *Returning to the Source***

By Shi Tai of Apricot Grove, the Perfected One

Tai has long revered the true teaching, traversed sacred sites, and sought transmission of the orthodox method. With a heart set on benefiting the world, he focused solely on the Three Treasures, prizing longevity above all. For the path to immortality is easily walked, yet people make it difficult; shedding the dust is not hard, yet people find it so. How lamentable!

As the ancients said: "Deluded clouds veil the moon of wisdom; karmic winds stir the sea of stillness." In former years, while serving in the postal relay, I encountered my late teacher, Master Zhang Ziyang. His concise words—no more than half a phrase—yielded verification in but a moment. Knowing that immortality could be learned, I rejoiced inwardly. When the golden liquid congealed and the sacred embryo formed, Tai composed the *Returning to the Source*, eighty-one chapters of five-character quatrains, to instruct later learners. Awaken early to the true root—do not wait until old age, when lead is exhausted and mercury scarce. Urgently reflect, seek a teacher, and inquire into the cultivation of the golden elixir. Together, may we attain the fruit of immortality, transform, and ascend in flight. This is my deepest wish.

The eighty-one chapters of *Returning to the Source* correspond to the pure yang number.

---

1.
Lead and mercury form the true body,
Yin and yang supply the Great Primal.
Simply know to practice the two eights—
Then you may refine the golden elixir.

2.
Mercury is the marrow of the Green Dragon,
Lead is the fat of the White Tiger.
Return them to the cauldron—
Gather them, knowing the proper time.

3.
The Maiden rides the lead tiger,
The Metal Lord mounts the mercury dragon.
Illumine the correct decree—
Refine until the furnace glows red.

4.
The snake-soul seizes the dragon’s marrow,
The turtle-spirit restrains the tiger’s essence.
Within the divine water,
A jade mushroom blooms.

5.
White snow flies in the jasper garden,
Yellow sprouts burgeon in the jade park.
Know the crescent moon—
Where to refine the red lead?

6.
The medicinal materials open the primordial chaos,
The fire-timing smelts the vast expanse.
The embryo immortal transforms—
Only then is the ninefold turning known.

7.
Where the dragon conceals its pearl,
When the hen broods her egg—
Lead and mercury unite,
Just then may one partake of the knife-round.

8.
Bathing relies on the water of Kun,
Breathing depends on the wind of Xun.
With nothing to do,
Abide alone in the Grand Tenuity Palace.

9.
Seek the Maiden of Li in the Purple Court,
Pair the Man of Kan with the Vermilion Mound.
Where the Yellow Dame serves as matchmaker,
The Supreme Ultimate naturally enfolds the Three.

10.
The Qian horse gallops to the golden gate,
The Kun ox enters the wooden palace.
Who is the general that startles the maiden,
Marrying her off to the Metal Elder?

11.
The startled maiden is just sixteen,
The Metal Elder is precisely twenty-seven.
In the bridal chamber, auspicious qi arises—
Their joyous union bears a firstborn son.

12.
Last night by the western riverbank,
The toad’s light shone on the azure waves.
Gathered and brought to the jade chamber,
Within the crucible, it refines itself.

13.
Li and Kan do not copulate—
Qian and Kun transform of themselves.
One who understands this principle
Points and fills the Yellow Court.

14.
The Elixir Valley births divine water,
The Yellow Court holds the great granary.
No longer hungering or thirsting,
One enters the immortal realm.

15.
The horse of intent returns to the spirit chamber,
The ape of the heart guards the grotto room.
Spirit, essence, soul, and will—
All transform into purple gold frost.

16.

One aperture, the Mysterious Pass,
Three barriers at the vital crossroads.
With sudden, gentle movement,
Divine water flows of itself.

17.
The po is not restrained by the heart,
Nor is the hun bound by intent.
Only spirit and qi remain—
In an instant, the Mysterious Pearl congeals.

18.
The oral instructions are few,
The Elixir’s refinement takes but a moment.
Gently regulate the fire’s timing,
In ten months, the infant is born.

19.
At first, the couple’s joyful union,
With passing years, their affection deepens.
In the bridal chamber where they meet,
Every day is spring’s breeze.

20.
Sudden rain on paper butterflies,
A great furnace’s jade peony.
At midnight, the red sun blazes,
In the sixth month, pristine frost chills.

21.
When union is complete,
The jade crucible emits azure smoke.

22.
Break open the Mysterious Origin’s aperture,
Pierce through the Gate of Chaos.
Simply know how to refine water and fire,
Let tiger and dragon coil freely.

23.
Fire within the sea of Śakradeva,
Waves upon Kunlun’s peak.
Who can master their operation?
The great key lies with the Yellow Dame.

24.
The medicine is drawn from primordial qi,
The fire seeks the essence of the Great Simplicity.
One who knows how to gather medicine and fire
Will surely witness the Elixir’s completion.

25.
How is primordial qi ingested?
True essence need not be moved.
True essence and primordial qi—
These are the Great Elixir’s foundation.

26.
Confucians clarify illusory principles,
Buddhists strike at stubborn emptiness.
Unacquainted with the immortal arts,
The Golden Elixir’s work is instantaneous.

27.
Mercury in the crescent-moon furnace,
Lead within the cinnabar crucible.
Tortoise and serpent, one true qi—
Their offspring is born of the prior heaven.

28.
From new moon to full, from crescent to dark,
Withdraw and add, emulating wax and wane.
Without knowing true creation,
What substance is true lead?

29.
Qi is life within form,
The heart is spirit within nature.
One who knows the cavity of spirit and qi
Is precisely the one who attains immortality.

30.
Wood’s marrow refines the golden crucible,
Spring flows into the jade furnace.
Who will devote three hundred days
To slowly apply their effort?

31.
Jade liquid nourishes the spirit chamber,
The golden embryo forms at the qi’s pivot.
Seek only the medicine within the body,
No need to pore over alchemical texts.

32.
The jade crucible refines lead’s liquid,
The golden furnace nurtures mercury’s essence.
Nine returns become nine revolutions,
Gentle nurturing follows the cycle of stars.

33.
The fire jujube has no pit,
The intertwined pear bears no core.
All day without fire’s timing,
Divine water irrigates the golden blossom.

34.
To refine primordial qi,
First dry the living mercury.
When the sacred embryo takes form,
Breaking through the crown, thunder roars.

35.
Refining qi is labor in vain,
Preserving spirit is effort wasted.
How could one know the Elixir’s wondrous secret?
All day long, one feasts on true emptiness.

36.
Qi is not produced by the kidneys,
Spirit does not dwell in the heart.
Qi and spirit are elusive—
They transform into a mass of gold.

37.
One aperture is called the Mysterious Female,
Within it, qi and spirit reside.
Who knows this aperture?
Seek no further—do not search outside for truth.

38.
The spleen and stomach are not the spirit chamber,
The bladder is but the kidneys’ surplus.
Do not cling to these—
This is not the Elixir’s pivot.

39.
A thousand verses on inner visions,
A goblet of Central Yellow wine.
Carefree, unburdened by things,
Beyond the body lies the cosmos.

40.
Crow and hare refine each other,
Tortoise and serpent coil naturally.
They transform into a single Elixir grain,
Gently nurtured into an embryonic immortal.

41.
All things undergo birth and death,
The primordial spirit dies and revives.
When the embryo returns to qi,
The Dao of the Elixir naturally achieves completion.

42.
Where spirit and qi return to their root,
When body and mind revert to their mandate—
Such is the true aperture,
Few indeed comprehend it.

43.
Within the body lies the Mysterious Female,
Within the heart, no dust or stain.
Who can recognize this?
One aperture contains all truth.

44.
Li and Kan are true dragon and tiger,
Qian and Kun are proper horse and ox.
Every person possesses them fully—
Why then do so few know to cultivate?

45.
Hun and po govern the heart,
Spirit and essence are enveloped by intent.
Steadily regulate the fire’s timing,
Silently move the initial line.

46.
Below the heart, above the kidneys,
West of the liver, left of the lungs.
Neither intestines nor stomach,
A single qi flows freely.

47.
The wondrous function is not tied to intent,
The true mechanism requires no timing.
Who can know this aperture?
Do not simply indulge in non-action.

48.
There is something, yet not nothing,
Non-action unites with action.
The power of transformation lies in your hands—
Crow and hare congeal golden fat.

49.
The tiger roars on the western mountain,
The dragon intones east of the northern sea.
Capture them—wild battle is required,
Entrust them to the palace of Gen and Kun.

50.
Fu and Shen govern brightness and darkness,
Zhun and Meng align with dawn and dusk.
The Elixir furnace congeals white snow,
Nowhere to find the heart’s ape.

51.
Black mercury sprouts yellow leaves,
Red lead blooms purple flowers.
Further regulate the fire’s timing,
Within the crucible, cinnabar forms.

52.
Wood’s essence must guard against the hare,
Metal’s essence must shun the rooster.
Withdraw and add—this is bathing,
Precisely when the moon is full.

53.
When the wind first stirs myriad sounds,
When the moon first rounds a thousand peaks—
Hasten to issue the true command,
Then you may circulate the Microcosmic Orbit.

54.
Distinguish the medicine’s age and tenderness,
Apply fire’s timing with withdrawal and addition.
When the Elixir’s light arises,
The cold toad’s rays pierce the jade curtain.

55.
The clam’s belly once split for its pearl,
The hen’s nest yields eggs with ease.
Life has its substance—
Spirit and qi naturally contend.

56.
Spirit and qi are not parent and child,
Body and mind are not husband and wife.
Align with heaven’s mechanism—
Who knows where the Elixir congeals?

57.
Where the Elixir’s head first forms,
When the medicine has already congealed—
In their fierce battle,
Even the sovereign remains unaware.

58.
Side doors and minor methods,
Strange arts and idle words—
The Elixir’s secret
Has no second path.

59.
Noble and base, high and low,
Husband and wife, brothers—
If they have the destiny,
All may study the Elixir’s classic.

60.
A broken house is easily repaired,
A withered medicine is not hard to revive.
The method of return—
Gold and treasure accumulate like mountains.

61.
Hun and po form the three natures,
Spirit and essence harmonize the five phases.
Within them, the four images divide,
Gathering to form the embryo’s essence.

62.

With resolve seek lead and mercury,
With stillness seek earth and gold.
Only then know the true single aperture—
Who can fathom this profound depth?

63.
Creation has no root or stem,
Yin and yang possess their origin.
These true wonders—
Even father and son cannot transmit them.

64.
Retain mercury in the golden crucible,
Guide lead into the jade pool.
Host and guest know no left or right,
Only recognize the infant.

65.
The Yellow Dame’s twin breasts are fair,
Elder Ding’s heart is kind.
In nurturing, no other guard is needed—
Within nothingness, the child is reared.

66.
Crimson towers see the green phoenix soar,
The cinnabar field nurtures the royal toad.
Within the gourd, heaven knows no night—
White snow falls, delicate and fine.

67.
When zither and lute harmonize,
The legacy is complete.
No need to tend the fire’s timing—
Lest the infant be harmed.

68.
The eldest son enters *dui*,
The youngest daughter returns to *qian*.
The *xun* palace and earth’s position—
The gates and locks complete the celestial cycle.

69.
At the moments before and after the crescent,
When the moon waxes full or wanes.
Withdraw and replenish, mirroring punishment and virtue—
Bathe according to its waxing and waning.

70.
Old mercury, three pounds of white,
True lead, a single point of red.
Seize the marrow of heaven and earth—
In a moment’s union.

71.
Where fire and timing reach the mysterious,
Who through the ages has dared transmit it?
Before knowing how to gather the medicine,
Do not ask of the celestial cycle.

72.
Clouds scatter the crabapple moon,
Spring deepens with willow winds.
Who understands this meaning?
Raising one’s gaze to empty space.

73.
Among men, no worldly burdens,
In heaven, there are immortal steps.
Already knowing how to ride the clouds,
Together they come with the white crane.

74.
The field of the heart bears no weeds,
The land of nature is free of dust.
In the stillness of a moonlit night,
A spring crow calls once.

75.
White gold refines the six trigrams,
Black tin passes the three barriers.
In the depths of midnight,
The golden crow enters the vast cold.

76.
When the elixir ripens, no dragon or tiger,
When the fire ends, mercury and lead cease.
Having shed the embryo, already spirit-transformed—
Become a jade-pure immortal.

77.
Seal the road to the Yellow Springs,
Break open the gate of the Purple Palace.
The Sea Toad’s child—
Transforms into a crane, emerging from the muddy pellet.

78.
Where do rivers and seas return?
To whom do mountains and cliffs belong?
When the work is complete—
All are treasures within the house.

79.
Lü received the oral transmission from Zhong,
Ge imparted the heart-mind teaching to Zheng.
Idle words—
All return to mercury and lead.

80.
Mercury and lead return to one crucible,
Sun and moon must share the furnace.
Be wary of taboos—
That you may congeal the jade nectar.

81.
Gather the medicine and unite,
Advance the fire and bathe.

At the moment of shedding the embryo, the nine-by-nine Yang number is complete.

*Supplementary Writings on Cultivating the True: Pointers to the Mysterious, Scroll Three*
*The Purple Court Scripture*
Composed by the Perfected One of Emerald Emptiness

The Celestial Sovereign of the Crimson Palace governs Qian, the Creative;
The Qian Dragon soars to the Nine-Flowered Heaven.
Within the heavens lies the wondrous, boundless palace,
Where myriad scrolls of *Pointers to the Mysterious* reside.
Each scroll reveals the purport of the Golden Elixir,
A thousand phrases, ten thousand words—all converge in one.
It teaches one but to seek mercury and lead,
To gather these two and refine them within the crucible.
At night, fire erupts upon Kunlun Mountain,
Its flames aglow, the moon’s light grows cold.
Above the Winding River, the Golden Crow takes flight;
Chang’e rejoices with the Dipper and Ox.
Gather and refine them in but a moment,
A single qi, vast and subtle, traverses the Three Passes.
Through the Three Passes, qi flows endlessly,
A white meridian ascends to the Muddy Pellet.
Above the Muddy Pellet rests the Purple Gold Crucible,
Within the crucible, a lump of purple gold,
Transformed into jade nectar, flowing into the mouth,
Fragrant, sweet, and refreshing upon the tongue.
Swallowed and ingested, it enters the abdomen,
The viscera rejoice, the body at ease.
When the red serpent and azure tortoise unite,
Wind calms, waves still—tiger and dragon coil.
Divine water, serene; the Flowery Pond at peace,
White snow flurries drift on all sides.
A seven-jeweled tower of twelve stories,
Before it, yellow blossoms in profound splendor.
This is the essence of lead and mercury,
Transmuted into marrow, filling the gates and sources.
Simply seek the Celestial Cycle within the body,
After the waxing crescent, before the waning.
The medicine is balanced, the qi ample,
Heaven and earth, sun and moon meet in union.
The void naturally shatters into myriad fragments,
Chew through chaos, light as silk floss.
Kneaded back and forth, it forms a single coin,
The body suffused with jade’s luster and gold’s firmness.
Red blood is replaced by white blood’s flow,
Golden light fills the chamber, dense and resplendent.
A pool of autumn water cradles the bright moon,
A golden flower blooms like a red lotus.
At this time, the body’s spirit and qi are whole—
No need to seek the Dao or delve into Chan.
Now I know your worthiness,
That you are destined to become an immortal.
Clearly instructed, with few words,
Silently operate, adding and withdrawing.
Within a year, gather the moon—no need for years;
Within a month, seize the sun—months are in vain.
Within a day, grasp the hour—days are easily lost;
Within an hour, there are moments, profoundly mysterious.
Mysterious beyond mystery, inexpressible—
It is the new moon, full moon, dark moon, and crescent.
The Golden Elder and Maiden seize creation,
Ghosts and spirits weep in alarm.
Clouds disperse, rain scatters, all sounds stilled—
A single grain of the Mysterious Pearl sown in the Jade Field.
After ten months of firing, the sacred embryo rounds,
Nine revolutions, seven returns, cycling in turn.
First, the spine’s pass opens,
Next, the bladder blazes like fire.
Within, the two kidneys simmer like boiling water,
Timely stirred, they surge toward the heart’s origin.
Heart and kidneys, water and fire, naturally interact—
Who causes the separation of metal and wood?
The Yellow Court’s qi resides in the Central Palace,
Governing all phenomena, the heart holds sway.
The water’s source, clear as a jade mirror—
Who sets the river chariot sailing like a boat?
In an instant, flames soar, scorching the heavens,
The crow’s soul and hare’s spirit scatter like dust.
Thus, silently seek the true root—
A single path leads to the numinous true.
Clearly, essence is enveloped by qi,
Gradually, qi accumulates to generate spirit.
This spirit is the essence of heaven and earth,
Pure Yang, undying—the true person.
Knowing this, you should cultivate immortality;
To cultivate immortality, only the Golden Elixir’s gate remains.
The Golden Elixir has no second formula—
A single acre within the body is your homestead.
Saliva, nasal mucus, essence, fluids, qi, blood—
These seven yin substances—what use are they?
Within Kan, it is not the kidney but the numinous root;
At the pool’s bottom, the sun glows red, the mare gallops.
Seven returns, nine revolutions—achieved in a moment,
All things in creation are thus born.
Only this true operation of Qian and Kun—
No need for vain, wordless striving.
Without thought or念, the spirit is already dull—
How can it congeal into the embryo immortal?
The embryo immortal is but the union’s fruition,
This union occurs in but a fleeting instant.
Do you yet know of the great intestine’s return,
Just before the Winter Solstice’s few days?
It is said when the golden essence descends,
With what is the golden essence restored?
The golden essence is but the medicine of Kun Palace,
Kun rules the southwest, the river’s source.
The toad’s light shines all day upon the Western River—
This is the root of the medicine.
Exchange hours for days, moments for hours—
A single drop of sweet dew, the numinous spring.
Swallowed, it surges through the heart meridian, piercing the lung’s transport point,
Falling into the bladder, it forms the elixir.
The elixir’s head does not congeal in the bladder—
Though it enters the bladder, it resides in the liver.
The liver, wood’s fluid, meets the golden essence;
Encountering earth, they unite to complete the Great Return.
Do not say this is deliberate effort,
Lest it become attachment to form.
From attachment to form, one reaches formlessness—
Refine essence into qi, qi returns to the root.
The root of qi congeals into spirit,
Only then is it called effortless and spiritually efficacious.
Like husband and wife in union,
A single drop of essence and blood forms the infant.
Their union, stirred by emotion, produces essence—
Even so, the infant matures in ten months.
How much more so when the cosmos is in your hands,
The body’s tiger roars, the dragon sings.
Though the dragon’s song is unseen,
Waves surge high, thousands of fathoms.
Though the tiger’s roar is unheard,
Deep in the night, winds howl through myriad forests.
From the moment the elixir’s path congeals,
Through the firing’s completion,
Until the tenth month, when frost descends—
Ghosts and spirits flee, daring not contend.
A year comprises twelve months,
Who dares bathe at Mao and You?
Thus, in the tenth month, enter the spirit chamber,
The golden crucible brims with dragon’s essence.
The mechanism of binding clouds and seizing the moon—
With the formula, cultivation is no difficulty.
If you truly bind the clouds upon the mountain,
And grasp the moon’s soul—
Understanding these words, you follow the ancients—
What worry is there that your body will not ascend?
The body’s hub, the heart’s flesh—
Within the heart lies a priceless treasure.
It can give me life or bring me death,
It can starve or satiate.
Seek the true, trace the path to its origin—
Carefree and joyful, free from hunger and cold.
Such states and proofs—
All lie within a day’s work.

The work seems leisurely, yet the medicine is not distant—gathering it is no difficulty.
Who knows the crimson blaze of ten thousand fathoms?
It sears the Three Worms, chilling the jade crucible.
The cinnabar field, too, can yield purple mushrooms;
The Yellow Court, in turn, engenders crimson essence.
One taste of crimson essence—hunger never returns;
One dose of purple mushrooms—youth’s face remains.
The body brims with white milk-flowers,
Golden sinews and jade bones—death will not come.
From deathlessness comes the completion of merit;
With merit fulfilled and conduct perfected, cranes arrive—
One leap, and you ascend the clouds.

**The Marrow of the Yin Talisman**
The Way of embracing the One—this is what the immortals practice, and Heaven protects them.
The world cannot attain it, for it is the primordial essence of the Great Unity.
The Great Unity is the source of the Supreme Ultimate and the Great Abyss, the Dao of refining spirit through emptiness.
The One is qi.
If one can harmonize the true qi of the Great Unity with one’s own true qi, enveloping them in supreme harmony, and refine them over time, this becomes the Great Elixir.
The Elixir is pure yang.
Yang is the Way of Heaven.
Thus, when spirit unites with the Dao and gathers, it takes form; when it scatters, it becomes wind—therefore, it communicates with the Dao.
Communication means the Dao nourishes qi.
To nourish qi is to preserve spirit.
Spirit is the Way of Heaven.
Thus, when essence and qi harmonize over time and fire is applied, true qi takes form.
This is called refining pure yang, using the body as the nation, the heart as the ruler, and essence as the people.
Expel the yin demons—
The body is the furnace,
The head is the crucible.
When essence fills the brain, fire is used to refine it.
Fire is yang;
Breath is wind.
With wind fanning the fire, refine form and spirit—
When both are wondrous, this is called refining form.
To refine form, first stabilize the heart within, so true qi surges in harmony.
Fire is the qi of cinnabar yang, the pure essence of the Elixir.
Circulating without cease, rising and sinking in ceaseless return, encompassing all things—thus it is cinnabar yang.
Heaven and Earth are the essence of yin and yang.
Heaven’s qi descends and then ascends; Earth’s qi ascends and then descends.
Heaven’s yang essence crystallizes as the sun; Earth’s yin essence crystallizes as the moon.
If one grasps the mechanism of the Dipper’s handle, naturally it turns the movement of sun and moon without rest—this is the Dao of refining spirit with pure yang.
Above the Celestial Pivot, the primordial qi of Heaven pours in; below the Celestial Pivot, the primordial qi of Earth pours in.
Within the Celestial Pivot, yin and yang intermingle—
If one can merge them, above and below become boundless, and one’s years equal Heaven’s.
Yet people today cannot comprehend this, for greed and desire deplete their essence, the heart loses its spirit, the body labors and scatters qi—
Thus they die in darkness, undone by the Five Thieves.
Those who perceive this thrive; those who do not perish.
The Five Thieves are the upright qi of the Five Phases.
Heavenly perfection is the origin of the Dao.
It nurtures the myriad things, holds the power of life and death, and is the root of creation.
When it fills the body over time, essence harmonizes with heavenly perfection.
Heaven’s qi descends to Earth, and Earth’s qi receives it without parting.
If one can recognize this, one will not die.
Master Guangcheng said: “I have lived twelve thousand years, all due to the upright principle of the Five Phases.”
The Five Phases are the Five Viscera.
Water receives the qi of the One—
In humans, the kidneys belong to Water.
Before a person is born, the Dao is their foundation.
The Gate of Life corresponds above to the primordial source of the Great Unity in the north, the root of creation.
Next, the left kidney generates the pulse of life, surging upward to greet the origin.
Descending to Xun and Kun, within lies the primordial foundation.
Gathering the qi of the four seasons, it enters the Central Palace and ascends to the crown of the head—thus it enacts Heaven’s work.
The head is round, symbolizing Heaven; the feet are square, symbolizing Earth.
Within, the upright qi of the Five Phases gathers.
Entering the Crimson Palace, it disperses to reach the sinews and bones, rising and descending in ceaseless return, merging with the Bubbling Spring to unite the myriad spirits.
Thus, when green yang reaches the head, all yin scatters.
Further employing the Five Phases’ upright qi of Heaven, which descends within—
When the Five Phases dwell together, entering the crucible to refine the Elixir, one does not die.
Heaven uses the Dipper as its mechanism; humans use the heart as theirs.
Heaven’s mechanism operates through yin and yang; the human mechanism perfects the Great Dao.
The Great Dao is non-action.
In non-action, nature is not disordered; when nature is not disordered, spirit does not stray; when spirit does not stray, essence does not scatter; when essence does not scatter, qi does not drift; when qi does not drift, essence and fire follow one another.
When essence and fire do not scatter, the myriad spirits gather in the homeland of spirit, within the Kunlun Mountains, ascending to the crown of the head—
Only then does one attain the creation of the primordial qi.
Thus, the Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three gives birth to the myriad things.
The One is the root of Heaven and Earth, the origin of yin and yang.
The myriad things rely on it to be born and completed; the thousand spirits depend on it for flourishing or withering.
From the lofty heavens to the deep earth, from grotto-heavens to immortal palaces, from mysterious constellations to sacred images of divine perfected—
Not a single thing is born without the primordial qi.
Before birth, one first receives Heaven’s qi, which becomes human nature.
Then, the two qi unite to form the body.
If one can still the heart like an unmoving Heaven, one becomes one with Heaven and Earth.
The human heart is the root of the mechanism.
If one can preserve the heart and guard the spirit, taking the heart as nature and qi as life—
Yet if one cannot practice this, qi is cut off and life perishes, all due to disordered nature and scattered spirit.
The Way of Heaven is the pure qi.
Humans receive the One qi, embodying the principle of nurturing the myriad spirits with pure yang—thus it is called the Way of Heaven.
The mechanism of creation is transformation.
The dragon is qi;
The serpent is fire.
If one circulates essence and qi in ceaseless ascent and descent, seizing the creation of Heaven and Earth—this is called the mechanism.
If one abandons the Five Desires and moves with the mechanism’s power—
Like Heaven’s work, the true green yang within the human kidneys, the tortoise and serpent, ascends to communicate with the primordial qi of Heaven.
Through breath, above and below respond, rising to leave the earth.

Guangchengzi said:
Within the qi sea one cun and three fen below the navel lies a measure of true essence. Inside are two meridians—on the left, the Cinnabar Yang Meridian; on the right, the Numinous Yang Meridian. These two meridians ascend to connect with the brain. Therein lies a palace called the Numinous Yang Palace, which contains two cavities: on the left, the Supreme Ultimate Cavity; on the right, the Penetrating Emptiness Cavity. Above, they communicate with the qi of Heaven; below, they reach the primordial sea—thus, through breath, the qi of Heaven descends to nourish the true essence. The ascending force is the dragon, the root of green yang; the descending force is the serpent, the origin of primordial qi. When these two qi intersect, they form the Great Medicine. With prolonged refinement, the elixir is completed—thus, one does not die. Through prolonged refinement, the spirit transcends the material world—thus, one rises from the earth.

When humans harbor the mechanism of destruction and guard the yang spirit, yin and yang ascend and descend. Heaven does so through the winter and summer solstices; humans do so through each inhalation and exhalation. On exhalation, qi reaches the root; on inhalation, it reaches the stem. With each inhalation, the qi of Heaven descends; with each exhalation, the qi of Earth ascends. When I circulate true qi to guide the qi of Earth below upward to Heaven—this is called the reversal of Heaven and Earth.

Heavenly nature must not be disordered; spirit and qi must not be displaced. When one can unite with essence and qi to generate the myriad spirits, it is as if Heaven and Earth are harmonious and nurture all things. The sage inwardly refines clarity while outwardly restraining desires, dwelling in stillness before the Great Beginning, where no distinction of skill or clumsiness yet exists.

The Three Essentials are the Mysterious Female, the Jade Gate, and the Golden Barrier. Above, they connect to Heaven; below, to Earth. One must never let the eyes observe and the heart stir, the ears listen and the spirit wander, or the mouth speak and the qi scatter—for if the Three Essentials are disturbed, the spirit disperses.

Within the human heart are two apertures: on the left, the Mysterious; on the right, the Female. Below, they enter the qi sea; above, they connect to the Mud Pill Palace. This is the true interconnection of the Jade Gate and Golden Barrier, which flank the spine, pass through the Three Barriers, and pay homage to the Northern Culmen. When the yang cavity stirs, it nurtures the true.

Guangchengzi said: Wood without fire does not turn to ash; humans without nature do not die. Fire scatters the spirit; when the spirit scatters, qi departs; when qi departs, the body perishes. A state with long-standing treachery will collapse; a body with long-standing evil will die. Remove treachery, and there is peace; remove evil, and there is tranquility.

Heaven and Earth plunder the Great Void; humans, in turn, plunder Heaven and Earth. The *dieluo* are worms in the human abdomen that consume my soul and spirit, dissipate my qi and essence, and scatter my blood. Yet if one can restore the mechanism of yin-yang creation, they cannot cause harm.

The sage employs the mechanism to emulate the transformative power of creation, cultivating thus to ascend to the celestial realm. Heaven uses one qi to nurture the myriad things; humans receive one qi to generate the myriad spirits. To dissipate this one qi is to invite death.

The ancient sages consumed the qi of Heaven at appointed times, regulating the hundred vessels. By drinking deeply of the true qi of Grand Harmony and focusing intention on the field of the body, the five viscera become cool and clear, the six bowels harmonious and at peace, the joints filled with primordial qi, and the spirit settled.

Guangchengzi said: The softness and weakness of qi penetrate the sinews and bones, settle the spirit, and ensure the free flow of the joints—how can this not be the principle?

When the numinous mechanism is employed internally, it undergoes a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations. Heaven operates the mechanism to nurture the myriad things; humans operate the mechanism to achieve boundless transformation. People perceive external omens of fortune and misfortune and respond accordingly, yet they do not realize that within themselves lies the divine—this is what makes one an immortal, what defines the divine.

The sun and moon are the purest essences of yin and yang. They traverse the eight directions, with cold and heat alternating, fulfilling the intent of Heaven and Earth, established in the path of the sun and moon’s circuit. The sun rises and the moon sets—all within the realm of number. Number is one; one is qi. The sage who attains this comprehends the principles of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, and geography, firmly cultivating qi and nurturing the spirit without straying from the Dao—thus, the myriad transformations begin.

The noble one can endure hardship; the petty person, upon hearing this, scoffs and treats life lightly. The Three Returns reside in the Three Origins: the true qi of Heavenly Origin dwells at the head, the true qi of Numinous Origin at the center, and the true qi of Root Origin below.

Essence is the teacher; the heart is the sovereign; the body is the form. When the three yang circulate within for a long time, the spirit naturally pays homage to the origin—thus, one does not die. By means of the Dao of Heaven, one transforms the myriad things below, receiving the life bestowed by the Dao, naturally and spontaneously.

This is the great kindness of life—not indulging the heart in sensual desires. Calm the heart and preserve the qi, and the transformative power of creation will naturally bestow kindness. Curb desires, rectify the heart, stabilize the qi, guard the spirit and embrace the One. In utmost stillness, daily renewal leads to the source, to the divine—this is the root of yin and yang.

If the eyes do not gaze upon sensual forms, the spirit does not wander; when the spirit does not wander, qi is stored within. In the supreme joy of celestial truth, there is no disturbance to the end.

Guangchengzi said: The *qin* is the bird of the southern direction. If one can subdue and preserve true essence and strength for a long time, one will soar like the *qin* into the Great Void. Yet this is nothing more than becoming a flying immortal through qi, reducing excess to supplement deficiency. The excess lies in the heart; the deficiency, in essence. If one cannot reduce the excess, one cannot supplement the deficiency. To supplement deficiency is to cause harm. Restraining desires, concealing the form, and binding the material world may seem tasteless, yet kindness resides within—harm contains kindness.

The principle of Heaven and Earth, the mechanism of the sage, the sprout of the supreme Dao, the root of the myriad things, the origin of yin and yang—thus, creation is inexhaustible. The sage, in the essence of the supreme Dao, possesses what is mine. The Dao’s vitality is such that the myriad things are themselves, yet I alone am wise.

Yin and yang do not prevail—what prevails is my use of them, my spirit, my numinosity. When yin and yang equally prevail in Heaven and Earth, the two qi conjoin, and the myriad things are as one. When wisdom and spirit are as one with qi, this is the sage—distinct from ordinary people, thus becoming an immortal.

The Three Essentials are derived from the *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Consecration Classic*. The first essential is the head, the Great Abyss—this is the position where the Valley Spirit resides.

The upper corresponds to the Dark Capital, the realm where the ten thousand spirits gather. If one can open this, the Valley Spirit will naturally reside there, true breath will settle of itself, and hunger and thirst will vanish of themselves.

The second essential is the heart, the Crimson Palace. If one can empty the heart and concentrate the spirit, achieving the union of spirit and qi, with breath ceasing its movement—this is called the Great Stillness. Now, the spirit is the origin of Heaven and Earth, the root of nature and life, the ancestor of sun and moon, the chief of dragon and tiger, the foundation of yin and yang. With each breath, four beats occur. The Most High said: twenty-four beats make one *dao*, two hundred forty beats make one *gui*—thus the sage calls it the *dao-gui*.

The third essential lies between the two kidneys, at the boundary of water and fire—this is called the Earth Gate. There is a spirit here named Peach Prosperity, which connects upward to the Nine Heavens and downward to the Bubbling Spring. The gathering and dispersal of true qi all pass through this gate. Thus the sage says: the Gate of Heaven is ever open, the Earth Gate forever closed.

If one can master these Three Essentials, spirit and qi will naturally intermingle. The *Yin Consecration Classic* states: "The deviance of the nine apertures lies here." The Three Essentials correct precisely this.

**The Outer Three Essentials**
The Outer Three Essentials are the Gate of the Mysterious Female. The mouth connects to the five viscera; what issues forth is heavy and turbid qi, belonging to yin. All the hundred grains and various flavors are the essence of Earth, entering through the mouth and joining with Earth—this is called the Earth Root. The nose connects to the six bowels; what issues forth is light and pure qi, belonging to yang, joining with Heaven—this is called the Heaven Root. The Most High said: "The Gate of the Mysterious Female is the Heaven Root." The nose has two apertures, the mouth one aperture—together, three apertures. This is the gate through which spirit and qi come and go. The yang spirit is the mysterious, the yin breath is the female. Within this gate dwell the celestial soul and earthly soul, merging with my spirit and qi as one—thus it is forcibly named the Mysterious Female, though it is two things.

*(Originally titled "Court Classic," should be "Purple Court Classic.")*
*Collected Writings on Pointing to the Dao in the Ten Books of Cultivating Perfection, "On Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation" Chapter 4*

Bai Yuchan of Hainan, from youth, served Master Chen Niyuan for nine years. One day, beneath the pines in a secluded crag, with wind clear and moon bright, the night still and mist cold, he pondered the great matter of life and death, the swiftness of impermanence. Bowing twice in reverence, he asked: "Though I have served you but briefly, I fear my blessings are shallow and my karma slight. Dare I ask—is there a share of immortality for me in this life?"

Chen Niyuan replied: "Every person may attain it—how much more so you?"

Bai Yuchan said: "Not shirking the weight of your dignity, I venture an overbold question: How many gates are there in immortal cultivation? How many methods in elixir refinement? My understanding remains as unpolished jade—pray, grant me a single word of enlightenment."

Chen Niyuan said: "Come, and I will tell you. There are three ranks in immortal cultivation, three grades in elixir refinement.

The Dao of Heavenly Immortals enables transformation and ascension—superior scholars may study it. Take the body as lead, the heart as mercury, stillness as water, wisdom as fire. In a single moment, coagulation may occur; in ten months, the embryo forms. This is the superior-grade method of elixir refinement. It has no hexagrams or trigrams, no weights or measures. Its method is simple and direct, transmitted mind-to-mind—easily accomplished.

The Dao of Water Immortals enables concealment and manifestation—middling scholars may study it. Take qi as lead, spirit as mercury, noon as fire, midnight as water. In a hundred days, union may occur; in three years, the image forms. This is the middle-grade method of elixir refinement. Though it has hexagrams and trigrams, it has no weights or measures. Its method is subtle and wondrous, transmitted orally—surely attainable.

The Dao of Earthly Immortals enables the preservation of form and dwelling in the world—common scholars may study it. Take essence as lead, blood as mercury, the kidneys as water, the heart as fire. In a year, fusion may occur; in nine years, success is achieved. This is the inferior-grade method of elixir refinement. It has both hexagrams and trigrams, as well as weights and measures. Its method is complex and difficult, transmitted through texts—hard to accomplish.

The superior-grade elixir method takes spirit, qi, celestial soul, earthly soul, intent, and will as medicinal ingredients; waking, dwelling, sitting, and lying as firing times; purity and spontaneity as application.

The middle-grade elixir method takes the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys as medicinal ingredients; years, months, days, and hours as firing times; embracing the One and guarding unity as application.

The inferior-grade elixir method takes essence, blood, marrow, qi, and fluids as medicinal ingredients; swallowing breath and rubbing the body as firing times; visualization of ascent and descent as application.

In general, the subtlety does not lie in following diagrams to seek a steed. Those who cling to images and adhere to texts, vainly proud and arrogant, will reach old age without achievement."

Bai Yuchan said: "For many years, I read elixir texts as though walking through thorns. Today, the dusty mirror is bright, clouds part and the moon shines clear. All myriad methods return to the One; all illusions return to reality. Yet I still do not know—where to begin the work?"

Chen Niyuan said: "Excellent question! The essentials of elixir refinement: take the body as the altar, furnace, tripod, and cauldron; the heart as the chamber of spirit; upright sitting and cultivating stillness as gathering and extraction; vigilant attention as firing; action and cessation as advance and retreat; interruption and distraction as guarding the embankment; application as drawing and adding; true qi steaming as bathing; calming thoughts as nurturing the fire; subduing body and mind as field combat; concentrating spirit and gathering qi as defending the city; forgetting scheming and severing deliberation as life and death; the arising of thought as the Mysterious Female; forging into a single mass as union; returning to the root and restoring life as elixir completion; transferring spirit as changing the tripod; having a body beyond the body as shedding the embryo; returning to the origin and reverting to the source as true emptiness; shattering the void as fulfillment.

Thus one may gather to form shape, scatter to become qi, coming and going without hindrance, carefree and natural."

Bai Yuchan asked: "Diligent yet unmet, one must meet a perfected being; met yet indolent, one ends as a lowly ghost. What verification is there for this method of elixir refinement?"

Chen Niyuan said: "At the outset of elixir refinement, spirit is clear and qi is fresh, body and mind harmonious and joyful. Chronic illnesses vanish entirely; dreams cease. One may fast for a hundred days, drink wine without intoxication. At this stage, red blood is transmuted into white blood, yin qi refined into yang qi. The body becomes fiery-hot, steps swift as flight. The mouth can dry water, breath can cook meat. Facing scenes without attachment, unmoving as suchness. One may command ghosts and spirits, summon thunder and rain, hear the Nine Heavens, see ten thousand miles. The body becomes purely yang, sinews of gold and bones of jade. The yang spirit manifests its form, coming and going naturally—this is the Dao of eternal life and deathlessness complete.

Yet I fear worldly people cling to theories of medicinal ingredients and firing times, taking them as tangible and deliberate, unable to awaken suddenly. How could they know that before the separation of primordial chaos, there were no years, months, days, or hours; before the birth of father and mother, there were no essence, blood, qi, or fluids? The Dao is originally formless—metaphorically called dragon and tiger. The Dao is originally nameless—compared to lead and mercury.

If one studies the Dao of Heavenly Immortals, one must perfect both form and spirit, merging with the Dao in true union. How can one be bound by yin and yang, fettered within the Five Phases? One must leap beyond heaven and earth to be called a master of the Dao.

Some may doubt, saying this method resembles Chan practice. Yet know this: all day discoursing and questioning is but dry wisdom; years of withered sitting in dullness is but stubborn emptiness. The study of Heavenly Immortals is like a pearl in a crystal dish—rolling freely, lively and vibrant, naturally round and luminous. Such a Heavenly Immortal is truly a Golden Immortal."

This is the ineffable mystery—who knows it, who practices it? If one understands the *Vajracchedikā* and *Yuanjue* sutras, the meaning of the Golden Elixir becomes self-evident. Why distinguish between the differences of Lao and Śākya? There is no second Dao in the world, no dual mind in the sage. Moreover, each person is complete, each is perfectly realized—just as everywhere the green willows can tether a horse, every household’s gate opens onto Chang’an. One need only take the swiftest path.

Yu Chan says: Those who study immortality in the world are many, yet most study without encountering the Way, encounter it without practicing, practice without diligence, and in old age willingly descend to death beneath the Nine Springs. Is this not tragic? Now I set down the master’s oral instructions, carving them into wood to transmit to the world. Yet in doing so, I reveal the celestial mechanism—will I not incur blame? Niwan says: I shall transform all under heaven into immortals. If I am punished for this, would Heaven not be Heaven? The sutra says: My life is in my hands, not in Heaven’s. What blame could there be?

Yu Chan asks: Why was Ancestor Zhang Pingshu, though thrice transmitting to the unworthy, thrice afflicted with misfortune? Niwan replies: At that time, he lacked discernment, and moreover, his intent was not universal. Alas! The master may be at the edge of the sky, the disciple at the corner of the sea—how much harder is it to recognize a person amid worldly dust? Now I publish this to circulate throughout the world, so that those who cultivate immortality may seek meaning in the text, and the subtle principles will shine forth. This is truly a gift from Heaven—why rely on brush and tongue to transmit it?

One must settle into stillness, thought within no-thought, the work pure and unified, forged into a single whole. All day, silently like a hen brooding her eggs—then spirit returns to qi, and naturally the Mysterious Pass appears. Vast without exterior, minute without interior, this is the gathering of primordial qi, the mother of the Golden Elixir. Practice diligently, and in days you may ride alongside Zhong and Lü. This is a proven effect, offered as guidance to those who study immortality.

I have carefully compiled the essentials of these questions and answers, naming it *On Resolving Doubts in the Cultivation of Immortality*.

**Discourse on the Valley Spirit That Does Not Die**

The "valley" is the Celestial Valley. The "spirit" is the original spirit of the body. The valley of Heaven harbors creation, contains emptiness; the valley of Earth holds the ten thousand things, bears mountains and rivers. Humans, sharing the same endowment as Heaven and Earth, also possess a valley. This valley stores the True One and houses the original spirit. Thus, the head has nine palaces, corresponding to the nine heavens. The central palace is called the Mud Pill, also known as the Yellow Court, Kunlun, or Celestial Valley—its names are many. It is the palace where the original spirit resides, hollow like a valley, and the spirit dwells within, hence called the Valley Spirit.

When the spirit abides, there is life; when it departs, there is death. By day, it engages with things; by night, it meets in dreams. The spirit cannot rest in its dwelling. Before the yellow millet ripens, before waking from the Southern Branch dream, a lifetime of honor and disgrace, wealth and poverty, a century of sorrow and joy are all tasted in an instant. If it departs and does not return, wanders and does not come back, then the paths of life and death are sundered, the roads of darkness and light cut off.

From this, we see that humans cannot give themselves life—the spirit gives them life. Humans cannot bring about their own death—the spirit brings about their death. If the spirit dwells in its valley and does not die, how can a person die? Yet the Valley Spirit does not die because of the Mysterious Female. The "mysterious" is yang, Heaven; the "female" is yin, Earth. Thus, the Mysterious Female’s two qi each have profound meanings, which cannot be known without receiving oral instructions from a perfected one.

The *Spiritual Pivot* says: The Celestial Valley’s original spirit, guarded, remains true. It speaks of the human body: above is the Celestial Valley, the Mud Pill, the palace that stores the spirit; in the middle is the Crimson Palace, the palace that stores qi; below is the Spirit Valley, the Pass of Origin, the palace that stores essence. The Celestial Valley is the primordial palace, the chamber of the original spirit, the abode of numinous nature—it is the essence of spirit.

The sage grasps the essentials of Heaven and Earth, knows the source of transformation. The spirit guards the primordial palace, qi ascends to the female’s mansion. Spirit and qi interact, naturally becoming true, uniting with the Dao, entering into neither death nor life. Thus it is said: The Valley Spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female.

The sage operates within the Mysterious Female, creating in the midst of vagueness. When the qi of the Mysterious Female enters its root, excessive restraint leads to tension, while indulgence leads to dissipation. One must make it continuous, unbroken. If one preserves it, following its natural course, the spirit will naturally calm, breath will naturally settle, nature will enter spontaneity, and the wondrous function of non-action will never reach exhaustion. Thus it is said: Use it without exertion.

From this, it is clear that the Mysterious Female is the true path of ascent and descent for the two sources of yin and yang. Worldly people, not delving into its root or investigating its source, take the nose as the mysterious and the mouth as the female. If the nose and mouth are the Mysterious Female, then what shall we call the gate of the Mysterious Female? These are all failures to reach its subtlety. Without being a great sage, how can one thoroughly investigate this principle?

**Discourse on the Ascent and Descent of Yin and Yang**

Heaven, by the Dao of qian, is light and pure, thus above. Earth, by the Dao of kun, is heavy and turbid, thus below. The primordial qi circulates between them without cease. That which is above employs yang—after the Winter Solstice, the qi of the single yang rises from Earth, accumulating for one hundred eighty days until it reaches Heaven. When yang reaches its extreme, yin is born. That which is below employs yin, accumulating for one hundred eighty days until it reaches Earth. When yin reaches its extreme, yang is born.

A single ascent and a single descent—thus their coming and going are endless. Humans receive the harmonious qi to be born between Heaven and Earth, sharing the same body with them from the very beginning. The qi of Heaven and Earth completes one cycle in a year; the qi of the human body completes one cycle in a day. From *zi* to *si* is the time of yang’s ascent, so *zi* is regarded as the Winter Solstice within the day, corresponding in the *Yi* to *Fu*. From *wu* to *hai* is the time of yin’s descent, so *wu* is regarded as the Summer Solstice within the day, corresponding in the *Yi* to *Gou*. When yin reaches its extreme, yang is born; when yang reaches its extreme, yin is born. Their alternation between day and night is just like the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth.

If one can emulate the function of Heaven and Earth’s hinge, maintaining emptiness and tranquility so that the single qi circulates through the hundred bones, then when it opens, qi issues forth; when it closes, qi enters in. Qi issuing forth is like the ascent of Earth’s qi; qi entering in is like the descent of Heaven’s qi. Thus one may attain the same longevity as Heaven and Earth. But if one rushes about in the realm of splendor or gallops in the arena of right and wrong, true qi will dissipate and no longer belong to oneself. It is better to guard the center with emptiness and stillness to nurture it.

The center is where the qi of Heaven and Earth’s Mysterious Female converges. If one can focus the mind on it without scattering, true essence will naturally arrive at dawn, primordial qi will naturally gather, the Valley Spirit will naturally connect, the Three Corpses will naturally depart, and the Nine Worms will naturally perish—this is the Dao of long life and enduring vision. From this we know that true breathing and primordial qi are the root of the human body’s nature and life. Deep roots and firm stems are the Dao of long life and enduring vision.

Human life is endowed with the single primordial qi of the great Dao. While in the mother’s womb, one shares breath with her; after birth, the umbilical cord is cut, and a single spark of primordial yang abides in the cinnabar field. True breathing enters and exits through the Heavenly Gate, connecting with Heaven above, ascending into the Mud Pill, meeting with the primordial spirit, and descending into the cinnabar field, communicating with primordial qi. *Zhuangzi* said: “The breath of the multitude reaches the throat; the breathing of the sage reaches the heels.” The heels represent the Dao of deep roots and firm stems. If one can banish all thoughts, true breathing will naturally settle, the body will enter the formless, and one will unite with the Dao, living long in the world. From this perspective, how can the Dao within the body not be revered? How can it not be prized?

Within the Alchemical Chamber: Discourses of Master Bai and Immortal Hu

Master Lü, crane-necked and tortoise-cheeked, chanced upon an encounter with Zhongli; Scholar Shi, deer-nosed and mouse-eared, fortuitously met the arrival of Pingshu. Alas, how rare are the seasons of hidden verdure—how can they compare to the pursuit of fame, profit, right, or wrong?

The great elixir of golden cinnabar, passed down but once in ten thousand kalpas by the ancients; the numinous scriptures of jade bamboo, wherein ten scholars are lost in nine delusions. The crow within the moon, the hare within the sun—reversing Kan and Li; the tiger in water, the dragon in fire—circulating and re-embryonating. Gathering the primordial qi of pre-heaven to serve as the marrow within lead, seizing the myriad transformations of stellar configurations to refine the essence within mercury.

Only in the moments before and after the crescent moon—at the juncture of waxing and waning—does one know: when *gui* arises, one must swiftly gather; those who remain ignorant may gaze afar but never taste. Half a catty of essence, half a catty of qi, all reside in the southwest position; one tael of cinnabar, one tael of medicine, truly dwell in the northeast quarter. Drawing the golden essence and wooden fluid into the Yellow Court, refining white snow and yellow sprouts into purple powder.

As *The Understanding Reality* says: “The divine water of the Flowery Pond knows fate’s discourse,” and further: “Gather and refine the earthly *po* and heavenly *hun*—then it is conjoined, then it is accomplished.” Like the first spark between husband and wife, ten months form the embryo; like the sovereign and minister meeting myriad affairs, the hundred officials assume their posts.

At winter solstice when the sun reaches its zenith, engage in field battle; at summer solstice when the season reaches its peak, hold the city fast. All this requires but a moment’s effort—verification comes in a single day. Calculating the nine-three and two-eight, it lies solely in the Maiden’s search for gold; reckoning the seven-six and one-three, it rests entirely with the Yellow Dame and Elder Ding. No need to peruse ten thousand volumes of alchemical classics—just a single oral formula suffices.

Your coming here is earnest; I know you have sought this for years, for unless you possessed such noble bones from a former life, how could you devote body and mind to this in a single day? From gathering the medicine to forming the embryo, from firing the process to shedding the body—it encompasses the subtleties of withdrawal and addition, depicts the mechanism of bathing. No worry of separation between metal and wood, but the joy of water and earth sharing the same homeland. Only nurturing is needed—no hardship remains.

Within the twelve hours, only one hour matters; within three hundred days, only half a day. When the Elixir Field holds its substance, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, there is no sorrow. When the Purple Palace records your name, life and death become mere exchanges, no longer a burden. Joy and clarity arise—henceforth, leisure. Even amidst bustle, this work can be practiced.

In discussing the profound, all connections are made in an instant—gathered yet never scattered, refined to ever greater firmness. The cinnabar tripod and crescent moon furnace—what difficulty is there in finding them? Guard the cauldron at the center of the altar, and seek only within yourself.

One must recognize yin and yang, understand the Mysterious Female. When dragon essence fills the tripod, dispatch the Golden Lad down the twelve-story tower; when phoenix marrow overflows the vessel, command the Jade Maiden to announce it across the three thousand worlds. At this moment, the elixir is ripe—then, like a loving mother cherishing her infant, soon the clouds will ascend, and the True Person will appear before the Emperor on High.

*Miscellaneous Writings on Cultivating the True: Pointers to the Mysterious, Scroll Five*
*The Four Hundred Characters on the Golden Elixir, with Preface*
*By Perfected Zhang Ziyang*

The Seven Returns and Nine Reversions Great Elixir of Golden Liquor refers to seven as the number of fire and nine as the number of metal. Refining metal with fire to return to the root and revert to the source is called the Golden Elixir. Divide body and mind into the upper and lower arcs, distinguish spirit and qi by the winter and summer solstices, and unite form and spirit with the Kan and Li trigrams. With the wood that restrains the hun-soul, the metal of the west’s po-soul, the fire of the south’s spirit, the water of the north’s essence, and the earth of the central intent, this is called the interpenetration of the Five Phases. By containing the light of the eyes and condensing the resonance of the ears, regulating the breath of the nose and sealing the qi of the tongue, this is called the harmonization of the Four Images. When the eyes do not see, the hun-soul abides in the liver; when the ears do not hear, the essence abides in the kidneys; when the tongue does not speak, the spirit abides in the heart; when the nose does not smell, the po-soul abides in the lungs; when the four limbs do not move, the intent abides in the spleen—this is called the Five Qi Returning to the Origin. Refining essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness, the qi abides in the spleen without leaking from the four limbs or orifices—this is called "non-leakage." As essence is refined, it is called the "Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown." When the hun-soul abides in the liver without leaking from the eyes, the po-soul in the lungs without leaking from the nose, the spirit in the heart without leaking from the mouth, and the essence in the kidneys without leaking from the ears, intent, spirit, hun-soul, and po-soul blend and merge, transforming into a single qi—imperceptible, formless, and nameless—this is called "emptiness and non-being."

To refine essence is to refine primordial essence, not the essence aroused by lust. To refine qi is to refine primordial qi, not the breath of mouth and nose. To refine spirit is to refine primordial spirit, not the spirit of thoughts and concerns. Thus, this spirit, qi, and essence share the same root as heaven and earth and the same body as the myriad things. Obtaining them brings life; losing them brings death. Refining them with yang fire transforms them into yang qi; nurturing them with yin talismans transforms them into golden essence—thus, "what is seen cannot be used; what is used cannot be seen."

The body is the dwelling of the heart; the heart is the master of the body. The heart’s wildness is like a dragon; the body’s ferocity is like a tiger. Within the body resides a single point of true yang qi; within the heart resides a single point of true yin essence—these are called the "Two Things." The heart belongs to Qian; the body belongs to Kun—thus, they are the cauldron and vessel of Qian and Kun. Yang qi belongs to Li; yin essence belongs to Kan—thus, they are the medicine of the Crow and Hare. Embracing the One and guarding the center, refining the primordial and nurturing simplicity—this is called "gathering the primordial qi of pre-heaven." From dawn’s *Zhun* to dusk’s *Meng*, from noon’s yang to midnight’s yin—this is called "circulating the fire times of the celestial cycle." Wood fluid flourishes at *mao*; metal essence flourishes at *you*—thus, one must bathe. The Zhen male drinks the wine of the west; the Dui female plucks the flower of the north. The Xun wind stirs the six yangs; the Kun earth stores their number—thus, one must withdraw and replenish.

At the outset of gathering the medicine, one moves the key of Qian and Kun and takes the *daogui* of Li and Kan. At first, it is like clouds filling a thousand mountains; next, like the moon cradling ten thousand waters. Naturally, it resembles the union of tortoise and snake, the pacing of horse and ox. Yet one does not realize: the dragon contends for the hun-soul, the tiger for the po-soul, the crow for essence, the hare for spirit. Within the indistinct, true lead appears; within the profound darkness, true mercury exists. With the Yellow Dame as matchmaker, guard the Central Palace. Lead flees at the sight of fire; mercury scatters at the sight of fire. Thus, blend them with the oil of non-action and stabilize them with the uncarved jade. Lead returns to the Kun palace; mercury returns to the Qian position. True earth blends them, containing light in silence.

When the fire’s number is excessive, it scorches; when the water’s measure is too great, it overflows. The scorching of fire and the overflow of water must be balanced—thus, there are the methods of weights and measures. At this stage of refinement, wind arises in the Mud Pill Palace, the moon shines in the Crimson Palace, fire blazes in the Cinnabar Field, and waves settle in the Valley Sea. The spine turns like a wheel; the four limbs become like mountain stone. The pores feel as if just risen from a bath; bones and channels are as if in deep slumber. Spirit and essence unite like lovers in joy; hun-soul and po-soul cling like mother and child. This is the true realm, not a metaphor.

Refining with method gathers without scattering; refining with weights and measures binds ever more firmly. The hun-soul is stored; the po-soul is extinguished. Essence congeals; spirit solidifies. A single intent of harmonious qi pervades, and the skin becomes radiant. Day by day, hour by hour, it gradually congeals and gathers. From formlessness, form arises—thus, the Sacred Embryo is formed.

A year has twelve months; a month has thirty days; a day has one hundred *ke*. A month totals three thousand *ke*; ten months total thirty thousand *ke*. In movement and stillness, sitting and lying, one continuously abides in it. Once the fetal qi congeals, the infant manifests; the Mysterious Pearl takes form; the Great One contains the true. Thus, within these thirty thousand *ke*, one can seize the thirty thousand years of heaven. Why? Because each *ke* of effort corresponds to a year’s seasonal cycle—thus, thirty thousand *ke* can seize thirty thousand years. A year has twelve months, totaling thirty-six thousand *ke*. Even the dullest and most ignorant person, by practicing this, can ascend to the sacred realm. Yet how is it that the common people daily neglect it?

The loss of the primordial, the exhaustion of primordial qi, the impurity of primordial spirit—thus, in these thirty thousand *ke*, each *ke* must be harmonized. If even a single *ke* deviates, the medicinal materials dissipate, and the fire times falter. Thus, it is said: "A hair’s difference, and the elixir will not form." One must act in every *ke*, yet the effort is not laborious. True qi congeals; primordial spirit expands. Internally, one refines the elixir of thirty thousand *ke* in a year; externally, one seizes the thirty thousand years of a lifetime. In greatness, one forms the embryo of thirteen thousand five hundred breaths in a day; in smallness, one circulates the qi of eighty-four thousand *li* in twelve hours. Thus, it is said: "Seize the single yang of heaven and earth, gather the dual qi of sun and moon, circulate true water in the lead furnace, and move true fire in the mercury cauldron."

When lead encounters mercury, it is called the Flowery Pond; when mercury enters lead, it is called divine water. One must not cling to non-action, nor manifest in forced effort; one must not be rigid in visualization, nor attached to holding and guarding; one must not sit in lifeless stillness, nor practice blindly and recklessly. The greatest fear is not knowing the source of the medicinal materials, or being ignorant of the methods and measures of fire times. One must know the single aperture within the body, called the Mysterious Female. This aperture is neither heart nor kidney, neither mouth nor nose, neither spleen nor stomach, neither the anus nor the bladder, neither the Cinnabar Field nor the Mud Pill Palace.

To know this single aperture is to know where the winter solstice resides, where the medicinal materials lie, where the fire times are found, where bathing occurs, where the embryo forms, and where the body is shed. This aperture has no boundaries, no inside or outside; it is the root of spirit and qi, the valley of emptiness. Seek it within the body—it cannot be sought elsewhere. This aperture of essence cannot be conjectured by private speculation; it must be transmitted heart-to-mouth. Without such transmission, all efforts are in vain.

Herein lies this *Four Hundred Characters on the Golden Elixir*, encompassing the root of creation and transformation, threading through the marrow of yin and yang. It guides those who refine the elixir to trace the stream and know the source, to abandon delusion and follow truth, lest they forget the root and chase the branches.

The golden elixir arises from nothingness and is nurtured along its path. Yet its birth from nothingness must not be forced into the form of an infant; how can one cling to images and texts and drown in crooked byways and empty spaces? Know that this emptiness is true emptiness, and that within nothingness there is indeed something—this is true emptiness.

Now, as Ma Ziran departs, he speaks these words for your reflection:

True earth captures true lead,
True lead restrains true mercury.
Lead and mercury return to true earth,
Body and mind still and unmoving.

True earth is the earth within the body. Lead and mercury are the water and fire within the body. With earth restraining water, lead may be captured; with water restraining fire, mercury may be controlled. Why are lead-water and mercury-fire both subdued by true earth? Only when body and mind unite in stillness can earth, water, and wood merge as one—this is the method of gathering medicinal materials into the furnace and cauldron.

From emptiness, white snow is born;
From stillness, the yellow sprout emerges.
The jade furnace’s fire glows warmly,
Above the cauldron, purple mist soars.

White snow must arise from emptiness, for it is born from nothingness. The yellow sprout must be nurtured by fire, for fire gives birth to earth. Just as in the months of *zi* and *chou*, when yang qi has yet to stir and all things vanish into nothingness, white snow descends from heaven. By the months of *yin* and *mao*, when yang qi gradually flourishes and stillness holds movement within, the yellow sprout emerges from the earth. Once white snow and yellow sprout appear, the fire of the jade furnace need only be warmly nurtured, and naturally, purple mist will rise above the cauldron. If the fire is too fierce, it will scatter all.

The lotus of the Flowery Pond blooms,
Divine water’s golden waves grow still.
Deep in the night, the moon shines bright,
Heaven and earth become a single mirror.

The *hua* is the flower, akin to fire. The *shen* is the heart, which belongs to fire. The essence of the golden elixir lies in divine water, for the Flowery Pond embodies the principle of water and fire in harmony. When waves within water become clear and serene, fire gives birth to the lotus, and the flower naturally blooms. At midnight, the hour of *zi*, when the first yang stirs, the moon shines fully, its golden light illuminating heaven and earth as a single bright mirror.

Cinnabar refines yang qi,
Quicksilver cooks gold essence.
Gold essence and yang qi—
Cinnabar and quicksilver.

Yang qi is the single spark of true yang within the body. Gold essence is the single drop of true yin within the heart. Refined with yang fire, it becomes like cinnabar; nurtured with yin tally, it becomes like quicksilver. Cinnabar and quicksilver are external substances; using external medicines to describe the inner elixir is a last resort for immortals.

The sun’s soul is the jade hare’s marrow,
The moon’s spirit is the golden crow’s essence.
Gathered into the cauldron,
They transform into a pool of water.

The soul governs wood, and wood gives birth to fire, so spirit is stored in the soul. The spirit governs metal, and metal gives birth to water, so essence is stored in the spirit. If one can nourish spirit by absorbing wind and nurture essence by absorbing qi, then spirit and essence merge and harmonize within the cauldron, transforming into a pool of water.

Medicinal materials arise in the mysterious aperture,
Fire times ignite the yang furnace.
When dragon and tiger meet,
The precious cauldron yields the mysterious pearl.

The medicinal materials—crow’s liver, hare’s marrow, red mercury, black lead—all arise within the mysterious aperture. If one can rouse the fire of samadhi within the yang furnace, then dragon and tiger will meet, refining metal and wood to give birth to the yellow sprout, and finally producing a single grain of the mysterious pearl.

This aperture is no ordinary thing,
Formed by the union of heaven and earth.
Called the cavity of spirit and qi,
Within it lies the essence of *kan* and *li*.

The aperture of the Mysterious Female is no common object. Before this body existed, this aperture was already present. It is neither above nor below, neither within nor without—it is the primordial aperture. At the moment of the body’s conception, the father’s essence and the mother’s blood joined to form it, becoming the cavity of spirit and qi, which holds the essence of water and fire.

A single red drop of wood-mercury,
Three pounds of black metal-lead.
Lead and mercury congeal into cinnabar,
Glowing with the radiant hue of purple gold.

The homestead’s scenery is fair,
Wind and rain deepen spring’s care.
No plow nor hoe labors in vain,
For all the earth turns gold again.

The "homestead" is the true soil within the body,
The "scenery" the medicinal substances therein.
When the first yang revives,
Wind stirs it, rain nourishes it.
By the time the three yangs harmonize in *Tai*,
Though plow and hoe spare no effort,
Golden sprouts burst forth from the soil—
Called "gold" for the hue of the yellow sprout.

True lead is born in *Kan*,
Its function lies in *Li*.
From black it transforms to red,
A single cauldron thick with cloudy qi.
True mercury arises in *Li*,
Its function returns to *Kan*.
The old woman crosses the southern garden,
Holding a jade olive in hand.

True lead is the northern essence of water,
Ascending to the palace of *Li*.
True mercury is the southern spirit of fire,
Descending to the gate of *Kan*.
When lead and mercury unite as one,
Seen closely, they show red and black;
From afar, they resemble a jade olive.
The old woman crosses the southern garden riding a dragon,
The infant travels northward astride a tiger.
The dragon coils in the golden cauldron,
The tiger dwells in the cinnabar field.
Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger—
Within the cauldron, misty vapors rise in swirling steam.

*Zhen* and *Dui* are not east and west,
*Kan* and *Li* not south and north.
The Dipper’s handle circles the heavens,
One must grasp its convergence.
*Zhen* and *Dui*, *Kan* and *Li*—
Not mere directions of east, west, south, or north,
But the trigrams’ qi of heaven and earth.
Like the Dipper’s handle pointing to the lunar station,
Circling the heavens in a single day,
The fire-sign within the body completes its cycle in an instant.
If one cannot fuse the Five Phases,
How can one match the Dipper’s revolution?

The firing times do not rely on seasons,
Winter solstice is not confined to *Zi*.
When it comes to the bathing method,
*Mao* and *You* are likened to emptiness.
The great firing schedule is not bound to winter solstice at *Zi* or summer solstice at *Wu*.
Nor is bathing fixed to spring equinox at *Mao* or autumn equinox at *You*.
Once the fire is kindled within the body,
The celestial cycle naturally includes withdrawal and bathing—
No need to cling to the four seasons.

Crow’s liver and hare’s marrow,
Seized and brought to one place.
Grain by grain they accumulate,
From subtle to substantial.
The crow’s liver is the sun’s soul,
The hare’s marrow the moon’s essence.
Refined together by fire,
Each day a grain the size of millet forms,
Growing from subtle to substantial.
After thirty days, it weighs thirty-eight *zhū* and four *sù*;
After three hundred days, three hundred eighty-four *zhū*,
Round and one *cùn* in size, weighing one *jīn*.

Chaos embraces the void,
The void encompasses the Three Realms.
Yet trace it to its root—
A single grain the size of millet.
Chaos is the union of yin and yang,
The convergence of the Five Phases and harmony of the Four Images.
Its measure equals the void, and the void contains it;
It roams the Three Realms, and the Three Realms contain it.
Yet seek its origin,
And it begins at the Gate of the Mysterious Female,
As small as a grain of millet.

Heaven and earth exchange true fluids,
Sun and moon hold true essence.
Grasp the foundation of *Kan* and *Li*,
And the Three Realms return to one body.
When the heart’s fluid descends and the kidney’s fluid ascends,
Heaven and earth exchange true fluids.
The soul is the crow’s essence,
The spirit the hare’s marrow—
Thus sun and moon contain true essence.
If one understands the union of *Kan* and *Li*,
The Gate of Heaven opens, the Earth’s Door closes,
The sun shines on Kunlun, the moon rises from the sea—
And the Three Realms reside within this single body.

The dragon comes from the Eastern Sea,
The tiger rises from the Western Mountains.
The two beasts battle fiercely,
Transforming into the marrow of heaven and earth.
*Zhen* is the Azure Dragon, coming from the Eastern Sea.
*Dui* is the White Tiger, rising from the Western Mountains.
When the dragon’s roar summons clouds to descend,
And the tiger’s howl stirs winds to ascend,
The two beasts meet and clash before the Yellow Chamber—
Wind and cloud rejoice in union,
Merging into a single marrow.

Golden blossoms open mercury leaves,
Jade buds grow lead branches.
*Kan* and *Li* never rest,
How long until *Qian* and *Kun*?
The golden blossom is the essence of metal,
Above, it opens mercury leaves.
The jade bud is the fluid of jade,
Below, it grows lead branches.
If one ensures *Kan* and *Li* never idle,
A moment’s work can steal a year’s time from heaven and earth—
How much time is truly needed?

Bathing guards against peril,
Withdrawal and addition must be carefully maintained.
In all, thirty thousand moments—
A hair’s breadth of error brings failure.
Bathing is the method of transcendence,
Like ascending a seven-tiered pagoda or a three-story pavilion,
One must guard against danger.
Withdrawal and addition are the path to primordial unity—
Yang rises at the start of *Zi*, yin begins after *Wu*.
Without vigilance, loss is inevitable.
A day has one hundred moments,
A month three thousand.
Moment by moment, the work proceeds without weariness.
In ten months, thirty thousand moments can seize thirty thousand cycles.
But the slightest deviation—
And the elixir will not form.

When husband and wife unite,
Their chamber fills with clouds and rain.
After a year, a child is born,
Each one able to ride a crane.
The infant of *Kan* and the maiden of *Li*,
If the Yellow Matchmaker unites them as husband and wife,
Their chamber joins in union,
Clouds disperse, rain ceases—
And the sacred embryo forms.
After a year, the child is born,
Riding a crane forth from the Niwan Palace.
Ten months of gestation,
Two months of bathing—
Together, a full year.

After annotating *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*,
Five regulated verses were composed.
The first four on metal, wood, water, fire, and earth speak of the foundation of life;
The last speaks of the foundation of nature.
Nature is the substance of life,
Life is the function of nature—
For the Four Images and Five Phases all rely on earth.

Within it lie the crucible, the medicinal ingredients, the talismanic fire, the method and measure, the extraction and addition, the bathing, the embryo’s formation, and the liberation of the body.

Though these lines borrow from the worn and flawed,
They still await the refining hand of a master—
Thus do I place my hopes in those who have gone before.

A Postscript in Verse

I.
What in the human body is the Golden Elixir?
In the dim and indistinct, true yang turns inward to observe.
Wind from the heavens stirs the clear waves to a boil,
Thunder from the earth coils purple clouds in its wake.
Night after night, the jade crucible smelts lead to submission,
Hour after hour, the golden tripod tempers mercury to dryness.
Hold the fire steady for seven hundred and twenty breaths—
A thunderclap in Niwan Palace, and a chill of awakening arises.

II.
A path through the Magpie Bridge leads to the Mysterious Pass,
Erecting the crucible and setting the furnace is not arduous.
The Four Images harmonize, relying on earth,
The Three Flowers converge, returning to the mountain.
At midnight, it enters Kunlun’s realm,
After noon, it circulates to inquire of the vast sea.
Wait until the jade flask’s transmutation is complete—
Then, from the crown of the head, a transformed immortal emerges.

III.
To know the inversion of the Five Phases:
The dragon dwells in the mountains, the tiger in the fields.
From the Xun Palace, the fire of Qian’s heaven is blown forth,
At Li’s position, the spring of Kun’s earth is unsealed.
In *Fu* and *Shen*, extraction and addition must be cautious,
In *Zhun* and *Meng*, bathing demands diligence.
If one can recognize the place of one’s own birth,
After ten months, the embryo is complete, and a celestial being emerges.

IV.
For years uncounted, the Dao has been attained,
Above the Mysterious Pass, one swings like a pendulum.
The golden crow prefers to roost on mountain peaks,
The jade hare often slumbers in the depths of the sea.
A single qi steams upward from the north,
The three armies transport it toward the east.
I do not reveal the secrets of heaven lightly—
Only fear that the deluded will spread chaos in their zeal.

V.
Beyond the teachings of Caoxi, a separate transmission flows,
For the awakened, what matter if it comes before or after?
The field of nature blends into a single expanse,
The pearl of the heart shines clearly, illuminating the Three Fields.
Śākyamuni’s extinction was not true death,
Bodhidharma’s western return was also that of an immortal.
If only the world could grasp this principle,
Together we would transcend the other shore, needing no boat.

*Collected Writings on Cultivating the True: Miscellaneous Works on Pointing to the Mystery, Scroll Five* concludes.
*Collected Writings on Cultivating the True: Miscellaneous Works on Pointing to the Mystery, Scroll Six*
In gratitude to Zhang Ziyang’s writings,
By Bai Yuchan.

I bow my head a hundred times in reverent reply to the Venerable Master of Tiantai, the Perfected One of Realizing the True, the True Man Zhang of Purple Yang’s gate. On this day, as spring’s winds and rains awaken, all things grow verdant and chill. I humbly pray that the celestial spirits of water, grass, and valley, the divine soldiers of heaven and earth, left and right, may overflow with dragon essence, that the fire-tending remains serene and still, that golden flowers fill the chamber, and that root and destiny be restored.

I have heard it said: “There is no second Dao in the world, no dual heart in the sage.” The greatness of the Dao cannot be captured in form or description; if one were to describe this Dao, it would be emptiness, stillness, and void—subtly profound, deep, and silent. The vastness of the heart cannot be compared or likened; if one were to liken this heart, it would be purity, clarity, spiritual luminosity—harmonious, warm, and refined.

When the myriad transformations return to the one Dao, then all under heaven transforms itself, and the ten thousand things are naturally as they are. When the hundred deeds return to the one heart, then the sage naturally acts without acting, and all things arise without attachment. Extend this heart to merge with the Dao, and this heart is the Dao; embody this Dao to unite with the heart, and this Dao is the heart. The Dao fuses with the heart, the heart fuses with the Dao. Beyond the heart, there is no separate Dao; beyond the Dao, there is no separate thing.

Thus, heaven and earth were never originally Qian and Kun, yet the ten thousand things naturally embody Qian and Kun. The sun and moon were never originally separated from Kan, yet the ten thousand things naturally partake of Kan’s departure. Reflecting on our Dao Ancestor, the Most High Lord Lao, who enlightened the world with this Dao and clarified the heart for the sage: this Dao in the world cannot be objectified or transformed by things. Therefore, the principles of objectification and transformation exist in the world but not in this Dao. This Dao is thusness itself; to unite this heart with this Dao is fitting.

This heart in the sage cannot be known by knowledge or recognized by recognition; such principles exist in the sage but not in this heart. This heart is thusness itself; to unite this Dao with this heart is fitting. The Dao pulses through this heart, the heart marrowizes this Dao. I know not which is Dao and which is heart. I only perceive the indistinct and vague, the dim and obscure—something like a thing yet not a thing, something like an image yet not an image. If one listens with the ears, the eyes hear; if one looks with the eyes, the ears see. I fear this can only be named the marrow of yin and yang, the essence of chaos, the root of emptiness, the stem of the Great Ultimate.

The ancients, not knowing, forcibly named it the Dao. From today’s perspective, calling a rainbow a rainbow is but deluded refinement; pointing to jade as jade is but empty rhetoric. Is this not the Golden Elixir? Now, to know the wonder of the Golden Elixir, why fabricate the illusion of a furnace or cling to the form of a crucible? The Yellow Sprout and White Snow are not the visible Yellow Sprout and White Snow; the Divine Water and Flower Pool are not the usable Divine Water and Flower Pool. If likened to lead essence and mercury marrow, or compared to gold essence and wood liquid—where is the furnace for refining the crescent moon? Where is the crucible for smelting cinnabar? Knowing this, one says: the sun’s crow and moon’s hare, the heavenly horse and earthly ox.

Qian and Kun originally have no use for departing Kan, just as Kan has no substance of Qian and Kun. Red lead and black mercury—are these not the mating of dragon and tiger? White gold and black tin—are these not the union of tortoise and snake? The numbers two, eight, nine, and three are all variant meanings of yin and yang; the measures of jin, zhu, and liang are but remnants of chaos. In essence, they are harmonized and balanced, drawn out and applied. Thus, these medicinal substances are not materials of metal, stone, herbs, or wood; this fire-tending is not measured by years, months, days, or hours.

Before father and mother were born, there were already endless living paths. After body and mind cease movement, the infinite true mechanism of the limitless remains. Formerly, by long-standing karmic affinity, a withered bone was revived by a needle’s touch. Having long attended the master’s side, I have fortunately tasted the Dharma-milk. It is said: the essence of refining the Golden Elixir is to gather medicinal substances within stillness and conduct the fire-tending within non-action. It is to bathe in the union of spirit and qi, to match form and spirit. Only then does one realize that within the heart lies boundless medicinal material, and within the body lies boundless fire symbols.

Awakening to this, one refines the Elixir thus; cultivating the Dao thus, one carves stone to seek jade, refines sand to obtain gold, tempers the form to nurture spirit, and clarifies the mind to merge with the Dao—all are of one intent. This is the principle of extracting mercury from lead and cinnabar from sand. Proceeding accordingly, husband and wife unite.

Applying this principle to the Confucian classics, it is one; applying it to the Buddhist scriptures, it is one. Thus, there is no second Dao in the world. Since the Dao of heaven has no dual principles, how could the heart of the sage have two uses? Within form, spirit is sovereign, for spirit is the destiny of form; within spirit, nature is the ultimate, for nature is the destiny of spirit. From the spirit within form uniting with the nature within spirit—this is called returning to the root and restoring destiny.

This Dao is most clear, this heart no longer deluded. The secret of the seven returns and nine reversions is not transmitted in the world. The seven returns and nine reversions signify returning to the origin and reverting to the source. The numbers seven and nine are both yang numbers. If one can be without heart in the heart, without thought in thought, utterly pure and without blemish—this is called pure yang. At this time, the Three Corpses vanish, the Six Thieves surrender, and even if a body exists outside the body, it is not yet extraordinary. Only when emptiness is pulverized does the whole body fully appear.

The shallow understanding of the vulgar, the superficial learning of common folk—how could they know that the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and the celestial and terrestrial immortals daily gather medicinal substances without cease, and that the more they gather, the more inexhaustible the medicinal substances become? How could they know that the mountains, rivers, and great earth, along with the dull and the sentient, constantly tend the fire without pause, and that the more the fire is tended, the more it does not rest?

Only this fire-tending and these medicinal substances—follow them and you remain mortal; reverse them and you become a sage. As the ancient saying goes: *"When the Five Phases are inverted, the great earth yields its seven treasures; when the Five Phases flow in order, the dharma-realm becomes a fiery pit."* Such is the principle.

The former masters Master Niyuan and Perfected One Cuixu emerged from the lineage of the Venerable Master Piling, Master Xue. Yet the thread of Piling’s transmission truly originated with the Venerable Master Xinglin, Master Shi. Master Shi inherited the Dao of Ancestral Master Ziyang. Viewing the single transmission of today, one might say that the nightlong dream of Xihua at Tiantai in former times was nothing other than a blessing for later generations—a boon to the myriad spirits.

In recent years, Master Niyuan led me to the immortal cavern of Huodong, where we burned incense and bowed reverently. The ancestral masters Xinglin and Piling responded to our fervent invocations, touching our bodies and grasping our ears to return with us, deepening our resolve to embrace the feminine and hold fast to the One. When I arrived at Wuyi and met Ma Ziran, he spoke earnestly, presenting a sacred scroll of four hundred words. Each character was a healing stone; gazing upon it, I recognized the nurturing love, as sweet dew bathed my heart, and my very bones and marrow felt suddenly clear.

Since the wondrous Dao has become manifest, I have long dwelled at Zhiti. Now, as he prepares to depart like an infant torn from its mother, he wishes to visit Qingcheng Mountain. Passing by chance through Shiwu Cavern, I was moved to send this brief letter. Here, I have described only the essence of the great elixir of golden cinnabar. As for the mechanism of the plantain flower in spring wind, the secret of the parasol tree in autumn rain, the midnight moon over the emerald pool, and the evening clouds above the green mountains—such profound mysteries dare not be openly revealed, for they pertain to the celestial workings.

Has the ancestral master nodded in approval?

The three masters—Xinglin, Piling, and Niyuan—must now soar like cranes on paired wings. Ashamed that the path of immortals and mortals remains divided, I wonder when my work of refinement will be complete, when I may ride the spirit and command the qi, to stand beneath their soaring sandals and serve in the calling of phoenixes and cranes. As I write, my longing overflows, tears staining the brush, leaving me disoriented and at a loss.

I humbly beseech you to send a purple raft or ascend a cinnabar ladder, to store up golden sand and extend your hand to the multitude of creatures. I dare not elaborate further.

**A Letter in Gratitude to the Immortal Master**

The golden elixir is forged by gathering the medicine of two eights and nurturing the embryo for three hundred days. The work of the heart lies not in swallowing saliva or inhaling qi; the primordial creation requires gathering qi and congealing spirit. To practice this, one must rely on oral instructions—utterly simple, utterly easy, neither form nor emptiness.

Within the formless, nurture the infant; within yin, refine yang qi. Let the Metal Lord capture the living tiger; let the Maiden of Cinnabar ride the crimson dragon alone. The Heavenly Husband and Earthly Wife, with the Yellow Dame as matchmaker; the Maiden of Li and the Lad of Kan, uniting to form the crimson child. A single furnace’s flame refines emptiness into motes of dust; a vast ice-pot reflects the world as a grain of millet.

When spirit returns to the four great elements, it is the moment of the tortoise and serpent’s union; when qi enters the four limbs, it is the place where the crow and hare gather. The jade gourd yields golden liquid; the golden sprout blossoms into a white jade flower. At the hour when wind chimes tinkle and the moon shines bright—who grasps the meaning of green mountains and flowing waters?

The sagely masters, mouth to mouth, have transmitted this through the ages, heart to heart. Even if one were to thread together ten thousand immortal classics, a single moment’s work brings boundless ease. First, clarify the Three-Five-One, and refine it with the true fire of the nine yangs. Later, when it reaches ten thousand, a hundred, a thousand, the infant’s treasure is complete.

A mountain of silver, a wall of iron—a single thrust of the awl pierces the golden lock and jade gate, and each step becomes naturally unimpeded. One sees a realm of ten thousand miles without a speck of dust and becomes a person of a thousand years, never to die. The seas turn to mulberry fields, yet I wander in carefree realms; my robe wears away the stone of kalpas, and together we return to the land of Nothing Whatsoever.

The white toad’s original vow remains unfulfilled, my initial sincerity and past reverence unshaken. I sigh at my reed-like nature, now nearing the twilight years. Yet my aged cheeks still flush red, as if destined for immortality; my youthful beard darkens again, returning at last to the source of virtue and the Dao.

I lament that the ancients spoke of sixty-four as the age of retirement, yet I have received the eighty-one chapters of the former sages to enjoy. My village breast weeps tears; I seal my lips and press my hand to my heart. All my past efforts and labors were like grasping at shadows—today, in the realm of the formless, the alchemical method turns iron into gold.

I revere the sagely masters Niyuan Nie and Perfected One Cuixu—heroes of the age, with the skill to mend the heavens. Their hearts transmit the profound intent of clouds and rain; their hands wield the mighty power of thunder. I, Yu Chan, am indebted to three generations of masters, awaiting the true chariot for a thousand years. I spoke of the medicinal spoon on an autumn evening in *guiyou*, and exhausted the workings of Kan and Li in the spring rains of *yihai*.

**Eight Treasures for the World to Inherit**
*By Xu Zhenjun of West Mountain*

**Song of the Drunken Immortal**

**Eight Treasures for the World to Inherit**

The Jade Emperor assigns immortal ranks;
Dragons spew dew as phoenixes lend their might.
In an instant, one surveys the lands of Hua and Yi—
Yet the immortal flower remains unseen, its seeker unknown.

I ascend the Great Canopy to gaze upon the world,
Which lies like a hand’s palm before me.
Had I not been hastening toward ascension,
I would have borne all to Yingzhou’s isles.

If this elixir were made the cinnabar field,
In a year or two of the crow and hare’s dance,
The divine water would dry, sprouting branches ten thousand *zhang*—
And you would know your body already belongs to the immortals.

*Drunken Immortal’s Thoughts, Drunken Immortal’s Thoughts,*
Idle, I visit the grotto-heavens without cause.
Since the simurgh and phoenix parted, seasons have passed;
Long since have I ridden the crimson dragon to plow the skies.

Clouds yearn for isles, cranes for the heavens—
All things arise from nature’s own source.
At the Flowery Pond, we drink, faces like jade;
Leaping with golden essence, cheeks bloom like lotus.

The spirit yearns for the wondrous, *qi* for the primordial;
The Dao’s creation in non-action defies speech.
In the Tower of the Dark Pearl, white jade is gathered;
Within the Palace of Water Essence, red lotus is plucked.

Lead yearns for mercury, mercury for lead—
Seizing heaven and earth’s power of creation.
Life and destiny reduce to two words,
Yet hide within ten thousand scrolls of immortal scripture.

Heaven yearns for earth, earth for heaven—
Heaven and earth embrace the ten thousand forms.
When the hen broods her eggs, the sun must be full;
How many perceive the *you* within *wu*?

Water yearns for the sea, the sea for its source—
Breaking through the Ox and Dipper, the cycle must turn.
The jade armillary and the turning sphere follow their course;
Who can guide them into the *niwan*?

The heart yearns for the subtle, the mind for the mysterious—
At the navel, primordial *qi* coalesces into the elixir.
The Valley Spirit does not die, for it breathes as an embryo;
The gate of longevity demands unbroken continuity.

At dawn, think of the Dao; at dusk, of immortals—
In secret practice, the hidden *yin*, the myriad spirits find peace.
Within, the true *qi* harmonizes with breath;
Nature’s creation restores the youthful face.

Always think of good, never of grievance—
Good and evil stand clear before your eyes.
The family that accumulates goodness ascends to heaven;
Those who heap evil drift at the bitter sea’s edge.

In stillness, think of wisdom; in motion, of worth—
Without merit and conduct, how can the teaching be lightly passed?
The *Pure Yang* treatise speaks plainly:
To transmit a single method to one person is no easy task.

I thank the Emperor Above and the immortals,
Whose secret mysteries lift one from the mortal coil.
In the Hall of the Three Pure Ones, incense is added;
Daily, a pure breeze sweeps the ancient altar.

The cypress, tender and supple, coils like a dragon;
The withered wutong cannot mend a broken zither.
Wisteria vines spread into a canopy of blossoms;
The jade’s laughter bears not a single flaw.

On the ridge, mist and clouds surge in the wind;
Before the grotto, flowing water murmurs.
A long laugh pierces the clear clouds and the Han;
The *Steps of Emptiness* hymn resounds on Jade Capital Mountain.

Dragons chant, phoenixes dance amid crimson clouds;
Tigers roar, gibbons cry within purple mists.
When the Azure Dragon reaches the pass, Xu Jia releases it;
As the White Tiger ascends the west, Yin Xi watches.

The master chants the *Dao and Virtue*, teaching enlightenment;
The alchemical classics must be passed mouth to mouth.
When will the craving for fame and profit ever end?
Better to drink wine, embrace the zither, and sleep.

On a fine night when the moon stands at midnight,
Again I hear the master’s three or five words of instruction.
To idle away a day is to have one less day;
To pass a year is to have one less year.

Can the fleeting waves and drifting foam endure?
Can fire pressed from stone be called firm?
The dragon must meet the pearl to shed its bones;
The cicada transforms by drinking dew.

The crane, with its crimson crown, lives three thousand years;
The tortoise, drinking from the pearl pond, knows no count of years.
The dew’s nectar, brewed, is offered for others to drink;
The immortal’s herbs are ever served to wandering guests.

All things return to their root and restore their mandate—
Yet those who study the Dao but do not refine the elixir?
The rain on the plantain startles the immortal’s dream;
Awakening, the sea has turned to mulberry fields.

Human life is an illusion, like a spring dream;
Life and destiny vanish in an instant, like the wind.
The dog licks the tripod and transforms with the dragon;
The chicken seizes the great medicine and becomes a simurgh.

Choose a blessed land, select a famed mountain—
In non-action and purity, the heart finds leisure.
Talismans and jade tablets summon gods and ghosts;
The sword’s light, like the Ox Star, gleams coldly.

The cold furnace hangs; the ancient mirror is observed—
New fire and dark frost fill the crucible, transmuting into red lotus.
When refining the great medicine, nine cycles are required;
The numinous cinnabar, nurtured, awaits three years.

The immortal’s secret lies in scruples of weight;
Withdrawal and bathing immerse one in the cold spring.
A single grain seizes the lifespan of heaven and earth;
Death and life, life and death, hold no sway.

When the elixir is complete, the will soars to the heavens;
Only the secret formula remains among mortals.
Suddenly awakened, I depart for the Drunken Immortal’s Isle;
The grotto door is ajar, a young attendant watches.

When the simurgh and crane arrive, they ascend in purple mist;
The Jade Emperor’s kalpa opens the immortal’s path.
The Nine Ancestors and Seven Generations all ascend to heaven;
Even kin and household are lifted in full.

Clad in six *zhu* of silk, crowned with a jade pin,
Feet tread ascending clouds at every step.
A thousand years of silk and bamboo music pierce the clouds;
Rainbow melodies fill the dance of simurghs and cranes.

I ascend to the Three Pure Ones to thank the Holy Mother;
Long have I dwelt among mortals, enduring cold and heat.
Comparing merit and conduct to true suchness,
My name is already recorded in the immortal’s register.

**The Elixir Song of Zhongli and Lü**
Knowing you possess a spirit of heroic bone,
I teach you in this state of rapture.
In the Hall of Embracing the Primordial, the Crystal Palace,
I clearly point to the immortal’s cave.

O great man, when you encounter the true formula,
You must hold fast with a fierce and unyielding heart.
The Five Agents pair naturally through the medicinal spoon;
Grasp the inverted secret of the tortoise and snake.

The Three Corpses must be subdued;
Advance and retreat by the celestial mechanism of the Six Jia.
Know the Three Essentials, and the myriad spirits will return;
Come, riding the fire dragon, departing the Nine Gates.

When the nine nines of the Dao are complete, the day of true perfection arrives;
At the celestial festival, the Three Pure Ones and Four Sovereigns pay homage.
*Qi* soars, the spirit’s enclosure blazes—
Penglai is but my family’s dwelling.

The assembled immortals feast in joyful clamor;
Twin youths lead the guest of the Primordial Audience.
The Dao-heart does not retreat, so I transmit it to you;
We swear an oath, our blood mingled in pledge.

Do not speak of it recklessly to others;
Do not reveal it needlessly to friends.
Do not fault me for repeating these words—
To treat it lightly will surely diminish your hidden merit.

As we clasp hands in parting, what is your intent?
Today I take leave of you and compose this song.
Though I have expounded a thousand wondrous principles,
Will your heart truly believe?

After midnight, I speak clearly to you:
Cherish my words, and ascend to the Great Canopy.

**Songs of the Elixir Marrow, Thirty-Four Chapters by Xue Dao**

**I**
To refine the elixir, seek not the winter solstice—
Within the body, a single *yang* stirs of itself.
The dragon soars over the Crimson Waters, waves surging;
The tiger roars on Cinnabar Mountain, wind and dew pure.

**II**
At first, it is like clouds emerging from a cave;
Then, like the moon resting in a pool.
Again, like a golden silkworm’s jade-like laughter—
Refine it well with the fire’s timing, thrice thrice.

**III**
Lovely as Xi Shi departing the golden pavilion,
Fair as Chang’e descending the jade tower.
Day by day, drunk with you beneath the blossoms—
Where is there not grace and charm?

**IV**
The mud-serpent in the well dances the *tuozhi*;
The bright moon at the window illumines plum and pear.
When night comes and *hundun* shatters to the earth,
The ten thousand images and all phenomena know nothing.

**V**
Long ago, the master’s oral transmission taught me:
Only gather the spirit and enter the *qi*-cavern.
Transform essence into *qi*, nourish *qi* with spirit,
Refine them into yellow sprouts and white snow.

**VI**
For a year, bathe and guard against peril;
For ten months, harmonize and tend with care.
Having ingested cinnabar, ascend to the Jade Emperor—
Ride the clouds, mount the crane, and enter the celestial gate.

**VII**
The crow casts no shadow, the hare has no form.
Crow and hare are but the essence of sun and moon—
When crow and hare unite, heaven and earth endure.

**VIII**
The ox has no horns, the horse has no hooves.

**IX**
Horse and ox are but the marrow of Heaven and Earth;
Heaven and Earth operate through *kan* and *li*.

**X**
The tortoise has no image, the snake leaves no trace.
Tortoise and snake are but the forms of yin and yang—
When the two *qi* unite, they merge as one.

**XI**
The dragon has no wings, the tiger has no fangs.
Dragon and tiger were originally of the same body;
Bind the neighbor, and it is immediately the western house.

**XII**
Lead is not lead, mercury is not mercury.
Lead and mercury are originally sought within the body—
Require the body and mind to be still and unmoving.

**XIII**
No white snow, no yellow sprouts.
White snow is the water of the spirit-chamber;
Yellow sprouts are the flower of the *qi*-pivot.

**XIV**
True husband, true wife.
When *kan*-man and *li*-woman unite in resonance,
Empty space is without dust, and heaven and earth are revealed.

**XV**
True crab-apple, true fire-date.
After eating the crab-apple, the four limbs grow light;
When the fire-date is swallowed, ten thousand kalpas are sated.

**XVI**
After the summer solstice, before the winter solstice,
Yin and yang are not to be sought here—
The divine *qi* naturally divides into the two arcs.

**XVII**
True water, true fire.
Follow the former signs and revolve the celestial circuit;
Harmonize and refine them to the end, the treasure of immortality.

**XVIII**
The sun’s soul, the moon’s spirit—
Within the body, the true Heaven and Earth reside;
Refine the elixir until it glows red and permeates all.

**XIX**
Heaven’s honor, Earth’s humility—
Seize the celestial soul to capture the six thieves,
And subdue the earthly spirit to restrain the three corpses.

**XX**
The medicine is not a thing, the fire is not a season.
Clearly, it is but a single spark of yang—
Refined into ten thousand kalpas of boundless endurance.

**XXI**
Metal is not *dui*, wood is not *zhen*.
From of old, true earth responds to the five phases;
Metal and wood naturally resolve their union.

**XXII**
Black within black, white within white—
Only by guarding the black will the white appear.
Black and white were originally not two colors.

**XXIII**
True gold, true silver.
Gold and silver refined into the purple-gold elixir—
Naturally, not a single chisel mark remains.

**XXIV**
The crescent-moon furnace, the cinnabar tripod.
Know that one must embrace the One and guard harmony;
No need to penetrate the passes or draw from the jade well.

**XXV**
The central cauldron, the One-guarding altar.
Keep the golden tripod’s broth ever warm;
Let not the jade furnace’s fire grow cold.

**XXVI**
Mysterious and true, the female and true.
Mysterious and female all converge in a single aperture—
Not in the mouth or nose, nor in the heart or kidneys.

**XXVII**
True divine water, true flowery pond.
The primal *qi* is empty and formless, hard to grasp;
The primal *qi* is vast and indistinct, fundamentally without action.

**XXVIII**
Refine cinnabar, refine mercury.
True cinnabar dies to yield mercury;
Mercury refined becomes the dust of the bright window.

**XXIX**
True yellow powder, true purple powder—
Clearly, within the inner tripod and inner furnace,
Transforming tiles and stones into the nine revolutions.

**XXX**
True iron lock, true river chariot.
The iron lock and golden pass are firmly guarded;
The river chariot’s operation congeals the elixir-sand.

**XXXI**
True gold essence, true jade liquid.
When the golden essence fills the tripod, *qi* returns to the root;
When the jade liquid brims the vessel, spirit enters the chamber.

**XXXII**
True gold elder, true old woman.
Gold elder and old woman wed in kinship—
In the depths of the bridal chamber, true clouds and rain.

**XXXIII**
True *ding*-elder, true yellow matron.
The *ding*-elder moves the fire to refine the golden flower;
The yellow matron nurtures the golden goose within the bottle.

**XXXIV**
True infant, true red child.
Nine revolutions refine it into a ten-month embryo—
Pure yang without yin, life never dies.

**XXXV**
True yin-yang, true yin-yang.
Yin and yang are but two words,
Yet they illustrate the elixir texts of myriad chapters.

**Postscript**
Those who refine the golden elixir must know:
The winter solstice is not at the *zi* hour, nor is bathing at *mao* or *you*.
Lead and mercury are neither saliva, nor essence, nor *qi*, nor blood, nor fluid.

The seven returns are the return to the root;
The nine refinements are the restoration of the source.
When gold essence and wood liquid meet earth, they unite—
Dragon, tiger, horse, and ox are all without form.

The former master’s *Wuzhen Pian* states:
The essence of the golden elixir lies in the divine water and flowery pond—
That is, lead and mercury.
If one knows the source of lead, then one knows where mercury is produced.
Once lead and mercury are known, then the divine water and flowery pond are known.
Once the divine water and flowery pond are known, then the golden elixir may be refined.
The golden elixir’s work is accomplished in an instant—
Do not cling to the nine-year, three-year timeline,
Nor rigidly adhere to years, months, days, or hours in its operation.

Zhongli Quan said:
The four great elements of the body all belong to yin.
Thus, one cannot seek within the body—
One may only pursue the single spark of yang essence within.
Yet this yang essence resides in an aperture,
Which ordinary people cannot fathom.
This single aperture is the gate of the mysterious female,
The very flowery pond of spirit.
Knowing this, one may then gather and refine,
Then unite and congeal, then refine and bathe,
And finally nurture to form the elixir.
How can the elixir be completed without discerning the source,
Knowing the weight, or recognizing the time?

Since receiving the master’s transmission,
I have known this body cannot die,
And that this elixir must be achieved.
Now that the great work is underway,
I proclaim this to all future seekers of immortality.

*Song of Guarding Life* by Master Shuxi of the Western Mountains

In this world, tales abound of those who consume elixirs or feast on immortal fruits to ascend in broad daylight—yet such wonders remain unseen. As for the arts of cultivating qi, they closely align with the Way of nurturing life. Humans are born with qi and blood, and as the *Treatise on Nurturing Life* states: "The essence of nurturing life lies in removing what harms it." This is a clear truth.

The *Song of Dispelling Illness* I have compiled distills the essentials of nurturing life from various schools. Those who follow it shall attain peace and joy; if its profound subtleties are fully realized, longevity may also be within reach.

The song says:
Of all things, humans are most noble,
A hundred years of life but a fleeting sojourn.
Without intent to cultivate and nurture,
Illness and suffering shall weigh upon the heart.

Examine your diet and desires,
Remove excesses to find ease.
Why chase cloud-gazing or alchemical pills,
Falsely seeking to extend life like tortoises or cranes?

After eating, walk a hundred steps at a leisurely pace,
Rub your hands together and massage your abdomen.
Then turn your hands to stroke the kidneys,
This is called "moving Water and Earth."

Look up and exhale three or four times,
Naturally dispelling the toxins of food.
Drunken slumber and overfull reclining bring no benefit,
While excessive thirst or hunger must also be avoided.

Do not eat too coarsely or hastily,
Better to eat lightly in succession.
A single heavy meal to fill the stomach
Harms the qi and injures the spleen—no blessing for you.

Avoid raw, tough, or greasy foods,
As well as the flesh of dead or trapped animals.
Steamed buns obstruct the qi and are unfit,
Raw fish readily invite spleen and stomach ailments.

Fresh sauces, fertilized eggs, and oily foods,
Along with aged, spoiled, or pickled items, all belong to the yin category.
The elderly and infirm should not consume them,
For it is no different from inviting bandits to arm themselves.

Grilled and roasted foods should be eaten sparingly,
Lest they harm the teeth and damage the blood vessels.
Dine before the hours of *shen* and *you*,
For late-night eating burdens the stomach and diaphragm.

*Note: The spleen delights in music; eating at night prevents the spleen’s qi from grinding, as the sounds of music cease. The* Rites of Zhou *states: "Music accompanies meals," for the spleen rejoices in the sounds of strings and bamboo. At the first note, the spleen begins to grind. Thus, all sounds originate from the spleen. In summer, when nights are short, this is especially to be avoided, lest digestion falter.*

Do not drink to the point of drunkenness,
For excess harms the spirit and impairs the mind.
When thirsty, drink water or tea,
Yet this may cause swelling in the waist and legs.

*Note: While wine can gladden the temperament and circulate the blood, it naturally invites wind and harms the kidneys, rotting the intestines and corroding the knees—nothing is more damaging. After a full meal, it is especially to be avoided. Drink slowly, lest you injure the lungs. The lungs are the bloom of the five viscera and must not be harmed. When wine has not yet worn off and thirst is great, avoid drinking water or tea, for the wine will draw them into the kidneys, creating stagnant toxic water. This leads to heavy, aching legs, cold pain in the bladder, and ailments like edema, wasting-thirst, and spasms.*

*Generally, tea is not to be consumed in any season, as it chills the lower burner. Only after a meal may one or two cups be taken without harm, for it aids digestion. When hungry, it is especially to be avoided.*

I have often heard: "Avoid wind as you would an arrow."
In sitting or lying, take care to guard against harm.
After drinking, the pores open,
And the slightest breeze may cause paralysis.

*Note: If you sense wind while sitting outdoors, avoid it promptly—do not endure it. The elderly, whose bodies are depleted and defenses weak, are easily invaded by wind. At first, they may not notice, but over time, it harms them. Thus, even in summer, do not seek coolness in the wind or fan yourself while drunk. There was once a man who learned the Way of longevity from Peng Zu but suffered from chronic headaches. Peng Zu examined his sleeping quarters and found a hole directly above his head. He promptly had it sealed, and the ailment vanished.*

Warm wine in all seasons,
For if it is too hot, it will be hard to drink.
Excess of any of the five flavors harms the body,
Lest they bring misfortune to the organs.

*Note: A moderate amount of the five flavors refreshes, but excess harms the corresponding organs. Too much sourness injures the spleen, too much pungency harms the liver, too much salt damages the heart, too much bitterness injures the lungs, and too much sweetness harms the kidneys. This is the natural principle of the Five Phases. At first, the harm is imperceptible, but over time, it becomes chronic.*

Do not engage in prolonged seeing, hearing, walking, or sitting,
For the five labors and seven injuries arise from this.

*Note: Prolonged seeing harms the heart and depletes the blood; prolonged sitting injures the spleen and wastes the flesh; prolonged exposure harms the lungs and depletes the qi; prolonged walking injures the liver and damages the sinews; prolonged standing harms the kidneys and weakens the bones. This is why Confucius said: "Move when it is time to move, sit when it is time to sit."*

The limbs should be gently exercised,
Like a door hinge that never rusts.

*Note: Fatigue may arise from inactivity. Do not always carry heavy burdens or grasp light objects, idling away the days. Yet it is the idle who often suffer from this ailment. Those who live in leisure do not exert themselves, and after eating, they sit outdoors. Their meridians become blocked, and their blood stagnates—this is the cause. Thus, the noble appear at ease but labor in mind, while the humble are carefree in heart but toil in body.*

The noble, indulging in untimely desires or unaware of taboos, may feast on delicacies before lying down outdoors—thus, they must engage in physical exertion, though not to the point of exhaustion. What matters is that *rong* and *wei* circulate freely, blood and vessels flow smoothly, like running water that never stagnates or a door hinge that never rusts. Outdoors, do not loathe stretching and relaxing; after a full meal, bathe; when hungry, comb your hair. Frequent combing and infrequent bathing benefit the heart and eyes; silent rest and dim sleep keep the spirit serene.

*Note: Lying on one’s side with knees bent strengthens the heart and qi. Upon waking, stretch fully to preserve the spirit. Stretching outdoors may invite demons and spirits—Confucius did not sleep like a corpse, and this is likely why. Frequent combing dispels wind and brightens the eyes, so Daoists comb their hair one hundred and twenty times each morning. Excessive bathing harms the heart and abdomen, causing fatigue. One should not speak while lying down, for the five viscera are like bells and chimes—unsuspended, they cannot sound. Sleeping with a lamp or candle disturbs the spirit.*

Of the four seasons, summer is the most difficult to manage, for *yin* lies hidden within, and the abdomen grows cold. Tonics for the kidneys and intestines must not be lacking, and cold foods should be avoided. *Note: Summer is the season when one’s essence and spirit are depleted. The heart flourishes while the kidneys wane, their essence transforming into water, which only congeals in autumn and hardens by winter—thus, one must be especially vigilant. In summer, regardless of age, all should consume warming foods; by autumn, this prevents cholera and vomiting. A consistently warm abdomen keeps all illnesses at bay, for robust blood and qi naturally resist disease. When the heart flourishes and the kidneys wane, what must one avoid? Above all, avoid draining the essence and qi. Sleeping quarters should be secluded and quiet, with tranquil repose and a harmonious mind.*

*Note: The "Monthly Commands" for mid-summer decree that the noble fast, dwell in stillness, cover their bodies, and avoid restlessness; they must abstain from music and sensuality, moderate their diet, and refrain from indulgence to calm the heart and qi. Bathing, washing, and rinsing should all be done with warm water. Even in sweltering heat, washing the face or hands with cold water dries the five viscera, depleting their fluids—how much worse is bathing? Pillows made of cold materials severely harm the eyes. Melons, raw vegetables, and uncooked greens should not be eaten—not only do they cause autumnal malaria and dysentery.*

*Note: Raw vegetables are inherently cold; melons may regulate qi but dull the ears and eyes. Donkeys and horses that eat them go blind the same day. Such foods should generally be avoided in all seasons, not just summer, and the elderly must be especially cautious.*

When *yang* lies hidden within during the three winter months, take care not to sweat excessively, lest the *yang* qi be drained. *Note: Heaven and earth are closed, blood and qi are stored—even if ill, one should not induce sweating. Do not travel far in misty conditions or linger in violent storms and thunder. Note: Once, three men ventured out early in the fog—one fasting, one having eaten porridge, and one having drunk wine. The fasting man died, the porridge-eater fell ill, and the wine-drinker remained healthy, for wine repels frost, dew, and malevolent qi. If you suddenly encounter whirlwinds, thunder, or dark mists on the road, seek shelter indoors; otherwise, you will be harmed. The damage may not be apparent at first, but over time, it will manifest as illness.*

The Daoists have further principles for nurturing life, the foremost being to restrain one’s will. In autumn and winter, dress only after sunrise; in spring and summer, rise at cock’s crow. *Note: Rise early in spring and summer, and sleep late in autumn and winter. Late rising should not extend past sunrise, and early rising should not precede cock’s crow. Awaken between midnight and dawn, close your eyes, and click your teeth thirty-four times. Inhale the new and exhale the old without error, then swallow the Jade Spring to nourish the embryo.*

*Note: The fluid in the mouth is called the "Flowery Pool" or "Jade Spring." The* Huangting Jing *states: "The Jade Spring’s pure water irrigates the numinous root; cultivate this, and your life will endure." Damo’s* Taixi Lun *says: "For ingestion, one should sit cross-legged facing east after midnight, exhale the old qi from the abdomen three or two times, then pause and gently inhale fresh qi through the nose. Beneath the tongue lie two cavities connected to the kidney orifices; press the tongue against the upper palate, hold the breath briefly, and saliva will flow. Rinse the mouth until full, then swallow slowly, allowing it to naturally irrigate the five viscera—this is called 'qi returning to the cinnabar field.' If midnight is missed, dawn will suffice; even midday is acceptable. The pillow should not be too high."*

Han Xijing lived to one hundred and twenty, yet remained robust, claiming that daily ingestion of the Jade Spring and thirty-four tooth-clicks—called "refining the essence"—was his secret. The Later Han adept Wang Zhen often rinsed his mouth with the Jade Spring beneath his tongue and swallowed it, calling it "embryonic breathing." Sun Simiao said: "Hair should be frequently combed, hands often rubbed over the face, teeth regularly clicked, saliva constantly swallowed, and qi refined with precision. These five practices are what the* Huangting Jing *means by: 'If you wish not to die, cultivate the Kunlun.'"*

Warm your palms by rubbing them and press them over your eyes—*Note: Do this thirty-four times to naturally clear obstructions from the eyes, dispel wind, and brighten the vision. No method surpasses this for supplementing kidney qi.* Then rub your forehead and face. *Note: Frequently wiping the forehead—called "cultivating the Heavenly Court"—twenty to thirty-four times from the hairline will naturally lend the face a lustrous glow. Those with dim vision should do this often.* Occasionally massage the sides of your nose with your middle fingers. *Note: Rub the sides of the nose twenty to thirty times until both inside and out are warm—this is called "irrigating the Central Peak to moisten the lungs."* Knead your ears and the corners of your eyes repeatedly. *Note: Kneading the ears means massaging the ear lobes. Do this without counting, for it is called "cultivating the city walls to supplement kidney qi and prevent deafness and tinnitus."*

Further dry-bathe the whole body in inquiry,
When pressing the meridians, twist both shoulders in turn.
Though wind-fatigue and all manner of qi afflictions arise,
What fear of waist and back once more stiffening and cramping?

*Note: Most people, when seated, should often press the thighs with both hands and twist the shoulders left and right dozens of times.*

The six healing sounds—xu, he, hu, xi, chui, and si—
Are the oral formulas for those who practice qi-cultivation.
If one can truly follow and apply them,
New and old illnesses alike may all be cured.

Though sensual pleasures are said to belong to youth,
A little restraint and moderation will prevent transgression.
Seal the essence, still the breath—best to learn this early,
Lest the feather-wrapped flame burn in the fire.

*Note: The ancients likened the affairs of sensual desire to holding the sun in an ice cup or storing fire in a feather bundle.*

If one’s conduct is ever upright and proper,
Neither coveting fame nor contending for profit,
Even if not all the hundred practices are fully observed,
The whole body will still be free of illness.

*Note: Laozi said, "Those who skillfully nurture life on land do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers—such is the aid of virtue and the Dao."*
