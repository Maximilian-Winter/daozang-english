**The Jade Emperor’s Absolution and Bestowal of Blessings Precious Repentance Sutra**
*Composed by Commander Xin Hanchen of the Thunderous Might Officials*

We, the registered Daoist officials, reverently kindle true incense and sincerely memorialize:
To the Scriptural Teaching Master, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Commencement;
To the Jade Emperor, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy;
To the Heavenly Worthy Who Disseminates the Sacred Teachings and Descends into Birth;
To the Jade Sovereign of the Ten Thousand Heavens, the August Thearch;
To the Sacred Father, the Heavenly Worthy of the King of Radiant Splendor and Wondrous Joy;
To the Sacred Mother, the August Lady of Precious Moonlight;
To the boundless true sages who attend the imperial audience and all the perfected immortals—

We humbly recall:
In the secluded abodes of the Mysterious Park, the Primordial One ascends the throne of radiant light;
Manifesting incarnations to assemble, the Jade Emperor expounds the sutra of his former conduct.

In times past, there was the King of Wondrous Joy, named Pure Virtue, and his queen, Precious Moonlight. Anxious over the lack of an heir, they commanded the Daoist clergy to offer prayers throughout the land. Half a year passed, yet their resolve never wavered. Moved by their devotion, the Supreme Dao Lord and the host of perfected beings arrived in a five-colored chariot, bearing an infant whose pores emitted light, transfiguring the palace halls. At the queen’s earnest entreaty, they bestowed the child as heir. Born with divine spirit, he grew in benevolence. The people sang of his Dao, and his transformative influence permeated all without effort. Having entrusted the kingdom to his ministers, he entered the mountains to cultivate the supreme Dao, practicing alchemy to heal the sick and aiding the state to save the people. First attaining the rank of Golden Immortal, he later ascended to become the Jade Emperor—a marvel unheard of in former times, beyond all praise.

We, having received boundless grace across kalpas and been transformed over countless lives, lament our foolish and deluded nature, which has accumulated grievous transgressions. How dare we not confess and repent, beseeching original absolution? Thus, in reverence to the sacred canons, we exert ourselves in remorseful reflection, praying to sever obstructions and dissolve transgressions, hoping to avert calamities and accumulate blessings. May our hearts’ desires be fulfilled, and may we realize sagehood and attain perfection.

As this repentance ritual is proclaimed, we first invoke the descent of the true immortals, humbly entreating their compassion, that we may attain spiritual communion.

We pray that the world may become like lapis lazuli, that the immortals may ride the nine-jeweled, golden-hued wheels converging in splendor, their ten-ornamented feathered canopies soaring aloft. May the divine winds play music, harmonizing with treasures, while flowers form canopies to cover all; may phoenixes sing and simurghs cry, dragons dance and qilins frolic, all wheeling and whirling at the celestial zenith. May they descend upon the mortal realm, bringing joy and celebration to gods and humans alike, and may our sins and faults be eradicated. Should our prayers be answered, what greater fortune could there be?

We, along with our disciples, prostrate ourselves in awe, gazing toward the celestial majesty, awaiting your descent with utmost reverence. Trembling with sincerity, we bow our heads to the ground, fixing our thoughts upon your august countenance, trusting in your radiant grace. In accordance with the scriptures, we recite the gāthā spoken by the Lord of the Highest Void and Luminous Heaven, to offer our praise:

*Golden Portal’s Mysterious Vault Lord,*
*Exalted Jade Emperor Supreme.*
*Wondrous form crowns all heavens,*
*Compassionate light illumines the Three Realms.*
*True sage, teacher of the wondrous Dao,*
*On whom gods and humans rely.*
*The Great Vehicle’s dharma words descend,*
*The True One points the way to the lost.*
*Virtue vast as empty space,*
*Praise and extolment never end.*

We, the registered Daoist officials, along with the disciples of the Great Dao, reverently bow again and memorialize the Three Clarities, the August Sages, the Jade Emperor the Supreme, the Imperial Father and Imperial Mother, the Most Sacred and Most Perfected, the Ten Directions and Three Realms, and all true numina.

We have heard that the sagely virtue is boundless, beyond all record or praise; the feelings of mortals, when moved, should exhaust all laudation. His wondrous vision and wondrous knowledge are peerless; his great compassion and great mercy inspire pity and mercy. Thus, following the scriptures, we recount his titles, hoping to align our thoughts with devotion.

Ten mighty names scarcely suffice to praise his ineffable title; seventeen lights, though exhaustive, cannot encompass his infinite radiance. Vast as "Heaven," yet Heaven cannot compare; ultimate as "Dao," yet all Dao emanates from him. Even the golden mouth could not exhaust his glory—how could the dusty world ever know it? We merely gather words from the scriptures to extol his sagely virtue.

We pray that uttering one good word may give rise to all virtues in the heart; that praising ten names may dissolve all sins recorded in the ledgers. May kindness, harmony, and humility grow ever greater; may wisdom and eloquence gradually attain perfection. Together with all sentient beings, may we realize the supreme Dao.

We, along with our disciples, prostrate ourselves in utmost sincerity, universally dedicating this to our departed ancestors, living kin, all beings in the dusty world, and the souls lost in the long night. With reverence, we take refuge and bow in faith.

We, with wholehearted devotion, prostrate ourselves and pay homage to the Jade Emperor, the Great Heavenly Worthy, the August Thearch of the Mysterious Vault.

We, with wholehearted devotion, prostrate ourselves and pay homage to the Jade Emperor, the Great Heavenly Worthy, the August Thearch of the Mysterious Vault, who wields the six spiritual powers, with all joining in praise.

*(Each line of the celestial titles below is followed by the assembly’s response of "Heavenly Worthy" and a bow.)*

We, with wholehearted devotion, prostrate ourselves and pay homage to the One who radiates great light in the White Jade Capital.

Exalted Heavenly Saint, Great Being of Mercy.
Ten Titles fulfilled, myriad virtues embodied.
Delivering countless beings, rescuing from the suffering of birth and death.

With devoted hearts, we prostrate and offer homage to the Most High and Boundless Heaven, the Wondrous Realm of Mysterious Reality, the Vast and Resplendent Purple-Golden Palace, the Grand Jade Clarity Palace of the Great Subtlety.
The Limitless and Supreme Saint, vast and luminous.
Still and boundless, without origin, the Mysterious Model encompassing the ten directions.
The Profoundly Still and Eternally Constant Dao, the Vast and Mighty Spiritual Power.
The August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sovereign of the Lofty Vault of Heaven.

We, the registered officials and disciples of the Great Dao, led by so-and-so, reverently bow and humbly submit this memorial to the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Divine Father and Divine Mother, the Most Sacred and Most True, the Lords of the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, and all true sovereigns.

We have heard that to embody the Dao and attain truth arises from few transgressions and errors;
while to pass from life into death stems from missteps in conduct.

When the nature is once indulged, transgressions accumulate more heavily than mountains and hills; when the heart once repents, sins dissolve and disperse like ice and snow. Thus, the luminous teachings of the fundamental scriptures and precepts make clear the karmic causes of sin and blessing—how dare we fail to awaken a heart of repentance, only to persist in indulging our nature? With utmost sincerity and earnestness, we humbly beseech Your sacred compassion. May the ten evils and five rebellions be dissolved through our prostrations; may the three karmas and six senses be cleansed through our praises. We dare not conceal or hide anything, but confess all fully and with utmost effort. May we be bathed in Your mercy, and may You grant us special pardon. We pray that the myriad sins of a thousand offenses vanish in an instant; that the faults accumulated over many lives and kalpas be extinguished before the Dao. May we, in all future existences, become beings without transgression, uniting with the Dao and truth, never far from the sages.

May this extend to our nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages, universally embracing the six paths and three realms of suffering, all sentient beings, and the boundless lower realms—may all rely on the great virtue of the August Jade Emperor to dissolve the deep karmic debts of vast kalpas. May we attain few transgressions and few errors, perfecting goodness and beauty in all things.

We, your humble servants and disciples, led by so-and-so, offer our most earnest prayers. Together with our departed ancestors, living kin, all beings of the dusty world, and the lost souls of the long night, we prostrate ourselves in utmost devotion, taking refuge and offering reverence.

With devoted hearts, we bow in homage to the August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sovereign of the Lofty Vault of Heaven.

With devoted hearts, we bow in homage, praying that each may clearly understand the karmic causes of sin and blessing.

After each invocation of the August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sovereign of the Lofty Vault of Heaven, the assembly responds with the sacred title and bows once.

May all evil karma be utterly dissolved.
May the five rebellions and ten evils be utterly dissolved.
May all wicked karma be utterly dissolved.
May those who believe in and turn toward this scripture be freed from evil.
May the boundless sacred teachings continuously deliver and uplift.
May the special grace of the exalted sages liberate us from hell.
May the dust-like evil karma dissolve as the heart wills.
May the sins of vast kalpas past be dissolved.
May the sins of indulging the nature of ignorance be dissolved.
May the sins of pervasive defilement by the six senses be dissolved.
May the sins of entanglement by the three karmas be dissolved.

May the sins of frivolous laughter and play be dissolved.
May the sins in hell be dissolved.
May the sins among hungry ghosts be dissolved.
May the sins among animals be dissolved.
May the sins in remote borderlands and foreign realms be dissolved.

With devoted hearts, we bow in homage to the Supreme Heaven of the Peerless and Most High.

The wondrous realm of Mysterious Truth,
The boundless Purple Gold Vault.
The Great Tenuity Jade Clarity Palace,
The Limitless and Most Supreme Sage.
Vast and luminous,
Still and boundless, without origin.
The Mysterious Model encompassing the ten directions,
The Profoundly Still and Eternally Constant Dao.
The Vast and Mighty Spiritual Power,
The August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sovereign of the Lofty Vault of Heaven.

We, the registered officials and disciples of the Great Dao, led by so-and-so, reverently bow and humbly submit this memorial to the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Divine Father and Divine Mother, the Most Sacred and Most True, the Lords of the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, and all true sovereigns.

We have heard that when obstructions remain unsevered, they cause blockage and delusion; when even one hindrance is removed, clarity and understanding arise.

When the dark haze disperses, the sun regains its clarity; when floating clouds scatter, the heavens shine with radiance. If not swept away, how can one avoid persistent obscuration? The heart has yet to merge with the sun and moon, so hindrances must be cleared like clouds and mist.

We look up to the Primordial Sage’s compassion and proclaim the wondrous Dharma of severing obstructions, that all dust may cease to arise and the true realm reveal itself. Yet how can deluded ordinary beings, failing to cultivate according to the Dharma, avoid following emotions and chasing after phenomena? How can they settle their thoughts and concentrate their spirit?

External demons disturb their supreme Dao, corrupt their spiritual roots, and steal their most precious treasure. Entangled in worldly nets, they sink into the common stream. Ten thousand demons assail them, and their singular truth is lost. Without the virtue of refinement and transformation, how can they achieve the merit of severing hindrances?

Following the wondrous scriptures in repentance, we seek to sweep away all obstructions. Thus, we humbly implore and earnestly beseech: may you bestow the sword of wisdom to sever and extinguish all afflictive hindrances. Sweep away the floating veils, that the radiance of the sun of wisdom may shine; brush aside the dust of toil, that the pearl of the heart may gleam with purity.

May our mortal forms be purified, the fruit of the Dao perfected, and both the hidden and manifest realms together recognize the singular luminous nature. May we forever escape transmigration and eternally attain freedom.

We, your disciples, led by so-and-so, prostrate ourselves in utmost devotion, reverently bowing and submitting this prayer for all—our departed ancestors, living kin, all beings of the dusty world, and the wandering souls of the long night.

With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sovereign of the Lofty Vault of Heaven.

With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage, each reciting the sacred title of the Heavenly Worthy and prostrating once, praying:
May no doubts arise,
May no greed or anger arise,
May no lust arise,
May no jealousy arise,
May no killing arise,
May no worldly attachments arise,
May no worldly thoughts arise,
May no dullness or filth arise,
May no attachment to sounds or forms arise,
May no right or wrong arise,
May no clinging to love arise,
May no discrimination arise,
May no arrogance arise,
May no attachment arise,
May thoughts be settled and the mind clear,
May the ten thousand spirits be subdued,
May the heart be as empty as space,
May inner and outer purity prevail,
May the body attain purity,
May all calamities be transcended,
May we behold the compassionate countenance,
May all be sheltered and delivered,
May all hear the wondrous Dharma,
May we personally make offerings,
May we forever escape transmigration,
May evil roots be severed,
May our names be recorded in the Mysterious Capital,
May all thoughts cease,
May the ten thousand conditions instantly still,
May delusions be cast aside,
May we uphold this scripture,
May nothing be excluded,
May nothing be rejected,
May external demons not disturb,
May the true source not be lost,
May the spiritual root not be corrupted,
May we not sink into the common stream,
May we not fall into worldly nets,
May the ten thousand demons not assail,
May we hear the true Dharma,
May habitual tendencies be relinquished,
May we cultivate all wondrous practices,
May we attain the gates of liberation,
May we share in pure faith,
May we share in pure understanding,
May we share in pure mindfulness,
May we share in pure conduct,
May we share in pure embodiment,
May we share in pure heart,
May we share in pure intention,
May we share in pure fruition,
May we share in pure retribution,
May we share in great compassion,
May we share in great mercy,
May we uphold the precepts with single-mindedness,
May we meditate deeply on the great Dao,
May we protect the true source,
May we honor and serve our parents,
May we reverently respect the Three Treasures,
May we exhaust loyalty to our sovereign,
May we refrain from killing or stealing,
May we refrain from lust or jealousy,
May we refrain from anger or hatred,
May we refrain from arrogance or deceit.

With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the Supreme Heaven of Grand Network, the Wondrous Existence of the Mysterious True Realm, the Vast and Luminous Purple Gold Portal, the Grand Tenuity Jade Purity Palace, the Boundless and Supreme Sage. Vast and luminous, still and boundless, without origin. The Mysterious Model encompassing the ten directions, the Profoundly Still and Eternally Constant Dao. The Vast and Mighty Spiritual Power, the August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sovereign of the Lofty Vault of Heaven.

*Recitation:*
The August Jade Emperor’s cultivation flourished in Fragrant Grove,
Radiating seventeenfold divine light.
To teach beings and remove obstructions,
The Dharma gate of True Oneness is widely proclaimed.

*Response:* The inconceivable merits are boundless.

We, the registered officials and disciples of the Great Dao, led by so-and-so, reverently bow and humbly submit this memorial to the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Divine Father and Divine Mother, the Most Sacred and Most True, the True Sovereigns of Heaven, Earth, Water, and Yang, and the Illuminated Lords of the Ten Directions.

We have heard that the formless and nameless alone stand supreme as the Dao; those with form and appearance cannot escape calamity. Even heaven and earth have their periods of closure and end, the sun and moon their eclipses. How much more so for humankind, each nurturing a mortal body? Unable to transcend fate or rise above conditions, we remain subject to the stars and bound to destiny. The thinness of predestined fortune, the weight of past karma—when dwellings turn adverse and times grow inauspicious, how can we avoid calamity? How can we escape misfortune?

Great disasters—floods, fires, bandits, and thieves—may escalate into illness, exile, the six extremes, the five declines, the seven harms, the eight difficulties, the three calamities, the four malevolent forces, the nine adversities, and the ten entanglements. When affliction befalls a nation, the nation cannot be at peace; when it strikes a year, the harvest cannot be bountiful. War, famine, displacement—having followed the teachings, we now repent and pray to avert these disasters.

May all be sheltered and delivered, all calamities dispelled. May predestined fate be reversed and past karma dissolved; may baleful stars retreat and adverse destinies be pacified. For the individual, residual misfortune may be quelled and crises averted; for the myriad beings, karmic retribution may be escaped and great disasters avoided. May we dwell securely in the dusty world, our actions ever meeting with fortune; may we reach the shore of the Dao, untouched by calamity. May we enjoy robust health, all beings live in peace, and heaven and earth endure forever.

We, your disciples, led by so-and-so, prostrate ourselves in utmost devotion, reverently bowing and submitting this prayer for all—our departed ancestors, living kin, all beings of the dusty world, and the wandering souls of the long night.

We, your disciples, with wholehearted devotion prostrate ourselves in reverence, bowing to the Jade Emperor, Great Heavenly Honored One, Mysterious Lofty High Sovereign. With each invocation of the sacred title of the Heavenly Honored One that follows, we bow once more in homage.

May all suffering and affliction be universally healed and liberation attained;
May mountain spirits guard and fierce beasts retreat of their own accord;
May winds and waves instantly subside and safe passage to the shore be granted;
May all evil bandits scatter and disperse;
May grievances be redressed and immediate release from bondage achieved;
May all malevolent spirits keep their distance and natural peace prevail;
May no calamity or misfortune draw near;
May all grave illnesses swiftly be cured;
May all malevolent ghosts and spirits vanish entirely;
May curses, hexes, and poisons dissolve of themselves;
May we reach the shore of the Dao untouched by calamity;
May life be preserved, disasters averted, and all inauspicious omens swept away;
May all demonic forces be naturally eradicated;
May the calamities of war and armed conflict be dispelled;
May the scourge of pestilence and plague be dispelled;
May the disasters of flood, drought, and locusts be dispelled;
May the misfortunes of famine and dearth be dispelled;
May the afflictions of all manner of malignant diseases be dispelled;
May the torments of scabies, leprosy, abscesses, and ulcers be dispelled;
May the sorrows of grief, sorrow, and distress be dispelled;
May the harms inflicted by wanton violence be dispelled;
May the miseries of imprisonment and shackles be dispelled;
May the tragedies of untimely and self-inflicted death be dispelled;
May the ravages of poison and toxins be dispelled;
May the dangers of tigers, wolves, insects, and serpents be dispelled;
May the entanglements of karmic debts be dispelled;
May the perils of encountering evil persons be dispelled;
May the horrors of slaughter and dismemberment be dispelled;
May the terrors of falling from cliffs be dispelled;
May the harms of malevolent spirits be dispelled;
May the devastations of water and fire be dispelled;
May the slaughter of warfare be dispelled;
May the tragedy of premature death be dispelled.

We, your disciples, with wholehearted devotion prostrate ourselves in reverence, bowing to the Supreme Peerless Heaven of the Great Ultimate. In the wondrous realm of Mysterious Reality, the distant Purple Gold Palace stands; the Jade Pure Palace of the Great Tenuity, where the Limitless and Supreme Sage dwells. Vast and luminous, its radiance shines; silent and boundless, it knows no origin. Its mysterious pattern encompasses the ten directions; its serene stillness is the true and constant Dao. Vast and unfathomable, its great spiritual power—Jade Emperor, Great Heavenly Honored One, Mysterious Lofty High Sovereign.

We, your registered officials and disciples, led by so-and-so, with utmost reverence and care, humbly present this memorial to the Three Pure Ones, the Most Supreme, the Jade Emperor, the Divine Father and Mother, the Most Sacred and True, the deities of Heaven, Earth, Water, and Yang, and all true numina.

We, your disciples, have heard that only when the power of virtue is lofty does the convergence of blessed affinity arise; only when wholesome thoughts reach maturity do auspicious signs appear. Without the witness of heaven and humanity, only the immortals’ disciples may inherit this truth. Yet we, having failed to accumulate the practices of true cultivation and long lacking a heart inclined toward the Dao, dare not refrain from supplication to seek your gracious bestowal. According to the wondrous sutras, recitation enables attainment; having already pledged devotion, we have begun to learn and recite. In the dual paths of sin and fortune, sin removed ensures fortune’s bestowal; in the two principles of calamity and auspiciousness, calamity dispelled ensures blessings stored. Having eradicated past sins, we are certain that future disasters will be averted. We trust in your compassion and mercy, which will surely heed our earnest pleas. Daring to express our reverent homage, we humbly await the descent of your exorcistic grace. With incense offered in earnest entreaty, we gaze toward your imperial benevolence.

We humbly pray that your virtue, profound and vast, and your grace, boundless and expansive, may widely bestow propitious winds to shelter all things, and benevolent moisture to bless every household with joy. May the Five Fortunes be conferred, bringing universal delight to all people; may the Hundred Auspices arrive, ensuring the flourishing of descendants. May the world ascend to the realm of benevolence and longevity, and may enduring blessings be enjoyed without end. As if dwelling beyond the dust, may we differ not from those within the mysterious. We, your disciples, led by so-and-so, prostrate ourselves in utmost devotion, reverently bowing and submitting this prayer for all—our departed ancestors, living kin, all beings of the dusty world, and the wandering souls of the long night.

We, your disciples, with wholehearted devotion prostrate ourselves in reverence, bowing to the Jade Emperor, Great Heavenly Honored One, Mysterious Lofty High Sovereign. With each subsequent invocation, as before, we chant the sacred title and bow once more.

May peace and joy prevail, and the divine wind spread afar;
May noble encounters and official promotions be granted;

May wealth and treasures overflow, and clothing and sustenance come naturally;
May blessings flow to descendants and be transmitted through generations;
May all inauspicious stars reverse and descend as auspicious signs;
May all desires and wishes of the heart be fulfilled;
May clothing and sustenance come naturally, and descendants be honored and noble;
May words spoken be rare and heard, and met with reverence wherever they reach;
May exalted rank and esteem illuminate and magnify one’s household;
May auspiciousness blaze brightly, and calamities and obstacles be kept at bay;
May the roots of the Dao run deep, and long-standing good affinities be present;
May the foundation of the Dao be firmly planted, and fields of blessings widely sown;
May all that is requested in the heart be granted in full;
May elixirs and wondrous treasures be freely taken as one wills.

We, your disciples, with wholehearted devotion prostrate ourselves in reverence, bowing to the Most Supreme Heaven of Maitreya, the Boundless Sky.

In the wondrous realm of Mysterious Reality,
The distant Purple Gold Towers stretch on;
The Great Tenuity Jade Clarity Palace,
The Boundless, Most Supreme Sage.
Vast and luminous, radiance unfolds,
Serene and silent, boundless in origin.
The Mysterious Model encompasses the ten directions,
The tranquil and still, true and constant Dao.
Vast and empty, great spiritual power,
The Jade Emperor, Great Heavenly Honored One, Mysterious Lofty High Sovereign.

We, the registered ministers led by so-and-so, and the disciples of the Great Dao, reverently and sincerely submit this memorial to the Three Clarities and Three Realms Heavenly Worthies, the Golden Watchtower Jade Emperor, the Divine Father and Divine Mother, the Most Sacred and Most Perfected, the Yang of Heaven, Earth, and Water, and all the sages of the ten directions. We humbly beseech your vast compassion to turn your luminous gaze upon us.

We, your disciples, have heard: among the many, none are without wishes, yet their wishes differ; each person has their own heart—how could all hearts be the same?

Those who have fallen desire to rise; the lowly long for nobility.
The poor seek wealth; the suffering crave peace.
Some aspire to realize the Dao and attain perfection;
others strive to aid the people and benefit all beings—
each has their own prayers.
How could there be those without wishes?
Yet only when their wishes are fulfilled will they find release.

We reverently recall that the wondrous Dao, in its boundless compassion,
can fulfill the aspirations of all beings.
Daring to present our supplications,
we humbly rely upon your luminous grace.

May you deign to regard the sentiments of mortals,
incline your celestial ear to our pleas,
respond to each according to their karmic conditions,
and grant their wishes as their hearts desire.
Whether for self or others,
whether for the hidden or the manifest,
may all attain fulfillment of their aspirations,
and may none see their wishes thwarted.

We, your ministers and disciples, together with all our heartfelt devotion,
along with our departed ancestors, living kin,
all beings in the dusty world, and the wandering souls of the long night,
prostrate ourselves in utmost sincerity, taking refuge and offering reverence.

With devoted hearts, we bow in homage to the Jade Emperor, Great Heavenly Honored One, Mysterious Lofty High Sovereign.

[With each subsequent line, as before, one bow is offered:]
May the world resound with songs of joy and the nation know great peace.
May the beings in hell be reborn in the heavenly realms.
May the sufferings of the three evil destinies be instantly dissolved.
May the Dharma be expounded for the ten directions.
May divine radiance shine forth, illuminating all realms.
May the six realms of existence and the four saintly states all partake of the Dao’s blessings.
May the assemblies of sages and worthies flourish throughout the heavens.
May the land be pure and the people content in their livelihoods.
May hostile invaders cease their incursions and border cities know no strife.
May the turning of the kalpa restore the true Dao to its rightful course.
May all that is withered and barren bloom anew with branches and leaves.
May those of short lifespan each attain longevity.
May the beings of the six destinies all receive deliverance.
May all heavenly beings forever cast off the five declines and four signs of decay,
and instead accumulate celestial blessings.
May kings, ministers, and the multitudes swiftly attain the joys of long life in heaven and among humans.
May those who pass away master the Dao of liberation through the dissolution of the body.
May all demonic forces dwell peacefully in the heavenly palaces,
and may the sufferings of war and strife find rest.
May all beings escape the torments of hell and attain the bliss of the Pure Land.
May all hungry ghosts be sated and freed from the pangs of hunger and thirst.
May all animals be released from their suffering and gain the joy of wisdom.

With devoted hearts, we bow in homage to the Supreme Mystery, the Boundless Wondrous Existence,
the Vast and Profound Realm of the Purple Gold Towers,
the Great Tenuity Jade Clarity Palace, the Peerless and Supreme Sage.
Vast and luminous, it shines forth in solitude;
still and silent, it knows no origin.
Its mysterious pattern encompasses the ten directions;
tranquil and constant, it is the true and eternal Dao.
Vast and empty, its great spiritual power,
the Jade Emperor, Great Heavenly Honored One, Mysterious Lofty High Sovereign.

We, the registered ministers led by so-and-so, and the disciples of the Great Dao,
reverently and sincerely submit this memorial to the Three Clarities and Three Realms Heavenly Worthies,
the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven,
the Divine Father and Divine Mother,
the Most Sacred and Most Perfected,
the Yang of Heaven, Earth, and Water,
and all the sages of the ten directions.
We humbly beseech your vast compassion to turn your luminous gaze upon us.

We, your disciples, have heard:
Without diligent seeking, how can one realize the Dao?
With steadfast cultivation, one may surely attain perfection.
Contemplating the scriptures of past conduct,
we honor those who uphold them.
Whoever reads these scriptures may be called a true person;
whoever delves into their mysteries will surely attain the fruition of immortality.
Having repeatedly entreated,
obstacles are severed and calamities dispelled.
When ultimate realization is achieved,
one enters the profound and attains the wondrous.

Thus, we offer our repentance and gratitude,
praying for completion and fulfillment.
May the qi of the Dao converge in abundance,
and celestial blessings be ever more firmly established.
May those sunk in death arise and their souls take flight,
wandering the sacred realms to hear the Dharma’s sound.
May our bodies dwell amidst the five-colored clouds,
our spirits roam the eight directions.
May a thousand spirits pay homage,
ten thousand deities submit in awe.
May the three realms provide escort,
the Five Emperors receive and welcome us.
May we not lose our human form,
and swiftly attain the true Dao.
Above, may it benefit the state and the royal house;
below, may it extend to all living beings.
May all enter the Dharma gate,
and together ascend the shore of the Dao.

We, your ministers and disciples, together with all our heartfelt devotion,
along with our departed ancestors, living kin,

to the Most High and Boundless Heaven of Mijian.
The wondrous existence of the mysterious and true realm,
the vast and distant Purple Gold Towers.
The Jade Pure Palace of the Great Tenuity,
the boundless and supreme Sage.
Expansive and luminous,
serene and vast without origin.
The mysterious model encompassing the ten directions,
the profound and tranquil true and eternal Dao.
Vast and unfathomable great spiritual penetrations,
the Jade Emperor, the Great Heavenly Honored One, the Lofty Emperor of the Mysterious Heavens.

We, the registered officials and disciples of the Great Dao, led by your servant [Name], with utmost sincerity and reverence,
humbly address our petition to the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms,
the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven,
the Divine Father and Divine Mother,
the Most Sacred and Most Perfected,
the Yang of Heaven, Earth, and Water,
the hosts of sagely and virtuous beings,
the responsive and perceptive ones of the ten directions,
and all true numina.
We earnestly beseech your vast compassion,
to turn your profound gaze upon us.

We, your humble servants, humbly pray that the Jade Emperor’s merit and virtue,
may powerfully save and deliver all sentient beings.
For the transgressions of ordinary mortals,
we deeply dare to seek refuge in your vast creation.
Having exhausted the power of our praises,
we now extend the sincerity of our repentance and gratitude.
We trust that, bathed in your compassion,
you will specially grant us forgiveness.
May the causes of sin and blessing be made clear;
may the roots of obstacles be entirely severed.
Preserve life and avert disaster,
prolong auspiciousness and gather blessings.
May the wishes of the heart be fulfilled,
and the path of cultivating the true Dao be accomplished.
Is this not the work of karmic conditions?
Truly, it is our great fortune.
We rely upon your protection from beginning to end,
and pray that our earnest supplications be made manifest.
No wish shall go unanswered,
every prayer shall be met with response.
May the heavens endure long and prosperous reigns,
may the nation know great peace and foes be subdued.
The nine dark realms shattered,
the eternal night illuminated.
The five blessings bestowed,
the myriad people sing in joy.
Ancestors ascend and attain deliverance,
kinfolk enjoy longevity and health.
Wealth and treasure overflow,
clothing and food arise naturally.
Descendants flourish in honor,
auspiciousness blazes in abundance.
The sprouts of goodness grow,
the fruits of the Dao ripen to perfection.
Together with all sentient beings,
may we universally partake of the sagely blessings.

We, your servants and disciples, with hearts full of earnest devotion,
prostrate ourselves in utmost reverence and awe,
kneeling and bowing our heads twice, humbly declare:

Great is the supreme Dao, the originless and highest Perfected.
Above, it delivers the heavens;
below, it succors the suffering souls.
Without teacher or ancestor,
only the Dao is its body.
The Cinnabar Terrace and Purple Mansion,
the Golden Towers and Jade Capital.
This wondrous Dharma is concealed,
yet its blessings extend to all beings.
Eradicate our myriad sins,
prolong our distant years.
The myriad spirits pay homage,
the demon kings welcome and protect.
Merit and virtue flourish,
names inscribed in the Yellow Register.
Through boundless eons,
may we endure forever.
