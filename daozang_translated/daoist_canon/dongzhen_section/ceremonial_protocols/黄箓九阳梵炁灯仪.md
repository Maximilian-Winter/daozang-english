**Ritual Procedure as Prescribed**

*Opening Invocation:*
With incense and offerings, I venerate the Supreme Great One, Taiye, Savior of Suffering; the Nine-Heaven Generative Deity; the Nine Solar Dao-Qi Heavenly Lord; the Nine-Earth Community Commanding Deity; the Nine Abysses of Hell and its Dark Officials; and all the Holy Assemblies who examine and govern the underworld.

I humbly submit that from the beginning of the cosmos, the Three Dao-Qi were concealed within the primordial void; that the divine radiance enfolds brilliance, and the Nine Lights were dispersed across the celestial extremes. When the Great Mass was divided, the Primordial Origin unfolded the diagram, bestowing divine resources and vital Dao-Qi in intricate networks. Beneath the earth, virtue flows, and above, the Dao is dispensed to guide all beings.

Thus, the Golden Talisman descended with its teachings, and the Cloud Scrolls elucidated the doctrine. Within the Purple Micro Celestial Chamber, the luminous void shines forth; above the Eastern Extremity’s Azure Mist, the transformations begin in the verdant heights. The original form bears its symbol, resplendent in all eight directions. Its scripture radiates with a brilliance of one *zhang*, its ninefold golden lattice concealed, its seven-treasure canopy dazzling.

The wondrous Dao-Qi coalesces, and the numinous winds resound with music. The altar officials, having received the summons, permit the invocation to proceed; the dark spirits, graced by this light, gain illumination and transformation.

Now, this officiant of the fast, [Name], clad in the Great Daoist Robe, bows respectfully to the Supreme Mystery. I pray for the Nine-Colored Solar Light to be bestowed, dispelling the heavy darkness of the abyssal prison.

I humbly pray that all ten thousand spirits may guard and assist, that the Six Ding (celestial messengers) may lead the way, that the seeds of good and evil may be separated, and that the being may return to the human world and align with the Dao. Thus, the rite proceeds without interruption, and infinite beings are liberated.

I bow in reverence and take refuge, extolling the merits and virtues.

**Lifting the Dao-Qi Lamp of the Eastern Direction:**
I solemnly ignite the divine lamp of the Eastern Dipper, dispersing the Imperial True Dao-Qi of the Primordial Origin—*Yihuan* (One Yellow Transformation)—to illuminate the Wind and Thunder Hell, thereby breaking the calamity of flying spears and drifting blades.

**Supreme Great One, Savior of Suffering:**

I humbly submit that the Sovereign emerged from the *Zhen* (Thunder) direction, and in the first year, virtue arose with His birth. All things take root in the East, dwelling in the lofty *Yi* (Jade) and receiving the sun’s favor. The Wood Element governs the Nine Dao-Qi, while the *Jizhu* (Seven Stars) constellation presides over seven celestial markers. Amidst the emerald forests, there is the Boy of Enlightenment; above the Azure Mist and Jade Gate, he faces the Old Man of the Beginning.

Now, this officiant of the fast, [Name], extracts and elevates the form and spirit of the deceased [Name], ascending to the Heavenly Realm and lighting the divine lamp. I offer the *Yuxian Wuli Tian Shengshen Baozhang* (The Boundless Treasure Talisman of the Heavenly Deity, Yuxian).

The assembly chants in harmony, and the Dao-Qi of the *Yihuan* (One Yellow Transformation) blends with the void’s essence, soaring through the dark and distant abyss. Extending boundless longevity, the spirit drifts far from its original path. The suffering soul sinks into the Nine Nights of darkness, yet at dawn, it yearns for the rising sun.

The Great Dao-Qi opens the Mysterious Gate, and Yuxian descends to the morning heavens. The Yellow Cloud condenses at the Soul Palace, where the Dao-Qi of yin and yang intermingle. The Primordial Origin forms the long life, and evil roots dissolve through transformation. The Peach Blossom’s vitality merges with essence, as the Two Sovereigns (Heaven and Earth) emit their jade-like radiance.

Nourishing the Primordial Gate, refining the spirit without decay, the Nine-Heaven Longevity Talisman is born, and the spirit transcends through divine decree. The Lord of Life seals the Gate of Death, while the Marshal of the Underworld recites the *Dongyao* (Cavernous Chant). With one invocation, all ten thousand beings respond in harmony; with nine recitations, the celestial realms assemble in reverence.

I bow in humility, celebrating this auspicious year. I pray that the wheel of transformation may spread its radiance, that the dragon’s mouth may descend its light, and that within the Three Realms, all beings may be liberated from suffering, ascend to eternal bliss, and universally attain the Great Vehicle.

After attaining the Dao, they rise into formlessness.

**Lifting the Dao-Qi Lamp of the Southeastern Direction:**
I solemnly ignite the divine lamp of the Southeastern Dipper, dispersing the Imperial True Dao-Qi of the Primordial Origin—*Changlingming Xian* (Long-Life Illuminating Immortal)—to illuminate the Copper Pillar Hell, thereby breaking the calamity of the body being consumed by fire and charcoal.

**Supreme Great One, Savior of Suffering:**

I humbly submit that within the Three Dao-Qi of the Heavenly Realm, the Red Sovereign is known as the Old One of Vermilion Vitality; within the Ninefold Solar Palace, the Jade Courtyard refines the flowing fire. At the moment when all things perceive each other, He preserves the boundless eons of existence. Following the call of His voice, He responds to the invocation, dividing His radiance as needed.

Now, this officiant of the fast, [Name], extracts and elevates the form and spirit of the deceased [Name], ascending to the Heavenly Realm and lighting the divine lamp. I offer the *Fangjian Xuyan Tian Shengshen Baozhang* (The Boundless Treasure Talisman of the Heavenly Deity, Dreaming of the Dao).

The assembly chants in harmony, and the Dao-Qi of the *Changlingming* (Long-Life Illuminating) blends with the void’s essence, opening the flying celestial expanse and solidifying the wheel within the luminous void. The roots of past affections depart, and the spirit reflects upon its original lineage. The distant night of suffering spans eons, yet through the Great Dao’s illumination, all is revealed.

The Imperial True Dao-Qi first refines the essence, known as *Ziyuan Yang* (Original Source Yang). The infant, like the Historian of the Dao, forms within the Yellow Chamber, guarding the embryo. Severing the roots of death, He nourishes the joyous infant. The *Shanshen* (Mountain and Heavenly) Dao-Qi guides the spirit, and the Mysterious Nectar ascends to the celestial fragrance.

The radiant scene reveals the jade-like quality, and the essence is refined into its true form. The Great Void responds to the numinous gathering, and the spirit is granted the divine decree. With one invocation, the Nine Mysteries are stirred; with two recitations, the heavens and earth resonate. The harmonious blending completes the transformation, and with nine recitations, the merit of all beings is fulfilled.

The Great Sage rejoices in the Primordial Auspiciousness, scattering flowers in homage to the Supreme Void. All the celestial realms exult in joy, and all bow in reverence.

I humbly pray that the Sovereign’s chariot may turn its light, that transformations follow each being’s nature. Sweeping away the Five Sufferings, they reach the Pure Abode of Eternal Bliss; extinguishing the Three Realms of Torment, they benefit from the Dao’s eternal splendor. Universally, all beings attain the Great Vehicle.

After attaining the Dao, they rise into formlessness.

**Lifting the Dao-Qi Lamp of the Southern Direction:**
I solemnly ignite the divine lamp of the Southern Dipper, dispersing the Imperial True Dao-Qi of the Primordial Origin—*Huoye Diyu* (Fire Shadow Hell)—to illuminate the Fire-Overshadowing Hell, thereby breaking the calamity of being devoured by flames and embers.

**Lifting the Dao-Qi Lamp of the Southern Direction (Continued):**

The multitude harmonizes and proclaims the scripture; the Three Illuminated Ones’ Dao-Qi—*Mustard Heaven’s*—dispenses the totality of the Three Clouds, and the Primordial Void-Qi divides itself. The Great Primordial Dao-Qi descends in splendor, its radiance like jade and its glory like emerald. The Dao-Qi of the Primordial Void ascends, opening the eternal night for the soul, and the wandering spirit returns to its appointed fate, its Dao-Qi restored to its original root.

The Great Emperor is named *Yangtang*, with the appellation *Eight-Spirit Lord*. The Nine-Pass Gate of the Returning Dao is traversed, and the Dao-Qi nurtures the Upper Primordial. The Primordial Dao-Qi records the soul’s passage, and the Supreme Unity aids the essence in its extension. The *Nihuan* (Earthly Pill) spreads across the Imperial Seat, and the Three Departments’ Eight Lands divide. The soul’s Dao-Qi is gathered and refined, and through nine transformations, it ascends to the Dao.

The resonant tones of the Nine Heavens echo, and the jade scriptures birth ten thousand spirits. Threefold cycles align the righteous ranks, and the Dao-Qi attends the Eight Celestial Gates. The Mystic Pass restrains the Gate of Death, and the Spirit-Post controls the *Jinyi* (Essential Fluid) source. In response to the gathered spirits’ number, the Dao’s splendor unfolds in hidden cycles.

Humbly, I celebrate this infant’s metamorphosis, bowing in reverence to the profound scriptures. I pray that ten million souls may receive illumination, refined with *Yuzhao* (Jade Unction); that the nine clans ascend together, granted with *Jinyi* (Golden Elixir). The Northern Palace extinguishes the Great Demon’s trial, and the Southern River restrains the calamity of the Flood.

After attaining the Dao, they rise into formlessness.

**Lifting the Dao-Qi Lamp of the Southwestern Direction:**
I solemnly ignite the divine lamp of the Southwestern Dipper, dispersing the Imperial True Spirit-Qi of the Primordial Origin—*the Dao-Qi of the Five Central Spirits*—to illuminate the *Butchery Hell*, thereby breaking the calamity of being inverted and slaughtered. I invoke the *Random Direction Saviour* of the *Mustard Heaven*.

I pray that the *Kunyu* (Earthly Vehicle) bears all things, yet does not reveal the dwelling in the middle of the earth’s terrain; that the Dao-Qi of the Primordial Void flows through the *Gang* (Starry Net), stationed at the right of the *Jing* (Well) where the stars are arrayed. The vast and boundless virtue of the Great Spirit soars, and the noble and tranquil realm is ascended.

With ten thousand treasures arrayed and a hundred spirits in attendance, the ritual is complete. Now, the officiant of certain rank liberates the departed soul of certain individual, who ascends to the *Yang* (Yang) realm. The lamp is lit, and the *Mustard Heaven’s* divine scripture is bestowed.

The multitude harmonizes and proclaims the scripture: the Dao-Qi of the Four Central Spirits is serene and colorless, the *Mustard Heaven* opposing the Great *Luo* (Netherworld). The spirit’s transformation divides into four scenes, with ten thousand verdant and crimson threads extending afar. The wandering spirit does not linger but returns, and in one moment, it vanquishes the myriad demons.

The Spirit Lord gathers the wandering Dao-Qi, drifting and refining the white brilliance. In the *Chunshou* (Spring Autumn) era of the *Chun* (Chun) Tree, ascending to the appointed fate, the void generates divine scriptures, and the spirit’s resonance escapes the Nine Haze. With one chant, ten thousand true spirits gather; the *Yan* (Eclipse) and the *Shuang* (Brightness) unite in harmony.

The ninefold transformation of the spirit’s brilliance is complete, and the *Yuzhao* (Jade Unction) radiates in profound splendor. The *Mustard Heaven* opens the Great *You* (Possession), and with one celebration, the blessings are manifold. The Supreme Sage returns the Imperial Chariot, and the infant brother joyfully sings in response.

Unable to endure this auspicious gathering, all bow in reverence. I pray that ten million souls may receive illumination, and a thousand respond to the call. The Nine Palaces’ records of life and death are examined, and the Eight Directions’ gates of sin and virtue are opened.

The most humble and the most insignificant alike ascend to the Dao’s shore; the boundless and the infinite all turn the Wheel of Dharma.

After attaining the Dao, they rise into formlessness.

**Lifting the Dao-Qi Lamp of the Western Direction:**
I solemnly ignite the divine lamp of the Western Dipper, dispersing the Imperial True Spirit-Qi of the Primordial Origin—*the Dao-Qi of the High True and Fusion*—to illuminate the *Fire-Wheel Hell*, thereby breaking the calamity of weapons and fire-wheels. I invoke the *Random Direction Saviour* of the *Mustard Heaven*.

I pray that the Wheel of Dharma completes ten transformations, and the Imperial Threshold stands ninefold. The celestial arch spans the vault, and the spirit’s essence is refined through three changes; the *Kanyuan* (Primordial Strength) is vigorous and just, corresponding to the ruler’s virtue in the six *Yao* (Trigrams). In the honored rank of the Four Nines, it stands at the extreme of the *Chongyang* (Double Yang).

It responds without speech, and with feeling, it communicates. Now, the officiant of certain rank liberates the departed soul of certain individual, who ascends to the celestial realm. The lamp is lit, and the *Divine Transformation’s* scripture is bestowed.

The multitude harmonizes and proclaims the scripture: the Dao-Qi of the Six *Chongyang* (Fusion) is serene and without color, illuminating the *Yingsheng* (Responsive) realm and mapping the ten directions. The transformation’s wheel is without shadow, and the mystic period ascends to the Dao’s field.

The spirit’s chariot does not await the reins, and the void’s brilliance is manifest in divine scriptures. The emptiness is vast without bounds, and the profound clarity is also the limit. Refining the embryo and returning to the original beginning, it eternally upholds the Dao’s beam.

The *Qizhu* (Seven Trees) dissipate the celestial spirit’s true nature, and the scattered thoughts await the *□* (unclear) constant. The *Bao* (Fetter) trees are cut away, and the mind wanders beyond the *□* (unclear) #1 capital.

I pray that the gathering of the profound and the profound may be realized, and that my essence may be forgotten in enlightenment. The blessings of the Nine Heavens are embraced, and the rites of the earthly trigrams are exchanged. The mixing of transformations returns to the Primordial Unity, and the high structure of the *Yuan* (Primordial) *Shi* (Beginning) *Wang* (King) is attained.

Bowing in reverence to the spirit’s boundless operation, I eternally express gratitude for the liberation from the tumult of dust. I pray that the people of the lineage may establish their ranks, that the *Fanxing* (Buddhist conduct) may open its light, and that those who burn incense and scatter flowers may come together to this sacred place, holding talismans and scriptures, all arriving before the Emperor.

Cutting off the evil roots of the Six Realms,
Awakening the virtuous thoughts of the Five Doors.
After attaining the Dao, one ascends to the Formless.
The solemn **Beizi** (北卮) God-lamp burns,
Spreading the **Zhenyuan** (真元) **Qi** of the Celestial Emperor’s command—
the **Yuan Gao** (元高) **Xian** (仙) **Dong** (洞) **Jie** (笈) **Qi** (之炁).
Below, it illuminates the **Mingling** (溟泠) underworld,
Breaking the trials of the **Hanchi** (寒池) and **Chudu** (楚毒).

Congeals the wondrous stillness, solemn and resplendent.

Now, the **Zhai** (斋) **Guan** (官) certain person liberates the form and soul of the departed **Muo** (亡过) certain person,
Sending them to be reborn in the heavenly realm.
Yet the **Beizi** (北卮) God-lamp is lit.

The assembly harmonizes and proclaims the **Zhang** (章).

The **Xuanhui** (玄会) boundless, the **Qi** (炁) merged returning to **Fanxing** (梵行) **Fuxian** (梵辅).
The **Yun** (运) of the **Linghua** (灵化) is swift, its operation subtle without cold or heat.
Riding the **Shu** (数) to construct the **Zhen** (贞) **Tiao** (条),
Lifting the sleeve to brush the light **Yu** (羽).
The **Qiongfang** (琼房) holds wondrous resonance,
Ascending the high divine abode.
The **Yuanlun** (圆轮) reflects without ceasing,
The **Zhenxian** (真仙) arrayed in solemn ranks.
The lofty **Xiaohu** (霄衢) stretches far,
The **Dongyuan** (洞元) profound and vast.
The **Xiuye** (秀叶) shades the **Cuixia** (翠霞),
Its shadow resting on the **Qingling** (清泠) isle.
Roaming and delighting in the Five Divine Spirits,
Multiplying thoughts with joyful companions.
The Five Trials vanish by Dao’s logic,
The heart soars in tranquil serenity.
The **Shuangshen** (爽魂) follows its original root,
Hovering in the void above.
The **Qichong** (七诵) opens the **Zhongguan** (重关),
Clearing stagnation with the **Feixian** (飞仙) **Wu** (武).
The **Yun** (运) flows from the center,
High chanting and bowing in reverence.
I humbly pray that the **Ciyin** (慈因) blessings last through countless **Jie** (劫),
And extend grace to all living beings.

The **Jing** (定) waters are clear and cold,
Subduing all spirits within **Yùjué** (郁绝).
The **Keng** (镢) heavens are vast and open,
Binding the Six **Gui** (鬼) in **Luodang** (罗酆).
The **Dao** (道) and **De** (德) flourish and rise,
Heaven and humanity rejoice in harmony.
After attaining the Dao, one ascends to the Formless.
The solemn **Beizi** (北卮) God-lamp burns in the east-north,
Spreading the **Zhenhua** (真华) **Qi** of the Celestial Emperor’s command—
the **Yuan Zhenlinghua** (元真灵化) **Ning** (凝) **Qi** (之炁),
Below, it illuminates the **Jiangtang** (镬汤) underworld,
Breaking the trials of the **Tiecha** (铁叉) and **Zhuxi** (煮渍).
Invoking the **Youfu Jiuhu Tianzun** (随方救苦天尊),
I humbly offer: the **Xuandou** (旋斗) **Li** (历) **Jī** (箕), the **Yangjiao** (羊角) **Chu** (出) **Fuxiao** (扶摇) **Qi** (之炁);
The **Jiuhe** (九和) **Shihé** (十合),
The **Bixia** (碧霞) dividing the **Luoluo** (罗络) heavens.
Thus residing in the **Changle** (长乐) **Futang** (福堂),
Below lies the **Shuoyin** (朔阴) shadowy underworld.
The Year begins anew,
All things reach their final form.

Now, the **Zhai** (斋) **Guan** (官) certain person liberates the form and soul of the departed **Muo** (亡过) certain person,
Ascending them to the **Yangjie** (阳界) realm.

The assembly harmonizes and proclaims the **Zhang** (章).
The **Qi** (炁) of the Eight **Hua** (化) is congealed—

The **Yuzhang** (玉章) scatters to the heart’s core,
The **Gujing** (孤景) gathers the **Linghui** (灵会).

Coming and going like unfastening a sash.
The **Mingshi** (明识) generates the **Shenbao** (神宝) **Zhang** (章),
High roaming without central defeat.
The **Xuanjing** (玄景) gleams on the **Yunhu** (云衢),
Its trace surpassing the **Shenfang** (神方) beyond.
The response is boundless and without limit,
Temporarily riding the **Sidu** (四大).
Devoting the heart to bow in reverence and chant,
All saints together proclaim joy.

I humbly pray that the **Tianbao** (天宝) **Jinshu** (金书),
The **Hunyuan** (混元) **Zuxian** (祖炁),
The **Kai Guang** (开光) **Longhan** (龙汉),
May illuminate and dispel the **Chongyin** (重阴).
The departed soul may achieve the **Feixian** (飞仙),
The dried bones regenerate in the **Ren Dao** (人道).

After attaining the Dao, one ascends to the Formless.
The solemn **Beizi** (北卮) God-lamp burns at the center,
Spreading the **Zhenyue** (真岳) **Fu** (府) **Qi** (之炁) of the Celestial Emperor’s command—
the **Yuan Ziran** (元自然) **Xuanzhao** (玄照) **Qi** (之炁),
Below, it illuminates the **Puluo** (普掠) underworld,
Breaking the trials of the **Daoshanzhujinshu** (刀山剑树).
Invoking the **Youfu Jiuhu Tianzun** (随方救苦天尊),
I humbly offer: the **Weixian** (至圣) **Zhizhen** (至真),

The Formless and Shadowless,
The Eight Directions paying homage to the **Qixian** (七宝) **Gong** (宫).
Unifying the **Huangshang** (皇上) **Tianyuan** (天元),
Controlling the **Zhongyang** (中央) **Diji** (地纪).
The **Weiguang** (威光) radiates,
The **Shende** (神德) stands tall and firm.

Now, the **Zhai** (斋) **Guan** (官) certain person liberates the form and soul of the departed **Muo** (亡过) certain person,
Ascending them to the **Yangjie** (阳界) realm.
Yet the **Beizi** (北卮) God-lamp is lit.

The **Wujie** (无结) **Qi** (气) is fixed, the **Wuqing** (无情) unfathomable,
The **Lunhua** (沦化) without order, yet numbers come as they must.
Who says the **Wuxian** (无色) realm is flat?
Majestic peaks rise like countless hills.
The **Mingxin** (冥心) wanders freely,
Aspiring to the **Qingxian** (清仙) **Zheng** (征).
This is no ordinary year,
The **Jie** (劫) **Shu** (数) how can it be measured?
The **Fushuang** (浮爽) follows its **Gutiao** (故条),
The **Fanpei** (反胎) has its own constancy.
The **Linggan** (灵感) pierces the **Taixu** (太虚),
Ascending the **Yingyun** (霄上) **Bing** (冰).
The **Jinzi** (津趣) stirs the **Wanliu** (万流),
The **Qianning** (潜凝) **Zhenxian** (真神) **Deng** (登).
The **Wuxian** (无爱) realm is without worry,
High observation and bowing in reverence.
I humbly pray that the **Wuwei** (无为) Great Dao,
The **Shangdi** (上帝) High True One.
Residing at the **Cibei** (慈悲) **Shanqiao** (善巧) gate,
Manifesting the **Weimiaoxuanming** (微妙光明) subtle and radiant form.
One body receives blessings,
Becoming a **Jinquo** (金阙) minister.
Nine clans ascend as **Xian** (仙),
All entering the **Yuxu** (玉虚) assembly.

*(Recitation of scriptures, chanting, and dedication complete.)*
