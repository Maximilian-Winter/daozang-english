**Ritual Procedure as Prescribed:**

**Opening Invocation and Offerings**
With humility, I light the nine-cup divine lamp to invoke the blessings of the Three Pure Ones (Sanqing), the Four Sovereigns (Sida), the Ten-Directional Savior of Suffering (Shifang Jiugu Tianzun), the Venerable Assemblage of the Dao (De Dao Shengzhong), the Nine-Island Territorial Deities (Jiuchou Sheling Shenjun), the Nine Abyssal Netherworld Officials (Jiuyou Dingyu Mingguan), and the True Sovereigns overseeing the Three Realms (Sanjie Zhiren Zhuizhai).

May the benevolent auspices of the Dao be invoked, and my prayers verified. I, [name], a lay officiant of the fast, follow the clear instructions and now light the nine-cup divine lamp.

**Upper Illumination:**
It shines upon the Three Realms (Sanjing) and all celestial halls (zhutian fangtang), dispelling darkness and revealing brilliance, its radiance pervading the Ten Directions (Shifang).

**Middle Illumination:**
It illuminates the Central Realm (Zhonggong) of the Divine State (Shenzhou), causing malevolent forces to retreat and calamities to vanish.

**Lower Illumination:**
It descends into the Nine-Layered (Jiulei) Netherworld, where the heavy darkness of the Great Earthly Underworlds (Dadiyu) prevails. Wherever the light reaches, suffering and guilt dissolve; where the power extends, the living and the dead alike attain blessings.

I dare to rely on the gathered assembly to jointly extol and praise.
