**Shangqing Heavenly Treasure Retreat First Night Rite**

*Sutra Title:* *Shangqing Heavenly Treasure Retreat First Night Rite*. One scroll. Source text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Weiyi* Category.

The *Shangqing Heavenly Treasure Retreat* is the essential method for Dao seekers aspiring to immortality. Only after receiving the full transmission of *Shangqing* esoteric teachings may one perform this retreat. Those who have received only intermediate methods are not permitted to undertake the *Heavenly Treasure Retreat*.

First, prayers are offered for the blessings of emperors and rulers; next, petitions are made for the grace of ancestral spirits. Through this, past transgressions are purified, new faults repented, merits perfected, and virtue fully realized—naturally attaining immortality and ascending in broad daylight.

**Offerings for the Son of Heaven (Emperor):**
- Five golden dragons, each weighing five *liang*
- Five jade discs, each three *cun* square
- Nine bolts of azure silk (east)
- Three bolts of crimson silk (south)
- Seven bolts of white silk (west)
- Five bolts of black silk (north)
- Twelve bolts of yellow silk (center)

All above ceremonial silks must be tightly woven and of substantial thickness. Thin or flimsy fabrics are not to be used.

**Offerings for Dukes and Marquises:**
- Five golden dragons, each weighing one *liang*
- Five jade discs, of varying sizes
- One bolt each of azure silk (east), crimson silk (south), white silk (west), black silk (north), and yellow silk (center)

All ceremonial silks must be tightly woven and of substantial thickness. Thin or flimsy fabrics are not to be used.

**Offerings for Commoners:**
- Nine *chi* of azure silk (east)
- Three *chi* of crimson silk (south)
- Seven *chi* of white silk (west)
- Five *chi* of black silk (north)
- Twelve *chi* of yellow silk (center)

All ceremonial silks must be tightly woven and of substantial thickness. Thin or flimsy fabrics are not to be used.

The *Azure Lad* states: If one’s cultivation is long-standing, dwelling in mountains and caves with profound devotion to the Dao and earnest desire for immortality, then incense and lamps alone suffice—no need for dragons or silks. With purity of heart and sincerity, the Dao is naturally attained.

For those preparing the retreat:
First, inscribe nine *True Writs* in yellow on azure paper and place them upon a small table at the *Heavenly Gate*. On the day of repayment to the celestial officials, burn them at the *Heavenly Gate*.

From the Son of Heaven to commoners, thirty-two *Heavenly Lamps* are lit upon the altar’s tiers, one lamp per station. The middle and lower tiers may be adjusted according to one’s capacity.

Beyond the altar, light the *Twenty-Eight Constellation Lamps*, the *Five Planetary Lamps*, the *Five Lamps of One’s Destiny*, and the *Nine Lamps of One’s Current Year* at their respective positions. Candles should be provided in sufficient quantity.

The altar’s gates and placards follow the same method as the *Yellow Register Retreat*.

First, the retreat’s sponsor is led before the *Mystic Master* to declare the retreat’s purpose.
Next, the *Invocation of the Dao* is chanted.
Then, the *Three Masters* are purified.

Next, the *Praise of Hua-Xia* is recited, and the sponsor is led to the *Earthly Gate*.

Next, the *Water Edict* is pronounced.
Next, the *Ascent to the Altar* incantation is chanted as one enters through the *Heavenly Gate*:

*"The qi of Heaven’s Mystery is pure,
The Three Luminaries illumine with clarity.
Within the golden chamber and Daoist sanctum,
Five sacred mushrooms flourish as treasures.
Violet clouds and purple canopies
Come to adorn my form.
Jade lads and jade maidens
Convey my spirit’s efficacy.
The Five Thearchs align in radiance,
The Three Luminaries share their chariot.
Mounting dragons and cranes,
I ascend into the Purple Court.
The retreat’s sponsor seeks blessings,
Wishing to preserve long life.
Messengers of communion with the Perfected,
Hasten to report to the Supreme Clarity."*

Next, the procession circles the altar. During the day, begin from the East; at night, from the North.
Next, incense is offered at the *Imperial Table*.
Next, incense is offered at one’s station.
Next, each participant bows to the masters, contemplating as prescribed.

Next, the *Guardian Spirit Incantation* is recited.
Next, the *Dharma Drum* is struck twenty-four times.
Next, the *Incense Burner is Opened*:

*"To the Five Numinous Elders of the Upper Primordial,
The Vacuous and Spontaneous Original Heavenly Venerable of the One,
The Supreme Heavenly Treasure Lord,
The Bearers of Golden Chapters and Fragrant Commands,
The Jade Maidens of Pure Spirit,
The Eighty-One Attendants of the Left and Right Jade Numinous Spontaneity,
The Flying Radiance Dragon-Riders—
All emerge in solemn majesty.
We invoke the local earthbound Perfected Officials of this realm.
We now burn incense and perform the Dao,
Dedicating this to the retreat’s sponsor, [Rank] [Name],
Who establishes the Great Retreat of the Heavenly Treasure of Supreme Clarity,
A one-night Daoist arena,
Three days of ritual proceedings,
With refined orchid offerings,
Purified and adorned with fragrant flowers,
Silken banners and golden dragons,
To beseech blessings and invoke grace.
May the Golden Elixir and Jade Radiance of the Supreme Ten Directions
Descend and flow into the sponsor’s being,
And may our petition swiftly reach the presence of the August Jade Emperor and the Myriad Saints."*

Next, each participant states their name and rank:

*"The humble servant [Name], holding the ritual office of [Rank],
Conducts the Great Retreat of the Heavenly Treasure of Supreme Clarity,
The first-night ritual proceedings,
Along with all Daoist participants and the retreat’s sponsor,

The Golden Watchtower of the Jade Capital in the Mysterious Metropolis,
The Seven Treasures of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace,
The Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure of the Perfected and Radiant August Dao,

And all Perfected Numinosities.

We have heard:
The round and clear, the square and turbid,
Conceive the Origin within the Mysterious Pass;
Receiving form and dividing appearance,
They draw upon the numinous power of the Wondrous Dao."*

The ceaseless cycle revolves, nurturing all without omission;
It covers and bears, gives life and completes, governing brightness and transgressions, blessings and misfortunes.
This is the teaching expounded by the Primordial Thearch, the statutes flowing from the Most High.
It scatters the Dharma rain to cleanse worldly toils;
It navigates the vessel of compassion to transcend the sea of suffering.

Thus, the patron of this retreat, so-and-so, dares to present earnest supplications,
To knock upon the Mysterious Pass from above,
Beseeching blessings and imploring grace,
Dispelling calamities and dispersing misfortunes.
Arrayed are incense and lamps, silken banners, and golden dragons,
As a single night’s Daoist sanctuary is established,
To attend the Dharma assemblies of the three watches.

Your servant, born of humble flesh and nourished by common milk,
Has, by accumulated karmic affinities, been fortunate to dwell within the transformative influence of the Mysterious,
And from youth, donning cap and hempen robe, has aspired to the true lineage.
Receiving the Dharma register at the Star Altar,
Transmitting the fragrant lamp in the Moon Palace,
On the day of ascending the altar, at the hour of making vows,
Pledged to expound the profound Dao and proclaim the sacred scriptures.
For all who turn toward this Way, how dare I not make it known above?

The patron’s blue petition shall now be reverently proclaimed.
Proceed to read the petition.

In accordance with the petition’s intent,
The sincerity of the prayer for blessings runs deep,
To deliver and ferry the living and the dead,
To extend blessings and longevity.
With mind set and intention raised,
The Three Realms take distant note.
Acknowledging past transgressions and pursuing faults,
May the myriad sages grant indulgence.
Holding incense and fire in hand,
The heart prays to the Void and Nonexistent.
Performing the Dao for three watches,
Establishing a single retreat,
Refining the orchid’s fragrance,
Adorning with pure incense and flowers.
Inviting the lofty Perfected of the Three Isles,
Descending the exalted sages of the Ten Directions.
The vast and distant Mysterious Heavens,
All supplications reach and are heard;
The boundless Great Dao,
Its profound meaning is invoked.
May it discern the earnest plea for redress of wrongs,
And heed the words of repentance for past faults.
Deign to bestow profound grace,
And broadly open the statutes of pardon.
Considering the foolishness and shortcomings of the past,
Forsaking the deep transgressions of former times,
The errors of past lives,
The faults of this present existence.
May it allow the hundred bones to be joyfully unobstructed,
The six palaces harmoniously regulated,
The five viscera gladdened,
The myriad spirits at peace.
The Crimson Palace inscribed with the characters of ascension,
The Dark Bureau purged of names of decay.
All myriad entanglements dissolved,
A thousand auspicious signs arrive in succession.
Enmities cease their opposition,
Creditors halt their claims,
Accidental killings and unintended harms,
All are resolved and released.

Let the mind be free of distracting thoughts,
And the contemplation fixed upon the Mysterious Pass.
Tonight, briefly disclose the reasons for this retreat;
Tomorrow, separately present the prayers and supplications.
The local earth deities and territorial Perfected Officials,
Record the merits of this retreat,
And report them above to the Perfected Realm.
All earnest wishes,
Ascend before the Jade Thearch’s throne in the Three Pure Ones’ boundless court.

Proceed to pay homage to the Ten Directions.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and submit,
To the Highest Heavenly Treasure Primordial Sovereign of the Infinite and Boundless North,
The Most High Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Clarity.
For each direction, perform one bow in like manner.

Proceed with sincere repentance.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and submit,
To the Heavenly Treasure Primordial Sovereigns of the Boundless Great Dao in the Ten Directions,
The Jade Thearchs of Supreme Clarity.
Today, we repent and dissolve our faults and transgressions,
May vast compassion descend,
And profound blessings be bestowed.

We pay homage to all in the east, west, south, north,
Above and below, the four intermediate directions,
The sun, moon, and stars,
The famous mountains and grotto-heavens,
The Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways,
The Eight Seas and Nine Rivers,
The officials and attendants of the Three Realms,
And all Perfected Numinosities.

We pray for the present emperor,
May his sagely reign be long and distant,
And the imperial domain secure and unshaken.

We repent for ourselves, the officials, civil and military,
And for the patron of this retreat,
The nine generations of ancestors and distant kin,
Inner and outer relatives,
The four companions and three masters,
Superiors and subordinates,
All family members.
For transgressions and faults in past lives and this present existence,
Through countless kalpas,
Disrespecting the sacred and scorning the worthy,
Deceiving and misleading the four assemblies,
Being disloyal and unfilial,
Destroying images and scriptures,
Harming the innocent,
And injuring living beings.
Such offenses and trespasses,
Piled high as mountains,
Without the power of the Dao to dissolve and dispel,
There would be no means to attain the fruits of immortality.
May all past faults be extinguished,
And new blessings fully realized.
May auspiciousness and felicity prevail,
And the Perfected Numinosities grant their protection.
Enmities cease their opposition,
Creditors halt their claims,
Accidental killings and unintended harms,
All are resolved and released.
The Crimson Palace inscribed with records,
The Dark Bureau purged of names,
Eternally dwelling in the blessed land,
Forever flourishing in the realm of longevity.
Misfortunes sink into the nine nights,
Blessings arise from the ten directions.
We bow our heads in reverence and take refuge,
In the true Three Treasures.

Proceed to recite the *Primordial Three Heavens Chapters*.

**Hymn to the Clear and Subtle Heaven**
The Primordial pervades the empty void,
The three qi refine the upper gate.
Purple radiance bathes the great expanse,
The four luminaries plant the numinous root.
Wondrous transformations issue from the eastern jade,
The three conveniences open the western Kunlun.
Vastly reflecting the ninefold clarity,
The five blossoms gird the brocade clouds.
The net of separation shines with divine lamps,
The seven stars fear the northern origin.
Soaring to the precincts of Supreme Clarity,
Wing to wing, the Thearch’s singular honor.
Lofty and exalted, the Highest unfurls,
How the feathered youths swarm!
Flowing fragrance, originally without color,
Pervades the myriad immortals.
To the left, revolving through the three kalpas,
To the right, turning the nine celestial gates.
Golden blossoms and white clouds,
The eight winds dance in the empty wheel.
The four seasons never cease their mechanism,
Blue and white are early distinct.
Nine nines transform the kalpa’s fate,
Three threes pass through a single kalpa.
Heaven and Earth have their final meeting,
Obstruction and stimulus return to their proper turn.
The Dharma of Orthodox Unity is clearly understood,
The six celestial texts are strictly cultivated.
Great Peace returns to the empty void,
To serve and assist the later sagely sovereign.

**Hymn to the Yu-Yu Heaven**
A numinous wind rises at the western gate,
Brocade clouds arise from the eastern jade.
The three qi illumine the jade isles,
Flowing fragrance rides the light smoke.
Five blossoms scatter in the wind,
Suddenly and fleetingly brightening the ninefold clarity.
The soaring trees fear the vermilion sun,
Yellow blossoms follow the moon’s birth.
Within, the lads who gather magic mushrooms,
Clothed in feathers, girded with flying azure.
Their soaring forms traverse the myriad peaks,
Carefree, feasting in green chariots.
Controlling the ninefold empty wheels,
Their movement unfolds without fixed measure.
To the left, they command the three celestial texts,
To the right, they marshal the six celestial soldiers.
Examining qi, they return to the empty cavern,
The six perfections respond to the turning of fate.
The kalpa’s fate has its own meeting,
Who can fathom defeat and success?
Vast waves engulf the net of clouds,
The six directions leave no form behind.
Corpse-souls drift in the long current,
Lonely spirits sink and scatter.
Grieving this going and coming,
Only then is the true Dharma perceived.
Those who pursue learning with utmost refinement,
Bind their jade names in the Eastern Flower.
Rejoicing in those inscribed on the white tablets,
Together they delight in Great Peace.

**Hymn to the Great Red Heaven**
The celestial scriptures revolve through the celestial passes,
The five qi turn the three subtleties.
The purple portals emit jade tablets,
The golden gates receive the divine radiance.

The Eight Assemblies converge with the true wind,
Radiant and bright, the layered darkness unfolds.
Beyond the Nine Pures at heaven’s edge,
The lofty dawn revolves in solitude.
Three hues return to empty nothingness,
The four seasons respond to the jade mechanism.
The River Lord has already raised his brush,
The five phases subtly propel one another.
The six perfections know no end or kalpa,
When fate is exhausted, they ride qi to return.
Ten thousand demons spread across the heavens,
Hordes of malevolence vie to display their might.
The multitudes bear the brunt of calamity,
Piles of corpses move one to sorrow.
Wondrous is the scripture of the true Dharma,
Treading kalpas, its brilliance never fades.
At the appointed time, they will be received,
Their covenant lies at the Nine Heavens’ gate.
With you, I pledge Great Peace,
Releasing the body to fly wingless.

**Threefold Prostration**
With devoted heart, we bow in reverence,
To the Boundless, the Ineffable, the Primordial Highest Heavenly Treasure Yuanjun, Supreme Clarity Heavenly Worthy.
With devoted heart, we bow in reverence,
To the Thirty-Six Sections of the Supreme Clarity True Scripture, the Natural Yellow Writ of the Utmost Numinous Text.
With devoted heart, we bow in reverence,
To the Three Supreme Worthies of the Mysterium, the Dharma Masters, the Sagely Hosts of Virtue, and all the Immortals and Perfected.

**Reiterating Names and Titles**
The Void, the Spontaneous, the Boundless Dao, the Highest Primordial Heavenly Treasure Yuanjun, the Jade Emperor, the Most High Lord Lao, the Supreme Ministers, the Officials of the Three Realms, and all the true numina.
Your servant, though unworthy, has encountered the transformation of the Dao, possessing from past lives a numinous origin. Having received the true talismans and obtained the jade decrees, on the day of ordination and the hour of vows, I pledged to expound the mysterious principles and proclaim the sagely canon.
The officiants, fervent in their prayers for grace and profound in their repentance for transgressions, have observed the three days of the ritual, established this single fast, sent incense flying to the Eight Sceneries, and kindled lamps blooming with a thousand flowers. They pray before the precious throne, concentrating their thoughts upon the azure heavens above.
We humbly beseech the Void’s sagely hosts and the Most High Perfected to witness this sincerity and bestow abundant auspicious blessings. May your servant attain the Dao, remain unassailed by demonic trials, be protected by the myriad sages, and be assisted by the thousand spirits.
Today, in accordance with the ritual statutes, we recite the precepts and circumambulate the altar. Tomorrow, we shall burn incense and present further petitions. May your compassionate illumination descend, gazing upon our devotion, delivering the deluded, and swiftly elevating them to the cloud paths. May the living and the dead alike find peace, preserving purity together, with lifespans towering like Mount Tai and blessings deep as the Eastern Sea.
Above, we extol the Heavenly Worthy’s nurturing grace; below, we fulfill our vow of submission. Grateful for the true and numinous, we implore your radiant regard. With reverence, we bow again.

**Eight Vows**
To the Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor, the Primordial Lady of the Grand Simplicity, the Most High Numinous Immortal Capital’s Great Deity, we now present our eight vows:
First, to soar through the heavens and attain long life as divine immortals;
Second, for heaven and earth to unite in harmonious winds and clouds;
Third, for the Five Peaks to endure with our bodies forever;
Fourth, for the nine generations of ancestors to have their sins absolved and transgressions dissolved;
Fifth, for fortune and longevity to sever the roots of rebirth;
Sixth, for refinement of form and the full flowering of wisdom;
Seventh, to vanquish demons and decapitate the lords of the Six Heavens;
Eighth, for the sweet dew to extend through eternal kalpas.

**Reactivating the Censer**
Immortal spirits, immortal officials, golden lads and messengers, the Five Emperors and Five Peaks, divine immortals and perfected beings, the true numina of the Three Luminaries, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Celestial Immortals, the Five Numinous Incense Officials—now summon and bring forth the primordial qi of the ten directions’ supreme true beings, the spontaneous golden liquid, the cinnabar essence, the mushroom stalks, the jade perfected of the Nine Heavens, to this fast’s altar. May they gaze upon the fast’s sponsor, shelter and uplift them to ascend as immortals, soaring through the great void, ascending the Nine Heavens in radiant splendor. Jade lads and jade maidens, attend and guard the incense smoke.
Convey your servant’s earlier petitions swiftly to the Most High Perfected, the Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor, and the myriad sages before them.

**Hymn of Circumambulation**
Once around the altar, descending from the platform:
The host of immortals emerges from the grotto’s truth,
Resplendent, they illuminate the Great Clarity.
Those who serve are called immortals,
Their forms and essences enduring forever.
Carefree, they sport in the mysterious void,
Their palaces arrayed beyond form.
Their brilliance adorns the Seven Treasures’ grove,
Radiant as the sun and moon’s essence.
Dragon scales intertwine in swift flight,
Phoenixes soar with mournful cries.
The Most High governs the Mysterious Palace,
The host of perfected recites the grotto scriptures.
Burning incense, we bow in reverence,
Circling left, we depart the palace walls.
Three rounds return to the high seat,
The Heavenly Worthy responds to the sound.
With single-minded devotion to the supreme Dao,
May the world universally know peace.

**Incantation for Descending the Altar**
Those who cultivate immortality now descend the altar, exiting through the Earth Gate:
Fortune and longevity having passed,
Names are stricken from the registers of the dead.
By the Celestial Emperor’s decree,
They shall live for a hundred million kalpas as one.
The rites concluded, all return to their stations,
The myriad spirits find repose.
The gates are opened, the true numina descend once more.
Before the Mysterium’s master, they bow in gratitude and disperse.

The rites of the Supreme Clarity Heavenly Treasure Fast’s first watch are now complete.
