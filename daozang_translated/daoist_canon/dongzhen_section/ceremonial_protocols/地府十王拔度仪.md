**The Rite of the Ten Kings of Earth Prison for Deliverance**
**Dharma Service**

To all boundless sages we make universal offering,
Incense smoke ascends to the Great Web of Heaven.
To all immeasurable sages of the heavens,
To sun, moon, Dipper, and stars,
To the ancestral masters of scriptures and registers,
To the high perfected of the Celestial Courts—
May you bestow the power of great compassion,
To deliver this departed spirit.
*And inconceivable merit and virtue.*

To all boundless sages we make universal offering,
Incense smoke pierces the gates of darkness.
To the Fengdu and Mount Tai bureaus,
To the offices that examine and judge sinful souls,
To the dark prisons filling every hell,
To the mighty spirits of Earth Prison—
May you bestow the power of great compassion,
To deliver this departed spirit.
*And inconceivable merit and virtue.*

To all boundless sages we make universal offering,
Incense smoke pervades Fusang.
To the rivers, Yangtze, Huai, and seas,
To thunder, lightning, rain, and dragon deities,
To the valleys of the Ten Continents and Three Isles,
To the immortals of the Water Palaces—
May you bestow the power of great compassion,
To deliver this departed spirit.
*And inconceivable merit and virtue.*

**Invocation of the Sages**
**Proceeding to the Ritual Procedures**

Prostrate, we observe: Heaven towers above, Earth lies below, arraying all beings in manifest clarity; sun departs, moon arrives, completing the cyclic succession of the four seasons. What is born must perish, what has no beginning knows no end. Beholding how mountains and marshes cannot conceal, we know the form’s fate cannot be escaped. August Heaven watches, Creation is impartial. Though in life there be distinctions of noble and base, in death there is no disparity of high or low.

A human lifetime is but an illusion, unsubstantial; the bodily frame is a temporary convergence, forcibly assembled into four limbs. It resembles a spring dream upon the pillow, a spark within the stone; like a fierce wind extinguishing the candle, a bubble floating upon the water. Transformation and dissolution occur in the space of a moment, formation and decay in the blink of an instant. The form returns to Earth, the po-soul retreats to the hidden realms.

Only the Perfected One transcends the wondrous beyond, walking above the myriad multitudes, seated amidst the throngs of ancients. Though a thousand years pass, upon return he sighs that the city walls remain the same; in a single instant of sudden awakening, even the cosmos cannot contain him. Yet without self-realization, the same fate is inescapable—all alike return to dust.

Now, the officiant [Name] prostrates on behalf of the deceased [Name], fearing that during their time in the world, their body bore boundless transgressions. They take refuge in the true teaching, grandly opening the jade scriptures. Reverently facing the Perfected Ones, they extol the sacred names:

**Great Sage Three Treasures Heavenly Worthy**

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning was in the Jade Capital of the Western Na Country, upon the secluded Mount Yu-jue, within the Golden Hall of the Palace of Eternal Joy. Together with the Most High Dao Lord, he expounded the *Scripture of the Worlds of the Living and the Dead*, detailing the ten great hells, the karmic conditions of sin and merit, the ceaseless retributions. The Wondrous Practice Perfected One, receiving this radiant illumination, descended into the Nine Dark Realms to universally deliver the departed spirits, enabling all to attain transcendence.

Through this repentance, we proclaim this virtuous affinity. Each awakens sincere devotion, joining voices in praise and recitation:

**We sincerely venerate the Most High Great Luo Heaven, the Three Clarities, the Three Realms, the Three Treasures Heavenly Worthy.**

The sacred names of the Three Worthies possess boundless merit and virtue, capable of delivering the departed, capable of protecting those presently living. For the deceased [Name], we now perform posthumous rites for the path of darkness, that they may swiftly achieve transcendence.

First, we invite the Fivefold Dark Fragrance to offer to the Three Clarities and Supreme Saints, that they descend into the ritual arena. Next, we invite the Great Virtue Dharma Master to conduct the ritual proceedings, relying upon the assembly of the Dharma to join in unison, extolling the inconceivable:

**Dao incense, virtue incense, non-action incense, liberation incense, the naturally subtle incense of rebirth.**

The incense wafts gently, tinkling like jade pendants; only the Dharma Master’s voice of praise is heard. As the treasure repository opens, Heaven and Earth grow still—soon, wondrous light arises. One stick of dark incense is kindled to summon the soul’s return, offered aloft to the Jade Morning Worthy. May you bestow the power of great compassion without hindrance, enabling the departed to swiftly attain transcendence.
*And inconceivable merit and virtue.*

Burning incense, we reverently invoke the King within the Dharma, the Sage Lord of the Qingwei Heaven:
**Who generates Heaven, Earth, and all beings—**
**The Most High Jade Clarity, Primordial Beginning Worthy.**
*And inconceivable merit and virtue.*

Burning incense, we reverently invoke the King within the Dharma, the Teaching Lord of the Yuyu Heaven:
**Who transmits scriptures, teachings, and the myriad Dharmas—**
**The Most High Jade Morning, Great Dao Lord.**
*And inconceivable merit and virtue.*

Burning incense, we reverently invoke the King within the Dharma, the Transformation Lord of the Taichi Heaven:
**Who fashions the Three Powers and moves the Five Phases—**
**The Most High Five Spirits, Mysterious Elder Lord.**
*And inconceivable merit and virtue.*

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning addressed the Wondrous Practice Perfected One, saying: Beyond the Northern Dark Sea, a hundred thousand *li* distant, there is a world called Dongyin. Within the country of Shuodan Yujue, there is an Imperial Lord named Five Spirits Mysterious Elder Black Emperor Heavenly Lord, who governs the boundless host of sages of the Northern Realm.

There is a great mountain called Fengdu, which reaches upward to the Terrace of Langfeng, spanning over fifty thousand *li* in circumference. Below, there are six caverns known as the Dark Scenery Heavenly Palaces, which are the domains of the Great Dark Water Emperor, the Northern Dark Heavenly Lord, and the Fengdu Great Emperor. The Direct Envoys of the Heavens, the Spirit Lords of the Five Dippers—Eastern Dipper Lord of Life Qi, Southern Dipper Controller of Prohibitions, Western Dipper Lord of Life Forms, Northern Dipper Controller of Destiny, Central Dipper General Recorder—along with the Earth Masters of the Nine Harmonies and the Great Gods of the Five Peaks serve as their subordinates, assisting in the governance of the Ten Perfected Lords.

The various great hells examine and weigh good and evil, interrogating and tormenting the souls. All the deceased must pass through them.

At that moment, among the assembly was a Perfected One named Wondrous Practice, who gazed upon the Heavenly Worthy and composed these verses to deliver the departed. Today, we proclaim and expound them to perform this repentance and invocation:

**Great Unity Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy**

Burning incense to offer to the Lord of the First Palace of the Dark Realms, the True Lord of Supreme Simplicity and Vast Brilliance—whom the world calls the Great King of Qin Guang. Within its hells, long serpents spew flames, iron dogs exhale smoke. On the seventh day after death, the departed first arrive at this palace.

The Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion, delivers the departed souls, guiding them to depart the dark paths. Thus, we recite the gatha in praise:

**Jade Treasure August Heavenly Worthy**

Vast and desolate, the sea of suffering is truly lamentable;
Evil karma clings to the body, sown by one’s own hands.
Soul and po-soul have returned to the Bureau of Destiny,
The dark gates are locked—when will they open?
Long serpents spew flames, blazing like fire,
Iron dogs exhale smoke, advancing in waves.
Bowing in reverence, we listen to the Three Treasures’ hymns,
Universally enabling deliverance from the Yellow Springs.
*And inconceivable merit and virtue.*

Upon hearing this gatha, the Perfected One rejoiced and leapt for joy, gazing up to thank the Heavenly Worthy, and again recited a gatha in praise:

**Nine Dark Realms Deliverance from Sin Heavenly Worthy**

The boundless sacred power is inconceivable,
Completely releasing the dark prisons’ interrogations.
A single path of auspicious light comes to receive and guide,
The departed spirit follows, ascending to the cinnabar steps.
*May we dedicate this merit to the departed, that they be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.*

Burning incense to offer to the Lord of the Second Palace of the Dark Realms, the True Lord of Dark Virtue and Settled Rest—whom the world calls the Great King of Chu Jiang. Within its hells are knife mountains and sword trees, fiery screens and freezing ice. On the fourteenth day after death, the departed must proceed to this palace.

The Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion, delivers and guides the departed souls to depart from the dark paths, and so recites a gatha in praise:

**Mystic Truth and Myriad Blessings Heavenly Worthy**

All beings create the causes of evil,
Who among them turns their heart to behold the field of blessings?
Sword trees and knife mountains flay the body whole,
Boiling broth follows searing flames, freely stewing and searing.
Countless delusions deceive the heart,
A single thought’s reflection yields only transgressions.
You who take refuge in the supreme Dao,
Shall swiftly attain rebirth in the heavens to come.

*May the inconceivable merit be dedicated.*

Thereupon, the Perfected One, having heard this gatha, rejoiced greatly, bowed his head to the Heavenly Worthy, and again recited a gatha in praise:

**Ten Directions Salvation from Suffering Heavenly Worthy**

The long, long night is pitiable and sorrowful,
All beings endure unbearable suffering.
Relying on the compassionate Honored One’s deliverance,
In an instant, scorching afflictions transform into cool clarity.

*May we dedicate this merit to the departed, that they be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.*

Burning incense to offer to the Lord of the Third Palace of the Dark Realms, the True Lord of Pervasive Clarity and Universal Stillness—whom the world calls the Great King of Song Di. Within its hells, souls swallow fire and consume poison, their bodies flayed and dismembered. On the twenty-first day after death, the departed must proceed to this palace.

The Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, lest they endure such trials, recites a gatha:

**Supremely Wondrous and Utmost Heavenly Worthy**

In the ninefold depths of the dark prisons’ roots,
Through the long night, only the sounds of bitter suffering are heard.
The jailers force you to swallow burning coals,
While ox-headed demons flay and dismember your form.
The fruits of past deeds accumulate heavily,
After death, each sorrow and pain is endured in turn.
Today, hearing the proclamation of the supreme Dao,
This body swiftly departs the vast, cold courts.

*May the inconceivable merit be dedicated.*

Thereupon, the Perfected One, having heard this gatha, filled with great compassion, extolled the Heavenly Worthy and recited a gatha:

**Cinnabar Mound Life-Delivering Heavenly Worthy**

The Heavenly Worthy’s teachings are of great compassion,
All beings of evil karma are fully liberated.
Five-colored auspicious light opens the path,
From this day forth, all assemble in the realm of non-action.

*May we dedicate this merit to the departed, that they be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.*

Burning incense to offer to the Lord of the Fourth Palace, the True Lord of Mystic Virtue and Fivefold Numinosity—whom the world calls the Great King of Wu Guan. Within its hells, souls bear sand and transport stones without rest. On the twenty-eighth day after death, the departed must proceed to this palace.

The Heavenly Worthy, in boundless compassion, moved to pity, delivers all beings and recites a gatha:

**Mystic Supreme Jade Dawn Heavenly Worthy**

In the six caves of Fengdu’s vast dark land,
The lost and wandering souls are truly pitiable.
Souls sunk in evil karma descend to the earthly prisons,
While those who perfect virtuous deeds ascend to heaven.
Bearing sand and transporting stones without rest,
The surging long river seems like boiling broth.
Attend to the compassionate words of the supreme teaching,
Now they enter the hungry belly like sweet dew.

*May the inconceivable merit be dedicated.*

Thereupon, the Perfected One, having heard this gatha, bowed his head to the Heavenly Worthy, extolling without end, and again recited a gatha:

**Dharma Bridge Great Deliverance Heavenly Worthy**

The Heavenly Worthy, in boundless salvation of beings,
With white writs and cinnabar records, welcomes them from the hells.
All transgressions and faults are completely absolved,
From this day forth, their trials and torments instantly transcend.

*May the inconceivable merit be dedicated.*

Burning incense to offer to the Lord of the Fifth Palace of the Dark Realms, the Most Sacred and Radiant Numinous True Lord—whom the world calls the Great King Yanluo. He is the chief minister of the Northern Darkness Heavenly Lord, the overseer of all great hells, his authority equal to the Nine Dark Realms, his rank aligned with the Five Celestial Ladles. On the thirty-fifth day after death, the departed must proceed to this palace. Here, the Mirror of Karma reveals their form, and retribution follows their deeds.

The Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion, universally delivers all beings, and recites a gatha for the deliverance of the departed souls:

**Transcendent Immortal and Supreme Sage Heavenly Worthy**

Beings, deluded, obscure their original cause,
In the vast sea of desire, their hearts err and stray.
Gold and jade, though piled like mountains, cannot aid in death,
At the final hour, only karma follows the body.
The three paths stretch endlessly, without deliverance,
Through the long night of darkness, souls are interrogated.
Yet in an instant, all hells are liberated,
With a single heart, revere the Great Compassionate Honored One.

*May the inconceivable merit be dedicated.*

Thereupon, the Perfected One, having heard this compassion, bowed his head in reverence, addressed the Heavenly Worthy, and again recited a gatha:

**Fire-Refined Cinnabar Realm Heavenly Worthy**

The obstructions of beings’ karma arise from the heart,
Liberation depends on boundless causes.
Bowing to the Supreme Dao of the Void Sovereign,
A single precious gatha surpasses a thousand pieces of gold.

*May we dedicate this merit to the departed, that they be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.*

Burning incense to offer to the Lord of the Sixth Palace, the True Lord of Precious Solemnity and Illustrious Accomplishment—whom the world calls the Great King of Bian Cheng. Within its hells, tongues are pierced with golden nails, and chests are split open with iron axes. On the forty-second day after death, the departed must proceed to this palace. Day and night, their souls are interrogated, enduring all manner of suffering.

The Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion, recites a gatha for all the destitute souls:

**Life-Cherishing Life-Delivering Heavenly Worthy**

Knife mountains and sword trees form forests of iron,
Beings of evil karma now wail in suffering.
The fleeting pleasures of the floating world are like lightning,
Yet in the dark paths, they sink for a thousand kalpas.
The retributions of the nether courts allow no concealment,
Tongues torn out and chests split open—pain beyond endurance.
For you, I extinguish boundless karma,
In the future, bow in gratitude to the Three Clarities.

*May the inconceivable merit be dedicated.*

Thereupon, the Perfected One, having heard this gatha, bowed in reverence, addressed the Heavenly Worthy, and again recited a gatha:

**Golden Portal Transformation-Body Heavenly Worthy**

The Compassionate Honored One, in benevolent deliverance, expounds the causes,
Guiding beings to board the Dharma boat.
Refining and transforming this form into a wondrous essence,
Know now the sacred power is boundlessly great.

*May we dedicate this merit to the departed, that they be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.*

Burning incense to offer to the Lord of the Seventh Palace, the True Lord of Mount Tai’s Mystic Wonders—whom the world calls the Great King of Mount Tai. By the Emperor’s decree, he assists in governing the Northern Darkness, residing on the Eastern Peak by day and entering the nether courts by night. On the forty-ninth day after death, the departed must proceed to this palace. Here, the causes of their deeds are examined, and the weight of their sins and virtues is measured.

The Heavenly Worthy, in deliverance, universally enables their transcendence, and recites a gatha for all beings:

**Supreme Numinous Void Sovereign Heavenly Worthy**

In the human realm, fortune and misfortune have no fixed gate,
You yourselves have planted the roots of good and evil.

Within the heart, one knows only to harbor filth and defilement,
A hundred years pass, and one becomes a lonely shade.
Where the karmic wind blows, life turns to death,
Ten thousand kalpas of sorrow and bitterness—unbearable to hear.

For you, I extinguish boundless karmic deeds,
That you may come to revere the Great Primordial Lord.
And [perform] inconceivable merits.

Thereupon, the Perfected One, hearing this wondrous sound,
Aroused the unsurpassed Dao-mind,
Bowed to the Heavenly Worthy,
And chanted another gatha:

**Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Bliss**

Endless are the prisoners of the Five Sufferings,
Yet the Most High Compassionate Lord lifts them all.
In an instant, they are bathed in sweet dew,
Countless souls emerge from the mire of the dark gates.

And [we] pray to deliver this departed spirit to the Land of Ultimate Bliss.
Burning incense to offer to the Lord of the Eighth Palace, the Supreme Right Deliverance Perfected Lord—
Whom the world calls the Great King of Equality.
Here, sinners embrace bronze pillars and lie upon iron beds.
Only after a hundred days of death do they arrive at this palace.
Those with grave karmic offenses are detained in this hell.

The Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion,
Pities all beings and delivers the sinful souls,
And recites a gatha:

**Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Great Flower**

The underworld officials wield their brushes in wrathful might,
Their interrogations and torments—unbearable to hear.
A hundred years in the world without a shred of goodness,
The departed spirit’s transgressions are like grains of sand.

The yin barrier does not block the yang realm’s light,
Yet for whom do kin intercede to save them?
Only by escaping the dark shackles
May one be born to revere the Great Compassionate Lord.

And [perform] inconceivable merits.

Thereupon, the Perfected One, having heard this gatha,
Bowed in gratitude to the Heavenly Worthy
And chanted another gatha:

**Heavenly Worthy of Wish-Fulfilled Rebirth**

The Sovereign of the Void turns a single thought toward all beings,
Even hell hears the sound of the Great Dharma.
In an instant, they transcend the Three Realms’ dust,
Forever leaving the dark night’s forest of swords.

And [we] pray to deliver this departed spirit to the Land of Ultimate Bliss.
Burning incense to offer to the Lord of the Ninth Palace, the Flying Demons’ Transformative Perfected Lord—
Whom the world calls the Great King of the Capital.
Here, hells abound with saws, cauldrons, and boiling oil,
A thousand deaths and ten thousand rebirths—unceasing.

Only after a full year of death do they arrive at this palace.
The Heavenly Worthy, in transformation, universally aids all beings,
Greatly awakening compassion to save and deliver from suffering,
And recites a gatha:

**Heavenly Worthy of Jade Void Luminous Sovereign**

Once the yin gates close, light is forever lost,
The dark and boundless path stretches long.
How can word reach the floating world?
The Fengdu realm divides yin and yang.

Crimson-clad officials in towering hats preside over the execution grounds,
Ox-headed jailers tend the cauldrons of boiling oil.
Bowing to the Compassionate Lord who comes to save from suffering,
May we ride the deliverance to the immortal realm.

And [perform] inconceivable merits.

Thereupon, the Perfected One, having heard this gatha,
Trembled with awe and joy, praising without end.
Bowing to the Heavenly Worthy,
He chanted another gatha:

**Heavenly Worthy of Merit-Borne Transformation**

The Heavenly Worthy’s power is inconceivable,
All heavenly spirits rely upon it.
White talismans and true decrees descend to hell,
Their majestic light guides the souls along the path.

And [we] pray to deliver this departed spirit to the Land of Ultimate Bliss.
Burning incense to offer to the Lord of the Tenth Palace, the Five Spirits’ Majestic Virtue Perfected Lord—
Whom the world calls the Great King of the Turning Wheel.
All sinful souls, after the Great Mourning,
Arrive at this palace.

The Heavenly Worthy, in compassion, delivers the departed spirits,
And recites a gatha:

**Heavenly Worthy of True Sovereign and Cavern Spirit**

The Sovereign of the Void expounds the teachings, revealing the true essence,
Universally delivering all beings with karmic affinity.
Those who fulfill their practice ascend to the formless realm,
Those with deep karmic roots sink into the underworld springs.

Carefree, they feast in the Golden Flower Palace,
Knowing through kalpas the sight of the field of blessings.
All dark souls are liberated,
Shedding the heavy mist to behold the blue sky.

And [perform] inconceivable merits.

Thereupon, the Perfected One, having heard this gatha,
Praised without end,
And chanted another gatha:

**Heavenly Worthy of Jeweled Flower Perfection**

The Heavenly Worthy, in pity, saves the deluded masses,
The dark souls of nine nights all emerge.
Directly ascending to the Southern Palace, all receive deliverance,
Universally gathering to enter the realm of non-action.

And [we] pray to deliver this departed spirit to the Land of Ultimate Bliss.

The Heavenly Worthy declared:
All beings, after death, pass through hell,
Their souls bound to Fengdu, enduring every torment—
Constant interrogations, knife mountains, slicing blades,
Bronze pillars, iron beds, scorching flames, and freezing ice,
Unending suffering and affliction.

Now, for you, I chant the precious gatha,
Raising boundless sounds that resound through the ten directions,
Their voices reaching the nine earths,
All interrogations dissolve, and all are liberated.
The souls, refined, ascend directly to the Southern Palace,
Kalpa after kalpa, life after life, dwelling forever in bliss.

The Heavenly Worthy’s gathas and the names of the Ten Kings have been recited,
The merit is complete,
Delivering the departed [Name],
To be reborn in the heavenly realm.

We pray that by this wondrous fruit,
All transgressions be absolved,
Swiftly leaving the dark land,
Directly reaching the path of rebirth.
May blessings flow to the present,
Bringing joy to the household.
May all sentient beings
Together ascend the shore of the Dao.

Recitation of sutras, proclamation of petitions, as before—dedicated.
The Rite for Deliverance by the Ten Kings of Hell is now complete.
