**Ritual of the Lamp for the Stove Lord of the Eastern Kitchen**
The ritual proceeds according to form.

Today, incense is burned and lamps are lit to make offerings to the original Stove Lord of the Eastern Kitchen, the Stove Lords of the Five Directions and Five Emperors, the Ladies of the Five Emperor Stove Lords, the Divine Stove of the Celestial Kitchen, the Spirit Stove of the Earthly Kitchen, the thirty-six Stove Lords, the Stove Lords of new and old hearths, the Spirit Mother of Cooking and Washing, the General of Water Transport, and all the majestic spirits of the stove’s taboos.

By the power of this true incense, universal offerings are made.

It is heard that Heaven is the lord of all spirits, punishing excess and rewarding virtue; the stove is the master of a household, correcting errors and restraining faults. Since its office is not trivial, reverence for it should be profound. On this auspicious morning, we humbly present our sincerest devotion. Though osmanthus wine has yet to fill the golden goblet, orchid incense is first kindled in the precious tripod. May our prayers ascend without obstruction, and may resonance be achieved.

Today, the officiant [Name] has renovated the distant kitchen and hearth, rebuilding the chimney and renewing all. Fearing offense to the divine overseers, we respectfully offer this rite of pacification and gratitude.

May our foolish sincerity reach above, and may the sagely intent be secretly moved. Gazing before us, who could fail to see the rites of veneration? Sacrificing as if the spirits were present, we must uphold the utmost sincerity. Having received the petition’s words, we now present the offering of gathered herbs. The assembly takes refuge in devotion, reverently chanting praises.

**Invocation of the Sacred Name.**

Incense is kindled and lamps are lit, in offering to the Original Tone’s Eastern Kitchen Controller of Destiny, the Stove Lord of the Eastern Blue-green Emperor Jia-Yi, and all the taboo deities of the hearth household.

We have heard that the Controller of Destiny holds a revered name, entrusted by the Supreme Emperor with the mandate to oversee; the Stove God’s office is weighty, wielding authority over the fortunes of the common people. His transformations are manifold, his words beyond full recounting. In heaven, he serves as the Messenger of the Seven Primes, reporting daily all matters to the imperial court. Each hearth bears a distinct name, while the Five Directions may be called the Five Emperors. Their domains are divided, alternately governing yin and yang. Though good and evil alike depend on cultivation, right and wrong are invariably recorded with impartiality.

Today, the officiant [Name], presuming to summon the sagely presence, respectfully presents fragrant libations. We pray that what is seen and heard shall be faithfully reported—what is written, let it be written; what is erased, let it be erased—so that heavenly grace may abundantly flow.

Bowing in reverence, we devoutly chant praises:
*Azure spirit, apportioned qi, Blue-green Emperor, august deity.
Above, you receive the imperial mandate; below, you scrutinize human affairs.
Deeds are recorded, transgressions noted; merits are rewarded, names memorialized.
Daily your brush records, ceaselessly your work proceeds.
Reverence brings blessings; recklessness invites misfortune.
With bowed head, we offer thanks, praying for peace and tranquility.*

Incense is kindled and lamps are lit, in offering to the Original Tone’s Eastern Kitchen Controller of Destiny, the Stove Lord of the Southern Red Emperor Bing-Ding, and all the taboo deities of the hearth household.

We have heard that the Six Gods revered in the hearth are indeed exalted; none among the people fail to depend on the three daily meals, which are likewise bound to heaven. Yet reflecting on our daily conduct, not all may be deemed upright. Today, the officiant [Name], entangled in worldly customs and bound by the ties of nurture and affection, quietly tends the steamer and pot, ever awaiting the boiling of water and the cooking of fire. Roasting and grilling give rise to foul odors; washing and rinsing scatter grains. Wielding knives and axes without regard for weight, burning grass and firewood without care for defilement. Scales and fur are mistakenly scorched; dung and straw are carelessly cast. Drunken revelry and loud voices, incantations and curses, baring flesh before the hearth, clamor in the kitchen precincts. Such offenses defy summary in a single word, countless sins beyond enumeration.

Now, incense is burned and libations poured, water is offered with flowers. Trembling, we confess our faults; earnestly, we seek extraordinary blessings. We but pray for wealth to span generations, our sacrifices not unworthy of Yin Zifang; may we not incur heavenly wrath, nor vainly seek favor like Wangsun Jia.

Bowing in reverence, we devoutly chant praises:
*Vermilion spirit, true qi, Red Emperor, august deity.
Seated in the Li position, guardian of the sacred hearth.
Bestowing blessings, averting calamities,
Binding the Nine Uglies, burning demonic spirits.
Those who defy us perish; those who revere us thrive.
We issue this decree—let all the people obey.*

Incense is kindled and lamps are lit, in offering to the Original Tone’s Eastern Kitchen Controller of Destiny, the Stove Lord of the Western White Emperor Geng-Xin, and all the taboo deities of the hearth household.

We have heard that in summer, offerings to the ancestors begin with the lungs, as detailed in *Lü’s Ordinances*; cinnabar transforms to gold, as recounted in the *Book of Han*. Every household has its hearth—how could one not reverently sacrifice? For the celestial bureaus receive the words reported, and in the human realm, transgressions accumulate into faults. From old to young, none are exempt; from minor to grave, how can offenses be excused?

Today, the officiant [Name], wandering the dusty world, this fleeting fire-dwelling, unaware of taboos, no wonder his face is powdered and rouged; courting disaster, he ever fears scorched heads and blistered brows. Having bathed in vast mercy and received pardon, how dare we forget humble rites to return reverence? Sweeping away all misfortune, we invoke the Five Blessings. With protective divine objects, no malevolent spirits shall assail. Demons of fever pass by our door, never entering our home; bands of evil, though their voices are heard, remain unseen. May the calamities of clanging pots and shrieking axes cease; may the omens of fawning dogs and lurking foxes vanish.

Bowing in reverence, we devoutly chant praises:
*Radiant and mighty spirit, White Emperor, august deity.
Receiving the imperial mandate, wielding authority over all spirits.
Overseeing the mortal realm, attending the Nine Pures above.
Seated in the Dui palace, nurturing all life.
Transforming evil into good, pardoning sins while preserving grace.
Dispelling myriad disasters, bestowing the mystic wind of virtue.*

Incense is kindled and lamps are lit, in offering to the Original Tone’s Eastern Kitchen Controller of Destiny, the Stove Lord of the Northern Black Emperor Ren-Gui, and all the taboo deities of the hearth household.

We have heard that the people regard food as heaven; without a hearth, how can one cook? The hearth is heaven’s officer, charged with recording merits and misfortunes. By this sacred rite, we respectfully present our offerings.

Today, the officiant [Name], fearing his household’s unease and the accumulation of grievous faults—where even a single good deed is left undone, a single word cannot suffice—has turned inward in reflection, surely able to transform misfortune into fortune. We pray for the sweeping away of ill omens, that we may ever abide in auspiciousness; for the banishment of malevolent spirits, that our years may flourish like the sacred tree.

Bowing in reverence, we devoutly chant praises:
*In the Ren-Gui position, Dark Elder, august deity.
Celestial spirit, mighty saint; earthly spirit, martial general.
Ever attending at our side, heeding commands and acting.
A thousand fathoms tall, hands cradling heaven and earth.
Dwelling in rivers and seas, mastering the fire spirits.
Heed our divine incantation—may we forever preserve purity and peace.*

Incense is kindled and lamps are lit, in offering to the Original Tone’s Eastern Kitchen Controller of Destiny, the Stove Lord of the Central Yellow Emperor Wu-Ji, and all the taboo deities of the hearth household.

We have heard that his office in the human realm is most intimate to the people; his appointment in heaven is an honor bestowed by the Emperor.

Daily he governs destiny—his charge is no light one;
As "Prefect-Lord" he is called—his title bears true weight.
His office oversees the kitchen, his authority holds the center.

Now, this officiant, so-and-so, dwelling between heaven and earth,
beneath the radiance of sun and moon,
unaware and unknowing,
what fear, what refusal could there be?
Drunk and wanton, stripped bare in reckless abandon,
words carelessly invoking spirits, incantations idly drawn,
foul odors assailing, tainted hands feeding the fire—
such habits become the daily norm,
while unseen, the spirits record all.
No merit, though slender as a hair;
transgressions, vast as mountains.

We humbly pray that the hundred spirits surround and protect,
that the ten thousand virtues lend their aid.
Send forth true qi from the five directions,
sweeping away demonic afflictions;
fan auspicious winds through every household,
transforming all into waves of grace.

Bowing in reverence, we devoutly chant praises:
*August spirit of the Yellow and the Old,
Emperor of Wu-Ji.
Dwelling in the central position,
overseeing the eight directions.
Governing the ten thousand forms,
none transgress his order.
Rewarding good and punishing evil,
bestowing blessings beyond measure.
Should any demonic force arise,
it shall vanish into the earth.
Guard and secure this household,
forever extinguishing calamity.*

The recitation of scriptures, the proclamation of petitions, and the dedication of merit conclude the Lamp Rite of the Eastern Kitchen Controller of Destiny.
