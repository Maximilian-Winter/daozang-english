**Volume the First**
**Preface to the Teachings**
**Repentance Ritual**

Offering incense to the Daoist Emperor, hoping that my humble sincerity may reach the heavens;
Sending fragrant offerings to the gods, relying on the rising *qi* (氤氲) to ascend.

With reverence, I present the *Dao* incense, the *virtue/power* (德) incense, the *wisdom* (慧) incense, the *non-action* (無為) incense, the *purity and tranquility* (清靜) incense, the *natural* (自然) incense, the *wondrous primordial truth* (妙洞真) incense, the *transcendent Three Realms* (超三界) incense, and the *Three Realms of Truth* (三境真) incense. These fill the celestial palace of jade and golden lights, pervade the *Dharma Realm* (法界) of the entire cosmos, and universally extend offerings.

The preceptor of this Sutra is the **Primordial Sovereign of the Beginning of Dao** (元始天尊) who embraces and presents the **Celestial Jade Emperor, Lord of the Dao** (玉帝道君天尊), the **Sage of the Transmitted Holy Teachings, Born from the Dao** (流演聖教降生天尊), the **Celestial Jade Emperor, Great Sage of All Heavenly Manifestations** (諸天化身玉皇大天尊), and the **Highest Celestial Sovereign of the Mysterious Vault** (玄穹高上帝). The **Emperor-Father of Radiant Majesty and Wondrous Joy** (帝父光嚴妙樂國王), the **Empress-Mother of Precious Moonlight, the Celestial Consort** (帝母寶月光皇后), and the **Awakened King of Purity and Naturalness, the Sage of Highest Emptiness and Clarity** (清靜自然覺王如來高虛清明天主帝君).

I respectfully invoke the **Highest Celestial Sovereign of Jade Emptiness** (玉虚上帝), the **Supreme Celestial Sovereign of the Boundless Heaven** (昊天上帝), the **Great Bodhisattvas of the Golden Immortals across the Three Ages** (三世金仙大乘菩薩), the **Boundless Saints of Ten Directions** (十方至聖無量帝君), the **Primordial Ancestors of Heaven and Earth** (天地始祖五老上帝), the **Four Great True Persons of Responsive Mercy, Compassionate Liberation, Deliverance of Life and Death, and Infinite Blessings for Protection** (寻聲救苦、慈悲度厄、濟生度死、萬福護身四大真人), the **Luminous Jade Maiden** (夜光玉女), and the **All Primordial Lords** (一切元君). All the **Celestial True Persons of the Pure and Natural** (天真皇人一切大仙), the **Aid-Sage, Lord of the Northern Pole, Mysterious Celestial Sovereign** (北極佑聖真君玄天上帝), the **Nine-Heaven Exalted Lawmasters of Teaching and Assisting the Primordial** (三天扶教輔元大法天師), the **Nine-Heaven Sovereign of Manifestation and Response, Lord of the Spirit’s Answer** (九天開化主宰靈應帝君), the **Sovereign of Pure and Correct Enlightenment, Lord of Benevolent Aid** (演正警化純陽孚佑帝君), the **True Person of Responsive Compassion and Wondrous Communication, Lord of Benevolent Rescue** (應感妙通慈濟朱真人), the **True Person of the Mysterious Dao and Benevolent Guidance, Jade Hare White Sage** (洞玄惠世玉蟾白真人), the **Great Sage of Universal Benevolence, Infinite Mercy, and Manifested Aid, Lord of Extensive Protection** (大慈永元普濟顯靈廣佑羅真君), and the **Ancestral Sages of all stages—Pure and Mysterious, Spirit Treasure, Dao Virtue, and Rectified Unity** (清微、靈寶、道德、正一諸階演法垂文授受諸大祖師真人仙眾), as well as the **Celestial Marshals of Thunderous Authority** (雷霆諸司天將), the **clerks and soldiers of the Daoist talismans** (法箓吏兵), the **Mystic Sage of the Boundless Flight, Lord of Wondrous Conduct** (飛天大聖無極神王妙行真人), the **Spiritual Consorts and Jade Maidens** (靈妃玉女), the **Great True Persons of Ten Directions, Three Realms, and All Heavenly and Earthly Waters** (十方三界、諸天地水諸大真人), and the **Infinite Sacred Assembly present in this gathering** (一時會中、無量聖眾).

All kneel with devout hearts, offering incense in accordance with the ritual.
The **Daoist official of talismans** (具箓職臣某) humbly records and presents this to the **disciple of the Great Dao** (奉大道弟子某等), with utmost sincerity and piety.

**My Humble Petition**
I, a disciple of the Dao residing in the [certain] prefecture, [certain] county, and [certain] locality (臣今奏為某府某縣某處居), with sincere devotion (奉道臣某 所伸凡悃), dare to offend the celestial authority (干冒天威), and with reverence, seek the Emperor’s boundless mercy (仰望洪慈), while humbly following the ritual of incense (俯從丹祷).

On this auspicious day of the fifth month (谷旦), I present my offerings with utmost sincerity (式展刍忱), arranging incense and flowers in devotion (香花羅列以歸依), setting forth lamps and fruits for universal sustenance (燈果廣陳而供養). I humbly pray for a temporary respite from the celestial court (恭望暫離帝闕), so that the Emperor may graciously descend to this mortal assembly (款駐凡筵).

Looking down upon my earnest sincerity (俯察精虔), the Emperor beholds the gratitude of the humble (鑒苹蘩之報謝).
Piercing my heartfelt pleas (洞矜懇切), the Emperor responds to the sincerity of the lowly (副草芥之微誠).

With reverence, I face the divine mercy (恭對天慈), proclaiming and extolling the method of repentance (宣揚忏法).

Thus, may **heavenly and human beings** rejoice,
And **guilt and retribution** be **cleansed and removed** (罪咎之蠲除).

Your humble servants, with devoted hearts, prostrate before the Divine:
Prostrate our bodies and our lives, O Jade Emperor, Great Sovereign of Heaven, Supreme Lord of the High Vault!

With deep reflection upon our disciples, we bow our heads in reverence before Your Benevolent Countenance,
And pour our hearts into the Marvelous Law.

Though we strive with sincere mortal devotion, we are moved by the boundless **virtue/power** of the Saints.
We recite the **Seventeen Lights of Devotion**—each word uplifted to the Highest Sovereign;
And offer **Tenfold Homage**—each sound prostrated before the Heavenly Lord.

Though our voices differ, none may know—
How can we hope to be heard in unison?

The Dao is the ultimate principle,
Heaven is the greatest expanse—
All follow the teachings to cultivate and practice,
And thus, in accordance with the scriptures, we extol and declare.

Wondrous knowledge and wondrous insight,
Without equal, beyond comparison.

May we raise our voices to praise the **Ten Names of the Dao**,
And all transgressions recorded in the celestial ledger shall fall away;
May we proclaim the **One Supreme Good**,
And all good deeds held in our hearts shall flourish.

Today, all revere the **Mysterious Merit**,
And partake of the Law’s feast beneath the **Dao’s Auspicious Shade**,
Where benevolence and harmony prevail,
And wisdom and eloquence shine forth.

With gradual growth in accordance with our hearts,
And step-by-step fulfillment of our wishes,
We bring benefit to all **Ten Directions and Three Realms**,
And rescue all **Six Paths and Four Generations**.

With all sentient beings,
We attain the **Supreme Path**.

Your humble servants, with devoted hearts, bow and give thanks to the **Supreme, Most True Three Treasures**.

The **Second Volume of the Jade Emperor’s Fulfilled Wishes and Sacred Repentance** ends,
The **Third Volume of the Jade Emperor’s Fulfilled Wishes and Sacred Repentance** begins—

With reverence, we present offerings to the Emperor:
We hope to **purify our sins** through **potent incense** and **subtle transmission**;

Offering incense and sighing in reverence,
Extending our earnest pleas that You, in Your mercy, regard the common folk.

Abandoning all delusion;

Offering gratitude to the Supreme Void’s Three Treasures of Highest Truth.

Within the Radiant and Auspicious Realm of Mellow Joy,
The Holy Mother conceived in the Void,
And the Dao Lord bestowed the child in a dream.
With loving kindness and humility,
She did not covet the glory of ten thousand chariots;
With patience and gentleness,
She did not weary of countless eons of cultivation.

Ten titles were fulfilled, ten thousand virtues complete—
As the Heavenly Sovereign of supreme majesty,
And the Awakened One of great enlightenment.
Her merit is unparalleled, her virtue unsurpassed—
Great Saint, Great Compassionate,
Great Merciful, Great Benevolent—
Unprecedented in the past, beyond all praise.

Your servants, with hearts full of devotion, cannot sufficiently extol and pray.
May all past ancestors, living kin, beings of the dusty world,
And souls in the endless night,
With reverence, take refuge and pay homage,
Proclaim Your name, and meditate on Your form,
As the scriptures command, and as we pray in accordance with the teachings.

**All assembled,**
The Emperor’s decree, once more:
Your servants, with hearts of devotion, take refuge in the divine,
Surrender body and life to the Jade Emperor, Great Heavenly Lord,
Highest Lord of the Mysterious Vault.

We deeply reflect that your servants, as disciples of such-and-such,
Have defied the Dao/Way and betrayed truth,
From birth into death, amassing sins beyond measure,
Through deeds that stray from the righteous path.

Boundless and endless are the countless sins and obstacles;
Too vast to contemplate, too numerous to recall are the offenses across countless lifetimes.
How dare we not harbor remorse in our hearts?
Thus, we must surrender to our unrestrained nature.

With humble submission and earnest supplication,
We pray for Your compassionate regard,
Baring our heads with all our might to confess,
Never concealing nor hiding our faults again.

With deepest hope for Your gracious pardon and mercy,
We earnestly pray to bathe in Your compassion.

May our threefold deeds and seven emotions
Be wholly cleansed through sincere praise and repentance;
May the ten evils and five grievous offenses
Be utterly expiated through prostration and supplication.

Let us become exemplary beings without fault,
And fulfill the final age with unyielding devotion.
Ascend from the mundane to behold the sacred,
And align with the Dao/Way in its true essence.

May blessings extend to the Six Paths and Three Realms,
And grace reach the Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors.
Through the power of Your radiant light,
Let all dusty sins be utterly dissolved.

With few regrets and no transgressions,
May we attain perfect virtue and beauty.

With utmost sincerity, we bow in homage
And gratefully acknowledge the Supreme Void Sovereign’s Three Treasures.

With sincere hearts, we submit—
Submit our spirits, our bodies, our fates—
To the Three Pure Ones of Ultimate Truth,
The Sovereign Jade Emperor,
The Celestial Father, the Celestial Mother,
The Most Sacred, the Most True,
The Three Treasures of the Three Realms,
All true spirits.

With deepest reflection, we, your humble disciples, acknowledge that our karmic bonds remain unsevered and demonic obstacles unbroken. Alas, the folly of mortal ignorance prevents us from practicing the wondrous Dao with sincerity. Thus, external malevolence corrupts our sacred roots, while thieves of divine treasure disrupt our sublime Way, ensnaring us in the mundane net and casting us into the realm of the profane. How then could we clarify our thoughts and concentrate our spirits, lest we be ensnared by attachments and chase after transient phenomena?

The One True Essence is lost, and myriad demons assail us. We humbly implore the Celestial Sovereign’s boundless compassion to proclaim the wondrous law that severs obstacles. Thus, we earnestly petition and, according to the scriptures, confess our transgressions. May we be cleansed of all defilements, that our inner essence may shine luminous and clear; may the veils of illusion be swept away, that our enlightened vision may radiate brilliance. May we wield the sword of wisdom to sever our faults, removing the obstacles of affliction while recording our virtues. May our mortal forms be purified, our Dao’s fruition complete. May blessings permeate both the seen and unseen realms, and wisdom illuminate the singular nature of enlightenment. As the darkness dissipates and the sun shines forth, as clouds scatter and the sky clears—may we forever attain boundless freedom, free from all cycles of rebirth.

With sincere hearts, we prostrate and gratefully acknowledge the Supreme Void Sovereign, the Three Pure Ones of Ultimate Truth.

Humbly, we observe the fast and purify ourselves before the Emperor, hoping that our sincerity may subtly penetrate the divine.

With deepest sincerity, we present our heartfelt wishes, hoping they may be granted. On this auspicious day of the fifth month, we express our devout intentions.

Facing the Primordial Mercy, we proclaim the confession law. We, the assembly of the Daoist gathering, each with focused minds, kneel in reverence and perform the confession as prescribed.

**Recorded by the ordained disciple [name], led by the official [name], sincerely and devoutly presenting to the Three Pure Ones of Supreme Holiness, the Jade Sovereign of Highest Majesty, the Celestial Father and Mother, the Most Sacred and True, the Three Treasures of the Three Realms, all true spirits.**

We, your humble disciples, have heard that in past lives, you were the royal heir, toiling to cultivate the profound Dao and rescue countless beings over the three thousand aeons. Through the sacred body, you nurtured the embryonic essence of life; though your Dharma body was the original source of the Way, you transformed and manifested without end. Unparalleled and supreme, you ride the highest vehicle, your profound principles reaching the utmost depths, your imperial virtues vast and mighty. Unbroken and undying, you vanish yet remain, your great compassion and great mercy, your great pity and great aspiration unmatched and beyond measure.

With boundless reverence, we humbly pray and extol your virtues, extending this grace to all past ancestors, living kin, beings of the dusty world, and souls in the endless night. With deepest devotion, we take refuge, pay homage, chant your names, and visualize your forms, following your teachings and invoking blessings as the scriptures prescribe.

Unable to evade the influence of our fate stars and the flow of destiny;

and in the dusty world, may we encounter auspicious gatherings.

并与同居诸眷，更为在世群生。

**All** [prostrate],
**The Imperial Edict of the **Celestial Sovereign****,
**One recitation.**
**With sincere devotion, we surrender to the **Divine** and to the **Body** and **Command** of the Dao,**
**The **Great Celestial Emperor of Heaven****, **The **Highest Sovereign of the Mystic Vault****.
**The **Celestial Sovereign** ponders deeply that each of us, your humble disciples, holds sincere intentions—**
**How could there be any who do not wish?**

How could there be but one heart when all desires differ?
Each holds their own longings—some seek to save the people and benefit all beings,
Yet what is truly essential is to seek the Dao and attain the True.

Those bound in suffering only wish for advancement,
The poor and destitute long for wealth and honor,
Ever waiting until their desires are fulfilled before release.

Yet, contemplating the wondrous Dao’s boundless compassion,
It grants all sentient beings their deepest wishes.

Thus, we dare to surrender our lives,
Seeking to follow the will of others.

Humbly, we pray for Your gracious inspection of our sincere devotion,
Still relying on the Dao’s adaptability to respond to our needs.

First, we pray for the protection of the nation and its people;
Next, we hope to benefit others while benefiting ourselves.

Whether in the unseen or the seen,
From ancient times to the present,
May all living descendants be cherished in peace,
And all ancestors past be universally liberated.

May blessings reach the Nine Hells and dispel their suffering,
And merit shine through the endless night.

Together with all beings, may we depend on the multitude of virtues.

With sincere devotion, we prostrate and give thanks to the **Supreme Void Sovereign of the Three Jewels**.

**Dedication:**
As human nature is dutiful, may those who do good receive a hundred blessings;
As the Emperor’s mercy is boundless, may Heaven’s aid rest upon **virtue alone**.

Previously, we, the disciples of the Dao, reverently addressed the Great Way,
Bowing in homage before You, presenting the *Supreme Scripture of the Mystic Vault’s Highest Treasure: The Celestial Sovereign’s Fulfilled Wish and Expiation*, in its entirety—ten volumes complete.

May this merit be dedicated solely for disciple [name]’s repentance, dispelling calamity, prolonging life, and gathering joyous fortune.

Humbly, we pray that human sentiment may resonate with the Divine,
And that the Celestial Sovereign may observe and grant our wishes.

May obstacles be removed, sins atoned,
And all desires fulfilled to their utmost.
May disasters be averted and blessings gathered,
And the Mystic Virtue attain perfect fruition.

Together with all sentient beings,
May we attain the **Supreme Dao**,
Take refuge in the Three Jewels,
And dedicate ourselves to the Nine Purity Realms,
As the supreme cause and condition,
With sincere devotion, we invoke:

**The Most Holy Primordial Celestial Sovereign,**
**The Sovereign of the Highest Clarity’s Treasure,**
**The Sovereign of the Supreme Dao’s Virtue,**
**The Celestial Sovereign Who Forgives Transgressions.**

**Unfathomable, boundless merit.**

*The Tenth Volume of the Highest Treasure: The Celestial Sovereign’s Fulfilled Display and Expiation* is now complete.
