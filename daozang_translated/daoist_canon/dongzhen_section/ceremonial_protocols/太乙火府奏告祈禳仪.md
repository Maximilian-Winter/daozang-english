**Liturgical Petition to the Fire Bureau of the Great One for Prayer and Exorcism**

Proceed with ethereal steps,
Burn the talisman in the water vessel to purge defilement.

The Great Void has no form,
Purity and filth alike are empty.
False perceptions arise in an instant,
Worldly entanglements contend in their wake.
Since this is no true realm,
It is but a demonic palace.
Thus, in practice and discipline,
One must first sweep clean.

With reverence, we present the true talisman and summon:
The Nine Phoenixes, Great Generals of Defilement-Breaking;
The Mighty Divine Beings of the Eight Directions;
The Envoys of the *Qianluo Danna* and the Cavernous *Gang* of the Supreme Mystery;
The Divine Lords of the Five Dragons of the Five Directions;
The Lady of the Flowery Pond and the Ritual Ablution;
The Emissaries of the Azure Waters in Brocade Robes;
The Generals Who Devour Demons and Consume Ghosts;
The Bronze-Headed, Iron-Faced Mounted Officers;
The Immortal Spirits who bear the registers of the Daoist precepts;
The Officers Who Resolve Defilement and Harmonize the *Gan*—
All are respectfully invited to heed the primordial descent,
To assemble at the sacred precinct,
To spread *qi* and invoke the spirits,
To cast bells and hurl fire,
To transform the dharma-water,
To purge the foul *qi* from the eight limits,
To sever and annihilate demonic essences,
To spread the true wind across the ten poles,
To make the myriad spirits tremble in submission,
To purify the ten directions,
To clear the heavens of miasmic defilement,
To cleanse the earth of demonic dust,
To illumine the darkness with wisdom,
To embrace the vastness of the mysterious and profound—
All as commanded.

**Next:** Recitation of the *Divine Incantation for the Purity of Heaven and Earth*, followed by the raising of the floral offering.

The master performs the triple bow and offers incense.

The Dao is studied in the heart,
Faith is conveyed through the fragrant smoke.
Holding the jade censer,
The heart abides in the Nine Heavens.
The true spirits gaze downward,
The immortal sieves descend to the hall.
All that your servant now petitions,
May it be granted as spoken.

Kneeling in silent invocation.

Reflecting upon this unworthy servant’s meager merits, I have presumptuously intruded upon the profound mysteries, yet remain without accomplishment in aiding others, and bear transgressions in my duties. In this humble position, I have only received the submitted petitions—how dare I ever forget to beseech your mandates?

With this present offering, for so-and-so, who reverently follows the ritual teachings, solemnly establishes the Star Altar, kindles the Dipper’s lamps in likeness, and casts talismans for divination—

May the loftiness of Heaven and the remoteness of the stars deign to respond to this single devotion as though descending in full assembly;
May the vastness of Earth and the depths of rivers and seas not scorn these halting steps, but grant their presence in completion;
Like pearls suspended or millet grains arrayed, may the ritual unfold as a forest of soaring branches—
May the post-horses pause and the chariot teams halt, encircling the altar in the form of coiled dragons, while jade pendants chime and sashes drape in ordered ranks like egrets in flight, to hear the sacred liturgy and together ascend the wondrous Dao.

This humble servant, presuming upon your majesty, prostrates himself in utmost trepidation and reverence. With bowed head and repeated bows, he respectfully declares:

Invoke the Heavenly Worthies for Disaster-Dispelling and Calamity-Resolving.
Summon the Generals—ignite and burn the Command Talismans for Descent.
Call forth the Community Deities and the Six Spirits.
Heavenly Numinous! Heavenly Numinous! Mighty spirits of the Three Realms!
Woodland specters and wayward ghosts—be reduced to fine dust by this command!
Wind, Thunder, and Rain Departments, the Divine Kings of the Four Waterways,
The True Lords of the Five Peaks—each guard the altar’s bounds.
Distinguish and transmit these petitions upward to the Jade Clarity.

Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees of the Great Crimson Heavenly Emperor!

Summon the Four Generals.
By edict of the Upper Clarity, swiftly call forth the Thunder Gods!
The Four Generals of the Altar’s Guard—hasten to overthrow all obstacles!
The Five Peaks and Four Waterways—heed this mighty summons!
Hasten to descend, each taking your place in the palace halls.
Receive the talisman and execute the command, presenting your report before the Jade Clarity.

Swiftly, swiftly, by decree of the Great Crimson Heavenly Emperor!

Heavenly Soldiers! Heavenly Soldiers! Earthly Numinous! Earthly Numinous!
As yin and yang converge, let the Thunder Department manifest its form!
Solemnly summon the Four Great Heavenly Generals—Gao, Tao, Cui, and Zhao—to swiftly arrive at the altar.
Visualize their presence at the four corners.

Invoke the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Communication and Response.

Summon Xie Bai. Burn the talisman.

In the profound and obscure, heaven and earth are born as one.
Divine transformations swift and fleeting, gathering to take form.
At the call, instantly arrive; at the summons, swiftly attend.
Swiftly, swiftly, by decree of the Great Crimson Heavenly Emperor.

Now I submit this memorial—before the altar, heed and await.
All petitions and wishes shall be conveyed to the imperial presence.
On this day, the talismanic attendant Xie Youbai follows the master’s command.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Great Crimson Heavenly Emperor’s salvation decree.

*Zi* appears at *wen*, *wu* emerges at *chū*.
Invoke the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Communication and Response.

Oṃ dou hūṃ hūṃ—Brahma’s response, thunder’s roar, all is seized.
Oṃ xìng jiū pán tuó lì—seize the ghosts and spirits under heaven.
By the master’s command, swiftly as fire, urgently obey the Great Crimson Heavenly Emperor’s decree.

*Wu* appears at *wen*. Visualize their arrival.
Having received the summons, they have bathed and come.
Today, on behalf of so-and-so, I humbly request:
Compose your majestic dignity, guard and shield the altar’s sanctity.
Open the gates of heaven, seal the doors of earth.
Secure the passes of tigers and leopards.
Ascend to the imperial court, treading upon cloud roots.
Draw near the dragon and phoenix chariots.
Enhance the radiance of divine favor, silently align with numinous blessings.

Invoke the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Truth, Expounder of the Teachings.

Descend, Master.

To learn without a master—profound principles are difficult to grasp alone.
Teaching must be upright; the supreme Dao is wondrously transmitted heart-to-heart.
Vessels and channels flow as one; lineage branches continue unbroken.
Thus did the Most High solemnly establish the rites of transmission.
Hence later generations deeply revere succession.
For all who take refuge, how dare we forget to invoke and report?

We, the disciples under your gate, together with the officiating officers,
In silent contemplation of the master’s chamber,
With sincere devotion, bow and invoke:
Ancestral Master Feng the Perfected of the Purple Mansion, Initiator of the Teachings;
Ancestral Master Chen the Perfected of Pure Simplicity and Wondrous Dao, the Recluse;
Ancestral Master Liu the Perfected, Supreme Minister of the Great Ultimate, Communicator of the Mysteries;
Ancestral Master Xu the Perfected, Central Heaven’s Pivot, Subduer of Demons;
Ancestral Master Yang the Perfected, Cloud-Clad Recluse of Qingyin;
Ancestral Master Huang the Perfected, True Constant Master Yunzhuang of Pucheng;
Lineage Master Ye the Perfected of Yutian, Wind and Rain Commander of the Western Terrace;
And all the successive masters of the Fire Mansion who have expounded and propagated the teachings.
We reverently hope for the master’s compassion, to deign to take notice.
May your clarity and brilliance be heard, embodied in talismans and auspicious signs through the ages.
May dreams convey the sacred mother’s numinous script, grandly manifesting in the Kaiyuan era.
May the leaves of the jiao altar be moved, and extraordinary omens appear to the Supreme One.
The texts of the stone chamber, hidden in the Shu capital’s lineage.
The Most High Lord Lao renewed and came forth—
Beneath the mountain, the green ox demoness was captured and dragged to the well’s iron chain.
The literary star shines auspiciously; the Pivot Mansion stores good fortune.
By day, fire flows and the sky swells—emptiness reveals its transformations.
By night, colored clouds thread the Dipper—treading light, the spirit soars.
Those who inherit from Pucheng may be guides and markers.
Those who continue from Yutian are worthy of emulation.
At a whistle, winds churn and thunder roars; at a gesture, rain ceases and winds still.
Inscribed in the eight-character family record, eternally bestowing generation after generation.
Crowned with the Daoist arts of all ranks, flourishing through descendants without end.

On this evening, we reverently pray:
Jade pendants chime, rosy clouds drift in the ethereal distance.
Descending from the celestial thoroughfare, transcending the dust of the mortal world.
With utmost care, we humbly present this to be heard.

Invoke the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao, the Scriptures, the Master, and the Treasures.
Offer incense to behold the Master.

The Cloud Chariot scatters flowers, offers tea—
[Rank and Name], with utmost reverence, humbly petitions:
The Founding Masters who inaugurated the teachings—Master Feng of the Purple Mansion, Master Chen of Profound Stillness, Master Liu of Penetrating Mystery, Master Xu the Demon-Queller—and all the successive Masters of the Fire Mansion who transmitted the Dao, conferred the methods, and propagated the lineage—
we reverently gaze upon your compassion, humbly beseeching your regard and remembrance.

We have heard that the Dao you preserved and the lineage you upheld extend far through the veins and channels, their virtue and teachings reaching perfection, their models enduring through the refining and shaping of generations.

Today, on behalf of [Name], we submit this plea, casting our lot with the Dipper’s pole, aligning with the stars’ celestial course.

We reflect with deep concern that we, mere remnants of the Mystery Gate, dwell in a realm of sparse talent. Our names are presumptuously appended to the immortal ranks, yet we have repeatedly violated the precepts and failed to comprehend the statutes and regulations of our ancestral teachings. We have recklessly usurped the practices, and without guidance, how could we hope to evoke a response?

We beseech your assent to the matters herein petitioned. May the Dipper’s decrees be proclaimed and disseminated, the stellar courts command their subordinates, the offices of Mystery respond in echo, and the generals whose destinies align with this mandate move in unison—form and shadow following, the steps of the *gang* connecting with the numinous, the talismans proving efficacious.

We, in our lowly station, are utterly without recourse, our devotion in prayer reaching its utmost. We speak with reverence.

Invoke the Heavenly Worthy of the Seven Primes’ Protective Cover

The Lamp’s Radiance—
We have heard that the Dipper governs the Seven Primes, wielding the power of life, death, and illumination. The lamps, divided into five colors, reveal the mechanisms of fortune and misfortune. Their light illumines the human realm while their station resides in the heavens. By the red talismans, flames soar brilliantly; the celestial bodies above shine in unison with the radiant pole, as if the armillary sphere itself were in command. We humbly hope for a luminous response, that our devout prayers may be answered.

The Master kindles the lamp, the assembly chants the divine incantations—
The Master visualizes the Dipper’s alignment:
*"By the Supreme’s decree, the Dipper’s lamp is kindled.
The Seven Primes descend to save and deliver all beings.
Left Assistants and Right Aides manifest their mighty spirits.
Marshal Tianpeng commands the heavenly hosts.
The Envoys of the Five Thunders, the Six Jia and Six Ding.
The Great Sage Zhenwu, the Three Stars of the Terrace.
Dispel illness, eradicate misfortune, sever the heads of demonic spirits.
Those who defy the decree perish; those who obey it live.
The Dipper’s lamp shines—body and home are illuminated.
Fortune and longevity endure, ever preserving harmony.
The lamp’s radiance shines, guiding mortals to long life.
The three *hun* souls rest in health, the seven *po* souls in peace.
The bright lamp gathers light, wandering spirits do not flee.
The seven *po* souls remain secure, the myriad spirits all return.
In the Dipper’s luminous expanse, one dwells forever in splendor.
The Seven Primes descend, receiving the divine proclamation.
The lamp’s brightness or dimness reveals fortune or misfortune.
By the power of the mighty spirits, all wishes are fulfilled."*

The Talisman of the Basin is cast for divination—
We have heard that the clear and pure is the realm of divine water, and the attentive and receptive is the secret of the true talisman. By observing the movement within stillness, one may fathom the mechanisms of the sublime. We humbly pray that the light overflows with grace, the brush of fortune writes with spring’s warmth, and the pulse of life knows no end. Like a long-flowing river finding its course, may the direction we tread be brightly revealed.

The auspicious report and all documents are now to be proclaimed.

Proclaim the document, cast the basin, and summon the two messengers—
The Talisman is burned in the Fire Mansion of Taiyi to issue the summons:
*"The Dipper’s Star-Holding and Rāhu Messengers, the Dipper’s Attendant Officers, heed this proclamation and swiftly descend to the altar court.
Hasten by the decree of the Great Red Heavenly Emperor!"*

Within the Dipper, there are generals who assist the turning of the jade armillary, discerning good and punishing evil, scrutinizing transgressions and false words. The Jade Balance issues commands, its might reigning over the Jasper Pool. At our call, come swiftly as wind and fire to the altar’s base. Do not delay or disobey.
By the decree of the Great Red Heavenly Emperor, hasten!

Threefold Decree—
*"Oṃ! Cittī! Star Emperor Mahāsahā!
Duo sāhālī! Dītī! Juśahā!
Oṃ! [ ]! Cittī! Śeṣa!"*

Spirits of the Dipper’s midst, numinous powers of the stellar bodies—
To the left, you are Radiant; to the right, Wondrously True.
Your transformations are unfathomable, emerging from darkness and entering the unseen.
We now summon and invoke you—swiftly descend to the altar court.
By the decree of the Great Red Heavenly Emperor, hasten!

Visualize their descent.

The Master announces the matter—
The talismans are burned and combined:
Just now, the summons was issued, and we trust you have graciously descended. On this occasion, we, the altar’s host, perform the Dipper’s rites for [Name], to dissolve calamities and dispel misfortunes. We seek to welcome the celestial favor and extend our reverence. We dare to trouble your divine power to bear this combined talisman to the Dipper’s officials, requesting the descent of your benevolent radiance upon the lamp’s assembly, to be enacted in accordance with the decree. We await your luminous response with reverence.

Step the Dipper’s steps, visualize the dispatch—

The Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Communication and Response

[Rank and Name], together with the altar officers and the assembly, with united sincerity, humbly petition:
The Three Clarities’ August Sages, the Ten Poles’ Lofty Perfected, the Nine Sovereigns of the Northern Dipper, the myriad spirits and sages of the Four Mansion—
The Masters, Generals, and Marshals of the Fire Mansion, the deities observing the lamp’s feast—
we venture to offend your true compassion, humbly beseeching your luminous regard.

We have heard that burning incense returns to the void beneath the Flowery Canopy, its fragrant smoke already ascending in the sacred script. With minds stilled, we gaze toward the Northern Pole’s cinnabar clouds, longing to ride the golden chariot. Yet we remain in the desolate vastness of the *fan* qi, still separated from the world’s defilements.

Gazing up at the ninefold steps, we offer our single sincerity. Purple clouds billow over the crimson bridge, auspicious mists surge through the colorful banners. Embroidered robes lead the way, swiftly descending to the jasper altar; silver flames intertwine, as if the Dipper’s pole were arrayed in a forest of stars.

We, together with the altar officers, look afar toward the celestial steps, welcoming the stellar chariot.

Burn the Talisman to Receive the Celestial Descent—
Invoke the Descent of the Sages.

We, your humble servants, prostrate ourselves in profound reverence, and most respectfully invoke:

The Great Sage Father of the Dipper of the Central Heaven,
The Celestial Lord of the Dragon Han of the Northern Pole,
The Great Sage Mother of the Dipper of the Central Heaven,
The Heavenly Empress of Sacred Virtue and Golden Radiance,
The August Star Sovereign of Greedy Wolf of the North Dipper’s Net-Pole Palace,
The Supreme Emperor of the Numinous Pass Palace of the North Dipper,
The August Star Sovereign of Giant Gate,
The Star Sovereign of Store of Wealth of the North Dipper’s Purple Pole Palace,
The Star Sovereign of Literary Brilliance of the North Dipper’s Heavenly Motion Palace,
The Dipper Lord of the North Dipper’s Imperial Seat Palace,
The August Star Sovereign of Integrity and Chastity,
The Great Emperor of the North Dipper’s Supreme Palace,
The August Star Sovereign of Military Brilliance,
The Supreme Emperor of the North Dipper’s Pass-Convergence Palace,
The August Star Sovereign of Destruction,
The Great Emperor of the Cavern Yang Palace,
The August Star Sovereign of the Heavenly Honored Outer Assistant,
The Perfected of the Hidden Origin Palace,
The August Star Sovereign of the Inner Assistant,
The Nine August Life-Prolonging Ladies of the Great Sage North Dipper of the Central Heaven.

We, your humble servants, prostrate ourselves in gratitude, and reverently gaze toward the stellar compassion, beseeching the descent of the Jade Radiance upon the orchid dais.

The cloud chariot, having received our invocation, has graciously descended. We now prepare floating tea as our humble offering.

Presenting the Tea—

We, your humble servants, together in sincerity, most respectfully address:

The Wondrous Dao of the Void Emperor of the Ten Poles,
The High Perfected of the Northern Pole,
The Celestial Lord of the Dragon Han of the *fan* qi,
The Heavenly Empress of Sacred Virtue and Golden Radiance,
The Great Dao Lords of the Nine Dipper Sovereigns,
The True Governors of the Dipper Palaces,
The Star Lords of our Original Destiny,
The Master Lords of the Fire Bureau,
The Heavenly Marshals of Thunder,
The Deities invoked at the Lamp Altar—
we reverently gaze toward your sagely compassion, beseeching your luminous regard.

We have heard that the dust of the world is as minute as a grain of sand, yet the subtle transformations of the Dao operate without bound. The Dipper governs the tally of yin in the human realm, truly manifesting unfathomable merit. From ancient times to the present, most numinous and most sagely, since the Supreme Ultimate first divided heaven and earth, the jade pivot has already arrayed itself at the Northern Asterism. The nine-petaled lotus blossoms forth at once, and the seven regulators of the Jade Balance give rise to the myriad kinds. Thus, though the nobility and baseness of human stations may differ, the illumination of destiny’s allotment remains unchanged. Whether called misfortune or fortune, calamity or blessing, all arise from the same origin, governed by the same sovereign. Yet their great compassion and great vows ever respond to devotion with descending mercy. By virtue of their profound power and profound grace, they repeatedly answer prayers in an instant. We now humbly lay bare our hearts, and as the sword-talismans align, the sagely chariot descends. The lamp flames blaze, and the divine radiance descends; the numinous conclave is complete. The dark effigy is arrayed in splendor, and the bright water and fragrant wine are presented as the first offering.

Ritual Proceedings—

We, your humble servants, together in sincerity, most respectfully address:

The Wondrous Dao of the Void Emperor of the Ten Poles,
The High Perfected,
The Celestial Lord of the Dragon Han of the *fan* qi,
The Heavenly Empress of Sacred Virtue and Golden Radiance,
The Great Dao Lords of the Nine Dipper Sovereigns,
The Boundless True Governors of the Dipper Palaces,
The Star Lords of our Original Destiny,
The Master Lords of the Fire Bureau,
The Marshal Generals of the Three Realms,
and all the mighty numina—
we reverently gaze toward your sagely compassion, beseeching your luminous regard.

We have heard that in responding to the Nine Heavens and the Nine Earths, none are more revered than the Nine Sovereigns. Whether called the Northern Pole or the Northern Asterism, none are more illustrious than the North Dipper. Resplendent above, they traverse the heavens. Thus, all who possess ears and eyes cannot fail to see and hear.

And all who possess life and destiny are equally endowed by this bestowal.
Their merit pervades the myriad transformations; their Dao/Way unites the Three Powers.
Vast as the numina of seas and mountains, they are revered; their subtle blessings, like the nurturing moisture of rain, are universally received.
Even the fish and eels of rivers and streams turn their hearts in morning devotion—
how could any calamity not be dispelled, any blessing not be attained?
Yet what is felt must be communicated, what is sought must be answered; thus we present our earnest offering.

With pure sincerity, we, your humble servants, reverently address:
The Perfected of the Wondrous Dao/Way of the Supreme Void,
The Celestial Lord of the Dragon Han of the *fan* qi,
The Heavenly Empress of Sacred Virtue and Golden Radiance,
The Great Dao Lords of the Nine Dipper Sovereigns,
The Boundless True Governors of the Dipper Palaces,
The Star Lords of our Original Destiny,
The Master Lords of the Fire Bureau,
The Thunder Gods and Celestial Marshals,
and all the mighty numina of the Three Realms—
we reverently gaze toward your sagely compassion, beseeching your luminous regard.

We have heard that they serve as the pivot and master,
governing the six qi and directing the four seasons,
ordering the principles of governance, unifying Heaven and Earth,
encompassing the five phases and presiding over the eight trigrams.
Their radiance descends upon the earthly realm; their station crowns the center of Heaven.

In the beginning, before the Great Simplicity, there was neither form nor image.
Yet since the formation of the Primal Yellow, transformation has followed its warp and weft.
The August Person took brush in hand to inscribe talismans; the Supreme One opened the scrolls to expound their mysteries.
Seated upon the jade register, they taught the golden precepts.
Treading the luminous path of their teachers, they revealed the subtleties of the ancestral texts.
Their commands soar as spirits; their audience with the Emperor is swift.
Thus the numinous writ of the Fire Bureau is made manifest.

We humbly recall that these teachings have been transmitted through generations,
and we, your humble servants, are permitted to offer our earnest pleas.
Our sunflower-and-bean sincerity may move you, though our meager offerings of stagnant waters and humble libations are unworthy.
Yet we present this clear water and fragrant wine as our final offering.

The ritual proceeds; memorials or petitions are presented.
We have heard that the Dao/Way is without intent yet may be sought through devotion;
the Supreme One revealed the canon of life extension.
Heaven does not speak yet responds with perfect efficacy;
the Dipper Perfected bequeathed the statutes for averting misfortune.
The stellar chariots descend, their rosy hems gathered in assembly.
The rites of the three offerings now complete, how dare we falter in wholehearted devotion?

We recall that in high antiquity, knotted cords sufficed without written words.
Then came the August Person, who took brush in hand to expound the luminous scriptures.
Thus, sealed petitions may convey our grateful pleas,
and brush and paper may fully express our earnest intent.
The imperial hearing is near; the sagely regard is not distant.
Nine prostrations raise our gaze toward the celestial countenance;
thrice we purify our hands to unfold the cloud-bound scriptures.
The golden chariots and jade carriages have already descended to the mortal dust.
The jade missives and golden writs shall soon bestow their gracious decrees in response.

We now command the divine officers of the ritual altar to swiftly bear our petition aloft.
Thus, we present:
The memorial text and the petition of the heart.

We shall kneel to make our reverent address.
The proclamation of the talismanic writ is complete.

The master paces the ritual steps, prostrates upon the earth, and awaits the divine response. Upon receiving it, he rises to offer incense.

Who dissolves the calamities of curses and oaths.
Great Sage of the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper,
Who dissolves the calamities of Heaven’s Net.
Great Sage of the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper,

Thus, the Seven Primes,
Great Sages of wondrous spiritual efficacy,
Deliver and ferry across all calamities and hardships,
Lifting sentient beings from suffering.
Should there be those who urgently invoke,
Recitation ensures peace and safety.
All rely upon the generation of a hundred blessings,
All harmonize with the Five Phases.
The Three Hun souls attain peace and health,
And malevolent spirits cannot linger.
True qi descends from the Five Directions,
And myriad blessings naturally converge.
Longevity transcends the Eight Difficulties,
All through reverence for the Seven Stars.
Life after life, the body remains at ease,
And generation after generation, the spirit stays pure.
Goodness mirrors the reflection in light,
Response echoes the sound within the valley.
The Three Primes’ spirits jointly guard,
The myriad sages’ eyes share clarity.
Without disaster, without obstruction,
Forever preserving the tranquility of the Dao-heart.

**Transformation, Medical Treatment, Divination**
We, your humble servants, so-and-so and others, with utmost sincerity, reverently address the Supreme Void’s Wondrous Dao, the Ten August Perfected, the Brahma-qi Dragon Han Heavenly Lords, the Purple Radiance Golden Perfected Sagely Virtue Heavenly Empress, the Northern Dipper’s Nine August Dao Lords, the ranked true sovereigns of the Dipper Palace, the Star Lords of our original destiny, the Fire Mansion Master Lords, the Heavenly Thunder Masters, and all the exalted perfected invoked at the lamp altar. We gaze reverently toward your auspicious radiance, praying that your luminous regard may illumine us.

We have heard that repentance and reverence dare not transgress the scriptural teachings, and that earnest petitions may perhaps move the celestial heart. The rivers and seas are vast and deep, heaven and earth broad and great—there is nothing they do not encompass, nothing they do not embrace. Thus, there is that which is received, and that which is contained.

We humbly reflect that we, your servants, are but fleeting and insignificant lives, adrift in the midst of the world. Though we have roughly studied the Dao, we remain ashamed to follow the current. In observing the precepts, our conduct has been lacking; in cultivating ourselves, we have not been upright. The seven emotions and six desires still entangle us, and the three karmic actions and six senses remain impure. Thereby, though we have received the dharma, we have only invited further transgressions. We have concealed truth and feigned falsity, discoursed on emptiness and expounded on existence, leaked the secret purport of the mysterious precepts, and increased the sins recorded in the Black Book. Our actions accumulate many faults, and we dwell without a single good deed. At times, we tread the steps of the flying Dipper’s pace yet err in the sequence of left and right; or we focus our thoughts and direct our contemplation yet confuse what is heard and seen in their order. The offerings of incense and fire have not been without negligence, and the writing of talismans and registers has indeed been flawed.

Though these transgressions may be unknown to others in the brightness of day, in the hidden darkness the gods are surely enraged. Now that we have revealed them and sought forgiveness, may we, your servants, be permitted to inscribe our names in the registers of the Upper Clarity’s capital, that our forms and spirits may ascend to the tranquil void and together pursue the wondrous journey. May our aspirations be truly pure, and may we forever serve the transformation of the Void and Non-being.

We first pray for celestial auspiciousness and earthly prosperity, for a sagely ruler and worthy ministers, for the sun and moon’s steadfast brightness, and for timely rain and sunshine. May the four seas be free of the omens of war, and may the people sing of years of abundance and joy.

Next, we pray for the ritual master, so-and-so, that his fortune may align with the Great Harmony, that his destiny may surpass predetermination, and that no demonic forces may assail him. May the resources of his official salary and celestial horses support him, and may his body be endowed with luminous blessings. May his spirit be clarified and rectified, and may his entire household—young and old—enjoy peace and health in all four seasons.

May your servants’ seven generations of ancestors swiftly attain the realm of carefree wandering. May the lingering souls in the Three Wretched Realms all ascend to the land of bliss. May all sentient beings partake of your vast grace.

Now, as the incense wanes and the precious talismans near their end, the water clock hastens its flow. The remaining light still shines afar upon the thatched hut, while the clear imperial progress has already preceded the imperial carriage. The ranks of mandarin ducks and egrets are heard in the jingling of their pendants; the phoenix’s call and the luan’s song are glimpsed in the order of their caps and robes. The rainbow banners and feathered canopies now rest in the celestial palace, while the tiger guards and dragon stewards return to the golden gates. The crimson mists and scarlet clouds billow, and the jade towers and gem chambers stand in lofty cold. We have fulfilled our initial intent, yet the end remains beyond reach. Our earnest devotion, swift in coming and fleeting in going, only deepens our lingering attachment.

We, your servants, along with the ritual master, gaze afar toward the celestial steps and take leave of the immortal’s chariot.

The rite of supplication and exorcism for the Great Unity Fire Mansion is now complete.
