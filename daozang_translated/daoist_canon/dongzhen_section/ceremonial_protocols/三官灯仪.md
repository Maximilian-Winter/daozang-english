**The Ritual of the Three Officials’ Lamps**
*Proceedings Conducted According to Rite*

We have heard that the wondrous Dao of the Mysterious Origin, through the movement of primordial *qi*, inaugurated Heaven and Earth. Clear and turbid were sundered, and the Three Powers were perfected, manifesting as sun and moon. Obscurity and brightness divide day and night; cold and heat spread across the four seasons. Humankind, born of harmonious *qi*, is the most numinous of all beings; our nature, fundamentally pure and void, receives its endowment from the Five Phases. Rank and station distinguish noble from base, while karmic consequences apportion reward and retribution. Thus do the Three Officials examine and judge, dispensing merit and fault with impartiality; the Five Emperors record transgressions, inscribing wrongdoing where it lies.

Now, as mortals dwell in the lower realm, our lives are bound to the heavens above. The revolutions of stars and constellations bring auspicious or baleful influences; the cycles of fate shift, encountering clashes or convergences. Some err in conduct, violating the Five Constants; others suffer calamities under the Three Disasters. Killing without restraint, indulging greed, harming others for selfish gain—such deeds are far from virtuous. Curses and maledictions may offend the foundations of Heaven; construction and labor may trespass upon the domains of Earth. As for the six senses and three karmic actions, myriad transgressions arise—without the power of the Dao, none can be purged.

Today, on this auspicious dawn, we celebrate the arrival of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Primes, the very season when the Three Officials conduct their audit, a time when the Nine Heavens bestow blessings. Therefore, we purify body and mind, present offerings with utmost reverence, and illuminate the celestial vaults with radiant lamps. Silver candles gleam across the starry expanse; myriad red lotuses bloom in the triple-five conjunction. Three libations of fine wine are poured, offerings made to the myriad sages. The fragrance of aloeswood and sandalwood ascends to the Golden Gates of Heaven; the chanting of immortal hymns swiftly reaches the Jade Clarity of the Yuqing realm. With sincere devotion, we humbly invoke great blessings. The assembly, in pious reverence, extols the merit of the Dao.

We sincerely prostrate and take refuge in the Most High Heavenly Worthy of the Great Luo, the Eternal Preserver of Life and Guardian of the Body.

We, the assembled, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in the Upper Prime’s First-Rank Nine-*Qi* Bestower of Blessings, the Heavenly Official of Purple Tenuity, the Great Emperor, and all the divine immortals and spirit-officials.

We have heard that the Great Sage of Spontaneous Nature descends with the authority of the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Ultimate; the Sovereign of the Highest Perfected governs the Seven Treasures’ Purple Tenuity Palace. At the assemblies of promotion and advancement, the phoenix chariot descends; on the occasions of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Primes, the cloud carriage returns. Recording the deeds of gods and humans, marking merit and fault, blessings are bestowed at the Triple Yang, and radiance flows with the Nine *Qi*.

Today, we fix our thoughts upon the exalted, pour libations with reverence, and erect images in the Mysterious Capital, arranging the rites within the purified precinct. With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the Upper Prime’s First-Rank Nine-*Qi* Bestower of Blessings, the Heavenly Lord of Purple Tenuity.

May your luminous scrutiny and merciful gaze bestow pure blessings. In the Northern Capital’s dark registers, may our names be eternally inscribed; in the Southern Prosperity’s upper palace, may the characters of long life be recorded. May the Dao be perfected in every life, and the mind remain pure through all generations. We bow our heads in reverence, chanting with sincere devotion.

We take refuge in the Most High Heavenly Official of the Nine-*Qi* Bestower of Blessings in the Purple Tenuity Palace.

True Capital of Primordial Yang, Lord of the Purple Tenuity Palace.
Great Sage of Spontaneous Nature, Heavenly Official Bestower of Blessings.
Ruler of the Celestial Realm, commander of gods and spirits.
Striking bells and drums, riding clouds in chariots.
Processions of a thousand myriad, commanding the celestial hosts.
Purging inauspicious filth, cleansing turbidity to clarity.
By the Emperor’s decree, universally aiding all living beings.
Dispelling evil, aiding the upright, preserving Heaven’s eternal existence.

We, the assembled, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in the Middle Prime’s Second-Rank Seven-*Qi* Pardoner of Sins, the Earthly Official of Pure Emptiness, the Great Emperor, and all the divine immortals and spirit-officials.

We have heard that in the Palace of the Great Yang, one gazes upon the purity and emptiness of the Great Dao; within the Cavern of Darkness, one beholds the radiant splendor of the Primordial Lord. The kinds of the Five Peaks and Eight Boundaries gather to audit the registers of life; the streams of the Nine Darks and Three Bureaus seek clemency and pardon for sins. How much more do we, dwellers of the lower realm, rely upon this primal grace!

Today, we cleanse the dust from our hearts, reverently following the sagely model. Gazing upon the numinous, we erect images; establishing purified precincts, we arrange the rites. With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the Middle Prime’s Second-Rank Pardoner of Sins, the Earthly Official of Pure Emptiness, the Great Emperor.

May your radiant light shine forth, your gaze attend our earnest pleas. May faults and errors in all beings be erased, their lives and growth flourish; may goodness and benefit extend to all creatures, winged and finned, bringing them peace and tranquility. In boundless benevolence, all things receive your protection. We bow our heads in reverence, chanting with sincere devotion.

We take refuge in the Most High Earthly Official of the Seven-*Qi* Pardoner of Sins in the Cavern of Emptiness.

Second Brother Pardoner of Sins, Lord Emperor and Primordial Lord.
Numinous Perfected Great Sage, spirit of the altars of soil and grain.
Nurturing the myriad things, fostering the people below.
Dispelling demons and monsters, sweeping away pernicious influences.
Riding clouds and tigers, traversing Heaven and Earth.
Safeguarding the nation and home, bringing peace within and without.
Eliminating the Nine Calamities, extirpating the Five Pestilences.
Bestowing auspicious blessings, uniting with the Dao in truth.

We, the assembled, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in the Five-*Qi* Reliever of Calamities, the Water Official and Divine King of Yang Valley, and all the divine immortals and spirit-officials.

We have heard that the Golden Numen shines resplendent, the Water Official governs the Palace of Yang Valley; the precious calendar divides authority, the Great Emperor presides over the Dao of the Cavern of Darkness. Determining the ranks of rivers and streams, examining the numinous power of seas and oceans. Gathering the Five *Qi* at the establishment of life, no darkness remains unilluminated; following the multitudes in relieving calamities, all wishes are fulfilled.

Today, we, fortunate to revere the True from our earliest years, serve the teachings without birth. Gazing upon the image of Fusang, we establish purified precincts and arrange the rites. With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the Lower Prime’s Third-Rank Reliever of Calamities, the Water Official and Divine King of Yang Valley.

May your swift chariot descend in response, our reverent sincerity ascend to you. O Great Sage of Long Life, may you extend life across the seas and lands; O Venerable Spirit of Calamity’s Release, may you dissolve the perils of the living and the dead. May blessings arrive, and misfortunes vanish in silence. We bow our heads in reverence, chanting with sincere devotion.

We take refuge in the Most High Water Official of the Five-*Qi* Reliever of Calamities in the Cavern of Origins.

At the Lower Prime’s Release of Calamities, within the Golden Gates of the Grotto’s Shade,
The Great Emperor, Water Lord, Spirit of the Pure and Cold,
Rides clouds and commands *qi*, hunting down demonic essences.
Driving thunder and chasing lightning, seas calm and rivers clear.
Pacifying waves and subduing surges, winds and clouds obey his call.

Should any petty demon dare harass the living,
May its body be severed ten thousandfold, its form forever banished.
Foul impurities dissolve and vanish; the Dao’s *qi* endures eternally.

Reciting scriptures, proclaiming petitions, and dedicating merit—
The Rite of the Three Officials’ Lamps is now complete.
