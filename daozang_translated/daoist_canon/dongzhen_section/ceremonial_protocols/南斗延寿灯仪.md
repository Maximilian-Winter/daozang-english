The Rite of the Southern Dipper Lamp for Prolonging Life proceeds according to the prescribed form.

[Officiant’s name], with reverent awe and trepidation, bows deeply, prostrates, burns incense, and bows again, respectfully memorializing:

The Three Clarities and August Sages,
The Ten Poles and Lofty Perfected,
The Purple Tenuity Great Emperor, Lord of the Central Heavenly Stars,
The Imperial Lord of the Sun Palace of Great Yang,
The August Sovereign of the Moon Mansion of Great Yin,
The Star Lords of the Five Planets and Four Luminaries,
The Six Bureau Star Lords of the Southern Dipper for Prolonging Life,
The Nine August Star Lords of the Northern Dipper for Bestowing Birth,
The Star Lords of the Eastern, Western, and Central Dippers,
The Star Lords of the Twenty-Eight Constellations,
The Host of Perfected of All Heavenly Degrees,
The Star Lord of One’s Original Destiny,
The Three Primordials and Three Officials, Great Emperors,
The Four Sagely Lords of the Northern Culmen,
The Five Masters and Three Ministries, Perfected Lords,
The Four Bureaus of the Three Realms,
And the Boundless Assembly of Sages.

At the assembly of the Lamp Altar, the myriad sages and thousand perfected gather.
May the sagely compassion turn and illumine with radiant clarity.

I have heard that of the powers of Heaven and Earth, none is greater than life; of the categories of the *Hong Fan*, none is more complete than fortune. Thus there exists the office of governance, through which one may extend the heart’s prayers for exorcism and blessing.

Looking up to the Three Realms, the Southern Dipper is the palace of longevity; within the Six Bureaus, the Perfected Lords hold the authority of governance. All those with transient forms submit to their rule. Therefore, in accordance with the ranks of the *River Chart* and the rituals of the *Lingbao* scriptures, we solemnly arrange the star lamps and reverently present the offerings of the jiao rites, that we may communicate with the Upper Realm and summon the descent of the lofty perfected.

Now, your disciple [Name] humbly transmits his sincerity through the fragrant incense, trusting in the manifestation of all things. Gazing up to the Southern Culmen, he models himself upon the Dipper’s governance. Thus the radiance of the precious torches shines forth to reveal the divine likeness; chanting the true scriptures and intoning the hymns, may we be deemed worthy of their advent.

We pray that Heaven’s scrutiny will not reject us, and that the divine heart will respond with kindness. With jade chariots and feathered canopies, your majestic presence is near; with golden steeds and jade carriages, your numinous array fills the void. May the extension of life and the fixing of destiny bring the advent of auspicious qi; may the illumination of the obscure and the scrutiny of the subtle manifest the power of your illuminating presence.

Humbly offering the tokens of the Dharma, we exalt the divine luminaries. Bowing our heads in reverence, we take refuge and devoutly praise. We, your assembled servants, with sincere hearts take refuge in the Great Sage of the Palace of Illustrious Virtue, the Lord of Destiny and Prime Minister of the Southern Dipper’s Celestial Bureau, the Perfected Lord Who Mirrors the State, and all the numinous officials.

I have heard that Heaven endows all living beings with their natural destinies, and that all who embrace the great root return to the midst of the August Culmen. Those who nurture it find fortune ever-increasing; those who corrupt it see calamity arise of itself. The power of governance and control truly resides in the office that oversees all. If there are prayers or exorcisms to be made, one must cultivate utmost sincerity.

This day, I, [Name], purify my heart and cleanse my thoughts, nurture my qi and preserve my spirit. Long have I cherished a heart that yearns for the Dao, revering the celestial images above. In strict accordance with ritual protocol, I establish the stellar altar, preparing the rites of incense, flowers, lamps, and candles. I take refuge in the Great Sage of the Palace of Illustrious Virtue, the Lord of Destiny and Prime Minister of the Southern Dipper’s Celestial Bureau, the Perfected Lord Who Mirrors the State.

May Heaven guide their hearts, that all may follow the enduring Dao; may all things receive their blessings, that none suffer the misfortune of premature demise. Bowing my head in reverence, I take refuge and chant in accordance with the rites:

*Southern Dipper, Lord of Destiny, exalted Perfected of the Highest Rank,*
*Encompassing the myriad phenomena, mighty and numinous Guardian of the State.*
*Celestial Bureau of Heaven, minister to the Emperor on left and right.*
*The host of immortals receive their commands, the ten thousand qi arise and flourish.*
*Prime Minister of the Golden Portal, august deity of the Jade Purity.*
*Mysterious and wondrous Dao, dare there be any who disobey?*
*May all spirits remain in tranquil vigil, safeguarding the imperial court.*

We, your assembled servants, with sincere hearts take refuge in the Great Sage of the Palace of Cavernous Script, the Celestial Minister of the Southern Dipper Who Records Destiny, the Perfected Lord Who Mirrors the Sacred Peaks, and all the numinous officials.

I have heard: In the beginning of the Supreme Ultimate, the Dao had no fixed form. After my birth, all things acquired their proper names. Fortune and misfortune lie in virtue, where noble and base are not mistaken; good and ill depend on the person, where worthy and foolish are not confused. Regarding those who preside over these matters, they are entrusted with the natural order. If one offers sincere devotion, one shall surely receive abundant recompense.

This day, I, [Name], focus my heart and rectify my intentions, turning toward the Dao to cultivate perfection. Gazing upward, I contemplate the luminous celestial images, devoutly relying on the aid and favor of High Heaven. In strict accordance with ritual protocol, I establish the stellar altar, preparing the rites of incense, flowers, lamps, and candles. I take refuge in the Great Sage of the Palace of Cavernous Script, the Celestial Minister of the Southern Dipper Who Records Destiny, the Perfected Lord Who Mirrors the Sacred Peaks.

May the supreme Dao be magnified, its awe-inspiring power silently gathering and overseeing all; may all living beings be universally saved, their virtuous deeds duly ordered and perfected. Bowing my head in reverence, I devoutly chant:

*Southern Dipper, Recorder of Destiny, august Celestial Minister.*
*Determining life, bestowing emoluments, preserving fate, and prolonging life.*
*Peak deities receive their mandate, overseeing the host of spirits.*
*Resplendent and wondrous Dao, dispelling demonic vapors.*
*Cleansing away evil obstructions, safeguarding the body’s form.*
*The host of immortals look up in reverence, all mysteries made manifest.*
*By the natural workings of creation, ascend to the Supreme Purity.*

We, your assembled servants, with sincere hearts take refuge in the Great Sage of the Palace of Gentle Virtue, the Celestial Beam of the Southern Dipper Who Prolongs Life and Preserves Destiny, the Perfected Lord, and all the numinous officials.

I have heard: Long life and enduring vision are the constant essence of the great Dao; prayers for longevity and prolonged life are the desires of all people. In Heaven, it remains eternally unchanging; in humanity, it ensures destiny is distant and unharmed. To prolong life, nothing precedes prayer; to invoke the blessings of the numinous office, one must cultivate sincerity toward all things.

This day, I, [Name], direct my intentions with clarity, gazing upward to observe the celestial images. May the perfected and divine descend to witness my devotion, and may my longevity be increased and exalted. In strict accordance with ritual protocol, I establish the stellar altar, preparing the rites of incense, flowers, lamps, and candles. I take refuge in the Great Sage of the Palace of Gentle Virtue, the Celestial Beam of the Southern Dipper Who Prolongs Life and Preserves Destiny.

May boundless benevolence be bestowed, that all may follow the blessings of enduring life; may the power of life be spread and expanded, that there be no fear of premature demise.

With bowed head, I take refuge and devoutly intone in praise:
The Southern Dipper Prolongs Life, as the Celestial Beam.
Universally delivering all beings, may they all flourish and prosper.
Longevity and felicity, boundless as the ages.
Eternally preserving Heaven’s mandate, dispelling all misfortune.
Life unceasing, steadfast as hills and ridges.
Benevolence universally bestowed, the glory of the Winnowing Basket and Wings renewed.
In virtue united with the divine, enduring through ancient ages.

We, your servants, with single-minded devotion take refuge in the Great Sage of the Palace of Preserved Brilliance, the Southern Dipper Celestial Peer Who Increases Lifespan and Preserves Life, and all spirit officials.

I have heard: when numbers are divided, their abundance or scarcity becomes manifest—abundance is deemed excellence. When destiny descends, its length or brevity is distinguished—longevity is its auspicious sign. Only with an un-deceiving heart may the years be extended, for the perfected transcendents govern this, and pure intention is what they seek.

Today, I, [Name], seek to augment my years of venerable age, reverently gazing upon the radiant celestial images. In the realm of the indistinct, response comes through form and sound. Strictly adhering to ritual protocol, I establish the stellar altar, preparing the rites of incense, flowers, lamps, and candles. I take refuge in the Great Sage of the Palace of Preserved Brilliance, the Southern Dipper Celestial Peer Who Increases Lifespan and Preserves Life.

May boundless compassion descend, ever-growing like the spring sun; may distant years greatly increase, as steadfast as Mount Song’s foundation.

With bowed head, I take refuge and devoutly intone in praise:
The Southern Dipper Increases Lifespan, peer to Heaven.
Lofty, luminous, and enduring, its power of life knows no end.
Preserving this primordial mandate, that it never lose its center.
Longevity and tranquility, forever in accord with the true wind.
The supreme number flows and spreads, blessings and prosperity ascend.
For a hundred million years, may it guard my person.
The pure upper realms, where cloud-dragon chariots ascend.

We, your servants, with single-minded devotion take refuge in the Great Sage of the Palace of Celestial Nodes, the Southern Dipper Celestial Pivot Who Delivers from Calamity and Refines the Soul of Wenchang, and all spirit officials.

I have heard: the two qi subtly shift, bearing the principle of flourishing and decline; the Five Phases alternate in motion, yet never lack the mechanism of ebb and flow. Considering the toils of mortal life, how could there be no encounters with calamity? Since the true sages govern deliverance, the common people should devote themselves wholeheartedly.

Today, I, [Name], in awe and trepidation, rectify my conduct, reverently gazing upon the celestial image with faith and devotion. I vow to take refuge in the Great Dao and seek deliverance through divine grace. Strictly adhering to ritual protocol, I establish the altar, preparing the rites of incense, flowers, lamps, and candles. I take refuge in the Great Sage of the Palace of Celestial Nodes, the Southern Dipper Celestial Pivot Who Delivers from Calamity and Refines the Soul of Wenchang.

May you ever excel in saving humanity, silently dissolving disasters and misfortunes; ever cherishing the salvation of the world, manifesting subtle warnings of auspicious omens.

With bowed head, I take refuge and devoutly intone in praise:
The Southern Dipper Delivers from Calamity, as Heaven’s Pivot.
In stillness, it governs transformation, all things flourish and wither.
Wenchang shines resplendent, repository of charts and books.
Turning misfortune into fortune, crafting my cinnabar chariot.
Refining the po and guarding the shen, protecting the hun and preserving the body.
Heaven’s light settled in peace, calamities swept away.
The Dao’s qi endures, dwelling with the sacred and true.

We, your servants, with single-minded devotion take refuge in the Great Sage of the Palace of Great Sanctity, the Southern Dipper Celestial Mechanism Who Oversees Life and the Great Judge, and all spirit officials.

I have heard: true immortals enact virtue, ashamed to be ignorant of even a single thing; the sagely Dao responds to the times, serving as the wondrous function of all hearts. Bestowing the center and establishing destiny, receiving qi and endowing form, they oversee the work of generation and completion—how dare I not approach with reverence and offer my prayers?

Today, I, [Name], purify my heart and turn toward the Dao, with focused intention gazing upon Heaven. Reflecting upon the grace of nurturing and growth, I venture to perform the rites of prayer and exorcism. Strictly adhering to ritual protocol, I establish the stellar altar, preparing the rites of incense, flowers, lamps, and candles. With single-minded devotion, I take refuge in the Great Sage of the Palace of Great Sanctity, the Southern Dipper Celestial Mechanism Who Oversees Life and the Great Judge.

May you embody the generative power of Heaven and Earth to govern transformation; may the harmony of nature and destiny all return to the Dao.

With bowed head, I take refuge and devoutly intone in praise:
The Southern Dipper Oversees Life, as Heaven’s Beam.
Directing the workings of creation, moving in and out in timely response.
Charged with the registers of destiny, even spirits dare not pry.
The vastness of the Great Void, the office of the Great Judge.
From root to origin, compliant and without deficiency.
Through ten thousand kalpas enduring, ever-watchful and unchanging.
The universal overseer of destiny, ascending to the Supreme Subtlety.
The Rites of the Southern Dipper Longevity Lamp are now complete.
