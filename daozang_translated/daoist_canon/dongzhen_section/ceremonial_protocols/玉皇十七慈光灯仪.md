**Jade Emperor’s Seventeen Compassionate Radiance Lamp Rite**

**Entering the Altar – Purification of Heaven and Earth Incantation**
The Lord of the Golden Portal, Mysterious Vault,
The Most High, Revered Jade Emperor.
His wondrous countenance crowns all heavens,
His compassionate radiance illumines the Three Realms.
True Sage, Master of the Wondrous Dao,
On whom gods and humans rely.
The Great Vehicle bestows its teachings,
The True One guides the lost.
His merit vast as empty space,
His praise without end.

We humbly kindle seventeen lamps,
Their flickering glow unfolds flowers of glad tidings;
Their light pierces the ninefold heavens,
As if glimpsing the Hall of Luminous Clarity.
First offering a single incense stick,
To ascend and reach the celestial realms.

We, your servants, [Name] and [Name], along with all assembled Daoists,
With reverence and awe, bow our heads in prostration,
Gazing afar toward the heavenly steps,
A hundred bows to reverently invoke:
The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Great Dao of Qingwei,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Its Power, Most High Lord of the Dao,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Divine Treasure, Great Scarlet Spirit Treasure,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Virtue,
The Jade Emperor, Sacred Lord of the Seventeen Compassionate Radiance and Vast Heaven,
The Heavenly Worthy, Sacred Father of the King of Mysterious Strictness and Wondrous Joy,
The Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother of the Radiant Moon Empress,
The Great Sagely Empress Dowager of the Palace of Wondrous Virtue in the Grand Tenuity,
The Great Heavenly Emperor of the Wondrous Spirit and Non-Action of the Yu Yu Heaven,
The Heavenly Emperor of the High Void and Pure Clarity,
The Jade Void Highest Emperor,
The August Heavenly Emperor,
The Five Elder Highest Emperors,
The Great Sage and Wondrous Perfected of Heavenly Truth,
The Divine Consorts and Jade Maidens,
The Perfected of Compassion and Deliverance from Distress,
The Perfected of Instant Response and Salvation from Suffering,
The Perfected of Deliverance from Life and Death,
The Perfected of Myriad Blessings and Protective Presence.

As the scripture’s teachings commence,
All Perfected, the Three Realms, the Four Palaces, the Six Directions, and the Myriad Spirits,
We reverently await the phoenix’s song and the luan’s call,
Descending from the ninefold gates of heaven;
The dragon’s play and the qilin’s dance,
Alighting upon the Five Turbidities of the human realm.
Pour forth your radiant flames,
And deign to receive our humble sincerest devotion.
With this offering, may resonance be achieved.
Overwhelmed with gratitude, we, the assembled officials, bow again.

**Cloud Chariot – Offering Incense – Presenting Tea – Conveying Intent**
We have heard:
Before the jade embryo was divided,
The profound Dao-qi already contained the vast;
As the jade countenance gradually took form,
The brilliance of compassionate radiance shone resplendent.
Above, it illumines the Nine Heavens,
Establishing the realm of light and purity;
Below, it shines upon the Nine Earths,
Causing the heavy and turbid to take shape.
The Three Luminaries thereby emit their splendor,
All things rely upon it for transformation and nurturance.
Those bathed in its illumination,
All living beings attain fulfillment;
Those graced by its brilliance,
No darkness remains unopened.
Though forms are confined between heaven and earth,
All are enveloped in its singular radiance.

We, your servants, presumptuously present this humble offering,
Daring to praise the Jade Emperor’s radiance.
Measuring the sea with a gourd, we are deeply ashamed;
Offering our sincerity like an otter’s sacrifice, our merit is slight.
On this auspicious day,
We kindle and light the lamps,
Humbly beseeching your non-interfering benevolence,
To perceive our selfless prayers.

We, the Daoists [Name] and others,
Born into the realm of humanity,
Turn our hearts toward the Dao,
Moved by the Emperor’s radiance to seek refuge,
And inspired by his merit to cultivate ourselves.
Relying on praise and exaltation,
We offer a small token of reverence.
Now, as the scripture recitation concludes
And the ritual nears completion,
We bare our sincere hearts,
Gazing afar toward the vermilion steps.
The seventeen lamps of compassionate radiance,
Each is praised in song;
We gaze upon the countless ranks of attendants,
Their distant arrival fills us with awe.

We pray that our humble sincerity may ascend,
And the heavenly radiance descend to illumine.
May its splendor grace our humble abodes,
Opening auspicious light of fulfillment;
May its brilliance shine upon the clouded thoroughfares,
Bestowing extraordinary blessings.
With every prayer, may there be response;
No wish left unfulfilled.
All return to the perfection within,
Universally entering the realm of radiance.
Following the lamps, we recite virtuous vows,
With reverent and sincere devotion.

We bow our heads and take refuge
In the Boundless Great Dao.
We sincerely worship the Most High Great Luo Heaven,
The Jade Emperor of the Seventeen Compassionate Radiance, Heavenly Worthy.

We, your servants, with devoted hearts take refuge,
In the Great Heavenly Worthy of Divine Transformative Radiance, the Jade Emperor,
The Heavenly Worthy, Sacred Father,
The Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother,
And all the Perfected and Divine Officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard:
The Most August of the Golden Portal,
Ever holds a merciful heart;
The Jade Emperor,
Manifests his radiance through compassion.
Those who receive its illumination,
All rely upon his pity and grace;
Those who are nurtured by its influence,
All emerge beneath his sheltering canopy.
His loyalty and forgiveness are without flaw,
His magnanimity and tolerance boundless.
To express our private devotion,
We must rely on the rites of praise and exaltation.

We sincerely worship the Most High Great Luo Heaven,
The Great Heavenly Worthy of Divine Transformative Radiance, the Jade Emperor.

Reverently considering the Jade Emperor,
Who emits his divine radiance,
Opening the Three Luminaries,
Universally illuminating the ten directions.
Manifesting in fragrant adornment,
His sagely virtue shines resplendent.
Without peer, without equal,
Beyond measure, beyond estimation.

Today, your disciples
Have established this orchid altar.
Kindling lamps and offering praise,
We ascend to reach the vault of heaven.
May you deign to look upon us,
Dispelling all inauspiciousness.
Extending life and delivering from distress,
Granting long enjoyment of peace and well-being.
With devoted hearts, we take refuge,
Praying for peace and well-being.

We, your servants, with devoted hearts take refuge,
In the Great Compassionate Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy,
The Heavenly Worthy, Sacred Father,
The Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother,
And all the divine immortals and officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We, the Dao-devoted, have long known gratitude yet found no means to repay our origins. Thus, we don the yellow crown, take refuge in the mysterious celestial patterns, and, in strict accordance with ritual law, reverently establish precious lamps to offer worship to the Great Compassionate Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the perfected spirits and true lords of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We humbly pray that the Emperor’s heart may broadly extend, that the heavenly Dao may favor reciprocity. May he release his compassion, that the light of vitality may brighten and revive the cosmos; may he dispel misfortune, that calamity may cease and auspiciousness arrive at our households. May the great turtle’s back stand firm, may the vast abode rest secure, our devoted hearts bowing in reverence as we join in praise.

We sincerely worship the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Compassionate Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.

Reverently considering the Jade Emperor: his light radiates compassion, ascending to connect with the celestial patterns, descending to encompass the earth’s bounds. His illumination reveals the hidden and the manifest, so that all, near and far, know to take refuge. He absolves transgressions and purges misfortune, sweeping away peril and danger. Today, we disciples reverently make our petition according to ritual, hoping for his gracious regard and the fulfillment of our prayers. May our bodies receive liberation, our hearts awaken to the subtle mysteries. May we dissolve worldly calamities and swiftly realize the effortless Way.

We, your servants, with devoted hearts take refuge in the Great Joyous Giving Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the divine immortals and officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard that his treasuries of wealth and treasure, in days past, were generously bestowed; in times of famine, infirmity, and hardship, he responded with timely aid. Such joyous giving was never forced, for virtue stored within the inner chamber naturally radiates outward. Those touched by his kindness are as countless as the sands of the river; those bathed in his beneficence are not merely the multitudes of grasses and trees. Praise cannot exhaust him, nor can refuge ever be complete.

We, the Dao-devoted, dwell within the form of the great turtle’s back, tracing the footsteps of his vast compassion. Now, relying on the fragrance of cultivation, we offer this small token of reverence. Strictly following ritual law, we reverently establish precious lamps to offer worship to the Great Joyous Giving Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the perfected spirits and true lords of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We humbly pray that the August Emperor may bestow his favor upon the people below. May he grant abundant foundations, ensuring eternal peace across the ten thousand directions; may he spread auspicious gatherings, bringing lasting harmony to the four seasons. May the nine domains rejoice, may the three agricultural seasons yield omens of prosperity. With devoted hearts, we take refuge and sincerely proclaim his praise.

We sincerely worship the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Joyous Giving Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.

Reverently considering the Jade Emperor: his blessings and benefits are boundless. His wealth enables joyous giving, his grace extends to all. His radiance illumines the three realms, his light shines upon all heavens. His vast bestowals fill the earth, his salvation revives the common people. Today, we disciples wholeheartedly offer our devotion, kindling lamps in prayer and praise to protect and prolong the nation. May the Dao’s qi flow forth, awakening us to the true mystery. May all receive liberation, may disasters and transgressions be swept away. With one heart, we take refuge, praying for longevity.

We, your servants, with devoted hearts take refuge in the Great Forbearance Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the divine immortals and officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard that the heavenly Dao does not contend, yet it is ever said that goodness prevails; the Emperor’s virtue broadly extends, nurturing life with harmony. His nature is rooted in gentle compassion, thus his light radiates forbearance. Stillness can restrain motion, softness can overcome hardness. His magnanimity allows for tolerance, and thus he remains unshamed. How profound his weightiness, how true his compassionate heart! If people can embody this, they align with heaven.

We, the Dao-devoted, endowed with lowly forms and dwelling in the central realm, have long been sheltered by his grace. Yet we still seek to repay his kindness. Strictly following ritual law, we reverently establish precious lamps to offer worship to the Great Forbearance Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the perfected spirits and true lords of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We humbly pray that the heavenly heart may not abandon us, ever embracing tolerance. May his generous spirit expand, broadening the foundations of fortune; may his compassionate heart deepen, elevating virtuous deeds ever higher. May his virtue renew daily, may his affairs align with his will. With reverence, we bow our heads and sincerely proclaim his praise.

We sincerely worship the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Forbearance Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.

Reverently considering the Jade Emperor: his forbearance radiates light, his compassion pervades the dusty world, his transformation reaches distant lands. He sets aside strength and employs softness, using gentleness to overcome hardness. How vast his magnanimity—beyond all measure!

Today, we disciples lift our gaze to the vault of heaven. Blessings flow from his grace, boundless fortune arrives. May from this auspicious day forward, misfortune be dispelled. May we forever take refuge beneath his compassionate shelter, eternally welcoming good fortune.

We, your servants, with devoted hearts take refuge in the Great Impartial Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the divine immortals and officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard that he weighs the three realms, his position exalted in the mysterious vault; he mirrors the ten directions, his light thus impartial. He reveals that the heavenly principle is fundamentally without distinction, guiding human hearts to be free of bias. Those who grasp his intent naturally abandon partiality toward high or low; those who penetrate his subtlety all enter the Way of great impartiality and perfect rectitude.

This day, we, [name], reflecting upon the virtue and grace received, find repayment ever beyond reach. Reverently following the ritual statutes, we establish precious lamps, making offerings to the Great Impartial Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the true numina and sovereign spirits of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We humbly pray that the celestial light may shine down, and the imperial decree be generously bestowed. May virtue spread to all living beings, each preserving the firmness of their life-root; may merit aid the world, all encountering the flourishing of the times. Gathered in the same assembly as wind and clouds, may all equally partake of rain and dew. With devoted hearts we take refuge, reverently extolling:

We sincerely venerate the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Impartial Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.

We revere the Jade Emperor, whose great impartial light is vast and boundless, resplendent and radiant. It encompasses heaven and earth, yet enters the finest detail. The mysterious vault bestows its grace, and the dharma-realm manifests auspiciousness. Today, your disciples, gazing afar toward the divine realm, pour forth sincerity and faith, earnestly beseeching the heavens. May you bestow blessings and favor, dispelling calamities and misfortunes. May the myriad spirits receive felicity, and may we forever preserve peace and well-being.

We, your servants, with devoted hearts take refuge in the Great Gentle Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the divine immortals and officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard: the Supreme Lord is uniquely exalted, how could he be solitary in his supremacy? The supreme Dao is unrivaled, yet only through gentleness can strength be overcome. From his pure and tranquil dharmakāya, he universally manifests the luminous form of gentle radiance. Those who grasp its subtlety attain perfect harmony and refined elegance; those who receive its illumination find their hearts filled with kindness and auspiciousness. Resplendent to this day, radiant since antiquity.

We, your disciples who follow the Dao, born under its shelter, now freely wander in accord with our nature. Reflecting upon the establishment of modest merit, we reverently repay great virtue. Diligently adhering to the ritual statutes, we honor and establish precious lamps, making offerings to the Great Gentle Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy; the Sacred Father, Heavenly Worthy; the Primordial Lady, Sacred Mother; and all the true numina and sovereign spirits of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We humbly pray that the celestial heart may be clearly moved, and the imperial mind show compassion. May vast grace be showered forth, universally inspiring the transformation of peace and harmony; may its blessed moisture be bestowed, fully preserving the lives of all beings. Extending to both the manifest and the hidden, may all equally receive benefit and joy. With pure and sincere intent, we reverently proclaim:

We sincerely venerate the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Gentle Radiance Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.

We revere the Jade Emperor, whose light radiates gentleness. It illumines with clarity, penetrating all without exception. It harmonizes and pacifies heaven and earth, gently subduing demons and evil. Boundaries are freed from afflictions, and times are purged of discord. Today, your disciples, stretching their necks toward the vast heavens, pray for the peace of their lands and the eternal cessation of warfare. May you graciously turn your gaze, ending suffering and plague. May the times be pure and the Dao prosperous, and may songs of praise be heard once more.

With utmost devotion, we prostrate ourselves before the Great Radiant Jade Emperor of Supreme Freedom, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard: When the Emperor’s majesty descends, his position is exalted in the realm of perfect clarity; the Dao is fundamentally non-action, yet its radiance naturally manifests in boundless freedom. Whether to proceed or to pause, to act or to rest—all follows the currents of purity and turbidity, sinking or floating as they may. With purpose and action, yet unobstructed and unfettered, one who grasps this mechanism finds nothing beyond reach; one who comprehends its function discovers all barriers dissolved. Spontaneous and self-so, it is present everywhere without exception.

We, humble servants of the Dao, though dull of understanding, have been graced by the Emperor’s benevolence. Thus, we humbly perform the Lamp Rite, offering this modest token of devotion. Following the prescribed rituals, we establish the precious lamps, making offerings to the Great Radiant Jade Emperor of Supreme Freedom, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and the true numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We reverently pray that the Dao of emptiness and non-being may extend, casting forth the light of boundless freedom. May it safeguard the nation and bring peace to households, ensuring the Yellow River runs clear and the seas remain calm; may it prolong life and increase vitality, fostering abundance for all beings and well-being for the people. May we witness the age of peace and personally encounter the reign of great harmony.

With utmost devotion, we prostrate ourselves and join in praise.

We sincerely venerate the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Radiant Jade Emperor of Supreme Freedom, Heavenly Worthy.

We revere the Jade Emperor, whose position is central to the celestial pivot. Free in coming and going, his transformations are unhindered. His radiance illumines the heavens, his brilliance shines upon the celestial thoroughfares. He bestows blessings upon the upper realms and confers grace upon the mortal world. Today, your disciples, with sincere and earnest hearts, extend their reverence, humbly inviting your divine presence to descend into our humble abode. We pray for your gracious regard, that disasters and misfortunes may cease. May the four seasons be harmonious and tranquil, and all calamities be dispelled.

With utmost devotion, we prostrate ourselves before the Great Beneficent Radiant Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard: As the Teacher of the Three Realms, he compassionately contemplates all beings and awakens the mind of skillful means; as the Compassionate Father of the Four Kinds of Birth, he illumines the dharma-realm and opens the gate of benefit. When his auspicious light shines forth, even the sun and moon pause in their course; when his power of grace is bestowed, it serves as a bridge to the other shore. All who dwell beneath the celestial radiance equally receive the blessings of his benevolence. His sacred virtue is resplendent, his grace vast and boundless.

We, humble servants of the Dao, have long dwelled within the sacred realm, bathed in the Emperor’s radiance. Without the illumination of these lamps, how could we express our gratitude for these fundamental blessings? Following the prescribed rituals, we reverently establish the precious lamps, making offerings to the Great Beneficent Radiant Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and the true numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We reverently pray that his compassionate light may thoroughly illumine and his sacred perception clearly descend. May our bodies transcend a thousand calamities, and may wealth and longevity be eternally bestowed; may our lives be prolonged with a hundred blessings, and may our radiance precede us in times of great peace. May no future hardships arise, and may we forever dwell in abundant fortune.

With devotion and faith, we prostrate ourselves and humbly offer praise.

We sincerely venerate the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Beneficent Radiant Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.

We revere the Jade Emperor, the Lord of Infinite Kalpas. His beneficent light shines forth, illuminating heaven and earth. He serves as a bridge for the multitudes, delivering all beings. From ancient times to the present, his reliability is unwavering, and his blessings extend equally to the great and the small. Today, your disciples, lifting their gaze toward the realm of perfect clarity, kindle lamps and cultivate virtue, presenting their sincere devotion. We humbly pray for your gracious regard, that you may bestow longevity and bless our years. May disasters be dispelled and calamities averted, ensuring eternal security.

With utmost devotion, we prostrate ourselves before the Great Wish-Fulfilling Radiant Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard: The vast heavens are unerring, for their inner realm is harmonious and luminous; the August Emperor is sovereign, for his heart is thoroughly penetrating. His profound perception casts an impartial light, and his radiant splendor shines forth as the light of wish-fulfillment. Those who receive his illumination find no desire unanswered; those who are bathed in his brilliance discover all prayers fulfilled. Everywhere, all hearts find their aspirations met, and every person attains their heart’s desire. His sacred virtue is unfathomable, and the people’s hearts know only reverence.

We, humble servants of the Dao, moved by the profound transformation, seek to exhaust our sincerity. Relying upon this modest cause, we reverently repay the great blessings. Following the prescribed rituals, we establish the precious lamps, making offerings to the Great Wish-Fulfilling Radiant Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and the true numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We reverently pray that the Emperor’s majesty may descend in glory, and that the celestial hearing may not overlook our pleas. May virtuous fruits come to perfect fulfillment—our plans as we wish, our affairs as we desire; may the sprouts of our spiritual cultivation remain unharmed—may we grow old in wisdom, live long in prosperity. May we delight in the covenant of the gulls and rejoice beneath the vast shelter of the wild geese.

With devotion and faith, we prostrate ourselves and humbly offer praise.

We sincerely venerate the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Great Wish-Fulfilling Radiant Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy.

We revere the Jade Emperor, who embodies the Dao within the primordial chaos. Before heaven and before earth, without beginning or end, his wish-fulfilling light shines forth, and his position is exalted in the highest heavens. All prayers are answered, and no wish remains unfulfilled. Today, your disciples, gazing afar toward the Jade Palace, kindle lamps in offering, presenting their earnest and reverent devotion. We humbly pray for your clear perception, that you may look down upon our humble sincerity. May you prolong our years and increase our vitality, dispelling disasters and calamities.

With utmost devotion, we prostrate ourselves before the Great Radiant Jade Emperor of Great Wisdom, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard: His wisdom perceives the subtle and obscure, as luminous as the celestial mirror; his insight penetrates the mysterious and wondrous, for what could be hidden from the Emperor’s heart? The light of wisdom shines upon distant lands, and the power of grace radiates throughout the mortal realm. When one awakens to the subtle truth, the nature of heaven becomes clear; when one grasps its principle, the heart-ground becomes luminous. The foolish may become wise, and the obstinate may be transformed.

We, your disciples, though confined within limited bounds, have long been bathed in the universal illumination. Desiring to express our reverence, we rely upon this offering of praise. Following the prescribed rituals, we reverently establish the precious lamps, making offerings to the Great Radiant Jade Emperor of Great Wisdom, the Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and the true numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

May the four seasons be harmonious, and the three disasters untouched. With unified hearts and minds, we reverently proclaim this offering.

We sincerely worship the Supreme Great Luo Heaven and the Great Radiant Jade Emperor of Great Wisdom.

We revere the Jade Emperor, whose wisdom is perfect and all-pervading. His light extends throughout the universe, and his throne resides in the highest heavens. His achievements are complete, yet he does not claim dominion; the value of his Dao grows ever more exalted. He perceives the hidden and obscure, and his luminous gaze discerns even the dullest. Today, your disciples offer this ritual with utmost reverence. We pray that you may bestow your grace upon us and accept our humble devotion. May the three luminaries emit auspiciousness, and the nine regions be united in harmony. May we forever enjoy primordial blessings and everlasting abundance.

With devoted hearts, we submit ourselves to the Great Auspicious Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard that when Heaven bestows its favor, blessings follow goodness with great illumination; when the Emperor contemplates merit, rare and wondrous signs descend. The precious flame illumines the roots of heaven and earth, transforming darkness into clarity; the jade radiance mirrors the heart of heaven and earth, making the obscure ever more distinct. All beings receive the grace of his illumination, and at no time are they without the advent of auspicious signs. In every transformation and generation, there is benevolence and longevity.

With devoted hearts, we submit ourselves to the Great Liberation Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard that pure liberation manifests its light in the One Reality; sacred wisdom is perfectly all-pervading, encompassing the four great elements. He presides over the three realms and governs the myriad spirits. His subtle radiance dissolves the self-entanglements of suffering, and his numinous brilliance releases the self-imposed bonds of delusion. His celestial light shines afar, and his sacred grace extends widely, so that all beings and creatures receive the illumination of his compassion.

With devoted hearts, we submit ourselves to the Great Refuge Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard that those who turn their hearts to the realm of the Dao engage in cultivation for over three thousand kalpas; those who follow the traces of the Mystery Gate receive the universal illumination of the seventeen rays of compassion. With benevolent hearts set upon salvation, the light manifests as refuge. Those who awaken enter the gate of being; those who comprehend find the path of seeking. The wondrous and profound essence, the resplendent light of compassion, the illustrious virtue, and the unfathomable numinous mechanism—all these we revere.

We, your disciples who follow the Dao, have long felt gratitude and never cease to contemplate the Dao. With utmost sincerity, we offer our humble devotion, reverently establishing the precious lamps in accordance with the rituals, making offerings to the Great Refuge Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and the true numina.

We revere the Jade Emperor, who once dwelled in the Pure Mystery. With a heart set upon salvation, his light radiated as refuge. He illumined the myriad wonders, awakening the deluded multitudes. All beings, without exception, harmonized with non-action.

Today, your disciples gaze afar toward the cinnabar steps. The lamp’s radiance shines brightly, and the faithful receive blessings. The five stars follow their courses, shining brilliantly; the myriad people enjoy peace, and all fortunes are fitting. May the primordial luminaries protect us together, and may the sacred eyes shine as one.

With devoted hearts, we submit ourselves to the Great Merit Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven, the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy, the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign, and all the divine immortals and numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard that to forget merit is true merit, and Heaven’s merit does not claim dominion...

The highest virtue does not claim virtue,
the Emperor’s virtue knows no flaw.
With a heart of compassion and mercy,
He manifests the radiant form of merit and power.
He establishes heaven and founds earth,
shaping antiquity and forging the present.
The nine realms shine with brilliance,
not a single soul untouched by His grace;
the myriad lands glow afar,
all within the three realms bathed in His blessing.
Every being is preserved whole,
every person freed from suffering.

This humble servant, though coarse as straw,
has received the profound grace of rain and dew.
Through diligent cultivation,
I humbly offer this small repayment.
Following the ritual codes,
I reverently kindle the precious lamp,
making offerings to the Great Merit Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven,
the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy,
the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign,
and the true numina and lords of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

May You manifest the six spiritual powers,
radiating a hundred million lights.
The Dao of Heaven is lofty and bright,
nurturing the growth of all beings;
the Emperor’s grace is vast and boundless,
bringing harmony to the four seasons.
Timely afflictions swiftly vanish,
long-accumulated misfortunes are swept away.
With reverence and devotion, I bow my head,
solemnly proclaiming this praise.

With faith, I pay homage to the Supreme Great Luo Heaven,
the Great Merit Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven.

We revere the Jade Emperor,
who from primordial Heaven
accumulated merit and amassed virtue,
embodying the Dao and congealing the mysterious.
His radiance illumines the three realms,
His transformation pervades the eight directions.
Dark and bright realms alike depend on Him,
His fame transmitted through past and present.
Today, Your disciples
concentrate their minds with single-hearted devotion.
Gazing toward the celestial pole,
they kindle lamps and establish the Dharma feast.
May the qi of the Dao flow forth,
bestowing blessings upon the people.
May disasters and pestilence vanish forever,
and abundant harvests be ever preserved.

With devoted hearts, we submit ourselves
to the Great Perfect Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven,
the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy,
the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign,
and all the divine immortals and numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard:
His wondrous form crowns all heavens,
perfect and complete;
His compassionate light illumines the three realms,
fully sufficient, never lacking.
From the Jade Luminance of the Great Subtlety His radiance shines,
His golden hue pervades the Great Existence.
Bathed in His illumination,
the heart of the Dao grows;
enveloped in His brilliance,
the principle of Heaven flows.
All things are harmonized without partiality,
all hearts are fulfilled with beginning and end.

This humble servant, sustained by the center as life’s mandate,
the lowliest of beings,
purifies himself and gazes toward Heaven,
pouring forth his heart to serve the Emperor.
Following the ritual codes,
I reverently kindle the precious lamp,
making offerings to the Great Perfect Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven,
the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy,
the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign,
and the true numina and lords of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

May You manifest the perfect form,
radiating great luminosity.
Rescuing and protecting all beings,
bestowing blessings without dominion;
weighing and measuring all creatures,
judging good and evil with impartiality.
May the roots of life be nourished,
and calamitous destinies averted.
With unified hearts, we invoke and proclaim,
solemnly voicing this praise.

With faith, I pay homage to the Supreme Great Luo Heaven,
the Great Perfect Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven.

We revere the Jade Emperor,
who in the mysterious vault of Heaven
fulfilled His merit and perfected His conduct,
embodying the Dao and replete with virtue.
His compassionate light shines universally,
His benevolent grace extends everywhere.
He nurtures the world,
governing all within the cosmos.
Today, Your disciples
purify their hearts and minds,
gazing toward the cinnabar steps,
reverently repaying the mysterious merit.
The heart of Heaven is manifest,
the people’s desires are fulfilled.
The times are pure, the Dao prosperous,
the year abundant, the harvest plentiful.
With single-hearted sincerity,
we pray for long life.

With devoted hearts, we submit ourselves
to the Great Unobstructed Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven,
the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy,
the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign,
and all the divine immortals and numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard:
The divine mechanism is unfathomable,
where there is being, there is form;
the radiant form is natural,
non-action is thus unobstructed.
His Jade brilliance flows, illuminating all without exception,
His golden hue appears, bringing prosperity to all beings.
He opens the deluded minds of the multitude,
revealing the path to the lost.
Those who understand transcend past and present without hindrance;
those who awaken transform naturally.
With a defiled body,
He attains the supreme Dao.

This humble servant, diligently serving the Emperor,
gazes toward Heaven with devoted intent,
restraining the mind like a monkey or horse,
offering the sincerity of otters and jackals.
Following the ritual codes,
I reverently kindle the precious lamp,
making offerings to the Great Unobstructed Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven,
the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy,
the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign,
and the true numina and lords of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

May You manifest the form of action,
radiating unobstructed light.
The Dao is like the sun at midday,
bringing auspiciousness to the workings of Heaven;
virtue pervades the world,
bringing eternal peace to Earth’s burdens.
May we forever bear the mysterious grace,
long receive the compassionate favor.
With pure hearts and unified devotion,
we solemnly proclaim this praise.

With faith, I pay homage to the Supreme Great Luo Heaven,
the Great Unobstructed Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven.

We revere the Jade Emperor,
who embodies the Dao in its natural state,
most compassionate and most sagely,
primordial before Heaven and Earth.
Abiding in the Jade Palace,
He becomes the world’s field of blessings.
His light shines without obstruction,
His grace bestowed upon those with karmic affinity.
Today, Your disciples
feel profound gratitude toward the Supreme Mystery.
Lamps blaze with crane-like flames,
incense wafts like dragon smoke.
We humbly pray for Your profound regard,
bestowing boundless blessings.
Prolonging life and transcending calamity,
dispelling misfortunes and dissolving obstacles.

With devoted hearts, we submit ourselves
to the Unsurpassable Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven,
the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy,
the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign,
and all the divine immortals and numina of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

We have heard:
Heaven generates divine beings,
each with its destined name.
The Emperor’s compassionate light
is a radiance no power can surpass.
For His wondrous work arises from softness and weakness,
thus His spiritual efficacy cannot be measured.
Great and marvelous, beyond thought,
He manifests clearly.
Grasping this principle,
the few can overcome the many;
understanding this mechanism,
the weak can triumph over the strong.
In beings and in people,
throughout past and present.

This humble servant, revering the sagely transformation,
wishes to be enveloped by the true wind.
Thus, I open the flowery altar,
here to exalt the wondrous model.
Following the ritual codes,
I reverently kindle the precious lamp,
making offerings to the Unsurpassable Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven,
the Sacred Father Heavenly Worthy,
the Sacred Mother Primordial Sovereign,
and the true numina and lords of the Jade Radiance Assembly.

May Your unsurpassable light shine,
Your benevolence be constantly bestowed.
May we swiftly receive the imperial favor,
walking the high path of prosperity;
may we soon encounter peaceful governance,
all ascending the realm of longevity.
With unified hearts, we invoke and proclaim,
solemnly voicing this praise.

With faith, I pay homage to the Supreme Great Luo Heaven,
the Unsurpassable Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven.

Extending to all living beings, may they equally receive auspicious tranquility.
Turning in reverence and faith, we solemnly proclaim this devotion.
With faith, we pay homage to the Supreme Great Luo Heaven,
the Unsurpassable Radiance Jade Emperor of Great Heaven.

We revere the Jade Emperor, whose heart is the Dao.
His light is unsurpassable, his blessings uniquely renowned.
He pervades heaven and earth, embracing past and present.
Soundless and scentless, yet with root and origin.
Today, we disciples, pondering how to repay his mysterious grace,
have established the lamp altar, displaying reverent ritual form.
May You graciously deign to observe and accept our humble sincerity.
May the three disasters be swept away like lightning,
and the five fortunes be bestowed in full.

With utmost sincerity, how shall we pray for the eternal peace of family and nation?
All chant:
Great indeed is the supreme Dao, the primordial Perfected of no origin.
Above, It delivers the heavens; below, It saves the suffering souls.
Above, It has no master or ancestor; the Dao alone is Its body.
Crimson Terrace and Purple Mansion, Golden Gates and Jade Capital.
This wondrous Dharma is concealed,
yet universally blesses all beings.
It erases our ten thousand sins,
and extends our distant years.
Myriad spirits come to pay homage,
while demon kings offer protection.
Merits flourish and prosper,
names inscribed in the Yellow Register.
Through boundless kalpas,
may we endure forever.

*The Jade Emperor’s Heart Seal Scripture*
The three supreme medicines: spirit, qi, and essence.
Vague and indistinct, obscure and profound.
Preserving non-being while guarding being,
in an instant, It is accomplished.
Returning wind blends and harmonizes,
a hundred days’ work is complete.
Silently paying homage to the Supreme Emperor,
twelve years bring ascension.
The wise easily awaken,
the deluded find It hard to practice.
Treading the light of heaven,
breathing the nurturing purity.
Entering and exiting the Mysterious Female,
as if absent, as if present.
Continuous and unbroken,
firmly rooted and deeply grounded.
Each person possesses essence,
when essence is refined to the utmost, it becomes spirit.
Each spirit possesses qi,
when qi unites with the body, it becomes true.
Without attaining the true,
all are but forced names.
Spirit can enter stone,
spirit can make the form fly.
Entering water, it does not drown;
entering fire, it is not burned.
Spirit depends on form to arise,
essence depends on qi to flourish.
Undefiled and imperishable,
the pine remains verdant.
The three medicines share one principle,
wondrous beyond hearing.
When gathered, they exist;
when scattered, they vanish.
The seven apertures are interconnected,
each aperture radiant with light.
Sacred sun and sacred moon,
illuminating the Golden Court.
Once attained, forever attained,
naturally the body becomes light.
Supreme harmony overflows,
bones transform into cold jade.
Attaining the elixir, one becomes numinous;
failing to attain it, one declines.
The elixir resides within the body,
neither white nor green.
Reciting it ten thousand times,
the wondrous principle becomes clear.

Next, recite the sacred titles, proclaim the memorial, and conclude the ritual.
The merits of the Seventeen Lamps of Compassionate Radiance,
offered in devotion, are now complete.

We humbly acknowledge that the Dao is magnified through human effort,
and thus dare to expound the teachings by reciting the scriptures;
humans can magnify the Dao,
but must first expound the teachings by discoursing on the scriptures.
The scriptures reveal the chapters of original conduct,
the lamps manifest the Dharma of compassionate radiance,
that all may know the propagation of this Dao depends on people.
We, by fortunate karmic affinity,
have been graced with compassionate illumination.
Facing the Seventeen Lamps of Treasure, we chant in praise,
gazing upon the transformed body of the Supreme Emperor;
may the myriad beings of the hundred thousand kinds,
bathe in the benevolent blessings of the lofty heavens.
We bow our heads and take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao,
reciting the name of the Radiant and Compassionate Heavenly Worthy,
whose inconceivable merits are complete.

The Rite of the Seventeen Lamps of Compassionate Radiance of the Jade Emperor is now concluded.
