**The Ritual of the Nine Heavens’ Three Mao Celestial Lanterns for the Controller of Destiny**

The ritual proceeds according to form.

We humbly acknowledge that when the Supreme Ultimate divided its form, it towered resplendent upon the land of Huayang. The perfected immortals revealed their traces, their numinous glory illuminating the famed mountains of Juqu. The golden altar is secluded, yet far-reaching in its communion with the jade grottoes. Layered peaks rise in undulating ranks, their mist-laden verdure shimmering; encircling ridges cradle the sun’s radiance, scattering crimson hues. Rare grasses offer their fragrance, and sacred fungi herald auspicious omens. Tigers roar and dragons chant, exhaling winds and clouds; cranes soar above cinnabar terraces as the immortal chariots return. Here dwells the Perfected Lord, who truly governs destiny, rectifying the merits and transgressions of immortals and mortals, wielding the scales of life and death. Not the slightest detail escapes him, nor the most minute fraction eludes his judgment. He governs the Red City, his register inscribed with the Nine Bestowals; he assists the Azure Peak, his office subordinate to the Three Mao Peaks. His sagely virtue and benevolence shine forth, as he oversees the affairs of Heaven, Earth, and Water. From ancient times to the present, all equally bask in his beneficent grace; near and far alike are bathed in his waves of mercy. In the twelfth month and the third month of spring, celestial lanterns blaze with brilliance; beneath the vast heavens, devotees offer incense with reverent devotion. All who revere him receive his protection and blessing.

Today, in praise of the lanterns, this disciple [Name] has long cherished the true wind and for ages sheltered beneath the Dao’s shade. Gazing in awe at the Three Mao Peaks, he has ever held a heart of reverence; pouring forth his sincerity, he looks upward to repay the grace of life and nurture. On this auspicious day, he begins a pure fast, respectfully arranges the sacred banners, and unfolds the wondrous rites. Jade tablets and sacred scriptures are proclaimed by the feathered transcendents; precious staves and golden standards descend from the celestial thoroughfares. With utmost devotion, he kindles the immortal lanterns before the numinous image of the Nine Heavens’ Three Mao Controller of Destiny Perfected Lord. Their light continues the Three Perfected, their radiance equals the Two Effulgences. The Dao’s purple yang qi harmonizes with the vital harmony of the Crimson Palace.

We humbly pray that auspicious blossoms may unfurl, inaugurating felicitous omens this day; that the fruits of the Dao may be perfected, and blessings of fortune and longevity be received in this life. May our modest sincerity be met with boundless favor. Bowing our heads in reverence, we offer praise with utmost devotion.

We, the assembled, with single-minded devotion, take refuge in the Supreme Mystery’s Wondrous Dao, the Void and Sagely Protector, the True and Responsive Perfected Lord, and all the divine immortals and numinous officials.

We humbly acknowledge that from youth he cultivated exceptional conduct, leaving his father to cultivate the Dao upon the Northern Peak. In a dream, the Perfected descended, and he sought a master to inquire into the Dao in the Western City. He obtained the divine tiger’s chariot and personally attended the soaring wild goose’s sandals. Entrusted with secret talismans and divine registers, he received the oral transmission of alchemical formulas and immortal recipes. Thus, he could summon wind and thunder, command dragons and tigers. His divine radiance reached below, and auspicious mists abided within. By day, he drove forth the ten thousand spirits, compelling ghosts and gods to submit; by night, he roamed the eight directions, soaring through the celestial rivers. His position abides in the Nine Heavens, his office governs the Five Peaks. For forty-two years, his sagely rule oversaw the grand enterprise; with a hundred thousand layers of Dao qi, he sheltered all beings. All who express their heartfelt sincerity are surely bathed in his mysterious grace.

Today, in praise of the lanterns, this disciple [Name], respectfully following the immortal statutes and unfolding the wondrous rites, solemnly arrays the image adorned in feathered and embroidered cloud robes, prepares the ritual of incense, flowers, lanterns, and candles, and with single-minded devotion takes refuge in the Supreme Mystery’s Wondrous Dao, the Void and Sagely Protector, the True and Responsive Perfected Lord, Controller of Destiny of the Eastern Peak.

We humbly pray that the wondrous Dao may be fully attained, the Void and Sagely One may manifest his presence, the four seasons may harmonize like jade candles, and the nine autumns may rejoice in golden abundance. May the nation flourish with loyal and good ministers, and households abound in filial piety and fraternal duty. May scholars, commoners, artisans, and merchants each attain their heart’s desires; may the noble and base, the worthy and foolish, all enjoy the pleasures of nurturing life according to their lot.

Bowing our heads in reverence, we offer praise with utmost devotion.

**Homage to the Void and Sagely Protector Perfected Lord**

Void and transcendent, remote and luminous, from youth he was devoted to wondrous words. With hair unbound, he wandered the northern peaks, his heart stilled in forests and marshes, his spirit concentrated in seeking immortality. He ascended perilous heights and traversed valleys, arduously seeking the gates of masters. Casting aside his form, he leapt over peaks, offering himself at a myriad fords. When his elixir was complete, he roamed freely, following his natural inclinations. He then sought a radiant master, who bestowed upon him the sacred scriptures. He cut his hair and knelt in prayer, severed his hand and offered his body. Girded with a rope, he rejoiced in himself, unashamed of hunger and cold. His path was only the Dao, his preservation only the true. His sincerity moved the Supreme Emperor, and he was deeply moved by the Supreme Mystery. Today, he respectfully receives his mandate, his position as the Supreme Primordial.

We, the assembled, with single-minded devotion, take refuge in the Perfected Lord of the Right Prohibition of the Registry of Destinies, the Supreme Dao of Serene Virtue and Wondrous Response, and all the divine immortals and numinous officials.

We humbly acknowledge that he was endowed with a nature of filial piety and integrity, his honor recorded among the eminent scholars of the Gentlemen’s Bureau. His heart held benevolence and forbearance, and he refined the mysterious merits of the Supreme Dao. He received his mandate first, his office sealed as the Registry of Destinies. He oversees the ascent and descent of earthly transcendents, examines the merits and transgressions of the human world. He governs the famed mountains of the Golden Altar and Juqu, presides over the palaces and terraces of the Grotto-Heavens. His martial majesty is stern and solemn, impartial in rewarding good and punishing evil. The Right Prohibition is pure and bright, meting out retribution in secret for transgressions in the open. If one’s devotion in taking refuge is profound, he will surely bestow abundant nurturance.

Today, in praise of the lanterns, this disciple [Name], respectfully following the immortal statutes and reverently adhering to the wondrous rites, solemnly arrays the image adorned in moonlit cloud robes, prepares the ritual of incense, flowers, lanterns, and candles, and with single-minded devotion takes refuge in the Perfected Lord of the Right Prohibition of the Registry of Destinies, the Supreme Dao of Serene Virtue and Wondrous Response.

We humbly pray that the Supreme Dao may extend its vast compassion, the Perfected Immortals may witness our goodness, absolving past errors and granting auspicious signs in our daily lives. May the year’s affairs be abundant, bandits and soldiers vanish, the people delight in their occupations, and the nation and households enjoy peace.

Bowing our heads in reverence, we offer praise with utmost devotion.

**Homage to the Perfected Lord of Serene Virtue and Wondrous Response**

The Supreme One issued a mandate, the Heavenly Perfected inscribed their words. The Ji and Wei clans branched into lineages, first forming the primordial descendants. The Mao family of Xianyang dwelled south of the palace gates. Named Jiwei, he received the mandate as a constant immortal. His position was as the Registry of Destinies, and he concurrently governed the earthly immortals. He was charged with protecting those who possessed the Dao, their lifespans and destinies intertwined. Wherever he attended with diligence and reverence, the laws of the four directions were complete. His palaces and terraces spanned the grotto-heavens, foothills, marshes, and river sources.

It is fitting to govern Danyang and the mountains of Juqu.
May you, my lord, exert yourself therein, that all movements and stillness be observed and heard.

We, your assembled ministers, with devoted hearts offer our lives in homage:
**Perfected Lord of Subtle Wisdom, Serene Virtue, and Wondrous Response—Three Palaces’ Guardian of Life,**
and all divine immortals and spirit-officials.

Of old, your noble conduct and deeds brought renown as Governor of Xihe under the Han;
through accumulated merit you attained the Dao, presiding over the immortal mountains of Liangchang in the northern grotto.
You hold the authority of the Three Offices to safeguard life, and the statutes to restrain the hundred demons and examine spirits.
Your name stands out for brilliance, guiding young novices and later disciples;
your excellence encompasses purity, instructing the female officials of the Wondrous Numinous Host.
You oversee Mount Tai, where in the numinous grottoes the Five Sacred Fungi flourish;
you govern the rivers and seas, whence the water sources nourish the hundred grains.
Every prayer is answered, no wish remains unfulfilled.

On this occasion of offering the Lamp of Praise, your disciple [Name] reverently follows the immortal statutes,
devoutly adhering to the wondrous model:
arraying the image of crane-feather robes and cloud-crowns,
and the rites of streams, springs, and aquatic grasses.
With devoted heart we offer our lives in homage:
**Three Palaces’ Guardian of Life, Perfected Lord of Subtle Wisdom, Serene Virtue, and Wondrous Response.**

We pray that our sincere hearts shine forth and move you, that your serene virtue secretly responds.
Inscribe our names in the immortal registry of the Three Offices’ Guardian of Life,
and erase the records of enmity from the six grottoes.
May rain and sunshine follow their proper order, and malevolent spirits vanish without trace.
May sacred fungi and auspicious grasses manifest blessings,
and wheat, barley, and fine grain yield double harvests.
Let no pestilence afflict creatures, and let the people raise voices of joy.

We bow our heads in homage, offering praise with utmost devotion.
**Perfected Lord of Serene Virtue and Wondrous Response**

You, my lord, were endowed with innate gifts,
your deeds encompassing purity from the outset.
Though late in returning to the true path, your thoughts penetrated to utmost sincerity.
You vanquished the hordes of the Six Heavens, your brilliance marking your name.
Bending to serve the Three Offices, you established your title as Guardian of Life.
You oversee Mount Tai, recording the dead and the living.
Your position is that of an Earth Immortal, the finest of the Nine Palaces.
You exhort and teach young novices, guiding them to Daoist attainment;
you instruct the female officials, imparting the myriad wondrous numina.
You govern the expulsion of the hundred demons, and the statutes to restrain and examine spirits.
You inspect the water sources, whence the rivers and seas flow abundantly.
You apportion the golden grains, and store the registers of jade nectar.
You oversee the planting of dragon fungi and grotto grasses that glow at night.
In the northern grotto of Liangchang, you eternally guard the Yin Palace.

As the libation officials offer their lives in homage, may we attain longevity.
Recitation of scriptures, proclamation of petitions, transformation of merit, and redirection of blessings.
**The Rite of the Lamp of the Three Mao Lords of Life, Under the Nine Heavens, is now complete.**
