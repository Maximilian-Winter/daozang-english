### **Entering the Altar**

Burn the *Purification Talisman* in the water vessel.
Recite the *Heaven and Earth Incantation* and kneel to invoke:

With reverence, we acknowledge the wondrous realm of the *Mystic Capital*, where divine responsiveness arises from the sincerity of even the smallest intent. Though the numinous treasures are difficult to attain, the fragrance of non-action and purity pervades all with a single incense offering.

Your humble servant [Name], trembling with awe, bows his head and prostrates himself twice to reverently address:
The *Celestial Emperor of the Wondrous Transformation of the Primordial Qi of Qingwei*,
The *Celestial Emperor of the Great Florescence of the Purple Palace of Qingwei*,
The *Heavenly Lord of the Supreme Beginning of Qingwei*,
The *August Thearch of Mysterious Heaven, Benevolent and Majestic*,
The *Primordial Lady of Purple Emptiness, Lofty and Pure*,
The *Primordial Lady of Jade Florescence, All-Pervading Wisdom*,
The *Supreme Minister of the Great Mystery, Orthodox Unity Perfected Lord*,
The *Perfected Lord of the Divine Merit of the Inner Minister of Heavenly Mechanism, Wondrous Salvation*,
The *Primordial Lady of the Luminous Congealing of the Golden Watchtower, Guardian of the Dao and Immortal Essence*,
The *Primordial Lord of the Radiant Dao of Dragon Light*,
The *Primordial Lady of Purple Splendor and Jade Wisdom*,
The *Perfected Lord of the Pure Emptiness of the Western Florescence*,
The *Perfected Lord Zhu of Qingcheng, All-Pervading Wisdom*,
The *Perfected Lord Li of Yunshan, Guardian of Unity*,
The *Perfected Lord Nan of Meishan, Concealed in Chaos*,
The *Perfected Lord Huang of Danshan, Thunder Abyss*,
The *Lineage Master, Perfected Lord Ye of Yunlai*,
And all the great lineage masters of past and present who transmitted the Dao, bestowed teachings, and expounded the scriptures.

We humbly beseech your compassion, deign to cast your gaze upon us.

Now, as the *Numinous Treasure* unfolds its radiance, the ancestral *qi* weaves its canopy over the Five Hundred Million, and the wondrous divine merit of the *Mysterious Origin* blazes forth across the Three Thousand. The Dao is supreme, and none are delivered without a master.

On this auspicious day, I, [Name], have chosen this night to memorialize the *Northern Dipper* and the *Polar Star*, beseeching deliverance from baleful stars and the bestowal of blessings to dispel calamities.

We implore you to shake the jade pendants of your girdles upon the celestial thoroughfares and descend in graceful procession. Raise the warp and weft of our Dao, and lodge within the embroidered halls of our morning devotions. The assembly of ritualists, with utmost sincerity, prepares the fast and invokes your presence.

As the fast is observed, the cloud chariots disperse, flowers are scattered, and tea is offered.

Again, your humble servant reverently addresses:
The *Celestial Emperor of the Wondrous Transformation of the Primordial Qi of Qingwei*,
The *Celestial Emperor of the Great Florescence of the Purple Palace of Qingwei*,
The *Heavenly Lord of the Supreme Beginning of Qingwei*,
The *August Thearch of Mysterious Heaven, Benevolent and Majestic*,
The *Primordial Lady of Purple Emptiness, Lofty and Pure*,
The *Primordial Lady of Jade Florescence, All-Pervading Wisdom*,
The *Supreme Minister of the Great Mystery, Orthodox Unity Perfected Lord*,
The *Perfected Lord of the Divine Merit of the Inner Minister of Heavenly Mechanism, Wondrous Salvation*,
The *Primordial Lady of the Luminous Congealing of the Golden Watchtower, Guardian of the Dao and Immortal Essence*,
The *Primordial Lord of the Radiant Dao of Dragon Light*,
The *Primordial Lady of Purple Splendor and Jade Wisdom*,
The *Perfected Lord of the Pure Emptiness of the Western Florescence*,
The *Perfected Lord Zhu of Qingcheng, All-Pervading Wisdom*,
The *Perfected Lord Li of Yunshan, Guardian of Unity*,
The *Perfected Lord Nan of Meishan, Concealed in Chaos*,
The *Perfected Lord Huang of Danshan, Thunder Abyss*,
The *Lineage Master, Perfected Lord Ye of Yunlai*,
And all the great lineage masters of past and present who transmitted the Dao, bestowed teachings, and expounded the scriptures.

We humbly beseech your compassion, deign to cast your gaze upon us.

Now, as the *Primordial Beginning* suspended the *Jeweled Pearl*, unfolding the wondrous decree of delivering humanity, and the *Venerable Lord* ascended the *Jade Bureau*, inaugurating the mysterious statutes for resolving calamities—these can preserve life and extend years, dispel disasters and deliver from misfortune.

May the transmission to the virtuous be unbroken, generation after generation, and the good affinity thus proclaimed be relied upon, life after life. May all return to the true Dao and escape the deluded ford.

Reflecting upon myself, I planted good roots in past lives and early embraced the true Dharma. Yet, unworthily entrusted with the duty of practice and transmission, I dare not lag in its propagation, though I remain benighted in the steps of cultivation and advancement. My apprehension runs deep; without the refining influence of your molding, how could I attain the mechanism of efficacy and trustworthiness?

I, [Name], now enter the intent and receive the liturgy, performing the rites with reverence and strict adherence to the prescribed forms.

Gazing upon the *Polar Star*, I invoke the *qi* and burn the talisman. Arraying the star altar, I model heaven and emulate earth. Without the august presence of the lineage masters, how could this rite unfold?

We humbly implore you to dispatch generals and troops to descend upon this altar, sweeping away all defilements and impurities, and drawing near the true banners. Whether tasked with sealing decrees or providing dedicated protection, assigning offices or transmitting sincerity, may our communion be felt, and the mysterious favor thus manifested.

Now, I purify my heart and dispel desires, contemplating the Dao and meditating upon the true. Relying on the upright *qi* for support and the auspicious radiance for illumination, the true fire scorches and purifies the five viscera, while the numinous wind brushes across the three fields. Transforming this mortal frame, it fuses into the wondrous form.

May the *flying *gang** be wielded with precision, the *qi* harmonized with the spirit. Recognizing the true form amidst the vast and boundless void, it appears like an image in a mirror. Seeking the original destiny within the numinous luminosity of wondrous being, it responds like an echo in a valley.

May the winds and clouds be serene, the stars and constellations resplendent. As the memorial is received, may the grace of abundant blessings descend, and our heartfelt prayers be answered through divine communion.

Your humble servant, trembling with awe, bows his head and prostrates himself twice, reverently awaiting the arrival of the mandate. Thus, I speak with utmost sincerity.

Recite the *Golden Light Incantation*, visualize the deities, and pace the *gang*.
Burn the talisman to summon the generals.

The *Northern Dipper* has its generals, who assist the turning of the *jade armillary*, rewarding the good and punishing the wicked, scrutinizing transgressions and falsehoods. By the command of the *Jade Thearch*, their might guards the *Jasper Pool*. Hearing my summons, let them hasten like wind and fire to descend upon this altar, without delay.

The *General Overseer of the Unified Qi*, the *Bureau of Thunder*, burns incense and dispatches the talisman to summon:
The *Swift Memorializing Messenger of the Mysterious Pivot, Fang Yangzhong*,
The *Heavenly Lord Wang Zhi, Auxiliary of the Great Unity of the Mysterious Dipper*,
The *Heavenly Lord Gong Hong, Controller of the Numinous Response of the Armillary*,
The *Heavenly Lord Liu Qian, Guardian of the Pivot of Illustrious Origin*.

May they heed the summons and swiftly descend to the ritual altar, entrusted with our commission.

Clad in feathered robes and girded with the *Seven Stars*, they discern the fortunes and misfortunes of the human realm with unerring clarity.

By imperial decree, the talisman commands their descent:
The *Immortal Messenger Yang Ruming, Bearer of the Goat in the Dipper*,
The *Great Immortal Messenger Geng Miaozhen, Bearer of the Alms-Bowl in the Dipper*,
The *Perfected Lord, Supreme Minister of the Level Pivot*,
The *Attendant of the Dipper’s Mechanism*.

Hearing this summons, hasten to the altar, entrusted with our commission.

The spirits of the Central Heaven, the essences of the Dipper’s radiance,
To the left stands Ruming, to the right stands Miaozhen,
Their numinous power unfathomable, emerging from darkness and entering the unseen.
We now hasten the summons—swiftly attend the altar court.
To defy our command is to rebel against the imperial will.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Northern Emperor’s Rescuing Summons Decree.*

The *Commander of the Unified Qi*, the *Branch Bureau of the Thunder Palace*, issues the flying talisman to hasten the summons:
The *Swift-Flying, Urgent Memorializing Messenger of the Dipper’s Mysterious Pivot, Marshal Fang*,
The *Assisting Guardian of the Mysterious Dipper, Grand Unity Heavenly Lord, Marshal Wang*,
The *Wandering Mechanism, Numinous Response, Commander of All Perfected, Heavenly Lord, Marshal Gong*,
The *Guardian of the Illustrious Origin’s Pivot, Heavenly Lord, Marshal Liu*,
The *Dipper’s Goat-Bearing Immortal Messenger Yang*,
The *Dipper’s Alms-Bowl-Bearing Great Immortal Messenger Geng*,
The *Supreme Minister of the Level Pivot, Perfected Lord*,
The *Attendant of the Dipper’s Mechanism*.

Each divides their presence, transforming into qi to descend,
Inspecting the lamp altar, revealing matters with clarity,
Disasters and fortunes made manifest, karmic responses fulfilled.
In prayer, we rely on the gods—
Their numinous power resplendent, transformations boundless,
Achieving without action, arriving instantly at the call.
Within the blink of an eye or the raise of a brow, they ascend to the Nine Heavens.
In the turn of a head or the clap of a hand, they traverse the Three Realms.
All requests are answered, no wish unfulfilled.

By virtue of their current office, they are charged on this day to act on behalf of [Name],
Who this night offers divination and petitions the Dipper’s Pole,
Praying for the bestowal of gracious command.
Specifically, for [Name]’s protection and peace,
We humbly beseech the Dipper’s immortal messengers,
To bear the talismanic decree and reverently knock at the *Numinous Response Palace of the Northern Dipper’s Mechanism*,
Petitioning:
The *Nine Celestial Star Lords of the Northern Dipper’s Supreme Dao*,
The *Nine August Ladies of the Northern Dipper*,
The *Multitude of Dipper-Officed Numinous Officials*,
To descend together upon the star altar and witness the covenant’s observance.
May the proclamations be relayed, and all be granted as petitioned this day.

When the immortals are summoned, may they arrive;
When the sages are invoked, may they attend.
Present this talisman, uniting with the luminous great heart.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Primordial Descent Decree.*

Now we humbly beseech the mighty power of the *Heavenly Physician of the Dipper*,
The *Multitude of Great Numinous Officials*,
The *Spirits of Disaster Relief*,
To convene with the *Guardians of the Worn Talismans*,
The *Thunder Bureau’s Officials and Generals*,
The *Earthly Deities’ Supreme General Wen*,
The *Orthodox Unity’s Wind-and-Fire Numinous Official Ma*,
The *Altar-Executing Marshal Zhao*,
The *Earth Bureau’s Grand Marshal of the Year Gu*,
The *Marshall Guan of the Fengdu Illuminating Numinosity*,
The *Fierce Marshal of the Vast Expanse Wang*,
The *Vice Marshals of the Various Bureaus*,
The *Memorializing Merit Recorders*,
The *Immortal Youths and Officials of Talismanic Water for Driving Away Evil and Curing Illness*,
The *Officials and Generals of Karmic Response in Charge of Numinous Might*,
To descend as one upon the lamp altar,
To examine the truth of matters,
To assist in the ritual’s execution,
To propagate the teachings’ power.

We further request the assembly of the *Five Blessing Gods of the Inner Court*,
To swiftly inspect all within [Name]’s field of existence,
Revealing the auspices and omens of the future with clarity.
Thus may divination be precise, karmic response unerring,
Upholding the Dipper’s numinous law above,
Fulfilling the people’s earnest pleas below.
May well-being serve as proof, and gracious resonance be granted.
We stand before the altar, awaiting the manifest response.
*As the occasion demands, respond to the Celestial Worthies’ call.*
*Each bows to the master, contemplating as prescribed by the method.*

The Guardians of the Numinous, Essence of the Mystic Dipper and Primordial Radiance,
The Three Pure Ones shine resplendent.
The myriad perfected open the Dao, sweeping away calamitous hordes.
The Eight Might Jade Talismans universally proclaim to the ten thousand spirits.
The Nine Celestial Guards stand ready, seizing evil and slaying demonic essences.
Extending years without end, attaining longevity and eternal life.
The Luminous Youths stand guard, defending the Imperial Court.
Starlight penetrates all darkness, divine qi suffuses the four voids.
Severing the heads of the Six Heavens’ rebels, subduing the assembly at Mount Feng.
Binding and dispatching to the Northern Wastes—dare any delay?
Golden spears restrain forms, the Imperial Dao shines forth in rectitude.
Subdued souls and spirits, in union with the Dao, attain perfection.
The mighty deities of the eight directions sweep away filth and dispel miasma.
The Seven Primes descend, jade tablets inscribe names.
Riding the luminous chariot, ascending to the Jade Clarity.
Strike the Dharma drum twenty-four times.

The Supreme Three Heavens, the Primordial Qi of the First Origin,
The Most High Five Numinous Venerable Lord,
Summon forth from within us:
The Three and Five Merit Officers,
The Left and Right Attendant Envoys,
The Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon-Riding Couriers,
The Golden Lads who attend the incense,
The Jade Maidens who transmit words and scatter flowers,
The Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and the Incense Officials of the Day—
Each thirty-six in number—emerge.
Emerging, they don their solemn attire, robes and sashes adorned with pendants.
They report to the Mystic Altar, the Celestial Thearchs and Perfected Ones,
The local earth gods and territorial deities of this place.
We now ascend the altar to present our petition,
Reverently submitting this matter for consideration.
All earnest sincerity has been recorded and made known.
May we receive the life-generating qi of the Most High’s Ten Directions of True Perfection,
Descending to flow into our bodies,
That the sincerity of our supplication swiftly reach
The August Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven of the Supreme and Boundless Dao,
The Northern Pole Purple Tenuity Great Thearch,
The Nine August Star Lords of the Northern Dipper in the Celestial Presence.
The True Light Illuminates the Heavenly Worthy.

Light the lamps and recite the incantation:
By the Emperor’s decree, the Dipper lamps are kindled.
The Seven Kings descend to succor all living beings.
Left Assistants and Right Supporters manifest their numinous might.
The Heavenly Peng Marshal commands the immortal hosts.
The Five Thunder Envoys, the Six Jia and Six Ding,
The Great Sage Dark Warrior, the Three Stars of the Terrace—
They cure illness, dispel misfortune, and turn death into life.
Those who defy the decree perish; those who receive salvation live.
Mighty power descends, slaying and beheading demonic spirits.
The three hun return to the body; the seven po are pacified.
A single illumination of the Dipper lamp brightens body and dwelling.

Burn the True Talisman to summon the Nine August Ones.

Your humble servant [Name], offering profound reverence, petitions:
The Great Saintly Celestial Pivot of the Northern Dipper’s Net-Pole Palace, the August Star Lord of Greedy Wolf,
The Northern Dipper’s Numinous Pass Palace, the Prime Minister, the August Star Lord of Giant Gate,
The Northern Dipper’s Purple Pole Palace, the Minister of Works, the August Star Lord of Store of Wealth,

We reverently gaze upon the Dao’s compassion,
Humbly beseeching the descent of luminous radiance upon this altar.
Scrutinize our petition, clearly reveal auspices and omens.

Should the signs manifest in the flicker of lamp-light,
Or subtly reveal themselves in the patterns of things—
With single-minded reverence and silence,
May all ten thousand prayers be fulfilled.

Your servant bows twice in profound gratitude,
Humbly welcoming the sacred presence.
As the cloud-borne chariot descends in truth,
I now offer my petition once more.
Having already received your luminous descent,
I bow again in deepest reverence,
Presenting pure wine and fragrant tea in solemn offering.
Scattered blossoms, cast into the basin—
The talisman serves as divination,

We reverently gaze upon the Dao’s compassion,
Praying for the radiant mirror of your scrutiny to turn and illumine us.

Your servant has heard:
As the Pure Tenuity governs the turning of the ages...

Unfurling the upright qi throughout the Purple Tenuity,
The Great Ultimate unfolds its chart, illuminating the Mystic Radiance of the Northern Pivot.
The Canopy of Flowers reflects the depths of the Jade Enclosure,
The Curved Array arrays the loftiness of the Golden Gates.
Lifting and guiding the Dark and Yellow, steering the Imperial Chariot to align the Seven Governances;
Commanding and regulating the warp and weft, grasping the Celestial Stem to establish the Five Phases.
The Flying Cleaver descends upon the Tortoise Chart,
The Radiance of Astral Strands shines upon the Phoenix Tablet.
Majestic are your merits and virtues,
Resplendent are your numinous powers.

We humbly recall: though we planted good roots in former lives,
And were born to comprehend the turning of the Dao,
We ascended in flight yet trod upon soul and spirit,
Failing to unite with the Vacuous and Nonexistent.
We drifted and dispersed, confounding our essence and spirit,
Mired in turbid dregs.
Our transgressions easily fill the steelyard’s scale,
Our merits scarcely accumulate in the blade’s measure.
Bending beneath your vast compassion,
We are molded to the office of the Mystic Charge.

Your servant, so-and-so, acting on behalf of so-and-so, having chosen this propitious day,
Tonight offers morning audience to the Dipper’s Pivot,
Solemnly beseeching to harmonize the stellar courses for so-and-so,
And pray for peace and protection.

On this occasion, reverently following the original descent,
We earnestly invite such-and-such a general
To advance and bow before the Purple Pivot’s Mystic Axis,
Hastening to present the petition of the heart,
That it may ascend and be heard by the Imperial Pivot.

We prostrate ourselves in hope:
May the Primal August One bestow illumination,
May the Jade Imperial One shed forth radiance.
Command the Five Emperors and Four Offices
To inscribe our good deeds upon the Azure Tablets.
Unseal the Three Bureaus and Nine Treasuries
To dissolve calamities and hardships from the Mystic Registers.
We pray for the grace of your sheltering protection,
To console the anxious longing below.

Your servant, with awe and trepidation,
Kowtows and bows deeply, prostrating before the altar.
Awaiting the response of your Mystic Grace,
We shall prepare the written petition,
And reverently proceed to proclaim and present it.

Proclaiming the petition, we fumigate the document and consign it to the incense burner,
Burning it along with the accompanying talismans.
The talismans are to be transmitted in sequence:
May the August Emperor bestow favor,
May the Seven Perfected and Immortal Numinous Ones...
[...] inspect the demonic camps,
[...] descend,
To eternally preserve peace and tranquility.

Hastily, hastily, as in the statutes and ordinances!

Prostrating in silent audience, we perform the Three Bows in gratitude.

The officiating minister [Name], with reverent solemnity, humbly presents this petition in profound sincerity:

To the Supreme Venerables of the Dipper and Pole:

The Multitudes of Divine and Numinous Officials of the Dipper’s Center;
All the Officers and Generals subordinate to this oratory;
And all the Perfected Ones descending to the Lamp Altar.

We reverently beseech your Dao compassion to turn and cast your luminous gaze upon us.

Your servant has heard that from the Jade Palace of the August Emperor, the morning radiance descends, and the cedar’s age unfolds in luxuriant splendor.

The Jade Secretariat of the Dark Pivot receives the celestial fragrance, and the mushroom-sealed missives flow like streams. Only through the profound resonance of stillness and response does one契 the subtle luminosity of the hidden and manifest. Moreover, the Nine August Ones suspend their images, streaming their essence downward to illumine the earthly quadrant; the Eight Trigrams take form, receiving their purest quintessence to accord with the celestial measure. Gazing upward to the encompassing model, we are ever winged; with bellows and keys, we never transgress.

Now your servant, earnestly devoted to the Purple Ultimate, has purified the Flowery Hall. Arraying the majestic rites of the world’s appearances, we have prepared the protocols and methods for the audience with Heaven. To dispel calamities and cross tribulations, to entreat blessings and prolong life—yet we fear that this servant’s defiled and turbid frame has presumptuously assumed the mandate of morning cultivation. The arcane and subtle essentials remain obscure, and the method of transmission and reception is not understood. In facing the divine, we may err; in visualization and contemplation, we may falter. We humbly hope for lenient guidance for later learners and rely upon the amnesty of past transgressions.

Next, we pray that the Seven Origins guard our forms and the Nine Numinous Ones bestow life. Commanding the majestic stars to withdraw, may a hundred blessings arrive in full. Directing the radiance of virtue to descend upon the threshold, may the Three Calamities dissolve and vanish.

Above, we wish for the Heavenly Origin to be serene and tranquil, the earthly order to be peaceful and secure; for the Two Luminaries to link as pearls, the Five Planets to unite as jade discs. May the seasons harmonize like the Jade Candle, laying the foundation for the state’s prosperity and great fortune. May the year be blessed with golden abundance, fulfilling the common people’s wish for whole and flourishing lives. Thus shall the great transformative compassion of the Most High Heavenly Worthy be manifest above, and below, our sincerity in surrendering our lives be answered.

We reverently submit this memorial for your hearing.

Resuming the vow before the incense burner:
The Envoys of the Incense Palace, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the Attendant Numinous Officials of Incense—we, in the place where we have just performed our audience and memorial, invoke the spontaneous arising of the golden liquid and the cinnabar essence of the Elixir. May the Hundred Spirits and Multitudes of Perfected Ones gather here before this incense burner. May our cinnabar sincerity ascend to reach the divine, and may the mysterious boon descend to bestow itself.

May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend and convey the fragrant smoke bearing the sincerity of our just-offered memorial, swiftly reaching and directly ascending to the Most High Boundless Dao, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, and the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity of the Northern Ultimate.

Before the Dao of the Great Sage of the Central Heaven, the Nine August Star Lords of the Northern Dipper, and upon the completion of the memorial rites at the Mysterious Pivot of the Qingwei Tradition.
