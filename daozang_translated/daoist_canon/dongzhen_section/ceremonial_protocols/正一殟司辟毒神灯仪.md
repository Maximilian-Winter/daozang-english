**The Rite of the Orthodox Unity’s Pestilence-Warding Lamp of the Wenchang Bureau**

The ritual proceeds according to form.

We humbly observe: when primal chaos first divided, qi and form were distinguished. Nüwa severed the turtle to establish the axis; Yi and Qi observed the celestial patterns to bestow the seasons. The Three Powers were apportioned into three, the Five Phases disseminated into five. Thus, qi divided into seventy-two seasonal nodes, and the year was fixed at three hundred and sixty days. Through transformation, the spirits and gods act; through subtlety, yin and yang govern cold and heat.

Heaven hangs its signs, and fortune or misfortune becomes visible. Humankind receives its nature, and blessings or calamities arrive of their own accord. Thus, the wellspring of blessings flows to families that accumulate goodness, while disaster and fault inevitably approach those who do evil. Fortunately, there exists the path of prayer and supplication, and the gate of expedient means stands open.

Now, the faithful devotee [Name], dwelling beneath the canopy of heaven and earth, abiding under the shelter of the Dao, rectifies the mind and sincerely offers reverence to Heaven and the gods. Establishing the numinous altar, they perform the pure jiao offering. Incense smoke drifts in ethereal clouds; lamp flames blaze like stars in the azure vault. The jade terrace grows cold beneath the moon, and immortal robes fade into the distance; the azure firmament is swept by clear winds, and cloud-borne chariots soar.

Perceiving this earnest offering of vegetarian repast, may the gods deign to descend in solemn regard.

We humbly pray that luminous virtue be abundantly bestowed, and vast grace poured down, augmenting future blessings and dispelling past transgressions. May myriad fortunes converge, all demons be vanquished, and no harm or disaster befall, granting ease and peace. May golden script record an imperishable name, and the azure tablets inscribe the method of extended life. We further implore your protection, offering utmost reverence.

Bowing in homage, we take refuge in the Boundless Dao.

We, the assembled, with sincere devotion, take refuge in and offer our lives to the Eastern Plague-Commanding Marshal Zhang.

We humbly observe: above the Great Void, among the honored of the heavens, the nine-colored radiance arises naturally, unassisted by the illumination of the Three Luminaries. From the sun, moon, and stars above to the seas, mountains, and rivers below, all who incline their hearts to serve the Emperor fulfill the rites of vassalage. Palaces and chambers, halls and pavilions—some are wrought of treasures, others formed of clouds and mist. Vast and indistinct, they are the courts of the insubstantial; pure and boundless, they are the halls of luminous communion.

On days of fasting, the host of spirits gathers. Winds arise, and the purple heavens resound; incense smoke ascends, and the clear breeze forms talismanic script. Countless immortals, the thirty-two Perfected Lords—none fail to assemble at the Jade Capital and ascend to the Golden Portals.

Now, the faithful devotee [Name]’s silver lamps blaze brilliantly, and sandalwood incense wafts in curling clouds. We earnestly pray for your descent and reverently offer this hymn of praise:

Arrayed in silver lamps, they transform into jeweled canopies.
Resplendent with radiance, like falling stars they descend.
The celestial retinue of the Nine Heavens lingers in descent,
Enveloped in five-colored auspicious clouds and misty vapors.
Command the Three Officials to dispel calamities,
That epidemics and pestilence may all be healed.
The Wenchang Bureau and its retinue drive away evil and expel demons.
Bestow blessings, avert disaster—we offer reverence without cease.

We, the assembled, with sincere devotion, take refuge in and offer our lives to the Southern Plague-Commanding Marshal Tian.

We humbly observe: the August Thearch, in hidden virtue, watches over the people, and thus commands the divine host of the Pestilence Bureau to apportion Heaven’s decrees of fortune and misfortune. Those who accumulate goodness enjoy abundant blessings and may dwell in peace; those who accumulate evil suffer lingering calamities and cannot escape reproof.

The Sage of the Wenchang Bureau wields mighty authority. The Marshal of the Primordial Heaven holds great power and exalted office. In the days when King Wu governed the world, it was the time when the Perfected One of Mount Kuang attained the Dao. Riding the wind upon qi, who could pursue his immortal chariot? In secluded valleys and deep ravines, his divine traces remain visible today.

His honorific title is "Harmonizer of Pestilence"; his sacred mandate is "Serene Clarity." Though pestilence arises from the great Dao, it is summoned by human action. Yet the scrutiny of the gods adheres to virtue alone.

Now, the faithful devotee [Name] offers incense like drifting clouds and arranges lamps in the pattern of the stars. We earnestly pray for your descent and reverently offer this hymn of praise:

We look up to invoke the Five Pestilence Lords, the august and sacred emperors.
May they turn their keen perception and broadly bestow saving grace.
Marshal of the Primordial Heaven, extend your favor to all.
Your mighty spirits to left and right suffer no obstruction.
Master of Mount Kuang, harmonize pestilence and repel plague.
Withdraw pestilence, gather toxins—blessings extend to descendants.
Envision your cloud-borne chariot descending to the altar’s precincts.
Protect and shelter this household, that they may forever rely on your divine refuge.

We, the assembled, with sincere devotion, take refuge in and offer our lives to the Western Plague-Commanding Marshal Zhao.

We humbly observe: the great furnace of creation, in its impartiality, covers and shelters all; the open net of governance watches over humanity, and good and evil receive their due recompense. The warnings of vigilance and introspection, the solemn texts of reverent devotion—these are transmitted in the *Yi* of Fuxi and recorded in the *Book of Zhou*. Fortune and misfortune lie within ourselves; blessings and calamities have no fixed gate.

Those whose years are not prolonged suffer for their past transgressions; those who inherit lingering misfortune do not endure Heaven’s cruelty. If one can repent of wrongdoing, a hundred blessings will naturally arrive; if one does not reform, the six extremes will inevitably follow.

Thus, there exists the Pestilence Bureau to uphold Heaven’s mandate.

Within a twelve-year cycle, the Year Sovereign metes out rewards and punishments; across the five directions, generals are empowered to wield authority. The mighty Fànmó King aids the sagely with fierce might; the divine Tàibǎo Zhāng Kāng ever manifests in wondrous efficacy. May the thunderous might of lightning and storm be concealed, and blessings of felicity be bestowed.

Thus does the faithful devotee [Name] now kindle lotus lamps and burn incense whose fragrance fills the lion-thrones. Earnestly we pray for your descent, and reverently chant in praise:

Mighty Fànmó King, incline to the great work of creation.
Tàibǎo Zhāng Kāng, may your temple’s visage be honored and serene.
The Twelve Year Sovereigns, exalted by the Emperor’s decree.
The Envoys of the Five Directions, who expel violence and banish evil.
Upright and discerning, they commend loyalty and shelter filial piety.
Vast in transformation, cool and clear, they long to shelter and embrace all.

We, your servants, with devoted hearts submit our lives to the Northern Pestilence Envoy, Shǐ the Messenger.

We humbly observe: august Heaven shows no partiality, the great Dao does not cling to form. Its power subtly perfects the myriad things; its radiance illumines the four quarters. To prolong fortune and life, there exist rites of exorcism; whether man or woman, all receive the grace of its sheltering embrace. The Pestilence Bureau, descending to the mortal realm, dispatches disease with the ferocity of ghostly kings and induces sweat through the divine efficacy of its envoys. Through fortune and misfortune it transforms humanity; through calamity and blessing it descends upon the world. Ever good at saving beings, it harbors no intent to harm; boundless in delivering people, it possesses the virtue of cherishing life. Thus do yin and yang wax and wane, cold and heat alternate; the twelve pitch-standards remain impartial, the four seasons and six qi follow their measure. Pestilence divides into thirty-six kinds, while seventy-two spirits array the signs. When the heart sprouts goodness, disaster dissipates; when the mind contrives wrong, calamity arrives. Should we offer reverent devotion, health and harmony will surely be granted.

Thus does the faithful devotee [Name] now scatter fragrant incense and array glowing lamps. Earnestly we pray for your descent, and reverently chant in praise.

The thirty-six ten-day periods govern the seasons’ qi,
The twenty-four spirits oversee the gates’ clepsydra divisions.
The seventy-two spirits receive their mandate in due time,
The twelve pitch-standards—Yellow Bell and Great Budding foremost.

Black banners, flashing blades, fangs long and beasts immense:
These are Heaven’s decrees, the protection of all living beings.
Compassion turns the countenance, divine might stills transgression.
Guard and bless this household with health, peace, prosperity, and longevity.

We, your devoted servants, now wholeheartedly submit our lives,
To the Central Plague-Quelling Envoy, Master of Pestilence.

Thus has it been since the sages of old first established the rites,
Transmitted through unbroken ages, manifesting divine power,
Then spreading worship to every region.
Erecting altars and shrines in obedience to Heaven’s command,
Dwelling within the land’s bounds to display majestic might.

Fine wine and choice offerings arrayed in cups and platters, rich and pure;
Crimson eaves and jade-green tiles adorn halls and palaces, solemn and grand.
Some are Daoist immortals, some great bodhisattvas of the Buddhist gate,
Some heroes of antiquity, some worthies of ages past.
Some are rendered in painted likeness, some shaped from clay;
Receiving offerings from one region, drawing reverence from a thousand leagues.

Now the faithful devotee [Name] kindles crimson candles, their glow undimmed,
Burns purple sandalwood, its fragrance lingering like mist.
All people gaze in awe, scholars and commoners alike turn in devotion.
The assembly, with utmost sincerity, reverently chants in praise:

Spirits of prefectures and towns, lords of humanity,
Earth gods and city gods, receiving blood sacrifices for a thousand years.
Divine beings of temples and shrines, their fame resplendent,
Worthies of ages past, traversing the four seas.
The rites of this land endure unchanged.
May your penetrating gaze descend in joyful presence,
Guard and bless this household, that it may forever know no terror.

Recitation of scriptures, proclamation of petitions,
Offering of paper money, dedication of merit—
The Rite of the Orthodox Unity’s Pestilence-Dispelling, Toxin-Averting Spirit Lamp is now complete.
