### **Xuandu Precepts Text**
#### **The Precepts of Void and Non-Differentiation Between Good and Evil**

1. Abandoning form and forgetting the body, as if dead—this is called *void*.
2. Diminishing the mind and discarding intentions, casting off falsity and forsaking desires—this is called *non-being*.
3. Concentrating spirit and accumulating essence, not allowing things to gather—this is called *purity*.
4. Returning spirit and ingesting *qi*, settled and unmoving—this is called *stillness*.
5. Dwelling in seclusion, one’s merits and name unseen—this is called *subtlety*.
6. Forsaking wife and children, wandering alone with the Dao—this is called *solitude*.
7. Breathing in harmony, smooth and fine—this is called *gentleness*.
8. Relaxing the body and freeing the form, attending to all matters—this is called *weakness*.
9. Despising honor and embracing disgrace, content in poverty and humiliation—this is called *lowliness*.
10. Shunning excess and fleeing fullness, clothing and food coarse and simple—this is called *reduction*.
11. Contending with *yin* and *yang*, responding to changes and repelling evil—this is called *timeliness*.
12. Neither hungry nor thirsty, neither cold nor hot, neither joyful nor angry, neither sorrowful nor delighted, neither slow nor hasty—this is called *harmony*.
13. Loving sight and hearing, loving speech and thought, without expending spirit, blending light and conforming to the world—this is called *thrift*.

**The Precept states:** These thirteen principles merge into the primordial chaos of *void* and *non-being*. Those who practice the Dao and guard the True must revere the teachings of their masters, follow the celestial decrees, and exhaust the Dao of *non-action*—*void, non-being, purity, stillness, subtlety, solitude, gentleness, weakness, lowliness, reduction, timeliness, harmony, thrift*.

For those who cultivate the Dao, refining *qi* and transforming form, the people will be harmonious, the state peaceful, families auspicious, disasters will not arise, lifespans will extend, and households and nations will flourish.

Those who violate the precepts will be punished by Heaven.

**The Precept states:** If one does not contemplate good deeds but only commits evil acts—being unfilial to parents, disloyal to masters and lords, unfaithful to rulers—those who do good will be blessed by Heaven, while those who do evil will be cursed by Heaven.

- One who performs **one good deed** will have a settled mind and a peaceful body.
- One who performs **ten good deeds** will have strong *qi* and vitality.
- One who performs **twenty good deeds** will be free from illness.
- One who performs **thirty good deeds** will obtain what they seek.
- One who performs **forty good deeds** will enjoy prosperity and wealth.
- One who performs **fifty good deeds** will have flourishing descendants.
- One who performs **sixty good deeds** will escape calamities.
- One who performs **seventy good deeds** will be protected by divine spirits.
- One who performs **eighty good deeds** will gain the benefits of the earth.
- One who performs **ninety good deeds** will attain honor and glory.
- One who performs **a hundred good deeds** will receive Heaven’s virtue and precious treasures.
- One who performs **two hundred good deeds** will have their name renowned in later generations.
- One who performs **three hundred good deeds** will bring great wealth to their descendants.
- One who performs **four hundred good deeds** will produce noble and wealthy descendants.
- One who performs **five hundred good deeds** will extend the lifespan of their descendants.
- One who performs **six hundred good deeds** will produce loyal and filial descendants.

- One who performs **eight hundred good deeds** will produce descendants of virtue.
- One who performs **nine hundred good deeds** will produce sagely and worthy descendants.
- One who performs **a thousand good deeds** will produce immortals and perfected beings.

Those who perform good deeds will receive blessings and protection from Heaven.

- One who commits **one evil act** will have a troubled mind and a weary body.
- One who commits **ten evil acts** will have depleted blood and *qi*.
- One who commits **twenty evil acts** will suffer many illnesses.

### **Precepts and Verses of Prohibitions**

1. **Do not deceive ghosts or cheat spirits**, nor trifle with the celestial Dao.
2. **Do not take the false as true**, nor the true as false.
3. **Do not take good as evil**, nor evil as good.
4. **Do not take the crooked as straight**, nor the straight as crooked.
5. **Do not take the turbid as clear**, nor the clear as turbid.
6. **Do not take the perverse as upright**, nor the upright as perverse.
7. **Do not take the ugly as beautiful**, nor the beautiful as ugly.
8. **Do not take the empty as solid**, nor the solid as empty.
9. **Do not take the contrary as compliant**, nor the compliant as contrary.
10. **Do not take the wrong as right**, nor the right as wrong.
11. **Do not take the close as distant**, nor the distant as close.
12. **Do not take east as west**, nor west as east.

**The Precept states:** These thirteen prohibitions are the ways of those who are deluded and confused. Their bodies will suffer harm, and they will not preserve their lives. Disasters will flow into five generations, and descendants who violate them will have their lifespans shortened and their allotted years seized. Those who preside over such violations will be demoted according to the severity of the offense.

**The Precept states:** Always respect and follow the master’s teachings, adhering strictly to their methods. Do not act lightly, deceive, or falsify. Violators will be penalized with a reduction of four hundred days in their allotted lifespan, and those responsible will be demoted.

**The Precept states:** Regularly at dawn, noon, and dusk, visualize the *qi* of the five directions:
- The **eastern blue *qi*** transforms into the Azure Dragon,
- The **western white *qi*** transforms into the White Tiger,
- The **southern red *qi*** transforms into the Vermilion Bird,
- The **northern black *qi*** transforms into the Dark Warrior,
- The **central yellow *qi*** transforms into one’s own body.

Thus, harmonizing the five directions, one chants and recites their names.

**Violators of this precept will be penalized with a reduction of three hundred days in their allotted lifespan, and those responsible will be demoted.**

**The Precept states:** At dawn, recite the following:
*"Subtle and vast, you are the essence and radiance of primal *qi*.
Majestic and joyous, you soar as my soul and spirit.
Dwelling within my breast, you expand in emptiness and boundlessness.
Pure as the bright moon, you penetrate the ten directions.
How flourishing the sacred herbs—no fear of lacking sustenance.
Inhaling the new, exhaling the old, you thereby commune with the divine."*

**The Precept states:** At dusk, recite the following:
*"Vast and awe-inspiring, in reverence for the divine,
Clad in essence, nourished by the mysterious,
The Dipper’s handle as steed, its stars as spokes,
Boundless above and below, timeless in coming and going.
A hundred ailments healed, the spirit and *qi* sustained,
The Controller of Fate records it in jade tablets and cinnabar script,
Bound with golden threads, wrapped in white silk,
Countless eons assured—no further doubt.
The Great One protects me, the divine uphold me.
In purity, free from thoughts, face the prosperous earth.
Recite this, wear the talisman, and the officer pledges with Heaven and Earth.
Those who cultivate the Dao and delight in the Dharma shall recite it.
Failure to comply incurs a penalty of five years’ reduction in lifespan, and those responsible will be demoted."*

**The Precept states:** On *wuchen* and *wuxu* days, recitation is forbidden. Instead, maintain a single-minded focus on the Dao, with eyes free from reckless gazing, mouth free from reckless speech, mind free from reckless thoughts, and ears free from reckless hearing. Violators will be penalized with a reduction of fifty days in their allotted lifespan.

Calm the spirit and settle the will, honor virtue and power, and revere teachers and elders. Failure to comply—showing disdain for virtue and power, or disrespecting teachers and friends—brings misfortune to the household and ruin to the state, with a penalty of two twelve-year cycles in lifespan reduction, and those responsible demoted for a thousand days.

This refers to treating teachers, friends, and those of virtue and power with the reverence due to them.

**The Precept states:** Be magnanimous, loyal, filial, reverent in morning practice, detached, compassionate, and benevolent. Cultivate filial piety and sincerity, and act with righteousness. Failure to comply incurs a penalty of seven twelve-year cycles.

Do not invoke spirits under false pretenses, assume official titles without authority, slander teachers or defame the Dao, engage in licentious sacrifices to myriad ghosts, subvert truth, or create unauthorized rituals contrary to the master’s teachings. Violators will suffer harm to themselves, and those responsible will be penalized for five years.

**The Precept states:** Do not eat food at dusk, nor consume offerings to spirits. Violators will be penalized with a reduction of a thousand days in their allotted lifespan.

This means one should not eat even at dusk, and consuming food offered to ghosts or spirits incurs guilt.

**The Precepts on Medicinal Virtue**

**The Precept states:** Virtue dispels calamity, and medicine cures illness. Those who disregard these precepts will, as rulers, forfeit their reign; as households, lose their descendants; as individuals, invite chaos and misfortune, with vital *qi* dispersed and lifespans diminished. Thus, governing without the Dao or speaking without the Dharma results in the loss of lifespan and cycles, the Recording Deity reports the transgression, and the Controller of Fate strikes one’s name from the register.

**The Precept states:** Virtue is the physician, and conduct is the medicine. Those who neglect virtue and conduct while seeking medicine or amassing petitions, yet fail to reform their actions, incur even greater transgressions.

**The Precept states:** Gentleness, humility, and the abandonment of desire are the repository of medicinal virtue. Violators will be penalized with a reduction of five years in their allotted lifespan, and those responsible will be held accountable.

The Precepts state: When a person suffers from illness, it is due to transgressions and misdeeds, hidden in the unseen, thus manifesting as sickness. These afflictions do not arise from diet, wind, cold, warmth, or qi, but because the individual has violated the law and broken the precepts. Their spirit and soul are constrained and punished, not residing in their physical form. Their pores become lax, their organs depleted, and their essence and qi unguarded, daring to pursue profit. Though they may dwell in honor and fine attire, they dare not commit wrongdoing. They measure their body to make clothing and gauge their stomach to take food. Though rich and noble, they dare not indulge in desire. Though poor and humble, they do not transgress the precepts. Thus, naturally, there is no cruelty without and no illness within.

**The Hundred Precepts on Illness**
The Precepts state: Seeking to avert disaster and eliminate hardship is not as easy as preventing them. Treating illness and curing disease is not as auspicious as cultivating oneself. If one serves parents and teachers with filial piety, serves one’s lord with loyalty and reverence, and treats friends with sincerity and trust, those who violate the precepts will be penalized by a twelve-year reduction in their lifespan, and the responsible officials will bear the affliction upon themselves.

The Precepts state: Those with lords cannot protect their states; those with ministers cannot preserve their lives. The sage seeks blessings before omens appear and severs misfortune before it arises. For disasters grow from the slightest beginnings, and illness arises from the most subtle origins. Small virtues, if not accumulated, will not bring great fortune. Those who do evil, though they may wish to rely on fragile vows, wear talismans, and protect themselves, if they refuse to change their hearts and minds, their sins will not be erased. They will also be penalized by a reduction in lifespan, and the five diseases will enter their bodies.

The Precepts state: One should constantly reflect on the sins and transgressions that bring illness. The Deities of Transgression, the Deities of Absolution, the Lord of Transgression, and the Lord of Absolution will absolve all sins, all worldly misdeeds one has committed, and thus the illness will be dispelled.

The Precepts state: If one can eliminate these one hundred and one illnesses, there will be no disasters or misfortunes. One will attain longevity and transcend the world, and one’s descendants will receive blessings.

The Precepts state: Among the myriad people under heaven, those who are taught about sin and fortune yet violate the laws will have illness enter their bodies, their lives forfeited in the registers of punishment. Their names will be erased from the records of the living, and their bodies will perish.

When one commits a transgression, one should reform one’s heart and change one’s conduct, upholding the Dao and its laws, and dare not again act in ways that incur the punishment of gods and spirits—thus half their offenses may be absolved. If one does not violate the laws, all transgressions may be overcome, and one shall attain longevity.

**Statutes and Precepts**
The Precepts state: For Daoist priests, female officials, Daoist followers, register initiates, and commoners who pledge allegiance to a master, when the father passes, the son shall succeed; when the elder brother dies, the younger brother shall continue. Only the rightful heir may inherit; no other may do so. If the child is young and weak, an adult shall act as steward until the child comes of age and resumes governance as before. If there is no one to inherit, one must trace back to the original lineage and may not transfer allegiance to another. Violators shall be penalized with a twelve-year reduction in lifespan.

The Precepts state: After the passing of the original master of Daoist priests, female officials, register initiates, or Daoist followers, if their descendants are unfit to inherit or the lineage is lost due to chaos, the original master’s lineage shall be traced to its source. If no connection is found, they may seek a new master to whom they shall pledge allegiance, adhering to the teachings and laws, for this concerns the master of their very lives. To disrespect or neglect one’s master is to defy the gods; in governing a state, this brings chaos; in managing a household, it leads to ruin. Such misfortune extends to one’s ancestors and descendants.

The Precepts state: For male and female officials, register initiates, and Daoist followers, the Heavenly Tribute Rice is the most precious treasure of Heaven, the great token of the Registers of Life. It must not be treated lightly, for fortune and misfortune arise from it. The seventh day of the seventh month is the time for superior merit, the eighth month for middling merit, and the ninth month for lesser merit. Those who submit on the fifth day of the tenth month shall neither gain merit nor incur fault; all offerings must be delivered to their respective oratories. Violators shall have their names stricken from the Registers of Life, with no celestial officials to guard them. This penalty extends to seven generations of ancestors and descends to all descendants. The head of the household shall be penalized with a two-hundred-day reduction in lifespan, and each member of the household shall suffer a twenty-four-year reduction.

The Precepts state: Male and female officials and oratory heads shall oversee households and oratories, each ranked according to grade and title. For a first-rank oratory, the tribute rice from its people shall be one hundred *hu*: seventy *hu* shall be used for the oratory’s needs, and thirty *hu* shall be forwarded to the Celestial Master’s oratory. For two hundred *hu*, all shall be presented at the original oratory. If the distance exceeds three hundred *li*, offerings may be prepared at home. Failure to comply shall incur a thirty-six-year reduction in lifespan.

The Precepts state: For the birth of a son, an upper offering shall be made; for a daughter, a middle offering. This increases the household’s prosperity, seeks official protection, and ensures the family’s safety for the year. The upper offering is for seeking deliverance from calamity, safe travel, or promotion in office. The middle offering is for healing illness, resolving official disputes, or securing release from imprisonment. The lower offering shall be omitted here. Such are the graded statutes and laws. Violators shall be penalized with a twelve-year reduction in lifespan.

The Precepts state: Male and female officials, oratory heads, and register initiates shall report the number of their household’s vows at the year’s beginning. If fewer than ten people complete the vows by year’s end, a feast for twenty shall be prepared. For thirty or more, a feast for twenty-four shall be held. Even for households of a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand, the feast shall not exceed twenty-four people. One person may be feasted per vow, up to a maximum of twenty-four. Violators shall be penalized with a twelve-year reduction in lifespan.

The Precepts state: Male and female officials, oratory heads, and register initiates shall follow the graded statutes for vows. For fewer than ten people, twenty *chi* of silk shall be offered; for twenty or more, forty *chi*. These shall be submitted upon receiving favor. Failure to comply shall incur a twelve-year reduction in lifespan.

The Precepts state: On the three assembly days, male and female officials and oratory heads shall provide feasts, distribute cloth, and allocate tribute rice. Recently, however, officials have compelled commoners to supply these assemblies, which contravenes the statutes. Violators shall be penalized with a twelve-year reduction in lifespan.

The Precepts state: For the birth of a son, a feast for ten shall be held, along with one hundred sheets of fine paper, a pair of brushes, a cake of ink, and a writing knife. For a daughter, a feast for five shall be held, along with a mat, a dustpan, and a broom. These shall be submitted by the end of the month. Failure to comply shall result in the parents losing twenty-four years of lifespan, and the child shall also be penalized. The Celestial Master’s oratory shall not take more than its due, nor may offerings be diverted for private use. Such offenses are grave, leading to the destruction of one’s person.

The Precepts state: Male and female officials and oratory heads shall ensure that those who follow the Dao retain their original lineage. Recently, however, officials have recklessly accepted households from others, a fault of the oratory heads who fail to instruct according to the statutes and hastily take charge. The ignorant commoners, believing it permissible, act as they please, disregarding the old traditions. The oratory heads shall bear the penalty of usurpation, while the people shall suffer the guilt of rebellion. The master shall report the matter, and the Heavenly Bureau shall surely intervene. Violators shall each be penalized with a twelve-year reduction in lifespan.

The Precepts state: When male and female officials, register initiates, and Daoist followers prepare offerings, the head of the household shall fast and invite guests the night before, examining the status of those invited. All shall be solemn and orderly, avoiding impurity. They shall bathe, change into clean robes, headscarves, coarse garments, trousers, and unlined jackets, and may not wear skirts or expose their clothing, lest they show disrespect to the Perfected. This is because these precepts carry the authority of the Heavenly Officials, and immortals descend to witness them—is this a trifling matter? All shall compose their minds and focus their thoughts, refraining from idle chatter or mundane matters. They shall follow the order of their registers and methods. If their ranks are equal, precedence shall be given to those initiated earlier. If they received their registers and oratory positions on the same day, the elder shall take precedence. Even if one holds an external office of higher rank, it shall not supersede an internal oratory position. If precedence is not observed, a separate order shall be established. Violators shall be penalized with a twelve-year reduction in lifespan.

The Precepts state: For male and female officials and oratory heads, the upper offering shall include five *sheng* of wine and three hundred coins per person. The middle offering shall include four *sheng* of wine and two hundred fifty coins per person. The lower offering shall include three *sheng* of wine and one hundred coins per person.

Governor A shall collect one hundred *hu* of civilian grain tax, of which eighty *hu* shall be delivered to the administration of B and C, and twenty *hu* transmitted to the Celestial Master’s administration. Governor A shall also collect one hundred *hu* of civilian grain tax in rice, of which eighty *hu* shall be delivered to the administration of D and E, and twenty *hu* transmitted to the Celestial Master’s administration. For all public oath offerings, the measurements shall be calculated as above and transmitted to the myriad people under heaven. For every *hu* of rice, two *dou* shall be allocated for messengers to deliver to the Celestial Master’s administration. If the rice fails to arrive, the Celestial Master’s administrators shall bear the penalty of reduction. Only paper, brushes, and ink shall be supplied for administrative use and need not be transmitted upward. Each shall strictly adhere to their duties; violators shall be penalized with a thirty-six-year reduction in lifespan.

The Precepts state: Should male officials, female officials, administrators, or commoners fall ill or encounter misfortune, those who urgently report it must be attended to with utmost haste; none shall use such occasions to advance private matters, fabricate calamities or malevolent influences, curry favor, or accept bribes—all such acts shall be calculated as offenses warranting reduction. Violators shall be penalized with a twelve-year reduction in lifespan.

The Precepts state: At the beginning of the year, male officials, female officials, administrators, and Daoist households shall register their dependents, including any illnesses or hardships, and make sincere vows, all of which shall be recorded in sworn statements. Administrators shall submit these reports as received, and upon the expiration of the grace period, the offerings shall be rendered, after which merits and labors shall be reported. None shall renege on their vows or breach their agreements, for such offenses are not minor. If no blessings are received, the vows shall be annulled, and no unwarranted claims shall be made. Even if deaths or reductions in household numbers occur during the year, the tax shall not be adjusted and shall be remitted as usual. All shall reverently comply. Violators shall be penalized with a twelve-year reduction in lifespan.

The Statutes state: Male officials, female officials, and administrators shall carefully select means to deliver the people and must not act perfunctorily or defile themselves with worldly filth. In transforming the people through purity and emptiness, all shall examine their written pledges, verify their circumstances, and ensure harmony among all household members, great and small, before disseminating the teachings and delivering them in accordance with the regulations. Violators shall be penalized with a two-year reduction in lifespan.

The Statutes state: Daoists, female officials, and administrators shall punish deceit and falsehood, pacify the Four Seas, receive the people with propriety, and nurture all living beings. On the three auspicious assembly days, they shall present themselves before the Heavenly Officials, instruct the ignorant masses, and disseminate merit and virtue, ensuring harmony between humans and spirits. Yet of late, many officials have slaughtered livestock to supply their kitchens and feasts, which contravenes the hidden laws. Seeking life through killing distances one from life itself. Offenders shall bring calamity upon future generations, and administrators shall be penalized with a twelve-year reduction in lifespan.

The Statutes state: Male officials, female officials, administrators, and register disciples who pacify through the virtue of Heaven shall establish altars on *jia-yi-bing-ding* lands, graded by rank. A household altar shall measure eight *chi* in width and one *zhang* in length. A medium altar shall measure one *zhang* two *chi* in width and one *zhang* four *chi* in length. A large altar shall measure one *zhang* six *chi* in width and one *zhang* eight *chi* in length. Its entrance shall face east, and the furnace shall be positioned at its center. Violations of these altar regulations shall be penalized with a twelve-year reduction in lifespan, adjudicated in accordance with the *Mengwei* statutes.

The Statutes state: Male officials, female officials, and administrators who receive titles of register and office are akin to royal appointments, and all selections and appointments shall proceed from the Heavenly Terrace. Yet of late, many officials have presumptuously conferred ranks upon one another in private, bestowing greater registers upon those who received lesser ones or transmitting the methods they themselves bear. Such acts contravene the hidden canons. Those deemed capable shall submit petitions for approval. Violators shall each be penalized with a twenty-four-year reduction in lifespan.

The Statutes state: Male officials, female officials, and administrators of the Yangping, Lutang, and Heming altars may appoint four *zheng* and itinerant altars. Those of the Lutang and Heming altars may appoint three *zheng* and itinerant altars. All others shall be subordinate to the Celestial Master’s altar. In receiving methods, one shall assume duties according to the weight of their merit and rank, without acting carelessly or seeking greater altars indiscriminately. Violators shall be penalized with a twenty-four-year reduction in lifespan.

The Statutes state: Daoists, female officials, administrators, and register disciples shall perform morning and evening audiences on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month. They shall rise at cock’s crow, compose their countenances with reverence, don their caps and sashes, and, clad in robes, headbands, and seated mats, enter the altar in accordance with their ranks, hold their *hu* tablets, and perform the audience rites. Upon completion, they shall review the registers as per the old statutes. When departing to pay respects to their masters, they shall bow five times, inquire after their well-being, and then withdraw. On *wu-chen* and *wu-xu* days, no audience shall be held. Violators shall be penalized with a twelve-year reduction in lifespan.

The Statutes state: Male officials, female officials, administrators, and register disciples who forget or neglect the audience on *ji-wu* days shall be demoted one rank and penalized with a three-year reduction in lifespan. Those who fail to attend shall be demoted three ranks and penalized with a seven-year reduction. Failure to attend the audience with one’s master shall incur examination and punishment, for willful absence is a grave offense against Heaven and Earth.

The Statutes state: Male officials, female officials, register disciples, and Daoist households with defilements in their homes shall not enter the altar beyond the last day of the lunar month. Those in mourning shall refrain for three days. Those in three-year mourning that has not yet concluded shall not enter the altar, perform rites, or submit memorials or documents for one hundred days. Violators shall be examined and penalized with a twelve-year reduction in lifespan.

The Statutes state: Those who pledge themselves to the Dao shall vow to follow it until death, without wavering or hesitation, betraying the Dao and its virtue, or renouncing the Dao to return to secular life. Such offenses are not minor, and calamity shall befall their entire households. They shall also refrain from licentious sacrifices to evil spirits. Offenders shall submit written confessions to the Grand Altar, sincerely repent, and thereby avoid misfortune. Those who knowingly violate these precepts shall be penalized with a twelve-year reduction in lifespan.

The Statutes state: Daoists, female officials, and administrators, from the day they receive the Dao, shall cultivate themselves inwardly and ward off disasters outwardly. They shall not act recklessly, harm the common people, engage in hunting or fishing, or compete with one another, suppressing those more accomplished than themselves. Such conduct befits the deaf and blind, not the true essence of the Dao and its methods. Offenders shall be punished with eighty lashes, and administrators shall impose the penalty. To redeem such offenses, four *liang* of jade shall be offered as restitution.

The Statutes state: Daoists, female officials, and register disciples who have reached the age of eighteen may receive the Great Method. For external methods, from the Register of the One Hundred Fifty Generals upward, they may don yellow ritual robes and caps. For internal methods, from the *Zixuan Zhenwen* upward and below the *Shangqing Dadong*, they shall wear purple ritual robes, brown garments, *hu* tablets, shoes, trousers, and seated mats. The *hu* tablet shall be held by those who have received the Ten Precepts and above. For morning audiences, rituals, assemblies, and memorials, they shall be fully attired in ritual garments, caps, brown robes, *hu* tablets, and shoes. Violators shall forfeit eight *liang* of jade, and the penalty shall extend to three generations, including themselves, as adjudicated by the Water and Fire Officials in accordance with the jade statutes. Before the Three Sovereigns, the people were simple and unadorned, and rituals were rudimentary, hence the *ban* tablet, flat at both ends. After the Human Sovereign, it was called the *hu* tablet, symbolizing Heaven’s roundness and Earth’s squareness. All officials hold it, ever mindful of Heaven and Earth, embodying the Dao, and revering it as the law prescribes.

The Statutes state: Daoists, female officials, libationers, and register disciples who hold office in the methods and vows, upon death, must lie in state within the oratory or altar and shall not be kept in secular residences. This means that funeral rites and burials shall not take place among the laity. If their souls reside in defiled ground, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water shall not permit their corpses to be examined or tormented, and they shall be sentenced to three years of labor in the Yellow River.

The Statutes state: The Yangping, Lutang, Heming, and other altars, along with their male officials, female officials, administrators, and register disciples, shall teach and transcribe the regulations as set forth above. Yet of late, many officials, commoners, and Daoist households—some without masters, establishing their own methods; others far removed from their original altars, scattered across the countryside—have privately conferred titles, led households, and wielded authority at will...

Some, though not far removed from their altars, have become isolated and cut off, leading to the seizure of commoners’ property and fragile goods, which have lain abandoned for years. These they privately appropriate for themselves, failing to report or submit them, creating their own laws without proper transmission or authority. They violate the unseen statutes in countless ways, their transgressions manifold.

As a result, the true Dao is obscured, truth and falsehood indistinguishable. The rhythms of qi are disrupted, and malevolent forces proliferate. Those who suffer calamities and endure punishments—how grievous it is! All this stems from the repeated failures of those in charge, who have not promoted the sagely transformation, leaving the ignorant in fear and confusion. They assume such transgressions are trivial, unaware of the statutes, ordinances, and regulations, each with its distinct purpose. All must be made known, proclaimed, and disseminated. Reward the virtuous and punish the wicked, spurring one another to vigilance. Examine matters with precision, ensuring that diligence is met with its due virtue. Those who violate these precepts shall be recorded by the Earth Official, their names linked and reported upward for investigation and punishment according to the law. If the responsible officials fail to expose such offenses, they shall share the same guilt.

Proclamations must be issued, and all shall comply with the statutes and ordinances of the Mystic Capital as follows.

**Statutes on Memorials and Petitions**

The Statutes state: Those who suffer misfortune—declining fortunes, repeated disasters, the loss of descendants, illness and debility, unfulfilled desires, imprisonment, depletion of qi and blood, extreme poverty and hardship, premature death, madness, deafness, or muteness—those who give rise to treacherous ministers or rebellious children, whose families are ruined by madness or possession, who are executed in the marketplace, whose remains are lost, who perish by water, fire, blade, or banditry, whose fields and silkworms fail, whose clothing and food are insufficient, whose official careers stall—all these stem from their sins. The Offices of Fault and Judgment, the masters of their households, and the officials within their altars have harmed them, examining the transgressions of their past lives, bringing down the consequences of their misdeeds.

All such cases must be documented with details: the prefecture, county, village, age, gender, household size, residence, and the name of their master. The facts must be verified, the ancient principles followed, and the circumstances clearly stated. These memorials shall be presented to the Libationers of the altars under the Celestial Master, to the Devout Masters who oversee the households. Petitions shall be submitted in accordance with the seasons—spring, autumn, winter, and summer—with bows and reverent gestures, continuing until the cheeks are flushed with sincerity.

Such memorials and petitions are offered to the heavenly courts to absolve sins, dispel calamities, and invoke blessings.

The Statutes state: In Luoyang’s Pure Abode, the Celestial Master, following the immortals, migrated west to the Red City of Shu. The world was turbid and impure, the age chaotic and unjust. Thus, he grasped the Pillar of Heaven, stood at the Gate of Heaven, and revealed the new Dao of Orthodox Unity and Alliance of Powers, seeking to purify the relationship between heaven and humanity, punish the guilty and unjust, and nurture all living beings. He established the Twenty-Four Altars, appointing twenty-four male and female officials, and through the grace of the Primordial Mystery, enlightened future generations. All who repented their transgressions were granted the rank of Perfected.

Each month, three memorials may be submitted to repent of sins, sever karmic ties, and eliminate disasters and illnesses. In times of dire urgency, three memorials may be submitted in a single month.

The Statutes state: When entering an altar to submit a memorial, one must attire oneself in proper robes and cap, sit upright, and visualize the generative qi of the Five Directions and the functionaries and soldiers within one’s own body, aligning them according to their positions. One must act as though the deities are present, standing to the left and right, before and behind.

This means that when entering an altar to submit a memorial, one must clear the mind and focus the intent, fully invoking the presence of the divine.

The Statutes state: When entering an altar to submit a memorial, avoid the days of *wu-chen* and *wu-xu*. Do not submit memorials during periods of defilement, nor on the last or first day of the lunar month. The people of the world must not approach altars or meet their masters while in a state of defilement. Violations shall be punished by the deduction of years from one’s lifespan, and the transgressor shall incur the very sins they sought to avoid. All such offenses shall be prosecuted by the Offices of Fault and Judgment.

The Statutes state: When entering an altar to submit a memorial, one must proceed with dignity, following the proper order to the left and right with solemn reverence. Men and women must not intermingle, nor may one gaze about, speak irreverently, or move too hastily or slowly. If the responsible officials or functionaries fail to enforce this, they shall be demoted one rank. If they do not demote themselves, they shall be fined three *liang* of jade and penalized by the deduction of twenty-four years from their lifespan.

The Statutes state: Daoists must not recklessly submit memorials on behalf of men or women guilty of evil and rebellion. Such offenses include licentiousness, theft, violence, treachery, disobedience to parents or masters, disloyalty to rulers or elders, disrespect for the Dao and its power, irreverence toward spirits, harming others, deceit, slander, betraying parents, rebelling against masters, and all manner of unfilial or unvirtuous conduct. None guilty of such acts may submit memorials.

If they do so within a year, five years shall be deducted from their lifespan, and upon death, they shall be handed over to the River Earl for penal servitude. They shall also be fined eight *liang* of jade and demoted two ranks.

The Statutes state: Memorials must be plain and unadorned, unskilled yet not cunning, simple yet not ornate, truthful yet not false, direct yet not convoluted, clear yet not verbose, modest yet not vulgar, pure yet not turbid, forthright yet measured, concise yet sincere. Such memorials move heaven and earth, stir the spirits, ascend to the heavenly courts, and receive swift response. Violations shall be prosecuted by the Offices of Fault and Judgment, and the responsible officials shall be held accountable.

The Statutes state: To alleviate illness, face the Ghost Gate. To dispel disaster, face the Earth Portal. To seek longevity, face the Heavenly Gate. To attain wealth and honor, face the Earth Portal. To counter slander and curses, face the Human Gate. To suppress tigers, face *yin*. To suppress snakes, face *si*. Aligning with the Celestial Stem brings great fortune.

The Statutes state: To seek wealth and honor, submit memorials on the day of *wu-zi*, the Day of the Heavenly Granary. To seek official rank, submit on the Day of the Heavenly Treasury, avoiding days of self-punishment. The days of *wu*, *you*, *hai*, and *chen* are days of self-punishment. *Yin* punishes *si*, *xu* punishes *wei*, *zi* punishes *mao*, *shen* punishes *yin*, *mao* punishes *zi*, and *si* punishes *shen*. Violations shall result in punishment by flogging and fifty days of illness.

The Statutes state: Memorials and petitions to absolve the sins and sufferings of deceased ancestors, as well as to address one’s own illnesses, disasters, fortunes, and misfortunes, shall be submitted through one’s original altar. If one’s master is too distant, one may approach another of the same tradition.

Should one who is neither a lineage ancestor-master nor a *jia*-rank Libationer overseeing households and governing altars submit a memorial, it shall not reach the Celestial Bureaus. From *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding* and below, all are considered as submitting in response. Those who oversee three hundred households or more serve as Healing Officers; those who oversee three households or more serve as Office Stewards—all are considered as principals.

The Statutes state: To cultivate blessings and prolong life, to dispel disasters and harm, and to treat the hundred illnesses caused by malevolent influences, submit memorials facing east. To absolve ancestral tombs of debts, to open the heart and sharpen the mind, and to pass through calamities and crises, submit memorials facing west.

The Statutes state: In times of dire calamity and mortal peril, to seek life from the midst of death, to subdue evil and suppress demonic forces, submit memorials facing north.

The Statutes state: To cultivate the body and nurture the nature, to attain warmth, prosperity, and the fulfillment of ten thousand wishes, submit memorials facing south.

The Statutes state: All memorials shall be presented with sincerity, standing upright in trustworthiness, to verify the resolve of the heart. They shall be pledged with the officers and soldiers of the Dao, and the statutes must not be violated.

The Statutes state: When Heaven removes one destined for death, Heaven reduces the sentence. In such cases, it benefits the many—do not imitate others. For later generations and descendants, this is the blessing of the aged.

All ordained Daoist officials, female officers, and both common and newly initiated lay followers shall not share food or drink with households engaged in reckless and defiled sacrifices. Those of such households invite one another, drinking wine and eating meat, men and women gathering together, young and old speaking and laughing as they please—this is what I forbid. Do not be misled by the desires of the mouth and stomach, causing the ceaseless coming and going of demonic qi, thereby inviting disaster. One ought to regulate the officers and soldiers within the body, for all shall bear the name of impurity and prepare in advance. If afflicted by harm, do not complain or resent.

The Statutes state: All ordained Daoist officials and female officers shall not frequently send lay followers to perform purifications or exorcisms, for these are rife with taboos, fostering deceit and falsehood, acting on private whims and suspicions, and harboring impure intentions—ultimately, they shall not receive the grace of the Dao. Deceit and falsity will bring their own suffering, and prolonged indulgence shall yield no benefit to the body. This is forbidden by the statutes and may incur resentment toward Heaven.

The Statutes state: Daoist officials and female officers shall not permit lay followers to privately worship spirits or ghosts, to slaughter pigs and sheep, or to spread heretical and bewildering speech. Such false practices are all forbidden by the Dao. If any such conduct appears, it must be severed entirely. Violations of these statutes breach the prohibitions of the Registers and shall incur a penalty of one *ji*.

The Statutes of the Mystery Capital conclude.
