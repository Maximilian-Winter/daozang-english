**The Supreme Scripture of the Twelve Superior Grades of the Flying Celestial Dharma Wheel’s Exhortations and Precepts**

Transmitted by the Supreme Perfected One to the Left Immortal Elder:

Our original master, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, was then in the Jeweled Palace of the Great Canopy Heaven of the Many Treasures, within the Natural Fragrant Realm of the Flower Terrace of Dao and Virtue. Without forsaking the mind of causation, he vowed to deliver all sentient beings. From quiescence he stirred, moving with the mind of equanimity. For the sake of expedient means, he opened the gates of wondrous mystery, unfurling great compassion and kindness. With the Dharma of non-action, he benefited and rescued the three temporal realms. Thereupon, he manifested a transformation body, named the Vacuous Sovereign.

The title of the Vacuous Sovereign is called the Lord of the Dao. The transformations of the Lord of the Dao pervade the ten directions and the three thousand great thousandfold boundless worlds. In each world, there are manifold lands; in each land, he manifests manifold transformation bodies; from each transformation body, he emits boundless light; within each light, he reveals manifold true images; each true image radiates a halo bright as the sun, luminous and penetrating the heavens. Beyond the sun in the sky, no darkness remains unilluminated. The wondrousness of this perfect clarity allows all obstructions to be transcended. Sentient beings receive his grace, and both the animate and inanimate respond with gratitude. The three evil destinies cease their opposition, and the six paths ascend and progress. Heavenly beings overflow in abundance, hells become empty and still, all places are purified, and the Dharma realms shine with radiance.

Thereafter, he gathered all the radiant light, returning it to merge with his body. His true form became serene and still, revealing the subtle and wondrous. Again, he plucked his golden fingers, emitting a jade-like sound. At that moment, bells and drums resounded of themselves, celestial immortals leapt with joy, golden censers and jeweled altars were suffused with fragrant smoke. All heavenly beings and boundless multitudes each augmented their virtuous power, assembling together in non-action. Their spirits awakened to understanding, worldly concerns instantly forgotten. They entered the source of meditative wisdom, beholding the boundless sagely beings, and together saw the Supreme Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning.

At that time, the Celestial Worthy addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct and the great assembly, speaking thus: "Today is auspicious, this moment is also auspicious, your minds are likewise auspicious, and the great assembly is auspicious. Therefore, I shall for your sake initiate the workings of compassion, to protect and shield the world, those of meager blessings and inferior merit—all sentient beings may ascend and progress, not allowing them to regress and perish. Thus, I now establish the supreme embankment, fostering and safeguarding all beings, advancing the worthy and good. This is called the Nine Wondrous Precepts of the Perfected Ones, the radiant light of wisdom. The three realms and ten directions take refuge and receive them with faith. Therefore, I now expound them to bring peace and happiness to all beings, truly as I have spoken."

At that time, the assembly, having foreseen the discourse, each composed their minds, knelt in reverence, and prostrated, surrendering their lives to the sagely honored one. Universally, they wished for great compassion to bestow upon them the venerable precepts. Thus, they earnestly entreated for half a kalpa. The gods scattered incense, the multitude of sages offered treasures, and they bowed their heads three times in supplication, their resolve unwavering.

Then, the Celestial Worthy, seeing their earnest entreaty, joyfully declared it good. Thereupon, the Compassionate Honored One spoke again: "All sentient beings, due to ignorance and delusion, due to greed and attachment, ultimately dwell in the long night, thus reaching annihilation. My concern and compassion surpass that of parents, my kindness and forbearance are profound. It is like a child falling into a deep pit—dark, perilous, and filled with venomous serpents. The parents, hearing of this, are overcome with great sorrow and pity. First, they recite divine incantations to restrain the venomous serpents, preserving the child’s body from being devoured. With sturdy ropes and jeweled poles, and with hooks and ladders, they command strong men to enter and assist, ensuring all emerge and stand upon level ground. Yet the children, foolish and ignorant, unaware of fear or caution, may suddenly fall again, surely losing their lives. The parents, once more, beseech the Celestial Worthy, devising further strategies. They teach divine incantations to subdue the venomous serpents, again providing jeweled poles, only then departing from the perilous pit.

Now, my method is likewise. The bottomless three evil destinies are no different from a deep pit; the myriad sufferings and poisons are like venomous serpents. All sentient beings are my children, and I esteem these precepts. This divine text and incantation can cause ignorance to vanish in a single thought. This is the Dharma of peace and happiness, the path of superior progress, revered and upheld by the sagely and worthy of the three temporal realms. Even the thirty-two heavens and the five hundred million earthly realms, emperors and empresses, crown princes and princesses, all ministers and officials—at the outset of their reigns—should all uphold and recite them.

Furthermore, all those of the Daoist mind, whether ordained or lay, the four assemblies of men and women, whether noble or base, whether reclusive or worldly, all sentient beings, including those of no rank or different species—when desiring to receive the precepts, must first purify themselves, arouse the great vow, approach the master’s gate, and practice the Dao with reverence and devotion. If no master is available to transmit them, and one seeks to attain all virtues, one should receive and recite them before the seat of the Three Treasures, saying:

What is meant by attaining the sight of goodness? It is when, in the place of practicing the Dao with reverence and devotion, the eyes perceive divine light, shining brightly like the sun, initially small but later vast, illuminating the three realms. Heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, are without obstruction, and even all boundless wondrous causes—this is called the radiant and pure sign of the precepts. If it is not thus, it is not the cause of attaining the precepts. If one encounters a great and virtuous master, this is called a blessed meeting of past karmic conditions, and no other signs need be seen.

Now, I tell you all: to encounter the cause of the precepts is as rare as meeting in a vast kalpa. At this juncture, you must arouse the mind of aspiration and together generate wholesome thoughts."

At that time, the Celestial Worthy spoke these verses:

"With a mind of equanimity,
I expound these true and wondrous precepts,
Wishing all beings
To dwell in peace within the Dao’s sanctuary.
Celestial dragons, demons, ghosts, and spirits,
Yakshas, non-humans, and others—
All those of superior faculties who can speak,
May universally receive and uphold them."

Those who receive the precepts
shall enter the rank of true sages.
Whether celestial or mundane, saint or sage,
all should revere them with reverence.
On the new and full moons,
ascend the lion thrones.
With settled mind and regulated qi,
harmoniously expound these precepts.
All who hear the Dharma-sound
shall listen in silent stillness.
Those who do not recite for themselves
enter the hall of blessings through faith.

Now, at this auspicious hour,
I proclaim these wondrous precepts for you.
Having received the precepts,
you must further propagate and make them known.
Whenever one desires to receive the precepts,
or to read, uphold, or recite them,
first take refuge in the Three Treasures,
then proclaim the precept-text.
Those who uphold and recite according to the Dharma
shall gain seven worldly blessings in this life.
You must firmly believe,
without doubt or hesitation.

First, those of short lifespan
shall have their years extended.
Second, those of dull nature
shall open their minds to vastness.
Third, those of lowly form
shall gradually attain noble bearing.
Fourth, the impoverished
shall soon become prosperous.
Fifth, the unsightly
shall gain comeliness.
Sixth, inner and outer illnesses
shall daily be dispelled and healed.
Seventh, those beset by afflictions
shall swiftly attain great peace.

Know that those who receive the precepts
shall gain such blessings and virtue.
The supreme good cause of the future
shall endure for kalpas without end.
Ascending through the twenty-seven stages,
they shall attain the supreme Dao.
As the heart’s desires are fulfilled,
the Heavenly Worthy is revealed.

After the Heavenly Worthy spoke these verses, he addressed the four assemblies: "Those who wish to hear the true precepts of the Great Dao’s dharma-sound must be upright in body and mind, with the three karmas purified. Listen carefully, receive with reverence, and uphold them in accordance with the Dao.

All who receive and uphold the precepts must take refuge in the Three Treasures, share a single sincere aspiration, and harbor no divergent thoughts. Take refuge in the Dao, the scriptures, and the masters—the Three Treasures.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Disciples who receive the true precepts must not engage in the butcher’s trade or killing, nor take their own lives, instruct others to kill, facilitate killing, rejoice in killing, or even kill due to circumstances, necessity, retaliation, or error—all such forms of killing are forbidden. Regard all sentient beings as you would your own life.

Those who kill incur six karmic retributions:
First, in this life, they shall meet with misfortune and constant adversity.
Second, they shall be hated by all beings as enemies.
Third, they shall suffer harm from ghosts and spirits, inviting calamities.
Fourth, as their primary retribution, they shall fall into hell upon death, enduring the torments of sword trees and blade mountains without respite.
Fifth, as secondary retribution, they shall be reborn as beasts, devouring one another.
Sixth, even if they regain human form, they shall suffer execution.
This is a grave evil, not the conduct of a true person.
Let the evil karma of killing be extinguished.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Disciples who receive the true precepts must not steal or take wealth that is not rightfully theirs. Even lost items found on the road, carried by wind or birds, or discovered in the wild must not be taken. Nor may one kill to seize property, use force or coercion, employ deceit or inducement, or take even the smallest fraction—all such acts are forbidden.

Those who steal incur five karmic retributions:
First, they shall be reduced to begging or servitude, living in poverty and lowliness.
Second, their endeavors shall fail, their possessions wasted by water, fire, or vermin.
Third, they shall constantly suffer from slander and the loss of wealth.
Fourth, as their primary retribution, they shall be cast into the hell of universal plunder, enduring unbearable torment.
Fifth, as secondary retribution, they shall be reborn as oxen or horses.
This is a grave evil, not the conduct of a true person.
Let the evil karma of stealing be extinguished.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Disciples who receive the true precepts must not engage in illicit lust, improper unions between men and women, or defilement that disrupts the purity of the ordained. They must not violate chastity, disregard age, or make distinctions of kinship or appearance—all such acts are forbidden.

Those who commit sexual misconduct incur seven karmic retributions:
First, it is the root of birth and death.
Second, it is the source of defilement and affliction.
Third, it obstructs the cultivation of virtue.
Fourth, it shortens life and scatters the soul.
Fifth, it inverts waking and dreaming, confusing the mind.
Sixth, upon death, they shall fall into hell, enduring the torments of iron beds and copper pillars, their bodies scorched and bones shattered. They shall sink into freezing pools, pierced by ice and frost, dying and reviving in an endless cycle of suffering.
Seventh, as secondary retribution, they shall be reborn as swine, dogs, or other impure beasts.
This is a grave evil, not the conduct of a true person.
Let the evil karma of lust be extinguished.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Disciples who receive the true precepts must not lie or slander, defame the Three Treasures, emperors, masters, or teachers—whether ordained or lay, upholders or violators of the Dao. All should be revered and honored in accordance with the Dao. Even in matters of differing teachings or shared goodness, one must not provoke disputes.

Those who slander incur six karmic retributions:
First, in this life, they shall suffer from severe illness.
Second, in future lives, they shall dwell in darkness without understanding.
Third, for a hundred kalpas, they shall be reborn as blind insects.
Fourth, though born human, they shall lack tongues.
Fifth, they shall be mired in enmity, unloved and disrespected.
Sixth, life after life, they shall have no affinity with goodness, their words distrusted and themselves shunned.
This is a grave evil, not the conduct of a true person.
Let the evil karma of slander be extinguished.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Disciples who receive the true precepts must not engage in divisive speech, harsh curses, or venomous words that harm sentient beings, stir up conflict, or sow discord. Even ghosts, spirits, and ordinary beings find such speech unbearable—how much more so the noble and wise.

Those who speak maliciously incur six karmic retributions:
First, in this life, they shall constantly suffer humiliation.

Fifth, in all their endeavors, they shall never find satisfaction.
Sixth, as retribution, they shall be reborn as swine, dogs, wasps, scorpions, venomous creatures, two-headed snakes, or nine-headed birds.
This is a grave evil, not the conduct of a true person.
Let the evil karma of malicious speech be extinguished.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Disciples who receive the true precepts must not envy those superior to themselves, suppress the worthy and wise, or, lacking virtue, slander others out of malice. They must not scheme to harm or destroy others. Those who harbor such thoughts damage their own fields of merit—how can they hope to attain good fruit in the end?

Those who envy incur five karmic retributions:
First, they shall never encounter the Three Treasures or the noble and wise.
Second, they shall sever all good affinities and be bound by misfortune.
Third, as their primary retribution, they shall be reborn deaf and blind.
Fourth, they shall often face peril and bring about their own destruction.
Fifth, they shall be tormented by evil affinities without respite.
This is a grave evil, not the conduct of a true person.
Let the evil karma of envy be extinguished.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Disciples who receive the true precepts must not be stingy or greedy, harming others for personal gain. When they see beings insatiable in desire, they should gently instruct them to cultivate contentment, for the craving for wealth is like drinking saltwater or filling a leaking vessel—it can never be satisfied.

Those who are stingy and greedy incur four karmic retributions:
First, in this life, they shall gain much but lose much."

Second, in their next life, they shall suffer lowly status, hunger, and cold.
Third, they shall take the form of hungry ghosts, swallowing fire and eating coals.
Fourth, they shall fall into the retribution of jackals, wolves, birds, insects, and other beasts.
This is a grave evil, not the conduct of a true person.
Let the evil karma of stinginess and greed be extinguished.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Disciples who receive the true precepts must not indulge in wrath, utter harsh or venomous words, or act with cruelty and violence.
Those who give rein to wrath incur four karmic retributions:
First, they shall deplete their spirit and qi, harmed by their own poisonous force.
Second, sentient beings shall find their sight and sound displeasing.
Third, in death, they shall become poisonous birds, wasps, snakes, or other vicious beasts.
Fourth, even if reborn among humans, they shall be base, foolish, and lowly, despised by all things and devoid of dignity.
This is a grave evil, not the conduct of a true person.
Let the evil karma of wrath be extinguished.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Disciples who receive the true precepts must not indulge in ignorance and folly, acting with obstinacy and perversity, deceiving the worthy and good, and refusing to heed instruction.
Those who are foolish and perverse incur four karmic retributions:
First, the spirits shall not protect them.
Second, they shall sever their roots of goodness.
Third, they shall lose the right and enter the crooked.
Fourth, they shall be plagued by demonic forces.
This is a grave evil, not the conduct of a true person.
Let the evil karma of folly be extinguished.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Disciples who receive the true precepts must not betray their king, harbor disloyal and unrighteous thoughts, raise armies, or harm the innocent.
Those who are disloyal incur six karmic retributions:
First, they shall suffer in their own bodies.
Second, they shall bring ruin upon their families.
Third, after death, they shall dwell in the Three Wretched Realms for kalpas without escape.
Fourth, they shall be reborn with the bodies of venomous snakes or vicious beasts.
Fifth, even if they return to the human realm, their residual retribution shall be mutilation and slaughter.
Sixth, they shall always be born in evil places, without freedom or ease.
This is a grave evil, not the conduct of a true person.
Let the evil karma of disloyalty be extinguished.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Disciples who receive the true precepts must not lack filial piety, defy their parents, fail to show reverence and love, distance themselves from their kin, forget kindness and grace, or fail to feel shame and remorse.
Those who are unfilial incur six karmic retributions:
First, they shall be punished by the king’s law.
Second, they shall be despised and abandoned by all beings.
Third, they shall fall into hell, where the ten sufferings shall be inflicted upon them.
Fourth, they shall take the forms of owls and other creatures that harm one another.
Fifth, even if reborn among humans, the karmic cause of their unfilial conduct shall manifest as sons and daughters who torment one another.
Sixth, they shall be struck down by heavenly thunderbolts from all directions.
This is a grave evil, not the conduct of a true person.
Let the evil karma of unfiliality be extinguished.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Disciples who receive the true precepts must not consume alcohol or meat, nor encourage others to do so.
Those who drink alcohol incur three karmic retributions:
First, in this life, they shall obstruct and lose their good dharmas, and in the future, their consciousness shall become dull and dim.
Second, they shall become deranged and confused, lacking discernment, and shall often be reborn as bats, toads, or similar creatures.
Third, even if they attain a human rebirth, their nature shall be deluded and foolish, bearing the retribution of ignorance.
Those who eat meat incur two karmic retributions:
First, they shall fail to practice good dharmas, sever the seed of compassion, and wherever they go, they shall constantly repay karmic debts to beings, becoming their enemies.
Second, their families shall scatter, filled with sorrow and little joy, and after death, they shall fall into the hell of hungry ghosts or take the forms of jackals and wolves.
This is a grave evil, not the conduct of a true person.
Let the evil karma of drinking alcohol and eating meat be extinguished.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The twelve great evil karmas listed above must swiftly be reflected upon and earnestly repented. If one does not repent, after the body perishes, they shall be flayed by the wind-knives of hell, forever sinking into evil destinies, lifetime after lifetime, without affinity for the Dao. Even insentient beings with awareness shall find their presence displeasing, let alone those of true wisdom and compassionate hearts who endure such suffering.

After expounding these precepts, the Heavenly Worthy proclaimed: Disciples who receive the true precepts must next make great vows, so that the roots of their precepts may become as firm as the Dark Capital Mountain, their precept-forms as majestic as the Jade Capital Palace, and the power of their precept-virtue as radiant as a vaidūrya jewel.

The gods and humans together chanted this gāthā:
We bow our heads to the Lord of the Three Realms,
We take refuge in the Worthy of the Ten Thousand Ways.
May the true and wondrous precepts be bestowed,
To liberate gods and humans.
Those who can arouse even a single good thought,
With sincere hearts unwavering,
Shall ever be protected by mighty power,
And together enter the Forest of Seven Treasures.
