At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning resided in the Three Yuan Palace of the Ninefold Pure Wondrous Realm, seated upon a precious cloud-throne adorned with the blossoms of the Three Qi beneath the canopy of the *qianlin* trees. Together with the assembly of great sages—the Most High Dao Lords, the Most High Lord Lao, the Nine August Perfected Sovereigns, the Flying Celestial Great Saints, the Wondrous Conduct Perfected Ones, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, the gods and dragons, spirits and ghosts—an innumerable host gathered as one upon the jeweled terrace of *jieren*.

From the ten directions, the assembled multitudes arrived in five-colored jade chariots, eight-scene jade carriages, dark numinous green standards, flying cloud-white canopies, unicorn-drawn feathered chariots, dragon banners and phoenix plumes, lions and white cranes. Their harmonious chants filled the air as they burned incense, scattered flowers, soared through the void, recited the cavernous scriptures, and extolled the Celestial Worthy. Together, they reviewed the registers and talismans, delivering all beings from suffering.

Then, the radiance of the Upper Palace of the Three Yuan illuminated the vast expanse, piercing the Great Void. The Purple Tenuity of the Numinous Capital shone upon the ten directions, extending even to the boundless realms and the eternal night of the Nine Dark Hells. Within that light, the roots of karmic destinies—both good and evil—were revealed in clarity. Every dark bureau was bathed in luminance, and every celestial palace became visible.

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, together with the great assembly, expounded the most wondrous teachings, enlightening humans and gods, marking meritorious deeds, and inscribing names upon the Yellow Register. Golden tablets and jade slips were arrayed before the Three Clarities, and every hell became visible in detail.

The Celestial Worthies of Salvation from the Ten Directions entered the Nine Dark Hells to deliver the suffering. They commanded the Northern Emperor, the Three Officials, the Nine Bureaus, the One Hundred Twenty Offices, the Five Emperor Examiners, the Life-Inspecting Lads, the Controllers of Life and Destiny, the Recorders of Merit and Execution, the Nine Mounds of the Earth Sovereign, the Four Luminous Lords and their attendants, the officials of the Five Marchmounts, the enforcing divine soldiers, the mighty celestial warriors, the heavenly couriers and armored troops, the Ox-Head jailers, the Mighty Sword Spirit Kings, the great demons of the Three Realms, and the nine hundred million ghost kings. All gathered within the Nine Dark Hells to receive the teachings and precepts.

At that time, the Northern Emperor of Fengdu and the host of ghostly officials trembled in awe. Each thought to themselves: *"We have accumulated sins and become ghostly officials, ruling over the netherworld, dwelling eternally in darkness. For kalpas uncounted, we have never seen the light. By what cause do we now suddenly behold the majestic radiance of the exalted sages illuminating the profound gloom? Though we wish to inquire, doubt and fear restrain us."*

At that moment, within the Universal Flogging Hell, the names of the sinful were inscribed in the Black Register. The Ox-Head jailers drove them onto the Mountain of Knives, where their bodies and heads were mangled, their limbs scattered. Yet among them, one man ascended and descended the mountain, following the trees’ heights, treading upon blades and edges without a single wound. All the swords and halberds transformed into lotus flowers.

Then, the Northern Emperor, greatly alarmed, prostrated himself in reverence and addressed the Celestial Worthy: *"Your disciple, by former causes, has unfortunately assumed office in the netherworld, dwelling in Fengdu for kalpas uncounted. I have repeatedly witnessed the suffering of sinners in various torments. I have also seen the Eastern Wind-Thunder Hell, where black winds, crashing thunder, and clashing lightning hurl flying spears and drifting halberds, piercing the sinners, scattering their limbs, and rending their five viscera. For ten thousand kalpas, they endure suffering without respite, day or night.*

*I have seen the Southern Fire-Screen Hell, where sinners swallow flames and devour coals, scorched by fire. Their heads and faces are charred, their crowns bear fire-mountains, and their skin, flesh, and bones blaze with flames. For ten thousand kalpas, they endure suffering without respite, day or night.*

*I have seen the Western Diamond Hell, where sinners are endlessly beaten with iron rods and golden hammers. Their limbs are mangled, their sinews and bones scattered. Iron forks pierce their bellies, and golden hammers lodge in their hearts. For ten thousand kalpas, they endure suffering without respite, day or night.*

*I have seen the Northern Dark-Cold Hell, where sinners sink into the freezing pools of Qiuhan. Ice spears and frost blades sever their sinews and bones, while a hundred poisons pour upon them. Their limbs scatter, and their hearts and bellies rupture. For ten thousand kalpas, they endure suffering without respite, day or night.*

*I have seen the Central Universal Flogging Hell, where sinners endure unbearable torment. Their sinews are severed, blood flows, and they collapse in agony. Then, the jailers impale them with iron forks, driving them to ascend the Mountain of Knives and the Forest of Swords. The winds from eight directions sway the trees, and as they tread upon the blades, their bodies are impaled upon the sword-edges. For ten thousand kalpas, they endure suffering without respite, day or night.*

*I have seen the Southeastern Copper-Pillar Hell, where sinners embrace and climb copper pillars engulfed in raging flames. Their bodies are scorched inside and out, their backs and bellies ooze pus. For ten thousand kalpas, they endure suffering without respite, day or night.*

*I have seen the Southwestern Butchering Hell, where sinners are hung upside down while blades carve their bodies. Their four limbs, sinews, skin, and five viscera are sliced apart. Blood flows across the ground, and the pain is unbearable. For ten thousand kalpas, they endure suffering without respite, day or night.*

*I have seen the Northwestern Fire-Chariot Hell, where sinners are torn apart by five chariots, their limbs scattered. Some are bound to fire-chariots, their bodies sliced by the whirling blades of the wheels in all four directions. Fierce flames roast and char them. For ten thousand kalpas, they endure suffering without respite, day or night."*

I have also witnessed the Northeastern Cauldron-Boiling Hell, where sinners are impaled upon iron forks and plunged into seething cauldrons. Their five limbs boil and dissolve, their four limbs fester and rot, pus and blood reek with unbearable stench. For ten thousand kalpas, they endure suffering without respite, day or night.

Yet how is it that these same sinners, when ascending the mountains of knives and forests of swords, remain wholly unharmed? The blades and spear-points transform into lotus blossoms, their forms becoming radiant and majestic, walking fearlessly amidst all torments, untouched by any suffering.

Suddenly, the Most High Saint turned His chariot, and celestial perfected beings descended in assembly. All trembled in awe, none knowing the cause.

I only pray that the Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion and mercy, will universally save and deliver all suffering beings in the Nine Dark Realms—eradicating their sins, awakening them to past lives, abandoning evil, and embracing goodness—so they may escape the Nine Dark Realms, dwell in light, cycle through blessed rewards, attain lasting liberation, and forever depart the Three Wretched Paths.

At that moment, the multitudes in the Nine Hells of the Underworld, hearing the Northern Emperor’s earnest plea, were moved to repentance. Yearning for absolution, they raised their voices in sorrowful cries, their lamentations resounding to the Brahma heavens.

Then the Heavenly Worthy of the Ten Directions, Savior from Suffering, gazed upon them with boundless compassion. His salvific radiance and the power of his sixfold wisdom enveloped all, commanding the sinners to close their eyes and meditate in stillness. In an instant, they recalled their past lives, each clearly remembering the evil deeds committed in their days of existence:

Some had murdered their sovereign or father, failing in filial piety to their parents; others had slandered the Great Dao, turning from truth to falsehood; some had harmed their brothers or betrayed their teachers; others had committed incest with kin or acted as bandits, taking lives; some had slaughtered beings to indulge themselves; others had bullied the weak or oppressed the lowly with their power; some had feigned devotion to the Three Treasures while their hearts remained divided; others had disdained Dharma masters or defiled sacred texts; some had harbored malice, cruelty, or envy; others had spread slander or stirred conflict among the virtuous; some had killed living beings, indulged in lust, or desecrated the four sacrifices and the three luminaries. Whether by thought, word, or deed—whether self-committed or taught to others—all sins accumulated over countless kalpas arose in their minds at once. Each clearly understood, their sorrow redoubling as they yearned for liberation.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the four assemblies: "Listen carefully, all of you. These sinners, for kalpas uncounted, have disbelieved the scriptures and teachings, persisting only in evil. Sin upon sin has bound them, their transgressions filling the measure of their fate. Thus their names were inscribed in the ledgers of evil, their bodies cast into the Nine Dark Realms, mired in the Three Wretched Paths. Yet they were not beyond deliverance, for among them was one who, in life, had established the Great Fast of the Nine Hells, received the Golden Register and White Petition of the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts, their name inscribed in golden script upon the Jade Clarity’s rolls. Their virtue profound and merit lofty, they moved the upper realms. By my divine power, I respond to their plea and now proclaim these precepts to sever all roots of evil, that all of you may be liberated at once."

Then the Northern Emperor, hearing these words, rejoiced immeasurably, his heart leaping with joy. Gazing upon the Heavenly Worthy’s countenance, he offered this hymn of praise:

"Excellent is the Primordial Beginning, Worthy of Honor,
Father and Mother of all beings.
From the Purple Tenuity Palace, Your light bends low,
Illuminating the gates of the Nine Dark Realms.
O towering halls of frost and desolation,
Your radiance melts the icy shores.
Where raging flames once burned,
Now the Dharma-rain pours forth in torrents.
Your boundless compassion and wisdom,
Ever skillful in relieving the suffering of multitudes,
Deliver the souls of the long night—
Now they bow in reverence before You."

When the Northern Emperor finished this hymn, the celestial hosts as one voice proclaimed its excellence. Celestial music of myriad kinds resounded, banners and canopies, incense and flowers, shading all beneath.

Then the Primordial Heavenly Worthy spoke again to the four assemblies: "Listen carefully, quiet your minds, and attend. I shall now reveal to you the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts of the Golden Register and White Petition—their merit in upholding them, their power to deliver from suffering, their divine efficacy beyond thought. All spirits bow in reverence and receive these teachings."

The Heavenly Worthy declared:
"First: Be diligent and loyal to your sovereign..."

Second: Honor and yield, filial in serving parents;
Third: Do not kill, but with compassion deliver all beings;
Fourth: Do not commit adultery, but rectify the body in its place among things;
Fifth: Do not steal, but extend righteousness and diminish the self;
Sixth: Do not harbor wrath, nor oppress others with fierce anger;
Seventh: Do not deceive, nor flatter and harm the good;
Eighth: Do not be arrogant, nor slight the Perfected and True;
Ninth: Do not waver, but uphold the precepts with single-minded devotion.

The Primordial Mandate of the Golden Register and White Petition—True Talisman for Deliverance from Suffering—is now proclaimed to the ten directions of the boundless worlds, to the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the One Hundred Twenty Courts, the Examiners of the Five Emperors, the Nine Dark Hells, the Mighty Heavenly Enforcers, the Divine Soldiers under command, the Recorders of Life and Destiny, the Ministers of Merit and Execution, the Ox-Headed Jailers, and the Great Demons of the Three Realms: deliver the departed soul of so-and-so from the hells, forever parting from the long night, beholding the light, all sins dissolved, enmities reconciled. By the merit of upholding these Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts, ascend to the heavens, all as proclaimed, transmitted by wind and fire.

In the year of the Great Year, such-and-such month, such-and-such day, proclaimed from the purification altar.

The Primordial Mandate of the Golden Register and White Petition—Talisman of Eternal Life—is now proclaimed to the Cinnabar Heaven of the Southern Realm, the Vermilion Fire Mansion, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Great Lord of Eternal Life, the Venerable Han and Sima, the Ministers of Life and Destiny, the Divine Lords of Prolonging Life and Augmenting Longevity, the Deliverers from Calamity, the Overseers of Resurrection and Rebirth: elevate the departed soul of so-and-so to the Vermilion Palace and the Flowing Fire Court, refine the jade pupils and temper the form, scour the body with yellow blossoms, inscribe the name in the Purple Register, and receive transformation and rebirth. By the merit of this Golden Register’s deliverance of life, ascend moment by moment, all as proclaimed, transmitted by wind and fire.

In the year of the Great Year, such-and-such month, such-and-such day, proclaimed from the purification altar.

If you can uphold the Golden Register and White Petition, the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts, the Talisman of Eternal Life, and the True Talisman for Deliverance from Suffering, you shall eradicate the great sins of the Nine Dark Hells, your name inscribed in the Nine Palaces. The Youthful Attendants of Life’s Record, the Guardian Spirits of the Precepts, the Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors, and the Clerks of the Six Palaces shall follow the text of the petition, shielding and protecting the disciple who receives the precepts.

The Heavenly Worthy further declared: If in a land where warfare does not cease and pestilence spreads, the sovereign, queen, crown prince, nobles, and all the people shall perform the Great Purification of the Nine Hells and each uphold the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts and the precious talismans of the Golden Register. Then warfare shall cease, evil omens withdraw, heaven and humanity rejoice, and the land attain great peace.

If in mountains and wilds, beset by tigers, wolves, and fierce beasts, calm the mind and visualize the Golden Petition, the Talisman of Life, the Youthful Attendants of Life’s Record, the precept-master, and the guardian deities. The beasts shall retreat of themselves and never harm you.

If upon the great sea, encountering fierce winds, likewise visualize, and the winds and waves shall calm, allowing you to reach the shore.

If amid the blades of battle, likewise visualize, and weapons shall vanish, sparing you from harm.

If in prison, bound in shackles, likewise visualize, and grievances shall be redressed, ensuring your release.

If afflicted by malevolent spirits, ghosts, bandits, or manifold sufferings, likewise visualize, and the demonic shall vanish, bringing natural recovery.

If one’s life has ended and they are bound for the Nine Dark Hells, their name inscribed in the Black Register, their spouse, children, disciples, and fellow students shall establish the Great Purification of the Nine Hells, inscribe the name on the White Petition, and receive the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts. The Black Register shall be burned away, and those sinners shall be instantly delivered, their souls ascending to the Nine Heavens. Through the turning of karmic conditions, they shall become Perfected of the Nine Palaces.

The Heavenly Worthy further declared: The Wondrous Precepts of the Golden Register and the Talisman of Eternal Life bear the gravest prohibitions. If cultivated according to the method, their blessings are boundless.

If one harbors thoughts of slander, fostering contempt, know that such a person accumulates evil for ten thousand kalpas, their karmic obstructions profound. Their name inscribed in the Register of Evil, their body claimed by demonic officials, after death they shall inevitably sink into the Nine Dark Hells, enduring every torment, bound in the long night without release.

Even if one initially believes and receives these teachings but later grows arrogant, the Youthful Attendants of Life’s Record shall report to the Three Offices, erase their name from the Golden Petition, and inscribe it in the Register of Death. In this life, they may suffer from malignant diseases—festering sores, ulcers, leprosy—abandoned by all, unable to live yet unable to die, tormented by their own anguish without escape. Or they may long endure misfortunes: falling afoul of the law, perishing by blade or warfare, mauled by tigers or wolves, drowned in water or burned by fire, cursed by malevolent tongues, discord in the household, strife among kin, entanglement with enemies. Once losing the true Dao, they shall forever sink into evil destinies.

Therefore, follow the regulations and uphold these teachings without deviant thoughts. Proclaim them to all men and women, that all may hear and know.

Then the Northern Emperor and the four assemblies, along with the sinners of the Nine Hells, having heard these words, awakened in understanding, each generating good thoughts. Their manifold sufferings dissolved, body and mind at peace, they all aroused the Dao-mind, their nature unwavering.

At that moment, the Black Registers of the Nine Hells were all consumed in flames. The Fire Mountains stilled their flames, the Ice Pools calmed their waves. Those who swallowed fire and ate coals were transformed into sweet dew. Golden hammers and iron staves became lotus blossoms.

Flying through the void, they intoned this hymn:

We bow to the supreme Dao,
Our hearts return to the Primordial Worthy.
Perfect and wondrous, Lord of Response,
Opening the gates of soaring mystery.

The wondrous precepts gladden the Five Spirits,
The golden script admonishes the myriad gods.
The Youthful Attendants record the registers,
The talismans deliver suffering souls.

Riding clouds to the Jade Emperor’s court,
In harmony with the immortals of the mysterious realm.
