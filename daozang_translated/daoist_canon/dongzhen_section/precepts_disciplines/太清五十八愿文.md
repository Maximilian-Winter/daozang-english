This is the *Essential Precepts of Exhortation from the Supreme Wisdom*, all spoken in the upper scroll of the *Great Wisdom Sutra*. The Dharma was transmitted by the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, to govern the practice of the Dao. Those with karmic fortune may encounter this text; keep it secret and uphold it. To recklessly show it to the faithless brings misfortune in this life, death as a lowly ghost, confinement in hell, cycling through the five sufferings, and rebirth losing the human path. Those who slander the scriptures and precepts meet the same fate.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: Among evil deeds, none are greater than jealousy, killing, greed, extravagance, arrogance, and lust. If even one of these dwells in the heart, it will surely cut short your years. To cling to these while seeking immortality—is this not lamentable?

When Daoists fast, burn incense, and recite scriptures in purity, it is the world’s greatest flourishing, yet some do not wish to see it, or see it as if not seeing.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: The world is deluded, turning away from immortals to compete in serving ghosts and spirits, even killing life to seek life—how far they stray from true life! While alive, they do not cultivate goodness or govern the body, enduring the cutting of desires; only in death do they lavishly bury their bones, unaware that their souls and five poisons are imprisoned in hell, suffering in the three wretched realms, cycling through the five paths. Life in the world is brief, yet they amass wealth without end, burdening themselves, until blessings are exhausted and retribution arrives, their bodies perishing, names vanishing, wealth scattering like dust in the wind.

The Perfected said: To learn the Dao for others, first be filial to parents, loyal to rulers, compassionate to subordinates, truthful to friends, reliable and consistent, admonishing evil and praising good, without partiality or selfishness, not violating external teachings—thus mastering the human Dao. Next, abstain from wine, music, lust, jealousy, killing, extravagance, greed, arrogance, and laziness. Then, avoid the five pungent foods, fatty meats, and rich flavors. Next, contemplate the unseen, the mind beholding purity and emptiness. Then, practice grain avoidance, uphold the great precepts, be steadfast and diligent, practice embryonic breathing, ingest and harmonize fluids, and cultivate merit. The Perfected said: Endure what others cannot endure, cut what others cannot cut, do what others cannot do, dwell where others cannot dwell, wear what others cannot wear, eat what others cannot eat, keep what others cannot keep, learn what others cannot learn. Then, stabilize with elixirs, feast on cloud sprouts, corpse worms sink away, filth and leakage vanish, the six palaces are cleansed, the five viscera are at peace.

To fast for long, meditate deeply, chant the *Cavern Scriptures*, savor their wondrous flavors, and refine the elixir—if the heart can be thus, how could one not attain the Dao of ascending immortality?

The Perfected said: If one does not cultivate the human Dao toward rulers and parents, does not cease indulgence in wine and lust, killing, greed, arrogance, and self-indulgence, deceiving and misleading the worthy, borrowing without repayment, never content with what one has—if such conduct persists, the heart remaining unyielding, yet hoping to embrace fasting, precepts, and the Dao, aspiring to bodily flight—is this not lamentable? Such people will long dwell in hell, treading the five poisons, climbing mountains of knives and forests of swords, scorched by boiling water and fire, their bodies boiled, longing for death yet unable to die.

Hungry, they eat iron; thirsty, they drink fire. Exposed to freezing ice, their flesh is cut to the bone. Only then are they handed over to the Three Officials, banished to the sea, made to shoulder earth and stone, whipped and interrogated under torture. They endure the three paths and five destinies, shuttling through the ten sufferings and eight hardships. Their anguish is measureless, beyond all description.

The Perfected said: Such people are not even equal to those worldly worthies who observe the human Dao, revere and believe in the Daoist scriptures, and follow only what is good. Subject to the transformations of life and death, they wander through the changes of time, yet roam freely within the realm, serene and at ease. When their lives end, they enter the halls of blessing, spared the prisons of suffering. Some become spirits; later, reborn in the human realm, they do not lose their original vow, but deepen their roots of faith, form bonds with the worthy and sagely, and day by day shed their defilements, until at last they enter the immortal Dao.
