The Venerable Celestial Worthy declares: Those who leave the household and transcend the mundane do so by virtue of profound karmic affinity from past lives, enabling them to rise above the common lot. If they remain steadfast from beginning to end, refining themselves with utmost dedication, their blessings shall extend to seven generations, and felicity shall flow through their entire family.

As the saying goes: "A nine-tiered terrace begins with heaped earth; a thousand-mile journey starts with a single step." The gateway to the Dao and the foundation of accumulated virtue must likewise begin here. At the time of deliverance, one should receive the Ten Precepts for Initial Realization—you shall accept them.

**The First Precept:** One must not be disloyal, unfilial, unkind, or untrustworthy. Instead, fulfill your duty to sovereign and kin, and extend sincerity to all beings.

As the tradition states: "Of the ten thousand scrolls of immortals’ scriptures, loyalty and filial piety come first." Devoting oneself to serving the ruler and diligently attending to the sovereign’s affairs repays the grace of shelter and protection. Cultivating conduct and acting with caution, serving parents with goodness, repays the grace of birth and nurture. Serving one’s master as one serves one’s parents repays the grace of instruction. All people are born under three bonds—serving them as one repays the greatest debt of origin. Moreover, looking up, one feels no shame before Heaven; looking down, one feels no remorse before others. Revering and trusting the divine spirits repays the grace of creation. Together with the three preceding matters, these are called the **Four Graces**.

As for praying for the nation’s prosperity, dispelling demons and averting harm, transforming the people toward goodness, and supplementing where royal transformation does not reach—this is the loyalty of one who has left the household. In life, guide your kin to cherish blessings and turn toward the Dao; in death, assist them in ascending to the blessed realms. In your own conduct, sever all attachments to affection, quiet all worldly entanglements, focus the mind single-pointedly, and devote yourself to studying the Dao. Once the merit of the Dao is accomplished, even if your karmic bonds with kin span countless kalpas, all may be delivered. Above, this repays the **Fourfold Grace**; below, it relieves the suffering of the **Three Wretched Realms**—this is the filial piety of one who has left the household.

As for the unkind: they deceive themselves with reckless actions, transgressing rites and committing wrongs. As for the untrustworthy: they boast with empty exaggerations and bewilder the multitude with flowery words.

One must recognize that great loyalty means never deceiving one’s own heart, not even in the smallest matter; great filial piety means never acting contrary to principle, extending love to all beings as to one’s own body. Thus, a single deceitful word betrays loyalty; a single act against propriety violates filial piety. Loyalty and filial piety stand as the foremost of all precepts, the source of all conduct, and the primary duty of the seeker. If one can uphold and practice these as described above, one may fully serve ruler and kin, and extend sincerity to all things.

The second precept: one must not secretly scheme to harm others for personal gain. Instead, one should practice hidden virtue and broadly aid all beings. Secret scheming refers to instigating others to wrongdoing, inciting lawsuits, leading people into traps or legal snares while deriving pleasure from it—such harm for self-benefit is beyond measure. If, instead, one reflects inwardly and turns others toward goodness, one accumulates hidden virtue and universally aids all beings. This is the foremost principle of entering the Dao.

The third precept: one must not kill living beings to satisfy taste, but should practice kindness and compassion, extending it even to insects. Refraining from killing preserves benevolence. Birds and beasts share the same nature and life as humans: they form couples, have parent-child bonds, dwell in nests, seek food, and experience love, sorrow, joy, and fear—how are they different from us? To harbor a merciful heart, refusing to kill or consume them, and thus embody compassion—is this not virtuous? If one’s heart cherishes all beings but circumstances require blending with the world, one may observe the threefold purity: not intending to kill, not personally killing, and not witnessing the killing. In this way, one eats according to conditions—where is the killing in that?

Moreover, sages and worthies have never rigidly prescribed meat-eating or abstention; their benevolence extends to all beings without distinction. Like a net with three sides left open, they distance themselves from the kitchen, fish with a hook but not a net, shoot birds but not roosting ones, avoid killing hibernating creatures, and refrain from breaking growing plants. Their virtue and kindness extend equally to humans, insects, and plants. Can those who abstain from meat truly live up to this? One should also recognize that the abundance or scarcity of one’s clothing and food results from the depth of past cultivation. What one receives today is one’s allotted portion; by moderating consumption, future blessings will grow immeasurably. If one acts thus, kindness extended to insects is no empty word.

The fourth precept: one must not engage in licentiousness, corrupting one’s true nature, defiling and profaning the sacred qi. Instead, one should guard one’s true integrity, ensuring no breach or transgression. Refraining from licentiousness prevents the disruption of ethical order. Marriage exists to continue the lineage and honor ancestors, so engagements are arranged through matchmakers, betrothal letters, and proper ceremonies, with feasts inviting neighbors and friends to reinforce distinctions between men and women. Thus, the way of husband and wife follows ritual propriety, avoiding encroachment on others—where is the licentiousness in this?

Prostitutes are deemed lowly precisely because their conduct disrupts human relationships. To associate with them is to descend to their level. Some past immortals visited brothels, either to test and strengthen their resolve against temptation or to guide those with karmic affinity toward awakening. Later, ordinary people may cite this to justify their own behavior, but such indulgence is mere heterodox wandering—true and false differ, as do immortals and mortals. Upright individuals naturally govern themselves and are not ensnared by such delusions.

Those who leave the household to transcend the mundane do so due to past good fortune, enabling them to rise above ordinary ties. If they can swiftly sever worldly attachments, cut off desire, and diligently cultivate the Dao, they may attain immortality, bringing blessings to nine generations and prosperity to their entire family. As the scriptures say: "Immortals and Daoists, though not inherently divine, accumulate essence and nurture qi to attain realization." However, if one’s foundation is weak and resolve unclear, one should early reflect and reform to encourage future progress, lest one squander good causes and fall back into the dust. By guarding true integrity without breach, one’s virtue and merit will daily renew, and Daoist attainment will be achieved.

The fifth precept: one must not undermine others’ success or sever others’ familial bonds. Instead, one should assist all beings with the Dao, fostering harmony among the nine relations. Not undermining others’ success means praising and supporting their virtues while concealing their faults, enabling them to succeed without losing virtue. Not severing others’ bonds means that when seeing discord among relatives—parents and children, husbands and wives, siblings, teachers and friends—one should use the Dao to exhort and reconcile them, preventing estrangement. Thus, human relationships remain intact, and both Dao and righteousness are preserved. This is the essential path of true cultivation; those who study the Dao should take heed.

The sixth precept: one must not slander the worthy, flaunt one’s own talents, or boast of one’s abilities. Instead, one should praise others’ virtues and not claim credit for one’s own merits. Sincerity is the gateway to the Dao. Speech is the voice of the heart; deceitful words arise from insincerity. To seek the Dao with an insincere heart is to turn away from it—this is impossible. Slandering the worthy, flaunting talents, and boasting of abilities are unbecoming of a true cultivator. One should praise others’ virtues, thereby completing one’s own merit and conduct. This is a profound precept for seekers.

The seventh precept: one must not overindulge in alcohol, consume forbidden meats, or disrupt the harmony of qi and nature. Instead, one should regulate temperament and focus on purity and emptiness. Refraining from alcohol prevents the disturbance of one’s nature.

For wine was originally used to conduct rituals, fostering harmony and the smooth flow of qi. The ancients, when hosting guests, would exchange a hundred bows in a day without ever becoming drunk, demonstrating moderation. Later generations, however, indulged their desires without restraint, drinking to excess in pursuit of intoxication. This led to the inversion of body and mind, the loss of ritual propriety, and sometimes illness or disaster—yet they remained oblivious to their errors. If one were to drink in moderation, adjusting intake according to one’s usual tolerance without exceeding it, how could it disturb one’s nature?

As for consuming forbidden meats: the ox labors for humanity, the dog demonstrates loyalty, the wild goose maintains order, and the carp and eel face the Dipper in reverence. How could one bear to eat such creatures? Extending this compassion to abstain from all such meats harmonizes one’s qi and nature, moves the true spirits, and dedicates one wholly to purity and emptiness. Thus, one’s Dao and practice renew daily, and profound merit manifests in due time. All learners must be vigilant in this.

The eighth precept: one must not indulge in insatiable greed, hoarding wealth without distribution. Instead, one should practice frugality and relieve the poor. A person’s poverty or wealth is ordained at the moment of birth, predetermined by fate. If one’s allotment of wealth is destined, it will return even after being spent; if one’s bones were formed in poverty, no amount of seeking will bring riches. Understanding this principle, one should leave all acquisition to nature. Wealth not one’s own must not be taken wrongfully; ill-gotten gains must not be seized; rightful gains should be taken in accordance with one’s portion. One must not fall into the desire for endless acquisition, nor hoard without sharing, lest misfortune be invited. Yet those of our fellowship must first see through the illusory and transient, relieving the poor with compassion, guarding frugality, and living in accord with conditions. Do not impose rigid demands, but keep the mind empty and at ease, letting worldly desires dissipate. Over time, one will naturally unite with the Dao in truth.

The ninth precept: one must not associate with the unworthy or dwell in impurity. Instead, one should emulate those superior to oneself and gather in purity and emptiness. When first leaving the household life, one cannot stand alone and must rely on the monastic community or form bonds with fellow cultivators, supporting one another to avoid imbalance. Yet companions are of three kinds: cloud-and-mist friends, good and wise friends, and reckless and strange friends.

Those who uphold integrity, refine the heart-ground, investigate karma, sever worldly attachments, and wander beyond the dust—seeking like-minded companions—are called cloud-and-mist friends. Their hearts resemble clouds and mist, untouched by worldly affairs. Others study scriptures and engage in lofty discourse; these are called good and wise friends, for though they do not refine the heart, neither do they commit evil. Then there are those who neglect the heart-ground, do not study the classics, disregard karma, speak perversely, act wildly, and provoke conflict over the slightest offense. They boast of strength, flaunt superiority, bully the good, and form cliques—these are reckless and strange friends.

After these three kinds of people depart this life, each is placed according to their deeds and receives their due recompense. The cloud-and-mist friends ascend into the formless, roaming and feasting in the Jade Capital, becoming immortals or celestial officials. The good and wise friends, their worldly hearts not yet exhausted, remain within the human realm. The reckless and strange friends, having received abundant offerings yet performed no merit, must repay their debts: some fall into Fengdu, others into the realm of beasts, cycling through suffering and affliction. When such a fate befalls them, how can regret avail? Of these three kinds of companions, one must choose wisely. Let learners reflect and seek what is most advantageous, emulating those superior to themselves and gathering in purity and emptiness. Thus, they will not betray the intentions of parents who sent them forth from the household, nor fail the sagely dynasty’s purpose in establishing teachings to deliver beings. Let all take this to heart, that they may attain the square and upright merit.

The tenth precept: one must not treat speech and laughter lightly or act insincerely. Instead, one should maintain gravity, speak sparingly, and devote oneself to the Dao and virtue. As the ancients said: “Those who are dignified and solemn, if not wealthy, will be noble; those who are frivolous and base, if not short-lived, will be poor.” Light and careless speech, obsequious smiles, and bending one’s learning to flatter the world—these are the refuge of petty persons, not the conduct of true cultivators. Moreover, gravity and restraint in speech, with every movement conforming to propriety, are essential for advancing on the Dao and the proper path for those who have attained understanding. If one can steadfastly uphold and practice this, what worry is there that lofty attainment will not be reached?

Here ends the *Ten Precepts for Initial Realization* of the Most High Lord of the Void.
