# 太上洞真智慧上品大诫

*The Supreme Cavern of Realized Wisdom’s Highest Precepts*
**Sutra Title:** *The Supreme Cavern of Realized Wisdom’s Highest Precepts*
Composed by an unknown author, approximately dated to the Eastern Jin dynasty. One of the ancient *Scriptures of Numinous Treasure* (*Lingbao Jing*). One scroll.

In the first year of the Kaihuang era, on the first day of the seventh month at the hour of noon, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning bestowed upon the Most High Lord of the Dao the *Highest Precepts of Realized Wisdom* within the Long Mulberry Grove of the Floating Mountain of Yucha in the Western Land of Yuna. At that moment, the Lord of the Dao, having received the precepts, prostrated himself facing north, his entire body touching the earth, his heart turning toward the ten directions before returning to bow toward the east.

The Celestial Worthy addressed the Most High Lord of the Dao, saying: "Today I shall proclaim the Dharma-sound, awakening those born in drought, delivering all men and women from calamity and affliction, entreating blessings and liberating lives, and uprooting the roots of all suffering. Let the living behold the Dao, their bodies freed from the eight difficulties; let the dead rejoice, feasting in the heavens, soon reborn among men as Wheel-Turning Sage Kings. Those who fast and seek the Dao must single-mindedly receive and uphold these ten precepts, earnestly accepting them without forgetfulness, contemplating them in silent focus, and reflecting upon the spontaneous. Let no stray thoughts disturb body and spirit. Those who can do so shall listen in stillness."

The Celestial Worthy declared:
1. **The First Precept:** Let the heart harbor no malice or envy. Give rise to no yin thieves. Guard the mouth and be cautious of transgressions. Let thoughts dwell in the Dharma.
2. **The Second Precept:** Uphold benevolence and refrain from killing. Pity and succor all beings. Let compassion and love extend broadly to rescue all.
3. **The Third Precept:** Maintain chastity and yield to others. Neither lust nor steal. Constantly cultivate good thoughts, diminishing the self to aid others.
4. **The Fourth Precept:** Neither indulge in sensuality nor desire. Let the heart be free from dissipation. Uphold purity and caution, ensuring conduct remains unstained.
5. **The Fifth Precept:** Let the mouth utter no evil words. Speech should not be ornate or deceitful. Be upright within and without, committing no transgressions of the mouth.
6. **The Sixth Precept:** Reduce wine and regulate conduct. Harmonize qi and temperament. Let the spirit remain unharmed, avoiding all evils.
7. **The Seventh Precept:** Do not envy those who surpass you or contend for fame and merit. In all matters, yield and withdraw, delivering others.
8. **The Eighth Precept:** Do not criticize or slander scriptures and sacred texts. Receive the Dharma with your whole heart, ever as though facing the divine.
9. **The Ninth Precept:** Do not engage in quarrels or disputes, nor judge the four classes of beings. Let neither gods nor men bear resentment, nor harm the spirit and qi.
10. **The Tenth Precept:** In all actions and deeds, maintain equanimity and single-mindedness. Let harmony prevail among people and reverence among spirits, ever thus in conduct.

The Celestial Worthy said: "Those who cultivate and uphold these precepts align with the heart of Heaven. Constantly practice great compassion, vowing to act for the sake of all, universally delivering the world from peril. Be humble and reverent toward the teachings, never growing lax. Better to die upholding goodness than to live in evil. Through unwavering devotion, one may be delivered from the five destinies, avoid the three evils, be protected by all heavens, and revered by the myriad spirits. Through fasting and upholding the precepts, one naturally attains liberation in this world."

The Most High Lord of the Dao, overcome with joy and awe, bowed his head in reverence and received the command.

The Celestial Worthy said: "For those who study, fast, and practice the Dao, delivering gods and humans and performing all virtuous deeds, there are twelve principles to follow in order to attain liberation in this world. You should adhere to them, thereby attaining true perfection and ultimately entering the realm of non-action, with all aspirations fulfilled.

1. Upon encountering true scriptures that reveal the Dharma and deliver all beings, one should awaken the Dao-mind, vowing that in future lives one may ascend to great sageliness.
2. Constantly practice a heart of compassion, vowing that all beings may universally hear and see, with deliverance extending broadly and without obstruction.
3. Delight in the scriptural teachings, deeply and extensively studying them. Let the will be firm and bright, awakening the ignorant and benighted.
4. Reverently receive the master’s instructions, broadly exhorting and transforming others, guiding them into the Dharma-enclosure and far from blind paths.
5. Trust in and turn toward the mysterious and wondrous, reverently upholding the scriptural instructions. Recite and study them morning and evening without weariness.
6. Do not pursue glory and splendor, severing worldly entanglements. Focus the mind and stabilize the will, directing all endeavors toward the Dharma.
7. Diligently recite the great scriptures, vowing for the sake of all beings to broadly establish bridges, creating karmic conditions for future lives.
8. Constantly generate good thoughts, neither deviating nor deceiving, harboring no envy, harm, malice, or jealousy.
9. Wherever one is reborn, may one always encounter a sagely age, continuously encountering the teachings of the *Numinous Treasure* without interruption.
10. Purify the body and uphold the precepts. Fast and establish merit, broadly rescuing all beings, universally delivering them.
11. Extensively study and broadly proclaim the profound Dharma, preparing for the inclusion of gods and humans, universally delivering all.
12. Always encounter enlightened masters, lifetime after lifetime, receiving their teachings and proclaiming the Dharma, delivering countless beings. Through all good thoughts, one attains the true Dao."

The Celestial Worthy said: "The method of cultivation for scholars lies in practicing these twelve principles. Those who single-mindedly cultivate these good thoughts will, lifetime after lifetime, behold the sacred texts and form karmic bonds with the Dao. Their celestial acquaintances will be many, and they will alone transcend the three realms, free from all entanglements, forever departing from the three evils, the five destinies, and the eight difficulties. Revered and protected by the myriad spirits, surrounded by earthly deities, their households will be pure and solemn, untouched by the ten thousand calamities. Truly, one may attain the Dao while seated in repose. Diligently study and recite, broadly proclaiming to fellow learners, that all may single-mindedly enter the Dharma-gate together."

The Celestial Worthy said: "The Dao is revered, the Dharma is wondrous, and the human body is also precious."

Thus the Dao unfolds the Dharma, bequeathing precept-scriptures to deliver the human body. Once the human body is delivered, it ascends to merge with the Dao. One should therefore cultivate purity in conduct, uphold fasting and observe the precepts, pacify the mind in stillness, and keep aspirations clear. Single-mindedly turn toward the Dao, maintain undivided focus, purify the six repositories, refrain from indulging beyond moderation, and keep inner and outer realms empty and serene, ever in accord with the natural. On the days of fasting, hold incense and make vows, so that one’s sincerity ascends to the heavens. The four heavenly patrol-lords and the ten divisions of mighty spirits will descend to walk the earth, observing and listening to the purest sounds, mirroring the clarity of your heart. Those who uphold the precepts and practice the Dao will have their merits recorded in the heavens, and karmic retribution will swiftly manifest. The Dao does not fail those who diligently practice and sincerely receive; do not let demonic words deceive you.

The Celestial Worthy said: "If good men and good women awaken the natural intention for the Dao, enter the Dharma-gate, receive my Ten Precepts, and practice the Twelve Permissible Observances, they shall be called pure and faithful disciples of the Great Dao, their merits equal to those of the valiant Flying Celestials. The Flying Celestials are those who have not yet attained the Dao; they are the tenfold-transformed disciples of the Great Dao, soaring through the empty sky as charioteers for the various heavens. Pure and faithful disciples, while still in the world, may be freed from sorrow and delivered from all suffering. Their bodies enter radiant light, their forms become inwardly pure and upright, and they summon ghosts and command spirits, subduing demonic forces. After ten transformations, they ascend to become Flying Celestials. If, in even a single transformation, they practice with diligence, their hearts unwavering and unrelenting, performing all manner of meritorious deeds, maintaining long fasts and austerities, tireless from dawn to dusk, they shall attain the rank of Flying Celestial. From there, they advance further, transcending the three realms to become Perfected Ones of the Upper Clarity.

The Celestial Worthy said: "Those who receive my Ten Precepts and practice the Twelve Permissible Observances should bow their heads and declare: 'As pure and faithful disciples, from this day forth we receive the precepts, single-mindedly upholding them, never daring to disbelieve, surrendering our lives to the ten directions.' Those who can do so will see their households flourish in this life, enjoying health and strength. Earthly deities will attend and protect them, the lords of the three realms will welcome them, and the souls of their seven ancestors will ascend to the Southern Palace, clothed and fed by the celestial kitchens. Soon they will be reborn, returning to the gates of human kings, their connection to the Dao unbroken across lifetimes."

The Celestial Worthy said: "When establishing fasts and practicing the Dao, the Four Heavenly Kings will ride upon flying cloud-cakes and eight-scene jade chariots, attended by Perfected Ones and jade maidens, their hands holding flowered banners. Phoenix songs lead the way, celestial music follows, with white cranes and lions chanting in harmony. They burn incense and scatter flowers, descending through the void to gaze upon the practice of the Dao and listen to the Dharma-sounds. The Heavenly Kings descend, and the myriad spirits pay homage. How could one not fully uphold this Dharma? First receive the Ten Precepts, then practice the Dao. Move with refined grace, still the mind and close the senses. Whether sitting, rising, lying down, or resting, never depart from proper conduct. The Heavenly Kings will rejoice, and your name will be recorded in the Upper Clarity. Truly, the attainment of the Dao lies within the space of a square inch."

**The Six Precepts of the Upper Grade for Closing the Passions and Cultivating Wisdom**

The first precept: Let the eyes not wander in broad gazing, lest they be distracted by the profusion of colors, harming the pupils and dimming the light, so that clarity is lost.

The second precept: Let the ears not indulge in chaotic listening, lest they be confused by the five tones, injuring the spirit and corrupting rectitude, drawn to evil sounds and mournful cries.

The third precept: Let the nose not seek out broad scents, lest it be tainted by impure qi and foul odors, leading to turbidity and a form that is not pure and upright.

The fourth precept: Let the mouth not crave flavors, especially those rich and greasy, lest they pollute the five spirits and cause the organs to fester and decay.

The fifth precept: Let the hands not commit evil, nor steal the belongings of others, nor covet profit for oneself, lest misfortune arise unawares.

The sixth precept: Let the heart not be swayed by desire, lest it agitate the five spirits, harming essence and scattering qi, leaving the body lost and confused.

The Celestial Worthy said: "These Six Precepts are the great afflictions of the body. Those who, in future lives, are born as men or women, though they receive human form, will have impure six senses. They will not have seen the scriptures or heard the Dharma-sounds, their forms unaware of themselves, sunk in the gates of sin, their lives cut short, failing to complete their heavenly years. They will long abide in evil destinies—how pitiful they are! Therefore, these precepts are expounded to deliver humans and gods. With a good heart, turn in faith, single-mindedly surrendering your life, revering and upholding the sacred teachings, closing the gates of evil. Then your form will enter the empty void, and you will attain the six penetrations of wisdom."

The six penetrations of wisdom are: penetrating vision, penetrating hearing, penetrating emptiness, penetrating voidness, penetrating clarity, and penetrating subtlety. These are the six penetrations, through which nothing is not penetrated. When the six senses are tranquil, the spirit naturally returns; unity naturally arises; essence naturally stabilizes; and life becomes long and enduring, never to die.

**The Six Great Precepts of the Upper Grade for Delivering Beings Through Wisdom**

The first: When you see someone in dire distress, deliver them from mortal peril. If you encounter the wise and enlightened in the world, you will be able to restrain the violent and rebellious. Your life will be long and enduring, and your worldly blessings boundless.

The second: When you see someone impoverished and destitute, suffering from hunger and cold, diminish your own body to bestow alms, bringing them wealth and nobility. The karmic reward will be ten thousandfold, and you will rejoice across lifetimes.

The third: When creatures of blood and breath, in their distress, turn to humans for refuge, be able to deliver and save them from mortal peril. In this life, you will enjoy health and strength, free from sudden misfortune.

The fourth: Bestow kindness upon birds and beasts, all living beings. Cut from your own mouth to feed them, sparing nothing. Across lifetimes, you will be sated and content, ever dwelling in blessed lands.

The fifth: Deliver all senseless creatures, all sentient beings, ensuring their completion without premature harm. In this life, you will flourish, untouched by manifold misfortunes.

The sixth: Always practice a heart of compassion, taking pity and delivering all beings, releasing life and saving from peril. The merit of this is profound. In this life, it will enable you to turn danger into safety, sickness into health, poverty into wealth, and all your aspirations will follow your heart.

The Celestial Worthy said: "These Six Precepts all arise from the heart’s penetration of wisdom. By bestowing virtue and acting in accord with the natural, blessings will constantly reside in your body, and misfortune will forever depart from your gate."

Those who indulge in worldly pleasures without cease will, lifetime after lifetime, reap the karmic consequences. Yet with a single turn of merit, their deeds align with the Flying Celestials, transcending the Nine Revolutions of the Wheel. Gradually, they enter the Great Dao. Disciples who achieve the Ten Revolutions have their names inscribed in the heavens. Their seven generations of ancestors ascend together, reborn in celestial realms, where they are clothed and fed by the blessings of virtue. Even in the human realm, they become Wheel-Turning Divine Kings, ever dwelling in the gates of fortune.

**The Ten Wholesome Exhortations to Assist the Supreme Precepts**

The first: Exhort and assist in revering the Three Treasures and making offerings to Dharma masters. This enables one to be reborn in the world as a noble person—virtuous, filial, and of lofty talent—honored and exalted, revered by all, with a flourishing clan.

The second: Exhort and assist in copying scriptures. This ensures that one is reborn lifetime after lifetime with keen intelligence, vast learning, and profound understanding, ever encountering sagely eras and able to recite the teachings and their verses.

The third: Exhort and assist in establishing fasting halls and tranquil abodes. This ensures that one’s family is reborn lifetime after lifetime in nobility, ascending to celestial realms where food and sustenance arise naturally, ever dwelling in non-action.

The fourth: Exhort and assist in providing incense and oil to those in need. This ensures that one is reborn lifetime after lifetime with fragrant purity, radiant brilliance, and an appearance of surpassing beauty, endowed with celestial grace and lofty refinement.

The fifth: Exhort and assist in providing Dharma robes for Dharma masters. This ensures that one is reborn lifetime after lifetime with enduring elegance, freely dwelling in the Central Kingdom, never falling among borderland barbarians, with sons and daughters of upright bearing, adorned with crowns, jade, and pendants.

The sixth: Exhort and assist kings, parents, and the people in loyalty and filial piety. This ensures that one is reborn lifetime after lifetime with many descendants—sons and daughters of wisdom and virtue—spared from all suffering.

The seventh: Exhort and assist in fasting, tranquility, and scripture recitation. This ensures that one is never reborn in hell but ascends directly to celestial realms, where they pay homage to the multitude of sages. Swiftly, they regain their form, transforming and being reborn in royal households, their every desire fulfilled, their adornments and possessions complete. Their seven generations of ancestors rejoice together, all karmic affinities harmoniously met. From beginning to end, they abide in glory and joy. As the Dharma Wheel turns, they attain the immortal Dao.

The eighth: Exhort and assist Daoists and the people in scriptural study. This ensures that one is reborn lifetime after lifetime with penetrating wisdom and insight, their every movement and stillness imbued with dignity, ever serving as a teacher to others.

The ninth: Exhort and assist all in almsgiving and admonition. This ensures that one is reborn lifetime after lifetime with long life, wealth, and joy, ever free from resentment and sorrow.

The tenth: Exhort and assist all people in relinquishing jealousy and desire, practicing the myriad virtues. This ensures that one is reborn lifetime after lifetime in peace and happiness, free from calamity and disorder. The sick recover, officials ascend in rank, and all look up to them with reverence. None fail to receive blessings. Their households are pure and noble, cherished by celestials and humans, revered by spirits and demons, ever dwelling in lands of fortune.

The Celestial Worthy said: "These Ten Wholesome Exhortations can only be practiced by disciples of the Great Dao who have achieved the Ten Revolutions. Those who can practice them will have deeds equal to the Flying Celestials, their hearts in harmony with the Six Penetrations of wisdom, merging with the emptiness of the void. After death, they will all soar through the clouds, with the multitude of sages guiding their chariots as they roam the ten directions. From this, they will never slacken, attaining the rank of Immortal Kings. Their seven generations of ancestors will depart the dark night, ascending to the Southern Palace, where they are clothed and fed by celestial kitchens, receiving blessings naturally. This Dharma is lofty and wondrous, delivering countless beings. Its vast transformation is beyond measure."

The Celestial Worthy said: "The Six Penetrations of wisdom are as follows: Heaven is called *Dongshi* (Penetrating Sight), Earth is called *Dongting* (Penetrating Hearing), the East is called *Dongkong* (Penetrating Emptiness), the West is called *Dongxu* (Penetrating Void), the South is called *Dongqing* (Penetrating Purity), and the North is called *Dongwei* (Penetrating Subtlety). The Six Penetrations pervade the boundless, without limit or end, unfathomable and inexhaustible, encompassing all, containing all. Those who possess the *qi* of the Six Awarenesses constantly connect with the Six Wisdoms. When human perception attains the Six Penetrations, the Six Awarenesses become luminous. Mastering the Six Emotions, one naturally discards all evil roots and generates wholesome thoughts. When the heart embodies the Six Wisdoms, one attains the immortal Dao."

The Celestial Worthy said: "The foundation of the Dao is this: to deliver beings from the Ten Sufferings and Eight Adversities, one must receive the Great Precepts, cultivate fasting, establish virtue, and perform wholesome deeds, so as to be praised by the Three Realms and observed by all celestials. Thus, none will fail to be delivered, and the Dao will be perfected. Without receiving the Great Precepts, merely practicing prolonged fasting, abstaining from grains, or retreating to the mountains—seeking deliverance in the flesh without the practice of the Six Penetrations of wisdom—will only waste one’s efforts, with no hope of accomplishment. Good men and good women of sincere hearts, diligently seek and earnestly receive them. Now that this scripture is expounded, may its teachings widely deliver all, so that the Dharma’s voice is universally heard in the ten directions."

The Celestial Worthy said: "Heaven is *Dongshi* (Penetrating Sight), its wisdom the Heavenly Eye, its insight boundless. From above and below, the four directions and eight quarters, nothing is unseen, nothing is unclear. Though called a single Penetration of wisdom, it encompasses the Five Colors. Heaven’s penetration is natural, thus undamaged. Humans emulate Heaven: the red pupil of the eye also possesses the light of the Five Colors. If one does not uphold the precepts, the *qi* of the Six Awarenesses will not flow through the human apertures, and wisdom will not unfold. Gazing widely at the Five Colors causes the eye’s pupil to scatter, its light to dim and become obscured, leading to blindness. Therefore, these precepts are expounded to deliver celestials and humans, so that all men and women may hear the Dharma’s voice. To attain deliverance and longevity, one must uphold these precepts and practice them diligently, never forgetting. Guard against excessive indulgence in sensory desires, restrain the wandering gaze, and master oneself. Cherish and nurture the eye’s pupil, contemplate the true and still, allowing wisdom to penetrate. With penetrating vision of the void and self-mastery through the precepts, the Five Colors will return to the body. When the Five Colors naturally return, there will be no damage. Preserve your years and life, and they may become boundless."

The Celestial Worthy said: "Earth is *Dongting* (Penetrating Hearing), its wisdom far-reaching. Thus, its resonance responds to Heaven above and pervades the four directions below, nothing unheard, nothing unperceived. Though called a single Penetration of wisdom, it encompasses the Five Sounds. Earth’s penetration is natural, giving rise to the Five Sounds, stable and unmoving, thus undamaged."

Just as humans resemble Earth, within the ear dwell the spirits of the Five Sounds. If one does not uphold the precepts, wisdom remains obstructed, and one must not recklessly heed the sounds of the Five Tones. The Five Tones cause the Five Spirits to scatter and soar, leaving the ear hollow and desolate, resounding with sorrowful wails. The Five Spirits weep, leading to deafness. Thus, these precepts are expounded to deliver celestial beings, that all men and women may universally hear the Dharma’s resonance. To attain longevity, one must uphold the Great Precepts, restraining the ear’s spirit—refraining from excessive listening to unlawful sounds, and instead serenely heeding the wondrous scriptures and divine chapters of the Perfected. This allows wisdom to penetrate, resonating through the Great Void. By upholding the precepts to master oneself, the Five Sounds return to the body. When the Five Sounds naturally return, the ear remains free of harmful noises. Preserve your years and life, and they may endure boundlessly.

The Celestial Worthy said: "The East is *Dongkong* (Penetrating Void), the qi of Primordial Yang. Qi emerges from the Void, its wisdom luminous and its insight vast, thus called *Dongkong*. Its penetration is boundless, unfathomable. The qi of nascent green, though termed a single Penetration of wisdom, encompasses the Five Qi. The Void admits all, thus it suffers no damage. Though humans possess form, form too follows the Void. The nose harbors *Huangning*, the spirit that repels impurity. If one does not uphold the precepts, wisdom remains obstructed. Without entering wisdom, one must not indiscriminately consume foul and rank substances. The qi of foulness and rankness congests the nose’s spirit, causing the meridian’s source to risk severance, obstructing the *Mingliang* (Luminous Bridge). Thus, these precepts are expounded to deliver celestial beings, that all men and women may hear the Dharma’s resonance. To transcend the Eight Difficulties and myriad sufferings, one must receive these precepts, restraining the nose’s spirit—refraining from excessive intake of foulness, purifying the *Mingliang*, guiding and conducting the qi of life, illuminating wisdom. When qi penetrates the Void, and the precepts master the self, the manifold qi return to the body. When the qi naturally return, merging with the primordial qi, one preserves life and form, forever free from harm."

The Celestial Worthy said: "The West is *Dongxu* (Penetrating Emptiness), the qi of Lesser Yang. Qi emerges from Emptiness, its wisdom subtle and its insight radiant, thus called *Dongxu*. Its emptiness is unimpeded, its penetration vast and unfathomable. The qi of Lesser Yin, though termed a single Penetration of wisdom, encompasses the Five Flavors. Emptiness admits all, contains all. Though humans follow Emptiness, if the body does not uphold the precepts, wisdom remains obstructed. Without wisdom’s entry, the Five Flavors become afflictions. Craving rich and greasy foods disturbs the Five Spirits, leading to collapse and exhaustion, shortening one’s years and life. Thus, these precepts are expounded to deliver celestial beings, that all men and women may universally hear the Dharma’s resonance. To attain long life, one must uphold the Great Precepts, restraining the Five Spirits—guarding against greed for the Five Flavors, moderating rich and greasy indulgences, purifying the Five Viscera, keeping them cool and clear. When the body possesses wisdom, the Five Flavors harmonize as fragrance, inner and outer tranquility prevail, and life remains unharmed."

The Celestial Worthy said: "The South is *Dongqing* (Penetrating Clarity), the qi of Greater Yang. Qi emerges from Clarity, its wisdom pure and its insight lucid, opening the gates to penetrate clarity. Thus, the South harbors the Crimson Emperor’s *Dongyang* (Penetrating Yang) Court, where the myriad things are smelted and refined to brilliance. If one does not uphold the precepts, wisdom remains obstructed. Without wisdom’s flow, the heart’s spirit trembles, giving rise to craving and desire, leading to delusion and dissipation, harming the spirit and shortening life, preventing longevity. Thus, these precepts are expounded to deliver celestial beings, that all men and women may universally hear the Dharma’s resonance. To attain long life and transcend all afflictions, one must receive these precepts, restraining the heart’s spirit—dispelling passions, relinquishing desires, forsaking the dust to enter Clarity. When wisdom illuminates, the Six Perceptions open their passages, the body enters *Dongqing*, merging with the qi of nature. Preserve your years and life, and they may endure eternally."

The Celestial Worthy said: "The North is *Dongwei* (Penetrating Subtlety), born of the Mysterious. Its wisdom is far-reaching, its insight profound, subtle yet penetrating the Real. It discerns the dark and light of sin and fortune, presiding over the origin of life. The hands emulate the Four Seasons, corresponding above to the Celestial Gate. As the Celestial Gate eternally turns, so too do the hands move. The hands possess a great spirit, receiving life and filling the directions, governing the Four Great Elements of humanity, observing human success and failure. If one does not uphold the precepts, wisdom remains obstructed. Without wisdom’s flow, the heart is agitated, and myriad evils arise. The hands act unconsciously, indulging in greed and theft, leading to a shortened life, failing to complete Heaven’s allotted years. Thus, these precepts are expounded to deliver celestial beings. To attain long life and transcend evil roots, one must receive these precepts, restraining the hands’ spirit. When wisdom illuminates, the heart naturally opens in clarity. The hands refrain from theft, evil roots do not arise, aligning with Heaven and following qi. The body enters nature, preserving your life to endure eternally."

**Precepts of Wisdom, Virtue, and Retribution (Upper Grade)**

The Precepts state: Offerings and alms to the Three Treasures and divine scriptures—even a single coin—shall be repaid seventy-four myriadfold. Ten thousand coins or more bring boundless reward. One’s name is recorded among the heavens, the body ascends as a Ten-Times-Transmitted Disciple of the Most High, and the seven ancestors rise to become honored guests of the heavens.

The greater the merit, the greater the reward. **Generation after generation, they shall be rich and noble, their joy boundless, and their seven ancestors shall all receive sustenance from the four directions’ heavenly kitchens, their clothing and food naturally provided.**

The Precepts state: Offerings to all beings, sacrificing one’s own provisions to feed others—even a single coin—shall be repaid six thousand two hundredfold. **Generation after generation, their descendants shall flourish, their households prosper, and their seven ancestors shall escape the hells, ascending into the blessings of the natural realm.**

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Lord of the Dao, saying: "The Precepts of Wisdom and the Upper Grade of Merit and Virtue—when men and women of heaven and earth awaken the natural intent of the Dao, sacrifice their own resources, and expand the fields of blessings, their merit is most weighty. The merit of a single offering brings a reward of ten thousandfold. The principle of karmic retribution is as clear as the sun and moon, whether manifest in this life or the next. Yet the timing of blessings may vary, and they need not arrive simultaneously. Some may calculate merit to offset transgressions, or use virtue to redeem sins, or liberate their ancestors from punishments—such retributions may not be immediately apparent. The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus record the merits and transgressions of all, with not even the smallest fraction lost. Though one’s sins may have been erased and no further transgressions committed, if later merits remain unmanifested, they may appear no different from the ordinary. This arises from the constraints of one’s birth destiny, awaiting the heavens’ deliverance before blessings unfold. Even so, the souls of the seven ancestors shall have already ascended to the heavenly halls, and the convergence of blessings thereafter shall be without error. Clearly proclaim this to men and women, that they may know karmic retribution is no empty truth. With sincere faith and diligent practice, unwavering in effort, they shall attain deliverance and receive boundless blessings."

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Lord of the Dao, saying: "All the sagely beings of the heavens, the perfected and great divinities, the heavenly kings, and the countless past multitudes who attained the Dao—none failed to do so through almsgiving, spreading virtue, and performing myriad good deeds. When merit is fulfilled and virtue complete, good retribution follows, ceaseless in its turning. All shall become perfected beings of the Dao, transcending the Three Realms, carefree in the Great Canopy of the Upper Clarity and the Heaven of Great Network, amidst the Seven Jeweled Forests of the Jade Capital and Mystic Terrace. Then shall they know that no act of merit is ever lost, their joy natural and measureless, their blessings infinite for all generations. Yet in this degenerate age, human nature is stingy and greedy, knowing only how to hoard, burdening themselves with wealth, unable to awaken the heart to perform such meritorious deeds. Without accumulated merit, defilements and transgressions grow daily, and the halls of eternal blessings sink into the gates of sin. They shall revolve endlessly through the Five Paths and Eight Difficulties. Once the blessed realm is lost, there shall be no return. Men and women shall drag one another along, unaware of their past lives’ origins, and the sight of their souls shall be most pitiable. Now, for the sake of all heavens, I proclaim these prohibitions and precepts, that all men and women may universally hear the Dharma’s sound, be delivered from the multitudes, and enter into blessings."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "I have surveyed the hells beneath the heavens and earth, where the souls of men and women toil in dark prisons—none were not those who, in past lives, either failed to encounter these luminous precepts, or having encountered them, did not practice them, or practiced them without devotion, later regretting and returning to the gates of sin. Some were born into evil, never meeting good conditions, or unaware of almsgiving, never awakening the heart to establish merit, broadly cultivate fields of blessings, and uproot karmic roots. Knowing only how to commit transgressions, they drift through the Three Wretched Paths and Eight Difficulties. Pitying their ignorance, I grieve for them. Thus, I proclaim these precepts to deliver the heavenly and mortal realms, that all men and women may universally hear the Dharma’s sound, awaken the heart of the Dao, establish good deeds, uproot all suffering, and form affinities with the Dao. All shall know joy and peace, carefree and natural."

The Most High Lord of the Dao received the precepts from the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, delivering them to all heavens, the four directions, and borderlands. When the merit was accomplished, they were transmitted to the Heavenly Kings of all heavens, the Great Sages of the Ten Directions, the Celestial Lord of the Grand Tenuity, the Perfected of the Four Poles, the Great Divinities of the Eastern Florescence Palace, the Jade Maidens and hosts of immortals, that all might propagate them and save future generations, allowing them to hear the Dharma’s sound. At that time, all the heavens rejoiced, saying, "Excellent! Excellent!"

**The Upper Grade Precepts of Wisdom from the Most High Cavern of Mystery and Numinous Treasure thus concludes.**
