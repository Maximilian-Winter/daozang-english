**The Supreme Secret Method of the Talismanic Charm for Pacifying the Household**

According to the *Upper Prime Scripture*, Emperor Wen of Han once asked the Heavenly Elder: "What is meant by a household said to possess the 'Three Foolish Dwellings'?"

The Heavenly Elder replied: "The 'Three Foolish Dwellings' are as follows: a dwelling with high ground in front and low ground behind is the first foolishness; one with flowing water to the north is the second foolishness; and one with high ground to the southeast and level ground to the northwest is the third foolishness."

One day, the Emperor, traveling incognito, arrived at the border of Hongnong County and saw a household residing precisely in such a "Three Foolish Dwellings." The family was exceedingly wealthy, with over fifty members. The Emperor was greatly astonished and returned to the palace.

The following day, he summoned two officials versed in yin-yang arts, changed their attire, and together they visited the household’s gate, intending to inquire about the dwelling’s circumstances. Upon seeing them, the gatekeeper immediately reported to the master: "There are three visitors at the gate seeking an audience."

Jinping, having heard this, hastily ordered them to be invited in and welcomed them into the hall. After the exchange of courtesies, they sat in the hall. Jinping prepared wine, and during the drinking, the Emperor asked the master: "What is your surname?"

The master replied: "My surname is Liu, and my given name is Jinping."

The Emperor then asked: "How many years have you lived in this dwelling?"

Jinping answered: "I have lived here for over thirty years."

The Emperor said: "According to the *Dwelling Scripture*, this is precisely a 'Three Foolish Dwellings,' a place of great inauspiciousness where one should not reside. What method have you employed to transform it into a peaceful and auspicious dwelling? I wish to hear of it."

Jinping replied: "From the beginning of my residence here, this dwelling was plagued by disasters—loss of wealth, harm to family members, official troubles and illnesses year after year, unrest among livestock, and distress among all household members, reducing us to extreme poverty. One evening, as dusk approached, two scholars, arriving from an unknown direction, sought lodging and food at my home. Due to my poverty, I could only offer them a simple porridge. After they had eaten, they asked why I lived in such an inauspicious dwelling. I replied that my poverty made it impossible to move elsewhere. The two scholars said: 'We possess a method to protect your dwelling; you need not relocate.' I bowed and entreated them to bestow their method upon me, and I was willing to receive their instruction. The two scholars then transmitted these seventy-two talismanic charms for pacifying the household. They declared that after ten years of pacification, great wealth and nobility would follow for twenty years, and descendants would flourish for thirty years. Moreover, a 'White-Robed Son of Heaven' would surely enter the dwelling. All these predictions have come to pass, except for the 'White-Robed Son of Heaven,' which has yet to be verified."

Emperor Wen smiled and asked: "Where are the two scholars now?"

Jinping replied: "After transmitting the talismanic method, they took their leave. After walking about fifty paces from the gate, they vanished, leaving only a streak of white qi ascending into the heavens."

The Emperor asked: "May I see the talismans?"

Jinping then presented the talismans to the Emperor. Having obtained them, Emperor Wen returned to the palace and ordered their widespread implementation. These talismans, disseminated throughout the realm, pacified households and provided universal protection, bringing purity and auspiciousness to every family and peace and well-being to every household. The Supreme Perfected bestowed their protection, preventing the arising of disasters and calamities. Longevity and fortune increased, descendants achieved honor and prominence, silkworm and field yields doubled, and livestock flourished. Malevolent spirits and pernicious influences were swept away, and demonic vapors were eradicated. The talismanic charms, wondrous and efficacious, eternally safeguarded the gates and courtyards.

The efficacy of these talismans is well-documented, with numerous accounts of their origins. Though it is difficult to recount them all, they have been carved onto printing blocks to disseminate their transmission widely.
