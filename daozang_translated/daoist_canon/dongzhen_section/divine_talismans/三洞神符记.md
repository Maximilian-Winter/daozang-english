# 三洞神符记

**Record of the Three Caverns’ Divine Talismans**

**Title:** *Record of the Three Caverns’ Divine Talismans*. Author unknown, likely composed during the Tang dynasty. Originally a chapter in the *Great Treatise of the Daoist Gate*, later extracted as an independent text. One scroll. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Cavern of Perfection Division, Category of Divine Talismans. See also *Seven Lots from the Cloudy Satchel*, Scroll 7.

**Record of the Three Caverns’ Divine Talismans: On the Methods of the Three Origins, Eight Convergences, and Six Scripts**

The *Great Treatise of the Daoist Gate* states: At the primordial division of yin and yang, there arose the qi of the Three Origins, Five Powers, and Eight Convergences, forming the *Flying Script of the Heavens*. Later, these were compiled into the *Luminous Chapters of the Eight Dragons’ Cloud Seal*.

Master Lu explained the Three Capacities as the Three Origins. Once the Three Origins were established, the Five Phases were complete. Taking the Five Phases as five positions, the harmonization of three and five was called the Eight Convergences, serving as the foundation of all scripts. There were also the *Luminous Chapters of the Eight Dragons’ Cloud Seal*, wherein the natural, soaring, mysterious qi coalesced in the void to form writing. Each character spanned a zhang in size, originating within the various heavens to give rise to all things.

According to the *True Reports* as recounted by Lady Ziwei of the Purple Tenuity, the *Script of the Three Origins and Eight Convergences* is the progenitor of all literary compositions. The *Eight Dragons’ Cloud Seal* is the root and origin of all writing. It is also said: The Eight Convergences correspond to the Three Capacities and Five Phases, taking form after the separation of existence. Another text states: The *Five Chapters of the Vermilion Script of Numinous Treasure* emerged prior to the Primordial Beginning. Thus, the Three Origins cannot refer to the Three Capacities, nor can the Five Powers refer to the Five Phases. These must instead be the Three Qi of the Venerable Lord of the Three Treasures. These Three Qi are not the Five Powers. Therefore, the *Verses on the Generation of the Nine Heavens* states: "The myriad transformations of heaven and earth, if not nurtured by the Three Origins and guided by the Nine Qi, cannot come into being." It further says: "The Three Qi are the honor of heaven and earth; the Nine Qi are the root of the myriad things." Thus, these Three Origins existed before the opening of heaven and earth and the birth of the Three Capacities.

Master Song explained the Eight Convergences as merely the Three Qi and Five Powers. The Three Origins are: first, the qi of the *Chaotic Cavern of the Supreme Jade Emperor of Primordial Vacuity*; second, the qi of the *Vermilion Chaos of the Supreme Jade Purity of Primordial Vacuity*; third, the qi of the *Mysterious Tranquility of the Supreme Jade Void of Primordial Vacuity*. The Five Powers are the convergence of three and five within the Three Origins, namely the harmony of yin and yang. Yin comprises Lesser Yin and Greater Yin; yang comprises Lesser Yang and Greater Yang. The harmony within harmony constitutes the Five Powers.

*Seal* (篆) means *to compile* (撰), referring to the compilation of cloud scripts, hence the term *cloud seal*. This encompasses the texts of the Three Origins and Eight Convergences, as well as the *Chapters of the Eight Dragons’ Cloud Seal*. All are celestial scripts, exemplified by the Three Origins and Eight Convergences. The *Cloud Seal of Luminous Radiance* corresponds to the examples of the Five Talismans and Five Victories.

The original text of the Eight Convergences comprises 1,109 characters. The true script of its chapters totals 668 characters. These are the primordial roots of the Three Capacities, giving rise to heaven and earth, unfolding the transformations of humans and spirits, and serving as the origin of the myriad things. Hence, it is said there are the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Earth, the Dao of Spirits, and the Dao of Humans—this is what is meant.

The *Jade Instructions* states: In practicing this method, the Five Chapters are divided by character count, each with four applications:
1. To summon the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Thearchs, verify the registers of divine immortals, and seek transcendence to attain perfection.
2. To summon the celestial lodges and stellar palaces, rectify the divisions of heaven, and safeguard the state and pacify the people.
3. To restrain and control the qi of the Six Heavens of Fengdu.
4. To command the Water Thearch and summon dragons and birds.

Regarding the inner sounds of the various heavens: each heaven has eight characters, and the thirty-two heavens together comprise 256 characters. These expound upon the measurements and conjunctions of the heavens, the names and titles of great sages and true immortals, the offices they govern, the locations of their terrace-cities, the transformations and ascents of immortals, the ranks of their descents, the classifications of demons, and the karmic causes of human and ghostly rebirths. Thirteen characters denote the names of the primordial essences of the Five Directions, used in methods for ingesting and refining, cultivating the spirit and transforming the form, and ascending in broad daylight. The remaining 122 characters lack explanations of their primordial sounds.

Second, the Eight Convergences are developed into the scripts of dragons and phoenixes, called *Dragon Script*. All that follows was transmitted by the mysterious sages to transcribe celestial writing.

Third, during the time of the Yellow Thearch, Cang Jie, observing the forms of dragons and phoenixes and gathering the traces of birds, created ancient script to replace knotted cords—this is the ancient form.

Fourth, during the Zhou dynasty, Shi Zhou transformed ancient script into *Greater Seal Script*.

Fifth, during the Qin dynasty, Cheng Miao altered *Greater Seal Script* into *Lesser Seal Script*.

Sixth, after the Qin, Xu Yang of Xuyang transformed *Lesser Seal Script* into *Clerical Script*. It is also said that the Han referred to clerical script as *Assistant Script*. Some claim Cheng Miao created it while imprisoned, deriving it from the writing of convict laborers, hence the name *clerical*. These constitute the Six Scripts.

**Cloud Seal**
There are also the *Luminous Chapters of the Cloud Seal*, which follow the forms of Sanskrit script. The texts are divided into sixty-four types, disseminated across the thirty-six heavens. In contemporary scriptural transmission, celestial writing is explained using clerical characters, intermingled in practice.

**Eight Forms, Six Scripts, Six Writings**
1. Greater Seal Script
2. Lesser Seal Script
3. Talisman-Carving Script
4. Worm Script
5. Seal-Engraving Script
6. Title Script
7. Weapon Script
8. Clerical Script

During the reign of Wang Mang, the Minister of Education, Zhen Feng, was tasked with standardizing writing, resulting in the Six Writings:
1. Ancient Script (the script from Confucius’ wall)
2. Variant Characters (ancient script with unusual forms)
3. Seal Script
4. Assistant Script (clerical script)
5. Curling Seal Script (used for engraving seals)
6. Bird Seal Script (transliteration)

Cang Jie’s initial writing must have employed brushes. The *Book of Songs* mentions "vermilion tubes," which were brushes. The claim that Meng Tian invented the brush likely stems from his prominence as a Qin general across three generations, whose refined brush-making technique earned him sole renown.

During the reign of Emperor He of Han, Cai Lun first created paper. Before this, only bamboo slips and wooden tablets were used for writing. *Die* (tablets) served to record matters in detail, while *jian* (slips) were concise and uncluttered. Yet it was known that the original script was the Celestial Script of the Golden Slips; all other scripts—from earthly writings downward, the Eight Styles and Six Writings—derived externally from the true form, which scholars may further investigate.

It remains unknown when texts were first transcribed onto paper to form scrolls. Now, it is said that brushes existed from the beginning of the kalpa, and the Supreme Perfection (Tai Zhen) inscribed them—how could they be absent? And what of the Eight Styles and Six Writings? For the Celestial Venerable (Tian Zun) embodies creation, encompassing all methods.

Later generations inherited and employed these, naturally developing them in sequence. The Six Writings are as follows:
1. **Pictographic**—such as the sun and moon;
2. **Indicative**—such as "above" and "below";
3. **Phono-semantic**—such as rivers and seas;
4. **Associative**—such as "martial" (武) and "trust" (信);
5. **Mutually explanatory**—such as "elder" (考) and "aged" (老);
6. **Phonetic loan**—such as "command" (令) and "chief" (长).

**Talismanic Script**
All myriad things operate through the essence of *qi*. Thus, the Two Modes (yin and yang) and Three Luminaries (sun, moon, stars) all function through the *qi* within them. Once the myriad things exist, they too operate through the *qi* within them. Therefore, the Five Phases and Six Entities all possess *qi*.

By spreading the refined *qi* of the Dao onto bamboo slips and ink, and uniting it with the *qi* of things, one repels deceit and falsehood, aids the true and authentic, summons and assembles the host of spirits, governs life and death, sustains the kalpic order, and stabilizes the Five Directions.

These talismans originate from the structuring of emptiness. The Supreme Perfection (Tai Zhen) transcribed the celestial patterns by gazing upward, arranging them according to directional positions and distinguishing the differences among talismanic diagrams, script, and charts.

- **Talismans** (*fu*) draw upon the configurations of clouds, phenomena, and celestial bodies;
- **Script** (*shu*) distinguishes and analyzes sounds, phrases, and their measured meanings;
- **Charts** (*tu*) depict the forms of numinous transformations.

Yet talismans contain script, blending with the semblance of diagrams, while script contains charts, employing both form and sound. Thus, the Eight Styles and Six Writings mutually elucidate one another.

**The Eight Manifestations**
The Eight Manifestations are:
1. **Celestial Script**—the Eightfold Convergence;
2. **Divine Script**—Cloud Seal Script;
3. **Earthly Script**—the forms of dragons and phoenixes;
4. **Inner Script**—what tortoises, dragons, fish, and birds disgorge;
5. **Outer Script**—borne by scales, shells, feathers, and fur;
6. **Demonic Script**—miscellaneous, obscure forms incomprehensible to humans;
7. **Central States Script**—grass script and Cloud Seal Script;
8. **Barbarian Script**—resembling the tracks of insects and worms.

Among these Six Writings and Eight Styles, some modern characters resemble ancient ones, or ancient characters resemble modern ones. Talismanic colors intermingle, collectively forming a single method and serving a unified purpose—thus, their similarities and differences are not fixed.

This follows the explanation of Master Song, though the original text has not been seen. In the Three Caverns scriptures, talismans with characters resemble the ancient characters in the *Book of Documents*, some of which remain identical to those of today.

**Jade-Character Formula**
The Supreme Dao Lord (Tai Shang Dao Jun) at the Southern Cinnabar Cavern of Yang’s Summit bestowed this numinous script and Jade-Character Formula upon the scholar Wang Long. It remains uncertain to which era the commentary belongs; scholars may investigate it further.

It also expounds methods for talismanic rites, offerings to the Five Directions, visualization, and disaster aversion—precisely the interpretive formulas for the Eightfold Convergence. Within the original text’s principles, it further clarifies the logic, much like elucidating the principles of resonance within the true script.

The *Scripture on Stabilizing the Will* asks: Does this emerge from the subtleties of thought? Matters contain further matters, as in the *Jade Formula*, which further clarifies the transmission of scriptures and the solemn rituals of covenant bestowal. Thus, all scriptures containing interpretive formulas are collectively called *Jade Formulas*.

**August Script of the Thearchs**
The *Scripture of the Three August Ones* states: The August Script of the Thearchs arises naturally from emptiness and non-being, forming characters from *qi* congealed in the void. Without origin or precedence, without end or limit, it appears and vanishes with the kalpic cycles yet endures eternally.

**Celestial Script**
The *Scripture of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens* states: Suddenly, a celestial script appeared, its characters a *zhang* square, naturally manifesting in the void. Its text shimmered with radiant colors, its eight corners trailing beams of light, its luminous brilliance dazzling the eyes, rendering it unreadable.

The Celestial Perfected Sovereign (Tian Zhen Huang Ren) said: This script is august and wondrous, beyond ordinary comparison. Thus, it inaugurated the beginning of the Great Existence and sealed the celestial radiance to treasure the Dao and honor its script. Its characters are profound and recondite, unlike the forms of common writing—it esteems its wondrous imagery and conceals its ultimate truth.

**Dragon Script**
The *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* states: When the Vermilion Clarity unfolded the celestial chart, the workings of destiny proceeded naturally. The Primordial Beginning (Yuan Shi) stabilized and settled it, scattering the Five Chapters. The Vermilion Script of Jade Characters and the Eightfold Might of Dragon Script safeguard the kalpic order, ensuring the heavens endure eternally. This is the Dragon Script.

**Phoenix Script**
The *Scripture of the Vermilion Phoenix* states: This scripture’s original text was stored within the Purple Chamber of the Six Harmonies of the Supreme Lord (Tai Shang), guarded by six-headed lion-like beasts flanking the walls, with jade lads and jade maidens attending the Phoenix Script.

**Jade Tablets and Golden Script**
The Three Primes distribute the scriptures, all inscribed as Golden Cinnabar Scripts, contained in bags of natural cloud brocade, sealed with the talismanic seals of the Three Primes, and stored in the Palace of Great Existence above the Nine Heavens—these are called Jade Tablets and Golden Script.

It is also said: They are inscribed on purple jade slips, with characters of raw gold, bound with golden threads and wrapped in azure silk.

The *Canons of the Supreme Perfection* state: Jade Tablets and Golden Script are inscribed on slips of the Seven Treasures, also called Purple Slips.

**Stone Characters**
The *Scripture of Fundamental Practices* states: The Dao said: In the past, in the world of Chan Li, there was a King of the Realm of Dust who had a daughter named Gua Yin. Though born mute, by the age of fourteen, her parents found this strange and abandoned her in the empty mountains south of the Southern Floating Mulberry. Wandering the mountains, she suddenly encountered a divine person at the Cypress Grove beneath the Cinnabar Mound’s abode. The divine being took Gua Yin’s right hand and inscribed upon a red stone, saying to Gua Yin: Though you cannot speak, you may remember this.

Heaven, moved by her plight, took pity on her affliction and dispatched the Vermilion Palace’s Divine Youth to teach Gua Yin the arts of bodily preservation, bestowing upon her the Eight-Character Red Script. Thereupon, Gua Yin could speak.

The *Scripture of the Jade Essentials of the Numinous Treasure* states: The Dao addressed A Qiu Zeng, saying: In your past life, you and the Southern Culmen’s Venerable Deity dwelled together in the world of Chan Li. Beneath the Cypress Grove at the Cinnabar Mound’s abode, you both resolved to pursue the Dao. At that time, the Southern Culmen was surnamed Huang and named Du Ming. He took your right hand, and together you inscribed the red stone to record your names. The Southern Palace later transcribed your brushstrokes onto the Southern Pavilion, where they remain to this day. The stone characters also endure—do you recall them? Qiu Zeng’s heart awakened, and lifting his gaze, he beheld what the Southern Culmen had presided over: on the southern wall, carved script read: *In the Tai Jia year, on the first day of the seventh month, Huang Du Ming and Wang A Qiu Zeng together made their vow beneath the Cypress Grove of the Cinnabar Mound*—twenty-three characters in all, each perfectly distinct.

**Inscribed on Plain Silk**
The *Scripture of the Five Talismans* states: When the Five Talismans are transmitted as one, they are inscribed on *nanhe* silk—*nanhe* being red silk. They are sealed in a casket of golden blossoms, stamped with the seal of the Dark Capital, and entrusted to the Lord of the Shocking Waters Grotto’s Mystery.

The *Scripture of the Questions of the Immortal Duke* states: The *Scriptures of the Dao and Its Virtue (Upper and Lower)*, the *Mysterious Scripture of the Cavern of Perfection*, the *Celestial Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, and the various odes of the Highest Clarity—all were composed by the Most High and inscribed on *nanhe* silk, hence called *inscribed on plain silk*.

**Jade Characters**
The *Scripture of the Inner Sounds and Jade Characters* states: The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign said: The inner sounds of the heavens are naturally jade characters, each a *zhang* in breadth, spontaneously manifesting in the Void Mystery above. Their eight corners radiate beams, their luminous essence dazzling the eyes. The numinous script of the Eight Assemblies bears no fixed form; its purport is profound and recondite, difficult to fathom in detail. All are the great Brahmanic hidden language of the heavens, congealed from the soaring mystery of *qi*, harmonizing the sounds of the five directions. They arose above the Primordial Beginning and emerged from the Cavernous Void, unfolding with the turning of the kalpas to universally accomplish the work of heaven and earth. The Heavenly Worthy commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to annotate their correct sounds, that the sovereign’s Dao might flow clearly and its blessings extend to the ten directions. The Sovereign dared not disobey, and taking up his brush, annotated them, saying: Though my spirit and soul may suddenly perish, I shall record what I have witnessed, briefly annotating the meaning of the Five Harmonies. This Dao suffices to open the path and deliver heaven and humanity. Harmonizing the five directions and the boundless sounds, it perfects the inner sounds of the heavens—hence the meaning of the Five Harmonies.

**Script Born in the East**
The *Scripture of Great Peace* states: Script is born in the East and flourishes in the South. Thus, celestial script arises in the northeast, and writings emerge from the northeast, where heaven reveals its patterns. The tiger bears markings and dwells in the *yin* (third earthly branch). The dragon bears markings and dwells in the *chen* (fifth earthly branch). Script is born in the East and thrives in the South—thus true script first appears in the northeast.

**Jade Register**
The *Hidden Writings of Jade Clarity* contain the Emperor’s Slips of Gold Script and the Mysterious Jade Registers, which may transmit the *Feathered Jade Scripture of the Cavern of Mystery*. It further states: Without the Emperor’s Chart and Jade Register, one may not hear or behold the Hidden Writings of the Jade Wisdom of the Highest Sovereign, the Jade Clarity, or the Feathered Scriptures of the Golden Mystery and Hidden Mystery.

**Jade Chapters**
The *Preface to the Many Chapters* states: The Primordial Beginning commanded the Great Perfected to take up the brush, while the Jade Consort swept the mat. Gold was cast into slips, and the Jade Chapters were inscribed. The Five Elders recorded them, secreting them in the Palace of the Nine Numinous Immortals, where they were stored in cloud-woven caskets and transmitted to the Immortal Duke Ge.

**Jade Tablets**
The *Scripture of the Golden Root* states: The Most High Lord of the Great Dao entrusted the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern* to the High Minister, the Azure Youth, who recorded it in the Azure Palace of the Eastern Flowery Capital to transmit to later sages destined to become Perfected Ones. These golden slips and jade tablets emerged from the Palace of the Numinous Capital of the Most High, carved from jade.

**Cinnabar Script and Ink Registers**
The *Canons of the Supreme Perfection* state: Cinnabar slips are vermilion-lacquered slips, signifying fire as the master of yang. Ink registers are script written in ink, signifying water as the master of yin. Those who study longevity and adhere to them shall not die. Thus, they are called *cinnabar slips and ink registers*, and are transmitted only in secret.

**Jade Tallies**
The Heavenly Sovereign wields the Flying Immortal’s Jade Tally; the Human Sovereign wields the Jade Tally of the Highest Sovereign’s Preservation of Life; the Earthly Sovereign wields the Jade Tally of the Primordial Sovereign’s Determination of Records.

**The Book of Blessed Continuity**
The *Scripture of the Thirty-Nine Chapters* states: The Most High possesses the Gate of Jade Feathers, which coalesce to form an embryo. It is named Wang Xuan, the honored one of the three *qi*. The Primordial Elder is the guest of the Celestial Thearch, together supporting the myriad bodies. The Terrace of Spirits carves their names upon the slips of Blessed Continuity. It further states: The Most High’s golden slips and jade tablets are the Book of Blessed Continuity.

**Jade and Coral Script**
The *Feathered Scripture of Flight* states: Gold script and jade registers are the Jade and Coral Script.

**White Silver’s Compilation**
The *Scripture of the Golden Chamber’s Life-Prolonging Arts* states: In the Palace of the Numinous Capital of the Great Constant, there are the arts of the Golden Chamber for prolonging life and reversing the years. All are cast in gold slips, inscribed on white silver’s compilation, and written in purple ink.

**Red Script**
The *Scripture of the Jade Essentials* states: The Primordial Beginning’s Red Script of the Five Chapters of True Writ is placed with the Five Thearchs, guided by yin and yang. It turns the pivot of the Nine Heavens and revolves the radiance of the Five Stars.

**Fire-Refined True Script**
The *Scripture of Fundamental Forms* states: In the first year of the Red Brightness, I and the Highest Great Sage, the Jade Thearch, refined this true script in this land, using fire to illuminate and reveal its characters. At that time, the true script’s fire overflowed, and *qi* arose elsewhere, transforming into a forest of the Seven Treasures. Thus, its branches and leaves became purple script on a golden ground with silver engravings and jade characters. Within it were all manner of dragons, birds, fierce beasts, and divine insects. Constantly feeding on the forest’s dew and absorbing the true *qi* into their bodies, their lives were prolonged. After thirty million kalpas, when their terms ended, they all transformed into flying immortals, ceaselessly following the Dao, thereby attaining the true and effortless Dao.

**Characters of the Golden Flask’s Ink**

**The *Shengji* states:** In the kingdom of Futi, two scribes of virtuous script were presented, now old, now young. When they concealed their forms, shadows appeared; when their voices were heard, their forms vanished. At times, they produced a four-inch golden flask, sealed with a lock of five dragons and bound with green clay. Within the flask was ink as thick as lacquer, which, when sprinkled upon wood or stone, transformed into characters of seal script, clerical script, and tadpole script, recording the origins of creation and human relations.

The Venerable Lord composed Daoist scriptures totaling one hundred thousand words, all transcribed onto jade tablets, bound with golden cords, and stored in jade cases. When the ink in the golden flask was exhausted, the two from Futi wished to cut open their hearts and drip their blood to replace the ink.

**The *Jade Clarity Hidden Book of the Golden Tiger Talisman* states:** The crimson script of Yu Yi summons the sun to share its chariot; the yellow chapters of Jie Lin dwell with the moon.

**The *Upper Clarity Scripture for Dispelling Demons* states:** Open the cavern gate in the Grove of Rarities, seek the numinous traces in the Cinnabar Grotto. Unseal the vermilion coffer of the Primordial Heaven, gaze upon the jade tablets of the Upper Clarity. The mysterious script is already engraved on jade tablets, and the crimson names are first inscribed at the Numinous Portal. Four encounters with the Three Origins in the Mysterious Palace, six visitations to the Five Elders in the Numinous Chamber.

**The *Eight Simplicities Scripture* states:** The Eight Simplicities True Scripture’s mysterious script arises within the Great Void, appearing on the Western Tortoise Mountain, above the Dark Garden, and beneath the Shaded Face of the Accumulated Stones.

**The *Eight Simplicities Lofty Mystery Feathered Chapters* states:** The numinous script is dense upon the Cavern’s summit; the purple characters gleam in the Jade Grove. Divine radiance streams its brilliance through the Nine Origins; the golden tones resonate emptily in the Purple Heaven. The majesty of the script blazes forth; *qi* spreads across the Purple Court. The assembled perfected ones offer obeisance, celebrating the Upper Clarity.

**The *Jade Thearch’s Seven Sages Mysterious Record* states:** Then, turning the Nine Empyreans, white tablets and azure records were presented. The Supreme Sage Lord received them in the Nine Empyreans, weaving the flying mysterious purple *qi* into characters of spontaneity. The mysterious record inscribed the names of later students who attained the Dao. The numinous sounds harmonized, and the jade tones conveyed truth—sometimes through the form of the characters, sometimes through hidden tones. In the fourfold convergence above and below, all manifested the empty-born names of the mysterious, engraved in the Hall of Vast Numinosity.

The ancient script comprised one hundred thousand jade words, with no fixed forms for the characters and no standard sounds for the rhymes. None but the supreme sages could fathom their meaning. After seven thousand years, in the chamber of Kunlun and the source of the Northern Cavern, the characters grew to a *zhang* in size, their patterns resplendent and dazzling. Their fourfold convergence cast forth rays, dimly arising and vanishing as if present, as if absent. Streaming radiance and purple *qi* swept away their impurities; molten gold refined and illuminated their script. Thus, through countless kalpas, the forms of the characters became vivid.

On the seventeenth day of the ninth month in the first year of the Middle August Era, the Seven Sages, in unison with the numinous, assembled in the Palace of Purity and Equality. They swore celestial oaths to heaven, pledging their vows to the numinous, and received the numinous script. The Supreme Highest resolved their obstructions, and the Seven Sages comprehended its wondrous sounds. It was recorded as the *Turning Heaven’s Nine Empyreans: The Chapter on Attaining the Dao*, inscribed on white silver tablets with soaring azure script. It was stored in a cloud-brocade pouch, sealed with the Seal of Destiny’s Summons, and entrusted to the Left Celestial Duke of the Five Elders’ Immortal Capital for safekeeping in the Jade Palace.

**The *Jade Thearch’s Seven Sages Mysterious Record* states:** The Seven Sages’ Mysterious Record, the celestial script of Turning Heaven, is formed sometimes through rhyming harmony, sometimes through the mutual support of branches and categories, or through the fourfold convergence above and below to complete the sounds of the characters. Sometimes it marks the correct taboo names, or combines single and compound forms—all emerging from the ancient emptiness of the Lofty Cavern, compiled by the perfected ones to clarify the numinous script.

For later students who possess a mysterious name, upon seeing this script, their names are cut from the azure emptiness (initial *sou* angle), recorded by the Four Offices and inscribed by the Five Thearchs.

**The *Eight Simplicities Scripture* states:** In the Western Florescence Palace, there are *lang* tablets of budding script. Only those who become perfected ones may obtain this text.

**The *Three Caverns Pearl Satchel* states:** In the first year of the Supreme August Era, on the seventh month, the Queen Mother of the West taught in the Southern Floating Cavern Chamber, transmitting it to the Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness, Lord Wang, who passed it to Yu the Great. Yu sealed the script within the Southern Floating Cavern Chamber, in the stone *gong*.

(Note: The character *gong* 碽 is also written as such.) Thus, the *Five Talismans* states: "The numinous script of the Nine Heavens remains sealed within the stone *gong*." Upon examining the various character types, this *gong* character is not found.

The *Jade Instructions* (Lower Volume) states: "The true script of the Five Elders is sealed and titled with a jade *gong*." This is another example.

**Kong Lingfu’s *Records of Kuaiji* states:** South of Mount Kuaiji lies Mount Wanwei, atop which stands a stone locally called the Stone Basket. Its cliffs rise sheer into the clouds, and one must ascend by ladder to reach it. When Yu the Great regulated the floodwaters and his work was not yet complete, he fasted on this mountain. Opening the Stone Basket, he found golden tablets inscribed with characters, through which he understood the configurations of mountains and rivers. Thereupon, he dredged and guided the hundred streams, each according to its proper course.

**Script and Talisman Techniques:**
Withdraw the gaze and reverse the hearing; gather the thoughts and preserve sincerity. Let the heart be as the Great Void, inwardly and outwardly pure and bright. The Primordial Beginning is myself; I am the Primordial Beginning. Where intention goes, the brush moves—one *qi* completes the talisman.

If the strokes within the talisman differ slightly, do not be rigid; value instead the spontaneity of the brush, where the heart attains the wondrous.

However, in the Clear Subtlety tradition, the method of dashing strokes must distinguish between water and fire. For praying for rain or snow, performing water refinement, or treating yang illnesses, use the water brush. For praying for clear skies, summoning lightning, stirring thunder, dispelling epidemics, performing fire refinement, or treating yin conditions, use the fire brush. Employ the taboo names of the Three Heavens or the Five Thearchs as appropriate.

**The Five Chapters of the Most High’s Proclamation:**

**Eastern Azure Essence Flying Cloud Jade Chapter**
The Wood Duke, Mulberry Elder Azure August Lord,
White Prime Grand Unity, Left Unsurpassed Hero.

Gathering qi and assembling mist, he grasps the talismans and registers,
Separating the dead souls from the living bodies to distinguish the Perfected.
Commanding the flying clouds to nurture the Nine Qi,
Stooping to refine the Cavernous Wisdom of the spontaneous spirits.

**Southern Vermilion Script, Mysterious Essence Congealed Jade Chapter**
The Vermilion Mound and Southern Prosperity hold the Imperial Perfected,
Commanding and restraining the earthly deities to attend and escort.
Receiving refinement and rebirth, emerging from the Five Portals,
Forever departing the demonic palaces, the immortal Dao is accomplished.
Forcing the demonic hordes to converge, erasing the ledgers of sins,
Following the kalpas in revolution to extinguish the roots of evil.
The Han Controller records those who are delivered,
The myriad heavens strictly examine and guard the forms and hun-souls.
Ancestral kalpas, vast and distant, revolve the Great Net,
Jade Mountain and White Stone convene in the Upper Capital.
The Life-Favoring Han Lord extends the threads of destiny,
Delivering from calamity, restoring the bones, reviving the dead.
At every moment ascending beyond the Three Realms,
Carefree, he bows his head to the Jade Emperor.
Empty and Cavernous, spontaneously uniting with Brahma-qi,
The hun-soul and spirit become pure and upright, the body radiant with light.
Those who rely on life and death are all immediately delivered,
Countless generations of ancestors suffer no more.
Returning to form, roaming the vastness of the Great Void,
Receiving transformation and rebirth as noble beings.
The Crimson Thearch nurtures qi, circulating the constructive and defensive,
Neither born nor perishing, ensuring eternal existence.
The Three Qi soar and hurl the Fire Bells,

Alone he ascends in flight to feast in the Jade Capital.

**Western Flowing Essence, Spirit Flower Jade Chapter**
Flying Heaven blazes with brilliance, equal to the Celestial Balance,
The Luminous Elder of the Pristine Radiance commands the Yellow Warriors.
The myriad thearchs establish rites as the heavens sing,
Rivers and seas fall silent, mountains conceal the clouds.
Sun and moon halt their wheels, uniting the Three Luminaries,
The Jade Armillary and stellar constellations align with the Eight Classics.
The hordes of demons and ghostly essences extinguish their forms and vitality,
Returning corpses to life, bones become human.
Penetrating the mysterious and investigating the subtle, mastering all chapters,
Flowing radiance stirs the distant spirit flowers.
The myriad Dao lineages and ancestral origins, great and carefree,
Graceful and resplendent, their virtue is unmatched.
The Golden Watchtower and Jade Capital, chambers of yin and yang,
The Mysterious Vastness and towering peaks, the jeweled terraces shine.
Through corpse liberation, returning to form, exhausting the workings of creation,
The Nine Palaces thoroughly penetrate, inhaling the Golden Effulgence.
Cavernously resplendent in three hues—azure, yellow, and white,
Within and without, flourishing and obscure, the form, qi, and spirit.
The White Thearch attends the po-soul, fortifying and guarding,
The Azure Empyrean suspends pearls to guide the wondrous Perfected.
Restraining dragons and tigers, the auspicious clouds manifest might,
In an instant, silent resonance delivers heaven and humanity.
Encountering the scriptures and Dharma, all receive salvation,
Preserving their original years, all cultivate good hearts.
Forever delivering from the Three Paths and Five Sufferings,
Passing through the barriers of the myriad heavens, the demon kings submit.
Supervision and promotion are unrestrained by the Celestial Gates’ system,
The Three Realms and Five Thearchs declare the Highest Clarity.

**Northern Purple Register, Mysterious Darkness Jade Chapter**
Primordial subtlety returns to color, yet no form remains,
Total qi pervades the Net of Heaven, vast and boundless, the Supreme Mystery.
His nape bears white light, forming the Nine Images,
Primordial Azure unfolds transformation, boundless and profound.
The Mysterious Darkness Duke bestows the Perfected Talismans,
The Grand Unity Primordial Lord oversees the ranks of immortals.
Crimson radiance and vermilion auspices dance with the embryonic immortals,
Flying chariots and jade hues shine upon the Mushroom Fields.
Nine dragons rear their heads, spitting fire pearls,
The Dark Tortoise spews flames, vomiting golden lotuses.
The nation is secure, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great peace,
The earth becomes azure jade, linked with the Dipper.
Sun, moon, and stellar lodges revolve the Jade Balance,
Divine winds fall silent, mountains swallow the mist.
Flying Heaven gazes down upon the chiming of jade,
Dark Wisdom and Heavenly Perfected unite with spontaneity.
Roaming the Three Realms, entering the Golden Gate,
Revolving without cessation, calamities do not approach.
The Black Thearch circulates blood, flowing through the meridians,
Centering and regulating the Five Qi, penetrating the hundred rivers.
Thirty-five divisions revolve the Five Constants,
The primordial net flows and evolves, the Winnowing Basket and Dipper turn.
Passing through the Wind Marsh and Vajra Heaven,
The cosmic order nourishes and generates the myriad qi in full.
Nine Harmonies and Ten Unions enable transformation,
At dawn’s flight, bowing before the Jade Emperor.

**Central Flying Flower, Total Cloud Jade Chapter**
Congealing essence, flying flowers with eight-pointed rays,
Vast and surging, the Great Void radiates the Chamber of Radiance.
The hundred demons conceal their rhymes, the qi of the Numinous Treasure,
Spontaneously uniting and parting, planting yin and yang.
The Non-Ultimate Supreme Perfected is the root of heaven,
Vast and distant, the kalpas’ peaks seem as if existing or perishing.
The great circulation of Brahma-qi pervades the ten directions,
The immeasurable mysteries are difficult to detail.
The Supreme Elder of Total Spirit grasps the Five Dippers,
Sternly commanding the Northern Feng to sweep away inauspiciousness.
The vast Brahma of the Primordial Abyss revolves the Crimson Clarity,
The boundless Dragon Han records the Extended Prosperity.
The Thirty-Two Heavens follow the seasonal measures,
Thus composing the Five Chapters to guard the emperors.
Commanding the myriad heavens with the might of the Eight Radiances,
Reversing death to create life, preserving the Supreme Yang.
The Three Primordial Purple Mists circulate above and below,
The Yellow Thearch, Central Lord, summons the Returning Yellow.
The Muddy Pellet and Crimson Palace unite the hundred spirits,
Gathering the hun-soul and returning the po-soul without hindrance or misfortune.
Overseeing the host of spirits, grasping the Great Dipper,
The Azure Empyrean’s empty songs praise the Dharma King.
The myriad heavens’ great sages together proclaim goodness,
Preserving their original years, free from harm.
Delivering those on the verge of death, reviving the extinguished,
Transcending the Formless to merge with the Supreme Thearch.
The myriad immortals assist and protect, accomplishing the Supreme Dao,
The karmic conditions of past lives may then be fulfilled.

**Record of the Three Caverns’ Divine Talismans concludes.**
