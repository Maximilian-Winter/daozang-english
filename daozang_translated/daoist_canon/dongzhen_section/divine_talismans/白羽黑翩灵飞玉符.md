The White Feather, Black Quill, Numinous Flying Jade Talisman:
The Primordial Father and Mother of the Nine Heavens, and the Great Perfected Lord, together feasted in the radiant dragon chariot, accompanied by the myriad hosts of the Mulberry Grove—countless perfected ones and flying immortals, riding cloud-wheels swift as lightning, their bodies moving in harmony with the Dao, singing sacred verses. They roamed the cavern of the Dark Mound, rested by the limpid waves, wandered the Purple Void’s palace, and halted their chariots at the boundless edge.

At that moment, the celestial origin shone resplendent; the five dawns revolved their light, the Three Pristine Ones coursed through the clouds, purple mists exhaled fragrance, flying incense encircled the sun, and its rich scent dispersed into the Great Void. Radiant blossoms intertwined, the Three Candles merged their brilliance, congealing the true and ascending in union. They chewed the root of the sun, consumed the mysterious to infuse the void, unfurled the luminous golden scriptures, and intoned the nine subtleties, their numinous harmony resonating like jade.

The chariot’s marvelous thought stirred the Great Stillness, and inner contemplation arose from spontaneity. In the first year of the Supreme August Era, on the third day of the third month, at the dawn of the Primordial Beginning, suddenly a numinous presence descended in a white simurgh’s chariot, a black-quilled phoenix in its beak holding a plain scroll—the *Flying Feather Scripture* and the *True Formula for Treading the Void*. Jade essence and flying immortals guided the mist, while hosts of spirits guarded the divine. They alighted above the nine heavens, resplendent in the Jade Void’s court, descending before the Great Perfected. The Mysterious One bestowed the precious scripture.

On that day, the Great Perfected Lord had just completed his retreat in the Supreme Clarity. The Celestial Thearch, the Three Pristine Primordial Ladies of Purple Tenuity, the Heavenly Thearch, the Celestial Thearch of the Supreme Tenuity, and the august guests of the Most High Jade Emperor all descended together. They burned incense of a hundred harmonies, arranged the floating jade seats of the five-colored divine officials, and arrayed their ranks in the Purple Palace. The assembled perfected ones paid homage to the scripture, circumambulating thrice. The Three Pristine Primordial Ladies rose, facing west, and intoned in a resonant, mysterious voice the *Ode of Celebrating the Feathered Perfected*, in praise of the divine scripture:

*"Mists gather in the Great Void’s hall,
Numinous winds scatter rare fragrance.
Soughing, the dark radiance ascends,
Gentle breezes wing the sun.
The white simurgh swiftly flies with the phoenix,
Its beak holding the divine feathered scripture.
Fluttering, they soar through the nine heavens,
Their mournful cries summoning the dark beam.
The wondrous formula takes flight through the void,
The pure governance of the Dao knows no end.
All perfected ones universally rejoice,
Bowing their heads in homage to the Jade Emperor."*

The recitation concluded.

The Grand Thearch then rose, facing north, and intoned:

*"The dark phoenix swiftly soars on cloud-wings,
Startled white, it rejoices in hesitation.
Flying fragrance blends with radiant splendor,
Streaming light illumines the cloud thoroughfare.
The great dragon reins its long bridle,
Flying immortals mutually support one another.
Myriad perfected ones celebrate auspicious joy,
The joyous phoenix roams the empty center.
The Primordial Beginning leaves no trace,
Yet dark resonance naturally seeks itself.
Fluttering feathers require no chariot,
Drifting, it rides the mist and floats.
The treasure scripture weaves the dark warp,
Its fivefold essence governs the numinous talismans.
Celebrating, they pay homage in the court of blessings,
Circumambulating thrice with incense."*

The recitation concluded.

The Heavenly Thearch rose, facing east, and intoned:

*"Pale feathers mottled with dark pinions,
Riding the floating, they descend and revolve.
Flowing fragrance overflows the ten heavens,
Fragrant mushrooms luxuriate in the Grand Tenuity.
The numinous scripture reveals hidden mechanisms,
The feathered scripture radiates dark brilliance.
The supreme Dao is fundamentally without obscurity,
Holding to the true, the luminous scene flies of itself."*

This recitation concluded.

The Grand Perfected Elder, clad in ritual vestments, wore the *Limitless Three Treasures Jade Crown of the Utmost Heaven*, and the *Seamless Nine-Colored Flying Void Radiant Feathered Scripture Robe*. At his left side hung a tinkling bell, and at his right, the *Seven Primes*. He prostrated facing due south.

The Grand Tenuity Heavenly Thearch rose and commanded the Feathered Immortal Attendant to hold aloft a golden tray and present the scripture. Facing north, he knelt in reverence and offered it to the Grand Perfected. All immortals acclaimed it as excellent.

The Grand Perfected stood to receive the scripture, his countenance emitting golden light. From his fivefold essence naturally arose the *Numinous Flying Jade Talismans*.

Ascending with the assembled perfected ones, he boarded the *White Simurgh Chariot*, drawn by *Black-Pinioned Phoenixes*, to feast in *Eternal Radiance*. To the east, they journeyed to the *Azure Grove and Jasper Waters*, the *Mound of Fusang*, and the *Nine Springs’ Mouth*; to the west, the *Dark Feathered Pale Wilds* and the *Bank of Mengsi*; to the south, the *Crimson Mound’s Utmost Fire Essence* and the *Southern Summer’s Town*; to the north, the *Northern Darkness’ Cavernous Dark Hall* and the *Frigid Waters’ Land*; at the center, the *Ten Absolute Peaks of Yellow Qi and Yang Essence*, the *Grand Dark Jade Capital*, the *Golden Terrace and Jade Chamber*, the *Cinnabar Palace*—roaming the ten heavens, the eight domains, and the caverns of purity. Governing the countless perfected ones, there was no heaven beyond his reach, no hidden realm beyond his purview, no qi beyond his command, no immortal beyond his embrace. Universally ruling the host of spirits, from heaven downward, none failed to model their virtue upon the Grand Perfected or revere the *Feathered Scripture*.

Thereupon, each Thearch floated to the *Dark Palace*, where across seven thousand kalpas the scripture was transmitted to the *Most High Great Dao Lord*.

The *Upper Numinous Flying Jade Talisman*—the *Dark Immortal Feathered Essence’s Natural Scripture*—when worn for seven years, enables one to ride the void and fly, ascending to the *Seven Primes*. Practicing the *Feathered Scripture’s Flying Paces Dao*, without this talisman one cannot ride the void to ascend the dark. The recipient pledges ninety feet of azure brocade to heaven. On the day of ascetic practice, the talisman is inscribed upon the left palm; one then grasps the *Azure Radiance* and takes flight. Inscribed on a nine-inch piece of azure silk and worn at the left elbow, the *Six Jia Twelve Spirits* and *Twelve Numinous Flying Jade Maidens* attend on the left.

The *Lower Numinous Flying Jade Talisman*—the *Primordial Beginning’s Essence, Dark Feathered Jade Scripture*—when worn for nine years, enables one to ride the void and fly, ascending to the *Five Stars*. Practicing the *Flying Paces Ascending Dark Dao*, without this talisman one cannot ride the void. The recipient pledges sixty feet of white brocade to heaven. On the day of ascetic practice, the talisman is inscribed upon the right palm; one then grasps the *Pale Numinous* and takes flight. Inscribed on a nine-inch piece of white silk and worn at the right elbow, the *Six Jia Twelve Spirits* and *Twelve Numinous Flying Jade Maidens* attend on the right.

The *Left Numinous Flying Jade Talisman*—the *Dark Qi’s First-Born Essence, Pale Feathered Scripture*—when worn for nine years, enables one to ride the void and fly, ascending to the *Five Stars*. Practicing the *Flying Paces Ascending Dark Dao*, without this talisman one cannot tread the clouds to ascend the dark. The recipient pledges eighty feet of cinnabar brocade to heaven. On the day of ascetic practice, the talisman is inscribed upon the sole of the left foot; one then treads the void and takes flight. Inscribed on a nine-inch piece of crimson silk and worn at the left elbow, the *Six Jia Twelve Spirits* and *Twelve Numinous Flying Jade Maidens* attend before.

The *Right Numinous Flying Jade Talisman*—the *Primordial Qi’s Essence, Ascending Dark Feathered Scripture*—when worn for nine years, enables one to ride flying clouds and walk the *Jade Purity*. Practicing the *Flying Paces Dao*, without this talisman one cannot tread the *Seven Primes* to ascend the void. The recipient pledges fifty feet of dark brocade to heaven. On the day of ascetic practice, the talisman is inscribed upon the sole of the right foot; one then treads the dark and takes flight. Inscribed on a nine-inch piece of black silk and worn at the right elbow, the *Six Jia Twelve Spirits* and *Twelve Numinous Flying Jade Maidens* attend behind.

The *Grand Numinous Flying Jade Talisman*—the *Yang Qi’s Yellow Essence, Flying Feathered Scripture*—when worn for nine years, one’s countenance emits golden light, and one may sit or stand in disappearance, flying through the Great Void. Practicing the *Flying Paces Dao*, without this talisman one cannot ascend to the *August Keeper* or transcend to the *Nine Darks*. The recipient pledges twelve feet of yellow brocade to heaven. On the day of ascetic practice, the talisman is inscribed upon the heart; one then exhales qi to form clouds and rides them in flight. Inscribed on a nine-inch piece of yellow silk and worn at the left elbow, the *Six Jia Twelve Spirits* and *Twelve Numinous Flying Jade Maidens* attend the body.

In all practices of meditative visualization upon the *Seven Stars’ Dao*, one must first ingest the five talismans before inscribing them. When inscribing or ingesting, face east, click the teeth twelve times, and recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Dark Void, Purple Purity,
Flying Feathered Scripture,
Above, it illumines clouds and rosy dawn,
Below, it commands the thousand numina.
Reining and guiding the Six Jia,
It transports my bodily form,
Flying paces to the Heavenly Prime,
Ascending to gather the Dipper’s essence.
Congealing the hun and solidifying the po,
Internally filling and replenishing,
Exiting the void and entering the dark,
Ever-generating with the qi."*

Upon completion, ingest the talisman, inscribe it upon the heart, and then proceed. After nine years of such practice, one may ride the void and command the clouds, flying through the *Great Purity*.

The *Left and Right Numinous Flying Jade Talismans* emerge from the *Qi of Nature*, darkly bestowed upon the Grand Perfected to ascend the void and tread the emptiness, ride the *Keeper* and tread the warp, entwining the *Seven Darks*, ascending the *Jade Purity’s Dao*—completing the *Flying Feathered Scripture*. Those who attain it become divine immortals; those who wear it become perfected persons; those who cultivate it summon the *White Simurgh Chariot* and *Black-Pinioned Phoenix* to welcome their bodies, ascending to the *Jade Palace* and roaming to feast in *Eternal Radiance*.

The *Most High Lord of the Great Dao* transmitted this to the *Supreme Primordial Lord of Grand Simplicity* and the *Celestial Thearch of the Grand Tenuity*, to be practiced until the Dao is perfected. It is concealed within the *Numinous Capital Palace of the Most High*. According to the statutes, it is transmitted once every three thousand years; it must not be lightly disclosed. To reveal the *Celestial Perfected* or breach the covenant and oath is to consign oneself to servitude under the *Ghostly Bureaucracy*, bringing calamity upon nine generations and eternal confinement in the *Dark Springs*. Here ends the *White Simurgh and Black-Pinioned Numinous Flying Jade Talisman*.
