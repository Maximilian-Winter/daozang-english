*The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Five Registers of the Cavernous True Prime: Five Register Talismans*

The Five Spirits of the Great One present the Five Talismans and Five Registers, invoking the Dao of the Imperial Lord’s fusion and union, seeking the formula for longevity and transcendence as divine immortals.

The Five Inner Treasure Talismans embody the Dao of the Great One’s Imperial Lord—fusion and union with the luminous radiance. On one’s life-day, inscribe the Five Talismans, store them together in a brocade pouch, and carry them to attain longevity and deathlessness.

Furthermore, in the month of one’s life-day, during the hour of one’s life-day within that month, enter a chamber, inscribe the Five Talismans, face the north, and ingest them. Upon completion, recite the incantation:
*"The Five Spirits of the Great One record the year of birth,
A thousand years, ten thousand ages—lifespan equal to Heaven’s.
The Imperial Lord grasps the talisman,
Life’s mandate stands firm, unshaken."*

If desiring to ingest these talismans repeatedly, the most auspicious times are the night hours of the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the ninth day of the ninth month.

**Five Registers: Five Talismans of Fusion and Transformation Guaranteeing Life**
The talisman on the right is inscribed in blue-green on white paper.
The talisman on the right is inscribed with orpiment on white paper.
The talisman on the right is inscribed in cinnabar on white paper.
The Right Talisman of the Great One for Governing the Three Hun and Seven Po.
The Right Talisman of the Great One’s Treasure Spirit for Summoning the Imperial Lord: On the eight solar terms’ midday hours, inscribe in vermilion on white paper, ingest, and upon completion, recite the incantation:
*"The Three Mysteries of the Supreme,
The Imperial Lord resides in the hun.
The Five Numinous Spirits of the Great One,
Guard the hun and pacify the body.
Within the Purple Chamber, the mandate is bestowed,
Commanding and restraining the hundred spirits."*

The Imperial Lord’s Great One’s Inner Spirit Talismans, comprising twelve sections, are all the primordial qi of the Supreme’s original essence—utterly true, utterly secret, and not to be transmitted recklessly.

Additionally, there exists an *Outer Formula of the Great One*, whose talismanic script differs greatly; these are all derived from the *Upper Text of the Scripture of the Flourishing Imperial Luminance of the Central Girdle*. Without the authentic version, their use will be ineffective. Practitioners must revere and exercise utmost caution.

The Right Talisman of the Imperial Lord Great One for Unbinding the Three Passes and Twelve Embryonic Knots: On one’s life-day or the eight solar terms, when intending to perform the unbinding of knots, first swallow three of these talismans, face the direction of one’s life-star, and inscribe with true cinnabar on the white membrane within a green bamboo’s solid node. The hollow center thus receives the numinous, and the script on the bamboo membrane serves as the text for unbinding the knots.

Here ends *The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Five Registers of the Cavernous True Prime: Five Register Talismans*.
