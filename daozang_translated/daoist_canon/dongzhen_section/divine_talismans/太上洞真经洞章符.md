### **The Cavern Talismans of the Supreme Cavern Perfection Scripture**

The Cavern Talismans are as follows:

The Three Qi of the Supreme transform into divine talismans, named the *Boundless Cavern Talismans of the Three Origins*. They command the Six Jia, mobilize the Five Phases, govern separation and reunion, reverse death and restore life. They dispel the Three Ghosts and purify the Five Spirits.

The Five Spirits are also called the Five Corpses; the Three Ghosts are also called the Three Worms. Worms and corpses are alternate names—when the spirits are disordered and the ghosts chaotic, they dwell within the human body, inciting evil deeds.

On auspicious days and propitious hours, one reports to the Mysterious Bureau. The Supreme issues a mandate, ordering all celestial deities to seize and restrain the corpse-ghosts, impeaching human transgressions. The Director of Destinies examines and calculates, demoting the foolish and promoting the worthy.

The worthy ascend to study, purifying themselves through fasting and cultivation. They abandon evil and practice goodness, restraining the corpse-ghosts. They eradicate baleful qi and draw in auspicious spirits.

Those who receive and wear the talismans must hold them in mind and contemplate them within. The Great Unity descends with the divine name *Inscribed in the Register of Life*, forever freeing one from the sorrows of the Nine Earths and eternally preserving the joy of the Three Clarities.

### **Declaration for the Cavern Talisman**

On the [day] of the [month] in the year of [Tai Sui], at the hour of [time], your humble servant, [name], of [prefecture, county, village], [personal name], declares:

By the threads of former lives, blessings have infused my essence. Revolving through the Nine Heavens, my fortune flows unbroken. Having attained the *Mysterious Cavern Scripture* and refined the subtle arts, I fear the Three Worms remain unpurged and the Five Corpses bring illness.

I reverently request the secret Cavern Talismans to extinguish the corpse-worms, erase death and inscribe life, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Supreme Perfected.

**The Three Corpses:** Upper Corpse, Middle Corpse, Lower Corpse.
**The Five Corpses:** Green Corpse, Red Corpse, White Corpse, Black Corpse, Yellow Corpse.
May the Three Corpses and Five Corpses all descend into the Yellow Springs.

I ascend to the Azure Heavens to preserve long life, joy without end, and dwell as a Heavenly King for generation upon generation.

**Secret Incantation for the Five Corpses (to be recited silently each morning):**

Left: Wu Ying. Right: Bai Yuan. Center: Director of Destinies. Above: Great Unity. Below: Tao Kang.
Bind the spirit and essence, gather the hun and po, extend the years of life, stabilize the hundred spirits, augment the essence and qi, erase the mark of death, rectify the name of life.

The Five Elders transmit the talismanic registers; the Five Numinous Ones present the Cavern Talismans.
Upholding me, they wander carefree, feasting in the Jade Capital.

### **Five Vital Talismanic Strategies**

**First:** *Talismanic Strategy for Preserving the Spirit and Prolonging Life.*
On one’s life-day, at midday, write in cinnabar on green paper, making two copies. At midnight, enter a chamber, complete the visualization, face one’s life-direction, and ingest one copy. Cut the talisman from top to bottom along the black dots. Place the left half into the stove fire and the right half into well water. Regularly performing this on one’s life-day ensures the Celestial Emperor records one’s life contract.

**Second:** *Talismanic Strategy for Undying Flight to Immortality.*
On one’s life-day at dawn, write in green ink on white paper and ingest while facing east.

**Third:** *Talismanic Strategy for Eradicating Corpses and Stabilizing Life.*
On one’s life-day at midday, write in cinnabar on white paper and ingest one copy while facing south.

**Fourth:** *Talismanic Strategy for Recording Years and Stabilizing Form.*
On one’s life-day at dusk, write in cinnabar on white paper and ingest while facing one’s life-direction.

**Fifth:** *Talismanic Strategy for Restraining the Hun-Po and Treasuring Life.*
On the life-month, life-day, and life-hour, write in cinnabar on white paper and ingest while facing north. If the life-month, day, or hour is unknown, ingest on the day of *wu-wu* at midday.

The Five Registers and Five Talismans must be ingested according to the method and worn while traveling. The term "strategy" denotes the talisman; cultivation depends on precision. When names are inscribed in the Jade Calendar, the Five Spirits descend with numinosity, ascending together to the Mysterious Ultimate.

**General Instructions for Incantations, Refinement, Qi Regulation, Spirit Pacification, and Demon Repulsion:**

Before visualization, knock the teeth and rouse one’s might, alerting and admonishing within and without. First, silently recite the *Incantation for Eradicating Evil*:

*"The Yellow Center wields qi to sever the root of demons,
Scrutinizing and restraining strong essence, cutting off the old fiend.
The Supreme issues a mandate from the Supreme Chamber,
Urging the Northern Emperor to hasten to the Jade Palace.
Reverently bearing the mighty decree, proclaiming to the Demon Kings,
The Nine Qi billow and clash with destiny.
The secret Jade Texts flourish in perfection,
The Three Heavens revolve in brightness, the Six Heavens in completion.
How worthy!"*

After reciting the secret incantation, proceed to chant the scriptures. Otherwise, myriad evils will assail the superior adept. Diligently practicing this ensures demonic spirits respect and protect.

If ingesting, carrying, or wearing talismans, and failing to recite the incantations, simply silently recite this one before ingesting or wearing as desired.

**Supreme Heavenly Worthy, grasping the handle of the Dipper.**
Where it points, destruction follows; where it descends, misfortune befalls.
Aiding the good and punishing the evil, descending to receive the pure and true.
Five Numinous Ones attend in guard; divine officials array in formation.
The recipient must visualize and remember clearly, never forgetting.
After three years, they will personally behold the august deities.

In the year of [X] under the reign of the Great Year-Star, in the [X] month at the hour of the Mother of [X], in the state, commandery, county, village, and hamlet of [X], [male/female] of [Name], aged [X] years.

Invoking the Talisman of the Boundless Grand Marshal and the Five Numinous Five Martial Spirits, wear it to repel weapons.

Evil persons upon seeing me shall have their hearts crushed and gallbladders shattered.
Ghosts and spirits upon seeing me shall prostrate and dare not rise.
The talisman smites demonic altars and shatters temples, severing the Six Heavens.
All remaining spirits, myriad specters, and malevolent entities within the villages, communities, and domains—upon seeing this talisman borne by me—shall come forth to pay homage and bow.

Respectfully upholding and enacting the true talisman, all as decreed by the Most High Lord Lao.

Wear it; inscribe its form but do not inscribe the right-hand annotations.

**Talisman of the Great Unity for Upholding Life and Prolonging Years:**
As follows.

In the year of [X] under the reign of the Great Year-Star, on the [X] day of the [X] month at the hour of [X], in the state, commandery, county, village, and hamlet of [X], [male/female] of [Name].
Devoted to the Dao and delighting in life, a descendant of the Most High.
As recorded in the Jade Register of Immortals, under the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars.
In these times of peril, with the world beset by evil and malevolent forces,
Should they assail one’s person, I fear I may not safely pass through.
I hereby receive the Talisman of the Great Unity for Upholding Life and Prolonging Years, to guard and protect myself.
After receiving the talisman, in all movements, comings, and goings, the bearer shall know no distress.
Demonic specters, ghostly thieves—upon seeing the talisman—shall immediately prostrate and hide.
The true officials of the land shall all escort and welcome, none daring to disobey.

Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the talisman’s original decree and the statutes and commands!

Thus concludes the *Dongzhen Scripture* and the talismanic chapters of the *Dongzhang*.
