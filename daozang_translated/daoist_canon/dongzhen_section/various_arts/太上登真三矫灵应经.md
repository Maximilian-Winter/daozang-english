For all who study and cultivate the Dao of immortality, encountering the *Three Transmutations Scripture* enables entry into the wondrous Dao. It differs from all other methods and arts: when applied, it is swift as spark from stone, erected amidst mist and radiance, deployed like lightning—hastening one’s journey to the immortal isles.

The *Three Transmutations* are these: above, the *Dragon Transmutation*; at the center, the *Tiger Transmutation*; below, the *Deer Transmutation*. Those who face this teaching hold the hidden and secret scripture of the *Upper Clarity* palace.

In general, the Dao of immortal cultivation—when employing the *Dragon Transmutation*—allows one to ascend to heaven and descend into earth, to penetrate mountains and enter waters. Without this art, even spirits and gods cannot fathom it. It aids the devotee of the Dao, merging with the profound and obscure, and communing with the Great Dao.

The *Dragon Transmutation* is qi. Qi is the Dao. By gazing long upon the *Dragon Transmutation*, refining the body into qi, and uniting with the Dao in truth, one’s feet shall birth clouds. The *Dragon Transmutation* ensures that devotees of the Dao, when journeying to grotto-heavens and blessed lands, find no demon, specter, or malevolent entity daring to draw near. Wherever they traverse mountains, rivers, or prefectures, the local spirits come forth in audience.

Master Sun the Perfected said: “This method is most efficacious.”

The *Tiger Transmutation* is the mother of wind and the child of water. When practiced for three years, the tiger rides the wind to come and go, swift as withered leaves borne aloft by the breeze—gathering to form a shape, scattering to become wind, merging with the pure yang qi of heaven and earth into perfect oneness.

Master Liezi said: “If I cultivate this method, I shall naturally attain the Dao.” Those who receive it hereafter must not lightly disclose or leak it.

The *Deer Transmutation* is the constant Way. It aids devotees of the Dao, enabling them to travel a thousand *li* in a day. When encountering deer, one may gather magic mushrooms, for the deer naturally discerns their location and distance. Wherever the deer arrives at a place with magic mushrooms, after circling thrice, the mushrooms cannot flee. By harvesting and consuming them according to the method, one obtains the magic mushrooms and attains immortality without death. Without this method, the magic mushrooms cannot be ingested.

The scriptures of the Three Transmutations are the numinous texts of heaven and earth, the secret arts of divine immortals. If transmitted to the unworthy, one first brings calamity upon oneself, then annihilates nine generations of ancestors. An oath must be sworn before imparting them to those of virtue.

**Entering the Method**
For those who practice the *Deer Transmutation*, first bathe in fragrant water for three days. Then, on the night of an *jiǎzǐ* or *gēngshēn* day at midnight, set up a small altar—regardless of size or height—with one lamp, one incense burner, three flowers, and eighty-one stalks of white cogon grass spread upon it. Place seven peach leaves, then light the incense and declare: “Disciple of [prefecture, subprefecture, county], [name], by nature inclined toward purity and emptiness, yearns for the Great Dao. Now I beseech the Great Emperor of the Dipper to grant a mist-and-cloud white deer to assist my cultivation, accumulate merit, and save sentient beings.” Then take a talisman of the Jade Emperor, hold it in the mouth, and recite the incantation seven times:

*White deer, white deer, bearing flowers and fruit,*
*The Jade Emperor commands you to come to my home.*
*Hasten, hasten, as the law commands!*

After reciting the incantation, banish all distracting thoughts and focus the mind entirely on envisioning oneself as the Jade Emperor. Then imagine a white deer arriving on the altar from the void, bearing flowers and fruit. Receive the flowers and fruit, and with the hand, regulate the breath. After twenty-four breaths, the deer is complete; then dismiss the vision.

Practice this for thirty days, imagining the white deer resting within one’s embrace upon the ground. After eighty-one breaths, dismiss it. After forty-nine days of full practice, maintain the vision for three days, and the deer will come and go within the hermitage. After thirty more days, one may freely roam the world, running as swiftly as a galloping horse, covering a thousand *li* in a day, traversing as if flying. Entering mountains to gather magic mushrooms, one moves without hindrance.

In general, when employing the *Deer Transmutation*, one must conceal it with an object. Use a bamboo pole: take fine bamboo, prepare a covering, and inscribe the character for “horse” upon it. Seal it within the bamboo, and the deer will be unable to see it. Ordinary people will perceive only a bamboo pole, while the practitioner alone sees a white deer. Alternatively, use white chaste tree wood, inscribe the character for “horse” upon it, and seal it—never letting others see it. When inscribing the character, first recite the previous incantation, envision the deer, draw in a breath of *qi*, and blow it upon the brush before writing.

**For the *Tiger Transmutation***
First observe a seven-day fast. On the night of a *gēngyín* day at midnight, establish an altar—square below and round above, twelve *chi* on each side, three *chi* in height—marking the boundary with ash. Place seven lamps upon it, one incense burner, seven portions of dried venison, and a handful of white cogon grass. Arrange everything properly, then light the incense and pray: “Disciple of [place], [name], by nature inclined toward purity and entering the Dao, now beseeches the Jade Emperor to grant a wind-cliff fierce tiger to serve as my mount, assisting my cultivation and delivering sentient beings.” Then take a talisman of the Jade Emperor, hold it in the mouth, and recite the incantation:

*Mysterious mechanism of *gēng* and *xīn*, wind-tiger general,*
*By the Three Heavens’ decree, come to bear me.*
*Hasten, hasten, as the Jade Emperor’s law commands!*

After reciting the incantation, calm the mind, guard oneness, and exclude all external affairs. With gentle, unbroken breath, focus the mind and envision a white tiger arriving from the west upon the altar. Envision it, then stroke its crown with the hand. After forty-nine breaths, dismiss the vision. At night, proceed as before.

After sixty full days, a tiger will naturally come to one’s side. No other object is needed to control it, for heaven bestows the complete *qi*, and accomplishment comes naturally. Unaware, the body becomes light and rises over a hundred *zhang* from the earth—do not be startled or afraid. Roam the great void and journey to grotto-heavens and blessed lands; demons, specters, and heterodox entities dare not interfere. Wherever one goes, local spirits will come forth in audience.

If practiced for three years, the body naturally rides the wind, moving like withered leaves, merging with the Dao and uniting with the true *qi*. Master Liezi said: “If transmitted to the unworthy, one first destroys oneself, then brings calamity upon nine generations of ancestors.” This warning is not empty.

To summon the coiling dragon, one must choose the second day of the first lunar month, specifically an *jiǎyín* day. Draw the Eight Trigrams in their respective positions, arrange nine lamps, and prepare a wooden board of autumn wood, two *cun* and four *fen* in width (corresponding to the numbers of heaven and earth) and four *cun* and four *fen* in length. On the board, inscribe in cinnabar the six characters: "Jade Emperor, save my life and summon the dragon." Also, stamp the Jade Emperor’s seal in cinnabar on paper and affix it to the board. Place the board over a basin of water, and tie a mirror to it so that its reflection shines upon the water’s surface. Cut a red dragon from fine paper, nine *cun* in length, regardless of width, and place it at the center of the water, ensuring the surface remains undisturbed. The dragon must not drift onto the board; instead, use the mirror to reflect its form into the glass.

After reflection, recite the incantation:
*"Nine heavens, nine earths, enter my mirror.
Reflect and appear at once, ride the great void.
Refine my body whole, unite with the Dao and truth.
Hasten, hasten, as decreed by law and command!"*

Recite this incantation nine times while visualizing the red dragon on the water’s surface, riding like fiery clouds within the mirror. Perform this recitation once daily from the *jiǎyín* day in the first lunar month through the following six *jiǎ* days, completing nine uninterrupted recitations. Thereafter, the dragon may be freely commanded. For timing, the *chéng* or *kāi* days are most auspicious. When invoking the dragon, first recite the incantation nine times, then face south to draw nine breaths of *qi* into the abdomen.

Afterward, use the mirror to reflect the image, and a red dragon will instantly appear beneath you, roaming the eight directions, ascending to heaven and descending to earth, entering stone caves without obstruction, moving as freely as the great void. Neither water nor fire can harm you, and no poison will afflict you. To halt the dragon, it will sense your intent—stopping when you wish, rising when you command. Even a journey of ten thousand *li* will be as swift as a spark from flint. After eighty-one repetitions of this practice, the mirror and board will no longer be needed.

The mirror must be buried at the *xū* hour on a *bǐngwǔ* day in a *qián* (northwest) location, nine *cun* deep, and left undisturbed. The board should be buried at the *chǒu* hour on a *wùxū* day in the *Gōuchén* (center) courtyard, one *chi* and two *cun* deep. Thereafter, use only the Jade Emperor’s seal: stamp it in cinnabar on paper, burn the paper to ash, mix with well water, and consume it. After eighty-one days, when the *qi* is fully cultivated, write a green talisman and burn it with the seal. From then on, the dragon will arrive at your call without need of any implements.

If one rides the dragon for three years, they will unite with the Dao and true *qi*, coalescing into form when gathered and dissolving into *qi* when dispersed. Thus it is said: "Longevity aligns with the single *qi*, and life equals the great void." The ancient perfected ones all relied on this talismanic scripture to ascend to truth.

This text must not be recklessly transmitted. Those who carelessly reveal this celestial treasure to the unworthy will bring calamity upon seven generations of ancestors. Even those who guard it in secret must beware, for the consequences are no trifling matter. Hold it in reverence and preserve it well.

**Jade Emperor’s Seal Design**
Carve the seal from *léijīng* jujube wood for optimal efficacy. Begin on a *tiānhé* day, making it one *cun* and two *fen* square and nine *fen* thick. Complete the carving on a *chéng* day, then on a *gēngshēn* day at midnight, purify the space with incense, wine, and fruit offerings—no meat or strong flavors. Place the seal on an altar with nine lamps and a tablet inscribed with the Jade Emperor’s name. Perform the ritual until the *chǒu* hour, then store the seal in a yellow silk pouch.

When using the seal, follow the aforementioned method. After obtaining it, one must constantly aid the distressed, relieve suffering, assist the orphaned, the poor, the elderly, and the young, and show compassion to all in illness. Through such cultivation, divine efficacy will swiftly manifest.
