# 太玄朗然子进道诗

**Preface to *The Radiant One’s Poems on Advancing in the Dao***

I was born by the Zhang River, of a once-illustrious family, raised in the Confucian tradition, and even earned the title of provincial graduate. Yet I lament how fleeting this world is—swift as a loosed arrow, its time rushing like a cataract. Thus I withdrew to the gates of the Mysterious, my heart dwelling in the cap and coarse robe of the Dao. I grasped the subtle principles of the external elixir, its truths veiled in obscurity, and illuminated the inner qi, tracing the source of embryonic breathing. Though my efforts spanned less than a decade, others marveled at my agelessness, for my lifespan had already extended beyond five cycles—such was the awakening I experienced. Endowed with this spiritual insight, I could not remain silent. With reverence, I composed thirty poems, titling them *The Radiant One’s Poems*, offering them to fellow seekers. May distant minds perceive the sagely intent, for it is not remote—only men’s doubts obscure it.

Written in the twelfth lunar month of the *wuzǐ* year of the *Duangong* era of the Song, while residing at Tongxuan Abbey in Luoyang, on a moment of inspiration.

**The Radiant One’s Poems on Advancing in the Dao**
*By Liu Xiyue of Xiufeng*

**1.**
For decades, adrift in wine and folly,
each dawn I indulged, rising late from slumber.
Yet once the *Weilü* connects to the *Niwan* cavity,
the cinnabar turtle discerns the power of creation.
This cloud-scraping path must have its way—
how can man’s fate be left to Heaven?
Say not the Great Dao is hard to fathom—
’tis only fools who refuse to learn immortality.

**2.**
North and south I wandered for decades,
steeping myself in the Mysterious, silently cultivating truth.
I sought not the world’s endless treasures,
only a true man within this mortal realm.
The external medicine’s fire and timing now clear,
the inner elixir ever circulates, tracing the flowing ford.
Even if we meet again in a thousand years,
you’ll find my countenance ever renewed.

**3.**
In the quietude of Luoyang’s ancient abbey,
I dwell where old moats hem in the past.
Worldly passions may taint, yet my heart remains unstained;
though entangled in mundane affairs, my Dao differs.
Why shun the thousand days’ toil of elixir-refining?
I constantly refine essence, keeping the four limbs unobstructed.
Of all things under Heaven, none is so precious—
save the human body, all else is emptiness.

**4.**
Seekers of immortality swarm in chaos,
traversing mountains and rivers like drifting clouds.
All pursue longevity through external things—
who has truly heard the Supreme Dao?
Within this body lies the path to Heaven’s ascent;
who lacks the mark of transcendence upon their back?
Alas for the common folk, utterly unenlightened,
content to rot in wild graves as barrows.

**5.**
Neither wealth nor rank do I prize—
pity those who come into this world thus bound.
In the cinnabar field, I sow the herbs of longevity;
in the Purple Palace, embers of death never kindle.
My marrow brims, indifferent to cold or heat;
once the Dao is perfected, why fear dawn or dusk?
Yet the world toils ceaselessly, chasing gain and fame,
their natures growing ever more dull.

**6.**
Drunk in bliss, all cares dissolved,
petals bloom and fade as spring and autumn pass.
Let others covet gold seals and purple sashes—
I rejoice in the freedom of plain cloth and cap.
May my lifespan endure with Heaven and Earth,
my heart at ease, companion to clouds and waters.
I marvel at the Primordial Ancestor of the Grand Supreme—
why do men on earth age so soon?

**7.**
Over a decade in Luoyang,
I never deigned to chase wealth or rank.
I nurtured my being, preventing the primordial qi from scattering,
cultivating so the Valley Spirit might abide.
Hunger sated by the nectar beneath my tongue,
cold dispelled by the fire in my cinnabar field.
I find joy in my nature, content in solitude—
no fleeting beauty can sway my grace.

**8.**
Failing to awaken in this life, they pin hopes on the next—
yet who knows where the next life may lead?
Better to tread the celestial path now—
why descend again into the earth’s pit?
A robust yang soul does not ensure longevity;
a strong yin spirit must bring demise.
All herbs wither after frost—
only the pine remains verdant, evergreen.

**9.**
Once I followed Confucian and Mohist paths, seeking office,
until I suddenly grasped the profound subtlety of the Dao—no hardship there.
When yin qi dissipates, one does not die;
when yang essence abides, one is naturally at peace.
Within this body, I refine boundless medicine;
in the crucible, I burn the elixir of life.
Alas for those enslaved to wealth and lust—
their days consumed in endless torment.

**10.**
Of all things in the world, none merit discourse—
only the body and qi endure.
In the golden crucible, I concoct the life-extending elixir;
in the cinnabar field, I plant the root of agelessness.
Ever do I receive the Great Dao’s subtle guidance—
how could I accept the haphazard favors of common men?
Freed from glory and decay, unstained by defilement,
I fear only the sun’s emergence from the cosmos.

**11.**
The lesser hermit dwells in Kun, the greater in Zou—
I prefer to stand amidst the clamor, at ease.
My heart is as limpid as the moon at heaven’s edge,
my will as steadfast as mountains upon the sea.
I keep desire’s hues from my eyes,
and naturally, my face retains its youth.
Once the *Niwan* cavity is mastered,
why labor over the Great Return?

**12.**
I speak of the profound subtleties of the Primordial,
yet who has truly inquired into their own heart?
When qi flows freely through the Three Fields,
the Two Cavities’ currents are swallowed without cease.
For years I sailed seas in search of life’s medicine,
traversed forests seeking immortality—
how much better to seek within this body,
where the Dao of *Xiyi* is easily found.

**13.**
Secluded in an ancient abbey, better than mountain dwelling,
gates barred by moss, hoofprints rare.
In stillness, I swallow a thousand mouthfuls of nectar;
by the secluded window, I set aside a forest of books.
Fewer disputes, fewer acquaintances;
no greed, no glory, no shame.
Stolidly, I pass the days as they come—
let others call me a fool.

**14.**
Refining primordial essence to restore purity,
all endeavors return to the True.
If fools could all attain the Dao,
how could immortals be called extraordinary?
Repayment comes only when merit is complete;
the state of *Xiyi* is not apart from this body.
Simply circulate the harmonious qi with diligence,
and your countenance will grow ever more youthful.

**15.**
In youth, I endured hardship near the literati,
sixty-odd years slipping by like grass in the wind.
Fortunate to meet a perfected one who taught the Dao,
I entrusted my nature and life to emptiness.
Hair, once white, turned black through qi’s refinement;
a face, once wrinkled, smoothed by essence’s preservation.
The great aim was to stand beside ministers—
yet in my allotted span, I found no end to toil.

**16.**
The flowing current ascends straight to the *Niwan*;
once the joints are unblocked, the countenance is preserved.

**17.**
Enlightenment is like turning a palm to behold,
while delusion lies beyond layered mountains.
Before the spirit’s discernment is clear, a thousand distractions arise;
once the heart’s field is awakened, ten thousand affairs grow still.
If you seek long life and transcendence alike,
all lies in the leisure of this very body.
Why study the Dao only to cling to confusion?
The principle of non-action must still be practiced.

Qi that swallows root and ancestor is not mere exhalation;
hunger that starves the heart’s bowels spares no hunger.
Preserve the primordial essence, and age will not come;
cast off passions and desires, and you return to infancy.
If you further comprehend the *Chongtian* cavity,
you will surely have a carefree, transcendent destiny.

**18.**
Those who seek immortality all learn to refine the Yin elixir,
yet where do they exchange essence, only to lose and regain it?
Before a year has passed, many lie stricken with illness,
just as youth and vigor alter the countenance.
The Yang soul gradually wanes, and no awakening comes;
life and nature are treated as if they were nothing.
If you wish to prolong your years and remain in the world,
preserve essence, guard qi, and inquire in stillness.

**19.**
The purple-robed master, greedy for titles,
neglected the cultivation of qi and the firing of the elixir.
Before middle age, his body was already old,
just as strength and vigor gave way to autumn’s first frost.
Though he knew the path to long life,
he dully followed the flowing stream.
What use was it to hang up his cap and robes?
The pursuit of fame and profit should long since have ceased.

**20.**
Dwelling in the mortal dust for decades,
though he observed forms as supple as a willow,
he constantly refined the primordial qi to nourish his appearance,
and often spoke of cinnabar while seeking the Dao’s current.
One kind of profit and fame held no allure;
all manner of glory and disgrace faded before his eyes.
With money, he bought only cups of wine;
without care or worry, what sorrow remained?

**21.**
For ten years by the firefly’s lamp, he sought renown,
twice sitting for the spring examinations, yet nothing came of it.
With ambition but no opportunity to secure even a minor post,
he turned at last to the study of long life.
How could seeking office compare to seeking immortality?
How could lust for beauty rival love for the Dao?
As long as the countenance remains radiant,
ascension is surely near at hand.

**22.**
What is fame but a fleeting echo across the earth?
How can it compare to secluded cultivation and transcendence?
Diligently firing the elixir through nine cycles,
earnestly circulating qi to reach the Three Clarities—
when the medicine is complete, a path of flight will open;
when merit is full, you must depart for the realm beyond things.
Why crave glory, wealth, and honor?
The body’s firmness is the true essence.

**23.**
People covet beauty and chase riches,
and thus lose their lives and bodies.
Ants and flies bite the flesh, and they fear pain;
the Yang soul departs the body, yet they doubt not.
One day, struck by illness with no cure,
they seek gods in ten thousand ways to avert disaster.
But if you master the refinement of essence and preservation of qi,
how could long life ever be buried in the Yellow Springs?

**24.**
Do not envy the fleeting splendor of the Three Maos;
though you pore over the *Zhouyi*, you copy it in vain.
Only when you awaken to the Dao’s truth and embrace its principle
do you distance yourself from worldly affairs and sever all ties.
Yang essence, endlessly refined, knows no limit;
jade nectar, constantly consumed, is never set aside.
Wait only for the day when merit is complete,
and you will ascend with the mysterious crane, leaving the mortal nest.

**25.**
All seek transmutation to enrich their households,
forgetting that the body withers and the years change.
Chasing beauty, they make themselves slaves to desire;
greedy for wealth, they treat life as lightly as dust.
Though their mouths speak of cultivating the immortal Dao,
their hearts are like yakshas in the night.
Such fools will never awaken—
let the enlightened not grieve for them.

**26.**
Bowing, burning incense, and commissioning painted images—
how can these compare to striving in self-cultivation?
Diligently swallow saliva a thousand times over,
and long remember to guard the spirit through the fifth watch.
Do not neglect the constant rules of guiding and pulling;
be ever mindful to refine the primordial essence.
Though you may not yet ascend to heaven,
your name will surely be recorded in the immortals’ register.

**27.**
Do not read the Nine Classics and Three Histories—
what use are they to you in the end?
How much better to preserve the harmonious qi of breath
and personally tend the great furnace of medicine!
Preserve the Yang essence, and you will sustain old age;
refine the golden substance, and you will ascend in emptiness.
The path to long life is clearly laid out,
yet how can the foolish nature of mortals be turned?

**28.**
The pursuit of rank and wealth knows no end;
what use is it to attain the highest office and greatest riches?
How much better to quiet the heart and forget scheming,
to still the body and dispel all doubt!
Let the song pillow drift with the endless spring days,
and refine essence so the temples never gray.
One day, beyond the world, when we meet again,
it will be as immortals, with a destiny apart.

**29.**
True lead and true mercury are not hard to find—
it is mortals who err in their use of the heart.
The moon’s spirit and the sun’s soul are easily understood,
but the principles of wood essence and fire timing run deep.
Through bitter toil, refine the medicine for three years;
through transformation and spiritual communion, transmute the five metals.
To transcend the world, you need only consume a single grain—
then Penglai and Yingzhou will know your name.

**30.**
The twin gates along the spine lead to the crown’s gate—
this is the root path of cultivation.
Frequently swallow the jade liquid of the Flower Pool,
and the Primordial Lord of the Purple Palace will send it upward.
Constantly let qi pierce through the joints,
and naturally essence will fill and the Valley Spirit abide.
One day, when you reach the land of long life,
you must remember those who first guided you.

*Langranzi* was formerly the abbot of Tongxuan Temple in the Tang dynasty.
His deeds were wondrous, his cultivation profound.
He concealed himself in the world for a hundred years, and in the *Duangong* era of the Song dynasty,
he ascended to heaven in broad daylight at Peach Blossom Lane.
The emperor bestowed the name *Jizhen Temple*,
and his *Thirty Poems on the Immortal’s Awakening to the Dao* circulated in the world.
