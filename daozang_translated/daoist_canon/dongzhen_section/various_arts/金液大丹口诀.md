**Preface to the Oral Precepts of the Great Daoist Elixir of Gold**
Transmitted by the White-Garbed Daoist of Taowei Cavern (太微洞天白衣道者) to Zheng De’an, the Master of Serene and Mysterious Stillness (冲虚妙静宁真子).

To seek **Daoist** transcendence (修真), one must exhaustively explore **principle** (理) and **nature** (性), extending even to the **fate** (命)—thus it may be achieved.
When **nature** (性) is yet unclear, **fate** (命) cannot be known.
Hence, the **Buddhist** school (釋氏) regards **nature** as the primary essence (主), while **fate** is its attendant (伴);
The **Supreme One** (太上) holds **fate** as the primary essence (主), with **nature** as its attendant (伴).
These two doctrines are most profound:
For those who take **nature** as the primary essence (主), they must first clarify the state before one’s parents gave birth to oneself—what was it then?
Having pierced through all phenomena and all illusions (萬境萬緑悉－皆看破),
one realizes that only this **point of pristine, empty, and luminous essence** (此個一點虚靈) is the primary essence (主),
and that this very body is also **empty and illusory** (虚幻).
If such is the case, then in the final stage (末後一着),
how does one **settle and return** (作么收拾回去)?
The **Buddha** (佛) says:
*"The ultimate step (向上一着) is something the thousand sages (千聖) do not impart."*

The adept who attains this is called the **Six Transcendental Liberties** (六通無礙六自在如來). Without this step, one remains a stubborn void (顽空).

The Ancestral Master says:
*"Though you may penetrate the true nature (真如性),
you still risk abandoning the body only to re-enter it.
From now on, you must further refine the Great Elixir (大藥),
suddenly transcending imperfection (無漏) to become a True Person (真人)."*

For those who follow the **Supreme One’s** teaching of **fate** as the primary essence (主),
one must first practice **hollow-stomach cultivation** (實腹養身),
preserve essence to generate **blackness** (保精生黑),
transform **blackness** into **spirit** (以黑化神),
and merge **spirit** with the **Dao** (以神合道).
Even then, one may still achieve **freedom in movement** (纵横猶得),
grow as a **jade tree** (長以玉樹),
with branches, stems, flowers, and leaves flourishing in abundance (枝茎花葉，茂盛之喻).
Through alchemical refinement (工夫鍛煉),
one’s essence becomes **pure yang** (純陽為體),
a body within the body (身外有身),
with myriad transformations (千千變化)—
piercing metal, traversing stone (穿金透石),
manifesting all manner of **spiritual powers** (現種種之神通).
What difference is there from the Buddha?

The two terms, **nature** and **fate**, cannot be split as two,
nor can they be conflated as one.
Thus, the **Immortal’s** alchemical elixir (金液大丹) is a wondrous secret (妙訣),
the **Golden Chest and Jade Bamboo** (金箱玉笋) passed down through ten thousand kalpas (萬劫一傳).

The *Mystic Canon* (《玄科》） states:
*"If one reveals this to the unworthy, the Heavenly Dao is sealed.
If one carelessly transmits to the unfit, Heaven’s treasure is spilled.
To leak it lightly is to invite slow death—
the Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors will judge in the underworld (冥考)."*

Master **Bo Yang** (伯陽祖師) said:
*"I dare not lightly speak of this with those who possess the kidney essence (窃與腎者談),
lest I write of it on bamboo or silk (寫情記竹帛),
for fear of revealing Heaven’s decree (泄天符).
If I were to speak recklessly, my tongue would fester,
the Dao would be sealed, and I would face execution (閉道獲罪誅).
Though it may be transmitted orally (可以口訣),
it cannot be written down (難以書傳).*
Reflect deeply—no need for further debate.
Guard it in silence, do not transmit it in writing (深藏守，莫傳文)."

Master **Ping Shu** (平叔祖師) said:
*"In my past, I transmitted this three times to others,
and three times met with calamity.
From now on, I shall seal my lips and close my tongue.
Even if the cauldron is before me and the blade at my neck,
I shall dare not speak again!"*

I ponder this: if all under Heaven were to grasp this Dao,
how should such strict observance be upheld?
Though one has received transmission from a teacher,
leaks are inevitable—
even if one’s bones are ground to powder and body shattered,
it is difficult to repay the teacher’s virtue (師德).
The Master said:
*"One who transmits the Dao benefits nine generations of ancestors.
The **Supreme One’s** enduring wish for longevity
shall not be cut off by force."*

Thus, I composed the **Sixty-Four-Character Oral Precepts** (六十四句口訣),
titled *The Supreme One’s Direct Pointer to the True Fire Symbol in Seven-Character Verse* (《太一含真火符直指七言詩》) seventeen stanzas,
and *The One-Catty Gold* (《一秤金》), *The Western River Moon* (《西江月》) six stanzas,
aligned with the **Pure Heaven** (純乾) hexagram.
Within, all essential techniques are encompassed:
the **alchemical openings** (下手工夫玄),
the **single orifice** (關一竅),
the **sources of medicines and minerals** (藥物川源),
the **fire alchemy** (火候),
the **secret principles** (秘旨),
the **refinement and withdrawal** (進退抽添),
the **ritual bathing, nourishment, and spirit transformation** (沐浴溫養脫胎神化)—
all are thoroughly detailed.

This is what I have personally attained through practice.
I hope scholars will diligently refine their efforts,
seeing daily results.
After verification, one must:
- **Measure the daily progress** (消息拟時),
- **Distinguish clarity and turbidity** (要準辨),
- **Recognize stagnation and vitality** (認浮沉),
- **Discern obscurity and luminosity** (識昏明),
- **Know the early and late stages** (知早晚),
- **Avoid drowsiness** (莫瞌睡),
- **Regulate diet and drink** (節飲食).
When the alchemical work is complete,
**descend to receive** (降則取),
**ascend to welcome** (升則迎),
**forge into a radiant mass** (打成團),
and **emit luminous clarity** (發光明).

「The **Dao** is subtle and continuous—yet free from great excess;
**Qi** rages wildly—then fear of deficiency arises.

Acquiring it is no easy task, practicing it is no easy task,
but preserving it is the most difficult of all.

With the labor of ten months’ toil,
one may forever enjoy boundless ease.

Yet few know who is truly decisive and bold,
who reaches profound compassion,
or who understands the **Dao** and attains it.

Those who practice it silently,
with every word in harmony,
shall fulfill their wish for **virtue** and tranquility.

If one encounters a master’s precepts,
whether sincere or not,
whether practiced or neglected,
whether diligent or slack—
then it is not the fault of **virtue** and tranquility.

I swear by the **Dao**:
If I, a future sage, fail to teach others,
I shall bear the **Dao’s** judgment through countless kalpas.

Should any who read this text
grow careless or negligent,
they will forever become lower ghosts,
and their misfortune shall extend to the Nine **Abysses**.
Let scholars take heed!

**The Golden Elixir’s Oral Precepts**

The precepts say:
At age nineteen, I sought my master,
and met the **Most Authentic** Old White-Browed Sage.
In one word, he pointed out the **Mysterious Pass** (玄关窍),
yet few grasp its essence or absence.

Upon returning with the **Pass**,
I focused solely on **inner vision**,
for the Yellow Nurse lies within these very realms.
Now I dare not shirk the **Dao’s** retribution—
I reveal this to those who seek immortality.

Beneath the heart, above the kidneys, in the high center,
where the **Hairy Buddha** (髻佛) serves as foundation,
do not cling to mere forms and fabricate actions—
instead, **concentrate** and **settle** the spirit’s essence.

When practicing, sit cross-legged in **great stillness**,
forgetting all worldly dust, fixing the gaze downward.
Let the breath flow softly and **refine** itself—
if it does not settle, even by a hair’s breadth.

Once this stage is reached, all thoughts must cease,
for if the mind still stirs, **qi** and spirit will depart.
Endure as if your body were falling into a thousand pieces,
accept life or death without hesitation or doubt.

Suddenly, the hundred vessels gather **qi**,
and the heart grows dim as strength wanes.
The **Golden Elixir** fills the mouth in gentle waves—
then a cool breeze stirs at the crown of the head.

Within the center, a single **Dao**-channel of heat surges,
until it reaches the **Tail Vein** (尾闻), where it transforms into **Yin**.
Fierce and ascending, it pierces the **Kunlun Peak**,
and coalesces into a single **jewel-like pearl** suspended there.

It descends steadily, clear as snow pear—
then drips into the **Jade Pool**,
where the **Elixir** is gently guided to its proper course.

Passing through layered chambers into the **Earthen Furnace** (土釜),
the **Red Lotus** contains its essence, a marvelous sight.
With **intent**, send it into the **Golden Cauldron** (黄金鼎),
where the fire ignites without human aid.

This is the **Dao’s** natural true fire—
when it arises, its timing is known to few.
An instant’s **elixir** yields an instant’s harvest,
a moment’s fire brings a moment’s revelation.

Thousands of scriptures and treatises record it not—
now I disclose it, yet wish you to keep it secret.

Each day, the **One Yang** (一阳) rises and subsides,
so **advance the fire** without delay.
No other method need be considered—
only guide the heart’s **intent** to welcome it.

If the fire is **forceful**, let the heart be **forceful**;
if the fire is **gentle**, let the **intent** follow suit.

Gradually, **Mercury** dries as **Lead** is exhausted,
**refinement and withdrawal** mirror the waxing and waning phases.
**Ritual bathing** must avoid the **Mao** and **You** months,
for adding fire then would risk collapse.

Once this stage is reached, **regulate** the **qi** to preserve and guard,
and beyond it, act with caution.

In ten months, **conception and nourishment** take form,
and on that day, a **sage’s** appearance reveals itself.

Their countenance is identical—no two are alike—
only then does the **Dao’s** wondrous **virtue** fully manifest.

One final word I entrust to you:
Do not abandon **spirit transformation** (脱胎) in reckless haste.
If the **spirit** departs too soon, it cannot wander freely.
Wait until the **Three Thousand Practices** (三千功) are complete,
then enter the **Jade Emperor’s** **Celestial Court** (玉皇下韶) and ascend to the **Elixir Platform** (丹墀).

**Seventeen Verses on Initial Practice**

**First Sitting:**
Sit cross-legged in **great stillness** for half a year,
then cultivate **purity and tranquility**, severing all dusty ties.
Afterward, apply my **True and Wondrous Precepts**,
with sincere devotion and single-minded focus on the **Central Field** (中田).

**Initial Practice:**
**Concentrate** the spirit and **settle** the will within the **Yellow Palace** (黄宫),
as the hundred **vessels** (百豚) ascend to the **Celestial Source** (朝元).
Heavy as a mountain, pure as rain,
the fire surges forth in an instant.

**When the Practice is Complete:**
From **Great Ultimate** (太极), formless **qi** is born,
and silently, **one qi** transforms into **Yin and Yang**.
Within the clear, **Yin** descends from Heaven,
while **Yin**-enfolded **Yin** reveals the **Red** from Earth.

**Fire’s Timing:**
The **Sages** pass down medicines but not fire,
for few have ever known its proper measure.
Now I reveal Heaven’s **Dao**-secret:
the fire’s first stir begins at **Child Hour** (子时).

**Measuring Time and Clarity:**
Within the furnace, a **flame** blazes red—
also welcome it with the heart into the **Earthen Palace** (土宫).
Each day, the **One Yang** must be **regulated**—
do not err, lest your **Dao**-labor be wasted.

**Medicine and Its Manifestations:**
Before the **One** (守一), the furnace’s **seed** sprouts,
as **Cinnabar** (朱砂) in the **Golden Cauldron** glows bright.
Within the **Central Palace**, the **Jade Elixir** drips steadily,
while the **Luminous Moon** hangs in the sky, purifying the **qi**.

**Ascension and Descension, Binding and Uniting:**
**Water** issues from the **High Source**, descending to **Jade Capital** (玉京),
while **Fire** arises from the **Earthly Gate**, emitting **Luminous Clarity**.
With each ascension and descension, it returns to the **Central Earth** (中土),
and when bound, it forms a **clustered** **Yin** within the **Abyss** (坎).

**Refinement and Withdrawal’s Marvelous Use:**
**Mercury** returns to the **Golden Cauldron** as **Lead** lies hidden,
while **Lead** emerges from the **Jade Furnace** as **Mercury** dissipates.
The **two substances**’ presence or absence yield the **Ultimate Treasure**,
for their **refinement and withdrawal**’s **Dao**-law naturally transcends.

**Stagnation and Vitality, Ritual Bathing:**
The cause of **ritual bathing** lies in two subtle **intents**,
and practitioners must not contravene its timing.
Let the **True Qi** permeate and **nourish** the body’s every part,
then **one qi**’s **stagnation and vitality** shall harmonize.

**The Purple River Cart:**
**Nourishing** the **Original Spirit** with **qi** and **essence**,
the **Purple River Cart** moves like a windmill.
The **plashing** of water echoes within the **Flowering Pool** (华池),
while **radiant** gold light suffuses the body, bringing **Spring Vitality** (体春).

**Gathering and Scattering, Transformation:**
The **shortening** arises when the **two substances** unite,
while **lengthening** disperses as the **form** returns.
When **Yang** exhausts, **Mercury** dries up—all ceases.
Wait until the **Full Cycle** (周天) reignites its **Dao**-mechanism.

**Nurturing the Qi-Mother:**
The **Golden Womb** (金胎) and **Spirit Chamber** (神室) reside in the **Central Palace** (中官),
whether present or absent, **practice** must accumulate.
In three months, its form resembles an **orange**,
and in a year, its **refinement** reaches the **Heavenly Red** (亘天红).

**A Hundred Days’ Foundation:**
Within ten **decades** (旬), **refine** with caution and **fullness**,
gradually sensing the **fragrance of chrysanthemum** (菊馨) at the furnace’s edge.
Now it is half-formed—**progress** is evident—
so tread lightly and await its emergence into the **Yellow Court** (黄庭).

**Days to Avoid for Ritual Bathing:**
In the **Mao** and **You** months, **open** your **womb**,
and **preserve** the **Sacred Embryo** without stirring the fire.
When ten months’ **refinement** is complete, **Luminous Clarity** pierces the body,
and the **Heavenly Gate** blazes open, splitting the **nape** (项).

**Transferring Spirit and Exchanging the Nape.**»

**The Daoist Alchemical Ascension**

The **Waxing Moon** shifts the spirit straight upward—
once the **Three Passes** are pierced, **Spiritual Clarity** flows.
The **Celestial Maiden** gazes upward at **Kunlun’s Peak**,
piercing the **Yellow Court** to enter the **Purple Palace**.

**Nurturing the Embryonic Immortal**
When **qi** is full, the **Divine Embryo** enters the **Purple Palace**,
and for three years, it must be **warmly nourished** with **composure**.
If even a thread of **mundane desire** intervenes,
the **Path to Penglai** vanishes in ten thousand layers.

**Natural Transfiguration**
After nine years, the **Outer Body** is **lifted**—
now **entering and exiting** is no longer under one’s control.
When the **Decree is fulfilled**, the **Celestial Summons** arrives,
and the **Crane-Carriage** glides gracefully to the **Purple Court**.

**Six *West River Moon* Poems**

The **One Yang** is fully peeled—**Returning Rebirth** begins,
**Warmly** nurturing the **Soul-Spring** from the **Well’s Depth**.
**White Snow** descends in endless flurries across the **Heavenly Expanse**,
while the **Immortal** feasts in the **Jade Pavilion**.

Suddenly, the **Yellow Court’s Herald** reports—
the **Emerald Maiden** has arrived at the **Palace Gate**.
The two meet and **seal their bond with green vows**,
knowing no mortal may witness this union.

When the **Two Yangs** arrive, the **Summons** must be hastened—
the **Golden Sage** is urgently invoked.
The three reunite in the **Yellow Palace**,
sharing **Grace and Virtue** in joyous harmony.
They drink **Dragon’s Blood** and **Tiger’s Marrow**,
savoring **fragrant wine** from the **Celestial Vessel**.
Such **wealth and honor** belong to the **Daoist Sage**,
far surpassing the pleasures of mortal opulence.

Suddenly, the **Three Yangs** harmonize—
**Misty vapors** fill the cosmos, spring reborn.
The **Land prospers**, the **Nation thrives**—**New Year’s blessings** abound,
and all beneath the **Heavenly Vault** rejoice.
Unbeknownst, the **Lantern Festival** arrives,
as the **Imperial Court** illuminates the **Flowering Lanterns**.
Children and elders alike **secretly exult**,
remembering the **Moon’s Fullness**—
when **Heaven’s Thunder** roared, **Great Boldness** descended,
and all **feared** to **cultivate the self**.
**Mountains shrouded in qi-vapors** steamed,
as **Bathing in the Void** brought **Purity and Stillness**.
Only the **Wise** perceive this truth—
then they must **grasp the Essentials of the True Ones**.

When **Yin and Yang** reach this **equilibrium**,
the **Eight Trigrams’ Virtue and Penalty** align.
The **Old Yang** expels the **Young Maiden**,
and the **entire clan** becomes **male**.
When the **Five Phases** and **Four Symbols** flourish,
**Wealth and Honor** arise from this **auspice**.
The **Central Palace** is **gilded with gold**,
its **stairs** paved with **layers of jade**.
Moreover, within the **body** lies the **Diamond**—
comparable to **Yuanshi’s Suspended Pearl**.
In **Pure Summer’s Fourth Month**, the **Flowering Pool’s** old blossoms bloom anew,
as **Golden Waves** reflect the **Lunar Tower**,
and **Pearl Dew** drips from the **Lotus**, worthy of love.
**Heaven’s Natural Transformation** must be **guided by Divine Movement**—
**Void-Cultivation’s Practice** is the **strange marvel**,
unfathomable to the common mind.

**Song of Ease**

Do you not see?
In the **Easeful Nest**, the **idle man** seeks neither wealth nor fame,
but **finds the Existent** within the **None**—
only when he **discerns True from False** does he **awaken**.

The **Dao** is originally **dim and vague**,
yet **Yin and Yang** restraining each other **give rise to things**.
The **scholar**, **foolish and confused**, knows not—
through **ten thousand histories** and **a thousand scriptures**, he **finds no answer**.

When the **Clear Teacher** appears,
and **directly points to the secret**—
it lies in the **eyebrows and eyelashes**.
To reach the **High Peak** in an instant,
without it, one **wanders in vain**.

**Establish the Furnace**, **root the Foundation**—
**Mercury** hides in **Receptive**, **Lead** in **Creative**.
The two **unite** in the **Earthen Tripod**,
with **Yellow Mother** as the **matchmaker**, **perfectly paired**.

This **substance** is **nowhere to be found**—
only the **Mysterious and Subtle** may recognize it.
**One’s own labor** is **one’s own harvest**,
no **tyrant’s force** can **plunder it**.

All have **qi, essence, and spirit**—
not **cinnabar** nor **mercury**.
In the **Crescent Furnace**, **fire is constantly fed**,
until the **Golden Essence** is **refined to a single jin**.

With the **Root secured**, why **fear the branches**?
**Effortless and unbounded**, **naturally at ease**,
**Adverse and favorable**—the **body itself** aligns.
When **Symbols are grasped**, **words are forgotten**, and **True Awakening** dawns.

Men laugh at my **poverty**, yet I am not poor—
how can the **body** be poor when the **Dao** is not?
The **Mysterious Pearl**, my **precious friend**,
nurtured in the **Dan Field**, is **beyond price**.

**Empty yet not empty**, **form yet not form**—
**Transformation’s Cycle** knows **no end**.
If asked how this is done,
I cannot **share it** with you.

**Wasting the Spirit**, **exhausting effort**—
the **fate of the shallow** is **unfathomable**.
They **know not** **South from North**, nor **East from West**,
nor can they **distinguish** **Green from Yellow**, **Qi from White**.

**Washing in the Sweet Spring**, **cleansing filth**—
even **Immortal Adepts** were once **common folk**.
The **Marvelous Use** is **clear before one’s eyes**,
yet the **path is rugged**, the **journey far**.

**Guest becomes Host**, **Host becomes Guest**—
**Guest and Host** regard each other, **ever closer**.
**Discussing the Dao-Canon** relies on **oral precepts**,
and within lies the **natural truth**.

**Preserve the Mind**, **nurture the Nature**—
when **Nature is preserved**, the **Mind is naturally correct**.
**Non-action in action**, **nothing left undone**—
all **phenomena forgotten**, the **Spirit responds**.

**True or False**, **False or True**—
**True-False-False-True** twists into **delusion**.
The **unawakened** fail to **grasp the Primordial Principle**,
while the **Enlightened** ascend to **Taiwei’s Heights**.

When the **fish is caught**, why **keep the net**?
When the **river is crossed**, why **retain the raft**?
The **Song of Ease in the Easeful Nest**—
this is the **Secret of Eternal Life**.

**The *Return-to-Truth* Essay for Later Learners**

The **Dao is the Mind**, the **Mind is the Dao**—
the **Dao arises from the Mind**, the **Mind has the Dao**.
Through **Mind**, the **Dao is illuminated**; through the **Dao**, the **Mind is awakened**.
The **Mind gives rise to Nature**, the **Nature follows the Mind**.

This **Nature** is the **True Nature**—
**neither born nor extinguished**, **neither coming nor going**,
**neither increasing nor decreasing**,
**thus and such**, **naturally luminous and penetrating**,
**round and free**, the **Great Void** itself.

**Transformation and Response** are called **Spirit**—
its **origin** is such that **Spirit without Mind cannot stand**,
**Mind without qi cannot form**,
**qi without essence cannot manifest**, **essence without qi cannot generate**;
**qi without Spirit cannot move**, **Spirit without qi cannot act**;
**qi without essence cannot settle**, **essence without Spirit cannot congeal**;
**Spirit without Mind cannot be guarded**, **Mind without Spirit cannot be alert**.

The **Spirit’s alertness**—
**swift yet not hasty**, **arrives yet not sought**,
**transformation beyond measure**, **naturally so**,
yet **unknowable in its so-ness**.

I know the **wondrous functions of Mind and Spirit**!
Thus, **Bodhidharma** came from the West,
**not establishing scriptures**,
**facing the wall for nine years**,
**directly pointing to the Mind**—
**seeing Nature and becoming Buddha** is this.

This **Mind** is not the **thinking, scheming, imagined heart**,
but the **Heavenly Heart**, the **Heart within Man**.

In the human body to seek it,
one must not seek it elsewhere.

Encountering the Sage of the highest order,
one cannot hear nor see it unless divinely granted.
Though one may encounter such a Sage,
and he teaches in secret,
if one does not cultivate the **self-downward** stillness and refinement of **gongfu**,
even in the **Great Death Field** recognizing it clearly,
one still may not know it.

Once known, truly known,
once awakened—
one from this **has** the Dao,
two from this **obtains** the Way,
three from this **generates** the ten thousand things,
and **creates** boundless transformation!

Thus, Buddhas, immortals, and sages,
profoundly understanding the **Great Dao**,
penetrating the **Heavenly Heart**,
mastering the **yin-yang** transformations,
and perceiving the **wondrous principles** and **mystic mechanisms**,
all derive from this **Mind**.

The **Mind** of the sage,
the **Mind** of the common man—
in truth, it is but **one Mind**.
Those who awaken become sages,
those who remain lost are common.

Alas!
The **Dao is near yet sought afar**,
the matter is easy yet pursued with difficulty—
why so?

The **True Suchness** of wondrous Nature,
each individual **perfectly complete**,
yet through **greed** and **attachment**,
they are nowhere to be found.

A **true man** must be resolute and bold,
directly assuming responsibility—
to grasp these words,
to apply oneself thus,
and **align with the Dao**—this is authenticity!

**Poetic Insight** to the **Mystic Gateway**:
Plucking the **hundred veins** of meaning,
**True Lead** at the ocean’s depths releases **golden light**,
**Spirit returns** to the **Chaos of Primordium**,
**Mystic Elixir** atop the mountain becomes **jade nectar**.
The **Great Elixir** of **Golden Liquid**—
the **oral formula** of the **Great Alchemy** is complete.
