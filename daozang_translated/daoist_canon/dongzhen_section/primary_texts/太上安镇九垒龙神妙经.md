**The Supreme Scripture for Pacifying and Securing the Nine-Tiered Dragon Spirits**

Once, the Supreme Venerable Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning dwelled in the Cavernous Yang Heaven, summoning the sacred assemblies of the ten directions to gather and expound the wondrous Dharma.

At that time, the Perfected One with Upright Tablet addressed the Celestial Worthy, saying: "I observe that the sentient beings of Jambudvīpa, after constructing their dwellings, frequently encounter calamities. What expedient means may be employed to deliver the foolish and ignorant?"

The Celestial Worthy replied: "Excellent! You should listen carefully."

Thereupon, the Celestial Worthy intoned with a voice vast and empty:

The Original Beginning bound the *qi*,
Within the primordial chaos.
Below, forms took shape,
Coiling through the dark void.
The earth’s net extends to its roots,
Within dwell numinous perfected ones.
Known as the Lord of the Earthly Sovereign,
He receives his investiture from the Imperial Throne.
His palaces number thirty-six,
Governing and sustaining the myriad spirits.
Metal and stone intertwine, firm and unyielding,
Their mechanisms converging at Kunlun.
Embracing the vast and boundless depths,
Wind and marsh ever pervade.
The wondrous principle follows the *Lingbao*,
Profound virtue stands unshaken.
Through kalpas and transformations, cycling the great reckoning,
Dragons and serpents all bear their burdens.
The true Dao accords with nature,
How then could perverse and wicked forces arise?
The Two Modes penetrate to their utmost function,
The mysterious convergence preserves the Yellow Tranquility.

The Celestial Worthy addressed the Perfected One, saying: "If there are good men and good women who, upon constructing dwellings, disturb the dragon spirits—causing the house to creak and groan, the earth to bloom or split, whether in the southern hall or northern chamber, eastern gallery or western door, well or hearth, millstone or grindstone, storehouse or granary, boats or carts, the lodging of the six livestock, pens and enclosures, farmsteads, temples, or any structure, room, gallery, cave, or den—thereby offending the celestial *sha*, earthly *sha*, yearly *sha*, monthly *sha*, daily *sha*, hourly *sha*, the *sha* of the four directions, the earth deities of the five directions, the Azure Dragon and White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior, the Generals and Grand Year-Star, the Yellow Banner and Leopard Tail, the spirits of the twelve hours, the taboos of the six *jia*, the Earth Lord and Earth Mother, the Earthly Mansion and Crouching Dragon, and all malevolent *sha*—they should recite this scripture to expiate and appease the offended spirits. All shall then withdraw, returning to the four directions, each securing its own quarter, daring not to cause harm.

By reciting this scripture, all such evil spirits shall dissipate of themselves, illnesses shall be dispelled, the body shall grow strong, and the form light.

The merit of reciting this scripture is boundless.

If good men and good women, in safeguarding silkworms and mulberries, recite this scripture, blessings and karmic retribution shall follow.

Or if, when constructing houses or excavating earth, they recite this scripture three times—or even a hundred times—it shall cause the earthly mansions to harmonize, yin and yang to unite, the dwelling’s orientation to be auspicious, and the dragon spirits to assist and support. A hundred blessings shall converge, the household shall know peace, all obstacles shall vanish, every desire shall be fulfilled, and every wish shall come to pass."

Thereupon, the Perfected One and the sacred assembly, having heard this scripture, rejoiced greatly. They bowed in reverence and withdrew, respectfully transmitting and practicing it.
