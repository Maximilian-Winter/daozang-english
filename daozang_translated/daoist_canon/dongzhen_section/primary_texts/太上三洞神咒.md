Decreed the divine ruler,
Bestowing it with fine abilities.
Guarding body and life,
Restraining the myriad spirits.
Within it, the Three Terraces,
Above it, the Seven Stars.
Divine talismans on four sides,
Governing the netherworld.
As the heart directs,
Mountains and peaks crumble.
Thirty-six generals,
Guardian soldiers of the ruler.
Soaring through the skies, inspecting lives,
Moving to stir the Three Clarities.
Delivering people, extending life,
Calming disasters and harm.
Slaying evil, eradicating poison,
Ghosts and specters vanish.
Ascending to immortality, entering sagehood,
Transcending with the ruler.
In harmony with sun and moon,
Dao and qi endure eternally.
Pointing at evil to return to rectitude,
Descending the impure, ascending the pure.
The six heavens’ ghostly thieves,
Upon seeing it, perish and collapse.
The Dao has no high or low,
With the ruler, it prospers.
Climbing mountains, beasts submit,
Entering seas, dragons ascend.
Traveling at dawn, dew scatters,
Traveling at night, the body is light.
Surrounding divine generals,
Bing, Ren, Jia, and Geng.
Summoning clouds and rain,
Thunder crashes and roars.
What spirit does not submit?
What ghost does not tremble?
Those who resist the ruler perish,
Those who honor it live.
Those who defy it are disgraced,
Those who revere it are honored.
Those who venerate it live long,
Those who oppose it perish.
The Marshal’s decree,
The Northern Emperor’s covenant.
Operating the workings of creation,
The Seven Governors align.
Those who violate my decree,
Those who resist my covenant,
Shall be cut into ten thousand pieces,
Forever dead without life.
Swift as statute and command!
