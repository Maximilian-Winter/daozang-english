**Chapter One: The Daoist Embracing Unity and Manifesting the Way**

Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp its operations—thus all is complete.
Heaven has five hidden calamities; those who perceive them flourish.
These five calamities dwell within the heart, then manifest in Heaven.
The cosmos lies within the palm; ten thousand transformations arise from the body.
Heaven’s nature is humanity; humanity’s heart is the mechanism.
Establish Heaven’s Dao to stabilize humanity.
When Heaven unleashes its killing intent, stars shift their lodges.
When Earth unleashes its killing intent, dragons and serpents crawl ashore.
When humanity unleashes its killing intent, Heaven and Earth invert.
When Heaven, Earth, and humanity unite in intent, all transformations find their foundation.
Nature has skill and clumsiness; both can be concealed.
The nine orifices’ malevolence lies in the three vital gates—thus motion and stillness are governed.
Fire arises from wood; when calamity strikes, it must conquer.
Deceit arises within the state; when its time comes, it collapses.
To know and refine this is to be a Sage.
Heaven’s birth and death are the Way’s principle.

**Chapter Two: Nourishing the Realm and Securing the People**

Heaven and Earth are thieves of all things;
All things are thieves of humanity;
Humanity is the thief of all things.
When the three thieves are balanced, the Three Powers are at peace.
Thus it is said:
Eat in season, and the hundred limbs harmonize.
Stir the mechanism, and all transformations settle.
Humanity knows its spirit as spirit, yet does not know the *so* of its spirit—this is how it becomes spirit.
The sun and moon have their numbers; great and small have their limits.
From this, Sages arise; from this, divine clarity emerges.
Their thieving mechanism—none beneath Heaven can see, none can know.
The virtuous one attains it and preserves himself; the petty one attains it and risks his life.

**Chapter Three: Martial Strategy and Victory**

The blind excel in hearing; the deaf excel in sight.
Sever the single source of profit, and armies multiply tenfold;
Reverse day and night three times, and armies multiply ten thousandfold.
The heart is born from things, dies from things—its mechanism lies in the eyes.
Heaven, though without favor, gives rise to great benevolence.
Swift lightning and violent winds—none escape their stupor.
Excessive joy leaves residue; excessive stillness leaves austerity.
Heaven’s utmost selfishness becomes its utmost impartiality.
The control of beasts lies in *qi*.
The living are the roots of death;
Death is the root of life.
Benevolence arises from harm; harm arises from benevolence.
The foolish take Heaven and Earth’s patterns as sacred;
I take the patterns of time and things as wise.
Others deem me foolish; I deem myself not foolish as sacred.
Others await my sainthood; I do not await sainthood.
Thus, plunging cold water into fire—self-destruction is inevitable.

The Dao of Nature is still, so Heaven and Earth and all things are born.
The Dao of Heaven and Earth is dormant, so yin and yang prevail.
Yin and yang, in their mutual overcoming, flow in harmonious transformation.
Thus, the Sage knows the Dao of Nature cannot be defied—
therefore, he governs in accordance with it.
The utmost stillness transcends the reach of calendars and measurements.
Hence arise wondrous instruments, giving birth to all phenomena.
The Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems hold divine mechanisms, hidden like ghosts.
The arts of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming are clearly revealed in symbols.
