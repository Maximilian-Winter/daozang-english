**The Supreme Jade Pendant and Golden Diadem Scripture of the Great Ultimate Golden Writ (Upper Volume)**

On the first day of the first month of the first year of the *Shangling* era, as the Six Origins conjoined in celebration and the cyclical sign *jiazi* governed the dawn, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning and the Supreme Thearch ascended together upon azure mists and purple auroras, mounting the Nine Profound’s precipice at the formless summit. They wandered the cavern-heavens, roamed the ultimate origin, their gazes sweeping freely, their forms at ease upon the floating wheel. Beholding the Two Modes as they divided, observing the great transformation enduring forever, they looked down upon the imperial throne and rejoiced in the Dao, delighting therein. Surveying the revolutions of time to alter the cosmic measures, they awakened to the turning of the kalpa’s wheel, entreating auspicious omens from the Great Void, expounding the supreme Dharma in the Nine Heavens. They initiated the sacred covenant, purified the altar, and fasted in the Empyrean Court.

On that day, the celestial light suddenly dimmed, sun and moon darkened at noon, the Eight Qi receded, the Seven Origins concealed their essence, the mysterious constellations stagnated, and the myriad perfected fled in spirit. For three days and nights, the azure fowl heralded the dawn. Then, nine suns blazed brilliantly in the east, their mysterious radiance illuminating the celestial origin. A black crow arrived in flight, bearing a purple writ in its beak, alighting upon the jade portico. Descending through the void, it divinely bestowed the text upon the Celestial Venerable and the Supreme Thearch.

Thereupon, the two lords fasted in the Highest Heaven and reverently recorded the true writ, saying:

*The Jade Pendant and Golden Diadem Scripture of the Great Ultimate Golden Writ, the Treasure Scripture of the Mysterious True Cavern and the Two Radiant Treasures*—its literary splendor rises to the Grand Empyrean, its divine radiance shines throughout the Nine Heavens. Its jade verses illumine wisdom in the Purple Void, its precious tones resound clearly across the rosy ford. The Most High transmitted it to the maidens of pure spirit, the Supreme Perfected bestowed it upon the lads of the purple dawn, each attended by three thousand to guard the sacred writ. Jade maidens scattered blossoms to dispel defilement, purple lads wafted incense to ward off dust. Resplendent lights converged, fragrant smoke ascended in fourfold offering. Auspicious clouds lingered, the Seven Origins infused their essence, the Nine Brilliances shone brightly, celestial perfected arrayed themselves in full. Rivers and seas stilled their waves, the Eight Winds propelled the cosmic wheel. Golden immortals wielded halberds, the Five Thearchs brandished banners. Ten billion winged immortals held pennants and standards, their troops arrayed in myriad coils. Flying dragons and venomous beasts brandished claws upon clouded peaks. Jade trees stirred their flutes, a hundred melodies harmonized. The *gong* and *shang* notes resonated in the void, high and low forming a melody. The Queen of the West struck the rhythm, celestial maidens arrayed their chimes. The Eight Sounds clamored, ethereal echoes filled the celestial encampment. The Twin Sovereigns quickened the tempo, phoenixes danced and simurghs soared. The fourfold *Longhua* dance unfolded, voices united in song. Cloud zithers rang out, startling the Jade Clarity. Flying hymns interwove, the vast music filled the empty court. Mysterious and yellow lights blazed, dense as a net of stars. The Three Treasures intermingled, weaving through the void to encircle the spirit. The myriad perfected rejoiced in harmony, the Three Candles merged their brilliance. Without day or night, eternal celebration filled the celestial expanse.

Thereupon, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning and the Supreme Thearch swore a golden and azure covenant with heaven, invoking the spirits of the Nine Voids, and received the transmission of the Supreme Perfected. They cast gold into tablets and inscribed the sacred writ, directing the Mother of Tortoises to hold the brush and the Great One to sweep the mat. Enclosed in a cloud-brocade pouch, it was concealed within a verdant and luxuriant coffer, sealed with the Three Origins’ seal of Jade Clarity, and entrusted to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital and the Feathered Attendant of the Immortal Court, to be stored in the Jade Terrace of Primordial Simplicity and the Feathered Chamber of Mysterious Clouds.

They further commanded three hundred Jade Maidens of the Dragon Flower of the Northern Frigid Golden Terrace and three hundred Jade Lads of the Western Void Jade Palace of the White Void, each to bear incense and hold towels, attending the sacred perfected. According to the statutes of the Supreme Perfected, the scripture shall be transmitted after ten thousand kalpas to those whose bone constitution accords with immortality. Whoever obtains and beholds it shall inscribe their name in the Great Ultimate’s register and present it to the Upper Clarity. Those who lightly divulge or profane it shall be recorded among the infernal officials, punished with the wind-blade, and their seven generations held accountable. How could one not be cautious?

On the first day of the third month of the first year of the *Zhonghuang* era, at the hour when celestial virtue conjoined, the Celestial Venerable descended his teachings within the Yellow Chamber of the Jasper Terrace of the Frigid Numinous Cinnabar Palace. He commanded the Five Elders of the Immortal Capital to unfurl the frost-embroidered cloud-brocade wrapping and open the verdant and luxuriant coffer, revealing *The Jade Pendant and Golden Diadem Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean and the Treasure Scripture of the Mysterious True Cavern and the Two Radiant Treasures*. He transmitted it to the Highest Sage, the Jade Dawn Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens; the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise; the Three Origins Lord of the Purple Clarity and Primordial Simplicity; and the Yellow Venerable of the Center.

The Supreme Thearch transmitted it to the Heavenly Thearch, the Thearch of the Grand Tenuity, the Supreme Prohibition Lord of the Upper Origin of the Southern Culmen, and the Heavenly Thearch of the Golden Watchtower of the Upper Clarity.

At that time, the assembled perfected ascended the Jasper Terrace of the Cavern-Realms in the celestial palace, entering the Jade Chamber within the Golden Flower. They fasted for three months, arraying gold and azure to swear their covenant with the spirits, pledging their cinnabar oath to the Supreme Perfected.

Thereupon, the Lord of the Jade Pendant and the Essence of the Hun, clad in a pearl-embroidered, flowered mantle and a flying brocade azure skirt, a crown of moon and sun adorning his head, held the jade pendant and stood to the left. The Lord of the Golden Diadem and the Spirit of the Po, clad in a purple-embroidered, pearled mantle and a flying gauze crimson skirt, a floral crown of moon and sun adorning his head, held the golden diadem and stood to the right. The two lords, facing the numinous mandate, swore their covenant. Then, azure and white lights blazed brilliantly in the Nine Heavens, their radiance streaming through the Great Void, startling the Four Offices and Five Thearchs of Jade Clarity, the countless hosts of winged immortals. In an instant, they arrived, led by the Jade Lads of the Immortals bearing the Five Thearchs’ numinous inkstones. The assembled immortals took their floating positions, the myriad spirits guarded the portico. The Celestial Lord of Primordial Beginning wore the crown of the Boundless Cavern-Heaven, a mantle of nine-colored *li* silk, a robe of flying frost and pearls, a sash bearing the divine radiance of the sun and the ringing jade of *yuyan*. At his left hip hung the *huoluo*, at his right, the Golden Perfected.

The Grand Thearch wore a crown of seven pearls, draped in a mantle of nine-hued natural cloud-patterned silk, a robe of flying *luo* cloth aglow with radiant feathers. His waistband bore phoenix insignia with flowing gold and fire-bells, and in his hand he held the nine-colored staff of life and demon-subduing. The Nine Elder Immortals of the Celestial Capital raised golden essence tables suspended in the void, upon which rested the sacred writ, to be conferred upon the assembled perfected. Thereupon, the affairs of the numinous covenant were declared complete. Each was attended by three hundred golden immortal youths and maidens of Mount Taihua, who guarded the divine perfected.

Such exalted sages all receive the numinous writ thrice monthly. When the cosmic qi of heaven and earth intermingled at the end of the Three Dynasties, it was transmitted to the seed-people. Those with mystic names inscribed in the Jade Register were listed among the people of the Three Primordial Heavens. Since none of this lineage remains, it is kept secret in the Golden Chamber, and the true writ must not be rashly proclaimed nor the numinous text lightly divulged.

*The Jade Pendant: The Cavern-Flying Treasure Scripture of the Great Empyrean*

The Jade Pendant is wrought from the essence of the nine celestial souls. Above the Nine Heavens, it is called the Morning Lamp; another name is *The Supreme Hidden Mystery: The Cavern-Flying Treasure Chapter*. It resides within the Jade Clarity Palace amid the Great Empyrean, formed from the qi of verdant yang, its emptiness reflecting the Nine Heavens. Its azure light is murky and boundless, illuminating the Three Primordial Terraces. Its color is like green jade, its form like the full moon. Within lies the Hollow Mystery Jade Terrace and the Purple Palace, where the Lord of Soul Essence dwells at the center. The text of *The Jade Pendant: The Hidden Scripture of the Great Empyrean* is inscribed upon the southern portico of the Mystic Terrace.

The Scripture states:
To seek long life, first gather from within your body: the moon’s radiance and essence, the sun’s rosy clouds and flower. Turn the Jade Pendant to the left, grasp the Golden Perfected in the right. The Two Effulgences entwine, the Twin Spirits rest in peace. Ascend to the Great Ultimate, descend to the Ten Directions. Firmly preserve the Mystic True, secure the numinous root. The Mystic Valley’s blossoming infant bathes in the luminous treasure. Rinse with the moon, chew the sun, enter the Gate of Heaven. The Golden Perfected pours upward, the Jade Pendant guards the pass. Azure and white divide clearly, reaching my Mud Pill Palace. The treasure-fluid seals essence, refining the body’s spirit to suppleness. The Three Lords stand guard, clad in cinnabar and crimson skirts, pearl-embroidered flowered mantles, flying brocade azure robes, sashes bearing the moon and holding the sun, heads crowned in purple. Seated in the Hall of Light, shaded by the Seven Origins, the Yellow Court’s *wu* and *ji* block and seal the source of evil. Reverently serve the Two Lads—Wu Ying and Bai Yuan—and the Three Elders of Peach Prosperity, who stand at my Gate of Life. Penetrate the Five Palaces, the Twelve Threads, exhale and inhale through the Six Palaces. The soul rejoices, the po delights, repelling the hundred ailments. Dispel heat and banish cold. The Two Effulgences entwine, the myriad spirits rejoice within. Those who illuminate this text ascend in flight to the Southern Portico. Grasping gold and wearing jade, they enter the Mystic Radiance. The Nine Heavens share in the numinous, the Mystic Mother and the Chamber of Yin harmonize. Yin nurtures, yang guides, their colors bright and countenances fresh. Ranked in the Cinnabar Chamber, their names inscribed in the Thearch’s Palace. Thrice circling, ninefold revolving, they merge with the turning of fate.

This Jade Pendant’s treasure text is the scripture of the Great Ultimate’s Mystic True. Those who cultivate it will all soar through the Great Void, roaming freely through the Nine Clarities. Their white tablets will be recorded, their names inscribed in the Eastern Florescence.

The Queen Mother of the West now engraves this text upon the Kunlun Mountains in the Chamber of the Mystic Garden. None but those of pure and empty nature may glimpse or partake of it.

To ascend the body through the Nine Clarities and feast in the radiance of the Southern Portico, turn the Jade Pendant in the Hall of Light, draw the Golden Perfected to the Mud Pill Palace, summon the soul’s true from the Morning Lamp, and call the flying effulgence from the Lord.

For all who practice this Dao, at evening repose, press both hands upon the heart, close the eyes and inwardly contemplate. Draw the Jade Pendant’s verdant yang qi, its light and color murky and boundless like the full moon, empty and reflecting your form, penetrating your entire being.

The Lord of Soul Essence, surnamed Kaiyuan, personal name *(obscured)*, is nine inches in height. His head bears a purple crown, he wears a pearl-embroidered flowered mantle, a robe of flying brocade azure, a sash bearing the moon and holding the sun. He rides a green crow, descending within the azure light to your form, settling in the Mud Pill Palace.

You should click your teeth nine times, swallow saliva twenty-seven times, and silently intone:
*"Mystic Origin, Supreme Numinous, essence of the Nine Celestial Souls, the Morning Lamp shines brightly, congealing the murky azure qi. Named the Jade Pendant, it illuminates the Great Clarity. Bearing the moon and holding the sun, wielding talismans and grasping bells, its flowered light flows brilliantly, suffusing heaven and earth. Riding the green, controlling wings, with cinnabar shafts and purple chariots, first feasting in the Three Primordials, then descending to my form, settling in the Mud Pill Palace, flowing downward to the Yellow Court. Bind the soul, restrain the po, pacify the myriad spirits. The Five Viscera entwine, the Nine Orifices flourish. The Eight Effulgences soar, ascending into Jade Clarity."*

When finished, rub your hands together until warm, press them to your hairline nine times, wipe your eyes fourteen times, swallow qi three times, then lie down. Thus will the soul be at peace and the po tranquil, the myriad spirits guard the palace, the inner numinous qi secure, the outer source of evil sealed. The Eight Effulgences transform, refining the true into immortality.

After nine years, you will perceive the hidden and obscure, foresee the yet-to-be, sit in death or stand in life, face the divine as an equal. After eighteen years, the Dao will be perfected and the true will descend, enabling flight to the Highest Clarity. Without this method, the Three Hun will not be guarded, the Seven Po will not be at peace. The Three Corpses will take flight, the Nine Worms will flee in alarm, attacking within the body, evil spirits penetrating essence. Qi scatters, spirit departs, the body remains impure. In vain you swallow saliva, wasting qi and losing the numinous.

Those who attain this Dao and perfect long life must treasure and secretly cultivate it, for how could their fate be overturned?

The True Unity’s inner spirits transform through the Three Primordials, dividing their qi into nine figures, settling and guarding the Three Palaces—thus each palace has its Three Lords. All are the primal qi of the Jade Treasure of the True Sovereign, born at the inception of the Nine Heavens, coalescing into human form, receiving their names from the Jade Void.

Above, they dwell in the Nine Heavens’ highest realm, beneath the nine-tiered canopy of the Jade Clarity Palace; in the middle, they roam the subtle expanse of the Great Void; below, they govern the Three Palaces within the human body. Without the Three True Ones, the Jade Void would not be clear, the Nine Heavens would not shine, and the Three Luminaries would not glow. Without the Three True Ones in the Great Void, Heaven would have no means to float in emptiness, the Nine Mysteries would have no means to form clouds, the Three Caverns would have no means to attain subtlety, and the Five Peaks would have no means to produce immortals. Without the Three True Ones in the human body, the Three Palaces would lie abandoned, the myriad spirits would scatter, qi would disperse and the true would depart, the Red Child would be disturbed and lost, the Three Corpses would vie for dominance, and the Nine Worms would assail the mind.

Those who know this secret align their truth with the Three Treasures. Its method is profound and weighty—it must not be recklessly disclosed. Unless one ascends the altar, pledges to the spirits, and swears an oath to the Nine Heavens, the sacred names must not be revealed. To transmit it lightly to the unworthy brings retribution upon the errant soul: seven generations of ancestors suffer in the Three Paths, endure the Five Torments upon the Knife Mountain, while the self perishes beneath the Wind Blade, expiating sins at the River Source.

Those who possess the Golden Name and the Imperial Chart, inscribed in the Jade Clarity, having received this secret, must cultivate it in silence. By contemplating it day and night, within three years, the true form will descend, and one will naturally ascend in flight.

Whenever cultivating this Dao, one should bathe and purify oneself on the life-destiny day and the eight solar terms, enter the chamber at the midnight hour, face north, and click the teeth twenty-four times. Recite the *Jade Pendant Mystic Terrace Southern Pavilion Sutra* once. Upon completion, visualize the Jade Pendant’s morning lamp’s *Qingyang* qi, its light and color dim and hazy like the full moon, descending from the Nine Heavens to virtually illuminate the practitioner’s body, enveloping the entire form. Next, visualize the Three Primes’ Nine True inner spirits’ names and appearances, their forms and colors in precise measurements, as described above, ensuring all are clear and accurate. Draw in qi thirty-six times, rise, face the northwest, and bow nine times to the Nine Heavens. Return to face north, and according to the text, ingest the Nine Heavens’ *hun*-spirit golden-script secret characters of the Jade Pendant’s *Yang* talismans in sequence.

Recite the yin incantation:
*"Taiyang* soul-essence, Mystic Supreme Lord, golden pendants gaze upward, jade pendants hold the pass. The two sceneries intertwine, ascending to open the Golden Gate. The three departments’ nine true spirits pacify the spirit and settle the hun-soul. The myriad qi converge, anchoring and guarding the nine sources. The dark truth flows and spreads, green and white distinctly clear. The morning lamp shines brightly, gazing upward to the Imperial Honored One. Record my cinnabar name, swiftly attaining the Upper Immortal. The three departments’ Eight Sceneries, the entire body feathered and gowned, transport me in flight to reach the Jade Dawn."

Upon completion, rub both palms together, wipe the forehead, heart, and below the navel three times each, press the four corners of the eyes three times, and swallow saliva twenty-one times to conclude.

This is the supreme secret Dao, lightly reciting the numinous script to fulfill the duty of the seven ancestors and absolve one’s own calamities.

To the right: the Nine Heavens’ Hun-Soul Essence Golden Script Secret Characters of the Grand Empyrean Yang Talisman, inscribed upon a jade pendant and concealed within the Hidden Mystery Cavern of Flight. This script is the warp and weft of the Nine Heavens, the soaring canopy of Jade Purity. Without this script, Heaven would have no means to float in the Grand Void; Earth would have no means to be clear and empty; humankind would have no means to preserve the bodily form. Thus, the Primordial Beginning carved the script upon jade tablets, naming it the *Jade Purity Golden Script Secret Characters*. Its sound is the inner name of the Heavenly Hun-Soul.

In the first year of the *Shang Kai* era, on the first day of the ninth month, a blue-black crow carried this script and mystically transmitted it to the Queen Mother of the West. Now it is inscribed upon the Dark Garden, where jade lads attend with incense and guard it. The perfected of Supreme Jade Purity all wear this script, thereby attaining rulership as Lords of the Jade Emperor. The Nine Heavens conceal it within the Jasper Terrace, never descending to the mortal world. Those who behold this script find the light of the morning lamp virtually reflected upon their bodies. If one wears this script, the Lesser Lads of the Grand Tenuity bear the Five Charts at the Emperor’s side, the Perfected of the Crimson Palace receive the Five Talismans from the Womb Honored One, merging and transforming within the qi of the Three Primes. One’s form is attained within the light of the morning lamp, one’s name is recorded in the Emperor’s register, and the affliction of the wailing corpse is no more.

Cultivate this Dao, ingest its talisman, and after nine years, the morning lamp will brightly appear upon your form. The Lord Emperor descends into your bedchamber, enabling you to ascend the clouds and mist, roam the Grand Ultimate, repose in the Grand Void, and wander the Great Emptiness. Without a mysterious name on the Cinnabar Terrace or a recorded character in Jade Purity, it must not be lightly transmitted. Unless one possesses a spirit of extraordinary endowment, ascends the Dark Mountain to make a covenant, and arrays gold and azure to swear before the numinous, this script cannot be received, nor its sound heard.

To recklessly divulge it is to incur the punishment of the seven ancestors, bring ruin upon oneself, and suffer the trials of the Three Paths for ten thousand kalpas without redemption. When wearing the script, choose the day of one’s life-destiny and the Grand Year, inscribe the script according to the method, ascend the Dark Mountain, and with blue-gold make an oath before the Nine Heavens, submitting to the Five Numinous Ones. Only then may it be transmitted, with the oral transmission of the sound’s secret. Beware of reckless disclosure—reckless disclosure invites trial and the loss of immortality.

*The Golden Pendant Grand Empyrean Scripture of the Cavern of Flight*

The Golden Pendant is the Nine Heavens’ Po-Soul Spirit, known in the Nine Heavens as *Rainbow Radiance*, also called the *Inner Perfected of the Yin Scenery within the Canopy of Supreme Purity*. Dwelling within the Palace of Supreme Purity amid the Grand Empyrean, it weaves the qi of white mist, virtually reflecting the Nine Heavens. A radiant white light shines brilliantly, penetratingly observing Supreme Purity. Its color is like white clouds, its form like a jade mountain. Above lies the Palace of the Jade Grove, where the Po-Soul Lord Emperor resides. The *Grand Empyrean Hidden Script Golden Pendant Scripture* is within the northern chamber of the Dark Terrace. Its text reads:

To seek flight as an immortal, one must refine the po-soul spirit.
Po-soul and hun-soul essence, both born of the Nine Heavens,
The two sceneries intertwine, the twin spirits luminously clear.
To the right, the golden pendant revolves; to the left, the jade bell turns.
Flowing light fills the Purple Void, illuminating the Perfected of Supreme Purity.
Flying through the Grand Ultimate, descending to the Eight Darks.
Firmly preserve the Dark Truth, safeguarding the radiant infant.
Sun and moon intermingle their effusions, the Dark Valley overflows.
Jade pendants and golden pendants, green and white distinctly clear,
Pacify my Bright Hall, calming the hun-soul and settling the po-soul.
This is called the *Canopy*, the spirit of the Nine Heavens’ Emperor,
Adorned with purple embroidery and pearl sashes, flying silk in cinnabar hues.
Bearing the sun and holding the moon, crowned with radiant essence,
Seated in the Bright Hall, shaded by the Seven Stars.
Above descends the numinous, below attends the Yellow Tranquility.
The Three Elders and Lord Emperors secure my longevity,
Penetrating the stomach duct, the six palaces and five courts.
*Rainbow Radiance* entwines and binds, the myriad spirits guard the form.
Those who obtain this script ascend to fly in Supreme Purity.

This *Golden Pendant Treasure Script* is the *Inner Perfected of the Yin Scenery within Supreme Purity*. Those who cultivate it all ascend the clouds and mist, roam the Grand Ultimate, repose in the Nine Voids, and wander the Purple Emptiness.

The Queen Mother of the West now inscribes this script upon the northern side of the Accumulated Stones of Mount Kunlun. Without the Dark Chart and the Emperor’s writ, or a recorded character on the Cinnabar Terrace, this script cannot be accessed.

Those who wish to soar above the Nine Clouds, move the body within Supreme Purity, revolve the golden pendant in the Muddy Pellet, draw the jade pendant into the Bright Hall, descend the radiant canopy upon *Rainbow Radiance*, and summon the flying scenery from the Lord Emperor—should at the crowing of the cock, before the sky’s light divides, knock the teeth twenty-four times. Visualize the qi of the golden pendant and white clouds, their light and color brilliant as a jade mountain, virtually reflecting your body, penetratingly illuminating your entire form.

The Po-Soul Lord Emperor’s surname is Yin, his given name Hui, his style Yuan. His form is nine inches tall, crowned with a radiant cap, draped in a purple-embroidered pearl sash and flying silk of cinnabar hue. Bearing the moon and holding the sun, he rides a white-feathered luan. Within the white light, he descends into your body, entering the Bright Hall. Then draw in the qi twenty-four times and recite the yin incantation:

Nine Heavens’ Po-Soul Spirit, Primordial Beginning Supreme Perfected,
*Rainbow Radiance* towering, white light like a jade mountain,
Named the Golden Pendant, spirit of the Heavenly Emperor.
Bearing the moon and holding the sun, swiftly riding the white luan,
Above feasting in Jade Purity, entering and exiting the Three Origins.
Descend and revolve within my form, pacifying and guarding the numinous pass.
Restrain the hun-soul and command the po-soul, the myriad spirits rejoice within.
The five viscera bloom with radiance, the numinous and elegant grace the jade countenance.
Urging the clouds to fly, ascending to the Emperor’s celestial court.

Upon completion, rub both palms until warm, wipe the forehead fourteen times, pinch the back of both eyes fourteen times, and swallow saliva fourteen times to conclude. Thus, the golden pendant descends in reflection, the Lord Emperor pacifies and guards, the myriad spirits converge, and the body radiates light. Within nine years, you will fly and ascend to Supreme Purity.

Furthermore, on the first day of the month, and on the days of *jiazi*, the Grand Year, and one’s life-destiny, purify and enter the chamber. Write in white the *Nine Heavens’ Po-Soul Spirit Grand Empyrean Yin Talisman* upon blue paper. At midnight, face north, knock the teeth twenty-four times, and recite the *Golden Pendant Scripture* once. Visualize the light of the golden pendant’s white qi, brilliantly shining and penetratingly clear as a jade mountain, virtually reflecting your body, enveloping your entire form.

Then the adept shall draw in the white light and swallow it twenty-four times to conclude, and ingest the *Grand Empyrean Yin Talisman*. Softly intone the incantation:

*"Mysterious Yin’s sevenfold clouds, the Nine Heavens’ po-soul essence,
Jade Mountain’s radiant splendor, rainbow’s glow illumining Supreme Purity.
Golden pendants and jade girdles, coeval with Heaven’s birth,
The Two Luminaries entwined, descending to enfold my form.
Arrayed and memorialized on the Cinnabar Terrace, inscribed in purple name,
I ascend the flying chariot, traverse the Yellow Flow’s dark expanse,
Soaring through empty space, ascending into the Grotto Court,
To partake of the boundless, equal in numinosity with Heaven."*

When finished, rub the palms until warm, wipe the forehead twenty-seven times, press the outer corners of the eyes fourteen times, and swallow qi twenty-one times to conclude.

**The Supreme Ultimate’s Golden Script Jade Text Nine Perfected Yin Talisman**
To the right: the *Nine Heavens’ Po-Soul Grand Empyrean Yin-Life Upper Luminance Talisman*, inscribed within the golden pendant’s rainbow-reflected yin luminance. This is the pivot of the Nine Heavens’ gates and the canopy of Supreme Purity. Without this script, Heaven would have no means to distinguish day from night; the Great Void would have no means to constitute Supreme Purity. Thus, the Primordial Beginning inscribed this text upon golden tablets, naming it the *Supreme Purity Golden Script Jade Text*. Its sound is the inner name of Heaven’s po-soul.

In the first year of the *Shang Kai* era, on the first day of the ninth month, a blue-black crow carried this text to bestow upon the Queen Mother of the West. Today, it is inscribed upon the northern slopes of the Kunlun’s *Jade Accumulation Stone*, where jade maidens tend the incense and jade perfected ones stand guard. All the perfected of Supreme Purity received it from the Primordial Beginning, wearing it as they roam the palaces of Supreme Purity. The Nine Heavens conceal it within the Jasper Terrace, never transmitting it to the lower world. Whoever beholds this text shall have the golden pendant’s light descend in reflection, their entire body suffused with luminous clarity. Whoever wears this text shall ascend the rainbow-reflected mountain, seated upon the resplendent jade-flowered mat, dissolving the fetal knots at the Jade Pass, extricating the Three Wretched Realms from the Numinous Pavilion, transforming the Nine Talismans to regenerate life, and attaining flight as an immortal recorded in the Emperor’s register.

Cultivate its Dao and ingest its text, and within nine years, the *Po-Soul Emperor Lord*—the Nine Heavens’ Chancellor—shall descend in a cloud chariot drawn by white simurghs to your chamber, bestowing upon you the divine-perfected Dao. The Three Divisions and Eight Luminances shall propel you through empty space, ascending to the Nine Heavens, roaming and feasting upon Jade Mountain. Your dark name shall no longer be inscribed at the northern window; golden script shall be arrayed upon the Cinnabar Terrace. Your predestined fate shall be established before birth, your jade treasury sealed within the purple womb. The yin luminance’s upper tally cannot be recklessly examined, nor the jade tones lightly disclosed. To carelessly divulge or slight this is to forfeit one’s body to the ghostly bureaus, consigning seven generations to servitude, irredeemable for ten thousand kalpas.

To wear this talisman, write it in white upon black silk. On the days of your life-destiny and the Grand Year, ascend the Dark Peak, swear an oath to the Nine Heavens with bronze and gold, and transmit it after invoking the Five Numinosities. The oral transmission of its incantation and sounds shall follow the *Perfected Regulations*. Guard against reckless disclosure, for to do so is to incur the left officials’ wind-blade torments and lose both immortality and life.

The *Po-Soul Emperor Lord* is the Nine Heavens’ Controller of Destinies, governing the po-souls of the Nine Heavens and overseeing the life-calculations of later disciples. The Emperor Lord is enthroned within the Sun Gate’s Golden Court. The *Po-Spirit Emperor Lord* is the Nine Heavens’ Chancellor, presiding over the po-spirits of the Nine Heavens and overseeing the registers of later disciples. He is enthroned within the Moon Palace’s *Linglang* Metropolis.

The Primordial Beginning addressed the Queen Mother of the West, saying: *"To study without knowing that the jade girdle and morning lamp are the Nine Heavens’ hun-souls, that the yang talisman is the qi of primordial generation, and that the golden script’s secret graphs are the Nine Heavens’ hidden names—merely cultivating the* Eight Simplicities Perfected Scripture*,* Numinous Book of Purple Texts*,* ingesting solar and lunar effulgences, and swallowing the flying root—is to ensure that solar essence will not descend, the flowing rosy clouds will not disperse their roots, and one’s efforts will be reduced to guiding qi. The stone luminance cannot be gathered, nor the solar effulgence consumed. The Nine Heavens will not accept your name; the Dark Perfected cannot be attained. The morning lamp cannot be turned, nor the jade girdle revolved. With the Two Luminaries failing to descend, the Muddy Pellet becomes empty and desolate, the myriad spirits take flight, the hun departs, the po scatters, the qi disperses, and the true self is lost. Though one labors with diligent heart, no immortal attainment is gained.*

*To study without knowing that the golden pendant’s rainbow reflection is the Nine Heavens’ po-soul, and that the yin talisman’s golden script and jade text are the inner sounds of the Nine Heavens’ po-soul—merely cultivating the Dao of yellow qi and yang essence’s Three-Five sequential flow—is to ensure that the yellow waters and lunar effulgences cannot be drunk, the youthful countenance cannot be preserved, the flower-like visage cannot long remain fresh, the numinous tones cannot be recited, the golden pendant cannot be revolved, and the Two Luminaries will not descend to the Bright Hall, floating in empty space. The myriad spirits will abandon their abodes, the true luminance will scatter and disperse. Though one labors diligently, no attainment is gained, and one loses immortality to calamity.*

*The foundation of study lies in heeding these words. To not know the* Hun-Soul Emperor Lord’s *taboo name is to dare not recklessly practice the methods of ingesting solar essence. To lightly cultivate it is to have the Nine Heavens’ Controller of Destinies revoke one’s life-calculation, preventing the sun’s descent. Without the yang luminance talisman’s golden script and secret graphs, one must not rashly invoke the Emperor Lord’s taboo name, for to do so is to lightly disturb the Supreme Perfected and incur grave calamity.*

*To not know the* Po-Spirit Emperor Lord’s *taboo name is to dare not lightly cultivate the Dao of ingesting lunar effulgences. To recklessly practice it is to have the Nine Heavens’ Chancellor erase one’s name from the registers, preventing the moon’s descent. Without the yin luminance talisman’s golden script and jade text, one must not rashly invoke the Emperor Lord’s taboo name, for to violate this is to suffer yin torments and lose immortality.*

*In cultivating the Supreme Dao—swallowing rosy clouds, ingesting qi, and partaking of the sun and moon—one must first practice the talismans of the jade girdle and golden pendant, the yin and yang Two Luminaries, and visualize the inner spirits of the Three Origins and Nine Perfected, as well as the august presences of the hun and po Emperor Lords. Only then may one summon the radiance of the sun and moon. From dawn to dusk, whether sitting, rising, lying, or resting, one must constantly visualize the sun above the head, the moon within the mouth, the* Hun-Soul Emperor Lord *in the Muddy Pellet, and the* Po-Spirit Emperor Lord *in the Bright Hall. With heart concentrated and eyes fixed in visualization, ever maintaining this semblance, within a year, the true form shall manifest, and the blue and white [of the sun and moon] shall become distinct. In nine years, one shall be able to ride empty space in flight, ascending to the Morning Lamp’s Hall and roaming the rainbow-reflected mountain."*

**Morning Rites to the Nine Heavens’ Hun-Po Emperor Lords for Ascension to Immortality**

On the third, ninth, and sixteenth days of each lunar month at dawn, face the sun and perform nine bows and nine salutations—or simply bow in the heart. Lift the head, click the teeth twenty-four times, and softly intone the prayer:

*"Celestial Hun, ninefold coiled,
August Divine of the Supreme,
Essence of the sun’s great yang,
Golden Gate’s immortal change—
This humble one, [Name], ventures to present these words.
Today I make my supplication,
Eight wishes laid before thee:
Grant this rite’s petition,
Look down with dark grace.
Azure Dragon and Vermilion Phoenix,
Chariot of purple carriage,
Five clouds interlaced in shade,
Six qi fanning the dust,
Lofty and bending, the Three Lights descend in truth,
The Two Radiant Ones entwine me.
My Dao rejoices,
Heart bright, ears keen,
Eyes clear, complexion fresh,
Body light, bones ascending,
Face blooming with splendor,
Feathered raiment taking form,
Soaring to the Emperor’s Dawn."*

Conclude by lifting the head to draw in the sun’s essence, swallowing forty-five times.

Practicing this for three years, the eyes will see with penetrating clarity, gazing into the boundless. The face will bear a golden countenance, the body will generate jade-like fluids. After nine years, one shall walk without shadow, soaring through the empty void.

If the sky is overcast and the sun unseen, perform this in a secluded chamber with focused visualization—it will still resonate with the natural order.

On the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each lunar month at the hour of *rending* (midnight), face the moon and perform nine bows and nine salutations—or simply bow in the heart. Lift the head toward the moon, click the teeth sixteen times, and pray:

*"Hun-essence, Po-spirit,
Born together in the Nine Heavens,
Stone Radiance, Water Mother,
Great Yin’s luminous clarity,
Wandering the Moon Palace,
Refining in the Golden Court,
The Two Radiant Ones merge their origin,
The hour is most auspicious, the time pure.
Eight gatherings intertwine,
I manifest and attain perfection.
Grant me light, grant me countenance,
Grant me freshness, grant me glory,
Grant me spirit, grant me immortality,
Soaring to the Upper Clarity."*

Conclude by lifting the head to draw in the moon’s essence, swallowing forty-five times.

**The Precious Scripture of the Dark Perfected’s Cavern-Flight and the Two Radiant Ones**

In cultivating the Dao of the Great Empyrean, the method of revolving the Golden Pendants and Jade Girdles must be paired with the absorption of the sun and moon’s essence to refine the spirits of the Five Embryos. Summon the Five Emperors of the sun’s midst and the Ladies of the moon, so that the Two Radiant Ones’ mysterious reflections descend into one’s form. The face will acquire a jade-like luster, the body will generate wondrous light, inner and outer brilliance will be fully illuminated, and the heart and eyes will become keen. Only then may the Jade Girdles be grasped and the Golden Pendants revolved.

The Hun-Po Emperor Lords will rest in your chamber, and the light of the Morning Lamp and rainbow-reflected mountain will be swiftly ascended.

The *Scripture of the Dark Perfected* states:
*"The Supreme’s profound profundity,
Dual spirits, Fourfold Clarity,
Dark Perfected’s inner radiance,
Bright Hall’s outer purity.
Swallowing the breath of the Two Lights,
Longevity’s spirit essence,
Ascending to assist the Controller of Destinies,
Overseeing the myriad spirits.
Six blossoms fill and overflow,
Penetrating vision of the Yellow Tranquility."*

These forty characters were inscribed by the Supreme on the southern eaves of the Phoenix Terrace. They are not taught to those who are not disciples of the Perfected Assembly, nor transmitted to those not chosen by the Controller of Destinies.

To cultivate the Dark Perfected method, visualize and ingest the sun and moon within the mouth: during the day, visualize the sun; at midnight, visualize the moon. Alternatively, one may visualize without distinction between day and night. The sun is red in color, the moon yellow. The sun has nine rays of purple light, the moon ten rays of white light. Position the sun and moon opposite the mouth, nine feet apart, their rays directed toward the mouth, straight as a bowstring, entering therein.

Further visualize at the center of the sun and moon a woman wearing a purple headscarf and a crimson brocade robe and skirt. She calls herself the Supreme Dark Perfected’s Cinnabar Cloud Jade Maiden, with the taboo name *Chanxuan* and the style *Mizhen*. From her mouth issues a red qi that fills the space between the sun and moon’s rays, merging with the radiant clouds to pour entirely into your mouth. You swallow it, and she too exhales it. Perform this ninety times.

Visualize the radiance of the sun and moon closely pressing upon your face, the Jade Maiden’s mouth placed over yours, allowing her qi and fluids to descend into your mouth. Then softly intone the prayer:

*"Great Empyrean’s Purple Perfected,
Bright Hall’s yin spirit,
Essence of the sun and moon’s radiance,
Jade Maiden Chanxuan,
First born of emptiness,
Whose style is Mizhen,
Head crowned with purple blossoms,
Lotus spirit diadem,
Body draped in brocade,
Crimson flying skirt,
Emerging from the sun, entering the moon,
Heavenly light’s subtle fragrance,
Mouth exhaling crimson qi,
Irrigating my Three Origins.
Face close to the Celestial Well,
Softening the po, restraining the hun,
Dark fluid flowing,
Embryonic essence ever whole,
Five viscera blooming,
Opening the childlike, reversing age,
Overseeing the myriad spirits,
Controller of Destinies’ flying immortal."*

Conclude by visualizing the Jade Maiden’s mouth fluids pouring into your mouth. Rinse and swallow them, repeating ninety times.

Calm the heart and focus the mind; practice diligently, without limit. When visualizing the sun, do not visualize the moon, and vice versa—they must be equally cultivated. If unable to ingest at the proper time, visualize the Two Radiant Ones returning to the Bright Hall, the sun on the left and the moon on the right, their brilliance aligned with the eyes, their combined illumination reflecting the Four Directions and the Two Qi, allowing mutual infusion.

Alternatively, one may constantly visualize the sun and moon within the Bright Hall, not only during the usual times of ingesting the Two Radiant Ones’ essences, but employing them together.

After five years of practice, the Supreme Dark Jade Maiden will descend to you and converse. She may also divide her form into dozens of Jade Maidens, ready to be commanded. This is the accumulation of resonance and the congealing of essence, giving rise to manifest visions—the utmost of refinement, the wondrous response of resonance.

The above is the Dao of the Sun’s Rosy Clouds and Moon’s Essence, the method of drawing in the Two Radiant Ones, enabling one to attain spirit communion and Perfected truth, the body generating jade-like radiance, commanding the myriad spirits, and ascending to the Emperor’s chamber.

Those whose names are not recorded in the Emperor’s register, whose jade slips are not in the *Fangzhu*, and whose purple cords are not bound to the Perfected—such persons shall never behold the Dark Scripture or chant the numinous verses. Those who see it shall have a lifespan equal to the Three Lights; those who wear it shall soar to the Upper Clarity; those who cultivate it shall become Perfected Ones.

The Way is arcane and wondrous, not transmitted to the lower world. In ancient times, the Perfected Lord of Mount Zhong taught this method of the Mysterious True to the Great Yu—though only an abridged copy, omitting the original’s intricate details of spiral binding. The Perfected Lord now serves as the Forbidden Custodian of the Nine Heavens, yet has not attained the rank of Imperial Perfected. The Great Yu, too, presides as the administrative overseer of the Mysterious Mountain, governing the capital of the Five Peaks. Both cultivated the Way of the Mysterious True, gradually ascending the steps of Jade Clarity.

The Perfected King of the Western Citadel received it from the Queen Mother of the West and now seals one copy within the Western Citadel Mountain. The Most High has decreed that the Left Office shall assist with the jade pendants, and the Right Office with the golden earrings. Should one leak the sacred scripture, they shall be punished with the Wind Blade, their seven ancestors condemned to toil, hauling stones to fill rivers, while their living souls bear the lash, causing them to lose the scripture of their own accord.

Those whose golden names are recorded in the Upper Clarity, whose refined cinnabar resonates with the Nine Heavens, shall behold this scripture and be granted twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens to attend their person, tending incense and summoning the Perfected to dispel flying calamities.

When transmitting the scripture, master and disciple shall face each other in purification for a hundred days—or thirty days. The disciple shall offer two taels of gold, forty bolts of azure silk, and ninety bolts of white silk, then swear an oath before transmission. This follows the method of oath-taking and invocation as prescribed in the *Statutes of the Great Perfected*. To transmit lightly without an oath is to invite the Left Office’s judgment upon both master and disciple, condemning their seven ancestors to the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, never to be absolved for ten thousand kalpas. Be solemn and cautious in its practice.

Here ends the *Scripture of the Jade Pendant and Golden Earring, the Golden Writ of the Supreme Ultimate*.
