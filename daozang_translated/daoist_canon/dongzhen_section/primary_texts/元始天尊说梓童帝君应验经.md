**The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Sutra of Manifest Responses of Lord Zitong**

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning resided within the Jade Capital Mountain of the Palace of Radiant Clarity in the Heaven of Luminous Darkness. He wove a canopy of five-colored clouds, leading the assembly of celestial immortals. The sun, moon, and stars shone with dazzling brilliance, while mountains, rivers, ghosts, and spirits joined hands in praise, saying: "We, who dwell in the turbid world of dust and defilement, rarely encounter the compassion of Heaven. May it broadly awaken us."

Then, Lord Zitong advanced with dignified steps, prostrated twice before the Heavenly Worthy, knelt, and spoke: "Your disciple, through kalpas uncounted, has lost his original body and been exiled to the land of Shu. I reflect upon the myriad trials of the mortal realm—some born among birds and beasts, others dwelling among barbarians. Distinctions of wealth and poverty abound; they suffer disasters of flood, fire, and warfare, endure the torments of cyclic rebirth, and remain unaware of Heaven and Earth, sun, moon, and stars. They slander the teachings, disrespect the Three Treasures, teachers, and parents. Though they may enjoy fleeting happiness, they inevitably fall into the Five Destinies and Three Wretched Realms, revolving through kalpas without awakening. Witnessing these people suffer manifold retributions, I now encounter the Heavenly Worthy’s descent. I pray you proclaim the Dharma to dispel their ignorance."

At that moment, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning emanated a radiant light from his brow, illuminating ten thousand miles. The assembly of celestial immortals, along with the deities of the heavens above, the earth below, the waterways, and the hells, each took their places within the lapis lazuli and five-colored realms to hear the Dharma proclaimed.

The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning said: "Excellent! O Imperial Son, you compassionately contemplate sentient beings and expound these karmic causes, seeking to awaken their hearts. The alternation of yin and yang, the movement of sun and moon, the flow and concealment of stars, the collapse of lands—all belong to the transformations of Heaven.

"Common folk, born between Heaven and Earth, receive the qi of yin and yang, are perfected by the Five Phases, and formed by the union of the Two Qi. Yet they know not the rarity of the human body, the preciousness of birth in the Central Land. Envy, greed, and avarice fill them, and they remain ignorant of repentance. Thus, they suffer the calamities of warfare, pestilence, flood, and fire—all arising from this.

"I, your servant, bow my head and implore the Heavenly Worthy: The people endure disasters and misfortunes, yet none pity or heed them. How may they be absolved?"

The Heavenly Worthy, leaning upon his armrest, replied: "You, who assist in the governance of the Vast Heaven, share the august rank of the Great Unity, your name exalted in the Southern Culmen, your virtue extending to the Four Quarters. You oversee the revolutions of the Primordial Unity and administer the official ranks and emoluments of the flowing stream. The Six Registers are all examined, the Five Peaks all informed. Contemplating these mortal beings, you should deliver them."

Then the Heavenly Worthy proclaimed a hymn of praise:

Thus the Primordial Worthy,
Enthroned within lapis lazuli,
Pities the evils of sentient beings,
Who flow from the Three Wretched Realms to the Five Destinies.
Vast and unknowing, they remain,
Ever as the sun and moon wane.
Unmindful of the Five Phases they receive,
The stars govern their transitions.

At that time, Lord Zitong,
From his seat, proclaimed compassion.
Manifesting transformations through his person,
Revealing samādhi within his brush.
Dispelling misfortune and opening the gate,
He conversed at the Jade Capital’s armrest.
Gazing below at the people of the world,
Enduring suffering without end.
Unawakened and unknowing,
Now I urge you to repent.
Listen, sentient beings, to this guidance,
The Five Peaks hold no obstructions.
The Wheel-Turning Lord delivers from suffering,
Hell holds no escape.
Fortune and misfortune both transmitted,
Good and ill foretold in advance.
Cherish life and uphold the Great Dao,
Compassion removes harm.
Forever open the gate of immortal teachings,
Abiding by the teachings is supreme."

He further intoned:

"The register of official ranks is your charge,
Literary arts are your perfection.
Should one seek the path to office,
They rely on you as the balance.
Good and evil determine fortune and misfortune,
Understanding lies in karmic causes.
Wield the brush to record truthfully,
Prosperity and decline are no accident.
With merit comes reward,
Without goodness, no partiality.
The heavens praise this as good—
How else may one ascend?"

When the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning had finished speaking this sutra, he addressed Lord Zitong: "You reside in the heart of Western Shu, atop Phoenix Mountain, manifesting numinous signs in the mortal realm, all taking form. You observe the conduct and concealment of the ninety-four transformations, reveal the changes of billions of kalpas, hold the office of delivering from suffering, and govern fortune and misfortune in the Four Quarters. Hear my few words to augment even the smallest goodness, and with reverence respond to compassion."

Lord Zitong then knelt in gratitude, bowed again before the Heavenly Worthy, and said: "Your servant now encounters this compassion and vows to deliver the people. Not a single affair shall escape my brush, not a single person shall remain unsaved by my manifestations. Together, we uphold the Great Dao to inspire cherishing of life, and I pray the Heavenly Countenance will open the path of expedient means."

Thereupon, the assembly of celestial immortals each voiced their praise.

They again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, entreating that the sutra be entrusted to the world for recitation, to dispel disasters and misfortunes.

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Excellent! Excellent! Those who recite it shall have a hundred blessings arrive, their descendants prosper, and their lives flourish. Those who slander it shall bring calamity upon nine generations and extend misfortune to themselves."

Then the assembly of celestial immortals proclaimed a hymn:

Silent and profound, the human path,
Dim and distant, the foolish.
Today, beholding the Heavenly Worthy’s teachings,
The foolish are freed from anger and delusion.

When this hymn was finished, the assembly of celestial immortals and Lord Zitong bowed again before the Heavenly Worthy, paid their respects, and withdrew, faithfully receiving and upholding the teachings.

**Thus concludes *The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Sutra of Manifest Responses of Lord Zitong*.**
