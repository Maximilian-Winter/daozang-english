# 太上洞真贤门经

*The Supreme Cavern of Perfection and the Gate of the Worthy Sutra*

At that time, the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the divine forms of the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, along with one hundred and eighty Dao Lords and one thousand two hundred Venerable Lords. If one were to broadly recite the names of the Heavenly Worthies from former kalpas, their number would be as countless as motes of dust, and even if one were to recite them for an entire kalpa, they could not be exhausted. Now, only the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions who attained the Dao in the present kalpa are spoken of—those whose responsive manifestations bear five hundred and seventy-three names. To pay homage, praise, and extol them brings merit beyond compare.

Whether man or woman, whoever hears this *Sutra of the Venerable Lords and the Gate of the Worthy*, even a single phrase or verse, shall obtain blessings of fortune and longevity, eradicate the grave transgressions of the three karmic actions, and accrue boundless virtues—so manifold they cannot be fully recounted or recorded. With but a snap of the fingers in reverent prostration, one responds with devotion, upholding the sacred teachings.

Then, the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected One of Universal Salvation of the East and the assembled immortals, saying: Within the boundless realm of the Nine Qi of the East, there are one hundred Heavenly Worthies whose responsive manifestations bear divine names. Now, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and take refuge in them:

Bowing to the ground, with utmost sincerity, we repent.
Again, we repent.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: All sentient beings, in casting off and assuming bodies, sink into the sea of suffering, passing through kalpas without number, unable to attain liberation. All this arises from the grave sins committed by mind and mouth, the three karmas and ten evils, which stain and entangle the voice-hearers. Desiring to seek liberation and realize the fruit of eternal bliss, to depart from the three paths, the five sufferings, and the eight difficulties, we beseech their dissolution. Having eradicated these sins, we prostrate and repent without limit.

With utmost sincerity, prostrate and take refuge in the Supreme Heavenly Worthy, and again repent the sin of killing.
Since time without beginning until this day, we have abandoned our parents, siblings, and the six relations, both past and present, without thought of compassion. Some have engaged in warfare, slaying enemies; some have served as officials, crafting deceptive documents and perverse judgments, wronging the upright; some, through jealousy, have severed lives, induced abortions, or harmed beings with poison, killing and consuming all manner of creatures. Some, for the sake of parents, ourselves, brothers, or kin, have gathered in villages and towns to feast upon living beings; some, in marrying sons or daughters, celebrating the third day or the full moon; some, in sacrificing to spirits and ghosts, have slaughtered countless beings—killing oxen, sheep, donkeys, horses, pigs, dogs, geese, ducks, and all manner of livestock; or slaying deer, foxes, hares, tigers, leopards, jackals, wolves, and all manner of wild beasts; or killing blood-containing birds and magpies; or killing turtles, alligators, fish, and tortoises. Such sins are without limit. Today, with shame and utmost sincerity, we repent them all.

Then, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected One of Extended Life in the South and the host of immortals, saying: In the boundless Brahmā-gas world of the South, there are ninety-nine Heavenly Worthies whose numinous images and names now require our utmost sincerity in prostration and refuge:

From kalpas immeasurable until this very day, we have killed living beings and harmed lives beyond count. We have slaughtered creatures to sacrifice to ghosts and spirits, severed their heads and limbs, singed off their fur and skin, and seared them in raging fires. We have torn asunder the bonds of parent and child, cut short the lives of the unborn. We have deliberately severed the root of life, causing annihilation—wrongfully killing the worthy, Daoist masters, and common men and women. We have slain creditors, enemies, and good people from the four directions. We have killed through poison, through potions, through curses, through verbal abuse, through self-destruction, and by instructing others to kill. We have rejoiced in witnessing such acts, raising our hands or moving our thoughts to inflict countless harms. For sins such as these, boundless and infinite, today we openly confess and repent them all.

All of us, from kalpas immeasurable until this day, in body and mind, have constantly committed theft of others’ property—whether by cunning means, coercion, unlawful seizure, deception, or unpaid debts; whether through fraud or evasion of repayment. Whatever is not our own—flowers, fruits, grasses, trees, a single blade or leaf—if we harbor even a single thought toward it, it is theft. Even what is found on the road, encountered in the wild, blown by the wind, carried by birds, or scattered from carts and horses—silk, cloth, rice, wheat, the tiniest speck—regardless of quantity, through kalpas immeasurable, we have concealed it within ourselves, never having confessed. Now, having repented, we extinguish the sins of accumulated kalpas, and through ten thousand kalpas, our seven generations of ancestors, past and present parents, and all six relations may receive deliverance.
May each of us have descendants flourishing and prosperous, with grain and silk in abundance.
May our dwellings be pure and auspicious, our families through generations clad in robes of office.
Today, with shame and remorse, we repent all these transgressions.

Thereupon, the Most High Lord Lao universally addressed the Most Supreme Heavenly Worthies: The sins of licentiousness and the like cannot be exhaustively recounted in their causes and conditions. They may involve separating mother and child, severing others’ bonds of love, disrupting others’ tender affections, disregarding beauty or ugliness, failing to distinguish between kin and stranger, or coercing others’ sons and daughters to harmonize yin and yang. Such acts expose the body to the Three Luminaries, encroach upon the Four Classes, indulge the ears in lewd sounds, the eyes in observing dark and bright hues, the nose in receiving fragrant scents, the mouth in craving rich flavors, and the body in desiring soft textures. Sins such as these are boundless and immeasurable, binding body and mind. Today, with utmost sincerity, we earnestly pray and repent them all. All here snap their fingers, prostrate in reverence, and together form karmic connections, each receiving a thousand springs and sharing in the blessings of good fortune. We bow again and proceed accordingly.

Here ends *The Worthy Gate Sutra of the Most High Grotto of the Real*.
