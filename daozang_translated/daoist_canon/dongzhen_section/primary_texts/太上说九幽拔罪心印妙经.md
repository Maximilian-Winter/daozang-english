**The Supreme Lord’s Wondrous Scripture of the Heart Seal for Deliverance from the Nine Hells**

At that time, the Primordial Celestial Worthy sat upon a seven-jeweled dais, radiating great luminosity that illumined the three thousand great thousandfold worlds. Beholding sentient beings enduring manifold sufferings, drowning in the cycle of birth and death, and receiving endless retribution, the Perfected One of Salvation arose from his seat, gazed reverently upon the Celestial Worthy’s countenance, knelt in obeisance, and inquired:

“By what causes and conditions do these sentient beings drift upon the bitter sea, sinking without end?”

The Celestial Worthy replied: “Such beings suffer all manner of evil karma, all arising from their own minds. Deluded and inverted in thought, they fail to awaken to non-action. All roots of sin arise from the mind; the joys of heaven are born of the mind’s freedom, and the sinking into the Three Realms likewise arises from the mind.

When the mind gives rise to perverse views, deluded thoughts and anger arise. When the mind is confused and disordered, false notions take hold. When the mind harbors killing and harm, it receives manifold forms of existence. When the mind is deceitful and crooked, it shares no affinity with the Dao. When the mind is empty and still, it draws near to the Dao.”

Reiterating this meaning, he proclaimed a gatha:

The Great Dao is vast and clear,
Its primordial principle profound and obscure.
Born before heaven, it governs past and present.
The Dao has no form or body,
Yet clarifies body and mind.
No greed, no desire,
No anger, no lust.
Right and wrong are unrecognized,
Yet within and without, one seeks.
Body and mind pure and still,
Afflictions cannot invade.
No arising, no ceasing,
Abstruse and unfathomable.
Serene, empty, and quiescent,
The original mind is realized.
Naturally in accord with the Dao,
All sages come to revere.
Ascending to the Golden Towers,
Roaming the celestial groves.
Seven generations of ancestors are liberated,
Forever escaping the dark shades.
All align with the Heart Seal,
Awakening to the Dao and uniting with the Real.
Thought after thought in succession,
Let no dust-mind arise.

At that time, the suffering sentient beings who heard this wondrous scripture were all delivered. The assembled perfected beings bowed in reverence, rejoicing greatly, extolling and praising, and vowed to uphold the teachings.

**Thus concludes *The Supreme Lord’s Wondrous Scripture of the Heart Seal for Deliverance from the Nine Hells*.**
