**Edict of the Celestial Bureau for Verifying Scriptures**

The Bureau below, where the Dao abides in tranquil stillness,
Seeks to emulate the most arduous of deliberations;
Its boundless divine efficacy transcends mere description.

All praises and commendations are but to guide and lead the way,
Yet over time, discrepancies in recitation and transcription have arisen,
Causing discrepancies among the transmissions of the Immortals.
Moreover, with the passage of countless years,
The spoken and written forms have strayed from their original truth.
How could one blame the fish for resembling the *Ru* script,
Or the crow for being mistaken for a horse?
Without verification, errors inevitably persist.

Thus, the command is issued to the literati,
To scrutinize and cross-examine the sacred texts.

**Zhang Liang, Tian Shu’s Senior Advisor,**
Long devoted to scholarly pursuits,
Now oversees the Celestial Bureau.
Having already performed transformations in the Southern Realm,
And issued scriptures to guide mortals below,
He is now entrusted with the duty of critical examination,
And doubly honored for his contributions to verification,
To ensure the faithful recitation of the text by mortals,
And to reveal the profound mysteries of the Heavenly Scriptures.
Let all errors be rectified, and perfection achieved.

Ah! The Dao is transmitted through the heart,
Its profound insight lies beyond mere words;
Yet its meaning is revealed through speech,
And advancement in cultivation must begin within the scriptures.
Thus, let there be redoubled diligence in examination,
So as not to betray the trust of the compilers.
Moreover, let the path of inquiry be clearly stated,
Illuminating the stages of attainment for the aspirants.
May sincere disciples thereby seek the Mysterious,
And virtuous scholars attain the Way through this,
Turning from their vulgarity and returning to purity.

Upon completion of this report,
It shall await imperial approval for dissemination.

This edict is hereby issued—
**Strictly adhere to its commands.**

**Rightfully received by the Three Pure Ones’ decree,**
As per the previous decree, now confirmed.
**Year, Month, Day**
**Issued by Lin Shaohua, the Receiver.**

「Your Majesty’s gracious decree has been duly received,
Yet I, the humble **Liang**, dare to decline the weighty task of examining and revising the *Sutra of the Jade Emperor*.

I humbly submit: Yesterday, I respectfully obeyed Your Majesty’s wise edict,
Entrusting me with the duty of scrutinizing the *Sutra of the Jade Emperor*.
Yet the Dao’s subtleties are beyond mere words,
How could they be fully expounded through speech alone?
The scriptures illuminate eternal teachings,
But first, their profound elucidation must be meticulously declared.

This truth is clear to all who comprehend it.
I earnestly consider how to uphold the scriptures’ logic,
Never daring to exceed their bounds.

Moreover, common folk, once accustomed to old ways,
Find change difficult to accept.
If I were to alter even a single word,
The masses would surely harbor doubt.

Thus, I should not deviate from the established text,
Lest I invite further speculation.

Alas, my own mediocrity and dim wit
Are unworthy of such sacred scriptures.
I risk the punishment of the cauldron and tripod,
Yet humbly lay bare my heartfelt plea.

I tremble in awe and terror,
Bowing my head repeatedly.
Again, I reflect upon my lowly birth and humble station,
A vulgar servant in this corrupt age.
By fortune, I have been shaped by my teachers and mentors,
And granted ascent into the ranks of the immortals.
Though my nature is coarse and unrefined,
I now hold authority over pivotal matters.
Day and night, I ponder in fear,
Seeking only to perform my duties inadequately,
And escape blame through sheer effort.

Yet Your Majesty’s benevolent decree is as gentle as spring sunlight,
Warm and harmonious in tone.
Your profound edict is magnanimous and serene,
Not like the sternness of autumn frost.
You entrust me with this grave responsibility,
To apply my clumsy skills to its sacred interpretation.

But who among these benighted and incompetent ones
Is worthy of such a task?

The sacred words already encompass ultimate truth,
While the true scriptures have long been obscured by mortal minds.
If I were to change them now,
How could the people fully trust them?

I deeply fear that the ignorant and vulgar
May harbor disbelief, scoffing at the sacred texts,
And bring down great calamity upon myself.
Not only would my lowly self face reproach for failing in duty,
But I would also suffer the shame of marring this precious text.

The matter has reached this point—
There is room for reconsideration.

I, the foolish one, pray that Your Majesty’s wisdom may pierce my darkness,
That Your discerning gaze may recognize my hidden sincerity,
And that You may take pity upon my humble plea.
Perhaps You would grant me release from this heavy burden,
Or commission a more capable scholar,
A towering figure of wisdom and might,
To undertake this examination,
So that no further objections may arise.

I, Liang, having received the imperial decree,
Dare to voice my reckless words,
Not to defy Your Majesty’s favor,
But to pour forth my earnest desires.
My crime is deserving of ten thousand deaths.

I humbly beseech the Three Pure Ones,
That Your decree may be issued from Your sovereign heart,
And proclaimed to all within and beyond,
So that I may strive to uphold my duties,
And repay Your gracious kindness.

I, Liang, having dared to challenge Your Majesty’s authority,
Feel my heart quake with boundless trepidation and fear.
Bowing my head repeatedly,
I respectfully submit this petition for Your edict.
Awaiting Your imperial decree.

Respectfully submitted.
**Year, Month, Day**
**Liang** presents his memorial.

**The Three Pure Ones’ Second Decree**
All that Liang has petitioned is fully understood.»

「Your Excellency’s learning encompasses the hundred schools, and Your Dao/Way ranks among the sages. You have already received the office of guiding sentient beings, and long held the authority to expound sacred texts.

Reflecting upon the people of the Southern Continent, they have long revered Your teachings of profound principles. Yet the *Benxing Jijing* [1] contains errors and inconsistencies, and the common folk below all cling to their own confused doubts. Thus, I propose Your selection and careful examination.

It is fitting that You now shoulder the responsibility of Your previous brilliance and again humbly deliver this request. Do not dismiss this modest plea; may You fulfill Your duty with earnestness. Therefore, I issue this second decree, which You must reverently accept.

The *Yuhuang Benxingjing* [2] is the essence of the utmost truth, the profound intent of the sages. Within its words, it contains the marvelous Dao/Way of the One True Principle and demonstrates the path to liberation in the midst of its praises. Its language and meaning intertwine, its teachings and affairs merge. Within its speech, it embraces the true and mysterious; within its discourse, it unfolds the subtlest wonders, with nothing concealed.

Those who taste its words find divine harmony with the Great Unity; those who recite it transcend all defilements. Its divine efficacy and wondrous applications are vast and immeasurable; its lofty principles and luminous insights encompass all without exception.

Yet because sentient beings are burdened with heavy obstructions and the common multitude lacks true discernment, they merely chase after literal interpretations, failing to grasp the essence of its words. They fear only the scriptures’ authority, unaware that true liberation lies beyond superficial rewards. Sacred texts reveal extraordinary signs, but profound truths reside in the One True Principle.

How can one abandon the refined for the crude, or cling to the coarse while forsaking the marvelous? Only then will one align with the Heavenly Lord’s original intent and silently accord with the Emperor’s sovereign will.

By advancing in practice, one may swiftly transcend this defiled world; by ascending in realization, one may join the ranks of the pure and luminous. Thus, one may attain the *Qingwei Tian* [3] and ascend to the Hall of Light, without needing the Heavenly Lord’s wondrous voice to re-emerge, nor seeking His path to wander freely, possessing the Six Spiritual Powers and achieving Great Freedom.

This is where one first earns the name of *shixin* [4] (true reception) and where one truly earns the title of *shouchi* [5] (sacred recitation). If one spreads these words far and wide without delving into the intent of the One True Principle, or if the Six Roots [6] wander without encountering the path to liberation, then such efforts can never repay the Heavenly Lord’s labor in expounding this scripture, nor gain the Emperor’s merit in protecting it.

Let those who revere and believe in this text redouble their efforts in upholding it, reciting with mouth and storing in heart as if dwelling within the radiant light. Let their spirits merge and minds converse as if wandering through the Jewel Park. Contemplating the divine powers of *Fenshen Heshen* [7] (divided and unified bodies), silently reflecting on the wondrous applications of *Yinghua Yingwu* [8] (responding transformations and manifestations), they will stand serene and unencumbered, with lofty confidence.

Thus, they may naturally ascend to the Celestial Palaces and be recorded among the sacred texts. I, Liang, having received Your enlightened decree, will now praise this Jewel Scripture. Respectfully, I first reveal its coarse interpretations in my humble words, to proclaim them to the present age.

As for the teachings on acquiring merit and the detailed explanations of divine retribution, these are already fully recorded in the scripture and need no further elaboration.

But regarding the unfolding of ultimate principles and correcting erroneous texts, though I lack the ability to err, I am guided by Your gracious decree. Having already declined with humility, I now dare not refuse this modest request. I will carve away and refine this heart, scrutinize it below, and first speak these words, establishing them in the scripture. Thus, future readers may recognize the original intent of its accounts.

I, Liang, bow my head repeatedly and respectfully write this with clasped hands.

**Volume One: Chapter One – The Divine Powers of the Qingwei Celestial Palace**
Dao/Way’s words [9]: The Primordial Heavenly Lord, in days past, ascended to the Qingwei Celestial Palace, within the *Yujing* [10] and *Jinquè* [11] of the Seven Treasures, in the Mysterious Jewel Park, to the Hall of Radiant Light. There, He expounded the path of *Lingbao Qingjing Zhenyi Bu’er* [12] (Soul Jewel of Purity, True Unity Without Duality) to countless beings beyond measure.

The *Yingyun Shufa Zhang* [13] has already been carefully examined, with no discrepancies or errors.

I humbly state: The marvels of the Great Dao/Way begin from the beginningless and end in the endless. Its forms cannot be confined by vessels, nor can its manifestations be grasped by perception. The Three Realms [14] are all shaped and conditioned; how then could one attain this Dao/Way?

I reverently ponder that the Primordial Heavenly Lord knew the Dao/Way’s lofty mysteries, pitied the sentient beings’ ignorance, and in response to the cosmic mandate, He expounded the law and revealed it, so that all beings in the Three Realms might seek this path. Thus, even the confused and the sluggish may enter the gate of Purity, True Unity, and return to the domain of Natural Emptiness.

The assembled truths of this scripture sought to record the Heavenly Lord’s deeds of expounding the law, hence this chapter is placed first.

Though this scripture, from beginning to end, purely recounts the Emperor’s divine transformations and the marvels of His creation, the intent of its compilation is to directly point to the expounding of the *Lingbao Qingjing Zhenyi Bu’er* (Soul Jewel of Purity, True Unity Without Duality) path. Without profound insight and the mind-seal of true understanding, who could ever attain this?

The reverent and exalted *Xuanhua* (宣化) teachings are honored, to be conveyed to those who come after.
May the Heavenly Lord of Supreme Virtue graciously inspect and approve.

Your humble subject, Liang, speaks with utmost care.

At that time, the Emperor of Jade, the Heavenly Lord, together with the myriad divine saints—among them the *Yuanji* (原始) Cloud Heaven True Flying Saints, the *Wujie* (无极) Divine Kings, the *Lingtong* (灵童) Divine Boys, and the *Yunü* (玉女) Divine Girls numbering nine hundred million—observed a solemn fast and established ritual purity, standing in attendance at His side.

The *Chengji Yuhui* (乘机与会) chapter has already been meticulously verified, with no discrepancies found.

Your humble subject, Liang, respectfully states:
The Heavenly Lord’s mind is singular without duality, His deeds harmonious yet undivided.
Thus, when the Heavenly Lord ascended the *Qianbao Xuan Yuan* (七宝玄苑) of Seven Treasures and took His seat upon the Radiant Seat, preparing to expound the scripture, He did not first utter a single cryptic word, but rather issued a decree and summons.

Then, the Emperor of Jade, in perfect accord with the Heavenly Lord’s silent intent, gathered the great saints in unspoken unity—was this not the embodiment of a singular mind without duality, and deeds in harmony yet undivided?

Yet I fear that the beings of the lower realms may not grasp this truth.
Thus, I dare to convey this message.
May the Heavenly Lord of Supreme Virtue graciously inspect and approve.
Your humble subject, Liang, speaks with utmost care.

Thus, when the Emperor of Jade perceived that the appointed time had arrived, he immediately displayed the Six Transcendent Powers before the assembly, emitting a vast radiant light that illuminated all the heavens. The boundless *Wují* (無極) *Bàntán* (梵剎) realms and every domain trembled in response; the ten directions of the boundless *Wují* worlds all became as clear as crystal and glass, with no obstruction between them.

To the right, the *Chapter on Knowing the Time and Emitting Light* has been meticulously collated, with no errors found. Your humble subject, Liang, respectfully states:

The exalted and the humble, the distant and the near—each occupies its place, and though their stations differ, their essence and form vary accordingly. Without a unifying principle, how could their responses be the same?

In reverence, the Emperor of Jade governs the myriad heavens and commands all the earthly realms. Therefore, on this day, he specially emitted radiant light to illuminate all directions, causing all things to tremble, so that all sentient beings might awaken to awareness.

Seizing this wondrous opportunity, they are blessed by the Dao’s grace.

Yet the divine light’s profound meaning remains unknown to the world. I dare to reveal the hidden mysteries and universally bestow boundless wisdom.

For light is the very nature of the Dao. No living being, however dim, lacks it. Yet the Heavenly Sage, through cultivation and refinement, attains perfect unity with the utmost essence, while living beings, scattered and deluded, lose this precious treasure.

Thus, the Heavenly Sage’s complete essence shines with radiant clarity, while the lost treasure of living beings sinks into darkness. When the Heavenly Sage, possessing the Dao-nature of unified existence, deploys divine transformations to illuminate it, all beings who share this Dao-nature cannot fail to be startled into awakening.

Therefore, when the divine light is emitted, it fills the Dharma-realm, and all phenomena within the Dharma-realm tremble and awaken in response.

Through the harmony of essence with essence, such wondrous function unfolds. Seekers must pursue it thus.

I humbly pray that the Heavenly Lord of Supreme Virtue may inspect and approve.

Your humble subject, Liang, speaks with utmost care.

The ten-directional assemblies arrive together, riding the five-hued jade wheels, the lingyun jade palanquins, the six-hued dark dragons, and the ten-perfected feathered canopies. The qilin dances and the phoenix sings, their resonant calls echoing in harmonious melodies, while the spirit consorts scatter flowers and the golden boys waft incense. They chant hymns of praise and sacred verses, ascending through the air.

This is the *Chapter on the Ten-Directional Assemblies*, which has been carefully verified and compared, with no discrepancies found.

I respectfully state: Though in terms of **manifestation** the ten directions are distinct,
And though in form the myriad sages differ,
Yet since all things share the same essence,
How could the wise and holy be distinct?
How could the distant and near differ in observation?
What boundaries could separate the four cardinal directions?

When the Heavenly Sage expounds the scriptures and the Jade Emperor emits divine light,
The assemblies from the ten directions universally gather—
This is the natural order of things.

All living beings ought to recognize this truth.

I, Liang, speak with utmost care.

At that time, the **Brahma-heavens** and all golden immortals,
The great vehicle bodhisattvas and the four assemblies of eight divisions,
Received this radiant illumination,
And all ascended upon the **spirit-mist nine numinous** flying cloud-jade carriages,
Celebrating the four great gatherings of the sky,
As the three luminaries exhaled their fragrance,
And the eight winds converged in joyous flight,
Revolving around the Dao’s presence,
Showering upon the assemblies countless marvelous flowers,
Descending like clouds to cover the gathering ground.

This is the *Chapter on the Golden Immortals’ Universal Arrival*,
Which has also been cross-verified, with no discrepancies found.

I respectfully state: The Dao arises from a single teaching,
Yet some may diverge from it—these are **sects**;
Or some may differ—these are **branches**.
Seeking the sect from the branches,
Divergence merges into unity—
How could there be any distinction?

Now, in the mortal world, the Dao is taken as a divergent path,
Like red and black ink—
Yet the Dao and its teachings share the same origin,
With no fundamental differences at all.

Thus, when the Heavenly Sage expounds the scriptures and the Jade Emperor emits divine light,
The golden immortals all gain the opportunity to attend.

This is because the **sages’ true hearts** are unified,
And the Dao and its teachings share the same origin.

May the mortal world recognize this truth.

I, Liang, speak with utmost care.

At that time, the light illuminated all the heavens,
Descending to the **limitless world** of the lower realm—
The **same as the Mysterious Capital** of the Dao-realm.

All those in the mortal world,
Who were near the Nine Heavens,
Interconnected and bound by kinship,
Were now equally close.

At that time, in the lower realm’s limitless world,
Mountains, ridges, valleys, ravines, and streams
Were vast yet flat as the palm of a hand,
The six directions equally near,
The three realms not distant—
The **Celestial Treasures Platform** stood arrayed among mortals,
With jade and pearls scattered in splendor,
Brightly shining upon the clouded thoroughfares,
Seven-treasured railings and barriers
Marking the Dao-path,
Jade trees and immortal flowers,
Luminous pearls and precious gems,
Resplendent in the **elixir field**,
Moss and grasses covering the ground in softness.

At that time, in the lower realm,
All saw the heavens’ wonders—
The **Hooked Heaven’s** exquisite music,
Spinning in resonance with the light,
Naturally vibrating in harmony.
They also saw the **luan’s** calls and the phoenix’s songs,
The soaring winds responding to the rhythms,
The dragons playing and the qilin coiling,
Their dances ascending to the celestial heights.

The heavens’ precious flowers,
Scattered and fallen,
Filled the paths in abundance.

This is the *Chapter on the Light Illuminating the Lower Realm*.

I privately consider:
From the perspective of the heavens,
The mortal world is **this**,
While the heavens are **that**.

Now, in the original text,
It states that **this** mortal world
Is near the Nine Heavens—
This implies no distinction between them.

Moreover, the divine light’s illumination
Naturally unites the upper and lower realms,
Fusing them boundlessly.

Yet the original text’s phrasing,
“**This** mortal world...”
Forces an artificial separation,
Not the natural state.

Thus, I have altered **this** to **that** in the mortal world’s context.
I have also corrected **lower realm** to **that lower realm**.

As for the original text’s claim,
“**This** mortal world also sees the *luan’s* calls and the phoenix’s songs,”
The word **this** is also an artificial imposition,
And I have changed it to **all**.

I privately consider:
The scriptures are the **heavenly texts**,
Not of mortal origin.
Since the **Heavenly Truth** descended to the world,
It was orally transmitted to the lower realm’s sages.
Those sages of the lower realm,
Recalled and recorded the teachings of the immortals.

From the perspective of mortals,
The text frequently uses **this**,
And occasionally contains unsettling phrases—
This is no cause for surprise.

I now revise it,
To ensure the **grand harmony of meaning**.
Fearful that mortals may not understand,
I explain it in detail here.
Those who recite and uphold it,
Let them not harbor other doubts.

I respectfully state:
When a mirror illuminates objects,
All forms appear;
When ash covers objects,
All impurities grow faint.

How much more so when the **Supreme Emperor’s** unobstructed,
Equal, and divine light
Illuminates all things—
Should not all beings bow and rise in unison,
With no distinction between near and far?

**Abandon** the living and the sentient,
And they will embody the Jade Emperor’s light emission.
Fusing the self with all things,
Equating good and evil,
Despising obstacles,
The light of this heart,
When emitted,
Will surely align with the Supreme Emperor’s unobstructed and equal light.

To seek the **principle** in the **sages’ deeds**,
Is to reveal no falsehood.
All living beings ought to recognize this.

The subject humbly speaks: At that time, the common and the holy were astonished in unison, the hidden and the dark opened to radiance, the celestial and the human rejoiced and celebrated with leaping exultation. All laypersons and scholars attained ascension, gazing upward at the effulgent treasure platforms of the kalpas, and downward upon the violet clouds spreading far and wide.

In those worlds, all peoples—
From the white-haired and wrinkled to the young and the tender—
All transformed and attained enlightenment,
Their hair black as indigo, their faces ruddy as vermilion,
The weak and the frail restored to vigor,
Their forms resplendent and luminous,
Their suffering healed, all liberated in joyous ease.
The lands sang of harmony and great peace.

*(The "Chapter on Manifesting the Divine Powers")*

The subject secretly observes: After the light shone upon the lower realms,
The effects were immediately seen.
Yet in the present text, there are slight discrepancies,
Causing the meaning to fail in coherence.

I respectfully adjust the phrase "At that time" to precede "the common and the holy were astonished in unison."
And I move "The lands sang of harmony and great peace" beneath "liberated in joyous ease."

The remaining phrases—such as "the divine wind reaching afar"—
Are displays of the Dao’s mysterious transformations,
Visible even in the hidden depths,
Not merely in the human world.

Thus, I place them in the next chapter.

The subject humbly speaks: Though the hidden and the manifest differ,
Their principles remain unchanged.
When the Emperor’s virtue and benevolent decree descend upon the mortal realm,
The dead, those burdened with sins, the exiled, the newly restored,
Those elevated in rank, and those further honored—
All grow yet more noble.
This is the special grace of the Emperor’s virtue.

How much more so when the **Supreme Emperor’s** extraordinary divine light descends—
A grace beyond the common—
That scholars ascend as immortals,
The aged regain their youth,
The young grow strong,
The sick are healed—
This is the natural order of things.

All living beings should strive to uphold the **Sacred Truth**,
Diligently seek the Dao’s teachings,
And await the **Jade Emperor’s** profound benevolence.

The Dao does not fail those who seek it,
The sages have clear instructions—
Let them heed this with sincerity.
The subject humbly speaks.

At that very moment,
The divine wind reached afar,
The ten thousand breaths rose in vitality,
Heaven shook and earth split,
The withered bones revived,
The drowned corpses flew with their souls,
All returned to their original forms;
The **Yin Regions** of iron enclosure and eternal night,
The **Nine Abysses**—
Were instantly shattered.
The beings of the hells—
Transformed into celestial realms,
Their suffering in the three evil paths
All dissolved.

At that time, the guilty ones,
By this light’s power,
Were born into the ten directions’ great heavenly palaces.

*(The "Chapter on Reviving the Withered and the Drowned")*

The subject secretly thinks:
Though the Dao’s transformations affect all equally,
There is still a natural order of near and far, first and last.
Thus, the effects of the divine light first manifest in the bright human world,
Then extend to the hidden realms of all beings—
This is the natural sequence.

The old text’s accounts,
Though recorded, were somewhat disordered.
I now place the phrase "At that very moment" above "The divine wind reached afar,"
And follow "All returned to their original forms" with "The **Yin Regions** of iron enclosure and eternal night..."
So that the order of precedence remains unbroken,
And the meaning flows smoothly,
Lest the original sight be lost as witnessed on that day when the scripture was expounded.

I have also removed the phrase "born into the celestial realms" from the old text.

The subject humbly speaks:
Withered bones should decay,
Drowned corpses should dissolve,
And evil destinies should confine—
This is the ordinary course.
Yet the Emperor’s grace is extraordinary,
Beyond the reach of ordinary logic.
Living beings should not presume to have evil or transgression,
For there will come a day of pardon and rebirth into the heavens,
Yet some may harbor a hope of fortune.
If such hope arises,
They will instead fall into deeper darkness.

There are matters to be feared,
Thus I speak of them first.
Yet I must also clarify the meaning of "liberation from confinement, resurrection of the dead."

The descent into evil paths is not their natural state,
But arises from the accumulation of heavy sins and karmic deeds.
The retribution of the hells is severe,
And some cannot escape—
Yet with the reception of true grace,
They should naturally transcend transformation.
Especially when encountering the **Jade Emperor’s** radiant light,
A grace of extraordinary pardon—
Then sins and evils are entirely released,
As boiling water melts ice.

For the original spirit, a single soul,
Ascending with the sun’s light to the Nine Heavens—
This is no difficult matter.

As for the revival of withered bones and drowned corpses,
This must be explained through metaphor.
Fish scales and bones rot in the mud,
Yet with water, they revive again;
Pond lilies wither on the earth,
Yet with water, they sprout anew.
Water is but one thing,
And even fish scales and pond lilies respond thus—
How much more so to the **Supreme Emperor’s** extraordinary grace?

Moreover, corpses are the transformed bodies of humans,
And bones are the remnants of corpses.
Bones are from corpses,
Corpses are from humans,
Humans are born from the **yin-yang** breaths of heaven and earth—
This can manifest in bones.
How much more so for other things?

Bones are the refined essence of the **qi**.
Now, scholars who refine their essence
Turn it into the golden elixir of the **Dan**,
Preserving form and dwelling in the world,
Achieving longevity and divine immortality.
Those bones, being the refined essence,
Should naturally differ from common things.

Thus, all things decay when buried in the earth,
Yet human bones endure for long ages without transformation.
This is because they are the refined essence.

Therefore, the **Supreme Sage’s** compassion and mercy
Possess the art of **Great Yin** transformation.
Ah! Unable to save them in life,
Yet still reviving them in death—
How profound is this compassion and resolve!

Now, with the **Supreme Emperor’s** radiant light,
Granting escape from confinement and resurrection of the dead,
Even to the revival of withered bones—
How shall the **Supreme Sage’s** virtue of cherishing life be repaid?

If even the slightest offense remains,
The **Yin Regions** and iron enclosures—
How can they be avoided?
All living beings should know this.

The subject humbly speaks.

At that time, the Jade Emperor divided his body,
Permeating the ten directions of all great celestial palaces.
He commanded the celestial officials to spontaneously manifest,
With white jade as the capital,
Yellow gold as the gates,
And the Seven Treasures’ Dark Garden’s Great Radiant Hall,
Illuminated with a luminous seat,
With banners, flags, and canopies,
Exquisite treasures and rare flowers,
All arrayed throughout.

To the right: *The Chapter on Division and Manifestation*,
Already meticulously collated,
With no errors at all.
The subject humbly speaks:

The Dao’s essence is like the void—
The void contains all things,
How could it be confined to a single corner?

The moon appears in the void;
Wherever there is water, its reflection is without fail.
Thunder resounds in the sky;
Wherever it can be heard, its sound penetrates without obstruction.

The Jade Emperor’s wondrous Dao-body is like the void—
Omnipresent, nowhere absent.
How could it compare to thunder or the moon?
And how could it need division before manifesting throughout all heavens and earth?

Yet, the eyes of living beings
Turn only when they encounter forms.
Thus, the Jade Emperor revealed his divided forms,
So that all sentient beings might gaze upon them,
Cultivate their minds, and take refuge,
Listening attentively to the wondrous teachings.

Therefore, he pervaded all the heavens, manifesting one form in each,
And the celestial hosts all revered their reflections,
Then, according to each direction, he expounded the Dharma,
Universal and received by all beings.

Ah! To know the Jade Emperor’s Dao-body as one,
Yet not know its divisions,
Is to see it as bound and not unified;
To know the Jade Emperor’s Dao-body as divided,
Yet not know its oneness,
Is to recognize it as chaotic and without order.

This is neither one nor not one,
This is neither division nor not division—
Hidden and revealed, gathered and dispersed,
Mysterious and silent, yet subtly communicating.
This is the subtle meaning of the Jade Emperor’s division and manifestation.

All living beings should ponder this.
The subject humbly speaks.

At that time, the Jade Emperor, with his divided form, pervaded this realm, ascending to the White Jade Capital, within the Golden Gate’s Seven-Treasured Mystic Gardens, upon the Great Radiant Hall’s Radiant Seat, and universally expounded the Dao of pure liberation to all directions.

The *Chapter on the Division and Propagation of the Marvelous Dao* has been meticulously collated, with no errors remaining. The subject humbly speaks:

In this turbid age, sentient beings fail to awaken to the True Dao. Thus, the seven emotions and six desires run wild, unchecked, and myriad offenses accumulate without resolution—geohellish retribution cannot be evaded. Who would have thought the Celestial Sovereign’s mercy, spreading forgiveness and deliverance, grants them direct ascent to pure realms of boundless joy?

Yet how could they know that even those born from accumulated merit, once their merit is exhausted, still cannot escape rebirth? How much more so those who, by grace alone, attain heavenly birth—such birth is merely the extent of the grace received. If they remain ignorant of cultivation, how can they attain liberation?

The Jade Emperor’s saintly grace is boundless, yet He still desires their ultimate liberation. Thus, He proclaims the Dao of pure liberation, so that all celestial and human beings may attain the supreme fruit.

Ah! His benevolent radiance is vast and profound, His compassionate intent far-reaching. How can the celestial and human beings fail to strive and advance, to fulfill the Jade Emperor’s intent of guiding and delivering them?

Mortal beings should reflect on the Jade Emperor’s act of pardoning, rescuing, and delivering them from suffering, and diligently do good, lest they abandon themselves. Then, the descent of imperial grace shall not be as limited as this.

Although this chapter records the Jade Emperor teaching celestial and human beings the Dao of pure liberation, the subsequent chapters do not explicitly mention His teaching of pure liberation. Why is this?

It is because the Jade Emperor, surrounded by all the Jade Maidens as attendants, has their true forms naturally emit fragrant essence, subtly containing the meaning of pure liberation. Thus, all beings in the six paths, illuminated by this light, awaken and comprehend, and through wondrous sounds and proclamations, all are expressions of pure liberation.

This is the Jade Emperor’s unsaid speech.

The sages who compiled the scripture, silently recognizing this truth, merely recorded: *"The Jade Emperor universally expounds the Dao of pure liberation to all directions."*

Ah! Those who perceive the Emperor’s heart and see through the outer events—these sages who compiled the scripture, their profound and mysterious composition is beyond measure, truly inconceivable.

Let those who recite the scripture seek this meaning.

The subject humbly speaks:

At that time, the Jade Emperor was attended by countless celestial maidens—Great Saints of the Boundless Heavens, Marvelous Conduct Immortals, and Sacred Consorts—arrayed on either side. These maidens possessed extraordinary and solemn beauty, adorned with celestial treasures and rare jewels. *"Celestial treasures"* refers to celestial maidens; *"rare jewels"* refers to extraordinary treasures. The old text mistakenly rendered *"celestial treasures"* as *"celestial maidens."* Now corrected.

Their forms were resplendent, their voices clear and piercing, delightful to all who heard. Moreover, their bodies naturally emitted a subtle, marvelous fragrance of spontaneous liberation. This fragrance, pervading all heavens—*the old text read "able to pervade all heavens."* If the character *"able"* is added before *"pervade,"* it implies forced action. Now corrected to *"surrounding."*

It filled the most wondrous lands of bliss and all other fortunate places on earth. All beings in the six paths—*the old text read "able to make all beings in the six paths."* The six paths suffer naturally from the fragrance; it was not forced upon them. Now corrected by removing *"able to."*

Those who heard this fragrance were universally enlightened. These six paths include the paths of celestial beings, humans, asuras, hells, hungry ghosts, and animals. *The old text appended "from this point onward"* beneath *"animal path."* The maidens’ fragrance was heard by all six paths at that time; it was not limited to afterward. This was a mistake in oral transmission. Now removed.

If celestial beings in the celestial path heard this fragrance, the signs of decline would be permanently eradicated, and their heavenly merit would increase.

If humans in the human path—kings, ministers, and commoners—heard this fragrance, they would attain the joy of longevity in human and celestial realms, or their bodies would be liberated through *shell-discardance* or *corpse-resolution.*

If asuras in the asura path heard this fragrance, they would dwell peacefully in heavenly palaces, free from the suffering of battle.

If beings in the hellish path heard this fragrance, they would escape hellish torment and attain the bliss of pure lands.

If hungry ghosts in the hungry ghost path—*the old text read "all hungry ghost spirits."* The subject humbly suggests that while spirits may occasionally fall into the hungry ghost path, once fallen, they are ghosts. The addition of *"spirit"* seems to confuse with *"only spirit."* Now removed—heard this fragrance, they would be sated, free from hunger and thirst.

If animals in the animal path—*the old text read "all beings."* Earlier, the hellish path mentioned *"all beings,"* but here, the animal path requires distinction, so *"beings"* is changed to *"animals"*—heard this fragrance, they would escape animal suffering and attain the joy of wisdom.

The *Chapter on Liberation Through Fragrance* has been meticulously collated and corrected.

The subject humbly speaks:

There are truths that are common knowledge, known even to ordinary people, and truths that are unusual—even the wise may not comprehend them. The subject dares to present his humble views on the *Chapter on Liberation Through Fragrance* to the world:

The subject observes that when the Jade Emperor first emitted light from the Seven-Treasured Mystic Gardens, all beings in the lower realms, including those in hellish suffering, were already born into heaven by that light. Now, the scripture records that after the Jade Emperor’s divided form manifested, He was attended by great saints and maidens, and it further states that the maidens’ fragrance pervaded this realm, yet all beings in the six paths who heard it attained liberation.

The doubts of the worldly folk arise: *"If ordinary beings in suffering were already born into heaven by the Emperor’s light, why then does the scripture speak of the maidens’ fragrance?"*

Ah! Such questions are not the fault of the world.

For matters beyond the scope of common reason, there are doubts that cannot be avoided—what is strange in this?

The subject humbly elucidates this, to dispel the world’s confusion.

With reverence, he addresses the Heavenly Venerable:

Now, in this teaching of the scripture, the true intention is to reveal the gate of pure and unadulterated liberation.

The female form is of essence purely yin. Because it is purely yin, it is ever close to impurity. Because it is close to impurity, the female body rarely possesses the disposition of sweet fragrance.

Yet now, all the maidens are able to align with the Jade Emperor in wisdom, insight, and purity—equal in their pristine nature. Thus, though their bodies are purely yin and near impurity, a subtle and wondrous fragrance of natural liberation arises from them.

Compare it to worldly people dwelling in filth and corruption: if they could make their hearts, insights, and actions all abide in a land of purity, then the exquisite fragrance of liberation would likewise emanate from their persons.

This scripture is devoted entirely to the pure and singular liberation of truth, hence its conclusion focuses solely on the maidens’ fragrance to reveal its profound meaning.

Though it is called fragrance, its essence must be understood through theory—not by clinging to material form.

For ordinary people, if they have no transgressions or faults, if they know the Dao and awaken to truth, and if every word they speak and every deed they perform is praised and admired by all, then their bodies are like those of the maidens—neither foul nor unclean, bearing a subtle and wondrous fragrance of liberation, heard by the blessed abodes of the heavens.

The maidens are like the impure body, while the fragrance is like my words and deeds. The fragrance pervading the heavens’ blessed abodes is like my words and deeds being seen throughout the ten thousand li. The six paths hearing the fragrance and attaining liberation is like virtuous words and virtuous deeds being practiced in the world, benefiting all people and things.

This is the path of cultivation, its flavor savored by all living beings.

If one were to conjecture thus recklessly, the meaning would be obscured and the intent stifled.

The subject humbly hopes that the Most Exalted Sage will discern this, and that the world will believe it.

The subject speaks with utmost sincerity.

At that time, the assembled celestial beings and guilty multitudes, having already been reborn in this supreme celestial palace through the grace of compassionate light, spontaneously awakened and understood the karmic causes of sin and virtue. Together with their retinues, they performed celestial dances and presented themselves before the Emperor of Heaven.

These beings, each filled with sorrow, spoke aloud:
*"For countless kalpas—thousands upon thousands—we wandered without sight of the Three Lights, perpetually enshrouded in darkness within the Three Evil Paths, enduring endless suffering."*

By the Emperor’s compassionate grace, we were illuminated, rescued, and reborn in heaven. All our evil deeds have been utterly extinguished, our bonds severed, and we have attained rebirth.

We now prostrate before the Emperor and take our places at the Dao’s threshold.

After these celestial beings and guilty multitudes had spoken thus, they kowtowed and resumed their positions.

**Right: *The Chapter of Awakening Through Light’s Reception*, which has been carefully collated, contains no errors.**

The subject humbly states:
The multitudes of living beings are burdened with heavy obstructions, their karmic consciousness obscured by accumulated sins, plunging them into hell. Even if they repent then, what use is it?

Yet now, by sudden grace, we not only escape suffering but ascend directly to the celestial palace—a fortune encountered once in a hundred million kalpas! This joy, beyond all expectation, knows no bounds.

Though we have left suffering for bliss, it is still better to cultivate virtue in this world and ascend to the realm of joy directly. The living beings of this world should diligently sow good deeds, earnestly seek the True Dao, and not wait until they fall into hell to hope for heavenly mercy and seek liberation. Even if they attain it then, their bodies will have already endured countless sufferings—truly a cause for lamentation. The multitudes should reflect deeply upon this.

The subject speaks with utmost sincerity.

At that time, the Jade Emperor emitted a wondrous voice, addressing all the celestial saints of the ten directions:
*"Attend closely, you saints! These guilty ones, for eons past, though devoid of wisdom, committed the Ten Evils, their minds defiled by the Six Dusts, their threefold actions entangled. They acted at will, heedless of awakening, their hidden and manifest sins deepening daily. Abandoning the Dao and betraying Truth, they followed falsehood and rejected the right path. Every thought and impulse bound them further, so that after their lives ended, they fell into the Three Paths of woe, unable to escape.*

*Had they not encountered this Dharma feast today, how could they have freed themselves?"*

**Right: *The Chapter of the Wondrous Voice Opening Salvation*, which has been carefully collated, contains no errors.**

However, in the original text, *The Chapter of the Wondrous Voice* appears after the section where celestial beings are transferred and united. The subject observes that after the Jade Emperor’s manifestation in six forms—where the scent of liberation was heard, leading to awakening and the fulfillment of past karmic ties—he then emitted the wondrous voice to reinforce instruction before transferring and uniting the celestial beings with the Primordial Origin. The original sequence, where the Celestial Worthies descend and transmit the scriptures, is disordered.

The subject has thus rearranged and verified this, hoping to achieve coherence.

The subject humbly states:
The subject has heard in the scriptures: *"The spirit gives life, the heart takes it."* Thus, upon reflecting deeply on the profound meaning, one understands that the heart’s function brings both harm and benefit beyond measure.

At birth, humans are merely the abode of spirit, with no inherent heart. Only when the Four Great Elements coalesce does the spirit congeal into the heart, and as the heart houses the spirit, it becomes detached from its origin.

Once the heart is detached, it generates thoughts. A single thought, once rooted, gives rise to a hundred actions, and from a hundred actions, myriad sins and virtues sprout. Thus, when this thought aligns with goodness, merit is accomplished; when it aligns with evil, guilt is sealed. This is none other than the power of the single heart.

Now, observe the fall into the Six Realms: it was not due to external influences but arose from impure thoughts and actions, leading to karmic entanglements that plunged them into the Three Paths for endless ages, unable to transcend.

The Threefold Actions’ entanglements and the Six Dusts’ defilements stem not from anything outside the heart’s generation or the mind’s arising.

The Jade Emperor, in his boundless compassion, saves and guides all realms, fearing that though they may escape suffering through grace, their roots may not be steadfast enough for further cultivation. Thus, he emits the wondrous voice to clarify the nature of their former descent, so that all realms may recognize the Great Origin and no longer stray.

This is all from his merciful intent, vast and unwearied.

The common folk should heed the Emperor’s wondrous voice, uphold the precepts firmly, and avoid transgression. Only then can they ascend to heaven and attain fruition with ease. But if they grow negligent and disregard the precepts, they will sink into the sea of suffering—like trying to run on a tightrope while rolling a ball, with no return possible.

Do not presume that the Emperor’s grace is always attainable.

The subject speaks with utmost sincerity.

At that time, the Heavenly Ones transformed into the Emperor of the Dao, who immediately, through divine power, did not alter his own place but transported all the celestial beings and humans to the **Yusheng Palace** of the **Jingming Pure Realm**, the gathering beneath the **Yuan Shi** (Primordial Origin). These multitudes were unaware and did not know.

At that moment, the Heavenly Sovereign presided over the assembly, seeing the **Yushi** (Jade Emperors) of the Ten Directions—all transformed bodies—come together. Before the assembly, the Heavenly Sovereign appeared like a boundless mirror, reflecting all their forms, each interpenetrating the others.

Then the great assembly bowed in reverence and gazed upward.

Among the transformed bodies of the Jade Emperor, the **Saintly Central One** was the most majestic, fostering pure faith, strengthening resolve, and filling their hearts with joy, leaving no trace of retreat. His firm and unshakable spirit arose.

Now, the celestial beings and humans, who had recently ascended to heaven, suddenly beheld the Heavenly Sovereign’s sublime gathering and the Dao-field, pristine and unparalleled, adorned with the **virtue of non-action**. They leapt in delight, all offering homage at once, exclaiming that they had never before witnessed such splendor.

The above *"Chapter of Transplanting and Connecting Celestial Beings and Humans"* has been cross-referenced and verified; there are no discrepancies.

The subject respectfully declares:
The **nature of the Law (dharma)** is equal and boundless, neither increased by addition nor diminished by subtraction. It is not distant when approached nor remote when viewed from afar. The terms **Saint**, **True**, **Heaven**, and **Human** were never originally distinct.

Yet how is it that living beings, embodied and concrete, stray from their origin and source? Even a hair’s breadth of deviation leads to error a thousand miles wide.

Thus, high and low are suddenly divided, and the common and the Saintly are utterly distinct. Though they may perceive each other, they remain separated by a vast chasm.

Now the Jade Emperor, out of profound grace, **transplants** and **connects** those of suffering realms, elevating them all. Though the wondrous voice was emitted to clarify the roots of their offenses—both detailed and thorough—he still feared that the beings of all realms had not yet comprehended the subtleties of the **Law-nature**. Therefore, he manifested a different realm to demonstrate the **unobstructed reality of the Law-nature**.

Hence, without altering his own place, he transplanted and connected the celestial beings to the Yuan Shi gathering. From the perspective of the celestial beings, the Yuan Shi gathering lay far within the **ultimate exalted domain**. From the Yuan Shi gathering’s standpoint, the celestial realms appeared distant in the **most humble abode**.

Now, the Jade Emperor, unmoved in his own place, brings the celestial beings and the Yuan Shi realm within reach—like the finger and palm—clearly visible before their eyes.

Is this not the **mysterious operation of the Law-nature**, where heaven and humans share a single principle, and high and low are in perfect accord?

Aspiring scholars should study the *"Chapter of Transplanting and Connecting"* with deep reflection, savoring its profound mysteries. Then, within their own nature, the harmony of heaven and earth, and within their own hearts, the unity of the Saintly and the common, will merge and blend, boundless in their breadth.

This is not merely a comparison for those who seek to cultivate and verify the Dao below the immortals.

The Dao does not fail humanity; one should only redouble their diligence.

The subject, **Liang**, speaks with utmost sincerity.

At that time, the Ten Directions’ **transcendent sovereigns of all transformations** (化玉皇) and the **Celestial Lord** (天尊) all merged into one body. Rising from the **Law Assembly** (法席), they knelt facing north.

The **Celestial Lord** spoke: *"In the past, after departing from this world, there was a realm called Radiant and Pure Auspicious Joy (光严妙乐). Its king was named Pure Virtue (净德). The king had a queen named Precious Moonlight (宝月光). Yet the king had no heir. One day, I pondered thus: ‘Now that I am aging, and there is no crown prince, when my body perishes, who will inherit the ancestral temples and the state?’

Having formed this thought, I immediately issued decrees to all **Daoist assemblies** (道众) across the palaces, ordering them to follow the established **rites and teachings** (科教), to hoist the **auspicious banners and canopies** (旛盖), to maintain purity and solemnity, to array offerings in abundance, and to perform **six-period Daoist rites** (六时行道), praying earnestly to the **True and Holy Saints** (真圣). After half a year, without wavering in my initial resolve, suddenly in the night, Queen Precious Moonlight dreamed of the **Supreme Dao Lord** (太上道君) and the **Assemblies of the Most Perfect** (诸至真), whose forms were golden and jade-like, a pair of pure and radiant beings. They rode a **five-colored dragon chariot** (五色龙舆), surrounded by **glowing banners and luminous flags** (耀景旌), sheltered beneath **resplendent cloud canopies** (明霞盖). At that moment, the **Supreme Dao Lord** sat serenely in the chariot, cradling an infant whose body emitted a hundred billion rays of light from every pore, illuminating all the palaces in a myriad of **treasure hues** (百宝色). The **standards and banners** (幢节) led the way, floating through the air.

The queen’s heart filled with joy, and she reverently received the infant, kneeling in homage before the **Supreme Dao Lord** and saying: ‘The king has no heir. I humbly beg You to grant this child as the sovereign of our realm. May You, in Your boundless compassion, pity and permit my wish.’

The **Supreme Dao Lord** replied to the queen: ‘I shall specially bestow him upon you.’

The queen then bowed in gratitude to the **Supreme Dao Lord** and took the child. Upon awakening from the dream, she conceived. After a year of gestation, in the **Year of the Dragon-Horse (丙午)**, on the **ninth day of the first month at noon**, she gave birth to the prince in the royal palace.

At the time of his birth, his body blazed with **treasure-like light** (宝光焰), filling the entire kingdom. His appearance was wondrous and exquisite; all who beheld him were captivated.

As a youth, he was **quick-witted and insightful**; as he grew, he became **compassionate and benevolent**. Within his realm, he took all stored treasures and every kind of wealth and distributed them to the **impoverished and suffering**, the **widowed, orphaned, and solitary**, those **without refuge**, and all **starving, diseased, and crippled beings**. His **mercy and harmony** (仁爱和逊) were boundless, and the songs of the people praised him. His influence extended to distant lands; all under heaven revered and followed him. The prince was called **Return-to-Ren** (归仁太子), and his father rejoiced.

After this, the king suddenly passed away, and the prince ascended the throne. Bowing to the fleeting nature of life, he proclaimed to his ministers: ‘The succession must follow the **Dao**.’

Thus, he abandoned his kingdom and retreated to **Universal Clarity Auspicious Joy Mountain** (普明香严山) to cultivate the **Dao**. His practice reached fruition, and he transcended.

Following this, he passed through **eight hundred kalpas** (劫), always relinquishing his kingdom for the sake of all beings, **severing his attachments** to pursue **Daoist cultivation** (学道). Afterward, for another **eight hundred kalpas**, he practiced **medicinal arts** (行药), healing the sick and rescuing beings, making them **secure and content**.

When that kalpa ended, he again traversed **eight hundred kalpas**, employing **skillful means** (方便), opening the **Daoist treasure repositories** (道藏), expounding **sacred scriptures** (灵章), and **proclaiming the true transformation** (正化). He **extolled the divine powers** (神功), aiding realms and saving people—from the **hidden to the manifest**.

After this, for another **eight hundred kalpas**, he **endured suffering and humiliation** (忍辱), **sacrificing his own flesh and blood** (舍己血肉) for the sake of his practice.

Thus, he cultivated for **three thousand two hundred kalpas** before attaining the **Golden Immortal** (金仙) stage, named **Pure and Natural Awakening Sovereign Thus-Come** (清净自然觉王如来). He taught all **bodhisattvas** (菩萨) the **sudden insight into the Great Vehicle’s true essence** (顿悟大乘正宗) and guided them into the **progressive path of the Mysterious Dao of Emptiness** (渐入虚无妙道).

Having cultivated further for **a hundred million kalpas**, he finally attained the **Celestial Sovereign** (玉帝) stage.

Having spoken thus, the **Law Assembly’s pure congregation** (法筵清众) in unison exclaimed: *"Such a marvel has never been heard before!"*

This is the **"Chapter of the Transformation and Birth"** (化生本行章), which has now been cross-verified and contains no errors.

I, your subject **Liang**, humbly state: *"The **Supreme Cause and Effect** (无上大因缘) and **Supreme Virtue** (大功德), since the beginningless past, have never been as vast as the Celestial Sovereign’s transformation and birth.*

The **Celestial Lord** (天尊) established this **subtle Daoist site** (微妙道场) to **display the Three Realms** (三界), desiring to **proclaim the great cause and virtue**. Therefore, He first caused the **Celestial Sovereign** (玉帝) to manifest light, **revealing the grand transformation** (大神化), before **expounding the secrets** (秘密) and **detailed the origins of the Transformation and Birth** (化生本行).

Thus, after the **Celestial Sovereign** demonstrated the **transplanting and connecting of heaven and humans** (移接天人), He **divided and merged** (自分而合), **returned to the origin and restored the root** (返本还元), **manifesting the Supreme Dao Body** (无上道身). When paying homage to the **Primordial Sovereign** (元始), during the audience, He never once spoke a word to the **Celestial Lord** (天尊).

The **Celestial Lord** and the **Celestial Sovereign** (玉帝) share a **single luminous mind** (心光), **neither one nor two**. Hence, the **Celestial Sovereign** faced north and knelt in homage, and the **Golden Mouth’s wondrous speech** (金口妙言) directly proclaimed the **Transformation and Birth**.

Observing this today, when the **Celestial Sovereign’s body** (帝身) **divides to manifest all the heavens** (分现诸天), it is the **True One’s universal transformation** (真一应化). When these **divided manifestations** (分现诸身) **merge into unity** (合为一体), it is the **True One’s immovable essence** (真一不动).

The **Celestial Lord’s** establishment of this **subtle Daoist site** is to **proclaim the great cause and virtue**. The **Golden Mouth’s proclamation** of the **Transformation and Birth** is to **let all beings of the Three Realms know the vastness of the Celestial Sovereign’s cause and virtue**, so they may emulate and cultivate accordingly.

The **True One’s Non-dual Path** (真一不二法门) is this; the **Pure and Liberated Dao** (清净解脱之道) is also this.

All beings should **contemplate the Celestial Sovereign’s Transformation and Birth**, and **strive to build the Supreme Mysterious Merit** (无上之玄功), so that their **virtue may be towering and vast** (功德巍巍).

Again, observe how the **Celestial Sovereign** **divides from unity** (自一而分) and **merges back into unity** (自分而一). Thus, one may **enter the True Non-dual Path** (造真一不二之门) and **attain the Supreme Dao** (成无上道).

If one **endures no hardship**, from **a single moment** (自一时) to **the four seasons** (以至於四时), from **a single year** (自一年以至於百年) to **a hundred years**, from **a single lifetime** (自一生) to **many lifetimes**, from **a single kalpa** (自一劫) to **a hundred million kalpas**, with **unyielding diligence**, then even the **coarse and impure body** (凡身浊质) may **shed defilement and become true** (离垢成真). The **Great Maitreya Heaven** (大弥罗天) will **prepare the way for your ascent** (铺张分位), allowing you to **attain realization** (登证).

With the **Three Realms’ attendants** (列侍三境) serving and approaching the **Celestial Sovereign**, what further difficulty could there be?

All beings and those who cultivate should **ponder this deeply**. I, your subject **Liang**, humbly state.

At that time, a **jewel maiden** (玉女) from the assembly named **Moonlight** (夜光) arose from her seat, **adjusting her attire** (严整衣冠) and **composing her steps** (从容雅步). Kneeling before the **Celestial Lord**, she said: *"I, your subject, have been fortunate in the past to serve You in person, offering reverent and sincere homage. This has spanned a hundred million kalpas."*

The **Three Pure Ones’ realm**—golden palaces, jade capitals—where stillness and serenity reign, unbounded freedom and joyous ease prevail. Within the sacred domain, they dine on the sounds of **dharma**, yet never before have they witnessed such a rare and wondrous sight.

I do not know how, within the luminous **Dao**, the **Ten Directions’ celestial beings** manifest their sacred forms, all bearing the **Celestial Sovereign’s transformed **dharma-body**□. The **Heavenly Pure Ones**, **Mystic Conduct Immortals**, and **Spiritual Consorts** attend as guardians. These **jewel maidens**, their features noble and refined, their forms exquisitely wondrous, surpass all comparison.

Further, by the **Celestial Sovereign’s divine power**, they are now all gathered in the **Pure Vacuity Heaven**. I do not know by what cause and condition this **jewel maiden** has attained such a supreme **color-body**?

Reflecting on the **Celestial Lord’s** boundless compassion, He enlightens me to my unenlightened state. Then the **Celestial Lord** spoke to the **Moonlight Jewel Maiden**, saying:

*"You have only recently entered the sacred **Dao-flow**. Though wise, you do not yet comprehend fully. These **jewel maidens**—from countless kalpas past, they cultivated **mystic conduct**, mastered the **gates of liberation**, shared **pure faith**, **pure understanding**, **pure mindfulness**, **pure conduct**, **pure body**, **pure heart**, **pure intention**, **pure fruit**, and **pure retribution**. They possessed **great compassion** and **great pity**, sheltering all beings as a mother cherishes her child, loving them as her own. They upheld the precepts with singular devotion, their minds immersed in the **Great Dao**, observing strict **vegetarian abstinence** and taking grand vows. For countless kalpas, they reverently served the **Jade Emperor**.

These **jewel maidens** are not truly women—they are **Heaven’s utmost purity**, manifesting as **jewel maidens** to rescue sentient beings. Thus, their **bodies, colors, divine powers, and wisdom**—whether hidden or revealed—are in harmony with the **Celestial Sovereign’s**.

When **Moonlight** heard this, her heart opened in enlightenment. She bowed in joy and returned to her seat in silence.

**Right, the *Chapter of the Jewel Maiden’s Mystic Conduct***, having been cross-verified, contains no errors. Your subject humbly states:

It is said, *"Man does not know his body is sacred; a horse does not know his body is a dragon."* Truly, these words are profound.

The **jewel maiden’s** body is of **pure yin** essence. **Pure yin** is close to impurity, and thus it is fitting that her path to **purity** is arduous. Yet now, through cultivating **mystic conduct**, she has mastered the **gates of liberation**. By *"mastered"* is meant **liberation from all bonds**.

But tracing the root of her attainment—it began with cultivating **mystic conduct**, and **mystic conduct** itself stems from **great compassion and great pity**, along with her **faith, understanding, mindfulness, conduct, body, heart, and intention**—all purified. Thus, her **fruit and retribution** are without exception pure, leading to **complete liberation**.

Ah! A **jewel maiden** of **yin’s impure** nature, yet able to cultivate **compassion and purity**, to practice **mystic conduct**, and attain **liberation**, serving the **Jade Emperor**—and further, her **body, colors, divine powers, and wisdom** hidden or revealed, all in harmony with the **Celestial Sovereign’s**—even to the point where beings of the **Six Realms**, upon smelling her **body-scent**, also attain liberation! How vast and boundless are the **merits and retributions** of **mystic conduct**!

All beings in this world, endowed with **original qi** from the **Primordial Beginning**, were never inherently different from these **jewel maidens**. If one cultivates **mystic conduct** to match theirs, how could their future **realization** differ?

All living beings should strive earnestly, emulating this path. As for the earlier chapter where the **Jade Emperor** expounded the **Dao of pure liberation** to the **Ten Directions**, this is precisely it. The **Jade Emperor’s** unsaid words should also be pondered.

Your subject **Liang** humbly states:

At that time, the **High Void, Pure Clarity Heavenly Sovereign**, with celestial attendants, rode the **Eight Auspicious Celestial Chariot**, sheltered beneath the **Nine-Light Jewel Umbrella**, playing **mysterious songs** and **wondrous music**, reciting **infinite sacred verses**, scattering **heavenly treasure flowers** and **Heaven’s True Fragrance**. They flew through the air, arriving before the **Dao**.

By the **Celestial Sovereign’s** mighty **威神** (awe-inspiring spirit-power), these **treasure flowers** transformed in midair into a **jewel umbrella**, sheltering all beneath its vast canopy without omission.

Seeing this rare spectacle, the **High Void, Pure Clarity Heavenly Sovereign** bowed deeply and knelt, reporting to the **Celestial Sovereign**:

*"Your humble subject was negligent in attending the **dharma-assembly** at our last meeting. Today’s auspicious celebration has raised this **dharma-bridge**, benefiting both **mortal and immortal**, **common and sacred**, all bathing in the **Celestial Grace**. The radiant light shines forth, manifesting a **rare form**, illuminating the **Ten Directions**, the **Four Heavenly Kings**, the **Six Desires**, and all **lands of bliss**. The **true and sacred assemblies** witnessing this light all gather in response. Below, it illuminates the **Ten Directions’ boundless worlds**, aligning with the **Mysterious Capital**, approaching the **Nine Heavens**, where **spirit winds** play music, harmonizing **pitch and tone**, resounding through the **cloud courts**, all forming **sacred verses**.

All beings attain **Dao-transformation**. Even the **Yin Valley Iron Enclosure**, the **Eternal Night Nine Abysses**, and all tormented beings in the **Six Realms of Hell**—all receive the light’s power and are reborn in the heavens, experiencing joy.

Your subject’s scattered **heavenly treasure flowers** swiftly coalesce into this umbrella, covering all beneath its **awe-inspiring spirit-power**. Your subjects’ **thousand-kalpa merits** have now ripened, the **Nine Heavens’ destiny fulfilled**, the **Royal Dao** vast and unobstructed, the **True Teaching** flourishing. Today’s great auspiciousness is universally acknowledged for its **mysterious virtues**.

At that time, the **High Void, Pure Clarity Heavenly Sovereign** praised the **Celestial Sovereign** with this **gāthā**:

*"Golden **jiao-gate**, the **Primordial Ancestor** of the **Heavenly Vault**,
The **Exalted Jade Emperor**, most honored.
His **mystic form** surpasses all heavens,
His **compassionate light** illuminates the **Three Realms**.
The **True and Sacred** **Dao-Master** of **mystic vision**,
Heaven and man alike rely on him as their guide.
With **Great Vehicle teachings**, he points out the lost,
The **One True Principle** revealed to all.
His **merits and virtues** are boundless as the void,
Praise for him is endless and inexhaustible.
This **Heavenly Sovereign** of the **Vault’s expanse**—
His **mystic vision** and **mystic knowledge** are unmatched,
Without equal or peer, serene and pure,
Fathomless in presence, yet ever-present,
The **Supreme Sage**, the **Supreme Spirit**,
Possessing **great divine power**, the **Light-Treasury**,
A **Great Man** who opens the **Dao** for **heaven and earth**,
His teachings endless, his **great compassion** and **great pity** flowing,
He turns the **dharma-wheel**, rescuing all beings—
Thus is he named the **Jade Emperor."*

「The **Vault’s True Elder**,
In **wondrous perfection**, pure and clear,
With **wisdom and eloquence** unparalleled,
The **Supreme Dao/Way**, the **Supreme Sovereign**,
He opens and liberates all beings—
Thus he performs this **light** of **manifestation**.

Here ends the *Ode of Praise to the Heavenly Sovereign*, which has been cross-verified and contains no discrepancies.
The humble servant respectfully states:
The **Jade Emperor’s** merits and virtues are vast—
Words cannot fully praise them,
Nor analogies exhaust their grandeur.
Even if all beings in the **sandhi-world**,
With countless tongues, extol and beautify him,
They could never exhaust his praise—
How much more so with one mortal tongue!

Now, the **High Void’s** clear and luminous Heavenly Sovereign is extolled in this **gatha**,
For fear that beings in the **Three Realms** might yet remain unaware of the Emperor’s **merits and virtues**.
Though skilled artisans could imitate the true forms of **Yin and Yang**,
And depict the divine radiance of sun and moon,
Even the finest craftsman could not fully employ his artistry—
How much more impossible to exhaust the Emperor’s **virtue/power**, lofty and boundless in scope?

Though this **gatha** is beautiful and profound,
It still falls short of capturing even a fraction of the Emperor’s **virtue/power**,
Yet the Heavenly Sovereign’s intent is to use this as a pretext
To inspire the **endless teachings** of the **Golden Mouth**.

Thus, the **gatha** of praise and extolment
Does not hesitate to repeat itself in detail.
The **Heavenly Sovereign** perceives their sincerity,
And so, in the following chapter, continues with **sacred instruction**:

*"Thus the humble servant speaks with reverence.
At that time, the **High Void’s** clear and luminous Heavenly Sovereign,
Having delivered the **gatha** of praise and extolment,
Turned to the **Four Assemblies** and declared:
This Emperor’s **body** is the **Dao-body**,
Not an ordinary form.
This is the **body of boundless merit**,
The **body of pure, natural clarity**,
The **immutable, unshakable, supreme, true, and empty Law-body** of divine intelligence.
His **mystic aura** and **mystic presence** are vast and unconfined,
His **name** resounds throughout the **Ten Directions**,
No darkness remains unilluminated,
His **divine marvels** are resplendent and awe-inspiring—
Beyond all measure or description.

This Emperor’s **body** is not the result of **conditional merit**,
Nor does it arise from cultivation through **deliberate action**.
Though in past **kalpas** he descended to the mortal realm,
He demonstrated the **Great Divine Power** while maintaining his **pure body**,
Never ceasing to **manifest in the Jade Vault**,
To **multiply his forms** and **adapt to all regions**,
To benefit all beings, elevate them beyond the **worldly shore**,
And universally propagate the **teachings of the Dao/Way**,
Enlightening future generations,
Guiding them in **faithful practice**,
And helping them attain **True Reality** and the **Dao/Way**.
Through these **merits and virtues** of **ornamentation**,
His **light** perpetually fills the heavens,
His **divine intelligence** penetrates all mysteries—
Beyond all calculation or comprehension.

This **body’s light** possesses **wondrous names**,
Such as the **Light of Great Divine Power**,
The **Light of Great Compassion and Great Pity**,
The **Light of Great Joy and Renunciation**,
The **Light of Great Endurance and Great Forbearance**,
The **Light of Great Equanimity**,
The **Light of Great Gentleness and Harmony**,
The **Light of Great Freedom and Great Sovereignty**,
The **Light of Great Benefit**,
The **Light of Great Fulfillment**,
The **Light of Great Wisdom**,
The **Light of Great Auspiciousness**,
The **Light of Great Liberation**,
The **Light of Great Refuge**,
The **Light of Great Merit**,
The **Light of Great Perfection**,
The **Light of Great Unobstructedness**—
A **light** none can surpass.

Thus, you who wish to behold this Emperor
Cannot do so—
For you still cling to **impure actions** of **body, speech, and mind**,
To **afflictions** and **worldly deeds**,
Which obstruct your vision,
Preventing you from seeing the Emperor’s **compassionate face**.

Now, for you who gather here,
I proclaim the **Law of Clearing Obstacles**—
You must all diligently follow it.
At that moment, the **Four Assemblies** rejoiced beyond measure,
Each prostrated before the **Supreme Sovereign’s** seat,
Bowed in homage,
And eagerly wished to hear more.

The **Heavenly Sovereign** spoke:
*"The **Law of Clearing Obstacles** requires
The generation of **Great Compassion**,
No **doubt or confusion**,
No **greed or anger**,
No **lustful desire**,
No **jealousy or envy**,
No **harm or malice**,
No **worldly attachments**,
No **worldly thoughts**,
No **greed or envy**,
No **infatuation with sounds and colors**,
No **clinging to right or wrong**,
No **hatred or love**,
No **discrimination**,
No **arrogance**,
No **fixation**—
Concentrate your **mind**, purify your **thoughts**,
Subdue all **spirits** within,
Your **heart** as boundless as the **Great Void**,
Inner and outer **purity** untainted,
Accepting all without exclusion,
Receiving all without reservation—
Never allowing external **evil forces** to disrupt your **Supreme Dao/Way**,
To drag you away from **True Reality**,
To destroy your **divine essence**,
To steal your **supreme treasures**,
Or to condemn you to **endless kalpas** of **worldly existence**,
To sink into the **netherworld’s snares**,
Where **myriad demons** assail you,
And for **hundreds of thousands of kalpas**
You hear no **mystic teachings**,
Suffer **torment by ghosts and spirits**,
And wander from life to death.

Thus, you must all **resolve in mind**,
To **protect the True Dao/Way** faithfully,
Never letting it slip away.

As previously stated,
All these **obstacles** must be **severed and abandoned** by you—
Your **body** will then attain **purity**,
And you will transcend all **difficulties**.
This is called the **Dao-Treasure**,
The **supporting pillar of the Law**.

Furthermore, you must **cultivate and uphold** this **sacred text**,
As if standing before the Emperor himself—
With **reverence and admiration**,
With **devotion to his form**,
With **praise of his name**—
Only then will you behold his **compassionate face**,
All be **protected and guided**,
Universally hear the **mystic teachings**,
And **personally offer reverence and sustenance**,
Never again falling into **worldly cycles**.

At that time, the **Four Assemblies** heard these words and rejoiced,
Exclaiming praise never before encountered.
Here ends the *Chapter of the Sovereign’s Teachings and Severing Obstacles*,
Which has been cross-verified and contains no discrepancies.

The humble servant respectfully states:
A **sutra** is a **path**,
A **method of cultivation**.
When mortals uphold a **sutra**, there are two **gates of practice**:
One is **recitation with the mouth**,
One is **holding in the mind**.

**Recitation with the mouth** refers to **verbal praise**;
**Holding in the mind** refers to **faithful practice through intention**.
**Recitation with the mouth** should take **holding in the mind** as its foundation,
And **holding in the mind** should take **recitation with the mouth** as its priority—
The two **mutually support** each other,
And **merits and virtues** are thus fulfilled.
To **neglect one in favor of the other** is to fail in **merits and virtues**.
Thus, the **sutra** combines both **recitation and holding**.

To **recite without holding** is to **utter empty words**,
While the **mind** remains unbenefited;
To **hold without reciting** is for the **mind** to stir,
Yet the **intent** remains unexpressed.
Both must be **pursued together** for the task to be completed.
This is the **doctrine of recitation and holding**.

As for **reciting and holding** the **Jade Emperor’s sutra**,
You must **follow and emulate** the Emperor’s **merits and virtues**,
And **mirror his cultivation and realization**—
Only then is it possible.

To **follow and emulate** involves five **gates of practice**:
1. **Reverence and admiration**,
2. **Confession and severance of obstructing deeds**,
3. **Accumulation of merit for mutual benefit**,
4. **Tolerance and divine insight**,
5. **True Unity and Transformation**.」

「The so-called **Reverence and Admiration** refers to what the **sutra** says: **dwelling on** the **reverent form** of the Emperor, crafting the Emperor’s **image**, praising his **name**, and reciting and pondering the **teachings** of the **sutra**.

The so-called **Confession and Severance of Obstructing Deeds** refers to what the **sutra** says: the **methods of severing obstructions** are fully recorded in various **teachings**.

**Accumulation of Merit for Mutual Benefit** refers to what the **sutra** says: **manifesting transformations** of the **body**, benefiting the **world**, and propagating the **teachings** of the **Dao**.

**Tolerance and Divine Insight** refers to what the **sutra** says: the **mind** as vast as the **Great Emptiness**, containing all without exclusion, embracing all without reservation—**compassionate means** and **perfect understanding** are its essence.

**True Unity and Transformation** refers to what the **sutra** says: the **body** remains **pure and undefiled**, ever present in the **Golden Gates of the Celestial Palace**, appearing in accordance with the **direction** as needed.

Those who practice according to these five **gates** with diligence shall attain the **position of the Great Pīlū (Pīlū) Heavenly Immortal Deities**.

After three years of practice, all **deities** shall hold them in **respect and awe**, and **demons** shall be subdued in **form**.
After ten years of practice, all **ten directions** shall serve them, and their **spirit** shall ascend to **Jade Purity**.
After two **periods of time** (i.e., twenty years), their **virtue and power** shall be complete, and their **body** shall soar to **Jade Purity**, whereupon they shall attain the **Three Bodies**.

The **Three Bodies** are those described in the **sutra**: the **body of boundless virtue**, the **pure and natural body**, and the **unshakable, supreme Law Body of True Void**, where **divine wisdom** abides.

Aspiring **cultivators** and those who **recite the sutra** should **contemplate and act** upon these words.

If one **recites this sutra with the mouth** yet **violates the precepts** with the **body**, the **sutra**’s **wondrous sounds** and **methods of severing obstructions** shall be in vain—then the *Chapter of Divine Retribution and Verification* fully records their **fate**.

Aspiring **cultivators** and **reciters** should **revere and fear** accordingly.

Thus concludes the **Highest Jade Emperor’s Original Practice and Compilation of the Sutras**, Volume One.

**Chapter Two: The Supreme Great Radiant Perfection Divine Spell of the Great Light**

At that time, the **Primordial Ancestors Five Elders Supreme Emperor** bowed and knelt in reverence, and the **Celestial Sovereign** spoke: *"I have humbly heard that the Most High Jade Sovereign [original: Celestial Sovereign Most High Jade Sovereign] proclaims: 'The affairs of radiant light are uniquely attributed to the Jade Sovereign; now I omit the words 'Celestial Sovereign.' Out of benevolent thought for the common folk, I universally radiate divine light, illuminating the **dharma-realm**, bestowing the **Dao’s shade** upon the six **ordinary beings** and four **sages**. I consider that the ordinary folk have but a fleeting lifespan, the kalpa is nearing its end, the true path must be followed to save the countless people, so that those who cultivate the **True Way** may have hope of rising lightly, and the common folk of this latter age may all attain longevity and prosperity.*

Since antiquity, the ***Primordial Origin Cavern Mystery Divine Treasure Scarlet Scripture Jade Edition True Text*** emerged before the **Primordial Origin**, within the **void**, when heaven and earth had no roots, the sun and moon no light—dim and murky, without ancestor or lineage, without **qi** or form, without color or name, without shape or trace, without sound or voice—utterly chaotic, its **divine script** obscure, sometimes existing, sometimes vanishing. The **Two Principles** awaited it to divide, the **Great Sun** awaited it to illuminate; the **divine diagram** transformed the cosmic order, the **mysterious symbols** shifted with fate. Seizing the **Dao’s opportunity** and responding to the cosmic flow, it thus came into being. The **Jade Emperor** bestowed upon me the **Divine Treasure Secret Seal** and the **Unthinkable Divine Spell**, so that heaven and earth obtained it and were divided, the **Three Lights** obtained it and radiated brilliance. The **divine script** flourished luxuriantly, its mystery reflected in the **Upper Purity**, emanating from the **Primordial Azure Sky**, yet its hue was undetermined, its branches curving and twisting, beyond tracing or scrutiny.

The **Primordial Origin** refined it in the **Cavern Yang** hall and forged it in the **Flowing Fire** court, polishing its true form and radiating its luminous glow—**Cavern Yang’s essence** was crimson, hence its name, the *Scarlet Scripture*. When the **divine diagram** blazed forth, the **Ten Thousand Emperors** paid homage to the **True One**, flying through the void and walking on empty air, circling the **Upper Palace**, burning incense and scattering flowers, chanting the **Divine Verses** with their mouths. At that time, heaven sent down **Twelve Mysterious Auspices**, earth emitted **Twenty-Four Responses**, the **Upper Palace** celebrated the **Nine Heavens’ Cavern Depths**, and praised the **Three Heavens’ Precious Clarity**. The **divine wind** having stirred, the **Imperial Dao** was universally spread.

The **Primordial Origin** ascended to decree, the **Great True One** pressed the brush, the **Jade Consort** swept the mat, casting **golden tablets** and carving the *Scarlet Scripture Jade Edition*. The **Five Elders** held the **sacred talisman**, concealing it in the **Nine Heavens’ Cavern Depths**. The **Jade Maiden** attended to the incense, **Great Hua** held the cloth, the **Jade Boys** served as guards, and the **Jade Platform** faced the **Upper Courtyard**, where the **Nine Heavens’ Sacred Edict** was inscribed—unheard by ghosts or gods. Thus, heaven treasured it to bring about **floating prosperity**, earth concealed it to bring about **tranquility**, the **Five Emperors** wielded it to achieve **stabilization**, the **Three Lights** rode upon it to attain **high clarity**, the **Upper Sages** revered it to reach **divinity**, the **High Exalted** held it to attain **True Perfection**, the **Five Sacred Peaks** followed it to gain **spiritual resonance**, the **Son of Heaven** obtained it to bring about **governance**, and the **national lineage** enjoyed it for **great peace**.

It is indeed the **mysterious virtue** of the **divine script**, the **primordial root** of heaven and earth. Its **might and spirit** are vast and boundless, its **great transformation** sweeping and eternal, serving as the **foundation of the divine**. Its measure is unfathomable, towering in the **Great Void**. Its **true clarity** is fixed; now it is time to put it into practice.

At that time, the **Primordial Origin** transformed the cosmic order, the **mysterious symbols** opened the diagram, the **divine script** flourished luxuriantly, the **spiritual essence** spread across the **Five Directions**, dividing heaven and earth, enlightening all beings. This is the **great foundation’s work**; can it be briefly revealed in the **Divine Treasure Repository**?

Now, the **Imperial Dao** is universally spread, its blessings reaching the **Ten Directions**. Gazing upward at the **kalpa’s end**, the **true wind** must be followed. My sincere wish is to spread the **Dao’s shade** to the **eight far reaches**, let the **true wind** scatter across the **orchid groves**, so that even withering branches may aspire to the **Primordial Yang’s abundance**, and decayed bones may receive the **Cavern Depths’ sacred blessings**.

I humbly address the **Primordial Benevolence**, extending my **sincere supplication** below. Only by your pity and compassion may I hope to obtain the **Divine Treasure True Text’s transmission**, and teach those who have not yet heard?

Thus, the **Primordial Origin Celestial Sovereign** patted the table and raised his voice, concentrating his **True Essence** in deep contemplation. Observing that the time had arrived, he declared to all the **True Saints** of the **cosmic assembly**: *"The principles of yin and yang are now determined, the **kalpa’s numbers** are calculated, the **River Source’s movements** are observed, the **heavenly degrees** are recorded, the **seed-people** are selected, and the **Great Void** is pointed out. The **Nine Mysteries** resound, and yet the **Three Millennia** remain unopened to common speech—it is as though a barrier obstructs the path to the **True**. At that time, the **Five Elders Supreme Emperor** repeatedly questioned, and after a long while, the **Primordial Origin Celestial Sovereign** lowered his gaze and sighed deeply: 'Alas! How profound it is! The matters you now inquire—are they not distant?

This is the **Primordial Origin’s Divine Treasure**, the **true text of void and naturalness**. It gives rise to heaven and earth, enlightens the **divine**, stabilizes the **Five Sacred Peaks**, and brings peace to the people. The **Divine Treasure** is profoundly mysterious, the **Most Exalted** of all things. Heaven sends forth **mysterious auspices**, and the **spiritual** responds naturally.

Now, the **Three Heavens** are in **harmonious motion**, the **Six Heavens** follow the **Dao’s course**, and the **heterodox teachings** are opening their transformations. There will be **thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao** to choose from for those who seek the **True Way**. When this **Dao’s course** concludes, after the **Three Dragons**, in the year **Gengzi**, all **impure qi** will dissipate, and the **heavens will celebrate in assembly**. Then my **True Dao** will be followed.

For now, you may entrust it to me, and it shall be recorded in the **Upper Palace**. It has not yet been revealed in the **lower world**. The **mysterious teachings** have restrictions; they cannot be casually transmitted."*

You may proceed to the **Spiritual Capital of Purple Micro** in the **Upper Palace**, there to listen to the **Heavenly Resonance** at the **Golden Gate**, and receive the **Divine Decree** from the **Celestial Sovereign**.

Then you shall be instructed in the **Celestial Scriptures** to oversee the **Primordial Beginning’s Heaven**. At that time, the **Five Elders of the Supreme Dao** and the **Assemblage of the True Saints**, holding incense and observing the **precepts**, wandered the **Cloud Paths** and issued their command to the **Ten Heavens**. They ascended to the **Upper Palace of the Great Primordial Mysterious Auspicious Jade Capital**, the **Celestial Cold Souls’ Hall of the Supreme Dao**, and received the **Divine Decree**—only then did they comprehend the **Heavenly Truth’s** nobility and rarity, too precious to be casually heard.

Upon their return, they further consulted the **Primordial Beginning’s Celestial Sovereign** regarding the **rituals of the precepts**, humbly declining their inadequacy. Then the **Celestial Sovereign**, in compassionate benevolence, opened the **Spiritual Gate** and commanded the **Five Elders of the Supreme Dao** to reveal the ***Primordial Beginning’s Spiritually Precious Red Book of Jade Editions with True Scriptures***,* inscribed in **golden script and jade seals**, containing **subtle and secret** decrees to govern the **Great Illumination of Heaven and Earth**, the **Perfect Heavenly Incantation**, and the **Jade Chapters**. These were entrusted to the **Five Elders of the Supreme Dao** and the **Assemblage of the True Saints**, instructing them to follow the **Mysterious Teachings** and adhere to the **methods** to transmit them.

I dare to speak: I observe that at the **Five Elders’** unmanifested beginning, the **Two Qi** had not yet divided, and the **Ten Thousand Forms** had not yet emerged. Reverently considering the **Primordial Beginning’s Supreme Dao**, it **congealed the Dao’s qi** in the **Chaotic Void**, and arranged the **True Scriptures** in the **Faint and Remote** divine winds, which then fanned and caused the **Two Qi** to separate. Once the **Two Qi** divided, the **Ten Thousand Forms** began to manifest.

Then it descended the **congealed Dao’s qi** and bestowed the **arranged True Scriptures**, embedding them as the **River Luo’s** writings, thereby establishing **Human Dao** and governing the **Three Realms**. The **congealed Dao’s qi** and the **arranged True Scriptures** are what the present world calls **True Scriptures and Spiritually Precious Auspices**.

Yet the **Great True Scriptures** serve to distinguish **Heaven and Earth**, to regulate **Yin and Yang**, and to shape the **flowing and standing** of mountains and rivers, as well as the **birth and formation** of all beings—all these are the work of the **True Scriptures**. This is the **mechanism of creation and transformation**, the **divine function of Heaven and Earth**, which has yet never been transmitted to the **lower world**.

Only the **seals for guiding sentient beings, suppressing disasters, and subduing demons** are now seen in the world. These are the various **incantations** found in the ***Heavenly Incantations Section***. However, since the **scriptures** entered the world, transmitted by the **Upper True Ones** and received by the **lower immortals**, those who transmitted were not all **True Ones**, and those who received were not all **one person**, discrepancies in wording—whether detailed or concise, refined or coarse—are inevitable. Some texts, like the ***Heavenly Incantations Section’s** incantations for opening gates*, may be overly elaborate or lacking coherence, causing those who recite them to doubt their authenticity.

I humbly follow the **Golden Gate’s** decrees, diligently cross-referencing and verifying the **ancient texts**, yet I dare not further discuss the **unconnected meanings** or **incoherent phrasing** found elsewhere. Only the **concise versions** of the **scriptures** may be deemed correct, lest the world’s doubts in recitation grow fiercer.

I speak with utmost reverence. At that time, the **Eastern Divine Realm’s Incantation Decree** received by the **Ancient Elder of the Azure Celestial Sovereign** in the **Green Spiritual Capital of the Tranquil Treasure Forest**:

The **Eastern Nine Qi**, the **Azure Sovereign of the Primordial Emperor**, with **Emerald Constellations** piled high, within which dwells an **Ancient One**, overseeing and verifying the **divine diagrams and talismans**, gathering the **Qi** and elevating the **immortals**.

The **seal** here is the **precious scripture of the Azure Sovereign**—the **first twenty-four characters**, inscribed on the **Primordial Platform of the Nine Heavens**, commanding the **Nine Heavens’ Celestial Sovereigns** to verify the **divine diagrams and talismans of immortals**. The **Year Star** aids the **Liver**, while **Angle and Shen** subdue the **True**. **Dui and Fang**, **Heart and Wei**, govern the **Four Seasons** in their **cyclical rotation**.

「The **Qi** of the **Jī** constellation governs the seven stars, while **Zhèngdòu** presides over the luminous wheel.
They receive the **Qi** and capture the false, sweeping away calamities and dispersing the **non-virtue** masses.

The **seal** here is the **first thirty-two characters** of the sacred scripture, inscribed upon the **Eastern Palace of the Purple Micro** in the **Hall of Eastern Splendor**, commanding the **Celestial Officials** to rectify the **Heavenly divisions and degrees**. The **Eastern Mountain**’s divine incantation summons the **Nine Heavens**, while the **Red Book Talisman** restrains the **Assembly of the Netherworld Mountains**. Bound demons and sentient spirits are slain without reprieve—all must submit to the **Wood Palace**. Let none dare delay.

The **seal** here is the **first thirty-two characters** of the sacred scripture, inscribed in the **Eastern Splendor’s Primordial Palace**, commanding the suppression of ghosts and demons, rectifying the **Nine Heavens’ Qi**. It subdues the **Eastern River** and the **Minghai Water Spirits**. In the **Great Cataclysm** of flooding calamities, the **Qianglong** and **dragon** bear their bodies. The **Water Palace** opens its way, traversing paths of myriad thousands. The **Supreme Heaven’s Red Scriptures** dispel wind and fire without obstruction.

The **seal** here is the **first thirty-two characters** of the sacred scripture, inscribed upon the **Nine Heavens’ Northeast Jade Gate and Vermilion Platform**, commanding the suppression of the **Eastern Sea Water Sovereign**, the **Great Cataclysm** of flooding calamities, and the summoning of **Qianglong** and water spirits. To avert water disasters, inscribe this text in **yellow** upon **green paper**, recite a separate incantation, and cast it into the water to dissolve difficulties.

The **Eastern Nine Qi’s *Lingbao* Jade Chapter True Scriptures** (120 characters total) are all from the **Supreme Lord’s Most High, Great Radiant, Perfect, and Great Divine Incantation**, the **Void and Natural Texts**, also known as the *Shēngshén Bǎozhēn Dòngxuán Zhāng*, the *Eastern Mountain Divine Incantation*, and the *Azure Sovereign’s Eight Thunders’ Scripture*. The **Eastern Nine Qi’s *Lingbao* Azure Sovereign Talisman** transforms and generates the **Red Sovereign’s Qi**, the **Three Heavens’ Nine Truths**, and the **Supreme Venerable of the Great Void**. The **Minor Yang’s Qi** transforms and generates the **Great Yang’s Three Qi**—the **Vermilion Heaven**, governing the **small cataclysm of the 6th degree** and the **great cataclysm of the 7th degree**, its cycles complete. The **Red Sovereign**, bearing this scripture, attains the power to avert calamities. The talisman follows as above; inscribe it with a **cinnabar brush** upon **green silk** measuring nine inches.

The **Eastern Azure Sovereign’s Primordial Talisman** summons the **Direct Talisman of the Nine Degrees** to safeguard the *Lingbao* Heavenly Scriptures. The **Daoist** who swallows it will have **sacred Qi** subduing the liver, generating the **Nine-Leaved Treasure of Azure Vitality**, and enslaving spirits to achieve communion with the **immortals**. The **Direct Talisman of the Nine Degrees** is the **Most High Supreme True**.

The **Primordial Heavenly Light Scriptures** emerge from the **Azure Sovereign’s True Scripture Chapter**, to pacify the **Eastern Nine Qi’s Heaven**. The **Azure Sovereign** receives this scripture to subdue the **Eastern Peak**, seals one copy, and hides it in the **Nine Sacred Caverns**. It opens once every **four ten-thousand-year cycles**. Those who cultivate the **Way** and belong to the **Eastern Peak**’s domain should inscribe it in **green** upon **crimson silk** and wear it on their person.

On the day of their birth, inscribe it in **red** and wear nine copies facing east. The **Direct Talisman of the Nine Degrees** enters the body with the talisman, residing in the liver. For nine years, the **Nine-Leaved Treasure of Azure Vitality** will grow, its radiance enveloping the form in nine layers. Additionally, inscribe it in **green** upon **crimson silk**, place it within the **divine staff**, and follow the **Black Sovereign’s** upper node. Nine **jade maidens** in **green robes** will attend as guardians. Let none fail to refine—there will be reckoning.

Those who cultivate the **Way** should wear and recite the preceding talisman and seals, facing east and striking their teeth nine times. Visualize the **Azure Qi** entering the liver, generating the **Nine-Layered Radiance**, and illuminating the nape. Place the talisman before you and recite the incantation:

*"Most High Azure Vitality, Great Sacred Nine Qi.
Divine Light spreads far, flowing to the Eastern Azure.
Radiant Treasures surge forth, bathing my form.
Palaces and courts are pacified, my spirit essence self-born.
Void and Natural, eightfold clarity—
Ascend to the Jade Court."*

This is the separate incantation spoken before the talisman.

The **Eastern Azure Sovereign’s Three Primordial Talismans** command the **Nine-Degree Heavenly Sovereign**, the **Dragon Talisman** to safeguard the **True**. Though floods rage across myriad rivers, none shall dare to overflow the heavens. The **Lower Primordial** (9th degree of **Minor Yang**, 6th degree of **Great Yang**) brings great calamities. The **Azure Sovereign’s Lower Primordial Talisman** is sent to the **Eastern Peak**, preserving all things, securing the realm and its people, and regulating the **Nine Qi’s Heavenly divisions and degrees** to avert disasters for those who study it. Inscribe it in **green** upon **white silk**.

The **Central Mountain’s Divine Incantation** transforms one into a **divine minister**. It averts calamities for those whose fate is recorded. In the **Middle Primordial** (9th degree of **Great Yang**, 6th degree of **Great Yang**), crops wither and perish. The **Azure Sovereign’s Middle Primordial Talisman** is sent to the **Eastern Peak**, nurturing all things, regulating the **Heavenly divisions and degrees**, and averting great calamities for those who cultivate it. Inscribe it in **green** upon **white silk**.

The **Western Peak’s Upper Sovereign** commands preservation of the **True**. When one attains the **Way**, they serve among the **Nine Truths**. In the **Upper Primordial** (the **Great Cataclysm’s** cyclical return), the heavens and earth shift, and all—gold, jade, mountains, seas, people, birds, and beasts—are extinguished in an instant. The heavens and earth become **Mingjin**, devoid of light. The **Azure Sovereign’s Upper Primordial Talisman** is sent to the **Eastern Peak**, preserving all things, regulating the **Nine Heavens’ Qi**, and averting calamities for those who study it. These **Three Primordial Talismans** secure the **Azure Heaven’s Primordial Qi**—those who wear them attain the **Primordial portion’s** essence. This scripture emerges once every **nine thousand years**.

The **Eastern Peak’s Azure Sovereign** declares:
*"When the Great Cataclysm’s cycle returns, carve this upon **golden tablets** and wear it on your person. Inscribe it in **green** upon **white silk**."*

This is the **Jade Emperor’s** decree, bestowing upon the **Eastern Azure Sovereign of the Tranquil Treasure Forest** the **Nine Qi Heavenly Sovereign**, commanding them to govern the **Eastern realm’s** myriad heavens and earths, the **sun, moon, and stars**, the **sacred mountains and spirit caverns**, the **Water Palace and Spring Courts**, the **Supreme High Venerable and True Immortals**, and all **powerful spirits**. Where the talismans descend, they must be obeyed as decrees.

The **Southern Realm’s *Fànbǎo* Treasure of Azure Splendor, the True Old Red Sovereign’s** received divine incantations and decrees:

The **Southern Vermilion Heaven**, the **Jade Hall of the Red Sovereign**.
Within lies the Great God, named the **Red Emperor**.
Above, fiery vapors ascend, the **Three Qi** radiant in brilliance.
Divine Immortals receive their mandate, gathering at the **Great Sun**.

The following **seal-script** is the **first thirty-two characters** of the **Red Emperor’s secret text**, inscribed upon the **Nine-Heaven Cavernous Yang Hall**, commanding the summoning of the **Nine-Heaven Divine Immortals’ diagrams, talismans, and golden names**.

**Mars** aids the heart, the **Well Ghost** guards the **Room** mansion.
The **Willow Star** spreads its wings, **Kang** commands the four quarters.
**Zhen** governs the **Seven Stars**, turning the celestial order.
Summoning destiny, hastening the assembly, the **True Dao** moves swiftly.

The following **seal-script** is the **first thirty-two characters** of the **secret text**, inscribed upon the **Three-Qi Vermilion Platform**, commanding the summoning of the **Star Officials**, clarifying their degrees, and rectifying the celestial divisions.

The **Red Script’s sacred power** subdues the **Northern Acid Mountain**.
Binding and delivering the **Magical Sect**, severing the roots of evil.
Where the **talismans and teachings** strike, the crimes are clearly exposed.
The **Southern Mountain’s divine incantations** command the eight directions.
Swarms of demons perish, ten thousand felons are crushed.

The following **seal-script** is the **first forty characters** of the **secret text**, inscribed upon the **Southwest Yang Rectification Jade Gate**, commanding the governance of the **Northern Acid**, rectifying the **ghost qi**.

The **Southern Sea Water Emperor**, the **Great White Dragon King, Tai Bo**.
The divine incantations spread, sweeping away all misfortune.

The **Great Flood’s calamities** are stilled, the **Killer Whales** summoned, the **Dragons** called.
The **waterways** are opened, ten thousand paths made clear.
Any who dare to **murder and rebel** are bound and delivered to the **Fire Palace**.
The **Red Script’s decree**—none dare disobey.

The **seal-script** below is the **first forty-eight characters** of the **secret text**, inscribed upon the **Southwest Yang Rectification Western Gate**, commanding the **Southern Sea Water Emperor**, the **Great Cycle’s convergence**, when the **Great Flood surges forth**, summoning the **Killer Whales and Water Gods**.

The **Southern Three-Qi Soul Treasure Jade Chapter True Text**—*South Cloud Ascends to Heaven Treasure Spirit Pride*—
also called the **"Nine-Heavens Supreme-Supreme Incantation"**, or the **"Red Sovereign’s Eight-Awe Strategy Text"**.

The **Southern Red Sovereign’s Seal**, the **Soul Treasure Three-Qi Celestial Diagram**,

The Northern Dipper’s Mystic Void Primordial Five-Qi Soul-Treasury Black Emperor’s Three Primordial Commands
The Upper King governs the monthly command of the Heavenly Immortal, with *Xū-Wèi* producing mighty warriors, repelling the water source.

The Five-Qi Primordial Heaven, the Lower Primordial, the minor Yang of *Jiǎo* and the major Hundred of *Mǎo*—in that year, the floodwaters surged to Heaven, and the people scattered. The Soul-Treasury Black Emperor issued the Lower Primordial Talisman, descending to the Northern Peak, preserving all things, securing the state and its people, and regulating the Five-Qi Primordial Heaven’s degrees to guide the practitioner’s body.
Write in black ink on yellow silk. For those born under the three command days of *Wù*, entering the *Lì* position, assigned on task days, the effortless sovereign.

The Middle Primordial, the major Yang of *Chén-Xiū-Chǒu* and the major Hundred of *Chǒu-Wèi*—in that year, Heaven and Earth withered in drought, dust rising from the ocean’s depths, and the people perished without remnant. The Black Emperor issued the Middle Primordial Talisman, descending to the Northern Peak, guiding the myriad people, regulating Heaven’s degrees, and eliminating the drought’s calamity.
Write in black ink on yellow silk. For those born under the hundred days of *Jiǎo*, with three thousand ministers, this guides the self.

The Upper Primordial, the great calamity’s exchange—Heaven and Earth transformed, mountains and seas of gold and jade, people and beasts all annihilated at once, Heaven and Earth in chaos, with no remaining light. The Black Emperor issued the Upper Primordial Talisman, descending to the Northern Peak, preserving the seed of humanity, regulating the Nine-Heaven Qi, and guiding the practitioner.
The three Primordial Commands secure the Northern Primordial Heaven’s beginning Qi. Wearing them grants access to the Primordial’s core.
This scripture emerges once every nine thousand years.

The Black Emperor of the Northern Peak declares:
*"When the great calamity’s exchange arrives, engrave it on golden tablets to wear upon the person, written in black ink on yellow silk."*

By the Jade Sovereign’s decree, the Northern Dipper’s Mystic Void Primordial Five-Qi Soul-Treasury Black Emperor Five-Qi Heavenly Lord is commissioned to govern all Northern Heavens and Earths, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, sacred mountains and spirit caves, water palaces and spring courts, the Highest Saints, True Immortals, and Holy Assemblies—all mighty and spiritual. Where the talisman and command descend, they are to be obeyed as decreed.

The humble subject respectfully declares:

The Five Elders of the Celestial Sovereign govern the Five Heavens, and all life upon the earth falls under their dominion. None surpass their exalted role in nurturing the Mystic Dao’s creation. Therefore, when the Jade Sovereign first ascended in the Great Calamity, He bestowed the *Way* to save humanity, to curb disasters and subdue demons. The *True Scriptures of the Jade Canon* were entrusted to them, to guide those seeking Daoist cultivation, to avert celestial calamities, to still the great floods, and to restrain demonic harm—all for the sake of enriching the blessings of creation, ensuring all beings find their rightful place. The Five Elders, having received this mandate, now uphold their sacred duty.

Yet fearing the Emperor’s grace might not yet be fully extended or that living beings might still suffer, after the Jade Sovereign’s radiant manifestation, they further proclaimed and transmitted the *True Scriptures* they had received, passing them down to future generations. Ah! The Emperor’s compassion is so profound! And the Five Elders, in broadening and fulfilling this mission, are they not embodying the benevolent hearts of the Highest Saints?

The *Five-Part True Scriptures* are fully recorded in Daoist texts, with their seals and methods of invocation detailed in the various scriptures. What is now inscribed in the *Scripture of Original Practice* is but the core text. Since the *Scripture of Original Practice* centers on recitation, the core text must be preserved, though the seals and auxiliary methods may be omitted. As for all talismans, the Five-Qi *True Scriptures of the Five-Qi*, and the Three-Epoch talismans, these are likewise omitted here and recorded at the end of the scripture. Practitioners must apply them accordingly, but above all, the recitation of the true seals and core text must be performed with utmost reverence. For this text is the Jade Sovereign’s decree. When the decree is proclaimed, all spirits hear it and bow in submission. Should one treat it with negligence, reciting it carelessly as mere common scripture, uttering it lightly with lips and tongue as idle chatter, then the punishments shall be severe—just as recorded in the *Chapter on Retribution and Response*. Those who recite the scripture must venerate it with solemn devotion. The humble subject respectfully declares this.

The Dao proclaims: This is the Great Divine Spell—the Primordial’s wondrous speech, the Jade Sovereign’s true decree, the Upper Clarity’s natural sacred text, the Primordial Five-Heavens’ mystic tablet, the void’s luminous chapter, the Highest Saints’ secret utterance, the Celestial Dawn’s exalted canon. It establishes Heaven and Earth, unfurls myriad truths, calms the spirit and subdues the numinous, nurtures and sustains the myriad peoples, rectifies and governs the cosmic order, and preserves eternal Heaven. It governs celestial mechanisms above, inspects the Five Spirits in the middle, strategizes earthly deities below, commands the Yellow River’s source, directs the forces of yin and yang, and summons gods while dispatching immortals. This is the ultimate true text—its divine efficacy is spontaneous. It clarifies the heavens, stabilizes the earth, and safeguards the Five Sacred Peaks, ensuring all things endure. The Jade Sovereign once bestowed it upon the Five Elders of the Celestial Sovereign. At that time, the Five Emperors knelt, reverently receiving the tablet, and secretly inscribed it in the Hall of the Spirit Capital. The Primordial True Man formerly recorded this text and entrusted it to the Upper Clarity’s True Realm, the Supreme Mystic Jade Capital, the Cold Spirit Hall of the Purple Micro, enduring through countless kalpas, its essence preserved at the Heavenly Root, uncorrupted and unlost, shifting with the cosmic cycles. This Great Divine Spell is undefiled by mixture, its purity only deepened by defilement; it cannot be destroyed by ruin, for ruin only reveals its brilliance. It is the Great One’s text, revered by the Primordial True—from the Radiant #3 True Name, inscribed on imperial tablets, revealed to future generations. This sacred text is hidden and secret, not to be glimpsed or heard by any. Those who attain it shall preserve the eternal *qi* and, through diligent practice, attain divinity.

The humble subject respectfully declares: The *Five-Part Jade Book True Scriptures* possess divine functions beyond measure. If one obtains the *Scriptures for Guiding and Recording Immortals* and applies them, then the Nine-Heavens’ assembled immortals shall be recorded in the celestial registers, and their *qi* shall be transmitted to guide them. If one obtains the *Scriptures for Governing Stars* and applies them, then the sun, moon, and stars shall shine upon one’s form, the constellations shall ward off misfortune, and life, spirit, *qi*, and fate shall suffer no destruction. If one obtains the *Scriptures for Subduing Demons* and applies them, then the Northern Underworld shall fear its might, ten thousand demons shall be bound, and a hundred evils shall tremble in reverence, daring not to encroach. If one obtains the *Scriptures for Governing Water* and applies them, then the ten thousand dragons shall protect their forms, the Water Palaces shall revere in awe, and on the day of cosmic destruction, one may ride the great serpents and ascend the Nine Heavens. Ah! The divine functions and marvelous efficacy—can they truly be measured?

Yet the methods of application hold secret keys, not all of which common folk may attain. Only those who seek the Dao must emulate these methods and practice them diligently. Thus the scripture says: *"Those who attain it shall preserve the eternal qi and, through diligent practice, attain divinity."* The humble subject, having verified the scripture, dares not omit its essentials and thus informs those who come after. May the Highest Saints look upon this with favor. The humble subject, Liang, respectfully declares.

**Volume: *Dòngxiān Língbǎo Yùhuáng Gōngdé Pǐn* (The Third Chapter on the Virtue and Merit of the Jade Emperor of the Cavernous Mystery Treasure)**

At that time, the Jade Void Emperor spoke to the Celestial Worthy: *"May Your Compassion endure. May You benefit the Four Assemblies, the *Devā* (天尊), the Four Heavenly Kings, all the celestial beings, all the immortals, and all future beings who uphold and proclaim this scripture."*

The Celestial Worthy then said to the Jade Void Emperor: *"How splendid this question! Is it not excellent?"*
*"You, moved by compassion and pity for all beings, thus inquire of me."*

The Celestial Worthy said: *"Should any in the Three Realms and the Ten Directions—whether a kingdom’s ruler, great ministers, or common folk—face war’s outbreak, rampant pestilence, drought, flood, locusts, or famine, then the sovereign, the queen, the crown prince, the prime ministers, and the great ministers must awaken their compassion. They shall universally command the officials of their domains and prefectures to purify and sanctify the Daoist adepts (*dàoliú*). Within their temples, they shall establish grand fasting and exorcistic rites (*zhāijiào*), practicing the Dao at all six times of day, to circulate this scripture. Thus, the land shall know peace, the five grains shall flourish, and the people shall prosper in security."*

The humble subject respectfully declares: *"There is a saying in the world: ‘Sacrificial feathers cannot dispel a siege, and a village feast cannot halt a war.’ This is the natural order of affairs. Bold bandits first take up arms, and robbers and traitors first harbor treacherous intentions. Unless wisdom and strategy surpass them, or valor and strength overcome them, their tyranny shall never be thwarted.*

*Yet now, within the *Yùdì Jīng*, it is said that when war erupts, one must command the officials and commoners to have the Daoist adepts recite the True Scripture to quell it—how absurd! Alas, this is far from correct. When celestial omens manifest above, terrestrial calamities arise below; war and strife stem from the discord of yin and yang, the entanglement of fate and chaos, and only then do disasters spread and chaos erupt. Examining past records confirms this truth.*

*Thus, the scripture’s teaching is this: when a state faces turmoil, one must use this method to appease and invoke the heavens, to dissipate celestial omens and quell terrestrial calamities—not to suppress rebellion with this scripture alone. As for arming soldiers, fortifying walls, and deepening moats, can these ever be abandoned for a single day?*

*In the past, there were foolish rulers, their vision obscured, who claimed that Buddhist and Daoist scriptures and spells could repel enemies. They soon met with disaster, inviting ridicule, and to this day, their shame endures—a pity indeed. Now, those in the world who misunderstand this scripture often cite it as grounds for slander. The humble subject, Liang, dares to correct this through verification of the text."*

**If one enters the mountains and forests and encounters venomous or ferocious beasts, but merely retains the thought and recites this True Scripture with sincerity, the mountain spirits shall guard and protect, the wild beasts shall retreat, and harm shall never befall them.**

**If one enters rivers or seas to gather treasures and rare gems and encounters fierce winds, and recites this True Scripture according to the method, the winds and waves shall instantly cease, and they shall reach the shore in safety.**

**If one is in battle, with spears and blades already clashing, and in their heart silently recites this True Scripture, then all evil bandits shall retreat and disperse.**

**If one is imprisoned in shackles and stocks, with a pure heart and steady mind, and recites this True Scripture, wrongs shall be righted, and liberation shall be attained.**

**If one is tormented by malevolent spirits or demonic assailants, and recites this True Scripture according to the method, the evil shall flee, and the affliction shall naturally be cured.**

**If one seeks descendants, and with reverence recites this True Scripture according to the method, the Jade Emperor shall command the Celestial Registrar to inspect the *Dānjí* (Register of the Immortal), and among the Nine Ranks, the Four Fruits of Immortality, one whose fate aligns shall descend and be reborn as their child—endowed with eloquence and wisdom, held in honor among mortals.**

**If a woman faces a perilous pregnancy, and recites this True Scripture according to the method, she shall give birth safely, bearing a son or daughter of virtue and fortune, beloved by all.**

**If one seeks advancement in office or noble favor at court, and recites this True Scripture according to the method, their rank shall ascend, their descendants shall prosper, and their lineage shall endure for generations.**

**If one desires wealth and abundance, and with devotion recites this True Scripture, their treasures shall overflow, their sustenance shall be effortless, and blessings shall flow to their descendants, passed down through the ages.**

**If one is afflicted by malevolent stars, suffering in misery, and recites this True Scripture according to the method, those stars shall retreat and bring forth auspicious fortune.**

**If one’s lifespan has ended and they are destined for the underworld, their name recorded in the Register of Evil, then their parents, teachers, spouses, and children must recite this True Scripture for them—or establish a Daoist ritual site with banners and floral offerings. Thus, the deceased’s evil record shall be erased, and their spirit shall be reborn in a Pure Land. All suffering souls shall be protected and guided, attaining this supreme victory and ascending to the heavens.**

**Moreover, wherever this scripture resides, the Ten Heavenly *Zhìzhēn Dàshèng Wújí Fēitiān Shénwáng* (Supreme True Saints of the Boundless Flying Celestial) shall always attend and venerate it. Those who uphold this scripture may rightfully call themselves *Zhèngyī Zhēnrén* (Orthodox True Persons). Such individuals, wherever they go, shall be invisibly guarded by the *Jīnjiāng Lìshì* (Golden-Armored Vajra Warriors) from the Ten Directions—protecting them as their own body. Whether entering or exiting, in all their movements, malevolent forces shall avoid their path, demons shall be exterminated, spirits shall cower, and all calamities shall be powerless to approach.**

「When the life of one who upholds this scripture draws to its end, they shall not witness the dreadful forms of the underworlds, but instead shall see all the celestial palaces filled with jade maidens bearing banners to welcome them, ascending to the heavens.

Should their celestial blessings be exhausted and they descend into the mortal realm, they shall perpetually be reborn as emperors and kings throughout countless lifetimes, ensuring the land remains serene and the people prosper in their livelihoods. Moreover, they shall attain the nature of their former lives, follow the Dao/Way, and through successive cultivation, ultimately reach the shore of transcendence.

Such are the blessings bestowed upon those who uphold this scripture.

Furthermore, if one who upholds this scripture, when rain falls, awakens a great compassion and, as prescribed, recites this scripture three times in the direction of the sky, all beings touched by the rain or within the direction they face—those who have committed the Five Treasons and Ten Evils, or any grave offenses—shall have their sins utterly eradicated, and all severe illnesses shall be instantly cured.

These beings, upon death, shall not fall into the underworlds but be reborn in Pure Lands, emerging from lotus flowers. How much more so shall those who uphold this scripture themselves!

Again, if one who upholds this scripture walks along a path when a great wind arises and blows, the dust that touches their body shall, upon contact, cause all beings in the direction it settles to have their evil deeds entirely extinguished. They shall not be reborn in the Three Evil Paths but ascend to the heavens.

Thus, the virtues of upholding this scripture are beyond reckoning.

If one who upholds this scripture bathes in rivers, lakes, or seas, the water touching their body shall purify all beings within it—fish, turtles, crocodiles, and all aquatic creatures—clearing away their sins. After this single lifetime, upon their death, they shall no longer be reborn in any form, whether as an embryo, egg, or wet-born being.

The words spoken by one who upholds this scripture, whether good or evil, shall all be heard by celestial and demonic forces, the Ten Directions, and external Dao/Way sects, as pure and sacred teachings.

If one who upholds this scripture encounters any shrine of the gods, they may recite this scripture for its deity. All spirits and gods who hear it shall escape their ghostly fate, ascend to the path of true immortals, and revere this person as they would an emperor.

Should a person in this world fail to honor their parents, disrespect the Three Jewels, engage in killing, theft, licentiousness, or false speech, and commit countless grave offenses, and upon nearing death, if there are any with a Dao/Way-heart and true faith in all beings, they may, during the dying person’s last breaths, awaken great compassion and invoke the name of the Emperor at their head—whether seven times, fourteen times, twenty-one times, twenty-eight times, up to a hundred or a thousand recitations—thus all the unvirtuous deeds committed in their lifetime shall be utterly eradicated. They shall not fall into any evil realm, and their spirit shall ascend to the Nine Heavens. How much more so shall those who uphold and receive this scripture!

Again, if one has, from past kalpas until this very life, cycled through human and heavenly realms, drifted across all worlds, accumulating myriad sins and transgressions, and if they merely encounter the shadow of one who upholds this scripture cast upon their body—or are illuminated by the Emperor’s light—or hear their words, or even converse with them—as though receiving the Emperor’s spoken teachings and consolation—then their sins and obstacles shall be permanently removed.

If one who upholds this scripture crafts a long banner and inscribes the Emperor’s name upon it, raising it on tall poles, whether in temples or households, and the wind blows it, pointing in any direction, all beings in that path shall attain supreme victory, and their evil deeds shall be utterly eradicated.

If one who upholds this scripture writes the Emperor’s name upon any resonant object—whether bells, chimes, gongs, or drums—all ritual implements and Dao/Way instruments, whether used in a Dao/Way hall, struck in a ceremony, or touched by the wind, their sound, near or far, shall cause all beings who hear it to have their sins and obstacles completely purified.

If one who upholds this scripture, having penetrated the mysteries of birth and death, retreats into the mountains and forests to cultivate true virtue and learn the Dao/Way, and at times ascends to gaze upon the world, wherever their eyes reach—across mountains, forests, streams, and valleys—all living beings, whether formed or formless, born from eggs, wombs, or moisture, and all mobile or rooted creatures, shall have their sins permanently removed. Their body and mind shall be cleansed, and upon death, they shall be reborn in the heavens. How much more so shall those who uphold and receive this scripture!

Know that such a person is indeed the embodiment of the Dao/Way’s treasury of virtues.

Your humble servant respectfully states: The words of the Heavenly Sage are true and not false, genuine and not fraudulent.

Yet, those who are ignorant in this world and lack true understanding, seeing only superficial interpretations, may even doubt minor passages in other scriptures, assuming no such principles exist in the world. Alas! Why do they not carefully examine and deeply investigate, pondering and savoring the meaning, rather than seeking it in convoluted ways?

In the *Function and Virtue Chapter*, the Heavenly Sage speaks of the blessings attained by those who uphold the scripture—such as dying and ascending to the heavens, or being reborn as emperors and kings across countless lifetimes. He also describes how, when reciting the scripture during rain, walking paths during windstorms, bathing in water, gazing upon mountains, or casting shadows, they can bestow upon all beings the eradication of their sins and the attainment of great virtues—yet some claim no such principles exist.

They say that the blessings of emperors and kings are too lofty to be surpassed, and that the virtues of reciting scriptures cannot truly be attained or verified.

Much less could one perpetually be reborn as an emperor or king across countless lifetimes!

They further claim that the blessings of reciting scriptures may apply to oneself, but not to beings burdened with grave sins and transgressions, who suffer retribution across four lives. This is the unalterable decree of the heavens, not a single hair’s breadth can be changed. Even if the scripture endures for a hundred kalpas without perishing, the fruit of karma must still be borne by oneself. How could the body of one who recites the scripture, in a single passing, instantly liberate them and grant such blessings?»

This speaker’s words reveal only half the truth, not the whole.

Indeed, to walk the Dao of Yao is to embody Yao’s own self—
to emulate Yan’s conduct is to follow in Yan’s footsteps.
Yet now there are those who, with this scripture,
morning and evening recite its words,
hurry and step in accordance with its precepts,
delve into the *Benxing Jing* and practice its teachings,
chew its essence and savor its spirit,
imitating the Ten Marvelous Practices and upholding them in action,
observing all prohibitions with strict devotion and keeping far from them,
guarding it with firm resolve and holding it with unwavering sincerity,
evermore enduring without wavering, even when obstructed,
day by day, month by month,
until their form blends seamlessly with that of the Jade Sovereign,
ascending or descending at His side—
then that body is the Sovereign’s body,
and the Sovereign’s body is that of the practitioner.

Once their forms merge,
the virtues and powers that arise—
how could they differ?

When the Jade Sovereign emits His radiance,
His divine transformations are so vast and grand—
then those who recite this scripture,
wherever they go and whatever they do,
shall bestow blessings upon all beings,
just as the Sovereign’s grace and light pervade all.

Yet these words,
spoken by the Celestial Lord,
refer to those who recite and uphold this scripture
with purity, uniting wholly with the Sovereign—
not to those who merely chant it aloud,
mouthing words without true devotion.
Still, even if one begins with mere chanting,
unceasing in recitation until their essence merges with the Sovereign’s,
then their claim as a True Person of the One Dao
hardly does justice to their virtue and conduct.

Scholars should ponder these words and act accordingly.
Your humble servant, Liang, speaks thus.

At that time, the Celestial Lord addressed the Jade Emperor of the Upper Pure Realm:
*"I have spoken briefly,
yet not exhausted its profundity.
If I were to expound fully,
all who hold heretical views
would only grow more doubtful and unbelieving.
The virtues of this scripture
are boundless—even kalpas cannot encompass them."*

When the Jade Emperor of the Upper Pure Realm heard these words,
His heart filled with joy,
unable to contain His exultation.
Gazing upon the Lord’s benevolent countenance,
He bowed in reverence and composed a hymn:

Above the Nine Heavens,
lies the Great Luo.
Jade Capital, golden gates,
clouds piled high and majestic.
Within resides the Celestial Sovereign,
kind and benevolent, compassionate and harmonious.
His Dao is peerless,
subduing all demons.
The Heavenly Treasure is His sacred talisman,
Jade precepts and golden laws.
Countless immortals and deities,
their banners and flags in abundance.
Those who hear this scripture
shall have their sins erased,
forever freed from the River of Suffering.
This is the Jade Sovereign,
the True Venerable of the Vaulted Sky,
the Perfect Circle of Purity,
possessing wisdom and eloquence,
the Dao most exalted,
the Teacher of the Three Realms,
the Ancestor of the Mixed Element,
unmatched in dominion,
the Merciful Father of the Four Generations,
the Most Holy of the Highest Heavens,
the Great Compassionate and Benevolent One.
Ten names complete,
ten thousand virtues embodied,
limitless in liberating beings,
extracting them from the苦 of birth and death.

When the Jade Emperor of the Upper Pure Realm spoke this hymn and its ten names,
all the celestial hosts in unison
exclaimed in wonderment at what they had never before heard.

Your humble servant, Liang, speaks thus:
*"When the heart takes delight,
the words overflow beyond measure.
Thus, the Jade Emperor’s praise
exalts and extols,
speaking of virtues with utmost fervor,
seeking to fully express the Sovereign’s power.
Ah! The Sovereign’s virtue is so vast—
how could it ever be fully spoken?
Your servant dares to say that silence itself is the highest praise,
truly reflecting the Sovereign’s glory as the Upper Pure Lord does."*

Your humble servant, Liang, speaks thus.

From the *Highest Jade Sovereign’s Original Practices Scripture*, Volume #6 *"The Emperor"*,
the original text reads *"The King"*.
The seventh passage, *"compatible with the Emperor’s nature and attain enlightenment"*,
the original text reads *"constantly attain enlightenment of the nature"*.

Volume Two, *The Chapter on the Celestial True Ones’ Protection*
At that time, the Emperor of the Vaulted Sky, upon hearing the scripture’s teachings,
rose from His seat and knelt long before the Sovereign,
addressing the Jade Emperor:
*"Your servant, the Emperor of the Vaulted Sky,
prays that You may hold this scripture
and proclaim its benefits to all beings and celestial hosts.
May You protect those who uphold this scripture."*

Then the Jade Sovereign, moved by compassion,
opened the gate of blessings,
proclaimed the *Yugai Ke* (Jade Treasury Scripture),
and transmitted the *Lingbao Fa* (Sacred Treasure Teachings),
telling the Emperor of the Vaulted Sky:
*"Now listen carefully,
for I shall speak of the virtues of upholding this scripture—
its power to rescue the perilous, extract the suffering,
benefit the living and the dead,
and reveal its divine and mysterious truths."*

The Celestial True Ones bowed in reverence,
all speaking in unison:
*"Your disciples and humble servants
today have the fortune to hear this eternal, unchanging law.
May it bring blessings to all three realms and heavens above,
and below, may it dispel the poisons of the Three Lower Paths.
With Your boundless compassion,
pitying our lowly state,
please expound this profound meaning."*

The Jade Sovereign replied:
*"If any being
honors their parents with filial devotion,
respects the Three Treasures with reverence,
lends their utmost loyalty to their ruler,
commits neither murder nor theft,
neither lewdness nor jealousy,
neither anger nor grudges,
neither arrogance nor deceit,
and upholds the precepts while keeping fasts,
devoting their hearts to the Great Dao,
nurturing a mind of reverence,
and reciting this scripture,
I shall decree that it be spread throughout the Jambudvīpa (continent of the east),
transmitted to all ten directions of the boundless world.
I command the Eastern Hua Emperor,
with His green cavalry, immortal troops, and countless legions,
to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.
I command the Great Boshan Emperor of the Southeast,
with His divine hosts, immortal troops, and countless legions,
to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.
I command the Great Zhuling Emperor of the South,
with His red cavalry, immortal troops, and countless legions,
to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.
I command the Elder Taihua of the Southwest,
with His divine hosts, immortal troops, and countless legions,
to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.
I command the Yellow Old Master of the Western Hua,
with His white cavalry, immortal troops, and countless legions,
to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.
I command the Jade Sovereign of the Northwest,
with His divine hosts, immortal troops, and countless legions,
to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.
I command the Purple Micro Emperor of the North,
with His black cavalry, immortal troops, and countless legions,
to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture."*

I command the **Crashing Void Heavenly Lord** of the Northeast,
with His divine hosts, immortal troops, and countless legions,
to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.

I command the **Central Heavenly Sovereign Emperor Kunlun the Aged**,
with His yellow cavalry of the **Kunlun Celestial Old Master**,
His divine hosts, immortal troops, and countless legions,
to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.

I command the **Heavenly Lord of the Upper Realm, Laihe**,
with the immortal troops of mountains and great caves,
and countless legions,
to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.

I command all **Golden Immortals** of the Lower Realm,
with the **Fourfold and Eightfold Assemblies** and their retinues,
to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.

I command the **Ten Directions of Flying Heavenly Kings**,
the **Flying Heavenly Deities**, the **Three Officials and Four Saints**,
the **Nine Bright Stars**, the **Northern Dipper and Southern Dipper**,
the **Eastern Dipper and Western Dipper**, the **Central Dipper**,
the **Twenty-Eight Constellations**, the **Circumambient Heavenly Hosts**,
the **Vajra Warriors**, and the **Divine Kings**,
each with their retinues,
to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.

I command the **Subduing Demon Vajra Warriors**,
the **Four Heavenly Gate Kings**, the **Five Sacred Mountains and Four Great Rivers**,
and all remaining mountains,
the **Four Seas and Nine Rivers**, the **Twelve River Sources**,
the **forest spirits, water demons, and marsh demons**,
and all their rulers,
to descend with their retinues,
protecting all who uphold this scripture,
and ensuring safety in all perilous and treacherous places.

I command all **local land spirits** and **great-power ghost kings** of streams and ditches,
to protect all who uphold this scripture,
and to subdue all malevolent demons and heterodox spirits,
forcing them to shrink in fear, vanish, or flee—
soaring high into the heavens, escaping to distant shores,
or avoiding other realms.

Thus, all **mountain, forest, ancestral, and temple guests** who partake in blood sacrifices,
and all **ghosts and spirits**,
shall naturally be extinguished.

The **Five Directions’ Pestilence and Plague Ghost Marshals**,
all **evil ghosts and spirits**,
as well as the **Wind Kings and Water Monsters**,
the **Sinspawn Dragons and Demon Spirits**,
and **earthly and wooden demons**,
shall all be extinguished,
and thus the **five voids and six depletions**,
the **unusual dreams and nightmares**,
the **sorcery and curses of wild paths**,
and all **poisonous hexes and toxins**,
shall be vanquished.

For those who wish with sincerity,
all desires shall be fulfilled,
and all wishes shall be satisfied.

Those who uphold this scripture—
whether they do not follow the prescribed teachings,
cannot observe fasts,
or lack pure precepts—
yet still revere and honor its virtue,
admire and cherish this sacred text,
and also those who, together with them,
observe fasts and guard pure precepts—
their **merits and virtues** shall be boundless,
unobstructed, and free,
making them **saints among mortals**,
with ever-renewing wisdom and virtue,
equal to all **True Persons**.

Thus I humbly say:
The merits of reciting this scripture
have already been spoken of by the Heavenly Lord,
yet the **August Heavenly Emperor** still deems it incomplete.
At this time,
I again respectfully petition before the Emperor,
seeking to make it fully thorough.

This is truly the **Supreme Sage’s** compassionate heart,
desiring to guide all beings
to uphold and recite this scripture,
and hoping the Emperor will grant abundant blessings.

The **Jade Emperor’s** compassionate vow is vast and boundless,
thus at this time,
He declares and proclaims clearly,
from beginning to end,
with nothing omitted or left unfinished.
From the **East** He begins,
and to the **Ten Directions of All Spirits** He concludes,
leaving none unaccounted for.

This is to ensure that all who embrace the **scripture’s efficacy**,
whether near or far,
shall receive the **spirits’** harmonious aid.

Yet the weight of the Emperor’s decree,
though all-encompassing,
first emphasizes **loyalty, filial piety**, and such matters,
for only those who can be **loyal and filial**,
reverent and respectful,
who do not kill or steal,
who do not commit adultery or envy,
who do not harbor anger or resentment,
who do not act arrogantly or deceive,
who observe precepts and keep fasts,
who focus their minds on the **Great Dao**,
and who strictly follow each word of the Emperor’s decree—
only then shall the **Ten Directions of All Spirits** truly protect and uphold them,
as the Emperor commands.

If they fail to do so,
even if they recite with lips and cheeks,
I cannot guarantee that the **Ten Directions of All Spirits** will fully protect them.

Although **pure precepts** refer to the prior matters of loyalty and filial piety,
the Jade Emperor’s expectations are indeed strict.

Yet among the **Three Realms**,
beings differ in their **roots and capacities**,
and if one does not distinguish between the wise and the foolish,
and holds all to the same standard,
then few will truly possess these pure precepts.

The Emperor’s **virtue and power** are compassionate and boundless,
His **ren love** vast and profound,
thus at the end of His proclamation,
He again issues a **Jade Decree**, saying:

*"Even those who do not follow the prescribed teachings,
cannot observe fasts,
or lack pure precepts—
yet still revere and honor its virtue,
and whose wisdom and virtue equal that of the True Persons—
ah! This is not the Jade Emperor’s strictness,
for He does not abandon the **Way** for all under Heaven,
nor would such a decree exist otherwise.*

*The dull-witted and lowly among mortals
should heed the Emperor’s decree,
first cultivating a heart of reverence and admiration,
then ascending higher,
so as to hope for the aid of the **Ten Directions of All Spirits**.*

*Yet one cannot presume that the Emperor’s decree
will overlook those who fail to observe fasts
or keep pure precepts,
and who remain idle and negligent.*

Thus I speak with utmost care.

At that time, the **August Heavenly Emperor**, having heard these words,
immediately composed a hymn before the Emperor, saying:

「Great is the **Dao** of Ultimate **Way**,
formless, nameless.

Vast and boundless through countless **eons**,
the Yellow **Dao** clears and opens.

Divine and bright, its radiance shines—
the Nine Souls emit their essence.

The Jade **Dao** is pure and luminous—
the Great **Xia** ascends in splendor.

The Jade Emperor manifests creation,
universally nurturing all under Heaven and **humans**.

The Three Primordials nourish the **Dao**,
the Two Symbols govern life.

Rotten trees, withered roots,
once dead, now flourish anew.

Lifeless beings stir and breathe—
transformed into **immortal** forms.

Conception and gestation alike,
all achieve birth and completion.

The departed, their **life-force** spent,
return their souls to the Three **Qing**.

Their **spirits** undergo refinement,
ascending to the Southern Palace.

This day is grand and auspicious—
all attain radiant clarity.

The Five Emperors observe and reflect,
proclaiming to all **spirits**.

Celestial **Gods** and Earthly **spirits**,
along with river deities,

the Five Sacred Peaks and Four Great Passes,
and all named mountains,

the **Tongxuan** and **Tongxu** deities,
the **Tongkong** and **Tongxian** spirits,

the **Great Sage of the Boundless**,
the **Most Venerable True One**,

Boundless and infinite in scope,
universally overseeing and refining life.

Evil roots are severed and erased,
the **Mysterious Capital** records their names.

All **True Ones** gather in ranks,
hear the Emperor’s words.

This is the Emperor’s decree—
reverently recite and uphold it.

The **Dao**’s ultimate refinement,
never allow calamity to intrude.

I obey the Emperor’s command,
all shall heed in full.

At that time, the **August Heavenly Emperor** spoke these verses,
declaring to the assembly:
*"This is the Jade Emperor’s wondrous **Dao**-utterance,
the **True Ones**’ hidden and profound words.
The path is absolute, the **Dao** is severed—
so subtle, so profound it defies thought.

Majestic and vast, the **Great Standard**,
the origin of all **Divine Clarity**,
protecting and upholding the land,
extracting and refining life and death."*

When the **Heavenly Venerable** spoke these words,
the **Law Assembly**’s pure gathering all revered the **Dao**-utterance,
universally attaining enlightenment.

Then the **Heavenly Venerable** proclaimed the **gāthā**:
*"The Jade Emperor’s virtue is vast,
His **mysterious principles** most profound.
Born before the **Great Calamity**,
His transformations span ancient and modern times.

Now I expound this **wondrous sutra**,
out of compassion for all **sentient beings**.
This is indeed the **most supreme dharma**,
the greatest of all virtues.

The **name** of the highest **vehicle**,
unmatched, the first among equals.

The **Great Radiant Sovereign**’s awe-inspiring **virtue**,
His saintly **power** rare and wondrous.

He can subdue the violent and malevolent **demons**,
all make their hearts bow in submission.

He can erase the most grievous **karma**,
all attain **purity** and **clarity**.

If mortals hear this **sutra**,
or hear the Emperor’s **name**,
and bow in **devotion**,
all their **sins** shall vanish and be extinguished.

The **Ten Evils** and **Four Great Transgressions**,
the **Five Great Filial Disobediences** that harm parents—
with **faith** and but one invocation,
all their **karmic retributions** dissolve with the sound.

He protects **human** and **celestial** assemblies,
from the **Four Signs of Decay** to the **Five Great Calamities**,
from the **Three Paths of Suffering** to mortal **afflictions** in the human realm.

Years of famine and pestilence,
poisonous drugs and **malevolent charms**,
unjust trials and **enemies of fate**,
battles in the **army’s encampments**—all their torments.

In the **wilds**, malevolent **paths**,
where **tigers**, **leopards**, wolves, and **jackals** dwell,
in the **seas**, venomous **dragons**,
and the swift **thunder**, **winds**, and **hail**.

**Water**, **fire**, and **thieves**,
**poisonous curses** of the heart,
losing **mind** and descending into madness,
**snakes**, **demons**, and **evil insects**.

Wicked **demons**, fierce **spirits**, and **gods**,
who lurk to seize mortal opportunities—
through holding this **true sutra**,
all disperse and perish of their own accord.

Prolonged **illnesses** and lingering **suffering**,
restless even in dreams—
unjust desires that seek to **destroy life**,
extermination shall not bring **retribution** as their **fate**.

By encountering this **sutra**,
one attains **peace** and **freedom**.

All **wishes** for **blessings**,
wealth and **honor**—
through this **sutra**’s virtue,
all shall be fulfilled as one’s **heart’s desire**.

**Gods of威** and **自在**,
all **virtues** of the **Eleven Luminaries**,
the **Thirty-two Heavenly Sovereigns**,
the **Twenty-eight Constellations’ Kings**,
the **Spiritual Consorts** and **Jade Maidens**,
**celestial gods** and **earthly spirits**.

The **Three Realms’ deities**, the **void’s spirits**,
all **dragon kings** of the **rivers and seas**,
**gods of water**, **fire**, and **wind**,
palaces and **dwellings** alike.

The **multitudes** of **mountains, forests, trees**,
and **spirits** of **gullies, ditches, wells, and springs**—
through holding this **sutra**,
all shall guard and protect.

**Clothing and food** shall come naturally,
**children and grandchildren** dwell in **wealth and honor**.

Words spoken shall be **rarely heard**,
wherever one goes, all shall show **reverence**.

If seeking **sons or daughters**,
recite and uphold this **true sutra**,
the Emperor’s decree descends to the **Heavenly Registries**,
and **heavenly beings** are born in their **families**.

As **noble offspring**, they are **venerated and honored**,
the **seven generations** all ascend to **immortality**.

Their **gates** are illuminated in **glory**,
extending even to their **parents**.
**Auspiciousness** burns ever bright and grand,
**calamities** cannot intrude.

Thus I now proclaim—
all should listen with **earnest attention**.
With **compassion**, all are refined to **Upper Purity**."

Then the **Heavenly Venerable** universally declared to the **Four Assemblies**:
*"Mortals who hold and recite this **sutra**,
who receive the Emperor’s **name**,
have deep **Dao-roots** and **karmic affinities**.
This **sutra** is most **venerable and wondrous**,
universally refining **heavenly beings** and **humans**.

But with **sincere hearts** and **reverent devotion**,
their **families and nations** shall be **at peace**,
their **lives protected**, **calamities averted**,
all **inauspiciousness** swept away.

**Kings and nobles** who uphold it,
shall bring **great peace** to their **realms**,
**wicked invaders** shall be **pacified**,
**borderlands** shall not be **contested**,
the **myriad people** shall **sing in joy**,
and all under **Heaven** shall **thrive**.

The **cosmic cycles** shall be **propelled**,
the **true path** shall **prevail**.
Those who obtain it,
shall be **Heaven’s True Ones**, most **venerable**—
it must be **kept secret**, most **secret**.

I speak with utmost **earnestness**:
*The Jade Emperor’s decree,
its **urgent warnings** are thorough and complete,
already reaching the utmost **truth**,
yet the **August Heavenly Emperor’s** praise
and the **Heavenly Venerable’s** **gāthā**
are still so **detailed and meticulous**.

For the **Supreme Saints** and **Highest True Ones**,
their love for mortals is profound—
thus they **display and verify**,
unwearied in **repetition**,
determined that all **sentient beings** shall **believe and uphold**.

If the Emperor’s decree is thus,
and the **Heavenly Venerable’s** words are likewise,
then the **effects** of recitation
shall **unfailingly** match the **sutra**’s **recordings**.

I speak again to **urge all mortals** to **cherish and believe**.
I speak no more.

---
*At that time, the **Compassionate and Merciful True Person Who Degrees Suffering**,
the **True Person Who Seeks Voices to Save Pain**,
the **True Person Who Rescues Life and Degrees Death**,
and the **True Person Who Bestows Ten Thousand Blessings and Guards the Body**,
all rose from their seats,
stepped beyond their ranks,
and together addressed the **Heavenly Venerable**:
*"If mortals in the **end times**,
though they have **karmic affinities** from past lives,
encounter this **sutra**,
yet are **defiled by malevolent spirits**,
and **doubt and confusion** pervade their **beginning and end**,
not believing in this **sutra**’s virtue—
what **karmic retributions** shall they face
**now and in the past** in all the **hells**?"*

I now humbly pray to Your Sacred Mercy
to speak of the sufferings of the **karmic retributions in evil realms**.

At that time, the **Heavenly Venerable** addressed the four **True Persons**:
*"For those fierce, violent, and wicked beings in the world,
who day and night stand before **Dao/Way** images
without reverence,
uttering blasphemous words—
their crime deserves to fall into the **Five Uninterrupted Hells**.
Yet if they encounter one who upholds this **sutra**,
who through all means entices and persuades them,
and thus temporarily extinguish their evil thoughts,
and take faith in this **sutra**,
then their crimes and karmic debts are utterly purified, leaving no trace.

Again, if there are those with perverse views and stubborn delusions,
who see one reciting this **sutra**,
and harbor malice,
casting sidelong glances or even harboring a single evil thought,
uttering a single evil word,
defaming and slandering those who uphold this **sutra**—
their offense is such that,
after death,
they fall into the **Great Hell**,
with no hope of escape.

How much worse for those in the world
who encounter this **sutra**,
yet fail to show reverence,
touching it with impure hands,
reciting it with unclean mouths,
placing it on defiled beds,
or reading it aloud while speaking vulgarities,
laughing and jesting as if it were a common text.
Such beings,
after death,
fall into the **Uninterrupted Hell**,
with no hope of escape.
Their misfortunes extend to nine generations,
suffering under the **Nine Judges of the Underworld**,
afflicting their descendants through endless calamities.
In the **Hell Realms**, they endure unimaginable suffering for countless eons,
encountering countless **Sages** who repeatedly rescue them,
yet their crimes diminish only slightly.

Again, when rescued by a **Sage** and reborn as a **Hungry Ghost**,
they wander for thousands of millions of eons,
never hearing the name of water or food.
When their **Ghostly Retribution** ends,
they are reborn as **Animals**,
and from there,
if reborn as humans,
they become barbarians, heretics,
or are born as women,
suffering poverty, deformity, and a hundred ailments,
enduring unimaginable torments,
cast aside by all,
neither able to live nor die.
Thus, those who slight this **sutra** incur such karmic consequences.

Again, if there are those who,
though initially believing,
later grow negligent and arrogant—
the **Youths of Virtue and Vice** report them to the **Three Officials**,
their names are added to the **Black Registers**,
their merits subtracted from the **Blue Ledgers**,
and after death,
they are imprisoned in dark dungeons,
trapped in the **Three Paths of Retribution**,
with no means of liberation.
Or in this very life,
they suffer countless diseases—
**scabies, epilepsy, leprosy, and ulcers**—
as their just retribution.
They are tormented by sorrow and suffering day and night;
or they are harmed by violent forces,
imprisoned in chains,
wrongfully taking their own lives,
poisoned by toxins,
devoured by tigers, wolves, or venomous snakes,
slain by enemies,
or while wandering in mountains and forests,
they are slaughtered by bandits,
pushed from cliffs,
or ravaged by malevolent spirits and demons.
Or they perish in fires, floods,
or by the blades of weapons.
Thus, those who slight this **sutra** meet untimely deaths,
reaping such fruits.

How can one not grieve?
How can one not lament?
Therefore, I declare to you:
Follow this teaching faithfully,
and do not harbor evil thoughts.
If no evil thoughts arise,
all entanglements cease,
and the **sand-like evil karmas** dissolve with the mind.
All calamities and demons vanish naturally.
The virtue of this is beyond measure—
a **supreme, matchless, wondrous **Dharma**,
the **King of all **sutras**,
with great benefit.
Do not reveal this to the **unworthy**.

If mortals refrain from evil thoughts,
cutting off all karmic ties,
this is the **Great Beneficial Path**.

If **celestial beings** in their **Five Decays** and **Four Signs of Decline**,
facing the encroachment of **reincarnation**,
can abandon delusion,
uphold this **sutra**,
and recite it naturally,
their **celestial blessings** grow ever stronger,
their bodies transcend the **Three Realms**,
and they abide eternally with the **Dao**.

This **scripture** is unmatched,
unequaled,
possessing **great virtue and power**,
a **great divine spell**—
it can make withered things sprout leaves and fruit,
remove the heaviest sufferings of beings,
and grant longevity to those with short lives.
Its virtues are beyond comprehension,
beyond all praise.

If one has not sown the **seeds of the Dao** in past lives,
or cultivated vast **meritorious deeds**,
they may not even hear its name,
let alone encounter this **sutra**.
According to the **Three Caverns’ True Principles**,
it is transmitted only once every **eighty thousand eons**.

This **pure and exalted scripture** is treasured
in the **Celestial Capital’s Golden Gates and Imperial Palace**,
exceedingly subtle and rare—
only those with **inherent Daoist essence**,
destined to become **Nine-Heaven True Immortals**,
may encounter this text.
Through this fateful connection,
they shall later offer **gold and jewels**
to their **盟师 (盟师—*méngshī*, "pledge-master" or "covenant teacher")**
and receive it,
only then may they ride the **celestial timing** to pass it on.
Do not reveal it lightly—
revere it and guard it carefully.

I humbly declare:
I have heard in the **scriptures** that
*"To truly observe the **Dharma Realm’s nature**,
all things are shaped by the mind."*

This teaching, if proclaimed aloud,
is said to shatter the hells’ *gāthā*[1].
Thus it is known:
when the mind arises, the hells arise;
when the mind is extinguished, the hells are extinguished.
The arising and ceasing of the mind,
the existence and nonexistence of the hells—
how much more so when the mind does not merely arise
but further gives rise to evil!

Therefore, in the *Chánjīng Bàoyìng Pǐn*[2],
it is stated that the common mortal’s transgressions
are boundless and limitless.
If one can but briefly extinguish the evil mind,
then all crimes and karmic burdens
shall be utterly exhausted,
leaving no trace behind.
Yet to harbor even a single evil thought,
its calamities and sufferings
are beyond measure—
what need for words to describe them?

Thus it is known that within the four-square inches of the heart,
lies the pivot of gain and harm,
the root of ascent and descent—
how can one dare to be negligent,
how can one dare to fear it not?

Further below in the *pǐn*[3],
it is recorded that all heavenly beings and mortals,
should they encounter the five decayed or four afflicted states,
if they abandon delusion and false thought,
then their celestial blessings shall be ever more secure.
False thought is but the mind’s arising.

Though mortals and heavenly beings differ vastly,
yet ascent and descent, gain and harm,
all hinge upon the single mind.
Alas, can the mind truly be left unchecked?
Can the mind truly be left in darkness?

If all beings cannot yet prevent the mind from arising,
then they should at least refrain from giving rise to evil,
abandon false thought,
so that all notions cease,
all entanglements subside—
perhaps then the dust-like evil deeds
shall dissolve with the mind,
and they may become virtuous folk.
The worthy scholar’s return lies here:
this text is their unshamed refuge.

The destruction of calamity-demons,
the protection of all life,
the reach of the Emperor’s grace—
these shall follow like shadow to form.

If one further expands and fulfills this,
making the mind like the boundless void,
pure and flawless within and without,
accepting all without exclusion,
embracing all without rejection,
and directly attaining the **True One’s Unobstructed Dao Gate**,
the **High Path of Pure Liberation**—
then the station of the **Twelve Heavenly Worthies**,
the fruit of the **Jade Sovereign’s Three Bodies**[4],
shall not be difficult to reach.

All beings should strive earnestly.
I, your subject, speak with utmost sincerity.

Then the **True One** (天尊) solemnly expounded this meaning and spoke in verse:

If the waters of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers
Could spawn lotuses from their waves,
If a loving crow’s feathers turned white,
Such wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.

If tortoises bore hair,
Fit for weaving into robes,
If moonlight at night could melt ice,
Such wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.

If gnats and mosquitoes had feet,
Capable of building bridges and boats,
And bore all burdens heavy,
Such wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.

If a fledgling bird could carry great mountains,
And cast them into distant realms,
Such wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.

If a single-leaf boat held strength
To bear the Kunlun peaks,
And float across the vast sea,
Such wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.

If leeches could sprout colossal fangs,
As large as elephant tusks,
Such wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.

If the leaves of broom and hemp
Could shelter the boundless **Jade Sovereign’s** (无鞅) domain,
And shade the **Jade Sovereign’s** countless multitudes,
Such wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.

If crows and kites of the same kind
Shared one nest in a single tree,
And fed each other in mutual trust,
Such wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.

If rabbits sprouted horns,
Fit for use as ladders and stairs,
And reached the **Highest Heaven** (有顶天),
Such wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.

If shrews and rats climbed
The rabbit’s horned ladder,
And devoured the moon in the sky,
Such wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.

If a donkey’s lips were as red
As the **Bodhi fruit** (苹婆果),
And it could sing and dance with grace,
Such wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.

If flies and insects drank
From cups of **Jade Stone wine** (钟石酒),
And drowned in intoxication,
Such wonders would still be rare as scripture’s truth.

At that time, having finished expounding these verses,
The **True One** universally declared to the **Four Assemblies** (四众):

Those who uphold this scripture
Are called the **Meritorious Body** (功德身),
For all sentient beings
Are sheltered by its grace.

Those who uphold this scripture
Are called the **Divine Power Body** (神通身),
For all auspicious blessings
Shall gather unto them.

Those who uphold this scripture
Are called the **Pure Body** (清净身),
For all defilements and evil deeds
Shall never touch them.

Those who uphold this scripture
Are called the **Mighty Virtue Body** (威德身),
For celestial demons and heterodox paths
Shall never ensnare them.

Those who uphold this scripture
Are called the **Peerless Body** (无等身),
For the **Supreme Deities** (上帝) shall summon them afar,
And all spirits shall bow in reverence.

Those who uphold this scripture
Are called the **Unshakable Body** (坚固身),
For even in the **Great Calamity** (恶劫) of woe,
They shall remain unharmed.

Those who uphold this scripture
Are called the **Dao Treasury Body** (道藏身),
For their words, once spoken,
Shall be obeyed by spirits and gods.

Those who uphold this scripture
Are called the **Compassionate Body** (慈悲身),
For all beings in the **Six Realms** (六道)
Depend upon its benevolence.

Those who uphold this scripture
Are called the **Great Dao Body** (大道身),
For wherever they go,
No fear shall bind them.

Those who uphold this scripture
Are called the **Skilled Physician Body** (良医身),
For their wondrous and efficacious methods
Shall bring comfort and ease to all.

Those who uphold this scripture
Are called the **Radiant Body** (光明身),
For they shall forever be the Emperor’s light,
Illuminating all who receive them.

Those who uphold this scripture
Are called the **Omnipotent Body** (自在身),
For they shall traverse the **Celestial Palaces** (天宫) and **Mystic Realms** (妙境),
And spirits shall guide them.

The merits of those who uphold this scripture
Are beyond measure to recount.

Your humble subject, having received the imperial command to verify the scripture,
Dares to cite these verses,
Thus selecting and compiling its profound truths
Within the sacred text.

Though the scripture’s **modifications and verifications** (修证) of **fruit and station** (果位) have not always aligned with the **Three Revelations** (准经文之示三) of the original,
I have nonetheless transmitted them.

The *Chapter on Retribution* (报应品) records the **True One’s** words:
The **Heavenly Abodes** (天府) attained by those who uphold the scripture
Are now enumerated as the **True One’s station** (真人之位).
For instance, the **Meritorious Body** (功德身)
Is the station of the **Meritorious True One** (功德真人).

All beings who earnestly devote themselves to this scripture,
Reciting and upholding it without retreat,
Shall directly attain these **True One’s stations**.

Now, the **Four Heavenly Selectors** (四天选举司) have seen those ascending to these stations.

All beings should steadfastly resolve their thoughts,
Recite with their mouths and hold in their hearts,
Lest they violate any precepts,
And thus align with the **Jade Sovereign’s Voice** (如玉音),
Seeking to ascend and verify this chapter.
Then the **Nine Clans** (九族) shall receive blessings,
And the **Seven Mystic Classes** (七玄) shall undergo refinement,
Not only shall this body be free from calamity and gain fortune.

Hold fast in reverence without slackening,
And gather at the **Jade Flower Assembly** (瑶华).
Your lowly subject earnestly prays,
Hoping you will not doubt or be confused.

Your humble servant speaks with utmost reverence:

Moreover, if a Daoist adept or devout practitioner, having established the ritual platform and recited this scripture, dons fresh and pure garments, and in the dead of night, abides alone in a serene and spotless chamber, strikes his teeth nine times, faces east, and sits upright, reciting and chanting this scripture—then at that moment, the **Supreme True One** (太真) presides at the desk, the **Jade Consort** (玉妃) sweeps the banquet, ten thousand spirits array themselves in ranks, all the heavens descend upon the platform, the Three Realms stand guard, the Five Emperors oversee the welcome, and thereafter, with eyes closed and mind still, they focus their thoughts upon this scripture. Unbeknownst to them, they find themselves within the Five Clouds, and soon their body radiates a brilliant light, ascending to the Celestial Palace, where the **Immortal Worthies** descend to greet them. Whatever their heart desires is granted, and they may freely take elixirs and treasures of the Dao. Thus, one must follow the ritual method, close their heart to distractions, and uphold this scripture. Even the **Three-World Golden Immortals** and **Ten-Direction Great Saints** all depend upon this scripture for their practices, thereby attaining the **Supreme Wondrous Dao** in an instant.

This is the **Celestial Sovereign**—the **Teacher of All Heavens** and the **King of All Saints**. Therefore, even the common mortal who encounters this scripture shall receive the Five Emperors’ patronage, summoning spirits and immortals, commanding celestial officials, regulating yin and yang, earning the reverence of myriad spirits, and subduing ten thousand deities. Malevolent forces flee in terror, and all demons are bound in form. After death, they shall ascend to the **Southern Palace** for refinement, tread the **Flying Steps to Upper Purity**, and wander freely in eternal Dao.

Furthermore, even if a worldly being has merely heard of this scripture and harbors constant longing, they may, within their home, select a pure place, draw the **Celestial Sovereign’s** likeness, and with utmost devotion, morning and evening, offer incense, flowers, lamps, and fruits in reverent worship, invoking the name and paying homage. Such a person shall attain **thirty kinds of supreme wondrous virtues**:
1. Praise from all immortals,
2. Ascension to heaven for the deceased,
3. Liberation from past calamities,
4. Smooth passage wherever they go,
5. Freedom from theft and robbery,
6. All desires fulfilled,
7. Protection from water and fire disasters,
8. Concealment from all misfortune,
9. Auspicious dreams at night,
10. No sickness afflicting them,
11. Wisdom and keen intelligence,
12. Universal joy upon meeting others,
13. Abundant clothing and food,
14. Honorable descendants,
15. Joy from relatives,
16. Harmony within the clan,
17. Escape from the three evil retributions,
18. Transformation from female to male,
19. Noble and dignified appearance,
20. Appointment as a great minister of the realm,
21. Birth as an emperor,
22. Reverence from ghosts and spirits,
23. Knowledge of past lives,
24. Protection by all deities,
25. Blessings upon the Nine Clans,
26. Longevity in this world,
27. Dependence of all sentient beings upon their virtue,
28. The **Demon King’s** protection and welcome,
29. Transcendence of the Three Realms,
30. Ascension in broad daylight.

At that time, the **Celestial Worthy** further declared to the Four Assemblies: *"The virtues of this scripture can shatter iron-clad mountains, drain the waters of the Sea of Suffering, break the Great Hell, uproot profound sins, subdue violent demon kings, protect all lands, extinguish all malevolent ghosts, cure all grave illnesses, dissolve all poisons, sever ties with all wicked beings, subdue all venomous beasts, and crush all heretical paths. All the heavens shall bow in submission. Its remaining virtues are too vast to enumerate."*

When the **Dao Assembly**, **Golden Immortals**, **Bodhisattvas of Truth**, and the **Consorts of the Saints** heard these words, they rejoiced, leapt for joy, bowed in reverence, and composed this hymn:

*"Great is the Supreme Dao, without equal among the Highest True Ones.
Above, it transcends all heavens; below, it rescues the lost souls.
Above, it has no teachers or ancestors—only the Dao as its body.
In the **Dan Platform** and **Purple Bureaus**, the **Golden Gates** and **Jade Capitals**,
This wondrous law is kept in secret, bestowing boundless blessings upon all sentient life.
It annihilates my ten thousand sins, extending my years of life.
Ten thousand spirits pay homage, the Demon King welcomes me in protection.
Its virtues flourish eternally, inscribed in the **Yellow Register**.
Through countless eons, it grants me eternal existence."*

Thus, the assembly finished their hymn, bowed in homage, and withdrew with reverence. Your humble servant speaks: *"None is more august than the heavens, yet **Mahāraja Heaven** is the heaven of heavens; none is more noble than the emperors, yet the **Jade Emperor of the Supreme** is the emperor of emperors."* Therefore, the **Celestial Worthy** declared: *"This is the Emperor—Teacher of All Heavens, King of All Saints."*

Since this Emperor occupies the most exalted and noble position, unmatched and unconquerable, those who harbor reverence shall attain virtues without equal. Those who harbor disdain shall incur retributions without equal. The **thirty kinds of supreme wondrous virtues** are but the **Celestial Worthy’s** summary; the full account of sins and retributions is detailed within the chapter itself—a mere outline spoken by the **Celestial Worthy**.

If beings seek fortune and encounter this scripture, they should ponder it thrice. Reflect upon its beginning and end, its words and meanings, storing its essence in their minds. Strive to recite and uphold it diligently for three years, accumulating boundless merit.

Having received the edict to collate this scripture, your humble servant respectfully petitions to establish a dedicated bureau to record the merits accumulated by those who copy, recite, and uphold the *Jade Emperor’s Biographies and Scriptures*, demonstrating divine retribution. The Emperor’s benevolence shall surely grant this request.

This is the conclusion of the scripture—let all beings take heed.

Your humble servant speaks with utmost reverence.
**The Complete Scriptures of the Jade Emperor’s Biographies and Deeds, Volume Complete.**
*(End of the white-text edition. The phrase "Dongxuan Lingbao" is absent in the original.)*
*(Note 1: Original text had "症" for "疽," corrected here.)*
*(Note 2: Original had "庄严" for "果报," an error; corrected to "fruit of retribution.")*

Now according the white-text edition’s corrections.

#4 *"Daozhong"* (道种), in the white-text as *"Daoben"* (道本) — this is correct.
#5 The white-text edition omits the phrase *"this scripture"* (此经).
#6 *"From the盟师 received"* (从盟师受之), in the white-text as *"From the师告盟 received"* (从师告盟受之) — this is correct.
#7 *"Pu"* (溥), in the white-text as *"Pu"* (普).
#8 *"Huiwen"* (会闻), in the white-text as *"Zengwen"* (曾闻) — this is correct.
#9 *"Li"* (离), originally *"Mie"* (灭) — corrected here according to the white-text edition.

---

Your servant, having received the imperial decree, has now diligently collated *The Complete Scriptures of the Jade Emperor’s Biographies and Deeds* (高上玉皇本行集经), respectfully awaiting the completion of the petition to present the corrected text.

Your servant hears that:
To found a doctrine for the world, one must forsake the highest wisdom—how could it be otherwise?
To edit the *Shijing* (诗经) and establish the classics, only the Sage could suffice.

For the canons are the measure by which the people are guided, and the glosses are the footpaths of refined discourse.
If even a single character is not carefully scrutinized, it may lead to error for ten thousand generations.

Thus, to record without embellishment was prized by the ancient sages;
And to express without distortion was never the failing of the great scholars.

This trust is not lightly bestowed, nor is the responsibility easily assumed.
The *Complete Scriptures of the Jade Emperor’s Biographies and Deeds* (高上玉皇本行集经) are secretly transmitted through the golden mouth, their profound truths enshrined in the palace of jade. Even the lower immortals struggle to hear them, and in this turbid age, few can glimpse their brilliance.

Its mystical meanings penetrate the depths of the Stygian Sea,
Its true principles tower above the lofty Kunlun Mountains.
Each word reveals the path of liberation,
Each phrase kindles the breath of purity.

To praise them is to exhaust one’s breath—
Yet how could one ever fully comprehend their profundity?
If one encounters the passage of time too long,
Or transmits the text with careless errors,
Even the faintest mist may obscure the sun and moon,
And a minor flaw may mar the splendor of jade and pearls.

Who would have thought that the Sage’s benevolent wisdom,
Though vast, would still wish to preserve the scripture’s every virtue?

Thus, Your servant receives this gracious edict,
And, though unworthy, dares to accept this noble charge.
With trembling hands and humble heart,
I dare not presume to match the thoroughness of a meticulous weaver’s thread,
Nor fully expound the mysteries of the Dao—
Yet I strive to avoid excessive elaboration, lest it weary the reader,
Or invite doubt when discerning its deeper meaning.

Other revisions remain incomplete.
Your servant now respectfully presents this corrected transcription,
Praying for Your mercy and review.
If there be even the slightest benefit to the text,
May I be granted the honor of Your scripture’s promulgation.

Or, may Your servant humbly request that the relevant bureau be commanded
To further examine and expound its essential meanings,
Lest this work be scorned as a *San Chuan* (三传) scattering the *Chunqiu* (春秋),
Or criticized like one without the Nine Masters’ insight into the *Yijing* (易) Dao.

Your servant, with sincerity like flayed flesh and exposed vitals,
Dares to besmirch the divine ear’s favor,
And implores Your mercy for this presumptuous act,
That I may continue in my lowly duty.
I swear with the fidelity of metal and stone,
To repay Your boundless grace with utmost devotion.

Your servant’s emotions are beyond expression—
Gazing heavenward, awaiting the Sage’s judgment,
Shaken with reverence and trembling with fear,
I bow in submission, awaiting punishment.

Respectfully submitted in a memorial,
Awaiting Your imperial decree.

Year, Month, Day:
Your servant, Liang,
Memorial.

**Imperial Response:**

*"Your detailed petition and the corrected scripture have been received.
Your virtue is pure and harmonious, your literary brilliance radiant—
Your careful deliberation and diligent verification
Have not only corrected falsehoods to reveal the truth,
But also uncovered profound meanings within the text.

Moreover, your heart is warm and sincere,
Thus your words are clear and refined.
Your discernment is keen, your labor thorough—
It is fitting that this scripture be stored in the Inner Hall of Jade Sovereignty,
And proclaimed to all the heavens,

Further, command the Southern Continent and all other realms
To propagate this teaching among the multitude of true ones,
And let none dare to treat it with disrespect.

Additionally, Your servant is bestowed with
The Nine-Lighted Precious Seal and the Eight-Scenic Treasure Chariot,
As tokens of Your esteemed recognition of his merits—
Accept them with reverence, in accordance with this favor.

Thus, this response is given,
So that Your servant may be fully aware."*

Month, Day:
Issued.

「Lin Shaohua received [the teaching], and the Venerable Master praised him.

Reciting the sutra yields profound resonance—
its efficacy is attested within the scripture itself.
From the ancient times of the Sui and Tang Dynasties onward,
historical accounts and present-day realities alike
have been fully recorded in the hidden treasures [of the scripture].
Herein, a few additional events are briefly noted,
appended to the end of this volume,
to demonstrate the sutra’s unimaginable **virtue/power** [不可思议].

**Chen Wang’s sudden awakening**—
a man of Kuaiji during the Sui era.
He passed the imperial examinations and entered the **Golden Gate Assembly** [金门集],
was appointed as a **Longcheng prefect** [长城尉] after his robes were first unfurled.
Since his youth, he recited this sutra,
and whenever he faced calamity,
he often received aid [from it].
During the reign of Kaiyuan,
while traveling east from Kuaiji River to Dongyang,
a great storm arose.
With twenty-odd vessels setting sail together,
they unfurled their sails against the wind,
but soon, the sky darkened,
and the gales grew ever fiercer.
At the **Boundary Stone Gorge** [界石窦], the waves surged and shattered the bows of the twenty-odd ships,
reducing them to ruin.
In dire straits, he fervently invoked this sutra,
and suddenly in the current appeared a form—
like a crimson **dragon** [赤龙],
stretching forth to steady his vessel,
thus enabling him to reach the shore.
All were saved by the **power** [力] of reciting this sutra.

The **Yin Mountain Elder** [银山老人]—
a native of Raozhou.
The silver-mining households where he dwelled numbered over ten thousand,
all living in thatched huts.
During the reign of Yanhua,
a celestial fire erupted,
burning all the huts—
yet his residence remained untouched.
The local governor then inquired of the elder:
“What skill or method do you possess?”
The elder replied:
“I have long devoted myself to the **Dao/Way** [道],
and daily recite this sutra without fail.”
**Mou Rong Wen Yuan**—
a man of the Sui era.

Month, Day:
Issued.

When the sick man had been dead for seven days,
and they were about to wrap his body,
suddenly one foot shrank,
and he revived.

He said, *"I was pursued by a man into a city,
where a king asked me: 'In life, what virtue/power did you possess?'
I answered: 'My poor family had no means to cultivate virtue/power,
only to recite the *Jade Emperor Sutra* [玉皇经] with a single-minded heart.*
The king praised this and said: 'Would you like to hear this sutra?'
So he invited me to ascend the hall,
set up a golden couch,
and commanded me to recite the sutra.
Suddenly, a jade maiden [玉女] appeared,
wearing a crown of crimson phoenix feathers [翠凤冠],
clad in garments of purple mist [紫霞衣],
and pointing to the *Jade Emperor Sutra* [玉皇经] I had recited,
she knelt before me,
ordered me to recite it clearly and distinctly,
and when I finished,
she vanished without trace.
As I left the gate,
only the pursuing officials remained,
leading me up a high mountain.
There, the city walls rose steep and grand,
smoke and fire reached the heavens,
dark qi [黑气] coiled upon the earth,
and the cries of the mournful were unbearable.
I struck my head and begged to depart,
and the official then guided me back home.
I saw my body lying in bed,
with the ghostly officials pushing it from behind,
and I revived again in darkness.*

**Dou De Xuan** [窦德玄]
During the **Ling De** reign [麟德中],
serving as an envoy,
passing through Yangzhou,
crossing the Huai River by boat,
I saw a man in a pitiful state,
leading a small child,
sitting upon the ground.
I said: *"It’s late, and no other boats will come—
why not travel together?"*
At midstream,
I saw the man’s face was gaunt with hunger,
so I fed him
and helped him reach the shore.
I mounted my horse,
and after ten li [十里],
asked: *"Where do you intend to go?"*
He replied: *"I am not human—
I am the ghostly envoy of the Eastern Peak [东岳],
going to Yangzhou to pursue the great envoy Dou De Xuan."*
I was startled and fearful,
dismounted my horse,
and bowed in reverence: *"I am the one you seek."*
Tears streaming,
I begged for a plan,
and the ghost was deeply ashamed:
*"You spared me and fed me in my dire straits—
how could I repay you?
Recite the *Jade Emperor Sutra* [玉皇经] one hundred times,
and I will come to reward you."*
I said: *"I lack the original text."*
The ghostly envoy replied:
*"The Daoist priest Yin Si Xuan [尹嗣玄] of Lingzhou’s Spirit Immortal Temple [钵洲灵仙观] has the authentic copy—
go and urgently request it to recite."*
With that, he vanished.

I then returned,
sent someone to seek the sutra,
and without pause,
day and night,
I recited a hundred copies.
One day, as I slept,
I dreamed the ghostly envoy had come to call me,
leading me to a city’s palace gates.
He said: *"Wait here—
I will inform the king."*
The envoy entered,
and from outside,
I heard the king’s fury:
*"Why have you leaked my affairs,
and devised plans for another?"*
He ordered his attendants to drive and execute the envoy.
The envoy emerged,
stripped to show his wounds,
and said: *"This is for your sake."*
He was led inside,
and the king asked:
*"You possess great virtue/power—
your fate has not been fully exhausted.
Your human life is complete,
and you shall be reborn in the heavenly realm.*
He summoned the envoy to escort me back.
I asked the envoy:
*"What rank shall I attain in the future?"*
He answered:
*"From now on,
you may ascend to the Palace Attendant [殿中监],
and by sixty-four,
you shall reach the Left Chancellor [左相].*
With that, he departed,
and upon waking,
I found it had come to pass as he said.*

**Si Ma Qiao Qing** [司马乔卿]
A native of Hebei [河内] during the Tang.
In the **Yong Hui** reign [永徽间],
he served as the Yangzhou Household Officer [扬州户曹],
and upon his mother’s death,
he built a hut and copied the sutra.
Beside the hut grew a fungus [芝草],
with green stems and crimson caps [朱盖],
dripping juice each day—
one升 [升],
and its taste was sweet.
When the copying was complete,
my mother spoke from her seat:
*"By your filial devotion in reciting this sutra,
I have been granted rebirth in heaven."*

**Li Xiu** [李修]
During the **Xian Qing** reign [显庆中] of the Tang,
upon his father’s death,
he vowed to copy this sutra in three parts
to repay his labor.
As soon as one part was finished,
a five-colored circular light [五色圆光] of qi filled the brush.
When the copying was complete,
the brush was unharmed.
Often, I heard strange fragrances at my seat,
and flowers would fall.
Later, the brush tip was lost.
After half a year,
one night I saw golden light upon the ground,
and when I pointed it out,
it shone toward the lost brush tip,
its radiance undiminished.
The virtue/power of this sutra,
felt through sincere filial piety,
elevated my father to a higher realm.

**Lü Wen Zhan** [吕文展]

**Tang Kaiyuan** reign [开元三年], he was appointed to **Lan Prefecture** [阆州]. Devoted to the **Dao** [道], he recited this sutra ten thousand times [诵此经万卷]. As he grew old and his teeth fell out [年衰牙落], he earnestly prayed to the sutra, and his teeth regrew as before [向经恳请，牙复生如旧].

During a time of severe drought [时亢旱], the prefectural magistrate ordered him to pray for rain [刺史令祈雨]. After reciting the sutra once [诵经一徧], he immediately received abundant rain [随获霈然]. When there was prolonged flooding [又苦霖潦], the deputy magistrate again ordered him to pray for clear skies [别驾复令祈晴], and the weather cleared [立霁].

One night, while reciting this sutra, he saw the inside of his house illuminated as bright as day [又一夜诵此经，见屋内光明若昼]. Several **kings** [王者] appeared, along with a multitude of **celestial beings** [诸仙众], all kneeling and joining their palms in reverence, bowing and praising its merit [长跪合掌，礼拜称善].

**Wen Zhan** [文展] was greatly startled, descended from his seat, and returned the bow, saying: *"Wen Zhan has no Dao/Way* [道法], yet to receive such profound respect from the **sages and worthies** [圣贤], his guilt is deserving of ten thousand deaths* [罪当万死]." The kings replied: *"We are all **demonic kings of the heavens** [天人魔王], just now ascending to the celestial realms [适向诸天]. We saw this mortal world illuminated by a radiant light, so we followed the luminous transformation and descended in person. We cherish it and depart* [故寻光化身下降，云珍重而去]."*
