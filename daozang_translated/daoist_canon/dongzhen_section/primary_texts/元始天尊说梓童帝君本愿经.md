**Chapter of the Numinous Treasure: Dispelling Kalpic Disasters, Rectifying the Mind, and Initiating Transformation (Superior Grade)**

At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was in the Golden Palace of the Clear and Subtle Heaven, convening with the Heavenly Lords and the assembly of boundless sagely hosts. Ascending the Jeweled Throne of Jade Splendor, he emitted a radiant light that illumined all worlds. Gazing upon the multitudes of beings who had encountered kalpic tribulations and endured boundless suffering—tossed and turned in the dusty realm, revolving through the cycles of birth and death—he sighed deeply and said: *"Alas for the people! Alas for the people! Who has brought this upon them?"*

Then a perfected one named Compassionate Salvation arose from his seat, stepped beyond the ranks, and prostrated himself before the Celestial Worthy, saying: *"This humble servant, unworthy of virtue, has by the grace of the Dao’s shelter escaped such suffering. Yesterday, I witnessed the August Emperor of Jade reviewing the registers and determining the kalpic destiny. He commanded the Dark Marshal of the Northern Yin, the Many-Eyed Primal Calamity, and the hosts of demon kings to descend and patrol the mortal realm, stirring up warfare, spreading pestilence, and slaughtering countless living beings, so that none among the people might be spared.*

*Now, beholding the multitudes—fathers and sons, brothers, husbands and wives, men and women—whose brains and viscera are splattered upon the earth, who wail and weep in sorrow, unable to protect one another, and further afflicted by great celestial disasters, with ghosts appearing even in broad daylight—even those who escape one calamity cannot evade another. I wonder: since time immemorial, what transgressions have these beings committed in their cultivation and karmic deeds to deserve such retribution? How can this not be grievous? How can this not be agonizing?"*

May Your boundless compassion reveal what we have yet to awaken to.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "These multitudes, from kalpas past, have shown no reverence for the Three Treasures, no filial piety to parents, indulged in lust and greed, deceit and envy, and malice. They have committed every manner of transgression, their sins waxing daily, accumulating month by month. Thus has the Jade Emperor decreed the turning of kalpic destiny to transform the world. Though their suffering is grievous and agonizing, it is but the harvest of their own sowing."

Thereupon, the Merciful and Salvific Perfected One, together with the assembled host of sages, each prostrated and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "We have pondered this deeply, and our hearts cannot endure it. With furrowed brows and knitted brows, we are powerless to save them. We beseech Your celestial grace to arouse compassion, open the path of expedient means, and extend a golden arm to rescue those engulfed in flames and drowning waters, that the human realm may not face extinction. We dare, at the risk of death, to humbly present this plea."

Then the Heavenly Worthy, resting a hand upon the table, sat in solemn silence for a long while before responding: "Recently, in Shu, there has been a great deity named Zitong, who serves as an aide to the August Heaven, equal in dignity to the Great Unity. His station is exalted at the Southern Culmen, his virtue pervades the ten directions. He governs the revolutions of the Primal Chaos, oversees the laurel-bestowed emoluments of officialdom, examines the records of the Six Registers, and gathers the forms of the Five Peaks. Through billions of kalpas, he has manifested over ninety transformations, ever mindful of the living, expending his utmost care. Thus has the Jade Emperor entrusted him with a *ruyi* scepter and commissioned him to ride the flying simurgh, enlightening the mortal realm and revealing his traces throughout the world. For this final kalpic tribulation cannot yet be eradicated; if one seeks to dispel it, this deity is the one. I shall summon him for you, that he may deliver and save the world in its final age, preventing its extinction."

At that moment, the Merciful and Salvific Perfected One and the assembled host of celestial sages bowed again in reverence, expressed their gratitude, and returned to their places.

Then the Heavenly Worthy commanded the banner-bearing jade maidens to face the realm of Unbridled Joy and sound the celestial summons thrice. Suddenly, the Imperial Lord Zitong, enveloped in clouds of five-colored *qi*, arrived from the northwest. With dignified and graceful steps, he advanced, prostrated himself, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "On this auspicious day, this dharma assembly is convened. I, absorbed in my transformative labors, have delayed our reunion. I humbly beseech Your celestial compassion to grant me pardon."

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "Humanity receives life at the center of Heaven and Earth, transformed within the interplay of yin and yang, shaped by the Five Phases, and formed by the union of the Two Qi. Yet they know not the rarity of obtaining a human body, the difficulty of being born in a land of bliss. Instead, they indulge in greed and deceit without restraint, until the kalpic destiny unfolds, and warfare erupts, pestilence spreads, fires rage, and floods surge—all of their own making.

Now, the assembled Imperial Lords and the boundless host of sages in Heaven and Earth have all petitioned me, wishing to dispel this kalpic tribulation. Thus, I entrust this task to you. Strive with diligence."

Thereupon, the Imperial Lord Zitong bowed in gratitude, received the decree, and prepared to withdraw. The Heavenly Worthy addressed him again: "Imperial Son, this final kalpic tribulation is vast in its karmic reckoning. By what means will you dispel it?"

The Imperial Lord Zitong prostrated himself once more, advanced, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "From kalpa to kalpa, I have been a body of myriad flames, exiled to the land of Shu. With trepidation and awe, I have feared failing in my duty. Only now, in my earnest reflection on past transgressions, have I realized my error before Your celestial grace. In my humble consideration, to dispel this kalpic tribulation, one must first rectify the human heart.

For those who are children, instruct them in filial piety; for those who are subjects, instruct them in loyalty. Instruct brothers in fraternal harmony, husbands and wives in concord. Instruct those in high station to treat their subordinates with compassion, and those who govern affairs to act with impartiality."

"If you lead the people to practice this consistently, perhaps the calamity may be slightly averted."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy cast a sidelong glance and, with an expression of profound admiration, exclaimed: "How extraordinary! The Imperial Lord, moved by compassion for sentient beings, has expounded these causes and conditions, awakening the heart to enlightenment. If all people in the world persist in putting these teachings into practice, they may dispel kalpic tribulations, bring prosperity to the nation, grant long life to its people, allow all things to fulfill their nature, ensure abundant harvests of the five grains, and fill the roads with songs of joy. Should they act contrary to these principles, however, wars, plagues, and pestilences will follow one upon another, corpses will lie strewn across the fields, bones will pile into mountains, and humanity will perish entirely. Take heed and strive!"

Then the Imperial Lord Zitong bowed in gratitude, embraced the qi of five-colored clouds and mist, and withdrew toward the northwest.

At that time, the Perfected One of Compassionate Salvation, having heard these words, rejoiced with exultation and, still seated, offered a hymn of praise:

"Alas for you, sentient beings,
Deceitful, greedy, and wrathful!
Day by day your turmoil grows,
Restless, heedless of restraint.
Thus you bring upon yourselves the tribulations of the final age,
And humankind nears the brink of ruin.
Then the Primordial Honored One,
Moved by compassion for all beings,
Resolved to save them from the suffering of the final kalpa,
And so commanded the Lord of Zitong.
In his brush, the threefold samadhi unfolds,
Orderly, he first rectifies the heart.
Guiding those lost in the dust,
Fortune and blessings converge in full.
When the Perfected One of Compassionate Salvation had finished this hymn, the four assemblies rejoiced as one, exclaiming in unison that they had never heard the like.

**Middle Grade of the *Lingbao Scripture on Dispelling Kalpas and Rectifying the Heart with Numinous Response***

The Dao spoke: The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, seated upon the Jade Flower Throne, gathered in his radiance, composed his spirit in silent meditation. The luster of jade ornaments shone brightly, enveloping true qi. Bells and drums resounded in unison, divine winds harmonized, and the subtle intent of the Dao was as gentle as spring. All the Golden Immortals, the four assemblies, the eight divisions, banners, pennants, and jeweled canopies stood in attendance.

At that time, the Heavenly Lord Yuan Zai Kong Sheng, the Perfected One who Delivers from Suffering and Lifts Sins, and the Lord of the Eastern Peak each rose from their seats, knelt before the Dao, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "By what cultivation in past kalpas have we been privileged to attend this Dharma assembly and personally receive your sacred teachings? Our hearts are filled with joy and gratitude. Yet, though we are dull and ignorant, and though we rejoice upon hearing this scripture, we have not fully grasped its meaning. We humbly suggest that if the human heart is not rectified, it will incur these kalpic tribulations. Had the Heavenly Worthy not extended your great golden arm, radiated your great illumination, and displayed your great divine power—commanding the deities who patrol the world to resume their rightful places—then perhaps other methods might seem less urgent. Now that the great kalpa has arrived, and the fate of the age is vast and perilous, while the Nine Heavens open to transform and rectify the human heart, we fear that this may be too slow. We implore your heavenly compassion to enlighten us on what we have yet to understand."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy let out a long sigh and addressed the assembly of perfected beings: "Alas! Have you still not grasped the root of this principle? When a person is born, the seed of goodness is innate within them. Filial piety and fraternal duty are deeply rooted; the four beginnings are fully present; the five phases shape their nature; loyalty and trust are inherent; harmony and deference are transmitted. Such is the nature of humanity—unlike the grasses, trees, birds, and beasts. All who bear the semblance of human form share this in common. Yet as the world declines and human hearts grow distant from antiquity, cunning, deceit, greed, jealousy, cruelty, and chaos arise in endless varieties, eagerly pursued.

Thus, they show no reverence for the Three Treasures, no courtesy before the Three Luminaries. They curse the wind and rain, blame heaven and resent the earth. They treat their parents as strangers, regard their siblings as enemies. They scrutinize others’ faults while excusing their own. When they see another’s goodness, they conceal it; if another falls short, they slander them, stopping at nothing. When they see another’s evil, they delight in it, emulate it, and fear they cannot surpass it. The wealthy grow arrogant, indulgent, and dissolute, scorning the worthy, disrespecting teachers and elders, strutting with heads held high, treating the poor as if they were treading on grass and weeds. They neither cultivate virtue nor perform hidden acts of merit. They waste the gifts of heaven, ensnare profit in the marketplace, never knowing restraint. The poor, meanwhile, flatter and covet, blame ghosts and gods, unaware of past-life karma, unable to endure poverty with integrity. They engage in illicit sex, theft, and transgressions, violating propriety and overstepping bounds, never repenting.

Thus, evil people fill the world, malevolent spirits roam freely, slander and treachery flourish, and venomous calumnies abound. Governance falters, the people suffer, mountains and rivers cry out in exhaustion, ghosts and spirits grow restless. Grievances accumulate, rising to assail the heavens. When the world reaches this state, how can it not transform? Thus, the celestial registers are examined, the cycles of fate complete. This great kalpa arrives: the sun and moon grow dim, yin and yang fall into discord, demonic spirits patrol the world, rebellious people rise in succession, wars, plagues, and pestilences follow without cease. Though one may escape for a time, one cannot avoid it forever. Bones pile into mountains, blood flows like water, humankind is annihilated, leaving no descendants. To save them—how could this be easy?

Therefore, I commanded the Imperial Lord Zitong to transform the Nine Heavens, to dispatch the Flying Phoenix to save the world, that all people might purify their hearts and cleanse their thoughts, all attaining the good Dao. Let children be filial to their parents, subjects loyal to their rulers, brothers harmonious and respectful, husbands and wives harmonious and compliant. Let those in high station treat their subordinates with compassion, and those who govern affairs act with impartiality. Let them be free of greed and jealousy, deceit and falsehood. If they practice this without cease, transforming the world, then ghosts and spirits will revere them, heaven and earth will be at peace. The elderly may attain long life, the young may be nurtured, the land may know tranquility, the five grains may ripen abundantly, and the final age may return to antiquity. How then could the kalpic tribulation alone remain undispelled?

Though I might extend my radiance and lower my arm to save them, if the human heart remains unrectified, how could this endure? Thus, it is better that the human heart be rectified, and the great kalpa will naturally dissolve. Then the deities who patrol the world will revere and fear, not daring to unleash their poison. You must each listen with focused reverence and cast aside all other concerns."

Then Yuan Zai, Kong Sheng, the Heavenly Lord of Salvation from Sinking and Deliverance from Sin, the True Man, and the Lord of the Eastern Peak of Mount Tai all rejoiced, made obeisance, and silently returned to their places.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy again addressed the four assemblies, saying: "I shall now further expound the causes and conditions. You must each listen with focused reverence. Humans are the most spiritually endowed of all beings, and the heart is the master of the body. Abiding in profound stillness, free from transgression and desire, untainted by deceit, without anxiety or thought—when speech arises from this, it is gentle, kind, and yielding; when action arises from this, it is upright and straight. In relation to parents, one does not strive for filial piety yet is naturally filial; in relation to rulers, one does not strive for loyalty yet is naturally loyal; in relation to siblings, one does not strive for fraternal respect yet is naturally respectful; in relation to spouses, one does not strive for harmony yet is naturally harmonious. One does not impose heavy demands on others nor pursue things for private gain, but follows one’s nature in all conduct, which invariably accords with the Dao. What room is there for contrivance?

Thus, the land is clear and at peace, the people are secure and prosperous, and the age resembles high antiquity. In this final age, if ordinary people diligently uphold these principles without omission or deviation, with unwavering resolve and unceasing mindfulness, the blessings they receive will be no different. How then could the great kalpa persist in not dissolving?"

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke this verse:

Wondrous is that single point,
Undisturbed, unagitated.
Without thought, without anxiety,
Utterly wise, utterly clear.
Heavenly principle shines forth,
The root of good nature is established.
Once tainted by deceit,
The five constituents collapse.
Naturally returning to rectitude,
A hundred blessings converge.
Revere this, be cautious of this—
Let all the assembly listen closely.

When the Heavenly Worthy had finished speaking the verse, the hosts of celestial perfected beings, innumerable immortals, and the deities of mountains and rivers leapt for joy, marveling at what they had never before encountered.

At that time, the True Man of Preserving Harmony and Responsive Transformation prostrated before the Dao and said: "We have not yet learned what merits this sutra possesses beyond dispelling the kalpa. We humbly beseech the Heavenly Compassion to broadly expound its benefits for the Four Assemblies, the Lord Śakra, the deities of heaven, the spirits of mountains and rivers, all beings between heaven and earth, and all future sentient beings."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the True Man of Preserving Harmony and Responsive Transformation, saying: "Excellent! If kings, emperors, regents, and great ministers uphold this sutra, extend its teachings, practice it without fail, and transform the world through instruction, then naturally customs will become pure and mores will thicken, governance will be virtuous and the people will be at peace, the five grains will ripen abundantly, and all things will flourish.

If ordinary people, in times of leisure, wholeheartedly and with deep reflection diligently recite this sutra, then naturally their parents will enjoy longevity, their descendants will attain honor and nobility, their households will prosper, their bodies will be healthy, and whatever they seek will be fulfilled in every way.

If someone enters mountains or forests, or ventures upon rivers and seas, and encounters fierce winds or venomous beasts, as long as they repent and hold this sutra in mind, then naturally mountain spirits will guard them, river lords will support them, fierce beasts will retreat, and winds and waves will instantly subside.

If someone is in military ranks or encounters enemies, as long as they repent and hold this sutra in mind, then naturally malevolent people will be pacified, deadly weapons will not befall them, and they will remain unharmed, secure as usual.

If a woman faces the peril of childbirth or seeks offspring, as long as she repents and holds this sutra in mind, then naturally she will be safe and at peace, bearing blessed sons and daughters who are intelligent, wise, and held in esteem.

If someone recites this sutra in temples of various deities, those spirits will escape the ghostly realm and increase their heavenly blessings.

Moreover, if Daoist adepts, virtuous men, or faithful women prepare a quiet chamber, don fresh garments, paint images of the Nine Heavens’ sovereign lords, and offer incense, flowers, lamps, fruits, and pure water in worship—purifying their thoughts, sitting upright with focused minds, and reciting this sutra—then all the ghosts and spirits in their presence who hear it will depart the ghostly realm and attain the fruits of immortality. All hungry ghosts who hear it will escape the suffering of hunger and thirst and be received into the Southern Palace. All animals who hear it will escape the suffering of their condition and return to the human realm. All plants that receive the influence of this sutra will be revived if withered and grow even more luxuriantly. All beings—whether flying, swimming, moving, or growing; born from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation—all sentient beings will attain the transformation of the Dao.

Furthermore, wherever this sutra resides, and wherever the person who upholds it may be, there will always be the flying celestial sages of the ten directions, the True Men of Salvation from Suffering, vajra warriors, divine immortals, celestial soldiers and horses, golden essence beasts, and innumerable hosts who will constantly come to protect them. The merits are beyond enumeration."

Thereupon, the True Man of Preserving Harmony and Responsive Transformation bowed his head and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "The merits of this sutra have now been heard by all. If some people in the world harbor doubts, do not believe, recklessly slander, place it carelessly without a clean altar, or recite it without purifying themselves through fasting, what retribution will such offenders incur? We humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to further enlighten us."

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy said: "Alas! Why do you ask such a question? The merits of this sutra are immeasurable, and its karmic retributions are likewise beyond full description. If people respectfully uphold and follow it, their doubts and slanders will each incur corresponding rewards or punishments of varying degrees. If I were to expound on this at length, those of perverse views might become even more doubtful. My purpose in speaking this sutra is solely to save the people of this final age. Whether they believe or doubt, they will naturally experience the consequences for their lives and fortunes—how could this be made known to every household?"

"Let it be wished that all in the world who serve their parents do so with heartfelt filial piety, not merely with outward show; those who serve their lords do so with heartfelt loyalty, not merely with outward pretense. In dealing with brothers, let there be heartfelt friendship and respect, not mere surface cordiality. In the bond of husband and wife, let there be heartfelt harmony and compliance, not mere outward accord. In treating subordinates, let there be no pretense of deep affection while the heart remains indifferent; in handling affairs, let there be no outward display of perfect impartiality while the heart remains biased.

If one can follow this Dao, then even those who doubt or slander will come to believe. If one cannot uphold this Dao, then even those who fast, maintain reverence, and recite the sutra will remain unbelievers. The good accumulate goodness, the wicked accumulate wickedness; when these accumulations have endured long enough, Heaven and Earth, the gods and spirits, examine and weigh them. Disaster or blessing follows naturally—what need have I to speak of it?

Thereupon, the Perfected One of Preserving Harmony and Transformation, along with the assembled host of celestial immortals, joined their voices in praise and recited these verses:

Great indeed is the boundless Jade Star within,
Its depth surpassing even the river’s source.
Though countless lives are slain in sacrifice,
Bowing to the Supreme One defies all speech.

Then the Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion,
Opened the Nine Heavens to universally dispel all ills.
He taught only that the mind-ground remain ever pure,
Whether in doubt or faith, all beings shall be exhausted.

Now I bow my head and take leave of the Venerable One,
That myriad myriad living beings may not perish in deceit.

When the Perfected One of Preserving Harmony and Transformation and the assembled immortals had finished reciting these verses, they bowed before the Heavenly Countenance, made their obeisance, and withdrew, receiving and upholding the teachings.

When the sutra recitation was complete, they purified their hearts, knelt in reverence, and performed the preliminary repentance:

Seven-Curved Merciful Venerable True Teaching Master,
Merciful Father and Mother who gave me life.
Children born of the sacred are all filial and kind,
Grandchildren who follow the divine are all compassionate and dutiful.
A family’s harmonious qi knows no end,
For ten thousand generations, the spring terrace shines with moonlight.
Merciful light illumines all celestial beings,
Subtly permeating every mote of dust, filling Heaven and Earth.
My life shares the same body as Heaven and Earth,
Just as Wenchang was at the beginning of the kalpa.
The sacred is not sacred of itself, nor the profane profane—
Only now, after drifting through kalpas, do I awaken.
I vow to follow the teachings of the Seven-Curved Merciful Venerable,
To be loyal, filial, and compassionate in heart.
Not with speech to slight gods or men,
Not with deeds to burden father or mother,
Not with intent to deceive Heaven and Earth,
Not with the mind to bring misfortune upon descendants.
I vow to practice filial conduct and hidden merits,
To perform all manner of virtuous deeds and expedient means.
I repent all the karmic stains of past lives,
And take refuge in the great merciful light of the Seven-Curved One.
I seek descendants, emolument, and the way of life—
Not from others, but from myself.
Only my teacher, Wenchang of the Seven Curves,
Has waited through kalpas for beings, upholding the law of forbearance.
I pray that a single wish-fulfilling light be released,
To compassionately regard all beings’ true repentance.

When the repentance was complete, they proceeded to make vows:

For parents, may they together attain the fruit of longevity,
With tortoise years and crane hair, illumined by merciful light.
For myself, may I bow to great auspiciousness,
Honoring superiors and nurturing inferiors without distress.
For descendants, may they inhale the osmanthus of Cloud Cliff,
That they may flourish together with their children and grandchildren.
With father’s kindness and child’s filial piety, a family’s spring,
Bright and unburdened by the Merciful Venerable’s teachings.
May I be personally received by the Seven-Curved One,
Guided to ascend to the true and enter the sacred gate.
Abandoning life and receiving life, with perfect knowledge,
May all be fulfilled through endless future kalpas.

When the vows were complete, they proceeded to offer praise:

In the Osmanthus-Fragrant Hall, the Lord of Compassion,
Whose teachings flow everywhere, washing away karmic roots.
Karmic roots transformed into the fragrance of osmanthus,
The root of goodness cultivated into the fruit of longevity.
A family’s flesh and blood without affliction,
The Seven-Curved One’s descendants all protected.
May all, from this life to the next,
Before the Purple Cloud Cliff, ever attain the Dao.
Step by step, heart by heart, at the Emperor’s side,
Life after life, the heavens decree.
Though bones may turn to dust and form to ash,
A single point of true heart remains like metal and stone.

When the rites were concluded, they made offerings and prayers as they wished, and performed the dedication of merit.

Thus concludes *The Sutra of the Original Vows of Lord Wenchang of the Seven Curves*, spoken by the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning."
