**The Supreme Vast Boundless Primordial Perfected Wenchang Great Cavern Immortal Scripture, Scroll One**

**Preface by the Celestial Worthy of the Nine Heavens’ Transformative Governance, Clarity and True Contemplation, Treasure Radiance, Compassionate Response, and Eternal Life**

Collated by the Supreme Mystery and Unsurpassed Highest Virtue Perfected Lord, Master of Moyi Cave of Ganshan

I once lived as a farmer, and while tilling the fields, I unearthed a golden statue beneath my hoe. Upon inquiring with the village elders, I was told it was an image of the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning. Long ago, when Yu the Great governed the waters, he smelted metal to fashion this statue to pacify the sacred peaks. I had worshipped it with incense and offerings without the slightest negligence. Yet when a sea storm churned the waves beyond human strength to withstand, I, on behalf of the people, cast the golden statue into the raging waters. Thereupon, the winds and tides receded, and the entire region found peace.

I had long pondered this event when one evening, a radiance stretched across the sky above the sandy shoals. Digging there, I recovered the original statue and returned it to build a temple for its enshrinement. The people of the region joined me in its veneration, and over the years, its numinous responses became too numerous to record.

My parents, alas, perished in a pestilence. I built a hut beside their graves, tending the earth around them. Then, three divine beings—Perfected Zhen Dingguang, Yu Luoqiao, and Guang Miaoyin—appeared before me, clad in hempen headscarves, feathered robes, and straw sandals. They bestowed upon me a volume of the *Great Cavern Scripture*, saying: "Recite this morning and evening, and you shall surely attain good fruits. Among the Three Powers, above, it may aid the souls of your parents and ancestors, liberating them from dark suffering; in the middle, it may eradicate sins, dispel calamities, prolong life, and augment blessings; below, it may protect your clan and save others, ensuring their preservation. You may offer gold and silk to us three, and we shall memorialize your devotion."

That very day, I followed their command, preparing a vegetarian feast and presenting gold and silks to receive their teachings. Thereafter, I recited the scripture morning and night without cease, and its numinous responses were manifold. Once, during a scorching summer, a great flood submerged my parents’ graves. I reverently presented the golden statue and recited the *Great Cavern Scripture*, vowing to complete a thousand recitations to ensure their safety. The following autumn, incessant rains swelled the streams into a single torrent, and my fear grew. Yet when the waters receded, I saw that the valley before the graves had transformed into a vast, solid plain, over a *li* in breadth. From then on, the pines and catalpas remained unharmed.

I had long grieved that my parents died of pestilence, hating the plague demons with a bone-deep enmity. Though the paths of the living and the dead diverge, I lacked the power to exact vengeance. Thus, I diligently recited the *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture* morning and evening, entreating the golden statue with utmost sincerity, praying for the might to subdue the plague demons.

Three years later, I suddenly dreamed that the golden statue spoke to me: "You have mastered the *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture*, but you have not yet seen the *Great Cavern Register of Methods*. Today, I shall bestow it upon you to quell demonic forces. This will not only fulfill your original vow but also aid Heaven’s transformative work, assisting the state and saving the people." From its sleeve, it produced two texts, which I received with a hundred bows. The first was the *Great Cavern Register*, and the second, the *Great Cavern Methods*.

Upon waking, I found the two books at my pillow. I prepared a vegetarian feast, placed them in a sacred casket, and chose an auspicious day to examine them. As I read the passage, *"When the ten thousand armored soldiers of the Great Cavern Heaven descend to deliver..."*, suddenly, wind and thunder darkened the day. Countless figures in golden armor and crimson sashes arrayed themselves before me, bowing to receive my command. One holding a red banner stood at their fore, saying, "We await your orders."

Still in a daze, I unthinkingly shouted: "I command you to subdue the plague demons! In this village, an entire household lies stricken—go and drive them out!" At once, the banner-bearer led over a hundred soldiers into the house. In an instant, they emerged, dragging five demonic agents. Some wore tiger skins, some wore rooster crowns, some resembled humans, others crows or donkeys and horses. All wielded tools of water, fire, feathers, and chisels.

Enraged, I rebuked them, threatening to annihilate their forms. They pleaded: "We disciples arise from the yearly cycles, formed by the *qi* of the seasons. We roam in fixed directions, afflicting those destined to suffer. Those punished by dark judgments endure calamity; those whose heavenly mandate is severed meet death. This is not our private doing. It begins with the Three Officials and Five Peaks, who memorialize the Jade Emperor, presenting the sins of mortals. Thereupon, the Emperor commands the Three Officials and Five Peaks to spread illness. The Year Star’s register assigns our tasks, and we act strictly according to the ledger. If the Perfected Master grants us leniency, we shall henceforth obey restraints. Wherever we encounter the talismans and registers of the Perfected Master, we shall not dare to approach."

I then instructed them according to the scripture’s methods, and they departed. Thereafter, whenever villagers fell ill with pestilence, I provided them with talismans and methods, and all were saved. Through these registers and methods, I rescued countless afflicted souls. My name spread far and wide, and scholars, commoners, officials, and clerics flocked to my door seeking healing, their numbers beyond count.

I accumulated profound merit and wondrous deeds, all through reciting the *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture* and obtaining the *Great Cavern Register of Methods*. Thus, I could fully manifest divine efficacy, rectify the proper, expel the perverse, deliver the living, ferry the dead, dispel calamities, and prolong life.

Later, in unseen realms, mighty ghosts and spirits, as well as the valiant souls of local shrines, came to request that I recite the scripture for their benefit. They expressed their gratitude, saying: "By the power of the Perfected Master’s scripture, our virtue and might have increased, and our names have been inscribed in the registers of good spirits."

Should lost souls and lingering spirits unable to attain rebirth appear—manifesting in dreams or possessing forms to beseech me for scripture-recitation and merit-transference—they would all express their gratitude, saying: "By the power of this scripture, we have escaped the苦趣 and all obtained rebirth."

When seasonal epidemics spread unchecked, one need only recite this scripture and perform the register rites, dispatching the *Plague-Dispelling Talisman*, *Plague-Cutting Talisman*, *Plague-Stilling Talisman*, and summoning the celestial couriers and armored legions to command the Nine Divisions of officials: the *Plague-Seizing, Plague-Consuming Officers*; *Toxin-Seizing, Toxin-Consuming Officers*; *Evil-Seizing, Evil-Consuming Officers*; *Qi-Seizing, Qi-Consuming Officers*; *Ghost-Seizing, Ghost-Consuming Officers*; *Calamity-Seizing, Calamity-Consuming Officers*; *Essence-Seizing, Essence-Consuming Officers*; *Divine Physician Officers for Healing*; and *Talisman-Wielding, Shrine-Destroying Officers*. Each division leads its armored troops, joined by the five hundred million black-clad cavalry of the Northern Celestial Officials, the Venerable Canglao, the Venerable Magu, and the Diamond Vajra Warriors, to apprehend the malevolent forces.

First, a memorial is sent to the Year Sovereign, then a petition to Mount Tai, before delegating authority to the City Gods and Earth Deities, who dispatch the Epidemic Envoys. If the perverse resist the rectification and refuse to disperse, or violate the covenant upon hearing the scripture, they are then reported and annihilated.

The Great Dao cherishes compassion; the Supreme Clarity ever embodies goodness. The Celestial Emperor delights in life and extends benevolence to halt killing. Those who practice the scripture and register rites must not act with private harshness, lest they incur heavenly censure. One should dispatch them with propriety, honor them with scripture, awe them with register rites, and exhort them with virtuous deeds—this is the swift path of expedient cultivation.

Practitioners of this scripture and register rites must exercise careful discernment to establish profound merit. This scripture is revered and mighty, capable of resolving karmic entanglements, settling tomb disputes, halting heavenly retributions, dissolving curses, lifting offenses, pacifying graves and dwellings, calming military and government affairs, stilling warfare, ending epidemics, praying for wind and rain, summoning auspicious omens, ensuring silkworm and grain harvests, protecting life and body, shielding clans, aiding the state, securing borders, restraining insects and tigers, averting droughts and floods, vanquishing demons, quelling myriad evils, pacifying the spirits of sacrificial rites, aiding the souls of ancestors, and delivering lost and lingering spirits. All these may be accomplished by holding fasts, reciting scriptures, and performing the Dao.

For treating illnesses and neutralizing poisons, there is the *Divine Prescription of the Purple Court Heavenly Physician*—a remnant grace of the Golden Empress of Yu the August, extending to all generations, sparing people from untimely deaths and freeing them from the scourge of epidemics. Those who uphold this teaching should seek out and study it to attain immortal merit.

In a former life in Wu and Kuaiji, through the merit of this scripture, I attained the rank of Brahmā-Conquering Tathāgata. Thereafter, through unwavering recitation, I realized the fruition of Supreme Clarity’s *Imperial Sovereign of Unbounded Joy and Nurturing Heaven*, the *Venerable Perfected of Luminous Purity and Merciful Response, Eternal Life of Rebirth*. By diligent recitation of the scripture, I ascended to the nobility of the Upper Clarity—how could one not deeply revere and transmit it?

Those who receive and recite it must strive to practice it, aspiring to ascend together with the assembly of Wenchang in the cultivation of wondrous deeds.

*Revealed in the autumn of the wùzǐ year of the Qián Dào era at the Phoenix Terrace, received by Liú Ānshèng. Re-revealed in the autumn of the jiǎzǐ year of the Jǐngdìng era, re-collated at the Biē Tóu Mountain’s Mó Wéi Cave, with the Golden Lotus Stone serving as the ritual altar, received by Luó Yìzǐ. Thereafter, on the ninth day of the ninth month in the yǐchǒu year of the Xuánmò era, again revealed at the Xīlíng Guìyán Wèishēng Zǒngzhēn Altar:*

The *Scripture of Salvation* and the *Great Cavern Scripture* are the ancestors of all scriptures; the Pearl of Millet and the Treasure of Cānghú are the sources of all sages. These two scriptures, though bearing different names, share a single origin—giving birth to heaven and establishing earth, gestating the mysterious and dividing the primordial. They are no deceptive words to delude the world, but the essential means to enter sageliness and generate spirit. They govern creation and turn the pivot of the cosmos. Their words lack ornate rhyme, their verses eschew florid embellishment—thus they are profound and abstruse, difficult to fathom in detail. They are treasures cherished by the heavens above.

From the Boundless to the present, how could they be allowed to fall into neglect? Yet people today know only to recite the *Scripture of Salvation* and remain unaware of the *Great Cavern Scripture*. For the *Scripture of Salvation*, I once composed verses to embellish its meaning, but the *Great Cavern Scripture* has lacked such adornment. Now, I command the attendant disciples to carve woodblocks and disseminate it, and I shall also compose hymns to illuminate its virtue, that readers may more easily understand and reciters more readily awaken.

**Preface to the Scripture’s Meaning**
From the primordial tones of Cānghú’s burning sand,
Sealed in celestial script to ferry heaven’s kin.
The Great Mysterious Dao’s father sought its transmission,
And only then did the *Great Cavern Scripture* descend to the world.

**Cultivating the True Dao**
Mortals of the vast earth seek to awaken the truth,
Yet the path to immortality is distant and hard to find.
If you wish for a swift and unerring way,
Recite and hold the *Great Cavern Scripture* in heart and mouth.

**Praying for Offspring and Prosperity**
The virtue of past ancestors was slight,
And this life’s prosperity and descendants are fraught with hardship.
If you wish your prayers to align with your desires,
How can it compare to diligently studying the *Great Cavern Scripture*?

**Averting Heavenly Disasters**
Sun and moon lose their light, suffering eclipse,
Stars stray from their courses, disrupting celestial patterns.
To dispel heavenly calamities and bring peace to the common folk,
Let the worthy recite the *Great Cavern Scripture* together.

**Praying for Wind, Rain, and Bountiful Harvests**
Drought demons bring disaster, rain falls like gold,
Locusts and floods leave no grain to harvest.
To ensure universal abundance and no famine,
Prayers rely entirely on the *Great Cavern Scripture*.

**Transforming the Common Folk**
Artisans, merchants, farmers, and all four classes,
Greedily pursue gain, unaware of the karma they carry.
Amidst busyness, carve out a moment of leisure,
And study the *Great Cavern Scripture* of Wenchang.

**Pacifying Treasury and Halting Warfare**
Treasuries overflow with wealth and resources,
Weapons forever stilled in joyful peace.
The people sing of the Dao’s governance, seeking lasting order—
Repay the nation by diligently studying the *Great Cavern Scripture*.

**Pacifying Ghosts and Spirits**
Earth deities, shrine spirits, and all numinous beings,
Seek promotion yet lack the means.
To ascend the registers of good spirits and augment their power,
They must listen to the *Great Cavern Scripture* day and night.

**Aiding Ancestral Spirits**
The souls of kin—parents and ancestors—
Linger long in the underworld, unable to ascend.
If you wish to deliver them but lack the means,
Fast and diligently study the *Great Cavern Scripture*.

**Resolving Tomb Disputes**
Tomb disputes and summonses burden descendants,
Coupled with heavenly retributions in the celestial court.
For generations, misfortunes are passed down—
To resolve them, one should study the *Great Cavern Scripture*.

**Resolving Offenses Against Graves and Dwellings**
Whether renovating homes or constructing graves,
Breaking ground offends the inauspicious spirits.
This brings misfortunes upon the household—
To resolve and pacify them, hold fast to the *Great Cavern Scripture*.

**Dispelling Pestilence**
When the Year-Star governs the Five Pestilences,
Plagues spread through towns and villages, harming the people.
To protect neighborhoods from contagion,
Maintain strict purity and study the *Great Cavern Scripture* together.

**Curing Illness**
When monthly afflictions and yearly calamities linger in the body,
One seeks physicians, divination, and gods in vain.
With no means of relief and nowhere to turn,
Entrust your fate to the Dao and take refuge in the *Great Cavern Scripture*.

**Delivering Sunken Souls and Stagnant Spirits**
The six kinds of karmic souls—men and women—
Dwell in darkness, bound to the shadowy underworld.
To universally proclaim their deliverance to the celestial realms,
Frequently study the *Great Cavern Scripture*.

**Untangling Karmic Grievances**
The six paths of karmic foes weave deep entanglements,
Vengeance upon vengeance—when will it end?
To bring joy to each and all,
There is nothing but listening to the *Great Cavern Scripture*.

**Ending Curses**
Whether over wealth or wrath,
A moment’s fury invokes the gods.
When ghostly lawsuits form, when will they cease?
Only the *Great Cavern Scripture* can dissolve them.

**Quelling Calamities**
Illness, death, and misfortune cling to the body,
Official disasters and bandits bring bitter oppression.
Wealth scatters like melting ice—
For protection, hold fast to the *Great Cavern Scripture*.

**Eradicating Demonic Beings**
Spirits of trees, stones, foxes, monkeys, and dogs,
Hurl bricks, set fires, and take human form.
They wield power, demand lewd sacrifices—
To exterminate them, study the *Great Cavern Scripture*.

**Opening the Mind and Sharpening Wisdom**
Scholars and students with minds choked by weeds,
Child prodigies who falter in response—
To wield the brush with divine aid,
First cultivate the habit of holding the *Great Cavern Scripture*.

**Preserving Form and Life**
This body is like illusion, like a bubble,
Yet within its qi and spirit lies the path to true cultivation.
To preserve form and life, aligning with Heaven,
Diligently ponder the *Great Cavern Scripture* of Wenchang.

**Admonishing the Wealthy**
Do not rely on vast wealth amassed at home,
For Heaven’s decree can strip your fortune and topple your prosperity.
When the time is ripe to cultivate merit,
Sacrifice your wealth to print and distribute the *Great Cavern Scripture*.

**Accounts of Efficacy**
With a heart of sincerity reaching the Supreme Clarity,
One receives transmission from the Three Spirits.
This body attains the fruit of Heavenly Worthies—
All because of diligent study of the *Great Cavern Scripture*.

**Two Universal Exhortations**
Hear my earnest words on the *Great Cavern Scripture*,
Its profound mysteries truly beyond naming.
Its boundless merits defy thought—
I urge all mortals not to take it lightly.

The Primordial Heavenly King expounded the Great Vehicle,
Only those with karmic affinity encounter this sacred scripture.
If one can study and recite it steadfastly to the end,
They shall join the assembly of Wenchang.

**Qinghe Elder’s Eulogy on Essential Teachings**
The Three Caverns’ scriptures treasure jade-like sounds,
Their words resplendent, scattered like pearls and gold.
They avert disasters, ward off misfortunes, and birth heaven and earth,
Delivering all beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges.

The Great Dao unfurls, weaving the Cavern’s text,
Its aid to people and benefit to creatures boundless.
If mortal beings wish to become soaring immortals,
For my sake, purify your heart and read this wondrous chapter.

The Dao is fundamentally soundless—how could it have words?
Yet the sages established teachings to forcefully transmit it.
To catch fish, one must rely on the power of the trap;
Once the fish is caught, what need remains for the trap?

When the Primordial One first transmitted the *Great Cavern Scripture*,
Its single sound resounded for all to hear.
The lamp of Dharma was passed on by later generations—
Not only by Heavenly Worthies and Dao Lords.

When the divine wind is still and the sea cloudless,
Heaven and earth are serene, the four qi pure.
If even one karmic thread stirs in delusion,
The celestial pivot turns once more without cease.

On auspicious days and favorable hours, recite the scripture well,
Let not worldly cares entangle the mind.
When the work of aiding people and benefiting creatures is complete,
Your name shall be inscribed on jade tablets and golden registers.

Neither existent nor nonexistent, originally pure,
Beyond form, beyond sound, transcending all comparison.
Where depiction and description fail to reach,
The subtle image within the Mystery is most distinct.

The highest true beings, devoid of qi,
Have endured from the Dragon Han era to the present.
Unchanging, unaugmented, they are quiescence itself—
This is called the Great Dharma Body.

Contemplate the talismanic decree—it proclaims itself,
Able to release those bound in dark prisons of suffering.
Returning to the origin, restoring the primordial, it revives life,
So that all may ascend at every moment.

Impurities arise from the mind’s obscurity,
The three paths and five sufferings burden form and soul.
When the light of Heaven washes away the roots and dust,
Immortal transformation dawns as one bows to the Supreme.

Gradually entering non-action, attaining the Dao’s essence,
Not a speck of dust clings, the mind is perfectly attuned.
Glancing back at the three thousand realms below,
All dharmas dissolve into emptiness.

The Great Dharma Body, formless and traceless,
Neither born nor destroyed, is called the Perfected True One.
Though countless kalpas of stone wear away,
Its tranquil divine radiance remains ever bright.

After traversing the arduous roads of life’s passes,
This time, joy comes with one’s name on the golden tablet.
Who can restrain the aspirations of a true man?
Returning in glory, one rides freely like a team of four horses.

To study the Dao, rely on abundant wisdom,
Lest the clear river swell with wind and waves.
Melt the heart and enter beyond the cinnabar clouds—
What can the spears and halberds of the world do to me?

**Preface to the *Scripture of Transformative Enlightenment from the Nine Heavens***
Composed by the Perfected Lord of Merit-Gathering at the Northern Bureau

This scripture was proclaimed by the Golden Mouth of the Most High,
Solely to save beings in the final kalpa.
Upon concluding the discourse, it was entrusted by jade decree
To be stored in the Jade Palace’s inner sanctum.

A command was issued to all heavens to propagate its teachings,
And all Perfected Ones to transmit it accordingly.
Thus, it was transmitted and descended to eight altars,
Yet only Shaoxi’s numinous response saw it gathered and printed,
While others merely copied and recited it.

The people of Dingzhou excel in goodness beyond other prefectures,
And the transformative enlightenment of the Great Emperor is most profound in this land.
My own incense offerings have continued for over a decade,
Unmixed and unwavering from beginning to end.
Only Wenchang’s numinous response has been particularly commendable here, descending to transmit it.

Moreover, I urge the faithful to carve blocks and print it for distribution—
Now, fortunately, the task is complete.

Alas!

All who appear in the green registers and receive this scripture—are they not those who seek life and wish to escape the sufferings of war, plague, and pestilence? Yet I say: merely receiving the scripture is not enough; one must recite it to be sufficient. And even reciting it is not enough; one must practice it to be complete.

What is practice? It is filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, obedience, impartiality, and forbearance. These are not difficult—they are merely the three words: *abide in one’s proper place*. Such are my words. They can dispel the kalpa’s tribulations. Whether you doubt or believe, what have I to do with it?

**Rites for Recitation**
When reciting the scripture, one must fast and bathe, don fresh and pure garments, enter the chamber, light incense, knock the teeth nine times, and bow in the heart to the Nine Heavens. Visualize the Primordial Heavenly King of the Origin and the host of exalted Perfected Ones, the Seven-Curved Great Emperor of Transformative Enlightenment, and the immortal officials descending to the dharma assembly, all arrayed in the void. Only then recite the incantations.

**Incantation for Purifying Heart and Mouth**
Spirits of the cinnabar pearl mouth, expel filth and disperse miasma.
Spirit of the tongue, rectify order, connect life and nourish the spirit.
Spirits of the thousand teeth, repel evil and guard the true.
Spirit of the throat, fierce as a tiger, extend *qi* and draw forth essence.
Spirit of the heart, cinnabar origin, let me commune with the true.
Contemplate the spirit, refine the fluid—may the Dao’s *qi* endure forever.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

**Incantation for Purifying the Body**
Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, pacify and comfort this bodily form.
Disciples’ souls and spirits, five viscera in profound darkness,
Azure Dragon and White Tiger, arrayed in splendid ranks,
Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior, attend and guard my true self.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

**Incantation for Purifying the Three Karmas**
Within this body’s inner realms, thirty-six thousand beings dwell.
In movement, action, concealment, and retreat—through kalpas past and future—
May this body ever abide in freedom, ever dwell within the Three Treasures.
When the kalpa collapses, may this body never perish.
As this incantation is recited, may the three karmas be wholly purified.

**Incantation for Dispelling Filth**
Essence of the Great One, blossom of the Well Star,
Flowing to bathe the body at noon, sweeping filth and expelling evil at dusk.
Pure as a luminous pearl, immaculate as a lotus blossom,
Transform into a body of golden light, step upon clouds of brocade and rosy dawn,
Ascend the seven-jeweled hall, become a true immortal.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Nine Heavens’ Transformative Sovereign, the Primordial August Emperor commands!

**Incantation for Purifying Heaven and Earth**
Heaven and Earth in primordial chaos, foul *qi* disperses like petals.
Within the cavernous void, radiance illumines the Great Origin.
The Three Clarities’ jade decrees, light shines upon the nine thoroughfares.
Mighty spirits of the eight directions, let me be as nature intends.
Numinous Treasure talismanic command, proclaimed throughout the Nine Heavens.
*Gan luo da na*, penetrating the stellar pivot of the Great Mystery,
Sever demons, bind evil, slay ten thousand ghosts.
Incantation of Mount Zhong, jade script of the Origin.
Recite once to repel ghosts and prolong life,
Pressing forth to the Five Peaks, known to the Eight Seas.
Demon kings bow their heads, attending my chariot.
Malevolence and filth swept clean—may the Dao’s *qi* ever abide.

**Incantation for Purifying the Altar**
When the Most High preached the Dharma, golden bells chimed five notes.
All filth hid in the ninefold earth; demon hordes guarded the *qian* grove.
Heavenly flowers scattered as Dharma rain; Dharma drums shook the deluded from slumber.
All heavens rejoiced—how excellent! Golden youths strummed jade zithers.
May the eight rosy dawns’ radiance pour forth, illuminating my heart of refuge.
Swiftly ascend the great Dharma bridge, soaring to the depths of the five clouds.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

**Incantation for Pacifying the Local Deity**
The Origin establishes and pacifies, proclaiming to the ten thousand spirits.
True officials of mountains and rivers, numinous deities of the land,
Altars to the left, millet to the right—let none dare recklessly disturb.
Turn toward the true Dao, within and without made solemn and pure.
Each abides in its proper place, guarding the imperial court in readiness.
The Most High has decreed: hunt down and capture demonic essences.
Dharma-protecting divine kings, safeguard the recitation of scriptures.
Take refuge in the Great Dao—*yuan*, *heng*, *li*, *zhen*.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

**Incantation of the Five Stars**
The Five Stars array their radiance, shining brilliantly in the five directions.
Water engenders and averts disaster; Wood’s virtue brings prosperity.
Mars dissolves calamities; Venus repels warfare.
Saturn stabilizes the four quarters—household and state flourish and prosper.
Names inscribed on jade tablets, characters recorded in the imperial chamber,
Riding the whirlwind, fanning the light, soaring through the great void,
Emerging and entering the unseen, roaming and feasting in the ten directions.
Five-colored clouds float as canopies, summoning spirits and commanding winds,
Commanding the ten thousand spirits, above to protect the immortal elders.

**Opening the Brazier**
Most High True Lord of the Three Heavens’ Primordial Origin, Three *Qi* of the Great Shang, Lord Lao, summon forth the thirty-six officers of the Three and Five Merit Officials within our bodies, the left and right attending envoys, the incense-bearing dragon-riding couriers, the incense-attending Golden Youths, the message-transmitting and flower-scattering Jade Maidens, the Five Thearchs’ direct talismans and daily incense officials—thirty-six each, emerge!

Silently visualize them emerging in solemn attire, opening the gates. Here, on this land’s true officials’ domain, where we burn incense and recite scriptures, Golden Youths waft smoke, numinous consorts scatter flowers, and the true sages of the Three Realms gather before our chariot.

We humbly pray: after reciting this scripture, may true *qi* circulate throughout,
Above, to protect and preserve the ancestral altars, pacify and serve the emperor, dispel disasters of war, water, and fire, and eliminate plagues of pestilence, drought, and locusts;
In the middle, to extend longevity, protect and bless the entire household, dissolve the nine stars’ and eight difficulties’ misfortunes, and free them from the burdens of the five sufferings and three calamities;
Below, to inscribe names in the black ledgers, release them from the ghostly realm, ascend the seven ancestors to immortality, and enable the deceased to attain the Dao.

Next, we pray for the people of different surnames: may they ride the scripture’s Dharma to flourish in ten thousand blessings; for the creatures of mountains and marshes: may they feel the sagely merit and all transcend to the Dao’s shore. May we be spared from illness and calamity, our thoughts ever turned to the true and the Dao, our minds cleansed and hearts stilled, aspiring to ascend lightly. Aiding others and benefiting all beings, establishing merit as the foremost task—whatever we pray for, may it swiftly be granted, known throughout heaven above and earth below.

May the life-*qi* of the Most High’s Ten Directions’ true and upright ones descend, flowing into our bodies, so that our entreaties swiftly reach the boundless Great Dao’s Three Clarities, the August Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven, the Divine Literary Martial Filial Virtuous Loyal Benevolent King of Zitong, and the Great Merciful Savior of the Kalpa, the Ever-Living Heavenly Worthy of Renewed Life before the throne.

**Incantation for Gathering Spirits**

The Primordial Origin’s Great Perfection, the Five Thunder’s Lofty Venerables.
The Grand Hua’s radiant brilliance illumines the Eight Gates with penetrating clarity.
The Five Elders proclaim their mandate—no hidden realm remains unheard.
Above, they govern the Nine Heavens; at the center, they command Mount Feng;
Below, they pacify rivers and seas, the twelve water sources.
The Eight Mighty Spirit Incantations, the numinous talismans of jade script,
Summon dragons to bring rain, gather *qi* and condense mist.
Sun, moon, and the five stars; the Northern Dipper’s seven origins.
The Luminous Celestial Thearch unites them, decreeing the descent of the Supreme Mystery,
Proclaiming might through the Three Realms—none dare delay.
All heavens, all earths, all waters, all mountains,
The jade perfected ones’ legions, the vast and profound great spirits,
The Transcendent Kings at their feasts, the great marshals bearing banners,
Heavenly soldiers clearing the way before them, golden tigers charging behind,
Fierce beasts of the Jue Heaven arrayed, guarding the four gates.
What is called arrives instantly; what is summoned appears at once.
The vermilion writs blaze forth, wind and fire unceasing.
Registers are seized in response to command, golden horses speed the transmission.

Here ends the first scroll of *The Supreme Mystery’s Comprehensive Perfection of Wenchang’s Great Cavern Scripture of the Dao*.
Here begins the second scroll of *The Supreme Mystery’s Comprehensive Perfection of Wenchang’s Great Cavern Scripture of the Dao*.

Gan Mountain’s Mowei Cave Master, the Supreme and Unsurpassed Highest Virtue Perfected Lord of the Great Mystery, having collated and rectified, now offers incense.

We bow in reverence, as auspicious winds and nurturing rains gather the numinous essence of the Five Fragrances; as boundless virtue and perfect benevolence witness the sincerity of a single wisp. This may traverse the boundless, called the smoke that is no smoke. Relying on this misty qi, we universally extend our offerings—one mind in utmost reverence, ten thousand spirits gazing from afar.

May the golden key be opened, and the jade scriptures be exalted. We pray that sacred radiance be dispersed, that Brahma’s voice resound clearly; that the dead receive rebirth, that the living attain deliverance; that no wish go unfulfilled. All beneath Heaven’s canopy, all upon Earth’s embrace—those with karmic affinity shall all realize enlightenment.

We now raise our invocation in verse:

Each awakens the utmost sincere heart,
Wishing to enter Wenchang’s Assembly of Fortune and Lineage.
We take refuge in the Three Treasures and all patriarchs,
Hoping only for compassion’s constant embrace.

We look up to the Three Clarities’ realm,
To the supreme lords of the Three Realms.
The Primordial Beginning’s Great Dharma King,
The Most Compassionate True Master of Teachings.

The Jade Emperor’s Great Dao Lord,
Father of the Great Mystery’s True Dao.
We look up to the Great Canopy Heaven,
To the supreme lord of the Mysterious Vault.

We look up to the Three Clarities’ realm,
To the assembled perfected hosts attending the Celestial Throne.
Cang Hu’s precious pearl,
From which the Great Cavern Scriptures were woven.
The wondrous Dao defies thought;
Jade verses give birth to ten thousand spirits.

The Most Compassionate Primordial Beginning Venerable,
Whose golden image emerged from the earth’s portal.
Manifesting as three divine persons,
Who in hempen robes bestowed golden treasures.
In dreams, two scrolls were tucked into sleeves—

Her phoenix mechanism bore no traceable sign; her crane-like nature aspired to purity beyond discourse. The compassionate mother prior to Heaven and Earth, her graceful countenance timeless—when yang returned on the tenth month’s fifth day, she became the spring of the teaching that expounded the Three Bonds and Five Constants.

Unfolding the phoenix script of post-Heavenly agelessness, he received the Azure Empyrean’s unfathomable dream-state. The great compassionate father of the divine father, the supremely good man among perfected beings—his pulse the root of the Three Bonds and Five Constants, his heart the vessel of a hundred deeds and myriad virtues. Devotion to him knows no end; how could praise ever cease? Great in compassion, great in vow, great in sageliness, great in compassion—the Seven Bends’ Holy Father, the Manifestly Blessed, Compassionately Protective, Benevolent and Prosperous, Commanding Virtue King, the Primordial Great Emperor of Mysterious Inception, the Fruit-Attaining, Longevity-Granting King Bodhisattva, the Heavenly Venerable who Propagates Blessings and Extends Fortune.

With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence to the Holy Mother, born on the seventh day of the seventh month. In the fragrant inner palace, the Auxiliary Palace of Literary Prosperity, her virtuous nature harmonious as spring, she contained the pure qi of the Great True One. Her clear radiance deep as autumn, she nurtured the Seventh Night’s luminous essence. Embracing the dragon’s image before its dispersal, concealing the phoenix’s mechanism before its revelation—great compassionate mother of the Sword Spring, supremely good woman of Penglai—she produced the bonds of ten thousand generations, gave birth to the teachings of the Nine Heavens. Devotion to her knows no end; how could praise ever cease? Great in compassion, great in vow, great in sageliness, great in compassion—the Seven Bends’ Holy Mother, the Illustrious Virtue-Accumulating, Blessing-Inheriting, Compassionate, Reverent, and Gracious Empress Dowager, the Fruit-Attaining, Treasure Radiance Bodhisattva, the Lady who Inherits Blessings and Stores Fortune.

With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence to the Primordial August Emperor, born on the third day of the second month. In the fragrant osmanthus palace, the Upper Palace of Literary Prosperity, through ninety-six lives, he sowed the fruits of goodness in the garden of poetry and books. Through a hundred thousand myriad transformations, he cultivated the osmanthus root in the field of hidden merits. From the Thunder Loom’s illumination on Phoenix Mountain to the Auspicious Storage of Wishes on Turtle Peak, he opened human hearts, grounding them in the filial piety of profound kinship. To prolong the nation’s pulse, he first instilled loyalty to the sovereign. Responding to dreams to protect life, he extended compassion to the suffering. Unassuming in the Jade True Blessing Palace, he manifested ninety-eight transformations in concealment and revelation, displaying divine marvels across billions of kalpas. Wherever the flying phoenix spread teachings, altars were established; aiding the nation and saving the people, all received his virtue. His merits endure in the teachings of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism; his office fulfills the duties of the Heaven, Earth, and Water Officials. His awe-inspiring spirit defies measure; his meritorious deeds surpass thought—supremely benevolent, supremely filial, neither joyous nor proud.

The rites of praise now complete, we rely upon your light to repent:
Seven-Curved Merciful Venerable, true master of the teaching,
Merciful father, merciful mother, born together with me.
Children born as sacred children are all filial and kind;
Grandchildren who continue as divine grandchildren are all kind and filial.
One family’s harmonious qi knows no end;
For ten thousand generations, the moon shines upon the spring terrace.
Merciful light universally illuminates all heavenly beings,
Subtly entering the tiniest dust to fill heaven and earth.
My life shares the same body as heaven and earth,
Just like Literary Flourishing at the beginning of kalpas.
The sacred is not sacred of itself, nor the ordinary ordinary of itself—
Only after drifting to this day do we awaken.
May we encounter the teaching of the Seven-Curved Merciful Venerable,
Devoted to loyalty, to filial piety, to a merciful heart.
Not with verbal karma to scorn gods and humans,
Not with bodily karma to burden parents,
Not with mental karma to deceive heaven and earth,
Not with heart karma to bring calamity upon descendants.
May we follow filial conduct and hidden merit,
Practicing all manner of skillful means in every direction.
Repenting and redeeming the stains of many lives’ transgressions,
We take refuge in the primordial sovereign’s great merciful light.
Seeking descendants, seeking emolument, seeking the means of life—
We seek not from others but from ourselves.
Only our teacher, Literary Flourishing of the Seven Curves,
Through kalpas awaits others with the law of forbearance.
May you release a single wish-fulfilling light,
Compassionately mindful of all beings in true repentance.

Repentance now complete, we proceed to make vows:
May parents together attain the fruit of longevity,
Tortoise years and crane hair reflecting merciful light.
May I myself bow to great good fortune,
Honoring those above and nurturing those below without suffering.
May descendants inhale the osmanthus of clouded cliffs,
Flourishing together with me in fine splendor.
Father’s kindness and children’s filial piety bring spring to the whole family,
Brightness unbetraying the Merciful Venerable’s teaching.
May we receive the Seven-Curved One’s personal guidance,
Pointing the way to ascend as immortals and enter the Dao’s gate.
Abandoning life and receiving life, perfectly and universally knowing,
May all be fulfilled through endless future kalpas.

Vows now complete, we proceed to praise:
Within the osmanthus-scented palace, host of benevolence and filial piety,
Your teaching rain flows everywhere, washing away karmic roots.
Karmic roots transform into osmanthus blossoms’ fragrance,
Good roots planted to bear the fruit of longevity.
One family’s flesh and blood without affliction,
Seven-Curved descendants together protecting and sustaining.
Universally vowing for this life and the next,
Before the Purple Cloud Cliff, attaining the Dao’s fruit.
Step by step, heart by heart, at the Emperor’s side,
Life after life, the heavens ordain.
Though bones may be ordinary and the body reduced to ashes,
A single point of true heart is naturally like metal and stone.

Those who make such vows—on this day, the disciple of this locale, so-and-so, bows to the Primordial Heavenly King and the thousand true and ten thousand sacred beings, holding and reciting the *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture*, beseeching the granting of pardon for transgressions and forgiveness of sins, transforming misfortune into auspiciousness, severing evil roots, advancing in the Dao without demonic obstruction, enabling ancestors and parents to swiftly cross over to the Southern Palace, attaining rebirth in the Middle Land, and may all sentient beings of the family circle equally rely upon refinement. May disasters and calamities be extinguished. In presenting these humble entreaties, we presume upon your heavenly majesty, hoping for sympathetic resonance and gracious compliance with our requests.

The Third Scroll of *The Supreme, Boundless, Primordial, and Perfect Wenchang Great Cavern Sutra*.

The Master of Gan Mountain’s Mowei Grotto, Supreme and Unsurpassed True Lord of Highest Virtue, Rectifies the Mysterious Storehouse Incantation:

The Primordial qi of the Mysterious Origin divides,
Pure radiance opens the grotto’s spirits.
A numinous wind revolves the Great Harmony,
Jade tones gather the flowing essence.
Supreme is this, fundamentally natural—
Who recognizes this mysterious text?
Firm and resolute, illumined in singular awakening,
In an instant one transcends the Three Vehicles.
Still and silent, without root of form,
Through kalpas eternal, how could one drift or sink?
Who can refine and uphold this practice?
Ultimately, one ascends to Jade Clarity.

The Dao speaks: In the primordial Dragon Han kalpa, the Celestial King of the Origin of Origins revealed *The Jade Sutra of the Great Grotto* within the Highest and Vast Jade Clarity Palace. He expounded the Dao of the Supreme Mystery and the Mystery of Mysteries, naming it *The Great Grotto Sutra of the Immortals*. The Celestial King of the Origin of Origins first intoned the Supreme Mystery in a single sound, its resonance flowing through Jade Clarity. He propagated the Imperial Singular True Dao, proclaimed the precious texts of the Great Grotto, demonstrated the methods of the Nine Governances, and transmitted the talismans of the Nine Lights. When scholars recite these, upon purifying themselves and cultivating practice, they immediately gain the joyous celebration of the myriad spirits, the protection of the hundred numina, the resonance of the ten thousand sages, and the presence of the ten thousand immortals. Thereby, one may transcend the Three Calamities and Four Malevolences, the Five Demons and Six Harms, the Seven Injuries and Eight Difficulties, the Nine Adversities and Ten Evils. One ascends as an immortal, enters sagehood, and the spirit is born in Purple Tenuity. Naturally and effortlessly, one is unbound by the constraints of yin and yang, the Five Phases, or the Six qi. With each thought, one grows, hastening toward the Great Vehicle, propagating it endlessly. The myriad heavens below observe, and the Jade Emperor descends his gaze. Flying immortals safeguard and welcome one’s ancestors through kalpas past, their ethereal souls and wandering spirits all attaining rebirth. Lineages connect with immortals, becoming eternally noble. When merit is fulfilled and the Dao perfected, flesh and bone ascend together, riding dragons and driving clouds to ascend and pay homage in Jade Clarity.

The Celestial King of the Origin of Origins, whistling and chanting the Supreme Mystery, concentrated his spirit in distant contemplation and proclaimed the Grotto’s chapters:

The Ancestor of qi is the Supreme Nonbeing,
The lineage of wind inherits the Mystery.
The Mystery’s transmission once severed,
The Four Clarities soothed and pacified.

The Dao speaks: At that time, the Celestial King of the Origin of Origins emitted azure rays from his brows, his crown revolving with purple qi. A canopy of myriad blossoms and precious jewels floated above, a net of gauze veiling his form. Jade light and golden auroras intertwined, shimmering in radiant splendor.

The Jade Clarity Dao Lord, the Great Mystery Dao Father, bowed his head in reverent anticipation, wishing to hear the Cavern Chapters. Thereupon, the Celestial King of the Origin of Origins joyfully intoned:

The Most High, Limitless, and Perfect Wondrous Script of the Celestial Writ of the Great Cavern, Scroll Five

The Supreme Perfected Lord of the Great Mystery, Highest Virtue of Gan Mountain’s Mo Wei Cavern, collated and corrected.

The Dao speaks: At that time, the Celestial King of the Origin of Origins, with the qi of the Highest Cavern’s Primordial Chaos, the Great Nonbeing, the Primordial Heaven’s Treasure, and the Jade Emperor, coalesced a precious pearl, naming it the Azure Barbarian, saying: “I, with this precious pearl, follow the Dao’s wondrous unity, benevolently bestowing the root of life, gestating the mysterious and dividing the primordial, giving birth to the beginning and transmitting the Perfected, transforming and generating the various heavens, congealing into the ten thousand qi. Vast and supreme treasure, only I alone preserve it.

Now, for the Jade Palace Dao Lord, this treasure is reissued. The Celestial Emperor Kings and Heavenly Perfected Great Sages gaze upon the treasure’s radiance, its light spreading into hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions, coalescing into the *Wondrous Script of the Great Cavern*’s jade writ, congealing into clouds, shimmering into chapters. The Celestial Emperor Kings and Heavenly Perfected Great Sages, with pure luminous discernment, with primal penetrating vision, with flowery tongues’ penetration, in unison intone the Great Cavern’s cloud chapters. Their resonance pervades the ten thousand heavens, their echoes flow through the nine earths. Heavenly realms, earthly realms, water realms, and divine lands—all spirits and numina, not leaving their original seats, together behold the cloud chapters, their eyes dazzled by immortal Sanskrit, their ears all attaining comprehension. A hundred lifetimes’ obstructions extinguished, ten thousand kalpas’ dust dissolved. The Three Paths and Nine Dark Realms, the ten directions’ evil destinies, all receive the light and sound. Wherever it reaches, the ten fetters, nine knots, six defilements, and seven dusts—in this instant, all simultaneously attain liberation.

At that time, the Great Mystery Dao Father approached the Xiao Terrace, prostrating twice and bowing his head, seeking to receive the precious pearl’s coalesced *Wondrous Script of the Great Cavern*’s jade writ and cloud chapters, hoping thereby to guide and transform the beings of heaven and humanity, all to avoid the ten thousand disasters, all to dissolve the multitude of sins, not to sink into evil destinies, all to attain the One Vehicle. Vastly nurturing this vow, he earnestly entreated.

The Celestial King of the Origin of Origins commanded the Perfected Jade Palace Dao Lord, the Great Sage of the Primordial Spirit, to assume the proper dignified deportment, and personally bestowed the Azure Barbarian Pearl upon the Great Mystery Dao Father.

The Celestial King of the Origin of Origins proclaimed: “This Azure Barbarian Pearl, together with the sandalwood’s blazing melody—were it not for the Great Mystery, one could not seek or request it. Only your profound compassion and weighty vows permit the bestowal of this precious writ.”

The Five Peaks open their numinous portals,
Transmitting voices to the Great Demon King.
Rivers and seas all receive their duties,
Establishing your responsive assembly.
Preserving the talisman within the Muddy Pellet,
Guarding the spirit named Peach Prosperity.
Reversing illumination to alter death’s register,
Recording immortality as the Fire King’s uncle.
Severing the Three Paths’ afflictions,
Removing calamities to birth the Supreme Flower.
The Seven Mysteries ascend the Vermilion Chamber,
The omen’s body meets in the Jade Hall.
Above befriending the Square Fullness Child,
Below grasping the Principle’s Latent Store.
To the left seizing the Bright Chariot Lord,
To the right assisting the Return to Prosperity.
Merging the Jade Capital’s qi as one,
Transforming the omen to flourish in auspiciousness.
Returning to infancy as the Origin’s Mandate Child,
The Sandalwood blazes with the Auspicious Hook.
The Celestial One’s Origin Root Immortal,
Free within the Wheel of Luminous Radiance.

The Celestial King of the Origin of Origins says:
Within the Jade Clarity’s Myriad Blossoms Palace,
High immortals conceal the Emperor’s scriptures.
The Chart governs the Nine Heavens’ exterior,
Penetrating observation arises from Non-Being.
Seven revolutions summon the myriad spirits,
The Five Peaks come once to the court.
The Three Bureaus beckon the host of demons,
The Recorder reviews their presentations.
Extracting the registers from the Yellow Springs’ depths,
Recording immortality in the Upper Clarity’s annals.

The Celestial King of the Origin of Origins says:
Upon the Dark Continent beyond the Three Fordings,
The Feathered Radiance’s Supreme Non-Being court.
Revolving empyreans fly into the boundless,
Entrusting transformation to merge the myriad essences.
Five clouds luxuriate in the absolute void,
Seven rosy clouds descend upon the Perfect Clarity.
Lustrous the Profound and Boundless Child,
The Brahmanic Prosperity aids the Yellow Tranquility.
The Five Elders wave the crimson blossoms,
Scattering fragrance to bear the Jade Numinous.
Golden substance washes in the Emperor’s river,
Green mists luxuriate with flowing jade.
Divine extraction of the Three Paths’ accumulations,
Immortal embryo knits the omen’s form.

The Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor’s Master, the Great Dao Lord of the Jade Heaven,
With the vermilion palace’s heart-spirit, soars to the Venerable One of the Grand Mystery.

The Celestial King of the Origin of Origins says:
The Three Perfected give birth to the Grand Prime,
Jade portals reflect the dawn’s radiance.
The Grand Simplicity penetrates the primal void,
Cinnabar groves bristle with crimson branches.
Returning spirit to the ninefold palace,
The Southern Prosperity emits jade blossoms.
A hundred meridians receive the fluid elixir,
The Dark Mystery rests in the Three Effulgences’ vale.
The omen-body ascends to Jade Clarity,
Seven ancestors depart the gloomy prison.
Long preserved beyond the kalpa’s end,
For myriad ages they become the immortals’ lineage.
Enthroned as the sagely lineage’s sovereign,
The Jade Clarity’s Grand Cavern spirit.

The Celestial King of the Origin of Origins says:
The Western Prime’s ninefold numinous qi,
Golden elixir flows through the cloud palace.
Above, the supreme jade brilliance transcribes,
Radiant scenes within the Grand Rosy Clouds.
Moving, it revolves the nine heavens’ wheel,
Still, it sinks the eight currents’ net.
Within the chamber dwells the Embryo Immortal Mother,
Who bears the lapels of the Grand Thearch.
The Mysterious Unity’s spirit arises in time,
The Three Elders spread the plain white canopy.
Left hand grasps the omen’s talismanic register,
Right hand carries the governance of the divine lineage.
Together they ascend the numinous dragon’s gate,
Bowing heads in the Jade Clarity’s chamber.
Uprooting the roots of death and extinction,
Nurturing form within the Three and Five.
Seven ancestors dissolve the corpse’s knots,
Receiving blessings from the luminous pearl’s realm.
Above, they attest to the sagely sovereign within,
Talisman-transformed into the Primordial Qi’s king.

The Great Dao Lord of the Jade Heaven says:
My master, the Celestial King of the Origin of Origins, bestowed upon me this *Grand Cavern Sutra of the Immortals*. Its purport is profound and recondite, the wondrous gate of cultivating truth.

First, stabilize the regulated breath—
A thousand harmonies of Grand Harmony.
Midway, contemplate the transformation into truth,
Dissolving forms to disperse dust.
Five thousand primal unities converge,
Sitting in presence, standing in absence.
Grand stabilization perfects truth,
Wondrous practice connects with the numinous.

First is the circulation of qi,
Next is the circulation of spirit,
Finally, the circulation of the numinous.
Ten circulations complete the truth,
The Dao perfected, ascending to the celestial court,
Transcending and soaring beyond,
Passing through the Three Realms,
Coming and going within the Three Clarities,
Attaining the rank of Grand Cavern,
Heavenly One, Thearchic Sovereign.
Six perfections, ten circulations,
Myriad practices perfected,
A thousand harmonies, myriad unions,
Naturally attaining the supreme.

Thus concludes the fifth scroll of the *Grand Cavern Sutra of the Supreme Vastness, the All-True Wenchang*.
