**The Jade Scripture of the Great Cavern**

Hold the tablet centered before the heart, gaze forward, and knock the teeth. Visualize the chamber filled with purple clouds of *qi*, enveloping the body like a crown. Golden Lads and Jade Maidens attend beside the scripture, while the Three Radiances and precious mushrooms illuminate the room. Knock the teeth and softly invoke:

"The heavens are bright, the *qi* is clear,
The Three Radiances illumine the cavern’s light.
Golden chambers and jade halls,
Five mushrooms bloom with treasured might.
Mysterious *qi* and purple canopy,
Descend to grace this form of mine.
Immortal lads and jade maidens,
Bestow your numinous power divine.
The Nine Thearchs align in splendor,
The Three Origins share their car.
Ascend beneath the purple canopy,
To enter the Thearch’s court afar."

**Mystic Concealment Spell for Opening the Scripture**

Pierce the gate of subtle mystery,
Resplendent, vast as empty sky.
The supreme Dao arises in stillness,
Where the Three Primes’ palace comes nigh.
The Great Way is perfected here,
Riding cloud-dragons through the air.
Immortals attend left and right,
Jade maidens and lads so fair.
This body attains the deathless law,
Untangles knots in the spirit’s breeze.
Seven ancestors return to womb,
Their lineage reborn as immortals’ seeds.

Knock the teeth, close the eyes, and bow in prayer, saying:

"Humblest servant [Name], a fleeting mortal of this dust,
Now offers these modest words,
To supplicate the Jade Clarity’s Primordial Lady of the Rosy Origin,
The Lofty Sage, Myriad Perfected, Supreme Dao Lord of the Great Dao,
The Central Yellow Elder, Primordial Simplicity Dao Lord,
The Supreme Clarity’s Marshal of All Immortals, Master of Longevity, Lord of the Three Heavens, Perfected of Cypress Completion,

The Patriarchal Perfected of the Southern Culmen, Supreme Clarity’s Dao Master, Holy Consort of the Jade Dawn, Golden Watchtower’s Protector, Lord of the Eastern Florescence,
The Golden Watchtower’s Grand Master, Supreme Clarity’s Immortal Marquis—

This servant now enters the chamber to recite *The Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Great Cavern*,
Praying that the dawn’s radiance may shine forth,
Illuminating this servant’s viscera and palaces with flourishing splendor,
Dispelling calamities and misfortunes,
Returning the seven ancestors to the womb,
That together we may ride the cloud chariot."

Close the eyes and visualize the Lord of the First Thearch,
Like an infant, four inches tall,
Dwelling within the philtrum beneath the nose,
Governing the assembly of the hundred spirits,
Seated amidst five-colored clouds.
Visualize the Lord of the First Thearch in the empty mystery,
His mouth directly aligned with this servant’s mouth,
Listening to the recitation of the Jade Scripture.

And stabilize the spirit’s resolve.

**Talismanic Script of the Great Cavern’s Illuminating Ward**

Carve the talisman on precious materials,
Inscribing both sides,
Encase it in brocade,
With an outer pouch of yellow silk.
Wear it when conducting affairs,
So that the Demon Kings of the Six Heavens
And the Wardens of the Three Heavens’ Prohibitions
Dare not obstruct or impede.

---

**Inner Secrets for Reciting the Scripture**

Sit upon the Thunderous Numen Talisman,
Wearing the Illuminating Ward Talisman.

Then recite the Concealed Writ
And enter the root scripture.

**The Divine Wisdom’s Concealed Writ of the Great Cavern**

Mysterious radiance scatters the celestial shores,
The clear Han brushes past the returning clouds.
Wondrous *qi* illumines the Three Dawns,
Cinnabar auroras reflect the Purple Tenuity.
The myriad heavens inscribe numinous hues,
Streaming through the skies in profuse array.
The spirit lamp shines bright as the Long Star,
The Net of Separation exhales its luminous ray.
Four peaks gird the lofty clouds,
Mysterious essence shades the eight directions.
The Three Primes open the high void,
Orchid towers unfold their layered gates.
Golden ramparts mirror the Jade Clarity,
Numinous splendor marks the celestial precincts.
Winds arise in the Eightfold Assembly Palace,
Fierce beasts gallop through the clouds.
In the bustling Three Cavern Courts,
Perfected Ones intermingle in disarray.
Above dwell the thousand radiant spirits,
Their hidden virtue towering and sublime.
The Great One gathers the threads of fate,
Grasping life’s reins, wielding the spirit’s banner.
The Orthodox Unity treads the flourishing numen,
Summoning the myriad spirits to return.
The Duke’s son flanks the silent axle,
The Cavern Yang guards the mystery’s pivot.
At the dawn’s clarity, the Dao is harmonized.
The dragon chariot pauses in its circuit.
The Seven Radiances align with the Spirit Kings,
Whirlwind wheels traverse the ten-thousand treetops.
The body soars above the mysterious ford,
Flying steps ascend the ridge’s ladder.
Parting the radiance, enter the spirit’s mound,
Resplendent, the feathered robes tremble.
Hidden depths intermingle in clouded assemblies,
Flying radiance bears the spirit’s communion.
Green peaks without a speck of haze,
Silken unions arise in the void’s expanse.
Golden splendor girds the numinous carriage,
Winged immortals soar in majesty.
Ten-thousand reins scatter through the void,
Lush and misty, the mystery’s upper window.
Within arises the Lord of Harmonized Radiance,
The Nine Thearchs flourish the Supreme August.
The luminous wheel shines upon the Yellow Tranquility,
Feathered pearls gleam in the Mysterious Yang.
The celestial essence of primordial simplicity,
The Central Five named Nurturing Light.
Bound clarity gives birth to the nascent spirit,
Nine Perfected unite as a pair.
Wondrous radiance reveals the hidden reckoning,
Following resonance, it marks the spirit’s trace.
The Muddy Pellet’s cavernous primordial light,
Directs the pearl to the Crimson Palace.
The Gate of Life in the Primordial Yang’s domain,
Three spirits escort the Purple Lad.
Restrain and summon them to return above,
Flanking the portals, attending the bright window.
Canopies face the Brilliant Star,
Circular splendor illumines the Three Thoroughfares.
Square fullness draws forth and connects life,
Reversing age to return to infancy.
Whirlwinds gleam across the Nine Heavens,
Green axles coil around the cinnabar chamber.
Whispering winds weave beyond the mist,
Curved crimson rests in the flowery hall.
Roaming the hidden, gazing upon ten-thousand transformations,
Returning to assemble with the Spirit Sovereign of the Cloudy Empyrean.
The immortal’s path delights in life’s flourishing,
The ghostly path delights in misfortune’s thrall.
One hears only of the precious path of life,
Never of the ghostly path’s rise.
Jade songs harmonize with the celestial *qi*,
The *Primordial Rectitude of Precious Life*’s foremost chapter.
Divine wisdom commands the vermilion troops,
The Five Thearchs’ talismans chill the northern wilds.
Brandishing banners to capture the myriad demons,
Jade writs restrain the Feng’s dark domain.
The body’s dissolution is the Dao’s natural course,
The vanquishing of demons is not your merit.
Floating radiance beats the long fan,
Numinous beings rejoice on the cloudy peak.
Gazing below at the four flying perils,
Heaven’s kalpas never end.

Within the wondrous arises the true vision,
The returning chariot moves as if lingering slow.
The mind aligns, preserving the unseen resonance,
Carrying forth the sublime and lofty marvel.
Soaring wings await the wondrous convergence,
What peer could match this penetrating gaze?
With a whistle, a shout, a sigh in an instant,
Swiftly traversing the nine enclosures.

Within the Dipper dwell four Perfected,
scattering blossoms at Jade Clarity Terrace.
The Thearch’s Minister of the Central Mystery gives birth—
one turn and all Perfected come.
Fragrant winds fan the Three Treasures,
the five viscera reflect Clear Yi.
Azure Hu’s radiant splendor,
sandalwood’s blazing auspicious hook.
The Great Central’s six qi pure,
the winding waters of the Celestial River ascend.
Great Merit’s completion,
the Five Demons fell the Six Yin.
Within, the Primordial King of Yuanshi knots,
loftily beholding the Six Harmonies’ court.
Freshly winding mystery,
mirrored layered chariots.

The Four Perfected are the gods of the Four Dippers. Central Mystery Born is the name of the Mud-Pill Palace’s Thearch Minister. The Three Treasures are a mountain’s name. Clear Yi is a palace’s name. Ascend means to rise. The waters of winding springs flow downward to Northern Feng, rising to become the Celestial River, ascending through the Southern Dipper. Mastering this Dao, the sunken all rise. The Five Thearchs’ Great Demons fell the Six Yin, and yang returns to the Six Palaces.

*Great Cavern Yin Essence Jade Talisman*
Recite the incantation:
Right Eye Lad is named Chenying, styled Yinjing, ever guarding the pupil of my right eye.

welcoming and extending—Dao now complete.
The Director of Destinies presents the Thearch’s script,
styled Mystic Merit Minister.
Preserving life at Great Rosy Cloud Palace,
arrayed as guests in Upper Clarity’s hostels.
The Gate of Destiny joins essence to extend,
guarding my body’s Yellow Peace.
Left, he grasps the Primordial Essence Lord,
right, he seizes the Vermilion Luxuriance Spirit.
Great Harmony crosses the Seven Awakenings,
striking fire to generate true script.
Purple Blossom’s Crown Embryo Immortal,
Primordial Destiny’s Perfected Central Spirit.
Commanding destiny’s root,
ascending Dragon Ford.

The Three Elegances are a mountain’s name. Azure Vastness is a terrace’s name. Welcoming Extension is a talisman’s name. Mystic Merit Minister is the Director of Destinies’ Venerable Lord’s name. Joining Essence to Extend is Peach Vigor Lord’s name. Yellow Peace Child Mystery is the name of the Three Perfected of essence and blood. Primordial Essence Lord is the name of the Peerless Lad. Vermilion Luxuriance Spirit is the name of the Right White Primordial Venerable Spirit. The Seven Awakenings are the fire’s completion number. Moreover, *li* is fire, and from its luminous brilliance emerges the secret of the Cavernous Crimson Script. The Crown Blossom Embryo Immortal means the three blossoms gather at the crown, the embryo knits to form an immortal. The Perfected Central Spirit is the yang spirit within the Perfected.

*Great Cavern Embryo Immortal Jade Talisman*
Recite the incantation:
Lung Department Lad is named Suming, styled Xucheng, ever guarding below my lung department.

*Dao Scripture of the Golden Watchtower Posterior Sage Supreme Peace Li Perfected Celestial Thearch Upper Radiance Lord, Chapter Thirty*
The Golden Watchtower’s Upper Radiance qi,
ten directions gleam with purple mist.
The Three Destinies’ Grand Unity Venerable,
Five Summonses call the Supreme Peace spirits.
Seven Turnings summon the Peak Perfected,
jade talismans announce to the Three Officials.
Extracting the register from the Three Spirits below,
receiving life in the Highest Dawn.
The Grand Spirit Eightfold Spirit King,
one transformation returns felicitous clouds.
Peach Lord guards the Six Harmonies,
inscribing essence to defend the Mud-Pill Palace.
Great Clarity’s Eightfold Radiance Contemplation,
the Ten Virtues’ true script proclaimed.
Preserving your child, Spirit within Spirit,
Primordial Destiny arises naturally.

Radiance extending inscribed,
attaining solar worthies.

The Golden Watchtower is the lung. The Grand Unity Embryo Venerable manifests as needed; the Supreme Peace Posterior Sage naturally communicates with spirits. The Peak Perfected are the host of Perfected of the Five Peaks. Proclaiming jade talismans to the Three Officials Thearchs, removing death registers from the Three Spirits’ divine realm, one then receives life in the Highest Dawn Palace. The Eightfold Spirit Lord is the name of the Grand Thearch’s essence and soul. The Six Harmonies are the name of the Bright Hall. Inscribing essence and Mud-Pill Palace are the names of the Thearch Minister. The Eight Radiance are the names of eight spirits.

*Great Cavern Embryo Spirit Jade Talisman*
Ingest the talisman and silently recite the incantation:
Within the embryo, the One Primordial White Qi Lord is named Wuxuanzi, styled Yushangsheng. The Grand Unity’s essence and soul is named Xuanguizi, styled Shengchang, titled Eightfold Spirit King. These two spirits ever guard above my five viscera, at the root gate of the throat’s junction.

The throat’s junction is also called Golden Tower, also called Layered Tower, also called Three Thoughts Terrace. Twelve spirits reside within, including Pavilion Leader Perfected, who governs the communication of upper and lower qi.

*Dao Scripture of the Supreme Void Posterior Sage Primordial Radiance Peng Chamber Perfected Lord, Chapter Thirty-One*
Supreme Void’s empty radiance,
within rosy clouds lies Peng Chamber.
Nine clouds seal layered gates,
the Thearch Lord stills in profound secrecy.
Eight Perfected join Radiance Lord,
above, they grasp the Female Grand Unity.
Male and female blend in Jade Chamber,
nine transformations return to seven.
Dispersing forms throughout the Six Harmonies,
the Mud-Pill Palace’s distinctions shift.
The Grand Perfected’s Ninefold Light Wheel,
Ten Abodes’ script knots.
Preserving your child’s Primordial Qi flows,
the five qi govern Central Jie.
Blending as one to return to the Thearch’s watchtower,
eternal life without end.
Transforming to fly into Upper Clarity,
three thousand practices transcend.

The Wheel ascends,
entering the profound lineage.

Empty Radiance is a mountain’s name. Peng Chamber is Peng Lord’s chamber, within which resides the talisman for extending life. Layered gates are doors. Joining Radiance Lord is the name of the eight Perfected within the gallbladder. The Ten Abodes are the Ten Grounds; one pertains to yang. Briefly passing the brush to the right makes it yin—this is the origin of coupling. This speaks of script, precisely capturing the meaning of reversing yin to yang. Governing Central Jie means governing the five qi within, blending the hundred spirits; *jie* means ascending.

*Great Cavern Central Knot Jade Talisman*
Recite the incantation:
Central Knot Azure Qi Lord is named Anyanchang, styled Heheying. The Primordial Lord’s essence and soul is named Baogu Tongzi, styled Mingguang. These two spirits ever guard below my five viscera, above the stomach’s upper opening.

Directly pointing to the stomach’s opening, visualize its spirit within the stomach’s opening. Previously mentioned were the two Perfected of the stomach tube, visualizing their spirits outside the stomach’s opening.

*Dao Scripture of the Supreme Mystery Capital Nine Qi Venerable Lord Master Immortal Lord, Chapter Thirty-Two*
Above the Supreme Nine Qi,
mist swirls between Great Radiance.
Divine light adorns empty peaks,
the Five Paths illumine the Three Heavens.

Riding the light to ascend the utmost heavens,
borne on the wind to disperse stagnant spirits.
The Central One is called "Moving Pearl,"
governing the heart to enter serene repose.
Merging the Three and Five Palaces,
transforming through countless eons.
Severing the roots of the fetal tree’s growth,
forever cutting the blood-corpse’s origin.
Seven ancestors disperse accumulated stagnation,
returning to the obscure mystery of flourishing darkness.
Myriad qi generate myriad channels,
all equally transmuting into immortals.
The Supreme Mystery initiates the Ten Illuminations,
wondrous practices ascend the Ten Perfected.

Without obstruction, the light serves the divine void.

The Supreme Mystery Capital lies above the Nine Qi;
the Nine Qi are the incense of returning souls.
*Great Radiance* is the name of a palace.
*Empty Peak* is the name of a mountain.
*Five Paths* is the name of a palace.
*Dispersing Stagnant Spirits* is also the name of a mountain.

*Great Cavern Central Knot Jade Talisman*

Central Knot Black Qi Lord is named Binlaisheng, styled Jingshangmen. The Imperial Perfected’s essence and soul is named Youtaiwang, styled Guanshangsheng. These two spirits ever guard the opening of my nine intestines, below the *fubo* (hidden beam).

The opening of the nine intestines is where the urine exits; the *fubo*’s lower gate is the junction between the large and small intestines. According to the secret instructions: the *fubo*’s lower gate lies behind the scrotum and before the anus, at the center between the two yin.

*Dao Scripture of the Highest Clarity Eight August Lords, Chapter Thirty-Three*
Beyond the utmost clouds of Highest Clarity,
the Eight August Lords revolve the Nine Heavens.

Within the profound solitude, the Imperial Heir is born,
bearing transformation to those who dwell in radiant light.
At dawn, they ascend the Great Elder’s repose;
at dusk, they feast in the Golden Flower’s ease.
With feathered tablets, they summon the Great One;
with brocade talismans, they call forth the myriad spirits.
They strengthen my dark-womb immortal,
hewing away the roots of the placental tree.
They unbind the knots of the seven ancestors,
dispersing calamity to pacify the nine lineages.
The Crimson Emperor’s cinnabar numen stands firm,
aiding the omen to enter the Golden Gate.
The Moon Mother’s numinous white orchid
guards and seals the Gate of Death’s radiance.
From this day forth, the qi of death is cut off;
the essence of life henceforth extends.
The myriad spirits and dark immortals,
transcending, become Perfected Kings of their stations.
The ten Perfected complete their wondrous practice,
the Great Mystery unites the luminous and the yang.
The Supreme Great Cavern Venerable,
one qi harmonizes with Dragon Radiance.
Illuminating the kalpas, bridging the severed.

*Great Cavern Womb-Center Jade Talisman*
Recite the incantation in silence:

The Great One Lord, styled Profound Solitude Prime,

*Danling* is the name of a terrace.
*Lingsu Lan* is the title of the Moon Mother.

These two spirits ever guard within my small intestine,
the root of its two apertures.
At the small intestine’s end, the womb-pouch is bound.
The womb has one cord, joined within the lower abdomen;
its right cord governs the passage of water,
its left cord leaks forth the essence’s radiance.
Thus are the two apertures of desire.

*Scripture of the Highest Dawn, Master Jade Protector King Azure Lad, Eastern Florescence Fangzhu Palace, Chapter Thirty-Four*
Eastern Florescence emits its first light,
Highest Dawn illumines Supreme Purity.
The Cavern shines with the halo of the Round Pearl,
lucid and bright, the Purple Luminary gleams.
Seven spirits return to the Emperor’s seat,
Five Elders soar on jade wheels.
The Supreme One, King within the Radiant Scene,
Controller of Life commands the ten thousand spirits.
Floating amid cloud-waves, silently gazing toward
the Mud-Pill Palace’s city.

erasing death to inscribe long life.
Thrice raising the Thunder-Spirit Talisman,
mystically dissolving the great demonic essences.
Seven ancestors are born into the Hall of Fortune,
Mysterious Florescence safeguards Yellow Tranquility.
Observe the carriage’s repose, the luminous guest’s flourishing—
*First Light* is the land of the sun’s rising,
*Highest Dawn* is the name of a palace.
*Round Pearl* and *Purple Luminary* are both names of the sun.
*Yellow Tranquility* is the name of the Three Perfected of essence and blood.

Recite the incantation in silence:

The Blood-Center Crimson Radiance Lord,
styled Blended Unity, named Uncle Preserver of Firmness.
The Controller of Life’s essence-soul,
styled Hair-Knot Unity, named Celebrant of the Mysterious.
These two spirits ever guard my hundred joints’ blood,
below the severed nodes.
Through kalpas receiving form,
none has not been constituted by essence and blood.
Thus, if the nodes remain knotted and unresolved,
the Dao of immortality is difficult to achieve.
The Scripture states: “The gate of the severed bones of both legs
lies below the joints of the leg meridians,
outward toward the depression beneath the ankle bones—
this depression is called the Gate of the Severed Bones.”

These seven spirits ever guard the root of my original destiny,
the womb’s primordial knot.
The root of original destiny is the navel wheel,
the root-stem of qi’s division between child and mother.
The womb’s great knot lies within the navel,
connected to the kidneys, the gate of the embryo’s formation.
The inner and outer palaces of the Gate of Destiny:
within one inch of the navel lies a band leading to the Gate within the Cinnabar Field,
the place of the embryo’s formation.
The outer palace refers to the exterior of the kidneys,
the inner palace to the interior of the navel—
they are but one locus.

*Lesser Cavern Jade True Myriad Flowers Master’s Diagram Jade Lord Scripture, Chapter Thirty-Six*
Within the Jade True Myriad Flowers Palace,
lofty immortals conceal the Thearch’s scriptures.

The Chart Master governs the nine heavens’ outer realm,
penetrating insight births from the formless void.
Seven revolutions summon the myriad perfected,
the Five Marchmounts arrive at once before the court.

The Orthodox Unity Left Immortal is named Zhongchengzi, styled Fourfold Flower Venerable, also called Thearch’s Guest.

In men, it is called Nine Bends; in women, Lower Gate.

ever guarding within the bladder.
The bladder lies before the small intestine and womb,
transmitting to both sides, intimately connected.
Thus when the small intestine is full of water,
the bladder’s lesser yang qi steams it,
whereupon the water within the intestine
follows the yang qi through the womb and transforms back into water.

The Incantation of the Supreme Mystery Perfected One
The Perfected One, surnamed Zhao and named Shouzhen, presides over the Palace of Supreme Mystery and Clarity.
Heaven within heaven, the celestial peak and sacred summit,
Pavilions and terraces, palaces and halls, chambers and courts,
Cavernous abodes and jade chambers, halls of fortune and golden cities,
Spiritual chariots and imperial seats, the names of the highest ranks—
All passages and orifices open and flow,
Doors and windows, lattice and frames,
Sun, moon, and stars leap forth, light fills the eyes,
Wind, clouds, mist, and auroras, qi congeals in harmony,
Rivers, pools, and ocean waves, blood and fluids, essence and spirit,
The five viscera and six bowels, the face and form of the body,
The womb’s knots and nodes—each harbors its own spirit.
Seek them and they are unseen, call them and they respond at once.
Though spirits number in the millions, they serve the One of Pure Tranquility.
One source, myriad streams—though turbid or clear,
All rivers return to a single source, the four seas merge as one.
Vast is the Cavern of Emptiness, the Six Harmonies’ Yellow Court,
The True One is undivided, the Dharma gate has no lock.
The thirty death gates, their deathly qi ever frozen—
I call to my spirits, ever keeping them wakeful,
As if from sleep they awaken, as if from drunkenness they sober.
Empty and numinous, the Valley Spirit unites the Five Phases,
Ninety-seven forms radiate great light.
The qi of the death gates naturally regenerates,
Ancestral qi returns to moisten, descendant branches flourish.
Litigation ceases, grievances dissolve without trace,
All beings are universally delivered, wondrous practice reaches completion.
The wealth of the Great Cavern overflows with myriad treasures,
Its nobility ascends to the highest immortal ranks.

Ascending to the Supreme Mystery and Upper Clarity.

The Great Dao Lord of the Azure Youth,
Treading the clouds of Fusang in the east,
Transmits the Great Cavern’s decree,
Luminous stanzas and resplendent talismanic script.
Resonant jade tones, pure echoes reach the imperial gates.
Moved by compassion for the world of mortals,
He vanquishes demons and dispels malevolent vapors.
Bestowing upon me the light of purity,
Its vast salvation illumines without bound,
Like the ancient Cang Jie, he ferries those within the Mystery.
The Five Palaces bloom with radiant hues,
The Nine Origins ever guard the body.
Tiger robes subdue all evil,
Dragon banners summon the hundred spirits.
The Net of Separation exhales white qi,
Revealing the dawn of the highest realms.
The Supreme Unity blends yin and yang,
The Seven Perfected divide them.
Briefly visiting the Six Abyssal Palaces,
Then returning to the Ninefold Wheel of Light,
Eternally enduring beyond all kalpas,
Forever neighbor to the Great Beginning.

The Purple Void Lady, named Yuanjun,
Rides a simurgh to pay homage at the Mysterious Capital.
In hand she holds the *Great Cavern Scripture*,
Its jade pendants chiming with a crystalline ring.
Dividing the stanzas into thirty-nine,
She exhales qi to inscribe the numinous talismans.
Summoning and gathering the spirits of the living body,
She guards their abodes in stillness and secrecy.
The Nine Perfected stand in solemn vigil,
The Three Origins protect the storehouses.
To her left, she carries the Thousand Radiance Essence,
To her right, she embraces the Ever-Upholding One.
Together they enter the Yellow Chamber in joy,
Their mirrored hearts retaining the cloud-like pearl.
Roaming the True Yang Lodge,
Her ancient chariot drawn by feathered luminaries,
Green peaks pierce the empyrean,
Dark radiance grazes the celestial thoroughfare.
The profound root of the Cavern’s subtlety,
The vast and boundless arising from the Great Nonbeing—
Who could have foreseen that in a mere instant,
She would surge forth with the fury of wind and thunder?
Forever preserved as an immortal elder,
Myriad spirits attend her call.

On the Three Mao Brothers of Mount Juqu,
Ranked among the immortals’ assembly,
They welcome the Lady Wei Yuanjun,
Her golden tablets inscribed with jade patterns.
Resplendent in crimson auroras,
Adorned with towering Jade Dawn crowns,
Within purple chambers and brocade canopies,
Their courtyards lined with azure jade.
With one heart they approach the Orchid Gate,
Step by step ascending the Heavenly Altar.
Carefree, they tread the Milky Way,
Whistling and roaming, their pendants chiming.
The Three Dawns scatter spiritual radiance,
The Four Seas calm their waves.
Swiftly they ride divine tigers,
Brushing their robes as they mount azure simurghs.
Ascending to the honored ranks of the sagely lineage,
Dissolving the hardships of accumulated kalpas.
Inhaling the qi of the Nine Spirits,
Refining the Sevenfold Return Elixir.
Nurturing form within the imperial chamber,
Revolving the wind to open the celestial gates.
The Dao flows through natural essence,
Numinous power descends to the mortal realm.

Purple portals birth Brahma qi,
Golden light blazes through the Nine Clarities.
All spirits unite in harmony,
The Great Sage awaits the Jade Capital.
Cavern stanzas chant jade tones,
The Central Yellow unfolds the precious scripture.
The Five Emperors proclaim jade talismans,
The Three Officials summon the hundred spirits.
Kalpa after kalpa, they respond to great peace,
Returning to the root like an infant.
The true wind ever billows,
The Dao’s qi perpetually pure.
Jade maidens scatter gem-like blossoms,
Golden lads leisurely tend the jade gates.
The Non-Action Red Origin Lord,
Accompanies the Dao in its rising and sinking.

*Lower Grade of the Inner Jade Stanza of Jade Clarity*
Towering, the Ninefold Mountain of Light,
Its jade towers housing the highest immortals.
Sun and moon circulate golden qi,
Dragon and tiger rush through the Mysterious Pass.

Irrigating the chambers of azure mushrooms,
Divine sprouts rise in emerald mist.
Resplendent, the purple auroras glow,
Myriad sages descend in cloud-borne chariots.
Cavern hymns ring clear and bright,
Piercing through heaven upon heaven.
Should one preserve this chamber,
For ten thousand kalpas they become a celestial immortal.
The inner treasure is not sought without—
This is the supreme mystery.
Refining the great vessel of treasure,
One dissolves and drifts back to the imperial chariot.

**Talisman of the Capital Artisan**
*Incantation for Ingesting the Talisman:*
The sun rises, vast and radiant,
True Martial roams and traverses.
Marching with talisman, commanding water,
Seated, surveying the four directions.
Seek the Dao and attain the Dao,
Seek immortality and attain immortality.
Long life and enduring vision,
Rank receives true auspices.
At the sight of myriad evils,
Their hearts tremble in dread.
Hasten, hasten, as decreed by statute and ordinance.

*Usage:* Ingest with reverent invocation. For ablutions, this talisman is also used.

Also named *The Great Cavern Jade Clarity Register of the True Talisman of the Capital*, this is the first talisman in the Jade Script Talisman Treasury of the Lord Lao, the foremost of the three numinous writings.

*The Perfected of the Great Mystery’s Incantation:*
Thirty-nine portals,
Firmly guarded by spirits.
Before hearing the Jade Scripture,
None knew their names.
Thirty-nine talismans,
Circulate with the qi’s movement.
Without seeing the Jade Scripture,
Their patterns remain obscure.
I possess the affinity of the Dao,
My heart revolves the Jade Scripture.
The scripture commands reverence,
The scripture commands sincerity.
Talismans seek unity with qi,
Spirits respond in unison.
The numinous valley, cavernous and void,
Myriad sounds resonate of themselves.
The azure sky bears no clouds,
Yet the true script emerges on its own.
The principle of resonance,
Gathers spirit and concentrates essence.
The fetal knot unravels of itself,
The corpse’s blood clarifies on its own.
Yang returns to the ancestral root,
The mysterious blossom flourishes evergreen.
Father’s serenity, mother’s essence,
Revolving wind, congealing staff.
The precious pearl radiates light,
Returning to the womb, the infant coalesces.
Qi revolves the vast potter’s wheel,
Fire and timing harmonized.
Embrace the feminine, hold the masculine,
Withdraw vision, return hearing.
Nurture the infant child,
Wealth and honor fill the Yellow Court.
Ascent and descent occur naturally,
The mirror turns toward Jade Clarity.
Once the fetal carriage returns,
The jade mat ascends on high.
After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is complete,
Dragon and crane come to welcome.
Merit accomplished, fame achieved,
The mystery and the common alike shine in glory.
