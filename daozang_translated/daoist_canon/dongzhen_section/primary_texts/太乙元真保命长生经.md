*The Scripture of Supreme Oneness and Primordial Perfection for Preserving Life and Attaining Longevity*

**Title:** *The Scripture of Supreme Oneness and Primordial Perfection for Preserving Life and Attaining Longevity*. Author unknown. One fascicle. Source text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Division, *Benwen* Category.

The Supreme Oneness and Primordial Perfection states:
The accumulation of yang forms the spirit; the accumulation of yin forms the body.
Yin and yang, each half, unite to compose the self.
Like the sun and moon adorning the void, they ceaselessly alternate day and night, each fulfilling its allotted part.
Sorrow and joy, anger and delight, assail one another in turn—hence arise birth, aging, sickness, and death.

Now, foreknowledge is the child of the Dao; bodily transformation is the mother of the Dao.
Having known the child, one must recognize the mother.
The mother is the emanation of the Most High;
The child is the One within the original heart.
When these two unite as one, the embryo nurtures both form and soul.
Those who can perceive this may attain enduring existence.

Thus, those skilled in profound contemplation inwardly gaze without blinking, inwardly listen without distraction.
They cause the desiring to be without desire, and the undesiring to desire,
Transforming yin through yang, harmonizing the heart through equilibrium.
When the heart is harmonized and the blackness stilled, yin weakens and spirit aligns.
When spirit aligns, essence becomes concentrated;
When essence is concentrated, shadows vanish;
When shadows vanish, form is forgotten;
When form is forgotten, spirit responds;
When spirit responds, harmony is achieved.
When harmony is achieved, the celestial essence-light may enter.
Once the essence-light enters, yang and blackness transform alone,
The entire body ascends into emptiness, moving without obstruction—
Just as when returning elixir enters the mouth, all yin burdens are dispelled.
Concentrating yin to summon spirit, one attains deathlessness.

In secret, the immortal assembly chants the divine incantations:
*"The Three Pure Realms above,
Supreme Oneness and Primordial Perfection,
Disseminate harmony and transform through the Dao,
Unfold the light to deliver humanity.
The Solar Palace refines the soul,
The Lunar Wheel examines the po.
The Heavenly Emperor governs the blackness,
The Earthly Official scatters flying dust.
One thousand two hundred numinous beings,
Twelve thousand spirits,
Together compose the immortal dwelling,
Establishing the true body.
Within the true body,
The Seven Governors and Nine Palaces,
The radiance of the heart shines brightly,
Illuminating the Mysterious Luminous Palace.
The Great Spirit of Luminous Emptiness,
The harmonious qi and true heart,
Inwardly purify the five viscera,
Externally summon the five spirits.
Unceasing profound contemplation,
Unfolds the light to deliver humanity—
The aged revert to vigor,
The decayed return to freshness.
Feasting on the Six Jia,
The Three Luminaries share spring’s vitality.
Twelve officials and soldiers
Guard and protect your body.
Recite a thousand times daily,
Ascend to pay homage to the Primordial Sovereign.
The Primordial Perfection Venerable Lord,
The solitary survival of the Supreme Dao,
Preserves your primordial life,
Guards your numinous root.
Diligently strike the celestial drum,
Harmonize the form and refine the soul.
Recite in unison without forgetfulness,
And you shall behold the divine honored ones.
Spurring the void, riding the floating,
Ascending to heaven, treading the clouds."*
Upon completing the recitation of this incantation, fix your gaze and concentrate,
Let spirit guide spirit and blackness,
Eradicating all myriad illnesses within the body, instantly healing them.

For those cultivating the method of attaining longevity and the Dao,
Recite this incantation.
After one hundred thousand recitations, sit upright and contemplate inwardly,
Without further external distractions.
Within ten years, you shall naturally attain the Dao.

To protect the nation,
The Emperor and Lord of the Dao in times of preservation should recite this scripture,
Invoking the spirit to preserve life,
Performing meritorious deeds to save others.
Thus, yin and yang will not err,
Wind and rain will be harmonious and timely.
In times of war, flood, or drought,
Cast the Sixteen Perfected Ones and the image of the Supreme Oneness in accordance with *The Scripture of the Supreme Oneness and Sacred Perfection*.
Perform purification rites and recitations,
And you shall triumph in all endeavors.
The method is fully recorded in *The Scripture of the Supreme Oneness and Sacred Perfection*.

If encountering a Daoist cultivating the true path, transmit it through an altar covenant.
If meeting an ordinary person, do not rashly transmit it,
Lest it bring calamity to the nine generations and punishment to the six relations.
Beware! Guard it as you would your eyes.

The various immortals, having heard this, pay homage and follow its teachings,
Each returning to their original office,
Contemplating the wondrous Dao.
Store it in a golden coffer,
Seal it in a jade case,
Recite it day and night,
Never casually reveal it to others.
Only the masters of the immortal gate should adhere to this teaching.
