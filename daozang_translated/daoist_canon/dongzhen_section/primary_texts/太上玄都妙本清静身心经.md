**The Supreme Mysterious Capital Wondrous Original Scripture on Purifying Body and Mind**

At that time, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning was in the Great Regulator of the Primordial Yang’s Upper Observatory of the Mysterious Capital, within the Purple Jade Palace of the Seven-Jewel Flowery Grove. The Most High Dao Lord, together with the sacred assemblies of the ten directions, the perfected immortals of all heavens, the sovereigns of the three realms, and all celestial spirits, dragons, ghosts, and beings awaiting deliverance—an innumerable multitude—had ascended to the station of True Unity, attained the mind of non-action, and gathered together in that place.

The palaces and observatories of the Mysterious Capital were adorned with gold, silver, lapis lazuli, coral, amber, true pearls, jasper, and all manner of treasures, their radiance blazing brilliantly to illuminate both within and without. The assembled perfected ones, seated in ranks, defied enumeration; spontaneous auspicious signs manifested before the Venerable One.

Heaven rained down jeweled blossoms, scattering them across the earth; divine lutes and refined music sounded of themselves without being struck. A hundred harmonies of sacred incense wafted forth in fragrant streams.

At that moment, the fourfold assembly rose in astonishment and doubt, silently pondering in their minds, none daring to speak first. The Heavenly Worthy stroked the armrest, forestalling their impulse to question, and entered the gate of wisdom-contemplation. Manifesting the Dao of non-action, he reflected upon the primordial moment when the myriad beings first received their endowment, then intoned in a vast voice, addressing the fourfold assembly:

“All you men and women, the original ground of your bodies and minds was utterly pure and still, the true mark unshaken, constant and unchanging from beginning to end, like empty space—coming and going without hindrance, free from defilement, cut off from all craving and conceptualization. Your fundamental nature was serene and luminous, inherently devoid of birth and extinction. Yet through inversion, you followed karma to assume form, like a bright pearl buried forever in dung and filth, hidden for kalpas without beholding its radiance.

You men and women, and all beings to come, cling to the illusory body and delude yourselves as to the true Dao. You create inverted karma, accumulate false and deceptive dust, bury the pearl of wisdom, and amass the grime of ignorance. You sink into the ocean of birth and death, drown in the currents of craving and attachment, dwell in the realm of the five desires, abide in the domain of the four demons, beset by delusion and affliction, bound in body and mind. Following karma, you revolve through the three evil destinies and five paths, your true nature obscured, the mysterious pearl submerged, your original radiance veiled—thus you cycle through birth and death without hope of liberation.

Therefore, I now open the wondrous gate that you may awaken. All you of the fourfold assembly, by your inherent power, draw forth the water of Dao-nature, gather the incense of non-action, and blend the broth of wisdom. Abiding in the chamber of purity, remove the root and branch impurities of all beings, wash away the dust of false illusion, and lead them into the gate of wisdom to contemplate true suchness. The leaks and burdens of affliction shall be utterly extinguished. Illuminating the One Vehicle, you shall profoundly comprehend the two boundaries. Returning to the source and reverting to the origin, you shall recover your pure emptiness. Attaining the Dao naturally, you shall forever be free from transmigration.”

When the great assembly heard this teaching, they reverently reflected upon it, their minds opened and their understanding deepened. Filled with joy, they leapt up, prostrated themselves before the Dao, and knelt to chant:

The Most High, Peerless, Greatly Compassionate Worthy,
You skillfully expound the inverted karma of beings.
The wondrous root of all dharmas is ever pure and still;
When stirred, one sinks and drifts for ten thousand kalpas.
Once false thoughts are planted, the roots of greed and ignorance grow;
Following those roots, the leaves of affliction arise.
Blossoms and leaves flourish to fill the world,
Good and evil revolve in endless layers.
Madly deluded, they vie for false and deceptive fruit,
Parent and child, fruit upon fruit, unbroken in succession.
The grime of affliction, thick and heavy, covers the bright pearl;
Body and mind, foul and filthy, stray from purity.
You show us how to draw forth the water of Dao-nature,
Washing away a thousand evils to return to the One True.
The broth of equanimous purity and wisdom
Scours away the grime of ignorance to reveal true nature.
Swiftly entering the chamber of right contemplation,
The incense and water of non-action settle clear as a mirror.
They illumine the inverted karma of past and future,
Washing away greed, anger, the preceptor’s discipline, and meditative concentration.
The ailments of mind-grime and affliction are wholly dispelled;
Each recovers their true root and returns to the life of wisdom.
The teaching of the Compassionate Worthy is beyond conception—
We prostrate ourselves in reverence and devotion.”

At that moment, among the assembly there was a perfected one named Dharma-Comprehension, who rose from his seat, adjusted his robe and headscarf, took up an incense burner, and with measured, refined steps, composed his spirit and calmed his thoughts. Collecting his attention and settling his mind, he knelt before the Dao and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “We are most fortunate to have been included in this assembly. Since taking our seats, we have never before heard such a teaching. The minds and perceptions of the fourfold assembly remain shrouded in darkness.”

“Pray, Divine Worthy, bestow your sacred instruction. We implore your compassion to pity our inadequacies.”

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy stroked the table and smiled faintly, replying to Dharma-Comprehension: “Excellent, good man! That you, in this Dharma assembly, seek to resolve doubts and awaken understanding will be a true reliance for sentient beings of the degenerate age. Your merit and virtue shall thereby be further exalted. Whatever you do not comprehend, ask freely; do not harbor doubts or obstinate attachments in your mind.”

Dharma-Comprehension, receiving this grace, bowed deeply and inquired: “The multitudes, foolish and deluded, rise and perish according to their karma, their defilements deep and heavy, their confusion binding them. Now, having prepared the Dharma decoction and established the Pure Chamber to wash away the roots of transgression and purge bodily impurities—we beg to know: what are the rites and procedures?”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Good man, on the ten auspicious days of each month, take the finest water and blend it with the Dharma incense decoction. Within the Pure Chamber, sit in right mindfulness and first contemplate body and mind: defilements and delusions, measureless in number, have together formed this body. Externally and internally, greed and ignorance—both coarse and subtle impurities—along with birth, aging, and impermanence, bind one in the knots of suffering. The three karmic actions obstruct the Dao; the six sense-objects veil the mind like clouds obscuring the bright sun. Having thus reflected, use the Dharma incense decoction to bathe, in due order, the skin, the four limbs, the five bodily constituents, the six sense organs, and the nine orifices, purifying them all. Once the outer is cleansed, employ quiet contemplation to refine and transform the delusions of the mind—all afflictions, false thoughts, attachments, greed, anger, and ignorance—rendering them wholly pure. With both inner and outer purified, abide in the Dharma-body and mind, ever dwelling in the Dao-field, cutting off false and defiled states. This is the essential method of the Dharma decoction’s purifying power.”

Upon hearing this, the assembled perfected ones all praised and marveled, snapping their fingers in repentance and chanting in unison, “Excellent!”

At that moment, the perfected one, by virtue of his knowledge of past lives and insight into the minds of others, perceived that in the latter age there would be beings whose minds were benighted and who remained unenlightened regarding the Dharma. Seizing the opportunity, he bowed and advanced to ask: “We humbly inquire: by what name is this sutra, expounded in this assembly, to be known for its cultivation, offering, and merit? How is it that the conditioned, contingent body, once liberated, may also confer blessings upon the unconditioned, true consciousness? We, though unworthy, occupy the rank of perfected ones, yet remain unversed in this profound meaning. We beseech the Divine Worthy to specially bestow your illumination, to rain the nectar of wisdom upon humans and gods, and to spread the clouds of insight without limit.”

Then the Heavenly Worthy, rejoicing, replied: “Remarkable! Perfected one, you possess knowledge of past lives and insight into the minds of others, awaken to the One Vehicle, and comprehend the mechanisms of the three times. You are able to make this earnest request for the sake of the future. I shall now expound fully; listen carefully.

The nature and characteristics of all beings are fundamentally empty. Though temporarily lodged in form, they ultimately return to dissolution. Not abiding in the three times, how can they be bound to a single body? Realizing the emptiness of the conditioned, one naturally transcends the false. With emptiness and no-falsehood, what need is there for reliance? Those who truly understand know that the contingent, conditioned body must be cultivated. In life, it is thus; in death, it is the same. When an ordinary person’s life ends, their consciousness dwells in the intermediate state. If aided by wholesome karma, they are certain to attain a higher rebirth. Therefore, their family and fellow practitioners should perform meritorious deeds: adorn the great jeweled altar with various ornaments, hang banners and canopies, observe fasts and make vows, lecture and recite this sutra, burn incense and light lamps to illuminate the dark night, liberate the suffering soul, and enable it to behold the light. With the non-action Dharma decoction, wash away its manifold impurities. Only when the spirit is utterly pure may it ascend to heaven, return to that realm of purity and spontaneity, and rejoin the natural domain.

The merit of this sutra is immeasurable, like empty space, impossible to quantify. Those who copy, venerate, and uphold it shall attain a wondrously pure original nature, their bodies and minds immaculate, and receive boundless rewards, equal to motes of dust. Therefore, it is named *The Wondrous Original Purity of Body and Mind from the Mystic Capital*.

You, the four assemblies—good men and women—should know that this sutra is foremost among methods of deliverance, foremost among rites for averting calamity, foremost among practices of cultivation, foremost among non-action teachings, foremost among wisdom teachings, and foremost among methods of contemplation and practice. This sutra is subtle and wondrous, inconceivable; among all other Dharmas, there is none that is not surpassed by it. In the past, I and the Heavenly Worthies practiced it and thereby attained the Dao. You should treasure and guard it; do not transmit it lightly. If you find a worthy recipient, then confer it with burning incense, vows, and reverent devotion. The Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions will surely record your names. The Azure Radiance Youth, the Cinnabar Prime Perfected One, the Plain Light Jade Maiden, the Mystic Palace Messenger, and the Yellow Center Great Spirit, leading their retinues of thirty-six attendants, will safeguard this sacred text and protect you. If you cultivate and recite it with a tranquil mind, contemplating form and spirit day and night with diligent reflection, sparing no effort, you shall attain clarity in the Three Palaces, purity in the six consciousnesses, completion of the ten transformations of karma, the five spirits abiding within, and the great non-action Dao manifesting in body and mind. All demonic forces will naturally subside.”

Having spoken thus, all the men and women in the assembly rejoiced. Suddenly, the Heavenly Worthy closed his eyes and raised his voice. The four assemblies gazed upward in reverence, none daring to inquire further. Joining their hands before the Dao, they chanted in verse:

The wondrous original is ever pure,
Body and mind free of stain and grime.
Yet beings, bound by habitual karma,
Remain deluded, harboring doubt and division.
Thus the Compassionate Worthy is moved
To clarify the provisional and the real.
The One Mark delivers all beings—
Truly the speech of equality.
Once defilements are removed,
Afflictions naturally depart.
Bearing the craftsman’s perfected virtue,
We ascend to the Mystic Capital’s governance.

When the assembly of sages had recited this verse, the Heavenly Worthy, smiling serenely, emitted a five-colored, subtle, and wondrous divine light that penetrated the heavenly halls of blessings and the nine dark hells of the long night. By this divine light, the four assemblies of men and women beheld the karmic retributions of the heavens and the hells as clearly as if observing their own palms. With one mind, they took refuge and repented their past-life karmic burdens and present-life deep misfortunes, vowing to liberate all beings from suffering and affliction.

The Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion for the assembly’s devotion, displayed divine majesty—snapping fingers and clicking teeth—whereupon all hells at once attained tranquility, and the imprisoned hungry ghosts together ascended to the Dao’s realm. The radiant light withdrew its illumination, yet the dharma-realm remained luminous. Forests, trees, mountains, and rivers all appeared in serene equality. Auspicious winds stirred, and the sun of wisdom cast its glow. All present in the dharma assembly were elevated to true rank. The hosts of sages from the ten directions, the beings of the three realms, and the myriad multitudes all received benefit. Bowing in reverence, they paid homage and vowed to follow the teachings. *The Most High Mystic Capital’s Wondrous Original Purity of Body and Mind Sutra* concludes.
