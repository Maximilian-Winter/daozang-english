# 太上虚皇天尊四十九章经

**The Forty-Nine Chapters Sutra of the Supreme Void Sovereign Heavenly Worthy**

**Chapter One: Establishing Merit**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Those who seek to cultivate the Dao must first establish merit. Thus, all the Celestial Emperors, exalted deities, perfected beings, and divine immortals of the heavens have ascended to the ranks of sagely transcendence through diligent merit. The heavens record their merits and assign them ranks accordingly. When merit accumulates to a thousand, both form and spirit attain immortality. If merit falls short of a thousand, the form perishes while the spirit becomes immortal. When merit extends to the ten thousand people, one becomes a guest of the Jade Clarity. Mortals shed their forms to become immortals; immortals transform to become perfected beings. The perfected move without obstruction, merging with the natural. Dissolving, they become qi; resting, they become human. With spiritual penetrations and self-mastery, they transform without form, soaring through the Three Realms, emerging from darkness into light. When I dwelt in the world, I established merit for the world; when I roamed the heavens, the heavens reported my merit. All sentient beings, desiring deliverance, must not waver in their resolve—they will naturally attain the true Dao.

**Chapter Two: Fasting and Precepts**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Fasting and precepts are the root of the Dao and the bridge of the Dharma. If you wish to study the Dao, observe pure fasting and uphold the precepts, maintaining right mindfulness in every thought—then delusion and falsehood will naturally vanish. All sentient beings abandon the realm of purity, indulging in the stench of meat and fish, thereby violating the Dharma. They are like hungry ghosts devouring corpses, their bellies ablaze with hunger, never sated. Or like flies swarming over filth, mistaking foulness for fragrance, thus violating the Dharma. The Three Palaces are defiled, the Six Viscera impure; the corpse-soul thrives, delighting in the realm of death. You must sever the roots of desire, enter the realm of purity, refrain from all suffering, commit no evil, generate no views, and arouse no perversity. Regard the precepts as the laws of the world—if you contemplate transgression, fear the punishments of metal and wood. Hold the precepts with utmost sincerity, standing in awe as if facing something dreadful. Maintain a solemn and upright mind, extinguish all thoughts, listen single-mindedly without duality—only then may you unite with the true and become my disciple.

**Chapter Three: Recognizing the Original Nature**
The Heavenly Worthy said: The Void and the Natural are the source of the Dao. The True One is non-dual, its essence serene and luminous, self-sufficient and complete, free from all views. Distant from the dust and defilements, learning is no-learning, cultivation is no-cultivation—within this, all is clearly understood. Neither departing nor abiding, neither grasping nor rejecting, neither joyful nor afflicted, neither dying nor living, neither past nor present—this is true awakening. Observe all forms and appearances as equal to emptiness; extinguish worldly illusions and merge with the natural.

**Chapter Four: Responding with Virtue**
The Heavenly Worthy said: If a person has one virtue, a hundred spirits are at peace. If one has ten virtues, the Registrar of Life records their years. If one has a hundred virtues, the Eastern Florescence inscribes their name. If one has a thousand virtues, blessings extend to the seven ancestors, and the deceased souls become immortals. When ten thousand virtues are complete, a jade talisman descends to welcome them, a thousand spirits pay homage, and they ascend to the celestial court in broad daylight.

**Chapter Five: The Dharma’s Power to Protect**
The Heavenly Worthy said: You pity others but cannot pity yourself. Earth, water, fire, and wind—these Four Great Elements combine temporarily. Clay is molded into a vessel and fired to become firm. Your body is like the vessel; the Dharma is like the fire. It can protect your body, forming an indestructible essence.

**Chapter Six: Accumulating Virtue as Treasure**
The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Wondrous Practice Perfected One: When you ascend a mountain of treasures, walking left and right, myriad treasures lie scattered, all lovely to behold. As you descend the mountain, can you bear to carry none away?
The Wondrous Practice Perfected One replied: To return empty-handed is to abandon oneself.
The Heavenly Worthy said: Well said! Human life in the world is like dwelling on a mountain of treasures—all manner of good affinities are treasures. If you do not cultivate goodness, when you depart this world, it is like ascending that mountain of treasures and returning empty-handed, carrying nothing. Will you have no regrets later?

**Chapter Seven: Removing Defilements**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Your form is impure, subject to all attachments. When defilements accumulate in the body, you must seek gradual purification. If the mind’s defilements are unclean, the six senses become tainted. Failing to cleanse them is delusion. Thus, when the body’s defilements are unclean, they are washed with worldly water; when the mind’s defilements are unclean, they are washed with the Dharma’s words. When the six senses are pure, inside and out become luminously clear, without the slightest contamination—only then may you attain the formless.

**Chapter Eight: Tasting the Dao**
The Heavenly Worthy said: When you eat honey, your entire mouth is sweet, and the flavor lingers on your tongue. The taste of my words surpasses this.

**Chapter Nine: Severing Causes and Conditions**
The Heavenly Worthy said: All sentient beings arise from causes and give rise to causes, arise from conditions and give rise to conditions. Due to causes and conditions, they bind themselves in afflictions, create immeasurable karma, and fall into birth and death, endlessly revolving. Like bubbles in waves, they form and dissolve repeatedly. You must awaken to the fact that all is originally empty. You yourself generate views, cling to everything, and all manner of attachments become the roots of affliction, equal to a prison. If this mind does not awaken, it is like a great criminal, bound since beginningless time, with no liberation. Now, I extinguish your past and future causes, sever all conditions, recognize causes as non-causes, conditions as non-conditions. Neither caused nor conditioned, serene and eternally still, without going or coming, without separation or attachment—all is liberated, transcending the Three Realms.

**Chapter Ten: Renewing Oneself**
The Heavenly Worthy said: All men and women, bowing their heads before the Three Treasures and taking refuge, wash away defilements to purify the mind-ground. Repenting past transgressions and renewing themselves, they vow never to repeat them—such may become my disciples.

**Chapter Eleven: Almsgiving**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Those men and women who, since dwelling in the world, inwardly reflect before the Three Treasures and find nothing to repent—these are my true disciples.

**Chapter Eleven: Almsgiving**
The Heavenly Worthy said: To give from abundance is not difficult; to give when lacking is difficult. To give what one does not desire is not difficult; to give what one deeply cherishes is difficult. All blessings arise from joy; all almsgiving is born of a joyful heart. All wealth and treasures belong to the lives of beings. Some give material goods, dedicating them to the Three Treasures; some give the Dharma, awakening all beings. The manifold good fruits bring boundless karmic reward.

**Chapter Twelve: Diligence**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Those who know my Dao yet fail to practice it; those who practice my Dao yet cannot persist—rare indeed is one who attains the Dao, who knows and yet is diligent, who endures without slackening. Like crossing the vast sea, daily seeking the shore, steadfast from beginning to end, the Dao shall be yours.

**Chapter Thirteen: Refining the Impure into the Real**
The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, saying: Before you were born, in undifferentiated chaos, fundamentally nothing existed—sight and hearing were unattainable, yet you merged with the true and constant, without name or form. What then was wondrous conduct? Now I shall expound for you the principle of the unborn. All forms and appearances are but illusory and false; clinging to this illusory body becomes a burden to me.

Just as forging a sword—smelting away dross and impurity—only then does refined steel appear; fierce and unyielding, it becomes a wondrous instrument.

**Chapter Fourteen: Transforming and Evolving**
The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, saying: Those who follow my Dao engage in virtuous action; those who depart from my Dao engage in evil action. The Most High establishes virtue, next establishes merit, and next establishes teachings. Though their accomplishments differ in degree, all return to the Dao. All sentient beings, deluded by inverted false thoughts, create karmic deeds leading to hell, unaware of their own plight, eagerly rushing forward to plunge into the river of desire. You, for the sake of sentient beings, expound the teachings, employing skillful means to guide them—thus shall you gain blessed retribution and together realize the unconditioned.

**Chapter Fifteen: Attaining True Perfection**
The Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct asked the Heavenly Worthy: What is called a true person? And what Dao must one cultivate to attain this fruition?
The Heavenly Worthy replied: With concentrated mind and ascetic practice, renounce worldly desires, cease false thoughts, and remain unstained. Refine form to transform into qi, refine qi to transform into spirit, refine spirit to merge with the Dao, and embody spontaneity. Gather the myriad dharmas into one body, and with that one body transform the myriad realms. Unattached to existence or nonexistence, forever transcending birth and death—this is called a true person.

**Chapter Sixteen: The Three Vehicles and Their Distinctions**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Those of lesser learning restrain their eyes from reckless seeing, their ears from reckless hearing, their minds from reckless knowing, and suppress all things to extinguish the myriad states in order to attain the Dao. Those of profound learning see yet perceive nothing, hear yet apprehend nothing, know yet cognize nothing, act without pursuit, thus observing the wondrous. Those of the Great Vehicle, though seeing nothing, miss nothing; though hearing nothing, miss nothing; though knowing nothing, miss nothing. Within and without, all is luminously clear, penetrating the unobstructed—thus they partake of the cosmos and roam the boundless realm.

**Chapter Seventeen: Exhorting Goodness Through Words**
The Heavenly Worthy said: To give another wealth is not as good as giving them good words.

**Chapter Seventeen: Exhorting Goodness Through Words (continued)**
Though gold be precious, its use will exhaust it; good words treasured in the heart remain a lifelong jewel. All divine immortals and perfected beings attained the fruit of the Dao through these supreme and essential words. If you can uphold and widely proclaim this teaching to all beings, enabling them to practice it, their merit will be boundless.

**Chapter Eighteen: Suffering and Joy in Sequence**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Those who study the Dao sever all attachments and desires, forsake rich and savory foods, maintain long fasts and pure contemplation, and savor the profound Dao—this is seeking joy within suffering. If one knows its joy, one perceives no suffering. All sentient beings, clinging to glory and splendor, deluded by sounds and sights, indulge their passions and pursue pleasures—yet these are the very causes of suffering. My Dao brings suffering first, then joy; sentient beings know joy first, then suffering. I now tell you this: be clear and cautious.

**Chapter Nineteen: The Non-Dual Gate**
The Heavenly Worthy said: My Dao makes no distinction of near or far; my gaze sees no high or low. All sentient beings are viewed with equal regard. Those with a nature for goodness, I aid in perfecting their goodness; those with a nature for the Dao, I aid in realizing their Dao. If there is any partiality, it is a dual gate.

**Chapter Twenty: Non-Killing**
The Heavenly Worthy said: If you wish to study my Dao, be ever mindful not to harbor thoughts of killing. All sentient beings cherish life and fear death. My life is their life—do not treat theirs lightly. The mouth delights in rich flavors, yet slaughter fills the feast. If you hold a heart of compassion, imagining their terror, then you will refrain from eating them, thus embodying the practice of mercy and kindness.

**Chapter Twenty-One: Purity**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Those who study the Dao take purity as their foundation. They maintain long fasts and subtle contemplation, chanting the Great Void, regarding all deviant paths as enemies; they shun all desires as if avoiding foul stench. By uprooting the sources of suffering and severing the bonds of attachment, they emerge from the murky sea to attain a realm of purity—like the white lotus rising from the mire, unsullied by the water. With the five viscera cleansed and the three fields radiant, the Perfected of the Great Mystery will naturally draw near.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: Non-Deception**
The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, saying: The Great Vehicle can transcend the Three Realms. If one does not practice my Dao, it is to deem me false. I attained this through non-deception. Thus, faith is the treasure of the heart; all perfected beings realized the fruit of the Dao through the power of faith.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Compassion**
The Heavenly Worthy said: You, all beings, take compassion as your foundation. When seeing any creature, always act with forbearance. The suffering of worldly people is as if it were your own; you should vow to save and protect them, bringing universal peace and happiness. All sentient beings, through ignorance, fall into sin and suffering. If you do not rescue them, you are equally ignorant. By constantly practicing the heart of great compassion, you will perfect the supreme Dao.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Myriad Dharmas Return to One**
The Heavenly Worthy said: A thousand streams and branches flow into the sea; the myriad dharmas, though diverse, return to the Dao. Sentient beings, through attachment, create distinctions. There should be perfect comprehension without obstruction, a single thread running through all meanings.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: Severing Defilement**
The Heavenly Worthy said: All sentient beings arise from defilement and return to defilement. If one can purely believe my precepts, remain unstained, and sever distracting thoughts, one will escape the waves of impurity, enter my Dharma-gate, and transcend the cycle of birth and death, forever beyond the dust of kalpas.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: Washing the Heart**
The Heavenly Worthy said: If the six senses are impure, wash the heart. When the heart does not receive filth, all defilements vanish. Thus, the heart is the sovereign, governing all. To subdue the heart is like taming a fierce tiger; if you indulge it, it will turn and harm you.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Realizing the Real**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Those who study the Dao are serene and receptive. They do not merely rescue the imperiled or aid the distressed but extend kindness to all things, eradicating thoughts of malice. They regard all sentient beings as their kin—those who hunger or freeze, they think to clothe and feed; those who are sick, they think to heal; those entangled in enmity, they think to reconcile. Such a heart of compassion, immeasurable in its manifestations, in this life and the next, will realize the conduct of the perfected.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Wealth as the Root of Calamity**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Wealth is the root of calamity; to amass wealth is to amass karma. Wealth is the root of desire, giving rise to all sins. Only when one regards wealth as no-wealth can one enter the realm of the Dao.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Universal Moistening of Supreme Words**
The Heavenly Worthy said: All sentient beings are bound by love and attachment, as if treading upon raging fire, finding no respite from youth to old age, unaware of their plight. My words are like sweet dew, able to sprinkle all, so that their hearts may naturally attain cool clarity.

**Chapter Thirty: Forbearance**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Forbearance is the treasure of the body; be ever mindful not to contend with others. When all demons come, I conquer them through forbearance, not by competing with them. Those who come will turn their weapons back; harming others harms oneself, while I remain at peace. All perfected beings attained their state through forbearance.

**Chapter Thirty-One: Cultivating the Field of Merit**

**Chapter Thirty-One: Cultivating the Field of Merit (continued)**

The Heavenly Worthy said: A human life in this world is like a flash of lightning—swift and fleeting. From infancy to decrepit old age, it passes in the blink of an eye, as if a spring dream. If one does not boldly advance in goodness, one will later grieve for having fallen short. Those who live without sowing the field of merit—what will they rely upon when their eyes close in death?

**Chapter Thirty-Two: Right Mindfulness**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Let your mind be free of perverse thoughts; a single thought pierces the empty sky. Within all the emptiness of space, there are sages and worthies. Always maintain the vision of equality, diligently cultivate the supreme practice, and you will naturally perceive the Eternal Venerable One. With time, you will enter the Great Vehicle.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: Transcending Being and Non-Being**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Sentient beings, deluded and confused, falsely perceive existence. The Dao is fundamentally non-being, yet sentient beings, in their inversion, falsely perceive non-existence. The Dao is also beyond this—neither being nor non-being, yet both being and non-being. Those who comprehend this can transcend all.

**Chapter Thirty-Four: Bestowing Words Without Fault**
The Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct asked the Heavenly Worthy: What kind of almsgiving yields the greatest merit?
The Heavenly Worthy said: To bestow my words upon others yields the greatest merit.
The Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct asked: What is the most precious thing in this world?
The Heavenly Worthy said: To bear no fault in one’s person—this is the supreme treasure.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: Receiving Karmic Retribution According to Conditions**
The Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct asked the Heavenly Worthy: Can past-life causes and conditions be known?
The Heavenly Worthy said: If you contemplate the causes and conditions of this present life, you will know those of past lives. If you cultivate the causes and conditions of this present life, you will know those of future lives.
The qi is impartial and vast; what you sow, you shall reap.
If you plant the roots of thorns, how can you hope for a flourishing grove?

**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Power of Great Strength**
The Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct asked the Heavenly Worthy: What power in the world is greatest?
The Heavenly Worthy said: The power of compassion is the most vast.
The heart of compassion can transform all; the practice of compassion can subdue all.
Do not contend with the wicked, nor oppose the violent.
Wherever it turns, it is invincible—such is its power, boundless and immeasurable.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Accord with the Dao**
The Heavenly Worthy said to the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct: If you wish to learn my Dao, let your mouth be free of words of right and wrong, your mind free of the marks of self and others, and your body free of defilement and attachment. Only then can you accord with the Dao of non-action.
All sentient beings are but illusions, fallen into the causes of form.
Though they know pleasure is suffering, a single thought can realize non-being.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Arising of Sorrow and Joy in the Mind**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Do not harbor a mind that brings calamity, harming all beings.
Though sentient beings may not yet perceive it, the divine spirits already know.
To endanger others is to endanger oneself; to wrong others is to wrong oneself.
Heaven and hell—all are created by the mind.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Dharma of the Dao**

My Dao is like a torch’s flame—take from it endlessly, and as you share it, it can cook and ripen all things. My Dharma is like a spring’s source—it can irrigate the withered and parched, moistening all things.

Your body’s hindrances and afflictions set you apart from the Dao.

**Chapter Forty: Entering the Wondrous**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Those who enter my Dharma-gate study until there is nothing left to study, practice until there is nothing left to practice, and realize until there is nothing left to realize—this is called entering the gate of all wonders, seeing without obstruction.

Sentient beings cling and deludedly seek beginnings and ends, claiming to have attained the supreme. This is like falsely perceiving forms.

**Chapter Forty-One: Casting Off Ornament**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Purity is the root of the Dao; ornament is the Dao’s calamity. Do not despise plainness, for within it lies the highest flavor. The foolish, infatuated with worldly desires, are like moths drawn to firelight—unaware of the harm until they perish.

**Chapter Forty-Two: Shared Likes and Dislikes**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Beware of deceit and delusion, misleading sentient beings. Do not harbor malicious intent or scheme in secret. Compare others to yourself—likes and dislikes are fundamentally no different. Those who can hold this thought may attain the supreme Dao.

**Chapter Forty-Three: Cultivate Substance Before Giving**
The Wondrous Practice Perfected One asked the Heavenly Worthy: The sagely kings, by benefiting all beings and rescuing them without weariness, thought after thought in succession, thereby attained perfection. If someone can hold such a thought, should their karmic reward be without distinction?

The Heavenly Worthy said: Do not take this lightly. Diligently cultivate your practice until you inwardly perceive the source of the Dao, and naturally your giving will flow endlessly.

**Chapter Forty-Four: Transcending Form and Appearance**
The Wondrous Practice Perfected One said: The sagely kings possess seventy-two marks of wondrous appearance and bear nine-colored radiance. All heavenly immortals, upon seeing the Heavenly Worthy, praise and revere him, bowing in homage—this is the rarest and most supreme.

The Heavenly Worthy said: I am without form, yet you falsely ascribe form to me; I am without appearance, yet you falsely ascribe appearance to me. All those on the initial stage, because of their fleshly eyes, cannot see clearly. If you perceive me through nine colors and seventy-two marks, you depart from non-attachment and cling to existence, and thus cannot hear the supreme meaning.

**Chapter Forty-Five: All Rely on the Dao**
The Wondrous Practice Perfected One asked: All with eyes can see forms, but the subtlest Dharma cannot be seen.

The Heavenly Worthy said: My Dao is like the sun—its light shines universally, and through its illumination, all forms become distinguishable. Without the sun’s light, even those with eyes cannot see. Be vigilant in your practice of the Dao, and never abandon it midway.

**Chapter Forty-Six: Resolute Study of the Dao**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Those who study the Dao must not waver in their resolve. Sever worldly defilements, cut off attachments of love, make your mind like cold ashes, extinguish the raging flames, endure hardship in your practice, and disregard misfortune and peril. Like an arrow loosed, go forth without turning back—I guarantee you will attain the true Dao.

**Chapter Forty-Seven: Warnings Against Demonic Obstruction**
The Heavenly Worthy said: Studying the Dao is exceedingly difficult. Ghosts, spirits, and demon kings seek to thwart your success, desiring only your death and disliking the immortal Dao. As you near completion, heavenly immortals will come to test you. When immortals test you, they may do so with what you desire or what you do not desire, with what is difficult or what you fear—all are trials of what your mind does not comprehend and your intent does not conceive. Those who pass are commended by the heavens and welcomed by demon kings—this is called attaining the Dao.

**Chapter Forty-Eight: Turning the Mind Toward the Dao**
The Heavenly Worthy said: The superior person covets goodness; the inferior person covets wealth. All sentient beings cannot rest by day or sleep by night, ever anxious that their possessions and wealth are insufficient. If you turn your mind toward the Dao, how could you not attain it?

**Chapter Forty-Nine: Exhortation to Persevere**
The Wondrous Practice Perfected One asked: Studying the Dao is bitter, like bearing a heavy load up a mountain—should one grow weary and stop?

The Heavenly Worthy said: Press onward, and once you reach the summit, the suffering will cease. Looking down upon all things, they will appear minute and insignificant.
