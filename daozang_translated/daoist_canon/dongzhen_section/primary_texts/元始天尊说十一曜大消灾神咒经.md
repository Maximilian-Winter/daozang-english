**The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Scripture of the Eleven Luminaries’ Great Disaster-Dispelling Divine Incantations**

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning resided in the Great Brahma Heaven, upon Jade Capital Mountain, beneath the Kānaka Forest Tree. He sounded the great Dharma drum and struck the great Dharma bell, universally assembling the myriad heavens and earths of the Three Realms, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, and all the holy multitudes, to expound upon the karmic retributions of good and evil, and the causes and conditions of disasters and blessings for all sentient beings of past and future.

Thereupon, among the assembly, there was a Perfected One named Azure Net, who rose from his seat, gazed upon the Venerable Countenance, prostrated twice in reverence, knelt, and addressed him: “Your disciple has been fortunate since past lives to encounter the realms of humans and gods. I have humbly met the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassion, who has established the great Dharma bridge, broadly expounding the various causes and conditions for all beings, enabling them to awaken and universally enter the Dharma gate.

Now, observing below the sentient beings of the Desire Realm, by what causes and conditions do they, in the four seasons, suffer unjust punishments and imprisonment? Within a single lifetime, they are afflicted by lingering illnesses. Or, in the provinces and counties of their allotted regions, they encounter disasters of flood and fire, the rise of warfare, and the spread of epidemics. Your disciple has yet to comprehend this. I humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to specially open his compassion and enlighten my ignorance.”

The Heavenly Worthy, leaning upon his armrest, replied: “Excellent! Azure Net, you are able to inquire about the karmic conditions on behalf of sentient beings. Indeed, the beings of the Desire Realm revolve in the cycle of birth and death, submerged in the river of craving, solely pursuing the preservation of life. They do not cultivate the true Dao, nor do they understand the revolutions of the Five Phases and the influences of the Eleven Luminaries, which govern their disasters and blessings. For instance, when earth and fire remain in concealment, or metal and wood encroach upon one another, when Rāhu and Ketu rebel, or the sun and moon suffer eclipses, it results in the displacement of provinces and counties, calamities for the people, disasters of flood, fire, insects, and locusts, and the clash of weapons—all arise from these causes.

All sentient beings who take refuge as humans receive the transformations of yin and yang. Whether noble or base, rich or poor, though their allotted destinies differ, their disasters and blessings are one. As for emperors, kings, sovereigns, empresses, consorts, ministers, and officials, they are bound to the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, each with their respective ranks. The Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, along with the allotted regions and all the people, are governed by the influences of the sun, moon, and Five Planets.

I shall now instruct you to observe below the stellar configurations and examine their movements. If the Five Planets do not proceed in harmony and encroach upon the palaces and lodges, casting their influence upon the imperial lands and allotted regions, disasters will arise in succession, and pestilential toxins will spread, causing the death and injury of the multitudes.

Quickly commission the sculpting and painting of the forms of the Eleven Luminaries. Establish a ritual arena in a pure and undefiled place, meticulously prepare incense, flowers, lamps, and candles, and invite Daoist priests—or recite yourself *The Scripture of the Eleven Luminaries’ Great Disaster-Dispelling Divine Incantations*—for one, two, or three seven-day periods. Perform purification rites, practice the Dao, offer reverent recitations, and repent. Thereby, you will dispel celestial disasters above, safeguard and stabilize the imperial lands, eliminate toxic harms below, and deliver the multitudes. You should heed and believe in this, and in turn teach others to uphold, recite, and transmit it.”

The Perfected One of Azure Net knocked his head in reverence, prostrated twice, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “I humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to broadly expound and proclaim this.”

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy pronounced the Eleven Luminaries’ Great Disaster-Dispelling Divine Incantations:

**Incantation of the Nine Stars**
The Nine Luminaries proceed in harmony,
The Primordial Beginning wanders to and fro.
The radiance of flowery essence gleams bright,
The primordial spirits disperse and unfold.
Their flowing gaze is boundless,
Bestowing upon me their luminous splendor.
Above, they ascend to the vermilion effulgence,
Dissolving obstructions and opening the heart.
I attain to ride the flying clouds,
Ascending my body to the Purple Tenuity.
All affairs under heaven
Are made known to me beforehand.

**Incantation of the Five Planets**
The Five Planets array their radiance,
Illuminating the five directions.
Mercury dispels disasters,
The virtue of Jupiter brings prosperity.
Mars eliminates calamities,
Venus averts warfare.
Saturn guards the four quarters,
Bringing benefit and prosperity to families and states.
Names are inscribed on jade tablets,
Characters recorded in the imperial chambers.
Riding the whirlwind and fanning the light,
They soar through the great void.
Entering and exiting the unseen,
They roam and feast in the ten directions.
Five-colored clouds cover and shield,
Summoning spirits and seizing the winds.
Commanding the myriad spirits,
They protect and guard the immortal elders above.

**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of the Sun**
Gazing east toward the Fusang Palace,
I bow my head and pay homage to Yu Yi.
The sun’s cavernous bright radiance,
Vast and boundless—what thoughts arise?
I command myself to bow before its golden hue,
Awaiting the heavens and gazing upon its majestic form.
The imperial splendor and jade maidens
Descend to the terrace at this very moment.

**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of the Moon**
Looking up to survey the eight directions,
Only the moon nurtures the essence of yin.
Within it resides the Supreme Primordial Sovereign,
The Lady driving a carriage of green.
Its radiant splendor illumines the two poles,
Its blended brightness shines upon the Three Clarities.
Diligently seeking the supreme Dao,
The five colors descend to welcome me.

**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Jupiter**
The Year Star rides the virtue of wood,
Revolving and illuminating the eastern lands.
Its celestial demeanor is moist and lush,
Its true color gleams with august brightness.
Seeking blossoms, it sings of vast expanse,
Tossing waters, it chants of the chambers of mushrooms.
Through constant prayers and supplications,
Blessings naturally and perpetually grow.

**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Mars**
Its points bristle like dragons and phoenixes,
Its majestic light rebukes the ten directions.
The vermilion *gang* shines through the five nights,
The red fire flames along the three edges.
Its crystalline clarity accords with the true *qi*,
Its swords and halberds gleam with martial authority.
Its fierce and grasping nature obliterates traces,
How dare comets and broom stars stand before it?

**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Venus**
Venus ascends the clear Han,
Frost soars and gleams with pristine radiance.
Lofty and serene, it floats with auspicious splendor,
Bright and luminous, it flourishes as the Long-Lived Star.
Its keen edge can repel invaders,
Its lustrous hue often brings down armies.
Exhaustively investigating the tally of celestial reckoning,
It harmonizes with the Dao and long life.

**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Mercury**
Wondrous indeed, it accords with the five *qi*,
Vaguely glimpsed at the Gate of Chen.
Towering and majestic in the *chou* position,
The spirit lord of *ren* and *gui* governs the cavernous numen.
Its divided radiance congeals in purity,
Its subtle influences hasten to fulfill my thoughts.
With immortal songs and dances,
After a long while, it descends from the golden heavens.

**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Saturn**
Lofty heavens align with *wu* and *ji*,
From hidden lands rise layered skies.
The Five Phases honor its veiled radiance,
The Nine Lands witness its luminous glow.
Gan and Shi predict its lingering presence,
Taoist and shaman reckon its vast emptiness.
Celestial immortals bestow rain and dew,
Prostrate on earth, I bow to the void’s sway.

**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Rahu**
The divine head follows the dark path,
In profound obscurity, transcending to numinous might.
Dim and bright alternate at new and full moons,
Yang’s virtue obscures yin’s essence.
High above, it guards the Yellow Banner’s gate,
Spears and halberds gleam with frosty bells.
With devoted heart, I await abundant blessings,
Kowtowing, I chant the true scripture.

**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Ketu**
Dwelling in darkness, it manifests yin’s power,
The leopard’s tail anchors the stellar palace.
In wrath, it points to shatter mountains,
Its authority reigns over the darkened heavens.
Dragons and serpents assume monstrous forms,
Transformations arise in sudden gloom.
It bestows long life and fortune upon the host,
Exorcising calamities through reverence and awe.

**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Purple Qi**
Empowered by the Primordial Sovereign,
It embodies essence and shines in the Purple Tenuity.
Yin and yang reach their cyclic extremes,
Obscure and manifest unfold the numinous mechanism.
The jade chariot ascends the vast Han,
Golden bells tread the Dipper’s flight.
The Four Quarters follow the celestial circuit,
The Nine Lands revere heaven’s majesty.

**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Moon Comets**
The Great Yin’s light weaves jade’s warp,
Its essence and spirit nurture all beings.
Blue osmanthus and yellow blossoms assist,
Lush canopies safeguard its pristine numen.
Its hairy head divides into strange forms,
The comet’s tail may secretly traverse the heavens.
Dwelling in its course, it dispenses fortune and misfortune,
Through purification and devotion, it penetrates the profound void.

**Threefold Hymn of Praise**
Wondrous indeed, the resonance of the Three Caverns,
Vast and clear, how it rings!
Seeking its sound, it seems as if nothing exists,
Yet in motion, its form remains unseen.
Its echoing tone pervades the ten directions,
Yet when heard, no sound is perceived.

**Again**
The Great Dao requires human propagation,
Free the mind to return to the Great Void.
At dawn, pay homage and traverse the ten directions,
Ascend and transcend upon the Nine Dragons.
Soaring beyond the Three Realms,
One is exalted amidst the clouds.

**Again**
My master is the Heavenly Honored One,
Transcendent, the Supreme Emperor.
Gazing upward beyond earth’s bounds,
Dimly glimpsed is the Purple Flame Hall.
Towering is the Chamber of Mystery,
Where only the abodes of immortals are seen.

The Heavenly Honored One addressed the Perfected Lord of Azure Net: "These incantations of the various spirits, if recited with sincere devotion, will ensure the stars move in harmony, illnesses vanish, the state enjoys peace, and the people thrive in the Dao."

The Perfected Lord of Azure Net kowtowed and bowed again, and all the assembled immortals, upon hearing the scripture and incantations, rejoiced greatly, paid their respects, and withdrew.

Thereupon, the Perfected Lord of Azure Net transmitted these teachings to the world, exhaustively investigating the celestial reckoning, faithfully receiving and practicing them.
