At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded this *True Scripture of Sin Eradication*, addressing the celestial and terrestrial deities. The merit of fasting and offerings is boundless. Summoning the gods of heaven and earth, the lords of Fengdu, the officials of the Six Palaces, the Four Illuminated Lords, the ten underworld magistrates of the Ten Courts, the prefects of the Five Sacred Mountains, the city gods of the Nine Provinces, the Registrars of Life and Deeds, and the Great Gods of the Five Paths, they assembled before the Heavenly Worthy, bowing in reverence to receive his commandments.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "In the karmic retributions to come, all sentient beings are under the dominion of the Great Demon King. Those who commit the Ten Evils and Five Heinous Crimes are bound in prisons, suffering day and night, with no means of deliverance. If one observes the Ten Assemblies, the merit recorded in the Mirror of Karma will be acknowledged. The Great Emperor of Fengdu, rejoicing, will release the sinners. Thus, after forty-nine days of fasting, one must prepare a memorial and present it. The Divine Lads of the Six Bureaus will inscribe it in the Jade Calendar, and the deceased shall be reborn in a place of bliss. If the merit of the Ten Assemblies is cultivated—vast as the sea—and grand Daoist altars are established to repay the profound kindness of parents, all shall ascend to the Pure Realm."

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy proclaimed the names of the Ten Kings and the merits of the Ten Assemblies, leaving them to be transmitted in the world to enlighten the ignorant:

1. **First Seven (Qī):** Great King Qin Guang, the Perfected Lord of Primordial Wondrous Vastness.
2. **Second Seven (Qī):** Great King Chu Jiang, the Perfected Lord of Yin Virtue and Settled Repose.
3. **Third Seven (Qī):** Great King Song Di, the Perfected Lord of Penetrating Clarity and Universal Stillness.
4. **Fourth Seven (Qī):** Great King of the Five Offices, the Perfected Lord of Mysterious Virtue and Fivefold Numinosity.
5. **Fifth Seven (Qī):** Great King Yama, the Perfected Lord of Supreme Radiant Numinosity.
6. **Sixth Seven (Qī):** Great King Bian Cheng, the Perfected Lord of Precious Solemnity and Illustrious Completion.
7. **Seventh Seven (Qī):** Great King of Mount Tai, the Perfected Lord of Equal Contemplation and Illuminated Principle.
8. **Hundredth Day:** Great King of Equality, the Perfected Lord of Unsurpassed Right Deliverance.
9. **First Anniversary:** Great King of the Capital, the Perfected Lord of Flying Demons and Manifested Celebration.
10. **Second Anniversary:** Great King of the Turning Wheel, the Perfected Lord of Fivefold Transformations and Majestic Virtue.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "When the parents and kin of sentient beings perish and descend into hell, if their descendants cultivate merit and hold virtuous assemblies, the deceased souls may be reborn in heaven, avoiding the evil destinies. Let this be transmitted throughout the realm. Those who follow these teachings to deliver the dead shall spare them from hell. If one practices the Daoist teachings, the merit is boundless. According to the weight of their sins, each receives their due retribution. Those who commit grave evils and perform no good deeds shall, after death, be cast into the Twenty-Four Hells and examined according to the law:

1. **Heaven-Monitoring Hell**
2. **Heaven-Leveling Hell**
3. **Nine Heavens Hell**
4. **Statute Hell**
5. **Clear and Cold Hell**
6. **Immeasurable Hell**
7. **Great Perfected Hell**
8. **Three-Six Hell**
9. **Heavenly Yi Hell**
10. **Black Kalpa Hell**
11. **Female Azure Hell**
12. **Torture Hell**
13. **Knife Mountain Hell**
14. **Sword Tree Hell**
15. **Bronze Pillar Hell**
16. **Thorn Forest Hell**
17. **Fire Mountain Hell**
18. **Furnace Hell**
19. **Molten Bronze Hell**
20. **Saw Hell**
21. **Stone Gorge Hell**
22. **Freezing Ice Hell**
23. **River Earl Hell**
24. **Blazing Fire Hell**

The Heavenly Worthy proclaimed: "When the people of the world die, if their sons and daughters cultivate merit, invite Daoist priests to welcome the Perfected, abundantly arrange incense, flowers, banners, and images, recite scriptures to relieve suffering, perform circumambulations, and hold fasts, then the souls of the deceased shall not pass through the Ten Sufferings and Eight Difficulties of hell. They shall transcend the Sea of Suffering, no longer lingering in delusion, naturally awakening and ascending in due order, escaping the bitter destinies. With wholehearted devotion, receive and uphold these teachings."
