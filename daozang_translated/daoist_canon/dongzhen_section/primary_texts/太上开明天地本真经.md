**The Supreme Scripture on Revealing the Original Truth of Heaven and Earth**

**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Scripture on Revealing the Original Truth of Heaven and Earth*
**Originally Transmitted by:** Master Shou of Tongxuan Three Teachings of Meishan

The Great Dao is the original truth.
Truth is the root of the Dao, and scriptures convey its true workings.
The scripture of Heaven and Earth reveals the truth of ascent and descent;
The workings of sages and worthies return to the true and numinous.
The original true countenance is the manifest body of the Great Dao.

Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, it has followed the Dao of the sun and moon, yin and yang.
It fixes cold and heat, reveals brightness and obscurity, emits the Three Lights, and nurtures the myriad things.
It displays the virtue of the Three Great Sages and embodies the transformative power of the Two Modes.
It illuminates celestial patterns, divides terrestrial principles, completes the world, establishes the multitudes, designs the trigrams, and institutes laws and systems.
Humans created writing and tallies to clarify the Dao, governing by knotted cords to found states and families.
They drilled wood to make fire, transforming the raw into the cooked.
They distinguished herbs to cure illness and taught sowing to sustain life.
They fashioned clothing to cover and nourish the body and crafted tools for timely use.
They built palaces to shelter from wind and rain and made boats to cross rivers and streams.

When people were pure and simple, they embodied benevolence and longevity, cultivating the constant truth so that the Dao shone without obscurity.
Thus, a thousand worthies and ten thousand sages emerged, ascending and transforming through numinous understanding.
Yet as intelligence multiplied and ferocity grew, states contended in strength.
Greed for sensual pleasures led to rebellion and excess, giving rise to rise and fall, and the loss of original truth.
They defied the Dao of Heaven and Earth and turned against the brightness of the sun and moon.
Muddled and confused, they sank into turbidity and depravity;
Generation after generation, obstinacy and malice accumulated.
They forgot the principles of reason and disrupted the order of governance.
Human lifespans waned, and the world fell into chaos and desolation.

Thus, punishments and prisons were established to govern and pacify, and state laws were instituted to this day.
In ancient times, the supreme sages descended to the world, enlightening and delivering people.
Thereupon, the mechanism of the Three Teachings arose, reopening the Dao of the One Truth.
Confucianism embodies the ceaseless activity of Heaven and Earth, the Dao of one yin and one yang—
Heaven’s constancy, Earth’s righteousness, the people’s conduct, filial piety’s rites.
It governs by modeling these, cultivating the self and moderating use, not losing the original truth or abandoning the Middle Way.
It penetrates the Five Constants, practices the Four Virtues, understands life and death, and expounds on daily harmony.
Joy without excess, sorrow without harm.
Fulfillment is called beauty; radiance and greatness make one a sage.

Daoism embodies the wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth, the Dao of one water and one fire—
The sun’s spirit and the moon’s essence, inner yin and outer yang, returning to life and reverting to the source.
It seizes the transformative power of Heaven and Earth, practicing the work of fire and timing.
It nurtures and completes the elixir, ascending together to immortality.
Those who do not lose their place endure; those who die yet do not perish are long-lived.
With the original truth firm and secure, one attains the Dao and longevity.

Buddhism embodies the great workings of Heaven and Earth, the Dao of one provisional and one real—
Adapting to circumstances in engaging the world, perceiving form and illuminating emptiness.
It presses into the Middle Way between existence and nonexistence, refining practice to realize wondrous form.
It completes emptiness and together enters non-arising.
Through forbearance and transcendence, merit is accomplished.
With the great samādhi of *nāga*, it returns to the root and reverts to the source; with the true suchness of reality, the numinous eye shines forth.
It penetrates Heaven and Earth, realizing sagehood and becoming true.

Thus, each of the Three Teachings exalts its own honor, yet the root of the Dao is one.
Life comes from the original truth; death departs through the original truth.
Attaining truth is not a matter of male or female; illuminating the Dao has no coming or going.
Confucianism cultivates the root, not falling into excess, harmonizing with the virtue of Heaven and Earth.
Daoism guards the root, nurturing as its work, containing the transformations of Heaven and Earth.
Buddhism returns to the root, clearly realizing the true return, transcending beyond Heaven and Earth.

Yet now the Three Teachings, though mingled in the One Truth, speak of cultivating the root while indulging in wayward thoughts and excess, lacking the careful measure of restraint;
They boast of guarding the root while straying into side doors and losing nurturance, devoid of the true mystery of fire and timing;
They speak of returning to the root while deluded by false thoughts and swept away by currents, lacking the wondrous method of refined practice.

Now, we of the Three Teachings, in their interpenetration, point directly in many ways, compassionately pitying life and death, and revealing the truth of Heaven and Earth.
The nature of Heaven is the Heaven beyond Heaven;
The heart of Earth is the Earth that does not move.
It operates the great Dao of Heaven and Earth and conveys the great root of Heaven and Earth.
It announces to Heaven and prays for longevity, protecting the state and pacifying the people.
All return to the original body, universally delivering the karmically bound and the kin.
The deceased attain transformation; the living achieve numinous understanding.
No demons can harm them; no illnesses can invade.

Yet without circulating the true scripture of the hidden eye, one cannot obtain the true root;
Without reverting to the original source of the root, one cannot cultivate and nurture;
Without nurturing life and preserving destiny, one cannot attain numinous clarity;
Without stillness and illumination embracing emptiness, one cannot see the nature;
Without awakening to the nature’s perfect constancy, one cannot penetrate thoroughly;
Without penetrating the mysterious and awakening fully, one cannot return to truth.
Vainly seeking to become buddhas or immortals, one cannot transcend the mundane and enter sagehood.

Above all, one must worry over the great matter of life and death, without distinction of self and others or division among the Three Teachings.
Seek the perfected person, point to the scriptural methods, illuminate this root, and return to the One Truth.
In daily practice, what does one cultivate?
From the original source, what does one attain?
In true nature, what does one perceive?
On the path ahead, to what does one return?

If one thus understands and penetrates clearly, one will realize neither immortality nor buddhahood.
One will fully transcend the realm of sages and instantly penetrate past and present.

I exhort the followers of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism, the faithful and the virtuous:
If you uphold and circulate this scripture, you will swiftly attain penetration and benefit;
If you refine practice and awaken to understanding, you will immediately realize non-arising.
It surpasses the external paths and all scriptures, excelling the turning of a single canon of the Tathāgata.
Do not vainly recite it ten thousand times; gather it into the radiant One Truth.
The meaning of the scripture, the method of the scripture, the secret of the scripture—
Neither inner nor outer, neither mind nor beyond.
Understanding the true scripture is not this scripture; obtaining the true root is not this root.

You should know that the true scripture of the Great Dao depends on oral transmission and heart-to-heart seal,
Following the method of secret transmission, and joyfully practicing it.

The Supreme Scripture on the Dao of Sealing the Luminous and Returning to the Root of Heaven and Earth is hereby complete.
