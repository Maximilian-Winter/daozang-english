# 上清黄气阳精三道愿行经藏月隐日经

**The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Yellow Qi and the Three Yang Essence Circuits**

**Scripture Title:** *The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Yellow Qi and the Three Yang Essence Circuits*, also known as *The Hidden Heaven and Concealed Moon*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. A foundational scripture of the early Shangqing tradition. One scroll. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Benwen* category.

The Supreme Lord of the Southern Ultimate and Upper Primordial said: I have received the essentials of the Highest’s Three Circuits in Sequence, the Dao of the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence. By ingesting numinous radiance, sipping the imperial blossoms, and gazing upon the soaring roots, I store the Seven Luminaries within the Purple Effulgence, traverse the Three Paths at the Golden Gate, fathom the vast and narrow within the Abyssal Radiance, discern the square and round of the sun and moon, behold the Vermilion Stairs in the Cavernous Yang, enter to refine the intestines in the Broad Cold, ascend the Seven Treasures at the Dark Garden, climb the Flying Ladder at the Numinous Pass, return the Yang Essence to the Floating Black, gather the Yellow Qi from the Yüshāna, roam beside the Golden Wings on the Lofty Tree, and pass through the Stone Radiance to illumine the countenance. Through cultivating and mastering the numinous diagrams, I thus summoned the divine perfected ones. Thereupon, the Three Effulgences cast their light, the Seven Essences flanked my chariot, the Five Numinous Ones girded me with their sashes, the Four Directors composed their registers, the Western Tortoise fixed the records, and my name was inscribed in the Highest Dawn. Thus, I ascended to the rank of the Supreme Lord of the Southern Ultimate and Upper Primordial.

This Dao is lofty and wondrous, not something that mediocre men or narrow scholars may discuss. Now, I compile what I have received and roughly expound the Highest Jade Emperor’s arcane words to mark the mysterious and spontaneous numinous script, entrusting it to the Upper Minister, the Azure Lad, who oversees the records of the Mysterious Palace. After ten thousand kalpas, it shall be transmitted to those destined to receive the Mysterious Record on white slips and azure registers.

Such numinous scriptures and purple texts as the *Eightfold Simplicity Perfected Scripture*, the *Purple Clouds’ Inner Contemplation*, the *Sun’s Radiance within the Mysterious*, and others each speak of their respective practices, valuing only the ingestion and mastery of them, yet they cannot encompass their great root and origin, nor expand their vastness and dispersion. This may be called grasping the branches without fathoming the root, obtaining the Dao without attaining its source. Therefore, the study must be broadly pursued, requiring the mutual completion of above and below, the cultivation from beginning to end. When the Dao is complete and qi is abundant, there is none who shall not become immortal.

The sun’s breadth spans two thousand and forty *li*. Within it, golden essence and watery essence form halos, their flowing light illuminating the exterior. Within it are cities and people, seven-jeweled bathing pools, and four kinds of lotuses—blue-green, red, yellow, and white. The people are twenty-four feet tall, clad in vermilion robes, and they flourish and wither together with the four kinds of flowers. Thus, the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, and summer—proceed therein.

The sun’s movement is governed by five winds: the Seasonal Wind, the Direct Wind, the Assisting Wind, the Revolving Door Wind, and the Traveling Wind. Therefore, the regulation and control of the sun, moon, and stars, their roaming through the void qi without cease, are all governed by the framework of these winds.

The waxing and waning of the sun and moon’s movements are all due to the convergence of the four seasons, the concealment and adornment of their crowns and sashes. Above the Golden Gate, the sun’s movement is unimpeded and luminous. Within the Golden Gate lies the pool of smelted golden essence, situated in the region of the Western Pass and Yéni. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, one receives the refinement of the hun-soul within the Golden Gate, its radiance shining without. At this time, the light and scene are gentle and fresh, the qi of all under heaven is warm, and this occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing. Each month, it naturally repeats five times, with a minor refinement of the Eight Rays above the Golden Gate, as the essentials are already detailed in the *Eightfold Simplicity Scripture*.

Proceeding in sequence to the Cavernous Yang Palace, the upper lodge of the sun, also called Líluó, situated in the region of the Floating Black. On the day of the Beginning of Summer, within the Cavernous Yang Palace, one exhales the essence of smelted gold to irrigate the palace, further refining the Eight Rays in the courtyard of flowing fire. At this time, the sunlight is dim yet intense, the yang qi overflows and scatters, and all under heaven is greatly hot. This occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.

Proceeding in sequence to above the Eastern Well, the path through which the moon’s radiance communicates, situated in the region of Lù. On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, the sun bathes in the radiant halo within the Eastern Well, gathering the qi of the Eight Simplicities and returning to the Broad Cold Palace. At this time, the celestial scene is lofty and clear, the qi of all under heaven is cool, and this occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.

Proceeding in sequence to the Broad Cold Palace, the upper lodge of the moon, the floral canopy of the Seven Stars, situated at the boundary of Yüshāna. On the day of the Beginning of Winter, the sun’s essence is concealed within the Broad Cold Palace, where it dons its crown and sash to nurture the embryo. At this time, the sunlight is yin, and all under heaven is cold. This occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.

In one year, the sun’s movement completes its circuit, donning its crown and sash in the four directions, totaling one hundred and eighty days. These are the regions the sun traverses, while the remaining one hundred and eighty days belong to the moon’s movement. The two luminaries separate and unite, yin and yang wax and wane, each having its allotted measure and limit.

Within the Golden Gate stands the Lofty Soaring Tree, forty thousand *li* tall, its branches extending two thousand *li*, its girth two hundred and eighty *li*, and its roots plunging eight hundred and forty *li* deep. At its summit is [a figure] who ascends to heaven. The Jade Emperor, hearing of his valor and might, commanded him to guard the north, overseeing the position of Zhenwu, to sever the demonic and evil of the world.

The Perfected One addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: How may this divine general descend to the lower realm to subdue and eliminate demonic ghosts, deliver sentient beings, and spare them from violent deaths, thereby daily increasing their blessings? I humbly beseech the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy to grant this request.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Jade Lad of the Right, who swiftly dispatched a true talisman directly to the north to summon the divine general Zhenwu. Upon receiving the summons, the general led his divine hosts directly before the Heavenly Worthy, kneeling and saying: Your servant has already received the Jade Emperor’s command to guard the north. Today, for what reason do I merit the sight of your compassionate countenance? I have been specially summoned by your talisman.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: While I was expounding the Dao in the Upper Prime Palace, suddenly the black poisonous grievance-qi of the lower realm surged upward into the celestial realm, startling the entire assembly. You should proceed there to subdue and eliminate the demonic forces, delivering and rescuing the wandering souls.

The divine general Zhenwu, respectfully receiving the Heavenly Worthy’s command, loosened his hair and went barefoot, treading upon the coiling serpent and the Eight Trigrams divine tortoise. He led his host of three hundred thousand divine generals, the Six Ding and Six Jia spirits, the Five Thunder divine soldiers, mighty dragons, lions, venomous dragons, and fierce beasts—all in procession before and behind—arriving together in the lower realm. Within seven days, the demonic forces throughout the world were all subdued and eliminated, separating humans from ghosts, dispersing vengeful souls, securing the peace of the living, and bringing tranquility to the land. The divine general Zhenwu and his assembled hosts then returned to the Upper Prime Palace and presented themselves before the Heavenly Worthy, saying: Yesterday, in obedience to your command, I descended to the lower realm to subdue and slay the demonic forces. By the power of your compassionate virtue, within seven days, all the malevolent spirits throughout the world were swept away.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Excellent! Have you and the other deities not wearied yourselves?

Thereupon, the divine general Zhenwu crossed the Qian trigram to deploy the Dipper, pointing the Big Dipper’s handle with fierce energy, aiding the Celestial Pass, and intoned this incantation:

Born of the Great Yin, essence of the Water trigram,
Corresponding above to the Void and Danger constellations,
Tortoise and serpent unite in form,
Circulating through the Six Directions, might subduing the ten thousand spirits,
No darkness unperceived, no wish unfulfilled,
At kalpa’s end and kalpa’s dawn, severing and vanquishing demonic essences,
Rescuing and protecting all beings, bringing peace to households and nations.
When in the cycle the final Jia day arrives and demonic qi flows,
The Supreme Emperor issues his decree—
I descend in numinous power to propagate the true Dharma,
Dispelling evil and averting warfare, nurturing the multitudes,
Aiding the flourishing of the Middle Revival.
Should any petty demon dare manifest,
My single gaze shall topple the Five Peaks.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees!

The ritual invocation said:

In the Primordial Beginning, at the Supreme Simplicity,
No image, no form—
None knew the heavy and turbid,
Who could discern the light and pure?
Within the chaos, I divided darkness and light:
Heaven attained its vigor,
Earth attained its tranquility,
The people attained their nurturance,
All things attained their sprouting,
The perverse attained rectification,
The spirits attained their numinosity.
Within the Three Powers, the myriad kinds all flourished.

When the Great Simplicity dispersed,
Benevolence and righteousness arose;
When rites and music were established,
Deceit and perversity spread.
The Six Relations were at times forsaken,
The Four Peoples contended.
Above, there was no magnanimity or forgiveness;
Below, no loyalty or integrity.
Some were demons, some ghosts,
Some goblins, some spirits—
Rampant and venomous,
They harassed and disturbed the living.
Entire households fell to illness and misfortune,
Years burdened by official punishments,
Wealth and goods dissipated,
Kin scattered and forlorn,
Lives cut short in vain,
Calamities entwined.
Foul and turbid qi ascended to the Celestial Court.
The Heavenly Honored One issued his decree:
To grant peace and stability,
To sever all goblins,
To boil all ghosts,
To bind the officers of pestilence in submission,
To extinguish the clarity of demonic spirits,
To topple and crush perverse demons.

I command one hundred thousand mighty warriors,
Fifty million soldiers—
Above and below, in heaven and on earth,
They traverse twenty-four hundred *li*,
Encircling two hundred eighty *li*,
Their roots delving eight hundred forty *li* deep.
Those who partake of their fruit
Assume the hue of golden radiance.

Above, there are golden-winged ravens,
Their wings encompassing the bounds.
Below, there is the Flowing Fire Courtyard,
Eighty myriad *li* in breadth and length.
Within it, the Eightfold Refined Spontaneous Mysterious Elixir glows with flame.
All the perfected immortals and ten thousand immortals,
On the day of the Beginning of Summer,
Gather in the Flowing Fire Courtyard,
Within the Eightfold Refined Mysterious Elixir,
To refine themselves anew,
Receiving the fresh and unobstructed countenance of the hundred spirits.

None who later seek immortality
Fail to pass through the Cavern-Yang Palace,
To receive the Eightfold Refining and ascend to heaven.
Having completed the refining,
They partake of the blossoms of the Azure Void,
And the golden-winged ravens weave their feathers into flying immortal garments,
Bestowed upon those who have undergone the refining,
To ascend the Nine-Phoenix Terrace of Jade Capital.

All advanced scholars of the Dao,
Who ingest the Way of the Sun and Moon,
On the day of the Beginning of Summer at noon,
Take eight *fen* of true pearls,
And inscribe the Eightfold Refined Elixir-Womb Jade Talisman on yellow paper.
They cast it into clear water,
Bathe facing south,
Stand before the vessel,
Knock their teeth twenty-four times,
And softly recite the incantation as in the text for the Beginning of Spring.
When finished, they draw in qi eight times and cease,
Return to their chamber to burn incense,
Mix the refined elixir with purple powder,
Enclose the powder in a sachet,
Dust their bodies with it,
Rub their hands until warm,
And wipe their faces and entire bodies.
Lying down with their heads to the south,
They knock their teeth nine times,
Close their eyes, clench their fists,
And visualize purple qi of sunlight layering upon layer,
Crowning their bodies.
They envision themselves within the sunlight’s radiance,
The sunlight’s radiance revolving around their bodies,
Ascending to the Cavern-Yang Palace,
Amidst the Azure Void’s forest,
In the Flowing Fire Courtyard.
They visualize the Perfected of the Southern Culmen, Cavern-Yang,
Whose tabooed name is Fusion-Pearl,
Eight *cun* in height,
Clad in a crimson unlined robe,
Wearing the Sun-Essence Permeating-Yang Crown,
His mouth exhaling crimson qi, billowing like flames,
To burn their bodies.
In an instant, they pluck the blossoms of the Azure Forest
And consume them.
The blossoms taste sweet,
Their bodies suffused with warmth.
They swallow qi eighty times and cease,
Then softly recite the incantation:

*"The sunlight’s radiance spreads like gauze,
Woven with the Mysterious Vault.
Flowing fire surges and swells,
Myriad streams raise their waves.
The Azure Forest is lush and verdant,
Golden wings dance in graceful motion.
Eightfold Refined Vermilion Elixir,
Fragrant mushrooms in tranquil harmony.
The Four Golden Gates stand open,
The abode of the August Person.
Numinous radiance emits its essence,
I gaze upward to sip the flying blossoms.
To the left, I grasp the Mysterious Ascent;
To the right, I spur the demons to command.
My body ascends the lofty terrace,
My gaze sweeps across the emerald expanse.
Eight Sceneries wing through the clouds,
Purple jasper and cinnabar mists.
My qi merges with the Jade Perfected,
My destiny equals the Numinous Branch.
Ever feasting in the Ninefold Mystery,
The path knows no peril or ruin."*

When the incantation is finished,
They ingest the Eightfold Refined Elixir-Womb Jade Talisman,
Swallow qi eighty times,
And swallow saliva thirty-six times before ceasing.

Practicing this Way,
When lying down at dusk,
They must begin on the day of the Beginning of Summer,
Continuing until the Beginning of Autumn.
With both palms, they rub their hearts,
Eighty times to the left and right,
Visualizing the sun within their hearts,
The moon beneath their hearts,
The radiance of sun and moon illuminating their entire bodies.
They knock their teeth twelve times
And recite the incantation:

*"At dawn, I wander the Azure Forest;
At dusk, I lodge in the Vermilion Terrace.
Flowing fire stretches ten thousand rods,
I receive the Jade-Womb of refinement.
My hun-soul is serene, my po-soul joyful,
The myriad spirits are at ease and content.
The sun’s extremity and moon’s eternity,
The Three Luminaries align in their time."*

When the incantation is finished,
They lie down.
Practicing this for eight years,
They enter fire unscathed,
Their faces assume a vermilion complexion,
They converse face-to-face with Fusion-Pearl,
Draw down cinnabar mists,
And ascend in flight to the Upper Clarity.

Within the Eastern Well,
There is the Hall of Vast Numinosity,
Where grows the Triple-Blossom Lofty-Ring Tree,
Four thousand *zhang* in height,
Its branches extending two thousand *li*,
Encircling two hundred forty *li*.
Once in an eon, it produces the spontaneous blossoms of the Three Qi,
Resembling the radiance of hibiscus.
Partaking of one blossom,
One’s years equal one eon.

Above, there are golden-winged ravens,
Their wings encompassing the bounds.
Below, there is the Spring of Azure Mushrooms and Jade Nectar,
Named the Eastern Well,
Nine myriad *zhang* deep,
Nine thousand *li* in breadth and length—
The spring from which the Spirit-King of the Sunrise Valley partakes.

All the perfected immortals and myriad emperors,
On the day of the Beginning of Autumn,
Gather at the Hall of Vast Numinosity,
At the Eastern Well’s spring,
To bathe and refine themselves anew,
Receiving the unobstructed countenance of the perfected.

None who later cultivate the Dao to completion
Fail to visit the Eastern Well,
To bathe and refine themselves in the Jade Nectar’s spring,
And ascend to heaven.
Having completed the refining,
They partake of the blossoms of the Three Qi,
And the golden-winged ravens weave their feathers into flying immortal garments,
Bestowed upon those who have undergone the refining,
To ascend the Azure Palace of the Eastern Florescence.

All advanced scholars of the Dao,
Who ingest the Way of the Sun and Moon,
On the day of the Beginning of Autumn at dusk,
Take three *ge* of dragon fat (dragon bone is also excellent),
And inscribe in azure ink the Ninefold Refined Dragon Radiance Talisman on white paper.
They combine and cast them into clear water,
Bathe facing east,
Stand before the vessel,
Knock their teeth twenty-four times,
And softly recite the incantation as in the text for the Beginning of Spring.

When finished, draw in qi and swallow it nine times, then cease. Return to the chamber and burn incense. Grind dragon bone into powder and dust the body with it. Rub the face and entire body with both hands. Lie with the head to the east, knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize layers of purple qi from the sunlight descending to envelop the body. Envision oneself within the radiance of the sun, the sun’s light revolving around the body, ascending to the Hall of Vast Spirit within the Eastern Well, beneath the towering ringed trees. Visualize the Cinnabar Spirit of Lesser Yang, the Perfected One named Gou Shangzhen, nine inches in height, clad in a flying robe of azure feathers, crowned with a diadem of luminous essence. From his mouth issues forth blue qi, which showers and nourishes the body.

In a vessel of lapis lazuli, request the jade spring’s azure mushroom ointment to bathe the body. Partake of the blossoms of the Three Qi, and as the flavor proves sweet and fragrant, the body grows warm all over. Then swallow qi nine times and cease, softly reciting the incantation:

Within the jade chamber of orchid halls,
The sun’s splendor soars on high.
The Three Blossoms knit their grace,
Wondrous light brushes the dawn.
Primal Simplicity returns to truth,
Gently irrigating the jade spring.
The form dwells in Vast Spirit,
Rainbow hues reflect the crimson portico.
Cavernous Yang exhales its essence,
The Eastern Well refines the soul.
The Five Thearchs’ crowns and sashes,
Transform the countenance to golden visage,
Cheeks plump and bright,
To become a jade immortal.
Cinnabar Spirit of Lesser Yang,
Render me thus by nature.
Golden wings adorn and embellish,
Feathered robes gleam at dawn.
Suddenly ascending the void,
To sip at the root of the sun.
The body mirrors water’s clarity,
The dragon chariot’s light rejoices.
Feathered carriages come to welcome,
To ascend before the Jade Thearch.

When the incantation is complete, ingest the Ninefold Refined Dragon Radiance Talisman, swallow qi ninety times, and swallow saliva twenty-four times, then cease.

For all who practice this Way, when lying down at dusk, begin on the day of the Beginning of Autumn and continue until the Beginning of Winter. With both hands, grasp the shoulders thirty-two times each. Envision the sun within the well of the left shoulder and the moon within the well of the right shoulder, their two lights shining upon and enveloping the body. Knock the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:

Sun to the left, moon to the right,
The two luminaries oversee the spirit.
At dusk, rest in Lesser Yang,
At dawn, ascend to Jade Purity.
The Three Hun guard the chamber,
The Seven Po stabilize the form.
Myriad spirits assist and flank,
To join the luminaries in their course.

When the incantation is complete, lie down.

After practicing this for eight years, the entire body will radiate light, the face will emanate the essence of azure brilliance, and one will converse with Lesser Yang. Green carriages will descend, enabling flight through the dark void to ascend to Jade Purity.

Within the Palace of Vast Cold grows a forest of azure blossoms, towering four thousand *zhang* high. Its branches extend one thousand two hundred *li*, and its circumference spans two hundred forty *li*. Its leaves resemble bamboo but are crimson, its flowers resemble mirrors but are luminous, and its fruit resembles plums but bears no pit—this is the famed Crimson Tree with Cinnabar Fruit.

Those who eat its leaves gain longevity of ten thousand years. Those who eat its flowers share the numinosity of the sun. Those who eat its fruit feast and wander in Jade Purity.

Above, golden-winged ravens spread their wings to encircle the realm. Below lies the Pool of Vast Cold, where the naturally occurring Ninefold Refined Vast Spring flows, five myriad *li* deep and five thousand *li* in breadth.

The Supreme Thearchs and lofty immortals, the Perfected Ones, all ascend to the Palace of Vast Cold on the day of the Beginning of Winter to pluck the azure blossoms for their adornment. They approach the Pool of Vast Cold to bathe in the Vast Spring and refine their truth.

All advanced scholars of the Dao who have attained completion, as well as the seven generations of ancestors of scholars who are to ascend to the celestial halls, must pass through the Palace of Vast Cold, enter the Ninefold Refined Spring, undergo refinement, and then ascend to heaven.

After completing the refinement, they partake of the blossoms and fruit of the azure forest. The golden-winged ravens weave their feathers into flying immortal garments, bestowed upon those who have undergone refinement, to ascend to the Upper Palace of Jade Purity.

All advanced scholars of the Dao who ingest the Way of the Sun and Moon should, on the night of the Beginning of Winter at midnight, take three *ge* of mica, and inscribe in black ink the Yin Talisman of the Sun’s Essence Refined Essence on azure paper. Combine and cast them into clear water, bathe facing north, stand before the vessel, knock the teeth twelve times, and softly recite the incantation as in the text for the Beginning of Spring.

When finished, draw in qi and swallow it nine times, then cease. Return to the chamber and burn incense. Grind mica into powder and dust the body with it. Rub the face and entire body with both hands. Lie with the head to the north, knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize layers of purple qi from the sunlight descending to envelop the body in crimson. Envision oneself within the radiance of the sun, the sun’s light revolving around the body, ascending to the Palace of Vast Cold within the forest of azure blossoms, to the Pool of the Ninefold Refined Vast Spring. Visualize the Perfected One of Jade Radiance of the Yin Spirit, named Xuan Shangming, five inches and three *fen* in height, clad in a brocade robe of dark void, crowned with a diadem of luminous Yang jade. From his mouth issues forth a cloud of dark qi, which showers and nourishes the body.

In a golden tray, request the Ninefold Refined Vast Spring to bathe the body, and receive the fruit of the azure blossoms. Upon eating, the flavor is sweet, and the body grows warm all over. Then swallow qi fifty times and cease, softly reciting the incantation:

The Nine Luminaries generate radiance,
Their effulgence shines upon the dark pivot.
Vast rosy clouds rise in splendor,
The Cold Palace stretches afar.
The Four Elders’ upper abode,
Where the August Emperor roams.
The wheel of bright jade,
Five winds hasten the frame.
Nurtured in the land of cold,
Refining hardness and softness to freshness.
The Eight Qi interact,
The Four Directions intertwine.
Crown and sash now arrayed,
The sun’s essence exhales its talisman.
Crimson Tree with red fruit,
To share heaven’s repose.
Golden wings brush the feathers,
Embroidered robes gleam without end.
Dispersing mist and falling light,
To reach the Western Peak.
Golden gates and orchid chambers,
The Four Qi mutually sustain.
Dark Perfection holds the covenant,
Jade Radiance roams as one.

When the incantation is complete, ingest the Yin Talisman of the Sun’s Essence Refined Essence, swallow qi fifty times, and swallow saliva twenty times, then cease.

For those who practice this Way, when lying down at dusk, begin on the day of the Beginning of Winter and continue until the Beginning of Spring. With both hands, rub from below the navel to the Gate of Life fifty times each. Envision the sun below the navel and the moon within the Gate of Life, their two lights blending into a yellow hue, illuminating the entire body. Knock the teeth nine times and recite the incantation:

At dawn, drink from the Orchid Pool; at dusk, lodge in the Golden Chamber. Sun and moon intertwine their girdles, the Dark Shade shelters the Purple Void. The hun-soul is at peace, the po-soul is serene; the ten thousand spirits guard their abodes. The Four Perfected hold the covenant, descending in cloud-borne chariots to ascend the Golden Gates, their names inscribed in the Emperor’s register.

When the incantation is complete, lie down. Practicing this Way for eight years, the body emits wondrous radiance, a circular halo crowns the neck, illuminating the eight directions. Riding clouds, one soars aloft and ascends to heaven in broad daylight.

On this day, one receives refinement at the Golden Gate, is crowned and girdled in the Cavern of Yang, bathes in the Eastern Well, and is nurtured in the Vast Cold. Circulating through the four quarters for one hundred and eighty days, one returns above the Golden Gate.

The celestial reckoning speaks of three thousand six hundred cycles: when yang qi is obstructed and yin qi surges, the convergence of the Hundred and Six brings myriad calamities to the world, and heaven’s divisions alter their measures. The adept must follow the day’s movement, gathering yang essence to evade the Hundred and Six’s disasters.

The moon spans one thousand nine hundred *li* in breadth; its halo encircles seven thousand eight hundred and forty *li*. Within, white silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal water reflect, their one part divided into sixty, their blazing light shining without. Within it lie cities and people, as well as seven-jeweled bathing pools and forests of eight *qian* trees. The moon’s inhabitants stand one *zhang* and six *chi* tall, all clad in garments of azure hue.

From the first to the sixteenth day of the lunar month, the moon’s people gather white silver and lapis lazuli, refining them in the forge of blazing light—thus the moon waxes, its radiance bright. From the seventeenth to the twenty-ninth day, within the *qian* forests, they gather the blossoms of the Three Qi, brushing away the light of sun and moon—thus the moon wanes, its light dim.

The Dark Radiance’s movement is governed by the Five Winds, which weave its warp. Thus it regulates the sun, moon, and starry lodges, coursing through the Void without cease.

On the Autumnal Equinox, when the moon lodges above the Eastern Well, in the Hall of Vast Numinosity, one bathes in the Eastern Well’s pool to refine the moon’s hun-soul and brighten the Eightfold Clarity’s rays. On this day, the moon receives yang essence from the sun’s brilliance, exhaling yellow qi into the Jade Pool. On the Autumnal Equinox, the hosts of heaven gather the flowers of the Ring Tree to brush the light of sun and moon, and the moon pours yellow qi to anoint the countenances of heaven’s people. Thus the Autumnal Equinox is the day of heaven’s grand assembly, the time when yellow qi and yang essence intermingle and descend.

For those who seek the Dao of immortality, on the Autumnal Equinox at dawn, enter the chamber, face west, and recline or sit as desired. Close the eyes and inwardly envision the White Radiance Lady of the Moon, whose surname is [omitted] and given name [omitted]. She stands six *cun* and six *fen* tall, her hair bound in a cloud-like topknot, clad in a soaring skirt of plain brocade. Her mouth holds moonlight, which descends into the adept’s body, settling within the Gate of Life.

After a moment, the moonlight scatters into yellow qi, enveloping the entire body. The White Radiance Lady stands within the full moon, gathering the flowers of the Ring Tree and scattering them amid the yellow qi. From her mouth, she exhales yang essence—crimson in hue—which pours into the adept’s form, from within to without. Yellow and crimson qi intertwine, suffusing the entire body.

The Lady bestows upon the adept six red characters in purple script. Then draw in yellow qi thirty-six times and yang essence twenty-four times, then cease. Knock the teeth twenty-four times and recite the prayer with upturned face:

*"Azure Pool, numinous abyss,
Flying springs exhale fragrance.
Essence pours into cinnabar radiance,
Scattering blossoms in the numinous hall.
Yang descends as jade mushrooms,
Yin qi blends with yellow.
The Two Radiant Ones conceal their glow,
The Three Ways follow their course.
The Lady is crowned and girdled,
Bathed in blazing light.
With her saliva she anoints the body,
Orchid’s moisture overflows.
Red script in purple characters
Mirrors the Six Palaces.
Within, the Golden Immortal is transformed;
Without, flying dragons descend.
Jade chariots and feathered canopies,
Dark canopies soar on high.
Cloud-borne steeds come to welcome,
Four convergences, eight connections.
The Seven Luminaries and Purple Radiance
Soar through the Great Void."*

When the incantation is complete, swallow qi thirty-six times and saliva twenty-four times, then cease. Ingest the purple-script red characters.

Practicing this Way for eight years, the Lady manifests in form, speaking with the adept. The entire body emits purple and azure light, traversing the Dark Void, and the immortal ascends to heaven.

The above are the hidden sounds of the moon’s hun-soul in red characters of purple script, inscribed upon the leaves of the *qian* trees in the moon’s eastern precincts—a script of natural formation. Those who ingest these characters attain longevity of ten thousand years.

Though there are dozens of methods for practicing the Way of the Sun and Moon, these sounds are no longer transmitted. To recklessly divulge them invites the punishment of wind and blade in this life, while seven generations of ancestors are consigned to the boundless hells of ghostly retribution, suffering the Three Paths and Five Torments for ten thousand kalpas without release.

On the Autumnal Equinox at dawn, face east, inscribe the purple script in cinnabar upon paper, ingest it, knock the teeth twelve times, and softly recite the incantation:

*"Dark Radiance, bright and clear,
Purple qi, resplendent light.
Rising swiftly with the sun,
Four and six in harmony.
Without, brushing crimson blossoms;
Within, knitting the Eight Rays.
Purple Dao flows in brilliance,
My body at ease and full.
Riding the radiant chariot,
I ascend to the Emperor’s hall."*

When the incantation is complete, swallow qi twenty-four times, then cease. Again, inscribe the red characters upon purple paper and wear them at the crown of the head for three years. A purple radiance three *chi* in length will crown the head, and six Jade Maidens will attend, imparting numinous sounds. To recklessly inform three others is to die and become a ghostly official.

Only those whose names are inscribed in gold and whose characters are written in jade may transmit this to one person in a hundred years. Guard it in secrecy, and one becomes an immortal, soaring through the Upper Clarity.

On the Winter Solstice, the moon retreats to the Palace of Vast Cold. The Palace of Vast Cold is the moon’s upper abode, where at this time the moon’s hun-soul is nurtured in its pools. On this day, one receives yellow qi into the Jade Womb and exhales yang essence into the Cold Pool. The hosts of heaven, on this day, gather the blossoms of the Azure Forest to brush the light of sun and moon, and the moon pours yang essence to anoint the countenances of heaven’s people. Thus the Winter Solstice is the time when the Way’s movement treads the long path, the moment when yellow qi and yang essence receive radiance.

For those who seek the Dao of immortality, on the Winter Solstice at noon, enter the chamber, face north, and recline or sit as desired. Close the eyes and inwardly envision the Dark Radiance Lady of the Moon, whose surname is [omitted] and given name [omitted]. She stands five *cun* and five *fen* tall, her hair bound in a cloud-like topknot, clad in a soaring skirt of dark brocade. Her mouth holds moonlight, which descends into the adept’s heart.

After a moment, the moonlight scatters into yellow qi, suffusing the adept’s body. The Lady stands within the full moon, gathering blossoms from the Azure Forest and scattering them amid the yellow qi. From her mouth she exhales yang essence—red in color—which envelops the adept’s form, weaving inward to outward. The yellow and red qi intertwine, illuminating the entire body.

The Lady bestows upon the adept six purple-script cinnabar characters in secret tones. Then she guides the adept to swallow yellow qi thirty-two times and yang essence twenty-four times, then to knock the teeth twenty-four times. Looking upward, the adept recites the incantation:

Dark Yin Cold Pool, flowing springs in vast courtyards,
Flying blossoms scatter radiance, exhaling yellow and inhaling essence.
The two qi entwine, jade mushrooms sprout in emptiness,
Heavenly beings sip fragrance, the Lady lends her numinous wings.
Orchid pools surge, flowing yellow veils the dark,
Throughout the heavens, absorb radiance, descend upon my form.
Restore youth, refine countenance, reverse white to bind green,
Purple script of the Eastern Palace, cinnabar writings link names.
Winged steeds and feathered canopies, four perfected ones guard the chariot,
Bear me aloft together, ascend to Jade Clarity.

When the incantation is complete, the adept swallows qi thirty times and saliva twenty-four times, then ingests the purple-script cinnabar characters.

Practicing this Way for eight years, the Lady bestows upon the adept the Bright Moon Pendants and the cinnabar-script Dao, enabling flight through the mysterious void and ascent to Jade Clarity.

The above purple-script cinnabar characters and hidden tones of the Moon Soul are all inscribed in the Azure Forest of the moon’s northern realm, forming natural script.

August Supreme Perfected Ones and all heavenly beings, on the Winter Solstice, gather and ingest these purple-script cinnabar characters.

Those who ingest these six characters will have boundless luminous radiance suffuse their bodies, sharing the same lifespan as the heavenly beings.

This method is most solemn; it is a secret of the Celestial Lord. To recklessly divulge these numinous tones invites the trial of wind blades upon one’s body, while seven generations of ancestors will be consigned to the endless torments of ghostly servitude, enduring the three paths and five sufferings for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve.

On the Winter Solstice at noon, face north and inscribe the characters in ink upon green paper, then ingest them. Knock the teeth twelve times and softly recite the incantation:

Supporting dawn, bathing in radiance’s net,
Circular light flourishes in Jade Clarity.
Mysterious brilliance crowns the brocade union,
Great Desert mirrors the cinnabar numen.
Fragrant pearls govern hidden awakening,
Purple script intersperses azure blossoms.
August Supreme illuminates the Dao’s branches,
Mist and splendor pervade the empty brightness.
Wash me in the Yellow Qi Pool,
Rinse me with the Great Yang Essence.
Above, brush the Radiant Forest’s midst,
Looking up, sip the heavenly beings’ essence.
Soaring through layered mysteries above,
Sun and moon share the same root’s glory.

When the incantation is complete, swallow qi twenty-four times and stop.

Further, inscribe cinnabar script upon purple silk and wear it upon the head. Boundless luminous radiance will then suffuse the adept’s form, and six Jade Maidens will be granted to guard the adept’s body, along with six Jade Lads to protect the adept’s person.

To recklessly speak of these numinous tones and reveal them to three others is to be consigned to ghostly officials in death, never again to attain immortality.

Within a hundred years, if one encounters the *Golden Name Imperial Chart*, the *Green Script of Purple Clarity*, it may be transmitted to a single person. Secretly mastering it, one becomes a divine immortal, flying through the great void.

On the Spring Equinox, when the moon lodges above the Golden Gate, there lies the Gate of Communion with the Numinous. At that time, the moon refines within the Golden Essence Smelting Pool, tempered by the Stone Radiance Water Mother and adorned by the Flower Light.

On this day, yang essence is poured into the Golden Gate, and yellow qi is received into the Jade Spring. August Supreme Perfected Ones and all heavenly beings gather on this day to pluck blossoms from the *Qian* trees, brushing the light of sun and moon. The moon pours yellow qi to anoint the countenances of heaven’s people. Thus the Spring Equinox is the time when the myriad qi intermingle in harmony, when divine radiance coalesces, and when yellow qi and yang essence descend to meet.

For those who seek the Dao of immortality, on the Spring Equinox at dusk, enter the chamber, face west, and recline or sit as desired. Close the eyes and inwardly envision the Azure Radiance Lady of the Moon, whose surname is [omitted] and given name [omitted]. She stands nine *cun* tall, her hair bound in a cloud-like topknot, clad in a soaring skirt of azure brocade. Her mouth holds moonlight, which descends upon the adept’s two eyes.

After a moment, the moonlight scatters into yellow qi, suffusing the entire form. The Lady stands at the moon’s center, gathering blossoms from the *Qian* Forest and scattering them amid the yellow qi. From her mouth she exhales yang essence—red in color—which pours over the adept’s form, weaving inward to outward. The yellow and red qi intertwine, suffusing the entire body.

The Lady bestows upon the adept six purple-script cinnabar characters in secret tones. Then she guides the adept to swallow yellow qi twenty-four times and yang essence sixteen times, then to knock the teeth twenty-four times. Looking upward, the adept recites the incantation:

Eightfold smelting of the Golden Crucible,
Cinnabar Pool’s vast abyss,
Jade nectar surges,
Flowing to scatter the eight *Qian*.
Yellow qi rises in dense clouds,
Yang essence congeals as mist.
Gathering blossoms in the Orchid Court,
Flying skirts flutter in profusion.
The Lady sips fragrance,
August Supreme pours divine fluid.
Gentle radiance melts in season,
Moistening all heavens.
Cinnabar brilliance shines in eight directions,
Luminous clarity pervades.
Reflected glory curves and gleams,
Descending upon my body.
Attaining union with the Moon Soul,
Preserving numinous years forever,
Riding the void, steering the floating,
Ascending to the boundless.

When the incantation is complete, the adept swallows qi twenty-four times and saliva sixteen times, then ingests the purple-script cinnabar characters.

Practicing this Way for eight years, the Lady bestows upon the adept the true tones of the cinnabar script. Moon blossoms scatter to brush the adept’s body, and the face assumes a golden countenance, enabling flight to the Upper Clarity.

The above purple-script cinnabar characters and hidden tones of the Moon Soul are all inscribed in the *Qian* Forest of the moon’s western realm, forming natural script.

August Supreme Perfected Ones and all heavenly beings, on the Spring Equinox, gather and ingest these purple-script cinnabar characters.

Those who ingest these six characters will have flaming radiance suffuse their bodies, and the seven treasures of the moon’s jade pendants will become clearly visible.

This method is most secret; the August Supreme inscribes these tones within the Jade Chapters of the August Supreme, thus forming the Dragon Script of the Highest. To recklessly divulge these numinous tones is to consign seven generations of ancestors to punishment, to be bound in servitude to ghostly officials, to suffer the trial of wind blades, and never to attain immortality.

On the Spring Equinox at the *bu* hour, write in white on yellow paper and ingest it. Strike the teeth twelve times and softly recite the incantation:

*"Great radiance illumines the central heavens,
Bright rosy clouds adorn the golden chamber.
Jade characters array auspicious clouds,
Cinnabar script forms clustered groves.
Flying songs scatter through the vermilion forest,
In the profound vastness of the Great Desert,
Numinous tones sing of themselves,
Subtle words of the Eight Pure Palaces.
All heavens inhale golden fragrance,
Flowing essences bathe my countenance.
Spirit conjoins with the virtue of heaven and humanity,
The August Supreme descends with the Purple Youth,
Conveying me to soar through the Nine Voids,
Ascending to the Vermilion Moon Palace."*

When the incantation is complete, swallow qi twenty-four times. Then write in cinnabar above the purple script and wear it at the crown of the head. After three years, natural purple radiance will suffuse one’s form, and six Jade Maidens will be granted.

To recklessly divulge these numinous tones to three persons is to consign oneself to death at the hands of ghostly officials, to bind seven generations of ancestors in servitude, and to remain unredeemed for ten thousand kalpas.

Within a hundred years, if a Perfected One deigns to transmit this once, it is sufficient to attain divine transcendence and soar through the Highest Clarity.

On the Summer Solstice, the moon resides in the Cavern Yang Palace. The Cavern Yang Palace is the moon’s upper abode; at this time, the moon refines itself in the Flowing Fire Courtyard, smelting within the Eight Rays and growing resplendent in the Moon Soul.

On this day, infuse yellow qi into the Cavern Yang, and absorb yang essence into the Fire Palace. The Eight Pure Perfected Ones and all heavenly beings, on this day, gather from the Azure Void Forest to brush away the brilliance of the sun and moon. The moon, with yang essence, bathes the countenances of the heavenly beings.

Thus, on the Summer Solstice, when luminous qi excites yang essence, descending yin and absorbing the numinous, it is the moment when the Two Luminaries conjoin their radiance.

For those who seek the Dao of immortality: on the Summer Solstice at midnight, enter a chamber facing south, recline or sit as desired, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize the Cinnabar Radiance Lady of the Moon, whose surname is □ and given name □. Her form is eight inches and eight fen tall, her hair bound in a cascading cloud chignon, clad in a vermilion brocade flying skirt. She holds moonbeams in her mouth, descending into the Crimson Palace within one’s body.

Presently, the moonlight scatters into yellow qi. With each descent of a form, the Lady stands at the moon’s center, gathering azure void blossoms and scattering them amid the yellow qi. She exhales yang essence—yang essence is red—and bathes one’s form, from within to without. Yellow and red qi intertwine, illuminating the entire body.

The Lady bestows the six cinnabar characters of the purple script upon one’s body, then draws in yellow qi, swallowing it twenty-four times, and draws in yang essence twelve times before stopping. Strike the teeth twenty-four times and recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Flowing Fire spans ten thousand leagues,
Essence of the Cavern Yang,
Abode of Yang’s Peace,
Triple Flower Jade City.
Golden immortals shine within,
Eight Pure and Fourfold Clarity,
Nine Luminaries descend their qi,
Primal Highest Numinous Ones.
The Lady inhales fragrance,
Scatters flowers in Jade Clarity.
Cinnabar script in purple characters,
Voices conjoined with the Azure Void.
Orchid pools and jade smoothness,
Flowing through the Eight Darknesses.
Vermilion radiance veils all,
Heavenly immortals grow resplendent.
Revolving dawn’s curved brilliance,
Illuminates and oversees my form.
To share life and death with the Vermilion Moon,
Riding the void, driving the flying chariot,
Jade Maidens flank my position,
Golden Lads assist my spirit.
Kingfisher plumes light the canopy,
Ascending to the Imperial Court."*

When the incantation is complete, swallow qi twenty-four times and saliva twenty times before stopping, then ingest the cinnabar characters of the purple script.

Practicing this Dao for eight years, the Lady will bestow upon one the true script of the cinnabar script, the moon’s jade pendants, enabling one to ascend and soar to the Cavern Yang Palace.

---

The cinnabar characters of the Moon Soul’s hidden tones are all inscribed in the Azure Void Forest of the moon’s southern realm, forming natural script. The Eight Pure Perfected Ones and all heavenly beings, on the Summer Solstice, gather and ingest these cinnabar characters of the purple script.

Those who ingest these six characters will share the same age as the Eight Pure, their nape bearing a circular luminosity that illumines the ten directions.

This method is most secret; the August Supreme Eight Pure Perfected Ones inscribe these tones within the Jade Chapters of the Eight Pure, thus forming the wondrous scripture of the Highest. To recklessly divulge these numinous tones is to consign seven generations of ancestors to punishment, to be cast into the Mountain of Knives, to suffer the trial of wind blades, and never to attain immortality.

---

On the Summer Solstice at midnight, write in vermilion on white paper and ingest it. Strike the teeth twelve times and softly recite the incantation:

*"Yang essence in the cinnabar pool,
Flowing Fire and swirling winds,
Golden chariots wing the void,
Mysterious radiance brushes the heavens.
Eight Pure gather orchids,
Scatter fragrance in the Jade Court.
Azure forests hang willows,
Wind stirs the jade branches.
Cinnabar script in purple characters,
Holding elegance and flourishing splendor.
Flowing fragrance bathes the essences,
Universally moistening without bound.
To share the mysterious radiance,
Equal in brilliance to the Purple Empyrean."*

When the incantation is complete, swallow qi twenty-four times, then write in cinnabar above the purple script and wear it at the crown of the head. After three years, the radiance of the sun and moon will illuminate one’s form, and the Moon Radiance Lady will bestow the true script, granting six Jade Maidens.

To recklessly transmit this to the unworthy is to consign seven generations of ancestors to punishment, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas.

Secretly cultivating for eight years, cloud chariots will descend, and one will ascend to heaven in broad daylight, soaring through Jade Clarity.

The moon’s course circulates through the four quarters, thus it has phases of conjunction and opposition with the sun. The sun’s path is yang, the moon’s path is yin; though they revolve together, in their adornments, each resides in the four seasons.

Thus, the sun divides one hundred eighty days of yang, the moon divides one hundred eighty days of yin. Their cycles traverse three thousand six hundred degrees, and when they conjoin, yang qi excites while yin qi stagnates. When the Great Yang’s ninefold cycle completes its revolution, heaven and earth alter their lodgings, myriad plagues disperse, and evil and misfortune are eradicated.

Scholars who do not comprehend the revolutions of heaven and earth cannot escape the calamities of the Nine Yangs. Among those who accumulate learning, few attain the dragon chariot and ascend to the cloud towers. In vain do they labor in mountain caves, abstain from grains, swallow saliva, and ingest the essences of the sun and moon, yet remain ignorant of the divisions of the mysterious radiance—the vastness and narrowness of the celestial walled cities, the Seven Treasures and Vermilion Forests, the revolutions of the lodgings through the four quarters, the phases of waxing and waning.

The flying roots cannot be plucked, the imperial blossoms cannot be gathered. Yang essence will not descend, yin essence will not illumine. The Dao of the sun and moon remains distant indeed.

If one diligently seeks its root and comprehends the revolutions of the radiant degrees—knowing the celestial walled cities and earthly ruins, the Vermilion Forests and abyssal pools, the names and surnames of the Lady of the Moon—then the sun and moon will respond and descend, sparing one the arduous toil of distant seeking. Naturally, one may ride the cloud chariot and flying wheels to ascend to the gates of the sun and moon.

The purple script and cinnabar characters are bound within the spontaneous qi of the Eight Purities. The lofty and mysterious feathered chapters give life to the Eight Auspicious Forests of the moon, their characters suffused with purple radiance, gleaming brighter than the moon’s own light. The Eight Perfected of the Eight Purities and all the heavens gather the purple script and cinnabar characters from the Eight Auspicious Forests to ingest them, scattering incense to brush the light of the sun and moon. These sounds all express the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, hence they are called the "exalted texts." Those who ingest these characters will bear a golden countenance, their necks crowned with circular luminosity; the sun and moon will illumine them through and through, and they shall ascend as immortals without study. This method is most solemn, a secret of the exalted ones, not to be lightly disclosed. According to the precepts, within seven hundred years, if one bears the golden name of Eastern Florescence and the purple characters of Supreme Purity, a person of true harmony, they may receive its threefold transmission. Without such destiny, it must be sealed within the Jade Gate, never to be revealed for ten thousand kalpas.

**Eightfold Refinement: Alchemical Transmutation of the Perfected Talisman**
On the day of the Beginning of Spring, inscribe in yellow upon blue paper and cast into water for bathing. The entire body will be refined and transformed, summoning the mysterious radiance of the sun and moon and descending the Perfected into the Jade Court. Also, inscribe in yellow upon blue silk and wear it on the body for eight years to converse with the Perfected, who will descend with cloud chariots, ascending above the Golden Gate to receive refinement in the Alchemical Pool.

---

**Eightfold Refinement: Elixir Embryo Jade Talisman**
At noon on the day of the Beginning of Summer, inscribe in cinnabar upon yellow paper and cast into water for bathing. Both inner and outer will be refined and transformed, summoning the flying roots from the yang essence and drawing forth yellow qi from the Yellow Blossoms, turning the sun and moon to mysterious illumination and evoking the Perfected within the Jade Characters. Also, inscribe in cinnabar upon yellow silk and wear it on the body for eight years; the Perfected will descend to bestow the true script upon the aspirant, who shall ascend through the void to the Cavern Yang Palace.

---

**Ninefold Refinement of the Dragon Radiance Talisman**
At the hour of *bu* on the day of the Beginning of Autumn, inscribe in blue upon white paper and cast into water for bathing. The bones and marrow will be refined and transformed, summoning the mysterious radiance from the Purple Radiance, drawing the yang essence to the flying roots, and gathering the yellow qi into the Water Mother, descending the Perfected into the Purple Pavilion. Also, inscribe in blue upon white silk and wear it on the body for eight years; one’s head will bear the circular luminosity of the sun, enabling flight through the Grand Palace to ascend to the Hall of Vast Numinosity.

---

**Sun Soul: Refinement of Yin Essence Talisman**
At midnight on the day of the Beginning of Winter, inscribe in ink upon blue paper and cast into water for bathing. The blood and essence of the entire body will be refined and transformed, drawing the solar essence into the Purple Radiance, descending flying blossoms upon the Eight Auspicious Forests, refining the Five Palaces in the Jade Pool, and transporting the aspirant’s body to the Palace of Vast Cold. Also, inscribe in ink upon blue silk and wear it on the body for eight years; the body will emit golden light, the neck crowned with circular luminosity, and the Perfected will descend to bestow the true script, enabling flight through the Grand Void to ascend to the Palace of Vast Cold.

The Seven Stars lie four hundred thousand *li* from the earth, encircling seven hundred and twenty *li*, their walled cities forged of golden essence and lapis lazuli. The Seven Luminaries cast their purple radiance, illuminating their interiors—palaces where the hosts of heavenly beings and Perfected roam. The Palace of Vast Cold is their canopy. In one day and night, they complete a single revolution around the heavens, just as the wheels of the sun and moon. Within them grow Seven Treasures and Vermilion Forests. When, after settling into meditation, the initial breath of life arises, the Seven Stars receive refinement in the Palace of Vast Cold, their purple radiance gleaming brightly amidst the luminaries’ glow. At this time, the Seven Luminaries blaze and scatter, their essence streaming across the heavens, while the purple radiance emits its nectar to irrigate all the heavens. Thus, all the Perfected and Divine Immortals, without exception, gather the radiance of the Seven Luminaries and the orchids of the purple radiance.

For scholars who ingest the Dao of the sun and moon, they must cultivate the wondrous methods of the Seven Luminaries. After settling into meditation, retire to a separate chamber, burn incense, lie with the head to the north, compose the body and stabilize the spirit, abandoning all stray thoughts. Focus the mind upon the numinous, knock the teeth twenty-four times, and visualize the Seven Stars blazing brightly in the north. Envision oneself lying beneath the canopy of the Dipper amidst the Seven Stars, the light of the Seven Luminaries streaming beyond the purple radiance, crowning one’s body. One’s body rests above the purple radiance and within the Seven Luminaries, all within and without shrouded in darkness, nothing visible. After a long while, the light of the Seven Luminaries parts, transforming into seven youths, each upon a star.

The first youth is named *Shuming*, the second *Yaoling*, the third *Beiyuan*, the fourth *Baojing*, the fifth *Danying*, the sixth *Xuqing*, and the seventh *Ziying*. The seven youths emit the light of the Seven Treasures to nourish one’s body. *Shuming* emits the light of the purple radiance, *Yueling* the light of golden essence, *Beiyuan* the light of lapis lazuli, *Baojing* the light of white silver, *Danying* the light of jade essence, *Xuqing* the light of precious pearls, and *Ziying* the light of coral. The light of the Seven Treasures enters one’s body together. Then, draw in the breath forty-nine times and softly recite the incantation:

*"Golden essence congeals and transforms,
Binding the seven numinous spirits.
Purple luminaries blaze and scatter,
Vermilion radiance illumines through.
Canopy sways, wheels turn in the cold court,
Treasure light gleams, seven youths leap and dance.
Mysterious radiance emits orchids,
Fragrant mushrooms overflow.
At dusk, repose in the numinous hall;
At dawn, ascend to Jade Purity.
The jade pivot turns the path,
Purple radiance wings the form.
Feast and rein the cloud wheels,
Whip and drive the flying chariot.
Gaze upon the eight poles,
Three paths converge as one."*

After reciting, swallow saliva seven times and cease. Rise and dust the body with powdered millet, then lie down fully covered.

After seven years of such practice, the body will radiate the light of the seven treasures, and a canopy of purple radiance will perpetually crown one’s form. Then, seven jade lads will be dispatched to govern the flying cloud chariot, arriving to welcome the adept’s body and ascend to the Northern Asterism. This Dao is arcane and wondrous, cultivated only by the highest perfected; it is not transmitted to the lower world. Those who inscribe their mystical names before birth and record them in the Azure Register and Jade Scriptures shall attain this Dao. Those who succeed will become perfected transcendents, masters and patriarchs of the ten thousand immortals.

To recklessly disclose it brings blindness, mutilation, and punishment; one’s seven ancestors will be consigned to the Knife Mountain and Fire Torment, suffering through the Three Wretched Realms for ten thousand kalpas without deliverance. Scholars must be prudent and reverent, for this is the profound decree of the Four Poles—cherish it deeply.

These seven lads are the refined essences of the seven treasures, transformed into the highest perfected of the seven luminaries. To know their names is to escape death; to cultivate their method is to attain immortality. To reveal their taboo names is to invite blindness. By recalling them morning and evening, they will perpetually guard the adept’s body. Should misfortune, peril, or distress arise, strike the teeth seven times and invoke the names of the seven lads—the calamity will dissolve of itself.

This Dao must be known in solitude alone; how could one cast pearls and jade amidst filth and dust? Be prudent and guard its secrecy.

The Supreme One commanded the Four Directors, the Five Emperors, and the various Heavenly Kings to dispatch the Inspectors of Perfected Immortals, who perpetually traverse the Five Marchmounts and all renowned mountains. In the world, there are the essentials of the Three Ways—the method of the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence, and the scriptures of cinnabar writing in purple characters. Those who possess these are listed in the Eastern Flower, their names memorialized in the Golden Portal, and seven jade lads and seven jade maidens each attend the body of those who hold the scriptures.

Should one lightly divulge the numinous sounds or neglect the precious texts, the jade lads will report this, and the Five Emperors’ divine soldiers will punish them, condemning them to death and servitude amidst the Three Paths and Five Sufferings. Their seven generations of ancestors will bear the blame, and for ten thousand kalpas, there shall be no deliverance. Those who cultivate the essentials of the Three Ways must, on the third, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month—three days each month—face the light of the sun and moon. At midnight, they pay homage to the essence of the Seven Stars, bowing twice and concentrating their minds, aspiring to ascend to the radiance of the Three Luminaries and partake of the divine splendor of their countenances. After seven years of such practice, the sun and moon will respond and descend, bestowing upon them the Dao of the Divine Perfected.

If one’s name is inscribed in gold and jade and recorded in the Mysterious Chart, and one is deemed worthy of receiving this scripture, the master must observe the covenant with a fast of ninety days, or twenty-seven days, or three days. The disciple shall present seven taels of gold, forty feet of yellow silk, and thirty-two feet of blue silk, and the transmission shall proceed after the oath is sworn. Without the covenant, to lightly divulge it will subject the master to interrogation and the forfeiture of their body, while the disciple, for glimpsing the celestial perfected, will violate the covenant and suffer mutilation. Their seven generations of ancestors will incur guilt, and for three trials, there shall be no deliverance.

The celestial writings are wondrous and weighty; the cinnabar script in purple characters is most secret. Thus, it is treasured with covenantal faith and must not be lightly transmitted. Scholars who suffer this interrogation must be prudent and reverent. This numinous scripture was born within the Great Void, inscribed upon the Dark Garden above, in the shade of the Piled Stones, within the golden halls and jade chambers. The numinous text shines brilliantly, its purple characters soaring through the clouds, while three thousand divine lads and three thousand jade maidens, wielding incense, attend the divine perfected.

The Supreme Primordial Sovereign of the Southern Culmen received it from the Supreme One and cast the covenant into the Great Void, transmitting it to the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. The Celestial Emperor transmitted it to the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise, who passed it to the Emperor of the Golden Portal. The Emperor entrusted it to the Azure Lad of the Highest Minister, who was to transmit it to later scholars worthy of becoming perfected immortals. Now, one copy is sealed within the Western City Mountain.

Those who study immortality but do not cultivate this Way labor in vain to summon the perfected. They may attain only lesser immortality and escape death, but to hope to unlock the Celestial Gate and ascend to the Golden Portal shall forever remain beyond their reach. Once one masters the Three Ways and practices the Eight Refinements, even if one does not achieve ascension in broad daylight, on the day of transformation, one will naturally ascend to the Golden Gate and the palaces of the Four Quarters. There, one shall undergo further refinement in the Jade Pool, receive the feathered raiment of golden wings, and ascend to the palace of the Golden Portal.

Thus, this method is lofty and wondrous, incomparable to ordinary scriptures. Those who obtain its text shall become immortals without even practicing it. The immortals Zhonghuang, Xuanzisheng, Mo Di, Zhao Yanfu, Ning Kangbo, Peng Jian, An Qi, and Bogao, along with seven hundred others, sought the Dao and endured hardships, their devotion reaching the Jade Void. Though they soared to the cliffs of the heavens and roamed the Five Marchmounts, they did not obtain the essentials of the Three Ways and thus could not ascend within the Golden Gate or receive the protocols of the Golden Portal. Now, they ride the winds through the empty clouds, serving as charioteers for the Jade Clarity and escorts for the highest perfected—how different is this from those who, in their early studies, toil in the lower realms yet aspire to wander the Cloudy Portal?

In contrast, Su Zilin, Gu Xizi, Youyang Jun, Wang Qiao, Chisong, Huangren, and Qingzhen, from the outset of their studies, cultivated the essentials of the Three Ways—the method of the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence, and the cinnabar script in purple characters. Thus, they swiftly transcended the Three Clarities, ascended to the Palace of Azure Flower, and received the wondrous scriptures of the highest grade. They journeyed to the Golden Portal to receive their titles, attaining the rank of the highest perfected immortals of the Jade Clarity and the Four Poles. How different is this from those of mere aspiration?

The Perfected King transmitted this scripture to the Lady of the Southern Marchmount, and it is now sealed within the chamber of the Southern Grotto of the Yang Bathing Palace. Those with aspiration should diligently seek its text.

The *Scripture of the Yellow Qi, Yang Essence, and Three Ways in Sequential Practice* concludes.
