*The Scripture of the Three Officials’ Precious Invocations as Spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy*

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was in the Palace of Eight Luminaries within the Great Luo Heaven, expounding the supreme, most true, and wondrous Dao to the assembled divine kings of the heavens, the exalted and venerable sages of the sun, moon, and stars, and the boundless host of holy beings.

There was an immortal named the Barefoot Great Immortal who stepped forth from the ranks, raised his fists in reverence, and knelt to address the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Among the people of the lower realms, some suffer from floods, fires, blades, and warfare; from illness, childbirth, malevolent spirits, and demonic influences; from celestial nets and earthly snares—all manner of calamities and misfortunes. By what means may they be saved and delivered?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "All immortals who attain the Dao are recommended by the Three Officials. If the people of the lower realms but recite the precious invocations of the Three Officials, they will be able to dispel calamities and misfortunes, all of which shall be eradicated. I now bestow these upon you to transmit to the world below. Those who read and recite them in the human realm will gain boundless merit and dissolve all misfortune."

Then he proclaimed the invocations, saying:

To the North Pole’s mysterious vault, the Purple Tenuity’s imperial court,
To Mount Tai of the Eastern Peak, the limpid waters of the aquatic realm,
Who govern the Three Realms, command the myriad spirits,
Who examine the registers of the Three Primes, distinguishing good from evil,
Through fasting, rites, and recitation, no wish remains unfulfilled.
Dispelling disaster, absolving transgressions, bestowing blessings and prolonging life,
Merit without limit, vast compassion, vast vows,
Greatly sagely, greatly merciful, most exalted and wondrous Dao.
The First Prime, First Rank: the Heavenly Official who bestows blessings,
The Purple Tenuity Great Emperor.
The Second Prime, Second Rank: the Earthly Official who pardons sins,
The Pure Void Great Emperor.
The Third Prime, Third Rank: the Water Official who resolves calamities,
The Cavernous Yin Great Emperor.
The Three Primes’ sovereigns,
Three hundred and sixty responsive and perceptive Heavenly Worthies.

At that time, the Barefoot Great Immortal, together with the divine kings of the heavens and the assembly of perfected immortals, having heard the precious invocations, rejoiced greatly. They bowed in reverence and withdrew.
