**Transmission of the Three Teachings of Mysterious Unity by Master Renshou of Meishan**
**Chapter One: The Unmanifest in Primal Chaos**

At the very beginning, the One Chaos arose before form, enfolding the myriad existences in obscurity. Vague and dim, the Three Causes lay concealed in latency.
It seemed like *qi* yet was not *qi*; it resembled an image yet had no image. A shapeless mass, neither thing nor non-thing—such was its simplicity!
In its semblance of distant likeness, it embraced the four limits within and contained the Three Powers at its core. No sharp blade could force it open, no mighty cudgel could strike it asunder. The Three Realms of Great Clarity were as a mustard seed hidden within, unseen; the ten thousand transformations of the human Dao were as countless as the Ganges’ sands. The *qi*-types held their embryos, their forms like a hen’s egg. From within, it divided into the Two Modes—where then were Qian and Kun? From its midst, it enveloped the Five *Qi*—whence did Water arise?
Gold within sand, jade within stone—without a single chisel or washing, how could they be separated?
Thus, when simplicity scatters, the Great Ultimate unfolds; when form takes shape, the myriad images appear.
So vast was it, so hidden was it, so profound was it, so boundless was it—this was called the Dao, for it contained the True.
**Secret Formula:**
*No form, no image, no scent, no sound—*
*Before Heaven and Earth divided, how could I name it?*
*Obscure as uncut jade, merged in utter tranquility,*
*Such wondrous function marks the Dao’s course.*

---

**Chapter Two: The Scattering of Simplicity and the Division of Forms**

Before the undrilled mass of primordial haze congealed, movement and stillness, yin and yang were both obliterated. That which sought ascent could not ascend; that which was about to begin could not begin.
Drowsy yet containing slumber, slumber yet enfolding drowsiness—none could point to it. Vaporous and dense, like the gloom of layered mist; billowing and hazy, like the obscurity of fog veiling water.
This chaos was yin’s desire to scatter and yang’s urge to rise; this extremity was yang’s impending flourishing and yin’s impending division. Without the chaos of extremity, generation and transformation could not occur. Those who fathom the Dao contemplate it in silence.
**Secret Formula:**
*The Two Qi merge in chaos, the Three Powers undivided,*
*Enfolding the myriad existences, poised to unfold yet unformed.*
*Without extremity, no transformation; without movement, no tranquility.*
*Generation transforms, transformation generates—opening and closing, closing and opening.*

---

**Chapter Three: The One Qi Divides into Three**

When *qi* congealed and coalesced, it was turbid and undifferentiated. Its division lay within: that which was refined and nurtured ascended; that which was heavy and sunk descended. The balanced and unbiased gestated at the center. Thus, the center was the pivot of transformation, and transformation divided through the pivot.
Like casting water into raging flames, or cleaving an egg with a sharp blade—
When the One *Qi* scattered, the refined ascended, and the *qi* surged and churned, transforming with the clear.
The clear was yang, called Heaven. The heavy and turbid *qi* sank and coagulated, congealing with the turbid.
The turbid was yin, called Earth.
Above, it was Qian’s extreme of ten suns, where utmost yang was vigorous. Below, it was Kun’s extreme of twelve earthly branches, where utmost yin was transformative.
Once the Two *Qi* were sundered, what then was Man?
The clear was Heaven’s ancestor; the turbid was Earth’s source. The essence resided in the center, issuing forth in kind. When kind took form, it first bore the numinous—such was the inception of the human Dao.
To clarify the origin of the Two *Qi* and the beginning of the human Dao, one must seek it in the center.
**Secret Formula:**
*The One Qi first divides, the Two Modes come to be,*
*The human Dao lies within, enfolding the myriad spirits.*
*I am one with Heaven and Earth—why this division?*
*The Dao’s transformation lies here; return to it in clarity.*

---

**Chapter Four: The Qi Unfolds and Images Emerge**

From the One came the Three; from the Three came the Four; from the Four came the Five.
The One generating the Three: Heaven, Earth, and Man.
The Three completing the Four: east, west, south, and north.
The Five’s generation: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.
What does this mean?
Take Water as the One. Before the ultimate divided, its body was pure yin. Scattered, it transformed into *qi*; thus, *qi* gave rise to *qi*, and *qi* gave rise to Man.
That which *qi* transforms into *qi* is Water. It is born of Wood, transforms through Fire, and returns to Earth—this is the *qi* of future descent.
Thus, life is nurtured by Metal. Metal is the extreme of the Five *Qi*; having reached this point, it cannot revert. It transforms into rain, dew, frost, and snow—this is the meaning of Water to come.
When the Five *Qi* ultimately cease, reverse the sequence: take Metal as Water’s mother, Earth as Water’s father, and Fire as Water’s ancestor.
Why? The sun’s waves and the moon’s radiance exemplify this.
In the discourse on the Five *Qi*, why is Water the first and the kidneys? Because Man in the womb is like the undivided chaos. Yet why are Earth as One and Fire as Two?
When an infant is born, the Gate of Heaven opens, while the Gate of Earth remains sealed. At three years, speech begins—born of wisdom.
Yet it is not Water as One, Wood as Two, Metal as Three, and Fire as Four—why is this? Those who cultivate the True should observe this in reverse.
Thus, the *Yinfu*’s indications all reside herein.
**Secret Formula:**
*Once the One Qi scatters, Heaven, Earth, and Man endure.*
*The Five Phases and Four Limits—discourse on Water and Wood.*
*Abiding in the abdomen, breathing in chaos,*
*Grasp this meaning—it is the gateway to the Supreme Dao.*

**Chapter Five: The Myriad Images Contain Transformation**

Once the Two *Qi* transformed, the clear circulated and the turbid moved. Thus, *qi* had ascent and descent; kinds had birth and flourishing; things had prosperity and withering; affairs had succession and decline. The Five *Qi* each resided in the One.

**Chapter Six: From Void to Substance**

Dwelling in the East, it is called Green Yang; dwelling in the West, White Storehouse; dwelling in the South, Vermilion Brightness; dwelling in the North, Dark Splendor. Scattered, they gather; returning, they unite—thus the Central Ultimate is the pivot. Here, the Four *Qi*, Four Seasons, and Four Directions each embrace Earth within three months’ *qi*. Yet roots lie in Earth, birth in Wood, nourishment in Water, withering in Metal, and desiccation in Fire. Though destruction never ceases, what is cut down revives—because the Four Seasons each contain Earth. In spring, yellow blossoms appear, for Wood embraces Earth (present in the *chen* branch); in summer, yellow blooms flourish, for Fire embraces Earth (present in the *wu* branch); in autumn, yellow flowers emerge, for Metal embraces Earth (present in the *shen* branch); in winter, yellow shoots arise, for Water embraces Earth (present in the *hai* branch). The Five Phases, Five *Qi*, Five Images, and Five Directions—nothing is complete without embrace, nothing transforms without containment.

In the East, *yin* is Wood, yet it is the birthplace of Fire; in the West, Metal resides in *si*, yet it is the remnant of Fire. Within Water’s domain, Fire and Earth lie concealed; within Fire’s domain, the *qi* of Earth is enfolded. Generation and restraint, all embrace, all transform. Thus: one kernel, two sprouts, three husks, four leaves, five branches, six trunks, seven flowers, eight fruits, nine seeds, ten witherings—this is Heaven One, Earth Two; Heaven Three, Earth Four; Heaven Five, Earth Six; Heaven Seven, Earth Eight; Heaven Nine, Earth Ten. The Dao operates through the One *Qi*; one must guard the One. From One to Ten, all are contained within it, preserving the transformation of the unspoken. Thus, the Great One embraces true reality.

Those who cultivate the True should embody and practice this.

**Secret Formula:**
*From One, the Three arise—*
*myriad images contained within.*
*Heaven and Earth revolve at their center,*
*yin and yang in secret rotation.*
*A single speck of ancestral qi—*
*the Four Seasons move therein!*
*If you can grasp this,*
*you stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Creation.*

**Chapter Seven: The Transformation of Nature and Emotion**

The floating and the wandering have no ancestor; the void and the nonexistent have a source—all arise from the scattering of the One *Qi* and the alignment of the Five *Qi*. The void above is the transformation of clear *qi*, called the Vast Expanse; the substance below is born of turbid *qi*, called the Mountains and Rivers. Thus, what arises from the void harbors yang; what arises from substance harbors yin. Therefore, *zi* is void, *wu* is substance. The *qi* of *wu* is yin, yet Fire flourishes here—thus it is substance. The *qi* of *zi* is yang, yet Water flourishes here—thus it is void. Without void, substance is unknowable; without substance, void is unclear.

Yet Earth is substance—why does it not manifest in the twelve hours? *Qi* is void—why does it transform into the Three Pure Realms? Seeking substance through void is easy; seeking void through substance is difficult. In the void of Heaven, there is wind, rain, frost, mist, and haze—now gathering, now scattering—this is the origin of void and substance. In the substance of Earth, there are mountains, seas, forests, and crops—yet why do seas dry, rivers run dry, mountain peaks crumble, and earth quake? This is the resonance of void and substance.

What arises from nothing to become something is the substance of void; what arises from something to become nothing is the void of substance. Beginning with the mutual resonance of parents’ nature and emotion, a form with awe-inspiring presence takes shape—this is the substance of void. Yet when the Five Desires sprout and the One True scatters, seeking the original nature and emotion becomes impossible—this is the ease of seeking substance through void and the difficulty of seeking void through substance.

Thus, those who study the Dao take the prenatal as their foundation—this is precisely in accord with it.

**Secret Formula:**
*From void, qi is formed;*
*from qi, kinds arise.*
*Substance is born of kinds,*
*and weariness follows substance.*
*Seeking substance within void—*
*though difficult, it lies within.*
*Yet if substance is too substantial,*
*Water and Fire cannot destroy it.*

Once qi divides, images follow this illumination—thus, what dwells above the vault are called the sun, moon, and stars, wind, thunder, and lightning; what lies concealed below are called mountains and rivers, grasses and trees, birds and insects. Initially without nature, they respond to movement and thus possess emotion. When emotion stirs, nature follows! In grasses and trees, it manifests as flourishing; in deep pools, it manifests as qi—all born of yin yet generated by yang. Once nature exists, desire arises; once desire exists, emotion is born. Thus, when the solstice arrives, grasses and trees fulfill their nature: willows remain willows, flowers return as flowers. The stirring of insects—this transformation through movement—all begins with the solstice. The solstice is the winter solstice, which is *zi*, the inception of yang. In the hexagrams, this is *Fu* (Return), meaning "to revert." Thereafter, the nature and emotion of heaven, earth, and the myriad things flow through this. If all things are thus, how does human nature and emotion arise? From crown to sole, a person’s bones, hair, qi, and blood—every motion and stillness, opening and closing—mirror heaven, earth, and the myriad things. Thus, from void emotion, one resonates with true nature. Once enveloped in this emotion, one follows this nature, responding and transforming—possessing blood and pearls, clods and embryos—this is called conception, the first of Water. Therefore, it is yin that gives birth to yang, not yang that gives birth to yin. The function of the Dao lies in using emotion and nature as the great elixir—this is mastery of the Dao. Thus, the emotions of heaven and earth and the prenatal nature of parents become as clear as a mirror reflecting one’s visage.

**Secret Formula:**
*At first, the one qi divides into nature and emotion;*
*scattered, it turns obscure—gathered, it gives life.*
*The Three Powers share one origin—why set external measures?*
*Seek only resonance and union, and the body becomes luminously whole.*

Pure yang qi ascends to the left, pure yin qi descends to the right, while the central qi of gestation hangs in the center. The single transformation of *Qian* (Heaven) unfolds over ten days—this is the Great Yang. Yet it is said: "How can solitary yang accomplish creation?" Thus, nine days are spent in descent, one day in bathing. Once the nine descend, they form six—six being the inception of yin. Therefore, the moon’s light borrows the sun’s radiance. Beyond Mount Sumeru, in the vast heavens, the leftward and rightward revolutions of the celestial bodies leave the moon perpetually trailing the sun—this is due to its pure yin nature. *Qian* possesses the flourishing of the sun, *Kun* (Earth) the gestation of the moon—yin preserves yang, and yang yearns for yin. The sun rises and sets, ascending high: at first emerging from earth, it bursts forth from water, ascends into the void, and illuminates images—yet it can only brighten the day, not the night. The moon waxes and wanes, from new moon to full, from crescent to gibbous—its phases arise from borrowing yang, yet it is often deficient. Thus, its motion is slow or swift, lingering for thirty days without daily renewal—such is the Way of the sun and moon.

Why is it that their great brilliance, shining externally and illuminating things, cannot penetrate an overturned basin? Because there is no gap. A gap is the opening of transformation—through which the myriad images arise: these are the stars. Stars, too, are born of the sun, corresponding below to humanity. The sun merely revolves through yang, the moon merely circles through yin, but it is the stars that govern the turning of the four seasons, the succession of the Five Phases, and the alignment of the Seven Governors. Yet the stars’ correspondences are unstable and shifting, following the Way of change—thus, they are governed by the Dipper. Stars may wander, but the Dipper does not move carelessly; suspended day and night, luminous in the heavens, nothing rivals the sun—it, too, is but residual qi. Thus, the sun and moon have constancy, while the stars do not.

At the primordial division, heaven, earth, and humanity took form—signified by the sun, moon, and stars. When the three qi merge and return to oneness, this is the Dao of the prenatal.

**Secret Formula:**
*Qian holds the great crystal, the moon births great numen;*
*above and below gestate flourishing—within, stars take shape.*
*Heaven governs yang’s transformation, Earth governs yin’s balance;*
*the Three Powers share one qi—rooted in the origin of creation.*

At its inception lies emotion and attachment, and thus one falls into this realm. Beneath the vow of reverence, male and female take form. They come from the five qi, and within, they hold the dual forces of heaven and earth. Thus, before nurturing and before birth, dwelling in the mother’s womb, they drink blood and receive the placenta, hands covering their eyes, feet curled beneath the chin. With every breath the mother draws, the child draws as well; with every exhalation, the child exhales in turn. In all movements and tremors, inner and outer resonate—what awareness, what knowledge? What clarity, what understanding? The qi of heaven blends with it, the qi of earth blends with it, and the qi of humanity blends with it as well, yet a single breath remains. When the time of separation and birth arrives, heaven and earth seem overturned, the breaking of the placenta shocks the child—like one who, walking atop a great mountain, loses footing. Head suspended, feet braced, they emerge. With a great cry, that breath is forgotten.

Thus, they follow nature and follow desire, unable to hold both. The breath of the womb cannot be preserved a second time. Moreover, milk nourishes their cleverness, play delights their eyes, love tugs at their emotions, and desire commands their spirit. Gradually, a vast distance grows, the seeds of discord arise, and the breath of the womb is no longer guarded.

Those who study the Dao should savor this chapter to seek its essential truth.

**Secret Formula:**
*Beginning in primordial chaos, gestation takes form within;*
*the seven emotions and six desires settle into constancy.*
*Inhalation and exhalation—where true nature returns;*
*womb-breath, womb-breath—the Mysterious Female of the Dao.*

**Text Title:** *The Supreme Scripture on Cultivating the Dao and Realizing the Wondrous Origin of the Body*

One scroll, composed by Liu Yuanduan of the Southern Song.
Source edition: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Benwen* category.

**Preface to *The Supreme Scripture on Cultivating the Dao and Realizing the Wondrous Origin of the Body***

The Dao originates from the primal word, yet it has no name. Heaven itself does not speak, yet the ten thousand images revolve within it. From the void and origin, the wondrous One is contained; within the three darknesses, the division of the Two Modes later fuses. The three qi are the primordial origin, the primordial beginning, and the primordial ultimate. Without the ultimate, there is no transformation; without transformation, there are no images. Images are the root of all kinds, the source from which the ten thousand things arise. Through the transformation of the four limits, the four limits divide, giving rise to the four directions of heaven and earth, yin and yang, cold and heat, flourishing and withering, growth and decline—each following its kind.

Thus, the qi of the five phases transforms through one qi into water, which generates wood; wood generates fire; fire generates earth; earth generates metal. From this, the Dao of ceaseless generation and transformation arises. Once existence emerges, there must be nonexistence. From the interplay of existence and nonexistence, the cycles of birth, prosperity, decline, and death arise—sinking, rising, hidden, and manifest—each nourished in turn. When nourishment deepens, generative qi arises. Yet it is not merely qi; once qi is born, the Three Powers begin, and humanity dwells within them. At first, all arises from one qi; in the end, all scatters into the ten thousand transformations. Thus, emotions and nature, joy and anger, likes and dislikes branch like vines—giving rise to father and mother, husband and wife, male and female. From the ultimate beginning to the final transformation, kinds take form, arising from primordial unity and scattering into the ten thousand existences. Is this not the Dao?

**Chapter Ten: The Correspondences of Jia and Geng**

**Chapter Eleven: Nurturing the True through Breath**

Qian’s stem begins with *jia*; Kun’s union responds with *geng*. *Jia* arises from water’s birth, thus dwelling in the East; *geng* is water’s mother, thus nurtured in the West. Though the West is called stern, within *shen* lies water and earth. Thus, the West’s *geng* is destructive, yet life springs from the East’s *jia*, for *jia*’s qi resides in *yin*, also known as the third day of the threefold *jia*. The third day of *jia* divides afterward, preceding *geng*’s third day. *Geng*’s third day follows the beginning and end, for *jia*’s union is *ji*, and within *ji* lies earth—this is the harmony of the Three Yangs. *Geng*’s union is *yi*, within which lies wood; within wood lies fire, and fire can subdue *geng*, yet does not hinder water.

The marvel of the sagely Dao: *jia* resides in *zi* as the seal, and the seal is uprightness, uprightness is the beginning. Beneath *zi* lies water, and water can generate wood; thus *jia-zi* is the first, ending at *xu*, for *xu* is fire’s storehouse. *Jia* must be paired with *geng*, water’s mother, for within *shen* lies earth, which can generate metal. Yet at *chen* and *si*, it is cut off, for fire’s destructive force prevails.

Thus, those skilled in the Dao employ the prior qi of *jia-zi*, *jia-chen*, and *jia-wu* with the prior unions of *geng-zi*, *geng-chen*, and *geng-wu*, nurturing and resting in stillness. From *zi* to *chou*, from *chou* to *yin*, the mind remains unstained, the body like iron walls. Regulating qi and balancing breath, the stems of Heaven, the unions of Earth, and one’s own qi all resonate as one. The Dao of the Three Powers and Three Causes enters the eye and is naturally sufficient.

The formula states:
*Three jia and three geng,*
*First life, then destruction preserved.*
*At the appointed hour, on these days,*
*Heaven and Earth’s qi move as one.*
*No thought, no delusion,*
*Breath flowing ceaselessly, evenly.*
*The microcosmic orbit nears completion,*
*A luminous sphere arises within.*

**Chapter Twelve: Attaining the One and Achieving the Dao**

Heaven has apertures that generate wind; Earth has apertures that generate water. Heaven’s apertures are not easily discerned, while Earth’s may be observed. When an aperture opens, wind arises; when it closes, qi is obstructed. The apertures of Heaven and Earth are the profound mystery of the ten thousand images’ endless transformations.

Heaven and Earth can open through apertures and also rest through them. When at rest, Earth’s qi cannot ascend, and Heaven’s qi can descend. From *zi*, Heaven’s apertures open, its qi pure and descending; from *wu*, Earth’s apertures close, its qi turbid and ascending. All movement and stillness return to the bellows. The bellows is the alternation of opening and closing. Heaven’s bellows is *zi*; Earth’s key is *wu*; humans encompass them through breath.

Tracing day and night, one cycle governs 1,600 and more—this is the number of Qian and Kun. Those skilled in the Dao, who can preserve breath and understand apertures, truly nurture without labor.

The formula states:
*At the fourth watch, Heaven and Earth unite,*
*Unfolding the subtle to reveal its depth.*
*Water and fire are natural affairs,*
*No need to labor the mind.*
*Within the nose lie two apertures,*
*Heaven and Earth not a hair’s breadth apart.*
*If one can preserve this moment,*
*The bright moon is grasped in the palm.*

One is the primordial qi of the ten thousand images, the root and origin of Heaven and Earth, the great essential of the human heart. Qian unifies through one and completes its reckoning; Earth unifies through one and achieves its flourishing; humans unify through one and settle their nature. If one cannot align all with the One but scatters them amidst the ten thousand distractions, confounding the heart, the root and origin cannot be seen. Heaven’s One brings clarity; Earth’s One brings tranquility; the human One brings fragrant virtue; the body’s One brings uprightness; the household’s One brings order; inner One brings freedom from delusion; outer One brings compliance; the heart’s One harmonizes yin and yang; the thought’s One distances perversity; the nature’s One prevents emotions from arising; the qi’s One levels the breath; the breath’s One unites water and fire, bringing harmony to Heaven and Earth—how can one not seek the One?

The formula states:
*One is the qi of the Dao,*
*Qi is the source of the One.*
*If one can strive for clarity,*
*Seek only within the One.*
*Unawares, between dawn and dusk,*
*Suddenly gold appears in water.*
*Having attained the One, forget the One—*
*The spirit abides, truly inviolable.*

---

The Dao does not cling to words, nor can it be confined by them. Through qi, images take form; when qi is attained, images manifest in kind. Yet few realize that through qi, kinds arise, and from kinds, images emerge. Beneath the chapters, skillful phrasing abounds, but it is better to point to the essential and clarify the images of things, observing their transformations. Yet transformation follows the Dao, and chapters preserve words. Thus, the adept never debates, while those who debate are not adept—like fish in a well, who can fathom them? To know the joy of water, one must ask the fish. This is the meaning.

The formula states:
*First entering, the image is unclear,*
*Only upon seeing the image is the intent known.*
*Recognizing the image is the gateway—*
*Why cling to words?*
*Once clung to, the beginning is forgotten,*
*Like poling a boat without reaching the shore.*
*Unaware, the foolish and simple*
*Take this as the truth of the Dao.*

---

To nurture the spirit, one must first cultivate the heart; to refine qi, one should regulate the breath. The spirit arises from the heart, for the heart is the spirit’s dwelling; qi is the source of breath, and breath is governed by qi. Those who skillfully cultivate the heart must make it gleam like a clear pool reflecting the moon, still as an empty valley echoing no sound. Only then will the inner realm remain unmoved, external dust unintrusive; thoughts sink like iron in water, nature clings to nothing like the vast void. In profound tranquility, self and things both forgotten, the spirit clears itself, and qi gathers of its own accord. The spirit congeals through qi, and qi lingers for the spirit. At this moment, one is unaware of the breath’s ebb and flow.

The formula states:
*First following the breath,*
*Finally attaining qi.*
*Qi and breath guard themselves—*
*Self and things both abandoned.*
*Movement and stillness both forgotten,*
*The spirit’s abode is found.*
*It rests in cultivating the heart—*
*Not a single thread arises.*

---

The spirit’s function is not contrived. It begins with the heart’s cultivation and culminates in the preservation of qi to generate life, like clear waves reflecting a shadow or a bright mirror facing a form. Seeking it with a heart intent on possession will never yield it; seeking it with a heart devoid of intent only deepens its absence. How, then, can it be attained? The spirit values non-disturbance; the heart esteems non-thought. Guard it like stone, act like the foolish. The mouth utters no words, the ears hear nothing; thoughts do not arise, and nature does not drift. Like muddy water first strained, it naturally clears at the top while sediment settles below; the wind does not stir, and leaves still themselves. Unaware of Heaven and Earth, unaware of what "I" is—having entered the boundless, one dwells in primordial chaos, like the undivided Taiji, the unmanifest Three Powers. Suddenly, a single spark of spirit shines forth, like a vacant room filling with light. This arises from the heart’s absence, not from the heart’s effort. Thus, its comings and goings are without direction, its transformations follow its dwelling.

The formula states:
*The Dao is not named as Dao,*
*The heart forgets its own heart.*
*When all is unrecognized at once,*
*Only then is the valley’s echo heard.*
*Water and fire are not affairs,*
*Yin and yang arise within me.*
*Sitting amidst the boundless,*
*The spirit’s transformations all unfold.*

---

The Dao in relation to things, and things in relation to the Dao, begin with forgetting images. There are three thousand six hundred minor gates, giving rise to eighty-four thousand great delusions. Often, one hastens toward the strange and lingers in pursuit of the true. Among thousands or tens of thousands who advance in learning, not one or even half attain the Dao—because they cling to delusion and do not grasp the target. People all take the dragon and tiger as primary—this is wrong; they take golden elixirs and cinnabar medicines—this is wrong...

To take phoenix marrow and crow spirit—this is wrong; to take jade buds and golden blossoms—this is wrong; to take cinnabar lead and dark mercury—this is wrong; to take heart and kidney as water and fire—this is wrong; to take spleen-earth and liver-wood—this is wrong; to swallow saliva and absorb *qi*—this is wrong; to gather the morning sun and harvest the moon—this is wrong; to hum in the mountains, roar in the forests, rinse with springs, and sleep on stones, to daily swallow rosy clouds and nightly gaze at the Dipper—all these are wrong.

Scholars repeatedly fail to contemplate their origin and instead seek after its descendants. Before the Supreme Ultimate (*Taiji*) arose, before heaven and earth divided, before humans and things took form—could there have been such categories? In the essential practice, among hundreds of millions, none have truly preserved it. Is this not delusion upon delusion, confusion compounding confusion?

The formula states:
*Dragon and tiger are not the Dao,*
*Swallowing saliva is not merit.*
*Rosy clouds are not the sun’s harvest,*
*Spirit’s transformations do not return to wind.*
*Who has ever known the primordial *qi*?*
*Who can fathom the true source?*
*In an instant, the target is clear—*
*The Three Realms all are pervaded.*

---

**Primordial Water and Primordial Fire (Chapter Seventeen)**
The Supreme Ultimate enfolds the ten thousand images within *qi*; heaven and earth separate the clear and turbid through *qi*. It begins with darkness congealing and ends with *qi* transforming, scattering and drifting, each following its direction. Thus, those dwelling in the west are moved by metal’s kindred. The word *water* is the primordial *qi* of heaven and earth; the word *fire* is also the generative *qi* of *Qian* and *Kun*. Thus, from formless it becomes formed. In winter it lies hidden; in summer it unfolds. It enters into yang and emerges from yin; it conceals in yin and flourishes in yang. Human *qi* is the origin of *qi*.

Therefore, those who study the Dao transform *qi* with *qi*, preserve *qi* within *qi*. Through exhalation and inhalation, drawing and adding, it changes and takes form. To take water as water is not the Dao; to take fire as fire is also not the Dao. Only by preserving *qi* within *qi* do they become water and fire. Water and fire are the transformation from nonbeing into being. Only when there is no distinction of dawn or dusk, morning or evening, emergence or withdrawal is it correct.

Thus, those skilled in the Dao preserve the One with *qi* and nurture *qi* with *qi*. Then water naturally ascends within, and fire naturally descends from without. How could this be shown externally? One cannot but deeply reflect and understand.

The formula states:
*One *qi* unites yin and yang,*
*Metal and wood arise naturally.*
*Originally not water or fire,*
*The ten thousand images each preserve the true.*
*Qi* is the beginning,*
*In the midst, all transforms into spirit.*
*Standing at the shore, the oar is useless—*
*Only this is the cause of *Kan* and *Li*.*

---

**Preserving the One to Generate Spirit (Chapter Eighteen)**
When the heavens are clear, clouds and *qi* are pure; when the earth is still, grasses and trees are numinous. If one can embody and practice this, yin converges and yang unites. Thus, a single ripple can reflect the stars and constellations; a single numinous soul can know fortune and misfortune—this arises from its undispersed stillness, its unwavering preservation.

Yet later learners often fail to sweep the dust from the spirit-terrace and instead expand their verbal eloquence. Thus, through speech they forget *qi*, and losing *qi*, they lose essence. They take skill and clumsiness as freedom, and vast memorization as great ability. Thus, the pure and unified *qi* is lost, and the marvel of yin and yang vanishes with it.

Those who cultivate well gather it through stillness, refine it through simplicity, purify it in thought, and clarify it in the heart. They preserve it in silence and manifest it in plainness. Naturally, the celestial vault is clear, the earth’s axis is tranquil, *qi* embraces the One, and spirit becomes numinous. Then, without talismans, talismans work; without incantations, incantations take effect. Without spirits, spirits guard; evil flees, monsters hide, households are peaceful, and human affairs harmonize. With the ink of silence, one severs unrighteous spirits—this is the primordial, perfectly unified *qi*, the essential method of preserving the One and embracing the origin. Why bother distinguishing dragon and tiger, separating tortoise and snake?

The formula states:
*Thought after thought, focus on the cinnabar field,*
*Gather and preserve it firmly.*
*Without attachment to the five colors,*
*Within, heaven naturally appears.*
*No need to seek water or fire—*
*In the golden crucible, they are refined.*
*Morning and evening,*
*Spirit and *qi* refine the cinnabar field.*

**Spirit and *Qi* Form the Embryo (Chapter Nineteen)**
Within the heart, there is spirit; within *qi*, *qi* is preserved. If the heart is disturbed, spirit is not clear; if *qi* is depleted, *qi* must weaken. To project it from the crown is not as good as guarding spirit in its abode; to exhale *qi* and retain the true is not as good as nurturing *qi* and preserving *qi*. Spirit is the transformation of *qi*; without spirit, *qi* does not remain. Thus, spirit and *qi* are like mother and child, like heaven and earth—they cannot be separated even for an instant.

Those skilled in practice internally secure *qi*. This securing is not forced but arises naturally from the continuity of breath. As *qi* congeals, breath becomes even, and spirit naturally abides. At first, sitting is like a child falling asleep; over time, it is like a weary laborer shouldering a burden. From the legs to the navel, from the waist upward, one does not seek it. The heart is slightly tranquil, *qi* seems cut off. At this moment, what does the Dao-knower know of spirit? Understanding its transformation, who knows of the embryo? This embryo is not the embryo that births sons and daughters—it is the origin. The key lies in risking death at Hongya, forgetting the body like grass and trees, dying the heart like cold ashes. Unaware of self, unaware of body, after a brief moment when the wind’s sound and rain’s intent settle, breath is no more! *Qi* secures itself, spirit becomes numinous, and the embryo forms.

If this is so in the quiet of evening, what of daytime distractions? Simply savor the formula and verse—all will be understood.

The formula states:
*I use what does not use me,*
*The spirit-terrace is bare and pure.*
*Thought after thought, in the cinnabar field,*
*With the heart, let go.*
*Eyes and ears cut off seeing and hearing,*
*The mouth, though present, is as if mute.*
*A single point like the great void—*
*Let it be, whether “this” or “that.”*

**Chapter Twenty: Cultivating Virtue and Aiding All Beings**

Benevolence is the root of virtue; virtue is the foundation of the Dao. Those without benevolence cannot speak of the Dao; those without virtue cannot discuss transformation. Many practitioners prioritize longevity, seeking immortality, yet fail to understand what true longevity and immortality are. They strive to surpass others through contrivance, deceive themselves with artifice, delight in the affairs of mountains and forests without their purity, and seek celestial cranes without thoughts of benefit. Goodness has yet to take root while evil already manifests—like clutching prayer beads while stirring litigation, or holding rituals to strike others. Such people are unworthy of discussing the Dao.

Those capable in practice see another’s peril and rescue them, another’s distress and aid them, another’s fall and lift them. They feel another’s illness as their own, transform another’s wrongdoing, and upon seeing another’s beauty, do not entertain private desire. They revere another’s devotion to the truth as their own. Entering the Dao, they practice it; encountering karma, they abandon it. Then, they are frugal with themselves and generous with others, free from discord within or without, honoring parents with reverence. They cultivate simplicity for themselves and abundance for others. Such a person, in seeking truth, will be met with truth; in cultivating the Dao, will achieve the Dao. Moreover, they benefit descendants and transcend nine generations of ancestors—how sublime!

The formula states:
The Dao arises from virtue,
Only with virtue can one know the Dao.
Heaven and earth’s great virtue is life;
Sages and worthies are likewise made.
Longevity is the one true path,
Immortality is the Dao itself.
Dao, virtue, nature, and life—
These four are perfectly clear.

**Chapter Twenty-One: Honoring the Master and Revering the Ancestors**

Before the primordial chaos divided, one could not perceive the *qi* of heaven, earth, and the three powers. Without the Dao established, how could one understand the causes of parents and the myriad beings? Thus, where there is a root, there are branches; where there is a source, there are streams. Had the Most High not opened the Dao through transformation, had Laozi not set forth teachings, how could one recognize the rites of devotion?

With the Dao but no affinity, the Dao remains distant. With affinity but no master, the Dao is not clearly encountered. Collecting vast alchemical texts is inferior to seeking the formula; consulting many extraordinary people is inferior to preserving it within oneself. Thus, those who point are deluded; those who transform are upright; those who practice attain the Dao.

Therefore, ancestors must not be forgotten, and masters must not be neglected. When ancestors’ merits accumulate, descendants flourish; when masters are unclear, the root source is obscured. The Dao is specialized through virtue, revered through ancestors, and respected through masters—it must not be abandoned for even a day.

The formula states:
The *qi* of the One is the Dao’s ancestor,
A single word is the Dao’s master.
The ancestral *qi* must not be distanced,
The Dao’s words must be known day and night.
When descendants encounter this,
It is due to their parents’ hidden virtue.
Do not rely solely on oneself—
Know that it lies in the ancestors’ legacy.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: On Attainment and Non-Attainment**

One who has not traversed the vast sea does not know the peril of wind and waves; one who has ascended Mount Tai only then respects the danger of its peaks. At first, it seems easy to neglect; in the end, it is difficult to practice.

The Dao encompasses heaven and earth; humans embrace the three powers. Yet all day, they wander in confusion, unaware of its mysteries. Upon entering, they say: the heights of the clouds must be habitable, the depths of the abyss must be reachable. This is the limited skill of a performer, the water of a well-frog.

The greatness of the Dao cannot be measured; its subtlety, who can fathom? The trivial leaks of the five chapters are exhausted—there is no need to roam mountains and forests in search of wonders, nor to seek scriptures or visit extraordinary friends. Heaven and earth are a single vessel; the myriad beings of the Dao and virtue are all contained within this text.

Now that you have attained knowledge, act as if you have not, striving daily. If you have not yet attained, do not belittle later learners, do not disdain the scriptures, do not forget the ancestral root. The Dao transcends forced names—do not say that those who claim attainment have attained. Only when there is truly no attainment is there eternal attainment.

The formula states:
Yearn as if parched, seek day and night.
With true karmic affinity, encounter the Dao and virtue.
The heart ever feels inadequate—
This is the highest attainment.
Beware of fullness, lest it bring reversal and loss.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Saving the Living and Delivering the Dead**

The Dao transforms through virtue; virtue gives rise to sincerity, and sincerity transforms into reverence. When reverence issues forth as one, the hundred spirits guard it. Thus, to preserve it is to have spirits—this is called "guard"; to nurture it is to have qi—this is called "true." A single exhalation can become auspicious clouds; a single breath can become rain and dew. Circulating it can make one a Lord of Southern Florescence; refining and transmuting it can deliver those long submerged in dark obscurity. It is neither talisman nor incantation, neither spirit nor general, neither departure nor arrival. It is but one qi, one heart, one silence, one vigilance, one Dao, one virtue—one self. Applied to saving the living, illnesses are cured; applied to delivering the dead, the dead are transformed. So vast is this—what but the Dao could achieve it? So exalted is this—one must guard it earnestly! One must practice it earnestly!

The formula states:
Thought is the Dao; the Dao is the talisman.
Ghosts and demons flee in haste; the dark netherworld revives.
Silent offering lies within me; Heaven above naturally responds.
Saving the living and delivering the dead—
Like a fist unclenched, all unfolds with ease.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Scripture’s Perfect Completion**

The practice of merit, the cultivation of virtue, the application of the Dao, the essence of the scriptures—these can illuminate the Three Realms, penetrate the Five Phases, transcend the nine generations of ancestors, and transform the myriad beings. This is the scripture.

Among the lesser versions of this scripture in the world today, there are three:
The first, in the *jiashen* year, returned to the great waves, drowned and never recovered.
The second, from the *dingyou* year, was consumed by raging flames, reduced to ashes.
Later revelations, though descended again, diverged in wording and obscured in principle, like earth compared to jade.

Though it has descended once more, the long loss to flood and fire nearly erased it. Its return today is due to the profound reverence and great joy of devotion, and so it has been bestowed upon your household. You should uphold it, guard it, treasure it, and revere it. When merit, practice, virtue, and the Dao are perfectly complete, you may ascend.

Do not show it to those unworthy, lest they treat it with disdain. The retribution for transgression is severe, and the precepts are not trivial!

The formula states:
Ancestors possessed inherent virtue,
Thus the true Dao was received.
The true Dao, once spread,
From beginning to end, is your creation.
Merit lies in diligent cultivation;
Virtue lies in compassion and filial piety.
When virtue and the Dao are complete,
The entire household enjoys sublime fortune.

This scripture was bestowed by the Northern Pole Lord of Thunder Peak, the Golden Watchtower Incarnation of Primordial Essence, who pitied the multitude of beings lost in delusion, their true nature unawakened, their spiritual gate unopened. It descended through brush to the Daoist devotee Liu Yuanrui’s home, intending to spread its transmission and propagate its teachings. Yet Yuanrui failed to grasp the sagely intent, hiding the divine original among literary treasures, concealing it in a repository of offerings, and thus the profound mysteries of the teaching remained unilluminated.

After Liu Yuanrui’s passing, the copy preserved in his household was obtained and treasured by Zheng Guan, who had it carved onto blocks and printed for circulation. May those who study the Dao and cultivate truth thereby awaken to its wondrous principles and comprehend this cause.

Zheng Guan, however, fears that in future transcriptions, the celestial script’s calligraphy may be misconstrued by vulgar minds, with errors in characters, omissions, or unwarranted additions. It is fitting that those of penetrating insight correct and verify them.

Recorded by the long-devoted Daoist disciple Dong Zhengguan in the auspicious summer month of the *xinyou* year of the Jingding era.

*Here ends the* Supreme Scripture of Cultivating Truth and Embracing the Primordial Wondrous Dao.
