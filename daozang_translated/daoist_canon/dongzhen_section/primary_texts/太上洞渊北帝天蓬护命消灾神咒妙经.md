The *Supreme Cavernous Abyss Scripture of the Northern Emperor Tianpeng’s Divine Incantation for Life-Protection and Disaster-Dissolution*

At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was within the Fragrant Grove Garden, expounding the Dharma and reciting the precepts to the assembly of heavenly youths. When the discourse was complete, a youth named Vast Goodness arose from his rank, stepped forward, and bowed in reverence. He addressed the Celestial Worthy:

“Today, seated in attendance, we have heard the twenty-four articles of the luminous and true precepts—how the causes of good and evil bear their karmic retribution. The great assembly, filled with awe and joy, each uttered praises, realizing the supreme vehicle without further obstruction. Moreover, we have received your revelation of the karmic conditions of transgression, the methods of deliverance through purification rites, and the salvation of suffering souls from the long night of darkness, ascending to the halls of fortune where clothing and sustenance arise naturally. This Dharma is vast and universal; even the dead rely upon it.

Yet in this present world and future lives, men and women remain unacquainted with these scriptural admonitions. Some, weak in qi and strength, are unable to uphold them. Lacking protection against adversity, they are often assailed by the manifold malevolent spirits and perverse demons of the world, their lives cut short, their allotted years unfulfilled. Since the Celestial Worthy has already opened the transformation of great compassion, aiding both the living and the dead, the living and the departed alike bear the weight of your grace. We only beseech your mercy to further reveal a method for future men and women to defend their bodies and protect their lives, that they may be spared the three calamities and nine perils of this world, the five pestilences and seven afflictions, the poisons of illness and noxious qi, the host of demonic specters, and all manner of dire misfortunes. May their lives remain unharmed. Should you deign to show compassion, we would look up in reverence to your sacred grace.”

Then the Celestial Worthy rejoiced and replied: "Excellent, excellent. What you have requested is indeed of utmost importance. I pity all sentient beings as a mother cherishes her child. Now I shall expound it—listen carefully, hold fast, and never forget."

At that moment, the great assembly rejoiced and received the teaching with reverence.

The Celestial Worthy said: "In the distant past, people were simple and guileless, free from malice. They accepted their fate, whether long or short, and fulfilled their allotted years without premature death or unjust harm; no ghosts inflicted violence upon them. But in this later age, the world has grown shallow and hearts have turned corrupt. People sow mutual suspicion, each deceiving the other, rejecting the true Dharma and embracing only perverse conduct. They turn their backs on reality and chase after falsehood, straying from the Dao. They defy Heaven and rebel against Earth, severing their roots and felling their foundations. They are neither loyal nor filial, devoid of compassion. They deceive the multitudes, oppress the common folk, slaughter living beings, and destroy lives. Thus, they accumulate boundless karmic grievances. As a result, men and women of this generation constantly encounter misfortunes: some fall prey to bandits, others are harmed by malevolent ghosts; some perish without cause due to official or private slander; others are wounded by serpents, tigers, wolves, or venomous creatures. Some suffer unjust official calamities, imprisoned without reason, subjected to whips, cudgels, or execution. Others see their households ravaged by pestilence, their bodies afflicted by noxious qi, their families stricken with illness, their kin perishing, their loved ones scattered and lost. All such miseries arise because the qi of the Three Heavens has waned while the qi of the Six Heavens prevails. The realms of humans and ghosts are no longer distinct, and the boundaries between the perverse and the upright have blurred. Thus, the qi of imprisonment, the qi of sorrow, the qi of demonic possession, and the qi of licentiousness assail the living, spreading plagues and epidemics.

Now, the qi of imprisonment arises first, emerging from the north. From one it generates two, and sorrow follows in its wake. From two it generates three, and demonic forces wage their assault."

The kidneys wane and the heart is depleted; the lungs fail and the liver withers. Yellow clouds do not congeal, and black and white turn against each other. The demonic forces of the Six Heavens thus come to invade and harm. The eight legions of ghosts and spirits recklessly seek to annihilate. To attain deliverance, one must know the names of the Six Heavenly Gates and recite the Great Tianpeng Mantra. Rectify the mind, stabilize the thoughts, and contemplate with subtle wisdom. Only then will the great spirits appear, severing the old qi. Peace of body and tranquility of spirit arise therefrom. Prosperity of households and flourishing fortunes are thereby achieved.

Thereupon, the jade tones resonate, revealing the names of the Six Heavenly Palaces:

The first palace is named the Restful Brightness and All-Spirit Cavern Heavenly Palace.
The second palace is named the Primordial Controller of the Heavy and Upright Ancestral Spirit Heavenly Palace.
The third palace is named the Unifying Immortals Ascending Spirit and Rare Search Heavenly Palace.
The fourth palace is named the Upright and True Shao Spirit Search Controller Heavenly Palace.
The fifth palace is named the Cloud Terrace Jade Chronicle Bright Primordial Heavenly Palace.
The sixth palace is named the Revered Spirit Red Radiance Cloud Vale Heavenly Palace.

These heavenly palaces lie within the Ren and Gui mountains of the north, in the realm of Luofeng. The Northern Yin Spirit Lord governs over them. Flanking halls and chambers are administered by ghosts and spirits. Internally, they uphold the yin-yang principles of the Six Heavens; externally, they govern the dark boundaries of the Six Heavens’ Luo and Deng. Rewards for merit and punishments for transgressions are meted out without the slightest error.

With a single thought of upright truth, the six palaces open benevolently. With a single thought of perverse desire, the six palaces open malevolently. Though the qi of perversity flows unchecked, it is still summoned by the human heart. To sever the roots of evil, one must still the mind. Recite the names of the Six Heavenly Gates, bow to the north, and the divine spirits will revere and obey, daring not to inflict harm.

At that time, the Vastly Good Youth and the great assembly, having heard these words, were filled with both fear and joy. They stepped forward again, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "We have silently awakened to the conditions of the Dao through countless kalpas. We have known only to uphold the念 of the Dao, gathering our minds into one, and gazing down upon the human realm. We have ever grieved over the plagues and epidemics that cruelly harm living beings, leaving them bewildered and sunk in delusion, without escape. Though we have deeply pitied them, we did not know of such causes and conditions, nor of such virulent qi wreaking havoc in the world. Today, we have received your illumination—truths unheard for kalpas untold. Living beings and their kin may now know what to uphold and where to turn. Boundless are the benefits; we reverently bear the primordial grace. The names of the Six Heavenly Palaces are now inscribed upon golden tablets. The Great Tianpeng Mantra we listen to in stillness, ready to receive."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy’s jade countenance, moved by the subtle truth of the念, widely proclaimed, "Excellent indeed!" The causes and conditions of the Great Vastly Good Mantra are of the gravest prohibitions. I now entrust it to you truly out of compassion for those below, to deliver the multitudes. When my golden mouth expounds it, heaven and earth tremble in solemnity, divine spirits bow in reverence, the jade laws renew themselves, and humans and gods alike rejoice.

Then, turning to the left, he commanded the Left Primordial Perfected One in the Court of the Great Possession to open the purple-sun cloud-brocade casket and produce the Great Mantra, bestowing it upon the assembly of dharma practitioners. The Vastly Good Youth, having received the Great Mantra, was filled with exultation. Immediately, from his seat, he intoned the mantra in a resonant voice:

Tianpeng, Tianpeng,
Nine Primordials, Slaying Youth.
Five Ding Controllers,
Lofty Diao, Northern Lord.
Seven Governances, Eight Spirits,
Supreme Vastness, Mighty and Fierce.

The long-skulled giant beast wields the Emperor’s bell.
The Three White Owl Spirits harness the stern-drawn Kui-dragon chariot.
The Mighty Sword Spirit-King severs evil and erases traces.
Purple qi ascends to heaven; crimson clouds blaze and surge.
Devouring demons, consuming ghosts, his body spans the winds.
Azure tongue, green teeth, the Four-Eyed Old Man.
Heavenly Ding warriors, warding the south with awe to quell malice.
Heavenly Couriers, fierce and swift, bearing blades to the north.
Three hundred thousand troops guard my ninefold gates.
Split corpses for a thousand leagues, sweeping away all ill fortune.
Should any petty ghost dare approach to witness this,
the Heaven-Splitting Great Axe hews its fivefold form.
The Fiery Emperor’s scorching blood, the Northern Emperor’s burning bones.
The Four Luminaries shatter its remains; the Heavenly Strategist annihilates its kind.
One stroke of the divine blade, and ten thousand ghosts scatter in rout.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Northern Emperor’s Luminous Might decrees by oral command!

The recitation now complete, the great assembly pressed close, praising their karmic affinity and rejoicing in their encounter with this hidden name. In an instant, from the east came hosts of great deities, clouds and radiance scattering their hues as they tread the void through empty space. Some bore banners and regalia, some grasped halberds and spears; some trod upon the Eight Trigrams’ divine tortoise, some held the Three Heavens’ Fire Seal. Dragons and tigers flanked them as escorts; bells and drums resounded in unison. Streaming light blazed brilliantly as they made straight for the ritual arena. Emitting manifold dharma-sounds, their voices shook the vault of heaven. Circling before the Dao altar, they bowed twice and entreated earnestly: “We, benighted in the pure emptiness of the Dao, received life in the Thunderclap Realm of the East. Endowed with yang’s vigor, our forms coalesced from pure essence, and our name and title is Tianpeng. Above, we assist the Jade Emperor, administering the Brahma-realm; below, we descend to the abyssal springs, marshaling the hosts of the Primordial August One.”

The Six Heavens are governed solely by the principle of *sincere venom*. Yet how is it that today, crimson light fills the sky, illuminating the vast universe, its radiance bearing hidden scriptures that descend even to the domains under this humble minister’s command? We, struck with awe and dread, cannot fathom the cause. Thus, we have followed the light upward to seek enlightenment.

The Heavenly Venerable nodded and replied slowly: “Excellent, great general! From the union of yin and yang, qi coalesces; from the commingling of male and female, essence is conceived. There is the Dao of life, the Dao of death, the Dao of humans, the Dao of ghosts. Life gives rise to humanity; death gives rise to ghosts. Though the paths of life and death diverge, the nature of principle remains one. Yet through creation and action, karmic retribution varies.

I, together with the divine youths of the heavens, expound the essentials of the *Vajra Prohibitions*, discoursing on the causes and conditions of life and death. We see that throughout the world, the Six Heavens are steeped in poison, and perverse qi flows unchecked. The true Dao does not arise; wayward thoughts take root forever. Beings sink into the sea of suffering, adrift upon the river of craving. When one spirit falters, a hundred evils assail; the five spirits become inverted, the three palaces blocked. The Five Emperors no longer traverse their abodes, and the sacred dwelling is choked with dust. Flesh and muscle wither, while hun and shen are tormented and interrogated. Illness lingers, and the pain of poison is unbearable. This is truly lamentable, stirring the depths of compassion.

Only you, the gods, assist and guard the Northern Emperor. Your might subdues the multitudes; your power dispels evil. You stabilize heaven and earth, accruing great merit and virtue. Thus, I reveal the prohibitions of ten thousand kalpas and bestow the true tabooed name. I instruct the divine youths to transmit it throughout the world, that it may be recited forever. By your awe-inspiring virtue, descend to cast aside the unworthy. Subdue all demons, dispel inauspicious omens, sweep away all filth and poison, and ensure purity and solemnity.

Now that your retinue has arrived at the ritual arena, I further entrust you with this charge for the men and women of the world: bound by lust, imprisoned by killing, fettered by false thoughts, and self-harming through love and aversion. They do not realize that delusion arises from truth, and truth shifts through delusion. Once a single delusion is born, ten thousand evils flourish unchecked.

I now commission you to discern and rectify this: gather the perverse and return them to the true, using the true to suppress the perverse. Throughout the world, if there are good men and good women who suffer the calamities of the *Nine Nines and Sixes*, the *Three Declines, Eight Difficulties, Nine Obstructions, and Five Sufferings*—beset by malevolent qi, epidemics, and accumulated misfortunes—let them recite the great divine incantation. You shall follow the sound to respond to their pleas, rescuing them from peril, restoring them to health, preserving their allotted lifespan, and aiding the spread of the Dao.

At that moment, the Vastly Good Divine Youth, having heard the Heavenly Venerable’s weighty commission, rose from his seat, bowed twice, and addressed the assembly: “The Heavenly Peng General has personally received the compassionate countenance of the Heavenly Venerable. His divine thoughts are expounded, and his awe-inspiring virtue is fully prepared. Possessing such divine power, he can deliver all beings. We, having heard this together, are deeply fortunate.

When one invokes him, let them recite this hymn of praise:
*We bow our heads and take refuge in the Heavenly Peng General,*
*The mighty divine one who crushes hordes of demons.*
*His majestic chariot, drawn by dragons, descends to the ritual arena;*
*His blazing radiance shakes heaven and earth.*
*Lord of the twenty-eight lunar mansions and bright stars,*
*King of the thirty-six divisions of great gods.*
*Wielding a divine sword to slay demons and evil spirits,*
*Grasping the sacred seal to smite spectral fiends.*
*With his hoe-axe, he cleaves open the hells;*
*The imperial bell he shakes resounds through the celestial palace.*
*Lightning flashes and thunder rolls, winds and clouds surge;*
*His vast armored hosts brandish halberds and spears.*
*The Southern Dipper’s Fire Officials purge poison and harm;*
*The Northern Emperor’s Water Gods extinguish disasters and misfortunes.*
*Subduing the great demon kings of the Six Heavens,*
*Sweeping away the epidemic qi of the ten directions.*
*In his wrath, the sun and moon lose their brilliance;*
*At his breath, mountains and rivers boil.*
*Purple qi rides the heavens, circling below;*
*Three hundred thousand troops stand in silent readiness.*

When the recitation of the hymn was complete, celestial music and mysterious tones resonated spontaneously in the void, while flowers rained down and incense wafted through the air. The countless hosts, along with the Heavenly Peng General’s retinue of divine warriors, each bowed their heads to the Great Dao and joined their voices in praise. Benevolent clouds spread widely, bestowing grace afar. They vowed to transmit this teaching, transforming and delivering all beings. Having paid their respects, they took their leave.

Thus concludes the *Wondrous Scripture of the Heavenly Venerable of the Northern Depths, the Heavenly Peng, Protector of Life and Dispeller of Disasters*.
