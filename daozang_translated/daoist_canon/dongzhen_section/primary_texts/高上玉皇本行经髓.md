**Original Attribution:** Unrecorded.
According to the *Transmission of the Scriptural Lineage* at the end of the scroll, this was transmitted in the Yuan Dynasty, during the fourth year of Zhizheng (1344), when a Daoist from Guizhou’s Liuzhou encountered an old man on the Way who imparted it. The text is a condensation of the three-volume *Jade Emperor Scripture of Pure Precepts*, comprising one scroll. The base text is found in the *Zhengtong Daozang* under the *Original Texts* of the *Cavern-True* section.

**The Highest Supreme Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct**

**Daoic Teaching:**
In days of old, the Most Original Heavenly Venerable sat upon the Radiant Seat in the Seven-Treasured Mysterious Gardens of the Jade Emperor’s Palace in the Golden Gate of the Pure Brightness Heaven, expounding the *Soul Treasure of Pure Unity, Non-Dual Law* to the countless assemblies of the Unbridled. At that time, the Most High Jade Emperor and the assembled True Saints observed a solemn fast and ritual, standing in attendance.

When the time drew near, the Jade Emperor raised the Six Penetrations, emitting a boundless radiant light that illuminated all the heavens. Every realm trembled, and the ten directions became as a single crystal sphere—down to the lowest worlds, all beings of heaven and earth were suffused with Daoic *qi*. At that moment, the Iron Enclosure of the Underworld was shattered, and the sufferings of the Three Evil Realms were instantly liberated.

Then, the Jade Emperor divided his body, manifesting spontaneously across the ten directions in great heavenly palaces. Each became a White Jade Capital, a Golden Gate, and a Seven-Treasured Mysterious Garden Hall of Great Radiance, complete with a Radiant Seat, banners, flags, and canopies of rare flowers and jewels, all arrayed in splendor. The Jade Emperor, through these divided forms, expounded the *Way of Pure Liberation* universally across the ten directions.

After teaching, he employed his divine powers to remain motionless in place while transporting all heavenly and human beings to the assembly beneath the Most Original Venerable in the Pure Brightness Heaven’s Pure Celestial Realm. The gathered multitudes, unaware and unknowing, all came to the gathering.

At that time, the multitudes prostrated themselves, gazing in awe at the Jade Emperor’s transformed body. Suddenly beholding the Venerable’s sublime assembly, they leapt in joy, offering reverent homage, exclaiming at the marvel beyond compare.

Then, the High Void Pure Brightness Heavenly Sovereign and the celestial retinues arrived in their Eight-Scene Phoenix Chariots and Nine-Light Jewel Canopies, playing celestial hymns and wondrous music, chanting boundless sacred verses, scattering heavenly treasure flowers and spraying divine incense. They floated through the air, approaching the Dao before them, prostrating and kneeling to address the Heavenly Venerable:

*"Your lowly subjects were negligent in past assemblies. Today’s auspicious gathering establishes this Law Bridge, benefiting both the hidden and the manifest, the mundane and the sacred. Your radiant light shines upon all, manifesting rare and wondrous forms. We, your subjects, have accumulated merit over countless kalpas, and now the Nine Heavens’ fate has aligned. Today’s great fortune is all due to your sublime power."*

They praised the Heavenly Sovereign with this verse:

*The Golden Gate’s Lord of the Mysterious Vault,*
*The Highest Supreme Jade Emperor, Most Honored.*
*His wondrous form surpasses all the heavens,*
*His boundless compassion illuminates the Three Realms.*
*The True Saints, masters of the wondrous Dao,*
*Heaven and earth rely upon this Master.*
*He expounds the Great Vehicle’s Law,*
*Pointing the lost to the True Unity.*
*His virtues are as boundless as the void,*
*Praise of him knows no end.*

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable addressed the Four Assemblies:

*"This Emperor’s body is the Dao’s body—an extraordinary form. If you draw near to him with reverence, focus your thoughts on his countenance, and extol his name, then you shall all be protected."*

Then, the Five Elders—the Heavenly Ancestors of Heaven and Earth—prostrated and knelt, reporting to the Heavenly Venerable:

*"We have heard that the Highest Supreme Jade Emperor, in his boundless compassion for the common folk, universally emits his divine light, illuminating the Dharma-realm. The Six Ordinary and Four Sacred beings all partake in his Daoic shelter. Since ancient times, before Heaven and Earth were divided and the sun and moon shone, it was the Jade Emperor who gave rise to the separation of the Two Principles and the emanation of the Three Lights. His imperial title is beyond speech, impossible to fathom in detail. We have thus commanded the casting of golden tablets and the carving of jade seals, truly embodying the wondrous virtue of the sacred scriptures—the primordial root of Heaven and Earth. We humbly pray for mercy, that we may follow the sacred rites and transmit this Law according to its precepts."*

Then, the Heavenly Venerable proclaimed to the True Saints:

*"Now the Three Heavens’ [missing character] fate has turned, and the Daoic *qi* of the Sovereign Way flows freely. The True Way must now be practiced."*

He commanded the Five Elders and the True Saints to ascend to the Cold Soul Hall of the Supreme Mysterious Jade Capital in the Upper Palace of the Purple Micro, where they opened the Nine-Light, Eight-Colored treasure chest and the Cloud-Brocade pouch. From within, they extracted the *Soul Treasure Golden Scriptures and Jade Seals*, inscribed:

*The Most High Supreme Miro Heaven,*
*The Mysterious True Realm of Wondrous Existence,*
*The distant Purple Golden Gate,*
*The Jade-Clear Palace of the Great Micro,*
*The Boundless Supreme Saint,*
*Embodying the Radiant Law.*
*The silent, boundless宗 without dogma,*
*The Mysterious Pattern encompassing the ten directions.*
*The serene, eternal Dao,*
*The vast, boundless divine power.*
*The Great Jade Emperor of Heaven,*
*The High Sovereign of the Mysterious Vault.*

At that time, the Five Elders received this scripture and returned before the Most Original Heavenly Venerable, seeking clarification on the prohibitions and rites. They humbly declined, saying:

*"This imperial title is the Most Original’s wondrous speech, the Jade Emperor’s true edict—a most sacred and wondrous text, naturally responsive to the divine."*

Thus it is known that the Heavenly True One is of supreme worth, the most sacred scripture—this hidden text, which none may glimpse or hear. Those who obtain it must diligently practice and venerate it to attain divinity.

Then, the Jade Void Heavenly Sovereign addressed the Heavenly Venerable:

*"I wish to uphold this scripture for the Four Assemblies and all future beings who receive it, proclaiming its benefits."*

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable told the Jade Void Heavenly Sovereign:

*"If in any of the boundless lands of the Three Realms and Ten Directions there arise wars, plagues, floods, droughts, locusts, or years of famine and scarcity, the ruler of that land must act with compassion. For the sake of his people, he should universally invite Daoists of purity and austerity to recite this scripture. Then his land shall know peace, the five grains shall flourish, and the people shall prosper."*

In every place where this scripture resides, the **Ten Directions’ Most Authentic Guardians** will always supply and venerate it, and those who uphold this scripture shall reap boundless blessings.

Moreover, if one who upholds this scripture makes a long banner and inscribes the **Heavenly Sovereign’s Name** upon it, and the winds blow it toward any direction, all beings in that direction shall partake in its supreme benefits.

Again, if one who upholds this scripture inscribes the **Heavenly Sovereign’s Name** upon all things that make sound—whether in **Dao/Way halls**, or through games and contests, or when touched by the wind—when that sound emerges, all beings who hear it shall instantly be cleansed of all sins and afflictions. How much more so for those who receive and uphold it!

Know that such a person is the very **Dao/Way Repository** and **Virtue/Power Body**.

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable spoke to the Jade Void Heavenly Sovereign:

*"Now I have briefly spoken, yet its mysteries remain unfathomed. If I were to expound it fully, the common folk would be misled by heretical views, filled with doubt and disbelief. The merits of this scripture are beyond measure, even across countless eons."*

When the Jade Void Heavenly Sovereign heard these words, his heart overflowed with joy. Gazing upon the **Compassionate Countenance**, he bowed in reverence and praised in wonder, then composed a hymn:

**Nine Heavens above**, called **Great Luo**.
**Jade Capital’s golden gates**, with clouds piled high and grand.
Within it stands the **Heavenly Sovereign**, kind and benevolent, harmonious and gentle.
The **Supreme Dao/Way** is unmatched, subduing all demons.
**Heaven’s Treasures**—spiritual talismans—**Jade Laws** and **Golden Precepts**.
Countless **gods and immortals**, their banners and flags abound.
Hearers’ sins are annihilated, forever freed from the **River of Love**.

At that time, when the Jade Void Heavenly Sovereign spoke this hymn, all the **Heavenly Hosts** in unison exclaimed in awe: *"Never before have we heard such!"*

Then, the Heavenly Venerable proclaimed to the **Four Assemblies**:

*"All mortals who recite and extol this scripture, invoking the **Heavenly Sovereign’s Name**, are those with profound **Dao/Way roots** and past virtuous connections. This scripture’s glory is exalted and boundless—it universally liberates. If they devoutly uphold it with sincere reverence, their **families and nations** shall know peace, their lives preserved from calamity, and all inauspicious omens swept away. It can shatter an **iron encirclement** around a mountain, drain the **Sea of Bitterness**, break the **Great Earthly Prison**, and rescue beings from dire suffering and heavy crimes. It can subdue **violent malevolent demons**, protect all lands, and eliminate every grave illness. It can dispel all evil poisons, distance one from all wicked men, extinguish all ferocious beasts, and crush all heretical **Dao/Way paths**. All the **Heavenly Hosts** shall command them to submit in reverence. Its remaining merits are too vast to fully recount."*

When the **Four Assemblies** heard this, they rejoiced with leaping spirits, bowed in respect, and withdrew.

**The Original Dao/Way Practice of the Highest Jade Emperor**
**Transmission of the Scriptural Lineage**

The **Twenty-fourth direct descendant** of the **Supreme True Sovereign of the South Peak**, the **Commanding Worthy of the Purple Void**, **Master of the Pure and True Five Thunder Dao/Way**, **Liu Chǔyuán** of the **Ancheng Jade Source Immortal Sect**, in the **fourth month of the fourth year of the Yuan Dynasty’s Zhèngzhèng era (1344)**, wandered from **Guangxi’s Liuzhou** to the **northern seas**. On the **fifteenth day of the eighth month**, he arrived at a **post station in Shíchéng County, Huàzhōu Prefecture**, where there was **no trace of human habitation**. By **midnight**, the wind was still and the moon bright—**restless in his travels**, he **gazed at the moon**.

Unbeknownst to him, he wandered until he reached the roadside, where he saw an old man seated upon a stone—broad-browed, silver-haired, cross-legged in meditation. Master Liu approached and, bowing, inquired: *"How far remains to Huàzhōu?"*

The old man replied: *"Half a day’s journey. Now bandits ravage the prefectures, slaughtering and plundering officials and commoners. The living perish in droves—truly pitiful. You must proceed with utmost caution."*

Master Liu thanked him, saying: *"Your guidance is most gracious. Yet life and death are fated; none can alter destiny."* Then he asked: *"What year were you born?"*

Master Liu disclosed his birth date, and the old man studied his palm, declaring: *"Your fate holds trials of malaria, banditry, blades, and drowning. Yet you shall have the merit of saving lives—though not escape this one trial."*

Master Liu pleaded: *"Then teach me a prayer to avert it!"*

The old man said: *"Recite the *Original Dao/Way Practice of the Highest Jade Emperor* with sincerity. Though trials come, they shall not harm your true life."*

Master Liu sighed: *"I have practiced the Dao for thirty years but never encountered this scripture. I have only the *Original Dao/Way*, which I recite daily. How shall I find this sacred text to ward off disaster?"*

The old man smiled: *"Fortune favors me—I carry this very scripture. I have memorized its verses and shall now transmit them to you."* From his robes, he withdrew a yellow silk pouch, extracting the text and pressing it into Master Liu’s hands. *"Recite it with devotion, spread it widely among the world. Those who read it shall reap boundless blessings. I am a Daoist of Pílíng. Remember my name."*

With these words, the old man rose and walked three steps before ascending into the clouds, vanishing. Master Liu knelt in reverence, his vision blurred—only the stone bore the imprint of his seat and the faint traces of his ascension.

By the sixteenth day’s noon, Master Liu arrived in Huàzhōu, lodging beneath Lóngmǔ Mountain at the home of Chén Zōngwǔ in Shílóng County’s Pānlóng Ward. He inquired after the magistrate of Liánzhōu, **Huáng Yīlóng** (courtesy name Yúncóng), a native of Wúchuān, who then served as acting magistrate of Shílóng. When Master Liu asked of the name of the old post station where he had rested, Yúncóng replied: *"It is called Xiānjiè Pù—the 'Inn of the Celestial Realm.'"*

Master Liu asked: *"Why is it so named?"*

Yúncóng answered: *"Long ago, a Daoist sat beside the inn, leaving behind stone imprints of his seat and footsteps as proof to mortals. This sage sometimes conceals himself, sometimes descends—rarely seen by men."* Master Liu reflected: *"Could this not be the divine manifestation, transmitting the scripture anew?"*

On the twenty-fifth day, he fell ill with fever and chills, his condition grave. Bandits raided the region night and day, their cries unceasing. Master Liu’s anxieties mounted.

On the first day of the ninth month, at the hour of **Zǐ (23:00–01:00)**, his fever raged, and in delirium, he saw a golden-armored celestial deity shout: *"Bandits approach! Flee at once!"* His mind cleared, his fever abating.

He swore to the heavens and recited the scripture, then propped himself against his pillow. Dawn broke as a sudden storm erupted. Startled, he called to his host, **Jiāng Dérùn**: *"Bandits come!"*

Master Liu, clutching his scripture, rushed outside. Men and women fled in panic through the streets. He joined them, reaching the riverbank where refugees scrambled onto boats. A passenger, the Huàzhōu magistrate **Zhāng Sīlì**, shouted: *"Master, the bandits are close! Hurry into the water!"*

Master Liu turned—bandits stood but twenty paces away, spears and crossbows raised. He leapt into the river, yet his body floated effortlessly a mile downstream before a boatman, **Wú Rìmíng**, pulled him aboard. His clothes were drenched, but his scripture remained dry.

Master Liu knelt, offering thanks to Heaven, Earth, and Water: *"How deep your mercy! I cannot swim—yet the *Original Dao/Way Practice* must have shielded me, its divine power unseen. Though fate spared me from bandits and blades, who else could have saved me from drowning?"*

He vowed: *"I dare not let this treasure perish. I shall engrave, print, and disseminate it far and wide, that all who have affinity may attain Dao/Way qi and together verify its mystic efficacy."*
