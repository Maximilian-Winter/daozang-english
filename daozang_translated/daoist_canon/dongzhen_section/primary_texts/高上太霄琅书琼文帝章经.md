**The Cloud Son, Yúnwùzǐ**, was indeed a descendant of the Primordial Sovereign, *Yùxū*, the middle son of the *Tàidì*. He bore the jade embryo in the jade chamber, refined the cloud essence at the golden gate, contained the sun and moon within the purple cell, transformed the great dew to condense the spirit, tempered the embryonic breath to circulate the vital force, endured countless kalpas upon the wheel of existence, and was born of the Primordial Clan, proclaiming the Yang Dao to attain the True.

Thus, in the first year of the *Shànghuáng*, on the first day of the third month, as the celestial radiance brightened the dawn, he was born in the Nine Obscure Realms above the Heaven of Boundless Splendor. He beheld the sun upon the cloud cliffs, his golden visage gleaming in the jade pavilion, aligning with the imperial lineage in the celestial diagram, his natural virtue surpassing jade. Bathed in the nine numinous luminaries, nourished by the fragrant jade springs, drinking the numinous consort’s royal reishi, fed with the nine-refined flying frost, a divine dragon winged his side, a jade phoenix sheltered his brow. Purple mists arose above, luminous radiance spread abroad, the two symbols upheld his essence, the three dawns harmonized his truth. The divine land sang of his marvels, his spirit transformed through seven revolutions, the numinous wind quickened his form, the drifting fragrance dispersed the dust. Lofty in the Great Void, boundless at the edge of the cavernous waves—

At twenty-nine years of age, he pondered the subtle and the profound, followed nature’s course, yielded to the Dao’s unfolding, unattached to the imperial Way, wandering the Central Plain, roaming the Celestial Azure, lingering in the Purple Heaven, gazing across kalpas, lost in delight, his movements beyond his own control—thus he soared as a transcendent sage.

He was then named the *Shūdì* of the Imperial Edict, ascending to the *Tàizhēn* rank. The Three Primordials bestowed teachings, granting him the title of *Huángpiān*. At that time, receiving the mandate, he paid homage to the Jade Heaven, ascending the Nine Obscure Platform of the Great Possession Palace, the Purple Phoenix Jade Capital’s Seven-Treasured Pearl Chamber. In the Hall of Bright Mists, the Pure Feast Pavilion, the Numinous Auspices responded—his neck bore a circular radiance, the divine candle illuminated the night, the jade hall shone of its own accord.

Then, the *Xūhuáng Dàojūn*, in the void above the cavernous emptiness, within the profound abyss, bestowed the *Tàixiāo Lángshū Qióngwén Dìzhāng* upon him.

At that time, the celestial light descended into obscurity, the three dawns returned their essence, the five stars altered their courses, the seven primal cycles moved with numinous power, the nine hues dazzled in splendor, illuminating the Jade Purity. Flying mists swirled thickly, drifting across the eight cavernous depths. The jade steps were ascended, ten thousand sovereigns gathered in court. Flying immortals with feathered canopies assisted the *Tàizhēn*, three thousand celestial boys and girls, each bearing towels and scattering incense, their fragrance sweeping the dust.

Then the command was given: the five numinous beings were summoned, the celestial chariot wheeled through the clouds, riding the void’s threads of mist. The divine phoenix reared its bridle, the numinous consort led the way, the Bright Sovereign opened the path, the three Dao’s merged in clarity, lightning flashed with vital essence, the swift chariot soared through the Nine Obscure, gazing upon the jade gates. Feasting in the Three Primordial’s realm, circling the jade heavens, indulging in the purple dawn—

Thus he unveiled the *Lángshū* upon the boundless cliffs, recited the Imperial Chapter among the blue clouds, cultivated the latent roots with the jade precepts, summoned the numinous powers with the jade writings, sang the wondrous melodies in the void, focused the still thoughts in the jade pavilion, harmonized the two principles in the profound diagram, held the imperial records among the ten thousand immortals, oversaw the earthly officials of the five peaks, led the Highest Truths through the three passes. Above, he governed the boundless; below, he encompassed the cavernous sources. From heaven downward, all were subject to the *Tàizhēn*. His spirit was unfathomable, his transformations nameless, his proximity indescribable, his distance unsearchable, his clarity beyond sediment, his unity beyond purification. How subtle and wondrous! This was the supreme virtue of the imperial numinous, the awe-inspiring exalted one.

The *Celestial Azure Cloud Jade Writing* is the flying melody of the Nine-Heaven Sovereigns, the *Jade Writing Imperial Chapter* is the scripture of the Nine-Heavens above.

Both originated at the Primordial Beginning, born within the natural void. The *Xūhuáng Yùdì* received them from the Nine Obscure.

Thus, the heavenly sovereigns recorded their names, casting gold into tablets, carving jade into chapters, engraving gold and jade with numinous script to manifest the precious texts. They were secreted in the Nine-Heavens above, in the Great Possession Palace. The Western Hua Jade Maidens and Golden Dawn Jade Boys, three thousand each, attended as guardians, tending the incense.

Thus, the nine sovereign emperors, in their monthly ascents to the jade steps, feasted with the divine truths, their cycles encompassing ten thousand kalpas, transmitted to the *Tàizhēn Wáng*. Their Dao was exalted and wondrous, surpassing all scriptures, their spirit towering and refined, their essence crowning the Nine-Heavens. Their jade wisdom was clear and luminous, their profound penetration entering the void. Only the highest transcendent adepts could partake—all were already perfected immortals, and the text was not transmitted to mid-level immortals.

The *Celestial Azure Cloud Jade Writing* is the flying melody of the Nine-Heaven Sovereigns, the *Jade Writing Imperial Chapter* is the high numinous, profound and reflected Dao, the essence of the Nine-Heavens, overseeing the ten thousand *qi*, encompassing all scriptures.

Those who practice the *Dàdòng Sānshíjiǔzhāng* must blend the imperial unity’s wind, interpreting the latent roots, ascending the seven obscurities—without this text, the Nine-Heaven Sovereigns will not accept their sounds. The nine *qi* will intertwine in disorder, the divine truths will not rejoice, celestial demons will intrude upon the scene, ten thousand trials will assail them. Their thoughts will not penetrate the subtle, heaven will not open the pass.

All who practice the myriad scriptures must take the *Jade Writing* as their first priority. Reciting and chanting in secluded chambers, they rejoice in tranquil courts of mist, traversing the Nine-Heavens with ease, refining the loftiest mysteries, so that the Jade Palace is startled by their resonance, ten thousand immortals gather at the hall, demonic hosts bow in submission, and all trials dare not approach. Whatever Dao they seek to cultivate, they shall attain its true essence, and the Way will be fully realized, ascending to the Supreme Clarity.

The essential key lies solely in this scripture—no need for further complexity. With focused devotion and arduous practice, one may attain the Upper Immortal.

Yunwuzi did not pursue other teachings but received the *Celestial Azure Cloud Jade Writing* and *Jade Writing Imperial Chapter* from the Emperor of the Void. Above the Nine-Heavens, he sang the wondrous verses, reveling in boundless delight, harmonizing with the divine *qi* and virtues, and thus received the edicts of the Three Epochs, ascending to the rank of *Tai Zhen Wang* (Supreme True King).

He transmitted the Dao to:
- Taihua Zhenren (True Person of Taihua),
- Santian Changsheng Jun (Long-Life Lord of the Three Heavens),
- Taihe Zhenren (True Person of Great Harmony),
- Donghua Laozi (Old Master of the Eastern Flower),
- Nanji Zongsi Jin Jun (Supreme Commander of the Southern Pole),
- Xitai Zhonghou (Central Marquis of the Western Platform),
- Beidi Zhongzhen (Central True One of the Northern Emperor),
- Jiuling Yuzzi (Jade Child of the Nine Spirits),
- Taoling Zhenfei (True Consort of Supreme Clarity),
- Chijing Yutong (Jade Boy of the Vermilion Precision),
- Xuangǔ Xiānsheng (Master of the Mysterious Valley),
- Nan Yue Chisong (Red Pine of Southern Mountain),
- Zhongshan Wang Qiao (King Qiao of Zhongshan),
- Ziyang Zhenren (True Person of Purple Yang),
- Xicheng Wangjun (King of the Western City),
- Zhonghuang Xiānsheng (Master of the Central Sovereign),
- Zhao Bo Xuan (Azure Mystic Zhao),
- Shan Zhongzong (Master Zhong of the Mountain).

These eighteen individuals all cultivated this Way, their faces radiating golden radiance, their necks bearing circular halos. They rode the winds to the heavens, feasting in the Purple Courts, transforming in myriad forms, soaring freely as they willed. With a whistle, they summoned ten thousand spirits, subduing demonic hosts and deciding life and death. They rode the clouds and mist, entering and exiting the Imperial Courts—all through the *Jade Writing*, attaining the Supreme True.

King Wang ordered a copy sealed in the mountains of Xicheng, inscribed with the Golden Imperial Edict and green characters on purple grounds. Those who attain unity shall obtain this text.

Treasure it as a secret—do not transmit it lightly. If the sacred verses are leaked, the Nine Ancestors of the Dao will interrogate them, condemning them to eternal punishment by the Ghostly Officials, forever sealed in the Underworld, with no hope of redemption across ten thousand kalpas.

**Ninth, the Heavenly King of Bōlǐdáhuō** (波梨答和天王 *Bōlǐdáhuō Tiānwáng*), surnamed **Wang** (姓王 *xìng Wáng*), with the true name **☯☯** (讳☯☯ *huì ☯☯*), wears a **fur-lined robe of nine colors, seamless and patterned with mysterious clouds and celestial treasures** (九色无缝玄云宝裘 *Jiǔsè Wúfèng Xuányún Bǎo qiú), and crowns his head with the **Primordial Flowing Yellow Star of Celestial Stability** (无极流黄镇星飞精 *Wújí Liúhuáng Zhènxīng Fēijīng). He rules over the **Heavenly Capital of Layered Mounds and the Great Marvelous Palace of Nine Curved Chambers** (陵层玉京大有妙宫九曲之房 *Língcéng Yùjīng Dàyǒu Miàogōng Jiǔqū zhī fáng*), where **ninety thousand True Celestial Maidens** (真玉女九万人 *Zhēnyùnǚ Jiǔwànrén*) attend him on either side.

The **Nine Heavens and Nine Heavenly Kings** (九天九王 *Jiǔtiān Jiǔwáng*) are the **root essence of ten thousand qi** (万气之本宗 *Wàngqì zhī běnzōng*), the **ancestors of all True Emperors** (众帝之祖先 *Zhòngdì zhī zǔxiān*), and the **source of the Nine Qi Essences** (九气之精源 *Jiǔqì zhī jīngyuán*).

Before Heaven and Earth congealed, and the **Three Celestial Lights** (三晨 *Sānchén*) were not yet manifest, they formed naturally within the **Void of the Nine Heavens** (空洞 *Kōngdòng*), amidst the **profound and boundless** (溟涬 *Míngdàng*). Over **ninety thousand kalpas** (九万劫 *Jiǔwànjié*), they divided and refined the qi, establishing the **Nine Heavens**, where the sun, moon, stars, and constellations came to shine, and **ten thousand qi** (万气 *Wàngqì*) flowed and transformed, forming the **Dao/Way of True Reality** (道真 *Dàozhēn*).

The **Primordial Sovereign** (元始上皇 *Yuánshǐ Shànghuáng*) and the **Highest Celestial Jade Emptiness** (高上玉虚 *Gāoshàng Yùxū*) were born within the **Heaven of Beginnings** (始天 *Shǐtiān*), alongside the **Thirty-Nine Emperors** (三十九帝 *Sānshíjiǔ Dì*) and the **Twenty-Four True Ones** (二十四真 *Èrshísì Zhēn*), thus forming the **palaces and officials of proper order** (宫阙次序之官 *Gōngquè Cìxù zhī guān*). Their **Sacred Scriptures** (宝经 *Bǎojīng*) are all composed of **naturally formed chapters** (自然之章 *Zìrán zhī zhāng*) to be practiced.

The **methods of longevity** (长生之道 *Chángshēng zhī Dào*) and **ways of non-death** (不死之方 *Bùsǐ zhī Fāng*), along with **sacred talismans and jade precepts** (符章玉诀 *Fúzhāng Yùjué*), all originate from the **Nine Heavenly Kings** (九天之王 *Jiǔtiān zhī wáng*), passed down to the **True Ones of the world** (世代之真 *Shìdài zhī zhēn*).

When the **Great Change of the Three Five** (三五改运 *Sānwǔ Gǎiyùn*) occurs and the **Nine Celestial Spirits** (九灵 *Jiǔlíng*) respond to the appointed time, the **Nine Mysterious Dao/Way Lords of the Later Saints** (后圣九玄道君 *Hòushèng Jiǔxuán Dàojūn*) will scrutinize the **Primordial Essence** (本元 *Běnyuán*), having experienced **nine hundred thousand billion nine thousand kalpas** (九万亿九千累劫 *Jiǔwànyì Jiǔqiān Lěijié*). The **Sacred Scriptures** (宝经 *Bǎojīng*) of the **Primordial Sovereigns** (上皇 *Shànghuáng*) are mostly unaligned with this.

The **Dao/Way Lord** (道君 *Dàojūn*) declared in the **First Year of the Middle Sovereign** (中皇元年 *Zhōnghuáng Yīnián*), on the **first day of the ninth month** (九月一日 *Jiǔyuè Yīrì*), within the **Golden Gate of the Heavenly Pearl Hall** (玉天琼房金阙 *Yùtiān Qióngfáng Jīnè*), the **Eastern Flower Palace and Azure Court** (东华青宫 *Dōnghuá Qīnggōng*) were to be sought after in their **proper order** (寻俯仰之格 *Xún Fǔyǎng zhī gé*). The **Ancient Texts** (古文 *Gǔwén*) were recorded and the **Sacred Scriptures** (灵篇 *Língpiān*) were revised and compiled into **three hundred volumes** (三百卷 *Sānbǎi juàn*), entrusted to the **Upper Minister, the Celestial Azure Boy** (上相青童君 *Shàngxiàng Qīngtóng Jūn*), to transmit to **later students, those whose names and essences are true** (后学玉名合真之人 *Hòuxué Yùmíng Hézhēn zhī rén*).

All who study and seek immortality, yet do not know the **origin of the Dao/Way** (道之所出 *Dào zhī suǒchū*) and the **source of the Sacred Precepts** (宝诀所生 *Bǎojié suǒshēng*), study in darkness and lack ancestral lineage. The **True Ones** (真 *Zhēn*) will not descend, and the **Dao/Way** (道 *Dào*) will not be practiced.

All who seek immortality should search for the **root of the Nine Heavens** (九天之根 *Jiǔtiān zhī gēn*), obtaining their **Primordial Essence** (本元 *Běnyuán*). The **Dao/Way** will be complete, and immortality will be achieved.

Yet the **true names of the Nine Heavenly Kings** (九天王秘讳 *Jiǔtiānwáng Mìhuì*) are hidden within the **Great Marvelous Palace above the Nine Heavens** (九天之上大有之宫 *Jiǔtiān zhī shàng Dàyǒu zhī gōng*), not passed down to the lower world. There exists the **Mysterious Celestial Imperial Diagram** (玄名帝图 *Xuánmíng Dìtú*), inscribed with **golden characters of the Highest Purity** (金字上清 *Jīnzì Shàngqīng*), which, when encountered in the **proper alignment of celestial cycles** (推运遇会 *Tuīyùn Yùhuì*), reveals the **Nine Heavenly Kings' names** (九天王名 *Jiǔtiānwáng míng

**Chapter One**
Abandon thoughts beyond the clouds,
Focus solely on the Yellow Peace.
Recite the *Taixiao* scripture,
And the Three Passes will naturally illuminate.

The Mysterious Ones linger in descent,
The Void dispatches flying cloud palanquins.
Though the Nine Heavens are profound and distant,
Wondrous contemplation shapes their form.

---

**Chapter Two: Supreme Meditation on the Infinite Life Heaven King’s Taixiao Golden Script**
The Void’s essence awakens, golden and pure,
Refining jade-like primordial essence.
The Law’s radiance shines in the Silent Court,
Mystical transformations unfold on their own.

Through countless kalpas, lost in the Nine Darks,
Bound by fate with the True One.
The Three Dawns announce to the Primordial Beginner,
As celestial cycles align, all is harmonized.

Reining the crimson reins aloft,
Flowing essence glows on jade branches.
Gazing into the Void yet seeing form,
Mingling like an infant—pure and unadorned.

Father Peace and Mother Essence,
Adrift in playful phoenix halls.
Descending glows in cloud chambers,
Who else could fathom such subtlety?

Uniting at the Parting Gate,
Bathing in the Purple Expanse.
If you seek to trace their path,
Study the Golden Script’s words.

Turning jade verses back,
The Heavenly King will surely know.
Preserve the Sovereign’s singular essence,
As the foundation for seeking immortality.

Cast aside all thoughts, still the mind—
Let spirit and heart remain tranquil.
Essence resonates, drawing True Ones near,
Their radiance shines resplendent.

Ascending seven ancestral roots,
All ascend to the clouded stages.
Jade scriptures gleam with high virtue,
Their brilliance defies comprehension.

Two marvels harmonize,
Yet each retains its own essence.
If you wish to play in the Nine Mysteries,
Simply recite the *Taixiao* text.
Ten thousand kalpas pass in an instant—
Fear not the heavens’ delay.

---

**Chapter Three: The Dharma-King’s Taixiao Golden Script**
Pure as the void, untainted,
Qi condenses into violet radiance.
The Crimson Expanse mirrors the Dharma-Heavens,
Laying out the Southern Return’s array.

The Three Dawns illuminate the celestial hosts,
Seven revolutions brighten the Great Enclosure.
Divine winds rush with strange perfumes,
Jade chimes weep a mournful dirge.

The Spirit Phoenix soars through jade forests,
Gathered immortals shake their feathered robes.
The Heavenly King rides the cycles’ command,
Holding the scepter, governing ten thousand affairs.

The Void Wheel trembles in the Empty Cavern,
Resounding through the Nine Heavens’ gate.
Escorting celestial guests from the Expanse,
Loosening robes to enter jade curtains.

Unfurling morning qi in splendor,
Illuminating jade steps with glory.
Eclipsing the Brahman’s crimson sun,
Wings of light embrace the spirit’s radiance.

Drifting within the Primordial Transformation,
Jade attendants linger in reverie.
The Prince bears the Tiger Talisman,
Summoning all spirits to return.

Eradicating the seven ancestral roots,
All wandering souls ascend as immortals.
The Golden Script rejoices in the Cloud Court,
Jade verses echo in the Hollow Void.

Refining the Dao’s daily brilliance,
A billion kalpas pass without decay.
Ten thousand transformations shift with fate—
Only the wondrous few comprehend.

Silent, the Heavenly King’s Taixiao Golden Script.

---

**Chapter Four**
Feasting in the Silent Court’s glade,
Whirlwinds spin the jade wheels.
The Crimson Expanse wings the green carriage,
The Spirit Official aids the Sovereign’s throne.

Obscured, the Nine Mysteries transform,
Scattered, the Paths of Departure open.
Lingering on the golden array,
Singing in celebration of the spirit clouds.

Three chants awaken the Mysterious,
Five cycles divide the Dao.
The Golden Chamber blazes grandly,
Flowing essence swirls in profusion.

Gazing left, seeing the peerless,
Gazing right, beholding the White Origin.
Treading the Auspicious Path of Yellow Offerings,
The Supreme One uplifts the Commanding Root.

Record my name in the Immortal Ledger,
Grant me the Degree of Life’s Text.
Singing the Pure, refining Heaven’s True Essence,
Silent contemplation unlocks the Hundred Passes.

The Sovereign’s One presides over the Spirit Temple,
The Law Robe flies in green silk.
Together, our pact needs no reckoning,
United at the Nine Heavens’ summit.

Though days may seem endless,
The Imperial Flower blooms in four cycles.
Deeply moved, I abandon all thoughts,
The Dao transmitted from the Mysterious.

Spirit responses follow their own fate—
True learning preserves all.
Unarrogant, joyful, the Heavenly King’s Taixiao.

---

**Chapter Five**
From the Void arises violet mist,
Pressing upon the Hua Palace.
Luminous currents follow fate’s return,
The Crimson Expanse mirrors the Green Chamber.

Winged support within the Empty Radiance,
Illuminating the Ten Directions with spirit glow.
Ten thousand emperors stem from True Movement—
None surpass the Nine Heavenly Kings.

Their forms naturally refined,
Qi uplifts the Void Palace.
Their transformations govern the Four Extremes,
Named the Ancestors of All Emperors.

Descending glows ride the Eight Mists,
Overseeing the Wheel of the Empty Cavern.
Morning excursions to the Western Hall,
Evening repose in the Mulberry Palace.

Summoning the Mysterious Diagram and Offerings,
Ascending the Green Flower Youth.
Peach and Kang stabilize the Fate Ledger,
Clarifying the Primordial Preservation of Kalpas.

Gazing without bound,
Ten thousand transformations flow with fate.
Reciting *Taixiao* in flight,
Seeking the Primordial Beginner’s traces.

Accumulating thought reaches the Silent,
Ascending to the Mysterious Window.
Host roots flow with lingering blessings,
Seven ancestors return to the Southern Palace.

The Five Sufferings are not trodden,
Friendship binds in the Great Void.
The Spirit Peak is no ordinary palace,
Flying clouds are my dragon.

Linked with the Nine Ridge True Ones,
偶景以成双。
Why sit in filth and squalor,
Waiting for fate’s exhaustion?

Echoing Response, the Heavenly King’s Taixiao.

---

**Chapter Six: High Virtue Refining the Empty Cavern**
Congealed qi forms crimson mist,
The Sovereign’s scepter turns the Nine Expanse.
Floating, the Heavenly Emperor’s True Form.
Jade terraces gleam on rocky heights,
Purple phoenixes cluster with jade unicorns.

Spirit songs drift from the Secluded Palace,
Desolate, the clouded ones above.
Escorted by seven reflections in the Chamber,
Golden arrays blaze in the Central Field.

The Heavenly King has nine ranks,
Flying immortals number in the myriads.
The Hollow Yang glows with spirit markers,
Omen the Degree of Life’s year.

The Crimson Flower shines on the Red Sun,
Fragrance spreads through the Omen Body.
Gazing upward, drinking the moon’s nectar,
Nine sources descend with liquid dew.

Forever preserved beyond the final kalpa,
Inner and outer voids remain pristine.
Accumulating thought senses the Great Space,
Piercing the Boundless Abyss.

Form merges with the Undifferentiated,
Feasting and wandering—none can circle back.

Jewel Treasure, the Heavenly King’s Taixiao.

---

**Chapter Seven**
The Three Dawns brighten the profound night,
Flowing phoenixes gleam on the golden sun.
The Crimson Chamber blazes grandly,
Spirit incense swirls in the jade hall.

The Prince unites in the Blessing Hall,
Treading Auspiciousness with the Sovereign’s One.
The Three Origins merge in the Palace,
Subtle words are most profound and secret.

Omening the year of Degree and Fate—
Silent contemplation knows no equal.

「Silent as though none exist,
Yet the True arises from the Void’s embrace.

Blessings overflow without end,
Seven Mysteries lift from obscurity’s grasp.

Accumulated merit rests on firm foundation,
Ancient roots all dissolve and vanish.

Jewel Scripture bears its wondrous verses,
This scroll must be guarded with reverence.

Preserve the sacred name in mind,
Dao descends as the One with the Mysterious.

---
**The Heavenly King’s Taixiao: *Lángshū Qióngwén* Chapter Eight**
Nine Mysteries pierce the Primordial *qi*,
Purple and white soar above the Jade Expanse.
Divine grace shines at the Golden Gate,
Spirit merges with the flourishing Jade branches.

The Hall of Purple Void stands open,
Auspicious clouds dissolve in transformation.
Echoes resound at the Soul’s threshold,
Law drums shake the Boundless Depths.

Feasting in the Mysterious Dawn’s brilliance,
Winds return, thin as the Spirit’s gust.
Reining the Nine Heavens beyond,
Driving with effortless *xiāoyáo* ease.

Wandering the Purple Morning’s peaks,
A guest is healed in the Jade Sovereign’s court.
Ten thousand kalpas pass in an instant,
Swiftly, the Two Forms unite.

The Void’s courtyard knows no measure,
Coming and going follow the boundless flow.
Great Transformation never alters its course,
The Three Dawns mark the profound and sacred.

Lángshū blesses the Spirit Hall,
Jewel Scripture harmonizes with the Pure Chant.

Refined elegance rises from the Mysterious,
Returning grace is not the False’s peak.

---
**Chapter Nine**
Mysterious *qi* weaves the Nine Expanse,
Purple Void radiates the Great Sun.
Flying Jade ascends the Radiant Keel,
Flowing Essence condenses as Jade Frost.

Heaven’s True rides the returning course,
Thin clouds flourish in the Mysterious Beam.
Darkly meeting in mutual resonance,
Crimson Expanse mirrors the Light’s passage.

Secret Appointment at the High Morning’s Palace,
Holding the Covenant in the Jade Capital.
Spirit Transformation surges through the Void,
Boundless currents reveal the Dark’s flow.

Flowing Fragrance veils the Crimson Sun,
Returning Wind swiftly bears the strange incense.
Dazzling brilliance at the Golden Gate,
Jewel Terrace emits the Jade Flower’s bloom.

Orchid Silk fills the Mysterious Valley,
Gazing upward, drinking the Six Palaces’ *chāng*.
The True departs, sensing the Silent Hall,
Mysterious thought pierces the Void’s realm.

Holding the Covenant in the Taixiao Hall,
Returning to the Jewel Scripture’s True Art.

---
*The Taixiao Lángshū Qióngwén Imperial Chapters*
All composed with Nine Mysteries’ subtle phrases,
The Nine Heavenly Kings inscribed in the Void’s emptiness,
Before the Primordial Origin,
Chanting the Mysterious to harmonize with Fate,
Feasting in the Auspicious Expanse,
Voices and sentences pure and subtle,
From the Mysterious arise the Spirit’s True Treasure—
Thus the Sacred Scroll is written.

To practice this Dao,
One must align with the Nine Heavens,
Preserve the sacred name in mind,
Store the Spirit and ponder the True,
Auspicious omens naturally manifest,
Ascending to the Dawn’s court.

All who cultivate this path
Must, on the days of their natal Eight Nodes,
Bathe in purity, fast in solemnity,
Enter the chamber at noon,
Face east and strike teeth nine times,
Store the Nine Heavens above,
Nine-hued flying clouds and luminous rays descending,
Enveloping the hall with dense radiance,
Softly invoke the Nine Heavenly Kings’ names,
Preserve the True Spirit in thought,
Then recite the *Taixiao Lángshū Qióngwén*’s nine chapters in full,
To bless the Auspicious Expanse,
Joy the Silent Hall,
Inspire the Nine Mysteries,
As the Law prescribes for nine years,
Ascending the Flying Scenery,
Feasting with the *xiāoyáo* reins.

If descending to the Nine Heavens’ feasting,
Observing the day when ten thousand spirits gather in Mysterious Assembly,
As above, bathe in purity, fast in solemnity,
Each at their appointed time recite the chapters in full,
Then the Nine Heavens shall record their names,
Distinguish them as True Ones,
Nine years without loss,
Ascending to the ranks of the High Immortals.

The Imperial Chapters all spring from the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Essence,
The Nine Heavenly Kings’ hidden inscriptions of Treasure Names,
Seals and scripts of Jade all revealed within.
To wear this Scripture,
One aligns with the Nine Heavens’ True,
Ten thousand spirits bow in homage,
All spirits guard and escort,
Power subdues the Heavenly Demons,
Movement knows no bounds,
Riding clouds, driving the Void,
Feasting in the Great Space.

This Scripture is subtle and wondrous,
The source of all Imperial Chapters.
To comprehend this Secret,
One becomes a King of the Immortals.
If one leaks or transmits lightly,
They perish in the Nine Abysses,
Punishment extends to seven generations,
Voids fill the River’s source,
A kalpa’s torment—
Guard it with utmost reverence.

---
*The Jewel Scripture’s Imperial Chapters, two hundred forty sounds,*
All the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Essence,
Ten thousand True’s hidden names—
Engrave on *zǎoxīn* wood,
Receive from the Absolute Cliff’s pure waters,
Apply to the Flying Silk cloth,
Face north and swear to the Nine Heavens,
Reverently accept the Nine Heavens’ Chapter.

Disciples hold the golden *jiǔliǎng*,
The purple script of ninety *chǐ*,
Face south and kneel,
While the Master reads the Jewel Scripture
And transmits it to the disciples.

If the Jewel Scripture has not yet been engraved,
Write with *cíhuáng* on green-blue silk,
Swear and transmit it,
Then gradually engrave the Scripture,
Swear on the mountain to the Nine Heavens.

If the Jewel Scripture is engraved on *zǎoxīn* wood,
Do not hang the seal toward the four directions,
Store it in a jade box in a separate chamber,
Face upward in reverence,
Burn incense morning and evening,
Pay homage to the Nine Heavenly Kings.

To summon the Eastern Celestial Officials,
Ask of auspicious and inauspicious omens,
The methods of communicating with the Spirit and attaining the True,
On *jiǎyǐ* days, face east and recite the Imperial Chapters once,
Then the Celestial Officials shall appear,
And speak with the True.

To summon the Southern Celestial Officials,
On *bǐngdīng* days, as above,
Then the Southern Celestial Officials shall appear,
And communicate with the True.

To summon the Western Celestial Officials,
On *gēngxīn* days, as above,
Then the Western Celestial Officials shall appear,
And speak with the True.

To summon the Northern Celestial Officials,
On *rénguǐ* days, as above,
Then the Northern Celestial Officials shall appear,
And communicate with the True.

To summon the Central Celestial Officials,
On *wùjǐ* days, as above,
Then the Central Celestial Officials shall appear,
And speak with the True.

All methods of summoning the Five Celestial Officials
Require facing the cardinal direction,
Striking teeth nine times,
Then reciting the Imperial Chapters.

With focused heart and solemn fasting,
No spirit shall fail to descend.
If the body is unclean,
The Mysterious and Dark remain unpenetrated,
Yet close the eyes and concentrate the thought,
No spirit shall escape sight.

Examine the Dark, probe the Mysterious,
Discern the omens of auspicious and inauspicious,
Nine years in True Form,
Entering the Void, emerging from the Nonexistent,
Feasting in the Jade Morning.

When the path is fully cultivated,
A True Person descends to welcome,
With cloud chariot and purple canopy.

The True must, with the Imperial Chapters’ seal,
Press on both soles and both hands,
To instantly manifest wings,
And ascend with the True together.»

If within the secluded and tranquil places of the Five Peaks,
You practice and recite with devotion,
And strange beings assume the True Form to descend
Into the chamber of the one who receives the **Dao/Way** (**兆**),
Then with the **Imperial Chapters’ seal** (**帝章之印**) toward them,
True and false shall instantly be revealed.

If they are True Persons or Celestial Officials,
The one who receives the **Dao/Way** (**兆**) shall bow respectfully and welcome them,
Present requests as desired,
And surely obtain their essential teachings.

If they are **demonic essences** (**魔精**),
They shall immediately revert to their original forms.

The one who receives the **Dao/Way** (**兆**) must strike teeth thirty-six times,
Recite the **Imperial Chapters** (**帝章**) once,
And the demon shall vanish—its essence and form destroyed—before the one who receives the **Dao/Way**.

Such methods must be performed with heart and mouth in harmony,
Never revealed to others.

If revealed to others, the **Dao/Way** is betrayed,
And the path shall not proceed.

When night falls, the one who receives the **Dao/Way** (**兆**) retires alone,
And must place the **Imperial Chapters** (**帝章**) upon their heart,
Then the **Supreme Celestial True Immortals** (**太霄真仙**) shall come to guard them,
Their form and essence resonating in dreams,
Conferring with the **True** (**真**), and within nine years,
They shall face the **True Person** (**真人**) directly.

All who receive the **Imperial Chapters’ seal** (**帝章之印**)
Must not recklessly disclose their visions to others.
If seen by three people, the **Dao/Way** is lost,
And its application shall fail.

All who practice this **Dao/Way** must be cautious,
Never to tread lightly upon **filth and impurity** (**殗秽**),
Lest they offend the **True Essences** (**真神**),
For such transgressions, within nine years,
Their bodies shall be tormented and punished.

If there are **Mysterious Diagrams and Imperial Chapters** (**玄图帝简**),
With **green characters and purple script** (**绿字紫书**),
And **golden bones and jade marrow** (**金骨玉髓**),
Named **Blue Palace Records** (**名书青宫**),
Then the **Nine Heaven Kings** (**九天王**) shall surely dispatch the **True Persons of the Four Extremes** (**四极真人**),
To descend and bestow upon the one who receives the **Dao/Way** (**兆**)
The **Jade Script Imperial Chapters** (**琼文帝章**).

If there is predestined affinity,
Or encounter with a **Clear and Illuminated Teacher** (**明师**),
Then it is a **Mysterious and Fortunate Alignment** (**玄挺运会**),
And they shall surely obtain this script,
Succeeding in ascending to the **Immortal Realm**.

They must bring **golden silk tokens of sincerity** (**赍金缯之信**),
Visit the Teacher in a **pure and solemn fast** (**清斋**),
And humbly receive instruction in practice.

If no **pledge of sincerity** (**信盟**) is offered,
The heavens shall not open their **spiritual responses** (**启灵**),
The **True** (**真**) shall not descend in rank,
And they shall never become Immortals.

If the Teacher **lightly transmits and discloses** (**轻泄**),
The punishment shall extend to the **Seven Ancestors** (**七祖**),
And they shall forever serve as **Ghostly Officials** (**鬼官**).
Thus, **Mysterious and Profound Secrets** (**明慎玄科**) must be kept guarded,
Never carelessly proclaimed.

In transmitting the *Supreme Celestial Jade Script Imperial Chapters* (**《太霄琅书琼文帝章》**),
The Teacher must be in a **high mountain void and silent** (**高山空寂**) space,
Spread a **flying net cloth** (**飞罗之巾**) to the north,
Place upon it **fragrant cakes, jujubes, and fruits** (**香饼枣果之物**),
And arrange them in a separate tray.
The **scripture** (**经**) must be placed atop the **flying net cloth**.

The Teacher, facing north, strikes teeth thirty-six times,
And respectfully presents the **Nine Souls of Primordial Essence** (**九灵元真**),
The **Supreme Celestial Officials** (**玄始上官**),
The **Golden Immortals and Jade Maidens** (**金仙玉女**),
The **Supreme Unity Spirit** (**太乙灵神**),
The **Direct Supervisors of the True** (**监真直司**),
And the **Assemblies of the Five Emperors** (**五帝众真**),
With the words:
*"Today, there is a Mr. [Peak Name] of [Peak Name] Peak,
With **purple veins binding his primordial cells** (**紫络结胞**),
And **predestined affinity for transcendence** (**宿命挺仙**),
Bringing **golden silk tokens of sincerity** (**赍金缯之信**),
Seeking to receive the **Sacred Script** (**灵文**),
The **Nine Heaven True Taboo Jade Script Imperial Chapters** (**九天真讳琼文帝章**).
The **Heavenly Secrets** (**天科**) are solemnly guarded,
And I swear by the **Sacred Essences** (**灵真**),
That I wish to **revolve the Divine Light** (**迂神光**) and **illuminate the Mysterious** (**玄映**) upon this disciple.
Should there be a day of disclosure,
I shall return my body to the **Yellow River’s source** (**河源**),
And the **Seven Ancestors** (**七祖**) shall apologize for my fault,
Daring never again to ascend as Immortal."*

Upon completion,
The **scripture and chapters** (**经章**) are handed to the disciple.
Then,
The **fragrant cakes and fruits** (**饼果**) are buried within the **Mysterious Peak** (**玄岳**),
And must not be used for other purposes.

This is the **Nine Heaven Kings’ esoteric mystery** (**秘奥**), the **Supreme True’s** (**太真**) subtle technique (**妙诀**).
The **practitioners of cultivation** (**修学之士**), lacking this **Heavenly Secret** (**天科**),
Merely toil in vain among the **empty mountains** (**空山**),
And find no resonance in the **silent halls** (**寂庭**).

With **earnest devotion** (**笃志**) and **diligence in reflection** (**勤向思念**),
Pondering the **Nine Mysterious Principles** (**九玄**),
The **Heavenly Kings** (**天王**) moved by gratitude,
Send forth **Jade Boys and Jade Girls** (**玉童玉女**) as attendants to escort my form (**兆身**),
Within **nine years** (**九年**), attaining the **Celestial Conveyance** (**飞琼**),
Ascending to the **Nine Heavens** (**九天**).

The **Sacred Script of the Nine Heaven True Taboo Jade Chapters** (**九天真讳琼文帝章**)—
A **lofty celestial inscription** (**太霄琅书**)—
Is now **completed** (**竟**).
