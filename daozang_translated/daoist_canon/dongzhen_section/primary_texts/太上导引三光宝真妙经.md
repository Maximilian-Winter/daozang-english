**The Supreme Scripture of Daoist Guidance Through the Three Lights and Nine Transformations**

In the primordial antiquity, the Most High Sages, the Limitless Heavenly Perfected Ones, the Mysterious Harmony Spirit Consort, and the Radiant Jade Maiden, together with the thirty-two Heavenly Lords and Heavenly Emperors, the Heavenly Perfected Great Spirits, the Numinous Treasure Perfected Ones, the hosts of all heavenly immortals, immortal youths and jade maidens, the true officials of the sun and moon, the arrayed luminaries and stars, the boundless celestial attendants, and the wandering immortals dwelling within the sun, moon, and stars—at the time of the true *qi* of the Great Yang, during the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months, they draw the essence of the sun with the left hand and the soul of the moon with the right, gazing upward to pay homage to the myriad sages and bowing downward to receive the radiance of the constellations. Thus they cultivate the Dao of the True Constant of Stabilizing Light.

Its names are eight: the first is *Flowing Essence*, the second *Lustrous Infant*, the third *Dharma Qi*, the fourth *Yang Jade*, the fifth *Cloud Blossom*, the sixth *Daoist Immortal*, the seventh *Nine Transformations*, and the eighth *Stabilizing Light*.

When this Dao is fully accomplished, one returns to the true and constant. Rising and descending with the *qi*, one merges with the mysterious Dao, neither born nor extinguished, enduring for countless kalpas. All the true immortals of the heavens delight in its practice. The Lord of the Sun, the Emperor of the Moon, and the true officials of the stellar lodges also constantly engage with it; none fail to marvel at the Dao of the True Constant.

The primordial *qi* exhales the celestial flowing essence, rinses the *Lustrous Infant*, extends the *Dharma Qi*, guides and governs the *Yang Jade*, refines the *Cloud Blossom*, transforms and evolves the *Daoist Immortal*, transcends through the *Nine Transformations*, the body generating wondrous radiance, the hands revolving the *Stabilizing Light*, leaping in reflection through the great void, ascending beyond the Three Realms, forever escaping birth and death, and soaring to the Upper Palaces.

The Five Venerable Great Sages and the Perfected Ones of all heavens guide the *Flowing Essence* of the Three Lights. At that time, one hundred and twenty-five Perfected Ones recite and chant the eight concordant sounds of the Dharma.

The wondrous Dao divides into one *qi*,
Within the *qi*, yin and yang part.
Congealing, they transform into the sun, moon, and stars,
Resplendent, they flow as the Three Lights.
The Nine Blossoms contain the Nine Daos,
The Eight Colors delight the Eight Directions.
Brilliant, they illuminate the true body of the Cavern,
The flowing essence returns to the Great Vastness.
Below, it generates the Abyssal Spring Palace,
Above, it arrays the Realm of Non-Where.
The body released, traces take flight,
Suddenly, all is forgotten.
The Seven Treasures form the flowing essence,
Chaos intermingles with fragrant blossoms.
Swallowing the *Nine Clouds Powder*,
This joy knows no end.

When the guidance of the *Flowing Essence* and the recitation of the concord are complete, ingest the three talismans.

The Five Venerable Great Sages and the Perfected Ones of all heavens guide the *Lustrous Infant* of the Three Lights. At that time, one hundred and twenty-five Perfected Ones recite and chant the eight concordant sounds of the Dharma.

Within the profound and absolute nine *qi*,
The *Lustrous Infant* arises from the Great Non-Being.
The *Yuyi* shines in the Valley of the Sun,
The *Jielin* radiates upon the celestial thoroughfare.
The Five Stars stream forth precious light,
The Dipper and Pole revolve the celestial pivot.
Flying *qi* billows and scatters,
Swallowing and guiding, one lingers in hesitation.
Transcending traces upon the Stairway of Heavenly Treasures,
Refining the magic mushrooms and ingesting blossoms.
*Qi* spreads, the myriad spirits are complete,
The body ascends into the Great Void.

When the guidance of the *Lustrous Infant* and the recitation of the concord are complete, ingest the three talismans.

Misty and dense, it congeals in the mysterious center.
The Two Luminaries together become limpid,
The Five Wefts interpenetrate.
The Three Lights shine resplendently,
Precious *qi* fills the Three Palaces.
The Imperial Realm gathers the Nine Elders,
Swallowing and ingesting, the hundred bones flourish.
Golden blossoms illuminate the Mirror of Light,
The body becomes one with the sun and moon.
Contemplating the Dao before the Upper Sages,
For ten thousand kalpas, life knows no end.

The true *qi* of *Yang Jade* is upright,
The wondrous Dao divides the Three Radiant Ones.
The Mysterious Harmony chants the numinous sound,
The Eight Harmonies unfold the jade script.
The Five Elders darkly dwell in the cinnabar abode,
Floating, they ride the radiant clouds.
The Great Sages and hosts of all heavens,
Mount dragons and drink the Jade Nectar.
The Three and Five determine the register of life,
Playing and frolicking as guests of the Most High.
The blossoming light shines boundlessly,
Hand in hand, they pay homage at the dawn of the Emperor.

When the guidance of *Yang Jade* and the recitation of the concord are complete, ingest the three talismans.

The Five Venerable Great Sages and the Perfected Ones of all heavens guide the *Cloud Blossom* of the Three Lights. At that time, one hundred and twenty-five Perfected Ones recite and chant the eight concordant sounds of the Dharma.

Drawing *qi* beyond the *Yu Luo*,
The Nine Rays congeal into *Cloud Blossom*.
The Seven Spirits ascend the Highest Dao,
The Three Radiant Ones illuminate the vermilion clouds.
Offering incense and ingesting the morning essence,
When merit is complete, the worldly net is undone.
Refining and transforming, the dust’s bonds are exhausted,
A hundred million years are as nothing.
The register falls in the court of the Three Realms,
Friendship is formed with the household of the Most High.
Riding the radiance and controlling the mysterious reins,
What need is there for the Eight Extremities?

The Dao of the utmost true and natural,
Most wondrous, the mystery within mystery.
The myriad heavens pay homage at the Jade Steps,
The Nine Elders attend the Blossoming Pavilion.
The Three Lights possess numinous *qi*,
Only the sagely and worthy are delivered.
Diligently practicing the work of guiding immortals,
Swallowing and ingesting, one consumes the blossoming root.
Spirit and form unite with the Three Images,
Vast and distant, they return to the original source.
The august birds soar through the Ten Heavens,
Taking flight without a backward glance.

Far, far above the Three Heavens,
Lofty, lofty is the Terrace of the Nine Mysteries.
True youths gather magic mushrooms,
Jade maidens return bearing flowers.
Heavenly guests receive the immortal visitors,
Looking up and down, they ascend the jasper steps.
The Celestial River lies at the Eastern Well,
Precious *qi* coils through the void.
Swallowing and rinsing the jade nectar,
For countless kalpas, one does not decline.
Raising the head toward the path of the Three Clarities,
Shaking out one’s robes—what joy!

The Dao of the Supreme Perfected is supreme indeed,
Wondrous are the chapters of the Numinous Treasure.
Drawing in the radiance, one guides the Five Stars,
Swallowing and inhaling, one visualizes their effulgent rays.
Flowing essence bathes the hundred bodies,
Luminous and crystalline as congealed frost and snow.
The cavernous illumination shines within and without,
All dross and dust utterly vanish.
The flesh flourishes, never to age again,
Attaining this is called *Stabilizing Light*.
Forever feasting in the Palace of Great Clarity,
This is the Land of Unending Day.
Gathering one’s traces to return to the root,
The Nine Transformations congeal true constancy.

When the guidance of *Stabilizing Light* and the recitation of the concord are complete, ingest the three talismans.

After ingesting the talismans and bowing to the Perfected,
Guide the body, swallow *qi*,
The Two Radiances merge as one,
The Three Lights converge in harmony.
My body transcends,
Uniting with the light as one.
In response, it returns to being;
In stillness, it enters non-being.
Roaming the Great Void,
Hidden or manifest, boundless.
Through this freedom,
One becomes the Perfect Person of Natural Spontaneity,
Also named the *Stabilizing Light Perfected of the Thirty-Two Heavens of the Primordial Beginning, the Five Venerables, and the Numinous Treasure*.

Ever in the company of the Ten Poles’ Great Sages,
The Ten Flowered Lofty Perfected,
The Four Heavenly Thearchs,
The Five Venerable Lords of the Dao,
Attended by a thousand Perfected and ten thousand spirits,
And the officials of the Three Realms,
They wander and rest in the Gates of Cavernous Yang,
Within the Terrace of Absolute Contemplation.
Here lie the Heaven of August Antiquity,
The Heaven of Harmonious Yang,
The Heaven of Ascending Perfection,
The Heaven of Cloud-Crossing—
Each of the Four Heavens contains thirty-six lands,
Each land has its lords and ministers, its territories,
Its people and emperors,
Its avian Kunlun,
Its Jasper Capital and Golden Palaces,
Its Mysterious Metropolis and Five Marchmounts,
Its divine bureaus of immortals,
Its great marshes and famed mountains,
Its Eight Mighty Spirit-Beasts,
All creatures that fly and dive, swim and soar,
Scales and shells, feathers and fur,
Hills and forests, all that wriggles and stirs,
Transformed into the Seven Treasures,
Illuminating the four directions.
The Dharma drums shake the heavens,
The numinous sounds harmonize in concert,
Singing the chapters of the Eight Assemblies of the Most High.

Those newly initiated into learning as Immortals,
Who gain the privilege to observe and listen,
Ascend the cosmic net and fly through the records,
Following the records, they revolve through the Dipper and enter the Ladle,
Swallowing the primordial, ingesting essence,
Fusing spirit with the wondrous,
Hands turning the Six Perfections,
Feet treading the Nine Flowers,
Body soaring into the void,
Merging with the radiance as one,
Forever ascending the wondrous Dao,
Preserved eternally beyond heaven.

The Heaven of Jade Perfection,
The Heaven of Reverent Splendor,
The Heaven of August Cliff,
The Heaven of Primordial Cavern—
Here stands the Terrace of Vast Yang and Mysterious Origin,
Where the Perfected of the Nine Transformations ascend.

The Heaven of Harmonious Youth,
The Heaven of Ancestral Drift,
The Heaven of Ultimate Wind,
The Heaven of Wondrous Completion—
Here stand the Forest of Jade Splendor and the Terrace of Cloud-Soaring,
Where the Perfected of Guiding Immortals ascend.

The Heaven of Level Nurturing,
The Heaven of August Reed,
The Heaven of Filial Radiance,
The Heaven of Forbidden Heights—
Here stands the Terrace of Mysterious Prosperity and Treasure,
Where the Perfected of Cloud Splendor ascend.

The Heaven of Literary Elevation,
The Heaven of Hallowed Radiance,
The Heaven of Venerable Weight,
The Heaven of Constant Fusion—
Here stands the Terrace of Returning Yin and Great Perfection,
Where the Perfected of Jade Yang ascend.

The Heaven of Seven Luminaries,
The Heaven of Upright Serenity,
The Heaven of River Origin,
The Heaven of Soaring Victory—
Here stands the Terrace of Cloud-Formed Numinous Flight,
Where the Perfected of Dharma *Qi* ascend.

The Heaven of Crossing the Scales,
The Heaven of Reverent Celebration,
The Heaven of Upper Divination,
The Heaven of Brahmanic Crossing—

Where the Perfected of Overflowing Essence ascend.

The Heaven of Concealing Mist,
The Heaven of Ultimate Jade,
The Heaven of Vow-Swearing,
The Heaven of Gambling—
Here stands the Terrace of Ten Absolutes and Nine Flowers,
Where the Perfected of Flowing Essence ascend.

These eight terraces are where the Perfected of the Three Lights,
The Heavenly Kings of the Four Heavens,
And the various Perfected Ones ascend to wander and feast.
The celestial texts and jade scriptures,
Carved in jade characters,
Are kept within these terraces,
Named the *Mandates of the Eight Heavens of the Primordial Beginning*.

Those who guide and lead revere and ingest,
Transforming their substance and altering their form,
Refining the body of conditioned existence,
To enter the Dao of formlessness.

During cultivation,
One retreats to a separate chamber to visualize the Dao,
Purifying with fasts and cutting off from dust.
In the months of the Six Yang,
The Six *Qi* are proclaimed in harmony,
And the Celestial Perfected respond.
Or upon sacred mounds and immortal peaks,
With mind serene and intent focused,
One may instantly ascend and commune.
If dwelling among the common folk,
Such resonance is indeed difficult to achieve.

The Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning,
The Most High Lord of the Great Dao,
The Most High Lord Lao,
The Five Venerable Lords of the Dao,
The True Kings of the Four Poles,
The Nine Heavenly Thearchs,
The Four Heavenly Kings,
The Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors,
The Ten Flowered Perfected of the Most High,
The Lords of the Three Origins—
They record and govern the host of sages,
All the revered spirits.
Each month, they guide the Three Lights.
The Three Lights open the mysterious,
The upright *qi* is proclaimed and circulates,
The celestial measures are balanced and just,
The Eight Winds are without error.
Then they command the host of Perfected Immortals and officials
To pay homage to the Four Directions’ Lord of the Dao, the Heavenly Worthy,
Who manifests in response to devotion,
His divine radiance blazing,
To aid the brightness of the sun and moon.

Those who cultivate this Dao
Should, in their fasting chambers,
Morning and evening, visualize and pay reverence,
Hoping for resonance and communion.
