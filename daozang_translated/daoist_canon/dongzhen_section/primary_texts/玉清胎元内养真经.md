**The Jade Purity Womb-Origin Internal Cultivation Scripture**
Transmitted by the Perfected Sovereign of the Jade Purity Treasure-Spirit Primordial Terrace

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao, having attended the court of the Primordial Celestial Venerable, was addressed thus:

"When essence is depleted, it flames upward; when qi is depleted, it flees downward. Yin and yang each course through water and fire, while metal and wood fail to unite as husband and wife. Thus, those below and above suffer daily decline of true qi, daily perversion of yin evil, their original lifespan truncated, their spirit and essence incomplete, sinking into the ranks of lesser ghosts.

I shall now transmit to you the wondrous Dao of the womb-origin, whereby the external Mysterious Female (Xuanpin) merges with the internal Mysterious Female, the external true spirit supplements the internal true qi, and the myriad treasures of heaven are gathered to nourish the primordial essence of my womb. Thus, spirit is born of the womb, qi clings to spirit, the Heart-Monarch steers in concealment, and the breath is harmonized and even. The ten thousand spirits pay reverence, and the host of demons restrain their forms.

You shall teach the multitudes first to cultivate a settled mind. When the mind is settled, qi abides; when qi abides, spirit is whole; when spirit is whole, form is firm. Subtly continuous, as if present yet unceasing, its use is inexhaustible and its efficacy manifest. The Valley Spirit (Gushen) does not die, and one merges with my true lineage.

I pity the people of the world, outwardly ravaged by wine and lust, inwardly ensnared by cares and anxieties. They covet fame and profit, dissipating their spirit and essence, clinging to powdered corpses and the artful smiles of moth-browed beauties. Chasing externals, they lose their root; their spiritual foundation crumbles. The soil of Kan and Li scatters, causing the hun and po to drift apart. Children and grandchildren multiply, while the bodily frame gradually decays. Reduced to a clod of earth in a single coffin, they forfeit the true mechanism of heaven and earth—how lamentable!

Exhort the people first to uphold minor precepts, advancing to the great precepts, and first to learn the stilling of the mind. Gradually enter non-action; from stillness arises illumination, and from illumination, enlightenment of the Dao.

The superior class of persons, refining the coarse into the subtle, attain a luminous body and dwell in the Pure and Clear Heaven, their lifespan boundless.

The middling class of persons prolong their years in the world, replenishing and restoring their womb-origin, avoiding premature harm.

The inferior class of persons distance themselves from passions and desires, diminish their pursuit of profit and fame, turn toward the true wind, and follow the sagely teachings.

You shall disseminate my wondrous words in myriad forms, circulating and instructing far and wide. Gradually guide them to abandon the perverse and return to the correct, to discard the turbid and retain the pure, and to realize the supreme Dao."

Thereupon, the Most High Lord Lao reverently received the sagely instructions and, together with the Purple Radiance Heavenly Mother, each transformed their forms into countless multitudes, dividing their bodies throughout the world to universally deliver sentient beings. Before long, in the twelve thousand heavens above, within lotus blossoms, innumerable celestial beings were transformed and born. Each rode the void to the Jade Purity Realm, facing the Perfected Venerable, and recited the following ode:

*"Supreme Divine Father, who opens the great expedient means,
Commands the Most High and the Purple Radiance Heavenly Mother.
Transforming forms below, they broadly deliver us all.
Through precepts and meditative concentration, we all ascend above,
Attaining the mind-born body and realizing the supreme Dao.
We transform into hundreds of thousands of myriad forms,
Each body possessing ten thousand tongues to praise the mysterious virtue.
Even after hundreds of thousands of myriad kalpas, it cannot be exhausted.
Vast and towering, its merit is unfathomable.
We receive this with faith—how may we repay it?
We vow to generate the great resolve, in future kalpas,
To deliver sentient beings once more.
This single mind alone is called the repayment of virtue."*

The boundless celestial beings recited this wondrous ode and scattered celestial flowers and precious incense into the void as offerings. Gazing afar at the Perfected Venerable, they withdrew after a hundred prostrations.
