**Preface to *Master Cui’s Mirror for Ingredient Alchemy with Annotations***

The study of immortality is not something the common man or vulgar scholar may hear of. Only those of great root and capacity—resolute men, keen-eyed and lofty scholars—may pursue it.

What, then, do learners and practitioners seek? Externally, they fathom the principles by which Heaven and Earth bestow transformation; internally, they clarify the mechanisms by which body and mind operate. Yet even so, had Confucius not received personal instruction from Laozi, he would not have sighed in awe of the "dragon’s mystery." Had the Buddha not been the ancient sage reborn, how could he have attained his transcendent vision? Thus, though learners are as numerous as ox hairs, those who achieve mastery are as rare as qilin horns. This is no other reason than whether one receives the true transmission or not.

The study of immortality is nothing more than refining nature and life, returning to the root and restoring the source. One gathers the primordial *qi* as the mother of the elixir and circulates the postnatal *qi* to conduct the firing process. Refining nature with fire ensures the golden spirit remains indestructible; refining life with fire ensures the Dao’s *qi* endures forever. Exchanging the impure yin body for a purely yang form, one attains spiritual transformation and boundless responsiveness—how wondrous!

I observe that those who study immortality today are many, yet when I debate the true oral instructions with them, each clings to their own biased views, none aligning with the orthodox transmission of the ancient masters. Upon examining *Master Cui’s Mirror for Ingredient Alchemy*—eighty-two verses, concise in words yet exhaustive in meaning, threading through the marrow of all alchemical classics—I, unworthy as I am, have added annotations beneath every four lines, drawing from my teacher’s oral instructions to reveal the profound mechanism and serve as a guide for humanity and heaven. Those who come after and share my aspirations may ponder and recite these words with care; without doubt, they will experience divine enlightenment and heartfelt realization.

Some may say my annotations are untrustworthy, while Master Cui’s words alone should be taken as truth. Follow them, trust them, and refine your entire being—then the work of learning immortality is complete.

**Annotations to *Master Cui’s Mirror for Ingredient Alchemy* by Master Hunran**

**Primordial *qi*, postnatal *qi*—**
**Those who attain it are ever as if drunk.**

Primordial *qi* is the original ancestral *qi*. This ancestral *qi* resides at the center of the human body’s Heaven and Earth, within the vital gate and secret chamber, suspended at the highest point—this is the Heavenly Heart. In the practice of immortality, one only gathers this primordial *qi* as the mother of the elixir.

Postnatal *qi* is the *qi* of each inhalation and exhalation, each departure and return, internally circulating. Exhaling connects to the root of Heaven; inhaling connects to the root of Earth. Exhaling, the dragon roars and clouds arise; inhaling, the tiger howls and winds stir. Subtly sustained, it returns to merge with the ancestral *qi*, uniting inner and outer to congeal the returning elixir. One feels the fire in the cinnabar field blazing, coursing through the four limbs—stuporous as if drunk, yet bliss abounds within.

As the *Daodejing* states: *"The valley spirit does not die; it is called the Mysterious Female. The gateway of the Mysterious Female is the root of Heaven and Earth. Subtly sustained, it seems ever-present; its use is never exhausted."*

The *Book of Changes*, in the *Kun* hexagram, says: *"Yellow at the center, it penetrates principle; rightly positioned, it embodies form. Beauty resides within, coursing through the four limbs."* This is what is meant here.

**The sun has its conjunctions, the moon has its conjunctions.**
**Exhaust *wu* and *ji*, determine *geng* and *jia*.**

The sun and moon are the Great Yang and Great Yin. Heaven has the ecliptic as its measure, three hundred sixty-five and a quarter degrees. In its revolution, it completes one cycle each day. The sun and moon move within it, ascending and descending, alternating in their comings and goings—thus dividing day and night and fixing cold and heat.

At the winter solstice, the first yang arises in *Fu*; the sun moves northward, the moon southward. At the summer solstice, the first yin arises in *Gou*; the sun moves southward, the moon northward. The sun travels one degree per day, meeting the Great Yin after thirty degrees. The moon has no light of its own but borrows the sun’s radiance. It moves slightly over twelve degrees per day, completing a full cycle of Heaven’s degrees in thirty days. Each month at the dark and new moons, it meets the sun in the same palace of its path—sun and moon conjoin, the dark moon like the year’s end, the new moon like the year’s beginning. They meet, then part; part, then reunite.

The moon receives its brightness from the sun; the yang spirit gradually grows while the yin essence gradually wanes. By the eighth night, yang and yin are equal, forming the first quarter. By the fifteenth night, it faces the sun directly, becoming full—hence its roundness. At the peak of fullness, the principle dictates it must wane. Thus, the yin essence gradually grows while the yang spirit gradually wanes. By the twenty-third night, yin and yang are equal again, forming the last quarter. By the thirtieth night, it is dark, once more meeting the sun. This is Heaven’s "the sun has its conjunctions, the moon has its conjunctions."

Turning inward to the body, our body is a Heaven and Earth, also possessing sun and moon. Taking the body as Qian and Kun, Kan and Li serve as the medicinal ingredients; the movements of the sun and moon serve as the firing times. The common people use these daily yet remain unaware—how could they know how to practice?

Our body is no different from Heaven and Earth and the sun and moon. When making the elixir, one operates the dual wheels of the sun and moon, gathering yin and yang in a single breath. The sun and moon return to the crucible; yin and yang unite their essences. Refining and smelting them, the sacred embryo is formed. This is the body’s "the sun has its conjunctions, the moon has its conjunctions."

Master Liaozhen said: *"The Jade Pool constantly drips the marrow of yin and yang; the Golden Crucible ever refines the essence of the sun and moon."* This is the meaning.

Having understood the conjunctions of the sun and moon, one must exhaust the source of *wu* and *ji*. *Wu* and *ji* are the central earth.

Water and fire divide into above and below; wood and metal array in east and west. Wood is the mother of fire, metal the mother of water. Without the work of *wu* and *ji*, water and fire cannot achieve harmony, nor can metal and wood merge as one.

At the moment of transformation, one employs *wu*-earth rising from *kan*, advancing with the yang fire; *ji*-earth descends from *li*, retreating with the yin tally. Drawing back the Four Images into the same crucible—this is the work of *wu* and *ji*.

Having exhausted the principle of *wu* and *ji*, one must determine the directions of *geng* and *jia*. *Geng* is the west, metal, emotion, the tiger. *Jia* is the east, wood, nature, the dragon. Human emotion tends toward reckless pursuit, chasing after every sight like a raging tiger, thus often harming nature. When nature is deluded by emotion, it cannot govern, like a dragon in wild flight—hence the two remain estranged.

For the great cultivator, restraint is not difficult. At this very moment, one should apply effort, relying on the Yellow Dame to mediate, turning the handle of the Dipper’s mechanism. In a single breath, metal and wood return to union, emotion and nature become one, dragon and tiger enter the crucible, and the heart becomes empty and serene—this is how one determines *geng* and *jia*.

The marvelous work of the elixir school lies precisely in generating *jia* and *geng*; the scholar must not remain ignorant of this.

**Above the Magpie Bridge, below the Magpie Bridge.**
**Heaven responds with stars, earth responds with tides.**

The human spine is likened to the Milky Way of heaven. The Milky Way is a barrier, yet the divine magpie builds a bridge—hence the saying of the Magpie Bridge. The tongue is also called the Magpie Bridge. When making the elixir, the Yellow Dame guides the Infant upward to the Mud Pill Palace to meet the Maiden, called the "upper Magpie Bridge." The Yellow Dame then lingers, smiling as she leads the Infant and Maiden together back to the Grotto Chamber, descending from the Mud Pill Palace—hence the "lower Magpie Bridge."

The Yellow Dame, Infant, and Maiden are not real entities; they are metaphors, nothing beyond the three of body, heart, and intent. In silent practice, one relies internally on the Celestial Pivot’s turning, externally on the Dipper’s handle to push and shift. When kindling the fire, one feels true *qi* surging upward like the first swell of the tide, flowing directly against the current—thus "heaven responds with stars, earth responds with tides."

As the *Elixir Canon* states: *"The work is easy, the medicine not far—stir the celestial wheel, and earth responds with tides."*

**Stir the *xun* wind, move the *kun* fire.**
**Enter the Yellow Chamber, form the supreme treasure.**

The method of making the elixir is to refine the true lead and true mercury within one’s body. When lead encounters the moment of *gui*’s birth, one must stir the *xun* wind, fan open the furnace bellows, and move the fire of the *kun* palace to sink below. Draw out the yang from *kan* to replenish the yin in *li*, forming the image of *qian*, then return to rest in the *kun* position. In an instant, the fire is kindled for smelting; lead becomes clear, mercury pure, coalescing into the empty golden embryo, indestructible through kalpas—this is how one enters the Yellow Chamber to form the supreme treasure.

As the *Scripture of Salvation* says: *"Within, regulate the five *qi*, blend the hundred spirits; ten revolutions restore numinosity, and the myriad *qi* ascend as immortals."*

Xiao Tingzhi said: *"The great medicine consists of three: essence, *qi*, and spirit. Naturally, mother and child embrace; the returning wind blends into the true body, and the work of refinement renews day by day."* Such is the way.

**Water fears drying, fire fears cold.**
**A hair’s breadth off, and the elixir fails.**

The essentials of inner refinement: the water in the crucible must not dry, the fire in the furnace must not grow cold. As the *Elixir Canon* says: *"The golden crucible ever holds warm broth and fire; the jade furnace must not be allowed to grow cold."*

Speaking of external elixirs, when making the elixir, one performs the work of martial and civil refinement, the key being to harmonize the fire’s intensity. If applied excessively, the fire scorches and water overflows; if insufficient, water dries and fire chills. The practice lies in pausing at the right moment—one revolution of the celestial cycle—and water and fire achieve harmony, the elixir naturally forming within the crucible. A hair’s breadth off, and the elixir fails.

The immortal master said: *"The medicine has degrees of maturity, the fire has its measures—scholars must not remain ignorant."* Liaozhenzi said: *"Seven returns, nine refinements—know the master; the work admits not a hair’s error."*

As the *Awakening to Reality* states: *"All depends on the power of cultivation; a hair’s difference, and the elixir will not form."*

**Lead-dragon ascends, mercury-tiger descends.**
**Drive the two creatures—do not let them roam free.**

Lead is the single point of true yang within *kan*, called the dragon. Mercury is the single point of true yin within *li*, called the tiger. When making the elixir, one flies *wu*-earth to draw out the lead from *kan*; wood generates fire, which blazes upward to the Mud Pill Palace—the dragon emerges from fire—hence "lead-dragon ascends." One employs *ji*-earth to gather the mercury from *li*; metal generates water, which flows downward to the Cinnabar Field—the tiger is born in water—hence "mercury-tiger descends."

The work of capture requires the force of martial fire, or the lead-dragon will not ascend; the force of civil fire, or the mercury-tiger will not descend. In a single breath, the circulation is wondrous in its firmness and strength. With effort, one seizes the dragon and tiger, driving them into the crucible to be refined into royal nectar—thus "drive the two creatures, do not let them roam free."

Zhang Ziyang said: *"The White Tiger of the western mountains is wild in nature; the Azure Dragon of the eastern sea cannot be withstood. Seize them with both hands and make them fight to the death, refining them into a lump of purple gold frost."*

**Born in *kun*, planted in *qian*.**

Only through utmost sincerity does one follow the natural Way.

Zhang Ziyang said: *"To know where the medicine is born—its source and homeland—look only to the southwest."* This refers to the southwest region of the body, the position of *kun*. The human abdomen is *kun*, the head is *qian*; *kun* below becomes the furnace, *qian* above the crucible. The great elixir of the Golden Pill is born in *kun* and planted in *qian*.

When refining the pill and gathering the medicine, one must begin from the *kun* position, sinking into the tail cavity for gentle nurturing. Upon seeing the dragon, apply martial fire to drive the true yang qi upward, reversing its course to *qian*’s *gou* palace, then returning to *kun* to halt—fiercely refining and forging to congeal the supreme treasure. Thus it is said: *born in kun, planted in qian.*

There is also the moment when the medicine is born in the primordial state: observing the mind, absorbing the spirit, holding fast without leakage—all to assist the power of the fire’s timing. Ancient immortals often kept this secret, for it is the highest mechanism; who among men knows it? In practice, one must maintain sincerity. Engage in the "wild battle" with vigilance against danger, modeling heaven and earth, responding and transforming naturally. Thus it is said: *only through utmost sincerity does one follow the natural Way.*

Steal from heaven and earth, seize the workings of creation. Pierce the five phases, unite the eight trigrams. Uphold heaven and earth, grasp yin and yang, gather the five phases, harmonize the eight trigrams—this is the study of immortals.

Heaven and earth are *qian* and *kun*. Creation is the field of yin and yang. The five phases are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The eight trigrams are *qian*, *kun*, *kan*, *li*, *zhen*, *xun*, *gen*, and *dui*. Yet how, with what art, can one steal from the vastness of heaven and earth, seize the depths of creation, gather the dispersed five phases, and unite the arrayed eight trigrams?

*Steal* means to secretly take; *seize* means to forcibly acquire; *gather* means to cluster; *unite* means to merge. This speaks of the alchemical method, whose subtleties are transmitted orally. The true technique of elixir-making lies in a mere trifling mechanism. When the time arrives and qi transforms, the medicine is born and the spirit knows—then one must close the wind gate, seal the *gen* door, turn the celestial pivot, rotate the Dipper’s handle, and circulate the fire of the tally in a single breath. Gather the three thousand six hundred breaths of true qi, reverse the seventy-two seasonal nodes, invert the five phases, harmonize the eight trigrams, and return all to the earthen crucible, sealing it firmly. Soon, regulate the fire’s intensity, apply martial refinement and fierce forging, and congeal the sacred embryo. Thus, in a single moment of effort, one seizes a year’s seasonal cycle.

The *Elixir Canon* states: *"When the human mind aligns with the mind of heaven, inverting yin and yang takes but an instant."* This is how a single inhalation and exhalation can seize creation. A person has thirteen thousand five hundred inhalations and thirteen thousand five hundred exhalations in a day. Each breath—one inhalation and one exhalation—constitutes a single cycle, and in that cycle, one subtly seizes the movement of heaven for thirteen thousand five hundred years. In a year of three hundred sixty days and four million six hundred eighty thousand breaths, one subtly seizes the movement of heaven for four million eight hundred sixty thousand years. Thereby, the impure yin body is entirely transformed into a purely yang form—spiritually free, gathering to take shape, dispersing to become wind, emerging into being and vanishing into nothingness, hidden and revealed beyond measure. Is this not wondrous?

True water, true fire. When water and fire merge, one never ages.

Water resides in the north, corresponding to *kan* in the trigrams and the kidneys in the body. Fire resides in the south, corresponding to *li* in the trigrams and the heart in the body. Fire is hidden within water, water within fire. The single drop of true fluid in the heart is true water; the single spark of true yang in the kidneys is true fire. Water and fire, separated above and below—how can they merge? Only by borrowing the true earth of *wu* and *ji* to restrain and drive them, causing true fire to ascend and true water to descend, both returning to the earthen crucible. With water and fire in harmony, the Golden Pill is congealed, and a single breath of pure yang aligns one’s lifespan with heaven’s. Thus it is said: *when water and fire merge, one never ages.*

Water flows, fire flames. Within the body, this can be verified.

Water above naturally flows downward to moisten; fire below naturally flames upward—this is the natural principle of water and fire’s ascent and descent in heaven and earth. When refining the pill within the body, the method is the same. Thus it is said: *within the body, this can be verified.*

This is *xing* and *ming*, not spirit and qi.

The lead of the water region is but one flavor.

*Xing* is spirit; *ming* is qi. The fusion of *xing* and *ming* is the primordial body; the transformation of spirit and qi is the function of the postnatal state. Thus it is said: *this is xing and ming, not spirit and qi.*

The cultivator who seeks the awakening of *xing* and the firmness of *ming* must, from the very beginning, gather the lead of the water region. The lead of the water region arises when *kun* is broken by *qian* to become *kan*, and within *kan*’s water lies *qian*’s metal. Metal is the mother of water, the mother concealing the child in her womb—a single spark of true yang resides here. When the yang of the *zi* hour stirs within the body, swiftly gather it. As Ziyang said: *"When lead meets the birth of *gui*, hasten to gather it; when gathering, use a lingering intent to guide the fire and drive the metal."* This is what is meant by *"fire drives metal in reverse, naturally congealing the great pill within the crucible."* This single flavor is the root of the great Dao.

Master Yunfang said: *"The gate that gives me life is the door that brings my death—how many are truly awake, how many truly understand? Last night, the iron man pondered deeply: long life and immortality are within man’s grasp."* He points to this single flavor, urging people to seek it here—this is the foundation of elixir refinement.

The *Elixir Canon* states: *"Diligently seek the true lead, the metal within the water of the Flowery Pond."* This is it.

Return to the root cavity, the gate of restored *ming*. Pierce the *weilu*, connect to the *niwan*.

The wondrous work of elixir-making requires clarity on the single mysterious cavity, the proper position of *xing*, and the Way of the ten thousand transformations returning to the root and restoring *ming*—all must revolve through the three barriers.

Thus it is said: the root cavity is the gate of restored *ming*. At the moment of *ming*’s restoration, the spirit soars from the sea of qi, while the fire of focused intent steams and refines—essence transforms into *qi*, stirring the pivot of the crown gate. From the *weilu*, it is gently drawn upward, ascending straight to the *niwan*, where it joins and refines the *qi*, transmuting it into spirit. When the spirit resides in the *niwan* as its true palace, the ten thousand spirits gather in homage. Thus it is said: pierce the *weilu*, connect to the *niwan*.

Master Fire Adept Wang’s *Profound Teachings* states:
*"Through the three barriers of the spine, the crown gate is breached,
Riding the deer, flower in mouth, they move like clouds.
Seizing the flower, riding the deer, treading the clouds away—
Suddenly, the ox-cart appears before them."*

The *Yellow Court Classic* says: *"If you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun."*
The *Returning to the Origin* states: *"Awakening to the Dao, clarity fills the vast expanse;
Leisurely seated, one moves the Celestial Gate."*
The *Dao De Jing* says: *"Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the restoration of *ming*."* This is its meaning.

The true bellows and key, the true crucible and furnace.
Within the nonexistent, there is existence; within existence, there is nonexistence.

The bellows is an empty vessel, a device for pumping. The key is its conduit, its aperture. It speaks of man’s *qi* in constant inhalation and exhalation—*qi* becomes wind, like the bellows’ rhythmic motion. Wind arises from the conduit, and the furnace fire naturally blazes. Over time, heart and breath depend on one another, the cinnabar field ever warm—this is the true bellows and key within our bodies. The *Dao De Jing* says: *"Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows? Empty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it yields."* This is it.

The crucible is *qian*, the nature. The furnace is *kun*, the *ming*. Once the bellows within the body are set in motion, the medicinal substance must be gathered into the crucible. At the moment of gathering the medicine, apply the martial fire’s effort: let the nature govern within, let the *ming* transform without. In an instant, *qian* and *kun* unite, spirit and *qi* merge, coalescing into the returning elixir, forming the sacred embryo. Thus it is called the true crucible and furnace.

Once the returning elixir takes form, nurture it with the gentle fire. Empty the heart to guard the nature, fill the abdomen to nourish the *ming*. Within the dim and distant, the nonexistent gives birth to existence, and existence gives birth to the nonexistent—this is stillness reaching its extreme and returning to movement, movement reaching its extreme and returning to stillness. Thus it is said: within the nonexistent, there is existence; within existence, there is nonexistent.

Entrust the matchmaker, the Yellow Dame; woo the Maiden.
Gently, silently, lift.

The Yellow Dame and the Maiden are but provisional names. The Yellow Dame is *kun* earth, the *wu-ji* soil, also called intent. The Maiden is *dui* metal, the youngest daughter, metal concealed within water. In elixir-making, one must entrust the Yellow Dame as matchmaker to convey the Maiden’s affection—*wu* earth conceals the fire, and fire urges the metal to move. At the first kindling of the fire, the received *qi* is tender; one must carefully turn the pivot of the crown gate, lifting from the tail cavity gently and silently. In a moment, the fire’s power blazes fiercely, the river chariot cannot pause for even an instant—it is drawn into the Southern Palace, then returned to the original position, where the Maiden is wed to the Metal Elder to become the Old Lord.

Master Cui earnestly exhorted, for he saw that people did not grasp the essence of the returning elixir. Thus he employed the metaphor of the Yellow Dame as matchmaker to the Maiden, wishing the world to understand this principle. The *Awakening to Reality* says:
*"The Maiden wanders with her own direction,
Her forward steps short, her backward steps long.
Returning, she enters the Yellow Dame’s abode,
Wed to the Metal Elder to become the Old Lord."*
This is it.

Within a single day, the twelve hours.

Where the intent reaches, all becomes possible. Intent is the function of inherent nature, the true earth. Within a single day’s twelve hours, there lies a year’s seasonal cycles: from the *zi* hour to *chen-si*, six hours belong to yang; from *wu* to *xu-hai*, six hours belong to yin. The return of the first yang is the *zi* hour within the body; the birth of the first yin is the *wu* hour within the body. Now, water and fire lie between south and north, wood and metal stand apart in east and west—how can these four images unite? Only through intent can their messages flow. Thus, in a single moment, the transformations of heaven and earth may be seized. Within the twelve hours of a day, neither day nor night exists; the mind abides here without cease, ever wakeful. Stir the thought to move the fire, still the thought to nurture it. This is why, where the intent reaches, all becomes possible.

Drink the *daogui*, perceive heaven’s artifice. Discern the new and full moons, know dusk and dawn. To "drink" is to feast; the "knife" is metal within water; the "*gui*" is the true earth of *wu-ji*. When refining the elixir and gathering the medicine, one must draw forth the metal within water. Metal cannot ascend on its own—it must rely on the fire of *wu* earth to drive it upward, crossing the Muddy Pellet. There, metal transforms into true liquid, like nectar or sweet dew, a single drop falling into the Yellow Court, savored and relished, its fluids sweet and rich. Hence it is called "drinking the *daogui*."

To "perceive" is to observe. By witnessing the workings of heaven’s Dao, one may grasp its movements and turn the mechanism of the Dipper’s handle within the body, seizing the transformations of heaven and earth in an instant. Thus it is called "perceiving heaven’s artifice." As the *Classic of the Unseen Correspondence* says: *"Observe the Dao of heaven, grasp the workings of heaven"*—this is its essence. The poem of Pure Yang states:
*"Wielding the Northern Dipper with cunning heart,
Inverting the Southern Asterisms with bold spirit."*
This is it.

To "discern the new and full moons": in a year, the winter solstice is the new moon, the summer solstice the full moon; in a month, the first day is the new moon, the fifteenth the full moon; in a day, the *zi* hour is the new moon, the *wu* hour the full moon; in an hour, the first quarter is the new moon, the fourth quarter the full moon; in the sixty-four hexagrams, the *Fu* hexagram is the new moon, the *Gou* hexagram the full moon. Within the body, the tail cavity is the new moon, the Muddy Pellet the full moon; the *Zi* Palace’s advance of fire is the new moon, the *Wu* position’s retreat of the tally is the full moon.

Having grasped this principle, one must also know dusk and dawn. Dusk is evening; dawn is morning. In the hexagrams, there is the principle of morning *Zhun* and evening *Meng*: a single hexagram of six lines, inverted, becomes two hexagrams. Morning *Zhun* brings the birth of one yang below; evening *Meng* brings the birth of one yin above. One yang, one yin; one advance, one retreat—such is the body’s transformation, in harmony with heaven and earth. Whoever comprehends this may attain longevity and lasting vision, riding alongside Zhong and Lü, speaking as their equal. What doubt remains?

Know the floating and sinking, distinguish host and guest.

To achieve union, let there be no separation.

The floating is mercury; the sinking is lead. When mercury of *Li* resides above, it is called floating; when lead of *Kan* resides below, it is called sinking. The secret of refining the elixir lies in raising what sinks and descending what floats. Thus it is said: "Know the floating and sinking."

Having known the floating and sinking, one must distinguish host and guest. The host is life-destiny; the guest is nature. With a body comes life-destiny; with life-destiny comes nature. Nature stands by life-destiny, and life-destiny follows nature. Thus life-destiny is the mother of nature and serves as host, while nature is the child of life-destiny and serves as guest. In daily practice, one borrows the body for use—what the immortal masters call "letting it be the host while I am the guest."

Having distinguished host and guest, lead and mercury share the same crucible, host and guest dwell in the same chamber. Abide in continuous presence, and within the twelve double-hours, turn the light around to reflect inward, forging all into one. The Dao fills the great void.

When the time arrives and qi transforms, the mechanism stirs and the flute sounds: fire arises from below the navel, water is born within the crown. Its wonder arises naturally, without expectation.

Confucius said: "The Dao is that from which one cannot depart even for an instant; what can be departed from is not the Dao." Master Cheng likewise said: "The constant mind must reside within the cavity."

Master Xu Jing said:
*"When spirit once departs, swiftly draw it back;
When spirit returns to the body, qi naturally follows.
Thus morning and evening, day after day,
The sacred embryo is naturally conceived."*

This is why one must achieve union without separation.

When gathering the medicine, regulate the firing process. Receiving qi brings fortune; negligence invites misfortune.

The time for gathering the medicine is when the solitary yang returns within the body. At this moment, one must close the passes and perform the firing practice. Its subtlety lies in harmonious regulation, circulating through the Three Passes, accomplishing three periods in one movement, cycling through and returning to the origin, where the myriad qi congeal into the true.

At this time, one alone receives the joyous expansion of one’s spirit, a delight beyond words. Thus it is said: "Receiving qi brings fortune."

Between firing and withdrawing the tally, one must maintain sincere focus without interruption. Should even the slightest error occur, misfortune will follow.

Guard the esoteric intent with utmost care, for this is the wild battle to avert peril. Thus it is said: "negligence invites misfortune." As the *Classic of the Elixir* states: "Where tiger and dragon unite in embrace, this moment is like crossing a narrow bridge." Such is the case.

Some may ask: "If nature is quiescent and non-doing, one may sit when inclined to sit, sleep when inclined to sleep—why distinguish between gathering the medicine and regulating the firing?" This reveals ignorance of the workings of creation; such a one is unworthy of discussion.

When the firing process is complete, do not harm the elixir. Heaven and earth manifest numinous power; creation yields marvels. When the crucible brims with golden sprouts and white snow blankets the sky, the infant takes form—thus is the firing process complete. Once the firing is sufficient, one should only bathe and nurture gently. Should one fail to know moderation and recklessly continue the firing, the elixir will be harmed instead.

After the elixir is formed, heaven and earth merge as one, and spirit and qi become spontaneously numinous. The immortal masters speak of "the empty chamber generating brightness, the spirit illuminating itself"—thus it is said that heaven and earth manifest numinous power. At this time, one must treasure and cherish it, regulating the breath to utmost subtlety. In quiescent stability, neither inner nor outer, form forgotten and things forgotten, the heart merges with the Great Void, and a single qi of pure yang—thus creation yields marvels.

At the initial formation of the embryo, observe the life-root. At the final shedding of the embryo, observe the four cardinal directions. The primordial origin of kalpas resides within the primordial chaos, the very place where the embryo is formed. At the outset, refine essence to transform it into qi, refine qi to transform it into spirit, refine spirit to transform it into emptiness, refine emptiness to merge with the Dao, and thus form the sacred embryo.

When the embryo first forms, one must constantly guard the life-stem. Thus it is said: "At the initial formation of the embryo, observe the life-root." After ten months, the embryo is complete, and the spirit ascends to dwell in the Mud Pill Palace. The spirit is refined to emerge from its shell, awaiting the fulfillment of merit and the completion of the work, when the Celestial Decree descends, the void is shattered, and the perfected one ascends. Mounting crimson clouds and riding a white crane, there is nowhere in the four directions one cannot go. Thus it is said: "At the final shedding of the embryo, observe the four cardinal directions." As the *Hymn of Quiescence* states: "One morning, when merit is complete, none know it—on all sides, night-shining palaces arise." Such is the case.

In secret practice, with each phrase, response follows.
These two lines summarize the preceding eighty, speaking of the Great Dao’s Golden Elixir: advancing fire and withdrawing the tally, seizing the wondrous key of Creation’s transformations. When applied to the body, it is like the echo answering in an empty valley, the burning-mirror drawing fire, or the moon-disc collecting water—spirit and qi interact, how swiftly it is thus!
Thus it is said: *In secret practice, with each phrase, response follows.*
The *Elixir Canon* states: *"Invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, yet when called, it answers."* Such is the case.

**Hanging the Golden Cord**

**First Watch:**
Sit upright at the onset, begin by harmonizing the primordial qi.
In chaos without speech, extinguish thoughts and preserve true intent.
Breath flows ceaselessly, paired and centered in its place.
Turn it slightly—within a millet grain, heaven and earth are concealed.

**Second Watch:**
In purity, the heart must ever guard emptiness.
Silently reverse the light, illuminating being within non-being.
Drive back the host of demons, the golden lion’s roar shakes the earth.
In an instant, the work is complete—then one’s lifespan equals heaven’s.

**Third Watch:**
At the cock’s crow, when winter solstice’s yang first stirs,
Draw from Kan to fill Li, and send it straight to the Mud Pill Palace.
Fire circulates the Celestial Cycle; within the furnace, lead meets mercury.
After nine revolutions, the elixir is formed—white snow flies in the immortal’s grotto.

**Fourth Watch:**
In blissful ease, all affairs are forgotten.

Shattering the void, myriad golden rays interlace.
