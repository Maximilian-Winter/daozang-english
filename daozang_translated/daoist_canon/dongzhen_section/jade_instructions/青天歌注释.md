**Commentary on the *Qīng Tiān Gē* by the Obscure Sage (Hùnrán Zǐ):**

Do not let floating clouds obstruct the Azure Sky,
For the **Dao/Way** is naturally without action.
When clouds arise, they veil the Azure Sky and all phenomena,
Yet all that is *with action* is but an illusion.

The "Azure Sky" refers to **human nature** itself.
The "floating clouds" symbolize the **human’s杂念 (zániàn, miscellaneous thoughts)**.
These two lines serve as a fundamental outline for those who cultivate the **Dao/Way**.

In general, throughout the day and night,
The mind must remain pure and unadulterated,
The intention must be **湛然 (zhànrán, clear and profound)**,
Never stirring a single hair’s worth of private thought—
For if true nature is left undisturbed,
It will naturally shine forth, like the Azure Sky unobstructed by clouds.
Yet if the mind is enslaved by its desires,
And when confronted with sights or sounds,
It drifts along with its thoughts,
Then its deviations grow ever more distant—
This is like the clouds arising and veiling all phenomena.

When all phenomena stand in orderly array and subdue the hundred evils,
Nature is tranquil, emotions at ease.
But if the radiant light fails to dispel darkness,
And the mind grows restless, the spirit weary,
Then it is said that **one nature** holds its rightful place,
And the hundred evils naturally retreat—
Thus, the body becomes a realm of **天地 (Tiān-Dì, Heaven and Earth)**,
And **万气 (wàngì, the myriad qi)** merge into **一气 (yīqì, singular qi)**,
As do **万神 (wàngān, the myriad spirits)** into **一神 (yīshén, singular spirit)**.

When the mind is naturally stable and sovereign,
It subdues the hundred evils.
Yet if anger cannot be restrained,
Desire cannot be curbed,
And one indulges in unrestrained emotions,
Then darkness is ensnared—
This is when my radiant light fails to dispel the shadows,
And the evil **魔 (mó, demons)** flourish.

At first, I opened the **廓 (kuò, void)** of Heaven and Earth, pure and clear,
Mastering myself and returning to propriety,
Singing of the peace of ten thousand households and a thousand gates—
The world submits to **仁 (rén, benevolence)**.
This speaks of those who attain the **Dao/Way**,
Piercing through the illusory nature of the birth-body,
Revealing its true emptiness—
Only this pristine stillness remains,
Ever like a babe in arms,
Nature itself is void, yet life is firm—
Then throughout the body, the **四大 (sìdà, Four Great Elements)** and **八万四千毫孔 (bāwàn-sìqiān-háokǒng, eighty-four thousand hair-like pores)**,
The blood and **气 (qi)** flow unimpeded,
And all passages are unobstructed.

The *I Ching* (Book of Changes) states in the *Kūn* (Earth) Hexagram:
*"The yellow center harmonizes with principle,
The upright position fills the body,
Its flow extends to the four limbs,
And beauty resides within."*

Is this not the same as Heaven and Earth being pure,
And all households at peace?

Sometimes a single dark cloud arises,
Anger cannot be restrained, desire cannot be curbed—
Then the nine orifices and hundred bones are all restless,
And **水火 (shuǐhuǒ, water and fire)** fail to balance.

This speaks of when a person’s evil thoughts are stirred—
Like a dark cloud rising.
At such times, one must urgently **知觉 (zhījué, awaken to awareness)**,
Quickly **回光返照 (huíguāng-fǎnzhào, reflect the light inward)**,
And cultivate the **良心 (liángxīn, true/innate mind)**.

If there is no restraint,
And one lets the **眼耳鼻舌 (yǎn-ěr-bí-shé, eyes, ears, nose, and tongue)**—the four gates—
Leak in and be enslaved by form,
Then the **性天 (xìngtiān, innate nature)** is sealed by dark clouds,
And the **苦海 (kǔhǎi, sea of suffering)** churns with waves of **淫欲 (yínyù, licentious desire)**—
Thus, the nine orifices and hundred bones are all restless.

The *Dàodé Jīng* (Classic of the Dao/Way) says:
*"Open its gates,
Balance its affairs,
And it will not fail throughout life."*

The Zen masters say:
*"One need not fear the arising of evil thoughts,
Only fear the tardiness of awareness."*

Mencius also states:
*"To lose one’s chicken and dog and yet know how to seek them is not so bad,
But to lose one’s mind and yet not know how to seek it—ah, this is lamentable!"*

Students of the **Dao/Way** should not neglect this warning.

Thus, the **长教 (Chángjiào, Master of Eternal Teaching)** exhorts:
Let the **慧风 (huìfēng, wind of wisdom)** blow fiercely,
And the **神 (shén, spirit)**—once released—will swiftly return.

The Three Realms and Ten Directions drift and clear away—
Wash the heart, purify the thoughts.

This passage warns the student:
The heart must always dwell within the chest,
In motion or stillness, maintaining purity—
Do not oppose it to the myriad entanglements.

When encountering all forms and phenomena,
One must resolutely sever attachment—
Guard against stirring the mind.

The True Person Yín Xǐ says:
*"When all things come,
I respond with my nature,
Not with my mind."*

The *Vajra Sutra* also states:
*"Do not dwell on form and give rise to mind,
Do not dwell on sound, scent, taste, touch, or dharma and give rise to mind.
Instead, give rise to mind without dwelling—
Thus, the mind is subdued."*

Confucius once said:
*"The gentleman cultivates his station and acts accordingly,
Not desiring what lies beyond it."*

Thus, he teaches:
If the heart’s sovereign can maintain its rectitude,
Wisdom naturally becomes boundless—
Then the Three Treasures return to the body,
The Ten Directions grow serene,
And no obstruction remains.

Clouds disperse, revealing the true form of emptiness—
One True Nature eternally abides.
Naturally, the moon shines in every home.
The entire body is the Dao/Way.

This follows the earlier teaching:
Having attained clarity across the Three Realms and Ten Directions,
With no thought arising,
The true nature eternally remains—
Its wonder manifests throughout the body,
Stars and moon radiate light—
This is the Dao/Way of inner vision and forgetting.

As the *Sutra on Delivering Beings* says:
*"All celestial orders return to their proper places."*
Just as Yán Zǐ’s repeated emptiness demonstrates.

Beneath the moon’s light, now take your flute and blow—
At the hour of *guǐ*’s birth, act swiftly to gather.

A single resonant note shakes both Hua and Yi.
The returning wind blends as one.

**Hereafter, the alchemy of cultivating life begins.**
The moon below refers to the body’s Winter Solstice,
When the hour of *zi* stirs—one *yang*’s first motion,
The moment *guǐ* is born.
At this time, act swiftly to harvest it—
Call forth the spirit to draw the *qi*,
Let the *qi* return to its orifices,
Internally sound its tone, externally seal its gate,
Harmonizing the *lǜ* and blending the hundred spirits.
This is blowing the flute of your body’s unpierced pipe,
Emitting a resonant note that vibrates Hua and Yi.
Without a true master, the oral instruction remains unknown.

Awaken the Jade Boy of the East—
Descend to the Water Palace to seek the Mysterious.
Ride the white deer backward, swift as stars.

**Take from the Abyss to fill the Fire.**
Awaken—this is fumigation, rising from below.
The East refers to *jiǎ* wood generating fire in the *yín* position.
The Jade Boy is the flowing intention, the flying spirit.
Backward riding is inversion.
The white deer is refined essence transformed into white *fèi*.
In summary, whenever entering the chamber to forge the elixir,
Let the sovereign nature flow internally, sink downward to the Water Palace for steaming,
Preserve the middle root, await the gradual intensification of *yang* fire,
Then move and ascend through the head’s pass—
From *yín* to *jǐ*, flowing *wù* earth,
Advancing *yang* fire along the *dū* meridian,
Driving the metal essence upward,
Piercing the Three Passes, ascending to the Southern Palace,
Supplementing the *yīn* within the Fire—
Thus completing the *qián* symbol—
Swift as stars in flight.

**Dally not, but turn with ease—**
Exit has form, entry has none.
Not the *shēng*, nor the *jué*.

The Formless Form.

Dallying is to block the gradual—
From above descending below.
The ease of turning is this:
When the Six Yang converge with *Qián*,
The principle that *yang* has no ultimate end—
One *yín* arises beneath the Five Yang,
And from here onward, one must block the gradual.

From *wǔ* to *hài*,
Using *jǐ* earth to retreat the *yín* symbol,
Descending through the *jīn* gate, crossing the Magpie Bridge at *Huá Chí*,
Broad and unrestrained,
Entering the layered towers of the Crimson Palace,
Straightforward to the *Kūn* Palace’s earthen cauldron—
And there it halts.

A pearl is born, round as the moon—
Not the *shēng*, nor the *jué*.

The three-foot *yún* bow with twelve strings,
The three flowers gathered in the tripod.
Through the ages, the *Hùnyuán* chisel.
The Five *qi* pay homage to the Primordial.

This continues the thought of *bié zhuǎn yī bān lè*—
Thus the three-foot *yún* bow:
The three great elixirs return to the tripod,
Mystically merging to condense the True,
Each breath reclaiming a year’s twelve months of transformation.
As the *Dān Jīng* says:
*"Cluster years to return to months,
Cluster months to return to days,
Cluster days to return to hours—
Within one hour, only two *hòu* are used,
Running the *Zhòutian* cycle with the *fǔ* fire,
Harvesting the elixir to enter the chamber,
To perform the inner work,
Fusing and tempering to form the Sacred Embryo—
Thus is the *Hùnyuán* chisel through the ages."*

The *Dù Rén Jīng* states:
*"Central harmony of the Five *qi*,
Mingling with the hundred spirits,
Ten revolutions return the soul,
Ten thousand *qi* become immortals."*

Thus the *Liáo Zhēn Zǐ* says:
*"The great elixir’s threefold essence, *qi*, and spirit—
Heaven’s child and parent mutually embrace.
The wind returns, mingling to restore the True Body,
Daily refining—ever anew."*

The jade resonance, clear and resonant, surpasses *Zhèng* music.
The heavens are free of floating veils.
Light and pure, it permeates the enlightened heart.
The Four *qì* are bright and clear.

This continues the meaning of the *Hùnyuán* chisel—
Thus the jade resonance, clear and resonant:
The true fire’s refining work is achieved,
Stripped of old defilements,
Attaining harmony of spirit and *qi*,
Like *Shùn Shāo*’s pure harmony,
Cutting off the licentious *Zhèng* sounds,
Awakening to jade within my body—
No other hue remains,
Naturally permeating, reaching the heart.

The *Dù Rén Jīng* says:
*"The golden true resounds, flowing through the cloudy encampment,
The jade sound gathers *qi*, the spirit wind gathers mist—
This is only for those with true transmission and practiced work.
How could they know such marvels?"*

From one attainment, ghosts and spirits assist,
No demon dares to interfere.
Ascending earth, transcending heaven beyond ancient and modern.
Transformation follows me.

This speaks of the Dao’s perfection—
Change and transformation at will,
The universe within me, all transformations in my body.
At this station, *yín* and *yang* follow my command,
The Five Phases are my tools,
Wind and rain are my summons,
Thunder and lightning are my calls.
Thus manifesting the Great Body,
Permeating every dust mote,
Hiding the Small Body,
Bearing *Móu Mí*.

Ghosts and spirits cannot fathom my scheme,
Naturally bound to guard me—
Entering earth, ascending heaven,
Transcending past and future, all within me,
Limitless transformation.

Unbounded freedom, no constraints,
Not enslaved by form.
The heart does not covet honor, the body knows no shame.
Inner and outer both forgotten.

This continues the thought of transcending past and future—
Thus unbounded freedom:
The Dao alone is my body,
Not swayed by the world’s changes,
Inverted and wielded with ease,
Transformation follows me—
How could there be constraints?
Wealth, honor, and glory—
At this point, all are overturned.
Would my heart still covet honor, my body know shame?

This path of life—
If not a resolute man of decisive courage,
How could one attain this?

Leisurely singing the *White Snow* song from the *hú*,
The Dao is the Great Void.
Quietly tuning the *Yang Chun* melody of the world beyond,
Transcending the Three Realms.

This speaks of leisurely singing—
Self-attained true joy.
My body has another *hú* heaven’s scenery,
Ever flying white snow across the sky,
Clear and bright, not a speck of dust to enter.
As *Zhuāngzǐ* says:
*"The empty chamber births white, the spirit naturally arrives."*
The *Yín Zhēn Rén* also says:
*"In one breath, emotions dissolve—
And one ascends to the Great Dao."*

Thus the Nine Harmonies and Ten Unifications,
One breath of pure *yang*—
Transcending beyond the Three Realms.
Is this not singing the *Yang Chun* melody?

My family’s melody is all natural,
Form and spirit both wondrous.
The flute has no holes, the zither no strings.
Uniting with the True Dao.

This speaks of the nine-turn elixir’s perfection,
Detaching the body, transforming the spirit—
The natural Dao, the body akin to emptiness,
Not a form to be seen.
Thus the *Yuānshǐ Tiānzūn* says:
*"Seeing me is not seeing,
Hearing me is not hearing,
Abandoning all boundaries—
This is called the Marvelous Dao."*
How could the flute truly have holes or the zither strings?

These messages can only be silently understood by the ancients—
The Dao is formless,
I am not-I,
Iron walls, silver mountains—
Suddenly pierced through.

When the student here grasps a word,
All study is complete—
What doubts remain?

Awakening in surprise to the dream of mortal life,
The void dissolved into dust.
Day and night, pure sounds fill the Celestial Cavern—
Only the golden true reveals itself.

This passage summarizes the marvel of the beginning and end—
The attained—
Attaining the true Dao,
Forever certifying the indestructible golden body,
Awakening to the illusory nature of all conditioned existence,
Like a dream.
Thus today, ascending to the supreme marvelous Dao,
Within my body, night and day, the music of immortals resounds,
Filling the Celestial Cavern.

This also warns later scholars:
Though one may attain worldly fame or surpassing literature,
Without the true transmission of the Dao,
In the end, it is all empty and unreal.
If one only clings in delusion, lost in mortal dreams,
Endless cycles of rebirth—
How could one escape birth and death?

Only a resolute man of decisive courage
Can truly believe, penetrate, and sever.
One awakening glance—
Directly transcending the formless realm,
Turning toward the Great Dao,
Internally nurturing spirit and *qi*,
Externally blending with the mundane and dust.

This is the Dao/Way of both dwelling in and transcending the world,
Instantly riding alongside the immortals and Buddhas—
How could this be mere empty talk?

The *Celestial Cavern*’s song of commentary is now complete.
