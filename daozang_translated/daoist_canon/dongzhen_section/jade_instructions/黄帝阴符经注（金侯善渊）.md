**Preface to the Commentary on the *Huangdi Yin Fu Jing***
The Dao/Way is boundless, the more one pursues it, the more distant it grows;
The utmost truth cannot be confined, the more one measures it, the deeper it becomes.
The mysteries of the profound abound—who can hope to grasp them?
It is the *Huangdi Yin Fu Jing* that does so.
*Yin* refers to the inner cultivation of the subtle, hidden nature;
*Fu* refers to the outer alignment with the pure, unified truth.

The utmost truth transcends and harmonizes with the three essentials (*San Yao*), its essence permeating the nine orifices (*Jiu Qiao*) to subdue their disorders.
Thus, the principle of life and death lies in the eyes.
It is not for the deaf and blind, so they may perceive the Dao/Way of Heaven—
therefrom emerges the divine illumination, hence called *executing Heaven’s course*.
The meaning of this text is that the sacred function must be fully realized here.

**Commentary on the *Huangdi Yin Fu Jing***
*Yin Fu* is the cultivation of a nature unified with the pure Dao/Way.
Daoist Hou Shan Yuan of the Maoshu Mountains, surnamed Tai Xuan, offers this commentary.

*Perceiving the Dao/Way of Heaven*—
this refers to the divine transformations adapting to the clear, luminous *qi* of the heavens.
*Executing Heaven’s course* is thus complete.
When one’s *virtue/power* (*De*) aligns with Heaven’s, its mechanism is fully realized here.

Heaven has five *thieves* (*Wu Ze*), those who see them prosper.
When the five phases (*Wu Xing*) are out of order, they will steal one’s fate;
When the five spirits (*Wu Shen*) are misaligned, those who encounter them will prosper on their own.
The five thieves lie within the heart, manifesting in Heaven’s operations.
Heaven’s five thieves originate in the heart;
The heart connects with the five spirits, acting upon Heaven.

The universe lies within the grasp of the hands,
The *Ling Shū* (Spirit Pivot) governs transformations—
like wielding the mechanism of Heaven and Earth.
All ten thousand transformations arise from the body.
The ten thousand spirits (*Wàn Shén*) harmonize with transformations;
The body embodies the Dao/Way.

Heaven’s nature is humanity (*Rén*).
Humanity’s heart is the mechanism.
Humanity’s heart aligns with Heaven’s nature in *virtue/power* (*De*), hence it is the mechanism of the heart.

Establish Heaven’s Dao/Way to regulate humanity.
Heaven’s Dao/Way is non-action (*Wu Wei*), self-sufficient and unchanging;
Humanity’s Dao/Way is interdependent, regulating the heart’s course.

When Heaven unleashes a killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise upon the land.
Dragons and serpents also embody Heaven and Earth’s nature;
Their rising upon the land is the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s mechanisms of life and death.

When humanity unleashes a killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth invert.
Humanity’s acts of slaughter cause Heaven to invert and Earth to reverse—
thus, Heaven and humanity together unleash their mechanisms.
When Heaven and humanity act in unison, all transformations find their foundation.
Humanity’s nature aligns with Heaven’s nature—
good and evil transformations, none fail to determine their roots.
Nature has skill and clumsiness, which can be concealed.
Skillful or clumsy natures all derive from Dao/Way transformations—
none escape their inherent principles.

The disorders of the nine orifices (*Jiu Qiao*):
If the ears are not sharp and the eyes are not clear,
The essence (*Jing*) will be wasted in vain—
how can one attain the truth?

It lies in the three essentials (*San Yao*):
The first is the *Taishi* (Supreme Origin) primal essence;
The second is the *Bian Yu* (Illuminating Brightness) universal harmony;
The third is the *Taiguang* (Congealed Light) focused cultivation.
The governance of these three unities is the essential principle of the utmost Dao/Way.
They can be applied in action and stillness.
In stillness, the great Dao/Way is silent and heartless;
In action, divine responses arise and penetrate the profound mysteries.

Fire arises from wood—
when disaster strikes, it must be overcome.
Wood conceals hidden fire—
when disaster strikes, it will reduce its form to ashes;
When humanity has nature, ignorance (*Wu Ming*) will destroy its truth.

Treachery arises from the state—
when the times shift, it will collapse.
If one’s self-cultivation is not upright, the spirit will scatter and perish.
To know and refine this is to be called a sage.
To know preservation and annihilation,
without losing the truth, is to nourish the primal spirit (*Yuan Shen*) well,
to ascend and merge with the Dao/Way of emptiness—
this is the *virtue/power* (*De*) of the sage.

Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life—
this is the Dao/Way’s principle.
Life comes from Heaven’s life-giving;
Death comes from Heaven’s killing mechanism—
life and death’s mechanisms are the ultimate principles of the Dao/Way.

Heaven and Earth are thieves of all things.
Things steal from Heaven and Earth, following their transformations.
All things are thieves of humanity.
Humanity steals from all things, calculating its survival.
Humanity is the thief of all things.
When things reach their extremes, they invert and steal back from humanity.
The three thieves (*San Ze*) thus find their due,
The three *talents* (*San Cai*) thus find their rest.
Mutual theft in sequence aligns with its nature;
Heaven, Earth, and humanity’s order finds its natural balance.

Hence it is said:
*Eat in accordance with the times*—
Thus, divine responses (*Shén Yòng*) do not lose their rhythm.
*Regulate the hundred bones*—
Stirring the mechanisms, all transformations are mastered.
The hundred joints (*Bai Guān*) find their truth;
When the One True Essence (*Yī Zhēn*) harmonizes transformations,
All ten thousand phenomena find their natural order.

Humanity knows its spirits (*Shén*)
Yet seeks them in external transformations, abandoning the true path.
The spirits, however, do not know
That the primal truth is truly present, yet daily use is unaware.
The means to manifest the spirits is the spirits themselves.
It is not to seek external sainthood, but to return to Heaven’s true nature.

The sun and moon have their numbers—
Their eclipses follow their appointed times, their brilliance in accord with their cycles.
Great and small have their fixed measures.
The utmost divine aligns with the Dao/Way, fixed in its due.
Thus, the sage’s function is born.

The primal spirit (*Yuan Shen*) manifests its transformations,
The utmost Dao/Way is born from it.
Divine illumination emerges from it.
The eyes are free from blemish, the body has an external form beyond itself.

This is the mechanism of the Dao/Way—
Divine illumination manifests its transformations,
Thus stealing the mechanisms of Heaven and Earth.

All under Heaven see it,
The nature of following transformations is clear—
one has entered the midst of the utmost Dao/Way.
Yet none can truly know it.
Daily practice without awakening to its principle.

The noble attains it and remains steadfast in poverty,
The noble awakens to it and naturally adheres to its truth.
The petty attains it and risks their life,
The petty awakens to it but does not focus on its principle—
they abandon truth for fleeting gain,
thus lightly discarding their own life.

The blind excel in listening,
When divine light is obscured, they excel in discerning what is clear.

The deaf excel in vision.
Plugged ears cannot hear—
they excel in discerning what is bright.

Cutting off one source of profit,
not coveting external wealth,
steadfastly guarding the singular source of the Dao/Way.

Using a teacher tenfold,
guarding the singular without admixture,
the teacher’s merit is tenfold.

Threefold reversals of day and night,
divine illumination mirrors the Emperor,
the utmost Dao/Way is harmonized.
Threefold unity with the Primordial,
day and night never stray from its rectitude.

Using a teacher a thousandfold.
Threefold unity day and night without loss,
the teacher’s merit is a thousandfold.

The mind arises from things,
seeing things shifts its nature—
divine illumination does not dwell in subtlety.
It dies in things,
the mind clings to attachments,
wandering through birth and death.

The mechanism lies in the eyes.
The eyes are the gate and window of the Five Spirits,
opening and closing hold the mechanism of birth and death.

Heaven’s lack of benevolence gives rise to great benevolence.
Heaven bestows favor and love,
not through human kindness—
yet great benevolence arises from things following transformation.

Swift thunder and violent winds
all move sluggishly.
Raging clouds and sudden storms
all move sluggishly—
they bear Heaven and Earth’s great benevolence and are born.

Utmost joy overflows,
utmost stillness brings purity.
Heaven’s benevolence overflows—
things’ nature is joyful and abundant,
stillness returns to the constant Dao/Way,
purity manifests the utmost divine transformation.

Heaven’s utmost privacy becomes utmost publicness.
Heaven’s mysterious virtue is without self,
thus it fulfills its privacy—
nothing is unused within it,
thus it attains utmost publicness.

The making of birds lies in *qi*.
The divine and true ascend in feathered transformation,
bearing Heaven and Earth’s rectified *qi*.

Life is the root of death.
Entering life’s death,
one emerges from death’s life.

Death is the root of life.
Entering death’s life,
one emerges from life’s death.

Benevolence arises from harm.
The Dao bestows virtue,
things’ nature is harmful—
harm brings benevolence,
thus fortune lies hidden in calamity.

Harm arises from benevolence.
Things’ nature follows transformation,
bearing the virtue’s benevolence—
benevolence brings harm,
thus calamity leans on fortune.

The foolish take Heaven and Earth’s patterns and principles as sacred.
*Yong*—use; *wen*—good and beautiful.
If one uses Heaven and Earth’s good and beautiful principles,
*li*—principle, akin to rectitude—
rectitude reaches effortless action,
subtlety penetrates mysterious transformation,
from the mundane to the sage—
this is called utmost truth.

I use the patterns and principles of the times wisely.
The sagely grasp employs the times’ things,
correcting their wisdom—
*zhe*—wisdom, akin to intelligence—
yet even the sage uses the times’ things,
entering their mechanisms,
never fully attaining sainthood.

Others rely on foresight and folly,
I rely on unforeseen sainthood.
Others await sainthood,
I do not await sainthood.

Thus it is said:
To sink in water and enter fire
is to court self-destruction.

The Dao/Way of nature is still,
thus Heaven and Earth’s ten thousand things are born.
Heaven and Earth’s Dao/Way is gradual,
thus yin and yang prevail.

Yin and yang push against each other—
transformation flows in harmony.

Thus the sage knows the Dao/Way of nature cannot be defied,
and acts accordingly.

The Dao/Way of utmost stillness
cannot be measured by calendrical laws.
Yet there are wondrous instruments,
giving rise to myriad phenomena.

The Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems,
divine mechanisms hidden like ghosts.
The arts of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming
are clearly revealed in their symbols.
