**Preface to the Collected Commentaries on the Scripture of Salvation**
Composed by Chen Jingyuan, Perfected Master of the Right Street Daoist Registry and Master of True Stillness

When the vast and luminous void remained undifferentiated, the great Dao was about to transform, and thus the mysterious scripture emerged in the midst of heaven. As the formless and empty began to coalesce, the wondrous darkness congealed within the azure vault. Each character spanned a full *zhang* in breadth, its radiance casting eight-cornered brilliance—resplendent and dazzling, its light effulgent and refulgent.

At that time, the Primordial Beginning descended to Mount Bokeling, where the Five Elders encircled him in cloud-borne seats. He commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to trace intricate patterns, emulating and transcending reality, drafting the hidden scriptures of all heavens and compiling the numinous models of the five directions. These recorded the eras of the Primal Dragon and Han, concealed within the Purple Tenuity Palace of Yuluo, unfolding into thirty-six revered scriptures and dividing into twelve thousand illustrated scrolls. The celestial scripts and cloud-seals of the Eight Assemblies all trace their origin here.

Of old, within the Azure Heaven of the Beginning and the interior of the Jeweled Pearl, the teachings of the Numinous Treasure were expounded, delivering the celestial and human kindred. The Jade Dawn Lord □□ arranged them from beginning to end, secreting them in the Upper Repository, to be transmitted but once every forty thousand kalpas, sworn never to be lightly disclosed to the lower worlds.

Thereupon, the Golden Mother of Tortoise Terrace, moved by the calamities of the Nine Yangs and Hundred Sixes, personally paid homage at the Jade Capital, earnestly entreating their dissemination. Later, the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan inquired of the Dao upon the northern slopes of Mount Emei, bowing to the Perfected Sovereign and receiving the transmission of the sacred instructions. In the state of Wu, Ge Xuan of Juqu sought the Dao in Guiji Prefecture, supplicating the Perfected on Mount Shangyu, where the chariot of the Great Ultimate Messenger descended, bearing the scrolls of the Numinous Treasure scriptures. This was the supreme scripture, the first to be □□.

Thereafter, those who cultivated and recited it spread throughout the world, its hidden rhymes and secret sounds eluding all comprehension. Yan Dong of the Qi was the first to compose a commentary, gazing upward to trace the revolutions of the celestial qi and downward to fathom the depths of Fengdu’s nether springs. He set it forth in written form, its inner and outer meanings resplendent. Had he not profoundly elucidated the subtle and obscure, how could the essential principles have been so clearly expounded? Thus, those who turned toward this teaching could pierce obstructions and open pathways, awakening understanding in accord with their nature.

Later, the Tang Daoist Xue Youqi, who had served in Qingcheng and cultivated perfection on Mount Heng, composed a true exegesis and preface, clarifying the path of practice. Following him, the Palace Attendant of Great Clarity Li Shaowei and the Dharma Master of Western Florescence Cheng Xuanying each compiled commentaries, citing inner teachings to fill lacunae and supplement omissions, ensuring that matters and principles were fully addressed.

From my youth, I, Jingyuan, have revered the Dao, delving into the jade scriptures in my early years. Undeterred by my ignorance and obscurity, I dared to compile and arrange these texts. Now, from the explanations of the four masters, I have excised redundancies, refined the profound meanings, and assembled them into four fascicles. May this spare the reader from excessive confusion.

Composed on the full moon of the mid-autumn month in the fourth year of the Zhiping era, cyclical year *dingwei*.

The Dao abides in quiescent emptiness and formless stillness, where the mind merges with the spirit in silent accord. The scriptures rely upon transcription, transmission, recitation, and chanting to propagate and amplify their teachings. Without quiescence, one cannot merge with the Dao; without recitation, one cannot propagate the scriptures. Though their paths may differ, their essence is uniformly interconnected. When expanded, they reach distant realms; when merged, they return to the same source.

It is through the Dao that scriptures are established, and through scriptures that the Dao is illuminated. The Dao is the fundamental essence of the scriptures, while the scriptures are the manifest functions of the Dao. Essence and function mutually clarify one another, essence and application merging in profound unity. Thus, the true scripture shines forth above the empty vastness, opening the great source within the Purple Ultimate’s hall. The three ranks of true titles distinguish the flying scriptures of all directions; the seven divisions of the myriad scriptures disseminate the luminous traces of cloud-seals.

Thereupon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy sat in the Upper Palace of the Purple Tenuity within the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis. The Three Caverns’ orthodox scriptures were placed before him, the Three Great Supplementary Scriptures behind; the two books of the *Dao and Its Virtue* served as his attendants, and the Hidden Scriptures of Jade Clarity as the master of teachings.

Now, the *Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure* is one of the three divisions of the Middle Cavern, and the *Scripture of Primordial Infinity for the Salvation of Humanity* is one volume within that division. The methods of cultivation encompass many gates; the chapters for recitation place this volume first. Above, it dispels celestial disasters and safeguards the sovereign; below, it wards off poisonous harms and delivers the multitudes; in the middle, it liberates ancestors and enables one’s own attainment of the Dao. Such is its towering and vast model, unmatched throughout the Three Clarities!

The meaning and purport of this scripture are profoundly obscure, its sounds and rhymes deeply hidden. All expound the principles of the Great Brahma, not the common words of mundane instruction. Thus, it is said that only perfected beings who have already attained the Way, who penetrate the mysterious and fathom the subtle, can fully grasp its chapters. Many recite it, but few truly comprehend it.

Now, undeterred by my insignificance, I have presumptuously shouldered a weight of a thousand *jun*, daring to interpret the sagely intent with my humble faculties. If I might but receive instruction from a mysterious master, I would surely hope to be enlightened.

Composed in the cyclical year *jiawu*, month *gengwu*.

**Fascicle One of the Fourfold Commentary on the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Infinity for the Salvation of Humanity**

**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure Scripture of Primordial Infinity for the Salvation of Humanity**

Youqi says: *Tai* (Supreme) is the name of utmost greatness; *Shang* (Upper) is the title of revered eminence. *Dong* (Cavernous) means penetrating and all-pervading; *Xuan* (Mysterious) signifies the subtle and wondrous. *Ling* (Numinous) is sagely transformation; *Bao* (Treasure) is that which is cherished and esteemed. *Wu liang* (Primordial Infinity) denotes that which cannot be measured or numbered; *Du ren* (Salvation of Humanity) means guiding from the mundane to the sagely. This scripture reveals the path to transcendence and ascension as a transcendent, unbound by limits or constraints.

Moreover, *Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure* is the name of its rank and order, while *Scripture of Primordial Infinity for the Salvation of Humanity* is the title of this single fascicle. As its rank is lofty and exalted, it is further called the *Supreme Scripture*...

The subtle and wondrous efficacy of its teachings is why it is called the *Wondrous Scripture*.

○ *Shaowei* states: *Tai Shang* (Supreme) is the ultimate realm of the Dao. *Dong Xuan* (Cavernous Mystery) is the wisdom that penetrates all. The august and primordial *Yuanshi* (Primordial Beginning) is revered among the myriad sovereigns; the vast and boundless *Da Luo* (Great Canopy) lies above the Three Heavens. As it is supremely great with nothing beyond, and utterly lofty beyond measure, it is thus called *Tai Shang* (Supreme) for its all-pervading penetration, and *Dong Xuan* (Cavernous Mystery) for its profound subtlety. Delving into the obscure to seek clarity, drawing forth the deep to attain the distant, it unites the world’s ultimate principles and exhausts the wondrous numbers of the myriad things—hence it is called *Dong Xuan* (Cavernous Mystery). Without fixed form in its transformations, it is called *Ling* (Numinous); revered, cherished, and esteemed, it is called *Bao* (Treasure). The true scriptures flourish in splendor, as the Five Emperors attend in audience; the jade characters radiate their brilliance, serving as the model for all heavens. Thus, the texts were inscribed on golden tablets, annotated, and disseminated. Treasuring the numinous scriptures, it is called *Ling Bao* (Numinous Treasure). The *Yuanshi Tianzun* (Primordial Heavenly Worthy) responds to the kalpas, traversing the Three Realms to expound the Dharma and deliver humanity. Those who attain the Dao and achieve transcendence are as numerous as raindrops or mist—countless through the ages—hence it is called *Wu Liang Du Ren* (Primordial Infinity for the Salvation of Humanity). The celestial scriptures of the Three Caverns, the essential hymns and chants—all such meritorious practices—prioritize deliverance and transcendence, serving as the ladder to true ranks and the root of human cultivation. Thus, it is called the *Supreme Wondrous Scripture*.

○ The Dao states:
○ *Youqi* says: These are the words of the *Tai Shang Yu Chen Gao Sheng Da Dao Jun* (Supreme Jade Dawn High Sage Great Dao Lord). The *Dao Jun* (Dao Lord) is a disciple of the *Yuanshi Tianzun* (Primordial Heavenly Worthy) and the teacher of the *Tai Wei Tian Di Jun* (Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity). Dwelling in the *Shang Qing Shang Yuan Yu Chen Gong* (Upper Clarity’s Upper Prime Jade Dawn Palace), this is the realm of Upper Clarity, the exalted rank of the Grand Clarity. Having received this scripture, he composed its preface, and thus it is placed at the beginning as its opening mark.
○ *Xuanying* says: According to the *Ben Xing Jing* (Scripture of Original Conduct), the *Dao Jun* was a native of *Xi Na Yu Guo* (Western Jade That Realm). His purple dawn radiated fragrance as the descendant of august royalty. Revering and upholding the *Ling Bao Yuanshi* (Numinous Treasure Primordial Beginning), he was enfeoffed as the *Yu Tai Tian Di* (Jade Terrace Heavenly Emperor) of *Yu Yue Na Lin Chang*. Ascending to the rank of High Sage, he governs the *Xuan Du* (Mysterious Capital). The *Yu Jing Da Dong Jing* (Great Cavern Scripture of the Jade Capital) states: The *Shang Qing Gao Sheng Da Dao Jun* (Upper Clarity High Sage Great Dao Lord) is also called the *Yu Chen Jun* (Jade Dawn Lord). He presides over the *Yao Zhu Yu Que Qi Ying Zi Fang* (Seven Radiant Purple Chambers of the Jade Gate of Elixir Pearls), serving the *Xu Huang* (Vacuous Sovereign). The *Xu Huang* is the *Yuanshi Tianzun* (Primordial Heavenly Worthy). Formerly, in the *Shi Qing Tian* (Beginning Azure Heaven), amidst the *Bi Luo* (Azure Empyrean) and the *Kong Ge* (Empty Songs) of the *Da Fu Li Tu* (Great Floating Black Realm), he received the *Wu Liang Du Ren Shang Pin* (Primordial Infinity for the Salvation of Humanity, Supreme Grade).
○ *Youqi* says: *Xi* (formerly) means past. *Shi Qing Tian* (Beginning Azure Heaven) is the *Dong Fang Jiu Qi Qing Tian* (Nine Qi Azure Heaven of the East), located above the *Yuan Luo* (Round Canopy) and beyond the eastern extremity. *Shi* (beginning) is the name of the first among the five directions; *Qing* (azure) is the color of the nine qi of the east. Thus, the true scriptures say: *Dong Fang Jiu Qi Shi Huang Qing Tian* (Nine Qi Beginning Sovereign Azure Heaven of the East). As the heavens are azure and the qi is green, the azure radiance stretches boundlessly—hence it is called *Bi Luo* (Azure Empyrean). The numinous phoenixes and jade trees resound with songs in the void—hence it is called *Kong Ge* (Empty Songs). *Da Fu Li Tu* (Great Floating Black Realm) is the name of a great realm. *Shou* (received) means the *Dao Jun* stated that he formerly, in this heavenly realm, received the scripture of *Du Ren* (Salvation of Humanity) from the *Yuanshi* (Primordial Beginning).
○ *Shaowei* says: *Shi Qing Tian* (Beginning Azure Heaven) is the *Dong Bei Yu Long Tian* (Northeastern Jade Dragon Heaven). In this heaven, azure radiance interweaves, numinous winds play, and purple characters resound in the forests, naturally forming songs. The sovereign of this realm is named *Fu Li Tian Zun* (Floating Black Heavenly Worthy). When descending to the ten directions to convene for the salvation of humanity, he received this scripture. The *Ling Shu* (Numinous Book) states: In the *Dong Ji Da Fu Li Guo* (Great Floating Black Realm of the Eastern Ultimate), the land is entirely of azure jade, perpetually suffused with azure radiance. There are also *Qing Lin* (Azure Forest) trees, whose leaves naturally bear purple script. When the wind blows through the trees, their sounds form resplendent cavernous hymns, ringing clearly through the vastness—hence it is called *Bi Luo Kong Ge* (Azure Empyrean Empty Songs).
○ *Xuanying* says: *Da Fu Li Tu* (Great Floating Black Realm) means *Da* (great) as vast and boundless; *Fu Li* is the name of its sovereign; *Tu* (realm) is the land within the realm. When the *Yuanshi Tianzun* (Primordial Heavenly Worthy) expounded this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions. At the beginning of his ascent to the seat,
○ *Youqi* says: *Yuan* (primordial) means beginning; *Shi* (beginning) means first. The *Yuanshi Tianzun* (Primordial Heavenly Worthy) established the inception of the myriad transformations, serving as the foremost of all Daoist teachings. Dwelling in the *Yu Qing Shang Yuan* (Upper Prime of Jade Clarity), he governs the domain of the *Da Luo Xuan Du* (Great Canopy Mysterious Capital), planting the root of heaven and earth and giving birth to the mother of the myriad things. Before transmitting the scripture and expounding the Dharma, he first summoned the perfected of the ten directions, each circumambulation corresponding to one direction—ten directions, ten circumambulations—not the same as a single circumambulation of the ten directions. After completing the summoning, he then ascended to the seat.
○ *Shaowei* says: The *Yuanshi Tianzun* (Primordial Heavenly Worthy) is the responsive title of the *Xu Huang* (Vacuous Sovereign). Arising from the true to respond, it is called *Zheng Xiu* (Attainment and Cultivation). His wondrous thoughts and profound origins are uniquely his own. Thus, the *Dong Shen Jing* (Cavernous Spirit Scripture) states: The wondrous image is formless; the responsive manifestation has substance. The qi of true essence transforms into his countenance. At that time, he turned the scripture ten times, and the ten directions all came to rest. There was no distance too far to respond—all arrived at the seat. *Yi* (arrival) means to approach. The great divine perfected, the exalted sages, the wondrously practicing immortals, and the innumerable hosts came riding the void.
○ *Shaowei* says: *Yang* means cessation. The perfected sages, divine worthies, and their retinues overflow—thousands of chariots, myriad riders—all the heavens came. Measured by this standard, their numbers are beyond count. Crimson clouds and cinnabar skies, emerald carriages and jade wheels, feathered canopies casting shade, flowing essence and jade radiance—five colors flourishing, illuminating the vastness.
○ *Youqi* says: *Yang* means *yang* (center), an ancient character where *yang* was used for *yang* (center). *Yang* (center) means exhaustion or completion. Thus, *Wu Yang Shu Zhong* (innumerable hosts) refers to contemplating their presence.
○ *Shaowei* says: From *Yuan Shi Dong Xuan* (Primordial Beginning Cavernous Mystery) onward is the scripture itself. Beyond measure, all are shaded by feathered canopies and ride emerald carriages, crimson clouds and cinnabar skies bearing jade wheels. The perfected of heaven assemble without exception; the exalted sages arrive in unison. Flowing essence radiates through the ten directions; jade light shines through the void. *Liu Jing* (flowing essence) refers to the five-colored flowing essence within the jade light.

The jade light is the radiance of the perfected ones’ bodies. The great void lies above the Grand Clarity.

○ *Shaowei* says: Crimson clouds and flying auroras coalesce into robes; green carriages and jade wheels are harnessed to dragons and phoenixes. All are the swift, flickering brilliance of essence-light, resplendent in dazzling hues—the sacred vestments of the Heavenly Worthy. The *Statutes* state: From the Brahma Heaven upward, all robes are naturally formed from the wondrous *qi* of flowing auroras.

○ *Xuanying* says: A carriage’s *yu* is its central compartment. Since they wear flowing auroras as garments and ride in green carriages, with canopies of numinous phoenix feathers and teams of nine-colored dragons and phoenixes, their mutual radiance and reflection create feathered canopies casting shade, their brilliance vast and resplendent. Thus it is said: *flowing essence and jade light*, *carriages and robes magnificent*; thus it is said: *five colors*. When the five colors flourish abundantly, it is called *yubo* (lush and vibrant). Countless chariots and myriad riders arrive floating through the void, filling the vast expanse of the great emptiness, all journeying to Floating Blackness to hear the Dharma—hence it is said: *illuminating the vastness*.

For seven days and seven nights, the sun, moon, stars, constellations, *Xuanji*, and *Yuheng* of all heavens halt their revolutions. Divine winds fall silent, mountains and seas conceal their clouds, the sky is free of drifting veils, and the four *qi* grow luminously clear.

○ *Youqi* says: Whenever the term "all heavens" is used, it refers to the thirty-two heavens. Within each heaven, there are sun and moon, their essence-light originally transformed from the roots of this realm. *Xuanji* and *Yuheng* are the seven stars of the Northern Dipper. The *four qi luminously clear* are the *qi* of the four images: heaven, earth, sun, and moon.

When the true transmit truth and the sagely confer sageliness, the Three Luminaries cease their revolutions to remain in illumination, mountains and seas absorb *qi* and swallow mist, the Wind Earl dares not rustle the branches, and the Cloud Marshal ensures no shadows obscure the light. Thus heaven and earth grow bright and open, sun and moon clear and radiant. For seven days and seven nights, as the Dharma rites near completion—though it is said their wheels halt, how could there be night? This is reckoned by the measure of ordinary time, the span of seven days and seven nights.

○ *Shaowei* says: These three are celestial portents. The *Treatise on Astronomy* states: The seven stars of the Northern Dipper are called *Xuanji* and *Yuheng*. The four stars of the Dipper’s bowl form the *Xuanji*; the three stars of its handle form the *Yuheng*. The celestial palaces of the sun, moon, stars, and constellations arrive in their time to hear the Dharma—this is why their wheels halt.

In one land, the earth, mountains, rivers, and forests are leveled as one, without height or depth, the soil all transformed into azure jade, without any other hues.

○ *Youqi* says: "One land" refers to the great land of Floating Blackness. Its mountains bear soaring forests of jade trees, its rivers hold divine streams and numinous ravines. Yet all is level and even, without height or depth to cause imbalance. Since the earth is entirely azure jade, how could there be any杂色 (mixed colors)? This is the wondrous transformation of divine power at that time, naturally causing the sun and moon to halt their revolutions and the mountains and rivers to level themselves.

○ *Shaowei* says: These two are terrestrial responses. The mountains, rivers, and earthly palaces, the dwelling places of the earth’s spirits, respond to the emptiness and transform into azure jade.

The assembled perfected ones sit in attendance as the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Dao sits in profound stillness upon a five-colored lion in the empty void.

○ *Youqi* says: The lion exists within the empty void, and the profound stillness is seated upon the lion. The lion is the king of beasts, its might subduing all creatures; with a single roar, all demonic forces submit. The Heavenly Worthy’s divine virtue subdues all demons and thus takes the lion’s seat. Once the Heavenly Worthy ascends to expound the scripture, the assembled perfected ones array themselves to listen.

○ *Shaowei* says: This is the Heavenly Worthy’s manifestation of the Dao.

After one recitation of the scripture, the great sages of all heavens simultaneously proclaim its excellence. At that time, the deaf and ailing men and women of the land regain their hearing.

○ *Youqi* says: Upon first hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s numinous voice, which reveals the wondrous principles of the utmost sageliness, they all cry out in praise—no goodness could be greater. Thus, in the great land of Floating Blackness, whether man or woman, all who hear it find the deaf and ailing restored to hearing. This is the verification of the first recitation.

○ *Xuanying* says: At that time, the men and women of the land who heard the Dharma, upon hearing one recitation, awakened in mind and ear—this is called *opening of hearing*. It is also said: the *land* is the body. Hearing the Dharma and awakening is to enter the palace of the heart—this is the *opening of hearing*.

After two recitations, the blind regain their sight.

○ *Youqi* says: First, their ears hear the wondrous meaning; next, their eyes behold the Heavenly Worthy—this is the verification of the second recitation.

○ *Xuanying* says: With two recitations, they gradually recognize the scripture’s words—thus it is said their *eyes grow bright*. If one considers the focus of attention, this is not an ailment of the physical form.

After three recitations, the mute can speak.

○ *Youqi* says: Since their eyes can now behold the sacred countenance, their mouths can also speak the scripture—this is the verification of the third recitation.

○ *Xuanying* says: With three recitations, their minds awaken to understanding, and they can naturally transmit the wondrous Dharma—thus it is said they *can speak*.

After four recitations, the lame, the chronically ill, and those afflicted with long-standing ailments all rise and walk.

○ *Youqi* says: Since their mouths can now speak the scripture, their feet can also walk the Dao—this is the verification of the fourth recitation.

○ *Xuanying* says: Though they could speak after three recitations, they had not yet fully grasped the true principle. By the fourth recitation, they understand how to seek a teacher and inquire into the meaning—thus it is said they *can walk*. *Ji dai* refers to illnesses transmitted through the ages, spreading and affecting others.

After five recitations, those with long-standing chronic illnesses instantly regain their original form.

○ *Youqi* says: Since their feet can now walk the Dao, their entire bodies engage in cultivation—this is the verification of the fifth recitation.

○ *Xuanying* says: With five recitations, awakening resides in the heart, and merit nourishes blessings. This enables those with long-standing chronic illnesses to have them all dispelled, instantly regaining their original form, as if they had never been ill.

After six recitations, white hair turns black again, and fallen teeth regrow.

○ *Youqi* says: Since their entire bodies engage in cultivation, their forms receive the true effects—this is the verification of the sixth recitation.

○ *Xuanying* says: With six recitations, the merit is abundant and blessings profound, enabling white hair to turn black again and fallen teeth to regrow.

After seven recitations, the old regain their youth, and the young grow even stronger.

○ *Youqi* says: First, the head reveals divine efficacy; next, the entire body bathes in sacred grace—this is the verification of the seventh recitation.

○ *Xuanying* says: With seven recitations of the scripture, the old become youthful again, and the young and robust grow even healthier.

After eight recitations, women conceive, and birds and beasts carry young; whether already born or yet unborn, all attain life and completion.

○ *Youqi* says: Those already born revert to youth and shed old age; those yet unborn attain life—this is the verification of the eighth recitation.

○ *Xuanying* says: The merit of seven recitations encompasses the seven consciousnesses and transforms the Three Realms; with eight recitations, the blessings extend to the Four Kinds of Birth, bringing joy to all sentient beings. Those born from the womb do not miscarry, those born from eggs do not perish, and all receive nurturance—hence it is said that all attain life and completion.

After nine recitations, the earth’s treasuries open, and gold and jade reveal their forms.

○ *Youqi* says: Once humans attain the life of their nature, they further perceive the opening of the earth’s treasuries, and the people of the land all obtain the precious weight of gold and jade—this is the verification of the ninth recitation.

○ *Xuanying* says: The previous passage spoke of the transformation extending to the Four Kinds of Birth; here, even the hidden and solitary receive blessings. The earth’s treasuries are opened, revealing the forms of gold and jade; filling the mountains and rivers, people obtain sufficient use—hence it is said that gold and jade reveal their forms.

After ten recitations, withered bones revive and all rise as living people.

○ *Youqi* says: Having obtained the treasures of the secret treasuries, next the foul and decayed are transformed into the wondrous—this is the verification of the tenth recitation.

○ *Xuanying* says: With nine recitations, the Dao permeates the earth; with ten recitations, it ascends to move the various heavens. Thus, the Supreme One’s *Huihai Lingfu* revives the long-dead withered bones, raising them as living people. At this time, in the entire land, whether man or woman, none do not turn their hearts wholeheartedly, all receive protection and deliverance, and all attain longevity.

○ *Youqi* says: At this moment, in the land of *Fuli*, whether man or woman, young or old, all receive the sacred grace and are universally delivered. The living do not die, and the dead revive—hence all attain longevity.

○ *Xuanying* says: *Qing* means "to exhaust." When the Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture, all the men and women of *Fuli* sat beside him, hearing the wondrous Dharma and each listening with their whole hearts—hence it is said that none do not turn their hearts wholeheartedly. The people of the land receive this wondrous Dharma of deliverance—hence it is said that all receive protection and deliverance; having attained the Dao of true completion, it is said that all attain longevity. Among all the heavenly and human beings, illnesses vary in severity, and the methods of cultivating the Dao differ according to the depth of merit. For minor illnesses, fewer recitations bring healing; for severe illnesses, greater merit brings cure. Thus, it is known that reciting the scripture ten times reaches the various heavens, revives the dead, restores the bones, and grants longevity.

○ *Shaowei* says: When dragons and tigers roar, wind and clouds arise; when the sage acts, the Three Realms respond—this is the natural principle, the inevitable sign. Thus, with ten recitations of the scripture, a hundred ailments are instantly cured. If not for the great sagacity of the Primordial Beginning, who could achieve this? Yet the old methods of learning mistakenly hold that illnesses of the mind and wisdom are not illnesses of the physical form—this error is grave indeed.

Some say: According to the *Zhongren Sitianshu*, cutting off all habitual tendencies, all people become spiritually luminous and do not undergo womb birth. Now, the Heavenly Worthy expounds the scripture in the *Biluo*, which is the third heaven of the *Zhongren*. Why then do the illnesses of the people of this land resemble those of ordinary mortals in the world below? This view is not adopted here. By the power of authority, what is called "a land" refers to a domain—just as feudal lords take their territories as their lands, the Son of Heaven takes the Four Seas as his land, and the Thirty-Two Emperors each take their thirty-two heavens as their lands. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy’s Dao is all-pervading, and his transformation knows no bounds—one may take the Eight Round Worlds as a single land. If this is considered a land, then who is not within the Heavenly Worthy’s land? That men and women have illnesses is nothing strange. The *Kongdong Lingzhang* says: "The wind stirs the Eight Rounds, turning the floating and distant into brightness." The old explanation says: The eight directions and the various heavens are called the Eight Rounds. The *Xuandu* is the Central Palace, and each of the eight directions has five hundred fifty-five thousand five hundred fifty billion layers. Such are the multitude of heavens, the realm of the Primordial Beginning’s singular transformation.

The scripture says: At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture once, and the immeasurable hosts of perfected great spirits from the eastern direction, of boundless and limitless ranks, arrived floating through the void.

○ *Youqi* says: "At that time" refers to the moment when the scripture was first expounded. With the first recitation, the hosts from the eastern direction arrived in full. Since there are distinctions of rank and hierarchy, it is said to be of boundless and limitless ranks. Like fine dust in a crevice, they are innumerable—hence it is said to be a host without end. All ride the void, floating through space to arrive. *Yang* means "center," the meaning of which has already been explained above. This is the moment when, with the first recitation, the deaf regain their hearing.

○ *Xuanying* says: This passage recounts the Heavenly Worthy’s circuit of scripture recitation to summon the ten directions. The earlier text broadly summoned the ten directions but did not specify their locations. This passage repeats the account so that learners may deeply understand that the Heavenly Worthy’s gathering of the various heavens is not without order. Thus, with the first recitation of the scripture, the perfected great spirits of boundless and limitless ranks from the eastern direction, a host without end, arrive floating through the void. *Yang* means "to cease." The minds of the perfected sages are without attachment; they respond when moved. Thus, hearing the scripture once, they arrive floating through the void. The summons is vast and far-reaching—hence it reaches the boundless. The perfected sages are limitless—hence it is said that the hosts all come to witness the Dharma and transmit deliverance to the heavenly and human beings.

After two recitations, the immeasurable hosts of perfected great spirits from the southern direction, of boundless and limitless ranks, arrive floating through the void.

Youxī says: The meanings of the ten directions all correspond to these first two recitations—this is the moment when the blind regain their sight.

After three recitations of the scripture, the immeasurable hosts of perfected great spirits from the western direction, of boundless and limitless ranks, arrive floating through the void.
Youxī says: This is the moment of the first three recitations, when the mute regain their speech.

After four recitations, the immeasurable hosts of perfected great spirits from the northern direction, of boundless and limitless ranks, arrive floating through the void.
Youxī says: This is the moment of the first four recitations, when the lame and the chronically ill all rise and walk.

After five recitations, the immeasurable hosts of perfected great spirits from the northeast, of boundless and limitless ranks, arrive floating through the void.
Youxī says: This is the moment of the first five recitations, when long-standing chronic illnesses are instantly restored to wholeness.

After six recitations, the immeasurable hosts of perfected great spirits from the southeast, of boundless and limitless ranks, arrive floating through the void.
Youxī says: This is the moment of the first six recitations, when white hair turns black again and fallen teeth regrow.

After seven recitations, the immeasurable hosts of perfected great spirits from the southwest, of boundless and limitless ranks, arrive floating through the void.
Youxī says: This is the moment of the first seven recitations, when the old regain their youth and the young grow strong.

After eight recitations, the immeasurable hosts of perfected great spirits from the northwest, of boundless and limitless ranks, arrive floating through the void.
Youxī says: This is the moment of the first eight recitations, when pregnant women, birds, and beasts bearing young—whether already born or yet unborn—all attain perfect birth and completion.

After nine recitations, the immeasurable hosts of perfected great spirits from the upper direction, of boundless and limitless ranks, arrive floating through the void.
Youxī says: This is the moment of the first nine recitations, when the earth’s treasuries open and gold and jade reveal their forms.

After ten recitations, the immeasurable hosts of perfected great spirits from the lower direction, of boundless and limitless ranks, arrive floating through the void.
Youxī says: This is the moment of the first ten recitations, when withered bones revive and all rise as fully formed humans.

Youxī says: After one recitation, one direction is summoned; after ten recitations, all ten directions are complete. Thus, the thirty-two heavens together with the four cardinal directions, above and below, are called the ten directions.

Shaowēi says: This again recounts the cyclical recitation of the scripture to summon the ten directions. Yet the Heavenly Worthy is of utmost divinity, extending and preserving freedom—why does he not summon the ten directions at once with ten recitations? It is to demonstrate solemnity and earnestness, so that people may awaken and understand. When the men and women of a nation wholeheartedly turn in reverence, those who come are like fine rain or dense mist—an immeasurable host filling half the land, causing the earth to tilt and sink, unstoppable.

Youxī says: *Zé* means "to fill and obstruct." Repeatedly describing the people of the nation turning in reverence to the numinous model, their hearts transformed by the true teaching, coming like fine rain flying through the sky, gathering like dense mist enveloping all—so filled and obstructed that the land tilts and sinks. This illustrates their vast numbers. By reason, the land should not tilt and sink; like grass bending before the wind, how could it be resisted? Thus, the sage is without fixed intent, adapting to things as they are.

Shaowēi says: This nation is the great land of Fuli. "Filling half the nation" means the gathering occupies half the land. *Zé* means "to occupy." Then the Primordial Beginning suspends a single treasure pearl, as large as a grain of millet, in the dark mystery of the void, five *zhang* above the earth. The Primordial Beginning leads the perfected great spirits of heaven, the lofty and venerable sages, the perfected of wondrous conduct, and the immeasurable hosts of boundless and limitless perfected great spirits from the ten directions—all enter into the treasure pearl.

Youxī says: The treasure pearl is a metaphor for the Dao/Way. Thus, it is suspended in the dark mystery of the void, corresponding to the meaning of the "mysterious pearl." "As large as a grain of millet" refers to the chief of the five grains, the foundation of human life. It means that those who obtain the scripture are like those who rely on grain for life. Moreover, to receive the transmission of the numinous writ within the treasure pearl is to find treasure within treasure, mystery within mystery, the true within the true, the Dao/Way within the Dao/Way. Thus, the hosts of the ten directions are drawn into the single pearl, further demonstrating the unfathomable transformations of the divine, beyond the reckoning of worldly principles. "Five *zhang* above the earth" means enabling people to transcend the Five Turbidities and escape the workings of the Five Phases. Having transcended the Five Turbidities, one is naturally free from all afflictions; having escaped the workings of the Five Phases, one is forever beyond mutual harm. Thus, when the Five Phases do not harm one another, all things may be preserved whole, naturally attaining long life and enduring vision, realizing the Dao/Way and becoming perfected.

Heavenly and human beings look up and see only a surging multitude entering through the pearl’s opening.
Xuányīng says: *Bóbó* describes the boundless multitude, like rain or mist, entering the pearl’s opening—this also reveals the infinite nature of true wisdom. Once inside the pearl’s opening, their whereabouts are unknown. The people of the nation disperse, and the earth returns to levelness, no longer tilted or sunken.

Youxī says: The "heavenly beings" are the people of the Azure Beginning Heaven; the "people of the nation" are the people of the great land of Fuli. Since they are not the perfected great spirits of heaven, the lofty and venerable sages, they do not enter the pearl’s opening. By analogy, they are also not part of this grand occasion of witnessing and deliverance. Thus, when looking up, they see only the surging multitude entering, entering without obstruction. The pearl is small, yet it does not hinder the multitude. Many and few accommodate one another; small and great contain each other—thus, their whereabouts are unknown. Earlier it was said to be "tilted and sunken," here "tilted and sunken" means uneven. The high places tilt low; initially, half the land was obstructed, appearing tilted and sunken. When the people disperse, it returns to levelness.

Shaowēi says: Former teachings take the pearl as representing the pure, empty, and perfectly spherical essence, and the millet grain as representing the fragrant chief of the hundred grains. Drawing people into the pearl illustrates the all-embracing nature of the wondrous Dao/Way.

Suspended in emptiness, it does not burden the manifold existences. Five *zhang* above the earth, it distances itself from the five desires. The earth returns to levelness, demonstrating the evenness and smoothness of the great Dao/Way; no longer tilted or sunken, it reveals the recovery of true nature. All these interpretations arise from reading against the text, fabricating heterodoxies to shock conventional sensibilities, claiming such things cannot be.

Let us examine this: When the Primordial Beginning first unfolded the charts, the methods and teachings were not uniform—some took non-action and quiescence as their starting point, guiding beings back to their root; others manifested awe-inspiring transformations, compelling people to submit in reverence. Yet the divine powers are free and unconstrained, their true responses boundless. If a pearl can contain heaven and humanity, how could it be impossible?

Moreover, even the minor arts of banished immortals can conceal and reveal within a gourd—how could the august Perfected of the Void be hindered in their movements within a pearl? Within the precious pearl, the Primordial Beginning completed the recitation of the sutra in full.

Xuányīng says: *Jìng* means "to finish" or "to complete." Those who awaken to the Dao/Way have already ascended into the pearl and entered the wondrous. Once the Heavenly Worthy finished reciting the sutra, he transmitted this true scripture to the Most High Lord of the Dao/Way—this refers to the text below. The multitude of Perfected oversaw the deliverance, bestowing it upon me.

Xuányīng says: This clarifies how the Lord of the Dao/Way received the scripture. The "multitude of Perfected" refers to the offices of the Perfected who supervise and deliver beings. After the Primordial Beginning finished reciting the sutra, he commanded these overseeing Perfected to transmit this scripture to the Lord of the Dao/Way. Having received it, the Lord of the Dao/Way says, "bestowed upon me." At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words; the Dharma affairs were roughly complete, and the hosts of heaven returned to their positions.

Xuányīng says: The Lord of the Dao/Way, having received the true scripture, has already attained some awakening and understanding. Since the Dharma affairs were thus comprehended, the heavenly hosts and sages each returned to their original stations, resuming their usual abodes. In an instant, all was silent, without even an echo.

Yōuqī says: "I" refers to the Lord of the Dao/Way himself. After transmitting the treasure within the pearl, the sacred bestowed the true, a thousand Perfected jointly overseeing, ten thousand sages delivering in unison. The celebration of this assembly—how could it be fully expressed? Once the Dharma affairs were complete and the heavenly assembly was about to disperse, in that fleeting moment of joy, all became dark and silent.

Shaowēi says: The sage has no fixed mind; true responses follow conditions. They arise when encountered, cease when the cause departs. At that time, the heavenly and human beings, having encountered the scripture and Dharma, were universally delivered, preserving their original years.

Xuányīng says: Having heard this wondrous scripture, the great assembly was all delivered, safeguarding their full blessings. Thus, they fulfilled their allotted lifespans without premature harm. The land turned in reverence, all cultivating virtuous minds.

Yōuqī says: At that time, the people of heaven and earth—men and women alike—upon hearing the scripture and witnessing the Dharma, all exhausted their sincere hearts to deliver those in calamity, free from the misfortune of untimely death. The three karmas stilled, the six senses unarisen, all evils vanished, and myriad virtues arose together. They did not kill or harm, did not envy or resent, did not lust or steal, did not covet or desire, did not hate or suspect. Their words were free of embellishment, their mouths free of foul speech.

Yōuqī says: "Did not kill or harm" refers to eliminating the sins of bodily karma; "did not envy or resent" refers to eliminating the sins of mental karma; "did not lust or steal" refers to eliminating the sins of bodily karma; "did not covet or desire" refers to eliminating the sins of mental karma; "did not hate or suspect" refers again to eliminating the sins of mental karma. *Huáqǐ* means adorned, false, and frivolous speech; "foul speech" refers to vulgar, abusive, and venomous language. Having entirely abandoned these twelve evil deeds, one then attains great harmony. Equal in compassion and love, even those of different bones become kin.

Xuányīng says: When all people refrain from the ten evils and act in accord with the principle of true constancy, they become equal in compassion and love, and those of different bones become kin. The ancients did not exclusively love their own kin or exclusively cherish their own children. Yao and Shun, in their abdications, could make the world turn to them with sincerity—how much more so when the Heavenly Worthy recites the scripture, and an entire land turns in reverence, naturally making those of different bones become kin. The land is secure, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great peace.

Yōuqī says: When compassion and love are equal, all things are as one. Safeguarding the land and its people in abundance, they delight in the eternal days of great peace.

Shaowēi says: To sever life is called "killing"; to injure and wound is called "harm." To resent others for surpassing oneself is called "envy"; to hate one’s peers is called "resentment." Sexual union without propriety is called "lust"; stealing others’ possessions is called "theft." Insatiability is called "covetousness"; indulgence in cravings is called "desire." Disliking others is called "hatred"; suspicion is called "doubt." Once the ten evils are extinguished, those of different bones become kin; when the myriad practices are mystically united, speech is free of discord. Naturally, epidemics do not arise, people suffer no untimely harm, the harvests are abundant, and the land enjoys great peace.

Xuányīng says: When compassion and love are equal, the land is surely secure. Without premature harm, people are naturally prosperous. The five grains ripen, and disasters do not arise. With these manifold virtuous merits, it is said they rejoice in great peace.

When the scripture first emerged as teaching, the land was guided by the Dao/Way. Those with sincere hearts who revered and honored it were all delivered from the world.

Yōuqī says: Thereupon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, observing the people’s faith and goodness, revealed the true model to guide them. Those who cultivated with utmost sincerity were certain to ascend as immortals and be delivered from the world.

Shaowēi says: This speaks of one region transforming and all regions benefiting, near people submitting and distant people yielding.

The scripture says: What the Primordial Heavenly Worthy recited within the sutra—

Xuányīng says: This refers to the *Hùndòng Chìwén* and the *Yuándòng Yùlì*, which are the *Língbǎo Běnzhāng*.

—are all the inner names and hidden rhymes of the Celestial Emperors of the various heavens.

Yōuqī says: What the scripture refers to are the hidden names of the thirty-two heavens and the inner taboos of the thirty-two Celestial Emperors mentioned in the latter two chapters. All are the words of the great Brahmā, not to be lightly questioned or scrutinized—hence, they are called "hidden rhymes."

These are also the inner taboos of the Demon Kings and the hidden names of the Hundred Spirits—words not of this world’s common speech.

Yōuqī says: The inner taboos of the Demon Kings are the taboo characters of the Five Thearchs and Great Demons. The hidden names of the Hundred Spirits are the titles of Wúyīng and Báiyuán. Since all are hidden names and inner taboos, they are not the common speech of this world.

The perfected immortals among the exalted sages, who have penetrated the mysteries and probed the subtleties, are able to master their texts in full.

Shaowēi says: The *Zìlín* states: *xī* means "thorough and complete."

Yōuqī says: Since these are inner names and hidden rhymes, not the common speech of this world, only among true persons are there those with the talent to penetrate the mysteries and the insight to probe the subtleties, who can thus comprehend their purport. When recited ten times, the various heavens chant in unison from afar, the ten thousand Thearchs offer rites of reverence, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds, sun and moon pause in their course, and the jade celestial pivots cease their turning.

Yōuqī says: This speaks of the exalted sages who have become true persons and penetrated the mysteries and probed the subtleties—when they recite these ten times, their Way resonates with the various heavens, and thus the heavens chant in unison from afar. Their virtue equals that of the ten thousand Thearchs, and so the Thearchs offer rites to welcome them as guests.

Rivers and seas still the flying surges of their waves, mountains and peaks gather in their clouds and mists and raise none. The Three Luminaries halt their radiance, the Seven Brilliant Ones congeal their splendor, heaven and earth stand in steadfast clarity, and day and night shine forth as torches. All demons bind their forms, ghostly spirits extinguish their consciousness, the dead return to life, and white bones become human once more.

Yōuqī says: Since the true Dao proceeds unimpeded, evil demons vanish into concealment, and thus withered bones regain their once-transcended souls, and white bones recover the spirits of their former forms. If one can cause the dead to live again, then surely one can ensure that the living never die—this is the standard of the true person. For those of utmost learning who recite it ten times, the Five Thearchs stand in attendance, the Three Realms bow their heads, demonic spirits lose their sight, ghostly pernicious forces extinguish their consciousness, and those on the verge of death are saved and restored to life.

Yōuqī says: Those of utmost learning are those whose hearts are firmer than iron and stone, whose conduct is more resolute than water and fire, whom heaven and earth cannot surpass, and whom ghosts and spirits cannot delude. They walk paths that others cannot walk, and though they exist, they seem as if absent. Thus, when those whose true names are recorded above the Great Ultimate recite it ten times, the Five Thearchs flank and attend them on left and right, the Three Realms bow their heads in reverence, evil demons lose their eyesight, and those on the verge of death naturally regain life. The Five Thearchs are the celestial Thearchs of the five directions. The Three Realms are the demon kings of the Three Realms.

Shǎowēi says: The great Dao of the exalted sages possesses the majestic power to govern heaven. Those of utmost learning, their strength being slight, can only subdue the earth. Governing heaven enables one to halt the turning of the Three Radiant Ones and restore life to white bones. Subduing the earth enables one to make the Three Realms bow their heads and revive those on the verge of death. The boundaries between great and small cannot be transgressed. The reason for this is that the impure qi of the learned has not yet dissipated, and their bodies have not yet penetrated the true. When summoning and governing the ten directions, their majesty does not yet govern the celestial administration.

Shǎowēi says: The celestial administration refers to the sun, moon, five planets, and the seven celestial bodies of the heavenly patterns. Their virtue can only subdue and govern the earthly deities, binding and restraining demonic spirits, merely averting death but unable to restore life.

Yōuqī says: *Ěr* means "thus." Those of utmost learning, their names and conduct having ascended to the standard of the true, their merit and efficacy surpassing those of ordinary people—yet because their physical forms are not yet true and impure qi still lingers, they cannot yet summon and govern the ten directions, nor can they manifest majesty before the various heavens. They can only subdue and govern evil demons, avert imminent death, but cannot restore form to withered bones and dry skeletons—this is the standard of the utmost scholar.

Shǎowēi says: The learned scholar is the one of utmost learning. Their spiritual power is not vast, their merit not yet complete, so they cannot majestically govern celestial phenomena but can only subdue and govern earthly deities. Their power can avert death at the brink of dying but cannot revive withered bones.

To recite this chapter lightly brings calamity upon oneself.

Shǎowēi says: The Five Thearchs and their majestic spirits attend and guard the *Numinous Treasure*, overseeing those who treat it with irreverence—truly a perilous path. To offer reverent veneration brings prosperity to one’s household, flourishing generation after generation, forming good karmic connections, warding off the ten thousand disasters, and securing the protection of divine spirits.

Yōuqī says: To recite lightly means to do so without proper attire or adherence to ritual protocols, or to recite carelessly while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. Not only does this bring retribution upon oneself, but it also implicates one’s ancestors. If one instead reveres and honors it with utmost respect, it brings prosperity to one’s household, blessings to oneself, flourishing descendants, the eradication of evil roots, and constant association with goodness. Since the thousand spirits come to protect, how could the ten thousand disasters intrude? From this, it is clear that to recite without true understanding is not as good as not reciting at all while maintaining reverence. Those who uphold this scripture should examine this carefully.

This scripture is exalted and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital.

Shǎowēi says: This means that by employing this wondrous Dao alone, one can traverse the Jade Capital. The *Scripture of Original Appearance* states: Above the Great Canopy Heaven is the Jade Capital Mountain, which grows without roots and stands suspended in the void. Within it is the Supreme Palace of the Purple Tenuity, spanning three hundred thousand miles in each direction. Its towers and terraces are adorned with gold and jade, embellished with the radiance of the seven treasures. Above the Jade Chamber are thirty-six precincts, each eight thousand miles in circumference, filled with true writings in large characters. It delivers countless beings and serves as the origin of the ten thousand Daoist paths. Its towering and majestic model is so vast that its virtue is difficult to surpass.

Shǎowēi says: The *Erya* states: *Fàn* means "model."

Yōuqī says: Since it is revered by all heavens and not transmitted to the lower world, it is kept in the secret treasury of the Purple Tenuity and employed uniquely in the Dark Capital. It is the foremost means of delivering beings and the foremost among all Daoist paths. Its towering and sagely model rivals the Kunlun in piercing the clouds; its virtue and capacity are as unfathomable as the vast ocean. This is its wondrous Dao.

The Dao says: Whenever one recites this scripture ten times, all heavens arrive in unison. The suffering souls of the billions of ancestors, from the most distant to the nearest, all receive deliverance and ascend to the Vermilion Palace.

Yōuqī says: This refers to all who recite it, regardless of their rank or standard, as long as they recite it ten times with focused devotion and in accordance with the method. Then the multitude of sagely beings from all heavens descend and gather in the ancestral temple, delivering the suffering souls of ancestors and remote kin. They depart from the Northern Mansion and enter the Southern Palace. The Vermilion Palace is the Southern Palace. After nine years of refinement, they receive transformation and are reborn, becoming noble persons. Those who diligently study this scripture, their merit complete and virtue perfected, all attain transcendence, ascend to the Golden Gates, and roam and feast in the Jade Capital.

Yōuqī says: "Nine years of refinement" refers to the nine-year standard, meaning the number of the three fires—three times three makes nine. The Vermilion Palace is in the south, associated with fire. Refining the form with fire is called the three fires. After nine years of refinement and transformation, they are then reborn as noble persons. Once born, they immediately cultivate this scripture, for the influence of past practice remains. When the merit of ten thousand recitations is complete and the virtue of three thousand deeds is fulfilled, they transcend and ascend directly, attaining transcendence.

Ascending the Golden Gates to pay homage to the Sacred Sovereign, roaming the Jade Capital to audience with the Primordial Beginning—this is the standard of ten recitations.

○ The Lesser Florescence says: This clarifies the deliverance of one’s ancestors.

According to the *Three Primes’ Precepts of Ranks*, the standards for deliverance by the Vermilion Mansion comprise three grades. Nine years mark the middle blessing; great blessing requires but three years, while lesser blessing demands twenty-four. All are reborn in the lower realms as noble persons. By virtue of their former affinities, they cultivate with devotion, escape the cycle of birth and death, and attain transcendence. Those of superior learning who recite this scripture are immediately delivered, ascending to the Southern Palace.

○ Yōuqī says: Those of superior learning are they who, upon hearing the Dao, practice diligently, and upon encountering the Dharma, study without cease. Unyielding through cold and heat, these are they whose names are recorded among the transcendents below the Nine Palaces of Grand Clarity. Having recited this scripture, they attain the Dao in body, ascend to the immortal realms, and undergo refinement in the Southern Palace. When the hun and po ascend as transcendents, the ghostly substance is refined by fire; when the living body attains the Dao, the filth and defilements are refined by fire. All first enter the Southern Palace, then ascend to their proper stations—this is the standard for the superior adept.

For those of the world who recite it, life is prolonged and years extended; afterward, all attain the Way of corpse-liberation. The hun-spirit temporarily perishes, yet they escape the hells, swiftly regain their form, and roam the Great Void.

○ Yōuqī says: The people of the world are those of the common path, not the elect. As their ancestral affinities are shallow and their personal karma slight, they enjoy long life while living, and after death, their forms dissolve temporarily. Yet they are not bound by the regulations of the Three Offices nor suffer the trials of the Nine Bureaus. When the appointed time arrives, their spirits return and their forms are restored. Having transformed their appearance in the halls of the Three Offices and exchanged their youthful countenances for the ninefold-refined corpse, they do not enter the Southern Palace above but traverse the realms of the Great Void. The Great Void lies above the Three Domains of Grand Clarity—this is the standard for the people of the world.

From the perfected to the common, there are five grades, each distinct in rank.

○ The Lesser Florescence says: This further clarifies that even the people of the world, by reciting it, may deliver themselves. Though their virtue is meager and their merit incomplete, they may not ascend with flesh and bone together, yet they attain deliverance through corpse-liberation. The *Scripture of Original Appearances* states: "If prior merit is not established, then afterward, flesh and bone do not ascend as transcendents; thus, they attain the Dao through corpse-liberation."

According to the superior scriptures, corpse-liberation has four kinds:
1. **Martial liberation**, as when Jikang entrusted his execution to the marketplace, or Huainan transformed his form in prison;
2. **Literary liberation**, as when Ciqing exchanged his essence for shoes, or Changfang dissolved his form in bamboo;
3. **Refinement by water and fire**, as when Feng Yi drowned in the great river, or Fengzi was consumed by the fire-tree;
4. **Refinement by Grand Yin**, wherein one appears dead—feet uncyanosed, skin unwrinkled, eyes undimmed—yet limbs remain pliable, and the corpse does not decay for a hundred years before reviving as a full-grown person.

The *True Sayings* records: Master Pei said: "Those who attain corpse-liberation as transcendents may not ride the flowered canopy, mount the flying dragon, ascend the Grand Ultimate, or roam the Nine Palaces—they merely escape death. Liberation by bow and sword is martial; by bamboo staff, literary; together with water, fire, and Grand Yin, these make four kinds of liberation."

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering without end; all celestial and human beings receive its blessings. Boundless merit extends grace to the living and the dead.

○ Yōuqī says: The efficacy of this scripture’s power is vast and profound, difficult to fathom. Ten recitations align the ten thousand qi, and all ascend as transcendents; five grades deliver countless beings. Celestial and human beings bathe in the joy of liberation, while the living and the dead rely on its grace for deliverance.

This treasure of the heavens is not transmitted to the lower world.

○ The Lesser Florescence says: When the Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture, it was not transmitted to the lower world. When the Queen Mother entreated its preservation to avert the calamity of the *jiǎ-shēn* year, it began to circulate, and thus the world first received it.

Master Song says: This scripture delivers beings in four ways:
1. Ascending to heaven in broad daylight, delivered in the body;
2. Delivered through transformation by corpse-liberation;
3. Dying yet not decaying, later reviving;
4. The hun-spirit temporarily perishing, then ascending to the Southern Palace for refinement.

As karma varies in weight, so too do the rewards differ. It delivers even one’s great-grandparents, hence it is said that both the living and the dead receive its grace.

Those of utmost sincerity offer gold and treasures, swearing oaths to the heavens before transmitting it. To leak or profane it lightly brings misfortune upon nine generations, condemning them to long servitude as ghostly officials.

○ Yōuqī says: As it is called a secret of the Mystic Metropolis, it was rightfully not transmitted to the lower world. Now, by the Most High’s dissemination, it has descended to humanity. Thus, those of utmost sincerity offer gold and treasures to pledge their devotion, proclaiming solemn vows. To violate the oath is to invite punishment upon nine generations; to guard its secrecy is to align the merit of a hundred ancestors.

○ The Lesser Florescence says: The sacred text is profound and weighty; its transmission is no trifling matter. How could one lightly disseminate it and bring calamity upon nine generations?

Five Emperors, with twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens each, attend the scripture, safeguarding its divine text and protecting the bodies of those who receive it.

○ Yōuqī says: The Five Emperors’ Jade Lads and Jade Maidens refer to the Jade Lads and Maidens who attend the Five Emperors—not that the Five Emperors and the Jade Lads and Maidens all attend together. The Five Emperors are the Five Elder Sovereigns, not the emperors of the five directions. Together, the lads and maidens number forty-eight. They constantly guard the divine text of the scripture and also protect those who recite it, commending their sincere merit and scrutinizing transgressions of leakage or profanation. Those who receive and recite it must be cautious.

When going out or traveling, one should carry it, so that the text may shield the body, avert disasters, and dispel worries.

The Dao says: In the first month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture to sever the earthly servitude of past lives’ souls and deliver them to the Southern Palace above.

○ Yōuqī says: The first month is the great celebration of the Upper Prime.

Thus, blessings extend to one’s ancestors and forebears of past generations, delivering the suffering souls of the departed from the servitude of ghosts and spirits, and granting them the joy of salvation by the immortal officials. As for the term "fast," it means that the body is free from miscellaneous affairs, the mind is not distracted by external thoughts, both inner and outer are pure and empty, and one embraces the Origin and guards the One throughout this month—hence the term "prolonged fast." In the seventh month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture, and the body shall attain immortality; the names of the adept shall be inscribed in the heavens on yellow registers and white tablets, erasing death and ascending to life.

Yōuqī says: The seventh month is the great celebration of the Middle Prime.

Thus, the Middle Prime extends to one’s own person, and the names ascend to life in the heavens; recorded on white tablets, they are stricken from the registers of Mount Feng and Mount Tai, and inscribed in the black ledgers, the body attains immortality and the rank of a celestial official in the Heavenly Palace. The "yellow registers" and "white tablets" are written in gold on yellow paper and inscribed on white jade slips. Here, the Lower Prime of the tenth month is not mentioned because the Upper Prime extends blessings to ancestors, the Middle Prime to oneself, and the Lower Prime to one’s descendants. Now, since all have been made clear that the foremost task is cultivation, and cultivation above concerns ancestors while below it does not involve descendants, the Lower Prime of the tenth month is thus omitted. The scripture also does not speak of the merits or transgressions of the Lower Prime. Those who pursue cultivation must examine and consider this carefully.

Shaowei says: When the Celestial Officials review the seasons, it is fitting to deliver one’s ancestors; when the Earthly Officials examine the months, it is proper to deliver oneself. This distinction in sequence reflects the order of precedence and hierarchy. The yellow registers and white tablets are the records of immortals. The *Scripture of the Recorded Characters and Extended Years* states: "Names inscribed in the Emperor’s register arise from past karmic affinities, all through diligent devotion—it is not by chance."

Xuanying says: According to the *Three Primes’ Grades and Ranks*, the first month is when the three yang qi arise, corresponding to the time when the Upper Prime’s celestial officials review and determine destinies, making it fitting to deliver one’s ancestors. The seventh month is the Middle Prime’s month of review, the time when the Earthly Officials examine and assess, making it proper to deliver oneself. This, too, reflects the distinction in sequence and the order of precedence and hierarchy. The method of cultivating the Dao universally delivers the boundless, universally saves the living and the dead, and moistens all things, whether moving or still; above, it benefits the imperial ancestral temples, and below, it aids the suffering souls of the Five Pains—how could it be limited to the salvation of the seven generations of ancestors? This is to inspire filial devotion in people, hence it is said to be for the souls of past generations. In the tenth month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture for the sake of emperors, kings, lords, ministers, fathers, and sons, to secure and stabilize the nation’s destiny, preserve the heavens’ enduring existence, ensure unbroken generations of rulers, and maintain eternal sovereignty over their domains, so that the people may call it the Great Peace. On the eight nodal days, recite this scripture to become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces.

Yōuqī says: The eight nodal days refer to the four beginnings (the starts of the seasons), the two equinoxes, and the two solstices.

These are all days of grand celestial celebrations and auspicious gatherings, when the merits and transgressions of cultivators are reviewed. If one can fast and recite on these days, one shall become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces. The reason for this is that the Nine Palaces, excluding the central honored position, encircle the eight palaces corresponding to the eight nodal days. Since they align with these days, recitation allows one to ascend to this realm.

Shaowei says: One Prime has three palaces, and three Primes have nine palaces. Another explanation: On the eight nodal days, eight scribe-spirits descend to observe people’s good and evil deeds, which is why one must cultivate and recite on these days. Why does recitation on the eight nodal days make one a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces? It is because the eight nodal days correspond to the eight trigrams, and when the three on the left and the seven on the right are combined, adding the central palace makes nine palaces—hence the name Perfected One of the Nine Palaces. On one’s natal day, recite this scripture to purify and rectify the soul and spirit, ensuring the eternal preservation of the myriad qi, sparing one from suffering and affliction, and bestowing a radiant light upon the body.

Yōuqī says: The natal day is the day of one’s year and cyclical sign, when only the merits and transgressions of the individual are reviewed—hence the need to fast and recite on this day. Moreover, for a person, qi is the root and spirit is the foundation. When qi is preserved, the spirit is rectified; when the foundation is firm, the root runs deep. When inner spirit and qi harmonize, external radiance naturally manifests. Thus, myriad worries do not arise, and suffering and affliction cannot enter. Since one cultivates and recites on one’s natal day, one can preserve one’s own spirit and qi. The sages established these principles for a reason, and by extension, the principles of cultivating the real become self-evident.

Shaowei says: When the spirit is harmonious, qi flows smoothly; thus, hearing the numinous sounds, one’s spirit becomes pure and clear, and perceiving emptiness and whiteness, one’s radiance shines forth.

The Commentary says: On the natal day, the Lord of Life descends to examine people’s good and evil deeds, which is why one must cultivate this scripture. If one does evil, perverse qi enters the body; if one does good, upright qi returns to oneself, ensuring eternal preservation and sparing one from suffering and affliction. The Three Realms provide guardianship, the Five Emperors oversee reception, the myriad spirits pay homage, and one’s name is inscribed in the heavens. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, one ascends in broad daylight to the Upper Clarity.

Yōuqī says: The guardianship of the Three Realms refers to the attendants of the demon kings of the Three Realms. The Five Emperors’ oversight of reception refers to the Five Celestial Emperors’ welcoming and sending off. Thus, when one sits in audience with the host of spirits, one’s name is inscribed in the Emperor’s register. When the merit of ten thousand recitations is fulfilled and the thousand practices of virtue are perfected, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight and flies to the Upper Clarity.

Shaowei says: Master Lu states: The Upper Clarity is the Central Capital. According to the *Scripture of the Dragon’s Ascent*: Above the Four Brahma Heavens lie the Three Clarities. The Great Clarity has twelve heavens, where the Nine Immortals dwell; next is the Upper Clarity with twelve heavens, where the Nine Perfected reside; and the Jade Clarity has twelve heavens, where the Nine Sages reside. These thirty-six heavens are all indestructible realms. The *Scripture of the Cavernous Spirit* states: The Three Clarity Heavens are naturally transformed, standing in the void, with palaces of the seven treasures, neither arising nor perishing, and attended by a hundred spirits.

The Dao says: On the days of practicing the Dao, one should bathe with fragrant water, fast, enter the chamber, and face east.

Yōuqī says: The days of practicing the Dao are the days of reciting this scripture.

Fearing that one may fail to maintain this practice over time, it is thus said: "the days of practicing the Dao" are precisely the auspicious days mentioned earlier. Each time, one should bathe with fragrant water, then enter a separate chamber to purify the heart and cleanse the self, abiding in clarity and non-action. For those dwelling in the mountains with limited means, one may also use one’s own sleeping chamber, keeping it always tidy and clean. First, don fresh garments, rinse the mouth, and place the scripture upon the reading stand. Then, in the scripture hall, light incense, bow in reverence, kneel, and make one’s entreaty.

The purpose of recitation and cultivation is to take the scripture into the chamber, sit upright facing east, light incense, and unfold the text. Focus the mind and let the eyes follow the words, chanting softly. If one merely recites hastily, errors in the text will abound; in such cases, one should return to the previous thirty characters and read them again, avoiding haste. To rush through the repetitions for the sake of quantity is to squander merit and risk grave harm. Modulate the voice in recitation, harmonizing the spirits and invigorating the soul, ensuring that the fragrant qi lingers unbroken in the chamber.

Upon reaching this passage, perform the prescribed visualization and knock the teeth thirty-two times, corresponding to the thirty-two heavens. Bow thirty-two times in the heart. Shaowei says: *The True Sayings* state: "Knock the teeth to gather the spirits; swallow the saliva to harmonize the true." The *Book of Changes* says: "The Supreme emerges from Zhen." Zhen is the direction of long life, the honored quarter of all heavens—hence facing east.

First, visualize the Heaven of Huangcen and bow to it; then proceed to each Heavenly Emperor in turn, bowing once for each. Close the eyes and meditate, envisioning the body seated amidst clouds of three colors: azure, yellow, and white. Shaowei says: "Mysterious qi is azure; primordial qi is yellow; original qi is white." Visualize these three qi. Within and without, all is dim and profound, with the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, lions, and white cranes arrayed to left and right, while sun and moon illuminate the chamber. The room shines resplendently, a radiant orb rising from the crown, its light pervading the ten directions—all must be vividly imagined.

The secret incantation says: Youxi says: Light incense again and half-open the eyes. Place the hands together upon the knees, then knock the teeth thirty-two times, each knock resonating with one heaven. When finished, visualize oneself rising to bow to the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors, beginning from the east and proceeding counterclockwise through the four directions, bowing once to each. After completing the bows, close the eyes and visualize oneself seated, naturally enveloped in clouds of azure, yellow, and white, filling the chamber in dense, billowing profusion. To the left is the Azure Dragon, to the right the White Tiger; before is the Vermilion Bird, behind the Black Tortoise. Lions stand in two rows on either side, eight in each, facing one another. White cranes accompany the lions. The sun is before, the moon behind, their light illuminating the chamber. A radiant orb rises from the crown, its brilliance penetrating the ten directions. After completing this visualization, review it once more, ensuring all is as clear as if seen with the eyes.

The secret incantation is spoken with the mouth moving but without sound. The Supreme Mysterious Primordial Most High Dao Lord summons forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officials, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Jade Lads who tend the incense, the Jade Maidens who transmit words, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, and the Incense Officials of the Day—thirty-two of each—opening and declaring the following: "Today is an auspicious and joyous occasion, a day of prolonged purification and clarity in the hall, of cultivating and reciting the scripture to deliver boundless beings. May what I and those born under the cyclical signs of *jia* and *yi* now declare ascend directly to the august presence of the Most High Thirty-Two Heavens’ Primordial Thearch, the Supreme Honor."

Shaowei notes: The Primordial Thearch is another title for the Heavenly Venerable.

This done, draw in *qi* thirty-two times.

Shaowei notes: "Drawing *qi*" means inhaling it through the mouth, not expelling it.

Then visualize the *qi* of each of the Thirty-Two Heavens in its respective color, inhaling them in sequence, beginning with the Heaven of Imperial Might.

Face east to recite the scripture.

Youxi observes: Once the furnace invocation is uttered, there is no need for exhaustive detail; only the essentials are stated here. The Incense Officials of the Day are one for each of the Thirty-Two Heavens. They descend to oversee and later ascend to report. "Today is an auspicious occasion" refers to the propitious days of the Three Primes and Eight Festivals. Each time it is said, "Today, such-and-such a day, is auspicious," and since prolonged purification is repeatedly mentioned, one must indeed fast. "I and those born under *jia* and *yi*" later encompasses the sun, moon, heaven, earth, stars, the sovereign, and all living beings. In ordinary times, it refers to oneself and one’s ancestors. The Primordial Thearch is not the same as the Primordial Heavenly Venerable. The Thearch is exalted and ranks equal to the Primordial, hence the title is fitting. Thus, the name "Primordial" is not exclusive to one honorable being.

After the invocation, inhale the three-colored clouds of *qi* through the nose, draw them into the mouth, and swallow. After thirty-two repetitions, the entire body becomes thoroughly permeated. After a long while, recite the scripture.

Offer incense and recite the scripture. For the first recitation, begin from the preface and proceed with visualization; in subsequent recitations, start directly from the title *Primordial Penetrating Mystery*. Each visualization should be repeated ten times for optimal effect. If urgent matters arise, one may briefly rise; if the interval is somewhat prolonged, one must return to the beginning, resume from the preface, and renew the visualization.

Shaowei notes: The text from *Primordial Penetrating Mystery* onward is the scripture proper.

*Primordial Boundless Deliverance of Beings, Supreme Wondrous Scripture: Annotated Edition, Scroll the First* concludes.
*Primordial Boundless Deliverance of Beings, Supreme Wondrous Scripture: Annotated Edition, Scroll the Second* begins.

Annotations by Qi Yan of the Northern Qi, Tang-era Xue Youxi, Li Shaowei, and Cheng Xuanying; compiled by Chen Jingyuan of the Song.

*Primordial Boundless Deliverance of Beings, Supreme Wondrous Scripture*

Youxi notes: The earlier title also includes *Supreme Penetrating Numinous Treasure*, while this one simply reads *Primordial Boundless Deliverance of Beings*. The preface is titled *Supreme* to clarify that it is the Supreme who prefaces the scripture. The former encompasses the entire corpus by rank, while the latter specifies the name of this single scripture. *Supreme Wondrous Scripture* shares the same meaning as the first annotation.

Shaowei notes: The earlier section is the Dao Lord’s preface to the scripture, hence it begins with *Dao*; this is the Heavenly Venerable’s own discourse, so it bears *Primordial* as its title. The portion before *Naturally* is the Dao Lord’s brief preface; from *Chaos* onward is the Heavenly Venerable’s original text.

*Primordial Penetrating Mystery, Numinous Treasure Original Text*

Dong observes: *Primordial* means "first." It exists before heaven, hence "first." It also means "great," for it encompasses all without exception, hence "great." It also means "*qi*," for it permeates all that is subtle, hence "*qi*." It also means "none," for it is formless and shadowless, hence "none." It also means "numinous," for it can transform and change, hence "numinous." It also means "Dao," as the scripture says: "The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao." It clarifies that the constant Dao is formless and cannot be named, so its nature is only briefly described. *Beginning* means "to congeal," for the *qi* congeals at the outset, hence "congeal." It also means "initial," for the jade script first opens, hence "initial." It also means "transformation," for it gives birth to heaven and earth, hence "transformation." It also means "origin," for it is the head of the myriad things, hence "origin." It also means "end," for it ends without ending, hence "end." The scripture says: "Nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth"; it also says: "The world has a beginning, which serves as the mother of the world"; and further: "When the beginning first established names," hence "the beginning gives birth to the One." The One is heaven. Heaven is born from the beginning, thus the beginning is also primordial. All returns to the primordial.

When the primordial was born, there was no heaven, no earth, no gods, no ghosts—only vast, indistinct chaos, without distinction. The primordial *qi* first congealed to form the jade script. Jade is the essence of the natural. When essence emerges, it radiates light to form heaven and earth, the sun and moon, and the stars. Thus, the numinous Primordial Venerable is transformed, revealing its spirituality. Thus, heaven and earth, the sun and moon, and the stars are transformed to nurture the myriad beings. After heaven, earth, and the myriad beings are born, they receive names, demonstrating the creative power of the Primordial. The name *Primordial* is given to show people the return to the beginning and end.

*Penetrating* means "illuminating." It shines boundlessly, hence "illuminating." It also means "pervading," for it reaches all without limit, hence "pervading." *Mystery* means "emptiness." Profound and empty, hence "emptiness." The primordial *qi* congeals to form the jade script within the empty mystery, pervading and illuminating the four directions, manifest in the Dragon Han, concealed in the Yan Kang, preceding the Crimson Clarity, shining in the Kai Huang, and extending to the Shang Huang.

*Numinous* is the general term for all sages. *Treasure* is what all sages cherish. *Scripture* means "patterned writing." When the jade script first emerged, its original form resembled a seal, with eight corners radiating light, its patterns and colors resplendent, penetratingly responding without end.

In heaven it is called *numinous*, on earth it is called *treasure*; in empty mystery it is numinous, when stored within it becomes treasure—hence the term *Numinous Treasure*. The Most High Dao Lord expounded its origin.

○ The *Lesser Mystery* states: The primordial subtle words, universally pervading the wondrous mystery, numinous script and precious writ, their sounds and rhythms forming patterned writing. The supreme wondrous beginning, ten revolutions to deliver humanity.

The East says: The *supreme* refers to the primordial *qi* first congealing into the green, yellow, and white *qi*, placed within the Three Palaces of the Upper Primordium. The first palace is named the *Mystic Capital Primordial Yang Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace*. The *qi* of the incipient yang governs all perfected beings of the upper realm by nature, the Jade Void Lofty August Thearch, all celestial thearchs and kings, and the great divine sages of the upper realm—its officials number fifty-five million, five hundred fifty-five thousand, five hundred fifty-five myriad layers. The *qi* of the green yang, its officials and attendants likewise numbering fifty-five million, five hundred fifty-five thousand, five hundred fifty-five myriad, all congeal the natural green yang *qi* to form humans, their robes being green feathered flying garments. Within the palace lies the *Longevity-Extending Talisman*; when the *qi* of the eight directions suddenly arrives, it instantly forms a person. If the talisman is destroyed and the body burned, it immediately transforms into *qi* and disperses with the smoke.

The *Great Mystery Upper Treasury Purple Tenuity Palace* contains three treasuries: left, right, and central. The left treasury governs the Palace of Life, where the Great Yang Fire Officials examine; the right treasury governs the Palace of Death, where the Great Yin Water Officials examine; the central treasury governs the records of life, death, and transgressions, where the Wind Blade examines. Each of the three treasuries commands ninety million officials and attendants, collectively overseeing the twelve bureaus of life, death, transgressions, and blessings. The left palace is named the *Great Mystery Capital Primordial Yellow Great Ultimate Left Palace*, where the primordial yellow *qi* governs all perfected beings—those who have attained the Dao and those who have not, male and female cultivators of the true—recording their lives. Within this palace lies the *Summoning Numinous Talisman*. The right palace is named the *Great Mystery Cavern White Great Ultimate Right Palace*, where the celestial primordial cavernous white *qi* governs all perfected beings who have attained the Dao and those who have not, male and female cultivators of the true—recording their deliverance, immortal registers, transgression ledgers, and death records. Within the palace lies the *Clarifying the True Treasury*, its officials and attendants’ ranks and protocols identical to those of the Purple Tenuity Palace.

The Three Palaces of the Upper Primordium collectively contain three treasuries, each palace overseeing twelve bureaus, the three palaces together comprising thirty-six bureaus. All govern the upper realm of primordial yang and the midst of the great void, bearing natural designations and universally overseeing all perfected beings who have attained the Dao. On the Three Primordial Days, they assemble to review the yin and yang, water, fire, and Wind Blade treasuries, examining the thirty-six bureaus, the green and black ledgers, and present their reports to the Purple Tenuity, Supreme Tenuity left, right, and central palaces. These matters are fully expounded in the *Precepts of the Three Primordia*; here, only a corner is briefly presented.

In the era of Dragon Han, the jade script first emerged, the sun and moon first shone, heaven and earth became distinct, and the multitude of perfected beings took their places. The Primordial Beginning issued the Dharma to deliver humanity. Reciting the scripture ten times, circling the ten directions, it delivered an immeasurable number of beings. The Primordial Beginning thus composed the ten sections of wondrous scriptures, inscribing them with purple brush upon the *kongqing* forest. Revered by all sages as the ancestral origin of scriptures, it is called the *supreme wondrous beginning*.

○ The *Hidden Dweller* says: This was the time of scripture’s unfolding, hence the comprehensive exposition of its themes and purport. Reciting it ten times enables the deliverance of beings, so the Primordial Beginning recited it ten times to summon the ten directions, each time taking ten recitations as the method. Thus, the preceding preface states: Whoever recites this scripture ten times delivers all their ancestors across billions of kalpas—this is also the meaning of the Dharma Wheel revolving ten times.

○ The *Lesser Mystery* says: These verses, though few in words, encompass vast matters. They are called the *supreme true scripture*, the beginning of the wondrous Dao. Ten revolutions of the wheel broadly deliver celestial and human beings.

○ The *Mystic Splendor* says: Among the ranks of all scriptures, this is the foremost. *Wondrous beginning* refers to this scripture containing the method to deliver humanity, serving as the origin of all wonders—hence the name *wondrous beginning*. *Ten revolutions to deliver humanity* means the Heavenly Worthy’s recitation of the scripture to deliver beings follows a set number of repetitions: ten recitations make one revolution, one hundred recitations make ten revolutions.

The *hundred demons* conceal their *rhythms*, parting and uniting by nature.

The East says: The *hundred demons* are the Divine Empyrean Kings and the like. *Concealed* refers to the jade script; *rhythm* means modulation. The demon kings arise with the various *qi*, intermingling with the cavernous scriptures, concealing their rhythmic modulations to harmonize with the natural writ, forming the scriptures.

○ The *Hidden Dweller* says: This refers to the demon kings concealing their names and the secret scriptures of the three realms, their concealment and revelation, parting and uniting, all in accord with nature.

○ The *Lesser Mystery* says: At that time, none among celestial beings, humans, ghosts, or spirits failed to submit to transformation. Thus, the great demons of the three realms led their demonic hosts to conceal and refine their sounds and rhythms, coming to pay homage to the Primordial Beginning. Parting from the *qi* of flying mystery, uniting with the sounds of nature, stirred by the numinous wind, they all became songs and chants. The Most High treasured them, incorporating them into the scriptural text.

○ The *Mystic Splendor* says: This describes how the Heavenly Worthy’s recitation of the scripture moved the demonic hosts of the three realms to fly through the air, singing the concealed rhythms, all coming to pay homage. *Concealed rhythms* means these numinous scriptures are the natural, hidden sounds of the celestial perfected beings above—unknown to the world, hence called *concealed rhythms*. *Rhythm* refers to the formation of parallel lines into patterned writing; *sound* is the harmony of the five tones. Together, they are called *concealed rhythms*. *Natural* means these numinous scriptures are the wondrous *qi* of the celestial realms, stirred by the numinous wind to spontaneously form songs and chants, not artificially composed—hence called *natural*. *Parting and uniting* means the demon kings of the three realms each sing the natural wondrous *qi* of their heavens as songs and melodies—this is called *parting*. Their sounds intermingle with the cavernous scriptures, their principles harmonizing with the wondrousness of nature—hence called *uniting*. *Intermingling* means mixing; though their sounds and words are mixed, their principles accord with nature—hence called *parting and uniting by nature*.

Further explanation states: *Parting* means the Heavenly Worthy speaks, and the demon kings also speak, each expounding their own—hence called *parting*. Though their sounds differ, their principles accord with true wondrousness—hence called *parting and uniting by nature*.

The *Hun-dong Red Script* is the Supreme Perfected of the Non-None.
Dong says: *Hun* means great; *dong* means penetrating. The *Red Script* and *Red Writ* are the scriptures of the Great Cavern, illumining the Dragon Han and pervading the Yan-kang. When the Primordial Beginning opened the kalpa in the Cavern Yang Palace, it forged jade characters in fire, and the *qi* of Cavern Yang was red—thus named *Red Script*. It emerged to ordain humanity, refining the Perfected within the Perfected in the Jade Clarity realm—hence called the Supreme Perfected of the Non-None.

You-xi says: *Hun* is the name of primordial chaos; *dong* is the *qi* of Cavern Yang. *Red Script* refers to the true writ of red script. This true writ of red script, coeval with the inception of chaos, predates heaven and earth, congealing above the empty cavern and coalescing within the Great None. The *none* of the Great None is itself non-none; having no none, it is called the Non-None. Thus it is called the Supreme Perfected of the Non-None. The Primordial Beginning refined it with the *qi* of Cavern Yang and tempered it in the Flowing Fire Court; the *qi* of Cavern Yang was red—hence called *Red Writ*.

Shao-wei says: *Hun-dong* is the nine hundred million *qi* of the Highest Jade Emperor. The *qi* of the Jade Emperor, primordial and all-pervading, formed the true writ of red script, which at the time of the Non-None and the Not-Yet-Had was distributed across the five directions. The Primordial Beginning employed it to deliver humanity, all ascending to the rank of the Supreme Perfected.

The Primordial Beginning, the ancestral kalpa, gave birth to the myriad heavens.
Dong says: *Ancestral* means prior. Before the Primordial Beginning received its title, it had already given birth to heaven and earth. Yet the Dragon Han was remote and boundless; the kalpic cycle first unfolded, and heaven and earth were divided. All that preceded this cannot be recorded or known. Thus, observing the ancient allows one to know the present—ancient and present are no different.

You-xi says: The true writ of red script, at the inception of the ancestral kalpa, gave birth to the thirty-two heavens. The *ancestral kalpa* is the kalpa of Red Clarity.

Shao-wei says: *Ancestral* means beginning. The mysterious primordial *qi* at the dawn of the first kalpa suddenly brought forth transformation, generating the five hundred million heavens. As heaven and earth undergo one completion and one destruction, this is called one kalpa. The *first kalpa* refers to the world’s initial arising, before any completion or destruction. The *illumination of the three luminaries* is called the root of heaven.

Dong says: The *three luminaries* are the three lights. Once the three lights were bright, heaven and earth divided, the myriad things were born, and the spirits gained governance—thus becoming the eternal root of heaven. It also illumines the sun and moon and brightens the host of stars.

Shao-wei says: When the two modes took form, the three lights hung in radiance, all receiving the primordial *qi*—hence the root of heaven.

Xuan-ying says: *Luminaries* means light. This describes the formation of the heavens’ positions, whereupon the three lights arrayed their radiance, universally illuminating the cosmos—hence called *illumination*. All were formed by wondrous *qi*, thus the root of heaven.

Above, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is its body.
Dong says: *Ancestor* means origin. Above, there is no origin; only the *qi* of the Dao coalesces into essence and thereafter forms its body.

You-xi says: Having equaled the things of primordial chaos and predated heaven and earth, it is said that above, there is no further ancestor. The substance of the true writ is the body of the Dao’s truth as writ—hence only the Dao is its body.

Xuan-ying says: This presents the true writ’s essence as the root of the myriad heavens, receiving the spontaneous wondrous *qi* of the Primordial Beginning and transforming into the Dharma-body of the Great Dao. The wondrous *qi* forms itself; there is no further prior ancestor. The *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: “The Void gives birth to spontaneity; spontaneity gives birth to the Dao.” Here, it says *above, there is no further ancestor*: the Dao takes the Void as its origin, spontaneity as its root, and the Dao as its body. Yet these three are all without form or appearance. Tracing their principle, one finds true emptiness. Within the true is essence, fundamentally without name. When the sage established the teachings, their traces could not lack an origin—thus the Void was taken as the Dao’s ancestor. In truth, the three bodies all converge in the One True, utterly without form or appearance, yet able to penetrate the myriad wonders—hence: *above, there is no further ancestor*. *Further* means distinct; there is no distinct prior ancestor.

The five writs open and expand, universally planting the divine spirits.
You-xi says: The *five writs* are the five chapters of the true writ, corresponding to the five directions and the five elders who record them. Having illuminated the three lights, they also opened and expanded the five chapters of the jade-character true writ, each planting the divine spirits.

Shao-wei says: The wondrous root forms itself, without further prior ancestor. All-encompassing and boundless, it is entirely the Dao’s body. The five chapters of the true writ open and expand their forms, universally generating heaven and earth and establishing the divine spirits.

Without writ, there is no light; without writ, there is no clarity.
Dong says: *Light* refers to the three lights; *clarity* means distinctness. If the jade characters do not emerge, the sun and moon have no light, and heaven and earth are indistinct.

Without writ, there is no establishment; without writ, there is no completion.
Dong says: *Establishment* means form; *completion* means generation. If the jade writ does not emerge, heaven and earth have no form, and the myriad things have no generation.

Without writ, there is no deliverance; without writ, there is no life.
Dong says: *Deliverance* means ascent; *life* means transformation. If the true writ does not emerge, the hun-souls have no ascent, and the myriad things have no transformation.

Shao-wei says: Without the true writ’s expansion, the sun and moon would not shine, the stars would not be bright, heaven and earth would not stand, the world would not be completed, the hidden souls would not be delivered, and the dry bones would not live.

Xuan-ying says: The three paths, eight difficulties, and five sufferings of the hidden souls—without this true writ, they cannot transcend the three realms. It also clarifies that those who cultivate and study without this true writ cannot attain perfection and enter the Dao.

This is the Great Brahma, the Heaven among Heavens.

Dong says: The *Great Brahma* refers to the primordial qi of the vast Wind-and-Marsh Brahma coalescing to form heaven. Suspended within the void, it rises in clarity, lofty and boundlessly floating, hanging yet never falling, above all other heavens—thus it is called the Heaven among Heavens. Yu-xi says: Since its creative power is vast and its transformative work all-encompassing, it is called the Great Brahma. *Brahma* is the Dao within the Dao. The Dao is the mysterious writ, hence it is called the Dao within the Dao, the Mystery within the Mystery. *Heaven* is the profound.

Shao-wei says: *Fan* means model. By its power, it illuminates the Three Radiant Ones and establishes the Five Writs—all through the Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s enactment of the great law, which abides above all heavens, hence it is called the Heaven among Heavens.

The Yu-luo Xiao Terrace, the Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital.

Dong says: *Yu* means flourishing; *luo* is the Great Luo. Above the Great Luo Heaven stands the Jade Capital Mountain, upon which rests the Seven Treasures’ Mystic Terrace. The terrace lies within a seven-jeweled city, and within the city stands the Jade Clarity Palace, where the Most High Jade Emperor governs. Yu-xi says: Above the Jade Clarity are nine-tiered terraces, reaching the utmost heights, merging with the Great Void—thus they shine resplendent above the flourishing Great Luo, the nine-tiered Xiao Terrace. The *Great Void* is the Great Luo. As the mountain is of jade, it is called the Jade Mountain. Above the mountain lies the capital, hence the Upper Capital; it is also named the Jade Capital, or Jade Clarity, all derived from jade. This is commonly called the Mystic Capital Jade Capital.

Shao-wei says: These ten lines all describe the splendor of the palaces within the Mystic Capital. The Jade Capital Mountain stands above all realms, hence the Upper Capital. The mountain bears a jade city, and within the city lies a terrace named the Xiao Terrace. The city gates, towers, and forests flourish in ordered array—all the domain where the Most High Jade Emperor governs.

Xuan-ying says: *Yu-luo* refers to the city gates, towers, and forests surrounding the Xiao Terrace, lush with radiant splendor, spreading in ordered brilliance—hence it is called Yu-luo.

Supreme beyond the supreme, the Great Luo Jade Clarity.

Dong says: The Great Luo Heaven stands above all heavens; the Purple Tenuity Palace rests above the Jade Clarity, resplendent within the Purple Void. When the luminous Dao is manifest, the Great Luo Heaven becomes serene and clear, its seven-jeweled trees each growing in one direction, covering one heaven; eight trees cover eight heavens, enveloping all heavens—thus it is called the Great Luo.

Yu-xi says: The Jade Capital ascends to the utmost limit, exhausting the boundless—only the Great Luo’s Jade Clarity remains. The *Great Luo* is the Void’s radiance; the *Jade Clarity* is its palaces.

Shao-wei says: The realm of the Great Luo Jade Clarity reaches the utmost heights and distances, with nothing above it to encompass all heavens—hence it is said: above the Great Luo, dustless and vast, lies the Dao’s realm of non-action.

Xuan-ying says: The *Original Form Sutra* states: above the Great Luo, there is no color, no dust—this is the supreme.

Vast and distant, the kalpa’s measure, as if absent, as if present.

Dong says: *Vast and distant* describes its height. One *kalpa* is like a colossal stone, four hundred leagues in each direction; or like an empty city, four hundred leagues in each direction, equal in height and breadth, filled with mustard seeds. Every hundred years, a heavenly being removes one mustard seed. When the stone is worn away by a silk robe and the mustard seeds are exhausted, this is called one kalpa. The seven-foot *ren* blade exists or does not exist. The seven-jeweled mystic terrace stands as high as countless *ren* of mustard seeds—this is the Terrace of Kalpa Measures, seen in the floating clouds above. The seven-jeweled terrace is unseen even by earthbound immortals, let alone mortals! Those who behold it say it exists; those who do not say it is absent—hence it is said to be as if absent, as if present.

Yu-xi says: *Ren* is a measure. Ancient script had few characters, so *ren* was used for *ren*. Heavenly perfected ones measure *ren* by kalpas, while mortals measure *ren* by feet—this is the nine-tiered terrace of Jade Clarity, also called the Terrace of Kalpa Measures. Since it is vast, distant, and mysteriously transformed without fixed form, it is said to be as if absent, as if present—not a definite appearance. Though it has form, it lacks substance; the true essence’s transformations arise naturally.

Shao-wei says: According to the *True One’s Natural Scripture*, the Jade Mountain is also called the Terrace of Kalpa Measures. Its height is measured like the kalpas, hence the term *kalpa-ren*. It has form yet does not obstruct, as if present, as if absent.

The Three Flowers depart from the Three Conveniences, the Great Existence’s wondrous court.

Dong says: The *Three Flowers* refer to the names of the gates of the Supreme Ultimate Palace’s Azure Flower Gate. The *Three Conveniences* are the names of the Three Realms’ gates. The Three Flowers lie above the Three Realms, where Brahma-heaven’s divine beings soar above the Supreme Ultimate, singing boundless cavernous hymns. The qi of the numinous wind brushes and lifts the melodies of the cavernous hymns. Jade Maidens of Great Harmony harmonize the divine beings’ songs at the Flower Capital’s gates, celebrating the Great Existence before the Primordial Beginning and rejoicing in the multitude of perfected ones within the wondrous court. Not departing from the Three Realms, it is called *departing from the Conveniences*.

Yu-xi says: To enter the feasting halls of the Three Clarities’ palaces, one must first depart from the Three Conveniences’ gates—the gates of the Three Realms. The *Three Flowers Palace* is the Jade Clarity’s Three Origins Palace. The Upper Origin’s Jade Flower, the Middle Origin’s Golden Flower, and the Lower Origin’s Nine Flowers are all the abodes of the Three Origins’ August Lords of the Dao. The *Great Existence* is the Great Dao, its meaning akin to the Great Mass, its principle equal to all things. Since the Three Flowers Palace is the abode of the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Dao, it is called the Great Existence’s wondrous court.

Golden gates and jade chambers, arrayed in purity and clarity.

Dong says: Within heaven lie golden gates and jade chambers, which mark the boundaries of the Three Conveniences’ gates.

Verdant and towering, vast as the Great Net. Above stand the *Qian* Forests’ trees, their canopies shading the Eastern Florescence Palace. The leaves of the *Qian* Forests bear the script of the Great Cavern, inscribed in purple on jade, resplendent in the Upper Clarity. *Jingying* is the inner name of the Supervising Deity of the Capital, who governs the Purple Tenuity Palace. Within its winding chambers below grows the Fusang tree, above flourish the *Qian* Forests’ groves. Azure fowl cry beneath their boughs, blue mists and emerald vapors crown their peaks. Divine winds stir the fragrant grasses of reversal, setting the hundred reeds of the Mulberry Grove to music. When the divine wind stirs once, the void births the sound of Cavern Script.

Dong says: The realm of Jade Clarity is walled in yellow gold and roofed in white jade. Its golden gates stand tall and radiant, arrayed about the white jade chambers, which are pure, solemn, and lustrous as crystal.

Shaowei says: Encircling the Three Conveniences’ halls and tracing the Great Existence’s palace, one finds golden gates, jade chambers, *Qian* Forests, purple trees—all verdant, towering, and arrayed in pristine clarity.

Xuanying says: *Que* means gate. This describes the wondrous adornments within the Jade Capital’s walls: gates wrought of amassed gold, chambers built of heaped jade, encircling the Great Existence’s palace and the Three Conveniences’ halls. Planted throughout stand the *Qian* Forests and purple trees, verdant and towering, pure and crystalline. Dwelling therein is surpassingly sublime—hence *jingying*.

The Great Conduct’s *fanqi* pervades the ten directions.

Dong says: The Great Conduct is the Heavenly Origin’s guiding principle. It binds the eight poles, unifying the Great Brahma’s *qi*, and illumines the Dragon Han’s gates. The Dragon Han unfolds by reckoning, while the Crimson Clarity awaits its turn to spread the celestial bodies. Once the Crimson Clarity opens, the thirty-two heavens all bear divine spirits, and the Middle Origin’s second-rank Earth Officials are established. The *qi* of the Primordial Cavern’s mixed numina, the essence of congealed yellow, establishes the Middle Origin’s Three Offices. The first palace is named the Cavern Numen’s Pure Void Palace, which governs the Five Thearchs, the Five Marchmounts, all Perfected Ones, and the earthly immortals who have attained the Dao. Another name is the Luminous Dawn’s Martial Accomplishment Palace, which houses the left, right, and central bureaus. The left bureau is called the Enduring Transgression Luminous Dawn Bureau, governing the life offices and the Great Yang Fire Officials’ examinations. The right bureau is called the Execration-Cutting Yin Heaven Bureau, governing the death offices and the Great Yin Water Officials’ examinations. The central bureau is called the Seven Wrongs’ Tranquil Illumination Bureau, governing the records of life-and-death transgressions and the trials of the Wind Blade. Each bureau commands fifty million officials, overseeing fourteen departments of life, death, transgression, and fortune. They all reside within the hollows of mountains and caverns, sustained by the Great Brahma’s *qi*.

Youxi says: The Jade Clarity’s true Dao’s *fanqi* flows through the ten directions’ realms and circulates through all the heavens’ domains.

Shaowei says: Encompassing the five hundred million heavens and blending the eight spheres’ warp and weft, it descends to the nine earths’ depths and ascends to the Great Net’s bounds. Everywhere the *fanqi* flows ceaselessly, so that the myriad worlds, though lofty and floating, remain suspended without falling. Its form resembles wind yet is not wind, resembles water yet is not water. It upholds and sustains as if sentient and trustworthy. Within it dwells the spirit of delivering people from death.

Dong says: The spirit who delivers people and grants rebirth is called the Flying Life Scholar, who recites the Cavern Script. All the heavens rejoice, and the Flying Life opens the gate of deathlessness, streaming the *qi* of eternal life to refine the three *hun*. When the three *hun* spirits are refined, the Eight Effulgences abide within. Once the Eight Effulgences are complete and guard the body, they together uplift the person to ascend the nine-tiered terrace, wander amid the *Qian* Forests, and ascend to the Mystery Capital’s palace.

Youxi says: This refers to the spirit in the ten directions’ heavens who oversees the deliverance of the world from death—not that the spirit itself is deathless.

Within it dwells the Southern Culmen’s Lord of Eternal Life.

Dong says: The Southern Culmen is the Perfected of the Southern Culmen. The Middle Origin’s second rank includes the left palace, named the Cavern Yang Palace, also called the Ancestral Heaven Palace, which governs the Nine Lands’ Earth Thearchs and the spirits of the four corners and eight poles. The *qi* of mixed yellow therein, the Central Earth Bureau, and the earthly officials examine ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety-nine thousand souls—all the spirits of the deceased who have meritorious deeds, who receive deliverance and fill their ranks. This palace houses the left, right, and central bureaus. The left bureau is called the Veracious Affairs Bureau, the right bureau the Ancestral Numen Bureau, and the central bureau the Numinous As-If-Divine Bureau. The three bureaus’ examining officials follow the above method, governing the fourteen departments of life and death. The Middle Origin’s second rank includes the right palace, named the Northern Feng Palace, also called the Yin Heaven Palace, which governs all the earthly spirits. It houses the left, right, and central bureaus. The left bureau is called the Linked Bay’s Winding Springs Bureau, the right bureau the Grand Execution’s Nine Darks Bureau, and the central bureau the Transgression *Qi*’s Celestial Pool Bureau. They govern life and death as the Middle Origin’s second rank. The earthly Three Offices’ left, right, and central bureaus each have three bureaus, overseeing fourteen departments, all residing within the hollows of mountains and caverns—all naturally designated titles. On the eight seasonal days, the Five Marchmounts’ earthly gods, the spirits of the four corners and eight poles, the immortals, and the Perfected Ones descend to the Pure Numen’s Cavern Yang and Northern Feng Palaces to assemble and review the earthly records of life and death, merit and transgression, fortune and misfortune. When all the officials arrive, the three palaces’ nine bureaus and forty-two departments summon their subordinates to examine life and death. Blue and black registers list the three palaces’ affairs. The Perfected of the Southern Culmen governs the Cavern Yang Palace, below which lies the Flowing Fire’s Court. Those who attain the Dao all proceed to the Flowing Fire’s Court to receive refinement and become Perfected, then enter the Cavern Yang Palace among the eternally living. Within the palace dwells the Lord of Delivering Destiny, named Xu Yuanyuan. Those who enter the Southern Palace’s Xu Yuanyuan are refined and have their decayed bones delivered.

Youxi says: The south governs life, hence the Southern Culmen’s additional title as the overseer of eternal life.

Shaowei says: The Flowing Fire’s Court spans eight hundred thousand li. Within it resides the Great Divine Marshal of Delivering the World. Dong says: In the Southern Palace dwells the Great Divine Marshal of Delivering the World, where the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the ten directions all govern within the palace. Youxi says: The Great Divine Marshal oversees the registers of delivering the world. *Simā* is an official rank.

Shaowei says: The Southern Palace also has a Marshal of Delivering the World, as well as a Great Divine One of Delivering the World, both governing within the palace, attaining eternal life without death. Within it dwells the Venerable Lord Han of Cherishing Life. Dong says: The Lord of Cherishing Life, whose taboo name is You, governs within the Southern Upper Palace. Lord Han oversees life and registers, ruling the Nine Dark Hells of Fengdu. For those who have accumulated virtuous merit, the Great Sage opens the Gate of the Dark Night, and Fengdu delivers them from the Eight Perils’ realm. Their seven ancestors thus return, and their dark souls are illuminated. The Supreme Emperor nurtures and fosters the newly born spirits, while the Registrar calculates their deliverance in the Southern Palace.

Youxi says: There is also the Venerable Lord Han who oversees the registers of eternal life, his duties akin to those of the Southern Culmen. Among the divine, he is called *Zhangren* (Venerable Elder). *Han Jun* is the title of his official post. Shaowei says: Lord Han is the Registrar of Immortal Registers beneath the Supreme Emperor’s threshold, delivering people in the Southern Palace. Xuanying says: *Zhangren* is a term of respect for elders. *Hao* means "to delight in." This clarifies that within the Southern Palace there is also a Lord who delights in people’s eternal life without death, recording their virtuous merit and delivering them from the suffering of the Three Realms.

Within it dwell the Southern Upper Registrars of Life and Records. Dong says: The Southern Upper Palace is its name. The Nine Radiance Perfected governs within it, presiding over the karmic retribution of dead souls in the Nine Dark Hells. The Registrar of Life oversees the spirit of lifespan, while the Registrar of Records oversees the recording of merits. Both are officials of the Southern Supreme Emperor, constantly reviewing the names of those who cultivate immortality. As mentioned earlier, among the officials of the Mysterious Capital, those who know the eight-character resonance of deliverance—when the time of calamity and kalpa converges—the Registrar of Life dispatches the Bird Mother to welcome them with a phoenix chariot, ascending to the Kunlun wastes.

Xuanying says: The Southern Upper Palace is another name for the Cavern Yang Palace. It extends lifespan and increases destiny. Dong says: *Yan* means "to extend," and *suan* means "to record." The Mother of the Nine Numinous Ones governs the Abyss of Fusang and Tanggu in the Eastern Sea, constantly overseeing the turning of the Earth’s Mechanism, with primordial *qi* ascending to respond to the Celestial Pass. When the Celestial Pass turns and the Earth’s Mechanism moves through one revolution of the heavens, the waters surge three thousand three hundred times. The Nine Seas merge, and the Mother of Earth emerges above the Eastern Sea to summon the Bird Mother, extending the kalpa’s convergence before the Emperor. She prolongs lifespan and increases its record, delivering those who cultivate immortality.

The Venerable Divine One of Delivering from Calamity. Dong says: Within the Southern Upper Palace dwells the Venerable Divine One of Prolonging Life and Extending Years, the Divine One of Delivering from Calamity, the Supreme Emperor’s Lord. His taboo name is Yuchang. He rides a chariot of elephant wheels, traversing the Nine Mysterious Gates, turning the Nine Mechanisms’ measures to respond to the kalpa’s convergence and the end of heaven’s revolution. When the Sun Child halts its light, he delivers those who cultivate immortality, bathing them in the essence of the Water Mother and guiding them with the *qi* of Great Harmony. He delivers them from calamity and refines the corpses of the Long Night.

Youxi says: There are also the two Venerable Divine Ones of the Southern Registrars of Life and Records. The Venerable Divine Registrar of Life oversees extending lifespan and increasing destiny, while the Venerable Divine Registrar of Records oversees transcending calamities and delivering from peril. They revive skeletons and raise the dead, delivering countless people. Dong says: The Immeasurable One is the primordial spirit of the great multitude, governing the hosts of Flying Heavenly Beings. Within the Heaven of Delight, there are immeasurable ranks of great sages, all of whom receive their measure and ascend, delivering the dead skeletons, receiving *qi*, and being reborn as humans.

Youxi says: Those who extend lifespan, increase destiny, transcend calamities, deliver from peril, revive the forms of the dead, and restore the corpses of the deceased all rely on the two Lords of Life and Records. Thus, it is said they deliver countless people. Shaowei says: All those Perfected Officials, each governing their duties, can revive skeletons and restore life, raise the dead and complete rebirth. As kalpas repeatedly converge, they deliver countless people. Xuanying says: These two lines summarize the preceding text. From "Within it dwells the Marshal of Delivering the World" to all these Perfected Officials, they can revive skeletons and raise the dead, delivering living beings. *Bones become skeletons; skeletons are forms.* They can cause the dead skeletons and white bones to rise again and become human. *Raising the dead* refers to those newly deceased, enabling them to live again. *Delivering countless people* means that in kalpa after kalpa, they deliver people to attain the Dao, beyond calculation. Thus, it is called delivering countless people. This illustrates how the Primordial Beginning extends compassion, connecting life and death, establishing golden palaces and jade halls. All those Perfected Officials illuminate the Three Realms, broadly delivering the Nine Heavens. People, whether living or dead, receive blessings; all things, whether moving or still, bear gratitude. In kalpa after kalpa, they attain eternal life and long vision.

Today, the records are reviewed, and the various heavens descend to the imperial terrace. Dong says: *Reviewing records* means examining the records of life and death. *Descending to the imperial terrace* means holding a banquet. The Jade Emperor, within the Southern Prosperity Palace, reviews and delivers the registers of life and death, universally granting amnesty. Youxi says: *Today’s review of records* refers to assessing the names of those who uphold recitations and establish meritorious conduct, whose records should be elevated and delivered. Thus, the immeasurable divine Perfected of the ten directions ride their carriages and wield their brushes, ascending before the Emperor.

Shaowei says: *Today* refers to the day when the Crimson Clarity unfolds the chart. *Reviewing records* means examining the registers of life and death. On the day of reviewing records, one may refer to it as "today." At this time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable reviews the registers of life and death, and the sagely hosts of the various heavens all descend to the imperial terrace to pay court.

The Immeasurable Deliverer of People, the Great Sage of Eternal Life, the Flying Heavenly Divine King of the Eastern Infinite. Dong says: The Most High spoke of the Mysterious Capital’s Jade Capital Mountain, where the eight directions’ various heavens contain three thousand great thousand-worlds. The Eastern Infinite Heavens of the Eastern Direction are the Great Thousand World of Accepting Goodness in the Peaceful Hall Village.

Youxī says: As stated in the preceding preface: when the scripture is recited once, the great deities of the Eastern Direction arrive floating through the air.

The Immeasurable Deliverer of People, the Great Sage of Eternal Life, the Flying Heavenly Divine King of the Southern Infinite.
Dong says: The Southern Infinite Heavens of the Southern Direction are the Great Thousand World of Abandoning Worthies in the Wondrous Pear City.

Youxī says: When the scripture is recited twice, the great deities of the Southern Direction arrive floating through the air.

The Immeasurable Deliverer of People, the Great Sage of Eternal Life, the Flying Heavenly Divine King of the Western Infinite.
Dong says: The Western Infinite Heavens of the Western Direction are the Great Thousand World of Universal Practice in the Blessed Hall Continent.

Youxī says: When the scripture is recited thrice, the great deities of the Western Direction arrive floating through the air.

The Immeasurable Deliverer of People, the Great Sage of Eternal Life, the Flying Heavenly Divine King of the Northern Infinite.
Dong says: The Northern Infinite Heavens of the Northern Direction are the Great Thousand World of Cool Purity in the Fragrant Sandalwood Wilds.

Youxī says: When the scripture is recited four times, the great deities of the Northern Direction arrive floating through the air.

The Immeasurable Deliverer of People, the Great Sage of Eternal Life, the Flying Heavenly Divine King of the Northeastern Infinite.
Dong says: The Northeastern Infinite Heavens of the Northeastern Direction are the Great Thousand World of Eternal Peace in the Blessed Assembly Capital.

Youxī says: When the scripture is recited five times, the great deities of the Northeastern Direction arrive floating through the air.

The Immeasurable Deliverer of People, the Great Sage of Eternal Life, the Flying Heavenly Divine King of the Southeastern Infinite.
Dong says: The Southeastern Infinite Heavens of the Southeastern Direction are the Great Thousand World of Employing Worthies in the Primordial Blessed Field.

Youxī says: When the scripture is recited six times, the great deities of the Southeastern Direction arrive floating through the air.

The Immeasurable Deliverer of People, the Great Sage of Eternal Life, the Flying Heavenly Divine King of the Southwestern Infinite.
Dong says: The Southwestern Infinite Heavens of the Southwestern Direction are the Great Thousand World of Benevolent Stillness in the Extended Blessing Village.

Youxī says: When the scripture is recited seven times, the great deities of the Southwestern Direction arrive floating through the air.

The Immeasurable Deliverer of People, the Great Sage of Eternal Life, the Flying Heavenly Divine King of the Northwestern Infinite.
Dong says: The Northwestern Infinite Heavens of the Northwestern Direction are the Great Thousand World of Extending Worthies in the Blessed Virtue Wilds.

Youxī says: When the scripture is recited eight times, the great deities of the Northwestern Direction arrive floating through the air.

The Immeasurable Deliverer of People, the Great Sage of Eternal Life, the Flying Heavenly Divine King of the Upper Infinite.
Dong says: The Upper Infinite Heavens of the Upper Direction are within the Purple Tenuity of the Jade Treasury of the Mysterious Capital’s peakless summit, where the boundless hosts of Flying Heavenly Divine Kings reside.

Youxī says: When the scripture is recited nine times, the great deities of the Upper Direction arrive floating through the air.

The Immeasurable Deliverer of People, the Great Sage of Eternal Life, the Flying Heavenly Divine King of the Lower Infinite.
Dong says: The Lower Infinite Heavens of the Lower Direction are among the Five Marchmounts and Five Thearchs, within the Northern Fengdu of the Cavernous Yang and Pure Numinosity, and the various bureaus therein.

Youxī says: When the scripture is recited ten times, the great deities of the Lower Direction arrive floating through the air.

The Immeasurable Great Deities, the Great Sages of Eternal Life, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the Ten Directions’ Perfected Realized Ones.
Dong says: In the Great Veil Heavens of the Ten Directions, there is the Jade Capital Mountain, which has eight directions; above and below together make ten directions. Each contains infinite and boundless Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, Lords of Eternal Life and Deliverance, Immeasurable Great Deities, and boundless hosts, all arriving before the Emperor.

Youxī says: These Perfected Deities of the Ten Directions all preside over and oversee the affairs of attaining the Dao, achieving realization, eternal life, and deliverance—hence they are called the Great Sages of Eternal Life and Immeasurable Deliverers of People.

All ride upon flying clouds, crimson chariots, green carriages, feathered canopies, and jade wheels.
Dong says: Flying clouds are of three kinds: white clouds, crimson clouds, and green clouds.

Feathers are pennants; canopies are coverings; *qiong* is jade. The Great Sages of the Ten Directions and the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings each ride upon crimson-cloud chariots and azure-cloud carriages, with Vermilion Birds and phoenixes as the canopies for their chariots and carriages, and seven-jeweled wheel hubs.

Xuan Ying says: Crimson is the rosy glow of dawn, and green is the azure *qi* of the heavens. This clarifies that when the Great Sages of the Ten Directions come to pay homage to the Primordial Beginning, they all form the Supreme Three Pure flying clouds, crimson dawn clouds, and azure celestial clouds into their vehicles—hence the terms "crimson chariots" and "green carriages." They harness Vermilion Phoenixes and five-colored Dark Dragons.

Dong says: *Can* means "to intermingle." They intermingle their harnesses with Vermilion Birds, phoenixes, five-colored dragons, White Tigers, and Dark Warriors.

Youxī says: Feathered canopies shade the chariots and carriages above, while flying clouds race beneath the wheel hubs. Vermilion Phoenixes intermingle with the carriages, and Dark Dragons draw the chariots. Thus, phoenix carriages, cloud chariots, and cloud-*qi* advance in tandem. Feathered canopies are made from the feathers of immortal birds and numinous fowl. Jade wheels are crafted from precious jades such as *gui*, *bi*, *wan*, and *yan*.

Xuan Ying says: Dragons come in five colors, yet they are called "Dark" because *xuan* signifies Heaven—referring to Heavenly Dragons. It is also said that *xuan* is the master of all colors, hence it is specifically mentioned to clarify this.

They erect nine-colored standards and ten *jue*-spirit banners.

Dong says: *Jie* are canopies; *fan* are ornate banners. The nine colors are blue-green, crimson, white, yellow, black, green, red, purple, and deep blue. Perfected Ones hold nine-colored feathered standards, while Jade Maidens grasp ten *jue*-spirit banners.

Youxī says: The Perfected Ones all erect three, seven, or nine-colored standards—purple-feathered standards and spirit-banner standards—interspersed with ten colors, each color forming one *jue*, hence the term "ten *jue*." The standards are held before the banners, grasped in both hands to lead the way.

Shaowei says: The Great Sages of the Ten Directions all ride upon Three Pure flying clouds and crimson-cloud carriages, with phoenix-feathered canopies and jade wheels. *Can* means "to intermingle," and they further intermingle their harnesses with Vermilion Phoenixes and Dark Dragons, their radiance displaying five colors. Jade Maidens erect nine-light standards, while Perfected Ones hold ten *jue*-spirit banners. Their regalia and majestic decor are uniform across all directions.

Xuan Ying says: The ten *jue*-spirit banners are made by cutting horizontal strips of ten-colored silk, each strip severed to form a *jue*, then interspersed and sewn together. When the strips are continuous, ten segments form ten *jue*. They are affixed to the tops of poles and called banners. *Fan* (banners) derive their name from "turning," turning misfortune into fortune. Holding standards ensures that punishments are measured, and no excessive penalties are meted out. Grasping banners enables repentance and cultivation of the Dao, transforming evil into good. The standards and banners erected by the Great Sages enlighten the foolish and deluded. Perfected Ones hold the banners, while Jade Maidens grasp the standards. The rank and status of these insignia follow the regulations, with distinctions in height. For instance, Perfected Ones of the Highest Clarity erect purple-feathered standards, while other ranks are detailed in the ritual codes—this will not be elaborated here.

Ahead, nine phoenixes whistle in unison; behind, eight *luan*-birds sing in harmony.

Dong says: Males are called phoenixes, females *luan*-birds; crimson and five-colored ones are *luan*-birds. Nine divisions of phoenixes lead the way, while eight divisions of *luan*-birds follow. At the first whistle of the dawn, nine phoenixes sing in unison. When the Western Numinous Perfected Ones play the nine-phoenix flutes, the eight *luan*-birds harmonize in response.

Youxī says: Ahead, whistling and singing are met with phoenixes joining in unison; behind, the playing of flutes and pipes is answered by eight *luan*-birds singing in harmony.

Xuan Ying says: The front division belongs to *yang*, and *yang* numbers are odd, hence nine. The rear division belongs to *yin*, and *yin* numbers are even, hence eight.

Lions and white cranes whistle and sing in harmonious resonance.

Dong says: *Yongyong* describes harmonious singing. Phoenixes sing and *luan*-birds call, with all sounds arising together.

Youxī says: Lions roar like tigers, and white cranes sing like phoenixes. Their harmonious resonance blends two sounds in perfect accord.

Shaowei says: This is the music of Heavenly Harmony. The front division whistles and sings, and nine phoenixes join in unison; the rear division plays flowing melodies, and eight *luan*-birds sing in harmony. The *Scripture of Cavernous Divinity* states: "In the left palace of Heavenly Unity, there are instruments of Heavenly Harmony. On the *zi* day, Jade Maidens play the *sheng* and *yu*; on the *chou* day, Jade Maidens whistle and sing; on the *yin* day, Jade Maidens play the *se*; on the *mao* day, Jade Maidens strike the *zhu*; on the *chen* day, Jade Maidens play the *qin*; on the *si* day, Jade Maidens ring bells and strike chimes; on the *wu* day, Jade Maidens play the flute; on the *wei* day, Jade Maidens play the *jia*; on the *shen* day, Jade Maidens sing the nine-tone songs; on the *you* day, Jade Maidens perform the six-variation songs; on the *xu* day, Jade Maidens imitate the cries of a hundred beasts; on the *hai* day, Jade Maidens compose new celestial melodies." Heavenly Harmony is the name of a musical instrument. Its name is the same as those in the world, but its sound differs from the vulgar. Worldly music is mournful and hastens life, while celestial music is harmonious and prolongs life.

Xuan Ying says: This describes lions and white cranes following the procession. When celestial music begins, a hundred beasts dance in unison, hence their voices join in harmonious song.

The Five Elders clear the path, and hosts of immortals flank the shafts.

Dong says: The Five Elders are the Five Emperors. *Qi* means "to open," and *tu* means "path." *Yi* means "to attend," and *yuan* refers to the carriage shafts. When the boundless Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the Ten Directions arrive at the Azure Beginning Heaven, the Five Emperors clear the path, and hosts of immortals attend and guide them.

Youxī says: The Five Elders clear the path ahead, while hosts of immortals attend to the shafts on either side. The Five Elders are the Five Elderly Emperor Lords, who preside over the Five Chapters of the Perfected Writ.

Shaowei says: The Five Elders are the Five Emperors. The exalted positions of the Great Sages of the Ten Directions move the Five Emperors to lead the way, with hosts of immortals harnessing the five talismans. The *Scripture of Fundamental Conduct* states: "In the east, the Azure Numinous Beginning Elder of the Treasure-Fragrant Flower Forest is called the Azure Emperor. His surname is *He*, his taboo name is *Kai*, and his style is *Lingwei Yang*. He favors the color azure, rides a Dark Dragon, raises a green banner, and is accompanied by a retinue of ninety myriad spirits. He harmonizes the spring *qi* and generates the myriad things."

In the south, the Vermilion Numinous True Elder of the Brahma-Treasure Flourishing Yang is called the Vermilion Emperor. His surname is *Dongfu*, his taboo name is *Jiyan*, and his style is *Chibiao Nu*. He favors the color vermilion, rides a Red Dragon, raises a crimson banner, and is accompanied by a retinue of thirty myriad spirits. He harmonizes the summer *qi* and nurtures the myriad things.

At the center, the Jade-Treasure Primordial Numinous Elder is called the Yellow Emperor. His surname is *Tongban*, his taboo name is *Yuanshi*, and his style is *Han Shuniu*. He favors the color yellow, rides a Yellow Dragon, raises a yellow banner, and is accompanied by a retinue of twelve myriad spirits. He harmonizes the *qi* of earth and upholds the Nine Heavens.

In the west, the August Numinous Elder of the Seven-Treasure Golden Gate is called the White Emperor. His surname is *Shangjin*, his taboo name is *Changkai*, and his style is *Yaopo Bao*. He favors the color white, rides a White Dragon, raises a plain banner, and is accompanied by a retinue of seventy myriad spirits. He harmonizes the autumn *qi* and ripens the myriad things.

In the north, the Mysterious Elder of the Profound Yin, Solitary Darkness, and Five Numinosities is called the Black Emperor. His surname is *Heijie*, his taboo name is *Linghui*, and his style is *Yin Houju*. He favors the color black, rides a Black Dragon, raises a dark banner, and is accompanied by a retinue of fifty myriad spirits. He harmonizes the winter *qi* and stores the myriad things.

The Five Elderly Emperor Lords are all celestial perfected spirits of spontaneous origin, hence called the Primordial Beginning. The Five Elders are not formed through later study; the perfected receive their mandates directly, each governing one direction. When great kalpas complete their cycles, their positions still shift.

A hundred million chariots and ten thousand riders arrive floating through the void. The East says: "A hundred million is ten thousand myriad." The chariots are phoenix carriages, the riders are dragon-unicorns. Flying immortals together ride dragon-drawn hosts without number, their phoenix carriages and feathered canopies floating through the void to arrive.

The Recluse says: "A hundred million chariots and ten thousand riders—this clarifies their multitude. Floating through the void, they do not tread upon the earth."

Their radiance tilts, their chariots turn back, overseeing the perfected and delivering the living. The East says: "Tilting is like a canopy. Radiance is the sun. Delivering the living refers to the perfected one, whose style is *Fu Xi*, who constantly oversees the registers of the Nine Dark Regions and the causes of good and evil. Those who are good receive his deliverance; those who are evil face the roots of their transgressions."

At that time, the Great Sages of the Ten Directions tilt the heavens to come, descending to shield the sun’s brilliance. They turn their chariots back to the realms of the various heavens, tilting their radiance before the Supreme Emperor, overseeing those adepts who have cultivated and recited to attain perfection, and delivering the souls of ancestors who are due to be reborn.

The Mysterious Splendor says: "Tilting means moving. Radiance refers to the splendor of chariots, carriages, and vestments. Turning back the chariots means that once the hosts of sages have received the Heavenly Worthy’s mandate, they then tilt their luminous regalia, turn their chariots, and each returns to their own realm, overseeing the hosts of perfected and delivering those who have attained immortality. Thus it is called overseeing the perfected and delivering the living."

The Prime Ministers of the Various Heavens reside in the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace. The East says: "The Prime Ministers are the divine lords of the Great Luo Heaven. The Upper Palace is the Vermilion Numinous Palace. The Prime Ministers serve as guests for those who receive deliverance and rebirth, determining their destinies in the Vermilion Palace and excising the roots of their transgressions in the Three Bureaus."

The Recluse says: "The Nine Palaces have the positions of the Two Perfected Upper Ministers, who assist in the affairs of the various heavens. Thus they reside in the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, which is the south of the Nine Palaces, within the Heaven of Crimson Clarity and Harmonious Yang."

Han presides over the registers. The East says: "Han is the Controller of Destiny."

Those who are destined for deliverance—it is the Controller of Destiny who, holding the register of life-calculations, conducts their refinement and deliverance in the Southern Palace, thereby enabling them to undergo the alchemical refinement and attain deliverance.

The Great Divine Overseer of Birth.
The East says: "The Great Divine Overseer of Birth presides over the Palace of the Endless Night, examining the ledgers of Dao-cultivators and delivering the souls of the Nine Dark Realms. The Great Divine Ones are the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the Ten Directions. They ever abide above the Flying Mystery, reciting the scriptures of the Cavernous Mystery, and by means of the spontaneous qi, they rescue and deliver those who cultivate the Dao."

The Recluse says: "The Han Controller is the same as the Controller of the former Han Lord. The 'Main Register' refers to the register that oversees and monitors longevity, hence it is called the Great Divine Overseer of Birth. Holding the registers and grasping the ledgers, they assemble together before the Emperor."

The East says: "The Great Divine Ones of the Ten Directions each oversee their respective registers, holding the ledgers as they present themselves before the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor’s tabooed name is Kuoyi, and he governs within the Mysterious Terrace of the Jade Capital. Born together with the Primordial Beginning, he is the model of the Mysterious Origin, opening the gate of extinction and deliverance to teach those who study immortality."

The Recluse says: "The Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions, together with the Prime Ministers of the Various Heavens and the Great Divine Overseer of Birth, all carry the registers of deliverance calculations and assemble before the Emperor to promote and elevate the worthy."

The Lesser Mystery says: "The Han Controller is the registrar under the Main Register Office, responsible for the ledgers of human destinies, hence called the Main Register. The Great Divine Overseer of Birth is the Perfected One of Rebirth, named Fu Xi, who presides over the Palace of the Endless Night and delivers the souls of the Nine Dark Realms. At that time, the lords of the various heavens, each leading their prime ministers, assemble before Your Majesty to examine and assess life and death."

The Emperor is the Heavenly Worthy speaking of himself. One of the Heavenly Worthy’s titles is Jade Emperor. According to the *Scripture of the Dragon’s Ascent*, the Primordial Beginning has ten titles: the Spontaneous, the Boundless, the Great Dao, the Utmost Perfected, the Supreme, the Venerable Lord, the August Sovereign, the Heavenly Worthy, the Jade Emperor, and the August Thearch. As each is to be delivered, the heavens are strictly examined.

The East says: "If a scholar can clearly enunciate the eight-character incantation, then the Divine Lords will open the Gate of Eternal Light, and the souls of the Ten Directions will all attain deliverance, entering the Gate of Rebirth. Ascending to the Terrace of the Jade Capital, they will rejoice in the Purple Ultimate Palace. Within it, the Divine Infant sings the hymn of the Immeasurable, and immediately they regain their forms in the Chamber of Triple Refinement, their bodies receiving the spontaneous qi, rejoicing in boundless longevity."

The Recluse says: "Wherever there are those who recite and cultivate, those who are destined for deliverance are assessed according to the ledgers of the various heavens, their merits tallied and their records complete."

The Lesser Mystery says: "All are delivered according to the weight of their merits and the circumstances of their karmic conditions. The heavens are strictly examined, with nothing omitted or lost. A universal proclamation is made to the Three Realms and the Boundless Divine Regions."

The East says: "The Three Realms are the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm. The Boundless refers to the boundless worlds of the Ten Directions. A universal proclamation is made to the gods of the Ten Directions, the boundless and infinite, so that all may know and hear."

The Recluse says: "A decree is issued to the demon kings of the Three Realms and the Five Emperors, extending even to the boundless and infinite divine domains, ensuring that no hidden place remains uninformed."

The Lesser Mystery says: "This is the Jade Emperor’s proclamation. The Three Realms consist of the six heavens of the Realm of Desire, the eighteen heavens of the Realm of Form, and the four heavens of the Formless Realm. The divine regions are without limit, hence called the Boundless Divine Regions. The Subterranean Palace of the Yellow Springs and the Northern Capital of Fengdu."

The East says: "The Northern Capital is the Jade Capital."

Fengdu is the name of a mountain. The Mountain of Fengdu lies north of Heaven and Earth, beyond the Northern Sea. Its height is two thousand six hundred li, and both its interior and exterior are adorned with palaces of the seven treasures, where the gods and spirits of Heaven and Earth reside. Within it, the Six Heavens of the Three Realms and the Great Demon King of the Northern Emperor hold dominion. Each of the six palaces governs the ghosts and spirits of the Six Heavens, and within the cavern are six palaces, all mirroring one another.

The Three Lesser Water Officials of the Lower Prime condense the qi of wind and marsh, coagulating the essence of the vast and luminous, establishing the Three Offices of the Lower Prime. The first is named the Tanggu Cavern Spring Palace, also called the Qinghua Fangzhu Palace. It governs the Water Emperor, the Divine King of Tanggu, the Nine River Water Courts, the River Earls, the immortals, the perfected ones, and all the great spirits within the waters who have attained the Dao, as well as the souls of the past and those who, though yet to attain the Dao, have accrued merit, receiving deliverance and ascension. This palace comprises three bureaus: left, right, and central. The left is named the Azure Origin Numinous Abyss Bureau; the right, the Ninefold Ice Cold Night Bureau; and the central, the Solitary North Azure Numinous Bureau. They register and seal the caverns of the Nine Rivers.

The Lower Prime’s left palace is named the Qingling Palace, also called the Southern Water Assembly Palace. It governs the myriad spirits within the waters—jiao dragons, whales, and leviathans—with five hundred million each of the Water Mother and Dragon Gate, all enveloped in the qi of ten thousand layers of wind-marsh vajra. This palace also comprises three bureaus: the central is named the Numinous Treasure Kalpa Blade Bureau; the left, the Ling Kalpa Bureau; and the right, the Long Night Cold Court Bureau, which oversees the myriad spirits of the waters.

The Lower Prime’s right palace is named the Northern Fengdu Palace, also called the Fengdu Palace. It governs the accumulated souls of the dead in eternal night, condemned to penal servitude. Its left bureau is named the Liberation and Kalpa Measure Bureau; the right, the Spring Cavern Ghosts and Spirits Bureau; and the central, the Numinous Passage Great Kalpa Bureau.

The Three Lesser Water Officials of the Lower Prime oversee three palaces, each governing fourteen departments, totaling forty-two departments across the three palaces. Together, they administer the caverns of the Nine Rivers, all bearing natural designations, and command all the spirits of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine River Water Courts—both those who have attained the Dao and those who have not—as well as the perfected immortals and jade maidens of the Five Sacred Peaks upon the earth. On the days of *gengshen* in the sexagenary cycle of the Great Year, they descend to the Three Offices of Tanggu, Qingling, and Northern Fengdu to review and compile the registers of life and death of the Nine Bureaus.

In ancient times, when Heaven and Earth underwent transformation and sank into the era of Yankang, all was dark and unopened until the Flying Celestials illuminated the light. Thereupon, they scattered radiance across the heavens, receiving qi and sprinkling numinosity. The former name of the Mysterious Capital was the Jade Capital, also a title of the Great Sage. The Supreme Perfected of the Northern Emperor governs the Palace of Mysterious Numinosity, beneath which lies the Cold Ice Night Court, and further below, the realm of the Eight Difficulties. Thus, it is called the Spring Cavern Palace.

The Recluse says: "The Spring Cavern Palace is the ghostly court of the Ninefold Dark and Eternal Night, while the Northern Capital of Fengdu is Fengdu, the ghostly capital of the Northern Emperor. Fengdu is the mountain of the Ninefold Dark in the Northern Sea, named the Ghost Capital, situated atop the dark mountain of Fengdu."

The Lesser Mystery says: "This is the right palace of the Lower Prime. According to the *True Instructions*, the Northern Fengdu lies in the outer *gui* region north of Heaven and Earth, also named the Fengdu Spring Cavern Palace, the right bureau of Fengdu. Fengdu is the name of the mountain in the Northern Capital, towering two thousand six hundred li in height, with a circumference of thirty thousand li. Beneath it lies a cavern-heaven with a circumference of fifteen thousand li. Both its interior and exterior are adorned with palaces of the seven treasures. There are the Upper, Middle, and Lower Offices, each with eight prisons, totaling twenty-four prisons, all dwelling places of the gods and spirits of Heaven and Earth. The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus correspond to the Twelve River Sources."

The East says: "The Three Offices are the Offices of Heaven, Earth, and Water. The Upper Prime’s Celestial Office comprises three offices, each governing twelve departments, totaling thirty-six departments. The Middle Prime’s Terrestrial Office also comprises three offices, each governing fourteen departments, totaling forty-two departments. The Lower Prime’s Water Office likewise comprises three palaces, each governing fourteen departments, totaling forty-two departments. Together, the Three Offices comprise one hundred twenty departments, overseeing ghosts, spirits, and humans. The Offices of Heaven, Earth, and Water form the Nine Bureaus. Within the Nine Seas, Three Rivers, and Twelve River Sources, the registers of life and death are boundless and fathomless. All the infinite immortals and spirits are universally proclaimed."

The Recluse says: "The Three Offices are the Three Offices of Fengdu. Fengdu has six palaces, with two palaces constituting one office, hence six palaces form three offices. Each office has three bureaus, so three offices have nine bureaus. The left is the Fire Office, the right the Water Office, and the central the Female Office, each following the source of affairs, overseeing examinations and punishments, akin to the Six Ministries of the mundane world. The Twelve River Sources are the Water Courts, their affairs corresponding to the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus. The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus also number twelve, and since they belong to the north, which is a yin position, the number twelve is adopted to establish the twelve offices. This merely designates the principal authorities; lesser positions are not mentioned."

The Lesser Mystery says: "The Three Offices are the Upper Prime’s Celestial Office, the Middle Prime’s Terrestrial Office, and the Lower Prime’s Water Office. They govern the Nine Bureaus, the administrative bureaus of the Nine Courts. The Twelve River Sources refer to the moon as the essence of the Great Yin and the mother of all waters. The Well is the source of the Celestial River and the fountainhead of all waters. Each month, the moon completes a circuit of the heavens, and each year, twelve months pass, with the moon traversing the Eastern Well each month, irrigating the blossoms of the Yellow Waters and bathing the countenances

According to the *Scripture of the Three Primes’ Precepts and Commandments*, the Upper Prime’s Celestial Office is subordinate to the Jade Clarity Realm, where the qi of blue, yellow, and white coalesce to establish the Three Offices of the Upper Prime. The Mysterious Qi forms the Central Palace; the Primordial Qi, the Left Palace; and the Original Qi, the Right Palace. The Central Palace is named the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Seven Treasures of Primordial Yang, where the qi of the Blue Primordial and Primal Yang coalesce. It presides over the Supreme Thearch of the Jade Void of the Upper Realized Ones, the Thearchs of the Myriad Heavens, and the Great Spirits of the Upper Sages. Its offices number fifty-five myriad, five thousand five hundred fifty-five myriad myriad layers, and among its divine and immortal officials, there are likewise fifty-five myriad, five thousand five hundred fifty-five myriad myriad beings, all coalesced from the natural Blue Primordial Qi to form humans. Their robes are feathered flying garments of blue. Within the Purple Tenuity Palace resides the Talisman of Prolonged Life; when this talisman is issued to the eight directions, the qi of the eight directions responds with immediate resonance, and all instantly become human. When the talisman is concealed, they revert to qi. The palace establishes three bureaus—left, right, and central. The Left Bureau governs the Office of Life, overseen by the Fire Official of Grand Yang; the Right Bureau governs the Office of Death, overseen by the Water Official of Grand Yin; and the Central Bureau governs both life and death, examining transgressions and blessings with the Wind Blade. The term "examine" means to verify matters: great blessings are reviewed every three years, middling blessings every nine years, and minor blessings every twenty-four years. Each of the three bureaus commands ninety million officials, collectively overseeing the twelve departments of life, death, transgressions, and blessings.

The Left Palace is named the Palace of the Great Mysterious Primordial Yellow and Supreme Ultimate of the Left, also known as the Left Ministerial Palace of Jade Clarity. It coalesces from the Primordial Yellow Qi and presides over the thousand perfected ones who have attained the Dao, as well as the registers of male and female lives. Its palace numbers and officials do not differ from the Central Palace; they, too, coalesce from the natural Primordial Yellow Qi to form humans, and their robes are feathered flying garments of yellow. Within the Supreme Ultimate Palace of the Left resides the Talisman of Summoning Spirits, used in the same manner as the Talisman of Prolonged Life. The Left Palace also establishes three bureaus, which examine transgressions and blessings in the same manner as the Central Palace.

The Right Palace is also named the Palace of the Great Mysterious Cavern White and Supreme Ultimate of the Right, which is the Palace of Pure Tenuity. It coalesces from the Cavern White Qi of the Celestial Primordial and presides over the Upper Realized Ones who have attained the Dao, as well as the registers of the common people—both male and female—who have not yet attained the Dao, along with their records of transgressions. Its palace numbers and officials likewise do not differ from the Central Palace. Its inhabitants coalesce from the natural Cavern White Qi to form humans, and their robes are feathered flying garments of white. Within the palace resides the Talisman of Illuminating the Realized, used in the same manner as the Talismans of Prolonged Life and Summoning Spirits. The three bureaus—left, right, and central—examine transgressions and blessings in the same manner as the Central Palace.

The Three Palaces of the Upper Prime each govern three bureaus, and each bureau governs four departments, so that the nine bureaus collectively oversee thirty-six departments. Those who have accumulated sufficient merit and virtue and are destined for immortality are recorded in the Purple Tenuity Palace; those who revere and uphold the Great Dao are recorded in the Supreme Ultimate Palace of the Left; and those destined for death are recorded in the Right Palace.

The Terrestrial Office of the Middle Prime’s second rank is subordinate to the Supreme Clarity Realm, coalescing from the Cavernous Mixed Spirit Qi and condensing the essence of the Ultimate Yellow. Its Central Palace is named the Palace of Cavernous Spirit and Pure Tenuity, presiding over the Five Thearchs, the Five Marchmounts, and all the perfected terrestrial immortals who have attained the Dao. Its palaces number fifty-five myriad, five thousand five hundred fifty-five myriad myriad layers, and among its divine and immortal officials, there are ninety-nine myriad, nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine myriad beings. These are the souls of the deceased who possessed merit and virtue, not coalesced from natural qi. Having received deliverance, they assume the duties of the Terrestrial Office of Immortals, each with a fixed term. When their merit is complete and their virtue advanced, they ascend to become officials of the Celestial Bureaus; those whose merit is incomplete return to be reborn among humans.

The Central Palace establishes three bureaus—left, right, and central. The Left Bureau is named the Bureau of Enduring Transgressions and Bright Dawn; the Right Bureau, the Bureau of Yin’s Termination and Heaven’s Severance; and the Central Bureau, the Bureau of the Seven Wrongs and Tranquil Illumination. They examine transgressions, blessings, yin and yang, and the reckoning of years in the same manner as the Upper Prime. The Left Palace is named the Palace of the Southern Culmen and Cavernous Yang, presiding over the Nine Earths’ Earthly Thearchs, the myriad spirit officials of the Eight Poles, and the registers of lives. Its palace numbers and officials do not differ from the Palace of Pure Tenuity. The palace establishes three bureaus: the Left Bureau is named the Bureau of the Winding Dark Springs; the Right Bureau, the Bureau of the Great Execution of the Nine Netherworlds; and the Central Bureau, the Bureau of the Punitive Qi of the Salty Pond. They examine transgressions and blessings, and the reckoning of years does not differ from the Left Palace. The three palaces and three bureaus of the Middle Prime collectively oversee fourteen departments, and the nine bureaus together govern forty-two departments. They all reside within the caverns of mountains, where they memorialize good and evil in the same manner as the Upper Prime.

The Water Office of the Lower Prime’s third rank is subordinate to the Grand Clarity Realm, coalescing from the qi of wind and marsh and condensing the essence of the Vast Dawn. Its Central Palace is named the Palace of the Scalding Valley and Cavernous Springs, also called the Palace of Azure Florescence and the Square Cauldron. It presides over the Divine Kings of the Scalding Valley, the Water Bureaus of the Nine Rivers, the River Earls, the water immortals, and the great spirits of the waters, as well as the registers and records of immortals. Its palace numbers and officials are the same as those of the Middle Prime. Its officials are also filled by souls possessing merit and virtue. The palace establishes three bureaus: the Left Bureau is named the Bureau of the Azure Primordial and Numinous Springs; the Right Bureau, the Bureau of the Nine Springs and Frigid Night; and the Central Bureau, the Bureau of the Northern Solitude and Azure Numinosity. They examine the reckoning of years, transgressions, and blessings in the same manner as the Middle Prime.

The Left Palace is named the Palace of Pure Numinosity, presiding over the myriad essences of the waters, the jiao dragons, whales, and salamanders, as well as the assembly of the Water Mother and Dragon Gate, the cycles of deliverance, and the registers of human lives, deaths, merits, and transgressions. Its qi is the adamantine qi of wind and marsh, and its palace numbers and officials do not differ from the Central Palace. The Right Palace establishes three bureaus: the Left Bureau is named the Bureau of the Numinous Kalpa; the Right Bureau, the Bureau of the Long Night; and the Central Bureau, the Bureau of the Numinous Treasure and Kalpa Blade. They examine transgressions and blessings in the same manner as the Central Palace. It collectively presides over the essence-souls of the waters, the hundred ghosts, and the myriad spirits, all coalesced from the qi of the wind-marsh’s Brahman conduct. Its palace numbers and officials are also the same as those of the Middle Prime.

The Right Palace is named the Fengdu Palace, establishing three bureaus: the Left Bureau is named the Bureau of Opening Deliverance and Kalpa Measure; the Central Bureau, the Bureau of Communicating with Spirits and the Great Kalpa; and the Right Bureau, the Bureau of the Winding Springs and Ghostly Spirits. They examine transgressions and blessings in the same manner as the Middle Prime.

The Lower Prime comprises three palaces, each governing three bureaus; the nine bureaus together oversee forty-two departments, with each set of three bureaus jointly administering fourteen departments and nine chambers. They collectively govern the Water Emperors and Divine Kings of the Eight Seas and Four Watercourses, as well as all numinous spirits within the waters. The Three Primes in total comprise nine palaces, twenty-seven bureaus, and one hundred twenty departments.

The Left governs matters of life, the Right governs matters of death. Meritorious deeds are recorded in the green registers of the Left Bureau, while transgressions are inscribed in the black registers of the Right Bureau. If transgressions are intermingled with blessings, or blessings with transgressions, they are not assigned to a single department.

Those who attain the Dao are reported to the Central Palace; those with merit are memorialized to the Left Palace; those with transgressions are memorialized to the Right Palace. On each of the Three Primes and Eight Festivals, the roots of evil are severed.

**Xuan Ying states:** This elucidates the matter of refining and delivering deceased souls with the Yellow Waters and Moon Essence. The "twelve" refers to the twelve months of the year. The "River Source" is the Celestial River. The heavens possess the Twenty-Eight Constellations, and the Well Star of the Eastern Quadrant is the source of the Celestial River, the fountainhead of all waters. The Moon is the essence of the Great Yin and the mother of all waters. As the Moon traverses the heavens each month, it passes through the Well Star, exhaling water to irrigate the earth—hence the term "Twelve River Sources." When deceased souls receive rebirth, they are all refined by the Yellow Waters to become perfected immortals. This passage expounds on the deliverance of deceased souls, thus invoking the Twelve River Sources to clarify the matter. Moreover, the Three Primes and Eight Festivals serve as exhortations for cultivation. Should practitioners attain swift ascent, they may also deliver their ancestors, as referred to in the following text:

*Liberating ancestors and progenitors, kin of kalpas innumerable.*

**Youxi states:** This means freeing the imprisoned souls of ancestral generations and pardoning the karmic bonds of clan relatives across countless kalpas.

**Shaowei states:** Whenever the Three Officials conduct their reviews, if descendants have accrued great merit, the Jade Emperor will immediately grant liberation to their ancestors, progenitors, and all clan relatives across kalpas, delivering them to be reborn in the heavens.

*Swiftly erasing the ledgers of transgression, severing the roots of evil.*

**Dong states:** *Ji* means swift; *bu* means record. To swiftly expunge the records of transgression and sever the roots of evil.

**Youxi states:** To swiftly erase the black ledgers of karmic retribution and promptly uproot the deep-seated causes of malevolent consequences.

*No longer detained, nor forced to mingle with ghostly multitudes.*

**Dong states:** *Ju* means to confine; *bi* means to compel. No longer confined or bound, nor forcibly gathered within the courts of ghosts, obstructing the true teaching.

**Youxi states:** Having relied on the merit of scriptural recitation for deliverance and bathed in the grace of the Dao for liberation, how could there remain any hardship of confinement or stagnation, or mingling among the throngs of ghosts?

**Shaowei states:** By the edict of the Three Officials, those with merit shall not be detained or compelled to mingle with ghostly multitudes.

*By the talismanic command of the Primordial Beginning, they ascend in due time. In the Frigid Pool of the Northern Capital, their forms and souls are marshaled and guarded.*

**Dong states:** When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the scriptures, He issued a command summoning the officials of the Nine Bureaus from the hells of the ten directions and boundless worlds, from the darkest hour of the night, and from the icy courts of the Northern Capital. In an instant, each marshaled their ghostly legions to escort the delivered souls forth from the Palace of Eternal Night, allowing them all to behold the light.

**Youxi states:** By the talismanic decree of the Primordial Beginning, they ascend in the daylight hours. The Northern Emperor instructs the souls of the Frigid Pool—those who received form—to be marshaled forth from the Bureau of Winding Springs. The Frigid Pool is the pool of punishment.

**Shaowei states:** Beneath Fengdu lies the Frigid Pool. Should any ghost or spirit grow lax, the Jade Emperor issues a talismanic command, and in an instant, the icy courts of the night, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, each marshal the imprisoned souls to be moved from the Palace of Eternal Night, all receiving deliverance and beholding the light.

*Subduing demons and safeguarding promotion, they are delivered to the Southern Palace by rank.* **Dong states:** The demon kings of the Three Realms constantly compose deceptive songs to disturb the minds of cultivators.

The steadfast of heart—these the demon kings escort directly to ascend within the Yellow Reed Heavens, where they proceed to Golden Flower Mountain to receive the token of the Great One, thereby subduing the trials of the great demons; only then are they delivered. At that moment, talismans restrain the demon kings, commanding them to safeguard the promotion to the Southern Palace.

**Youqi states:** Once the Northern Emperor is commanded to release the ghostly souls from the Northern Bureau, the demon kings are then restrained to promote the immortal ranks to the Southern Palace. The dead souls undergo refinement, and the immortals are transformed into human form.

**Dong states:** The Southern Palace is the Palace of Longevity. The Lord of Deliverance governs within it, named Xu Yuan, who is admitted into the Southern Palace. Xu Yuan refines the decayed bones, while the Vital Youths irrigate them with the essence of life, inscribing the contract of existence upon the Four Poles and bestowing the natural Feathered Youths. The Vital Youths are the numinous youths of the sun’s midst.

**Youqi states:** When the dead souls are promoted within the Southern Palace, their ghostly substance is refined with the unguent of flowing fire, and from this transformation, they attain immortality. The living form receives deliverance, enduring for kalpas without end.

**Dong states:** The living form refers to the soul that, having undergone refinement and deliverance, regains human existence. When the Primordial Beginning initiates transformation, the body ascends to the Palace of Longevity, enduring for countless kalpas. Revolving through kalpas, it shares the age of Heaven.

**Youqi states:** If in this very life one receives ascension and deliverance, one’s years equal those of Heaven, and one’s form merges with the Dao, enduring from the beginning to the end of kalpas, from kalpa to kalpa, while kalpas themselves rise and fall, yet one alone remains. When the world of Heaven and Earth completes one cycle of its destiny, this is called a kalpa.

**Xuanying states:** "Revolving through kalpas" refers to kalpas of varying magnitudes. When a great kalpa reaches its cycle, it is the time when Heaven and Earth decay and the kalpic fire arises. A lesser kalpa marks the completion of one cycle of human birth and death, termed a kalpa. "Revolving through kalpas" means that the dead souls, refined and transformed into human form, cannot escape death; after death, they are reborn as humans, thus revolving through kalpas. Kalpa after kalpa, they are reborn in the human realm, hence it is said they share the age of Heaven. They forever transcend the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Difficulties.

**Dong states:** "Forever" means eternally. The Three Paths are the names of the three evil gates. The first is the Gate of Sensual Desire, also called the Upper Corpse Path or the Heavenly Path Realm. The second is the Gate of Attachment, also called the Middle Corpse Path or the Human Path Realm. The third is the Gate of Greed, also called the Lower Corpse Path or the Earthly Path Realm. These are the Three Evil Gates, also termed the Three Corpse Paths or the Three Path Realms, which constantly dwell within the human body, blocking the three passes of the body, severing the three roots of life, obstructing the path to immortal learning, and suppressing the soul’s ascent.

The Five Sufferings are also called the Five Path Gates. The first is the Gate of Sensual Affliction, also called the Hell of Mount Tai; the second is the Gate of Attachment’s Affliction, also called the Path of Wind and Blades; the third is the Gate of Greed’s Affliction, also called the Path of Carrying Stones and Mountains; the fourth is the Gate of Vanity’s Affliction, also called the Path of Filling the Sea to Make Rivers; the fifth is the Gate of Bodily Affliction, also called the Path of Swallowing Fire and Eating Coals in Cauldrons of Boiling Water. Thus, the scripture says: "The reason I have great suffering is because I have a body; if I had no body, what suffering would I have?" These Five Sufferings and Five Paths constantly reside within the human body, binding the root of life, obstructing the path to summoning the true, and severing the gate to immortal cultivation. The Three Paths and Five Sufferings together form the Eight Difficulties, the root of transgression. Without dissolving one’s form above the Five Paths and erasing one’s traces beneath the Five Sufferings, the myriad afflictions remain unsevered, and one sinks into the fields of transgression. Those who study the supreme Ways must first sever all afflictions, extinguish the paths of suffering, so that true qi naturally descends, and immortality naturally manifests. Only then can one transform one’s form, wander through the Three Clarities, enter the Palace of Longevity, and be forever free from the Eight Difficulties.

They transcend and rise above the Three Realms, roaming carefree in the Upper Clarity.

**Dong states:** "Transcend" means to ascend; "rise" means to soar high. Upon ascending to the Southern Palace, the Divine King commands the Feathered Forest Inspector to review the Register of the Living, receive the talisman, and ascend as an immortal, roaming amidst the Cloud Palaces, clad in garments woven of clouds, proceeding directly to the Vermilion Mound Palace to receive blessings in the Heavenly Hall, merging with the Flying Celestials in radiance, soaring through the clouds. The Divine King is the Wondrously Accomplished Heavenly King, named Yu Sheng, who governs the Flying Celestial deities of the ten directions. The Feathered Forest Inspector, named Miao Xue, knows the celestial sounds of Heaven, and is called the Earth’s Only One in the Three Realms. He attends to the luminous spirits and ghosts, naturally perceiving all, flying through the Three Realms, and roaming in the Upper Clarity.

**Youqi states:** Having equaled the years of Heaven and merged form with the Dao, one forever escapes the servitude of the Three Paths and the exile of the Five Sufferings; one transcends the Eight Difficulties in the demonic realms and ascends to the true domain of the Nine Heavens. The Three Paths are: first, the Path of Eternal Night; second, the Path of the Frigid Pool; third, the Path of Carrying Stones. The Five Sufferings are: first, the Suffering of Knife Mountains; second, the Suffering of Sword Trees; third, the Suffering of Cauldrons of Boiling Water; fourth, the Suffering of Furnace Coals; fifth, the Suffering of Interrogation and Exile. The Eight Difficulties comprise the Three Paths and Five Sufferings.

**Shaowei states:** The Three Paths are the servitudes of the Three Officials. The first is the servitude of the Heavenly Official, racing thunder and lightning; the second is the servitude of the Earthly Official, carrying mountains and stones; the third is the servitude of the Water Official, hauling and drawing from the dark seas. The Five Sufferings are: climbing knife mountains, treading sword trees, entering cauldrons of boiling water, embracing bronze pillars, and swallowing fire and eating coals. The Eight Difficulties are the eight gates of profound and desolate hardship, which the Dao Lord inquired about and the Flying Celestials answered. The Heaven of Upper Clarity is where the Heavenly Emperor and Jade Perfected dwell, in the colorless radiance of ascetic practice.

**Dong states:** In the Heaven of Upper Clarity, there resides the Heavenly Emperor Jade Perfected, whose name is Tuoyu. The Five Chapters of True Writ, bound with luminous qi, dwell upon the Cloud Alas Ridge, known as the Heaven of Wondrous Completion.

The Jade Perfected in the Heaven of Upper Clarity does not partake in the realm of form, riding the great qi of Brahman to roam and enter the Heaven of Supreme Yellow Emperor Zeng.

**Youxi remarks:** In the Heaven of Upper Clarity, the Heavenly Emperor occupies the most exalted position among the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors, his Dao equal to that of the Primordial Beginning, his rank aligned with the Jade Clarity. Thus he is called Jade Perfected, and this is the Upper Clarity. Below this lie four realms, each containing nine heavens, four nines combining to form thirty-six heavens—distinct from the thirty-two heavens. The formless heavens possess radiance without color, hence termed "Brahmanic practice." Following this are the heavens of the four subsequent directions, each direction comprising eight heavens, four eights combining to form thirty-two heavens, called the Four Brahman Heavens. *Jing* refers to the body; *se* refers to substance. Speaking of the thirty-two heavens, the Supreme Thearchs, though lofty and revered in form, possess radiance without substance. Though they bear true appearances, they move through the void without obstruction, unobstructed by things, hence termed "Brahmanic practice." Brahman is the Dao within the Dao. These Three Clarities, five realms, and thirty-six heavens are called the Great Luo of the Four Directions. Within the Four Brahman and thirty-two heavens, the Four Heavens of Seed People are called the Middle Luo. The three realms of desire, form, and formlessness, comprising twenty-eight heavens, are called the Lesser Luo.

**Shaowei states:** The Heavenly Emperor of Upper Clarity is named Jade Perfected, styled Tuoyu, and titled the Purple Dawn Heavenly Thearch. He does not partake in the realm of form, possessing no Three Radiance, hence called "radiance without color." Only the great qi of Brahman flows and blends, mapping the heavens in clouds. Each heaven possesses its own sun and moon. From Upper Clarity to the Great Luo, nine-colored luminosity arises spontaneously, independent of sun and moon, thus termed "radiance without color in Brahmanic practice."

In the Heaven of Supreme Yellow Emperor Zeng, the Emperor is Yulan Yuming.

**Dong states:** The first heaven of the East belongs to the Heaven of Pure Tenuity, where the Emperor’s position is the Black of Primordial Yang.

**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is yellow in color, its qi linked to the Brahman qi of the northwest. The Emperor’s taboo name is Guanjue, overseeing the Register of Life. The people of this heaven live for nine million years, their six roots all tainted—this is called the Realm of Desire.

**Xuanying states:** Whenever Brahman qi is mentioned, it refers to the heavens of the four corners. *Wei* means "corner." The heavens of the four cardinal directions are named after the qi of the twenty-eight constellations; the heavens of the four corners do not belong to the cardinal constellations but borrow the qi of the adjacent constellations to form, hence termed Brahman qi. Brahman is a name denoting mixture and lack of fixed attachment. For example, the Heaven of Emperor Zeng draws upon the qi of the Kui and Bi constellations, hence called Brahman qi. The three heavens below follow this pattern. Among the thirty-two heavens, the lifespans of heavenly beings increase by onefold with each ascent from this heaven upward—this pattern is self-evident. Furthermore, in the scriptures of the thirty-two heavens from Emperor Zeng downward, the text preceding "heaven" denotes the name of the heaven, while the text following "Emperor" denotes the title of the Heavenly Emperor.

In the Heaven of Great Brilliance and Jade Perfection, the Emperor is Xu’anatian.

**Dong states:** The second heaven of the East belongs to the Heaven of Yu Remnant, where the Emperor’s position is the qi of Upper Yang.

**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is green in color, its qi linked to the Bi constellation of the north. The Emperor’s taboo name is Lanjue, overseeing the rebirth of souls. The people of this heaven live for eighteen million years, one desire-root roughly purified, five desire-roots roughly tainted.

In the Heaven of Luminous Clarity and Harmonious Youth, the Emperor is Yuanyu Qijing.

**Dong states:** The third heaven of the East belongs to the Heaven of Great Red, where the Emperor’s position is the qi of Great Yang.

**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is black in color, its qi linked to the Shi constellation of the north. The Emperor’s taboo name is Dajue, overseeing the propagation of governance and teachings, liberating heavenly beings. The people of this heaven live for thirty-six million years, two desire-roots roughly purified, four desire-roots roughly tainted.

In the Heaven of Mysterious Womb and Peaceful Nurturance, the Emperor is Liu Dunneixian.

**Dong states:** The fourth heaven of the East belongs to the Heaven of Primordial Radiance, where the Emperor’s position is the First Clear Yang of the Nine Heavens.

**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is red in color, its qi linked to the Wei constellation of the north. The Emperor’s taboo name is Yuwang, overseeing the summoning of demons and elevation of immortals. The people of this heaven live for seventy-two million years, three desire-roots roughly purified, three desire-roots roughly tainted.

In the Heaven of Primordial Brilliance and Literary Elevation, the Emperor is Chou Falun.

**Dong states:** The fifth heaven of the East belongs to the Heaven of Immeasurable Longevity, where the Emperor’s position is the Second Cavernous Yang of the Nine Heavens.

**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is blue-green in color, its qi linked to the Xu constellation of the north. The Emperor’s taboo name is Fanyun, overseeing the circulation of primordial qi. The people of this heaven live for one hundred forty-four million years, four desire-roots roughly purified, two desire-roots roughly tainted.

In the Heaven of Upper Brilliance and Seven Luminaries’ Ma Yi, the Emperor is Tian Huaiyan.

**Dong states:** The sixth heaven of the East belongs to the Heaven of Upper Surveillance, where the Emperor’s position is the qi of Pervading Yang.

**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is black in color, its qi linked to the Xunü constellation of the north. The Emperor’s taboo name is Yuzhen, overseeing the liberation of those in profound difficulty. The people of this heaven live for two hundred eighty-eight million years, five desire-roots roughly purified, one desire-root roughly tainted.

The above six heavens are called the Realm of Desire. The *Canons of the Supreme Perfected* state: In the first two heavens below, karmic retribution remains coarse, and desire is still expressed through bodily union; in the next two heavens, desire is expressed through holding hands; in the fifth heaven, through speech; and in the sixth heaven, through gaze. Now, due to the six desires, these six heavens are thus manifested. With one desire-root roughly purified, one ascends to the next heaven; when all six desires are wholly purified, one transcends the Realm of Desire and ascends to the Realm of Form.

**Zongjun states:** To speak of the Realm of Desire is to speak of beings with form and desire, who engage in the union of yin and yang, and are born of wombs—hence it is called the Realm of Desire.

The Void-Transcending Balance Heaven, where the Emperor governs the Radiance of True Stability.
**Dong states:** The seventh heaven of the East, belonging to the Tuṣita Heaven, where the Emperor’s throne is established by the qi of yang.
**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is jade-green in hue, its qi linked to the Northern Dipper constellation. The Emperor’s name is "Supreme None," and he presides over the illumination of the supreme Dao. Beings here live for 576 million years, their six sensory dusts still tainted—having just emerged from the Realm of Desire, they remain stained by the dusts of form.

The Primordial Obscurity Veiling Heaven, where the Emperor nurtures the Nine Prosperities.
**Dong states:** The eighth heaven of the East, belonging to the Heaven of Joy Without Arrogance, where the Emperor’s throne is established by the qi of extreme yang.
**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is purple in hue, its qi linked to the Dipper constellation of the North.

Beings here live for 1,152 million years, with one sensory dust roughly purified and five still tainted.

The Vermilion Brilliance Harmonizing Yang Heaven, where the Emperor governs the Forbidden Realms of the Supreme Perfected.
**Dong states:** The first heaven of the South, belonging to the Heaven of Responsive Transformation, where the Emperor’s throne is established by the qi of incipient yang.
**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is white in hue, its qi linked to the northeast’s Brahmanic qi, situated between the Winnowing Basket and Dipper constellations. The Emperor’s name is Huan Ming, and he governs the refinement of immortals into perfected beings. Beings here live for 23,040 million years, with two sensory dusts roughly purified and four still tainted.

The Mystic Brilliance Reverent Splendor Heaven, where the Emperor chants the Hymns of Obscure Sound.
**Dong states:** The second heaven of the South, belonging to the Heaven of Brahmā’s Treasure, where the Emperor’s throne is established by the qi of yang’s radiance.
**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is yellow in hue, its qi linked to the Winnowing Basket constellation of the East. The Emperor’s name is Shiyuan, and he responds to and transforms all things.

**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is blue-green in hue, its qi linked to the Heart constellation of the East. The Emperor’s name is Shao, and he tests those who study immortality through demonic trials. Beings here live for 18,432 million years, with five sensory dusts roughly purified and one still tainted.
**Xuanying states:** These preceding six heavens are the heavens of sensory dusts. If a practitioner cultivates to the utmost in these heavens, all sensory dusts are exhausted, and they ascend to the heavens of subtle dusts, as described below.

The inhabitants of this heaven live for 7,549,747,200,000,000 years, with five light dusts purified and one light dust tainted.
The above eighteen heavens are called the **Form Realm**.
**The Great Perfected Regulations** states: Within the Formless Realm, the utmost perfected are without attachment, do not engage in yin and yang, and their people are born through transformation. They only consume fragrant qi and are no longer troubled by form and substance.
**Xuanying states:** These preceding eighteen heavens are collectively called the Form Realm. Ascending beyond this heaven, one reaches the Formless Realm, where form and appearance are entirely absent, and one may attain the same lifespan as the inhabitants of that realm. The preceding discussion of the Form Realm heavens shows that even light dusts remain as encumbrances. Here, in the Formless Realm, form and appearance are entirely absent. When a practitioner cultivates to this heaven, only the mind and consciousness remain, entering into qi observation.

**Luminous Court Cloud Crossing Heaven**, where the Emperor is named Hui Jue Hun.
**Dong states:** The first heaven of the North, belonging to the Adahe Heaven, where the Emperor’s throne is established by the qi of yin generation.
**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is jade-green in hue, its qi linked to the southwest’s Dao qi, situated between the Shen and Jing constellations. The Emperor’s name is Yu, and he governs the deliverance of cultivators.

The inhabitants of this heaven live for 15,099,494,400,000,000 years, with all dusts of form purified, and their forms and appearances become as empty space. Only the mind and consciousness remain, entering into qi observation. When qi observation and the Dao are accomplished, one ascends to the **Primordial Cavern Heaven**.

**Abyssal Primordial Cavern Heaven**, where the Emperor is named Fan Xing Guan Sheng.
**Dong states:** The second heaven of the North, belonging to the Shan Ming Min Heaven, where the Emperor’s throne is established by the qi of yin transformation.

The inhabitants of this heaven live for 30,198,988,800,000,000 years. Though the mind and consciousness still labor, one may relinquish the mind and consciousness to cultivate, thereby attaining birth in the **Wondrous Accomplishment Heaven**.
**Xuanying states:** The mind and consciousness are still considered a hindrance. If one can relinquish the mind and consciousness to attain non-action, one may ascend to the Wondrous Accomplishment Heaven.

**Great Literary Flourishing Wondrous Accomplishment Heaven**, where the Emperor is named Nayuchou Ying.
**Dong states:** The third heaven of the North, belonging to the Liye Heaven, where the Emperor’s throne is established by the qi of luminous yin.
**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is white in hue, its qi linked to the Zi constellation of the West. The Emperor’s name is Tuo, and he governs the governance of spirit kings.

The inhabitants of this heaven live for 60,397,977,600,000,000 years. All former causes are forgotten, and the mind and consciousness reside in this heaven. This heaven does not require complete forgetting; thus, when needed, they are present, and when not, they are absent. In this state of being as if present and as if absent, one ascends to the **Forbidden Upper Heaven**.
**Xuanying states:** This heaven does not require complete forgetting. If emptiness and existence were both absent, the true response within the real would be lost. Within emptiness, there is the real; within the real, there is response. The myriad phenomena arise from emptiness; the myriad dharmas reside in the mind, yet without form or appearance. When applied, they exist; when existing, they are not non-existent. Guiding practitioners to observe the mind as if present and as if absent, one is born into the Forbidden Upper Heaven.

**Great Primordial Elegant Joy Forbidden Upper Heaven**, where the Emperor is named Long Luo Jue Chang.
**Dong states:** The fourth heaven of the North, belonging to the Ming Fan Kuo Da Zhao Heaven, where the Emperor’s throne is established by the qi of penetrating yin.
**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is yellow in hue, its qi linked to the Bi constellation of the West. The Emperor’s name is Wei, and he governs the recording of demon kings.

The inhabitants of this heaven live for 1,207,959,552,000,000 years. Qi observation becomes increasingly wondrous, and all habitual tendencies are forgotten. If one thoroughly enters into spontaneity, one ascends to reside in the **Seed People Heaven**.

The above four heavens are called the Formless Realm. *The Great Perfection Regulations* states: In the Formless Realm, human bodies are subtle and wondrous, no longer possessing form or color. Some may grow hundreds of *zhang* in height yet remain unseen by ordinary people—only perfected beings can perceive them. Since no visible form exists, it is called the Formless Realm. However, beings within the Three Realms have not severed the root of birth and death, and the qi of yin and yang still lingers, thus their lifespans remain finite. Some ascend to higher realms, while others descend into the human world, endlessly revolving according to the depth of their merit until they attain the Dao.

**Xuan Ying remarks:** These four heavens constitute the Formless Realm. If cultivators reach this realm and continue their practice, they may be reborn into the Four Seed People Heavens.

**Great Void Supreme Constant Fusion Heaven**, where the Emperor oversees the supervision of ghosts and spirits.
**Dong states:** The fifth heaven of the North, belonging to the Anigou Heaven, where the Emperor’s throne is established by the qi of numinous yin.
**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is green in hue, its qi linked to the Yi constellation of the West. The Emperor’s name is Ji, and he governs the assessment of cultivators’ merits. The inhabitants of this heaven live for 2,415,919,104,000,000 years. Having just emerged from the Three Realms, they are pure and unstained, delighting in effortless non-action.

**Great Release Jade Ascension Soaring Victory Heaven**, where the Emperor is named Miao Miao Xing Yuan.
**Dong states:** The sixth heaven of the North, belonging to the Xuda Heaven, where the Emperor’s throne is established by the qi of ethereal yin.
**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is blue-green in hue, its qi linked to the Wei constellation of the West. The Emperor’s name is Fu Li, and he governs the summoning of immortals and sages. The inhabitants of this heaven live for 4,831,838,208,000,000 years.

**Dong states:** The seventh heaven of the North, belonging to the Yuanfan Xudai Taihun Heaven, where the Emperor’s throne is established by the qi of congealed yin.

The inhabitants of this heaven live for 9,663,676,416,000,000 years, ascending and descending with the qi, free from all habitual tendencies.

**Great Ultimate Nurturing Jia Yi Heaven**, where the Emperor is named Da Ze Fa Men.
**Dong states:** The eighth heaven of the North, belonging to the Shichan Ziran Heaven, where the Emperor’s throne is established by the qi of ultimate yin.
**Shaowei remarks:** This heaven is dark green in hue, its qi linked to the Kui constellation of the West. The Emperor’s name is Jing Shang, and he governs the deliverance of cultivators’ bodies. The inhabitants of this heaven live for 19,327,352,832,000,000 years.

The above four heavens are the Four Seed People Heavens, also called the Seed People Heavens. Some say the inhabitants of these four heavens exist beyond the dual qi of yin and yang, unbound by lifespan limits, delighting in purity and tranquility. *The Sutra of Original Boundary* states: "When habitual tendencies are exhausted, one transcends the rank of the Seed People." Here, "entanglements" refer to afflictions, and "habits" to learned practices. *The Great Perfection Regulations* states: "Ascending to these four heavens, one thoroughly enters the realm of the Dao, rising and falling with the qi, beyond the reach of calamity."

The thirty-two qi, their corresponding constellations, the Emperors’ names, and their governance are all recorded in *The Scripture of Cavernous Spirit*. The lifespans of the inhabitants and the purity or defilement of their roots and senses are found in *The Scripture of the Dragon’s Stride*.

Thirty-two heavens, thirty-two Emperors.
**Dong states:** Four times eight makes thirty-two heavens. Their names and taboo titles are often similar, difficult to interpret in Sanskrit, with separate oral instructions. Each of the thirty-two heavens has its own Emperor, totaling thirty-two Emperors. The taboo titles and hidden names of the heavens—
**Dong states:** What is spoken of in the scriptures are the hidden names and taboo titles of the heavens.
**Youxi remarks:** These heavens of the four directions are: the Nine Qi Blue Heaven of the East, the Three Qi Boat Heaven of the South, the Seven Qi White Heaven of the West, and the Five Qi Mysterious Heaven of the North. Each direction has eight heavens, making four times eight, thirty-two heavens. They reside above the Three Luminaries and below the Nine Palaces. The four cardinal directions, four corners, above and below together form the Ten Directions. Since the names of the heavens and the titles of the Emperors are termed "hidden names" and "taboo titles," they cannot be annotated.

Within the heavens, the numinous chapters arise spontaneously in the void.
**Dong states:** "Void" means profound; "cavernous" means empty. "Numinous chapters" are jade scripts. Within the profound emptiness exist spontaneous jade scripts, hence called "numinous chapters."
**Youxi remarks:** This scripture is the true word of the Great Ultimate’s emptiness and cavernousness, the numinous mystery of spontaneity and non-being.
**Shaowei remarks:** The "cavernous numinous chapters" are the Eightfold Convergence of Numinous Writings, the spontaneous jade scripts. In their origin, they coalesce from the qi of emptiness and cavernousness, forming spontaneously—not the language of the mundane world, but the tonal rhythms of the heavens.
**Xuan Ying remarks:** "Cavernous" refers to the vast emptiness within the heavens. "Numinous" denotes the Eightfold Convergence of Numinous Writings and the spontaneous jade scripts. "Chapters" are the harmonious convergence of words, their radiance interweaving into patterns. The "Eightfold Convergence" refers to the qi of the eight directions. "Spontaneous" clarifies that the origin of these numinous chapters lies in the coalescence of the true and wondrous qi of the eight directions within the emptiness and cavernousness, where the numinous winds stir and play, naturally forming these words and chapters—not crafted by deliberate effort, hence called "spontaneous numinous chapters."

The hidden rhythms of the heavens are the celestial sounds.
**Dong states:** "Rhythms" are melodies; "sounds" are chapters. Each heaven possesses an eight-character chapter, its melodies and rhythms concealed. The text is profound and abstruse, difficult to trace in detail, hence called "hidden rhythms."
**Youxi remarks:** These are also the subtle hidden rhythms of the heavens, the esoteric sounds of the Ten Directions.
**Xuan Ying remarks:** "Sounds" are echoes. A single emission is a voice; the interweaving of the five tones forms patterns, called "sounds."

The *Records of Music* in the *Book of Rites* states: "When sounds form patterns, they are called *yin*."

The exalted ones of the heavens, the gods of the heavens.
**Dong states:** Among the heavens there are also the most exalted, as well as great gods.
**Youxi remarks:** The exalted are the imperial lords of the thirty-two heavens; the gods are the divine kings of the flying immortals of the Ten Directions.

The great demons of the heavens, the numinous ones of the heavens.
**Dong states:** The great demons are the demon kings of the Three Realms; the numinous ones are the various numinous officials such as the Controllers of Destiny, Recorders of Deeds, and Overseers of Ascent.

Nine harmonies and ten unions transform and ascend to the Upper Clarity.
**Dong states:** "Harmony" means dissolution; "union" means convergence. In the era of Dragon Han, when all karmic conditions were exhausted, the Heavenly King transcended the courts of the Three Realms, entered the halls of the Great Void, and received the ninefold refinement of immortal transcendence, thereby attaining the title of Great Sage. When the Kalpa of Red Clarity began, the Primordial Beginning bestowed upon him the title of Brahma-Transcendence Heavenly King. Radiant, he ascended through the numinous gates and mounted the Jade Clarity Palace.
**Youxi remarks:** This clarifies that the gods and numinous ones of the heavens, as well as the great demons, are all masters of ascent and recorders of destinies. If the nine harmonies and ten unions mutually uphold one another, one can instantly transform and ascend to the Upper Clarity.
**Shaowei remarks:** The exalted are the lofty sages of the highest rank; the gods are the divine kings of the flying immortals; the great demons are the demon kings of the Three Realms; the numinous ones are the numinous chapters of the Five Emperors.

The jade characters emerge from the essence of the ninefold *qi* harmonized and the sounds of the ten directions united, transforming to ascend to the heavens of the Upper Clarity and flowing throughout the thirty-two realms.
The *Jade Instructions* states: The numinous chapters of the Five Emperors, the true texts of the Five Emperors, and the Five Elders arise together, governing the *qi* of the Nine Heavens.
**Xuanying remarks:** This elucidates the origin of the true texts and jade characters, which all derive from the exalted sages of the heavens, the divine kings of the flying immortals, the demon kings of the Three Realms, the Five Great Emperors, and the like. Harmonizing the essence of the ninefold *qi* and uniting the sounds of the Ten Directions, they transform into the wonders of the Upper Clarity Heaven and flow throughout the thirty-two heavens, forming the numinous chapters.

The nine *qi* are the *qi* of the Nine Heavens. Their boundless mysteries are profound and unfathomable.
**Dong states:** "Mysteries" means hidden; "fathom" means to examine in detail. The boundless texts are recondite in meaning, difficult to scrutinize.
**Youxi remarks:** This scripture can transform the mortal into the sagely, refine the coarse into the wondrous, transcend the Five Turbidities, and tread the Three Clarities—its mysteries are unfathomable, its principles beyond words.

The divine perfected are arrayed, universally delivering heavenly and human beings.
**Dong states:** "Array" means to spread; "place" means to establish. The Primordial Beginning, following the kalpic cycles, delivers beings by spreading and establishing the divine perfected, founding the thirty-two heavens, stabilizing the Five Peaks, and universally delivering heavenly and human beings.
**Youxi remarks:** "Array" means to unfold; "place" means to expand. The manner of unfolding and establishing is vast and boundless, signifying that this scripture’s divine perfected and immortal transformations are arrayed and expanded, universally delivering beings without end between heaven and earth.
**Xuanying remarks:** This speaks of the Heavenly Worthy arraying the jade strategies and true texts to universally deliver heavenly beings, humans, gods, and ghosts.

Today, rejoicing in the reception of deliverance, we traverse the passes of all heavens.
**Dong states:** Formerly, in the Heaven of Beginning Azure, within the Jeweled Pearl, the Dao Lord received the ten divisions of wondrous scriptures. At that time, the Primordial Beginning led the great sages of the Ten Directions, the divine kings of the flying immortals, and their boundless hosts into the Jeweled Pearl. When the scriptures were fully expounded, the perfected ones oversaw the deliverance and bestowed them upon the Dao Lord. At that moment, the joy was ineffable, and the thirty-two heavens universally passed through the covenantal gates. The lands of the Ten Directions all received deliverance, and the roots of karmic offenses and sins were simultaneously absolved.
**Youxi remarks:** Having bathed in the oversight of the divine perfected, one forever relies upon the grace of ascent. Above, the thirty-two heavens are passed; below, the nine dark realms are informed. At this time, the rejoicing is beyond words.

We beseech the eradication of the Three Evils and the severance of the roots of the earthly.
**Dong states:** The Three Evils are the three paths. The first is sensual desire, the second is craving, and the third is greed—these are the Three Evil Gates. The "roots of the earthly" refers to hell. We beseech the eradication of the path of the Three Evils and the severance of the roots of hell.

We fly through the Five Gates and inscribe our names in the Great Mystery.
**Dong states:** The Five Gates are the five paths of rebirth, as previously explained, now reiterated. The first is the suffering of the mind from sensual burdens; the second, the suffering of the spirit from craving; the third, the suffering of the body from greed; the fourth, the suffering of essence from floral competition; the fifth, the suffering of the soul from bodily burdens. One exits through the gate, hence called "gates." The Great Mystery is the Great Mystery Capital. Humans, endowed with nature and harmonious *yin-yang*, free from desires and untouched by the Three Evils or Five Desires, fly through the gates of the Five Sufferings and ascend directly to the palaces of the Mystery Capital.
**Youxi remarks:** The Five Gates are the portals of the five paths. The five paths consist of the previous Three Evils with the addition of the paths of *qi* and humanity, totaling five. Having severed the tendencies toward the Three Evils and transcended the gates of the five paths, one’s name is stricken from the ghostly registers of Fengdu and inscribed in the immortal ledgers of the Great Mystery. The Great Mystery is the Nine Palaces of the Mystery Center, the realm of the Upper Clarity.

The demon kings oversee and recommend, unhindered at the gates of heaven.
**Dong states:** "Hindered" means obstructed. When one receives the demon kings’ protection and recommendation, one ascends directly to the Three Clarities, passes through the gates of heaven without obstruction, and roams freely in the Upper Clarity.
**Shaowei remarks:** The Heavenly Worthy bestows the celestial passport for ascent, and the demon kings protect and recommend it. At every gate of heaven, none dare obstruct or interrogate.
The *Divine Scripture of the Cavernous Spirit’s Celestial Passport* is the sixty-eighth character in the "Human Sovereign Text," inscribed on azure silk and worn on the body. On the day a Daoist ascends to heaven, without this passport, the Five Peaks will detain their soul and prevent their ascent.

Without this passport, the rivers and seas will detain one’s blood and fluids, preventing their ascent. Without this passport, the Earthly Officials will detain one’s form, preventing their transcendence. Without this passport, the Heavenly Officials will bar the gates of heaven, preventing their advance. The officers and soldiers at the gates of heaven demand and inspect the passport; once obtained, one proceeds directly into the Purple Court of the Great One, meets the Lord of the Great Dao, and thereafter all spirits dare not detain or restrain them.

The Eastern Dipper governs lifespan, the Western Dipper records names.
**Dong states:** In the Heavenly Center of the Eastern Flower, there is the Terrace of Scattered Blossoms, where the Four Dipper Perfected govern, overseeing the recording of lifespans and merits of life and death. Those with merit have their names recorded by the Western Dipper.
**Youxi remarks:** The Eastern Dipper is the first star of the Dipper, governing the augmentation of lifespan. The Western Dipper is the second star of the Dipper, governing the recording of merits and names.

The Northern Dipper casts down death, the Southern Dipper elevates life.
**Dong states:** The Southern and Northern Dippers govern life and death. Those with good deeds are reported by the Three Officials, and the Southern Dipper delivers them from the trials of the Three Realms, rescues them from the sufferings of the Nine Darks, and proclaims to the demon kings, preventing them from disrupting the practitioner’s evil deeds. The Three Officials then report to the Northern Dipper, which commands the demon kings to seize the person’s soul and consign it to the servitude of the Nine Darks for ten thousand kalpas, eternally mired in evil affinities. At that time, without good deeds or response, the Northern Dipper removes their name from the register of death, and the Southern Dipper inscribes their name in the register of life.
**Youxi remarks:** The Northern Dipper is the sixth star of the Dipper, governing the removal of names from the register of death. The Southern Dipper is the fifth star of the Dipper, governing the inscription of names in the register of life.

The Central Dipper, the Great Chief, oversees all spirits.
**Dong states:** *Kui* means great; *ling* means spirit. Within the Dipper resides the Spirit Youth, named Yu Fu, who constantly revolves the Wheel of Great Non-Being, turning the Ten Cycles to summon the Perfected. He governs the celestial passes of the ten directions. The Ten Cycles refer to the Great Saints of the ten directions ascending to the Jade Palace; when the myriad spirits and lofty perfected gather, Yu Fu intones.
**Youxi remarks:** *Kui* means chief. The Central Dipper is the seventh star of the Dipper, the head of the Four Dippers, overseeing all spirits of the body. These Five Directional Dippers are the five stars of the Northern Dipper, governing the five directions. Since they are Dipper stars, they are referred to as the Eastern Dipper and Western Dipper, not that each direction has its own Dipper.
**Shaowei remarks:** This clarifies that the Dipper lodges of the five directions each receive their offices from the Primordial Beginning. The seven lodges of the Eastern Direction govern lifespan; the seven lodges of the Western Direction record people’s transgressions; the seven lodges of the Northern Direction cast down names from the register of death; the seven lodges of the Southern Direction inscribe names in the register of life; the Central Direction refers to what people now call the Northern Dipper. The *Treatise on the Celestial Offices* states: "The Dipper is the Emperor’s chariot, revolving at the center, overseeing the four quarters, and examining portents." Zhang Heng’s *Spiritual Constitution* also says: "One resides at the center, thus it is known as the Dipper. The Dipper is the Central Ultimate." Since the people of the Divine Continent dwell south of the Ultimate, gazing northward, it is called the Northern Dipper and Northern Ultimate. In discussing this, it is truly akin to the royal mandate being issued to the four directions, thereby revealing the heart of heaven. It speaks of the Central Dipper as the great commander of *qi*, overseeing all spirits, life and death, transgressions and blessings.
**Commentary states:** The *Oral Instructions of the True One* says: "Within the Dipper itself are five Dippers: Yang Brightness is the Eastern Dipper, Yin Essence is the Western Dipper, Cinnabar Prime is the Southern Dipper, the Northern Ultimate is the Northern Dipper, and the Celestial Pass is the Central Dipper." This may not be the case. Now, the Eastern Dipper refers to the seven lodges of the Eastern Direction—Horn, Neck, and others—whose office is Lesser Yang, governing the calculation of lifespans, and where people inscribe their merits and names. The Western Dipper refers to the seven lodges of the Western Direction—Legs, Bond, and others—whose office is Greater Yin, governing the recording of people’s good names. The Northern Dipper refers to the seven lodges of the Northern Direction—Dipper, Ox, and others—whose office is also Greater Yin, and which also governs death, thus removing names from the register of death. The Southern Dipper refers to the seven lodges of the Southern Direction—Well, Ghost, and others—whose office is Greater Yang, and which also governs life, thus inscribing names in the register of life. The Central Dipper refers to the seven lodges such as the Chief and others, the so-called Central Dipper that oversees the Four Dippers and all matters of spirits, life and death, transgressions and blessings.

The Azure Emperor guards the *hun*-soul, the White Emperor attends the *po*-soul, the Vermilion Emperor nurtures *qi*, the Black Emperor circulates blood.
**Dong states:** The Lord Azure Emperor’s surname is Yan, personal name Kai Ming, style Ling Wei Yang, and he constantly governs the *hun*-soul. The Lord White Emperor’s surname is Shang Jin, personal name Chang Kai, style Yao Po Bao, and he constantly governs the *po*-soul. The Lord Vermilion Emperor’s surname is Dong Fu, personal name Ji Yan, style Chi Biao Nu, and he governs the expansive yang *qi*, residing in the Mansion of the Heart. The Lord Black Emperor’s surname is Hei Jie, personal name Ling Hui, style Yin Hou Ju, and he governs blood and *qi*, presiding over the kidneys.
The Perfected of the Upper Clarity state: The Lord Azure Emperor’s surname is Chang, personal name Jing Ming; the Lord White Emperor’s surname is Hun, name *Cao Ru Shou*; the Lord Vermilion Emperor’s surname is Yan, personal name Dong Dan; the Lord Black Emperor’s surname is Xuan, personal name Ming Meng.
**Youxi remarks:** The Azure Emperor’s position is in the East, governing Wood, overseeing the liver, where the *hun*-soul is stored, hence he guards the *hun*-soul. The White Emperor’s position is in the West, governing Metal, overseeing the lungs, where the *po*-soul is stored, hence he attends the *po*-soul. The Vermilion Emperor’s position is in the South, governing Fire, overseeing *qi*, and since *qi* is born of Fire, he nurtures *qi*. The Black Emperor’s position is in the North, governing Water, overseeing blood, and since blood returns to Water, he circulates blood.

The Yellow Emperor, central sovereign, is not surpassed by the myriad spirits.
**Dong states:** The Lord Yellow Emperor’s surname is Tong Ban, personal name Yuan Cheng, style Han Shu Niu, and he governs earthly *qi*, residing in the spleen.
The Perfected of the Upper Clarity state: His surname is Ma, personal name Zhong Shen.
**Youxi remarks:** The Yellow Emperor resides at the Golden Flower Mountain in the Heavenly Center, where the Five Emperors hold court.

The Five Emperor Divine Kings govern within their palaces, ever generating clouds of five colors, with the sun and moon flanking their sides, and flying immortals winging their chariots. The Five Emperors in Heaven preside over flying immortals; on Earth, they are enthroned upon the Five Peaks, governing ghosts and spirits; within humans, they rule the five viscera, presiding over the five spirits. The liver stores the *hun*-soul, the lungs store the *po*-soul, the heart stores *qi*, the kidneys store blood, and the spleen resides in the central palace, governing the flesh. Thus, humans emulate Earth, Earth emulates Heaven, Heaven emulates the Dao, the Dao emulates spontaneity, and spirits have their proper abode—hence it is said there is no transgression. The triad unites to perfect their virtue.

**Shaowei states:** This clarifies that the Five Elder Emperor Lords each receive the vermilion-script talismanic mandate. In Heaven, they govern the divine immortals of the five directions; on Earth, they govern the spirits and ghosts of the Five Peaks; within humans, they govern the spirits of the five viscera. Each has its proper governance, so there is no transgression. The sequence of decrees is fully set forth in the Perfected Writ.

The Azure Heaven Demon King is Bayuan Choubo.
**Dong states:** The Azure Heaven Demon King’s surname is Bin, personal name Chichengba. The Azure Heaven Demon King was born together with the Primordial Beginning, commanding the Nine Heavens. Choubo is also a Demon King of the Three Realms, presiding over their midst. If cultivators recognize his name, they enjoy blessings; if they fail to recognize it, they suffer calamity. Those who gain the Demon King’s protection ascend bodily into the Three Clarities.

**Youxi remarks:** This pertains to the Azure Emperor. The first four characters denote his title, the next two his personal name, and the last two his style. The rest follow this pattern.

The Vermilion Heaven Demon King bears Heaven and shoulders stone.
**Dong states:** The Vermilion Heaven Demon King’s surname is Fu, personal name Yousu. His might can lift the sky, his strength can topple mountains. He soars through the Three Realms, obstructing human merit and subduing the host of demons.

**Youxi remarks:** This pertains to the Vermilion Emperor.

The White Emperor Demon King overturns mountains with six eyes.
**Dong states:** The White Heaven Demon King’s surname is Chi, personal name Zhangshi. With one head and six eyes, he can shatter mountains and overturn stones, commanding the ghostly spirits of the Six Heavens and severing the paths of human rebirth.

**Youxi remarks:** This pertains to the White Emperor.

The Black Heaven Demon King is Jianchou Langfu.
**Dong states:** The Black Heaven Demon King’s surname is Xu, personal name Zhishi. His nature is fierce and ugly, delighting in slaughter.

**Youxi remarks:** This pertains to the Black Emperor.

The Yellow Heaven Demon King spans Heaven with his strength.
**Dong states:** The Yellow Heaven Demon King’s surname is Tianmen, personal name Bokuang, the Great Demon King. His body is clad in a robe of dark patterns, his head crowned with a Heaven-spanning diadem, his waist girded with a dragon-headed sword. He ever rides a feathered-wheel chariot, flying amidst the clouds.

They often compose ballads and songs of three thousand words, confounding and corrupting later students. The Most High therefore recorded their melodies in the *Precious Scripture for Dispelling Demons*.

**Youxi remarks:** This pertains to the Yellow Emperor. His position, title, and name are the same as the Azure Emperor, for he presides over the protection of Dao-seekers and the expulsion of demonic trials.

**Shaowei states:** Next are the demonic spirits who disrupt the destinies of the ordained, executing the patriarchs of lineages. Those called "Heavenly Demon Bodies" were all, in former lives, diligent in precepts, almsgiving, and vigorous cultivation—yet could not bear the success of others, and thus reaped this retribution.

The Five Thearch Demon Kings are the ancestors of the myriad spirits.

**Dong states:** The Azure Emperor Demon King’s surname is Poluo, personal name Wanxing. The Vermilion Emperor Demon King’s surname is Zhe, personal name Shangbai. The White Emperor Demon King’s surname is Deng, personal name Xuer. The Black Emperor Demon King’s surname is Xiao, personal name Gongsun. The Yellow Emperor Demon King’s surname is Wangong, personal name Chansheng. Each commands an official retinue of thirty-eight thousand, born together with the Six Heavens. They govern the Three Realms, their merit equal to that of the heavens, and serve as the ancestors of ghosts and spirits.

**Youxi remarks:** These Five Directional Heavenly Thearchs and Five Heaven Demon Kings together govern all the deities of the Five Heavens and Five Directions—hence they are called "ancestors."

They fly with drumming retinues, commanding ghostly armies.

**Xuanying states:** This describes the Five Thearch Demon Kings, who constantly lead ghostly troops in flight through the Great Void, their retinues resounding with drumming and music—hence "flying with drumming retinues."

Waving banners and beating drums, they roam and observe the vast firmament.

**Dong states:** Their ghostly and divine attendants bear curved canopies and banners of five colors—mystic yellow and dark—flying amidst the clouds, surveying the ten directions, circling through the boundless sky.

**Youxi remarks:** The Flying Celestial Numinous Demons ride the void and harness the floating, leading and following with ghostly troops, bearing banners and staffs, striking drums and brandishing pennants. They enter and exit the true realms, traversing the vast firmament.

**Shaowei states:** The *Hidden Writ of Jade Purity* says: Each of the Five Emperor Demon Kings wears a tiger-headed pouch, commands an official retinue of thirty-eight thousand, and is born coeval with Heaven. They constantly harass and disrupt students. Though they do not desire the Way’s fulfillment, they vaunt themselves as equal in sagely merit to the Heavenly Thearchs. Later, during the Dragon Han era when charts were revealed, they submitted to the transformation of the Primordial Beginning. Thus the *Hymn of Pacing the Void* says: "The Demon Kings respectfully receive their duties, and thus can ascend to the heavens."

**Xuanying states:** When the Great Sage travels, all ranks of his regalia and adornments are arrayed. The *hui* (pennant) derives its meaning from pointing and beckoning, with feathers affixed to the top of a pole, resembling a banner. Kings wield it to swear oaths, while those who administer oaths proclaim the commands and covenants—akin to a ruler issuing decrees today. The *chuang* (banner) resembles a flag or canopy. The *gujie* (drums and staffs) refers to the rhythmic music of drumming and piping. This describes the Five Heaven Demon Kings, each leading their legions, erecting banners, pennants, drums, and staffs, roaming and observing the Great Void. Their mounted retinues throng together, indulging every whim. They style themselves as resplendent and majestic, their merit equal to that of the heavens.

**Dong states:** Their attendants are resplendent, their majesty complete, their power rivaling that of the heavens—hence "equal in merit."

**Xuanying states:** Having arrayed such majesty, they further proclaim themselves resplendent and exalted, esteeming their own nobility.

When the heavens deliver humanity, they strictly govern Fengdu in the north.

**Dong states:** The Demon Kings, ruling the Three Realms from the Mystic Capital, constantly inspect the ghostly registers of Fengdu in the north, tallying the karmic debts of the dead. The above concerns the Mystic Capital’s protection of those worthy of deliverance.

**Youxi remarks:** Since they lead and follow with banners, drums, and staffs, they style themselves as resplendent. Yet they also assist in the deliverance of students, restraining and subduing demonic trials—thus their merit equals that of the heavens. *Hexi* describes their august and flourishing appearance.

**Shaowei states:** When the Heavenly Worthy delivers humanity in the Celestial Azure Heaven, he summons the Northern Thearch to proclaim to the Demon Kings, commanding them to behead and exterminate demonic spirits, forbidding them to inflict calamities. In every kalpa when humanity is delivered, the decree remains thus.

The Divine Duke receives the mandate and universally sweeps away inauspiciousness.

**Dong states:** The Divine Duke is the Prime Minister of the Great Luo Heaven, named Kuoyi, residing in the Terrace of Primordial Yang. He oversees the deliverance of divine and human beings across the great thousand worlds, ascending them to the Hall of Boundless Merit, expelling inauspiciousness and evil. At that time, he receives the Heavenly Worthy’s talismanic mandate to sweep away the essences of the myriad demons and inauspicious ghosts, rescue those bound in the Three Bureaus, deliver the guests of rebirth, establish life registers in the Vermilion Palace, sever the roots of death for nine generations, bestow luminous blessings upon perfected beings, dispel the dark nights of ten thousand kalpas, and grant rebirth through the Divine Duke.

**Youxi remarks:** The Divine Duke is the Divine Duke of the Great Luo. "Receiving the mandate" refers to the command to subdue the Five Thearch Demon Kings, enabling him to protect students and sweep away inauspiciousness.

The Eight Awes spew poison, fierce steeds gallop in four directions.

**Dong states:** The Eight Awes are the dragon scales, tiger leopards, lions, cinnabar serpents, heavenly horses, and ferocious beasts—their poison spewing in four directions.

**Youxi remarks:** The Eight Awes are the divine dragons of the Eight Awes. The fierce steeds are the celestial swift horses of the spirit realm. The divine dragons spew poison to subdue demonic vapors, while the swift steeds charge forth to pursue evil spirits.

Heavenly Ding advance as vanguard, great marshals wield banners.

**Dong states:** The Heavenly Ding are the Five Ding warriors. The great marshals are the generals who supervise killing and punishment. They lead heavenly troops with ceremonial canopies and banners, their majestic regalia arrayed before and behind, exterminating inauspiciousness and annihilating demonic and ghostly evils.

**Youxi remarks:** The Heavenly Ding are the armored soldiers of Heavenly Zou, hence they lead the advance to drive away evil. The great marshals are the demonic ghostly marshals, hence they wield banners to repel and expel.

Hurling fire for ten thousand leagues, ringing bells through the eight directions.

**Dong states:** The flowing golden fire bells on the left and right, when hurled, blaze for ten thousand leagues. Their radiant light interweaves through the eight directions, filling the empty void to dispel demons and annihilate ghosts.

**Youxi remarks:** The hurling of fire and flowing bells refers to the flowing golden fire bells. When cast, they resound through the Great Ultimate, their radiance shaking a thousand leagues. Thus, their blazing light extends for ten thousand leagues in interwoven splendor, surging through the eight directions in a crashing strike. The Perfected Ones constantly wield them to subdue and command demonic essences.

**Shaowei states:** As the *Dongzhen Sutra* says: "The fire bells possess radiance but no substance; with a single cast, they span ten thousand leagues. Should any dare to test them, they will be fiercely repelled by the Supreme Perfected." **Dong adds:** The myriad demons conceal their forms, and the hundred ghosts dare not resist. "Giant" here means resistance.

**Youxi remarks:** It means they do not repel the Supreme Perfected. Those who hold this scripture are thus counted among the Supreme Perfected.

**Execution with metal and iron proceeds ahead, while the Giant Heavenly Ones mete out punishment behind.**
**Dong states:** The *yue* resembles an axe. The Giant Heavenly Ones are the Heavenly Ding force-soldiers. Thus, metal *yue* and axes execute ahead, while the Giant Heavenly Ones wield blades to punish behind. "Metal" is also a general term for iron; some say the *yue* are adorned with gold, hence called "golden *yue*." It is also said that the Heavenly Ding force-soldiers execute ahead and behead behind to eradicate demonic and ghostly essences.

**Shaowei states:** If any ghosts or spirits dare to act recklessly, unleashing harm to obstruct our Supreme Perfected, the Heavenly Ding are dispatched to execute them ahead and behead them behind.

**Slaughtering ghostly souls, wind and fire never cease.**
**Dong states:** "Slaughtering" means to rend and shatter. "Souls" refers to the hun. "Wind and fire" are the wind-blades and fire-mountains. Ghostly souls are rent and shattered upon the wind-blades and fire-mountains.

**Youxi remarks:** Slaughtering the souls of ghosts and severing the essences of demons—swift as the wind, rapid as fire—hence it is said that wind and fire never cease.

**Severing a thousand thousand heads, shearing ten thousand ten thousand forms.**
**Dong states:** "Heads" are the skulls; "forms" are the bodies. Of the myriad sinful ghosts and souls, their heads are struck off, their bodies dissected and flayed.

**Youxi remarks:** "A thousand thousand, ten thousand ten thousand" expresses their multitude, not a fixed number. Some have their heads struck off, others their forms dissected. This is because where there is truth, there is falsehood; where there is goodness, there is evil. Thus, falsehood can obstruct truth, and evil can corrupt goodness.

**Demons dare not trespass, ghosts dare not manifest their malevolent essences.**
**Dong states:** The hundred demons cower in concealment, the myriad malevolent spirits lose their essences. Having slaughtered essences and severed souls, then struck off heads and flayed forms—how could any dare to trespass, or presume to offend again?

**Youxi remarks:** By wielding this mighty punishment to eradicate ghostly and demonic foes, the hundred demons are forced into hiding, and the host of malevolent spirits lose their essences.

**The Three Officials of the Northern Fengdu scrutinize the ghostly encampments.**
**Dong states:** The Three Officials are the Celestial, Terrestrial, and Aquatic Officials. The Northern Fengdu is the Northern Bureau for the Investigation of Treachery. Within the Nine Bureaus of Fengdu, there are nine divisions for investigating treachery. There are also the Nine Envoys of the Nine Capitals, originally nine beasts born from the nine *qi* after the final kalpa of the Dragon Han, who harmed the wicked. Once the kalpa unfolded, the nine beasts were renamed the Nine Ugly Ghosts. The Supreme Perfected of the Northern Emperor reside above Fengdu, establishing the Nine Ugly Ones to assist the Three Officials. Their numbers reach eighty-one myriad, measuring the celestial *qi*. The Nine Ugly Ones exchange titles to become the Nine Envoys of the Nine Capitals, constantly inspecting the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus. The souls of the good and evil cannot conceal themselves.

**Youxi remarks:** The Three Officials are the Three Officials of the Six Palaces, which lie above the Northern Fengdu. The Three Officials govern the host of ghosts, thus they are ordered to guard the encampments and domains, preventing them from trespassing against those who study the Dao.

**No concealment is permitted; the Golden Horse Post reports in haste.**
**Dong states:** The Golden Horse is the Golden Dragon. To inspect good and evil, the post-horses gallop swiftly to report the matters.

**Youxi remarks:** If any attempt to conceal or hide, the Golden Horse Post immediately arrives to report. The Golden Horse is said to be as unyielding as a vajra steed, hence the term "Golden Horse Post reports."

**Shaowei states:** Fearing their might, the ghostly encampments are openly scrutinized. Should any flee or hide, daring not to conceal themselves, each post and dragon-gate swiftly reports, hastening to present the matter—as with the time limits of post-horses in the mortal world.

**Universally proclaimed without end, the myriad spirits all heed.**
**Dong states:** Universally proclaimed to all divine spirits above and below heaven and earth, all are made to listen and submit.

**Youxi remarks:** From heaven above to heaven below, from the hidden to the obscure, all proclamations near and far are universally heeded.

**The Three Realms and Five Emperors, their names listed in the Supreme Clarity.**
**Dong states:** When the Divine Lords receive their mandate, they universally proclaim to the divine kings of the Three Realms and Five Emperors, and all spirits, releasing the evil and opposing dead souls from the earthly prisons. Their names are all listed in the Supreme Clarity.

**Youxi remarks:** The Three Realms are the demon kings of the Three Realms; the Five Emperors are the Five Emperors and the Great Demon, their names listed together. They are summoned to protect and deliver the students, ascending to the gates of the Supreme Clarity to present themselves before the Most High.

**Shaowei states:** The Divine Lords, steadfast and upright, universally proclaim without end. The Five Emperors and myriad spirits all come to heed their commands.

**The demonic armies are already vanquished; their names are listed and presented to the Supreme Clarity.**

**Xuanying states:** The Three Realms refer to the realms of desire and form among the heavens. *The Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme Ultimate for the Salvation of All Beings, with Four Commentaries, Volume Two* concludes here.
*Volume Three of The Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme Ultimate for the Salvation of All Beings, with Four Commentaries* begins.

The *Primordial Cavern Jade Chronicle*, Dong states: "Primordial" refers to the Primordial Beginning; "Cavern" means to penetrate. "Jade" signifies the jade script; "Chronicle" means to record. The Primordial Beginning condensed the essence of spontaneity, forming the eight-cornered, radiant script. The Mysterious Cavern pervaded the void, its light illuminating the four directions. The Two Modes divided, and the sun, moon, and stars thereby arrayed their brilliance. Treasured by all sages, it was named the *Jade Chronicle*, recording the kalpas of heaven and earth and reckoning the celestial reckonings. The Perfected Ones inscribed its affairs, compiling them into scripture—hence it is called the *Jade Chronicle*.

Shaowei states: The *Primordial Cavern* refers to the Primordial Lord of Heaven coalescing the primordial qi of the Cavern of True Perfection into the *Jade Chronicle*, to record meritorious deeds and inscribe the nine ranks of immortals. From the nine ranks of immortals, one ascends to the nine Perfected, and thence to the nine Sages, only then transcending the Three Realms, roaming freely in the Supreme Clarity, merging with the Dao in truth, forever immune to descent.

**Dragon Han and Yan Kang.**
Dong states: "Dragon" signifies the numinous; "Han" means great. The jade script first appeared, emerging to instruct the perfected, displaying divine marvels—thus it was named the Hall of Great Blessings, the Abode of Everlasting Joy in the Land of Felicity. Vast and boundless transformation was called the Dragon Han. "Yan" means long; "Kang" means peace. When the Dragon Han kalpa ended, the celestial jade script concealed its radiance, the sun and moon extinguished their light, heaven and earth plunged into darkness, indistinguishable—long-lasting tranquility, thus named Yan Kang.

Youxi states: The *Primordial Cavern Jade Chronicle* is the name of the celestial Cavern’s chronological records. *Dragon Han* and *Yan Kang* are the designations of kalpas in the boundless, obscure past. The Yan Kang kalpa preceded the Dragon Han—these are the two past kalpas.

Shaowei states: This chapter discusses the formation and dissolution of kalpas. *The Mysterious Record of Mount Gui* states that the *Primordial Sovereign of the Cavern* is qi. The Heavenly Worthy condensed the qi of the Primordial Cavern into the *Jade Chronicle*. This chronicle takes the Dragon Han kalpa as the first kalpa; the kalpa of the unfolding chart is called the Red Brightness kalpa, and its end is called the Yan Kang kalpa, cycling endlessly, concluding only to begin anew. "Yan" means long; "Kang" means peace. After a kalpa ends, the Three Realms become empty wastelands, the spirits of all beings abide in the Great Void in long-lasting peace—thus Yan Kang is the designation of the kalpa of dissolution, while Red Brightness is the name of the kalpa of unfolding. The alternation of these two constitutes the Great Kalpa, and thus all endings are called Yan Kang. The intervening unfolding is typically called Red Brightness. The remaining kalpas—*Primordial Sovereign* and *Supreme Sovereign*—are names of lesser kalpas. *The Numinous Chapters* states: The Dragon Han inherits the Yan Kang realm to inaugurate its era; Red Brightness unfolds its light, and heaven and earth resume their positions. This refers to the Yan Kang and Red Brightness following the Dragon Han.

Xuanying states: "Primordial" signifies the root and origin; "Cavern" signifies the empty and boundless. Jade is the most precious of treasures; "chronicle" takes its name from reckoning. This clarifies that the Primordial Lord of Heaven used this true script to record the great reckonings of past kalpas and their endings. As this true script is precious and its reckonings reliable, it is treasured and preserved—hence called the *Jade Chronicle*.

**In the boundless kalpas of the primordial chaos,**
Dong states: "Boundless" means lofty and distant.

The term "亿" (yì) denotes ten thousand myriad. As for "劫" (kalpa), as previously explained in the chapter on the Primordial Jade Characters sinking into the Yan Kang, one sinking spans a kalpa of myriad eons—truly a number as countless as grains of sand. "混" (hùn) means "to merge"; before heaven and earth were distinguished, all was chaos as one.

Youxi states: These two kalpas stretch so distant and remote that their reckonings defy all measure, shrouded in profound obscurity within the primordial darkness.

Shaowei states: Since the kalpa of the Ancestral Beginning, the kalpas have been as innumerable as dust and sand, impossible to recount in full—thus we speak broadly of "myriad kalpas." When the reckoning of myriad kalpas reaches its end, all returns to chaos, yet the essence and spirit of the myriad beings remain within.

The *Scripture of the Dragon’s Leap* states: When the kalpa of the Three Realms collapses, chaos reigns without form. With each kalpa’s renewal, the Three Qi serve as its foundation. Above, there is no longer azure light; below, there are no longer abyssal depths.

Dong states: "Color" refers to the azure radiance; "abyss" refers to depth. The accumulation of emptiness forms azure; the accumulation of rivers forms abysses—thus heaven is high and azure, water is deep and abyssal, and human essence is spiritual. Heaven possesses the Three Lights to bestow illumination; earth possesses the Three Rivers to receive streams; humans possess the Three Palaces to house the spirit. When humans attain proper principle, heaven and earth are at peace, and the Yan Kang era arrives—then heaven no longer bears azure light, and all becomes chaos at once.

Youxi states: With the end of each kalpic cycle, the Three Lights darken, and the world of heaven and earth returns to primordial chaos. The Dao reverts to its root source, and the myriad beings lose their unity—then what azure light remains above, or what abyss below?

Shaowei states: At the end of each kalpa, the Twenty-Eight Heavens above are extinguished, leaving no radiance; the Nine Ramparts and Thirty-Six Earths below are exhausted, leaving no springs.

The Wind Marsh pervades the void; the Vajra bears up heaven.

Dong states: The Wind Marsh is the qi of the Primordial Beginning’s Brahma-wind. "Pervades" means to penetrate; "void" means nothingness. "Vajra" signifies truth; "strong" signifies firmness. The qi of the Wind Marsh is firmer than true metal—hence called the "Vajra Wind." Enveloping the Nine Ramparts and supporting the Nine Heavens, it permeates the void, lifting the essence of the limpid Han, floating high and unbounded, suspended yet unfallen. The true qi of the Vajra upholds heaven, governing the emptiness to sustain its suspension, while earth is bound to the Vajra qi.

Youxi states: The Wind Marsh is the qi of the Dao; the Vajra is the qi of essence. The qi of the Dao is supremely yielding, thus it pervades the void; the qi of essence is supremely firm, thus it forms the heavens. The kalpas unfold naturally, and the celestial realm endures—though without light, it is still called "heaven."

Shaowei states: The Wind Marsh is the qi of the Eighth Rampart. The qi of the Wind Marsh is as hard and firm as metal—hence called "Vajra" or "Vajra Wind." At the end of a kalpa, it fills the empty void, bearing up heaven without collapse.

According to the *Inner Tone of the Nine Earths and the Numinous Cinnabar Scripture*: Twenty billion myriad li beneath the earth lies the Moist Marsh Earth, its qi yellow; another twenty billion myriad li below lies the Firm Marsh Earth, its qi purple; another twenty billion myriad li below lies the Great Wind Marsh Earth, its qi azure. Beyond this stretch boundless depths—without end, without limit, without edge—forming the Nether Abyss Framework Earth, its qi green. All are sustained by the Brahma-wind’s framework. This qi upholds the earthly wheel, suspending it without fall. Each of the Nine Ramparts has Four Sovereigns, totaling Thirty-Six Sovereigns, corresponding to the Thirty-Six Heavens above. If a practitioner does not know the Inner Tone of Heaven, the Heavenly Emperor will not recognize their name; if they do not know the Inner Tone of Earth, the Earthly Sovereigns will not record their register—thus they remain forever barred from attaining immortality.

Between heaven above and earth below, there is no obscurity, no darkness, no form, no shadow, no limit, no end.

Dong states: "Obscurity" means distant; "darkness" means near. Between heaven above and earth below, there is no height or depth, no far or near—all is indistinct and dark. "Form" refers to heaven and earth; "shadow" refers to the Three Lights. "Limit" means exhaustion; "end" means termination. Heaven and earth have no form; sun and moon have no light—exhausting the inexhaustible, ending the unending.

Youxi states: Above heaven, there is no obscurity or darkness—it is unfathomable; below heaven, there is no shadow or form—it is unobservable. Existing between above and below, its end cannot be known; its limit is but the self-so, naturally independent.

The Primordial Darkness of the Great Brahma stretches boundless and vast, without light.

Dong states: "Primordial Darkness" means distant and enduring; "Great Brahma" refers to qi. "Vast" means empty and remote. When the Primordial Beginning sinks into the Yan Kang, the Primordial Darkness endures, vast and empty, for myriad kalpas without light.

Youxi states: The "Great Brahma" is the Great Dao. The qi of the Great Dao is darkly mysterious and undifferentiated—hence called the realm of Primordial Darkness and emptiness. Vast and indistinct, it has not yet brightened—hence said to be without light.

Shaowei states: Such is the state at the end of a kalpic cycle. Above the Three Realms and below the Four Peoples, there is no obscurity or darkness, no form or shadow, no limit or end—only the vast nothingness of the Great Brahma, the boundless expanse of Primordial Darkness, and the original light of the Three Radiances.

Xuanying states: "Primordial Darkness" describes the unfathomable emptiness; "vast" means distant and boundless; "expansive" means empty and without edge. This clarifies that within the Three Realms, there is no light of sun or moon—only the qi of the Great Brahma, filling the Great Void with Primordial Darkness and boundless vastness. Hence it is said to be vast and without light.

This describes the transition from the Yan Kang of the previous kalpa to the beginning of the Dragon Han of the present kalpa, when the Two Modes had not yet emerged, and chaos was undivided, with the Brahma-qi flowing through the void. Next comes the era of Red Brightness unfolding its destiny, as detailed below.

The Chart of Red Brightness unfolds; the kalpic reckoning proceeds naturally.

Dong states: "Red" signifies fire, the qi of the Primordial Beginning’s ninefold refinement.

"Opening" means to initiate; "chart" means image. Within the Yan Kang kalpa, the Primordial Beginning initiated the era of Red Brightness. Thereupon, in the Chanli world, the Most High and Great Sagely Jade Emperor refined the True Script with fire, causing radiant light to emerge, jade essence to flow, and forming the Cavernous Yang Palace. All things took form, and it was named Red Brightness.

Master Youxi states: At this time, the Red Script of True Text unfolded the brilliance of its chart and register, setting in motion the division and measure of yin and yang. Heaven thereby illumined the Three Luminaries, and earth thereby gave birth to the myriad things. Thus we know that heaven and earth have their cycles of formation and decay, not merely the initial unfolding of creation at this time. Thereafter, the four seasons succeeded one another, and the myriad transformations nurtured and reared—yet none knew their source, hence it is called "natural." For this reason, it was named the kalpa of Red Brightness.

Master Shaowei states: From this point onward, the kalpic reckoning of the Bright Era was to be fulfilled. The True Script refined by fire was thus named Red Brightness; the progression of kalpic measure followed the principle of naturalness.

Master Xuanying states: This clarifies the initial unfolding of the kalpic reckoning, succeeding the era of Dragon Han, when the cosmos was arrayed and the governance of the Three Luminaries established. "Red Brightness" refers to the True Script of the Jade Calendar from before. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy refined it with fire, and the True Script, luminous and crimson in hue, was thus named Red Brightness. With this True Script, heaven and earth were arrayed, the transformations of qian and kun were set in motion, and the Three Luminaries followed their constant measure—each according with the principle of naturalness, not the work of artificial craft. "Reckoning" means movement; "measure" means number. The *Red Script* states: The kalpic reckoning completes a full cycle of day and night in thirty days, forming one conjunction; twelve conjunctions make one degree. Three thousand three hundred degrees constitute a minor kalpa, and nine thousand nine hundred degrees a major kalpa. The *Chapter on the Generation of Spirits* further states: One degree corresponds to one year. The Primordial Beginning established and guarded the fivefold scriptures, spreading and placing them throughout.

Master Dong states: "Established" means to set up; "guarded" means to preserve; "spread" means to distribute; "placed" means to position. The fivefold scriptures are the jade characters of the Red Script.

Master Youxi states: "Spread" means to extend; "placed" means to expand. Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning, with the jade characters of the Red Script, extended the True Text, establishing the root of heaven and guarding the source of earth. He spread and placed the colored positions of the five directions, molding and casting the implements of yin and yang, extending the transformations of the Primordial Beginning—nothing was left unprepared. The jade characters of the Red Script are the Eight Might Dragon Script.

Master Dong states: Once the True Text received refinement by fire, it was named the *Red Script*. The *Eight Might* refers to the Eight Might Jade Tablets; the *Dragon Script* is the script for summoning dragons. The Primordial Beginning established the Five Marchmounts, arranged the fivefold scriptures, and stationed the True Text in the five directions, with the Five Emperors guarding them. He regulated spirits and summoned dragons to avert the appointed time of kalpic reckoning.

Master Youxi states: The *Red Script* is the fivefold True Text. The jade characters are the innate inner sounds. The Eight Might Dragon Script and the like are true talismans transmitted to the highest perfected. They regulate the kalpic reckoning, ensuring the heavens endure long.

Master Dong states: The Primordial Beginning established and guarded the Five Marchmounts, founding the roots of heaven and earth to repel all disasters; he regulated spirits and summoned dragons to extend the kalpic reckoning. Heaven, though high, does not topple; earth, though heavy, does not sink. From beginning to end, all stands firm—thus it endures long.

Master Youxi states: This Red Script, true talismans, and dragon scripts all serve to regulate and govern the kalpic reckoning, dispelling its adversities and endings, ensuring heaven and earth endure long without collapse.

Master Shaowei states: The *Red Script* is the fivefold True Text. The *Jade Characters* are the numinous writings of the Eight Assemblies and the Eight Might Jade Tablets. They command the might of eight kinds of beings, hence the name. The *Dragon Script* is the script for summoning dragons. At the outset of the Primordial Beginning’s practice of the Dao, he established the Red Script in the five directions, distributed the jade characters across the thirty-six heavens, employed the jade tablets to command the myriad spirits with might, and used the dragon scripts to summon dragons and safeguard the kalpa—thus heaven endures long without collapse.

The Brahma-qi pervaded and encompassed all, and the myriad patterns unfolded.

Master Dong states: "Brahma" refers to the qi of the Great Brahma. "Pervaded and encompassed" means to embrace all. "Pattern" means form. The Primordial Beginning raised the qi of the Great Brahma, initiating the era of Red Brightness, and heaven, earth, and the myriad things all received form at once.

Master Youxi states: Once the Primordial Beginning had established the two images and spread the fivefold scriptures, and further employed the jade characters and dragon scripts to regulate the kalpic reckoning, he then distributed the true Brahma-qi throughout the ten directions and unfolded the mysterious transformative script across the cosmos—thus all kinds under heaven arose in unison, touching all things.

Master Shaowei states: The Brahma-qi spread and filled all, molding and casting the myriad forms—curved and straight, square and round—each with its own pattern. The Primordial Net flowed and extended through the thirty-two heavens.

Master Dong states: The "Primordial Net" refers to the guiding principles of the Primordial qi, spreading through the thirty-two heavens.

Master Youxi states: "Primordial" refers to the stars; "net" refers to the stellar net. Once the Two Modes became bright and clear, and the Three Luminaries shone together, the stars arrayed themselves in flowing motion, illuminating the thirty-two heavens above; the sun and moon alternated in brightness, illuminating the hundred million worlds below.

Master Shaowei states: "Primordial" means great; "extended" means to spread. The Brahma-qi serves as the great guiding principle for the myriad things, flowing and spreading through the thirty-two realms. It revolves without form, circling through the ten directions.

Master Dong states: "Without form" means without shape. "Ten directions" refers to the eight directions plus above and below, making ten. The qi of the Great Brahma spreads everywhere without exception.

Master Youxi states: Its wheeling light illumines the Three Realms, circling and shining through the ten directions—thus no darkness remains unlit, and all things are illuminated. "Without form" refers to the realm above the Three Realms.

The Dipper revolved and the Winnowing Basket traversed.

Master Xuanying states: "Revolved the Dipper" means the name for turning; the Dipper and Winnowing Basket are star names among the twenty-eight lunar lodges.

The Dipper star resides in the northeast above the northern quadrant. "Traversing the Winnowing Basket" means *li* (历) as in "to tread." The Winnowing Basket star lies in the northwest above the eastern quadrant, hence the annotation: "The Dipper and Winnowing Basket stars flank the northeast corner." This clarifies how the qi of the Great Brahma flows and spreads, arising from the Whirlwind Terrace in the northeast corner. Its qi spirals upward like ram’s horns, moving leftward from the east toward the south, first passing through the Winnowing Basket star—thus called "traversing the Winnowing Basket." From the south it turns west, from the west it turns north, crossing through the Jiaoyi and Huangzeng heavens, then circling back eastward, passing through the Dipper star, and returning to the Whirlwind Terrace. This marks one full revolution of the Brahma qi through the heavens, nurturing the myriad things and accomplishing the work of a year—hence "revolving the Dipper and traversing the Winnowing Basket." The annotation states: The Jiaoyi Heaven lies to the left of the Horn star. The Horn star is positioned in the east, while the Jiaoyi Heaven is in the west; the Brahma qi moves leftward from east to west into the Jiaoyi. Jiaoyi is the supreme position among the thirty-two heavens, thus said to be "to the left of the Horn." Huangzeng lies to its right: Huangzeng is the first position among the thirty-two heavens, situated to the right of the Winnowing Basket star, thus marking the beginning of the Winnowing Basket’s domain. "Beginning of the Winnowing Basket" means the Brahma qi commences its movement from the Winnowing Basket star—hence "beginning of the Winnowing Basket." The meaning of "revolving the Dipper and traversing the Winnowing Basket" is roughly as such.

It revolves and measures the Five Constants.
Master Dong states: The Dipper is the Northern Dipper. The Winnowing Basket is the Winnowing Basket lodge. "Revolves and measures" means to circulate and guide. The Five Constants are the Five Phases. This refers to the natural qi circulating and guiding the Five Phases.
Master Youxi states: It turns the seven luminaries in the northern quadrant, following the sun and time with the Dipper’s handle pointing, traversing the revolutions of the Winnowing Basket and Net lodges, weaving through the measures of the Five Constants. The Five Constants are the five planets. The Winnowing Basket and Net are among the twenty-eight lunar lodges.
Master Xuanying states: This clarifies how the Brahma qi flows and spreads, coiling through the thirty-two heavens, revolving and circulating the qi of the Five Constants—thus the four seasons follow in order, transforming and generating life. The Five Constants are the Five Phases: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. If arranged sequentially, wood belongs to the east, fire to the south, earth to the central palace, metal to the west, and water to the north. These Five Phases, in generating and completing the myriad things, all depend on the work of the Brahma qi, forming the constant Dao of heaven and earth—hence "revolving and measuring the Five Constants."

Thirty-five divisions, the primordial qi unites in the Upper Origin.
Master Dong states: The thirty-five divisions refer to the thirty-five heavens. "Divisions" means domains; "unites" means to govern. *Qi* is the primordial qi of the Origin. The Upper Origin is the supreme, luminous, and formless Dao of the Origin, governing all immortals, encompassing heaven and earth, dividing yin and yang, circulating the Five Phases, bestowing positions upon the heavens. Once the Three Images were separated and the nine-tiered terrace shone forth in brilliance, it abided on the Jade Capital Mountain, resplendent above the Dark Metropolis. Flying immortals perpetually scatter incense of a hundred harmonies and stream the blossoms of five clouds to bathe the perfected ones. Upon the terrace stands the Great Perfected Jade Youth, thrice daily unfurling the Ten Absolute Banners. With each full circuit, all heavens ascend to pay homage, circling the terrace thrice while reciting and chanting the cavernous scriptures. The thirty-two heavens are arrayed in the four directions, eight heavens to each direction, totaling thirty-two. Three heavens enclose them above, and above the Great Enclosure all is empty and vast, where five natural mists gather, their color azure-yellow, called the Yellow Heaven. Above the Yellow Heaven, its hue deep blue, is called the Azure Heaven. Above the Azure Heaven lies the Dark Void, where accumulated emptiness forms a green hue, called the Green Heaven. Altogether there are thirty-five heavens, each with its own domain, all governed by the primordial qi of the Origin and the supreme Dao—hence "the primordial qi unites in the Upper Origin."

The thirty-five divisions refer to the thirty-five stars.
Master Youxi states: The thirty-five divisions are the sun, moon, five planets, and twenty-eight lodges combined, totaling thirty-five. However, the twenty-eight lodges each comprise multiple stars, and the sun and moon are not stellar in nature, so they cannot be called thirty-five stars—thus termed thirty-five divisions. "Divisions" means positions, all receiving the qi of the Upper Origin. The Upper Origin is the source from which all are endowed.
Master Shaowei states: The Dipper and Winnowing Basket stars flank the northeast corner. The Jiaoyi Heaven lies to the left of the Horn, marking the domain where the Dipper revolves. The Huangzeng Heaven lies to the right of the Horn, marking the domain where the Winnowing Basket begins. The Brahma qi first arises from the Whirlwind Terrace in the northeast, spiraling upward like ram’s horns, circling leftward and rightward, traversing the Winnowing Basket and revolving the Dipper to complete its course. Coiling through the thirty-two heavens and revolving the qi of the Five Constants, the four seasons transform, and the myriad things take form. The *Taiyi Yijue* states: "Incense smoke arises naturally, the dark steps ascend the whirlwind." This describes the Brahma qi emerging from the Whirlwind Terrace like incense smoke.
Master Xuanying states: The thirty-five divisions are the boundaries of the thirty-five heavens. The Three Realms contain twenty-eight heavens, and the Northern Dipper’s seven stars each govern a heaven, making thirty-five heavens. The Northern Dipper’s Yang Brightness, Yin Essence, Cinnabar Prime, and North Culmen stars govern four heavens of the seed people. The Dark Obscurity, Perfected One, and Celestial Pass stars govern the three highest heavens, totaling thirty-five heavens. The three highest heavens are the Jade Clarity, Upper Clarity, and Grand Clarity. Another account holds that the Three Terraces’ three stars govern the three highest heavens, together with the preceding thirty-two heavens, forming the thirty-five heavenly divisions. "The primordial qi unites in the Upper Origin" means the Upper Origin is the Supreme Jade Clarity Dark Metropolis. It clarifies how the Brahma qi flows and spreads, revolving the Dipper and traversing the Winnowing Basket, pervading all thirty-five heavens.

Its qi ascends into the Upper Clarity Heaven, converging entirely within the precincts of the Dark Metropolis—hence it is called "the primordial qi unites in the Upper Origin." The Eight Effulgences merge in darkness, and qi enters the Profound Profundity.

The Eastern Master says: "The Eight Effulgences are eight colors. 'Merge in darkness' means penetrating the body with the qi of the Dao." "Profound Profundity" signifies the abstruse and recondite.

The Most High Dao Lord rides the jade chariot of the Eight Effulgences, urging the three-pure flying clouds, ascending above the Dark Metropolis and the Six Harmonies Terrace. He discloses the arcana of the Primordial Beginning and expounds the Great Dharma to deliver humankind. When qi reaches the subtlest mystery, the body of the Dao becomes spontaneous.

Master Youxi says: "In sum, they are called the Eight Effulgences. The twenty-eight lunar lodges are arrayed in the four directions, seven stars to each quarter. The lodges of the four directions, together with the sun, moon, five planets, and Northern Dipper, combine to form the eight effulgent qi, which naturally merge in darkness. The merged effulgent qi all enter the Profound Profundity. This 'Profound Profundity' is the Profound of the Upper Origin. Having first received the qi of the Upper Origin, the qi then returns to enter the Profound. The Profound is where the qi of above and below interflow, so the radiance of the numinous stream never ceases."

Master Shaowei says: "If one attains the Dao, the spirits of the Three Passages and Eight Effulgences merge indistinguishably, jointly raising the adept’s body to ascend above the layered heavens. 'Profound Profundity' refers to the heavens beyond heavens."

Master Xuanying says: "The Eight Effulgences are effulgent lights. The Upper Origin’s primordial qi forms one effulgence, and the seven luminaries combine to make eight. The seven luminaries are the sun, moon, and five planets. 'Merge in darkness' means that these eight entities, their lights and effulgences merging indistinguishably, illumine the myriad heavens—hence it is called 'merge in darkness.' Another explanation holds that the Eight Effulgences are the eight colors of the heavenly lights. 'Qi enters the Profound Profundity' means that the preceding Great Brahma qi, revolving and circulating, ascends into the Most High Heaven—hence it is called 'qi enters the Profound Profundity.' 'Profound Profundity' describes the boundless and infinite height. If a worldly person attains the Dao, the spirits of the Eight Effulgences jointly raise the adept’s body to ascend above the layered heavens. The 'layered heavens' are the heavens above the heavens of the various heavens, that is, the precincts of the Upper Clarity Dark Metropolis."

Within the Profound dwells the Grand August, the Celestial Emperor, and the Lofty Perfected.

The Eastern Master says: "The Grand August is named Yi Miao, who has come from the Dragon Han and emerged in the Crimson Brightness. He abides amid the primordial opening, within the void, roaming the vast expanse, dwelling in the silent court. His divine effulgence and jade splendor stand as the standard of the myriad Dao."

Master Youxi says: "The preceding 'Profound Profundity' is the Supreme Profound within the Profound. Here, 'within the Profound' refers to the realm of the Two Voids and Three Precincts. The Two Voids are the Great Void and the Hollow Void. The Three Precincts are Jade Clarity, Upper Clarity, and Grand Ultimate. The Grand August dwells in Jade Clarity, the Celestial Emperor in Upper Clarity, and the Lofty Perfected in the Grand Ultimate. Whenever one is called 'August,' it is a title of the Celestial Worthy, equal in rank to the Primordial Beginning—examples include the Supreme August, Lofty August, Void August, and Jade August. The Celestial Emperor is the Lord of the Grand Tenuity, the most exalted of the thirty-six celestial emperors. The Lofty Perfected is the most exalted title of the Yellow Elder of the Central Grand Ultimate."

Their effulgences drift upon the grand auroras, and they chant the cavernous chapters.

The Eastern Master says: "To 'drift upon effulgences' means to roam and soar. The 'grand auroras' are qi. They fly upon the mysterious qi and recite the cavernous scriptures, harmonizing with the qi of spontaneity to deliver those who study the Dao."

Master Youxi says: "To 'drift' means to float. 'Effulgences' means bodies. This describes the movements of these Three Worthies: they soar their bodies amid the clouds, drifting upon effulgences in the empyrean, and when they open their mouths, they intone the verses of the cavernous chapters and chant the lofty scriptures. The 'cavernous chapters' are the chapters of the Great Cavern; the 'lofty scriptures' are also names of chapters within the cavernous scriptures."

Master Shaowei says: "The Grand August is the Void August Dao Lord. The Celestial Emperor is the Celestial Emperor of the Golden Portal. The Lofty Perfected is the third-rank perfected. In the Upper Clarity Heaven stands the mountain of Void Effulgence, where the qi of grand auroras abides. The Void August Celestial Emperor and this Lofty Perfected ride the jade chariot of the Eight Effulgences, flying above the grand auroras, chanting the cavernous scriptures to receive adepts."

Golden perfection shines resplendently, its echoes flowing through the cloud encampments.

The Eastern Master says: "The 'golden perfection' is the spontaneous scripture. The divine beings of the Brahma Heaven fly and roam above the Grand Ultimate, singing the boundless celestial hymns. They stir the numinous winds of the spirit, wafting and spreading the melodies of the cavernous chapters. The Jade Maidens of Grand Harmony at the Gate of the Flowery Metropolis harmonize with the divine beings’ songs, their echoes flowing through the palaces of auspicious clouds—hence it is called 'cloud encampments.'"

Master Youxi says: "The 'golden perfection' is the golden perfection of jade light, which is the effulgence of the Celestial Worthy’s body. 'Resplendently' describes the radiance. 'Encampments' means congealing and gathering. Since they drift upon the grand auroras, the golden perfection shines brilliantly, and they intone the verses of the cavernous chapters amid the coalescing clouds and mist."

Master Shaowei says: "The 'golden perfection' is the golden-slip perfection scripture. Long ago, the perfection scripture first appeared, coalescing in the mysterious void, gleaming with radiance and inscribed upon golden slips—hence it is called 'shining resplendently.' The 'cloud encampments' are the cloud palaces. The Hundred Jade Countenance Hall stands upon Dragon Mountain in the Dark Metropolis. It speaks of the Celestial Emperor chanting the golden slips, his pure voice resonant and bright, flowing into the cloud palaces."

Master Xuanying says: "The 'golden perfection' is the perfection scripture inscribed upon gold. 'Shining' means the scripture’s characters are bright and clear. 'Resplendently' describes the brilliance. The 'cloud encampments' are the name of the Hundred Jade Countenance Hall within the Dark Metropolis, which stands upon Dragon Mound Mountain. 'Flowing echoes' clarifies that when the host of sages chant, their voices resound through the cloud encampment palaces—hence it is called 'flowing echoes through the cloud encampments.'"

The jade tones gather qi, and the numinous winds assemble mist.

The Eastern Master says: "The 'jade tones' are the jade-light scriptures. The flying divine beings of heaven constantly ride the azure auroras’ brushes, soaring through the Jade Exaltation Heaven."

At the three daily hours, the great sages of heaven are led to ascend and pay court at the Seven Treasures Palace. The Heavenly Kings offer their rejoicing, striking jade chimes and sounding the dawn. With a single cry from the attendant of the morning, the numinous winds gather the mist.

Once the numinous winds stir, their tones form the Cavern Scripture.

Master Youqi says: "The 'jade tones' are the chanting voices of the Supreme August High Perfected. When the Supreme August chants, the jade tones crown the heavens to gather qi, and the numinous winds arise from the void to assemble the mist."

The Purple Void flourishes in radiance, aiding and sheltering the myriad immortals.

The Eastern Master says: "The 'Purple Void' is the Purple Tenuity Palace. 'Flourishing' means vigorous; 'radiance' means emerging. The Purple Tenuity’s halls flourish and emerge above the Jade Clarity Heaven. Within it lies the Sarana Palace, where those newly attained to the Numinous Treasure reside—countless multitudes. Their merits not yet complete, they remain dispersed therein. When the kalpa’s turn arrives, the throngs of Mount Tu assess the weight of their merits and ascend to the Vermilion Numinosity Palace to receive blessings and rise as immortals, thereafter becoming perfected transcendents."

Master Youqi says: "The Middle Origin of the Jade Clarity Heaven is named the Purple Clarity, hence it is also called the Purple Void. Though these three honored ones each serve as the origin of a single realm, all belong to the ranks of the Jade Clarity. Moreover, the Perfected of the Dao all ascend to the Jade Clarity. The Purple Void’s palace naturally flourishes in radiance, and with the myriad immortals’ luminous wings, it enhances the brilliance of the host of sages."

Master Shaowei says: "The 'Purple Void' is the Purple Tenuity Palace, also named the Sarana Palace. Its halls are majestic and flourishing. Within dwell the throngs of Mount Tu—countless multitudes, all newly attained. As the time of destiny has not yet arrived, they remain dispersed therein. When the kalpa’s turn comes, the Three Divisions, Eight Effulgences, and Twenty-Four Perfected will assist and aid them, ascending to the Southern Palace to receive their immortality."

A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally perfected as true.

The Eastern Master says: "'Harmony' means dissolution; 'union' means gathering. Since the Perfected began their cultivation, they have passed through countless kalpas, dissolving forms and altering bodies, relinquishing one vessel to receive another, revolving with the kalpa’s cycles. From the coarse they enter the subtle, tempered by the jade gaze, and only then do they become true."

Master Youqi says: "If the practitioner of recitation harmonizes with a thousand Perfected and unites with ten thousand Dao-qi, the true merges with the spirit, the body of the Dao unites with qi, and naturally they become true."

Master Shaowei says: "Those who ascend all establish three thousand virtuous deeds, with the ten thousand practices perfected. Only then do the Three Bureaus review their records, allowing them to ascend to the Southern Palace. Nourished by the Great Harmony, tempered by the jade nectar, they pass through harmonies and unions, and only then do they become true."

Within the true resides the spirit—the Great Lord of Longevity.

The Eastern Master says: "Within the Longevity Palace dwells the Lord of Longevity."

Master Youqi says: "Having united with the true, the body contains the true, and within the true resides the spirit—this Great Lord and the subsequent deities are such."

The Great Lord resides in the Life Gate Palace below the navel, also called the Hall of Brightness.

Master Shaowei says: "This speaks of the original spirit of the attainer. 'Within the true' refers to the Southern Perfected Palace. The 'Great Lord of Longevity' is the Lord of Life Extension, whose name is Xu Yuan, who presides over the preservation of the decaying body."

The Lordless Duke and the White Prime Honored Spirit.

The Eastern Master says: "The Left Lordless is named Duke; the Right White Prime is named Dongyang. They are called the Specialized Spirits."

Master Youqi says: "The Lordless and White Prime are the names of two spirits, both dwelling in the Cavern Chamber Palace. The palace lies two inches directly within the space between the brows. The Lordless also resides in the liver at times, also called Duke. The White Prime also resides in the lungs at times. 'Honored Spirit' is an emphatic reference to the White Prime, not a separate title."

The Great One, Controller of Destiny, and the Peach Prosperity and Union Longevity.

The Eastern Master says: "The Great One is named Wu You Shou; the Controller of Destiny is the Celestial Controller of Destiny, named Li Ming Chu. Peach Prosperity is the spirit of the Life Gate."

Master Youqi says: "The Great One is also the Great Lord. The Great Lord is the honored one among the hundred spirits of the body and the master of the ten thousand qi, hence called the Great One, also named the Great Lord. The 'Controller of Destiny' governs life, also called the Controller of Destiny. The two spirits Peach Prosperity and Union Longevity share names with the Great Lord, but this is an interchangeable reference, not strictly accurate."

Master Shaowei says: "The Great One is named Wu You Shou; the Controller of Destiny is named Xuan Du Qing; the Peach Lord is named Hui Hai; the Prosperity Lord is named Jing Yan."

Master Xuanying says: "The Great One governs all offices as the master of the host of spirits. The Controller of Destiny and other Perfected officials are all positions within the Southern Ascension of the Attainer’s bureaucracy."

Holding talismans and grasping registers, they preserve life and root its origin.

The Eastern Master says: "The Duke holds the talisman; the Controller of Destiny grasps the register. The Great One subdues demons, and with the Cavern Scripture, they ascend the attainer to the Longevity Palace."

Master Youqi says: "The Great Lord constantly holds the eight talismans to preserve human life and root its origin."

Master Xuanying says: "This clarifies that when the attainer achieves the Dao, the Duke is commanded to hold the talisman of the Primordial Beginning’s Ascension of the Attainer; the Controller of Destiny’s palace grasps the register of the attainer’s name; the Great One governs the restraint of the host of demons. Together, they elevate the practitioner, preserving life and rooting its origin."

Ascending to the Upper Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Chambers.

The Eastern Master says: "The 'Upper Clarity' is the Purple Tenuity Palace."

The Purple Tenuity resides above the Jade Clarity. The "Flowery Chambers" are the Supreme Ultimate Palace, which has the Azure Flower Gate, and within lies the Curved Chambers.

Master Youqi says: "These spirits originally dwell among the gods of the Upper Clarity’s Great Tenuity Palace. They divide and descend their qi, entering the human body, thus at times ascending back to the Upper Clarity, exiting and entering the Flowery Chambers—the chambers of the Great Tenuity. Within the Eight Darknesses, amid the subtlest of the subtle."

The Eastern Master says: "The 'Eight Darknesses' are the Eight Poles. The 'subtlest of the subtle' refers to the tip of a hair. This speaks of advancing beyond the Eight Poles and within the tip of a hair."

Master Youqi says: "The 'Eight Darknesses' lie beyond the Eight Poles, obscure and unfathomable—hence called the Eight Darknesses. These spirits are so vast that nothing lies beyond them, so minute that nothing lies within them. They may expand throughout the Eight Darknesses or penetrate the tip of a single hair. In humans, they become the Dao; in things, they become life—the qi of the Dao-nature. Below, they guard the human body, settling in the Mud-Pill Palace and the Crimson Palace."

The Eastern Master says: "The Mud-Pill is the brain. The Crimson Palace is the heart. The Heavenly Venerable resides in the Upper Clarity Palace, known as the Great One Lord. Below, within the human body, he becomes the Lord of the Mud-Pill. As the *Scripture of Unfolding the Scripture and Treasuring the Incantation* states: 'Though the Heavenly Venerable is distant and wondrous, he is near through the Lord of the Mud-Pill.' This is what it means."

Master Youqi says: "This clarifies how they guard within the human body, some in the Mud-Pill, others in the Crimson Palace. The Mud-Pill lies three inches inward from the space between the eyebrows; the Crimson Palace is the heart. They regulate the Five Qi and harmonize the Hundred Spirits."

The Eastern Master says: "The Five Qi are the qi of the Five Viscera. The Hundred Spirits are the Hundred Passes. 'Harmonize' means to blend, to regulate the Hundred Passes and unite the spirit and qi."

Master Shaowei says: "The Flowery Chambers are the Three Flowery Chambers of the Jade Clarity. The Eight Darknesses are the Eight Poles. The 'subtlest of the subtle' refers to the tip of a hair. The Mud-Pill is the brain; the Crimson Palace is the heart. These true spirits, with the Great One as their master, roam the Three Clarities, exiting and entering the Three Flowery Chambers, circling within the Eight Poles, and pervading the tips of hairs. When they guard the human body, the Great One resides in the brain, governing all spirits; the Controller of Destiny dwells in the heart, receiving the origin of life. The Non-Beginning is in the liver, governing the Three Hun; the White Prime is in the lungs, restraining the Seven Po. The Peach Lord resides in the navel, preserving the root of essence; the Extending Health dwells in the kidneys, guarding the Gate of Life. Within the Hollow Cavern, they regulate the qi, harmonize the Hundred Spirits, manifest auspicious numinous texts, and in accordance with the kalpas, deliver people. As the *Book of Changes* states: 'The spirit has no direction; the Changes have no form—this is what is meant by the unfathomability of yin and yang.' Thus, the spirit is nowhere absent, and wherever it is, it is nowhere. It cannot be known by wisdom, nor can it be defined by being or non-being. Some hold that within the human body, each has these spirits. Upon examining the various scriptures, the principles are not uniform.

According to the *Heavenly Elder’s Secret Prognostication*: 'Among spirits, there are ranks of honor, and the Great One is the most noble. Above, it guards the Three Clarities; below, it roams the Nine Palaces.' The *Cavern Spirit Scripture* states: 'The Great One is named Wu You Shou, styled Gui Hui Chang, and governs all heavens and earths—its spirit is the most revered. Its form is black above and red below, and it wears the Heaven-Piercing Crown, its eyes gazing straight ahead. If one constantly contemplates it, one will attain long life and never die.'

The *Jade Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: 'The Controller of Destiny receives the Emperor’s writ and is titled the Dark Deliverance Minister. Its form is white above and blue below, with a perfectly round face.'

The *Record of the Three Primes of the Cavern Spirit* states: 'The Three Prime Lords are the Three Prime Lords of the Great Simplicity. One is a woman whose head has three cloud-like topknots, with the rest of her hair hanging loose to her waist. She wears a floating-morning crown and robes, a purple floating-cloud brocade sash at her waist, and a nine-colored dragon brocade feathered skirt, with a belt bearing flowing-gold fire bells and tiger talismans. Beneath her knees, she emits red, green, and blue qi. The Three Prime Lords give birth to the Three Simplicity Prime Lords: the eldest daughter, the Purple Simplicity Prime Lord, gives birth to the Non-Beginning; the middle daughter, the Yellow Simplicity Prime Lord, gives birth to the Yellow Elder; the youngest daughter, the White Simplicity Prime Lord, gives birth to the White Prime. The Yellow Elder, White Prime, and Non-Beginning are called the Three Prime Emperor Lords. The mother of the Emperor Lords is called the Three Simplicity Prime Lords—these are the Three Prime Lords. After years of devoted practice and austerities, the Three Primes descend to the chambers, and the Three Simplicity Jade Maidens arrive first. If one studies the Dao without knowing the Three Primes, one’s cultivation will be ineffective. These Three Primes are all natural spirits, born together with the Primordial Beginning. When ten thousand people together invoke the true qi, each has its corresponding spirit.'

Ten revolutions return the numinous; the myriad qi ascend as immortals.

The Eastern Master says: "The 'myriad qi' are the myriad spirits. When the Lord of the Mud-Pill recites the scripture ten times, all spirits ascend as immortals. The Three Offices and Six Palaces, along with all the spirit-officials, each lead their hosts of a hundred million chariots and ten thousand riders, transforming in majestic splendor, with grand processions of cloud-riding and dragon-mounted escorts. Together, they elevate the human body, and all the hundred officials and spirit-officials likewise ascend as immortals."

Master Youqi says: "The 'ten revolutions' refer to the ten revolutions of the Heavenly Pass. When one person attains the Dao, the Heavenly Pass revolves ten times, returning the hundred spirits to complete the nature and transforming the myriad qi to ascend together as immortals."

Master Shaowei says: "Gathering those seven spirits, they compassionately pity the multitudes, revolving through the ten directions to deliver living beings, desiring that the myriad qi flow and all attain the immortal Dao. The immortal Dao values life and delivers boundlessly."

The Eastern Master says: "The 'boundless' refers to the revered gods among the hosts of great sages. In the heavens, there are boundless hosts of great sages, all governing the flying immortals of the ten directions, who receive their ranks and ascend accordingly. The 'deliverers of people' are the flying immortal spirits. At the first crow of the rooster, they ascend to the Jade Terrace above and the Immortal Hall within, gathering the essence of the five-directional cloud sprouts and reverently swallowing the light of the sun, moon, and three luminaries. They constantly review the registers of life and death of those who study immortality, deliver the souls of the Nine Dark Regions, and raise them into the Gate of the Dharma Wheel."

Those who study this method can spur the divine wind to swift as smoke, ascending to the work of the soaring forest, so that the seven ancestors emerge from the palace of the eternal night and ascend to the palace of renewed life.

The Lesser Florescence says: "What the immortal Dao values lies solely in life. Thus, the boundless deliverance of people cannot be reckoned."

Above, the Eight Gates open—the Dharma Wheel of the flying immortals.
Sin and blessing, prohibitions and admonitions, past lives and karmic conditions.

The Eastern Master says: "The Eight Gates are the eight directional gates of the Dharma Wheel in heaven. Within them lies the realm of sin and blessing. The Most High Dao Lord opens the Eight Gates to deliver the souls of those who study the Dao from life and death. Thus, it is called the Dharma Wheel."

The Recluse of the Dark Abode says: "Once one attains deliverance in life, the Demon King opens the Eight Gates of the Dharma Wheel to deliver them. The student then naturally ascends, unbound by the gates of heaven."

The Lesser Florescence says: "The Eight Gates of sin and blessing are governed by the flying immortals. Thus, it is called the Dharma Wheel of the flying immortals. The Dao Lord questions sin and blessing at the Eight Gates, while the flying immortals recount past lives and explain the roots of karmic conditions, all of which are detailed in the *Dharma Wheel Sutra*."

Universally receiving deliverance, the dead soul revives in a living body.

The Eastern Master says: "The Dharma Wheel’s gates are the realm of sin and blessing, each with its prohibitions. The origins of sin and blessing are all recorded in the *Dharma Wheel Sutra*. The Most High Dao Lord, in his great compassion, extricates the souls bound by past karmic debts from hell, examines their sins, then pardons and releases them, allowing them to enter the Dharma Wheel’s gates. They ride the chariot of the Eight Effulgences, ascend to the Jade Purity, and pay homage at the Purple Tenuity Palace, attaining the rank of honored guests among the sagely hosts—this is what is meant by the dead soul reviving in a living body."

The Recluse of the Dark Abode says: "The seven ancestors gave rise to this one body, fostering these five karmic deeds. Now that this body has received deliverance, the five deeds naturally vanish, and the seven ancestors refine and transform to be reborn. The five deeds fall away rootless. Thus, it is said that all universally receive deliverance, looking up to bear the grace of liberation. The body attains rebirth and is heard above by the various heavens."

The Eastern Master says: "Heard means opened. The body attains rebirth and opens the various heavens above. Above the various heavens, each has its Gate of Life."

The Eastern Master says: "Within the Eight Gates, each has its Gate of Rebirth."

The Recluse of the Dark Abode says: "Once the living body receives deliverance and the dead soul is reborn, the Three Realms and Five Emperors ascend to serve the various heavens. Above the various heavens, they are recorded in the register of life. Thus, it is said that each has its Gate of Life."

The Lesser Florescence says: "When the dead soul is reborn, it is reported to the various heavens. Above the various heavens, each has its Gate of Rebirth. Then the Three Offices review and record them, assigning them to their destined places of rebirth. Within these are the hymns of the Empty Cavern, the numinous chapters of the Demon King, and verses that match the lofty perfected ones."

The Eastern Master says: "The Empty Cavern refers to the Three Realms—all is empty within the Three Realms. The Demon King is Mara, who dwells within the Three Realms, singing wanton songs and verses that disrupt the human heart. The numinous youths turn the locks of the Eight Gates, and the assembled perfected ones ascend to pay homage. At a single resonant chant, the Demon King is bound. Those who recite the numinous verses have their names inscribed in the Dharma Wheel of the Purple Tenuity Palace, listed in the registers of the Life-Commanding Office. They awaken, deliver souls, and ascend to the palace of renewed life."

The Recluse of the Dark Abode says: "Once the Demon King has safeguarded and escorted them above the various heavens, there are hymns sung within those heavens. Their verses align with the lofty perfected ones, resonating with the principle of the Empty Cavern. Reciting them leads to immortal ascension—thus, they are called the numinous chapters."

The Lesser Florescence says: "Within the Three Realms, above the Empty Cavern, the Demon King submits and transforms, singing hymns. The numinous chapters and virtuous verses harmonize with the true sages."

The first is the Desire Realm, the sound of flying through emptiness.

The Eastern Master says: "The Desire Realm extends from the Yellow and Growing Heaven to the Six Heavens of the Upper Brightness and the Seven Luminaries of Māyā—this is the domain of the Desire Realm. Within it dwells the Demon King named Yu Mo, who sings the song of flying through emptiness."

The Recluse of the Dark Abode says: "The first is the Desire Realm, the lower realm. It refers to the world above this one, hence it is called the first. Desire means attachment. Realm means boundary. The Desire Realm has six heavens, where the people of these heavens have form and desire, clinging to things and becoming attached—thus, it is called the Desire Realm. The Demon King sings this hymn within the empty mystery of this realm—thus, it is called the sound of flying through emptiness."

The Lesser Florescence says: "The Daoist scriptures state: If a person’s oral karma is pure and they accumulate ten virtuous deeds, they may ascend to the heavens of the Desire Realm. The human realm is minute and fragmented; the immortal Dao is vast and obscure."

The Eastern Master says: "Minute and fragmented refers to the multitude of petty beings. Vast and obscure means dark and indistinct. The human realm exists among the petty, making success difficult. The immortal Dao is vast and obscure, difficult to comprehend—it cannot be seen. Thus, it is called vast and obscure."

The Recluse of the Dark Abode says: "Slight of eye is called minute—visible yet distant. Vast and boundless is called obscure—profound and unfathomable. The human realm cannot be governed by distant effort; the immortal Dao is dark and motionless, yet easily thwarted. The ghostly realm is joyful, facing the Gate of Human Life."

The Eastern Master says: "Joyful means delight. The Gate of Life is the life-gate of the Three Realms. The ghostly realm lies within the Three Realms, leading ghostly soldiers to obstruct human lives, wantonly killing people for their delight."

The Recluse of the Dark Abode says: "The ghostly realm indulges the heart’s desires, following its nature and the world’s ways—thus, it is called joyful. This is the path to death, where life is daily lost. Life and death stand as opposing gates—thus, it is said to face the Gate of Human Life."

The Lesser Florescence says: "The ghostly realm delights in killing, acting violently in groups, constantly obstructing the Gate of Human Life. The Gate of Life is the gate of rebirth in the Three Realms. The heavenly Dao values life; the ghostly realm values death."

The Eastern Master says: "Values means favors. The heavenly Dao favors life; the ghostly realm favors killing."

The Recluse of the Dark Abode says: "The Dao of divine immortals lies in long life and enduring vision, abiding in serene perpetuity. The Dao of malevolent ghosts, however, seeks to draw humans into the Great Yin, all ending in annihilation. The immortal Dao is ever auspicious; the ghostly Dao is ever inauspicious."

The Eastern Master says: "Those who favor life are auspicious; those who favor killing are inauspicious."

The Recluse of the Dark Abode says: "Since the immortal Dao is life, auspicious omens arise of themselves. Since the ghostly Dao is death, calamities respond of themselves."

The Lesser Florescence says: "The human realm lies below the Three Realms. The immortal Dao lies above the Three Clarities. The ghostly Dao resides in the Fengdu Six Heavens. The lofty and pure numinous spirits chant mournful songs, resounding through the vast firmament."

The Eastern Master says: "The Lofty One is the Heavenly King, named Alan, who ever rides the Wheel of Radiant Clouds, roaming the nine-tiered peaks, dwelling atop the Jade Towers. He recites luminous scriptures to summon demons—above, a sanctuary for immortals and perfected beings; below, a dwelling for ghosts and spirits. His chanting of sacred verses, mournful songs resounding, echoes through the vast firmament."

The Recluse of the Dark Abode says: "Though even the highest perfected sages, their numinous qi pure and luminous, still chant mournful songs in sorrow, resounding through the empty void—these are the hymns of the Five Sufferings."

The Mysterious Splendor says: "The preceding passage exhorts humans to attain the Dao; this passage extols the beauty of mournful songs, universally delivering boundless beings. These words make clear that the Lofty Jade Emperor, grieving for the Three Realms, ever chants these mournful songs atop the Three Clarities. His song resounds through the vast firmament, compassionately pitying the multitudes. Thus it is said: *mournful songs resound through the vast firmament.* The *numinous spirits* refer to the Jade Emperor’s essence, the swift and luminous qi. He wishes only for the immortal Dao to be fulfilled, not for the human realm to fall into destitution."

The Eastern Master says: "The Heavenly King, atop the cloud towers, chants boundless scriptures. Seeing that scholars below cannot transcend the trials of the Three Realms, he recites them to restrain demonic spirits. Demons and devils respond at once, binding themselves; hordes of ghosts prostrate before his seat. Thus he delivers the bodies of seekers, perfecting their utmost true Dao."

The Recluse of the Dark Abode says: "Destitution means extremity. The extremity of the human realm is its nobility. If the immortal Dao is fulfilled, then all wondrous gatherings converge, the sufferings of the Five Turbidities vanish of themselves, and the joys of the Three Clarities never end. Though the human realm may reach its extremity in glory, fleeting honors and myriad pleasures must yield to a single suffering that forever obscures them."

The Lesser Florescence says: "The Lofty Jade Emperor, pure and luminous in spirit, chants mournful songs that resound through the vast firmament, filling the heavens. He wishes only for the immortal Dao to swiftly be fulfilled, not for humans to endure destitution and suffering."

The Northern Capital’s winding Spring Palace holds a host of ten thousand ghosts.

The Eastern Master says: "The Northern Capital’s mountains are governed by the divine demons of the Six Heavens. Within lies the winding Spring Palace, where a multitude of ghosts dwells. The Six Heavenly ghosts are all fierce, violent, and hideous demons, ever seeking to kill humans."

The Recluse of the Dark Abode says: "The Northern Capital lies within the Northern Dark Sea, the capital of the Northern Mysterious Supreme Emperor. Within it is the winding Spring Palace, the Palace of the Nine Dark Eternal Nights. As the great capital of ghosts, it harbors a host of ten thousand ghosts. Though we speak of ten thousand, how could there be only ten thousand? Know but one human, and you know the nature of ghosts. They ever seek to obstruct human destiny, severing the Gate of Life."

The Eastern Master says: "The demonic ghosts of the Six Heavens ever seek to obstruct and sever destiny, cutting off the Gate of Life, wishing humans dead."

The Recluse of the Dark Abode says: "The principle of ghosts is ever to diminish human lifespan, wishing them an early end, severing the root of life, cutting off the Gate of Life. Thus it was said earlier: *the ghostly Dao values death, facing the Gate of Human Life.*"

Ah, the people chant the cavernous scriptures to subdue the Northern Fengdu.

The Eastern Master says: "Ah, the people—this is how the demon kings speak among themselves. They recite and chant the cavernous scriptures to summon the demonic ghosts of the Northern Fengdu, preventing wanton killing and harm. Those who transgress are executed, aiding the celestial governance."

The Recluse of the Dark Abode says: "Ah—who, who can chant these empty cavernous scriptures to subdue and govern the ghosts of Fengdu? Then there will be no fear of obstructed destiny, and the scourge of premature death will naturally cease. Luofeng is the name of a mountain in the Northern Capital. Bind and dispatch the demonic essences, behead and mutilate the Six Ghostly Peaks."

The Eastern Master says: "Bind means to restrain. *Guo* means to annihilate the hordes of demons in the Six Heavens. *Peaks* is the general name for demons. Thus the incantation to the Six Heavenly demonic ghosts says: *Tianpeng, Tianpeng, Nine Primes slay the youths*—this is what is meant. The demon king chants this verse to sweep away and annihilate the demonic essences."

The Recluse of the Dark Abode says: "Bind means to detain and record. Dispatch means to banish and expel. Behead means to sever the head. *Guo* means to cut off the ears. If one can chant these scriptures, then demons can be detained, banished, beheaded, and mutilated. The Six Ghostly Peaks are the six peaks of Fengdu Mountain, each with its own palace. As there are six palaces, it is called the Six Ghostly Peaks. Each palace spans a thousand *li* in circumference."

The Lesser Florescence says: "*Aren* is how the demon king refers to himself. Severing the head is called beheading; cutting off the ears is called *guo*. The Six Ghosts are the six demonic thieves of the Six Heavens. *Feng* speaks of their precedence. *Feng* means sharp and keen. The demon king says: *I receive the talismanic command, ever chanting the cavernous scriptures to govern Fengdu, binding and dispatching demonic ghosts. Those who act with malevolence are executed and eradicated.*"

The Mysterious Splendor says: "Truly, it refers to severing the left ear. When many ghosts are slain, from each body the left ear is cut off and presented to the demon king, demonstrating the number killed. The left ear pertains to yang, thus it is taken."

The qi of all heavens flows vast and clear; my Dao daily flourishes.

The Eastern Master says: "Vast and clear means pure and luminous. *Flourishes* means the demon king’s songs soar through the void, sweeping away demonic qi to accomplish his work. Thus it is said: *daily flourishes.*"

Dark Abode says: "Having bound and restrained the essence of demonic spirits and beheaded the ghosts of the Six Peaks, the true qi of all heavens flows unimpeded, and my Dao’s orthodox transformation flourishes ever more."

Lesser Florescence says: "Wielding this awe-inspiring punishment to behead demonic ghosts, the perverse qi of the Six Heavens is swept away, and the true Dharma of the Three Heavens prospers."

**Second Realm of Form: The Chapter of the Demon King**

Eastern Master says: "The Realm of Form extends from the Void-Transcending Equilibrium Heaven to the Great Peace Imperial Cliff Heaven, comprising twelve heavens—this is the division of the Realm of Form. The demon king’s taboo name is *Mo*; his style, *Luo*."

Dark Abode says: "The second Realm of Form is the middle realm, situated above the Realm of Desire—hence it is called the *second*. *Form* denotes material substance; *realm*, a bounded domain. The Realm of Form contains eighteen heavens. The beings of these heavens possess form but no desire—thus it is called the Realm of Form. Since the demon king governs this realm, this chapter is established for him."

Lesser Florescence says: "From the Void-Transcending Equilibrium Heaven to the Boundless Cloud-Vow Heaven, there are eighteen heavens in all, constituting the Realm of Form. The Daoist scriptures state: *With three hundred merits of pure and cool bodily conduct, one may be reborn in the Realm of Form.* The demon king’s taboo name is *Mo Luo*."

**Vast and Lofty, Radiant Qi Soars to the Four Quarters**
Eastern Master says: "*Vast and lofty* means high and distant. *Radiant qi* refers to clarity and luminosity. The qi of heaven is high and distant, pure and bright—thus it is said to *soar to the four quarters*."

Dark Abode says: "*Vast and lofty* means expansive and open. *Soars* means unfolds. The heavens of the ten directions are expansive and lofty, their luminous brilliance unfolding to the four quarters."

Lesser Florescence says: "*Soars* means ascends. My realm is vast and lofty, unfolding high and wide; the qi of Brahma shines brightly, ascending in all four directions."

**The Brahma-Conduct Heavens Encircle the Ten Directions**
Eastern Master says: "*Brahma* refers to the great Brahma qi. *Ten directions* denotes the flying celestial beings of the ten quarters. Riding the great Brahma qi, they traverse the Three Realms and roam the ten directions."

Lesser Florescence says: "When the great Brahma qi pervades all heavens, the immortals of the ten directions encircle them tenfold—hence it is said to *encircle the ten directions*. Such immortals are numberless; through my protection and deliverance, they attain the rank of great immortals. Thus it is said: *All proceed from my being.* I possess the cavernous scriptures—chanting them ten thousand times, one becomes an immortal. These are the very songs. The boundless great deities all proceed from my being."

Eastern Master says: "*Boundless* refers to the boundless great deities of the ten directions. Those who study the Dao alongside the demon king and attain realization all proceed from the demon king’s sponsorship to become perfected beings. Thus it is said: *All proceed from my being.*"

Dark Abode says: "*Brahma-conduct* denotes the conduct of the utmost truth. *I* is the demon king’s self-reference. The thirty-two heavens’ Brahma-conduct perfected beings, along with the boundless great deities of the ten directions, all proceed from my sponsorship to dwell in these heavens. I possess the cavernous scriptures—chanting them ten thousand times, one becomes an immortal."

Eastern Master says: "*Cavernous scriptures* are the demon king’s songs. If a disciple recites them ten thousand times, the demon king will sponsor their direct ascent to immortality. The Dao of immortals values deliverance; the way of ghosts is intertwined with it."

Eastern Master says: "The Dao of immortals seeks to deliver beings upward; the way of ghosts seeks to bring about their death. The two are intertwined, dragging one another into the evil destinies."

Dark Abode says: "I possess these cavernous scriptures—chanting them ten thousand times, all may ascend as immortals. The Dao of immortals values the deliverance of both form and spirit; the way of ghosts values the continuity of life and death. Deliverance uplifts one’s ancestors as well; continuity ensnares one’s descendants."

**Heaven and Earth Vast and Obscure, Foul Qi Billows**
Eastern Master says: "*Vast and obscure* means dim and indistinct. *Foul* means evil; *billows*, chaos. Heaven and earth are high and distant, all-encompassing. The pure dwell above; the turbid, below. Demonic essences and evil qi fill the void."

Dark Abode says: "Heaven is boundlessly high; earth, boundlessly vast. Foul qi constantly billows, pervading the great void."

**The Three Realms’ Joy—Transcend It to Abide Forever**
Eastern Master says: "The *Three Realms* are the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm. These are not the ultimate joy. Only by transcending the Three Realms can one attain the Dao of immortality, revolving with the kalpas yet free from birth and death—thus abiding forever."

Dark Abode says: "If the beings of the Three Realms are deluded by joy and dwell in it, their joy will end, and they will sink into degradation. If they awaken to the truth that joy is not true joy, they will transcend it and abide forever."

**Delivered Across My Realm, the Body Enters the Natural**
Dark Abode says: "If one awakens to the truth that joy is not true joy, they will not dwell in it but cultivate progress. Thus they are delivered across the perils of the Three Realms and enter the state of the Natural."

Lesser Florescence says: "Though the Three Realms bring joy, when merit is exhausted, one falls. Even if one’s lifespan equals the grains of sand, in the end, all must perish. This moment’s joy—how slight it is, owing to my grace."

Eastern Master says: "Having entered the Formless Realm, one attains this bliss. *My grace* is the demon king’s self-reference. You all proceed from my sponsorship to enter the ranks of immortals—thus it is said: *how slight it is, owing to my grace.*"

Dark Abode says: "Entering the state of the Natural, one abides in the true joy of the Natural. The joy of the Three Realms is illusory, revolving in delusion. This joy shares the name but differs in principle; beings diverge, and realms differ. All proceed from the demon king’s sponsorship to reach this domain of true joy—thus it is said: *how slight it is, owing to my grace.*"

Lesser Florescence says: "Only by transcending the Three Realms can one attain joy—thus it is said: *this moment’s joy—how slight it is, owing to my grace.* Through my protection and deliverance, one enters the Three Clarities—thus it is said: *owing to my grace.*"

**The Dragon-Han Eon Vast—How Can One Discern the True?**
Eastern Master says: "In the Dragon-Han eon, the Jade Script first emerged from the Great Blessing Hall Kingdom, and the sun and moon first shone."

The Primordial Beginning compiled the Jade Scriptures and issued the Dharma to deliver beings. The customs of that land were refined beyond naming; its people first attained governance, and rites and music flourished. Human lifespans reached thirty-six thousand years. In the vast transformation of the eon’s end, after the passing of the Yan-Kang era, it sank into an aeon of oblivion—so distant and boundless that its truth, though certain, was not empty. Without penetrating the profound and exhausting the subtle, none could recognize it.

Lesser Florescence says: "Having refined the body to become immortal and cultivated the mortal to attain sagehood, one departs suffering for joy and leaves death for life—thus one knows the numinous transformation of the Dao, whose wondrous efficacy brings this about. At the time of the Dragon-Han eon, when chaos had not yet divided, heaven had not yet arisen, and the void stretched boundless—how could one discern the true?"

Lesser Florescence says: "In the initial kalpa of the Dragon-Han, people were all simple and unadorned, content in their natural state, knowing no desires. Though vast and level, none could distinguish truth from falsehood. My realm abounds with trials, and thus truth and falsehood may be discerned. My realm is difficult to cross—hence the creation of the Cavern Scriptures."

Eastern Master says: "The demon king declares: 'Since the Dragon-Han eon, my merit and virtue have been most weighty, yet I have not attained immortality. Those who study the Dao superficially seek to cross my realm—truly, this is difficult.' Thus he sings this song to exhort learners, that they may recognize the true."

Lesser Florescence says: "This realm is difficult to transcend, not because the Cavern Scriptures cannot ferry one across. Therefore, the demon king established this text to guide and aid, for one relies both on the grace of elevation and the virtue of support."

Lesser Florescence says: "The demon hosts of my realm abound with illusions and deceptions, making it difficult to cross—hence the creation of the Cavern Scriptures. They transform and soar through the void to test your body."

Eastern Master says: "The demon king, within the boundless void, flies and sings ballads to test whether the hearts of learners are upright or not."

Lesser Florescence says: "Fearing that the pursuit of the Dao may not be earnest or the grasp of integrity firm, he manifests transformations in the void to observe, and treads water and fire without delusion."

Lesser Florescence says: "Flying and transforming, displaying divine powers, he tests your body and mind, causing you to lose the true Dao. How many succeed or falter, how few are delivered? Those who cross are few indeed."

Eastern Master says: "The hearts of scholars are hesitant and unsteady; few reach attainment. Unable to discern truth from falsehood, they are deluded by demonic hosts, leading to slackness. Among ten thousand, not one is delivered."

Lesser Florescence says: "Having endured the trials of water and fire, there are those who succeed and those who fail. Few cross alone; many waver and fall back. None are delivered. Laughing at those who do not cross, he sings this song."

Eastern Master says: "You—it is you. I laugh at you for having only the aspiration for the Dao but lacking its realization. Though you revolve through aeons without end, if your heart is not profoundly unified, you will never be delivered."

Lesser Florescence says: "For those who succeed or fail and retreat, he sighs and pities them, thus composing this song to universally enable their deliverance."

**The Third Song of the Formless Realm’s Demon King**

Eastern Master says: "From the Utmost Wind Heaven of Manifest Concentration to the Ten Heavens of Prohibited Joyful Elegance, this is the division of the Formless Realm. From the Utmost Constant Fusion Heaven to the Four Heavens of the Supreme Polarity’s Nurturing Splendor, this is the upper Formless Realm."

Lesser Florescence says: "The third Formless Realm lies above the Form Realm—hence it is called the third. 'Formless' means without physical form; 'realm' means domain. The Formless Realm has four heavens, and the people of these heavens are empty of both form and desire—hence it is called formless. The demon king’s song refers to the ballads of this realm’s demon king."

Lesser Florescence says: "The Daoist scriptures state: 'With six hundred merits of pure karmic deeds of the mind, one is born in the four heavens of the Formless Realm.' The demon king of this realm is named Shao. Above the Three Realms, boundless and vast, lies the Great Veil."

Eastern Master says: "Miao-miao sounds like 'lofty and distant.' The Great Veil refers to the Great Veil Heaven, which lies above the Three Realms."

Lesser Florescence says: "Above the Three Realms, beyond the Round Veil, though not yet reaching the Utmost Non-Being, it is still the domain of the Great Veil."

Lesser Florescence says: "Miao-miao means lofty and distant. Above the Three Realms lie the Four Brahma Heavens and the Three Clarities, and only then does one reach the Great Veil. Here, the demon king’s song abbreviates the text."

Above, no roots of form; cloud-layers towering, lofty.

Eastern Master says: "Layers mean stacked and repeated; e’e means high and steep. The Great Veil Heaven does not partake of the Form Realm but lies above all heavens, forming mountains from condensed clouds. Above are nine-tiered cloud-palaces, towering and lofty."

Lesser Florescence says: "Within this Great Veil are five realms. Above, there is no obstructing form; below, no fixed roots. All are transformations of wondrous qi, like radiant clouds, ethereal and shimmering. This is the form of no-form, elusive and indescribable—thus it is said to exist yet not exist."

Lesser Florescence says: "The realm of the Great Veil forms mountains from condensed clouds, with nine-tiered terraces, towering and steep. Jade forests stand empty, born without roots."

Mystic Splendor says: "This describes the true emptiness of the Great Veil Heaven’s realm. Mountains, forests, cities, palaces, terraces, and pavilions are all formed from the natural wondrous qi, not through construction. The mortal eye cannot see them—hence they are called formless. Floating in the void, they are called rootless."

Only the Primordial Beginning, the home of boundless kalpas.

Eastern Master says: "The Primordial Beginning is the Heavenly Worthy. 'Boundless kalpas' means vast and innumerable. The Dao of the Primordial Beginning, through countless kalpas, eternally dwells in the Great Veil Heaven."

Lesser Florescence says: "The palaces and towers of these five realms are all the abodes of the Primordial Beginning. The Primordial Beginning is without end, eternally abiding in stillness—hence it is called the home of boundless kalpas."

Beyond the Five Realms, all is governed by the Primordial Beginning—each realm’s sovereign holds the Primordial Beginning as supreme.

Lesser Florescence says: "The Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy dwells within these realms, vast and boundless, its kalpas beyond reckoning. It governs our realm, receiving authority from the Mysterious Capital."

Eastern Master says: "To 'govern' means that within the Great Veil Heaven, the Heavenly Worthy presides, with all great sages above. There lies the Mysterious Capital Mountain and the Seven-Treasure Terrace. Upon the terrace rests the *Scripture of the Three Treasures*. Thrice daily, the great sages ascend the Seven-Treasure Terrace, circumambulating in recitation to subdue the myriad demons."

Lesser Florescence says: "The Primordial Beginning is not merely the sovereign of a single realm but also restrains the demon kings of the Three Realms. It unifies the Mysterious Capital, spreading and transforming the myriad manifestations. The Mysterious Capital is the Jade Capital of the Great Veil Heaven."

"Should one transcend our realm, the body enters the Jade Void."

Eastern Master says: "Our realm is the Formless Realm. The body itself enters the realm of the Jade Void. As the Formless is the upper realm, it borders the Jade Void. The Jade Void is the qi of the Jade Void. Having ascended beyond the Formless, the body enters the Purple Ultimate Palace, where the Jade Void Emperor governs within. The Purple Ultimate is another name for the Supreme Ultimate."

Lesser Florescence says: "The Jade Void is the Mysterious Capital Jade Capital."

Lesser Florescence says: "The Primordial Beginning governs our realm, receiving authority from the Mysterious Capital Purple Tenuity. Transcending our realm, the body enters the Jade Void—having passed beyond our Formless Realm. After surpassing the Four Heavens of the Form Realm, one enters the Jade Void. The myriad qi of the Upper Origin, the Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries, all coalesce into human form from the qi of the Jade Void. Our position is that of the Upper King, rectifying and ruling the host of demons."

Eastern Master says: "The Upper King is the sovereign of demon kings, named Shao. He declares, 'Our position is that of the Upper King, restraining and ruling the host of demons—hence the title Upper King.'"

Lesser Florescence says: "The King is the supreme sovereign over all demons. Thus, it is said he rectifies and rules the host of demons. 'Rectify' means to correct; 'rule' means to restrain."

Lesser Florescence says: "The demon king of this realm holds the highest position, governing the Three Realms below and regulating the multitude of demons. Yet in the void, ten thousand transformations arise, and impure qi blooms in profusion."

Eastern Master says: "'Profusion' means chaos; 'bloom' means flourishing. The Three Realms and the void together teem with demonic spirits and ghosts, their transformations chaotic and resplendent, deluding the hearts of seekers—hence called 'blooming in profusion.'"

Lesser Florescence says: "The 'ten thousand transformations in the void' test the seeker, as transformations soar through the air to assay one’s body. 'Blooming in profusion' refers to the pervasive miasma—worldly defilements that fill the empty void, congesting the cosmos."

"Those who preserve the true are few; the deluded are many."

Eastern Master says: "'Preserve' means to secure; 'deluded' means perverse and disordered. Those who secure the true are few; the perverse and disordered are many."

Lesser Florescence says: "Alas! How rare are those who preserve the true in this world, while the deluded and unenlightened abound—how much more so when the whole world is lost in confusion."

"The Dao of immortality is hard to secure; the path of ghosts readily turns to perversity."

Eastern Master says: "The Dao of immortals is formless, hence difficult to uphold; the path of ghosts is rife with desire, hence easily perverted. As the scripture says: 'Not seeing what may be desired keeps the heart undisturbed.'"

Lesser Florescence says: "The Dao of immortal cultivation demands that the true nature be hard to secure; the ghostly path requires no learning, for the mundane heart is already perverse. Drifting with the wind, following the current, one strays ever further—hence it is said the ghostly path readily turns to perversity."

"The human path lies in the heart—truly, it does not depend on others."

Eastern Master says: "The decline of the human path begins in the heart. One must assess one’s own feelings and not rely on others."

Lesser Florescence says: "The principle of the human path resides in the square inch of the heart. Whether one awakens to the Dao and cultivates the true, or strays into perversity and enters the ghostly path, all depends on one’s own heart and lungs—truly, it does not depend on others. 'Truly' means to believe."

"The Dao of immortals values substance; the human path values splendor."

Eastern Master says: "The Dao of immortals accords with nature, discarding superficial splendor to embrace utmost substance. The human path values glory and splendor, the opposite of the immortal Dao."

Lesser Florescence says: "The Dao of immortal cultivation values truth and substance; the path of worldly conduct values superficial splendor. Thus, the scripture says: 'Dwell in its substance, not in its splendor.'"

"If you do not delight in the immortal Dao, how can you transcend the Three Realms?"

Eastern Master says: "'You' means 'you.' If you are not single-minded, how can you ascend beyond the Three Realms?"

Lesser Florescence says: "If you, O worldly people, do not cultivate the immortal Dao and ascend to the Five Realms, then the trials of the Three Realms cannot be overcome. This means to rise beyond their bounds, not merely to pass through them."

"If you wish to revolve through the Five Paths, what can I do for you?"

Eastern Master says: "The Five Paths are the fields of the five sufferings. 'What can I do' is an expression of sorrow. The demon king, seeing seekers in the Three Realms who fail to transcend, defeated by perverse spirits and unable to attain right vision, sink into evil destinies and lose their prior merit, must then endure all manner of suffering within the Five Paths—how grievous! Hence this profound lament."

Lesser Florescence says: "If you do not rise above the Three Realms, you will naturally revolve through the Five Paths. Since this is the consequence of your own actions, what can I do for you? Thus, it is said: 'The human path lies in the heart—truly, it does not depend on others.' The meaning of the Five Paths has been explained above."

Lesser Florescence says: "Those who do not delight in the Three Heavens but instead revolve through the Five Paths, prizing splendor and abandoning substance—what can I do for them?"

Above the Three Realms, in the midst of the floating void, the demon king’s song resounds, its verses interwoven with cavernous hymns.

Eastern Master says: "Above the Three Realms, the demon king chants sacred texts in the void, yet remains within the Three Realms, his verses intermingling with cavernous hymns."

Lesser Florescence says: "The demon king, ever above the Three Realms in the empty void, sings this hymn, lamenting the plight of worldly people with profound sorrow."

The hymn’s meaning interpenetrates, far harmonizing with the Great Cavern. The demon king is the lord of demons, not a king who is demonic. Thus, though his person is most numinous, his words align with the Great Cavern. Reciting it a hundred times is called "crossing the Southern Palace"; reciting it a thousand times, the demon king safeguards and welcomes; with ten thousand recitations, the Way is complete—one soars into the Great Void, transcends the Three Realms, and ascends to the rank of Immortal Duke.

Lesser Florescence says: To recite it a hundred times refers specifically to this demon king’s hymn, not the entire scripture. After a hundred recitations, one’s name is registered and ascends to the Vermilion Palace above the Southern Crossing. After a thousand recitations, the demon king protects and escorts one in all goings and comings. When the Way is perfected through ten thousand recitations, one rides a dragon to ascend to the Great Clarity, soars to the Great Ultimate, roams the Great Void, personally transcends the tribulations of the Three Realms, and attains the rank of Immortal Duke. Yet those today who recite it ten thousand times without achieving this result either practice good and evil equally, with merit and transgression balanced, or recite with the mouth while the heart wanders, violating the rites and losing the method—such people only invite further descent, how can they hope for ascent? If the heart accords with the scripture and conduct aligns with its teachings, uniting solely in goodness and cutting off all entanglements, then even after only a few thousand recitations, one may glimpse the effect; why must one wait until ten thousand recitations to ascend into the Great Void?

Mysterious Splendor says: The Immortal Duke is a rank among the Most High Perfected. To fly beyond the Three Realms, one first arrives at the Four Heavens of Seed People; above that lie the Three Clarities, which are the ranks of the Immortal Dukes. The phrase "flying beyond the Three Realms, ascending to the rank of Immortal Duke" is an abbreviation in the text.

Those who hear the numinous sound—before them, the demon king shows reverence.

Mysterious Splendor says: "Those who hear the numinous sound" refers to hearing the original hymn of the Numinous Treasure. The Dao Lord praised it, saying that even the demon king of the Three Realms composed a hymn of the Cavern Mystery, and those who recite and uphold it can still achieve perfection and enter the Way. How much more so for those who hear the original hymn of my Numinous Treasure—if they recite and uphold it, all the demon kings of the Three Realms will revere their persons. Thus it is said, "the demon king shows reverence."

He commands and restrains the earth spirits.

Lesser Florescence says: This is the command of the Most High.

*The Bowu Zhi* states: The abodes of the earth spirits lie beneath Mount Kunlun.

**Attendant escort for departure and return.**
*Youxi* says: Should there be those who hear the verses of this numinous hymn, the demon kings shall command and restrain the earth spirits, so that when one remains at home, they stand guard, and when one goes forth or returns, they escort and receive.

**Deliverance from the Five Sufferings and Eight Adversities of the earthly prisons, with seven generations of ancestors ascending and migrating, forever departing the offices of the ghostly bureaucracy.**
*Youxi* says: To lift the seven generations to immortality, to transcend the eight adversities of ghostly exile, to forever emerge from the Dark River of the netherworld, to bid eternal farewell to the officials of the Northern Bureau. The Three Paths and Five Sufferings together form the Eight Adversities, as previously annotated.

**The soul crosses to the Vermilion Mound, undergoes refinement and rebirth—this is called boundless and universal deliverance without end.**
*Youxi* says: Once the seven generations have ascended, they all enter the Southern Palace to undergo refinement. When the refinement is complete, they are reborn. This may be called universal deliverance without limit, vast salvation without measure. The Vermilion Mound is the Southern Vermilion Mound Palace.

**There are secret celestial patterns, revered by all the heavens.**
**To leak or slight them is to fall into hell, with calamity extending to seven generations of ancestors.**
*Youxi* says: If one treasures and venerates these texts, then the Heavenly Emperors, all the sages, and the numinous spirits shall together hold them in reverence. If one treats them with carelessness or leaks them, the body shall be punished by the Three Offices, and misfortune shall extend to the seven generations. Since the scripture has now concluded, these admonitions are reiterated—these are the two chapters.

**The Dao says: These two chapters are the hidden and sacred sounds of the Heavenly Emperors and the most numinous demon kings.**
*Dong* says: "The Dao says" refers to the Dao Lord’s own preface. The "two chapters" are: first, the *Primal Cavern Mystery Hymn*, and second, the *Primal Cavern Jade Calendar Hymn*—together called the two chapters. The names and hidden mysteries of the great gods of the heavens, the Heavenly Emperors, and the demon kings are profound, hence they are called the hidden and secret purport.

*Youxi* says: From this point onward, every chapter that begins with "The Dao says" is likewise the speech of the Dao Lord, consistent with the preceding preface. These two chapters of the original scripture were spoken by the Primordial Beginning. The preceding preface was later added by the Most High. The first chapter contains the hidden names of the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors, while the second holds the secret sounds of the demon kings of the Three Realms. All are the words of the Great Brahma, not the common speech of the mundane world.

*Youxi* says: Since they were spoken by the Primordial Beginning and expounded by the Most High, they are the secret hymns of the heavens and the hidden melodies of the numinous and demonic. Naturally, they embody the supreme principles of the Great Brahma—how could they be the ordinary words of the mundane world? Their language lacks ornate rhythm, their verses lack florid elegance; thus they are called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail.

*Youxi* says: Since they are not the common speech of the mundane world, they lack ornate rhythm. As they convey the profound purport of the heavens, they lack florid elegance. Unless one is a perfected person who has penetrated the mysteries and investigated the subtle, none can fully comprehend them. "Language" refers to discourse; "verses" refer to the lines and phrases.

*Shaowei* says: "Profound" means deep; "obscure" means hidden. The names of the Heavenly Emperors and the titles of the demon kings in these two texts—all their language lacks melodious beauty, their verses lack ornate refinement. This depth and obscurity are why they are difficult to interpret.

**These are treasured by the heavens and kept secret in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mysterious Capital.**
*Youxi* says: Since they are revered by the sages of the heavens, they are kept secret in the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis above. The Three Realms—Grand Ultimate, Jade Purity, and Highest Purity—each has its own Purple Tenuity Palace.

**According to the Mysterious Regulations, they are transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas.**
*Dong* says: "The heavens" here refer to the heavens of the upper realms. This scripture is treasured by the sages of the upper heavens and kept secret in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mysterious Capital. According to the Mysterious Regulations, it is transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. "Mysterious" refers to the heavens. This is the time limit of the heavens; in the human realm, it is transmitted once every forty years, hence it is called the Mysterious Regulations.

It is also said that in the study of the Dao and the transmission of scriptures, one may transmit to one person every forty years. Those who extend their lifespan gain four hundred years; those who attain earthly immortality gain four thousand years; those who attain heavenly immortality gain forty thousand years; and those who fully realize the Dao of the Supreme Perfected gain forty thousand kalpas.

*Youxi* says: Since it is said that "ten thousand kalpas are like last night," this is the celestial measure of the Dao. "A thousand springs are like this morning"—thus, transmission once every forty thousand kalpas is not considered distant. This is the standard of the celestial perfected, hence it is said to follow the Mysterious Regulations, without specifying the time limits for transmission among perfected persons.

**If there is a perfected person who offers gold and treasures, pledges sincerity according to the ancient standards, and makes oaths to the Ten Heavens, only then shall it be bestowed.**
*Dong* says: As previously stated, the heavens have their time limits. Among them, if there is a person of utmost faith whose heart is devoted to the great Dharma, who can use gold and treasures as a pledge of sincerity, and who comes seeking to receive it, they must then transgress the prohibitions, make oaths to the Ten Heavens, and only then may it be transmitted.

*Youxi* says: Both the preceding preface and this passage mention offering gold and treasures, without specifying the quantity. Since this is a pledge of sincerity, the heart of the perfected person is one, but the amount may vary. According to one’s means, one makes oaths to the ten directions and swears before the heavens. Though the gold and treasures may be modest, the oath is weighty. Since the preface has already spoken of this, and the scripture concludes with another oath, it is reiterated again and again to ensure that none neglect the unseen regulations.

**The Dao says: The revolutions of heaven and earth also have their ends in adversity.**
*Dong* says: "Revolutions" refer to four: the generation of humans, the death of humans, the averting of disasters, and the benefits of meritorious deeds. It is also said: Heaven one, Earth two, Heaven three, Earth four. "Revolution" refers to the kalpas; "measure" refers to the calculations. The Yang Nine and Hundred Six are all measures of prosperity and adversity. Though heaven and earth are vast, they too have their periods of decline and ruin—this is the meaning.

*Youxi* says: Heaven’s distress is the Yang Nine calamity; Earth’s adversity is the Hundred Six disaster. Hence it is said that the revolutions of heaven and earth also have their ends in adversity.

*Shaowei* says: In minor cases, the Hundred Six and Yang Nine; in major cases, the dissolution of the Three Realms.

**Xuan Ying says:** *"Adversity’s end"* refers to the Yang Nine and Hundred Six calamities, while *"end"* signifies the dissolution of the Three Realms. The Yang Nine and Hundred Six: according to the *Zhou Yi*, nineteen years form one *zhang*, four *zhang* form one *bu*, twenty *bu* form one *tong*, and three *tong* form one *yuan*—a *yuan* spanning four thousand six hundred twenty years. Within this cycle, fifty-four years bring floods and droughts. The Yang Nine: as the odd number of Yang culminates at nine, calamities manifest—at their greatest, nine years of drought; lesser cases bring seven, five, three, or one year of fire. The even number of Yin culminates at eight, with calamities bringing eight, six, four, or two years of floods. The Hundred Six: upon entering a *yuan*, the first one hundred sixty years—an odd number of Yang—bring minor droughts, hence the term *"Hundred Six calamity."* Broadly speaking, the conjunctions of Yang Nine and Hundred Six: the first three hundred years of a *yuan* mark the lesser Yang Nine and lesser Hundred Six; nine hundred years bring the great Yang Nine and great Hundred Six. At their greatest, nine years of severe drought and eight years of catastrophic floods. The *Han Shu* states: four thousand six hundred seventeen years form one *yuan*; when the count of three *yuan* is exhausted, it marks the end of the great kalpa, and heaven and earth dissolve. Three *yuan* total thirteen thousand eight hundred fifty-one years. The first one hundred sixty years of a *yuan* bring minor calamities, hence the term *"Hundred Six."* The meaning of *"adversity’s end"* is roughly outlined as above.

The sun, moon, and five planets also wax and wane. **Dong says:** The sun declines after noon; the moon wanes after fullness. When the stellar lodges halt or fail to revolve, it too marks heaven’s appointed time—all are natural principles of numerology. **Youxi says:** The sun and moon undergo eclipses and phases; the five planets deviate from their proper paths.

Even the most sagely and divine beings experience prosperity and adversity. **Dong says:** The most sagely are not yet the greatest sages—King Wen was imprisoned at Youli, and Confucius faced hardship in Chen and Cai—all were times of adversity. **Youxi says:** Even the sagely and divine endure cycles of prosperity and decline; how much more so for the common folk, whose trials defy description!

Scholars of lesser learning also suffer illness and harm. **Dong says:** If heaven, earth, and sages experience adversity, how can lesser scholars avoid affliction? **Youxi says:** For humble students of minor learning, illness and misfortune are natural; if they encounter such, they should accept it without resentment.

When such calamities arise, those of shared *qi* must unite in heart to perform purification rites. **Shaowei says:** *"Shared qi"* refers to shared methods—those who together receive the wondrous *qi* of the Dao. Burning incense in the six periods and reciting the scriptures ten times will summon blessings and dissolve all misfortune. The boundless scriptures universally deliver limitless beings. **Youxi says:** In times of calamity, summon fellow students and like-minded companions to unite in heart and strength, perform purification rites, repent, burn incense in the six periods, and recite these scriptures ten times around. The reward of virtue will manifest immediately, and inauspicious disasters will naturally dissipate. Thus, we know the scriptures’ power is vast and universal, broadly aiding the world.

**The Dao says:** Those of lesser learning, whose Dao is shallow or whose immortal rank remains unfulfilled, may face karmic dissolution, their bodies passing through the Palace of Great Yin. **Dong says:** All who die pass through the offices of Great Yin; for such individuals, reciting scriptures and practicing the Way is essential. **Youxi says:** Lesser scholars may have weak past-life merits or insufficient present virtue, causing their resolve for the Dao to falter and karmic obstacles to encroach. Unable to attain the rank of immortals, their names are already inscribed in the ghostly registers. Thus, when the mysterious workings of fate summon them, they meet their end, their souls returning to Great Yin and their corpses lying in the earth. **Shaowei says:** The ghostly path is the Palace of Great Yin.

At the moment of passing, fellow students and perfected beings should burn incense and recite the scriptures ten times to deliver the corpse according to the proper method. **Youxi says:** Companions of the same covenant and learning, true friends, should wholeheartedly perform purification rites and recite the scriptures ten times. At the time of death, they collectively deliver the corpse, so that the living gain the merit of salvation, and the deceased receive the blessing of liberation. *"According to the proper method"* refers to following the Five Refinements for the Living Corpse. The soul then ascends directly to the Southern Palace. **Dong says:** For those facing death, if fellow students again burn incense and recite scriptures to deliver the corpse, the soul will ascend to the Southern Palace and receive natural blessings. According to their accumulated merit, they will be reborn after a calculated period, escape the cycle of rebirth, and attain immortality. **Dong says:** When merit reaches three thousand, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight. **Youxi says:** Having performed the corpse-deliverance rites, the soul ascends to the Vermilion Palace, refined in the flowing fires of the courtyard. Depending on the depth of their cultivated merit, the length of their allotted time—years, months, or days—is measured. Once the term is complete, the spirit returns to the body, and they are reborn. Though outwardly deceased, after a time of accumulation, it feels like a brief slumber, unaware of the passage of years. From then on, they attain immortality—this is also the path of corpse liberation.

**The Dao says:** When the revolutions of heaven and earth near their end, purification rites must be performed, incense burned, and scriptures recited. **Dong says:** To avert calamitous revolutions. **Youxi says:** When heaven and earth face adversity and their cycles approach their end, perform purification rites, repent, and recite these scriptures to pacify and ward off disaster.

When the stellar lodges deviate from their paths and the sun and moon lose their proper phases, purification rites must be performed, incense burned, and scriptures recited. **Dong says:** To preserve peace and tranquility. **Youxi says:** When the five planets deviate from their celestial paths and the sun and moon suffer eclipses or lose their proper phases, perform purification rites, repent, and recite these scriptures to restore order.

When the four seasons lose their balance and Yin and Yang fall out of harmony, purification rites must be performed, incense burned, and scriptures recited.

**Dong says:** To regulate Yin and Yang.

**Youxi says:** When spring, summer, autumn, and winter fail to transition in their seasons, when Yin and Yang’s pitch-pipes fall into discord, and when the qi and climate grow perverse, purification rites must be performed, repentance offered, and these scriptures recited to restore harmony.

When the sovereign faces disaster and warfare erupts on all sides, purification rites must be performed, incense burned, and scriptures recited.

**Dong says:** To safeguard and protect.

**Youxi says:** When the state suffers calamity and arms rise on all fronts, purification rites must be performed, repentance offered, and these scriptures recited to dispel the disaster.

When pestilence spreads and the multitudes perish or suffer harm, purification rites must be performed, incense burned, and scriptures recited.

**Dong says:** To suppress and subdue.

**Youxi says:** When epidemic poisons rage and seasonal maladies afflict the people, causing countless deaths and injuries, purification rites must be performed, repentance offered, and these scriptures recited to eradicate the calamity.

**Xuanying says:** The Son of Heaven refers to the people as *zhaomin* ("the multitudes"), while feudal lords call them *wanmin* ("the ten thousand"). A *zhao* denotes ten billion, signifying their vast number. This clarifies that when the sovereign faces disaster, the multitudes suffer harm.

When masters, teachers, or friends face the end of their allotted span, purification rites must be performed, incense burned, and scriptures recited.

**Dong says:** When masters, disciples, or friends reach the end of their destined time, burn incense and recite the scriptures ten times to deliver and ferry their souls.

**Youxi says:** When Daoist masters or companions approach the end of their lives, perform purification rites according to the preceding methods to deliver their corporeal forms, that they may attain immortality.

The merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is profound. Above, it dispels heavenly disasters and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poisonous harm and delivers the multitudes.

**Youxi says:** The merit of purification rites, precepts, incense offerings, and scripture recitation is deep, and the blessings they bestow are weighty. Above, they can eliminate heavenly calamities and secure the emperor’s reign; below, they can dispel poisonous harm and universally deliver the people from peril.

**Shaowei says:** Each year, in the twelfth month, the *Daling* (Great Mound) star, also called the *Jishi* (Accumulated Corpses), emits qi that descends upon the earth, seeping into mounds and decaying bones. Its ascending qi is ridden by ghosts, spreading febrile diseases known as epidemic poisons. Reciting the scriptures can dispel these afflictions, sparing the people from death.

The blessings of life and death depend upon it, their merit boundless. Thus it is said: "Limitless deliverance of heaven and humanity."

**Youxi says:** "Life depends upon it" means attaining the Dao in this body and ascending to heaven in broad daylight. "Death depends upon it" means the soul is ferried to the Vermilion Mound, where it undergoes refinement and immortal transformation. Heavenly beings ascend to the joy of the Three Clarities, while mortals instantly transcend the eight sufferings. The merit of broad salvation is vast, and the virtue of universal deliverance is profound.

**Shaowei says:** All references to purification rites denote the *Huanglu* and other such rites, which employ the Five Scriptures for stabilization and thanksgiving—these are not the purification rites of the common world. Petitions are presented in the three periods to move heaven and earth, summon blessings, and dispel calamities.

*The Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on the Limitless Salvation of Humanity, with Four Commentaries, Fascicle Three*
*The Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on the Limitless Salvation of Humanity, with Four Commentaries, Fascicle Four*

**The Dao says:** Wherever this scripture exists, if the sovereign of heaven and earth or the multitudes perform these meritorious deeds in times of disaster, resolve to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times, all the heavens will record their names, and the myriad spirits will guard them.

**Youxi says:** "Record their names" means inscribing their virtuous deeds. If one can uphold this scripture, follow the preceding instructions, and resolve to perform purification rites with sincerity, then above, they will dispel the disasters of heaven and earth; in the middle, they will augment the sovereign’s blessings; and below, they will relieve the suffering of the multitudes. The heavens will then inscribe their names on the Yellow Registers and White Tablets, and the myriad spirits will guard them in walking, standing, sitting, and reclining.

Only those of exceptional attainment may become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Lord.

The Eastern Master says: "The term *right distinction* here follows the convention of official documents, where matters are itemized on the right." ○ Youxi says: "If there are those of profound understanding who embody the truth, able to follow the scriptural precepts and cultivate accordingly, they will surely assist the Sage Lord and stand in attendance at the Golden Gates. The Golden Gates are the abode of the Sage Lord." ○ Shaowei says: "The Sage Lord is the Later Sage, the Great Peace Lord Li of the Golden Gates. His personal name is Hong, and in a future kalpa, he will descend to become the ruler of humanity, hence he is preemptively called the Later Sage Lord. The *Xuan Zhong Ji* of Master Yin states: The Most High Lord Lao constantly dwells in the Purple Tenuity Palace, also known as the Heavenly August Great Emperor, the Celestial Worthy of Grand Unity, and the Sage Lord of the Golden Gates. The myriad things of heaven and earth are none that do not arise from his transformation. If one can fast with utmost sincerity, recite and chant the numinous scriptures, they may ascend to the Purple Tenuity and become his ministers." The *Jade Record* states: "Those who do not invoke the Twenty-Four Spirits or know the names of the Three Eights and the Scenic Forms cannot become ministers of the Sage Lord of the Golden Gates." The heavens record the merits and transgressions of people without the slightest error. Youxi says: "The heavens oversee and report correspondences, distinguishing and recording the good and evil of people, scrutinizing the merits and faults of practitioners. Since not even the finest detail is missed, neither is the most minute speck overlooked. The Demon Kings of the heavens will also protect and recommend you. Only those who attain the Way may thoroughly comprehend the ultimate teachings." The Eastern Master says: "The Five Heavens, the Three Realms, and the supremely numinous Demon Kings will protect your person and surely commend your merits. Those with the bone structure and destined portion of the elect, who are to attain the Way and achieve perfection, must thoroughly examine the scriptural words and deeply embody their true purport." ○ Shaowei says: "People should only diligently cultivate fasting and purification; on the day they attain the Way, they will naturally understand the ultimate teachings. This is said lest those who have not yet grasped the profound meaning grow lax midway and abandon their resolve." The Immeasurable Sounds of the Great Hidden Language of Brahmā in the Heavens ○ The Dao Lord composed this. The Eastern Master says: "Hidden' has four aspects: first, the concealment of names; second, the concealment of taboos; third, the concealment of matters; and fourth, the concealment of language." ○ Youxi says: "This is the title. *Brahmā* means the Dao. This chapter consists of the hidden and tabooed language of the Great Dao in the Thirty-Two Heavens, which cannot be fathomed." ○ Shaowei says: "The Great Brahmā refers to the qi of the Primordial Beginning’s Great Brahmā, which separates and combines to form sounds. *Brahmā* means 'pervasive,' for it is the same throughout the Six Directions. *Hidden language* refers to the secrets of the heavens, which worldly people do not understand. *Immeasurable sounds* means that beings of different regions and kinds universally hear the wondrous meaning without limit." In total, there are two hundred fifty-six characters, distributed among the Thirty-Two Heavens, with eight characters per heaven, and also inscribed upon the palaces and gates of the Mysterious Capital and the celestial towers. If one can ingest these characters, they will, according to their practice, ride the qi and return to their respective abodes. ○ Xuan Ying says: "When practitioners ingest these characters, on the day their merit is complete, they will ride the qi and return to their respective abodes. The method is found in the *Inner Sounds Jade Precepts*." The Middle Chapter of the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning The Eastern Master says: "This chapter’s text consists of two hundred fifty-six characters, each a square zhang in size, with eight radiating edges. First, they are distributed among the Thirty-Two Heavens, eight characters per heaven, to dispel misfortune and accomplish all salvation. Second, they are inscribed upon the gates, towers, and palaces of the Mysterious Capital and the heavenly abodes. If one cultivates and ingests these characters, they will ascend to those places and summon the immortals of the ten directions." The Dao Lord himself appended this beneath the title. The *Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning* refers to the sounds of the Eight Assemblies of the Primordial Celestial Worthy’s Numinous Writ, which exist within the Thirty-Two Heavens. Since they pertain to both principle and practice, this was compiled. ○ Shaowei says: "In the present commentary, I have followed the *Inner Sounds* explanations of the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, sometimes abridging to retain the essentials, sometimes adding characters for clarity. Where the scriptural text is rearranged and not in sequential order, the aim is to enable people to quickly grasp its meaning." Dǎnlóu Ācāng, Wúhé Guānyīn. ○ Shaowei says: "These eight characters are the inner sounds of the Yellow and Once-Heaven. *Dǎn* means vast and boundless. *Lóu* is the name of the long tower at the foot of the Jade Capital Mountain. It supports the Palace of the Mysterious Capital, also called the Tower Capital, for the mountain and towers rise in mutual prominence, vast and boundless. *Ā* is the name of the Ānà spirit in the Mysterious Capital, who oversees the tower’s surveillance and governs the qi of the Great Brahmā. When the qi’s cycles complete their circuit, the Ānà spirit sounds the drum of the Tower Capital to assemble the multitude of perfected beings and ascend to pay homage to the Primordial Beginning. The drum sounds once every three cycles as a regular observance. *Cāng* is the name of the terrace where the Celestial Lord roams; it is lush and luxuriant, hence called *Huì*. *Wú* means the Great Nonbeing; it is said that within the Great Nonbeing, the true sages naturally arise. The *Tai Xiao Lang Book* states: 'The formless gives birth to the true; the true arises from the formless.' *Hé* is the name of the gate of the sun and moon, where the sun and moon meet at the Hé Gate. *Guān* means observation and awakening; it is the taboo name of the Celestial Lord of this heaven, who oversees the records of the long night. *Yīn* refers to the sound of these eight characters. If one can recite the sound of these eight characters, then perfected persons will ride the golden wheel to open the dark, and jade maidens will wave flower banners to unfasten the locks. The Observer of Awakening oversees the records of the long night, delivering the four dark realms and the nine nether palaces, causing the seven ancestors to be illuminated and the decayed bones to live again." ○ Xuan Ying says: "The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign stated that these eight characters are from the *Flying Mystery Natural Writ*, each a square zhang in size, their radiant patterns shining brilliantly and illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Beginning transmitted them downward, instructing me to transcribe the characters, interpret their sounds, and compose the *Great Hidden Language of Brahmā* and the *Immeasurable Sounds* of the Yellow and Once-Heaven, entrusting them to the Dao Lord to teach those in the Yellow and Once-Heaven who are destined to attain the Way."

The *Immeasurable Cavern Chapter* is composed by harmonizing the flying primordial qi of the five directions within the Yellow and Once-Heaven with the natural sounds of the eight characters, and this principle applies to all heavens below. "Must extend the luminous head, the Dharma grasps the bodhi-dhāraṇī."

The Lesser Florescence says: These eight characters are the sounds within the Jade Perfection Heaven. *Must extend* (Xuyan) is the name of the northwest gate of the Kingly Perfection Heaven. When the great kalpas intersect, it is through *Must Extend* that they unfold. The jade perfected and supreme sages then turn to the *Luminous Head*, who is the capital warden of the Primordial Beginning. When the Primordial Beginning initiates the kalpa, the capital warden opens the Way, and the qi of Brahmā conduct swiftly illuminates of its own accord. *Dharma* refers to the field of the Dharma-wheel where sins and blessings are determined. *Grasps* (Lan) means awakening. This is the taboo name of the Heavenly Emperor within this heaven, who presides over the deliverance of souls and their rebirth. *Bodhi* (Pu) is bodhi. He wields the nine-colored banner. *Dhāraṇī* (Tan) is dhāraṇī. She holds the ten absolute banners, both being the perfected of the Upper Primordial. Those who constantly recite the *Cavern Chapter* will have the Dharma-wheel draw their register before the Controller of Destiny, awakening to deliver souls unto rebirth. The bodhi turns the nine colors in wheeling motion, and the dhāraṇī revolves the ten absolutes to halt the kalpa. Heaven and Earth thereby remain unshaken, and the myriad beings endure forever.

"Jiana Ayixi, Huhe Liuyin."

The Lesser Florescence says: These eight characters are the sounds within the Heavens of the Divine Youth. *Jiana* is the title of the Heavenly Master of Charts, the firstborn. He oversees the records of life and death, governs immortals and transcendentals, and presides over the Golden Flower Palace. The Golden Flower connects with the Dragon Mountain, resplendent above the Jade Purity and flourishing within the Cavernous Void. *Ayixi* is the name of a tree in the Seven Treasures Grove, whose canopy covers the four directions. It is the pleasure garden of the supreme sages and the playground of the perfected. *Hu* means awakening, the name of a flying heavenly spirit who governs the great and small kalpas. *He* is *Hemo* (Hā Mā), by which the heavens address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. *Liuyin* means to disseminate songs and chants. When the kalpa reaches its end, *Hemo* reveals the transformative teachings, universally delivering heavenly and human beings. Heavenly and human beings rejoice, and the myriad Dao flow freely. At that time, the heavenly kalpa contracts, the human Dao declines, and the coming kalpa’s destruction approaches, concealing the true scriptures. The Heavenly Worthy, foreseeing this, preemptively composes songs and chants. Those who constantly recite the *Cavern Chapter* will have the Master of Charts erase their sinful records from the long night and inscribe their names of life in the Southern Palace.

"Huadu Quli, Xianpu Yuzhen."

The Lesser Florescence says: These eight characters are the sounds within the Heaven of Level Nurturance. *Huadu* is another name for the Azure Flower Gate of the Great Ultimate Palace within the heavens. *Qu* refers to the heavenly Brahmā spirit-people flying above the Great Ultimate, singing the *Cavern Chapter*’s melodies amidst the qi of the refreshing numinous wind. *Li* is the name of the Jade Maiden of Supreme Harmony. *Xian* is *Xianyun* (auspicious clouds). *Pu* is *Pulou*, the name of a heavenly tower. When the Jade Maiden at the Huadu Gate chants the songs of the spirit-people, auspicious clouds unfurl in timely response, scattering above the *Pulou* tower. *Yu* is the hidden name of the Heavenly Emperor. *Zhen* means to arrive. The *Yu* Emperor constantly rides the eight-scene chariot, roaming beyond the eight poles, arriving at the abodes of ghosts and spirits. He revolves the ten absolute banners to summon heavenly demons and universally delivers heavenly and human beings. Those who constantly recite the *Cavern Chapter* will have flying heavens sing from afar, the three realms’ controllers welcome them, the seven ancestors emerge from the long night, and ascend to the Southern Palace.

"Da Luo Dafan, Sanyan Qingyun."

The Lesser Florescence says: These eight characters are the sounds within the Heaven of Literary Elevation. *Da* is the name of a jade tower within the heavens, serving as the convenient gate of the three realms. *Luo* describes the tower’s resplendent brilliance. *Great* (Da) refers to the Great Amnesty. At the beginning of the Heavenly Worthy’s kalpa, a great amnesty is always proclaimed, called the Great Amnesty, emptying the three evil destinies and halting the trials of the nine nether realms, granting them a new beginning. *Brahmā* (Fan) is the qi of Brahmā conduct, which can seal the Dragon Han kalpa and initiate the era of Red Clarity. *Sanyan* refers to perfected ones scattering incense in the jade tower. *Qingyun* (auspicious clouds) are those with all five colors, said to waft fragrance to brush the perfected, with auspicious clouds reaching the Purple Palace and flying heavens dancing in the empty wheel.

"Feisa Yudu, Mingmo Shangmen."

The Lesser Florescence says: These eight characters are the sounds within the Heaven of Māyā. *Fly* (Fei) is the title of the flying heavenly spirit-people. When the kalpa of heaven and earth changes and sinks into *Yankang*, the obscure qi opens, and the flying heavens reveal their light, scattering radiance so that all heavens receive qi. *Sprinkle* (Sa) refers to the swift revolution of the Dragon Han kalpa. *Jade* (Yu) is the sacred title of the Jade Perfected who opens the long night. *Capital* (Du) is Fengdu, the capital of the nine nether realms. Those with meritorious deeds will have the Jade Perfected open the gates of the long night, and Fengdu deliver them from the eight difficulties. The seven ancestors thereby return to life, and the hidden souls thereby shine forth. *Bright* (Ming) means to understand the meaning of the eight characters. *Demon* (Mo) is the demon king. *Supreme* (Shang) is the Supreme Emperor. *Gate* (Men) is the gate below. Those who clearly understand the meaning of the eight characters will have the demon king respectfully submit, and the Supreme Emperor nurture them at the Gate of the Spirit of Initial Life. Below the gate, the Han Lord Controller of Destiny and the Recorder of Registers calculate their deliverance in the Southern Palace, bestowing blessings upon the nine clans and granting grace to life and death.

"Wuxing Shangshou, Huizhi Liuxuan."

The Lesser Florescence says: These eight characters are the sounds within the Heaven of Transcendent Balance. *Wu* is the Upper Way, referring to the qi of the Primordial Beginning that illuminates the Upper Way of the Primordial. *Conduct* (Xing) is the guiding principle of the Heavenly Primordial, weaving the eight poles, pervading the Brahmā qi, and flowing ceaselessly. *Upper Head* (Shangshou) is the sin official of the Northern Dipper. He turns the celestial pivot, calculates the conjunctions and degrees, and when the numbers are exhausted, the great kalpas intersect.

"Return" (*Hui*) means to revolve. "Tread" (*Zhi*) means to step. At the inception of the kalpic revolution, the Primordial Beginning treads upon the void and wheels in revolution, disseminating transformation throughout the ten directions. "Flow" (*Liu*) is the radiance of the streaming dawn. It also causes the light of the streaming dawn to illuminate the repositories of the long night. "Mysterious" (*Xuan*) is the void. Above the Heaven of Transcendent Balance lies the Mysterious Capital’s scenery, where the Mountain of Empty Peaks stands—realm where the myriad sages wander and the living and dead return. When the Dao is not yet fully perfected, the body must undergo extinction; the soul ascends to the Empty Peaks, undergoes refinement, and is delivered to the Southern Palace.

*Ātuó Lóngluó, Sìxiàng Xūyuán.*

The Lesser Florescence says: These eight characters are the sounds within the Heaven of Obscuring Veils. *Ā* refers to the nine-fold mountains within heaven, linked in continuous ridges. *Tuó* is the tower upon the mountain, ascending to communicate with the qi of Jade Purity, gazing upon the realms of the Three Worlds. The Thearch constantly rides the cloud of Three Simplicities, driving the chariot of nine dragons, ascending the ridges of Ātuó, and descending to oversee the transgressions of the myriad beings. *Dragon* (*Lóng*) refers to Dragon Mountain, separated from Ātuó by ninety million myriad li. *Luó* is the name of the sun and moon. The *Jade Weft* states: The Perfected of the Nine Heavens of Upper Clarity call the sun *Zhuóyào*. *Luó* signifies the interlocking mountain forms, where the sun and moon shine above the peaks. *Four* (*Sì*) refers to the palaces of the Four Poles—Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numen, and Northern Perfection—where the Perfected of the Four Poles govern the registers of life and death. *Image* (*Xiàng*) is the wheel-chariot of images. The Perfected constantly ride these chariots through the Three Worlds, reviewing the records of life, death, and transgressions, and initiating the deliverance of those who study the Dao. *Exhale* (*Xū*) means to nurture. It is the taboo name of the Heavenly Thearch, who serves as the Deliverer of Destinies in the Southern Palace, presiding over the refinement and deliverance of decayed souls. *Round* (*Yuán*) means youth. It refers to the Youth Born of the Sun, who pours celestial nectar upon the heavenly beings. Those who recite and chant the cavernous scriptures shall have their jade names inscribed in the Thearch’s register; their lives and deaths shall be delivered in the Southern Palace, the Four Poles shall bestow upon them natural feathered chariots, and their seven ancestors shall rejoice and wander in the halls of fortune.

To the right, the Eastern Direction: the Nine Qi Azure Heaven, the spontaneous jade characters.

The Mysterious Splendor says: Heaven possesses eight characters, combining to form sixty-four sounds, also called the sixty-four chapters. According to the inner sounds of the jade characters, the esoteric incantation of the Eight Heavens of the East is called *Lingyin Bashu Liushisi Pian* (The Sixty-Four Chapters of the Eight Divine Sounds). Practitioners, according to what they wear and bear, embody the sounds of heaven. For example, when cultivating the Heaven of Sovereign Radiance, one wears and bears its eight characters. According to the first section of the *Inner Sounds Jade Characters Formula*: In the Heaven of Sovereign Radiance, the first, second, and third characters are all inscribed facing upward upon the Long Tower of the Mysterious Capital. Their script rectifies the celestial degrees and summons the divine spirits of the ten directions. The fourth and fifth characters are then inscribed upon the southern pavilion of the Thearch’s Wandering Terrace, governing the void wherein spontaneous divine Perfected are born. The sixth, seventh, and eighth characters are inscribed upon the gates of the sun and moon, governing the light that penetrates the obscure and opens the repositories of the long night. Each character measures one *zhang* square, their eight corners resplendent within the Heaven of Sovereign Radiance.

The Perfected Sovereign of Heaven says: To practice the Dao of ascending transcendence, on the ten fast days of the month, inscribe in cinnabar the first, second, and third characters of the Heaven of Sovereign Radiance, face *ren* (north) while wearing them, and recite the incantation as prescribed. After one hundred days, the myriad spirits shall attend your body. On the fifteenth and thirtieth days of the month, inscribe in cinnabar the fourth and fifth characters, face east while wearing them, and recite the incantation as prescribed. After twenty-four years of this practice, divine Perfected shall be born within you, and both in life and death, you shall ascend to the Thearch’s Wandering Terrace. On the waxing, waning, and full moon days, inscribe in cinnabar the sixth, seventh, and eighth characters, face the moon while wearing them, and after eight years, light shall emanate from within your body, your face shall turn golden, and both in life and death, you shall ascend to the abodes of the sun and moon, undergo refinement, and attain immortality. Those who bear these scripts shall have no further adverse records in the Three Bureaus; their names shall be inscribed in the Heaven of Sovereign Radiance, and through the revolutions of life and death, they shall endure for kalpas without end. This method is wondrous and profound, its merit equal to that of the flying transcendents.

To the right is a brief illustration of one heaven to clarify the principle; the remaining heavens for wearing and bearing follow the *Inner Sounds Jade Formula*.

*Southern Flaming Cavern Floating, Jade Eyes Gleaming Bright.*

The Lesser Florescence says: These eight characters are the inner sounds of the Heaven of Harmonious Yang. *Southern Flaming* refers to the southern Flowing Fire Court, seventy thousand *li* in breadth, its flying flames resplendent in the eight directions. *Cavern Floating* refers to the Cavern Yang Palace, where the qi of flowing fire blazes and floats. *Jade Eyes* is the essence of flowing fire. When the body is refined, jade-like radiance is born, bright as the pupils of the eyes—hence, *Jade Eyes*. The Perfected of the Southern Culmen govern within the palace, and all practitioners who first attain the Dao proceed to the Flowing Fire Court. The Perfected of the Southern Culmen then washes and refines them with the fire’s essence, scouring away the dust and filth, allowing them to become companions of the Perfected. *Gleaming bright* describes their multitude. The Brahmanic form falls into the void, the Nine Numinous Ones propel them forward.

Minor Tenuity said: These eight characters are the inner sounds of the Reverent Florescence Heaven. *Brahmanic form* was the title of the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning in the Dragon Han kalpa. By the Crimson Clarity kalpa, he was called the Nameless Lord; when the High Sovereign inaugurated the kalpic movement, he was titled the Primordial Venerable. His Brahmanic qi transforms his form, manifesting through kalpic changes with a single spirit—unborn of womb-gestation—hence, *Brahmanic form*. *Falls into the void* describes how the Primordial Beginning arises from the void itself. *Nine Numinous Ones* are the Nine Radiant Perfected. They govern within the Southern Superior Palace, presiding over the karmic records of deceased souls in the Nine Glooms. *Propel them forward* refers to the Nine Radiant Perfected, who oversee the ledgers of destiny, calculating the merits of souls’ past lives. In heaven stands the Scattered Flowers Terrace, where the Four Dipper Perfected reside. Those with virtuous deeds receive from the Four Dipper Perfected the talisman of extended life, and by its conferral, they are delivered from the Nine Glooms.

Marsh Luo’s Brahma Terrace, the Green Gauze of the Great Thousand.

Minor Tenuity said: These eight characters are the inner sounds of the Ancestral Fluttering Heaven. *Marsh* is the name of a mountain in heaven. Upon this mountain lies the cavern of the host of dragons, within which stands the Yellow Chamber, also called the Jade Countenance Hall. *Luo* is the inner name of the Perfected of the True Dawn. He governs within the Yellow Chamber, enduring through the great kalpas without end, persisting through the Dragon Han with ever-greater clarity—thus, the Glooms hold joy for him. *Brahma* is the hidden title of the Flying Celestial Perfected, who number beyond count. *Terrace* is the Jade Terrace, situated on the southern face of Marsh Mountain. *Green Gauze* refers to the Lady of the Moon, whose name is Luo Ying. Her countenance is like jade, and she wears a green mantle and azure robes—hence, *Green Gauze*. She governs within the Palace of Sun and Moon, ascending the Great Brahma Heaven of the Dao’s qi, the gate of kalpic movement, aligning with the reckoning of heaven and earth until the great kalpa’s end. Having received the conjunction of sun and moon, she then meets upon the Jade Terrace.

The Great Thousand denotes the reckoning of worlds. Master Lu states: "Counting a thousand thrice—first to a thousand, then a thousand thousands, yields the Lesser Thousand. Counting the Lesser Thousand to a thousand yields the Middle Thousand. Counting the Middle Thousand to a thousand yields the Great Thousand. Thus, the greatest of thousands is called the Great Thousand." Should one recite and chant the Cavernous Chapters, one may then ride the feathered-wheel chariot, ascend to the chambers of the Yellow Chamber, wander atop the Jade Terrace, and behold the realms of the Great Thousand.

*"Vast and boundless, the Nine Shameful Ones—
Vernal hymns weave through the winding paths."*

Master Shaowei says: These eight characters are the celestial sounds of the Imperial Reed Heaven. *Vast* (眇) means "dim and distant." In ancient times, the Primordial One sank into the midst of Yan Kang, where the celestial script of jade characters lay veiled and unmanifest—dim and distant indeed. *Boundless* (莽) refers to the Dragon Han’s opening of the kalpic movement, when its texts shone forth once more, vast and resplendent. Should one encounter the Way, both men and women shall live for thirty-six thousand years. When this kalpic movement reaches its end, another kalpa shall pass, and the Nine Qi shall each give birth to a beast to harm the wicked. Once the kalpa unfolds, these nine beasts are called the Nine Shameful Ghosts. The Northern Emperor and the Perfected of the Upper Realms preside over the Registers of Life and Death, thus establishing the Nine Shameful Ones to assist the Three Officials. When the reckoning reaches eighty-one myriad, the convergence of celestial qi is measured, and the Nine Shameful Ones shall be deemed fit to assist, styled the Envoys of the Nine Capitals.

*Vernal* (韶) is the inner name of the Divine Sovereign of the Imperial Reed Heaven. The Divine Sovereign of the Divine Empyrean is the spirit of the Demon King, who constantly tests whether those who study the Way are upright or not. The Demon King ever composes ballads to disturb the human heart. Should one’s heart remain steadfast, the king shall commend them and swiftly ascend to the midst of the Imperial Reed Heaven. *Winding paths* (缘邅) is the inner taboo of the Lords of the Southern and Northern Dippers. Should one’s meritorious deeds be recorded by the Southern Dipper, it shall deliver them from the trials of the Three Realms, rescue them from the sufferings of the Nine Glooms, and report to the Demon King, who shall not dare to harm them. Should one commit evil, the Three Officials shall record their sins before the Northern Dipper, which shall then report to the Demon King, who shall annihilate their souls and consign them to the depths of the Nine Glooms, bound to the labors of the Long Night for ten thousand kalpas without end.

Above the Imperial Reed Heaven lies the Mountain of Golden Splendor, upon which stand the palaces of the Five Emperors. There, five-colored clouds ever arise, with the sun and moon flanking its sides, and flying immortals attending its radiant chariots. Once their studies are complete and the Way is attained, all shall journey to the Mountain of Golden Splendor to receive the token of the Grand Unity, thereby commanding the Divine Sovereign of the Divine Empyrean and vanquishing the trials of the Great Demon. Only then may they ride the luminous-wheel chariot and wander the eight directions in revelry.

The Nine Qi, according to the *Scripture of the Orthodox Methods of the Three Heavens*: The Primordial Qi gives birth to Three Qi—first, the Crimson Cavern; second, the White Luminance; third, the Pure Vastness. The Primordial Qi further gives birth to Three Qi—first, the Verdant Radiance; second, the Yellow Effulgence; third, the Azure Chaos. It is also said: The White-Concealing Mysterious Qi gives birth to Three Qi—first, the Purple Fusion; second, the Azure Flame; third, the Black Flow. These are called the Nine Qi.

*"Above the clouds, the Nine Capitals—
Flying immortals arise in soaring flight."*

Master Shaowei says: These eight characters are the celestial sounds of the Hall of Radiance Heaven. *Above the clouds* (云上) is the inner taboo of the Divine King of the Flying Heavens. It opens the kalpa of the Dragon Han, inaugurates the movement of the Crimson Clarity, unfolds the books of spontaneity, and establishes the roots of heaven and earth. The *Nine Capitals* (九都) are the nine-tiered terraces that arise once the Three Images divide, situated upon the Mountain of the Jade Capital, resplendent above the Void Mystery. The divine beings of the Flying Heavens ever scatter the hundred harmonies of incense and stream the blossoms of the five clouds to behold the Flying Celestial Perfected. Atop the terrace stands the Jade Lad of the Grand Perfected, who thrice daily revolves the Ten Absolute Banners. With each revolution of the banners, the Celestial Thearchs of the myriad heavens thrice ascend the Mysterious Terrace; circling the terrace thrice, they recite and chant the Cavernous Chapters.

*Flying immortals* (飞生) is the name of the spirit of renewed life in the Southern Upper Realm. Should a scholar recite the Cavernous Chapters with a voice that reaches the Upper Palaces, the myriad heavens shall rejoice, and the Flying Immortals shall open the path of deathlessness, streaming the qi of long life to refine the Five Souls below. Once the Five Souls are refined, the Eight Radiant Ones shall abide within. *Arise* (自) means "to follow." *Soaring flight* (骞) refers to the Forest of Soaring Flight. Once they together elevate the human body to ascend the nine-tiered Mysterious Terrace and wander beneath the Forest of Soaring Flight, girded with the celestial script and reciting the Cavernous Chapters from their lips, after twenty-four years, they shall ascend to pay homage at the palaces of the Mysterious Capital.

*"Nurturing fragrance, the Wheel of Dharma turns—
Mara’s law revolves in ceaseless motion."*

Master Shaowei says: These eight characters are the celestial sounds of the Upright Tranquility Heaven. *Nurturing* (那) is the inner name of the Attendant Gentleman of the Celestial King. He governs the qi of the four seasons of heaven, the guiding principles of the Dao’s emptiness and non-being, and rectifies the divisions of the Upright Tranquility Heaven. *Fragrance* (育) is the name of the Wheel of the Celestial Pass. *Luxuriant* (郁馥) is the name of the numinous youth within the Dipper. Ever revolving the Nurturing Wheel within the Great Non-Being, turning it ten times to summon the Perfected of Heaven—when the Wheel of the Pass turns ten times, the Great Sages of the ten directions ascend to pay homage to the Jade Emperor, and the myriad spirits all arrive as Luxuriant sings the rites. *Mara* (摩罗) is the inner taboo of the Great Demon of Heaven. At Luxuriant’s first chant, the Demon King binds his form. Should a scholar know the qi of the four seasons and the turning of the Ten Passes, they shall enter the gate of the Wheel of Dharma, ride the chariot of the Eight Radiant Ones, ascend to the midst of the Jade Clarity, and pay homage atop the Terrace of the Purple Tenuity.

*"Holding the mirrorless, seizing form to move countenance."*

Master Shaowei says: These eight characters are the celestial sounds of the Reverent Celebration Heaven. *Holding* (霐) is the inner name of the Supervising Divine Overseer of Heaven. *Holding* (持) is the name of the Dragon Abyss, wherein the myriad dragons coil, ever driving golden jars to convey the blossoms of the Eastern Well and irrigate the Celestial Perfected. *Blossoms* (华) are the essence of the Yellow Blossoms within the sun, which pour into the streams of the Eastern Well, the inexhaustible source of celestial fluid. *Mirrorless* (无镜) is the taboo of the Divine King of the Flying Heavens. Wandering above the Great Empyrean, emitting light without color, he governs the registers of life and death and delivers those who study the Way. *Seizing form* (揽姿) is the name of the gate of the Three Realms. Should one know the name of this divine king, they shall open the storehouses of the Long Night, rescue the souls of the Nine Glooms, and deliver them through the gate of the Three Realms.

*"Conveying Countenance"* is the name of the Jade Maiden of Mystic Harmony. When one attains passage through the gate of the Three Realms, *Conveying Countenance* guides them with the crimson spirit-qi into form, while the fluid of Supreme Harmony irrigates their spirit. They ascend to the Hall of Fortune and Virtue, preserving their kalpic destiny without end.

*Fragrant Radiance, Vast Brilliance*—the divine sash emerges from the palace.
The Lesser Mystery says: These eight characters are the inner tones of the Jade Heaven.

*Fragrant Radiance* is the alternate name of the Mystic Terrace of the Jade Capital in Heaven. The Western Numinous Perfected constantly recites the cavernous scriptures while wandering above it. *Vast Brilliance* is the inner name of the Heavenly Divine Duke, coeval with the Primordial Beginning, serving as the model of mystic qi and instructing those who study immortality. One who masters the sound of these eight characters will have the Divine Duke open the gates of the Eternal Darkness, allowing ascent into the Gate of Renewed Life and mounting the terrace of the Jade Capital.

*The Divine Sash* is the numinous youth of the Purple Tenuity Palace, who presides over the corpses of the extinguished. If one obtains the *Song of Boundless Chapters* of the Divine Sash, they shall return to form within the Chamber of Triple Refinement, receive the qi of spontaneity, and rejoice in limitless longevity.

Above: The three black cinnabar heavens of the southern quadrant, with their spontaneous jade characters.

*Tao-li Chan-yu, Po-ni Kau-tong.*
The Lesser Mystery says: These eight characters are the inner tones of the K’ung-sheng Heaven.

*Tao-li* is the name of the Southern World of Non-Ultimate. *Chan* is the kingdom of Tao-li, also called *Chan-li*. Above this kingdom lies the Cavernous Yang Palace, where floating embers form the Flowing Fire Court. The numinous scripture begins with refinement in the Flowing Fire, adorning and illuminating its radiance. Once enlightened, the kingdom of Tao-li transforms into the Hall of Fortune and Virtue, and all suffering souls attain passage into the Cavernous Yang Palace.

*Yu* is the inner name of the Southern Supreme Lord of Life. *Po-ni* is the numinous youth of the Fire-Refining Pool. *Kau-tong* is the demon-god of the Tao-li world, who constantly obstructs the paths of life. If one knows the name of the Lord of Life, they attain passage to the Cavernous Yang Palace, proceed to the Fire Pool for refinement, and are reborn into the kingdom of Fortune and Virtue—whereupon the demon-god submits. One who recites the sound of these eight characters will have the boundless numinous officials of the Tao-li world attend their body, escorting them directly to the Southern Palace, where immortals receive them. Within three years, they shall surely ride the cinnabar wheels of the Empyrean, ascending to the heavens of the Three Qi.

The Lesser Mystery says: These eight characters are the inner tones of the *Jiang-you* Heaven.

*Jiu-kai* refers to the great unfolding at the dawn of time, when heaven and earth were yet undivided. The revolving Three Qi opened into nine divisions.

*Fu* refers to the souls of the dark night, delivered by the perfected and thus called "floating." They ride the turning destiny to return and ascend to the fortune hall.

*Luo* is the Great Luo. It opens the great thousandfold world, summons the guests of rebirth, and leads them to the Heaven of Great Luo, where their registers are settled in the various palaces and their deaths erased in the Three Offices.

Azure phoenixes sing beneath its canopy, green mists and emerald peaks adorn its heights. Divine winds stir the fragrant herbs of reversal, and the *Sang-lin* resounds with a hundred pipes.

To the right: the spontaneous jade characters of the Seven Qi of the White Heaven of the West.

*Kun-mu Dong-fu, Xing-she Shang-xuan.*
The Lesser Mystery says: These eight characters are the inner tones of the *Yuan-dong* Heaven.

*Kun-mu* is the mother of the Nine Numinous Ones, the steward of the Great Yin. She governs the Eastern Sea’s *Fu-sang* and the abyss of *Tang-gu*, ever regulating the earth’s mechanisms and turning the wheel of primordial qi, ascending to correspond with the heavenly gate. When the heavenly gate turns, the earth’s axis moves, and with each revolution of heaven, the waters surge in three thousand three hundred measures. When the qi of heaven and earth intermingle, the nine seas merge into one, and the waters fill the sky.

The East is where the Eastern Sea receives its confluence, governing the source of the Yellow River. *Fu* is the water spirit. She presides over Mount Kunlun, consolidating the vast seas, damming the Eastern Well—thus the earth’s mechanisms do not sink, and the kalpa endures long. *Xing-she* refers to the time of calamitous convergence, when the Mother of Earth emerges above the Eastern River, summoning the Bird Mother with a phoenix chariot to welcome those who study immortality, ascending to the ruins of Kunlun. The Bird Mother is the steward spirit of water. *Shang* means the Mother of Earth ascends to the Lord Emperor to report the kalpa’s convergence, delivering those who study immortality, announcing their names in the Palace of the Dark Capital.

The divine king constantly dispatches him to guard the Three Realms, reviewing the registers of life and death, commanding demon kings to protect and deliver those who attain the Dao. *Miao* means "remote and lofty." Those who are protected and delivered ascend to the Feathered Forest to receive talismans and rise to heaven, journeying remotely through the cloud palaces. *Qi* is the cloud-qi. *He* means "to merge with the radiance." Having entered the Feathered Forest, they weave cloud-qi into robes, soaring to the Vermilion Palace to receive blessings in the Heavenly Hall, then ascending with the hosts of heaven, merging with the radiance.

*The Flying Heaven’s Great Ugly One, Overseer of the Upper Heavens.*

*The Flying Heaven* refers to the divine kings of the ten directions’ flying heavens. In the heavens, there is the *feixuan* qi, which coalesces into the scriptures of the Great Cavern. The divine kings of the ten directions constantly recite these scriptures in the empty firmament to harmonize the qi of spontaneity and guide those who study the Dao. *Great* is the general record of the Three Realms, governing the registers of life and death. *Ugly* means "elder." He is the demon king of the Three Realms, serving the Great Ugly One. If scholars recognize his tone, the demon king protects their authenticity, and their bodies ascend to the Three Clarities. *Overseer* is the official who governs the flying heavens, constantly gathering the qi of the eight assemblies to hasten the revolutions of heaven and earth, supervising the officials of the long night and delivering the souls of the Nine Darks. If scholars know the tones of heaven, the heavenly demons array their words, and the Great Ugly One commands the registers of immortals to ascend to the heavens.

*Sha-tuo Jie-liang, Long-han Ying-xian.*
The Lesser Mystery says: These eight characters are the inner tones of the *Changrong* Heaven.
*Sha* refers to the *Shalan* Palace in heaven, a detached hall of the Purple Tenuity, situated above the Jade Clarity, resplendent within the Purple Void. *Tuo* is *Tuoqiu*. The multitudes of *Tuoqiu* number in the countless millions, all newly delivered and attained. Their merits incomplete, they remain scattered there. *Jie-liang* means that at each kalpa’s convergence, the multitudes of *Tuoqiu* are measured by their merits, ascending to the Vermilion Mound Palace to receive blessings and become immortals. *Long-han* is the name of the first kalpa, when the Great Dao was pure and simple, its transformations effortless and unadulterated. *Ying* is the name of a flying god from the *Long-han* kalpa, constantly delivering the souls of the Nine Darks to ascend into the *Lan* Palace. *Xian* is the youth of the Southern Palace. When scholars attain deliverance, *Xian* refines their forms and delivers them above the Vermilion Mound.

*The Azure Fall’s Floating Li, Empty Song Preserves the Precious.*
The Lesser Mystery says: These eight characters are the inner tones of the *Yulong* Heaven.
*Azure* means that within the *Yulong* Heaven, azure mists constantly arise to shade the *Yulong* Heaven. *Fall* is the name of a flying god in the empty firmament, constantly riding a chariot of azure mist to wander the *Yulong* Heaven. Thrice daily, he leads the hosts of heaven’s sages to ascend and pay homage at the Seven Treasures Palace. *Floating Li* is the inner name of the Heavenly King. When the hosts ascend to pay homage, the Heavenly King rejoices. *Empty* is the name of the celestial attendant of dawn. *Song* refers to the melodies of the Cavern Chapters. When the attendant of dawn utters a cry, the numinous wind plays, and the sound forms the Cavern Chapters—hence *Empty Song*. *Preserves the Precious* means that if scholars know these eight characters, they ascend to the Southern Palace as guests of the flying heavens, preserving themselves through the endless kalpa. They treasure the spontaneous patterns—hence *Preserves the Precious*. This meaning differs from the chapter’s opening: if one attains the Dao without form, they merge with the cloud-qi, and the subtlety of emptiness—how could it be discerned? Thus, the *Cavern Chapters* say: "Soaring triumphantly through layered azure clouds, the net of *Luo* shines upon the Upper Mystery." The *Numinous Writ* also says: "The Numinous Writ glows brilliantly, illuminating the Great Void." Thus, *Fall* and *Empty Song* are not merely personal names.

*Wu-yi Wu-pin, Dong-miao Zi-zhen.*
The Lesser Mystery says: These eight characters are the inner tones of the *Fandu* Heaven.
*Wu-yi* is the inner name of the Heavenly King. In the *Long-han* kalpa, all karmic conditions were exhausted, and he transcended the courts of the Three Realms, ascending to the halls of the Great Void to receive the registers of the Nine Immortals and assume the title of Great Sage. At the dawn of the *Chi-ming* kalpa, the Primordial Beginning bestowed upon him the kingship of the *Fandu* Heaven. *Wu* is the *Taiwu* Perfected, who receives the Heavenly King’s talismans to deliver the souls of the long night. *Pin* means "to measure the sins and blessings of the dark souls." *Dong* means "to thoroughly understand past karmic conditions." *Miao* is the Hall of Wondrous Transformation. Once past karmic conditions are resolved, one enters the Hall of Wondrous Transformation. *Zi* means "with"; *Zhen* means "heavenly authenticity."

The *Taiwu* Perfected delivers the souls of the Nine Dark Realms, thoroughly discerning past karmic conditions. When all evil affinities are exhausted, he guides them into the Hall of Wondrous Transformation, uniting with the Flying Celestials to merge with heavenly authenticity.

The Primordial *Fan* is vast and boundless; in profound stillness, souls are delivered.
*Shaowei* says: These eight characters are the inner sounds of *Jiayi* Heaven.

*Yuanfan* refers to the qi of the Primordial Beginning and the Great *Fan*, which uplifts the essence of the limpid Han, soaring high and pervading the void, suspended yet never falling.
*Huimo* means distant yet unobstructed, existent yet as if nonexistent, subtle yet unnameable, wondrous yet untraceable.
*Youji* means profound and silent, inaudible and invisible, yet within it lies the true, and within the true lies the essence, mysteriously delivering the celestials and humans.

The Heavenly True August One says: The inner sounds of all heavens, being natural jade characters, are woven from the radiance of soaring mystery, harmonizing the sounds of the Five Directions. They arise above the Primordial Beginning and emerge within the empty vastness. Their script is profound and intricate, difficult to trace in detail. The Heavenly Worthy, in encouragement, commanded the elucidation of their meaning. As the mysterious statutes have their decrees, I dare not disobey the mandate. When I took up my brush, my spirit ascended to the Great Empyrean, refining both essence and coarse matter to the utmost of my heart’s contemplation. Once the August Way was made clear, all heavens rejoiced in celebration. Those who treasure it receive the descent of perfected beings; those who cultivate it undergo transformation in form. Its majestic numinosity is vast and boundless, beyond naming.

Above: The Five Radiant Mystery of the Northern Dark Heaven’s Natural Jade Characters.

The Dao says: These are the great *Fan* esoteric utterances among all heavens, the sounds of the boundless.
*Youqi* says: The thirty-two heavens each possess eight characters, together forming the great *Fan* esoteric utterances among all heavens, the sounds of the boundless. Thus, they are called the inner sounds of all heavens. This is the soaring mystery’s natural true scripture, born above the Primordial Beginning and issuing from the empty vastness. It shapes heaven and earth, responds to kalpas and eons. The Heavenly True August One also roughly grasped its purport. The old script was a full *zhang* in length and breadth. The Heavenly True August One once transcribed its text to establish the correct sounds.

*Dong* says: The Dao’s words are the words of the Most High. The "all heavens" refer to the thirty-two heavens. The "great *Fan* esoteric utterances" are the names of the Heavenly Emperors, all concealed and not manifest. The "sounds of the boundless" mean that the resonant chapters naturally resound through all heavens, hence called the sounds of the boundless—the old script is thus. The original script, with its eight-cornered characters, was a full *zhang* in length and breadth, each side a *zhang*, making it the foremost of the ten thousand virtues. The Heavenly True August One was an ancient high perfected. In the *Long-han* kalpa, he transcribed this script to serve as the foremost virtue among all heavens.

*Youqi* says: The original script’s old characters were each a *zhang* in breadth, with eight corners radiating light. Their literary brilliance shone resplendently, illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy then commanded the Heavenly True August One to compile these characters, explicate their meanings, and transmit them to the Dao Lord, instructing him to teach them to all heavens—those who attain the Dao, achieve perfection, and have their names recorded in the registers of immortals. The August One then examined and verified them. The Great Emperor appointed him to oversee the Dong’e Grotto.

*Shaowei* says: According to the *Inner Sounds Sutra*, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was seated in the *Bailing* Lodge of the *Chi-ming* world. At that time, clouds and mist surged for three days and nights, and the dark *yin* did not disperse. The Five Elders addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Today, while attending your seat, we have witnessed what we have never seen before. When the Heavenly Worthy expounds the teachings, rivers and seas fall silent, and mountains and peaks conceal their mists. Yet now, in broad daylight, the sky is overcast, and the celestials and humans are alarmed. We do not know the reason." The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Today, all heavens manifest auspicious signs, and numinous responses arise naturally. The jade characters blaze with brilliance, obscuring the light of heaven. I command all present to close their eyes and listen reverently." Suddenly, the celestial qi parted, the dark obscurity vanished, and five-colored radiance illuminated the ten directions. A spirit script, each character a *zhang* in breadth, appeared above the empty mystery. Its literary brilliance blazed, with eight corners radiating light, its luminous essence dazzling the eyes, making it impossible to behold. The Heavenly Worthy proclaimed to all: "This is the spirit script of the Eight Assemblies. Its characters have no fixed form; their purport is profound and intricate, difficult to trace in detail. Let them be transcribed and explicated." Thereupon, the Heavenly True August One received the Heavenly Worthy’s luminous command, annotating their sounds, distinguishing their divisions. The thirty-two heavens each possess eight characters, together with the soaring mystery’s natural scripture, harmonizing the qi of the Five Directions’ soaring mystery to blend with the sounds of the eight characters. This is called the great *Fan* esoteric utterances—these are the sounds of the boundless.

The *True One’s Five Teeth Sutra* says: Of the August One, none know the beginning of his attainment of the Dao. His body was nine *chi* tall, covered in dark hair, each strand over a *chi* long. In the time of the Yellow Emperor, he dwelled beneath the Absolute *Yin* of Mount Emei, his dwelling made of azure jade, his seat of yellow gold. He unfurled banners of patterned silk and burned thousand-fold harmony incense. His attendants were jade lads and maidens; his three seated guests were all called the Celestial Perfected Kings of the Great Clarity. The Yellow Emperor bowed twice and inquired of the Dao, receiving from him the scripture of the Five Teeth and Three Ones. Those who know its sounds and can purify themselves in fasting to recite it will have all heavens dispatch Flying Celestial Divine Kings to descend and observe their person, recording their meritorious diligence and reporting it to all heavens.

*Youqi* says: Those who know the great *Fan*’s esoteric sounds and can purify body and heart to uphold and recite them will have the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors summon the Flying Celestial Divine Kings of the Ten Directions’ boundless realms to descend to their chambers, observe their body and heart, list their meritorious diligence, and report it to all heavens. The myriad spirits will pay homage, and earthly deities will attend at the gates. The Great Merit Demon Kings will protect and recommend them as perfected immortals. Once their Dao is complete and they attain perfection, they will roam the Three Realms and ascend into the Golden Gate.

*Dong* says: The Golden Gate lies within the Nine Palaces of the Great Auroral Empyrean. Within it stands the *Qianlin* Tree, atop which perches the Golden-Winged Bird and the smelting pool. The Golden-Winged Bird weaves its feathers into immortal robes, ascending to the Nine Palaces.

Youxī says: Once the myriad spirits pay homage and earthly deities attend at the gates, the great demons of the Three Realms and Five Emperors will jointly protect and recommend them for immortal deliverance. Thus, their names shall be inscribed upon the imperial tablets, and their ranks recorded in the register of perfected beings. When the Dao is fulfilled through ten thousand recitations and a thousand meritorious deeds are complete, they shall ascend in cloud chariots to stand before the Emperor of the Golden Portal.

This sound repels all, dispels all, delivers all, and accomplishes all—it is the spontaneous sound of celestial perfection.

*Dong* says: It expels demonic thieves, averts misfortune, rescues lost souls, and fulfills all things—all by the power of this secret celestial script.

Youxī says: This boundless sound can drive away all spectral perversities, dissolve all calamities, liberate all from the cycle of birth and death, and perfect all celestial and mortal beings. Thus, it is called the *Celestial Perfected Writ*, the spontaneous inner sound of the jade script.

Therefore, when one recites it, flying celestials descend to observe, the Supreme Emperor chants from afar, the myriad spirits pay homage, the Three Realms attend in reverence, all malevolent forces bow their heads, and demonic spirits vanish of themselves.

Youxī says: If one can recite it, the divine kings of the Ten Directions will descend to observe, the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors will chant from afar, the myriad spirits and numina will pay homage, the demon kings of the Three Realms will flank and protect, all perversities will naturally bow their heads, and all ghosts and specters will surely perish.

The jade tones resound, and the Ten Directions grow solemn and clear.

*Shaowei* says: The celestial script is of jade, hence "jade tones." To chant and intone its pivotal verses is called "resounding."

Rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow the mist.

*Dong* says: All by the divine power of this scripture.

The myriad spirits tremble and submit; immortals are summoned and gathered.

*Shaowei* says: Thus, the jade groves vibrate with celestial resonance, the Ten Directions bask in the radiance of the Three Luminaries, rivers and seas still their winds and waves, mountains and peaks swallow the clouds and mists, the myriad spirits submit in awe, and immortals are summoned to one’s chamber.

Heaven is free of defiling qi, earth is free of demonic dust. Profound wisdom illumines the void, and the vastness of the Mystery is most mysterious.

*Dong* says: *Profound* refers to the profound numen; *wisdom* to sagely insight; *illumines* to penetrating clarity; *void* to emptiness; *vastness* to impartiality. It universally delivers all beings, embracing all without exception, liberating all things. *Most mysterious* refers to its depth and remoteness. The merit of this boundless scripture is profound and far-reaching—hence, "most mysterious."

Youxī says: At this time, heaven is free of defiling qi, earth is free of demonic dust. If one further unites profound insight with numinous wisdom, congeals the radiance of celestial light, and illumines the clarity of the empty void, then within the wondrous lies the most wondrous, within the mysterious lies the yet more mysterious—so abstruse as to be unfathomable. Thus, it is called the *vastness of the most mysterious*.

*Shaowei* says: Cultivating the life of profound wisdom penetrates the Three Clarities. *Vastness* is the deepest and most wondrous.

*Xuanying* says: This reveals the inner sound of the various heavens and the power of profound wisdom’s illumination. *Profound* means deep and unfathomable; *wisdom* means boundless illumination. Wisdom can illumine emptiness—hence, "profound wisdom." Lofty and limitless is called *illuminating the void*; shining above the Three Clarities is called *illuminating clarity*. *Void* means emptiness; *clarity* means purity. Boundless and infinite is called *vastness*. Within vastness lies true emptiness. Within the true lies the essence, and within it, the truth. It gives birth to true sages, neither existing nor non-existing, eternally serene and subtle, so profound as to defy comprehension. Within the mysterious lies the yet more mysterious—hence, "the vastness of the most mysterious."

The supreme sages, in their compassion, bestowed this true scripture upon the lower realms, arranging it into mysterious precepts to enlighten humanity and deliver all beings. Those who recite and wear its sacred writ shall, in accordance with the qi they attain, fulfill their merit and complete their deeds, ascending as ministers of the Golden Portal. Thus, through accumulated study, one becomes perfected; through attaining perfection, one enters sagehood. Born in heaven or born on earth, their efficacy is boundless. Those who know the sound of the jade script shall one day ascend with flesh and bone together. Scholars of the highest learning, strive diligently!

*The Supreme Wondrous Scripture of Boundless Salvation, Upper Chapter, with Four Commentaries, Volume Four* concludes.

**Scripture Exegesis**
This scripture was received by the Supreme Lord of the Dao from the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning and transmitted to the world. The Lord of the Dao composed three prefaces: the first, the middle, and the last.

The first preface begins with "The Dao speaks: Formerly, in the Azure Heaven of Primordial Beginning..." and ends with "facing east to recite the scripture."

The middle preface follows the "Hymns of the Three Realms" and comprises these two chapters, which are the most profound and luminous utterances.

The last preface begins with "Among the various heavens..." and ends with "the vastness of the most mysterious."

The scripture contains two chapters: the first from "The Primordial Beginning’s Mysterious Cavern" to "proclaiming the Upper Clarity," and the latter from "The Primordial Jade Calendar" to "calamities befalling the seven ancestors."

The great Brahmā’s hidden speech is not counted among these two chapters. Some mistakenly consider the scripture as one chapter and the hidden speech as two, but this is incorrect. The middle preface states that reciting the scripture ten thousand times enables one to attain the Dao and illuminate the most profound utterances. Thus, the hidden speech is abstruse and arcane, not part of the two scriptural chapters—this is evident. Those who study this scripture should revere it with unwavering faith. When merit is fulfilled and the Dao complete, they shall naturally comprehend the shared blessings of heaven and humanity, benefiting both the living and the deceased. How can one not be resolute? How can one not strive?

*The Record of Mysterious Efficacy* and *The Daoist Anthology of Verified Miracles* both contain accounts of those who attained verification through reciting this scripture. Those who seek communion with the true should recite it with reverence and diligence.
