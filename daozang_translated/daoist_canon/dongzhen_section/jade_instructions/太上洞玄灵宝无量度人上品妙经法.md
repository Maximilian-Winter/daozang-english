**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of Limitless Salvation, Upper Grade: Methods of the Scripture*
*Collected and Annotated by Chen Chunrong of the Southern Song*
*Five Scrolls*
*Source Text:* *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category

According to *The Methods of the Numinous Treasure Scripture*: There are nine grades of hidden merit, for dispelling calamities and averting disasters, as well as for personal prayer and blessings, delivering from distress and performing merit. Visualize oneself as the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Beginning, seated upon a five-colored lion in the void, dwelling within the radiance of the sun. For the parents of heaven and earth, the king, and celestial phenomena, recite with the voice. Recite in the upper cinnabar field four thousand times. For distress and others, recite with the mind. Recite in the middle cinnabar field three thousand times. For all departed and hidden souls, recite with qi. Recite in the lower cinnabar field three thousand times. Each visualization must be performed ten times. Ten recitations make one cycle; one hundred recitations make ten cycles. With every ten words, click the teeth to summon the spirits; with every hundred words, swallow saliva to harmonize qi. If a single character is mispronounced, recite the previous thirty characters again; if a character is skipped, recite the preceding fifty characters again. When reciting, do so in a low voice; when chanting, intone clearly, ensuring each phrase is complete. Do not rush or hasten for the sake of completing cycles. Always maintain a joyful spirit and soul, with fragrant qi flowing continuously, unbroken within the chamber. If one pursues ornate sounds and hastily completes cycles, there will be no numinous response—merely reciting the scripture with an empty corpse. This not only brings no benefit but also invites the transgression of frivolous recitation.

**The Immortal’s Brush Descends from the Jade Tablet**
Before the chaos divided, the spirit of unity dwelled within; after the great mass separated, the treasure of the three origins was embraced. Scattered, it becomes qi; gathered, it forms script. It pervades the empty and cavernous, weaving beyond the void and mysterious. The primordial net flows and unfolds, establishing the essence-root of heaven and earth; the myriad patterns expand, spreading the blood-vessels of yin and yang. The five scripts are universally planted, the three luminaries equally bright. It opens the thirty-two layers of heaven, condenses the hundred thousand myriad paths of qi, thereby preserving and regulating the kalpas, aiding and glorifying the imperial plan. It enacts the mysterious mechanism of reviving the dead and raising the deceased, serving as the essential wonder for entering sagehood and transcending the mundane. It expounds the Three Caverns, all speaking of action; it teaches a nation, all attaining non-action. Concealing the Numinous Treasure within the field of the body, receiving the millet-pearl in the ground of nature. With a single thought, enter the Great Floating Li Land; ascend the layered towers to mount the Terrace of Yu Luo Xiao. Constantly draw near to one’s own Void Sovereign, suddenly awakening to the Original Beginning within the mind. The boundless multitude of beings all become true immortals of deathlessness; the teeming host of spirits all proclaim the Great Sage of Eternal Life.

**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of Limitless Salvation, Upper Grade: Methods of the Scripture, Scroll One**
*Collected and Annotated by Chen Chunrong, Disciple of the Register of the Three and Five Capital Merits*

The myriad sages are revered, all perfected beings look up in admiration—supreme beyond supremacy, mysterious beyond mystery. *Dongxuan Lingbao* is the name of its rank; *Limitless Salvation* is the title of this scroll. It is the origin of all scriptures, hence called the Upper Grade; its efficacy is subtle and wondrous, thus it is a wondrous scripture.

**Preface to the Mysterious Chapters**
The Dao speaks: *You* script.
These are the words of the Great Dao Lord of Jade Dawn of Supreme Clarity and the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy. The Dao Lord prefaces the scripture, thus beginning with "the Dao speaks."
The Mysterious Master says: All instances of "the Dao speaks" are the Great Dao Lord of Jade Dawn himself expounding, not merely the beginning of the second chapter.

Formerly, in the Azure Heaven of Beginnings—
The Azure Heaven of Beginnings is the King of Ascending Victory Heaven.
The Empty Song of the Blue Vault, *Mao* script; the Great Floating Li Land, *Li* script—
Floating Li is the inner taboo name of the Jade Ascension Heavenly Emperor.
—received the *Upper Grade Scripture of Limitless Salvation* from the Original Beginning.
The Great Dao Lord of Jade Dawn, as the master of the Numinous Treasure teachings, is the disciple of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Beginning and the teacher of the Heavenly Emperor Lord of Grand Tenuity. He received the Upper Grade Dao of Limitless Salvation.

**Chapter on Initiating the Movement**
The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Beginning
*Annotation:* The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Beginning is the response-title of the Void Sovereign. From the true arises the response, thus it is called "attaining cultivation"; profound contemplation of the dark source is the unique possession of self-nature.
*The Scripture of the Cavernous Spirit* says: The wondrous image is formless; the response to stimuli has substance. The qi of true essence transforms into physical form.
When expounding this scripture, circumambulate ten times to summon the ten directions.
The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Beginning, as the ancestral master of the Dao and its methods, at this kalpic movement, unfolds the chart and issues the teachings, preaching the scripture and transmitting the Dao. First, he circumambulates to summon the perfected of the ten directions, then ascends the throne.
The method says: The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Beginning is the primordial spirit of one’s own original spirit, the master of the body.

**Chapter on the True Response**
At the beginning of approaching the throne—
*Zi* to *Wu* script, lifting.
The throne is the seat of the empty and mysterious. It speaks of just beginning to approach the seat.
The Great Spirits of Heavenly Perfection—
*Upper Clarity* script.
The perfected of the Upper Origin, the perfected of the nine grades.
*Imperial Annotation:* These are the high perfected who have transcended the Three Realms, without cultivation or attainment, without rank or karma.
The Lofty and Revered of the Upper Sages—
*Jade Clarity* script.
The sagely and revered of the Middle Origin, the sages of the nine grades.
*Imperial Annotation:* These are the upper sages who have cultivation and attainment, with rank and karma.
The Perfected of Wondrous Conduct—
*Supreme Clarity* script.
The immortals of the Lower Origin, the perfected of the nine grades.
*Imperial Annotation:* These are the perfected who are originally for original action, all residing in the realm of Jade Clarity, having transcended the heavens of the Three Realms.
This triad of titles of heavenly perfection, when compared to the body, pertains to the qi of the eight luminaries of the upper region.
An innumerable host arrives riding the void, soaring on vermilion clouds through the cinnabar dawn, in green chariots and jade wheels, with feathered canopies casting shade, streaming with jade radiance.
*Hai* script.
The streaming jade radiance is the nine-colored round image.
It is also called the qi of the sun and moon, the Numinous Treasure of heaven. It can be gathered and refined, ingested to become a perfected being.
The five colors flourishing, *You* script—

The void of Great Cavern shines resplendent.
*Chapter on Stabilizing the Ultimate* — *Method of Stabilized Contemplation*.
The realm of the Great Cavern.
For seven days and seven nights, the sun, moon, and stars of all heavens, the jade pivot and jade balance, all halt their turning.
The Mystic Master says: Since it speaks of the sun and moon halting their turning, how then are the seven days and seven nights distinguished? This arises from the wondrous efficacy and divine transformations of the Heavenly Worthy, the workings of responsive resonance in the mechanism of transformation. This subtle and marvelous sagely response is an external manifestation of the Heavenly Worthy: the sun and moon do not move, the stars do not revolve, the jade pivot and jade balance halt their turning all at once, and day and night are no longer apparent. Yet in truth, the inner workings of the governing power never cease for even a moment. Thus, the seven days and seven nights of Jade Dawn’s clarity are not to be compared with the seven days and seven nights of the human world. Speaking from within, the radiance of great stabilization, utterly serene, reveals the realm of Jade Clarity—this is the achievement of seven days and seven nights. The halting of the sun and moon’s turning is the unblinking of the two eyes. It is neither closed-eyed darkness, nor inner vision, nor gazing with open eyes, but rather the prolonged gaze of seven days and seven nights, ceasing all blinking, illuminating the three regions so that within and without are wholly radiant. The qi and blood of the entire body circulate through the hundred joints and meridians, the yin and yang constructive and defensive systems, all bound to the pulse and breath of the three regions. This breath is the jade pivot and jade balance of the human body. The four extremities constitute the jade pivot; the three regions, the jade balance. Since the jade pivot does not revolve, the sun and moon pause in their course, the stars halt their turning, the four extremities do not reach, and the three regions do not breathe—thus the qi and blood of the entire body cease their circulation.
*Imperial Annotation:* Utterly still in profound stabilization, merging with the spirit and qi.
The four stars form the jade pivot; the three stars, the jade balance.
*Diagram of the Jade Pivot and Jade Balance*
One inhalation and one exhalation reach the four extremities, totaling six inches. One inhalation reaches two extremities, one exhalation reaches two extremities, each measuring three inches. Each extremity spans fifteen divisions, weaving heaven and earth in fifteenfold warp and weft—thus did the Supreme Thearch bestow the *Yellow River Chart* upon the Yellow Thearch.
The *Esoteric Essentials of the Numinous Treasure Elixir* states: The coming and going of the single qi of the human being is none other than breath. Each inhalation and exhalation constitutes one breath. Within a single breath, yin and yang are distinguished: exhalation is bright, yang, and day; inhalation is dark, yin, and night. The exhalation of the seven apertures is the seven days; the inhalation of the seven apertures is the seven nights. When the celestial mechanism is unmoving, the spirit congeals and the gaze is fixed, the pulse stabilizes and the heart stills—thus for seven days and seven nights, the sun, moon, and stars, the jade pivot and jade balance, all halt their turning at once. The divine wind is hushed and silent, without the stirring of exhalation or inhalation.

Mountains and seas conceal the clouds—*Zi* script.
Without obstruction, deluded thoughts and karmic deeds dissolve.
The heavens, free of drifting veils, are limpid, luminous, and profoundly still.
The Four Blacks yield to clarity—*Mao* script.
Naturally, warmth, coolness, cold, and heat arise.

A kingdom’s land is like a single body.
Its mountains, rivers, forests, and trees are as the four limbs and hundred vessels,
its hair, pores, and orifices as the *ying* and *wei*,
its bones and joints as the framework.
All is level and uniform, without high or low.
The earth is transformed into green jade, without variation in hue.

Entering the realm of Daoist samādhi,
the profound essence of the body is serene.
Within and without, the entire form becomes like green jade,
without a speck of dust.

The Mystic Master says:
In seven days of meditative contemplation, one loses awareness of day and night.
Observing the heart as no-heart, one knows the heart of true origin.
Observing form as no-form, one recognizes the original true form.
When both heart and form vanish, one naturally enters the formless Dao.
This is the great samādhi.
The divine radiance is profoundly still,
and the Jade Clarity realm is revealed—
the fruit of seven days and seven nights’ practice.

The Host of Perfected Ones attends in audience—*Jade Clarity* script.
When the Heavenly Worthy invokes the Great Dharma,
the Perfected Ones of the ten directions respond and assemble,
just as when the spirit and qi are gathered into the Sea of Qi,
and breath is stored in the Cinnabar Field,
the thirty-six thousand spirit-officials attend at one’s left and right.

**Chapter of Returning to the Origin**
The Primordial Heavenly Worthy sits in profound stillness atop a floating five-colored lion—*Wu* script.
The Mystic Master says:
The Heavenly Worthy’s floating stillness is one’s own original spirit abiding in the Jade Clarity Palace.
The profound sitting is the Dharma-body’s dominion.
The lion is the majestic power of the Primordial Beginning.
When the five qi pay homage to the Crimson Palace,
the wondrous transformation of majestic power coalesces into a lion.
The Heavenly Worthy rides it down into the Cinnabar Field—
left blue, right white, front red, rear black, center yellow—
thus forming the five-colored lion, the image of the Five Agents.
After expounding the scripture once, the Heavenly Hosts and Great Sages all praise its excellence.

At that time, the deaf and ailing of the entire kingdom regain their hearing.
Heaven engenders Water—
the qi of *Kan* is conceived within the Metal of *Qian*.
When the Heavenly Hosts and Great Sages all praise its excellence,
the myriad spirits rejoice as one.
The men and women of the kingdom are the yin and yang qi of the Dharma-body.
The deaf and ailing correspond to *Kan*, which governs the ears.
The Mystic Master says:
In the discourse of the Supreme Dao,
ignorance of sound is not knowing the true malady beyond sound.
Not listening to the soundless, the profoundly wise are also deaf.
The *Imperial Commentary* asks: What is deafness?
It is the ear’s lack of the virtue of hearing.
Upon hearing the Heavenly Worthy expound the Dharma,
the heavenly ear opens, and the Dharma-sound flows unimpeded, perfectly clear.
The rest follows this principle.

After expounding the scripture a second time, the blind regain their sight.
Earth engenders Fire—
the qi of *Li* is conceived within the Wood of *Xun*.
*Li* governs the eyes, which correspond to the heart.
When the heart is deluded by phenomena, it darkens like blindness.
Following the Dao in practice, the heart opens and the mind awakens—
nothing can obscure or mislead.

After expounding the scripture a third time, the mute can speak.
Heaven engenders Wood—
the qi of *Zhen* is conceived within the Water of *Gen*.
*Gen* is the mountain, where earth is thick and high, and springs emerge.

After expounding the scripture a fourth time, the lame and those afflicted with chronic ailments all rise and walk.
Earth engenders Metal—
the qi of *Dui* is conceived within the Earth of *Kun*.
To rise and walk is the nature of standing upright, akin to Wood.

After expounding the scripture a fifth time, those suffering from long-standing illnesses all recover their forms.
Heaven engenders Earth—
the qi of Earth, lodged in *Wu*, is conceived within *Li*.

After expounding the scripture a sixth time, white hair returns to black, and fallen teeth regrow.
Heaven engenders Water, completed by the sixth of Earth.

After expounding the scripture a seventh time, the old return to youth, and the young grow strong.
Earth engenders Fire, completed by the seventh of Heaven.

After expounding the scripture an eighth time, pregnant women, birds, and beasts—
whether their offspring are born or unborn—
all attain full development.
Heaven engenders Wood, completed by the eighth of Earth.
Returning to the East, *Zhen* becomes cinnabar—
*Gen* and *Zhen* unite, and Wood is perfected in Water.
Cinnabar is mercury responding to the qi of lead and congealing.

After expounding the scripture a ninth time, the earth’s hidden treasures are revealed, and gold and jade appear.
Earth engenders Metal, completed by the ninth of Heaven.
Returning to the West, *Dui* becomes Metal—
*Kun* and *Dui* unite, and Metal is perfected in Earth,
for mercury returns to the earthen crucible to become treasure.

After expounding the scripture a tenth time, withered bones revive and rise as living people.
At that time, every man and woman in the kingdom turns their heart in devotion,
all receive protection and deliverance, and together attain longevity.
Heaven engenders Earth, completed by the tenth of Earth.

The Mystic Master says:
When the Heavenly Worthy expounds the scripture ten times,
it is the Dao of the Five Agents’ generation and completion—
first the generating numbers of the Five Agents, then their completing numbers,
the ten revolutions of the returning spirit.
To illuminate this Dao is to attain longevity;
to apply it is to realize these ten wondrous accomplishments.

**Chapter of the Profound Mystery**
The Dao speaks:
At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy recapitulated the Heavenly Worthy’s circuit of scripture-expounding,
invoking the affairs of the ten directions.
The sequence of directions is reaffirmed.

After expounding the scripture once—*Zhen* script—
the East:
the boundless, immeasurable hosts of the supremely true and great,
the innumerable assembly, arrive floating through the void.
From the *Tai’an Tang* village, the *Nashan* world.

After expounding the scripture twice—*Li* script—
the South:
the boundless, immeasurable hosts of the supremely true and great,
the innumerable assembly, arrive floating through the void.
From the *Wanli* city precinct, the *Qixian* world.
(One version reads *Wanli*; another, *Wanli*.)

After expounding the scripture thrice—*Dui* script—
the West:
the boundless, immeasurable hosts of the supremely true and great spirits,
the innumerable assembly, arrive floating through the void.
From the *Futang* isle, the *Xianxing* world.

After expounding the scripture four times—*Kan* script—
the North:
the boundless, immeasurable hosts of the supremely true and great spirits,
the innumerable assembly, arrive floating through the void.
From the *Yudan* wilderness, the *Qingjing* world.

After expounding the scripture five times—*Gen* script—
the Northeast:
the boundless, immeasurable hosts of the supremely true and great spirits,
the innumerable assembly, arrive floating through the void.

The *Fuji* village, the *Chang’an* world.
After expounding the scripture six times—*Xun* script—
the Southeast:
the boundless, immeasurable hosts of the supremely true and great spirits,
the innumerable assembly, arrive floating through the void.
From the *Yuanfutian Yongxian* world.

After expounding the scripture seven times—*Kun* script—
the Southwest:
the boundless, immeasurable hosts of the supremely true and great spirits,
the innumerable assembly, arrive floating through the void.
From the *Yanfu* village, the *Renjing* world.

After expounding the scripture eight times—*Qian* script—
the Northwest:
the boundless, immeasurable hosts of the supremely true and great spirits,
the innumerable assembly, arrive floating through the void.
From the *Fude* wilderness, the *Yanxian* world.

After expounding the scripture nine times—*Xu* below, *Hai* above—
the Above:
the boundless, immeasurable hosts of the supremely true and great spirits,
the innumerable assembly, arrive floating through the void.
From the palaces and towers of all the heavens.

After expounding the scripture ten times—*Chen* above, *Si* below—
the Below:
the boundless, immeasurable hosts of the supremely true and great spirits,
the innumerable assembly, arrive floating through the void.
From the ninefold abysses of *Dongyuan*, the four tones of the wandering Brahma,
the thirty-six palaces, the earthly bureaus, the northern *Feng* courts.

When the ten recitations are complete, the supremely true and great spirits of the ten boundless directions arrive all at once. The men and women of the land turn their hearts in reverence, coming like fine rain or dense mist—an innumerable throng, filling half the kingdom, causing the earth to tilt and sink, beyond all restraint.

Then the Primordial Beginning suspends a single treasure pearl,
both hands lifting the *Yuqing* script.
It is as small as a grain of millet, hanging in the midst of the dark mystery,
five *zhang* above the earth.
The Dark Master says: The Heavenly Worthy enacts the wondrous, great transformation, suspending a treasure pearl in the dark mystery—none can fathom its tether.
The millet grain is the chief of the five fragrant grains.
Five *zhang* above the earth means departing the five desires, the five dusts, the five aggregates, the five colors, the five scents, the five sounds, emerging from the five turbid worlds, beyond the reckoning of the five phases—thus able to enter the wondrous mystery of the dark void.

Xue Youqi’s note: The treasure pearl is a metaphor for the Dao, akin to the meaning of the Dark Pearl. The millet grain, chief of the five grains, is the root of human life, signifying that one’s attainment of the scripture is as vital as rice to life. Once the five turbidities are transcended, all afflictions naturally cease; when the five phases are no longer employed, one forever escapes mutual harm.

Spontaneously attaining long life and enduring vision, one achieves the Dao and becomes a perfected being. The Primordial Beginning ascended and guided the Celestial Perfected Divinities, the Supreme Sages of Lofty Eminence, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Boundless and Utmost Perfected Divinities of the Ten Directions, and the innumerable hosts—all entering into the treasure pearl. Heavenly beings gazed upward, seeing only a surging movement as they entered through the pearl’s mouth; once within, their whereabouts were unknown. The Celestial Perfected and Supreme Sages, their *qi* harmonized with the wondrous Dao, their bodies united with the true Dao, were thus able to follow the Heavenly Worthy’s ascent into the dark void’s millet pearl. Heavenly beings, their bodies not yet united with the true, could not enter together but could only gaze upward.

Moreover, lesser immortals of lower rank possess the wondrous ability to contain Mount Sumeru within a mustard seed and suspend heaven and earth within a gourd—how much more so the Great Sage Heavenly Worthy, who unfolds and proclaims the great teaching, manifesting divine transformations! From the perspective of the utmost Dao, a kingdom is but an analogy for the body. Collapse and ruin signify that the Dao has faltered and narrowed, its unity incomplete, and thus it cannot be called the wondrous profundity of the dark mystery. Heavenly beings are the myriad spirits; the Celestial Perfected Divinities, Supreme Sages of Lofty Eminence, and Perfected of Wondrous Conduct are the spirits of the Three Primes; the Heavenly Worthy is one’s own primordial spirit, the master of the body.

From the perspective of the wondrous inner landscape of the Dao, this is the secret of the Jade Clarity treasure pearl’s immortal embryo transformation. The people of the kingdom disperse and scatter, the land returns to levelness, and no further tilting or sinking remains. Within the treasure pearl, the Primordial Beginning completed the recitation of the scripture in full, and the assembled perfected beings supervised its transmission to me. The Primordial Beginning expounded the scripture within the treasure pearl, and all the sages entered therein. At that time, only the Dao Lord was ordained; the Dao Lord received this scripture, and thus it is said to have been transmitted to me. “I” is the Dao Lord’s self-reference.

At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. The Dharma rites were roughly complete, and the various heavens returned to their positions. In the blink of an eye, all was silent, with no lingering echoes. At that time, the heavenly beings who encountered the scripture’s Dharma were universally delivered and saved, preserving their original years without harm or injury. The people of the fallen land returned to reverence, all cultivating kind hearts. They did not kill or harm, eliminating the sins of bodily karma; they did not envy or covet, eliminating the sins of mental karma; they did not lust or steal, eliminating the sins of bodily karma; they did not greed or desire, eliminating the sins of mental karma; they did not hate or resent, and their speech was free of embellishment and deceit, their mouths free of evil words—further eliminating the sins of mental karma.

These twelve great precepts must first be received and upheld by all who study and recite this scripture. With unified compassion and love, even those of different bones become kin; the kingdom is at peace, the people prosperous, and all delight in great tranquility.

The *Yanfan Chapter*:
When the scripture first emerged to teach the realm, all within the kingdom who possessed utmost sincerity, revered and honored it, and were delivered across the world.

The *Shuangshou Yuqing Wen* concludes here.

The *Xuanmi Chapter*:
The Dao states: All that the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy expounded within the scripture are the inner names and hidden rhymes of the Celestial Emperors of the various heavens. They are also the inner taboos of demon kings and the secret names of the hundred spirits—no ordinary words of the world.

The *Shangsheng Chapter*:
The Supreme Sages have already attained perfection...

The Supreme Sages merge profoundly with the wondrous Dao, their virtue and power perfected. The Perfected Ones fathom the mysterious and probe the subtle, mastering its chapters and reciting them tenfold in transgressions. Ten recitations make one transgression, a hundred recitations make ten transgressions—reciting the scripture should follow the method of ten transgressions. The myriad heavens chant from afar, the ten thousand emperors perform rites, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds. There is no inhalation or exhalation. The sun and moon halt their radiance, the eyes do not blink. The celestial pivot ceases to turn, the pulse does not rest—this is also the method of great samādhi. The host of demons bind their forms, ghostly spirits lose their clarity.

*Upper Clarity Text*
The Mystic Master states: The demon kings of the six caverns within and without the Fengdu Twelve Palaces are demonic spirits, also called the host of demons. These demons corrupt human goodness, cling to human evil, and test those who cultivate the Dao. In the world, there are birds and beasts, the essence of the Five Phases, which transform into ghostly demons. These beings take on different forms and kinds, yet their spirits are the same as humans. There are also heretical demons, bewitching spirits, and the suffering souls of ghosts who transform into Heavenly Worthies, divine immortals, and Perfected Ones to delude and confuse good people and Daoists. Be clear and discerning, lest you fall among this current. They turn corpses back to life and raise the dead, making white bones become human.

The Mystic Master states: The Perfected Ones who fathom the mysterious and probe the subtle, who comprehend the great cavernous secret taboos within the scripture, attain the merit of ten grades of spiritual response—this is the standard of the Perfected Ones.

*The Ultimate Study Chapter*
Those of ultimate study...

With hearts firmer than metal and stone, conduct more resolute than water and fire—such that neither Heaven nor Earth can surpass, nor ghosts and spirits delude—walking paths others cannot tread, treating existence as nonexistence: these are those below the Great Ultimate who bear the name of immortals. Recite this ten times, and the Five Emperors stand guard, the Three Realms bow in reverence, demonic essences lose their sight, and ghostly specters perish in spirit.

*Upper Clarity Text.* It delivers the dying and revives the perished.

The Mystic Master states: When Perfected Ones and scholars recite this, they attain the merit of the sixth grade. The reason lies in this: scholars’ impure qi has not yet dissipated, their bodies have not fully realized the True, and though they summon and command the Jade Clarity Texts of the ten directions, their power does not yet govern the celestial administration. The celestial administration refers to the sun, moon, five planets, and the seven celestial regulators. Their virtue may subdue earthly deities and bind demonic spirits—*Jade Clarity Text*—yet they can only avert death, not restore life. Scholars’ bones and bodies remain unrefined, impure qi still lingers, and they cannot command celestial phenomena, thus attaining only the merit of the third grade. This is the standard of the Perfected Scholar.

*Exhortation to the Dao Chapter*
To recite this chapter lightly brings calamity upon oneself. Those who recite without fasting, bathing, or burning incense incur the sin of misfortune. Those who honor it with reverence and offerings will see their households flourish, their generations prosper, and their good karmic connections endure. Ten thousand disasters will not touch them, and divine spirits will guard their gates.

*Jade Clarity Text.* Those who honor it with reverence and offerings attain the fivefold good fruit.

*Eulogy of the Mysterious Chapter*
This scripture is most venerable, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings and stands as the root of all Daoist teachings. Its majestic model is vast, its virtue beyond measure.

*Recitation Chapter*
The Dao states: For all who recite this scripture ten times—regardless of rank or station—those who recite it with wholehearted devotion according to the proper method will see all heavens assemble. Countless generations of ancestors, suffering souls in darkness, will all be delivered, ascending to the Crimson Palace, where they undergo transformation over nine years.

The Three Primes’ Precepts and the Crimson Mound’s standards for deliverance comprise five grades. Nine years marks the middle fortune; great fortune is three years, and lesser fortune is twenty-four. After transformation and rebirth, they become noble persons. If they then devote themselves to the study of the supreme scriptures, their merit complete and virtue perfected, they all attain divine immortality, soaring to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital.

The Mystic Master says: Even those who receive the scripture without cultivation—merely reciting it ten times—bring forth this mysterious response. This refers to the karmic reward of one’s own merit, delivering ten thousand generations of suffering ancestors to ascend to the Crimson Palace. According to the Crimson Mound’s standards, they undergo nine years of transformation, are reborn as noble persons, and if their innate wisdom is clear and unobscured, they may devote themselves to the study of the supreme scriptures. When their own merit and virtue are fulfilled, they ascend to the heavens of Upper Clarity, roaming and feasting in the Great Veil’s Jade Capital. This is the standard for all who recite it ten times.

*The Advanced Study Chapter*
Those of advanced study...

Those who hear the Dao and act upon it, who behold the Dharma and guard its esoteric studies, never wavering from beginning to end, unwavering through cold and heat—these are those whose names are recorded as immortals below the Nine Palaces of Great Clarity. Those who cultivate and recite this scripture, inwardly refining the Dao and outwardly reciting the text, are all immediately delivered and ascend to the Southern Palace.

The Mystic Master says: Those of advanced study both cultivate and recite, yet cannot deliver ten thousand generations of ancestors, only securing their own deliverance—this is the standard for superior adepts.

As for those of the world who recite it—these are ordinary people, not those who stand apart from the multitude. They extend their years and lengthen their lifespan, and afterward all attain the Dao of liberation through the corpse. Their ethereal souls temporarily dissolve, bypassing the hells, and immediately regain their forms, roaming the great void. Those who receive and recite the scripture from a master merely extend their lifespan and achieve liberation through the corpse—this is the standard for worldly people.

From the perfected to these, there are five ranks, each with its distinct gradations.

*The Unfolding Mysteries Chapter*
This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. All heavenly and mortal beings receive its blessings, and immeasurable fortune bestows grace upon the living and the dead.

*The Pledge of Devotion Chapter*
What heaven treasures is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted offer gold and treasures, pledging their hearts to heaven in transmission. Those who lightly disclose or neglect it bring calamity upon nine generations, consigning them to long servitude under the ghostly officials.

Previously, careless recitation brought misfortune upon oneself; now, careless disclosure brings misfortune upon nine generations.

The Mystic Master says: Those who lightly disclose, treat it with negligence, or violate the esoteric statutes—recklessly transmitting to the unworthy, failing to observe the prescribed years, or transmitting without purification, or pledging to receive it while leaking its secrets—causing others to treat the mysterious text with disdain and disbelief—all fall into the middle category. The calamity extends to nine generations, consigning them to long servitude under the ghostly officials, who oversee the labor of spirits in the earthly prisons.

They are made to sweep the Five Peaks, serve as laborers in Fengdu, alternately tend mountains and rivers—this is the labor of the ghostly officials. Some are driven to command thunder and lightning—this is the labor of the heavenly officials. Others bear sand and carry stones—this is the labor of the earthly officials. Still others draw water from the vast waves—this is the labor of the watery officials. These are the penal servitudes of the three bureaus.

*The Mystic Bureau Chapter*
Those who attend this scripture are served by the Five Emperors, twenty-four Jade Lads and Jade Maidens—Red Apricot and the Thunder Script, Ink-Black and the Kan Script.

**Grinding the True, Dui Script.**
**Wax-Linen, Li Script.**
**Numinous Treasure.**
With the Central Script, press and seal, draw the qi of the Five Directions and blow it forth. These are the divine talismanic texts of defense, guarding the body of the scripture’s recipient. The Central Script is then released.

From the East, nine qi: the Azure Numinous Dao Lads and Azure Numinous Jade Maidens.
From the South, three qi: the Cinnabar Numinous Dao Lads and Cinnabar Numinous Jade Maidens.
From the West, seven qi: the Radiant Numinous Dao Lads and Radiant Numinous Jade Maidens.
From the North, five qi: the Mysterious Numinous Dao Lads and Mysterious Numinous Jade Maidens.
From the Center, one qi: the Yellow Numinous Dao Lads and Yellow Numinous Jade Maidens.
Each direction sends twenty-four Jade Lads and Jade Maidens—two hundred forty in total—dispatched by the Five Elder Thearchs of the Five Directions to serve, guard, and protect.

The Mystic Master says: These are the spirits of the Five Phases, four seasons, Nine Palaces, and twenty-four qi, all dwelling within the body.

**The Three Primordials Chapter**
The Dao declares: In the first month, observe the long fast.
Fasting means the body is free of杂务, the mind does not stray outward, inner and outer are pure and empty, embracing the Origin and guarding the One throughout the month—hence it is called the long fast.
Recite and chant this scripture—
*Recitation* is done in a low voice, *chanting* is intoned with clear melody—
to sever the earthly penal servitude of the departed souls of former generations and deliver them to the Upper Southern Palace.

The Mystic Master says: The first month is the month when the Celestial Official of the Upper Primordial convenes with the Earthly and Watery Officials at the Upper Primordial Purple Tenuity Palace to review merits and virtues, a month of promotion and reward. It is fitting to deliver the departed souls of ancestors, severing their servitude in the Three Bureaus.

In the seventh month, observe the long fast, recite and chant this scripture, and the body attains immortality. The names are inscribed in the heavens on yellow registers and white tablets, erasing death and ascending to life.
The seventh month is when the Earthly Official of the Middle Primordial convenes with the Celestial and Watery Officials at the Middle Primordial Yang Terrace Palace to assess merits and transgressions, a month of celebrating life. It is fitting to deliver oneself, inscribing one’s name in the heavens to attain immortality.
The *yellow register* is the celestial golden register. The *white tablet* is the register of the dead. Thus, the golden register records the name of the living, while the white tablet erases the name of the dead.

In the tenth month, observe the long fast, recite and chant this scripture, to secure the throne for kings and emperors, rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, stabilizing the nation’s destiny, preserving the heavens’ eternal endurance, ensuring the ruler’s perpetual reign over the land and the people’s acclaim of great peace.
The tenth month is when the Watery Official of the Lower Primordial convenes with the Celestial and Earthly Officials, all the Perfected Sages and Immortals of the heavens, earth, and waters, the stellar lodges, palace bureaus, and ghostly administrators, to universally review all merits, transgressions, good, and evil at the Tailu of the Eastern Ultimate Heaven, the source of the draining waters in the Clear Cold Mansion. It is the month of the Great Assembly for Universal Review and Life’s Establishment. It is fitting to pray for the nation’s stability, the emperor’s sagely reign, and to pacify afflicted regions according to the rites, so the people may acclaim great peace.

Another method states: The first month belongs to *yin*, the ghostly path, hence it is for delivering the departed.
According to the *Oral Instructions for Visualization*: Water begins to generate, fire’s long-life phase is *yin*. With water and fire in harmonious balance, the dead souls are refined and delivered, their jade pupils tempered, their yellow essence purified of form.

The seventh month belongs to *shen*, the gate of humanity, hence it is for delivering oneself.
According to the *Oral Instructions for Visualization*: Fire’s completion number, water and earth’s long-life phase is *shen*. This is the completion number, thus one attains deliverance.

The tenth month belongs to *hai*, the gate of heaven, hence it is for securing the nation’s destiny for emperors above and preserving great peace for ministers and commoners below.
According to the *Oral Instructions for Visualization*: Earth’s completion number, wood’s long-life phase is *hai*. Wood is the ancestral qi, thus it pertains to fathers and sons. Earth’s completion number pertains to emperors and rulers of nations.

On the days of the eight nodes, recite and chant this scripture to become a Perfected of the Nine Palaces.
First, the Kan Script; second, the Kun Script; third, the Zhen Script; fourth, the Xun Script; fifth, the Central Script; sixth, the Qian Script; seventh, the Dui Script; eighth, the Gen Script; ninth, the Li Script—then press and seal the Central Script again.
The eight nodes are the days of the four *li* (seasonal beginnings), two *zhi* (solstices), and two *fen* (equinoxes). The Perfected of the Eight Directions gather to assess sins, blessings, merits, and transgressions at the Upper Primordial Eightfold Radiance Palace.
On these days, fast and abstain in the corresponding direction to dispel and exorcise the forty-five days of water and fire disasters, warfare, drought, and pestilence across the nine regions of the earth. Recite and chant toward that direction, aligning the palace with the established pointer.
Winter solstice: Kan governs. Spring *li*: Gen governs. Spring equinox: Zhen governs. Summer *li*: Xun governs. Summer solstice: Li governs. Autumn *li*: Kun governs. Autumn equinox: Dui governs. Winter *li*: Qian governs.
The eight palaces cycle in correspondence with the eight nodes, with the Central Palace being the self. Dwelling in the Central Palace, one guards the Five—thus becoming a Perfected of the Nine Palaces.
This is precisely the *Nine and One* of the Upper Clarity’s Ninefold Primordial Huoluo Dao: wearing nine above, treading one below, three on the left, seven on the right, two and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet, five as one’s belly.

**Diagram of the Eight Nodes and Nine Palaces**
On one’s natal day, recite and chant this scripture: the hun-soul and spirit become pure and upright.
The *Jade Clarity Script*—the myriad qi endure forever.
Free from suffering and affliction, the body radiates light.
The Three Realms serve as guards, the Five Thearchs oversee the reception.
The myriad spirits pay homage, the name is inscribed in the heavens.
With merits fulfilled and virtue perfected, one ascends to fly in the Upper Clarity.
From the *Jade Clarity Script* to the *Upper Clarity Script*, the seal is released.

On one’s natal day, the hundred spirits attend the body, revered by all heavens. On this day, cultivate and recite to restrain the hun-soul and po-soul, preserve life and pacify the spirit, purify the five viscera, and gather the myriad qi into the body.

**The Practice Chapter**
This chapter is to be silently recited and inwardly visualized, cultivated according to the method.
The Dao declares: On the day of practicing the Dao—
the day of reciting the scripture—
one must bathe in fragrant water:
the five-fragrance decoction—*baizhi*, *qingmuxiang*, white sandalwood, *chenxiang*, and *gansong*—brewed with east-flowing water.
The *Oral Instructions for Visualization*: incense above, fragrant bath below.

It is said: burn incense above and bathe in fragrance, then with the hand brush the incense into the nose, visualizing it entering the *niwan* at the crown of the head. Next, drink water below to bathe, as in the great bathing—solar bathing and lunar bathing—then circulate the sun to emerge from the left eye and the left *Taiyang*, above which is a crimson light that descends to form fire, merging with the fire of my heart to burn the body completely. Then visualize the radiance returning to rest above the sun’s *Taiyang*. Next, circulate the moon to emerge from the right eye and the right *Taiyin*, above which is a jade light that descends to form rain, merging with the water of my kidneys, washing my body in the great sea to cleanse the five viscera of filth and turbidity. Visualize the jade light returning to rest above the moon’s *Taiyin*. Sun and moon illuminate my body through and through, as if seated in the void amid clouds, without obstruction. Stabilize the mind and purify the heart.

Purification and precepts: purification means inwardly purifying the heart and outwardly purifying the form. Precepts mean inwardly holding fast to resolve and outwardly holding fast to conduct. The Mystic Master says: purification has four kinds—first, heart purification; second, constant purification; third, pure and undefiled purification; fourth, perpetual purification. As for precepts, the twelve great precepts are found in the scriptures, the unsurpassed ten precepts, and the nine numinous wondrous precepts, all detailed in the great methods.

Enter the chamber facing east: east is the direction of long life, revered by all heavens. When entering the chamber to recite scriptures, face east in welcome. Visualization: the oral instructions say one meaning is to summon the primordial spirits of the ten directions into one’s body, called "entering the chamber." Turning from death toward life is called "facing east." Another meaning is to enter a quiet chamber and face east. Both interpretations are used together, so inner and outer correspond.

Knock the teeth thirty-two times to reach the thirty-two heavens: knocking the teeth gathers the spirits. The method of knocking the teeth: the left is the *Heavenly Bell*, subduing demonic spirits; the right is the *Heavenly Chime*, gathering the hundred spirits; the center is the *Heavenly Drum*, attending the sagely perfected. Knocking the teeth is striking the Heavenly Drum. Visualize the sound like a drum, ascending to shake the crown of the head, resounding through the thirty-two heavens.

Bow in the heart thirty-two times: heart-bowing means not inclining the *niwan*’s nine palaces. Heart-bowing surpasses physical bowing; though the body does not move, the heart is humbled as if prostrating.

With eyes closed, visualize the thirty-two heavens, beginning at the northern quadrant with the *Great August Yellow Canopy Heaven*, then moving east to south and west, each direction having eight heavens within the azure clouds and five-colored mists, golden towers and jade halls, each with an emperor-lord, solemn and distinct. Next, visualize from the left ear’s cranial seam the eastern eight heavens, from the forehead the southern eight heavens, from the right ear’s cranial seam the western eight heavens, and from the back of the head the northern eight heavens. Then, beginning again with the *Yellow Canopy Heaven*, for each heaven’s name, knock the teeth once and bow in the heart once. Proceed through the second, the *Jade Perfection Heaven*, circling the four directions to the *Jia Yi Heaven*, totaling thirty-two bows.

According to the great methods, the *Yellow Canopy Heaven* governs the northwest of the northern quadrant, riding the *qi* of the *Kui* and *Bi* constellations in the northwest. Facing east to recite scriptures, the eastern eight heavens emerge from the left ear’s cranial seam because the *Yellow Canopy Heaven* begins at the northern quadrant.

**Diagram of the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Positions**
For all recitation, rely on this diagram, practicing visualization until thoroughly familiar, knowing the heavens’ locations. When raising the mind and directing intention, all is clear and distinct, avoiding hesitation or doubt at the moment.

Close the eyes and still the mind, visualizing the spirits and stabilizing resolve to enter the wondrously subtle and marvelously transformed realm.

Closing the eyes is the gathering of vision. When vision is gathered, the spirit returns to inward contemplation. Stillness of thought means the mind does not stray outward, focusing solely on the spirit.

The body sits amidst the *qi* of the three colors—azure, yellow, and white—enveloping both within and without in misty obscurity. Press the tongue to the upper palate and first close the *qi* for twelve breaths. Visualize the three *qi* within the Three Primordial Palaces, penetrating the five viscera. Envision the white *qi* of the Lower Primordial Elixir Field Palace ascending to merge with the yellow *qi* of the Middle Primordial Crimson Palace, blending as one. Then visualize the yellow and white *qi* of the Middle Primordial ascending to unite with the azure *qi* of the Upper Primordial Mud Pill Palace, merging as one. The three *qi* emerge from the crown of the head, filling the chamber, interweaving with the body’s form, suffusing the seat in natural obscurity.

The Mystic Master said: The Mystic *qi* is azure, the Primordial *qi* is yellow, and the Initial Boundary is white—these are the three *qi*, all born from the One *qi*. Now abiding within the three *qi*, one practices the adept’s way of preserving the Three while guarding the One. The One is the mother of *qi*, the Way of true constancy.

**Oral Instructions for Visualization:**
The *qi* of the three colors—azure, yellow, and white—are the primordial *qi* of the Most High, the Three *qi* of the Mystic, Primordial, and Initial. When heaven and earth first arose, the three *qi* congealed and coalesced. Thus, the practitioner of scripture recitation sits amidst the three *qi*. Azure is the *qi* of the east, hence it lies before the adept; yellow is the *qi* of the center, hence it resides where the adept sits; white is the *qi* of the west, hence it lies behind the adept. Why not speak of the red and black *qi*? They are water and fire. Before heaven and earth were born, these *qi* already existed; when heaven and earth first arose, these *qi* had yet to take form. Once the Four Symbols emerged, the two *qi* became manifest as the sun and moon.

The misty obscurity arises from being enveloped within the yellow *qi*, while the two *qi* beyond veil and reflect it, naturally creating a deep, shadowy hue.

**Azure Dragon:**
Visualize the azure *qi* within the liver emerging from the eyes, transformed through exhalation into an Azure Dragon, attending on the left. The eyes are the liver’s emissaries.

**White Tiger:**
Visualize the white *qi* within the lungs emerging from the nose, transformed through swallowing into a White Tiger, attending on the right. The nose is the lungs’ correspondence.

**Vermilion Bird:**
Visualize the red *qi* within the heart emerging from the mouth, transformed through exhaling into a Vermilion Bird, leading ahead. The tongue is the heart’s palace.

**Dark Warrior:**
Visualize the black *qi* within the kidneys emerging from the ears, transformed through blowing into a Dark Warrior, standing behind. The ears govern the kidneys; the left emits a tortoise, the right a serpent.

**Lion:**
From below the spleen, five-colored lions emerge through exhalation, seated beneath. One method has the gallbladder emitting six lions; another states twelve lions arrayed to left and right.

**White Cranes:**
Nine white cranes emerge from the stomach through the crown, crying out above, arrayed to left and right, before and behind, above and below.

**Oral Instructions:**
The spirits of the four directions and above and below are all present—this is called the Sixfold Regalia.

**Left and Right:**
The method states: the sun on the left and the moon on the right emerge from behind the brows at the two *Taiyang* points, the repository of the Six-in-One. When the sun and moon shine brightly, visualize the sun emerging from the left *Taiyang* into the left eye, its purple-red *qi* radiating nine rays. Visualize the moon emerging from the right *Taiyin* into the right eye, its yellow-white *qi* radiating ten rays. These are one’s own sun and moon. The chamber is illuminated, and a circular image arises from the nape, its light suffusing the ten directions. Visualize the sun and moon each nine inches from the face, their radiance filling the chamber, their luminous rays pouring into the nose and mouth, entering the Jade Pillow Palace behind the brain. A nine-colored circular image emerges from the nape, like a rainbow’s arc, its light penetrating the ten directions. All must be visualized with utmost clarity: the Three *Qi*, the Four Numinous Beasts, the lions, the white cranes, and the sun-and-moon’s circular images, each distinct and vivid.

Another method places the sun in front and the moon behind. When reciting scriptures facing east, the great brightness arises in the east, and the moon arises in the west—these are the sun and moon of heaven.

**Visualization Diagram (Oral Instructions for Visualization):**
The Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior are the Four Spirits. The lion, an earthly beast beneath me, is that which I ride; it is of the same class as the earthly horse. The white crane, a flying bird above me, is that which covers me; it is of the same class as the dragon and is a transcendent being. When the spirits of the four directions and above and below are all present, this is called the Sixfold Regalia. Only then does the form of the sun and moon become visible, illuminating the chamber within. Thus, the two images of water and fire appear, the Five *Qi* are complete, and the Three *Qi* are connected. This is the primordial image of heaven and earth as first generated by the Numinous Treasure.

**Chapter on Secret Incantations:**
The Mystic Master said: There are incantations of the heart, where the mind visualizes and the will invokes. There are whispered incantations, audible only to oneself. And there are secret incantations, spoken only in the heart, the mouth moving without sound.

**Secret Incantation:**
What is called "secret" is when the mouth recites and the heart perceives, the spirit and intent penetrating the unseen, so that outsiders cannot discern the sound.

**Summoning the Celestial Bureau Incantation:**
Left hand, Jade Clarity script; right hand, Highest Clarity script.
Above the highest heaven, Jade Clarity presides. The Mystic Mainstay, Great Chief, and Supreme Mystery Life Repository hold within them the Imperial Lord and the Numinous Void Queen Mother.

The method states: All Numinous Treasure Cavern-Mystery immortal officials belong to the inner forbidden Numinous Void Palace of the Queen Mother of the Western Primordial. Jade scripts and golden talismans govern the immortal prohibitions. Golden Lads and Jade Maidens examine and discern demons, commanding and restraining the Earl of Destiny.

The method states: The Earl of Destiny is the name of a spirit within the human life gate. This spirit is solely responsible for ascending and descending the Three Palaces, transmitting the merits and transgressions of the human body. It reports upward to the Three Heavens, forming the Bureau of Merit, conveying decrees, dispelling calamities, and rescuing from suffering. It guards and protects the Dao, imprisons and binds demonic harassers, roams the myriad heavens, delivers the living and transcends the dead, resolves misfortunes and crushes anomalies, communicates with the Purple Palace, and announces the commands of the Ten Heavens. Summon its presiding spirit swiftly, as commanded by the Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure and the Primordial Lord of the Beginning.

Recite the secret incantation once, spread the *qi* of the ten directions, and knock the teeth nine times. Next, visualize the Supreme Mystery Highest Lord of the Dao in the void, attended by true numina in solemn array.

**Incense-Burning Incantation:**
Supreme Mystery Primordial Highest Lord of the Dao,
Highest Clarity script.
Supreme Mystery Golden Portal Posterior Sage Primordial Highest Lord of the Dao.

The Mystic Master said: When petitioning the Highest Clarity, invoke the Five Numinous Mystic Venerable Lord and summon the spirits of one’s body. When petitioning the Highest Clarity, invoke the True Primordial Teaching Master Highest Venerable Lord. When petitioning the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, invoke the Highest Lord of the Dao.

Summon
your servant [Name]’s
Three-and-Five Merit Bureaus,
Jade Clarity script.
Three Heavens Merit Bureaus, Three Heavens Natural Renewal Merit Bureaus, Transmitting Words Merit Bureaus, Flying Incense Merit Bureaus, Memorializing Merit Bureaus, Mystic Wondrous Merit Bureaus, Five Thearchs Merit Bureaus, Five Thearchs Natural Renewal Merit Bureaus, Transmitting Words Merit Bureaus, Flying Incense Merit Bureaus, Memorializing Merit Bureaus, Mystic Wondrous Merit Bureaus.

The Mystic Master said: The Three-and-Five Merit Bureaus have two aspects of spirit transformation, each governing a numinous bureau. There are spirits of the Three Origins and Five Powers, which belong to the Highest Clarity Cavern-Spirit’s jurisdiction. These Three Heavens and Five Thearchs Merit Bureaus are not of the kind born from the womb or possessing form; they are all transformations of the Three-and-Five’s natural true *qi*. This is the celestial true *qi* of the Dao, which records the upright *qi* of the Three Fields and Five Viscera within the body to form numinous spirits. The Merit Bureaus have their assigned bureaus, hence they are called Merit Bureaus. The Merit Bureaus wear black silk caps with curved feet, red robes, and sashes, wielding swords and holding ledgers.

Left and Right Official Envoys,
*Mao* script, *You* script, Jade Clarity script.
Spirits of yin-yang communication, who precede the Five Officials’ intentions. The envoys wear black silk caps with curved feet, red ceremonial robes, black garments, and sashes, bearing talismans and holding staffs.

Incense-Bearing Golden Lad,
Jade Clarity script.
The *qi* of yang’s initial purity.

Transmitting Words Jade Maiden,
Jade Clarity script.
The spirit of yin’s fundamental purity.

Transmitting words, attending to incense, conveying sincerity—all are primordial true spirits of the fourth rank. The Golden Lads and Jade Maidens have jade-like faces and gem-like countenances, cloud-like hairpins, blue robes with wide sleeves, and immortal sashes with skirts and shoes.

Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans,
Jade Clarity script.
Eastern Green Thearch’s Direct Talisman, Southern Red Thearch’s Direct Talisman, Western White Thearch’s Direct Talisman, Northern Black Thearch’s Direct Talisman, Central Yellow Thearch’s Direct Talisman, each with thirty-two attendants. These are also talismans of the Five Directions’ true *qi*, transformations of the *qi* harmonized with virtue and the Dao. The Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans have two aspects: one benign, one stern. They wear curved-foot black silk caps, brocade robes, sashes, green boots, and carry swords and tablets, each dressed in the color of their direction.

Direct-Day Incense Officials,
Jade Clarity script.
They are the descendants of the Three Sovereigns, serving on the sixty *jiazi* days.

On each day, thirty-two attendants are present to direct the fragrant *qi*, dispel impurities, and summon the true. They are the manifestations of the *qi* of the sixty *jiazi* days from the original births of men and women. The Direct-Day Incense Officials resemble the Left and Right Official Envoys in form. Each group consists of thirty-two persons. From the Jade Clarity script, they move to the scripts of *chou*, *yin*, *mao*, *chen*, and *si*, then return to the Jade script, releasing it before the altar.

The Mysterious Master states: Among the myriad spirits, they are not limited to thirty-two persons. However, when summoning and reporting, only the celestial numbers of the four directions are used. The thirty-two persons comprise: for each day, one Celestial Clerk of the Three and Five, one Left Official Envoy, one Right Official Envoy, one Golden Youth of Incense Transmission, one Jade Maiden of Message Conveyance, one Direct Talisman of the Five Thearchs, and one Direct-Day Incense Official. Each day thus accounts for twelve persons, and across thirty-two days, they total three hundred eighty-four. Among them, only the Celestial Clerks are two in number, representing the Three Heavens and Five Thearchs. The Celestial Clerks correspond above to the twelve hundred Official Lords and below to the thirty-six thousand spirits and *qi*. Another tradition holds that all are spirits within the body, except for the Direct-Day Incense Officials, of whom there is one for each of the thirty-two heavens, descending to oversee and ascending to report.

Matters to be communicated or requested—what one wishes to express—should be concise and earnest, silently presented. Today is an auspicious day, one of the Three Origins, Eight Festivals, Five La Days, Ten Direct Days, or Three Assemblies. If it coincides with a Heavenly Amnesty *jiazi* or *gengshen* day, or aligns with a festival, Origin, or La day, it is called a propitious day. In a prolonged fast within a purified hall, the Mysterious Master notes: Unless it is the long fast of the first, seventh, or tenth month, one should not speak of a "long fast," but simply state, "Today, on this auspicious day, I fast and purify the hall."

When engaging in advanced scriptural practice, if one knows the covenant of the Three Caverns, one may speak of "practicing the advanced scriptures"; otherwise, such language is not used. For the deliverance of boundless beings, if referring to the ten directions of the netherworld, one may say "deliverance of boundless beings"; otherwise, one should state, "I recite scriptures for such-and-such a matter."

As for the petitioner, if it is oneself, one refers to one’s own case. Those who have received the register of methods address themselves by their ritual rank; those who have not received it call themselves "devoted Daoist disciple, your servant so-and-so." On this auspicious day, having fasted and purified the hall, I recite scriptures for such-and-such a matter. If acting on behalf of another, one states, "Your servant so-and-so recites scriptures for so-and-so’s such-and-such matter," and presents the purpose of the recitation.

For the turning of scriptures and the reception of life, "turning scriptures" signifies the tenfold circulation of numinous efficacy. May what is hereby presented ascend directly to the august presence of the Most High Primordial Thearch of the Thirty-Two Heavens. Release the mudra.

Xue Youqi’s annotation: The Primordial Thearch is not the same as the Most High Lord of Primordial Beginning. The Thearch, though supremely exalted, holds a rank equal to the Primordial Beginning, hence the title is fitting. Thus, the name "Primordial Beginning" is not exclusive to one honorific.

After kindling the incense burner, next visualize the *qi* of the thirty-two heavens as radiant jade mist, pouring into the crown of the head. The secret incantation reads:

*Tanluo yuluo, wuxu liutuo.
Taichong taiji, yinyang baohe.
Chu you ru wu, guishen moce.
Chu si ru sheng, bianhua ziran.
Yuanshi hunqi, xuanzhong zhi xuan.
Shang gan you ding, xia dong taiyuan.*

Recite once, and deep-seated ailments heal of themselves. Refine the hun and nurture the po, and true yang is preserved whole. Through fasting, ritual, and recitation, ten thousand repetitions lead to transcendence. This most secret incantation binds the myriad spirits. Recite the heart incantation again:

*Tanluo dong meng, yu Dao he zhen.
Yuqing shangji, fanqi yinyun.
Fenling buqi, jiangzhu chenshen.
Xingshen ju miao, bianhua feisheng.
Yiru lingge, tongshe wanling.
Jiji ru Yuanshi Shangdi lüling.*

Draw in the *qi* thirty-two times.

**Visualization and Oral Instructions:**
Gather the *qi* of the thirty-two heavens into one’s body, envisioning oneself as the Primordial Beginning, then begin the scripture recitation to undertake the affairs of the Primordial Beginning. Follow the previous method, starting with the Heaven of August Sovereigns, sequentially drawing in the *qi* by color through inhalation and swallowing.

**Eastern Eight Heavens:**
The *qi* of yellow, green, cyan, red, dark green, black, azure, and purple enters the liver, gallbladder, sinews, and vessels. Its essence transforms into the Venerable Lad of No-Flower, clad in purple and crowned with a lotus, residing within the liver.

**Southern Eight Heavens:**
The *qi* of white, yellow, green, cyan, red, dark green, black, and azure enters the pericardium and blood vessels. Its essence transforms into the Lord of Life’s Destiny, crowned in the manner of the Primordial Beginning, residing within the heart.

**Western Eight Heavens:**
The *qi* of purple, white, yellow, green, cyan, red, and dark green enters the lungs and skin. Its essence transforms into the White Prime Honored Spirit, clad in white and crowned with a lotus, residing within the lungs.

**Northern Eight Heavens:**
The *qi* of azure, purple, white, yellow, green, cyan, and red enters the kidneys and bones. Its essence transforms into the Peach Lad, clad in purple and crowned with a lotus, residing within the kidneys.

The Mysterious Master states: The true *qi* of the Numinous Treasure is the orthodox Dao *qi* of the thirty-two heavens. Without absorbing this *qi*, internal cultivation lacks a foundation for accomplishment, and external practice yields no responsive verification. Those who merely perform rituals as empty corpses or recite scriptures as ghosts below labor in vain.

First, knock the teeth nine times. From the Gate of Heaven, enter the Primordial Net’s flowing evolution diagram, proceeding to the lodging station. Visualize the *qi* of each heaven’s original color, filling the mouth. For the Eastern Eight Heavens, pace the stars of Dipper, Ox, Girl, Void, Rooftop, House, and Wall. For the Southern Eight Heavens, pace the stars of Horn, Neck, Root, Chamber, Heart, Tail, and Winnowing Basket. For the Western Eight Heavens, pace the stars of Well, Ghost, Willow, Star, Spread, Wings, and Chariot. For the Northern Eight Heavens, pace the stars of Straddler, Harvester, Stomach, Pleiades, Net, Purple, and Three Stars.

At the four cardinal directions, the Brahma Heavens do not belong to the central lodging stations of the Dipper’s *qi*-path; according to their colors, absorb the *qi* of each heaven and stand awaiting responsive communion. The detailed methods are recorded in the great canon; here, only an outline is presented.

Face east to recite the scripture.
The structure of recitation is as follows:
For the first round, begin with the Preface before the Lord of the Dao, where it is said, *"Formerly, in the Azure Heaven of Origins, recitation commenced..."*—proceed to this point in visualization, then recite the subsequent scriptural chapter.
For the second round, begin directly from *"The Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure Fundamental Chapter"* and continue reciting. With each visualization, complete ten full rounds. Upon reaching the tenth round, return to recite the Preface once more, then resume the prayerful contemplation.

Reciting this scripture in ten complete rounds adheres to the principle of *"ten revolutions to deliver humanity."*
From *"Formerly, in the Azure Heaven of Origins..."* to *"face east to recite the scripture"* constitutes the Preface before the Most High Lord of the Dao of Jade Dawn.

Here ends the first scroll of *The Supreme Scripture of the Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure: The Unbounded Deliverance of Humanity, Upper Grade Canon and Methods*.
Scroll Two of *The Scripture and Methods of the Primordial Beginning’s Unbounded Deliverance of Humanity, Upper Grade*.

**The Supreme Scripture of the Primordial Beginning’s Unbounded Deliverance of Humanity, Upper Grade: Annotated by Disciple Chen Chunrong of the Register of the Three-Five Capital Meritorious Offices**

The August Person says: This is the title designated by the Lord of the Dao.

The preceding title, *"The Supreme Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure,"* is the preface to the scripture composed by the Lord of the Dao of Jade Dawn, hence beginning with *"Dao"* as its marker. This title, *"The Primordial Beginning’s Unbounded Deliverance of Humanity,"* is spoken by the Heavenly Worthy Himself, taking *"Primordial Beginning"* as its heading. All before *"Naturally"* is the Lord of the Dao’s brief preface, while from *"Chaotic Abyss"* onward is the Heavenly Worthy’s original chapter.

**The Cavernous Mystery Chapter**
*"The Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure: Original Chapter"*—this is the title designated by the August Person within the heading.

**The Wondrous Beginning of the Upper Grade**
The Mystic Master says: *"Primordial"* is the ancestor of the myriad Dao; *"Beginning"* is the origin of the host of qi; *"Cavernous"* is the numinous response of divine resonance; *"Mystery"* is the unfathomable transformation of luminous scenes; *"Numinous"* is the certain fulfillment of all prayers; *"Treasure"* is the sacred root of immortals and perfected beings. These six characters, as the ancestor of the myriad Dao and the origin of the host of qi, converge within the Great Cavern to become the wondrous beginning of the upper grade.

**Ten Revolutions to Deliver Humanity**
This is the Heavenly Worthy’s method of reciting the scripture ten times, revolving the numinous through ten transformations.

**The Hidden Rhymes of the Hundred Demons, Separating and Merging Naturally**
These four lines, as stated by the August Person, summarize the essential purport of the entire scripture. The twenty-four characters form the opening of the Cavernous Mystery’s original chapter.

The Mystic Master says: The purport of this chapter lies in the hidden rhymes of the hundred demons, which separate and merge naturally. The *"hundred demons"* refer to the kings of the Great Demon Lords of the Nine Empyreans, who, together with the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, transform into the primordial qi of Jade Purity, the imperial descendants of the August Lineage. They are:
- The Jade Purity King of Divine Empyrean,
- The Jade Purity King of Purple Empyrean, Vanquisher of Demons,
- The Preserver of Scenery, King of the Crimson Horizon’s Central Pole,
- The Jade Purity King of Azure Empyrean, Illuminator of Cavernous Clarity,
- The Wondrous Transformer, King of Jade Empyrean,
followed by the Jade Purity Kings of Grand Empyrean, Azure Empyrean, Scenic Empyrean, and Resonant Empyrean—all emperors of the great demons.
Next are the Great Demons of the Nine Heavens, the Three Heavens, the Three Realms, the Three Clarities, the Five Thearchs, the various heavens, and the demons of the Brahmā Heaven’s Numinous Lords. Then come the demons of the Three Ministries of Heavenly Assistants and the Great Mystery, along with the demons of comparison, negation, numinosity, restraint, and divinity—culminating in the hidden rhymes of the Great Demons of the Six Heavens. All are recorded within the second chapter, composing verses through the separation and merging of the wondrous sounds of the hundred demons.

**The Crimson Writings**
*The Crimson Writings of the Numinous Chaos of the Wondrous Transformation of the Supreme Ultimate*

The Primordial Beginning inaugurates the kalpa,
The Supreme Mystery initiates the numinous.
Vacuous and boundless, without form,
A single qi flows into shape.
Transforming to give birth to the two luminaries,
The five wefts congeal into essence.
Naturally merging and harmonizing,
The fetters of the embryo are forever dissolved.
The assembly of perfected beings deploys its radiance,
Resplendent throughout the Nine Clarities.
The Flaming Pool expands in brilliance,
The seven epochs align in unison.
Pray to Master Lu Hao,
As the Cinnabar Heaven gleams crystalline.
Crimson light refines and delivers,
Vermilion mists scatter their clarity.
The three flowers flourish in splendor,
Illuminating the dawn of the Thearch.

*"The Crimson Writings of the Numinous Chaos of the Wondrous Transformation of the Supreme Ultimate"*—this encompasses the transformation of the nine yangs to illuminate the celestial deliverance, forming the realms of the Nine Empyreans and Nine Heavens. Thus:
- The Divine Empyrean of Jade Purity, Heaven of the Vacuous August, arises from the qi of the nine yangs of the numinous, radiant, and pure void of Brahmā.
- The Heaven of the Jade Script of the Southern Culmen of Cinnabar Empyrean arises from the qi of the cinnabar numen, wondrous radiance, and cavernous yang of the true primordial Brahmā.
- The Heaven of the True Culmen of the Great Void of Azure Empyrean arises from the qi of the vast numen, great radiance, and primordial true unity of the upper yang.
- The Heaven of the Pure Radiance of Jade of Jade Empyrean arises from the qi of the jade numen, pure radiance, and perfect yang of the true primordial unity.
- The Heaven of the True Primordiality of the Grand Empyrean arises from the qi of the grand numen, cavernous radiance, three yangs, nine perfected beings, and Grand Unity.
- The Heaven of the Luminous Primordiality of Resonant Empyrean arises from the qi of the pure numen, luminous radiance, six yangs, and cavernous true unity.
- The Heaven of the Upper Culmen of Primordial Numinosity of Purple Empyrean arises from the qi of the primordial numen, purple radiance, pure yang, and wondrous true unity of Heaven.
- The Heaven of the Wondrous Numinosity of Scenic Radiance of Scenic Empyrean arises from the qi of the wondrous numen, radiant radiance, and true void of the yang essence.
- The Heaven of the Jade Radiance of the Boundless of Azure Empyrean arises from the qi of the azure numen, jade radiance, and primordial true unity of the yang of Heaven.

These Nine Empyreans and Nine Heavens are all celestial realms transformed from the Crimson Writings of the Chaotic Abyss.

**The Crimson Writings of the Chaotic Abyss**—both hands gather the Jade Purity script.
The True One Beyond the Utterly Non-Existent.

*"Chaos"* is the name of the primordial undifferentiation; *"Abyss"* is the qi of the cavernous yang. These five characters originated before the Great Brahmā. By the Crimson Clarity kalpa, the Primordial Beginning employed the fire of the cavernous yang to refine and forge them. *"Crimson Writings"* refers to the crimson script of the jade characters, which, at the dawn of primordial chaos and before the existence of heaven and earth, congealed above the empty void and coagulated within the Supreme Primordiality. The *"primordial"* of the Supreme Primordiality is also the primordial of the primordial; having primally originated the primordial, it is thus called *"the True One Beyond the Utterly Non-Existent."*

**The Primordial Beginning’s Ancestral Kalpa, Giving Birth to the Myriad Heavens**
*"Ancestral"* means *"beginning."* The Mysterious Primordial flourished in the initial kalpa, suddenly giving birth to the five hundred million heavens. The *"initial kalpa"* refers to the world’s inception before any formation or dissolution.

The *Inner Image of the Cinnabar Purport* states: *"Primordial Beginning"* is the primordial qi of the precelestial void and spontaneity. In humans, it is called the indestructible primordial spirit of one’s former kalpas. The revelation of the three luminaries is the root of heaven. The division of the Two Modes and the illumination of the Three Radiances all receive the qi of the beginning, hence it is the root of heaven.

The *Inner Image of the Cinnabar Purport Scripture* says: The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three gives birth to the myriad things. Thus, the *Scripture of the Spontaneous Arising of the Vacuous and Natural* states: The Dao achieves completion through the Three. Therefore, it is said that the Three unite to form virtue; without the full Three, no affair can be accomplished.

The *Striking Rhymes* says: The *Book of Changes* has the Supreme Ultimate, which gives birth to the Two Modes.

Indeed, from the One Radiance the clear and turbid divide—this is the Three. The *Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Chapters on Generating the Divine* states: The Three Qi conjoin to generate the Nine Qi; the Three Qi are the honor of heaven and earth, while the Nine Qi are the root of the myriad things. The Three, through multiplication, become Nine, the root of the myriad things—thus it is said that the Three give birth to the myriad things. The Three unite to form virtue: in the Dao, they are the Three Qi; in things, they are the Three Powers; in heaven, they are the Three Luminaries; in man, they are the Three Origins. All are the primordial ancestral qi of the Originating Beginning, the fundamental root of the myriad things. Hence, the revelation of the Three Luminaries is the root of heaven.

Speaking inwardly, if one borrows the metaphor of alchemical imagery, they are called lead, mercury, and cinnabar. Pointing directly to the thing itself, they are the inherent nature, the wondrous transformations of daily use, and the dual qi of yin and yang. Though one may know this inherent nature to be luminous and wondrous, one does not know that this inherent nature continues its seed in the Kun Palace between the two kidneys—this is the primordial, vacuous, and spontaneous pure essence of the True One, from which the wondrous transformations of yin and yang arise. This is detailed in the *Red Writ of the Primal Kalpa of the Chaotic Epoch* in the *Purport of the Cinnabar Scripture*.

Within heaven and earth, all things first possess a root and only afterward a stem. As with fruit that has a pit—this is its root; when the pit is sown in soil, yin and yang interact and press upon it, causing it to split and sprout, thus generating roots. Only then can it grow luxuriantly, flourish, and bear fruit, perpetuating life without end. If there were no rootstock and one desired the root to endure, such a thing has never existed. Therefore, the Heavenly Worthy first pointed to the ancestral qi as the root of the Dao, then clarified the Three Luminaries as the stem of the Dao.

The Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure possess the Dao of the Revelation of the Three Luminaries. At the time of sunrise, with a calm heart, face the sun and recite the *Incantation of Yu Yi*:

*"Sun-soul, Vermilion Radiance, Illuminating the Green Bloom, Returning Rosy Clouds, Crimson Youth, Mysterious Blazing Whirlwind-Image."*

Draw in the sun’s purple qi, swallowing eighty-one times. At the time of moonrise, face the moon and recite the *Incantation of Jie Lin*:

*"Moon-spirit, Luminous Mist, Fragrant Splendor, Veiled Loneliness, Graceful Emptiness, Orchid’s Profound Bloom, Jade Petals, Pure Gold, Limpid Radiance, Resplendent Countenance, Towering Standard."*

Draw in the moon’s yellow qi, swallowing one hundred twenty times. At the end of the *xu* hour of the night, gaze upward at the Northern Dipper and recite the inner names of the Northern Dipper: □, □, □, □, □, □, □. Inhale the golden light of the Seven Stars, swallowing forty-nine times. By ingesting this true qi of the Three Luminaries, one returns essence and restores the embryo. After three years of practice, one receives the scripture and is named a True Person of the Three Luminaries.

There is also the Dao of the Inner Audience of the Three Luminaries and the Flying Immortal’s Division of Form. During the *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei* hours, one pays audience to the Controller of Destiny in the Central Origin within the heart, whose name is *Xuan Jian*, the Supreme Unity Lord of the Central Ultimate. He governs the nourishment of one’s entire bodily form and resides below in the spleen. The spleen is the Jade Hall, also called the Jade Chamber. One clicks the teeth five times, visualizing the yellow qi in the spleen, within which there is a true person, like a newborn infant, clad in yellow robes and cap. One recites:

*"Central Ultimate, Xuan Jian, Supreme Unity True Lord. I, so-and-so, desire the Dao of the True Person, the Divine Immortal, and the Yellow Court."*

During the *yin*, *mao*, *wu*, and *shen* hours, one pays audience to the Supreme Unity Divine Lord of the Upper Origin, known as the Venerable Elder of the Southern Ultimate. He governs one’s hun-soul, po-soul, womb spirit, life qi, and the father of the embryo palace. One clicks the teeth nine times, visualizing one inch directly above the head—the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, also called the Palace of the Supreme Unity—filled with red and yellow qi, within which there is a true person like a child, clad in crimson robes. One recites:

*"Venerable Elder of the Southern Ultimate, Supreme Unity True Lord. I, so-and-so, desire the Dao of the divine elixir and eternal life."*

During the *zi*, *you*, *si*, and *hai* hours, one pays audience to the Mysterious Dao Mother of the Northern Ultimate of the Lower Origin, whose name is *Xuan Miao*. She resides below in the Double Union Palace. The kidneys are the Double Union Palace, governing the life and death of one’s essence and qi, and the mother of the talismanic register. One clicks the teeth four times, visualizing white qi in the buttocks, within which there is a divine turtle. Upon the turtle sits a Mysterious Woman, the Numinous Consort, seated upon the turtle. She wears blue and white robes, like a newborn girl. To her right is the Controller of Records, and to her left is the Controller of Destiny. One recites:

*"Mysterious Dao Mother of the Northern Ultimate of the Lower Origin, named Xuan Miao. I, so-and-so, desire to attain a golden body and jade spring for sustenance. I beseech you to command the Controllers of Destiny and Records to erase my name from the register of death and inscribe it anew for eternal life."*

With prolonged practice and unwavering mindfulness, this becomes the practice of the Three August Emperor Lords of the Cavernous Mystery. It is indeed the esoteric mechanism of the Numinous Treasure, undertaken only after forming a covenant with heaven and informing one’s master.

Above, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao is one’s body. One receives the primordial and wondrous qi of spontaneity, thereby transforming into the dharmakāya of human Dao. The Dao takes vacuity and non-being as its essence, spontaneity as its root, and the Dao as its body—there is no further ancestor.

The Five Scripts unfold and expand. The August Person says: The Five Scripts are the inner sounds of the vermilion characters of the Five Elders of the Five Directions. They universally propagate the divine spirits. Without script, there is no illumination; without script, there is no clarity; without script, there is no establishment; without script, there is no completion; without script, there is no deliverance; without script, there is no generation. This is the *Jade Clarity Scripture’s Method of Releasing the Scripts*. The Five Chapters of True Script unfold their forms, universally generating heaven and earth and establishing the divine spirits. Without true script, the sun and moon would not shine, the stars would not gleam, the cosmos would not stand, the world would not be completed, the hidden souls would not be delivered, and the withered bones would not live.

The *Great Brahmā Chapter* is the Great Brahmā, the heaven within heaven. The *Scripture of the Dragon’s Ascent* says: The Three Clarities Heaven comprises the Four Brahmā Heavens and above, governed by the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate. The Twelve Heavens of the Grand Clarity are the abode of the Nine Immortals and the capital of the Nine Elders, governed by the Golden Gates and the Later Sage. Next are the Twelve Heavens of the Highest Clarity, the abode of the Nine Perfected, governed by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord. Above them are the Twelve Heavens of the Great Ultimate and Jade Clarity, the abode of the Nine Sages, governed by the Originating Beginning Heavenly Worthy. This is the heaven within heaven—the Thirty-Six Heavens.

The Yulu Xiaotai, the Xiaotai being the Mystic Terrace of Seven Treasures, has nine tiers that reflect upon the Great Luo above. The Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital: the Supreme Mystery Capital of the Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital is governed by the Patriarch, the Heavenly Worthy of Originating Beginning.

Utmost and without superior, the Great Luo and Jade Clarity—the Capital of Great Luo and Jade Clarity—is where the Jade Clarity’s Patriarch, the Heavenly Worthy of Originating Beginning, feasts upon the Three Radiances and establishes the root of the Dao.

The Great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure reveals the Dao of the Three Radiant Openings. At sunrise, with a calm heart, face the sun and recite the *Yu Yi Incantation*: "Sun’s soul, vermilion radiance, luminous green blossoms, returning rosy clouds, dark lad, mysterious flames, whirlwind’s image." Draw in the sun’s purple qi with eighty-one inhalations. At moonrise, face the moon and recite the *Jie Lin Incantation*: "Moon’s spirit, beloved mist, fragrant beauty, veiled desolation, graceful emptiness, orchid’s luxuriance, jade’s purity, golden clarity, radiant countenance, terrace’s splendor." Draw in the moon’s yellow qi with one hundred twenty inhalations. At the end of the hour of Xu at night, gaze upon the Northern Dipper, recite the Dipper’s inner names □, □□, □, □, □, □, and absorb the golden light of the Seven Stars with forty-nine inhalations. By ingesting these Three Radiant True Qi, one returns essence and restores the embryo. After three years of accomplishment, one receives the scriptures and becomes a True Person of the Three Radiances.

There is also the Dao of the Inner Audience’s Three Radiant Flying Immortals, who divide their forms. At the hours of Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei, one faces the Central Origin’s Heart Controller of Life, whose name is Mysterious Firmness, the Supreme Ultimate Grand Unity Lord. He governs the nurturing of the adept’s entire bodily form and resides in the spleen. The spleen is the Jade Hall, also called the Jade Chamber. Knock the teeth five times, visualize the yellow qi in the spleen, and behold a true person within, like a newborn infant dressed in yellow. Recite: "Central Ultimate, Mysterious Firmness, Grand Unity True Lord. I, so-and-so, seek the Dao of the True Person, the Divine Immortal, and the Yellow Court." At the hours of Yin, Mao, Wu, and Shen, one faces the Upper Origin’s Grand Unity Divine Lord, titled the Southern Culmen Elder. He governs the adept’s ethereal and corporeal souls, the womb spirit, the life qi, and the father of the embryo’s palace. Knock the teeth nine times, visualize one inch directly above the head—the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, also called the Palace of the Grand Unity—filled with red and yellow qi, and behold a true person within, childlike and clad in crimson. Recite: "Southern Culmen, Primordial Elder, Grand Unity True Lord. I, so-and-so, seek the Dao of the divine elixir and immortality." At the hours of Zi, You, Si, and Hai, one faces the Lower Origin’s Northern Culmen Mysterious Dao Mother, whose name is Mysterious Wonder, residing in the Double Union Palace. The kidneys are the Double Union Palace, governing the adept’s essence and qi, life and death, and the mother of the tally registers. Knock the teeth four times, visualize white qi in the buttocks, within which is a divine turtle, and upon the turtle sits the Mysterious Maiden, the numinous consort. She wears blue and white, like a newborn girl, with the Controller of Records to her right and the Controller of Life to her left. Recite: "Lower Origin’s Primordial Spirit, Northern Culmen Mysterious Dao Mother, named Mysterious Wonder. I, so-and-so, seek the golden body and jade spring to drink and eat. I entreat the Controllers of Life and Records to erase my name from the register of death and inscribe me for long life." With prolonged practice and unwavering mindfulness, this is the esoteric mechanism of the Numinous Treasure, as performed by the Three Sovereign Lords of the Cavernous Mystery. It is also carried out under the covenant of heaven and the oath to one’s master.

Above, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is one’s body. One receives the primal and wondrous qi’s spontaneity, thereby transforming into the dharmakāya of human Dao. The Dao takes emptiness and nothingness as its essence, spontaneity as its root, and the Dao as its body—there is no prior ancestor.

The Five Scripts unfold and expand. The August Person says: The Five Scripts are the inner sounds of the Five Directions’ Five Elders’ vermilion-written jade characters. They universally cultivate the divine and numinous. Without script, there is no illumination; without script, there is no clarity; without script, there is no establishment; without script, there is no completion; without script, there is no deliverance; without script, there is no life. The Jade Clarity’s Scriptural Release Formula: the Five Chapters of True Script unfold forms and universally generate heaven and earth, settling the divine and numinous. Without true script, the sun and moon would not shine, the stars would not gleam, qian and kun would not be established, the world would not be formed, the hidden souls would not be delivered, and the withered bones would not live.

The *Great Brahmā Chapter* is the Great Brahmā, the heaven within heaven. The *Scripture of the Dragon’s Ascent* says: The Three Clarities Heaven comprises the Four Brahmā Heavens and above, governed by the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate. The Twelve Heavens of the Grand Clarity are the abode of the Nine Immortals and the capital of the Nine Elders, governed by the Golden Gates and the Later Sage. Next are the Twelve Heavens of the Highest Clarity, the abode of the Nine Perfected, governed by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord. Above them are the Twelve Heavens of the Great Ultimate and Jade Clarity, the abode of the Nine Sages, governed by the Heavenly Worthy of Originating Beginning. This is the heaven within heaven—the Thirty-Six Heavens.

The Yulu Xiaotai, the Xiaotai being the Mystic Terrace of Seven Treasures, has nine tiers that reflect upon the Great Luo above. The Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital: the Supreme Mystery Capital of the Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital is governed by the Patriarch, the Heavenly Worthy of Originating Beginning. Utmost and without superior, the Great Luo and Jade Clarity—the Capital of Great Luo and Jade Clarity—is where the Jade Clarity’s Patriarch, the Heavenly Worthy of Originating Beginning, resides in the heaven of the Utmost and Supreme Great Luo. The Sagely Master, the Jade Emperor, governs the Grand Tenuity Jade Clarity Palace and oversees the myriad celestial beings.

Vast and immeasurable, as if absent, as if present, the Three Flowers depart and convene. Above the various heavens is the Hall of the Three Flowers’ Departure and Convening. The Three Flowers are the Jade Clarity’s Three Origin Palaces: the Upper Origin’s Jade Flower, the Middle Origin’s Golden Flower, and the Lower Origin’s Nine Flowers, all inhabited by the Three Origin Highest Sovereign Dao Lords. The Departure and Convening is the Jade Clarity’s detached palace and convenient hall. The Wondrous Court of the Great Existence: the Highest Clarity’s Wondrous Court Palace, where the Ancestral Master, the Jade Dawn Dao Lord, dwells in the formless world of the Highest Clarity’s Great Existence Heaven. The Golden Gates and Jade Chambers: the Ancestral Master, the Jade Dawn Dao Lord, governs the Golden Gates’ Liao Yang Palace; the True Master, the Most High Lord Lao, governs the Grand Clarity Palace. The Jade Chambers are the Highest Clarity’s Jade Chambers Palace.

The Luminous Array and Pure Abyss.
The Luminous Array’s Upper Mansion and the Pure Abyss’s Two Pools are the two ponds beneath the Jade Clarity’s Hall. The Mysterious Master states: speaking inwardly, these are the Nine Palaces of the Mud-Pill. This is precisely the Dao of the Primordial Beginning’s inner court. The Imperial Commentary says: these Nine Palaces are the names of the Jade Capital’s feminine and masculine Nine Palaces. In human terms, within the Mud-Pill’s Great Hua, Central Hua, and Lesser Hua Three Flowers—belonging to Wood—dwells the Jade Clarity’s Earth Mother. The Departure and Convening, belonging to Fire, is inhabited by the Highest Clarity’s Jade Consort. The Wondrous Court of the Great Existence, belonging to Earth, is inhabited by the Yellow Plain’s Purple Spirit Primordial Lord. The Wondrous Court, belonging to Water, is inhabited by the Grand Mystery’s Divine Woman. These four palaces are the feminine palaces, located in the north of the Jade Capital.

The Golden Gates Palace is inhabited by the Grand Plain’s Primordial Elder. The Jade Chambers Palace is inhabited by the Flourishing Yang Emperor Lord. The Luminous Array Palace is inhabited by the Flowing Pearl Perfected. The Pure Wondrous Palace is inhabited by the Grand One’s Primordial King. The Grand Numinous Palace is inhabited by the Upper Origin’s Crimson Child. These five palaces are the masculine palaces, located in the south of the Jade Capital.

The aforementioned Nine Palaces lie atop the Jade Capital Mountain, arrayed in ordered patterns like the human brain. When mapped onto the body, none fails to correspond—only humans, benighted and unaware, do not perceive it.

**Vast Radiance Chapter**

Form the Mudrā of Jade Clarity’s Script with both hands.
The Great Practice of Vast Blackness—
The Mystic Master says: The Great Practice of Vast Radiance is one’s own primordial radiance. Its details are elucidated in the diagram.

**Diagram of the Great Practice of Vast Blackness**
*Diagram of the Great Practice of Vast Blackness at Western Tortoise Mountain*

The Mystic Master says: The Ancestor of Vast Qi is the Queen Mother of the West. The Ninefold Numinous, Most Wondrous White Jade Tortoise-Terrace Jade-Light Golden Perfected Vast Qi Ancestral Mother Primordial Lord, and the Azure-Golden Elixir August Dao Lord Metal Mother, dwell upon Western Tortoise Mountain—also called Dragon Mountain. This is the root and pivot of the Nine Qi, the profound palace of true earth, situated at the northwest corner, between the *hai* and *zi* positions, bordering Jade Clarity and connecting to the Mud Pill Palace. To the south, it adjoins the Scarlet Palace of Penetrating Yang, linking above to the lung qi and below to the inner gate of the sun and moon. The Cinnabar Chamber and Golden Palace lie within the kidneys, three *cun* square, northward aligned with the inner kidneys, flanked by the Twelve Spirit Chambers. At its center resides the sovereign of Vast Qi, the Feminine One True Mother.

Vast Qi ascends in daily audience; if the mind harbors dust, the Great Practice is lost, and Vast Qi cannot suffuse the entire body, circulating through the ten directions. The *Inner Image Elixir Principles* states: This is the precelestial pure essence of True Unity’s qi, stored between the kidneys in the Palace of Earth. Wondrously transforming and arising, it ascends to the Palace of Heaven; when yang reaches its apex, yin is born, descending to return to the origin. Ascending and descending in ceaseless circulation, it flows without end—hence it is called "circulating through the ten directions." The circulation of Vast Qi is detailed in the *Diagram of the Flowing Evolution of the Primordial Net*.

Within it dwells the spirit who delivers people from death—
The spirit who delivers people from death is named Flying Life, governing the affairs of transcending the world and avoiding death.
*Imperial Commentary*: The spirit of immortality is a transformation of the Primordial Beginning. His taboo name is Father Tranquil Presence, his style conjoins Mother’s Essence.

Within it dwells the Lord of Southern Culmen and Longevity—
In the Southern Culmen Palace resides the Lord of Delivered Destiny, styled Exhale Complete, who governs the registers of longevity.
*Imperial Commentary*: This is the Great Emperor Lord of Longevity, also called the Southern Culmen Life-Registering Great Emperor.

Within it dwells the deliverer of the world—
The Lord of World-Deliverance, whose taboo name is Trustworthy Dao Awareness, styled Diligent Bright Heaven, presides over the passage through the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations.

The Marshal Great Spirit—
*Imperial Commentary*: The Marshal Great Spirit King who delivers people and saves the world, whose taboo name is Regulate Constant Life, styled Refined Dao Zhou, commands the Red Armor Divine Soldiers, the mighty deities who subdue the yin demons and ghostly essences of the Six Heavens.

Within it dwells the Venerable Lord Han of Cherished Life—
The Lord of Cherished Life, whose taboo name is Plan, is the most revered among spirits, called the Venerable One.
*Imperial Commentary*: The Lord of Cherished Life is the Lord of Bestowed Blessings and Compassionate Life in the Azure Florescence Palace, whose taboo name is Broad Follows Aspiration, styled Heavenly Compassion.

Within it dwell the Exalted Spirits of the Southern Upper Registers of Life and Records, who extend lifespan, augment destiny, and deliver from tribulation—
These are the spirits of the Southern Upper Cavern Yang Palace, the perfected ones of the Six Southern Dipper Offices. They restore bones to life and deliver countless people.

**Release of the Jade Clarity Mudrā**
These two lines summarize the preceding text: from "within it dwells the deliverer of people" to this point, all the offices of the perfected palaces possess the power to restore bones to life and deliver people to Dao attainment.
*Imperial Commentary*: In the Celestial Bureaus of the Nine Heavens resides the Lord of Restored Bones and Revived Life, whose taboo name is Party Worthy Origin, styled Elder Attendant Perfected. The Lord of Boundless Deliverance, whose taboo name is Principle Ascends Entwined, styled Sufficient August Brightness, presides over the offices of the Northern and Southern Culmens, the Purple Tenuity of the Grand Tenuity.

The Mystic Master says: All these spirits gather qi in the Nine Heavens; the Nine Heavens gather qi in the Grand Tenuity. The Vast Qi of the Grand Tenuity is the qi of the Highest Cavern Mystery, entering and transforming the body. The above main text was spoken by the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning.

**Summoning the Perfected Chapter**

Today is the day of collation and transcription, as the myriad heavens descend to the imperial throne.
"Today" refers to the first kalpa of the Crimson Clarity, the day of unfolding the charts and collating the records in the Great Floating Black Realm.

The Mystic Master declares: These Ten Directions’ Flying Heavenly Divine Kings possess majestic virtue, merit, and power of profound magnitude—sacred transformations beyond all reckoning. At the dawn of the Crimson Clarity Kalpa in the Floating Li Kingdom, on the day of unfolding charts and recording registers, by command of the Primordial Most High, they were entrusted to govern all registers of the Three Realms and Ten Directions. Proceeding to the Imperial Terrace of Xuanyuan, they weigh transgressions and blessings, inscribe merits and faults, and according to each direction’s rank and measure, deliver beings without limit. Whenever living beings are to be delivered or the dead rescued, flying celestial messengers and divine soldiers are dispatched to memorialize the Divine Kings, beseeching their salvific intervention.

The Ten Directions’ Perfected Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Boundless Great Spirits of Longevity and World-Deliverance, all ride upon soaring clouds, crimson chariots with verdant escorts, feathered canopies and jade wheels, drawn by vermilion phoenixes bearing *Wu* script and five-colored mystic dragons bearing *Chen* script. They bear nine-hued standards and ten sacred pennants of absolute efficacy. Ahead, nine phoenixes roar in unison, chanting *Mao* script—the vanguard belongs to yang, and yang’s number is odd, hence nine. Behind, eight simurghs sing in harmony—*Bagua* formula—the rearguard belongs to yin, and yin’s number is even, hence eight. Lions bearing *Yin* script and white cranes bearing *Xu* script; their harmonious songs resound in *You* script. The Five Elders open the path—*Jade Clarity* script—while hosts of immortals flank the axle—*Supreme Clarity* script ascending to *Highest Clarity* script. Myriad chariots and ten thousand riders arrive floating through the void.

The Five Elders are the Five Thearchs. The Ten Directions’ Great Sages, exalted in Dao-rank, evoke the Five Thearchs to lead the way, with throngs of immortals attending their procession, opening the road of the Way. The *Scripture of the Five Talismans’ Fundamental Practices* states: In the east, Anbao Hualin’s Azure Numinous First Elder, the Azure Thearch, surnamed Yan, named Kai, styled Weilingyang. In the south, Fanbao Changyang’s Cinnabar Numinous True Elder, the Vermilion Thearch, surnamed Dongfu, named Jiyan, styled Chipiaonu. In the center, Yubao Yuanling’s Primordial Elder, the Yellow Thearch, surnamed Tongban, named Yuanliang, styled Hanzhuniu. In the west, Qibao Jinmen’s Radiant Numinous August Elder, the White Thearch, surnamed Shangjin, named Changkai, styled Yaopoyu. In the north, Dongyin Shuodan’s Jade Treasure Five Numinous Mystic Elder, the Black Thearch, surnamed Heijie, named Linghui, styled Yinhouju. These Five Elder Thearchs are all celestial perfected spirits of spontaneous origin, hence called the Primordial Five Elders.

Their radiance pours forth in passage—*Kun* script—
*"Pouring radiance"* denotes streaming essence and jade light, mutually illuminating and resplendent.
*"Returning passage"* denotes flying cloud wheels revolving around the Dharma-throne.
They oversee the deliverance of the true and salvation of the living—*Yin* script.
The Ten Directions’ Supreme Sages assemble at the Thearch’s abode, supervising the multitudes of perfected and assessing the deliverance of all beings.

The Celestial Chancellors—press the middle finger to the base of the thumb.
The *chancellor-qi* and *ministerial qi* are those who establish the Lord of the Myriad Transformations. The Chancellor is the divine lord of the Great Luo Heaven. As guests of rebirth for the delivered, they assist in the affairs of all heavens.

The Southern Prosperity Upper Palace—*Wu* script.
The Han Director of Records—*Li* script.
The Han Lord’s Director supervises the Register of Longevity.

The Supervising Life Great Spirit—*Yin* script.
This is the Perfected Deliverer of Beings, styled *Fuyi*.
Holding the registers and grasping the ledgers, they assemble in unison before the Thearch.
According to those who ought to be delivered, they strictly assess all heavens.
End of the middle finger script.

The above is the main text, wherein the Jade Dawn Dao Lord expounds the decree of deliverance.

**Universal Proclamation Chapter**
Forty-eight characters proclaiming the edicts to the Three Realms—clasp both hands in the Jade Purity script.

Proclaiming to the Three Realms:
The Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm.
The Boundless Divine Homeland—the ten directions’ boundless worlds.
The Northern Capital of Fengdu—the Right Palace of the Lower Prime.

Fengdu lies in the *Gui* region north of heaven and earth, called the Fengdu Spring Bend Prefecture. Luofeng is the name of a mountain in the Northern Capital. As stated in the *Subduing Demons Sutra*: "In the due north of the lower realm lies a vast sea, foul and black, its bounds unfathomable. Within it stands a mountain, a hundred and six thousand leagues high, its summit piercing the azure vault, its base plunging into the windy springs, named the Northern Capital Luofeng Mountain. Near the water’s surface, there is a great cavern called the Palace of Yin Shadow Heaven. It spans thirty-six thousand leagues in circumference and contains thirty-seven prisons. The ruler of this cavern is named the Heavenly Lord of Great Yin. Beyond this cavern, on the mountain, lie six other caverns, each governed by one of the Six Great Demons of the Six Heavens—these are the Six Ministries beyond the Heavenly Lord of Great Yin. The lesser officials of the Six Ministries number thirty-six myriad. The first cavern is named the Palace of Zhou’s Severed Yin Heaven; the second, the Palace of Tai’s Slaughter and Solemn Affairs Clan Heaven; the third, the Palace of Bright Morn’s Endurance and Martial Completion Heaven; the fourth, the Palace of Tranquil Illumination and Sinful Qi Heaven; the fifth, the Palace of the Clan Spirit’s Seven Transgressions Heaven; the sixth, the Palace of Daring Governance and Linked Grievances Heaven. The scripture states: Those who hold these six palace names in reverence shall have the demon kings vouch for them, their names of death erased, and their lives spared from suffering, gaining boundless blessings." The above six palaces and the six palaces within the Heavenly Lord of Great Yin’s cavern are mutually accountable, overseeing the execution of punishments.

The *Zi* Ministry Bureau—appointed by matter, their numbers countless, beyond enumeration.

The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus:
The Three Offices of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Each office has three courts, hence the Nine Bureaus.

According to the *Scripture of the Three Primes’ Precepts and Prohibitions*:
The Upper Prime Heavenly Office is subordinate to the Jade Purity Realm, formed by the coalescence of the green, yellow, and white *qi*, establishing three palaces. The Central Palace is named the Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace of Primordial Yang. Within it are the left, right, and central courts: the Left Court governs the Office of Life, the Great Yang Fire Thearch Examiner; the Right Court governs the Office of Death, the Great Yin Water Thearch Examiner; the Central Court governs the Examiner of Life, Death, Sin, and Blessing, the Wind Blade.

The Left Palace is named the Supreme Mystery Left Palace of Primordial Yellow, also the Left Ministerial Palace of Jade Purity, and likewise has three courts. The Right Palace is named the Supreme Mystery Cavern White Right Palace of Primordial Yang, also the Palace of Pure Tenuity, and has three courts, their examinations identical to the Central Palace. The Upper Prime’s three palaces govern three courts each, and each court governs four ministries, totaling thirty-six ministries.

The Middle Prime Earthly Office is subordinate to the High Purity Realm, formed by the congealing of the *qi* of Primordial Cavern and Mixed Spirit, and the essence of Ultimate Yellow. Its Central Palace is named the Cavern Spirit Pure Emptiness Palace, containing left, right, and central courts: the Left Court is named the Endurance and Bright Morn Court; the Right Court, the Zhou’s Severed Yin Heaven Court; the Central Court, the Seven Transgressions and Tranquil Illumination Court. Their examinations of sin and blessing are no different from the Upper Prime.

The Left Palace is named the Southern Culmen Cavern Yang Palace, containing three courts: the Left Court is named the Solemn Affairs Court; the Right Court, the Clan Spirit Court; the Central Court, the Spirit’s Divine Likeness Court. The Right Palace is named the Fengdu Palace, also called the Yin Heaven Palace, containing three courts: the Left Court is named the Linked Grievances Spring Bend Court; the Right Court, the Tai’s Slaughter and Nine Darks Court; the Central Court, the Sinful Qi and Salty Pond Court. The Middle Prime’s three palaces and nine courts total forty-two ministries, their examinations no different from the Upper Prime.

The Lower Prime Water Office is subordinate to the Grand Purity Realm, formed by the coalescence of the *qi* of Wind and Marsh, and the essence of Dawn’s Vastness. Its Central Palace is named the Yang Valley Cavern Spring Palace, also called the Azure Florescence Square Palace, containing left, right, and central courts: the Left Court is named the Azure Primordial Spirit Name Court; the Right Court, the Nine Springs Cold Night Court; the Central Court, the Northern Prime Azure Spirit Court.

The Left Palace is named the Azure Spirit Palace, containing three courts: the Left Court is named the Spirit Kalpa Court; the Right Court, the Long Night Court; the Central Court, the Numinous Treasure Kalpa Blade Court. The Right Palace is named the Fengdu Palace, containing three courts: the Left Court is named the Kalpa Measure of Liberation Court; the Right Court, the Spring Bend Ghost Spirit Court; the Central Court, the Great Kalpa of Communicating Spirit Court. The Lower Prime’s three palaces and nine courts total forty-two ministries, their examinations no different from the Middle Prime.

The Three Primes together comprise nine palaces, twenty-seven courts, and one hundred twenty ministries. The left governs matters of life, the right matters of death. Merits are recorded in the green register of the left court; sins are inscribed in the black register of the right court. If sins are mingled with blessings or blessings with sins, they are not assigned to a single ministry. Attainments of the Dao are reported to the Central Palace; merits to the left court; sins to the right court. Every Three Prime day, they assemble for review and submit reports to the Three Offices.

The Twelve River Sources.
The Dark Master states: The twelve celestial divisions correspond to the twelve river sources, which report to the Boundless and flow into the Heavenly River’s Eastern Well source. Cheng Xuanying’s commentary: This elucidates the flowering of yellow water and the refinement and deliverance of dead souls.

The twelve correspond to the twelve months of the year. The "river sources" refer to the Heavenly River. The heavens comprise the twenty-eight lunar lodgings, and the Eastern Well star is the source of the Heavenly River, the fountainhead of all waters. The moon is the essence of Great Yin and the mother of all waters. As the moon moves, it completes one circuit of the heavens each month, and in a year of twelve months, there is one day each month when the moon conjoins, always at the Flowering Pond of the Eastern Well, where it spouts water to irrigate. This is the place where dead souls are refined and delivered. Thus it is called the Twelve River Sources, clarifying the matter. This is also seen in the *Scripture of the Three and Five in Harmonious Motion*.

It liberates ancestral forebears and kin of countless kalpas, swiftly erasing the ledgers of sins, extinguishing the roots of evil, preventing their detention and forcing them into the company of ghosts. **Jade Clarity Writ of Summons.** **Talisman and Mandate Chapter. Jade Clarity Writ.**

The Primordial Beginning’s talismanic mandate, timed and ordained for ascension. In the Northern Capital’s Cold Pond, the departments guard the forms and souls, restraining demons and ensuring protection. The Dharma states: "Restrain demons, ensure protection, and deliver people." Deliver the ranks to the Southern Palace, where dead souls undergo refinement and are transformed into immortals. Those who receive deliverance in their living bodies endure through kalpas, revolving with the ages, their years equaling Heaven’s, forever transcending the Three Servitudes.

**Noon. Kun. Xun Writ.**

The Three Offices are servitudes. The Heavenly Servitude is named Ke Hanming; the Human Servitude, Xingshengzhuan; the Earthly Servitude, Dulixian. Sever the Heavenly Servitude’s gate of corporeal desire in the realm of the dead, sparing one from the Heavenly Office’s labor of driving thunder and chasing lightning. **Noon.** Sever the Earthly Servitude’s gate of affectionate desire in the realm of the dead, sparing one from the Earthly Office’s labor of carrying sand and bearing stones. **Kun.** Sever the Human Servitude’s gate of covetous desire in the realm of the dead, sparing one from the Water Office’s labor of dredging waves in the dark sea. **Xun.**

**Five Sufferings. Shen. Yin. Hai. Si. You Writ. Eight Difficulties.**

The Dark Master states: The Three Servitudes and Five Sufferings together constitute the Eight Difficulties. Deliver from the first suffering of the color-bond gate, sparing one from the bitter paths of the Mount Tai Hell. **Shen.** Deliver from the second suffering of the love-bond gate, sparing one from the bitter paths of the Wind-Knife Hell. **Yin.** Deliver from the third suffering of the greed-bond gate, sparing one from the bitter labor of carrying sand and bearing stones. **Hai.** Deliver from the fourth suffering of the flower-competition gate, sparing one from the bitter labor of filling seas and digging rivers. **Si.** Deliver from the fifth suffering of the bodily-bond gate, sparing one from the bitter paths of swallowing fire, eating coals, and boiling cauldrons. **You.**

Transcend the Three Realms, roam freely in the Highest Clarity. **Jade Clarity Writ transferred to Highest Clarity Writ of Summons.**

The above is the main text, the revealed mandate of the Primordial Heavenly Honored One, recorded by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord.

**Precious Taboo Chapter**

In the heavens of Highest Clarity, the Heavenly Emperor of Jade Perfection dwells in the Boundless Realm of Brahman Conduct. *Yin heng*, also pronounced *xia meng*. The Dark Master states: Brahman conduct is the Dao within the Dao, the mystery within the mystery, true emptiness without obstruction. Above the Three Realms and below the Jade Clarity, above the Grand Clarity, there is a Heavenly Emperor named the Jade Perfection Heavenly Emperor, who is the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven and the Heavenly Honored One of the Lofty and Mysterious Vault. He governs the Boundless Realm of Brahman Conduct, which is the celestial realm of the seed people. It is also said that the Jade Dawn Dao Lord abides in the Boundless World of the Highest Clarity’s Great Possession Heaven.

Xue Youqi’s annotation: *Jing* means body; *se* means substance. A body without color has form yet no color, its appearance as if empty space—hence it is called Brahman conduct. *Xia meng* cut.

Li Shaowei’s annotation: A body without color has only the qi of Great Brahman flowing through it. Pronounced as a level tone. *Jing jing* and *xing* are read as two syllables, and the scriptural meaning remains coherent.

**The Eight Heavens of the East**

Step through the Dipper, Ox, Girl, Void, Danger, House, and Wall, drawing qi according to their colors, the Dipper’s stem in the Brahman heavens. The Six Heavens of the Desire Realm have all six senses defiled—hence the name Desire Realm. The scripture states: If a person’s oral karma is pure and they possess ten virtuous deeds or more, they may be reborn in the heavens of the Desire Realm.

The six senses remain defiled. The Grand Once-Heaven, where the northwest Brahman qi is received, drawing from the divisions of the Straddling and Wall constellations. All references to *Brahman* denote the four corner heavens, with *corner* being the Horn. These corner heavens do not belong to the principal constellations but are formed by borrowing qi from the two adjacent constellations—hence the term *Brahman qi*. The following three heavens follow this pattern. The heavens of the four cardinal directions correspond to the divisions of the twenty-eight constellations.

The heavens above belong to the Realm of Desire, where beings possess form and desire, cling to sensory objects, engage in yin-yang union, and are born of wombs—hence the name Realm of Desire.

The *Tai Zhen Canon* states: In the first two heavens, karmic retribution is still coarse, and desire is fulfilled through bodily union; in the next two heavens, desire is fulfilled by holding hands; in the fifth heaven, by speaking; and in the sixth heaven, by gazing. Now, corresponding to the six desires, these six heavens arise. With each desire-root roughly purified, one ascends to a higher heaven; when all six desires are fully purified, one transcends the Realm of Song and ascends to the Realm of Form.

The Realm of Form comprises eighteen heavens, where beings possess form but no desire, yet there are six colors and eighteen dusts: six heavens of coarse dust, six heavens of subtle dust, and six heavens of light dust.

The six heavens of coarse dust are as follows:
First is the Heaven of Precious Dust.

**The Eight Heavens of the North**
Following the constellations *Bù Kuí, Lóu, Wèi, Xù, Bì, Zǐ, Shēn*, and their deviations, black is derived from form. This is the central Dipper of the Brahmā Heaven.

The four heavens of the Formless Realm are utterly true and passionless, untouched by yin and yang. Their inhabitants are born through transformation, nourished solely by fragrant qi, free from the afflictions of form and substance.

The scripture states: "When a person’s heart and deeds are pure, possessing six hundred virtues, they are born into the Formless Realm."

The Hào Tíng Xiāo Dù Heaven, suffused with azure qi. The Emperor Huì Jué Hūn.

The heaven of *Wéi* and *Jiǎo* lies to the southwest, suffused with Brahmā-black, corresponding to the divisions of the *Shēn* and *Jǐng* constellations.

The *Zī* constellation. The Emperor whose name is Tuó oversees the governance of demon kings. He resides in the Shén Líng Yōu Palace and governs the south of the west, at the *gēng* position. Those who have entirely forgotten past causes and the mind-consciousness dwell in this heaven. This heaven does not require the forgetting of both, thus when needed, it exists; when unneeded, it vanishes. If both emptiness and existence are entirely absent, one loses the responsiveness within the true. For within emptiness lies the true, and within the true lies responsiveness, giving rise to the ten thousand images, all emerging from emptiness. The myriad dharmas reside in the mind, yet possess no form or appearance. This guides disciples to observe the mind—whether existent or non-existent—whereupon they ascend into the Jìn Shàng Heaven.

The Tài Sù Xiù Lè Jìn Shàng Heaven, suffused with yellow qi. The Emperor Lóng Luó Jué Zhǎng.

The Emperor’s taboo name is Pò, governing and recording the demon kings, dwelling in the Huà Líng Palace, and governing the north of the east in the west. When the observation of *qi* transforms into subtlety and all habitual tendencies are forgotten, if one penetrates into the natural, one ascends into the Zhǒng Mín Heaven. The four heavens above are called the Formless Realm.

The *Tài Zhēn Kē* states: "Within the Formless Realm, the human body is subtle and wondrous, no longer possessing form or color. Since it shares the formless and is invisible, it is called the Formless. The beings of the Three Realms have not severed the root of birth and death, and the *qi* of yin and yang still remains, thus they have lifespans. Some ascend into higher realms, while others descend to be born among humans, revolving endlessly according to the height or lowness of their merit, ceasing only upon attaining the Dao."

The lifespans of heavenly beings are not fully recorded here.

The Sì Wéi Mín Heaven is where both worldly karma and habitual tendencies are entirely purified. Having forgotten all habitual tendencies, one transcends the Zhǒng Mín Heaven. Afflictions form knots, while learning forms habits.

The Tài Xū Wú Shàng Cháng Róng Heaven, suffused with green *qi*. The Emperor oversees all ghosts and spirits.

The Emperor’s taboo name is *Jīng Shàng*, who delivers the bodies of learners. He resides in the Heavenly Protection Palace, governing the north of *Xū* in the West.

The four heavens above are the Four Peoples’ Heavens, also called the Seed Peoples’ Heavens. The people of these four heavens exist beyond the dual *qi* of yin and yang, without limits of years or lifespan, delighting in purity and stillness.

The *Tài Zhēn Kē* states: "Ascending to the four heavens, one penetrates the realm of the Dao, rising and falling with *qi*, beyond the reach of calamity. Beyond this, one attains the natural, non-active realm of the Great Cavern."

Li Shaowei’s annotation: The *qi* of the thirty-two heavens and their associated stellar lodges, emperors’ taboo names, and governance are recorded in the *Dòng Shén Jīng*. The purity or defilement of roots and dust is expounded in the *Lóng Qiāo Jīng*.

The above main text was spoken by the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning.

The thirty-two heavens, thirty-two emperors, hidden taboos of the heavens, hidden names of the heavens, the hollow emptiness within the heavens, the natural numinous chapters, the hidden rhymes of the heavens, the sounds within the heavens, the venerables within the heavens, the spirits within the heavens, the great demons within the heavens, the numina within the heavens.

The hollow emptiness refers to the great void within the heavens. The eightfold numinous script, the natural jade characters, are not crafted but spontaneously formed—hence called the natural numinous chapters. The hidden rhymes are the concealed verses of the middle section, the sounds within the thirty-two heavens, their melodies and tones obscured, their purport profound—hence called hidden rhymes. The hidden taboos and hidden names are the titles of the most venerable great spirits, demon kings, and immortal numina within the heavens. The venerables include *Hē Mó*, a designation of the Primordial Beginning, and *Wǎn Shǒu*, an inner name of the Dao Lord. The spirits include the spirit *Ā Nà* and the demon *Jiǔ Chǒu*. The great demons include *Mó Luó*, the great demon of the heavens, all of whom are demon kings within the heavens. The numina include *Yù Fù*, the numinous youth within the Dipper, and *Pó Ní*, the fire-refined numinous youth. These are briefly cited as evidence; a detailed explication cannot be given here.

Nine harmonies and ten unions transform into the Upper Clarity.

The mysteries of the boundless are too profound for detailed explication. The divine perfected scatter and descend, universally delivering heaven-dwellers and humans. Nine is yang; ten is yin. The sacred taboos and numinous chapters, the inner tones and hidden rhymes, are formed from the conjoined qi of yin and yang, harmonizing and transforming across the three realms of the heavens—so abstruse their profundity that no name or word can encompass them. This is the wondrous qi of the divine and perfected, spreading and unfolding, above in the heavens and below among humans, broadly delivering all beings.

The above is the main text, recorded by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord.

**Chapter on Receiving Deliverance**
Today, joyously celebrating the reception of deliverance, one passes through the barriers of the heavens, from the *xū*-text to the *chén*-text. Passing through the barriers of the heavens, one hundred twenty numinous officials of each govern the gates and announce to the heavens. They request the eradication of the three evils: the extinguishing of the hellish evil paths from *kūn* to *gèn*; the extinguishing of the lower ghostly evil paths from *gèn* to *kūn*; and the extinguishing of the beastly evil paths from *chén* to *xū*. One hundred twenty numinous officials each transmit talismans to absolve sins and deliver suffering souls.

The Mystic Master states: In requesting the heavens to eradicate the three evils, the internal causes are the three karmic deeds of body, heart, and mouth, while the external causes are the transgressions of the three poisons—greed, hatred, and delusion—which lead to falling into the three evil paths of hell, lower ghosts, and beasts. Having today received deliverance in the Jade Clarity, one’s life, according to the celestial stems *jiǎ* and *yǐ*, ascends to belong to the thirty-two heavens. Master and disciple pass through the barriers, requesting the eradication of the three evils: internally eliminating the three karmic deeds of body, heart, and mouth, and externally severing the three poisons of food, hatred, and delusion. Thus, there is no means by which one may fall into hell, no means by which one may enter the path of lower ghosts, and no means by which one may transform into a beast. Even after receiving deliverance and eradicating the three evils, if the three karmic deeds and poisons are not internally and externally extinguished, one is still not exempt from falling.

**Severing the Earthly Roots**
The *chén*-text severs the root of earth;
the *xū*-text severs the root of the womb;
the *hài*-text severs the root of the placenta;
the *zǐ*-text severs the root of knots;
the *duì*-text severs the root of joints;
the central text severs the root of desire;
the *zhèn*-text severs the roots of the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, tongue, body, and mind—
all of which are the earthly roots.
One hundred twenty numinous officials each, following the incantations, descend and summon the qi of the eastern direction, blowing it into the body to sever all roots of the paths of death.

**Flying Deliverance through the Five Gates**
Flying deliverance through the gate of color and encumbrances, the *shēn*-text;

**Flying Deliverance through the Five Gates** *(continued)*
Flying deliverance through the gate of love and encumbrances, the *yín*-text;
flying deliverance through the gate of greed and encumbrances, the *hài*-text;
flying deliverance through the gate of emotion and encumbrances, the *sì*-text;
flying deliverance through the gate of desire and encumbrances, the *yǒu*-text.
One hundred twenty numinous officials each, capable of opening the gates of suffering.

**Enrollment in the Great Mystery**
The *Upper Clarity* text of enrollment in the Great Mystery.
One hundred twenty numinous officials, who inscribe the names of disciples in the Heavenly Ministry of the Great Mystery.

**Demon Kings’ Supervision and Recommendation**
The *Jade Clarity* text of demon kings’ supervision and recommendation.
One hundred twenty numinous officials, who command demons to safeguard and recommend the affairs of disciples.

**The Unrestrained Heavenly Gate**
The *qián*-text of the Unrestrained Heavenly Gate.
One hundred twenty numinous officials, who issue celestial certificates for those who attain the Dao, allowing them to pass through the Heavenly Gate.

The method states: When the Great Mystery’s demon kings supervise the deliverance of people, eradicating evil roots, they restrain demons to recommend and deliver ranks to the Southern Palace. When the earthly roots are severed, the Great Mystery’s demon kings supervise and allow ascent through the Heavenly Gate.

The Mysterious Master says: In human life, above are the twelve joints—roots of the dead *qi* transmitted by parents; in the middle are the twelve knots—roots of the dead *qi* received in one’s body; below are the twelve placenta and wombs—roots of the dead *qi* transmitted to descendants. All are earthly roots. Thus, on the day of deliverance, one must sever them, internally eliminating the thirty-six roots and externally restraining the six roots from evil destinies. When the earthly roots are severed and debts sealed within the form, one may then fly through the five gates, have their name enrolled in the Great Mystery, be supervised by demon kings, and ascend through the Heavenly Gate. All flesh and bone ascend together on the day of rising to Jade Clarity—this is the essence of deliverance. The method for sealing debts and enclosing the form is detailed in separate regulations.

The above is the main text, the *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s* passage through the barriers, recorded by the *Jade Clarity Dao Lord*.

Some identify the twenty-eight lunar lodges—seven lodges in each of the four directions—as the four directional Dippers, with what is now called the Northern Dipper as the Central Dipper. Citing *The Treatise on Celestial Offices* as evidence: "The Dipper is the Emperor’s chariot, revolving at the center and governing the four directions." Since the people of the Divine Continent dwell south of the Pole, observing from the north, it is called the Northern Dipper. *The Oral Instructions of Perfected Unity* also states: "Within the Dipper are five Dippers: *Yang Brilliance* is the Eastern Dipper, *Yin Essence* is the Western Dipper, *Cinnabar Origin* is the Southern Dipper, *Northern Culmen* is the Northern Dipper, and *Celestial Barrier* is the Central Dipper." The accounts differ, so both are preserved.

Nurturing beings, spreading primal spring.
Cloud-dragons harness the solemn chariot,

Withered sprouts float, drenched and revived,

With folded hands and kneeling, we bear vast benevolence.

Seven regulators guard the numinous altar.
Washing the bells, casting fire transformations,
The mighty sword coils the giant dragon.
Far off, the pure numinous perfected—
Who dares violate the luminous statutes?
Binding and restraining demonic ghosts,
Chilling winds sweep the celestial void.
Pernicious *qi* now stilled,
The myriad heavens swiftly pacified.
True companions bear great shelter,
Bowing foreheads, singing in joy.

Precious chambers, names of melodies resplendent,
Brightness befits the abode of spirits.
Wandering freely, the cloud paths open wide,
Gazing toward the true capital.
The celestial sun never sets,
Thick mists seal the azure hut.
The Supreme’s vermilion seal unfolds,
Silk and bamboo display the simple writ.
Favorable winds plant the mysterious transformation—
Yin and Xin surely have surplus.

The Black Thearch, Perfector of Unfolding Blood, bears the surname *Mysterious* and the personal name *Luminous Sprout*.
He resides in the North, governs Water, internally corresponds to the kidneys, and ensures the free flow of blood vessels, nourishing the entire body.

The Black Thearch’s hymn says:
Formless, yet it governs all things,
Abyssal—O heart of the Supreme.
The Dao neither opens nor emits,
Yet harbors profound transformative mechanisms.
Fear lest your leaks remain unstaunched,
And yin thoughts drown in excess.
Wheeling waves without bound,
The bitter path leads astray.
Ten thousand years of vigilance,
One day of self-oblivion.
Without equanimity, you fall into ghostly realms—
Calamity and retribution cannot be borne.

The Yellow Thearch, Central Lord
*Jade* Text.

The Yellow Thearch, Perfector of the Central Lord, bears the surname *Hemp* and the personal name *Loyal Caution*.
The myriad spirits do not transgress.

*Qian* Text.
The Perfector of the Myriad Spirits Without Transgression resides in the Center, governs Earth, internally corresponds to the spleen, and regulates the constructive and defensive *qi* of the central palace, restraining the myriad spirits to prevent disorder.
Within the body, the liver stores the *hun*, the lungs store the *po*; in the Crimson Palace and Cinnabar Field, the two *qi* intertwine—vermilion *qi* descends, mysterious spring ascends.
The heart stores blood, the kidneys store essence; the two *qi* cycle and reciprocally nurture within the Yellow Court, where spirit and intent reside.

The Yellow Thearch’s hymn says:
The myriad heavens bow to the central pole,
Reining the jade pool’s root.
The trigger spans eons,
Luminous clarity opens the four gates.
The Great Possession blends with the August Perfected,
Disciplining the starry souls.
Without the Thearch’s Dao, nothing moves—
All directions rely on its presence.
Wrath brings frost and autumn,
Harmony heralds spring’s warmth.
Grasping the primal record of generation,
We look up to bear the original limit.

Xue Youqi’s note:
The Five Thearchs in heaven govern the five directions;
The immortals on earth govern the five sacred peaks;
The ghosts and spirits within humans govern the five viscera.
Each spirit has its ruler.
Humans emulate earth, earth emulates heaven, heaven emulates the Dao, the Dao emulates spontaneity.
Spirits have their abode, hence no transgression—
The three harmonize to perfect virtue.

*Guarding the Perfected* Chapter
Knock the teeth thirty-two times, visualize the body as the divine lord, and recite:

The Azure Heaven Demon King *Bayuan Choubo*,
*Yin-mao* text, *tiao*.

The Great Demon King of the Eastern Azure Heaven, surnamed *Fu*, personal name *Chicheng Ba*.
Born with the Primordial Beginning, he commands the Nine Heavens.
*Choubo* is the Demon King of the Three Realms.
He oversees the disciples of the Three Realms—
Those who recognize his sound enjoy blessings; those who do not suffer calamity.
If the Demon King recommends you, your body enters the Three Clarities.

The Azure Heaven Demon King’s Jade Text for Restraining Evil:
Lush and verdant, crystalline azure,
Cavernous vistas unfold in brightness.
The first yang of the nine *qi*,
Pauses to nurture the *hun* in blossoming splendor.
Flowing essences fill the wondrous palace,
Spiritual perfected ascend as gods.
Jade-green cloud crowns,
Winged multitudes in radiant flight.
Azure-waisted jade maidens,
Supreme Perfected.
Protect and convey the immortal register,
Dispel demons and banish miasma.

The Vermilion Heaven Demon King *Futian Danshi*,
*Si-wu* text, *tiao*.

The Great Demon King of the Southern Vermilion Heaven, surnamed *Fo*, personal name *Yousu*.
His might can halt the heavens, his strength can topple mountains.

Obstructing merit and virtue,
Disciplining and subduing all spirits.

The Vermilion Heaven Demon King’s Jade Text for Restraining Evil:
Flourishing yang, true elder,
Vermilion spirit, honored deity.
Commanding the Cinnabar Heaven,
Inspecting and restraining demonic hordes.
Sternly driving the crimson phoenix,
The three-horned unicorn.
The upper Dao prospers in the Grand Clarity,
Root of the Mysterious Origin.
Fire dances with the three *qi*,
Winding through crimson clouds.
Nurturing the cinnabar palace,
Ensuring enduring restraint.

The White Heaven Demon King *Fanshan Liumu*,
*Shen-you* text, *tiao*.

The Great Demon King of the Western White Heaven, surnamed *Chi*, personal name *Zhangshi*, with one head and six eyes.
He can shatter mountains and overturn stones,

Sevenfold luminous *qi*,
Threefold primordial perfected.
Within resides the August Elder,
Restraining and seizing demonic essences.
The officers of *geng-xin*,
Seven hundred thousand troops.
Feathered banners, dragon tally,
Golden tigers, cloud-borne steeds.
Severing and dispelling pernicious delusions,
Refining and nurturing blossoming essences.
Abiding with the Dao in perpetuity,
Unshaken through kalpas.

The Black Heaven Demon King *Jianchou Langfu*,
*Hai-zi* text, *tiao*.

The Great Demon King of the Northern Black Heaven, surnamed *Xu*, personal name *Zhishi*, fierce and hideous by nature, delighting in slaughter.

The Black Heaven Demon King’s Jade Text for Restraining Evil:
Northern darkness, crimson and dense,
Palace of the mysterious *qi*.
The Thearch’s true spirits convene,
Driving gods and charioting dragons.
Within the chamber, jade maidens,
Luminous youths.
Grasping the talismanic register,
Seizing and restraining demonic traces.
The Void and Danger conjoin in transformation,
Purple mists stir the wind.
Precious crystals refine and nurture—
The posterior heaven knows no end.

The Yellow Heaven Demon King *Hengtian Danli*,
*Zhongzhi* text, *zhongwen*.

The Great Demon King of the Central Yellow Heaven, surnamed *Heavenly Gate*, personal name *Bowang*.
The Demon King wears robes of dark patterns, a crown piercing the heavens, a sword with a dragon-head hilt at his waist, and rides a feathered-wheel chariot, soaring through the clouds.
He often composes ballads of three thousand words, disrupting later disciples.
The Supreme recorded his songs in the *Scripture for Dispelling Demons*.

Xue Youqi’s note:
The Demon Kings’ four-character titles denote their positions; the middle two characters are their personal names; the last two are their courtesy names.

The *Inner Image of the Cinnabar Principle* note:
Old accounts claim the Demon King composes ballads to disrupt later disciples. Upon reflection, this is not so.
The Demon King does not deliberately disrupt later disciples—he tests them.

The Demon King of the Form Realm’s hymn says:
My realm is hard to cross,
Thus I compose cavernous texts,
Transforming and soaring through space,
To test your resolve.
Though many seek the Dao,
Few are steadfast in faith.
They covet empty fame,
Neglecting true practice—
How can the Demon King not test them?
Those tested and steadfast are recommended for perfection;
Those disrupted bear the fault of weak resolve—
What blame lies with the Demon King?

The Yellow Heaven Demon King’s Jade Text for Restraining Evil:

The Primordial August Supreme, revered in profound subtlety,
Unites true simplicity, the root of creation’s origin.
Moved by the obscure and subtle, the Great Spirit emerges,
Commanding and summoning the myriad qi, gathering in the Flower Chamber.
Dispelling the hundred demons, flourishing with the Dao.
Preserving deliverance, averting calamity, dissolving trials and misfortune.

The Five Thearchs of the Great Demons—Zhen, Dan, Dui, Kan, and the Central Text—
are the lords of all spirits.

The Azure Thearch of the East, Great Demon King;
The Vermilion Thearch of the South, Great Demon King;
The White Thearch of the West, Great Demon King;
The Black Thearch of the North, Great Demon King;
The Yellow Thearch of the Center, Great Demon King—
these are not the Five Thearchs and Five Heavenly Demon Kings of former times,
but rather great demons distinct beneath the Five Thearchs,
hence Yan Dong records their names to distinguish them.

The Azure Thearch Demon King: surname Poluo, personal name Wanxing.
The Vermilion Thearch Demon King: surname Zhe, personal name Shangbai.
The White Thearch Demon King: surname Deng, personal name Hu’er.
The Black Thearch Demon King: surname Nie, personal name Gongsun.
The Yellow Thearch Demon King: surname Wangong, personal name Chansheng.

Each commands an official retinue of thirty-eight thousand,
born together with the Five Heavens, governing the Three Realms,
their merit equal to that of all heavens, thus they are the lords of ghosts and spirits.

The *Inner Image of the Cinnabar Principle* note:
The *Hidden Writ of Jade Clarity* states that the Five Thearchs of the Great Demon Kings,
commanding their official retinues, are born with Heaven,
vexing and disrupting practitioners, unwilling for them to achieve the Dao.
Yet they boast of equaling the sacred merit of the Heavenly Thearchs.
Later, during the Dragon Han’s unfolding of the cosmic pattern,
they submitted to the transformation of the Primordial Beginning.
Thus the *Hymn of Pacing the Void* says:
The Demon Kings respectfully receive their charge,
and so are able to attend upon all heavens.
From this, it follows that if a practitioner firmly upholds their original resolve,
accumulating merit and manifesting conduct,
the Demon Kings will revere and serve them,
how then could they dare to deploy demonic legions?

**Incantation of the Nine-Black Azure Numinous Origin Elder, Azure Thearch Demon-Quelling King of the East**
Radiant cavern illuminates the primordial essence,
Azure splendor unfolds great brightness.
Dispersing and nurturing the qi of the Nine Heavens,

Wielding the staff, consulting the registers,
Proclaiming cavernous chapters, unfolding divine texts.
Untying knots, scattering the roots of misfortune,

No demonic trial can stand before them.
Preserving deliverance across the kalpas’ ford,

In supreme subtlety, lush brightness flourishes.

Drawing sound to extend the primal qi,
Golden crystal nurtures the Three Fields.

Even in the nether realms, no entanglement remains.

Aligning wheels with the Most High Immortals.

**Incantation of the Five-Qi Five Numinous Mysterious Elder, Black Thearch Demon-Quelling King of the North**
The Northern Mystery’s Three Elegances suffuse,
The Supreme Purple Thearch resides.
Gathering qi to govern the obscure and secluded,
Creation unfolds the numinous net.
Below, it governs the Void and Danger’s essence,
Precious nurturing in the Heavenly Origin’s chamber.
Spirit communicates with the supremely subtle divine,
Enveloping and guarding the hundred barriers.
Expansive and free, it annihilates demonic trials,
Misfortunes and calamities forever cease to threaten.
The Great Dao preserves the natural,
Lifespan knows no depletion.
Through ten thousand kalpas, it enjoys blessed assemblies,
Ascending to the cloud chariot in broad daylight.

**Incantation of the One-Black Primordial Numinous Origin Elder, Yellow Thearch Demon-Quelling King of the Center**
In harmonious transformation, returning to profound subtlety,
The Primordial August unites the Thearch’s numen.
The Perfected Elder seals the Yellow Portal,
The Four Governors align the mysterious balance.
The Round Flower ascends to the Great Canopy,
Together they support the steadfast Jade Lord.
Congealing the ford to secure the hundred bones,
Jade radiance embraces the embryonic immortal.
Morning brilliance infuses the luminous scene,
Demons respond by self-annihilating their forms.
The myriad Dao preserve wholeness,
Reversing age to return to infancy.
The Five Assemblies merge into one qi,
Soaring in flight to transcend the Cloud Capital.

Soaring in flight, drumming in procession,
Commanding the ghostly legions.
**Jade Text:** Commander of the Ghostly Legions, Great Primordial Master of the Three Heavens.
Brandishing the banner, beating the drum, striking the baton,
**Jade Text:** The Nine Heavens’ August Father wields the banner,
the Left-Commanding Divine King holds the standard,
the Right-Governing Great Spirit strikes the drum,
the rear phalanx of valiant warriors wields the baton,
the Heavenly Ding lead the vanguard.
Roaming and observing the great void,
self-styled as the Illustrious and Resplendent,
**Jade Text:** All heavens equal in merit.
The Illustrious and Resplendent Heavenly Generals of the Jade Clarity,
all under the command of the Jade Clarity’s Divine Duke, Supreme Minister of the Great Mystery.
Equal in merit with the Great Saints and Lofty Numinous Ones of all heavens,
self-styled as the Jade Clarity Numinous Treasure’s Illustrious and Resplendent Office.
The Illustrious and Resplendent Immortal Bureau,
specializing in the governance of the Numinous Treasure’s singular office.
Ascending to heaven to deliver humanity,
sternly restraining the Northern Feng.

The *Inner Image of the Cinnabar Principle* note:
The concluding verse of the Desire Realm’s soaring-in-space hymn says:
The Northern Capital’s Spring and Bend Prefecture,
harbors a host of ten thousand ghosts,
all eager to obstruct human destiny,
severing the gate of human life.
Ah! People chant cavernous chapters,
to restrain the Northern Feng Luo,
binding and dispatching demonic essences,
beheading and capturing at the Six Ghost Peaks.
The qi of all heavens billows,
my Dao daily ascends in glory.
For the Northern Feng’s ghosts and spirits are charged with killing,
delighting in obstructing destiny and severing life.
The Heavenly Worthy initiates deliverance,
the Demon Kings submit to transformation,
commanding and restraining the Ghostly Thearchs,
universally proclaiming covenants and decrees,
issuing orders and arrangements,
forbidding wanton harm.

The Divine Duke receives the mandate—
the Supreme Clarity’s Divine Duke, Supreme Minister of the Great Mystery,
right hand forming the Purple Tenuity Seal,
left hand holding the Jade Clarity’s text.
Knocking the teeth nine times,
visualizing the spirit in the form of the Divine Duke,
crowned with the Jade Clarity’s Grand Chancellor’s golden and azure sable coronet,
robed in brocade and rosy flying-feathered raiment,
girded with a grand sash, vermilion shoes, and crimson skirt,
seated amidst the three-colored clouds.

The Divine Duke is a minister of the Earthly Thearch and an heir of the Great Emperor of Mount Ma. The Horned Dragon is the father of the Great Spirit of the Chen constellation. His position is that of Jade Clarity’s Divine Duke, Supreme Minister of the Great Mystery, styled the Ma-Long Clan, with the personal name Kuo Yi. He universally sweeps away inauspicious forces.

*Strict Eastern Note:* The Divine Duke is the Grand Chancellor of the Great Luo Heaven. Receiving the Heavenly Worthy’s talismanic mandate, he sweeps away demonic essences and malevolent ghosts. The Eight Awes emit venom—*You* script. The Eight Awesome Great Spirits descend when summoned by the incantation, guarding the altar precinct.

The Shearing and Severing Ghost-Filth Great Spirit.

Demons dare not trespass; ghosts dare not conjure malevolence. Where there is truth, there is falsehood; where there is goodness, there is evil. Thus, the false can obstruct the true, and evil can destroy the good. By wielding this punitive might, driving out and exterminating, none may dare to trespass.

The above is the main text, wherein the Jade Morning Dao Lord proclaims the affairs of support, defense, sweeping, and purging, and the majestic might of the Jade Clarity’s Great Spirits.

The above main text was bestowed by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and recorded by the Jade Morning Dao Lord.

**Five Kalpas Opening Transformation, Primordial Cavern Jade Calendar Chapter**

True Yang unfolds transformation; Brahma qi flows freely. The Golden Watchtower stands above; the Jade Treasury resides in the East. Five scripts congeal; nine apertures radiate. Wondrous qi arises naturally, its profound mysteries unfathomable. Three Numinosities share a single thread; ten thousand sages take it as their origin. Examining and verifying cultivation and conduct, inscribing and recording true merit. Form and spirit both accord, merging with the Dao as one. Securely anchoring the imperial registers, enduring for a hundred million kalpas without end.

Of old, in the primordial chaos of Hunyuan, the Great Brahma pervaded the empty expanse. The myriad heavens were undivided; the nine yangs merged in darkness. Three causes, nine revolutions, six transformations, seven cycles—when the Primordial Beginning first took form, the five kalpas began their transformation. Thereupon, the Brahma Primordial Ancestor Morning Dao Lord was commanded to record the Heavenly Origin, riding the five kalpas’ revolutions.

Thus, the *Primordial Cavern* names the ancestral qi. The *Jade Calendar* records the Heavenly Origin. Five kalpas complete a cycle, returning to the One. From the One qi’s transformative division, the Three Causes form the Nine. Like dragons, like serpents, coiling through the nine paths, boundless and infinite, they encompass the primordial qi of the Nine Yangs. The Most High, by the three nines’ Brahma revolutions and the three fives’ primordial cycles, combined forty-two qi to initiate the Green Heaven’s primordial ancestral qi. Illuminating the East’s primordial Green Origin, corresponding to the Nine Yangs’ Wood Sovereign’s inception. Thus, the East obtained nine qi to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named Dragon Han.

Next, the nine causes repeated, re-accumulating yang qi, unfolding the luminous Red Script. Radiant light scattered and fell, five times unfolding the charts and cinnabar writings. The Most High, by the three fives’ revolutions and the threefold cinnabar flourishing, combined twenty-four qi to initiate the Southern Vermilion Heaven’s primordial ancestral qi. Illuminating the South’s primordial Vermilion Radiance, corresponding to the Three Yangs’ Fire Sovereign’s inception. Thus, the South obtained three qi to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named Red Clarity.

Next, the nine causes again accumulated, the Central Yellow transforming the Origin. Heavenly wefts coiled and enveloped; Brahma origins rode the five. The Most High, by the five fives’ cycles and the threefold yang revolutions, combined fifty-two qi to initiate the Central Yellow Heaven’s primordial ancestral qi. Illuminating the Central Numinous Yellow Florescence’s Origin, corresponding to the Five Yangs’ Earth Sovereign’s inception. Thus, the Center obtained twelve qi to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named Supreme Thearch.

Next, the nine origins repeated, the White Radiance inaugurated yang. Seven luminaries illumined Brahma; five wefts rode the heavens. The Most High, by the seven fives’ threefold revolutions, combined thirty-six qi to initiate the White Numinous Heaven’s primordial ancestral qi. Illuminating the West’s primordial White Radiance, corresponding to the Seven Yangs’ Metal Sovereign’s inception. Thus, the West obtained seven qi to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named Extended Prosperity.

Next, the nine origins completed their cycle, transformation merged and returned to the Origin, the One qi inaugurated illumination.

The Most High, by the two fives’ tenfold multiplication, accumulated threefold primordial yang, combining thirty voids to inaugurate the North’s Mysterious Heaven’s primordial ancestral qi. Illuminating the Supreme Dark’s primordial radiance, corresponding to the One Yang’s Water Sovereign’s inception. Thus, the North obtained five qi to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named Kaihuang.

With the five kalpas complete, the Vast Heaven formed its image. One qi merged with the Dao, eight realms streamed with light. Three accumulations, nine multiplications—eight directions unfurled their radiance. Eight Thearchs manifested their forms, the Nine Empyreans branched into transformations. Thus, the Primordial Celestial Venerable commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to inscribe the jade chronicle of kalpas, recording the inception of the Cavernous Undifferentiated Transformation and the cyclical origins of kalpic revolutions.

The heavens divided their realms and bound their primordial qi, the Cavernous Upright Yang’s qi forming the jade chronicle to record the kalpic destinies of Heavenly Perfected and Heavenly People, the path of merit’s ascent and retreat, and the nine grades of the Nine Sages. These profound mysteries are detailed in the *Scripture of the Nine Grades of Immortals’ Registers*.

The Five Kalpas and Five Qi:
- Longhan’s Primordial Azure qi: Azure.
- Red Brightness’s Cinnabar Radiance qi: Vermilion.
- Supreme Thearch’s Central Numinous qi: Yellow.

*Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humankind, Upper Chapter Scripture and Dharma, Scroll the Third*

The Disciples of the Tai Shang Sanwu Capital Register, Compiled and Annotated by Chen Chunrong:
The Primordial Cavern’s Jade Chronicle, the Jade Script held in both hands, preserved as divine treasure—Perfected Ones recite it.

Dragon Han and Yan Kang.
Vast and boundless, through kalpas uncounted—
Li Shaowei’s note: This chapter discusses the success and failure of kalpic destinies.
The *Guishan Primordial Record* states: The Primordial Cavern is the qi of the Supreme Thearch. The Heavenly Worthy condensed the qi of the Primordial Cavern to compose the Jade Chronicle. Its chronicle begins with the Dragon Han kalpa, opens with the Crimson Brightness kalpa as its inaugural chart, and concludes with the Yan Kang kalpa. Cyclical and endless, it ends only to begin anew. After the kalpa’s end, the Three Realms dissolve and crumble; the essences of the myriad beings abide eternally in the Great Void. Thus, Yan Kang is the designation for the kalpa’s dissolution, while Crimson Brightness is the name of the inaugural chart. The alternation of these two constitutes the Great Kalpa. Kaihuang and Shanghuang are names of lesser kalpas.

Within the primordial chaos, above there was no longer color, below there was no longer abyss. Wind and marsh pervaded the void; the Vajra rode the heavens.
The Mysterious Master said: This is the Heavenly Worthy expounding the fundamental origins of the Dao’s creation and the heavens’ unfolding, the beginning of the Five Kalpas’ formation.
Li Shaowei’s note: Wind and marsh are the qi of the Eighth Stratum. The qi of wind and marsh is firm and unyielding as metal, hence called Vajra, or also Rigid Wind. At the kalpa’s end, it fills the void and upholds the heavens without falling.
According to the *Nine Lands’ Inner Tone and Pure Numinous Elixir Scripture*, beneath the earth lie depths of billions of miles, reaching the Moist Marsh Land, whose qi is yellow. Another twenty billion miles below lies the Great Wind Marsh Land, whose qi is purple. Another twenty billion miles below lies another Great Wind Marsh Land, whose qi is azure. Beyond this, without end, boundless and fathomless, lies the Abyssal Nether Framework Land, whose qi is verdant. All are sustained by the Wind Brahma’s net-like framework, thus upholding the earth’s wheel, suspended without falling. Each of the Nine Strata has Four August Ones, totaling thirty-six August Ones. The Nine Strata and thirty-six lands correspond above to the thirty-six heavens. If scholars do not know the Inner Tone of the heavens above, the Heavenly Thearch will not recognize their names; if they do not know the Inner Tone of the lands below, the Earthly August Ones will not record their registers, and they will remain forever barred from attaining immortality. Below the earth, there are thirty-six. Between heaven above and earth below, there is no darkness, no obscurity, no form, no shadow, no limit, no end. The vast Brahma’s murkiness, boundless and lightless—then Crimson Brightness opens the chart, and the workings of salvation proceed naturally.

The Jade Script’s Kan Trigram.
The Dharma states: These are the sixty-four characters of the true scripture.

**Chapter of Flowing Transformations**
The Primordial Beginning securely establishes, the Jade Script.
Unfolds and scatters the Five Chapters.
The Jade Script.
These are the Five Scriptures that open the vastness.

**First Chapter**
The Five Chapters’ talismanic forms bear the Great Dharma.
Luminous qi germinates and nurtures; the essence of wood takes flight as blossoms. The qi of benevolence and kindness nourishes the myriad lives’ transgressions. Heaven’s boundaries and earth’s frameworks align with the seasons, all in rectitude. Radiance congeals in the divine realm, coalescing into the Azure Script. Its light illumines ten thousand miles, called the *Tai Qing Nine Perfected’s Peaceful Transformation and Supreme Loving Jade Talisman*.

**Second Chapter**
The Great Cinnabar’s qi extends its brilliance, pervading and resplendent. Drifting and scattering, it transforms into fire, smelting the Nine Yin. Crimson characters congeal into chapters, their script most wondrous. Its effulgence shines across nine hundred million, its essence bright and resplendent in the heavens. Called the *Intertwining Spirits’ Life-Brightening Jade Transformation Talisman*.

**Third Chapter**
The Yellow Perfected’s qi coalesces essence and scatters blossoms. The qi of the Central Void’s emptiness, the primordial chaos’ Yellow Origin’s essence, intermingle and flow through the pitch-pipes, transforming and resonating to engender script. Its light blazes ten thousand miles. Radiance and splendor blaze between the heavens’ ends, called the *True August’s Primal Cinnabar and Solemn Mysterious Talisman*.

**Fourth Chapter**
The Pure Might’s restraining qi flows and transforms into purity’s essence. Drifting authority illumines the spirits, congealing into script. Its light shines ten thousand miles, its script most wondrous. Arrayed brilliance congeals into radiance, its might crushing the myriad demons. Called the *Eight Might’s Dragon-Restraining, Tiger-Subduing, Flying Blossom’s Grand White Jade Transformation Talisman*.

**Fifth Chapter**
Mysterious essence radiates, the myriad beings take form. The wellspring of life is inexhaustible; the celestial chronicle has its records. The Jade Thearch’s High Minister, gazing upon the numinous transformations, gathers and selects the mysterious sequence, unfolding and illuminating the Heavenly Teachings. Investing the myriad Thearchs, the Mysterious Perfected resonates in harmony. Heavenly script unfolds in splendor, its canons bound by the Azure Pitch-Pipe. The great transformations of heaven reach completion, congealing into Jade Chapters. Its light shines across nine hundred million, called the *Luminous Net’s Mysterious Nine Transformations’ Grand Bright Talisman*.

The August One said: The Five Chapters are the Primordial Beginning’s naturally arising flying blossoms, the utmost essence of the Void’s primordial chaos’ qi, congealed into Jade Chapters, established above the Great Luo. In the first year of the Supreme Thearch, when stars and constellations clashed and malevolent omens descended, trespassing upon the Three Heavens, the Perfected Brahma Perfected One was commanded to bear the Five Chapters and bestow them upon the Five Thearchs to secure the celestial origin and govern celestial administration. The True Suchness Perfected One was further commanded to fast and uphold the Five Chapters, bestowing them upon the Five Marchmounts to secure the earth’s records and govern the earthly spirits. The Wondrous Conduct Perfected One was commanded to bear the Five Chapters and bestow them upon the masters of the renowned mountains, to await those who attain the Dao, to propagate the teachings and deliver beings from life and death. The qi of the Five Chapters’ efficacy is vast: above, it can dispel celestial calamities; in the middle, it can secure and pacify the nation’s mandate; below, it can deliver the multitudes. When summoning the Five Thearchs of the Three Realms and establishing altars and terraces, on the day of the earth’s sovereign, one should inscribe the Five Chapters in azure, white, and vermilion, unfolding them in the five directions. Then the myriad spirits will tremble and submit, gathering the host of immortals—summoned, they will arrive without fail. The detailed accounts of the Great Dharma are recorded here in brief.

The Crimson Script’s Jade Characters, the Eight Might’s Dragon Script.
The Jade Script.
Preserves and governs the kalpic destinies, ensuring the heavens endure eternally. The Brahma qi pervades the Luo; the myriad patterns unfold and expand.
The Jade Script’s Trigram.

The Mysterious Master said: From whence did the Primordial Beginning’s ancestral qi first engender the Jade Characters?
According to the *Numinous Treasure Jade Characters Scripture*: Before the Three Qi, after the primordial darkness, within it the true essence arose and the mysterious qi was born. Within the mysterious qi, there was a spirit called the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King.

Its qi congealed and coalesced, born coeval with the Primordial Beginning, flowing and transforming to crystallize fragrance—neither form nor appearance, now unfurling, now expanding. When the kalpa of Extended Prosperity dawned, the One Qi divided its form to become the Two Qi, and from the spontaneous void arose the Qi of the Beginning. The Two Qi condensed and solidified in the Great Void, suffusing and veiling the boundless; each character measured a zhang square, its eight corners trailing radiance—none could fathom its principle. The Two Qi, chaotic and undifferentiated, enveloped and concealed the Jade Characters.

When the kalpa of Dragon Han opened, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King apportioned the Two Qi, and the chaos first parted: the qi, pure and loftily limpid, formed heaven; the qi, descending and amassing, congealed into earth. From the division and union of the Two Qi arose the Harmonious Qi between them, named the Primordial Qi, also called the Great Brahma Qi.

When the kalpa of Crimson Clarity dawned, the Primordial Beginning unfolded the chart, and within it the True Yang Qi transformed into the Cavernous Yang Fire. The Primordial Beginning wielded the Cavernous Yang Fire to smelt and blend the Three Qi, fusing them with the Jade Characters to forge the Crimson Script. Thus the kalpa was named Crimson Clarity, and the script was called the Crimson Script’s Jade Characters.

Once the Three Qi formed the script, the fire refined it into the Crimson Script. The luminous qi and the essence of solar yang became the sun; the essence of numinous yang formed the moon; the residual radiance scattered and dispersed to become the myriad phenomena. The spirits of the Three Qi divided to become the Three Clarities’ sages.

Thereafter, the myriad patterns all emerged, the myriad beings all arose—none but the mysterious Primordial Beginning’s Three Qi. When the kalpa of Open Sovereignty dawned, the Three Qi were apportioned to engender the host of sages; when the kalpa of Supreme Antiquity arrived, the five kalpas unfolded as one, the Five Phases attained full form, and the myriad heavens were engendered. Within the span of the five kalpas, the essence of the Mysterious Center was produced, and within that essence, the spirit—hence the kalpa of Supreme Antiquity.

After the five kalpas opened and transformed, the *Scriptures of Jade Clarity’s Cavernous Perfection*, the *Scriptures of Highest Clarity’s Cavernous Mystery*, the *Scriptures of Grand Clarity’s Cavernous Spirit*, the Three Caverns’ scriptures, and the Four Auxiliary talismans—all arose from the transformation of the Crimson Script’s Jade Characters, formed by receiving the qi of the Numinous Treasure, refined by fire into script, becoming the Crimson Script’s Jade Characters.

Thereafter, the Primordial Beginning commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to inscribe its text, naming it the *Eight Might’s Dragon Script*, also called the *Script of the Eight Assemblies of the Myriad Heavens*. It was secreted within the Seven-Treasure Jeweled Terrace of the Highest Clarity’s Mysterious Capital, the Golden Chamber of the Purple Tenuity’s Supreme Palace, the Orchid Hall of the Eastern and Western Floral Halls, and the Mansion of the Nine Heavens’ Grand Auroral Radiance.

**Ascending Mystery Chapter**
The primordial net unfolds, the thirty-two heavens...

**Twenty-Eighth Lunar Mansion Mantle**

The eastern seven mansions begin at *chen* with Horn and Neck, proceeding leftward to Root, Chamber, and Heart at *mao*, then Tail and Winnowing Basket at *yin*. The northern seven mansions commence at *chou* with Dipper and Ox, passing through Girl, Void, and Rooftop at *zi*, then House and Wall at *hai*. The western seven mansions arise at *xu* with Straddler and Bond, continuing to Stomach, Mane, and Net at *you*, then Turtle Beak and Triaster at *shen*. The southern seven mansions initiate at *wei* with Well and Ghost, advancing to Willow, Star, and Spread at *wu*, then Wings and Chariot at *si*.

Revolving without color, they cycle through the ten directions; the Dipper pivots past the Winnowing Basket, from *chou* to *zi* along the upper four fingers, crossing the middle finger’s great joint, then returning to *chou* via the central line. From *zi* through *hai*, it traces to *yin*’s end. The revolutions govern the Five Constants—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—the five planets. Thirty-five divisions: the sun, moon, five planets, and twenty-eight mansions.

The primordial qi ascends to the Upper Origin, where Kan, Dui, Li, and Zhen converge at the central line, slanting to *hai*’s end. The *Primordial Net* is the warp of primordial qi. It clarifies how the Brahman qi unfolds across the thirty-two heavens, wheeling through the formless realm, encircling the ten directions. From the Dipper’s handle, it spirals leftward, traversing the Winnowing Basket, revolving the sun, moon, five planets, and twenty-eight mansions’ divisions, all converging at the Golden Gate of the Upper Origin.

The *Tortoise Mountain’s Cinnabar Sovereign’s Purple Text of the Cavernous Numinous Chapter* states:
*"The purple qi revolves leftward, linking with the Dipper,
Passing through the four sevens to enter the Golden Gate."*
This is illustrated in the *Primordial Net’s Unfolding* diagram.

The Eight Effulgences merge in darkness, qi entering the Mystery within Mystery—the Heaven within the Great Brahman Heaven. The dark union of the Jade Clarity’s Eight Effulgences’ celestial qi enters the Mystery within Mystery, the Heaven within the Great Brahman Heaven.

**Method of the Primordial Net’s Unfolding**

The Mystic Master says: The Western Tortoise Mountain, also called Dragon Mountain, signifies the Dao of Wood. The Metal Mother dwells there, embodying the essence of Metal. It is the root of the Nine Qi, the foundation of humanity’s Nine Palaces. The pivot is the Yellow Qi’s abyssal府, the true palace of Brahman qi. Located in the heavens’ northwest, at *hai* and *zi*, it is the root of the Infant’s birth. Spanning four million *li* in circumference, its limits defy measure, transcending ordinary numerical bounds.

Its height borders the Jade Clarity, ascending to the brain. Its meridians connect to the Jade Emperor’s Palace, its southeast touching the Cinnabar Yang’s radiance, above linking to the Azure Palace’s Divine Tiger Gate, joining the lung qi. It also communicates with the Great Stomach. To the northwest, it intersects the Cold Cavern’s wilderness, ascending to the Golden Gate’s immortal courtyard, exchanging qi with the kidney palace’s vital orifice. At the southern pole lies the Great Cinnabar’s Floating Black Realm, its qi harmonizing with the Cavern Yang’s light, aligning with the heart. Northward, it points to the Curved Array, interlocking with the Flowery Canopy, its qi treading the Vast Spirit, traversing the Yellow Palace, and centrally surging upward to the Jade Capital.

The twenty-four solar terms correspond to the twelve-storied tower. Eight pathways intersect, spanning three hundred thousand *li* of the Level Heaven—the convergence of the Three Qi. Gold wells forth as mounds, jade coalesces into gates, the true earth’s Jade Fluid Palace. The Golden Terrace and Jade Tower share the prior discussion. The Nine Palaces and Three Fields form the Twelve Spirit Chambers. Above flow the Purple Effulgence’s radiant palace, the Golden Flower’s hall, and the Jasper Jade’s chamber, flanked by five orifices—the convergence gate of the five viscera’s essences.

Naturally arising purple clouds interweave with phoenix-script patterns, nine-colored cascades arrayed. They permeate the four limbs, eight vessels, five viscera, and six bowels; crimson blossoms and purple florets generate the five internal qi. Cliffs birth purple cassia, ridges flourish with jasper groves, coral branches intertwine, jade roots take hold. The *Qian* grove bears fruit—crimson, purple, and white rings—its qi circulating without shelter to engender these treasures.

The Three Flowers bloom in the vermilion radiance, returning fragrance to flow through the Great Mystery. Inward vision illuminates the Three Luminaries, the Five Fragrances generating the Five Qi. The Eight Qi fan the winds with ceaseless drumming, jade pipes chant emptily to form sound—the sound of the inner void. Dragons roar in cloud towers, phoenixes cry on perilous ridges. Serpents of ten thousand fathoms coil in silence, divine palaces stand majestic, immortals swarm in profusion. Towering primordial halls exude sweet dew, manifesting the wondrous transformations of the Primordial Beginning, the true spiritual root of the Celestial Origin. This is the Great Brahman Qi’s circulation through the ten directions, distinct from the eastward-facing recitation position’s orientation.

**Primordial Net’s Unfolding Diagram**
*Northern and Southern Dynasties Yuan*

Another method states: The Primordial Net’s unfolding, likened to the human body’s correspondence with heaven’s flow, shares humanity’s primordial qi. It emanates from the Hall of Light Palace, the right kidney’s Gate of Life, ascending as the root of the Nine Heavens, belonging to the northwest *qian* direction’s pivot. The Great Abyss’s yellow qi ascends into the heart—Fire’s domain—revolving leftward through the Crimson Palace, flowing behind the brain’s Wind Gate and Jade Pillow Palace, then entering the left eye’s Sun Palace. Spiraling rightward, it descends past the northeast’s Winnowing Basket Mansion and the lesser yin of the foot’s great toe, circulating the body in a full cycle. Revolving around the right shoulder, it binds the Formless Realm, coiling into the right eye’s Moon Palace. Thereafter, it traverses the Five Constants, flowing from the thirty-five divisions of the spine into the lower cinnabar field’s left kidney Water Palace, surging into the liver Wood, coiling through the spleen Earth’s middle cinnabar field, then passing the lung Metal Palace. From the twelve-storied tower of the throat, it ascends through the Muddy Pellet Palace’s upper cinnabar field to the Fontanel Gate’s Spirit Valley, ultimately emerging at the Upper Origin—the so-called ascent to the Golden Gate’s courtyard.

The Three Palaces rise and descend, circulating endlessly. For humans, the meridians’ qi cycles through the body: in one day and night’s hundred *ke*, with 13,500 breaths of ascent and descent, they converge at the Wind Mansion. The vessels belong to yin, yin’s movement swift—like the Greater Yin’s monthly celestial cycle. Breath pertains to yang, yang’s movement slow—like the Greater Yang’s yearly celestial cycle. Thus, humanity’s breath, vessels, and primordial qi align with heaven’s constant measures.

When yin and yang flow in harmony, their currents follow the proper measures; when yin and yang unite, heaven attains harmony; when chanting and breath harmonize, humanity attains harmony.

**Contracting the Mysterious Chapter**
Within the Mysterious, the Supreme August One and the Lofty Perfected of the Highest Emperor—
The Mystical Master says: The Supreme August One within the Mysterious is the primordial qi of the Queen Mother of the West’s Eight Radiant Wonders, also called the Cinnabar August Lord. He is the Dao Lord of the Highest Emperor and the Sage Perfected of the Supreme August One. His vast radiance suffuses the great rosy clouds; his chanted verses resound through the Cavernous Chapters. Dwelling in the Palace of the Great Rosy Clouds of the Western Origin, he chants the empty and cavernous numinous verses to generate the myriad qi. His Golden Perfection shines resplendent, his flowing echoes traverse the cloud camps of the thirty-five heavens. The Jade Tone seizes the blackness, the numinous wind gathers the mists. The Purple Void flourishes in luxuriance, aiding and sheltering the ten thousand immortals. The Jade Tone seizes the qi of the highest realms, the numinous wind gathers the smoke of the demon-repelling mists. The purple radiance luxuriates in the Great Void, the ten thousand immortals aid and attend in audience—this is the secret formula of the Great Cavern’s revolving wind and coalescing fusion.

**Accomplishing Perfection Chapter**
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally accomplishing perfection.
Jade Script.
Xue Youqi’s commentary: It speaks of the cultivator of perfection: a thousand truths harmonize with spirit, ten thousand ways unite with qi. Truth merges with spirit in substance, the Way unites with qi in form—naturally accomplishing perfection.

Within perfection dwells spirit: the Great Lord of Longevity, *Ziwen*.
The Lord Who Delivers Destiny. Residing in the Life Gate Palace below the navel, his taboo name is Heavenly Perfect Fluid, his style is Soaring Life’s Supreme Flower. He wears crimson robes, in the form of the Primordial Beginning.

Yan Dong’s commentary: His style is *Xuyuan*.
Li Shaowei’s commentary: His style is *Xuyu*.

The Valiant Lord of Non-Being, *Chou-Wei*.
The spirit of the liver. Governing the Three Hun within the liver. Also called the Primordial Numinous Plain Lord, his taboo name is *Xuanxuan*, his style is *Hefu*. He wears purple robes and a lotus-flower crown.

The Venerable White Prime, *Yin-Shen*.
The spirit of the lungs. Governing the Seven Po within the lungs. Also called the White Prime Cavern Yang Lord, his taboo name is *Yulingbiao*, his style is *Xuanyijue*. He wears plain robes and a lotus-flower crown.

Xue Youqi’s commentary: The two spirits, Valiant Lord and White Prime, reside in the Cavern Chamber Palace, located two inches directly inward from the space between the eyebrows. The Valiant Lord also dwells at times in the liver, the White Prime also at times in the lungs.

**Grand Unity**
*Mao-You*. The Grand Unity resides in the brain, governing all spirits. He is the honored one among the hundred numina of the body, the master of the myriad spirits and ten thousand qi—thus called the Grand Unity. His taboo name is *Wuyoushou*, his style is *Guihuichang*. Also called the True Taboo Name of the Grand Unity is *Guiying*, his style is *Huayuan*. His form is like that of an infant, black above and red below. He wears upper purple embroidery and lower purple brocade, seated upon a golden bed within a jade canopy. In his right hand he grasps the North Culmen star, in his left the Northern Dipper. Upon his head he wears the Heaven-Piercing Crown, at his waist the Flowing Gold Fire Bells.

**Controller of Destiny**
*Chen-Xu*. The Controller of Destiny of the Highest Emperor. Residing in the heart to govern qi, he receives the primordial of life. His taboo name is *Limingchu*, his style is *Xuanduqing*. His form is white above and blue-green below, his face round and perfectly balanced. He wears yellow robes and a lotus-flower crown, in the form of the Primordial Beginning.

**Peach Vitality**
*Si-Hai*. **Joined Longevity**
*Wu*.

The Deities of the Two Kidneys
**Peach Vitality** resides in the navel to safeguard the root of essence. His title is *Joined Confluence Spirit*; his surname is *Tao*, his taboo name *Kang*. He wears purple robes and a lotus-flower crown, holding the *Jade Register of Longevity* in his lower left.

**Joined Longevity** dwells in the kidneys to guard the Gate of Life. His title is *Lord of the Gate of Life*; his surname is also *Tao*, his taboo name *Huichai*, his style *Joined Essence*. He wears vermilion robes and a lotus-flower crown, holding the *Heavenly August Talisman* in his lower right.

The taboo names and styles of *Peach Vitality* and *Joined Longevity* are spoken of interchangeably and are not their true designations.

**Visualization Diagram**
Grasping talismans and holding registers, they preserve life and secure its root. Together they hold the *Jade Talisman of the Omen* and the *Jade Register*, safeguarding the primordial root of the omen’s life. Ascending to the Upper Clarity, they enter and exit the Flower Chamber. The Upper Clarity spreads the Three Flowers in the Chamber of Separation and Convenience. Inwardly speaking, the Flower Chamber within the body is the heart. Within the Eightfold Darkness—where the eight vessels darkly converge—and amid the subtlest of subtleties, they penetrate the primordial qi. Below, they stabilize the human body: *Mud Pill* (the brain) and *Crimson Palace* (the heart). These perfected deities, with the Great One as their sovereign, are all gods of the Upper Clarity’s Grand Tenuity Palace. They descend in differentiated effulgences, entering the human body, and thus at times ascend again to the Upper Clarity, entering and exiting the Three Flower Chambers. Vastly encompassing the Eight Poles, minutely penetrating the finest filaments, they stabilize the human body, now in the *Mud Pill*, now in the *Crimson Palace*.

The *Mysterious Master* says: The Great One contains the flower like a lotus. The chamber of the Great One is the unopened lotus blossom.

**Diagram of the Great One Containing the Flower**
The pericardium embraces the eight vessels, ascending to connect with the Nine Colors and inwardly containing the Five Hues. The Great One contains the flower like a lotus.

The *Mysterious Master* says: The Upper Clarity is the Flower Chamber of the heart. The Great One containing the flower takes its form naturally; the Primordial Lady of the Great One resides within it, like the chamber of a lotus blossom before it opens. When the cinnabar flower enters the darkness, the body possesses eight vessels, and where they darkly converge is wholly gathered in the heart. Amid the subtlest of subtleties, they penetrate the primordial qi, all converging at the source of the spring.

Like the veins and vessels of plants and trees, they are comparable to the red-textured blood vessels of the human body—the pathways of the unified network of meridians and protective qi. Within, they order the Five Qi and blend the Hundred Spirits.

The *Mysterious Master* says: "Ordering the Five Qi within" means arranging the wondrous qi of the Five Spirits within the Five Qi of the Central Primordial, blending the Hundred Spirits internally. This is the method of the *Great Cavern’s Revolving Wind Blending*.

**Ten Revolutions Returning the Spirit, Myriad Qi Ascending as Immortals**
The *Myriad Qi* are the myriad spirits. When the Heavenly Worthy expounds the scripture ten times, Heaven opens to make the Ten Revolutions, thereby returning the Hundred Spirits to complete nature and transforming the Myriad Qi to ascend together as immortals.

The *Mysterious Master* says: The method of the Ten Revolutions is the Heavenly Worthy expounding the scripture ten times—the Dao of the Five Phases’ generation and completion. The first five expoundings yield the generative numbers of the Five Phases, curing deafness, blindness, muteness, lameness, chronic illnesses, and restoring form. The latter five expoundings yield the completion numbers of the Five Phases, even forming the sacred embryo and numinous spirit, reviving the dead from their bones, transforming skeletons into immortals, and regenerating to become human again. This is detailed in the Great Method.

These two chapters are the spirit within spirit, the treasure within treasure, the foremost of the Upper Grade. What the *Jade Dawn Dao Lord* received from the *Primordial Beginning* as the *Upper Scripture of Limitless Salvation of Humanity* is precisely this.

**Flowering Petals Chapter**
The immortal Dao values life, endlessly saving humanity. Above, it opens the Eight Gates and the Flying Heavenly Dharma Wheel. Sin and fortune have their prohibitions; karmic destinies have their causes and ends. Within the Eightfold Dharma Wheel’s gates lie the realms of sin and fortune, each with its prohibitions, and the traces of karmic destinies are fully recorded in the *Dharma Wheel Scripture*. Universally receiving liberation, the dead soul revives in a body. The body attains rebirth and ascends to be heard by the various heavens. Above the various heavens, each has its Gate of Life.

The *Authority Dao Diagram* states: The *Open Gate* is the human Dao, the *Qian* Palace, connecting to the *Crimson Palace* of Heaven. The *Rest Gate* is the Dao of the Śramaṇa, the *Kan* Palace, connecting to the *Hall of Brightness* of Heaven. The *Life Gate* is the immortal Dao, the *Gen* Palace, connecting to the *Jade Hall* of Heaven. These three gates are above the Three Heavens and are auspicious paths. Exiting through them brings fortune.

The *Death Gate* is the ghostly Dao, the *Kun* Palace, connecting to the qi of death. The *Closed Gate* is the karmic Dao, the *Xun* Palace, entering the Door of Death. The *Injury Gate* is the hellish Dao, the *Zhen* Palace. The *Alarm Gate* is the animal Dao, the *Dui* Palace. These two gates are the paths where the two qi intersect and divide. The *View Gate* is the spirit Dao, the *Li* Palace, at the place where the yang qi ends and perishes.

Now, these Eight Gates have both auspicious and inauspicious aspects. The inauspicious are the Doors of Death, while the auspicious are the Gates of Life. Thus, the scripture says: Above the various heavens, each has its Gate of Life. Even the inauspicious gates have auspicious paths leading to Heaven and rebirth.

The above main text was spoken by the *Primordial Heavenly Worthy* and recorded by the *Jade Dawn Dao Lord*.

**Three Realms Chapter**
Within are the *Empty Cavern Ballad* and the *Demon King’s Numinous Chapter*, their verses interwoven with the lofty perfected. This was recorded by the *Jade Dawn Dao Lord*.

**First: The Flying Air Melody of the Desire Realm**
The six heavens of the Desire Realm, from the *Royal Zeng* Heaven to the *Māra Barbarian* Heaven, contain a demon king named *Yumo*, who sings the *Flying Air Melody*. The Desire Realm occupies the lowest position, hence it is called the first.

The human Dao is distant and faint, the immortal Dao vast and boundless.
The ghostly Dao delights—ah!—in the human Gate of Life.
The heavenly Dao values life, the ghostly Dao values endings.
The immortal Dao is ever auspicious, the ghostly Dao ever inauspicious.
The lofty, pure, and numinous soar, chanting sorrowful songs in the great void.
I only wish the immortal Dao to succeed, not the human Dao to be exhausted.
The Northern Capital’s *Spring Curve* Prefecture holds a myriad ghostly hosts,
All desiring to cut short human destinies and sever the Gate of Life.
Ah, the singing of the *Cavern Chapter* to restrain the Northern *Fengdu*,
Binding and delivering demonic spirits, beheading and capturing at the Six Ghost Peaks.
*Xue Youqi* notes: Beheading means cutting off the head; capturing means severing the ears. On *Feng* Mountain are six peaks, each with a palace, hence the Six Ghost Peaks.

The names of the Six Palaces are found in the preceding chapter’s annotation on the Northern Capital’s *Luofeng*. Li Shaowei notes: It is written as *feng* (锋). The Six Heavens are demonic marauders. *Feng* signifies their vanguard. *Feng* means sharpness. While the qi of all heavens flows boundlessly, my Dao daily flourishes.

**Chapter on the Demon King of the Second Form Realm:**
From *Zi Yueheng* Heaven to *Tan Shi* Heaven, there are eighteen heavens in all, comprising the Form Realm, which lies above the Desire Realm—hence it is called the Second.

The demon king’s name is *Mara*. Lofty and vast, the twenty-eight constellations unfold. Their luminous qi shines in four directions, radiant as thus described. The Brahma-conduct heavens encircle the ten directions. This is the secret of the twenty-eight constellations, the method of *Yuan’gang*’s unfolding.

The primordial measure’s great spirits all arise from within my body. I possess the *Cavern Chapter*—reciting the *Cavern Chapter* follows the great method. The *Mysterious Master* states: Within the *Western Primordial Tortoise Mountain’s Primordial Record* is the *Cinnabar Sovereign’s Flying Mystery Purple Text Cavern Numinous Chapter*. That the demon king of the Form Realm declares, “I possess the *Cavern Chapter*,” refers precisely to this text.

**Cinnabar Sovereign’s Flying Mystery Purple Text Cavern Numinous Chapter**
The flying mystery’s purple qi congeals the numinous root. The method states: The flying mystery’s natural purple cloud qi is the primordial ancestral qi. The numinous root of the Heavenly Primordial is seen in the preceding *Yuan’gang* unfolding method.

The net of the Jade Void governs the myriad spirits. In the void, it surges and coalesces naturally—the flying mystery’s qi surges naturally, congealing within the Great Void. Above, twelve layered transmissions unfold. Jade towers towering, they gleam with luminous clouds. Flowing essence and purple gates gird golden portals. Jade halls resplendent, encircling the eight directions—the eight directions being the eight scenes.

Twelve-tiered towers of gold, nine-palace jade towers of the Three Fields, twelve spirit chambers. Above are halls of flowing essence and purple gates, golden radiance’s chambers, jade and jasper’s chambers, where the natural purple cloud qi appears, as seen in the preceding *Yuan’gang* unfolding method. Within dwell the nine numinous immortals of azure gold.

The cinnabar chamber’s true mother is named *Jingyan*. According to the great method, the Mysterious Master states: Within resides the lord of Brahma qi, the feminine One True Mother, as the nine numinous and supremely wondrous White Jade Tortoise Terrace. The Jade Radiance Golden Perfected Brahma Qi’s Ancestral Mother, the Azure Gold Cinnabar Sovereign Great Dao Lord. Also called the mother of the Lower Primordial’s Brahma qi, the spirit of *Heyan*.

Clad in flying azure feathers, her crown adorned with morning’s infant. Such is her attire. In hand she grasps a jade scepter and holds the numinous banner. The five-colored life-demon faces the imperial honored one. Visualize holding the five-colored life-demon treasure banner, ascending through the void to Jade Capital Mountain to pay homage to the Primordial Beginning. The *Secret Mantra of the Life-Demon from the Ancestral Altar’s Secret Instructions* records this in great detail; here, only an outline is given.

Grasping talismans and registers, she guards the Gate of Life. Holding talismans and registers preserves life’s root. Chewing the sun and moon, she drinks the sacred spring’s hum. She absorbs the sun and moon’s essence. Golden nectar and jade springs are seen in the preceding chapter’s annotation on the *Three Luminaries of Kai Ming*.

*Liluo* spits radiance to refine the five souls—this is the central ordering of the five qi. Within replete, without overflowing, the Crimson Palace rejoices. Within and without are ever obscure. The Crimson Palace is the heart. Golden light shines brilliantly, the form perfectly round—such is the symbol. From the new moon it enters the golden hue’s primordial chaos. *Shuo* is the north. The kidneys belong to the northern Water Palace. Gold is the west. The lungs belong to the western Metal Palace.

According to the *Yuan’gang* Unfolding Method*,* human primordial qi arises from the Hall of Brightness’s right kidney Gate of Life, belonging to the northwest *Qian* direction’s *Niutaiyuan* Palace. Yellow qi ascends into the heart. The heart belongs to the fiery Crimson Palace. Left-rotating, it flows behind the brain’s Jade Pillow Palace, circling the left eye’s Sun Palace. Right-rotating, it descends through the foot’s *Shaoyin* great toe, circulating the body, revolving around the right shoulder, entering the right eye’s Moon Palace. Then it traverses the five constants, flowing from the thirty-five sections of the spine into the lower cinnabar field’s left kidney Water Palace. It surges into the liver wood, passing through the central cinnabar field of the liver earth. Next, it moves through the lung’s Metal Palace, ascending the twelve-tiered tower of the throat, reaching the upper cinnabar field’s Mud Pill Palace and the fontanel’s Spirit Valley, ultimately emerging from the Upper Primordial.

Only the *Kai Ming* comprehends these words. The postscript of this scripture states: Those who attain the Dao shall thoroughly understand these profound words. On the fifth day of the fifth month, pay homage to the Northern Primordial.

Cultivate this Dao during the first, second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months. The fifth and ninth months are not for practice. In a year, ten months are counted, with five days each month—the third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and fifteenth—totaling five sessions per month. Purify and recite the *Flying Mystery Purple Text*. Inwardly visualize as prescribed, totaling five days per month, as noted afterward.

At once, behold the canopy-led immortal lord. Purple qi left-rotates, linking with the Dipper. Traversing the four and seven, the twenty-eight constellations enter the Golden Gate—this is the *Yuan’gang* unfolding method! Visualize within the Dipper’s *Hua Dong* the purple cloud qi, passing leftward through the Dipper’s stem, traversing the twenty-eight constellations, then returning above the Golden Gate, where one clicks the teeth and bows in the heart.

Precisely the Cinnabar Sovereign who examines the myriad immortals. Those who clearly understand this secret add diligence and movement, secretly reciting and inwardly contemplating, ever distinguishing its parts.

The *Wondrous Vision* converges with the essential scripture—after three years, one shall surely preserve eternal life. After nine years, riding the void with feathered skirts, clad in phoenix robes, one lightly soars to ascend Dragon Mountain. Bowing and rising, one pays homage to the Nine Numina and greets the Jade Dawn, thereby becoming a Great Perfected of the Numinous Treasure.

With both hands forming the Jade Clarity mudra, atop the head rests the Seven Stars Harmonious Crown of azure jade, robes of azure feathers and flying clouds, vermilion slippers and crimson skirts, girded with the divine sword of the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure, bearing the Five-Colored Round Symbol.

In cultivating this Dao, regularly practice during the first, second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months; the fifth and ninth months are excluded from practice. Each year totals ten months, with five sessions per month on the third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and fifteenth days.

Maintain purity, recite the *Flying Mystery Purple Text* once, and after midnight, stand exposed in the central courtyard. Gaze upward and visualize within the Dipper’s *Hua Gai* the purple cloud qi, left-rotating through the Dipper’s stem, traversing the twenty-eight constellations in full, then returning above the Golden Gate. If the sky is overcast and devoid of light, perform the visualization in silence within the chamber, ensuring each detail is distinct.

Upon completing the visualization, bow in the heart four times, click the teeth thrice, and raise the gaze to intone: *"The Celestial Court shines resplendent."* As the *Great Cavern Scripture* states: *"One inch within the brows lies the Hall of Light, three inches the Cinnabar Field, also called the Mud-Pill Palace. One inch above the Hall of Light lies the Celestial Court Palace."* The *Incantation of the Purple Tenuity Lady* says: *"Open the Celestial Court, that I may attain long life. The Mystic Valley—also called the Numinous Hall—awakens the true. The Mystic Valley’s Lower Origin is the Kidney Palace. The Numinous Void—according to the great method, the Inner Forbidden Numinous Void Palace of the Queen Mother of the Western Origin. Wandering clouds linger, the Four Golden Blossoms soar. The Middle Origin’s Golden Blossom. The Golden Blossom Palace shares a name with the Three Palaces of Dragon Mountain, the method of ascent and descent. The Cinnabar Sovereign spreads radiance, clouds fly with purple chariots. This evening, the Azure and Gold tally the immortals. Fulfill my supreme vow, may the body accord with spontaneity. Bind life to the Moon’s essence, preserve the root of years and days. The Three Numina merge with the vision—these are the Three Luminants of Kai Ming. Forever abide on Dragon Mountain. Secretly practice pure devotion, as herein proclaimed."*

Upon concluding the incantation, draw in the purple qi twenty-eight times and swallow it. Practicing this for three years, one will witness divine immortals descending upon their sleeping mat. The body will be enveloped in a radiant purple cloud, its form interwoven with luminous threads. Inscribed in the Nine Heavens’ register, after nine years, one shall attain the rank of Supreme Immortal.

This chapter is also named the *Great Incantation of the Golden Gate of Refinement and Transcendence*. Reciting it ten thousand times, one achieves immortality. According to the great method, recite it five times a month. Following the cavernous scriptures’ method, draw in the purple qi from the Dipper ten thousand times—this is called the *Outer Attendant’s Eightfold Jade Elixir*.

Reciting it one thousand times, divine light will appear and vanish at night. Two thousand times, the body will radiate light. Three thousand times, the entire chamber will be filled with light. Four thousand times, old ailments, new illnesses, lingering scars, and blemishes will all vanish, and one’s complexion will revert to that of an infant. Five thousand times, the Earthly Bureau will erase one’s name from the register of death, and the Jade Clarity will inscribe one in the ledger of the living, with a hundred spirits attending as guardians. Six thousand times, the entire body will emit light, illuminating a hundred paces, allowing one to read fine script at night. Ghosts and spirits will no longer remain hidden, and one will foresee what is yet to come. Seven thousand times, one’s breath will revive all things, even raising the dead. Eight thousand times, exhaling upon the five metals will transform them into supreme treasures, their light forming perfect spheres. Nine thousand times, the elixir will ripen like the sun, the face will take on a golden countenance, the bones will become refined and fragrant, and the Three Heavens will record one as an immortal. Ten thousand times, the Dao will be perfected, and one will be ordained as a Perfected One.

The immortal path values transcendence, while the ghostly path clings to attachment. Heaven and earth stretch vast and boundless, yet impure qi swirls thickly. The Three Realms offer joy—surpass them and abide forever. Transcend this realm, and the body merges with spontaneity. Merging with spontaneity is the attainment of the Great Cavern. At this moment, joy is but a trifle of my grace. The Dragon Han era stretches endlessly—how can one distinguish the true? My realm is difficult to transcend, thus I compose this cavernous scripture. Soaring through the void in transformation, I test your resolve. Success or failure, slackening or retreat—how few are those who transcend! Laughing at those who fail to cross, I thus sing this song.

The *Song of the Third Formless Realm’s Demon King* states:
From the Radiant Court’s dawn, ascending through the heavens to the Exalted Joy Forbidden Heaven, lies the Four Heavens of the Formless Realm. As it resides above the Form Realm, it is called the Third. The Demon King’s name is Shao.

Above the Three Realms stretches the vast and distant Great Luo. Beyond the roots of form, clouds tower in layers. Only the Primordial Beginning dwells in the household of the vast kalpas. Governing my realm, I receive command from the Mystic Capital. Those who transgress my realm enter the Jade Void. Entering the Jade Void is the attainment of the Great Cavern and the realization of immortality as a Perfected One. I, the Supreme King, govern and restrain the myriad demons. Amidst the ten thousand transformations of the void, impure qi blooms in profusion. Few preserve their authenticity; many are deluded and confused. The immortal path is difficult to uphold; the ghostly path easily strays into depravity. The human path lies in the heart—truly, it does not depend on others. The immortal path values substance; the human path values splendor. If you do not delight in the immortal path, how can you pass through the Three Realms? Should you wish to traverse the Five Paths, what can I do for you?

The *Songs of the Three Realms* were composed by the Demon King, transcribed by the August One, and recorded by the Dao Lord—these are not the two chapters. Above the Three Realms, in the midst of soaring through the void, the Demon King’s song resonates, its melody harmonizing with the cavernous scriptures. Reciting it a hundred times is called *Transcending the Southern Palace*. A thousand times, the Demon King will protect and welcome you. Ten thousand times, the Dao will be perfected, and you will ascend into the Great Void, transcending the Three Realms to attain the rank of Immortal Duke.

The Mystic Master says: This refers to reciting the *Song of the Three Realms’ Demon King*—it is not the two chapters.

**The Reverent Form Chapter**
Hearing the numinous sound, the Demon King reveres the form. The *Xū* script commands the earthly deities. Upon receiving refinement and rebirth, the thirty-two characters of the *Xū* script command the earthly deities. Written in black, it instructs the local earth gods to reverently welcome the scholar reciting the scripture.

**Attending Guardians for Escort**
So-and-so, extricated from the earthly prison, freed from the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, with seven generations of ancestors ascending, forever departing the ghostly bureaus. The soul crosses the Vermilion Mound, receiving refinement and rebirth. The *Xū* script is invoked.

The Mystic Master says: With sincerity in heart and form, those who listen attentively to the recitation will attain the nine grades of virtuous fruition.

The *Xū* script was bestowed by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin, and recorded by the Jade Clarity Dao Lord. It is called boundless, universally delivering the infinite. It is a secret celestial script, revered by all heavens. To leak or slight it is to fall into the earthly peaks, bringing calamity upon seven generations of ancestors.

**The Heavenly Verity Chapter**
The Dao states: These two chapters—
According to the great method, the Mystic Master says: The first chapter, from the *Primordial Cavernous Numinous Treasure’s Original Chapter* to *Arrayed Words of the Highest Clarity*, is the first chapter. The second chapter, from the *Primordial Cavernous Jade Calendar* to *Verses Harmonizing with the Lofty Perfected*, is the second chapter. The *Songs of the Three Realms* are not these two chapters but are solely the compositions of the Demon King.

All are the hidden sounds of the myriad heavens’ Celestial Thearchs and the numinous demon kings, all in the language of the Great Brahma, not the common speech of the mundane world. Their words lack ornate rhythm; their melodies lack florid embellishment. Thus, they are called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail. Treasured by the heavens, they are secreted in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace of the Mystic Capital. According to the mystic statutes, they are transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. If a perfected one offers gold and treasures, pledges sincerity, and follows the ancient protocols to swear oaths before the Ten Heavens, only then are they bestowed. The protocols for transmission and reception are established by the celestial statutes of forty thousand kalpas—these are the ancient kalpa’s regulations.

The Ten Heavens are: the Nine Qi Azure Heaven of the East, the Three Qi Cinnabar Heaven of the South, the Seven Qi White Heaven of the West, the Five Qi Mystic Heaven of the North, the Four Brahma Qi Heavens of the Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest, the One Qi Vast Heaven above, and the Twelve Qi August Heaven below. Swearing oaths before the Ten Heavens involves inscribing the great contract in vermilion, facing the Ten Heavens to divide it.

Thus concludes the third scroll of the *Primordial Beginning’s Scripture of the Upper Chapters on the Limitless Salvation of Humanity*.
The fourth scroll of the *Primordial Beginning’s Scripture of the Upper Chapters on the Limitless Salvation of Humanity* begins.

The *Register of the Three and Five Offices of the Most High*, Compiled and Annotated by Disciple Chen Chunrong of the Daoist Registers for Universal Salvation

The Salvation Chapter

The Dao speaks: The revolutions of Heaven and Earth also have their ends of adversity. "Revolutions" refers to kalpic cycles; "revolutions" denotes their reckoning. Cheng Xuanying annotates: "Ends of adversity" means the *yang* nine and hundred-six. "End" signifies the dissolution of the Three Realms. The *yang* nine and hundred-six: according to the *Book of Changes*, nineteen years form one *zhang*, four *zhang* form one *bu*, twenty *bu* form one *tong*, and three *tong* form one *yuan*, totaling four thousand six hundred twenty years in one *yuan*, during which fifty-four years of flood and drought occur. The *yang* nine: *yang* numbers are odd, culminating in nine; when calamities strike, the greatest is a nine-year drought. Lesser manifestations include seven, five, three, or one year of fire. *Yin* numbers are even, culminating in eight; when calamities strike, they bring eight, six, four, or two years of flood. At the onset of a *yuan*, after one hundred sixty years—an odd *yang* number—minor droughts occur, hence the term "hundred-six calamity." Broadly speaking, the conjunction of *yang* nine and hundred-six: at the onset of a *yuan*, three hundred years mark the lesser *yang* nine and lesser hundred-six, while nine hundred years mark the greater *yang* nine and greater hundred-six. The greater calamities entail nine years of severe drought and eight years of great flood. The *Book of Han* states: four thousand six hundred seventeen years constitute one *yuan*, and the completion of three *yuan* marks the end of a great kalpa, when Heaven and Earth dissolve. Three *yuan* together span thirteen thousand eight hundred fifty-one years. At the onset of a *yuan*, one hundred sixty years bring minor calamities, thus the meaning of the "end of adversity in the hundred-six" is briefly outlined as above.

The sun, moon, and five planets also wax and wane. Even the most sagely and divine beings experience prosperity and decline. Lesser scholars, too, suffer illness and injury.

When such calamities arise, all who share the same *qi* must unite in sincere purification rites, perform incense offerings through the six periods, and recite the scriptures ten times over—whereupon virtue and power descend at once, dissolving all inauspicious omens. The boundless scriptures universally deliver limitless beings.

The Perfected Master states: The six periods are midnight, dawn, mealtime, noon, afternoon, and dusk—these are the six *yang* hours.

**Yin Refinement Chapter**
The Dao declares: When lesser learners of the Way possess shallow attainment or their immortal rank remains unfulfilled, and their destined time of dissolution arrives, their bodies pass through the Great Yin. At the moment of transition, fellow students and perfected beings should perform incense offerings and recite the scriptures ten times to deliver the corporeal form according to the proper method. Following the Five Refinements for Reviving the Corpse, they deliver the form, and this method of refining and delivering the corpse derives from the *Nine Refinements for Generative Transformation* chapter of the *Scripture of the Five Refinements for Reviving the Corpse*. The hun-soul then ascends directly to the Southern Palace, where, based on the merit of their practice, they are reborn after a calculated number of days. Escaping the wheel of rebirth, they attain immortality.

**Preservation and Pacification Chapter**
The Dao declares: When the cycles of Heaven and Earth reach their end, one must perform purification rites—specifically, the *Golden Register Retreat of the Numinous Treasure*. Offer incense and recite the scriptures. When the stellar lodges fall into disorder and the sun and moon lose their proper course, one must perform purification rites—specifically, the *Nine Luminaries Retreat of the Heavenly Sovereign*. Offer incense and recite the scriptures. When the four seasons lose their balance and *yin* and *yang* fall into disharmony, one must perform purification rites—specifically, the *Five Emperors’ Nurturing Life Retreat*. Offer incense and recite the scriptures. To pray for rain or clear skies, perform the *Five Divine Retreat of the Abyssal Mystery*. When the ruler of the state faces calamity and warfare erupts on all sides, one must perform purification rites—specifically, the *Supreme One Sacred Perfected Retreat*. Offer incense and recite the scriptures. When pestilence spreads and the people suffer death and injury, one must perform purification rites—specifically, the *Longevity and Life-Preservation Retreat*. Offer incense and recite the scriptures. When a teacher or companion passes away, one must perform purification rites—specifically, the *Yellow Register Retreat of the Numinous Treasure*. Offer incense and recite the scriptures.

The Perfected Master states: The established rites for these retreats are all prescribed by the worldly regulations. These six principles constitute the essential methods of practice and merit for scholars of the Way. Whenever the Dao encounters any adversity, one should perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite the scriptures—thereby assuredly attaining the rank of Perfected Being, becoming a minister of the Golden Towers. For details, consult the Great Methods.

The merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is profound: above, it dissolves celestial calamities and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poisonous harms and delivers the people. From life to death, all rely upon it, and its blessings are immeasurable—thus it is called the boundless universal deliverance of heaven and humanity. One should silently cultivate a heart of compassion, universally extending it to all, resolving calamities and alleviating hardships, thereby accumulating hidden virtuous merit.

**Utmost Words Chapter**
The Dao declares: Whoever possesses these scriptures and performs such meritorious deeds for Heaven, Earth, the emperor, and the people—on the day of calamity, if they resolve to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times—all the heavens will record their names, and the myriad spirits will attend and protect them. Those who perform these rites and recitations will obtain the three grades of good fruits. The most distinguished among them will become ministers of the Sacred Lord in the Golden Towers. The heavens record their merits and transgressions with perfect precision, down to the finest detail. The demon kings of heaven will also advocate for their persons. Those who attain the Way will thoroughly comprehend these utmost words.

When reciting this scripture, one should complete ten full cycles, embodying the intent of the Primordial Beginning’s revolving discourse. Until the profound meanings within the scripture are fully grasped, one must not grow lax or abandon their resolve. After the merit is fulfilled, the mind’s repository becomes empty and still, free from the defilements of the worldly dust, and the true purport naturally becomes clear.

From the Dao’s discourse in these two chapters to the thorough comprehension of the utmost words, this is the postscript of the Supreme Jade Clarity Great Dao Lord.

**Great Cavern Chapter**
The Boundless Sounds of the Great Brahma Hidden Language in the Heavens—this is the title.

Yan Dong states: There are four types of concealment: concealment of names, concealment of taboos, concealment of matters, and concealment of language.

Li Shaowei states: According to the *Scripture of Inner Sounds*, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, seated in the Cypress Mound of the Vermilion Brightness World, was enveloped in clouds and mist for three days and nights, during which the mysterious *yin* did not disperse. The Five Elders addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Today, while attending your seat, we have witnessed what we have never seen before." When the Heavenly Worthy expounds the teachings, rivers and seas fall silent, and mountains and peaks conceal their mists. Yet today, the daylight is overcast, and the heavenly and human realms are filled with dread—we know not the reason.

The Heavenly Worthy replied: Today, the heavens have manifested auspicious signs, and numinous responses arise spontaneously. The jade characters radiate brilliance, obscuring the light of heaven, compelling all present to close their eyes and listen reverently. In an instant, the celestial *qi* surged forth, the darkness dissipated, and five-colored light illuminated the ten directions. Suddenly, a divine scripture, each character a *zhang* in size, appeared in the void above, its radiant patterns dazzling, with eight corners emitting rays of light so intense that none could gaze upon it.

The Heavenly Worthy proclaimed to all: This divine scripture of the Eight Assemblies has no fixed form; its meaning is profound and subtle, difficult to fathom. It should be annotated and explained. Thereupon, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign received the Heavenly Worthy’s luminous command, annotating its sounds and dividing its measures. The thirty-two heavens each received eight characters, collectively forming the *Flying Mystery Natural Script*. Combining the *qi* of the Five Directions’ Flying Mystery with the sounds of the eight characters, it is called the *Boundless Great Brahma Hidden Language Cavern Chapter*.

Composed by the Dao Lord
The Supreme Jade Clarity Great Dao Lord, as the master of the Numinous Treasure teachings, compiled this middle section of the thirty-two heavenly jade characters into the *Scripture of Cloud Seal Luminous Chapters*.

**Middle Section of the Primordial Numinous Scripture**
This is the Dao Lord’s self-designation beneath the title. These are the sounds of the Great Brahma Hidden Language.

The middle section of the Great Methods consists of the inner sounds of the thirty-two heavenly Great Brahma jade characters. The purport of the boundless hidden language is the *Forbidden Chapter of the Primordial Ancestral Qi Numinous Scripture*. Composed by the Jade Clarity Dao Lord and transcribed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, it conceals within it the secret taboos of the Great Cavern and the principles of the Five Kalpas’ unfolding diagrams. In total, there are two hundred fifty-six characters, distributed among the thirty-two heavens, with eight characters per heaven. Internally, it follows the eight trigrams—*Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Gen*, *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*—and their sixty-four transformations, with each phrase corresponding to one hexagram.

The text spans the sixty cyclical years of *jiazi*, with the four hexagrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* emerging beyond the bounds of the six *jia* stems, unbound by the limits of the *jiazi* cycle.

Li Shaowei states: In the present commentary, I follow the inner sounds and glosses of the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, sometimes condensing for essentials, sometimes adding characters for clarity, and rearranging the scriptural text. Where I do not adhere to the sequential order, it is to enable swift comprehension of the meaning.

*Liú* is the flowing light of dawn, illuminating the long-night abyss.
*Xuán* is emptiness. Above the Yueheng Heaven lies the Xuan Capital’s radiance, where the Hollow Peak Mountain stands—a realm where myriad sages wander and the living and dead return.

Ātuó Lóngluó, Four Symbols and Xuyuan.

These eight characters are the inner sounds of the Mengyi Heaven.

*Ā* refers to the nine-fold mountain at the center of heaven, linked by ridges and cypress groves.

The Thearch often rides the Three Simplicities’ clouds, roaming the peaks of Ā Hill above and overseeing the sins of all beings below.
*Lóng* is Dragon Mountain, separated from Ātuó by ninety million miles.
*Luó* are the names of the sun and moon. The *Jade Weft* states that the Perfected of the Nine Heavens of Upper Purity call the sun "Zhuoyao Luo." It speaks of mountains interlocking, where the sun and moon shine upon the peaks.
*Sì* are the Four Poles Palaces: Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, and Northern Perfection. The Perfected of the Four Poles govern the registers of life and death.
*Xiàng* is the Elephant Wheel chariot. The Perfected often ride these carriages, traversing the Three Realms to audit the records of life, death, and sins, and to deliver those who cultivate the Dao.
*Xū* is the taboo name of the Xuyu Heavenly Thearch, who serves as the Lord of Life-Deliverance in the Southern Palace, refining and delivering decayed remains.

The Four Poles will bestow upon them natural feathered chariots, and their seven ancestors will rejoice in the Hall of Blessings.

Upon completion of recitation, knock the teeth nine times and visualize the ninefold numinous qi, the azure-jade radiance, arriving from the Eastern Limitless Mystery. After a long while, softly recite the prayer of the Jade Dawn Lord.

The prayer of the Jade Dawn Lord of the Eight Heavens of the Eastern Limitless Sound:
Vast and boundless, linked to the Flowery Gates,
Divine and honored, the True One of the Thearch’s Unity.
Spiritual emptiness intermingles with sun and moon,
Mysterious awakening illumines the dark ford.
The Jade Pass revolves the reckoning of fate,
Brahman qi unfolds the capital’s brilliance.
Banners wave, resounding the cavernous chant,
Heavenly Lords grasp the wheel of transformation.
Golden Florescence receives the immortal register,
Lushly girded at the Dragon Mountain Palace.
Treasure and splendor gleam with wondrous radiance,
Feasting and play in the lofty upper walls.
Misty vapors scatter in subtle mists,
Refining essence to nurture my form.
Soaring heavens observe the kalpic assembly,
Praising and chanting the texts of the Origin Beginning.
The Supreme Ultimate establishes the Azure Key,
Dawn’s radiance spreads forth generation.
Bright and luminous, responding to the vaulted heavens,
Joyful and serene, abiding in the Jade Infant.
The August Nurturer revolves the chariot of light,
Ascending and delivering the souls of the seven ancestors.
The vast model flows through the flying net,
Encompassing the roots of heaven and earth.
Auspicious clouds veil the towering skies,
Purple Palaces of the Perfected Lords.
Resplendent in the Azure Mystery’s precincts,
Eradicating trials and crushing evil and malice.
The Dao responds to the primordial vastness,
Spirit congeals in the Niwan’s essence.
The Spirit Mound’s Three Simplicities’ clouds,
Interweaving radiance upon the Jasper Peaks.
Seven and nine unite in function,
Three and five merge in shared merit.
Together harmonizing the virtue of equilibrium,
Transforming and refining to transcend the immortal lineage.

After the prayer, visualize the ninefold numinous qi of the preceding, nine layers of azure clouds enveloping the body. Nine-hued mysterious dragons attend left and right, and the secret incantation says:
Vermilion brightness unfolds the chart,
Eight qi return to the True.
Governing the Origin Pass,
Azure Thearch, great spirit.
Flowing transformation beyond the nine,
Entwining my body.
Numinous sounds of eight scriptures,
Sixty-four chapters.
Penetrating heaven and earth,
Uniting with me as immortal.
Wielding the dragon chariot’s governance,
Ascending to the Thearch’s yoke.

After the incantation, guide the preceding ninefold numinous qi and swallow it nine times. Blend and harmonize the five viscera until they gleam like lapis lazuli. Practicing this for nine years, one attains the essence of the nine azure sprouts, the body emanating luminosity, penetratingly perceiving the void. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is perfected, and one gains the ability to fly. The seven ancestors share in the blessing, all ascending to the Southern Palace.

The Three Qi of the Southern Cinnabar Heaven’s Natural Jade Script:
Nányán Dòngfú, Xinmao.
Jade Eyes Discourse.
Rénchén Sìwén.
These eight characters are the inner sounds of the Heyang Heaven.

*Nányán* refers to the Southern Flowing Fire Court, its flying flames blazing across the eight directions.
*Dòngfú* describes the qi of the Cavernous Yang Palace, blazing and floating.
*Jade Eyes* means that refining the body with the flowing fire’s essence generates jade radiance, bright as pupils—hence, Jade Eyes. All who first attain the Dao journey to the Flowing Fire Court, where the Southern Culmen Perfected washes and refines them with fire-essence, scouring away dust and grime, allowing them to become companions of the Perfected. Thus, flourishing and abundant.

The Dharma-Form Descends from Emptiness, *Guǐsì*.
The Nine Numinous Ones Advance, *Jiǎwǔ Chénwén*.
These eight characters are the inner sounds of the Reverent Splendor Heaven.

*Dharma-Form* refers to the title of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy during the Dragon Han era. By the Red Clarity epoch, he was called the Nameless Lord; when the Highest Sovereign inaugurated the kalpa, he was known as the Primordial Venerable. The Dharma-qi transforms his form, manifesting through kalpas with a single spirit, unborn of womb—hence, *Dharma-Form*. *Descends from Emptiness* means the Primordial One arises from the void.

*The Nine Numinous Ones* are the Nine Radiant Perfected. They govern within the Southern Highest Palace, presiding over the nocturnal destinies of the dead in the Nine Glooms. *Advance* signifies that the Nine Radiant Perfected, keepers of the Register of Lives, calculate the past-life virtues of the dead. Those with meritorious deeds receive the talismans of life-extension from the Four Dipper Perfected, who bestow them to deliver the dead from the Nine Glooms.

The Marsh of Jade Brilliance, *Yǐwèi*.
The Verdant Net of the Great Thousand, *Bǐngshēn Zhōngzhǐ Shàngwén*.
These eight characters are the inner sounds of the Ancestral Whirlwind Heaven.

*The Marsh* is the cavernous hollow within the Mountain of Heaven. Atop this mountain lies the grotto of the myriad dragons, containing the Yellow Chamber—also called the Jade Countenance Hall. *Brilliance* is the esoteric name of the Jade Dawn Dao Lord, who governs within the Yellow Chamber, enduring the great kalpa without end and shining anew through the Dragon Han, thus delighting in the profound.

*The Perfected* is the hidden title of the Flying Heavenly Perfected, of whom there are countless. *The Terrace* is the Jade Terrace, situated on the southern face of the Marsh Mountain. *The Verdant Net* refers to the Lady of the Moon, whose name is Luo Ying. Her countenance is like jade, and she wears a green mantle and azure robes—hence, *Verdant Net*. She ascends the Great Net Heaven, embodying the qi of the Dharma-conduct, presiding over the gateway of kalpic transformation in accord with the reckonings of Heaven and Earth, culminating at the great kalpa. Having received the conjunction of sun and moon, she convenes upon the Jade Terrace.

The *Great Thousand* denotes the reckoning of worlds. Master Lu states: counting a thousand to a thousand yields a *Lesser Thousand*; counting a thousand Lesser Thousands yields a *Middle Thousand*; counting a thousand Middle Thousands yields a *Great Thousand*. Thus, it is called the *Great Thousand*. Those who recite and chant the Cavernous Chapters may ride the feathered-wheel chariot, ascend the chamber of the Yellow Chamber, wander above the Jade Terrace, and behold the realm of the Great Thousand.

*Miao-mang of the Nine Uglies*, *Ding-you*. *Shao-yao Yuan-zhan*. *Wu-xu Wu-wen*.
These eight characters are the celestial sounds of the *August Reed-Pipe Heaven*. *Miao* refers to the jade script of the celestial writ, submerged within the *Yan-kang* era, obscured and unmanifest—dim and distant. *Mang* signifies the opening of the *Dragon Han* kalpa, wherein its script shines anew—vast and boundless. Should one encounter its Way, both men and women shall live for thirty-six thousand years. At the culmination of this kalpa, it endures another kalpic cycle, and the nine *qi* each give rise to a beast to harm the wicked. Once the kalpa unfolds, these nine beasts are called the *Nine Ugly Ghosts*. The *Northern Thearch’s Supreme Perfected* presides over the *Register of Life and Death*, thus establishing the *Nine Uglies* to assist the *Three Officials*. When the reckoning reaches eighty-one myriad degrees, at the convergence of celestial *qi*, the *Nine Uglies* are to be aided, and they are titled the *Envoys of the Nine Capitals*.

*Shao* is the hidden name of the *Celestial Reed-Pipe Heavenly Deity*, the *Cloud Sovereign*. The *Cloud Sovereign* is the spirit of the *Demon King*, who constantly tests whether the cultivators of the Dao are upright or not. The *Demon King* composes ballads to disturb the human heart; those whose hearts remain steadfast are protected and recommended by the king, ascending directly into the *August Reed-Pipe Heaven*. *Yuan-zhan* is the hidden name of the *Northern and Southern Dipper Lords*. When one’s meritorious deeds are recorded by the *Southern Dipper*, the *Southern Dipper* delivers them from the trials of the *Three Realms* and the sufferings of the *Nine Darks*, notifying the *Demon King* below, who dares not harm them. If one commits evil, the *Three Officials* record their sins before the *Northern Dipper*, and the *Northern Dipper* commands the *Demon King* to annihilate their souls, consigning them to the depths of the *Nine Darks* to serve in the eternal night’s labor.

The *August Reed-Pipe Heaven* contains the *Mountain of Golden Splendor*. Those who cultivate and attain the Dao all journey to this mountain to receive the *Taiyi’s* trust, thereby controlling and vanquishing demonic trials. Only then may they ride the *radiance-wheel chariot* and roam the eight directions in revelry.

The *Nine Qi* are expounded in the *Scripture of the Orthodox Dao of the Three Heavens*: the *Primordial Qi* generates three *qi*—the first is *Crimson Cavern*, the second is *White Luminance*, and the third is *Azure Vastness*. The *Original Qi* generates three *qi*—the first is *Verdant Flame*, the second is *Yellow Radiance*, and the third is *Dark Chaos*. It is further said: the *Mysterious Qi of White Concealment* generates three *qi*—the first is *Purple Fusion*, the second is *Jade Blaze*, and the third is *Black Flow*. These are called the *Nine Qi*.

*Cloud Above the Nine Capitals*, *Ji-hai*. *Flying Life from Self-Exaltation*. *Geng-zi Wei-wen*.
These eight characters are the celestial sounds of the *Hall Radiance Heaven*. *Cloud Above* is the hidden name of the *Flying Heavenly Deity-King*. It inaugurates the *Dragon Han* kalpa, initiates the *Vermilion Brightness* kalpic cycle, enumerates the script of natural reckoning, and establishes the roots of Heaven and Earth. The *Nine Capitals* refer to the nine-tiered terrace that emerges once the *Three Images* divide, situated upon the *Jade Capital Mountain*, resplendent above the *Empty Mystery*. The *Flying Heavenly Perfected* constantly scatter the fragrance of *hundred-fold harmony* and disperse the blossoms of the *five clouds* to observe the *Flying Heavenly Perfected*. Upon the terrace stands the *Supreme Perfected Jade Youth*, who thrice daily waves the *Ten Absolute Banners*, whereupon the *Celestial Thearchs of the Myriad Heavens* thrice pay homage to the *Mysterious Terrace*, reciting and chanting the *Cavernous Chapters*.

*Flying Life* is the name of the *Divine Spirit of Southern Renewal*. When scholars recite the *Cavernous Chapters*, the myriad heavens rejoice, and *Flying Life* opens the path of immortality, streaming the *qi* of eternal life. Refining the *Five Hun* below, the *Eight Radiant Ones* are preserved within. *Self* means *from*. *Exaltation* refers to the *Forest of Exaltation*. Once the heart is united in lifting one to ascend the *Nine-Tiered Mysterious Terrace*, dwelling beneath the *Forest of Exaltation*, girded with the *Celestial Writ* and reciting the *Cavernous Chapters* with the mouth, one may ascend to pay homage at the *Palace of the Mysterious Capital*.

At the first intonation of *Yu-fu*, the *Demon King* binds his form. Scholars who comprehend the *qi* of the four seasons and the *ten cycles* of the *Celestial Gate* may enter the *Dharma-Wheel’s* portal, ride the *Eight Radiant Ones’* chariot, ascend to chant within the *Jade Clarity*, and pay homage at the *Purple Tenuity’s* terrace.

If one’s spirit-king bears this title, it opens the *Long Night’s* repository, retrieves the *Nine Dark’s* souls, and delivers them through the *Three Realms’* gate. *Yun-rong* is the right attendant of the *Mysterious Harmony Jade Maiden*. Once one is delivered through the *Three Realms’* gate, *Yun-rong* guides them with the *Vermilion Spirit’s qi*, infusing their form, and with the *Grand Harmony’s* essence, irrigating their spirit, ascending to the *Hall of Blessing and Virtue*, and preserving the *kalpa’s* endless continuity.

Sever forever the roots of evil.
Together rejoice in the feast of fortune,
Receiving blessings by nature’s grace.
For kalpas unbound, liberation dawns,
Abiding eternally with destiny’s flow."*

After the incantation, draw in the sevenfold wondrous qi of the Seven Spirits seven times, merging it with the five viscera until they gleam like moonlight’s crystal hue. Practicing this for seven years, one attains the essence of the Sevenfold Qi of Great Simplicity, halting the years to remain in the world, preserving youth for ten thousand kalpas. Blessings extend to the seven ancestors, who ascend to the Southern Palace, reborn through the womb to be immortal in every life.

**Northern Quintessence: The Mysterious Heaven’s Spontaneous Jade Glyphs**
*Ju-Wu Zi-Yu, Gui-Hai. Nine Days Guide Qian. Hai-Wen.*

These eight characters are the celestial sounds of the Xiaodu Heaven.
*Ju-Wu* was a flying immortal of the Dragon Han era. From the primordial qi of the Original Beginning—amidst the formless, boundless darkness—*Ju-Wu* emerged, borne by destiny, coalescing into being. Once the Xiaodu Heaven was established, it endured through endless kalpas. *Yu* is the inner name of the Xiaodu Heavenly King. *Nine* signifies the Heavenly King riding the elephant-wheel chariot, traversing the Nine Mysteries’ gates, turning the Nine Mechanisms’ degrees, aligning with the kalpa’s appointed time. *Day* refers to the Solar Youth at heaven’s center. *Guide* means to lead and harmonize qi. At the world’s end, the Solar Youth halts its light to deliver practitioners, anointing them with the Water Mother’s essence, guiding them with the Great Harmony’s qi, refining the five spirits, and ushering them into the Vermilion Palace—hence, *Guide Qian*.

**Earth Mother Eastward Veils,**
*Form Gathers the Supreme Mystery.*
*Jia-Zi Xu-Wen*

These eight characters are the celestial sounds of the Yuan Dong Heaven.
The *Earth Mother* is the sovereign of the Great Yin’s domain, mother of the Nine Spirits. She governs the Eastern Sea’s Fusang Yang Valley’s abyss, ever mastering earth’s mechanisms, turning the wheel of primordial qi, responding to the Heavenly Gate above. When the Heavenly Gate turns and the Earth’s axis moves, the heavens complete one revolution, and the waters surge three thousand three hundred times. As heaven and earth’s qi intertwine, the Nine Seas darken, and a single water inundates the sky. *East* signifies the Eastern Sea’s convergence, regulating the river’s source. *Tread* refers to the water spirit. Dwelling upon Kunlun Mountain, she stabilizes the vast sea, damming the Eastern Well to prevent the earth’s mechanisms from sinking, preserving the kalpa’s longevity. *Form Gathers* describes the moment of calamity’s convergence, when the Earth Mother’s form emerges above the Eastern River, summoning the Bird Mother to welcome the aspiring immortal with a phoenix chariot, ascending to Kunlun’s ruins. The *Bird Mother* is the water’s sentinel spirit. *Above* signifies the Earth Mother’s ascent to the Imperial Lord, reporting the kalpa’s appointed time, delivering the aspiring immortal, and inscribing their name in the Mystic Capital’s palace.

**Tuo-Luo Yu-Miao, Yi-Chou. Slight Qi Harmonizes Clouds.**
*Bing-Yin Si-Zhi Zhong-Wen*

These eight characters are the celestial sounds of the Miaocheng Heaven.
*Tuo* is the inner name of the Heavenly Emperor, born alongside Miaocheng upon the Cloud Ridge. *Luo* is the name of the moon at its first crescent. *Tuo* dwells upon the Cloud Ridge, cradling the moon to shine. *Yu* is the Heavenly King of Miaocheng, named *Yusheng*, governing the ten directions’ flying immortals. *Miao* is the Heavenly Feathered Forest’s supervising spirit, named *Divine King*. He constantly oversees the Three Realms, reviewing the ledgers of life and death, commanding demon kings to safeguard those who attain the Dao. *Slight* signifies the vast and distant. When one attains deliverance, they ascend to the Feathered Forest to receive talismans, journeying through the cloud palaces in boundless flight. *Qi* refers to cloud qi. *Harmonizes* means to merge with the radiance. Having entered the Feathered Forest, they weave cloud qi into robes, soaring to the Vermilion Palace to receive the Heavenly Court’s blessings, then ascending with all heavens, merging with the light.

---

**Flying Immortal Great Chou, Ding-Mao. Oversees the Upper Heavens.**
*Wu-Chen Zi-Wen*

These eight characters are the celestial sounds of the Jin Shang Heaven.
The *Flying Immortal* is the Flying Immortal Divine King. In heaven, the flying mystery’s qi coalesces into the *Hollow Scripture*, recited by the ten directions’ divine kings upon the empty firmament to harmonize with nature’s qi, guiding those who cultivate the Dao. *Great* is the registrar of the Three Realms, governing the charts of life and death. *Chou* is the elder, the demon king of the Three Realms, serving under *Great Chou*. When practitioners recognize this sound, demon kings protect their true forms, ascending the Three Clarities. *Oversees* is the office of the Flying Immortals’ commander, ever gathering the eight assemblies’ qi to hasten heaven and earth’s revolutions, supervising the eternal night’s officials, liberating the Nine Dark Realms’ souls. When practitioners know the celestial sounds, heavenly demons submit, *Great Chou* commands the immortal ranks, and they ascend to heaven’s center.

---

**Sha-Tuo Kalpa-Measure, Ji-Si. Dragon Han’s Radiant Freshness.**
*Geng-Wu Chou-Wen*

These eight characters are the celestial sounds of the Changrong Heaven.
*Sha* refers to the *Shalan Palace* in heaven, a detached hall of the Purple Tenuity, nestled above the Jade Clarity, resplendent within the Purple Void. *Tuo* is *Tuoqiu*, where multitudes—tens of thousands of newly delivered immortals—reside. Their merits incomplete, they linger there. *Kalpa-Measure* signifies that at each kalpa’s turning, the multitudes of *Tuoqiu* are assessed by their merits’ measure, ascending to the Vermilion Mound Palace to receive blessings and immortality. *Dragon Han* is the name of the first kalpa, when the Great Dao was pure and simple, its transformations effortless, difficult to corrupt. *Ying* was a flying immortal guest of the Dragon Han era, constantly liberating the Nine Dark Realms’ souls to ascend within the Lan Palace. *Fresh* refers to the Southern Palace’s youth. When practitioners attain deliverance, the *Fresh Youth* refines their appearance upon the Vermilion Mound.

Within the Azure Vault floats *Fuli*,
*"Xinwei, Kongge, Baozhen."*
*"Renshen, Yinwen"*—these eight characters are the celestial sounds of Jade Clarity Heaven.
In Jade Clarity Heaven, azure mists of *qi* ever arise.
*Luo* is the name of a Flying Heavenly Divine King.
Riding a chariot of azure mist, he roams Jade Clarity Heaven,
thrice daily leading the host of celestial sages to ascend and attend court at the Seven Treasures Palace.
*Fuli* is the inner name of the Heavenly King.
As the host of sages attends court, the Heavenly King proclaims jubilation.
*Kong* is the name of the celestial attendant of dawn.
*Ge* refers to the cavernous hymns—when the attendant of dawn utters a cry,
a numinous wind arises, and the sound forms the cavernous hymns, hence *"Kongge."*
*Baozhen* signifies that when practitioners comprehend the sound of these eight characters,
they ascend to the Southern Palace, becoming guests of the Flying Heavenly Ones,
preserving themselves through this unending kalpa,
cherishing the natural scripture, hence *"Baozhen."*

*"Wuyi, Wupin,"*
*"Guiyou, Dongmiao, Zizhen."*
*"Jiaxu, Maowen"*—these eight characters are the celestial sounds of Brahma-Passage Heaven.
*Wuyi* is the inner name of the Heavenly King.
Long ago, during the Dragon Han kalpa,
when all karmic conditions were exhausted, he transcended the Three Realms’ courts,
ascending into the Great Void’s halls to receive the register of the Nine Immortals
and assume the title of Great Sage.
When the Red Clarity kalpa dawned, the Primordial Beginning bestowed upon him the kingship of Brahma-Passage Heaven.
*Wu* is the Supreme Nonbeing Perfected.
Receiving the Heavenly King’s talisman, he delivers the souls of the Long Night,
assessing the sins and blessings of the darkly imprisoned spirits, penetrating their past karmic bonds.
Once past karmic bonds are dissolved, they enter the Hall of Wondrous Transformation.
*Zi* means "to join."
*Zhen* is celestial truth.
The Supreme Nonbeing Perfected delivers the souls of the Nine Dark Realms,
thoroughly discerning their past evil karma, exhausting all to enter the Hall of Wondrous Transformation,
joining the Flying Heavenly Ones in union with truth.

*"Yuanfan, Huimo,"*
*"Yihai, Youji, Duren."*
*"Bingzi, Yuqingwen"*—these eight characters are the celestial sounds of *Jiayi* Heaven.
*Yuanfan* is the *qi* of the Primordial Beginning’s Great Brahma, vast and nurturing,
upholding the essence of limpid vastness, lofty and pervading the void, suspended yet never falling.
*Huimo* signifies boundless and unimpeded, existent yet as if nonexistent,
subtle beyond naming, wondrous beyond seeking.
Dark and silent, unseen and unheard,
within it lies truth, within it lies essence—mysteriously delivering heavenly beings.
Upon recitation, knock the teeth five times,
then with eyes closed, visualize the five numinous *qi* of purple crystal mist
arriving from the North’s Boundless Dark Void.
After a long while, softly recite the prayer of the Jade Dawn Lord.
The prayer of the Jade Dawn Lord of the Eight Heavens’ Primordial Measure in the North reads:

*"Divine One who transforms the unsurpassed,
Celestial passage congeals the mysterious *qi*.
The true essence of Yang’s radiance,
Great Harmony nurtures wondrous wisdom.
The Nine Numinous Ones guard the Western Kunlun,
Mechanisms of transformation halt at the pivotal assembly.
Phoenix chariots ascend feathered wheels,
Crossing this kalpa’s ford.
Cloudy banks embrace the round and luminous,
Nurturing the life of heavenly divine lords.
Receiving talismans in the Feathered Forest Palace,
Their verdant splendor girds the numinous mist’s lapel.
Through empty skies fly the mysterious scriptures,
Lifting the body to transcend and soar.
Heavenly governance gathers the Eight Radiances,
Opening and aiding the Nine Dark Realms’ souls.
The Orchid Palace connects to the Purple Tenuity,
Following the pattern to ascend the Vermilion Mound.
In the Southern Palace dwells the wondrous youth,
With jade-like radiance refining my form.
Azure mists float the green chariot,
Proclaiming jubilation and revering the exalted.
A numinous wind ripples through cavernous echoes,
To be treasured for boundless ages.
The Nine Immortals bestow the kalpa’s register,
Dissolving the roots of past karma.
The net’s principles uphold the void’s Brahma,
Expansively returning to namelessness.
The Great Chaos records the hundred bones,
Revolving mists merge with purple clouds.
Blessings extend to seven generations of descendants,
Misfortunes seal the three paths’ sources.
Unbinding entanglements from the dust’s net,
Side by side, guests of carefree wandering.
In an instant, ascending the Dragon Terrace,
Bowing before the Jade Emperor."*

Upon concluding the prayer, visualize the five numinous *qi* of the earlier purple mist,
five layers of dark clouds covering and enveloping the body.
The flying tortoise and feathered canopy, lush and verdant, recite the secret incantation before and after:

*"Dark heavens meander,
Flowing light ascends the Upper Clarity.
The Great Possession initiates the kalpa’s turning,
Eight characters reveal illumination.
Flying mystery stills the void,
The cavernous yin spontaneously arises.
Five *qi* entwine,
Irrigating my form.
Crowned and girded in the Northern Luminaries,
Receiving refinement from the cavernous numen.
The kidney palace transforms into immortality,
Inner and outer radiance gleams.
Flying through the Three Realms,
Roaming and feasting in the Purple Court.
Seven ancestors rejoice together,
Delighting in the kalpa’s ages.
Within the Seven Treasures Grove,
Rebirth returns the womb.
Emerging from the Long Night,
Names recorded in the Southern Palace.
Yellow registers and white tablets,
Generation upon generation born as immortals."*

Upon concluding the incantation, guide the five numinous *qi* forward, swallowing them five times,
merging them with the five viscera, like the hue of purple crystal illuminating all.
Practicing this for five years,
one attains the essence of the five *qi* of numinous mushrooms,
restoring youth and retaining radiance,
preserving life in the Three Clarities,
bestowing blessings upon seven generations of ancestors,
and ensuring immortality for all future generations.

*Scripture of the Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation, Upper Chapter, Methods – Scroll the Fourth*
*Scripture of the Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation, Upper Chapter, Methods – Scroll the Fifth*

**The Chapter of the Profound and Obscure**

The Dao speaks: These are the great Brahma’s esoteric incantations and boundless sounds of the various heavens, their ancient script extending a full *zhang* in length. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign once transcribed their text to establish the correct intonation.

Li Shaowei’s annotation: *The Scripture of the True One’s Five Teeth* states: The Sovereign’s origins in attaining the Dao remain unknown. His body stood nine *chi* tall, covered in dark fur, each strand over a *chi* in length. During the Yellow Emperor’s reign, he dwelled beneath the Absolute Yin of Mount Emei, his abode wrought of azure jade, his seat of gold. Banners of patterned silk fluttered, and thousand-fold incense burned. His attendants—immortal youths and jade maidens—alongside three seated guests, all bore the title of Supreme Clarity’s Immortal Kings. The Yellow Emperor bowed twice to inquire of the Dao, whereupon the Sovereign bestowed upon him the scripture of the Five Teeth and Three Ones.

**The Chapter of the Profound Response**

Those who comprehend these sounds and recite them in purification rites shall have the flying heavenly divine kings of all heavens descend to observe their person, record their merits, and submit them to the heavens. The myriad spirits shall pay homage, earth deities stand guard at their gates, and the great demon kings shall safeguard and recommend them as immortals.

The Imperial Annotation states: One of great merit and virtue shall earn the trust of the Celestial Thearch and the demon kings, who will then recommend them before the Supreme Immortal Kings. With the Dao perfected, they may traverse the Three Realms and ascend through the Gate of Gold.

The Profound Master says: Those who know the sounds of the middle chapter and recite them in purification shall attain the blessings of the eighth rank. These sounds repel all, dispel all, deliver all, and accomplish all—utterances of the heavens’ spontaneous truth. Thus, reciting them summons flying immortals to descend in observation, the Celestial Thearch to chant from afar, the myriad spirits to pay homage, the Three Realms to attend their chariot, demonic hordes to bow their heads, ghostly essences to perish of their own accord, and jade-like tones to resonate. The *You* script declares: The ten directions grow solemn and pure, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists, the myriad spirits tremble in submission, and immortals gather in assembly. The heavens are free of defilement, the earth devoid of demonic dust, profound wisdom shines with limpid clarity, and the vastness of the profound remains profoundly profound. The *Hai* script states: The sounds of the middle chapter possess four boundless, majestic, and numinous powers—repelling, dispelling, delivering, and accomplishing. Those who recite them shall receive the sixteenfold auspicious responses.

The above constitutes the main text and postscript of the great Brahma’s esoteric incantations.

Cheng Xuanying’s annotation: This elucidates the power of the inner sounds of the heavens to penetrate and illuminate with obscure wisdom. *Obscure* denotes the unfathomably profound; *wisdom*, the boundlessly illuminating. Wisdom illuminates emptiness, hence the term *obscure wisdom*. *Vast* implies limitless height, while *limpid* signifies radiance above the Three Clarities. *Vast* is emptiness; *limpid* is purity. Without boundary or end, it is called *great vastness*. Within this great vastness dwells true emptiness; within true emptiness lies essence; within essence lies sincerity, which gives rise to true sages. Neither existent nor nonexistent, it abides in serene constancy, subtle beyond measure. To fathom its principle is impossible—profound within the profound, hence *the vastness of the profound remains profoundly profound*.

Earth officials present the scripture; a hundred spirits revere and respect. Vermilion gods transcribe the text; wearing it yields evident efficacy.

Ten directions’ Heavenly Perfected, exalted sages, Perfected of wondrous conduct, boundless flying celestial kings, the Three Realms’ great demons, the Nine Heavens’ countless elders—all chant the jade scriptures, take refuge in the Most High *Lingbao* wondrous Dharma, flourishing through eons, enduring eternally.

Body holds the Dao’s register, world possesses life’s root.
Golden tablets and jade talismans, names inscribed on the solar chariot.
Wishes instantly fulfilled, celestial records flourish.
Desires align with the heart, myriad spirits fill the gate.
Constantly abide with the Most High, the Emperor Unity in the mud-pill palace.*

Amidst the union of yin and yang, the hundred spirits entwine.
Recite the scriptures ten thousand times, cloud chariots come to receive.
Escorting the feast of the Five Emperors, the Nine Lords of Sun and Moon.
I attain immortality, ascending to the Jade Court.
Receive the office.

Clasp the Jade Purity mudra with both hands.
Knock the teeth nine times, chant:
*Your servant has completed the recitation of the scriptures. The Three and Five Functionaries of your servant’s body, the left and right official messengers, the golden lads attending incense, the jade maidens transmitting words, the direct talismans of the Five Emperors, and the incense officials of the appointed day—thirty-two each—now return to their golden chambers and jade halls. Let no errors arise; preserve my longevity. When summoned again, let them arrive as before, all according to precedent.*

Conclude the mudra, concentrate the mind, and restore the officials. Knock the teeth three times, offer incense, and with eyes closed, secretly chant:
*Those who have attended the scripture recitation, the sacred hosts who guarded the scriptures—now disperse the altar, dissolve the assembly, and return each to their posts. Let the divine winds fall silent, mountains and seas grow solemn and clear. A thousand evils hide in submission, a hundred spirits guard my form.*

Visualize the perfected saints of the ten directions, each ascending on clouds to the heavens, beginning from the east. For each direction, knock the teeth three times, bow thrice in the heart, then draw in the three-colored cloud qi with the nose, swallowing it into the five viscera. Envision the Four Numinous Beasts returning to their original positions. Knock the teeth three times, swallow saliva thrice, and conclude.

Return to the incense burner, chant:
*Follow the cyclical pattern from the *si* text to the *chen* text, passing through *yin* to *chou*, returning to the Jade Purity text. Clasp the mudra until reaching the incense burner, then release.*

*Immortal spirits, immortal officials, golden lads and messengers, the immortals and perfected of the Five Emperors and Five Marchmounts, the true deities of the Three Qi, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, celestial and terrestrial immortals, the incense officials of the Five Numinous Spirits—now summon the upright qi of the ten directions. May the golden elixir, cinnabar mushrooms, and azure herbs naturally arise. Let the hundred spirits and hosts of perfected gather at the grotto mystery and numinous treasure feast hall. Envision the five-colored auspicious radiance and auspicious qi intertwining with the perfected, thoroughly irrigating your servant’s body. Grant that your servant, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality. Let my entire household receive blessings, and the world be enveloped in grace.*

For the deliverance of the deceased, chant:
*May the departed souls be delivered, the living receive grace. Let the jade lads and maidens of the ten directions attend the incense smoke. Envision the incense smoke ascending straight into the heavens, reporting: Your servant’s words just uttered swiftly reach the august presence of the Most High Primordial Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavens before the imperial seat.*

Release the mudra.
Next, perform the *Three Hearings of the Scripture*.

After the scripture has been heard, may all beings deeply enter the Dharma gate, take refuge, and receive it in faith.
After the scripture has been heard, may all beings have their myriad sins absolved and their virtuous sprouts grow.
After the scripture has been heard, may all beings forever sever delusion and constantly return to the true Dao.

Next, follow the intent of the scripture recitation with prayers of dedication.

In truth, the precious scriptures of the Three Caverns are the sacred models of the ten thousand heavens, weaving the flying mysteries into refined patterns, forming the cloud-seal chapters. Their meaning pervades the floating lives of mortals, and their texts endure through eternal kalpas. Thus, heaven and earth rely upon them for division and judgment; sun and moon depend on them for their movements. Ghosts and spirits revere them and thereby attain transformation; the people uphold them and thus bring forth prosperity. Therefore, those who recite them ascend in form to the crimson clouds, and those who hear them rise in spirit to the golden palaces. None fail to look up to them in the realms of humans and gods, or to rely on them in life and death. They serve as the bridge for all classes of beings and the door and window for all living things. Those who cannot hear them—how profound is their great vehicle’s mysterious treasury!

Earlier, your servant ascended the scripture seat and reverently recited *The Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Limitless Salvation of All People, Upper Chapter* for a certain number of scrolls, completing the recitation in harmony. Today, on this occasion, I offer prayers to the sacred ranks, presenting the intentions of my supplications. In essence, I extend reverence to the highest perfected ones, seeking their luminous blessings. For the deliverance of the deceased, I declare: May the departed ascend and dwell in the immortal realms.

As for this scripture, when its case is opened and its mysteries expounded, its resonance pierces the Three Heavens; when its scroll is held and its verses chanted, its sound reaches the Nine Billion. May the golden lads attending the incense inscribe fragrant characters in the heavens, and may the jade youths in charge of the scriptures present its words upon the tablets. Thus, may transgressions from a hundred kalpas be dissolved, and blessings descend upon this day. May the living and the dead alike receive the grace of deliverance, and may all moving and growing things feel the gift of life’s completion. May all the countless kinds of beings, the dim and the stirring, together board the boat of the Six Perfections and ascend to the shores of the Three Clarities.

Specific intentions are separately recorded.

Proclaim the repentance, for the sake of excellent karmic conditions, and invoke:
The Most High Heavenly Worthy of the Three Clarities,
The Heavenly Worthy of Peace and National Protection,
The Heavenly Worthy of Limitless Blessings,
The Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life Preservation,
The Heavenly Worthy of Disaster Dispelling and Calamity Deliverance,
The Purple Clarity Heavenly Worthy of Bestowed Blessings,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Great One’s Salvation from Suffering,
The Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure,
The Heavenly Worthy of Complete and Perfect Flower Blessings,
And the immeasurable, inconceivable merits.

**Exiting the Chamber Spell:**
Exiting the yin, entering the yang, the myriad spirits open wide. The matters of the ritual are concluded—pray close the immortal chamber.

According to *The Oral Instructions on Visualization*:
The Azure Dragon on the left, the White Tiger on the right,
The Vermilion Bird in front, the Dark Warrior behind,
The Lion as the earthly beast beneath me—these ride with me.
The white cranes and flying birds above me—these cover me.
The spirits of the four directions, above and below, all arrive, known as the Six Ritual Arrangements.
Thus, they are arrayed to the left and right, front and back, above and below—this is clear.
Hence the phrase: "The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane arrayed."

The left eye is the sun, the right eye is the moon.
The sun emerges from the left as the Great Yang of the left eye,
The moon emerges from the right as the Great Yin of the right eye.
This principle of the sun and moon on the left and right is also evident.
Hence the phrase: "The sun and moon on the left and right illuminate."

As for the Daoist teaching on these two chapters:
The great method states that the first chapter, from *The Primordial Cavern Mystery* to *The Arrayed Words of the Highest Clarity*, forms one chapter.
The second chapter, from *The Primordial Cavern Jade Calendar* to *The Obeisance to the Lofty Perfected*, forms another.
*The Purple Text of the Cinnabar Emperor of Tortoise Mountain* clearly annotates: "This is the demon-king’s song, proclaiming that I possess the true text of the Cavern Chapter."
Some mistakenly regard it as two chapters, leading to erroneous transmission and persistent errors, greatly distorting the scripture’s intent.
I dare not insist on correction but have consulted the great methods to verify this, appending it after "I possess the Cavern Chapter."
May those who recite it humbly seek understanding. The finger gestures and their instructions are listed below.
