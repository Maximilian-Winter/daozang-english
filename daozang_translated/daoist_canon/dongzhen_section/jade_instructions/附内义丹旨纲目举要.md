**The Inner Essentials of the *Supreme Origin: The Most Wondrous Scripture for Transcending Measure and Attaining the Highest Rank***

**Scripture Title:** *The Inner Essentials of the Supreme Origin: The Most Wondrous Scripture for Transcending Measure and Attaining the Highest Rank*
Composed by the Southern Song Daoist Xiao Yingshou. Five volumes.
Source text: *The Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* (Vital Perfection) Section, *Yujue* (Jade Precepts) Category.

**The Concise Outline of the Inner Essentials and the Core Intent of the Elixir**
Disciple Mei Yan Lin Yuanding, surnamed Zhengfu, records the essentials.

The sacred text of *Lingbao* is the very utterance of the Great Sage, the Supreme Origin Heavenly Venerable, who imparted it to the Jade Dawn Dao Lord. Within the scripture, reference is made to the *Middle Chapter of the Ling Book*, which is the Jade Dawn Dao Lord expounding upon what he had received from the Supreme Origin. Though the words differ, the Dao is one.

As Master Guanfu observed in *The Mystic Resonance of the Inner Essentials and the Elixir’s Intent*:
It comprises thirty-one chapters.

The Supreme Origin Great Luo Heavenly Person is the *Ancestral Qi*.
The Dao Lord of the Western Na Kingdom is the *Golden Mother*.
The Most Venerable Laozi, the utmost essence of primal birth and the most refined manifestation of form, is the *Elixir Body*.
All are the true nature of the self—never separate entities.

To scrutinize these words is to penetrate all things, revealing truths unattested by former sages. This is not achieved through empty speculation but through earnest practice alone.

Yet the varied names invoked may perplex the student.
For instance: *Geng-Tiger, Jia-Dragon*, *Sun-Soul, Moon-Spirit*, *Red Lead, Black Tin*, *Cinnabar, Vermilion Mercury*—though all are the primal *Yi-qi*, how could one not be bewildered upon first encounter?

Without fear of error, I, Yuanding, merge disparate terms into a coherent outline, neither augmenting nor fabricating, but simply transmitting what I received from the Master in plain terms. The prose lacks poetic grace, yet the principles are clear—serving not only to elucidate the Master’s teachings but also to dispel the student’s doubts.

**Ancestral Qi**
The primal, void, and naturally arising Ancestral Qi—
In the scripture, it is called the *Void Sovereign, Supreme Origin Heavenly Venerable*;
In the human body, it is the *Uncorrupted Primordial Spirit of past kalpas*;
In elixir practice, it is the *Void Qi, Golden Embryo*.

It is also called *Golden Mother, Silver Essence, Silver Furnace, Yang Essence, Elixir Body*.
When its transformative mechanism converges in the central palace, it is termed *Elixir Mother, Elixir Foundation*;
When it is imbued by the wondrous transformative Qi and takes form, it is called *Dark Pearl, Sacred Embryo, Infant*.

As in the *Lingbao Scripture*: *"The Mixed Void, Crimson Text, Primordial Cavern, Jade Calendar"*—
In elixir practice, this is *True Lead*, within which lies *Silver*.
It is the one true spirit of humanity, within which resides the spirit.

---
**True Lead**
True Lead is the spirit within nature, the *yang within yin*.
As in the *Paramount Concordance*: *"The *kan* essence of the fifth month"*;
As in the *Awakening to Reality*: *"Bearing yin yet embracing yang-soul"*—
In material terms, it is *silver within lead*;
In the Five Phases, it is *gold within water*;
In the human body, it is *spirit within nature*.
Though named in myriad ways, it does not depart from the one essence.

If one returns to the root and seeks the source, the principle is not distant.
As the *Lingbao Scripture* states:
*"The Mixed Void, Crimson Text—
The peerless True One,
The Supreme Origin’s ancestral kalpa,
Giving rise to all heavens,
Illuminating the three luminaries—
This is the Heavenly Root,
All originating from the Ancestral Qi."*

Yet the varied names—*Golden Official, Wu-Soil, Black Tiger, Yellow Sprout, White Snow*—are but alternate designations for Lead.
In essence, they are the *original face*.
Now, I clarify for fellow students: it is simply the one true nature of humanity.

Nature arises from the void, from empty Qi descending into substance—
Just as lead emerges from silver ore,
And water generates from gold.

As the *Book of Transformation* says: *"Void transforms beyond the spirit"*—
These are idle words; do not waste thought upon them.
The scripture states:
*"The Dao gives birth to One;*
*Again, it says: Obtain the One, and all things are complete.*
This One is the truth.

As the *Lingbao: Law of the Cosmic Region* declares:
*"The Ancestral Qi of the Supreme Origin—
Before form, how shall it be likened?
If one knows this, what difficulty is there in likening it?"*

---
**True Mercury**
True Mercury is not the post-heaven yin-mingled substance but the primal Ancestral Qi.
Each day, it arises anew as the yang-qi ascends, interacting with the Lead-qi to congeal—
Coarsely termed *cinnabar*.
When the yang reaches its peak and the yin descends, it is called *"extracting mercury from cinnabar."*
Mercury is the *yin within yang*.

As in the *Paramount Concordance*: *"The radiance of the self’s sun"*;
As in the *Awakening to Reality*: *"The雄 containing the雌 within"*—
In material terms, it is *mercury within cinnabar*;
In the Five Phases, it is *fire generated by wood*;
In the human body, it is *Qi taking form*.
Though named differently, it is the same Qi.

If one returns to the source and aligns with the root, the elixir is complete.
As the *Lingbao Scripture* states:
*"The Great Movement of the Dharmic Qi,
Circulating through the ten directions,
The Dharmic Qi of the Pralaya,
Unfolding myriad patterns."*

Names such as *Zhan-Nü, Vermilion Dragon, Flowing Pearl, QuickSilver, Ji-Soil* are but alternate designations for Mercury—
Collectively termed *medicinal substances*.
Now, I clarify for fellow students: it is simply the *Qi of the yang-essence’s emergence*.

Qi arises from the spirit’s transformation, interacting and generating sentiment—
Just as cinnabar forms from lead,
Mercury is extracted from cinnabar,
Water generates wood,
And fire arises from wood.

To seek the Dao beyond this is to incite emotional attachment.
As the *Book of Transformation* says: *"The spirit transforms into Qi."*
The scripture states:
*"One gives birth to Two; Two gives birth to Three—*
This is the truth.

As the *Law of the Cosmic Region* says:
*"Transforming to produce all treasures,
Descending into substance as Qi—
In this world, what form does it take?
If one knows this, what difficulty is there in embodying it?"*

---
**Return and Reversion**
Lead and Mercury are, in truth, of one source—
Just as lead arises from silver,
Cinnabar forms from lead,
And mercury is extracted from cinnabar—
This is the principle of material nature.

Just as water generates from gold,
Water nurtures wood,
And fire arises from wood—
This is the workings of creation.

**Return and Reversion**

Cinnabar and mercury mutually resonate—
When lead is added, silver is formed;
Wood and fire oppose each other—
When earth is generated, gold arises—
This illustrates how within the human body, the *Dao* manifests as *qi* from emptiness,
Condensing into substance and thus taking form—
This is called *xing-qi* (性炁).

From *xing* forming and moving, *qing* (情) arises;
When *xing* governs *qing*, and *qing* returns to *xing*,
The return to emptiness is achieved—
This is the principle of *return and reversion*.

Yet common folk, unaware of the Dao’s essence,
Confuse *xing* with *qing*,
And from *qing* derive *shi* (识);
Once *qing* and *shi* are stirred,
The original *xing* is lost.

Little do they know that *shen* (神) and *qi* (炁),
As well as *xing* (性) and *qing* (情),
Are all but the empty primordial *qi*,
Descending into form and artificially named—
The adept can unite with this through innate roots,
Received by the teacher’s oral transmission and mental guidance,
And thus return to its origin.

What is called *roots* (根) is, in truth, no separate thing—
It is simply *xing* and *shen* (神性).
When it abides according to time within the inner chambers,
It is called *wu-tu* (戊土), known as *xing*.
When one *qi* circulates and interacts, generating mutual excitation,
It is called *ji-tu* (己土), known as *qing*.
When *xing* governs *qing*, and *qing* returns to *xing*,
Then *being* and *non-being* intermingle,
Hidden and revealed align,
Empty and substantial harmonize,
Movement and stillness nourish one another—
And thus the cinnabar essence is perfected.

This is called *chun-qian* (纯乾), or *xuan-ti* (玄体).
*Chun-qian* refers to the firm, robust, and upright essence—
Pure, refined, and subtle.
*Xuan-ti* refers to the gathering into form when condensed,
And the returning to *qi* when dispersed—
Only at this point can one truly speak of the Dao of *golden elixir return*.

As the *Paramartha Contract* says:
*"When gold returns to its nature, it is then called cinnabar."*
And again:
*"Kan flows into Wu, Li adheres to Ji."*

As the *Awakening to True Scripture* says:
*"Take the real essence of the Kan position in the heart,
Transform it through the Li palace in the abdomen’s Yin—
From this arises the pure, robust body,
Hidden yet capable of flight—all by the mind’s will."*

Thus, in accordance with these teachings,
The scriptural principles of *tilting light to return to the chariot*,
*Overseeing the True to guide rebirth*,
*Commanding the Earthly Devas*,
And *attending and escorting*—
All align without contradiction.

As the *Law of the Cosmic Region* says:
*"When this *qi* is further refined and transformed,
It becomes the elixir that leads to transcendence—
The principle is thus revealed."*

**The Dao of Golden Elixir**
The Dao of the golden elixir requires only that one
*Perceive nature and clarify the mind*,
*Return to the root and restore the vital essence*,
*Restore its original state*,
And *revert to emptiness*—
This is called the Dao.

The Dao is that which,
Though unseen by sight, is never absent,
And though unheard by ear, is never silent—
It transcends all boundaries.

Though it cannot be seen or heard,
The Dao is never truly absent—
This is the principle of *inner symbolism*:
*"The substance is hidden within the form,
The form is void yet contains the essence."*

If scholars fail to deeply grasp this,
Some say it *is*,
Some say it *is not*,
Some say it *seems to be yet seems not*,
Some say it is *neither being nor non-being*—
All are mistaken.

Let me explain:
The external teachings and separate methods
All take lead and mercury as *yin* and *yang*,
And vital essence as medicinal substance,
The mouth and nostrils as the *Mysterious Feminine*,
The heart and kidneys as *Kan* and *Li*.

With bellows and tripods competing in their operations,
Red and purple distinctions are blurred—
Their confusion and errors are countless.

How could they know that when *qing* and *shi* are stirred,
This is the *vital spirit and essence*?
When one disturbs the *vital spirit and essence*,
The original *xing* is lost—
If *xing* is obscured, where is the Dao?

Thus the *Buddhist teachings* say:
*"Those who study the Dao yet fail to recognize the True,
Merely chase after the *shen* (神) from the start—
Through countless kalpas, they remain bound to birth and death,
While fools call this the ‘original body.’"*
This is precisely the case.

The Dao of the golden elixir has
*A foundation and a root*,
*A body and a function*—
Once the original *xing* is clarified,
The mind is pure and the emotions are tranquil.

As our *Confucian scholars* say:
*"Rectify the heart and sincerely intend,
Extend knowledge and investigate things,
Subdue the self and return to propriety,
Reflect upon oneself and achieve sincerity—
How could this be external to the Dao?"*

When applied to serving the ruler,
It manifests as *loyalty*;
When applied to honoring parents,
It manifests as *filial piety*;
When applied to interacting with others,
It manifests as *sincerity*;
When applied to cultivating oneself,
It manifests as *rectitude*.

It harmonizes with the Void and unites with the Non-existent,
Ever-clear and ever-still,
True emptiness and wondrous being,
Piercing emptiness and complete penetration—
Thus the *Supreme Sage* says:
*"Artificially named, it is called the Dao."*
What is called *elixir*, then, is but what?

As the *Awakening to True Scripture* says:
*"Further, one must investigate the root of nature above,
And resolve the wondrous, non-arising function—
If one attains this, then all that inner symbolism reveals
Will be pure jade, without variation in hue."*

This aligns with the *Heavenly Emperor’s Jade True, Colorless* state,
And the *Dharma of the Vimalakirti* (景梵行).

As the *Odes* say:
*"The Heavenly One’s carriage moves without sound or scent—
This is the ultimate sincerity."*

The scripture says:
*"Profound wisdom pierces clarity,
Immense capacity is the deepest mystery—
This is the ultimate truth."*

Ah! It is complete.

**Releasing the Mysterious Diagram of the Supreme Extremity’s Marvelous Transformation and Divine Unity**
The *Diagram of the Supreme Extremity* was created by Master Lu Xi (濂溪先生),
Illuminating the profound mysteries of creation
And transmitting the unspoken secrets of the ancient sages.

**Releasing the Mysterious Diagram of the Supreme Extremity’s Marvelous Transformation and Divine Unity**

**Releasing the Diagram of the Body’s Symbolic Representation**
This diagram is called *Inner Symbol* (内象), metaphorically depicting within the human body the joints and vessels, the crucibles and chambers. Practitioners of the *Inner Elixir* (丹) must thoroughly comprehend this diagram, for only then will they grasp the foundation of the *Crucible’s Symbolic Setting* (炉鼎设象) and the source of the *Lead and Mercury’s Return to the Origin* (铅汞归元). The vital chambers and their mysteries are of utmost solemnity—one must not dare to casually divulge them. Yet Master Lu has already revealed its essential principles within the diagram itself. Those of wisdom who study the scriptures will surely gain insights from it.

**Releasing the Diagram of the Great Return’s Heart-Mirror and Fire Refining**
Master Lu expounded upon the *Heart-Mirror and Fire Refining* (大还心镜火候图) of the *Peng True Person* (彭真人), elucidating the profound applications of the *Hidden Language* (隐语). Who beneath the heavens can fully fathom this unless they are the most enlightened?

Some may ask: "Does not all the logic beneath the heavens ultimately return to One? Yet the *Hidden Language* speaks of sixty-four *Hexagrams* (卦) above, and twelve *Hexagrams* (卦) repeated below—why is this so?"

The reply is: "Have you not seen Master’s words? The *Hexagrams* of the *Hidden Language* above, marked by *Jiazi* (甲子), are the *Scripture* (经); the *Hexagrams* below, detailing seasonal nodes and the sun’s shadow (节候时晷), are the *Canon’s Subtext* (纬). The distinction between *Scripture* and *Subtext* is clear—what cause for doubt remains?

What is called *Scripture* (经) is the *Dragon-Tiger Scripture* (《龙虎经》), wherein it is said:
*"Water and fire each occupy their own domain,
Guarding boundaries to produce cold and heat."*

By dividing the heavens as *Scripture*—north and south—
It aligns with the *Yijing*’s *"The Celestial is exalted, the Terrestrial is humble,
The *Hexagrams* of *Qian* and *Kun* are established"* (《易》天尊地卑、乾坤定矣).

What is called *Subtext* (纬) is the *Scripture*’s explanation of:
*"East and west display the virtues of *Ren* and *Yi*,
The Five Phases transform into the Four Seasons."*

By weaving the heavens and earth as *Subtext*—east and west—
It corresponds to the *Yijing*’s *"The sun and moon move in their courses,
Alternating cold and heat"* (日月运行、一寒一暑).

The *Awakening to True Scripture* (《悟真篇》) states:
*"First, grasp *Qian* and *Kun* as the crucibles,
Then, use the *U-Fu* (乌兔) elixir to refine them."*

This is why the *Scripture* and *Subtext* are distinguished.
Yet their meanings are the same, their words differ—
Scholars cannot help but question,
So now I clarify it.

The third ring of the *Heart Mirror*—the thirty waxing and waning cycles—
is indeed the thirty days of a month.

By excluding the *Hexagrams* of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* (the Four Pillars as crucibles and elixir ingredients),
and using the remaining sixty *Hexagrams*,
each day governs two *Hexagrams* in direct succession,
thus encompassing the sixty *Hexagrams* of the *Ganzzi* (甲子) cycle over thirty days.

The fourth ring—one hundred black and white *qi* points—
is the one hundred *ke* (刻) of a day.

By arranging these one hundred *qi* points above the thirty days,
and preserving the cycle of a month returning to a day,
the *Ganzzi* (甲子) of the upper *Hexagram* in *The Hidden Words* (*《隐语》*) is thus established.

The fifth and sixth rings—twenty-four *qi* (炁) and twelve *Chen* (辰)—
are what the Master previously linked to the lower portion of *The Hidden Words*,
to elucidate the alternating cycles of cold and heat,
the swift return of years to months,
and the swift return of months to days.

The seventh and eighth rings,
which gather and harmonize the Five Phases,
and integrate the Four Symbols into the Central Palace (*中宫*),
where they interweave and generate to form the essence of the *Dan* (丹),
are what the Master revealed in the lower section of *The Hidden Words*
regarding the eight upper *Hexagrams*.

If scholars merely split the third ring of the *Heart Mirror*—the eclipse of waxing and waning—
at the midpoint and extend it straight,
this is the upper and lower *Ganzzi* (甲子) of *The Hidden Words*.

If they bend it and round it,
it becomes the *Great Return Heart Mirror Fire Refining Diagram* (*《大还心镜火候图》*).

If they erect it vertically,
it aligns with the diagrams of the body’s symbols and analogies;
the profound subtleties of its principles become evident,
how profound and wondrous!
What more could scholars doubt?

The Master’s elucidation of the *Scripture*’s essence
and alignment with the *Dan* mechanism,
marked by *The Taiji Diagram* (*《太极图》*) at the beginning of the text,
and the *Heart Mirror Diagram* (*《心镜图》*) summarized at its conclusion,
serves to clarify the Dao of form and function,
and to reveal the principles of generation and transformation.

Yet scholars, following its traces, often find contradictions.
The *Yuan Ding* (元鼎) now further clarifies this for you.

*The Taiji Diagram* (*《太极图》*)
illuminates the origin of lead and mercury as one,
thus moving from inner to outer,
from non-being to being.

*The Heart Mirror Diagram* (*《心镜图》*)
illuminates the return of lead and mercury to their origin,
moving from outer to inner,
from being to non-being.

The *Scripture* begins with a unified principle,
form and function are in harmony,
exhausting the mysteries of creation’s mechanisms,
leaving no further essence.

The practice of refining one’s body and attaining the *Dan* is complete here.

**Core Essence and Alchemical Principles (内义丹旨纲目举要)**
This book by Master Mei Yan (梅岩) is concise and clear.
Even *The Golden Key of Great Return* (*《还丹金钥匙》*) and *The Red Lead Black Tiger Treatise* (*《红铅黑虎论》*)
cannot match its simplicity.

Placing it at the beginning,
scholars need not ask the way of a roadside boy or child
to reach the *Zhuoquzi* (具茨) mountain
and behold the Great Yuan (大隗).

This is the teaching of Master Guanfu (观复) and the book by Xiao Yingshou (萧应叟).
