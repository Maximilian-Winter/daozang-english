**Huangdi Yin Fu Jing Zhu (The Commentary on the Huangdi Yin Fu Classic) – Cai Shi’s Annotation**

**Upper Section**

To observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp Heaven’s operations—this is all there is.

The Dao divides into Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth divide into the myriad things. Among the myriad things, humanity is the most refined. Originally, it shares the same substance as Heaven and Earth, yet what humanity receives from Heaven and Earth is pure or mixed in differing ways. Thus, one must observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp its operations, for then the Dao resides within oneself.

When speaking of Heaven, one does not speak of Earth, for Earth is contained therein.

Heaven has five "bandits"—those who perceive them flourish.
The five "bandits" dwell in the heart and manifest in Heaven’s operations.
The cosmos lies within the palm; myriad transformations arise from the body.

The five "bandits" are the Five Phases.
The good of the world arises from these five; evil also stems from them. Hence, reversing the speech, they are called "bandits."

Though the five "bandits" belong to Heaven and Earth, they are also the very means by which Heaven and Earth were formed.
Descending into humanity, they become this mind.
If one recognizes their workings, one can apply them to Heaven and Earth, and thus creation rests within oneself.
Hence it is said: *Those who perceive them flourish.*

Heaven’s nature—humanity.
Humanity’s heart—a mechanism.
Establish Heaven’s Dao to settle humanity.

What Heaven and Earth possess as nature is tranquil and boundless, unseen and unattainable.
Yet what humanity inherits is the very nature of Heaven and Earth.
Thus it is said: *Heaven’s nature is humanity.*

Humanity’s heart acts spontaneously, unaware of its own workings—that is the mechanism.
The reason Heaven moves and Earth remains still is this mechanism.
This mechanism in humanity—what cannot it achieve?
To become Yao and Shun, or Jie and Zhou—both are the mechanism.
Only by establishing Heaven’s Dao can it be settled, and wisdom attained.
Thus, when it departs, principle is restored.

When Heaven unleashes the killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise upon the land.
When humanity unleashes the killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth invert.
When Heaven and humanity jointly unleash it, the foundation of myriad transformations is set.

The killing mechanism is the mechanism’s excess.
When the *qi* of Heaven and Earth exceeds, anomalies appear and dragons and serpents rise upon the land.
When the human heart exceeds, intentions and thoughts arise, and Heaven and Earth invert.
When Heaven and humanity jointly unleash it, the Dao is present—Heaven’s intent and humanity’s emotions align.
Yet Heaven’s order has its norms, Heaven’s ranks have their rites—these are humanity’s greatest principles.
Western learning regards this as the "worldly net" and rejects it, yet it cannot be shaken because the foundation of myriad changes is fixed and unalterable.

Nature has skill and clumsiness; it can be concealed.
The nine orifices’ evils lie in the three essentials, which can be moved or stilled.
The sage’s nature aligns with Heaven and Earth, yet commoners cannot—because of differing skill and clumsiness.
Only by knowing how to conceal can the clumsy become skilled.
Humanity’s inability to conceal stems from the nine orifices’ evils.
Though there are nine orifices, the essentials are three: the ears, eyes, and mouth.
Knowing how to move and still them, three cycles suffice to purge the nine orifices of evil.

The eyes must see, the ears must hear, the mouth must speak—these cannot be stilled. Yet movement never departs from stillness; stillness is not mere inaction—thus one speaks of moving and stilling.

Fire arises from wood; disaster strikes and overcomes.
Treachery arises in the realm; when the time comes, it collapses.
To know and refine this is to be a sage.

Fire arises from wood, yet sometimes it consumes the wood.
Treachery arises in the realm, yet sometimes it must collapse.
The mechanisms of the five "bandits" follow this pattern.
To know and refine this—who but the sage can do so?
The method of refinement is the doctrine of moving, stilling, and concealing.

**Middle Section**

Heaven generates and Heaven kills—this is the Dao’s principle.
Generation and killing are the Dao’s descent into *qi*, natural and inescapable.

Heaven and Earth are thieves of the myriad things;
The myriad things are thieves of humanity;
Humanity is the thief of the myriad things.
When the three thieves are appropriate, the Three Powers are at peace.

Heaven and Earth generate the myriad things yet also kill them.
The myriad things generate humanity yet also kill it.
Humanity generates the myriad things yet also kills them.
Because they generate yet also kill, reversing the speech, they are called thieves—just as the five "bandits" are named.

Yet when generation and killing are rightly measured, the three thieves are appropriate.
When the three thieves are appropriate, Heaven and Earth are in their place, and the myriad things flourish.
Thus it is said: *Eat in season, and the hundred limbs are in order.*
*Stir the mechanism, and myriad transformations are at peace.*

Heaven and Earth and the myriad things are governed by humanity. If humanity eats in season, the hundred limbs are in order; if it stirs Heaven and Earth’s mechanisms, myriad transformations are at peace.
This is the Dao of thievery.

*Season* refers to the early and late of spring and autumn.
*Mechanism* refers to generation, killing, growth, and nurturing.

Humanity knows the divine’s divinity but does not know how the non-divine is divine.
The divine is the uncanny and unfathomable.
The non-divine are Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, mountains and rivers, the moving and growing things.

Humanity knows the uncanny as divine, yet Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, mountains and rivers, and the moving and growing things—though perceived by ear and eye—are unknown in their divinity.

The sun and moon have their numbers; great and small have their limits.
From this, sagely functions arise, and divine clarity emerges.

The sun and moon—humanity does not know their divinity.
The sun’s number is great, completing three hundred sixty days;
The moon’s number is small, completing three hundred sixty *chén* (constellations).
Heaven and Earth’s transformations do not exceed three hundred sixty.
Thus, the sage’s functions arise from knowing this alone;

The **Dao/Way**’s divinity thus manifests—from this alone.

Those who **steal the mechanism** (of the Dao) are unseen by the world, unknowable by all.
The **gentleman** (君子) who attains it safeguards his own life,
while the **petty man** (小人) who attains it risks his very fate.
**Stealing the mechanism** refers to the five thieves (五贼) rampant between Heaven and Earth—
the **numbers of the sun and moon** (日月之数) as previously mentioned.
To see and know them is to curb the three thieves (三盗),
and thus the Three Talents (三才) find harmony.

Yet, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun (黄帝尧舜) gained renown and longevity,
while Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Shen Buhai, and Han Fei (苏张申韩) perished, their families slaughtered—
all through the **Dao/Way**.

The people can be made to follow it,
but not to understand its workings.
How profound the words!

**Next Section:**
The blind excel in hearing, the deaf in sight.
Severing one source of profit, the teacher’s strength is tenfold;
reversing three cycles of day and night, the teacher’s strength is ten thousandfold.
The blind and deaf, their **will** (志) undivided, one suffices for ten.
**Reversing three cycles** refers to the eyes, ears, and mouth (目、耳、口).
**Return** (反) means to restore to their origin.
Day and night (昼夜) are the movements of **yin and yang** (阴阳).
Once the three are restored,
they transcend the movements of **yin and yang**,
and thus grasp the unity of day and night—
one life and one death—
one suffices for ten thousand.
This is the *Yì* (《易》)’s **mighty and non-slaying** (神武而不杀).

The **heart** (心) is born from things, dies from things—
the **mechanism** (机) lies within the eyes.
The **heart** perceives through things—this is being born from things;
it pursues things and is lost—this is dying from things.
The **orifices** (窍) through which humans encounter things number nine,
but the **vital points** (要) are three,
and the eyes are the most crucial of these three.

Lǎo Dān (老聃) said:
*"Do not see what is desired, and the heart will not be disordered."*
Confucius replied:
*"The eyes of self-mastery (克己之目) must first be disciplined—
and sight (视) is the means to achieve this."*

In the West, the discussion of the six senses and six cognitions (六根六识)
must first mention the eye and color (眼、色)—
all this is the **will** (意).

Heaven’s lack of favor yet gives rise to great kindness.
Swift thunder and fierce winds—
none escape its **unfathomable power** (蠢然).

The **favor without favor** is the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.
Only when there is **favor without favor** can true **favor** arise;
only when there is **non-action** can true **action** be achieved—
this is the **virtue/power** of the Sage, multiplied tenfold,
and only through **threefold return** can it be attained.

The **supreme joy** leaves **virtue/power** in excess;
the **supreme stillness** maintains **virtue/power** in moderation.
Heaven’s **most private** work is deployed with **most public** **virtue/power**.
The **control** of things lies in **qi**.

The **supreme joy** has no **affairs**, thus **virtue/power** overflows,
and it can anticipate the world’s concerns before they arise;
the **supreme purity** is unstained, thus **virtue/power** is unblemished,
and it can share in the world’s calamities as its own.
This is the **Dao/Way** of **threefold return** and **non-action** at its peak—
the work of one who does not pluck a single hair.
Yet Heaven’s **Dao/Way**, though **most private**, is applied with **most public** **virtue/power**,
so **supreme joy** and **supreme purity** are the means by which **action** arises.

So too with things.
What may be taken from things is called **prey**—
yet when all things subdue one another,
who among them **acts** with intent?
It is merely the **natural** working of **qi**.
The tiger and leopard do not conquer the **qilin** through their own prowess,
nor does the eagle and falcon subdue the **phoenix** by their own strength.
This is the **threefold return** of day and night,
by which one attains to **one against ten thousand**.

Life is the root of death;
death is the root of life.
**Favor** arises from harm;
harm arises from **favor**.
Life, death, **favor**, harm—
the **Dao/Way** is never otherwise.
This is why frost and snow, though destructive,
bestow **supreme favor**,
and why rain and dew, though nourishing,
embody **supreme endurance**.

Pushed to its limit, one finds that even in **non-being** and **being**, **stillness** and **movement**,
there is never a moment without their mutual exchange—
thus, what seems **correct** may appear as its **opposite**.

The foolish see Heaven’s **patterns** and Earth’s **principles** as **sagely**,
but I see the **patterns of time** and the **principles of things** as **wise**.
People perceive Heaven’s **patterns** and Earth’s **principles** and call them **sagely**,
yet they do not know *why* they are **sagely**.
I discern Heaven and Earth’s **sageliness** through the **patterns of time** and the **principles of things**.
Heaven’s **patterns** follow seasons;
Earth’s **principles** follow things—
this is **wise** understanding.

When speaking of Heaven and Earth’s **constants**, their **Dao/Way** is thus;
when speaking of what **transforms**, it is also thus.
This is observing Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,
grasping Heaven’s **actions**,
until one is in harmony with the **day and night**,
and in unity with **Creation**—
**movement** and **stillness** in perfect accord.
