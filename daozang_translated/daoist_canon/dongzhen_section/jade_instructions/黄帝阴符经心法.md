**Volume One: The Heart Method of the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing*
Annotated by Xu Yuan Yi, a recluse from Shu’s Tongchuan, Six Emptiness Mountain**

**Chapter: Revealing the Dao of Heaven**

The *Jing* states:
*"To observe the Dao of Heaven, to grasp its movements—this is sufficient.
If you wish to create the *Yin Fu* Dao, focus your efforts on the character ‘observe’ (观),
and do not contrive other interpretations. Concentrate fiercely and keenly.
Silently observe within, and suddenly you will perceive.
My own silent observation—even the sages of past and future, with their mouths sealed and tongues bound,
could not describe the learning of the *Yin Fu Jing*—it is complete."*

Should one not yet attain this, let them examine the following text:
Why?
*Observe* (观) means *to see* (视), *to examine* (察).
*Heaven* (天) refers to *Nature* (自然).
*Dao* (道) means *principle* (理).
*Grasp* (执) means *to hold* (持).
*Movement* (行) means *to practice* (践履).

It states that those who study the Dao must observe and examine the natural principles of Heaven’s Dao,
to understand their own inherent nature.
Those who attain this must hold it in daily life, practicing it with pure mastery,
so that not even for a moment do they depart from it.

The intent of the *Yin Fu Jing* is profound, complete, and cannot be surpassed.
This is the overarching principle of the text,
which is fully elaborated in the following passages.

Heaven has **Five Thieves** (五贼)—those who perceive them thrive.
The Dao of Heaven is but **One Qi** (一气),
yet its transformations manifest as the **Five Phases** (五行).
It is not called the **Five Phases** but the **Five Thieves**,
for they embody Heaven’s Dao—unseen when viewed, unheard when listened to.
They operate between **Yin and Yang** (两仪),
shifting cold and heat, evolving past and future,
generating and transforming all things,
ever advancing while abandoning nothing—who could fathom this?
Thus it says: *Heaven has Five Thieves.*
To *see* (见) is to *understand* (明),
to *thrive* (昌) is to *flourish* (盛).

It means that observing Heaven’s Dao in its **One Qi**,
one perceives the **Five Phases** in their transformations;
applying one’s own Dao in its **One Nature**,
one manifests the **Five Virtues** (五常) in their functions.

The **Five Virtues** (五常) are also formless and soundless,
neither Yin nor Yang,
yet they embody benevolence and righteousness,
excel in both flexibility and firmness,
entering and exiting without fixed time,
known to no one in their origin.
Those who understand—
their **virtue** (德) of the Five Virtues shines ever more brilliant.
Thus it says: *Those who perceive them thrive.*

The **Five Thieves** reside in the heart,
and their actions extend to Heaven.
The **Five Thieves** are the Dao of Heaven.
*Reside in the heart* means that Heaven’s Dao dwells within the human heart.
If Heaven’s Dao resides in the heart,
then the heart itself is the Dao—how profound this statement!

The **Five Thieves** reside in the heart,
for fear that later generations,
studying the observation of Heaven’s Five Thieves,
would seek them only in Heaven’s Heaven (天之天),
and fail to recognize that they must be sought in the Heaven of the heart (心之天).

Such words are piercing—
they urge one to exert effort in revealing the true nature of humanity.

If a person devotes all their strength to the **Five Thieves** residing in the heart,
and directly assumes responsibility for them,
as Zengzi did when he heard the Dao—*one thread runs through all*—
and declared: *"Beyond this ‘one thread,’ there are no other doubts."*
To grasp Confucius’ intent—
is this not exhilarating?

Should one not yet attain this,
they must focus entirely on the **Five Thieves** residing in the heart,
concentrating deeply and savoring its meaning,
until they gain some insight,
and then they will know that daily life is
nothing but the manifestation of my heart’s Heaven,
free from all external interference—
is this not the same as applying it to Heaven?

The *Inner Observation Jing* (《内观经》) states:
*"The Sage teaches people to cultivate the Dao—this is to cultivate the heart.
To teach people to cultivate the heart—this is to cultivate the Dao.
Only the word ‘cultivate’ (修) differs."*

Mencius said:
*"To exhaust one’s heart is to know one’s nature,
and to know one’s nature is to know Heaven."*

The Sage’s words are so simple yet direct,
so clear and unadulterated—
why should scholars harbor any doubts?

The universe lies within one’s grasp,
and all transformations arise from the body.
The *Tongxuan Jing* (《通玄经》) states:
*"The four directions and the four extremes—this is the realm of *space* (宇).
The past and the future—this is the realm of *time* (宙).
All *transformations* (万化) are the endless changes of all things.
*Grasp* (手) and *body* (身) refer to oneself."*

If a person truly attains the **Five Thieves** residing in the heart,
and believes in it with conviction while understanding it thoroughly,
then even the vastness of the four directions and four extremes,
the boundless span of past and future,
and the infinite transformations of all things—
all flow from their own heart,
and they need not rely on others.
Thus Mencius said:
*"All things are complete within me.
To return to sincerity within oneself—
no greater joy exists."*

**Heaven’s nature is humanity** (天性，人也).
**The human heart is the mechanism** (人心，机也).
Humans are born in stillness—
this is the nature of Heaven.
Thus it says: *Heaven’s nature is humanity.*

When nature departs from stillness,
it becomes movement and is called **heart** (心).
The heart is the sovereign of the body,
the essential mechanism of all transformations.
Thus it says: *The human heart is the mechanism.*

The *Great Harmony Jing* (《大通经》) states:
*"Stillness is called nature (性),
yet the heart (心) is within it;
Movement is called heart,
yet nature is within it."*

The character **nature** (性) must not be merely taken as ink on paper—
one must reflect inwardly and verify it,
until they truly grasp its meaning,
and then their study will not be in vain.
If so, they will return to the origin and restore the fundamental,
transcend the mundane and enter the Sagehood—
is this not a reality?

Otherwise, mechanical cleverness and worldly cunning accumulate in the heart,
clashing and wearing against external things,
slipping away from Heaven’s nature,
and degenerating into the delusions of the secular world—
making daily life oblivious,
as distant as Heaven and Earth—
whose fault is this?

Establish the Dao of Heaven,
and thereby settle humanity.
*Establish* (立) means *upright and unyielding* (刚正不倚).
The Dao of Heaven is the Dao of Heaven’s nature.
*Settle* (定) means *to tranquilize* (镇静).
Humanity refers to the heart of human desires (人欲).

The Dao of Heaven’s nature—
when studied to the point of *boundless clarity without self*,
what room remains for human desires?
Before reaching this stage,
one must exert effort and maintain it,
strengthening it with uprightness and unyielding resolve,
to be the master of one’s body.
Tranquilizing the heart of human desires,
preventing it from sprouting,
then the nine orifices and four limbs will not act recklessly,
and the body’s inner and outer will all find peace.*"

Thus it is said: *Establish* the Dao of Heaven to *tranquilize* humanity. If one’s nature lacks the upright and unyielding substance, weak and unable to stand firm, then at the slightest movement, it yields to private human desires, indulging in licentiousness and extravagance, with no limit to its excesses. Such a one who seeks tranquility in the world—there has never been one.

When Heaven unleashes its killing intent, dragons and serpents rise from the earth. When humanity unleashes its killing intent, Heaven and Earth are overturned.
*Killing* here means *threatening power*. *Dragons and serpents* refer to the greatest of hidden forces. *Rising from the earth* means emerging from concealment. *Overturned* means *preverted*.

Heaven’s threatening power is the thunder and lightning. When the time is for stillness, it conceals its intent, silent and unseen, hidden from all. When the time is for action, it responds in due season, without private motive or desire, its roar shaking all things, awakening the hidden and the dormant, freeing them from obscurity, allowing them to flourish and flow freely—all creatures benefit from its grace.

Humanity’s threatening power is the subtle operation of the mind and spirit. Before its manifestation, it aligns with Heaven in perfect unity, imperceptible even to ghosts and spirits, let alone humans. When external things stir sensation, private desires arise, corrupting the purity of Heaven’s principle, unleashing the venom of tigers and wolves. Humanity suffers harm, and all things are disturbed. Hence the Sage laments:

*"When humanity unleashes its killing intent, Heaven and Earth are overturned"*—meaning, how can the movement of the human heart be so utterly inverted from the Dao of Heaven and Earth?

When Heaven and humanity act in harmony, the foundation of ten thousand transformations is set.
*Heaven* refers to the Dao of Heaven. *Humanity* refers to the human heart. *Set* means *unshaken*. *Foundation* means *root*.

The Dao of Heaven responds in due season, without private motive or desire, and all things receive its grace. When humanity, in responding to affairs and engaging with things, governs itself with the same lack of private motive or desire, then Heaven and humanity act in perfect harmony.

If this is so, then when matters and things arise, they come like guests in a lofty hall—though they bring a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, they are met with discernment and without evasion. The still, round, and luminous root, unmoved, is never disturbed.

Yet if even a hair’s breadth of desire lingers within, then humanity unleashes its killing intent—how can this align with the foundation of ten thousand transformations?

Nature has skill and clumsiness, which can be concealed. The original, pure nature, still and undisturbed, is serene as the boundless void—how can there be skill or clumsiness?

The *Classic* says: *"Nature has skill and clumsiness"*—meaning the nature shaped by habit. One whose habit-formed nature is skilled in letters and numbers will be clumsy in archery and charioteering; one skilled in pottery will be unable to measure with the plumb and square.

Thus the Sage admonished: *"It can be concealed."* *Concealed* means *not to display oneself*. If one displays oneself, then one’s abilities will surely be flaunted in arrogance, and one’s deficiencies will surely be sought in desperation. Arrogance leads to the loss of virtue, desperation wastes one’s true essence—both are delusions. Yet with the serene, pure nature, responding and flowing naturally, one nearly attains the Dao.

The nine orifices’ corruption lies in the three gateways, which can be controlled in stillness and motion. The human body, from head to foot, possesses nine orifices through which the virtue of spirit and intelligence flows—like the doors and windows of a dwelling. The three that govern life and death, order and chaos, are the ears, eyes, and mouth.

The ears hear sounds, the eyes see colors, the mouth speaks and argues—thus stirring the heart, sprouting desires, yielding to emotions, and losing one’s nature. Then the nine orifices become corrupt.

Yet, is it not natural for the ears to hear? For the eyes to see? For the mouth to speak? If one says no, humanity is not wood or stone—how could it not be so?

Thus the *Classic* says: *"They can be controlled in stillness and motion."* *Controlled in stillness and motion* means teaching later learners that when these three gateways are stirred by sensation, one must discern what can be heard and heard, what can be seen and seen, what can be spoken and spoken. What cannot be heard, do not hear. What cannot be seen, do not see. What cannot be spoken, do not speak.

If this is so, then the corruption of the nine orifices will have no cause to arise, and the use of the three gateways can be controlled in stillness and motion.

Confucius said: *"Do not look at what is not proper, do not listen to what is not proper, do not speak of what is not proper, do not act on what is not proper—this is all."*

Fire arises from wood; when disaster strikes, it is certain to prevail. Treachery arises in the state; when it moves, it is certain to collapse. To know this and refine oneself—this is the Sage.

Wood giving rise to fire: fire blazes and wood is consumed. Treachery arising in the state: treachery flourishes and the state falls—this is the natural order.

Humanity’s origin is such: if the pure nature remains serene and tranquil, merging with Heaven’s principle, then when the ears and eyes open to the external, and desires and aversions arise within, emotions separate from nature, *qi* scatters and essence is lost—before reaching Heaven’s allotted span, one meets premature death and ruin. How is this different from wood giving rise to fire, or treachery arising in the state?

The Sage transmitted this teaching, intending that later learners observe this, discard emotions and desires, cherish *qi* and economize spirit, remain still and without action, unwavering morning and evening. Such cultivation, such refinement—until the practice is perfected, there is sudden enlightenment to true nature, returning to the root and origin, transcending the mundane and entering sainthood—the Dao of the Sage.

Thus it is said: *To know this and refine oneself*—this is the Sage.

「Shù Tóngchuān’s *Six Emptiness Scattered Man* Xū Yuán-yī’s Annotation
Opens the *Chapter on Nurturing Life*

Heaven’s birth and death are the Dao’s natural order.
Heaven is the Way of effortless spontaneity.
Does it harbor intentions toward life and death?
Rather, the arising of things and their demise—
when their time comes, it is natural.

Thus, one birth and one death,
spring and autumn alternating,
past and present flowing—
this is the constant principle of Heaven’s Dao.

Man’s life is but one thing among all things,
and the principle of life and death—what makes it different from other things?

To know this, why rejoice in life?
Why dread death?
Leave it to its own course,
and with boundless ease, attain great tranquility—
this is the proper way to nurture life.

If one does this,
one may delight in the Dao’s constant harmony
and roam beyond the confines of life and death.

Heaven and Earth are the *thieves* of all things;
All things are the *thieves* of man;
Man is the *thief* of all things.
Heaven and Earth are the parents of all things—
children arise from the *qi* of their parents.
Hence it is said: *Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things.*

Things steal from Heaven and Earth to be born,
plundering dew and rain to grow,
each fulfilling its own nature’s portion—
when they reach maturity and completion,
they are all fully realized.

All things steal from Heaven and Earth in this way.
Man’s life requires first the act of nurturing.
The essentials of nurturing:
nobles and commoners, rich and poor—
each should find contentment in their allotted fate.
Steal from all things to nourish life,
like how all things rely on dew and rain—
just enough is sufficient.

Do not indulge in desires beyond one’s portion,
then internally nothing is lost,
externally nothing disturbs—
body and mind at peace,
*qi* and blood in harmonious flow,
attaining Heaven’s full span,
without dying prematurely.

One may thus ascend to the marvels of deep-rooted stability,
long life, and enduring vision—
far beyond mere physical sustenance!

If one defies fate and exceeds one’s portion,
indulges in desires and gluttony,
exhausts the spirit without rest—
is this not like using the *Huìhóu’s pearl* to hunt a single yellow sparrow?
*Absurd!*

*The Scripture on Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The ancients who delighted in the Dao
ate just enough to fill their emptiness and sustain their *qi*,
clothed themselves just enough to cover their form and ward off cold—
they did not covet gain or hoard excess.
They kept their eyes clear without seeing,
ears still without hearing,
mouth closed without speaking,
mind surrendered without deliberating.
They found no joy, no suffering,
no preference, no aversion—
all things were mysteriously unified,
neither this nor that.

The three *thieves* were thus in accord,
the three *talents* were thus at peace.
*In accord* means:
Heaven and Earth delight in nurturing all things,
all things delight in completing, thriving, and multiplying,
man delights in contentment and moderation—
if the three find harmony in their accord,
then the three *talents* all attain their natural ease.

If Heaven does not rain in due time,
if Earth does not give birth to things,
then Heaven and Earth are *not in accord*.
If grains and crops do not bear fruit,
if eggs and offspring are not produced,
then all things are *not in accord*.
If one defies fate and exceeds one’s portion,
indulges in desires and greed,
internally disturbs the spirit and *qi*,
externally harms the body’s harmony,
then human nature is *not in accord*.

Learners must take what is proper,
discard what is improper—
internally attaining a tranquil mind,
externally attaining harmony in human affairs,
all things flourishing and multiplying,
calamities and misfortunes not arising—
thus delighting in the governance of great peace.

Hence it is said:
*Eat in season, and the hundred limbs will be in order.*
*Stir the mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations will be at peace.*

Food is what nourishes the body,
and its value lies in eating in season—
then the five *zàng* organs are fully harmonized,
the hundred limbs healthy and strong,
delighting in the emotions of life’s vitality,
neither deficiency nor excess will bring illness.

This concludes the discussion of the three *thieves*’ accord
and elaborates on the meaning of *stirring the mechanism*.

When a man’s mind is still and undisturbed,
clear as the boundless void,
what is there to speak of as a *mechanism*?

The moment an intention arises,
before it manifests outwardly—
this is what others do not know,
but I alone perceive—
and this I call the *mechanism*.

Man’s life, his place in the world, his conduct—
nurturing life and responding to affairs,
there are things he cannot avoid.
How can he remain undisturbed in his *mechanism*?

Yet, if he adheres to the accord of the three *thieves*,
nurtures life without exceeding his portion,
responds to affairs without seeking private gain—
when things come, though countless,
he meets them with ease, leaving no trace of attachment.
If one does this,
the root of stillness and undisturbedness—
how could it ever be troubled?

Hence it is said:
*Stir the mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations will be at peace.*
If even a trace of desire slips into the *mechanism*,
then countless threads of thought become tangled,
and he is pulled away with no time to reflect—
how could he then return to the original stillness and undisturbedness?
Even a moment’s tranquility is unattainable,
how much more so the peace of the ten thousand transformations?

What difference is there between this and starving oneself to sate hunger,
or exhausting oneself to satisfy gluttony?

Man knows his *shén* (spirit) but not the *shén* within the *shén*—
that which makes the *shén* divine.
*Shén* refers to the manifestation of the spirit seen by ghosts.
The common man does not know the true principle of life and vitality,
contentment in one’s portion, and moderation—
at every turn, his mind stirs with false intentions,
coveting what is beyond his fate,
worrying over misfortune and calamity.
He prays to ghosts and gods,
fawns for blessings beyond his due—
this is the *shén* he knows, the *shén* he worships.
But does he know the *shén* that is not *shén*—
the true source of divinity?

Moreover, my *shén*—
though seen, it has no form,
though heard, it makes no sound—
it shares virtue with Heaven and Earth,
shares luminosity with the sun and moon,
unfailing through the ages,
unaltered through life and death.
It encompasses all transformations,
a thousand changes, ten thousand variations—
using it without strain,
this is called subtle and wondrous,
this is called the utmost divinity.

Life and death are vast,
yet one cannot align with their changes—
how much less can one hope to intervene in fortune and misfortune?

When Confucius was ill,
Zǐlú requested prayers to the gods above and below.
The Master said: *My prayers have long been made.*
This is what is meant.»

The *Guān Yīn Zǐ* states: Only the Sage can be divine in divinity yet not enslaved by divinity.

The *Tōng Xuàn Jīng* says: The *heart* is the master of the body; the *shén* is the treasure of the heart.

The *Yì* says: *Shén* is that which subtly permeates all things and gives voice to them.
Swift without haste, arriving without movement.
Those who study must refine their thoughts with precision—
then they will surely attain it themselves.

The sun and moon follow their courses,
the great and small observe their numbers—
thus the Sage’s work arises, and divine luminosity emerges.
This is the proof of the refined thought and profound exploration,
and scholars must pay close attention to it.

The *sun*, the Great Yang, completes its celestial circuit in one year;
the *moon*, the Great Yin, completes its celestial circuit in one month—
this is the sun and moon following their courses.
Thirty days mark the full cycle, twenty-nine days the lesser—
this is the great and small observing their numbers.

From Winter Solstice, when one Yang first stirs,
to forty-five days later when Spring is established,
three Yang forces harmonize, and grasses and trees begin to sprout—
thus it is said: the Sage’s work arises.
Until the *Jīngdàn* (surprise, the 8th hexagram), when the Yang grows ever longer,
the Yin recedes and fades, the hexagram enters *Dà Zhuàng* (Great Strength),
and thunder begins to sound—
thus it is said: divine luminosity emerges.

Before Winter Solstice, all things return to their roots,
divine luminosity lies hidden, obscure and dim,
its form unseen.

It is likened to the utmost divinity still veiled,
stuck in darkness, as if trapped in utter Yin—
nothing can be seen, every touch is obstructed.

Yet when one observes the Sage’s work in generating life,
and steals this method for self-cultivation,
maintaining emptiness and stillness,
to seek the *shén* that is not *shén*—
but the source of divinity—
day after day, ceaselessly,
like a hen brooding her eggs,
warmth sustained without pause,
accumulating effort unbroken,
until suddenly there is an awakening—
then the One Yang returns.

The *Yì* says: *Does it not reveal the heart of Heaven and Earth?*
Once the heart is awakened,
retreat and conceal within the profound,
day and night holding fast with purity—
divine luminosity grows strong,
knowing how to employ its radiance—
this is when the Dao of the gentleman endures.
Is this not the Sage’s work arising?

When purity is held long,
the practice refined,
the *shén* becomes round and luminous,
suddenly unobstructed,
free to move in all directions,
finding ease on every side—
a realm of effortless transformation,
standing independent above all things—
is this not divine luminosity emerging?

When study reaches this point,
its effort is consummate.
One can consort with Heaven and Earth,
participate in the workings of creation,
walk upon water and fire,
command flying dragons,
roam beyond the four seas—
and enter the utmost divinity.

To steal material things for life is the lesser theft;
to steal the radiance of the seasons
to fulfill one’s cultivation—
this is the greater theft.
Thus it is further said: *Its theft of the Dao’s mechanisms.*

The theft of the Dao’s mechanisms—
no one in the world can see it, no one can know it.
The gentleman who attains it remains steadfast in poverty,
the petty man who attains it risks his life.

Though the attainment is the same,
there are gentlemen and petty men—
for their perception differs in purity and turbidity,
their practice varies in goodness and corruption.
Thus the names of gentleman and petty man are established.

The practice of goodness is to dwell content in one’s natural state,
to nourish life with moderation,
steadfastly aligning with Heaven’s harmony,
never altering to await exhaustion—
like Yán Zǐ, with one bowl of rice and one gourd of drink,
living in a humble lane,
while others could not bear his hardships,
Yán Zǐ unchanging in his joy.
This is the gentleman attaining it and remaining steadfast in poverty.

The practice of corruption is to indulge every desire,
to abandon virtue and defy righteousness,
to greedily seize without shame,
to disregard peril and destruction—
like the bandit Zhì, rampaging across the world,
strong and violent, sparing neither father nor brother,
meeting his death at Dōng Líng.
This is the petty man attaining it and risking his life.

Ah! All men share the same nature received from Heaven,
no inherent difference between gentlemen and petty men—
yet by their theft of the Dao’s mechanisms,
goodness and corruption arise,
leading to such vast separation between gentlemen and petty men.
Can one not choose wisely?

*Yellow Emperor’s Yīn Fú Jīng*, Volume on the Heart’s Method, concludes.

**Shù Tóngchuān’s Six Void Hermit Xū Yuānyī’s Annotation**
**Chapter on Overcoming Desire and Restoring the Original Command**

The blind excel in hearing; the deaf excel in sight.
Cut off the single source of desire, and the effect is tenfold that of a master’s army.
For the blind, though their eyes cannot see color,
their minds are wholly devoted to the ears—thus their hearing is acute.
For the deaf, though their ears cannot hear sound,
their minds are wholly devoted to the eyes—thus their sight is clear.

Desire is the function of ears and eyes,
the object of human craving—also desire.
A "master" refers to war.
"Tenfold" means one-tenth of ten thousand—an immense force.

Though the deaf and blind lack the advantages of ears and eyes,
they attain the abilities of keen hearing and sharp vision—
for their minds are concentrated, their wills unified.

Take the student of the Dao as one such as the deaf and blind:
with unwavering focus, they block the senses’ sharpness,
sever the root of private desire,
rendering ears and eyes empty and at ease,
the heart’s chamber still and void.
Day by day, Heaven’s principle grows dominant while human desire fades,
its efficacy surpassing even the master’s army by tenfold—
this is the initial stage of nurturing the spirit,
the threshold of entering the Way.

Yet the scholar must not rest here—
they must strive further, aiming for the utmost.

**Threefold reversal, day and night—**
a force a thousandfold greater than the master’s army.
"Three" refers to the three essentials.
"Reversal" means turning back.
"Day and night" signifies continuous, unbroken practice.

To listen is to follow sound; to see is to yield to color;
to speak is to indulge in rhetoric—
these are the pursuits the world holds dear,
yet those who spend their lives thus, never turning back—
alas, how sorrowful.

The *Classic* says:
*"Threefold reversal, day and night"*—
that is, reversing the ears’ hearing to silence,
reversing the eyes’ seeing to emptiness,
reversing the mouth’s speech to stillness.
When these three are reversed,
one essence remains alone, preserved with utmost vigilance,
day and night without pause—
human desire cannot enter, and evil *qi* cannot intrude.
With daily cultivation deepening, Heaven’s principle becomes pure and refined,
returning to the origin, restoring the original command, and returning to the root.
Compared to the master’s army’s victory,
its power is ten thousand times greater—
truly the supreme refinement of nurturing the spirit,
the ultimate attainment of the Way.

The *Canon of the Three Harmonies* states:
*"Seal the three treasures—ears, eyes, mouth—
do not let them emit.
This is how the True Person dwells in the profound abyss,
floating and guarding within the rule."*
This is what is meant.

The mind arises from things and perishes in things—
the mechanism lies in the eyes.
The eyes are the doors and windows of the body,
the foremost of the three essentials,
their function to see.
When the mind resides within them, it can perceive;
perception leads to attachment;
attachment leads to desire.
Once private desire stirs, it flows without return—
thus the mind is lost to things.

Did the ancient Perfect Ones not see things with their eyes?
Rather, when they saw things, they passed through them directly—
how could their minds perish in things?

*Laozi* says:
*"Do not see what is desirable,
so that the mind does not become disordered."*
It is not that they did not see—
but that they saw no desirability.

Zhang Zhēnrén said:
*"Seeing things is seeing the mind;
without things, the mind is unseen."*
This saying is profound—why?
For when one sees things, they see the mind;
seeing the mind means no longer seeing things.
If a person, in the act of seeing things, can perceive their own mind—
truly, the entire world is but their mind manifest,
with nothing concealed—what then is "thing"?

Heaven’s lack of favor gives rise to its greatest benevolence.
Swift thunder and violent winds move all things blindly.
All creatures, teeming and diverse, all receive from Heaven—
yet Heaven never bestows anything in return.
Heaven’s lack of favor means it does not demand repayment from all things,
yet all things spontaneously revere Heaven—
thus arises Heaven’s greatest benevolence.

Yet Heaven does not possess this benevolence;
at times, it manifests as change—
swift thunder and violent winds, shaking all things.
Heaven’s wondrous operations are all clearly displayed.
The teachings of *Yīn Fú* take observing Heaven’s Way as their essence.
This speaks of Heaven’s lack of favor,
intending for the ruler to observe it:
to love and nourish the people without calling it benevolence,
so the people till and eat, weave and clothe themselves,
settled in their homes, content in their customs—
and for those who govern the realm to observe it:
to treat the ritual vessels and the body as straw dogs,
to discard husks and seek profit,
to preserve life by transcending the body,
to forget knowledge and uphold virtue,
so that the form is whole and the essence restored,
unified with Heaven—
is this not the greatest benevolence?

As for daily actions—
seeing, hearing, joy, and anger—
these are the wondrous operations of nature,
manifesting without concealment.
How are they different from the sudden changes of thunder and wind?

Consider this:
Thunder and wind are the divine *qi* of Heaven and Earth,
the wondrous operations of yin and yang.
Before their manifestation, even spirits cannot fathom their hiding place;
when they act, swift and fierce, all things are shaken.
This is like the human spirit and *qi* in their hidden, nurtured state—
if not a single thought moves,
even Zhī Zhū and Shī Guāng could not discern their form in sight or sound.
Yet when joy and anger arise, they are evident and cannot be concealed.

If one, before a thought stirs,
possesses true faith and opens the eye of wisdom,
perceiving without doubt,
then they may know the hidden place of thunder and wind.
Moreover, in the arising of sight, hearing, joy, and anger,
they can recognize their own swift thunder and violent winds.

Great mechanisms and great operations all arrive blindly—
this is truly the *Yīn Fú* scholar’s true man.

The utmost joy is the surplus of nature;
the utmost stillness is purity.
The utmost joy is not the pleasure of wealth and comfort,
but the joy of returning to one’s true nature.
The joy of wealth and comfort is transient—
when it arrives, decay follows—
how can it be called "utmost"?

The joy of returning to nature is serene,
ever as if it had surplus—
thus it is said: *"The utmost joy is the surplus of nature."*

Consider the commoner who abandons his homeland,
leaves his kin, and drifts to a foreign land.
After long years, when he finally returns home,
seeing his parents, brothers, wife, and children,
gathered in laughter and joy—
his delight is beyond words.
How much more so the joy of returning to nature,
long lost in dust and mire, sinking in the sea of suffering,
suddenly awakening with clarity,
the burdens of the body cast off,
returning to the original beginning,
forgetting life and death, past and present—
what joy can compare?

The *Zhuangzi* says: **"The utmost joy is without joy."**
This is what it means.

As for the virtuous and pure, none excel as they do in **至静** (ultimate stillness). **至静** is when the heart has no desires—when there are no desires, then true virtue is achieved. If one has not yet attained **至静**, though he strives diligently to cleanse himself and uphold purity, his heart still harbors desires for virtue—how can he be truly virtuous?

The *Zhuangzi* says: **"To let a virtuous man guard a treasury is not as good as sealing his doors shut, for it is his lack of desires that makes him so."**

The heavens’ **至私** (ultimate intimacy) is used in **至公** (ultimate fairness).
The creatures’ nature lies in **qi** (vital breath).
The heavens’ **Dao** is silent and obscure—**至私**—yet the four seasons unfold—**至公**.
This illustrates that **tianming** (heavenly fate) and **xing** (true nature) remain **zhanji** (profoundly still and serene), as the heavens’ ultimate intimacy.
When **qi** moves, it manifests in the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, body, and mind—
as sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, thought, and reflection—
just as the four seasons unfold, without partiality or favor,
revealing the **xing**’s original **至公** (ultimate fairness).
Extend this **至公** of nature to one’s family, state, and the world—
who could fail to be fair?

Yet still, this is but the **wen** (surface expression) of **Dao**,
not its **bao** (essence).
Better is to turn inward and suddenly awaken to self-possession.
None can truly know this—
this is my **至私** (ultimate intimacy) within **至私**,
and when one attains it, the self is gone.
If the self is already gone,
how could there remain the **私** (partiality) of human emotions?

If one is thus, **性存** (true nature is preserved),
and preservation awaits **pingdeng** (equanimity).
"Honor my elders and cherish my young,
and extend this to all elders and young"—
with such **Dao**, the world can be governed in the palm of one’s hand.
Why bother extending **性**’s fairness?

As for those who do not yet grasp the heavens’ **至私** (ultimate intimacy),
nor apply **性**’s fairness,
what their hearts preserve is but **人欲** (human desires).
Few could resist indulging in **私** (partiality) and **欲** (desires),
hardening their **qi** with strength—
how could they avoid this?

The **sage** loves others and always seeks to rescue them,
so he says of **至公** (ultimate fairness): **"The creatures’ nature lies in *qi*."**
This is to encourage those who have not yet awakened,
so they may know that indulging desires and hardening *qi* harms **性** (true nature),
and must instead strive with effort to restrain and regulate,
to keep desires from moving and *qi* from becoming rigid,
returning to **虚** (emptiness),
and restoring **性** with **湛然** (profound clarity).
Is this not good?

If even a single thought of desire is not extinguished,
and a single surge of **忿** (indignation) is not still,
then **性** (true nature) is lost, **和** (harmony) is injured,
and calamity befalls oneself and one’s kin—
being enslaved by *qi* instead, whose fault is this?

Mencius said: **"Hold firm to one’s resolve, and do not vent one’s *qi*."**
The *Laozi* said: **"When the heart commands *qi*, it is called *qiang* (rigidity).
When things grow rigid, they grow old."**
This is called **"not Dao"**—
and **"not Dao"** will soon perish.

Life is the root of death,
death is the root of life.
Life is what people delight in,
death is what people abhor.
The heart strives to delight in life,
yet overindulgence in **荣养** (nourishment and honor)
harms life—so those who delight in life
are actually the root of death.
Thus it is said: **"Life is the root of death."**

A hundred thoughts of death and stillness,
**寂淡无为** (tranquil and undisturbed),
preserving **性** and safeguarding **真** (authenticity),
without harming the body—
thus those whose hearts are dead
are the foundation of true life.
Thus it is said: **"Death is the root of life."**

Long ago, **Guangchengzi** dwelled in the **Kongdong** mountains,
refining his body for a thousand two hundred years,
yet his form never decayed—
this is the **Dao** itself.

He said to the **Yellow Emperor**:
**"The essence of the ultimate *Dao* is **yao yao ming ming** (profoundly mysterious and silent).
The peak of the ultimate *Dao* is **hun hun mo mo** (dimly luminous and wordless).
Without sight or hearing,
embracing the **神** (spirit) in stillness—
the body will naturally align,
requiring only stillness and purity.
Do not exhaust your form,
do not agitate your spirit—
then the body will attain **长生** (longevity),
this is the key to preserving life."**

But in **至论** (ultimate discourse), it is otherwise:
**性** (true nature) knows no life or death—
when it emerges, it is life;
when it returns, it is death.
Why must one who lives here necessarily die there,
and only then can there be life here without death there?
How else could there be life here without death there?

Thus, this life depends on that death as its root,
and that death in turn depends on this life as its root.
Life and death alternate,
emerging and returning like a cycle without end.
Who can comprehend this—
that life and death emerge and return together,
never having been born, never having died?

To clarify this is to sever its root,
to stand alone and unchanging.
The *Zhuangzi* says:
**"Only after life emerges externally can one then attain morning clarity,
morning clarity then reveals the solitary,
the solitary then knows no ancient or modern,
and no ancient or modern then enters into *non-death, non-life*."**
Where now can one find such a person of **朝彻** (morning clarity),
to converse with him on this?

**恩** (blessing) arises from **害** (harm),
**害** arises from **恩**.
To indulge desires and prolong attachments,
the world calls it beneficial to life—
yet who knows that when desires prevail,
**天性** (heavenly nature) is extinguished,
and no greater harm exists?
Thus it is said: **"Blessing arises from harm."**

To reject desires and set aside attachments,
the world calls it detrimental to life—
yet who knows that when desires are gone,
**天性** is preserved whole,
and no greater blessing exists?
Thus it is said: **"Harm arises from blessing."**

From this perspective,
the bonds of **君臣父子** (lord and subject, parent and child),
and the gatherings of **兄弟朋友** (brothers and friends),
the interplay of blessing and harm—
how can they be fixed?

Like **阴阳** (yin and yang),
or the shifting of **晴晦** (clear and cloudy),
nothing is ever purely one without the other,
or constant without change—
only **Dao** is thus.

Those who embody **Dao** are **淡漠虚静** (serene and detached),
turning inward before life arises,
and then their joy is boundless—
what place for blessing or harm in this?

Before one attains this level,
one must still consider **得宠思辱** (gaining favor, anticipating insult),
and **居安虑危** (dwelling in ease, worrying about peril),
so as to avoid losing blessings or suffering harm.
But for the **养生君子** (noble one who cultivates life),
even in **ruanxi** (humble seating) and meals,
the interplay of blessing and harm is most acute—
how could one not be cautious?

The *Zhuangzi* says:
**"Those who love horses
fill baskets with grain and arrows,
and use gourds to collect their urine,
yet when a mosquito or gnat flies by,
they whip their attendants without restraint—
then the horses lose their bits,
their heads are injured,
and their chests are broken."**

Where the mind reaches, love is lost—
this is the meaning.

The foolish take the patterns of Heaven and Earth as sacred,
for they are without true knowing.
Those without true knowing
merely gaze upward at celestial patterns,
peer downward at terrestrial features,
delve exhaustively into classics and histories,
probe deeply into yin and yang,
believing they have mastered the Dao of the sages.
Yet who truly knows the patterns of Heaven and Earth?
The *Jing* and *Shi* are the remnants left by the sages—
traps for fish and rabbits.
They follow the currents but lose the source,
grasp the branches while abandoning the root,
spend their years without returning—
is this not folly?
Thus it is said:
*The foolish take the patterns of Heaven and Earth as sacred.*

At fifty-one, Confucius had not yet heard the Dao,
so he journeyed south to Pei and met Lao Dan.
Lao Dan said:
*"I have heard you are a sage from the north.
Have you attained the Dao?"*
Confucius replied:
*"Not yet."*
Lao Dan asked:
*"Where do you seek it?"*
Confucius said:
*"I have sought it through rites and measures
for five years, yet have not found it."*
Lao Dan asked again:
*"Where else do you seek it?"*
Confucius said:
*"I have sought it through yin and yang
for twelve years, yet have not found it."*
Lao Dan said:
*"From this, it seems Heaven’s patterns and Earth’s features,
yin and yang’s measures—
all are things that can be learned and attained.
What is not transmitted is the subtle essence,
obtained by the heart—
this is the Dao of the sages."*

Duke Huan read scriptures in the hall above.
Lun Bian carved wheels below, setting aside his mallet and axe,
and climbed up to ask:
*"May I ask what you are reading, Lord?"*
The Duke said:
*"The words of the sages."*
Lun Bian asked:
*"Are the sages still alive?"*
The Duke said:
*"They have passed away."*
Lun Bian said:
*"Then what you read are the dregs of the ancients.
How can one who craves dregs
claim to know the subtle essence of the heart?
I perceive the patterns of things in their time."*
*"The Dao is near, yet if one seeks it far,
it cannot be found.
Turn inward to seek it near—
then it is present in daily life.
In all things and affairs,
the Dao is never absent.
Yet they do not know this,
and seek the patterns of Heaven and Earth as sacred—
even if they find them,
what share do they have in the Dao?
Thus the sages extend what they know
to guide later learners,
saying: ‘I perceive the patterns of things in their time.’
‘Things in their time’ refers to what is seen in the present moment.
‘Patterns’ refers to what is felt in the present moment.
‘Wisdom’ is understanding.
Things vary in size, affairs in weight—
this is the perception of things in their time.
To respond and discern in greatness and smallness, weight and lightness—
this judgment of patterns
is not revealed by one’s innate true knowing?
The sages taught this to illuminate later generations,
so that those who ponder would awaken to their true nature,
returning to the origin and essence,
until they see the Dao alive and vibrant before them.
Ah! Is this not the way of the Yellow Emperor?
The common people live this way daily—
yet few recognize it.

If one awakens to true wisdom in responding to affairs and sensing things,
their innate true knowing is revealed—
clear and unerring—
and they may ride beside the Yellow Emperor,
ascending to the heavens and playing among the clouds.

Someone might say:
*"To speak of the Yellow Emperor’s Dao in terms of responding to affairs—
is this not crude?"*
I remained silent.
When pressed further, I said:
*"A person’s beauty or ugliness is known only through reflection—
without reflection, one does not know.
The heart’s subtlety is revealed only through sensing things—
without things, the heart remains unseen.
The sages understood the heart’s subtlety in daily life,
never to be separated for an instant.
Thus they spoke of what is close at hand,
showing the path of entry,
so that people might easily awaken in daily life—
just as one must ascend from below to reach heights,
or travel near to go far.
Why doubt this?"*

Dongguo Zi asked Zhuangzi:
*"Where is the Dao?"*
Zhuangzi replied:
*"The Dao is nowhere absent."*
Dongguo Zi said:
*"Then it must be sought deliberately."*
Zhuangzi said:
*"It is in the ant."*
Dongguo Zi said:
*"How low!"*
Zhuangzi said:
*"It is in the millet."*
Dongguo Zi said:
*"How even lower!"*
Zhuangzi said:
*"It is in the tiles and rubble."*
Dongguo Zi said:
*"How even more so!"*
Zhuangzi said:
*"It is in excrement and urine."*
Dongguo Zi sought the Dao’s location,
and Zhuangzi answered thus—
was this not the perception of things in their time?

The *Zhongyong* says:
*"The poem says:
‘The hawk flies to the heavens, the fish leaps in the depths.’
This speaks of discernment above and below.
Are not the hawk and fish things of their time?
To soar to the heavens and leap in the depths—
are these not the patterns of the hawk and fish?
Discernment above and below—
is this not the innate true wisdom of a person,
revealed in their looking up and down?
Who else but Zisi could perceive this?"*

Since the first patriarch Bodhidharma came from the West,
he established no scriptures,
but pointed directly to the human heart,
saying: *"See your nature and become a Buddha."*
Later inheritors of his transmission
interacted with the world,
guiding seekers through methods—
some shouted, some struck with a staff;
some raised a finger, some pinched the Buddha’s image;
some said: *"The green pine before the hall is true suchness,"*
some said: *"The lantern in the courtyard is the Dharma-nature."*
Some declared:
*"Brightly bright at every grass tip—
brightly bright is the Ancestor’s intent."*
Others said:
*"The verdant bamboo is all true thusness,
the yellow flowers are none other than prajña."*
Even to divine miracles—
moving water, carrying firewood—
all served to expound the essence.
Was this not the perception of things in their time?

From ancient times to now,
those who grasped this teaching are countless—
yet scholars study the theory of *things in their time and their patterns*,
but few awaken to its meaning.
Ah!
Words have their roots, affairs have their masters.
The sages used *things in their time and their patterns*
as a metaphor to reveal the subtlety of the heart’s law.
Learners must seek their own roots and masters—
do not debate whether it is *things in their time and their patterns*,
but align the Yellow Emperor’s heart with your own.

「Otherwise, the Yellow Emperor has already ascended the Dragon and departed, while the foolish merely cling to the traces of his carriage.*  Others consider me ignorant, but I do not consider myself so. *Ignorance* is but a measure.

The true wisdom reveals clarity—
to cling rigidly to doctrines and conjecture the Yellow Emperor’s Dao,
to stray from one’s own true nature—
this is the ultimate folly.
Thus it is said: *“Others consider me ignorant,”*
but *“I do not consider myself so,”*
because the Emperor taught me that daily life and spontaneous response
are all rooted in innate true wisdom,
manifesting according to principle without reliance on external learning—
how could there be any room for conjecture?
This is the most sincere and direct utterance.

Others expect the sages to be all-knowing,
but I do not seek their omniscience.
Thus it is said: *“To sink in water or enter fire is to court one’s own destruction.”*
*Sainthood* means comprehensive understanding,
*Expectation* means to meet or conform.
Others say the sages are all-knowing,
and they strain to master scriptures and doctrines,
to amass vast knowledge,
to conform to the sages’ Dao.
Thus it is said: *“Others expect the sages to be all-knowing.”*

Yet the Dao cannot be grasped through knowledge,
and knowledge cannot be recognized through recognition—
if one seeks only to accumulate vast knowledge
and conforms to the Dao of forgetting things and people,
of suddenly attaining self-awareness,
is this not a misguided path?
I do not seek their omniscience,
for the Emperor taught me that it is not through the mind’s comprehensive understanding
that one attains the Dao and becomes a sage.
*Sainthood* is merely a name given by others.
I still do not claim to possess it—
how much less their Dao?
The Dao is already a forced designation—
how much less the sages themselves?
If one seeks sainthood through the mind’s comprehension,
it is but to chase a name while abandoning reality,
to pursue trivialities while losing the essential—
like sinking in water or entering fire,
how could one not perish?
Thus it is said: *“How much less water entering fire, courting destruction.”*
Water and fire are inherently beneficial to humanity,
yet their harm comes from humans thrusting themselves into them—
this is not the fault of water and fire, is it?

Scriptures are the sages’ legacy,
left to awaken those not yet awakened—
yet later learners, enamored of their words,
oblivious to their substance?
Recognizing the coarse while losing the refined?
Exhausting their intellects,
consuming their knowledge,
studying tirelessly day and night,
only to gain empty discourse,
their intent to surpass others and seek fame and fortune,
to feign sincerity and practice deceit,
to extinguish true principle—
is this not the same as courting destruction?
If one can truly learn for oneself,
and exhaust the principles within scriptures to realize one’s nature,
what more could the sages add?
If so, then why abandon the scriptures and histories?

The Dao of Nature is still—
thus all things under Heaven are born.
The Dao of Heaven and Earth is permeating—
thus Yin and Yang prevail.
Yin and Yang, pushing and yielding,
generate harmonious transformation.
The stillness of Nature is the foundation of the Dao.
Motion produces Heaven and Earth,
divides Yin and Yang,
pushing and swaying to generate the Five Phases,
transforming all things—
endless without cessation.
Who sustains this?
It is the Dao of Nature.
The *West Ascension Classic* says:
*“Nature gives birth to the Dao,
the Dao gives birth to the One,
the One gives birth to the Two,
the Two gives birth to the Three,
the Three gives birth to all things.”*
The *Yijing* says:
*“The Yijing has the Supreme Ultimate,
which generates the Two Principles,
the Two Principles generate the Four Symbols,
the Four Symbols generate the Eight Trigrams,
the Eight Trigrams determine auspiciousness and inauspiciousness.”*
When the sages speak of this,
does their teaching depend on words?

Indeed, human nature is also like this.
Let me explain:
The *Guan Yinzi* says:
*“Nature is the heart before its arising.
Before the heart’s arising, it is still—
in harmony with the Dao of Nature.”*
When the heart moves,
all dharmas arise simultaneously.
From the vast—Heaven and Earth—
to the minute—motes of dust,
squares, circles, straight, and curved—
all transform and manifest,
without end or limit.
This must be self-attested;
only then can one exhaust principles and realize nature,
and complete the task of sagely learning.
If self-attestation is even slightly lacking,
then there is doubt—
even the sages cannot help this.

Thus the sages know the Dao of Nature cannot be defied,
and they establish teachings, rites, and laws accordingly.
The Dao of utmost stillness
cannot be measured by calendrical or musical systems.
*Calendrical* refers to the harmonization of Yin and Yang,
*Musical* is the art of calculation.
How do the sages surpass others?
They know that Heaven and Earth have the Dao of Nature,
humans have innate Nature,
and things have their natural functions—
all cannot be separated.
Thus they set forth teachings, established rites, and created laws,
transmitted through the ages,
to ensure that rulers and subjects, fathers and sons,
brothers, husbands, and wives
do not lose their proper order,
that all things do not lose their natural functions,
and that all may align with their true nature,
preserving the Great Harmony—
not artificially contrived,
but naturally so.
The Dao of utmost stillness is the Dao of Nature itself.
Silent and scentless,
it cannot be seen with the eyes or heard with the ears—
only those with sincere clarity and tacit understanding grasp it.
How could calendrical or musical systems measure this?

There exists a wondrous instrument,
from which all phenomena arise.
The Eight Trigrams, the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches,
divine and inscrutable mechanisms.
The art of Yin and Yang’s mutual victory
is clearly revealed in the symbols.
The *wondrous instrument* is another name for Nature’s Dao,
for the Supreme Ultimate,
for the human heart—
Zhuangzi called it *self-so-unique*.
The Eight Trigrams, Heavenly Stems, Earthly Branches,
all flow from this wondrous instrument,
thus it is said:
*“There exists a wondrous instrument,
from which all phenomena arise.”*
The sages renamed and taught this
so that later learners might govern superficial knowledge
while attaining the root,
and reverse the flow to return to the origin.
If one can observe the Eight Trigrams,
Heavenly Stems, Earthly Branches,
and all phenomena,
without forming other perceptions,
and directly comprehend their essence,
then the wondrous instrument is attained.
Otherwise, if one exhaustively examines
the Eight Trigrams, Heavenly Stems, Earthly Branches,
and their omens,
but fails to grasp it,
then it is but fortune.
*Divine and inscrutable mechanisms* refers to the wondrous instrument’s marvelous functions.
Indeed, the *divine* is the unfathomable interplay of Yin and Yang,
the *inscrutable* is what sight and hearing cannot discern—
how much more so its mechanisms and depths?
It is but an exaltation of the wondrous instrument’s functions,
so profound and mysterious,
so difficult to measure or see.»

Yin and Yang—this refers to movement and stillness.
The art of mutual conquest is simply mutual pushing;
when they push against each other, victory and defeat become apparent.
When Yin conquers Yang, it leans toward stillness;
when Yang conquers Yin, it leans toward movement.
Balance in the middle is harmony.
If movement aligns with this balance, there is no venture that does not succeed;
if movement strays from it, there is no venture that does not bring misfortune.
Movement—here lie the threads of calamity and fortune, of life and death.
Though this principle is profound and mysterious,
difficult to measure or perceive,
its motion is as clear as the sun’s ascent—
all phenomena under Heaven are illuminated by it.
Thus it is said:
*"Shining forth, it ascends into the realm of phenomena."*
*Ascend* means to rise.
The Sage’s final admonition to humanity is to be cautious in movement.

If one, before taking action, clearly understands the wondrous instrument,
and proceeds with affairs as a mirror reflects form or the moon prints upon water,
then not only will there be no fault in human affairs,
but one will also perceive one’s true nature.
True wisdom, luminous and unobscured by movement,
only then fulfills the Sage’s teaching.

Yet still—
though I have spoken exhaustively of Qingcheng’s finest truths,
one must climb the heights to truly know them.
*The Yellow Emperor’s Heart Method of the Yin Symbol Classic, Lower Scroll, ends here.*
