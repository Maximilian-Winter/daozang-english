At that time, the Most High Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning—
*"Primordial Beginning"* refers to the *Primordial Ancestral Qi*. The *Primordial Ancestral Qi* gives rise to all heavens, akin to what the Buddhist teachings call the *Supreme Dao* or the *Immovable Revered One*, hence the title *Heavenly Worthy*—
resided within the Forest of Seven Treasures.
Man’s body possesses the Three Origins and Four Images in full, thus called the *Forest of Seven Treasures*.
In the Palace of Fivefold Luminosity—
This is the inner realm of the Yellow Court within the Central Palace, where emptiness and clarity universally illumine, hence the *Palace of Fivefold Luminosity*—
accompanied by the Sacred Assembly of the Boundless.
This signifies all manner of transformations.
He emitted boundless radiance—
This signifies all manner of knowledge and insight—
illuminating the boundless worlds.
This signifies all manner of realms.
He beheld the boundless sentient beings—
This signifies all manner of illusions and delusions—
suffering boundless afflictions.
This signifies all manner of entanglements and fetters.
They drift and turn within the world,
Exchanging shells and shifting forms without end.
Revolving through the cycles of birth and death,
Emerging into life and entering death, unaware of their own awakening.
Adrift upon the River of Love—
The River of Love’s waves are vast; those tossed about are bound by karmic ties of emotion.
Swept along in the Sea of Desire—
The Sea of Desire’s depths are profound; those drowning are ensnared by clinging and attachment.
Mired in sound and form—
Bewildered by form and sound, this is called *karmic consciousness*.
Deluded by existence and non-existence.
Shifting between being and non-being, this is called *root and dust*.
Non-emptiness and emptiness—
Non-emptiness is not true emptiness; emptiness that exists is illusory emptiness.
Formlessness and form—
Formlessness is not true form; form that exists is illusory form.
Non-nothingness and nothingness—
Non-nothingness is not true nothingness; nothingness that exists is illusory nothingness.
Existence and non-existence—
Existence that exists is not true existence; non-existence that exists is illusory existence.
From beginning to end, shrouded in darkness—
To cling to one side is to remain benighted.
Unable to illuminate themselves—
To cling to no side is to remain ultimately unenlightened.
Utterly lost in delusion.
These four delusions confound one’s entire life without resolution.

**This concludes the first chapter.**
*Herein lies the meaning of the scripture’s exposition.*

All sentient beings dwell within the differentiated realms of existence, non-existence, form, formlessness, and emptiness. Therefore, the Heavenly Worthy, in his compassion, expounded this scripture, employing manifold expedient means. His intent was to enable beings to cultivate true awakening through this illusory body, hence the metaphors of the Seven Treasures and the Fivefold Luminosity.

If one seeks to preserve the spirit with jade talismans and refine the body with golden elixirs, one must first abide in the *Primordial Ancestral Qi*, then regulate all manner of karmic conditions. Only thus can one shatter all differentiations, depart from all realms, sever all illusions, and dissolve all fetters. Thereby, one is no longer afflicted by the sufferings of love and desire and is forever freed from the wheel of rebirth. Those who attain this vision have grasped the Dao of longevity and enduring vision.

The Heavenly Worthy proclaimed:
*Herein lies the reiteration of this teaching.*

All you sentient beings—all beings arise from illusion. From non-being comes being; all that bears form is fundamentally non-being. From non-non-being comes non-being; all that is formless is fundamentally not non-being. From non-color comes color; all that appears colored is fundamentally not color. From non-emptiness comes emptiness; all that appears empty is fundamentally not emptiness.

Not-being taken as being—clinging to being as being—is not true being. Non-non-being taken as non-being—clinging to non-being as non-being—is not true non-being. Non-color taken as color—perceiving color as color—is not true color. Non-emptiness taken as emptiness—deluded by emptiness as emptiness—is not true emptiness.

Emptiness as emptiness—emptiness grasped as emptiness—is mere stagnant emptiness. Emptiness has no fixed emptiness; how could emptiness possess a fixed essence? Color as color—color grasped as color—is illusory color. Color has no fixed color; how could color possess a fixed essence?

That color is emptiness—color is not different from emptiness. That emptiness is color—emptiness is not different from color. If one can know that emptiness is not emptiness, that the non-empty is emptiness—this is called true emptiness. To know that color is not color, that the non-colored is color—this is called true color.

This is called *illuminating clarity*: when color and emptiness are seen as one, when being and non-being are understood as non-dual, one first attains the *wondrous sound*. To hear what is unheard—this is called the wondrous sound. To recognize the Dharma of emptiness—where emptiness is not emptied—this is called the Dharma of emptiness.

To perceive without obstruction—where being and non-being are non-dual—is the gateway of unimpeded vision. To enter the gate of manifold wonders—where color and emptiness are as one—is the gateway of manifold wonders. Naturally, one awakens: without clinging to being or non-being, the mind-nature becomes vast and open. Free from the net of doubts—where color and emptiness are not seen—all doubt dissolves. Without clinging to the view of emptiness—where there is no eye-realm up to no mind-consciousness-realm—one purifies the six senses. Without form, sound, scent, taste, touch, or Dharma—one severs perverse obstructions. Without form, feeling, perception, volition, or consciousness.

The preceding two chapters elucidate the heart-method of Ascending the Mystery. Out of compassion, the Heavenly Worthy directly points to the essential purport of being and non-being, color and emptiness, repeatedly admonishing with earnest exhortation. His intent is to enable beings to depart from all differentiated realms and abide neither in being nor non-being nor the view of emptiness. Herein lies the subtlest essence of Ascending the Mystery—it is fully expounded.

For the noble adept who cultivates the truth: if one possesses the single eye to perceive this, the work of spiritual inquiry is complete. Should this not yet be so, listen carefully to the final words. Thus, I expound for you this wondrous sutra, its meaning as explained above. It is named *The Scripture of Safeguarding Life*.

The Way of Longevity and Enduring Vision delivers and liberates all beings—those who place faith in it shall not suffer defilement or disgrace. When carried as a personal offering, preserved within, form endures and life is prolonged. When transmitted through the world and bestowed outwardly, it benefits humans and devas. Through its circulation and recitation, those who chant it are shielded from calamity and upheld in decline.

Then there are the Flying Heavenly Kings, the Demolishing-Delusion Vajras, the Dharma-Protecting Divine Youths, the Salvation-from-Suffering Perfected Ones, and the Golden-Essence Fierce Beasts—each in hundreds of millions of hosts—all attending this scripture, following wherever it is guarded. Wherever this scripture resides, the Ten Heavenly Benevolent Deities surround and protect it. As the Buddhist sutras say: where this scripture abides, it is as if a Buddha’s stupa or temple were present.

Shielding from calamity and upholding in decline—this is called the medicinal stone of life-extension. Delivering all beings—this is called the bridge of salvation. Departing from all attachments—this is called the dharma-rain that washes away dust.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke in verse, once more proclaiming the wondrous meaning:

"Though sight may not perceive Me..."

"Be ever vigilant where sight perceives not, ever attentive where hearing discerns not, ever wary where sound reaches not. Departing from all extremes, the noble one thus remains ever watchful in solitude—this is called the wondrous Dao.

The Dao of Ascending the Mysterious is here made complete.

Above are three chapters.
They expound the merits of upholding this scripture through parable and exhortation. Earlier, the four destinies of form, formlessness, emptiness, and the true were set forth as the steps of Ascending the Mysterious, the bridge of salvation. Yet fearing some may lack the strength, these chapters further employ manifold dharmic forms to guide those of middling or lesser capacity, inspiring reverence, faith, and devotion, that they may recite its words and seek its meaning, gradually entering the sublime.

Again, four verses are spoken to directly point to the mysterious essence, desiring that both humans and non-humans alike ascend to the realm of the Mysterious.

Thus is the virtue of the Most High’s love for life made manifest—truly, it is perfect. Without single-minded resolve and vigorous practice, one cannot repay this profound grace. Those who dwell in hermitages between scriptures should redouble their efforts.

*Commentary on the Wondrous Scripture of the Most High’s Ascending the Mysterious, Eliminating Disaster, and Protecting Life* is here concluded."
