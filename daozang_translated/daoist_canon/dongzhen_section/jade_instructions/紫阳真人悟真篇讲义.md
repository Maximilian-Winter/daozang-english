**Preface to the *Lecture Notes on the *Awakening to Reality* by the Perfected One of Purple Yang**

The Perfected One of Tiantai, Zhang Pingshu, composed over a hundred poems titled *Awakening to Reality*, which have circulated in the world. Those with discernment say that since the *Triple Concordance*, no work has matched this one.

Though I have dabbled in such studies during my leisure, I have yet to grasp its subtleties. Xia Zongyu of Yunfeng, having traveled from Yongjia to wander among the curtains of Manting, presented me with his *Lecture Notes on the *Awakening to Reality***. Through meticulous chapter divisions and line-by-line analysis, reading it dispels all doubts with clarity.

Yet, as I have just secluded myself and declined visitors, I cannot follow him to inquire at length and exhaust its wonders. Still, judging by his character—his talent and intelligence forthright and towering—he has served in the military headquarters of Shandong, carrying official dispatches through Yan and Qi, his ambitions for merit and fame keen indeed.

At not yet fifty years of age, you now contemplate casting aside official cap and carriage to wander the vast seas and mountains with Anqi and Xianmen—this is a plan far too premature. I have lately heard Daoist teachings that attaining immortality is most difficult, save for those of utmost loyalty and filial piety, who may achieve it without cultivation. Though such claims seem remote and elusive, beyond easy comprehension, if celestial immortals truly exist, they must surely be those who were loyal ministers and filial sons—such attainment cannot be left to chance. With your talents, even if you do not seek to serve the world, the world will not leave you idle. Strive to establish merit in this enlightened age, repay the state and honor your family, fulfilling both loyalty and filial piety. Only then may you follow your remote ancestor, Xia Huanggong, to roam the orchards of Mount Shang—nothing will be beyond you.

You have also authored *Lecture Notes on the Yinfu Jing* and other works, which remain at Maogang Tower. Cishu has already written a preface for them, so I shall say no more.

Written on the third day after the Winter Solstice in the third year of the Baoqing era by Zhen Dexiu of Jian’an.

Among the many scholars of my homeland renowned for classical learning and literary ambition, none has yet been able to transmit the oral instructions of Zhang Pingshu’s *Awakening to Reality*. Yet Master Xia Zongyu alone, through secret transmission and seated instruction, has advanced in this Way—this is indeed extraordinary. From youth, he harbored lofty aspirations, believing merit and fame could be attained with ease. Over the past twenty years, he has studied under Masters Ying, Jia, and Xu, and shared hardships with Gou Mengyu in the military headquarters, traversing Qing and Qi, crossing the Taihang Mountains, and venturing deep into Tartar territory, enduring extreme toil and exhaustion. Later, his circumstances diverged from his wishes, and he withdrew from worldly affairs, ceasing even to speak of them. He composed three works—*The Mirror of Medicines*, *Lecture Notes on the Yinfu Jing*, and *Lecture Notes on the Awakening to Reality*—to which Daoist adepts have even sworn oaths to become his disciples.

I have long admired those of ancient times who, having achieved merit and renown, retired like Fan Li to the Five Lakes or roamed with Master Red Pine, yet left not a single word behind. Might you now be burdened by your own writings? He replied: “I am no one who seeks to soar high and withdraw far. My aspirations will only be fulfilled when all people of later ages can reverse aging and return to youth, transcending the ordinary to enter the wondrous. Why should I惜 words?” This discourse is especially profound—worthy of reverence and admiration.

Written in the early spring of the first year of the Shaoding era by Cao Shuyuan, Minor Supervisor of the Secretariat, of Yongjia.

How can the Way be anything but rooted in one’s own body? The elixir of longevity and immortality—who could find it outside oneself? Kan and Li, Zhen and Dui—these are the elements of my body. Metal and Wood, Water and Fire—these are the elements of my body. Interlocking pears and fiery jujubes—these are the essences of my body. Nectar and jade liquor—these are the vital fluids of my body. Though a thousand forms and ten thousand shapes arise, none lie beyond this body. Yet ordinary people, though they know methods to preserve and protect it, cannot master its transformations. Only the perfected possess the art of inversion and reversal. Thus, they guard the true and embrace the One: the dragon emerges from fire, the tiger is born in water. Without inversion and reversal, how can the Way be accomplished? The seven returns and nine reversions—these are the wondrous grades. The eight reunions and six residences—these are the divine grades. Zhang Pingshu knew this; Xia Zongyu knows this; the Old Man of Shouzhang gazes in awe and sighs.

Written on an auspicious day in the first month of winter in the first year of the Shaoding era by Zhang Mizi, Gentleman of the Secretariat, of Siming.

**Lecture Notes on the Awakening to Reality by the Perfected of Purple Yang, Volume One**
By Xia Zongyu, the Cloud Peak Recluse of Yongjia.

Sixteen quatrains in heptasyllabic verse,
Their number mirroring the sixteen ounces of a catty.

Who seeks not the Great Dao strays from the path,
Though burdened with talent, how can one be a true man?
A hundred years of life flicker like sparks from stone,
A lifetime’s existence floats like bubbles on water.
Only craving rank and wealth for glory and fame,
Heedless of one’s form withering unseen.
Try asking if gold piled high as mountains
Can buy back what impermanence denies.

*The Assembly of Perfected on Western Mountain* states:
"Fame and profit must be sought, yet each has its destined measure—
Those who see through this are free from entanglement.
Affection and love must be cultivated, yet their karma is self-wrought—
Those who see through this are free from attachment.
Moreover, a human life spans a hundred years, yet seventy is rare.
Like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows—nothing is fixed or sure.
The deluded know only rank, wealth, and glory,
Piling gold and jade, believing in eternal enjoyment.
Yet unaware that form withers unseen,
And impermanence cannot be bought—
In the sudden moment like morning dew,
What use are rank, gold, or jade to me?

Only the Great Dao is constant,
Transcending the realm of things,
Neither born nor destroyed,
Neither coming nor going.
While in the world, it regards all things without attachment.
When weary of the world, it abides in the Dao to nurture the spirit.
Wealth cannot defile,
Gold and jade cannot taint,
Time cannot age,
Impermanence cannot approach—
Is this not the true man?

Otherwise, why would the ancient sages say,
‘Immortality can be learned,
Deathlessness can be attained through effort’?

Though a human life may span a hundred years,
Longevity or early death, poverty or success—none can be foreknown.
Yesterday, one rode through the streets on horseback;
Today, one lies in a coffin as a sleeping corpse.
Wife and wealth, abandoned, are no longer yours,
While karmic deeds follow—who can deceive themselves?
If the Great Elixir is not sought, how can one encounter it?
And if encountered yet not refined, how foolish is that?

Life and death, day and night—such is the natural order.
Yet if one holds to the Dao, though dead, one yet lives—
How much more so for the immortals, who attain deathless life?
Thus, ‘Hearing the Dao in the morning, one may die by evening.’
This does not mean that hearing the Dao hastens death,
But that even in death, one yet lives.
‘Corpse-liberation and ascension’ describe their transformations—
For immortals can exit death and enter life.

The deluded, unaware, chase after the fields of desire,
Uncertain of the morrow, abandoning wife and wealth,
With karmic deeds clinging to them—
Pingshu deeply pities them.
If one but knows this, one must seek the Great Elixir to avoid such an end.
Yet this elixir is not sought externally—
It is said that everyone possesses the elixir of long life,
But without a teacher to point it out, it remains hidden.
Even if one meets a teacher yet fails to cultivate,
The spark-like span of life swiftly passes through birth, aging, sickness, and death—
How foolish is that?

This method is true within the true, wondrous within the wondrous,
All because I alone differ from others.
I know the inversion arises from *li* and *kan*,
But who recognizes the floating and sinking to determine host and guest?
The golden crucible seeks to retain cinnabar-clad mercury,
The jade pool first receives silver from the water.
The divine work of firing is not a full day’s labor—
A single wheel of the sun emerges from the deep pool.

The poems of *Awakening to Reality* serve as the Supreme Lord’s proclamation of the secret principles of the Golden Elixir.
Yet the first two chapters merely exhort the world—
In truth, this chapter marks the beginning of profound discourse.
How many commentators have sought to explain it,
Yet none have fully elucidated its depths.
How then to guide later learners?
There is no other way:
Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,
Without a true teacher, do not force guesses.

The wonder within the true, the true within the wonder—
Scholars take these as mere metaphors for the Great Dao,
Unaware that the profound mysteries of the Golden Elixir
Precisely distinguish the true from the ordinary.
Those who attain the true harmonize their virtue with heaven and earth.
Those who master the wondrous remain unknown even to ghosts and spirits.
But if one falls into the ordinary,
One strays from the Dao and harms life.

*Master Yunfang* said:
"A trifling celestial mechanism speaks of *qi* and essence—
Beyond this true, there is no true."
*The Mirror of Medicines* said:
"Following conditions, one attains the utmost true,
Which can manifest and transform, penetrating the divine."

Thus, Pingshu earnestly instructs on the distinction between true and ordinary.
He says, "If you do not recognize the true lead as the primal ancestor,"
And, "Diligently seek the true lead."
He says, "If you wish to retain mercury with true lead,"
And, "Within, there is the natural true fire."
As for "using lead yet not using ordinary lead,
And having used true lead, discarding it"—
All this is to make one distinguish the difference between true and ordinary,
For this is the foundation of understanding the Dao,
The gateway to refining the Golden Elixir—
How can one neglect it without reflection?

Moreover, *li* (☲) is the south, noon—yang, fire.
*Kan* (☵) is the north, midnight—yin, water.
Yang fire flames upward, yin water moistens downward,
Above and below, as if deaf and uncommunicative, never uniting.
Yet within *li*, one line is even—an image of outer yang and inner yin.
Thus, yin carries yang and tends downward,
Yin descends, and yang descends with it.
Within *kan*, one line is odd—an image of outer yin and inner yang.
Thus, yang carries yin and rushes upward,
Yang ascends, and yin ascends with it.
Though this describes the ascent and descent of yin and yang,
It is not the method of inverting *kan* and *li*.
The world clings to this,
Often taking the heart as *li* and the kidneys as *kan*,
Making heart and kidneys unite,
Water and fire harmonize,
And clinging to this as the work of the Golden Elixir—
This is not so. It is merely the method of peace and joy.

For the heart and kidneys have form and substance,
Waxing and waning—
How can they be the Dao?
Only the immortals can empty *kan* and fill *li*,
Employing the method of inversion.

Why?
Before the Supreme Ultimate divided,
There was a thing, undifferentiated—
What was *li*, what was *kan*?
From "Heaven generates one, water,"
"Earth generates two, fire"—
Only after water and fire separated were *kan* and *li* delineated.
Thus, two yin embrace one yang to form *kan* (☵).
*Kan* is full, its outer image water,
Yet within it, yang fire is born.
The immortals must refine this yang to empty its center,
Raising its fire for the work of the Golden Elixir.

Two yang embrace one yin to form *li* (☲). *Li* is hollow at its center, its outer image fire, yet within it, yin water is born. The immortals must refine this yin to fill its center, uniting its lines to form a body of pure yang. Thus, when *kan* is emptied, it becomes *kun* (☷); when *li* is filled, it becomes *qian* (☰). This is the transformation of the Qian Dao, each rectifying its nature and destiny—taking the fullness from the *kan* position in the heart and infusing it into the yin within the *li* palace of the abdomen. As for the heart and kidneys uniting, water and fire harmonizing—what does this have to do with the matter?

As for the theories of floating and sinking, guest and host, they are no mere allegories. Within the human body, there is a thing: one floats, one sinks; one is guest, one is host. The qi and vessels communicate subtly without interruption. Should the sinking one suffer loss, the floating one also suffers. If the host is deficient, the guest is likewise deficient. Thus, to retain cinnabar mercury in the golden crucible, one must first deposit liquid mercury in the jade pool—then the root flourishes and the branches thrive, the source runs deep and the flow endures.

Yet mercury and lead cannot transform themselves; they must rely on the fire of divine skill, drawn and added in operation, before the mysterious pearl takes form and the radiant red elixir is completed. This is achieved in less than a morning, and the Dao-fruit is perfected.

Master Haichan said: *"Sink to the ocean’s depths, and embrace the rising sun."* Is this not the manifestation of the solar wheel in the deep pool?

Attaining the Dao in this way, I truly differ from others. This chapter reveals the marrow of the Golden Elixir and discloses the celestial mechanism. If scholars can grasp the meaning through the text, then the Dao is present before their eyes—no need for the three thousand six hundred gates.

Tiger leaps, dragon soars—waves surge rough,
At the central true position, the luminous pearl is born.
Though fruit on branches may ripen in time,
How is the child in the womb different?

North and South sects invert the hexagrams’ images,
Morning and evening fire-timing aligns with the celestial pivot.
Know that great reclusion dwells in the marketplace—
Do not seek solitude in the deep mountains.

The dragon is a yang thing; the tiger, a yin thing. Their union, symbolized by dragon and tiger, yields the mysterious pearl in a moment’s work at the true position. The true position is the place where the yellow center penetrates principle. It is like fruit growing on branches or a child in the womb—when the qi-cycles of the celestial circuit are complete, it naturally matures. The North and South sects’ inversion of hexagrams is precisely the earlier principle of inverting *kan* and *li*. Dao Guang said: *"Face south to observe the Northern Dipper, and within stillness gather true lead."* Morning and evening fire-timing aligns with the celestial pivot, as in *"morning Layering, evening Ignorance"*—harmonizing with Heaven and Earth’s virtue, all following natural timing, not confined to sitting in vigil on *gengshen* nights or exhaling and inhaling at *zi* and *wu* hours.

Those who attain this Dao are neither noble nor base, neither in the marketplace nor the mountains. If a determined scholar can cultivate this, there is no harm in dwelling in the city or serving at court.

True Man Wang Ding said: *"Kan-tiger, Li-dragon, tortoise essence, phoenix marrow—knowing you have awakened to the elixir’s origin, the wind-lamp is hard to preserve. Best to advance in cultivation now. It does not lie in visualizing heart and kidneys, nor in sitting alone in the cliffs. Do you understand, sir? The medicine is before your eyes, rising and sinking from dawn to dusk. If you can grasp even a little of the yang essence, the subtlety requires no further seeking."*

May the winding river be clear and still, the divine water flow westward. Let metal and wood not be obstructed, and may the yang hun and yin po unite. Within the primordial chaos, a radiant red sun shines—gather it in the crucible.

Yellow sprouts and white snow are not hard to find,
But the distant seeker must rely on deep virtue.
The Four Symbols and Five Phases depend entirely on earth;
The Three Primes and Eight Trigrams how could they leave *ren*?

Refining the numinous essence, it becomes hard to recognize;
Dissolving all yin demons, ghosts cannot invade.
Wishing to leave this secret formula among humankind,
Yet not a single soul is found to be a knowing friend.

The Yellow Sprout and White Snow are the supreme nine-grade elixir of the ancient sages, refined from the essence of the Primordial Lord’s Wood through the crucible of water and fire. With no regard for years or months, through prolonged refinement and nurturing, its radiant essence naturally coalesces into auspiciousness, transcending the vulgar qualities of cinnabar and mercury. This may be called "from nonbeing into being, from the mortal into the sacred." Ingesting it transforms one’s form and renews the bones, allowing ascent to the heavens—how could the world recognize such a treasure?

Within the inner elixir of the human body, these two treasures also exist. Yet those of shallow virtue and meager merit, who feel shame in their every movement, can scarcely attain them. Thus, Master Pingshu exhorted those who seek the Dao to cultivate yin merits and yang virtues, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, while also pointing to the path where these treasures are not hard to find: the Four Symbols and Five Phases all depend on Earth, and the Three Primes and Eight Trigrams cannot depart from *ren*. Is this not because Earth gives birth to the Yellow Sprout and *ren* gives birth to White Snow?

Earth resides at the center, its color yellow. Without Earth, the Wood of the Azure Dragon, the Metal of the White Tiger, the Fire of the Vermilion Bird, and the Water of the Dark Warrior cannot fulfill their transformations. Thus, Earth is the master of the Five Phases, nurturing all things. As Immortal Lü said: "When thunder shakes and rain falls upon the mountain’s peak, it gradually waters the Yellow Sprout as it emerges from the soil." *Ren* occupies the position of Water, generated by Metal, its color white and its qi cold. Whether the Three Primes of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, or the Eight Trigrams of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, *Xun*, *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui*, none can depart from the Water of *ren*. Water is the mother of the Golden Elixir, and *ren* is the inception of the child—this is the moment when the first yang stirs to form the elixir. An ancient song says: "To cultivate the Dao, seek the mystery in the Water Palace; when the empty chamber generates whiteness, White Snow arises naturally from *ren*."

Those who refine this numinous treasure dissolve all yin demons, and though it is not passed even from father to son, how could the uninitiated recognize it? Profound and unfathomable, it remains inviolable even to ghosts. Yet while some hear that Earth gives birth to the Yellow Sprout and assume it refers to the spleen as central Earth, or that *ren* gives birth to White Snow and take it to mean the kidneys as the Water of *ren*, they fail to realize that the spleen and kidneys are tangible substances—just as cinnabar and mercury are tangible compounds—how could they serve as agents of transformation? The adept refining the elixir must not cling to the spleen and kidneys within, nor abandon mercury and cinnabar without. Know that the Yellow Sprout and White Snow emerge beyond form and substance, existing as "nonbeing within being, being within nonbeing," a mystery within mystery, a wonder beyond wonder—unfathomable and inconceivable.

The worldly vie for fame and profit, indulging in debauchery, wine, and lust. Even minor practices of ease and joy are neglected, so how could they seek the great Dao’s confidants or the secret formulas of the Golden Elixir? It is a sorrowful difficulty indeed. Every person possesses the medicine of immortality, yet in their folly, they cast it aside. Sweet dew descends only when Heaven and Earth unite; the Yellow Sprout grows only when *Kan* and *Li* intersect. The frog in the well leaps but a few inches in its shallow pool, the sparrow in the hedge flits low among the weeds—how could they know of the dragon’s palace beneath the vast sea or the phoenix’s nest in the towering forests? When the medicine ripens, gold naturally fills the house—why seek herbs to burn as straw?

Heaven and Earth unite their essences to generate all things; man and woman unite their essences to generate humanity. In their ceaseless transformations, from root to origin, there is neither immortal nor mortal, neither noble nor base—all receive a single spark of true yang qi. Thus, the Three Powers stand together, and one may dwell in the world forever. Yet humanity, adrift in the rivers of desire and seas of lust, squanders the essence at the tailbone day and night, indulging in fleeting pleasures without restraint. How pitiful their ignorance, wasting a century’s cultivation of the true! Thus, Master Pingshu took pity on them, saying that the medicine of longevity exists within the human body—sweet dew and the Yellow Sprout are its very substance.

When the qi of Heaven descends and the qi of Earth ascends, their harmonious vapors steam together, and sweet dew descends. *Li* receives the Earth of *wu*, *Kan* receives the Earth of *ji*; water and fire circulate and meet at the central Yellow position, and the Yellow Sprout grows. This is no external matter, yet when lesser men hear of the Dao, they surely laugh. Like the frog leaping in a ladle of water or the sparrow flitting low among the weeds, how could they know of the dragon’s palace in the deep sea or the phoenix’s nest in the towering forests? It is not worth reproaching them.

Only the man of the Dao refines this great medicine, drinking sweet dew in due season and daily gathering the Yellow Sprout. Through the regulation of fire and the addition of time, when the celestial cycles are complete, yang is restored and the bones are renewed. Divine radiance manifests, the golden countenance becomes majestic, and one unites with the Dao in truth. As the Perfected of Yin said: "When you reach the place of the Yellow Sprout, gold fills my house." Why seek herbs to burn as straw to transform external crucible substances?

Diligently seek true lead, lest time slip away too easily.
Capture the Earth’s *po* to subdue vermilion mercury,
And you will see the Heaven’s *hun* restrain Water-Metal.
This may be called: "The Dao is lofty, and dragons and tigers submit;
Virtue is weighty, and ghosts and spirits revere it."
Once you know longevity equals Heaven and Earth,
No vexations will ever trouble the heart again.

The great Dao of the Golden Elixir arises from nothing more than lead and mercury, yet no one in the world understands this—why? The Most High said: "Take lead as the lord, mercury as the minister." If lead is not true, mercury will not draw near. An ancient song says: "Only fear that lead is not true; if lead is true, the medicine forms itself." The world often takes lead to be the single spark of yang essence in the northern true qi, yet they do not realize that within it, there is both the true and the vulgar. The true harmonizes virtue with Heaven and Earth; the vulgar shares its conduct with swine and dogs. Moreover, though lead and mercury are distinct, their root is one. Lead gives birth to mercury, and mercury in turn gives birth to lead—this is the sevenfold reversal of the returning elixir.

Without diligent inquiry, seeking teachers and visiting friends, and obtaining the golden needle to scrape away the film, one will indeed fritter away life in the fleeting spark of a flint, trapped in birth, aging, sickness, and death. If one knows this, then by mutually restraining the Heaven’s *hun*, Earth’s *po*, golden lead, and fiery mercury, the cultivation of virtue and power becomes possible.

For the *hun* of Heaven is yang, the sun, fire, and mercury; the *po* of Earth is yin, the moon, water, and lead—all are merely alternate names for lead and mercury.

Yet when Earth’s *po* seizes and restrains fiery mercury, this is yin’s power to control yang. When Heaven’s *hun* subdues watery lead, this is yang’s power to master yin. The alternation of one yin and one yang—this is the Dao; the union of sun and moon—this is the elixir. Then how could the Dao fail to ascend, how could virtue fail to deepen? Though the hidden and the manifest differ in kind, one may yet subdue dragon and tiger, command ghosts and spirits. Thus may one’s lifespan equal Heaven and Earth, transcend the realm of things—what care then for the vexations of the dusty world?

Cease refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits; to seek among the myriad herbs is even further from the truth. When yin and yang find their kindred and return to mutual resonance, when the two eights stand in perfect balance, they naturally unite in affinity. At the depths of the cauldron, the sun glows crimson and yin’s monstrosities vanish; atop the mountain, the moon shines white and the medicinal sprouts renew.

The Three Yellows are orpiment, realgar, and sulphur; together with mercury and cinnabar, they form the Four Spirits. The "myriad herbs" are the drugs of external alchemy. Yet the worldly cannot guard the true and embrace the One, but instead seek outside themselves, inwardly exhausting essence and qi, outwardly ingesting numinous elixirs—this is like ladling boiling water to stop the boil, or carrying firewood to quench the fire: none have ever lived thereby. Not that the elixir lacks efficacy, but that taking it brings no benefit. As Pingshu said: "Without the true seed within, one but boils an empty cauldron with water and fire."

Moreover, the Three Yellows and Four Spirits are what the perfected immortals of the inner elixir employ only after their cultivation is complete, after accumulating merit and virtue, when they weary of the dusty world and wish to dissolve their bonds. Yet how can they abandon the body bequeathed by their parents? For though its essence and blood are foul and putrid, it was born as something wondrous. They must rely on the external elixir to transmute it, to change bones and alter form, to replenish the yang spirit, before they can ride the void and step upon the qi, mount the crane and soar upon the clouds.

Now the common herd, entangled in sensual pleasures, with abundant resources refine the medicine, with depleted vitality seek aid—can this be called "yin and yang finding their kindred"? Can this be called "the two eights standing in balance"? Only when the inner elixir is achieved does one ingest the external elixir: with one’s own pure yang body, one relies upon that pure yang medicine—this is finding kindred. It is like weighing one’s own half-catty against another’s eight ounces—this is standing in balance. Only then does the sun at the bottom of the pool blaze crimson with radiant light, the moon atop the mountain appear faintly manifest. This is the alternation of floating and sinking, the qi’s channels in mutual resonance. What is seen cannot be used; what is used cannot be seen. Those of this age who would grasp this principle must seek true lead and true mercury, not common cinnabar or quicksilver.

*Commentary on the* Awakening to Reality *of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Scroll the First, Concluded*
*Commentary on the* Awakening to Reality *of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Scroll the Second*

The Cloud-Peak Recluse Xia Zongyu of Yongjia wrote:

Not knowing the inversion within the mystery,
How can one plant lotus in fire?
Leading the White Tiger home to nurture,
It yields a luminous pearl round as the moon.

Idly tending the elixir furnace, watching the fire’s timing—
Simply still the spirit and thought, let nature take its course.
When all yin is stripped away, the elixir ripens,
Leaping beyond the mortal dragon to live ten thousand years.

The discourse on the wondrous inversion has been detailed before.
"Planting lotus in fire," though Master Lü [Dongbin] used external matters as metaphor, is in truth the work of internal elixir refinement. Without a teacher’s transmission, scholars vainly labor over annotations. Yet the lotus grows in water, fire arises from wood—how can a water-born thing be planted in fire? This is no principle at all. It is because within the human body there is a thing shaped like a lotus, born of the true yang fire. Though called fire, it is in fact water; though called water, it is in fact fire. Speaking in terms of water, it does not flow to wet nor moisten downward. Speaking in terms of fire, it does not flame upward nor seek dryness. Fire qi concealed in water is called inner yang; water qi concealed in fire is called inner yin. Yin and yang gather essence in water and fire, thus taking form like the lotus. When this lotus is cultivated to maturity, it undergoes a thousand transformations—sometimes sweet as honey, large as a tangerine: this is the lotus. The fruit born on branches, the seed within the womb: this too is the lotus. Even as it becomes *jiaoli* and *huozao*, bearing a thousand names, all are but the manifest virtues of the golden elixir. Only when the lotus is cultivated properly within does its image naturally appear without.

The White Tiger is metal essence. If one can nurture it at home, preventing its wildness, then the crystalline radiance of metal essence emerges—emptiness gives birth to whiteness, the mysterious pearl takes form, thus round as the moon. Those who refine the elixir know only that the fire’s timing for the external elixir lies in the crucible, not realizing that for the internal elixir, the fire’s timing lies within oneself. The sages transmitted the medicine but not the fire; they did not commit the fire’s timing to writing. Thus Master Lü [Dongbin] instructed one to guard the true and embrace the one, aligning with the transformations of heaven and earth, so that yin and yang ascend and descend naturally, as if matching tally tokens.

When all yin is stripped away, the body becomes pure yang—neither born nor destroyed, transcending the realm of things. What cage could confine it? What lifespan could limit it?

To learn immortality, one must learn celestial immortality;
Only the golden elixir is most certain.
When the two things meet, emotion and nature unite;
Where the five phases are complete, tiger and dragon coil.
Originally through *wu* and *ji* as matchmakers,
Husband and wife are thus bound in joy.
Awaiting only the completion of the work to ascend the Jade Palace,
Amidst ninefold radiance, riding a soaring simurgh.

Zhong [Li Quan] and Lü [Dongbin] inquired: Among men, one cultivates to become an immortal; among immortals, one ascends to become celestial. The immortal is one—why then is there a distinction of ascending to heaven? It is because the purely yin without yang is a ghost; the purely yang without yin is an immortal; the mingling of yin and yang is a human. Only humans can become ghosts or immortals. Yet immortals have five ranks: first, celestial immortals; second, spirit immortals; third, earthbound immortals; fourth, ghost immortals; fifth, human immortals.

How then does one cultivate to become a celestial immortal? Not through methods, not through techniques, not through qi, not through force—only by accumulating virtue and merit to refine the golden elixir. What is the golden elixir? It is nothing more than the union of two things, the perfection of the five phases, attaining long life and enduring vision to become an immortal.

The Most High said: Dimly, dimly—within it there is a thing. Vaguely, vaguely—within it there is essence. These two things are the sun and moon, the hun and po, the mating of yin and yang. Modeling heaven and emulating its images, at the time of their union, one is moved and thus attains the Dao. The wonder of emotion and nature is what is meant by "once in thirty days they meet." As for the five phases—metal, wood, water, fire, earth; heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys—gathering their essential spirits, not using their physical forms, ensuring not one is deficient, yin and yang fully present, naturally the dragon and tiger coil, the spirit becomes mighty. This can repel external demons and guard the great Dao.

Tracing to the source, how can the three things unite on their own? How can the five phases perfect themselves? It is only because the earth of *wu* and *ji* sits in the central palace, drawing east and west together, preventing separation. This is what is meant by the union of metal and wood, the mating of water and fire—like husband and wife in joyful union, all through the power of the matchmaker. Cultivating thus within the formless, forming images in the imageless, accumulating days and months, broadly performing hidden merits, mysteriously aligning with heaven and earth, naturally the body returns to pure yang. Ascending in broad daylight, one pays homage to the Jade Emperor in the Golden Portal, rides a colored simurgh through the purple clouds, soars amidst the ninefold radiance, and roams beyond the eight limits.

Is not the ultimate effect of learning immortality indeed the celestial immortal?

To know where the medicine’s river-source is produced,
Only in the southwest is the native land.
When lead sees *gui* born, swiftly gather it;
When metal meets the full moon, it is not yet ripe to taste.
Send it back to the earthen crucible, seal it tightly,
Then join it with flowing pearls to pair them.
The medicine weighs one catty, requiring two eights;
Adjust the fire’s timing, entrusting it to yin and yang.

The *Book of Changes* says: "In the southwest one gains companions; in the northeast one loses companions." The southwest is the *kun* position, the direction where the sun and moon’s hun and po seek each other. At the end of each month, on the thirtieth day at dawn’s twilight, the moon emerges at *yi*, the sun at *jia*—*jia* and *yi* unite, thus "in the southwest one gains companions." That night, the moon’s brilliance leaves no trace, thus "in the northeast one loses companions." Now Master Lü [Dongbin] says the river-source of the medicine’s production lies only in the southwest—is this not because the moon emerges from *kun*, and the *zhen* trigram first receives it? *Kun* transforms into *zhen*, the moon’s yang hun is newly born, thus able to suspend its image and display its brightness. This is what is meant by "on the third day *geng* is born, the *dui* gate opens; black silver yields white silver."

Moreover, it is said: "When the moon rises over the mountain’s peak, the medicinal sprout is newly born"—this is precisely where the river-source of its production lies. Though the moon is the essence and emblem of *Taiyin*, corresponding to metal and water, it in truth steals the sun’s yang radiance to shine. Tracing it to the water born of *Tianyi*, without the lead of metal it cannot be generated; thus when metal flourishes, water is born, and when the moon waxes full, the tide swells high. Now, if one gathers this lead at the time when *gui* is born, it is the mother concealing the child in her womb—if I can gather it for the use of the golden elixir, this is precisely the moment when the solitary yang first stirs to form the elixir. Should metal encounter the distant full moon, then only after the fifteenth day does the moon begin to grow its *po*; this *po* belongs to yin, and from the sixteenth to the thirtieth day, the *po* fills while the *hun* wanes, yang declines and yin prevails—such metal is unfit for consumption. Since metal at the distant full moon is unfit, one must swiftly seek the lead born of *gui*, which is the gold within water, and having obtained it, return it to the earthen crucible’s central chamber, pairing it with *liuzhu* and refining it with fire-tending. Seal it tightly to prevent any risk of escape; balance the weights evenly to avoid any excess or deficiency. How then could the golden elixir fail to form?

The *Cantong Qi* says:
*"Mercury is the sun’s flowing pearl,
The Azure Dragon attends it;
Raising the east to meet the west,
Hun and po naturally bind.
The upper crescent counts eight in *dui*,
The lower crescent counts eight as well;
When the two crescents join their essence,
The body of Qian and Kun is complete.
Two eights make one catty—
The Dao of Change stands firm and true."*

This perfectly accords with the verse. Do not mistake solitary yin for possessing yang, for cultivating this alone will only lead to emaciation. Exerting the body with postures and stretches is not the Way; refining qi and ingesting mist is sheer madness. The world vainly seeks the subjugation of mercury and gold—when will they ever witness the descent of tiger and dragon? I urge you to thoroughly seek the place of your own birth: returning to the root and restoring the origin is the King of Medicines.

Master Yunfang’s *Zhixuan Pian* says:
*"Tears, sleep-drool, essence, saliva, qi, blood, and fluids—
These seven have ever belonged to yin.
If one takes these as the substance of immortality,
How can one’s spirit soar to the Jade Capital?"*

And again:
*"The four great elements of the body all belong to yin—
Who knows what thing is yang’s essence?
If by good fortune you meet a luminous teacher’s guidance,
The Dao and immortality are yours in this very moment."*

These poems guide lost learners with such profound clarity! Yet the Buddhists, clinging to vacuity, sit sated and face the wall, believing that cutting off desire and preserving essence and qi can lead to the Dao. I see only their bodies withering, their forms weakening, growing ever more emaciated, until the bell tolls and the water-clock runs dry—at last they become mere ghosts of yin’s good spirits. Even worse are those ignorant Dao-seekers who merely crane their necks like bears or stretch like crows, ingest mist and refine qi, or mistake the heart and kidneys for mercury and gold, the liver and lungs for dragon and tiger—all blind cultivation and reckless refinement, unaware of the true yang’s ancestral source. How then can they return to the root, restore the origin, and attain the great medicine?

Though at the outset of entering the Dao, one closely observes the human body—nothing more than tears, saliva, essence, saliva, qi, blood, and fluids; heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—all nourishing this illusory form, how can one claim they all belong to yin? Beyond these, is there truly no real yang to be found? My heart has long been unsatisfied. For twenty years, Master Yunfang perused the *Daoist Canon*, consulted the Nine Schools, and met countless so-called Daoists—all saying only to swallow saliva and gulp down drool. Yet in all the world, none could resolve this doubt. Even the *Guanyuan Yuan Dadao Ge* merely states that this thing originally has no fixed position, transforming with the mind’s intent: in the body, when feeling heat it becomes sweat; in the nose, when struck by wind it becomes mucus; in the kidneys, when aroused it becomes essence; in the eyes, when grieved it becomes tears—still not revealing what true yang truly is. The *Taishang Qibao Wulou Jing* likewise says: "To nourish the spirit, first nourish qi; to nourish qi, first nourish tears; to nourish tears, first nourish mucus; to nourish mucus, first nourish saliva; to nourish saliva, first nourish blood; to nourish blood, first nourish essence; to nourish essence, first nourish fluids; to nourish fluids, first nourish water." Water is the flower-pool’s saliva, the essence of primordial qi, found in the tongue’s cavity—yet it still does not speak of the reality of yang essence. This only deepens confusion, leaving one’s heart and mind bewildered, as if questioning ghosts and spirits without resolution.

Those who cultivate this alone indeed grow frail: some hearts restless and vexed, some loins heavy and stiff, some dreamless yet leaking. With guiding and breathing, day and night, they may briefly recover, but if interrupted by busyness, a hundred illnesses assail them, and medicines are taken in vain—not only futile, but gravely harmful. Onlookers secretly mock, fellow Daoists lose heart and retreat. Only my foolish self remains unshaken, my faith in the Dao ever firmer. I say: can the sagely worthies of old, who bequeathed teachings to the world, have erred in misleading later generations? It is only that my own practice is not steadfast, my teacher’s transmission not true. Resolutely, I cast off the cage, traversed famous mountains and grottoes, silently prayed to the unseen, seeking to fathom the mystery’s pointer. Suddenly, at Dragon-Tiger Mountain, I first received an auspicious dream; then on Zhurong Peak, I encountered a sagely teacher—its details are fully recorded in *The Full Account of My Encounter with the Immortal*. At last, I obtained the secret of true yang, which can subdue the four great yin elements of the body—neither essence nor qi, neither kidney nor heart, neither tears nor saliva, neither blood nor fluids.

The place of this thing’s birth precedes heaven and earth; the place of its dissolution precedes heaven and earth’s end. The five phases—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—converge here; the five viscera—heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—concentrate their numen here; the seven substances—tears, saliva, essence, saliva, qi, blood, and fluids—crystallize their excellence here. In its vastness, even heaven and earth can contain it.

In its smallness, not even a mote of dust can enter.
In its function, it has neither interior nor exterior.
In its attainment, there is neither sage nor commoner.
The people use it daily yet do not know it; the sage alone can fathom its root and origin.
Should one grasp the marvel of the seven returns and nine revolutions, this may become the sovereign medicine, the root of the Dao.
Then the myriad yin substances will circulate through the four limbs like a child clinging to its mother, never parting.
The heart will not be restless, the perineum will not burn, the waist will not feel heavy, and dreams will not leak.
Spirit and qi will merge in harmony, the radiance of essence will illuminate all things—how could there be any affliction of frailty?
The eyes will flash like lightning, the beard will be black as lacquer, the mind will attain foresight, and one will respond to ten thousand affairs without weariness.
Mercury and gold will naturally submit, dragon and tiger will naturally descend.
Not through the extraction of sinews or the breaking of bones, nor through the expulsion of the old and absorption of the new, but naturally one’s virtue will unite with heaven and earth, one’s brightness will unite with the sun and moon, one’s order will unite with the four seasons, and one’s fortune will unite with the spirits.
Truly, I possess some measure of immortal arts—not among the three thousand six hundred schools.

Profound! Wondrous! This is not to be transmitted without swearing oaths to heaven and earth, nor passed from father to son.
Those who violate this will incur heavenly calamity and human punishment, with no recourse to prayer.

In plants and trees, yin and yang are also paired as one:
If either is lacking, they will not flourish.
First, green leaves unfold as yang takes the lead;
Next, red flowers bloom as yin follows after.
This is the constant Dao of daily use,
Yet who knows the true source of its ebb and flow?
I say to all who study the Dao:
Do not scorn what you do not understand of yin and yang.
The Dao is called the unity of yin and yang;
An excess of either is called illness.
Is the teaching of yin and yang in balance mere empty talk?
All things bear yin and embrace yang,
And cannot tolerate the slightest imbalance.
If yang is excessive without yin, yang has nothing to transform;
If yin is excessive without yang, yin has nothing to generate.
Take plants and trees as an example:
Green leaves unfold first—this is yang’s primal arising.
Red flowers follow after—this is yin’s subsequent flourishing.
In their arising, they grow and mature through spring and summer;
In their flourishing, they return to the root and restore life in autumn and winter.
If one embodies this as the constant Dao of daily practice,
Then day is yang, night is yin;
Midnight is yang, noon is yin.
Yin and yang alternate in their movement, each requiring the other to complete the Dao.
The true source ebbs and flows, giving rise to endless generation—this is uniting one’s virtue with heaven and earth.

Though yin and yang are paired as one, they are not rigidly divided into two separate things.
Within yin, yang is never absent;
Within yang, yin is never absent.
Thus, the sun is the great yang, yet within it is the yin of the golden crow;
The moon is the great yin, yet within it is the yang of the jade hare.
Yin and yang are paired as one, mutually engendering transformation—
Those who study the Dao should not lightly dismiss this.

The myriad volumes of alchemical scriptures all speak in unison:
The golden elixir is but this, the root and origin.
Following earth’s position, the body of generation takes form;
Planted in heaven’s domain, the palace of union and response.
Do not blame the celestial mechanism for being revealed today—
It is only because those who study the Dao remain deluded.
If one comprehends the meaning within this verse,
One will immediately behold the Three Pure Ones and the Most High Lord.

Qian and Kun are the gates of the *Book of Changes*, the parents of all hexagrams.
If one who studies the Dao does not first cultivate the two hexagrams Qian and Kun,
It is like a person without parents—how can they be born?
Now, Kun’s position is the southwest, Qian’s position is the northwest.
Kun is pure yin, Qian is pure yang.
Yin and yang being pure, they are utterly distant and distinct—how could they generate transformation?
Only because Kun’s position holds the body of generation,
And Qian’s domain contains the palace of union and response.
Master Lian (Peng Xiao) explored the profound and probed the hidden,
Drew forth the distant and gathered the subtle,
Revealing the secret mysteries of the *Cantong Qi*
And expounding the profound subtleties of the *Dragon-Tiger Classic*.
Above, he could take the place of the Most High in teaching the Dao;
Below, he could enlighten later generations.
After Zhong and Lü, only Master Lian stood alone—
How majestic! How splendid!

Moreover, though the alchemical scriptures number in the tens of thousands,
With principles, methods, and techniques appearing vast and intricate,
The teachings on the golden elixir are all the same.
The three thousand six hundred minor methods and side doors,
Even if one were to gather them all, would not be the Dao.
What, then, is the Dao?
It is uniting one’s virtue with heaven and earth.
Thus, Qian is heaven, Kun is earth.
Heaven is yang, earth is yin.
Though their positions seem distant,
The six children mutually generate, yin and yang alternate in succession,
As seen in the union of the sun and moon.
The *Book of Changes* says: If heaven and earth do not unite, the myriad things will not flow.
Heaven and earth unite once a month, Qian and Kun transform six times a month.
From Kun comes generation, from Qian comes union and response.
Thus, in the beginning, Kun transforms three times to become Qian;
In the end, Qian transforms three times to return to Kun.
Their operation is endless, cycling without cease.
By this, the new and full moons are determined, the crescents and full phases are completed.
The circulation of the twenty-four qi, the passage of the celestial degrees—
All that fashions the myriad things into the work of the year
Is the function of Qian, Kun, and the six children.
How is this made clear?
The *Dragon-Tiger Upper Classic* says: On the third day, the moon emerges in the west at Geng, dividing at Mao and You.
The *Cantong Qi* says: Above Bi and Xu, Zhen emerges, proving the inception of yang qi.
Now, Geng and Bi and Xu are all positions of the west, Kun’s domain.
The moon, born in this place of Kun’s pure yin, receives pure yin qi.
Its qi being yin, its body is heavy, its nature must be dim—
How can it illuminate the eight directions, entering the east and exiting the west, yet operate endlessly?
The moon cannot shine on its own; it must receive the qi of true yang before it can shine.
Thus, on the third day, the moon begins to wax, appearing in Kun’s western domain.
Kun transforms once to become Zhen, and Zhen governs the six Geng.
Geng is the celestial stem corresponding to Zhen’s hexagram—
This is how yin and yang can shine.

The *Cantong Qi* states: On the third day, the moon emerges as "scouring brightness," with Zhen receiving Geng in the western direction. The eldest son inherits the father’s body, establishing its foundation through the mother. As Master Pingshu says: On the third day, Geng is born and Zhen’s gate opens—this is the black-silver furnace yielding white silver. Kun transforms a second time to become Dui, and Dui governs the moon’s emergence on the eighth day in Ding’s domain. Dui governs the six Ding, corresponding to Dui’s hexagram. The *Upper Classic* says: On the eighth day, the moon emerges in Ding, its upper arc weighing half a catty of metal. The *Cantong Qi* states: Dui receives Ding’s tally, its upper arc straight as a plumb line. As Pingshu says: When the moon first appears at the sky’s edge as a half-wheel, the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl resound.

Kun transforms a third time to become Qian, and Qian governs the moon’s emergence on the fifteenth day in Jia’s domain. Qian governs the six Jia, corresponding to Qian’s hexagram. The *Upper Classic* says: On the fifteenth day, the three yang are complete, round and illuminating Jia in the east. Metal and water warm the great yang, red marrow flows as mercury, and the maidens play in the radiant moonlight. The *Cantong Qi* states: When the three and five virtues are complete, Qian’s body is fully formed. That night, the moon’s brilliance is full, and the great yin shines brightly. Yet it is not yin’s power that illuminates—it is the true yang at its zenith. However, when yang flourishes, it must strike yin, and when things reach their extreme, they revert to their origin. Waxing and waning, growth and decline—such is the natural principle of heaven. The *Upper Classic* says: When the moon waxes to its fullness, it must wane. On the sixteenth day, it begins to diminish, as Qian’s yang line is broken to form Xun. At dawn, the moon aligns with Xin. From the sixteenth day onward, the moon emerges in Xin’s domain, as Qian’s first reduction forms Xun. Xun governs the six Xin, corresponding to Xun’s hexagram. At this time, the moon’s light returns to the sun, and the yang line must wane. The *Cantong Qi* states: The divine tally wanes and breaks, its flourishing and decline gradually transforming, ultimately returning to its origin, with Xun inheriting its mandate.

From the twenty-first to the twenty-fifth day, the moon emerges in Bing’s southern domain, as Qian’s second reduction forms Gen. Gen governs the six Bing, corresponding to Gen’s hexagram. The *Upper Classic* says: Qian’s second reduction forms Gen, and on the twenty-third day, the lower arc weighs half a catty of water. The *Cantong Qi* states: Gen governs advance and retreat, not overstepping its time. From the twenty-sixth to the thirtieth day, the moon emerges in Yi’s domain, as Qian’s third reduction forms Kun. Kun governs the six Yi, corresponding to Kun’s hexagram. The *Upper Classic* says: Qian’s third transformation forms Kun, and on the thirtieth day, Kun-Yi loses its companion in the northeast. The moon sets in Yi-Kun, and as Yi-Kun’s moon wanes, earth, wood, and metal are about to transform. Following Kun, Zhen’s dragon is born, and Qian and Kun encompass the beginning and end. The *Cantong Qi* states: The five and six of Kun’s succession bind the beginning and end. This is the return to the origin, the alternation of yin and yang—its Dao is greatly luminous, its function inexhaustible. It is called the union of heaven and earth, the conjunction of sun and moon. It is called Qian’s three searches giving birth to three sons, and Kun’s three searches giving birth to three daughters. Male and female intermingle, yin and yang pair—is this not relying on Kun’s position to form the body, planting the seed in Qian’s domain to stir the senses?

Alas! The sun is heaven’s hun-soul, the blood and marrow of the great Dao. The moon is earth’s po-soul, the essence and qi of the great Dao. The great Dao does not lose its sun and moon, and so endures for kalpas without end. The human body does not lose its sun and moon, and so attains deathlessness and eternal life. Yet scholars are deluded, their natural endowments dull. Worse still, some take the false as the norm, wine as their drink, and the six desires and seven emotions sever their original true nature. They become walking corpses, phoenixes in flight—far removed from the human Dao. How can they partake in the way of the three powers standing as one?

Now, Pingshu has revealed the celestial mechanism, directly pointing to the mysterious pass and essential path. One who comprehends this profound meaning will find that the august Three Pure Ones are not distant from oneself. As the saying goes: "One attainment is eternal attainment," and one immediately ascends to the sacred rank. This principle is most profound and wondrous. Without innate spiritual bone and unwavering resolve to cultivate the Dao, even if one encounters a sage-teacher, they will often miss the mark. Scholars, take heed!

Without recognizing true lead and the correct lineage,
All efforts are in vain, labor wasted.
Dismissing one’s wife only severs yin and yang,
Fasting merely empties the stomach and bowels.
Herbs, metals, gold, and silver are but coarse matter,
Clouds, mist, sun, and moon remain obscure.
Even with breath control and visualization,
None compare to the work of the golden elixir.

The path of cultivation prioritizes restraint of desire—does this poem encourage indulgence? No. The great Dao is non-action, while side paths involve much ado. People mistakenly believe that avoiding women, abstaining from cooked food, refining elixirs, consuming mist, practicing breath control, or visualizing the kidneys and heart encompass the Dao’s profound mysteries. Yet forced restraint does not arise from nature, and deliberate action is not free from delusion. Moreover, lead has the true and the ordinary, the ancestral and the secondary—truly not easy to discern. If one receives transmission from a teacher, the Dao is present at a glance, and the radiant golden elixir forms in a single day. Without such guidance, blind practice and haphazard refinement may bring comfort and longevity, slightly better than those who recklessly abandon life and lose their origin. Yet they remain unrelated to the great path of the golden elixir.

Although the Heavenly Master lineage has endured thirty-six generations, and Master Xu Jingshan’s family has over forty members ascending in broad daylight, or Liu An the Prince and Liu Gang practicing dual cultivation with their wives, or Wei Boyang having a son in official service—none attained the Dao by dismissing wives or fasting. There is no other reason: some achieved the Dao in boyhood, others cultivated after marriage. All progressed through inner practice and accumulating hidden virtue, advancing from the lesser vehicle to the middle vehicle, and from the middle to the greater vehicle. None attained the great Dao in a single leap.

Master Pingshu’s intent is not to sweep away all the unprofitable side paths but to emphasize the profound form of the Golden Elixir’s Way—scholars must not let the words obscure the meaning.

"Three, five, and one" are but three characters,
Yet those who truly understand them through the ages are rare indeed.
Bind three from the east and two from the south to make five,
One from the north and four from the west share the same.
Wu and Ji reside in their native generative numbers,
When the three families meet, the infant is formed.
The infant is the One containing true qi,
After ten months of gestation, the embryo is complete, and the foundation of sagehood is laid.

The "three and five" make fifteen.
Adding one yields sixteen.
Sixteen is the number of two eights.
Seekers of the Way through the ages have variously taken "two eights" as *mao* and *you*, or as one *jin*.
Little do they know that the great Way of the Golden Elixir does not transcend the creative transformations of the Five Phases, and the creative transformations of the Five Phases do not escape the great numbers of Heaven and Earth.
How to clarify this?
For when two and eight combine, their number is ten.
Ten as a number encompasses the secrets of the Five Phases and weaves the warp of Heaven and Earth.
Thus, Heaven One generates Water, and Earth Six completes it.
Earth Two generates Fire, and Heaven Seven completes it.
Heaven Three generates Wood, and Earth Eight completes it.
Earth Four generates Metal, and Heaven Nine completes it.
Heaven Five generates Earth, and Earth Ten completes it.
This—Heaven One and Earth Two, Heaven Three and Earth Four, Heaven Five and Earth Six, Heaven Seven and Earth Eight, Heaven Nine and Earth Ten—is none other than the great generative numbers.
The immortals’ veiled language does not say "ten" but "two eights,"
Nor "sixteen" but "three, five, one."
Seekers of old and present are as numerous as ox hairs, yet those who comprehend are as rare as qilin horns.
Truly, those who understand this Way are few indeed.

Though the generative numbers of Heaven and Earth do not exceed ten, the marvelous workings of the Five Phases’ transformations ultimately return to five.
For five is the number of Earth, and Earth is the progenitor of the Elixir.
The three of the east (Wood) and the two of the south (Fire) belong to the yang position and together form five.
The one of the north (Water) and the four of the west (Metal) occupy the yin position and likewise form five.
As for Wu and Ji, they naturally generate Earth from the number five.

Now, why does Master Pingshu speak not of the harmony of the Four Symbols or the gathering of the Five Phases but only of the meeting of the three families?
For Metal and Wood, without the mandate to separate, find Earth residing in the center as their matchmaker—these are the three families.
Water and Fire, transformed through the *jiji* configuration, find Earth residing in the center as their mediator—these too are the three families.
As the saying goes, "When they meet Earth, they become three clans."
Without Wu and Ji, the Elixir cannot be formed.
The infant is knit from these three families—it is the child nurtured within the Void.

Yet the formation of the infant does not come from without; all arises from the true Unity of the Great One and the primordial qi, returning to the origin and reverting to oneself.
At first, Heaven bestows and Earth generates, receiving the legacy of one’s parents, and through ten months of gestation, the physical body is nurtured.
Now, returning to the origin, one seizes the creative transformations of yin and yang, and likewise through ten months, transcends the mundane and enters sagehood.
Within the profound lies the wondrous, within the wondrous lies the marvelous—beyond the ken of mortal dust.

This is the secret purport of Master Pingshu’s *Awakening to Reality*, revealed in the poem of "three, five, one."
Without encountering an immortal teacher, scholars recklessly force interpretations.
I, undeterred by my inadequacy, have elucidated it in detail to bring clarity.
Some may fault me for excessive disclosure, to which I reply:
Those who crave tea do not enter taverns; those fond of sensuality do not delight in pure abstinence.
The common folk, bound by their karmic tendencies, cannot be uniformly transformed.
If one is ignorant of the study of nature and destiny, even with the Yellow Emperor and Laozi as teachers and Confucius and Yan Hui as friends, instructing them face-to-face, those without the affinity of ice and charcoal are few.
What use would they find in these five words?

Should one possess innate spiritual bones and obtain this key, interpreting the text to grasp its meaning, then across a thousand years and ten thousand miles, one’s heart meets the author—what greater fortune could there be?
As the saying goes, "Carrying a hundred gold pieces through the market and losing them on the road, those who find and use them value even five gold pieces as no loss."
Thus, met with silence, I have respectfully written these sixteen detailed explanations to dispel the world’s delusions.

*Lecture Notes on the "Awakening to Reality" of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Volume Two, Concluded.*

**Lecture Notes on the "Awakening to Reality" of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Volume Three**
*By Yunfeng Sanren, Xia Zongyu of Yongjia*

Sixty-four quatrains to correspond to the sixty-four hexagrams:

First take Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel,
Then use the Crow and Hare to boil the medicine.
If you can drive these two things into the Yellow Path,
How could the Yellow Sprout fail to grow?

Qian is Heaven, Kun is Earth.
Qian is yang, Kun is yin.
Heaven’s yang is above, Earth’s yin is below.
Once above and below are fixed, the form of the crucible and vessel is complete.

The Crow is the sun, the Hare is the moon.
The sun is yang, the moon is yin.
The sun’s yang arises in the east, the moon’s yin arises in the west.
Once east and west are divided, the medicines must be kept apart.

The Yellow Path is the central, correct position of the Five Phases.
The Yellow Sprout is the numinous shoot of the Golden Elixir.
If Heaven and Earth use Qian and Kun as crucible and vessel,
How could the crucible and vessel of our bodies fail to embody the function of Qian and Kun?
If Heaven and Earth use the Crow and Hare as medicines,
How could the medicines of our bodies not refine the essence of the Crow and Hare?

Yet there are crucibles of both the *Already Achieved* and the *Not Yet Achieved*,
Neither of which can neglect the work of water and fire.
Thus, the refining of metal depends on water and fire,
But water and fire cannot sustain themselves—
They must rely on the virtue of Earth to complete the work.
Without *wu* and *ji*, the Elixir cannot form.
If one can daily refine and hourly boil,
Driving the two things into the central palace of the True Earth,
Then the Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir will sprout and grow,
Daily receiving the harmonious qi of the eastern wind until it reaches the state of pure yang.
What is called "the flower of the heart blooming in clarity, the fruit of the Dao perfected,"
Large as an orange and sweet as honey—
All arises from the flourishing of this Yellow Sprout.

The method of setting up the furnace and establishing the crucible follows Qian and Kun,
Tempering the essence to govern the *po* and *hun*.
Gathering and dispersing, misty and swirling, they form transformations—
How dare one presume to speak of fixed forms in advance?

The furnace is set up externally, the crucible established internally.
Though the model lies in the vessel, its essence is the body of Qian and Kun.
Thus, borrowing this crucible and vessel to refine the medicines,
The sun’s essence, the moon’s radiance, the sun’s *hun*, the moon’s *po*—
These two things gather and disperse, their qi misty and swirling, forming transformations,
So that the Golden Elixir may be achieved.
How dare one presume to speak of fixed forms?
For the spirit has no fixed form, and the *Yi* has no fixed body—
This is the mystery within mystery, the subtlety within subtlety,
Not a matter of learning through words or ears.

The workings of the inner and outer Elixirs share this formless, bodiless wonder,
Beyond thought, beyond description.
If the scholar has the affinity,
Then through heart-to-heart transmission and oral instruction,
Once attained, it is attained forever.
Without relying on written words,
It directly points to the mystery of the supreme vehicle,
Ascending to sagehood and attaining immortality in an instant.

Do not cling to the elixir furnace and waste effort—
To refine the medicine, seek the Reclining Moon Furnace.
It naturally possesses the true fire of Heaven’s nurturing,
With no need for firewood, charcoal, or blowing.

The Dao of the Elixir runs deep.
There is the inner Elixir and the outer Elixir.
The inner Elixir refines the radiance of the sun and moon,
Gathers the true spirit of the original spirit—
This is returning to the root and reverting to the origin, the supreme Dao.
The outer Elixir takes true lead and true mercury,
Adjusts the fire times, adds and withdraws,
To form the medicine of long life.
If one has the inner Elixir but not the outer,
Though the Dao may be attained, the physical body remains heavy,
Unable to escape cold and heat, and cannot ascend in flight.
One must obtain the outer Elixir to transform the physical form,
So that the foul and rotten may give birth to the divine and wondrous.
If one has the outer Elixir but not the inner,
It is like "boiling an empty pot with water and fire when there is no true seed within"—
The divine and wondrous will revert to the foul and rotten.

Master Pingshu’s poem does not mean to entirely reject the outer Elixir,
But pities that the world knows only the outer and not the inner,
So he uses the metaphor of firewood, charcoal, and the elixir furnace to enlighten them.
The Reclining Moon Furnace is the vessel for refining the Elixir within the human body,
Its shape like the moon’s first crescent.
It naturally possesses the true fire of yang,
Nurtured by the four seasons, illuminating Heaven and Earth,
Thus requiring no firewood, charcoal, or blowing.
As for the refining of the outer Elixir, these cannot be dispensed with—
This is merely speaking in reverse.

In the Reclining Moon Furnace, the Jade Medicine grows;
In the Cinnabar Crucible, the mercury levels.
Only after the fire force is harmonized,
Does the Yellow Sprout gradually mature.

The workings of the inner and outer Elixirs are the same:
Setting up the furnace, establishing the crucible,
Refining cinnabar and mercury—
All rely on water and fire as the foundation.
For fire can generate Earth, Earth can generate Metal,
And the Yellow Sprout is the numinous shoot of the Golden Elixir.
This refers to the crucible and medicines of the outer Elixir,
To illustrate the crucible and medicines of our bodies.

Some mistakenly take the Reclining Moon Furnace as the shape of the inner kidneys,
Or the Cinnabar Crucible as the symbol of the red heart—
Both are wrong.
Others take the Jade Medicine and mercury as the essence and fluids—
These are also incorrect.
Though the furnace resembles the Reclining Moon
And the crucible uses cinnabar,
Though their symbolic forms differ,
They are in truth the same vessel for refining the Golden Elixir within the human body.
Though the Jade Medicine and mercury are differently named,
They are in truth the same mother of the Golden Elixir within the human body.
If one can skillfully add and withdraw, advance and retreat the fire,
Ascending and descending in accord with Heaven and Earth,
Uniting like the sun and moon,
With the fire times harmonized without the slightest error,
Naturally the Yellow Sprout will sprout and flourish,
Auspicious qi will swirl and gather,
The Golden Elixir will form as treasure,
And one will be coeval with Heaven and Earth.

Swallowing fluids and absorbing qi is what humans do,
But only with the right substance can the myriad things be born.
"If there is no true seed within,
It is like boiling an empty pot with water and fire."

Fluids are water, qi is fire.
In the human body, fluids moisten it, qi moves it—
Water and fire nurture each other, enabling long life.
But when desires and cravings flourish,
Exhausting the original source of water and fire,
The true essence is depleted—
Like a tree without roots,
Though it may be touched by rain and dew, it cannot stand on its own.

Now that the true origin is already lost, merely swallowing fluids and absorbing qi is like using water and fire to boil an empty pot—it not only brings no benefit but also causes harm.

When it comes to this, preserving the Great Harmony and each fulfilling its nature and destiny—who but the purely yang, the unceasingly vigorous and strong of *qian*, could achieve this?

To harmonize lead and mercury and form the Elixir,
Both great and small must remain unharmed, both realms preserved intact.
If you ask what true lead is—
It is the toad’s radiance, shining all day upon the Western River.

The Golden Elixir is formed from lead and mercury,
And their perfect balance is the wonder.
If one side prevails excessively, harmony is lost—
Then either the great is harmed, or the small.
How can the Elixir form when the two *qi* wax and wane?
The deluded deem yang noble and great, yin base and small,
And take "the small departing, the great arriving" as the return of solitary yang—unharmed.
All this is forced interpretation.
They do not know that the Golden Elixir cannot form alone;
It requires one lead and one mercury, each belonging to its own realm.
Only when fire times are harmonized and the two merged into one
Does the Elixir coalesce.
Thus it is said: *"Different names, same origin—few understand."*

The two are the subtle mechanism of the profound mystery.
If you ask of true lead’s form and name—
It is like the toad’s luminous essence, shining all day upon the Western River.
For the toad’s essence is the moon’s water,
And the Western River is the metal of *kun* and *shen*.
The *Dragon-Tiger Classic* says: *"On the third day, the moon emerges at geng,
Westward divided between mao and you."*
This is the image of metal giving birth to water,
When the moon’s toad essence begins to form.
The moon, being of water and yin, is dark by nature—
It cannot illuminate itself but must borrow the fire of the great yang to shine.
Thus the toad’s light persists all day.
It is like a mirror of bronze or iron,
Freshly cast and dull, utterly lacking brightness to reflect anything.
Only when lead and tin are applied does its radiance burst forth,
Rivaling the sun and moon in brilliance.
Why? Bronze and iron are yin;
Lead and tin are yang.
Yin borrows yang to become luminous.
The *Triple Unison* says: *"The sun unites the essence of the Five Phases,
The moon receives the measure of the Six Pitches."* This is the principle.

Do not hide in the mountains to refine the Returning Elixir—
Within and without the mountains, there is no true lead.
This supreme treasure exists in every household,
Yet people of this age fail to recognize it fully.

The great hermit dwells in the marketplace,
The lesser in the mountains.
For the cliffs are where ten eyes gaze and ten fingers point—
The bustling city, where a thousand treasures and a hundred goods gather.
If the adept resides here, the Elixir’s work is easily accomplished.
This is not external alchemy.
It is like the human body, which also has its marketplace—
Where the hundred bones and hundred vessels converge,
Where the seven treasures and six yangs reside.
If the cultivator applies effort here, the Returning Elixir may be achieved.
As for the mountains—remote, secluded, steeped in utmost yin—
What refuge do they offer?
It is like seeking utmost yin in the practice of the Elixir,
As Master Yunfang said of tears, saliva, essence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and humor—
All seven belong to yin.
Is this not *"within and without the mountains, no true lead exists"*?

Master Pingshu said: To restore the Elixir, one must cultivate true yang,
Not utmost yin.
The treasure of true yang is possessed by all at birth—
No distinction of noble or base, small or great, monk or Daoist, mortal or immortal.
As we Confucians say: *"Where there is a thing, there is a principle;
The constant nature is ever present."*
This is the meaning of *"the supreme treasure exists in every household."*

To mend bamboo, use bamboo;
To hatch a chick, use an egg.
Striving with all manner of mismatched things is labor in vain—
How can it compare to true lead uniting with the sacred mechanism?

Like attracts like, things gather by kind—
The *Great Change* has long declared this.
How much more so the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir,
Which does not lie beyond our own bodies?
Its mechanism responds in silence, in accord with Heaven and Earth.
One must seek the root, pluck the stem, return to the origin—
Then the supreme Way is not complex.
If one grasps at all manner of mismatched things,
Failing to recognize the yang of true lead—
It is like stitching flowers in hope of fruit.
What has this to do with the Way?

Thus we know:
With bamboo, mend bamboo;
With an egg, hatch a chick;
With true lead, unite with the sacred mechanism.
Why? It is like using original essence to replenish original *qi*,
Or original *qi* to replenish original spirit—
All follow the natural path of resonance,
Using true yang to gather constant yin.
If one employs common lead or mismatched substances,
It is labor in vain.

Do not use common lead—use true lead,
And when true lead has served its purpose, discard it.
This is the true and wondrous secret of using lead:
*"Use lead, yet do not use it"* is the sincere teaching.

The ancient immortals said:
*"Foxes and hares do not nurse horses,
Swallows and sparrows do not hatch phoenixes.
Plant millet to grow millet,
Refine gold only with gold."*
And again:
*"Lead is the mother of the sprout,
The sprout is the child of lead.
Once the golden flower is obtained,
Discard the lead and do not employ it."*
Thus we know:
Lead mothers differ in true and common,
Their use differs in sequence.
To nurture the child, one must first use true lead to lay the Elixir’s foundation.
When the child matures into a village,
The lead mother must be cast aside to stand alone.
The ancient song of the Elixir’s secret says:
*"Nurture the child into a dragon, proud and lofty,
Then despise the original mother as vulgar and clamorous."*
This speaks of external alchemy,
But scholars should grasp its application to internal alchemy.
For instance:
Guarding the heart, contemplating the kidneys, treasuring *qi*, refining essence—
All embody the intent of using lead.
Yet when attaining the supreme, effortless Great Dao of the Golden Elixir,
The heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys,
Essence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and humor—
All must be set aside.
Thus *"use lead, yet do not use it"* is the sincere teaching.

To empty the heart and fill the abdomen—both meanings run deep,
But emptying the heart is to know the heart.
Better to first fill the abdomen by refining lead,
Then guard the teaching and keep the hall filled with gold.

A heart emptied is unstained by a single speck of dust—
Thus it can nurture the nature.

A full abdomen preserves the supreme treasure without loss—
Thus can one nurture the elixir.
This is where the cultivator of truth plants hand and foot.
Yet世人 seek to empty the heart only to fill it again,
And strive to fill the abdomen only to empty it—why?
I observe those whose hearts are "full":
A hundred thoughts swarm like hedgehogs, deluded and inverted,
Greed, wrath, and ignorance chasing after things, forgetting to return—
When have they ever truly known their own hearts?
Those whose abdomens are "empty":
Indulge in passions and desires, taking falsehood as the norm,
Draining true *qi* and essence, seeking pleasure day and night—
When have they ever truly filled their abdomens?
Thus Master Pingshu pitied them,
And on the matter of emptying the heart and filling the abdomen, offered twofold warnings.
If one must choose where to begin,
Then filling the abdomen cannot be delayed.
For the human heart is not easily emptied—
Emptied, it shares the measure of heaven and earth,
And roams with the Creator.
Our Master Confucius followed his heart’s desires at seventy without overstepping the bounds—
How easily could such emptiness be attained?
But filling the abdomen may come first.
If one can temper indulgence in sensual pleasures,
Curb excessive desires,
Preserve true *qi*, and guard essence,
Then lead may be refined, and the abdomen filled.
With gold and treasure filling the hall,
One may abide in the world and attain long life.

In a dream, I visited Xihua and ascended to the Ninth Heaven,
Where I was clearly bestowed the *Zhixuan Pian*.
Its words are few and simple—
Only to teach you to refine mercury and lead.

Master Pingshu said: To learn immortality, one must learn *Tianxian* (Heavenly Immortality).
For the *Tianxian* departs from grotto-heavens,
Ranks among the Nine Heavens,
Rides clouds and commands winds,
Drives carriages drawn by simurghs and cranes,
And descends to the imperial court.
Though the great earth and mountains may be bound by kalpas,
The joy and effortless freedom of the *Tianxian* remain unbound.
How is this attained?
Its principle is profound, its method simple—
Nothing more than refining the two substances: mercury and lead.
Thus, when the sincerity of the Dao-seeker moves heaven,
Even in dreams, the gates of Xihua may be approached,
And the *Tianxian* respectfully bestows the *Zhixuan Pian*,
Instructing in the great medicine of refining lead and mercury.
Its way is simple and easy to practice,
Unlike the three thousand six hundred heterodox paths, which are needlessly complex.

The Dao, from emptiness, gives birth to the One *qi*,
And from the One *qi* arise yin and yang.
Yin and yang unite to form the Three Bodies,
And from the Three Bodies, the myriad things flourish.
Before the Great Simplicity scattered,
There was a thing formless yet complete—
Who then were yin and yang?
Who grasped the myriad things as such?
From the Dao came the One—the One is the *Taiyi*, the *qi* containing truth.
From the One came the Two—yin and yang, opening and closing in form.
From the Two came the Three, and from the Three, the myriad things—scattered and distinct.
If the scholar can trace beginnings to their end,
And know the Great Dao is nameless, rooted in the One *qi*,
Then they may draw the One *qi* from the dim and indistinct,
And with it forge the Golden Elixir.
Yin and yang will then unite as naturally as heaven and earth give birth to the myriad things,
And one will stand as the Third Power alongside heaven and earth.

The thunder roars in the north, refining gold and water in the northwest,
Fire erupts from Kunlun, yin and yang conjoined.
If these two substances return to one place,
The medicine ripens, and fragrance suffuses the body.
*Kan* is water; *dian* is lightning.
*Peng hong* is the sound of their clash.
"Gold and water" refers to the northwest.
"Fire erupts" is pure yang ascending.
Kunlun is the mountain towering to heaven—
The realm of daily wandering.
Yin and yang: the Dao is called the interplay of one yin and one yang.
The "two substances" are the crow and hare.
"Returning to one place" is the chamber of union.
"Medicine ripe, body fragrant" is the effect of the Golden Elixir’s completion.
Wondrous! Marvelous!
This poem reveals the marrow of the Great Dao—
All is "non-doing within doing,"
Form within the formless,
Nothing that is not the principle of spontaneity.
Like the *Fulu* hexagram at midnight:
Its trigram is *Kan*, and within *Kan* is lightning—
Fire arises within water,
Yin and yang clash, their sound like thunder.
Yet fire must blaze upward, its force erupting from Kunlun.
Though Kunlun is lofty, it holds yin and yang.
If one can harmonize yin and yang,
And return these two substances to one place,
The great medicine ripens naturally, and fragrance fills the body.
This is like jade in the mountains moistening the trees,
Or pearls in the deep keeping the cliffs from withering.

If *Li* and *Kan* lack *wu* and *ji*,
Though they contain the Four Images, no elixir forms.
Only because each holds true earth,
Can the Golden Elixir return.
The *Cantong Qi* says: *Kan* receives *wu* earth, *Li* receives *ji* earth.
*Li* is fire, born of wood—
Wood is the Azure Dragon, fire the Vermilion Bird.
*Kan* is water, born of metal—
Metal is the White Tiger, water the Dark Warrior.
Though *Li* and *Kan* are two trigrams,
They contain the Four Images.
If not paired with the earth of the central palace,
Water and fire clash and cannot form the elixir.
The Four Images are water, fire, wood, and metal,
But the four celestial stems are *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*.
North *zi* is water, and *zi* holds the earthly branch *chou* (ox).
South *wu* is fire, and *wu* holds *wei* (goat).
East *mao* is wood, and *mao* holds *yin* (tiger).
West *you* is metal, and *you* holds *xu* (dog).
Thus, each of the Four Images holds true earth,
And only then can the Golden Elixir return.
This is the meaning of "without *wu* and *ji*, no elixir forms."

The sun dwells in *Li*, yet is called female;
The moon pairs with *Kan*, yet is called male.
If you do not grasp this inversion,
Do not presume to speak loftily of such matters.
The sun is yang, dwelling in the southern *Li* position at *wu*—
It should be male.
Yet it is called female, for *Li* is hollow within—
Yang containing yin.
The moon is yin, paired with the northern *Kan* at *zi*—
It should be female.

Now it is called male, for *Kan* is full within—
Yin containing yang.
As the *Cantong Qi* states: "*Kan* holds the *wu* moon’s essence; *Li* grasps the *ji* sun’s radiance."
When the moon of Great Yin receives the yang of *Kan*’s *wu* water and earth,
Its brilliance shines forth.
When the sun of Great Yang draws upon the yin of *Li*’s *ji* fire and earth,
Its splendor is sustained.
This is the Dao of one yin and one yang,
The elixir of the Five Phases in inversion.
Such profound truths are subtle—
Without a master, none may comprehend.
Should one’s understanding remain shallow,
Discourse on such matters is but empty talk.

Take the solid core of *Kan*’s heart,
And refine the yin within *Li*’s belly.
Thus transformed into the firmness of *Qian*,
All concealment and flight lie within the heart’s command.
The secret of the hollow *Kan* and the replete *Li*—
This is not merely the mutual nourishment of water and fire, the intercourse of heart and kidney.
Its meaning has been expounded in the chapter on inversion through *Li* and *Kan*.
The transformation into the firmness of *Qian* is likewise detailed in the treatise on the union of *Qian*’s family.
Here, it shall not be reiterated.
Yet Master Pingshu further declares that "all concealment and flight lie within the heart’s command,"
For in the *Yijing*, the six lines of *Qian* form the image of six dragons—
A hexagram of pure yang.
The first is concealment; the next, flight—
All governed by the heart’s application.
So too in the refinement of the Golden Elixir:
From pure yin, one smelts pure yang,
Thus equaling the firmness of *Qian*’s body.

The *Zhen* dragon’s mercury emerges from *Li*’s palace;
The *Dui* tiger’s lead is born in *Kan*’s domain.
These two things arise as the child produces the mother—
The Five Phases must all enter the center.
Wood-fluid and metal-essence,
Symbolized as dragon and tiger.
East *Zhen* and west *Dui*—
The ancestral hexagrams are *Kan* and *Li*.
The dragon’s mercury issues from *Li*’s palace—
Wood engenders fire.
The tiger’s lead is born in *Kan*’s palace—
Metal engenders water.
Yet fire does not arise from emptiness—
It must rely on wood.
Water does not exist from nothing—
It depends on metal.
Metal and wood each lie concealed within water and fire—
The mother harbors the child’s embryo.
Though the Five Phases cannot complete their transformation without earth,
Thus each flourishes in the four seasons for eighteen days,
Fulfilling the work of a year.
Moreover, metal and wood are sundered by east and west;
Water and fire stand apart in south and north.
Were it not for the central palace’s virtue of earth to unite them,
They would stray far from the Dao.
Hence it is said:
"Though wood-fluid and metal-essence claim their names,
They meet earth and become three kin."
Again:
"*Li* embraces *ji* earth; *Kan* holds *wu* earth—
Without *wu* and *ji*, no elixir forms."

The red dragon and black tiger converge from west and east,
The Four Images intertwine within *wu* and *ji*.
*Fu* and *Gou* naturally govern their movement—
Who dares say the Golden Elixir cannot succeed?
The dragon is wood;
The tiger is metal.
"Converge from west and east"—
Metal and wood must not be sundered.
The Four Images are the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior.
*Wu* and *ji* are the central palace’s earthly positions.
"Intertwine"—the Four Images unite within the center.
Without *wu* and *ji*, no elixir forms.
*Fu* is the birth of one yang;
*Gou* is the birth of one yin.
If one can, at the inception of yin and yang’s ascent and descent,
Master their movement and harmonize with heaven and earth,
Then how could the Golden Elixir be difficult?
As the Perfected of Yin declared: "The utmost divine and sagely is most effortless."

The White Tiger of Western Mountain rages wild;
The Green Dragon of Eastern Sea cannot be withstood.
Seize them with both hands and force them to battle—
They fuse into a lump of purple gold frost.
The west is *Dui*;
The mountain is earth.
The White Tiger is metal—
Earth engenders metal, its image the tiger.
The east is *Zhen*;
The sea is water.
The Green Dragon is wood—
Water engenders wood, its image the dragon.
Yet the metal tiger lies in the west, the wood dragon in the east—
Their forces are divided; how can this be the Dao?
One must seize these two beasts with both hands and force them into mortal combat,
So that the two qi intermingle and transform into a lump of gold frost.
Though dragon and tiger are but metaphors, and "both hands" a figurative phrase,
They are not truly to be grasped.
One must firmly hold and preserve the spirit,
Taming the wild and subduing the unyielding—
Then the radiant Golden Elixir forms in an instant.

On Mount Hua’s peaks, the male tiger roars;
In Fusang’s depths, the female dragon sings.
The Yellow Dame herself acts as matchmaker,
Bidding them become husband and wife with one heart.
Mount Hua is the western mountain;
The male tiger is hard metal—
The image of earth engendering metal.
Fusang is the eastern sea;
The female dragon is soft wood—
The image of water engendering wood.
East and west stand apart in position;
Metal and wood differ in nature—
They cannot unite as one.
Only when the Yellow Dame’s earth returns to the central palace,
And she herself acts as matchmaker,
Can metal and wood be brought together without separation.
First raise the west, then join the east—
Thus the two things return to one place,
Like husband and wife sharing one heart.

When the moon at heaven’s edge is but a half-wheel bright,
Soon the dragon’s cry and tiger’s roar resound.
Now is the time to refine the two eights—
Within one double-hour, the elixir is complete.
When the moon waxes, its po is full; when it wanes, its wheel is half—
This is the half-catty of metal at the first quarter.
At this moment, the seventh or eighth day,
The moon steals the sun’s yang hun, and its light gradually grows—
Soon the images of dragon’s cry and tiger’s roar appear.
The dragon belongs to *Zhen*—*Zhen* is wood.
The tiger belongs to *Dui*—*Dui* is metal.
Metal can engender water; wood can engender fire.
Metal and wood clash; water and fire wage war.

Thus the dragon must cry and the tiger must roar—
Now is the time to refine the two eights,
And the elixir will surely be achieved.

What are the two eights?
Not the two gates of *mao* and *you*,
Nor the numerical weight of two eights making one catty.
Rather, it is the union of two and eight,
Whose sum is ten—
The great number of Heaven and Earth’s creation,
The summation of the Five Phases’ generation.

Thus Heaven-one engenders water, Earth-six completes it.
Earth-two engenders fire, Heaven-seven completes it.
Heaven-three engenders wood, Earth-eight completes it.
Earth-four engenders metal, Heaven-nine completes it.
Heaven-five engenders earth, Earth-ten completes it.
These numbers—Heaven-one and Earth-two,
Heaven-three and Earth-four,
Heaven-five and Earth-six,
Heaven-seven and Earth-eight,
Heaven-nine and Earth-ten—
Encompass the eternal warp of Heaven and Earth,
Gather the creative transformations of the Five Phases.

For those who cultivate the Dao, to grasp this profound mystery
Is to achieve the elixir’s image in but a moment’s work,
To see the True Person manifest—
What difficulty remains in the completion of the golden elixir?
Thus within one double-hour, the elixir is complete.

*Commentary on the* Wuzhen Pian *of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Scroll Three, Concluded*
*Commentary on the* Wuzhen Pian *of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Scroll Four*

The Cloud-Peak Recluse Xia Zongyu of Yongjia writes:

First observe Heaven to discern the Five Thieves,
Then examine Earth to pacify the people.
When the people are at peace and the state is prosperous, seek the art of war;
Only through victory in war can the Sage be seen.

The discourse on victory in war pertains to the Way of military strategy.
Yet the mystery of cultivating the True—this is the Way of ascending as an immortal.
Pingshu [Zhang Boduan] conflates the two as one;
Will later students not develop misguided views?

The *Yinfu Jing* states: "Heaven has Five Thieves; those who perceive them prosper."
These Five Thieves are: metal overcoming wood, wood overcoming earth,
Earth overcoming water, water overcoming fire, fire overcoming metal—
The Five Phases mutually overcoming one another to complete the Great Dao.
One must gaze upward to Heaven to comprehend the subtlety of this Way,
Then look downward to Earth to pacify the multitudes of the people.

What are the people?
The scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants are the people of the world,
While the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys are the people of one’s body.
The state is like one’s body,
And Earth is like the positions of the five viscera.
If one’s faculties are clear and unobstructed, sight and hearing unimpeded,
The five organs harmonious, with inner and outer nourishment in balance,
Then the body is at peace, the universe settled, and radiance emerges—
Thus the people are at peace, and the state is prosperous.

One must then seek the merit of victory in war,
Yet this does not mean brandishing weapons to engage the enemy,
Nor does it mean recklessly provoking conflict as a lesser defense.
When yin doubts yang, they must battle, and their blood becomes dark and yellow.
Within the human body, yin and yang wage war day and night;
Only the Sage can ensure yang prevails over yin, unshaken by yin’s perverse influences.
This is the art of enriching the state and strengthening the army—
Who but the Sage can achieve this?

When deploying generals, divide them into left and right armies;
Let the other be the host while I am the guest.
I urge you: when facing battle, do not underestimate the enemy,
Lest you lose the priceless treasure of our house.

This poem requires scholars to maintain a mind free of perversity before they can truly perceive its meaning.
The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is formed through the mutual interaction of yin and yang qi.
One left, one right; one guest, one host—
Yet there is also the image of facing battle. Why?
For when yang reaches its extreme, yin arises; when yin reaches its extreme, yang arises.
When yin doubts yang, they must battle, and their blood becomes dark and yellow—
Thus one must employ generals to command the left and right armies.

What is the general? It is the rectified heart-mind.
"Let the other be the host while I am the guest."
What is the host? It is the moment when the first yang stirs.
What is the guest? It is responding to that movement.
Once I respond, there is inevitably an act of confrontation.
I witness thunder roaring and lightning flashing, tigers leaping and dragons soaring,
Merging in a whirlwind, cutting off all profit from a single source,
Deploying forces ten thousandfold—thus the Golden Elixir achieves its work.
Otherwise, if movement and stillness are ill-timed, if one advances recklessly,
Then the great yang will scatter its pearls, its nature fierce and violent,
And the primordial qi will flee—
Is this not the loss of our house’s priceless treasure?

Fire is born from wood, its edge concealed;
Without skillful drilling, do not forcefully attack.
Disaster arises from this self-harm—
One must subdue it to find the Metal Elder.

Wood can generate fire, yet fire hides within wood and does not reveal itself.
Within the human body, there is fire, concealed and unknown even to oneself.
Only those adept at drilling can seize the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth.
Thus, by drilling tinder to change fire, the fire does not depend on blowing but on the work of drilling.
By burning the body to kindle fire, the fire does not rely on external aid but on the Way of cultivation.

The *Yinfu Jing* states: "Fire is born from wood; disaster arises and must be overcome."
Wood is consumed by fire and burns itself; humans are harmed by their own fire.
Only the Sage can subdue this fire, controlling it from its origin—
Thus finding the Metal Elder to overcome wood.
Moreover, metal can generate water, and water can overcome fire.
In this way, wood and fire are no longer our disasters but become our blessings—
Is this not the Way of skillful drilling?

The Metal Elder is originally the son of the Eastern House,
Sent to the Western Neighbor to lodge and grow.
If you recognize and call him back to his dwelling for nurture,
Pair him with the Maiden of Cinnabar in intimate union.

Metal is born in the *si* womb and nurtured in the *mao* [East],
For *mao* belongs to the East—thus metal is the son of the Eastern House.
Metal is tempered in the *you* [West],
And *you* is the West—thus metal lodges in the Western Neighbor.
Though East and West differ in position, metal and wood must unite.
The qi flows back and forth, fundamentally no different—
Like an infant and the Maiden of Cinnabar forming an intimate bond,
What separation remains between the Eastern House and the Western Neighbor?
The two ultimately return to one place to complete the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth.
This is the Way of the Golden Elixir—profound beyond profundity, wondrous beyond wonder.

The Maiden of Cinnabar roams with her own direction:
Her forward path must be short, her rearward path long.
When she returns, she enters the Yellow Dame’s abode,
To wed the Metal Elder as her old husband.

The Maiden of Cinnabar is the Great Yin,
The Great Yin is the lunar essence.
The lunar essence roams with its own direction.
The *Longhu Jing* states: "On the third day, the moon emerges in the *geng* West, dividing at *mao* and *you*."
For *geng* is metal, and the moon is water—
This is the image of metal generating water.
*Geng* belongs to the West;
Every third evening, the sun first sets in the *you* of the West,
While the moon follows, born in the *geng*.
Thus the sun’s path is ahead, while the moon’s path is behind.
Ahead, the light and shadow must be short;
Behind, the light and shadow gradually lengthen.
Short means the solar essence has sunk;
Long means the lunar essence gradually fills.
Whether short or long, day and night depend on one another
To complete the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth.
Only with the Yellow Dame of the Central Palace
Can the Metal Elder be wed as her old husband.
For the Yellow Dame is earth, and earth can generate metal.
Earlier, metal could generate water,
And thus the lunar essence of the Maiden of Cinnabar begins to wax.

Now again, earth can generate metal, its creative transformations boundless—thus the Metal Elder is called the Old Husband. As the *Cantong Qi* says, "Lofty and revered is he."

Though one may recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the firing times, it is as idle as nothing. In all things, cultivation’s power is paramount; the slightest deviation will fail to produce the elixir.

The Great Way of the Golden Elixir involves nothing more than lead and mercury. Lead arises in the North, the true essence of Heaven’s One generating water. Mercury emerges in the South, the wondrous work of Earth’s Two generating fire. Most true, most wondrous—no external borrowing, only the original face, which the common folk use daily yet do not recognize.

It is not the heart and kidneys, not *kan* and *li*, not the water and fire of the human realm, not common lead or common mercury. If one is blessed with innate spiritual bones, grasps the meaning through texts, and pierces the nature of cinnabar and lead, one has already obtained the ingredients for the Golden Elixir. Yet how can this medicine, so numinous, be refined? For example, lead, tin, and quicksilver flee at the sight of fire—how then can the elixir be formed?

Without knowing the firing times, even recognizing cinnabar and lead is of no benefit. For fire is fire, and timing is timing—scholars who conflate the two err. Speaking of external alchemy, there is civil fire and martial fire, inserted fire and lodged fire, celestial fire and the fires of the four cardinal directions, the fire of *jiji* and the fire of *weiji*—no different from the fires of internal alchemy.

Five days make one *hou*, three *hou* make one *qi*, seventy-two *hou* make a year—this is the timing of a full year. From *hai* to *zi* is the yin crossing into yang; from *si* to *wu* is the yang crossing into yin—this is the timing of a single day. When *zi* and *chou* meet, it is the yang crossing into yin; when *chou* and *yin* meet, it is the yin crossing into yang—this is the timing of a single hour. No different from the timing of internal alchemy.

Thus Pengzu said: Though the world may recognize the true nature of cinnabar and lead, they have merely obtained the ingredients for the Golden Elixir. Without understanding the secret of firing times, it is all in vain. One must cultivate with utmost sincerity, without the slightest misstep in timing—only then will the Golden Elixir be achieved. Otherwise, blind practice and reckless refinement, lacking proper transmission, will lead even the smallest error to distance one from the Golden Elixir.

The sages transmit the medicine but not the fire; they do not commit the firing times to writing. As the *Cantong Qi* and other elixir scriptures, songs, and poems expound the truth in exhaustive detail, yet the matter of firing times is never plainly stated in the texts—one must encounter a true master for oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction to attain it once and for all. The supreme Way is not complex, yet fire is fire, and timing is timing—how can the world, in its ignorance, comprehend?

Though fire and timing are two matters, they share a single principle. Though a single principle, they serve two functions. Without the oral instructions, how can one penetrate the mystery? Even if your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without meeting a true teacher, do not presume to guess—thus one must discuss it in detail with the immortals.

On the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s radiance—
This is precisely when the metal essence is at its peak.
When the first yang stirs in revival,
Begin the firing without delay.

The fifteenth of the eighth month marks the midpoint of autumn, when the metal qi is at its height, corresponding to the *dui* trigram. Practitioners of the truth must pay heed at this time. When the first yang revives, the trigram becomes *fu*, the time of the winter solstice—then one must apply effort and begin the firing, without procrastination, lest the moment be lost.

Though Pengzu used this metaphor to illustrate the principle of metal generating water, it does not mean one must wait for the eighth and eleventh months each year to refine the elixir, while the rest of the months are unusable—this is not the case. For within a single day, there is the autumnal peak of metal essence and the winter solstice of yang’s revival. Moreover, yang is born in *kan*, which belongs to water. How can water generate itself? It must be generated by metal. Metal reaches its imperial vigor in *you*—the eighth month. Water reaches its imperial vigor in *zi*—the eleventh month. This is the gathering of years into months, months into days, and days into hours.

When the first yang stirs at the time of elixir-making,
The lead cauldron glows warmly, illuminating the curtains.
At the moment of receiving qi, it is easily obtained—
But in the work of drawing and adding, beware of danger.

The human body shares the same yin and yang as heaven and earth, with yang qi ascending daily from midnight at the *zi* hour and yin qi descending from noon at the *wu* hour. Those who cultivate the truth must activate the celestial mechanism at this time, aligning it precisely—without the slightest deviation, the Way of the Elixir will be achieved.

The "lead cauldron" is the vessel for refining the elixir within the human body. The "curtains" refer to the principle of sealing the *dui* trigram and lowering the veil, as well as Lü Dongbin’s light penetrating the curtains. Thus Pengzu cited these to say: when the first yang arises at the *zi* hour, it is the beginning of receiving qi, the time to make the elixir. If one misses this moment, there will be peril to guard against.

For when lead appears and *gui* water arises, one must swiftly gather it—if gold meets the full moon’s distance, it becomes unfit for tasting.

The Mysterious Pearl takes form as yang is born; when yang reaches its peak, yin’s essence gradually strips away its shape. By the tenth month, frost flies and the elixir ripens—at this moment, when taken into the mouth, even ghosts and spirits are startled.

That which grows loftier the more one looks up, harder the more one drills, appears before the eyes yet suddenly behind—this is the Confucian Mysterious Pearl taking form. Round and luminous, radiant and bright, clear and vivid, lively and fluid—this is the Buddhist Mysterious Pearl taking form. The numinous luminous treasury, illuminating heaven and earth, a single point of true suchness, the empty chamber generating brightness—this is the Daoist Mysterious Pearl taking form.

Though the Three Teachings differ, the Great Dao is one. Yet the Great Dao is formless, giving birth to heaven and earth; the Yellow Emperor’s lost pearl was grasped by the formless. Now it is said the Mysterious Pearl has form—why? Because the Great Dao enters existence from non-being, its form naturally manifests. Thus the image of a single wheel appearing in the deep pool is this form. The True Person emerging of itself is also this form. Called the Mysterious Pearl or Golden Elixir, these are all forms within form, arriving without seeking.

Profound indeed, wondrous indeed—this form can be and not be, can conceal and reveal. When yang begins to rise, the Mysterious Pearl takes form; when the time of yin’s birth arrives, the Mysterious Pearl loses form. Thus it appears at the inception of yang’s peak and vanishes after yin’s extremity. In the *Fu* hexagram, the first yang is born at *zi*, and the Mysterious Pearl takes form. In the *Bo* hexagram, the six yins reach their extreme at *hai*, and the Mysterious Pearl loses form.

Yet only after ten months does the elixir ripen—this is the time when frost flies in biting cold, when the myriad things return to their roots and renew their lives, when yin reaches its limit and yang is born, when the celestial cycle is complete. Only then does the elixir congeal. Thus it is as large as a tangerine, as sweet as honey, the exchanged pear, the fiery jujube—swallowed or spat out like a dragon’s chin pearl, like the ox’s yellow. Lü Dongbin spoke of drinking the *daogui* at that time, for then one’s virtue commands the reverence of ghosts and spirits—how could it not astonish them when taken into the mouth?

After the first crescent and before the last, the medicine’s flavor is mild and its qi complete. Gather it and return to refine it in the furnace; once tempered, nurture it through gentle warming and self-cultivation.

The first crescent refers to the waxing moon of the seventh or eighth day of the lunar month. The last crescent refers to the waning moon of the twenty-second or twenty-third day. What is meant by "crescent"? When the moon first waxes or begins to wane, its shape is half, like the drawn bow of the upper string. At this time, the elixir’s essence is clear and pure, the golden essence robust and flourishing, its flavor mild, and its qi fully manifested. Those who cultivate the Dao must emulate the heavens and model their forms, gathering the golden and watery qi of their own bodies to refine in the spiritual furnace. Through the regulation of fire and the addition or withdrawal of heat, they nurture and temper it, neither losing the balance of water and fire. Thus the golden elixir is achieved—what else need one seek?

The eldest son first drinks the wine of the West,
The youngest daughter first blooms the flower of the North.
If the Green Maiden meets them thereafter,
All will be sealed within the Yellow House.

The eldest son is *Zhen* (☳). The youngest daughter is *Dui* (☱). *Zhen* pertains to wood, *Dui* to metal. The "wine of the West" refers to the West as the direction of metal, and wine as the symbol of water—an analogy for metal giving birth to water. The "flower of the North" refers to the North as the direction of *Kan* water, and the flower as the bloom of lead—an analogy for lead within water. The "Green Maiden" is the green maiden, the wood-mercury. The "Yellow House" is the Yellow Dame, the central palace. As the *Cantong Qi* states: "Cinnabar is the essence of wood; only when it meets metal do they unite." The great Dao takes mutual restraint as its subtlety; metal and wood must not be allowed to separate. If not sealed within the central palace, *Zhen* in the East and *Dui* in the West would have no means of transformation. For wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness, and metal’s essence yearns for wood’s benevolence. Only through mutual absorption and consumption do they become intimate, necessarily borrowing the central palace’s earth to complete the work of creation.

When the months of the Hare and the Rooster arrive at their time,
Punishment and virtue stand at the gate, mirroring the medicine’s form.
At this point, the golden cinnabar must be bathed;
If fire is added further, peril and collapse will follow.

Things at their extreme must reverse—this is the principle and the natural tendency. Thus, in *Qian*’s topmost yang line, the pure yang reaches its limit, and the sage warns of the "arrogant dragon’s regret." Moreover, metal is born in *Si* (☶) and flourishes in *You* (☰). Wood is born in *Hai* (☳) and flourishes in *Mao* (☷). The Hare is *Mao*’s wood; the Rooster is *You*’s metal. Metal governs punishment; wood governs virtue. "Punishment and virtue stand at the gate" refers to *Mao* and *You* as the gates of the second and eighth months, the paths of the sun and moon’s entry and exit, the division of yin and yang, day and night. Since the great Dao takes yin and yang, the sun and moon as its foundation, when it reaches the places of *Mao* and *You*’s extreme flourishing, one must bathe, concentrating the qi to achieve softness, acting without striving, and embracing tranquility. Thus the harmonious primordial yang fills the space between heaven and earth, and this heart has no outward attachment, naturally merging with the Great Void. As it is said: "When the hundred bones are all governed by true non-action, one must not add scorching fire, lest the medicine escape and peril ensue." This is precisely the principle of regulating fire to prevent danger.

The sun and moon meet once every thirty days,
Exchanging days for hours, the method of divine work.
Defending the city or waging wild battle, know fortune and misfortune;
Adding numinous cinnabar, the cauldron fills with red.

Heaven and earth rely on the sun and moon for their work, illuminating the myriad forms without cease, day and night. They must meet at the new moon every thirty days, cycling endlessly without termination. The great Dao employs the golden elixir, refining the crow and smelting the hare, subduing the dragon and taming the tiger. Emulating heaven and modeling its forms, it exchanges hours for days to seize the creative power of heaven and earth, just as the sun and moon unite as one. Thus one attains longevity and avoids death. Yet gathering years into months, months into days, and days into hours, one must firmly guard the city walls, battle and repel demonic obstacles, refrain from idle thoughts, and remain unmoved by desire. Naturally, fortune will come without misfortune. For victory brings fortune, and defeat brings misfortune; fortune brings life, and misfortune brings death. If every battle is won, fortune will be everlasting, and misfortune will vanish. Thus the priceless treasure resides within one’s own body. Like nine-times-refined numinous cinnabar, accumulated day by day and month by month, its red light will penetrate through, moving heaven and earth and startling ghosts and spirits.

When *Pi* and *Tai* first meet, the myriad things flourish;
*Zhun* and *Meng* receive their hexagrams, endowed with life and completion.
Within this, grasp the meaning and do not seek images;
If you exhaust the lines, you will be enslaved by toil.

When heaven and earth unite, it is *Tai*; when they do not, it is *Pi*. The meaning of *Tai* is the image of *Jiji* and *Weiji*. *Zhun* (Water Thunder) teaches the noble one to order and weave; the spring beneath the mountain is *Meng*, teaching the noble one to act resolutely and cultivate virtue. The meanings of *Zhun* and *Meng* represent the initial growth of yin and yang, the very time for cultivating the true and nurturing the essence. Yet those who seek the golden elixir are confused by the regulation of fire, bewildered by the timing of the furnace, and thus apply the sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines as their method, wasting years in vain labor, their hair turning white without achievement. Thus Master Pingshu said: "When heaven and earth first unite, the myriad things flourish. At the initial arising of *Zhun* and *Meng*, one must preserve and nurture the primordial spirit, just as in the time of *Zhun*’s difficulties and *Meng*’s youth, not allowing the slightest external use of the mind. Naturally, one advances in the Dao, and the myriad things of heaven and earth are all contained within the self. How can this not be fulfilling? Why cling to images and numbers, only to be enslaved by the lines?"

Hexagrams set forth images to model forms,
Grasp the meaning, forget the words, and the intent will be clear.
Later generations, deluded, cling only to images,
Practicing hexagram qi in hopes of ascending in flight.

Before the Supreme Ultimate divided, there was a thing formed in chaos—what hexagram image could there be? Only after heaven and earth separated and *Qian* and *Kun* were established did the sages set forth images and draw hexagrams, merely using the sun and moon as the *Yi*. Its purport is profound and subtle; the great Dao lies herein. Yet later scholars, not understanding, cling only to images and practice hexagram qi, using *Zhun* in the morning and *Meng* at night, *Xu* in the morning and *Song* at dusk, dividing the sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines into thirty days, while *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* are left unused. Or, in twenty-nine days, they employ other methods to supplement the hexagrams.

Such practices are truly absurd and self-inflicted toil. How can one employ the hexagram *Zhun* (Water-Thunder) in the morning and claim its efficacy when its image is *Zhun*? How can one employ *Meng* (Mountain-Water) at night and claim its efficacy when its image is *Meng*? As for *Xu* (Water-Heaven) and *Song* (Heaven-Water), what method or standard exists to embody their forms? Yet deluded fools lead one another astray, corrupting the great Dao, and still hope to ascend in flight—how utterly foolish and misguided!

Heaven and earth wax and wane in their own time; only by discerning their ebb and flow can one grasp the subtle mechanism. Since ancient times, the *geng* and *jia* days have enforced the celestial decree, and when the Three Worms are slain, the Dao may be attained. Though heaven and earth are vast, the Dao has its waxing and waning. The great Dao is profound and subtle, its mechanism linked to ebb and flow—this is no mere delusion or idle fantasy.

The human body mirrors heaven and earth; every principle of waxing and waning, ebb and flow, is no different from that of heaven. Thus, at midnight, yang begins to rise; after noon, yin descends. The *geng* precedes the *jia*, their commands strict and clear, so that clarity and brightness reside within, and the spirit’s resolve is as divine. Yet the Three Worms and yin demons disrupt one’s true nature, disorder the blood and qi, and invert deluded thoughts—what place does the Dao have in this? Only by returning from the perverse to the upright, enforcing the *geng* and *jia*, and ensuring the timely interaction of metal and wood, can one grasp the subtle mechanism of ebb and flow, respond to the natural in silence, and slay the Three Worms—then the Dao may be attained.

To keep the Valley Spirit ever undying, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the foundation. Once yang essence returns to the Golden Chamber, a single luminous pearl will forever illumine the six directions, merging with heaven and earth as one.

The Most High said: "The Valley Spirit does not die; this is called the Mysterious Female." The *Spiritual Pivot* states: "The spirit of the empty valley, when guarded, remains true." For the valley is utter emptiness, and the spirit is utmost numinosity. Emptiness enables perfect responsiveness; numinosity enables transformation. This is the way of long life and enduring vision—hence it is called the Valley Spirit, the Spirit Chamber, the Numinous Treasure Repository, the Crystal Palace, the Primordial Yang Temple, or the Great Unity Crucible, all of which are the sites of golden elixir refinement.

Yet the Dao is called the interplay of yin and yang, and the elixir is called the union of the Mysterious and the Female. Before the Primordial Chaos divided, there was a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth. Once the Supreme Ultimate separated, the Two Modes took their places, and the Mysterious Female was established. Now, to keep the Valley Spirit undying and achieve long life and enduring vision, one must rely on the Mysterious and the Female as the foundation, refining and tempering daily, so that yin evil is consumed and yang essence alone remains whole, returning to the Golden Chamber in the Central Palace. Then a single luminous pearl will radiate through the six directions, completing the union with heaven and earth.

The gateway of the Mysterious Female is rarely known; do not mistakenly apply it to the mouth and nose. Though you may practice breath regulation for a thousand years, how can you seize the Golden Crow and the Jade Hare?

The Most High said: "The gateway of the Mysterious Female is the root of heaven and earth." Its meaning is profoundly subtle—how could ordinary people easily comprehend it? Precisely because it is rarely known, some take the nose as the Heavenly Gate, calling it the Mysterious, and the mouth as the Earthly Door, calling it the Female. They exhale the old and inhale the new, taking in more and expelling less, ceaselessly day and night, believing this is the way to attain the Dao. Yet this is merely a method of guiding qi for ease and comfort. Even if practiced for a thousand years, what does it have to do with the great Dao of the golden elixir? Only by causing the Golden Crow and Jade Hare to dance at the gateway of the Mysterious Female, returning to the origin of yin and yang, merging the Two Modes into one, and restoring primordial simplicity, can the sun and moon unite to form the elixir—this is what is meant by "joining virtue with heaven and earth, merging brightness with the sun and moon."

Different names emerge from the same source, yet few know that these two are the subtlest of mechanisms. Preserve nature and complete form by understanding waxing and waning; the Purple Gold True Medicine is wondrous indeed. The Dao is called the interplay of yin and yang, and the elixir is called the union of lead and mercury. Though their names differ, their essence is the same. Their number is two, but their body is one. Few know this, so they fail to grasp the subtlety within subtlety, the mechanism within the essential. If one truly understands, then preserving nature and completing form, clarifying the principles of waxing and waning—what is the tally of fire’s retreat? What is the marker of fire’s advance? Each retreat and advance mirrors the waxing and waning of heaven and earth. When the qi and markers of waxing and waning are unerring, the medicine becomes wondrous beyond imagination. This is called the Purple Gold Elixir, the Numinous Treasure Repository.

At first, when effort is made, few perceive it; only when it becomes effortless do the many recognize it. Yet they see only effortlessness as the essential marvel, unaware that effort is the foundation. The great Dao is effortless, fundamentally the wonder of spontaneity. Heaven says nothing, yet the four seasons proceed, and the myriad things are born—such is its principle. How much more so the profound mystery of the golden elixir, which cannot be sought through intellect or force, nor grasped through form or substance. If called "being," it cannot be met when pursued, nor seen when followed. If called "non-being," it is dim and indistinct, yet within it lies something; it is obscure and profound, yet within it lies essence. Thus, when effort is made, few perceive it, but when it becomes effortless, the many recognize it. This creates a distinction between superior and inferior, with effortlessness deemed the essential marvel. Yet how can they know that effortlessness is the fundamental nature of the Dao, while effort is its foundation? This is not to say that clinging to images and texts, or toiling like a well-sweep, constitutes effort. Nor is it to say that sitting in solitary stillness, like withered wood or dead ashes, constitutes effortlessness.

The highest good is like water, flowing where there is no strife. The supreme Dao is unburdensome, attaining what is inherently possessed. Effortlessness rests in spontaneity, while effort also proceeds spontaneously.

*Commentary on the "Awakening to Reality" by the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Volume Four Concludes*
*Commentary on the "Awakening to Reality" by the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Volume Five*

Cloud Peak Recluse Xia Zongyu of Yongjia writes:

Within black resides white as the Elixir Mother,
The masculine embracing the feminine forms the Sacred Embryo.
When the Great One is guarded within the furnace with utmost care,
The treasures of the Three Fields gather, corresponding to the Three Terraces.

The *Cantong Qi* states: "Know the white, guard the black, and numinous clarity will come of itself."
The *Baopuzi* states: "Guard the feminine, embrace the One, concentrate the qi to attain suppleness—this is the Elixir Mother and Sacred Embryo."

Yet while the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir indeed relies on the mutual support of black and white, the interdependence of feminine and masculine, to achieve the work of the Elixir Mother and Sacred Embryo,
one must know that the primordial qi containing true essence and the treasures gathered in the Three Fields must not be the least bit deficient.
Thus, when treasures gather in the Three Fields and the furnace guards the Great One,
when essence, qi, and spirit are complete and the firing times unerring,
naturally the Sacred Embryo may be formed, the Elixir Mother accomplished,
upward corresponding to the image of the Three Terraces, replete and radiant with light.

Within the elusive and indistinct, an image may be found;
the profound and unfathomable is true essence.
From this, being and non-being mutually enter—
how could one conceive of it before witnessing it?

Gazing, one sees not its color; listening, one hears not its sound; grasping, one cannot seize its form—such is the state of the elusive and indistinct, the profound and unfathomable. What has this to do with the Dao?

Yet within the formless, there is form; within the shapeless, there is shape. From emptiness and fullness, the white emerges; from non-being, being arises. If it is empty, whence comes the white? If it is nothing, whence comes being? This is the mystery within mystery, the wonder within wonder. Without attainment through practice or verification through effect, one cannot speak of it.

Only within the elusive and indistinct, the profound and unfathomable, may one perceive the image of true essence; only within the neither-having-nor-not-having may one see the principle of mutual entry. Then the Dao is within me. If one has not yet seen this, then mere side doors and minor methods—vain imaginings—how can they lead to accomplishment?

When the Four Symbols meet, the mysterious body is achieved;
when the Five Directions move, the purple light shines bright.
Shedding the embryo and entering the mouth, the body attains sagehood,
and countless dragons and spirits are all struck with awe.

The Four Symbols are the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior. The Five Directions are east, west, south, north, and center—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The Great Dao is empty and without form, yet the Golden Elixir is its profound mystery. Though the Golden Elixir is wondrous, it is nothing more than the gathering of the Five Phases and the harmonizing of the Four Symbols. When the Four Symbols unite, the mysterious body is again achieved; when the Five Directions converge, the elixir’s light shines resplendent.

This is not a matter of imagining the heart’s fire or the kidneys’ water, nor of taking the liver as the dragon or the lungs as the tiger. Heaven generates all beings, and humans are born with numinous treasures—the Five Phases gather here, the Four Symbols assemble here. If one practices the mysterious mechanism, then the Great Medicine is refined, the embryo shed and taken into the mouth, transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood. Countless dragons and spirits all rise in reverence and awe—how could they not be utterly astonished? This is the Dao so lofty that dragons and tigers submit, virtue so weighty that ghosts and spirits revere it.

When the swallows of the Flowery Pond depart, the moon’s radiance is clear;
riding a golden dragon, one visits the Purple Tenuity.
From then on, after meeting the host of immortals,
the tides of the sea and the shifting of valleys may change as they will.

The arts of the Golden Elixir, though numbered in the hundreds, hinge upon the divine water and the Flowery Pond. The Flowery Pond is the crucible for refining the elixir, within which divine water flows ceaselessly, day and night. If one obtains this and swallows it, then the moon’s brilliance congeals. This is what the Confucians mean by "uniting brightness with the sun and moon," and what the Buddhists describe as "perfectly round, luminous, and radiant."

Metal is the White Tiger of the west; wood is the Azure Dragon of the east. Now, if one can cultivate the true and ride this golden dragon, then metal and wood will not be separated by decree. One may ascend to the Lord on High, release the primordial spirit—is this not visiting the Purple Tenuity? If one attains this Dao, then one ascends as an immortal, transcending life. Though the seas turn to mulberry fields, what has this to do with me? Thus, one may freely abide amid the shifting of valleys.

Know that the method of refining and nurturing the Returned Elixir
should be to plant the seed in one’s own garden.
No need for forced effort or laborious puffing—
naturally, the fruit ripens and the true embryo is shed.

Humans receive the numinous qi of yin and yang, and thus possess the measure of a full catty of the Great Elixir. If it is not dissipated, one may endure with heaven and earth. Yet the six desires and seven emotions sever one’s celestial authenticity, so that one cannot be certain of the morrow. The supreme sages, in their compassion, bequeathed the method of the Returned Elixir, teaching one to refine and nurture it to exhaust the wonders of the nine returns and seven reversions. This is not something borrowed from the substance of plants or the artifice of humans—it is all a matter of seeking within oneself.

Thus, take the four great elements and the body as one’s garden, yin and yang qi as the seeds. Morning planting, evening harvest; spring growth, autumn withering; flowering, fruiting, the ripening of the fruit, the rounding of the embryo—all occurs in accordance with the natural seasons, in harmony with heaven and earth. There is no need to rely on forced effort or laborious puffing, nor to exhaust oneself with external affairs.

Cease all clever artifice and contrived effort;
recognize the deathless method of another’s house.
In the pot, the life-sustaining wine is ever replenished;
in the tripod, the soul-returning nectar is gathered.

Cultivating virtue brings ease to the heart and daily renewal; contrivance wearies the mind and leads to daily decline. Those who practice the Dao take the true and constant as their heart, uprightness as their thought—thus they turn from perversity to rectitude, emerge from death and enter life. If one resorts to artifice, the heart becomes crooked and thoughts inverted, deluded imaginings arise, and one dwells ever nearer to death.

Though the division between life and death lies in the distinction between truth and falsehood, how then is this attained? Only by ever replenishing the life-sustaining wine within the pot, gathering the soul-returning nectar within the tripod, never allowing the true primordial essence to be depleted or the fundamental power to be exhausted. Like a lamp with oil, like a tree with roots, naturally its radiance shines forth, its branches and leaves flourish abundantly—this is indeed the method of deathlessness, how could it deceive?

On Snow Mountain, a single taste of fine *tiguhu*;
poured into the Eastern Sun’s crucible of transformation.
Should one journey to Kunlun’s northwest,
Zhang Qian would first meet Magu.

This employs imagery as allegory, speaking of the Snow Mountain within the human body that yields the precious flavor of *tiguhu*. The mountain pertains to earth, which generates metal; metal’s qi is cold, hence it is called Snow Mountain. Yet metal is born of earth, its fluid flows forth, sweet in taste and white in hue, resembling *tiguhu*. Only when poured into the Eastern Sun’s furnace—where Eastern Sun pertains to the wood of *jia* and *yi*, and wood contains fire, which can overcome metal—does it become a work of creation. This transformative mystery is profound, beyond the ken of ordinary beings.

If, atop Kunlun’s peak, one encounters the northwest’s metal and water positions, allowing them to generate and restrain one another, seizing the creative power of heaven and earth, then yin and yang find their kindred, naturally uniting in resonance. Like Zhang Qian riding the countercurrent upstream, one may behold the immortal Magu. Zhang Qian represents the yang male; Magu, the yin female—this too is an allegory of union.

Not knowing the yang essence and its host or guest,
how can one discern near from far?
In the chamber, vainly sealing the *weilü* cavity—
how many in Jambudvīpa have been thus misled!

The yang essence governs the hun and shen of the entire body—how could one recognize it? Moreover, there are host and guest, near and far, which require a master’s oral instructions to fathom. Otherwise, merely controlling the chamber and restraining essence by focusing on the *weilü* is mistaken.

Master Yunfang lamented:
*"Alas for the Three Peaks’ Yellow Valley Master—
how many in the Southern Continent have been misled!"*
The Three Peaks refer to the art of yin elixirs, a method for preserving form and abiding in the world, not the Dao of immortals. Yet when people’s qi and blood are unsettled, facing circumstances they cannot forget their passions; though their hearts yearn for the Dao, desire is hard to suppress. Ancient immortals, in their compassion, among the three thousand six hundred gates, also taught methods of essence retention, so that people might understand the ceaseless transformations of life, taking essence, qi, and spirit as their foundation. To grasp them is to preserve; to abandon them is to perish. Applied to others, they can give life; retained within oneself, they can sustain one’s own life. This is no frivolous play, nor is it to be indulged wantonly.

Though the sea is vast, it cannot fill a leaking vessel.
If the *weilü* is not sealed, how can one attain longevity?
Yet without a master’s transmission, many in Jambudvīpa have been misled.

All things flourish and each returns to its root;
returning to the root and reviving the mandate is constant abiding.
Knowing the constant is the wondrous Dao—few comprehend it;
reckless action often brings misfortune, as is often heard.

The *Daodejing* states: *"All things flourish, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called reviving the mandate. Reviving the mandate is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity. Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune."* Master Pingshu’s poem embodies this meaning.

All things arise from their nature and return to their nature—like blossoms and leaves that grow from the root and return to the root, like waves that arise from water and return to water. Once they return, stillness is attained and the mandate revived. Abiding in constancy without delusion, external falsehoods are wholly dispelled; profound stability radiates light, neither shifting with things nor vanishing with transformations. From its origin and its root, it endures unchanging.

Thus the *Zhun* hexagram of the *Yijing* says: *"The sun and moon attain heaven and can shine long; the four seasons transform and can endure long. The sage abides long in the Dao, and the world is transformed and perfected."* The timeliness of *zhun* is truly great! How could ordinary people comprehend this?

Yet because it is difficult for people to grasp, they often act recklessly and invite misfortune, bringing turmoil upon themselves. Thus to "violate the constant," "alter the constant," or "deviate from the constant" brings misfortune, never fortune.

Ouye received the sword-forging method in person,
matching Ye Stream’s metal and water to temper hardness and softness.
Once refined, it understands its wielder’s intent—
a thousand miles away, it slays evil in a flash of lightning.

Ouyezhi, a rustic scholar of ancient times, forged swords worth a thousand gold—not by any other means, but by the mutual generation of metal and water, the harmonizing of hardness and softness, refined a hundred times to become unmatched in the world. As an analogy for the great Dao of the golden elixir, this is the method of forging swords. Speaking of the human body, in the land of Ye and Han there are the substances of metal and water, the functions of hardness and softness. If one obtains a master’s refining, its edge is irresistible. Naturally, it becomes luminously responsive, discerning things as they arise, perceiving affairs as they occur. Though evil and obstinacy may be a thousand miles away, they can be subdued beneath a flash of lightning. This clarity that sees a thousand miles, its cold radiance and true color, are all natural secondary effects.

Knocking bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow the jade fungus,
strumming the zither to call the phoenix to drink the *daogui* pellet.
Lately, golden light has suffused my body—
I speak not of this mechanism to ordinary people.

This employs imagery as allegory, alluding to the substances within the human body. The bamboo and zither, when struck, produce sound; the turtle and phoenix share similar forms. The jade fungus and *daogui* pellet are alike—both born of harmonious qi, products of metal and earth.

Though the names differ in six ways, their fundamental nature is but three. Speaking of the great Dao as non-action, it initially requires no deliberate effort; yet when tally and tally correspond, when qi and resonance align, within non-action there is action—responding to the mechanisms of heaven and earth, all through the Dao of natural resonance and union.

Thus, within the human body, a single substance: when struck like bamboo, the turtle may be summoned; when strummed like a zither, the phoenix may be called. All is resonance of sound and qi, response of breath and breath—swift as echo and shadow. When harmonious qi naturally brings forth auspiciousness, the jade fungus may be swallowed, the *daogui* pellet may be drunk. Its joints and vessels, its veins and textures, all flow unimpeded from top to bottom. Qi of the same kind summons one another, requiring no extra effort to manifest its efficacy.

Rightly so, golden light suffuses the body, present within and manifest without—like jade in the mountain that moistens the trees, like a pearl in the deep that keeps the cliffs from withering. Most profound, most wondrous—how could one speak of such mysteries to the vulgar?

Only when medicine meets its kindred qi does it take form;
the Dao, in its rarity and stillness, accords with nature.
A single grain of numinous elixir swallowed into the belly—
then one knows my fate is not ruled by heaven.

Like sounds resonate, like qi seeks its kind. The great medicine of the golden elixir arises from nothing but lead and mercury. Lead can transform mercury, and mercury in turn transforms lead. Seven returns, nine refinements—this is the external elixir.

That which cannot be seen is called *xi* (rare);
that which cannot be heard is called *yi* (still).
The great Dao of *xi* and *yi* emerges from nature—
it is the Dao of clarity and quiescence, non-action: this is the internal elixir.

With the internal elixir to refine the spirit,
there must also be the external elixir to refine the form,
so that both form and spirit attain wondrous union, merging with the true Dao.
A single grain of elixir, numinous and wondrous in its workings,
naturally transcends the mortal to enter sagehood,
passes from death into life—
is this not "my fate lies with me, not with heaven"?

The radiant cinnabar elixir may be completed in a day—
the ancient immortals’ words are truly worth heeding.
If one speaks of nine years or three years,
it is all but procrastination and delay.

The great Dao of the golden elixir is the supreme vehicle to immortality—
ought it not be most difficult?
Yet Lü Dongbin (Pure Serenity) declared it could be achieved in a day—
how could this be so?
He also said: "All comes down to a moment’s effort,
yet it secures boundless ease and joy forever."
Thus we know Yin Zhenren’s words: "The most divine and sagely is most effortless."
Believe these words, and the supreme Dao is not burdensome—
it is no mere side path of many affairs.
In a moment, in a day, the Dao is perceived as present.
To speak of nine years or three is but to delay one’s own progress.
That which is grasped is preserved; that which is released is lost—
without fixed time, without known direction—
such is far from the Dao.

Yanzi’s feigned foolishness,
Zengzi’s single-minded "yes,"
Xiangyan’s striking of bamboo,
Shancai’s snapping of fingers—
even Confucians and Buddhists strive for it.
How much more, then, to ascend to immortality from the common,
to transcend the mortal and enter sagehood—
could this not be achieved in a day?

The great medicine’s cultivation may be easy or difficult—
know that it depends on fate, yet also on heaven.
If one has not accumulated deeds and bestowed hidden virtue,
at every turn demonic obstacles arise to block the way.

Man stands with heaven and earth as the Three Powers—
why then do men often die young, while heaven and earth endure without end?
Those who understand know:
one must cultivate the great Dao of the golden elixir,
to match heaven and earth in their completion.
Is this a trifling matter?
Thus, to cultivate the Dao of immortality,
one must first cultivate the Dao of man.
If one is ashamed in the Dao of man,
the Dao of immortality remains distant.

What is the Dao of man?
Only to accumulate deeds to save others,
to harbor hidden virtue in the world—
like heaven and earth’s all-covering and all-bearing, without a trace of selfishness;
like the Supreme Emperor’s love of life, without a thought of killing.
Thus, looking up, one feels no shame; looking down, one commits no wrong—
then heaven naturally protects, and all is auspicious.
If one cultivates the great medicine to seek immortality,
the Dao is most easy—all depends on oneself.
But if one feels shame in the hidden chamber,
deceives in the dark,
then demonic obstacles arise daily,
and the path becomes most difficult.
Indeed, it is not inherently difficult—
it is that heaven cannot tolerate it.
Not that heaven is at fault,
but that one lacks virtue to align with heaven’s heart.
Can those who study the Dao not seek the easy and discard the difficult?

The Three Powers mutually consume in their time;
the *Dao* and *De*, the *Yinfu*, reveal the sacred mechanism.
When the myriad transformations are at peace and all concerns cease,
the hundred bones are all ordered—proof of non-action.

The *Yinfu Jing* says:
"Heaven and earth are the thieves of the myriad things;
the myriad things are the thieves of man;
man is the thief of the myriad things."
It also says: "Consume in their time, and the myriad transformations are at peace."
This has been explained in detail in the *Lecture on the Yinfu Jing*.
Yet Pure Serenity further expounds on the proof of non-action:
though the ceaseless transformations of generation and decay, waxing and waning,
may seem like many affairs,
the great Dao is impartial—
nothing is not the principle of nature.
If one can fill oneself with this and put it to use,
the mind mirrors the great void, and all concerns naturally cease;
qi embraces the primordial beginning, and the hundred bones harmonize.
The Dao of non-action may be realized in the immortal realm of the Great Clarity.

The precious words of the *Yinfu* exceed three hundred;
the numinous script of the *Daode* fills five thousand.
Immortals past and present are without number—
all have grasped the true meaning here.

How profound! The great Dao is hard to transmit,
and does not rely on written words.
Yet jade tablets and golden oracles, divine chapters and precious scrolls,
stand arrayed like a martial arsenal,
complete as a comprehensive tortoise-shell divination.
From what should the student of the Dao draw verification?
Only within the most complex lies the principle of utmost simplicity;
within the most detailed, the use of utmost essentiality.
Is it not that the Yellow Emperor’s *Yinfu Jing*, with its words exceeding three hundred,
and the Supreme Venerable One’s *Daode Jing*, with its text filling five thousand,
contain the profound subtleties of the great Dao, leaving nothing untouched?
Immortals past and present who ascend to the golden towers,
who wander and feast in the jade capital,
are beyond counting—
yet all have grasped the true meaning of these two classics,
attained their wondrous use.
Students must not ignore their essentials
while seeking side paths among the three thousand six hundred.

It is like the hundred schools of thought, the miscellaneous records and commentaries—
filling houses, straining oxen—
their number is beyond reckoning.
Yet the Dao of the Six Classics all returns to the simple principle of qian and kun.
So too the great Dao of the golden elixir does not exceed the two classics:
the *Yinfu* and the *Daode*.

Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min’s,
without meeting a true master, do not strain to guess.
For the elixir classics lack oral transmissions—
where then can you conceive the numinous embryo?

The great Dao is one,
yet its teachings divide into three.
Trace them from the three,
and a thousand gates, ten thousand doors unfold—
a thousand scriptures, ten thousand discourses,
their limits beyond reckoning.
Yet follow the one to thread them all,
and heaven gains its clarity,
earth its tranquility,
humankind its life—
the supreme Dao is not complex.

Yet that their limits are beyond reckoning
seems difficult, but is in truth easy.
If you possess a nature of keen intelligence and wisdom,
you may penetrate widely, master broadly,
as if nothing remains untouched.
Only the principle that the supreme Dao is not complex—
though it seems easy, is in truth hard.
Even with the talents of Yan and Min,
you may not awaken to it alone.
You must meet a sagely teacher, a perfected one,
who transmits the oral instructions,
points out the celestial mechanism—
then with a single word, the matter is grasped,
in an instant, the work is done,
the numinous embryo may be conceived,
and the great Dao attained.

The root-source is clear, the trigger lies in the square inch.
When the three thousand deeds are complete, your merit equals heaven.
Naturally, there is a crucible to refine dragon and tiger—
why cling to home, yearn for wife and child?

The root-source is clear,
the trigger lies in the square inch.
When the three thousand deeds are fulfilled,
your merit equals heaven.
What is this square inch?
It is this heart.
What is this equality with heaven?
It is also this heart.
The heart is the lord of heaven,
sovereign over the ten thousand images.
If you are inwardly luminous, utterly unstained,
cultivating the true and upholding the Dao,
fulfilling the three thousand deeds—
though the heavenly Dao is profound and unfathomable,
you will stand before it without shame,
a companion to heaven.
Naturally, there is a crucible to refine the golden elixir,
where dragon coils and tiger crouches,
the dharmic image shines forth,
its medicine boundless.
Why remain mired in the dust of the world,
deluded by love and attachment,
burdened by family, bound to wife and children,
to rot with the grasses and trees?

Before refining the returning elixir, refine it swiftly.
Once refined, know when to stop and be content.
If you cling to abundance with an insatiable heart,
you may yet one day meet ruin and disgrace.

The method of the returning elixir
is the Dao of long life and enduring vision.
How can the worldly, bound to dust and custom,
fathom its wonders?
Only those of immortal wind and Daoist bone
can know the method of cultivation.
Yet the medicine, the fire-timing,
the operations of withdrawal and addition—
must accord with heaven and earth.
Do not know advance but not retreat,
know action but not cessation.
Thus, before refining the returning elixir,
hasten to cultivate—
as Master Lü said, “To begin swiftly is already too late.”
Once refined, guard it well,
do not recklessly add fire-timing.
If the fire-timing is amiss,
the sun’s flowing pearl—
fierce and violent in nature—
will ever seek to leave you.
One day, it may spill and be lost,
bringing ruin and disgrace.
As Zhongli said, “When the medicine is ripe,
do not apply fire-timing—
to do so would harm the elixir.”
From this, we see:
Those who do not know cultivation
are like those who do not weed their sprouts.
Those who know cultivation but do not know when to stop
are like those who pull the sprouts to help them grow.
How can one not be cautious?

Know that the gate of death is the gate of life—
do not cling to the gate of life as the gate of death.
If you grasp the mechanism of killing and reversal,
you will see that harm contains the seed of grace.

Life is the root of death,
death is the root of life.
Grace arises from harm,
harm arises from grace.
This is the teaching of the *Yinfu Jing*.
Master Lü’s verse merely elucidates its depths.
For metal is born in *si*, dies in *zi*.
*Zi* is the realm of water,
yet metal can generate water.
Wood is born in *hai*, dies in *wu*.
*Wu* is the realm of fire,
yet wood can generate fire.
Water and earth are born in *shen*, die in *mao*.
*Mao* is the position of wood,
yet water can generate wood.
Thus, life is the root of death,
death is the root of life.
Yet while the root of life and death is fixed,
the meaning of grace and harm differs.
Only the transformations of metal and fire
cannot be judged by life and death.
The *Longhu Shangjing* says:
“Metal and fire are the true medicine.”
In the art of the elixir, nothing is more manifest than metal and fire.
For fire is born in *yin*, dies in *you*.
*You* is the realm of metal—
this fire can only overcome metal,
how can it generate metal?
Moreover, *you* is the realm where metal flourishes,
while fire is in its place of death.
Unable to overcome it as harm,
metal instead receives its flourishing as grace.
The *Cantong Qi* says:
“When metal enters the fierce fire,
its color does not lose its radiant light.”
Is this not grace born from harm?
This is the principle of reversal in the mechanism of killing—
without penetrating insight into the transformations of the five phases,
it cannot be known.
Some mistakenly take the gate of life and gate of death
as the yin and hidden places of women,
and “grace born from harm” as the art of sexual union that harms virtue.
This is wrong.
The great Dao is pure and tranquil, fundamentally undefiled—
how could filthy conduct lead to immortality?

Fortune and misfortune arise in mutual dependence,
like echo following sound, shadow following form.
If you can turn this mechanism of life and killing,
disaster transforms into blessing in the turn of a palm.

Fortune leans upon misfortune,
misfortune lurks within fortune—
like echo answering sound, shadow following form,
it cannot be ignored.
If one learns the Dao and cultivates the true,
virtue and fortune grow lofty,
life endures, vision persists,
one becomes an immortal among mortals—
this is the wondrous Dao of emerging from death and entering life.
But if one turns from the Dao and harms life,
indulging in sensual pleasures,
one becomes a walking corpse, a moving privy,
hastening only to decay and ruin.
The mechanism shifts from life to killing,
fortune turns to disaster—
as easily as turning a palm.
From this, we see:
“Following the good brings fortune,
following the perverse brings misfortune”—
like echo and shadow,
the Confucian and Daoist scriptures share the same principle.

Cultivate while mingling with the world, harmonizing your light.
Round when round, square when square.
Manifest or hidden, yielding or resisting—
none can fathom your conduct or concealment.
How can others discern your actions or retreat?

The great hermit dwells in the world,
the lesser hermit dwells in the mountains—
why?
The world is the marketplace,
yet the cultivator of the true who dwells there,
with a mind unmoved, pure and unadulterated,
cannot be swayed by wine, sex, wealth, or anger,
nor altered by riches or honor, fame or achievement—
this is why it is called the great hermitage.

As for mountains—secluded wilds of forests and foothills—hermits dwelling there may indeed harbor no stray thoughts. Yet when they emerge and encounter the flourishing world, the mere sight of what is desirable stirs the common passions, and cravings surge as before. This is why it is called the lesser hermitage.

Master Pingshu said: The cultivator must mingle with the world, never adopting conduct that sets them apart. They harmonize their light and merge with the dust, adapting to roundness or squareness as circumstances demand, embracing all without attachment, now manifest, now hidden, now yielding, now resisting—like clouds drifting unimpeded, beyond others’ comprehension. Serene as the vast heavens, unburdened by the myriad forms, this is how one attains the Dao.

Those who flaunt their uniqueness, seeking to astonish the world with extraordinary deeds, reveal their conduct and concealment to others. Not only do they fail to accomplish the Way, but few escape harm in the world. Thus, at the close of the sixty-four poems, the teaching is emphatically imparted to later learners.

*Commentary on the "Awakening to Reality" by the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Fifth Chapter of Spring, concludes.*

*Commentary on the "Awakening to Reality" by the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Scroll the Sixth*
*Written by Xia Zongyu of Yongjia, the Cloud Peak Recluse*

**Five-Word Quatrain**—Its first line aligns with the number of the Great Unity.
A maiden dons azure robes,
Her lord dons silken white.
Seen, it cannot be employed;
Employed, it cannot be seen.
In the dim and vague, they meet,
In the deep and dark, change arises.
In a flash, flames take flight—
The Perfected One appears of itself.

Master Pingshu’s poem employs the method of the Great Unity’s number. The profound subtleties of the Great Dao are fully revealed, yet without a teacher’s transmission, even the wise and discerning will struggle to fathom it. Now, the maiden is yin; the lord is yang. Azure robes are the wood of the east, Jia and Yi; silken white is the metal of the west, Geng and Xin. Male and female differ in form, yin and yang in qi, metal and wood in essence, east and west in position—how could these be the Dao? Only the sage harmonizes and unites them, causing male and female, yin and yang to interact within the central palace, metal and wood, east and west to merge upon the Yellow Way. When the maiden dons azure robes, yin can bear yang; when the lord dons silken white, yang can embrace yin. Naturally, harmony accumulates within, brilliance radiates without; the empty chamber generates brightness, fullness shines with splendor. Thus, *seen, it cannot be employed; employed, it cannot be seen*—this is precisely the Confucian and Daoist principle of standing tall and resolute. To stand is to see it before one—this is the meaning of *seen*. Yet when one gazes ahead, it suddenly appears behind; though one wishes to follow, there is no way—this is *cannot be employed*. The Buddhist’s *perfectly round, radiant, luminous, and free* is the meaning of *employed*, while its *cool wisdom, wondrously complete, body naturally empty and still* is *cannot be seen*. The Most High said: *Dim and vague, within it there is something*; thus, meeting in the dim and vague is not without perception. *Deep and dark, within it there is essence*; thus, change within the deep and dark is not without use. Preserving the insubstantial while guarding the substantial, in an instant it is accomplished—most divine, most effortless. Is this not *in a flash, flames take flight, the Perfected One appears of itself*? Thus, a body is born beyond the body, nature is seen upon nature; coming and going are free, the original face is recognized. Therefore, from this ordinary fire arises true fire, from this ordinary person emerges the Perfected One. Yet is the dim and vague truly so? From nothing arises something, from something arises nothing—mystery within mystery, wonder within wonder. One may speak of it with immortals, but it is hard to speak of it with the mortal-boned.

**Twelve *Xijiangyue* Poems**—Corresponding to the twelve months.
The inner elixir resembles the outer,
The inner must connect with the outer.
The cinnabar head’s benefits and harms are roughly the same;
Nurturing employs two methods.

Within, there is the celestial true fire,
The crucible glows with enduring crimson.
The outer furnace’s increase and decrease require diligent effort—
No wonder surpasses the true seed.

The essential Dao of immortal cultivation lies in refining the golden liquid and returning elixir. Yet the elixir is divided into inner and outer, and nurturing employs two methods. Both must be harmonized to transcend the mortal and enter the sagely. If there is inner elixir but no outer elixir, the physical form—composed of father’s essence and mother’s blood, the four great elements provisionally combined—remains a mortal shell, heavy and stagnant, without transmutation. How could one attain the Dao? If there is outer elixir but no inner elixir, though the great medicine is wondrous, it remains external, a mere thing. Seeking within, the celestial true has been depleted, spirit exhausted, qi scattered, essence and spirit dull. Applying the outer elixir is like boiling an empty cauldron—it only hastens ruin, never achieving transformation. Master Pingshu’s verses first clarify the inner and outer elixirs. Does he not understand the Dao? Moreover, the outer elixir uses only lead and mercury, with no杂 or impurities. The five metals, eight stones, herbs, and decayed matter are all excluded. Through fire phases of withdrawal and addition, emulating heaven and earth’s patterns, prolonged refinement circulates qi through the celestial cycles, and one may become a treasured immortal. As the scripture says: *Once the great medicine is complete, magpies feeding become phoenixes, crows eating become simurghs, dogs licking become dragons, and humans consuming ascend as immortals.* As for the inner elixir within the body—neither heart nor kidney, neither lung nor spleen, neither qi nor essence, neither blood nor fluid—it is also nothing but lead and mercury, yin and yang paired. Refined with true fire and primal yang, it mirrors the outer elixir, causing the crucible to glow crimson. Following the proper times for increase and decrease, one refines it into a purely yang substance, casting no shadow at noon. Only then may one ingest the outer elixir, making both form and spirit wondrous, merging with the true Dao, shedding the mortal shell, and ascending in broad daylight. Thus, *the inner elixir resembles the outer; the inner must connect with the outer*—one cannot be partial and incomplete. Yet why are the true seed the same, while nurturing employs two methods? What is shared is lead and mercury; the difference lies in the fire phases. For the outer elixir, one uses ordinary charcoal and human-made fire; for the inner elixir, one employs the celestial true fire.

**Xijiangyue**
This Dao is most divine, most sagely—
I fear your meager fate cannot endure it.

Harmonizing lead and mercury takes not even a morning—
soon the mystic pearl’s form appears in omen.
If the aspirant can cultivate and refine,
why should one not dwell in market or court?

The work is easy, the medicine not distant—
speaking of it, people must break into laughter.
How profound! In five hundred years, qi gives birth to the worthy,
none but earth’s spirits and humanity’s heroes.

Of those who embody virtue, merit, literature, and governance—
those who aid their lords and benefit the people—
the world is never lacking.
Yet those who are most divine, most sagely,
becoming immortals among men,
whose yin merits and yang virtues align with Heaven’s heart,
who ascend in broad daylight—
such persons are truly rare.

If one is not born with numinous bones,
profound fortune, and a destiny to encounter a sagely teacher,
how could one attain this?
Yet the divine and sagely Way of the golden elixir
is nothing more than two substances: lead and mercury.
Once fire phases are harmonized,
in but a moment the mystic pearl’s form appears in omen.

The determined aspirant, if diligent in cultivation,
knows no distinction of noble or base.
In court, one may still govern the state and pacify the realm;
in the marketplace, one does not lose the work of scholar, farmer, artisan, or merchant.
As the earlier poem says:
*Do not rashly abandon your wife, vainly severing yin and yang’s bond;
do not starve yourself, pointlessly emptying stomach and bowels.
The five viscera—heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys—
are wearied by vain visualization;
the seven treasures—tears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, blood, humor—
are squandered in futile swallowing and spitting.*

All the three-year, nine-year regimens,
the three thousand six hundred heterodox methods—
none are of use to the golden elixir.
Alas! The Way is most divine, most sagely;
the medicine is easy, not distant.
As the saying goes: *The Way lies before one’s eyes, yet people do not see it;
speak of it, and they laugh—what doubt remains?*
The Most High said:
*When lesser men hear the Dao, they laugh greatly.
If they did not laugh, it would not be the Dao.*

**Xijiangyue**
The White Tiger’s *First Scripture* is the supreme treasure;
the Flowery Pond’s divine water is true gold.
Thus we know the highest good’s beneficent source runs deep—
not to be compared with ordinary medicines.
To forge it requires ninefold refinement,
first requiring the tempering of the self and mastery of the mind.
Follow the times to gather and determine ascent and descent;
advance the fire while ever guarding against peril.

The White Tiger is the essence of metal.
The *First Scripture* is the primal valley spirit.
The supreme treasure is the luminous treasury of awareness.
The Flowery Pond is the crescent-moon furnace.
Divine water is the water of numinous clarity.
True gold is the great medicine of the golden elixir.
The highest good is the peerless, wondrous Way.
The beneficent source is the inexhaustible wellspring.
Ninefold refinement is the nine-returned golden body.
Tempering the self and mastering the mind is the leakless body of the seven treasures.
Gathering has its time; taking has its day.
Ascent and descent are the two substances of yin and yang’s rising and falling.
Advancing the fire and guarding against peril means that once the elixir is ripe, fire phases need not be applied.
An ancient immortal said:
*The arts of the golden elixir number in the hundreds,
but their essence lies in divine water and the Flowery Pond.*
Yet Heaven engenders water—how could water arise naturally?
Only metal can generate water.
Metal is indestructible, enduring for ten thousand ages.
Receiving Heaven’s true qi of the One, it gives birth to water—
thus the essence of metal is the *First Scripture* and supreme treasure.
Once the Flowery Pond engenders divine water,
divine water in turn engenders true gold—
this is what is meant by *the mother hidden in the child’s womb*,
the *water-borne metal*, the *lead of the watery realm*.

The Most High said: *The highest good is like water.*
*The Classic of the Unseen Correspondence* says: *Cut off profit at its source.*
Lü Dongbin said: *To return the elixir sevenfold,
one must first refine the self and await the time.*
Only when essence, qi, and spirit are complete,
the three fields full,
and one’s virtue merged with Heaven and Earth—
only then, in the rising and falling of yin and yang,
on that day of the month, at that hour of the day,
gently gather, neither exceeding nor falling short,
determining ascent and descent—
can one seize Heaven and Earth’s creative power,
aligning the mechanism with perfect accord, not erring by a hair’s breadth.
Once the elixir is accomplished,
guard tranquility and nurture qi;
do not recklessly advance the fire.
Immortal Zhongli said:
*Once the elixir is ripe, fire phases need not be applied;
if fire is still added, danger will overturn the hexagram.*

**Xijiangyue**
Seven returns—cinnabar returns to its root;
nine returns—the golden body returns to truth.
Do not reckon by *yin* and *zi* to *kun* and *shen*;
only observe the completion of the Five Agents.
It is originally but a single taste of mercury,
circulating through all the celestial stems.
When yin and yang’s qi are full, it naturally becomes numinous—
in its comings and goings, how could it depart from the Mysterious Female?

The discourse on seven returns and nine returns
is the profound mystery of the great Way of the golden elixir.
Without encountering a sagely teacher, scholars idly speculate,
some even counting from *zi* to *shen* as nine returns,
from *yin* to *shen* as seven returns—this is incorrect.
*The Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* says:
*In the clarity of elixir arts, nothing surpasses metal and fire.*
Metal and fire are the sun and moon’s souls and spirits.
In the first half of the month, on the third day, the moon begins to generate its spirit—
its body belongs to metal.
Metal’s number is four, its completion number nine—
thus it is said: *On the third day, the Dui gate opens anew,
and from the black-silver crucible emerges white silver.*
This is the arising of metal’s qi, called the *nine returns*.
In the latter half of the month, the spirit’s light gradually wanes,
and the day when the sun receives the tally is called *fire*,
also named cinnabar—red without, white within.
It steals the moon’s light, augmenting the sun’s true fire.
Fire’s number is two, its completion number seven—
thus it is called the *seven returns*.
Yet though the meaning of return lies in metal and fire,
tracing their source, they are originally but a single taste of mercury.
For Heaven engenders water—water is the elixir’s mother.
All movement in Heaven and Earth,
the rising and falling of sun and moon,
occur within the water wheel.
The yin-yang transformations of the human body
lie in the watery realm of Kan.
From the first yang’s arising at *zi*,
to the descent of yin after *wu*,
revolving and beginning anew,
passing through all the celestial stems,
when the qi of the celestial cycle is full,
it naturally becomes numinous.
Yet in its comings and goings,
how could it depart from the Mysterious Female?

The Valley Spirit never dies—
this is called the Mysterious Female.
The gate of the Mysterious Female
is the root of Heaven and Earth.
Such is the profound mystery of the Golden Elixir.

*To the tune of "Moon over the West River"*
If you would have true lead retain mercury,
within kinship, they never leave as lord and minister.
Wood and metal, though sundered, meet without cause—
a go-between must draw them near.

Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,
metal’s essence cherishes wood’s kindness.
They devour each other, yet grow intimate—
only then is there conception within the void.

In refining the Golden Elixir,
nothing lies beyond lead and mercury.
Yet mercury, prone to flight, is hard to retain—
only when true lead is obtained can mercury be held fast.
For they are conjoined by a single qi,
kin within the household, never of different kind,
naturally drawn to each other in devotion.
Alas! Once the Great Simplicity divides,
east as *Zhen* and west as *Dui*,
wood and metal stand apart, meeting without cause.
Now, through the elixir’s method, a go-between must draw them near—
this is the Yellow Dame.
The principle of union employs the central office of earth.
For earth engenders metal, metal restrains wood,
and wood restrains earth—
three natures of distinct substance,
devouring each other yet growing intimate.
This is the method of inverting the Five Phases.
As the *Scripture of Unconscious Unison* says:
"Within harm, kindness is born."

The Immortals’ scriptures say:
"Following the sequence, one becomes human;
reversing it, the elixir is employed."
For what generates in sequence is kindness,
while what restrains in reversal is harm.
"Only then is there conception within the void"—
for the substances of metal and wood differ in outer form,
yet wood’s liquid and metal’s essence inwardly resonate in qi,
as when one "chips open the marrow of chaos,
splits forth the essence of *Kan* and *Li*."
From this, the elixir is made—
thus conception within the void may be known.
As the Most High says:
"Vague and indistinct,
yet within it there is something."
What is this if not conception?

*To the tune of "Moon over the West River"*
Whose is the maiden of two eights?
Where is the gentleman of nine threes?
They call themselves wood’s liquid and metal’s essence—
when they meet earth, the three natures form.

With Ding Gong’s forging and refining,
husband and wife at last unite in joy.
The River Chariot dares not tarry—
it carries them to the summit of Kunlun Peak.

The two eights are the number of yin.
The maiden is the yin woman.
The nine threes are the number of yang.
The gentleman is the yang man.
Wood’s liquid is the liquid of the *Zhen* dragon of the east,
the image of water engendering wood.
Metal’s essence is the essence of the white tiger of the west,
the image of metal engendering water.
Earth is the central office of *Wu* and *Ji*.
Ding Gong is the fire’s timing.
The River Chariot is the true qi of the north,
the image of the River Chariot’s conveyance.
Kunlun is the divine chamber of the Mud Pill Palace.

In this passage, Master Puzhao has expounded the true ground of the Golden Elixir—
its firing times, medicines, and substances—
yet out of compassion for those who might not grasp it,
he has left it obscure.
Now, the purely yang is Heaven and the immortal;
the purely yin is Earth and the ghost.
That which holds both yin and yang is the human.
Moreover, the Way is called the union of one yin and one yang.
What continues it is goodness;
what completes it is nature.
The *Great Change* speaks of this profoundly—
how is it different from the Way of the Golden Elixir?
For the Golden Elixir within the human body
lies in nothing beyond the workings of yin and yang.
Thus, in terms of numbers, there are two eights and three nines;
in terms of people, there are the gentleman and the maiden;
in terms of the Five Phases, there are metal and wood;
in terms of the Four Images, there are the dragon and the tiger;
in terms of human affairs, there are husband and wife.
A thousand chapters and ten thousand verses—
all are but metaphors and allegories, nothing more.

From the primordial ancestral qi,
chaos was one.
Once the Great Ultimate divided,
it separated into two.
Because of this division,
odd and even differ in number,
male and female differ in body,
metal and wood differ in substance,
east and west differ in direction,
dragon and tiger differ in image.
Now, if one wishes to return to the origin and refine the elixir,
one must unite the disparate and return to the same.
Without returning to the central office,
how could the two merge into one?
Thus it is said: when they meet earth, the three natures form—
this is the place where the Yellow Dame arranges the match.
Though the two substances have form and substance,
how could they truly become one?
It is only through the resonance of essence and liquid,
the blending of spirit and qi,
the subtle communion across barriers—
like a lodestone drawing iron—
that a single point of true yang’s numinous clarity shines through.
Thus, it is not called "wood" but "wood’s liquid,"
not "metal" but "metal’s essence"—
the meaning is profound.
Yet how could metal and wood naturally possess essence and liquid?
They must rely on Ding Gong’s forging and refining,
the firing times of withdrawal and addition—
only then can yin and yang unite in marriage,
only then can metal and water form the elixir.
This fire is not the wind-fire of *Xun*,
nor the heart-fire of *Li* at noon,
but the true qi of the *Kan* palace in the north,
called the River Chariot’s ceaseless conveyance,
ascending straight to the summit of Kunlun Peak in the Mud Pill Palace.
A single point of true yang illumines the cosmos—
this is "sinking to the sea’s depths,
embracing the sun’s rising."
Striking through the Three Passes,
piercing the highest realm,
the radiant Golden Elixir forms at the moment of metal and wood’s union.
How distant then is the immortal’s Way?

**Cloud Peak Recluse Xia Zongyu of Yongjia’s "Moon Over the West River"**

*"The Cowherd and Weaver Girl’s love is the Dao’s root,
Tortoise and Serpent’s kindred nature heaven-bestowed.
Toad and Crow meet at the dark moon’s embrace,
The two qi mutually sustain their revolving dance.

All is the marvelous work of Qian and Kun—
Who fathoms this profound abyss?
When yin and yang are sundered, fault arises,
How then can heaven endure, earth abide long?"*

The Cowherd and Weaver Girl signify the union of husband and wife. The Tortoise and Serpent symbolize water and fire. The Toad and Crow are the essences of moon and sun. Qian and Kun represent the pairing of heaven and earth. This one yin and one yang are called the Dao; the conjoining of sun and moon is called the Elixir. With yang alone and no yin, yang has nothing to transform. With yin alone and no yang, yin has nothing to generate. The two qi mutually sustain each other, revolving and transmuting—now separating, now uniting—endlessly wondrous in their workings. Thus, like the Cowherd and Weaver Girl’s love bound in green, this is the root of the Dao. Water-Tortoise and Fire-Serpent, *Kan* and *Li*, unite in natural affinity. Moon-Toad and Sun-Crow meet at the dark moon’s phase, their radiance enduring. Heaven-*Qian* and Earth-*Kun* embrace and uphold all with vastness, their marvelous workings divine. Man, standing as one of the Three Powers alongside heaven and earth, likewise relies on the pairing of yin and yang to complete the Dao—termed the Mysterious Female, Lead and Mercury, Dragon and Tiger, Crow and Hare, Metal and Wood, Water and Fire, Black and White, East and West, *Kan* and *Li*, Husband and Wife. The names are innumerable, yet all embody the principle of yin and yang’s mutual resonance. Should yin remain solely yin and yang solely yang, sundered and uncommunicating, fault arises and life is cut short. How then can one emerge from death and enter life, enduring as long as heaven and earth?

**Moon Over the West River**

*"Within the male lies hidden feminine essence,
Bearing yin yet embracing yang’s essence.
When the two harmonize, the medicine is complete—
Transmuting soul and spirit, sacred and numinous.

Trust in the single grain of Golden Elixir:
The serpent swallows it and at once becomes a dragon.
The fowl feeds on it and transforms into a phoenix—
All enter the true realm of pure yang."*

The one yin and one yang are called the Dao; the union of sun and moon is called the Elixir. Yet the sun, yang and fire, contains within it the moon’s crow—masculine with feminine concealed. The moon, yin and water, bears within it the sun’s hare—carrying yin yet embracing yang. For the crow pertains to *geng* and *xin* Metal, the hare to *jia* and *yi* Wood. Let no barrier divide them, and the sun’s *hun* and moon’s *po* will harmonize in one place, becoming supremely numinous and sacred. The Mysterious Pearl takes form, and the Golden Elixir is completed in an instant. The external medicine follows the same principle: yin and yang pair and transmute into the Elixir. Serpent and fowl, upon ingesting it, likewise transform into dragon and phoenix—how much more so for man, how much more for attaining the Dao? Both inner and outer elixirs take yang essence as their foundation. Regardless of whether man or beast, if one can refine yin with yang, unifying soul, spirit, sacred and numinous, then a single grain of Golden Elixir—swallowed by the serpent, it becomes a dragon; fed to the fowl, it becomes a phoenix; taken by man, he ascends as an immortal—all enter the true realm of pure yang.

Without discerning the Five Phases and Four Images,
how can one distinguish cinnabar-mercury from lead-silver?
Unversed in the art of fire-timing and withdrawal-addition,
one prematurely styles oneself a recluse.

Failing to reflect on one’s own errors,
one further teaches these mistaken paths to others,
leading them astray for generations in the maze of delusion—
how can such negligence bear the weight of conscience?

The Five Phases are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.
The Four Images are Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior.
Cinnabar-mercury is mercury drawn from cinnabar.
Lead-silver is silver drawn from lead.
Fire-timing refers to the fire of true yang and the seasonal tokens of its rhythm.

Master Pingshu admonished that scholars recklessly misidentify:
the lungs as Metal, the liver as Wood, the kidneys as Water,
the heart as Fire, and the spleen as Earth.
They further assign the liver to the Green Dragon, the lungs to the White Tiger,
the heart to the Vermilion Bird, and the kidneys to the Dark Warrior.
Such conflations of the Five Phases and Four Images
render the refinement of the Golden Elixir utterly indiscriminate,
unable to distinguish cinnabar-mercury from lead-silver.
Nor are these Five Phases and Four Images to be sought outside the body—
for lead and cinnabar are tangible substances,
just as the five viscera possess tangible forms.
How then can they serve as the foundation for attaining the Dao?

Only by discerning the intangible function within tangible form
does one progress from the coarse to the refined,
transcending the mundane to enter the sacred,
thereby grasping the secret of lead and mercury.
Yet even if one recognizes cinnabar and black lead,
ignorance of fire-timing renders such knowledge idle.
How much worse to lack understanding entirely,
yet mislead others with false instruction—
a case of the blind leading the blind,
with no hope of escape.
Can such a heart endure its own indifference?

Heaven and Earth alternate between closure and openness;
dawn and dusk must recognize the cycles of inception and obscurity.
Like spokes converging at the hub, like rivers flowing to the sea—
the marvel lies in the art of withdrawal and addition.

Attain the One, and ten thousand affairs are complete;
cease dividing east from west, south from north.
Reduce and refine with utmost care, guarding prior merit—
the Treasure of Life must not be trifled with.

When Heaven and Earth unite, it is called *Peace* (泰),
where upper yin meets lower yang.
When they fail to unite, it is called *Stagnation* (否),
where upper yang meets lower yin.
*Cloud and Thunder* (屯) signifies the inception of difficulty,
as the noble one weaves the warp and weft of creation—
things in their nascent struggle must not be harmed.
*Youthful Folly* (蒙) depicts a spring emerging from the mountain’s base,
as the noble one nurtures virtue through resolute action—
the spring’s first flow must be guided with innocence to cultivate integrity.

These four hexagrams’ meanings,
when applied as metaphors for the Golden Elixir,
are perfectly apt.
Yet some divide the sixty-four hexagrams into thirty days,
designating *Heaven* (乾), *Earth* (坤), *Water* (坎), and *Fire* (離) as the furnace and crucible—
how forced and contrived!

They fail to grasp that the Dao consists of the interplay of yin and yang,
while the work lies in the alternations of *Stagnation* (否), *Peace* (泰), *Inception* (屯), and *Folly* (蒙).
In the language of the Golden Elixir,
all depends on the essence of yin-yang union.
If Heaven remains Heaven and Earth remains Earth,
*Stagnation* persists, unyielding—
how then can they unite as *Peace*?
Without such union, how can yin and yang embody the Dao?
How can the Great Medicine become the Elixir?

As for morning as *Inception* (屯) and evening as *Folly* (蒙),
this signifies vigilance in preservation—
ever mindful of the difficulty of inception and the nurturing of innocence,
never allowing a single stray thought or moment of indulgence.
Vigilant where unseen, fearful where unheard,
one remains unwavering in the fleeting moments of dawn and dusk.
Through such cultivation,
spokes converge at the hub like a chariot in motion, flawless and unbroken,
like water flowing in its course, turning myriad bends yet ever eastward.
Thus the mechanism of the primordial qi of True Unity
resonates in perfect accord with the celestial rhythm,
withdrawal and addition harmonizing the workings of Heaven’s design.

Having attained this Treasure of Life,
one must uphold its fullness and preserve its achievement.
As *Baopuzi* states:
“If a person can guard the One, the One will guard the person.
If a person cannot guard the One, the One will depart.”
Is this not why the Treasure of Life must not be trifled with?

At the Winter Solstice, the yang returns in *Recovery* (復);
every thirty days, a yang line is added.
In the moon’s cycle, *Recovery* (復) appears at dawn on the new moon,
while at full moon, *Heaven* (乾) culminates before yielding to *Encounter* (姤).
The sun, too, marks the turning of cold and heat—
yang revives at midnight, while at noon,
the image of conception heralds the advent of yin.
Only in the alchemy of the Elixir does one discern the mysteries of dawn and dusk.

A year comprises three hundred and sixty days,
with six yin and six yang lines waxing and waning,
clustered within the hexagrams’ configurations.
There is the Winter Solstice of the year,
the Winter Solstice of the month,
and the Winter Solstice of the day.
Six positions intermingle, a single yang stirring amidst them—
the twelve hexagrams complete,
and the celestial Dao becomes luminous,
the fire-timing of the celestial cycle fulfilled.

In the year’s cycle, yang revives at the *zi* hour of the Winter Solstice,
the eleventh month governed by *Earth-Thunder Recovery* (地雷復),
marked by one yang line.
The twelfth month, governed by the *chou* branch,
is ruled by *Earth-Marsh Approach* (地澤臨),
with two yang lines.
The first month, governed by the *yin* branch,
is ruled by *Earth-Heaven Peace* (地天泰),
with three yang lines.
Each month, a hexagram shifts every thirty days,
advancing the fire-token—
thus every thirty days, a yang line is added,
completing the annual cycle of hexagrammatic qi.

To cluster the year’s months into the Winter Solstice of the month:
a month has thirty days, each day twelve hours,
totaling three hundred and sixty hours—
equivalent to a year’s three hundred and sixty days.
The first day corresponds to *Recovery* (復),
every two and a half days to *Water* (坎),
until the fifteenth day, when *Heaven* (乾) appears as pure yang.
Yet when yang reaches its zenith, yin arises—
on the sixteenth day, the full moon,
governed by *Heaven-Wind Encounter* (天風姤),
the fire-token retreats as yin grows and yang wanes.
This is what is meant by “at full moon, *Heaven* (乾) culminates before yielding to *Encounter* (姤)”—
the daily hexagrams of the month mirror the annual celestial cycle.

As for clustering the year’s days into the Winter Solstice of the day:
a day’s twelve hours divide into the nodes of yin-yang ascent and descent.
The initial *zi* hour marks the Winter Solstice, when yang revives;
the *wu* hour marks the Summer Solstice, when yin revives.
Each two-hour period corresponds to a hexagram,
with *Recovery* (復) and *Encounter* (姤) marking the inception of yin-yang advance and retreat,
and *Heaven* (乾) and *Earth* (坤) marking their transformation.
Day and night revolve within the hundred *ke*,
the workings of spirit transposed from days to hours—
likewise mirroring the annual cycle of hexagrammatic qi.

Those who cultivate the Dao set up gnomons and clepsydras externally to measure the celestial movements of the sun’s shadow, while internally they refine the True One to verify the clepsydra’s flow within their own bodies. Having grasped the Winter and Summer Solstices of the year in this way, they likewise comprehend the two solstices of the month and the two solstices of the day. Embracing the patterns of Heaven and emulating its images, they penetrate the mysteries of dusk and dawn, their spirits clear and their qi fresh, their hundred vessels harmonious and unobstructed. Though they may not yet ascend and soar to the heavens, how can this not surpass those who, lost in dissipation and lust, dwell as neighbors to ghosts?

This is to unite one’s virtue with Heaven and Earth, to merge one’s radiance with the sun and moon, to align with the sequence of the four seasons, and to harmonize with the auspices and omens of spirits and gods—how could this be heretical or distorted learning?

*To the tune of* West River Moon:
Virtue cultivated surpasses eight hundred,
Hidden merits accumulated fill three thousand.
Equalizing self and others, friend and foe,
Only then does one fulfill the original vow of immortals.

Tigers, rhinos, blades, and weapons cannot harm,
The inescapable fire-house of impermanence cannot entangle.
After the treasure talisman descends, one ascends to pay homage to Heaven,
Steadily riding the phoenix-drawn chariot of the luan-bird.

Heaven attains the One and becomes clear,
Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil,
Humankind attains the One and becomes numinous.
Our Confucian Way is threaded through by the One,
The Buddha’s teaching is that the One Mind is Buddha,
The Daoist method is that the True One abides forever.

Now, why does Master Ping Shu speak of the disparity between eight hundred and three thousand? Alas, the essence of the Dao is one, yet its manifestations differ. Spanning ancient and modern, pervading Heaven and Earth, encompassing the myriad existences, exhausting the complexities of images and numbers—the Dao is present wherever one turns. Only those who cultivate the Dao fully comprehend it in their hearts and embody it in their conduct. Whether it be the Four Beginnings and ten thousand virtues all perfected, or the Six Perfections and ten thousand practices jointly cultivated, hidden merits and manifest virtues truly accumulated through long effort, equalizing self and others, friend and foe with impartial benevolence—only then does one fulfill the original vow of immortals.

As the ancient saying goes: “To cultivate the Dao of immortality, first fulfill the Dao of humanity.” Extending this mind onward, calamities naturally dissipate, and tigers, rhinos, blades, and weapons cannot harm. One leaps free from the world’s net of impermanence, and the fire-house cannot entangle. Aligning with the will of Heaven, the Great One bestows a summons. Like Master Zhang who ascended in broad daylight, or Master Xu who rose to the heavens, all received the Heaven-sent treasure talisman, the imperial edict to return to the Golden Gates, steadily riding the luan-carriage and phoenix-pennant to the Purple Palace. Such is the fruition of cultivating the Dao and upholding the Way—the season when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name is achieved. Those with aspiration, can you not strive onward?
