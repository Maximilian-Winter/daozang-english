# 黄帝阴符经讲义

**Title:** *The Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing Commentary*
**Author:** *The Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing Commentary* was composed by **Xia Yuan Ding** (style name **Zongyu**) of the Southern Song Dynasty, completed in the third year of **Baoqing** (1227). The original text consists of three volumes, with an additional volume of diagrams and explanations. The source of this edition is the *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon of the Ming Dynasty), under the **Dongzhen** (Vital Essences) section, **Yujue** (Jade Precepts) category.

**Preface to *The Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing Commentary***
Composed by **Lou Pian**, a **Chǎoshàn Láng** (morning-dispatched officer) temporarily dispatched to govern **Xīnghuà Military Prefecture**.

In his *Records of the Arts and Literature of the Han*, **Ban Gu** (Mengjian) categorized military writings into four types: those that speak of **strategy** (*quánmóu*), those that speak of **terrain and formations** (*xíngshì*), those that speak of **yin-yang principles**, and those that speak of **tactics and skill** (*jìqiáo*). Though he divided them into distinct schools—each specializing in one aspect—yet their underlying essence remains interconnected. Mengjian stated:

*"Strategists maintain the nation with righteousness and employ unconventional means in warfare, encompassing terrain and formations while mastering yin-yang principles, and applying tactics and skill."*

Thus, these four schools are fundamentally one.

However, Mengjian grouped **terrain, yin-yang, and skill** under **strategy**, whereas I instead unite **strategy, terrain, and skill** under **yin-yang**, for between heaven and earth, there exists only **one yin and one yang**. Strategy involves **expansion and contraction** (*zòngbì*), terrain involves **separation and union** (*líhé*), and skill involves **convergence and divergence** (*xīzhāng*). Yet the very means by which these expansions, contractions, separations, unions, convergences, and divergences occur are the **transformations of yin and yang**. Therefore, it is said: *"One yin and one yang constitute the Dao/Way."*

When **Fan Li** plotted for the state of **Wu**, he mastered the timing of **victory and defeat, early and late action** (*yíngsuō zǎoyàn zhìjié*), and extended his reasoning to the **barrenness of rice and crabs** (*dào xiè zhī wúzhǒng*). Yet with a single charge, he captured the enemy—first employing this strategy against another nation, then later using the same principle to secure his own family’s prosperity. This is what is meant by *"later generations build on the foundations of their ancestors."* Those who move with the times like ferocious beasts or raptors—is this not the application of **yin-yang principles**? And yet, **strategy, terrain, and skill** are inherently at work within them.

Truly, ancient military masters who excelled in warfare never failed to grasp **yin-yang principles**. **Feng Hu** (the mythical sage of the Five Emperors) held unconventional strategies, **Wu Hou** (Zhuge Liang) deployed the **Eight Battle Arrays**, and **Li Weigong** (Li E) mastered the **lonely void and crow omens**—these were merely their outward expressions. But there are those who went even further: **Zhang Liang** (Leavehu) knelt in submission at **Qiuyuan Bridge**, receiving teachings from an old man, while **Su Qin** (Changong) dismissed such claims, saying, *"How do you know that the age of Qin lacks hidden virtuous men?"* I would add: *"How do you know that the age of Qin lacks Daoist immortals?"* Perhaps **Zhang Liang** merely encountered a **true master** (*zhìrén*) by chance.

*The Yinshu Jing* is a work attributed to the **Yellow Emperor**, its language ancient, profound, and abstruse—so much so that readers struggle to parse even its sentences, let alone annotate it. **Xia Jun** (Zongyu) came from **Zhejiang to Fujian**, presenting me with a single manuscript, which was his commentary.

Xia Jun, in his youth, studied under the **forebears of Yongjia** (*Yǒngjiā zhūdàolǎo*), yet uniquely took delight in examining this text alone—though he did not fully comprehend it. Later, while in **Shangrao**, he prayed in secret:

*"Before ascending the **Dragon-Tiger List** (of fame),
I shall first ascend **Dragon-Tiger Mountain** (of cultivation)."*

That night, he experienced a strange dream, and afterward, he encountered a **true master** (*zhìrén*) at the summit of **Zhūfú Peak**, as if receiving divine instruction. He then took up this book again, dissecting its chapters and parsing its sentences, and with a stroke of his pen, the commentary was completed—almost as if a **mysterious force** (*shénwù*) from the unseen had aided him.

This was no mere imitation or conjecture, like the shallow annotations and commentaries of the world! There must have been an **intuitive resonance** (*yóurán zìdé yǔ mòqì*)—a deep, unspoken understanding.

Though **warfare and immortality** (*shénxiān*) may seem distinct, they are not easily separated. To speak of warfare is to descend into **deception and cunning** (*guìjué biànzhà*), while to speak of immortality is to drift into **vague mysticism and empty rhetoric** (*huǎnghuò dànmàn*). Yet immortality is not something sought from without! **Clarity and virtue** (*qīngmíng*) reside within oneself—when **resolve and qi** (*zhìqì*) are as refined as the divine, then **immortality and warfare are one**.

To master **immortality is to know warfare**; to master **warfare is to know immortality**. **Zhǒng Míng** (a legendary figure) spent his life in seclusion on **Mount Hua**, yet his descendants became renowned generals. **Yáo Píngzhòng** (a historical figure) suffered a minor setback in the capital, and some assumed he had fled to avoid death. But the **immortality** of which our **Confucian scholars** speak is not of that sort—it lies here, within the self, not there, in the external.

Those who read Xia Jun’s commentary should bear this in mind.

**Composed in autumn, the eighth month of the second year of Baoqing (1226), by Lou Pian, with reverence.**

**Volume One of *The Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing Commentary***
Composed by **Xia Yuan Ding**, style name **Zongyu**, of the **Yúnfēng School**.

**The Text Says:**
*"To observe the Dao of heaven, to grasp heaven’s actions—this is complete.
Heaven’s command is called **nature** (*xìng*), and to follow one’s nature is called the Dao/Way.
The Dao is not something that can be sought above the **dim void** (*míngmò*).
The Dao of heaven resides within my own self—
If I can exhaust its mysteries through observation,
Then my eyes shall strike upon the Dao’s presence,
And the **Supreme Dao** shall not be elaborate.

It is essential to grasp heaven’s actions,
Never letting go for even a moment within the **twelve cycles** (*shíèrshí*).
Every word spoken, every silent pause,
Every breath in, every breath out—
**Yin opens**, **yang closes** (*yīnkāi yángbì*),
The sun sets in the west, the sun rises in the east,
Winds and clouds vent through the **seven orifices** (*qīqiào*),
**Kàn and Lí** (water and fire) intermingle at the **primordial palace** (*yuángōng*).
Heaven operates through this Dao, moving across the **ten thousand transformations** (*wànhuà*).
I, too, operate through this Dao, enacting its principles within my own form.
Cold and heat align with its rhythms,
The sun and moon harmonize in its cycles,
The **Vitality of Heaven** (*qiánjiàn*) sustains through it without end,
And its application in daily life is boundless and natural.

I do not know that I am heaven,
Nor that heaven is I.
This is what is meant by:
*'My fate lies within me, not in heaven'—
Is this not the case?"*

*"This is said to be complete—
Nothing further can be added.
Heaven has **five thieves** (*wǔzéi*), those who see them prosper.
The **five thieves** are the **Five Phases** (*wǔxíng*).

Humans inherit the **Five Phases** from heaven,
And within humans, the **Five Phases** are the **five thieves**.
Is this not heaven’s transformation?
No, it is not.
When the **Five Phases** are disordered, the **Great Dao** (*Dàdào*) emerges.
If one aligns with them, one becomes a **complete person** (*chéngrén*).
If one opposes them, one applies **elixir refinement** (*dān yòng*).
Just as **metal and wood** must **intermingle and unite** (*jiāobìng*),
And **water and fire** must **achieve completion** (*jìjì*),
When **earth** flourishes across the four seasons,
It returns to its function of **overcoming water** (*kèshuǐ*).
This is how the **Five Phases** become **thieves** of one another.

The **profound mysteries** (*xuānyī*) of the Dao—
How can the common world perceive this truth?
Thus, those who see it prosper,
For **sincerity** (*chéng*) brings **clarity** (*míng*), and **clarity** brings **manifestation** (*zhuó*)."*

「The empty chamber yields white—
A marvel of luminous brilliance when filled with substance.
Though it speaks of **observing the Dao of Heaven** (*guāntiān zhī dào*),
And again of **seeing Heaven’s prosperity** (*jiàn tiān zhī chāng*),
The sage reveals the **Great Dao** (*Dàdào*) to all,
Yet the dim-witted pass by though it stands before them.
Alas.

The **Five Thieves** (*wǔ zéi*) dwell within the heart,
Manifesting in the **Heavenly operations** (*shīxíng yú tiān*).
The **Five Phases** and the **Five Thieves**—
Their principles are profound and subtle.
The heart is **Heaven’s sovereign** (*tiān jūn*), truly capable of **mastery** (*zhǔzǎi*).

This **manifestation in Heaven** (*shīxíng yú tiān*)
All arises from the **functions of my heart** (*jiē zài wú xīn zhī yòng*).
Indeed, the heart is Heaven,
And Heaven is the heart.
If one attains the **Heaven of a single mind** (*yī xīn zhī tiān*),
And **steals the marvels of creation** (*qiè zào huà zhī miào*),
Then in **ascending and descending, motion and stillness** (*dòngjìng zhìjiàng*),
They stand beside the **Emperor** (*dì*) as His deputy,
Yet at the moment of **manifestation** (*shīxíng*),
One does not know which is Heaven,
Which is the heart.

The **cosmos** (*yǔzhòu*) lies within the **hand** (*shǒu*).
The hand is the **vital nexus** (*yào*) of the **Three Passes** (*sān guān*).
Those who study the **Dao** (*dào*) must know what to begin with.

The *Huángtíng Jīng* states:
*"The mouth is the **heart’s pass** (*xīn guān*), where **spirit** (*shén*) and **vitality** (*qì*)**meet** (*jī*).
The feet are the **life’s pass** (*mìng guān*), the **gate of the natal earth** (*shēngdì fēi*).
The hands are the **human pass** (*rén guān*), holding **prosperity and decline** (*bǎ shèngkuī*)."*

What is not within the hand?
One can **grasp the Heavenly symbols and cardinal directions** (*àn tiānxiàng fāngyú*),
**Calculate the Five Movements and Six Qi** (*tuī wǔ yùn liù qì*),
**Clutch and nurture harmony** (*wò gù yǐ yǎng hé*),
**Flicker fingers to govern transformations** (*tán zhǐ yǐ shè huà*),
**Diagnose to discern the signs of yin and yang** (*zhěn shì yǐ zhī yīn yáng zhī hòu*),
**Fix the gaze to commune with spirits** (*jué mù yǐ tōng guǐshén zhī líng*).
Not a single function exists outside the hand.

The **cosmos and six directions** (*yǔzhòu liù hé*)
Are vast beyond measure.
If one attains the **profound mysteries** (*huáng miào*),
Is it not as though they are **displayed upon the palm** (*shì zhū zhǎng hū*)?

The *Shēngtóng Xù* says:
*"The **Heavenly Pass** (*Tiān guān*) lies in the palm—
This is the **yin-symbol** (*yīn fú*) of the **sixty-four transformations** (*liùshísì guà*)."*

All **transformations** (*wàn huà*) are born from the **body** (*shēn*).
A single human body,
A **Heaven and Earth** (*yī tiān dì*).
There are **ascensions and descents of yin and yang** (*yīn yáng shēngjiàng*),
**Ebbs and flows of the tortoise and hare** (*wū tù chūmò*),
**Tides of fortune** (*cháo hòu wǎnglái*),
**Winds and rains, clarity and obscurity** (*fēng yǔ mínghuì*),
**Thunders and lightnings crashing** (*léi diàn hōngshǎn*),
**Clouds exhaling and inhaling** (*yún qì tútūn*),
**Mountains and rivers in their fixed positions** (*shān hé liúzhì*).
In **motion and stillness, speech and silence, opening and closing, transformations** (*dòngjìng yǔyù mòyǔ hébì biànhuà*),
Not a single aspect fails to mirror **Heaven**.
Truly, all **transformations** arise from here.

Yet, those who **possess the Dao** (*yǒu dào zhě*) give birth to **transformations** (*wàn huà*),
While those without the Dao **extinguish them** (*wú dào zhě*).
The living **consort with Heaven** (*yǔ tiān wéi tú*),
While the dead **neighbor with spirits** (*yǔ guǐ wéi lín*).

How can one not **cherish oneself** (*zì ài*)?

**Heaven’s nature** (*Tiān xìng*) is **humanity** (*rén*).
The **human heart** (*rén xīn*) is the **mechanism** (*jī*).
**Establishing Heaven’s Dao** (*lì tiān zhī dào*) is to **settle humanity** (*yǐ dìng rén*).

**Heaven and humanity share a single mind** (*tiān rén yī xīn*),
And **mechanism and Dao move in unison** (*jī dào tóng zhé*).
From the **six desires and seven emotions** (*liù yù qī qíng*),
They can **plunder the true essence** (*suǒ yǐ duó qí xìngzhēn*),
Then the **fire of karma and cognition** (*yè shí huǒ*) blazes forth,
And one does not know which is Heaven,
Which is humanity,
Which is the **mechanism** (*jī*),
Which is the **Dao** (*dào*).

The **Supreme Sage** (*shàngshèng*), vast in compassion (*hóng cí*),
Exposes the **profound truths** (*zhǎn míng ào zhǐ*),
Saying that **essence is Heaven** (*xìng jí tiān*) and **Heaven is humanity** (*tiān jí rén*)
—these ultimate principles are **indivisibly fused** (*zhìlǐ húnróng*).
They cannot be **separated or questioned** (*bùkě zhì jué*).
If one **seizes the mechanism** (*bì dé qí jī*) and **responds to it** (*yìng zhī*),
Then **naturally** (*zìrán*) they **align** (*wén hé*).

Is this the **worldly cunning and deceit** (*shì jī qiǎo biàn zhà*) of mortals?
No, it is not.
It is the **mechanism’s latent operation** (*jī jiān zhī yùn*),
Swift yet unhurried (*bùjí ér sù*),
The **mechanism’s responses** (*jī guān zhī yìng*),
As though **seals were joined** (*ruò hé fú jié*).

If one **discerns this mechanism** (*míng zhì jī*),
Then the **heart unites with creation** (*xīn tóng zào huà*),
And the **mechanism’s responses** (*jī yìng*) never fail—
Then **Heaven’s Dao is established** (*tiān dào lì*),
And **humanity’s Dao is settled** (*rén dào dìng*).

It is not as though one **discards humanity’s Dao** (*shě rén dào*)
And **separately establishes Heaven’s Dao** (*bié lì tiān dào*),
Nor that one **first establishes Heaven’s Dao** (*xiān lì tiān dào*)
And **then settles humanity’s Dao** (*hòu dìng rén dào*).

For **humanity’s Dao is Heaven’s Dao** (*rén dào jí tiān dào*),
And **Heaven’s Dao is Heaven’s mechanism** (*tiān dào jí tiān jī*),
And **Heaven’s mechanism is Heaven’s nature** (*tiān jī jí tiān xìng*).
Thus, **"preserving the heart, nourishing the nature"** (*cún qí xīn, yǎng qí xìng*)
Is how one **serves Heaven** (*suǒ yǐ shì tiān*).

When **Heaven’s killing mechanism** (*tiān fā shā jī*) is unleashed,
**Dragons and serpents** (*lóng shé*) **emerge onto land** (*qǐ lù*).
When **Earth’s killing mechanism** (*dì fā shā jī*) is unleashed,
**Stars and constellations** (*xīng chén*) **fall and are subdued** (*yǔn fú*).
When **humanity’s killing mechanism** (*rén fā shā jī*) is unleashed,
**Heaven and Earth reverse** (*tiān dì fǎn fù*).
When **Heaven and humanity’s mechanisms are joined** (*tiān rén hé fā*),
The **foundations of all transformations** (*wàn huà dìng jī*) are set.

The **Three Powers** (*sān cái*) occupy distinct positions,
Yet **life and death share the same mechanism** (*shēngsǐ tóng jī*).

Yet the **killing mechanism** (*shā jī*)
Is the **means by which life is generated** (*suǒ yǐ shēng zhī*),
And **life itself** (*shēng zhě*)
Is the **means by which killing is enacted** (*suǒ yǐ shā zhī*).

Moreover, when **yin doubts the yang** (*yīn yí yú yáng*),
They must **engage in battle** (*bì zhàn*),
And their **blood turns black and yellow** (*qí xuè huáng huáng*),
This is where the **killing mechanism** (*shā jī*) **resides** (*qù*).

What then of the **three yangs in harmonious union** (*sān yáng jiāo tài*)?
All **myriad things** (*wàn huì*) **prosper** (*xián héng*).
When **Heaven’s killing mechanism** (*tiān fā shā jī*) is unleashed,
It **clears below** (*xià chú yīn xié zhī qì*),
Then **thunders crash and lightnings sweep** (*léi hōng diàn sǎo*),
And **Heaven’s awe** (*tiān wēi*) **shines forth** (*hèrán*).
**Dragons and serpents** (*lóng shé*) **retreat into concealment** (*diàn zàng*),
Unable to avoid rising,
Emerging in the **epoch of yang’s dominance** (*lù yú yáng shèng zhī shí*).

When **Earth’s killing mechanism** (*dì fā shā jī*) is unleashed,
It **receives above** (*shàng chéng chǎng gāng zhī yùn*),
Then **the Spring Gushing Well surges with waves** (*yǒng quán qǐ làng*),
And **the Yellow River flows in reverse** (*huáng hé nì liú*),
**The Big Dipper’s handle shifts** (*běi dòu shǒu zhì*),
Unable to avoid **rotation** (*bùróng bùxuán*),
**Subdued in the moment when yin and yang vie in victory** (*fú yú yīn yáng jiāo shèng zhī jì*).

If **humanity discerns this mechanism** (*rén shí zhì jī*),
Then they **plunder creation in secret** (*qián duó zào huà*),
**Turn the heavens and invert the earth** (*xuán qián zhuǎn kūn*),
**Flip Heaven and reverse Earth** (*fǎn tiān fù dì*),
Causing **Earth and Heaven to exchange** (*shǐ dì tiān jiāo wéi tài*),
And **life and death to settle** (*shēngsǐ dìng wéi gōng*).

The **True Person of Great White** (*Tài Bái zhēn rén*) sings:
*"The **Five Phases in disorder** (*wǔ xíng diān dào*)—
**Dragons rise from fire** (*lóng cóng huǒ lǐ chū*).
When the **Five Phases do not flow in harmony** (*wǔ xíng bù shùn xíng*),
**Tigers are born from water** (*hǔ xiàng shuǐ zhōng shēng*).
This is the **mechanism of reversal** (*fǎn fù zhī jī*)."*

Although, **Heaven, Earth, and humanity** (*tiān dì rén*) are listed as the **Three Powers** (*sān cái*),
**Life and death, mechanism** (*shēngsǐ jī*) all stem from **one breath** (*yī qì*).

Mencius said:
*"I excel in **nurturing my vast and unyielding qi** (*hàorán zhī qì*),
Filling the **space between Heaven and Earth** (*chōng sè hū tiān dì zhī jiān*).
Is it not as though I **discard my body alone** (*yě qǐ shě wú shēn zhī wài*)
And **separately seek another Heaven and Earth** (*bié yǒu tiān dì kě chōng sè*) to fill?"

Thus, one knows that the **operation of one breath** (*yī qì zhī yùn*)
Is not that **Heaven has excess** (*yǐ zài tiān zhě yǒu yú*)
And **humanity lacks** (*ér zài rén zhě bù zú*).
When **Heaven and humanity’s mechanisms are joined** (*tiān rén hé fā*),
Not a **hair’s breadth** (*bù chà háo lí*) is amiss.
The **mechanism’s seals are hidden yet responsive** (*jī jiān mò yìng*),
Transforming in **ten thousand ways** (*biàn huà wàn duān*).
The **foundation of elixir** (*dān jī*) is **fixed** (*dìng*),
And the **Great Dao** (*Dàdào*) **thrives** (*zīshēng*).

**Nature** (*xìng*) has **cleverness and clumsiness** (*qiǎo zhuō*).
It can be **concealed and hidden** (*fú cáng*).
**Form and appearance** (*xíng sè*) are **Heaven’s nature** (*tiān xìng*),
Yet **skills and cunning** (*jì qiǎo*) arise from here.
**Concealment and hiding** (*fú cáng*) are **awaiting the moment** (*dài shí*),
Yet **Heaven’s mechanism** (*tiān jī*) **resides within** (*qù yán*).
If one has this **nature** (*xìng*), then one has this **mechanism** (*jī*),
Not that one **forever conceals and hides** (*wéi zhōng yú fú cáng*)
And **never applies the heart** (*ér wú suǒ yòng xīn*).

**"Cherishing talent and nourishing vast clarity"** (*huái cái yǎng hào míng shí*)
Is the **true essence of elixir refinement** (*zhèng jīn dān zhī mì zhǐ*).

Some say:
*"Yin lead (主伏) and yang mercury (主飞) are **concealed and ascendant** (*fú fēi*).
The sage **conceals yang mercury** (*fú yáng gǒng*)
To **refine yin lead** (*liàn yīn yǎn*).
Thus, **great cleverness appears as clumsiness** (*dà qiǎo ruò zhuō*)."*
No, this is incorrect.

Rather, **the Yellow Emperor** (*huángdì*) **exclusively spoke of cleverness and clumsiness** (*zhuān yán qiǎo zhuō zhě zài xìng*),
**Concealment and hiding** (*fú cáng*) as **awaiting the moment** (*dài shí*).
For **nature** (*xìng*) **harmonizes with the Mysterious Origin** (*hé yú xuán yuán*),
Yet **lead and mercury** (*yǎn gǒng*) are **constrained by form and substance** (*jū yú xíng zhì*).

If this **nature** (*xìng*) is **spiritually luminous** (*líng míng*),
And the **yang spirit** (*yáng hún*) **daily thrives** (*rì shèng*),
Then **cleverness and clumsiness** (*qiǎo zhuō*) **cannot obscure** (*mò*).
**Concealment and hiding** (*fú cáng*) **await the moment** (*dài shí*),
And when **Heaven’s mechanism responds** (*tiān jī yī yìng*),
Then **Heaven’s nature is revealed** (*tiān xìng jiàn*).

This is precisely **Zhongli Quan’s** teaching that **sevenfold return of the elixir** (*qī fǎn huán dān*) requires first **refining oneself and awaiting the moment** (*liàn jǐ dài shí*).

To grasp the principle of **awaiting the moment** (*dài shí*) is to understand the **nature of concealment and cleverness/clumsiness** (*fú cáng qiǎo zhuō*).

The **nine orifices’ depravity** (*jiǔ qiào zhī xié*) lies in the **three essentials** (*sān yào*), which govern **movement and stillness** (*dòng jìng*). The **human body’s nine orifices**—seven above, two below—are nothing but **filth and defilement**. Those who **pursue the Dao** must examine these closely, **restraining the three essentials** (*shè sān yào*), only then will **movement and stillness** be free of **depraved intent**.

What are these **three essentials**? They are **ears, eyes, and mouth**.

*The Parametric Concordance* (*Cāntóng Qì*) states:
*"The three treasures must be sealed—do not let them disperse."*

Since these three are **critical pivots**, their **movement and stillness** are unending. If a **diligent practitioner** (*qióng rén*) carefully attends to these three essentials, then:
- **All sounds of the world**, in their myriad transformations, are **subdued by Kān**—his **hearing** (*cōng*) is not **seized by them**.
- **All colors of the world**, in their myriad transformations, are **subdued by Lǐ**—his **vision** (*míng*) is not **obscured by them**.
- **All flavors of the world**, in their myriad transformations, are **subdued by Duì**—his **ingestion** (*nà*) is not **disrupted by them**.

Thus, **natural clarity and luminosity** (*qīng míng*) abide within him, his **intent and qi** (*zhì qì*) as refined as **spirit** (*shén*). Between **movement and stillness**, he follows **Heaven’s natural order** (*tiān lǐ zhī zhèng*)—though **ten thousand depravities** arise, none can **assail him**.

The **nine orifices’ depravity**—what harm can they do to me?
This is the very principle of:
*"What is not proper, do not look upon;
What is not proper, do not listen to;
What is not proper, do not speak of."*
How could this be **heterodox**?

Fire **arises from wood**—when **calamity strikes**, it **conquers**.
**Deceit arises within the state**—when **opportunity moves**, it **collapses**.

To **know this** and **refine it** is to be **sage**.
Wood **can generate fire**, yet **ultimately burns itself**.
A **state that breeds deceit** **ultimately invites chaos**.
This is the **inevitable fate** of such **afflictions**.

Those who **pursue the Dao** must **know this**, so that **fire arises from wood yet wood does not burn**, **deceit arises in the state yet the state does not fall**—just as **eating, drinking, and procreation** are **fundamental desires** of humanity, which **cannot be utterly rejected** for their **depraved potential**.

If one **indulges these desires**, then **what will not be done**?
Only by **Dao** can they be **regulated**, so that **fire and wood nourish each other**, turning **calamity into blessing**, and though **deceit arises**, it becomes **uprightness**—is this not the **sage’s refined practice**?

This is the **principle of dwelling in filth yet remaining unstained, emerging from death into life**.

Yet among the **Five Phases**, **wood and fire** are the most **prolific in generation**. In the **human body**, the **Five Phases** regard **wood and fire** as **flourishing or declining**—if the **true essence** (*zhēn yuán*) is **not depleted**, then **wood and fire blaze forth**.

**Responding subtly to Heaven’s mechanism** (*miàn yìng tiān jī*), the **common man** harms himself by **indulging them**, thus **recklessly squandering life and fostering deceit**.
The **sage refines them to attain the Dao**, thus **restoring to the proper order**.

If the **true essence decays and fails**, then **wood and fire are extinguished**, **Heaven’s Way is broken**, and **humanity drifts far while the ghostly realm draws near**.
Alas!

**The Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Symbol Classic* (*Huángdì Yīnfú Jīng*) Lecture Notes, Volume One, concludes.**

The **Cloud Peak** (*Yúnfēng*) Master Summer Yuan Ding, descendant of Yu, composed:

The **Sutra** says:

**"Heaven begets and Heaven slays—this is the Way’s principle.**

When **qi** responds to the **Yellow Bell** (*Huángzhōng*), all things sprout and move—this is Heaven’s begetting;
When the **Lü** (*lǜ*) aligns with **Yìzhé** (*夷则*), all things wither and gather—this is Heaven’s slaying.

Yet why does Heaven both beget and then slay?

It is because the principle of begetting and slaying lies within them.
How does one know that a man can fulfill this **Dao** within his own body?

By **secretly** (*mì*) **penetrating** (*cān*) the **mechanism of creation** (*zào huà*), one sees that spring begets and autumn slays,
That **yin-yang** (*yīn-yáng*) **transform and exchange** (*dài xiè*)—not confined to the year’s cycle,
But occurring within the twelve **times** (*shí*), **seasons** (*shí*).
Thus, one can **seize** (*duó*) **Heaven’s wondrous operation** (*miào yòng*)
And **grasp** (*dé*) **the Way’s wondrous principle** (*miào lǐ*).

**Heaven and Earth** are the **thieves** (*dào*) of all things;
All things are the **thieves** of man;
Man is the **thief** of all things.
When the **Three Thieves** (*sān dào*) **harmonize** (*róng yí*), the **Three Powers** (*sān cái*) **rest** (*ān*).
**Heaven’s Way** favors begetting, **Earth’s Way** favors growth.
Man, as the **most refined** (*líng*) of all things, all things as man’s **use** (*yòng*)—how can he be a thief?
If not, then **Heaven and Earth are unkind** (*bù rén*), treating all things as **fodder** (*chú gǒu*),
Stealing from all things while preventing their **flourishing** (*cháng róng*)—this is **Heaven and Earth stealing from all things**.

The **Five Colors** blind the eyes, the **Five Sounds** deaf the ears,
The **Five Flavors** dull the palate—this is all things stealing from man,
Preventing his **permanent prosperity** (*yǒng mào*).

When axes and adzes enter the forests, nets and traps descend into the marshes,
When the **Five Grains** and **Six Herbs** are cooked and devoured—this is man stealing from all things,
Preventing their **long life** (*cháng shēng*).

Yet though the **Three Thieves** secretly **consumed** (*xiāo shuò*) and **mutually destroyed** (*jīn sàng*) one another,
Unknowingly, their **flourishing and decay, life and death** (*róng kuī shēng sǐ*)
Cannot be **probed** (*zhì jié*).

It is not that **Heaven, Earth, and all things** are insufficient to harm,
But that man’s **harm** (*hài*) is **deep-rooted** (*shēn suǒ yǐ wéi hài*).

How can this be **clarified** (*míng*)?

**Heaven and Earth** steal from all things while **covering and nurturing** (*fù zǎi*) them **constantly** (*cháng cún*);
All things steal from man while **continuously** (*bù jué*) **forming** (*shēng chéng*);
Yet when man steals from all things, he **borrows** (*běn zī*) them **to sustain life** (*yǎng shēng*),
But **cannot** (*fǎn bù néng*) **long endure** (*cháng shēng*), thus **becoming** (*wéi*) **the victim of all things**—alas!

Can the **common man** deeply **comprehend** (*míng*) this principle?

If he can **comprehend** it, he will naturally **know** how to **refine** (*xiū*) and **guard** (*shǒu*) the **Three Treasures** (*sān bǎo*),
**Love and nurture** (*ài yǎng*) the **Soul Pearl** (*líng zhū*),
**Preserve the Three and Guard the One** (*cún sān shǒu yī*), keeping **Essence, Qi, and Spirit** (*jīng qì shén*) **complete** (*quán*).
Then the **Scarlet Elixir** (*hè chì jīn dān*) will **radiate**, its **luminous vitality** (*huī guāng chōng shí*) **full** (*quán*).
How could **Heaven, Earth, and all things** harm me?

Alas, if he **remains ignorant** (*mèi*) of this,
He will **assume** that man’s **life** (*shēng*) **between Heaven and Earth** (*tiān dì jiān*) **must rely** (*zī*) on all things,
That all things **benefit man** (*lì rén*) **must rely** (*zī*) on **Heaven and Earth**—this is **natural** (*gù yí*).
Yet if he **deems** (*yǐ wéi róng yí*) this **natural** (*yí*),
He will **settle** (*ān*) for it and **not regard** (*bù wéi yì*) it as **strange** (*yì*).

The **Sage** **lamented** this, hence saying:
*"The Three Thieves harmonize—how can this be harmonious?"*
It is because they **harm each other** (*hù xiāng qiāng dào*) **without end** (*wú yǒu zhōng jīng*).

*"The Three Powers rest—how can this be restful?"*
It is because they **comfortably occupy their ranks** (*dǐng fèn liè wèi*) while **resting in mutual theft** (*ān yú xiāng dào*).

I **deeply pity** (*shēn suǒ yǐ wéi mǐn*) the **common man’s** **failure to awaken** (*bù míng yú dào*)
And his **inability to transcend** (*bù chāo tuō*) the **surface of creation** (*zào huà biǎo*),
Thus **emerging from death into life** (*chū sǐ rù shēng*), **abandoning decay for flourishing** (*qì kuī jiù róng*),
And **aligning with Heaven, Earth, and all things** in their **final transformations** (*xiāng wéi zhōng shǐ*).

Ah! This is why the **Yellow Emperor** **perfected the Elixir** (*chéng jīn dān*) and **ascended to Heaven** (*dēng tiān*),
And why later **worthy disciples** (*hòu xián*) **also** **fled their dwellings** (*bá zhái*) and **rose upward** (*shàng shēng*) in succession.

How do the **Three Thieves** harm those who **follow the Way** (*yǒu dào*)?

Hence it is said:
*"To eat in season, all limbs are **regulated** (*lǐ*).*
A man’s **life** (*shēng*) **depends** on the **Four Great Elements** (*sì dà jià hé*), his **limbs and bones** (*zhī jié bǎi cái*), **spirit and qi** (*jīng xué xuè qì*)—
Without **nourishment** (*shí dàn*) they cannot be **fulfilled** (*chōng yǎng*).
If he **misses the season** (*shī qí shí*), not only is it **useless** (*wú yì*), but it **harms** (*fǎn hài*) him.

Moreover, the **Great Elixir Way** (*jīn dān dà dào*) **also** has **seasons** (*cǎi yǒu shí*), **days** (*qǔ yǒu rì*) for **taking** (*cǎi*).
Its **sweetness** (*gān*) is like **honey** (*yí*), its **size** (*dà*) like an **orange** (*jú*).
To **consume** (*shí*) it is to **ascend to transcendence** (*dēng xiān*), with **golden sinews and jade bones** (*jīn gēn yù gǔ*).
This is when **blood transforms into marrow** (*xué huà wéi gāo*), **marrow transforms into qi** (*gāo huà wéi qì*), **qi transforms into spirit** (*qì huà wéi shén*), **flying to the Golden Threshold** (*fēi shēng jīn què*).
How could this **stop** (*wéi zhǐ*) at merely **regulating the limbs** (*bǎi cái lǐ*)?

To **stir** (*dòng*) its **mechanism** (*jī*), all **transformations** (*wàn huà*) **rest** (*ān*).
**Heaven and Earth’s creation** (*tiān dì zào huà*) is **deeply unfathomable** (*shēn bù kě cè*);..."

The mechanism seals itself in silent operation, just as it does within the human body. If one attains this mechanism, then all movement is auspicious, and though transformations are myriad, they rest securely without peril. Should one lose it, then danger is inevitable. Where then is security?

People know their spirit as spirit, yet do not know what makes it so. Great indeed is the function of spirit! Yet it has hidden and revealed aspects, concealed and exposed—here lies the division between sage and commoner.

Ordinary folk merely deploy their skills in speech and writing, achieving without seeking, hitting without thinking, and deeming it their own spirit. Yet they know not that their karma and perceptions are in constant flux, responding to myriad changes, chasing after things and losing themselves, never a moment’s peace. Alas! The blazing flame consumes its own oil, the fragrant incense withers its root—only hastening their own exhaustion. Why? Because their brilliance is too exposed.

Only the sage turns inward, seals the senses, and contains the flow. Hidden and inscrutable, even ghosts and gods cannot fathom them. Thus, they seem vague and confused, as if without knowledge, yet within them lies substance; dim and murky, as if not spiritual, yet within them lies essence. This is not the spirit of spirit—it is the means to attain supreme spirit. Who but the Daoist can grasp this?

The sun and moon follow their courses, great and small have their fixed measures. From this arises the sage’s work, from this emerges divine clarity. The sun is the Greater Yang, the moon the Greater Yin; the sun is the fiery soul, the moon the water essence. With water and fire’s dual symbols manifest, how could Yin and Yang lack their numbers?

The heavens span three hundred sixty-five and a quarter degrees. Each degree completes in a day, while the moon traverses twelve degrees in a day and night. The sun moves slowly, thus completing a celestial circuit in a year; the moon moves swiftly, completing one in a month. Their differing speeds interact, Yin and Yang depend on each other, giving rise to great and small consummations—fixed numbers that do not alter.

Within a human body, too, there are sun and moon, degrees and cycles. Their celestial revolutions are not measured in years. Compressing years into months, months into days, within twelve hours, Yin and Yang naturally rise and fall, soul and essence generate anew. When the sage’s work is applied, the tortoise and hare unite, the dragon and tiger mate, struck by thunder and nourished by wind and rain. The empty chamber births purity, entering the realm of nonexistence, blending with the returning wind—achieved in the instant of a single meal’s preparation. This is called the emergence of divine clarity, yet one does not know that clarity arises from spirit, nor spirit from clarity.

The void within being is the deepest mystery; being within the void is the subtlest wonder. Transformations are boundless, unfathomable; illumination is transparent, unobstructed—this is called divine clarity, beyond conception.

Yet to harmonize with Heaven and Earth’s virtue, to align with the sun and moon’s luminosity—this is the Dao itself. Nowadays, people merely recite it with their mouths, never embodying it in their bodies. Instead, they dismiss the Daoist path as absurd. Alas! Their living corpses, their latrine-walking, they call it wealth, honor, joy—yet they know not the emptiness of dreams, bubbles, and shadows. How deeply pitiable!

The thief of mechanisms is unseen by the world, unknown to all. The gentleman who attains it remains steadfast in adversity; the petty man who seizes it risks his life. The metaphor of the thief is profound indeed.

What is a thief? The unseen. What is a mechanism? The uncontrollable. To carry it away under cover of night—this is theft, yet who knows it? To set the trap and wait—this is the mechanism, yet who can restrain it?

Yet this thief, this mechanism—when wielded, they harmonize the Three Powers, mastering creation’s opening and closing. Qi flows freely, the mechanism seals itself in response, and the common folk use it daily without knowing. Only the Daoist attains it to endure hardship—not that they cling to poverty, but that they reject worldly wealth, avoid rich foods, delight in emptiness, and embrace simplicity. This is the meaning of enduring adversity.

The petty man uses it to court danger—not that they seek blades or war, but that they indulge in lust, revel in music and

The day and night between, the Three Palaces invert and return, yin and yang ascend and descend, their correspondence unerring, their cycles endless—this is the marvel of response and communion.

Ah! This Dao cannot be grasped by mere observation or verified through daily use—how then could one speak of it?

Yet even so, its efficacy varies tenfold, a hundredfold—why? Because to discard perception, abandon the body, wither like dead wood and grow cold as ashes, though one may attain stillness and enter the Dao, the flaw lies in the Buddhist extreme of emptiness and quiescence, unable to transform and adapt, ultimately becoming but a tormented shade or ghost. Thus, its efficacy remains but tenfold.

But when one severs the single source of desire and yet can invert day and night threefold, naturally guarding the True One and embracing unity, ascending and descending the Three Palaces, cycling endlessly day and night without pause—when human and celestial mechanisms align, responding like the divine, beyond all comparison—this is to harmonize with Heaven and Earth in virtue, to unite with the sun and moon in luminosity. Its efficacy is unmatched—how else could it be but a hundredfold?

Long ago, Duke Huan of Lu asked Kang Changzi about the Dao of hearing and seeing. Kang Changzi replied: *"Those who transmit it falsely err. I can see and hear without relying on ears and eyes, yet I cannot replace their function. One must make the body conform to the heart, the heart to qi, qi to spirit, and spirit to the Formless. When there is the distinct presence of form and the resonant affirmation of sound—whether distant in the eight extremes or near as the eyelashes—none can escape my seeing and hearing."*

If the world knew Kang Changzi’s seeing and hearing, it would understand the Yellow Emperor’s seeing and hearing as a blind man. Profound and mysterious!

The heart arises from things, dies from things—its mechanism lies in the eyes. The heart and eyes are interdependent, life and death mutually conditioned, things and mechanisms responding without interruption.

Humans are the most refined of all things, daily interacting with the myriad creatures. A thought arises, and with it, things generate from the mind; a thought vanishes, and with it, things dissolve into the mind. Yet the heart does not itself generate from things—its mechanism lies in the eyes and ears. The heart does not itself perish from things—its mechanism also lies in the eyes and ears.

If at that moment black and white were indistinguishable, beauty and ugliness unrecognized, then the heart would align with the boundless void—how could it then generate life and death?

The mechanism lies in the eyes, and they stir upon contact. A single glimpse of beauty, and love arises suddenly; a single sight of ugliness, and hatred deepens. Thus, desiring what is loved, the heart generates from things—this is the heart arising from things. Hating what is despised, the heart dies from things—this is the heart perishing from things.

Trace its origin—is this the heart’s true nature? It is all the mechanism of the eyes.

Thus, the Sage of old had the *Inner Observation Canon*, the Daoists had the *Curtained-Eyes Method*, the Confucian admonition *"Do not look at what is improper"*, and the Buddhist purification of the eye-root—deep in meaning, their principles are not distant.

Yet even the blind have desires—is the mechanism solely in the eyes? Hence it is said: the heart and eyes are interdependent. The Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Symbol Classic* (Commentary, Volume Two, Volume Three).

The text reads:

**The Cloud Peak Dispersed One, Summer Yuan Ding, of the Zheng-Yu lineage, writes:**

The *Classic* states: **"The heavens have no particular favor yet great favor arises."**
Swift thunder and fierce winds—none fail to stir. What does the heavens possess in mind? The four seasons march in order, myriad things flourish and grow, yet only when frost and snow congeal, when ice and dew are severe, do all things attain the principle of returning to their roots and fulfilling their nature. This is indeed the heavens having no particular favor yet great favor arising.

Moreover, when swift thunder and fierce winds arise in spring and summer, all auspicious growth and vitality thrive—even the slightest movement of creatures with vital essence proceeds smoothly in accordance with their natural purpose. As it is said: **"Within the midst of raging flames, true treasures are forged."**
Those who study this should grasp the principle of *killing-qi* (杀机), the interplay of *harm and benefit* (反覆害里), the *generation of favor from what seems without* (生恩造无), ascending to the *Mysterious Origin* (上之玄元), becoming the master of both heaven and humanity.

**Extreme joy is the nature’s excess; extreme stillness is the virtue’s purity.**
Emotions have sorrow and joy; nature is extreme joy. Desires have movement and action; the Dao is extreme stillness. This is how the distinction between immortals and mortals begins.

Those who study should seek first to take delight in their innate nature, ensuring no trace of exhaustion or depletion weighs upon them. Then, sweet and tranquil, they naturally align with the Dao. But when the seven emotions and six desires are unstable—sorrow and joy without constancy, movements inviting calamity, daily entangled in dusty nets—how can one speak of joy in nature or purity in stillness?

**The heavens’ utmost partiality is its ultimate impartiality.**
The Way of heaven is impartial, yet in the matter of *inner alchemy* (金丹), it seems to have partiality. The heart of heaven is partial, yet in the great Dao, it appears impartial. How so?

Humans receive their endowment from heaven: a single point of luminous awareness and true enlightenment, the *threefold meditation* (三昧) of effortless natural fire, the primordial unity of *pre-heaven* (先天), and the essence of *true unity* (含真)—without great or small, noble or base, immortal or mortal—all receive full measure. This is the heavens having no partiality.

Yet those who follow the Way: the rising and falling of yin and yang do not fail their season, the union of sun and moon does not err in timing. They summon thunder, evoke rain, command winds, and flash lightning—truly capable of revolving the heavens and earth, taming dragons and subduing tigers. Divine achievements arise, and marvelous brilliance emerges, with ineffable wonders beyond conception.

But those without the Way are the opposite: yin and yang lose their proper cycles, sun and moon fail their appointed conjunctions. What power do they have over thunder, lightning, wind, or rain? A body preserved merely to be a vessel for food and drink is better than one consumed by debauchery and medicinal poisons. Is this not the heavens’ partiality toward those with the Way and impartiality toward those without?

I have seen those with the Way: they live long and dwell in the world, enduring exhaustion yet ascending as immortals; those without the Way: they suffer lingering illness, swiftly decaying like grass and wood. Thus, the heavens’ utmost partiality is its ultimate impartiality. Should one not be warned?

**The principle of creatures lies in their *qi* (气).**
All things that live receive a single *qi*. Even the smallest of birds, soaring through vast space, though aware of their six wings and myriad feathers, could not rise without the fullness of that *qi*. If scholars understand this, they should preserve and nurture the *original harmony* (元和), cultivating their divine *qi* to be most vast and firm, filling heaven and earth before ceasing.

Does not the *Classic of Poetry* say: **"The kite flies to the heavens, the fish leaps in the depths—all by the movement of *qi*."**
Is this not close in the body, far in all things?

**Life is the root of death; death is the root of life.**
Favor arises from harm; harm arises from favor.
To comprehend the transformations of creation, one must know the roots of life and death; to illuminate the great Dao, one must recognize the meaning of favor and harm.
This principle—apart from the five phases of creation and the alchemy of *inner elixir*—how else could it be understood?

Moreover, gold is born in the *perilous month* (巳), dies in the *water month* (子), yet the *water month* is the realm of water, and gold can generate water. Then is gold truly dead? Wood is born in the *boar month* (亥), dies in the *horse month* (午), yet the *horse month* is the domain of fire, and wood again can generate fire. Water and earth are born in the *monkey month* (申), die in the *tiger month* (卯), yet the *tiger month* is the position of wood, and water can generate wood. Thus, life is the root of death, and death is the root of life.

Yet the roots of life and death are fixed, while the meaning of favor and harm differs. Only the alchemy of gold and fire cannot be judged by life and death.

The *Dragon-Tiger Supreme Classic* (龙虎上经) states: **"Gold and fire are the true medicines."**
In the art of inner alchemy, nothing surpasses gold and fire. Fire is born in the *tiger month* (寅), dies in the *rooster month* (酉), yet the *rooster month* is the realm of gold, and its fire can only subdue gold—how could it generate gold? Moreover, the *rooster month* is the domain where gold thrives, while fire is in the place of its demise. Unable to subdue gold as harm, yet gold rewards its flourishing as favor. But gold does not generate itself—it must rely on what generates it, and only earth can generate gold, while fire again generates earth. Without *wu-ji* (戊) and *ji* (己), no alchemy can be completed.

Ah! The five phases generate and subdue one another—profound and subtle principles that few scholars grasp. As for the theory of *inner elixir*, many speak of it with delight yet fail to delve deeply into its mysteries. I must further clarify these distinctions to enlighten those who come after.

Why does the inner and outer alchemy not exceed the five phases of creation, yet it is not simply called *water-fire-wood-earth elixir*, but specifically *gold elixir*? Because the heavens first generate water: *kan* (坎) is the palace of water, water being the mother of all things. Those who cultivate the true must first focus their attention on the *kan* palace.

Yet the water of the *kan* palace does not generate itself—only gold can do so. Thus, the *original beginning’s pre-heaven qi* transforms and generates through gold.

An ancient song says:
*"Use lead or not use lead,
Must act within lead’s embrace.
When the time to use lead arrives,
Using lead is still a mistake."*
Lead is the mother of gold; gold is the mother of water; water is the mother of the elixir. Such is their principle of mutual generation and completion.

The Great Dao does not rely on mutual generation for its function, but on mutual conquest for its efficacy. Is it not because gold can conquer wood, reducing it to exhaustion, wood can conquer earth, leaving it hollowed out; earth can conquer water, causing it to dissipate into emptiness; water can conquer fire, extinguishing it utterly? Though fire conquers gold, gold remains unbroken—when smoke vanishes and flames fade, the gold’s essence grows only more resilient. The *Paramartha Contract* states:
*"Gold enters fierce fire, yet its luster remains untainted."*

Is this not harm giving rise to benefit, benefit arising from harm? Thus is it called *gold-liquid return elixir*, called *immortality*, called *returning to the origin and source*—for it is solely the gold within water, in one essence alone.

If the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—if their vital essences, fluids, *qi*, blood, and liquids—do not share the same form or substance, yet their life and nature are interrelated, their principles may be spoken of, but the Dao itself cannot be spoken. For there are *zuancu* (攒簇) and *hehe* (合和), medicinal substances and fire refinement, true and mundane, guest and host. The sages transmit medicines, not fire—without meeting a true master, one must not presume. Without swearing blood oaths to Heaven, drawing talismans on the earth, no one may recklessly impart [these secrets]. Violators invite calamity upon nine generations, with disaster striking first upon themselves. Zhang Pingzhu’s transmission to the unworthy led to three punishments—how could one not take heed?

The foolish revere the patterns of Heaven and Earth as sacred; I regard the patterns of time and things as profound. The wise may pity the foolish, but I transcend both wisdom and foolishness—others may await [enlightenment], but I do not. Foolishness, wisdom, virtue, and sagacity all share the same beginning; yet by the breadth of one’s heart, their achievements differ in measure.

Moreover, Heaven, Earth, time, and things all bear patterns and principles, their laws and symbols manifest, neither internal nor external. If one can observe above and below, then through contemplation one becomes sage, through clarity one becomes wise. Yet from foolishness to wisdom, from wisdom to sainthood, all stem from the expansion of the heart. Thus, the foolish may preserve the vast patterns of Heaven and Earth within their observation of above and below—even reaching sainthood is possible. But I am constrained by the narrow patterns of time and things, confined to the daily and mundane, barely attaining wisdom alone.

Once sainthood and wisdom diverge, purity and impurity part ways. When the foolish attain sainthood, in Buddhism it is called *directly crossing to the other shore*, seeing nature and becoming Buddha; in Daoism, it is called *one attainment, eternal attainment*, ascending to immortality from the earth. A single deluded thought remains pure foolishness; a single awakened thought becomes pure sainthood.

Yet the wise are different. Though they may initially strive earnestly for the Dao, they may later grow indifferent and neglect it. Without constant vigilance, they drift in and out without restraint, clinging or abandoning as they will—thus they may fall back into foolishness without realizing it. If my aspiration is sainthood, how could I settle for mere wisdom and relapse into foolishness?

Thus, I transcend foolishness—not merely to avoid foolishness and attain sainthood, but to surpass even the utmost sainthood. For the sage’s attainment still has limits that can be named, still bound by the patterns of Heaven and Earth. But I, shedding form and discarding intelligence, merge with the Dao, alone transcending all things—how could this be measured or confined?

This is the ultimate transformation of the Great Dao—sainthood is difficult to achieve, but the unfathomable transcendence of the sage is divinity, the very essence of the Gold Elixir’s Great Dao.

When discussing this, one speaks of foolishness, sainthood, and wisdom. At first, one enters the Dao through the patterns of Heaven, Earth, time, and things; ultimately, one forgets these patterns and attains the Dao. It is like the Five Phases of creation, where myriad phenomena flourish—all manifestations of the Dao’s workings. Words and speech, tiles and thatch—all are the Dao’s abiding presence. Within the thirty-six thousand gates, if one treads each step truly and accumulates effort over long months, without forgetting what one can do, one verifies progress by set limits—like Yanzi’s near-sainthood, never straying from *ren* for even three months. Others may reach it in days or months.

But Confucius, who gathered all under one roof, and King Wen, who followed the Imperial Way, flowing above and below with Heaven and Earth—how could their attainment be measured by limits? Those who cultivate emptiness and stillness say, *"Even after eons, it remains empty."* What is there to measure? Yet truly, even if one endures the fires of an aeon, though the Dao may seem destroyed, how could emptiness itself destroy the formless? The Great Dao of the Gold Elixir originates in the *Taiji*, completes in the *Wuji*, operates in the finite, and transcends the infinite—it cannot be described in mundane terms. One must carefully ponder it with the divine and immortal.

To sink into water, to enter fire, to court death by blade—water and fire bring burning and drowning, weapons bring slaughter. Even the wise know to fear and avoid them. Yet now one seeks to drown in water, willingly enter fire, delight in death by blade, unaffected by wind or madness. This is not coercion by form or circumstance—such deeds are deeply pitiful. Why?

Alcohol, lust, wealth, and *qi* are but other names for water, fire, blades, and weapons. To be consumed by them is to burn and drown within—yet they know no fear, and scoff at those who merely practice asceticism and fasting. Even if they live as long as Pengzu and Fuqi, they still endure lonely suffering—why not take pleasure in wine and desire?

Alas, the moth’s futile flight toward the flame—there is no defense, only a long sigh remains.

The Dao of Nature is still, thus Heaven and all things are born.

The Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual, thus yin and yang prevail.
Yin and yang, in their mutual succession, transform and follow the natural order.
Therefore, the Sage knows that the Dao of Nature cannot be defied, and thus aligns with it.

The Supreme Way declares:
*"All things flourish in their abundance, each returning to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called restoring the vital breath.
It is also said: Push emptiness to its utmost, hold steadfast to stillness,
and all things arise together—then I observe their return.
Yet when emptiness and stillness are absolute,
how does the body dwell in doubt within yin,
and from where do all things arise?
But if yin is not extreme, yang does not emerge;
if stillness is not extreme, the Dao remains unseen.
How much more so the Great Dao—formless, giving birth to Heaven and Earth;
nameless, nurturing all things.
If one does not conform to Nature’s spontaneity,
dwelling in utter stillness,
then Heaven, Earth, and all things could never generate.
Man, with his single body, partakes in the functions of Heaven and Earth—
does he not know what stillness is?
His mind is a monkey, his intentions a wild horse,
daily indulging in the fields of profit and desire,
yet what concern has he for the principles by which Heaven and Earth generate?
Moreover, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is like a gradual permeation—
from one yang to six yangs, from one yin to six yins,
all growing by degrees, never advancing abruptly.
Thus, yin and yang in their succession follow Nature’s order;
only the Sage knows this,
and within *wuwei* there is action,
in utmost motion there is utmost stillness,
causing all things to arise from stillness.
Who but the Daoist can comprehend this?
The Dao of utter stillness—
even the calendar’s measurements cannot grasp it.
It is like the ways of birds and beasts.
The laws of the calendar,
calculating celestial cycles,
have seventy-two *xiàng*,
twenty-four *qi*,
four seasons and eight nodes,
and the phases of new moon, full moon, and crescents—
all are precise degrees that cannot be defied.
Yet in regulating the calendar and clarifying time,
in meticulous computation,
one might doubt it contradicts the principle of Natural *wuwei*.
Only the Sage, whose Dao reaches utter stillness,
whose heart aligns with the Great Void,
allows yin and yang to rise and descend,
to transform and nurture naturally,
without the slightest contrivance—
if such precision as the calendar is excessive,
is it not akin to the ways of birds and beasts?

Now, birds and beasts—these are the crow and hare.
The crow and hare—these are the sun and moon.
The sun and moon—these are water and fire.
Water and fire—these are yin and yang.
Yin and yang—these are Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth—these are the Great Dao of purity, stillness, and *wuwei*.
The Great Dao—this is the study of penetrating principles, exhausting nature,
and reaching the essence of fate.
Nature and fate—this is the art of longevity and immortality,
the method of the Golden Elixir.
There exists a marvelous instrument,
giving birth to all phenomena.
The Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems—
divine mechanisms hidden like ghosts.
The arts of yin-yang victory are clearly manifested in the symbols.
Ah, the Dao! How vast it is.
Ah, the words! How profound they are.
*The Yin-Shu Classic* is the Yellow Emperor’s secret utterances of the Dao.
I dare not hesitate, but explain its meaning,
recklessly revealing celestial mysteries.
Observing the end from the beginning,
a few words summarize the whole—
like the *xuan* of the *Qian* hexagram,
embracing the great meaning of all sixty-four hexagrams.
Its exploration of hidden depths and distant reaches
is not easily fathomed.
Ah, how wondrous and restful it is!
I dare to bow twice in reverence.

Through gradual cultivation, its meaning is made clear.
As for the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir,
within the body there exists a marvelous instrument—
not necessarily forged by smelting.

The **Yin-Shu Classic** speaks of the **Dao** of the **Golden Elixir**:
The furnace shaped like a reclining moon,
The hearth of the **Taiyi**,
The tripod with neither inner nor outer vessel,
The most refined and sacred elixir—
this is the source of all phenomena,
all arising from the **natural Way**.

**Dongbin** said: *"Within a single grain of millet lies a world,
and within three sheng of a cauldron, the mountains and rivers boil*—"
is this not true speech?

Thus, in terms of the **Eight Trigrams**,
**Kan** and **Li** are the foundation;
in terms of the **Zhou Tian** cycle,
the hour of **zi** comes first.

Its **divine mechanism** is wondrous, with uses beyond measure;
its **hidden essence** is unfathomable, neither concealed nor revealed.

When **Yin** overcomes **Yang**,
then water and fire achieve **jiji**—the union of opposites;
when **Yang** overcomes **Yin**,
then sun and moon form **hebi**—the joined pearls.

The **Golden Crow** has the power to grasp the **Jade Rabbit**,
the **Wooden Dragon** possesses the **virtue/power** to subdue the **Tiger**;
the **tortoise and serpent entwine at the neck**,
the **clamshell and pearl** hold their treasure—
these suspended symbols shine brightly,
almost impossible to conceal.

Is this not the meaning of *"full and thus radiant"* as **great**,
*"great and transforming"* as **sage**,
*"sage and beyond measure"* as **divine**?

This **Dao** is indeed the concern of **our Confucian scholars**.
The unenlightened call the **Golden Elixir** a heterodox and twisted learning—
this is like one who sits in a well and gazes at the sky,
and claims the sky is small.
Is the sky at fault?

**Cloud Peak’s Dispersed Notes by Summer Yuan Ding, of the Yu School**

Cloud Peak says:
Who can depart without passing through the gate?
Why else does one traverse this **Dao/Way**?

For the gate is a barrier.
Only after passing through the barrier does one walk the **Dao/Way** upright.
If the barrier is not closed,
then reckless, wild, and licentious behavior will arise,
and deviant, perverse, and extravagant habits will flourish.

Thus it is said:
Within are three barriers—
**virtue/power** as the master,
**qi** and spirit as the root.
This is what is meant by *"constantly gathering and returning to the origin,
never letting it escape outward."*

Without are three barriers—
the mouth as the pivot,
ears and eyes as the keys.
This is what is meant by *"the evils of the nine orifices lie in these three openings."*

These are all matters of daily practice,
the **Dao/Way** of the *Doctrine of the Mean* and the **Great Dao/Way**.

The **Dao/Way**, like a broad road,
who would not travel it?
At its beginning,
even women and children can comprehend it,
yet when it reaches its depths,
even the **sage** has things unknown.

Thus it is said:
*"To be sung is to be **virtue/power**-filled,"*
*"To be possessed is to be **true**,"*
*"Full and thus radiant is to be **great**,"*
*"Great and transforming is to be **sage**,"*
*"Sage and beyond measure is to be **divine**."*

This **divine** state—
is it not the **Dao/Way** of subtle and brilliant illumination,
manifest transformation and communion with the **spirit**?
This is the secret essence of the **Golden Elixir**.

**Commentary on the *Illustration of the Sage’s Water-Fire Functions***

Cloud Peak says:
The **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth—
one **yin**, one **yang**, primordial **qi** harmonized,
and all things are born.

The suspended symbols reveal their brilliance—
none greater than the sun and moon.

The Great Sun is true fire,
its symbol aligning with the southeast,
arising from wood and generating life;
Its outer manifestation is spring and summer,
giving birth to all things.

The moon is the Great **yin**, true water,
its symbol aligning with the northwest,
arising from metal and nurturing growth,
bringing order and destruction to all things.

These two—
the very mechanisms of Heaven and Earth’s birth and death,
thus called Water-Fire,
the **Trigrams** *Kǎn* and *Lǐ*,
Lead and Mercury,
Dragon and Tiger—
other names are countless,
yet all refer to the sun and moon.

The **sage** observes Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,
discerning its waxing and waning,
revealing its hidden depths,
and divides the sun’s fire and moon’s water into the Eight **Trigrams**,
taking two parts of the sun’s fire as *Lǐ*,
one part of the moon’s water as *Kǎn*.
Once one and two are divided,
the **Trigram** forces differentiate,
thus forming sixty-four variations.

For the first fifteen days,
*Kūn* generates *Zhèn*,
which transforms into *Duì*;
*Duì* transforms into *Qián*,
and the **yang** force reaches completion,
hanging suspended to illuminate the east.
Metal and water harmonize gently,
and when metal’s force is full,
true water naturally arises.

For the last fifteen days,
*Qián* diminishes into *Xùn*;
*Xùn* returns to *Gèn*,
and *Gèn* diminishes into *Kūn*.
*Qián* and *Kūn* then unite,
the sun and moon intermingling,
their utmost subtlety and refinement
beyond all thought and reckoning.

Even among mortals, spirits, and ghosts,
or the most disparate beings,
not a hair can be concealed.

Great indeed are the bodies of sun, moon, Heaven, and Earth!

If a mortal can exhaust the **sage’s** functions of sun and moon,
then the eclipses and phases—
observing Heaven’s patterns and embodying its laws—
they can align with the movements of Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon.
How could they not transcend the mundane and attain sainthood,
escape death and enter life?

**Commentary on the *Illustration of the Ten Thousand Symbols***

Cloud Peak notes the *Yin-Shu Classic* saying:
*"Here are wondrous instruments,
which give birth to the ten thousand symbols.*
Eight **Trigrams**, ten stems, and heavenly mechanisms—
the **spirit’s** workings are hidden like ghosts.
Great indeed are these words!

A mortal’s body is itself a wondrous instrument,
where all symbols are complete,
and **spirits** and ghosts guard and sustain it—
this is the utmost treasure.

The **Supreme One** says:
*"A mortal’s body is hard to obtain,
the Central Land is hard to be born in,
and if one is born there,
the True Law is hard to encounter."*

Master Ping Shu says:
*"First establish *Qián* and *Kūn* as the cauldron,
then bring the Mercury and Lead elixir to cook.*
Why seek *Qián* and *Kūn* beyond the void,
or take Mercury and Lead from the sun and moon’s palaces?

Thus one knows:
The wondrous instrument lies within the body,
the ten thousand symbols are complete in oneself.
The *Two Principles* (**yin**/**yang**), the *Three Luminaries* (sun, moon, stars),
the *Four Symbols* (four cardinal directions),
the *Five Phases* (wood, fire, earth, metal, water),
the Eight **Trigrams**, the Nine Palaces,
the Ten Stems, the Eleven Celestial Influences,
the Twelve Earthly Branches, the Twenty-Four Solar Terms,
and the sixty-two **Hexagrams** of the *Zhou Tian*—
all are complete within a mortal’s body.

If one can look upward and downward,
aligning with Heaven and Earth’s **yin**/**yang** in creation,
then the mechanisms will be sealed in perfect accord,
and **spirits** and gods will be unable to measure.
The Three Realms (**Heaven**, **Earth**, **Humanity**) will stand together,
eternal life and prolonged vision will be attained—
how far could the **Dao/Way** of the Immortal be?"*

**Commentary on the *Illustration of the Three Teachings United***

Cloud Peak says:
The Three Teachings follow different paths yet converge at the same destination—
the ignorant create distinctions among them.

They say that the **Buddha-Dharma** and **Dao** are empty and void,
unworthy of comparison with our Confucian learning—
this is indeed correct.

Yet when speaking of the **Supreme One’s** response to human extremes,
their words do not match ours.
But when it comes to cultivating **True Nature** and nurturing **virtue/power**,
or the **Dao/Way** of rectifying the heart and cultivating sincerity,
the boundaries are not easily drawn.

Only the **Chan** school’s gate stands apart,
its teachings so divergent that I wish to dispel its confusion.
Yet I have never grasped its essential meaning.

One day, I pressed the venerable **Master Monticulus** (Meng An),
asking how the **Dao/Way** of **virtue/power** and transmission of the lamp is expressed.
He spoke at length without ceasing.

In essence, he said:
*"The **Dharma-body** is the void,
the void is the **Dharma-body**.*
And he earnestly instructed me to reflect upon it,
specially lighting incense and candles
to verify it with the Three Jewels.

After a short while,
when the tea was finished,
he suddenly called for a novice to attend to the matter,
then withdrew with me to the back veranda.
Outside, he washed his hands and removed his armor,
rearranged his robes,
and invited me to return to my seat,
saying, *"The old monk is quite hungry—
let us share a bowl of soup and cake."*

I then questioned him:
*"Just now, you spoke of the **Dharma-body** and void,
the void and **Dharma-body**,
yet now hunger and thirst cannot be avoided—
how do you distinguish between defilement and purity?
You cannot deceive me with this void—
how do you reconcile this?"*

Master Monticulus was stunned,
with no words to answer.

When we reached the hall,
I saw a copy of *The Snow Cave Record*.
At the time, I read it.

Within, there was a monk asking Master Zhiwen:
*"What is the **Dharma-body** of **Prajña**?"*
He replied: *"A clamshell containing autumn’s moon."*

The monk asked: *"What is the **Prajña**’s use?"*
He replied: *"A hare carrying a fetus."*

Not only does this settle the world of **Chan**,
it also secures the foundation of the realm.

「If one can truly grasp the essence of contemplation,
then let him walk alone beneath the Red Sky.

The monk asked: *"What is the **Buddha’s** supreme matter?"*
He replied: *"The staff’s tip lifts the sun and moon."*

Again, the **Patriarch** asked **Master Nanquan**:
*"The **Māṇi pearl** is not recognized by ordinary people,
but the **Tathāgatagarbha** is personally collected within.
What is the **Tathāgatagarbha**?"
**Nanquan** replied: *"The one who comes and goes with you is the **藏** [treasure/essence]."*

The **Patriarch** said: *"A man of straw."*
**Nanquan** replied: *"The one who neither comes nor goes is also the **藏** [treasure/essence]."*

The **Patriarch** said: *"Frost upon snow."*
The **Patriarch** asked: *"What is the **珠** [pearl]?"*
**Nanquan** replied: *"At the hundred-foot staff’s tip, you play tricks—
this is not the hand of a master.
Here, grasp the eye of understanding,
swap host and guest,
and you shall enter the tiger’s den.
If not so, even if the **Patriarchs** and **ancestors** have penetrated to the core,
it remains but a **dragon’s head and serpent’s tail** [superficial attainment].
Thus, I pointed out to **Master Monticulus** a glimpse of truth to cure his affliction.
At that moment, he attained great awakening,
and returned the **monk’s incense** to me.
Indeed, I know the **Three Teachings** have no distinction—
the original face is but one,
only their **manifestations** differ.
Therefore, I record this to proclaim to all enlightened scholars of the world.

**Diagram of Pre-Heaven and Post-Heaven** says:
**Master Yunfeng** said: *"Pre-Heaven is when the **Tàijí** [Supreme Ultimate] has not yet divided, its unity undifferentiated—
who is **yang**?
Who is **yīn**?
Since **Dào** [Way] gave rise to **One**,
its **form** is already revealed,
its **function** already sprouted.
Thus, **One** is the **odd number**,
the **coordinate** of the **Qián** [Creative] hexagram,
the symbol of **pure yang**.
Post-Heaven is when **Hóngmáng** [Chaos] is split,
and **One** becomes **Two**—
**One** is the **couple number**,
the **coordinate** of the **Kūn** [Receptive] hexagram,
the symbol of **pure yīn**.
Since **Qián** and **Kūn** differ,
and **yīn** and **yang** are divided,
their transformations vary—
how then is this the **Dào** [Way]?
Only through the marvel of **golden elixir**,
returning to the root and source,
seeking the root and plucking the fruit,
embracing the **feminine** and holding **One**,
discarding **yīn** and taking **yang**—
not seeking **unity** in **Qián** and **Kūn**’s difference,
nor seeking **harmony** in **yīn** and **yang**’s division.
Thus, the **different** and the **divided** are Post-Heaven,
while the **unified** and the **harmonized** are truly Pre-Heaven.
Pre-Heaven is the **original ancestor**,
the **primordial qi’s** original face;
Post-Heaven is the **corrupt and miraculous**,
the **Four Great Elements** falsely combined.
The **enlightened observer** sees all—
if one knows the **self** is but **illusion**,
and only the **Dào** [Way] is **true**,
then to **reclaim the light** and **return the reflection**,
and to **begin cultivation swiftly** is already too late.
**Diagram of the Upper and Lower Magpie Bridge** says:
Also called **Qūjiāng Wū Bridge**—
**Master Yunfeng** said: *"Lǚ Dòngbīn’s *Qìn Yuán Chūn* [Autumn Garden Spring] states:
‘Above **Qū River**,
the moon’s light is clear and bright,
a magpie flies.’
Indeed, the **magpie** is the **crow**.
**Qū River** is where the **bridge** exists.
The **three-legged crow** dwells within the sun,
the crow belongs to **yǒu** [the hour of 7–9 p.m.],
and **yǒu** belongs to **metal**.
The crow is the **metallic essence** of the West,
the **yang soul** of the sun,
able to fly above the **Qū River**,
thus the magpie can cross the **bridge** to ascension.
But why must the bridge be divided into **upper** and **lower**?
Because the **qi-pulses** are interconnected—
one who can cross the **lower bridge** must surely be able to cross the **upper bridge**.
Those who can cross are **ascended immortals**,
those who cannot cross remain **common mortals**.
The **Buddhist** tradition of **tying the horse to a locust tree**,
or **tying the donkey to a stake**,
also conveys this meaning.
Yet, they cling to the **good path of death**,
stubbornly facing the wall,
unable to make the **crow fly** or the **magpie cross**—
thus they fall into the **second category** of attainment.
But their **ancestral method** was not so—
it is only later generations who err in confusion.
The details are seen in the **Three Teachings Unified** explanation.

**Diagram of the Seventy-Two Seasonal Phenomena** says—»

「Yúnfēng annotates *Yuánshǐ Mìyán* thus:

*"Vague and indistinct*—from fire arises spirit;
*Remote and obscure*—from water arises essence.
Fire blazes upward, sevenfold transformations birth spirit;
Water descends, sixfold transformations birth essence.
Seven and six transformations—upper and lower complete each other.
Spirit and essence intermingle, the wondrous body enfolds the True.

Spirit undergoes seven transformations to birth True Fire,
Essence undergoes six transformations to birth True Water.
The wondrous numbers of seven and six—thirty-three—
None surpass the Water and Fire of Heaven and Earth.
Thus, the Heavenly Phenomena comprise thirty-six Yang days to birth Fire,
The Earthly Phenomena comprise thirty-six Yin days to birth Water,
Together forming the Seventy-Two Phenomena—
And the full cycle of Heaven’s revolutions is complete.

*The Daoist Canon* states:
*"Thirty-six above Heaven, thirty-six below Earth,
The Great Mysterious transcends all bounds—
Wondrous indeed is the *Great Cavern Scripture*."*

Yet, they speak not of the Five Phases but solely of Water and Fire—why?
Because Water and Fire are the Sun and Moon.
*The Yīnfú Jīng* says:
*"The Sun and Moon have their numbers,
Great and small are fixed by decree—
From here arise the Sage’s works,
From here arise the Divine and Illuminated."*

If a person can gaze upward and downward,
And grasp the secrets of the Fire Phenomena,
Then they harmonize with Heaven and Earth in **virtue/power**,
And unite with the Sun and Moon in **illumination**—
Such may be called **ascended immortals from the earth**.

**Diagram of the Five Phases’ Transformations** says:
Yúnfēng states:
*"The Great Ultimate divides and gives birth to the Two Principles—Heaven and Earth.
Once Heaven and Earth have form and name,
They cannot evade their numerical revolutions.

Thus, Heaven’s One births Water,
Earth’s Two births Fire,
Heaven’s Three births Wood,
Earth’s Four births Metal,
Heaven’s Five births Soil—
These Five Phases weave the fabric of Heaven and Earth’s transformations,
So the Five Qi circulate and shift,
Cold and heat alternate,
The Heavenly revolutions unfold—
Their patterns may be discerned and understood.

Hence, thirty-six days of **Jiǎ** and thirty-six days of **Yǐ**,
And the Wood Phase’s **qi-numbers** are complete;
Thirty-six days of **Céng**, thirty-six days of **Dīng**,
And the Fire Phase’s **qi-numbers** are complete;
Thirty-six days of **Wù**, thirty-six days of **Jǐ**,
And the Soil Phase’s **qi-numbers** are complete;
Thirty-six days of **Gēng**, thirty-six days of **Xīn**,
And the Metal Phase’s **qi-numbers** are complete;
Thirty-six days of **Rén**, thirty-six days of **Guǐ**,
And the Water Phase’s **qi-numbers** are complete.

Combining five times seven—thirty-five—
And calculating them,
We obtain three hundred fifty days, plus two and a half—ten days,
Together totaling three hundred sixty days—
Then the revolutions of the twelve months in a year show no discrepancy.

The remaining days of Heaven’s revolutions
May be accumulated into intercalary months for further calculation,
Thus shaping the myriad transformations of the cosmos.

Now, humans are the most refined of all things,
Yet they are oblivious to the Five Phases’ revolutions—
They merely see the day and night cycle,
The four seasons pass and change,
But fail to grasp the Five Phases’ transformative **virtue/power**,
Which truly governs all creation—
Wondrous indeed! Wondrous indeed!

From *Yellow Emperor’s Yīnfú Jīng* Lectures,
Annotated by Yúnfēng, Volume Four of the *Pharmacopoeia Mirror*’s Preface.»

The Left Historian’s Palace Attendant and Morning Petitioner, **Liú Yuán Gāng**, composed this in praise of **Xù Zōngyǔ** of Dongjia—his bold and unconventional strategies, his service in the imperial secretariat and frontier outposts, his misfortunes unmatched in kind. Wandering freely, he sought the arts of ascension and return, desiring to receive them in silence, to meet with his disciples in private letters, and to present his writings to me.

Once, **Sū Shì** remarked that **Ānqī Shēng** was known in his age as a transcendent. Yet the *Records of the Grand Historian* state: *"Qúo Tōng, a skilled man from Qi, knew Ānqī Shēng. Shēng sought audience with Xiàng Yǔ with strategies. Yǔ could not employ him, and though he wished to bestow honors, both men refused and departed."* Each time I read this, I cannot help but lay down my book in sigh—who, if not such men, are the true transcendent ones?

Thus, the scholars of the Warring States—like **Lǔ Zhònglián** and **Yú Qīng**—were they not also men of the Dao? **Yú Qīng**, unable to endure the suffering of **Wèi** and **Qí**, secretly left for **Zhào**, only to be imprisoned in **Liáng** and stripped of his office, reduced to writing in despair. **Qúo Tōng**, though his counsel went unheeded, feigned madness as a shaman, fled to **Héngkè** and **Cānshān**, composing his own theories—was he not also one who attained the Dao? He refused to serve in office, upholding lofty principles, debating the harm of **Wèi** and **Qín**’s imperial schemes, dismissing the governor of **Liáochéng**. When offered gold, he declined, saying:

*"What the world values in its worthies is their ability to dispel calamities, resolve difficulties, and settle strife without seeking personal gain. If they do seek gain, then they are no better than merchants—and I cannot bear to act thus."*

When pressed for office, he said: *"I would rather endure poverty and obscurity, defying the world with my will, than bow to wealth and honor, bending to others."*

Ah! Only one such as **Lǔ Zhònglián** could truly be called transcendent. **Ānqī Shēng**’s name appears in histories and scattered records, yet his deeds seem too fantastic to be true. If he were like **Lǔ Zhònglián**, striking his palm to summon a rainbow, or like the legendary **Zhāng Liú** and **Gāng Dé**, who bore mountains and wielded cauldrons—both accounts are clearly erroneous. Yet his lingering spirit remains. Thus, it is said that those who govern the world may also transcend it, ascending like dragons.

**Zōngyǔ**’s elucidation of the *Three Books of Gold Elixir* surpasses the mundane, fixed in eternal truths beyond the world, unlike the *Eight Chapters of the Marvelous*, which merely mocks power and political maneuvering. His work is the true successor to **Lǔ Zhònglián** and **Ānqī Shēng**. As for **Yú Qīng** and **Qúo Tōng**, they were merely strategists—how could they compare?

**Recorded on the fifth day after the Winter Solstice, in the year *Bǎobǎo Bǐngxū* (1256), by Qīngyuān Zhīyún Shānrén.**

**Yúnfēng’s Continuation:**
*"Summer clouds bear strange peaks"*—a phrase the Jin poets delighted in. I, in my fleeting guise, adopt this fleeting name, truly adding legs to a painted snake and a neck to a decoy bird. Perhaps some will imitate the *Grand Historian*’s fondness for the strange, or steal the poet’s clever phrases, to display themselves. Alas! Summer is one of the four seasons, and clouds are but one breath of *qi*—where do these peaks arise? What is this strangeness? They rise without intent, follow the dragon without trace, bring rain or drought, stir wind or storm—thousands of wonders, transformations beyond measure. Yet these are not my intent.

Is it not that the **Heavenly One** clears with purity, the **Earthly One** settles with tranquility, the **Jade Emperor** holds the balance, and the **Flame Sovereign** blazes above? The south wind blows gently, the sun shines like steam, the **Fire Umbrella** burns fiercely, melting gold and stone. These are not mere clouds, nor mere peaks—they are the **Celestial Worthy’s** gathered essence, the **Divine Spirit’s** concentrated will.

The **Bright Hall** opens vast, the **Purple Court** stands serene. The **Venerable Lord Dīng** refines the golden essence. **Kūnlún** thrives in splendor, the **Jade Well** shines deep. The **Primordial Furnace** glows warm, the **Crescent Crucible** flickers bright. The **Cyclical Winds** blend, thunder crashes in harmony. Above, it pierces the **Celestial Apertures**; below, it descends into the **Mysterious Depths**. The **Four Celestial Guardians** and **Six Divine Warriors** attend. The **Circumferential Heaven’s** revolutions are complete—nine transformations, ascension achieved.

How then is **Yúnfēng** merely a strange name? Profound is the Great Dao—Heaven and Earth’s **virtue/power** unite. Before **Yuánshǐ**’s breath divided into yin and yang, what was heavy and what was light? When **Hóngméng** was cleaved, Heaven, Earth, and Man were born—Man, the most refined. The revolutions of transformation endure through the eons. The **Black Tortoise** and **White Tiger** symbols stand clear, the **Lunar and Solar cycles** align. Yet in the ninth month, when the **Summer Solstice** lingers, the clouds alone bear peaks.

When the **Regal Stem** reaches the third **Five-Day Period** of summer, fire must retreat westward. The **Golden Elixir’s** mysteries lie in fire’s essence. The clouds rise with fiery *qi*, the peaks manifest divine form. The **Water Phase’s** marrow is refined, the **Heavenly Stem’s** and **Earthly Branch’s** essences are seized. Yin’s malevolence is dispelled, pure yang is perfected. Heaven and Earth complete their work—death yields to rebirth.

**Yúnfēng’s** strangeness is beyond comprehension. Who but the **True One** could unveil its secrets? Some may stand speechless, exclaiming only *"How strange!"*—yet they fail to see that Confucianism is too rigid, Buddhism too stagnant, while the Dao equals the **Great Void**, yet holds its roots. Heaven and Earth vast, the Dao gives birth; myriad things scatter, the Dao sustains; the sun and moon traverse east and west, the Dao governs. These clouds as peaks—it is the Dao that manifests them.

I have seen the **One True Reality**, unmoving yet commanding all spirits. The two breaths interweave, generating all things. Who knows—are these clouds the peaks, or the peaks the clouds?

Thus, the **Seven Returns and Nine Reversions**, the **Eight Reunions and Six Residences**, the **Mystic Pearl’s** formation, and the **True Person’s** emergence—all are **Yúnfēng**. Profound! Mysterious! How could mere poetic phrases capture its essence?

**Recorded by Dǒuchéng Xià Yuándǐng.**

**Yúnfēng’s Self-Introduction:**
Disturbance is the root of worldly affairs; stillness and clarity are the **Pharmacopoeia Mirror’s** essence—this is **Cuī Gōng**’s profound teaching. Is it not that man’s life is but a temporary assembly of the Four Great Elements? Tears, saliva, semen, blood, and bodily fluids—all are yin’s impurities. Lust, greed, anger, and delusion—all are worldly entanglements. Only the **Pharmacopoeia’s** stillness and clarity can subdue them.

What is this *"medicine"*? It is **cinnabar** and **wood essence**, refined with gold—thus they become one.

---
*(Note: "Urine" was omitted in the original text’s context; "精津" typically refers to seminal essence in Daoist alchemical texts, while "液" may imply bodily fluids or alchemical distillations. Adjusted for coherence with Daoist medical terminology.)*

What then is the **Mirror**?
It is **Lingming Zhenjue**—the return of radiance, the reflection of light.

Thus, the **Sage** teaches through the **Dao of Spirit**, using the sun and moon as the *Yijing*;
the **Daoist Way** takes **Divine Clarity** as its core, using the sun and moon as **elixir**.
The **Buddhist** who wields the staff to point at the sun and moon, who transmits the **Nature** and passes on the **lamp**—all speak of the same **thing**.

**Master Cui**, with boundless compassion, skillfully conveyed his teachings through metaphor.
Thus, **Lu Dongbin** said:
*"Seeing Master Cui enter the **Pharmacopoeia Mirror**, one’s heart becomes suddenly clear."*

Truly, he is the **Teacher of Heaven and Man**.

I have examined the hidden teachings three times,
and obtained seven copies of the *Pharmacopoeia Mirror*—
each differing in text.
This **Sutra** contains **243 characters** in total,
its words concise yet profound,
like the *Taoist Canon’s* deepest secrets,
or the *Spring and Autumn Annals’* orthodox doctrine.
It reveals the subtle, explores the hidden,
and exhausts all possible meanings—
the very **pivot and hinge of the Golden Elixir**.

On the **Changjie Festival**, passing through **Babao**,
I rested at **Peng Zhongfu’s** study,
where, amid the incense of his stove,
I was asked about the **Dao**—
thus, I have written this brief annotation
to leave for the present age.

Let those with **clear vision** also send this to:
**Hu Jizhe**, the **Lingyuan Child** of **Yuzhang**,
and **Wang Hefu**, the **Yuanmo Child** of **Tiantai**—
both disciples of the **Daoist Way**.

**Summer Yuan Ding’s Postscript**

**Professor Wang Jiŭwàn of Xīn Chùzhōu Prefecture’s School, a Modest Scholar of the *Xiùzhí* Rank, Composed This:**

Li Dìhóu, at seven years old, already mastered letters,
having read ten thousand volumes before donning the robes of the **Daoist adept**,
and devoting himself to the **Way of the Immortals** as if for life.
Only the careless and reckless could dismiss him with:
*"Speak no more—take the post of Chancellor for ten years."*
Later, when the **Marquis** plotted for his nation,
his wisdom and strategy rivaled even **Zhang Lǐng** of old.

Men say those of the **outer world** must abandon the world and sever ties with all things—
is this so? Or is it merely that those who grasp the **Dao**
use such detachment as a stepping-stone, not as their final resting place?

In **Yǒngjiā**, **Xià Yúnfēng** as a youth,
wielded his whip among the halls of the **Grand Masters**,
seeking their counsel.
Later, he moved among armies, earning rewards through merit,
rushing about in **Shāndōng** and **Héběi**.
On sunny days, he bowed before **Kǒng Lín’s** grove,
to nourish the boundless **virtue/qi** within his breast.
Finding the world’s concerns unworthy of his mind,
he resigned his post and sought the **Dao**.

One day, he unveiled his annotated **Three Books**,
and the common folk could only stare in awe—
as if this were all they could grasp.
How could they ever comprehend?

The **Dao** of longevity was whispered to me by my ancestor, the **Zēng** family’s **once-great-grandfather**, **Dànshèng Gōng**—whose surname was **Zēng**—who, during the **Xuānhé** era, once accompanied **Lǚ Yuánzhí**, the Chancellor, and **Huò Ānguó**, the Grand Secretary, as the three bore imperial commission to transport grain to **Yàn**. At that time, the rebellious **Guò Yàoshī**, **Liú Shùnrén**, and **Zhāng Lìnghuī** harbored treachery within their ranks. The three envoys, in unison, submitted a memorial requesting abandonment of **Yàn**, defying the will of the **Dàtā** (i.e., the court), and were thus demoted, barred from departure. The cunning barbarians grew ever more bold, and the three envoys exerted themselves to the utmost, guarding against peril night and day without rest. It was then that **Zēng Dànshèng Gōng** mastered the **shénshǒu-qì** (spirit-guarding-qi) technique, and afterward lived to eighty-nine, dying without illness.

The day before his passing, he still called for a lamp to write in small script, replying to **Lǐ Bójì**, the Chancellor. Among his words, **Yán Yízhòng**’s disciple had once inquired about the **Dao**, and **Zēng Dànshèng Gōng** spoke: *"Men know that qi is the substance, yet they do not know that one must govern qi with shén (spirit). If shén and qi separate and do not uphold each other, this is not the refined practice of nurturing life."*

Now, to govern qi with shén lies in **zhèngxīn-chéngyì** (rectifying the heart, sincerity of intent), seated in repose while counting the breaths in and out. For breath is qi, and counting is shén. Qi is like a horse, shén like its driver—when shén guides the ebb and flow of qi without separation, then longevity is attainable.

The *Zhuāngzi* says: *"The True Person’s breath originates at the heels; the common man’s at the throat."* If breath does not lodge in the throat but instead dwells in the **Dāntián-Qìhǎi** (elixir field-sea of qi), and one neither disturbs shén with thoughts or desires nor agitates qi with haste—if one gently counts it, until the count becomes boundless, from shallow to deep, from coarse to subtle, from presence to emptiness—then harmonious qi fills the space between crown and sole, and one cannot distinguish qi as shén or shén as qi. Its subtlety transcends speech.

Is this not akin to **zuòwàng** (sitting-forgetting)?

As for assisting with **jīngshēn-ànmó** (classical medical techniques of stretching, pressing, and massage), it also does no harm—so long as one does not grow weary.

**Huìyōng** once remarked: *"This is the **tāixī** (embryonic breathing) method, yet it is but the remnants of the *Cāntóng Qì* (Harmonizing the Triple One)."*

But who could compare it to **Yǒngjiā Xià Yúnfēng**’s **jīndān** (alchemical elixir) **Three Books**, transcendent and self-actualizing, manifesting wonders, communicating with the numinous, and displaying the luminous and subtle?

Yet **Yúnfēng** began his cultivation as a youth and attained the **Dao** on **Héngshān**, while later spending over a decade amid military affairs—his path, though differing in era, mirrors that of **Yèhóu** (i.e., **Xià Yúnfēng**’s earlier life). Now, under the **Sage Emperor’s** vigilant rule, extraordinary scholars arise to restore the realm. Let **Yúnfēng** take **Yèhóu’s** resolve as his own, first stabilizing the **Zhōngyuán** (Central Plains), and then seek **Zǐfáng** (Zhang Liang) shall not be too late.

**Wǔyú Shānrén** (The Man of **Wǔyú Mountain**) prefaces this in **Bǎoqìng Dīnghài**.
