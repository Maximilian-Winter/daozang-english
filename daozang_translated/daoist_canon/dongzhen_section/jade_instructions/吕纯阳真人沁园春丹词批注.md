**Lü Chunyang the Perfected One’s "Spring in the Garden of Qin" Elixir Lyric with Annotations**

**Scripture Title:** *Lü Chunyang the Perfected One’s "Spring in the Garden of Qin" Elixir Lyric*, originally annotated by Yu Gong of the Yuan Dynasty. One fascicle. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category.

**Annotations by Linwu Shanren Quanyangzi**

**Sevenfold Return Elixir:**
Seven is the number of fire. The method of elixir refinement first involves the red entering the black to generate the medicine. Once the medicine is obtained, fire is then applied to refine the black into the red, thus forming the elixir—hence the name *Sevenfold Return Elixir*. This does not refer to the seven hours from *yin* to *shen*. As Zhang Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* states:
*"The Metal Duke was originally the Eastern House’s son,
Sent to the Western neighbor to lodge and grow.
Once recognized and called home to be nurtured,
He is matched with the maiden to form kinship."*
This is the meaning here.

For the practitioner, one must first refine the self and await the proper time. The *Li Sao·Far Roaming* says:
*"Let not the soul be disturbed, for it will naturally align;
The single qi, most numinous, abides in the midnight hour.
Abide in emptiness to await it—do nothing before it,
This is what it means to refine the self and await the time."*
The key lies in withdrawing the gaze and returning the hearing, remaining still and unmoving, concentrating the spirit in the Great Void, without a single stray thought. After a moment, the spirit enters the qi, and qi unites with spirit, so that the true breath naturally settles, and numinous clarity naturally arrives—this takes but a brief instant. As Shao Kangjie’s *Primordial Chant* says:
*"If asked of the Primordial, a single word is absent,
Only in the Posterior does effort become necessary."*
The elixir method is likewise: seeking the medicine in the Primordial is non-action, while applying fire in the Posterior is action. They cannot be treated as one and the same.

**At the first stirring of the true yang,**
As Bai Ziqing’s *Pearl and Jade Collection·Song of the Elixir Marrow* states:
*"To refine the elixir, one need not seek the winter solstice,
For within the body, a single yang naturally arises."*
How then do I know when the single yang stirs within the body? It is when, in the snap of a finger, the *xun* gate suddenly opens, and the heart feels a moment of vagueness—that is the time. At this moment, I rouse it with the bellows and forge it with fierce fire, so that true lead emerges from *kan*, and the river chariot does not dare to pause even briefly. It is transported to the summit of Kunlun Peak, where the Return Elixir may then be formed. As Shao Kangjie’s *Vague and Elusive Chant* says:
*"Vague and elusive, yin and yang first transform,
Bound and compressed, heaven and earth begin to revolve.
Within, a fleeting fine scene appears—
How can effort be put into words?"*
Without penetrating insight into the transformations of yin and yang, who could know this?

**As the midnight water-clock endures,**
Midnight refers to the *zi* hour. The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* states:
*"Embracing the primal in *xu* and *wei*, sowing essence at *zi*,"*
and also:
*"Between the dark and new moons, the tally moves in accord."*
This refers to the time before midnight on the fifteenth day of the lunar month, the interval between the dark and new moons. If applied to a single day, then every night before the *zi* hour is the interval between the dark and new moons—it is not restricted to the midnight of the fifteenth day. As the *Awakening to Reality* says:
*"The sun and moon meet once every thirty days,
Exchanging time for days, the divine work is made clear."*
The *water-clock* refers to the dripping clepsydra. There are internal and external clepsydras: the internal is the breath’s exhalation and inhalation. As Xue Zixian’s *Restoration of Life* says:
*"This heart is like a fire in chaff,
In silent sitting, the sound of the dripping clepsydra is heard."*
The external is the night watch clepsydra. Some may question the *Awakening to Reality*’s statement:
*"One must know that great reclusion dwells in the marketplace,
Do not seek solitude in the deep mountains,"*
not realizing that in the deep mountains, lamps and clepsydras are hard to come by. Others may ask: Chen Niju’s *Green Void* says:
*"If you say the clepsydra is unreliable,
You will not grasp the mysterious mechanism, and the medicine will not form,"*
yet it also says:
*"By day, observe the gnomon; by night, watch the clepsydra—
This is a grave error."*
Why do these statements contradict each other? The answer is: at the beginning of cultivation, when skill is not yet refined, one may err in timing, so an external clepsydra is set as a standard. But when skill is perfected and the elixir field is seeded, essence arises at the proper time, and when the time comes, the spirit knows—even in sleep, one awakens without needing a call. Why then rely on a clepsydra? *Enduring* means its drops follow one another without interruption. Sought within the body, the true breath should be continuous and unbroken, no different from the ceaseless flow of clepsydra water.

**The lead cauldron glows warmly, its light piercing the curtains.**
Lead is the medicine; the cauldron is the lower elixir field. As the *zi* hour approaches, yang qi subtly stirs below—hence the warmth. The *curtains* are the eyes. Lowering the gaze has the appearance of drawn curtains, hence the term. When the elixir field holds the medicine and yang qi rises, it penetrates the space between the brows, producing light. This is like a candle in a room: the light shines through the window, but the brightness is not from the window—it is from the candle. Some, upon suddenly witnessing this scene, may be startled into delight, taking it as something marvelous. But if the heart stirs and the spirit scatters, how can one hope to complete the elixir? Is success not then far off?

**The workings of creation race onward,**
This refers to the initial moment before *kun* returns to *fu*. At that time, a single strike of the jade bell opens the twin caves of the Jade Grotto. As the *Restoration of Life* says:
*"From both sides they ascend together, sharing a single pound."*
**Tiger and dragon unite in mating,**
The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"The dragon calls to the tiger, the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence,
Both feed upon each other, mutually devouring."*
In making the elixir, the key is for heart and breath to depend on each other, so that spirit congeals and qi gathers, uniting in mating to form the medicine. As Chen Chaoyuan’s *Book of Jade Mushrooms* says:
*"If the mysterious and yellow remain two and do not unite,
How can yang fly up from beneath *kan*?"*

Thus, only when yin and yang unite in mating and the elixir forms within the cinnabar field may the firing process begin.

**The firing work follows the constellations Ox, Dipper, Rooftop.**
Ox, Dipper, and Rooftop mark the directional positions of the firing process within the body. This means the firing work begins at *zi* and culminates at *yin*, just as heaven’s creatures take form in the womb at *zi* and emerge at *yin*. The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"It begins in the northeast, in the region of Winnowing Basket and Dipper,
Then turns rightward, the wheel revolving to sprout the germ."*
The *Cui Xu Pian* says:
*"There is a path where mother and child part at birth—
Its wonder lies in Tail, Winnowing Basket, Ox, and Maiden,"*
echoing the same principle. Some interpret Ox, Dipper, and Rooftop as the struggle of *dou* and *wei*, citing the *Wu Zhen Pian*:
*"Grasp with both hands and force them to fight to the death,"*
to elucidate the point—another valid reading.

**By Qujiang’s banks, the moon’s radiance gleams bright,**
The *Cui Xu Pian* says:
*"On the southwest path, the moon’s radiance shines—
The great elixir is born from this place.
Recall the ancient verse:
*By Qujiang’s banks, the magpie bridge spans the sky.*"*
Ancient immortals identified the nine coils and twelve bends of the small intestine as Qujiang; later adepts also applied the term to the space between nose and mouth. Both interpretations hold. Yet the *Cui Xu* further clarifies its meaning through the southwest path—truly profound and illuminating. The southwest corresponds to *kun*, the abdomen. When the elixir forms in the cinnabar field, intestinal *qi* ascends, illuminating the eyes with light. Thus, from the eyes to the navel, the entire path shimmers with an empty, luminous whiteness like the moon’s radiance.

**A crow takes flight.**
When a crow takes flight, it signifies the union of heaven and earth within the body, the merging of *kan* and *li*, as the two *qi* intertwine and condense into a single dewdrop that alights in the cinnabar field. Chen Xiyi’s *Zhi Xuan Pian* says:
*"A crow flies into the osmanthus palace."*
The *Cui Xu Pian* states:
*"The red lotus holds the elixir—
Dewdrops congeal into jade,
Dripping drop by drop into the flowery pond."*
The *Zhu Yu Ji*’s *Huan Yuan Pian* says:
*"One who grasps this truth
Will see a single drop fall into the Yellow Court."*
Bai Ziqing’s verse reads:
*"Now I see through it—
The golden crow flies into the toad’s cavern."*
All express this same meaning.

**Then, of one’s own accord, one drinks the *daogui*.**
Medical texts speak of the *fangcun bi* and the *daogui*. The *daogui* refers to the merest speck at the tip of a knife’s edge. Some interpret the knife as metal and the *gui* as the union of two earths—an overly elaborate reading, not the ultimate teaching. "Drinking of one’s own accord" means traversing the three palaces before descending into the mouth, aligning with the *Wu Zhen Pian*:
*"Shedding the embryo to enter the mouth, the body attains sagehood."*
Some doubt: if the embryo has already been shed, why return to the mouth? They mistakenly believe the elixir comes from without, swallowing external substances—far from the Dao. Does not the *Cui Xu Pian* say:
*"Gather and refine it, though but for a moment—
A single breath, faint yet boundless, passes through the three barriers.
The *qi* flows endlessly through the three barriers,
A white pulse ascending to the mud-pill palace.
Above the mud-pill palace stands the purple-gold crucible,
Within it, a lump of purple gold—
Transformed into jade nectar, it flows into the mouth,
Fragrant, sweet, and refreshing across the tongue."*
Could this come from outside oneself? Who would believe that the *wu* is nurtured from nothing?

The Great Way of the Golden Elixir is most simple and most easy, giving rise to being from non-being and nurturing the infant within. Such things as nasal mucus, saliva, essence, fluids, *qi*, and blood may serve only as auxiliary aids or stepping stones—they are not the substance of the elixir. Scholars, confined by their narrow views, often cling to preconceived notions and refuse to study the elixir texts further. Even when a true adept seeks to enlighten them, who would believe it?

The *Cui Xu Pian* says:
*"A strange thing makes men laugh and turn their heads—
Now even the male *wu* can conceive an embryo.
One’s own essence and blood conjoin of themselves,
Within the body, husband and wife are wondrous indeed!"*
For "husband and wife" are but alternate names for *yin* and *yang*—there is no true husband or wife. Yet some stubbornly adhere to the saying "mending bamboo with bamboo," believing in "supplementing man with man," and thus fix their minds on the perverse practices of the Three Peaks. How can they then trust that the Golden Elixir is the Dao of pure non-action, truly giving rise to being from non-being?

**Discerning the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source:**
The distinction between clear and turbid has been discussed before. One view holds that heaven is clear and earth turbid by nature; another, that drawing the clear and discarding the turbid is even more profound. Today, regarding the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source, let us examine the term "water source" itself. As "heaven’s one gives rise to water," its position lies in the north, where all waters converge—hence it is called the water source. The *Cui Xu Pian* says: *"Hasten to gather the hundred vessels and return them to the source,"* referring precisely to this. That which is above is called clear; that which is below, turbid. At first, above and below intermingle, blending into one. Over time, they gradually settle and gradually clarify, until supreme joy arises within.

Liu Haichan’s *Returning Gold* says: *"When the water stills, it congeals into amber."* As for the theory of retaining the clear and discarding the turbid, that is another matter. In my commentary on the *Cantong Qi*, I have already explained in detail that the bodily form becomes like ashes or dust, resembling the fine dust on a bright window—here I shall not repeat it.

**Wood and metal separated by a barrier:**
Within the human body, there is one thing divided into two: that which floats is wood, and that which sinks is metal. One lies in the east, the other in the west—hence they are said to be separated by a barrier. If one grasps the mechanism of the Dipper’s handle and employs the *qian* trigram to make them circulate above and below like the flowing of the Celestial River, then the nature of wood will love metal, and the essence of metal will long for wood, and *xing* and *de* will unite without separation.

Some claim that when the two eyes’ light converges at the center, wood and metal are no longer separated—this is one interpretation. Yet when examined against the *Cantong Qi* and *Wuzhen Pian*, the meaning of "wood and metal separated by a barrier" lies within, not without. Without a teacher’s guidance, how could one ever know?

The *Wuzhen Pian* says:
*"Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,
Without meeting a true adept, do not force your guesses."*
For the elixir texts often employ metaphors to clarify principles or establish symbols to convey meaning. Their terms and concepts differ, and when scholars read them abruptly, they are often left bewildered, like one gazing at the ocean.

Take the five phases, for example: sometimes they speak of metal and wood, sometimes metal and earth, sometimes water and fire, sometimes metal and fire, sometimes metal and water, sometimes wood and fire, sometimes water and earth. This leaves one’s mind and eyes dazzled—truly not easy to comprehend.

**The essential subtleties of the Dao:**
The essentials of the elixir Way are two: *jiaogou* (union) and *jinhuo* (advancing the fire). Though they follow a sequence, they are in truth a single effort. Xiao Zixu’s *Great Compendium of the Golden Elixir* says: *"The work within the moment is wondrously subtle."* Profound indeed! Subtle indeed! The heavenly mechanism runs deep and far.

The "heavenly mechanism" refers to the moment when *zi*-yang first stirs at midnight. As the heavenly mechanism approaches, if one can rouse their own mechanism to respond, then heaven and human unite in activation, inner and outer align, and the elixir coalesces. Though it is said that any of the twelve hours’ junctions may serve, the ancient immortals invariably used the moment when *zi*-yang first stirs at midnight, for at that time the great yang is precisely in the north, and the qi in the human body reaches the *Weilü* Pass—thus resonating with heaven and earth. This is what is meant by "stealing from heaven and earth, seizing the workings of creation," and only at this time is it so. By the *chou* hour, the great yang has already shifted, and the qi in the human body has passed the *Weilü* Pass. By the *yin* hour, the great yang has emerged from the earth, and the qi in the human body has passed the *Shentang*. Neither may be used. *The Jade Mushroom Scripture* states: "In refining the elixir, one must kindle the fire in accord with the *zi*-hour yang qi; only then is the fire complete. If kindled at any other time, the fire is imperfect." These words exhaust the matter.

To begin practice is already too late. "To begin" refers to the moment of refinement, when one gathers the spirit of the entire body into the *Tiangu* Cavity and does not let it stray—this is not a matter of literal grasping. Some may cling to the phrase "to begin," taking it to align with the *Awakening to Reality*’s line, "Seize with both hands and force them into mortal combat." Thus they strain with clenched fists, or cover their ears and nose, or rub their waist and abdomen, or press their thumbs into their palms, or press their middle fingers against their navel—is this not labor in vain? "To begin practice is already too late" speaks to the swift passage of time and the urgency of timely cultivation.

The path to Penglai relies on the fulfillment of three thousand deeds before one may stride upon the clouds and return. "Three thousand deeds" refers to nine years of three thousand days. Within these three thousand days, one must accumulate merit and deeds, never straying from the Dao for even a moment in the twelve hours. Liu Xugu’s *Returning Elixir Chapters* says: "Great work nears completion in three thousand days; wondrous practice knows no lack in the twelve hours." The elixir method: the embryo forms in an instant, the work proves efficacious in a hundred days, the embryo rounds in a year, and the deeds fulfill in nine years—all proceed by degrees. There is no principle by which one may meet a master today and become an immortal tomorrow.

Know that in one year there is small attainment, and in nine years a great transformation: first the qi is refined, then the blood, then the vessels, then the flesh, then the marrow, then the sinews, then the bones, then the hair, then the form. After nine years and nine transformations, yin qi is fully refined into pure yang, and only then may one leave the world behind, transcend the mortal realm, and ascend as an immortal. Zeng Zhiyou’s *Collected Biographies of Immortals* records Chen Chaoyuan’s admonition to the world: "Those who do good deeds will surely enjoy blessings; those who accumulate hidden virtue will see their descendants flourish. To cherish heaven’s gifts, not indulge in theft or deceit, and not destroy the true teaching—these are good deeds. To save the dying, aid the suffering, rush to others’ distress, and never harbor hidden malice—these are hidden virtues. Without good deeds or hidden virtue, the paths of evil will find entry everywhere." Chaoyuan’s words were meant for the common folk—how much more do they apply to those who study immortality?

In general, to cultivate the Dao of immortality, one must first cultivate the human Dao. If the human Dao is not cultivated, the Dao of immortality remains distant. Have you not seen the *Awakening to Reality*’s words: "The great medicine is cultivated with ease or difficulty—it depends on me, or on heaven"? Without accumulating deeds and bestowing hidden virtue, obstacles and demons will arise at every turn. How can scholars take the saying "my life is in my own hands" as an excuse and not treat the accumulation of merit as urgent?

Alas! When three thousand deeds are fulfilled, one becomes an immortal of the Great Veil. When eight hundred deeds are fulfilled, one becomes a guest of the Great Veil. Let our fellowship strive together.
