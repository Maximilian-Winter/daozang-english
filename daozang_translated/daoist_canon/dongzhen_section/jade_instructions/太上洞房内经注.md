**Preface to the Commentary on the Supreme Cavern Chamber Inner Scripture**
By Perfected Zhou

The Dao may be studied, yet profound contemplation is truly difficult.
Immortality may be sought, yet utmost refinement is truly difficult.
The Perfected may be seen, yet nurturing the will and nature is truly difficult.
Jade Maidens may be summoned, yet cultivating purity, cleanliness, and stillness is truly difficult.

Thus, the Eight Simplicities take true contemplation as their foremost; secret teachings take the Nine Perfected as their inner scripture; divine methods take refined contemplation as their deepest; returning to youth takes penetrating the real as its spiritual attainment; the Great Cavern takes the Most High as its origin; the Great Elixir takes the Three Simplicities of the Feminine One as its inner essence; Lord Lao takes spontaneity as supreme; the Supreme takes Non-Flourishing as purity; the Yellow and Lao take the will and nature as the Dao; the White Prime takes cleanliness and stillness as integrity; the Perfected seek union through the will; the essentials of immortality are fulfilled only when refinement resonates with the Dao.

These are all the most precious aspects of the Dao—ponder them and practice accordingly.
If contemplation does not resonate, the Dao will not come; if refinement is not subtle, one drifts far from the real.
Do not harm life for the sake of death; do not compromise integrity for lust.
Do not drunkenly contemplate the Dao; do not seek life through deviance.
Do not advance through glory and rank; do not regard ghosts as divine.
Do not treasure wealth; do not indulge in excessive adornment.
Do not take the vulgar as joy; do not let the ears be swayed by sounds.
Do not mistake filth for purity; do not allow the body to lose its refinement.
There is much that one must not do.

In visualizing the Cavern Chamber, be cautious of what I forbid.
Few are born naturally knowing the Dao—cultivate and practice it, study and refine it.
Laozi said: *"The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it."*
How true these words are!

The *Great Cavern* is called a true scripture because it attains the utmost of true essence.
That profound contemplation is difficult refers to the challenge of visualizing the Cavern Chamber.
If one can be subtle and mysterious, refined contemplation will resonate and reach fulfillment; if one visualizes Non-Flourishing, then the Dao of the Perfected is complete.
The *Outer Radiance of Laozi* states: *"The essential subtlety of longevity lies in the chamber’s secrets."*
When you are in the Cavern Chamber:
- If you see the White Prime Lord on the right, the Dao of immortality is achieved;
- If you see the Yellow and Lao Lord in the center, you will live ten thousand years;
- If you see the Non-Flourishing Lord on the left, you attain the utmost essence of the real.

When the Three Lords appear, you will ascend to heaven in broad daylight, wearing a flowing bell and tiger talisman, roaming the Upper Clarity. Those whose conduct in the world accords with virtue will have their names recorded; without such virtue, do not hope for immortality.

Those born with the following marks need not study the Dao—they are destined to become immortals:
1. A golden register and jade name at birth;
2. A white record in the Great Mystery Palace;
3. A large character on the left hand;
4. A green will on the back, resembling the River Chariot;
5. Seven-star markings on the body;
6. A purple light in the crown, illuminating their form;
7. A crane’s gait and dragon’s bearing, with a network of patterns on the body;
8. Nine apertures in the heart and a green cavity beneath the lungs;
9. Five qi rising from the head, connecting to layered clouds;
10. A jade-like voice and golden resonance, with purple qi issuing from the mouth.

Those born with these traits need not study the Dao—they are certain to become immortals.
Next are those born in an undying realm;
Then those with azure bones;
Then those whose conduct surpasses the ancients;
Then those whose virtue equals the highest worthies;
Then those who single-mindedly devote themselves to the Dao, focusing on the subtle and mysterious, whose hidden virtues flow freely, and whose actions never deviate from the Dao.

Next are those whose will and conduct are pure and refined, whose nature is harmonious and kind, who are gentle, generous, warm, and benevolent—whatever they visualize will resonate.
Those who study the Dao in this way can attain immortality.

Next are those whose ancestors have bestowed blessings, whose seven generations have cultivated virtue, who have rendered service to the Three Officials, and who have never offended humans or spirits—if they themselves diligently practice the Dao, they may also become immortals.

Next are those whose ancestors have immortal names, who have rendered great service to the Three Officials, and who have performed three hundred good deeds—they may attain immortality.

Beyond these, even if one’s talents and qualities are profound and brilliant, surpassing the world, without the aforementioned traits, one’s efforts will be in vain—there is no hope for immortality.

The essential point is that those born with a bone record must have the will for immortality.
Now, I transmit to you the Dao I have received—beware of passing it to the unworthy.

Formerly, there was Su Zixuan, a foreigner who excelled in practicing the Three Ones and became an immortal of Mount Zhong. In my early devotion to the Dao, I encountered various beings who bestowed upon me divine mushrooms and taught me the immortal path, transmitting to me the inner characters of the *True Instructions on the Yellow Court Outer Scripture* of Lord Lao. I revered and practiced it, ascending to become a Perfected.
Now that you study the Dao, I record and transmit this to you—follow it in practice.

To visualize the White Prime Lord of the Cavern Chamber:
Always at sunrise, when the dark radiance first arises, stand facing east, bow twice, close your eyes, and inwardly gaze. Hold your breath and swallow saliva one hundred and twenty times. Then visualize the great spirit of the Crimson Palace within the Jade Chamber, and you will see the White Prime Lord.
Practice this morning and evening as a constant method.

On every *jiazi* day, at midnight when the qi of life arises, loosen your hair, apply powder, clasp your hands over your knees, ingest qi, and swallow saliva one hundred and forty times. Then call the name of the spirit of the Jade Chamber. When you hear a response like a person’s voice in your ears, or the sound of scripture recitation, that is the sign of resonance.
At this point, rub your eyes with both hands fourteen times, then stop.

The essentials of this practice require pure clothing and bedding; be cautious of yin qi approaching. Seek a secluded chamber in a quiet room, where the ears hear nothing, the eyes see nothing, the mind holds nothing, the body is still, and the spirit is harmonious—only then proceed.
If you are near the mundane world, observed by others, or encounter sorrow, terror, or shock, the spirits will be averse. Visualization will not resonate, and practice will not succeed.

I bow twice, reverently practice this, and after visualizing the Cavern Chamber for five years, I indeed saw the White Prime Lord on the right within the chamber, clad in dragon robes and tiger sashes, standing properly on the right.

I could not help but smile inwardly, knowing the Dao must come to fruition. Thus, I wandered through the Five Marchmounts and renowned mountains of the world, where I encountered immortals who orally transmitted the oral instructions of the Dao—altogether five hundred seventy-odd matters. These I shall gradually impart to you; guard them well and cultivate them in secret, taking care not to transmit them to the unworthy.

Long ago, I ascended the Central Marchmount, Mount Songgao, where I opened the Cavern Court and entered the Cavern Gate. There I encountered the Yellow and Old Lord. I kowtowed twice and bowed my head, declaring: "I, Zhao, am but a defiled mortal of this impure world, stained by the filth of dust. For seventy years, I have secretly cherished a single heart, privately admiring the Great Dao, with the aspiration to become a spirit-immortal. The true Dao is profound and distant, its numinous wonders deep and far-reaching. Though I have wandered the Five Marchmounts and traversed renowned mountains, occasionally encountering immortals from whom I received the mysterious instructions, my stubborn impurities remain untransformed, and I have yet to ascend near the Way. Now, as the Double Mystery unfurls its radiance and the light of the sun returns, I have been graced to behold your true countenance and receive the illumination of your numinous splendor."

Thereupon, I knocked my head to the ground and entreated, making my lifelong wish known: "I pray you take pity and bestow upon me the divine instructions." The Yellow and Old Lord said: "Have you visualized the Cavern Chamber and seen the White Prime Lord?" I advanced, knelt long, and replied: "I have indeed seen the White Prime Lord." The Yellow and Old Lord said: "You are not yet sufficient. Continue your wanderings and receive the true instructions of the various immortals. Only then shall I transmit to you the scriptures of the Supreme Perfected."

I again knocked my head and struck my breast, repeatedly entreating, begging to serve as a messenger, attending the Dragon Chariot. The Yellow and Old Lord said: "You possess a name inscribed in gold and jade; you shall become a Perfected One. What cause for worry have you? Having seen the White Prime, your immortal affairs are complete. If you wish to become a Perfected One, you must visualize the Peerless Lord. Should you behold the Peerless Lord, the true Dao will be accomplished. Visualize him thus; I shall not test you further."

I again declared myself, entreating for the oral instructions of the Cavern Chamber and the Inner Chapters of the Great Lord. The Yellow and Old Lord said: "Within the utmost essence of the Cavern Chamber resides a great spirit, ineffable and not yet your due to receive. Withdraw, purify yourself, and return; then I shall transmit them to you." Thereupon, I bowed twice and respectfully received his teaching.

I withdrew and purified myself at Shaoshi for three months, then ascended Mount Taishi and re-entered the Cavern Gate, where I again beheld the Yellow and Old Lord. The Yellow and Old Lord said: "Now I transmit to you the Inner Scripture of the Cavern Chamber. Visualize this spirit, always at midnight when the generative qi arises: sit upright, clasp your hands upon your knees, hold your breath, close your eyes, and inwardly gaze. Recite this invocation: *'Triple Prime’s peerless qi, Supreme Mystery’s purple palace, Yellow Gate’s golden chamber—within resides the great spirit, crowned with blossoming diadem, canopied in purple, clad in dragon robes with tiger patterns, issuing from cinnabar and entering the void, summoning yang and calling forth yin. The celestial Dao possesses a true one, named Peerless. Uphold me, engender me, and with the Dao abide forever.'*"

I bowed twice, received the teaching, and reverently practiced it. After twenty-seven years, I beheld the Peerless Lord and again visualized the Yellow and Old Lord. The Yellow and Old Lord transmitted to me the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*. Thereupon, I rode clouds and mounted dragons, ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

This scripture is most secret; now I transmit it to you. Guard it well and do not pass it to the unworthy.

**Commentary on the Inner Scripture of the Cavern Chamber by the Yellow and Old Lord:**

The Yellow and Old Lord is the Lord of the Dao of the Center. He governs the Cloud Court Palace within the Cloud Court Cavern Chamber at the central gate of the Spirit Portal. His spirit is named Bo Tao—this is the Dao of the Great Lord.

Heaven possesses a spirit palace, the Supreme Mystery’s Cinnabar Numinosity. The Supreme Mystery’s Cinnabar Numinosity is the palace of the Celestial Thearch, also named the Supreme Tenuity, the Purple Palace, the Cinnabar Terrace, the Numinous Palace—the abode of the August Celestial Thearch. Its likeness in humans is the Cavern Chamber. Discoursing on the essentials of the Purple Chamber, we first speak of the Purple Palace’s Cinnabar Numinosity.

Heaven possesses the Supreme Chamber, the Jade Chamber’s Cloud Court. The Cloud Court is the abode of the Yellow and Old Lord of the Center; in humans, it resides at the center of the Cavern Chamber. The Jade Chamber is the Cavern Chamber, also named the Purple Chamber, the Crimson Palace, the Hall of Light. Above it is the Flowery Canopy; to its east and west lie the palaces. It penetrates the Yellow Court on the left and right.

It forms the Cavern of Kunlun, lofty and unshaken. Kunlun is the head; the Purple Chamber’s cavern connects to the head, both high and deep. Its likeness is the southern region of Kunlun’s Mysterious Garden and Yellow Chamber. To its south lies the Cavern Court’s chamber, also named the Cavern Gate. Discoursing on the Purple Chamber, we first speak of the head.

It is the abode of spirit-immortals, a golden hall and jade city. The Cavern Chamber possesses a golden city and jade chamber, a spirit palace with fourfold numinous access, where the Mysterious Splendor shines from both sides, and the Cavern Essence dwells amid clouds—the abode of the Three Elders, the spirit-immortals.

Square yet round, within three inches. The Cavern Chamber is square and round, a palace of gold and jade, spanning three inches.

The Yellow Gate and Purple Portal are of utmost mysterious essence. Within the Purple Chamber lies the Yellow Gate, flanking the Yellow Court at the center, forming the Purple Portal. The Purple Portal is also named the Cloud Court—within it resides the Yellow and Old Lord. Within the Purple Portal, it is both mysterious and of utmost essence.

To the left, it connects to the Azure Palace; to the right, it flanks the Luminous Clarity. The left is the Azure Mansion, the abode of the Azure Lad. The right is the Luminous Clarity Mansion, the abode of the White and Pure Jade Maiden. Broadly visualizing them, the Azure Lad may become the Nine Elder Lords; refining and purifying them, the White and Pure Jade Maiden becomes the Mother of the Western Clarity. These are the alternate names of the spirits within the left and right eyes. Visualizing them day and night, one may attain immortality.

Within resides the Great Perfected, ineffable in name. This refers to the great spirit within the Cavern Chamber. The utmost Perfected is subtle indeed. To the left is the Peerless Lord, also named the Prime Essence Lord or the Divine Youth; to the right is the White Prime Lord, also named the Cavern Yang Lord. These are the greatest spirits within the Jade Chamber. Should you concentrate and visualize them with precision, the true Dao will be accomplished.

Who are their parents? They arise naturally from the void. This August Essence and Prime Essence Great Lord of the Dao has no parents; he exists alone and undifferentiated, born before the Great Void. Visualize him day and night without negligence.

Crowned with a blossoming diadem and canopied in purple, girded with flowing golden bells. The Peerless Lord wears a blossoming diadem upon his head and is canopied by a purple spirit-cover. Girded with flowing golden bells, he roams the Supreme Mystery, establishing the true scriptures.

The method of visualization: always at midnight when the generative qi arises, sit upright, clasp your hands upon your knees, hold your breath, close your eyes, and inwardly gaze. Recite the invocation: *"Triple Prime’s peerless qi, Supreme Mystery’s purple palace, Yellow Gate’s golden chamber—within resides the great spirit, crowned with blossoming diadem, canopied in purple, clad in dragon robes with tiger patterns, issuing from cinnabar and entering the void, summoning yang and calling forth yin. The celestial Dao possesses a true one, named Peerless. Uphold me, engender me, and with the Dao abide forever."*

Clad in dragon robes with tiger belts, he recites the *Scriptures of the Cavernous Truth*. This is the White Prime Lord, who likewise wears garments adorned with dragon patterns and bears the talisman of the divine tiger. For cultivation and visualization, always at dawn when the sun rises, face due east, bow twice, hold your breath, close your eyes, and inwardly gaze. Recite the invocation: *"Supreme divine essence, stationed at the Gate of Spirits, clad in dragon robes with tiger belts, crowned with the golden dawn’s blossoming diadem, holding registers and scriptures—this is the White Prime. Roam with me, ascend to the Gate of Yang, traverse the Nine Purities, and return to rest in the Yellow Chamber."* Emerging to feast in the Yellow Chamber, he plays within the Cinnabar Field—the Yellow Chamber is the Cavern Chamber.

The Peerless Lord and the White Prime emerge from the Yellow Chamber, roaming together within the Cinnabar Field. Visualize them day and night without negligence, and you shall surely become a perfected one. Ascending to connect with the Grand Tenuity, at times entering the Cavernous Mystery—the Spirit Hut is the Cavernous Mystery, and the Grand Tenuity is the palace of the August Emperor of Heaven. If you can visualize and behold the Peerless Lord, you shall attain the true oral instructions of the *Scriptures of the Great Cavernous Truth*. This is the true Dao. To see the White Prime Lord is to complete the immortal’s path.

Broadly speaking, the Peerless Lord embodies the primordial essence of truth, while the White Prime Lord embodies the path of the highest immortality. Together they convene within the Six Harmonies, uniting with the Peach Lord of Radiant Convergence—the Peach Lord is the Lord of the Great Dao, clad in vermilion robes and a purple crown, stationed at the Gate of Life. The Peerless Lord and the Lord of the Great Dao enfold their forms within the Six Harmonies; separate scriptures and oral instructions pertain to them.

At times they roam the Seven Gates, penetrating to behold the Yellow Tranquility—the Yellow Tranquility is the name of the spirit of the Yellow Chamber, located an inch above the center between the two breasts. Always at dusk, knock your teeth thirty-four times and recite the invocation: *"Dweller of the Yellow Chamber, clad in the essence of yellow, harmonizing the true flowing qi, circulating through my form, summoning the hun and restraining the po, granting me long life. Draw left and accompany right, the Yellow Numinous concealing the body."* Summon yang and call forth yin, commanding the Six Dings—the yang is the Three Yangs of the Supreme.

The yin is the Three Yins within yang. The Six Dings are divine maidens. When the Perfected One calls forth yang, the Three Qi arrive; when summoning yin, the Three Dragons ascend; when commanding the Six Dings, the divine maidens appear. The method for calling yang is recorded in a separate scripture—the Scripture of the Venerable Lord. The Primal Chaos, a single luminous essence, returns to the Original Yang. The Three Ones are also great deities. The Original Yang is another name for the One. The White Prime Lord and the One enter and exit together, uniting within the Cinnabar Field. The Three Ones have their own guarding scripture and oral instructions.

The Three Subtleties are wondrous indeed: the chamber is the true capital. The Three Subtleties refer to the Muddy Pellet within the head, the Crimson Palace within the heart, and the Cinnabar Field below the navel. All Three Subtleties are truly wondrous, yet the true capital lies solely within the Jade Chamber, most refined and profoundly subtle. Profound and subtle indeed! It exists prior to the Primal. The Cavern Chamber is most subtle, its spirit most refined and true, for it precedes the Void Prime Lord—born of the qi of the Upper Prime.

If you can perceive it, you will ascend at dawn to the Morning. The Morning is a spirit within the Great Subtlety. The Great Subtlety contains Five Palaces; the Morning is the Palace of the Great Ultimate, the hall of the Perfected Ones on its right. Within it is the Jade Chamber: the Lord of Non-Florescence dwells on its left, the White Prime Lord on its right. When essence flows and spirit appears, yang qi forms clouds—the calling of the Three Yangs is the formation of the Three Pures into clouds. When they penetrate the Six Harmonies, the Three Spirits come into view. Then the Three Qi transform into clouds, the so-called clouds of the Three Pures. Penetrating the Six Harmonies, drawing yin and summoning the dragons—the Three Yins within yin and yang—when essence flows and spirit appears, the Three Pures form clouds, penetrating the Six Harmonies, the Three Yins summon the dragons. Riding clouds and driving dragons, the true Dao is complete.

Rising upon purple and emerald, you wander the immortal palaces. The purple and emerald are the canopies of splendor. The immortal palaces are the Palace of the Great Ultimate. When essence reaches its peak and spirit appears, riding clouds and driving dragons, the purple canopy covers you, and the jade maidens Yu and Yuan ascend to the Lord Emperor, wandering the immortal palaces. Thus the immortal Dao is perfected, and you ascend as a Perfected One.

The teachings of the Cavern Chamber are complete—guard them well and do not transmit them recklessly. The Yellow Venerable Lord of the Center has expounded the Dao of the Chamber; guard them well and do not transmit them to the unworthy.

At dawn, noon, and after sunset, visualize the cloud qi of the Five Directions: the green qi of the East transforms into the Azure Dragon; the white qi of the West transforms into the White Tiger; the red qi of the South transforms into the Vermilion Bird; the black qi of the North transforms into the Dark Warrior; the yellow qi of the Center transforms into your own body.

At dawn, recite the ode:
*"Subtle and vast,
The primal qi’s radiant essence!
Majestic and joyous,
The soaring of hun and spirit.
Hidden within my breast,
Its center vast and empty as an outstretched bow.
Bright as the white moon,
It permeates the ten thousand directions.
How luxuriant the magic mushrooms!
No fear of rootlessness.
Exhaling the old, inhaling the new,
To commune with the divine."*

At dusk, recite the ode:
*"Boundless and expansive,
Beyond reckoning with the divine,
Clad in splendor,
Feasting on the dark magic mushrooms.
The Dipper’s handle as my steed,
The Jade Balance as my chariot,
Above and below without limit,
Entering and exiting without time.
A hundred ailments healed,
Spirit and qi held in sole mastery.
The Controller of Destiny records my name,
Inscribed on jade tablets in cinnabar script,
Bound with golden threads,
Wrapped in silk of white.
Countless as the sands,
No room for doubt.
The Great One protects me,
Divine spirits lend their aid."*

Maintain purity, free from thoughts, and recite facing the royal direction or the sun and stars. Those who wear the talismanic register and make covenants with Heaven and Earth, who embody the Dao and delight in the Law, shall recite these verses. Those who fail to follow the proper method will be penalized five hundred years, and the presiding officer will be held accountable.

Avoid reciting these on the days of *wu-chen* and *wu-xu*. The odes are from the *Zhengyi Xuandu Statutes*, Scroll Nine.

Here ends the *Commentary on the Cavern Chamber Internal Scripture of the Most High*.
