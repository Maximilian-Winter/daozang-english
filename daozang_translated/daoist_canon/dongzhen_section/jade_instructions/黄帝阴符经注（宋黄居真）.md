**"The Yellow Emperor’s *Yinfu Jing* Commentary**

**Title:** *The Yellow Emperor’s Yinfu Jing* Commentary
**Author:** *Huáng Qūzhēn* (attributed), likely composed in the Northern Song Dynasty.
**Recorded in:** *Comprehensive Records of the Arts and Literature* (《通志艺文略》).
**Volume:** One scroll.

**Source of the Base Text:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (《正统道藏》), *Tongzhen* (洞真) section, *Yujue* (玉诀) category.
**The Yellow Emperor’s *Yinfu Jing* Commentary** – *Xūjìng* (虚靖) Master, the Purple Robe Daoist *Huáng Qūzhēn* (黄居真), made this commentary.

**The Dao of Heaven, grasping Heaven’s movements—exhausted are they.**
The *Yijing* (《易》) says: *"Observe Heaven’s divine Dao, and the four seasons will not falter."* It also says: *"What ends must begin again—this is the Way of Heaven."*

Heaven’s Dao flows but does not accumulate, hence the sun, moon, stars, and constellations are bound to it.
Heaven’s movements are vigorous yet unceasing, thus the four seasons and myriad things arise from them.
The **perfected sage**, when observing its flow, aligns with it in endless circulation;
when grasping its movements, harmonizes with it in eternal beginning and end.
**Ebb and swell, fullness and emptiness—none can defy them.**
**Breathing and extension, contraction and repose—never without their influence.**
At rest, he shares **virtue/power** with *yin*; in motion, he rides the waves with *yang*.
If such is the case, what further need be added?
Thus it is said: *"The Dao of Heaven, grasping Heaven’s movements—exhausted are they."*

Heaven has **five bandits**—those who see them prosper.
The **five bandits** dwell within the mind yet manifest in Heaven’s operations.
Humans are born from the *qi* of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water,
and also die from the *qi* of metal, wood, earth, water, and fire.
From the perspective of the **perfected sage**,
what joy is there in birth? What harm in death?
That which gives me life is also that which brings my ruin.
Knowing their workings, discerning their shifts—
metal and wood never truly obstruct each other,
water and fire never truly oppose each other.
When the five align and blend as one,
then alone does one endure and remain whole forever.
Why should one weigh birth and death?

To follow is Heaven’s **virtue/power**; to oppose is the **bandit**.
Their origins lie in the mind’s own choices,
yet their manifestation occurs through Heaven’s operations.
**The cosmos lies within the hand;**
**all transformations arise from the body.**
To close the door is called *yǔ* (宇);
to open the door is called *zhòu* (宙).
The cosmos is the greatest of all,
yet it never strays beyond my grasp—
I can make it so that no calamity befalls me,
how much more so for lesser things?
**Growth and decay, movement and stillness—**
these are the myriad things of change,
yet they never leave the confines of my hundred limbs.
I can make them free from Heaven’s **blockages** and **faults**,
how much more so for the few?

Heaven’s nature—**humanity** (*rén*).
The human mind—**the mechanism** (*jī*).
To establish Heaven’s Dao is to **settle** humanity;
Heaven and humanity are never truly separate—
only the **perfected sage** attains this.
To fully embody Heaven’s nature is called **humanity** (*rén*);
to master the human mind is called **the mechanism** (*jī*).
When Heaven’s nature is exhausted,
then the **Three Powers** (*sān cái*) are complete;
when the mind’s mechanism is illuminated,
then one becomes the **master of all things** (*wù zǎi*).

At rest and returning to the root,
one remains **serene and ever tranquil** (*zhànrán chángjì*).
In motion and responding to change,
one **turns and transforms without end** (*wòxuán wúqióng*).
To **unleash the human** and **settle Heaven**,
to **settle Heaven** and **unleash the human**—
then the **profound and manifest** are in secret harmony,
and **transformations** become visible.

If one cannot establish Heaven’s Dao,
then the mind’s impulses will never cease,
and its outward expressions—
how could they not be perilous?
Can birds **align in fixed postures** (*xiāngyú dìng*)?
Thus it is said: *"To establish Heaven’s Dao is to settle humanity."*

When Heaven unleashes the **killing mechanism** (*shā jī*),
dragons and snakes rise upon the land.
When humanity unleashes the **killing mechanism**,
Heaven and Earth **reverse and overturn**.
When Heaven and humanity **unleash together**,
all transformations are settled by the mechanism.
**Natures** have skill or clumsiness,
which can be **concealed and hidden**.
To **transform and adapt**—this is what the mechanism does.
Heaven effects change without speech,
and the mechanism is truly great.

The **perfected sage who establishes Heaven**—
can humanity be without the mechanism?
Yet the mechanism of the mind is not the **ultimate mechanism**;
the mechanism without the mind is the **ultimate mechanism** (*jī de jí*).
The mechanism moves here,
transformations take form there—
all in their natural course.
Thus when Heaven unleashes the **killing mechanism**,
rivers can become land, land can become rivers;
when humanity unleashes the **killing mechanism**,
one can **transcend Heaven’s inability to bear**,
and **transcend Earth’s inability to cover**—
the mechanisms of Heaven and humanity reach their peak here.
Thus it is said:
*"When the killing mechanism is unleashed by Heaven and humanity,
the Three Powers are at ease,
and all transformations are settled by it—
who can escape my mechanism?"*

Though this is so,
the mind arises from **nature**,
the mechanism from the mind.
The **skilled**—humanity;
the **clumsy**—Heaven.
To **obscure the mind and restore nature**,
even the greatest mechanism can be concealed.
The **nine orifices’** evils lie in the **three keys** (*sān yào*),
which can be **mastered in motion and stillness**.
The ear’s **distraction by sound**,
the eye’s **distraction by color**,
the nose’s **distraction by odor**,
the mouth’s **distraction by taste**—
and the **transformations of water and grain**—
all are **evils of yin and yang**.
Among these nine,
the **three keys** are essential:
the ear, the eye, and the mouth.

The ear’s **delusion by sound**,
the eye’s **delusion by color**,
the mouth’s **delusion by taste**—
these are the most severe of evils.
The **sage** can make the nine orifices
not **control** him,
thus it is said:
*"Only the sage can truly embody the form,
in motion yet evils cannot overcome him,
at rest yet evils cannot enter him—
motion is acceptable, stillness is acceptable."*
Thus it is said: *"One can act in motion, one can act in stillness."*

Fire arises from wood,
and **calamity** (*huò*) must be **checked** (*kè*) when it emerges.
**Deceit** (*jiān*) arises from the state,
and **rebellion** (*kuì*) must be **broken** (*kuì*) when its time comes.
Fire can indeed **check wood**,
but when it is **restrained by water**,
then fire cannot act—
calamity must first emerge before it can be checked.
Deceit can indeed **break the state**,
but when it is **overcome by righteousness** (*zhèng*),
then deceit cannot act—
rebellion must first arise before it can be shattered.

Thus one knows:
the **evils of yin and yang**,
the **arising of deceit and rebellion**—
all require **what they await** before they must necessarily occur.
To **know and refine** this is to be called the **sage**.

To know Heaven’s operations,
to know humanity’s operations,
to know stillness and **restoring nature**,
to know motion and **the mechanism**,
to know the **endlessness of all transformations**,
to know the **three keys** among the nine evils—
then one **clears and quiets**,
wandering through the **domain of the spirit** (*shén tíng*).
**Only the origin, only silence**—
this is the **ultimate attainment of the Dao** (*dào de jí*)."

「Thus, when one cultivates to the point of **not clashing with the crafty** (*lìng*),
and refines to the point of **not conflicting with things**,
one remains **serene and simple**, holding to **Oneness** alone.

The **sage** or the **able one** who attains this,
cannot be moved by **creation and transformation** (*zào huà*),
nor constrained by Heaven and Earth—
to **enrich the state and secure the people** (*fù guó ān mín*),
to **strengthen the army and win battles** (*qiáng bīng zhàn shèng*),
these are but trifles in their hands.

Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life—
this is the **principle of the Dao** (*dào zhī lǐ*).
When **yang** expands once, all things cannot but be born;
when **yin** contracts once, all things cannot but be slain.
They are born and slain of their own accord—
who compels them thus?
The Dao’s operations are such.

If one cannot **respond to this principle** (*wù néng*),
then even Heaven’s way of being Heaven would be diminished.
Yet Heaven has no **intent**—
it merely **takes what is due** (*xián zì qǔ*).
Hence it is said: **"This is the Dao’s principle."**

Heaven and Earth are the **"great thieves"** of all things;
All things are the **"thieves"** of humankind;
Humankind are the **"thieves"** of all things.
When the **three thefts** are **properly aligned** (*sān dào jí yí*),
the **Three Powers** (*sān cái*) are **established in harmony**.
Hence it is said:
**"To eat in accordance with the seasons** (*shí qí shí*),
**the hundred bones** (*bǎi huái*) are in order.
To **move with the mechanism** (*dòng qí jī*),
**all transformations** are at peace.
Heaven and Earth are the **greatest forms** (*xíng zhī dà zhě*),
Heaven provides **qi** (*yì*) to nurture the beginning of all things,
Earth provides **form** (*xíng*) to nurture their growth.
Humankind and all things cannot escape the **covering canopy** (*fù zǎi zhī jiān*),
each **depending on the other** (*xiāng yǒu yǐ xiāng chéng*),
each **failing if the other is absent** (*xiāng wú yǐ xiāng fèi*).
They are **unable to stand alone**.

Moreover, what they **do not possess** yet **take** is called theft—
Heaven and Earth do not steal from all things,
yet without them, the **Dao of endless transformations** cannot be fulfilled.
All things do not steal from humankind,
yet without them, the **effect of proliferation** cannot be achieved.
Humankind do not steal from all things,
yet without them, the **function of nourishment** cannot be complete.
Why so?
If Heaven and Earth, being vast,
do not **begin and end with all things**,
then Heaven would **perish in peril** (*jī hū pà*).
Hence they are the **thieves of all things**.
If all things, being numerous,
do not **have humankind to assist and nurture them**,
then they would **perish in peril** (*jī hū nì*).
Hence they are the **thieves of humankind**.
If humankind, being **spiritually endowed** (*líng*),
do not **have all things to sustain and nourish them**,
then they would **perish in peril** (*jī hū tiāo*).
Hence they are the **thieves of all things**.
**Mutual theft** is what makes them **properly aligned**.
Hence it is said:
When the **three thefts** are **properly aligned** (*sān dào jí yí*),
then the **Three Powers**—Heaven, Earth, and humankind—
stand **thus established**.

Humankind knows their **spirit** (*shén*),
but does not know that their **non-spirit** is what makes them **spiritual** (*shén*).
The **spirit’s operations** are indeed wondrous—
if one can **discern its form** (*yì qí zhuàng*),
then it is not wondrous—
this is the **ultimate of spirit** (*shén zhī zhì*).
The *Yì* says:
**"The spirit**—this is the **wondrous principle** of all things,
and **speech** (*yán*) is what it **expresses** (*wéi yán*).
Is this not what is meant by ‘humankind knows their spirit’?"**
It further says:
**"Not hasty yet swift,
not walking yet arriving**—
is this not what is meant by ‘humankind does not know
that their non-spirit is what makes them spiritual’?"**

The sun and moon have their **fixed cycles** (*shù*),
the small and great have their **fixed measures** (*dìng*).
From these **sage’s achievements** arise,
and from these **spiritual mechanisms** emerge.
The sun moves swiftly—
it completes one **circuit of Heaven** (*zhōu tiān*) in a day;
the moon moves slowly—
it completes one **circuit of Heaven** in a month.
Swiftness and slowness have their **natural degrees** (*zì rán zhī dù*),
which cannot be **exceeded** (*bù kě yú*).

That things are not uniform is their **nature** (*qíng*).
The **soaring pheonix** (*guāng féng*) and **great eagle** (*píng*) are vast,
the **wren** (*jiāo liú*) is small—
each **finds its place** in the **nature of life and death** (*xìng mìng zhī qíng*).
Small and great have their **natural measures** (*zì rán zhī liàng*),
which cannot be **changed** (*bù kě yì*).

To **understand the natural cycles** (*míng hū zì rán zhī shù*),
to **harmonize with the small and great** (*yī hū xiǎo dà zhī liàng*),
to **remain still and achieve the sage-ruler’s power** (*jìng ér shèng wáng zhī gōng*),
to **grasp the subtleties and unlock the spirit’s mechanisms** (*miào ér shén míng zhī jī*),
this is where **attainment** lies.

As for **stealing the mechanism** (*dào qí jī*),
none under Heaven can **see** or **know** it.
The **gentleperson** who **holds fast to it** (*yù zhōng*) remains unharmed,
while the **petty person** who **seizes it** (*qǐng mìng*) risks their life.
Heaven and Earth **steal from all things** to **perfect transformation’s subtleties**,
all things **steal from humankind** to **achieve proliferation’s effect**,
humankind **steal from all things** to **fulfill the function of nourishment**—
all are **natural mechanisms**.

These **natural mechanisms** are **operated by the spirit** (*shén zhī yùn*),
yet who **directs and controls** them?
Who **governs and upholds** them?
It seems there is a **hidden mechanism** (*jī guī*) within,
yet none can **halt it on their own** (*zì yǐ*).
The people of the world **use it daily without knowing**—
how could they **perceive its subtleties** (*wū dǔ qí wēi*)?
The **gentleperson’s mechanism aligns with the spirit** (*jūn zǐ jī yǔ shén qì*),
stillness **unites with the subtleties of yin and yang** (*jìng hé yīn yáng zhī miào*),
thus they **preserve their life**.
The **petty person’s mechanism conflicts with the spirit** (*xiǎo rén jī yǔ shén wéi*),
action **follows the shifting of mechanisms** (*dòng wéi jī biàn zhī xíng*),
thus they **meet their fate** (*shì suǒ qīng zhī mìng*).
To **understand the mechanism of theft** (*míng hū dào qí jī*),
then the people will be **at peace** and the state **prosper**.

The **blind** excel in hearing,
the **deaf** excel in sight.
If one’s **intent** (*yòng zhì*) is **not divided** (*bù fēn*),
then it **unites with the spirit** (*yǔ shén wéi yī*).
Though the blind cannot see,
their hearing **gathers much knowledge** (*duō wén*),
why must they **rely on their eyes** (*dá bì yòng mù*)?
Though the deaf cannot hear,
their sight **gathers much perception** (*duō jiàn*),
why must they **rely on their ears** (*dá bì yòng ěr*)?
Ears can **make one discerning** (*cōng rén*),
but also **make one deaf**;
eyes can **make one enlightened** (*míng rén*),
but also **make one blind**.
The **sage** does not **use vision and hearing through ears and eyes** (*shèng rén shì tīng bì yòng ěr mù*),
thus their **discernment and enlightenment** grow ever broader.
The **common folk** must **use vision and hearing through ears and eyes** (*zhòng rén shì tīng bì yòng ěr mù*),
even if they possess them—
how are they different from the **deaf and blind**?
Is it not so that the **spirit’s dwelling** (*shén zhī yù*) lies
not **within the ears and eyes** (*fú zài ěr mù*)?

To **cut off one source of profit** (*jué lì yī yuán*),
one **can employ ten times the troops** (*shì yòng shī shí bèi*).
To **reverse the fortunes of day and night three times** (*sān fǎn zhòu yè*),
one **can employ ten thousand times the troops** (*shì yòng shī wàn bèi*).
Even **feasting and eating** must **bring disputes** (*yǐn shí bì yǒu chǎo*),
hence one **receives them with disputes** (*shòu zhī yǐ chǎo*).
Disputes must **arise from the masses** (*chǎo bì yóu zhòng qǐ*),
hence one **receives them with the troops** (*shòu zhī yǐ shī*).
When the **troops are raised** (*shī zhī xīng*),
it is **due to disputes**.
When **disputes arise** (*chǎo zhī zuò*),
it is **due to feasting and eating**.
Feasting and eating are **trivial matters** (*xiǎo yì*),
yet the **troops are truly rooted in these**.

What of **greater profits**?
The **sage** does not **repeat the raising of troops** (*bù chóng xīng shī*),
but **prizes greed for profit** (*zhòng tān lì*).
If one truly **cuts off one source of profit**,
and **prevents myriad openings and flaws** (*qiān máo wàn kǒng bù zuò*),
then their **accumulation grows ever deeper** (*suǒ jī yì hòu*).
How could the people **not be at peace**?
How could the state **not prosper**?

To **employ the troops in this manner** (*yǐ cǐ yòng shī*),
one **can use ten as one hundred**,
one hundred as one thousand,
one thousand as ten thousand—
hence it is said: **"ten times the force."**
This **Dao**—
if one **knows it** yet **cannot practice it**,
if one **practices it** yet **cannot uphold it firmly** (*bù néng shǒu zhī gù*),
but if one **practices it with sincerity** (*dù*),
and **holds fast to it resolutely** (*shǒu zhī gù*),
then even if **day and night are reversed three times** (*zhòu yè jiān sān fǎn*),
they **will not perish** (*bù dài*).
Then again, this would be **ten thousand times the force** in employing troops—
why **exhaust my people** and **drain my wealth** (*liáo wú zhī mín jié wú zhī cái*),
to **take others’ profit as my own** (*qǔ bǐ zhī lì wéi wǒ zhī lì*)?

「The Way is naturally without armies yet strong,
without battle yet victorious.
The mind arises from things and perishes with things—
its mechanism lies in the eyes.
The Sage sees the Dao yet not things,
so his mind never arises, never perishes;
The common folk see things yet not the Dao,
so their minds arise from things and perish with things.

The Sage rules heaven and earth with his fingers and palms,
guides the ten thousand transformations within his mind—
all through the movement of spirit and the workings of the heart,
thus he can receive things as effortlessly as market transactions,
his heart as still as water,
when the true mechanism unfolds,
he is not deceived by things.

But men differ from this:
they see what they desire and their minds are unsettled,
their mechanisms are shallow indeed.

Heaven, though lacking favor, gives rise to great favor.
Swift thunder and violent winds—
none escape its influence.
The four seasons proceed in their own order,
yin and yang create in their own way—
Heaven acts without doing yet accomplishes all things.
When things arise, flourish, decline, or perish,
it is by their own nature,
what favor does Heaven bestow?
Because Heaven lacks favor,
no thing can harm it—
this is the true source of its great favor.

Yet even so,
things cannot generate themselves;
they must await something.
Thunder stirs them, wind moves them—
all respond in unison.

The utmost joy lies in the nature’s ease,
the utmost stillness is pure and untainted.
Does the world have such great joy?
All things are complete within me—
returning to sincerity within oneself,
no joy surpasses this—
for within the divisions of nature,
it is said: "I do not depend on the external."

The world’s restless pursuers,
when they see something,
generate covetous hearts;
when they find joy,
generate exultant hearts.
But the Perfect One’s joy differs from this—
thus it is called *nature’s ease*.

Fortune and misfortune,
regret and blame,
arise from movement.
Movement cannot be free of entanglement—
how can it be pure?
The Perfect One dwells in steadfast stillness,
where nothing can be used or not used—
what entanglements remain?
Thus it is said:
Great purity knows no entanglement,
unless one attains utmost stillness,
how can this be achieved?

Heaven’s utmost particularity
manifests as utmost universality.
Great artifice does not serve things—
all things are complete,
clouds move and rain falls,
thunder roars and wind flies—
does it have a heart?
When things are allowed to thrive and flourish,
it is called *virtue*—
thus it is said:
Universality and particularity,
the virtue of heaven and earth.
Those that fly or run,
those that move or rest,
all take their own course.
All things say: "Heaven favors me,"
granting me this existence—
does Heaven carve and shape things?
This is called *utmost universality*.

The nature of birds is determined by *qi*.
Water and fire have their own checks and balances,
yet no extinguishing power—
it is the *qi* that responds,
naturally so, without intention.

To check one form with another,
great and small are not in harmony,
so the great always prevail,
the small always falter.
The tortoise devours the python,
the flying squirrel severs the monkey—
is it by form alone?
It is the *qi* that submits.

Life is the root of death,
death is the root of life.
What lives here may not die there,
what dies there may not live here.
The Perfect One transcends the realm of existence and non-existence,
leaving behind the domains of movement and stillness—
so life brings no delight,
death brings no revulsion—
what bonds or entanglements remain?

Roots are like a tree’s roots:
spring and summer come first,
and it flourishes;
autumn and winter come last,
and it withers.
But if you call it the root and trunk,
then there is neither life nor death.

Man is ensnared by form,
entangled by numbers—
also like a tree’s roots.
Favor arises from harm,
harm arises from favor.
Heaven and Earth are not kind—
they treat all things as fodder for the gods;
The Sage is not kind—
he treats the people as fodder for the gods.
True kindness is the very reason for not being kind—
only Heaven, Earth, and the Sage are thus,
not the narrow, private granting or withholding of power.

Yet Heaven’s domain is not yet divided,
the Sage’s presence not yet revealed—
what of kindness or unkindness?
Kindness and unkindness
are merely observed from things.

The foolish man calls Heaven and Earth’s patterns and principles *sage*,
I say the patterns and principles of time and things are *wise*.
Common and ignorant,
they lack true understanding—
they follow yin and yang,
are enslaved by creation.
They see only the dazzling changes of Heaven and Earth,
and the clear, orderly principles of Heaven and Earth.
Dim and obscured,
they do not know what sustains them—
thus they call Heaven and Earth’s patterns and principles *sage*.

But the Perfect One differs:
the movement of time is endless,
yet I follow it without resistance;
things generate without end,
yet I align with them without opposition.
Their interplay creates patterns,
their interweaving creates principles—
thus it is said:
I call the patterns and principles of time and things *wise*.」
