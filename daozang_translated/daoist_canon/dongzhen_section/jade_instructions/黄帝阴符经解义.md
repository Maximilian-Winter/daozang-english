**Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing* with Explanations**
By Xiao Zhenzai, Assistant Instructor of Kai Prefecture

**Chapter: The Daoist Immortals Embrace Unity and Manifest the Way**

To observe the Dao of Heaven, to grasp Heaven’s actions—this is complete.
Heaven has five thieves; those who perceive them flourish.
The five thieves dwell within the heart, yet their effects manifest in Heaven.

The cosmos lies within the hand; myriad transformations arise from the body.
Heaven’s nature is humanity.
Humanity’s heart is the mechanism.

Establish the Dao of Heaven to stabilize humanity.
When Heaven unleashes its killing intent, stars shift their lodges.
When Earth unleashes its killing intent, dragons and serpents ascend the land.
When humanity unleashes its killing intent, Heaven and Earth are overturned.
When Heaven and humanity jointly unleash their killing intent, all changes find their foundation.

Nature has skill and clumsiness; it can be subdued or concealed.
The nine orifices’ malevolence lies in the three critical points, which can be controlled through motion and stillness.

Fire is born from wood; when calamity arises, it must be overcome.
Deceit is born from the state; when opportunity moves, it must collapse.
To know these principles and refine them is to be called a Sage.

Heaven creates both fortune and misfortune—this is the Dao’s logic.

(*Commentary omitted*)

**Chapter: Manifesting the Law to Enrich the State and Calm the People**

Heaven and Earth are thieves of all things;
All things are thieves of humanity;
Humanity is the thief of all things.

When the three thieves are balanced, the Three Powers are harmonized.
Explanation: Those who take without need harm their virtue; those who take what is not theirs are thieves.
When one’s resolve moves yet falters, when one sees beauty yet covets what is not rightfully theirs—
if there is no deficiency or excess, it is envy;
if wisdom is lacking, it is deceit;
if wealth is lacking, it is theft.
Who can blame the thief when such actions are committed—
those who open lockboxes, probe pouches, or plunder treasuries?

*The Liezi* states:
Those who distinguish between public and private are also thieves;
Those who do not distinguish between public and private are also thieves.
Heaven, Earth, and all things do not exist in separation;
To hoard and possess is to be deluded.

Indeed, none lack life—
life begets life, yet never ceases;
none lack form—
form begets form, yet never lacks sound.

The sound has never been the source of color,
The color has never revealed the taste,
The taste has never been complete—
all are the functions of the **Wuwei** (無為, non-action).

Yin and Yang illuminate each other,
cover each other,
and regulate each other;
the four seasons succeed one another,
giving life and taking it away.
The Five Phases (五行) alternately ascend, decline, and transform one another—
yet who commands them to harmonize, to emerge and vanish,
to darken and brighten,
to be sweet or bitter,
to be rank or fragrant?
Then Heaven and Earth are the greatest thieves of all things;
humanity does not yet rely on things,
yet Heaven and Earth steal publicly from all things.

The tally of things does not end at ten thousand;
they are numbered and named by their abundance.
What makes humanity precious is its status as the **ling** (靈, spirit) of things.
It moves with the times, yet possesses all things within itself;
it does not possess all things, yet all things serve it.
It is nourished by life to sustain its existence,
and follows death to find its resting place—
then all things are humanity’s thieves,
though humanity differs from things,
yet all things steal publicly from humanity.

Master Dongguo (東郭) said:
If one body is not a thief, what then?
It steals the harmony of Yin and Yang to complete its life,
to bear its form—
how much more so with external things, which are not thieves?

When it comes to stealing the **pángrùn** (滂潤, abundant nourishment) of clouds and rain,
the **chányù** (産育, nurturing) of mountains and marshes,
it follows their emergence and decline,
adapts to their waxing and waning,
accepts their evenness and fullness,
exploits their concealment and storage—
from the six transformations (六化) it derives the causes of triumph, decay, excess, deficiency, emptiness, and fullness;
from the six changes (六變) it discerns the flavors of sweet, bitter, spicy, salty, sour, and bland.
It diminishes the flourishing to aid the withering,
discards the contrary to take the compliant—
using things to sustain its life,
serving things to ensure its nourishment—
then humanity is indeed the thief of all things.

Things are inherently unspiritual (不靈),
yet humanity constantly steals from them publicly—
if stealing has a **Dao** (道, Way),
when does it end?
Only when the three kinds of theft are appropriate,
then each thing finds its proper place,
and each matter follows its natural order.
In accordance with the times’ demands,
each aligns with **yì** (義, righteousness or proper function),
sometimes nourishing form to preserve life,
sometimes receiving the **zhōng** (中, vital center) to establish one’s fate.

Those who perceive this yet remain unaware are dividing Yin and Yang within **one virtue** (一德);
Those who understand this yet distinguish are dividing Yin and Yang within **two principles** (兩儀).
Thus, one can merge the **three talents** (三才, Heaven, Earth, Humanity) of the Dao,
penetrate the **three extremes** (三极, the utmost limits of Yin, Yang, and their interaction),
and let Heaven, Earth, and Humanity each attain their Dao,
resting in their proper states—
is this not the true thief?

The **Laozi** (老君, Master Lao) speaks of those with surplus wealth as thieves,
but is this not a distortion of the Dao?
They covet fleeting glory,
boast of superficial adornments—
how could they know that those who practice the Dao have deep roots and firm foundations,
their use endless?

Between Heaven and Earth,
no bandit is greater than the thief of Yin and Yang.
The *Yīnfú* (《阴符》) text,
when it first speaks of **zéi** (贼, bandits),
refers to the way of nurturing nature and preserving **zhēn** (真, authenticity).
This lies in not losing its proper measure (則).

When it next speaks of **dào** (盗, thieves),
it refers to the principle of nourishing life and adapting to change (變).
This lies in each finding its proper place (分).

So who is the bandit?
Who is not the bandit?
Yet none can escape the subtle workings of Heaven’s intent (天機之幾).
Is this not the essence of knowing the **few** (幾, critical moments)?

Students must ponder this carefully.
Thus it is said:
Eat in accordance with the seasons,
and the hundred bones (百骸) will be in harmony.
Act upon the **jī** (機, vital opportunities),
and the myriad transformations (万化) will be at peace.
Humans know the **shén** (神, spirit) when it is spirit,
yet do not know when it is not spirit—
the means by which it becomes spirit.

The **Master** (解) explains:
The **ancient Perfect Ones** (古之至人) shared in the nourishment of Earth,
and took delight in the harmony of Heaven,
without letting the gain or loss of things harm them.
They did not scheme against one another,
nor did they plot as bandits or strategize for advantage,
but came and went in ease and simplicity—
this is called the **jīng** (經, classic) of **wèishēng** (衛生, health preservation).

If one does not conform to this,
the **heavenly balance** (天鈞) will enslave them,
yet not even this can fully subdue them.
Much less can they be bound by Heaven and Earth’s scattered **jīng** (精, essence),
the equal distribution of movement and growth,
the **qi** (氣) and flavors that nourish and enrich—
for no thing lacks these.

Heaven nourishes humanity with the **Five Qi** (五炁),
storing them within the heart and lungs,
thus making voice and color vivid and clear;
Earth nourishes humanity with the **Five Flavors** (五味),
dispersing them to nourish the **Five Palaces** (五宮),
so that **qi** and flavors harmonize
and spirit arises naturally.

Food and drink are the common way,
yet the most vital principle of **wèishēng** (health preservation)
lies in nothing but attuning to the **Yin-Yang balance**.

The spleen and stomach depend upon them to fill the granaries,
the **San Jiao** (三焦) rely on them to open the pathways,
the **honor-guard and defense circuits** (荣卫) depend on them for clarity and turbidity,
the sinews and bones rely on them for flexibility and rectitude—
thus, in spring, one should favor **sour**,
in summer, **bitter**,
in autumn, **pungent**,
in winter, **salty**—
this is called *"adjusting according to the season"* (因其时而调之).

Hence it is said: *"Eat in season"* (食其时).

In spring, when Wood reigns, use **greasy and fragrant** foods to assist the spleen;
in summer, when Fire reigns, use **greasy and restless** foods to assist the lungs;
when Metal is active, use **greasy and gamey** foods to assist the liver;
when Water prevails, use **greasy and fatty** foods to assist the heart—
this is called *"aiding what is not yet overbearing"* (因其不胜以助之).

As the **child-mother cycle** follows the **Dao of mutual generation** (相生之道),
so too do the **qi** seek their counterparts;
as **husband and wife** follow the **Dao of mutual nourishment** (相养之道),
so too do they **restrain and regulate** one another.

Neither excess nor deficiency—
all the body’s tangible forms,
no matter how minute,
conform to the principles of **Nature**.

Nourish the **Yang** through food,
move and rest according to the seasons,
abundantly source the origin while conserving expenditure,
restore the root to solidify existence,
inhale the fresh and exhale the stale to refine the stores,
focus the mind to accumulate essence and attune the spirit,
balance **swelling and emptiness** to assist **Nature’s rhythms**,
preserve the **harmonious equilibrium** (委和),
align with the **Great Harmony** (太和),
without deviation in near or far,
silently revolving within the **circular flow** (环中),
trusting the **spontaneous response of the numinous mechanism** (灵机),
never entering the **impassable**,
transforming into the **formless transformation**—
the common folk are all drawn to its ears and eyes,
the sages all cherish it like a child—
who could fail to find ease in the **essence of life and fate**?

Hence it is said: *"Stimulate the mechanism, and all transformations settle"* (动其机，万化安).

Humans know the **spirit** and thus become **spirit**,
yet they do not know the **non-spirit** that makes **spirit** possible.

The **unfathomable** nature of **Yin-Yang** is what we call **spirit**,
and **spirit** is the subtle articulation of all things.

**Spirit** transforms and adapts them,
making them suitable for humanity,
without overfamiliarity with their dwelling,
without weariness of their sustenance—
humans know **spirit** and thus become **spirit**.

Yet when it is **square without cutting**,
**bright without dazzling**,
when giving to others only increases what one possesses,
when sharing only multiplies what one has—
when it makes the people relish their food,
admire their attire,
find comfort in their customs,
and joy in their labors—
how could this not be the **non-spirit** that makes **spirit** possible?

I have often examined the closing passages of the *Analects* and the *Mencius*,
both of which speak of the **sagely deeds** of **Emperor Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang**,
as if to say: *"Apply this book to governance,
and its effects will be as great as theirs."*

The **Yellow Emperor**, the most **sage-spirited** of the Five Emperors,
whose ministers none could surpass,
recorded his teachings in writing,
uniquely clarifying the **Dao of virtue and power** (道德之意)
and the **origin of reason** (理性之原),
gathering the scattered affairs of things
and returning them to the **purity of ancient simplicity** (淳朴、太古之风).

To apply his book to governance
is to **respond with reciprocity** (酬酢),
to **assist the spirit** (佑神),
so that the people become **unadulterated** (淳淳),
and one might ask: *"What more could the Emperor’s power add?"*
Is this not the effect of his book?

Carefully reading the **Imperially Authored *Holy Aid*** (御制圣济),
its **preface** begins with **embodying the True** (体真)
and ends with **verifying the prescription** (审剂);
its **chapters** begin with **Yin-Yang in balance** (阴阳适平)
and end with **harmon

To **fathom the nature** (尽性) is to **manifest the good and dispel the evil** (彰善瘴恶), clearly revealing the **principles of right and wrong** (好恶) so that all may **walk in benevolence and tread in righteousness** (履仁而蹈义).

If one **harbors hidden schemes** (虞机) and **sets them in motion** (张), they will **strike true when revealed** (发而必中). This so-called **true scheme** (真机)—I know not whose child it is—is what the *Book of Changes* refers to when it says: *"The Way of the Emperors precedes this; it is something the world cannot see, cannot know."*

When **embryonic vitality** (萌) is **contained** (拥) before its **manifestation** (判), and when **the myriad sources** (万源) are **blocked** (塞) at their **origin** (机上), then **abandoning life for the True** (舍生反真), **discerning categories to store evil** (触类藏邪), while **human artifice** (人伪) has not yet **intervened** (交), one may **remain unrestrained and harmonious** (冲融不丧).

When the **Five Phases** (五行) **clash destructively** (杀害) and the **Four Seasons** (四节) **shift in conflict** (交掷), when **Metal and Earth** (金土) **align in affinity** (相亲) and **Water and Fire** (水火) **counterattack** (相射), when **great floods and lightning** (洪电) **rage across** (纵横) and **thunder shakes east and west** (雷震东西), then **the True of Heaven** (天真) is revealed.

It **transforms into the calamity of Nine-in-Heaven** (化为阳九之灾), and **the Earth’s blockage** (地否) is **impeded** (阂矣). Then comes the **gathering of One Hundred and Six** (乃为百六之会), where **fortune and misfortune collide** (吉凶互冲), and **all portend disaster and calamity** (众示灾咎). For those who **walk the smooth Dao** (履坦道者), the **recluse finds true fortune** (幽人正吉); for those who **avoid excess and retreat** (居肥遁者), **no journey is without advantage** (无往不利).

If one **dares to ascend** (冒崄) and **collapses into ruin** (墟也), then **movement is certain** (行必舆); if one **lies in wait like a corpse** (尸涉) in the **northeast**, then **one loses friends and regrets past actions** (丧朋悔亡). Yet how can the world **see** (见) this? How can one **raise their vision** (高其目) to perceive what is unseen?

Human life is **like a fleeting illusion** (如幻化), a **sojourn in Heaven and Earth** (寄寓天地间), a **temporary gathering of qi** (暂聚炁耳). If one **nourishes the spirit and anchors in the True** (营神注真), then they **abide with Heaven and Earth in the Great Void** (与天地共寓在大无中矣). If one **penetrates emptiness and embodies the Primordial** (洞虚体元), then they **share in the Great Void’s stillness** (与大无共寄在寂寂中矣).

Yet how can the world **know** (知) this? How can one **distinguish in things and command in things** (辨於物而命於物) when none can?

**Shackled by emotional entanglements** (桎梏於情累), **pleased to submit to the tiger’s jaws** (甘心於虎口), they are like **grasping a torch to walk against the wind** (执炬火以行逆风), foolishly unrelenting until **their hands are burned** (终必焚手). **Greed and desire kindle internal strife** (贪欲柴内), and **harmony is consumed** (终必焚和). Only the **Sage** (圣人) can **see what none can see, know what none can know** (见所莫能见，知所莫能知). The **Noble** (君子) who attains this **remains steadfast in adversity** (得之则固穷), for **adversity brings change** (穷则变), **change leads to understanding** (变则通), and **understanding ensures longevity** (通则久).

Though they **lack a destination** (无所之) yet **emerge with certainty** (允以出), how could they **fail to reach anywhere** (则何所不之哉)? Though they **restrain their body** (艮其身) and **halt at their own limits** (止诸躬), how could they **fail to extend their influence** (则何所不申哉)? The *Book of Changes* says: *"Things cannot be exhausted by mere inquiry; the Noble can **fix them firmly** (固之)."* From this inquiry of **principles** (穷理), from this inquiry of **spirit** (穷神), then **none can exhaust their depths** (莫知其穷).

The **petty person** (小人) who attains this **recklessly risks their life** (轻命), for they **do not know Heaven’s command** (不知天命) and **do not fear it** (不畏). They **waste their lives and harm their nature** (残生伤性), **cling like parasitic growths** (附赘垂疣), and **nothing is beyond their reach** (无所不至). Heaven’s **decree of wisdom** (命哲) and **decree of fortune and misfortune** (命吉凶) are profound. Moreover, **heavy burdens** (重) become **light roots** (轻根), and these cannot be **neglected** (忽).

No **calamity is greater than desire** (咎莫大於欲), no **disaster comes from ignorance of contentment** (得祸莫大於不知足). Would the **Sage** (圣人) **lightly risk their life for the world** (以身轻天下)? The *Comprehensive Treatise of the Five Ranges* (洪范□九畴) fully records the **Dao of Five Blessings and Six Calamities** (五福六极之道), to **illustrate the signs of fortune and misfortune** (明休咎之证). It **stresses the weight of their duties** (重其任) while **punishments do not exceed limits** (罚不胜), it **distances their paths** (远其涂) while **executions are not severe** (诛不至). It **sets the limit of no limit** (刑期无刑) to **align with moderation** (协于中), it **gathers at the extreme** (会其有极) to **return to the extreme** (归有极), all to **cherish human life** (重民命).

**Laozi** says: *"My words are easy to know, easy to practice, yet the world cannot know them, cannot practice them—because they are **so insipid as to lack flavor** (淡乎其无味)."* Those who can **remove the extremes** (去甚), **avoid excess** (去奢), and **reject extravagance** (去泰) are the **Noble** who can **fix adversity** (固穷).

If the multitude **rejoices in confusion** (熙熙), **feasting as if at a grand sacrificial banquet** (如享太牢), **climbing to the Spring Platform** (如登春台), yet **do not understand principles** (不明乎理), **chasing things to generate attachments** (逐物生情) and **never returning** (终身不返), how can they **know that what they fear should not be feared** (安知所谓人之所畏不可不畏)?

Those who **stand at the edge of calamity** (临畏涂) yet **do not take heed** (不知戒) are all **those who risk their lives** (轻命). Thus, the **Noble and petty are distinguished** (君子小人辨矣).

The **Sage knows the harm of heartcraft** (圣人知心术之为患), so they **unmask the deception of the dream deer** (辨梦鹿之蔽), **awaken from the loss of forgetting** (觉病忘之失), and **resolve the confusion of delusion** (解迷罔之疾). They **deceived the people of Jin** (诳晋国之城) and **concealed the sorrow of Yan** (微燕国之悲), all to **open the minds of the ignorant** (启蒙) and **bewilder the world for future generations** (惑於天下后世).

**The Chapter of Martial Strategy and Victory** (强兵战胜演术章)
**The Blind excel in hearing** (瞽者善听), **the Deaf excel in sight** (聋者善视). **Cutting off one source of profit** (绝利一源) makes **the army ten times more effective** (用师十倍); **three reversals of day and night** (三反昼夜) make **the army a hundred thousand times more effective** (用师万倍).

**Explanation:** In ancient times, **Duke Huan of Lu** (鲁侯) heard of **Gang Cangzi** (亢仓子) who could **see with his ears and hear with his eyes** (以耳视而目听), so he sent **rich gifts** (厚礼) to summon him and **humbly asked** (卑辞请问). Gang Cangzi replied: *"This was **a false transmission** (妄). I can **see and hear without relying on ears and eyes** (视听不用耳目), but how could I **exchange the use of ears and eyes** (易耳目之用)?"*

This is why it says: *"The Blind excel in hearing, the Deaf excel in sight*—this is **the *Book of Changes*’s application** (易所用矣). The **ancient kings** (先王) **employed people without discarding their talents** (无弃才), appointing **the Deaf to oversee fire** (司火以聋) and **the Blind to oversee music** (司乐以瞽)—this is **the *Book of Changes*’s application** (易所用也).

**Deafness** (聋) is **favor** (宠). When the **ears are favored** (有所宠), they become **deaf** (聋矣). **Blindness** (瞽) is **excessive stimulation** (鼓). When the **eyes are overjoyed** (有所乐), they become **blind** (瞽矣). Thus, those who can **focus their stillness** (专静) and **attain singularity** (致一) without distraction **advance in their skill** (进乎其技).

Like **the merchant of Shicheng** (市南) **juggling multiple balls** (之累丸), or **the hunched man** (痀偻) **mimicking cicadas** (之承蜩), or **removing the whitewash from the tip of the nose** (去垩於鼻端), or **playing the knife between the joints of an ox** (游刃於解牛), all these rely on **a concentrated will** (用志不分), and only then can they **achieve their goals** (有所致).

Those who **hide among thieves and bandits** (寓形於盗贼之间), **suffering from one-sided afflictions** (困於偏伤之患), have **a will directed elsewhere** (志有所适). Though they **grasp one thing while missing another** (一该一曲), they still **find some place in the world** (不无所容於世).

But when **qi converges in the heart** (炁合於心) and **spirit merges with qi** (神合於炁), then **they do not rely on ears and eyes** (不用於耳目), nor are they **constrained by afflictions** (困於患). **Locusts swarm in flight yet do not touch** (焦螟群飞而弗触); one who **wipes their eyes by day** (昼拭目者) **sees no form** (望之弗见其形); **mosquitoes nest in the eyelashes yet are not felt** (蚊睫栖宿而弗觉).

At night, one who **bows their head** (俛首) **hears no sound** (听之弗闻其声). Yet **the Yellow Emperor** (黄帝), **slowly gazing with his spirit** (徐以神视), **perceives them as solid and clear** (块然见之), like **the curve of Mount Song** (若嵩山之阿); **slowly listening with his qi** (徐以炁听), **hears them with thunderous resonance** (砰然闻之), like **the voice of thunderous lightning** (若雷霆之声).

This is **to see clearly in the dark** (见晓於冥冥) and **to hear harmony in silence** (闻和於无声), **dismissing their sharp senses** (黜其聪明) yet **unadorned by form** (亦无丽於形).

The **origin of ears and eyes** (耳目之原) **rests in Water and Fire** (本乎水火). When **Heaven is One** (天一) and **Earth is Two** (地二), **Water’s clarity** (水精) and **Fire’s spirit** (火神) **pierce through** (神彻), then they become **keen and bright** (聪明); when **material obstructions** (物蔽) **cloud them**, then they become **deaf and blind** (聋瞽).

「When the **essence** (精) is **fully exhausted** in the ears, the **spirit** (神) gathers and **reflects upon it**; having **fully drained** the eyes’ strength (竭目力焉).
When the **essence** merges with the **spirit**, vision becomes **boundless in its application** (视之不可胜用也).

When the **spirit** is **fully exhausted** in the eyes, the **essence** gathers and **reflects upon it**; having **fully drained** the ears’ strength (竭耳力焉).
When the **spirit** is **concealed within the essence**, hearing becomes **boundless in its application** (听之不可胜用也).

Where harm reaches, benefit follows; where evil arises, goodness ensues.
Is this not **to cultivate what is good** (善其所善)?
For **to nurture life is to prepare for death** (善吾生者乃所以善吾死).
This refers to **good hearing and good vision persisting**, thus **cutting off the single source of benefit** (绝利一源),
and **employing the Way tenfold** (用师十倍);
**three reversals of day and night** (三反昼夜), **employing the Way a thousandfold** (用师万倍).
It cannot be sought through **form and trace** (形迹).

I secretly hold that the **Five Bandits** (五贼) and **Three Thieves** (三盗) all emerge from **one source** (一源),
just as the **Yellow River** (河) unites yet branches into **nine tributaries** (九),
and the **Dao/Way** (道) is singular yet gives rise to **ten thousand things** (万).
Like **Water’s boundless benefit to all things** (水之善利万物),
or **the Supreme Virtue’s (乾) beautiful utility for all under Heaven** (美利天下),
thus knowing that **before transformation, there is natural order** (未有化), **and after, there is regulation** (裁之有制).
Transform and regulate it, and its **benefits are limitless** (其利无穷矣).

The **mechanisms of Heaven and Earth** (天地万物之机),
the **convergences of the hundred bones and nine orifices** (百骸九窍之会),
the **principle of correct and odd military strategy** (用兵正奇之本),
and the **cycles of the Five Phases and Six Children** (五行六子之运),
all arise from this and **cannot escape it** (无所逃也).
When **the Way’s application is perfected in the heart** (用师其成心),
it is the **origin of the sage-kings** (圣王之所原).

Those who **embody the standard for all under Heaven** (抱之为天下式者),
**govern themselves with the true Dao** (以道之真治其身),
and **universalize true virtue** (以德之真普天下).
When **applied to all things** (举之於事物之上),
it **responds to Heaven’s changes** (应天下之变),
**aligns with Heaven’s movements** (顺天下之动),
and **carries the square-inch seal** (佩方寸之印),
**commanding a millionfold army** (提百万之师).
All these are **convergences of the mechanism** (投机之会),
**achieving tenfold success** (收十倍之成功).

From this **pivot of the Three Thieves and Three Talents** (三盗三才之要),
**one reversal and one return** (一反一复),
**one day and one night** (一昼一夜),
**endlessly traversing between Heaven and Earth** (往来不穷於天地之间),
**existing yet perishing, beginning yet ending** (存存而亡亡，始始而终终),
**rooted in Yang yet returning in Yin below** (本乎阳而反复乎下),
**rooted in Yin yet returning in Yang above** (本乎阴而反复乎上).
**The past is reversal** (往者，反也).
**The future is return** (来者，复也).
Thus, **the convergence of mechanisms** (机之所会),
**perfecting the Way’s application** (用师其成心),
**embracing the luminous ten thousand forms** (含光万象),
**transforming and adapting to all existence** (化贷万有),
**enclosing all shapes within secrecy** (密囿万形),
**gathering all goodness into unity** (并包万善),
**lifting and placing them with ease** (举而措之),
**secures ten thousandfold complete success** (收万倍之全功).

Just as the **Dao of the Supreme Transformation** (太易之道) exists **above the Six Extremes** (在六极之上) yet is **not high**,
and **below the Six Extremes** (在六极之下) yet is **not deep**,
the **Eight Trigrams** (八卦) **alternately apply softness and hardness** (迭用柔刚) within **the cycles of concealment and revelation** (覆焘之中),
and **no one knows their ultimate principle** (莫知其极).
Who **commands this** (孰使之也)?
All that **makes form** (所以使形者),
who **is it** (其谁欤)?

I have observed **Sunzi’s** (孙子) **masterful discourse on warfare** (善论兵),
and likened it to **the serpent of Mount Long** (率然).
**The serpent of Mount Long** (率然者，常山之蛇也),
**when struck at the head, the tail arrives** (击首则尾至),
**when struck at the tail, the head arrives** (击尾则首至),
**when struck at its center, both head and tail arrive** (击其中则首尾皆至).
Truly, there is **a means to command it** (果有以使之也).
Understanding this, **the mechanisms of tenfold and thousandfold success** (十倍万倍),
**one source and three reversals** (一源三反) can now be discerned.

The **heart arises from things** (心生於物),
**dies from things** (死於物),
and **its mechanism lies in the eyes** (机在目).

**Explanation:** *Mencius* says:
**"The heart of compassion** (恻隐之心) is the **beginning of virtue** (仁之端也);
**the heart of shame and dislike** (羞恶之心) is the **beginning of righteousness** (义之端也);
**the heart of modesty and yielding** (辞逊之心) is the **beginning of propriety** (礼之端也);
**the heart of right and wrong** (是非之心) is the **beginning of wisdom** (智之端也)."
**Virtue, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom** (仁义礼智) **root in the heart** (根於心),
and the **heart** (心者),
**is the master of the five senses** (五官之所主),
**the foundation of spirit, soul, and vital essence** (精神魂魄之所依),
from which **joy, anger, sorrow, delight, love, hatred, and desire** (喜、怒、哀、乐、爱、恶、欲) **naturally emerge** (自生焉).

**All laws** (万法) **originate from here** (所自起),
**all phenomena are extinguished here** (万象所自灭).
When **lodged in the spirit**, it **spans all directions** (寄於神则经纬万方);
when **dwelling in the Dao**, it **is singular and pure** (寓於道则惟精惟一).
The **sage cultivates the heart to merge with qi** (以心合炁),
**and cultivates qi to merge with the heart** (以炁合心),
**using the heart as the vessel for spirit’s clarity** (以心为神明之含),
**and using qi as the steed for good and evil** (以炁为善恶之马).
Thus, **nurturing the heart requires few desires** (养心以寡欲),
**and nurturing the spirit requires boundless expansiveness** (养炁以浩然).

**Dissolving obstructions and delusions** (解蔽惑) **is the great calamity** (於大患),
**abandoning shackles and restraints** (捐桎梏) **occurs at dawn and dusk** (於旦暮).
**Qi is the mother of spirit** (炁为神母),
**and the heart is the master of qi** (心为炁主).
**Using qi to nourish spirit** (用炁养神),
**qi thrives as spirit generates** (炁因神生),
**spirit moves and qi moves** (神行而炁行),
**spirit rests and qi rests** (神住而炁住).
**The heart can dwell in qi** (心能住於炁),
**and qi can dwell in the heart** (炁能住於心).
**Stillness has its Way** (不动有道),
**without coming or going** (无来无去).
**Nourish it with rectitude, do not disturb it** (以直养之勿扰勿撄).

**The heart is the Way** (夫心即是道),
**and the Way is the heart** (道即是心).
**The ignorant** (昧者) **corrupt their nature in the mundane** (缮性於俗),
**chasing things without reflection** (逐物而不反),
**losing their resolve in things** (丧志於物),
**and spend their lives without awakening** (终身而莫悟).
**Delusion arises from seeing what is desired** (妄见可欲),
**and the heart becomes agitated** (心为之愤乱焉).
How can they know **the harm of the heart’s art** (心术之害)?
**Laozi says:** *Do not see what is desired, so the heart does not become agitated* (不见可欲，使心不乱).
Only **the sage knows** (唯圣人能知) that **all things transform and generate from being and non-being** (诸物化生於有无),
**yet none truly emerge from ultimate reality** (皆非出乎真实).
Thus, **all forms are viewed with singularity** (万态一视),
**and the heart holds no preference or rejection** (无取舍之心).
If so, **the heart’s realm remains even** (心境常夷),
**and how can things disturb it** (物曷能乱之)?

Therefore, **the sage does not prize hard-to-obtain wealth** (不贵难得之货),
**and makes the people without knowledge and without desire** (而使民无知无欲).
Thus, **they are born in worry and die in ease** (生於忧患，死於安乐).
*The Liezi* says:
*"In life, they pity one another; in death, they abandon one another"* (生相怜，死相捐).
Again it says:
*"The people of antiquity knew that life comes temporarily, and death departs temporarily.
Their hearts moved without resistance, and their natural inclinations flowed without obstruction.
Thus, all things were their delight"* (太古之人知生之暂来，死之暂往，
心动不违，自然所好也。
故不为名所观，性游不逆，万物所好也).
Thus, **they were not affected by punishment** (不为刑所及),
**in life, differing from wise and foolish, noble and base** (生则异於贤愚贵贱),
**in death, equal to decay and annihilation** (死则同於臭腐消灭).
From this, it can be inferred that **the mechanisms of all things’ death and life lie in the heart** (万物死生之机皆在心),
**and the mechanisms of one’s movement and stillness lie in the eyes** (一身动静之机皆在目),
**while the mechanism is triggered at the heels** (而机发於踵也).

The **Five Zang organs** (五藏) all have **their essence rooted in Kan** (精原於坎),
**unified as Yang within Yin** (一而为阴中之阳);
The **Five Zang organs** all have **their spirit rooted in Li** (神原於离),
**dual as Yin within Yang** (二而为阳中之阴).
**When essence is concealed, spirit gathers** (精潜则神集).
**Spirit within is concealed in the heart** (神在乎内则潜於心),
**and spirit revealed without manifests in the eyes** (神发乎外则见於目).
The **interaction between heart and eyes** (心目之桥运) is like
**form and sound in echoes and responses** (犹形声於影响),
**by which they correspond and command one another** (所以相应相使者).
Who **is it that does this** (其谁欤)?

The white crane’s gaze,
**the eyes move and the heart transforms** (目运而心化).
Only those who **grasp the intent beyond form and vessel** (得意於形器之表者),
**pierce the heavens with their gaze, never blinking** (锥末倒眦而不瞬),
**as if uttering a single breath: "Hū-dàn!"** (矢中目一呼旦切).
**Yet their eyelashes do not stir** (而不睫).

All under heaven **pursue what the eyes desire to see** (徇目之所欲见者),
**deeming beauty as beauty and color as color** (美之为美，色之为色矣).
But for the **eyes already lost** (目之已亡者),
**the five hues blind like the dark mountain** (五色有以盲之冥山),
**and though they turn away, they cannot see** (且背而弗见),
**how could they ever partake in the observation of ceremonial patterns** (安能预乎黼黻之观)?
Thus, the **Sage** (圣人) **strain his eyes in sorrow for the world’s afflictions** (蒿目以忧世之患).
The *Mencius* says:
**When the chest is upright, the pupils are clear** (胸中正则眸子瞭焉),
**but when the chest is not upright, the pupils grow dim** (胸中不正则眸子盹焉).
**Good and evil accumulate in the heart** (善恶之积乎心),
**while clarity and obscurity settle in the eyes** (而昏明之着乎目).
**If the spirit cannot shift them** (其神且不能移易之),
**then who can discern the mechanisms of their ebb and flow** (其机孰认乎出入也)?

The **Song people** (宋人) **practiced benevolence and righteousness for three generations** (三世好行仁义),
**with their calves bearing white markings** (犊两生白),
**a reversal of their mother’s influence** (反母之熏).
They consulted Confucius,
**and all were told of auspicious omens** (俱告以吉祥).
Yet father and son **both went blind without cause** (皆无故而继盲).
Three years later,
**only one escaped through illness** (独以疾而免).
When the **Chu siege was lifted** (楚攻围已解),
**their afflictions returned together** (而疾俱复).
Thus, **if good and evil accumulate and clarity and obscurity settle as such** (然则善恶之积，昏明之着如此),
**then only those who know the Dao can truly perceive their mechanisms** (则其机之神非知其道者能视乎)?
**If the artificer Pianshi’s creations** (若偃师之有所造也)
**could summon movement by blinking** (瞬目而有招),
**he might seize the King Mu’s axe** (立取穆王之剖矣).
**When their assembly matched the original** (其合会复如初),
**destroying the liver made the eyes cease to see** (废其肝则目不视),
**and destroying the kidneys made the feet unable to walk** (废其肾则足不行).
**Moreover, human craftsmanship mirrors the creative process** (且人之巧也，与造化同功如此),
**how much more so the natural eyes with their inherent mechanisms** (况以自然之目而有自然之机乎)?
The **Yellow Emperor’s text** (黄帝之书) says:
**The Perfect Man dwells as if dead** (至人居若死),
**and moves like a machine** (动若械).
**He does not alter his appearance for the common gaze** (不以众人之观易其情貌),
**nor does he change his appearance because the common gaze does not observe him** (不谓众人之不观不易其情貌).
**Coming and going alone** (独往独来),
**entering and exiting alone** (独出独入),
**who could hinder him** (孰能碍之)?
**Is it not because his mechanisms and eyes are both entrusted to nature** (岂非以机与目皆任之於自然)?

**Heaven’s great benevolence arises from its lack of partiality** (天之无恩而大恩生).
**Swift thunder and violent winds all move without restraint** (迅雷烈风，莫不蠢然).
It is said:
**The boundless void, Heaven’s Dao self-assembles** (窈然无际，天道自会);
**The indistinct unity, Heaven’s Dao self-operates** (漠然无分，天道自运).
**Without partiality, yet all things are private** (无私以成其私),
**without possession, yet all things arise** (无有以生於有).
**This is without intent in generation** (此无心於生),
**yet generation is inexhaustible** (生自不穷);
**without intent in transformation** (无心於化),
**yet transformation ceases not** (化自不已).
Thus, **His virtue is vast and great** (故其为德也，广矣，大矣).
**All under heaven are born in harmony** (天下诱然皆生),
**yet they do not know their source of birth** (而不知其所以生),
**all obtain in unity** (同焉皆得),
**yet they do not know their means of attainment** (而不知其所以得也).
**To bestow benevolence from the heart is small** (盖因其心而有恩者小),
**but to arise from the heartless is great** (惟出於无心则大).
**Benevolence springs from the lack of partiality** (恩生於无恩).
**Laozi says:**
**Heaven and Earth are not kind** (天地不仁),
**yet they treat all things as grass and dogs** (以万物为刍狗).
**They give life without demanding repayment** (生而不责其报),
**and work wonders without claiming credit** (妙而不有其功).
Thus, **those who model Heaven’s actions** (体天之行者),
**generate without possession** (生而不有),
**act without reliance** (为而不恃),
**benefit all ages without being called benevolent** (泽万世不为仁),
**order all things without being called righteous** (整万物不为义焉).

**When one cuts the saplings of Cow Mountain’s beauty** (迨夫伐蘗牛山之美),
**or violates the rectitude of the ceremonial vessels** (戕贼桮桊之正者),
**all harm life and wound nature** (皆残生以伤性也).
In the past, **one who released living creatures to show benevolence** (昔人放生示恩),
**when asked by a guest** (悟有客之问者),
**was not as enlightened as the words of Master Bao** (曾不如鲍子之言天地与我并生类也).
**All creatures are equal** (类无贵贱),
**yet only wisdom and strength allow them to dominate or be consumed** (徒以智力相制相食),
**not because Heaven originally created things for humans** (非天本为人生物),
**nor because Heaven created mosquitoes for humans** (为蚊蚋生人也).
**Then who is it that harms their existence** (然则有以害其生者谁欤)?

**The greatest stirrer of movement under heaven is thunder** (故鼓天下之动者莫如雷),
**the greatest transformer of movement under heaven is wind** (化天下之动者莫如风).
**Yet who is it that moves them** (然则有以动之者其谁欤)?
**For all Yang forces emerge and converge to form thunder** (且众阳出而围之相薄以成雷),
**only when swift strikes ascend do they become beneficial rain** (惟迅击而上达，则利而为雨).
**From the hour of Zi to Mao** (自子至卯),
**riding the four Yang forces before they sound** (乘四阳而后发声),
**the Emperor emerges from the East** (方帝出乎震也).
**Movement must align with its time** (动必以时),
**thus the bent straightens** (是以屈者斯申),
**and the low rises** (垫者斯起),
**all awaiting the swift** (必待於迅者).
**Even when one force is concentrated and ascends** (盖致一而上通),
**it still requires the aid of the second** (尚或乙之),
**but only the swift can fully express its nature** (惟迅乃得达其情也).

**The Great Mass sighs, its essence from Heaven’s work** (大块噫炁，本乎天作).
**All movement has something to await** (凡动皆有所待),
**all creatures transform through their connections** (凡虫皆因而化).
**The first calls out: "Yī!"** (前者唱于)
**The following responds: "Yú!"** (随者唱喁);

When the **Great Mass** acts, ten thousand apertures roar in fury,
its winds blow in myriad variations—
until they settle, then they align with **Xun**,
moving to wield their power.

Thus, the armored cracks,
the withered flourishes—
all await the **Fierce One**.

For fire’s fury holds the **Divine Essence**,
from which **rites** emerge.

As for **Spring**, the time of movement born of **Yang**,
life is born through **wind’s transformation**,
and those attuned to the season surge with **thunder’s might**—
thus all things are said to stir in unison.

Yet who knows the **why** behind **thunder** and **wind**?
The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"What stirs all things but **thunder** and **wind**?
What rouses the people but **proclamations** and **commands**?"*

The **Sage’s governance**—
life and death, bestowal and deprivation—
holds great **virtue**,
while rewards, punishments, and **public justice** achieve great **equity**—
yet how could the **Sage** harbor **intent** in such matters?
All is their own **retribution**.

**Supreme joy** leaves **nature’s residue**,
**supreme stillness** brings **clarity**.

The **Explication** says:
*"Heaven and Earth as one finger,
all things as one horse—
who sets the boundaries?
Who judges right and wrong?
Is there truly **gain** and **loss** at all?"*

「Thus the Master Zhāo’s playing of the *qin*—
could there truly be **gain** and **loss**?

Thus the Master Zhāo’s not playing of the *qin*—
**Supreme joy** is without joy, **true nature** is without nature.

Joy brings **life**, and **life**—
how could it be otherwise?
Once **life** arises,
nature follows,
and nature brings **emptiness**.

What emerges from within is inherently **still**, what comes from without is inherently **void**.
To find joy in **Heaven** and reach **knowing of one’s fate**,
to exhaust **principles** and reach **fulfillment of nature**—
then a single finger, a single horse,
are without excess or deficiency;
the duck’s flight short, the crane’s long,
yet neither is severed nor continuous.

From one **nature** to extend to all **natures**,
sufficient without lack,
surplus without seeking—
Laozi says:
*"The Sage has no accumulation.*
The more one gives to others, the more one has for oneself;
the more one lends to others, the more one possesses.
Taking does not exhaust, giving does not deplete—
yet surplus comes from its own surplus.
This is called **Supreme joy** without remainder."

**Nature** has its own fixed course;
**stillness** brings **clarity**.
Not stirring with things yet moving,
not seizing motion yet contending—
**cosmic harmony** manifests from **Heaven’s light**,
**purity** arises from the **empty chamber**;
distinguishing the division of **inner** and **outer**,
settling the realm of **honor** and **humiliation**—
**vision** encompasses all without violating its limits,
**allocation** has boundaries without encroaching upon its domain—
**stillness** thus achieves **equanimity**.
*Zhuangzi* says:
*"Equanimity is the fullness of water at rest;
equanimity means each thing finds its own place.*
And again:
*"When the mind is **still**, it mirrors **Heaven** and **Earth**;
when it mirrors, it guards its own domain,
and **clarity** emerges from its own **clarity**.*
This is called **Supreme stillness** bringing **clarity**."

To exhaust **nature** and return to **root**,
to reverse to **One** and restore **fate**—
the Sage attains this,
thus **clearing and stillness** become the **rectification** for all under **Heaven**.
**Heaven’s** utmost **privacy**,
its **application** most **public**—
**Explication** says:
*"Why does **Heaven’s Dao** say ‘without privacy’ yet call it ‘utmost privacy’?
Do not **deify** **Heaven**.
Its **operation** is without accumulation;
it **envelops** the earth below,
nurtures all **life**—
thus the teeming multitudes arise,
the myriad **forms** unfold,
**flying, walking, hiding, stirring**—
all **movement** and **growth**, all **sentient beings**,
high and low, great and small,
the **wise** and **foolish**, the **sage** and the **common**—
each is **enveloped** by **form**, each **fulfills** its own **life**,
none failing to receive according to its measure,
none needing **refinement** to satisfy its **desires**.
Each **form** and **color** sustains itself—
it seems as though there is **privacy**,
yet **Heaven’s Dao** is without **privacy**,
so its **privacy** is its **publicity**,
its **lack of virtue** is its **virtue**—
the Sage, through his **lack of privacy**,
thus fulfills his **privacy**.
What is called **public** is **royal**,
**royal** is **Heavenly**,
**Heavenly** is **Dao**—
only **Dao** is free from the calamity of **partiality** and **opposition**."

The **regulation** of **birds** lies in **qi**—
**Explication** says:
*"To **fix** and **preserve life** is called **form**;
to **move** and **direct form** is called **qi**.
When **form** stands and **qi** spreads,
**spirits** revolve within—
this is called **divine**.
Thus when **qi** is complete,
**divine stillness** is born.

When **anger** arises, **qi** ascends and does not descend;
when **joy** arises, **qi** relaxes and does not gather;
when **sorrow** arises, **qi** dissipates and does not rest;
when **fear** arises, **qi** sinks and does not rise;
when **thought** arises, **qi** condenses and does not disperse—
only when **form** and **qi** move together in the **pivot** of **spirit** does this occur.
The Sage **regulates** this with **method**,
and none can **oppose** him.

*Mencius* says:
*"The most **vast** and **unyielding**,
nourished by **rectitude** and without **harm**,
fills the space between **Heaven** and **Earth**.
How could it **clash** with things,
**wearing down** and **exhausting** itself in the **realm** of **desires** and **aversions**?
It **governs** all **movement**,
its **function** matching **Heaven** and **Earth’s** **covering and loading**,
its **use** aligning with **yin** and **yang’s** **transformations**—
yet its **qi** overflows the **six voids**.
Like the **birds**,
it **rides the wind**, **stirs its wings**,
soaring through the **vast emptiness**—
some **ascend** on the **updraft** to **nine ten-thousands of li**,
**piercing the clouds**, **bearing the sky**—
how does this differ from the Sage’s **play** in **freedom’s** **wandering**?

The **regulation** of **birds** lies in **qi**—
**qi** takes **yang** as its **master**,
and **birds** cannot **abandon** it.
**Exhaustion** brings **change**,
and from **self-honor** to **self-defense** it **transforms**,
only then can it be **regulated**.
All things that are **regulated** have **attachments**,
thus **regulation** and **application** are called **law**.
What is **within me** is all **ancient regulation**.
Those that **leap** high and **soar** low,
never exceeding **a few zèng**,
yet **hovering** among the **reeds**—
this too is **flight’s** **fulfillment**.
Who **directs** them to **regulation**?
The **discrimination** of **small** and **great**—
is this **qi**?

**Life** is the **root** of **death**,
**death** is the **root** of **life**—
**Explication** says:
*"All things, teeming and myriad,
each return to their **root**.
‘Restoring **fate**’ means:
**knowing constancy** is called **clarity**.
All things **attached** to **entry** and **exit**—
**endless** **coming** and **going**.
This is called the **pivot of Dao** residing in the **trigrams’** **substance**,
and **Gèn** **dwelling** in the **northeast** is the case.

Thus it can **complete** the **beginning** of all things,
**cling to origin** and **branch outward**—
**wood** **relies** on it to **halt**,
yet its **station** is not the **true north**—
**virtue** arises from **harm**,
**harm** arises from **virtue**—
**Explication** says:
*"Examining the **logic** of the **Five Phases**,
those with **virtue** must have **harm**,
those with **harm** must have **virtue**.
Take **Metal** as **father** and **Wood** as **child** as an example—
when **Metal** is **applied**, **Wood** is **injured** at its **beginning**;
when **Wood** is **applied**, **Metal** is **injured** at its **end**.
If **Metal** **overcomes** **Wood**,
then **Wood** is **damaged**—
this is the **type** where **virtue** arises from **harm**.
Laozi says:
*"When **wisdom** and **discernment** emerge,
**great deception** appears.
When the **six relationships** are **not harmonized**,
there is **filial piety** and **benevolence**.
**Filial piety** and **benevolence** originally arise from **nature**;
in the **age of perfect virtue**,
people **fulfill** their **nature**,
and the **people** live in **harmony**—
who **distinguishes** **filial piety** and **benevolence**?
When **pure** and **authentic** are **diluted**,
those who **purchase fame** through **filial piety** and **benevolence** emerge,
and the **six relationships** become **not harmonized**."*

「This is the **type** where **harm** arises from **enmity/benefit**.

Moreover, **great enmity** is **without enmity**, **great virtue** is **most private**—
**enmity** and **benefit** follow in succession,
using **idleness** to **deceive** the **multitude**.

Who can **transcend** the **Five Bandits** and **Three Thefts**?

Only the **Sage** follows the **Dao/Way of Heaven**,
**benefiting** without **harming**,
able to make both **not injure** each other,
while their **virtue/power** **intermingles** and **returns**.

The **foolish** say that Heaven’s **patterns** and Earth’s **principles** make one **Sage**,
I say that **timely** **things** and **material** **wisdom** make one **philosophical**.

The **Explication** says:
Heaven has **patterns**, Earth has **principles**,
The **Sage** **observes** them in **bowing** and **looking upward**,
and **fulfills** the **uses** of the **body** with **completeness**.

Only the **people** are **most foolish yet spiritually attuned**,
**most lowly yet noble**—
those who **transform** from **common** to **Sage**,
how could they **differ** in **wealth and nobility** or **poverty and lowliness**?

The *Classic of Documents* says:
*"Only the **Sage** **forgets** **selfishness** and **acts madly**,
Only the **mad** **overcome** **selfishness** and **become Sage**."*

Indeed, **reciting** the words of **Emperor Yao** while **walking** the **Dao/Way of Yao**—
that is **Emperor Yao** himself.

Thus it is said:
The **foolish** say that Heaven’s **patterns** and Earth’s **principles** make one **Sage**,
I say that **timely** **things** and **material** **wisdom** make one **philosophical**—
because **all things** are **complete within me**,
then **deploying enemies** and **measuring responses** **exhausts** the **establishment** of my **principles**.

**"Treatment"** is said when **things** are **not contrary** to me,
then **discarding wisdom** and **artifice** to **respond** to the **principles** of **things**.

Thus, the **Heavenly Dao/Way**’s **classic** and Earth’s **principles**—
above, the **patterns** of the **sun, moon, stars, and constellations**,
below, the **principles** of **mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees**.
There is **eastern and southern** **patterns**,
sufficient to **govern** all **directions**;
**unifying** the **Three Powers**,
sufficient to **transform and nourish** all **movements**.

It has **never** failed to **follow** the **sun’s** **advance and retreat**,
to **determine** my **responses** accordingly.

He who **grasps** the **principles of timely things**,
to **observe** the **changes** of **universal correspondence**—
then his **philosophy** is sufficient to **subdue** the **multitude**,
and his **words** are sufficient to **command** **things**.

There is **deep philosophy**,
there is **inherent philosophy**,
there is **practical philosophy**,
there is **illuminating philosophy**—
Only the **Sage** **rides the times** and **comforts the world**,
**practices** **philosophy**,
**originally** **Heaven and Earth’s** **beauty**,
**observes** the **source** of **ten thousand transformations**—
what more could be **added** to me?

I **do nothing**, yet the **people** **transform** naturally;
I **love tranquility**, yet the **people** **become upright**.

Moreover, Heaven has its **times**, Earth has its **things**—
speaking of **Heaven and Earth** refers to their **manifest forms** and **instruments**,
speaking of **timely things** refers to their **marvelous applications**.

The **foolish** **demonstrate** their **edges**,
I **attain** their **marvels**.

**Emperor Yao’s** **cleverness, brilliance, and profound thoughts**,
yet he **governed** the **people** with the **Dao/Way**;
**Emperor Shun’s** **deep philosophy and brilliance**,
yet he **served** Heaven with **human affairs**.

**Embodying** this **Dao/Way** and **following** its **times**—
it is **one** and the **same**.

I **originally** **follow** the **first chapter**,
**holding** Heaven’s **actions**,
**continuing** with the **Five Bandits**,
**concluding** with **refinement and cultivation**—
this is called the **Sage**.

The **middle chapter** **begins** with Earth’s **Thefts**,
**continues** with the **Three Thefts** and **Three Powers**,
**concludes** with the **Noble** **firmly** **embracing** their **self**,
the **petty** **lightly** **discarding** their **life**.

The **last chapter** **begins** with:
*"The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in seeing"*—
and **concludes** with the **foolish** saying that Heaven’s **patterns** and Earth’s **principles** make one **Sage**,
I say that **timely things** and **material wisdom** make one **philosophical**—
why is this?

Because **"no action yet action"** is Heaven,
**"no attainment yet attainment"** is **Fate**.

When **observing** Heaven yet **not aiding** it,
it is the **preservation** of the **form** and **spirit** at their **beginning**,
yet the **means** of **Fate** are **evil**.

The **Bandits** **injure** their **principles**,
yet **do not affect** Earth.

**Refining** the **True** and **cultivating** the **Nature**—
all are **means** to **follow** Heaven’s **natural Dao/Way**,
not the **Sage** of the **world**,
who could **do this**?

The **Noble** **embrace** their **self**,
the **petty** **lightly discard** their **life**—
how could **people** of the **world** **not know** to **wear** their **high and thick** **sandals**,
while **ignoring** the **paths** of **auspiciousness** and **inauspiciousness**?

Then **distinguish** the **Three Thefts** to **exhaust** their **measures**,
**penetrate** the **Three Powers** to **unify** them as **one**,
and **finally** there is the **discrimination** of **Noble** and **petty**.

**Walking** the **Law** and **awaiting** **Fate**—
how could the **petty** **do this**?

Only the **Noble** **settle** in **times** and **harmonize** with **order**.

As for **discussing** **good vision** and **good hearing**,
while the **source** of **benefit** has **tenfold** or **ten-thousand-fold** **differences**—
this is how **foolish** and **Sage** **differ**.

If the **foolish** **reach** the **Sage**,
they can also **attain** the **refinement and cultivation**,
**using** their **philosophy** to **observe** Heaven’s **actions**,
then **observing** Heaven’s **Dao/Way** and **holding** Heaven’s **actions**—
**exhausted**.

Just as **Laozi’s** *Book* **begins** with *"The Dao/Way that can be Dao’d"*,
and **ends** with *"Acting yet not contending"*—
the **meaning** of the **three chapters** is **thus**.

The **beginning** and **end** **respond** to each other **like this**,
just as **Sunzi’s** *Art of War* **discusses** war and says:
*"Subtle! Subtle! Until it is **without form**,
Mysterious! Mysterious! Until it is **without sound**."*

The **means** to **dispel** **doubt and fear** in the **military** must **borrow** from **divination**,
**Duke of Zhou’s Master** says:
*"Decayed grasses and withered bones—
there is **no need** for **divination** to **deceive** the **multitude**,
yet **divination** **settles** the **multitude’s** **confusion**."*

**Deploy** **appropriately** **beforehand**,
**Duke of Zhou’s Master** **perfects** the **scheme** **afterward**,
the **meeting** of **schemes**—
the **Sage** has **never** **failed** to **unify** them,
yet all have the **Dao/Way of beginning and end**.

In the past, **those who explained** it
**divided** the **Sage’s** **embrace of Oneness**,
**immortality and transcendence**,
**wealth and prosperity**,
**peace for the state and nourishment for the people**,
**strengthening armies and achieving victory**—
they **observed** **Duke of Zhou’s Master** telling **King Wu**:
*"The **principles** of war **do not exceed** **Oneness**,
**Oneness** is able to **go alone** and **return alone**."*

**The Yellow Emperor** said:
*"**Oneness** **ascends** through the **Dao/Way**,
**approaches** the **Divine**,
**applies** it in **schemes**,
**manifests** it in the **world**,
**completes** it in the **Sovereign**."*

**Emperor Taizong** told **Ji Rong**:
*"Reading **thousands of chapters** and **millions of sentences**,
is **not as good** as **awakening** to **one sentence**."*

Indeed, **unifying** **Oneness**,
**all affairs** are **completed**.

From **ancient times** to **the present**,
**giving birth** to Heaven and Earth—
**abandoning** this, what else is there?

If one **has obtained** its **Mother**,
then they **know** its **Children**—
then **applying** the **Five Phases’** **cyclical succession**,
**observing** the **changes** of the **Four Seasons**—
the **classics and annals** **reverence** this,
the **Immortal and Sage** **dwell** here.
What the **knowing** cannot **reach**,
what the **thinking** cannot **attain**—
unless one **researches** to **extreme depths**,
how could they **comprehend** the **restraints** and **controls**,
**grasp** the **pivotal essentials**,
and **unify** the **convergence** of the **principles**,
**entering** the **gateway** of **marvelous attainment**?

Only the **most Divine** of the **world**,
then can **embody** the **marvels** **where they reside**,
**see** the **Dawn’s** **uniqueness**,
and **obtain** the **source** of the **opening and closing**—
**having** it for **benefit**,
**not having** it for **use**,
**not knowing** its **exhaustion**."*

**"One root, the sage’s character—
followed by one hundred fourteen words—
this is incorrect.
The *Yellow Emperor’s Yinyu Jing* commentary concludes here."**
