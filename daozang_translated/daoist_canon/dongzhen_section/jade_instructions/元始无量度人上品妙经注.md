**Preface to the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Salvation of Humankind**

Just as fine jade buried in dust requires the craft of grinding and polishing, so too do profound words concealed in mystery depend on the labor of elucidation. Thus, the transmitted words of classics and commentaries, the finite imagery of the *Book of Changes*—all reveal their numinous insight only when the subtle workings of the spirit awaken and the mysterious principles become manifest.

We reverently consider the *Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Limitless Salvation of Humankind from the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure of the Most High*—its characters formed by soaring mystery and coagulated qi, its text woven from cloud-seals. It stands as the origin of the myriad dharmas, the crown of the Three Caverns. Profound and recondite, its depths defy easy exploration. Without having already penetrated its hidden subtleties, who would dare to presume upon its annotation? Moreover, lesser adepts rarely glimpse even its chapter titles, for the esoteric regulations strictly forbid reckless transmission. Though one may recite it diligently, its essential purport remains obscure—like one who approaches a treasure trove only to return empty-handed, or who traces the contours of ink without gaining anything.

Thereupon, the Perfected Qingyuan of the Eastern Sea, moved by such ignorance, broadly expounded its resounding truth. He refuted the dubious passages of old and new texts, established essential discourses, and systematically elucidated eight matters while explicating two chapters. Beginning with the causes of inherent principle, he concluded by revealing the secrets of the root of life, dispelling blindness and deafness, unfolding the Dao and ascending to perfection. He shattered the peripheral views of attachment and guided those who seek the origins of profound learning. At times, he drew upon the subtlest of analogies; at others, he discoursed upon the mysterious in intricate detail. His words were no different from those of the Compassionate Venerable of the Vast Kalpas, uttered from a golden mouth. Where his explanations remained incomplete, I composed verses to further embellish their meaning, enabling reciters to delve deeply into its mysteries. Thereafter, as the earth trembled and radiance burst forth, pearls of millet manifested everywhere. Through words, one awakens to principle; through principle, every person’s dharmic ailments are instantly dispelled. This is the wellspring of the religious tradition, the fundamental purport of salvation—hence its name, *Limitless*. Disseminated among Daoist disciples, carved into wood and printed, it is widely bestowed upon the unenlightened. Could this not be a small contribution to the world?

**The Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Limitless Salvation of Humankind from the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure of the Most High**

The wondrousness of the two characters *Tai Shang* (Most High) cannot be fully expressed in words. Before the undifferentiated chaos, this single qi abided within the indistinct and nebulous, nameless and formless, containing the numinous essence of the True One—this is its image. *Tai* means great, the most supreme appellation. *Shang* means exalted, occupying the loftiest position. Before heaven and earth divided, the Five Ultimates first arose: the Supreme Void, the Supreme Origin, the Supreme Simplicity, the Supreme Substance, and the Supreme Ultimate. Only after the Five Ultimates separated were the Three Powers established and the positions of Qian and Kun arranged. The Dao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and the king is also great. The Dao attains its greatness through the One, hence it is called *Tai*. *Shang* gathers the essence of the Three Powers, thus becoming supreme. The Most High is the ancestor of virtue and power, the root of heaven and earth—hence it is placed at the beginning of the scripture.

*Dongxuan* (Cavernous Mystery) refers to the ranks of the Three Caverns: *Dongzhen* (Cavern of Perfection), *Dongxuan* (Cavern of Mystery), and *Dongshen* (Cavern of Spirit). *Dong* means penetrating and pervading; *xuan* means profound and wondrous. It signifies that the Primordial Beginning thoroughly penetrates the undivided Dao of the Mysterious One to govern the Numinous Treasure.

*Lingbao* (Numinous Treasure): The Lord of the Jade Dawn received the qi of the Primordial Beginning’s Mysterious One and transformed it into the Red Clarity Kalpa, establishing the Palace of the Numinous Treasure. This scripture was thus transmitted by the Lord from the teachings of the Primordial Beginning. *Ling* means containing and nurturing the myriad things, its transformations inexhaustible. *Bao* means radiant and luminous, cherished by all. This Numinous Treasure is the origin of the myriad transformations, the ancestor of the divine and numinous, interweaving the heavens and giving rise to the ten thousand existences—all depend upon it.

*Wuliang Duren* (Limitless Salvation of Humankind): Since the vast kalpas, the Primordial and Supreme Sage has broadly transformed sentient beings, elevating the ordinary to sagehood. Its calculations and analogies are beyond measure, extending from ancient times to the present without boundary. It makes the foolish wise and the dull intelligent—hence it is called *Limitless Salvation of Humankind*.

*Shangpin* (Supreme Grade): Among the thirty-six sections of the Three Caverns, which encompass the Dharma Treasury of the Heavens and total over three million nine hundred thousand texts, none surpass this scripture. At the end and beginning of kalpas, it alone strides across the Jade Capital—hence it is called the *Supreme Grade*.

*Miao* means subtle and wondrous; *jing* means ordering and organizing. *Jing* also means path—the path of cultivation for humans and devas, of entering the Dao and leaving the mundane, of ascending to immortality.

**Verse:**
The Great Dao unfurls, weaving the Cavernous Mystery,
Aiding beings and benefiting things without bound.
If mortal wombs aspire to become soaring immortals,
For my sake, purify your heart and read this wondrous scripture.

**The Words of the Dao:**
That which cannot be seen is called the Dao; that which cannot be heard is called speech. The Dao as Dao is pure, still, empty, and quiescent—beyond naming or modeling. Even the Most High does not know it; how can it be forcibly named? How can it be spoken of in words? Only the Lord of the Dao of the Most High, having thoroughly comprehended the subtle origins of the Primordial Beginning and deeply penetrated the Way of the Numinous Treasure, employed provisional images and transformations to enable sentient beings to awaken to the Numinous Treasure, provisionally calling it speech.

The Dao as speech is like seeking fish and rabbits, which necessarily relies on traps and snares. Once the fish and rabbits are obtained, the traps and snares should be forgotten. The Dao is the fish and rabbit of the empty and mysterious; speech is the trap and snare of the Great Dao. The Dao is fundamentally wordless; through words, its function is revealed—hence it is called the *Words of the Dao*.

**Verse:**
The Dao is fundamentally soundless—how could it have words?
The Sage established teachings and forcibly proclaimed them.
To catch fish, one must rely on the power of traps;
Once the fish is caught, what use are the traps?

**Annotation says:** The *Daode Jing* states: "There is a thing, chaotic yet complete, born before heaven and earth—it is named the Dao." Now, the Dao is truly the same for heaven, earth, and humanity; its root in humans is called the heart, and within the heart, it is called nature. Nature is the Dao, and the Dao is nature. Those who fully realize their nature and reach their destiny achieve wondrous unity of form and spirit, merging with the Dao in truth.

The Confucians say: "Speech is sound." For the Dao is the essence of the heart, while speech is its function. The Dao Lord expounded the teachings of the Primordial Beginning, employing the human heart to deliver beings—hence it is called *Words of the Dao*.

Formerly, in the Azure Heavens of the Beginning, amidst the Empty Songs of the Azure Vault, the Land of Great Fuli resounded with the melody of salvation. There, the *Primordial Beginning’s Scripture of Salvation: The Limitless Supreme Grade* was received. "Formerly" refers to the immeasurable kalpas of the distant past. The Most High Dao Lord said: "In the past, I received this supreme scripture from the Primordial Beginning."

The Beginning Azure is one of the Nine Radiant Heavens of the Great Brahmā in the East. This heaven was formed from the luminous essence of the Azure Radiance and the Treasure of Brahmā. The East is the origin of all directions. The Heavenly Worthy, in expounding the *Numinous Treasure Scripture of Salvation*, convened over a hundred assemblies, first descending upon this heaven to demonstrate its preeminence and the supremacy of this scripture.

The qi of this heaven is azure and green, transforming into azure mists that spread boundlessly—hence it is called the Azure Vault. The qi of the Azure Vault, stirred by divine winds, naturally forms Empty Songs, unfolding the wondrous mystery of neither emptiness nor form—thus it is called Empty Song. This heaven contains a realm named Great Fuli. "Fu" means emptiness; "Li" means splendor. Its qi floats and drifts, surpassing all in majestic beauty—hence it is called Fuli. While lands may be pure or defiled, this great realm, with its Empty Songs of the Azure Vault, its emptiness and primal splendor, stands as the foremost of pure domains, beyond comparison with the Three Realms.

The merit of this scripture in delivering beings is boundless—hence it is titled *The Primordial Beginning’s Scripture of Salvation: The Limitless Supreme Grade*.

**Verse:**
At the first unfolding of the Primordial Beginning’s supreme grade,
A single sound emerged, heard by all.
The lamp of the Dharma permits later generations to continue;
Not only the Heavenly Worthy and Dao Lord alone.

**Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy:**
"Yuan" means profound. Profound unity, the profound within the profound, is the gateway to all wonders. "Shi" means beginning. The Primordial Beginning, inheriting the Dao of profound unity, existed at the very inception, before heaven and earth, as the source of all wonders and the origin of all births—hence it is called the Primordial Beginning. "Tian" signifies the highest of the single qi; "Zun" denotes the utmost depth of all dharmas. When the primordial qi was still undifferentiated, it abided in serene independence. Heaven and earth rely upon it for their majesty and greatness—thus it is named the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy.

**Verse:**
When the great mass first divided, the primordial qi was undifferentiated,
Before heaven and earth, it alone was supreme.
Do not mistake it for the Primordial Sovereign—
This being has existed since time immemorial.

When expounding this scripture, the Heavenly Worthy circled ten times to summon the ten directions, only then ascending the seat. Formerly, when the Heavenly Worthy was about to expound this scripture, he performed the Dharma ten times in full, universally summoning the ten directions, and only then did the directions approach and take their seats. "Ten" is the ultimate number. Employing the ultimate Dharma to summon the spirits of the ultimate directions, how could they not respond? Qi transforms and resonates, and the response is thus.

"Zhou" means pervading and communicating; "Hui" means circulating in both forward and reverse, clarifying the principle of summoning. The Dharma is universally applied, and the Dao is never transmitted falsely—this is the way of the Primordial Beginning in summoning spirits and commanding the true.

If one abides in the practice of the Lord of the Womb and performs the Dharma of circling ten times, the thirty-six thousand spirits and qi will all gather in response.

**Verse:**
When the Heavenly Worthy sought to reveal the mystery,
The Dharma summoned all directions to make it known.
Only because the host attained samādhi,
Did all movements naturally follow.

The Great Perfected Divine Ones, the Supreme Sages and Lofty Worthies, the Wondrously Practiced Perfected Ones, and the innumerable multitudes arrived riding the void. The Great Perfected Divine Ones have transcended the Three Realms, requiring no cultivation or realization. The Supreme Sages and Lofty Worthies begin with cultivation, attain realization, and ascend to perfection. The Wondrously Practiced Perfected Ones accumulate wondrous deeds to become true, naturally merging with the Dao. "Innumerable" describes their vast numbers. All, being able to fly freely through the Primordial Beginning, come and go without obstruction—hence it is said they ride the void.

When the Heavenly Worthy was about to expound this scripture, he first divided it into three grades to encourage the lofty perfected ones. Cultivation of the true lies within the person—it is the essence, qi, and spirit. If one’s womb-essence is firmly stabilized, the myriad qi become profoundly still, differing little from the innumerable multitudes.

Crimson clouds soared through the cinnabar skies; jade chariots and emerald carriages, feathered canopies casting shade, flowing essence and radiant jade light, five colors flourishing in brilliance, illuminating the vast heavens for seven days and seven nights. Crimson clouds and cinnabar skies, five-colored radiance—all are the numinous manifestations of the supreme sages. When gathered, they form clouds; when dispersed, they become qi. The purest yang becomes clouds and mists; the purest yin becomes wheels and canopies. As for the flowing essence and luminous hues, the flourishing brilliance of five colors illuminating the vast heavens—all are the wondrous transformations of convergence.

Within the person, these are the splendor of the five viscera. When refined according to the method, with the numbers of yin and yang fulfilled, the Numinous Treasure radiates light, bathing the entire body, penetrating the empty landscape. Three is the number of yang; four is the number of yin. Combined, they make seven. The radiance of the sages revolves endlessly, enduring even after countless kalpas—how could it be limited to seven days and seven nights? This principle is modeled on yin and yang.

The sun, moon, and stars of all heavens, from the Great Luo downward, the jade celestial pivots and armillary spheres, all halted their revolutions. From the Great Luo Heaven downward, each heaven possesses its own sun, moon, and stars, serving as the mechanisms of primordial transformation. The "xuanji" is the Dipper; the "yuheng" is its handle. Waxing and waning, growth and decline, day and night—all revolve ceaselessly. Now, with the Heavenly Worthy expounding the Dharma in samādhi, the movements of all heavenly bodies temporarily ceased, manifesting the wondrous function.

Within the person, the heart is the celestial pivot, and the eyes are the sun and moon. When both heart and eyes are stabilized, the myriad transformations all come to rest.

○ The Collator notes: The scripture states, "The sun, moon, and celestial pivots halted their revolutions." This, too, employs metaphorical imagery for instruction. As the *Qingyuan* commentary observes, when within the person both heart and eyes are stabilized, the myriad transformations all come to rest—this is indeed a precise guide for beginners entering samādhi. According to the *Sacred Record of Lord Lao*: "Constantly practice cessation and contemplation to examine the heart"—this is its meaning.

When the divine wind is still and silent, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds; the heavens hold no drifting veils, and the four qi grow luminously pure. With the Heavenly Worthy in samādhi, all realms become emptily primordial; yin and yang harmonize, and the winds, clouds, and atmospheric qi naturally turn serene. Yet if one observes the body with wisdom, and the mechanisms of karmic conditions remain unmoved, then the breath of inhalation and exhalation settles into profound stillness—what qi would not be purified?

A verse says:
*The divine wind is still, the sea holds no clouds,
Heaven and earth grow clear, the four qi pure.
Should a single condition stir in delusion,
The celestial pivot turns once more without cease.*

The Collator notes: The theory of the four qi is not elaborated in the scriptural commentary. However, the *Record of the Great Illumination of the Dharma* by Master Guitang cites this passage in discussing the wonder of the "Four Perfections." The purity of the four qi corresponds to the Four Perfections: true constancy, true self, true bliss, and true purity, revealing the wondrous fusion of nature and destiny. This is appended here for reference.

Within a realm, the land, mountains, rivers, and forests all become level and uniform, no longer distinguished by height or depth; the earth transforms into azure jade, without variation in hue. The assembled perfected ones attend in the assembly.

Examining it through symbolic correspondence, the land of a single realm is the Floating Blackness. Yet when viewed through the Dao, the entire sky and earth should be considered as one primordial realm. Mountains, rivers, forests, and trees vary in height and depth, flourish and wither unequally, while the soil differs in purity and filth. Now, in the midst of expounding the Dharma, all becomes level and equal, uniformly assuming the form of jade, without distinction or disparity. The assembled perfected ones attend the seat, merely observing this function—what a spectacle it is!

Within the human body, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees are all fully present. Through the power of meditative concentration, one observes them, and instantly the dusts settle, all becoming level and uniform, flawless as jade—how could there be any distinction of high or low? It rests solely in the mind. If the mind is not level, it becomes mounds and hills.

The ode states:
A realm’s mountains and rivers lie within one’s own body,
In meditative vision, all is smooth and level.
Pure as jade’s hue, originally without difference,
High and low arise entirely from delusion.

The Collator notes: The scripture speaks of "level and uniform, without distinction of high or low," and "without variation in hue"—these are all provisional images for instruction. The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: "This Dharma is equal, without high or low." Chan Master Huangbo Xiyun explains: "If the mind is equal, making no distinction of high or low, then it is one with the mountains, rivers, and worlds of sentient beings and buddhas—whether form or formless, pervading the ten directions—all equally level, without the marks of self and other. This is the originally pure mind, ever perfectly luminous and all-pervading." Its meaning accords precisely with this passage, and thus it is appended here for reference.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy suspended himself in midair, seated upon a five-colored lion. First, he summoned the multitude of perfected beings through the power of the Dao and its methods; next, he equalized delusion and truth through the power of samādhi. Once truth and delusion were stilled, he ultimately ascended into the Mystery—this is the meaning of "suspended in midair." Moreover, "suspended" signifies the unfathomable; "midair" signifies the boundless. "Suspended" is the profound; "midair" is the void. Seated in profound void, he did not cling to concrete forms. The lion is king among the hundred beasts, clarifying that this is the master of the Dharma. Subduing all beasts, it represents the Heavenly Worthy transforming beings with fearlessness, vanquishing the hundred demons, and guiding them to the realm of the Dao. The five colors illuminate the five senses of humans and gods—eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body—along with their corresponding objects: form, sound, scent, taste, and touch, which are the roots of illusion. Those who cultivate and study must first subdue these and sit upon them. Though the Heavenly Worthy ascends this seat, his body remains suspended in midair, intending to teach people to empty their minds and externalize their forms, so that the Dao may respond—this is the foundation of transcendence.

A verse says:
The Dharmakāya is serene and quiescent, originally true and constant;
To seek it in form and appearance is fundamentally delusion.
An empty mind is the seat suspended in midair;
Right intention is called the king of the hundred beasts.

After expounding the scripture once, all the heavenly and sagely beings simultaneously voiced their approval. At that time, all the deaf and ailing men and women in the land had their ears opened and became keen of hearing. After expounding the scripture a second time, the blind had their eyes opened. After a third expounding, the mute could speak. After a fourth, the lame, paralyzed, and chronically ill could all rise and walk. After a fifth, those with long-standing and intractable illnesses were instantly restored to health. After a sixth, white hair turned black again, and fallen teeth regrew. After a seventh, the old became youthful, and the young grew strong. After an eighth, pregnant women, birds, and beasts—whether their offspring were born or unborn—all achieved perfect development. After a ninth, the earth’s treasuries were revealed, and gold and jade appeared. After a tenth, withered bones revived and stood as living people. At that time, every man and woman in the land turned their hearts wholeheartedly toward the Dao, all received protection and deliverance, and each attained longevity.

When the Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture, he did not merely direct his spiritual thoughts to reciting it once but raised and proclaimed the great Dharma. Thus, as soon as one recitation was complete, the heavenly and sagely beings, according to their rank and capacity, all received rebirth. Overwhelmed with awe and joy, their voices of praise and admiration arose as one, hence the exclamation of approval. The meaning of the ten recitations corresponds to the trigrams and their transformations. The first recitation summoned the boundless and immeasurable perfected great spirits of the eastern direction, corresponding to the trigram *Zhen* (☳). *Zhen* startles a hundred leagues, so the deaf and ailing had their ears opened and became keen of hearing. The second recitation summoned the southern direction, corresponding to the trigram *Li* (☲). *Li* illumines the myriad things, so the blind had their eyes opened. The third recitation summoned the western direction, corresponding to the trigram *Dui* (☱). *Dui* means "to speak," and through recitation and practice, the mute could speak. The fourth recitation summoned the northern direction, corresponding to the trigram *Kan* (☵). *Kan* means "to halt," but one cannot halt in the midst of things—halting is still movement, so the lame, paralyzed, and chronically ill could all rise and walk. The fifth recitation summoned the northeast, corresponding to the trigram *Gen* (☶). *Gen* signifies the end and beginning of things; ending and then beginning again, so those with long-standing and intractable illnesses were instantly restored to health. The sixth recitation summoned the southeast, corresponding to the trigram *Xun* (☴). *Xun* values purity and cleanliness, so white hair turned black again, and fallen teeth regrew. The seventh recitation summoned the southwest, corresponding to the trigram *Kun* (☷). The way of *Kun* is to nourish and govern, so the old became youthful, and the young grew strong. The eighth recitation summoned the northwest, corresponding to the trigram *Qian* (☰). The way of *Qian* is for each to rectify its nature and destiny, preserving the great harmony; thus, pregnant women, birds, and beasts—whether their offspring were born or unborn—all achieved perfect development. The ninth recitation revealed the earth’s treasuries, and gold and jade appeared. The yang of the ninth recitation naturally revealed its complete form, and having attained the generation of life and destiny, it further stimulated the opening of the earth’s treasuries, so that all people obtained the heavy treasures of gold and jade, transforming the foul and rotten into the divine and marvelous. The tenth recitation reached the ultimate number. At the ultimate, things return to their origin, so withered and decayed forms revived and stood as living people.

For living beings, deafness prevents hearing the Dao; blindness prevents seeing the Dao; muteness prevents proclaiming the Dao; lameness prevents walking the Dao; chronic illness prevents advancing in cultivation. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture four times to restore their faculties. By the completion of the tenth recitation, they returned to their original source. The work of delivering beings was then complete. Only when merit is perfected and the Dao is accomplished are all karmic obstructions instantly removed, so that all attain longevity and turn their hearts wholeheartedly toward the realm of the supreme Dao.

The commentary explains the meaning of the nine recitations, so the annotations of Xue Youqi are appended here.

A verse says:
The body must rely on the six senses to be complete;
When the nature of the senses is benighted, illness invades.
As soon as the ear first comprehends,
All illness vanishes, and one attains longevity.

The Dao says: At that time, when the Primordial Heavenly Worthy had expounded the scripture once, the boundless and immeasurable perfected great spirits of the eastern direction, along with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating in midair. After expounding the scripture a second time, the boundless and immeasurable perfected great spirits of the southern direction, along with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating in midair. After a third expounding, the boundless and immeasurable perfected great spirits of the western direction, along with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating in midair. After a fourth, the boundless and immeasurable perfected great spirits of the northern direction, along with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating in midair. After a fifth, the boundless and immeasurable perfected great spirits of the northeast, along with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating in midair. After a sixth, the boundless and immeasurable perfected great spirits of the southeast, along with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating in midair. After a seventh, the boundless and immeasurable perfected great spirits of the southwest, along with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating in midair.

After an eighth expounding, the boundless and immeasurable perfected great spirits of the northwest, along with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating in midair. After a ninth, the boundless and immeasurable perfected great spirits of the upper direction, along with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating in midair. After a tenth, the boundless and immeasurable perfected great spirits of the lower direction, along with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating in midair.

The Heavenly Worthy expounded the Dao ten times in succession, summoning the numinous and destined spirits, ferrying beings across, and weaving together these words—repetition and reiteration. For this scripture takes the salvation of humanity as its essence, thus first manifesting numinous proofs, then revealing the marvels of responsive manifestation.

The Dao Lord’s preface conveys this great meaning: it is not merely two instances of ten expoundings. All the perfected beings of every heaven and every realm in the ten directions—all those innumerable hosts of the boundless and immeasurable ranks—receive the qi of the utmost perfection and dwell within the vastest of domains. The spirits abide therein, their transformed bodies without limit, arriving at the Heavenly Worthy’s abode floating in midair. This is the spontaneous transformation of the primordial qi of the Origin, which naturally assumes fixed names.

The eastern direction, northeast, and the highest realms of meditative goodness—such as the Heaven of Immeasurable Life and the Heaven of Great Brightness and Jade Perfection—extend down to the Nine Earths, corresponding to the Zhen Palace and the Mao position: these are the innumerable. The southern direction and southeast encompass the Heaven of Brahma’s Oversight and the Heaven of Extending Brilliance down to the Heaven of Radiant Harmony and Yang Light, corresponding to the Li Palace and the Wu position. The western direction and southwest include the Heaven of Numinous Transformation and the Heaven of Brahma’s Assistance, the Heaven of Primordial Ascent and the Heaven of Empty Capacity, down to the Nine Earths and Nine Waters, corresponding to the Dui Palace and the You position. The northern direction and northwest comprise the Heaven of Lofty Emptiness and Clarity and the Heaven of Luminous Courts and Celestial Ascension down to the Kan Palace and the Zi position. The upper and lower directions contain the multitude of Nine Winds and Nine Waters. The hosts are beyond reckoning; the brush cannot record them all, so I speak but briefly.

At the beginning, the Origin dwelled in the Heavenly Palace of Pure Tenuity and expounded the Dao. At that time, the Jade Emperor arrived before the assembly, displaying the six spiritual penetrations and radiating great luminosity, illuminating the boundless Brahma-realms. He divided his body, manifesting in all the heavenly palaces. Now, each of those heavenly palaces displays the Jade Capital and Golden Towers, luminous jeweled thrones. Upon each jeweled throne sits a transformed body of the Jade Emperor, and each Jade Emperor expounds the Dao of liberation in his respective direction. Do these heavens each possess their own Jade Emperor? No—this is the teaching established to instruct humanity, the division of the true to bestow transformation.

A hymn says:
From of old, the divine spirits number in the billions,
Like echoes responding in an empty valley.
The sun and moon of the ten directions appear in the void—
Only to open the eye of Dao in the present person.

When the ten expoundings were complete, the boundless perfected great spirits of the ten directions arrived simultaneously. The men and women of one realm turned their hearts in reverence, coming forth like fine rain or dense mist—innumerable hosts filling half the land, causing the earth to tilt and sink, an unstoppable tide.

After the ten expoundings were complete and the ten directions fully assembled, then the heavenly and mortal men and women, moved by this divine transformation, turned their hearts in devotion and reverence, coming forth like fine rain flying through the air or dense mist enveloping all. Thus half the land was filled—how vast their numbers! This is because the Floating Black Realm is a land of limits, while the Heavenly Worthy manifests innumerable bodies. When the limitless multitude descends upon a confined space, they cannot be contained, hence the earth tilts and sinks. Moreover, the tilting and sinking illustrate that the hearts of heavenly and mortal beings, unenlightened by the utmost principle, are cramped and chaotic, their turmoil without end.

Thereupon, the Origin suspended a single treasure pearl, as small as a grain of millet, in the midst of the empty mystery, five measures above the earth. The treasure is what people cherish; the pearl is pure, clear, and perfectly luminous; the grain of millet is the most minute of things, yet its use is vast. This signifies that the body of the Numinous Treasure is subtle in form yet great in function, pure and luminous, beloved by all. Millet, the chief of the five grains, sustains human life and cannot be momentarily lacking—just as humanity cannot be momentarily separated from the Dao. Those who depart from it and yet survive are like humans without food: no longer human.

Suspended in the empty void, five measures above the earth, it demonstrates that the marvel of the Numinous Treasure is not constrained by the five movements, hidden in mystery within the Great Mystery. It shows that humans and heavens transcend the Five Turbidities, entrusting their marvel to the numinous void.

A hymn says:
A single treasure pearl, like a grain of millet—
Each person possesses it, not the Origin alone.
Neither above nor below, suspended in empty space—
Who can grasp the Heavenly Worthy’s intent?

The Origin ascended and led the perfected great spirits of heaven, the exalted sages and lofty worthies, the perfected of wondrous conduct, the boundless perfected great spirits of the ten directions, and the innumerable hosts—all entered the treasure pearl. The heavenly and mortal beings looked up and saw only a stirring (sound: *fú*) entering the pearl’s mouth; once inside, they knew not where they went. The people of the realm scattered (sound: *kuò*), and the earth returned to levelness, no longer tilting (sound: *qī*) or sinking.

That which cannot be seen is called “even”; that which cannot be heard is called “rare”; that which cannot be grasped is called “subtle.” These three cannot be investigated; they return to non-being. For the Dao’s subtlety and marvel originate in emptiness and nothingness—how could the bodies of the heavenly perfected have any obstruction? Yet as the heavenly beings, the perfected, and the sages mingled and gathered in clouds, the earth tilted and sank beyond restraint. How then could they be distinguished? Thus, transformation was employed to instruct humanity: the pearl was suspended to respond to the change, returning the formless to non-being.

“Ascended” means rising and climbing; “led” means guiding and instructing. The innumerable hosts had already merged with the true Dao, so they could follow the Heavenly Worthy into the pearl. But the heavenly and mortal beings, burdened by impurities, could not accompany them. Thus, the distinction between true and false bodies, between cultivation and realization, became evident.

Once the Dao had withdrawn, how could its traces be pursued? The people scattered, the land returned to levelness, and the tilting and sinking were no more. All this was the Origin’s manifestation of divine transformation—arising from non-being into being, returning from being into non-being, merging the Dao of the hundred spirits. It is not to be compared with mere techniques.

The Eulogy states:
The sage models the nature of emptiness,
Gathering and scattering—no difference, no sameness.
The ten thousand realms are drawn into the realm of true stillness,
Where else could one seek lingering traces?

Within the precious pearl, the Origin completed the sutra’s discourse. The host of perfected beings oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration defied expression. The Dharma rite was roughly concluded, the myriad heavens restored to their stations, and in the space of a *shūxū*—in an instant—all was silence, leaving no echo behind.

The Heavenly Worthy then led the perfected ones to ascend into the mysterious and enter the wondrous, transmitting the Dao and expounding the Dharma within the pearl, bestowing it upon the Most High Lord of the Dao. The host of perfected beings gathered to oversee the transmission, and the Lord of the Dao, having received this teaching, was filled with joy and celebration beyond words.

The "Dharma rite" refers to the ritual of transmission and reception. Though its proceedings were roughly detailed, the rite did not reach its conclusion before the heavens all returned to their positions. Why? The Dao of Numinous Treasure does not lie in complexity but values grasping its essence. Sage transmits to sage, and with a single hearing, a thousand insights arise—this principle knows no end.

In every brief moment, there are five *shūxū*, and within each *shūxū*, all is silence, leaving no lingering sound. This clarifies that the supreme Dao returns to the constant.

The Eulogy states:
This numinous root is originally thus,
To whom did the Heavenly Worthy personally entrust it?
From the Dragon Palace, a treasure worth cities was retrieved,
Securely stored in the golden coffer—let none be lost.

The analogy of the precious pearl suspended five *zhang* above the earth, when spoken of by those who cultivate life and refine destiny, elucidates the mysterious pass within the body. The meaning of five *zhang* is that a *zhang* is a *chi*, and a *chi* is a *cun*—this explanation is precise. Here, the annotation uses it as a metaphor for the wondrousness of the nature-pearl, its purport even more profound. For in the preceding passage, the Origin led the celestial perfected great spirits, the utmost perfected great spirits, and the innumerable hosts all into the pearl, while the heavenly and mortal beings could only gaze upward and could not accompany them, thus distinguishing the true and false bodies and the differences in cultivation and realization. Truly, only those who have truly seen and realized the Dao can enter the pure, luminous realm of the precious pearl—this is especially pertinent to the principle of realizing the nature. The five *zhang* also metaphorically signify transcending the five turbidities, unbound by the five movements—this interpretation is also valid. As for the final moment, in the space of a *shūxū*, all is silence without lingering echo, this signifies the completion of self-realization, returning to the One and the None. The Confucian *Doctrine of the Mean* speaks of the ultimate of "no sound, no scent"; the Buddhist canon speaks of the realization of "emptiness of persons, emptiness of dharmas, and emptiness of emptiness"; the *Classic of Purity and Stillness* speaks of the extreme of "emptying the existent, then emptying the empty"—all express this same principle. Thus, they are appended here.

At that time, the heavenly and mortal beings who encountered the scripture and Dharma universally attained deliverance, preserving their allotted years without premature harm. "Heavenly" refers to the heavens; "mortal" refers to worldly people. This passage speaks of both together to engage those of lower capacities. Whether encountering or merely coming upon it, all universally receive deliverance, preserving their allotted years without suffering the misfortune of premature death.

Now, the life of a person is endowed with the wondrous Dao, its nobility beyond words. Regardless of high or low status, all should live a hundred years. It depends solely on whether one’s actions are good or not. Whether due to past causes or future karma, one may cut short one’s own lifespan, unable to complete the allotted years—this is not because heaven makes distinctions. Among worldly people, those who live ninety years or more are called long-lived; those below seventy are in middle age, and those below fifty all die prematurely.

In Nanchang, there was a standard: those who accumulated good deeds and attained long life would, upon death, first undergo refinement and deliverance; otherwise, their bodies would remain to await it. The entire land turned in reverence, all cultivating a heart of goodness. They practiced:
No killing, no harming,
No envy, no jealousy,
No licentiousness, no theft,
No greed, no desire,
No hatred, no resentment.
Their words were free of embellishment, their mouths free of evil speech. They treated all with equal kindness, making kin of those not of their blood. The nation was at peace, the people prosperous, all rejoicing in great peace.

Now, "thoughts, perceptions, sights, and sounds" are all called killing. Falling into unrighteousness and damaging all things is called harming. Undermining others’ achievements is called envy. Feeling discontent at others’ prosperity is called jealousy. Infatuation with sensory pleasures is called licentiousness. Taking what is not rightfully one’s own is called theft. Insatiable craving is called greed. Deluded thoughts are called desire. Mocking others’ flaws is called hatred. Distrusting kindness and integrity is called resentment. Deceitful and exaggerated speech is called embellishment. Careless or ignorant words that mislead others are called evil speech.

Now that the men and women of the entire nation have attained protection and deliverance, the whole land turns in reverence, practicing the opposite—this is also called the twelve virtuous deeds. Moreover:
Not killing or harming removes the sins of bodily karma.
Not envying or jeolousy, not being greedy or desirous, not hating or resenting removes the sins of mental karma.
Words free of embellishment and mouths free of evil speech remove the sins of verbal karma.
Previously, ears were keen and eyes bright—this was the purity of the six senses. Now, the three karmas are instantly eradicated, thus perfecting the practice of kindness and love.

Kindness is harmony and gentleness, free of contention. Love is the mutual inclusion of self and others, benefiting oneself and others. The greatness of kindness and love is such that even those not of one’s blood become kin. Then, the nation is naturally at peace, the people naturally prosperous, all forgetting themselves in the realm of the Dao, rejoicing in the world of great peace. "Great" means pure and constant joy; "peace" means tranquility and freedom from desire. The nation is a metaphor for the body; the people, a metaphor for *qi*.

When the scripture first emerged as a teaching, the entire nation, those with prior aspiration and devotion, all revered and honored it. This passage speaks of the Lord of the Dao, upon first receiving this scripture, teaching and guiding those in the nation with prior aspiration, all of whom revered and honored it. "Revered" means venerating this scripture as a boat or oar, a bridge or beam—relying on it to seek deliverance. "Honored" means esteeming this scripture as if the Heavenly Worthy personally taught it to me, and I personally heard its meaning.

Seeking to recite its words and practice its deeds.

"Reverence" means serving this scripture as one would serve father or mother, teacher or elder—fearing and loving it, ever wary of neglect. "Respect" means treasuring this scripture as gold or treasure, as pearls or jade, cherishing it without cease, ever fearful of losing it. Having fully cultivated these four dispositions, all may attain deliverance from the world and long life.

A verse says:
Ink marks trace lines, vainly toiling the form—
One must practice goodness, heed the admonition.
For long life and deliverance from the world, there is no other way,
But to cultivate and uphold a single heart.

The Dao says: The names spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy in this scripture are the hidden rhymes of the inner names of the Celestial Emperors of the various heavens, as well as the inner taboos of demon kings and the concealed names of the hundred spirits. They are not the common words of this world. Only the perfected *zhenren* who have attained the Dao, penetrated the mysterious, and plumbed the subtle can fully grasp its chapters. Reciting it ten times, the heavens echo from afar, the ten thousand emperors pay homage, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds, sun and moon pause in their course, the celestial pivots cease turning, all demons bind their forms, ghostly spirits perish in clarity, the dead return to life, and white bones become human again.

The thirty-two Celestial Emperors are the hidden rhymes of inner names. From the Azure Emperor who guards the soul to the Eight Flowing Bells, these are the inner taboos of demon kings. From the Immortal Gods of Undying to Peach Vitality and Union Longevity, all are the concealed names of the hundred spirits. The *Lingbao* is the ancestor of the Dao’s *qi*; deliverance of humanity is the foremost of the hundred methods. The Primordial Beginning, containing the wondrous Dao, expounds the Dharma to deliver humanity, dispersing its written words and composing them into rhymes—unlike the writings of the lower world. Middle and lower immortals cannot even glimpse its chapters; only the perfected *zhenren* who have deeply entered the Dao’s wonders can begin to fathom its mysteries.

As for "rhyme," it refers to harmonious sounds. Moreover, the myriad emperors of the heavens, the sun and moon, mountains and rivers all take form from the dispersal of the ancestral *qi*. Now, when the Heavenly Worthy expounds the Dharma, it is with the sound of the ancestral *qi*, gathering and refining the dispersed forms of *qi*. How could they not respond? Thus, clouds and mist conceal themselves, the three luminaries pause in stillness, ghosts vanish and demons dissipate, all return to the origin and revert to the root—each and every response arises from the settled vision. It is like the *lü* and *liu* summoning yin and yang—a necessary principle.

A verse says:
Penetrating the mysterious and subtle, one knows the ancestral Dao,
Mountains and rivers, sun and moon share a single family’s wind.
Not that one vainly extols the *Lingbao*,
But that the true person’s settled realm naturally fuses.

For those of utmost learning who recite it ten times, the Five Emperors stand guard, the Three Realms bow in reverence, demonic spirits lose their sight, ghostly and spectral beings perish in clarity, and those on the verge of death are delivered to new life. The reason is this: the scholar’s impure *qi* has not yet dissipated, their body has not fully attained the true, their summons cannot command the ten directions, their power cannot govern the celestial administrations, yet their virtue can subdue and restrain earthly deities, bind demonic spirits, and merely ward off death—unable to restore life. Through diligent and unwavering practice, without retreat, one is called a scholar of utmost learning. Thus, reciting the scripture ten times, the Five Emperors of the five directions all come to guard, the spirits of the Three Realms bow in reverence and submission, and all demonic ghosts lose their sight and perish.

Now, when the scholar’s cultivation reaches its peak, the body is refined and *qi* stilled, the spirits of the body guard it without parting—this is what is meant by the spirit’s awareness guarding itself. The Three Realms are a metaphor for the three corpses; the Five Emperors, for the five viscera. When the ten thousand conditions arise in profusion, this is called inner demons; when calamities and hardships press in, these are outer demons. The most severe of sufferings is called "essence," hence "demonic essence." The seven emotions and six desires are called "ghosts"; confusion and inversion that obstruct the Dao and virtue are called "specters." Through utmost learning and scripture recitation, none can invade.

Even when the great limit arrives, one can resist the ghostly and spectral killers, preserving this life. Yet this only subdues and restrains earthly deities—merely warding off death, unable to further transform this bodily frame for long life and enduring vision. Thus it is said: "Though one recites the scriptures for a hundred thousand kalpas, in the end it still belongs to emptiness and perishing." For the *zhenren* merges and communicates with the Dao; the scholar of utmost learning has not yet exhausted worldly passions. In reciting the scriptures, their rank and position differ. The reason is that the illusory and false, though thoroughly examined, are ultimately not real. One may escape the lesser kalpas, but when the kalpa ends, all must perish. Truly, the Dao is not yet complete, lacking true constancy, and the impure *qi* has not dissipated. The bodily form is temporarily firm but has not yet penetrated the true realm, so there is no power to summon the ten directions. "Administration" refers to the seven administrations.

A verse says:

Escaping the inconstant, one’s years may yet extend,
Yet still one remains but an immortal in illusion.
Scholars of shallow roots, be not lightly deluded—
Only through refining the body may one ascend the Nine Heavens.

To recite this chapter lightly brings calamity upon the self;
To honor it with reverence and offerings brings prosperity to one’s lineage,
Flourishing through the ages, bound to good causes,
Averting ten thousand disasters, with divine spirits guarding the gate.

This scripture is most sacred and wondrous,
Peerless upon the Jade Capital,
Liberating countless beings,
The root of all myriad Ways.
Its majestic and boundless model
Virtue so vast it cannot be surpassed.

If, in reciting or encountering it, one fails in solemn purity;
If one treats it as mere amusement,
Or the heart and mind are not single-minded,
Or its exposition is irregular,
Or it is transmitted without discernment—
All these are acts of disrespect.

For this scripture is treasured by the myriad heavens,
Most urgently liberating beings, concealing the sacred and preserving the true,
Emerging from death and entering life,
Dispelling misfortune and averting calamity,
Securing and safeguarding states and households—
All this arises from it.

If one recites it lightly, calamity befalls the self.
Such calamity is unending—
How can one not be warned?

Moreover, the practice of reverent offerings and veneration
Is established to guide those of lesser capacity,
Bringing prosperity and flourishing,
Bound to good causes,
Averting ten thousand disasters, with divine spirits in protection—
These are the common merits said to be universally attained through the scripture.

Its sacred and wondrous nature arises from the binding of primordial *qi*,
Ever gathering and dispersing.
Though great kalpas intersect and heaven and earth perish,
This text alone endures,
Majestic indeed—the great law of the myriad heavens.
Its virtue, when weighed, cannot be fully expressed.

The Jade Capital is the Jade Capital Mountain,
Atop the Great Luo Heaven,
Where golden towers and jade halls stand.
The true script and secret talismans fill its precincts,
And this scripture is peerless among them.

A Hymn declares:
The immortals transmit it in secret, mouth to mouth—
Do not dismiss it lightly with doubt or indifference.
All things transform with the mulberry fields and seas,
Yet this scripture alone strides through the Great Luo Heaven.

The Dao teaches: Whoever recites this scripture ten times,
All the heavens assemble,
And the souls of a hundred million ancestors—
Those suffering, benighted spirits—
Are immediately delivered,
Ascending to the Vermilion Palace.
Their refinement spans nine years,
Reborn through transformation,
Attaining the rank of the noble.
The term "ordinary" makes no distinction of high or low.

"Hundred million ancestors" refers to all those from the beginningless past,
Those who have taken form and received form,
The parents who nurtured you,
And the ancestors who came before.
When one recites this scripture,
The lords of all the heavens gather before them,
And all the lingering, bound souls—
The long-imprisoned, the lost—
Are delivered,
Ascending to the Vermilion Palace.

In the Cinnabar Heaven of the southern realm lies the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace,
Within which stands the Vermilion Mound Prefecture,
And within that, the Flowing Fire Court—
The place of refinement, transformation, and immortal deliverance.
Those among the living who attain transcendence
Pass through this palace,
Undergoing the Great Threefold Fires’ refinement,
Forging their turbid, impure forms.
The radiance of jade eyes refines their qi and essence;
Then, the Yellow Blossom Waters wash away the corpse-like form.
Only then do they ride the numinous embryo,
Following their karmic transformation to be reborn anew.

The standards of refinement and deliverance are threefold:
The superior student achieves deliverance in three years,
The middling in nine,
The lesser in twenty-four.
Yet by the power of reciting this scripture,
All ancestors of a hundred million generations
Attain the middling standard of transformation,
Reborn as the noble.
From nobility, they cultivate further,
Swiftly ascending and attaining deliverance.

Those who diligently study this scripture,
When their merit is complete and virtue perfected,
All become immortals,
Soaring to the Golden Gates,
Roaming and feasting in the Jade Capital.
The superior student who cultivates and recites this scripture
Is immediately delivered,
Ascending to the Southern Palace.
To cherish it without ceasing,
To hold it in mind without forgetting—
This is called "diligent study."
Those who diligently study this scripture
Cultivate the heart of the Numinous Treasure,
Practicing the deeds of deliverance.
When their merit is complete and virtue perfected,
They ascend with their ancestors to realize the Dao of immortality—
Thus it is said, "all."
They soar to the Golden Gates,
Pay homage to the Most High,
And wander and feast in the realm of the Jade Capital—
The realm of those who refine the Dao to perfection,
Attaining subtlety and transcending the common.

Those who cultivate do so through practice; those who recite do so through scripture. When cultivation and recitation are both perfected, merit is lofty and virtue weighty—thus they are not bound by limits but ascend directly to the Southern Cinnabar to receive refinement.

A eulogy says:
Hold fast to the essential heart of the Numinous Treasure,
Recite the scripture’s words with single-minded devotion.
When cultivation and recitation are both perfected, merit and virtue are great—
Instantly one becomes light and ascends as an immortal.

When mortals in the world receive and recite this scripture, they extend their years and lengthen their lifespan, and afterward all attain the Way of *shijie*. Their ethereal souls temporarily dissolve, bypassing the hells, and immediately regain their forms to roam the vast heavens. By the grace of past blessings and the thread of good causes, they are reborn into the human realm. Those who encounter this scripture when the true teaching flourishes, receive and recite it, and thereby attain long life—though after enjoying their worldly years, they cannot escape the decay of their forms. Yet even in death, their spirits do not perish; this is called *shijie*. Like Yang Wangsun, Ji Kang, and Guo Pu, they cast off their bodies to return to the real. Thus it is known that those who attain *shijie* have eyes like polished jade and bones as light as feathers; or their essence and blood remain unchanged, and when their corpses are cast into famous mountains and great rivers, pearls and jade may grow from them.

All who recite this scripture cultivate the heart of the Numinous Treasure and uphold the deeds of deliverance, thereby extending their years and ultimately attaining the Way of *shijie*. Their ethereal souls temporarily dissolve, no longer passing through the hells, and immediately regain their forms in the vast heavens. If one’s learning is shallow and merit slight, unable to ascend with both flesh and bones, one must attain *shijie* to return the spirit.

A eulogy says:
A hundred-year-old house cannot remain forever new—
When things transform and decline, they change their master.
When the cultivation of virtue is complete in a thousand days,
Right and wrong alike return to a heap of dust.

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. All heavenly and mortal beings receive its blessings, and immeasurable fortune extends to the living and the dead. Above, it dispels celestial disasters; below, it averts earthly calamities. Immeasurable fortune pervades life and death, and all receive its benefits. This treasure of heaven is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted offer gold and treasures, pledging their hearts in oaths to heaven before it is passed on. Those who lightly reveal or disdain it bring misfortune upon nine generations, condemned to eternal servitude under the ghost officials—like pushing waves or carrying stones to fill rivers.

A eulogy says:
The Primordial Beginning expounds profound meanings in humble words,
Each teaching delivered to save the people of heaven.
The human heart naturally creates its own prison—
Only by grasping and safeguarding this scroll of scripture can one be freed.

Five Emperors, along with twenty-four Jade Lads and Jade Maidens each, guard the sacred text and protect the bodies of those who receive the scripture. The Emperors of the Five Directions each dispatch twenty-four Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, totaling one hundred and twenty, to guard this scripture and protect the person.

The Dao says: During the long fast of the first month, recite this scripture to sever the earthly bonds of past souls and deliver them to the Southern Palace. During the long fast of the seventh month, recite this scripture to attain immortality, and the heavens will inscribe one’s name on the Yellow Register and White Slips, erasing death and recording life. During the long fast of the tenth month, recite this scripture to secure the throne for kings and emperors, harmonize rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, stabilize the nation’s destiny, and ensure the heavens endure forever—so that one may reign as sovereign generation after generation, bringing peace to the land and its people.

All the good deeds one performs bring blessings to nine generations; if one is already reborn in heaven, their fortune is increased. If not yet reborn in heaven, they ascend by the qi. Conversely, all evil deeds bring misfortune to seven generations, entangling descendants, and upon death, the person is consigned to the netherworld, their sins dragging the living into repeated cycles of retribution.

The first month marks the beginning of the four seasons, when heaven and earth are in harmony and all things are renewed. By observing a long fast and reciting the scripture during this time, one aligns with the celestial officials’ judgment, delivering past souls from the earthly bonds of suffering and ascending them to the Southern Palace. The seventh month is when all things reach fruition; by observing a long fast and reciting the scripture then, one aligns with the Mid-Yuan’s elevation of the good, thereby attaining immortality. The heavens inscribe one’s name on the Golden Register and White Slips, erasing the record of death and inscribing life—this is the path to immortality. One must first have the Northern and Southern Offices erase death and inscribe life before ascending; without this, success is impossible. The tenth month is a time of tranquility for heaven and earth; by observing a long fast and reciting the scripture then, one aligns with the Lower Yuan’s dissolution of karmic ties, thereby praying for blessings and averting disasters for the nation above and the people below. As the Orthodox Unity Perfected One said: One must work for the nation and the people, promoting benefit and eliminating harm, and only then serve the Three Realms without shame. This is the meaning.

Scholars who take this to heart practice the foundation of boundless deliverance. Unceasing mindfulness over time is called "long"; quiet contemplation, vigilance, and purity are called "fast"—hence the term "long fast."

A eulogy says:
On auspicious days and favorable hours, recite the scripture well,
Freeing the mind from worldly cares.
When the merit of aiding others and benefiting all is complete,
Names are recorded on jade slips and golden books.

On the days of the eight solar terms, recite this scripture to become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces.

On one’s natal day, reciting this scripture clarifies and rectifies the hun-soul, preserves the myriad qi eternally, averts suffering and affliction, and illumines the body with radiance. The Three Realms stand guard, the Five Emperors oversee the reception, and the ten thousand spirits come to pay homage. One’s name is inscribed in Heaven, and upon the fulfillment of merit and virtue, one ascends to the Shangqing realm.

On the days of *Lichun*, *Chunfen*, *Lixia*, *Xiazhi*, *Liqiu*, *Qiufen*, *Lidong*, and *Dongzhi*, the Great Unity Controller of Destiny, along with all subordinate officials, records the sins, blessings, merits, and transgressions of the world. Merit is rewarded, and transgressions are punished. Reciting this scripture on these days aligns one with the register of promotions, thus attaining the rank of Perfected One of the Nine Palaces.

On one’s natal day, the spirits of the body are invigorated, and the stellar officials of one’s original destiny compile records of merit and transgression, submitting them to the Northern Dipper. Reciting this scripture on this day thus clarifies and rectifies the hun-soul and perpetuates the myriad qi. When the myriad qi endure, suffering ceases; when suffering ceases, the divine radiance shines forth of itself. Thoughts in motion breed demonic influences, but when qi is settled, demons disperse. Therefore, the demon kings of the Three Realms stand guard and protect, shielding one from external disturbances.

Whenever one recites the scripture and engages in visualization, the bureaucratic spirits and deities emerge from the crown of the head; upon completion of the practice, they re-enter through the Gates of Myriad Wonders. Thus, the Five Emperors oversee their reception and departure. The ten thousand spirits gather to pay homage and inscribe one’s name in Heaven, awaiting the day when merit and virtue are complete, when one’s body and spirits ascend together to the Shangqing realm.

A eulogy says:
Should one claim that recitation makes one a Perfected One,
Doubt would arise, and few would heed.
Yet when qi is preserved and the spirit rectified,
The body shines with boundless radiance.

A collation states: *The Scripture and Methods of the Lingbao Pure Brightness for Delivering Humanity* was transmitted by the Perfected Lord Xu, the Grand Master of the Nine Provinces and Grand Astrologer of the Orthodox Unity. "Spirits undispersed" is called *Ling*; "qi converging at the origin" is called *Bao*; "not a speck of dust defiling" is called *Pure*; "illuminating even the darkest depths" is called *Brightness*. Those who receive this method are called "Loyal and Filial Disciples."

There are Ten Precepts:
1. **Do not forget the Eight Extremes.** Loyalty is the extreme of reverence; filial piety, the extreme of compliance; integrity, the extreme of purity; caution, the extreme of vigilance; magnanimity, the extreme of breadth; generosity, the extreme of joy; tolerance, the extreme of harmony; forbearance, the extreme of wisdom.
2. **Do not forget the Mirroring Waters.** The mirror symbolizes the mind; water symbolizes nature. When the mind is bright, all dharmas are illuminated; when nature is pure, the Five Turbidities do not adhere.
3. **Do not forget the Daily Record.** The daily record is for examining good and evil. Whatever one does in a day that cannot be written down is one’s own fault—rectification is paramount.
4. **Do not forget Pursuing Deliverance and Pacifying the Realm.** *Pursuing* means reciting scriptures and executing talismans to aid the deceased ancestors and six relations, providing for their journey in the netherworld. *Deliverance* means reciting scriptures and executing talismans to benefit the living ancestors and six relations, extending their fortune and lifespan. *Pacifying the Realm* means reciting scriptures and executing talismans to pray for the longevity of the king, emperor, and sage rulers, and to pacify the Four Quarters.
5. **Do not forget Healing and Relief.** In healing and relief, compassion is foremost. When others are ill, recite scriptures and execute talismans with utmost sincerity to dispel their afflictions, as if they were one’s own parents. In all matters, whether for men or women, extend kindness and grace to the fullest.
6. **Do not forget Ingesting and Refining.** The arts of ingestion and refinement emulate Heaven and Earth, modeling the patterns of yin and yang. With every thought sincere and true, and every visualization unbroken, one naturally transcends, transforming without limit.
7. **Do not forget Firmness and Purity.** Firmness entails steadfastness, refraining from impropriety and excess. Purity entails avoiding defilement, not coveting improper food. Refraining from excess preserves the spirit and essence of the body; abstaining from improper food spares the lives of beings.
8. **Do not forget Frugality and Restraint.** In all clothing, possessions, and food, remember that all things are born of the primordial qi of the Original Beginning. Wash away filth with lye and water, and do not adorn oneself excessively. Let coarse grains and wheat suffice for sustenance; do not indulge in delicacies.
9. **Do not forget Vows and Pledges.** *Vows* are the aspirations made upon first entering the Dao; *pledges* are the oaths sworn upon first entering the Dao. Heaven and Earth’s spirits and deities oversee them—do not rashly alter them midway. The statutes of the Cavernous Spirits must be observed with care.
10. **Do not forget Teachers and Friends.** Teachers instruct; friends admonish. Those who teach you are like fathers; those who admonish you are like elder brothers. How could one not revere and cherish them, casting them aside?

It is further said that those who attain this method may ascend in flight, transcend the world, or achieve liberation through *shijie*. The key lies in observing the mind—only when the mind is absent does the true mind appear. Observe the form—only when form is absent does the true form appear. When both mind and form are absent, the eyes enter the formless Dao, achieving great stillness. The divine radiance becomes serene, and the Jade Clarity realm is revealed—this is the method of flying ascent.

According to *The Chapter on Recognizing the Spirit for Ascending as a Perfected One*: Those who study the Dao and transcend to Perfection ride clouds in flight, and celestial scriptures descend. Immortal officials receive them. Who are these immortal officials? The various Perfected Ones in paired-dragon chariots, with forceful warriors bearing banners, clearing the way before and guarding behind. Mighty Heavenly Soldiers, Jade Lads and Jade Maidens hold ribbons and seals, while silver-eared minor officials transmit the Emperor’s command. At this moment, there is no fear, no alarm—naturally, the hun and po undergo refinement in the Vermilion Mound. The great generals of the Vermilion Mound wield flowing gold and fire bells, entering the celestial realm. Heaven has four gates. At the Eastern Florescence Gate, the gate officials preside, with a sovereign within—this is the Day-Duty Primordial Lord. There is a chief recording deity, a gatekeeper, and three Perfected Immortals who are Vajra Warriors. They inquire after your name, examine your transgressions, and assess your merits. Only when your records are accurate and without error may you enter. Two recording officials then guide you upward. The True Lords of the Southern and Northern Dippers receive you, and the recording officials withdraw. The True Lords then present your case in order to the Purple Tenuity Court.

At this moment, the Dao of immortality is accomplished. Bowing in reverence to the Great Luo, the Primordial Origin, the Jade Purity, and the August Jade Emperor of the Three Realms. The Heavenly Venerable cannot be seen—only auspicious clouds are beheld. Jade lads transmit the decree, their voices faintly audible, bestowing upon you elixirs, golden pendants, and pearl tassels. Should you receive these, prostrate yourself in worship and dance with joy, for true immortals will instruct you in the rites of audience.

This scripture is truly wondrous, and thus its essence is spoken in brief. Let your mind dwell upon it, and take care not to err. With every recitation of this true scripture, you shall ascend to heavenly rank.

There is also the *Chapter on Shallow Practice and Corpse Liberation*, which states: Those of shallow cultivation in the Dao may attain immortality through corpse liberation. Before death arrives, there must be good affinity. When the kalpas of dust are exhausted, the Eastern Marchmount strikes your name from its register, and the Western Marchmount removes your dossier. The Divine Lord Du commands two messengers to pursue and guide your hun and shen.

At this hour, recall your karmic causes. When you stand before the courts of the underworld officials, with their punishments and prisons—terrifying and alarming—do not fear. State your case directly, recounting the circumstances without concealment or deceit. If your evil ledger bears no name and your virtuous register records your deeds, the True Person of the Eastern Ultimate Who Saves from Suffering, hearing your righteous words, will welcome you with joy and ascend with you in a jade carriage drawn by four wheels. The attending deities on left and right are as in the ascension of the perfected. Know their surnames, know their names.

They escort your spirit to be refined in the Vermilion Mound, ascending step by step through the ranks, carefree in the Upper Clarity. At the Gate of Heaven, you enter the Purple Tenuity Court. Some receive elixirs, some true scriptures—jade lads transmit the decrees, just as in the flight of ascension.

Your bones and flesh remain behind, a discarded form, like the molted husk of a cicada, foul and putrid. Your descendants, burying you with utmost sincerity, shall also ascend the ladder of immortality by the grace of your lineage. The ladder of immortality lies before their eyes, yet people remain unaware. Thus it is appended here.

The foolish one further ventures to discuss: The Most Perfected Lord Xu of the Capital Immortals, through this supreme and wondrous scripture, expounded the *Lingbao Jingfa of Purity and Clarity*. Yet the two characters "purity and clarity" cannot be likened even to the vast emptiness of the heavens or the sun and moon. The *Collected Works of Master Chao Wenyuan* states: "The Confucian classics speak of purity and clarity residing in the body, where aspiration and qi become spirit-like." *Zhuangzi* says: "Water, when pure, is bright—how much more so the spirit? The heart of the sage is pure indeed." The Buddha Universal Light, for the sake of Endless Intention, taught the *Samadhi of Purity and Clarity*, free from all afflictions, its nature like empty space, unstained by defilement. Originally without a single thing, it is the essence of primordial emptiness—purity in its ultimate. Stillness and illumination embrace the void, revealing the function of emptiness—clarity in its ultimate. As the vast heavens are pure and the sun and moon are bright, without perceiving the heart of purity and clarity, this principle reaches its apex, and thus not a single dharma can be attained. "Illuminating darkness like a blazing torch, emptying the self like a purified palace"—these words, uttered by the sages of the Three Teachings to elucidate the subtlety of these two characters, align with the scripture’s passages on "even and level as one" and "without distinction," where no hierarchy remains. Above, all is azure jade, without any other hue, and the verse on "hanging pearls silent without lingering echoes"—their purport is the same. Thus, they are appended here again.

The Dao declares: On the day of practicing the Way, one must bathe in fragrant water, fast, and purify oneself. Entering the chamber, face east, knock the teeth thirty-two times to ascend through the thirty-two heavens, and bow in the heart thirty-two times. Close the eyes and meditate, sitting amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, inwardly and outwardly shrouded in darkness. Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane array themselves to left and right. Sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber within, while a circular image arises from the crown, its radiance suffusing the ten directions. All is vividly clear.

The secret incantation says:

"Tānluó Yùluó, seal without Suddha.
Supreme Harmony, Supreme Ultimate—yin and yang embrace in harmony.
Emerging from existence, entering non-existence, ghosts and spirits cannot fathom.
Exiting death, entering life, transformations arise naturally.
Primal Chaos of Original Qi, mystery within mystery.
Above, it reaches the Heavenly Summit; below, it penetrates the Great Abyss.
Recite once through, and even chronic ailments heal of themselves.
Refine the hun-soul, nurture the po-soul, true yang is preserved whole.
With fasting, rites, and recitation, ten thousand repetitions ascend as an immortal.
The supreme secret incantation, ten thousand spirits endure unbroken.
The heart’s core incantation, proclaimed again and again:
Tānluó illumines profoundly, merging with the Dao in truth.
Jade Purity’s Supreme Pole, Brahma-qi billows in mist.
Dispersing numinous spirits, distributing qi, descending to infuse this servant’s body.
Form and spirit both wondrous, transforming and ascending in flight.
All as decreed, governing the ten thousand spirits.
Hasten! As decreed by the Original Supreme Lord of the Mysterious Capital’s statutes.

The Most High Mysterious Primordial Supreme Dao Lord summons forth from this servant’s body:
The Three and Five Merit Officers, left and right official messengers,
Incense-bearing Golden Lads, message-transmitting Jade Maidens,
and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, Direct Day Incense Officers—thirty-two each—
to open and transmit these words.
Today is auspicious, a long fast in the pure hall, cultivating the supreme scripture.
This servant petitions on behalf of so-and-so, wishing that what is declared may ascend directly to the presence of the Most High Original Supreme Lord before the Thirty-Two Heavens’ throne.

There are two kinds of practicing the Way:
Burning incense and reciting scriptures, pacing the void in homage and praise—this is called practicing the Way;
Refining body and mind, upholding virtue and power—this too is called practicing the Way.

Bathing: *mu* means washing the hair; *yu* means washing the body.
There are also two methods:
Using five-fragrance water with incantations to wash the body—this is external bathing;
Greatly circulating Brahma-qi through the ten directions, reaching the central harmony of the five qi, blending with the hundred spirits—this is internal bathing.

Fasting: It is not merely abstaining from impure foods, meat, and lust, but also aligning the mind to prevent calamity, and restraining the nature to eliminate wrongdoing.
Entering the chamber means entering stillness, free from dust, with body and mind wholly focused, so as to commune with the divine.
Facing east is the direction of long life, summoning true qi, with life as the foundation.

The method of knocking the teeth:
The left is the Heavenly Bell, the right is the Heavenly Chime—summoning immortals and spirits.
The center is the Heavenly Drum—paying homage to the supreme sages.
Heart-bowing means the body remains unmoving, the mind wholly intent on reverence.
Closing the eyes means withdrawing vision to inwardly observe, so qi congeals in stillness.

Green is the qi of the Mysterious One,
Yellow is the qi of the Primordial One,
White is the qi of the Original One.
The meaning of the three colors is drawn from the Three Pure Ones.
Sitting in meditation, the divine luminaries appear of themselves.

Thus, the inner realm is bright, the outer realm is bright,
Merging in profound darkness—this is called "verdant obscurity."
Next, visualize the Green Dragon emerging from the liver, stationed to the left;
The White Tiger emerging from the lungs, stationed to the right;
The Vermilion Bird emerging from the heart, stationed in front;
The Dark Warrior emerging from the kidneys, stationed behind.
The Lion and White Crane, each visualized in sixfold formation, emerge from the six viscera, stationed to left and right, front and back.

The left eye transforms into the solar orb, manifesting nine layers of purple-red light;
The right eye transforms into the lunar orb, manifesting ten layers of yellow-white light.
Nine feet distant from the body, their radiance blazes brilliantly,
Shining into the nostrils, passing through the brain’s rear, entering the Golden Flower Palace,
Congealing into a wheel-like halo of light.
Previously, the green, yellow, and white colors were distinct—now they form a nine-colored circular image.
With this radiance pervading the ten directions of the world,
Then, in subtle tones, visualize the divine scribes emerging from the crown, arrayed before you.
State your vows and prayers, then visualize the Thirty-Two Heavens one by one, drawing in their qi and swallowing it to completion.

A verse says:
Closing the eyes, observe the body in fine detail,
In concentration, another universe unfolds.
The circular light appears, immortals gather—
Ask yourself: Who is the Original Supreme?

*Commentary on the Supreme Original Vastly Saving Humankind’s Upper Chapter of Wondrous Scripture* concludes.

*Commentary on the Supreme Original Vastly Saving Humankind’s Middle Chapter of Wondrous Scripture*

The Original is the root of the ten thousand things, standing at the head of the great image,
Vast and boundless, its subtle light endures, its transformations inexhaustible.
If one can deepen the root and secure the stem, one abides with Heaven for eternity.

A verse says:
To realize one’s root and origin, the truth is sought,
Iron sandals worn thin, the form wearies in vain.
Foolish children cling to their dwellings for a thousand years—
Only today do they recognize the true Master.

The Original is the reckoning of the indistinct, in the infinitesimal’s inception, before all transformations;
The ten thousand things arise from the Original, return to the end,
And cycle back to the Original.
The meaning of the Original is profound, uniquely revered,
Yet through change and flux, form and substance emerge.

A verse says:
Once foolish and ignorant, unaware of the worthy,
Drawn into the world’s entanglements by you.
The resolute man ultimately sees through it—
Coming and going freely, without clinging.

Non-existence is existence; existence is non-existence.
Non-existence and existence are the Dao’s root.
Approaching it, its beginning is unseen; following it, its end is unseen—
Hidden yet silently present.

A verse says:
Within the indistinct, wondrous functions abound,
Therein the true form takes shape.
No need to seek beyond the realm—
Who else could blend with the misty qi of all things?

Measure is the Dao’s function, inexhaustible in its extremity.
Heaven’s number is one, Earth’s number is two, the ten thousand things’ number is three.
One, two, three—though the myriad things’ supreme forms differ,
They all return to the One. Taking this as measure is called "immeasurable."

A verse says:
Gazing from on high, how many leagues are seen?
Boundless and infinite, profoundly obscure.
Looking up and down, the vastness of Heaven and Earth unknown—
One must embrace and unify the true.

Salvation: The Dao has no form, yet by containing light, it establishes humanity;
It has no root, yet transforms the false into the true.
The Original One transforms to generate spirit,
Spirit transforms to generate the true,
The true transforms to generate the Dao."

Things borrow things to complete things; humans borrow the true to complete the Dao.
Recognizing things while guarding the true—this is called "salvation."

A verse says:
The earthen and wooden form is ultimately empty,
Within the shadow of ignorance, chasing the vast chaos.
One must rely on extraordinary arts beyond things,
Only then can one soar free from the cage of the world.

The human is the subtle inquiry into the profound and indistinct;
the human exists within it.
Vague and indistinct, spirit is born in fire;
profound and obscure, essence is born in water.
Fire flames upward, seven transformations make spirit;
water flows downward, six transformations make essence.
The seven and six transformations, above and below completing each other,
spirit and essence intermingling, the wondrous body contains the true.
Each true to its truth—this is called the "true person."

A verse says:
This body is originally of incomparable worth,
Originally serene and still, connecting heaven and earth.
Creation relies solely on yin and yang,
Earth, water, fire, and wind are all impurities.

The highest is the Dao’s subtlety.
Swallowing the red, absorbing the yellow, inhaling the blue-green, ingesting the white,
gathering the primordial in the primordial palace, giving birth to spirit and form.
Then, abandoning the ten thousand things, forsaking the ten thousand transformations,
alone attaining the mysterious—this is called "the highest of the high."

A verse says:
Three hundred merits achieved, ten thousand practices wondrous,
Amid the dust, seizing the prize and returning.
The Jade Terrace has already inscribed your name,
Only then does a man’s ambition show no baseness.

Rank: recognizing the many while observing the One,
guarding the One and embracing the One,
returning to our utmost One—this is called "rank."
The Dao is originally formless; how could words have rank?
For expedient teaching, ranks are thus established.

A verse says:
Three thousand six hundred dharma gates are many,
One must clearly recognize the correct one.
The great Dao does not expect a thousand days to complete;
do not let the years and months pass in vain.

The wondrous is the origin of the ten thousand methods.
Thus, heaven and earth are empty and wondrous yet clear;
yin and yang share the wondrous and are pure;
the sun and moon unite in the wondrous and are bright;
the five phases contain the wondrous and are refined;
the ten thousand things are all wondrous and true.
The wondrous gaze sees the formless form;
the wondrous hearing hears the soundless sound.
Not to be seen, not to be heard, not to be had, not to be without—
this is called true wondrousness.

A verse says:
Neither non-being nor being, originally pure and true,
Neither form nor sound, beyond all comparison.
Where depiction and description cannot reach,
In the profound, the position and image are most distinct.

The scripture is the warp and weft of heaven and earth;
the sun and moon move, day and night unceasing,
endlessly cycling, transforming without exhaustion.
The ancients, looking up and down, necessarily relied on the Dao,
not transgressing the path, not losing constancy,
not losing their essence through external things—
this is the root of the scripture.

A verse says:
Counting on fingers, the master’s compassionate vow,
The black pearl is not idly cast aside.
Clearly pointing to the immortal’s path for me,
Repay the profound grace of the mountains and peaks without fail.

**Eulogy for "Original Beginning"**
Before the great image, forcibly named "Original,"
Ancestor of heaven and earth, source of the ten thousand things.
After the Three Powers divided, a beginning could be spoken;
humans know to return, ultimately reverting to their root.
True emptiness, luminous illumination, before kalpas.

**Eulogy for "Boundless"**
Before form existed, the Dao was truly here,
Its name unknown, thus called "without";
Unfathomable, who could probe or perceive?
Taking this as measure, its measure cannot be reckoned;
Mysterious and again mysterious, those who awaken return together.

**Eulogy for "Salvation of Humans"**
Once form exists, transformation begins here;
What causes transformation, if not the Dao?
Transforming the false into true, decay into wonder.
Among the multitude, why be uniquely different?
Shedding the mortal to enter the sacred, merging with the subtle and rare.

**Eulogy for "Supreme Rank"**
Its height unknown, thus called "supreme";
A thing formed in chaos, before heaven and earth.
Looking up from below, who stands before it?
Taking this as rank, how could words suffice to declare!
Among all peers, uniquely transcendent and surpassing.

**Eulogy for "Wondrous Scripture"**
The morning sun rises in the east, the night moon hangs in the sky,
Jade emerges from uncut stone, pearls appear in oyster shells.
The most precious is the Dao; how could the wondrous be exhausted?
Spreading forth as scripture, eternally constant and unchanging,
Heaven and earth have kalpas, the wondrous scripture has no end.

**Chapter on the Original Beginning Expounding the Dao and Universally Salvation**
Expounding the Dao and virtue, enlightening humans and heavens,
Governing the three realms—this is called "universal."
*Collation:* The scripture contains Daoist words; these two chapters serve as their banner,
and the *Qingyuan Zhenren Scripture Commentary* uses this to represent one of the two chapters.

Establishing images to initiate cultivation, four hundred fifty-seven words.
Ordinary beings, their nature obscured, turn from their root and lose the true,
thus first establishing image-methods to open the path,
as the root of the Dao.
*Collation:* The *Preface to the Qingyuan Scripture Commentary* by the Old Man of Qinghe says:
"Divided into eight matters"—this is one of those eight.

The Original Beginning, cavernously mysterious,
the root chapter of the Numinous Treasure,
supreme wondrous head,
ten cycles of salvation,
hundred demons hidden in rhyme,
naturally converging and diverging.
This is the original intent of the *Scripture of the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign*,
speaking of the Heavenly Worthy containing the vast and wondrous Dao,
endowed with spontaneity,
covering the ten thousand ranks,
most honored and most noble,
penetratingly observing the mysterious One,
transforming and saving humans and heavens—
thus called the *Cavernously Mysterious Original Beginning*.
With great wisdom and luminous brilliance, it illuminates the ten directions of the world.
In heaven, it is called "numinous"; in the world, it is called "treasure"—
thus called *Numinous Treasure*.
All spoken from the golden mouth, thus called the "root chapter,"
fully containing the root of cultivating the true and uniting with the Dao.
Its rank is supreme, the head of all wonders,
secretly concealing the taboo names of demonic truths.
Converging with primordial qi to congeal,
dispersing as qi, converging as script,
this is the Dao of transformation and fluctuation,
not to be compared to ink traces,
the ancestor of the ten thousand methods,
the honored one of the Three Caverns.
The wise recognize it and cultivate to complete the treasure.
The *Yellow Court Scripture* says:
"The Dao of nurturing life is not troublesome;
ancestral cultivation is the *Cavernous Mystery* and the *Jade Chapters*."

This is what is meant.

The ode says:
To know the Primordial Beginning’s method of delivering beings,
the *Numinous Treasure* was originally called the "root chapter."
Within it lie the hundred demons—who can comprehend?
If one can part and merge, radiance arises naturally.

The *Crimson Writ of Primal Chaos*, the Supreme Truth of Non-Being,
the Primordial Beginning of the Ancestral Kalpa,
transforms and gives birth to all heavens.
Illuminating the Three Luminaries,
this is the root of heaven,
above which there is no further ancestor—
only the Dao as its body.
The Five Scripts unfold and expand,
universally planting the divine spirits.

*Primal Chaos* is the state before heaven and earth divided.
Before the Primordial Beginning,
its qi was pure and crimson,
wind and marsh intermingling—
this is the *Great Cavern*.
When script first took form,
only the Heavenly Worthy stood solitary in serene independence,
abiding in the supreme of Non-Being,
attaining the utmost truth within truth—
thus called the *Supreme Truth of Non-Being*.
The *Primordial Beginning of the Ancestral Kalpa*
is the lesser kalpa of *Dragon Han*, called *Yan Kang*.
First, one qi gave birth to three qi,
forming the Three Pure Realms above;
the three qi gave birth to nine qi,
completing the Nine Heavens.
Beyond the Nine Heavens lie the Thirty-Two Heavens—
thus are all heavens transformed and born.
Then the sun, moon, and stars were arrayed,
governing the ten thousand things—
this is the illumination of the Three Luminaries,
the image of heaven and earth,
yet it does not escape the workings of change and transformation.

The Heavenly Worthy, containing the beginning of *Primal Chaos*,
generated the true qi of the Five Phases,
condensing them into talismanic scripts
to pacify and stabilize heaven and earth,
giving birth to and transforming divine spirits,
abiding in the Three Realms
to govern the ten thousand methods.
Thus, they hang without falling,
enduring without decay.
From these Five Scripts were unfolded the five thousand characters,
fully containing the root of the wondrous, primordial, divine, and true Dao,
corresponding above to the Five Phases—
the origin of all transformation.

Like a person before form,
where does the spirit reside?
Chaotic and undifferentiated,
dense and obscure,
without division or distinction,
neither existent nor non-existent—
Non-Being is called the Dao,
the Dao is the root of humanity.
When this Dao scatters,
it becomes simplicity.
Simplicity scatters into qi,
qi congeals to form spirit,
and when spirit is complete,
form arises.
This is the original source of humanity,
its primordial beginning.

Then the Three Fields are arrayed,
the Nine Orifices opened,
the Five Viscera and Six Bowels formed—
the image of all heavens transformed and born.
The *Three Fields* are the convergence of essence and blood,
the root and origin of the ten thousand qi.
This is the illumination of the Three Luminaries,
the foundation of yin and yang in the body,
the root of nourishment and defense.

Though a person’s life begins in the womb,
its origin arises from the beginning of the Primordial Beginning.
Who is ancestor? Who is lineage?
Receiving the Dao’s qi as substance,
borrowing essence and blood as form,
dwelling within to accomplish transformation—
this is how it is.
When the Five Spirits are arrayed,
then the thirty-six thousand joints
simultaneously generate spirit from their root and origin.
Is this not the universal planting of divine spirits?

Thus, the Dao is not far from humanity.
If one awakens and cultivates,
one may ascend as an immortal.
The foolish, clinging to delusion,
fail to honor their qi,
value their root,
preserve their life,
or secure their form—
they bring about their own decay and death,
severing their original truth.
Thus, they distance themselves from the Dao.

The ode says:

The supreme truth stands beyond the formless,
originating in the Dragon Han, enduring to this day.
Neither increasing nor diminishing, ever pure and still—
this is called the Great Dharmakāya.

Without script, no radiance;
without script, no illumination;
without script, no establishment;
without script, no completion;
without script, no deliverance;
without script, no generation.

When the Great Simplicity scattered, Heaven and Earth divided;
when the numinous script coalesced, the Jade Characters emerged.
Thereafter, the myriad forms gained light,
the myriad forms unfolded in clarity,
the myriad dharmas were firmly established,
the myriad things self-completed,
the myriad spirits received deliverance,
and the myriad kinds were born.
Had the primordial qi not divided and the Five Scripts not taken form,
how could generation and completion have come to be?

As with human birth—
were it not for the Dao’s qi descending to nourish with true numen,
opening and transforming,
how could this illusory, colored body stand firm?

The ode says:
The Numinous Treasure’s light first revealed,
its splendor resplendent, timeless and bright.
It stabilizes Heaven, anchors Earth, manifests creation—
not mere words upon paper.

This is the Great Brahmā,
the Heaven within Heaven,
the Yu Luo Xiao Terrace,
the Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital.
Supreme beyond the supreme,
the Great Net of Jade Purity,
boundless and measureless,
now present, now absent—
the Three Flowers depart, the wondrous court of Great Existence,
golden palaces and jade chambers,
a forest of purity and clarity.

The Great Brahmā qi circulates through the ten directions.
Within it dwell the immortal-delivering spirits,
the Southern Culmen’s Lord of Longevity,
the world-delivering Marshal of the Controller of Horses,
the life-cherishing Lord Han the Venerable,
the Southern Supernal Lords of Destiny and Records,
who extend life and augment fate,
the revered spirits who deliver from calamity,
who restore bones and raise the dead—
boundless deliverance of beings.

Today, as the register is reviewed,
the myriad heavens descend to the imperial terrace.

From the formless and beyond, all are called Brahmā Heavens.
This "Great Brahmā" refers to the first coagulation of the Dao’s qi.
The "Heaven within Heaven" is the sacred realm of the Three Purities and Great Net.
"Great" means covering the myriad heavens;
"Net" means encompassing the Three Realms.
Supreme beyond the supreme, thus it is called the Great Net.
Within it stands the Jade Capital Mountain,
eighty thousand leagues in circumference,
opposite Kunlun below.
The mountain bears the Yu Luo Xiao Terrace,
the terrace holds a seven-jeweled city,
the city contains the Jade Purity Hall,
where the Heavenly Worthy resides.

"Supreme" refers to the boundless.
Vast and unfathomable,
only the highest immortals perceive it;
middle and lower immortals cannot glimpse it.
Its height spans immeasurable leagues,
now appearing, now vanishing—
thus it is said to be now present, now absent,
the ebb and flow of the Primordial Beginning.

There is also the Palace of the Three Flowers Departed,
the court of Great Existence—
both places of repose.
When the Heavenly Emperors of the myriad heavens convene,
they must circumambulate thrice while chanting void-steps,
only then do they behold the Jade Countenance.

Golden palaces and jade chambers,
jade pools and emerald waters,
stand in solemn array.
Sustained by the ceaseless circulation of Brahmā qi,
they endure eternally.

Within this palace dwells the immortal-delivering spirit,
a manifestation of the Primordial Beginning.
The Lord of Longevity is the Great Emperor of Vermilion Mound,
who governs the Supreme Subtlety Enclosure,
overseeing the alchemy of fire.
The world-delivering Lord presides over the cycles of ninety-six solar phases.
The Marshal of the Controller of Horses dispels evil and averts trials.
The life-cherishing Lord is another name for Azure Radiance,
who oversees the evaluation of merits.
Lord Han governs Nanchang,
ranking and assessing practitioners.

The Lords of Destiny and Records govern merit and transgression,
bestowing or withholding, extending life and augmenting fate.
The spirits of deliverance from calamity resolve and pacify hardships.
The Lord of Restoring Bones and Raising the Dead ascends and delivers the dead,
causing flying corpses to ascend at dawn.

When the Heavenly Worthy expounds the Dao,
all are summoned to attend the imperial terrace,
reviewing registers and examining records,
ranking and delivering practitioners.

The human body, precious as the seven jewels,
is no different from the Jade Capital.
The brain palace is the Yu Luo Terrace,
golden palaces and jade chambers,
a forest of purity and clarity,
arrayed in profound stillness.
The immortal-delivering spirit resides within.
If the Brahmā qi circulates without cease,
it is like Heaven’s unceasing revolution—
enduring without decay.

The ode says:
Brahmā qi circulates through the ten directions,
the Jade Capital and golden palaces radiant in splendor.
With dispassionate inward contemplation,
the Three Purity realms are all the land of long life and immortality.

The collation states:
The scripture speaks of the transformation of the myriad heavens,
and of the "Great Brahmā Heaven within Heaven,"
extending to the Great Net of Jade Purity.
The commentary has already clarified this in a separate record.

It also lists the Nine Heavens, Nine Empyreans,
and the names of the Brahmā qi heavens and empyreans,
which are appended here:

First Green Heaven, paired with Grand Empyrean’s Radiant Flowing Light and Plain Effulgence Heaven;
Azure Origin Heaven, paired with Azure Empyrean’s Primordial True Treasure Radiance Heaven;
First Vermilion Heaven, paired with Vermilion Empyrean’s General Life-Opening Numinous Transmission Heaven;
Grand Vermilion Heaven, paired with Crimson Empyrean’s Great Peace Response and Transformation Dao Lord Heaven;
First Plain Heaven, paired with Scenic Empyrean’s Central Culmen’s Supreme Wondrous Transformation Void Heaven;
Grand Plain Heaven, paired with Jade Empyrean’s Luminous Primordial Majestic Virtue and Radiant Crystal Heaven;
First Mysterious Heaven, paired with Jade Empyrean’s Flying Azure Origin and Vast Salvation Heaven;
Grand Mysterious Heaven, paired with Purple Empyrean’s Conjoined Effulgence and Double Pass Transformation Body Heaven within Heaven;
Pure Tenuity Heaven, paired with Divine Empyrean’s Jade Purity Wondrous Realm,
governing the Nine Empyreans and Brahmā qi below.

Another version of the commentary includes diagrams of the Three Heavens, Nine Heavens, and Thirty-Two Heavens,
attached to the "Chapter on Generating the Spirit."
The Nine Heavens lie below the Three Heavens and above the Thirty-Two Heavens.

First: Yu Shan’s Immeasurable Heaven, in the south;
Second: Supreme Meditation’s Good and Immeasurable Longevity Heaven, in the northwest;
Third: Brahmā Supervisor’s Xu Yan Heaven, in the east;
Fourth: Silent and Tranquil Dou Shu Heaven, in the southwest;
Fifth: Pāramitā’s Unconceited Joy Heaven, in the southeast;
Sixth: Resonant Transformation Heaven, in the north;
Seventh: Numinous Transformation’s Brahmā Assistant Heaven, in the west;
Eighth: Lofty Void’s Pure Clarity Heaven, in the northeast;

Ninth: Non-Thought, Non-Attachment, Non-Desire Heaven, in the north, also called Pali Heaven. These Nine Heavens are all of Brahmā qi, and are also alternate names for the Primordial Azure Heaven and the Great Empyrean and other heavens, all appended here for reference.

In the eastern direction: Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Longevity Great Sage, Immeasurable Deliverer of Beings.
In the southern direction: Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Longevity Great Sage, Immeasurable Deliverer of Beings.
In the western direction: Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Longevity Great Sage, Immeasurable Deliverer of Beings.
In the northern direction: Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Longevity Great Sage, Immeasurable Deliverer of Beings.
In the northeastern direction: Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Longevity Great Sage, Immeasurable Deliverer of Beings.
In the southeastern direction: Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Longevity Great Sage, Immeasurable Deliverer of Beings.
In the southwestern direction: Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Longevity Great Sage, Immeasurable Deliverer of Beings.
In the northwestern direction: Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Longevity Great Sage, Immeasurable Deliverer of Beings.
Above: Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Longevity Great Sage, Immeasurable Deliverer of Beings.
Below: Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Longevity Great Sage, Immeasurable Deliverer of Beings.

Beginning from the east and extending through the ten directions, the Dao qi divides its forms, its wonders unfathomable. These are the honorific titles of the Flying Heavenly Great Sage, Limitless Divine Kings. The Divine Kings succeed the Primordial Beginning and are born; since before the Dragon Han kalpa, when the Primordial Beginning first spread transformation, these deities were first established to grasp and uphold the heavenly qi, to oversee and encompass the heavenly immortals, to govern life and death, to thoroughly regulate the tally of yin, and to protect the myriad people. Whenever a kalpic cycle ends, the Divine Kings mold and refine the cultivators, conducting the work of recommending and promoting them; all standards for ascent and descent are entirely under their charge.

The ode says:
The Dharmakāya is originally without distinct form,
Yet manifests in the ten directions, fundamentally the same.
Only because the Great Sage can attain longevity,
Does the deliverance of beings become boundlessly immeasurable.

The perfected of the ten directions, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Longevity Deliverers of the World, Immeasurable Great Spirits, all ride upon flying clouds, cinnabar chariots and green palanquins, feathered canopies and jade wheels, drawn by crimson phoenixes and five-colored dark dragons, bearing nine-colored standards and ten mystic pennants. Ahead, nine phoenixes cry in unison; behind, eight luan-birds sing in harmony. Lions and white cranes chant and sing in concord, while the Five Elders clear the path and the host of immortals flank the procession. With a hundred thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, they arrive through the void, turning their radiant carriages to oversee the deliverance of the true and the salvation of the living. The chariots, wheels, and canopies are all formed from the qi of yang essence; the phoenixes, dragons, and cranes are transformations of the qi of yin essence. The supremely sagely, possessing the Dao of true constancy, can gather and disperse their breath at will, manifesting as they please. The harmonious qi of yin and yang forms songs and melodies, all the work of pure truth, not of external things. If one can cultivate and refine the numinous treasure within, banishing all yin demons and assembling the yang spirit, one will meet at the palace of refined truth. With a single exhalation of primordial qi, the myriad spirits all heed; the spirits of the five viscera each manifest in their directional colors, and chariots, palanquins, and attendants come to welcome. Then the hundred bones and host of spirits, leading and following, ascend to pay homage to the origin—no different from this.

The ode says:
The splendid and profuse divine retinue is of unmatched nobility,
Yet the blended reed-pipe songs all form no discord.
Who brings about this scene of splendor?
In truth, it is none other than one’s own self.

One hundred fifty-eight words on delivering from life and death. Earlier, symbols were established to encourage the cultivation of truth; now, the salvation of the living and deliverance from death shall be carried out to manifest the work of universal deliverance.

Collated and noted: This is the second of eight sections in the Azure Primordial’s annotated sutra.

The chancellors of the various heavens, the Divine Overseer of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Han Controller of Records, and the Great Spirit Who Supervises Birth, holding registers and ledgers, all assemble before the Emperor. According to those who ought to be delivered, they strictly examine the various heavens. Each of the Thirty-Two Heavens has its own chancellor, who assists the celestial sovereign and serves as the office that records and maintains the ledgers. The Southern Prosperity is the Cinnabar Heaven realm and the Vermilion Numinous Fire Mansion, the place where cultivators are transformed and refined after their transition. The Han Controller is the scribe within the palace, responsible for the records of refinement and deliverance. The Supervisor of Birth is another name for the one who forges the hun-soul and po-soul, overseeing rebirth. Moved by the vow-power of the Heavenly Worthy, each holds their registers and ledgers, assembling before the Emperor to examine those who ought to receive deliverance: some by their innate names in the mysterious charts, their bone configurations matching those of immortals; some by their cultivation of fasts and observance of precepts, their accumulated merit and virtue moving the heavens; some by their reverence for the Three Treasures, their good works penetrating the heavens; or by their offerings to the Teacher-Treasure, recorded by the Three Officials. Those whose names are proclaimed in the various heavens are each strictly examined and assessed, then promoted and delivered according to the measure of their merit.

The ode says:
The summoning of the various heavens to assemble in the imperial court—
For what reason are these meticulous examinations and records made?
Those in the world who accumulate goodness and amass great merit
Will have the refining and deliverance of the Southern Prosperity.

A universal announcement to the Three Realms, the Limitless Divine Regions, the Yellow Springs and Crooked Springs Mansion, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, and the Twelve River Sources: may the karmic debts of ancestors and parents from a hundred kalpas be absolved, their ledgers of transgressions expunged, their evil roots eradicated. They must not be detained or coerced into joining the ghostly multitudes; by the talismanic command of the Primordial Beginning, they shall be promoted and transferred at the appointed hour.

The Three Realms are Heaven, Earth, and Water. The Limitless Divine Regions encompass all the divine courts and shrines within the Three Realms. The Yellow Springs and Crooked Springs lie at the lowest depths of the northern abyss, serving as the key repository for the rivers and seas, where the ledgers of sinful souls are stored. The Northern Capital of Fengdu: beyond the heavens formed by the ascending pure qi, the congealing of turbid qi gives rise to this mountain, located in the north of the cosmos. The mountain stands five hundred fifty-five thousand five hundred li high, with a circumference of thirty thousand li. Its summit reaches the azure vault, and its base touches the wind and springs; the black and murky qi coils about it. Within the mountain are the six celestial cavern-palaces: first, the Palace of the Yin of Utter Destruction; second, the Palace of the Sect of Truthful Punishment; third, the Palace of the City of Martial Endurance; fourth, the Palace of the Qi of Sinful Calm; fifth, the Palace of the Seven Transgressions of the Ancestral Numen; sixth, the Palace of the Daring Controller of the Winding Abyss. Each palace is governed by a great demon king, who serves as the overarching authority of the Three Primes and the central office of the Five Marchmounts.

Moreover, there are three palaces:

The Upper Prime Palace rests upon the mountain’s flank, nearest to Heaven. The Celestial Bureau oversees it, charged with reviewing merits, recording good deeds, and promoting or demoting ranks.

The Middle Prime Palace lies to the mountain’s left, governed by the Terrestrial Bureau. Within it stands the Spirit Prison, where guilty souls are judged and summoned to account.

The Lower Prime Palace stands to the mountain’s right, close to the Wind Ramparts, under the jurisdiction of the Aquatic Bureau. Beneath it stretch the Nine Great Prisons of the Frigid Waters, the Courts of the Eight Tribulations, where the world’s most heinous and rebellious sinners are confined.

Each of these three palaces contains three bureaus, and each bureau comprises one hundred twenty nether-offices. All officials within the bounds of Mount Fengdu number ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand, all chosen from among the world’s most enlightened spirits.

The Nine Departments are the Nine Ramparts of the Earth Sovereigns and the Nine Command Offices. The Twelve River Sources—such as the guiding of Mount Qian and Mount Bo—serve as the places where guilty souls are divided and judged.

Now the Heavenly Venerable has commanded all heavens to strictly examine and promote the adepts. He has also issued the Nine Dragon Talismanic Decrees, universally proclaiming to the Three Primes, ordering that for the adepts, the sins of their ancestors and collateral kin from kalpas past be swiftly expunged from the registers, the roots of the Three Evil Realms eradicated, and no lingering obstructions allowed to bind them to the ranks of imprisoned ghosts. Thus, they shall be promoted at once.

A hymn says:
Who proclaims the talismanic decree?
It releases the dark prisons’ suffering bonds.
Returning to the root, restoring the origin, it revives destiny—
Each person, at every moment, ascends.

The Northern Capital’s Frigid Pool marshals and guards the forms and souls, restrains demons, ensures protection and promotion, and ranks them for the Southern Palace. The dead souls undergo refinement; through immortal transformation, they become human. Those who receive the living-body liberation endure kalpa after kalpa, everlasting. As kalpas turn, they share Heaven’s years.

Within the yin realm of Mount Fengdu lies the Capital of Solitary Darkness and Utter Desolation, governed by the Five Numinous Elders of the Five Qi Heavenly Lords. Amid the Nine Earths, the Northern Yin Heavenly Lord presides; amid the Nine Waters, the Great Abyssal Water Emperor rules. Together, they are called the Northern Capital. There dwell the Three Realms’ Great Demons, the Three-Five Generals, the Six Jia Officials, the Five Thearchs’ Examiners, as well as the Punitive Divine Soldiers and the Ten Thousand Mighty Heavenly Warriors—all deities who oversee the registers of guilty souls.

Those in the world who cultivate shallowly yet bear deep karmic burdens cannot avoid returning here. In life, they are yang souls; in death, they become yin spirits. If their deluded roots remain unsevered, their yin souls scatter and dissolve, impossible to grasp. Thus, their forms are marshaled and guarded to prevent dissolution, demons are restrained, and protection and promotion are ensured. They are ranked in the Southern Palace, where the dead souls undergo the Great Fire’s refinement. Their ghostly substance is consumed entirely, and then they are feather-transformed into immortals.

The “dead souls undergoing refinement” refers to the rebirth of flesh and blood—not merely the body born of parents, but the Dao-body. Thus, it is called the “living body.” Once this Dao-body receives immortal liberation, it turns with the kalpas and shares Heaven’s years.

A hymn says:
The form and soul need only my support;
Restrain the demons, and they will not deceive.
This living body must liberate itself—
To wait for their protection would be too late.

Eternally liberating from the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Tribulations, transcending the Three Realms, and roaming freely in the Highest Clarity.

The Heaven of Highest Clarity is the Jade Thearch’s realm, the colorless realm of Brahman conduct. The Three Paths refer to hell, the ghost realm, and the animal realm. The Five Sufferings include the knife mountains and sword trees, as well as the worldly sufferings of birth, aging, poverty, sickness, and death. The Eight Tribulations refer to falling into alien forms, being born lowly, having misshapen features, living in borderlands, possessing violent natures, not encountering a benevolent ruler, constantly facing war and fire, and all manner of karmic obstructions arising from good deeds.

Thus, the *Scripture of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings* states: “When the three karmas are pure, one does not fall into the Three Paths.” These are the body, mind, and speech. From these three karmas arise the ten evils’ roots, the source of all karma. When karma is pure, hell ceases to exist; when speech is pure, ghostly qi dissipates; when the body is pure, one is not reborn in alien realms. Abandoning the five poisons eliminates the Five Sufferings. The five poisons are the eye beholding the five colors, the nose smelling the five fragrances, the tongue savoring the five flavors, the ear hearing the five sounds, and the mind generating the five desires. If even one sense and one dust are purified, from where could the Five Sufferings and evil paths arise? They would naturally vanish.

Cultivating the Eight Practices dissolves the Eight Tribulations. These are benevolence, filial piety, loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, gentleness, forbearance, precept-keeping, and equanimity. From these Eight Practices arise the roots of all virtues and the foundation for transcending the world. Some interpret the Eight Tribulations as the affairs of imprisonment in hell, but this is a limited view, not encompassing the ultimate principle. The correct understanding lies here.

The Highest Clarity is the Jade Thearch’s capital, the colorless realm of the Great Dao. Brahman conduct refers to the Dharma—there are methods to cultivate and practices to advance, hence it is called Brahman conduct. When dead souls receive liberation, they pay homage to the Imperial Capital, then ascend to their respective heavens according to merit, progressing step by step in cultivation.

A hymn says:
All defilements arise from the mind’s dimness;
The Three Paths and Five Sufferings burden the form and soul.
When the Heavenly Light washes away the roots and dusts,
Immortal transformation faces the origin and pays homage to the Supreme.

This section describes the ranks of the four hundred thirteen heavens.

Previously, the decree was issued to the Three Realms to root out life and death and promote the adepts. Next, the ranks of ascent and descent among the various heavens shall be expounded, to demonstrate the stages of progress in cultivation.

A note on collation: This is the third of eight sections in the *Blue Prime’s Annotated Scripture*.

The Eastern Eight Heavens: The Primordial Beginning accumulated the nine yang Brahman qi to form them. Thus, they correspond to the Eastern Six Heavens, comprising the two heavens of the Desire Realm and the Yellow Top Heaven of the Form Realm, which stands at the head of the Void Brahman’s constellations, next to Kui and Bi. The remaining seven heavens’ constellations follow: Dipper, Ox, Girl, Void, Rooftop, House, and Wall.

A note on collation: Another edition annotates the imperial vestments, with the six heavens of the Desire Realm being the Azure Crown, Azure Robe, Azure Garment, and Azure Skirts. ○ The nine yang are divided into pure and turbid; the qi of singular lightness forms the heavens, which lie beneath the host of heavens, fifty-two billion myriad leagues from the mortal realm, at the boundary of the Wind Firmament. Those who practice the Threefold Purity and establish the merit of a hundred virtues are reborn in these heavens. The lifespans of the heavenly beings vary; newly ascended from the mortal realm, their defilements of desire are not yet extinguished, and thus the inhabitants of these heavens possess visible forms. Among them, some regard clasping hands as desire, others words or glances, still others bodily union—hence the name Desire Realm. The bliss of these heavens surpasses all others, and thus many cling to it greedily; signs of decline readily appear, and when their lifespans end, they sink once more into the various destinies. If they gradually cultivate and suddenly extinguish the defilements of desire, they ascend into the Form Realm. Practicing the Lesser Vehicle’s Way may realize this state, known as heavenly beings. As the sutras say: those who cultivate the Six Perfections and walk the path of initial progress. These heavens possess the Three Hundred Sixty Precepts of Grand Purity to restrain their inhabitants. When the great kalpa’s fire arises from the roots of Kunlun, the world is scorched by Brahman flames, and the conflagration ascends to the Harmony Yang Heaven; there, the primordial qi dissolves, and the heavens collapse.

A hymn says:
Jade towers and pearl pavilions are the roots of desire,
Fair maidens and radiant beauties play celestial melodies.

Should one but cease to indulge in attachments,
The halo behind the nape grows ever brighter.

The Eighteen Heavens constitute the Form Realm.
Here, the clear and turbid qi, refined into subtle clarity,
Form their hues, distinct from the formless below.

Those of the Light Dust Heavens who observe the Seven Hundred Precepts of the Upper Primordial,

Ascend to these heavens.
Though free from passionate desire,
They still possess visible forms and hues—
Hence, the Form Realm.
Should one gradually cultivate and suddenly extinguish the dust-like defilements,
So that form and hue no longer arise,
One enters the Formless Realm.
If attachment arises, one may yet fall back to the lower heavens.
Practicing the Middle Vehicle’s Way may realize this state,
Known as Heavenly Immortals.
The loftiest among them are called Perfected Immortals.
As the *Names of the Four Fruits* states:
The heavens possess the Two Hundred Forty Precepts of Upper Clarity
To restrain their inhabitants.
When the great kalpa’s flood arises from the Eastern Well,
Mighty springs churn the waves,
Inundating the world,
Rising to the Ultimate Wind Heaven,
Where the primordial qi dissolves,
And these heavens collapse.

A hymn says:

Collated note: Another edition annotates: "The Emperor wears a blue crown, white pendants, black robes, and vermilion skirts."

The Four Heavens constitute the Formless Realm. The pure, lofty qi, refined from the separation of clear and turbid, forms the color of these four heavens—pure azure—situated below the Seed-People, thirty-six myriad leagues from the Form Realm. It is the radiance of azure mist. When the celestial beings’ dust defilements are entirely purified, they penetrate into the natural state and ascend to this heaven. Their forms become subtle and wondrous, now large, now small, no longer bearing color or image, invisible to others, hence it is called the Formless Realm. Within this heaven, there are no sun, moon, or stars, and their lifespans are boundless. Only when both emptiness and existence are forgotten, and all habitual tendencies are extinguished, do they ascend to the Seed-People. Those who cultivate the Great Vehicle’s Dao may realize this, and are called Perfected Beings.
Annotation: In the Bodhisattva Heaven, there are one hundred and twenty precepts of Jade Clarity to restrain and regulate the celestial beings. As in the great kalpa of fire, it burns up to the Heaven of Harmonious Yang; in the kalpa of water, it floods up to the Heaven of Ultimate Wind.

Where water and fire wane and cease, unable to ascend further, they intermingle and combine, stirred by winds that scatter the primordial qi. From Xiaomang to Xiaodu, the six heavens are destroyed by wind; from Yuandong onward, the seven heavens merely see primordial qi disperse and recombine, unbound by the kalpas of the Three Realms.

*Verse:*
Gradually entering non-action, attaining the Dao’s essence,
Not a speck of dust clings—mind perfectly pervades.
Gazing back to survey the three thousand realms,
The myriad dharmas all return to a single emptiness.

**Haoting Xiaodu Heaven**—also called by different names—corresponds to the north, aligning with the stellar mansions *Shen* and *Jing*. Though celestial beings here have purified even subtle defilements, residual habitual tendencies remain, and thus they ascend to this heaven. **Emperor Hui Awakens Darkness**—these three characters are the inner name of the Heavenly Lord, inscribed in golden script and concealed within the Heaven’s *Qiongyao* Palace.
*Collation:* An alternate text annotates: "The Emperor delivers and elevates cultivators."

**Yuantong Yuandong Heaven**—also called *Great Non-Emptiness*—corresponds to the north, aligning with the stellar mansion *Shen*. Here, celestial beings have forgotten all sensory defilements, retaining only consciousness, gradually entering qi-contemplation, and thus ascend to this heaven. **Emperor Brahma Conducts Birth-Observation**—*Brahma Conduct* is the inner name of the Heavenly Lord; *Birth-Observation* is the Emperor’s hidden title. These four characters are inscribed in golden script and concealed within the Heaven’s *Zhenyuan* Palace.
*Collation:* An alternate text annotates: "The Emperor delivers those who cultivate immortality."

**Taiwen Hanrong Miaocheng Heaven**—also called *Non-Perception*—corresponds to the north, aligning with the stellar mansion *Zui*. Here, celestial beings have forgotten both consciousness and perception, their qi-contemplation growing ever more refined, and thus they ascend to this heaven. **Emperor Nayuchou Ying**—these four characters are the inner script of the Heavenly Emperor and Demon King, inscribed in golden script and concealed within the Heaven’s *Lingyou* Palace.
*Collation:* An alternate text annotates: "The Emperor governs and oversees demon kings."

These four characters are inscribed in golden script and concealed within the Heaven’s *Hualing* Palace.
*Collation:* An alternate text annotates: "The Emperor records and oversees demon kings."

These four heavens constitute the **Seed-People Heavens**. Pure and turbid qi divide to form the colors of these four heavens, distinct from those beneath the Great Luo. They lie one million three hundred fifty-eight thousand *li* beyond the Formless Realm, within the vista of the Great Void. Only those celestial beings who, having traversed all heavens and extinguished all sensory leaks, attain the formless and the formless itself—all utterly quiescent—suddenly forget all habitual tendencies and penetrate the true Dao, ascend to these heavens.
*Annotation:* Within the heavens of right cultivation and attainment of *samādhi*, they abide eternally unperishing. Mostly inhabited by sagely sovereigns and worthy ministers of past ages—such as Fuxi and the Zhou Confucius—there are no prohibitions here. They soar upon primordial qi, ascending to pay homage to the Nine Purities. If their accumulated merits attain true subtlety, they ascend into the Great Luo, cultivating the supreme vehicle’s Dao, and are called **Immortal Sages**. When the great kalpas converge and the three disasters arise, the Three Realms are utterly destroyed, yet the primordial qi of these heavens recombines as one. The sages descend into the mortal world to inaugurate teachings, establish laws, and create the myriad things to deliver the multitudes. Thus, the *Scripture of Spirit-Generation* states: "To replenish the seed-people." This is the meaning. As they are the seed of the people, they are called *Seed-People*.

*Verse:*
Formless and shapeless, the great Dharma-body,
Neither born nor extinguished, called *Perfected Truth*.
Though kalpas wear even stone to naught,
The numinous radiance remains, silent and bright.

**Taixu Wushang Changrong Heaven**—also called *Immovable*—its color is green, corresponding to the north, aligning with the stellar mansion *Mao*. Here, celestial beings, having just exited the Three Realms, suddenly forget all habitual tendencies, delighting in non-action and gradually entering spirit-contemplation, ascend to this heaven. **Emperor Overseer of Ghosts and Spirits**—these are the Heavenly Emperor Lord’s primary hidden name and the inner sound that subdues demons. These four characters are inscribed in golden script and concealed within the Heaven’s *Wanfu* Palace.
*Collation:* An alternate text annotates: "The Emperor examines the merits of cultivators."

**Tai Shi Yulong Tengsheng Heaven**—also called *Great Immovable Heaven*—its color is azure, corresponding to the north, aligning with the stellar mansion *Wei*. Here, celestial beings suddenly cast off all habitual tendencies, their spirit-contemplation growing ever more refined, and thus they ascend to this heaven. **Emperor Miaomiao Xingyuan**—these four characters are the Emperor Lord’s hidden title, inscribed in golden script and concealed within the Heaven’s *Baigai* Palace.
*Collation:* An alternate text annotates: "The Emperor summons and gathers immortals and sages."

**Longbian Fandu Heaven**—also called *Supreme Wondrous Heaven*—its color is crimson, corresponding to the north, aligning with the stellar mansion *Lou*. Here, celestial beings, utterly pure and undefiled, realize the fruit of non-emptiness, and thus ascend to this heaven. **Emperor Yun Shang Xuanyuan**—*Yun Shang* is the Heavenly King’s inner script; *Xuanyuan* is the Jade Perfected’s general sound. These four characters are inscribed in golden script and concealed within the Heaven’s *Lingbao* Palace. This heaven possesses separate palaces called *Yanzhen*. Those of the Buddhist tradition who see their nature and become Buddhas, suddenly awaken to the Great Vehicle, and penetrate the supreme vehicle, dwell therein. They travel through the Three Realms’ heavens, teaching celestial beings and bodhisattvas, cultivating all Brahma-conducts.
*Collation:* An alternate text annotates: "The Emperor advances immortals to sagehood."

**Taiji Pingyu Jia Yi Heaven**—also called *Supreme Wondrous*—its color is dark green, corresponding to the north, aligning with the stellar mansion *Kui*. Here, celestial beings penetrate the wondrous Dao and realize the supreme mysterious awakening, and thus ascend to this heaven. Those who cultivate and progress to this point are called *Ultimate Ascension to the Mysterious*, transitioning into the Three Realms. **Emperor Great Selector of Dharma-Gates**—these four characters are the Heavenly King’s general script, inscribed in golden script and concealed within the Heaven’s *Tianbao* Palace.
*Collation:* An alternate text annotates: "The Emperor universally delivers the bodies of cultivators."

The thirty-two heavens, thirty-two emperors, and the hidden names and titles of all heavens.

Within the heavens lies the Hollow Cavern, where the numinous scriptures arise naturally. The hidden melodies of all heavens, the sounds within the heavens, the revered within the heavens, the spirits within the heavens, the great demons within the heavens, the numina within the heavens—nine harmonies and ten unions transform into the Supreme Clarity, boundless in mystery and too profound to expound in full. They unfold and settle the divine perfected, universally delivering the celestial beings.

The Heavenly Worthy expounds that all heavens and emperors are formed from the qi of the Hollow Cavern, spontaneously coalescing. These concealed writings are the secrets of emperors, demons, spirits, and the revered; the spirits rely upon them to transform, soaring through the void and flying in the Supreme Clarity. They are the chants of nine harmonies and ten unions, beyond comparison to mere words and phrases.

*"Fu"* means to spread; *"luo"* means to place. All were opened and transformed by the Primordial Beginning, who set them forth and arranged them among the heavens, enabling the holding of celestial qi to deliver celestial beings.

**Eulogy:**
Each heaven bears a distinct name,
Yet only cultivation keeps one free from dust.
Ascend to the highest realm of all heavens,
And you shall know *Pingyu* as a true person.

*Collation:* The thirty-two heavens are divided into four: the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, the Formless Realm, and the Heaven of Seed-People. The *Qingyuan Sutra Commentary* details the sequence of inner cultivation and outer conduct for adepts in full.

I have studied and compared Daoist scriptures and Buddhist canons, compiling a chapter on cultivation and realization, appended to the end of this sutra.

**The Edict to Demons for Protecting the Dao (266 words):**
Having clarified the ranks and exhorted cultivation, we now inspect and command the spirits, sweeping away demonic trials to shield and support the adepts.

*Collation:* This is the fourth of eight sections in the *Qingyuan Sutra Commentary*.

Today, we joyfully receive deliverance, passing through the barriers of all heavens. We beseech the eradication of the Three Evils, the severance of earthly roots, the flight beyond the Five Gates, and the inscription of our names in the Great Mystery. Demon kings oversee and endorse, unhindered at the gates of heaven.

When one commits unwholesome deeds, the hun-soul grows wrathful, and the spirits depart the body, knowing it will descend into evil destinies. If one performs all wholesome acts, the hun-soul rejoices, and a hundred spirits gather, knowing it will attain the Dao. When an adept finally achieves perfection and receives deliverance, the hundred bones and myriad spirits exult together.

"Today" refers to the day of attaining the Dao. Those who seek immortality must sever their evil roots, dissolve their karmic stains, and purify their bodily vessel to attain transcendence. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy declares that on this day of joyful deliverance, one must pass through the barriers of all heavens, personally pay homage to the great emperors, beseech the eradication of the Three Wretched Paths, and cut off the karmic roots held by the Earth Bureau. One avoids the Five Sufferings, records one’s name in the register of the Great Mystery Capital, and is inscribed in the immortal roster. Thereupon, the demon kings of all heavens supervise and endorse the perfected, with no obstruction at the gates of heaven.

**Eulogy:**
Having traversed the arduous roads of all barriers,
This time, one’s name is joyfully inscribed on the golden tablet.
Who can restrain the aspirations of a true person?
Returning in glory, one moves freely with the four-horse chariot.

The Eastern Dipper governs fate-calculation; the Western Dipper records names; the Northern Dipper decrees death; the Southern Dipper bestows life; the Central Dipper, the Great Chief, oversees all spirits.

The Azure Emperor guards the hun-soul; the White Emperor attends the po-soul; the Vermilion Emperor nurtures qi; the Black Emperor circulates blood; the Yellow Emperor presides at the center, governing the myriad spirits without exception.

The Eastern Dipper’s nine stars generate qi, thus governing life-calculation. The Western Dipper’s five stars form shapes, thus recording names. The Northern Dipper’s seven stars hold the mandate of life, thus decreeing death. The Southern Dipper’s six stars enforce prohibitions, thus bestowing life. The Central Dipper’s five stars, the Great Chief, thus oversee the hundred bones and myriad spirits.

For one’s cultivation, names must be inscribed in the Five Dippers before descending spirits guard and protect, enabling the attainment of the Dao. This is the Heavenly Worthy’s salvific embrace to safeguard adepts.

Each Dipper’s apex has an emperor. When the Five Emperors reside in heaven, they govern the Three Realms, commanding all spirits without transgression. When their qi descends into the human body, it circulates through the Three Fields, regulating the Five Qi. Thus, the Azure Emperor governs the liver and guards the hun-soul; the White Emperor governs the lungs and attends the po-soul; the Vermilion Emperor governs the heart and nurtures qi; the Black Emperor governs the kidneys and circulates blood. The Yellow Emperor presides at the center in the Yellow Court, governing the hundred bones, ensuring the myriad spirits do not err.

Qi that is pure and ascends is called celestial yang; qi that is turbid and descends is called terrestrial yin; that in between is called numinous yin. The Dao of yang is divided into upper, middle, and lower, yet its function is one. The Five Directions and Five Viscera each transmit a qi, merging into one, congealing into the perfected—termed *Lingbao* (Numinous Treasure). Thus, when the five spirits are tranquil, the myriad qi flow unimpeded; when the Three Fields ascend and descend, the spirits become pure and unified. When spirits are pure and unified, they merge with the Dao and attain truth, achieving immortality. All these elucidate how *Lingbao* regulates spirits and protects the Dao for adepts.

The Azure Heaven Demon King, Bayuan Choubo; the Vermilion Heaven Demon King, Futian Danshi; the White Heaven Demon King, Fanshan Liumu; the Black Heaven Demon King, Jianchou Langfu; the Yellow Heaven Demon King, Hengtian Danli. The Five Great Demon Emperors are the ancestors of all spirits, flying and drumming in procession, commanding ghostly legions, wielding banners and drums, roaming the great void, self-proclaimed as resplendent, their merits equaling all heavens.

The Azure Heaven Demon King has a green face and crimson hair, commanding the Nine Uglies, soaring through the void—his hidden name is Bayuan Choubo. When his qi descends into the human body, it depletes liver qi, causing erratic joy and anger.

The Vermilion Heaven Demon King bears primordial qi, propping up heaven and earth, his strength capable of toppling mountains—his hidden name is Futian Danshi. He depletes heart qi, making one violent.

The White Heaven Demon King has one head and six eyes, his strength shattering mountains, roaming the Three Realms, obstructing good deeds—his hidden name is Fanshan Liumu. He depletes lung qi, making one gluttonous.

The Black Heaven Demon King has a fierce and malevolent form, overseeing lesser uglies, delighting in slaughter—his hidden name is Jianchou Langfu. He depletes kidney qi, making one fond of killing. The Yellow Heaven Demon King often rides a feathered chariot, soaring through the Three Realms, traversing heaven and earth, singing lewd songs to harass and confuse learners—his hidden name is Hengtian Danli. He depletes spleen qi, bringing misfortune and illness.

These Five Great Demon Emperors are the Heavenly Kings. When they manifest as demon kings, they test learners. If one recognizes them, they transform together, and the demons each reveal their imperial forms to ascend and deliver the learner. Now, by the grace of the Heavenly Worthy’s transformation and deliverance, they are gathered and subdued. Thus, the flying drums and banners lead their subordinate demon soldiers, roaming and inspecting the great void, issuing commands with resplendent might, equal to all heavens. On behalf of the Heavenly Worthy, they traverse the cosmos, sweeping away demons and delivering learners.

A hymn says:
Named Heavenly Kings yet called demons,
Traversing heaven and earth, shattering mountains and rivers.
Once I recognize their names,
Their banners and spears topple, jade ornaments hang still.

The heavens deliver humanity, strictly governing the Northern Feng;
Divine Lords receive the mandate, universally sweeping away misfortune.
The Eight Awes spew venom, fierce steeds spread in four directions,
Heavenly Soldiers lead the vanguard, Great Marshals wield banners,
Hurling fire for ten thousand miles, ringing bells in eight directions.
Should any dare to challenge or obstruct the Perfected of the Highest,
Golden axes strike first, the Great Heavenly Punishment follows,
Slaughtering ghostly spirits, wind and fire unceasing,
Thousands upon thousands beheaded, myriads upon myriads dismembered.
Demons dare not intrude, ghosts dare not bewitch,
The Three Offices and Northern Feng inspect ghostly camps,
No concealment allowed, reported by the Golden Horse Post.
Universally proclaimed without end, all spirits heed.

The Three Realms and Five Emperors report to the Highest Clarity,
For the sake of delivering humanity, strictly governing and subduing the demons of the Three Realms.

Moreover, in the Northern Capital of Fengdu, there are six celestial cavern palaces, each presided over by a great demon king, with countless subordinate minions. They deplete people and harass learners—all such afflictions stem from them. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy subdues them to protect learners.

The Divine Lords are the Chancellors of Jade Clarity, receiving the Heavenly Worthy’s decree to proclaim commands and dispel misfortune. The Eight Awes are the giant horned dragon, lion, poisonous dragon, fierce tiger, dark leopard, cinnabar serpent, qilin, and giant xiezhi, spewing venom to subdue evil. Heavenly steeds spread in four directions, Heavenly Soldiers lead the vanguard to receive orders, Great Marshals wield banners to command the march. A single cast of raging fire soars for ten thousand miles; a single shake of the ringing bells clashes in eight directions. Should any dare to challenge or obstruct the true mandate of the Supreme Emperor, Heavenly Soldiers wielding golden axes strike first, while Mighty Warriors brandish the Great Heavenly Axes to mete out punishment. Ghostly spirits are slaughtered without pause, swift as the wind. Thus, it is reiterated: thousands upon thousands beheaded, myriads upon myriads dismembered, demons dare not intrude or disturb. True ghosts, devoid of malevolence, are no longer spectral. The Three Offices and cavern palaces of the Northern Capital each inspect ghostly camps, allowing no concealment or delay. Reports are transmitted by the Golden Dragon Post, universally proclaimed throughout the boundless world, so that all spirits of the Three Realms may hear. Once the sweeping is complete, the myriad spirits of the Three Realms and the Five Emperors of the Five Directions report their merits to the Highest Clarity. All this is the Heavenly Worthy’s ordained teaching, to sweep away demons and protect the bodies of learners. If one’s inner realm is harmoniously tranquil, spirit and numen fully arrayed, entering the great samadhi, then no evil can intrude, and demonic tests vanish.

A hymn says:
To learn the Dao, rely much on wisdom’s power,
Like the clear river’s mother stirring wind and waves.
Melt the heart, enter beyond the cinnabar clouds,
What can a thousand spears and halberds do to me?

The *Highest Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Limitless Deliverance of Humanity*, Commentary, Volume Two, concludes.
The *Highest Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Limitless Deliverance of Humanity*, Commentary, Volume Three begins.
The *Primordial Exposition of the Dao for Refining the True and Preserving Deliverance* Chapter.

Sentient beings cling to forms, making it difficult to fathom the subtle and profound. Thus, the Primordial is re-explained in its undifferentiated state, clearly presenting the model.

Collated note: This is the second chapter of the *Qingyuan* Commentary on the Scripture.
The cyclical evolution of heaven and earth spans eighty-eight words. Previously, demons were subdued to protect the Dao; now, the generation and completion of life are re-initiated, distinctly manifesting the efficacy of the Numinous Treasure.

Collated note: This is the fifth of eight sections in the *Qingyuan* Commentary on the Scripture.
The Primordial Cavern’s Jade Chronicle spans from Dragon Han to Yan Kang, through countless eons, within the primordial chaos. Above, there was no longer any color; below, no longer any abyss.

The Primordial Cavern refers to the ancestral qi of the Primordial Great Cavern. The Jade Chronicle records the rise and fall of celestial perfected beings’ merits, as well as the cycles of kalpas and deliverance. Beginning in Dragon Han and ending in Yan Kang, heaven and earth are generated and completed. How many times have they formed and dissolved? No memory remains—thus, it is called "countless." With each kalpic dissolution, heaven and earth scatter, mountains and seas melt away, all phenomena vanish, leaving no forms. Only the qi of the Primordial Cavern remains undifferentiated, the primordial chaos beginning to take shape. Thus, it is called "primordial chaos." At this time, the true unity of water was obscurely contained, and the Five Phases had not yet taken form. Above, no visible colors; below, no fathomable abyss. Wind and marsh pervade the void, the adamantine qi rides the heavens. Between heaven above and heaven below, there is no darkness, no obscurity, no form, no shadow, no limit, no end—vast and boundless, the Great Brahma, empty and lightless.

Wind is wood; marsh is water. Above wind, below water, empty and void, the qi fans and moistens, and the adamantine qi bears the root of heaven. The forms of heaven and earth begin to appear here. Darkness and obscurity refer to concealment and revelation; form and shadow refer to phenomena.

The term "utmost extremity" refers to the boundaries of division. "Míng-xìng" denotes vast and boundless expanse. Within primordial chaos, above heaven and below heaven, all was formless and indistinct—how could there be distinction between concealment and revelation, or between phenomena and their boundaries? Only the qi of the Great Brahma, vast and boundless, accomplished its work of itself; desolate and expansive, it remained without light or shadow.

Later, when the qi of the adamantine wind intermingled, fire was generated. The Four Symbols transformed and combined, and earth naturally took form, broadly supporting heaven and earth and nurturing the myriad beings, becoming the master of creation. Once the Five Phases were distinguished, the Two Modes began to separate. Thus, yang qi ascended to form heaven, and yin qi descended to become earth—this is the Dao of heaven and earth through the mutual generation of the Five Phases.

Moreover, the Three Realms’ perfected immortals transcend calamitous kalpas as easily as turning one’s palm, like the passing of spring and autumn in the world. Yet sentient beings, sunk in the cycle of birth and death, revolve endlessly—just so.

When the Red Clarity unfolded its chart, the revolutions proceeded naturally. In the first year of the Red Clarity, the great revolution unveiled the chart, the jade calendar fixed the epochs, and heaven and earth opened anew. Thereupon, heaven and earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations, mountains and rivers, and all phenomena were at once distinguished. Day and night, cold and heat, the four seasons advanced in succession, each finding its proper place without error—hence it is said the revolutions proceed naturally.

In the world, one *jiazi* cycle marks a minor transformation; one hundred years, a mid-term; five hundred years, a great transformation. Ten great transformations make a minor kalpa; three minor kalpas make a great kalpa—this is the pattern of kalpas without end.

The qi of primordial chaos descends as an omen, giving rise to the Five Phases, and in its cyclical return becomes the beginning and end of heaven and earth. It is like a person in the womb, gradually taking shape and gaining consciousness, the five viscera unfolding and transforming, with the cinnabar field as their foundation, nurturing the millet pearl—this alone is wondrous.

If one refines and forges the treasure through the qi of the Red Clarity, the revolutions proceed without error, naturally harmonizing with the Dao, forever becoming a perfected person, unbound by this kalpic revolution.

**Eulogy:**
The kalpic revolutions of heaven and earth share the same pattern as humanity—
Transformation and destruction are impermanent, beginning and ending in cycles.
Only the single numinous treasure remains,
Radiant and resplendent, eternally enduring.

The Primordial Beginning settled and stabilized, unfolding the Five Chapters. The red-script jade characters, the eight mighty dragon scripts, govern and restrain the kalpic revolutions, ensuring the heavens endure forever.

Once heaven and earth were established, they remained subject to kalpic revolutions. The Primordial Beginning observed the shaping of Brahma’s qi and carved jade into cloud-seal script to stabilize the Brahma heavens. Having undergone refinement by fire, it is called the "Red Script." Inscribed as the numinous treasure texts, they fully contain the wondrous, primordial, divine, and true Dao—hence the Five Chapters.

One serves to restrain kalpic disasters; another to uplift those of lower attainment, enabling scholars to awaken to its wonders and enter its wonders, awaken to its primordiality and enter its primordiality, awaken to its divinity and enter its divinity, awaken to its truth and enter its truth, awaken to its Dao and enter its Dao. Only then, having fully merged wonder with primordiality, primordiality with divinity, divinity with truth, and truth with the Dao, do they naturally become indestructible and imperishable, transcending the revolutions, enduring with heaven forever.

**Eulogy:**
The Five Chapters’ texts conceal profound efficacy,
Governing and restraining calamities to stabilize the Brahma palaces.

This is the true and wondrous oral formula of the Red Writ, whose talismanic script serves as its outward form.

**Collation Note:** As stated in *The Scripture of the Nine Grades of Immortals*: In the primordial chaos before the separation of the myriad heavens, when the Primordial Beginning first took shape and the Five Kalpas began their transformation, the Celestial Venerable of the Dawn Dao of the Brahma-Origin Ancestor was commanded to inscribe the Heavenly Origin, thereby setting in motion the revolving Five Kalpas.

Thus, the *Primal Cavern* was established to perfect the ancestral qi, while the *Jade Chronicle* was instituted to record the Heavenly Origin. From the differentiation of the One Qi, the Three Causes coalesced into the Nine, resembling dragons coiling through nine pathways—boundless and infinite—all comprising the origin of the Nine Yang’s ancestral qi. The Most High harmonized and merged them with the Brahma-qi.

First, the ancestral qi of the Azure Heavenly Origin was activated, granting the Eastern Quarter nine qi to divide its celestial realm, its kalpa named *Dragon Han*. Next, the qi were merged to activate the ancestral qi of the Vermilion Heavenly Origin in the South, granting the Southern Quarter three qi to divide its celestial realm, its kalpa named *Red Brightness*. Then, the qi were merged to activate the ancestral qi of the Central Yellow Heavenly Origin, granting the Central Quarter twelve qi to divide its celestial realm, its kalpa named *Supreme August*. Again, the qi were merged to activate the ancestral qi of the Pale-Spirit Heavenly Origin in the West, granting the Western Quarter seven qi to divide its celestial realm, its kalpa named *Prolonged Prosperity*. Finally, the qi were merged to activate the ancestral qi of the Mysterious Black Heavenly Origin in the North, granting the Northern Quarter five qi to divide its celestial realm, its kalpa named *Inaugural August*.

Once the Five Kalpas had run their course, the Vast Heaven took form, the One Qi merged with the Dao, and the Eight Radiant Sceneries streamed forth their light. The Eight Emperors manifested their forms, and the Nine Empyreans branched into differentiation. Thus, the Celestial Venerable of the Primordial Beginning commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to inscribe the *Jade Chronicle* at the inception of the *Primal Cavern*, recording the fundamental revolutions of kalpic cycles. The myriad heavens divided their realms and conjoined the Five Yang qi of the *Primal Cavern* into the *Jade Chronicle*, which documented the Way of ascent and descent for Heavenly Perfected Ones and Heavenly People based on their kalpic merits, clarifying the nine grades of the Nine Sages. This is appended here for reference. As for the reckoning of kalpic years, their exactitude remains unverified. Since kalpas vary in magnitude—great, middling, and small—their years differ as well. The greatest is the kalpa of heaven-and-earth’s formation and dissolution, while others are divided into major, intermediate, and minor kalpas. Their precise durations are secrets of the heavens, unrecorded in scriptures, and thus beyond mortal comprehension.

These truths coalesce into the One Hundred and Sixty-Eight Words of the Perfect Real. The preceding elucidates the principles of generation and establishment, while the present text precisely indicates the wondrous workings of the true numen nurturing the precious transformation.

**Collation Note:** This is the sixth of eight divisions in the Azure Origin’s annotated scripture.

The Brahma-qi pervades the cosmos, unfolding the myriad patterns. The primordial net flows and evolves, spanning the Thirty-Two Heavens. Revolving without form, it circulates through the Ten Directions. It wheels through the Dipper and traverses the Winnowing Basket, cycling through the Five Constants. In thirty-five divisions, it gathers the qi of the Upper Origin. The Eight Sceneries merge in profound obscurity, where qi enters the Mystery of Mysteries.

The Brahma-qi is the transformation of the One Qi of the *Primal Cavern*, existing before heaven and earth as the root of the Great Dao. Swiftly ascending and soaring since the primordial kalpa, it blankets the Three Realms and enmeshes the myriad heavens. The Primordial Beginning relies upon it to govern the cosmos, while heaven and earth depend on it for generation and completion. Once the Two Modes separated, all phenomena were arrayed—hence the unfolding of the myriad patterns. The Brahma-qi serves as the net of primordial transformation, flowing through the Thirty-Two Heavens like a wheel in natural motion. The Formless Realm arises, circulating through the Ten Directions in an unbroken stream. From the Dipper to the Winnowing Basket, it traverses the Twenty-Eight Constellations in a leftward cycle, completing one celestial revolution corresponding to a human year. The Celestial Stem revolves leftward, while the Five Planets turn rightward, converging to fulfill their functions. The Twenty-Eight Constellations, combined with the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets, form thirty-five divisions. Collectively, they receive the qi of the Supreme Heavenly Origin, where the Eight Sceneries merge in profound obscurity—this is called the Mysterious Work. Mysterious yet again mysterious, hence the term *Mystery of Mysteries*. As the *Precious Chapters of Spirit Generation* states: "The chaotic transformation returns to the Mysterious One, exaltedly uniting with the Primordial Beginning Sovereign." Like the human body, where sinews and vessels intertwine and the hundred vessels flow unimpeded, the primordial qi circulates, nourishing the entire body. The Three Fields flourish in purity, the Five Viscera attain clarity and harmony, and only then is perfection achieved.

**Eulogy:**
The Brahma-qi revolves as taught, left and right,
Swiftly completing one celestial cycle.
How wondrous—without the slightest effort,
It ascends to Huaxu to meet the Supreme Immortals.

Within the Mystery dwells the Supreme August, the Highest Perfected of the Celestial Emperor. They drift upon the Great Radiance, chanting and intoning the *Cavernous Chapters*. Golden perfection gleams in luxuriance, its resonance streaming through the cloudy encampments. Jade tones gather qi, while numinous winds amass mist. The Purple Void flourishes in splendor, aiding and sheltering the myriad immortals. Through a thousand harmonies and ten thousand unions, perfection is naturally achieved.

The Mystery refers to the Purple Tenuity at the heart of the Heavenly Center, the Central Palace of the Mysterious Metropolis. The Supreme August is the Illustrious August Dao Sovereign; the Highest Perfected of the Celestial Emperor are the Perfect Ones of the Numinous Treasure. Within the Mysterious Metropolis dwell these Supreme Perfected Ones, who drift upon the Great Radiance and chant the *Cavernous Chapters* to initiate and deliver learners. Thus, golden perfection coalesces in brilliance, its voice resonating through the cloudy encampments. Jade tones gather the scattered qi, while numinous winds blend to generate mist. Pervading the Purple Void in flourishing splendor, they aid and shelter the myriad immortals. Through a thousand harmonies and ten thousand unions, the Numinous Treasure is perfected, and transcendence is attained. For those who cultivate perfection, when the Brahma-qi revolves and the Celestial Emperor’s Perfected Ones abide in stillness, golden light shines in clarity, drifting clouds linger—naturally, the tiger’s roar summons the wind, the dragon’s chant gathers qi, and the Great Treasure is consummated without fail.

**Eulogy:**
The ancestral qi faces the Origin, mysterious yet again,
The Supreme August’s visage wholly preserved.
Winds and mists gather and disperse, the spirit-light steadies,
Refined into form, harmonizing with the natural.

Within the true dwells the spirit—the Great Lord of Longevity, the Peerless Duke, the Venerable White Prime, the Celestial Thearch of Grand Unity, the Longevity Directors Peach and Plum, who grasp talismans and hold registers to safeguard life and root existence. They ascend to the Upper Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Chambers. Within the Eight Obscurities and the subtlest realms, they descend to guard the Mud-Pellet and Crimson Palaces of the human body, governing the Five Qi and harmonizing the hundred spirits.

The Great Lord of Longevity is the revered star within the Dipper. The Supreme One and Peach-Kang serve as his vanguard and guardians; the Peerless Duke and Venerable White Prime act as his ministers and attendants—all are perfected beings of the Dipper. They wield jade talismans, stabilize golden registers, safeguard the human form and destiny, and govern the root of generation and transformation. Above, they roam beyond the Upper Clarity’s lofty void, entering and exiting the Cinnabar-Flower Chambers, traversing the Eight Obscurities and the subtlest realms of creation. Below, they guard the human dwelling, residing either in the Mud-Pellet Palace or the Crimson Palace. At the center, they regulate the qi of the Five Movements and harmonize the hundred spirits.

When their qi descends into a person, it becomes the radiant essence of the inner landscape: the Great Lord of Longevity presides over the heart, the Venerable White Prime governs the lungs, the Peerless Duke resides in the liver, the Supreme One and the Longevity Directors dwell in the kidneys, while Peach-Kang and He-Yan oversee the spleen. The talismans and registers symbolize the circulation of qi and blood, preserving the root of life. One resides in the navel to regulate the Five Qi; the other ascends to the brain to harmonize the hundred spirits. Their union, timed with precision, is called "inversion and ascent-descent in proper order," or "reversion and recurrence."

Thus, when the Five Phases invert, the Great Treasure’s qi becomes full; when the Three Fields revert, the yang spirit ascends, and one forever becomes a perfected being. Through ten revolutions of circulation, the numinous light permeates the body, and the myriad qi are all attained—ascending as an immortal, transcending the leakless state. As the *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* states: "When the celestial qi returns to the one body, all become natural beings."

**Eulogy:**
Wondrous are the Seven Numinous Treasures,
Above they reach the Celestial Pass, below the finest dust.
Their use depends on but a single secret,
And one transcends the leakless to become a perfected being.

Ten revolutions of the numinous, the myriad qi ascend as immortals.
Ten is the complete number of yin and yang: Qian nine and Kan one make ten; Kun six and Li four, Xun two and Dui eight, Gen three and Zhen seven—all combine to form ten. This is the great number of heaven and earth, the root of transformation. Thus, ten revolutions of the numinous complete the supreme cycle of the celestial sphere, naturally filling the numinous light and returning the myriad qi to their origin, each attaining its true nature.

**Eulogy:**
Ten revolutions complete the three numinous,
The myriad qi return to their root, merging into the One True.
Whoever grasps this mechanism,
In an instant, heaven and earth turn to gold.

**Collation:**
The annotations of the scripture interweave and unify, forming the True One in one hundred sixty-eight words. These are the wondrous methods of the Numinous Treasure for refining form and completing destiny, further elucidated in the *Qingyuan* commentary.

The *Dao De Jing* states: "The valley spirit does not die; it is called the Mysterious Female." This is the root of inner alchemy’s return to the origin and revival of destiny. For one gathers the medicine and returns, enters the chamber to form the embryo, sloughs the husk and emerges from the womb; ascends to the crown to refine form and release knots, dissolves the fetal toxins through nurturing until qi is full, form is replete, and merit complete—then one regulates the spirit and exits the shell. The *Sacred Records of Lord Lao* instructs: "Let the feathered transformation of immortals never cease. When the elixir is complete, one sheds the husk, ascends the void, and rides the light—possessing a body beyond the body, this is called an immortal."

The lineage of the Purple Yang Perfected Zhang in recent times has produced alchemical scriptures and oral instructions such as the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*, the *Awakening to Reality*, the *Green Void Hymns*, and the *Purple Clarity Writings*, which also reveal much. For example:
*"At the pool’s bottom, the sun reddens and yin demons vanish;
At the mountain’s peak, the moon whitens and the medicinal sprouts renew.
Returning to the root has its returning aperture,
Reviving destiny seeks its reviving pass.
Mao and You, Jia and Geng demand bathing;
New moon, first quarter, full moon, and dark moon—each guard against peril.
A hundred moments of cold and warmth must be precisely managed,
The six lines of civil and martial observed in stillness."*

The true mechanism of gathering medicine, bathing, and fire-times with withdrawal and addition has never been concealed within the texts. Yet the prohibitions are most weighty, shared across ancient and modern times. Trials by demonic tests demand steadfast resolve. Thus, only through true practice, accumulated deeds, and layered merit can one encounter the conditions for accomplishment.

Similarly, the *Can Tong Qi* explains the matter of Bodhidharma’s wondrous union of form and spirit, returning west with a single sandal. The *Veritable Records* include a summary of the *Scripture on Embryonic Breathing*:
*"The gate of the Mysterious Female,
The portal where the radiance abides.
If one can practice both,
Naturally, the sweet dew descends."*
This is none other than the essence of the *Dao De Jing*.

There is also a *Song of Regulating the Spirit*, which aligns with the methods of regulating the spirit in the alchemical scriptures:
*"Regulate the spirit as an infant,
All dharmas are without emotion.
Serene, oh so serene—
The spirit, of itself, attains tranquility.

Regulate the spirit as an infant,
Through cold and heat, withering and flourishing.
Nurture it, shelter it—
Form and spirit, of themselves, become steadfast.

Regulate the spirit as an infant,
Uniting and parting form and spirit.
When form and spirit unite and part,
They are like a lapis lazuli bottle:
Within, a golden image,
Vacuity and fullness intermingling.

The image is the dharma-body’s metaphor,
The bottle, the physical form’s.
Externally, it cannot be stained;
Internally, it cannot gather dust.
Image and bottle,
Luminous and distinct.

Neither one nor two,
Like water, still and clear.
No turbidity, no clarity—
Water, too, has no form.
Exiting not through doors,
Neither by effort nor by method.

The mirror, if bright,
All images manifest of themselves.
The water, if clear,
The moon’s reflection appears of itself.

Not attained through study,
Not achieved by a teacher.
Like a worm eating wood,
By chance, it forms of itself.

The forms of the myriad images
Are like the moon’s brightness;
The names of the myriad dharmas
Are like the echo in a valley.

The dharma is originally without dharma,
The name originally without name.
Without name, without dharma—
Spirit and form do not arise.

When spirit and form do not arise,
Stimulated, they then arise.
If the wind of delusion does not stir,
How could the spirit not be tranquil?

Listen well yet seem deaf,
See well yet seem blind.
Wisdom is not as good as foolishness,
Age is not as good as infancy.

Regulate it for a thousand days,
And naturally, one awakens.
Awake within the dream,
Dreaming within the awake.

The enlightened do not speak,
Those who speak are not enlightened.
To speak is to leak;
With leakage, nothing is born.

The sun awaits its morning rise,
Yet my nature is ever bright.
The moon awaits its fullness,
Yet my body is eternally formed.

Heaven nourishes the form,
Embracing the numinous and holding the essence."*

The clarity of ghee, the fragrance of udumbara.
Practicing the flavor of emptiness,
The spirit rejoices, the body is purified.
Blood transforms into milk,
Bones into jade.
The lion’s roar is mastered,
The wild ox’s cry is altered.
A white hair appears upon the forehead,
The Golden Immortal’s Dao is accomplished.
The wondrousness of the Patriarchs
Lies in profound stillness and darkness.
The spirit does not see the form,
The form does not see the spirit.
When the heart is without heart,
When the form is without form—
Even the heart is not seen,
What name could there be beyond this?
Form and spirit without master,
All faculties are at peace.
Who is strong? Who is weak?
Who perishes? Who is born?
Who rejoices? Who rages?
Who fears? Who startles?
Who thinks? Who ponders?
Who is humbled? Who is honored?
Like the sun ascending the heavens,
It moves of itself, illuminates of itself.
Diligently practice this,
The path of the Patriarchs.
Here it is appended.
Four hundred thirteen words to exhort and encourage scholars.

Previously, the refining of true norms was expounded;
Now, diligence and indolence are revealed,
Promotion and demotion made clear,
The exhortation reiterated.

Collated note: This is the seventh of eight sections in the *Qingyuan Annotation of the Scripture*.

The Dao of immortals values life,
Delivering boundless beings.
Above, eight gates are opened,
The Dharma-wheel of flying immortals.
Karma and precepts, karmic causes and conditions—
Universally received and delivered,
The dead soul revives in the body.
The body attains rebirth,
Ascending to be heard by the heavens.
Above the heavens,
Each has its gate of life.
Within are the hymns of the Hollow Cavern,
The sacred chapters of demon-kings,
Whose words align with the lofty perfected.

The Dao of immortals cherishes life,
More earnestly than the pursuit of life itself.
The Dao of immortals delivers beings,
Ever desiring that all living things not die.
Yet the principle of death and extinction
Is self-delusion in the human world.
Thus, the Most High, in boundless compassion,
Opens the eight gates above,
Responding to the eight origins below.
From within the eight gates, all who cultivate
May ascend to perfection and enter the wondrous.

The Dharma-wheel is the realm of the supreme wondrous Dharma,
Revolving without cease.
It also reveals the path of samsara,
Establishing precepts of karma and retribution,
Karmic causes and conditions—
All to awaken ordinary beings,
Enabling them to transcend the wheel of suffering
And turn the inexhaustible treasury of Dharma.
Thus, the dead soul revives in the body,
All attain deliverance by rank,
Ascending to report to the heavens.
Following their thoughts, they ascend into the heavens,
Each with its gate of eternal life.
The standards of ascent and descent
Are concealed within the hymns of the Hollow Cavern’s true tones,
Composed by the demon-kings
To exhort practitioners,
Their words aligning with the lofty perfected.

Verse:
The Dao of immortals, earnestly delivering scholars,
Opens eight gates toward the ford of delusion.
I urge you: enter only through the gate of life,
Ascend into the heavens and turn the Dharma-wheel.

**First: The Flying Void’s Sound of the Desire Realm**
The heavenly beings of this realm fall through desire and pleasure,
Thus the demon-king expounds the path of flying through the void,
Enabling them to leave all desires and pleasures,
Entering lightness and purity—hence, "flying void."
The human path is faint,
The immortal path vast,
The ghost path joyous—
Yet the human gate of life is paramount.
The immortal Dao values life,
The ghost Dao values death.
The immortal Dao is ever auspicious,
The ghost Dao ever inauspicious.
The lofty, pure, and numinous,
Sing sorrowful hymns in the great void.
Only wishing the immortal Dao be accomplished,
Not desiring the human path to wither.
In the Northern Capital’s Spring Bend Prefecture,
A myriad ghosts gather.
They only seek to cut short human years,
Sever the human gate of life.
Ah! Sing the hymns of the Hollow Cavern,
To subdue the Northern Feng.
Bind and send forth demonic spirits,
Sever the blades of the six ghosts.
The heavens’ qi flows boundlessly,
My Dao naturally flourishes.
The human path is subtle,
Easily lost.
The immortal Dao is vast,
Easily realized.
The six desires stain and cling,
Easily causing delusion—hence, "joyous."
The harm of desire
Lies at the root of human life.
The immortal Dao delights in deliverance,
Enabling transcendence of desire and pleasure,
Entering the high void.
Yet the heavenly beings’ root of desire
Never momentarily departs from the paths of immortals and ghosts—
Like the noble and the base,
Each delights in their kind, rejoicing together.
Thus, the immortal Dao esteems ascent,
The ghost Dao esteems descent.
Like the good who do good,
Never finding the day sufficient;
The wicked who do evil,
Also never finding the day sufficient.
Those who follow the immortal Dao
Are ever auspicious,
Those who follow the ghost Dao
Are ever inauspicious.
"Auspicious" means forsaking desire,
"Inauspicious" means clinging to desire.
Only the lofty and sagely,
Their words pure and numinous,
Pity the heavenly beings,
Who easily enter the ghostly realm,
Thus composing void hymns.
Recounting the suffering of the six desires,
They do not wish them to fall.
The Northern Capital’s Spring Bend
Is a place of confinement.
When heavenly beings exhaust their retribution,
They enter its bounds.
Hence: a myriad ghosts gather within,
Only seeking to cut short human years,
Sever the human gate of life.
The joy of desire’s stain
Brings such retribution.
Heavenly beings who preserve the human path,
Deeply abhor the ghostly realm,
Thus: Ah! Constantly sing the hymns of the Hollow Cavern,
Subduing demonic kinds,
Severing the roots of the six desires—hence, "blades."

Verse:
The six desires originally arise from darkness,
Dragging one into the ghostly path—how lamentable!
If you comprehend the sorrowful hymn’s meaning,
Bind all demonic hordes, and the Dao’s eye opens.

**Second: The Demon-King’s Chapter of the Form Realm**
The beings of this heaven delight in form and dust,
Thus the path of Jade Purity is expounded,
To leave form and forget dust,
Ascend the mysterious and enter the wondrous.
Lofty and vast,
Luminous qi spreads in four directions.
The Brahma-conduct, the balanced scales of sound—
The heavens encircle the ten directions.
Boundless great spirits
All arise from my body.
I possess the hymns of the Hollow Cavern,
Myriad transformations perfect immortals.
The immortal Dao values deliverance,
The ghost Dao clings to connection.
Heaven and earth are faint and vast,
Impure qi swirls thickly.
The joys of the three realms
Pass by, yet endure.
Deliver your body through my realm,
Your form enters spontaneity.
This joy
Is but slight grace from me.
The Dragon Han era flows boundlessly—
How can one distinguish the true?
My realm is difficult to deliver,
Thus I compose the hymns of the Hollow Cavern.
Transforming and flying through the void,
To test your body.
Success or failure, laxity or retreat—
How many are delivered?
Laughing at your failure to be delivered,
Thus I sing these hymns.

This celestial realm stretches vast and lofty, its luminous qi radiant in the four directions—transformed from the pure qi of Brahma, it pervades the ten directions. The boundless great spirits are but the illusory forms of heavenly demonic trials, hence it is said they all arise from my body. The Dao of immortals favors deliverance; through these Hollow Cavern hymns, one may forget the dust of form, transcend both emptiness and existence, and ascend into the Three Clarities. Yet heavenly beings mistake their joy for true bliss, unaware of their direction—thus it is said the immortal Dao values deliverance. The ghostly Dao ever clings to them, for advancement leads to immortality, while retreat leads to ghosthood; between progress and withdrawal, one must choose for oneself.

Between heaven and earth, the vastness is profound, impure qi thickly accumulates, and though the realm of form brings joy, it still harbors the suffering of kalpic disasters and falls—loss comes all too easily. One must forget the defilements of the dust, ascend into the Three Realms, and only then may one endure. To be delivered through this realm is to enter the true form of spontaneity; in that moment, neither birth nor extinction arises, and all becomes joy. My grace refers to the dust of form; it is precisely by transcending this dust that one attains it.

The Dragon Han is the Dao of the Jade Clarity’s supreme sages. Boundless and without limit, all may realize it, yet now you take joy only in the realm of form—thus truth and falsehood blur, and I compose these Hollow Cavern hymns to exhort you. Through myriad transformations, demons test heavenly beings; among them, the lax are many, the ascendant few. Laughing at your failure to seek self-deliverance, I speak these words.

**Hymn:**
Men say this realm is most difficult to cross,
I say the dust of form is easily dissolved.
If but your heart were iron,
Let the furnace’s fire forge and burn.

**The Third Formless Realm’s Demon King’s Song:**
The beings of this realm, through clinging to the mind, are instead ensnared by it—thus the Demon King expounds the way of correction, teaching them to recognize deception and decisively realize immortality.

Above the Three Realms, the vast Celestial Net stretches;
Above, no root of form, only cloud-layers towering.
Only the Primordial Beginning dwells
In the home of endless kalpas.
My realm is governed,
Inheriting the Mysterious Capital.
Those who transgress my realm
Enter the Jade Void.
I, the supreme king,
Correct and govern all demons.
In the void’s myriad transformations,
Impure qi blooms in profusion.
Those who preserve truth are few,
Those who stray and delude are many.
The immortal Dao is hard to stabilize,
The ghostly Dao easily turns to evil.
The human Dao lies in the heart—
Truly, it does not depend on others.
The immortal Dao values substance,
The human Dao values splendor.
If you do not delight in the immortal Dao,
How can you transcend the Three Realms?
Should you wish to cycle through the Five Paths,
What then can I do for you?

The beings of this realm, though they leave form and forget the dust, have not yet attained the ultimate Dao. Through clinging to demons, they are instead burdened by them—thus the Heavenly King sets forth the way of correction, seeking to awaken them. Above the Three Realms, only the vast Celestial Net of the formless origin remains, its cloud-layers towering, beyond the gaze of lesser immortals. Those who attain the Dao of the Primordial Beginning dwell within it, without beginning or end—hence it is called the home of endless kalpas. It is governed by the Jade Capital; beyond this boundary lies the realm of the Jade Void. The Demon King declares: I occupy the highest throne of this heaven, ever correcting and governing all demons to preserve enduring existence. In the flying void, with myriad transformations, I deliver those who cultivate, yet the impure qi of the dust ever blooms in profusion.

Though heavenly beings have left defilement and forgotten form, they have not yet relinquished their attachments, for the mind’s perceptions remain a hindrance. To contemplate emptiness and enter subtlety is yet more difficult. Thus the ghostly Dao is easily embraced, evil enters through desire, while true beings forget the mind through self-abandonment—truly, it does not depend on external matters. The immortal Dao values substance, the human Dao values splendor. If you, heavenly beings, do not advance toward the true immortal Dao, how then can you transcend the Three Realms?

**Hymn:**
Again and again I urge you to govern the demon hordes,
Yet still the demon hordes are so very many.
To become an immortal lies within yourself—
To dwell in the ghostly Dao does not depend on others.

**Record of Meritorious Fruits: One Hundred Seventeen Words**
The preceding has set forth admonitions; now the determined fruits of attainment are made clear to strengthen the resolve of cultivators.

**Collation:**
This concludes the eighth section of the *Qingyuan* commentary on the scripture.

Above the Three Realms, within the flying void, the Demon King’s songs interweave with the Hollow Cavern hymns. To recite them a hundred times is to be delivered through the Southern Palace. To recite them a thousand times is to have the Demon King safeguard and welcome you. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is complete, and you ascend into the great void. Having transcended the Three Realms, you attain the rank of Immortal Duke. Those who hear these numinous sounds receive the following merits: the Demon King respects their form, commands earth spirits, and provides escort and welcome. They are extricated from the earthly prisons, the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties; even their seven generations of ancestors ascend, forever freed from the ghostly bureaus. Their souls cross the Vermilion Mound, undergo refinement, and are reborn—this is called boundless deliverance, universal salvation without end.

The above songs are composed by the Demon King above the Three Realms, within the flying void. Their verses interweave with the Great Hollow’s hymns. If one recites them a hundred times, like heavenly beings, one leaves the dust and severs desire—thus one is said to be delivered through the Southern Palace. To recite them a thousand times is to contemplate emptiness and enter subtlety like heavenly beings, the Dao thereby complete, ascending into the great void. The Immortal Duke is the first rank of immortals in the Supreme Ultimate. Such are the merits attained through the recitation of this scripture. Those who hear or witness it gain the following merits: the Demon King respects their form, commands earth spirits, provides escort and welcome, extricates them from the earthly prisons of the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, and even their seven generations of ancestors are reborn. Thus both the living and the dead are saved—hence it is called boundless and infinite.

There are secret celestial texts,
Revered by all heavens.
To leak or slight them is to fall into hell,
Bringing calamity upon seven generations of ancestors.
This scripture encompasses all existence between heaven and earth, the sustenance of sages and worthies—thus, across forty thousand kalpas, its transmission is permitted only to the distant. Fearing that lesser beings might treat it lightly, strict prohibitions are set forth in verse.

The Hymn states:
The Three Qi mingle and coil to form the Great Net,
Their recitation shapes tones into celestial song.
The Heavenly Worthy expounds the Dao—yet the Dao is no-thing,
How could mere mortal brush or tongue suffice?

The Dao declares: These two stanzas are the hidden sounds of the Celestial Emperors and even the Numinous Demon Kings, all utterances of the Great Brahma, not the common speech of the world. Their words bear no ornate meter, their melodies no florid grace—thus are they called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail. Treasured by the heavens, they are sealed within the Mystic Capital’s Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, transmitted but once in forty thousand kalpas according to the Mystic Code. Should a perfected one offer gold and treasures with sincere heart, and swear oaths before the Ten Heavens in accordance with the ancient statutes, only then may they be entrusted. The arcana of sages and worthies lie concealed; lesser immortals cannot glimpse the true Dao, barely grasping its outlines. Only those of resolve, who pledge gold and treasures with sincere heart, are permitted transmission. The statutes of secrecy must not be lightly transgressed. Let later generations of shallow understanding take heed: those who recklessly alter or transmit to the unworthy should reflect upon these words.

The Hymn states:
The Jade Terrace is sealed deep with golden clay,
Cloud-brocade and dragon-script hidden in Purple Tenuity.
Once in forty thousand kalpas may it be encountered—
Dare any seeker grow lax in cultivation?

The Dao declares: The revolutions of heaven and earth, too, know decline and end; the sun, moon, and five planets, too, wax and wane; even the most sagely and divine, too, know rest and cessation; and the lesser learners, too, know sickness and harm.

Whenever such calamities arise, all of like qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites, offer incense in the six periods, and recite the scriptures ten times over—whereupon virtue and power descend at once, dispelling all inauspiciousness. The boundless scriptures universally deliver the limitless. For those who have not attained the true Dao, the alternation of fortune and misfortune is but the constant principle. Later learners, their hearts not yet steadfast, are thus given this chapter: even heaven and earth, the sages and the worthies, cannot escape the great reckoning—how much less the later learners! Those of broad understanding should thrice reflect upon these words, and they shall know no demonic trials.

Those of like qi are distinguished from the outset by purity and turbidity. From the One comes the Two, from the Two comes the Three, and from the Three come the ten thousand things; all forms and beings receive life from the primordial qi of the Origin. Every person shares this same qi.

The Hymn states:
Though divine beings of heaven and earth may differ in station,
How can the lesser escape disaster and woe?
With one heart, vow to deliver others—
Ten recitations of this text serve as exorcism and deliverance.

The Dao declares: When lesser learners of the Dao are shallow in cultivation, or their immortal rank not yet fulfilled, their allotted span comes to an end, and their bodies pass through the Great Yin. At the hour of their passing, fellow students and perfected beings offer incense and recite the scriptures ten times to deliver their corporeal form. If the rites are performed correctly, the hun-soul ascends directly to the Southern Palace, where, according to the merit of their cultivation, they are reborn after a set number of days. Escaping the wheel of rebirth, they attain immortality.

For lesser learners who have not yet fulfilled the Dao, their names are not yet recorded in the registers of the immortals. When their allotted span ends, form and consciousness dissolve, and they cannot avoid entering the Great Yin. Looking back upon the immortals of the yang realm, they are truly as distant as heaven and earth. Only if their fellow students extend deliverance may they return to yang as embodied beings.

The Hymn states:
Learners of the Dao aspire to ascend to truth,
Yet chasing delusion, they fall into the causes of suffering.
If their peers extend deliverance,
That very day, their hun-souls are refined in the Southern Elixir.

The Dao declares: When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, purification rites must be performed, incense offered, and scriptures recited. When the constellations fall out of alignment and the sun and moon lose their proper times, purification rites must be performed, incense offered, and scriptures recited. When the four seasons lose their order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, purification rites must be performed, incense offered, and scriptures recited. When the sovereign faces calamity and warfare erupts on all sides, purification rites must be performed, incense offered, and scriptures recited. When pestilence spreads and the people suffer death and injury, purification rites must be performed, incense offered, and scriptures recited. When teachers and companions pass away, purification rites must be performed, incense offered, and scriptures recited.

The merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is most weighty: above, it dispels heavenly calamities and safeguards the emperor; below, it averts poison and harm, delivering the people. In life and death, all rely upon it—its blessings are beyond measure. Thus it is called boundless, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

To benefit oneself and others is the foremost practice. The Most High established this chapter to clarify that this scripture not only delivers oneself but may also universally aid heaven and earth, sovereign and subjects, the people—only then is the Dao complete, and the universality of deliverance made manifest.

The Hymn states:
Learners who cultivate the Mysterious Chapters
Must not forget the heart of compassion and love.
For nation and family, extend deliverance—
Only then does the merit of delivering others become boundless.

The Dao declares: Whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for heaven and earth, the sovereign, and the people—when calamity arises, if they resolve in their hearts to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times—all the heavens record their names, the ten thousand spirits attend and protect them, and those of superior attainment are destined to become ministers of the Golden Portals of the Sage Sovereign. The heavens record the merits and faults of people without the slightest error. Even the demon kings of heaven will advocate for those who attain the Dao, for they have thoroughly mastered these profound words.

Those who revere and honor this teaching, yet lightly transgress or profane it, even once—such persons are not tolerated by spirits and gods, much less the heavens! The Most High, seeing that the resolve of worldly people wavers and falters, thus declares that the heavens record the merits and faults of people without the slightest error.

The preceding chapter already established the solemnity of scripture recitation; now, the four kinds of noble deeds are reiterated to further encourage and exhort. "All the heavens record their names" means their merits are inscribed in the celestial registers. "The ten thousand spirits attend and protect them" refers to the divine hosts of the Numinous Treasure. "Those of superior attainment" are distinguished by the Five Emperors as "Perfected Beings." "Destined to become ministers of the Golden Portals of the Sage Sovereign" means they shall serve as attendants to the Sage Sovereign of the Golden Portals.

The Hymn states:
If the learner’s resolve is as fleeting as foam,
Diligence and indolence make steadfastness hard to attain.
But if one thoroughly masters the words of the Numinous Treasure,
That very day, they may roam the Upper Clarity.

The boundless sounds of the Great Brahma’s hidden language in the heavens,
The first chapter of the Numinous Writ of the Origin.

The Eight Heavens of the East:
Vast and life-generating, they illumine the heights,
Awakening the primordial through the cavernous void.
Responding to the Mysterious Nine Perfected,
Their transformative intermingling initiates the cosmic pattern.
The literary numina weave their structures,
While the ancestral model resides in the Mysterious Capital.
All responsive changes are encompassed,
Their majestic radiance self-manifesting.
Verdant peaks shift their vistas,
The imperial Dao embraces luminosity.
Celestial jade shines with authority,
Qi-essence nurtures the hun-souls.
Fused in a net of radiance, they stand firm,
The circular brilliance concealed in hidden splendor.
Their appointed vast spirits envelop all,
The grand net proclaims tranquility.

The Eight Heavens of the South:
Vermilion flames diffuse and pervade,
Firmly unfolding to clarify the ancestral lineage.
The empty image of the Mysterious Flower,
The Dragon-Yang dances in the vault of heaven.
Subtle rectitude gleams in the clouds,
The profound and grand congeal in stillness.
The primordial pass has three junctures,
The Great Brahma soars through the void.
Hidden awakening brings abundant benefit,
The celestial order presents its felicity.
Divine portals entwine in networks,
True primordiality scatters its essence.
Pure grasp of the obscure and luminous,
Revolving and uniting, they ascend and transmigrate.
Guiding the soaring, they feast upon clouds,
Spiritual responses ascend to heaven.

The Eight Heavens of the West:
Firm and lustrous, they subtly govern,
Yin’s austere solitary majesty.
Piercing qi clarifies the plain,
The imperial cavern opens the subtle.
Encompassing transformations respond in obscurity,
The clarified void is the Emperor’s terrace.
Pacifying the distant, they bow to the void,
Expanding the lushness of the Youthful Pool.
Binding whirlwinds descend to nurture,
Their beauty unscattered and unfurled.
Yang penetrates the hundred and six,
Submerged radiance conceals the steps.
The obscure expanse is profoundly silent,
True peaks convene the numinous.
Firm and grand, they follow the Dao,
Proclaiming their mandate to the soaring groves.

The Eight Heavens of the North:
Dragon-Peace transforms through the cavernous,
Pure Yang concealed in the Mysterious.
The square root returns to qi,
The image lies hidden in the lofty round.
Spiritual transformations and wise transformations,
Unbinding and refining the numinous root.
Crimson essence, pure Dao,
Their established title is Majestic and Honored.
Beneficial clouds are ever constant,
Through kalpas, they abide in the central mounds.
Lush cities of jade ramparts,
Their odes and melodies flow with felicity.
Receiving positions in the Jade Chamber,
The great statutes penetrate the obscure.
Mysterious chapters blaze and scatter,
The net’s wheel thus completes its cycle.

The Dragon Script and Phoenix Seal of the Upper Chapter,
Also named the Jade Chapters for Dispelling Calamities of Water and Fire.
Collated and noted: The *Qingyuan Jing Zhu* cites the *Heavenly Duke Scripture*,
Stating: "The Upper Chapter of the Great Luo Palace."
The "Observing Awareness, Luxuriant and Rich" refers to the Dragon Seal’s orthodox text.
The Shu edition places it after the Lower Chapter,
But since it is called the Upper Chapter, its seal script should be placed in the Upper Chapter’s sequence.
Other editions have already placed this after the Upper Chapter; we follow this arrangement.

Observing Awareness, Luxuriant and Rich,
The Great Luminance and Purple Numinosity.
The Nine Spirits deliver souls,
Opening the passes to the Jade Perfected.
Ah-Yi, resplendent and dazzling,
Flying heavens stream with sound.
The Wheel of Light, the Emperor’s constancy,
The Capital of Numinosity attains fulfillment.
Vast and open, the Great Possession,
Felicitous clouds initiate the numinous.
The Seven Luminaries radiate demons,
Serene and harmonious, they unfold glory.
The Void’s supreme origin,
Heaven’s revelation extends to the imperial abode.
The Four Exhalations nurture images,
Washing and shining, they soar with essence.
Brilliant and resplendent, penetrating Yang,
Floating vistas of jade light.
The Seven Numinous sing their odes,
The Purple Hall of the World’s Origin.
Net heroes scatter their vistas,
Illuminating the Jade Chambers.
The Eight Vistas gather their beasts,
The Shao King captures essence.
The Nine Capitals soar in luxuriance,
Flying life ascends to the Upper Numinous.
The Secret Net’s pure realm,
Fragrant and lush, the empty wheel.
Irrigating and nourishing the Yellow Flower,
The vast movement of the Mysterious Luminance.
Divine officials open and brighten,
Extending and winding through the cinnabar courts.
The great plan floats in light,
True constancy transforms the origin.
Graceful and subtle, white and distant,
The jade beams clarify the mist.
Pines stand in towering seclusion,
Vistas entwine in sevenfold coils.
Elegance coils through the Three Palaces,
Flowing radiance through the Nine Mysteries.
Silent and distant, the void remote,
Flying blossoms brush the imperial carriage.
Morning overflows the registers,
The Great Desert extends its course.
Ah-Qiu’s nine crossings,
Six dragons dance their traces.
Lush and misty, floating nets,
Purple essence, fragrant and profound.
The primordial vastness nurtures greatly,
The nine mechanisms transform Qian.
Covering forms with profound virtue,
The primordial river bathes essence.
Nurturing heroes, illuminating the distant,
Vistas of dawn, distant clouds.
The great array oversees all,
Elegant music restrains heaven.
The Purple Void’s distant mounds,
Kalpas’ measures intersect before them.
Azure clouds resonate with Brahma,
Distant and distant, roaming the origin.
Six transformations revolve their measures,
Severing and absolving evil transgressions.
Expansive stillness, the Mysterious Desert,
Ten thousand crossings achieve immortality.

The Middle Chapter of the *Numinous Writ of the Origin*,
Composed by the Dao Lord.

The *Heavenly Duke Scripture* states: Though there are many heavens, they are still bound by kalpic revolutions. Thereupon, the Jade Imperial Dao Lord composed the four chapters of the *Numinous Writ of the Origin*, congealing clouds into seal script. Each character was a square zhang in breadth, with eight corners trailing radiance, to pacify the thirty-two heavens. The Great Luo Palace holds the Upper Chapter—"Observing Awareness, Luxuriant and Rich"—the Dragon Seal’s orthodox text. The Middle Chapter is this text. The Lower Chapter, composed by the Dao Lord, is the "Forest of Horns Storing Clouds," wherein the August Person praises this hidden sound and expounds it anew.

The Eight Heavens of the East:
Knock the teeth nine times, visualize the nine-colored Mysterious Dragon leading the way ahead, with nine layers of blue clouds behind, enveloping the body’s form.

The secret incantation states:
Vermilion clarity opens the pattern,
Nine qi return to the true.
Governing the primordial pass,
The Great Spirit of the Blue Emperor.
Flowing transformations beyond the nine,
Entwining around my body.
Numinous sounds of eight writings,
Sixty-four chapters.
Penetrating heaven and earth,
Uniting with me as immortal.
Driving the dragon carriage,
Ascending to the imperial chariot.

After reciting, guide the qi and swallow nine times, then cease.

Danlou Acang,
The Contemplation of No-Thought Avalokiteśvara.
Danlou is the long tower atop Jade Capital Mountain.
Ah is the name of the celestial inspector of this heaven.
Anacang is the name of the roaming terrace in heaven.
Wu means emptiness; he means the gate of sun and moon.
Guan means observing, the taboo name of the Heavenly Emperor.
Yin means song, referring to the Jade Capital Danlou.
Its form is vast and great, reaching upward to the Alaya of the Mysterious Capital.
At each court assembly, Anacang ascends this tower to strike the great drum, whereupon all the celestial perfected and sages gather to sing the cavernous chapters. From between the gates of sun and moon, they pay homage to the Originator in the void. Then the Heavenly Emperor Guan Jue, leading the perfected, ascends the roaming terrace, thrice singing the cavernous chapters to open the deliverance of humans and heavens. This is the cloud script by which the Originator pacifies the Yellow Layered Heaven.

Xu Yan, Ming Shou,
Fa Lan, Pu Tan.
Xu Yan are the taboo names of the celestial perfected.
Ming Shou is the name of a former sage.
Fa, Lan, Pu, and Tan are the four perfected of the Jade Clarity’s four palaces.
When the great kalpa turns, the Originator commands Xu Yan to open the Jade Perfected’s palace to receive the many immortals.

Ming Shou presides over the upright qi, guiding and illuminating all heavens with Brahma’s radiance. Thereupon the Originator roams through the heavens, where the Dharma Wheel draws the ledgers, Lan Jue delivers souls, the Bodhi Wheel turns, and Tan Yi raises the banners. Thus the Nine Lands unfold their light, and disciples receive deliverance—this is the cloud script by which the Originator pacifies the Jade Perfected Heaven.

Jia Na A Yi, Hu He Liu Yin.
Jia Na is the celestial perfected who keeps the ledgers in this heaven.
A Yi is the name invoked for the jade groves and treasure trees in this heaven’s gardens.
Hu is the name of a flying heavenly divine king;
He is the title of the Originator’s breath-messages.
Liu means “to disseminate”;
Yin means “to chant.”
At the kalpa’s beginning, the Originator beneath A Yi exhaled the primordial Brahma qi, spontaneously forming numinous sounds that disseminated through the ten thousand heavens, all chanting in harmony. Then Jia Na raised the ledgers, determining life and death and right and wrong, and reported to the Jade Capital, whereupon the flying heavenly divine king descended to deliver the people of the world—this is the cloud script by which the Originator pacifies the He Tong Heaven.

Hua Du Qu Li, Xian Pu Yu Zhen.
Hua is the Eastern Marchmount’s Azure Flower Capital.
Qu means “melodies.”
Li is the name of a jade maiden.
Xian is the image of auspicious clouds.
Pu is the name of a treasure tower in this heaven.
Yu is the name of an emperor.
Zhen means “to arrive.”
When the Originator was in the Hua Capital, he commanded the immortals and sages to lead the jade consorts up the Pu Tower to sing the cavernous chapters, whereupon auspicious clouds gathered above. Thus the Jade Emperor arrived to open the deliverance of the Nine Nights—this is the cloud script by which the Originator pacifies the Yu Yu Heaven.

Da Luo Da Fan, San Yan Qing Yun.
Da Luo refers to the towering palaces of this heaven, whose uppermost courts are called the Da Luo Halls.
Da Fan is the title of the Originator’s great amnesty.
San Yan Qing Yun are the remnants of the Brahma qi from the Northern Heaven.
When the Originator proclaimed a great amnesty in the Da Luo Halls, gathering and refining the primordial qi, releasing imprisoned souls, all received the remnant qi to restore their origin, coalescing into clouds and mist—this is the cloud script by which the Originator pacifies the Yuan Ming Wen Ju Heaven.

The ode says:
A Na ascends the tower to sound the Dharma drum,
The cavernous chapters thrice resound at the gates of sun and moon.
The Originator roams, turning the Dharma Wheel,
Commanding Xu Yan to open the Jade Perfected’s palace.
The sighing breath becomes jade tones,
Disseminating through the ten thousand heavens to song and dance.
Heavenly lords and jade consorts ascend the Pu Tower,
Mists and clouds sway, unfolding the mysterious and pure.
The Da Luo Halls proclaim the great amnesty,
Countless beings all receive deliverance.

Fei Sa Yu Du, Ming Mo Shang Men.
Fei are the flying heavenly divine kings.
Sa describes swiftness.
Yu refers to the Jade Perfected.
Du is Feng Du.
Ming means “to understand clearly.”
Mo are the demon kings.
Shang means “the Supreme Emperor.”
Men refers to the gate’s attendants.
When the Originator expounded the upright Dao to the flying heavenly divine kings, from the Long Han kalpa to the Yan Kang kalpa, all swiftly responded. Disciples who clearly understood the sounds opened the Jade Perfected’s palace of eternal night, delivered the souls of the Eight Difficulties from Feng Du, where demon kings safeguarded their passage, the Supreme Emperor nurtured their spirits, and the gate’s celestial perfected joyfully ensured their deliverance—this is the cloud script by which the Originator pacifies the Mo Yi Heaven.

Wu Xing Shang Shou, Hui Zhi Liu Xuan.

Zhi means “to tread.”

The Originator, upholding the supreme Dao of emptiness, governs the eight directions, causing the Brahma qi to circulate and encircle the Northern Emperor’s palace, pervading all heavens. When the kalpa’s reckoning reaches its end, the Originator once more treads the void with flowing morning light to spread transformation. Xuan refers to the Void Peak Mountain, the destination of life and death. Disciples whose Dao is incomplete and whose bodies face dissolution ascend this mountain in spirit. Once their merit is complete and their virtue fulfilled, they proceed to the Southern Cinnabar for refinement and deliverance—this is the cloud script by which the Originator pacifies the Yue Heng Heaven.

The qi of A Mountain and Tuo Tower connects with the Jade Clarity. The lord of this heaven often roams there to observe the sins and blessings of people. The light of the sun and moon shines upon it. When disciples’ Dao is complete, the perfected of the Four Poles descend in elephant chariots to deliver their bodies, leading them to pay homage to the Xu Emperor of the Southern Cinnabar for refinement. The sun’s immortal youths then bathe their forms with the blossoms of ninefold yang golden essence—this is the cloud script by which the Originator pacifies the Meng Yi Heaven.

The Eight Southern Heavens:
Knock the teeth thrice, visualize the Vermilion Bird, phoenixes soaring straight ahead, followed by three layers of crimson clouds enveloping the body. The secret incantation says:
Three qi meander, the numinous phoenix comes flying.
Eight jade tones, resplendent in the Purple Tenuity.
Auspicious day, great celebration, my Dao unfolds.
Vermilion cinnabar nourishes, I gaze upward to absorb the numinous radiance.
Body born of water and fire, clad in crimson feathered robes.
Ascend the void, tread the flying steps, feet upon the cinnabar ladder.

This is the cloud-script by which the Primordial Beginning stabilizes the Harmonious Yang Heaven.

The *Fan xing* descends from the void—*Fan xing* refers to the Primordial Beginning. From kalpa to kalpa, through successive transformations, it coalesces into form from the great Brahma-qi, manifesting as a single spirit without undergoing womb-birth, emerging from the void, hence "descends from the void." The *Nine Spirits* are the Nine Radiant Perfected of the Jade Capital. *Tui qian* means that in this heaven, the name of the Central Terrace is the Perfected, who constantly attend the Heavenly Thearch, scattering flowers above, chanting cavernous hymns, and delivering celestial and human beings. This is the cloud-script by which the Primordial Beginning stabilizes the Reverent Radiance Heaven.

It is said that Mount Duo is where the myriad dragons submit. Within it lies the Yellow Chamber Palace, where Lord Luo resides, enduring from kalpa to kalpa without destruction or birth. At times, he leads the various *Pu* to ascend the Jade Terrace, singing cavernous hymns to deliver beings. Green Gauze—her name is Luo Ying—her form is like jade, beautiful and lustrous without ostentation. Riding the great Brahma-qi, she governs the Great Yin, her calculations aligning with the celestial origins without error. When the great kalpa turns, the sun and moon both converge at the Jade Terrace, awaiting the reopening of the kalpic destiny to resume their transformations. This is the cloud-script by which the Primordial Beginning stabilizes the Ancestral Drifting Heaven.

Hymn states:
From the vast kalpas comes the Primordial King,
In Dragon Han he preached the Dharma until Yan Kang.
Revealing the peerless true Dao-qi,
Its linked cycles govern the Eight Wastes.

When disciples perfect the Way and fulfill their virtue,
They petition the August Emperor to ascend Nanchang.
Jade pupils and yellow blossoms radiate light in four directions,
Fire-refined souls and spirits respond to the Nine Suns.

At first the Primordial descended to the mortal realm,
Brahma-qi congealed his form, soaring through the void.
The Perfected of Mount Duo attained the supreme Way,
Abiding in the Yellow Chamber, neither born nor destroyed.

When the numbers reached their limit, the kalpa turned.
These demons are called the Nine Capital Envoys.
The Primordial commanded the Three Officials to assist,
Jointly examining life and death.

Sháo is the demon king of the Divine Empyrean Palace,
Whose yáo songs disturb and test disciples.
If the heart remains steadfast,
The Bureau of Recommendations records them in the immortal registers of the Southern and Northern Offices,
Erasing their names from death.

Next, they enter the Golden Flower Mountain of this heaven,
To pay homage to the Supreme Unity Emperor,
Seeking the matching talismanic contract,
Thereby gaining admittance to roam and feast among the heavens.
This is the cloud-script by which the Primordial stabilizes the Imperial Reed Heaven.

It is said that above the clouds, a hundred harmonious incenses scatter,
Flowing with the blossoms of the five clouds.
Holding the Jade Seal of the Supreme Perfected and the Ten Absolute Spirit Banners,
Thrice daily they circumambulate.
With each circuit of the banners,
All the Heavenly Emperors of the various heavens gather beneath the altar,
Encircling it thrice,
Chanting the cavernous hymns,
Then initiating the deliverance.

If one recognizes this song,
The Great God of Rebirth opens the path of deathlessness,
Flowing the qi of eternal life.
Refining the five souls,
Once the five souls are refined,
The Eight Sceneries abide within.
Thereafter, they are recommended to enter the Mystic Terrace
And wander the Qian Forest.
After thirty-four years are complete,
The Primordial issues his command,
And they proceed to the Southern Cinnabar for refinement and deliverance.

To deliver those who are to be delivered.
When the celestial wheel completes ten revolutions,

Together passing through the Three Realms’ celestial gate.
Then the Yùnróng Jade Maiden,
With the qi of the Vermilion Mound,
Guides their souls,
While the dew of Mystic Harmony irrigates their bodies.

Hymn states:
Disciples wishing to pay homage to the Golden Flower Perfected,
How can they succeed without enduring the yáo songs’ trials?
Moreover, the flying life flows the Dao-qi,
Refining and bathing the five souls, clarifying the hundred spirits.
Nà turns the wheel—how dare the demons offend?
At Fùlǎng’s single intonation, the myriad forms are restrained.

This is the cloud-script by which the Primordial Origin stabilizes the Heaven of Jiangyou.

The Ode states:

This is the cloud-script by which the Primordial Origin stabilizes the Heaven of Joyous Harmony.

Jade Birth, Ever-Mulberry, Cypress Void, Delivering Immortals.
Jade Birth is another name for the Jade Capital of Heaven. Ever-Mulberry refers to the grove of Fusang.

Cypress Void is the sound of the Cavernous Chapters. Delivering Immortals means delivering people to achieve immortality. It is said that Jade Birth contains the soaring Fusang grove, which shades and covers all heavens, its leaves inscribed above with purple-script jade texts—the writings of the Great Cavern. Whenever the divine wind stirs the soul-returning grasses, the Fusang grove resounds with the music of a hundred pipes, naturally forming the melody of the Void Song—hence called Cypress Void. The numinous rooster perches upon it; when it crows, all roosters under heaven respond in unison. Then azure mist swirls upward, and the sun ascends. Thus, at the first cock’s crow, the flying heavenly perfected ones ascend the Jade Terrace, gather the five-directional cloud-teeth, and inhale the light of the Three Mornings, together delivering those who study immortality. This is the cloud-script by which the Primordial Origin stabilizes the Heaven of Vow and Oath.

At the limit of degrees, heaven and earth’s qi intermingle, the nine seas merge into one, and myriad waters fill the sky. The Covering Spirit governs the summit of Kunlun, filling the vast seas and damming the source of the Eastern Well, preventing the earth’s mechanism from sinking. When the kalpa’s end arrives, the Earth Mother emerges from the Eastern Well, summons the Bird Mother at Dragon Gate, convenes the river’s source, and ascends to the Emperor’s presence to report the kalpa’s reckoning. Then, with a great phoenix chariot, she bears the students upward to Kunlun to pay homage at the Mystery Capital. This is the cloud-script by which the Primordial Origin stabilizes the Heaven of Primordial Cavern.

The Feathered Forest lies north, merging its radiance with all heavens, subtly traversing the cloud palaces, weaving cloud qi into garments. This is the cloud-script by which the Primordial Origin stabilizes the Heaven of Wondrous Completion.

Eulogy says:

The Venerable Lord Ruanle of Infinite Honor opens the path to deliver the long-night’s souls from dark obscurity. Divine winds, drifting and light, blow to restore the wandering hunts; the empty songs of cypress trees all resound with cavernous speech. At the first crow of the numinous cock upon Fusang’s tip, perfected ones gather and consume cloud-sprouts. The macaque, not riding the course of fate, responds to Qian’s origin, revolving through the nine cycles to guard the root of heaven. When the kalpa ends, the Bird Mother meets at Dragon Gate; disciples ride the phoenix to ascend Kunlun. Receiving talismans in the Feathered Forest, they bow to new grace, their cloud-garments misty and distant as they attend the imperial chariot.

Those who comprehend this sound will be delivered by Radiance Lord, guided by the Shalan solar youth to refine their forms.

Thereupon, the celestial attendant at the imperial throne emits a single whistle, and a numinous breeze fans forth, forming the grand cavernous hymn. This hymn safeguards the heaven’s people from the constraints of kalpic destiny, and thus is especially cherished by them—hence, it is called *preserving the precious*. This is the cloud-script by which the Primordial Origin stabilizes the Heaven of Soaring Victory.

*Evil play* is the inner sound of the Heavenly Emperor. *None* is the Supreme Noneness Perfected. *Rank* means to assess. *Cavernous* means to illumine thoroughly. *Wondrous* refers to the Heaven’s blessed hall, called Wondrous Transformation. *Self* means *with*. *True* means to unite with the True. It speaks of how the Heavenly Emperor of Evil Play, through cultivation since the Primordial Origin’s kalpa, transcended the Three Realms and entered the Jade Void, thereby attaining the position of Great Sage. By the time of the Crimson Clarity’s unfolding chart, the Primordial Origin bestowed upon him the title of Brahmā-Deliverance Heavenly King. At that time, he commanded the Supreme Noneness Perfected to open the Long Night’s repository, assessing and delivering sinful souls, enabling them to thoroughly comprehend their past lives, purify all evil roots, ascend into the hall of Wondrous Transformation, and unite with the Dao in truth. This is the cloud-script by which the Primordial Origin stabilizes the Brahmā-Deliverance Heaven.

*Primordial Brahmā* is the great Brahmā of the Primordial Origin, the qi of wind and marsh. *Vast and boundless* is an expression of vastness. *Profound* means secluded and desolate. *Still* means empty and silent. *Delivering people* means delivering boundless beings. It speaks of how the qi of the Primordial Origin’s great Brahmā is vast and boundless, lofty and pervading the void, suspended yet never falling, ineffably subtle, profound and still, beyond sight and sound. Within it lies the True; within the True lies the essence, silently delivering the heaven’s people. This is the cloud-script by which the Primordial Origin stabilizes the Heaven of Wondrous Play.

The ode states:
When learners recognize the grand cavernous verses,
The demon kings of the Three Realms record their names.
Newly delivered ones ascend Mount Tuo,
At kalpa’s end, their merit assessed, they soar through the Three Luminaries.
Flying celestials advance to feast, ascending azure radiance,
Guiding the sages of the celestial realm.
Thrice daily they audience in the Seven Treasures Palace,
Before the Jade Ascension Emperor, offering their felicitations.
The Supreme Noneness Perfected delivers sinful souls,
Universally delivering them to thorough knowledge of past lives.
Majestic is the achievement, beyond reckoning—
The Primordial Brahmā, vast and boundless, is but the cosmic abyss.
Profound, still, beyond perception,
Within it lies the True Essence, most faithful and true.
Delivering people, aiding beings, ineffably wondrous,
Thus it is called the hidden language of boundless sound.

The Dao states: These are the great Brahmā’s hidden languages of boundless sound within the heavens, their ancient script spanning a full *zhang* in length. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Old inscribed their text to establish the correct intonation. Those who know these sounds and can fast and recite them will have the Flying Celestial Divine Kings descend to observe their forms, record their meritorious diligence, and report it to the heavens. Myriad spirits will pay homage, earth deities will attend at the gates, great merit demon kings will safeguard and recommend them as perfected immortals. Once their Dao is complete, they may traverse the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gate. This refers to the hidden script formed by Brahmā qi, which above can safeguard and stabilize the heavenly deliverance, summoning celestial immortals, and below can benefit the living, delivering suffering souls—hence, it is called *boundless deliverance of people*. The ancient script was formed by the Primordial Origin observing the traces of Brahmā qi’s flow, coalescing into characters, each a full *zhang* in circumference, thinner than the great void. Every eight characters serve as the root of a heaven’s qi. The formation and dissolution of all heavenly kalpas are also governed by the scattering and coalescing of these characters. Though even the loftiest sages cannot comprehend these characters, they commanded the Sovereign to transcribe them into the correct intonation. Only celestial immortals can recognize them.

The Great Merit Demon King who safeguards and recommends ascended immortals serves as the supreme deity governing the Three Realms, recommending disciples to ascend into the ranks of upper immortals. When their Dao is complete, they may roam the Three Realms and pay homage at the Golden Gate.

A hymn says:
*The sacred script of the Great Brahmā, hidden and secret,
Transcribed by the Sovereign, now spreads in its true form.
With a purified heart, recite it—all heavens rejoice,
And you shall ascend to become an upper immortal.*

This sound repels all, dispels all, delivers all, and accomplishes all—it is the natural sound of celestial perfected beings. Thus, reciting it causes flying immortals to descend, the Supreme Emperor to gaze from afar, the ten thousand spirits to pay homage, the Three Realms to attend in reverence, and all demons to bow in submission. Ghostly essences vanish at its resonant tones. The ten directions grow solemn and clear, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists, the myriad spirits tremble and submit, and immortals gather in assembly. The heavens are free of defilement, the earth free of demonic dust. Profound wisdom illumines the void, and the vastness of the mysterious deepens infinitely.

The preceding and following passages may be said to encompass all. Here, once more, we conclude by extolling fourteen merits of the *Lingbao* scriptures, inscribed at the end of this scroll to perfect the workings of the Great Cavern. *Profound wisdom illumining the void* constitutes the four sacred powers of the *Lingbao*:

*Profound* (冥) signifies profound resonance with all things.
*Wisdom* (慧) signifies boundless illumination.
*Cavern* (洞) signifies penetrating vision across the ten directions.
*Pure* (清) signifies utmost purity.

These are the complete virtues attained when the Dao of the *Lingbao* is fulfilled. *The vastness of the mysterious deepens infinitely* (大量玄玄): The Lord of the Dao, moved by this scripture’s boundless beneficence and ineffable wonder, cannot name its merit. To craft the myriad things without claiming credit—this is the virtue of the mysterious. Mysterious beyond mystery, the gate of all wonders—hence, it is called *the vastness of the mysterious deepens infinitely*.

A hymn says:
*The Three Caverns’ scriptures treasure the jade-like sound,
Their words resplendent, gleaming like pearls and gold.
They safeguard heaven, stabilize earth, dispel calamities,
Delivering all beings, endless as grains of dust.*

A collation states: The middle section of the *Lingbao* scriptures contains the Brahmā sounds of the thirty-two heavens, which safeguard and deliver. To recite and proclaim them is of immeasurable merit. The thirty-two heavens also serve as the ranks for heavenly beings and disciples in their cultivation and ascent. The Three Realms are divided into three vehicles, and the seed people enter the highest vehicle, where nature and life merge, uniting with the Dao in truth. Thus, the Dao’s completion is summarized in full. *Profound wisdom illumining the void* expresses this, and *the vastness of the mysterious deepens infinitely* further elucidates the wondrous awakening of the Great Vehicle and the supreme mystery.

A eulogy says:
*The great image is profoundly obscure, the name of the utmost mystery.
Obscurely uniting with the mysterious, seen yet formless.
In the depths of the void, Brahmā qi congeals.
Silent and vast, it merges with the Dao in perfection.*

What is *wisdom*? It is the meaning of the utmost spirit.
True wisdom arises naturally, adorned by the radiance of the spirit.
It illuminates all hidden realms, accomplishing all without exception.
Spontaneous and thus, such is its nature.

What is *cavern*? It is the designation of true emptiness.
The emptiness within heaven is expounded in the scriptures’ essence.
Not a single fine detail is obstructed, penetrating both inner and outer.
Emptiness is no-emptiness—only the state of being cavernous.

What is *pure*? It is the title of the True One.
The *Daode Jing* says: *Attain the One to achieve purity.*
At the origin of the One’s arising lies the Great Luo and Jade Purity.
Utterly pure, without blemish, returning to formlessness.

*Profound wisdom illumining the void*—these four are complete.
Emptiness and mystery merge in wondrous unity, mysterious beyond mystery.
Both being and non-being are forgotten, even nothingness is transcended.
Such is the ultimate merit of the *Taishang Dongxuan Lingbao Wuliang Duren*.

Those who recite them dispel inauspicious omens, purify the Dao’s qi, and bring about tranquility without exception. The Earthly Officials uphold the scripture, the hundred spirits revere and respect it. Divine cinnabar transcribes the text, wearing it brings evident verification. It is bestowed upon the most advanced disciples and not disclosed to the vulgar below.

**Eulogy by the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate:**
Divine clouds gleam in layered emptiness, Brahmā nets gather in the azure sky.
The Primordial Origin’s nine dragons draw the chariot, the Sovereign guides the blue carriage.
Spiritual light gathers the myriad perfected, pearl-like radiance opens the vast void.
Revealing the *Lingbao* scriptures, blessings and virtues are thereby summoned.

The Mystic Cavern’s lofty solemnity,
Jade tones ripple like cloud-borne zithers.
Boundless, beyond thought’s reach,
The Dao’s ocean surges with waves.
Dharma’s meaning flows as a gentle stream,
Nurturing fine sprouts to flourish.
Applied to relieve the destitute and hungry,
Its teachings flourish to guard the central court.
The August Emperor’s life spans a hundred million years,
Great Peace extinguishes blades and swords.
Bowing in reverence toward the Jade Celestial Court,
Divine blossoms scatter from golden brushstrokes.

**Comprehensive Eulogy:**
The Most High’s true scripture,
Boundlessly delivers humankind.
The body with which one is born of father and mother,
The root of one’s beginning,
Stands equal with Heaven and Earth,
Alike endowed with Brahmā’s qi,
Essence gathered to generate spirit.
Yet the mortal frame is burdened
By the six roots and six dusts;
The three karmas are poisoned,
First by gluttony, then by wrath.
Following the current, one forgets to return,
Gradually losing the good cause.
The Heavenly Worthy, in compassion,
Vastly saves the people of Heaven.
The wondrous merging of nature and life,
The scriptures lay open.
Returning to one’s root,
One does not fall into the turning wheel.

When the wondrous scripture was first proclaimed,
The nature of the Dao took precedence.
Silent and luminous, pure and clear,
The true and pristine source.
High and low, all equal,
Unobstructed by mountains and rivers.
The Jade Form’s pure hue
Manifests the nature of Heaven.
Within the emptiness of the Mystic,
A treasure pearl hangs suspended.
Once the true source is realized,
True emptiness is also complete.
Silent, without lingering resonance,
All returns to wordless forgetting.

How to comprehend life?
Refine qi to become immortal.
Align the five qi at the center,
Attain the Mysterious Female’s gate.
The hundred spirits merge as one,
The ten transformations of the embryo perfected.
Shedding the mortal to become true,
The body enters spontaneity.

To achieve this,
Meritorious deeds and practices must combine.
With eight hundred deeds fulfilled,
Three thousand merits accomplished,
The heavens record the deeds,
Not a hair’s breadth amiss.
Within the demon kings’ realm,
Luminous qi soars in four directions.
Sloth and retreat are warned against,
Gold and stone are not enduring.
Preserving and recommending one’s person,
One soars in flight, light and graceful.
Emptiness and existence both quiescent,
The source of defilements cut off.
Transcending the Three Realms,
Ascending to the Jade Void’s heights.

Following the scripture in practice,
One grasps the fish through the trap.
Disciples compose eulogies,
Yet the Mysterious cannot be exhausted.
Heaven’s grace overshadows all,
Universally delivering without limit.

**End of the Lower Scroll of the *Highest Prime’s Boundless Deliverance of Humankind, Supreme and Wondrous Scripture with Commentary***

**Verified Efficacy of Reciting the *Scripture of Deliverance***
**Master Du’s Experience in Recitation and Cultivation**

Du Yanzhen, a Daoist of Tianqing Abbey in Langzhou, devoted himself to cultivation and constantly recited the *Scripture of Deliverance*. Using his robe and alms bowl, he built a stone shrine to the Elder Lord, installing a tortoise-borne statue within. The entire hall was adorned with scenes depicted from the scripture, kept solemn and immaculate without negligence. At the age of seventy-eight, one day he suddenly addressed the assembly: “If you do not delight in the immortal Dao, how can you pass through the Three Realms? For now, I bid farewell to all. Preserve your resolve through the cold of years.” Having spoken, he knelt and transformed.

After the burial, a constant white light shone above the tomb, astonishing the local residents. When his disciples examined it together, they found a cavity in the mound and no trace of the body—only a pair of shoes remained. Yet none understood its meaning. Suddenly, a man arrived from Chengdu, saying, “Master Du has sent a letter.” Upon opening it, they read: *“Convey to the Stone Most High: tend diligently to the village tortoise.”* This referred to the stone statue of the Elder Lord. Only then did they realize their revered master had attained liberation through the dissolution of the corpse.

**Verified Efficacy of the Liu Family Daughter’s Recitation**
During the Shaoxi era, in Guozhou, a resident named Liu had a seven-year-old daughter. One day, a Daoist monk came to recite scriptures for alms, prompting the girl to ask her parents, *“What scripture is this?”* They replied, *“The* Scripture of Deliverance.*”* The girl expressed reverence and begged to receive it; her parents consented. Within less than a month, she had memorized it entirely and recited it day and night without cease. One day, a great fire broke out in the western neighbor’s home, engulfing her family in flames. Yet only the sound of her uninterrupted recitation could be heard. As the fire was about to reduce everything to ashes, a sudden whirlwind reversed its course, sparing the Liu household entirely. Was this not proof of the scripture’s divine protection over the faithful? Thereafter, she had printing blocks carved to disseminate the text.

**Verified Efficacy of Wang Ming’s Listening to the Scripture**
During the Qingyuan era, at the Baozhu Assembly in Zifu, a lame man named Wang Ming, who always leaned on a staff, regularly attended scripture recitations. One day, as the recitation reached the passage *“Deliverance of the Boundless Multitudes in the Ten Directions,”* he felt a surge of strength pulling at his feet. Though he saw nothing, he abandoned his staff and returned home. When asked the reason, Wang said, *“After twenty years of listening to the scripture, I have only now realized the efficacy of reciting it four times—even long-standing lameness can be cured.”*

**Verified Efficacy of Attendant Zhang’s Recitation**
During the Chunxi era, Zhang Jiangshi of the eastern street in Langzhou, in his later years, received the *Scripture of Deliverance* from a Daoist master. Each dawn and night, he purified himself, lit incense at the stove, regulated his voice and qi, and recited the scripture several times over—continuing thus for thirty years. One day, he suddenly told his family, *“Do you know I have studied the Way of corpse liberation?”* Soon after, he indeed departed this world in a separate chamber at the age of seventy-seven. Born in a *dinghai* year, after his burial, a month later—on another *dinghai* day—nine lotus stems emerged from the ashes of his funeral pyre, their color pure white and their slender stalks over a foot long. He summoned his relatives to witness this marvel, and all marveled in admiration. Three days later, the flowers withered, though their roots remained intact. Upon consulting the scripture’s hidden meanings, they found the line *“Those who seek rebirth arise from the lotus,”* and only then did they comprehend the event. Later, his son Xin passed the provincial examination in the *jiazi* year of Jiatai and became a prominent family.

**Verified Efficacy of Ren Zhao’s Recitation**
During the Jiatai era, Ren Zhao, a clerk in Shizhao County of Hezhou, lost his sight due to an eye ailment and resigned his post. He recited the *Scripture of Deliverance* in hopes of a cure. One day, his eyesight suddenly returned. Thereafter, he redoubled his devotion, vowing solemnly to transcribe the *Scripture of Deliverance* and commission an image of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy to be printed at its beginning. He used this to propagate the teachings at Tianqing Abbey in his prefecture, dedicating the merit to the reproduction of the *Daoist Canon* and its scriptures. The project was completed in no time. Was this not the fulfillment of the scripture’s promise that *“reciting it twice restores sight to the blind”*?
