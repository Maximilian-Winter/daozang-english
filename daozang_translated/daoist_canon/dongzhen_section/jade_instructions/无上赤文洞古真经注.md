**Commentary on the Supreme Vermilion Script of the Ancient Cavern Perfection Sutra**
*Annotated by Li Daochun, the Firefly-toad Scholar of Pure Hermitage in Duliang*

**Supreme (无上):** These two characters alone encompass the entire meaning of the sutra. The first chapter speaks of "non-movement and non-action," the next of "dimmed eyes and forgotten ears," and the following of "formlessness and bodilessness"—all expounding this very theme. Yet one must not construe it as either "being or non-being," nor as "non-being within non-being." Only when non-being does not negate being does it become true non-being. The scholar must grasp this true non-being.

One should know that bodily forms are illusory defilements, while colors and sounds are the roots of sensory dust. Externally, empty the colors and sounds; internally, empty the body and form. When both inner and outer are emptied, the True One abides eternally. Is this not "non-being within non-being"?

The Most High said: *"Emptiness empties nothing."* Since what is emptied does not exist, even "non-being within non-being" ceases to be. When "non-being within non-being" is no more, serenity endures in stillness.

The *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* states: *"The Changes are without thought, without action, still and unmoving, yet responsive and thus penetrating."* Master Chuan said:
*"Forms and desires are all delusion;*
*Formlessness and imagelessness fall into barrenness.*
*What need has the vast True Body to inquire?*
*A single beam of cold light illumines the Great Void."*

From this, we see that the founding masters of the Three Teachings all used true non-being to enlighten later scholars, guiding them to act within non-action and move within stillness. Internally, forget the body; externally, forget sounds and colors. Nurture the formless, guard the bodiless, preserve one’s original truth, and transcend beyond the void—this is the supreme vehicle, the unsurpassable. Hence, it is called *Supreme*.

**Vermilion Script (赤文):** "Vermilion" signifies the void, emptiness, and primordial *qi*. "Script" denotes radiant and universal illumination. The Buddhists speak of the "vermilion body" as the empty body, the "vermilion hand" as the empty hand, the "vermilion earth" as the empty earth, and "vermilion purity" as the empty image. Thus, vermilion is a metaphor for emptiness.

The *Explanation of the Trigrams* states: *"Qian corresponds to vermilion."* Qian is Heaven, which also signifies emptiness. Therefore, vermilion script is the script of empty *qi*.

The *Scripture of Salvation* says: *"The Five Scripts open the expanse,"* and *"Without script, nothing is saved."* These all refer to radiant clarity. If the scholar can embrace the root and return to the origin, entering the gapless, then empty *qi* shines brilliantly, filling Heaven and Earth, its luminosity universally illuminating. Hence, it is called *Vermilion Script*.

**Ancient Cavern (洞古):** "Cavern" means to observe; "ancient" means the beginning. By observing the ancient beginning, one knows the end. This is the doctrine of returning to the origin from the end.

The Most High said: *"Hold to the ancient Dao to govern present being."* The *Scripture of the Hidden Correspondence* states: *"Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp the workings of Heaven—this is perfection."* If the scholar can forget the eyes and silence the ears, withdrawing vision and reversing hearing, then naturally, light overflows boundlessly, and the mind’s awareness remains profound, fathomless.

One who cultivates this observation is called "illuminated and enlightened," first attaining the wondrous sound, penetratingly observing without obstruction, and thus knowing the ancient beginning. Hence, it is called *Ancient Cavern*.

**Perfection Sutra (真经):** "Sutra" means path—the great road traversed by all. It refers to the wondrous subtlety of the supreme vehicle, the mystery of the void and empty *qi*, the dharma gate of unobstructed cavernous observation, and the profound inquiry into returning to the origin from the end. It is the swift path beyond birth and death, the essential ford to transcend the world.

The reader of this sutra must not cling to the literal words but should grasp the meaning beyond the phrases. If one silently awakens to it, attaining realization on one’s own, one directly enters the true realm of the void, roaming together in the primordial before Heaven. Hence, it is called *Perfection Sutra*.

Movement within movement arises from non-movement. Action within action arises from non-action. Master Hengqu said: *"Movement has no stillness, stillness has no movement—this is the realm of things. Movement has stillness, stillness has movement—this is the realm of spirit."* Laozi said: *"Non-action accomplishes everything."*

I say: Movement within non-movement is true movement; action within non-action is true action. When spirit returns, the myriad things flourish in stillness; when *qi* dissolves, the myriad things cease to arise.

Laozi said: *"The ten thousand things flourish, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness."* The Buddha said: *"When the mind ceases, the myriad dharmas cease."* I say: Conceal the spirit in the absolute realm, and the ten thousand things flourish yet do not move. Rest in the inner void, and the ten thousand things are still and cease to arise.

Spirit responds to spirit; things nourish one another. The *Appended Judgments* states: *"Production without end is called the Dao."* I say: Spirit moving spirit, things moving things—all are without end. Their root returns to the origin, silently awakening to it.

The *Appended Judgments* says: *"Silently it is accomplished, wordlessly it is trusted."* I say: Preserving the True One at the root of the tree is called the origin; preserving the True One at the tip of the tree is called the branch. Those who comprehend through spirit and intention can fathom the root and awaken to the origin.

I plant it myself, entering the gapless. The *Appended Judgments* states: *"The sage uses this to cleanse the mind, retiring and concealing it in secrecy."* I say: "Plant" means to bury and conceal. Entrusting the body to the absolute realm enables entry into the domain of the gapless—neither dying nor living, becoming one with Heaven and Earth.

The *Appended Judgments* says: *"Returning to the origin from the end, thus knowing the discourse on life and death."* The *Heart Sutra* states: *"Neither arising nor ceasing."* I say: Life and death are the constant alternation of day and night. Day and night follow their own course; life and death follow theirs. One who sees thus becomes one with Heaven and Earth.

**Right Practice of the True Chapter**
Non-movement within movement, non-action within action—this is the essence of practicing the true. Spirit returning and *qi* dissolving, mutually receiving and nourishing—this is the function of practicing the true. Returning to the root and planting oneself, becoming one with Heaven and Earth—this is the sagely achievement of practicing the true.

**Transmission of the Chapter on Entering Sagehood**

*Ode:*
Spirit moves within the unmoving,
Dao acts through non-action’s place.
Who discerns that which moves within movement—
All primordial creation returns to It.

Forget the eyes, and radiance overflows without bound;
Still the ears, and the mind’s knowing abides in profound depth.
Laozi says: *"Without gazing through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven; without stepping beyond the door, one knows all under Heaven."*
I say: When the eyes do not see, spirit-light shines universally; when the ears do not hear outwardly, the mind’s knowing becomes vast and deep.
Both faculties forgotten, pure and complete—
One merges with the Great Square.
Vast and boundless, one merges with the measureless.

*The Book of Songs* says: *"Unknowing, unperceiving, following the Decree of the Lord."*
The ancient worthies said: *"Vast and undifferentiated."*
*The Scripture of Salvation* says: *"The boundless Great Brahmā, empty and lightless."*
I say: Seeing without seeing, hearing without hearing—
Pure in purity, complete in wholeness.
Body surrendered to stillness, mind merged in oneness—
Thus one transcends past and present, emerges beyond all measure.

Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they are upheld by me;
Though the ten thousand things are multitudinous, they are sustained by me.
*The Appended Judgments* says: *"No model is greater than Heaven and Earth."*
Mencius says: *"All things are complete within me."*
I say: Heaven moves and Earth is still, yet I grasp their totality.
The ten thousand things, though many, are unified in the One.
How could there be an end to this? To speak of exhaustion is folly.
The former scholars said: *"Heaven, Earth, and all beings cannot be exhausted."*
If words could exhaust it, would that not be folly?
I say: Unified by the One, its principle is naturally complete.

**Right Chapter on Entering Sagehood**
Forget the eyes and still the ears—
Form and sound become unobstructed,
And one merges with Heaven and Earth as one.
If there is obstruction among the ten thousand things,
One has not attained the principle.
Those who deeply attain the principle unify it with the One.
Grasping the Three Powers, they endure long.

Thus follows the **Chapter on Abiding in the World**.

*Ode:*
Hearing and seeing without end are delusion;
Following form and sound is but dust.
Grasping both principles leads to sagehood—
Through deep cultivation and effort, one attains perfect reality.

Nurture the imageless, and images endure;
Guard the formless, and the body remains whole.
Laozi says: *"The greatest image is without form."*
And again: *"Exclude the body, and the body endures."*
I say: The image of no-image is the true image, thus it remains unharmed through kalpas.
The body of no-body is the true body, thus it preserves its original reality.
When wholeness and reality support each other, one may endure long.

The former scholars said: *"Pure and without falsity."*
I say: Purity is called wholeness; without falsity is called reality.
Wholeness and reality supporting each other—
This is the Way of long life and enduring vision.
Heaven attains its reality and thus endures long;
Earth attains its reality and thus abides.
Laozi says: *"That by which Heaven and Earth endure long is that they do not live for themselves."*
I say: Not living for oneself is forgetting form—
Thus one preserves one’s original reality and endures as long as Heaven and Earth.
The reason people do not attain long life is that they lose the imageless and scatter the formless.

*The Diamond Sutra* says: *"All conditioned things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows."*
I say: Dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows—
Though they have form, they ultimately dissolve.
Thus, attachment to form and body is all delusion and illusion, destined to decay.
Unable to make the hundred bones and nine orifices coexist with the true body, one dies.

Master Kai said: *"As soon as one engages with being or non-being, one forfeits body and life."*
I say: The reason people do not attain long life is greed and attachment.
Those who cling to thoughts are turned by material desires—
Thus they transform with things and cannot make the hundred bones and nine orifices coexist with the true body, so they die.

**Right Chapter on Abiding in the World**
Nurture the imageless, guard the formless—thus one endures long.
Those who cling lose their original reality—thus they perish early.
What has form ultimately decays; what is formless endures.
The ten thousand beings return to the One without form—thus one preserves one’s original reality.
The One without form returns to the ten thousand beings—thus one loses one’s original reality.
Those who relinquish that and embrace this are called *perfected ones*—
They may preserve form and abide in the world, attaining long life and enduring vision.

Yet beyond this lies the Way of transcending the world and attaining non-birth.
Ah!
The illusory body, having form, ultimately decays;
The Dharma-body, being formless, endures forever.
When both form and formlessness are utterly emptied—
Only then is one the Thusness, the Unmoving Honored One.
