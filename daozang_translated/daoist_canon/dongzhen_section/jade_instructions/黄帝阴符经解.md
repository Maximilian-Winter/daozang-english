**Preface to the *Yin Fu Jing* Commentary**

Man is born between Heaven and Earth.
His form is bestowed by his parents,
His **qi** received from yin and yang,
And his body bears all things.

Yet his body aligns with **Dao/Way** in response to phenomena,
And what is profoundly resonant within the human heart
Is none other than the *Yin Fu Jing*.

In ancient times, after the death of **Pouxi** (the mythical culinary sage),
**Shennong** (the Divine Farmer) emerged,
And the Yellow Emperor composed **book-contracts** (written records),
Commanding **Cangjie** (the legendary inventor of Chinese characters)
To observe the forms of birds and beasts,
The patterns of Heaven and Earth,
And employ the symbols of all things
To create writing—
Thus did the **ghosts and spirits weep**,
And **Dao/Way** first revealed its profound mysteries?

**Dao/Way**, once transformed into **affairs** (practical applications),
Then into **mechanisms** (strategic principles),
And the deployment of these mechanisms—
The highest reveals **moral virtue/power** and governance,
The middle offers **techniques for preserving life and body**,
The lowest expounds on **conquest and national stability**,
Comprehensive yet without omission.

At that time,
The Yellow Emperor, the **first ancestor of Daoism**,
Desiring to propagate the **authentic Daoist teachings**,
Received from **Yuan Nü** (the Primordial Maiden) over three hundred words,
And further expounded with a hundred more,
Summarizing the **ultimate principles of all transformations**,
Uniting the **mysteries of all spirits**,
Concealing the profound and subtle,
Embracing Heaven and encompassing Earth—
Its **precepts are concise**, its **meanings profound**,
Its **logic deep**, its **principles unfathomable**,
For those who attain **self-realization** through **Dao/Way**.

I have examined the commentaries of various scholars,
Yet their interpretations diverge in doctrine,
Their explanations rooted in partial perspectives,
Only recognizing the *Yin Fu Jing* as the Yellow Emperor’s **authoritative teachings**,
Not acknowledging **Yuan Nü’s** transmission.

However, the *Inner Transmission* records:
The Yellow Emperor received from **Yuan Nü** the **essence of the *Yin Fu Jing***,
Mastering the **inner harmony with Heaven’s mechanisms**,
And the **outer alignment with human affairs**—
Thus the **three hundred words** were indeed **Yuan Nü’s** transmission,
While the **hundred words** were the Yellow Emperor’s **elaboration**.

Hence, its **language is succinct yet its intent vast**,
Its **meanings profound**, its **principles deep**—
Observe its **strange instruments**,
Which **generate all phenomena**,
The **Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems**,
The **divine mechanisms and hidden secrets**—
The **art of yin and yang overcoming each other** is clearly revealed beyond mere symbols.

To comprehend this is to exhaust the *Yin Fu Jing*’s meaning—
Later generations cannot surpass it.
When **Confucius** lectured on the *Yijing* (I Ching)
And expounded its **appended commentary** (*Shi Ci*),
The **Dao/Way of the *Yijing*** was fully elucidated—
Truly, **books cannot exhaust speech, nor speech exhaust meaning**—
What more can be said?

Thus, I boldly **pruned the old commentaries**,
And **composed new annotations**,
Ensuring **verification and practical application** without error.

Moreover, the **Yellow Old School** (referring to Yellow Emperor and Laozi)
Established its teachings:
**Dao/Way** values **gathering the void**,
Lofty discourse and sweeping principles,
Detached from worldly conventions and customs,
Not enticing the **profane** with superficial explanations,
But revealing only the **core insights of the sages**.

Those who **contemplate its intent** grasp its **multifaceted wonders**,
And the **erudite** attain its **subtle profundities**—
Its **precepts originate from the Three Sovereigns**,
Its **teachings extend through all ages**,
Enriching the **strategies of benevolent rulers**,
Supplying the **tools of virtuous ministers**.

From the **Qin and Han dynasties** above,
To the **Sui and Tang dynasties** below,
Generals and eminent ministers,
Ascetics and **recluse Daoists**,
Those who annotated and commented on it are innumerable.

Now, the *Yin Fu Jing*’s **application** lies in **Heaven’s mechanisms**—
If it **resonates within the heart**,
How could it be called a **minor supplement**?

**Shi Changchen** humbly composes this preface.

**The *Yin Fu Jing*’s Historical Account**

In ancient times, the **Western Queen Mother** descended upon **Wangwu Mountain**,
Granting the Yellow Emperor **martial arts**,
And he **defeated Chi You** in the **Zhuolu wilderness**,
Exterminating **demonic chaos**,
Eliminating **heavenly calamities**.

Then he **governed the states and clans**,
Established **shrines and ancestral altars**,
Allotted **lands and territories**,
And appointed **feudal lords**—
The **Five Phases** (elements) were fixed,
And **great bandits** were eradicated.

The Queen Mother sent **Yuan Nü** again
To transmit the Yellow Emperor **secret precepts**—
Nineteen chapters of the *Inner Transmission*,
And the *Yin Fu Jing*’s **three hundred words**—
Including **alchemical formulas for gold elixirs and jade seals**,
**Talismans that soar through the void**,
**Methods of traversing fire and walking on water**—
All were fully encompassed.

The Yellow Emperor then **established the Bureau of Welcoming Immortals**,
**Refined the essentials of ascension**,
And **revealed sacred texts and secret scriptures**
To broaden **Daoist teachings**—
Thus all within the **Six Realms** (Heaven, Earth, and the four directions)
Were **beneficially guided**.

From **Dongting Lake**, he **rode a fire dragon** and ascended,
His **sword and sandals buried** by his ministers at **Bashan Mountain**—
The records clearly attest to this.

This **scripture** was transmitted to posterity,
So that later ages might **embody and practice** it—
Thus the **benevolent** see it as **benevolence**,
And the **wise** see it as **wisdom**.

Those who **awaken to its truths**,
Generally grasp the **sequential principles of Dao/Way and techniques**
To **manifest virtue and conceal practical applications**;
Those who **peruse its logic**,
Attain **self-realization** through **Dao/Way**.

**Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing***

**Shi Changchen**, **Deputy Keeper of the Jianlong Daoist Observatory**,
And **Purple-Robed Master of Preservation and Peace**,
Now elucidates the *Yin Fu Jing*:

**Chapter on the Embracing of One by Immortals and Daoists**
*"Preserve essence and safeguard **qi**—
The **spirit** then abides.
To attain **Dao/Way** and not die—
This is called **ascension (xian)**."*

Thus, the **Dao/Way of immortals and Daoists**
Resonates with humanity like **valley spirits**,
As **Laozi** described: *"Valley spirits do not die."*

What man **preserves** is his **spirit**,
What he **encounters** is **transformation**—
To **embrace One** means all things
**Carry yin while embracing yang**,
Hence it is called *"**Dao/Way** generates One."*

Though **numbers** extend to **ten thousand billions**,
They all **originate from One**—
This chapter seeks to **broadly transmit and comprehensively elucidate**
Like a **moon reflected in water**,
**Manifesting without fail.**

Thus, it is **marked as the first chapter**.

**To observe Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,
And to **grasp Heaven’s actions**—
This is exhaustive.**

Heaven’s **Dao/Way** flows and **accumulates nowhere**,
Thus all things **generate**.
Hence, **phenomena have forms** that can be observed,
**Dao/Way is formless** yet can be **attained**—
If **phenomena** are **self-perceived**,
Then to **know Heaven’s actions**,
Silently **respond to transformation**—
This is to **grasp Heaven’s actions**.

**Actions** refer to the **unfixed states**,
Thus **Dao/Way’s** **cyclical rotation** like a **hinge**—
Only when one **finds its center**,
Does one **achieve its boundlessness**;
**Heaven** is **vast and complete**,
Encompassing all spirits,
**Guarding through emptiness**,
**Rooting in tranquility**—
If man’s heart is **like the Great Emptiness**,
And **touches phenomena in alignment with **Dao/Way**,
Unobstructed by **material fixation**,
And **unmoved**—
Then **phenomena** will **respond without fail**,
And **self and phenomena** will **both be forgotten**—
Thus one **attains the profound mysteries**."

「Thus, one who possesses the innate quality to receive the **Dao/Way**,
Shall have **no intent**, **no fixed certainty**, **no rigidity**, **no self**—
When **actions** align with **divine resonance**,
Left and right, one finds its source—
This is how the **Sage** achieves **non-action** yet **nothing left undone**.

For indeed, such a one **fully** and **exhaustively** grasps it.
From this perspective,
The **observer** observes with the **heart**, not with the **eyes**,
The **holder** grasps with the **heart**, not with the **hands**—
**Without observation or fixation**,
**Heaven’s actions** are **attained**.

**Heaven** has five **thieves**—
Those who recognize them flourish.
The principles of **things** are:
**Thieves of merit** (功),
**Thieves of skill** (巧),
**Thieves of timing** (時),
**Thieves of substance** (物),
**Thieves of life** (命)—
All are **Heaven’s** doing,
Not what man can **force**.

Yet **Great Yu** stole **merit**,
**Gongshu Ban** stole **skill**,
**Confucius** stole **timing**,
**Fan Li** stole **substance**,
**Laozi and Pengzu** stole **life**—
Thus the **thieves** are **takers**.
These five masters **understood Heaven’s resonance**,
And thus they became **Internal Saints and Outer Kings**.

The five **thieves**—
Metaphorically speaking,
In **Heaven** they are the **Five Stars**,
On earth they are the **Five Sacred Mountains**,
In man they are the **Five Zang Organs**—
Broadly considered,
Their methods **internalized**,
In **Dao** are called **Xian** (仙),
In **Confucianism** are called **Yuan** (元).
Taking from afar,
They are **external things**;
Taking from near,
They are **internal desires**.
The **central master** of **internal desires**,
The **heart** enslaved by **external appearances**—
Even dwelling in mountains and forests yet **not inwardly at rest**,
Is called **sitting idleness** (坐驰),
And one **loses their natural authenticity** (天真),
For they **do not perceive** the **essence** of the five **thieves**,
And **internal heat** disturbs their chest—
**Zhuangzi** called this **burning their Heavenly Harmony** (天和).

Man’s nature and inclinations vary—
What pleases one displeases another,
What suits one does not suit another,
Each **fixates** on their **partial view**,
Unable to **respond** to the **unbounded**—
Thus those who **recognize** them become **fully accomplished masters**.

**Actions** must **perceive resonance**,
Thus one can **command things**,
Not be **enslaved** by them.
If **Dao/Way** is the **sovereign ruler**,
And one **does not follow things**,
Then the metaphor of the five **thieves** applies to the **immediate world**—
The **heart** perceives them,
And they lie **within one’s grasp**—
If one **uses them well**, they become the **Five Powers** (五德),
If one **uses them poorly**, they become the **Five Thieves**—
Thus one **flourishes**.

The five **thieves** dwell in the **heart**,
Yet their **manifestations** extend to **Heaven**—
Their **functions** are **applied** across **Heaven, Earth, and Man**,
Yet they **never cease** to be present,
Only **restrained by the heart**—
Thus **Dao/Way** is in **things**,
The **heart** is in the **body**—
**Dao/Way** does not **follow things**,
The **heart** does not **move with the body**,
Then it is **firmly unshakable**.

Such are those with **Dao/Way**,
Who **govern before chaos arises**,
And **preserve the realm before peril comes**.

One **resonance** moves, and a hundred **spirits** follow—
Is **Heaven** so distant?
How **profound** is it?
The **heart’s** reach, when **perceiving resonance**,
**Aligns with Heaven**—
What **distance** is there, then?

This is how the **heart’s** **operations** unfold.

The **cosmos** lies within the **hand**,
All **transformations** arise from the **body**—
The **light and pure** belong to **Heaven**,
The **heavy and turbid** belong to **Earth**,
The **cosmos** is the **ultimate** of **up and down**.

How can the **cosmos** be **held** in the **hand**?
**Laozi** said:
*"Grasp the **Great Form** (大象),
And **all under Heaven** will **come forward** (往)."*
The **hand**—
**Dominates Heaven and Earth**,
**Cycles through Yin and Yang**,
**Oversees** the **Dao/Way’s** **movement** like **turning a wheel**—
Truly, the **cosmos** lies within the **hand**.

The **Immortal** also said:
*"There are those who perceive the **resonance of Creation** (造化机),
With their **hands** they **grasp** the **sun and moon**,
Stable as **furnaces** within their **bodies**—
Like **knocking on a mystical door**,
**Relying on the artisan’s skill**—
This speaks of **profound mysteries**, beyond **explicit words**."*

All **transformations**—
The **collective name** for **things**—
Yet it is said they **arise from the body**,
For the **body** is the **substance of life**,
And man is the **spirit** of all **things**—
The **body** **contains** the **qi** of **Heaven and Earth**,
And the **Four Great Elements** (空中四大) are **all encompassed** within it.

The **head** is **round**, mirroring **Heaven**,
The **feet** are **square**, mirroring **Earth**,
The **center** is **harmonious**—the **body**—
The **body** is **one with Heaven and Earth**.

As **Liezi** said:
*"Between **Heaven and Earth**, a single **thread**—
Is it not that all **transformations** arise from the **body**?"*
To **observe the body**,
One can **know** the **arising of all transformations**.

**Heaven’s** nature is **humanity** (人也),
The **human heart** is **resonance** (機也).
**Wealth and honor** are what man **desires**,
**Poverty and lowliness** are what man **abhors**.
Man’s nature—
**To love life and hate death**,
**To seek benefit and avoid harm**—
All are **bestowed by Heaven**.

As when man **pursues a principle**,
**Awakens to a method**,
**Completes a matter**—
It is through **practice** that they **attain** it.
Thus **Heaven’s** **endowment** of nature,
**No one attains without seeking**—
The **heart** holds **far-reaching aspirations**,
**Cultivating the body** to **achieve** them.

The **vulgar** call this **delusive thinking** (妄想),
Yet they **do not know** that **delusive thinking** is the **ladder** to **Dao/Way**—
Thus **Heaven’s** nature is **made by man**,
And the **human heart** is **driven by resonance**—
When man **dwells in stillness**, it is the **heart**,
When man **moves**, it is the **resonance**—
How much more so when **Heaven’s resonance** is **triggered**,
And one can **sit and advance** into this **Dao/Way**,
How can it be **compared** to those who **merely prattle**?

Thus the **nature of man** is **known**.

**Establish Heaven’s Dao/Way**,
To **settle humanity**—
**Heaven’s Dao/Way** is **still** while **humanity’s Dao/Way** is **active**,
**Active** aligns with **Yang’s virtue/power**,
**Still** aligns with **Yin’s essence**—
**Motionless and tranquil**,
Yet **stirred** and **immediately responsive**—
The **Sage** **receives humanity with emptiness**,
And thus can **reflect back**.

**Humanity’s Dao/Way** is **easily moved** yet **hard to still**,
To **know its stillness** is to **align with Heaven**—
As **Laozi** said:
*"Returning to the **root** is called **stillness**,
**Stillness** is called **restoring life** (复命)."*
To **be settled** then to **respond**,
Is to **exhaust principles** and **fulfill nature**.

Thus **establishing Heaven’s Dao/Way** to **guide humanity**,
If man **knows Heaven’s silent operations**,
Then he can **embody transformation** and **discard worldly filth**,
The **heart** like a **clear mirror**,
**Responsive** without end,
**Playing with Heaven’s Dao/Way**—
In **humanity’s Dao/Way**, what **distance** remains?

When **Heaven** **triggers** the **resonance of killing**,
**Dragons and snakes** rise onto **land**.
When **man** **triggers** the **resonance of killing**,
**Heaven and Earth** **reverse and overturn**.
When **Heaven and man** **trigger together**,
All **changes** are **fixed by resonance**—
**Heaven and man’s Dao/Way** are **distant** yet **respond nearby**,
**Moving with the times**—
This is to **respond to Heaven** and **follow humanity**.

If one **does not grasp the times** yet **acts**,
They will **never** **meet resonance** or **embrace transformation**—
And indeed,
Within the **Four Great Elements** of the **world**,
Even **Heaven**, the **highest**, **dares not** **arbitrarily trigger** in man,
For fear **dragons and snakes** will rise onto **land**."

「Thus, dragons **conceal** themselves in **water**,
snakes **hide** in **marshes**,
but when they do not **conceal** and **cross** onto **land**,
this **reveals** Heaven’s **triggering**.

Man, if he **does not grasp** the **times of Heaven** yet **acts**,
then Heaven and Earth **become obscured and darkened**,
and **yin-yang** **err in sequence**,
turning day into night to **warn** of man’s **arbitrary triggering**.

Thus, Heaven **acts** through man,
and man **acts** through Heaven’s **times**—
if man **discerns the resonance** and **acts with the times**,
even **ghosts and spirits** **dare not** **fathom** his **intentions**,
and **yin-yang** **dare not** **know** his **mysteries**.
His **commands and orders** will **never** be **in vain**—
this is called **harmonious triggering**.

When man’s **resonance** **aligns with Dao/Way**,
and he **silently contracts** with Heaven’s **true nature**,
then the **Three Powers** **fix** their **positions**,
and the **Five Agents** **lift** their **functions**.
As in ancient times when the **Eight Hundred Lords** gathered at **Mengjin’s banks**,
was this not also called **Heaven and man’s harmonious triggering**?

Those who **master the Dao of governance** must **not** **cling to tradition** to **achieve alignment**,
but **investigate ancient precedents** to **apply** them,
**accumulate merit** through **action** to **seek** it—
then they will **not** lose their **purpose**.

Indeed, the **still** yet **sage**,
and the **active** yet **kingly**,
these **are** those whose **Dao/Way** **harmonizes** with **Heaven and man**—
Heaven **does not defy** them,
and **how much less** would man?

This is the **time of Heaven and man’s harmonious triggering**.

**Nature** has **skill and clumsiness**—
it can be **concealed** or **revealed**.
The **nature of skill and clumsiness** lies in man—
it can be **bent** or **extended**,
**acting** when the **resonance** is **discerned**,
**concealing** his **vessel** within the **body**,
**waiting** for the **times** to **act**,
so that men **see** his **manifestation** but **not** his **concealment**.

Indeed, there are those who **find their own field**,
and yet **preserve** their **body** and **avoid harm** so as to **escape** regret—
what **more** could the **virtuous/powerful** need?

Thus it is said:
*The state’s **precious instruments***
**must not** be **shown** to the people.
Then the **greatest skill** appears as **clumsiness**,
and **deep concealment** is **not** **abhorred**.
When **turned** and **used**,
this becomes **noble**.

The **nine orifices’** **harmful tendencies** lie in the **Three Essentials**,
and can be **governed by stillness and motion**.
The **ancient sages** set **sight and hearing**, **eating and breathing**, and **great and small** as the **nine orifices**,
and **established the Three Essentials** to **guard** their **stillness and motion**,
so as **not** to lose their **true nature**.
Indeed, the **master** of one **body** lies only in the **heart**’s **Nine Essentials**—
thus it is said: *the heart’s **harmful tendencies** lie in the **Three Essentials**.*

Therefore, those who **cultivate qi** and **nourish the heart**,
must **upright** their **body’s essentials**,
**straighten** their **intentions’ essentials**,
and **balance** their **heart’s essentials**—
this is the **governance of the Three Essentials of the heart**,
not the **nine orifices** of **ears, eyes, mouth, and nostrils**.

Stillness and motion **rest** in man,
and **qi** **makes** them so.
**Hold** your **resonance** firm,
**do not** **exhaust** your **qi**;
**upright** your **heart**,
**do not** **indulge** its **harmful tendencies**.
Thus, the *Three Hundred Poems*,
in one **phrase** **summed up**,
say: *Think not of harmful tendencies*.

This is truly **nourishing** one’s **innate true nature**.

**Fire** **arises** from **wood**,
and **disaster** **triggered** must **overcome**.
**Deceit** **arises** from the **state**,
and **resonance** **triggered** must **break**.

To **know** and **refine** it is called **sagehood**.
Indeed, **wood** **generates fire**,
but **fire** **overcomes wood** in return—
**man** **generates deeds**,
but **deeds** **betray man** in return.
Thus the **analogy of fire and wood** **holds**.

Man’s **ignorance** **accumulates** **anger-qi**,
and he **does not** **self-regulate**,
**internally consuming** Heaven’s **harmony** and **bringing about** his **end**.
If such a man **discerns** the **natural furnace and tripod**,
and **refines** it within his **body**,
then his **virtue/power** becomes **true**.

Such a man **can embody** Heaven’s **law** and **follow** the Dao/Way,
**making** the **state** **free of deceitful ministers**,
and his **self** **free of false actions**.
Yet even those **near** the **sages** **still** **err** and **lose** it;
**how much farther** are those who **aspire** to **sagehood**?

Heaven **gives life** and **takes life**—
this is the **principle** of the Dao/Way.
When **things** **arrive unexpectedly**, it is called **life**;
when **things** **depart**, it is called **death**.
**Life** is the **sprouting** of **spring**,
**death** is the **falling** of **autumn**.
Man’s **life** is **one qi** **gathered**,
and man’s **death** is **one qi** **dispersed**—
thus, **things** and **man** **arrive and depart**, **live and die**, **never ceasing**.

This is the **principle** of the Dao/Way **manifesting** thus.
**Rise and fall** of **all things**,
**birth and death** of **man**—
yet these are the **inevitable** **principles** of **Heaven and Earth**, **yin and yang**.

**Life and death** **alternate and transform**—
the **common** and **sage** **both know** this,
so **not** **obscuring** the **soul’s origin**,
**following** **things’ shifts**,
one **aligns** with the **Emperor of the Forms**,
and **who** could **compare** to the **son of the Xiè clan**?

Indeed, the **constancy** of **life and death**,
like **sleep and wakefulness**,
has **always existed** from antiquity.

**Enriching the state** and **settling the people**—
**applying** the **principles of the Dao/Way**.

To **enrich the state** is to **provide for the body**,
to **settle the people** is to **restrain desires**.

Heaven and Earth **are thieves** of **all things**,
**all things are thieves** of **man**,
and **man is a thief** of **all things**.
When the **three thefts** **are apt**,
then the **Three Powers** **are settled**.

Heaven and Earth **nurture** **all things**,
sometimes **giving life**, sometimes **taking life**;
**all things** **steal** from Heaven and Earth,
yet **neither give nor take life**;
**man steals** from **all things**,
yet **both gives and takes life**.

Man **steals** from **all things** to **provide sustenance**—
this is how **Heaven, Earth, and man** **successively exchange** and **complete** one another.
The **Three Powers** **are** **cyclical harmony**.

Thus, Heaven, Earth, **all things**, and man **together** **bring forth** **changes**,
and it is said:
*The three thefts, if apt,*
*then the Three Powers are settled.*

Thus it is said:
*Eat in season,*
*and the hundred limbs **are in order**.*
*Trigger the resonance,*
*and the ten thousand changes **are settled**.*

*To eat* is to **receive qi**,
and *resonance* is **Heaven’s times** and **Earth’s advantages**.
If **eating** **loses** its **season**,
then the **hundred limbs** **fall ill**.
If **resonance** is **light** in **affairs**,
then **speech** **will** **be perilous**.

The *ten thousand changes* are the *ten thousand states*.
If the **ruler** **is clear**,
then the *ten thousand states* **are settled**,
and if **man’s heart** **is harmonious**,
then **all ties** **cease**.

Indeed, the **Dao of nourishing life** and the **principles of governance**,
**are one and the same**.
Man **knows** his **spirit** and thus **is spirit**,
but **does not know** what **is not spirit** and thus **is spirit**.
The **spirit** **is** **marvelous** and **boundless**—
man **cannot** **know** what it **does**.

It **is spirit** while **man does not know** that it **is spirit**—
then **man** and **spirit** **are** **presence and absence**.
Man **has** presence and **absence**,
and **spirit** **has absence** yet **presence**—
presence and absence **without presence**,
this is **man** and **spirit** **sharing** the **total emergence** from the **heart’s depths**.

**Submerge** in **Heaven** and **Heaven** **responds**,
**submerge** in **Earth** and **Earth** **responds**—
only the **heart’s spirit** **can** **do** this.

When **sincerity** **reaches its utmost**,
the **spirit** **is moved** by man,
thus the **spirit** **is boundless**.
It **responds** in **things** and **things respond**,
and in **man** and **man responds**—
**embodying** all **ten thousand dharmas**,
**present everywhere**,
**eyes witness** and the **Dao/Way** **remains**—
this is the **work** of the **spirit**.」

The sun and moon have their measures, the great and small have their fixed limits.
From this, the **saint’s** virtue arises, and the **divine clarity** emerges.
The sun is the accumulation of the moon,
the moon is the accumulation of the year—
twelve months form a year.
When days exhaust their sequence,
and months exhaust their cycles,
three hundred sixty days are fixed as a complete year.
Sometimes, the great and small are adjusted
to balance the waxing and waning of yin and yang,
thus every five years, an intercalary month is added twice
to supplement the deficiencies of the celestial cycle.
Hence, the **saint’s** virtue and **divine clarity** arise from this,
and hence they emerge.
Thus, among men, there are distinctions of noble and base, wise and foolish,
yet only those who attain the **Dao/Way** can escape the **cycle of *jiǎzǐ*** [1].
The **cycle of *jiǎzǐ*** is the grand tally of Heaven and Earth,
where the **saint’s** virtue is molded,
and **divine clarity** is cast.
The sequence governs all living things,
making rulers and subjects, fathers and sons, husbands and wives,
and all things return to their proper order.
It is said that every thousand years, a **sage** is born,
and every five hundred years, a worthy one appears—
how could this not depend on the molding of the **divine** and the casting of the **saintly**?

The *Zhuangzi* states:
*"Heaven and Earth produce the noble man,
and the noble man governs Heaven and Earth."*
Those who discuss the **Dao/Way** and govern the state,
harmonizing yin and yang—
this is not something mere mortals can achieve;
it is the work of the **saint’s** virtue and **divine clarity**.

As for seizing the **opportunity** [*jī*],
no one in the world can see it,
no one can know it.
The noble man, when he attains it, preserves himself;
the petty man, when he attains it, risks his life.
The **opportunity** is the shift between gain and loss.
It governs whether Heaven and Earth, all things, and men
thrive or decline, rise or fall, suffer loss or gain,
what is permissible or forbidden, flourishing or decay—
all are variations of the **opportunity**.
Thus, to seize the **opportunity** is to usurp the workings of creation in one’s breast,
to pluck the cosmos into one’s palm.
Hence, those whose deeds are beyond measure yet succeed—
it is the **opportunity** that makes it so.

Above, it fulfills the **sovereign’s** duties;
in the middle, it upholds the **minister’s** path;
below, it governs the **family’s** discipline.
Applied to the Three Powers [*sān cái*],
it brings all to fruition.

The grand aligns with Heaven and Earth’s vastness,
the minute divides like the finest hair—
neither stagnant nor tranquil,
neither murky nor luminous—
what is called *"grinding without dulling,
dying without staining"*—
this is the subtlety of the **opportunity**.

Thus, the world’s things have forms that can be observed,
and men can see them.
But the **opportunity**’s thief leaves no trace—
the masses cannot perceive it.
Hence, if the **opportunity**’s work is not kept secret, disaster follows.

The noble man preserves himself by attaining the **opportunity**;
the petty man risks his life by losing it.
The vulgar masses, blinded by their nature,
do not know the use of seizing the **opportunity**—
thus, the preservation of life and the risking of it
are made manifest between the noble and the petty.

**Chapter on Strong Arms and Victorious Strategy**
Warfare is the foundation of the state—
it can be made strong, but not weak.
To fight and win is to overcome the enemy.
The ruler wields the awe of the three armies,
yet does not use them to pacify the world.
Establishing the foundation of eternal peace
depends on the strength of the arms.
When the arms can meet the enemy and win,
these are the state’s arms.
But the arms of men are otherwise.

Laozi said that the finest arms are
an inauspicious instrument.
Not the tool of the noble,
they are used only when there is no alternative,
with serenity as the highest principle.
The **opportunity** in warfare lies in victory without glory.
But to glory in it is to delight in killing,
and such cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world—
this is the folly of men’s arms in underestimating the enemy.
Underestimating the enemy nearly loses one’s treasure,
and failing to wage war properly loses the true source—
after great campaigns, there will surely be years of calamity.

The *Huángtíng Nèijǐng* says:
*"Long life requires utmost caution in the chamber’s arts—
how can one die and make the spirit weep?
This **Dao/Way** is the thief of life,
only the Yellow Emperor and Lao Peng mastered it well."*

When the **body-army** faces the battlefield,
the general must be steady—
thus, speak in terms of funeral rites,
govern with the **Dao/Way**,
and words can be controlled.
Prevent disorder before it arises,
and safeguard the state before it is in peril.
After battle, the *yin-demons* are subdued,
and treasures fill the hall—
yet it is said:
*"Gold and jade fill the hall,
but none can guard them."*
Those who embody the **Dao/Way**—
their **body-army** is within themselves,
and this should be known.

The blind excel in hearing,
the deaf excel in seeing.
Cutting off one source of gain,
the army’s strength is tenfold;
threefold reflection on day and night,
the army’s strength is ten thousandfold.
Though the blind and deaf lack full hearing and sight,
they do not listen with their ears nor see with their eyes—
they listen inwardly with the heart,
and their spirit is singularly focused.
Thus it is said:
*"Cut off one source of gain,
and the strength becomes tenfold;
if further reflected upon,
it can rival ten thousandfold."*

Now, men possess all six senses,
ten faculties complete—
yet even with sight and hearing,
they cannot fully preserve their ears and eyes,
nor match the blind and deaf in true focus.
The **army** is the multitude.
Though men have full ears and eyes,
they all lose themselves to external sight and sound.
Are those people deficient in ears and eyes, like the blind and deaf?
Or do they, through inner attainment, forget ears and eyes,
and thus truly see and hear?

Hence, the **Perfect Man**’s heart is like a mirror—
clear and untainted by external dust,
receptive yet without attachment.
The heart is born from things,
dies from things—
the **opportunity** lies in the eyes.
To govern the five senses from the empty center—
this is the heart.
Only the heart is the source of all dharmas.
The time of life is not as precious as the time before birth—
why?
Those who live are enslaved by the heart,
driven to move at the sight of gain,
to ponder at the sight of fame,
to compete for wealth,
to lust at the sight of beauty—
all are things ensnaring the heart,
preventing the fulfillment of one’s true potential,
and leading to untimely death.
From this, it is seen:
man’s life and death are determined by the heart,
yet before birth, there was none of this.

Laozi said:
*"Fill the belly, not the eyes—
make inner observation replace outer vision,
and prevent external stimuli from disturbing the heart."*
When one attains the **Law** and becomes a **sage**,
awakens to the **Dao/Way** and becomes true—
how could one reach or awaken without abandoning the heart?
The **opportunity** lies in the eyes,
for the heart, dwelling within, responds to the external world.

The heavens bestow no favor yet great favor arises.
The **Celestial Globe** (璇玑) and **Heavenly Motion** (斡运) unfold,
the **Dao/Way** (大道) is **originally empty** (元虚),
yet no single thing is added to its favor—
it is favor itself.

Thus, all things **spontaneously transform** (職職),
arising from **non-action** (無為).
The **root of favor** (植而恩者) is the **function of transformation** (化物之功).
When things bear fruit,
it is through the **order of the Dao/Way** (大道之序),
for what need does heaven speak?

The four seasons proceed,
ten thousand things flourish—
this is so.
Swift thunder and fierce winds,
none dare disobey.

Swift thunder and fierce winds,
the **mighty force** (威) of the **heavenly spirits** (天神)
shakes and startles the reckless,
commanding them to follow its **decree** (令) above,
so that chaos dares not act below.

Moreover, when one practices **virtue/power** (作德),
the heart finds **ease** (逸) and **rest** (休).
Daily **artifice** (作伪) brings **labor** (劳),
and daily **labor** brings **clumsiness** (拙).
If one hears the thunder’s voice,
the artful cannot help but **brace their chest** (介臆),
while the virtuous remain **unperturbed** (坦然) and **carefree** (无虑).
Thus, the movement of thunder and wind
strikes fear in all—
save the **easeful** (至静).

At the onset of sound,
even the **coagulated and sentient** (含灵)
all **awaken and transform** (蠢动苏变).
**Supreme joy** (至乐) is **excess of nature** (性余),
**supreme stillness** (至静) then **refines** (廉).
Nature (性) is the heart’s birth,
excess of nature is **supreme joy** (至乐);
stillness (静) is the root of nature,
**supreme stillness** (至静) then **manifests refinement** (行廉).

To **release without grasping** (放之而不执)
is to **avoid attachment** (无着) to things in **movement and stillness** (动静),
lest they harm one’s **life** (生).
What is truly **precious** (贵) in man
lies in **supreme refinement** (至廉),
not in **supreme joy** (至乐).

Thus, **supreme joy** (至乐) is **divine** (神);
**clearing and stillness** (清静),
as the **foundation for receiving the Dao/Way** (受道之本),
are the **proper use of the Dao/Way** (正道之用) for all under heaven.

The heavens’ **ultimate particularity** (至私) serves **ultimate universality** (至公).
The **Dao/Way of heaven** (天道) is distant yet **ultimately particular**,
so things can **be contained** (可容);
the **Dao/Way of man** (人道) is near yet **ultimately universal**,
so things cannot **escape** (无逃).
What can be contained is only what the heavens do,
what cannot escape is what **universality governs** (公之所理).

In summary,
**ultimate particularity** and **ultimate universality** exist within the **span of a hand** (反掌之间乎)?
If **released into the Dao/Way** (放之於道),
then the heavens’ **particularity can be transgressed** (可违);
if **applied to man** (使之於人),
only **universality cannot be sheltered** (不可庇).
Why so?

The **Dao/Way** employs **goodness** (善) in its **use** (用),
thus **completing its particularity** (成其私);
**universality** governs with **rectification** (册),
thus **nothing can be avoided** (不可避).
If **ultimate universality** (至公) is not **applied to the people** (加於民),
then the **Dao/Way of man** (人道) is **incomplete** (阙矣);
if **ultimate particularity** (至私) is not **contained within the heavens** (容於天),
then the **principles of things** (物理) are **incomplete** (阙矣).
The **Dao/Way’s use of particularity and universality** (公私之用),
this is the **teaching of good and evil** (善恶之教化).
Thus, the ruler attains it and **fulfills the ruler’s Dao/Way** (尽君道),
the subject attains it and **fulfills the subject’s Dao/Way** (尽臣道),
only then can one **shift customs and ease mores** (移风易俗).

The **scholar of governance** (治道之士) attains it—
**particularity can be maneuvered within the heart** (私可以运于心者),
this is called **"yielding brings completeness"** (曲则全).

The **method of beasts** (禽之制) lies in **qi** (炁).
Two feet and feathers—this is called **beast** (禽).
The **beast** (禽),
its heart is the **Vermilion Bird** (朱雀).
When man possesses **qi** (炁),
**joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure** (喜怒哀乐)
and **taking and discarding** (取舍) control him,
all are things the heart **cannot properly govern** (善制).
When **qi** aligns with **yang** (毗於阳), there is **joy** (喜);
when **qi** aligns with **yin** (毗於阴), there is **anger** (怒).
If one tests this theory,
can **qi** truly be **governed** (制)?
**Qi** (炁) is what it **adapts to** (所适),
the **steed of good and evil** (善恶之马),
or some say the **steed of intention** (意马)—
these are all **useless applications** (无之用).
Only the **heart’s movement** (心之运) is real,
so the **scholar of harmonizing qi** (善炁之士),
having **subdued and tamed the heart** (调伏心),
can **know** (可知) it.

Thus, the **method of governing qi and nourishing the heart** (治炁养心之道) is attained.
When **joy and anger do not alter one’s bearing** (容),
and **prosperity and decline do not change one’s conduct** (操),
then one’s **sovereignty is firmly established** (主宰已定).
Who then can **defame or praise** (毁誉)?
Not following things’ shifts,
this is **ultimate governance of emotions** (制情之至).

**Life** (生) is the **root of death** (死之根),
**death** (死) is the **root of life** (生之根).
**Birth and death** (生死) in man,
like **day and night ceasing not** (昼夜不息).
This **life** (生) is the **foundation of death** (死之本),
for **having life means death** (有生必死);
**death** (死) is also the **foundation of life** (生之本),
for once **death is gone** (既去),
**life must return** (必又生).
Thus, in **emergence and disappearance** (出没),
**drowned in the Six Realms** (溺於六道),
how could there not be **birth without birth and death without death** (生生不死死)?
**Birth and death** (死生) truly have **discourse** (议)?
No—
the **ancient sages** (古圣人) cast them **beyond the Six Extremes** (六合之外),
discussing them yet **not debating** (论而不议).

Now, the **one who does not birth life nor die death** (不生生者),
**sheds this form and body** (脱此形骸),
attains the **Dao/Way and becomes true** (得道成真),
**silently abides in the numinous source** (寂然灵源),
uniting with the **emptiness** (虚空).
They **verify non-action** (证入无为),
**exit the Three Realms** (出三界外),
and **rank with all the true ones** (与诸真列位).
What **life** (生) then remains?

Once **born, death is certain** (既生必死),
yet the **one who does not die death** (不死死),
follows the **nature of freedom** (逍遥之性),
**receives the essence of the dark and obscure** (纳沆瀣之精),
**absorbs wind and drinks dew** (吸风饮露),
**avoids grains to nourish the mists** (辟谷养霞),
**fortifies and perfects the colored body** (坚固色身),
**accumulates three thousand labors** (积三千功),
**and amasses eight hundred deeds** (累八百行).
When **labor is complete and deeds are fulfilled** (功成行满),
one day, with **light exertion** (轻举),
**flies to the Great Void** (飞游大罗),
and **gathers with true immortals** (与真仙会).
This **colored body departs** (色身而去),
what **death** (死) then remains?

**Death must bring life** (死必有生),
this is the **endless cycle** (有无休止).
Laozi said:
*"I have a great affliction—
my having a body* (吾有大患，为吾、有身).
When I have no body,
what affliction then remains?
This is to say—
**not to birth life nor die death** (不生生而不死死).*
The **Dao/Way of man** (人之道) is otherwise,
for it does not **exit the path of birth and death** (出生死之路),
thus **leading to transmigration** (轮回).

**Favor arises from harm** (恩生於害),
**harm arises from favor** (害生於恩).
To **give to others is favor** (施人曰恩),
to **injure others is harm** (残人曰害)—
this is the **reversal of favor and harm** (恩害颠倒).
Those who **follow the Dao/Way** (任道之人),
first **labor their sinews and bones** (劳其筋骨),
**wither their nature** (枯槁其性),
**make movement their stillness** (以动为静),
**use obscurity to attain clarity** (用晦而明)—
this is but **one step removed from the Dao/Way** (去道则一间).

Thus, those who **long dwell in seclusion** (久寓寂寞)
and **ascend to the sage’s threshold** (身登圣人之阃域),
this is **harm birthing favor** (是害生恩);
**favor arising from harm** (恩生於害),
speaks of when man is in **wealth and honor** (富贵之际),
**indulges his actions** (纵其所为),
**follows his desires** (因其所欲),
yet **does not cultivate the self** (而不知修身).
Once the **body is shed** (身既脱去),
the **sage’s spirit** (神圣) is not **taken along** (与提挈),
**scattering into all paths** (散人诸趣)—
can it not be **injurious** (可不伤乎)?
Thus, the **two paths of favor and harm** (恩害二途)
are **not to be overlooked** (不可不察).

The **foolish** (愚人) regard **heaven and earth’s patterns and principles** (天地文理) as **sagehood** (圣),
I regard **time and things’ patterns and principles** (时物文理) as **wisdom** (哲).
Those **blocked by ignorance** (茅塞之徒),
**stumbling and bewildered** (倥侗颛蒙),
with **unopened insight** (聪明不开),
are called **foolish** (愚).
The **nature of the foolish** (愚人之性),
does not **broadly embrace things** (博物),
does not **know the Dao/Way** (知道),
does not **follow instruction** (不率教).
They say, *"What are heaven and earth?* (天地何物也？)
*What are their patterns and principles?* (文理何道也？)
Thus, they **see the sage as foolish** (见之为圣),
yet **know not why** (则罔知于何故)."

「I regard those who grasp the patterns and principles of time and things as wise—
for this is the wisdom of knowing others.
Moreover, wisdom is intelligence.
Once one knows others, one can know oneself.
When one knows oneself, one may broadly embrace things and elucidate the Dao/Way,
determine what is true and false—
this is the application of intelligence.

All stratagems and schemes lie within it;
whether one seeks wealth and honor or longevity, one attains them.
Thus, the patterns and principles of time and things are all within my grasp,
under my control—
what mastery of the Dao/Way!

To seize their patterns and principles as wisdom,
this is the fullness of virtue and power.
The *Yellow Emperor’s Yīn Fú* expounds upon this—
this is what the *Yellow Emperor* recorded.

Yet the *Yīn Fú* is concise in words yet profound in meaning,
its significance deep and its principles abyssal.
Following its intent and elucidating its teachings,
I allow later scholars to observe its words,
and thus its essence may be comprehended beyond half.

The wise regard the foolish as ignorant,
I regard the unwise as not truly sage.
Others await their virtue to be manifest,
I await not their sainthood.

The scholar **with the Dao yet concealing his traces** (有道而晦迹),
is said to embody the great wisdom of the foolish appearing wise.
Thus, he harmonizes with the interplay of heaven and humanity,
ensuring no discord arises.

This is the practice of the **Uncarved Block** (混沌氏),
**nurturing within himself the heart of a sage or wise man** (内蕴贤哲之心),
while outwardly indulging in the paths of the ignorant and vulgar to **evade the world** (遁世),
becoming a **useless tree** (不材之木),
and living out his natural lifespan—
this is the vision of the wise.

I do not indulge in foolishness,
for this is the *Yellow Emperor’s* words in jest.
Such people fear dying without renown,
so the **Great Alchemist** (大冶) forged his works,
descended among the common folk to bestow his spirit,
making them **sage or wise** (为贤为哲),
and showering benefits upon the world.

Now, if one abandons the world yet does not seek office,
is this not truly noble?

As *Lǎo Zǐ* said:
*"When one’s deeds are accomplished, one’s name is secure, and one withdraws—
this is the Dao/Way of heaven."*

The sage awaits the **heaven-born sage** (天生圣人),
to inherit the worthy and assist them.
As in the case of **King Gāozōng** (高宗) dreaming of the **Divine Speaker** (说),
was it **King Gāozōng** himself?
Or was it the **Divine Speaker**?
It was heaven that made it so! (自天使其然哉)»

「Thus, I do not seek the **heaven-born sage**—
it is because I embody the **Dao/Way of Nature**,
letting my desires harmonize with heaven’s **numbers/principles**,
so I never advance rashly, nor act out of time.
Thus, the **sage or wise** (贤) does not scorn the **foolish** (愚),
and the **sage** (圣) does not await the **worthy** (物我也).

This is grasping heaven’s **Dao/Way**,
so that **yin and yang, ghosts and spirits** (阴阳鬼神) cannot comprehend it.
Plunge into water, enter fire—
one will bring about one’s own destruction.
**Yin within yang** is called **fire** (离),
**yang within yin** is called **water** (坎).
Thus, **fire** is **li** (离),
**water** is **kan** (坎).

Now, the **Dark Female Gate** (玄牝之门),
this is called the **root of heaven and earth** (天地根),
also the **principle of human relations** (人伦之纪),
and the **order of male and female** (男女之序).
Desire cannot be eradicated—
it lies in moderation.
Thus, the analogy of **water and fire** (水火之喻)
is the **union of lead and mercury** (铅汞之合).
The **pairing of tiger and dragon** (虎龙之媾),
if their use is slightly excessive,
nearly risks losing my **precious essence** (吾宝).
The **Dao/Way of Nature** is tranquil,
so heaven and earth, all things, are born.
I act without contrivance,
yet the people transform themselves.
I love stillness,
yet the people align themselves.
This is the **Dao/Way of Nature** (向然之道).

Heaven and earth—
the **parents of all things** (万物之父母).
They do not **use life to sustain life** (以生为生),
how much more so for all things?
All things—
the **collective name of those that aid the Dao/Way** (辅道之总名).
The **Dao/Way’s essence** (道体) is the **state of Nature** (自然之情状),
so all things are born from it.
The **Dao/Way of heaven and earth** is **pervasive** (浸),
so **yin and yang** prevail.
Heaven bestows, earth nurtures—
their benefits are boundless.
The **Dao/Way of heaven** is **stillness** (静),
the **Dao/Way of earth** is **action** (动).
When **action and stillness** lose their **norms** (常),
**yin and yang** disrupt their **order** (序).
Now, even heaven and earth—
the most **great and vast** (至大)—
cannot **overflow** (盈溢),
how much more so for humans?
**Yin and yang** interact, their **transformation and change** (变化) follow **order** (顺).
The **two qi** (二炁) of heaven and earth are **yin and yang** (阴阳),
propagating through all things,
so their **changes and transformations** (变化)
are the **cyclical flow of yin and yang** (阴阳之循环).

Now, the **daily shifts** (旦暮之徙),
the **advance of hard and soft** (刚柔之行),
the **exchange of death and life** (死生代谢),
the **alternation of cold and heat** (寒暑迭迁),
the **constant motion of all things** (凡物流动),
are the **ordinary state of humans** (人之常情).
No single thing ever **transgresses yin and yang’s degrees and numbers** (出乎阴阳之度数).
Yet, the **six extremes** (六极) are obscure and profound,
all shaped by its **molding** (陶铸).

Therefore, the **sage** knows
that the **Dao/Way of Nature** (自然之道) cannot be **defied** (违).
He **conforms to it** (因以制之).
The **Dao/Way of Nature** does not **align with ordinary things** (与群物偶),
so the **sage** knows it cannot be **defied**—
it is because of its **constant principles** (常数).

Thus, humans **follow earth** (法地),
earth **follows heaven** (法天),
heaven **follows the Dao/Way** (法道),
and the **Dao/Way follows Nature** (法自然).
Who can **transgress the Dao/Way of Nature**?

The **Dao/Way’s ultimate stillness** (至静之道),
even **calendrical measurements** (律历) cannot **grasp** (契).
The **Dao/Way’s ultimate stillness**,
even **calendrical measurements** cannot **grasp**—
this is its **degrees and principles** (度数).
Humans are within the **Five Phases’ techniques** (五行术),
not **forging their mechanisms** (造其机).
How can one **transcend the mundane and attain sainthood** (超凡入圣)?

If one **reaches the ultimate Dao/Way** (至道),
how can **calendrical measurements** (律历) **fathom it** (测)?

The **Dao/Way of Nature**—
**emptiness within, substance within** (虚心实腹)—
only then can one speak of the **Dao/Way’s borders and limits** (道之涯约).
If **mechanical contrivances** (机械) are even slightly present in one’s **chest** (胸中),
how distant one is from the **Dao/Way**!

Here is the **strange instrument** (奇器),
the **source of all phenomena** (生万象).
The **strange instrument**—
this is the **substance that receives life** (受生之质).
The **Dao/Way** gives it **appearance** (貌),
heaven gives it **form** (形).
Thus, from the beginning, it has **innate spirit and clarity** (灵明),
and all phenomena are **complete within one body** (一身备矣).

The **Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems/Earthly Branches** (八卦甲子),
**divine mechanisms, hidden by spirits** (神机鬼藏).
The **techniques of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming** (阴阳相胜之术)
are **clearly manifest** (昭昭然) beyond the **trigrams** (象).

The **Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems/Earthly Branches**—
the **divine mechanisms, the spirits’ concealments** (神之机，鬼之藏).
Their **uses and applications** (机藏之用)
are only **mastered by ghosts and spirits** (唯鬼神而能之).
Thus, the **Dao/Way’s role in all transformations** (道之为万化),
no single thing is **unaccounted for** (无一物而不备),
no single person is **unfulfilled** (无一人而不全).

The **Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems/Earthly Branches**—
the **mechanisms and strategies of heaven and earth** (天地之机权),
the **mysteries of divine and ghostly operations** (神鬼之妙用),
so **viewing them has no end** (望之无际),
**applying them has no center** (处之无中),
**dwelling within them has no fixed place** (居不有方),
**emerging from them has no defined body** (出而无体).
This is the **exhaustive principle of the *Yīnfú* [《阴符》]** (尽理矣).

Those who **repeatedly speak of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming** (阴阳相胜之卫),
these are the **machinations that rob life** (贼命之机).
Later generations’ **clanking and clattering** (籛铿),
what **Yáng Chéngshì** (容成氏) obtained—
this is it.

**Clearly manifest** (昭昭) is **bright clarity** (明明).
**Beyond the trigrams** (进乎象)—
this is **great excess** (大过).
Within the **trigrams**, the **ninth at the fifth position** (卦中九五),
the **meaning of citrus and willow bearing fruit** (桔杨生华之义).
If one **understands the trigrams’ subtle changes** (契会卦炁抽添之象),
**discerns the faintest fluctuations** (消息之微),
**recognizes the methods of the Cauldron** (鼎器之法),
and **preserves essence, circulates qi** (保精运炁),
then one can **make yin and yang mutually overcome**.

As *Lǎo Zǐ* said:
*"The ancients who were skilled in the Dao/Way of the **gentleman** (士),
were **subtle, mysterious, and profound** (微妙玄通),
deep and **unfathomable** (深不可识).
This is the **essence of the Dao/Way** (要道)."

Then, **advance and retreat** (进退) are **governed by the lines** (用其爻),
**action and stillness** are **harmonized with the trigrams** (动静合其卦).
Thus, **li** (离) **gains yang** to **manifest form** (得阳以兆形),
**kan** (坎) **gains yin** to **complete its body** (得阴以成体).
This is called:
**"One yin, one yang—the Dao/Way"** (一阴一阳之谓道).

**Continuation** (继) is **virtue** (善),
**fulfillment** (成) is **nature** (性).
Thus, the **profound meaning of the *Yīnfú*** (《阴符》妙义),
without the **resources of a High True One or Upper Immortal** (高真上仙之资),
who can **attain this**?

Those who **contemplate it** (玩之者)
can **know it in the heart** (可以心知),
yet cannot **speak of it** (不可言告).
Thus, the **common folk use it daily without knowing** (百姓日用而不知).

The *Yellow Emperor’s* **Yīnfú Classic** (黄帝阴符经) is **complete**.」
