**Fascicle One: Preface and Memorial Illustrations**

**Memorial Presenting the Scripture**

Your humble subject, Wei Qi, respectfully states:
The celestial nature of life is bestowed by the One Origin at birth. The Dao shapes all forms, and the myriad beings share their essence with the Five Planets. With utmost reverence, we reflect upon Your Imperial Majesty—whose Dao aligns with the vast heavens, whose virtue merges with the divine. You perpetually revive the pristine customs of remote antiquity, far extending the grand legacy of bygone ages. The jade tablets and golden records of scripture are all reverently studied and practiced; those who dwell in mountain caves and wild places are universally elevated and promoted. Thus, moved by the fervor of the rustic and the boundless grace of Your Majesty’s clemency, I humbly present *The Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture*, praying for Your Sacred Person’s eternal longevity. May Your Yao-like benevolence broadly shelter all, Your sagely governance flourish in cultural splendor, Your Shun-like filial piety shine resplendently, and Your glorious era’s fortune be grandly manifest. As the jade candle harmonizes, spring burgeons and autumn sobers; as the celestial pivot turns, clouds nourish and stars gleam. Heaven and Earth assume their rightful places, the myriad beings are nurtured; transformation reaches its utmost bounds. Sun and moon illuminate, the four seasons proceed—sincerity thus aids both the hidden and the manifest.

Your subject, Qi, presumptuously affronts Heaven’s majesty; my humble heart cannot bear the awe of gazing upon Your Sacred Presence. With utmost trepidation and reverence, I bow twice and present this memorial for Your Majesty’s perusal.

Presented on a day in the ninth month of the third year of the Zhida era.
Your subject, Wei Qi, respectfully memorializes.

**Memorial to the Empress Dowager**

Your humble subject, Wei Qi, respectfully states:
The foundation of royal transformation is recorded in the ancient classics, from Tairen to Taisi. The origins of the *Guofeng* lie in the reverence for You Song and the esteem for the women of Jie and Xin. With utmost reverence, we reflect upon Her Imperial Highness the Empress Dowager—whose virtuous model is gentle and harmonious, whose graceful demeanor is pure and refined. Her aspirations, serene, align with the workings of Heaven; her virtue, upright, accords with Earth’s pattern. She stirs the awe of the hundred clans, guiding all to the realm of longevity. I, Qi, have long concealed my traces on Penglai, drifting like duckweed or tumbleweed in humble existence. Knowing well the Empress’s reception of Heaven’s blessings, I dare present *The Wenchang Scripture* in prayer and praise. May the moon’s radiance shimmer in splendor, emulating Heaven’s image to govern the Six Palaces; may the teachings of Yin flourish in clarity, embodying Earth’s origin to nurture the myriad beings. May the people, as children, universally bask in Her compassionate shade; may Hua and Yi alike be enveloped in Her singular grace.

Your subject, Qi, presumptuously affronts Her august kindness; my humble heart cannot bear the terror of hoping for Her favor. With utmost reverence and awe, I bow twice and respectfully submit this memorial.

Presented on a day in the ninth month of the third year of the Zhida era.
Your subject, Wei Qi, respectfully memorializes.

**Preface**

The Scripture is the guiding principle of the Dao. How could the Dao be contained in words? Yet the supreme sages, through words, composed texts, and through texts, expounded teachings—thereby ordering the world’s Way in ways beyond mortal comprehension. Thus, all scriptures possess ineffable subtleties. In recent times, scholars have parsed their phrases and annotated their chapters, often grasping the intent of the celestial and human in their explanations. Such is the case with the *Great Cavern Scripture*. Originating from the Primordial Beginning, its words plumb the profound and embrace the numinous, transcending truth through kalpas—truly what is called "wondrous."

Now, Master Wei of Zhongyang has ventured to compose new annotations for it, carving them for circulation. Having met me in the capital, he sought a preface. Upon examining his work, I found its depths unfathomable—truly beyond mortal comprehension. Yet I have heard that the purpose of expounding scripture lies in its myriad recitations, and those who embody the Dao savor it profoundly. In this, the Master has surely attained insight. If one grasps the meaning beyond the savor, then from myriad recitations one arrives at wordlessness, and the path to the Primordial Beginning’s revealed realm is without duality.

Composed in the fifth month of summer, the *renzi* year of the Huangqing era.
By special grace, the Perfected of Great Simplicity, Concentrated Spirit, Vast Dao, and Illuminated Virtue; the Thirty-Eighth Celestial Master of the Han Succession; Grand Master for Glorious Happiness; and Duke of Liu, Zhang Yucai.

The *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture* originated in Western Shu, and the Central Plains had not yet seen it. Master Wei of Zhongyang, arriving in the capital from Pengshan, presented me with a volume and requested a preface. Upon careful examination, I found it to expound teachings beyond the mundane. The Master has interwoven annotations from the Three Teachings’ sages, their purport profound and far-reaching. Without a thorough understanding of the Three Teachings’ texts, it would be difficult to grasp. Yet one phrase—*"the jade chamber where yin and yang merge as one"*—and its annotation on the union of yin and yang verge on the carnal. Could Master Wei have tailored this for the present age? Still, one must be wary of "explaining dreams to a fool."

Moreover, the Western Sage once said: *"From the Deer Park to the River of Crossing, not a single word was spoken in between."* Our Master Confucius also declared: *"What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed, and the myriad things are born."* The Old Sage likewise taught: *"Excessive speech leads to exhaustion; better to abide in the center."* Thus, language and writing are but expedients by which sages reveal the Dao when unavoidable. If one attains the Dao, what need remains for words or writing? What does the Master of Zhongyang make of this view?

Respectfully inscribed on the full moon of the *Qinghe* month, the fourth year of the Zhida era.

Before the tortoise and horse [emblems of the Han] appeared, the Five Scripts had already manifested in the *Lingbao* texts. The flourishing of the celestial Way and this culture is like nurturing primordial qi—vast and self-subsistent. The more it is muddied, the clearer it becomes; the more it is obscured, the brighter it shines. It knows no interruption, no existence or extinction. The fires of kalpas cannot burn it; the vicissitudes of ages cannot alter it. Lofty and abiding above, were it not for the unyielding integrity, purity, and essence of its nature, its mechanism would cease. Thus, the ceaseless operation of form and nature is governed by what may be called the Emperor.

The Old Immortal of Sevenfold Curves, through meritorious conduct and virtue, has illuminated the warp and weft of scripture with divine clarity. How vast is the Emperor’s power! Holding this register of scripture, he awakens all beings, for it is the pivot of creation, the source of nature and life. The Governor resides herein—from before the first form arose to the boundless reaches beyond the four directions. Vast and empty! The ten thousand differences share one root; a thousand kalpas follow one path. Viewed through the Dharma-eye, it is utterly unobstructed.

What I call the *Great Simplicity*, *Great Beginning*, *Great Origin*, *Great Primal*, and *Great Ultimate* is none other than the *Wenchang Great Cavern* transmitted by the Primordial Beginning. Master Wei of Zhongyang has plumbed its mysteries, parsing its phrases and explicating its characters. Grounded in the learning of the Dao, the principles of nature, the alchemical formulas, and the mechanisms of Chan, he has thoroughly revealed the heart-mind methods of sages across the ages, leaving no residue. Lofty and abiding above, it is overseen by the divine. Readers, take heed!

Respectfully inscribed on an early summer day, the *xinhai* year of the Zhida era.

**Preface to the Annotated *Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture***

I have heard that the jade of the Mystic Garden, the gold of Kunwu, the luminous pearl of Zhao, and the jade disk of Liancheng—whether dredged from Hepu, mined from Kunlun, or bearing names like "Bright Moon" or "Radiant Raiment"—were treasured by Bian He and cherished by the Marquis of Sui. Though the world may have heard of them, few have seen them, yet all revere and long to behold them. How much more so for the *Dark Pearl*, the *Grain of Millet*, the *Canghu Jiemo Pearl*—treasures prized by gods and humans? Such is the *Wenchang Great Cavern*.

It resides within all yet remains unseen and unvalued by its bearers, who discard and scorn it. Thus, the sages expounded it to awaken beings, employing metaphors drawn from dharmic forms—not as tangible traces, but as radiant qi transformed into sound, not as written words. The supreme Dao is wordless; the supreme truth is imageless. Since the division of the undifferentiated, the principles of the Three Powers have become manifest, and the body of primordial transformation has returned to unity. One knows not whether the Dao is me or I am the Dao. Yet after the Five Phases fell into disorder and qi’s movements shifted, the root of life became constrained by governance. Thus, the Three Treasures Lord once again revealed the original cause to gods and humans: *"The qi of your bodies is my qi; the spirit of your beings is my truth."* He desired that all people awaken to this, seeing that they might return to me and no longer be bound by qi’s movements, thereby attaining the natural effortlessly.

For this reason, the Primordial Beginning re-expounded the thirty-six chapters’ secrets, comprising 3,188 words, and entrusted them to the Jade Emperor Dao Lord. He composed a preface recounting their origins, totaling 908 words, and bestowed it upon the Great Mystery Dao Father. The two sages’ dharma-words together number 4,096.

Thus, though the Perfect Truth bears no form, the traces of the sages grew ever more manifest; though the True Lord spoke no words, the mysterious scriptures flourished in abundance. Embracing heaven and earth, shaping the myriad things with subtle art—how vast is this supreme treasure! Truly it is said: *"Only the Creative Beginning can bestow the finest blessings upon the world."*

Now, the thirty-six chapters correspond to the four nines of the Metal tally, embodying the Way of the Golden Elixir within oneself. The upper scroll contains ten chapters, the middle scroll ten, and the lower scroll sixteen—all three scrolls composed in five-character lines, totaling thirty-six chapters. Above these chapters stands the *"Great Cavern Sovereign of the Imperial Honored One,"* a single chapter in four-character lines, distinct in form and placed at the head of the entire scripture.

Each of the three scrolls is prefaced by an introductory sutra, and the lower scroll concludes with a closing sutra—all expounded by the Jade Emperor Dao Lord—thus revealing the full scope of the text from beginning to end. In the early Zhou dynasty, the Celestial Emperor commanded the Three Perfected Ones to transmit it to Master Zhang Tongzhen of the Grand Assembly. This is that very scripture. By reckoning the time, more than twenty-five hundred years have passed since then.

There exists a version by Wei Yuanjun of Maoshan, titled *The Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Jade Scripture*, said to have been transmitted by the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy. Compared to this text, it lacks two chapters and contains eighty additional characters. Another version, from the time of Emperor Ming of the Liu Song, by Lu Xiujing, appends the *"First of the Emperor,"* *"Feminine One,"* and *"Masculine One"* scriptures—some in three-character lines, others in four, with irregular meter—to the respective chapters, resulting in a greater number of verses, though the main text remains the same.

Examining the records, it is written: During the Tang dynasty, the Perfected Wang Baohe of Zizhou, by imperial command, collated *The Thirty-Nine Chapters Great Cavern Scripture* and transmitted it to his successor. In the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song, Master Zhu Ziying of the Observing Mystery wrote a commentary, and in the first year of the Zhenghe era, Zhang Shangying presented a memorial to the throne—both largely in accord with this text. Originally comprising one hundred and twenty scrolls, the Jade Emperor Dao Lord and Niu Ziming, the Great Mystery Dao Father, distilled its essentials, divided its chapters and verses, and arranged the thirty-six chapters into three scrolls for ease of cultivation.

Above, it stabilizes the thirty-six heavens; below, it governs the thirty-six earths; and within, it connects the qi of the thirty-six palaces of the human body. Is this not what is meant by *"thirty-six above in heaven, thirty-six below on earth, boundless the Great Mystery—how wondrous the* Great Cavern Scripture!"* The scripture records the hidden names and taboo titles of celestial perfected beings, linking them to the qi and spirits within the human body. Thus, it stands above the *"Salvation of Humanity,"* *"Birth of the Divine,"* and *"Yellow Court"* scriptures. For this reason, inner and outer illuminate each other, above and below intertwine—all drawn from the microcosm of the human body as a small heaven and earth.

If one can nurture their own spirit and qi, chanting the precious chapters, then the celestial perfected will descend and merge with the qi and spirits within one’s body. This is called *"returning wind and blending harmoniously,"* where form and spirit attain perfection, uniting with the Dao in truth. Thus, the Way of longevity is achieved, enabling one to grasp heaven and earth, seize yin and yang, command wind and thunder, and dispatch gods and ghosts. One may recline in the carriage of flowing clouds, gazing upon the Terrace of Literary Florescence.

Yet people merely know that reciting the scripture leads to death, and not reciting it also leads to death—how can there be a principle of longevity? They fail to realize that reciting the scripture allows one to shed the illusory body and attain the true form, called *"liberation from the corpse."* Those who do not recite it perish along with their illusory body and true form alike. The sharpest of roots understand without being told, while the foolish and unworthy, though admonished repeatedly, remain utterly oblivious. Moreover, the chapters, verses, and meanings are profound and obscure—who but a heavenly being reborn could comprehend them?

In my youth, I was instructed in proper conduct and studied the various masters and hundred schools without exception. In the *yisi-mao* year of the Zhiyuan era, at the age of twenty, I received and recited this scripture. Now, thirty years have passed, and I have only lamented the corruption of the text—nine out of ten copies diverge, leaving no standard to follow. I often recalled that in my childhood, I had read the Three Treasuries and remembered a character or two, yet dared not presume to correct the errors myself. Moreover, after the great refining furnace of the world’s teachings, the true scriptures have all but vanished.

In recent years, while holding minor office in the southwest, I urged others to study this text, visiting every household. Many took to reading it, but I, having transmitted errors in turn, found little peace in my heart. Recently, wandering by rivers and lakes, I sat in quietude at an inn and gained sudden insight. I then reviewed my former annotations, comparing them with the Three Teachings’ scriptures I had once memorized, and where their meanings aligned, I provided explanations verse by verse. Following the *Great Change*’s principles of the Limitless, the Yellow River and Luo River diagrams, the pre- and post-heaven trigrams, the firing times of the Golden Elixir, and the celestial qi of the Imperial Honored One, I arranged thirteen illustrations to precede the scripture, so that one might grasp its meaning at a glance.

Yet my humble insights are shallow and crude, and I fear incurring the censure of heaven and the ridicule of the learned. Only after respectfully presenting this to the Investigating Commissioner of the Perfected Lord of Life and receiving his unseen approval did I dare share it with like-minded seekers. This is not to glorify the great scripture but merely to illuminate it for those of modest capacity. Written in the *jiyou* year of the Zhida era, in the eastern mountains of Shu, by Zhongyangzi Wei Qi of Penglai Mountain, who bows in reverence and respectfully presents this preface.

The *Illustration of the Ultimateless*
Zhou Dunyi created the *Taiji* to encompass the *Book of Changes*; I expound the Ultimateless to summarize the *Great Cavern*. For the *Taiji* already embodies the forms and qi, while the Ultimateless is without sound, without scent, without image, without name—only principle remains.

Zhou Dunyi also said: "The Ultimateless and yet the Supreme Ultimate." When the Ultimateless moves, it becomes yang and generates primordial qi, which pertains to water—thus called *Taiyi* (Great Simplicity), giving rise to primordial light. When it stills, it becomes yin and generates original qi, which pertains to fire—thus called *Yuanming* (Original Destiny), giving rise to *Taichu* (Great Beginning). When stillness reaches its extreme and reverts to movement, it becomes yang and generates inceptional qi, which pertains to wood—thus called *Taishi* (Great Inception). When the three qi cycle, the primordial, original, and inceptional qi are complete, and qi, form, and substance are fully possessed yet never separate—this is called *Taisu* (Great Simplicity). When it stills, it becomes yin and pertains to metal—thus called *Taisu*. The initial three qi of the Brahma-conduct form the root of heaven and earth, and all things attain their proper positions—this is called *Taiji* (Supreme Ultimate). When it moves, it becomes yang and pertains to earth, governing the Four Images—thus called *Taiji Wuling Chong* (Supreme Ultimate of Five Spirits in Harmony). Movement and stillness alternate as each other’s root; therefore, the Five Ultimates and Five Phases are called the Five Elders. The *Five Talismans Jade Scripture* states they were born before the Original Beginning.

The Heavenly King further unfolded the primordial qi of *Taiyi*, condensing it into a single ○ precious pearl—this is the Five Phases as one yin-yang, yin-yang as one *Taiji*, and the *Taiji* as fundamentally the Ultimateless. Thus it is said: "The Ultimateless governs the true script of the Wenchang Great Cavern."

I take this ○ precious light and condense it into the myriad qi, which transform and give birth to the various heavens. Again, I distribute its light into hundreds, thousands, and myriads of billions, forming the *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture*—the Jade Scripture that establishes heaven and earth and enlightens the divine spirits. It is also said: "The Five Qi knit the ten directions; the myriad qi generate the myriad spirits"—this is the Five Phases unfolding in sequence, with the four seasons proceeding accordingly. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: "The Five Scripts open the expanse, universally planting divine spirits. Without script, there is no light—equal to the myriad spirits and myriad qi of immortals." This is the true essence of the Ultimateless, the essence of the Two and Five, where the two qi interact and transform to generate the myriad things. Thus, Wenchang is the ancestor of heaven and earth, the mother of the myriad things. Therefore, every person possesses a Wenchang, and every thing possesses a *Taiji*.

If one can diligently cultivate and refine the Way of the Wenchang Great Cavern, one will ultimately return to the midst of the Ultimateless—emptiness and spontaneity. Human life naturally arises from nothingness, and in old age, returns to nothingness. By examining the *Illustration of the Ultimateless*, one knows that the two qi and Five Phases originate from the two qi—yin and yang—and the Five Phases are water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. Principle gives rise to qi, and qi gives rise to script. Script refers to the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches.

Yang moves and generates *renzi* (Yang Water), the first number; yin stills and generates *dingsi* (Yin Fire), the second number; it moves again and generates *jia-yin* (Yang Wood), the third number; it stills again and generates *xinyou* (Yin Metal), the fourth number; it moves and generates *wuchen-xu* (Yang Earth), the fifth number; it stills and forms *guihai* (Yin Water), the sixth number; it moves and forms *bingwu* (Yang Fire), the seventh number; it stills and forms *yimao* (Yin Wood), the eighth number; it moves and forms *gengshen* (Yang Metal), the ninth number; it stills and forms *chou-wei* (Yin Earth), the tenth number.

Though called Heavenly Stems, they also possess yin and yang: *jia, bing, geng, ren, wu* are yang stems, belonging to yang and necessarily moving to form script; *yi, ding, xin, gui, ji* belong to yin and necessarily still to form script. The Earthly Branches also possess yin and yang: *zi, wu, yin, shen, chen, xu* are yang branches; *si, hai, mao, you, chou, wei* are yin branches.

When the Five Scripts are complete, their names are the Five Ultimates. Yet the scripture further speaks of Five Ultimates, making Ten Ultimates—would this not invite the scorn of the discerning? They do not know that each of the Five Phases possesses two qi, which interact to generate the Five Phases. Yang generates as one Ultimate, yin completes as one Ultimate, mutually engendering and transforming to form the script of heaven and earth. The scripture states: "The true script commences with illumination; a spark ignites the true script. The Ten Virtues proclaim the true script; the horizontal script welcomes the Emperor’s sons. The Ten Transcendents knit the human script"—all unfold through the Five Scripts. Thus, heaven, earth, and the myriad things all grow and flourish by means of them.

Some may ask: "The Yellow Emperor commanded Da Nao to explore the essence of the Five Phases and create the *Jiazi* cycle—how could it exist before heaven and earth?" They do not know that the *Jiazi* was born before heaven and earth; this is merely its manifestation through humanity. The Heavenly Sovereign’s *Jiazi* cycle of Ten Stems and Twelve Branches originally began with *Sheti* above *yin*; this is recorded in the *Erya*. Later, Fuxi began from *jia*, saying: "The east’s *jia* is the flourishing virtue of wood, where the myriad things begin to grow"—thus starting the Ten Stems with *jia*. The two qi of yin and yang transform to generate the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. In heaven, they are the celestial patterns; on earth, they are the terrestrial principles. By gazing upward and examining below, exploring the profound and seeking the hidden, and investigating the sources and flows, the sixty *Jiazi* cycles correspond to the sixty stellar positions in the heavens. The qi of the Five Phases transform into the Eight Trigrams, which settle the eight directions. Now, the sixty *Jiazi* and sixty-four hexagrams are distributed throughout the *Cavern Chapters*, all harmonizing with the wondrous Dao.

The qi of the Nine August Upper Perfected is *renzi*, generating the Heavenly One’s water—this is *Taiyi* (Great Simplicity). The pure qi of the Supreme Center’s Six Qi is *guihai*, forming the Earthly Six’s water—this is *Taizhong* (Supreme Center). The qi of the Heavenly August Upper Perfected is *dingsi*, generating the Earthly Two’s fire—this is *Taichu* (Great Beginning). The Yellow Radiance qi of the Morning Center is *bingwu*, forming the Heavenly Seven’s fire—this is *Taihe* (Great Harmony). The qi of the Supreme One’s Upper Prime is *jia-yin*, generating the Heavenly Three’s wood—this is *Taishi* (Great Inception).

The qi of the Golden Watchtower’s Upper Radiance is *yi-mao*, forming the Earthly Eight’s wood—this is *Taiqing* (Great Purity). The Primordial Simplicity’s initial ascetic practice is *xin-you*, generating the Earthly Four’s metal—this is *Taisu* (Primordial Simplicity). The Supreme Perfected’s Ninefold Light Wheel is *geng-shen*, forming the Heavenly Nine’s metal—this is *Taizhen* (Supreme Perfection). The Fivefold Numinous Surge of the Great Ultimate is *wu-chen-xu*, generating the Heavenly Five’s earth—this is *Taiji* (Great Ultimate). The Tenfold Brilliance of the Primordial Mystery is *ji-chou-wei*, forming the Earthly Ten’s earth—this is *Taixuan* (Primordial Mystery).

The classics are the embodiment of numbers; numbers are the function of the classics. Those who cultivate the Way of Wenchang cannot be ignorant of numbers. For heaven and earth operate through numbers, and the myriad things come into being through numbers. Numbers are precisely the movement and stillness of yin and yang within the Great Ultimate.

The *Book of Changes* states: "The numbers of heaven are five; the numbers of earth are five. The five positions interact and each has its correspondence. The numbers of heaven total twenty-five; the numbers of earth total thirty. Together, the numbers of heaven and earth total fifty-five." The *Elixir Classic* says: "East three and south two together make five; north one and west four share the same. *Wu-si* returns to follow the generative number of wood. When the three families meet, they form the infant." This is what is meant by Wenchang.

The Dao is the classic and the *Book of Changes*; the *Book of Changes* is numbers and images. The classic states: "With the qi of the Mysterious One, the sound of the Great Mystery, and the true Way of the August One," and also: "From the wondrous One of the Dao, the root of life-bestowing goodness is conceived. The Mysterious divides the origin, the Beginning transmits the true, and the myriad heavens are transformed and born." Tracing their origins, all arise from the number one.

For when the Mysterious qi moves, it first generates water, then earth and wood; when still, it generates metal and fire. From one to five, the Five Phases are sequentially arrayed. Then six is paired with one to form water; seven with two to form fire; eight with three to form wood; nine with four to form metal; and ten with five to form earth. Thus transformations are accomplished, and the spirits and gods are set in motion.

Before the Great Ultimate divided, these numbers were already latent within the Ultimate of Non-being. Therefore, the generation and completion of heaven, earth, and humanity depend on numbers, and their decay and ruin also depend on numbers—yet the common people use them daily without awareness. When the sage Fuxi emerged, moved by the dragon-horse bearing the River Chart, he followed its patterns to draw the eight trigrams.

Those who understand these numbers find the Way of nature and life within them, and thus Wenchang is fully encompassed. Therefore, the lower scroll speaks of the Five Greatnesses, Five Phases, Five Elders, and Five Talismans—all that generates heaven, establishes earth, and nurtures humanity—none of which do not originate from the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams. For the palaces and trigrams arise from the two qi and the Five Phases, and these two and five in turn emerge from the Great Ultimate and the Ultimate of Non-being.

Fuxi was a great sage who meditated deeply on the supreme Way, his spirit moving heaven. Tracing the origins of heaven and earth and following the transformations of Pangu, he took his own body’s hair and skin as the images of the trigrams. When Jizi composed the *Hongfan*, the nine and five blessings were: first, longevity; second, wealth; third, health and peace; fourth, the love of virtue; fifth, a natural end to life. These five blessings are what all people in the world desire, yet they do not know the Way by which to cultivate and advance toward them. This begins with the Luo Diagram. The Nine Palaces of the Luo Diagram are the "use of nine" in the *Book of Changes* and the "demonstration of nine" in *Wenchang*. Those who apply their minds to this will find the *Book of Changes*’ pure *Qian* and *Wenchang*’s pure yang converging without prior agreement. Thus it is said: "The noble person works unceasingly all day, striving to improve without rest," and also: "Continuous as if existing"—this is what is meant by seeking blessings without deviation.

The Luo Diagram is: wearing nine on the head and treading one underfoot, three on the left and seven on the right, two and four as the shoulders, six and eight as the feet. By regulating the qi’s flow in both forward and reverse, traversing the Nine Palaces, the sums of the vertical and horizontal lines are all fifteen. Interwoven with the River Chart, they form the Way of the Three Powers—truly the numbers that warp heaven and weft earth.

After the undifferentiated chaos divided, the myriad things relied on it to come into being. When the Luo tortoise emerged bearing its patterns in the time of Great Yu, the images and numbers first became efficacious. Yu used them to regulate the waters and arrange the Nine Categories. Jizi followed them to compose the *Hongfan*, King Wen followed them to rearrange the positions of the trigrams—these were the numbers of the Great Ultimate. Thus *Wenchang* states: "Demonstrating the methods of the nine governances, transmitting the talismans of the nine lights"—all employing nine, for nine is the number of pure yang. Therefore, the classic has thirty-six chapters, just as *Qian*’s "use of nine" is no different. This is the root of nature and life within the Three Powers, the Way of simplicity spoken of in the *Taiyi*—yet people are unaware of it, and some drift into the schools of yin-yang and geomancy.

Those who seek the five blessings of the *Hongfan* must thoroughly investigate the nine numbers of *Wenchang* before they can succeed. Above are the Nine Heavens, and the human head also has nine palaces to correspond to them. The earth has nine provinces, and the human body has nine orifices to correspond to them. The Dipper has nine origins, and the human heart has nine apertures to correspond to them. Water has nine rivers, and the human intestines have nine curves to correspond to them.

Nine is the number of yang, and humanity cannot live without yang. Yu grieved over Gun’s execution and meditated in profound resonance, desiring to restore the great work. Thus heaven bestowed upon him the governance of the waters, all in accord with the substance and function of heaven and earth’s great transformations.

The River Chart emerged thousands of years before the Luo Diagram, which is why Fuxi was able to draw the Former Heaven Eight Trigrams—these were the fifty-five numbers contained within the Great Ultimate. In drawing the trigrams, there seemed to be an order, yet many predecessors took the nine numbers of the Luo Diagram to be the River Chart. Liu Mu followed this transmission, and it has persisted to this day. Here, through exploration within *Wenchang*, it is found that the River Chart corresponds to ten, while the Luo Diagram corresponds to nine. Thus their sequence is set forth: within the Ultimate of Non-being, this structure was already present, though its secrets remained hidden. Only when the dragon-horse bore the chart in Fuxi’s time did it emerge, and he drew the eight trigrams accordingly. Taking the odd, light, and pure numbers one, five, and seven as yang, he placed them above to form *Qian* heaven. Taking the even, heavy, and turbid numbers two, six, and ten as yin, he placed them below to form *Kun* earth. This is called "the positions of heaven and earth are fixed"—it is the Great Ultimate generating the Two Modes.

Taking the five numbers and pairing them with one, two, three, and four to form Old Yin, Old Yang, Young Yin, and Young Yang—this is the Two Modes generating the Four Images. By interweaving the numbers six, seven, eight, nine, and ten, the eight trigrams are formed: one *Qian*, two *Dui*, three *Li*, four *Zhen*, five *Xun*, six *Kan*, seven *Gen*, and eight *Kun*. Their symbolic correspondences are taken in opposition: thunder and wind press upon each other, mountains and marshes exchange qi, water and fire do not repel—whether arranged vertically or horizontally, the total is nine. This is called the Four Images generating the eight trigrams.

Thus, the roundness of a person’s head resembles *Qian* heaven, the squareness of the feet resembles *Kun* earth, the body resembles *Gen* mountain, the bodily fluids resemble *Dui* marsh, the voice resembles *Zhen* thunder, the breath resembles *Xun* wind, the blood and nourishment resemble *Kan* water, and the defensive qi resembles *Li* fire—are not the eight trigrams all present within us?

Therefore, in aligning the *Yi* with the principles of the *Cantong Qi*, the teachings of *Wenchang* and the *Dadong* are especially profound and obscure. Some find them difficult to comprehend and are unwilling to recite them. Thus, I have now drawn from the more accessible meanings in various scriptures to synthesize them, so that devout men and women, regardless of wisdom or folly, may all attain understanding.

Before heaven and earth were separated, their form was like a hen’s egg. Within it was Hundun, who took the clear as heaven and the turbid as earth. Hundun grew one *zhang* each day, and heaven and earth opened by one *zhang* each day. His eyes became the sun and moon, his body the mountains, his hair the grasses and trees, and his bodily fluids the waters—this was Pangu.

The Luo Diagram emerged thousands of years after the River Chart. Yu the Great obtained it to regulate the waters—this too is the Five Agents within the Great Ultimate.

Is the purpose of the charts and diagrams merely to draw trigrams and regulate waters? No—it is truly the substance and function of nature and destiny. Without the pre- and post-heavenly charts, their essence could not be revealed, and without the pre- and post-heavenly *Yi* and *Wenchang*, their function could not be manifested. Thus, essence and function are mutually inclusive, nature and destiny illuminate each other—neither can be lacking. I respectfully record both to share with like-minded seekers.

The scripture states: "The Eight Sovereigns govern the Nine Heavens"—these are the eight trigrams and the nine palaces. The eight numbers and nine chapters form an outer and inner correspondence, so the River Chart and Luo Diagram serve as warp and weft. They existed already in the pre-heavenly and pre-earthly state. King Wen later took the River and Luo, carefully examined them, and rearranged the eight trigrams. Thus, *Qian* and *Kun*, as Old Yang and Old Yin, already contained the three sons and three daughters, and so they were retired to the positions of non-use. Therefore, in the *Yi*, *Qian* is placed in the northwest, *Kun* is moved to the southwest, *Kan* and *Li* (yin and yang) properly intersect at the central palace, occupying the due north and south positions. *Zhen*, as the initial intersection of yang, is placed in the east; *Dui*, as the beginning of yin’s intersection, is established in the due west. *Gen* and *Xun*, being mixed yin and yang without mutual resonance, are positioned in the outlying corners.

The post-heavenly eight trigrams circulate among the nine palaces, with five residing at the center and lodging its position in two—this is called "two and five share the same function." The *Yi* states: "The Lord emerges from *Zhen*, aligns with *Xun*, appears in *Li*, labors in *Kun*, delights in speech in *Dui*, battles in *Qian*, toils in *Kan*, and completes speech in *Gen.*" Thus the four seasons proceed, the myriad things are born, and the *Yi* operates throughout heaven and earth.

How could *Wenchang* and the *Yi* be unrelated? For the human body is a small heaven and earth, and *Wenchang* weaves its warp and weft within it. If one can preserve wholeness and return to this, one does not betray the transformative nurturing of the sages, and this scripture is not mere empty text.

The Nine Radiance Talisman is the congealed script of the Primordial Chaos Red Writ and the Nine Yang Brahman qi. First, the initial green radiance begins the Green Heaven, condensing the Great Empyrean Palace in the northeast. Next, the Great Green radiance opens the Great Green Heaven, condensing the Azure Empyrean Palace in the east. Then, the initial cinnabar radiance begins the Cinnabar Heaven, condensing the Bluegreen Empyrean Palace in the southeast. Next, the Great Cinnabar radiance opens the Great Cinnabar Heaven, condensing the Crimson Empyrean Palace in the south. Then, the initial white radiance begins the White Heaven, condensing the Scenic Empyrean Palace in the southwest. Next, the Great White radiance opens the Great White Heaven, condensing the Jade Empyrean Palace in the west. Then, the initial black radiance begins the Black Heaven, condensing the Jadeite Empyrean Palace in the northwest. Next, the Great Black radiance opens the Great Black Heaven, condensing the Purple Empyrean Palace in the north. Finally, the Great Brahman radiance opens the Great Brahman Heaven, condensing the Divine Empyrean Palace at the center.

The Nine Governances: one emperor governs the affairs of all heavens, hence it is called the method of demonstrating the Nine Governances. The Nine Radiance Talisman is transmitted to assemble the spirits. When a person is first born, they receive the qi of the Nine Heavens and thus possess form and spirit. The cultivator completes nine months of practice, and in the tenth month, the sacred embryo is formed—only then can it be nurtured. The perfected ones condense the nine qi into script, calling it the Nine Radiance Talisman, to deliver beings in heaven and earth. This is fully recorded in the registers of the methods.

Here, the Divine Empyrean generates the spirits of the Nine Heavens: above, it governs the thirty-six stellar luminaries of the heavens; below, it governs the thirty-six earthly sovereigns of the fortresses; and in the middle, it governs the thirty-six palaces within the human body. These thirty-six palaces are all infused by the true qi distributed from the upper heavens, irrigating the chambers—only then is a person formed. The *Lesser Scripture of Salvation from Suffering* states: "Return the qi of the upper heavens to control the souls of the Nine Heavens."

The thirty-six heavens and thirty-six earths are detailed in their respective chapters. Now, the thirty-six palaces of the human body are divided into the upper, middle, and lower sections for distribution. When reciting this scripture, one must calm the mind, sit in silence, and visualize the thirty-six palaces within one’s own heart shining brilliantly. Within each palace resides a perfected one, emitting five-colored radiance—above connecting to the thirty-six heavens, below connecting to the thirty-six earths—so that spirit and qi congeal and communicate between above and below. This is what is meant by "the method of the Nine Governances to assemble the emperor, the Nine Radiance Talisman to gather the spirits."

When the radiance and qi have congealed and stabilized, then regulate the voice and rectify the qi, chanting the cavernous chapters. Nine recitations constitute one cycle. After each recitation, dedicate the merit to the perfected ones above, the ghosts and spirits of the middle and lower realms, and the consciousness of one’s own ancestors—bestowing blessings upon each as desired. Sit briefly to allow the spirit and qi to disperse slightly, then rise from the seat unhurriedly. Do not act abruptly, lest the divine radiance be disturbed and the ghosts and spirits rebuke. During scripture recitation, one must not speak. The following is now revealed:

The Golden Elixir is the single point of true yang within the human body, co-emergent with Heaven and Earth, co-luminous with the sun and moon. When it scatters, it becomes a person; when it gathers, it forms the Elixir. The scripture calls it the "Mother of the Elixir," the perfection of true yang.

True yang is lead, born in Kun, which is Earth—termed the "Mysterious Fire of the Dark King." The seed of mercury resides in Qian, which is Heaven, thus enabling the seizure of Heaven and Earth as the crucible and cauldron. It is called "the King of the Dipper in the sun’s embrace, the Feathered One in the moon’s dawn," hence the ability to gather the sun and moon as medicinal substances. It is termed "the dark transformation of Kan’s fusion, the union of yin and yang in the Jade Chamber," where the Yellow Dame serves as the matchmaker, uniting Wood Lord and Metal Mother in harmonious resonance. It is called "the Purple Flower nurturing the embryo," signifying the completion of the sacred fetus in ten months. It is called "the Infant as the Crimson Child," when the yang spirit suddenly manifests in form. The "fusion of the Three and Five Palaces" refers to pursuing the two qi along the Yellow Path and uniting the three natures in the Primordial Palace. The "five qi binding the ten directions and clustering the five phases" denotes the convergence of the five agents. The "Supreme Ultimate governing the Four Perfected" signifies the harmonization of the four images. The "Yellow Court traversing the Northern Primordial" describes true yang ascending to the heart’s palace. The "nine cycles returning to seven" refers to the advancing and retreating, drawing and adding of the *Yi* hexagrams as the fire-timing of the celestial revolution. The "embodiment of the precious pearl illuminating the Mysterious Azure and the Barbarian Pearl" signifies the instantaneous completion of the Golden Elixir with a moment’s effort. The "nurturing and refining of the Five Sprouts Pearl" means that by ingesting this Golden Elixir, one attains the rank of Great Cavern Heaven’s Imperial Perfected.

The scripture’s discourse on the Golden Elixir is manifold; here, only its essentials are briefly outlined.

The "Center" is the center within the center—neither above nor below, neither edge nor side. The Buddhists say: "Neither thinking of good nor evil, in this very moment, one sees the original face." The Confucians call it "tranquil and unmoving," while the Daoists term it the "thought-moment." It cannot be sought through sound or scent, nor grasped through form or appearance. It is perpetually empty, numinous, and unwavering. If one threads through it, this aperture will not shine.

Formerly, when Xue Youqi annotated the *Lingbao Scripture*, he was visited by two immortals, the Twin Boys and Master Ban Bai. In their discourse on the Dao, they spoke of the wonders of the Five Perfected roaming the spirit, which refers precisely to this.

The Five Spirits reside in Heaven, in humans, and in things, all governing the affairs of generation and transformation. Without this spirit to preside over the ceaseless movement of life, the mechanism would cease. Thus, the *Scripture of Salvation* states: "Grasping talismans and holding registers, one preserves life and roots existence, moving in and out of the Flowery Chambers, within the eight obscurities and the subtlest realms, descending to guard the Mud Pill Palace and Crimson Palace of the human body." Therefore, scriptures such as the *Wenchang*, *Lingbao*, *Yellow Court*, and *Engendering the Spirit* all expound upon this.

The Five Spirits disperse into the myriad spirits, but when gathered, they revert to the single Infant. The names of the myriad spirits cannot be exhaustively recorded; here, only the essentials are briefly presented to facilitate contemplation. Through concentrated thought and profound visualization, they will naturally resonate and manifest within one’s own body. The following is now revealed:

The human body is formed by the congealing of the myriad qi, and life begins when the myriad spirits are complete. At birth, one is an infant, purely harmonious and serene, with the heavenly principle undifferentiated—this is the original body of the Great Cavern’s Imperial Perfected. If one cultivates the *Wenchang* scripture to return to the infant, it is called "the wondrous union of form and spirit."

Once the infant is formed, it transforms into the mysterious qi, termed "ascending into formlessness, merging with the Dao, and returning to the Ultimate Nonbeing." Only then does one realize that the root-source arises and concludes here.

The *Great Penetration Scripture* states: "True emptiness, without form, is utterly perfect and complete."

*Preface and Charts to the Jade Purity, Ultimate Nonbeing, All-True Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture, Fascicle One*

*(Note: "吏" is likely a scribal error for "史." The phrase "四数" should read "四数也." "炁清" should be "清炁." Two characters in the original text are illegible.)*

*Jade Purity, Ultimate Nonbeing, All-True Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture, Fascicle Two*
*Annotated by Zhongyangzi Wei Qi of Mount Penglai in Eastern Shu*

**Explication of the Scripture’s Title**

**Jade Purity (Yu Qing):** Within Jade Purity already exists the qi of Grand Simplicity (Tai Yi), Grand Beginning (Tai Chu), Grand Commencement (Tai Shi), and Grand Prime (Tai Su). Though form and essence are not yet distinct, there arises the qi of the Great Cavern (Da Dong), the Lofty and Primordial (Gao Shang), the Vast Nonbeing (Hun Dong Tai Wu), the Original Heavenly Treasure (Yuan Tian Bao), and the Jade Sovereign (Yu Huang), from which the Primordial Beginning (Yuan Shi) is born. At that time, it was named the Lofty and Vast Jade Purity Palace (Gao Shang Da You Yu Qing Guan). Thus, the Great Cavern is none other than the Supreme Ultimate (Tai Ji). This era was called the Dragon Han Upper Kalpa (*Long Han Shang Jie*), the time from which the *Wenchang Scripture* emerged.

**Ultimate Nonbeing (Wu Ji):** "Ultimate Nonbeing and yet the Supreme Ultimate—the Supreme Ultimate is fundamentally Ultimate Nonbeing." Prior to the Five Primes (Wu Tai), there was only the profound and formless, beyond all description; hence, it is called Ultimate Nonbeing.

**All-True (Zong Zhen):** This encompasses the names of the celestial perfected, earthly sages, human spirits, and the essences of the six wefts (*liu wei*). Where there is form, there must be qi; where there is qi, there must be principle (*li*). Principle is the heavenly principle (*tian li*), pure and unadulterated, sincere and without falsehood. In Buddhism, it is called *actuality*; in Daoism, *the Real*; in Confucianism, *sincerity*—yet in truth, they are one. Sincerity is the Way of Heaven, fully expounded by Zisi and Mencius. Since this sincere principle exists, there must be that which governs it: the true of Ultimate Nonbeing (*Wu Ji zhi zhen*) spoken of by Master Zhou, the essence of the Two and Five (*er wu zhi jing*). The Dao calls it the profound and obscure essence (*yao ming zhi jing*), most truly real. It is also said, "Within the true there is spirit." Thus, within the Three Powers (*san cai*), each possesses this principle and this spirit to give life.

The *Zhuangzi* states: "Do heaven and earth coexist with me? Do the myriad things and I share the same body?" This scripture encompasses heaven and earth, enfolds the Three Powers, and leaves no place unreal; hence, it is called *All-True*.

**Wenchang:** *Wen* means principle (*li*), like the veins within wood, their patterns interwoven. In ancient times, Cang Jie created characters by modeling forms after categories. *Chang* means flourishing, great—referring to the vast and abundant principles of heaven and earth. For instance, Fu Xi drew the eight trigrams based on the patterns of the River Chart (*He Tu*), establishing the Way of the Three Ultimates (*san ji*). This scripture thoroughly investigates the principles of pattern, nature, and destiny within the Three Powers, all of which emerge from the Two Qi (*er qi*) and Five Phases (*wu xing*). Thus, the Wenchang star is transformed from the qi of earth. The hexagram *Kun* (Earth) states: "Yellow skirts, supremely auspicious—pattern resides within." The hexagram *Gen* (Mountain) states: "Nothing is more flourishing than *Gen* in generating the myriad things; nothing is more complete than *Gen* in perfecting them." Hence, Master Zhou spoke of "yang transforming and yin uniting, thereby giving rise to the Five Phases." The *Scripture of Salvation* (*Du Ren Jing*) says: "The Five Patterns unfold, universally planting spiritual beings." In the southern realm of literary splendor, radiance shines brilliantly. Chapter Fourteen states: "Southern Prosperity (*Nan Chang*) emits jade-like brilliance." This refers to the Southern Prosperity Palace (*Nan Chang Gong*), governed by the Perfected of Refined Souls (*Lian Hun Zhen Ren*), where the Southern Culmen Emperor of Vermilion Numinosity (*Zhu Ling Di Jun*) resides. There, the Eight-Cornered Jade Seal of the Life-Registering Perfected Lord (*Zhu Sheng Zhen Jun*) is bestowed—what is commonly called the Southern Dipper’s life-registering, though here termed *Southern Prosperity* rather than *Wenchang*. This is the realm of literary brilliance in the Cinnabar Heavenly World (*Dan Tian Shi Jie*), transformed by Brahma-qi (*fan qi*), known as the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace (*Nan Chang Shang Gong*). Today, the Vermilion Numinosity Grotto-Heaven (*Zhu Ling Dong Tian*) of Mount Heng in the Southern Marchmount corresponds to the astral mansions of *Kui* (Straddler) and *Zhen* (Winnowing Basket). Initially, the radiance of *Kui* and *Bi* (Wall) descended, and the Emperor commanded their stewardship over culture. *Bi* resides in the *Hai* (12th Earthly Branch) position, governing charts and books; *Kui* resides in the *Xu* (11th Earthly Branch) position, governing literature. For *Kui* possesses literary splendor, and *Bi* stores books. After the fall of the House of Ying, ancient texts were discovered within a wall—thus, *Bi* has contributed to culture. Hence, the Wenchang Palace includes the Eastern Wall Repository of Charts and Books (*Dong Bi Tu Shu Fu*). Within the Supreme Subtlety Enclosure (*Tai Wei Yuan*), there is the Fifth Star of the Southern Dipper, the Perfected Lord of Refined Souls of Wenchang (*Wen Chang Lian Hun Zhen Jun*), as well as the Palace of the Nine Qi of the Grand Supreme Wenchang (*Tai Shang Jiu Qi Wen Chang Gong*), the stars of the Wenchang Upper Minister (*Wen Chang Shang Xiang*), and the Wenchang Upper General (*Ci Xiang Shang Jiang*). There is also the Wenchang Chart of Flowing Circulation (*Wen Chang Tu Liu Yun*), which generates and transforms cultural artifacts. Thus, within heaven and earth, the Way of generation, completion, and transformation is none greater than this. Hence, it is said: "Opening the Three Luminaries, this is the root of heaven. Without pattern, there is no illumination; without pattern, there is no clarity; without pattern, there is no establishment; without pattern, there is no completion; without pattern, there is no deliverance; without pattern, there is no life." All these statements are founded upon this.

The *Book of Changes* states: "Things intermingle; hence, it is called *pattern* (*wen*)." Thus, this *Wenchang Scripture* is the unifying thread, just as the *Appended Judgments* say: "Transforming and moving without abiding, circulating through the six positions, ascending and descending without constancy, adapting to change alone." It also states: "Alternating and combining to change, interweaving their numbers, penetrating their changes to form the patterns of heaven and earth"—this is the same meaning. Therefore, Wenchang in the world is the root-source of education and transformation.

**Great Cavern (Da Dong):** *Great* means that even the vastness of heaven and earth cannot surpass it. *Cavern* means pervading—all things universally possess this principle, which is the Supreme Ultimate. Once the Supreme Ultimate divides, the Three Powers of heaven, earth, and humanity each attain their proper positions. It is said that each thing possesses a Supreme Ultimate; thus, in general, it is called the Great Cavern. This aligns with the teachings expounded by Master Shao and the principles set forth by Jizi in the *Way of the Royal Ultimate* (*Huang Ji*). Among the scriptures and registers of the Daoist methods, the Three Caverns exist, with the Great Cavern being the highest.

**Immortal Scripture (Xian Jing):** *Scripture* (*jing*) means the path (*you*)—the correct way universally traversed by the myriad things. The Confucian classics—*Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, *Book of Changes*, *Book of Rites*, *Analects*, *Mencius*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals*—are all scriptures. Cultivating the Dao is called teaching; hence, it is termed *Immortal Scripture*. The Primordial Beginning (*Yuan Shi*) recognized that each person is endowed with this principle, so he clarified the ranks and precepts to serve as the foundation of education and transformation, enabling ghosts, spirits, and humans alike to return to their root-source. By cultivating and advancing where they are endowed, it becomes the swiftest path to learning the Dao and seeking immortality. If one can trace the origin and grasp the end, returning to seek within oneself, then heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all complete within me.

**Wenchang Aligns with the Changes:** The title *Ultimate Nonbeing, All-True Wenchang Great Cavern* appears inverted and improper. It should follow the order: *Ultimate Nonbeing, Wenchang, All-True, Great Cavern*. *Ultimate Nonbeing* refers to the movement and stillness of yin and yang within the Supreme Ultimate. *Wenchang* refers to the Five Phases. *All-True* refers to the Qian Way (*Qian Dao*) forming the male and the Kun Way (*Kun Dao*) forming the female. *Great Cavern* refers to the transformation and generation of the myriad things.

The Scripture states: "The ten thousand qi give birth to the ten thousand spirits." Thus it is said: The *Taiji* Diagram is the *Book of Changes* in its entirety, while the *Wuji* Diagram is the *Wenchang Great Cavern* in its entirety—this has already been made clear within the diagrams. Yet as time passes, change becomes difficult, and lest it sow doubt among the multitude, we provisionally retain the old conventions.

Moreover, this *Scripture* differs not from the *Changes*: the *Changes* takes Qian and Kun as its gate, while the *Scripture* takes heaven and earth as its foundation. The gate is function; the foundation is substance. Look up to observe the patterns of heaven; look down to examine the principles of earth—principles, too, are patterns. The patterns of heaven are the sixty celestial stems and branches, the sun, moon, and stars arrayed across the thirty-two heavens. The patterns of earth are the sixty-four hexagrams aligned with the thirty-six earthly mounds. The patterns of humanity are the qi of the spirits congealed within the thirty-six palaces and three hundred sixty joints of the body—these correspond to the thirty-two heavens beyond the *Duren Scripture*: the Miro Heaven, Qingwei Heaven, Yuyu Heaven, and Great Red Heaven. The thirty-six earths are the nine earthly mounds, each divided into four earthly sovereigns, totaling thirty-six earthly sovereigns, who collectively govern the expanse of the world. When extended, Qian’s tally is two hundred and sixteen, and Kun’s tally is one hundred and forty-four, their combined tally of three hundred and sixty matching the number of degrees in the celestial circuit of the sun. In smaller measure, the yang lines follow this: each yang line is thirty-six, corresponding to the four nines of the metal tally.

Now, the opening chapter of the *Great Cavern* consists of twenty-two four-character lines, totaling eighty-eight characters, placed above to correspond to the *Wuji*. Beyond this, the main text of the five-character scripture comprises thirty-six chapters, totaling six hundred and twenty lines. Each line corresponds to one line of a hexagram in the *Changes*, and the sixty-four hexagrams yield three hundred and eighty-four lines, which are matched by Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—twenty-four lines in all. The ancients placed these at the four cardinal directions, but this is incorrect. For Qian and Kun are the great parents, giving birth to the six children, while Kan and Li are the parents of the myriad things, the root of all generation. They should be placed at the center of the *Taiji*. The remaining six hexagrams, with their three hundred and sixty lines, are distributed across the twelve months, corresponding above to the celestial circuit of the fire phases. The remaining two hundred and thirty-six lines are divided: two hundred lines are distributed among the four cardinal directions to correspond to the four images. For *Taiyi*, *Taichu*, *Taishi*, and *Taisu*, fifty lines are assigned to each direction, yielding eight-line hexagrams. Each hexagram has six lines, totaling forty-eight lines. Two additional lines are taken to distinguish the odd and even of yin and yang, thus completing the four images. Another thirty-six lines are placed within the central palace to correspond to the *Taiji*, yielding six hexagrams—this is what is meant by "gold entering the earthen cauldron, the elixir vessel perfected." The scripture totals four thousand and ninety-six characters, which is to say, the *Changes* transforms into four thousand and ninety-six hexagrams.

Through this explanation, it becomes clear that the *Wenchang* is none other than the *Book of Changes*. The *Changes* contains the four ways of the sage; the *Scripture* contains five: to exhaust the origins of heaven and earth, one upholds the *Wuji*; to preserve the integrity of one’s nature and life, one upholds *All-True*; to investigate the principles of yin and yang, one upholds *Wenchang*; to fathom the wonders of spirit and transformation, one upholds the *Great Cavern*; to savor the profundities of its words and flavors, one upholds the *Immortals’ Scripture*. If Qian and Kun are destroyed, the *Changes* cannot be seen; if yin and yang are sundered, the *Wenchang* cannot be seen. The *Scripture*, too, is the Way of simplicity and ease.

The security in which the noble person dwells is the order of the *Scripture*; what delights and inspires him is the diction of its verses. How wondrous! The rest may be extended by analogy, awaiting the scholars of future ages.

Kneeling in reverence, Qi Zai bows.

The Venerable Master Tai Xuan Dao Father Niu Zi initiated the inquiry and compiled the scripture; the Primordial Emperor of the Nine Heavens, Opener of Transformation, revised the *Mysterious Covenant* and composed the preface; the August Personage of Wenchang, the Mystic Sage of the Dao, presides over the *Chart of Wenchang* and oversees the scripture.

The *Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture*, with Tai Xuan Dao Father as its progenitor, is the master of celestial scripture compilation. The Primordial Emperor follows as the first to disseminate this scripture among humanity. The August Personage of Wenchang follows as the progenitor who governs the revolving life-*qi*, presides over culture and education, and assists in the august enterprise of emperors.

According to the *Inner and Outer Biographies of the August Lord*, the *Book of Transformations*, and the scripture’s preface, the August Lord was born in Wu Hui (present-day Pingjiang) in the *yisi* year of King Wu of Zhou’s reign. He received the *Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture* from the Three Perfected Ones. Through diligent recitation, he repeatedly attained spiritual responses, receiving golden icons and ritual registers. His practice of salvation proved efficacious, and he thus realized the sagely fruition of the Great Cavern’s wondrous practice.

Therefore, he composed the preface and *Mysterious Covenant* to enlighten the world. Though the scripture has never been absent from the Four Seas, it has, through repeated wars and fires, at times been lost and left untransmitted. Today, it circulates in Shu, where the people deeply believe in it, for the August Lord is revered as a great deity in Shu. From the Tang dynasty to the present, successive dynasties have honored him, and Wang Jian built a temple in his name. Thus, the August Lord specializes in transforming and saving people through this scripture, and many have attained the Dao by virtue of it.

In essence, this scripture has been transmitted among humanity since the time of King Wu of Zhou, over two thousand years ago. Thus, some characters may contain minor errors, which is hardly surprising. Fortunately, successive generations of perfected beings have verified and arranged it in order. Those who recite it need not doubt one version or be confused by another. With utmost sincerity and single-minded devotion, practicing even a single sentence can elevate one to the rank of highest immortality.

Some say it differs from the *Shangqing Great Cavern Scripture*. I, Qi, reply: The Three Mountains each possess their own scriptures and registers, and their methods are not uniform. Moreover, this is the *Jade Purity Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture*. Those of discernment all recognize the unity of the Dao; only the shallow-minded perceive differences.

**The Wenchang Assembly**
At the Wenchang Assembly, there were the Chan Masters Tongwu and Bolun, along with various Chan masters of Shu—all emanations of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva—who together inherited the ritual arena, naming it the *Mind-Pearl Assembly*. They took the August Lord as their leader. Each year, on the birthdays of the masters, Buddhist monks from all mountains would hold grand assemblies, widely propagating incense and fire rituals, offering celebrations and praises. Officials, merchants, scholars, and commoners all revered them in great numbers. Thus, the scriptures and rituals of the two teachings often blended and were used interchangeably.

There were also the Precious Radiance Heavenly Worthy’s *Perfect Penetration Ritual Arena*, where the Dharma seat was shaken, the Emperor’s Bell sounded, and Sanskrit mantras were chanted. Ninefold circumambulations were performed, along with Water and Land Dharma Assemblies and other rites. Some who fail to comprehend may claim the language is impure.

It is not impure. Generally, the character *Dao* adapts only to principle. Where principle resides, the Dao is fundamentally the same. Why distinguish between the two teachings? Only those who cannot fully investigate and exhaust it generate divergent views, leading to doubt and confusion. If one cannot firmly establish this mind, how can one seek the pure and unified principle of the Dao?

Moreover, the Great Emperor was renowned in his time as a great Confucian scholar. He devoted himself to the ancient classics and, during the Tai Kang era of the Jin, led his entire family to ascend as immortals at Fengdong. Successive dynasties honored him as the patriarch of culture. He first encountered the Most High, who bestowed the elixir, enabling him to realize the Dao’s fruition. Later, he met Śākyamuni, who conferred prediction, allowing him to realize the Great Vehicle. Thus, among the three teachings, he upheld the true Dharma.

In the present imperial Yuan dynasty, successive imperial edicts have bestowed praise and honor, renaming the *Lingying Temple* as the *Shrine of Right Culture and Transformation*. This shrine is a state ritual site, distinct from other temples dedicated to deities. He was further enfeoffed as *August Lord of Assisting the Primordial, Opening Transformation, Wenchang, Administering Fortune, and Vast Benevolence*. Among all deities, those granted the title of emperor are exceedingly rare.

I, Qi, am a native of Shu. The temples of Shu need no further proclamation. From my travels across seas and mountains, wherever I go, I seek out numinous traces, and they are found everywhere—Mount Hao being the most prominent. Thus, the flourishing of incense and fire rituals is such that his blessings in safeguarding families and the state, and in aiding both the living and the deceased, are immeasurable.

It is also known that the Wenchang Palace’s officials and subordinates are numerous and well-ordered. Here, I present the sacred taboo names and birthdays of the Wenchang lineage for those who uphold the Wenchang incense fire to know:

The Great Emperor’s taboo names across lifetimes: Shanxun, Zhongsi, Xiaozhong, Ruyi, Xun, Jun.

The above are not to be avoided.

The ancient name was "Evil Child," later omitting the middle and lower characters, leaving only the taboo name "Ya," with the courtesy name "Xianfu." Those who compose documents or memorials must strictly avoid these.

The third day of the second month marks his birth.

Left Minister, the Lady of the Dugu clan, born on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, is the reincarnation of Xu Jingshan. For her merit in slaying the mirage beast of Qiongzhou, she was enfeoffed across dynasties with an eight-character royal title. Now, she presides over the left ranks of Wenchang, commanding an entourage of one thousand two hundred, and is honored as the Broad-Blessing Auspicious Responsive Overflowing Trustworthy Kind King.

Right Minister, Li Fu, born on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, was likewise enfeoffed across dynasties with an eight-character royal title for his merit in breaking the forces of Fu Jian. Now, he presides over the right ranks of Wenchang, commanding an entourage of one thousand two hundred, and is honored as the Heroic Kind Loyal Fierce Winged Aid Right-Assisting King.

**Method of Focused Visualization**

Whenever one wishes to recite the *Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture*, one should rise at dawn before worldly affairs intrude, bathe in fragrant waters, don fresh garments, observe purification rites, and enter the chamber. Lighting twenty candles and holding incense, face north and stand in reverent order. Recite the purifying incantation, offer fragrant smoke to the sages, state one’s intent, and perform the ritual invitation. Present nine portions of tea and fruits as offerings—if tea is unavailable, nine cups of pure water will suffice. The essential matter is utmost sincerity; rigid adherence is unnecessary.

Then, facing east, sit in repose. Draw in the vital qi of life, still the breath, and settle the mind, allowing no stray or reckless thoughts. With both eyes, inwardly behold the Yellow Court, emptying even the emptiness, until stillness is achieved. After a time, visualize the green qi within the liver transforming into a Bluegreen Dragon, standing to the left; the white qi within the lungs becoming a White Tiger, standing to the right; the red qi within the heart becoming a Vermilion Bird, standing before; and the black qi within the kidneys becoming a Dark Warrior, standing behind. One’s own body sits upon a nine-colored lotus throne, above and below which ride nine-headed lions. The Three Primordials Generals and Four Sage Marshals stand in attendance.

Next, visualize the Three Treasures of Heaven’s Center and the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Lord above the head, emitting nine beams of radiant light that penetrate the nine palaces of the head and the nine apertures of the body. Then, envision the thirty-two Celestial Emperors and the sixty celestial stems and earthly branches of one’s natal star officials, their light descending to illuminate the five viscera, six bowels, thirty-six palaces within the body, and extending downward to the Earth Sovereigns of the thirty-six lands, from the Bubbling Spring to the Muddy Pellet, uniting heaven and earth in luminous clarity, each detail distinct.

Next, visualize the green qi of the liver transforming into Wu Ying, the white qi of the lungs into Bai Yuan, the red qi of the heart into the Controller of Fate, the black qi of the kidneys into Tao Kang, and the Great One residing in the head—these five spirits are the ancestors of all spirits and are thus first to be visualized. If a Daoist is performing the Morning Audience, their cap and robes should correspond to the colors of the respective directions, standing in attendance to the left, right, front, and rear.

Then, visualize the ten thousand qi and ten thousand spirits, each in accordance with the method, reciting the incantations. Command the spirits with the mind while reciting with the mouth. Upon completion, begin reciting the scripture in a soft voice, without coarse breath or loud shouting, but with precise and concentrated visualization. This is the ancient immortal’s method for reciting the Three Caverns scriptures, wherein the Five Emperors’ Jade Lads and Jade Maidens attend as protectors, and the majestic spirits guard in accordance with the scripture—this must not be treated lightly.

The recorded experiences and verifications are exhaustive and may be studied and pondered in private. At times, celestial perfected beings may descend, earthly deities may witness the rite, or the spirits within one’s own body may manifest, as when Xiao Weiyi saw the Four Beasts take form—all results of meticulous visualization. Those who cherish the Dao should each adhere to these practices.

**Preface to the Wenchang Great Cavern Immortal Scripture**
**Preface and Mystic Concordance by the Nine Heavens’ Transformative Sovereign, the True and Luminous Treasure Radiance Heavenly Worthy**

Born in the vast kalpa, I lived as a humble laborer. One day, while tilling the soil, I unearthed a golden statue. The village elders identified it as the likeness of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, cast in metal by the Great Yu during his flood-taming labors to pacify the sacred peaks. I honored it with incense and offerings, never once neglecting my devotion. When a sea storm surged beyond human strength to resist, I, on behalf of the people, cast the golden statue into the raging waves. Thereupon, the winds and tides receded, and the entire region was spared.

After long reflection, one night upon the sandy shoals, a light stretched across the sky. Digging, I recovered the same statue and returned it to build a temple for its veneration, where the villagers and I worshipped together. Over the years, the numinous responses were too numerous to record.

My parents, alas, perished in an epidemic. After mourning and burying them, I kept vigil at their graves, tending the mounds until they were well established. One day, three divine beings—clad in hempen headscarves, feathered robes, and straw sandals—visited me and bestowed a volume of the *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture*, saying: “Recite it morning and evening, and you will surely attain good fruits. Among the Three Powers, above, it may aid in serving your parents and ancestors, liberating their souls from dark suffering; in the middle, it may eradicate sins, dispel calamities, prolong life, and increase destiny; below, it may protect your clan and save others, ensuring collective preservation. You may offer gold and silk to us three, and we will transmit this on your behalf.”

That very day, I followed their instructions, preparing a vegetarian feast and presenting gold and silk to receive the teaching. Thereafter, I recited the scripture morning and evening without fail, repeatedly experiencing numinous responses. Once, during a sweltering summer, a great flood submerged my parents’ graves. I reverently presented the golden statue and recited the *Great Cavern Scripture*, vowing to complete a thousand recitations to ensure their safety. The following autumn, incessant rains caused the nearby streams to swell and merge. Fearing the worst, I waited for the waters to recede and saw that the valley before the graves had transformed into a broad, firm ridge over a mile wide. From then on, the pines and catalpas remained unharmed.

I often reflected on my parents’ deaths from pestilence, hating the plague demons with a bone-deep enmity. Though the paths of the living and the dead diverge, and I lacked the power to exact vengeance, I diligently recited the *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture* morning and night, praying fervently to the golden statue, beseeching it to grant me the power to subdue the plague demons.

Three years later, I suddenly dreamed that the golden statue spoke to me: “You have mastered the *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture*, but you have not yet seen the *Great Cavern Register of Methods*. Today, I shall bestow it upon you to subdue evil demons. Not only will this fulfill your original vow, but it will also aid heaven’s transformative work and assist the nation in saving the people.” From its sleeve, it produced two books, which I received with bows. One was titled *Great Cavern Register*, the other *Great Cavern Methods*. Upon waking, the two books lay before my pillow. I prepared a vegetarian feast and placed them in a repository for safekeeping.

Choosing an auspicious day, I took them out to read. Upon reaching the passage, “One myriad of the Heavenly Couriers’ armored soldiers descend,” suddenly, wind and thunder darkened the day, and countless figures in golden armor and crimson sashes arrayed themselves before me, bowing to receive my command. One holding a red banner stepped forward and said, “We await your orders.” Startled, I unconsciously raised my voice and commanded: “I require you to subdue the plague demons. The household of Prefect Zhang in this village is stricken—go and drive them out!” The banner-bearer led over a hundred soldiers into the house. In an instant, they emerged, capturing five demons: one clad in tiger skin, one crowned with a rooster, one with a human face, one with a crow’s head, and one with a donkey’s head. They wielded implements of water, fire, feathers, sickles, axes, and chisels. Enraged, I rebuked them, about to annihilate their forms.

Then they offered their defense, saying: "We, the Yuanbo and our kind, arise from the yearly cyclical movements and are formed by the annual *qi*. Our travels follow fixed directions, and our afflictions target specific people. Those who suffer grave yin retribution bear its calamity; those whose heavenly mandate is severed meet their death—this is not something we, the Yuanbo, dare claim as our own doing. It begins with the Three Officials and Five Peaks submitting a memorial to the Jade Emperor, presenting the transgressions of mortals. Thereupon, the Emperor commands the Three Officials and Five Peaks to spread disease. The Year King, according to the register, issues writs and dispatches us, the Yuanbo, to act strictly in accordance with the records. If the True Officer grants us leniency, we shall henceforth abide by your constraints. Whenever we encounter the plague, we will not dare approach wherever your talismans and scriptures reside."

Thereupon, I instructed them in accordance with the scriptural methods and sent them away. For those in the village afflicted by plague, I provided talismans and rituals, and all were preserved and revived. By means of these scriptures and talismans, I have saved countless from illness and suffering. My name spread far and wide, and scholars, commoners, officials, and clerks flocked to my door seeking cures—innumerable in number. My accumulation of profound merit and wondrous deeds all stem from upholding the *Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals*, through which I obtained the *Great Cavern Talismans*. Thus, I fully harnessed divine efficacy, instantly rectifying and expelling evil, delivering the living, transcending the dead, dispelling misfortune, and prolonging life.

Later, in the unseen realms, mighty spirits and deities from temple altars came to beseech me to recite scriptures for their benefit, expressing gratitude: "By the power of the True Officer’s scriptures, our might and virtue have been augmented, and our names inscribed in the registers of the virtuous. Some were lingering souls and stagnant spirits unable to be reborn; they came in dreams or through possession to beg for my recitation of scriptures to aid their deliverance. All gave thanks, saying: 'By the power of the True Officer’s scriptures, we have escaped suffering and attained rebirth.'"

When seasonal epidemics spread unchecked, one need only recite this scripture and employ the talismans within its methods—*Talismans for Dispatching Plague, Severing Plague, and Halting Plague*—to command the celestial couriers and armored soldiers above, as well as the *Officers Who Seize Plague and Devour Plague, Officers Who Seize Poison and Devour Poison, Officers Who Seize Evil and Devour Evil, Officers Who Seize Qi and Devour Qi, Officers Who Seize Ghosts and Devour Ghosts, Officers Who Seize Calamity and Devour Calamity, Officers Who Seize Essences and Devour Essences, Divine Healers, Officers Who Destroy Talismans and Demolish Temples*—the Nine Ranks of the Mighty Generals of the Orthodox Unity, each leading their armored troops, along with the Five Hundred Million Black Riders of the Northern Celestial Officials, the Venerable Cang Lao, the Maiden Magu, the Vajra Warriors, and others, to capture them.

First, a writ is sent to the Year King, then a petition is submitted to Mount Tai. The City Gods and Earth Gods are delegated to dispatch the Plague Envoys. If, upon hearing the scriptures, they defy the covenant and refuse to withdraw, they are then memorialized and annihilated.

The Great Dao cherishes compassion; the Supreme Clarity is ever benevolent. The August Emperor favors life and extends mercy to halt killing. Those who practice the scriptural methods and talismans must not act with private malice or cruelty, lest they incur heavenly retribution. One should dispatch them with propriety, honor them with scriptures, awe them with talismans, and exhort them with virtuous deeds—this is the swiftest path of expedient cultivation.

Those who practice these scriptures and talismans should deliberate carefully to establish profound merit. This scripture can resolve karmic entanglements, halt retributive trials, dissolve oral curses, absolve offenses, pacify graves and dwellings, stabilize military and government offices, quell warfare, halt epidemics, pray for wind and rain, summon auspicious omens, ensure silkworm and grain harvests, protect life and body, shield clans and kin, rescue villages and communities, secure borders, restrain insects and tigers, end droughts and floods, eradicate demons and monsters, suppress collective misfortunes, repel malevolent stars and dark portents, honor ancestral sacrifices and temple deities, aid the deliverance of ancestral souls, relieve destitute spirits and stagnant souls—these constitute the twenty-four supreme merits of Wenchang, corresponding to the twenty-four *qi* of the year, for which one may hold fasts, recite scriptures, and perform rituals to avert and give thanks.

For other ailments and the eradication of poisons, there is the *Divine Prescription of the Purple Court Celestial Physician*, a remnant grace of the Golden Queen of Yu the Great, extending to all generations, sparing people from untimely deaths and freeing them from the scourge of epidemics. Those who receive these teachings should seek out and study them to attain profound merit.

I have attained the fruit of the *Most High Unassuming and Joyous Nurturing Heavenly Emperor, the Clarified and True Contemplation Treasure Radiance Compassionate Response Life-Prolonging Heavenly Worthy*, truly through diligent recitation of scriptures, thereby ascending to the nobility of the Supreme Clarity. Those who receive and recite these scriptures should strive to practice them, wishing to join all within the Wenchang assembly in ascending to wondrous deeds.

Respectfully recorded.

**Imperial Decree of Yuan Dynasty:**
By the Mandate of Heaven, the Sacred Edict of the Emperor:
In the manifest realm, there are rites and music; in the hidden realm, there are spirits and deities. The subtle and the evident are one in essence. In heaven, they become stars and constellations; on earth, rivers and mountains. Their forms and functions operate between the two realms, yet how could they remain concealed within the great Way? They must be honored with solemn ceremonies.

The Emperor of Wenchang of the Seven Curves Mountain’s Zhang-Dong Palace, whose light emanates from the Zhang constellation and whose friendship is praised in the *Book of Songs*, has aided our prosperous reign with loyalty and filial piety, guiding the people. He has illuminated our civil virtues with scholarly success, selecting and cultivating many talents. Whenever he has rescued us from disasters, his responsive manifestations of reward and punishment have been evident. The decrees on imperial examinations have been reissued, and the records of assessments have been predetermined. Though adorned with splendor, his fame has not yet fully satisfied our heart.

Alas! We desire an abundance of literary talent—may you brilliantly manifest the spirit of the Jiang and Han rivers. We desire civil governance—may you dredge and display the treasury of the Kui and Bi constellations. To bestow a fitting title in response to your illustrious light, you shall be additionally enfeoffed as *Imperial Lord Wenchang, Assistant Originator of Transformation, Bestower of Emoluments, and Vastly Benevolent Emperor*.

Let the relevant officials carry this out.

Issued on a day in the seventh month of the third year of the Yanyou era.

Perfect in the myriad practices,
Fully realized in divine penetrations,

**Eulogy of the Great Cavern Scripture by the True Person Zheng Yuansou**

**Eulogizing the Treasured Scripture**
1.
The Great Cavern True Scripture is the Great Vehicle,
Profound and abstruse, reaching the ultimate mystery.
The immortals and sages of the ten directions and three times,
Through cultivation and accomplishment, attain the Primordial Azure.

**Proclaiming the Mysterious and Wondrous**
2.
The Three Caverns and Three Vehicles are not easily fathomed,
The August Emperor’s wondrous words are flawless.
All scriptures and myriad dharmas return to the ancestral origin,
Through understanding and awakening, one ascends the kalpic abode.

**Exhorting the Present Age**
3.
Emperors, ministers, and nobles,
Prefects, officials, and common folk:
Wealth, honor, glory, and splendor are no other matters,
Than to investigate the profound principles of the Great Cavern in its entirety.

**Admonishing the Three Teachings**
4.
Though the black-robed and yellow-robed teachings differ in path,
Those who hear rites and hear poetry are gentlemen scholars.
All may recite and uphold the True Great Cavern,
Which is prior to Heaven and Earth, the One of Primordial Emptiness.

**Inducing and Exhorting**
5.
All kings and people who study the Complete Truth and cultivate the Dao,
Waste their minds on the myriad methods and thousand gates.
Should one recite the Immortal Scripture of the Great Cavern ten thousand times,
The August Emperor and Venerable Master Lao will naturally become one’s confidants.

**Devout Men and Women**
6.
The civil and military officials of the world,
Prostitutes, commoners, and all their peers:
All may wholeheartedly uphold the Great Cavern,
Severing the roots of sin and roaming with the spirits.

**Determined Realization of Fruition**
7.
The true essence of the Great Cavern differs from other scriptures,
Ascending as immortals and entering as sages to meet the Mysterious True.
Though one may recite eighty thousand scriptures through kalpas as numerous as dust motes,
Only by perfect realization does one become the Supreme Person of the August Emperor.

**Lamenting the Ignorant Multitude**
8.
Alas! The dull and unenlightened multitude,
How could they recognize the pearl of the floating millet?
The Great Cavern delivers all as one body,
Easily ascending to the Mysterious Capital from the common ground.

**Expedient Exhortation**
9.
Should one wish to cultivate and attain the Supreme Vehicle,
How could anything compare to the few chapters of the Great Cavern?
Exhausting the mind and nature in the method of cultivating the body,
One awakens to ascend the Great Possession’s court.

**Karmic Conditions and Encounters**
10.
I, on account of all disciples, have this scripture engraved,
Composing eulogies to praise this scripture.
Its merit is towering, its treasury inexhaustible,
The wondrous Dao of the August Emperor is originally formless.

**Eulogy of the Great Cavern Scripture of the August Emperor of the Primordial Heaven**

**Origins and Causes**
Year Star:

Cloud scripts were formed to deliver heaven and humanity.
The Father of the Great Dao of the Supreme Mystery sought and received it,
And only then was the Great Cavern Scripture heard in the world below.

**Cultivating the True and Studying the Dao**
Beginning of Spring:
The common folk of the great earth study to awaken to the true,

**Praying for Emoluments, Official Position, and Offspring**

The misfortunes of monthly and yearly afflictions linger in the body,

Familiarize yourself with the Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture.

The Jade Emperor, Great Dao Sovereign,
The Supreme Mystery, True Dao Father.
I bow to the Lord of the Supreme Mystery Heaven, the boundless Primordial Vault,

Emerges from the earth’s gate in golden radiance,
Manifesting as three divine persons,
Clad in kudzu garments, bestowing golden treasures.
In dreams, they tuck two books into sleeves,
Registers and methods are conferred together.
Transforming and appearing as Wenchang,
Responding to wishes, divinely efficacious.

Forever severing the roots of blood and corpse.
I present the talisman and enter the Jade Capital,
Bowing my head at the Golden Gate.

Arrayed to attend their compassionate countenance.
Wishing to receive the true faith’s rites,
They emit great wish-fulfilling light,
Responding to minds and dreams,
Ensuring posterity and amassing blessings.

Lifelong, their crane-hair flourishing in glory.

Step by step, basking in profound favor.

Abounding in wealth and treasures.

That I may learn the Dao and attain immortality.
May my karmic defilements dissolve,
So that my mind alone is the Pure Land.
Universally, with all beings of heaven and earth,
I emerge from the gates of all suffering.
Gradually advancing, gradually cultivating,
According to conditions, I realize the fruits.

*Jade Clarity, Boundless, and Supreme Truth—*
*Wenchang’s Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals, Annotated, Scroll the Third*
Annotated by Yangzi of Mount Penglai in Eastern Shu, Wei Qi

The Dao speaks: In the primordial beginning of the Dragon-Han kalpa, the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning revealed *The Jade Scripture of the Great Cavern* within the Supreme Great Possession Jade Clarity Palace.

The Dao speaks—this is the discourse of the Jade Emperor Dao Lord.
"In the past" refers to the distant antiquity of bygone ages.
"Dragon-Han" denotes the moment when the singular qi gestated within the empty vastness, at the inception of the Great Void, where above there was no further form, below no further abyss—chaotic and boundless, an expanse of surging currents. For over seven thousand kalpas, this qi circulated ceaselessly, traversing ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety li in a single year. Its transformations, like a dragon’s, were unfathomable, hence the name Dragon-Han. When the reckoning of its cycles reached its zenith, the Three Luminaries dawned, ushering in the Red Clarity. The Brahma-qi suffused the cosmos, the myriad patterns unfolded, the primordial net flowed and evolved, giving birth to heaven and earth, awakening the numinous spirits—this is called the Three Kalpas of the Kaihuang, when all became distinct.

According to *The Golden Book of Great Possession*, the Heavenly Treasure Lord was born in the first year of the Dragon-Han kalpa and revealed his scripture that same year. The Numinous Treasure Lord was born at the Dragon-Han’s unfolding of the cosmic chart, and after one kalpa, in the first year of Red Clarity, he revealed his scripture. The Divine Treasure Lord was born in the first year of Red Clarity, and after two kalpas, in the first year of the Supreme August, he revealed his scripture. Only then did the Three Treasures acquire their fixed names.

Yet the Divine Kings memorialized: When the reckoning ended in the jia-shen year, the great currents scoured away the filth. From the era of Red Clarity to the first year of the Supreme August, twenty-four myriad beings received deliverance. After the Kaihuang, when the count reached jia-shen, the heavens selected and ranked the immortals, but the offices of the immortals were left vacant. Thus, from the three generations, ten myriad were chosen to fill their ranks, and another twelve myriad were raised as reserve officials. From among the departed souls with meritorious deeds, thirty-two myriad were selected to join them. After the jia-shen purgation, the people of the Great Possession were inaugurated.

The Confucian classics state: Yao ascended the throne in the jia-chen year, and by the jia-shen year, forty years had passed before the calamity of the great flood arose. By this reckoning, *The Scripture of Spirit Generation* must have emerged before the time of Tang Yao, while *The Great Cavern Scripture* was first revealed in the first year of the Dragon-Han kalpa, when the Primordial Beginning was born and issued the scripture. Thus, it is called the primordial beginning of the Dragon-Han kalpa. By the first year of the Supreme August, when the Most High revealed his scripture, the Three Treasures had each attained their fixed positions. The Numinous Treasure was transmitted once more, then bestowed upon the Supreme Mystery while seated. Hence, the subsequent scripture states: "This treasure is revealed anew."

*The Scripture of the True Warrior* records that in the first year of the Dragon-Han kalpa, the teaching was expounded, recounting events from the first year of the Kaihuang. Yet since the Kaihuang precedes the Dragon-Han, this must be an error in the transmission of the scriptures by the various perfected ones. One should follow *The Golden Book of Great Possession*, thoroughly examining the kalpas in which the Three Treasures were born and the times when they revealed their scriptures to deliver beings—other accounts cannot be entirely trusted.

It is also said: The beginning of heaven and earth comprises five kalpas—the kalpa of inception, the kalpa of formation, the kalpa of dwelling, the kalpa of dissolution, and the kalpa of emptiness. These five kalpas cycle endlessly, and heaven and earth complete their beginning and end through them. The same applies to humans and all things.

The East is called Dragon-Han, the South Red Clarity, the West Extended Peace, the North Kaihuang, and the Center Supreme August. Starting from *zi*, every three characters denote a kalpa, reaching *xu* and *hai* as Extended Peace. In terms of the sun, this is night; in terms of humans, this is death. Beyond the six directions, we shall provisionally set aside discussion.

Since the separation of heaven and earth, as recorded in the Six Classics, the *Book of Changes* speaks of the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images, and the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams. The Two Modes are heaven and earth; the Four Images are the four seasons. Yin is quiescent, yang is dynamic—hence transformation arises. Movement and stillness have their constancy, hardness and softness are determined—thus the four seasons alternate and transform. Since transformation is ceaseless, there are kalpas and reckonings, as in the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture*. The ascent and descent of the two qi, the interweaving of the five phases—none escape the workings of number. Greatly, there are kalpas; minutely, there are epochs, all arising from years, months, days, and hours. Hours comprise quarters, days have their markers, months have their crescents, full moons, waning, and conjunctions; years have spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Thus, quarters accumulate into hours, hours into days, days into months, months into years, years into epochs, and epochs into kalpas.

Since the Supreme Ultimate divided, who can reckon how many kalpas and epochs have passed? In the first year of the Dragon-Han kalpa, the Heavenly Treasure Lord was transformed and born, and when he revealed his scripture, the palace was named the Supreme Great Possession Jade Clarity Palace. This was the capital of the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning, the inception of the perfected deities’ exposition of *The Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals*. Thus, it is the ancestor of all scriptures, the sovereign of all teachings.

All scriptures refer to the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, yet *The Great Cavern Scripture* alone calls him the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning—this is the utmost reverence. There are also the Supreme Thearch of Primordial Beginning and the Celestial Thearch of Primordial Beginning, names given according to what is perceived, for in truth, there is no fixed name. It is the various perfected ones who have forcibly named him.

The scripture states: The Great Dao is nameless, but because it engenders heaven, earth, and the myriad things, it acquires a name. Expounding the Way of the Supreme Mystery, the Double Mystery, and the Mystery of Unity, it is named *The Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals*. "Mystery" (*xuan*) is black with a tinge of red, for the northern direction’s yang stirs and generates water. The yang qi is red, the water’s color is black—hence the term *xuan*. The Supreme Mystery, the Double Mystery, and the Mystery of Unity denote the flourishing of the water qi, which is the root of heaven and earth. *Xuan* also signifies profundity and boundless vastness. Thus, the various scriptures speak of "mystery upon mystery," following this principle.

The Supreme Mystery refers to the prior existence of the mysterious qi and the primordial qi, after which the initial qi sequentially generates and grows. Thus, the unfolding of the Supreme Mystery’s qi is called the Way of the Double Mystery and the Mystery of Unity, named *The Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals*. Within its treasury are the Three Clarities’ *Great Cavern Scripture* in one hundred twenty scrolls, and the *Jade Scripture* of Mount Mao and Mount Longhu in thirty-nine chapters.

The Primordial Heavenly King of the Origin first emitted the sound of the Supreme Mystery of Unity, its resonance flowing through the Jade Clarity. For the One is the root of all transformations, the origin of all virtues, and there is no affair that does not arise from the heart. Laozi’s attainment of the One, Confucius’s thread of unity, and Master Shao’s saying—"Heaven divides creation within the One"—how could this not be so? The Way of Heaven is simply the One. The Supreme Mystery is the true qi of the north; the Two Modes established their positions, with the north as the *zi* [first] phase. The "sound of unity" refers to Heaven’s One generating water, and water corresponding to the *yu* tone. When heaven and earth first arose, they began with the number One in the north, where the initial yang stirred and gave birth to water—red in its yang qi. This is like human birth, where the yang essence coalesces to form the embryo. When yang stirs, it transforms, hence it is called "flowing resonance." It is not proclaimed by a golden mouth but is the vibration of the numinous wind, which naturally forms the Cavern Chapters.

The Vast Emperor’s Way of Singular Truth expounds the precious scripture of the Great Cavern. That which governs is called the Emperor—this is the human heart. For a state, there are the Nine Classics, yet the principle by which they are practiced is one. The One is sincerity; without delusion, it is called true reality. Thus, it is named the *Vast Emperor’s Way of Singular Truth*. Therefore, we know the *Great Cavern Scripture* is the Confucian *Doctrine of the Mean*. The "Emperor One" is the title of the Great Cavern’s Imperial Honored One. There are the Emperor One, the Male One, and the Female One—together called the Way of the Three Ones, which is the origin of the Great Cavern.

"Vast" means to unfold and to magnify, to greatly propagate this Way. Expounding the precious scripture of the Great Cavern aims to enable people to attain the One, whereby all affairs are completed. If one can focus on the One without distraction, this Way is accomplished. It is also called the "Non-Dual Dharma Gate." This is named the *Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals*. Additionally, there are the *Great Cavern’s Marrow*, the *Great Cavern’s Exegesis*, and the *Great Cavern’s Mysterious Covenant*. According to the commentaries in various scriptures, I dare not presume authority.

It reveals the methods of the Nine Governances and transmits the talismans of the Nine Radiances. The Primordial, Mysterious, and Originative Three Qi each generate nine qi, forming the Nine Emperors of the Divine Empyrean. Thus, it reveals the methods of the Nine Governances to unite with the Emperors and transmits the talismans of the Nine Radiances to gather the spirits. The Way of the Great Cavern begins with the One Qi, which generates the Three Qi; the Three Qi generate the Nine Qi; the Nine Qi generate the Ten Thousand Qi, which coalesce into the Ten Thousand Heavens. It speaks only of the Nine Qi, not the Ten Thousand Qi, to highlight the essential framework.

Within humans, the Ten Thousand Qi are complete, giving rise to the Ten Thousand Spirits. Heaven and earth are established through the Ten Thousand Qi, and the human body is born through the Ten Thousand Qi. If the spirits depart and the qi scatter, the human Way nearly ceases. This Way of the Emperor One flourishes here. Using the Nine to represent the Nine has already been expounded in the *Luo River Writing*. The Nine Heavens generate the four nines—thirty-six heavens; the Nine Earths generate the four nines—thirty-six earths. Each has its annotations below.

When a devoted scholar recites this, enters seclusion, and cultivates practice, the Ten Thousand Spirits rejoice and celebrate, the Ten Thousand Numina protect and uphold, the Ten Thousand Sages respond and connect, and the Ten Thousand Immortals gather and descend. "Seclusion" means alignment, signifying the purification and alignment of the heart’s ground, the settling of thoughts in stillness, and the prevention of disorder. The ancients practiced three days of seclusion and seven days of abstinence, or "alignment and abstinence with bathing," which is fitting for sacrificing to the Supreme Emperor. Seclusion levels the heart, while abstinence guards and stills it. If one attains the heart-seclusion of Yanzi’s "sitting in forgetfulness," this is the *Great Cavern Scripture*.

This means that when a devoted scholar practices the *Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals*, they should enter seclusion with purity, remove defilements, cease thoughts, and guard the One in stillness. Internally, the Ten Thousand Spirits rejoice and celebrate; externally, the hundred numina protect and uphold; above, the Ten Thousand Sages respond and connect; below, the Ten Thousand Immortals gather and descend. The *Chapter on Generating the Spirit* says: "When the One is intoned, the Ten Thousand Perfected harmonize; when the Nine are recited, all heavens pay homage." Such is the case.

The scripture states: "If a person can constantly abide in clarity and stillness, heaven and earth all return to them." Heaven and earth, ghosts and spirits, never aid the tyrannical in cruelty. One can transcend the Three Calamities, Four Slaughters, Five Demons, Six Harms, Seven Injuries, Eight Difficulties, Nine Tribulations, and Ten Evils. The *Dipper Scripture* records these in great detail; I will not repeat them here.

While living in the world, one encounters various demonic obstacles. Without single-minded devotion to the Supreme Way, how can one escape afflictions? The ancestral gate has a saying: "The grinding stone and whetstone harm oneself to benefit others"—this is self-restraint and serving others. Ascending as an immortal and entering sagehood, the spirit is born in the Purple Tenuity, naturally and without contrivance. The *Book of Changes* says: "Without thought, without action," which perfectly accords with the Great Cavern’s Way of naturalness. One version reads: "Ascending as an immortal and entering sagehood, awakened." One’s original spirit stands shoulder to shoulder with the Emperors of the various heavens, enjoying the bliss and freedom of heaven—how could there be contrivance? It is all the principle of naturalness.

Formerly, Yang Taiming of the Tang, having risen through Confucianism to a prominent official post and served as magistrate of Chang’an under Guo Ziyi’s command, later abandoned his position and built a thatched hut on Mount Lu. One day, while seeking the True Lord, he was visited by a descent, who said: "The Three Primordial Lords of the Grand Simplicity have commanded me to transmit to you the *Scripture of the Supreme Perfected Way of the Nine Heavens*." Upon inspection, it was the *Supreme Great Cavern Scripture*. Taiming recited it without ceasing, and in the eighth year of Emperor Xianzong’s *Yuanhe* reign, on the first day of the first month, he ascended lightly as an immortal. Was this not the "ascending as an immortal and entering sagehood" spoken of in the scripture?

It is not bound by yin and yang, the Five Phases, or the Six Qi. The Six Qi are cold, heat, wind, rain, darkness, and brightness. Heaven has the Six Qi, which descend to generate the Five Flavors, manifest as the Five Colors, and manifest as the Five Tones. Excess gives rise to the Six Illnesses. According to medical texts, yin and yang, the Five Phases, the Five Movements, and the Six Qi intertwine between heaven and earth. When harmonious, they bring auspiciousness; when in opposition, they bring misfortune. Auspiciousness brings forth sages, heaven bestows sweet dew, earth produces numinous mushrooms, the Five Grains flourish, and the people live in peace. Misfortune causes heaven and earth to close, the worthy to hide, celestial portents and disasters to appear, mountains to collapse, seas to dry up, and people to perish—all constrained by the Five and Six.

Cultivators should shed the shell of the Five Phases and depart from the mechanisms of the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams belong to earth; those who focus on the Supreme Way transcend them. The Way of Earth models itself on the Way of Heaven, and thus yin and yang cannot constrain them.

Each thought grows and deepens, advancing into the Great Vehicle. When its vastness knows no bounds, the myriad heavens gaze below, the Jade Emperor descends to witness, and flying immortals come to escort. This very thought is the Golden Elixir. Its mechanism must ceaselessly revolve, continuously and subtly present. If one’s thought remains unshaken, each thought following the last, growing in succession, one progresses to awaken to the Great Vehicle, and further to the Supreme Vehicle. In spreading this Dao, the heavenly emperors and kings observe from above, the Supreme Emperor bestows his gaze, and flying immortals and demon kings protect and elevate one’s being.

In former times, Gao Yunju recited the *Great Cavern Scripture*. One day, celestial emissaries descended to observe and spoke with him in kindness. Later, Yunju ascended as an immortal—was this not the gaze of the myriad heavens? Countless ancestors across ten thousand kalpas, wandering souls and stagnant spirits, all attain rebirth. Before one has crossed over oneself, one first delivers one’s ancestors. How much more so for the innumerable ancestors from a thousand myriad kalpas past—wandering luminous souls and sunken spirits—all ascend to higher realms.

In the Jin dynasty, Xu Jingyang and Wu, the Immortal Elder of Ge, both ascended as immortals through offering rites and refining solitary souls and spirits. For these solitary souls are also ancestors from a thousand lives and ten thousand kalpas. Noble lineages connect with immortals, and their descendants become perpetual nobles. Generations of descendants, of illustrious lineage, continue in communion with immortals, enduring in the world as exalted beings—like Zhang Zifang and the hereditary Celestial Masters, whose succession stretches unbroken.

When merit is complete and the Dao perfected, flesh and bone ascend together. When merit is fulfilled and conduct perfected, virtue and power fill to abundance, and an entire family—flesh and bone—ascends as one, as when Xu Jingyang and his forty-two kin lifted their dwelling in broad daylight. Riding dragons and driving clouds, they ascend to pay homage in the Jade Purity. Transforming one’s own yin and yang qi into dragon and cloud, one mounts them to soar through the heavens, ascending to the sacred realm of Jade Purity to attend the Primordial Sovereign of the Three Purities as a minister.

The Primordial Heavenly King chants the Supreme Mystery, concentrating spirit in profound contemplation to utter the Cavern Chapters. The Primordial One intones the qi of the Supreme Mystery into sound, gathering spirit and qi in deep and distant thought, refining spirit and qi to precision, and only then speaks the precious chapters of the Great Cavern. It is as if one must ponder before attaining—uttering the Cavern Chapters is not mere oral recitation, but the coalescence of spirit and qi, illuminating the void to form sound.

The Supreme Cavern Primordial—this chapter names the Most High Lord of the Void, the August Sovereign of the Great Cavern, who presides over the entire scripture. The characters within the chapter are divided into sections for their meanings, so it is briefly summarized here.

The Primordial One was born before the Great Non-Being and the beginningless beginning, before the first signs of the Five Ultimates. A single qi transformed within the void, formless and nameless, without qi or image, without color or light—what Master Zhou called the Limitless. With one movement and one stillness, one yin and one yang, yang transforms and yin unites, giving rise to the Five Phases: Supreme Change, Supreme Beginning, Supreme Origin, Supreme Simplicity, and Supreme Ultimate. Today’s Great Cavern is the *Book of Changes*’ Supreme Ultimate.

The Most High is exalted beyond all naming—it is the Limitless. The Primal Chaos and Great Non-Being is the primordial qi of the Primordial One, born within the undivided void, at the beginning of the Great Non-Being. *Yuan* means beginning, hence the name Primordial One. Some call it Primal Chaos, which is also fitting. The present text lacks the character *yuan*; it should be added. Thus, the Primordial One is called the Most High Primal Chaos of the Great Non-Being, the Numinous Treasure calls it the Red Primal Chaos of the Great Non-Being, and the Lord Lao calls it the Dark and Tranquil Mystery-Pervading Origin. Together, they are called the Three Origins—not the Three Origins of heaven, earth, and water, but the ancestral qi that gives birth to heaven and establishes earth.

The Heavenly Treasure is the title of the Primordial One as the Heavenly Treasure Venerable Lord. The Jade Emperor is not the common Jade Emperor; jade symbolizes virtue, for its nature is warm and moist yet firm and hard. *Huang* means great. The Primordial One, with his own qi of utmost greatness and hardness, established heaven and earth, bringing forth things and accomplishing affairs—what Mencius called the vast and flowing qi that fills heaven and earth.

The Origin gives birth to the Nine Heavens. The Origin is the foremost of virtues, for it is the ancestor of all transformations. Here, *yuan* refers to the Three Origins. The Three Qi generate the Nine Qi, which are the Nine Heavens of spirit generation. Heaven, earth, and the myriad things could not be born without the nurturing of the Three Origins and the guidance of the Nine Qi. Thus, the Three Qi are the honor of heaven and earth, and the Nine Qi are the root of the myriad things. Those who cultivate them unite their virtue with the Three Qi and align with the Nine Qi. From this point onward, the Dao of ceaseless generation becomes manifest. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: "The great virtue of heaven and earth is called generation."

Other versions read "Supreme Cavern Mystery," which is surely an error.

The Qi Ancestor is the Great Non-Being. The Three Qi of the Mysterious Origin were born before the Great Non-Being, coalescing from the void to generate qi. Qi is born from emptiness, emptiness from beginning, beginning from origin, and origin from mystery. Thus, it is called the Qi Ancestor of the Great Non-Being—this is the source of the Great Dao, where being arises from non-being.

The Multitude of Winds begets the Mysterious. One version reads "Ancestral Wind," which is incorrect. *Feng* means qi. *Zhong* means not one. The qi of the Primal Chaos and Great Non-Being Origin comprises ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety thousand qi. The qi of the Red Primal Chaos of the Great Non-Being Origin comprises ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety-nine thousand qi. The qi of the Dark and Tranquil Mystery-Pervading Origin comprises ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety thousand qi. For the myriad qi root in the Nine Qi, the Nine Qi begin with the Three Qi, and the Three Qi return to the One Qi. Thus, it is called the Multitude of Winds begetting the Mysterious. *Yin* means succession, continuation, and lineage. The root and lineage emerge from the mysterious qi—this is called the Returning Wind’s Primal Union.

Once scattered kin are reunited. One version reads "governed and scattered," which is mistaken. If there were governance, there would be constraint—how could there be scattering? When one cultivates this Cavern, the three generations of ancestors, nine lineages, five clans, and six relations each attain transformation, free from the illness of karmic roots and stagnant obstructions.

The Four Pures pacify the tranquil. The Four Pures are the four qi illuminating clarity. When Heaven and Earth divided, the four directions expanded—this illustrates how one’s ancestors and stagnant perceptions all attain transformation, free from calamitous entanglements. Thus, the four directions are fully guarded, and one dwells in effortless serenity, ascending to Heaven, where joy and freedom abide.

The Supreme One of the Upper Radiance gathers the multitudes and seizes the mists. The Great Cavern’s Imperial Honored One is named the Supreme One. Riding the dragon chariot of the mysterious radiance, he summons spirits and captures winds to deliver suffering souls, akin to the gathering of numinous winds and mists. A long covenant aligns with a single destiny; seven generations find repose. Through enduring harmony with auspicious fortune—akin to the assembly of kindred spirits in propitious times—seven generations of ancestors all attain rest, and all dispersed gatherings are delivered to transcendence.

Entrusting the numinous and binding fate, the blossom returns to spontaneity. Every spark of numinous light finds its lodging, and the original destiny of one’s life has its proper affiliation. Restored to radiant splendor without loss or deficit, free from toil or expenditure—hence it is called spontaneous.

Vast and boundless, luminous brilliance flows; the Six Luminaries sink and shift. *Vast and boundless* describes the far-reaching, while *luminous brilliance* signifies the flowing radiance suffusing the entire body. The Six Luminaries govern the registers of life under the Southern Dipper. When the six palaces congeal and stabilize, no further change or shift occurs.

Ascending the Brahma and steering the radiance, the Western Florescence manifests peace. The Jade Emperor’s name is Feng Lingfan, styled Lü Changling, also called the Divine Elder White Emperor, named Zhang An, styled Xihua—representing the harmony of the human lung and viscera. Together inscribed in the imperial records, all roots are untangled. The Western Florescence Jade Numinous Jasper Palace compiles the azure jade registers to present to the Jade Emperor. Through cultivation, the roots of evil, earthly bonds, demonic registers, and ghostly ledgers are all dissolved.

The womb-field’s profound path gives rise to jade orchids through the ages. The upper field is the Muddy Pellet, the middle field the Crimson Palace, and the lower field the Sea of Qi—where embryonic breathing resides. The path is deep and secluded. The Yellow Court revolves, embracing the purple and enveloping the yellow to enter the cinnabar field. Generation after generation, jade-like orchids flourish, as in the *Chapter on Generating the Divine*: "Radiant jade blossoms" conveys the same meaning. If one can nurture the lower field, the essence pervades the body like jade steps adorned with orchids. *Orchid* signifies purity and fragrance, as the *Yellow Court* states: "The body generates luminous splendor, its fragrant qi like orchids." Below, *Qiu Lan* and *Su Lan* share this meaning.

The numinous light’s eightfold radiance blends to generate the myriad spirits. One’s own spark of numinous light illuminates the eight chambers—what is called the eight windows, exquisitely open. If a person’s desire for life lacks the full complement of the myriad qi, the myriad spirits will not be complete, and life will not come to be.

The above jade passage in celestial script comprises eighty-eight characters, serving as the preface to the thirty-six chapters. The thirty-six celestial and terrestrial deities all encompass this chapter. The *Mysterious Covenant* states: "When one cultivates the Great Cavern’s Supreme Mystery Imperial One’s Cavern Chapter and recites it once, all sins are dissolved. The body’s spirits and six roots all attain cavernous purity. The Six Heavens descend in submission, the host of demons bind their heads, and the myriad qi align in rectitude, gaining the Gate of Unobstructedness."

The Primordial Celestial Sovereign said: "The first jade passage of the Great Cavern of Wenchang generates the embryo in a month, and the golden elixir returns once. *Ding-chou, Wu-yin, Yu, Sui.*" The inception flourishes in the primordial qi, its color azure, forming the Nine Yangs’ Wood Qi of the East. It congeals into celestial realms, named the Boundless Heaven of Yudan, with the kalpa called Dragon Han. This heaven’s essence and soul open the Yang Qi, governing the Muddy Pellet Palace. The imperial true womb-life’s original unity arises from the Yellow Evolution Qi, generating the embryo’s origin.

The Highest Feasts in the Purple Clarity. The *Wenchang Scripture* formerly placed this chapter first. Verified against the *Mysterious Covenant* and the scripture’s character count, they align—hence this arrangement is followed. One version of the *Supreme Clarity Great Cavern* begins with *Eastern Florescence Initiates Embryonic Radiance*. Moreover, the ten chapters of the middle volume in various editions have been interchanged. Here, the six roots are ordered sequentially, and the upper volume’s *Chapter on the Body Generating the Divine* is arranged according to the reception of womb and embryonic qi, offering readers a coherent progression.

Yet this treasured passage is not solely for those receiving life. For the practitioner refining the inner golden elixir, it must also be followed month by month in sequence, like a woman with child or a hen brooding eggs—devoted, cherishing, and unwavering in mindfulness. From the initial commencement to the tenth month, the sacred embryo completes, and the yang spirit suddenly appears. Both paths share the same track.

The generation of the human embryonic origin: the *Book of Changes* states, "When male and female unite their essences, the myriad things transform and generate." Father’s essence and mother’s blood, through empty resonance, form the Supreme Mystery’s qi born of the Supreme Nonbeing. Heaven One generates Water as its root. First arises the Ren Water of the northwest, uniting with the Ding Fire of the southwest—termed the Water-Fire mutual completion. Yin and yang resonate, meeting in the primordial palace, suspended and attached to the spleen. The spleen belongs to Earth, so all things naturally transform and generate through Earth, thereby forming the embryo. Thus, Water and Earth share the embryo in *Ji*. *Ji* is the domain of six pure yangs, belonging to Qian and Xun—this is where the Returning Wind’s Primal Union occurs. Males revolve left for ten months to *Yin*, where the Three Yangs intersect in harmony, hence males are born. Females revolve right for ten months to *Shen*, where the Three Yins fully attain closure, hence females are born.

The *Highest Feasts in the Purple Clarity*: the Highest Supreme’s Great Existence Jade Clarity Palace, where the Primordial Commencement resides, lies in the Purple Clarity Heaven. The Primordial Commencement roams and feasts above it. The Qian’s inception qi generates the human Muddy Pellet Palace in sequence. At birth, the nose forms first, hence ears form later—hence the ancient saying, "Nose ancestors, ear descendants," marking the beginning and end of human generation. The nose connects to the forehead, so the inception qi first generates the Muddy Pellet. Next, the mysterious and original two qi generate the middle and lower regions. Human life arises from yin and yang’s two flourishings and the Five Phases. Those receiving clear and luminous qi become sages and worthies; those receiving heavy and turbid qi become common folk; those receiving mixed qi become the myriad things. Thus, below it states *Five Elders Assist the Jade Root*, referring to the division of qi, as in the Nine Qi of the East.

The assistance of the Jade Root and the planting of the Jade Root within the Five Viscera both involve the scattering of crimson blossoms and the flight of jade pairs, all through the descent of true qi from the Five Directions, thereby forming the formless spirits of humanity.

The Five Elders assist the Jade Root.
The so-called *Four Mysteries Receive the Original Prohibition* ensures the long preservation of the Five Emperors’ City. The Five Viscera serve as the root of the body, guarded by the Five Spirits—hence the assistance of the Jade Root. The Five Sons return to the root: from *renzi* Wood to *gengshen*, nine in number, constituting the Nine Qi of the East; from *wuzi* Fire to *gengyin*, three in number, the Three Qi of the South; from *jiazi* Metal to *gengwu*, seven in number, the Seven Qi of the West; from *bingzi* Water to *gengchen*, five in number, the Five Qi of the North. *Gengzi* Earth resides at the Center, forming the One Qi.

The Azure Numinous Beginning Elder, Lord of the Nine Qi of the East;
The Cinnabar Numinous True Elder, Lord of the Three Qi of the South;
The Radiant Numinous August Elder, Lord of the Seven Qi of the West;
The Dark Numinous Mystic Elder, Lord of the Five Qi of the North;
The Primordial Numinous Primordial Elder, Lord of the One Qi of the Center—
all assist the Jade Root, signifying the return of the qi of the Five Viscera to their root to restore destiny. The essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intention are the roots of the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.

The Supreme Simplicity brushes past the distant radiance.
The Supreme Simplicity is the Mother of the Three Simplicities, whose spirit sweeps beyond the farthest light. *Miao* means small or complete, as seen in the infusion of the Three Floral Qi. The Supreme Simplicity is the wondrous fruit attained according to one’s rank, bearing the title *Supreme Simplicity Pure Void Perfected*.

Align the tally before the Imperial Unity.
The Noble Scion Without Peer, named *He Fu*, presents the tally he holds to align it before the Imperial Unity. Once the tally’s tokens match, rebirth is assured. *He Fu* is also called *Mysterious Origin Uncle*, who guards the gate of the liver.

The White Emperor’s luminous radiance shines.
The Venerable White Prime Spirit, whose luminous radiance shines, governs the lung qi of the West. Also named *White Prime Cavern Yang Lord*, his numinous banner bears the style *Mysterious Yi Absolute*. With the Seven Yang Metal Qi of the West, he presides over *shen* and *you*, ruling the *Dui* Palace below to guard the lungs.

Return to the Great Auroral Realm of Metal.
As the lung qi pertains to Metal, the revolving winds merge into the Great Auroral Realm. Above lies the Great White Metal Star and the Seven Mansions of the West, weaving the celestial patterns; below, it governs the Western Marchmount, its terrestrial correspondences linking to the human lung and viscera to infuse true qi.

Cross my gate of death and seal it.
Having traversed the gate of life, one must block the gate of death. The human body contains thirty-six gates of life and thirty-six gates of death. Auspicious clouds open the gates of life, while propitious mists seal the gates of death—propitious mists being true qi.

Draw forth the beam across the Three Paths.
To escape the bitter sea of the Three Paths, one must erect the bridge of the Mystic Ford. To pass the Three Passes, one must build the Magpie Bridge. As the ancients said: "Above the Magpie Bridge, below the Magpie Bridge, heaven responds to the heart, earth to the tide"—distinct from the Flying Mystic Beam.

The Ten Penetrations arise from this.
The Six Perfections and Ten Penetrations perfect the myriad practices, thereby attaining the Dao of longevity and enduring vision. Human gestation completes in ten months, with all spirits embodied before birth. Only when this fetal root is firm does one achieve the Ten Penetrations.

Wondrous practices flourish from this.
The Three Thousand Wondrous Practices thus flourish, perfectly fulfilled. Once the human spirit and qi are distributed, at an auspicious hour and propitious moment, the Dao of Golden Elixir arises. Cultivating the Ten Great Cavern Wondrous Practices, one may realize the Ten Great Wondrous Fruits.

Within the luminous radiance of the Cavern’s clarity,
In the realm of the Solar Dao, the radiance is extraordinary. Only when one’s substance is bathed in the Great Yang does one perceive the luminous realm. Floral radiance and luminous radiance are one. The ancient immortals said: "The gentle lead crucible’s light pierces the curtains"—this is the clarity of luminous radiance within the Cavern.

The Imperial Unity is truly mysterious and profound.
The Imperial Unity is the name of the Great Cavern’s Imperial Honored One. Those who refine the Golden Elixir also realize this fruit—how could it not be mysterious in the extreme? The scriptures speak of the Imperial Unity, the Male Unity, and the Female Unity, known as the *Scripture of the Three Unities*. The Imperial Unity pertains to the Water number of the North, while *xuan* (mysterious) is the color-symbol of the North. Thus, the true essence of the Male and Female Imperial Unity reaches the utmost profundity.

Of old, Master Liu Gen traveled through the four directions in official service, governing with virtue. He constantly cultivated the Dao of the Great Cavern’s Imperial Unity and thereby attained mysterious transformation into immortality.

In general, the Dao of Heaven flows and nurtures the myriad things. That which enables creation and transformation is none other than yin and yang and the Five Phases. Nothing exists without first possessing this principle, and only then does it possess this qi. When generating beings, it must rely on the gathering of this qi before there can be form. Thus, the birth of humans and things must first obtain this principle, and only then do they possess the natures of strength and compliance, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. They must obtain this qi before they can have souls, spirits, the Five Viscera, and the hundred bones. As Master Zhou said: "The true of the Non-Ultimate and the essence of the Two and Five wondrously unite and congeal." Humans receive qi in the first month, forming the embryo, and by the tenth month, the spirit is distributed and the qi is complete before birth. The Dao of refining the Golden Elixir follows this pattern precisely. After three hundred merits are perfected, the sacred embryo is firmly established.

The above Jade Chapter in celestial seal script comprises sixty characters. Above, it governs the Supreme August Yellow-Perfected Heaven; below, it rules the First Layer of the Lustrous Earth, the Earth Sovereign Lord.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: "When the disciple recites the *Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals* and cultivates the true Dao of the Imperial Unity, the wondrous practices are fully accomplished, and one first realizes the sacred merit of the Ten Penetrations. Initially, one accumulates profound and abstruse mysterious principles. Reciting it a hundred times naturally unites the qi; reciting it a thousand times without cease unites the spirit and the numinous."

The Orthodox Unity teachings include the self-designation *Minor Disciple Perfected, Your Subject So-and-So*. Thus, in the *Mysterious Contract*, whenever *disciple* is mentioned, it refers to the self-designation of the Perfected.

The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning said: "The second Jade Chapter of the *Wenchang Great Cavern*, the second month of gestation, the second return of the Golden Elixir. *Jimao*, *Gengchen*, *Gu*, *Lin*."

The primordial qi generates the Cavern qi, its color crimson, forming the Three Yangs’ fire-qi of the southern direction. Condensing into celestial realms, it is named the Supreme Meditation Virtue Immeasurable Longevity Heaven, its kalpa called Crimson Clarity. This heaven’s essence-spirit is the yang luminosity of qi, governing the Hall of Light Bureau. The Imperial Perfected’s embryonic destiny arises from the Cavern of Luminous Primordiality, where the Purple Portal’s qi engenders the root of gestation.

The Jade Void accords with the mysterious return—this is the sign of gestation in the second month. First, the Supreme Unity’s essence-spirit, named Mysterious Return, styled Flourishing Prosperity, presides over matters of birth and nurture. The Jade Void is the Jade Thearch’s bureau. The human head possesses nine palaces—this is one among them. In the fifth chapter, the Thearch descends to ascend the Jade Void, thus revealing it as the Jade Thearch’s bureau. It is also called the Supreme Jade Void Luminous August Heavenly Worthy. The immortals’ traditions record the Jade Void Venerable Master attending the assembly of the Southern Qi Lady and Anqi Sheng, hence the Jade Void is named according to the fruition of attainment. Now, the Jade Void is the abode of the Supreme Essence-Spirit.

Celestial Morn wanders the Golden Empyrean.
Celestial Morn is the sun.

The Golden Empyrean is the Yellow Path, also called the Cloud Han. When the Jade Thearch ascends his throne, the qi of the Great Yang revolves through the void, as when the Jade Thearch rides the Vermilion Empyrean—like human yang essence suddenly congealing in the midst of emptiness.

Brightly shines the Thearch’s radiance,
As the celestial sun roams,
The Empyrean and Han gleam resplendent,
Giving birth to the Thearch’s Mysterious Radiance.
The Dragon Chariot is yet another divine name,
For when essence is ninefold,
Entering luminous brilliance,
It seeks to generate the brain’s palaces—
Thus it is said: “Mounting the radiance, it soars beyond the Empyrean.”

Reverently, you ride the Jade Isle.
The joyous one, named Everlasting Life, styled Swiftly Arising,
Surnamed Cypress Completion,
Rides the sun’s light-chariot to wander the Jade Isle—
That is, the Mysterious Isle—
To serve as the Controller of the Nine Heavens’ Embryonic Origin.
Without the descent of the life-bestowing writ,
Birth shall never come to pass.
“Swiftly” means in an instant.

On the left, the Primordial Youth is summoned.
This is the qi of the Wood Sovereign,
Hence the Azure Numinous Primordial Elder Azure Youth Lord of the East,
Also called the Lesser Youth of the Grand Tenuity,
Who, in the human body, presides on the left,
Summoning azure qi to govern the liver’s three hun-souls.
The Primordial Youth is the newly born youth.

On the right, the Everlasting Talisman is commanded.
The Everlasting Talisman is the name of the Thearch’s ministerial aide.
In the West resides the White Thearch Lord,
Whose office, in the human body, lies on the right,
Issuing commands to white qi to generate the lung’s seven po-souls.
The two spirits of yin and yang stand attendant on left and right,
Conveying and assisting the divine qi.

The Luminous Perfected shines upon the Nine Empyreans.
The Heart-Mysterious Ninefold Thearch Honorable Divine Lord,
Named Luminous Perfected,
Like the sun’s wheel blazing bright above the Nine Empyreans.
When sun and moon conjoin, it is called “illumination”;
Yin and yang unite within the midst of emptiness.
The *Elixir Canon* speaks of the meeting of the two qi upon the Yellow Path.

Three days illumine the Mysterious Array.
The Mysterious Array is the Mysterious Garden,
Located on the Kunlun Mountains in the northwest,
Also called the Northern Culmen.
The “three days” are the three qi of the South,
Where the Great Yang Thearch Lord,
With true fire,
Illumines the Mysterious Garden of the North—
Is this not the Way of Already Achieved?
As the ancients said:
“Accumulate fractions to make an inch,
Accumulate inches to make a foot,
Without cease in foot and inch,
One makes a bolt of cloth.”
When a person awakens in a single moment,
Advancing with courage and vigor,
Even to one day, two days,
Or three days,
Then the mysterious qi flows unimpeded.
As the *Tang Scripture* says:
“If daily renewed, daily renewed again,
And renewed yet again,”
Gradually washing away impurities to become a person of good fortune.

The Dry Radiance arises in tender solicitude.
(One text says “Thousand Radiance,” but this is surely an error.)
The Lesser Youth of the Grand Tenuity is named Dry Radiance Essence,
Styled Meeting the Origin Master,
Also named Tender Regard.
When water and fire achieve harmony,
Yin and yang intermingle,
And the signs of birth appear,
Thus they arise together in tender solicitude and cherishing love.

Within lies the Profound and Boundless.
The Supreme Thearch Sovereign’s essence-spirit,
Named Profound and Boundless,
Is the Supreme Unity.
This spirit governs transformation
And the essence of the embryonic sac.
The perfected person who attains this
May make it the root of the sagely embryo;
In golden elixir, it serves as the medicinal substance.

Grant me long years,
For it enables one to attain longevity and enduring vision.

The Master of Emptiness and Stillness says: The Dao is not distant—it lies within the body. All things are empty, yet the nature is not empty. If the nature is not empty, the spirit and qi abide. When qi returns to the primordial sea, longevity is boundless—this is called enduring years.

A thousand kalpas make but one cycle. Only after a thousand kalpas does a single cycle complete, revolving endlessly. In heaven, there are the years of the Brushing Stone, yet for those who suffer in hell, time is no less. The *Scripture of Salvation* forbids transmission for eighty thousand kalpas; the *Scripture of the Jade Emperor*, for forty thousand kalpas. The *Chapter on the Generation of Spirit* does not emerge unless at the opening of heaven and earth—yet when will those who suffer there find liberation? Only then will they awaken to the true cause. Upon seeing this scripture, one should awaken early to attain the joy of a thousand kalpas’ enduring years. This scripture is not to be transmitted recklessly; the responsibility of transmission is shared by all.

The Yellow Register preserves the kalpa’s measure. (The character *rèn* is commonly written as *chū*, meaning "beginning." A depth of seven feet is called a *rèn*. The *Book of Documents* says, "To build a mountain nine *rèn* high"; Mencius says, "To dig a well nine *rèn* deep.") The Radiant Yellow Register can preserve and restrain the kalpa’s destiny. Once a person receives life, their name is inscribed in the Yellow Register above. The scripture says: "The Yellow Register and white tablets erase death and promote life." The true lords of heaven and earth rejoice upon hearing of a person’s birth, for the Yellow Register records their name as an auspicious sign. Yet how lamentable that people willingly abandon life to enter the realm of death! *Rèn* means "high," "pointed," or "utmost"—when the kalpa’s reckoning nears its end, the Yellow Register preserves it.

Don the brocade and enter the Spirit Mound. *Qiū* means "hollow," "great," or "gathering." It lies southeast of Kunlun, high on all four sides and low in the center, hence called Kun Mound. In humans, it is called the Spirit Mound, the Celestial Valley, or sometimes the Jade Pillow. It speaks of the Profound and Boundless donning brocade robes to enter the imperial court—this is the qi of yin and yang ascending to the brain’s gate. The *Lower Alley* says: "Grand Unity, *Chóu Qiū*, and *Lán* share the same meaning." *Jǐn* refers to the intermingling of five colors—here, the qi of the five viscera steams and dyes the pattern, called brocade robes, or embroidered robes. These are the garments worn by the Perfected Lords of Execution, who wield axes and halberds to carry out punishments.

The Grand Unity governs the root of life. This chapter is titled "The Chapter of the Grand Unity, the Venerable Spirit." The Grand Unity is the essence-qi of primordial water. Before heaven and earth took form, Heavenly One generated water—this spirit presides over it. The spirit is the master of long life. Within the human body, it resembles an infant, unclothed, four inches in length. It is the spirit of the Great Cavern’s returned embryo, the first form—named *Wùyóu* and styled *Guī Huìchāng*. It constantly guards beneath the Jade Pillow. At the moment of a person’s birth, it holds the tally and unites the hundred spirits, solely governing the root of life. Below, the term "Grand Unity" appears ten times; the details are explained in the middle fascicle’s annotations.

The Noble Scion summons and unites the tally. On the left is the Peerless Noble Scion, named *Xuán Yuánshū* and styled *Héfúzi*. The Grand Unity summons him, and when their tally tokens align, it is called true qi, which can generate life. If they do not align, it is called deviant qi and must be rejected.

Ten cycles refine the initial resolve. This refers to the *Scripture of Salvation*’s ten revolutions—ten cycles to save beings. "Initial resolve" denotes the moment of hesitation, between belief and doubt, existence and nonexistence. Thus, ten cycles complete the count, reaching the stage of non-retreat. The *Tradition* says: "If others can do it once, I will do it a hundred times; if others can do it a hundred times, I will do it a thousand." If one truly pursues this Dao, though soft, they may overcome the strong. If one tests the initial resolve with ten cycles, this Dao will be achieved. It urges people to exert utmost effort, advancing without retreat. Those who wish to turn their minds toward the supreme Dao should face the lofty Perfected and exalted Sages, making great vows and firming their initial resolve.

Attain entry into the root of great faith. Through the *Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals*’ guidance and transformation, one may enter the great stability of faith—the root of truth without delusion, the meaning of "faith" as non-opposition to things. Faith pertains to earth, and earth’s completion number is ten—also the number of the *River Chart*. This fascicle’s ten chapters include ten cycles, ten virtues, ten directions, ten flowers, ten powers, ten immortals, ten Perfected, and ten penetrations, all spoken of in full measure. Lacking even one, the Dao of generation and transformation cannot be complete. Ten is the number of earth, illustrating earth’s power to nurture and transform. Faith is simply sincerity—thus, sincerity and faith are the root.

The above jade script of celestial seal comprises ninety characters. Above, it governs the Grand Clarity Jade Perfection Heaven; below, it commands the First Rampart’s Primordial Virtue Lord. The *Mysterious Contract* says: "Reciting it twice, one enters the root of nature. Good causes do not cease; the immortal register records the name. The ten thousand qi harmonize, and one attains the gate of settled contemplation."

The Primordial Heavenly King says: "The third jade script of the Great Cavern’s *Luminous Writ* corresponds to the third month’s animating soul, three returns to one reversal." *Xīnsì*, *rénwǔ*, *guān*, *shìkè*.

The Cavern qi generates the vast qi—its color is white, belonging to the seven yang metal qi of the west. It congeals into the celestial realm, called the Brahma Canopy Prolonged Extension Heaven, with the kalpa named Prolonged Prosperity. This heaven’s essence-spirit is the qi of incipient yang, governing the upper cinnabar field palace. The imperial spirit’s animating soul and life’s primordial long numinous luminous immortal qi generate the three souls.

The Jade Emperor’s Mystic Upper Banner. (One text says: "The Jade Emperor has a Mystic Upper Banner to command the nine heavens’ steps." The phrase "many" is likely an interpolation. Generally, spirit writings and jade scripts often condense meaning into one or two or three characters per line. For example, the four characters *dǎn lǒu ā huì* convey vast meaning, just as the phrase *gāo shàng dòng yuán* encapsulates several characters’ worth. The chapters are composed in five-character lines—how could three extra characters be added? This must be a transmission error.) The Grand Tenuity Jade Emperor possesses the Yellow Return Banner and the Numinous Banner as instruments of summoning, to return the yang soul to the body.

The banners command the nine heavens’ steps. These banners, issuing commands from the nine heavens’ steps, cannot ascend by mere staging—hence their summons is made by banner, so exalted is their dignity. The "heavenly steps" denote rank and order, forbidding reckless advancement.

The Seven Awakenings ride the wondrous Dao.
The Awakened is the Buddha’s perfect awakened wondrous mind. In heaven, it is the seven stars; it spreads qi among humans, called the heart. Descending spirit into its midst, it is named the numen. It oversees the office of the Seven Awakening Spirit Kings. The Seven Awakenings are the heart of human innate ability and innate knowledge. The heart has seven apertures, hence the Seven Awakenings. It is said to ride the power of the Great Dao, striking names from the ledgers of death and inscribing them in the registers of life. The Seven Awakenings appear thrice: "Together they fly as the Seven Awakening Primes," "The Supreme Harmony conveys the Seven Awakenings," for when humans awaken, they do good; when unawakened, they become instruments of misfortune. (The Seven Awakenings are also recorded elsewhere.)

Joyous radiance returns the numinous wind.
"Joy" is felicity, "radiance" is brightness. When the qi within the human body is in supreme harmony and concord, the numinous luminosity naturally arrives. One says "numinous wind," another "spirit wind"—both are the primordial spirit’s return, blending with the wind.

The whirlwind blazes, halting in the north’s splendor.
"Whirlwind" is commonly written as *biāo*; a scorching gale arrives violently. It is also called *jùyàn fúyáo*, the cyclone, or the solar soul named "halting." "Halting" refers to pavilions and towers; originally the character *tíng* (pavilion), later written as *tíng* (to halt, to gather).

The Purple Essence sings at the eastern bend.
The long numinous luminous immortal qi generates the three souls, like a good sprout growing. The Purple Essence flourishes in the eastern land of benevolent virtue. The blazing whirlwind and Purple Essence—these two spirits chant the precious chapters of the Great Cavern, their songs ascending to the nine heavens.

Jade harmony resounds beyond the nine skies.
The Left Immortal of the Orthodox Unity is named Jade Harmony, like jade chimes ringing, their sound piercing beyond the nine skies. As the *Analects* says: "Heaven will use the Master as a wooden clapper." Between heaven and humanity, harmonious qi brings auspiciousness, and all desire the overflowing of virtuous governance.

The jade tally summons the Grand Tenuity.
The Jade Emperor summons the Grand Tenuity’s youth named Dry Radiance, commanding him to stand at his side. He orders him to wield the Yellow Return Banner, while the Non-Male commands the Numinous Banner to summon the hidden souls. The *Chapter on Generating Spirit* says: "The Grand Tenuity’s Yellow Return Banner."

The Three Pures generate the Mud Pill Palace.
"Pure" means unadulterated. The Three Pures are purity without end. The Mud Pill Palace: the head has nine palaces. Between the brows, one *cun* inward, is the Hall of Light Palace, where the Grand One resides. To the left is the Purple Chamber, to the right the Vermilion Door. One *cun* further inward is the Cavern Chamber Palace, where three perfected ones dwell: to the left, the Non-Male; to the right, the White Prime; and in the center, the Yellow Cloud. Three *cun* inward is the Mud Pill Palace, the place of ingress and egress for the ten thousand spirits. The Three Pure Lords, named Han Zhang, preside over this palace. Four *cun* inward is the Flowing Pearl Palace, five *cun* the Jade Emperor Palace. One *cun* above the Hall of Light is the Heavenly Court Palace; one *cun* above the Cavern Chamber is the Ultimate Perfection Palace; one *cun* above the Cinnabar Field is the Mystic Cinnabar Palace; one *cun* above the Flowing Pearl is the Heavenly Sovereign Palace. Together, these are called the nine palaces of the head. The Three Radiant Lords of the Imperial Elder generate spirit in the Mud Pill Palace, also called the qi of the three fields: blue, yellow, and white. The *Yellow Court* says: "The Mud Pill has nodes, all with spirits." The Three Pures are also a name for cinnabar. Formerly, Master Wang refined the Three Pures Elixir and was summoned to the Central Marchmount, where he attained the Dao. Also, Duke Wu of Zhou, Lady Hui of Zhou, cultivated the Dao of the Three Pures. They encountered the Western Numinous Sage Mother, who transmitted the scriptures. Hundreds of men and women admired them. They said, "The world is in chaos; I shall depart. After a hundred years, I will return," and then transformed and departed.

The effulgence of the Golden Numen shines.
The Three Pures emit golden efflorescence, their numinous radiance illuminating above and below. Like a person whose wisdom-eye is opened, seeing all without obstruction. The eye is the canopy of the five viscera, manifesting the brightness of sun and moon. The Yellow Court’s eye spirit is the Luminous Effulgent Mystic Lord.

The Elder Lord and Han Zhang ascend.
Han Zhang is the personal name of the Three Pure Lords, the spirits who generate the Mud Pill Palace. When a person is born, qi descends from heaven, then receives the essence and blood of father and mother. At the inception of form, it begins from the Mud Pill, sequentially growing into a complete form.

Guard and defend the mechanism of death’s node.
Reciting this thrice, the three souls naturally generate. The Three Pure Lords must guard and seal the mechanism of death’s qi node, ensuring reception of life. The Lower Lane says: "Guard and seal the death qi, unfolding sameness." Han Zhang’s name means "spirit generates the Dao," his divine office.

The Ten Virtues generate within the Mystic.
The goodness of human nature can all become like Yao and Shun. There is no one who is not good, yet people themselves flow into the realm of misfortune and evil, inviting calamity and disaster.

The doctrine of karmic retribution for good and evil is sometimes dismissed as fantastical by Confucians. Yet it is also said that Wang Wei painted ghosts and spirits to frighten those who would not otherwise understand. The texts state: "Doing good brings a hundred blessings; doing evil brings a hundred calamities." The *Book of Yu* declares: "Following the Dao brings fortune; defying it brings misfortune—like shadow and echo." It also says: "Pride invites loss; humility brings gain—this is the Way of Heaven." The *Book of Changes* states: "A family that accumulates goodness will have abundant fortune; a family that accumulates evil will have abundant misfortune." Such are the earnest teachings of the sages, and the principle of karmic retribution is as clear as day. Why would the sages not speak of it? It is only that you have not yet had the leisure to study and clarify it.

When a person cultivates the Ten Virtues, they are born within the Mystic qi. Yanzi, upon attaining a single virtue, held it fast in reverence. Yu bowed upon hearing a virtuous word. For one who abides in the perfection of goodness—whether as a ruler in benevolence, a minister in respect, a child in filial piety, a parent in kindness, or in dealings with others in sincerity—every action and retreat becomes the utmost good. Thus, one naturally transcends calamity. Passing through the trials of calamity, one attains effortless spontaneity.

The scripture states: "Soaring beyond the Three Disasters and Four Destructions, one reaches the state of natural non-action, unbound by yin and yang, the Five Phases, or the six qi." This is the profound meaning of the earnest chapter.

The above Jade Chapter in celestial script comprises seventy characters. Above, it governs the Qingming River Lad of Heaven; below, it empowers the First Rampart’s Yuande Lord. The *Mystic Contract* says: "Reciting it thrice grants sovereign wisdom, transcends all calamities, enters the Upper Pass of the Mystic, and with all qi purified, enters the Gate of the Inaudible and Invisible."

*Jade Pure Ultimate Supreme Perfected Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture*, Scroll Four
Annotated by Zhongyangzi Wei Qi of Mount Penglai in Eastern Shu

The Primordial Heavenly King said: The Great Flourishing Great Cavern Jade Chapter, Fourth, generates the soul in the fourth month, cycling four returns and two reversions. *Guiwei*, *Jiashen*, *Bi*, *Bo*. The primordial qi generates the *Min* qi, its color profound black, forming the Five Yang Waters qi of the north. It congeals into a celestial realm named the Silent and Secluded *Doushu* Heaven, with its kalpa called *Kaihuang*. This heaven’s essence is the qi of the soul and the Great Yang, governing the Cavern Chamber Palace. The Emperor Perfected’s po-soul commands the primordial *Yangshi Mingyan* qi, from which the seven po-souls arise. The Supreme Perfected governs the nine qi.

The Supreme Perfected is the Great Profound One, that is, the primordial qi of the Profound and Primordial Two. ● It generates the nine qi—alternatively called the Great Profound Nine Qi. The upper and lower scrolls’ nine chapters state: "The Supreme Perfected’s Ninefold Radiant Wheel," where radiance is qi, governing the nine qi to generate the myriad spirits.

The Cavern’s luminous scene lodges numinous communion. The Cavern Yang’s abode is where perfected immortals refine the hun-souls. The Crimson Palace’s radiant scene is the dwelling where the divine luminaries lodge their traces. Those who attain communion enter and exit without constancy—Confucius grasped this: when he wielded it, it remained; when he set it aside, it vanished. They come and go without fixed time, their abode unknown.

The Jade Emperor rides the Vermilion Empyrean. The Jade Emperor Lord rides the chariot of the Vermilion Empyrean to govern and command the myriad numina. The Vermilion Empyrean, also called the Cinnabar Empyrean or Crimson Empyrean, is the name of the Upper Field’s *Niwan* [mud-pill palace]. There lies the Jade Emperor’s palace, which governs the myriad spirits of the human body and presides over the lord of the myriad qi.

Verdant radiance illumines the golden ramparts. *Yong* refers to earthen walls built of piled bricks to form a small city, or the north wall within a hall. It speaks of the Jade Emperor entering the city with majestic bearing, clad in a verdant rosy dawn sash, resplendent within the golden walls. The fifth stanza of the Central Lane states: "Adorned with vermilion kerchief and verdant radiance," conveying the same meaning.

The upper abode holds the cloud-pearl within. When [qi] ascends from the two kidneys, passing through the spine’s double gates to enter *Niwan*, only a single luminous pearl remains.

The *cloud-pearl* is the pearl of the five clouds, and the five clouds are the qi transformed from the five viscera. The cloud-pearl is thus the *Mysterious Pearl Palace*. Above, it connects to the *Peak Without Blade*. At the summit of the Jade Capital Mountain, the void is without sharp edges—this describes how the crown of the human head likewise meets the boundless, blade-less expanse of emptiness. The northwest’s Kunlun Mountain has its golden city and jade towers; the human head is the same.

Below lies the *Spirit Pass of the Great Wilderness*. The *Spirit Pass* refers to the three barriers, namely the upper, middle, and lower fields. In the profound obscurity of the vast and mysterious depths—where above there is no longer color, and below no longer abyss—this is the realm of the northern *Yin* of Fengdu, the domain of hidden darkness, situated between the two kidneys.

Misty vapors surge into the empty void. The true qi steams upward, filling the hollow expanse, speaking of the human’s utmost and most unyielding qi, which pervades beyond heaven and earth, in the boundless and infinite. *Misty vapors* refer to auspicious mists and propitious clouds; *surging* means harmony.

The obscure transformation blends *Kan* and *Li*. What humans cannot see is called the *dark and hidden*. Thus, when the qi of *Kan* (Water) and *Li* (Fire) unite, it is termed *obscure darkness*. *Transformation* refers to the merging of water and fire. The *Elixir Canon* states: *"Take the solid center from the Kan position, and direct it to the Yin within the Li palace."* Thus, water and fire are the true essence of the Dao. Fu Xi’s *precelestial* water and fire are King Wen’s *postcelestial* sun and moon—their names differ, but their reality is the same. The immortals say: *"This aperture is no ordinary aperture; it is formed by the union of Qian and Kun. It is called the Cavern of Spirit and Qi, wherein reside the essences of Kan and Li."*

The hexagram names are but a summary, for *Kan* and *Li* are the mother of the myriad things. The other hexagrams follow by extension and are all complete. For those who recite this, the six positions ascend, the body transforms into pure Yang, and refined gold is transmuted, ascending into the *Golden Gate*. The *six positions* are the six lines; when *Kun* transforms into *Qian* up to the sixth, it becomes a body of pure Yang. *Kan* and *Li* are the essentials of *Wenchang*.

The *Mysterious Mysterious* is *Fire King Shu*. The *Upper Prime’s Mysterious Father* has the hidden name *Fire King Shu* and the style *Left Revolving Light*. *Mysterious Father* is the *Father of the Dao*. Some texts say *Fire Born Shu*, but according to Chapter Fourteen of the lower scroll, it is *Fire King Shu*; the present text follows this. The character *King* comes from the *Shangqing Jade Canon*.

The *Jade Tranquility* is *High Same-Born*. The *Upper Prime’s Mysterious Mother* has the hidden name *High Same-Born* and the style *Right Revolving Light*. *Mysterious Mother* is the *Mother of the Dao*. *Jade Tranquility* is the *Gate of the Female*. Some texts say *High Same King*, but since the previous line uses *King*, this should be *Born*, guarding the *Mysterious Female Gate*.

The *Limitless* protects the *Valley Youth*. The *Spirit-Soul Lord of the Central Knot* is named *Valley Youth*. *Limitless* means *inexhaustible*; *protects* means *nurtures*. He is also called the *Yellow Tranquility Youth*. He resides in the central palace of the spleen, above the *Xu* and *Si* positions, governing the spirit that digests water and grain. Clad in yellow robes, he stands in the *Yellow Court*.

The *Round Path* knows no stagnation. One version reads *without obstruction*, but *no stagnation* is more refined. The *Round Path* is the aperture within the true. *No stagnation* means the three palaces ascend and descend, circulating without cease. When the Dao’s path is open, round brilliance arises.

The *Silken Union* has nine layers. The true qi intertwines like the patterns of silk brocade, its forces interwoven and blended, its radiance as thick as nine layers. When true immortals pay homage to the Emperor, they see only golden light ablaze, not the pure countenance. When humans cultivate the true, ghosts and spirits see only red light.

To the *south*, uproot the roots of the seven ancestors. *Uproot* may also be read as *unfurl*. *Southern seven* is fire. *Unfurl* means to brush away the dust of the seven ancestors’ roots, ensuring purity so that the nine souls may be born. The nine immortals and seven ancestors all reside within the body. When one is purified, they naturally transform and arise.

To the *west*, dissolve the misfortunes of kalpas past. The west belongs to Yin, governed by the lung’s *po*. The *po* draws human emotions and desires, leading to calamity. Without the *Great Cavern’s* dissolution, even after ten thousand kalpas of dust, there would be no liberation. Thus, one restrains the seven *po* and commands the lung’s qi.

The body is vigorous, the myriad essences wave. *Vigorous* describes strength; the body is robust, and the essence-qi is lustrous. *Vigorous* is the *jiao* of *strong and unyielding*. The *myriad essence-waves* are the true water of the north, transformed into true Yang qi, rising from the kidneys to the *Mud-Pill Palace* and dripping down to the heart.

The *Spirit King* gathers the ten directions. The *Spirit King of the Ten Directions’ Flying Heavens* is the qi of wind and life. One version says *spirit born*, which is incorrect. The *Scripture of Spirit Generation* states: *"The office of the Spirit King is no small matter, and the Jade Canon commands the Five Elders to defer to the Spirit King’s judgment—this is the office of the Jade Assistant’s High Minister."*

The *Great Return* reverts to the *Womb Chariot*. Having returned to the womb and been reborn, one’s great return follows the chariot’s tracks—no longer drifting as a floating soul. The *chariot* is named for its ceaseless circulation of true qi. *Return* means reverting to the root and source; the *womb* is the *Sacred Embryo*.

The *Threefold Union* mounts the *Celestial Dragon*. With the three transformations aligned and the three unions complete, form and spirit are perfected, and one ascends riding the dragon. The term *Celestial Dragon* has five variants: *Dragon Mountain*, *Dragon Terrace*, *Dragon Radiance*, *Dragon Gem*—all share the same meaning. The *Celestial Dragon* is the dragon ridden by the Heavenly Emperor.

The above is a jade stanza of celestial script, totaling one hundred characters. Above, it governs the *Mysterious Womb’s Peaceful Nurturing Heaven*; below, it commands the *First Rampart’s Primordial Virtue Lord*. The *Mysterious Contract* states: *"Recite it four times, and the roots of dust gradually dissolve; the net of karma unravels on its own. One no longer follows the kalpas but returns, and the myriad qi converge, attaining the gate of freedom."*

The *Primordial Heavenly King* said: *"The fifth jade stanza of the Great Cavern of Wenchang corresponds to the fifth month, which generates the five viscera and the five returns with three reversions."*

*Yiyou*, *Bingxu*, *Fu*, *Wuwang*—the *Min Qi* generates the *Jing Qi*. Its color is yellow, the central single Yang’s ascending qi, congealing into the celestial realm called *Paranirmita-vaśavartin*, the *Heaven of Unsurpassed Joy*. Its kalpa is named *Upper August*. This heaven’s essence is the *Upper Yang Qi of the Spirit-Soul*, governing the *Crimson Palace’s* true viscera and the life’s origin, the *Central Spirit Qi* among the five immortals that generates the five viscera.

The *Palace of the Supreme Subtlety Heavenly Emperor* resides within the *Great Ultimate*, and within the *Supreme Subtlety* are the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones, who specialize in descending spirits, deploying qi, and nurturing life. Those who suffer miscarriage or infertility do so because the *qi of the Supreme Subtlety* fails to connect, making sustenance difficult.

The *Eight Floating* enter the *Cloud Encampment*. The *eight consciousnesses* soar and drift, entering the encampment of the *Five Clouds*—the *Five Clouds* being the five viscera, each with its golden chambers and jade halls, hence called an "encampment." The scripture states: *"Flowing echoes in the cloud encampment,"* speaking of the qi circulating through the five viscera, forming a symphony of music.

The *Spiritual Ancestor* governs the *Numinous Lapel*. The *Central Elder*, named *Spiritual Ancestor*, is the ruler of the heart, meaning the spirit’s ancestral lord orders the numinous terrace of the breast. The five spirits take the heart-spirit as their master, while the other four spirits descend in sequence to generate the five viscera and deploy the five spirits.

*Dragon Mountain* flourishes in the *Jade Capital*. The *Dragon*, wood, resides on the left as the liver. Its spirit is called the *Lord of No-Florescence* or the *Dragon’s Yang Essence*, unfathomable in transformation. It speaks of the human head taking form, where the Yang qi flourishes brilliantly, and the complexion becomes joyful, reaching upward to meet the *Peak Without Blade*.

The *Golden Chamber* is dense with radiant rosy clouds. The *Golden Chamber* is the lung viscera, where the spirit *White Prime Honored Spirit* resides, governed by the *Western Great Flower Prime Elder* of the Metal Flower. The Metal qi transforms into thick, luminous clouds of rosy brilliance, signifying the lung qi’s majestic power, steaming with lush and verdant splendor.

The *Nine Gates* gleam with lofty jade. The heart has seven apertures corresponding to the seven stars, and below are the two mysterious female orifices corresponding to the *Auxiliary* and *Assistant*, thus forming the *Nine Gates* of jade, luminous and lofty. It is also said that the head has seven orifices, with the lower region’s water and fire orifices completing the nine.

The *Yellow Court* traverses the *Northern Origin*. The *Central Spleen Palace*, as the *Yellow Court* states: *"The spleen’s palace belongs to Wu and Ji,"* hence called the *Yellow Court*. *"Traversing the Northern Origin"* refers to its upward connection with the heart’s orifices, possessing both inner and outer scenes of the *Yellow Court*, spanning above, below, and the four directions to attain the center.

The *Primal Father* turns left in brightness. The *Three Primes* and *Three Perfected*’s *Upper Primal Father Lord*, styled *Left-Turning Brightness*, guards the *Mysterious Female*. The *Primal Father* appears thrice: in the eighth chapter as *"The Primal Father knits the immortal embryo,"* and in the middle scroll’s tenth chapter as *"The Primal Father, Left-Turning Brightness"* (see prior annotations).

The *Vermilion Crystal* awakens the *Radiant Master*. *Vermilion Crystal* is the original name of the spirit guarding the heart’s right, the *White Prime Cavern-Yang Emperor Lord*, named *Vermilion Crystal*. It opens the light of the sun, moon, and *Three Primes*. The *Radiant Master* is also called the *White Prime Lord* or *Yang Essence*, each having two appellations.

The *Profound Solitude* ascends to the *Upper Clarity*. The *Great One* is named *Profound Solitude*. When the human kidney’s water ascends to congeal with the heart’s fire, the *Upper Field* becomes *Jade Clarity*, the *Middle Field* *Upper Clarity*, and the *Lower Field* *Great Clarity*. It is also said: *"The Emperor Sovereign Great One dwells in the profound void,"* styled *Profound Solitude*.

The *Four Mysteries* uphold the *Primal Prohibitions*. The *Four Numinous Beings*—*Azure Dragon*, *White Tiger*, *Vermilion Bird*, and *Dark Warrior*—grasp the prohibitions of the *Primal Conduct*. The *Four Heavenly Gate Kings* guard the celestial gates, preventing demons and ghosts from daring to intrude. In Daoist fasts and offerings, at dawn, there are commands to expel demons and avert misfortune, welcoming the descent of perfected ones and sages. When a person’s five viscera are complete, the *Four Numinous Beings* guard them. The *Three Unions*, *Four Mysteries*, *Five Emperors*, *Six Luminaries*, *Seven Awakenings*, *Eight Scenes*, *Nine Lights*, and *Ten Perfected* all pertain to the way of the sacred embryo’s firmness in the tenth month, the method of *leaving the furnace and changing the cauldron*—for the liver is the *Azure Dragon*, the lung the *White Tiger*, the heart the *Vermilion Bird*, and the kidney the *Dark Warrior*.

Eternally protect the *Five Emperor Cities*. The heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney are the *Five Emperor Cities*. The *Five Emperors* are: the *Azure Emperor* styled *Carved Beam’s Edge*, the *Vermilion Emperor* styled *Ever-Coming Awareness*, the *White Emperor* styled *Manifest Peace and Fortune*, the *Black Emperor* styled *Preserving Completion and Prosperity*, and the *Yellow Emperor* styled *Containing Radiance and Subtlety*.

The above jade stanza in celestial script totals sixty characters, governing above the *Primordial Luminous Writ* of the *Wenju Heaven* and commanding below the *Second Rampart’s* *Stalwart Colored Earth-Soil Sovereign*.

The *Primordial Heavenly King* said: *"The sixth jade stanza of the Great Cavern of Wenchang corresponds to the sixth month, which generates the six bowels and the six returns with four reversions."*

*Dinghai*, *Wuzi*, *Great Accumulation*, *Providence*—the *Scenic Qi* generates the *Reclusive Qi*. Its color is azure, congealing into the northeastern celestial realm called the *Heaven of Cavernous Primordial Resonance*, where the kalpa’s essence is the *Primal Yang Qi of the Spirit-Soul*, governing the *Central Cinnabar Field Palace*, the *Imperial Perfected’s* numinous mansion, and the life’s origin of the *Lofty Perfected’s* harmonious and flowing qi that generates the six bowels.

The *Purple Essence* resides in the *Great Void’s* center. The *Purple Essence Heaven* lies within the *Great Void’s* empty cavern, the colorless celestial realm where the *Three Clarities* reside. In humans, this corresponds to the *Heavenly Valley*, the gathering place of the myriad spirits, also called the *Great Void*—formless and imageless.

The *Three Origins* ascend the *Upper Scenic Way*. The *Three Origins* are the *Chaotic Great Void Origin*, the *Vermilion Chaotic Great Void Origin*, and the *Profound Stillness Mysterious Penetration Origin*. The three qi ascend the *Upper Scenic Way*, speaking of the human qi circulating endlessly through the upper, middle, and lower fields, returning to the *Mud-Pill Palace*.

The *Great Treasure* shines with luminous brilliance. The *Great Treasure* is the *Jade Emperor’s* throne, pure and radiant. It speaks of the human *Mysterious Pearl’s* resplendence, the *Azure Fox’s* millet-grain pearl, all called the *Great Treasure*. The *Heavenly Perfected* are noble and weighty, possessing radiant brilliance, hence called the *Great Treasure*.

The *Luminous* fans the *Emperor’s* spread. One version says *"Vast and distant,"* while *"Luminous"* means manifest. *"Fanning"* refers to the *Jade Emperor* ascending the *Great Treasure*, where his pure light and majestic flames fan forth, just as in inner alchemy, where flames burst forth from the central palace.

The *Elder Scribe* awakens the *Three Primes*. The *Yellow Court’s* *Primal King of the Life Gate*, named *Elder Scribe*, is originally the *Three-One Spirit*—the *Upper One* the *Red Child*, the *Middle One* the *Primal Emperor*, and the *Lower One* the *Primal King*, also named *Original Essence* styled *Primal Yang*, or *Infant*. The *Embryo* awakens the *Three Prime Lords*.

The Emperor ascends to the Jade Void.
"Emperor" denotes the sovereign; without the myriad qi, the human body cannot nurture the myriad spirits. Yet at the center of the myriad spirits resides the Emperor-King—where the heart directs, the myriad spirits obey. "Ascending the Jade Void" refers to the upper Mud-Pill Palace, the Gate of the Brain.

Auspicious qi nurtures the Five Clouds.
Five-colored auspicious clouds and propitious mists surround and uphold the Jade Emperor. East with three, South with two together make five; North with one, West with four share in them. Five is the generative number of wu-ji, where the Three Families meet to form the Embryo-Brother. The Five Clouds are also called the Five Spirits.

The Deity of Destiny commands the luminous inception.
The Deity of Destiny governs the Palace of the Heart, named *Li Mingchu*. The heart-palace is the abode of luminous spirits; "inception" signifies the first shaping, referring to the heart-viscus. From its emptiness arises awareness, and upon it depends the span of human life—hence it is called the Deity of Destiny.

The Ten Radiant Flowers perfect the immortal’s wondrous practice.
The ten directions’ radiant splendor, their wondrous practice perfected, attest to the attainment of immortality. The Ten Radiant Flowers are: Azure Flower, Cinnabar Flower, Plain Flower, Mysterious Flower, Yellow Flower, Jade Flower, Golden Flower, Green Flower, Jasper Flower, and Jadeite Flower—together comprising the wondrous practice of the Ten Flowers.

Subduing demons gives rise to the Six Luminances.
The Six Luminances are the six roots. In humans, they first generate the five viscera, then the six bowels. The free flow between viscera and bowels becomes the mansion of the Six Luminances. The six bowels are: gallbladder, stomach, bladder, large intestine, small intestine, and navel—collectively termed the Six Bowels.

The above Jade Stanza in celestial script comprises fifty characters, governing above the *Upper Radiance* of the *Seven Luminaries* and *Māyā Heaven*, and ruling below the *Second Rampart* of the *August Virtue Lord*.
The *Mysterious Concord* states: Reciting it six times severs forever the demonic blades of the Six Heavens, purifies the six roots with vast clarity, and engenders the myriad qi to shine in unison—whereupon one transcends the world and enters the Gate of Immortality.

The Primordial Heavenly King declares: The *Great Cavern Jade Stanza, Seventh Chapter*, opens the seven apertures of the heart in the seventh month, achieving the Seven Returns and Five Reversions.
*Ji-chou*, *Great Exceedance*, *Kǎn*.
*Kǎn* and *lí* bear no branches or stems.
Mysterious qi generates harmonious qi, its color black, congealing to form the northwestern celestial realm, named *Linghua Brahmā-Assistant Heaven*. This heaven’s essence-spirit is the qi of true yang, presiding over the *Primal Valley Palace*. The *Imperial Perfected* of the *Primal Mansion* and the *High Immortals* of the *Cavern-Script* open the seven apertures of the heart.

The True Yang Emperor receives the Elder Guest.
The *Rites* state: The Son of Heaven bares his arm to carve the sacrificial beast, kneeling to present the spoon.

Awaiting the Rites of the Three Elders—what is called "nurturing the aged and entreating their counsel." Now the True Yang serves as the Jade Emperor’s Elder Guest, also named the Left Immortal of the *Zhengyi*, whose personal name is *Binlao*, and who is further styled *Zhongchengzi*. He receives his duties in the assembly of the Jade Sovereign. Each gathering convenes at the *Jade Void*, where he receives the Jade Emperor’s affairs, just as the True Yang makes its audience at the *Muddy Pellet of Nine*—this is called the "silent audience before the Supreme Emperor." The method employs the *Purple River Chariot*, transporting it from the *Weilü* into the brain; after twelve years, one attains immortality.

It extinguishes demons and purges the foul corpse,
subduing the demon kings and vanquishing their treachery,
eradicating the heads of malevolent spirits,
and expelling the impure qi of corpses and blood.
Once yang qi arises, yin qi naturally dissipates—such is the principle.

Demons are the trials by which the Emperor-Kings of all heavens test whether the human heart is steadfast. The hundred bureaus proceed to the *Crimson Palace*. The human *Dantian Palace* is called the *Crimson Palace*, which is the heart’s residence. The spirits of the hundred meridians constantly attend this palace to receive commands, for the heart is the lord of the myriad spirits. All spirits pay audience to their sovereign, and the principles of the myriad affairs and things reside therein.

The *Leisurely Abode* lies within the *Cinnabar Mystery*,
the dwelling of ease within the *Dantian*,
one inch above which is the *Mystery-Cinnabar Palace* in the head.
There, the primordial spirit gathers and congeals the myriad qi,
ascending to return to the *Leisurely Abode* of the *Mystery-Cinnabar Palace*,
the gate for refining and practicing the yang spirit’s ingress and egress.

The five qi bind the ten directions:
the qi of the five directions—
nine qi in the east,
three qi in the south,
seven qi in the west,
five qi in the north,
and one qi in the center—
flow like the qi of the five viscera,
circulating throughout the body’s interior and exterior, reaching everywhere without exception.

The *Seven Revolutions* summon the *Controller of Destiny*;
when the *Seven Returns and Nine Reversions* are complete, the Dao of the elixir is achieved.
The arrival of the *Controller of Destiny* signifies the perfection of the Way of longevity and enduring vision.
The *Controller of Destiny* is the spirit of the heart, also called the *Seven Revolutions Summoning the Controller of Destiny*.
The *Seven Revolutions* occur when the seven yang metal qi encounter fire to form the elixir.

The *Three Returns* summon the *Immortal Duke*.
The *Three Harmonies* form the sound that summons the *Immortal Duke*,
one of the five ranks of immortals—*Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount, and Baron*—
such as the *Supreme Ultimate Immortal Duke*.
Now, the *Immortal Duke* is the *Eastern Florescence Wood Palace*, overseer of the liver.

The *Lord of Mount Tai* governs ghosts,
the *Lord of Mount Tai* presides over the affairs of ghosts and spirits—
this is the *Sacred Emperor of the Eastern Peak*.
*Tai* is *Great*; the mountain lies in Yanzhou,
foremost of the Five Marchmounts, thus called *Daizong*,
belonging to the east’s wood, the realm of generation and transformation.

Hasten to audit the records of the Three Officials’ midst.
The Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water audit the registers of life and death, sin and fortune in their palaces.
"Hasten" means swiftness without haste.
The Three Primordial Officials’ bureaus number one hundred twenty,
convening thrice yearly—on the first, seventh, and tenth months—to conduct their impeccable audits.

The ten virtues lay the initial foundation.
The *Ten Virtues* correspond to the central earth’s number, governing the spleen and stomach’s grain qi to generate fluids.
The *Ten Virtues* form the foundation of perfect fortune:
the rooster possesses five virtues, humans ten, and all things at least one.
Human luminous virtue is bestowed by heaven,
endowed in all beings without deficit or excess.
Yet the passions and desires obscure it, leading to benightedness.
Thus, the *Primordial Beginning* desires that humans cultivate this Way,
rooting the perfection of virtue—this is called "knowing the origin lies in illuminating luminous virtue."
The *Ten Virtues* are recorded in the eighth chapter of the *Mystery Contract* in the *Lower Lane*; here, they are not reiterated.

Together, they ascend with the *Seven Awakening Primes*.
Awakening leads to perfect enlightenment; failure to awaken leaves one a common mortal.
The *Seven Awakenings* are the heart,
whose spirit ascends to communicate through the seven apertures—eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.
Thus, the seven apertures open to keen perception,
the seven stars shine brightly,
and the adept ascends with them into the *Seven Primes* of the Dipper.

The *Seven Awakenings* are the *Conscious Spirit*:
first, innate knowledge;
second, knowledge enabling perception;
third, perception enabling compliance;
fourth, compliance enabling practice;
fifth, practice enabling steadfastness;
sixth, steadfastness enabling accomplishment;
seventh, accomplishment without attachment—
these are the *Seven Awakenings*.
One who can practice them advances to sublime conduct and attains the rank of flying immortal.

These jade-script celestial seal characters, sixty in number, govern above the Void Transcending Heng Heaven and command below the Second Rampart of the August Virtue Lord.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: Recite them seven times, and the Seven Prime Dipper Consorts descend to erase the adept’s name from the ledgers of death, transferring it to the Southern Palace. The ten thousand qi ascend in unison, and one enters the Gate of Flying Immortals.

The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning declares: This is the Eighth Jade Chapter of the Great Cavern of Wenchang. In the eighth month, the Eight Radiant Spirits generate the divine, and the human returns through six reversions. Gengyin, Li, Xian. Fused qi generates flaming qi, its color cinnabar, congealing into the southeastern celestial realm called High Void Luminous Heaven. This heaven’s essence-spirit communicates the yang qi, presiding over the Palace of Ultimate Yin. The Imperial Perfected of the Hua Mansion commands the primordial numinous-transformative qi to generate the Three Divisions and Eight Radiant Spirits.

The Three Primes of Primordial Simplicity—these Three Primes are the Three Divisions. Each division has eight nodes, also called the Three Primes, namely the spirit, qi, and essence. The Three Simplicities of the Primordial Mother are the feminine unity’s spirit, gathering in the Lower Prime at midnight, the Middle Prime at noon, and the Upper Prime at dusk, ascending and descending through the Three Palaces.

At dawn, ascend the Hall of Vast Spirit. The Hall of Vast Spirit is the heart’s mansion. At the first cock’s crow, ascend to the Crimson Palace, for the yang qi is newly born. The Three Simplicities of the Primordial Mother are also the spirits who impeach and report sins and blessings, presenting the worldly person’s transgressions. Thus, recite the scripture at early dawn to repel them.

The Jade Capital manifests the mysterious register. The Jade Capital Mountain is where the registers of all immortals reside. Those who cultivate the Dao should, at the midnight hour when the first yang stirs, sit in stillness to calm the heart, pay homage to the ten thousand qi, and avoid the recording of human transgressions and blessings before the Jade Emperor by the spirits who submit reports.

Guard the life-gate and preserve the Dao’s well-being. The Peach Well Lord guards the life-gate at the navel. Wang Shuhe identified the right kidney as the life-gate, for human life and death reside in the kidneys; when the kidneys fail, the life pulse ceases. One version mistakenly writes "child" for "kernel." Moreover, the peach kernel harmonizes with the flourishing radiance of life.

The revolving wind disperses the ten thousand demons. At midnight, yin and yang merge to perfect the Dao of the Imperial One. Thus, one can dispel the ten thousand demons, for yang arises as yin recedes. This is the time when the noble’s Dao grows while the petty’s Dao wanes—the Dao of revolving wind and fusion.

The golden talisman summons the Vast Realm. With the golden talisman, summon the Vast Wilderness, the realm of ultimate yin, so that the ethereal souls may all receive rebirth. One version reads "deliver the minister," which is doubtful. The Vast Realm refers to the Northern Yin Fengdu. The kidney division pertains to water, and metal generates water.

Assist and protect the earthly gate within. Guard and support the earthly gate, storing the generative qi in the lower field. As the *Book* says: "Attend to the bright mandate of Heaven." The earthly gate is the life-gate of the lower division. Cherish and protect it; do not corrupt it with lust and desire.

Preserve this King of Longevity. In heaven, there is the Jade Pure Perfected King, the Great Emperor of Longevity, who exclusively holds the power of generation and transformation. Within the human, preserve and guard the King of My Longevity and Deathlessness—this is the indestructible primordial spirit through eons, the root of the sacred embryo.

Turn and enter the Ten Immortal Gates. The Gates of Wondrous Observation—there are ten kinds of immortal gates: the Unobstructed Gate, the Gate of Concentrated Contemplation, the Gate of Myriad Wonders, the Gate of Subtlety and Silence, the Gate of Self-Mastery, the Gate of Longevity, the Gate of Immortal Advancement, the Gate of Flying Immortals, the Gate of Flying Spirits, and the Gate of Perfected Ascent.

The Eight Radiant Spirits unite in the Cavern Yang. The Eight Radiant Spirits and Eight Gates are all portals within the body through which the spirit and qi exit and enter. It is also said: The Three Divisions and Eight Radiant Spirits enter together the Cavern Yang Palace. The Vermilion Mound Fire Mansion refines the essence in the Jade Pupil, and the Yellow Florescence washes the form.

These jade-script celestial seal characters, fifty in number, govern above the Supreme Ultimate Veiled Heaven and command below the Second Rampart of the August Virtue Lord.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: Recite them eight times, and the Eight Radiant Spirits are born. The Eight Mighty Spirit Kings guard and protect the cultivator of the real. The eight heavens in the four directions record the immortal’s name, sever the earthly gate, and forever cut off the roots of evil. The ten thousand qi shine in unison, and one enters the Gate of Flying Spirits.

The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning declares: This is the Ninth Jade Chapter of the Great Cavern of Wenchang. In the ninth month, the Nine Houses open and communicate, and the nine return through seven reversions. Xinmao, Renchen, Heng, Dun. Flaming qi generates evolving qi, its color white, congealing into the southwestern celestial realm called the Heaven of No Thought, No Knots, No Attachment. This heaven’s essence-spirit germinates the yang qi, presiding over the Lower Cinnabar Field Palace. The Imperial Perfected of the Yue Mansion commands the primordial natural mysterious illumination qi to permeate the nine apertures.

The Purple Essence nurtures the Flourishing Forest. The term "Purple Essence" appears four times, all referring to celestial realms, though some versions contain errors; here, all are annotated. In the first chapter of the upper scroll, "Ascending the Purple Clarity in Leisure"; in the first chapter of the lower scroll, "Ascending the Purple Clarity in Ease"—both are heavens where the Primordial Beginning abides. In the sixth chapter of the upper scroll, "Purple Essence within the Great Nonbeing," the Purple Essence Heaven is formed by the congealing of the Three Primes’ qi, governed by a Perfected Lord named the Three Primes Purple Essence Lord. In this ninth chapter, "Purple Essence Nurtures the Flourishing Forest," it refers to the Purple Essence Heaven of the Upper Clarity realm, where there is a Flourishing Forest with leaves like bamboo, flowers like mirrors, and fruit like plums. Heavenly beings who eat of it attain long life without aging and ascend as upper immortals. An ancient poem says: "In the Purple Essence Heaven’s Flourishing Forest, / Crimson fruit and vermilion branches, bamboo leaves deep. / Chewing the lush blossoms, one does not age; / Below, one watches the birds and hares exchange the light of time." Yet this is not a sight the lower realms can behold.

Within the human, the kidney water is black, the heart fire red. When these two qi unite, they transform into pure yang, and the purple golden essence flourishes into a forest. When the fruit ripens, one’s true self may partake of it to cultivate the Dao of longevity. As in the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit*, which speaks of "the jade blossoms and yellow flourishes, the wild and luxuriant branches of the jade forest in the life-gate," and the *Wenchang Scripture*, which says, "The cinnabar forest flourishes with vermilion branches"—all convey this meaning, illustrating what the human should nurture.

Within the Great Void beyond all bounds lies the Long Slumber.
"Slumber" means absolute stillness, unmoving—like one who sleeps without departing. The "Great Void" is the realm of emptiness and quiescence, as when the monk Budai or Chen Tuan slept for months on end, dust gathering upon their bodies—true breath in profound stillness.

From the Jade Chamber, treasure clouds arise.
The Jade Chamber—also called the space between the brows—is the aperture of the viscera and joints. Naturally, it generates clouds of five-colored *qi*; where vital *qi* is born, spirit is born. The scriptures speak of the "Golden Chamber and Jade Abode" and the "Purple Portal and Jade Palace" where spirit is simultaneously generated—all of the same meaning.

Within the nine-gated womb and embryo.
Nine revolutions, nine returns—thus the elixir path is complete. The embryo gestates for nine months, the nine *qi* coalescing, and the human path is perfected. This passage describes the eighth month fulfilled, nearing the ninth, *qi* replete and spirit complete, the sacred embryo whole, awaiting the moment of stirring.

The Imperial Guest presents the Jade Talisman.
Not the Emperor presenting *my* talisman—Chapter Six speaks of the "True Yang Imperial Guest, the Elder." The Imperial Guest is the yang spirit, charged with dispelling yin evil, bearing the Jade Talisman to act, like the Three Elders of the state who uphold the sovereign’s decree to rectify governance.

The Three Lights return beneath the Purple Canopy.
The Three Lights of heaven are the sun, moon, and stars; the Three Lights of the human are the two eyes and the heart. When the sun and moon lose their measure, stars linger or hide, and heaven and earth suffer calamity. When the eyes are beguiled and the heart moved, the body falters. "Return beneath the Purple Canopy" means that when the eyes do not gaze upon evil sights nor the ears hear evil sounds, when one withdraws vision and reverses hearing, spirit is preserved and *qi* congeals. The Purple Canopy covers all without exception. Thus, the two eyes are called the radiant canopy of the nine apertures. As the sun, moon, and stars illuminate heaven and earth, the two eyes and the heart oversee the body, shielding it from external obstructions.

The Azure Jade *Bin* comes to life.
*Wufu* is stone resembling jade, used to counterfeit it—now transformed into true jade. In this passage, the Black *Qi* Lord is named *Binlaisheng*, who governs the inner illumination of human virtue. "Azure" (*cang*) is not written as "granary" (*cang*); it refers to the blue-green jade, signifying the emergence of veined patterns. Jade is compared to virtue: without perfect virtue, the perfect Dao does not coalesce. When inner cultivation is profound, its radiance shines forth externally—like jade within a mountain, where no grass or tree fails to flourish; like a pearl in the depths, where rivers and streams are all clarified; like a treasure held within, where the face glows with luster and the body thrives in health.

Guard this through the Long Night Assembly.
The Long Night Assembly resides in the Crimson Palace, the numinous treasury, the place where blood is generated. When awake, it is ever bright; when unaware, it is ever dark. "Guard" means to correct and rescue from evil. Those who cannot cherish it remain in the endless night—when will dawn come?

The Five Spirits bestow the register of passage.
The Five Spirits are the Azure Spirit, Vermilion Spirit, Luminous Spirit, Mysterious Spirit, and Yellow Spirit. "Bestow" means to confer—the Five Elders grant me the register of longevity. The *Jade Scripture* of Mount Mao omits the following six lines, concluding here.

The Nine Governances unite with the Nine Lights.
The method of the Nine Governances is to gather the talismans of the Emperor’s Nine Lights to assemble the spirits. This is the Dao of returning wind and merging as one. When the number nine is encountered, yang is abundant—this yang is pure and unceasing. The *Great Cavern Scripture* states: "From the One *qi* arises the Two *qi*, from the Two *qi* arises the Nine *qi*." Nine yang is the extreme number, then it transforms into duality, becoming thirty-six. There is the "Empress of the Nine Lights, the Holy Mother of the True One," who presides over matters of birth and nurture. Some say: "The *Original Scripture*—this must be an error." "Governance" (*tong*) means record; in high antiquity, the Nine Sovereigns had nine records, as found in ancient texts.

The Three Mysteries emerge from the Grand Clarity.
The Three Mysteries are the Three Threes, the Nine Mysteries. "Emerge from the Grand Clarity" refers to the Lower Field, externally corresponding to the Northern Capital of Fengdu, internally to the two kidneys. It speaks of the ancestors and progenitors transcending this realm, where the spirit ascends to the Nine Heavens, forever becoming a perfected one.

The Purple Yang gives rise to the myriad beings.
The Jade Treasury of Purple Yang is the palace of life’s generation, whence the roots of all existence across ten thousand generations are activated, and all spirits are complete. Regardless of rank, all humans emerge from the arising of Purple Yang—this principle of ceaseless generation endures forever.

The Mysterious Essence nurtures the Nine Spirits.
The Mysterious Essence nurtures the Nine Souls. Heaven takes the north as mysterious; humans take the heart as mysterious. The Nine Spirits are the nine apertures of the heart. The Nine Mysteries receive life because the Nine Souls are nurtured, enabling the formation of the embryo. Thus, the essence is bathed in the Great Yang.

The Primordial Father forms the Embryo Immortal.
The Primordial Father, as noted earlier, is the heart’s office of thought—also called intention. The "Embryo Immortal" possesses *qi* but no breath. The lower scroll speaks of the "Purple Flower leading the Embryo Immortal," and the *Yellow Court Scripture* says: "The zither heart in triple layers dances with the Embryo Immortal"—both express the same meaning.

The above Jade Stanza, in celestial script, comprises seventy characters, and above it governs the Crimson Brightness and Harmonious Yang Heaven, the third celestial governance of the Earth Sovereign of the Cinnabar-Colored Land.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: "Recite it nine times, and the Nine Governances of the Emperor convene, the Nine Light Spirits assemble, the hundred spirits merge as one, and one’s years equal those of heaven. The Eight Assemblies gather in wandering, paying homage to the Nine Heavens. The ten thousand *qi* ascend together as immortals, attaining the Gate of Perfection."

The Primordial Heavenly King says: "This is the tenth Jade Stanza of the *Great Cavern of Wenchang*, the month when form and spirit are firmly consolidated, and the embryo is transformed through spiritual transcendence."

*Gui-si*, *Jia-wu*, *Great Strength*, *Advance*.

The pure radiance of Brahma’s clear luminous *qi*, its colors blue, yellow, and white, congeals to form the Central Heavenly Realm, called the *Boli Dahuo* Heaven. Within this heaven, the *qi* of central yang presides over the Yellow Court Palace of the Middle Prime, where the Imperial True *qi* of Harmonious Balance descends to infuse spirit and distribute *qi*, solidifying form and essence, giving rise to the human path.

The Azure Spirit fans the Eight Extremities.
The Eastern Beginning Elder is the land of arising, thus fanning and stirring the world of the Eight Extremities. The Eight Extremities are the four cardinal and four intermediate directions—the Eight Trigrams: *Qian*, *Kan*, *Gen*, *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Li*, *Kun*, *Dui*; the Eight Gates: Open, Rest, Life, Wound, Barrier, View, Death, Fright.

The Wheel Drums the Three Flowers’ Citadel
The Three Flowers are the *shen*, *qi*, and *jing*; the Citadel is where the Three Flowers reside. The Azure Spirit’s *qi* drums and arouses the intent of arising. The Wheel is the name of the tongue spirit—when one drums the root of the tongue, stirring the Jade Pond’s fluids to irrigate the Three Fields.

Breaking the Knots of the Womb-Cauldron
*Breaking* (alternately *uprooting*): The *Scripture on Generating Spirit* states, “Sever the stagnant roots of the womb-tree.” The meaning is the same—*breaking* means to brush away, to untie, to dissolve the knotted roots of womb-cauldron habits. As the *Scripture on Generating Spirit* says, “When the womb-knots’ roots are untied,” this is precisely the meaning.

The Seven Ancestors Receive Blessings and Rebirth
The Nine Mysteries’ Seven Ancestors receive these blessings and ascend to heaven, enjoying bliss. If one can advance with diligence and unceasing cultivation, one ascends to the Formless Heavens, attains the Stage of Non-Retrogression, and ultimately climbs to the position of attendant minister in the Great Lofty Three Realms of the Supreme Perfected.

Karmic Adversaries Vanish Across the Five Paths
The *Scripture on Generating Spirit* states, “When karmic adversaries exhaust the great cycle of destiny, they are eradicated.” One eliminates the enmity of past lives and extinguishes the malevolent affairs of the Five Paths. The Five Paths are hell, hungry ghosts, animals, *asuras*, and birds and insects—realms from which escape is difficult.

Constantly Guard the Imperial One’s Camp
Maoshan divides this into two sections: the Feminine One, the Masculine One, and the Imperial One are called the Way of the Three Ones. Here, one guards only the Imperial One’s camp, for it is the most revered—the Great Cavern’s Imperial One. The Hidden Teachings include the *Scripture of the Feminine One* and the *Scripture of the Masculine One*.

The Duke’s Son Holds the Five Talismans
The Left Radiant Duke’s Son, styled *Xuanyuan Shu*, aligns the talismans. Riding the *qi* of the Nine Yangs of the East, he grasps the Five Spirits’ talismans, nurturing the myriad beings. He summons the Nine *Hun* Spirits within the liver, dispersing them throughout the world—thus the human path is born.

The Supreme One Dwells in the Purple Chamber
The Supreme One resides in the head, which is the Purple Gate. Within the human body are golden towers, jade chambers, purple gates, and jasper palaces. The Purple Gate is a separate chamber of the Muddy Pellet; the Supreme One Lord dwells there, overseeing the registers of immortals who attain the Dao.

The Three Converge at the Earth Gate Below
The Three *qi* unite in virtue; the Three Harmonies form a resonance. The *qi* of arising converges in the Lower Prime Palace. The Earth Gate below is the Gate of Death—*Qian* is the Heavenly Gate, *Xun* is the Earthly Gate, which is the Lower Field, as noted in the commentary on the Earth Gate’s protective guardians.

Uprooting Life to the Jade Emperor’s Palace
One uproots the life-pulse of human arising and elevates it to the Jade Emperor’s Palace, which is in the brain above. The Jade Capital Mountain contains the Jade Emperor’s Palace, presided over by the Upper Prime, where celestial immortals dwell. Only through cultivating the Dao and performing good deeds can one reach this place.

The Maiden Yu Mozi
The true immortal within the Dipper resides in the human heart, governing lifespan, poverty, and wealth. She is also a spirit of the Feminine One, belonging to the ranks of immortal maidens. As primordial true *qi*, she assists heaven and earth in nurturing the myriad beings, embodying the Great Dao to praise the ten thousand transformations.

Wei Zhao Guards the Seven *Qi* Windows
*Wei Zhao* is how Daoists refer to themselves, saying, “This minor servant, so-and-so.” The Seven *Qi* Windows are the seven orifices of the heart, likened to windows for their clarity—this is the meaning of “eight windows, exquisitely wrought,” all elegant metaphors and skillful analogies.

Restraining and Pledging the Blood and Fluids
The True Man of the Nine Primes, named *Juzhi* the Guardian, connects the left ear to the heart. The heart governs the generation of blood and fluids. By restraining and pledging them, one prevents them from being overcome by blood-*qi* or invaded by perverse *qi*, ensuring all returns to correctness and grandeur.

Filling the Five Viscera to Overflowing
If one can refine the utmost truth without being harmed by sensual desires, then the fluids, blood, *qi*, and liquids will fill the five viscera, six bowels, and three hundred sixty joints, accumulating strength. The complexion will be joyful and vigorous, and one’s lifespan will equal the pine and cypress.

The Ten Perfected Ascend to the Purple Chamber
(One version says *Yellow Chamber*, which is incorrect—the Purple Chamber is in the brain.) The Ten Perfected are the Ten Flower Perfected Ones, who ascend from below to the Purple Chamber, which is the Hall of Brightness in the brain, as seen in the *Great Mystery’s Nine Qi’s Upper Mystery Contract*.

The Emperor’s Son Transforms into a Golden Immortal
The *hun* of the August One ascends and is styled the Emperor’s Son. *Gold* refers to the White Tiger of *geng* and *xin*, refined into returning elixir. Ingesting it transforms one’s *qi* and substance into gold and jade, hence a later passage states, “Flesh and bones become gold and jade,” which refers precisely to this.

The White Jade Flying Talisman Summons
The White Jade Flying Talisman of the Jade Capital summons the adept, enabling them to shed the womb and change the cauldron, naturally achieving transcendence. The *Scripture on Generating Spirit* states, “Celebrate this infant’s molting”—this is the way of human birth after ten months in the womb, and the immortal’s shedding of the womb.

Guiding Ascent to the Dragon Terrace Heaven
One is guided upward to the Dragon Terrace Heaven. The Dragon Terrace is the Heaven of Dragon Transformation and Brahma Crossing, referring to the unfathomable transformations. Like the Yellow Emperor of Xuanyuan, who rode a dragon chariot into the sky in broad daylight with a thousand attendants, or the Jin-dynasty figures like Xu Jingshan, who all rode dragons and drove clouds to ascend and pay court to the Jade Clarity—all are recorded in the annals, clearly verifiable. These are transformations of one’s own yin and yang *qi*, becoming clouds and dragons to ride away, not coming from outside. As the *Mystery Contract* says, “Transformations occur naturally.” If one teaches the completion of the sacred embryo in ten months, one can shed the womb and spiritually transform. For those of the Life School, refining the golden elixir and perfecting the ten-month work is the completion. For those of the Nature School, striving to grasp the mechanism, suddenly achieving great enlightenment in a single word, is the completion. For the dull-rooted, who may not awaken to the Dao for twenty or thirty years, there is a distinction between sudden and gradual. Those who aspire to the Dao must not neglect either.

Some say the Dao is not worth studying, but they do not know that the Three Teachings ultimately return to one principle. One must reach the utmost goodness to arrive at the place of rest. The Dao says: “There is a thing, chaotically formed, born before heaven and earth. Silent and void, it stands alone and does not change.” Buddhism says: “The Perfect Awakening and True Suchness are born together with life. If one seeks me through form or pursues me through sound, one walks the wrong path.”

The Confucian says: "Heaven begets the teeming masses; all things have their principles. Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety." These are the embodiments of the sages of the Three Teachings. The Dao says: "In true constancy, one responds to things—constantly responding, constantly quiescent." The Buddhist says: "Perfectly round, radiantly luminous, vividly alive, utterly unobstructed." The Confucian says: "Filled to repletion and thus resplendent is called greatness; great and transformed is called sageliness; sagely yet unfathomable is called spirit." These are the functions of the sages of the Three Teachings.

Buddhism speaks of "no self, no others"; Confucianism speaks of "no obstinacy, no self"—these are all the most fitting and unifying words. Why cling and fail to penetrate? Why remain distant and fail to attain? Those who seek the supreme vehicle must pay heed to this and not rigidly adhere to doctrines that deceive and harm the nature of life.

The above jade inscription in celestial script comprises ninety characters, governing above the Xuanming Gonghua Heaven and ruling below the Third Rampart’s Emperor De Jun.

The *Xuanqi* states: "Recite it ten times, and within the form, the Primordial Destiny of the Original Destiny coalesces into the Perfected One of the Imperial Unity. Nine harmonies and ten unions—embodied, one naturally attains thorough penetration of the true. Able to summon and command the ten directions, to govern the primordial and return the numinous, the myriad qi become perfected, virtue and dark wisdom merge. Profound beyond bounds, transformations arise spontaneously."

At this stage of cultivation, it is called the Mysterious Pass, also known as the Mysterious Assembly. The Six Perfections and Ten Returns—when merit is complete and the Dao is perfected—one ascends to the rank of Immortal Duke. First, the Ten Faiths; next, the Ten Goodnesses; then, the Ten Blossomings; then, the Ten Virtues; gradually advancing to the Ten Immortals; and finally, transforming into the Ten Perfected. Having ascended the six ranks, with wondrous practice fully accomplished, body, spirit, and qi refined, one is titled a Perfected Person.

The Ten Faiths, Ten Goodnesses, Ten Blossomings, Ten Virtues, Ten Immortals, and Ten Perfected are called the Six Ranks Entering the Gate of Myriad Wonders.

*Jade Clarity’s Wondrous Ultimate and Comprehensive Perfected Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture*, Scroll Four
● "Two Qi" should likely read "Three Qi."

*Commentary on Jade Clarity’s Wondrous Ultimate and Comprehensive Perfected Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture*, Scroll Five
Annotated by Zhongyangzi Wei Qi of Mount Penglai in Eastern Shu

The Dao speaks: At that time, this scroll’s wondrous practices are cultivated through the six roots together with nature-and-life, essence-and-blood, fluids-and-saliva, hands-and-feet. If the six roots are pure, one does not fall into the Six Caverns of Fengdu. The Six Caverns are: Zhou’s Cut-Off Yin Heaven, Tai’s Slaying Deceitful Matters Ancestral Heaven, Mingchen’s Enduring Offense Martial City Heaven, Tianzhao’s Sinful Qi Heaven, Zongling’s Seven Transgressions Heaven, and Gansi’s Linked Curved Layers Heaven. If nature-and-life are pure, one does not fall into the Five Marchmounts Hell; if essence-and-blood are pure, one does not fall into the Water Palace Hell; if hands-and-feet are pure, one does not fall into the Nine Darks’ Eighteen Prisons; if fluids-and-saliva are pure, one can generate the five spirits—Wu Ying, Bai Yuan, Tai Yi, Si Ming, and Tao Kang—together attaining the Ten Penetrations’ wondrous practices.

The *Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture* has long been practiced in Shu, yet the Shu edition still contains errors. Since no one has ever verified the facts and block-printed it, "a character passes through three transcriptions, and a bird becomes a horse." For instance, at the scripture’s opening, the four characters "The Dao speaks: At that time" are the Jade Emperor Dao Lord’s preface. When the Heavenly King expounded the scripture, he began with such causes and conditions—just as Buddhist sutras begin with "Thus have I heard" and the *Analects* with "The Master said." These cannot be omitted; they must be restored. Though I, Qi, may incur the charge of presumption, I do so to preserve the scripture’s intent.

Every scripture comprises three divisions: the introductory section, the main doctrinal section, and the dissemination section. The old edition lacks these four characters, thus omitting the introductory section. The introductory section should begin with "The Dao speaks," the main doctrinal section should comprise the thirty-six chapters, and the concluding passage should serve as the dissemination section. Why has this scripture circulated in Shu? It is because the Primordial Emperor Lord was first born in Haohui—present-day Gusu—where he received this scripture and attained fruition as the deity of Shu. He then propagated this scripture to enlighten humans and gods. The Primordial Emperor was reborn in the dingwei year, when the Celestial Emperor appointed him as the Yang Official of the Southern Dipper, the office governing birth. Thus, those seeking heirs often prayed to him, and it became known that Wenchang was Nanchang, the deity overseeing the nurturing and cultivation of virtue.

According to historical records, at the end of the Jingde era, Academician Le, serving as the Resident Censor of the Western Capital, suddenly dreamed of a man in full court attire who declared, "The Emperor commands your presence." Le followed him and soon beheld magnificent palaces. When he asked the messenger whose they were, the reply was, "This is the Emperor’s abode." Upon ascending, the Emperor said, "You govern those seeking heirs. I have chosen one for you." Shortly after, a man was selected, and the Emperor said, "Those in the Central Plains seek heirs. Go and do not refuse." The man kowtowed three times, begging to be excused, but the Emperor said, "Go!" A courtier standing nearby said, "This is the Barefoot Immortal Li Shouwei of Nanchang." The following year, Emperor Renzong was born. Thus, it is clear that Wenchang governs the office of heirship and prosperity.

Each sentence of this scripture governs a single matter. If one can practice even one sentence, one may ascend as a superior immortal—how much more so for those who recite the entire volume? How could there be no karmic response? Yet in this world, there are Daoist priests who live and die without ever hearing the name of the *Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture*. Some, upon seeing that the scripture does not explicitly discuss the retribution of good and evil, set it aside on a high shelf. Others, though fond of recitation, do not understand its principles. Yet the scripture does indeed speak of good and evil retribution. For instance, it speaks of "delivering one from the five bitter poisons" and "transcending form to reach the Beginning Azure." If one has no sins, how could one fall into the five sufferings? If one has no merit, how could one reach the Beginning Azure? Such examples are numerous.

Other scriptures say, "Recite and uphold this scripture," but what does "this scripture" truly signify? It refers to this very heart. If one cannot guard this heart with care—indulging in deceit, recklessness, perversion, and excess, violating reason and propriety—then in life, one will suffer from grave illness and imprisonment, and in death, one will be cast into ditches, devoured by flies and gnats. How could the gods of heaven and earth spare such a one, consigning them to the Avīci Hell to endure endless torment? As the Buddhist texts say, "Even if the karma one creates over a hundred kalpas does not perish, when the conditions converge, one will still receive the retribution oneself." The tradition states, "Misfortune and fortune have no doors; it is man who invites them." Is this not the retribution of good and evil?

Here, I have appended verified examples to inspire reverence and faith in the reader, that they may cultivate each practice step by step and ascend the gates of the ten immortals. Even those of shallow capacity may attain clarity regarding past circumstances and achieve the Way of *shijie* (liberation through apparent death). There are five types of *shijie*: water liberation (drowning), fire liberation (self-immolation), metal liberation (being cut by blades), wood liberation (transforming while leaning against a tree), and earth liberation (entering mountains or stones). The Mysterious Woman has methods for cultivating the five liberations to escape great calamities, evade yin pursuers, and flee to other realms, where one may seize a womb or take over a body.

The Primordial Heavenly King’s brows emit azure radiance. How vast is the Way of the Sage! Overflowing, it nurtures the myriad things, towering to the heavens. Observing the founding masters of the Three Teachings, who established their doctrines for the world, we see they never adhered to partiality. Yet people forcibly distinguish them, saying Buddhism governs nature, Daoism governs life, and Confucianism governs principle. They do not realize that these three are one. When the Buddha expounded the Dharma, his brows emitted white radiance; when the Primordial One expounded the Dao, his brows emitted azure radiance. Did these two sages manifest different signs of excellence? The white radiance of the Western direction is the qi of metal, which, though it represents nature, encompasses life within it. The azure radiance of the Eastern direction is the yang qi, which, though it represents life, encompasses nature within it. The Way of nature and life mutually constitute the human being. As the *Doctrine of the Mean* states, "What Heaven imparts is called nature; following nature is called the Way."

What Heaven bestows upon me is life; what I receive and embody is nature. When we speak of nature, life is within it; when we speak of life, nature is within it. Thus, the seventh chapter of the middle volume states, "The root of nature and life is firm." What, then, are nature and life? In terms of nature, they are benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom—the four beginnings, the five constants, and the principles of the myriad things and affairs, all encompassed within. In terms of life, they are *yuan*, *heng*, *li*, and *zhen*—the four seasons, the five phases, and the transformations of the myriad beings, all issuing forth from them. This is the luminous principle of Heaven, yet people obscure it with selfish desires and cannot restore the original purity of their source. Thus, the sages, in accordance with what humans are endowed with, cultivated and clarified moral standards, established teachings for the world, and enabled people to fulfill the Way of utmost sincerity. Then, the original countenance reappears before them. As it is said, "Only the utmost sincerity under Heaven can fully realize one’s nature, thereby assisting Heaven and Earth, and aiding in transformation and nourishment, as if shown on the palm of the hand."

Some may ask, "You annotate Daoist scriptures yet cite Buddhist sutras and Confucian texts. Is this not excessive?" I reply: The sages of the Three Teachings originally aimed to correct human evil and guide all toward the good Way. Thus, it is said, "There are not two Ways under Heaven; the sages do not have two hearts." It is like entering a city—one must pass through its gates. Though the palaces may differ, the destination is the same. If people fully realize their aspirations, where can they not go? Therefore, I have harmonized the classics and pronouncements to elucidate them. What fault is there in this?

The crown revolves with purple qi; the myriad-flowered treasure canopy floats and covers the form. Purple qi arises from the union of yin and yang qi, signifying the origin of life. Within this purple qi, the myriad-flowered treasure canopy takes shape, shading the Dharma body. Above each person’s head, there is also a flower canopy, though they do not see it. The scripture says, "Purple clouds cover the Yellow and the Old," referring to the Three Treasure Lords—this is precisely what it means.

When one cultivates the Dao, even spirits and gods cannot perceive their boundaries—only a radiant red light surges forth, dazzling the eyes. Jade-like brilliance and golden auroras coil and shimmer in resplendent splendor. Like the luminous glow of jade and the iridescent hues of gold, they twist and gleam, flashing before the eyes of heaven and humanity. Such is the light of the Seventeen Emperors, all emanating from within oneself.

The Jade Emperor Dao Lord and the Great Mystery Dao Father bow their heads in reverent anticipation, wishing to hear the profound chapters. Beneath the title of the *Cavern Scripture*, it is recorded that the Great Mystery Dao Father, Master Niu Zi, compiled this text—only here do we encounter the Jade Emperor Dao Lord and the Great Mystery Dao Father. The Jade Emperor is the Numinous Treasure of the Great Mystery; some mistakenly identify him as the Most High, though I, too, once doubted this. Now, in clarifying this, I recall a dream in which, before the hall of an old family estate, a herd of cattle gathered, and one bull charged at me. I warded it off with my staff, striking its left eye, while its hoof struck my face. I bit down on one of its toes and awoke with a start.

One day, I chanced upon the *Veritable Records*, which state: "The Most High transformed eighty-two times into the Dark Warrior, known as the Great Mystery." The *Descent of the Immortals* also says: "The ox is the essence of the Dark Warrior." Only then did I recall the *Book of Rites*, which calls the ox 'the Great Martial of the First Origin.' Thus, I realized that the Great Mystery and Master Niu Zi are none other than the Dark Emperor. The dream was no illusion.

The Dark Emperor was born in the first kalpa of the Heavenly Opening of the Yellow Emperor’s reign, in the first year of the Purple Cloud era, the *jiawu* year, on the third day of the third month. The *True Warrior Scripture* mistakenly records this as *jiachen*. At fifteen, he began studying the Dao and cultivating practice. After forty-two years, he ascended to the Purple Cloud at the age of fifty-seven, on the ninth day of the ninth month of the *gengyin* year. He was then appointed Marshal of the Great Mystery and forever entrusted with guarding the North. During the second kalpa of the Heavenly Dragon era, when King Zhou of Yin ruled with tyranny, demonic spirits ran rampant, harming living beings and sending toxic *qi* surging upward. The Primordial Beginning commanded him to capture them, and for his merit, he was restored to the Kan position and appointed Great General Zhenwu of the Heavenly Dark Warrior. Later, in the third year of the True Transformation era of Heaven—corresponding to the second year of the Jiayou reign—the Three Pure Ones entrusted the Jade Emperor with evaluating his merits. The Three Officials and Four Saints ranked him second only to the Heavenly Emperor. He was then appointed to the Hanlin Academy to compile the jade tablets, and the Great Mystery was elevated to the Dark Heavenly Emperor. Thus, I know this scripture was reissued upon his investiture. Originally comprising one hundred and twenty fascicles, the Great Mystery compiled these thirty-six chapters, which are also the origin of the thirty-six revered scriptures, making them easier to practice—much like the *Supreme Scripture of the Great Cavern*, which differs not from the wondrous first rank.

The term "reverent anticipation" signifies looking upward with devotion, while "wishing to hear" denotes listening with humility, composed and solemn, focused without distraction. One fears only that their reverence may falter or their demeanor may lack propriety—this is what is meant by "solemnity and uprightness suffice to govern." The heart of the Dao Father extends from self to others, embodying the Master’s way of loyalty and reciprocity. How could one not rejoice and sing with delight?

From this point onward, the six roots and six cavern palaces are taken in order to avoid disrupting the main principle.

The Primordial Heavenly King, contented, sings:
*"The Eleventh Jade Chapter of the Great Cavern of Wenchang—*
*The Cavern Vision of the Eye Root, where the Dao Eye first opens.*
*Yiwei, Bingchen, Mingyi, Jiaren."*

The preface recounts how the Jade Emperor Dao Lord narrated the origins and causes of the scripture—this is called the *Preface Section*. The main scripture consists of the Primordial Heavenly King’s proclamation of the luminous sounds—this is the *Orthodox Section*. The conclusion, also by the Dao Lord, summarizes the scripture’s essence—this is the *Circulation Section*.

*"The August One transcends the shadowless—"*

The eye’s relation to form is of great consequence. When the eye sees, the heart desires; when the heart stirs, the spirit wearies. Thus, the spirits of the five viscera all leak through the eye, making it the foremost root. The eye’s aperture connects to the heart, which is the abode of spirit. Once the eye sees, the heart inevitably stirs.

*"August"* means great, and *"above"* means lofty. It speaks of the Dao’s greatness and transcendence, rising beyond the realm of formlessness. Without form or light, it is called "shadowless." In this scripture, the character *"shadow"* appears twenty-eight times across three fascicles:
*"Eight shadows govern constant peace,
Eight shadows harmonize the Cavern Yang,
Eight shadows illuminate the Mud Pill,
The Great Clarity observes the Eight Shadows"*—all convey the same meaning.
*"Within the radiant shadow’s clarity,
The Great One reigns as Shadow King,
Bearing this shadowed person,
Qi emerges from the flower’s shadow,
Ever abiding within the shadow’s transformation"*—another shared meaning.
*"The Supreme Ultimate’s Primordial Shadow King,
The Great Simplicity brushes the ethereal shadow,
The red shadow veils the boundless,
The cavern shadow lodges spiritual penetration,
The Supreme Ultimate’s Mysterious Shadow Youth,
The feathered shadow of the Great Void’s court,
The golden watchtower’s upper shadow qi,
The unified jade shadow qi,
The yellow shadow qi of the morning’s midst"*—all belong to the same category.
*"The August One transcends the shadowless,
The Great Void’s emptiness is shadowless"*—another category.
*"Riding the shadow’s morning radiance,
Driving the shadow to ascend the distant clouds"*—another category.
*"The Emperor’s One ascends the bright shadow,
Brightness gives rise to the Emperor’s shadow"*—another category.
*"The Two Origins ascend the shadow’s thoroughfare"*—another category.
*"The Eight Perfected unite as Shadow Lords,
A thousand shadows arise in solemnity"*—another category.
*"The Three Heavens illuminate the Nine Shadows"*—a distinct meaning, though the character is the same.

Some interpret *"shadow"* as chariots, robes, or regalia; others as banners, pendants, or standards; still others as the colors of light and *qi*; or as the names of gods and perfected beings. In various scriptures and traditions, there are *"shadow-morning radiant aurora crowns,"* *"shadow robes,"* *"shadow standards,"* and *"shadow chariots."* Yet no one knows what these objects truly are. In my humble estimation, they resemble the seven treasures of officials today—crowns, hats, sashes, belts, saddles, and bridles. The *Jade Emperor Scripture* speaks of *"nine auroras streaming shadows"* and *"flying cloud jade chariots,"* which are similar. Here, *"shadowless"* refers to formlessness. If one can withdraw their gaze and turn inward, they will naturally reach the realm of emptiness and non-being.

*"The wheel of the Nine Luminaries halts."*

Some say *"the Nine Luminaries arise,"* but this is surely an error. It means the sun and moon pause their movement, and the Jade Armillary Sphere ceases its rotation. The *qi* of humanity originates in the primordial chaos of the Great Vastness, yet it cannot be preserved and nurtured due to the leakage through the eye root. Now, having realized this and begun cultivation, one transcends the realm of formlessness. Thus, the Jade Armillary Sphere and the Jade Crossbar halt their turning, awaiting the proof of one’s attainment.

In heaven, it revolves the celestial axle, transforming the Nine *Qi* to nurture the myriad things of heaven and earth. Only the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper circulate day and night—this is what is meant by *"the Jade Armillary and Jade Crossbar aligning the Seven Governors."* Within the heart, the Seven Primes likewise operate, sharing the same ceaseless mechanism as the Nine Primes of heaven. Thus, as humans, we must strive unceasingly, fortifying our will to align with the celestial workings.

*"Luminaries"* refers to the radiance of the eye’s spirit. When the gaze is fixed, the Nine Orifices all come to rest. As the *Book of Songs* says: *"The child cherishes bright virtue, neither loud in voice nor harsh in countenance"*—this expresses the same principle.

*"Revolving wind blends with the Emperor’s Heart."*
The *"Emperor’s Heart"* is the Dao-Heart. *"The human heart is perilous; the Dao-Heart is subtle. Only through refinement and unity can one hold fast to the center."* The heart, as a thing, is serene, pure, empty, and luminous—like a mirror’s void or a scale’s balance. It governs the entire body, encompassing all principles and responding to all affairs. Even spirits cannot fathom its depths. Every movement and every breath is bound to it. Thus, the *Great Learning* teaches that the Way lies in rectifying the heart.

*Laozi* said: *"The five colors blind the eye."* When people are obscured by material desires, they cannot perceive the transformations of heaven and earth. Therefore, the sages established teachings to *"withdraw the gaze and return the hearing,"* making the rejection of cleverness and the abandonment of sagely wisdom urgent tasks. If one can preserve the heart and nurture the nature, then the myriad things of heaven and earth will vividly appear before them.

*Mencius* said: *"There is no better way to nurture the heart than to reduce desires."* If one can diminish desires, they will attain the *"heart-fasting"* of Yanzi’s *"sitting in forgetfulness."* Thus, the sages *"washed the heart and retired into secrecy"* to achieve the perfection of the Dao.

This chapter focuses on cultivation through the eye root. The eye has several interpretations. Buddhist scriptures speak of the *"flesh eye, heavenly eye, wisdom eye, dharma eye, and Buddha eye."* The *"flesh eye"* belongs to ordinary beings—what the world calls the *"vulgar eye."* The *"Buddha eye"* is the *"Dao eye."* By the standards of common people, the vulgar eye observes heaven and earth. The perfected person observes heaven and earth with the Dao eye. Where is the Dao eye? It must be said: in the One Heart. Within, there are the five viscera and six bowels, yet they are separated by the body’s barrier. Without, there are the Five Movements and Six *Qi*, yet they are separated by heaven and earth. If observed with the vulgar eye, none can be seen. But if observed with the Dao eye, one sees through both inner and outer, beyond the Nine Heavens, and even the tiniest speck of dust is illuminated.

*"Revolving wind blends in union"*—the *qi* of heaven and earth intermingle to form the *"Emperor’s One True Dao Samadhi."* Humans are the same: using saliva as the dragon and emptiness as the tiger, the Way of circulation lies in these two things. The *Book of Changes* says: *"Clouds follow the dragon; wind follows the tiger. When the sage arises, the myriad things behold him."* The principles are closely aligned.

Later, the ninth chapter says: *"The Emperor’s Heart is the Great Mystery’s thoroughfare."* Formerly, Yu Linggui of Hejian practiced the *"Great Cavern’s Revolving Wind Blending Dao"* for twenty years. While seated, he could perceive all affairs under heaven, yet he concealed his abilities and appeared no different from others. His countenance remained as that of a man in his thirties, his clothes worn as ever. When asked about events near or far, he answered as if witnessing them firsthand. People revered him, though he would say, *"It is mere happenstance, not something I know."* He never ceased reciting the *Great Cavern Sutra*, sometimes abstaining from grain to drink wine. Later, he suddenly ascended as an immortal, having attained the *"Revolving Wind Emperor’s Heart."* When one turns the light of both eyes inward to reflect, true *qi* follows and gathers in the original palace—this is called *"revolving wind blending in union."*

*"The Eight Sceneries revolve, ever tranquil."*
Some say *"Eight Qi,"* but this is incorrect. The heart is heaven; the kidneys are earth. The distance between heart and kidneys is eight inches and four parts; the distance between heaven and earth is eighty-four thousand miles. The *"spirit wind bellows"* ensures the stability of heaven and earth. For humans, the movement of true *qi* ensures the body’s enduring peace.

The human body’s Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries—from the coccyx to the *Baihui*—are divided into three sections per barrier, totaling twenty-four nodes corresponding to the Twenty-Four *Qi*.

**Upper Division’s Eight Sceneries:**
- Brain Spirit: *Awakened Origin Child*, styled *Dao Capital*
- Hair Spirit: *Mysterious Pattern Florescence*, styled *Dao Balance*
- Skin Spirit: *Penetrating Multitude Second*, styled *Dao Link*
- Eye Spirit: *Void Supervisor Life*, styled *Dao Weight*
- Cervical Marrow Spirit: *Spiritual Model Cover*, styled *Dao Cycle*
- Spinal Spirit: *Beneficial Passage Aide*, styled *Dao Pillar*
- Nose Spirit: *Surging Dragon Jade*, styled *Dao Subtle*
- Tongue Spirit: *Primordial Beam Peak*, styled *Dao Branch*

**Middle Division’s Eight Sceneries:**
- Throat Spirit: *Hundred Streams Release*, styled *Dao Passage*
- Lung Spirit: *Plain Spirit Life*, styled *Dao Level*
- Heart Spirit: *Radiant Yang Prosperity*, styled *Dao Bright*
- Liver Spirit: *Opening Lord Youth*, styled *Dao Azure*
- Gallbladder Spirit: *Dragon Virtue Restrainer*, styled *Dao Release*
- Left Kidney Spirit: *Spring Prime True*, styled *Dao Minister*
- Right Kidney Spirit: *Image Earth None*, styled *Dao Life*
- Spleen Spirit: *Treasure Origin Complete*, styled *Dao Soaring*

**Lower Division’s Eight Sceneries:**

- Right Yin-Left Yang Spirit: *Embracing Bright Manifest*, styled *Dao Life*

Within humans, the *"Purple River Carriage"* constantly transports the *qi* of true essence upward to the *Niwan*. *"Constant"* means enduring; *"tranquil"* means peaceful—ensuring the body’s perpetual well-being.

Some say the *"Eight Sceneries"* are the *"Eight Gates,"* as employed in *Dun Jia*. Formerly, Shi Cun served Huang Luzi and obtained the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, which included the *Eight Gates Dun Jia*. He could perform the arts of *Dun* transformation and illusion, commanding tigers and leopards. In the first year of the Yongkang era of Jin, on the seventh day of the fourth month, he rode a leopard to ascend to heaven, becoming the *"Perfected of Balanced Harmony and Manifest Simplicity."* This is the clear verification of the Eight Sceneries.

Within the vast expanse, the radiant clouds intermingle with the divine heavens. The celestial deities number eighteen thousand, the human deities eighteen thousand—together thirty-six thousand—all in harmonious accord with the workings of yin and yang. As the *Book of Songs* says: *"The divine arrives in thought."* According to the teachings of the Elder of Green City: the hair becomes the Lord of Green City; the head, the Lords of the Three Terraces; the brows, the Lords of the Purple Ultimate; the eyes, the Lords of Mystic Clarity; the left ear, the Lord of Sagacity; the right ear, the Lord of Resoluteness; the nose, the Lord of Heaven’s Wondrous Portal; the mouth, the Lord of the Gate of Teeth; the lips, the Lords of the Jade Portal; the teeth, the Twenty-Eight Primordial Lords of the Extremities; the throat, the Lord Commander; the larynx, the Nine Ministers; the liver, the Lord of the Crimson Palace; the lungs, the Lord of the Florid Canopy; the gallbladder, the Lord of Longevity; the heart, the Lord of the Cinnabar Field; the vessels, the Lord of the Purple Silk; the stomach, the Lord of the Grand Granary; the spleen, the Lord of the Yellow Court; the left kidney, the Lord of the Mysterious Wondrous; the right kidney, the Lord of the Mysterious Origin; the large intestine, the Lord Nourishing Mother; the small intestine, the Lord of Guiding and Conducting; the abdomen, the Lord of the Grand Dao; the Triple Burner, the Lord of the Mysterious Elder; the left foot, the Lord of Thunder and Lightning; the right foot, the Lord of Cloud and Qi. These thirty-six Lords of Vital Qi all correspond within the body, interlinked in form and function, mutually nurturing and operating as one.

The *Book of Changes* states: *"That which is unfathomable in yin and yang is called the divine."* Those who understand the Dao of transformation know the workings of the divine. It also says: *"The divine has no fixed form."* The *Classic of the Yin Talisman* declares: *"Humans know the divine as divine, yet do not know that the non-divine is the very source of divinity."* For the divine, as a thing, is governed solely by intention. Thus, the vast and boundless clouds and mists pay homage to the divine heavens—also named the *"Valley Spirit that never dies."* The *Niwan* is the gathering place of the hundred spirits; the deities within the human body assemble here. Their gathering is neither swift nor slow, neither moving nor arriving—yet they are present. The divine operates concealed within seeing and hearing. If not for the leaks of the eyes and ears, it could be concentrated and gathered. Hence, the *Scripture of Salvation* states: *"Below, it stabilizes the human body’s Niwan and Crimson Palace; within, it governs the five qi, blending and uniting the hundred spirits."* The human body differs not from heaven and earth, sharing the same divine qi.

The Five Thearchs disperse solar essence. Now, the heavens above shine with boundless luminosity, to which the sun, moon, and stars are tethered. Above the divine heavens lie the sun and moon, just as the human head bears eyes. The Five Thearchs—referenced in the annotation on the *"Five Thearchs’ Ever-Preserving City"* in the preceding scroll—are identical here. Chapter Three of this scroll states: *"Within the sun, the five radiance unfold,"* echoing this passage. The Five Thearchs are the qi of the Five Phases: the Green Thearch guards the hun-soul, the White Thearch attends the po-soul, the Red Thearch nurtures qi, the Black Thearch circulates blood, and the Yellow Thearch governs the center. Heaven has the five stars, earth the five peaks, and humans the five viscera—above and below in mutual resonance. Yet when humans indulge in the passions of emotion—joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—stirring within and manifesting without, the local spirits, with their ten eyes and ten hands, observe and point. Thus, calamity and fortune, misfortune and blessing, all respond accordingly. As the saying goes: *"Misfortune and fortune have no gate; they are summoned by man alone."* Solar essence and lunar radiance, if ingested by humans, bestow luminous complexion and robust health. Thus, the preceding scroll states:

*"Auspicious qi nurtures the five clouds,
The five qi congeal in the ten directions,
The five numina transmit talismanic registers,
Filling and replenishing the five viscera,
The Five Elders assist the Jade Root."*

This scroll declares:

*"Blood congeals, the five blossoms level,
Within the sun, the five radiance unfold,
The five viscera plant the Jade Root,
Bowing and rising, they summon the five numina,
The five spirits return to infancy,
Refining and nurturing the five budding pearls,
Drawing forth the five poisons of suffering,
The omen bears the five talismanic registers,
The po-soul lies hidden in the five paths,
The five talismans seal the earth’s knots,
The five talismans weave the Purple Chamber,
The five registers mark the Round Court,
The Five Elders linger in attendance."*

The following scroll says:

*"The five celestial bodies are called the Trigger,
Swallowing saliva generates the five buds,
Gathering the spirit protects the five registers,
Blending within the chambers of the five suns,
The five paths bloom with golden splendor,
The Five Elders transform into youthful innocence,
The Grand Spread unfurls the five talismans,
The five viscera reflect pure serenity,
The five demons strike the six yin,
The five qi govern the central jaw,
The five paths illuminate the Three Heavens,
The Five Elders soar with the Jade Plow,
The Five Peaks respond to the command and arrive,
The Five Peaks open the numinous gate,
The Five Peaks come to the court,
The five clouds thicken in the void,
The Five Elders brandish crimson blossoms,
Grasping the five talismanic registers in the left hand."*

All such instances pertain to the qi of the Five Phases, flowing through the Three Powers as the root of transformation, generation, and nurturance. To *"disperse solar essence"* is to spread the qi of yang harmony, assisting in the creation and nurturing of the myriad things. Humans should constantly regulate the five viscera with the qi of solar essence, preserving and harmonizing the Grand Harmony. This is what is meant by *"The Dao of Qian transforms and each fulfills its nature and destiny."* When the five viscera are in harmony, the Five Constants are complete, and one is not indicted by the five spirits, pressed by the Five Peaks, illuminated by the five stars, or reported by the Five Thearchs. Then the five registers are revised—how could one be bound by the five movements, five paths, or five sufferings? What the noble person cannot attain lies only in what others do not see.

The fluids flow freely within the mysterious membranes.

The character "逸" appears in seven contexts: *Abode of Ease*, *Longevity Ease*, *Purple Ease*, *Void Ease*, *Verdant Ease*, and *Supreme Clarity Ease*.

*Liao* means tranquility, peace, and joy. Heaven and Earth revolve through the water phase in endless cycles, thus never decaying. Humans irrigate the five viscera with fluids, and so do not die; if the fluids dry up, the spirit has nothing to nourish it, and the form must perish. The *Mysterious Membrane* is the hidden water of the northern direction, veiled within a single layer; in the human body, the kidney-water likewise resides within the adipose membranes. When fluids, blood, and qi are constantly full, irrigating and moistening, the body grows strong and the countenance radiant.

The blood congeals into the *Five Florets in Equilibrium*.

Purple, green, and crimson florets are not true colors but external things. Though the eye beholds resplendent wealth and heavenly bliss, these are not to be coveted in the heart. The *Five Florets* are *Azure Floret*, *Cinnabar Floret*, *Pristine Floret*, *Mysterious Floret*, and *Yellow Floret*—speaking of the inner florets that naturally arise. When one nourishes the five viscera with blood and qi, the *Mysterious Pearl* is spontaneously born. As the *Yellow Court Scripture* says: *"Irrigate the Five Florets to plant the numinous root."* Once the Five Florets congeal, they transform into the *Four Numinous Beings*, fully guarding the center.

The *Yu Zhang* Daoist Xiao Weiyi, styled Mianzhi, wandered to Xiangfu Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou. Delighting in its secluded beauty, he built a retreat there, reciting the *Great Cavern Scripture* daily. One day, with eyes closed, he beheld the Four Numinous Beings standing guard and was suddenly awakened. From then on, his spirit and countenance were utterly transformed, his words extraordinary. He spontaneously composed poetry, and though over ninety, his white hair turned black, and he walked as swiftly as if flying. In the midst of pure qi, he bid farewell to the assembly and sat in transformation. His disciple Xu Qinlin later also departed while seated.

The *Precious Body* reflects the *Luminous Pearl*.

The *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture* is titled *Canghu Jiebao*, though its upper and middle scrolls are not seen—only the lower scroll reveals its meaning. *Bao* (precious) and *zhu* (pearl) are one, referring to the single grain of golden elixir within the body. It is called the *Māṇi Precious Pearl*, the *Grain-of-Millet Pearl*, the *Mysterious Pearl*, the *Dust-Returning Elixir of the Bright Window*, the *Divine Elixir*, the *Jade Flask Elixir*, the *Purple Gold Elixir*, the *Golden Fluid Returning Elixir*, the *Knife-Tip Great Medicine*, the *Sacred Embryo Infant*—a thousand names and ten thousand titles, all referring to the same thing, far beyond the mere external ingredients of metals, minerals, herbs, or trees.

It is formed from one’s own *spirit-water*, *Flower Pool*, *golden essence*, *jade fluid*, *cinnabar*, *quicksilver*, *true lead*, *true mercury*, *dragon liver*, *phoenix marrow*, *crimson woman*, and *infant*, refined and tempered through cultivation. Thus, the upper scroll says: *"The Radiant Great Treasure shines"*; the upper palace says: *"Within the cloud-pearl"*; the middle scroll says: *"Licking and refining the Five Sprout Pearl"* and *"Entrusting and carrying the Moving Pearl"*; the lower scroll says: *"Leading the Canghu Pearl"*, *"Friend of the Precious Red Qi King"*, *"The Canghu’s radiant brilliance"*, *"A single revolution of the pearl in the sun"*, and *"The resplendent Round Pearl gleams"*—all expressing this same meaning.

The Confucian classics speak of the time before Heaven and Earth divided, when form was like a hen’s egg. The word *precious* is not idly attained; its value lies in its infinite responsiveness, fulfilling every desire without fail. As for worldly *wish-fulfilling jewels*, whatever one seeks is granted as the heart desires. The King of Wei possessed a pearl that illuminated twelve carriages before and behind; the *Pearl of Marquis Sui* and the *Uncut Jade of Bian He* were treasured by the world—how much more so the truly supreme and precious treasures of Heaven above, the human realm, the heavenly paradises, the Buddha-lands, the dragon palaces, and the oceanic treasuries?

Now, the *Primordial Beginning* has two precious pearls. The *Scripture of Salvation* says: *"The Primordial Beginning, in the Great Floating Li Land of the Void, suspended a precious pearl, large as a grain of millet. The Primordial Beginning ascended first, followed by the perfected immortals, all entering the pearl’s mouth, never to be seen again."* From this, though the pearl is small, it contains multitudes—how so? The Buddhist teachings speak of *Mount Sumeru fitting into a mustard seed*, of *buddha-lands within a mote of dust*, of *armies clashing on a snail’s horn*. Master Zhu said: *"That which is great has no exterior; that which is small has no interior."* The *Treasure Tower* of *Good Wealth* revealed Maitreya, adorned with countless treasures; yet upon awakening to true enlightenment, all that wealth was found within the pores of Samantabhadra’s body. Vimalakīrti’s room held thirty-two thousand lion thrones. The *Jade Emperor Scripture* says: *"In the heavenly palaces of the ten directions, the Celestial Thearch manifests dharma-bodies to expound the teachings; when the teaching concludes, all return to oneness."* Why should great and small differ, or division and unity be distinct?

Thus, when scattered, it fills the Six Voids; when gathered, it does not fill a handful. The ancients said: *"Reading the entire *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* is not as good as contemplating a single *Gen* hexagram of the *Book of Changes*."* Truly so. When one gathers and restrains the true origin, abiding in stillness, then the myriad things of Heaven and Earth array themselves before one. As *Laozi* says: *"Attain utmost emptiness, abide in profound stillness—then the ten thousand things arise together."* A mote of dust can contain the celestial image; a single truth can respond to ten thousand directions. The vastness of the Six Directions is insufficient to contain one’s body, yet a mustard seed is ample for one’s wanderings.

This *Precious Pearl* is also called *Canghu Jie*, *Perfect Enlightenment*, *Wish-Fulfilling Wheel*, and *Round as a Golden Pellet*, its color like a red tangerine—all names imposed by the sages to guide the unenlightened. Once the fish and rabbit are caught, the trap and snare should be discarded.

Its radiance flows, illuminating the form.

The Dao is not far from humanity, yet people are often admonished with the saying *"to hew a handle"* (learning by analogy). *"Humans can enlarge the Dao"*—one should first reflect on oneself. What is within will manifest without. Thus, one’s brilliance shines forth, the body gleaming with clarity, as it is said: *"Seen on the face, overflowing on the back."* Though hidden, it is as evident as Confucius’ teachings. The subtle becomes manifest; sincerity cannot be concealed. Thus, one who values the Dao, purifies the self, avoids worldly entanglements, conceals traces, and veils light—though seeking no recognition—will naturally be known; though desiring no visibility—will naturally be seen. This is the *flourishing virtue*.

The title is called *Longevity, Ease, and Abundance*—*Longevity, Ease, and Abundance* being the name of the essence of the sun. Within the human body, the radiance of spirit and vitality naturally bestows longevity. As the sutra states: *"If one clings to the notions of self, others, beings, or lifespan, one is no bodhisattva."* Generally speaking, this "longevity" is not the longevity of the mortal world. Humans may live a hundred years, yet those who reach seventy are rare—how can this be called longevity? With such limited understanding, how could one recognize the original, eternal, and indestructible *longevity-nature*? This *longevity-nature* fills heaven and earth, its measure equal to the cosmos, shared with all things and one with all beings. It stands resplendent, vast and unbounded—how could it be confined by numbers or constraints? It is also called *Pavilion of Clarifying the Source*.

To ascend to heights, one must begin from below; to climb a mound, one must start from the plain. This also refers to the division of the left and right eyes. *Pavilion of Clarifying the Source* is the name of the Moon Sovereign, for when the source is clear, its flow is pure. The *pavilion*, in ancient script, resembles a tower or terrace, where immortals gather and abide.

Together, extinguish the mechanisms of the Three Evils. The Three Evils are greed, hatred, and delusion. One who severs these will not fall into the Three Evil Realms and may behold the Three Treasures and Heavenly Lords. *Mechanism* refers to the subtlest movement, upon which fortune, misfortune, regret, and shame depend. Thus, the noble person acts upon perceiving the mechanism, not waiting until the day’s end. The Three Evil Realms are hell, hungry ghosts, and animals—these are the most yin places, from which regaining a human form is difficult. Therefore, one cultivates pure yang to extinguish their pivot. As the scripture says: *"Pray to extinguish the Three Evils, sever the root of earthly bonds."* The same principle applies: the noble person is cautious and vigilant even where unseen, naturally extinguishing the mechanisms of evil.

Open the register and ascend to *Great Clarity*. *Great Clarity* refers to the illumination of the four eyes—some say *Supreme Clarity*, but this is incorrect. Kan-water forever separates one from the realm of Li’s direct illumination. Thus, the sage faces south to rectify the world. The Jade Emperor resides in the *Palace of Pervading Clarity*. When one ascends as an immortal, the celestial register is revealed, and one’s name is inscribed before paying homage to the Jade Emperor. Later, it is said: *"Holding the register, ascend to Great Clarity."* This metaphorically means that for humans, illuminating one’s virtue is paramount. When one’s inherent power is clear and unobscured by sensual desires, one becomes a person of *Great Clarity*—a sage, a true immortal—all of whom take the preservation of their luminous nature as their duty.

Let me safeguard the immortal truth. Only after heaven and earth exist do the myriad things arise. What fills the space between heaven and earth are the myriad things, and among them, none is more spiritually endowed than humans. Yet, failing to cultivate and examine themselves, they fall into the Three Evil Realms. Through the practice of the *Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals*, one extinguishes these mechanisms and ascends to *Great Clarity*, thereby safeguarding the immortal truth. Some versions say *"enable you to safeguard the immortal truth"*—when a superior addresses a subordinate, it is *"enable you"*; when a subordinate addresses a superior, it is *"let me"*—both are acceptable without harming the meaning. To safeguard one’s own true qi is essential for immortality; one cannot rely on others to preserve it for them.

The immortal sash drapes in emerald green. The Jade Emperor bestows a sash of azure and purple, allowing the adept to wear it when paying homage—a process called *"selecting immortals and recommending scholars."* It is akin to passing the imperial examination in the mortal world, where one is first granted a green robe. In the following passage, it is said: *"Draped in crimson, amidst the green mist"*—both refer to immortal garments.

Dissolve misfortune on the dark paths. Once inscribed in the immortal register, misfortune sinks into the nine depths of the underworld’s shadowy paths. In the mortal world, obtaining an official position brings honor to one’s wife and children, extending blessings to one’s clan—this is but fleeting glory. How much more noble is one who embodies emptiness and tranquility!

Surpass blessings in the morning’s radiance. The officials of the dharma can resolve doubts and disputes. Though they lack cultivation, upon death, they become yin ghosts and are appointed as yin officials, rotating every forty-nine years—a fate shared by all. If one nurtures both inner and outer, cultivating both fortune and wisdom, one attains the immortal Dao. With one’s own true spirit, one receives blessings in the luminous morning above, enjoying boundless joy and freedom.

The term *morning* appears eleven times in various contexts: *"Roaming the golden dawn of the celestial morning," "The sun transforms into three mornings," "The yellow radiance of the morning’s qi," "The high morning reflects Upper Clarity," "Riding the morning’s splendor," "The seven mornings return to the Emperor’s seat," "Jade gates reflect the morning mist," "Surpassing blessings in the morning’s radiance,"* and *"Feathered immortals in the moonlit morning," "Ascending the Hall of Vast Spirit in the morning," "Entering the Chamber of the Heavenly Elder in the morning."* These cannot be uniformly interpreted but must be explained according to the scriptural context. Those who have not studied the canon but rely on transmitted texts to arbitrarily alter the classics are fools who should fear the inescapable karmic retribution—how can they not be warned and cautioned?

Transcend the world and ascend to the Jade Realm. Passing beyond the dust of kalpas, one enters the Jade Realm. Jade symbolizes warmth and harmony. The realm of the Great Yang Dao knows no suffering from heat or cold, where the four seasons are as mild as spring’s qi—thus it is called the *Jade Realm of Great Purity*, where no sun or moon exists, and so there is no day or night, no cold or heat.

The ancestors of countless generations return as infants. The ancestors of past lives—forefathers, grandfathers, and beyond—return to the womb and are reborn in the form of infants. This is called the *Great Cavern Emperor’s* manifestation among humans. Some argue that since these ancestors bear no karmic burden, there is no need for salvation. Yet this scripture provides salvation in sixteen instances, demonstrating that only when one’s thoughts are constantly directed toward elevating one’s ancestors—forefathers, grandfathers, and beyond—is one permitted to ascend oneself. The intent of the Heavenly King is profound indeed!

Here, I categorize them as follows: *"Liberating the roots of the seven ancestors," "Dissolving the accumulated corpses of the seven ancestors," "Breaking the blockages of the seven ancestors," "Returning the seven ancestors as infant immortals," "Severing the dark stagnation of the seven ancestors," "Dispersing the accumulated stagnation of the seven ancestors," "Birthing the seven ancestors in the Hall of Fortune," "Untying the knots to birth the seven ancestors," "The seven mysteries ascend to the Crimson Palace," "The seven mysteries depart the dark burdens," "Dispersing misfortune to pacify the nine mysteries," "The nine mysteries dissolve heavy knots," "Western liberation from accumulated kalpas of misfortune," "The ancestors of countless generations return as infants,"* and *"The ancestors of countless generations shed their karmic names."* These correspond to the *Scripture of Salvation’s* *"Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties,"* *"Ascension of the Seven Ancestors,"* and *"Deliverance of Souls to the Crimson Mound."*

It is also said: *"For the departed souls of past lives, sever the bonds of earthly servitude."* Those who seek the immortal Dao must first purify body and mind. Purity means being unstained and unattached, neither increasing nor decreasing. Only when one is pure can one perform meritorious deeds, moving heaven and earth to liberate ancestors, broadly delivering all beings, and only then can one deliver oneself—thus feeling no shame.

Within the boundless void of penetrating vision—
*"Penetrating"* means "unobstructed," referring to the ten wondrous practices of perfect clarity. When observed through the mundane eye (read in level tone), or inwardly perceived with mind and gaze (read in departing tone), one gazes upward to the Nine Heavens and downward to the Nine Earths. The middle scroll’s ten chapters are called the *Ten Penetrations*; this is the title of the *Great Penetration*. Thus:

*Penetrating vision in the unobstructed void,*
*Penetrating subtlety in the barrierless mystery,*
*Penetrating emptiness in pure clarity,*
*Penetrating vacuity in serene harmony,*
*Penetrating numen in pure conduct,*
*Penetrating truth in the immaculate body,*
*Penetrating mystery in pure radiance,*
*Penetrating origin in pure light,*
*Penetrating illumination in pure brilliance,*
*Penetrating clarity in dark wisdom—*

These are the *Ten Great Penetrations*, wherein wondrous practice and wondrous fruition reach perfection. Only then does the initial clarity of *hetu-pratyaya* arise.

The *Book of Changes* states: *"Suspended images manifest brightness—none greater than the sun and moon."* As the sun departs and the moon returns, cold and heat arise. Without sun and moon, the Dao’s principles remain unseen; without them, heaven would be an endless night. Thus the character *ming* (明, "brightness") is composed of *ri* (日, "sun") and *yue* (月, "moon"). When the Dao-eye first opens, nothing escapes its sight—even a speck of dust as fine as an autumn hair cannot elude it.

The scripture says: *"The sacred sun and sacred moon illumine the Golden Court."* It is also said: *"The sage combines the brightness of sun and moon."* The great person is inwardly luminous yet outwardly dim, while the common person is inwardly dim yet outwardly bright—thus swayed by circumstances and things.

The *Luminous Pearl in the Black Dragon’s Jaw*—
The sage possesses square pupils; Shun had double pupils. When the human Dao-eye first opens, it is like the pearl beneath the black dragon’s chin—lucid, translucent, and resplendent. For one of thorough attainment, the entire body becomes an eye and hand; wherever touched, it is as if the Thousand-Handed Avalokiteśvara responds.

*Within and without, penetrating illumination and clarity—*
Inside and out, all is brightly revealed, pure and unobstructed—this is heaven’s mirror bestowed upon one. Those who cultivate the *Great Penetration* may gaze upward to the Nine Heavens above and peer downward to the Nine Earths below, comprehending the principles of all things without the slightest concealment.

The *Great Penetration’s* golden elixir requires the gathering of lead and mercury. As the ancients said: *"At the pool’s bottom, the sun’s red glow dispels yin demons; lead is the mountain’s yang qi, the moon’s white medicine sprouts anew; mercury is yang essence."* When yang returns to yang, both eyes become like golden stars, capable of penetrating the Way of day and night. By day, the left eye is used; by night, the right—thus substituting for the brightness of sun and moon.

The above jade verse in celestial script comprises one hundred twenty characters. Above, it governs the *Luminous Ancestral Heaven of Radiant Brilliance*; below, it commands the *Third Tier’s Emperor of Virtue*.

The *Mysterious Covenant* states: *"When the perfected attain penetrating vision and pure clarity, the Dao-eye first opens—unobstructed and barrierless, inwardly and outwardly luminous, perceiving all. They can sever the evil roots of Fengdu Mountain’s *Zhoujue Yintian* Palace, the earthly roots, demonic registers, and ghostly ledgers. Constantly offering celestial blossoms and wafting incense to the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning—who is none other than one’s own indestructible primordial spirit through kalpas, not externally derived—scattering flowers and wafting fragrance, they ascend to the rank of *Human Immortal*."*

The middle scroll’s *Ten Immortals* refer to the *embryo, womb, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, numen, origin, radiance, Mount Hua, viscera, and primordial destiny*. From the first month’s formation of the embryo, they develop in sequence, eventually entering the *Ten Immortal Gates*—as annotated beneath the *Ten Perfected* of the *Subtle Practice of the Mind-Organ* in the middle scroll. Few practitioners may comprehend this, so here, from the *Books of Cultivating Truth*, the *Ten Immortals* are expounded for benefit.

The *Human Immortal* is one whose lifespan exceeds a hundred years, having witnessed countless human generations—such as Laozi at nine hundred years or Peng Zu at eight hundred.

The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning states: *"The twelfth jade chapter of the *Great Penetration of Wenchang*—the ear-root’s penetrating clarity, the sage’s ear attuned to the Brahmā-sound."* [Cyclical years:] *Dingyou, Wuxu, Kui, and Sai.*

The Jade Dawn’s Nine Heavens Controller governs the ear-root—merely hearing sounds, the numinous clarity is stirred, turning with the sound toward good or evil. In an instant, they diverge; a hair’s breadth of difference leads to a thousand *li* of error. Thus, Shun delighted in questioning and examining, Yu heeded good words, Robber Zhi rejoiced in hearing evil, and King Zhou took pleasure in sounds—all through the ear’s listening.

Once, a monk sat in meditation when a crow cawed above him. Someone asked, *"Did you hear it?"* The monk replied, *"I did not hear."* *"Why did you not hear?"* *"Within hearing, there was no hearing."* From this, we see that hearing is not truly unhearing—only that the mind does not cling to it.

The Jade Clarity Numinous Treasure resides above the Nine Heavens. The Nine Heavens comprise three, for from the One *qi* arise the Three *qi*—these are the Three Treasures. From the Three *qi* arise the Nine *qi*—these are the Nine Heavens, the heavens that generate spirits, such as the *Yudan Immeasurable Heaven*. There are also the Eight Brahmā and Nine Heavens: the *Beginning Azure Heaven*, *Great Azure Heaven*, *Beginning Cinnabar Heaven*, *Great Cinnabar Heaven*, *Beginning Plain Heaven*, *Great Plain Heaven*, *Beginning Mysterious Heaven*, *Great Mysterious Heaven*, and *Great Brahmā Heaven*—these too are called the Nine Heavens.

It is also said: the *Exalted Divine Numinous Heaven*. The *South Pole Lord of Longevity*, the *East Pole Lord of Azure Florescence*, the *Nine Heavens Responsive Primordial Thunder Voice Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy*, the *Nine Heavens Thunder Ancestor Great Emperor*, the *Highest Clarity Purple Tenuity Azure Jade Palace Great Unity Heavenly Emperor*, the *Six Heavens Cavern Abyss Great Emperor*, the *Lord Emperor of the Six Waves Heaven*, and the *Perfected Lord Han of Kě, Nine Heavens Investigator*—these are the Nine Numinous of the Divine Numinous Heaven, wielding the power of life and death, issuing commands, thunder roaring and wind rushing. Thus, the myriad things arise and conclude through them. The *Jade Clarity Dao Lord* presides over them, residing in the human Central Elixir Field.

The *Supreme Great Dao Lord*—the *Dao Lord* is a lord of the Dao. Long ago, the Numinous Treasure descended to be born as the king of *Xina*, bringing great peace to the realm. The people praised him as *"possessing the Dao."* *Dao* means *"to tread"*—who can exit without passing through the door? What can be done without following this Way? It encompasses the affairs of *"illuminating virtue and renewing the people,"* extending from one’s family to the state and thence to the world, all capable of emulation from above to below.

*Laozi* said: *"Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes true; extend it to the world, and it becomes universal."* *The Doctrine of the Mean* said: *"The Way is not far from man."* If one practices the Way yet distances oneself from others, it cannot be called the Way. The great affairs of *"cultivating the self, regulating the family, governing the state, and pacifying the world"*—how can they not proceed from rectifying the self and sincerely aligning the mind, then pacifying and governing the world?

Thus, the man of the Dao devotes himself to benefiting the world and aiding others. When Jie and Zhou were without the Way, the people suffered calamity. Kings Wen and Tang of Zhou rescued the people from water and fire, relieving their inverted-hanging distress. Later generations praised them as lords of the Way.

**Constantly Preserve the Radiant Transformation Within**
The *Jade Scripture* states: *"If the Son of Heaven, kings, or lords uphold it, their states will attain great peace—wealth will enrich the nation, the people will be secure, the army will be strong and victorious, and externally, there will be no harassment from bandits or thieves. The altars of soil and grain will be eternally preserved."* Reciting this scripture is especially for the sovereign, ministers, fathers, and sons to stabilize the land, ensuring the heavens endure long. It is likened to a person whose essence and *qi* are replete, the body robust and strong, free from the encroachment of perverse *qi*, naturally preserving longevity and health. Thus, one preserves within the radiant transformation of creation, preventing its loss or the disturbance of one’s supreme Way by external perversities, the corruption of one’s numinous root, or the theft of one’s supreme treasure. This is *"preserving the radiant transformation."*

**Nine Revolutions, Mirror-Clear**
Nine and ten unite like a mirror’s clarity, penetratingly perceiving all things. The *Jade Emperor Scripture* says: *"Corrupting the numinous root, stealing the supreme treasure"*—this is the failure to preserve the radiant transformation, leading to a mirror that is not empty and a scale that is not level.

Long ago, Chen Yuming attained the Way of the Bright Mirror. After eighteen years of cultivation, he ascended on the first day of the third month in the first year of the *Taikang* era of Jin. During the *Taikang* era, a villager from Xinye, Master Zhang Ruzhen, encountered a divine person descending into his chamber, who transmitted the Way of the *Bright Mirror Penetrating Insight*, saying: *"That which illuminates the principles of things is Heaven; that which reflects the forms of things is the Way. Heaven’s Way is clear; the mirror’s Way is bright. Scrutinized without error, form is fixed here, and things respond there—thus, the shapes of rivers and mountains, the dispositions of ghosts and spirits, have nowhere to hide."*

*"Heaven, through clarity, contains the myriad existences; water, through stillness, reflects all forms. If Heaven is clear and the mirror bright, the mind still and the spirit tranquil, one attains inner and outer penetration—then the supreme Way is achieved. But if externally enslaved by things and internally wearied in spirit, the mind and spirit grow turbid and cannot be stilled, one drifts far from the Way."*

*"This method I received from Lord Changsang; Lord Changsang received it from the Supreme Clarity Heavenly Emperor. If you cultivate it, you will penetrate the mysterious and communicate with the distant, illuminating the eight extremities. Within the *Cavern Reality* methods, there is the Way of the Four Regulations, practiced according to the four seasons—it is the same as this."*

*"The ancients said: 'Empty the chamber, and whiteness arises of itself; settle the mind, and the Way forms of itself.' How true!"* After nine years of cultivation, Ruzhen could see a thousand *li* without a single thing concealed. On the eighteenth day of the eleventh month in the thirteenth year of the *Tianjian* era of Liang, he ascended, styled *Perfected of Complete Truth and Attained Way*. This is the purport of *"Nine Revolutions, Mirror-Clear."*

Each sentence of this scripture governs one affair. If a person practices one sentence, they unite with the Dao and become a perfected one.

**Unbinding the Jade’s Luster in the Chamber**
The *Jade Luster Chamber* is the *Highest Clarity Jade Clarity Palace*, located in the human Central Elixir Field. When the knots of the spirit-chamber are unbound, it shines like jade’s radiance. The *Book of Songs* says: *"Though in your chamber, be not ashamed before the leaking roof"*—fearing even that which is unheard.

**Riding the Plain to Enter the Fourfold Illumination**

Plain is emptiness; as the ear is to sound, so riding the plain and emptiness reaches the fourfold acuity. The *Lung Metropolis Lad* is styled *Plain Illuminer* and *Nameless Flower*—illumination arises from the union of sun and moon, and those who first fashioned written characters knew the workings of creation. **Carrying and Lifting the King Within the Sun**: The *Life-Commanding Lord Within the Sun*, styled *Dao-Spirit*, is carried and lifted without a moment’s abandonment. All references to “sun” in ten phrases—*Five Suns Merged in the Chamber*, *Three Suns Shining on Dark Spread*, *One Pearl Revolving Within the Sun*, *Sun as the Threefold Convergence*, *Five Emperors Scattering Sun-Essence*, *Life-Commanding Lad Within the Sun*, *Sun Unfolding Fivefold Radiance*, *Primal Transformation Unlocking Tomorrow’s Sun*, *Flying Rosy Clouds Dispersing Heaven’s Sun*, *Sea-Sun Rising of Itself in the East*—all denote the true numen of the sun, the essence of Grand Yang. In humans, this is the yang within the *Kan* trigram, the single luminous point between the two kidneys, the *King Within the Sun*, established at the *zi* hour of life-generation. **Joining Wings in the Moon’s Dawn**: The two ears divide yin and yang, hence the *King Within the Sun* and the *Dawn Within the Moon*. As in the *True Formula of Yuji and Jielin* by Ancestral Celestial Master, both govern the spirits of sun and moon. *Carrying and Lifting, Joining Wings* means to constantly lift, reflect, and connect without dullness. Formerly, Master Chen and Yang Taichu encountered the Perfected One Nie Shaoyuan, who transmitted the *High Ascent of the Two Effulgences*, and later attained the Dao and ascended. The *Ancient Poem* says:

*The sage seizes the intent of creation,*
*Grasping sun and moon to set within the furnace.*
*Subtly stirring heaven and earth’s essence,*
*Gathering yin and yang to drive gods and ghosts.*

It also says:

*If you ask me of the practice in the world,*
*I point afar to the sun and moon’s wheel.*

And again:

*When sun and moon unite,*
*There lies the birthplace of the body.*
*The original face is true—*
*I urge you to diligently reflect.*

The Scripture says: *Sacred Sun and Sacred Moon illuminate the Golden Court.* The union of sun and moon is their conjunction on the night of the dark moon—inner elixir is refined and conjoined here. **Grand Unity Summons Heavenly Demons**: As briefly explained in the previous scroll, Grand Unity is the qi transformed from the essence of Water Prime. Before heaven and earth, the number One generates Water to form images; before human birth, the essence of the One Qi is sensed and transformed to form the body. Without Water, heaven and earth cannot stand; without essence and qi, the human body cannot stand. *Laozi* says: *Heaven obtains the One and becomes clear; Earth obtains the One and becomes tranquil; spirits obtain the One and become numinous; the myriad things obtain the One and live.* Thus Grand Unity is the ancestral lord of the myriad spirits, and so can wield talismans to summon and control the great demons of the Six Heavens. In the *Scripture of the Great Cavern*, references to Grand Unity number ten: in the upper scroll, *Grand Unity as the Root of Life’s Mandate*, *Grand Unity Residing in the Purple Chamber*; in the middle scroll, *Grand Unity Summons Heavenly Demons*, *Carrying and Lifting the True Grand Unity*; in the lower scroll, *Grand Unity’s Upper Prime Qi*, *Grand Unity’s Chouqiu Lan*, *Grand Unity’s Yang-Wei Illuminator*, *Lifting the Female Grand Unity*, *Feathered Regalia Commanding Grand Unity*, *Grand Unity as King Within the Effulgence*, and so on. The spirit of Grand Unity unites the Five Spirits into one, and thus the Five Viscera each have their Grand Unity—just as there is no place between heaven and earth without water. In the Great Dao, it is called *Grand Unity Heavenly Venerable*; among the various heavens, *Grand Unity Emperor Lord*; within the Nine Heavens, *Jade Palace Grand Unity Great Heavenly Emperor*, who specially governs Water affairs. In the Dipper, it is called *Grand Unity*; in the Five Fortunes and various earthly realms, *Grand Unity Venerable Spirit*; among the Female Unity Perfected, *Grand Unity Primordial Lady*; in humans, *Grand Unity’s Spirit*—there is nowhere it is not present. Grand Unity resides in the human brain. For human transgressions and blessings, minor matters are reviewed and reported to the Emperor by Grand Unity; greater matters are reported by the Three Corpses; the gravest are recorded by the Three Officials. Thus Grand Unity is the leader of human spirits. Obtain the One, and all affairs are complete. Confucius said: *My Way is threaded through with the One.* Humans obtain the One and live; having already lived, if one can again guard the One, then this Way greatly illumines. Upon completion and wholeness, where is the One? Those who understand should devote their hearts to this. A monk asked: *The myriad dharmas return to the One; where does the One return?* The *Elixir Scripture* says: *Upon reaching completion, even the One is absent*—this urges people to have no attachments. To seek fish and hare, one must rely on traps and snares; once fish and hare are obtained, traps and snares may be discarded. It also says: *To cross the river, one needs a raft; upon reaching the shore, the boat is no longer needed.* The Buddha taught: *Act without abiding, and thereby give rise to the mind.* **The Emperor Lord Surveys the Myriad Essences**: The Emperor Lord, also named *Sevenfold Numen* and *Fengling Fan*, constantly guards above the two brows, wielding talismans and registers to summon and control the great demons of the Six Heavens. The *Golden Book* says: *Grand Unity wields talismans; the Emperor Lord ranks lives*—these are the two Perfected. **Uprooting and Blocking the Qi of Death’s Accumulation**: The *Minor Scripture of Salvation from Suffering* says: *Auspicious smoke seals the gate of death.* The demon kings inspect and survey ghostly essences, blocking the gate of death to protect and recommend immortals. The *Chapter on Generating the Spirit* says: *The Primordial Lady blocks the gate of death.* This is the root of life’s mandate for endless generation. **Transcending the Immortal Yellow Court**: The Yellow Court is the Central Immortal Court, toward which the four directions and eight faces pay homage. In humans, it is the spleen and stomach, governing the Granary Palace. Its spirit is called *Yellow Tranquility Lad*, who disperses and transforms to nourish the Four Numinous Ones. Thus transcending this court is to establish the Three Passes. **The Emperor Stands Above the Three Passes**: The Three Passes are Heaven, Earth, and Water—also Heaven, Earth, and Human. The Upper Pass is the *Muddy Pellet*; the Middle Pass, the *Crimson Palace*; the Lower Pass, the *Sea of Qi*. They are also called the Three Essentials. In the *Book of Changes*, this is the Way of the Three Ultimates. The *Yellow Court* says: *Within the Three Passes are essence, qi, and spirit.* **The Eight Winds Dance the Spirit-Soldiers**: *Zhuangzi* says: *You have heard the Heavenly Flute, but not the Earthly Flute; you have heard the Earthly Flute, but not the Human Flute.* The Eight Winds are the spirit-qi of the eight directions. When the four cardinal and four intermediate directions all arise in harmonious thought, the thousand Perfected and myriad Sages rejoice and dance. When the qi of the human body flows smoothly, the myriad spirits are delighted.

When qi is even slightly disharmonious or a single pulse irregular, the human spirit weeps in sorrow. When the human spirit weeps, it will soon depart the body; when spirit departs and qi is cut off, the person perishes—how could one not be vigilant?

This is the method of the Eight Gates Flying Heavenly Wheel, which circulates essence and qi. On the left, embrace the *Blessed Nectar*: the *Blessed Nectar* is fragrant, exquisite wine, also called *Jade Liquid* or *Elixir of Immortality*. It is the qi-fluid of the entire body, irrigating the root source of the kidneys. Kidney qi ascends to the ears; though the two kidneys reside below, their gate lies above, so when the lower is full, the upper hears with clarity. The *Blessed Nectar* is also called *quicksilver*, *divine water*, *wood-fluid*, *Black Tortoise essence*, *Red Phoenix marrow*, *golden liquid*, *golden flower*, *jade pool*, *golden essence*, and *lead-mercury*—all alternate names for the ingredients of the elixir. Cherish essence to nourish qi, cherish qi to nourish spirit, cherish spirit to nourish emptiness, and the Way of the *Great Cavern* is complete.

On the right, lift the *Vessel of Auspicious Origin*. The *Vessel of Auspicious Origin* is called the *Jade Pool*, *Flowery Pool*, *Recumbent Moon Crucible*, *Suspended Womb Cauldron*, *Mysterious Gate*, *Female Portal*, *Yellow Court*, *True Earth*, and *Golden Tripod*—all implements of the elixir chamber. Neither can be lacking; thus the Dao of the elixir is perfected.

*Penetrating the Subtle without Obstruction*—
Hearing the hidden and minute without hindrance, for *penetrating the subtle* is the wondrous fruit and practice of the sage’s ear. This is one of the Six Penetrations. Through cultivation, one may hear beyond the Nine Heavens and below the Nine Earths.

*Brahmā-Permeation gives rise to Empty Clarity*—
*Empty Clarity* is the heart. From sincerity comes clarity—this is nature. The heart is the dwelling of nature. Attaining the nature of sincerity and clarity, one naturally sees with clarity and hears with acuity. *Brahmā-Permeation* is the sage’s ear, hearing all without exception, no sound escaping it.

*Piercing the Forehead to Hear the Ten Directions*—
The *forehead* is the brow. Above, it reaches the round crown; below, it encompasses the four quarters—nothing is not thoroughly penetrated. The *Ten Directions* are the four cardinal, four intermediate, above, and below—ten in all. When one’s *Brahmā-Permeation* and *Empty Clarity* pervade above and below, the four quarters, nothing is not heard with perfect clarity.

*All Sounds are Liberated*—
Every sound, great or small, resounds clearly, none escaping keen hearing. For like responds to like—there is nowhere one does not hear. Yet the deaf, though thunder shakes the mountains, remain unaware. How could one easily restore their original nature?

When the six roots and six dusts are all purified, one may wield the Six Spiritual Penetrations and attain great freedom. The ear root is governed by the kidneys, but often shaken by sensual desire, dissipating essence and qi, leading early to deafness. One must rely on the *Great Cavern* to summon the true and invoke the numinous, returning to spirit and clarity, dredging and opening the channels to restore the original body. Only then can one realize the wondrous practice of *penetrating the subtle*.

The above jade script of celestial seal, one hundred characters in all, governs above the *Zhuluo Huangjia Heaven* and commands below the *Third Rampart’s Emperor of Virtue*.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: When the perfected attain *penetrating the subtle* and purity, the sage’s ear and *Brahmā-Permeation* become unimpeded, inwardly and outwardly empty and bright, hearing all sounds. They can sever the roots of evil in the *Fengdu Mountain*, the *Tai Sha Liang Shi Zong Heavenly Palace*, and the demonic registers of *Di Gen*. Constantly offering elixir fruits to the *Primordial Heavenly King*, they bind the living kernel and ascend to become *Ghost Immortals*.

*Ghost Immortals* are those who, though the body dies, retain undimmed spirit, their presence evoking sorrowful longing and luminous clarity. They can bring fortune or misfortune to humans—such as the city gods, earth gods, *Guan Yu*, and *Zhang Fei* of today’s prefectures and counties.

*Jade Purity, Boundless, Supreme Perfected, Literary Florescence, Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals*, Scroll Five. ● *(One character appears to be missing here.)*

● *(This passage appears to contain textual errors.)* ● *(This passage contains textual corruption; the cited *Zhuangzi* "Qi Wu Lun" originally reads: "You have heard of the human pipes but not the earth pipes; you have heard of the earth pipes but not the heavenly pipes.")*

*The Jade Purity, Boundless, Supreme Perfected, Literary Florescence, Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals*, Scroll Six. Annotated by Zhongyangzi Wei Qi of Penglai Mountain in Eastern Shu.

The *Primordial Heavenly King* says: The thirteenth jade chapter of the *Great Cavern of Literary Florescence* states—
*"The nasal root penetrates the empty mystery; the subtle breath of qi flows through."*

*Jihai, Gengzi, Release, Diminution.*

The *Grand Purity* floats beyond the void. *Jade Purity, Highest Purity, Grand Purity*—these are the *Three Clarities*, situated above the *Great Veil* within the *Boundless*. Even celestial perfected sages rarely attain this realm, for nothing is more exalted or revered.

The lower scroll states: *"The Highest Purity ascends beyond the rosy clouds; the Jade Purity resides in the Palace of Ten Thousand Flowers."* The Buddhists speak of the *One Body with Three Aspects*: first *Vairocana*, then *Lokeshvara*, and third *Shakyamuni*. In humans, this corresponds to the *Upper, Middle, and Lower Primal* [elixir fields], all contained within a single body. These three cannot be separated even for a moment. The nose perceives fragrance, the heart craves its desires; the nasal cavity connects to the lungs, and the lungs govern qi, which is inevitably depleted.

Once, a monk in meditation detected the scent of *fragrant accumulations*. His mind thought, *"This must be a vegetarian offering."* At times, he saw celestial immortals inviting him to the heavenly kitchens. The monk would depart in samadhi and return daily. One day, his master observed him and said, *"You have fallen into a latrine."* The monk did not believe him. The master then instructed him to attend the offering again. Upon his return, the master killed a worm from the latrine, and the monk finally understood. From this, we see that the nose’s perception of fragrance can lead one to become a strange being—unlike *Xiangyan the Youth*, who, upon smelling incense, awakened to its origin and immediately attained fruition. The same fragrance of qi leads to delusion or enlightenment; one must be cautious.

The *Grand Purity* immortal realm floats within the void beyond the absolute, corresponding to humanity’s *Lower Primal* [elixir field]. This is called the *Primordial Ancestral Qi*. If one can preserve it, it is called the *Great Elixir*. When the returning wind merges with it, after a hundred days, spiritual communion is achieved. The *Lower Primal*—or *Lower Cinnabar Field*—is the *Sea of Qi*, the lifeline of the body, where spirit and qi gather. If one cherishes and nurtures it, not depleting it through lust and desire, the elixir will form.

*The Three Heavenly Treasure Talismans.*

The *Three Heavens*—*Pure Tenuity, Yu Yu, and Great Scarlet*—are the abodes of the *Three Treasure Lords*. The *Treasure Spirit Talismans* are the most revered of the *Great Cavern’s* sacred chapters, stabilizing heaven and earth. For humans, cherishing the *Three Fields* and revering the *spirit-qi* is essential to preserving form and life.

*"At midday, the Five Radiance open."*

At noon, the *Spirit Youth of the Controller of Destiny* unfolds the chambers of the *Five Spirits*, their luminous brilliance illuminating heaven and earth. This is like the human heart’s spirit—radiant and resplendent, shining through the *Three Fields*, the five viscera, the hundred meridians, and the nine orifices, leaving nothing unseen.

*"The Azure Emperor abides in eternal roundlessness."*

The East belongs to Wood, governed by the *Azure Emperor*. *"Eternal Roundlessness"* is his name. Liver qi ascends to the East, the domain of Jupiter’s influence, protecting the liver and guarding the hun-soul within the *Eight Darknesses*. Humans and all beings equally partake of this qi.

*"Bearing the register, ascending to Great Brilliance."*

The *Great Cavern of Literary Florescence* contains similar passages. The first chapter states: *"Open the register, ascend to Great Brilliance."* Now, *Great Brilliance* emerges from the East, so the *Azure Emperor*, riding the light, bears the immortal register to the *Hall of Great Brilliance* of the *Jade Emperor* to present and review it.

*"Receive the talisman in the Golden Flower Tower."*

Having ascended as an immortal, one must reverently receive the sacred talisman in the *Golden Flower Tower* to enter the celestial register. The *Golden Flower Tower* is the *Twelvefold Tower of the Lungs*, for the nasal qi descends to the lung palace, and lung qi naturally rises from the *Tower*.

*"The five viscera plant jade roots."*

The nose’s perception of odors, when aligned with correctness, harmonizes the five viscera. Heaven’s five phases each possess their roots, and the human five viscera likewise have theirs. Jade is likened to virtue for its warmth and luster. When the root is warm and lustrous, branches and leaves flourish; when the five viscera are warm and lustrous, spirit and essence manifest externally.

*Wang Shuhe’s* *Classic of the Pulse* states: *"The wise can harmonize the five viscera."* The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: *"The nasal spirit, Jade Ridge, is numinous and firm."* The nose is also called the *Mountain Root*, derived from this principle. The upper scroll mentions the *Five Elders assisting the Jade Root*—the *Five Elders* being the spirits of the five viscera, mutually illuminating for clarity.

*"The hun and po likewise congeal in harmony."*

The Scripture states: *"Return the qi of the Upper Heaven to restrain the nine heavenly hun."* The yang-hun is spirit; the yin-po is ghost. Without harmonious qi to bind them, they diverge. In humans, when yin and yang harmonize, the hun congeals and the po gathers, giving life. When yin and yang separate, the hun ascends as spirit, and the po descends as ghost.

The *Book of Changes* says: *"Essence and qi become things; the wandering hun undergoes transformation."* Thus, we know the conditions of ghosts and spirits. On the left are the *Three Hun*; on the right, the *Seven Po*. When each rests in its proper place, they naturally congeal, and their qi flows smoothly through the four limbs. Spirit, essence, hun, po, and intent are the mother of the *Great Elixir*. Is this not why the *Scripture of Salvation* instructs that reciting this scripture on one’s *life-day* results in the hun-spirit becoming pure and upright?

The *Elixir Scripture* states: *"The sun’s hun and the moon’s po—if one recognizes them, one becomes an immortal."* Refine and ingest them for a thousand days, and the body, free of yin, cannot die. The adept should refine the yin-po to assist the yang-hun, making ascension effortless.

*"The empty cavern is pure and mysterious."*

Within the empty cavern, nothing external—no speck of dust—can enter, and nothing internal—no spirit or qi—can escape. Thus, it congeals in purity, mysterious beyond mystery.

The *empty cavern* is the wondrous practice of *nasal contemplation*. One should keep the breath pure and still, untainted by fragrance or stench.

*"Qi flows, giving rise to luminous clarity."*

Among the fragrant scents of myriad treasures, none is as penetrating as musk from the brain. Yet, being an external substance, it is inferior to one’s own *Fivefold True Fragrance*, which, when cultivated, manifests as *non-action and natural purity*. Even this is surpassed by the *subtle, liberated, natural fragrance* perceived by the *Night-Glow Jade Maiden*, which is the most sublime.

In humans, lung qi ascends to the nose, becoming pure and undefiled, free from admixture. Practicing the *True Way of the Imperial Unity of the Great Cavern* to this point, the fragrant qi pervades all, penetrating above and below without exception. All who perceive this fragrance attain liberation.

Stillness and wondrous luminous awareness—once stabilized, it remains unchanging. When harmony pervades the realm of wondrous luminous awareness, the mind of luminous clarity naturally receives the qi of Great Harmony. The dung beetle rolling its ball and the tortoise drawing in qi both attain transcendence—thus does the Buddhist teaching speak of the "wondrous realm of Perfect Awakening" as one with this.

Mysterious breath naturally engenders longevity. The bearing of Highest Heaven is soundless and scentless—how could it be sought through voices, colors, smiles, or appearances? One must strive for utter silence and absence of perception, and true hearing will naturally arise. The Way of nasal contemplation is vast; it is called *embryonic breathing*. The methods of embryonic breathing taught by the various immortals often involve placing a goose feather at the tip of the nose to count the breaths as qi enters and exits—from one to ten, ten to a hundred, a hundred to a thousand, a thousand to ten thousand—until the breath becomes so stabilized that it neither comes nor goes. Some sit at the bottom of deep abysses for days without emerging, thereby forever banishing hunger, thirst, cold, and heat. Those who suffer from hunger, thirst, cold, and heat do so because their primordial qi exits too much and enters too little.

In former times, Xiao Linghu encountered a perfected one who transmitted the method of embryonic breathing. After practicing it, during the Mid-Autumn Festival of the second year of the *Hongdao* era, he underwent a mysterious transformation, his chamber filled with fragrant qi. Many later saw him—though dead, he was not gone. Is this not the Way of long life and enduring vision?

The above jade script of celestial seal, sixty characters in all, governs above the radiant heavens of the *Hall of Empty Clarity* and rules below the Fourth Rampart, moistening the earth and the *Earth Sovereign*. The *Mysterious Contract* states: When the true person attains the empty clarity of the Great Cavern and the mysterious breath flows unimpeded, without obstruction or hindrance, inner and outer become luminously clear. Fragrant qi suffuses the upright qi, pervading above and below, enabling the severing of the baleful qi of the *Mount Fengdu*, the serene illumination of the *Palace of Sinful Qi*, the roots of evil in the *Celestial Palace* and *Earthly Root*, and the demonic registers and ghostly ledgers. One should constantly offer incense of sincerity to the *Celestial King of Primordial Beginning*, emulate the great completion of *King Kui*, and ascend to become a *Water Immortal*.

The *Water Immortal* arises when one falls into water and sinks into the abyss, yet the hun and po do not scatter. Along the banks of rivers and marshes, they appear and disappear, vanish and manifest—such as Qu Yuan, Guo Pu, and Liu Yi. The *Celestial King of Primordial Beginning* said: The fourteenth jade scripture of the *Great Cavern of Wenchang* concerns the *hollow emptiness of the tongue-root*, the mysterious communication of the tongue’s blossom.

*Xinchou*, *Renyin*, *Yi*, *Guai*.

The *Celestial King of the Primordial Radiance of the Supreme Ultimate*:
Discoursing on the mysterious and expounding the Dao, engaging in ornate speech and reckless words, craving and indulging in flavors—all these pertain to the tongue. Thus, the tongue-root is most weighty, and what humans must cultivate. The *Book of Changes* says: "Words and deeds are the hinge and spring of the noble one." One should ensure that words match deeds and deeds match words, not excessively indulging in flavors. Serene magnanimity is supreme, and the true qi of Great Harmony will naturally descend to communicate with the *Crimson Palace*—for the heart connects to the tongue.

Before the Supreme Ultimate divided, the primordial radiance was in profound darkness; after its division, the primordial radiance became luminous. Thus is the primordial radiance honored as king. The scripture says: "The Three Luminaries of Opening Clarity are the root of heaven." Hence, the Supreme Ultimate is king, and every thing possesses a Supreme Ultimate.

The Three Heavens gather the spirit and engender life.
The Three Heavens are *Jade Clarity*, *Highest Clarity*, and *Great Clarity*. "Gathering the spirit and engendering life"—some say "spirit king," but this is incorrect. Only when the three qi harmonize in virtue and the nine qi align in unison is the spirit engendered. Highest Heaven has ten thousand spirits, and thus the human body also possesses ten thousand spirits.

The purple and plain obscure the towering peak.
The *Left Primordial Sovereign of Purple Simplicity*, *Ke Yi Yu Ren*, whose style is *An Lai Shang*, is also known by the alias *Wu Ying*—hence later referred to as *White Simplicity* and *White Primordial*. The qi of purple and plain obscures the towering peak—*ren* means the tip, the summit of a sharp peak. If one can maintain purity and simplicity in guarding the head, this qi will naturally cover it. The third chapter of the preceding upper section says: "Gazing upward to meet the peak without measure," referring to the *Mount Jade Capital*. These three plainnesses—later there is the *Middle Primordial Sovereign of Yellow Simplicity* and the *Right Primordial Sovereign of White Simplicity*—are called the *Three Elder Sovereigns of Simplicity*. The earlier and later passages mutually reveal their meanings, repeated for clarity and analogy.

*An Lai Shang* ascends the *Jade Capital*.
The style of the *Purple Simplicity Sovereign* is *An Lai Shang*, who meets at *Mount Jade Capital*. In the fifth chapter of the following lower section, the name above jade is identical in meaning. The *Celestial King of Primordial Radiance* gathers the hun and engenders the spirit—for *primordial* is the chief of goodness, thus the leader of all spirits.

Uprooting from the realm of the five sufferings:
The five flavors confuse the mouth. The five flavors—sour, bitter, sweet, pungent, salty—those who indulge in them shorten their lives and fall into the realm of the five sufferings. Having already ascended the *Jade Capital*, one must first excel and transcend the three paths and five sufferings. The first chapter of the upper section speaks of uprooting from the *Three Paths Bridge*; the tongue chapter of the middle section speaks of uprooting from the *Realm of Five Sufferings*; the hands and feet chapter speaks of uprooting from the *Five Poisonous Sufferings*; the nature and life chapter speaks of extinguishing the *Three Paths Corpses*; the essence and blood chapter speaks of severing the *Three Paths Sufferings*; the eighth chapter of the lower section speaks of removing the registers of the *Three Lower Paths*; the thirteenth chapter speaks of cutting off the *Three Paths Afflictions*.

The three paths are all errors—how can one change after long delay?
*Tu* means servitude. The *Heavenly Servitude* is tabooed as *Ke Han Ming*; the *Human Servitude* arises from the cycle of life and death; the *Earthly Servitude* involves solitary bondage and displacement. Sever the *Upper Corpse Path of the Heavenly Servitude* at the *Gate of Sensual Desire*, to avoid the servitude of the *Celestial Officials* driving thunder and chasing lightning. Sever the *Middle Corpse Path of the Earthly Servitude* at the *Gate of Love Desire*, to avoid the servitude of the *Earthly Officials* carrying sand and bearing stones. Sever the *Lower Corpse Path of the Human Servitude* at the *Gate of Greed Desire*, to avoid the servitude of the *Water Officials* endlessly drawing from the dark waves.

The five sufferings: Passing through the first, the *Gate of Suffering from Sensual Bondage*, frees one from the suffering of the *Mount Tai Hell*. Passing through the second, the *Gate of Suffering from Love Bondage*, frees one from the suffering of the *Wind Blade Hell*. Passing through the third, the *Gate of Suffering from Greed Bondage*, frees one from the suffering of carrying sand and bearing stones. Passing through the fourth, the *Gate of Suffering from Florid Competition*, frees one from the suffering of filling the sea and digging rivers. Passing through the fifth, the *Gate of Suffering from Bodily Bondage*, frees one from the suffering of swallowing fire, eating coals, and boiling in cauldrons.

In cultivating the *Great Cavern of Wenchang*, one must sever the three servitudes and transcend the five sufferings. The three and five together form the eight difficulties—this is what the upper scripture describes as transcending the five sufferings and eight difficulties.

Returning to the womb of the Seven Primordials’ courtyard.
The Seven Primordials are the *Water Pool*, the abode of the *Potter’s Po*. The *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* governs the netherworld and presides over the sources of water. Beneath the tongue, to the left is *Golden Fluid*, to the right is *Jade Humor*—these flow downward to irrigate the heart. The heart has seven apertures, corresponding to the seven stars of the Dipper.

The Nine Mysteries dissolve the weight of kalpas,
the Seven Mysteries and Nine Ancestors together release the suffering of accumulated kalpas and layered yin.
Cultivating the *Great Cavern of Wenchang* through the *Returning Wind* and *Merging Harmonies* with the *True Dao of the Imperial One*
can resolve ten thousand kalpas of past lives,
dissipate the clamor of lawsuits and summons across a thousand births,
and sever the entangled grievances of karmic retribution.
The names of ancestors burdened by grievances fall away.
The names of forebears across generations, erased from the ledgers of debt,
all ascend to the upper realms,
roaming and feasting in leisure beneath the *Luminous Flowers*—
this is the *Scripture of Salvation*’s *Purple Void’s Fragrant Luminous Palace*,
awaiting the cyclical turning of destiny to ascend and transform.

Roaming beneath the *Luminous Flowers*,
sweet and pungent disperse as yang,
sour and bitter surge and drain as yin.
The two qi bend and stretch beneath the *Flower Canopy* of *Jade Capital*,
as the canopy of flowers covers all heavens.
In the five viscera, the lungs are the *Flower Canopy*.
"Roaming" means leisurely feasting and wandering.

Lowering and raising to summon the Five Spirits.
The Five Spirits are the Five Elders, as noted in the final chapter of the previous scroll.
The ancients said: "Practicing the Dao is not difficult—it lies in the space between lowering and raising."
If one often gazes downward at the five viscera and exhales upward to the true qi,
the primordial spirit will manifest in form.

The body of the adept ascends to the *Jade Hall*.
The *Golden Horse* and *Jade Hall* are worldly honors,
but when your body attains the Dao and ascends to the *Jade Hall*—
the palace of the Jade Emperor, located above the head—
the five qi paying homage to the origin all converge here.
The *Scripture of Salvation* states: "Roaming the Upper Clarity, entering and exiting the *Flower Chambers*," which refers to the same.

The Five Spirits return as infants.
The Five Spirits are: *Left Non-Ultraviolet*, *Right White Prime*, *Great One*, *Controller of Destinies*, *Peach Prosperity*, and *Union of Longevity*.
"Returning as infants" means they all transform into newborns and children.
At this stage of cultivation, it is called the *Great Cavern’s Imperial Venerable* manifesting.

Together they ascend beyond the *Great Vastness*.
Rising into the formless beyond,
the third chapter of the upper scripture also says: "The numinous pass lies beneath the *Great Vastness*."
This means flying beyond the *Empty Vastness* of no traces,
to the land of *Nothing-Whatsoever*,
the expanse of the *Boundless Wilderness*—
thus confirming the earlier *Grand Perfected* without doubt.

Nurturing simplicity to pay homage to the *Perfect Illumination*.
"Nurturing simplicity" means abstaining from meat.
The ancients said: "Fine wine and delicacies are the halberds and spears that harm one’s nature;
lewd sounds and beautiful forms are the axes and saws that break one’s bones."
Those who skillfully nurture simplicity remain tranquil, desireless, and serene,
cultivating simplicity through stillness and non-action.
"Paying homage to the *Perfect Illumination*" refers to the celestial image, round and radiant with luminous brilliance.
Lord Lao said: "If a person can remain constantly pure and still, heaven and earth will all return to them."
This illustrates that if one can be clear, empty, and indifferent,
they will naturally perceive their original nature—heaven’s emptiness, roundness, and numinous clarity.
The *Perfect Illumination* is the *Mysterious Pass*, the single aperture—
not belonging to the heart, kidneys, mouth, or nose.
If one knows this single aperture,
then the winter solstice resides here,
as do the medicinal substances, fire phases, bathing, and womb liberation—all are found here.
The ancients said: "The *Mysterious Pass*, the single aperture, is the great root-source of heaven and earth,
harmonizing with the *Five Thousand Characters* and penetrating the three hundred verses"—
this is precisely it.
It is also called the method of *Silent Homage to the Emperor*.
Formerly, Zhang Tan’yao received from the Heavenly Perfected the *Dao of Internal Nourishment, Primordial Harmony, and Silent Homage to the Emperor*.
After practicing it for twelve years, he ascended lightly.
The Emperor then bestowed upon him the *Liquid of Merging Spirit and Merging Radiance*,
which he ingested, undergoing unfathomable transformations,
and was granted the title *Preserving Light, Inheriting Clarity Perfected*.

The scripture states: "Silent homage to the Emperor leads to ascension in one cycle."
Yet without encountering a enlightened teacher to point out the path of return,
the way of silent homage would also become overgrown.

The *Great Cavern* is empty, clear, and harmonious.
Eating in season, the hundred bones are ordered;
blandness allows the upright qi to settle.
People’s craving for spiciness depletes their true qi,
while craving for salt and fermented sauces shortens their lifespan.
All cravings harm the five viscera—
nothing compares to eating blandly,
for then the spirit is refreshed.
This is the wondrous practice of the *Empty Cavern*.

The *Flower* connects and guides the *Mysterious Illumination*.
Once the tongue’s *Flower* is connected,
it naturally draws the *Mysterious Illumination*’s liquid,
which is swallowed to irrigate the numinous root.
The tongue spirit connects with the *Controller of Life* and the *Upright Order of the Empty Cavern*—
this is the wondrous practice of refining the tongue’s root,
remaining unstained by the five flavors to preserve purity.

Licking and refining the *Five Sprout Pearls*.
The *Five Sprout Pearls* are the essence qi of the five phases—
metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—
the true colors of the five qi: green, red, white, black, and yellow,
the fluids of the five viscera.
When the five qi pay homage to the origin,
they transform into seminal essence,
descending from the brain to the *Crimson Palace*—
this is called the *Five Sprout Pearls*.
The *Yellow Court* states: "Storing and rinsing the five sprouts banishes hunger and thirst."
"Sprouts" signify the beginning of growth,
not yet forming a thicket.
When a person eliminates the five flavors,
they naturally obtain the rich savor of the Dao’s essence.
Nourishing and swallowing the *Great Harmony*
can generate the five sprouts.
The scripture says: "Golden grains and jade nectar—
all sought after—arrive here."

Holding the *Good Flavor* to attain longevity.
The *Traditions* say: "All people eat and drink, yet few truly know flavor."
"Good" refers to water, which is good and benefits all things.
People are without exception good;
water is without exception downward-flowing.
"Flavor" refers to the four seasons: sour in spring, bitter in summer, pungent in autumn, salty in winter,
and sweet in the four transitional periods.
If one can exhale and inhale the flavors of their original viscera in accordance with the seasons,
allowing the fluids to irrigate the spleen and stomach,
then the qi and vessels will flow smoothly.
Holding the blossoms and chewing the petals,
the savor is good, refreshing, and delightful.
The body and countenance become joyful,
the hands and feet light and nimble—
naturally attaining the Dao of longevity and enduring vision.
The method of exhaling and inhaling the five flavors—
*hu*, *he*, *xu*, *xi*, and *chui*—
each corresponds to the four seasons to dispel illness.

The above is the jade chapter of celestial seal-script, ninety characters in total,
which above governs the *Observing Clarity, Upright and Tranquil Heaven*,
and below commands the *Fourth Rampart’s King of Virtue*.
The *Mysterious Contract* states:
"The Perfected attains the *Empty Cavern*, clear and tranquil,
the tongue’s *Flower* connected without obstruction or hindrance,
the internal and external in upright order,
the *Mysterious Illumination*’s pool congealing into butter.
Swallowing the flavor of the *Five Sprout* golden liquid and jade nectar,
they can sever the roots of evil in the *Fengdu* mountain lineage,
the numinous *Seven Non-Heavens* palace,
the *Earth’s Roots*, demonic ledgers, and ghostly accounts.
Constantly offering the Dharma’s food to the *Primordial Heavenly Venerable*,
communicating all flavors,
forming the great rice-pearl,
they advance to become *Earth Immortals*.
*Earth Immortals* appear and disappear at will,
often dwelling in famous mountains, grotto heavens, and blessed lands.
If people suddenly encounter them,
they resemble the people of *Peach Blossom Spring* who fled the Qin,
or the *Hairy Woman of the Mountains*."

The *Primordial Heavenly Venerable* states: The fifteenth jade chapter of the *Great Cavern* of *Wenchang*, "The Root of the Body Caverns the True," reveals the true form where Dao and reality interpenetrate. *Gui-mao*, *jia-chen*, *shen*, and *cui*. The *Peerless True Upper Mystery*—cultivated within the body, its virtue becomes true. For the body receives touch, and the will shifts with it. When the body is cultivated, the Dao is established. Yet people’s attachments—love, pride, sloth, awe, sorrow, or pity—all stray from uprightness. The Master said: "Archery resembles the noble one, who turns inward to seek."

This chapter speaks through the body. The *Peerless* is the *Azure Numinous First Elder* of the East, residing in the human body’s left side and governing the liver. The *Upper Mystery*’s primordial essence is titled *Peerless Duke*, with the taboo name *Mystery Primordial Uncle* and the style *Uniting Talisman Master*. All beings first receive the *Five True Qi* before the *Five Spirits* are born. The *Mystery-Middle Primordial Essence Qi*.

The *Scripture* states: "In heaven’s undifferentiated chaos, the heavenly qi returns to the single body." Thus, the *Primordial Essence Lord Peerless* rides this qi. For the *Nine Primordial Qi* of the *Eastern Primordial King* are born at the *Mysterious Gate*, while yin qi arises from the *Gate of the Female*. The *Great Cavern Scripture* takes qi as its foundation: principle precedes qi, and qi precedes form. Thus, at the *Primordial Beginning*, from the *Hun Dun Supreme Non-Being* of the *Primordial Heaven Treasure Jade Sovereign*, one qi generates three qi, three generate nine qi, and from nine to the ten thousand qi, heaven and earth are established, things are opened, and affairs are accomplished. Heaven, earth, ghosts, and spirits each have their offices, ordered and unconfused.

Humans are the same: from one qi, three qi are born, and from three to the ten thousand qi, the ten thousand spirits are complete—only then is life generated. From infancy to adulthood, from old age to twilight years, returning to the root and restoring life, one remains like an infant. Cultivating this infant, one returns to the One. This is the *Great Cavern*’s method of practice, its beginning and end. Thus, the final verse concludes: "The *Talisman-Transformed Mysterious Qi King*."

The *Book of Changes* states: "Like qi seeks like." For qi of the same kind must merge. Here, the qi terms from the scripture are gathered: In the upper scroll, the *Five Phases* and *Six Qi*, the *Highest Cavern Primordial Qi Ancestor Supreme Non-Being*, the *Auspicious Qi* nurturing the *Five Clouds*, the *Five Qi* knotting the *Ten Directions*, the *Supreme Simplicity Three Flower Qi*; in the middle scroll, the *Crown-Spinning Purple Qi*, the *Dead Accumulated Qi* extracted, the *August Beginning Purple Qi*, the *Mystery-Middle Primordial Essence Qi*, the *Central Yellow Primordial Qi*, the *Azure Essence Upper Flower Qi*, the *Supreme Beginning Nine Primordial Qi*, the *Jade Sovereign’s Qi* congealing into the ten thousand qi; in the lower scroll, the *Nine August Upper True Qi*, the *Heavenly August Upper True Qi*, the *Great One Upper Primordial Qi*, the *White Qi* nurturing upper birth, the *Friend Treasure Red Qi King*, the *Floating Yellow Veiling Spirit Qi*, the *Supreme Center Six Qi* purified, the *Chen-Middle Yellow Radiance Qi*, the *Golden Watchtower Upper Radiance Qi*, the *Five Qi* governing the *Central Harmony*, the *Supreme Mystery Nine Qi*, the ten thousand qi birthing the ten thousand spirits, guarding and sealing the *Dead Qi Pass*, "from now on, dead qi is severed." The ten thousand spirits and ten thousand qi—one qi unites with *Dragon Light*, merging into the *Jade Capital’s Qi*, the *Western Primordial Nine Numinous Qi*, the *Talisman-Transformed Mysterious Qi King*. Initially called *Communing Qi*, there are thirty-four instances of the character *qi*.

The *Great Cavern Scripture* takes qi as its foundation. With qi, one can nourish the spirit; with spirit, one can nourish emptiness. If one can be empty and numinous, one accords with the principle of natural non-being.

*Entrusting Frequency* carries the *Pearl of Circulation*—*Entrusting Frequency* is the *Great One* within the Dipper, constantly turning the *Pearl of the Heart*. It is also called the *Cinnabar Terrace*, *Numinous Terrace*, *Intertwining Pear-Fire Jujube*, or *Night-Shining Pearl*. In truth, the heart spirit is named the *Spirit-Circulating Pearl*, which can be guarded day and night.

*Chaotic Transformation* opens the *Luminous Sun*—the *Nine Souls*’ spirit is named *Chaotic Transformation Return*. Crowned with the *Heaven-Penetrating Crown*, clad in a cyan robe and vermilion shoes, wielding a sword, it constantly rides the *Nine Qi Azure Light*, governing the *Primordial Yang* and opening the *Luminous Sun* to inaugurate the *Azure Yang*’s hall, descending qi as the root of life.

The *Upright One*’s *Left and Right Immortals*—the *Upright One*’s *Left Immortal* is *Emperor Guest*, and the *Right Immortal* is *Jade Harmony*. The two spirits together guard the *E* and *Yin* gates. The *Upright One* is the heart; when the heart is upright, the body is cultivated. Heaven’s sun and moon, earth’s hardness and softness, and humanity’s nature and life.

*Long Guarding the Numinous Void Chamber*—the *Void Bright Numinous Awareness Chamber* is the dwelling of the human heart spirit. To protect it long, preventing external demons from attacking, one must make this body one with the *Great Void*, encompassing the *Dharma Realm*—vast without exterior, minute without interior.

The *Portent* has the *Five Talisman Registers*—all people possess the *Five Qi* and *Five Marchmounts*’ talisman charts and registers. Those with these registers attain the immortal Dao. The *Jade Sovereign Scripture* states: "If one can wear the *Five Directions’ True Writ* and *Five Marchmounts’ Talisman Charts* to enter the mountains and cultivate the Dao, the hundred spirits will be awed and submit."

*Uniting with Immortals to attain the True One*—*True* is the *Sincerity* of the *Doctrine of the Mean*. What practices it is the *One*. The *True One* is the infant, meaning to focus on the One without distraction, sincere and without falsehood. *True* is undivided; *One* is undual. This is the *Undual Dharma Gate of the True One*.

*The Hun souls are born in the Supreme Non-Being*—the *Three Hun* are named *Womb Light*, *Luminous Spirit*, and *Hidden Essence*. Each hun has two attendants, totaling the *Nine Hun*. The *Nine Hun* are born within the *Supreme Non-Being*. The Dao of immortals proceeds from non-being to being, then from being returns to non-being—beginning and end complete.

*The Po souls lie hidden in the Five Paths’ secrecy*—the *Seven Po* are named *Corpse Dog*, *Crouching Arrow*, *Sparrow Yin*, *Swallowing Thief*, *Flying Poison*, *Removing Filth*, and *Stinking Lung*. Together, they are seven. One must nourish the yang hun and subdue the yin po. When the hun are born, the po should be subdued. The five viscera’s evil qi and the roads’ blockages are sealed, never to emerge again.

*Generation after generation, karmic knots are untied*—the *Wenchang Great Cavern*’s *Returning Wind Merging* practice of the *Imperial One True Dao* can untie the myriad kalpas and thousand lives of ancestral grievances, lawsuits, and summons, as well as the entangled karmic debts of parents and clan. All are dissolved and universally liberated.

The Seven Ancestors’ blockages are severed.

Xue Youqi was a native of Baoding in Pu Prefecture. Having passed the imperial examinations in the Kaiyuan era, he was appointed, in his youth, as a magistrate in Ling Commandery. Before his term was complete, stirred by a longing for forests and springs, he cast off his sleeves and entered Mount Shoucheng. He visited the abodes of the Heavenly Masters at Mount Emei and Mount Heming, then journeyed to Mount Nanyue, where he recited the *Great Cavern Scripture*. His disciples numbered in the hundreds, gathering daily at his side as he expounded on the subtle mysteries of the Dao. Emperor Minghuang praised his insights, and he annotated the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure*, devoting himself to refining and delivering the lonely souls of his parents and ancestors. Later, he attained the Dao and ascended in transformation, while hundreds of his disciples achieved liberation through *shi jie*. Was this not because he first delivered his Seven Ancestors before delivering himself?

*The Divine Wind stirs the Womb-Tree*—
The *Scripture of Deliverance* states: *"The Divine Wind is still and silent."* The Divine Wind emerges from the bellows of Heaven and Earth, stirring and animating all life. The Womb-Tree is the root of the womb’s blood and filth. The Divine Wind, as the body’s divine *qi*, can pluck the dead and deliver the living.

*Its roots and branches are utterly severed*—
The root, stem, branches, and leaves of the womb are entirely withered and gone without remnant. Through the cultivation of wondrous practices to this point, relying on the *Returning Wind Merging* Dao, one sweeps away the evil roots and earthly bonds, uprooting the womb’s knots and fetal entanglements at once.

*My kith and kin*—
*The multitude of calamitous ghosts within the womb*—
Within the womb, ghostly spirits abound. The yang spirit desires human life to have something to depend upon, while yin ghosts desire human death to have something to feast upon. Allying with them, the *Lesser Lad of the Great Subtlety* constantly wields banners to summon their souls, descending spirits to spread *qi* and foster their growth into human form. For those not yet born, it is the multitude of ghosts that brings harm. In refining the Golden Elixir, one must also cherish the Sacred Embryo. Formerly, Tang Ruo of Lu Commandery, during the *Pre-Celestial* era, served as a minister and successively governed demanding commanderies. In the Kaiyuan era, he was appointed governor of Runzhou, where his governance was benevolent. His younger brother was a Daoist of Mount Heng, and together they received the essentials of the *Embryonic Valley Spirit*. Often summoned into the palace, Tang Ruo later sought to return to the mountains and was permitted to do so. Upon reaching the Yangzi River, he ascended amidst a five-colored mist and became an immortal. His brother achieved *shi jie*. Those who skillfully nurture the Embryonic Origin are not harmed by ghosts and ascend as divine immortals. The blessings of this scripture for life and death are beyond measure.

*The Five Talismans seal the earth’s knots*—
The Five Talismans are those received by the Five Elders. Heaven possesses Five Talismans to sustain generation and transformation; Earth possesses Five Talismans to maintain tranquility and harmony; humans possess Five Talismans to ensure bodily health and peace. Thus, they obstruct and sever the earth’s stagnant knots.

*Forever as divine perfected immortals*—
Immortals are perfected immortals, divine immortals. There are five kinds of immortals: celestial immortals, terrestrial immortals, aquatic immortals, ghostly immortals, and divine immortals. This chapter focuses on cultivating the root of the body, nurturing the other through the self, and refining the true through the illusory.

*Responding and transforming, they continue for myriad eons*—
Having attained the immortal Dao, one should respond and transform within the world, guiding and delivering all beings. Even the Most Venerable and Noble Lord Lao descended eighty-two times to be born, for he responded to those awaiting deliverance. His thousand transformations and myriad changes far exceed mere continuation for ten thousand eons.

*The Cavern-True purifies the body*—
The root of all under Heaven lies in the body of the One. The five limbs and hundred bones are governed by the master of a single thought. If one loses the power of preservation, calamity and chaos will surely arise. To cultivate the body, first rectify the heart. Once a single thought is rectified, the *ying* and *wei* naturally harmonize. As it is said: *"With a unified will, *qi* moves."* The *Elixir Scripture* states: *"Like a magnet drawing iron, it penetrates barriers unseen. In a single thought, the myriad *qi* and spirits gather as one."* This body is formed of earth, water, fire, and wind. Through cultivation here, a body arises beyond the body. As the ancients said: *"Two [forms] appear identical, yet only when merit is complete does one emerge from the dust."*

*The Dao flows through the natural substance*—
The *Book of Changes* states: *"If it is not the right person, the Dao does not act in vain."* The Dao within the body cannot be separated even for a moment. The Dao flows through the natural substance, which is not the body formed of impure earth, water, fire, and wind. The Buddhist scriptures say: *"Only the Dharma-body abides eternally, unperishing,"* and *"the indestructible Vajra-body."* These are the natural substances, called the wondrous body—unseen when approached, unseen when followed. For it is the profound stillness of true emptiness, pervading Heaven and Earth yet without end, encompassing the cosmos yet without beginning. This is our natural substance.

*The true responds and manifests forms*—
The true and constant nature, still yet responsive, is called the true yang. It manifests forms through transformation, as in the thirty-two marks and eighty excellences of Lord Lao, his thousand transformations and myriad changes, dispersing to answer the prayers of the world, granting all that is sought.

*Abiding unmoved in the Yellow Chamber*—
The true body remains fixed and unchanging; the manifested bodies respond merely to the hearts of people, like the moon reflected in water—one moon in a thousand rivers. As the Buddha said: *"Do not grasp at forms; thusness is unmoving."* The Yellow Chamber is the Yellow Court, the Central Palace.

*The responding and transforming are boundless*—
The responding and transforming bodies are present everywhere, like the moon seen in every river and stream. Even in a thousand vessels of water, the moon is present in each, its size varying only with the vessel’s capacity. So too do the manifestations of the true response vary with the depth of people’s roots and capacities.

Wang Changyu of Shuzhou was a hereditary scribe. Later, in Jiang’an, he encountered a destitute, drunken immortal who called himself the *True Man of the Mysterious and Yellow*. He transmitted to Wang the *Great Elixir of the Red Dragon*. On the Double Ninth Festival of the thirteenth year of the *Great Middle* era of the Great Tang, Wang ascended a parasol tree and departed as an immortal. He was granted the title *Perfected of Preserving Harmony* and appointed Left Minister of the Three Heavens. Later, during the *Zhenghe* era, he transformed into an *Iron Jar Daoist*, selling medicines in the markets of Shuzhou. To his grandson, Wang Daoyuan, he said: *"I am your ancestor."*

The Emperor commanded me to collate the thirty-nine chapters of the *Canon of the Great Cavern*. Now I transmit them to you, along with the three scrolls of the *Secret Register of the Upper Yang’s Inner Prohibitions for Returning Wind, Merging Scenery, Unifying Perfection, and Flying as an Immortal*. Through these, you may understand that once one ascends as an immortal, one must also transform and descend to broadly deliver beings across heaven and earth. Yet the true body remains ever in its celestial position—just as the Jade Emperor divides his form and transforms, never absent from the Golden Tower. So too do the ten thousand qi and ten thousand spirits within the human body: when gathered, they are one; when scattered, they reach the ten directions.

Bone and flesh are as solid as metal and jade. Bone and flesh, like metal and jade, are enduring. For the Dao of *Great Cavern of Wenchang* and *Returning Wind Merging Perfection*, when cultivation reaches its utmost, bone and flesh ascend together. This is because the true fire of the south warms and refines the white tiger’s golden essence to complete the supreme elixir of the Golden Pill—like the hardness of metal and the smoothness of jade. As the transmission says: *"Virtue moistens the body; the heart broadens, and the form flourishes."* In the elixir, the body is lead, and the heart is mercury. When these two substances unite in marriage, they may become as firm as metal and jade. The Buddhists regard this as the *śarīra*, which fire cannot destroy and iron cannot shatter—formed from the undispersed essence and qi of the human body.

The Dao of utmost clarity and true illumination: *"Sincerity in the body has its Dao. Without understanding goodness, one cannot be sincere in the body."* The utmost Dao is the Dao of utmost goodness. Through stillness and the true unity, this perfectly good and beautiful Dao is made luminous. One who can firmly uphold it may become an upper immortal.

Even in extreme old age, this resolve does not change. Though this is spoken for worldly people, it is not the Dao of the upper immortals. The upper immortals attain long life and enduring vision, deathless and unforgetting. For the old endure through kalpas unbroken, their bodies spanning ancient and present time—existing before heaven and earth without beginning, persisting after heaven and earth without end. They stand alone and unchanging, the so-called original substance. The Buddhists speak only of the *dharmakāya* as eternally abiding and indestructible. Most people mistakenly take the four great elements’ temporary union as true reality. Once spirit and qi disperse, it is no better than stinking rot, cast aside—worse than beasts and livestock.

The above jade script in celestial seal comprises one hundred thirty characters. Above, it governs the *Mysterious Brightness and Reverent Celebration Heaven*; below, it commands the *Fourth Rampart and Lord of Virtue*.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: *"The perfected one attains the true, tranquil, and responsive form of the Cavern-Truth, the Dao unobstructed. They eternally abide, transforming into boundless bodies, present without limit. The dharmakāya eternally dwells in the Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital, naturally responding and transforming. In all ten directions, their own body appears, and other bodies attain freedom. They can sever the roots of evil in the Fengdu Mountain’s Daring Bureau, the Linked Winding Heaven Palace, and the demonic registers of the earth’s roots. Constantly, they offer celestial robes and earthly garments to the Primordial Heavenly King, covering above and below, ascending to become divine immortals."*

The divine immortals come and go from grotto-heavens, their transformations ceaseless. Suddenly dwelling among humans, they change their heads and faces—unrecognized by others. These are the *four fruits of arhats* and the *five penetrations of divine immortals*.

The Primordial Heavenly King said: *"The sixteenth jade scripture of the* Great Cavern of Wenchang*: the root of intention penetrates clarity; the great meaning primordially unobstructed."*

*Yisi, Bingwu, Ascending, Distress.*

The nine primordial qi of the Great Beginning: The intention pertains to the central earth, with the spleen and stomach as its dwelling. This is the beginning of the qi of the Great Beginning. The nine primals are the nine yangs, likened to the qi one first receives from father and mother. The character *su* (primordial) appears thirteen times. The upper scroll says: *"Three primordials give birth to the nine muds,"* referring to the Three Primordial Lords—whose taboo names are Han, Zhang, and Boshi—initiating the three primordials. The *qi of the Three Primordial Florals*, the *Three Primordials brushing the distant scene*—these phrases share the same meaning. The middle scroll’s *"riding the primordial into the four luminaries"* differs in principle. *Suqi* initiates Xiao Ren as the name of the White Primordial Lord, the *primordial qi of the Mysterious Center*—referring to *Wu Ying*. The central yellow primordial qi: the Yellow Elder Lord’s nine primordial qi of the Great Beginning, the first sprouting of the nine yang qi. The lower scroll’s *"Great Primordial Brahman Conduct Initiation"* refers to the five great qi before form and substance separate. *"Left-hand escorting the Primordial Lord of the Left Wu Ying"* shares the same meaning as the middle scroll’s *"primordial qi of the Mysterious Center."* *"Great Primordial Cavern-Spirit Numinous"* shares meaning with *"Three Primordial Floral Qi."* *"Three Elders’ Primordial Han Zhang"* shares meaning with *"Three Primordials giving birth to the mud pill."* *Su* means emptiness and purity—all are the true qi of the three fields. The nine primordials differ from the three primordials. The purple primordial, white primordial, and yellow primordial are the qi of the Three Ren Lords, corresponding to the human liver, lungs, and spleen—the coagulation of the green, yellow, and white three qi.

The qi emerges within the radiant scene. These nine primordials emerge from the realm of luminous splendor, likening the qi first transmitted from the parents’ essence and blood. *Jing* (scene) means color and image—the first formation of the embryo, when spirit and essence complete the body, resplendent and flashing.

The *Dharma Enclosure* dances the immortal banner. *Fayuan* is also called *Fatan* (an error), referring to the three enclosures of *Ziwei*, *Taiwei*, and *Tianshi*. It is also called the *enclosure wall* or *city*—the jade city behind the brain. For cultivators, it is the path of silent audience, also the name of the Great One within the Dipper. *Dancing the immortal banner* means using banners and pennants to summon the hun and ling spirits. This chapter focuses on cultivating the root of intention, thus generating wisdom—sincerity of intention precedes the extension of knowledge. The lower scroll’s *"Dharma Enclosure rises in Crimson Empyrean"* shares this meaning. The Great One within the Dipper is the spirit that summons the true and induces the numinous. When one attains it, true spirits descend and divine qi spreads.

Swiftly circling the five venerable elders. *Juanxun* means swiftness—urging the five elders to each spread their true qi and receive the hun and po. The five elders are: *Jade Clarity’s Vast Ultimate Primordial Elder*, *Empty Sovereign’s Numinous Light Origin Elder*, *Mysterious Floral Treasure Heaven True Elder*, *Dewy Vast Numinous Ancestral Elder*, and *Verdant Luxuriant Vast Capital Immortal Elder*—the distinguished guests of the prior five elders, the ancestral qi of the five phases within the Great Ultimate.

When one receives the five qi, only then can form be completed; when the elixir obtains these five qi, only then can the Great Return of Golden Liquor be achieved. As the scripture states: "Heaven and earth receive them to divide and judge; sun and moon receive them to circulate and move."

The Lady Initiate-Pearl—*Hui Feng Hun He Shang Zhen Sheng Mu Zhong Hou Yuan Jun Wang Fu Ren Ming Qi Zhu*—is also called the Lady of the Mud-Pill Palace. The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: "The Lady of the Mud-Pill Palace stands at the center," for she is the spirit of the Feminine One. Some may doubt how the heavens could bear a lady’s name, yet they do not realize that heaven and the human realm are in truth one. In former times, the daughter of Wei Shu, Left Attendant of the Masters of Writing under Emperor Wu of Jin, was named Hua Cun, styled Xian’an. From childhood, she delighted in reading the *Zhuangzi*, *Laozi*, the *Three Commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals*, the *Five Classics*, and the *Hundred Masters*. At twenty-four, her parents compelled her to marry, and she was wed to Liu Yi, styled Youyan, a subordinate of the Grand Protector. Though she conducted herself with propriety, the times left her no choice, and she became Liu’s wife. Once her children had grown and Liu’s lineage was secured, she sought to live apart. At the time, Yi served as Magistrate of Xiuwu, and the Lady thereupon cultivated the Way of the Great Cavern’s Imperial One. One night, amidst celestial music, she beheld banners descending from the sky to her chamber, where four perfected ones took their seats: the True Person An Duming of the Great Ultimate, the Great Divinity Fangzhu of the Eastern Flower, the Divine Lord Qingxu of Fusang’s Yang Valley, and Wang Zideng, the Heavenly King of Lesser Existence. The Lady bowed and sought their instruction. After receiving the Dao, she feigned illness and achieved liberation through the corpse, some witnessing the Primordial Sovereign of the Great One arrive in a whirlwind carriage to welcome her. This occurred in the fourth year of Xianhe under the Eastern Jin. She was enfeoffed as the Primordial Lady of Purple Emptiness, overseeing the Southern Office of Life, and later elevated to Lady of the Southern Marchmount, her rank equal to that of an Immortal Duke. She is the ancestral master of the Great Cavern of Supreme Clarity.

Thus we know that the heavens also bear the title of "Lady," a rank equivalent to the third grade, held by female immortals.

**Holding the register, she retreats to the Purple Chamber.**
The Lady takes the register into the Purple Chamber, located behind the brain—also called the Purple Portal—where she presents it to the Jade Emperor, declaring that she has summoned the hun and po and thus achieved transformation. The scriptures often mention the Purple Chamber, or sometimes the Yellow Chamber, referring to the Central Yellow Court.

**The Primordial Father revolves leftward in luminous clarity.**
The Primordial Father of the Upper Mystery is the spirit of intent, governing the Four Symbols. As noted in the fourth chapter of the upper scroll, the scriptures on practice state that the mind should move like a monkey, never resting for even a moment. If one wishes to subdue it, one must recite the Great Vehicle. The ancients said: "Gathering the mind in one place is the bodhimanda of the Way; scattering intent for even an instant casts one into the realm of sentient beings." Intent is the chief of the four spirits among the five viscera, the central ground of upper, lower, and middle equilibrium. If one can day and night observe, examine, and rouse it, preventing its dull accumulation, maintaining constant clarity, then after a hundred days, one will naturally attain numinous communion.

**Merging with the Lad of the Grand Tenuity.**
When the spirit of intent merges water and fire, the Lad of the Grand Tenuity spreads qi and descends the divine to generate our body—this is the spirit that initiates the coagulation of the embryo. In the elixir, when lead first arises, one must gather it with proper method to refine the Golden Liquor Returning Elixir.

**Penetrating wisdom of the Cavernous Clarity.**
The *Scripture of Salvation* speaks of "cavernous wisdom penetrating clarity," while the *Scripture of Spirit Generation* says: "reveling in cavernous wisdom." This refers to the seven awakenings of our wisdom, thoroughly luminous and clear. As it is said: "When things are fathomed, knowledge is attained; with knowledge comes wisdom and prajñā."

**The great intent shines, primordial and unobstructed.**
One version omits "wisdom shines," while another asks: "How could one obtain?" Intent is will, governed by the spleen and issued by the heart. Thus, when the heart is rectified, intent becomes sincere—this is what is meant by "sincere and true intent," without self-deception. The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states: "If one wishes to know the Buddha’s realm, one must purify one’s intent like empty space." *Mencius* says: "Will is the master of qi." In the Dao of the elixir, it serves as the Yellow Dame, for it can mediate and unite the qi of the five viscera, gathering them into one. Between metal and wood, without a mediator, nothing can be accomplished. The maiden in blue and the youth in white silk must have their monkey and horse subdued, whereupon the tortoise and serpent will unite.

When the great intent is once attained, it becomes thoroughly unobstructed, luminous and pure, traversing past and future kalpas without hindrance, knowing and seeing all. In the Dao, this is the Ten Penetrations; in Buddhism, the Six Penetrations; among the spirits and ghosts of the middle realm, the Five Penetrations—all inseparable from the Middle Way. In all matters, attaining the mean enables one to be universally perceptive.

**The roots and dusts are all extinguished.**
The six roots are the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and intent; the six dusts are form, sound, scent, flavor, touch, and dharmas. All illusory delusions instantly dissipate, for with sincere intent, there is no principle of false movement. No person is perfect, yet if even one root awakens, through mutual cultivation and realization, one can extinguish the six cavernous demon-kings and their calamitous thieves, thereby attaining purity of the six roots, harmony of the six palaces, and freedom from the constraints of the six qi. Thus, one with all six desires is a common mortal; one without any is a true immortal. The *Scripture of Salvation* speaks of the coarse dusts first purified, the fine dusts not yet purified—hence one cannot escape the three realms.

**Existence and nonexistence both become empty space.**
The dual views of existence and nonexistence both return to emptiness and quiescence. This is to practice the Way of the Mean, like hating foul odors or loving beautiful forms—this is called self-contentment. The ancient worthies said: "When empty space is pulverized, the complete truth is revealed."

**Wondrous practice fulfills the Ten Perfections.**
When the three thousand wondrous practices of the Great Cavern are perfected, the Way of the Ten Perfections is fulfilled. Unceasing, it endures; enduring, it corrects, ultimately accomplishing both self and others—all emerging from this Way. The *Great Cavern Scripture* regards the cultivation of wondrous practice as supreme. Its concluding verses state: "The Six Pāramitās and Ten Penetrations, with myriad practices perfected." But what are the Six Pāramitās?

The six chapters of the lower scroll provide explanations, and due to their greater length compared to the middle scroll, annotations are appended here. The ninth chapter of the upper scroll, *Mysterious Accord*, states: "Those who have ascended through the six stages have first cultivated the Ten Faiths of the initial mind, then aroused the Ten Goodnesses, next blossomed the Ten Flowers, then perfected the Ten Powers, gradually verified the Ten Immortals, and ultimately attained the Ten Perfections.

1. The Ten Faiths of the initial mind: Awakening the mind of faith, aligning with the mechanism of shared faith, thoughts unwavering in faith, acting through faith, the Five Faiths residing within, inscribing faith in metal and stone, perfecting great faith, good faith enduring to the end, steadfast faith advancing forward—only then is it called true faith.

2. Next, arousing the Ten Goodnesses: The second chapter of the upper scroll states, 'The Ten Goodnesses arise within the mysterious.' Hearing goodness, the Mysterious ascends to the forehead, the Six Dīng radiate luminous light; seeing goodness, the Cinnabar Origin forms square pupils, the Eight Historians illuminate clarity; speaking goodness, life is communicated and the mouth rinsed, the Five Scripts and Kingly Flowers bloom; treading goodness, strength is harnessed and earthly barriers traverse life; contemplating goodness and practicing goodness, utmost goodness knows no transgression; abiding in goodness and preserving peace, settled goodness establishes the foundation. Perfecting the Ten Goodnesses requires but the ten characters of 'goodness.'

3. Blossoming the Ten Flowers: Derived from the seventh chapter of the lower scroll, *The Ten Flowers Observation Gate of Mysterious Accord*. According to the scripture of the upper scroll: 'The Ten Flowers are the wondrous practices of immortals; the Ten Penetrations arise therefrom.' These are the numbers of the *River Chart*. The Five Phases complete generation, the Eight Trigrams array themselves—all heaven, earth, beings, and things are examined thereby to come into being. Once born, they again know and cultivate, esteeming the shedding of the Five Phases' husk and departing from the Eight Trigrams' mechanism, thereby verifying and ascending to wondrous practice, as noted below the title.

4. Next, perfecting the Ten Powers: The eighth chapter of the lower scroll, *Mysterious Accord*, and the sixth scripture of the upper scroll state: 'The Ten Powers first perfect the mechanism.' The eighth scripture of the lower scroll states: 'The Ten Powers proclaim the true script.' Employing power to harmonize with the body, advancing power on level ground, perfecting power in vastness, wisdom-power inwardly purifying, kindness-power emitting light, luminous power blooming in fullness, numinous power universally responding, mysterious power in the Great Square, great power in spontaneity, universal power aiding and embracing.

5. Gradually verifying the Ten Immortals: From the ninth chapter of the lower scroll, *Mysterious Accord*—Womb Immortal, Womb-Enveloped Immortal, Ethereal-Soul Immortal, Corporeal-Soul Immortal, Numinous Immortal, Original Immortal, Flower Immortal, Mountain Immortal, Visceral Immortal, Original-Life Spirit Immortal.

6. Ultimately attaining the Ten Perfections: From the tenth chapter of the lower alley, *Mysterious Accord*. The ninth chapter of the upper scroll states: 'The Ten Perfections ascend to the Purple Chamber.' The tenth chapter of the middle scroll states: 'Wondrous practice fulfills the Ten Perfections.' The tenth chapter of the lower scroll states: 'Wondrous practice ascends to the Ten Perfections.' The eleventh chapter of the lower alley states: 'The Ten Perfections fulfill wondrous practice.' Essence-perfection in the Mysterious Pearl, qi-perfection in Mysterious Power, spirit-perfection in Mysterious Penetration, nature-perfection in Mysterious Unity, origin-perfection in Mysterious Wonder, life-perfection in Mysterious Radiance, form-perfection in Mysterious Wholeness, virtue-perfection in Mysterious Cavern, Dao-perfection in Mysterious Response, command-perfection in the Great Mystery—these six are called the Six Pāramitās and Ten Penetrations. Having ascended through the six stages, wondrous practice is fully accomplished.

This is called the Great Mind’s Spiritual Penetration. The spirit within the mind, when moved, achieves penetration; penetration enables transformation, transformation enables endurance. When the spirit endures, the creations of heaven and earth become manifest before one. All worldly affairs arise from the mind. When the mind’s spirit is penetrated, it does not turn with external things. Sincerity of intent precedes rectitude of mind, leading to universal peace, national stability, and the people’s prosperity. How great is this name! There has never been one who, without cultivating the self, gained early renown throughout the world. The *Book of Songs* says: 'There, they bear no ill; here, they are not detested. Day and night, they strive to perpetuate their glorious reputation as immortals.'

Tradition records: In former times, Liu Yuanqing of Wuchang studied under Master Wang Zongdao, transmitting the registers of the Three Caverns. He constantly practiced the Dao of Returning Wind and Uniting Harmonies, abstained from grains to refine qi, yet drank over a *dou* of wine. At the beginning of the Baoli era, Emperor Jingzong sought Daoist adepts, and the military supervisor Lü Lingcong summoned him. Yuanqing said: 'I have a mountain wife and a concubine west of the pond, for whom beef is life. If I am taken as a master of arts, I fear the general may incur the charge of deceiving the throne.' Thereupon, he requested a pig’s shoulder, sliced it himself, and ate it with garlic sauce. Lü, suspicious, dismissed him. Unable to refuse, he journeyed to the capital and was summoned to the Hall of Administrative Governance, where he was questioned on matters of immortality. His answers were deemed unsatisfactory, and he was sent away. In the third year of Huichang, he was summoned again and responded to the emperor’s satisfaction. Emperor Jingzong bestowed upon him the registers of the Dao, appointing him Grand Master for Closing Court with Silver and Cyan, Chancellor of the Academy of Mysteries, and granted him the title Master of Vast Accomplishment. In the fifth year of Dazhong, in the tenth month, clouds, cranes, and celestial music filled the skies above Luofu. He then underwent liberation by means of the corpse, leaving behind only his staff and sandals. Is this not verification of the Great Mind’s Spiritual Penetration? If one is unwilling to act, those who do act achieve the same.

The Dao is complete, ascending to the Jade Clarity. Wisdom, benevolence, and courage—these three are the universal virtues of the world. Knowing these three, one knows how to cultivate the self. Those born with knowledge, those who practice with ease, and those who achieve success—all are one. The *Cavern Scripture* here may be said to have entered the realm of sages and worthies. Virtue and the Dao are perfectly fulfilled and complete, ascending to the sacred realm of the Upper Jade Clarity. Cultivating to this point, one may release the yang spirit from the Mud Pill Palace.

Some say: 'If the dwelling is ruined...' Confucius said: 'In the morning, hear the Dao; in the evening, die content.' The Upper Realm of Jade Clarity is the Gate of Myriad Wonders within the Mud Pill Palace of humans. Rebirth and union are all entered and exited thereby; human death also departs through it.

The rank of Sage Immortal Duke. The immortal ranks and sacred positions should be called Immortal Duke. Previously, there were the Five Elderly Ones, so it should not redundantly be called 'Duke.' The tenth chapter of the middle scroll takes the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and intent, along with fluids, hands, feet, essence, blood, nature, and life as primary. Thereby, the Four Great Elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—provisionally unite to form this illusory body. One should rely on this illusory body to cultivate and verify the true vehicle, lest the six senses be lured by private human desires, thereby falling into the demonic palaces of the Six Caverns. The body soars beyond the Six Directions, attaining the fruit of Jade Clarity Immortal Duke."

The Buddha explained: "When the Tathāgata speaks of all marks, their fullness is not true fullness—this is called the fullness of all marks. When the Tathāgata speaks of a self, there is no true self, yet ordinary beings take it to be real. Generally, one should not cling to the illusory as the actual, thereby transcending the mundane form and attaining verification of Suchness."

In former times, Master Nie of the Dao, styled Zongwei, was naturally perceptive from birth and served his parents with filial piety. He received the *Great Cavern Scripture* and deeply penetrated its essentials. He encountered the two Perfected Ones, Peng and Cai, and later met the Perfected One Xie Xiutong, who said to him: "Peng and Cai and I have concealed ourselves here for two hundred years. Recently, the Lord of Eastern Florescence commanded us to oversee the Earth Immortals of Jade Bamboo Mountain and the Pavilion of Pure Emptiness. You and I share a predestined affinity with the Dao, so I have come to inform you. You should cultivate diligently, for you are destined for the rank of Immortal Duke." Suddenly, they vanished. Master Nie soon after ascended as a feathered transcendent—was this not verification of the Immortal Duke?

In the Great Yuan dynasty, Gui of Pengzhou Guard in Peng Prefecture practiced the Dao of harmonious union. He constantly recited the *Great Cavern* and *Numinous Treasure* scriptures, and the *Book of Changes* never left his hands. He wandered Peng Mountain and dwelled on Jade Bamboo Mountain, sometimes sitting on a boulder for days. Once, a tiger circled near him, yet he paid it no mind, and the tiger remained at ease.

Another day, as if in a dream, he entered a vast cavern extending several *li* deep. In a luminous space, he saw palaces and was told by someone: "This is no place for you. Depart swiftly." He then ascended the mountain, where pines and bamboos swayed gracefully, deer cried and cranes called. Another voice said: "The time has not yet come. Return for now, and you will be summoned again later." Thereafter, his conduct was extraordinary. On the twenty-eighth day of the fifth month in the *jiawu* year of the Zhiyuan era, at dusk, he heard a voice call: "The Emperor commands your presence. Come swiftly!" He rose abruptly and set out, vanishing midway—was this not his ascent to Jade Clarity and verification as Immortal Duke?

The above jade script of celestial seal, eighty characters in all, governs above the Supreme Jade Heaven of Great Brilliance and rules below the Fourth Rampart, Lord Wang of Virtue.

The *Mysterious Accord* states: "The Perfected One, with profound wisdom of Cavern Clarity, fully comprehends the primordial unity. Root and dust are severed, worldly dharmas extinguished, and the dual burdens of existence and non-existence are utterly stilled. Through the wondrous practice of preserving the True, one attains the great mind and divine penetrations, capable of severing the demonic registers of Fengdu Mountain’s Mingchen Naifan, the evil roots of the Celestial Palace of Wucheng, and the ghostly ledgers of the Earth’s roots. Constantly offering dharma wealth to the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning and bestowing it upon all, one universally fulfills all needs, becoming a Great Wealth King and perfectly advancing to the rank of Flying Immortal in the ten directions.

The Flying Immortal soars through the void, rides clouds and cranes, dwells upon the pillars of flowery banners, rises at dawn in Fusang, and rests at dusk in Xianchi—such as Ding Lingwei and Xu Zizhen.

*Jade Clarity, Boundless, and Supreme Perfected Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture of the Dao*, Scroll Six
● "Head" (*shou*)—likely a misprint for "Azure" (*qing*).
● [Square]—this character is illegible in the original text.

*Jade Clarity, Boundless, and Supreme Perfected Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture of the Dao*, Scroll Seven
Annotated by Zhongyangzi Wei Qi of Penglai Mountain in Eastern Shu.

The Primordial Heavenly King of the Origin spoke: "The seventeenth jade chapter of the *Great Cavern Scripture of Wenchang* states: 'The hands and feet are pervaded by numinous power; the strength of hands and feet is universally penetrating.'

*Dingwei*, *Wu Shen*, *Jing*, and *Ge*.

Within the imperial purple qi of the Primordial Beginning—or as some say, 'humans possess six roots; how then do they also have hands, feet, and the like?'—they know not that when emotions and desires arise, all become root-dust, which is what the Buddhists call the five aggregates, six sense-bases, and twelve sense-fields. The strength of hands and feet lies in the cultivation of qi. When spirit and qi are fully harmonized, one delights in the five destinies, unaware of the hands dancing and the feet leaping.

The Primordial Purple Void Lady of the Imperial Beginning resides within the purple qi—also called the Purple Portal—behind the gate of Jade Capital Mountain. Some mistake 'purple qi' for 'purple origin' due to their similar graphs, leading to transmission errors. The Twelve Bodhisattvas of the human realm say: 'The dung-carrier bears his load with strength.' The strength of the hands denotes courage, vigor, and unyielding progress, unwavering in the face of great adversity. This is what the tradition calls 'choosing the good and firmly holding to it,' and what the Two Teachings call 'steadfast adherence and resolute guardianship'—not the mere act of grasping with the hands. The strength of the feet lies in truly treading and practicing the path.

Radiant light illumines the layered heavens.

Its brilliance shines resplendent above the ninefold heavens. When one’s hands grasp and feet walk, all accords with the correct principle. Thus, purple qi arises in the brain, illuminating it. The character *xiao* (霄) has nine forms: the celestial spirits roam the Golden Heaven; harmonious tones resound beyond the Nine Heavens; the Perfected shines upon the Nine Heavens; the Jade Emperor rides the Vermilion Heaven; the Dharma Enclosure flourishes in the Vermilion Heaven; riding the light, one ascends the Supreme Heaven; the Three Flowers ascend the Heavenly Court; radiant light illumines the layered heavens; and the returning heavens hover over the boundless desert. Though there are nine heavens, their meanings differ. They are not merely heavens but also bear names such as crowns, pendants, chariots, and canopies, each named according to what one perceives.

The Three Heavens illumine the Nine Luminaries.

The Three Qi generate the Nine Qi, forming the Three Treasures and Nine Heavens—all realms of the pure and luminous Dao of the Great Yang. The radiance of the luminaries shines resplendently in the everlasting, undarkened heavens. The head, hands, and feet are named the Three Passes, guarding the nine orifices. One must strive for clarity, brightness, and radiance.

Separation and union give rise to the myriad beings.

Is not Qian and Kun the gate of the *Changes*? Separation and union are opening and closing. The *Book of Changes* states: 'Opening the gate is Qian; closing the gate is Kun.' When Qian and Kun transform and interpenetrate, there arises the principle of ceaseless generation. The Dao’s qi separates and then reunites.

Wearing a vermilion kerchief and a robe of green aurora,

This describes the Primordial Purple Void Lady of the Imperial Beginning: her head wrapped in a crimson kerchief, her body clad in a robe of green aurora. In the third scroll above, it is written: 'The green aurora illumines the golden ramparts'—some say 'Six Auroras,' an error arising from phonetic similarity.

Above, she turns the numinous power of the Cold Youth.

The Cold Youth is the Azure Lad, the domain of the Eastern Green Dragon. The Primordial Purple Void Lady of the Imperial Beginning, fearing stagnation and complacency that would prevent the nurturing of the myriad beings, returns his numinous power to them, allowing each to find its proper place.

Uprooting the five poisons of suffering,

Uprooting the bitterness and toxins of the three evil destinies and five sufferings. The previous passage spoke of 'uprooting the realm of five sufferings'; here it is called 'poisons,' for within the realm of five sufferings, there are yet the five poisons: the qi of the fire cart, freezing ice, severe cold, scorching heat, and acrid bitterness.

Transcending form to surpass the Beginning Azure.

The eight Brahma heavens and nine heavens: the Eastern Beginning Azure Heaven and the Great Azure Heaven. This speaks of one transcending form and spirit, surpassing the Beginning Azure Heaven to reach the Desire Realm, Form Realm, and Formless Realm, then the Four Brahma Heavens of the Seed People, the Nine Heavens of Divine Aurora, and the Supreme Three Heavens. When one meticulously enumerates each heaven, the distances span tens of thousands of miles. Truly, one cannot ascend by steps. Yet the adept, through penetrating understanding, may traverse without crossing barriers or treading shores. In the span of a single thought, one may directly reach beyond the summit.

White Simplicity initiates the towering Xiao,

White Simplicity, the Right Primordial Lady named Initiator of Light, and Xiao Ren, the White Primordial Honored Deity, open the towering Xiao Terrace. Previously, it was called 'Purple Simplicity and Non-Ultimate'—here named the Three Simplicities and Three Peaks, the names of three deities. Some say 'Yellow Simplicity,' which is grossly mistaken.

The Golden Gate is guarded by vermilion soldiers.

The Western Seven Treasures Golden Gate is heavily fortified, its defenses manned by vermilion soldiers. This metaphorically describes the true fire refining true gold, whereby the elixir path is accomplished. Here, it speaks of the White Simplicity Right Primordial Lady stationed above the Golden Gate, its defenses stern and unyielding.

The seven ancestors accumulate corpse-knots,

In the Western Seven Qi Heaven, corpse-knots congeal as yin coagulates. Thus, the spirits of the seven ancestors intertwine, their corporeal roots and impure qi accumulating, unable to disperse until the cyclical movement of the Dao’s qi flows through them.

One transformation topples a hundred evils.

With true fire, one transforms the myriad layers of gold ore, dissolving yin with yang. Through the Dao’s qi, the corpse-knots of the seven ancestors are untied, causing a hundred evils to dissipate at once. Ancestral ties across kalpas are simultaneously reborn.

Receiving blessings in the Eastern Aurora Chamber,

The Eastern Aurora Chamber, also called the Azure Flower Chamber of Everlasting Joy, is where the Great Yang emerges. Benevolent transformation flourishes, and all beings find their proper place—hence 'receiving blessings.' Previously, it was called 'transcending blessings,' akin to Sudhana receiving prophecy in the City of Blessings. The East signifies life.

Returning to the womb of the Vermilion Fire Court.

Though one receives blessings in the Eastern Aurora, one must first proceed to the Southern Cinnabar Vermilion Fire Mansion to refine the body with golden liquid. Only then may one dwell there. The teachings of the Hidden School state: 'Divine immortals and human adepts who do not cross the Southern Palace cannot ascend and transform.' This refers to Mount Heng in the Southern Marchmount.

The numinous and pure practice of the Cavern Spirit—

When one realizes the numinous and pure Dao of the Cavern Spirit, one’s merit and practice become complete. The wondrous practice of the numinous and pure Cavern Spirit demands diligence, free from all attachments. If one clings, the power will not flow.

Power flows freely, naturally illuminating and penetrating.

When one attains the power of qi, it flows freely, thus becoming penetrating, enlightened, resolute, and strong. This is no ordinary power but the power by which the cosmos rests in the hand and the myriad transformations arise from the body—the power of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, which one must cultivate."

The Perfected One’s hands grasp the Dipper,
Pure and utterly true—able to clasp and draw the pivot of the Dipper.
This is not the strength to embrace mountains and leap seas or to lift hooks and shoulder tripods,
but rather the Dao by which one becomes the thief of Heaven and Earth,
stealing qi to offer to oneself, thus attaining great might and vast numinous penetration.

The feet tread upon the Nine Prime Stars.
The two feet may tread upon the Nine Prime Stars of the Northern Dipper.
The Dipper itself has seven stars, with two auxiliary stars, hence called the Nine Primes.
The scriptures say: "The feet tread the Northern Dipper, straddling the *kuigang*."
All lies in the mind’s contemplation, not in literal treading with the feet.

Wielding and grasping the gates of Heaven and Earth,
With qi-power flowing freely, one thus takes hold and bears the gates of Heaven and Earth.
The Celestial Gate and Earthly Axis are the pivot of the Dipper.
Day and night, the jade armillary and balance align the Seven Governors.
The Earth’s axis, three hundred and sixty in number, rotates in succession to turn the Wind Wheel,
driving the square earth.
Of old, Gonggong contended for the world and, in fury, struck his head against Mount Buzhou,
breaking the Earth’s axis—this is the meaning.
Here, "Celestial Gate" is spoken of, not "Earthly Axis," for it is a general term.

The *Yellow Emperor’s Basic Questions: On Heavenly Truth* states:
"The ancient Perfected Ones lifted and carried Heaven and Earth,
grasped and held yin and yang,
stood alone in guarding the spirit,
thus their longevity obscured Heaven and Earth."
This is of the same meaning.

This chapter speaks of the free flow of qi-power.
For power lies in nurturing qi:
when qi is full, power is full;
when qi wanes, power wanes.
Thus, one must value qi and secure its root,
only then can strength be attained,
enabling one to wield and grasp the gates and axes of Heaven and Earth.
The human gate lies in the two qi of yin and yang.

The root of spirit, life, and essence—
Essence is the root of spirit,
qi is the function of spirit,
and form is the dwelling of spirit.
If spirit is overused, it exhausts;
if essence is overly stirred, it depletes;
if qi is overworked, it severs.
Thus, the arising of form depends on spirit,
and spirit’s abiding depends on qi.
When essence is exhausted, qi dissipates;
when qi dissipates, spirit departs;
when spirit departs, form dies.

Compare it to a candle:
when the candle is spent, the flame cannot remain.
Or to a dike:
when the dike breaks, the water cannot stay.
Thus, essence and spirit are the vital connections to life’s pulse—
how can one not be cautious?
What humans must deeply cherish.

This chapter takes the free flow of power as the wondrous practice.
This power is not the strength of hands or feet,
but the Five Powers and Ten Powers of the Buddha’s teachings:
The Five Powers—faith, mindfulness, diligence, concentration, and wisdom.
The Ten Powers:
1. The power to rightly know what is and is not possible,
2. The power to know the karmic retribution of the three times,
3. The power to know the various meditations, liberations, and samādhis,
4. The power to know the superior and inferior faculties of beings,
5. The power to know the various desires of beings,
6. The power to know the various natures of the world,
7. The power to know all paths to their ends,
8. The power of past-life knowledge,
9. The power of the divine eye to see all,
10. The power of the knowledge of the exhaustion of outflows.
Together, they form the Fifteen Powers,
all recorded in the Buddhist canon—this cannot be denied.

The above Jade Chapter of Celestial Seal, one hundred characters in all,
above governs the Primordial Pillar of the Heavenly Ascension,
below commands the Fifth Mound of the Golden Millet Marshland Earthly Sovereign.

The *Mysterious Contract* states:
"When the Perfected One attains the numinous and pure Dao of the Cavern Spirit,
with hands and feet freely flowing in power,
grasping, wielding, flying, and treading,
coming and going with effortless mastery,
one can sever the evil roots of the Nine Dark Hells,
the earthly roots, demonic registers, and ghostly ledgers.
Ever offering the numinous tea, yellow sprouts, and golden stamens to the Primordial Heavenly King,
circling the Nine Radiant Steps,
one ascends to become a Heavenly Immortal."

The Heavenly Immortal cultivates the inner and outer Golden Elixir,
with merit and practice complete,
soaring through the thirty-six heavens,
surveying the wondrous realms of the celestial palaces,
abiding in bliss and freedom—
such as the Perfected Ones Zhong and Lü.

The Primordial Heavenly King says:
"The Eighteenth Jade Chapter of the Great Cavern of Wenchang—
the Cavern Mystery of Nature and Life, the Numinous Penetration of Primordial Destiny."

*Jiyou, Gengxu, Tripod, Thunder.*
The Central Yellow Primordial Qi—
This scripture establishes the Three Powers following the principles of nature and life.
Thus, the Dao of the Three Ultimates each has its governance.
If one can exhaust principle, fulfill nature, and reach destiny,
then one returns to the Great Dao.

Thus, when the heart arises, nature is extinguished;
when the heart is quiescent, nature appears.
This is called "completing nature and preserving it,"
the gateway of the Way and its meaning.

Yellow Primordial—this is the name of the Yellow Elder Lord.
This chapter speaks of the central intent of nature and life.
Thus, the spleen governs the central earth of *wu* and *ji*,
its color is yellow,
and its qi is also yellow.
The *Scripture of Salvation* states:
"The Yellow Emperor, Central Lord,
whom the myriad spirits cannot surpass,
regulates the five qi,
harmonizing the hundred spirits."
It also says:
"The Yellow Center governs qi,
commanding the Primordial Lords."
Thus, the root of human nature and life lies in the spleen and stomach,
which transform the granary of grains,
nourishing the Four Numinous Ones.
Then nature and life can be long preserved.
In the Dao of the Elixir, this is called:
Earthly Soul, Elixir Mother, Knife Point, Yellow Sprout,
Yellow Flower, Yellow Lad, Yellow Ox, Yellow Court,
Granary, True Earth, Yellow Matron, Earthen Cauldron,
Eight-Trigram Furnace, and the like.
Thus, the Five Prisons—all pertain to earth.

Of old, Xiang Ziwen,
during the Baoli era, served as an official in Hengzhou.
He met Gong Changqing, who said:
"My master, Sima Yinyuan, is a celestial officer of the Weiyu Cavern Heaven.
Human merits and transgressions are all recorded in the Five Marchmounts’ Cavern Heavens
and reported to the Envoys of the Nine Heavens.
My master transmitted to me the Dao of the Central Yellow Great Unity’s silent audience with the Supreme Emperor.
Now I cultivate it."
Ziwen announced his wish to follow and journey south,
but Changqing dissuaded him, saying it was not possible.
Yet, he departed in a flutter.
Thus, it is known that cultivating the Central Yellow Qi
can lead to the Dao of immortality.
This speaks of the Cavern Chapter governed by the Central Primordial Lord of the Round Flower and Yellow Perfection.

Round Flower, also called Yellow Flower,
is the stomach cavity,
also named Jade Longevity Spirit,
the deity presiding over the transformation of the granary of grains.
If one can transform the granary of grains,
then qi becomes harmonious and life endures.
Longevity or premature death—both depend on cultivation and accumulation.

The Supreme Zhang Shang’s Jade Gate,
"Supreme Zhang Shang" is the name of the Yellow Plain Elder Lord.
The Jade Gate is the Jade Emperor’s Palace within the human brain,
where the myriad spirits of the body pay homage,
where the myriad qi gather and converge—
also called the Heavenly Numen, or the Heavenly Valley.

Hidden clouds soar three *ren* high.
Those who exhaust their hearts know their natures;
knowing their natures, they know Heaven.
The "three *ren*" refer to the vast Great Luo Heaven above the Three Realms.
Thus, those who cultivate both nature and life ascend beyond these Three Realms,
and when the Five Clouds are subdued at the tips of the Three Passes,
radiant light shines forth.

The "three *ren*" also denote the clouds of three colors—azure, yellow, and white—
for the Left Primordial Lord of the Purple Plain, Yiyu Ren, is styled "Anlai Shang";
the Central Primordial Lord of the Yellow Plain, Round Flower Yellow Ren, is styled "Supreme Zhang Shang";
and the Right Primordial Lord of the White Plain, Qiming Xiaohe, is styled "Golden Gate"—
these are the Three *Ren*.

The Crimson Radiance veils the boundless,
the Crimson Radiance is the sun, the boundless is yin.
As the moon receives the sun’s light, so is it called the moon.
The incantation says: "Fragrant and veiled in the boundless."
The Sun’s Central Consort is named "Yang within Yin,"
like the Chamber, the Sun, and the Hare—
the hare’s four legs are even, belonging to yin,
while the sun belongs to yang, hence "Yang within Yin."
The moon’s crow has three legs, odd and belonging to yang,
while the moon belongs to yin, hence "Yin within Yang."
They mutually borrow each other’s principles in naming.
This speaks of the Consort within the sun,
just as within the human yang spirit there is a feminine aspect—
yin within yang, yang within yin,
exchanging and intermingling to form the flourishing of culture.

Uphold the Perfected of the Great One.
Constantly uphold the Perfected of the Great One,
for the Great One is transformed from the primordial qi of water,
ever dwelling above the human head,
dispersing true qi to form a canopy of purple clouds,
shading and covering the body’s form.
"Uphold" means to remain ever vigilant and awake.

The Emperor’s Daughter embraces the Stable Mound,
the Mud Pill, the Feminine One, the Emperor’s Daughter—
also called the Central Maiden of the Dipper—
constantly embraces the true yang essence-spirit,
named the Stable Mound.
Reciting the jade scriptures and cloud chapters of the *Great Cavern Immortal Canon*
draws down the true qi flowing from the heavens to give life to the human path.

Chant the *Jade Purity Canon*.
Reciting the jade scriptures and cloud chapters of the *Great Cavern Immortal Canon*,
as Sima chanted the *Cavern Chapters* to give life to humanity,
there is the Holy Mother of the Chamber, the Great Spirit overseeing birth,
with heavenly and earthly deities joining in the chant of jade tones
to supervise the affairs of procreation.

Jade talismans are woven into the Purple Chamber,
the Purple Chamber is in the Heaven within Heaven,
the place where talismanic charts are kept and administered.
As mentioned in the previous section,
this refers to the White Prime Lord, the Venerable Deity of No-Blossom,
who holds talismans and registers, presenting them before the Emperor—
all embodying the same principle, the principle of giving life to humanity.

The Five Registers mark the Round Court.
The talismanic registers of the Five Directions record the names of those who attain immortality.
The Round Court, also called the Heavenly Court Palace,
lies one *cun* above the Bright Hall within the brain,
where the myriad spirits gather.
It governs the soul and spirit to give life to the human path,
and so too does it lead to the attainment of immortality.

The Seven Ancestors return as embryonic immortals,
the Seven Ancestors all return to the womb to be reborn as immortals.
When a person is born, the myriad heavens celebrate,
the ten thousand emperors prepare rites—
only then is one born, for birth is not to be taken lightly.
Yet humans demean themselves, failing to cherish and preserve their lives.

Cut off the Three Paths’ corpses.
The *Scripture of Salvation* eternally delivers beings from the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Difficulties,
together severing and extinguishing the filth of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings.
The corpses are the Three Corpses—Peng Qiao, Peng Ju, and Peng Zhi—
dwelling within the human body,
constantly reporting sins to the Three Offices.
The Three Corpses reside in the Three Fields of the human body,
each corpse governing three worms, totaling nine worms,
which in turn govern the myriad worms,
gnawing at the body.
As the *Nirvana Sutra* records, each worm has a name,
though the list is too extensive to include here.
Within the eighty-four thousand yang pathways of the human body,
each pore gives birth to a worm.
When a person dies, these worms all fly away,
escaping to distant places and attaching to other things.

The flowing wind severs blood stagnation,
the flowing wind is the mysterious qi,
circulating throughout the body,
thus severing the stagnation of corpse-blood.
When corpse-blood congeals and stagnates,
only by obtaining true qi can it be circulated and dispersed,
preventing coagulation and blockage,
thus enabling the spontaneous transformations of life.

The mysterious work attains the Yellow Tranquility.
The mysterious work of nature and life resides in the Yellow Tranquility,
the name of the spirit of essence and blood.
The Three Births are styled "Yellow Tranquility,"
which is the central spleen-earth.
Earth receives the complete number of Heaven and Earth,
hence the principle of generation and completion ultimately depends on it.

The Cavern Mystery shines with pure light,
when the spleen and stomach are properly regulated,
naturally there is pure and radiant light.
Below, it says that nature and life are the primordial spirit.
The ancients said:
"Constantly call and awaken the master within,
remain vigilant and do not be deceived by others."
One should respond and awaken to this.

The primordial life achieves numinous communion.
The *Scripture of Spirit Generation* says:
"The primordial womb binds long life,
the evil roots dissolve and vanish."
For when the primordial life achieves numinous communion,
it perfects the Great Cavern’s Imperial Lord.

This chapter encompasses both nature and life.
The *Analects* says:
"Nature and the Way of Heaven cannot be heard."
Zilu heard but could not practice it.
This saying is excessive.
Among the three thousand disciples,
Yan Hui, Zeng Shen, Zisi, Ran Boniu, and Zhonggong
were all praised for their virtue—
how could they not have grasped the Master’s teachings on nature and the Way of Heaven?
Later Confucians take this as mere talk,
failing to examine the profound words and subtle principles
of the *Book of Changes* and the *Doctrine of the Mean*,
to explore their ultimate depths.
Instead, they claim that our Confucian school has no such learning on nature and life—
truly a shame.

The *Doctrine of the Mean* says:
"What Heaven decrees is called nature; following nature is called the Way."
The *Book of Changes* says:
"Exhausting principle and fully realizing nature leads to destiny."
How far apart are these teachings?

That which Heaven bestows and we receive at birth—this is it.

The root of nature and destiny stands firm. "One yin and one yang—this is called the Dao." That which completes it is nature. It is also said: "From sincerity comes clarity—this is called nature." Nature is akin to destiny. The *Book of Documents* says: "Able to illumine and exalt virtue." Virtue is nature. What the Buddhist teachings call "blessed virtue" is the firm and unshakable root of the nature school.

Filial piety perfects the enlightened king. The *Analects* says: "The noble person devotes himself to the root. When the root is established, the Dao arises. Are not filial piety and fraternal duty the root of humaneness?" Humaneness is humanity, and loving one’s kin is its greatest expression. In the time of Emperor Shun of Yu, the Supreme One descended to become his teacher, known as Master Yin Shou, instructing the emperor in the Dao of filial piety and fraternal duty. For above in Heaven, there are stars that govern this, and within the Dipper dwells the Perfected One, the Filial and Fraternal King, named Hong Kang, styled Bo Zhong. Long ago, Lan Gong of Qufu attained this Dao and transmitted it to Dame Mei; Dame Mei transmitted it to Grand Scribe Xu, and both achieved transcendence as celestial immortals. Those in the world who cultivate filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trustworthiness may attain this rank. Thus, the primordial *qi* is the Great Dao, and in the sun it is the Filial Dao Immortal King; the original *qi* is the Supreme Dao, and in the moon it is the Filial Dao Enlightened King; the mysterious *qi* is the Dao of filial piety, and in the Dipper it is the Filial and Fraternal King.

The Dao of the fundamental constants and human relations is naturally so—not imposed from without. Yet when those in authority govern with leniency and gentle instruction, filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trustworthiness may flourish. But if harsh governance and urgent demands press the people, they will be too preoccupied with mere survival to attend to ritual and propriety. As the saying goes: "Ritual and propriety arise from abundance; banditry springs from poverty." How can this be avoided? If those above act and those below emulate, from the family to the state, then under all Heaven, within the four seas, all will become loyal subjects and filial children. The *Book of Songs* says: "Their demeanor without flaw—this rectifies the four lands." Could this not be what it means?

In ancient times, there was a man named Tian Xuying, styled Liangyi, a native of the State of Qi. Of simple and unrefined nature, he served as an official in Hunan during the Kaihuang era. He attended to his parents with filial devotion and tilled the soil himself to fulfill his duties as a son. After his parents passed away, he received the register and methods of the *Great Cavern Scripture* from the Celestial Master Xue Jichang, reciting it without cease. Later, when Hunan suffered a drought and prayers for rain went unanswered, he was summoned to perform the rites. Liangyi arrived at the prefecture with disheveled hair and tattered clothes, and though he spoke not a word, rain fell. When the rains persisted unceasingly, he merely sat in silence with his headband removed, and the skies cleared. Emperor Xianzong of Tang dispatched envoys to summon him, but he declined and departed through *shijie*. Was this not ascension to immortality through filial piety?

Yuan-era native of Shu, Yao Wenqi, was of a kind and virtuous nature, serving his mother with utmost filial devotion. Though he passed fifty without an heir, while residing in Wuchang and traveling for office in Wuzhou, he encountered the imperial edict of Emperor Renzong, which declared: "Should you recite the *Great Cavern Scripture*, an heir may yet be expected." Later, after Wenqi had recited a thousand scrolls and presented memorials, a son was born to him the following year, named Wenchangbao. Was this not the response to his profound filial piety? For the *Wenchang Scripture* speaks of the Dao of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity as the Three Powers, all rooted in the harmony of yin and yang for the flourishing of life. If yin and yang are disordered, the qi and numbers become perverse, and the root of life nearly withers. *Wen* signifies principle and prosperity.

The root of life attains Great Harmony. The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called "life." When the root is nourished by the true qi of Great Harmony, this becomes the unceasing foundation of life. The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: "Why not consume the *wu*? The essence of Great Harmony." The *wu* is the universal Dao of the world. "Through non-action, ascend to the Upper Clarity." The *Book of Changes* states: "No thought, no action." This is the principle of spontaneity—the Dao of the Great Elixir, non-action that accomplishes all. Ascending to the realm of Upper Clarity, one beholds the numinous and true Heavenly Worthy. When the qi of the spleen ascends to the Crimson Palace, it is all the qi of Great Harmony.

Generally, the middle scroll employs the six roots as metaphors. The Buddhist scriptures say: "Not entering form, sound, fragrance, taste, touch, or dharma—this is called *Srotaāpanna*. One return and no return—this is called *Sakṛdāgāmin*. No coming—this is called *Anāgāmin*. Truly no dharma—this is called *Arhat*." In Daoism, these are the Four Fruits of Immortality; in Buddhism, the Four Fruits of Arhatship. Before reaching ultimate realization, one does not revolve in the cycle of rebirth, thus temporarily nurturing Great Harmony and wandering in the Upper Clarity, ultimately aspiring to the supreme fruit. Buddhist disciples, ignorant of the *mingzong* (life’s root), glimpse only the nature and dismiss the illusory shell as useless, refusing to cherish it. They merely cultivate stagnant emptiness and torpor, failing to unite nature and life.

The above jade script of celestial seal comprises one hundred characters, governing above the Heaven of Supreme Peace and the Imperial Cliff, and below the Fifth Fortress of the Lord of Human Virtue. The *Mysterious Contract* states: "The Perfected attains the numinous penetration of the pure and primordial mandate of the Great Cavern. From the Heavenly Worthy and Heavenly Emperor to the Perfected, Immortals, and Divine Beings—whether of heavenly, divine, human, or demonic realms—and all sentient beings, the root of life and nature is fundamentally all-pervading, unobstructed, and unhindered. It can sever the earthly roots of the Five Peaks’ hells, the roots of evil, demonic registers, and ghostly ledgers. Constantly offering divine water and numinous fluid to the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning, it nourishes the Mysterious Flower and ascends to the rank of Perfected Immortal."

The Perfected Immortal first refines the elixir and concocts medicines in the human world, saving the poor, reciting spells over water, inscribing talismans, performing rites for orphaned souls, and guiding the departed, ascending in flight like the Immortal Ge. The Celestial King of Primordial Beginning said: "The nineteenth jade chapter of the *Great Cavern Scripture* of Literary Flourish: *The Numinous Fluid and the Fount of the Numinous Fluid*—numinous penetration." *Xinhai, Renzi, Gen, Jian.* The essence of green refined above black qi.

The numinous fluid within the body is like water within things—though seemingly intangible, the ancients said: "Tears, saliva, essence, fluid, qi, blood, and liquid—these seven are all yin substances." Yet without them, there would be no means to nourish the root of life. The Youth of the Mysterious Radiance of the Great Tenuity. Also called *jingjing* (radiant essence), this is the name of the youth of the Great Tenuity. As this chapter takes the numinous fluid as its theme, it employs the youth of the Great Tenuity to disseminate the qi of radiant flourish, unobstructing the hundred passages and preventing the stagnation of fluid and vessels, thereby facilitating ease of life.

The Great Tenuity appears five times in the scripture: the upper scroll says, "The jade tally verifies the Great Tenuity"; the Great Tenuity Heavenly Palace. The middle scroll says, "The Youth of the Mysterious Radiance of the Great Tenuity," merging with the youth of the Great Tenuity. The lower scroll says, "Proceeding to enter the Great Tenuity." Above the Nine Heavens of the divine, there are also the Heavenly Emperor of the Great Tenuity, the Great Emperor of the Great Tenuity, the Great Emperor of the Lesser Tenuity, and the like. The divine transforms within the Jade Chamber. "Exhausting the divine and knowing transformation—this is the flourishing of virtue." The spirit of the body congeals within the dwelling of the heart, enabling one to penetrate metal and stone, enter water without drowning, and walk through fire unscathed. From ancient times to the present, this is the Womb of the Buddha-Mother, also called the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning in preservation.

Master Xujing said: "If you wish the spirit within the body not to depart, do not retain a single thing in the numinous terrace. If things remain in the heart, the spirit is not clear, dissipating true essence and harming sinew and bone. When the spirit departs, swiftly recall it; when the spirit returns to the body, the qi naturally follows. Doing this morning and night, the true embryo of the Red Child will naturally be born." The divine transformation refers to the myriad qi and myriad spirits in metamorphosis. The Jade Chamber is the golden house and jade chamber within the human body. If one can nurture it with celestial harmony, after a thousand days, transformation is possible.

The *Records of Immortals* recount that the Perfected of Pure Yang encountered an elder hosting a gathering. The Perfected said: "I possess a set of music. May I perform a piece to accompany the wine?" The host assented. The Perfected took a gourd from his waist, poured out twelve maidens, each holding a musical instrument. Two maidens bearing banners led the way, playing several melodies with refined elegance, their movements measured and graceful. The Perfected said: "This is the wondrous music of the Highest Heaven, unlike the vulgar music of the human world." The guests laughed and toasted with wine. The Perfected then returned the maidens to the gourd and swallowed it, saying: "These are the spirits of the five viscera and six bowels within the body. When the human qi is harmonious, the spirits are harmonious, thus producing musical sounds."

The immortal traditions further record that immortals often hear musical sounds within their abdomens. When one cultivates the *Wenchang Great Cavern* to this stage, there exists within the body a complete set of music, which those who nurture it well may also perceive. Is this not what the sixth chapter of the lower scroll and the fourteenth chapter refer to as "sandalwood blazing, the tuning of auspiciousness"? When this scripture is gathered, it becomes the precious *Canghu Jie*; when dispersed, it becomes the sound of "sandalwood blazing, the tuning." Only when yin and yang qi harmonize can sound arise—such is the flourishing of the Wenchang Dao.

**Soaring feathers traverse the purple void.**
The regulation of birds lies in qi. Thus, when the spirit-qi is refined and the yang spirit manifests its form, wings naturally grow, allowing one to ascend and delight in the purple void.

Formerly, Xue Jichang, a native of Hanzhou in western Shu, hailed from an official family. Fond of mountains and rivers, he journeyed to Qingcheng. His parents, deeming the distance not too far, accompanied him. Later, he traveled south to Taoyuan, where he encountered the *Zhengyi* Master on Mount Nanyue, who transmitted to him the *Register of the Great Cavern Scripture and Methods*. He delved deeply into its essential truths. Emperor Ming of Tang summoned him to the capital, where his discourse on the Dao and virtue met with imperial approval. The emperor bestowed upon him the title of *Tianshi*. Later, he begged to return to the mountains, and the emperor composed a poem to send him off, earning the admiration of the entire court.

One day, he said to his disciples: "Tonight, there is a gathering on Zhurong Peak, and I have been summoned to attend." Suddenly, he rose into the air and departed, never looking back. This is the *Great Cavern* soaring through the purple void. Lady Wei of Mount Mao once rode the clouds to Mount Nanyue, covering a thousand miles in an instant. When the clouds dispersed, they transformed into stone, which remains on Mount Nanyue to this day.

**The sun forms the triple *jin* junction.**
The character *jin* appears three times: in the first chapter of the upper scroll, it reads, "The dry landscape and radiance together give birth to *jin*"; in the eighth chapter of the middle scroll, "The sun forms the triple *jin* junction"; and in the final chapter of the lower scroll, "Carrying *jin* to the chamber of the Supreme Emperor." All share the same meaning. The *Triple Jin Junction* is the name of the youth of the Grand Tenuity, capable of generating fluids.

It is also said that the *three jin* are the three spirits within the heart: one is the *Spiritual Vermilion Lord*, another the *Spiritual Luminous Lord*, and the third the *Spiritual Yellow Lord*. The sun interacts with them. This aligns with the meaning of "the dry landscape and radiance together give birth to *jin*." The sun is the essence of the great yang, and within it resides the three-legged crow, which in humans corresponds to the *pi*.

**Bearing the talisman, ascend the Emperor’s ramparts.**
Once the youth of the Grand Tenuity interacts with the heart’s spirits, one should bear the talisman and ascend the jade city of the Supreme Emperor. The area behind the brain is called the *Jade City*. The third chapter of the lower scroll states, "Clad in rosy clouds, ascend the Emperor’s ramparts," which refers to the same—namely, the *yu zhen* bone in humans.

**Unlock the passes with the golden tally.**
Only by holding the tally can one unlock the passes. The tally is a symbolic token; when passing through barriers, one must carry it. At the pass, the tally is matched, and even the slightest discrepancy is deemed fraudulent. Tallies may be made of gold, bronze, or bamboo—here, it is called the *golden tally*, signifying its preciousness.

**Close the gates and strike the jade chime.**
The mouth, eyes, nose, and ears are all called windows, doors, and gates. "Closing" means to seal or block them. The *jade chime* refers to the act of striking the teeth: the left is called the *chime*, the right the *qing*, and the center the *drum*. Thus, to subdue demons, one strikes the chime; to pay homage, one sounds the drum.

**Vanquish the demons of the Three Feng wilds.**
The *Three Feng* refer to Fengdu Mountain, as recorded in the *Scripture on Subduing Demons*. Located in the northeast corner of heaven and earth, the *gen* direction, it is the gate of ghosts. Towering ten thousand *li* high, it is divided into three layers. The upper layer, level with the heavens, is called the *Upper Prime Six Cavern Palaces*, governed by immortal officials. The middle layer is the *Middle Prime Six Cavern Palaces*, ruled by the Great Demon King. The lower layer contains thirty-seven hells—thirty-six in the four directions and one central hell overseeing them. Hence, it is named the *Three Feng* after the Three Primes, and its vastness is called the *wilds*. Without the Demon King, the six yin and six cavern grudges could not be controlled. The demons beneath him are the lingering souls of defeated generals and fallen soldiers from past lives, fierce and combative, their killing intent unresolved. They band together, sometimes masquerading as loyal ministers or righteous knights, receiving offerings from humans, or acting as plague emissaries, tormenting living beings. Cultivators must guard against them, lest they harm the Dao. They may transform into beauty to ravage one’s spiritual root or steal one’s supreme treasure. Thus, one holds the talisman and register, strikes the chime, and beats the drum to wage war against the yin demons.

The *Three Feng* reside between the human kidneys, generally an extremely yin realm. As the *Triplex Unity* states: "Only when the host of yin is entirely stripped away does the warmth of yang appear." One must still battle and repel the yin demons before pure yang can emerge, gathering the lightness to ascend and transform, attaining the rank of Perfected.

**Summon the spirits to the Upper Clarity Palace.**
Gather and summon the souls to the true realm of Upper Clarity—namely, the *Crimson Palace* of the Middle Prime. Heaven possesses talismans for summoning the true and attracting the numinous, which can assemble celestial perfected, earthly sages, and the souls of the three realms. With these, congealment comes easily.

**Emerging bright from the Gate of Utmost Yin,**
This is the lower gate, the palace of the kidneys. One must exit this yin gate to ascend to the yang realm—this is the kidney qi paying homage to the heart qi. As the *Alchemical Scripture* states: "When lead encounters the birth of *gui*, swiftly gather it." This refers to the moment when the yang qi of the north stirs, instantly laying the foundation of the elixir.

**Entering the chamber of the Six Harmonies.**
The *Six Harmonies* refer to the space within heaven and earth. The *Commentary* states: "Beyond the Six Harmonies, the sage preserves but does not discuss." The body possessing the six roots is also called the *Six Harmonies*, corresponding to the *Zhouyi*’s "flowing through the six voids." Some say it resides within the human brain, where the spirits of the body gather. When a person dies, the hun and po occupy it, which is why skulls retain their numinosity.

Human essence rides qi through the limbs and bone marrow, hence the strength of the four limbs. During the union of man and woman, spirit and qi gather in the lower prime, and essence, riding qi, also converges there. If one masters the art of secret retention, the essence will gather in the *Six Harmonies* chamber, merging with spirit and qi into a single mass. It then ascends from the kidneys through the double passes of the spine into the *Mud Pill*, which is called "returning essence to replenish the brain." Thus, the eighth chapter of the lower scroll states: "The Peach Lord guards the Six Harmonies, restraining essence to defend the Mud Pill," precisely referring to this.

Many in the world practice what is called the "Art of Riding the Woman," also known as the "Three Peaks and Yellow Valley Method," or the "Bedchamber Arts," or the "Yellow River Reversed Flow Technique." Though these names vary, they all originate from the *Sea Bottom* and *Tail Gate*. There are five types of *Six Harmonies*, as this middle scroll states: "Entering the *Six Harmonies* chamber of essence," while the lower scroll speaks of "congealing radiance in the *Six Harmonies* chamber," "transforming chaos in the *Six Harmonies* sanctuary," "gazing from the *Six Harmonies* court," and "the Peach Lord guarding the *Six Harmonies*." Other texts expand on this, saying: "Restraining demons to generate the Six Lights," "the great center where the Six Qi are purified," "the Five Demons strike the Six Yin," and "fortifying my Six Immortal Palaces." This middle scroll focuses on cultivation through the six roots. If one can purify the six roots, the Six Lights will arise, the Six Qi will be clarified, the Six Cavern Demons will be subdued, and the Six Palaces will ascend to immortality.

Reversing aging to transform into a youthful form can make the body strong and light, preserve a radiant complexion, and restore the appearance of a child. Thus it is said: "Reversing aging to transform into a youthful form." Those whose white hair turns black again or whose fallen teeth regrow—such cases have been witnessed in the world, for cultivation reaches this level of wonder.

Returning to whiteness and reverting to infant youth. Another version reads "returning the po-soul to infant youth," which is surely an error. For when white hair turns black again and fallen teeth regrow, one resembles an infant child. The *Jade Scripture* states: "Those with white heads and wrinkled faces may all be transformed and delivered." By concentrating qi to attain suppleness, one reverts to the nature of an infant.

The Cavern Source is pure and luminous.
The Cavern Source is the deep spring of water, the origin of fluids. When pure and still, it radiates brilliance. Laozi said: "The clear is the source of the turbid." When the source is clear, the flow is long—unceasing and unbroken, day and night, cycling without end.

The fluids possess numinous efficacy.
The method of swallowing saliva: constantly use the Red Dragon to stir the Flower Pool, filling the mouth, then divide it into three swallows. Still, visualize an infant child in the Crimson Palace to receive and guide it downward. One such cycle is called "one passage." Thirty-six passages constitute "lesser attainment," three hundred and sixty "middle attainment," and one thousand two hundred "great attainment." With long practice, spirit and radiance flourish—hence it is said to possess numinous efficacy.

The scripture’s meaning of fluids appears nine times: in the upper scroll, "The body is nimble with myriad fluid waves"; in the middle scroll, "Fluids drift in the mysterious void"; "Embracing the elixir of fortune"; "Fluids possess numinous efficacy"; "Swallowing fluids generates the myriad spirits"; and in the lower scroll, "Swallowing savor generates the Five Sprouts," "The hundred joints receive fluids," and the like—all share the same principle.

Generally, human fluids serve to circulate through the joints and irrigate the viscera. Yet some despise and spit them out, causing the five viscera to wither, spirit to dull, and other ailments to arise, even leading to death.

Swallowing fluids generates the myriad spirits.
The spirit is fundamentally the one heart-spirit alone. Yet it divides into the myriad spirits, for one qi generates the myriad qi. Heaven and Earth are also one, yet within them the sun, moon, stars, wind, rain, thunder, and lightning transform endlessly. Likewise, humans: the eyes see, the ears hear, the mouth speaks, the hands grasp, the feet walk—all undergo countless changes. Thus, when encountering good, there is fortune; when encountering evil, there is misfortune. Nurtured, they endure; abandoned, they perish. Only with fluids do the myriad spirits have sustenance; without fluids, the myriad spirits depart and vanish.

The Flower Pool’s divine water fuses.
The Flower Pool is the mouth; the Red Dragon is the tongue. With the tongue, one stirs and gathers divine water, which naturally arises from the two orifices beneath the tongue: the left is called Golden Essence, the right Jade Fluid. When a person is ill, the tongue withers, the spirit departs, and the person dies.

It surges upward to irrigate and moisten.
Water’s nature is to flow downward, but when forced, it can rise above the forehead. Divine water, born below, surges upward to irrigate the five viscera, making the body’s complexion lustrous and moist—just as water does between Heaven and Earth.

It comes and goes without end.
From below to above, from above back to below, the Three Palaces ascend and descend, circulating ceaselessly. Human fluids are moved by qi: when qi flows, fluids circulate; when qi stagnates, fluids stagnate—thus illness arises.

It unblocks the source of the generative Dao.
Unceasing circulation is called "unblocking." When fluids flow smoothly through the hundred joints, nourishing the entire body, this is called the source of the Dao. Laozi said: "Water benefits the myriad things and thus nearly approaches the Dao." Water’s nature is yielding and compliant, hence it accords with the Dao.

The Heavenly Root is ever lush and abundant.
The Heavenly Root is also called the Spirit Valley or the Mysterious Female. Laozi said: "The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth." In the human body, the kidneys are the fundamental root—hence the name Heavenly Root. Those who indulge excessively in bedroom arts damage the kidneys; when the kidneys are damaged, essence has no support and leaks away. Excessive leakage scatters qi, and scattered qi leaves the spirit without a master—thus it departs, and the body withers, leading to ruin.

Therefore, those who cultivate the Dao must keep the Heavenly Root lush and abundant, cherishing essence and qi, nurturing them properly. This is the lifeline of the body—hence it is called the Heavenly Root.

The above Jade Stanza in celestial script comprises one hundred and ten characters. Above, it governs the Heaven of Manifest Stability and Ultimate Wind; below, it encircles the Fifth Rampart’s Lord of Human Virtue.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: "The Perfected One obtains the pure and luminous fluids of the Cavern Source, their numinous efficacy surging upward to irrigate the Flower Pool. The divine water circulates endlessly, unblocking the source of the Emperor’s Heart and the One Mystery—this is called the spirit within the true center, the Great Lord of Longevity. To the left, it generates the Peerless; to the right, the White Prime. Though their names differ, they are the Great One, the Controller of Destiny and Numinous Efflux, the Peach and Plum of Health and Longevity. They grasp talismans and hold registers, revere filial piety and uphold the Dao, perfecting wondrous conduct and preserving the true—such is called the Perfected One, whose rank attains to Sacred Immortal."

The Sacred Immortal was once in the world, slaying the wicked and eliminating harm for the people. With merit complete and the Dao perfected, their entire household ascended in broad daylight. Examples include Xu Jingyang and others.

The Primordial Heavenly King said: "The twentieth Jade Stanza of the Great Cavern of Literary Florescence: 'Essence and blood illuminate the Cavern; essence and blood possess numinous efficacy.'" Gui-chou, Jia-yin, Returning Maiden, Abundance. The Great Yang transforms the Three Mornings...

Firmness, centrality, and uprightness—pure and refined essence—are the abode of inherent nature and the root of destiny. In quiescence and immobility, they bear the deepest relation to both nature and destiny; how can they not be prized?

*Chen* is also a name for the sun, for the sun is the Great Yang, and the morning’s radiance is its chariot. In cultivation, the *zi* hour marks the Winter Solstice, corresponding to the *Fu* hexagram, when the first yang stirs beneath the earth. At this time, one should sit in ordered stillness, dispel impurities, halt thoughts, purify the heart, and guard the One, allowing yang qi to gradually arise and grow. By the *chou* hour, two yangs emerge; by *yin*, three yangs—fully forming the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams, ascending like a chariot. The Purple Carriage traverses the Mysterious Path.

The Purple Carriage is the solar wheel, where the Purple River Carriage transports yang qi upward into the brain. The Mysterious Path is the Double Passes flanking the spine, ascending to the Jade City Gate and congealing in the Mud Pill Palace. From here, the yang spirit may exit and enter. The Primordial Lord guards the Valley Youth, the name of the coalesced Central Primordial true essence and soul. The Primordial Lord is the Great One Primordial Lord, residing in the head, constantly blocking the Gate of Death and opening the Gate of Life to grant longevity. The Valley Youth is the Yellow Tranquility Youth, dwelling in the stomach cavity, governing the digestion of grain and dispersion of qi, transforming food and drink. Thus, the Great One Primordial Lord guards this as the root of the body. As the common saying goes: "Without root, food comes first; with food but no spirit to govern it, digestion fails." The Primordial Lord is called the Feminine One, for women who attain Daoist transcendence are all titled Primordial Lords, the most exalted appellation. Guard the stomach and seal the Gate of Death.

The Gate of Death is what people fear to enter. Essence and qi are things; the wandering soul is change. Once changed, transformation occurs—how can life return? What has parted cannot be rejoined; how can one not be cautious? The Valley Youth guards the stomach cavity, blocking the Gate of Death. When food is digested, the human path is born. The *Scripture of Attaining the Dao* states: "Still, regulate food and drink, dispel corpse-demons," and so on. Some say the Three Primes of essence and blood—Lord Wang, styled Yellow Tranquility—are the coalesced Central Primordial true essence and soul, the Guardian Valley Youth. Thus, this stanza centers on essence and blood, perfecting wondrous conduct and wondrous fruition.

The Golden Talisman illumines the Northern Splendor. Golden Talismans and Jade Contracts are refined from true yang, treasured by the perfected. Their radiance blazes like northern brilliance, resplendent as glittering jade. The North is one of the ten directions, hence the scriptures speak of the Ten Splendid Wondrous Practices, a sign of lung metal generating kidney water. The Jade Contract delivers the Seven Ancestors.

Some say "unfolds the Seven Ancestors," but this is incorrect. Only by obtaining the Golden Talisman and Jade Contract, congealed from true yang, can the seven generations of ancestors all transcend their kind, ascending to the Vermilion Numinous Fire Mansion to refine their souls and forge their spirits. Only then may they attain immortal transformation.

The Imperial True irrigates the Upper Birth, the name of the Imperial True essence and soul within the node. Also called the Infant, it enables one to be born in the celestial realms. The cinnabar lies in the first stirring of thought as the Imperial True. Thus, the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit* states: "Form the embryo and guard the Yellow Chamber." It is also called the Dark Terrace Birth. Sever the breath and end the Three Wretched Sufferings.

This was already annotated under the "Five Suffering Realms" in the *Tongue Chapter*. Within the Three Wretched Paths and Five Sufferings—amidst the Fengdu, Mount Tai, and the Twelve River Sources of the earth-water realm—countless underworld officials and jailers abound. These are often heroic and resolute figures from the world, bold and courageous, capable of resolving doubts and righting wrongs, greatly benefiting worldly affairs. Upon death, they become efficacious spirits, selected by the Earth Bureau to serve as underworld rulers. In the Three Wretched Paths, Five Sufferings, Nine Dark Hells, Fengdu, and Mount Tai, they act as officials of the netherworld, dwelling in eternal darkness, cut off from the Three Lights, adjudicating disputes and resolving uncertainties. Every three hundred years, they are promoted. This is the fate of those who, in life, neither understood the Dao nor performed good deeds, thus receiving such netherworld posts and severing their roots of rebirth. Those who cultivate the Supreme Imperial One True Dao of the Great Cavern of Literary Florescence distance themselves from such underworld offices.

The Cavern shines with luminous clarity, the original radiance of inherent purity, aided by fluids—all water qi. Thus, it is called the Cavern Mystery, Cavern Source, and Cavern Clarity. The Cavern Source corresponds to the fluid character, Cavern Clarity to the essence character, and Cavern Mystery to the qi character. The Imperial Heart penetrates the Great Mystery.

Attaining the Imperial Heart’s penetration allows unobstructed illumination, akin to the bodhi heart of Buddhism or what Confucians call the innate knowledge and capacity of humanity. By turning inward, gathering the heart-spirit, and congealing emptiness and stillness, one naturally gains insight. As Buddhism says: "Abide thus, thus subdue the heart"—the same principle. The Great Elixir is mercury, which descends into the lead crucible and is refined with civil and martial fire to congeal into golden liquid. Some take the Imperial Heart as the chapter’s theme, but the Seventh-Curve Patriarch’s *Mysterious Contract* designates essence and blood as the theme, so we follow that, for the heart is the mansion of blood.

The wisdom of past lives knows former destinies, kalpas before and after, past and future—all is clearly understood. This is the knowledge of past lives, the foremost of the Buddha’s six penetrations, which other immortals cannot attain. The root and origin lie within the center.

Tracing back to one’s root and origin, all stems from the central path: rectifying the heart, sincerity of intent, investigating things, and extending knowledge—nothing lies beyond. The center is the great root of the world. From center to periphery, purity and wholeness prevail, with the inner as root and the outer as branch.

The future and the minds of others—*The Doctrine of the Mean* states that the Way of utmost sincerity can foreknow. Thus, Buddhism says: "The Thus-Come One knows the myriad kinds of minds of sentient beings." It also says: "The past mind cannot be grasped, the present mind cannot be grasped, the future mind cannot be grasped." The ungraspable means one cannot abide in this state. Only those possessing the six spiritual penetrations can know this.

The so-called six penetrations are: the penetration of the heavenly eye, the penetration of the heavenly ear, the penetration of knowing others’ minds, the penetration of past lives, the penetration of spiritual states, and the penetration of accordant will. Possessing these six penetrations, one may know the karmic causes, powers, and retributions of past kalpas, future kalpas, and the three times—all without obstruction, fused as one. The three realms and the ten directions become unimpeded and unobstructed, merging into a single body. Thus, the *Zhuangzi* states: "The myriad transformations arise within the body." When the cosmos is at peace, radiance issues forth as heavenly light, and therein knowledge and perception arise. It is also said that only after attaining liberation does one gain knowledge and perception.

**Penetrating the Source and Penetrating Clarity**
In the previous section, *Penetrating the Source* spoke of fluids, while this section, *Penetrating Clarity*, speaks of essence and blood—both belonging to the category of water. If one cultivates and verifies these wondrous practices, one may attain the six penetrations in full and realize the fruit of non-retrogression, forever free from the fear of loss.

**The Myriad Ways Arise from Penetration**
The myriad ways and dharmas all arise from water. With penetration, there is nothing unknown; the affairs of past and future become as clear as pointing to one’s palm. Thus, many scriptures state that the ten penetrations arise from this. When the ten penetrations achieve true penetration, transformations occur naturally.

Some may find the meaning intricate and burdensome. Qi replies: When the Heavenly King expounds the scriptures, it begins with the stirring of numinous winds and the resonance of treasure-light forming sound. Collecting the sounds within the light and unfolding them repeatedly, they become profound chapters. The Jade Emperor ordered their sequence, and the Supreme Mystery compiled them. Only after passing through the hands of three sages was the text completed. How could mere discourse presume to match it? Thus, the sagely admonitions are earnest and repeated, lest even a single word among humans and devas fail to return to truth. Therefore, they are reiterated again and again. Those who explain it must follow the phrasing of each sentence. Though the text winds and turns repeatedly, it is only so that if one fails to believe and understand in one passage, one may awaken in the next. What difficulty is there in this?

The above jade chapter in celestial script comprises eighty characters, governing above the Heaven of Filial Purity and Radiance and presiding below over the Lord of Human Virtue of the Fifth Fortress.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: When the Perfected One attains the penetrating clarity of pure essence and blood, the numinous penetration of the *Great Mystery* and the true Dao of the Emperor’s Heart of Penetrating Clarity is born. Past kalpas, future kalpas, the three realms, the ten directions, the roots of self and others, past and future—all are known and seen with sevenfold penetration and eightfold reach. One can sever the waves of the Water Emperor Qi Bo, the winding springs of the Water Tiger, the sources of the Qu River, the earth’s roots, evil roots, demonic registers, and ghostly accounts. Constantly offering the golden liquor of *Penetrating the Source* and the dharma lamp of *Penetrating Clarity* to the Primordial Heavenly King, one generates qi to moisten the roots, achieving luminous wisdom, wondrous enlightenment, and great capacity, advancing to the noble rank of Upper Immortal of the Jade Clarity’s highest grade.

**Upper Immortals**
These are those who, having cultivated and refined the utmost truth in the human realm, ascend in broad daylight to become guardians of the Jade Emperor. They advance to the Great Luo Heaven as attendants of the Three Clarities, such as Heavenly Master Zhang.

The *Jade Clarity Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture* was proclaimed by the Primordial Heavenly King. Some may ask: Is there a difference between the Heavenly Venerable and the Heavenly King? Qi replies: The titles of the Primordial Beginning are manifold. Some call him the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, or the Primordial Heavenly Venerable of Spontaneous Chaos, or the Primordial Heavenly Venerable of Floating Black, or the Primordial Lord of Heaven, or the Primordial Heavenly Emperor, or the Primordial Qi Heavenly Lord, or the Primordial Yang Lord of Heaven. When the various heavens expound the Dao, each celestial being names the Venerable according to their own perception.

The Dao is originally without name and not truly possessed of form. Those who aspire to the Dao and rely on virtue, clinging to names and exhausting words, are not aligned with the Dao. Yet for those who have not yet understood, one cannot conceal it, and thus, out of necessity, it is set down in writing.

Before heaven and earth were separated, the primordial qi began to coalesce, taking the form of a chicken’s egg. Within it, the Being of Chaos was born. Seated at the center, it divided the clear and turbid, the yin and yang qi, above and below. Its head supported the Qian Heaven, its belly enveloped the Kun Earth. Each day, the Being of Chaos grew one *zhang*, and heaven and earth likewise grew one *zhang*. After ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety thousand kalpas, the two modes stabilized. From the qi of the nine palaces within its body, the nine heavens were structured above, and the nine earths congealed below. The spirit within the qi reigned over the nine heavens, and the numen within the qi governed the nine earths. Its heart and kidneys became the Kan and Li trigrams, the sun and moon; the true qi of the five viscera became the five stars; the essence of the nine orifices became the Northern Dipper; its breath became the Xun wind; its voice became the Zhen thunder; its fluids, qi, and blood became the Dui marsh; its body became the Gen mountain. The topography of rivers and peaks resembled the form of the Being of Chaos, hence their uneven heights—mountains and cliffs, peaks and ridges, all irregular.

The Being of Chaos ascended and transformed its spirit above the nine heavens, becoming the Primordial Heavenly Venerable of Spontaneous Chaos. The lice and fleas within its body transformed into the twelve earthly branches and twenty-eight constellations—such as *zi* as the rat and *chou* as the ox, or the Horn Wood Tiger and the Neck Metal Dragon. Dwelling within the Kun belly, their light shone upon the Qian head, becoming the stars and constellations. Its hair and whiskers became grasses and trees; its form became earth; its bones became stone; its tears, saliva, fluids, blood, and urine became rivers, seas, and streams. Only the harmonious qi gathered to form humans, their bodies hundreds of *yojanas* in length. Yet the human form was not yet complete—some had human heads and serpent bodies, others ox heads and human bodies—each drawn together by the resonance of their qi. Some flew, others walked the earth, ascending to heaven or descending to earth, going wherever they pleased. Some devoured one another without restraint. Thus, the Three Sovereigns arose in succession to govern them, honoring the Being of Chaos as Master Pan Gu. The Heavenly Sovereign, Earthly Sovereign, and Human Sovereign correspond to the *Cavern of Truth*, the *Cavern of Mystery*, and the *Cavern of Spirit*.

Thus, heaven, earth, humans, and the myriad things are all transformations of the Primordial Beginning’s singular nothingness. Each thing possesses the Primordial Beginning, for all arise from the primordial qi. Hence, it is called the Primordial Beginning. Only humans receive the most numinous of this qi. How great is this!

The form of all humans born today still resembles that of Master Pan Gu. Thus, when Fuxi drew the trigrams, he modeled them upon Pan Gu’s form: *Qian* as the head, *Kun* as the belly, *Xun* as the thighs, *Zhen* as the feet, *Kan* as the ears, *Li* as the eyes, *Gen* as the hands, and *Dui* as the mouth. Had he not depicted them as images but instead taken them as mere characters, it would still be evident that they embody Pan Gu. All are the continuous transmission of a single qi, passed down through his descendants and posterity—how precious is this!

Yet many in the world, through wine, lust, wealth, and strife, ravage the Primordial Beginning and breach the integrity of Chaos. Therefore, the heavenly spirits expound these cavern chapters, that people may chant and recite them, their natures and dispositions resonating to restore the qi’s wholeness. Only then can they reunite with the natural, primordial Heaven of Chaos, attaining longevity if they seek it, immortality if they pursue it, and effortlessly becoming perfected beings by nature.

Zhongyangzi Wei Qi bows in reverence.

*Jade Purity’s Boundless Supreme Perfected Wenchang Cavern Scripture of the Great Dao*, Scroll Eight
Annotated by Zhongyangzi Wei Qi of Mount Penglai in Eastern Shu

The Dao speaks: At that time, the Dao was truly pure, luminously wondrous, empty yet penetrating, spiritually unobstructed. Before Heaven and Earth divided, before father and mother were born, it stood solitary and alone. Within it, the myriad transformations of Heaven and Earth, the ten thousand affairs and things, were all indistinguishably commingled—myriad distinctions yet one root.

As *Laozi* says: “There is a thing, chaotically formed, born before Heaven and Earth. Silent and void, it stands alone and does not change, circling endlessly without cease.” This is it.

In humans, it is the heart. Its transformations are unfathomable, responding to every affair and circumstance. When still, it is nature; when moving, it is emotion. Emotion follows circumstances and shifts without end, transforming into desire. Heart, nature, emotion, and desire—these four emerge from the same source yet bear different names.

If one can be still and guard the heart, the original nature will naturally appear. But if one follows the flow of emotional desires and forgets to return, one will sink into the bitter sea of birth and death—how then can one escape? This is why the immortals and humans expound scriptures with the words of the Dao. The Jade Clarity Dao Lord unfolds the wondrous sounds of the Primordial Beginning, hence it is called “the Dao speaks.” To guard one’s nature is to be of Jade Clarity.

The Primordial Beginning Heavenly King, with the qi of the Great Cavern’s Highest Supreme, the Chaotic Cavern’s Supreme Non-Being, and the Primordial Heaven Treasure Jade Sovereign, as recorded in the previous scroll under the “Highest Cavern Primordial” passage, condensed it into a single precious pearl, called the Millet Pearl or the Maṇi Pearl, as noted in the middle scroll under the “Embodied Treasure’s Radiant Pearl” passage.

In this second section, once one knows where the Dao resides, one stands like a sheer cliff a myriad fathoms high, letting go with both hands, closing the eyes and leaping—sitting in empty space, neither touching Heaven above nor treading Earth below, vast and boundless, without limit or boundary. Within the chaotic vastness, one naturally attains something. The wonder of this attainment is like illness cured by medicine, like awakening from a dream, like obtaining a foot-long jade disk, like gaining a precious pearl. This is the moment when the Jade Sovereign’s qi gathers to form the pearl—how could it not be joyous!

In the third section, once one knows this place of joy, one permeates it everywhere, the entire body—hands and eyes—without obstruction. Yet upon reaching this point, one must not cling to it as self-satisfaction but must cast it aside. It is named *Canghujie*.

*Cang* is the true color of verdant yang; *hu* means great; the primordial qi is luminous and perfectly great. *Jie* means to rise straight and strong. Thus, the eleventh chapter of the Lower Scripture says: “The five qi govern the center with *jie*,” meaning the Primordial Beginning, with its supremely great and unyielding qi, condenses the precious pearl and names it *Canghujie*.

*Naming* is the mandate of Heaven. The flowing principle of Heaven bestows it upon the myriad things, and what humans receive at birth is called nature. *Canghujie* is the virtue of nature, for it arises from the pure, unadulterated spirit of firmness, strength, centrality, and uprightness.

It says: “I, with this precious pearl, follow the wondrous One of the Dao, generously bestowing the root of life.” The precious pearl has no form—it is the human’s nature and life. As the *Lunyu* says: “Nature and the Dao of Heaven cannot be heard.” How could petty immortals of lower rank be worthy to hear of it? Thus, the Primordial Beginning declares: “I, with this precious pearl, follow the Heavenly One—water’s register—to establish the root, thereby founding Heaven and Earth.”

*Generously* means water generously benefits the myriad things, thus approaching the Dao. Some say: “Follow the Dao’s wondrous goodness, the One that lends the root of life,” which must be an error. The One is the child of the Dao; when the Dao’s qi moves, it generates water, so the One is the root of Heaven and Earth, the eldest of all virtues. As *Laozi* says: “Only the Dao is good at bestowing and completing.” *Bestowing* is merely lending. Heaven and Earth, the myriad things—none do not borrow this to become the root of their generation and completion.

It conceives the Mysterious and divides the Primordial, giving birth to the Beginning and transmitting the True. *Conceiving the Mysterious* means containing the Great Mystery; *dividing the Primordial* means illuminating the Great Origin; *giving birth to the Beginning* means bringing forth the Great Commencement. The three qi of Mystery, Origin, and Beginning transform and give rise to the Three Treasure Lords. Father and son inherit in succession, master and disciple transmit the True—hence it is called *transmitting the True*.

The three qi: the qi of the Great Mystery generates the Blazing Yang’s Three Qi; the qi of the Great Origin generates the August Light’s Three Qi; the qi of the Great Commencement generates the Chaotic Vastness’ Three Qi. Together, they are called the Nine Qi, known as “the three qi uniting in virtue, the nine qi aligning in harmony.”

They transform and give rise to the various heavens. The nine qi each generate ten thousand qi, which in turn generate the Four Brahmā Seed Peoples’ Four Heavens, the Four Formless Heavens, the Eighteen Form Heavens, and the Six Desire Heavens—these are the Thirty-Two Heavens. Below these, they further generate the Eight Brahmā and Nine Heavens, along with the sun, moon, and stars arrayed in the void. The *Scripture of Salvation*’s five texts open and expand, universally planting divine spirits.

As the *Book of Changes* says: “The Dao of Qian becomes male; the Dao of Kun becomes female.” The two qi interact and transform, giving birth to the myriad things. From this point onward, humans and things flourish and multiply in abundance. Among them, humans are the most spiritually numinous and noble, positioned at the center. They should embody the Dao and model Heaven with their divine illumination.

They congeal into the ten thousand qi. This line should precede “transform and give rise to the various heavens.” The Primordial Beginning congeals the qi of its own body, unfolding and transforming it into the ten thousand qi, only then can it give rise to the various heavens. The *Great Golden Book* states: “The Jade Sovereign’s qi comprises ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine hundred million qi.”

Great indeed is this supreme treasure—only I alone exist. The Primordial Beginning declares itself, as in the *Book of Changes*: “Great indeed is the Qian’s origin—all things rely on it for beginning. Supreme indeed is the Kun’s origin—all things rely on it for birth.” The words “supremely great” apply only to Qian and Kun. *Alone exists* means to exist uniquely. Now, the *Great Cavern Scripture* stands above the two trigrams Qian and Kun, hence it is called the Non-Ultimate. The Non-Ultimate and yet the Supreme Ultimate. As the *Book of Changes* says: “The Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes.” The Two Modes establish their positions, and the Chaos Clan arises—topping Heaven and treading Earth. Chaos grows one *zhang* each day, Heaven rises one *zhang*, and Earth sinks one *zhang*—this is the Primordial Beginning.

Now the Jade Clarity Dao Lord reissues this treasure. As the *Book of Changes* states: “If not the right person, the Dao does not circulate in vain.” The Primordial Beginning long concealed this treasure, awaiting the proper recipient before transmitting it. The Jade Clarity Dao Lord is none other than the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, to whom the Primordial Beginning entrusted this great Dao.

This “reissuing of the treasure” refers to the fact that in the first year of the Dragon Han era, the Primordial Beginning transformed and came into being, and in that same year revealed this scripture. Now, the Jade Clarity Dao Lord reissues it—this scripture must have been expounded again and again after the Kaihuang era. The heavens and the earth each hold their fixed positions. As Confucius said: “Heaven is noble, Earth is base; Qian and Kun are thus established. High and low are arrayed, and noble and humble take their places.” This is what the *Book of Documents* means by “the Five Constants in proper order.” The Daoist scriptures say: “I am your root”—this is the same idea. Just as Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, first give rise to the Four Images, and then to the Eight Trigrams, which have been arrayed since antiquity through countless kalpas of dust, until Fuxi emerged, looked up and down, and drew the Eight Trigrams, only then were they made manifest. King Wen doubled the lines, and Confucius appended the commentaries—only after passing through the hands of these three sages was the system made vast and complete, so as to accord with the principles of nature and destiny, and to encompass the Three Powers in their duality. This *Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals* existed prior to Heaven and prior to Earth. Now the Primordial Beginning reissues it. The Dao waits for its time—how could it be lightly bestowed? The Dao Lord ascended and entrusted it to the Supreme Mystery Dao Father, and only after transmission through three sages did the ghosts and spirits of the Three Realms and the beings of all heavens and worlds come to know the origin of their existence. For from Qian they knew the Primordial Beginning and the One Qi of the Great Origin.

The Heavenly Emperor Kings and the Perfected Great Sages of the heavens gazed in awe at the treasure’s radiance. Its light spread into hundreds of thousands of millions of rays, coalescing into the *Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals*. The True Immortals lifted their heads to behold the luminous splendor, its brilliance scattering in patterns of light and color—hundreds of thousands of millions of boundless, inconceivable rays—forming the *Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals*. The *Jade Scripture* also says: “Concealed, it emits radiance,” and speaks of the “seventeen imperial lights,” all of which are the numinous light within one’s own body, enabling the formation of scriptural patterns. Another example is the Five Directions’ True Writings and Jade Chapters, all formed from the condensation of celestial light and divine qi.

The Jade Seal coalesces into clouds and shines forth in scriptural patterns. The Jade Seal is the ultimate treasure. It is said that its precious script coalesces into cloud-seals and its resplendent colors form patterns, illuminating the celestial Han with its revolving light.

The Heavenly Emperor Kings—such as the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors (Buddhists call them Heavenly Kings, while Daoists call them Emperors)—and the Perfected Great Sages of the heavens, upon seeing the cloud-script and jade chapters in the void, each employed their pure, luminous, and penetrating insight to recognize them. With their primordial Dao-eyes, they beheld; with their flowery tongues of mystery and clarity, they discussed. The Heavenly Emperor Kings and True Immortals, with ten thousand mouths as one, joined in chanting the cloud-chapters of the Great Cavern. Their voices resounded through the ten thousand heavens, their echoes flowing through the nine earths. The *Jade Scripture* says: “Echoes flow through the cloud encampments,” and also: “The Six Directions are near, the Three Luminaries are not distant—united in sound, their resonance penetrates the nine heavens and nine earths.”

The first three ranks did not mention the earth, speaking only of the heavenly Dao. Only now do the nine earths appear, for yang precedes yin. The nine earths are the nine layered earthly sovereigns:

1. Yuan De
2. Huang De
3. Di De
4. Wang De
5. Ren De
6. Di De
7. Li De
8. Fu De
9. Chang De

Each layer consists of one stratum of soil, one of water, and one of wind. Each has four Earthly Sovereigns governing the four directions, known as the Thirty-Six Earthly Sovereigns. Each has Earthly Father-Mother, Ancestral Rectifiers, Commanding Ministers, Assistants, Generals, and a bureaucracy of two-thousand-stone officials, all managing affairs with myriad subordinates. Above them, the Five Marchmounts and famous mountains hold the reins of authority. Each layer spans ten thousand *li*, yet the True Immortals in the lofty heights of the heavens chant the Cavern Chapters, and their voices descend to the Earth and Water Bureaus below. Thus all-encompassing, it may be called great—for the Primordial Beginning’s one qi circulates beyond Heaven and Earth, reaching without limit.

In the celestial realms, earthly realms, watery realms, and divine abodes, all spirits, without leaving their seats, beheld the dazzling cloud-chapters and heard the celestial hymns with their ears. The celestial realms are governed by the Upper Prime Heavenly Officials, the earthly realms by the Middle Prime Earthly Officials, and the watery realms by the Lower Prime Water Officials. Each of the Three Primes has its own jurisdiction, overseeing the sins and blessings of ghosts, spirits, and humans. Every year, on the first, seventh, and tenth months, they convene to assess and judge—no small matter. Thus it is said: “The Three Primes ride the morning’s return; the Great One’s Upper Prime qi.” From this, we know the first chapter pertains to the Upper Prime’s Nine Treasuries and Four Bureaus. Only the Great Sages of the heavens could chant the Cavern Chapters; the remaining ghosts and spirits of the Three Realms did not stir from their places. They could only see the cloud-chapters dazzling their eyes and briefly hear the celestial hymns with their ears, awakening to the Great Vehicle. For though the people of the heavens enjoy bliss, they do not awaken to the Dao. Now, upon seeing the Cavern Chapters, their hearts’ longing is fulfilled.

All obstacles from a hundred lives are extinguished; the dust of ten thousand kalpas dissolves. Pure qi forms Heaven, turbid qi forms Earth, and harmonious qi forms humans. Yet humans, since time immemorial, have drifted and circled within, unaware of how many tens of thousands of kalpas of dust have passed—sometimes as heavenly beings, sometimes as ghosts and spirits, sometimes as mortals, sometimes divided into male and female, sometimes entering other species. A thousand lives, ten thousand lives, emerging here and sinking there, rising and diving—who can count or compare? As the scripture says: “A hundred lives, ten thousand kalpas.”

Truly, it is so. Fortunate indeed are we today to regain the divine and wondrous principles of spirit and perception—how dare we not advance in trembling reverence, striving to extinguish the causes of past ignorance and unawareness? Once this heart awakens, all transgressions of past lives and this present existence dissolve entirely. If even ghosts may thus attain liberation, how could humans do otherwise?

As the Buddha teaches: *"All sins are like frost and dew—enlightened sunlight can dispel them."* That enlightened sunlight is the single heart-mind.

The Three Paths and Nine Dark Realms, the ten directions’ evil destinies—*the Three Paths are detailed in the middle scroll, extracted from the Five Suffering Realms below*—the Nine Dark Realms are: the East’s Wind and Thunder, the South’s Fire and Obscuration, the West’s Vajra, the North’s Profound Cold, the Center’s Universal Torment, the Northeast’s Cauldron of Boiling Oil, the Southeast’s Bronze Pillars, the Southwest’s Slaughter, and the Northwest’s Fire Chariots. Together, these are called the Nine Dark Hells of the Underworld.

The true immortals of all heavens and earths, along with ghosts and spirits, each hold their own ranks and duties, their positions fixed and orderly. Yet there are also those who administer punishments and rewards, rectifying good and evil: true immortals are governed by the Flowing Gold Fire Bells and Thunder Gods—termed the "Staff, Straightedge, and Law"—while ghosts and spirits are bound by the Heavenly One’s Northern Prison and the *Nüqing Tiaolü* (Statutes of the Green Maiden). For those in the underworld, merits and demerits are examined through the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, Nine Dark Realms, and the great hells of Fengdu. Thus, the ten directions and three realms teem with fierce and malevolent ghostly realms to carry out these judgments, scrutinizing deeds and retributions.

Yet when the radiance of the Luminous Sound reaches them, all ten entanglements, nine knots, six defilements, and seven dusts dissolve in an instant. The *ten entanglements* are the ten great evil sins: disobedience to parents, disloyalty to the sovereign, irreverence toward the Three Treasures, killing, theft, sexual misconduct, greed, anger, ignorance, deceitful speech, false words, harsh speech, and divisive speech. The *nine knots* are: betraying life, betraying wealth, betraying reproach, betraying trust, betraying others, betraying the nation, betraying whippings, betraying strength, and betraying gratitude and righteousness. The *six defilements* are the six senses—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—along with their objects: sounds, scents, tastes, touches, and dharmas. The *seven dusts* are joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, love, aversion, and desire.

All ghostly beings of the three realms rely on the radiance of the Great Cavern’s precious pearl and the resonant music of the *Tanchi Gou*, so that all worldly entanglements and defilements dissolve in that very moment—like seeking three years’ worth of mugwort to cure a seven-year illness.

Taking the human body as an example: the *Cang Hu Jie* (Azure Grain) is the millet of the *Scripture of Salvation for All People*; it is the single spark of numinous light within humans. Those who transform and give birth to the heavens are the five limbs, hundred bones, blood, and qi defenses of the human body. The emperors of all heavens chanting in unison are like the turning and flowing of qi and blood with each thought. The ten thousand heavens and nine earths are the human body from crown to sole. The three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Water are the three elixir fields. The dissolution of obstacles and dust is the harmony and smoothness of the qi-body. The Three Paths and Nine Dark Realms are the passions and desires of the kidneys. "All bearing the Luminous Sound" is the utmost reach of the heart-mind. "Dissolving in an instant" is the exhaustion of all defilements.

The true immortals of the heavens above the middle elixir field are the upper deities of the human body, while the hellish ghosts and spirits below it are the lower deities. If one cultivates clarity, these spirits transform into true immortals; if one is defiled by passions and desires, the corpse and filth become hell. Good and evil do not extend beyond this single body—whether one becomes a ghost or an immortal lies within the turn of a palm.

Thereupon, the Great Mystery Dao Father approached the Terrace of Xiao, bowed deeply, and prostrated himself, seeking to receive the jade scriptures of the *Great Cavern Immortal Canon* formed by the precious pearl.

The Great Mystery Dao Father, yearning and advancing, entreated to receive the cloud-scriptures of the Great Cavern. Know that these writings are transformations of one’s own true qi, capable of nurturing the vast and boundless. They fill Heaven and Earth, circulate through the Six Voids, give life to the myriad things, ascend to the Mud Pill Palace, descend to the Bubbling Spring, steam the joints, and refine the yang tally into jade scriptures. Upon completion, they revert to primordial qi, returning to the natural void.

Thus may they guide and transform the beings of humanity and heaven, sparing them from the ten thousand calamities, dissolving all sins, preventing their sinking into suffering, and uniting them in the One Vehicle. *"Loyalty and forbearance are not far from the Dao"*—the Dao of the Master is nothing but loyalty and forbearance. The Dao Father’s heart seeks to extend the self to all under heaven, making all beings one body with himself—truly a mind of universal intent.

*Dao* here is not the same as *Dao* in "to guide." The Dao Father entreated: *"From this moment onward, may we guide and enlighten the beings of the dusty world, humanity, and heaven, as well as all other beings. The ghostly spirits of the three realms have already heard and seen this truth, yet the beings of humanity and heaven have not. Thus, I specially seek to receive these teachings to transform them. If they but hear this scripture, they will be freed from the ten thousand calamities, thousand obstacles, and all karmic sins. From this day forward, they will no longer sink into evil destinies but will all ascend to the fruition of the One Vehicle. The ghostly spirits of the three realms who originally held immortal offices will all rise one rank, just as in the human world where grace is universally bestowed. Thus, both the hidden and the manifest benefit equally. If one can sweep away all root-dusts, remaining unstained by the ten thousand affairs and things, this is called the purity of a single body. When a single body is pure, many bodies are pure; when many bodies are pure, a single world is pure; when a single world is pure, all infinite worlds are pure—how then could there be any talk of beings’ calamities and sins?"*

With these vast vows, he earnestly entreated. Before the Primordial Beginning, the Dao Father labored diligently, advancing to inquire and receive the precious scriptures. The Three Treasures are most noble, and the true Dharma is rarely encountered—one must perform the utmost rites.

The Primordial Heavenly King commanded the Primordial Spirit Great Sage and the Jade Clarity Dao Lord to assume proper dignity, and with their own hands, bestowed the Azure Grain Treasure upon the Great Mystery Dao Father.

The Primordial Spirit Great Sage—sometimes mistakenly called the Eight Sages—is a gross error. How could one not know the supreme nobility of the Three Treasures? Moreover, at the moment of transmission, heart seals heart, mouth conveys and mind responds; the prohibitions are most solemn—who could presume to share their seat? If the Eight Sages were to intrude upon the assembly of the Three Treasures, they would scarcely escape the hurling of the fire-bells.

The Primordial Spirit Great Sage and the Jade Clarity Dao Lord should be recited as one phrase, for the Dao Lord is the primordial spirit of the Primordial Beginning. It is like the youth Sudhana in the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, who is but a transformation of Śākyamuni’s own spirit. If one were to place the Eight Sages above the Jade Clarity, how could the Three Treasures retain their nobility? The Dao Lord and the Venerable Lord would then stand beneath the Eight Sages—such a principle is utterly without basis.

In their full dignity of bearing, the Primordial Beginning, though already manifest as the Dao Lord, responded to the Dao Father’s earnest entreaty. Thus, the Primordial Beginning took his seat and commanded the Jade Clarity to transmit the scripture to the Dao Father. Thereupon, all observed the rites of reverent deference—gazing downward in humility, lifting their eyes in awe. “Majesty” denotes what is to be feared; “demeanor,” what is to be emulated. In their every advance and retreat, bow and gaze, the solemnity was thus. Then the Jade Clarity, with his own hands, bestowed the *Azure Grain Treasure of the Great Cavern Sutra* upon the Great Mystery Dao Father. From this, the successive transmission of the Three Worthies is clearly evident—how could there be any separate Eight Sages?

In human terms: the Great Mystery is the single point of true yang and primordial life between the two kidneys. The previous ascent to the Terrace of Emptiness is the rising to the Central Yellow Court. The seeking of the precious pearl is the union of true yang with the ancestral qi. The Primordial Beginning’s command to the Jade Clarity is the intent that the indestructible primordial spirit, through kalpas unbroken, should gather in the Primordial Palace. The bestowal by hand of the treasure signifies that the elixir is already formed.

From this, it is clear that the cultivation of this scripture is none other than the refinement of the great medicine of the golden elixir. The entire practice must be sought within one’s own body; one must not seek it externally and so incur reproach.

The Primordial Beginning declared: “This Azure Grain Treasure and the *Sandalwood Fire Lute Tone*—were it not for the Great Mystery, who could seek and receive them? Only your compassion is profound and your vows weighty; thus, the precious scripture may be entrusted to you.”

The Primordial Beginning further admonished the Dao Father: “When gathered, this scripture is the Azure Grain Treasure; when dispersed, it is the *Sandalwood Fire Lute Tone*. It is most noble and weighty. Were it not for you, who would dare to seek it? Only your heart is deeply compassionate toward beings, and your vow to deliver them is most earnest—therefore, the precious scripture may be entrusted to you. Between master and disciple in the transmission of the Three Treasures, the exhortations are most earnest and repeated, and the protection most solemn. How much less could lesser immortals of lower rank easily hear of it? I see that in the world, those who lightly transmit or secretly leak it, or who slander it, will surely face unseen retribution. This is an inner teaching: if one is not of the Great Mystery, even a single point of true yang can form the elixir—thus, the precious scripture may be bestowed.”

The Primordial Heavenly King said: “*The Jade Chapters of the Great Cavern of Wenchang*, Twenty-First Scroll: ‘Heaven One generates water, one mysterious practice.’
*Yi-mao, bing-chen, Travel, Xun.*
The qi of the Nine August Upper Perfected.”

The Nine August Ones exist in Heaven as the Nine August, on Earth as the Nine August, among the stars as the Nine August, and among the perfected immortals as the Nine August. In recent times, figures such as Zhang Pingshu were all Nine August Perfected, who, having erred in calculating the kalpas’ fortunes, were demoted to the mortal realm. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: “Recite it on one’s natal day to attain the Nine Palaces’ Perfected.” All are transformations of the primordial qi of the Mysterious Origin and Supreme Perfected—namely, the nine qi received in the ninth month, as mentioned in the preceding scroll. It also likens the nine palaces of the human head to the Nine Heavens, and the nine orifices of the body to the Nine Lands and Nine Provinces. Some regard them as the nine true qi: the one true within the heart, the two true in the stomach cavity, the three true of essence and blood, the four true in the liver, the five true in the spleen, the six true in the lungs, the seven true in the kidneys, the eight true in the gallbladder, and the nine true in the Mud Pill Palace. These are the nine qi of the Nine Emperor Perfected that generate the spirit, sharing a single origin under different names—the convergence of the thirty-six palaces.

The Four Celestial Governors are the Four Heavenly Kings. On the eight seasonal nodes, they command the Four Emperors of the Three Realms to refine and transform those who cultivate immortality. The Azure Lad presides over the Eastern Florescence Palace, the Upper Primordial Sovereign over the Vermilion Numinous Palace, the Queen Mother over the Western Florescence Palace, and the Jade Clarity Sovereign over the Northern Supreme Palace. They also symbolize the four numina of humanity: metal, wood, water, and fire. Earth has no fixed form but flourishes in the four seasons—represented by the earthly branches *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*—while *wu* and *ji* are the true earth of the center, called the Earthly August. The Four Governors are also said to be the Celestial Governors of Fate, Fortune, Wrongdoing, and Peril, while the Terrestrial Governors are those of Fate, Fortune, Merit, and Destruction. The scriptures state: “The earthly immortals of Heaven are the Celestial Four Governors.” For humans, the four governors are the eyes governing sight, the ears governing hearing, the nose governing scent, and the tongue governing taste. Confucian texts call them the five senses, which must all remain upright, unassailed by deviant qi.

The flying rosy clouds scatter the sun of Heaven,
Heaven is mysterious and Earth is yellow.
“Scatter the sun of Heaven” means each displays its true color. For each heaven has its own sun, moon, stars, and celestial perfected, whose flying rosy clouds disperse radiance, outshining the sun of Heaven. This likens the four qi of humanity to clarity and brightness, illuminating the primordial yang.

They congeal and blaze within the Six Harmonies’ chamber.
“Congeal” means to coalesce; “blaze,” to shine. The celestial perfected’s flying rosy clouds disperse radiance, congealing and blazing between Heaven and Earth. This likens the great elixir’s completion to a luminous brilliance within the upper field, called the Six Harmonies’ chamber—namely, the brain palace.

The Supreme Perfected ascend to pay court to the Jade Clarity,
The perfected immortals of the heavens must also compose their dignity and pay court to the Jade Clarity Supreme Emperor. This likens human cultivation to taking the center as its foundation, gathering the qi of the four numina to ascend to the Mud Pill Palace, called “paying court to the origin.” With time, one may govern as a divine immortal.

Riding the radiance within the dawn’s splendor.
“Dawn’s splendor” refers to the realm of the sun and moon—namely, the two eyes in humans. This speaks of riding the chariot of the sun and moon. The perfected, when ascending to court, all ride chariots, their radiance resplendent. The great elixir’s path involves the three chariots—ox, deer, and goat—transporting and refining, ascending to the summit of Kunlun. The celestial perfected possess the chariot of dawn’s splendor and rosy clouds. Later texts speak of “harnessing the radiance to ascend the absolute empyrean,” confirming that “radiance” refers to the chariot and the sun and moon at its sides. “Splendor” denotes brilliant radiance, describing the elixir’s ascent along the Yellow Path. The scriptures say: “The warm leaden crucible’s light pierces the curtains.”

The Five Celestial Bodies are called the Triggering Mechanism,
These are not the Northern Celestial Pole but the Lord of Essence and Spirit, named the Triggering Mechanism—namely, the five qi and five celestial bodies: *ren-zi*, *wu-zi*, *jia-zi*, *bing-zi*, and *geng-zi*. These are called the “Five *zi* Returning to *geng*” or the “Five Elders Opening the Way.” The “mechanism” is the pivotal joint: when the qi of the five viscera’s misty fusion triggers its articulation, they may coalesce into the four numina. “Celestial bodies” also refer to the supreme pole’s celestial cycles—epochs, kalpas, and generations—circulating endlessly between Heaven and Earth. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: “Revolving the Dipper and traversing the Winnowing Basket, cycling through the Five Constants.” The Five Constants are the five celestial bodies and five phases.

Bearing the registers to present to the Vacuous August.
The perfected each hold tablets and registers, recording the merits and transgressions of mortals. The Vacuous August is the Jade Emperor, who exclusively governs the affairs of the upper heavens and realms. This likens the true qi of humanity, gathering from the nine passes and hundred joints into the Mud Pill Palace.

Leisurely ascending the Purple Clarity,
The Purple Clarity Heaven is the sacred realm of the Jade Clarity where the Primordial Origin resides. “Leisurely” refers to the chariot—some say it shares the name *huilu* with the spirit of the nine passes, a term of profound obscurity. Here, *lü* should be read as a color.

The golden tally is inscribed in the Feather Palace.
The golden tally and jade tablets record the names of divine immortals. The Feather Palace is the light, floating abode transformed by Brahman qi, also called the “feather tone” of water. Without metal, the great elixir has no body, for metal is the elixir’s mother that generates water.

Receiving the dark-green barbarian pearls,
The perfected all receive the five-colored dark-green pearls of Cang Jie. This likens the elixir’s completion to the coagulation of the myriad qi, receiving the attendance of the hundred spirits in homage. “Dark-green barbarian” is explained in the middle scroll’s commentary as the lead and mercury of human nature and destiny.

Vastly aiding and ascending the Universal Radiance.
“Vast” means great; “aiding,” to ferry across. All must attain their proper place. In humans, this means vastly propagating beneficence to ascend the Hall of Universal Radiance. The sage’s intent is universally inclusive, ensuring all above and below find their rightful place.

Transporting and delivering the people of the Mysterious Center,
The Supreme Simplicity is the mysterious qi. Those to be delivered are determined by the kalpas’ reckoning without regard to fate. Those who accord with the Dao are to be delivered. The “people of the Mysterious Center” are like those in the *Scripture of Spirit Generation*, which states: “Several tens of thousands are destined to be delivered.” Having attained the Dao, one must emerge into the world to deliver others.

Swallowing and savoring the five sprouts.

Savor, then, is the fluid beneath the tongue, corresponding to Heaven’s Water. When those of the Mysterious Center attain the Dao of rinsing and swallowing to irrigate, they shall generate the Five Sprout Pearls—namely, the quintessence of the five viscera congealing into five flavors, sweet and pungent, fit for swallowing.

Gathering to form the Womb Immortal,
A woman’s gestation occurs in the lower field, opposite the kidneys, called the Womb Field. If a man constantly nurtures womb-breathing and congeals spirit-qi, he shall be free from hunger, thirst, cold, or heat’s disturbances. When the yang-spirit departs and returns, this is called the Womb Immortal.

The Elixir Mother preserves pure yang.
The Great Elixir’s mother is composed of pure yang. Without transmuting yin-qi, the elixir cannot form—this is called the Golden Tripod’s Dragon-Tiger Great Medicine. Kun is the mother, as the Scripture states: “Born in Kun, sown in Qian.” At sixteen, a woman’s celestial menses descend; at fifteen, a man’s celestial essence flows. At birth, humans are of pure yang substance, corresponding to the Qian hexagram. From fifteen, when essence is discharged, to twenty-five, the first line breaks into yin, forming the Gou hexagram. At thirty-five, the second line breaks, forming the Dun hexagram; at forty-five, the third, forming the Pi hexagram; at fifty-five, the fourth, forming the Guan hexagram; at sixty-five, the fifth, forming the Bo hexagram; at seventy-five, the sixth line breaks, forming the Kun hexagram—pure yin. When the yang lines are exhausted, death approaches.

Yin and yang harmonize, inherently possessing the principle of endless generation. Upon reaching middle age, when men and women are fully developed, one may cease desire and refine the Elixir Mother to preserve pure yang and restore original nature.

Host and guest unite in the primordial model.
The Chan gate states: “Guest within host, host within guest,” as when Sudhana visited fifty-three spiritual guides. Here, primordial qi serves as the host, while postnatal qi attends it. *Yuanfan* is the method—following the model, the compass, and the carpenter’s square.

To refine the Golden Elixir, one must guard speech, moderate diet, and reduce sleep—these three come first. Next, spread a thick sitting mat, loosen clothing and belt, align the body, straighten the spine, let lips and teeth meet, press the tongue to the upper palate, slightly open the eyes, and constantly gaze at the tip of the nose. None of these eight may be omitted; this is what it means to unite with the primordial model.

The Supreme Simplicity generates Mysterious Radiance.
The Supreme Simplicity existed at the dawn of primordial chaos. The Limitless stirred into yang, giving birth to Heaven’s First Water and the Supreme Simplicity’s qi—hence called *Tai Xuan*. *Xuan* means black, referring to the water-qi’s initial emergence, black in hue; thus, it is called Mysterious Radiance. This is the primordial spark of numinous clarity, called *nature*. From the formless, numinous life arises—this is called *spirit*. Spirit, then, is that which wondrously fashions the myriad things. Before entering the mortal shell, it flows above and below in unison with Heaven and Earth. Once embodied, it attaches to specific loci. Without this numinous essence, humans would be but inert matter. Spirit resides in the Mud Pill Palace.

The above jade verse in celestial script comprises ninety characters, governing above the Supreme Venerable Elder of the Heavy Floating Heaven and below the Sixth Stratum’s Iron Marsh Earth Sovereign.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: “The Supreme Simplicity’s singular mystery practices the Gate of Breath-Cessation. Qi circulates, first entering the root of nature, beginning at the ground of the heart. Gradually, it grows, flourishing into a forest. This arises from severing doubt and generating faith and understanding—hence called one degree of cultivation, one bend of water and sky. Performing a hundred deeds, one progresses from hearing to seeing. One harmony contains all, originating from initial hearing. Thus, the Heavenly Treasure reveals its radiance, the Black Emperor unblocks the blood, the Northern Dipper casts off death, and the name is fixed in the Mysterious Register.”

The Primordial Heavenly King states: “The twenty-second jade verse of the Great Cavern’s *Wenchang*, ‘Earth’s Second Generates Fire,’ pertains to the second mystery’s practice. Ding-si, Wu-wu, Dui, Huan. The Heavenly Sovereign’s primordial qi.”

As previously stated: the qi of the Nine August Supreme Perfections; now it speaks of the Heavenly August One. For the Heavenly August Great Emperor resides in the Purple Tenuity Enclosure’s Hook-and-Cord Palace, the position revered by all stars—thus called the most exalted among the stars, governing all affairs of the celestial palaces and constellations. Moreover, one *cun* above the Flowing Pearl lies the Heavenly August Palace’s Supreme Perfection qi, all born of the Primordial Beginning. Wang Bi states: “It is the womb-ancestor of the Three Origins, stirring and shaping all things.” This aligns precisely with this discourse, for it arises from the Three Treasures’ true qi of the Primordial Beginning, born of the Primal Chaos Supreme Non-Being Origin, the Vermilion Chaos Supreme Non-Being Origin, and the Dark Serene Mysterious Penetration Origin.

The Three Origins ride the dawn’s return. *Chen* (dawn) is sometimes called *shen* (spirit), but this is incorrect. The Three Origins—Heaven, Earth, and Water—each govern one hundred twenty bureaus, overseeing the transgressions and blessings of mortals. Thrice yearly, they convene to examine the ledgers, as recorded in the *Scripture of the Life-Spirit Chapters*, the *Three Origins Scripture*, and the *Three Officials’ Repentance*. The Three Origins’ scrutiny is no trifling matter, for they ascend to report mortal sins before the Jade Emperor, riding the radiant dawn’s chariot. This illustrates how one nurtures form and spirit with the Three Origins’ qi—what is called the Three Origins’ nurturing, the two images’ life-preservation.

The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: “The virtue of ghosts and spirits—how abundant it is! Though invisible and inaudible, it pervades all things and cannot be escaped. *Yuan heng li zhen*: bending and stretching, advancing and retreating, fortune and misfortune arise from mutual resonance. The retribution of transgressions and blessings lies herein. Though it stems from mortal summoning, ghosts and spirits indeed oversee their allotment.”

The Dharma Enclosure ascends the Vermilion Empyrean. This was explained in Chapter Ten of the middle volume: the Vermilion Empyrean is the Crimson Empyrean, one of the Nine Empyreans. The Great Cinnabar’s luminous qi opens the Great Cinnabar’s heaven, congealing the Crimson Empyrean’s palace in the south. The Dharma Enclosure encompasses the Purple Tenuity, Supreme Tenuity, and Celestial Market heavens.

The Emperor prospers, opening the Jade Gate. The Nine Perfected of the Mud-Pill Palace, the August Emperor of Prosperity, bears the primordial name *Xianlingyuan*. At this time, the Jade Portal opens to receive them. Qi follows spirit’s journey, all returning to the Gate of Myriad Mysteries. As Chan Buddhism says: “Possess another eye to see”—this is precisely it.

Extract the corpse’s qi from within the Gate of Life. Draw forth the corpse’s foul qi, severing it from the Gate of Life. The right kidney is called the Gate of Life, the crux of the body’s vital pulse. Those who fail to honor their qi and secure their root, indulging in lust and desire to agitate the Gate of Life, court death.

Unbind the knots at the Peach Prosperity Stair. Dissolve the obstructions and root-tethers at the Peach Prosperity Stair. Peach Prosperity refers to the true qi’s correct spirit, the kidney spirit named *Heyan*, also called *Xuanming* or *Yuying*—a single spirit with two names, or two spirits with one name.

Gather the spirit to guard the Five Registers. Collect the myriad spirits of the body to safeguard the Five Viscera. Above, they correspond to the Five Stars; at the center, to the Five Qi; below, to the Five Marchmounts. All possess ledgers recording the immortal names of those who attain the Dao.

Ascend through turns into the Supreme Tenuity. The Supreme Tenuity is the Southern Dipper’s enclosure. Only by passing through the Three Realms’ protection and recommendation may one enter the Supreme Tenuity. All proceed from lower to higher, advancing step by step. From the Supreme Tenuity, one ascends to the Three Bounds, becoming a minister in attendance upon the Three Clarities.

Single entry, dual cultivation. Entering the Dao with one body, cultivate both merit and wisdom, benefiting the hidden and the manifest. This illustrates how one preserves the clarity of sincere mindfulness, investigating the subtleties of a single aperture. Thus, the precelestial and postcelestial qi merge into one family, forged into a single whole.

A bend of water and sky heard. Initially, Heaven One generates Water, whence Earth Two generates Fire. Below, it speaks of the Sea Sun. Water’s nature flows downward through the earth, yet its resonance answers to the celestial realm. The unheard hearing—let the noble person fear what they do not hear. Whispers in the human world are heard in heaven like thunder. How much more in the dark chamber’s seclusion, where ten eyes watch and ten hands point—dare one not fear!

The solitary crane cries in the Nine Marshes, its voice heard in heaven. When the cultivator attains utmost stillness, not a single sound in heaven or earth escapes their awareness. All is known, all is heard. Some interpret *heard* as *opened*.

The Sea Sun rises from the east. Earth Two generates Fire, hence the Sea Sun. The sun emerges from the Eastern Sea’s Fusang Mountain. This illustrates how, when one seeks to form the embryo, yin and yang qi coalesce within the self. Only when the six yang are complete—forming the *Qian* hexagram—does the body’s form take shape.

The primordial life ascends to the Great Beginning. *Yuanming* (primordial life) is primordial qi. Heaven’s root lies in Heaven One, extending to Earth Two—the inception of form and qi’s portents. Mortal life’s root lies in the intercourse of essence and qi. Only when true yang congeals does the embryo form, transforming into the Great Beginning’s pre-formative state.

To discourse on nature without qi is incomplete; to discourse on qi without nature is unclear. Nature is spirit, belonging to yin; life is qi, belonging to yang. Cultivating nature without life leaves one’s dwelling prone to decay. Cultivating life without nature, though one may live for millennia, ultimately fails to grasp the wondrous principle. Thus, dual cultivation of nature and life is the supreme immortal fruit.

The above jade verse comprises sixty celestial seal-characters, governing above the Thought-Free River’s Heavenly Flow and commanding below the Sixth Rampart’s Earth Virtue Lord.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: “The Great Beginning’s second origin’s wondrous practice of the Breath-Resting Gate. Contemplate the arising of the nature-mind’s movement to grasp nature’s mechanism. Thoughts of faith must not be forgotten; faith must not be lost in guarding. Act for the sake of faith. When the Five Faiths reside within, the heart harmonizes and sight harmonizes—thus called the second degree, the second spark of Earth’s Fire. Perform five hundred deeds, progressing from seeing to observing. When observation stabilizes, the spirit clarifies; when the spirit clarifies, the qi purifies. Only then is it named correct observation. The two harmonies contain and gather the spirit’s eyes and square pupils. Thereby, the Numinous Treasure opens the long night’s darkness, and the Red Emperor nurtures the qi of thorough harmony.”

The Southern Dipper’s upper register inscribes the cinnabar script.

The Primordial Heavenly King states: “The twenty-third jade verse of the Great Cavern’s *Wenchang*, ‘Heaven Three Generates Wood,’ pertains to the third origin’s wondrous practice.”

On the days *jiwei*, *gengshen*, at the seasonal nodes and during *Zhongfu*. The Supreme Unity’s Upper Primordial Qi—this chapter is absent from the Mao Shan *Jade Canon*. The Supreme Unity was noted earlier; previously, the Upper Perfected Qi appeared twice, and today it is the Upper Primordial Qi. The Mud-Pill Palace is also called the Upper Primordial Palace, governing the affairs of the Celestial Treasury. Some say it is forbidden, though this holds no meaning.

Within the Sun’s center dwells the Youth of the Controller of Destiny. In the Palace of Grand Yang resides the Lord of Destiny Who Receives Life, styled *Daoling*, also called the Numinous Youth of the Controller of Destiny. This metaphor refers to the human heart, which belongs to yang. The Controller of Destiny is the spirit of the heart, also named *Danyuan*, styled *Shouling*. This chapter speaks of the heart as fire, born of wood. The mother conceals the child in the womb—a technique of the Five Phases’ inversion. The dragon emerges from within fire. As the *Yin Fu Jing* states: “Fire is born of wood, and calamity arises to restrain it.” Fire is generated within wood, yet it turns to burn the fuel. In worldly affairs, this brings harm through reversal; in the Dao of the Elixir, wood as three and fire as two make five, containing the mechanism of transformation.

Radiant, the spirit’s light shines bright. The heart is the image of *li* brightness, the mansion of numinous clarity—its divine light blazes resplendent. Cultivating this *Wenchang Great Cavern* is like polishing a pearl from mud, wiping a mirror free of dust, or blowing embers in a cold furnace—only to restore its original luminosity.

Clad in rosy clouds, one ascends the Emperor’s ramparts. The clouds appear in five hues: crimson, cinnabar, deep red, vermilion, and purple—all yang qi. This speaks of the heart-spirit donning these rosy clouds to ascend the ramparts of the Jade Emperor’s palace in the Mud-Pill. As noted earlier, the characters often reveal overlapping meanings.

Arrayed in seats upon the *Zhen* numinous mat. The myriad spirits are seated in ranks upon the mat of *Zhen*, the east’s Wood virtue, the place of burgeoning life qi. “The Emperor emerges from *Zhen*”—this is the Lesser Yang’s position.

Below, the two *Zhen* numina are seen. Here, the trigrams *Kan*, *Li*, and *Zhen* are observed.

Harmonizing within the Five-Day Chamber. Five days make one *hou*. The spirit and essence merge within the Purple Chamber; only after five days do they return to their respective palaces. In the Great Elixir’s Dao, a moment’s effort can ascend one to sagehood. This refers to the firing times, which must be guarded with days and hours—advancing and withdrawing, adding and reducing.

The *Analects* states: “Choosing the Mean, yet unable to hold it for even a month.” Yan Hui, as a person, chose the Mean and, having attained one good, grasped it firmly and never lost it. It also says: “Yan Hui’s heart did not stray from benevolence for three months.” Once one obtains this wondrous aperture, one must guard it with effort—even for a lifetime. Why be bound by a single *hou*? The five days also correspond to the Five Emperors dispersing the essence of the sun, and the sun’s center opening its five radiant beams—these are of the same meaning.

The *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* says: “For seven days and nights, the sun, moon, and stars of all heavens halt their wheels.” All these describe the coagulation of spirit and qi, the blending of yin and yang within the Hollow Cavern. The eyes do not blink, the heart is still and settled—this is the way.

White qi nurtures *Shangsheng*. The One Primordial White Qi Lord within the womb is named *Yushangsheng*, styled *Shengchang*, also called *Xuanguizi*. A later chapter states: “The Right Assistant returns to *Shengchang*.” The *Chapter on Generating the Spirit* says: “Devote yourself to *Xuanyu Shangsheng*,” and also refers to the names of the Jade Emperor of the Brain Palace.

The Azure Lord presses *Yanchang*. The Azure Qi Lord of the Center, *Anyanchang*, styled *Heheying*, rides the qi of Jupiter, the Wood virtue of the east, flowing forth the true qi of life to descend and infuse the human body and the liver regions of all beings, generating the essence of the Three Hun.

On the left, he carries *Jingshangmen*. The Black Qi Lord of the Nodes, *Fulaisheng*, styled *Jingshangmen*, is carried by the Azure Lord to generate the left-eye youth named *Feiling*, which in the head is the sun. The sun has nine-colored rays, brilliant and dazzling, forming the Nine Hun Perfected.

On the right, he embraces *Heheying*. The White Qi Lord embraces the Azure Qi *Heheying*, uniting with the qi of Grand Harmony to generate the right-eye youth *Chenying*, which in the head is the moon. The moon has fourteen luminous essences, clear and lustrous, forming the Seven Po Perfected.

I give birth to the sun and moon’s splendor. The human eyes alternate like the sun and moon, and the heart of heaven and earth is never obscured—how could the world lie beyond me? The Dao of heaven flows and transforms, giving life to the myriad things. All that fills heaven and earth with sound, color, form, and appearance are things. Since things exist, there must be their inherent principles, which cannot be otherwise. This is what heaven bestows, not what humans can fabricate.

The *Book of Songs* says: “Heaven gives birth to the teeming people; there are things, there are principles. The people hold fast to the constant; they love this excellent virtue.” All things under heaven are complete within me. When the two qi are complete in the body, the eyes shine like the sun and moon’s radiance. In the Golden Elixir, this is called the union of sun and moon.

The *Cantong Qi* states: “The two crescents unite their essence; the body of Qian and Kun is thus formed.” It also says: “Between the dark and new moons, chaos and vast obscurity—yin and yang qi are complete. This is the time of the sun and moon’s union.” Lü Dongbin said: “Upon the winding river, the moon’s radiance is pure and bright; a crow flies there.”

The Crimson Qi King, *Youbao*. “Friend” (*you*) takes harmony, “treasure” (*bao*) takes preciousness. The Crimson Qi King is the spirit of the heart, which one must cherish, keeping it tranquil and harmonious. Some say *Youbao* is the style of the Crimson Qi King, signifying the principle of the numinous terrace’s emptiness and clarity.

The Eight Sceneries illuminate the Mud-Pill. The Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries refer to the twenty-four vertebrae of the spine, passing through their joints to shine upon the Mud-Pill. The inner names of the Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries’ spirits are hidden and tabooed—recorded in the middle scroll. Through human concentration, the numinous clarity comes of itself.

Brilliant within the Cavern Chamber. The Cavern Chamber lies within the Brain Palace. The true qi of Primordial Yang ascends from the twenty-four nodes to the Cavern Chamber, brightly illuminating the Eight Chambers. From here, one gazes down upon the Six Poles’ realm as if in the palm of the hand—so-called “the Three Realms are not distant.”

The Infant is the Red Child—the spirit of the Lower Elixir Field is named the Infant, like a newborn babe. Through cultivating this Dao, I return to the state of infancy, and the infant further transforms into Mysterious Qi. As the *Tradition* states: "Cherish the heart of the Red Child; earnestly seek it, and though you may not hit the mark, you shall not be far off."

Commingling gives birth to the Jade Countenance. When Kan and Li unite in intercourse, Water and Fire achieve harmony, Yin and Yang merge, and the Elixir congeals. Nurtured in the Primordial Palace with proper warmth, refined through timely withdrawal and addition, it accumulates within and manifests without—seen upon the face, flourishing upon the back.

The Five Paths bring forth Golden Splendor. The Five Paths are the Five Phases, embodied in Earth yet with qi coursing through Heaven. As the Five Viscera reside within, the Five Qi surge outward—thus do all Five Viscera radiate brilliance. Golden Splendor is the name of a mountain in Heaven.

Ranked as a Lord of Supreme Clarity. One is enfeoffed in the realm of the Upper Clarity, attaining the noble rank of Immortal Lord. The titles Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount, and Baron correspond to the five human ranks, just as the Upper Clarity’s Central Cavity is where the myriad qi settle into a single locus to form the Elixir.

The Seven Ancestors sever Mysterious Obstructions. For the Seven Ancestors and Nine Mysteries whose bonds remain unbroken, this practice severs them like a blade, liberating all at once. The gates of darkest night dissolve without hindrance, allowing ascent to the celestial realms in shared flight, where one attains sagehood and becomes a Perfected—joyous and free.

The Body-Spirit rides the Immortal Wind. The spirit of the body soars lightly, like Liezi riding the wind. In the era of the Three Sovereigns, people were often weightless, traversing the void. Later generations, consuming the five grains and rich flavors, grew heavy and lost the power of flight.

Roaming above the Three Clarities. One wanders leisurely above the Three Clarities, dwelling in their realm yet journeying to their heavens. In life, one may roam the spirit through the Three Fields; in death, one may ascend to the Three Clarities’ domain, above the Thirty-Two Heavens in the Great Canopy.

Harmonious joy returns to the Embryonic Infant. The *Book of Changes* states: "The Dao of Qian transforms and changes, each rectifying its nature and destiny, preserving the Great Harmony." Here, in the Great Cavern, one reverts from old age to infancy, harmonious and blissful. Nurturing the harmonious qi, the Infant spontaneously arises within the navel and abdomen, as if in gestation.

The Great Beginning’s Three Qi cycle. The Supreme Simplicity, Supreme Origin, and Supreme Beginning—these are the Great Mystery, Great Origin, and Great Beginning. When the Three Qi of Mystery, Origin, and Beginning are complete, they become the root of Heaven and Earth. At this stage of human life, all boundaries are established; the Elixir, too, reaches this state when the Fire Times are fulfilled.

The True Scriptures inaugurate luminous clarity. The True Scriptures resemble the cloud-seals of the Five Directions. Refined in the Yang Cavern’s hall and smelted in the Flowing Fire’s court, they first take form. The Heavenly Perfected inscribed them to stabilize Heaven and Earth. This *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture* was formed when the Primordial Heavenly King condensed the qi of the Primal Chaos and Supreme Non-Being into a pearl. The pearl’s radiance dispersed into billions, congealing into clouds and unfolding into patterns, evolving into the *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture*. Its True Scripts and precious talismans originate here. When the Five Viscera are fully formed in a person, it is called the "Opening of the Five Scripts," for the Five Spirits each guard the essence of the Five Viscera—hence the term "Script."

The above Jade Stanzas of Heavenly Seal comprise one hundred twenty characters. Above, they govern the Supreme Purity of Ruanle Heaven; below, they command the Lord of Earthly Virtue of the Sixth Stratum.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: "The Three Qi of the Great Beginning wondrously traverse the Gate of Contemplation. Fixed records are inscribed on metal and stone; perfect faith achieves great completion. Those of virtuous faith can cultivate; steadfast faith advances progress—only then is it called true faith. When the Ten Faiths are complete, harmony of intent generates extended qi; harmony of will brings great benefit; harmony of qi perfects the Three Qi. This is called the Three Degrees within the Three Perfected, the celestial reckoning of a thousand great merits. From hearing one enters vision; from vision one enters penetration. Thus is the Spirit Treasure governed, the myriad spirits restrained, the Azure Emperor safeguarding the soul’s clarity. The Eastern Dipper inscribes the tally of longevity; the Lord of Wood records names on the Azure Tablets."

The Primordial Heavenly King said: "This is the twenty-fourth Jade Stanza of the Great Cavern’s Literary Splendor. Earth gives birth to Metal in the Fourfold; the Four Brahmā wondrously traverse. Xin-You, Ren-Xu, Minor Excess, and After Completion."

Within the Yellow Chamber of the Primordial Spirit...

This stanza takes Metal as its governing element, its color yellow, corresponding to the central spleen-viscera. The Yellow Chamber is the Yellow Court, as the *Book of Changes* states: "The noble one, centered in yellow, penetrates the principles and occupies the proper position within the body." This is precisely what is meant here—Primordial Spirit signifies emptiness and luminous clarity. Within it resides the Yellow Serenity Youth.

The Three Perfected Sovereigns of Essence and Blood, the Primordial King of the Yuan, styled Yellow Serenity Master of the Mysterious, dwells in the Yellow Chamber, presiding over the transformation of the water-and-grain repository. Clad in brocade robes and yellow skirts, he sits upon a golden terrace, encircled by walls and ramparts—this is also called the Great Granary.

To his left is the Firm Jade Lord: the Two Perfected of the Stomach Cavity, Firm Jade Lord, styled Congealed Feather Pearl, guarding the left of the stomach cavity. He governs the stomach’s qi and water-grain, nourishing the four limbs, rendering them firm as gold and jade, while his true qi spreads like azure clouds, descending to suffuse the Great Granary.

To his right is the Imperial Prosperity August One: the Nine Perfected of the Mud-Pellet Palace, Imperial Prosperity Supreme August, styled Primordial Spirit of the First, guarding the right of the spleen and stomach. He distributes water-grain, irrigating the five viscera and the flesh, causing them to flourish. Some texts call him the Imperial Prosperity Youth, which is surely an error, for he should not be redundantly termed a "youth."

The floating yellow haze of spirit-qi—spleen qi pertains to Earth, Earth’s color is yellow, and true qi steams and veils, shading the spirit-brilliance of the lower fields. Alchemical classics state: "This is called the Spirit-Qi Cavern, within which lies the essence of Kan and Li." Thus, essence, qi, and spirit all converge here.

Lush and verdant, the Valley of Empty Spirit—thickly luxuriant, it blankets the empty spirit, preserving the complexion. This is the true qi of the Firm Jade Lord and the Imperial Prosperity August One, descending to infuse the spleen and stomach, flourishing like a clump of verdant growth, thereby moistening and enhancing the countenance.

The Bright Wheel Child of the Azure Liver—the Four Perfected of the Liver, Azure Bright Lord, styled Bright Wheel Child, receives stomach qi to render the eyes luminous. The liver pertains to Wood, Wood’s color is azure, hence "azure liver." The Bright Wheel refers to the sun and moon: in the heavens, sun and moon are flying essences; in the grottoes, they are hidden roots; among humans, they are bright wheels. Those who ingest the bright wheel become immortals. Methods exist for absorbing the radiance of sun and moon, which can moisten the five viscera and enhance the complexion. Wood governs the eastern region of Jia and Yi, the gate through which sun and moon emerge. The earthly realm, at dawn and dusk, greets and sends off the spirits of Yu-Yi and Jie-Lin.

Luminous and clear, penetrating the eight windows—the sun and moon emerge, and their brilliance must illuminate. How much more so the eight windows, exquisitely wrought—how could they not be radiant? One version reads "eight faculties," which is surely an error. This refers to the Eight Scenic Illuminations of the Mud-Pellet Nine, their resplendent splendor suffusing the threefold Yellow Path.

The Taiyi’s companion, Qiu Lan—Qiu Lan is the name of the Great Woman in the Dipper, and also the name of the spirit of the lower stomach duct. These are metaphors, like a monk asked about the meaning of the Western advent, who replied, "The cypress tree before the courtyard," or "The grass before Master Lianxi’s window," which are no different from one’s own intent.

Bearing talismans, entering the Jade Palace—obeying the command of Taiyi, they hold talismans and staffs, ascending into the Jade Emperor’s Palace behind the brain. There, they present the merits and transgressions of mortals. On the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month, the days of Geng-Shen and Jia-Zi, and one’s own life-destiny day, they report on the deeds of human souls.

The absolution of seven generations’ sins—delivering the souls of seven ancestral lines, pardoning transgressions and faults. For the hun-souls gather in the Mud-Pill Palace, presenting the good and evil deeds of mortals. First, the seven generations of forebears are liberated; if one lacks good causes, the burden extends to ancestors and fathers, who must bear the punishment.

The Return-to-Origin awaits the Tenfold Permeation. As the *Scripture of Salvation* states: "Ten returns deliver humanity." Ten is also the completion number of earth. "Return-to-Origin" means reverting to the root and restoring the primordial. After ten full cycles, the lingering souls and stagnant po of seven ancestors and ninefold kin may be delivered.

Merging into the Chamber of the Imperial Unity—the revolving wind merges into the chamber of the Imperial Unity. The Chamber of the Imperial Unity lies within the Mysterious Pass. Some say the *Scripture of the Great Cavern* has no fixed sequence, with interwoven references that defy easy tracing. This scripture takes "revolving wind merging" as its theme, hence its shifting structure—front and back, above and below, left and right—interchanging. In truth, this arises from the dazzling interplay of pearl-like radiance, forming its text, which cannot be judged by a single standard.

In former times, Deng Yuzhi, styled Yanda, secluded himself in the Grotto-Spirit Terrace to cultivate the Way of Merging with the Imperial Unity. Each night, he recited the *Scripture of the Great Cavern*. Once, he was visited by the descent of Lady Wei, who told him: "You possess a destiny for immortality, and your tireless recitation has brought me here." One day, three azure birds suddenly arrived, dancing and singing like cranes, lingering for a time before departing. Yuzhi said to his disciples: "The azure birds have come—court assembly is near." He then transcended in a wondrous transformation, becoming an immortal. Was this not a sign of the Imperial Unity?

The Five Elders transform into childlike innocence. The Five Elders, as previously noted, now through the cultivation of the *Great Cavern*’s revolving wind merging Way, all revert to ignorance, becoming unknowing, infantile youths. The Five Elders are the Five Phases; hence, they are called "elders." They are the spirits of the five viscera.

The inception of the Grand Simplicity’s Brahman conduct—when qi, form, and substance are complete yet never separate, it is called the Grand Simplicity. At the initial stage of advancing Brahman conduct, when the fire-timing is insufficient and the golden elixir unformed, the wondrous fruit of Brahman conduct has only reached the fourth level. One must remain reverent and diligent, advancing without slack.

One goodness permeates the Fourfold Gold. "One" is water, which beneficially nurtures all things. As the saying goes: "When the Five Phases do not follow their sequence, the tiger is born in water." The Way of the elixir follows the generative numbers of heaven and earth. Earth’s four generates metal, called the Grand Simplicity. Water generates metal; the child hides in the mother’s womb. Metal is the nature of spirit, residing in the upper cinnabar field, known as the crown gate. People call it the "gate of nature." Nature is most numinous; thus, before the gate of nature closes, one still knows past lives. Once it closes, such knowledge is lost. It lodges in the heart, responding to all affairs. If one can comprehend the gate of nature, one may cultivate the wondrous conduct of the Grand Simplicity’s contemplative gate, transforming into a golden immortal.

---

The above jade verse in celestial script, eighty characters in all, governs above the Boundless Vow-Heaven of Unfathomable Oaths and commands below the Sixth-Tiered Earth Virtue Lord.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: "The contemplative gate of the Grand Simplicity’s Fourfold Brahman conduct first permeates the singular goodness. Essence-water moistens and revives; withered and decayed, it sprouts anew. This is called 'essence-harmony.' When essence harmonizes, spirit harmonizes; when spirit harmonizes, qi clarifies. Clarified qi then harmonizes—hence, 'clarity and harmony.'"

Fourfold completion perfects the Fourfold Gold. The earth number’s five hundred merit-points thus enable the Grand Unity to manifest a divine body before the White Emperor, attending the primordial po. The Western Dipper records names in the *Jade Numinous Jade Chapters*.

The Primordial Heavenly King said: "The twenty-fifth jade verse of the *Great Cavern*’s Wenchang: Heaven’s five generates earth; the Five Spirits’ wondrous conduct."

*Guihai*, *Weiji*, *Qian*.

The Supreme Ultimate presides over the Fourfold True—
The Fourfold True are the Grand Simplicity, Grand Origin, Grand Beginning, and Grand Substance. The Supreme Ultimate presides because only here do the Five Ultimates finally separate, each possessing its own body. As the saying goes: "Each thing has its own Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images"—the Four Images are the Fourfold True. There is also the August Ultimate, governing ruler, minister, people, and things; the qi-movement governing years, months, days, and hours; the numbers governing kalpas, epochs, and generations. Heaven, earth, and humanity all arise therefrom. In heaven, there are the Supreme Ultimate True Person, Supreme Ultimate Immortal Elder, and Supreme Ultimate Immortal Official, who oversee the immortal registers. Xu Laile, Huo Shanyuan Fu, Xiliangzi Wang Zongzhen, An Duming, and Haojing Shechong are all titled Supreme Ultimate True Persons. The Four True Persons in the *Jade Emperor Scripture* and the Fourfold True in the Buddhist *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* are essentially the same. In humanity, they are the heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys—the Fourfold True.

Soaring on feathers, roaming the Upper Clarity—
"Feathers soaring" means swiftly donning feathered robes to roam the heavens of Upper Clarity. An ancient poem says: "The knife’s measure enters the belly, sprouting feathered wings." One who consumes yellow essence and abstains from the five grains will grow fur and feathers, able to fly through empty space and walk the void.

Seven revolutions summon the Director of Destinies—
"Seven revolutions" are the seven returns and nine reversions. At this stage in the elixir Way, the fire-timing is complete, and one may summon the Director of Destinies within the heart, journeying together to Upper Clarity. Upper Clarity is the Crimson Palace of the heart, where all spirits pay court.

The Grand Unity displays its radiant might—
The Grand Unity resides in the head, manifesting its majestic power. In humanity, it fiercely combats worldly toils, preventing sleep-demons and yin-evil from encroaching. Drowsiness scatters spirit and vitality, allowing demons to bully. Thus, martial readiness is employed to restrain and adorn it.

The Recorder safeguards the stored destiny—
The *Scripture of Salvation* speaks of the Director of Destinies, Director of Officials, Extender of Lifespan, Increaser of Years, and Deliverer from Misfortune as honored spirits, all sharing this meaning. The Director of Officials governs the principle of endless generation, thus safeguarding the stored destiny as the great root and foundation.

Threefold elevation ascends the numinous thunder—
Once the Supreme Ultimate divides, heaven and earth are established. The Eastern King and Western Mother are set as the parents of all things. Now, the Recorder Spirit thrice elevates the eldest son to preside over the thunder vessel, ensuring the lineage does not falter. Thus, the Way of establishing heaven and earth is no different from the Way of the August Ultimate. Those who recite this invoke it to celebrate the Eastern August One’s millennial reign.

The Demon Kings come to receive their duties—
Those who attain the Dao cannot transcend the Three Realms without the Demon Kings’ sponsorship. Once they have crossed beyond the Three Realms, they receive the Jade Emperor’s decree to oversee the mechanisms of governance. Thus, the great demons who once obstructed them must now come forward to bow and receive their commissions.

The Immortal Officials restrain the ghostly essences—
As the *Book of Changes* states: “Essence and qi become things.” When essence and qi gather, life is born; when the wandering soul transforms, the hun ascends and the po descends, and death ensues. Once dead, they become ghosts. Confucius said: “Radiant brightness, mournful vapors—these are the essences of the hundred things.” In Fengdu, the Six Cavern Palaces’ Immortal Officials, though they govern demons and ghosts, also hold immortal offices, subordinate to the celestial bureaus. Thus, the Immortal Officials bind the ghostly essences for the practitioner, preventing them from returning to the Way and corrupting virtue. This act of yang restraining yin dissolves the passions and perfects the nature, allowing ascent through the Three Realms to realize true immortality.

The Azure Emperor’s Mother resides in the moon—
Some say “in the sun,” but this is incorrect. The Azure Emperor is yang; the Mother is yin within yang, the hidden yin within the Li Palace’s womb. Later, it speaks of the Moon Mother Ning Sulan, sharing the same meaning: sun as yang, moon as yin, their union generating the myriad things. She is called the Fragrant and Resplendent Infant, the name of the moon’s hun-soul, the goddess of the Feminine One. The Daoist scriptures say: “Within the moon dwells Lord Taokang, resplendent in the Yellow Chamber,” and “The moon’s palace brims with immortal recipes”—all referring to the same principle. Heaven and earth, through the union of yin and yang, fulfill the principle of generation and transformation.

The Supreme Unfolds the Five Talismans—
The Central Primordial Lord of the Yellow Plain, Yuan Hua Huang Ren, bears the style “Supreme Unfolds Above.” He presents the Five Numinous Talismans to pacify and stabilize heaven and earth, just as humans use the five qi to stabilize the five viscera. This chapter corresponds to earth, governing the Four Symbols, hence the term “Five Talismans.”

Peace Comes to Bear the Jade Name—
The Left Primordial Lord of the Purple Plain, Yi Yu Ren, bears the style “Peace Comes Above.” His is the Jade Name—indeed, a name of jade. One version reads “Peace Comes to Life,” a grave error. The Three Primordial Lords’ jade taboos are: White Plain for the Right Primordial Lord, and for the Left Primordial Lord, Qiming Xiao Ren, styled “Golden Gate Above.”

The Chamber of Harmonious Transformation pervades the Six Directions—
“Harmonious Transformation” is one of the Nine Hun-souls’ names. Only by blending and transforming within the Six Directions—what the *Universal Geography* calls the Six Directions and Eight Extremities—can this be achieved. In humans, it is the brain palace, the Mud Pill, where the myriad spirits gather.

The Cavern Palace arrays the Fire Soldiers—
The Cavern Palace is the Crimson Palace. The *Jade Scripture* states: “The Vermilion Emperor of the Red Mound, the Red Rider of the Divine Immortals, the Red Lads of the Demon-Slaying Register, command the Fire Soldiers.” The incantation says: “The Luminous Divine Youth commands the Fire Soldiers. The Jade Controller of the Southern Thearch governs the Terrace of Vermilion Yang, dispatching the fire essence and the Red Soldiers of Bing, wielding the authority of the Supreme Perfected. They employ the spirits of Bing and Ding to enact celestial virtue, and the spirits of Si and Wu to rectify earthly qi.” In truth, this is the fire of the heart. Used rightly, it refines the Golden Crucible’s great elixir; used wrongly, it ignites the fires of ignorance, plunging one into the dark hells.

The Five Numinous Forces surge through the Supreme Ultimate—
When the Five Phases are complete, they harmonize; when incomplete, they clash. Before the Supreme Ultimate divided, the Five Phases were undifferentiated within it. After its division, the Four Symbols each assumed their positions, while the Supreme Ultimate, belonging to earth, resided at the center. Thus, it lends form to the Four Symbols and entrusts its vigor to the four seasons. Now, with the Five Numinous Forces of the Supreme Ultimate in harmonious union, no conflict arises. The Five Numinous Forces are the Five Phases—water, fire, wood, metal, and earth—the Five Elders, the Five Thearchs, the Five Marchmounts. In humans, they are the five viscera. When harmonized, the five qi surge purely, the five flowers naturally bloom, the five bodies thrive in health, and one becomes a true immortal.

The Imperial Son Bin receives the Horizontal Script—
The Imperial Son Bin appears in the previous scroll, where it says: “The Imperial Son Bin presents the Five Talismans,” and “The True Yang Elder, the Imperial Son Bin.” This spirit, residing above the five viscera in humans, can enter the Jade Emperor’s Palace behind the brain to report one’s sins and blessings. The “Horizontal Script” refers to the Five Scripts, which are the Five Phases of the Supreme Ultimate—the fifteen numbers of the Luo and Yellow River diagrams, arranged horizontally and vertically. This is the Hun-soul of the August One, ascending to become the “Imperial Son,” one of the myriad spirits. In heaven, he is the Imperial Son and Guest; in humans, the guest of the heart. He rectifies deviant qi, descends the flow of true qi, and nourishes the myriad spirits, his patterns both horizontal and vertical following principle.

The above is the Jade Stanza of Heavenly Seal Script, eighty characters in all, which above stabilizes the Vast Court of the Azure Empyrean and the Heaven of Rosy Clouds, and below governs the Seventh Tier’s Water-Restraining Marshland and the Earthly Sovereign of the Yellow Soil.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: “In the wondrous practice of contemplating the spirits through the Five Numinous Forces of the Supreme Ultimate, first cultivate the Four Virtues. The Five Numbers reside at the center, corresponding to the spleen-earth and the root of intention. Thus, it is called ‘contemplating the spirits.’ The heart’s palace is the seat of thought; reflection arises from the root of intention—this is the wondrous practice of Dark Purity and Profound Wisdom. Therefore, the Five Degrees of Heaven and the Five Horizontal Scripts are indeed the ‘Script’ that unites the Five Directions, totaling ten. When one hears goodness, the Mysterious Above pierces the glabella, and the Six Dings illuminate with cavernous light—this corresponds to the previous scroll’s ‘piercing the glabella with the ten directions,’ the wondrous practice of the ear root’s cavernous subtlety. When one sees goodness, the Cinnabar Origin’s square pupils and the Eight Scribes radiate cavernous clarity—this corresponds to the previous scroll’s ‘Luminous Pearl,’ the square pupils being the wondrous practice of the eye root’s cavernous vision. When one speaks goodness, the Tongming swallows and rinses, the Five Scripts and Jade Flowers—this corresponds to the previous scroll’s ‘tasting and refining the Five Sprouts Pearl,’ the wondrous practice of the tongue root’s cavernous subtlety. When one walks goodness, strength aids and connects, the Earthly Pass and Life Gate—wielding the spirit and life root of the Heavenly and Earthly Passes, the hands and feet’s strength connects through the wondrous practice of cavernous numinosity. When the original nature first unites with the Five Degrees, it perfects the Five Horizontal Scripts. From the Five Greatnesses of Heaven and the Five Hundred Merits, it completes the Central Qi’s Numinous Imperial Lord. Thereby, the Primordial Life-Form coalesces, the Yellow Emperor of the Center presides, the myriad spirits guard and encamp, and the Great Dipper’s Chief Star oversees the host of spirits.”

Here ends Scroll Eight of the *Jade Purity’s Boundless Supreme Perfected Writ of the Great Cavern and the Numinous Star of Literature*.

(Note: “Wang Wen” should likely read “Yu Wen.”)

● "Wang" should likely read "Yu."
● "Thus it is called Lao" should likely read "Some call it the Five Elders."

**Scroll Nine of the *Jade Purity’s Boundless Supreme Perfected Writ of the Great Cavern and the Numinous Star of Literature***

The Primordial Heavenly King states: The twenty-sixth jade chapter of the *Great Cavern of Wenchang* speaks of Earth’s sixfold completion into water, and the wondrous practice of the six harmonies.

*Jiazi*, *Kun*, *Zhun*—
Heaven and Earth bear no branches or stems.

Within the Dipper dwell the Four Perfected,
scattering flowers upon the Jade Purity Terrace.
The Northern Dipper’s position lies in the Kan Palace,
and Kan is water. The Four Perfected are the Four Symbols previously mentioned.
Formerly called the Upper Purity, now the Jade Purity—
a yet higher tier, corresponding in man to the brain palace.
The Four Perfected govern the Four Perfected Inscriptions within the Great Ultimate.

Burning incense and scattering flowers,
circling in the pacing of emptiness—
such is the joy of the true immortals,
the fragrance and blossoms arising from the true qi within the body.
One must not cling to images or attachments as though they were substantial things.
The Jade Purity Terrace is none other than the upper cinnabar field of the Muddy Pellet Palace within man.

The Imperial Minister of the Central Mystery is born—
the Upper Primordial Imperial Minister of the Muddy Pellet Palace,
whose name is Zhong Xuansheng,
encompasses the host of immortals.
(One version reads "Imperial Homeland’s Zhong Xuanli," which is erroneous.
Another states: "The Three-One Imperial Minister, whose refined essence is named Zhong Xuansheng,
is also called the Second Unity of the One Spirit Perfected.")

At the first advent of Zhong Xuansheng,
the host of perfected beings gathers in full.
Where the mind directs, qi rushes to follow—
not out of reluctance, but because intent commands qi,
and qi obeys its bidding.
When one true being assembles, ten thousand true beings assemble.

Fragrant winds fan the Three Treasures—
gentle breezes waft and stir above the Three Treasures,
serving as offerings.
The Three Treasures are the three treasures within one’s body.
Through refined cultivation and inner alchemy,
the five qi steam forth,
and fragrant winds emanate externally.
This aligns with the *Mysterious Contract*, which states:
"Always offer celestial incense and celestial flowers to the Primordial Beginning."
The *Celestial Youth Sutra* says:
"Golden rice and jade nectar arise from seeking within—
all are found within one’s own body.
Do not seek outwardly."
The Three Treasures are the spirits of the three fields;
the fragrant winds are the steaming of true qi.
The fan symbolizes diligent stirring—
all follow the natural way.

The five viscera reflect the Clear and Level Palace.
The preceding passages speak of celestial matters,
while this line turns to the affairs within the body.
Thus, one draws near from the self and far from things.
This speaks of the Clear and Level Palace in heaven,
which man mirrors with the qi of the five viscera.
Buddhist texts say:
"Offer the fivefold fragrant incense as devotion,
and vow to uphold this resolve in repayment of the Buddha’s grace."
The *Book of Documents* states:
"Millet and sorghum are not truly fragrant—
only bright virtue is fragrant."
All share this principle.
People often burn incense, arrange flowers,
and prepare a hundred delicacies as offerings,
believing they accumulate merit.
Yet if sincerity is lacking,
heaven and earth do not accept it.
Instead, they incur the fault of wastefulness and the transgression of irreverence.
How much better to refine the fivefold true incense within oneself,
offering it to the Three Treasures within the body!
Then the five viscera will naturally radiate clarity,
peace, and harmony—
free from harm by ghosts and spirits,
and blessed with abundant fortune.
Why, then, do people toil in vain, seeking outwardly?

The azure barbarian’s radiant splendor—
only with qi does sound arise.
Sound harmonizes in high and low tones,
forming musical harmony.
When the numinous wind stirs and circulates,
it becomes music—
this single point of numinous light,
unobstructed and luminous,
shines throughout the eight directions.
In man, it is the golden elixir,
accumulated within,
while speech and sound manifest externally.
Thus, the six qi are distinct,
and the six yin demons are subdued.
The *Scripture of Salvation* speaks of the millet-grain pearl,
and the Buddha’s Śākyamuni jewel—
in truth, they are one.
The Great Elixir is called the Dragon-Tiger Great Medicine,
which must be conjoined with true lead and true mercury
to achieve resplendent radiance.

The sandalwood blazes with auspicious harmony—
harmonious qi brings forth blessings.
The sounds uttered by the Primordial Beginning
are called the "Sandalwood Blazing Harmony."
The *Scripture of the Jade Emperor* says:
"The wondrous music of the Celestial Harmony."
When Duke Mu of Qin reached the Heavenly Gate,
he heard the vast music of the Celestial Harmony.
When Emperor Ming of Tang arrived at the Moon Palace,
he heard the *Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Robe* melody—
both were celestial music.
In the mortal world, there are the Yellow Emperor’s *Xianchi*,
Yao’s *Great Elegance*,
Shun’s *Nine Shao*,
Yu’s *Great Xia*,
and Tang’s *Great Huo*—
all are the music of a well-governed age.
Where music reaches, auspiciousness gathers—
the height of harmony.
"Husband and wife live in harmony, like the zither and lute;
brothers unite in joy and delight."
How much more so with celestial music—
would it not bring forth auspicious signs?
Thus, when music harmonizes, spirits harmonize;
when spirits harmonize, heaven and earth harmonize;
when heaven and earth harmonize,
the five grains flourish,
and the people live in peace.
How could the vulgar music of Zheng and Wei ever achieve this?
When the five viscera within man are at peace,
speech becomes clear and resonant—
all who hear it perceive the pure Dharma-sound.

The Great Centrality’s six qi are pure—
beyond the Five Greatnesses lies another Five Greatnesses,
completing the number ten—
the number of the *River Chart*.
This is the one root from which the six qi divide.
In the Great Centrality, the five movements and six breaths are clear and undisturbed,
continuing the preceding theme of harmonious music.
The six qi correspond to Earth’s sixfold completion into water.
The six qi govern the generation and destruction of the myriad things in heaven and earth—
medical texts describe this in detail.
They also respond to human influence:
cold, heat, wind, rain, darkness, and obscurity are called the six atmospheric influences.
If one opposes their qi, illness and epidemics arise,
even leading to death.
Yet practicing the wondrous Way of the Great Cavern’s Great Centrality averts them.

The winding waters embrace the Celestial River—
as previously stated:
"One bend of the water hears the heavens."
The Celestial River flows into the Eastern Well,
circulating between heaven and earth.
The ancients said:
"The waters issue from Kunlun,
flow downward through the tail’s gate,
then rise again—
this is the Celestial River,
the river of heaven and earth."

The human river flows upward from the Tail Gate to Kunlun,
harmonizing with heaven and earth.
The Yellow River’s nine bends mirror the nine coils of the human intestines—
Master Lü said:
*"Above the winding river, the moon’s radiance gleams pure,
a bird takes flight."*
This aligns with *"One bend of the water hears the heavens,"*
both found beneath the preceding *Great Primordial* chapter,
their purport mutually illuminating.

The six perfections’ merit is complete—
the six perfections and ten thousand practices’ merit now perfected,
corresponding to the six waters.
Six perfections, six yin, six unions—
all are numerical completions.
When a person’s cultivation reaches fulfillment,
three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds
may also ascend as an Upper Immortal.

The five demons assail the six yin.
The five demons are:
Green Heaven’s Demon King, Bayuan Choubo;
Red Heaven’s Demon King, Futiandan Shi;
White Heaven’s Demon King, Fanshan Liumu;
Black Heaven’s Demon King, Jianchou Langyu;
Yellow Heaven’s Demon King, Hengtian Danli.
At the center coalesces the Primordial Beginning Lord—
the four cardinals and four corners all become the realm of the Great Yang Dao,
only then does the Primordial Beginning manifest.
As with one who refines away all yin qi,
forging pure yang,
only then does the Great Cavern’s Imperial Honored One appear—
the *Chapter of Spirit Generation* states:
*"Loftily coalesces the Primordial Beginning Lord,"*
of the same meaning.

Loftily behold the sixfold union’s court.
Having coalesced the Primordial Beginning within,
one may gaze upward to perceive all within the six unions—
just as the human spirit may inwardly inspect the viscera.
Master Zhang the Celestial Master cultivated for a thousand days,
able to inwardly inspect the five viscera
and outwardly gather the ten thousand spirits and their kind.

The wondrous practice of the Great Centrality takes qi as its master.
There is the qi of heaven and earth,
and the qi of father and mother,
which mingle to generate a person.
Within the womb, the umbilical cord connects to the mother—
when she exhales, so does the child;
when she inhales, so does the child.
At birth, the umbilical cord is severed,
and each breathes independently.
Qi is stored in the Sea of Qi,
called the life’s origin—
those who cultivate life cultivate this.

The above jade chapter of celestial seal-script comprises seventy characters,
above it governs the Abyssal-Pervading Primordial Cavern Heaven,
below it commands the Seventh Fortress’s Virtue Lord.

The *Mysterious Contract* states:
*"The wondrous observation gate of the Great Centrality’s six unions—
contemplate goodness, practice goodness,
unobstructed and unimpeded,
supreme goodness untransgressed,
abide in goodness, preserve peace,
establish goodness as the foundation,
perfect the ten virtues,
the ten flowers interpenetrate in glory.
Life unites with wisdom,
the winding waters embrace the flow,
the six perfections’ merit is complete.
A thousand merits accomplished,
from the first to the sixth,
three thousand six hundred,
fulfill the great merit,
thereby the Nine Heavens bear you as a Perfected Person,
the Five Emperors for you vanquish the six yin.
Revolving the Dipper, traversing the Winnowing Basket,
you cross the Celestial Pass—
the eight luminaries darkly merge,
and the Mysterious of the Mysterious begins."*

The Primordial Beginning Heavenly King said:
*"The twenty-seventh jade chapter of the Great Cavern’s Wenchang—
heaven’s seven completes fire,
the seven awakening wondrous practices.
Yichou, Bingyin, Meng, Xu.
Within Chen resides the Yellow Radiance qi."*

At *Chen*—the sun—within the sun’s heart dwells the qi of yellow radiance, speaking of the newly risen sun. It figures the hour of the Golden Elixir when the yang qi of the Yellow Court first stirs, and thus the moment of action: when lead meets *gui*, it must be swiftly gathered.

Three blossoms ascend the Empyrean Court.
Three leaps, and only then do they mount the Milky Way, rolling upward on the round axle to the layered heavens—how arduous! The Three Blossoms are a mountain in the midst of heaven; immortals call the magic mushroom the “three-blossom herb.” Riding the qi of yellow radiance, they wander the court of the Great Empyrean.

The Azure Terrace wheels its feathered chariot.
In the Eastern Sea’s Penglai stands a mountain named Canglang, and a terrace also called Canglang. Realized immortals, borne by the qi of yellow radiance, drive feathered chariots in flight to this terrace, enter the Three-Blossom Mountain, return to the Empyrean Court Palace, and there assume office and duty.

The Way of Welcoming and Prolonging is already accomplished.
Perfected immortals and Primordial *Chen* Perfected Ones, wearing the talismans of Welcoming and Prolonging, ride the whirlwind wheels and feathered chariots as carefree immortals—this is the achievement of cultivating the *Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture*, not the rank of lesser immortals.

The Director of Destinies bears the Emperor’s writ.
The spirit who governs the heart receives the imperial decree and proclaims it to the ten directions, ever mindful of preserving the root of life. The Director of Destinies, in golden script, determines the span of human life; all depends on whether the heart is stored and well used, for only then can one be called one who bears the marks of longevity.

He is titled Minister of the Mysterious Measure.
The Central Director of Destinies, the Venerable One who governs the dawn of clarity, is titled Minister of the Mysterious Measure. His sole duty is to guard the Crimson Palace of the heart. Human life is originally a hundred years, but because of the varying degrees of good and evil, the gods and spirits oversee its granting and taking, so that few reach eighty or ninety.

Preserve life in the Palace of Great Radiance.
Preserve life and protect destiny in the Palace of Great Radiance—that is, the Crimson Palace. This chapter corresponds entirely to the number of fire. Humans embody the image of *li* brightness, belonging to fire, their brilliance shining like radiance; thus it is called the Palace of Great Radiance, preserving the root of life.

Array the guest lodges in the Upper Clarity.
The lodges for guests are arrayed in the Palace of Upper Clarity—also the Crimson Palace—for it is the gathering place of the ten thousand qi and the ten thousand spirits. The ancients said: when one aperture opens, all apertures open; when one spirit gathers, all spirits gather.

The Gate of Life conjoins essence and prolongs.
The Gate of Life is the right kidney; its spirit, named Taokang, conjoins essence and prolongs. In sevenfold vision it appears. One tradition says: on the left is Father Ningzai, on the right is Mother Jingyan; it is also called the name of the Great Cavern’s Imperial Unity, Supreme Spirit Lord—both are preserved.

Guard my body’s Yellow Tranquility.
Taokang constantly gazes upward to Yellow Tranquility to receive qi. For the spleen and stomach, having received the water and grain, disperse them to the five viscera and six bowels. Earlier, Yellow Tranquility was noted as having a commentary; it is also the jade taboo of the Three Perfected of essence and blood—these may be cross-referenced.

On the left, escort the Lord of Primordial Simplicity.
“Primordial Simplicity” is another name for Wuying, as previously annotated. He is the master of the Fire Marsh, that is, the Left Primordial Lord of Purple Simplicity, Yiyuren, whose name is Anlaishang. He governs the protection of the liver and the guarding of the hun-soul, corresponding above to the virtue of wood and the Year Star, and below to Mount Tai of the Eastern Marchmount.

On the right, grasp the Vermilion Luxuriance.
The White Primordial Lord who Regulates Yang, named Zhu Jing, whose name is Yulingbiao—also called Xuan Yijuezhong—is the master of the Water Pool. As noted in the previous volume in the annotation on Master Zhu Jing Qiming, he communicates with the qi of the lungs and below presides over Mount Hua of the Western Marchmount.

Great Harmony conveys the Seven Awakenings.
Seven is the completion number of fire, hence the resonance in meaning. The Seven Awakenings are the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper in heaven and the seven apertures of the heart in humans. When the qi of Great Harmony enters, awareness and perception arise, and the literary brilliance shines forth—hence the following phrase speaks of the true scripture proclaiming humanity. If one can bring centered harmony to the body, then “my body’s heaven and earth are positioned, and the ten thousand things nurtured”; thus, the heaven and earth outside the body are also positioned, and the ten thousand things nurtured. To be ever in perfect enlightenment yet never in perfect enlightenment is the way of the ordinary person. The immortals say: “Why not consume the qi of Great Harmony’s essence?” Mount Wudang calls it the Mountain of Great Harmony. In Buddhism, the Seven Awakenings are, in sequence: mindfulness, discernment of dharmas, diligence, joy, ease, concentration, and equanimity—these are also called the Seven Awakenings. In essence, they are nothing other than the spirit of pre-heaven and pre-earth, the numinous clarity that does not darken—it is simply the one empty, numinous awareness. Master Guifeng Pei’s exposition is most detailed.

Igniting the fire gives rise to the True Writs. Two dots form fire; earth’s two generates fire, heaven’s seven completes it, coalescing into the Vermilion Numinous Fire Mansion’s True Writs of the Southern Elixir—this is what was earlier called the Cloud Scripts of the Five Directions, the crucible’s flowing fire courtyard, where cavernous yang qi glows crimson, hence named the Crimson Writs. The Purple Radiance guides the Embryonic Immortals: only after the jade pupils refine the substance, the Yellow Radiance purges the form, and the Purple Radiance True Person leads the Embryonic Immortals to verify and ascend to immortal fruition—yet it is only through the refinement of Nanchang’s alchemical transformation that one may be reborn in heaven and regenerated in the world, exchanging mortal for immortal. This speaks of the Ten Radiant Immortals.

The Spirit within the Primal Mandate’s Truth: this is the Embryonic Immortal, also called the Primal Mandate True Person. The *Tradition* states: “At fifty, one knows Heaven’s mandate.” Yet if so, Heaven itself would never attain the Dao. The Primal Mandate is the primordial reception of Heaven’s luminous decree; within the truth resides the Spirit of Eternal Life, the Great Lord—this is the spirit enduring through vast kalpas, existing alone before heaven and earth, uncorrupted through eons, perfectly luminous and serenely void, wondrously existent yet truly empty. Such is its essence. Swift without haste, arriving without movement, transforming myriadfold, responding to affairs and engaging with beings—such is its function. Only by nurturing it with harmonious qi does one achieve the wondrous practice of the Seven Awakenings.

The above jade passage of celestial script comprises eighty characters, above governing the exalted literary grace of the wondrously perfected heavens, below presiding over the Virtuous Lords of the Seventh Stratum.

The *Mysterious Concordance* states: “The Tenfold Radiance’s Gate of Contemplation in the Purple Radiance Heaven of the Great Harmony’s Seven Awakenings wondrous practice—
First, the essence pervades the Cinnabar Radiance Earth of Supreme Nonbeing;
Second, the qi pervades the Azure Radiance Heaven of Congealed Mystery;
Third, the spirit pervades the Plain Radiance Earth of Myriad Beings;
Fourth, the purity pervades the Yellow Radiance Heaven of the Ten Directions;
Fifth, the origin pervades the Jade Radiance Earth of Supreme Clarity;
Sixth, the origin pervades the Golden Radiance Heaven of Dark Yin;
Seventh, the origin pervades the Verdant Radiance Earth of Supreme Mystery;
Eighth, the primordial pervades the Jasper Radiance Heaven of Highest Clarity;
Ninth, the primordial pervades the Jade Void’s Luminous Radiance Earth;
Tenth, the mysterious pervades the Jade Clarity’s Chaotic Abyss ●.”

The Tenfold Supreme Nonbeing’s Radiance connects the empty earth dwelling within heaven, a thousand practices commencing. At the first ignition, the Crimson Chaotic Wisdom coalesces with the Primordial Truth—hearing merges with union, seeing merges with union, union with virtue transforms the form—this is called the Supreme August within the Mysterious, the Spirit within the Truth.

The Primordial Heavenly King states: “The twenty-eighth jade passage of the Great Cavern’s Literary Florescence: earth’s eight completes wood, the wondrous practice of the Eight Sceneries.” Dingmao, Wuchen, litigation, and armies. The qi of the Golden Watchtower’s Upper Scenery...

The Golden Watchtower is the palace where the Three Pures preside—one text calls it the Golden Watchtower, which must be an error. The *fan*, *qing*, and *jing* Three Qi are the wondrous qi of the Qingwei Heaven. This scripture, when summoning the Primordial Spirit, the Mountain Perfected, and the Three Officials, first takes the *jing* qi as its foundation.

The Ten Directions glow with purple mist.
This speaks of the *jing* qi suffusing all, the Ten Directions radiant and coalescing into purple-hued clouds of mist. The *Huangting* states: “Purple mist above and below, the Three Pristine Clouds.”

The Three Conjoin the Supreme Unity.
The Supreme Unity, according to the *Records of the Grand Historian*, resides in the Purple Tenuity’s Imperial Throne—see the earlier volume’s annotation on the Supreme Unity as the root of destiny. The Three Conjoining refers to the *xuan*, *yuan*, and *shi* Three Qi uniting in virtue, synonymous with the aforementioned *fan*, *qing*, and *jing* Three Qi.

The Emperor summons the Supreme Primordial Spirit.
The Supreme Primordial Spirit is the name of the essence-soul of the Northern Direction. The Jade Emperor regularly summons it with the True Summoning Talisman to inquire into and examine the matters of merit and transgression under the jurisdiction of the Three Palaces and Five Peaks—this is the indestructible Primordial Spirit of a person through kalpas.

Seven revolutions summon the Mountain Perfected.
The Five Peaks have Five Perfected Persons, Five Perfected Lords, and Five Sage Emperors, with subordinate offices overseeing the registers of life and death. The Seven Revolutions refer to the talisman’s swaying and drawing during the summoning, revolving to the number seven, for seven is the number of generation.

The Jade Talisman notifies the Three Officials.
The Supreme Unity’s honored spirit notifies the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water with the Jade Talisman. A person’s Primordial Spirit congeals, the Five Qi circulating through the Three Officials to gather at the crown and pay homage to the Primordial. Those who cultivate the Great Cavern’s Dao should remove their names from the Three Officials’ registers.

Extract the registers from the Three Paths below.
Command the Three Officials and Five Peaks to erase the names of the guilty from the registers of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, pardoning and releasing them. The Three Paths and Five Sufferings together form the Eight Difficulties. Only when one departs from the Eight Difficulties may there be signs of rebirth.

Receive birth in the Lofty Supreme Constellation.
Those who cultivate the *Wenchang Great Cavern*’s Dao, transcending the Five Phases and Eight Trigrams, refine the lead and mercury within the body into the Elixir—when merit and practice are complete, the True Spirit naturally surpasses the Three Realms, receiving birth in the Lofty Supreme Constellation’s ultimate pole.

The Supreme Emperor of the Eight Spirits,
The Supreme Emperor is the essence-soul named Yangtang, styled Baling—“King” denotes reverence. The *Shengshen* states: “The Supreme Emperor is titled Yangtang, styled Baling Lord,” also called the Spirit of the Eight Consciousnesses. The Eight Spirits and Eight Sceneries are the completion numbers of wood.

One transformation returns the Auspicious Clouds.
From this single transformation, the Auspicious Clouds are drawn back to open the Gate of Life. The Elixir Canon states: “The double passes of the spine reach the crown gate—this is the root of the cultivation path.” The fire-timing of the Golden Elixir lies in personal inquiry; it cannot be conjectured.

Peach Health guards the Six Harmonies.
See the middle volume’s annotation on entering the essence of the Six Harmony Chambers. Peach Lord is the name of the kidney spirit. One should curb anger, restrain desire, cherish essence, and treasure qi, making them the master of the body and the root of life and destiny. When thoughts of lust arise, visualize Peach Health in the navel.

Restrain essence to fortify the Mud Pill.
Restraining essence follows a natural principle. If one employs the arts of the bedchamber, it is like cooking sand to make rice—though steamed for a thousand kalpas, it remains only hot sand, never rice. The *Huangting* states: “The brain spirit’s essence-root is the Mud Pill’s root.” The Former Master said: “This essence is not the essence of lust but the Primordial Supreme Essence, the Jade Emperor’s saliva. In seeking a master and inquiring into the Dao, one must fathom its mysteries. Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without a master’s transmission, do not rashly guess. The Three-One Imperial Ministers first restrain essence—one should visualize this spirit directing true qi into the brain’s Mud Pill and Six Harmonies.”

Observe the Eight Sceneries of the Grand Clarity.
The wondrous practice of the Observation Gate is all read in the falling tone. The internal observation of the Three Fields and Eight Sceneries refers to the Grand Clarity’s Lower Field. The *Scripture of Ascending to Heaven* states: “Draw the True Qi of Grand Harmony and focus the mind’s intent on the Three Fields and Eight Sceneries of the Elixir Field—this lies in a single gaze of the heart and eyes.”

Proclaim the True Writ of Ten Virtues.
The sages looked up and down to draw the Eight Trigrams, thereby communicating with the virtue of the numinous. The Primordial began to expound the Great Cavern’s True Writ to congeal the True Spirit, forming the virtue of humanity—its principle is one. Virtue is what humanity is endowed with, what resides within the nature. Expressed, it becomes the Four Beginnings; concealed, it becomes the Five Constants—this is what is called “illuminating virtue” and “employing virtue.”

Nature is the Dao’s substance; virtue is the Dao’s function. Thus, it is said: “the virtue of nature,” harmonizing the inner and outer Dao. When one possesses pure and complete virtue, there is no excess or deficiency—this is the utmost impartiality and appropriateness of Heavenly Principle.

Preserve the Child, the Spirit within the Spirit.
The *Scripture of Salvation* states: “Within the true is the spirit.” This instructs the adept to cherish this body as one would a newborn child. Turning the light inward and reflecting, gazing within the heart and eyes, in stillness and stability over time, one naturally sees the spirit within the true, merging with it as one body.

The Primordial Destiny generates the natural.
The previous two chapters state: “The Primordial Destiny generates the Grand Beginning.” When the Primordial Destiny Perfected Person first comes into being, it is naturally so, not through forced human effort. This is the Eight of Earth completing Wood in the Eastern Direction, signifying the Primordial of Destiny.

A person’s destiny is received from Heaven. One should preserve and guard it steadfastly, not allowing dissipation to endanger the Heavenly Mandate. Thus, the sage Confucius ate coarse food and drank water; the worthy Yanzi lived in a narrow alley with a bamboo bowl and gourd ladle. This is what it means to “find joy in the Heavenly Mandate” and “know the Heavenly Mandate and thus have no worries.” Even sages and worthies were thus—how much more should others be?

The above Jade Passage’s celestial seal comprises eighty characters. Above, it governs the Supreme Pristine’s Flourishing Music Forbidden Upper Heaven; below, it commands the Seventh Mound’s Virtuous Lord.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: “The wondrous practice of the Grand Clarity’s Eight Sceneries, the Ten Virtues permeating the form—employing virtue to harmonize with the body, advancing virtue on a level path, accomplishing virtue in vastness, the wisdom-virtue inwardly pure, the wisdom-virtue emitting light, the luminous virtue in perfect bloom, the numinous virtue universally responsive, the mysterious virtue in great square, the great virtue natural, the universal virtue aiding and embracing. When the Three Thousand Practices are complete, the True Writ descends and spreads. Wishes fulfilled, the true is accomplished—principle harmonizes with transformation, virtue harmonizes with the Dao. Preserve the Child, the myriad spirits illuminating the Eight Darknesses. Thereby, the Five Qi blend within, the hundred spirits unite.”

The Primordial Heavenly King states: The Twenty-Ninth Jade Chapter of the Grand Cavern, "Heavenly Nine Completes Gold, Nine Radiances’ Wondrous Practice." *Jisi*, *Gengwu*, *Bi*, *Xiaoxu*.

The Great Void is without scenery,
The Great Void, the vast emptiness—utterly devoid of things,
Without light, without form or image,
Silent, desolate—self and other both forgotten.

Moreover, the Lung Spirit is named Haohua Xucheng, corresponding to the Metal Quarter, for the Lord of Peng Chamber resides within the Great Void. Within the rosy clouds lies Peng Chamber. Amidst the iridescent mists, faintly appears the true abode of the spirit. Within the human body lies the Three Peng Chamber—the Three Corpse Spirits—who, on the days of *Gengshen*, *Jiazi*, and one’s own life-destiny, ascend to heaven to report one’s merits and transgressions. Another name is the Spirit Within.

Nine clouds seal the layered gates—
The nine clouds (in another version, the Nine Numinous) are the wondrous qi of the Nine Yangs, enclosing the gates. This signifies the nine orifices sealed, not a speck of dust entering—like the noble one who retreats into seclusion, gathering his treasures without fault, fasting to illumine his virtue with spirit.

The Lord Emperor abides in stillness and profound secrecy—
The Supreme One Emperor dwells in a place of tranquility and deep seclusion, situated above the human head. Without disturbance or disorder, it remains still. As *Laozi* says: "Attain utmost emptiness, preserve profound stillness—all things arise together." All depends on the work of stillness and concentration.

The Eight Perfected of the Radiant Lord—
The Eight Perfected of the Radiant Lord within the gallbladder commune with the Lung Spirit. Though Metal and Wood are separated, here they merge, and the Golden Elixir begins to form. This spirit’s name is Beitai Xuanjing. One should visualize the Azure-Clad Heavenly Worthy and guard the space within the gallbladder.

Above, she carries the Female Supreme One—
Lifting the Supreme One Immortal Maiden into the Muddy Pellet Palace, also called the Supreme One Primordial Lady—the Female One spirit, as previously noted. The Gallbladder Perfected and the Supreme One unite at the human’s Hundred Meetings point, also called the Gate of Myriad Wonders.

The Female and Male merge in the Jade Chamber—
The Female One, Male One, and Emperor One are called the Three Ones. Guarding them has its method, which one must seek within. The Female and Male are Yin and Yang; merging in the Jade Chamber refers to their union within the Cavern Chamber. As *Laozi* says: "Know the male, guard the female." Some may wonder how immortals could engage in such things, yet they fail to realize that Heaven as Father and Earth as Mother—Sun as Yang and Moon as Yin—unite to generate the myriad things. The *Book of Changes* pairs the Joyous Maiden with the Mountain Man in the hexagram *Xian*, signifying mutual resonance. The *Appended Remarks* state: "Heaven and Earth resonate, and the myriad things transform and are born." Thus, the Way of humanity is established in five relationships. The *Classic* says: "Husband and wife have their distinctions," and again: "Among the five universal Ways of the world, husband and wife are one." If a husband is upright and a wife chaste, this is called "ordering the household." The *Hexagram Household* states: "Man and woman in their proper places—this is the great meaning of Heaven and Earth." The *Commentary* says: "Even the foolish and unworthy among husbands and wives can participate in knowing and practicing." For male and female to dwell together is the great human principle. How could solitary Yin or lone Yang ever fulfill the human Way? Yet one must halt at utmost goodness. The Way of the noble one begins with husband and wife, and at its utmost, it scrutinizes Heaven and Earth. The *Book of Changes* begins with *Qian* and *Kun* and emphasizes *Xian* and *Heng*; the *Book of Songs* begins with *Guan Guan* and warns against lewdness; the *Book of Documents* records the rites of marriage and the great wedding feast.

Immortals have never been without this. Liu and Ruan on Tiantai, Liu Yuan on the island—all encountered immortal maidens. Once, a recluse who sold medicines for a living heard that a musician’s daughter, possessed of beauty, was to be married for five hundred thousand coins. The recluse offered seven hundred strings of cash, took the girl home, and after several years, when the matter was complete, her parents missed her and visited. In the mountains, they found a magnificent towered abode. The girl’s husband welcomed and bowed to them, keeping them for several days. After one meal, they were never hungry again. At parting, he gave them five ingots of gold to take home. Later, when their money ran out, they returned but found nothing—only empty mountains. Were these not immortals as husband and wife?

The *Elixir Classic* says:
"To cast aside one’s wife is to vainly sever Yin and Yang;
To cease eating is to futilely empty the stomach and intestines."
The Ancestral Heavenly Master, Master Ge, and Master Xu—did they ever abandon their wives and children before attaining immortality?

The Way of the Golden Elixir requires the Yellow Dame as matchmaker, the joyful union of the Azure-Clad Maiden and the White-Clad Gentleman. Husband sings, wife follows; Yang intones, Yin harmonizes. After ten months, the sacred embryo is complete, and the Infant and the Maiden of Cinnabar suddenly manifest in form. Only then is the proof of the Female and Male merging in the Jade Chamber made clear—yet this is not the husband and wife of the mundane world.

Nine cycles return to seven—
This refers to the celestial tally of fire and timing. In the eleventh month, at the winter solstice, the hexagram *Fu* is practiced as the first return. In the twelfth month, *Lin* is the second return. In the first month, *Tai* is the third return and first reversal. In the second month, *Dazhuang* is the time for bathing. In the third month, *Guai* is the fourth return and second reversal. In the fourth month, *Qian* is the fifth return and third reversal. In the fifth month, *Gou* is the sixth return and fourth reversal. In the sixth month, *Dun* is the seventh return and fifth reversal. In the seventh month, *Pi* is the eighth return and sixth reversal. In the eighth month, *Guan* is the time for bathing. In the ninth month, *Bo* is the ninth return and seventh reversal—two Yin tallying Yang fire, advancing and retreating, drawing and adding. When the seventy-two periods of the celestial cycle are complete, by the tenth month, practicing *Kun*, one sheds the embryo and transforms spiritually.

One Yang arises at *Zi*, two Yangs at *Chou*, three Yangs at *Yin*—thus three Yangs make three returns, and Yang is already flourishing. Therefore, fire arises at *Yin* as the first reversal. By the ninth month, fire is already entombed, hence the seventh reversal. By the tenth month, fire is extinguished and reduced to ashes. Master Cui says: "Within a year, in the twelve hours, wherever the mind reaches, all can be done." He also says: "I urge you not to seek the winter solstice—within your body, a Yang naturally arises." From this, the celestial tally of fire cannot be absent, yet one must not cling to it. The perfected transmit the medicine but not the fire—one must seek an enlightened teacher.

Dispersing form throughout the Six Directions—
Upon reaching this point in the *Grand Cavern Scripture*, one attains the Yang Spirit, which exits and enters, dispersing its radiant forms to wander and feast beyond the Six Directions—beyond Heaven and Earth. One should practice shedding this illusory shell. When first emerging from the shell, one returns after a mile, lest disorder arise.

The Mud-Pill Palace is easily distinguished. Exiting and entering through the Gate of Myriad Wonders, one discerns departure and return. The ancients said: "If one penetrates the Mud-Pill Cavity, why trouble with the minor refinement of the Great Return?" Departing and returning again, when entry and exit become effortless, one may then seize the womb and usurp the dwelling.

The Supreme Perfected’s Ninefold Radiance Wheel—
Nine is the completion number of Metal. The Supreme August Perfected is the true Yang and upright *qi* of the self, generating a wheel of nine-colored radiance to gather the myriad spirits. This is the talisman of the Nine Lights, which corresponds to the ninefold perfection of Heavenly Metal.

The Tenfold *Quan* Script—
*Quan* refers to the ancient immortal Wo Quan, who in the time of Yao consumed pine nuts until his eyes became square. Having attained the Dao, he achieved what the *Scripture of Salvation* calls "ten revolutions to return the numinous." This is the true script of the Five Directions and Five Viscera, interwoven and intricate. Thus, the *Mysterious Contract* states: "Swilling is the fluid of the Five Viscera." The characters of the *Wenchang Grand Cavern*’s original text must not be altered, just as the *Numinous Treasure Scripture*’s *Danlou Ahui* or the *Sūrangama Sūtra*’s *śamatha, samāpatti,* and *dhyāna* are not to be changed. If they could be altered, translators of scriptures would render them in vernacular Chinese, but one must follow the ancient texts.

Preserve the primordial *qi* and ensure its flow—
Protect the Three *Qi* of Mystery, Origin, and Beginning within the adept’s body, allowing them to circulate without obstruction. The human body’s blood,荣 *qi*, and卫 *qi* must flow freely and harmoniously to ensure well-being, free from deep-seated illness. If stagnation occurs, other disorders arise, and preservation fails.

The Five *Qi* govern the central *Jie*—
The *qi* of the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—coalesce into the *Canghu Jie*. *Li* is the Dao; *zhong* is the Great Root. Together, they form virtue, nature, and life. When expressed externally, they become emotion; when moderated, they achieve harmony. Harmony is the attainment of the Dao, and the Dao and virtue are unified as one. Thus, timely application is fitting. The Five *Qi* governing the center—here the script is suddenly revealed within.

Transformation soars to the Upper Clarity—
One may undergo boundless transformations, unfathomable as yin and yang. With yin *qi* as the Jade Maiden and yang *qi* as the Immortal Youth, dragons and phoenixes of radiant clouds emerge from one’s own body, allowing one to ride them and ascend into the true realm of the Upper Clarity.

Three Thousand Deeds transcend all—
The Three Thousand Meritorious Acts and Eight Hundred Virtues must be perfected and transcended. Even those with great hidden merits—such as saving thousands of lives in a single effort—may achieve this. When the great merit is complete, one stands as a minister attending the Three Realms.

Many dissipate their essence and *qi* in pursuit of wealth, status, and sensual pleasures. When the body and life are suddenly abandoned, even wives, children, and closest kin turn away in disgust. Where then is the love of the bridal chamber and wedding candles? Only the turning of the karmic wheel remains—how can one hope to bear the Ninefold Radiance Wheel and witness the wondrous deeds of the Supreme Perfected?

The above jade script of celestial seal, eighty characters in all, governs above the Supreme Void of the Peerless Constant Fusion Heaven and rules below the Eighth Rampart of the Great Wind Marsh Earthly Sovereign. The *Mysterious Contract* states: "The Supreme Perfected’s Ninefold Radiance and the wondrous deeds of the Tenfold *Quan*—dual cultivation of the dwelling and the embryo, the spirit and the soul, the viscera and the bowels, the numinous and the primordial, the floral and the mountain, the primordial life and the divine—along with the *qi* of Brahma, the Beginning, the Primordial, and the Mysterious, the Dao *qi* governing the center, the perfected transforming into the true and the divine—when the Three Thousand Deeds are complete," the script swills the noble *qi*, naturally revolving tenfold to return the numinous, and the myriad *qi* ascend as immortals.

The Tenfold *Quan* represents the wondrous deeds of the Supreme Perfected: Heaven One, Earth Two; Heaven Three, Earth Four; Heaven Five, Earth Six; Heaven Seven, Earth Eight; Heaven Nine, Earth Ten. The script is the literary composition of the Tenfold *Quan* of Heaven and Earth, the jade fluid of the essence of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels within the human body. Thus, it is called "swilling the noble *xi*."

The Primordial Heavenly Sovereign said: "The *Wenchang Grand Cavern*’s Jade Script, Chapter Thirty: Earth’s Tenfold Perfection, the Ten Illuminations of Wondrous Deeds." *Xinwei, Renshen, Lü, Tai.*

The Supreme Mystery’s Nine *Qi* above—
The Three *Qi* of the Supreme Mystery, Supreme Origin, and Supreme Beginning reside above the Nine *Qi*. The concluding verse states: "The Supreme Mystery initiates the Ten Illuminations; wondrous deeds ascend to the Ten Perfected." It is also said: "The Supreme Mystery’s capital is the auspicious *qi* presided over by the Elder of the Nine *Qi*."

The mist revolves amidst the Supreme Splendor—
The Three *Qi* unite in virtue, and the Nine *Qi* converge as one, forming clouds and mist that revolve within the Supreme Void. *Taihui* is the name of a palace; other versions mistakenly render it as *Taixu* (Supreme Void). Here, the mysterious *qi* emerges above the Nine *Qi*.

The divine radiance shines upon the empty peak—
The divine and precious radiance is the numinous light, formless and intangible, emitting resplendent brilliance beyond the vast emptiness, in the ethereal and indistinct. In humans, the spirit’s radiance shines forth from the eyes. The "empty peak" refers to the head and face.

The Five Paths illuminate the Three Heavens—
The Five Paths are the Five Elders, shining brightly above the Three Heavens, their audience with the Emperor adorned in resplendent crowns. The Great Elixir’s Three Flowers gather at the summit; the Five *Qi* return to the Origin. The Three Heavens above are the Three Fields within the human body.

Riding the light, ascending the Absolute Empyrean—
Mounting the light-chariot to ascend the layered heavens, one reaches the Absolute Empyrean. This describes the Purple River Carriage conveying [essence] to the summit of Kunlun. As previously stated: "Riding the light amidst the morning radiance"—the meaning is the same. The Absolute Empyrean is unbound above and unsupported below.

Riding the wind, sweeping away stagnant spirits—
The immortal’s body is light, clad in a six-*zhu* robe, driving a flying wheel or feathered chariot, all of which can ride the wind and *qi*. "Sweeping away stagnant spirits" refers to the potent winds and vast *qi* within the Three Realms, where the Five Emperors and Great Demons command the demonic hordes of the heavens, blocking the paths. Only when great merit is complete and the Emperor observes and approves, when demon kings welcome and escort, when the Flowing Gold Fire Bell and the Five Elders open the way, may one ascend. Likewise, when the cultivator’s true *qi* is robust and wisdom-power unobstructed, the twin passes of the spine, the Heavenly Pillar, and the Jade City naturally open, leaving no stagnant spirits.

In the midst of the sun revolves a pearl—
Within the Central Palace, the Cinnabar Prime Lord, named Divine Revolving Pearl, ever turns in the Central Palace like the sun’s precious pearl. One tradition holds there is a revolving pearl within; another, that the pearl revolves within the sun—these do not align.

The Queen Mother of the West’s *wogu* method:
Visualize within the heart a sun as large as a *Chongning* coin, revolving with the heat of fire, descending to the Bubbling Spring, ascending to the Mud Pill, passing through the Three Palaces. After a thousand days, one may project the spirit.

The Lord of Life who governs the sun’s center and the Central Elder Lord of Life, together with the Divine Revolving Pearl, all guard the heart’s spirits. Among the myriad spirits of the heart, these are the most essential.

Govern the heart to enter stillness and tranquility.
With right principle govern these heart-mind thoughts, rendering them pure, settled, and undisturbed by phenomena. The *Yuanjue Jing* says: "By clarifying all thoughts, the movements of awakened knowing cease." The *Yijiao Jing* says: "Restrain it to one point, and nothing will remain undone." That one point is the clarified heart-mind.

The preceding speaks of Heaven; this speaks of the heart—for this heart is the Heavenly Heart. Cultivate within, and the without will respond. Without unity within, one cannot govern the without; without order without, one cannot nurture the within. Nurturing within and without in mutual accord, movement and stillness in resonant response—this is the fundamental purport of the *Great Cavern*. The Daoist scriptures only extinguish the moving heart-mind, not the illuminating heart-mind—this is likewise so.

Uniting the Three and Five Palaces:
Metal and Water share a single source, the One and Five; Fire and Wood share a common homeland, the Three and Five. The Central Palace of *wu* and *ji* unites the Three and Five, where the Four Images and Five Phases intermingle.

Formerly, the Daoist adept Xu and Zhang Huiming encountered the Right Radiant Lady of Mount Nanyue, who transmitted the Way of uniting the Three and Five. Both attained liberation through the corpse and became spirit immortals. Those who practice the Way of uniting the Three and Five will naturally escape the Three Wretched Realms and Five Sufferings, ascending to the Three-Five Heavenly Palaces, where they gain the joy and freedom of Heaven. Though they may live for aeons, brushing past stones, they will not cling to such joy, but advance in true cultivation toward the supreme realm.

Transforming through countless millions of years—
Living for countless millions of years, forever without decline, they accumulate the blessings of heavenly beings. Like an arrow shot into empty space, when its force is spent, it falls back down. But those who cultivate the Way of the *Great Cavern* Golden Elixir ascend directly to the ultimate position—how could they ever revolve in the cycle of rebirth?

"Felling the womb-tree’s earthly root"—
This line bears repeating, for the womb and embryo are matters of utmost weight, without which there can be no generation or transformation. Here, earth’s pairing is not in error: the primal yellow qi coalesces as the womb’s root, adhering to the spleen, all governed by earth’s generative number.

"Severing forever the corpse-blood’s root."
The ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears are all pervaded by the Dao’s qi, dissolving the karmic knots of past lives’ accumulated obstructions. The womb-tree and blood-root are metaphors for deep-rooted, firmly anchored bonds—yet through the merit of the *Great Cavern’s* precious scripture, all are felled and severed forever.

"The seven ancestors disperse their accumulated stagnations."
When forebears in past generations clashed in conflict, their curses took form as oral spells at spirit altars and temple shrines, entangling descendants in lawsuits, summons, and ancestral grievances. These stagnations, sealed in the hidden chambers of the unseen, could not be undone—until now, upon hearing the *Great Cavern’s* jade scripture, they are instantly released.

"Returning blossoms to the Dark and Mysterious."
The good sprout reverses its course, flourishing anew in the Dark and Mysterious Garden of the north, the land where Heaven’s One gives birth, the origin of the Three Powers. It is as when a person returns to the root in the Lower Prime, for the Sea of Qi governs the entire body.

"From the ten thousand qi, the ten thousand spirits are born."
The human body’s qi number in the tens of thousands—Mencius spoke of the vast qi filling heaven and earth. Yet if one fails to honor and secure the root, indulging in wine and lust, the qi gradually scatters. By middle and later years, it dwindles to mere thousands, leaving the spirits weary and strength exhausted. But if one knows and nurtures it, the ten thousand spirits are reborn.

The *Immortals’ Transmission* records that Master Wang of the Three Ones at Mount Lu’s Great Peace Palace dreamed of a divine messenger who declared: "The Supreme Emperor commands you to dwell in the Golden Flower Grotto-Heaven. He bestows upon you a single elixir pill to restore your spirit and replenish your primordial qi." The next day, he ascended. Thus we know: without the fullness of spirit and qi, one cannot become an immortal.

The *Classic* states: "Body, hair, and skin are received from father and mother—dare one not preserve them? This is the beginning of filial piety." Parents give life whole; a child should return it whole. Yet many, through wine, lust, wealth, and qi, damage their bodies. In the hidden courts of the unseen, they cannot escape judgment—how then can they hope for immortality?

"Equal the immortals, become an immortal king."
See the worthy and think to equal them.

Having walked shoulder to shoulder with the perfected immortals and accomplished the immortal Dao, one is acclaimed and upheld by all immortals—hence the title "Immortal King." Even among immortals, there are those who don the regalia of kingship. The office of Wenchang, the stellar immortal, attains its utmost nobility at this stage.

The Supreme Mystery initiates the Ten Illuminations,
The Supreme Mystery unfolds the Ten Illuminated Wondrous Practices to receive and deliver those with karmic affinity.
The Supreme Mystery is the progenitor of the Three Qi, giving birth to heaven, earth, and the myriad things. Here, the number is complete, and with the fulfillment of the Ten Illuminated Wondrous Practices, one ascends to the Ten Perfected.
The Wondrous Practices ascend to the Ten Perfected.
When the Ten Illuminated Wondrous Practices reach perfection, one attains the rank of Supreme Mystery Perfected.
The Ten Illuminations and Ten Perfected—ten being the number of earth’s completion—are thus made clear. In the *River Chart*, this is the complete number. The six unbroken lines of pure yang form Qian, which pertains to the radiance of metal. Then one perceives all realms and things as illusory, all affairs as dreams, principles and dharmas as eye floaters or empty blossoms, and all conditioned actions as reflections in a mirror. Thus, one regards sounds and sights as enemies, honors and ranks as dung and dirt, and life and death as morning and evening. In responding to matters and engaging with beings, one weighs with emptiness and balances with equanimity—only then does one verify the Supreme Mystery’s Wondrous Practices.

The above jade scripture in celestial seal comprises ninety characters, governing above the Great Release Jade Exaltation Ascendant Heaven and presiding below over the Eighth Rampart’s Lord of Blessing and Virtue.

The *Mysterious Covenant* states: The Supreme Mystery’s Ten Illuminated Wondrous Practices and Ten Perfected are:
Perfected Essence, complete;
Perfected Qi of the Mysterious Pearl;
Perfected Spirit of Mysterious Power;
Perfected Nature of Mysterious Penetration;
Perfected Unity of the Primordial;
Perfected Life of Mysterious Wonder;
Perfected Form of Mysterious Radiance;
Perfected Virtue, complete;
Perfected Dao of the Mysterious Cavern;
Perfected Response, complete.

The Supreme Mystery’s Ten Perfected—wondrous practices and ascetic conduct—are the celestial horizontal script. They firmly root the myriad practices, encircle the six positions, and have ascended to the Wondrous Practices. The Great Complete Form takes shape, qi and essence refine into the Purple Gold of endless life—thus is the Supreme Mystery Perfected.

The Primordial Heavenly King declares: The thirty-first jade scripture of the Great Cavern of Wenchang corresponds to the two trigrams Qian and Dui, whose tone is akin to metal.
*Guiyou*, *Jiaxu*, *Pi*, *Tongren*.
Beyond the Utmost Clarity’s Absolute Radiance...

Above the Grand Clarity lies the Highest Clarity—thus it is called "beyond the Absolute Radiance," which is none other than the Crimson Palace within the human body.

This scripture corresponds to the two trigrams Qian and Dui. Qian’s image stands loftily above, hence "beyond the Absolute Radiance." Qian begins by bestowing beauty and benefit upon all under Heaven, yet it does not speak of the magnitude of its bounty—how vast indeed! The *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture* universally nourishes the ten thousand existences without boasting of its power, whereas other scriptures proclaim that recitation alone yields such-and-such rewards, thereby vaunting their efficacy. Qian’s essence is firm, strong, pure, and unceasing; those who study the Dao must emulate Qian’s ceaseless vigor, preserving it continuously as if ever-present, to achieve eternal completion.

The Eight August Ones revolve through the Nine Heavens.
The Eight August Ones are the eight trigrams; the Nine Heavens are the nine palaces, as seen in the earlier Luo River Diagram’s numbers—here they need not be repeated.

Qian’s primal power employs the nine, yet Heaven’s virtue cannot be made its head. "Primal, prosperous, beneficial, and steadfast" are Qian’s virtues—thus it is said to "revolve through the Nine Heavens," signifying unyielding self-strengthening.

The Eight August Ones—Lord Lao revolving above the Nine Heavens—are the Eight Spirit Kings. "August" and "king" are one. The vastness of Heaven and Earth, how could it depart from the two qi of yin-softness and yang-firmness? The ceaseless revolution of these two qi—how could it stray from the convergence of the One Primal? Thus, the greatness of Heaven and Earth encompasses all principles, yet its essence is but One. The revolution of the One Primal—spring, summer, autumn, winter, crescent, full, waning, and new moons—never errs by even a single breath.

The *Book of Changes* states: "Observe the spirit-like Dao of Heaven, and the four seasons do not deviate. The sage establishes teaching through the spirit-like Dao."

Verily, in the alchemy of the Elixir, it is termed "fire and timing," corresponding to the Great Yang’s yearly revolution through the celestial circuit. With three hundred days of practice complete, one may ingest and refine it.

The Dark and Vast Mysterious Emperor-Son—refer to Chapter Two of the preceding scroll—is the Dark and Vast Profound Void, also called the Dark and Vast Nonexistent. The soul of the August One ascends as the Emperor-Son. These two spirits jointly guard the lower Cinnabar Field. The visualization method: the Dark and Vast Black Emperor-Son is crimson.

They carry the person within this vision. The Dark and Vast and the Emperor-Son, these two, can uplift the person within this vision, symbolizing the indestructibility of one’s Dharma-body through kalpas. By this uplifting, one remains perpetually wakeful and unobscured, free from the veils of selfish desire and the incursions of love and aversion.

At dawn, ascend to the Chamber of the Heavenly Elder. At midnight, the Zi hour, rise to the Palace of the Heavenly Elder. As recorded in the *Seven Stars Spirit Incantation Scripture of the Heavenly Elder Sovereign*, this corresponds to the liver. The incantation: "The sun rises in the east, radiant with great light." This is the Mao hour, when true qi is transmitted to the liver.

At dusk, feast in the Court of Golden Splendor. In the evening, wander and banquet in the Court of Golden Splendor, which is the lungs, representing the Dui trigram. One version reads "Golden Splendor Convenience," which is erroneous. At the You hour, true qi is transmitted to the lungs. At the feast, one drinks golden nectar and jade fluid, consuming intersecting pears and fiery jujubes.

With a feathered standard, summon the Great One. Using a feathered banner as a tally, summon the Great One Sovereign—see prior annotations. The Great One resides in the head, holding the talisman to summon the ten thousand qi and ten thousand spirits of the inner landscape. Spirits follow qi in motion, all gathering and congealing to pay homage to the Great One Sovereign.

With brocade banners, summon the ten thousand spirits. "Spirit" is that which subtly pervades the ten thousand things. Throughout this chapter, brocade banners and flags serve as instruments to attract the true and summon the numinous. Things gather by kind, and beings assemble by group; thus, feathered standards and brocade banners each summon their own kind.

Fortify my Six Transcendent Palaces. The Six Palaces: the large intestine is the Palace of the Minister of State; the small intestine, the Palace of Primal Yang; the gallbladder, the Palace of the Orchid Terrace; the bladder, the Palace of Supreme Harmony; the stomach, the Palace of Supreme Simplicity; and the Triple Burner, the Palace of the Ultimateless. The sage rides the six dragons to govern Heaven. Heaven circulates the six qi to regulate the myriad beings; humans harmonize the six bowels to resist external pathogens. Thus, it is said: "Strengthen the qi of the five viscera and six bowels within the omen-body." When firm, they form the Six Transcendent Palaces; when scattered, they become the Six Cavernous Malevolent Demons, mutually harming and destroying, all due to the disturbances of emotion and desire, which corrupt the Six Caverns and Six Heavens.

Strike down the roots of the womb and embryo. Sever the roots of the womb and embryo, preventing their proliferation. These dead roots must be entirely eradicated. Only when the dead roots are cut off can the living roots grow, flourish, and thrive, becoming a lush forest of merit and success.

Unbind the knots of the seven ancestors, allowing them to ascend to the heavenly halls and enjoy blissful non-action. One version reads "unbind the knots, the seven ancestors live," which is a confused and disordered phrasing. Simply cultivate a mind turned toward goodness, and the seven ancestors will naturally ascend to Heaven.

Dispel calamities and pacify the nine lineages. Dissolve the misfortunes of the nine lineages, bringing them peace. When the six yin are exhausted, the nine yang begin to form. The *Book of Changes* states: "Vigilant as if facing danger, there will be no blame." When one attainment becomes eternal, continuous as if ever-present, calamities will naturally dissipate, sinking deep beneath the nine earths.

The Crimson City and the Elixir Terrace Maiden—some say the Crimson City is the Crimson and Azure Sea Palace of the Sun Sovereign’s Dark Continent, located beneath the Nine Empyreans, called the First Empyrean. The Elixir Terrace and Purple Mansion are the Palace of Yang Brightness, where many jade pavilions of female immortals reside, such as the Silver Palace of Yang the Supreme.

According to the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, the four greatest mountains in the Eastern Sea—Mount Penglai, Mount Fusang, Mount Fangzhang, and Mount Canglang—have beneath them the Three Islands and Ten Continents: first, the Dark Continent; second, Yingzhou; third, Zuzhou; fourth, Juquzhou; fifth, Yanzhou; sixth, Linzhou; seventh, Liuzhou; eighth, Changzhou; ninth, Yuanzhou; and tenth, Shengzhou. Later in this chapter, it speaks of the Dark Continent’s Three Ferries, the Cang Terrace’s Flying Feather Wheel, and ascending Fusang—all within the Eastern Sea’s domain. Those who attain the Dao inevitably pass through here, shedding their illusory bones, receiving ranks and robes, and then ascending to the heavenly realms to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones.

Support the omen and enter the Golden Gate. Qian resides in the northwest, belonging to Metal, and is the Gate of Heaven—hence, the Golden Gate. This maiden of the Dui trigram assists my body in ascending together through the Golden Gate. One version reads "summon with talismans to enter the Golden Gate," which is erroneous. The gate of the lord of the world is also called the Golden Gate.

The Moon Mother, Numinous Plain Orchid—Dui is the trigram of the moon. The moon goddess is the essence of Great Yin, named Numinous Plain Orchid (or Tranquil Plain Orchid, which is erroneous). The correct Dharma name for the moon incantation is Numinous Plain Orchid. The *Dipper Scripture* states: "She governs the netherworld and presides over the sources of water."

Guard and seal the Gate of Dead Qi. The essence of the moon constantly guards the lower origin, sealing the Gate of Dead Qi. These four lines all pertain to the Scripture of the Feminine One. The Elixir Terrace Maiden, the yang spirit, desires the person’s ascent, while Tranquil Plain Orchid, the yin spirit, can obstruct the Gate of Death for the person, channeling the flow of living qi.

From this day, dead qi is cut off. Having sealed the Gate of Death, dead qi is severed. Confucius said: "Without knowing life, how can one know death?" The Dao of the Great Cavern knows both life and death, just as the *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* states: "Trace beginnings to their ends, and thus understand the discourse on death and life."

From here, the springs of life extend. The shores of the springs of life may be glimpsed and crossed. The Buddha said: "The patience of non-arising—if there is no arising, how can there be ceasing? If one comprehends non-arising, one must seek liberation, releasing all dharmic bonds, directly attaining purity in the ten thousand conditions, with nothing to be grasped."

The ten thousand spirits and ten thousand qi become immortals. Clouds move and rain descends, shaping the myriad forms. Thus, the ten thousand qi give rise to the ten thousand spirits. The immortals of the ten thousand qi are the ten thousand spirits returning to oneness, as in the Supreme Ultimate Diagram’s generation of the ten thousand things—this is the root of Heaven and Earth’s ceaseless generation.

Ascending beyond, one attains the position of the True King. As the Qian Dao transforms and evolves, each fulfills its nature and destiny. Thus, transcending and surpassing the barrier of life and death, one verifies and ascends to the rank of the Great Cavern True King. The previous chapter spoke of becoming an Immortal King; through further cultivation, one now reaches the position of the True King of Longevity.

The ten perfections of wondrous practice are complete. The "ten perfections" refer to sincerity without falsehood. Sincerity is the Way of Heaven; the pursuit of sincerity is the Way of humanity. With utmost sincerity unceasing, and unceasing thus enduring, one attains the ten perfections of wondrous practice, fully realizing the ten perfections of wondrous practice from the previous chapter.

The Supreme Mystery unites with the luminous yang. Above the nine heavens, yin qi does not intrude; within the nine earths, yang light is forever obstructed. Thus, the Supreme Mystery qi within my body converges with the luminous yang heaven. In a later chapter, the union of my body with luminous yang shares this same meaning.

The Supreme Great Cavern Honored One. Here, one meets the Great Personage. The Great Cavern Emperor Honored One of oneself manifests—this is the noble one of the limitless and supreme rank, equal in glory to Heaven and forever free from decline. All these belong to the Great Brahma Heaven of the formless realm above.

One qi harmonizes with the dragon’s radiance. Qian is a yang entity, hence the dragon serves as its metaphor—terms like "hidden dragon," "manifest dragon," and "flying dragon" all arise from the primordial one qi. If one cultivates the Great Cavern of the self with benevolence, then one’s qi and virtue unite with the strength of Qian, ceaselessly striving. Dui represents joy and delight, an ineffable celebration. Through cultivation to this point, the yin lines are entirely shed, transforming the mortal form into a body of pure yang and purple gold. Spirit embraces qi, and qi embraces spirit; essence and spirit are refined and luminous, qi and pulse harmonious and smooth. Like the joyous union of husband and wife, like the tender attachment of mother and child, one awaits the moment of spiritual transformation.

The above jade verse in celestial script comprises one hundred twenty characters, governing above the Dragon Transformation Brahma Liberation Heaven and presiding below over the Eighth Rampart’s Lord of Vision and Virtue.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: When the essence and qi of one’s body are fully refined into the six positions of purple gold, having ascended to the perfection of wondrous practice and the boundless longevity of the Supreme Mystery Realized One, one turns the light inward to open and deliver the root of the embryo. The seven mysteries and nine ancestors are all released from karmic entanglements, debts and disputes severed, the gate of death sealed. Those of shared qi and shared root are revived, their life-springs nourished, their myriad spirits extended. Together they transcend to the True King, harmonizing the myriad qi, their wondrous practices all complete. All are named the Supreme Mystery’s Heaven of Luminous Yang. I alone ascend beyond, verifying the Great Cavern Honored Emperor of the One Dragon Radiance, styled the Supreme Mystery of the Unsurpassed.

*Jade Purity’s Limitless Total True Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals*, Scroll Nine. (Here, a "Heaven" character may be missing.)

Jade Purity’s *Limitless Total True Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals*, Annotated Scroll Ten
Annotations by Zhongyangzi Wei Qi of Mount Penglai in Eastern Shu

The Primordial Heavenly King states:
The thirty-second jade chapter of the *Wenchang Great Cavern* corresponds to the *Zhen* and *Xun* trigrams, its tone belonging to Wood.

*Yihai*, *Bingzi*, *Dayou*, *Qian*.
The Eastern Florescence emits its first radiance,
The Lofty Morn illumines the Upper Clarity.
The Judgment Office of the Eastern Florescence and the Square Cauldron Palace is also the abode of the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering—a land revering benevolence and treasuring life. Here, the Nine Dragon Talismanic Commands deliver the shades of the dead. "Emits its first radiance" refers to the initial arising of the single yang line, like the sun’s ascent. "Lofty Morn" is also called the Azure Lad, named Morning Sun. As the sun ascends high, it must illumine the true realm of the Upper Clarity. This signifies that when human true qi gathers in the heart’s palace, it issues forth from the liver’s viscera, then begins its transmission, reaching the Crimson Palace by midday.

Resplendent, the round pearl glows with misty haze;
The radiant brilliance shines resplendently within the azure-gemmed pearl, its misty vapors thick and luxuriant. All these are metaphors for the qi of the heart-pearl: the spirit’s light, perfectly round and luminous, penetrating the eight chambers, emptying the five aggregates, a treasure of purity and clarity.

Brightly gleams the purple radiance.
"Brightly" means luminous. Sunlight generates purple radiance, shining with clarity. The liver’s spirit, Dragon Mist Containing Brightness Lord, corresponds to the liver—this is Wood’s resonance. Both *Zhen* and *Xun* belong to the East’s Wood, above corresponding to Jupiter, below governing the liver.

The Seven Morns return to the Emperor’s seat;
The sun spirit named Seven Morns Returning ascends to the Heavenly Emperor’s mat, for the Emperor emerges from *Zhen* and is arrayed in *Xun*. Lesser Yang is *Zhen*, ascending in *Xun* to join *Qian*, the position of six yang lines in perfect fullness—hence, the Emperor’s seat.

The Five Elders fly the jade carriage.
When the Most High depart, the Five Elders must open the way, the host of immortals flanking the chariot. True immortals and cultivators are likewise attended—these are the transformations of the five qi.
As the *Scripture of Salvation* states: "The Five Emperors serve as guards; the Three Realms bow in reverence." The same applies here.

The Great One, King within the radiance;
The Great One resides atop the head, sovereign within the radiance—see earlier annotations on the "person within the radiance."
It is also said: "King within the radiance." One should esteem the head as the body’s leader, thus addressing this spirit as king.

The Controller of Destiny gathers the ten thousand spirits.
The flying jade talisman-carriage summons the ten thousand spirits, all riding the *Xun* wind. Thus, to summon spirits is to gather wind. The Controller of Destiny dwells in the heart, governing all spirits—the heart is the master of thunder.
The *Thunder Scripture* states: "If the heart-fire does not flare, Deng Jun does not roar; if the liver-spirit does not rage, Xin Shu does not stir; if the intent-spirit does not arise, the messengers do not move."
For the liver belongs to *Zhen* and *Xun* as Yi Wood, while the heart-fire activates it—this is the image of striking and drumming. Thus, it can gather and command the ten thousand spirits.
Moreover, *Zhen* is thunder, manifesting in humans as sound; *Xun* is wind, manifesting as breath and qi. Hence, the eight trigrams represent the body.

Buoyantly amid the clouds and waves,
Water converges in the southeast’s *Xun* region. This describes how, at this time, true qi steams and vaporizes, essences and fluids irrigate, and one’s original spirit surges upward. The two trigrams oppose each other in the primordial arrangement, their image being "thunder and wind clashing"—thus they stir and animate the myriad transformations.

Silently gazing upon the Mud-Pill Palace.
Following the *Xun* wind, the noble one issues commands and acts, resolutely assuming a stern countenance, standing at the center of the world. Summoning the Three Officials and Five Peaks, the Mud-Pill Palace’s gates stand at the highest summit. "Silently" means without sound; "gazing" means looking back.

Seven revolutions summon the Three Officials;
Seven revolutions of the true talismanic command summon the Three Officials—within the person, these are the spirits of the three fields. Advancing and retreating benefit from martial vigor; human integrity requires awe-inspiring might. If governance is not smooth, only wind and thunder suffice to startle and rouse the myriad beings.

The Northern Lord bows and proceeds.
The North takes precedence, initiating the Five Directions. Following the season, one ascends the original spirit, rising from the kidneys and navel, traversing the five viscera, and mounting to the Mud-Pill. The true spirits of the three barriers and five viscera all attend and ascend together.

The Five Peaks respond to the command and arrive;
The Five Peaks respond to the summons and come—all five qi mutually resonate and assemble. Thunder and lightning wield the power of life and death, the offices of rewarding good and punishing evil. Thus, when thunder moves and wind flies, the myriad spirits gather—how could any delay be tolerated?

Erasing death, inscribing long life.
The Three Officials and Five Peaks all strike out the registers of death, inscribing the character for life. The two images inverted form the *Yi* hexagram. The *Appended Judgments* state: "The noble one, seeing goodness, moves toward it; having faults, reforms them." This is what it means. For humans, it is a matter of putting it into practice.

Three invocations of the *Zhen*-Spirit Talisman;
Heaven possesses the *Zhen*-Spirit Talisman, which commands the qi of life and subdues demonic essences.
Nothing agitates the myriad beings faster than wind; nothing stirs them faster than thunder. Thus, thunder holds the power of life and death: like thunder-water, it can split open the husks of fruits, grasses, and trees—this is its life-giving aspect. When thunder moves and wind races, cutting away calamities and chaos—this is its death-dealing aspect.
Thus, this chapter’s opening and closing lines state: "Erasing death, inscribing long life; mystically dissolving great demonic essences"—demonstrating the handle of life and death. In the earlier "Primordial Beginning and Great Ultimate" chapter, the *Zhen*-Spirit appears three times; see the detailed annotations above.

Mystically dissolving great demonic essences.
The *Xun* Gate is the Divine Empyrean Palace, the source of wind and thunder. It can wondrously dissolve the great demons of the Six Heavens, preventing their disturbances. Those who study immortality must tremble at *Zhen*’s coming—"thunder startles a hundred leagues"—all should fearfully cultivate and reflect.

Seven ancestors born in the Hall of Blessings;
The seven ancestors of the nine mysteries are all born in the great Hall of Blessings in heaven, roaming carefree—this is the fortune of heavenly beings. When their fortune is exhausted, they do not descend to be reborn among strange kinds. Cultivating the *Wenchang Great Cavern* is the supreme Dharma-gate, reaching the Three Clarities’ realm.

The Mysterious Flower Preserves the Yellow Tranquility.
By the Mysterious Flower preserving and nurturing the Yellow Tranquility Child within the spleen and stomach, one ensures it never declines or falls—this is the Way of long life and enduring vision.

The two images unite to form the Hexagram *Heng*. The *Appended Judgments* say: "The sage abides long in the Way, and all under heaven is transformed and enriched." The *Judgment* states: "Heaven bestows, earth produces—together they move with the seasons." Those who cultivate the *Great Cavern* are not bound by time; wherever they dwell, with a single thought unmoving, the qi of heaven and earth arises. Its generation begins at *Fu* and ends at *Kun*; one ascent and one descent make a single celestial cycle. The qi of a full year is refined within a single moment—within the body, heaven and earth’s creative transformations unfold.

The right section contains ninety celestial seal-script characters of this jade chapter, which above stabilize the *Tai Ji*, *Ping Yu*, *Jia Yi*, and Heaven, and below govern the Eighth Rampart’s Lord of Blessings and Virtue.

The *Mysterious Covenant* states: "The seven ancestors and nine mysteries ascend to the heavenly halls; the myriad generations of ancestors and the Mysterious Flower are born together. Within, the Yellow Tranquility is preserved, and all kin ascend, all recorded in the immortal ranks and enrolled in *Nanchang*. The karmic debts of ten thousand generations—clan graves, tomb disputes, and the ledgers of exiled ghosts—are all pacified at once with the *Great Cavern Sutra of Immortals*. The earth’s roots and evil roots are severed and extinguished; the Way is unified, and long life arises naturally."

The Primordial Heavenly King says: "The thirty-third jade chapter of the *Wenchang Great Cavern* manifests the two hexagrams *Kan* and *Li*, the Way of *Ji Ji*. It is transformed by the mysterious qi of the *Tai Qing* immortal realm. The Supreme Thearch’s Nine Elders’ Capital..."

The moistener of the myriad things—none is more moistening than water. Thus, of all the manifold kinds, none does not rely upon it for life. Water flows through the earth’s midst; the Yangzi, Yellow, Huai, and Han rivers all pay homage to the sea, each governed by its appointed overseers. Therefore, the Fusang Great Thearch and the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords of the East jointly administer the Water Palace, which serves as the grand assembly of all watery domains. Now, the origin of water arises in the north: Heaven’s One gives birth to it, Earth’s Six completes it, and it emerges from the *Kan* position. Thus, this chapter is represented by the hexagram *Kan*. The *Book of Changes* says: “Water repeatedly flows into the abyss; the noble one, by constant virtue, practices and teaches affairs.”

**Inspecting Immortals Ascend Fusang.**
When the immortal registers are examined, those who have attained the Dao ascend to Mount Fusang in the Eastern Sea. It is said that human essence-qi is born in the kidneys and transmitted to the liver, then to the heart’s palace. Thus, below it is said: “The divine network and essence-qi within the human body are like water flowing through heaven and earth.”

**Sevenfold Summons to the Heavenly Thearch.**
The Heavenly Thearch is the Jade Thearch, summoned by the mandate of the Primordial Beginning to the Muddy Pellet Palace in the brain’s central palace. All merits and transgressions of the Three Realms’ true immortals and worldly people are presented to the Jade Thearch by the Three Officials and Five Peaks.

**The Controller of Destiny Rides the Divine Network.**
This represents the hexagram *Li*, which in humans is the heart. The heart’s spirit rides its divine network to ascend and pay homage. The heart is the abode of spirit, thus possessing a guiding principle. *Li* is the image of radiant clarity, so the heart-spirit delights in illuminating and discerning affairs.

**The Five Peaks Open the Spirit-Gates.**
The peaks are the face, and the spirit-gates are the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose. Opening them enables control over demons; closing them and losing their numen allows demons to turn one about. When the Five Peaks all open their spirit-locks, they heed the Thearch’s command.

**Transmitting the Decree to the Great Demon King.**
Receiving the Jade Thearch’s mandate to restrain the Great Demon, the navel is the palace of the Northern Yin, the domain where yin and evil prevail. Thus, the decree is transmitted to restrain them, preventing reckless disturbance. The demons are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and intent.

**Rivers and Seas All Receive Their Duties.**
Even a single ladle of water may harbor soft-shelled turtles, alligators, dragons, fish, and turtles, and yield wealth and prosperity. The lords of rivers and seas—dragons and their kind—receive their duties and heed the commands of Fusang. From Heaven’s One generating water in the *Kan* position to the completion of heaven and earth, the birth of worthies and sages all arises therefrom. The River Earls, Sea Spirits, aquatic deities, and water immortals all receive and fulfill their originally appointed offices. Like Tao Hongjing, who served as Vice Director of Waterways, or Guo Pu, who became the Water Inspector Immortal Earl, and the Four Seas Ladies who govern female immortals in the waters, humans and aquatic beings may intermingle as immortals.

This account describes the jade’s traversal of the water palaces of the Yangzi, Yellow, Huai, and Eastern Seas, and the dragon palaces: westward from the Shu River, southward from Hengtan, and southwest from Yuan and Jing, where the three rivers converge at Dongting, then flow down to the Han River, meeting Dabie, reaching Mount Lu; southeast from Ji and Gan, converging at Pengli, then flowing down to Yizhen, where the Huai and Yellow Rivers meet from the north and south at Zhenjiang, then flow down to Kunlun Mountain and eastward into the sea. From Zhenjiang, passing through Chang and Su, entering the three hundred and sixty expanses of Tai Lake, reaching Wushan to meet the Zhe River; southeast from Fuxin River to meet the Zhe; from Weiyang, sailing upstream through the Huai, passing Lüliang to enter the Ji; from Mount Tai to meet the Ji; from the Ji, sailing upstream to Linqing, entering the Hutuo, northeast to meet Xiaozhigu and enter the sea; from Zhigu, sailing upstream to the capital, observing along the way Qutang, Dongting, Pengli, and Tai Lake—how magnificent the dragon palaces!—and seeing the Three Water Palaces of Madang Mountain, Caishi, and Jinshan. How could they not receive their duties from the sea?

**Establishing the Corresponding Directions for Assembly.**
Stagnant pools have no root to rely upon, but the Yangzi and Han rivers pay homage to the sea, each in its due time. The cinnabar classics say: “Heaven corresponds to the stars, earth to the tides; in heaven, metal is born, and on earth, water is born.” Thus, at each month’s crescent, full, waning, and new moons, the sea’s waters rise and fall accordingly. Each day, a single tide begins in the Eastern Sea, surging like a snow-capped mountain, passing the sea’s mouth and flowing upstream, traversing Zhe to halt at Caishi in the west, at Yanling Shoals in the southeast, and at Xiaozhigu in the northeast. Day and night, their assembly is unerring. Likewise, in the human body, each day and night, the blood and qi make a single circuit to the fontanel. When the tide arrives, one sits in silent stillness, concentrating the spirit and thought, and hears the blood and qi rushing from heel to crown, the rustling sound of their convergence, like a swarm of ants climbing, the turning sounds of the five viscera and six bowels. Inner and outer correspond, manifesting in the four limbs and reaching the auditory organs. After a long while, they gradually disperse, and all becomes silent. This, too, is a great principle of cultivation.

The sage’s transformative work cannot be entrusted to empty words. Through skillful analogies and clear metaphors, making the near taken from the body and the far from things, even if one cannot observe the sea’s tides from afar, one may listen closely to the ebb and flow of the blood’s glory and the qi’s defense—one myriad, three thousand, and five hundred breaths’ tide. Is this not showing people the corresponding directions for assembly?

**Preserving the Talisman Within the Muddy Pellet.**
Wine jars and sacrificial vessels may be offered to kings and dukes or presented in ancestral temples. How much more should the preserved talismanic contracts, all stored in the Muddy Pellet Palace, await Peach Health? Yin talismans and yang fire all gather in the Upper Prime Palace.

**Guarding the Spirit is Called Peach Health.**
Stirred and raised, it may pass over the forehead. Water is born in the kidneys, and when transported by the Dao, it flows upstream to the Muddy Pellet. Peach Health is the spirit within the kidneys, singularly transporting yang essence to the brain’s rear to assist primordial yang and complete the golden elixir.

**Reversing the Name in the Ledger of the Dead.**
Having obtained the root of ceaseless life, one reverses and changes one’s name in the ledger of the dead, leaving no transgressions to be recorded. The ledger of the dead is the Black Register, where all human transgressions, calamities, and deaths are fully recorded.

**Recording the Fire King of the Immortal Uncle.**
Chapter Three of the Upper Scroll states: "Gao Tongsheng, the Fire King of the Uncle." Here it is abbreviated as "Fire King of the Uncle," for this is the scripture of the Primordial One. The Fire King of the Uncle is the Dao Father, exclusively overseeing the ledgers of the immortals, to which all who attain the Dao are appended.

**Severing the Ledgers of the Three Paths of Suffering.**
The *Kan Hexagram* states: "Bound with cords and fettered in thorns." This is the place of imprisonment and reflection on transgressions, like King Wen’s confinement in Youli or Tai Jia’s in Tong Palace. Now, severing the Three Paths and altering the ledger of the dead—does this not embody this very principle?

**Dispelling Misfortune to Give Birth to the Upper Flower.**
The True Fluid Sovereign within the heart, named Feisheng Shangying, governs the blood and fluids. The *Book of Changes* says: "Kan is not full, yet it levels—no blame." For now, misfortune is dispelled but not yet wholly eradicated. Cutting away the root of calamity, one gives birth to the Upper Flower’s splendor.

**The Seven Mysteries Ascend the Vermilion Palace.**
The Vermilion Palace resides atop the *Li* hexagram. The Seven Mysteries and the Nine Ancestors ascend to the Vermilion Numinous Fire Mansion, where refinement occurs naturally. This is the union of water and fire, the dual cultivation of qi. The immortals Ge Xian and Huang Yuyang both attained the Dao through such alchemical rites.

**My Body Meets the Radiant Yang.**
The omen of the body’s audience with the luminous realm of the Great Yang Dao. The *Precelestial Book of Changes* states: "Water and fire do not repel each other." This scripture speaks of the Dao being accomplished through their union. The *Dou Scripture* says: "Water and fire are the true essence of the Dao; without them, generation and transformation cannot be achieved."

**The Upper Friend is Fang Yingzi.**
The Peach Health Lord of the Moon, Fang Ying, styled Yunliang, is befriended above—an affectionate and lingering attachment. The upper and lower spirits interchange, circulating divine qi, nourishing the root of life, fostering supreme harmony, and establishing the Four Greatnesses.

**The Lower Carries Li Weizang.**
The celestial essence-spirit within the womb, named Li Weizang, styled Fayun Zhu, guards the Water Sea of the Small Intestine, distinguishing the clarity and turbidity of its sources, guiding its discharge with the efficacy of Yu the Great. In humans, it is fitting to skillfully guide essence and blood.

**The Left Seizes the Luminous Chariot Lord.**
The Yellow Qi Lord within the womb, named Zu Mingche, styled Shen Wuji, guards the liver alongside the Bright Wheel of the Northern Dipper. Without the circulation of the myriad qi and spirits, the hundred bones, five viscera, four limbs, skin, and flesh would be but a lump of inert matter.

**The Right Assists Gui Shengchang.**
The White Qi Lord within the womb, on the right, named Xuan Guizi, styled Shengchang, guards the lungs. These two spirits, dwelling within the womb, jointly oversee the five viscera. As the preceding chapter states: "The White Qi nurtures Shangsheng," which conveys the same meaning.

**Uniting the Jade Radiance Qi,**
(One version mistakenly writes "Jade Capital.") Here, the left and right yin and yang qi merge, congealing like jade’s radiant essence to form the body’s shape. This qi, when exhaled, can boil tea; when held in the mouth, it can dry mercury.

**Transforming the Omen to Prosperity and Flourishing.**
To transmute one’s qi and substance, bringing auspiciousness and prosperity—this is the attainment of the Dao. Though foolish, one becomes wise; though weak, one becomes strong. The noble person follows it and finds fortune; the petty person turns from it and meets misfortune. This is not bestowed from without; it is inherently ours.

**Returning to the Infant of the Original Destiny,**
Reverting the spirit of one’s aging original destiny to the form of an infant, also called the Original Destiny Perfected Person. Cultivating the Great Cavern’s Dao, refining the myriad qi and spirits, one returns to the singular truth of the infant’s form, then transforms into primordial qi.

**The Sandalwood Blazes with Auspicious Harmony.**
Not the flute’s *Wusheng Melody* nor the stringless zither’s *Taiping Song*:
*"For years, the master has been poor to the bone,
Yet why does he joyfully embrace heaven’s harmony?
Only if one is a true listener should it be played—
Those who know not the tune must not be shown."*

**The Celestial One, Root of the Primordial Immortal,**
The Celestial One Noble Person emerges at the hours of *chou* and *wei*, serving as the primordial root of water. Thus, rivers and seas become the kings of all valleys, receiving waters. Truly, the Celestial One generates water, its source arising here. The meaning of the *Kan* hexagram is thus revealed.

**Abiding in the Wheel of Luminous Freedom.**
The Greater and Lesser Fortunes are the abodes of the sun and moon. The Northern Dipper’s *Qingyang* and *Tuoluo* govern their affairs. Thus, the Northern Dipper resides in the *Kan* palace, named the Lunar Mansion. The revolving luminous wheel aligns with the Bright Wheel of the liver, the radiant wheel of the sun and moon, the water pool and fire marsh.

**In all refinement, first refine the self.**
The heart is the fire of *Li*; the kidneys are the water of *Kan*. The essential task is their union. The method requires this heart to be empty and still, free from the slightest dust, with not a single thought stirring. The two qi merge, transforming into water and fire. The wandering soul, emerging from the left kidney, returns to the marsh to be refined and transmuted.

The above Jade Chapter of Heavenly Seal Script, comprising one hundred and thirty characters, descends from the Great Crimson Heaven, governing the Ninth Layer of the Boundless Abyss, the Realm of the Colorless Rigid Axis, the Earthly Sovereign Lord.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: "At this supreme vehicle’s gate, the adept’s body and ancestral lineage all attain true immortality, enabling the vast compassion to deliver and elevate beings of heaven and earth to realization."

These four chapters of the Perfected Person, the True Immortal King of the Great Clarity and Great Ultimate, correspond to the Four Heavens of the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor. They transcend hexagrammatic symbols, just as the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams lack stems and branches. *Qian* and *Kun* are the great parents, retiring to seclusion, while *Kan* and *Li* are the parents of the myriad things, thus held in esteem. The Three Clarities retire to nonaction, and the Jade Emperor governs affairs—all are revered, dwelling in the realm beyond color, unbound by hexagrammatic symbols.

Humans who cultivate the wondrous practices of the Great Cavern of Wenchang may transcend the Three Realms, directly ascending to the heavens of the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor, unbound by the Five Movements or the Eight Trigrams.

The Five Movements are the Five Phases and the stems and branches; the Eight Trigrams are also derived from the Five Phases. *Qian* and *Dui* belong to metal; *Zhen* and *Xun* to wood; *Kun* and *Gen* to earth; *Kan* to water; and *Li* to fire. The cultivator sheds the husk and departs the mechanism.

The Celestial King of Primordial Beginning states: "The thirty-fourth Jade Chapter of the Great Cavern of Wenchang corresponds to the *Kun* and *Gen* hexagrams, both of the same sound and belonging to earth."

The Upper Clarity’s true realm is transformed from primordial qi.

The Jade Clarity’s Myriad Flowers Palace—this Myriad Flowers Palace is the abode of the Jade Clarity’s Primordial Beginning, adorned entirely with gold, jade, and precious treasures, no different in splendor from the *Avataṃsaka*’s opulence. As previously stated: "To behold the *Avataṃsaka* is not equal to a single *Gen* hexagram." Now, the Myriad Flowers Palace reveals where one ought to abide. The noble person reflects that his thoughts do not transgress his station; he acts in accordance with his allotted place, finding fulfillment in every circumstance. This illustrates how one should rest content in the constant, abide in the realm of utmost goodness, free from partiality or reckless pursuit, upholding the rectitude of Heaven’s principle. Wealth and honor are the natural course, and all may partake in the Myriad Flowers Palace’s abundance.

The Lofty Immortals conceal the imperial scriptures. The *Kun* hexagram embodies the principle of nurturing and transformation. The *Book of Changes* states: "*Kun* conceals." The Lofty Immortals are where the celestial perfected store their scriptures—thirty-six sections, eighteen thousand scrolls. The Buddhist canon comprises five thousand forty-eight volumes in one collection. Since ancient times, the institutions of emperors and kings have ensured the preservation of maps and books throughout the realm, such as the *Lian Shan* of Shennong, the *Gui Cang* of Xuanyuan, the *Lian Shan* of Yu the Great, and the *Gui Cang* of Tang the Completer. Successive dynasties treasured these as divine instruments. Heaven, too, possesses its own maps and books, stored by the Celestial Emperor to govern the myriad heavens and administer the ten thousand kinds.

The *Chart of the Nine Heavens* presides. *Gen* halts here, marking the Way of Wenchang as perfect in every virtue. The noble person reveres uprightness within, embodies righteousness without, and embraces service to the sovereign—this is the Way of the minister. The Lofty Immortals and Perfected Sages oversee the registers and charts in the Nine Heavens, directing the mechanisms of transformation to nurture the ten thousand things. Among the Nine Heavens is the Eastern Wall Repository of Maps and Books. The *Kui* constellation governs literature, residing in *Xu*; the *Bi* constellation governs maps and books, residing in *Hai*. The Celestial Emperor commanded the August Person of Wenchang, the Mysterious Sage and Dao Lord Confucius, to preside over the *Chart of Wenchang’s Generative Qi*, circulating true qi to engender and transform the ten thousand things, assisting the imperial enterprise. The Emperor bestowed the investiture: Supreme Perfected of the Great Ultimate and Mount Jiuyi, True Lord of the Eastern Sea and Broad Mulberry Mountain, Grand Thearch of Illuminating the Dao and Flourishing the Confucian Age.

Some may question: "Is this not Confucius’ Way? How could a great sage be subsumed into a heterodox teaching?" Yet they fail to realize that in Heaven, he is a constellation; on Earth, a river or mountain; in the unseen, a spirit; and in the manifest, once more a human. This is but the most evident aspect. Moreover, the great sage, in transmitting teachings for the world and establishing a model for ten thousand generations of emperors and kings, has received veneration and sacrifices across successive dynasties. How could he lack a fruition in the midst of Heaven, Earth, and humanity? Here, he is appended to this discourse, awaiting the discernment of the enlightened.

Observe the cavern and nothing gives birth. How sublime is the origin of *Kun*! The ten thousand things rely upon it for life. The birth of humans and things proceeds from nothing to being, receiving *Kun*’s complete qi. Thus it is said: "*Kun*’s thickness bears all things; its virtue unites with boundlessness." The cavern cannot be observed with the eyes; one must inwardly direct the mind’s gaze. From nothing, being arises—not that nothingness is void, but that it abides in serene constancy. One must not seek outwardly or falsely assume existence. As with Sudhana’s visions, all dwelled within Samantabhadra’s body. This Dao is emptiness and spontaneity, beyond grasp or comprehension. One need only turn the light inward to illuminate the self. Thus it is said: "Observe the cavern and nothing gives birth."

Seven revolutions summon the ten thousand perfected. This shares the same meaning as the seven revolutions that summon the Three Officials. The ten thousand perfected are the ten thousand spirits. Heaven possesses ten thousand perfected; humans possess ten thousand spirits. When Heaven’s true qi merges with human spirit, and Heaven’s qi harmonizes with human qi, the Dao is naturally attained. How could this not be precious?

The Five Marchmounts arrive at the courtyard. *Kun*’s expanse and *Gen*’s mountain—among these, the Five Marchmounts are supreme. A pinch of earth bears Mount Hua and stirs rivers and seas; a rolled stone nurtures plants and gives rise to treasures. How much more so when the Five Marchmounts lie within one’s grasp? The golden elixir is called the gathering of the Five Phases.

The Three Officials summon the host of demons. The Three Officials are the Three Passes. When their command is issued, the myriad heavens obey. Where the will leads, qi follows. When the Three Passes are opened, the Three Flowers gather at the crown. Among the Three Powers, only the Three and Five can govern the ten thousand transformations.

The Controller of Destiny examines the presented records. The Three Officials and Five Marchmounts report human fortunes and misfortunes. The Celestial Emperor commands the Controller of Destiny and Controller of Lifespans to reexamine and verify them before determining good or ill fortune.

Long ago, Nie Shaoyuan was fond of reading and studied the works of Zhuangzi and Laozi. One night, he dreamed of entering a city’s palace, where amidst solemnity, a crimson-robed official seated at a desk said: "This is the Office of Destiny. You may open the register and review your life’s affairs." Later, he received the complete register of the Great Cavern and cultivated the Dao of harmonizing and returning. One morning, as he bathed, four cranes alighted upon his roof. Villagers, seeing flames, rushed over, only to find Shaoyuan already transformed. Was this not the verification of the Controller of Destiny’s records?

Extract the register from the winding springs. The winding springs are the twelve river sources, the watery bureaus that govern human life, death, merit, and transgressions. Liu Yuan passed down that the watery bureaus belong to yin, administered by female immortals. In humans, these correspond to the twelve meridians, which are the twelve river sources.

Inscribe the name in the *Shangqing* register. The following lines, according to the Mao Mountain *Jade Scripture*, state: "The seven ancestors’ bonds are untied; impure blood wholly dissipates. Returning to the vermilion fire chamber, one is reborn within the cavern. The scribes and historians guard the divine body, enabling me to preserve yellow tranquility." These six lines continue the preceding, forming a section titled *The Chapter of the Three Primordial Lords*. Though the meaning repeats, the present text follows the Sichuan edition, appending the next fifteen lines to the prior ten, making twenty-five lines in total, preserved as a single chapter. No arbitrary alterations or additions are made to avoid confusing the reader. Proceeding thus, one may also attain the rank of upper immortal.

The Dark Continent severs the three fords. *Kun* is utterly yielding yet moves with firmness; utterly still yet its virtue is square. Thus, within the earth’s expanse lies the Dark Continent’s Crimson City Prefecture, beyond the Eastern Sea. Among the three isles and divine mountains, the Dark Continent is one of the ten continents. The three fords of weak water span thirty thousand *li*, each guarded by ford-keepers no one can overcome. Yet those who cultivate the golden elixir sever these fords, bypassing the passes to arrive home in a single step. As the ancients said: "Breach the fence, and it is your own estate." Cultivating the Way of Wenchang’s Great Cavern, one does not traverse the Three Realms’ myriad heavens or the twenty-five heavens, but instantly transcends to the realm of no outflows. Only then is the matter truly settled.

The Feathered Canopy ascends to the Court of the Great Void. Riding the feathered canopy and ascending in the radiant chariot, the Court of the Great Void lies far above the Formless Realm. As the *Tradition* states: "Virtue is light as a feather, yet even a feather has its measure." The burden of heaven bears all—soundless, scentless. The Feathered Canopy has form; the Great Void is formless.

Wheeling through the skies, it descends like drifting sands. Soaring and returning above the Nine Empyreans, the carriages and brushes of the perfected ones are myriad, grinding away the cloud-paths. Thus, they fly and scatter like desert sands drifting downward. In the time of Yu, a bird came from the Cinnabar Prefecture, exhaling five-colored mists of qi, called the Cloud-Riding Sparrow. It could fly in flocks, bearing green sand-pearls—light and fine—so that when the wind stirred, dust rose, called "pearl-dust," drifting down like desert sands. Those who obtained and ingested it became weightless and deathless. Is this not what is meant here?

The enlightened need not stir their feet; with the arising of a single thought, they ascend directly to the Round Summit. Another version reads *flying across the Milky Way*, the characters being somewhat similar.

Surrendering transformation, they merge with the ten thousand essences.

Embracing vastness and radiating greatness, all things attain flourishing—such is the virtue of Kun. Those who can gather and refine, moving in harmony with the times and merging with the myriad beings as one body, find nothing that does not come to fruition. Surrendering and transforming, they blend into the essence of the ten thousand things.

Five clouds thicken in the boundless void—five directions, five numina, five-colored clouds of qi, billowing and dense within the infinite sky. The qi of the five viscera steams and rises within the heart’s chamber, congealing into a pearl of perfect clarity, its radiant hues mirrored in the resplendent glow of rosy clouds. Thus, the five colors surge and blaze, illuminating the great emptiness.

Seven rosy clouds descend upon perfect clarity. The seven rosy clouds are the seven awakenings; one version reads: *a single numen descends upon perfect clarity*. This single numen is also the void and luminous, for the heart’s clarity is the heart’s spirit. Here, the seven-colored clouds and rosy mists outshine the sun and moon.

The *Scripture of Salvation* says: *The jade pivot and the balanced armillary halt their turning.* These lines describe the moment when lofty immortals gather with the Lords of Destiny, the Recorders, the Three Officials, and the Five Peaks. The throng of chariots and phoenix-borne carriages shines with such splendor—this speaks of one who can condense the myriad qi, allowing the spirit of the primordial numen to ride upon them. From the lower cinnabar field to the muddy pellet, the ten thousand qi congeal and the ten thousand spirits assemble, which is also a descent upon perfect clarity.

Bright and clear, the Recluse of the Profound Void—
The radiant Infant Boy appears below the navel. The two hexagrams unite in virtue; the *Judgment* of *Modesty* seeks to exhaust its meaning. The Way of Heaven diminishes the full; the Way of Earth transforms the full; ghosts and spirits harm the full. Yet modesty is honored and shines—such is the end of the noble one. This speaks of one who conceals their traces and hides their light, abiding in their proper place, unassuming yet manifest.

Thus, they attain the meaning of modest radiance. The noble one, dwelling in seclusion, seeks to fulfill their aspiration and practice virtue to realize the Dao. Naturally, their name resounds above and below. Though the Recluse of the Profound Void is formless and soundless, they shine with luminous clarity—this is what is meant by *though hidden, it is nonetheless evident*.

The flourishing of the numinous heart aids the tranquility of the Yellow Peace. The flourishing numen is the spirit of the heart; the Yellow Peace is the spirit of the spleen. This speaks of using the heart’s blood to nourish the spleen and stomach. The mutual generation and restraint of the Five Phases, when applied within a person, follow the circulation of qi to harmonize them, each according to its proper Way. For example, if the heart is afflicted, one circulates kidney water to aid it—this pattern applies to all five viscera.

Here, the two hexagrams oppose each other as *Splitting Apart*. The *Judgment* says: *The noble one esteems the waxing and waning of fullness and emptiness.* The Yellow Peace is the central palace, the Yellow Center that penetrates principle, rightly positioned within the body. Beauty resides within, spreading to the four limbs and manifesting in one’s undertakings. When a person’s bearing and conduct accord with the mean of the Dao, it is the utmost of abundant virtue.

The Five Elders scatter crimson blossoms—
The Five Elders are the primal ancestors of Heaven and Earth; the Five Elders within a person share the same qi. Thus, the five spirits gather in the Crimson Palace, wielding and scattering cinnabar blossoms. Burning incense and strewing flowers are both acts of the body’s numinous awareness; the crimson blossom and the cinnabar blossom are one.

They carry fragrant incense and jade numina. The Five Elders scatter the five fragrances to steam and nourish the numinous clarity of the five viscera. The *Upper Scroll* speaks of the Jade Longevity Numen, also the spirit of the stomach. To behold this spirit, one must focus the mind single-pointedly, like a cat stalking a mouse, eyes unblinking—thus, they attain condensation.

The golden substance is bathed in the Emperor’s River—
This is the refining of the jade pupils and the swaying of the yellow blossom to transform the form. The impure bones of the mortal body are now transmuted into a golden numen and jade substance. As previously said, *flesh and bones become gold and jade*—this is the true meaning of that golden form and jade quality, washed and cleansed in the river of the Primal Unity.

Green mists billow like flowing jade. Azure-green mists rise thick and dense, as if jade were about to flow. As previously said, *five clouds thicken in the boundless void*—all describe the ascent and descent of perfected immortals, where auspicious mists and propitious hues suffuse and purify the realm of empty vastness, their splendor surpassing all.

The Master of the Jade Emperor of the Upper Clarity—
The Upper Clarity Palace is the teacher of the Jade Emperor. The Numinous Treasure is the revered teacher of the Jade Emperor. The Jade Clarity, Upper Clarity, and Grand Clarity form the Three Treasures. Below the Three Clarities, the Jade Emperor is supreme. The Jade Emperor is the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Most Honored of the Myriad Heavens, second only to the Three Clarities. The *Scripture of the Heavenly Duke* says: *The Three Clarities retire to non-action; the Jade Emperor governs affairs.*

The Lord of the Great Dao of the Jade Capital—
The Jade Capital is the palace where the Lord of the Numinous Treasure, the Heavenly Worthy, resides—the Upper Clarity Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace, situated above the Grand Clarity and below the Jade Clarity, known as the Middle Primordial Palace. The Three Clarities correspond to the Three Sovereigns in the Confucian classics.

Together with the spirit of the Crimson Palace of the heart—
Master Void-and-Stillness said: *A sudden arising is sickness; not continuing it is medicine. Do not fear the arising of thoughts—only fear delayed awareness.* An ancient worthy said: *If one sits in stillness for a single moment, it surpasses building a seven-jeweled stupa. Though the stupa may eventually crumble to dust, a single thought unarisen attains true awakening.* Thus, when this heart does not give rise to a single thought, one instantly ascends to the sacred realm. Therefore, it is said: *flying to verify the Venerable of the Great Mystery.*

The heart governs the entire body, and its nature is void and numinous, sufficient to comprehend the principles of the ten thousand affairs and things in the world. Though these principles are scattered across the ten thousand affairs and things, their subtle and wondrous function lies nowhere but in the single heart of a person. As a former worthy’s poem says: *The Dao extends beyond the forms of Heaven and Earth; thought enters the ever-changing winds and clouds.* The Numinous Treasure and the heart-spirit are one heart—this is the heart of Heaven, not the fleshly heart. The spirit is the indestructible spirit across kalpas, not the spirits of sacrifice.

The *Book of Songs* says: *If the human heart unites with the heart of Heaven, the inversion of yin and yang takes but a moment.* Thus, it is said: *The Jade Capital and the heart-spirit fly to verify the Venerable of the Great Mystery.* For the heart of Heaven does not depart from perfect impartiality and utmost rectitude, without the slightest self-interest. If the human heart can embody and follow this, acting without partiality and always aligning with perfect rectitude, then one will undoubtedly verify the Great Cavern and the Venerable of the Great Mystery.

Flying to verify the Venerable of the Great Mystery—
Ascending to verify the fruition of the Venerable of the Great Mystery’s position.

Below this, the *Great Cavern* of Mount Mao (alternate version) reads:
*The spirit extricates the accumulated [karma] of the three paths; the immortal embryo entwines the omen of form.*

The two lines above frequently appear, for the Three Perfected of the Great Mystery occupy the most exalted position. Beyond Heaven and Earth lies the realm of *Xuwu* (Vacuity-and-Nothingness), the abode of the Primordial Beginning, styled *Xuwu Ziran* (Vacuous-Natural). It is called *xu* (vacuous) because it is without heart-mind, and *wu* (nothing) because it is utterly empty. Yet vacuity enables it to contain all, and nothingness enables it to transform all. Thus it is called the *Scripture of the Hidden Emperor*. When humans attain vacuity and nothingness, the numinous spirits naturally come; once they come, they remain enduringly luminous. Hence the hexagrams *Kun* (Receptive) and *Gen* (Stillness) are invoked as metaphors for its capacity to contain and endure.

The above Jade Chapter in celestial seal-script comprises one hundred and thirty characters, transmitted from the Heaven of Yu-Yu, governing the Ninth Rampart of the Lord of Flourishing Virtue.

The *Mysterious Contract* states: Upon reaching this stage, one ascends to the rank of Perfected King of the Supreme Clarity and Perfected One of Grand Unity.

The Primordial Heavenly King says: The thirty-fifth Jade Chapter of the Great Cavern of Wenchang elucidates the Dao of the intermingling of the *Kan* (Abysmal) and *Li* (Clinging) trigrams. It arises from the primordial qi of the Sacred Realm of Jade Clarity.

The Three Perfected give birth to Great Nothingness.
The Three Perfected are the Three Qi Heavenly Lords of the Southern Direction, born at the inception of the Vast Emptiness of Great Nothingness. The text below refers to *Nanchang*, which is Wenchang. Today, Mount Heng corresponds to the *Zhen* constellation above and presides over the Southern Palace of *Li* below. It harbors the Grotto-Heaven of Vermilion Mound, the third of the thirty-six grotto-heavens. Only those who refine and transform themselves here are permitted to attain full personhood. Within the human body, this corresponds to the Three Perfected Yuan Lords of Essence and Blood.

Some say the Three Perfected are the same as the Three Perfected of the Great Mystery mentioned earlier; others claim *Taiwu* (Great Nothingness) is a corruption of *Taiyuan* (Great Prime). This is in fact the Jade Chapter of the Great Cavern of the Lord of Great Simplicity within Great Nothingness.

The Jade Gate reflects the morning glow.
The Great Person continues the illumination across the four directions, as night wanes and the sun’s light succeeds it—precisely the moment when the Great Brilliance emerges from the Eastern Direction. The Southern Direction, positioned in the Palace of *Li*, shares its name with the sun. The *Jade Gate* is where the sun-bird’s chariot emerges; *morning* refers to the sun, and its radiance illumines the rosy clouds of dawn—also an allusion to the early court audience. At the summit of Vermilion Sparrow Peak on Mount Southern Prison stands the Sun-Viewing Pavilion. On clear mornings, ascending this pavilion to observe the solar orb’s emergence from the sea reveals its gradual ascent and descent, its hesitation before rising, and then its sudden ascent in a single burst of splendor—all phenomena fully evident here.

The numinous essence of the Grotto of Great Simplicity—
The sun and moon adhere to Heaven, and their radiance must illuminate the Vermilion Heaven’s Grotto-Yang Palace in the Southern Direction. Only those who refine their forms here are permitted to ascend to the Celestial Court.

As stated in the preceding fascicle: *The Three-Flower Qi of Great Simplicity*—the Three-Flower Qi are also the Three Qi of the Southern Direction. Great Simplicity is the Mother of the Three Simplicities, presiding over the work of refinement and deliverance. It is also called *Hanzhang* (Rare and Vast). Mount Heng possesses a blessed site named the Altar of the Grotto-Heaven of Numinous Radiance, among others—all places where superior immortals attain the Dao. Wenchang’s refinement and transformation occur here, which is why this grotto chapter frequently refers to it.

The cinnabar groves flourish with vermilion branches.
The hundred grains and myriad plants adhere to the earth. Because the Southern Direction is associated with the color red, all that grows there are cinnabar groves and vermilion branches. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: *Vermilion and azure, green boughs and jade-like branches.* Medical texts record: *The Southern Mountains abound in numinous mushrooms and auspicious herbs; those who consume them all become immortals.*

Return the spirit to the ninefold palace.
Restore the spirit to the ninefold palace, for the Vermilion Mound’s Fire Palace is formed from the ninefold yang qi of Brahma. Today, the topography of Mount Heng also presents nine fronts and nine backs, corresponding to the yang number. This describes the signs manifesting in the heart’s palace during cultivation.

Nanchang emits jade-like radiance.
Nothing dries and matures the myriad things as thoroughly as fire. Thus, the Southern Direction’s fire virtue augments the Great Yang, adorning all categories of existence so each may fulfill its growth. Nanchang, the Bureau of Refinement, is the place of deliverance—none who attain the Dao fail to pass through it. Named the Grotto-Yang Palace, it contains the Flowing Fire Pool and the Yellow Flower Waters, both of which generate jade-like blossoms of splendor. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: *Those who cultivate and recite this scripture will all receive deliverance and ascend to the Southern Palace*—a parallel to this passage, describing the heart’s palace and spirit’s abode in such magnificence.

Nanchang is Wenchang. The Primordial Beginning refines it with talismanic scriptures and true writings in the Grotto-Yang Palace. Thus it is said: *Within Wenchang resides the deathless spirit, the Lord of Longevity, the True Lords of Life Mandate, Fortune, Lifespan Extension, and Destiny Augmentation.* The *Scripture of Salvation* states: *The Southern Palace and Nanchang are identical to this*—referring to present-day Mount Heng.

The primordial qi ascends to connect with the Fire Star. The Palace of the Scorching Sun is governed by the Venerable Lord of Flame. Within it, the summer qi nurtures and fosters the myriad things. All the gods of the world, on the day of Summer’s Beginning, ascend to this Crimson Stone Jade Tower to pay homage to the Venerable Lord of Flame, receive the Heavenly Mysterious Talismans, and return to their respective directions to enact the summer ordinances.

The Crimson Emperor, Jade Controller Lord, is named Jingdu. If one knows this spirit and contemplates it for nine years, the elixir of longevity will be attained. Cinnabar clouds will fly, descending to welcome the adept’s body, which will then ascend to Jade Clarity.

Though this be so, Mount Heng lies thousands of miles away—how could everyone journey there to behold it? Yet within the human body there is also a Mount Heng. Knowing this, the Bureau of Wenchang’s refinement and transformation is not far off. The Dao is not distant from humanity; it resides within the body. Seek it through personal inquiry and authentic attainment—do not rely on arbitrary conjecture or forced interpretation.

The hundred joints receive the fluid essence.
The world regards water as the moistening element, and thus it is water that engenders and nurtures the myriad things. This perfectly illustrates the *Kan* trigram’s significance.

Humans possess one hundred and eighty numinous joints, three hundred and sixty bones, one thousand two hundred physical forms, twelve thousand essences of radiance, thirty-six thousand root origins, and eighty-four thousand pores. Within these key points, the moistening fluid essence is generated. Without fluid essence, humans wither and perish. Heaven and Earth are sustained by water, and the myriad things are born and completed by it—truly, all is one.

Conceal the mysterious root in the winding vale of the Three Eminences.
Hide the mysterious root within the winding vale of the Three Eminences. Mount Heng is named the Heaven of Lesser Existence within Great Vacuity. An ancient poem states: *Within the Grotto of Lesser Existence grows the Three Eminences herb.*

The lingzhi is precisely this. Mountains bear five sacred fungi, and those who consume the highest of them attain transcendence. The body soars to the Jade Clarity—once one’s own form has verified the rank of Upper Immortal, one may ascend and wander in revelry through the sacred precincts of Jade Clarity, paying court to the Primordial Celestial Sovereign. Many sages of old had kin whose flesh and bone took flight together, yet these physical forms all shed and concealed themselves in famous mountains; only the spirit may depart.

The seven ancestors depart the Dark Gate.
The Dark Gate is the Water Bureau, the winding source of the Yellow Springs. Before one attains the Dao, the seven ancestors remain mired in the Dark Gate; once immortality is achieved, one must first deliver one’s own lineage of ancestors to escape the Dark Gate—this is the Nether Capital governed by the Earth and Water Bureaus.

Eternally preserve beyond the kalpas of termination.
Forever safeguard through the inexhaustible kalpas of dust. The *Great Cavern Scripture* represents the supreme vehicle, far beyond the reach of lesser immortals of inferior rank. Those who cultivate to this stage never regress—how can they be compared with the fruits of celestial beings?

Inherit the immortal lineage for ten thousand generations.
The *Jade Scripture* states: *Generation after generation without end, ever ruling as sovereign; through a thousand myriad kalpas, perpetually succeeding one another.* In the families of Upper Immortals, all the renowned mountains of the world have those of different surnames who inherit the immortal rank. Only the Heavenly Master Zhang’s lineage has endured for forty generations.

The rank is the honored seat of the sagely succession.
Establishing the ultimate principle in accord with Heaven, this rank is the honored seat of the sagely succession. Among humankind, this is the work of the great person—just as the Great Cavern Celestial Honored One governs all spirits, occupying the most exalted and noble position. Few in the world attain this as immortals.

The Jade Clarity Great Cavern Immortal.
The title is *Jade Clarity Great Cavern Spirit*, the most revered and glorious. This is the moment when Kan and Li unite in intercourse and the true body is perfected. There are the Great Cavern Honored One and the Great Cavern Spirit, yet they are fundamentally one—namely, one’s own original destiny and celestial alignment. Fire above and water below possess the Way of intercourse. People merely know that fire flames upward and water moistens downward, yet they do not understand that restraining the heart-fire to ascend the kidney-water is the principle of ceaseless generation. If fire is too parching or water too inundating, death follows. In tranquil serenity, with a single mind and all distractions banished, the purple-golden light transforms, manifesting in the eyes as a sign—this is not achieved through massage or visualization.

The above jade passage of celestial script consists of seventy characters, descended from the Clear Subtlety Heaven and presided over by the Ninth Rampart Lord of Flourishing Virtue. The *Mysterious Contract* states: *At this stage, one ascends to the Jade Clarity Sagely Heaven as the One Sagely Sovereign.*

The Primordial Celestial Sovereign declares: *The thirty-sixth jade passage of the Great Cavern of Wenchang corresponds to the trigram pair Dui and Gen, signifying joy and stillness.*

The boundary of the Maitreya Heaven is transformed by Brahmanic qi.
The Ninefold Numinous Qi of the Western Origin.
This passage corresponds to the trigrams by first taking Dui and then Gen in opposition. Dui is the trigram of the true West, hence the Ninefold Numinous Supreme Wondrous White Jade Tortoise Terrace Golden Perfected Brahmanic Qi Primordial Sovereign—this is the Queen Mother of the West, who governs the female immortals and resides in the highest precincts of the Paradise of Lang. She is formed of the Ninefold Numinous True Qi and has endured for hundreds of millions of years. Those who recite this scripture may pray for the empresses, consorts, and concubines to enjoy longevity equal to the Queen Mother’s and grace matching the years of the Brushing Stone.

The Golden Elixir flows through the Cloud Palace.
The Great Elixir takes gold as its mother. The Cloud Palace enters the Muddy Pellet Palace. The Cloud Palace is also the residence of the Queen Mother. Formerly, Shen Taizhi, styled Guangxiang, was originally from Luoyang. While serving as an official beyond the lakes, his family settled in Changsha. One evening atop the peak of Mount Zhuhong, he encountered a perfected one who transmitted to him the Fire Dragon technique of the Golden Elixir. After years of cultivation, his merit and conduct were complete, enabling him to ride the void and wander as a spirit, appearing and vanishing unpredictably. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang dreamed of him and invited him to serve as National Preceptor. Later, he ascended as a perfected immortal. This is the verification of the Golden Elixir, and thus the *Great Medicinal Elixir Diagram* was established in former times.

Above, it reaches the rotating apex of the luminaries.
The apex is the end, the utmost. The Queen Mother of Kunlun’s Langfeng governs this, for her height equals that of Heaven. Above, it attains the utmost pinnacle of the seven luminaries’ revolving jade mechanism.

Below this passage, according to the *Jade Scripture* of Mount Mao, there are four lines: *Amidst the radiant glory of the great rosy clouds, / Revolving the nine-heavenly wheel, / Serenely sinking the eightfold firm currents, / The chamber holds the Womb Immortal Mother.* These are absent in the Shu edition. For now, they are omitted, awaiting future scholars who may supplement them. Generally, scriptures and registers follow their respective transmitted lineages, and one need not rigidly adhere to uniformity or divergence, nor weigh their abundance or scarcity to seek peculiarity.

Carrying the *jin*, he enters the chamber of the Grand Thearch.
The *jin* of the Great Tenuity is named *Ganjingjing*, also called *Three Jin Intercourse*, and is also known as the *Jin* Child. It is the celestial robe. Lifting the celestial robe, one ascends to the chamber of the Grand Thearch. This is the Great Tenuity Grand Thearch, also one of the nine souls’ names—namely, the Central Yellow Court.

The Mysterious One’s numinous time gives birth.
The Mysterious One, Laozi Lin Xufu, styled *Lingshi*, guided the Dao to convey the mysterious qi, enabling numinous transformation and change.

The *Knot Scripture* states: *First is the conveyance of qi—this is the qi of the Great Mystery. It is precious to cause the nasal breath’s mysterious qi to congeal and settle.*

The Three Elders rarely display their forms.
The Three Primordial Elders are named *Hanzhang*. In the second chapter of the upper scroll, it states: *The Three Primordials give birth to the Muddy Pellet; the Elder Lord Hanzhang ascends above.* This is of the same meaning. The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: *The Three Elders sit together, each with their companions.* This also shares the same meaning as the Three Elders of the court.

On the left, he grasps the registers of the Five Talismans.
It speaks of the Three Primordial Elders. On the left, they hold the divine writs, talismans, charts, and registers of the Five Numinous Ones and Five Elders, as well as the incantations and mandates that rebuke inauspiciousness and open the Yellow Path. All perfected ones who wander in revelry and immortals who have attained the Dao rely on the Five Elders to initiate their journey.

On the right, he carries the lineage of the ten thousand spirits.
Dui signifies joy—accord with Heaven and response to humankind. The former people faced hardship, yet the people forgot their toil and death. This is the ultimate principle of humanity. When a person attains the Dao, left and right are raised and supported, and the ten thousand spirits all return to one’s grasp, ready to be commanded at will.

Together, they ascend the Dragon-Gem Gate.
The *Book of Changes* states: *The six positions are timely and accomplished; riding the six dragons, one governs Heaven.*

The *Great Cavern Scripture* here calls this the "Six Perfections Fully Realized," where together with the multitudes, one ascends the palaces of Dragon and Phoenix, of gem and jade—this is called "Selecting Immortals and Promoting Adepts." Bowing one’s head to the Jade Clarity Chamber. At the Upper Prime Mud-Pill Palace, cultivation having reached this stage, the Golden Elixir is already formed. One ought to shed the womb and change the cauldron, the spirit transforming naturally. Bowing one’s head, one pays homage and audience to the King of Clarity ● and the Primordial Beginning within the Cavern Chamber, requesting to receive immortal ranks and fill the offices of immortals.

One attains the Most Revered in the Sacred,
verifying the rank of the Great Cavern Heaven’s First Emperor Revered—this is the most exalted position in the sacred realm, forever immune to decline. Such is the station of the Golden Portal’s attending ministers before the Three Supreme Realms, a state incomparable to the conditioned causes of the Three Realms.

The talisman transforms into the Sovereign of Mysterious Qi.
Gen signifies "stillness"—stillness at the place of utmost goodness and ultimate perfection. The tradition states: *The workings of Highest Heaven are soundless and scentless.* When a person’s cultivation reaches this point, all dust is shaken off and exhausted, returning to the ○ Limitless.

The talisman is the Yin Talisman, refined by the yang fire’s minute transformation into Mysterious Qi, verifying one’s rank in the Jade Clarity. First, essence and qi nurture the spirit, forming the Infant; then the Infant is refined into the Yang Talisman, and the talisman transforms into Mysterious Qi—this is what is meant by ascending into formlessness and uniting with the Dao in truth.

The Śākya tradition states: *All phenomena with form are illusory.* It also says: *The Tathāgata cannot be seen through a fully embodied form.* And further: *If one seeks me through form or sound, that person walks the deviant path and cannot see the Tathāgata.* The Tathāgata is the self; if obscured by sound and form, one cannot perceive the original true Buddha. Generally, this scripture aims at knowing destiny and seeing nature as the ultimate attainment—its essence lies in steadfast practice.

The above Jade Inscription of Heavenly Seal comprises sixty characters, descending from the Míluó Heaven to govern the Ninth Rampart’s Lord of Flourishing Virtue.

*The Mysterious Covenant* states: When the Dao is perfected, one ascends to the rank of Sacred Venerable. The form transforms into cloud talismans, the talismans disperse into Mysterious Qi, the qi gathers into true form, and the qi conceals itself as true qi. Gazing upon it, one sees the Jade Talisman; listening, one hears the Jade Tone. It is inconceivable, its merit vast and profound—visible yet unseen, audible yet unheard, tangible yet unattainable. Such is the profound and ultimate Daoist lineage, the *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture*, which here attains great penetration.

**Conclusion of the Scripture**

The Jade Palace Dao Lord said: My master, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, bestowed upon me this *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture*, its purport profoundly mysterious.

The Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy said: My master, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, bestowed upon me this *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture*, its purport profoundly mysterious. The Numinous Treasure especially emphasizes its mystery—how could it be easily known? Without dual cultivation of inner and outer, without natural concentration and stillness, and without unobstructed insight, how could one explore its depths, probe its secrets, and reach its farthest truths? This scripture conceals the hidden truths of celestial perfected beings, shared alike by gods and humans.

**The Wondrous Gate of Daoist Cultivation:**

The wondrous practice of Daoist cultivation begins with upholding precepts, then proceeds to meditation. Once precepts and meditation are established, one practices qi to gather spirit and brightness. When breath is stilled and qi congealed, spirit and brightness naturally arrive. With their arrival, wisdom-light arises—this is the ultimate attainment.

**Initial Meditation and Breath Unification**
*The Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* states: *Unobstructed pure wisdom arises from meditative concentration.* If one is not still and settled, how can wisdom-light shine forth? *The Lotus Sutra* says: *In a secluded place, gather the mind and dwell unmoving like Mount Sumeru.* It also says: *When the waters of meditation are clear, the pearl of the mind appears of itself.* The ancients said: *To seek the pearl, the waves must be still—stirring the water makes retrieval difficult.* Thus, meditation and concentration.

The Confucians say: *Only after stillness can there be concentration; only after concentration can there be contemplation.* The heart must be still to concentrate, then to contemplate. These three teachings converge in principle.

**Embryonic Breathing Method**
Eat sparingly, speak little, silently count within the mind, and focus on the breath at the nostrils. A thousand breaths of Great Harmony—if a single thought stirs, it cannot be called Great Harmony. Disharmony breeds other afflictions. Only when not a single thought moves can it be called harmony. Count the breaths to a thousand for one cycle; a thousand cycles complete the Great Harmony.

**Inner Observation and True Transformation**
Within inner observation, one can transform one’s true self—ascending to heaven, descending to earth, coming and going without end. "Inner observation" means internal vision. When merit and practice are complete, one can inwardly perceive the five viscera and outwardly gather the ten thousand spirits, enabling transformation.

**Detachment from Phenomena and Dissolution of Dust**
This body has no relation to the other; the other is the other, the self is the self—this is what is meant by departing from all extremes. The Śākya tradition states: *If one fills three thousand great thousand-worlds with the seven treasures to offer in charity, it does not compare to upholding this scripture, even four lines of verse—this merit surpasses the former.* According to *The Diamond Sutra*, there are two four-line verses: the first says, *If one seeks me through form...*; the latter says: *All conditioned phenomena are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, like dew and lightning—thus should they be contemplated.*

*Laozi* says: *The greatest image is formless.* And: *The great Dao is formless.* Confucius said: *The spirit has no direction, change has no form—silent and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating.* Carefully examining the teachings of the three sages, though their methods differ, their essence is one.

This scripture is this mind. If one thoroughly investigates its four-line verse, this body is but an illusory aggregation of conditioned phenomena, all empty constructs. If one pursues this path to perceive the original source, one must let go of both ends and engage in a fierce battle on the precipice. Only when the root of life is suddenly severed is one truly home—this is what is meant by detachment from phenomena and dissolution of dust.

The ancients said: *The body of the ten thousand phenomena does not cling to a single thread.* Truly, these words are apt.

**Five Thousand Cycles of Primordial Union**
Gather the Great Harmony to complete five thousand cycles. Though the number is vast, it begins with one—like grinding a brick into a mirror or sharpening a pestle into a needle. Only here does one see the work accomplished, complete and lacking nothing. As the saying goes: *Without sufficient effort, the elixir will not form.*

**Sitting in Stillness, Standing in Oblivion**
Sitting, there is existence; standing, there is none—returning to the boundless, the indistinct, the soundless, the scentless, the thoughtless, the effortless. Where are voices and laughter to be found? The *Daoist Scripture* says: *Sitting in liberation, standing in oblivion*—like the monk Pǔhuà, who shook his bell and ascended to heaven.

**Great Concentration and Complete Perfection**
When the heart’s qi is in great concentration, never wavering, there is no disturbance from hunger, thirst, cold, or heat. Weapons cannot harm, venomous creatures cannot sting, water cannot drown, fire cannot burn. Sight does not see, hearing does not hear, what is near is not perceived before, what follows is not seen behind. Only then is it called *sitting in stillness, standing in oblivion, great concentration, and complete perfection*. Even heaven and earth, ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it. To this day, many ancient worthies in the world sit in meditation without wishing to emerge from concentration—such as Dīshuǐ of Jìnyún in Shu and Pǔ’ān of the Fourth Patriarch in Jiangnan, who were seen in the world yet dwelled in the Dao. This is great concentration and complete perfection.

**Marvelous Practice and Spiritual Penetration**

Marvelous Practice refers to the *Ten Immortals and Ten Gates* of the upper scroll, the *Ten Caverns and Ten Roots* of the middle scroll, and the *Ten Flower-Contemplation Gates* of the lower scroll, along with the wondrous fruits of the *Eight Trigrams and Six Positions*—all termed the *Great Cavern Marvelous Practice*. Spiritual Penetration arises when Marvelous Practice is cultivated to perfection, naturally attaining profound spiritual communion.

First is *Penetration of Qi*. At the outset, one learns *embryonic breathing*, regulating the inhalation and exhalation of qi until their count is known. When the breath is held for 1,200 cycles, this is called *Great Embryonic Breathing*. The method of Great Embryonic Breathing by the ancient Ge Zhichuan corresponds to the *Sūrangama Sūtra*’s *discernment of thought-counting*.

Next is *Penetration of Spirit*. When one’s primordial spirit merges with the myriad spirits and true qi harmonizes, the spirit’s transformations become unfathomable. This does not mean communing with external spirits—such are demonic illusions that corrupt virtue and must never be engaged. Let them depart of their own accord.

Finally is *Penetration of Spirit*. Master Cheng Yi of Luoyang, in his commentary on the *Doctrine of the Mean*, speaks of *foreknowledge*: "Even figures like Dong Wujing of Shu Mountain possess it, yet this is but a minor attainment. At its utmost, a single point of numinous clarity becomes as limpid as a mirror, reflecting the workings of heaven and earth, the auspicious and inauspicious, regret and remorse—all manifest within it. Good and evil are known in advance, for this is the *Way of Utmost Sincerity* in the *Doctrine of the Mean*, what the Buddhist scriptures call *liberated knowledge and vision*, and what the Confucian classics describe as *the extension of knowledge through the investigation of things*."

Its beauty resides within, yet flows through the four limbs, manifesting in one’s undertakings. All arises from the self’s spirit and qi attaining spiritual penetration—nothing comes from without.

**The Ten Penetrations Culminate in Perfection**

In a former dream, I was gored by an ox—this was none other than my own original destiny-star. Master Weishan said: "Dwelling at Weishan for twenty years, I have tended but a single water-buffalo. If it strays into the grass, I lead it out; if it tramples the crops, I strike it. Now, I see it clearly in the open, and though I chase it, it does not flee." For over thirty years, I too have guarded the pen, and only now have I glimpsed the ox. The labor was not easy. From the initial stabilization of breath to the perfection of the Ten Penetrations, no stage may be neglected. When one is penetrated, all are penetrated. Ghosts and spirits possess the Five Penetrations; buddhas possess the Six Penetrations; celestial immortals possess the Ten Penetrations.

**The Dao Complete, Ascending to the Celestial Court**

When merit is fulfilled and the Dao complete, one ascends to the Purple Court, sheds the mortal frame, and the true spirit soars aloft. Though the ancients spoke of *ascending with one’s dwelling*—flesh and bone together—such impure, turbid forms cannot appear before the Emperor. They must be concealed in famous mountains or cast into distant seas. Only the singular true spirit, riding qi in flight, may traverse the Three Realms and ascend to the Jade Capital. The Buddhist teaching that *the fully endowed physical body cannot behold the Tathāgata* expresses the same principle—like the Dark Emperor concealing his golden bones on Mount Wudang.

**Traversing the Three Realms, Wandering the Three Clarities**

The Three Clarities lie above the Three Realms, within the boundless *Daluo Heaven*. Though lofty, they may be traversed. Those who cultivate the *Great Cavern* transcend the Three Realms entirely.

**Attaining the Rank of the Great Cavern, the Celestial Sovereign of Heavenly Unity**

The Celestial Sovereign of the Great Cavern presides above all heavens, the rank to which the adept ascends. *Heavenly Unity* is the *Great Mystery*, the realm attainable by the highest immortals and perfected beings.

**The Six Perfections and Ten Penetrations, Myriad Practices Perfected**

The Six Perfections and myriad practices, the Six Positions and Ten Penetrations, are brought to perfect completion, flawless and whole. Each barrier and ford must be broken through one by one before true suchness is revealed.

**A Thousand Harmonies, Ten Thousand Unions—Naturally Attaining Perfection**

The *Scripture of Salvation* states: "The Dao of *revolving wind and blending union* values harmony above all. If one can achieve a thousand harmonies and ten thousand unions, the Dao of true immortality is naturally attained."

In the preceding three ranks, "true" denotes *sincerity without falsehood*. If one can *turn inward and be sincere*, there is no greater joy. For what is bestowed upon humanity is the *heavenly perfection of complete virtue*. Yet as years advance, it is obscured by worldly desires, the original source eroded, like flowing water rushing ever onward without return. Thus, the Primordial Heavenly King, the Jade Court Dao Lord, and the Great Mystery Dao Father—the Three Masters, father and sons—awakened good causes and established this dialogue to deliver beings.

Yet this scripture embodies the profound mysteries of the Three Treasures, its principles subtle and recondite, difficult to fathom. I have ventured, in the course of its verses, to append my humble insights, unworthy though they be. Drawing from a lifetime of learning—transmitted heart-to-heart and mouth-to-mouth—I have appended them here. Though the text’s expressions vary, now direct, now circuitous, revealing both nature and destiny, its great principle may be summed in six words: *settle heavenly principle, guard one’s fundamental duty*.

Some may say: "To reveal secret teachings is a grave transgression." I reply: "I would rather accept the consequences, for my wish is that beneath the round canopy of heaven, within the four seas, all who see or hear may cultivate and realize the *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture of Wenchang*, thereby above aiding the sage’s boundless longevity, continuing the legacy of Yao, Shun, the Yellow Emperor, and Xuanyuan; and below blessing the common people across the eight wilds, transforming all lands into realms of Yu, Ji, Yan, and Zeng. May all people share in virtue, and all things partake in benevolence—this is my aspiration. What should I fear?"

I, Qi, bow twice and respectfully inscribe this.

The *Mysterious Concordance* states: "The *Great Cavern Immortal Scripture* was expounded by the Primordial Heavenly King for the Jade Court Dao Lord, revealing the primordial, unfolding the ultimate, and bridging the celestial and human, that all might attain immortality. It is the true essential text. When scholars recite it, they awaken and ascend as immortals; when ghosts and spirits recite it, they awaken and ascend as perfected beings; when ordinary people recite it, they awaken and attain longevity; when wandering souls hear it, their souls and spirits revive, forever escaping mortal peril and ascending to heaven. The withered, aged, and infirm who hear it extend their years; infants and divine youths who hear it gain wisdom. Superior adepts who obtain it ascend to the Jade Clarity, attain the rank of sage, and unite with the Dao."
