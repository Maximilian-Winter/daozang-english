**Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing* with Commentaries**

**Title:** *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Fu Jing with Commentaries*
Original attribution: Composed by the Ten True Persons, including赤松子 and others. According to *Daozang Ti Yao*, this is a spurious work falsely attributed to Southern Song and Jin-Yuan Daoists. Three scrolls.
Source: *Zhengtong Daozang*, *Dongzhen* section, *Yujue* category.

**Volume One: Commentaries by the Ten True Persons**
赤松子, 张良 (Zifang True Person), 太极左仙 (Taiji Left Immortal), 翁葛玄 (Weng Ge Xuan), 许逊 (Xishan True Person), 钟离权 (Zhengyang True Person), 吕洞宾 (Pure Yang True Person), 华阳真人, 施肩吾, 崔明公 (Zhi Yi True Person), 刘玄英 (Hai Can True Person), 曹道冲 (Qingxu True Person).

钟离权 said:
*"Huang"* is the central color, *"Di"* the sovereign’s title.
Centrality governs the Five Phases; sovereignty rules all things.
*"Yin"* is the root of nature, *"Fu"* the foundation of fate—this is the essence of the *Yin Fu*.

Within, it cultivates the self; without, it governs the family and state.
It encompasses Heaven and Earth, commands all directions.
All ancient and modern Daoists who attained the Way did so through this principle, reaching *wuwei* (non-action).

张子房’s praise:
*"Know that Heaven’s Five is Central Yellow,
The Sovereign’s Primordial Law—Central King.
The Immortals all grasp the *Yin Fu*’s logic,
Govern the state, cultivate the self, and enter the Sage’s realm."*

曹道冲’s *Qingxiao Le*:
*"The heart is the sovereign’s image—Central Yellow,
The spirit’s impartial use brings the Dao’s flourishing.
Yin is the nature’s root—lead is precious,
Recorded as Heaven’s treasure, the fate’s *Fu* is Yang.
The scripture spreads teachings, opening expedients,
Universal salvation for the lost—great voyage.
Wait only for success to be fulfilled,
The Ten Isles’ Immortal Lands are home."*

**The Immortals Embrace Unity in Daoist Practice**
吕洞宾 said:
*"Heaven One generates Water, Earth Two generates Fire—
In man, this is *jing* (essence).
The spirit is born of the Dao, the form of *jing*.
Guard it and do not lose it—united with the Mysterious,
Then spirit and essence merge yet remain distinct.
Gather essence to refine the spirit,
Use the spirit to govern *qi*,
Refine the spirit to merge with the Dao—
Thus, with Heaven, endure eternally.
Hence the *Dao De Jing* says:
‘Embrace Unity—how could it depart?’
And again:
‘Embrace Unity as the model for all under Heaven.’
Long ago, Guangchengzi admonished the Yellow Emperor:
‘Do not exhaust your form, do not agitate your essence,
Few desires and little thought—thus longevity is attained.’
This is the essence of the Immortals’ embrace of Unity."*

葛仙翁’s praise:
*"From the Primordial Yellow’s chaos, life begins,
Supporting transformation, establishing Heaven and Earth.
Seekers of longevity must find the Dao—
Taiyi’s True One is the True One itself."*
崔明公’s *Linjiang Xian*:
*"The vital *qi*’s root is fate’s ancestor,
Focused embrace of the Mysterious True.
In the dim void, the Original Essence hides,
The Perfect Man first attends to the root—
Root established, the Dao’s foundation set.
Pearls hidden in shells, jade in stone—
Earth and Heaven endure eternally—
All from cherishing *Dao* and *De*,
Transcending kalpas in serene peace.
Observe Heaven’s Way, follow Heaven’s actions—
Thus all is complete.
Hence it is said:
‘Observe Heaven’s Way, hold fast to Heaven’s actions—
Thus all is complete.’"*

赤松子’s praise:
*"Heaven’s Way is wordless, governing the Four Seasons,
Clouds move, rain falls—all things depend on it.
Piercing the Mysterious Symbols, following Heaven’s decrees,
Body this, cultivate the True—align with the Sage’s intent."*

刘海蟾’s *Tingqian Liu*:
*"Heaven’s Way is the Primordial Yang,
Its canopy is without bias, the stars suspended bright.
At Winter Solstice, Yang rises from Earth,
At Summer Solstice, the fluid descends to Heaven.
The Rabbit and Tortoise’s essences circulate,
Thus the revolving *Xuan* (celestial pivot) moves.
Observe the Dao, name the four seasons and eight nodes—
Study them deeply.
Daily actions mirror a year.
Advance the fire at midnight,
At times add mercury, extract lead,
Refine the Golden Elixir—
Then you are called an Immortal."*

**Heaven’s Five Thieves**
赤松子 said:
*"The Five Thieves are the Five Phases.
In Heaven, they are the Five Stars; in man, the Five Viscera.
To the eyes, they are the Five Colors;
To the ears, the Five Sounds;
To the nose, the Five Fragrances;
To the tongue, the Five Tastes;
To the body, the Five Touches;
To the heart, the Five Poisons—
All are called the Five Thieves.
Thief means harm.
These Five Phases’ *qi* each harbor life and death."*

The Way aligns—auspicious; it reverses—disastrous.
When Heaven’s timing aligns, the four seasons harmonize in tranquility and abundance.
When reversed, wars, famines, floods, droughts, locusts, and epidemics bring calamity.
Man’s Five Thieves lie only in the heart.
A rectified heart is gentle, compassionate, and pure—its deeds bring fortune;
A disordered heart is harsh, cruel, licentious, and turbid—its deeds bring misfortune.
*"Seeing"* means awakening.
Awakening and clarity bring well-being to body and mind.
Thus it is said: *Heaven’s Five Thieves*—those who perceive them flourish.

**Liu Haichan’s Ode:**
The Five Thieves rampage across the ten thousand realms—
Wood, Metal, Water, Fire, and the Central Phase.
Severing warhorses and banishing demonic chaos,
Perceiving them brings eternal peace to all under Heaven.

**Cui Minggong’s *Sumu Zhe*:**
The Five Thieves’ schemes are formless, shadowless—
They torment the common folk, devouring each generation.
When one organ weakens, another prevails;
Exhausting the body, it stems from excess yin.
When the Spleen thrives, nourish the Kidneys—
Greed, delusion, deceit, and jealousy all vanish.
Seeing all as empty, the Five Aggregates dissolve—
Life and nature endure, firm as Heaven’s permanence.

The Five Thieves reside in the heart, manifesting in Heaven.
**Zifang** said:
The Five Thieves are: *thieves of life, of possessions, of merit, of timing, of spirit*.
These Five Thieves dwell in the heart, unseen yet advancing.
Awakening and comprehending them is called *illuminating the natural*.
When the spirit is steadied and qi harmonized, free of obstruction,
Actions align with cosmic patterns—just as Heaven operates.
The universe lies within the grasp; ten thousand transformations arise from the body.

**Liu Haichan** said:
First observe Heaven’s Dao, then clarify the Five Thieves,
Acting in accordance with Heaven’s command.
Though vast as the cosmos, it does not escape the palm;
Though myriad transformations exist, they all originate in the body.

**Lü Zhenren’s Ode:**
The heart-mirror, clear and luminous—
Actions and deeds align with Heaven’s stars.
Just and yielding, the cosmos rests in the hand;
Ten thousand transformations spring from the body alone.

**Shi Zhenren’s *Bu Suanzhi*:**
The heart-mirror, clear and luminous—
The Five Thieves all vanish.
When Heaven’s Dao moves, act accordingly—
Preserve life as Heaven’s permanence.
The cosmos’ pivot lies in the grasp—
Cultivate virtue, steadfast and refined.
Ten thousand transformations arise from the body—
Embrace Oneness, the sacred function.

Heaven’s nature is humanity.
Human heart is the mechanism.
Establish Heaven’s Dao to govern humanity.
**Cui Minggong** said:
Heaven’s nature and human heart originate from the same source.
Heaven’s Dao is boundless void—
Serene, it permeates the human heart.
Their source is identical:
Using Heaven’s nature to illuminate the human heart,
Guiding the human heart to harmonize with Heaven’s mechanisms.
To establish Heaven’s Dao is to uphold *yin-yang*.
To establish humanity’s Dao is to practice *ren and yi*.
*Ren, yi, loyalty, and trustworthiness*—
Exhaustlessly doing good—this is called *Heaven’s noble title*.
First cultivate Heaven’s noble title to accumulate deeds,
Then embody Heaven’s Dao to amass merit.
The most refined merit is *embracing Oneness*.

**Zifang** said:
The Classic speaks of *Heaven’s nature*—humanity;
*The human heart*—the mechanism.
Yet it does not say *human heart is Heaven*,
For all things emerge from the mechanism and return to the mechanism.

**Xu Zhenren’s Ode:**
The Sovereign’s nature transforms and gives birth to humanity—
Heaven’s nature and human heart share one luminous essence.
Good deeds bear perfect fruit—
Southern Palace’s ranks bestow the title of Immortal.

**Ge Xianweng’s *Xijiang Yue*:**
The Great Dao is formless, without attributes—
It generates Heaven, Earth, and humanity.
Human heart and Heaven’s nature share the same essence—
Serene and effortless, the true foundation.
The superior sage embodies Heaven’s Dao—
When the Dao is complete, what fear of dawn and dusk?
Perfect merit brings auspicious fulfillment—
The Seven Ancestors ascend to the wondrous realm.

When Heaven unleashes killing intent, dragons and serpents rise from the earth.
When humanity unleashes killing intent, Heaven and Earth revolt.
**Zifang** said:
Heaven’s killing and generating mechanisms all align with their intent—
Not arbitrary action.
*"Killing"* means following yin with yang;
*"Mechanism"* means adapting to the season.
At the Spring Equinox, the four yangs flourish,
The two yins weaken—
Heaven’s Dao issues commands: thunder roars,
Its voice shakes the abyss, awakening all things,
Forcing dragons and serpents, and all hidden creatures,
To rise from the earth—this is Heaven’s killing intent.
The foolish, unaware of Heaven’s Dao,
Unleash reckless schemes—
Greedy for gain, ambitious for fame,
They topple others, harming all—
Then Heaven’s retribution brings disasters, calamities, and chaos upon them.
This is called *Heaven and Earth’s reversal*.

**Liu Haichan** said:
From *Heaven’s nature is humanity* to *governing humanity*—
This is the Dao’s constancy;
From *Heaven’s killing intent* to *Heaven and Earth’s reversal*—
This is the Dao’s transformation.
The constant upholds *just and yielding* to establish order;
The transformative adapts *yin-yang* to the seasons.

**Shi Zhenren’s Ode:**
Thunder’s voice stirs Heaven’s might—
It startles dragons and serpents, awakening all.
This is the profound mechanism of true transformation—
To master this Dao is to unite with *Xiqí*.

**Xu Zhenren’s Ode:**
When humanity unleashes reckless schemes, calamity arises—
Tipping nations into ruin, families into peril.
Those who mourn lost kingdoms and homes—
Even the Jin Valley and Zhanghua Palace remain unaware.

**Lü Zhenren’s *Linjiang Xian*:**
The gnomon’s shadow shifts with the seasons,
The four yangs command the Spring Equinox.
Heaven’s might thunders with lightning—
Dragons and serpents all rise from the earth,
Hidden creatures awaken in alarm.

The lowly scholar knows not Heaven’s Dao’s intent,
Yet schemes wildly for profit and gain.
He digs pits for others, harms life and things—
His misfortunes cannot be undone,
His ruin comes from his own reckless tilt.

When Heaven and humanity act in unison,
All transformations rest upon a fixed foundation.

Xu Zhenren says:
Heaven gains *Oneness* to attain clarity,
Humanity gains *Oneness* to attain life.
Heaven and humanity employ the same mechanism—
Creation’s work knows no difference.
Thus it is said: *Heaven and humanity act in unison*,
For this is to grasp the Dao’s mechanism.
To harmonize with Heaven,
All dusty entanglements cease within the heart.
Thus it is said: *All transformations rest upon a fixed foundation*.

Nature has skill and clumsiness—
Both can be concealed and hidden.
Cao Daochong says:
No skill surpasses Creation’s art,
Yet none know its purpose—
Is this not like clumsiness?
The Classic says:
*Nature has skill and clumsiness—*
*Both can be concealed and hidden*.
*Laozi* says:
*The greatest skill appears clumsy*.
This meaning aligns with it.

Shi Zhenren says:
Only the Sage sets the mechanism in motion,
Aligned with Heaven’s Dao,
And naturally all transformations rest within the heart’s foundation.
Thus, to exhaust principles and perfect nature,
To unite with the True Dao.
Hence:
*Square yet not rigid, sharp yet not piercing;*
*Straight yet not harsh, bright yet not dazzling;*
*Without praise nor blame, without affirmation nor negation;*
*One dragon, one serpent—transforming with the times;*
*One ascends, one descends—harmony as measure.*
Moving above all things,
Roaming in the Dao’s realm,
How then could one be bound?
It is the return to the root, the restoration of essence.
Thus, *nature has skill and clumsiness—*
*Both can be concealed and hidden*.

Zhongli Zhenren’s Ode:
Heaven and humanity act in unison—
The heart’s foundation is fixed.
Restore essence, return to root—
Perfect nature in its time.
Conceal traces, hide brilliance—
Cultivate virtue and power.
Conceal the primal fire,
Guard the yielding female.

Lü Zhenren’s *Wangjiangnan*:
Heaven’s Dao is profound,
Creation moves through the four seasons.
Sometimes leaping in the depths at the Month of Mao,
Or safely withdrawn—
The autumn equinox’s omen is clear.
The celestial symbols are manifest.
Humanity embodies this,
Acting in unison with Heaven’s stars.
Daily life follows the hexagram’s lines,
The water clock’s markings—
All entanglements vanish,
The mind at rest.

When the merit is complete, one ascends to Penglai.
The nine orifices’ evils lie in the three gates,
Which govern movement and stillness.
Ge Xianweng says:
*The three gates are eye, ear, and mouth*.
If movement and stillness are not lost to their time,
The Dao shines bright.
Thus it is said:
*What is not proper, do not gaze upon;*
*What is not proper, do not listen to;*
*What is not proper, do not speak of*.
*The Five Thousand Words* say:
*The five colors blind the eyes,*
*The five sounds deafen the ears,*
*The five flavors dull the tongue*.
Sight and hearing, speech—
These precede all human action.
Thus, among the nine orifices,
The three gates are paramount.
These three can nourish or harm humanity.
Nourishment comes from stillness,
Harm from movement.
Movement is human contrivance,
Stillness is Heaven’s essence.
Human contrivance is false,
Heaven’s essence is true.

Zhang Zifang’s Ode:
Nine-orifice winds assail the upright spirit,
The three gates sealed—True Essence preserved.
Clarify the heart, dispel desires to seek profound truth,
Awakening earnestness—no fixed path remains.

Ge Xianweng’s *Yujia’ao*:
Mysteries profound, profound yet deeper still,
The Sage’s laws descend to guide.
Embodying the Dao, observing Heaven—
All is revealed.
Master the three gates—
Hearing evil, do not let it intrude.
Seal the *Dui* gate, guard the inner treasure,
Colors, sounds, and flavors—all understood.
Sight, hearing, speech all align with the Sage’s path,
Abandon artifice,
Move and rest with the times—then know what is good.
Fire arises from wood,
Disaster strikes when it is checked.
Delusion arises in the state,
When its time comes, it collapses.
To know this and refine—
This is the Sage.

Shi Zhenren says:
The above speaks of the nine evils, the three gates,
And the proper balance of movement and stillness—
Urging caution, lest one fail to exhaust principles and perfect nature.
Thus, the analogy of fire and wood, delusion and state,
Is raised again to earnestly urge refinement.

Human nature’s passions,
Like fire within wood—
Emerging from nature yet harming it,
Fire arising from wood yet destroying it.
Only the Sage comprehends the source of nature and life,
Clarifies Heaven and humanity’s Dao,
Externally refines the form,
Internally cultivates the nature.
Refining the form preserves essence,
Cultivating the nature nourishes spirit.
Thus, the True Dao suffices to govern the body’s threads,
Suffices to govern the state’s lands,
Suffices to govern the world.
Thus, refining for oneself—
Its virtue is true;
Refining for the family—
Its virtue is abundant;
Refining for the world—
Its virtue is enduring;
Refining for the state—
Its virtue is universal.
From the inner to the outer,
From the near to the far,
Cultivating this profound wind—
It reaches everywhere.
Thus it is said:
*To know this and refine—*
*This is the Sage*.

Cao Zhenren’s Ode:
Wood is true nature, fire is passion—
When desire’s fire rages, it obstructs true nature.
Only the Sage, through refinement, attains this:
The state knows no peril, wood suffers no burning.

Xu Zhenren’s Ode:
On the day the Yellow Emperor attained the Dao,
He revealed the path to enlightenment.
The state’s wood is true nature,
Delusion’s fire is evil passion.
When passion vanishes, the fire is extinguished,
When nature awakens, passion dies.
If the ruler refines earnestly,
Body and state both rest in peace.

Ge Xianweng’s *Mantingfang*:
When the heart stirs, the spirit grows weary;
When passion clears, nature finds ease—
The wondrous gate opens, the mystic pass revealed.
Fire arises from wood—
Disaster looms; investigate carefully.
Water holds ice yet hinders water,
Fields store brambles yet obstruct the fields—
Profound teachings are idle,
Evil and true are but illusions,
Joy comes from carefree observation.
Heaven’s light reveals it:
The five aggregates—
Refinement knows their end.
What in the world is difficult to dispel?
Demons vanish entirely,
Returning to the origin, completing *Dui* to *Qian*.
The deed is done, cause and effect complete.
Seeking Truth, the Three Thousand Practices fulfilled—
Dan is achieved, transcendence attained.

*The Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing Jijie* concludes.

**The *Fuguo Anmin* Chapter of the Daoist Teachings:**

Zhongli Zhenren says:
*"Fuguo"* (wealth of the realm) is the name for sufficiency;
*"Anmin"* (peace of the people) means ease and tranquility.
The body is like a family and a state,
The heart compares to the sovereign and the father.
When the sovereign upholds virtue, all under Heaven finds universal peace;
When the heart remains still, all spirits within flourish abundantly.

Within one’s self, the vital essence suffices for all things,
The refined *qi* nourishes blood and vessels,
The organs, soul, and spirit—
Skin, hair, and flesh—
Are akin to the myriad commoners.

When the ruler has no affairs, the people prosper in ease;
When one knows contentment and forgets greed,
This is called *true wealth*.
Thus the *Daode Jing* states:
*"He who knows contentment is rich."*

It further asks:
*"To love the people and govern the state—
Can one truly do without action?"*

And declares:
*"To act without action, then nothing remains untamed.
I do without action, yet the people transform themselves;
I love stillness, yet the people align with virtue;
I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity;
I engage in no affairs, yet the people attain true wealth.*
This is the essence of the Dao for peace and prosperity."

Zhang Zifang’s hymn reads:
*"The lofty and mysterious Daoist realm is called the Jade Capital,
A treasure without bounds within the *huqiu* (cauldron-vessel) of Heaven and Earth.
To observe contentment without effort is Heaven’s wealth,
To govern with clarity brings harmony and the state’s eternal peace."*

Shizhen Zhenren’s *Yutang Chun* states:
*"The gardens of Langyuan and Penglai,
The realms of Huaxu and all wondrous places,
The Jade Hall, the Golden Horse, and the precious city—
The commoners of Huaxian dwell in perfect peace.
This profound Dao resides within the body alone.
The body compares to a state, the heart to its sovereign."*

The reverent father’s heart upright and without deceit,
Spirit serene and content, knowing sufficiency and forgetting greed—
This is called true abundance and prosperity,
A spring within the cauldron-vessel yet unseen.

Life and death by Heaven’s decree,
The Dao’s principle it is.
The Vermilion Pine Child spoke:
*"Heaven’s birth and death all align with Dao’s workings,
Not arbitrary motion, but the Way’s own order."*

Indeed, Heaven and Earth refine their essence into yin and yang,
Yin and yang condense their essence into the Four Seasons,
The Four Seasons disperse their essence into all things.
Heaven possesses the *qi* of the Five Phases,
Following the seasons, responding to commands,
Shifting in sequence as they unfold.

In spring and summer, the yang-harmonizing *qi* nurtures all things,
In autumn and winter, the yin-cooling *qi* prunes and slays all things—
These are the natural principles, the most equitable of Dharma.

Thus it is said:
*"Life and death by Heaven’s decree,
The Dao’s principle it is."*

Heaven and Earth are thieves of all things,
All things are thieves of humankind,
Humankind are thieves of all things.
If the three thievings are harmonized,
Then the Three Powers are at peace.

The Azure Sea Crane said:
*"Heaven and Earth steal from all things to give them birth,
Yet do not know that Heaven and Earth are stolen from in return,
As all things age and decline.
All things serve humankind for clothing and use,
Yet do not know that they steal humankind’s pride and excess.
Humankind use all things for tools and craft,
Yet do not know that they steal all things to ruin and decay."*

The Xu Zhenren said:
*"All things steal from Heaven and Earth to take form,
Yet do not know that Heaven and Earth steal from all things,
Causing them to wither and grow old.
Humankind steal from all things to gather wealth,
Yet do not know that all things steal from humankind,
Exhausting them with labor and bringing misfortune.
If one steals yet denies the Dao’s way,
This is not true thieving."*

The above three meanings,
Each steals from the other in turn—
The natural principle it is.
If humankind exhaust the principle and grasp the truth,
They align with the Dao’s thieving,
Follow what is fitting and find harmony,
Go against the principle and meet disaster.

Thus the three thievings each find their fitting place,
The Three Powers all rest in their proper roles.
Hence it is said:
*"Eat in season, and the hundred bones are at ease,
Stir the mechanism, and the myriad transformations are harmonized."*

The Shizhen Zhenren said:
*"Hence it is said,"—meaning the continuity of these truths.
First, one must know Heaven and Earth’s principle of birth and death,
Then understand the three thievings’ alignment with Dao’s workings,
If the three thievings each find their fitting place,
And the Three Powers rest in their proper roles,
Then eating in season brings ease to the hundred bones,
And stirring the mechanism brings harmony to the myriad transformations.*

The Cao Daochong said:
*"All who seek to understand life and death must first eat and drink.
The Five Grains, Five Fruits, Five Flavors—
All must be seasoned and prepared appropriately,
Consumed in measure, fitting the body’s needs.
Cooked, they nourish; raw, they harm the organs—
This is the principle of eating."*

Thus, if eating and drinking follow their proper times,
And flavors accord with their due measures,
Only then does one stay within the Dao’s center,
Without exceeding its norms—
Then the hundred bones are all in harmony,
The Five Organs are at peace,
Free from all sickness,
And longevity is extended.

Hence it is said:
*"Eat in season, and the hundred bones are at ease."*

The Zhang Zifang said:
*"All things that are foul in hue,
Are not the true *qi* of harmony.
Those foul in scent,
Are not the true *qi* of balance.
Cooking that violates proper seasoning,
Is not the fulfillment of Water and Fire’s work.
What is produced out of season,
Is not the complete essence of life’s *qi*."*

The Sage warns against these four transgressions,
Thus the *Inner Classic* states:
*"Eat and drink with moderation,
Rest and rise with regularity,
Do not labor excessively or without purpose—
This is called knowing the Dao."*

Hence the virtuous person drinks the Heavenly Harmony to moisten the spirit,
And eats the Earth’s Virtue to nourish the form.

The Cui Minggong said:
*"The *Dao Classic* speaks:
'While all others possess it,
I alone am dull and coarse,
Yet I alone differ from others,
And value seeking food from the Mother.'
This is the profound meaning of eating in season."*

Eating in season brings ease to the hundred bones—
This is the application of the human Dao.
Stirring the mechanism brings harmony to the myriad transformations—
This is the essence of Heaven’s Dao.

Zhang Zifang’s hymn reads:
*"The three thievings in turn give and take,
Eating in season brings harmony to the hundred bones.
Gold and sand nourish the Five Organs like wind and rain,
Yet do not obstruct the Imperial House’s noble station."*

The Zhongli Zhenren’s *Manlu Hua* states:
*"All have the Dao within,
Yet the lost do not know its source.
Life and death by Heaven’s decree,
A marvel hidden in the mysterious pivot of the stars and constellations,
The shadow and movement shifting with each season.
With a tranquil heart, forgetting love and desire,
Adjusting the spirit in proper sequence—
Awakened wisdom, clear nature, the soul’s roundness.
If the Three Powers and the three thievings find their fitting place,
Then wealth for the nation is no difficulty.
Eating in season brings ease to the hundred bones,
Refining the elixir field.
No hindrance from the marketplace,
No obstruction in serving as court official.
Endless as the embryo’s breath,
The *qi* nourishes the infant—
Let the tortoise and hare go their way.
Humankind know their spirit when it is active,
Yet do not know the spirit’s stillness,
Nor the source of its vitality."*

The Cui Minggong said:
*"To rely solely on cleverness brings failure,
To rely solely on dullness brings confusion.
One clear, one dim—
This is called yin and yang.
One yin, one yang—
The Dao’s principle it is."*

The Lü Zhenren said:
*"Commoners take thunderous might and dazzling display as spirit,
The Sage takes boundless void and quiet stillness as the Dao.
The Dao is spirit.
Yet when one encounters the awe of lightning and thunder,
Or the fury of wind and rain,
The heart trembles in fear and calls it spirit—
They do not know that Heaven, Earth, and all things arise from this very void and stillness,
This is the spirit’s stillness,
The source of its vitality."*

The Zhongli said:
*"Spirit is subtle yet without form,
The unfathomable interplay of yin and yang.
Yet they know only that all things grow from yin and yang,
And do not know that yin and yang themselves arise from the spirit’s stillness.
The spirit’s stillness is the ultimate Dao.
Void and stillness are the Way of non-action.
Thus it is called the spirit’s stillness.
Within this stillness, yin and yang, sun and moon, the Three Powers, and all things are born—
This is the spirit’s stillness,
The source of its vitality."*

The Zifang said:
*"The Dao is ever non-acting yet nothing remains undone,
For its non-action is the true Dao.
Thus boundless and dark,
Yet within it lies essence.
Faint and indistinct,
Yet within it lies substance.
This is the ultimate Dao.
Within the spirit’s stillness lies the principle of the most profound spirit."*

Zhang Zifang’s hymn reads:
*"All know the spirit when it is active,
Yet the spirit flees and scatters like wind and cloud.
The spirit’s stillness brings natural transformation,
Prolonging life’s joy—
Only then does one know the Great Dao returns to its root."*

The **Master of Red Pine’s** *"Little Chongshan"* speaks:
*"Endless striving for profit and fame,
Exhausting ears and mind in vain pursuit—
Draining vital essence, depleting *qi*, harming the original spirit,
When the form and spirit are harmonized, wealth and life abandon none.
The Great Dao is vast and level,
Non-action as its wondrous function—
Yet action brings delusion.
Within the dark void, the spirit’s essence hides;
Remove the mysterious and obscure,
Only then does the radiant clarity appear.

The sun and moon have their measures,
Great and small have their fixed bounds.
From this arises the Sage’s work,
From this emerges divine luminosity."*

**Zhongli** said:
*"The sun and moon are the essence of yin and yang,
The most exalted within the Six Directions.
Days accumulate into months, months into years,
Circulating through the celestial sphere, each with its degrees—
Rising and setting, great and small.
Thus it is that the sun and moon have their measures,
And great and small have their fixed bounds."*

**Master Lü** said:
*"The sun and moon push each other, and light is born;
Cold and heat push each other, and the year is complete.
With warmth and coolness, cold and heat,
Spring, summer, autumn, and winter—
Thus Heaven and Earth nurture eternally.
All things are thereby created and born through this Dao.
Is it not the Sage’s work and divine luminosity?"*

**Master Xu** said:
*"All things—whether born from egg, womb, moisture, or transformed into metal, stone, grass, or wood—
The principles by which Heaven and Earth nurture all things
All arise from the void to the manifest.
Thus the Sage’s work is manifest.
All things in the world receive this Sage’s work and are born.
Therefore, great and small each have their fixed portion,
Neither overstepping nor envying.
Thus the great does not despise the small,
Nor the small covet the great—
Hence the *Peng* and the *Yuan* each soar freely, unburdened by comparison."*

**Master Liu Haichan** said:
*"What is seen is called *xiàng* [form],
What is shaped is called *qi* [instrument].
Speaking of *xiàng*, it is the sun and moon;
Speaking of *qi*, it is great and small.
Only when there is *xiàng* does number arise—
Thus, the sun and moon have their measures;
Only when there is *qi* does position arise—
Thus, great and small have their fixed bounds.
As the most refined of the Three Powers,
Conforming to the proper rise and fall of yin and yang,
The sun and moon’s movements fulfill the Sage’s work,
The spirit ascends to the Great Void—
Cultivation and verification lie within humanity,
High and low follow their course."*

**Master Cao’s** hymn:
*"The sun and moon rise and set by measure,
The *Guan* and *Kun* shift by the *yao* [trigram].
The Sage’s work departs of its own accord,
Great and small each find their resting place.
Han Xin crossed his thighs in humiliation,
Tao Qian bowed in shame at forced service.
Floating vanity and pure simplicity—
The *Peng* and *Yuan* each soar freely."*

**Master Zhang’s** hymn:
*"The boundless sky hides the sun and moon’s measure,
The *Kun* peaks first exchange their light.
Creation depends on the *xian* [celestial string] for sight,
The divine function accumulates—endless and vast."*

**Master Shi’s** *"Mantingfang"*:
*"True cinnabar, true sand—Heaven’s supreme treasure,
Must be carefully nurtured and preserved.
When the Five Phases are complete,
The *ying* and *zhi* intertwine.
Leaning on the Three Heavens and Two Earths,
Yin and yang unite, the Nine and Six in one vessel.
The essence merges, warm and gentle in the crucible,
Deep and flawless in its principle.
Hard and soft divide the *gua* [trigram] symbols,
Adjusting the mediating fire’s timing,
Using expedient means to retain.
When the Sage’s work is complete,
The nation prospers, the people thrive.
The *li* [hexagram] transforms from *Xu* to *Kan* to *Man*,
Pure yang returns—then there is a head.
Divine luminosity emerges,
High and low have their fixed ranks,
Following the ranks of the immortals.
Its mechanism is stolen—
None in the world can see it,
None can know it.
The gentleman who attains it preserves his life,
The petty man who attains it risks his fate."*

**Master Xu** said:
*"This repeats the meaning of the three thieves from earlier.
All theft must align with the Dao;
One cannot steal against the Dao.
Heaven has its seasons, Earth has its advantages.
I ride the seasons and advantages of Heaven and Earth,
Mountains and marshes nurture me—
Trees grow in my courtyard, like tilling fields.
Who does not steal?
Yet people do not know the mechanism of theft.
The gentleman and petty man differ in their intentions—
The gentleman attains it and preserves his life,
The petty man attains it and risks his fate."*

**Master Liu Haichan** said:
*"The gentleman knows that within the ultimate Dao lie all virtues.
What he seeks is harmonious,
What he practices is virtuous.
All his movements set virtuous mechanisms,
Aligned with the Dao’s patterns.
Through profound reflection and guarding the One,
He steals the subtle mysteries to nourish his nature,
Or plunders the spirit’s waters, the *Yingzi* Pool’s jade essence,
The golden liquid of immortality.
The worthy gentleman knows this wondrous mechanism,
Thus it is said: *The gentleman attains it and preserves his life.*
The petty man, glimpsing its tricks,
Lights his fate—
Ever habituated to evil deeds,
Ever scheming with cunning,
Only seeking wealth and jade,
Unmindful of toil.
Or practicing martial arts—
Would he shun fatigue?
Adorning himself with clever schemes to survive in the world’s vanity,
Thus wars and poisons arise, armies perish,
Chasing nobility leads to disgrace,
Greed harms oneself, lust brings calamity.
Though they gain glory, they cannot escape blame.
Truly, they do not know the Dao’s wondrous mechanism—
Thus it is said: *The petty man attains it and risks his fate.*"*

**Master Ge Xianweng** said:
*"The ultimate Dao is formless—
Thus none in the world can see it.
Its wondrous mechanism is boundless—
Thus none in the world can know its principle.
The worthy attain it and preserve their life,
The unworthy are ruined by it—
Thus the petty man attains it and risks his fate."*

**Master Ge Xianweng’s** hymn:
*"The worthy exhaust principles, merging with the void,
Awakening to the *Guan* and *Kun*’s alchemical furnace.
The petty scholar only contends for name and gain—
The fields and graves are their destined path."*

**Master Lü’s** *"Xingxiangzi"*:
*"The wondrous Dao is profound and subtle,
Few can attain it—
Even the brightest minds find it hard to see or know.
Dark and obscure, the sovereign’s essence,
Faint and indistinct, its form.
It hides true essence, conceals its symbols,
Called the Heavenly mechanism.
The worthy exhaust principles,
Secretly guarding the Three Wonders,
While the foolish chase illusions, lost in delusion.
Greedy for wealth and lust,
Their actions are not virtuous.
They squander their spirit lightly,
Their life and fate—
Foolishly applied."*

**The True Person’s** *"Su Zhongqing"*:
*"The noble gentleman’s nature is peaceful,
Not contending with things."*

*"Only the foolish and unknowing,
Vying for hollow fame in the snail’s horn.
The profound and wondrous principle,
Recorded in the True Scripture,
Brings wealth and secures the people.*

*Dark and obscure, the sovereign’s essence,
Faintly and deeply concealed,
Those who awaken—Daos born.*

**The Yellow Emperor’s *Yinshu Jing* (Collected Commentaries, Middle and Lower Volumes):**
*The Yellow Emperor, Red Pine Child, Zhang Liang the True Person,
The Left Daoist of the Great Extremes, Terence Kang,
The True Person of Western Mountain, Zhongli Quan the True Person of Rectified Yang,
Lü Yan the True Person of Pure Yang, the True Person of Hua yang,
Shi Jianwu, Cui Minggong the True Person of Ultimate Unity,
Liu Xuanying the True Person of the Sea Tortoise,
Cao Daochong the True Person of Clear and Empty.*

**Chapter on *Qiangbing* (Strong Arms) and *Yanshu* (Victorious Arts):**
*Zhongli the True Person said:*
*'Strong' refers to vigor and health;
*'Arms' denotes the tools for warding off barbarians.*

*The *De Jing* states:*
*'To nurture life is auspicious;
To direct *qi* with the heart is strength.'*
*The *I Ching* declares:*
*'The movements of Heaven are vigorous—
The noble gentleman strengthens himself and never rests.'*

*This speaks of embodying Heaven’s pure yang virtue,
Commanding all living beings,
With the heart as sovereign and *qi* as the army—
The ruler acts without action,
And all is governed.
This is the Dao of serene stillness and non-action.*

*To subdue demons with the Dao,
None shall fail.*

*Thus it is said:*
*'Strong arms, victorious arts.'*

**Master Lü’s** words:
*'The Sage establishes laws,
Intending only to suppress evil and restore order,
To govern the state and bring peace to the people.
How could it be for scheming with stratagems,
Discussing martial arts and raising armies,
Driving living beings to toil,
Slaughtering lives and gathering misfortune,
Accumulating sins and bringing calamity to descendants?
Even as Sun, Wu, Han, and Bai
Employed cunning and deceitful schemes,
Their bones became hills, their blood rivers,
Leaving all living beings in endless suffering,
And rulers with countless worries—
Could this be called great merit or broad vision?
Hence the *Five Thousand Words* says:*
*"To govern with wisdom is the thief of the state;
Not to govern with wisdom is the state’s blessing."*
*And again:*
*"Fine arms are not auspicious instruments."*

*Therefore, the *Yinshu* places this in the lower section.*

**Master Shi’s** praise:
*"To act well without trace is called strong arms;
To repel invaders and dispel barbarians is the essence of arms.
To forget the self when facing adversity is victory;
Thus, how should one cultivate and govern to secure peace and honor?"*

**Master Cao’s** *"Qingxiao Yue"*:
*"The heart as sovereign, *qi* as general—
The army of kindness as banners, wisdom as encampments.
Discipline and rhythm set the plans,
Righteousness and benevolence as armor—
Frugality and reverence as provisions,
Virtue ensuring tranquility.
Temperate and loyal, modest and cautious,
Orders march with trust and integrity.
Filial piety and harmony array the ranks,
The demonic forces surrender at a single strike.*

*The blind excel in hearing,
The deaf excel in sight.
Cutting off profit at its source,
Deploy tenfold armies;
Repeating reflection day and night,
Deploy ten thousandfold armies.*

**Cui Minggong said:**
*'The blind hear and the deaf see—
This is due to their singular focus,
Thus they are called skilled.*
*But if one can concentrate with unwavering sincerity,
And act with precise timing,
All endeavors shall be fully rewarded.
Moreover, if one can ponder deeply,
Reflecting day and night,
The benefits gained exceed ordinary wisdom ten thousandfold.'"

「The Master Cui Minggong said: The Way/Teacher, is the heart. All actions and movements arise from the heart; when the spirit and heart are concentrated in singularity, nothing fails to be accomplished.

The Master Hai Manzi praised:
*The blind hear, the deaf observe—only through utmost sincerity,
Cutting off profit at its source, the sage’s emotions remain pure.
Deploying armies day and night, with threefold reflection,
Qi and blood merge, and the elixir forms naturally.*

The Sage Cao Zhenren sang in *Su Mu Zhe*:
*"The blind dispel darkness, the deaf extinguish sound,
Cutting off profit, armies move with tenfold efficacy.
A myriad of laws do not stray from the mind’s measure,
Guarding the celestial harmony with care,
This is the way to cultivate True Essence.*

*Only with a vacant heart does the spirit settle,
Within emptiness and stillness, Dao/Way and qi return to their proper order.
Threefold reflection and clarity of timing—first attend to the root,
Qi and blood merge, and the elixir depends on lead and mercury.*

*The heart arises from things, yet perishes through things—its opportunity lies in the eyes.
Zhang Zifang said:
*The critical moment of life and death lies in things,
The fate of success and failure is seen in the eyes.*

The Sage Xu Zhenren said:
*Men of virtue/Way do not let the heart arise in vain,
Nor do they let opportunity move without cause.
The vulgar and ignorant covet all things to enrich themselves,
Yet are plundered by them, harming their true nature—
This is how the heart arises from things and perishes through things.*

The Old Sage Ge Xianweng said:
*Knowing contentment brings no shame,
Knowing restraint brings no peril—
Thus one may endure long.*

The ignorant stir the heart with false desires,
Adding to the allure of myriad things;
All because the eyes perceive, and the heart responds—
Hence it is said: opportunity lies in the eyes.*

The Master Cui Minggong said:
*Those whose opportunity lies in the eyes must guard their vision,
Lest they gaze upon what should not be seen.*

Thus the *Taoist Canon* states:
*"Seeing no desirable sights,
The heart remains undisturbed—this is the way."*

Zhang Zifang praised:
*The heart, ensnared by the spectacle of myriad things,
Is tormented by the flames of greed for wealth and honor.
When the heart’s master is lost in obscurity, yet spirit does not scatter,
Naturally the Dao/Way’s essence aligns with the Primordial.*

Cui Minggong sang in *Lin Jiang Xian*:
*The heart stirs from the sight of things,
Forgotten is the opportunity—all illusions vanish.*

The scriptures say: *Close the mouth of the senses and seal its gate.*
The words of the sages are profound and wondrous,
Those who understand will extend their years.

In our family’s Dao/Way, those who know it
Cherish their households, secure their nations, and cultivate their bodies.
With calm and steady refinement, they guard the spirit’s essence.
Awakening to the opportunity in the eyes,
Both heart and vision become clear.

The heavens bestow no favor, yet great virtue/Way arises from it.*

Zhang Zifang said: *The heavens have no heart yet bestow virtue/Way upon all things,
All things have hearts yet return virtue/Way to the heavens.*
Thus the *Five Thousand Words* [of the Daoist Canon] states:
*The heavens and earth are not virtuous/ren, treating all things as fodder for horses and dogs;
The sage is not virtuous/ren, treating the people as fodder for horses and dogs.*
To give without demanding repayment,
To nurture without claiming credit for deeds.

Xu Zhenren said: *To lack a heart is called lacking virtue/Way,
Yet when one abides in purity and stillness, things cannot deceive them—then virtue/Way of the heavens arises.*
Zhang Zifang’s ode declares:
*The heavens’ qi lacks virtue/Way yet transforms and gives birth,
The Three Fields [of the body] retain the alchemy of changing into priceless treasures.*
Yin and yang fermented, ascending to the elixir of immortality—
This is how virtue/Way arises from lack, generating great virtue/Way.

Ge Xianhuang’s *Western River Moon* [song] states:
*Preserve the Original Heavenly Truth without artifice,
Lacking a heart is the same as lacking virtue/Way.*
Follow the natural process, refining and shaping into form,
Return to the root, the source is self.
In desire, virtue/Way lacks yet transforms—
The Three Fields change into priceless treasures.
How does virtue/Way arise from lack to become great?
A single grain of elixir ensures eternal life.

Swift thunder and fierce winds—
None fail to tremble in awe.
Zhang Zifang said: *Swift thunder and fierce winds,
Their might extends far yet their terror is near—all things tremble and fear them.*
The heavens originally do not threaten things yet are themselves feared,
And all under heaven submit as they do to the sage.

In bestowing rewards, there is virtue/Way without demand;
In inflicting punishments, there is might without blame.
Rewards and punishments are established by the ruler,
Virtue/Way and might are naturally followed below.

Xu Zhenren said: *When thunder shakes the earth,
The virtuous one uses fear to reflect and correct;
When winds blow gently,
The virtuous one applies the mandate and acts accordingly.*
Shi Zhenren said: *As for military campaigns,
If the ruler can thus command awe above and fear below,
Surely they will be able to pacify chaos and eliminate evil.*
Thus it is said: *There exists a strategy below to subdue strong armies with victory.*
Chi Songzi’s ode proclaims:
*Winds and thunder stir the times as they come,
Creation races onward, giving birth to all things.*
If military orders are trusted and executed according to law,
Then tyrants and violence are cut down, securing peace.

Cao Zhenren’s *White Crane Child* [text] states:
*At times, the wind serves as the chariot’s reins,
The thunderwheel drives all forward.*
Proclaiming the heavens’ commands,
A grand spectacle of the two spirits’ might.
Shaking the depths of the earth’s veins,
Startling the valleys back to spring.
When will you employ might and virtue/Way?
With a single technique, the borders will be stilled.*

The utmost joy is the overflow of nature,
The utmost stillness brings purity.
Zhang Zifang said: *Awareness lies in the eyes.*
Chi Songzi said: *Nature, this is the yin.*
Joy leads to excess and yin flourishes,
Stillness brings rectitude and the spirit clears.

Ge Xianweng said: *The sage does not indulge in utmost joy yet cherishes utmost stillness.
Those who dwell the spirit between stillness and joy are called Guarding the Middle.*
Thus, advantages and power cannot seduce,
Sounds and colors cannot sway,
Persuasive speakers cannot convince,
The wise cannot move,
The brave cannot intimidate.
Seeing blessings beyond the heavy gates,
Anticipating calamities within the unseen depths—
Even the heavens will not oppose them,
How much more so the deceitful strategies of war?

Shi Zhenren’s ode states:
*Utmost joy cannot compare to utmost stillness of heart,
Free from dust and impurity, abandoning excess.*
When deeds are fulfilled and the Dao/Way is complete, the elixir is ready—
Then the intent of *Yin Symbols* [Yin Fu] is revealed.
Its meaning is profound.

Lu Zhenren’s *Suzu Mu Zhe* [song] states:
*Guard the void and softness,
Nurture the true nature,
Nourish the yang spirit—
Retreat lies in the heart’s stillness.*
When the vast qi harmonizes and the spirit is refined, one attains sainthood.
Using the Dao/Way to eliminate evil,
All illusions vanish.
This is the art of war—
The yin spirit perishes,
The formations of virtue/Way and compassion arise—
Going forth brings victory, returning ensures safety.
Not like the common folk using tricks for fortune,
Luring calamity and inviting retribution to harm innocent lives.

The heavens’ utmost secrecy,
Used with utmost fairness.

The Master Zhang [Zhang Liang] said:
When the heavens and earth are in a state of *yun-yun* [氤氲], this is the utmost *private*—
Yet all things transform and take form, this is the utmost *public*.

Master Lü [Lü Dongbin] said:
When the Dao/Way exists beneath the heavens, it is first called the "mother of the heavens and earth"—this is the utmost *private*.
Yet once one obtains this mother, one knows its offspring;
Once one knows its offspring, one returns to guard the mother—this is the utmost *public*.

Master Chi Songzi [赤松子] said:
The heavens and earth give birth to all things,
Yet all things bear *yin*—this is the utmost *private*;
Yet they embrace *yang*—this is the utmost *public*.

Those who understand the Dao/Way of *public* and *private* shall know the workings of the numinous.

Master Zhongli [Zhongli Quan] extolled:
The heavens and earth in *yun-yun* are like the utmost *private*,
Yet in giving birth without possession lies the utmost *public* moment.
Used with utmost *public* like the south and north,
Deployed with numinous sanctity like the east and west.

Master Lü’s *Wang Jiang Nan* [望江南] states:
The Great Dao/Way—all things are made manifest.
With use, there is no use;
Within non-action, divine function resides.
Ascending and descending know no end.
The Mysterious and the Feminine—
Creation unites with the True Void.
When the heavens and earth unite, sweet dew descends,
The mechanisms of the Dao—hidden and revealed—like *private* and *public*.
Returning and reverting is the way of homage.
The rule of *qi* lies in the creatures.

Master Cao [Cao Guojiu] said:
The void transforms into the numinous,
The numinous transforms into *qi*.
When *qi* is strong, it rules over things,
Yet when weak, it is ruled by things—
Thus it is said: *The rule of creatures lies in qi.*

Master Xu [Xu Xun] said:
Even birds can ride upon the regulated *qi* of purity and voidness,
Their hearts move, their wings beat—
Soaring between the clouds and the heavens,
Above and below all centered within themselves.
How much more so for humans, the most refined yet unrefined?

If one can skillfully employ the *qi* of the Dao/Way’s natural virtue/power,
Then preserving one’s life to attain longevity is no great difficulty.

Master Shi [Shi Chunting] said:
*Qi* is the origin of life.
Those who skillfully gather and nourish *qi*
Can even overcome the mightiest of oxen and tigers,
The strongest of armor and weapons—
What then of lesser things?

Master Hai Chanzi [Hai Chanzi] extolled:
To rule over creatures, first subdue the tiger and dragon,
Then all things naturally follow.
The Master’s precepts and the art of communion with spirits—
Grasping *yin* and *yang*, mastering the center.
Master Cui [Cui]’s *Man Ting Fang* [满庭芳] states:
The soul wanders east and west,
The spirit moves south and north—
Within this lies another layer of profound mystery.
The Dao/Way has no form or trace;
Its subtle words are divided and refined.
Blood is like cinnabar,
Mercury is the precious essence—
The spirit of things is like silver and lead.
In the central palace, they are joined and matched in loving union.
Kunlun’s jade communicates with the Azure Sea—first refined.
Having returned to the origin and essence,
The Pearl of Foolishness and the Nine-Twisted Ant can pierce through.
Harvesting the marrow of the Moon Rabbit,
With the Master’s craft—
Mixing the black liver of the crow.
At the moment of ruling over creatures,
Thirty-six transformations complete,
Ascending to the Penglai Mountains.

Life is the root of death;
Death is the root of life.

「Master Cao [Zhenren] said: Those who seek life must first cultivate it and then face death;
Those who practice death must first embrace death and then attain life.

Master Zhang [Zifang] said: Those who seek life are ensnared by the sights and sounds of the world,
Weary their spirit and exhaust their qi,
Greedily pursue honor and wealth,
While the fires of desire consume them—
Misfortune and calamity follow in their wake;
Why delay death?

Those who practice death dwell in a murky void of ignorance,
Their spirit serene and unattached,
Their qi tranquil and without purpose.
A thousand worries fail to move them,
And seeking death, they cannot find it—
For the path to eternal life lies here.

Master Ge [Xianweng] extolled:
Few know the Gate of Life and the Door of Death,
Yet their operation lies within the trigrams **Kàn** and **Lí**.
When the two **Bā** are consumed, the yang qi grows strong;
At the three **Yīn** and three **Yáng**, the essence is refined.
Master Zhang [Zifang]’s *White Crane’s Son* states:
If one seeks the Dao/Way of immortality,
First, one must recognize the primordial root.

For the mind gives rise to scattered spirit,
And when the worldly attachments vanish, wisdom returns clear.
The heavens and earth serve as crucible and furnace,
While yin and yang act as fuel and flame.
Refined into the supreme elixir,
The work complete—one departs to meet the True.

Virtue/power born of harm,
Harm born of virtue/power.

Master Zhōnglí [Zhenren] said:
Virtue/power is the source of harm,
Harm is the current of virtue/power.

Master Lǚ [Zhenren] said:
The fundamental cause is virtue/power born of qi,
Yet failing to preserve the innate purity—
Drifting in the river of love,
Carried by the tides of desire—
This is virtue/power yielding harm,
Harm arising from virtue/power.

Master Xǔ [Zhenren] extolled:
Virtue/power born of qi has no intrinsic origin,
Yet harm arises when virtue/power is applied without reason.
Guarding the beginning with diligence,
Refining the elixir to perfection—
Even spirits are astonished.
Master Chìsōngzǐ’s *Lín Jiāng Xiān* states:
To return with sincerity is to love the spring,
Yet to cling endlessly is to recognize this as virtue/power.
Who knows that harm still grows within virtue/power?
When desire fades, virtue/power naturally perishes,
And with virtue/power gone, harm has no foundation.
Offspring stems from virtue/power’s cause,
Yet excessive virtue/power harms one’s form.
Those who refine virtue/power’s qi nurture a precious treasure—
Thirty-six transformations fulfilled,
Paying homage to the Jade Sovereign’s Cup.

The foolish see the heavens and earth’s patterns as sacred teachings,
I see the world’s timely shifts as wise revelations.
Master Zhang [Zifang] said:
Celestial patterns are the sun, moon, stars, and constellations—
Lightning, rain, wind, and clouds.
Earthly patterns are mountains, seas, metals, and stones—
Grasses, trees, scales, and feathers.
The foolish delight in auspicious stars, clouds of blessing,
Pure winds and sweet dews,
Or drink from the wine-springs and feast on rare grains,
Or behold the phoenix, deer, and immortal fungi—
All these they take as joy.
Yet when they see eclipses,
Seasons out of order,
Ominous comets and pestilential vapors,
Floods and droughts, locust plagues,
Sudden rains and violent winds,
Heavens dark and earth trembling—
They are seized with fear,
Dreading calamity may strike them.
Observing these celestial and terrestrial patterns,
They believe them to be lessons of caution,
Warnings to reflect and refine—
Thus, they ascend from the common to the sage,
And are called the *Patterned Sage*.

Master Liǔ Hǎichán said:
As the Yellow Emperor [Huangdi] composed the *Yīn Fú* [Scripture],
He first raised the foolish who saw the heavens and earth’s patterns as sacred teachings,
Then humbly declared: “I see the world’s timely shifts as wise revelations,
Meaning that what follows comes first.”

Master Xǔ [Zhenren] said:
The *Patterned Sage* of timely shifts refers to human affairs—
One need not gaze upon celestial omens,
But must always follow the Dao/Way in harmony with the times,
And even if disasters arise, they will not harm.

Master Chìsōngzǐ said:
Order belongs to the virtuous,
Chaos to the unworthy.
Embodying the heavens and conforming to the Dao/Way,
Adjusting to the seasons and aligning with the times—
With this refined understanding,
All worldly dualities dissolve into pure yang,
And the True Dao/Way is complete.

Master Zhōnglí [Zhenren] extolled:
Though celestial omens are lofty and profound,
They reveal auspicious and inauspicious signs—
Even the foolish, when enlightened,
Reflect and refine with diligence,
And thus have no cause for worry.
Fortune and misfortune are self-summoned,
Yet by observing the world’s shifts,
One discerns the rise and fall of all things.
Seizing the moment with virtue/power,
And always acting with benevolence—
Calamities and misfortunes are forever banished.

The *Yīn Fú* [Scripture]’s meaning is simple yet profound,
Its words subtle, its essence dense—
It guides the lost and enlightens the ignorant.
Its radiant light spreads far,
Illuminating the darkest paths.
Holding fast to the One, the elixir is perfected—
The realm grows rich, the people secure and tranquil,
The spirits rejoice in purity.
Strengthened armies prevail,
Pure yang refined—
One strides into the Mysterious Metropolis [Xuan Du].
The *Yīn Fú* [Scripture] of the Yellow Emperor concludes.」
