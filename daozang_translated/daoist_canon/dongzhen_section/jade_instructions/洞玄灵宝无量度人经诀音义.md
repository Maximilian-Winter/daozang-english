When reciting the *Ten Revered Scriptures of the Most High’s Cavern of Mystery and Numinous Treasure of Limitless Salvation*, first perform three bows facing east, then stand facing north, turn left to face east, and strike the teeth thirty-six times. Visualize five-colored clouds and qi filling the chamber, with the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Black Warrior, Vermilion Bird, and Phoenix guarding front and rear, while jade maidens, immortal youths, divine officials of the Five Thearchs, and nine hundred million legions of immortals, gods, and celestial soldiers encamp to left and right. After shaking the body thrice and completing the recitation, descend from the southern side to the earth, bowing as before.

*(From the* Golden Register of Simplified Scriptures*.)*

When unveiling the numinous mysteries and reciting scriptures, one must burn incense, don the proper ritual vestments, and pay homage to the scripture according to the rites. Recite the incantation:

Silent, it reaches the ultimate origin,
Vast as the blade of kalpas, lofty as *Ā*.
Profound and open, the text of the Cavern of Mystery—
Who can fathom its depths?
Entering the path of the Great Vehicle,
Who reckons the kalpas’ span?
Neither born nor destroyed,
Yet born from the lotus.
Transcending the three realms’ bonds,
With compassion, unraveling the world’s snares.
The Perfected, of unsurpassed virtue,
Generation after generation, dwell as immortals.

*(From the* Supreme Ultimate Precious Instructions*.)*

The *Divine Incantation for Preserving Life* follows the same incantation and method as above.

The *Wondrous Scripture of Limitless Salvation, Supreme Grade, from the Most High’s Cavern of Mystery and Numinous Treasure* presents both the Dao and its methods, encompassing the general and the particular, serving as the Dharma King of the Most High’s dispensation and the transforming sovereign proclaimed by the Lord of the Dao.

*Cavern of Mystery and Numinous Treasure* is the overarching title of the Ten Scriptures, while *Limitless Salvation* is the distinct designation of this scroll. *Supreme* is the most exalted appellation, and *Most High* the loftiest honorific. Lofty, it dwells above without summit; vast, no thing surpasses it. Thus, *Most High* signifies the sage’s embodiment of noble virtue, exhausting principle and perfecting subtlety, turning and returning beyond measure—difficult to conceive, hence the name.

*Cavern* denotes emptiness, unimpeded flow, openness, and non-action, its clarity pervading the distant and its brilliance penetrating the profound. *Mystery* signifies profundity, remoteness, and wondrous tranquility, its principle abstruse and its origins obscure. *Numinous* refers to luminous essence and radiant wisdom, responding to transformations and fulfilling the proper end of nature, its wisdom pervading the ten thousand conditions. *Treasure* signifies rarity, excellence, and exalted honor, its manifestations shaping heaven and earth, its qi nurturing the myriad beings.

*Limitless Salvation*:
*Limitless* denotes what is beyond being; *measure* signifies the extremity of number; *salvation* means to ferry others across; *human* refers to the classification of beings. This signifies the salvation of gods and humans beyond all measure, guiding all who ascend to enter the wondrous gate, perfecting the aspirant’s heart to return to formlessness.

*Supreme Grade Wondrous Scripture*:
This scripture originates before the beginning, first among all teachings. Among the grades, it is supreme, its primordial source ever profound—hence, the *Wondrous Scripture*.

Exploring its purport, its meaning is limitless. In elucidating this limitlessness, five aspects emerge:

1. **Limitless in Essence**: The Celestial Worthy’s origin is ancient and unfathomable. Whether in true or responsive form, provisional or realized wisdom, it is thus named *Dragon Han*, yet is formless; styled *Kaihuang*, yet called *Yuanshi*. Adapting to conditions, it prescribes medicine for illness, its responses inexhaustible, its origin ever-present—this is the first, the limitless essence.

2. **Limitless in Virtue**: Dwelling in primordial yang, serene and still, its mouth emits five-colored light, illuminating the great chiliocosm. It enables those who receive the Dharma to hear the scripture in the realm of the Most High—this is the second, the limitless virtue.

3. **Limitless in Power**: The sage harbors sun and moon, regulates yin and yang, halts mountains and arrests rivers, harmonizing the sequence of qi. With a thousand cuts, it severs heads; subduing demons, it vanquishes evil. With ten thousand transformations, it severs forms, ensuring the perverse does not disturb the upright—this is the third, the limitless power.

4. **Limitless in Grade**: While ordinary things possess grades—high and low, few and many—the sage responds to conditions without high or low, adapting to circumstances without excess or deficiency. It cannot be measured by high or low, nor grasped by few or many. Thus, it is without grade, and being without grade, it is limitless—this is the fourth, the limitless grade.

5. **Limitless in Sound**: The sage expounds without words, yet the exposition is inexhaustible; resonates without sound, yet the resonance is unending. It enables understanding across kalpas and enlightenment among gods and humans. Thus, it is called the *hidden speech of Great Brahmā*, the *limitless sound*, or the *sound within heaven*—this is the fifth, the limitless sound.

This briefly outlines its general meaning.

*(From the* Preface to the Ten Scriptures of the Cavern of Mystery and Numinous Treasure*.)*

The *Clarifying Regulations of the Four Poles* states: When reciting scriptures, one must align heart and eyes, avoiding wayward gazing and stray thoughts. Each time one unfolds the scroll and completes the verses, one must not pause midway or skip the celestial sounds. Three transgressions render immortality unattainable; five or more condemn one to the Three Paths and Five Sufferings of hell for ten thousand kalpas.

The *Hidden Commentary* states: After reading five hundred words of scripture, knock the teeth three times, lick the upper and lower lips with the tongue, and swallow saliva three times. This prevents exhaustion, clears the voice over time, and without this method, one harms the qi and wearies the spirit.

*(From the* Preface to the Heart-Cultivation Practices of the Cavern of Mystery and Numinous Treasure Rituals*.)*

People often recite the *Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Limitless Salvation of Humans*, yet while they may know the visualization incantations, few understand the proper measures. Here, these are fully expounded for clarity.

From the title onward, the descent of the Primordial Beginning’s true scripture—being the eulogies of the Dao Lord—should follow the *Cavern of Mystery’s* Ten Scriptures. When inwardly intoning the inner sounds, one must adhere to the original method. Below, these are listed in order.

Upon reaching the words of the Dao, proceed as follows, visualizing and invoking the officiant and the cyclical signs Jia and Yi. If reciting for oneself, omit the phrase "and for others"; if reciting for another, omit "your servant." The heart cannot serve two masters. If reciting for both self and others, follow the original text. Upon completion, draw qi thirty-two times, slowly inhaling the qi of the Thirty-Two Heavens, then proceed with the recitation as prescribed. This is precisely the visualization method of the *Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humans*.

For the "Practice of the Dao" chapter: knock the teeth thirty-two times to ascend to the Thirty-Two Heavens, and bow in the heart thirty-two times. Each time, silently recite the names of the heavens, inwardly perceiving each, and bow in the heart. Though the body remains still, the heart prostrates as if the body were bowing. Practice this thoroughly beforehand to know the heavens’ locations, lest one falter in the moment, causing delay or disorder. All visualizations and invocations follow this principle.

**The Eight Heavens of the East (Nine Qi of the Azure Heavens, beginning from the north and proceeding south):**
Great Yellow Sovereign Layered Heaven, Great Bright Jade Complete Heaven, Clear Bright Harmonious Youth Heaven, Primordial Countenance Level Nurturing Heaven, Primordial Bright Literary Ascension Heaven, Seven Luminaries Rubbing Yi Heaven, Void Transcending Heng Heaven, Great Ultimate Concealing Canopy Heaven.

**The Eight Heavens of the South (Three Qi of the Cinnabar Heavens, beginning from the east and proceeding west):**
Vermilion Bright Harmonious Yang Heaven, Primordial Bright Reverent Splendor Heaven, Radiant Bright Ancestral Fluttering Heaven, Bamboo Grove August Reed Heaven, Void Bright Hall Radiance Heaven, Observing Bright Upright Stillness Heaven, Primordial Bright Reverent Celebration Heaven, Great Resplendent Ultimate Jade Heaven.

**The Eight Heavens of the West (Seven Qi of the White Heavens, beginning from the south and proceeding north):**
Primordial Bearing Aperture Ascension Heaven, Great Peace August Cliff Heaven, Manifest Stability Ultimate Wind Heaven, Beginning August Filial Awn Heaven, Great Yellow Converging Weight Heaven, No-Thought River Origin Heaven, Upper Gambling Joy Heaven, Limitless Vow Oath Heaven.

**The Eight Heavens of the North (Five Qi of the Black Mysterious Heavens, beginning from the west and proceeding east):**
Luminous Court Rosy Crossing Heaven, Abyssal Penetrating Primordial Cavern Heaven, Brush Adorned Wondrous Completion Heaven, Elegant Joy Forbidden Upper Heaven, Peerless Constant Fusion Heaven, Jade Dragon Ascending Victory Heaven, Dragon Transformation Brahmā Crossing Heaven, Level Nurturing Excellence Heaven.

**Method for Inwardly Intending the Inner Sounds of the Heavens**

**Eastern Danlou Sixty-Four Character Visualization Method:**
Knock the teeth nine times, visualize nine-colored dragons guiding before and behind, with nine layers of azure clouds enveloping the body. Recite the incantation:
*"Vermilion Brightness unfolds the chart,
Eight qi return to the true.
Governing the primordial pass,
Azure Emperor, great spirit.
Flowing transformations beyond the nine,
Entwining my body.
Spiritual sounds of eight writings,
Sixty-four chapters.
Illuminating heaven and earth,
Uniting with me in immortality.
Conveying the dragon chariot,
Ascending to the imperial axle."*

Upon completion, draw qi and swallow nine times. After nine years of practice, the eight heavens each send eight azure-waisted jade maidens and eight azure-flower jade lads to attend the body, bestowing the essence of azure teeth, generating bodily radiance that penetrates the void. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is accomplished, enabling flight. Seven ancestors share this fortune and ascend to the Southern Palace.

**Southern Nanyan Sixty-Four Character Visualization Method:**
Knock the teeth three times, visualize vermilion phoenixes and phoenixes soaring before you, with three layers of crimson clouds enveloping the body. Silently recite the incantation:
*"Three qi meander,
Spiritual phoenixes come flying.
Jade sounds of eight characters,
Resplendent in the Purple Tenuity.
Auspicious day, great celebration,
My Dao opens wide.
Vermilion cinnabar feeds,
Gazing upward to absorb the spiritual radiance.
Body generates water and fire,
Crimson-clad in feathered robes.
Ascending the void, stepping in flight,
Feet tread the phoenix ladder.
Circulating through the eight heavens,
Seven ancestors follow.
Upon completion, draw qi and swallow three times. After three years of practice, the eight heavens each send eight great cinnabar jade maidens and eight great yang jade lads to attend the body, descending the essence of the three vermilion cinnabar qi. Complexion reverses to youth, enduring ten thousand kalpas without decline. Seven ancestors transcend and ascend, entering the Hall of Fortune, returning to the womb of royal lineage to be reborn.

**Western Daoli Sixty-Four Character Visualization Method:**
Knock the teeth seven times, visualize white tigers and lions guiding left and right, with seven layers of white clouds enveloping the body. Silently recite the incantation:
*"Seven qi of golden numen,
Eight heavens’ honored spirits.
White tigers draw the carriage,
Lions bear the axle.
Seven qi entwine,
Refining me into immortality.
Body ascends golden light,
Shining upon white clouds.
Inner and outer transformations,
Ascending into the cavern gate.
Seven ancestors emerge from night,
Nine dark realms’ souls return.
Eons of deliverance,
Abiding with the turning of the Dao."*

Upon completion, draw qi and swallow seven times. After seven years of practice, the eight heavens each send eight white numinous jade lads to attend the body, descending the essence of the seven great white qi. Age halts, countenance remains youthful for ten thousand kalpas. Blessings extend to seven ancestors, who ascend to the Southern Palace, returning to the womb to be reborn in royal lineage, generation after generation.

The Northern Jue’s Sixty-Four Character Method of Mindful Recitation:
Strike the teeth five times, envision soaring dragons with feathered canopies lush and dense on left and right, five layers of black clouds enveloping the body. Divine lads and jade maidens in feathered robes and flying garments attend before and behind. Recite the esoteric incantation:

*"Primordial Heaven lingers,
Flowing radiance ascends to Supreme Clarity.
Great Possession initiates the turning,
Eight characters rise in luminous height.
Flying essence stills the void,
Cavernous yin spontaneously arises.
Five qi entwine,
Irrigating my form.
Crowned and girded at Northern Solitude,
Receiving refinement from cavernous numina.
Kidney palace emerges from the north,
Inner and outer gleam with essence.
Soaring through the Three Realms,
Roaming and feasting in the Purple Court.
Seven ancestors rejoice together,
Delighting in kalpas of age.
Within the Seven Treasures Grove,
Returning to the womb to be reborn.
Emerging from eternal night,
Names recorded in the Southern Palace.
Yellow registers and white tablets,
Generation after generation born as immortals."*

Upon completion, draw qi and swallow five times. After five years of practice, the eight heavens each send eight lads of Grand Primordial Jade to attend the body, descending the essence of the five numinous qi. Years reverse, countenance remains youthful, life preserved in the Three Clarities. Blessings extend to seven ancestors, generation after generation born as immortals.

This scripture was received by the Most High Lord of the Dao from the Primordial Celestial Worthy and transmitted to the world. The Lord of the Dao composed three prefaces: the first, the middle, and the last. The first preface begins with *Dao* speaks of the past... and ends with facing east to recite the scripture. The middle preface follows the *Song of the Three Realms* and includes these two chapters, which together constitute the *Profound and Luminous Utmost Words*. The last preface begins with *Among the heavens...* and concludes with *Great Measure, Profound and Mysterious*.

The scripture contains two chapters: the first from *Primordial Mysterious* to *Proclaiming the Upper Clarity*, and the latter from *Primordial Jade Calendar* to *Disasters befalling the seven ancestors*. The esoteric incantations of the Great Brahmā are not counted among these two chapters. Some mistakenly treat the scripture as one chapter and the esoteric verses as two, which is also incorrect. The middle preface states: *Reciting the scripture ten thousand times enables one to attain the Dao*. The *Profound and Luminous Utmost Words* are thus esoteric and abstruse, not part of the two chapters of the scripture proper.

Those who recite this text must believe wholeheartedly without doubt. When merit is complete and the Dao perfected, profound understanding will naturally arise. Both humans and celestials share in the blessings, and the living and the deceased alike receive grace. How can one not be resolute? How can one not strive?

The *Records of Mysterious Verifications of the Daoist Gate* and the *Collected Verifications of the Daoist Gate* contain accounts of those who attained verification through upholding this scripture, all of which have been transmitted. Those who seek communion with the true should diligently practice this.

The *Pronunciation and Meaning of the Precepts of the Numinous Treasure Scripture of Limitless Salvation* concludes here.
