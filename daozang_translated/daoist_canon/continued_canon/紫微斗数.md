#### Method for Calculating Age from Birth Year

At ten years, begin with the *jiaxu* year;
At twenty, *jiazi* reverses its flow.
At thirty, *jiayin* holds its place;
At forty, *jiachen* sets the course.
At fifty, *jiawu* stands firm;
At sixty, the cycle rests in *shen* first.
When the wheel reaches the year of birth,
One may then know the age to be reckoned.

By this method, observe in which celestial stem and branch one was born, then count forward by tens to *jia*, noting in which branch it falls. From this *jia*, reverse the flow to the birth branch, and the number of years is revealed.

#### Examples of Hourly Correspondences for Infants

*Zi, wu, mao, you* face the father’s birth,
Their forms small and delicate, crowns level.
*Yin, shen, si, hai* bear twin crowns,
Half inclined toward the father, bodies balanced.
*Chen, xu, chou, wei* lean toward a slanted crown,
Born with their backs to the father, bodies stout.

---

#### Examples for Determining the Hour

Midnight is the *zi* hour, the cock’s crow *chou*;
Dawn is *yin*, sunrise *mao*.
The meal hour is *chen*, midday *wu*;
The afternoon slant is *wei*, dusk *xu*.
Sleep belongs to *hai*, the evening meal to *shen*;
Sunset is *you*.

*Shu Tianji*

**Stars Distributed Across the Twelve Palaces**
Celestial Staff (Tianzhang), Celestial Anomaly (Tianyi), Hairy Head (Maotou), Celestial Blade (Tianren), Celestial Beauty (Tianyao) move sequentially through *Chou*; Celestial Punishment (Tianxing) moves sequentially through *You*; Celestial Lament (Tianku) aligns with the Grand Year Star (Taisui).

**Sequential Arrangement of Flow Years**
When the Grand Year Star presses inauspiciously into the chart, dreams drift into Southern Branch; the flow year meets with baleful stars in the current year—strange as tumbleweeds in dew.

**Flow Years in Sequence**
First: Grand Year Star (Taisui)
Second: Grand Yang (Taiyang)
Third: Gate of Mourning (Sangmen)
Fourth: Grand Yin (Taiyin)
Fifth: Official Talisman (Guanfu)
Sixth: Death Talisman (Sifu)
Seventh: Year Breaker (Suipo)
Eighth: Dragon Virtue (Longde)
Ninth: White Tiger (Baihu)
Tenth: Fortune Star (Fuxing)
Eleventh: Hanging Guest (Diaoke)
Twelfth: Sickness Talisman (Bingfu)

**Eighteen Baleful Stars Across the Twelve Palaces (Verse)**
From *Zi*, proceed in direct and retrograde motion,
Count to the birth month to place the Staff.
Anomaly, Hair, Blade follow retrograde after the Staff;
Where the birth year aligns, the Lament Star stands beside.

The Staff Star begins in the palace of the birth hour,
Count forward to *Mao* to fix the Destiny.
From the Staff, commence with the first,
Regardless of yin or yang, male or female—retrograde.

Two and a half days traverse one palace,
Count to the birth day to lodge the Body Palace.
Again from *Wei*, count forward to *Zi*;
Where the birth year is met, lay Purple Tenuity.

Void, Nobility, Seal, Longevity follow in retrograde,
Empty Bird, Treasury, Thread, Literary Brilliance, Fortune, Emolument.
Punishment in *You*, Beauty in *Chou*—all move sequentially,
Count to the birth month to locate their stars.

All stars thus arrayed,
Fortune and misfortune are weighed from the outset.

**Method for Locating Purple Tenuity**
To locate Purple Tenuity, Void, Nobility, Seal, Longevity, Empty Bird, Red Bird, Treasury, Thread, Literary Brilliance, Fortune, and Emolument:
Begin at *Wei*, start with *Zi*, count forward to the native’s birth year, then place Purple Tenuity in retrograde, one star per palace.
*Example*: For one born in the year of *Yin*, begin at *Wei* with *Zi*, count forward to *You*, then place Purple Tenuity in retrograde, followed by Void, Nobility, and Seal in like manner.

**Method for Locating Celestial Staff**
To locate Celestial Staff, Anomaly, Hair, and Blade:
Begin at *Zi* with the first month, count in retrograde to the birth month to place the Staff, then lay Anomaly, Hair, and Blade in retrograde.
*Example*: For one born in the first month, place the Staff at *Zi*, Anomaly at *Hai*, Hair at *Xu*, and Blade at *You*. Proceed accordingly.

**Method for Locating Celestial Punishment**
To locate Celestial Punishment:
Begin at *You* with the first month, count forward to the birth month to place Celestial Punishment.

**Method for Locating Celestial Lament**
To locate Celestial Lament:
Align it with the palace that harmonizes with the birth year.
*Example*: For one born in the year of *Zi*, which harmonizes with *Chou*, place the Lament at *Chou*.

**Method for Locating Destiny**
From the Staff Star, count forward to the native’s birth hour. If the birth hour is the Seal hour, begin at *Zi* with *Shen*, count forward to *Wei* to meet *Mao*—this is the Destiny Palace.

**Method for Locating the Body**
From the Staff, count in retrograde—one palace per two and a half days, two palaces per five days—until reaching the birth day to fix the Body, regardless of gender.
*Example*: For the third, thirteenth, or twenty-third day, or the eighth, eighteenth, or twenty-eighth day, if the hour is *Wu*, it does not pass the palace; if *Wei*, it does.

**Method for Locating the Major Limit**
For yang males and yin females, count forward from the Destiny Palace, one palace per decade.
For yin males and yang females, count in retrograde from the *Shen* Palace, one palace per decade.

**Method for Locating the Minor Cycle**
For yang males and yin females, count in retrograde from the *Shen* Palace, one palace per year.
For yin males and yang females, count forward from the Destiny or Body Palace, one palace per year.

**Yin and Yang of the Ten Celestial Stems**
*Jia*, *Bing*, *Wu*, *Geng*, and *Ren* are yang; *Yi*, *Ding*, *Ji*, *Xin*, and *Gui* are yin.

**On Major and Minor Limits**
When the limit traverses a perilous or fallen palace, and baleful stars converge, calamity arrives.
Further reckon the flow year and month—even if death does not come, talent is impaired.

**Sequential Arrangement of Flow Years (Repeated)**
First: Grand Year Star
Second: Grand Yang
Third: Gate of Mourning
Fourth: Grand Yin
Fifth: Official Talisman
Sixth: Death Talisman
Seventh: Year Breaker
Eighth: Dragon Virtue
Ninth: White Tiger
Tenth: Fortune Star
Eleventh: Hanging Guest
Twelfth: Sickness Talisman

**Formula for Determining Life and Death**
The stars govern regions where fortune and misfortune may be discerned; predicting life and death is most difficult.
For adults, first observe Celestial Lament, then note where Celestial Void resides and which palaces the Body and Destiny occupy.
If Celestial Lament directly occupies the Body or Destiny Palace, and Celestial Void shares the same position, with benevolent stars lacking strength, the native will die within three to five years—some within two days.
If the two stars appear in the Destiny but not the Body, or the Body but not the Destiny, death comes within a few years.
If the Body or Destiny receives aid from benevolent stars, death occurs only when the limit is exhausted.
Further observe if Punishment or Blade oppose or align—if so, death is violent and without good end.
The same applies to limit traversal; the judgment is unerring.
*Example*: If the Destiny is in Leo, and the limit reaches the palace where Celestial Lament resides in Aquarius, opposing the limit year *Wei*, death may be predicted. It must wait until the subsequent cycle reaches the *Zi* Palace to confirm.
If Celestial Lament is in Sagittarius’ *Yin* Palace, and the limit also reaches Sagittarius’ *Yin* Palace, death may be predicted—or perhaps a rebirth.
If the flow year converges with the Destiny Palace, and auspicious stars lend support, it is favorable.
For matters of fulfillment, judge only by the Lament Star; when the limit reaches Celestial Void, death may be predicted. The rest follows accordingly.
Celestial Void governs mourning; if benevolent stars intervene, the misfortune may be averted.
Celestial Lament, even with auspicious stars, cannot escape the fate of death when the limit is exhausted.
If it dwells with baleful stars, death comes as soon as the limit is entered.
Only Celestial Longevity, when present, can extend life.
Yet even with the aid of hidden virtue, its power to prolong life does not exceed the nine yang numbers.

One account of baleful limits states: if the Celestial Blade star is absent, and the limit reaches a palace where it is enshrined or at peak power, a family member will surely shed tears. The same holds when Celestial Void arrives at its limit. Celestial Staff, regardless of whether it resides in a temple or radiant palace, also brings mourning garb. Should the Celestial Wanderer or Weeping Star ascend to the throne, death may likewise be predicted.

An ancient verse says:
A guest arrives, and zither and books are set aside;
Even a child might sketch this scene.
When power and influence are forgotten, righteousness weighs heavy;
Golden bonds of friendship are forged in shared purpose.
Amid osmanthus fragrance, the scholar toils;
Before the jeweled-tree hall, the traveler’s carriage halts.
Now Guan and Liu are met again,
Their names fragrant for a thousand years, spread through the countryside.

Yet when carbuncles and ulcers fester and burst, the great fate follows—meeting with overturned wheels, yet still lost in confusion.

The Nine Yang Stars determine the weight of fortune and misfortune:
Purple Wood, Literary Wood, Fortune Earth, Emolument Wood, Seal Earth, Longevity Earth, Staff Wood, Treasury Earth, and Yao Wood.
When in yang palaces, fortune is heavy and calamity light;
When in yin palaces, fortune is light and calamity heavy.

The Nine Yin Stars likewise divide the weight of misfortune and fortune:
Noble Earth, Crimson Metal, Strange Earth, Hair Water, Void Water, Thread Earth, Punishment Fire, Blade Metal, and Weeping Metal.
When in yin palaces, fortune is heavy and calamity light;
When in yang palaces, calamity is heavy and fortune light.
How could one not examine this with care?
Yet if they reside in temples or flourish in prosperous palaces, one need not be bound by yin and yang.

The Three Terraces Entering the Seat
These two stars are the *qi* of the Purple Spirit, wielding the authority of the Northern Dipper. They govern the pure and noble constellations of celestial mechanisms, presiding over literary success, official advancement, and auspicious blessings. When one’s fate aligns with solitary numbers, they become the deities of Left Auxiliary and Right Assistant, known as the Three Harmonies and Eight Seats.

If they illuminate the Wife Palace, it portends separation or harm; the same applies to the Heavenly Palace. When these two stars shine upon a person’s life or fate, or upon the limit, it is most auspicious—a sign of great nobility and unimpeded success.

For the Three Terraces star:
For men and women, begin at the *xu* (11th) position, count forward from the first month to the month of birth, then count from one to the day of birth.

For the Eight Seats star:
For men and women, begin at the *chen* (5th) position, count forward from the first month to the month of birth, then count from one to the day of birth.

Dragon Pond and Phoenix Pavilion
These two stars are the celestial overseers of literary brilliance, remnants of the Metal Star, governing literary honors and scholarly success. When present in a person’s fate, they bestow refinement, cleverness, elegance, and gentle goodness. For men and women alike, they bring the chance to ride dragons and attach to phoenixes, achieving illustrious rank, abundant wealth, and ample emolument. For women, they confer exceptional beauty, versatile talents, and a heart unmoved by wanton desires. If in a weak palace, their influence is slight; if in a strong palace, their fortune is profound.

For Dragon Pond:
For men and women, begin at the *chen* (5th) position, count forward from the *zi* (1st) hour to the hour of birth.

For Phoenix Pavilion:
For men and women, begin at the *xu* (11th) position, count backward from the *zi* (1st) hour to the hour of birth.

These eighteen stars have their own configurations, and beyond them lie greater patterns, now selected as follows:

If a person’s Life and Destiny Palaces reside in *hai* (12th) or *zi* (1st), and the stars do not enter their temples, it is called the "Body Drowned in Rivers and Lakes" pattern.
For men and women in *xu* (11th), *hai* (12th), *chen* (5th), or *si* (6th), it is called the "Child’s Head Enmeshed in a Net" pattern.
If the Life Palace is in *si* (6th), it is called the "Body Entering the Poor Folk" pattern, portending the loss of a spouse.
If the Destiny rests upon the Blade, it is called the "Grinding Candle as Destiny" pattern, marked by frequent success and failure.
When Celestial Blade and Celestial Void reside in *mao* (4th), it is called the "Destiny Seated at the Gate of Wealth" pattern.
As for baleful influences that do not prove baleful, there are always auspicious matters to mitigate them.

If a person is born in the *mao* (4th) hour with their Destiny seated in the *mao* (4th) palace, it is called "Serpent Entering the Dragon’s Palace"—regardless of the time, all born with their Destiny in *mao* (4th) are auspicious.

The Seven Strong Palaces
When auspicious stars descend and reside, the Fortune Palace becomes a palace of blessing. The fields and dwellings, wife and concubines, and official emolument palaces are of the highest strength; for men and women, the Virtue Palace is next in strength, followed by the Talent and Wealth Palace as nearly strong.

The Five Strong Palaces
Appearance and servants are of ill weakness; if further debilitated, the Brothers Palace is half-debased, also called the "Idle Palace." Illness and misfortune, migration and movement are of secondary weakness; baleful stars residing in temples are considered extraordinary.

The Nine Auspicious Stars Entering Temples (Example)
Purple, Literary, Crimson, Noble, Fortune, Green, Seal, Longevity, and Treasury—if just three to five of these shine upon a strong palace, they bestow honor and nobility.
Literary Brilliance and Celestial Nobility govern scholarly fame and literary distinction, mastery of classics and canons.
Celestial Punishment delighting in the Heavenly Treasury, residing in the Life Palace and illuminating the body, along with four strong palaces, must indicate a person of true talent and solid virtue, one who rises above the crowd.

The Nine Baleful Stars Entering Temples (Example)
Punishment, Strange, Blade, Staff, Void, Weeping, Hair, and Yao.
When baleful stars reside in temples and flourish, illuminating the body and fate, they bring fortune. If they do not reside in temples or flourish, they bring misfortune.
Celestial Punishment residing in a temple transforms into a star of literary elegance, governing talent and learning.
Celestial Blade entering a temple governs the accumulation of grain and may also govern avarice, vanity, and the depletion of talent and wealth. One’s fate and limit should not encounter Punishment and Blade.
When Void and Weeping illuminate the Life and Destiny Palaces, they harm the wives and concubines of men and women. If they enter temples and flourish, scholars may die before their time.
Hair Head and Void Depletion are taboo when illuminating the Talent and Wealth or Wife and Concubines Palaces, as they bring harm to wives and great loss of talent and wealth. When baleful stars bring misfortune, one must weigh whether the baleful outweighs the auspicious.

Limit Verse for Refined Judgment
Heaven hangs its images, earth forms its shapes;
Who can fathom the rise and fall of human affairs?
First examine the limits for passage or blockage,
Then observe the stars for withering or flourishing.
The Life Palace and Official Emolument are strongest;
For men and women, migration and harmony align with the Three Harmonies.
Parents should be exalted, flanked by wives and concubines;
Nearly strong are wealth and talent, illness and fortune.

Hexagram Statement
The Three Palaces of Brothers are called "Idle Extremes";
Ill weakness must still be borne by servants.

Should one’s appearance be ill-favored or weak, take careful note—
the rest need not be pondered with painful deliberation.

**Verse on Judging the Limit Cycles**
The limit cycles and years bear their own ebb and flow;
when the limit flows freely, the self is naturally auspicious.
Even if the year’s stars turn baleful,
what care for minor calamities and misfortunes?

**Hexagram Statement**
Conjoined with Blade and Punishment stars, one must suffer the machinations of punishment.
When Void Wailing and Residual Dew stars arise, songs of lament follow.
When the great limit nears its end,
Void Wailing in the natal palace reveals the Blade’s presence.
Though auspicious stars may shine upon the year,
trust only in ten deaths for every single life.

**Life Palace**
Favorable are the stars of fortune and emolument;
if they align with one’s later years, old age brings ease, bounty, and freedom from illness.
With the aid of auspicious stars, they govern three destinies:
first, wealth; second, longevity; third, nobility.
Thus, when body and fate encounter them, they bring authority and seals of office.
Should the body and fate palaces be afflicted by Punishment, Strangeness, Wailing, Blade, or Yao stars,
the limbs will surely suffer loss or injury.
The Blade harms the self, Punishment wounds the body;
otherwise, one may lose a foot, break an arm, or suffer chronic ailments of the ears, nose, or eyes—
even dimness of vision.
If body and fate encounter Void (Tiankong) or Heaven’s Center (Tianzhong),
the household will be impoverished, its livelihood melting like snow,
reducing one to clinging to the rafters and enduring hunger.
As the classic states: *"When body and fate meet the Four Voids, one becomes either a Daoist or a monk."*
With baleful stars converging in aspect, the judgment is lifelong solitude.

**Literary Star in the Life Palace brings intelligence**
As the classic states: *"When the Literary Star flourishes and is aided by worthy ministers, one becomes a black-haired prime minister."*
Fate aligned with the star of literary halls.

**Fortune and Emolument stars in the palace bring wealth and honor**
As the classic states: *"When fortune and emolument follow the proper course, achievements surpass the age."*
The nobleman sees this as a seal, his fame secured in a single stroke.
The commoner sees it as an extraordinary rise.

**Nobility and Longevity stars assist, ensuring lasting wealth and honor**
Nobility brings fame through the stroke of a pen; longevity brings emolument through long life.

**Purple and Red stars, seals and staffs—all mediocre**
Though the Purple Tenuity brings a hundred blessings, and authority and seals follow the Red Glance,
wealth and honor are as fleeting as floating clouds, while staffs bring indecision in advancement and retreat.

**Tianyao reveals a life of excessive desire**
A man’s early years are consumed by lust, for his fate is afflicted by Tianyao.
A woman who slips out at midnight for illicit trysts
does so because Tianyao resides in her fate palace.

**Punishment and Strangeness stars bring the ruin of ancestral estates**
When Punishment and Strangeness converge, there is surely lament for rise and fall;
without the grace of fortune, emolument, or official rank.

**Tianku (Heavenly Treasury) in aspect brings great wealth**
As the classic states: *"When body and fate reside in the Treasury, boundless wealth accumulates.
If the Treasury star moves alone through the fate palace, abundance is assured."*

**Tianxu (Heavenly Void) ensures all undertakings fail**
As the classic states: *"This marks a man of empty show.
His deeds are like rowing against the current, and he often encounters Daoists and monks."*

**Maotou and Blood Blade stars are baleful in aspect**
If the Life Palace encounters Maotou, one will never transcend.

**Wailing Star in aspect brings mourning for kin**
Though the blue robe is within grasp, official misfortune follows close behind.
Only with the aid of auspicious stars can one be spared;
opposing aspects and clashes reveal fortune and misfortune clearly.

**Wealth and Silk Palace**
Favorable is the Tianku star.
When the Treasury guards fields and wealth, one becomes a wealthy lord;
if the Treasury star moves humbly through the fate palace, abundance is assured.

**Tianguan (Heavenly Pass)**
When the limit cycle or fate palace encounters this, one gains unexpected wealth.

**Purple Tenuity, Red Bird, Heavenly Longevity—when in exaltation and aspecting Wealth and Silk—all bring wealth.**
When the Heavenly Nobility meets the Pass star, great riches follow.
A life of sufficiency in wealth and honor.

**Seal stars in aspect with the Pass bring fame.**
**Tianku (Heavenly Treasury)**—wealth abhors clashes or breaks.
The master of wealth returns to the nest without cease.

**Pass Star**—constantly gains unexpected wealth.

**Tianfu (Heavenly Fortune)**—wealth and silk are abundant, ensuring granaries filled with grain.

**Wenchang (Literary Prosperity)**—wealth and silk meet their aids, bringing prosperity to the whole household.

**Tiangui (Heavenly Nobility)**—officials bring wealth and honor, further enhancing reputation.

**Tianxu (Heavenly Void)**—wealth and silk advance and retreat.

**Tianku (Heavenly Wailing)**—losses and expenditures enter.

**Husband and Staff stars in aspect**
Though the household may amass a thousand gold pieces, it will inevitably suffer midway losses.

**Tianyi (Heavenly Strangeness) star in aspect**
No benefit from risky or heartless schemes; ill-gotten gains.

**Tianku (Heavenly Wailing) star in aspect**—great financial losses.
Gains slip away as swiftly as they come, like bubbles on water or flowers before the eyes.

**Tianren (Heavenly Blade) star in aspect**—wealth is as fleeting as floating clouds.

**Maotou star in aspect**—ultimately empty, frequently beset by thieves.

**Tianxing (Heavenly Punishment) star in aspect**—wealth is illusory, used for private gain under public pretext.

**Tianyao star in aspect**—wealth often lost to flowers, wine, and gambling;
excess leads to stagnation, stagnation to emptiness, punishment to loss, poverty to theft, and official entanglements to financial ruin.

**Tianren (Heavenly Blade) star in aspect with wealth**—beneficial.
When Treasury and Pass stars bring unexpected wealth,
if the limit cycle aligns, one must keep it secret.
If baleful stars reside here, any accumulated wealth will ultimately fail.

**When auspicious stars reside in the Wealth and Silk Palace, and the Pass and Treasury stars are in aspect, blessings are especially great.**
Otherwise, if Yao or Strangeness stars aspect it,
a lifetime of endeavors will know many successes and failures.

**When the Tianku (Heavenly Treasury) star passes through the Wealth and Silk Palace, and the Pass Star is added without calamity,**
if Punishment or Strangeness stars aspect this palace,
a lifetime’s fate will know many successes and failures.

**When Purple, Fortune, and Longevity stars bring auspiciousness to the Wealth and Silk Palace, and the Pass Star is in aspect, great prosperity follows.**
Nobility, Seal, Emolument, and Fortune stars bring sufficiency in wealth;
Red, Literary, Strangeness, and Staff stars also bring stability.

**Brothers Palace**
Favorable are flourishing and auspicious stars in aspect, bringing harmonious brothers and wealth;
it is most unfavorable to be afflicted or drowned.

**Purple star**—three brothers in harmony.

**Void star**—prone to disputes, unfavorable for Punishment.

**Nobility star**—brothers form a line.

**Mao and Nobility stars**—illustrious.

**Red star**—can be summoned.

**Purple star**—three brothers in harmony.

**Tianxu (Heavenly Void)**—leads to quarrels and frequent Punishment.

**Tiangui (Heavenly Nobility)**—brothers form a line.

**Tianyin (Heavenly Seal)**—brothers achieve noble prominence.

**Tianshou (Heavenly Longevity)**—siblings flourish together in longevity.

**Tiankong (Heavenly Void)**—siblings are of little help; one must rely on one’s children.

**Hongluan (Red Bird)**—affectionate and can be summoned.

**Tianku (Heavenly Treasury)**—provides support.

**Tianguan (Heavenly Pass)**—does not form a line.

**Wenchang (Literary Prosperity)**—draws close to the noble.

**Tianfu (Heavenly Fortune)**—possesses loyalty and deference.

**Tianlu (Heavenly Emolument)**—all attain fame and emolument.

**Heavenly Staff**—true division, affection grows thin.

**Heavenly Anomaly**—harmony only if contracts differ.

**Mao Head**—without it, quarrels and strife arise.

**Heavenly Blade**—severe harm and restraint; rely on one’s children.

If **Longevity** is encroached upon, it is not inauspicious; if stars clash, **Treasury** provides support.

**Pass**—wild geese do not form a line.

**Literary Prosperity**—draws near to the noble and fosters kinship.

**Fortune**—becomes wealthy, possesses loyalty and deference.

**Emolument**—fame and emolument.

**Staff**—true division.

**Anomaly**—contracts differ.

**Mao**—without it, strife and quarrels arise.

**Punishment**—disharmony, strife, and punishment.

**Yao Blade**—weeping and wailing, harm prevails; if the division is great, rely on one’s children.

The song says:
Within the **Brothers Palace**, noble and base divide,
**Void, Anomaly, Punishment, Yao**—none are gladly seen.
If **Heavenly Nobility** and **Red Bird** appear,
Wild geese form a line—how enviable the scene!

If **Heavenly Anomaly** resides in the **Brothers** position,
Brothers must live apart.
Though they share an ancestral home,
In the end, they part ways.

**Heavenly Anomaly** in the **Brothers** place
Demands they be born of different mothers.
Even if they dwell under one roof,
Strife and quarrels will persist.

**Void, Weeping, Yao, Punishment**—none heed reason,
Strange omens arise from the stars.
If **Red Bird** and **Heavenly Nobility** appear,
A line forms, like crows alighting, in kinship they gather.

Brothers should meet **Seal** and **Longevity**’s prosperity,
If they encounter **Yao** or **Anomaly**, daughters will be many.
**Red Bird, Literary Prosperity, Anomaly, Staff**—all take precedence,
But what of **Weeping, Blade, Mao, Punishment**? Alas, what can be done?

**Fourth: The Palace of Fields and Dwellings**
Favor **Pass** and **Treasury** when stars are in exaltation or vigor;
**Heavenly Anomaly** is inauspicious—parents die young.
If **Treasury** and **Heavenly Intent** shine together,
First ruin, then success—this is a fate of self-reliance.

**Purple, Nobility, Seal, Ancestral Fruit**—abundant.
**Fortune, Treasury, Talent**—if above flourish, much evil harms the father.

**Pass** with **Talent**—avoid clashes and ruptures.

**Longevity**—level.

**Red**—fields and dwellings flourish; **Literary Prosperity, Emolument**—abundant grain.

**Void, Staff, Blade**—first enjoy blessings.

**Anomaly**—breaks ancestral ties.

**Mao**—often breaks, often succeeds.

**Yao**—breaks ancestral ties.

**Punishment**—self-destruction, self-achievement.

**Weeping** combined with **Treasury** or **Pass**—first ruin, then success; if in exaltation or vigor, property surpasses ancestral fields.

**Void**—self-achievement, self-reliance.

Fields and dwellings meeting **Mao, Void, Anomaly**—
Ancestral property and talent vanish like dust.
If **Treasury** or **Pass** shine upon the self,
First ruin, then success—one establishes anew.

**Fortune, Emolument, Seal, Longevity**—many fields and dwellings.
**Yao, Mao, Punishment, Anomaly**—parents’ burdens weigh heavy.
First ruin, then success—**Seal** breaking is auspicious.
**Heavenly Void**—fields and dwellings come to naught.

**Fifth: The Palace of Sons and Daughters**
The poem says: In the five positions, life abounds,
Children and grandchildren fill the eye.
Yet male and female stars should not shine here,
For they bring misfortune—**Weeping, Void** too cause early death, many do not survive.

**Three Days’ Office**—in high and strong positions, good for generating **Fortune** and **Emolument**.

The body traverses degrees—twins;
The moon in inauspicious traversal—two share the breast.

**Purple**—one or two children, first daughter, then son;
In exaltation or vigor, children and grandchildren are noble and flourishing;
In prosperous places, four or five children form a line.

**Nobility**—two or three children, glory for posterity.

**Void**—in old age, no children, or none survive;
Otherwise, drifting in foreign lands.
Only adopted children bring joy.
If not, children suffer illness.

**Treasury, Longevity, Seal, Pass**—children bring honor to the family.

**Red**—many daughters, few sons survive.

**Fortune, Literary Prosperity**—three to five children, wealth and nobility;
Avoid clashes and ruptures.

**Emolument**—brings glory, children who change the family’s reputation.

**Staff**—children do not survive, or barely do.

**Weeping**—harm and loss; one or two may see one through to the end.

**Anomaly**—estranged nurturing; children are hard to come by;
One may be raised by a relative, or else an adopted child.

**Mao**—male and female children cause ancestral violence and violent death;
If favorably placed, children bring blessings.

**Blade**—children suffer illness, break the family estate;
Avoid harm and loss—adopted children are the exception.

**Yao**—male and female children are of little help, drifting;
Sons are unruly, daughters impure.

**Punishment**—children are as if absent, unfilial.
If auspicious stars share the palace,
One in three children may see one through to the end.
If the three harmonies meet with evil stars, none are born;
Male and female children are adopted.
Women suffer birth calamities.

**Pass**—two or three children survive.

The poem says:

**Mao**—must not reside over sons and daughters;
Children and daughters-in-law are born like raging tigers.
If encountering Celestial Nobility or Red Phoenix,
Descendants will naturally rise in glory.

**Mao** with Punishment and Blade is fiercely violent;
If Void and Weeping converge, it bodes ill fate.
Should both palaces be graced by auspicious stars,
Servants and descendants will know joy and ease.

**Four Malefics** with Punishment and Flesh—within the womb, deformity is certain.
**Anomaly**—anomalous star governs anomalous births;
If it falls upon progeny, discord follows.
Miscarriages and stepchildren are but trifling matters—
Even a wife’s elder brother may bring them forth.

**Three Punishments** clash with life—before birth, the mother’s body is surely harmed.
**Literary Brilliance** yields many children, though Purple and Red are sparse;
The eldest son is hard to come by, and the staff is but an empty token.
**Seal** and **Longevity** stars beget two sons;
**Fortune** star’s sons and daughters are also worthy of esteem.

**Sixth Palace of Servants**
Must not see **Literary Brilliance**—such a one is less wise than their servants.
**Celestial Blade** and **Celestial Staff** govern strong servants.
If **Weeping** and **Void** appear, banditry is no concern.
**Purple** is difficult to manage.
**Staff**, **Blade**, **Longevity**, **Fortune**, **Weeping**, **Pass**, **Red**, and **Emolument**—servants stand in awe.
**Literary** and **Void**—intelligence cannot distinguish servants.
**Nobility** and **Seal** must not secretly advance or flee.
**Mao** and **Punishment**—servants are fierce and malicious by nature.
**Yao** and **Anomaly**—maidservants prove capable.
If the **Servant Palace** is weak, they follow their mother upon marriage;
At the time of betrothal, they must be exchanged or held by the father.
**Purple** and **Literary** are ill-suited for servants;
**Void** star’s wisdom is inferior to that of servants.
If encountering **Staff** and **Blade**, they prove capable;
**Celestial Punishment** and **Mao**—servants are absent.
**Yao** and **Anomaly**—maidservants are dependable;
**Storehouse** and **Emolument** attract many able servants.

**Seventh Palace of Wives and Concubines**
Should **Red Phoenix** and **Celestial Nobility** shine upon it,
One gains a beautiful and noble wife, along with servants and maids.
Must not see **Celestial Anomaly**—it foretells separation,
Or caution against loss, leading to remarriage.
**Purple** in the court brings a wife of noble appearance.
If debilitated, she is wanton and dissolute.
A woman who marries peacefully is often one who cultivates the Dao,
Practices virtue, and reaps good karma.
Both men and women possess decisiveness.
**Void** governs loss and harm—delay marriage to avoid misfortune.
It may also mean no wife, or many encounters with monks and Daoists.
**Nobility** brings a wife of beauty and purity.
**Seal** gains wealth through his wife; with **Staff**, they do not age together.
**Longevity** suits elderly couples.
**Void** and **Wood** are auspicious.
**Red** brings a wife of lovely countenance.
**Storehouse** gains wives and concubines, though not in old age.
**Emolument** brings a noble wife, but shuns inauspicious stars in opposition.
**Literary** brings a wife of wit and cleverness;
If **Hanging** and the three directions are afflicted by malefics, caution is needed.
**Pass** governs a wife of improper conduct for men,
And a husband of poor character for women.
In the positions of **Si**, **Wu**, **Jia**, and **Hai**, there is no sorrow—
It also signifies a wife of talent.
**Fortune** brings a virtuous and kind wife,
But if afflicted by **Anomaly** or **Punishment**, it is inauspicious.
**Staff** brings solitary or sickly spouses.
**Mao** harms and clashes with a strong-willed wife.
**Anomaly** harms two or three, and discord prevails—
Otherwise, it portends separation.
It may also indicate remarriage, which is ill for both men and women.
**Blade**—men are harmed by wine and lust, women face peril in childbirth.
It also brings hardship, neglect, and frequent harm.
**Punishment** brings harm and loss—delaying may avert it.
**Celestial Staff**—couples suffer many illnesses and worries, and must guard against favored concubines.
**Yao** with remarriage also brings harmony.
But if **Staff**, **Anomaly**, and malefics converge, it foretells separation in life or death.
If in an exalted position or encountered in favorable years, it adds longevity,
And harmonious affairs bring contentment.
**Weeping** often brings punishment and calamity.

The poem says:
In the seventh palace, free of malefics,
Lute and zither harmonize in song.
If husband and wife part ways, their paths diverge—
Yet if Red Phoenix and Nobility favor them,
A virtuous wife and noble sons bring stability;
Weeping stars here bring only sorrow.
Nobility, Seal, and Longevity make for good spouses;
Void, Blade, Mao, and Punishment bring harm.
If the three directions meet with malefics,
Remarriage two or three times is likely.
Punishment, Void, Mao, and Blade bring multiple wives—
Only Red Phoenix grants a wife of rare beauty.
Nobility, Yao, Storehouse, and Emolument bring wives of talent;
Celestial Anomaly foretells separation or estrangement.

**Eighth Palace of Illness and Calamity**
Must not see **Yao** or **Anomaly** stars—
They bring hunchbacks, stooped backs, and severe foot ailments.
○ **Purple**, **Void**, **Nobility**, **Longevity**, **Yao**, **Mao**, **Void**
**Anomaly**—chronic illness, afflictions of the eyes, hands, and feet,
Lung congestion, wheezing, and constant coughing.
○ **Seal**, **Red**, **Storehouse**, **Pass**, **Literary**, **Blade**—**Fortune** and **Emolument**
○ **Yao** and **Weeping**—internal organs are unsettled,
Bringing hunchbacks and lame feet.
If the **Palace of Illness and Calamity** at birth aligns with **Human** and **Horse**,
Or shares the same region as the **Ghost Gate**,
And is debilitated or afflicted by **Blade**, **Anomaly**, or **Punishment**,
The harm extends to the **Wings**, leading to muteness.
**Blade** and **Punishment** in the **Palace of Illness and Calamity** are feared—
The five organs rebel, and treatment is ineffective.
Lame feet, hunchbacks, and stooped backs,
Year after year, weeping and illness are inevitable.
Where does the **Body Star** fall into debility?
If it meets malefics, it is most inauspicious.
If the **Eight Malefics** converge and shine upon it,
One knows the essence and vitality will surely be harmed.
The **Palace of Illness and Calamity** must not see **Celestial Yao**—
**Anomaly** star brings strange and perplexing troubles.
**Punishment** and **Blade** bring frequent illness;
**Celestial Nobility** and **Literary Brilliance** may mitigate them.
**Yao**, **Anomaly**, **Mao**, and **Punishment** bring chronic ailments;
Relying on minor **Fortune** and **Longevity** averts disaster.
Auspicious and inauspicious stars intermingle—examine closely;
If malefics approach, misfortune follows.

**Ninth Palace of Migration**
Must not see **Mao**, **Punishment**, or **Blade** shining upon it—
Traveling abroad brings risks of bandits and violent perils,
In severe cases, even death; observe whether benevolent stars offer salvation.
**Purple**—traveling and residing abroad brings proximity to nobility.
**Void**—leaving one’s homeland enhances talent.
**Seal**—abroad, one gains talent and emolument.
**Nobility**—traveling and residing abroad brings the aid of noble persons.
**Longevity**—traveling abroad is auspicious.
**Storehouse** and **Pass**—abroad, one gains talent and good fortune.
**Red**—abroad, one enjoys talent and joyous occasions;
Meeting the **Three Harmonies** brings auspicious talent—
This pertains to the nine schools of Confucianism and the various arts.
**Literary**—traveling and residing abroad brings proximity to nobility and good fortune.
**Fortune**—migration brings success;
Meeting the **Three Harmonies** with auspicious stars, one travels as they please.
**Emolument**—often encounters high nobility.
**Staff**—traveling and residing abroad are inauspicious.
**Mao**—on the road, one encounters bandits, harm, and violent misfortune,
And may also face water-related calamities.
**Anomaly**—one finds no peace or tranquility.
**Yao**—traveling and residing abroad bring harmony with others.
**Blade**—distant journeys attract bandits.
**Punishment**—distant journeys are inauspicious;
If **Celestial Weeping** is encountered, bandits and violent misfortunes follow.

Weeping—distant journeys and travel bring much quarreling, slander, and strife.
Void—all affairs come to naught.

**Song:**
When moving or traveling, if Punishment and Blade meet Mao,
One must encounter thieves and robbers on the road.
If no auspicious stars come to the rescue of an unnatural death,
Only without malevolent stars need one have no worry.

When Celestial Nobility wanders and travels, one frequently meets the noble;
Seal, Vegetation, Fortune, and Emolument may draw near.
Though Mao, Punishment, and Blade guard in vain against thieves,
One may yet become a wandering ghost in a foreign land.

**Palace of the Ten Officials and Emolument**
It is auspicious to see Seal, Ribbon, and Literary Brilliance—
One attains scholarly rank at the imperial examination.
If in a temple or at its peak, one holds high office and is promoted.
If Void Star appears, one’s life lacks emolument.

When Purple Name returns to the Golden Bowl and enters the temple,
One’s fame reaches the imperial ear, and life flows without cease,
Unentangled in strife.
If meeting Phoenix in youth, one passes the examination;
If broken by opposition, one does not attain nobility.

Void brings an empty reputation—
A strange person whose power is naturally indecisive.
Nobility—when meeting affairs, one fears nothing;
Without malevolence, one’s life is peaceful and secure.

Seal—one can govern the household,
Further gains land, and with mutual resonance of Celestial Nobility,
One is destined to be a general, enfeoffed as a marquis—
A life of great nobility.
If in youth one passes the examination, one early wields banners;
If a commoner does not gain land, one still lives in tranquility.

Longevity entering the temple—
In youth, one passes the imperial examination,
Compassionate toward the multitude, seeing affairs from afar.
Emolument is as above.

Red possesses benevolence and righteousness—
One gains felicity, delights in propriety, and avoids recklessness.
Treasury—good at planning, talent, and calculation;
Entering the temple, one’s name spreads among Chinese and barbarians.

Linked—throughout life, one is kind and decisive;
If broken, it is inauspicious.
Mao—undaunted by affairs, one is not afraid of being slighted.

Weeping removes literary grace.
Literary entering the temple—
In youth, one attains scholarly rank, holds a banner and staff,
A gentleman of pure office, or a monk or Daoist of purity;
A commoner draws near to the noble.

Yao—easily provoked to evil, one must guard one’s words;
Many affairs, many words.

**Poem:**
When in the Palace of Celestial Emolument, Punishment and Staff shine,
Exile and penal servitude are not worth mentioning.
If Celestial Weeping further strikes in opposition,
One dies in penal servitude, wounded or perished—misfortune visits itself.

Of official emolument, Punishment and Blade cannot be spoken;
Imprisonment and litigation entangle, calamities connect.
If Celestial Seal and Literary Brilliance reside in this place,
In youth, one gains high promotion in an unexpected land.

Official emolument must meet Seal and Noble Star;
Staff, Micro, Red, and Longevity are all mediocre.
Celestial Void, Punishment, and Blade bring no substantial achievement;
Only if meeting Literary Brilliance does one’s great name spread.

**Palace of the Eleven Fortunes and Virtues**
It is auspicious to see Fortune, Longevity, and Seal—auspicious stars;
Further auspicious if in a temple or at its peak.
If common Void Star shines and breaks it, one’s life lacks fortune,
Or falls into ruin.

If Punishment and Blade approach,
One must suffer deafness, blindness, goiter, or tumors.
Purple, Longevity, and Red—throughout life, clothing and food are secure and peaceful.
Nobility and Literary—clothing and emolument are pure and abundant.

Seal spreads one’s name.
Treasury—wealth and emolument.
Linked—unconventional talent.
Fortune—firm and steadfast.
Emolument—official emolument.

Staff and Anomaly—laborious, toiling, advancing and retreating.
Mao, Yao, Blade, and Weeping—one’s fortune is meager and inauspicious.
Void—throughout life, one lacks wealth,
One’s person is in a ruined place;
If further met by Punishment and Blade,
One must suffer illnesses of the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, arms, or feet.

Punishment—labor of the heart, resentment, calamity, and penal servitude.
If Void and Weeping further strike, one is wounded or perishes;
If meeting auspicious stars, half is saved.
Yao—one’s body is disordered, one’s heart is busy.

**Song:**

Fortune and virtue unseen—where Heaven’s Void prevails,
The blessed alone remain untouched by bale.
If Punishment and Anomaly cast their baleful light,
Even without illness, one lives in dread and plight.

When the Body Palace stands pure and auspicious, fret not over fate;
Fortune and virtue, steadfast and lofty, transcend all debate.
The Palace of Fortune and Virtue must host propitious stars,
For youth to enjoy ease and honor, free from scars.

Should malevolent luminaries meet the Seal without grace,
Early loss befalls wife, servants, and brothers in their place.

Twelfth: The Palace of Appearance
Fitting to encounter Void and Weeping—through life, few woes.
Ill-suited for Body and Destiny—if Mao and Heavenly Weeping align,
Disfigurement follows; meeting Nobility brings great fortune benign.
Purple—lone qi.
Nobility—crimson, literary, fair of face.
Seal—authority and might.
Longevity—ancient visage.
Treasury—talent revealed.
Linked—sudden rise.
Void—illness and calamity shun its clash.
Fortune and emolument in exalted palaces—from nothing, glory and wealth amass.

Staff—later affliction and distress.
Yao—fair and refined.
Mao—ugly visage.
Weeping—appearance marred by illness.
Anomaly, Blade, Punishment—disfigurement, affliction, and distress.

**Song:**
The Palace of Appearance must not meet Weeping’s sorrow,
Lest wounds mar the face, a limp shoulder follow.
If this palace encounters such baleful rays,
Illness and misfortune surely blight one’s days.

**Song:**
The Palace of Appearance must not meet Anomaly’s star,
Nor Punishment and Blade draw near from afar.
If Body and Destiny these luminaries behold,
Hidden illness and strange calamities unfold.

**Song:**
The Palace of Appearance with Literary Brilliance is not ideal,
But Fortune and Longevity bestow long years, serene and real.
If inauspicious stars assail, ancestral ties may break,
Red Phoenix and Heavenly Weeping—examine for truth’s sake.

In the Zi, Shen, Si, and You palaces, Purple Qi stands high and strong,
For priests and shamans, a share in lofty destinies belong.
○ Star name: Purple Tenuity, dwelling in Zi’s domain.
For men—halls of learning, academies; for women—embroidery and silk’s artful gain.
Without Mao’s touch, men don crowns and reap emolument’s store;
Without Blade’s reach, women grace noble chambers evermore.
If in Si’s palace, or You and Hai’s course it flows,
Fortune and emolument overflow, and fame bestows.

The Purple Qi’s star, when lone, makes monks, nuns, or wanderers of the way,
Or those who follow after, in its solitary sway.

**Song:**
This star in decline—through life, a scholar old,
Yet if in Zi’s palace Purple Tenuity takes hold,
Wealth, nobility, and renown spread far and wide,
Punishment and Anomaly absent—harmony abides.

**Song:**
Purple Qi returns to its proper sphere,
Master of letters, peerless and clear.
In Hai, You, Zi, and Si’s embrace,
Riches, longevity, talent, and virtue grace.
Clad in purple, girded with gold—none compare,
What fear of rank unadorned or honor rare?

**Song:**
Purple Qi meets Purple Qi—celestial splendor bright,
Auspicious stars conjoin to double its light.
Lone Constellation and Heavenly Opposition idle in their station,
Destined for Daoist or Buddhist vocation.
Body and Destiny meet it—longevity assured,
Purple Qi in glory—bliss is secured.
Nobility and prominence in the imperial court reside,
With Heavenly Blade as aide, a minister’s rank applied.

**Song:**
Purple Qi—artists of leisure, refined,
With Ghost and Net—skill is defined.
Versed in civil and martial arts, strategy profound,
Empty realms bring glory, all things renewed and sound.

Purple Tenuity delights in its central throne,
Wealth and treasure overflow, fortune’s bounty sown.
In the Palace of Children and Destiny, official rank,
Meeting it—elegance and success in all things rank.

Heavenly Void—ice’s essence, Yin’s form in Wu’s noon.
○ Star name: Heavenly Void, meeting Body and Destiny’s boon.
In Yin, Shen, Si, and Hai’s four palaces, wealth is thin,
Yet in Xu, Chou, and Wu—glory and riches begin.
If fallen in officialdom, ruin leaves no trace,
Better to gather idle winds, beneath plum blossoms’ grace,
In paper curtains, alone to sleep in tranquil space.

**Song:**
Heavenly Remainder in Chou and Wu—true wealth and might,
Si, Hai, Yin, Shen—much is empty, slight.
If Mao’s head joins in its gaze,
Fields and gardens vanish in ruin’s haze.

**Song:**
Heavenly Void in Chou and Wu’s position thrives,
In its temple’s glory, no harm survives.
False words and deceitful hearts—heed them not,
For schemes may prosper, riches begot.

**Song:**
Peach and plum in spring’s silent bloom,
Who shares the willow’s verdant plume?
Heavenly Void melts in celestial flame,
Striking wealth and rank—half a life in shame.
If good stars intercede to save,
Half fortune lingers, half misfortune’s wave.

**Song:**
Advance—a mate of equal grace,
Retreat—worldly ties still trace.
Heavenly Void in temple, Body and Destiny’s guest,
Yin and Yang in harmony—bliss is blessed.
Though malevolent stars may join the throng,
Even in success, dust clings to the brow’s song.

Heavenly Nobility—Earth’s essence, Yin’s form in Yin and Chen’s morn.
○ Star of Destiny: Heavenly Nobility, fame and renown are born.
In Yin and Chen’s two palaces, in its rightful place,
Wealth abounds, glory and riches grace,
Servants attend, few calamities arise,
All schemes prosper, a thousandfold life’s prize.

**Song:**
Heavenly Nobility in Yin and Chen shines bright,
Mao’s head conjoined—no splendor in its light.
Staff’s star added—poverty and lowly state,
Like Xuanzhou’s flowering quince—fate’s cruel bait.

**Song:**
Heavenly Nobility—star of temple’s might,
In Shen, Zi, Chen, and Hai’s domains, it takes its flight.
Youth brings elegance, fame’s sweet sound,
Golden lists proclaim, fortune’s blessings abound.

**Song:**
Heavenly Nobility—from emolument and virtue’s claim,
If in Body and Destiny, a palace’s frame,
With Literary and Seal stars nearby to gleam,
It guides one to office, purple robes to seam.

Nobility’s star in temple, in Body and Destiny’s keep,
In its season, fortune and emolument run deep.
Wealth like towering peaks, boundless and grand,
Official rank among the Three Dukes to command.

Heavenly Seal—Yang’s form, Earth’s essence in Zi, Mao, Chen, and Hai’s tide.
○ Star of Destiny: Heavenly Seal, upon Body and Destiny bestride.
For women—keen of heart; for men—renown’s pride.
If malevolent stars stay far, early authority is tied.
Should Anomaly draw near, untimely death or illness’s fear,
A life with little fortune, half in woe’s frontier.
If Heavenly Staff appears, borrowed power in official spheres,
Concubines may bear sons, but the wife remains barren for years.

**Song:**
Heavenly Seal—originally a star benign,
Mao’s head alone makes it malign.
Delighting in Zi and Mao’s two palaces’ sway,
Wielding military power, a general’s array.

**Song:**
Heavenly Seal—originally a star benign,
In Zi, Mao, Chen, and Si—glory’s design.
High office, weighty authority—all admire,
Resounding fame shakes the imperial spire.

**Song:**
Heavenly Seal upon the body—power’s might,
Threefold support strengthens its light.
Nobility and prominence in the imperial court reside,
With Heavenly Blade as aide, a minister’s rank applied.

If neither Void Weeping nor Mao’s Anomaly draws near,
Wealth and nobility unite, a century to revere.
When Seal Star enters its temple, most wondrous indeed,
Misfortune dissolves, and fortune follows with speed.
Crucial is the meeting of auspicious stars in one’s fate,
Youth ascends the celestial ladder, swift and great.

**Heavenly Longevity**
Symbol: Yang, Earth, in Hai, You, and Xu
Longevity Star stands alone—sons ensure no solitude.
Official misfortune never arises in life’s span,
Calamities vanish, leaving none to withstand.
If not ensnared in ruin’s snare,
Fortune abounds, and wealth beyond compare.
Should no malevolent stars dwell in its native palace,
Lifespan rivals Peng Zu’s, boundless and flawless.

**Song:**
In Si, Hai, and Wu palaces, Heavenly Treasury’s store,
Jade and gold accumulate, beyond all count or lore.
Should Mao’s Weeping draw too near, base illness may arise,
Yet youth recalls events of centuries with clear, unclouded eyes.

**Song:**
Heavenly Treasury graces the Lion’s palace bright,
Or in Si and Hai—its glory shines with equal light.
If the three directions bear no baleful stars in sight,
Jade and gold amass, a wealthy lord’s delight.

Wisdom and cunning craft each plan it laid.
Gold and silver need not toil to secure,
Fame or fortune—either path is sure.

**Literary Brilliance**
Symbol: Yang, Wood, in Yin, Wu, and Xu
○ Star named Literary Prosperity, upon fate and body cast,
Men’s words like scattered pearls, women’s embroidery unsurpassed.
Though youth may shun the scholar’s path, renown still finds its way,
Official rank and salary through literary prowess sway.
In Yin, Wu, and Xu palaces, most wondrous its display,
Literary Star and noble hosts fill heaven’s vault each day,
Youth excels in imperial exams, crowns the host of peers.
Yet Heavenly Staff’s approach brings poverty and years,
A century’s name in vain, a hollow, fleeting sphere.

**Song:**
Literary Brilliance in Xu, with Yin and Wu aligned,
There, glory dons gold and purple, noble and refined.
From the imperial academy, fame resounds afar,
With writings peerless, a scholar’s name shines like a star.

**Song:**
Literary Brilliance in temple, flourishing and bright,
Assuredly brings wisdom and world-renowned light.
Even in decline, high favor may yet be found,
In public and private spheres, a name of renown abounds.

**Song:**
When Literary Brilliance and auspicious stars unite,
One scales the loftiest ranks, surpassing all in sight.
Red Phoenix’s talent—exquisite, rare,
Beauty and fortune harmonize beyond compare.
If Fortune and Virtue upon fate and body rest,
Surely both blessings follow, doubly blessed.

**Song:**
Red Phoenix in temple graces fate and form,
A visage fair as Guanyin, serene and warm.
In temperament and nature, gentle, mild, and kind,
Surpassing all, the crowd’s esteem they bind.

**Coiled Rope**
Symbol: Yin, Earth, in Mao, Si, Wu, Wei, and Hai
○ Star named Coiled Rope, upon fate and body cast,
Life marked by frequent rises, frequent falls—half joy, half woe at last.
With Mao’s Head drawing near, like Yanzi’s early end,
Yet Staff Star’s light may lengthen life, to Peng Zu’s years extend.
In Si and Hai palaces, its temple’s power grows,
Late years bring wealth and salary, prosperity bestows.

**Song:**
Coiled Star in Si and Hai stands strong and high,
Household thrives, fields and estates multiply.
Heavenly Staff’s near light brings sons in store,
Yet Mao’s Weeping leaves but one to deplore.

**Song:**
Coiled Rope’s star, by name Profound Mystery,
In Wei, Shen, Si, and Hai, its threads entwine.
Gold and jade fill halls, piled high as earth,
Wealth and salary overflow, ten thousand fields of worth.

**Song:**
Coiled Rope’s star, by name Profound Subtlety,
In fate, its presence marks a root most free.
If Heaven’s Anomaly and Mao’s Head keep their distance,
Peace and advantage reign, life’s course resilient.

**Heavenly Treasury**
Symbol: Yang, Earth, in Mao, Si, Hai, and Wu
○ Star named Heavenly Treasury—wealth and nobility attend,
Women amass fields and estates, men rise to ranks ascend.
In Si, Hai, and Wu, fortunes multiply,
Facing peril unshaken, danger defied.
This star’s native bears three sons, one remains,
As Blade and Executioner their paths constrain.

**Song:**
Heavenly Longevity graces life with lengthened span,
Hai and You palaces its finest plan.
If Blade or Weeping should their light impart,
Future holds a marquis’s rank, a kingly heart.

Delights in You and Hai, where life extends its line.
Should auspicious stars their radiance bestow,
Lifespan strengthens, fortune and salary grow.

In fate and body dwelling, noble beyond par.
Revered for virtue and fortune, all gaze with awe,
In fame and salary, wealth and honor draw.

**Song:**
Auspicious Longevity holds fortune’s sway,
In temple’s glory, blessings naturally stay.
Abroad, a general; at court, a minister’s role,
All proclaim the worthy, a sage of olden scroll.

**Red Phoenix**
Symbol: Yin, Metal, in Chen, Chou, and Yin
Star named Red Phoenix—tall of stature, form,
Men wed early, women face no harm.
In Chen and Chou, wisdom, wealth, and grace,
Without baleful stars to mar the way,
A radiant life spans eighty years’ embrace.
Red Phoenix’s auspicious light brings beauty’s face.

**Song:**
Red Phoenix’s joy—what bliss it brings,
Yet Mao’s Head’s baleful star must not take wings.
Should Executioner or Blade their light combine,
Like frost-struck lotus, half the pond’s design.

**Song:**
Red Phoenix’s star has ever been benign,
In Si, Hai, Yin, and Chou, its path divine.
Half a lifetime’s fortune, contentment’s reign,
Nobility and imperial favor, lordly domain.

Gold at the waist, purple robes sway,
Assisting the enlightened sovereign’s way.

Women fair of face, dignified in mien,
Men wed early, sons arrive in time.
Without malevolent stars to cloud the scene,
Wealth and treasures multiply, serene.
In Shen and Mao, its power grows,
Free from calamity, free from woes,
Parents and siblings whole, complete,
Husband and wife to a century’s beat.

**Song:**
Heavenly Fortune in Shen and Mao, a scholar’s grace,
Gold at the waist, fine writings trace.
Should Weeping or Void their light impart,
Poverty or early death—both wound the heart.

A magnanimous spirit, resolute and great.
With Salary Star’s threefold light aligned,
Destined for glory, wealth, and rank refined.

Best upon body and fate to shed its light.
Fortune and salary flourish, noble sons arise,
Three directions unbroken, salary multiplies.

**Heavenly Salary**
Symbol: Yang, Wood, in Si and Shen
○ Salary Star’s approach—malevolent stars kept at bay,
Wisdom and intelligence mark the way,
All endeavors prosper, each wish fulfilled.
In Si and Shen, fate and body stand fulfilled.
Auspicious stars bring three sons, two remain,
As Mao’s Head lingers, its light sustains.

Should they not share the same path,
Merits and deeds shall flourish, fields be acquired.

**Song:**
When Supreme Ultimate and Heavenly Salary hold their rightful place,
All auspicious stars they meet find their proper station.
If Mao’s Head star does not share the same palace,
Career and renown shall be achieved by one’s own creation.

**Song:**
The Salary Origin star governs scholarly rank,
Adorned in brocade and girded with gold, most noble and grand.
Assisting the sovereign to accomplish great deeds,
One becomes a royal scion, golden branch and jade leaf in the land.

**Song:**
Dwelling in Shen and Si, known as the Three Terraces,
Fortune sweeps away all misfortune, prosperity comes of its own accord.
Wealth and grain accumulate abundantly throughout life,
With literary talent, one shall ascend as the foremost laureate.

**Song:**

Wielding authority, one’s path is widely proclaimed.
With fortune and Wenchang’s grace in full array,
Heroes and valiant men live in ease and acclaim.

**Heavenly Staff**
Symbol: Yang, Wood, in Wei, Hai, Zi, and Shen
Star named Heavenly Staff—concubines bear sons,
Yet men’s marriages yield no heirs, or hardship, poverty, or early death ensue.
When the staff falls in its temple, glory and nobility come without strife.
When it leaps into the palace, purity and kindness bring fortune’s light.

**Song:**

If not clad in fur or bearing horns, one becomes but a servant before donkeys and behind horses.
Yet should the Official Star dwell in Hai or Zi, though rich and noble, one remains solitary in life.

**Song:**
The Heavenly Staff fares best when roaming Hai or Zi,
Or sought in Shen and You as well.
All matters align with heart’s desire, seldom thwarted,
And with added longevity, woes and grief dispel.

**Song:**
In form most comely, in bearing most refined,
In human affairs, none more complete.
When the Heavenly Staff star enters one’s fate,
Auspicious stars lend aid, and benevolent stars align.
Should this luminary appear in the natal chart,
As official or clerk, one moves with ease and grace.

**Song:**
When the staff resides in the lunar position, misfortune reigns—
How then may one ascend the Celestial Gate? Yet if none,
When the Heavenly Staff enters its temple, called the Heavenly Might,
It grasps military power and pacifies the four barbarians.
This is the Authority Star, fierce turned auspicious,
Its heroic renown shining bright without bound.

**Heavenly Anomaly**
Symbol: Yin, Earth, in Chen, Chou, and Wei
Star named Heavenly Anomaly—when the Void Star shares its palace,
Two evils conspire, yet youth does not meet an early end.
Though minor blessings may arise, misfortune prevails,
Parents are afflicted, siblings nonexistent, children few.
Ancestral estates vanish, all destroyed,
A life adrift, wandering east and west.
Yet in Wei, Chou, or Chen’s palace,
Joy abounds when auspicious stars converge, and emoluments multiply.

**Song:**
When life and fate are bound to Anomaly and Void,
Even at lakeside crossings, no sorrow clouds the way.
But if inauspicious stars strike with punitive force,
One drifts like smoke in wind, or embers in the breeze.

**Song:**
The Heavenly Anomaly star bodes ill,
Yet joy comes in Chou, Wei, and Chen’s domain.
In Chen and Si, no harm, but boundless delight,
All undertakings flourish and thrive.

**Song:**
The Leaping of Parting weighs most on the heart,
Heaven’s decree leaves brows knit in vain distress.
A widow with three husbands still finds no content,
A lone man with five wives yet weds not in full.

**Song:**
When the Anomaly star enters its temple, directly in palace,
Wealth and grain accumulate in great abundance.
Within fields and estates, vigor and prosperity reign,
And with life and fate blessed by auspicious stars, all is grand.

**Hairy Head**
Symbol: Yin, Water, in Zi, Mao, Wei, Yin, and Xu
Star named Hairy Head—only joyous when flourishing.
If solitary in course, women harm husbands and children,
While men face repeated marriages, ancestral homes emptied,
Forced to forge their own livelihoods.
Though clothing and food never lack,
Half a lifetime of toil still leads to dissipation and deceit,
For they are not the sort to preserve what’s been built.

**Song:**
In Hairy Head’s domain of Zi, Mao, Yin, and Xu,
Temperaments are serene, dispositions at ease, minds keen.
Men, if not wealthy, must be noble,
Women, if not noble, are sharp of heart.

**Song:**
Hairy Head’s weeping blade cannot be withstood,
Exile and flight mark the path to fame and profit.
Though ancestral estates may be worn away,
What of descendants? Can they endure long?

**Song:**
In Hairy Head’s realm of Zi, Mao, Yin, and Xu,
Fortune and kindness may be slight, yet blessings remain.
When auspicious stars descend to break the lineage’s branch,
One may rise to Heaven’s mandate, guarding the frontier.

**Song:**
Hairy Head, an ill star turned auspicious,
Those afflicted by it face lifelong poverty.
Yet if good stars come to their aid,
Even official troubles may multiply.

**Song:**
When Hairy Head enters its temple, nearing life and fate,
The one it meets should bear the mark of a warrior.
Renown resounds throughout the land,
As they guard the frontier, the four barbarians submit.

**Heavenly Blade**
Symbol: Yin, Metal, in Shen, Si, Wu, Yin, and You
When a single blade pierces the palace, wealth and emolument align,
Yet women harm husbands and children,
While men find no fulfillment in marriage,
Standing alone, though spared from calamity.
Parents and siblings do not remain,
Wives and servants cannot endure long.

**Song:**
When the Heavenly Blade’s blade arrives in layers,
Twofold encounter brings disaster.
With killing stars fourfold, like water and fire,
Youth meeting ill fate turns to ash.

**Song:**
Bloodshed invades fate, wounds and ruin follow,
Punitive blades bring calamity’s embrace.
A six-foot frame may perish to a tiger’s bite,
Or drown in waves, as fate decrees.

**Song:**
When the Blade star and punishment converge, parents suffer,
Men must seek adoption to fare well.
If a woman shares its palace’s light,
Her fate is sealed to wed anew.

**Song:**
Without fortune, the body is maimed, the visage marred,
With salvation, six relations still suffer.
The Heavenly Blade, a star of blood and rebellion, bodes ill,
When its limit arrives, calamity and hardship redouble.
Yet in its temple’s glory, civil and martial nobility may arise,
Beware, though, of underestimating foes, lest all come to naught.

**Song:**
Jade meets the Eight Killings, radiant and bright,
Yet in the Wealth Palace, fortune is incomplete.
If the Punishment Star does not enter its temple,
Snake-belly misfortune strikes that very year.

**Song:**
When the Heavenly Blade dwells in Si, Wu, or Shen,
And meets Yin’s position, glory shines.
Through martial valor, great deeds are achieved,
Fame resounds, authority commands ten thousand troops.

**Song:**
The Heavenly Blade, a baleful star, reaches the White Ram,
Its light illumines the cosmos, fixing the four directions.
Wielding power with masterful hands,
Gaining wealth and prominence, it must be auspicious.

**Heavenly Punishment**
Symbol: Yin, Fire, in Yin, Wu, You, and Xu
When the Punishment Star travels alone, it brings threefold incompletion:
As monk or Daoist, one fails to establish a home,
Yet finds no clarity—solitary, solitary!
If not solitary, then no brothers,
Parents not both whole,
Wives and servants do not endure.
In three palaces, the body is harmed, leading to madness or self-strangulation.

**Song:**

When the Thunderbolt Star strikes one’s fate, how can one not fear?
Meeting Punishment, the body falls—why descend further?
Life is cut short by baleful stars’ approach,
And the man dies beneath the thunder’s wrath.

**Song:**
The Threefold Incompletion Star is Heavenly Punishment,
As monk or Daoist, one is called a solitary soul.
When Blade and Wailing Stars converge above,
Swiftly one becomes a man beset by illness.

**Song:**
The Heavenly Maiden wanders in Xu, Mao, and Chen,
And seeks the Double Fish as well.
Though blessed with fortune, one indulges in wine and desire,
Yet passes through spring and autumn without disaster or calamity.

**Song:**
The Heavenly Maiden is the Xianchi.
Xianchi, a single baleful star, seeks truth alongside,
Meeting water’s allure brings ruin and lewdness.
Bathing in divine favor, one sees only nobility,
Yet the heart teaches the ruin of nations and cities.

**Song:**
The Maiden Star, like the Defeat Star,
Is called the "Sweeping Doom" among mortal stars.
A lifetime of toil and hardship,
Never knowing ease within the home.

**Song:**
When the Heavenly Maiden enters the temple, it brings fortune,
And when fate aligns, prosperity is assured.
Meeting a virtuous wife, blessings and emolument increase,
And like ice growing firm upon the earth, one rises high and strong.

**The Eighteen Stars and Their Affiliations**
Wailing, Blade, Bow, Metal, Fire—these are Punishment,
Purple, Pattern, Staff, Emolument—Wood forms a forest.
Fur, Maiden, Void—Water; Noble, Fortune—Earth,
Seal, Longevity, Treasury, Guanyin—Earth shares their bond.

When any star enters the Body or Fate Palaces,
Examine its Five Phases affiliation,
And discern its timely illumination of the Three Directions and Four Cardinals.
Note which stars reside in harmonious palaces,
And judge their mutual generation, conquest, restraint, and transformation,
To determine fortune, emolument, good, and ill.

**Essential Four-Character Verse Summary from the *Ru Gu Xian Jing***

One must not cling to a single principle—judgment depends on the individual’s circumstances.
Both fate and annual cycles must be considered together.

**On Determining Fate and Cycles**
Begin from the opposing palace of the minor limit, placing one star in each palace.
Yang men and yin women proceed in sequence; yin men and yang women proceed in reverse.
Start from the palace of one’s birth and life.

Use the Purple Forbidden, Luan, Literary, Noble, Void, Seal, Longevity, Fortune, Emolument, Storehouse, and Link stars to arrange the remaining external stars, along with the Greater and Lesser Weeping Stars.
Reverse the annual Tai Sui to the previous palace, proceeding counterclockwise before the Purple Forbidden and Void.
Observe the Staff, Divergent, Tiger, Fur, Serpent, Blade, and Boar stars—all proceed counterclockwise from Wu.
When encountering Punishment at You, Maiden at Chou, or the same in reverse, proceed in harmony with the Tai Sui’s conjunction.
The Lesser Weeping Star’s position is one palace before Shen as the auxiliary; one palace behind the body holds three days.
For life and fate, there are two palaces of decline and three of destiny.
The two declines are at Wei; when encountering the first Rooster, second Serpent, third Horse, fourth Goat, fifth Tiger, sixth Rabbit, seventh Dragon, eighth Pig, ninth Dog, tenth Goat, eleventh Monkey, or twelfth Rat, fortune and misfortune must be carefully examined.

If one’s three-day period includes an auspicious star, it signifies encounters with noble patrons, advancement, and wealth—most favorable in the Migration Palace.

*End of the First Scroll of the Purple Forbidden Astrology*

**Tai Yi Golden Well: On the Profound Principles of Yin and Yang**
*Beginning of the Second Scroll of the Purple Forbidden Astrology*

A person is endowed with the qi of Heaven and Earth, receiving the essence of yin and yang to give rise to their body and fate. Above, they belong to the Five Stars; below, to the Five Phases. If the timing is correct, their body and fate will be exalted, and their future bright and prosperous. If the timing is incorrect, their fate will be base and their body lowly, sinking into obscurity and drift.

Generally, one’s life must find the stars in their proper positions, with favorable fortune and strength aligning to bring success. Moreover, if one delights in prosperity without affliction, and auspicious stars reside in strong palaces, they are a person of profound fortune. This is predestined, governed by the stars.

In examining fate, first determine the Body Palace, for the body is linked above to the spirit of Tai Yi. If beneficent stars meet with prosperous fortune in their proper positions, forming celestial harmony, this is a life of purity and nobility. Only then should one assess the Fate Palace and the hour, for if these are shallow or unstable, they lack strength. Even with powerful stars, their blessings will be slight. Only when timing is correct and positions proper can one attain glory, virtue, fields and dwellings, official rank, and emolument.

The six palaces’ good and ill determine survival and demise; nobility and baseness fix fortune and misfortune, yielding accurate predictions. Whenever stars reside in palaces of honor or places of joy and prosperity, one must also consider the yin and yang divisions of the palaces. As the classic states: “Yang stars favor goodness; yin stars favor destruction.”

In the two palaces of stars and fate, when the division of hours and quarters yields more yang than yin—such as being born in the first, second, third, or fourth quarter of the hour—one’s fortune will be abundant, life long, parents blessed, siblings harmonious, wife virtuous, and children outstanding. If one’s body and fate further reside in palaces of honor and prosperity, this is a life of the highest rank.

Men born under yang stars are noble births. Those born in the first four quarters will be resolute and blessed. Women born under yin stars are honorable births. Those born from the fifth to the eighth quarter will excel in wifely virtue, enjoy support from maternal kin, harmony with sisters-in-law, a marriage of mutual respect, and children who are both talented and numerous.

One must calculate the hour precisely to gauge fortune and misfortune, determine the harmony of flesh and bone, discern the presence of affliction or conflict, and distinguish between wealth and poverty, wisdom and folly.

Yang stars govern civil matters and thrive in their palaces of honor and prosperity. Occupying the six yang palaces, they produce scholars of refined literary grace. Yin stars govern martial matters and flourish in places of joy and prosperity. Occupying the six yin domains, they produce warriors of courage and resolve.

Whenever stars reside in yang within yang or in yin within yin, each following its kind, this is called “finding its proper position.” The opposite—yin and yang intermingled—is called “not finding its proper position.” The qi one receives may be turbid: within a single day, from *mao* to *shen* (5 a.m. to 5 p.m.) are the six yang hours of daylight; from *you* to *yin* (5 p.m. to 5 a.m.) are the six yin hours of night.

Those born in yin palaces should avoid daytime births; those born in yang palaces should avoid nighttime births. Both positions are unfavorable at the same hour. Further, births occurring at the cusp of day and night, or when the hour straddles upper and lower quarters, require careful assessment of fortune and lifespan. If yin and yang are mixed, the quarters uneven, and the pairing inauspicious, this—beyond mere honor or prosperity—portends a life of meager fortune and short span.

Moreover, one must observe the transiting limits where beneficent or malefic stars enter the moments of body and fate, for this precisely determines fortune and misfortune, all of which will be verified.

**The Three Divisions of Flesh and Bone: A Rhymed Exposition**
Of old, the profound principle was called the Purple Forbidden, uniquely holding the wonders of a single school. It became the marvel of the Three Divisions, exploring the roots of stars’ good and ill, thoroughly seeking the inner mysteries, and fixing the noble and base positions of the palaces. By careful examination, survival and demise are discerned.

When the Supreme Ultimate first divided, the Three Powers were complete. Yet why do some grow poor and die young? Why do others grow rich and live long? The reasons lie in fate’s rise and fall, in the purity or impurity of one’s nature, and in the alternation of calamity and fortune.

Tracing back to ancient texts, blessings and emoluments shine together in the Purple Forbidden’s position. All stars’ conditions, hours, and quarters are detailed below.

In the upper configuration, a noble fate—three days after the life and destiny palaces, the four auxiliary palaces are all auspicious.
The Old Man Star in conjunction portends parents of advanced age, attaining ministerial rank.
If the life and destiny palaces encounter the *Yifeng*, it is auspicious.
The **Difu** and Old Man in conjunction portend the mother’s longevity and elevation to ministerial or grandee status.
When the **Luanwei**, Seal, Longevity, and other stars align with the day’s hour and moment, and further encounter beneficent stars in their celestial seats—three parts beneficence to one part exalted brilliance—this is the fate of the highest nobility.
The twelve hours divide into one hundred moments; only after meticulous study of stellar configurations and degrees can one discern fortune and misfortune, for therein lies verification.

○ When yin ascends and yang descends, malefic stars opposing the Staff harm the father;
when beneficent stars harmonize, all enjoy longevity.

**Mid-Chart Noble Destiny:**
When auspicious stars stand high and inauspicious stars lie low, with the life and destiny palaces graced by propitious constellations—**Wenchang** in attendance, auxiliary and seal stars arrayed in the four directions or forming a triple conjunction with fortune-bringing stars, stationed in their proper or exalted palaces—then the auxiliary and seal stars govern eight *ke* of the proper hour, while the nine luminaries occupy positions of strength. If the fortune star resides in its exalted palace, harmoniously aspecting the opposite palace, and the auxiliary star alone stands high over the life and destiny palaces, even a single star in its proper or exalted position shines brightly in a position of strength. Alternatively, if within the three-day palace and the eight *ke*, one occupies the domain of the six yin palaces, with the **Luan** star unaspected by the **Celestial Staff**, the mother enjoys long life, and if further exalted, this denotes a mid-chart noble destiny, a life of wealth and prominence.

**Lower-Chart Noble Destiny:**
When the **Taifu** star alone stands high over the life and destiny palaces, and the three-day palace is fully aspected by three auspicious stars in triple conjunction, this constitutes a lower-chart noble destiny. If the fortune star is exalted and strong while auspicious stars are weak and debilitated, it signifies a lesser noble destiny. Such is the interplay of yin and yang, the harmony of time and moment.

**Common Destiny Outside the Chart:**
When auspicious and inauspicious stars jointly aspect the life palace, and the **Taifu** star is not in its proper position, this denotes the destiny of a wealthy commoner. If the **Taifu** star is weak and debilitated, yet **Hongluan** aspects directly without affliction, and the **Red Luan** forms a harmonious aspect, this signifies a person of immense wealth.

**Destitute and Lowly Destiny:**
When the fortune star is debilitated in **Tianyao**, aspecting both the life and destiny palaces, with the **Xu** star in opposition, this marks the most destitute and lowly destiny—parents lost in early years, siblings few or nonexistent, wives and children harmed. Even if one encounters a favorable period with auspicious stars, wealth does not accumulate, for the root is shallow and weak. Though one may possess literary talent and official emolument, this does not constitute a destiny within the chart.

**Foolish Destiny:**
The **Wenchang** star must not be debilitated, for the six auspicious stars, when in positions of strength, become inauspicious. If they do not reside in their proper palaces, how much more dire the misfortune? Generally, when stars enter the chart, one need not consider official emolument. For scholars, one must examine **Wenchang**; for commoners, one may simply observe **Tianlu** and **Tianzhang** to determine the measure of longevity and prosperity.

**Determining the Aspects of Palace Conjunctions:**
When fortune and longevity jointly aspect **Hongluan**, how can one not be intelligent? When **Xu** and **Yi** together attend **Maotou**, how can one not be dull-witted? If positioned in **Tianyin**, it governs migration and authority; if in **Wenchang**, it lacks the conduct of fortune and emolument. In the **Fields and Estates** palace, granaries overflow with grain; in the **Wealth and Silk** palace, coffers brim with gold and jade. When **Noble Emolument** aspects the **Children** palace, descendants bring glory; when **Storehouse** and **Guan** aspect the **Life and Destiny** palace, one’s future is ever secure, and honor flourishes. If **Yao** and **Yi** entangle the body, longevity is denied; if **Blade** and **Wailing** afflict destiny, **Tianxu** and **Tianren** bring only calamity. **Tianxing** and **Tianzhang**—who could find joy in their presence? When they meet wives and concubines, widowhood is often auspicious; when they enter the **Official Emolument** palace, poverty and illness abound. To encounter these stars in one’s fate is to face imminent peril; to pass beyond their influence is to escape disaster. Thus, destiny knows prosperity and adversity, but not permanence. The successful occupy positions of strength, while the struggling dwell in desolation. Honor, prosperity, and longevity arise from the conjunction of auspicious stars; violence, misfortune, and early death stem from the convergence of inauspicious ones. Without the stars, how could one examine the details? Without fate, how could one know the essentials? With keen focus and deep reflection, one may unlock the mysteries of this text. By discussing the present and exploring the past, one comes to recognize the excellence of this work.

**Life and Death, Poverty and Wealth:**
If not predestined, how could one know? **Nobility and lowliness, prosperity and decay**—these are not matters of chance. The art of divination is both precise and subtle. By studying the classics, one may revisit them thrice and come to understand. To grasp this profound art requires more than a single day. The teachings of the **Four Lords and Three Origins** are as unchanging as true gold; the discourse on the **Five Stars and Six Luminaries** is as invaluable as fine jade. By silently observing the principles of the **Eighteen Stars** and mastering the essentials of the **Twelve Palaces**, one may discern poverty and wealth, nobility and lowliness—none can escape the scrutiny of the fortune stars.

**Man receives the qi of Heaven and Earth, forming the Three Powers.**
Those complete in Heaven, Earth, and Man are called *cheng ren* (perfected persons), and when their fate aligns with prosperity, their wealth endures without limit. Those incomplete in Heaven, Earth, and Man are called *bu cheng ren* (imperfect persons), and when their fate arrives, their wealth collapses without recourse. Generally, those unaspected by **Xu**, **Wailing**, **Punishment**, or **Blade** are complete; those afflicted by them are incomplete. When fate enters a yang palace and encounters a yang star, or enters a yin palace and encounters a yin star, each receives the harmony of Heaven’s timing. To meet the **Wailing** star in a year of avoidance is to see immediate consequences.

**At birth, if the Zi and Hong noble stars reside in the life and destiny palaces,**
the early years bring honor and nobility, with emolument flourishing and expanding. If **Wenchang** and other stars aspect directly or reside in their proper or exalted palaces, auspicious events and joy follow. When **Tianxu** enters one’s fate, wealth and silk dissipate; wherever it aspects, misfortune and strangeness arise. When **Tianyin** enters one’s fate and occupies a position of strength in its proper palace, it brings the joy of wealth and authority. Even if not within the chart, it heralds auspicious events. To encounter **Hongluan** in one’s fate is to wed a woman of beauty or for a woman to marry a man of talent. When the **Xu** star aspects one’s fate, it brings false alarms. **Yao** and **Blade** govern water disasters; **Mao** and **Yi** govern fire calamities, exile, or forced name changes. If one’s fate encounters **Storehouse** and **Guan**, it brings sudden wealth, lifting the poor to riches. For the rest, inauspicious stars follow the guidance of the **Wenchang** star—examining the stars’ positions in their palaces provides the standard, without the slightest error.

Should there be those who die at the very onset of a fate-period, or perish as it draws near, one must rely on the stars of life and death for precise judgment. If the **Tianku** star shines directly upon one’s fate and destiny, it is called the **Yellow Springs star**. If it shines directly upon the fate-period while also opposing it, this is termed the **Raging Waves fate-period**, presaging death and layer upon layer of mourning. In yang palaces, it brings much sorrow; in yin palaces, it may bring some joy. Even if it resides in its proper temple as a fortune star, one cannot escape external bereavement or the wearing of mourning for kin.

The **Raging Waves fate-period**, in another account, is said to be the **Staff, Cangue, and Wailing**—these three stars. The judgment states:

*Gain and loss, poverty and prosperity are not easily fathomed,*
*For all depend upon the palace of fate and destiny.*
*When auspicious stars descend here, blessings abound;*
*When baleful stars align, one meets a grim end.*

The verse says:
*When both **Yao** and **Yi** stars shine upon one’s fate,*
*This baleful pair portends inevitable misfortune.*
*Breaking from one’s roots and leaving home, given to wine and lust,*
*The man becomes a lecher, the woman a harlot.*

The verse says:
*The **Tianku** star is most inauspicious;*
*If it appears at the great fate-period, danger and death follow.*
*Say not that ancestral estates will be worn away—*
*Fear rather that one’s span of years will not be long.*

The verse says:
*When the **Xu** and **Blade** stars aspect one’s fate,*
*Only in forests and wilds may one find peace.*
*For the common man who offends them, a thousand leagues of travel*
*Will bring disaster upon disaster, one after another.*

The verse says:
*When baleful stars afflict one amid illness,*
*The five viscera fall into disorder, beyond boasting.*
*Crooked back, hunched waist, and bent spine—*
*Even if one’s years are long, fortune will not be kind.*

The verse says:
*Of the four cardinal palaces, strength is most vital;*
*When beneficent stars shine upon them, joy is extraordinary.*
*But if the **Wailing** and **Blade** stars stand overhead,*
*Bone and flesh suffer harm, and mourning knows no end.*
*In fields and dwellings, ancestral estates are broken;*
*For wives and concubines, injury is certain.*
*In office and emolument, matters arise without cause;*
*In the palace of fate, discord and strangeness prevail.*
*From beginning to end, fortune and misfortune are foreordained—*
*Trace them step by step, and scrutinize with care.*

The verse says:
*The **Tianku** star is most inauspicious;*
*Should it appear, calamity is sure to follow.*
*Though ancestral estates may be worn away to nothing,*
*Swiftly, swiftly, one’s years will not be long.*

The verse says:
*Baleful stars bring wailing, the greatest of disasters;*
*Troubles upon troubles enter the household.*
*If the yearly fate-period encounters this baleful star,*
*The family will witness wailing and times of decline.*

The verse says:
*When **Punishment** and **Wailing** meet, matters are not light;*
*If the year’s fate encounters them, false alarms arise.*
*When fortune and emolument are at their peak, guard against childbirth calamity;*
*People scatter, wealth disperses, and peace is lost.*

The verse says:
*The **Tianren** star is the **Sevenfold Harm**;*
*When it clashes with the yearly fate-period, injury and death are certain.*
*Unless one relies on the power of hidden virtue,*
*Disaster and heavy mourning will surely befall.*

**Judgment of the Eighteen Subtle Stars**

The **Ziwei** star, also called **Purple Qi**, **Great Yang**, **Jade Hall**, or **Lesser Yang**, is close to the noble and honored. The *Jin Treatise* states: This star dwells at the center of the imperial enclosure, most exalted and noble. Auspicious stars can restrain it. When it shines with wisdom and kindness, it presides over long life and wealth. In judging its configuration:

Standing alone above the gate of heaven is called **Bowing to the North Star**, presaging nobility. Residing alone in the *mao* position is called the **Emerging from Chen Configuration**, presaging great nobility. When it shines upon the body and meets with auspicious stars in attendance, this is called the **Pure Radiance Configuration**. When it is at ease in its temple, joyful in its prosperity, or in the *ji-you* temple, this is the **Temple Configuration**; in the *shen-hai* palace, joyful in *zi* prosperity, this is the **Intersecting Palace Configuration**. When one’s fate or destiny encounters it, it bestows a love of the Dao, much talent and knowledge, purple robes and golden belts, honor and esteem, with petty men kept at a distance. If one cultivates kindness and studies the Dao, one may attain the destiny of an immortal.

When it shines upon the palace of the body, it grants emolument, a pure and upright office, literary talent, and great wisdom. Dwelling in this palace, it bestows a life of kindness and good fortune. If it does not reside in its temple or prosperity, it becomes a solitary spirit, favoring monks and Daoists who observe fasts and precepts. If it aligns with the **Blade** star, it makes one a recluse among mountains, springs, and rocks. If it meets with dark stars, it inclines one toward lust, a harsh nature, and estrangement from kin. For women, it harms the husband and children. But if it meets with auspicious spirits, it brings honor to the husband and prosperity to the children, with titles and nobility. If it loses its position, it declines and weakens, though even in peril there is deliverance, making one a person of the nine schools.

In all palace divisions, when it appears in the palace of office and emolument, it bestows high rank, a love of goodness, the planting of virtue, and unwavering adherence to propriety and righteousness. When encountered in the fate-period, it presages an audience with the ruler. This star governing one’s fate bestows an ancient countenance, a plump and full figure, a lean and tall frame, a hunched back, a dull and murky complexion with purple or crimson hues, or a yellowish-white tone. In children, it manifests as a clear, lean, and sallow appearance.

The verse says:

At *zi*:
Courteous in manner, one becomes a guest of honor,
Revering the worthy and despising the unkind.
Master of civil arts and martial strategy,
Pure and noble, one serves as a court minister.

The verse says:

At *chou*:
In the *chou* position, humble yet solitary,
Kin and marriage bonds seem as if nonexistent.
With virtue and righteousness put into practice,
The grand thoroughfare lies smooth and open.

The verse says:

At *yin*:
In the *yin* position, styled the True Person,
Yet along the way, no close companions.
Once aspirations lay beyond the minister’s rank,
Yet the body too has served the lord.

The verse says:

At *mao*:
In the *mao* position, styled the Pivot of Harmony,
All due to alternating cycles of solitude.
First hardship, then ease,
In later years, the path is abundant.

The verse says:

At *chen*:
At *chen*, the Celestial Void,
Fame is achieved, and times are prosperous.
Marriage and kinship are not my portion,
With doubled fists, one strives alone.

The verse says:

At *si*:
At *si*, grace is received from the world,
Fame is made in the great capital.
Basking in the radiance of the sun’s pure light,
How could extraordinary merit not arise?

The verse says:

At *wu*:
Heaven’s grace enters solitude and emptiness,
Where perilous winds are met.
Though the source remains, it does not dry too soon,
With effort, one ascends the celestial thoroughfare.

The verse says:

At *wei*:
Purple enters the Celestial Abyss,
By nature good, discerning foolish from wise.
Lofty aspirations bring midway hardship,
Yet in later years, the path shines brightly.

The verse says:

At *shen*:
By nature especially gentle and kind,
With a noble heart and far-reaching ambitions.
Master of civil arts and martial strategy,
One holds authority, guarding the frontier.

The verse says:

At *you*:
Above *you* shines the Purple Tenuity Star,
Dignity and bearing draw near the Most Honored.
One’s name stands above the master’s,
Reputation and worth mirror heaven and earth.

The verse says:

At *xu*:
Heaven’s joy arrives at the White Ram,
The osmanthus of the moon sprays autumn’s fragrance.
Success and failure are often experienced,
Yet in later years, the scene is surely fine.

The verse says:

At *hai*:
*Purple* reaches the Gate of Heaven,
A solitary self floats like a cloud.
Worry not for one’s own affairs,
For one of keen insight must draw near the sovereign.

The Star of Celestial Emptiness, also called the Star of No Substance.
Where it shines, *kongwang* brings mourning garb, the Black Spring Road, and the Celestial End within the celestial wall—a star of ruin and loss.
Where it illuminates, good fortune turns ill, and misfortune brings poverty. It governs recklessness and mourning garb.
When it resides in its temple and flourishes in the *chou* position of the body and fate palace, it bestows cleverness but meager fortune.
Where the star of falsehood and deception shines, it brings anxiety and the dissipation of wealth and silk.
When conjoined with malevolent stars, it also shortens life.
If in its temple and flourishing with auspicious stars, as if gaining ground, one attains the rank of *yuanwailang*; if losing ground, one becomes reckless, and life is cut short.
When meeting auspicious stars in the same palace, it still brings empty fame and hollow profit.
When conjoined with stars of staff and blade, it governs death by law.
With punishment, it brings violent death; with blade, early demise; with staff, greed and cruelty; with *mao*, ruin and loss; with *yao*, licentiousness and elopement; with *ku*, solitude; with *yi*, a fondness for cunning schemes.
If in the palace of the body, it governs dual surnames in one lifetime and early loss of the father; for women, its appearance is inauspicious.
In the palace of official emolument, it brings empty fame.
In the palace of appearance, it averts disaster.
In the palace of servants, one’s wisdom is surpassed by that of a slave.
When encountered in the limits of fate, matters multiply.
When meeting punishment and killing stars, and the limit arrives, it becomes the Three Mounds and Five Graves—all good things in life turn to naught, and all affairs come to nothing in the end.
If the star of the body is afflicted by the blade of emptiness and punishment, the mother is lost early.

The verse says:
Awakening to the Three Thousand and the Great Thousand...

In life, never be ensnared by profit or fame.

**Zi (子):**
In the Zi position, named Celestial Emptiness,
Schemes and plans dissolve like dreams.
The household foundation must be self-built,
Livelihood drifts like tumbleweed.

*Verse:*
In the Chou (丑) position, within the Dipper-Ox Palace,
How could the solitary Dao ever be exhausted?
With clarity to discern black from white,
One’s body abides in the path of office.

*Verse:*
In the Yin (寅) position, if the Void Star resides,
Brilliance and Dao are not one’s own.
To glorify ancestors,
One cares for oneself, not others.

*Verse:*
In the Mao (卯) position, Celestial Exhaustion nears the spring,
Peaceful dwelling is not natural.
Tempered through winter’s end,
The spirit grows ever more steadfast.

*Verse:*
In the Chen (辰) position, granaries enter Celestial Emptiness,
Half a lifetime is clearly solitary.
Though emolument is never lacking,
One remains bound to the road of service.

*Verse:*
In the Si (巳) position, named Supreme Unity of Void and Waste,
Detours are not born of arrogance.
Half a life spent in haste,
Fortune arrives only in middle age.

*Verse:*
In the Wu (午) position, how could the Void Mansion flee?
Loyal words reach the sage’s mechanism.
Wind and waves strike mid-course,
Yet in later years, all is left to action.

*Verse:*
In the Wei (未) position, Jade Hall hosts Celestial Solitude,
How could restraints not exist?
Marriage and kinship are not one’s own,
Foundations and plans must be self-made.

*Verse:*
In the Shen (申) position, Celestial Emptiness is called the Solitary Mansion,
Seeking the Dao brings abundant robes and emolument.
If paired with the Strange,
One bears two surnames in a single life.

*Verse:*
In the You (酉) position, meeting the Void—do not fear toil,
Even vast wealth may wear away.
Only through self-reliance does one become accomplished,
And in later years, rise high.

*Verse:*
In the Xu (戌) position, if auspicious stars align,
Ancestral legacy must be renewed.
This life’s affairs of fame and profit,
Are pursued in two separate realms.

*Verse:*
In the Hai (亥) position, one becomes a solitary child,
Success and failure often wane.
Ancestral legacy exists as if it does not,
One must rely on self-devised measures.

The Celestial Noble Star, also called the Heavenly Unity of Primordial Peace.
The *Sui History* states: This star is the gate of the Purple Tenuity Palace, the spirit of Supreme Unity. It governs battle, discerns human fortune and misfortune, wields the power of authority and blessing, and restrains the stars of good and evil. It presides over nobility, literary brilliance, and erudition.

When in its temple or prosperous palace (Chen as temple, Yin as joy, Hai as prosperity), and in the Palace of Life and Destiny, it bestows extraordinary achievements, surpassing the crowd, easy resolution of difficulties, favor from the eminent, and distance from the base. It brings renown. In this palace, it grants superior wisdom, a mind full of literature, love for the Dao, honor, and official rank with distinction.

It is also said: In youth, through strange dreams, one gains advantage. When in its temple or prosperity, with authority and the three directions in harmony, a lifetime of glory ensues. Even in the presence of killing stars, they retreat. Though hardship may arise, one is always near the noble.

When meeting malevolent stars—Mao Head, Seal, Staff, or paired with Yao (lewdness), Ku (mourning), or Ru (blade)—or when evil aligns with punishment in the same palace, it breeds a thousand cunning schemes. If afflicted by inauspicious stars or the blade of punishment, parents meet an untimely end, and kinship lacks strength.

For women, if auspicious stars appear, they attain nobility, titles, golden crowns, and purple seals. If meeting malevolent stars, they are unkind and unjust, harming husbands and children, becoming base and vile.

In the Palace of Official Emolument, it makes one stand out, unafraid of trouble, without ill intent. When fate’s limits encounter it, there is joy and celebration.

When the Celestial Noble guards destiny, it bestows a dignified form, a fair and round face, a broad and generous demeanor, a tall and stout frame, a square and white complexion, red lips, white teeth, a harmonious heart, and a virtuous nature—qualities befitting an official. With auspicious stars, one relies on close kin, and sibling bonds are enduring.

*Verse:*
In the Zi (子) position, a star of fine literature,
A pure heart and an even purer nature.

Those who achieve fame and position do so without toil,
Their reputation resounds throughout the court.

*Verse:*
In the Chou (丑) position, the Celestial Aid reaches Dipper and Ox,
A pure name spreads to the four quarters.
No need to inherit ancestral legacy—
Merit and profit come naturally.

*Verse:*
In the Yin (寅) position, the star of nobility flourishes,
Foundations strong and spirit vigorous.
Though one may not ascend the lunar palace,
Their renown still stirs the hearts of men.

*Verse:*
In the Mao (卯) position, the palace of halls and chambers,
A nature wise and wholly righteous.
Early years may not bring success—
One must wait for late-life nobility.

Mind clear and nature keen.
Not only oneself attains nobility—
Generations enjoy abundant rank.

Glory and splendor endure from beginning to end.
One ascends to a position of importance,
With brothers and descendants excelling in learning.

*Verse:*
In the Wu (午) position, the Celestial Noble stands between Kan and Li,
Marital and familial ties fraught with peril.
In middle age, one illuminates ancestral legacy,
And their name spreads ever farther.

How could one surpass without restraint?
Between Kan and Li, no thorns obstruct—
A lofty person recommends their merit.

*Verse:*
In the Shen (申) position, the Celestial Noble guards Yin and Yang,
Resolute in purpose, upholding principles.
Early years may not bring prosperity—
In later years, their name resounds.

*Verse:*
In the You (酉) position, the Noble rides the Golden Ox,
A person of refined strangeness.
Why fear meager clothing or emolument?
Their reputation echoes through the court.

In the Xu (戌) position, known as the Celestial Physician,
Their name is surely fitting.
In establishing oneself, one seeks noble encounters,
Gradually rising—no need for doubt.

In the Hai (亥) position, the Celestial Gate brims with flourishing qi,
Neither rank nor emolument is trifling.
Surely one becomes an extraordinary person,
Benevolent and truly greatly noble.

The Celestial Seal Star, also called the Imperial Talisman, governs the image of commanding troops and wielding martial authority. When enshrined in the Zi (子) position, flourishing in Chen (辰), rejoicing in Mao (卯), or residing in the Life Palace, it bestows abundant power and fortune. Dwelling in this palace, one commands awe and wields heavy authority. If the Celestial Staff is present, one holds the imperial seal. When meeting auspicious stars, one may attain the destiny of an immortal—or at least ascend to the highest ministerial rank. When meeting malevolent stars, one delights in official posts. With additional anomalies, one may be born of a concubine or lose both parents early. With the Staff and Hair, one holds power. With Punishment, one is cruel and harsh. With Yao, one is licentious. With the Blade, one is orphaned. With Lamentation, one is solitary. When in its proper place, one inherits ancestral legacy; when not, there is no inheritance. When fate’s limits encounter it, one may be swiftly promoted. For women, it grants a sharp appearance and a virtuous nature. In the Palace of Official Emolument, others respect and submit. In the Palace of Wives and Concubines, one’s wife brings wealth. When fate’s flow aligns with its presence, one attains promotion to a prominent position. When the yearly limit meets it, one gains renown, with a person of refined and intelligent appearance, a medium build, and a clear, fair complexion.

*Verse:*
In the Zi (子) position, enshrined, it bestows authority,
A benevolent and magnanimous aura.

The course of action and concealment is ultimately predestined; observe its dwelling in days to come.

*Verse:*
In the Chou (丑) position, the Seal Star approaches the Dipper constellation—
Fame and profit may initially prove difficult.
In middle age, one must plan far ahead,
For even unto death, honor cannot be attained.

*Verse:*
In the Yin (寅) position, the Seal resides in the Human-and-Horse wall—
Encountering it, the aura is magnanimous.
One’s foundation must rely on ancestors,
Yet good opportunities arise of their own accord.

*Verse:*
In the Mao (卯) position, Mao approaches the Mao office—
Temperament and nature are gentle and kind.
One’s livelihood should not depend on ancestors;
Only through self-reliance does brilliance begin to shine.

*Verse:*
In the Chen (辰) position, the Seal falls into the Chen palace—
Though perilous, it does not reach misfortune.
The foundation must stand alone,
And in old age, the household flourishes.

*Verse:*
In the Si (巳) position, this star lies in the realm of severance—
Family fortunes begin in solitude and poverty.
Without the support of marriage or kin,
Only in later years does spring arrive.

*Verse:*
In the Wu (午) position, the Seal Star inclines toward Wu—
Upright yet beset by many disputes.
Action and concealment must find peace,
Yet affairs sought come but slowly.

*Verse:*
In the Wei (未) position, the Seal’s origin favors relocation—
As if not confined to a chessboard’s bounds.
Opportunities may yet fail,
And only in late life does all become fitting.

*Verse:*
In the Shen (申) position, one delves into the mysteries of yin and yang—
In middle age, strength is surely attained.
Through one’s own efforts, profit and renown arise,
And in old age, fragrance endures.

*Verse:*
In the You (酉) position, the Seal enters the Metal Ox office—
Gains and losses drift like distant clouds.
Knowing fate, one guards with care,
And only then may the path of poverty be planned.

*Verse:*
In the Xu (戌) position, the Celestial Seal enters the White Ram—
The heart’s terrain expands broadly.
To honor oneself, one must stand alone,
And not treat this as commonplace.

*Verse:*
In the Hai (亥) position, the Celestial Auspice appears—
Brilliant and clear, the Dao and righteousness flourish.
Breaking through the osmanthus of the moon,
One becomes a pillar of the court.

The Star of Longevity, also called the Old Man or Venerable Father.
When this star resides in the south, it is the Old Man Star; when guarding the wall formation, it governs long life.
In the Hai palace, it is at its temple; in You, at its peak; in Yin, at ease—within the life palace, it bestows high fortune and extended years, a love of goodness and hidden virtue, with blessings in old age.
Dwelling in this palace, one gains fortune through longevity; when in temple or at peak, it is especially noble.
If residing in You, one is free from disaster from youth.
With the Staff, one holds authority; with the Fur, one breaks from ancestors; with Punishment, one governs the punishment palace.
In a fallen palace, early death; when guarding the Void, Separation, or Lamentation, it is inauspicious.
When the main star aligns with its influence, one may die within three days.
When the Longevity Star meets Lamentation or Void, it is called "fallen and weak," and longevity is never attained.
For women, it brings good fortune.
The four stars—Void, Separation, Blade, and Lamentation—govern early death, as well as harm to flesh and blood, adoption, or marrying into another family.
In the Palace of Official Emolument, one acts with foresight and compassion.
When the yearly limit is free from inauspicious stars’ interference or entanglement, it brings double honor in fortune and nobility.
The person is tall, with a composed appearance, an ancient and steadfast character, selfless in action, patient

At Wu, one is called "Elegant and Solitary Listener," with a lofty name that admits no decline.
Should one inquire when official rank and fame will be achieved, look to the time when the hair turns white.

**Tuan says:**
At Wei, one does not enter the village of Wei to seek fame and profit, for such pursuits are slow to unfold.
Only after enduring trials and tempering does one’s name become fragrant in later years.

**Tuan says:**
At Shen, the aged see the Kun Palace, where achievements in career and enterprise are hard to accomplish.
Flowers bloom and wither again, yet the roots remain abundant in old age.

**Tuan says:**
At You, longevity enters the You Palace, and one may ultimately reach the celestial thoroughfare.
Official rank and fame must be attained independently; promotion need not be sought.

**Tuan says:**
At Xu, the White Sheep and Fish Stars rest securely, and one’s life and fate are certain to gain office.
With both fame and profit, why fear the many difficulties of affairs?

**Tuan says:**
At Hai, the flourishing palace of the Morning Court, the talented and outstanding are composed in nature.
Their writings crown the world, and by middle age, their positions are exalted.

The Red Bird Star, also known as the Great Yin, Heavenly Surprise, Auspicious Phoenix, and Crying Phoenix.
When this star is propitious, it is the Red Bird; when enraged, it becomes Ketu.
As a star near the imperial court, it governs official emolument.
In terms of structural patterns: when positioned at Hai, it forms the "Moon Illuminating the Celestial Gate" pattern, indicating nobility.
When the Red Bird enters its temple, and the Emolument Origin shines upon the life and fate palaces, it forms the "Dragon Gate High Promotion" pattern, signifying nobility.
When the temple is joyful and the star flourishes in the official palace, or when in the Chou temple it meets the "Entering Temple" pattern and shines upon the life and fate palaces, it governs a gentle nature, clear dignity, a love for fine clothing, indulgence in wine and sensual pleasures, fondness for friends, and much support from yin persons, as well as attracting a wealthy wife.
Residing in this palace, one is gentle in nature, with a refined and courteous appearance, beautiful and elegant, composed in action, and fond of fine delicacies.
If met by malevolent stars and afflicted by the Rod, one is fierce in nature and holds authority.
If afflicted by the Hair, one is lewd and lustful.
If afflicted by the Blade, one brings disgrace upon others.
If afflicted by the Strange, one abandons ancestors, and women may become unchaste or turn to prostitution.
If afflicted by Yao, one becomes a jealous wife; if not expanding, one suffers hardship or becomes a concubine.
Men afflicted by Punishment face peril in achieving fame, but early loss of attendants and reliance on flesh and blood may lead to punishment.
If all stars are favorably positioned, one’s talents stand out, capable of governing the realm for the state, with learning surpassing others and the ability to manage enterprises.
If the stars are unfavorably positioned, one may enter the empty gate (monastic life) and endure hardship.
If afflicted by Yao and Hair, one indulges in wine and sensual pleasures.
If in decline, one achieves nothing.
Women are beautiful but hot-tempered, with yin toxicity, and may receive titles.
When the temple is joyful and the star flourishes, one is perceptive, discerning, and skilled in household management, with a cheerful nature.
If met by auspicious stars, one is noble; if met by malevolent stars, one is unvirtuous.
When entering the temple, one is born following an extraordinary dream.
In the Palace of Official Emolument, one delights in rites, music, benevolence, and righteousness, acting not recklessly and holding authority.
When seen in the Palace of Brothers, one’s sons and nephews achieve success.
When encountered in the cycles of fortune and yearly limits, extraordinary blessings arise.
One is handsome and elegant, intelligent and clever, graceful and amiable.
Of the three—romance, wine, and gambling—one is certain to indulge in at least one.

**Tuan says:**
When the Red Bird guards the life palace, the face is square, the brows and eyes distinct, a handsome gentleman.
With red lips and white teeth, one’s life is gentle yet firm.

**Tuan says:**
Women most favor the Great Yin Star, with intelligence, resourcefulness, and a clear nature.
Their moods are unpredictable and hard to provoke; they can attract noble sons and bring honor to their husbands.

**Tuan says:**
At Zi, the Auspicious Phoenix brings scholarly honor, holding power with a certain reputation.
Throughout life, one faces no peril, leaping over the three layers of Yu’s waves.

**Chou**
Though one’s appearance be plain, nobility knows no peer—wealth and rank both have their causes.
Fret not the dangers ahead; you shall stride smoothly into the radiance of a wise lord.

**Tuan says:**
**Yin**
In Yin, one excels in dignity, with a nature that soars by heaven’s design.
Friends delight in wine and beauty; elegance and refinement are freely bestowed.

**Tuan says:**
**Mao**
In Mao, the Red Bird brings joy—mind clear, courage bold, and ambition soaring.
Though not inheriting ancestral literary grace, one rises to exalted rank with solemn grandeur.

**Tuan says:**
**Chen**
In Chen, the golden chessboard awaits—proudly stands the true man.
Stillness is not mere stillness; in quiet seclusion, one delights in boundless freedom.

**Tuan says:**
**Si**
In Si, the position is called Celestial Fullness—a solitary jade, ruled by the moon’s light.
Yet mark how loyalty and integrity endure; in twilight years, glory shall at last unfold.

**Tuan says:**
**Wu**
The Red Bird claims the Wu position—women ever find their wishes fulfilled.
Men proceed in steady course; by middle age, honor and nobility arrive.

**Tuan says:**
**Wei**
The Bird enters the realm of the Great Crab—solitary, yet two daughters attend.
Households stand divided; yet in old age, splendor redoubles.

**Tuan says:**
**Shen**
The Bird does not enter Shen’s domain—renown remains unproclaimed.
Wives are hindered, children thwarted; kin part early as stars of Shen and Shang.

**Tuan says:**
**You**
In You, the Red Bird appears—yet joy remains incomplete.
Household fortunes rise and fall; good fortune only then finds its circle.

**Tuan says:**
**Xu**
The Bird enters the White Ram’s home—fond of wine, fond of flowers.
Though midlife brings blessings, late years shine even more resplendent.

**Tuan says:**
**Hai**
In Hai, all accords with human desire—climbing high into the forest of feathered scholars.
Nature knows no bias; in later years, prosperity advances swiftly.

The Star of the Celestial Treasury, also called the Auspicious Star of Heavenly Wealth.
The *Book* states: It is assisted by the Right Assistant, known otherwise as the Handle of the Northern Dipper’s Ladle, or the Auspicious Treasury of Heaven.
Located at the left corner of Lou, it serves as the armory’s repository.
Dwelling within the Purple Tenuity, it is the divine treasury of the Jade Palace.
All treasures, weapons, and reparations depend upon it.
Exalted in Wu, prosperous in Hai, joyous in Ji, delighting in Mao and Wei—when it resides in the Palaces of Life or Destiny, it bestows wealth, nobility, riches, and abundant fields and estates.
If one’s life or destiny aligns with it, nobility may reach the highest councils.
As an official, it governs wealth, yet harms others to benefit oneself.
When conjoined with auspicious stars of staff and seal, it confers nobility.
With few seals of authority, it brings wealth and rank; it delights in the Star of Heavenly Punishment to generate fortune.
When paired with punishment and staff, it grants power; with the Star of Hair, it severs ancestral ties.
Conjoined with solitary stars, it scatters gatherings—such a one may be called a virtuous idler.
With the Star of Strangeness, it indicates a child of a concubine who alters lineage, or one who marries into a peculiar family.
With the Star of Weeping and Punishment, it harms parents, and siblings become as distant as Chu and Qin.
With the Star of Yao, it breeds lust.
With the Star of the Blade, it brings violent death—unless countered by a pressing illness or a protective shell, one may drown in waves.
For women, its presence ensures grace, abundant fortune, and mastery of inner chambers’ decorum.
With the Star of Yao, it portends secret affairs.
In the Palace of Official Emolument, it governs talent, calculation, and wisdom.
When transits illuminate it, wealth arrives—if poor, sudden riches; one’s physique becomes robust.
Women afflicted by the Stars of Hair or Strangeness face peril in childbirth.
For both men and women, it governs the lung meridian, leading to wheezing and fullness—wealth may invite disaster.
All else follows accordingly.

**Tuan says:**

Though the Celestial Treasury is called the Solitary Spirit,
When auspicious stars converge, fame arises.
Most joyous is deliverance in peril—
A life of leisure, a man of ease.

**Tuan says:**
**Zi:** The Celestial Treasury faces the Treasure Vase,
Wandering with false alarms.
Yet when appearance shifts, one stands alone;
All schemes and plans shall surely prosper.

**Tuan says:**
**Chou:** The Treasury enters Chou, solitary and estranged—
Beware the child and wife.
Midway, all turns naturally peaceful;
In later years, fortune arrives in season.

**Tuan says:**
**Yin:** The Celestial Treasury is named the Star of Wealth,
Yet solitude and harm must not be heeded.
The foundation was never good—
Only through striving does honor come.

**Tuan says:**
**Mao:** Shadowed solitude, the heart grows hollow,
Yet windfall wealth abounds.
Plans must be laid by one’s own hand;
In the end, one dwells in the abyss.

**Tuan says:**
**Chen:** The Celestial Treasury fares well in Chen,
Though glory remains obscure.
Like duckweed, one drifts through lands—
Only in late years does prosperity flourish.

**Tuan says:**
**Si:** The Treasury enters Si, strong and firm,
Its roots and shell enduring.
With benevolence and no deceit,
One’s name naturally shines.

**Tuan says:**
**Wu:** The Celestial Treasury arrives in Li,
Its form and manner upright and gentle.
With magnanimity and no selfishness,
Glory, splendor, and abundant fortune follow.

**Tuan says:**
**Wei:** When it descends upon Wei in life and fate,
Benevolence crowns all others.
Only in middle age does strength arise;
In old age, one shall serve the lord.

**Tuan says:**
**Shen:** In Shen, the Celestial Treasury meets the Star of Radiance,
Yet wandering brings no ease.
One roams the world—
Only upon return does age bring maturity.

**Tuan says:**
**You:** The Treasury Star resides in You,
Its depths obscure—yet how could there be no achievement?
Success does not come from ancestors;
When the time comes, one stands in clarity.

**Tuan says:**
**Xu:** The Celestial Treasury enters the White Ram,
The household’s fortunes must transform.
With kindness and no greed or cruelty,
One’s reputation spreads far and wide.

**Tuan says:**
**Hai:** The Treasury Star descends upon Hai,
One establishes the family’s renown.
A name above the multitude—
What fear of failing to achieve great deeds?

*Purple Star Astrology, Scroll Three*

**Chain Lock Star**, also called the **Treasure Vault**, is the deity of the linked rope. Its alternate names include: **Sudden Wealth**, **Entangling Snare**, **Long Cord**, **Celestial Pardon**, **Celestial Net**, and **Ketu**. This star bears eight names and resides before the Northern Dipper, governing law and restraining violence. When its gate opens, it brings litigation and imprisonment; when it bestows grace, it heralds sudden joy and favorable configurations. The **Entangling Star** presides over penal bonds. If it conjoins the **Body** or **Destiny Palace**, it forms the **Linked-Rope Body-Penalty Configuration**, inviting idle troubles and disputes. When exalted in **Wei**, at peak strength in **Ji**, or joyous in **Hai**, **Mao**, or **Wu**, it bestows abundant wealth upon the Body or Destiny Palace. If it illuminates the Body, Destiny, or annual luck periods, it ensures ample resources, yet one remains entangled in worldly concerns, unable to find peace.

Whenever this star aligns with the **Celestial Treasury** in any palace, and auspicious stars converge, misfortune deepens—yet sudden pardons may dissolve calamities like water. If it meets the **Luan Penalty**, wealth flourishes; if it encounters malevolent stars, litigation multiplies. When afflicted by **Blade** or **Violence**, it portends unnatural death, lewdness, or dissipation. If **Weeping** or **Staff** stars join, early demise follows. Under the influence of evil stars, it brings hanging, suspension, lightning strikes, beast attacks, drifting corpses, maimed limbs, or shattered bodies—leading to a life of toil, devoid of transcendence, marked by pettiness and stinginess.

In the **Official Fortune Palace**, when aligned with the **Celestial Treasury** and embraced by luck periods, it ensures sudden prosperity. If malevolent stars intervene, separation and disputes arise. For women, the same applies—beware of death in childbirth or ruin through lust, though they may excel in household management.

**Tuan says:**
Though the Celestial Treasury is called a solitary spirit,
When auspicious stars converge, fame arises.
Most fortunate is deliverance from peril—
A life of refined leisure, serene and untroubled.

**Zi:** Earth excess brings rise and fall—
Black Paths breed sorrow, resentment, and venomous husbands,
Yet they hoard every trifling gain, accumulating surplus.

**Chou:** Self-made success—
Yet loneliness and hardship prevail, severing ties with kin,
Like a chicken’s beak, ever grasping, heedless of windfalls.

**Yin:** Sudden demise—
Curses and malice abound, lacking kindness or filial duty,
Seeing profit, they forget old pacts, betraying virtue for gain.

**Mao:** Wealthy yet afflicted—
Lame limbs, wind-borne ailments, devoid of warmth or propriety,
Lacking human decency, their conduct befits beasts, without the depth of water or wood.

**Chen:** First ruin, then success—
Mourning and misfortune at the door, thunderous shocks from tigers.
Proceed with utmost care—only cautious alliances ensure strength,
Unsought blessings arrive late, like a caged bird.

**Si:** Established amidst peril—
The power of seals and emoluments, the image of official rank,
Joy in the Taiyi Palace: tigers retreat, halls stand secure,
The lord’s favor brings the minister’s peace, their virtue renowned in the court.

**Wu:** The Star flourishes in Wu—
Wealth and emoluments remain unscathed, yet wife and children become illusions.
Evil conjunctions invite calamity; auspicious rays meet obstruction,
They chase trifles, unaware of impending betrayal.

**Wei:** Solitary and scattered, yet gathering—
Penal bonds and solitude sever ties with kin,
Without malevolent stars, fortune prevails—yet the heart strays from the law,
The body pursues profit, lost in its path.

**Shen:** Aligned with the Killing Palace—
Schemes and poisons lurk in shadows, harming without loss of fortune,
Self-inflicted ruin, tainting the good with filth.

**You:** Self-made in You—
When the Chain Lock enters the Earth Palace, wives and concubines grow estranged,
Mothers are doomed, mourning arrives—
Fortune and misfortune diverge, their fates mournful.

**Xu:** Hardship in Xu—
The Celestial Right Star nears nobility, bestowing robes and emoluments,
Yet evil may lead to self-strangulation—
How different is this from burglary? What separates it from robbery?

**Hai:** Pure and noble in Hai—
A wandering official’s fortune, the blessings of solitude and emptiness,
In the realm of the Double Fish, when Body and Destiny converge,
Affairs of the Golden Horse and Jade Hall unfold.

**Literary Star**, also called the **Terrace Assistant**, governs imperial examinations, scholarly brilliance, and literary grace. Known as **Tiankui**, **Three Terraces**, **Phoenix Pavilion**, **Celestial Marvel**, **Wenqu**, and the **Six Officers of the Southern Dipper**, it presides over nobility, learning, and celestial emoluments. In configurations, when **Wenqu** is exalted or at peak strength, it forms the **Laurel and Kui Ascendancy**. When joyous in **Wu** or **Xu** within the Body or Destiny Palace, it bestows later literary excellence, high ranks, and the path to generalship or ministerial office. When exalted and illuminating any palace, it grants eloquence and literary talent, ensuring success in imperial examinations. In exaltation, it bestows extraordinary intellect, mastery of classical texts, and the potential for generalship or ministerial roles. Wherever it resides, affairs are conducted with elegance. When meeting auspicious stars, it heralds great nobility and literary fame. If malevolent stars intervene, early ambitions falter, and one may be born of a concubine. Afflicted by **Blade** or **Penalty**, it breeds arrogance and cruelty. Under **Blade**, it brings malice, harm to parents, discord among siblings, and a life of emptiness. With **Mao Tou**, it severs ancestral ties. Under **Penalty**, it fosters ruthlessness, inviting disaster. With **Weeping**, it brings harm and loss. With **Yao Yi**, it leads to licentiousness. Even when conjoined with other stars, it is called a solitary spirit. In its place of strength, it bestows unmatched purity and nobility, benevolence, integrity, and unwavering trust. Out of its element, it breeds arrogance, aloofness, reclusion, and solitude. For women, it incites lust. With **Mao** or **Yao Yi**, it marks a base and vulgar person; with **Penalty** or **Blade**, cruelty ensues.

In the **Official Fortune Palace**, it fosters propriety and blessings, avoiding idle matters. In the **Servants Palace**, intelligence falls short of the servants’. In the **Children Palace**, meeting celestial nobility ensures descendants’ prominence. When illuminating luck periods or annual cycles, all is auspicious.

**Tuan says:**
**Zi:** Solitary in Zi, marriage delayed—
If the wife arrives early, long life is forfeit.

**Tuan says:**
**Chou:** In Chou, fame shines—
Even if not noble, wealth is assured.
In later years,
Great talents come to fruition.

**Tuan says:**
**Yin:** Wenqu sits in Yin—
Who can match its brilliance?
With auspicious stars converging,
Fortune unfolds naturally.

**Mao:** In Mao, the **Academy Star** resides—
Vain and perilous, fame remains unseen.
Talent blooms like a dream,
Only in old age does affection arise.

**Tuan says:**

**Chen:** In Chen, emotions run fierce and proud,
Solitary and lofty, reputation soars.
If the **Four Cardinal Stars** align,
Greed and cruelty shall not endure.

**Tuan says:**

**Si:** A refined and literary star,
Body solitary, nature pure.
Should it fall into noble hands,
Marriage drifts like duckweed on water.

**Tuan says:**

**Wu:** In Wu, ascending to **Celestial Terrace**,
Meeting others brings wealth.
Name fragrant as osmanthus,
Golden seal gleams beneath the **Three Sophoras**.

**Tuan says:**

**Wei:** In Wei, known for solitude,
Though lofty, the heart remains carefree.
Strange branches yet bear fruit,
Monks and Daoists find purity and fortune.

**Tuan says:**

**Shen:** In Shen, the **Solitary Star** dwells,
A bright mind ensures honor.
Cultivating literature brings wealth,
Even in old age, prosperity endures.

**Tuan says:**

**You:** In You, the fate is kind,
Upholding goodness with auspicious stars.
Otherwise, as monk or Daoist,
Robes of purple bring glory.

**Tuan says:**

**Xu:** The **White Ram** finds its place,
Reputation spreads far and wide.
Entering the court, three ranks await,
Exiting, military command beckons.

**Tuan says:**

**Hai:** The **Literary Star** stands strong,
Even misfortune cannot harm.
Pity the heavy bones,
For late in life, foundations flourish.

The **Celestial Fortune Star**, named **Shanxiang**, is the **Imperial Decree’s Auspicious Spirit**. This star, among the three lodges of **Fang** and **Xu**, aligns with the northern and southern **Dipper**. It governs **imperial carriages**, **public affairs**, **sacrificial rites**, and the offices of **Minister** and **Attendant**. It signifies **lofty brilliance** and **profound fortune**. When exalted in **Mao**, flourishing in **Yin**, or joyous in **Shen** within the **Life Palace**, it grants **longevity**, **minimal illness**, **success in endeavors**, and **ninefold contentment**, with **yin forces** aiding. In **high and strong palaces**, it ensures **late-life blessings**, **fulfillment of desires**, and **sevenfold abilities**, enabling **benevolence toward others** and **benefit to all things**. Even with malevolent stars in the same palace, danger brings no peril. Meeting **Mao Yi** suggests **adoption**, **bedchamber inheritance**, or **two families cohabiting**. With **Yao**, fortune mingles with lewdness; with **Mao**, wandering; with **Blade**, cruelty and poison; with **Punishment**, venomous disputes; with **Staff**, frequent beatings; with **Weeping**, orphanhood, **lightning strikes**, **drowning in waves**, **financial ruin**, **beastly harm**, or **loss of ground and power**. For women, its presence is auspicious, but with **Yao**, **Yi**, **Mao**, or **Blade**, it marks **base and corrupt individuals**, leading to **disasters from lust** or **hanging in childbirth**. Beware. In the **Official Fortune Palace**, it ensures **orderly governance**, not recklessness. In the **Migration Palace**, it brings **fulfillment in travel**. When illuminating luck periods or annual cycles, it heralds **smooth success**.

**Tuan says:**
**Zi:** Fortune dwells in the **Precious Vase**,
Livelihood awaits its time.
Amidst danger, danger yet remains—
Pity the hollow name and profit.

**Tuan says:**
**Chou:** In Chou, the **Fortune Star** descends,
Youth often brings calamity.
The household must stand on its own,
Classics and histories all arranged.

**Tuan says:**
**Mao:** **Celestial Fortune** enters **Yin Palace**,
With **Staff** and **Blade**, nobility nears.
Youthful ambitions may falter,
But late in life, all shall align.

**Tuan says:**
**Yin:** Fortune befits the **Mao** and **Yin**,
Concealment or display, as one pleases.
Why fear obscurity in office?
Old age shall bring wonders.

**Tuan says:**
**Chen:** Dwelling in Chen, it brings **rain and moisture**,
Yet fears malevolent stars.
Fame without greed or cruelty,
A heart ever bound to **Dao** and **virtue**.

**Tuan says:**
**Si:** Fortune enters the **Golden Enclosure**,
Intelligent, nature broad and kind.
Compassionate, loving all things,
In youth, it commands the court.

**Tuan says:**
**Wu:** An old tree blooms late,
Early years bring no renown.
With **Prosperity** and **Seal** in place,
Why fear unfulfilled desires?

**Tuan says:**
**Wei:** The **Fortune Star** comes to Wei,
When shall swift advancement arrive?
Without malevolent stars,
White-haired strength endures.

**Tuan says:**
**Shen:** **Celestial Fortune** enters **flourishing life**,
Why fear lack of emolument?
Fame and profit come not by chance,
High authority sees waters clear.

**Tuan says:**
**You:** In You, the **Fortune Star** adds,
Like a flower in the ravine.
If **Punishment** or **Yi** assist,
Grinding flour becomes livelihood.

**Tuan says:**
**Xu:** The **White Ram Palace** excels,
Household rich with fields and cattle.
Great enterprises flourish,
Longevity leads to **ducal rank**.

**Tuan says:**
**Hai:** In Hai, the **Fortune Star** blazes,
Empty glory, no true attainment.
Building a family has its share,
Yet good fortune remains distant.

The **Celestial Emolument Star**, called the **Three Terraces**, assists the **Celestial Kitchen**, **Celestial Wealth**, **Celestial Treasury**, and **Father’s Treasure**. Its star, in the northeast as the **Axe Bird**, is named **Lu Yuan**, governing **prosperous affairs**. Within the **enclosure**, it is the **root of fortune** and the **source of life**, signifying **official emolument** and **auspiciousness**. In **form**, when **Punishment**, **Clash**, **Breaking**, or **Disconnection** occur, or when **Lu** is **exalted in Si**, **templed in Shen**, or **active in Mao**, with **Life Palace in Shen or Mao**, it denotes **benevolence and moderation**. Residing here, **official emolument** arrives unbidden, **wealth and silk** abound. **Enclosing** the **Life Palace** with **nobility**, and free from malevolent stars, it heralds **great nobility**. If ill stars align, one becomes **mediocre**. Meeting **virtuous stars** and **literary stars**, it brings **refined office**. With **Mao**, **civil and military talent**, yet **wealth dissipates**; with **Xu**, **empty fame** and **empty examinations**; with **Yi**, **solitude**; with **Blade**, **slaughter**; with **Yao**, **lewdness**, **quick temper**, and **venom**; in **temple**, **favored concubines**; with **Punishment**, **shouting fortune**, **straightforward nature inciting resentment**, **half-lost limbs**, **estranged siblings**, and **wife meeting misfortune**. For women, it brings **husband’s honor**, **children’s nobility**, and **wealthy ease**. With **Mao** and **Yi**, **multiple marriages**; with **Yao**, **captivity**; with **Staff** or **Blade**, **early death**; with **Weeping**, **hanging**, **self-strangulation**, or **childbirth calamity**; with **Fortune** and **Purple Phoenix**, **profound fortune**, **titles**, and **honors for sons and daughters**. In the **Official Fortune Palace**, it is most auspicious, ensuring **wealth** and **thriving enterprise**. When illuminating luck periods or annual cycles, it brings **unexpected fortune**.

**Tuan says:**

The **Celestial Staff Star**, called **Litigation**, governs penal affairs, attended by **Xuan Shu** (the Dark Warrior), presiding over nets, punishments, and imprisonment. In structural analysis, if the **Celestial Staff** stands alone in the **Official Fortune Palace**, it forms the **Official’s Staff Constellation**, bringing frequent humiliation, disaster, and misfortune. When exalted in **Zi (Rat)**, **Shen (Monkey)**, or **Hai (Pig)**, or in its own palace of **Wei (Goat)**, it brings entanglement in legal nets and punishments—unless rescued by benevolent stars. If afflicted by **Execution** or malignant stars in the same palace, it brings death by beating, or else violent ends: mauling, tiger attack, lightning strike, drowning, or wolf-inflicted wounds. In this palace with **Blade**, it brings violent death; the person is reckless, defiant, and brutally strong-willed. Even when exalted in noble positions, it brings harsh punishments and failure to attain rank. When conjoined with malevolent stars, it brings bloodshed and harm; the person is quick to anger and often beaten. If met by the **Celestial Seal** in the same palace, it grants authority and eminence. With **Purple Fortune**, it brings nobility and longevity, wielding benevolent power and high esteem. When in its **Treasury** and well-placed, it brings wealth and authority. With **Noble Person** in exaltation, it brings fortune and long life. With **Luan**, it brings refined elegance. With **Literary Star**, it brings solitude. With malevolent stars and **Punishment**, it harms parents and maims limbs. With **Quarrel**, it brings strife with spouse and heirs; kin offer little support, bonds lack affection—so too for men and women. With **Yao**, it brings lust; with **Deception**, cunning; with **Weeping**, a fractious nature. With **Blade**, it brings legal execution. For women, it brings a stern, forthright nature, capable in affairs. With auspicious stars, it turns ominous; with **Mao** or **Yi**, it brings remarriage. For men, it brings departure from ancestral home to stand alone. With **Punishment**, it brings misfortune, inciting lawsuits and inviting trouble. When transits or annual cycles align with it, if well-placed, it grants authority; if ill-placed, it brings litigation—its effects are divinely precise.

**Tuan says:**
**Zi (Rat):** Zi embodies celestial might, endowed with towering dignity.
Without inauspicious stars, one strides the heavenly steps.

**Tuan says:**
**Chou (Ox):** Chou is celestial thunder, fame resounding far.
With cautious diligence, even monks and Daoists thrive.

**Yin (Tiger):** When the **Rod** enters Yin, the heart and nature are keen and bright. With auspicious stars, fortune follows; through toil, skill is achieved.

**Tuan says:**
**Mao (Rabbit):** Mao’s position is one of human clash, yet with **Seal**, great prosperity flows. In its subtle, far-reaching applications, success comes only after hardship.

**Tuan says:**
**Chen (Dragon):** Dwelling in Chen, the **Rod** brings misfortune; through labor alone is success achieved. On the post road, life flourishes, and official matters surely prosper.

**Tuan says:**
**Si (Snake):** Si’s position is not to be boasted of—though lofty, the self remains unadorned. Near success, failure often follows; one’s livelihood is tangled as hemp.

**Tuan says:**
**Wu (Horse):** The **Celestial Tiger** enters Wu, bound by toil and hardship. The foundation must be renewed; in old age, it may yet be mended.

**Tuan says:**
**Wei (Goat):** The **Great Fullness** enters Wei’s palace, with a romantic, discerning nature. Early years bring disorder; in later life, one ascends to prosperity.

**Tuan says:**
**Shen (Monkey):** In Shen, there is an **Excess Star**; with **Seal**, longevity and fortune at last flourish. With a calm heart, obstacles yield; in court and hall, one appears composed.

**Tuan says:**
**You (Rooster):** You brings calamity; only with auspicious stars does strength arise. Whether in right or wrong, success or failure, one drifts like duckweed to foreign lands.

**Tuan says:**
**Xu (Dog):** Xu is called the **Distressed Wanderer**; to meet it is to invite chaos. What is built is also broken; only in old age does one begin anew.

**Tuan says:**
**Hai (Pig):** The **Supply Star** enters Hai’s palace, its qi and tuan entirely at ease. In its subtle, far-reaching applications, fame is won and great merit achieved.

The **Celestial Anomaly Star** is also named **Separation, Ruin, Foundation-Breaker, Controller of Strange Omens, Celestial Solitude, Anomalous Womb, Earthly Plunder, Iron Axe, Controller of Strange Portents**. It governs the aberrations and disorders of heaven and earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations, as well as the monstrous births of birds, beasts, grasses, and trees. Those born in the southern ruins often study strange and uncanny matters, their fortunes rising and falling unpredictably. It delights in the Chen, Chou, Wei, and Mao palaces of the **Body** and **Destiny**—here, it severs ancestral ties and severs one from home. When its double influence shines upon a palace, it brings separation and change of surname. If it aligns with benevolent stars in a flourishing or exalted position, fortune follows. But if it shares a palace with malevolent stars in a debilitated position, it breeds deceit, poor judgment of others, and lack of respect. Yet in flourishing positions, it remains auspicious, indicating a fate of illegitimate birth. With malevolent stars, it brings great upheaval; with auspicious stars, unexpected joy. When it enters a flourishing position, it bestows nobility. If it directly illuminates, one may still gain a wife’s wealth. With auspicious constellations, it tightens the bonds of rank, spreading fame across the land. When it meets **Nobility** in a strong position, one’s name blazes with glory, though often accompanied by licentiousness. With **Wenchang**, it brings reputation, but early setbacks. With **Luan**, it brings charm; with **Fortune and Emolument**, enjoyment; with **Seal and Longevity**, power, fortune, and cunning. With **Treasury and Wealth**, sudden rise and swift pursuit; with malevolent stars and **Emptiness**, treachery, deceit, and shamelessness. With **Yao** and the **Nine Punishments**, cruelty and harm befall parents, siblings become like enemies, spouses part, children are lost—like gold in sand, so too for men and women. For women, it brings elopement. In the **Official Career** palace, it brings unusual wealth, but affairs are ever-changing. It should not appear in the **Spouse** palace, where it brings separation and loss, harming the three palaces, leaving one as if nonexistent, beset by illness. With **Yao**, it brings strange ailments. In the **Fields and Estates** palace, it destroys ancestral property. In the **Wealth** palace, it dissipates resources. When encountered in annual cycles or transits, it brings shocking anomalies, misfortune, and financial loss.

**Tuan says:**
When the **Rod** and **Anomaly** align to illuminate the **Destiny** palace, one changes name and surname, finding joy in shared fate. If not an adopted child or born of a concubine, one may yet see parents twice over.

**Tuan says:**
When the **Celestial Anomaly** resides in a flourishing position, all ventures prosper. Plans and undertakings succeed as wished; one must surely innovate and transform the family gate.

**Tuan says:**
**Zi (Rat):** Abandoning ancestors, it is called the **Jade Pool Star**—nature is clever and bright, gaining emolument from the northwest. If it meets malevolent stars, disaster and illness follow. For Daoists and monks, it brings long life; it severs ancestral ties.

**Chou (Ox):** One goes forth to meet noble admiration, with literary fame. If malevolent stars clash or illuminate, it brings disaster, illness, and harm—sons are unfilial, daughters unvirtuous.

**Yin (Tiger):** It governs song, music, and exquisite dance. If malevolent stars clash, one toils in hardship; with auspicious stars, peace follows.

**Mao (Rabbit):** Born of a concubine, nature is cunning yet unfulfilled. With **Mourning** and **Punishment**, kin are left solitary, and one remains poor and lowly.

**Chen (Dragon):** It brings greed for wealth and grain, inviting right and wrong. If no malevolent stars break the three directions, one becomes a renowned scholar, yet severs ancestral ties.

**Si (Snake):** It governs the heroic and talented, with artful literature. The **Jade Maiden** is most favorable; with **Punishment**, men and women gain official rank, and women wear the cap. Often meeting **Treasury and Wealth**, with **Purple** and auspicious stars, fortune follows.

**Wu (Horse):** This palace is not noble; men are clever but fear **Celestial Yao**, with many failures and few successes. Solitary and short-lived, even auspicious stars bring only mediocrity.

**Wei (Goat):** One suffers oppression, with clever schemes and a fair countenance. Ancestral foundations are ruined; with auspicious illumination, one gains a profession. Yet meeting **Longevity** and **Thigh** brings harm to parents, though poverty holds hidden fortune.

**Shen (Monkey):** Fortune and emolument are both complete. Entering the **Purple Forbidden** star, glory and descendants follow; sons gain wives, wealth flourishes, and the household is warm and prosperous.

**You (Rooster):** Following a woman’s whims, one strays high—men leave home, women remarry, and through dissipation, ruin comes.

**Xu (Dog):** It brings harm, punishment, and short life; prison cannot be avoided. Solitary, it severs the six relations; the self remains mediocre.

**Hai (Pig):** Fortune and emolument illuminate the ancestral pivot, governing the court and palace. In the **Fortune and Virtue** direction, fame spreads; meeting **Treasury, Luan, and Purple**, one attains wealth and nobility.

---

The **Mao-Head Star**, also called the **Celestial Broom**, **Interloper**, or **Sweeping Comet**, is a star of ominous portent. When it guards a palace, it brings two years of disaster and famine. Wherever it shines, misfortune follows.

It also portends violent disaster and death. When in **Zi (Rat)** or **Mao (Rabbit)**, it is at its peak; when in **Wei (Goat)** or **Xu (Dog)**, it delights in **Yin (Tiger)** or the **Life Palace**, making one’s nature fierce and violent, rebellious and fond of killing, daring and strong. Wherever it shines upon a palace, misfortune follows. If encountered, the household will lack four walls. When meeting auspicious stars, one gains authority. If conjoined with malevolent stars, it brings calamity. Dwelling in this palace, one must break from ancestors, though affairs proceed swiftly. When in its temple or at peak strength, it governs military authority, surely raising banners, standards, and battle-axes. Meeting auspicious stars with nobility in its temple, one attains official emolument and illustrious glory. Conjoined with **Fortune and Virtue**, one breaks from ancestors to establish a household. Conjoined with **Seal and Longevity**, one gains glory and long life. Conjoined with **Wenchang**, one remains pure and solitary. Conjoined with **Treasury**, one is truly wealthy and prosperous. Meeting malevolent stars with **Punishment and Blade**, one harms parents, siblings, wife, and children. It also portends early death in one’s prime. Conjoined with **Punishment**, one is fond of killing; with **Void**, one suffers poverty, cold, and many disasters; with **Weeping**, one becomes a shaman, physician, or one of the nine humble trades, and dies away from home. Conjoined with **Void and Weeping**, one suffers epidemics. When **Three Stars**, **Void Star**, or malevolent stars reside in the **Life Palace** with **Mao**, it foretells a violent and early death. It also portends greed, lewdness, and lust. Meeting **Treasury**, one establishes oneself independently, often staying abroad—if a monk or Daoist, one dies in a foreign land.

In the **Official Emolument Palace**, one fears nothing, sets firm resolve, and makes decisions without doubt. In the **Migration and Fortune Palaces**, one avoids peril and hardship. When transiting or annual stars shine upon it without auspicious stars, one suffers official disasters, water calamities, and extraordinary misfortunes. For women, it is the same, portending childbirth difficulties and weakness in the lungs. If meeting auspicious stars to assist, one may gain or lose fortune through licentiousness, inviting disaster. Conjoined with **Weeping and Blade**, the six relations grow cold and distant.

**Verse:**
In **Zi**, with intent and courage to uphold,
Born at night with auspicious stars, one suffers a fierce wife and many concubines.
A concubine meeting **Celestial Fortune** gains **Purple Tenuity** and wealth.
In **Chou**, with **Fortune and Virtue**, misfortune turns to blessing.
Meeting **Changing Emolument**, one achieves fame and wealth through words and writing—auspicious when in temple or at peak strength.
In **Yin**, one holds authority, granaries overflow, outwardly full but inwardly empty.
Meeting auspicious stars, one is skilled and wealthy, with doubled fortune and nobility.
In **Mao**, one holds heavy office, a scholar of the imperial academy.
Meeting auspicious stars, one gains wealth and nobility; conjoined with malevolent stars to clash and break, one suffers poverty.
In **Chen**, one abandons ancestors, harms others, invites strange misfortunes without punishment, and accomplishes nothing.
Meeting malevolent stars, one suffers punishment and poverty.
In **Si**, one is fickle and inconstant, lonely and suffering, without stability, hesitating between advance and retreat, and the six relations offer no support.
In **Wu**, meeting auspicious stars, one gains noble patronage; conjoined with malevolent stars, one fails more than succeeds, and one’s endeavors are futile.
In **Wei**, one often lacks kinship ties and must leave ancestors to succeed.
Meeting **Celestial Fortune**, **Treasury**, or **Luan**, one gains wealth; if malevolent stars clash, it is inauspicious.
In **Shen**, one is seductive and skilled in poisonous arts.
Meeting malevolent stars, one suffers lifelong poverty, breaks from ancestors, and leaves home; meeting auspicious stars, one gains emolument and longevity.
In **You**, one breaks from ancestors and labors in worry.
Meeting malevolent stars, one dies young and meets no good end; meeting auspicious stars, one may avoid misfortune and find good fortune.
In **Xu**, one breaks from ancestors but turns misfortune to good, gaining much wealth in later years.
Meeting auspicious stars, one ascends as if by cloud ladder; meeting malevolent stars, it is inauspicious.
In **Hai**, one is beset by doubt, fear, and alarm.
Meeting malevolent stars, one’s fortunes fluctuate, gains and losses are uncertain; meeting good stars, it is auspicious.

The **Celestial Blade Star**, also called **Hanging Needle of Bloodshed**, is a star of metal, another name for the **Seven Killings** deity. In the **Purple Tenuity Enclosure**, it governs matters of yin virtue but also brings harm and injury. In structural analysis, when it resides in the **Life Palace** of men or women alongside **Blade** and **Treasury**, forming the **Zi Blade Purple Configuration**, it surely destroys the household. When in its temple in **Si (Snake)** or **Shen (Monkey)**, at peak strength in **Wu (Horse)**, or delighting in **Yin (Tiger)** or the **Life Palace**, one’s nature is cruel and wolfish, fond of killing and slaughter, often dying by the blade in battle. Wherever it shines upon a palace, it governs the authority of war and punishment. Meeting malevolent stars, one suffers injury and ruin; meeting auspicious stars, one harms others in silence but can resolve matters favorably. When in its temple and conjoined with auspicious stars, one holds military authority but cannot avoid falling in battle, suffering blood diseases, or being exiled, surely enduring flogging, humiliation, and penal servitude. Meeting auspicious stars with **Purple Tenuity**, misfortune is half reduced. Conjoined with **Treasury** or **Luan**, one has wealth but often dies by hanging, drowning, or beast-inflicted injury. Conjoined with **Seal** or **Longevity**, one may have illness but survive; otherwise, one dies young. Conjoined with **Wenchang**, one holds authority but remains solitary. Conjoined with **Luan**, one is harmed by lust. Conjoined with **Nobility**, one holds authority but meets no good end. Conjoined with **Fortune and Emolument**, one’s fortune is incomplete. Conjoined with **Punishment**, one dies violently. Conjoined with **Mao**, one dies young. Conjoined with **Yao**, one is lewd and dies young. Conjoined with **Void**, one is insubstantial and deceitful; with **Weeping**, one is solitary and harms others. For women, it portends difficult childbirth, strange postpartum illnesses, and weakness in the lungs. In the **Official Emolument Palace**, one’s nature is fierce and violent, not harming others. In the **Migration Palace**, it is inauspicious to encounter; when transiting or in annual stars, it brings sudden disasters and misfortunes—only families that accumulate goodness may avoid them. If conjoined with **Yao** and strange stars, one dies lewdly and young, establishing a separate lineage, and one’s offspring are of a different kind. Neither men nor women should have this star in their **Life Palace**.

**Verse:**
In **Zi**, one indulges in lust, has beautiful women, suffers strange moans and toil, and wanders to the end—yet it is not entirely bad.
In **Chou**, one is drawn to the uncanny, fond of shamans and sorcerers, with flourishing wealth and fields.
Meeting auspicious stars, misfortune is reduced; meeting malevolent stars, one dies by the uncanny.
One practices incantations, writes talismans, and is shamelessly content.
In **Yin**, one dies for lust; women perish from lewdness.
Men are often foolish and dull, mere commoners, with conduct as chaotic as beasts.
In **Mao**, one harms the six relations, suffers from madness and illness, punishes one’s wife, and harms one’s children.
Meeting malevolent stars, one dies young and suffers poverty; even with auspicious stars, it is often mediocre.
In **Chen**, one has ample celestial emolument, but in middle age, one wanders and toils.

A life spent in vain busyness, with wealth and emolument uncertain in abundance.

In **Si**, wealth and emolument dissipate; one dies abroad, leaving descendants orphaned and suffering. Meeting auspicious stars may resolve this, but encountering malevolent stars brings certain harm—the blessings are faint, the misfortunes grave.

In **Wu**, one is solitary and estranged, fond of lust. In the wife’s palace, one consorts with outsiders, yet observes propriety and ritual; still, one harms and severs the six relations, with mourning imminent, visible before one’s eyes.

In **Wei**, the six relations bring harm, and affairs succeed or fail unpredictably. Meeting auspicious stars brings improvement, but if malevolent stars appear, one cannot preserve what one has—all is show without substance.

In **Shen**, evil companions bring harm, though some good may yet arise. Even with auspicious stars overhead, they cannot avert disaster. When the fortune star arrives, misfortune manifests outwardly.

In **You**, one lacks steadfast nature, and actions are often reversed. One’s temperament is unstable, bringing harm and cruel punishments.

In **Xu**, celestial misfortune and fire stars bring abundant wealth and emolument, yet one fears malevolent stars. When the limit meets evil stars, one harms and severs parents, spouse, and children, whose lives are cut short, bringing disaster and illness.

In **Hai**, harm is inevitable in the Hai palace, but emolument and position come through influential women. Those of high rank gain favor and office, their chambers and walls pure in loyalty. The celestial punishment star is called by ten names: Celestial Cannon, Fire Star, Death Talisman, Beginning Strike, Ketu, Void, Fire Virtue, Celestial Dog, Celestial Authority, and Celestial Harm. These are alternate names for Ketu, which opposes Rahu and is also called the Celestial Tail Star, governing military and penal affairs. When the Purple Tenuity faces south, it becomes the constellation of chariot and cavalry generals. Meeting it brings noble fortune, authority, and honor, with loyalty shining like the sun and integrity as unyielding as frost. It governs official disasters in structural fate, and when the execution star resides in the brothers’ palace, it forms the Broken Goose pattern. Together with Void and positioned in Mao, it is called the Sitting Thunder Gate pattern. When in its temple in Yin, flourishing in Chen, joyful in You, or in the Wu palace of the body and life palaces, it governs temperament, often redressing others’ injustices. If it illuminates this palace, it brings violent death; even with benevolent stars to mitigate, one may still face exile. If aligned with the Red Thread, flourishing in its temple, one avoids the calamity of imprisonment. In Xu, all is connected; if it loses its position, legal death is certain, and one will surely suffer from lameness, hunchback, or ailments of the waist, legs, or back. If it gains a favorable position, misfortune is lightened. When meeting auspicious stars and the Purple Tenuity in its proper place, one’s reputation and status are noble and weighty. If it loses its position, one still suffers illness, disaster, and injury. When aligned with nobility, one achieves prominence; with Literary Brilliance, one is in its temple and becomes solitary; with Treasury or Thread, one gains fame through wealth; with Seal and Longevity, one holds power; with Phoenix, one possesses civil and martial talent; with Fortune and Emolument, one is not entirely complete; with Hair, one is disfigured and fond of martial arts; with Staff, one holds authority. If in Void, one is poor and thin, yet must have a reputation, though it is more hollow than substantial. With the Strange star, one is adopted or becomes a son-in-law; with Blade, one faces exile or penal servitude; with Hair and Blade, one dies prematurely. For women, it brings harm to husbands and children, the decline of the maternal family, and the perils of childbirth and weakness. With the Yao star, one is wanton and elopes; with the Strange star, one remarries; with Phoenix, one brings fortune and emolument to her husband and receives honors; with Longevity, one enjoys a long life. If the official emolument palace meets auspicious stars, the migration palace faces dangers of water, fire, bandits, and thieves. When the flow of fortune and the year’s limit encounter it, one suffers disasters and losses.

In **Zi**, the Zi palace brings sorrow; meeting malevolent stars brings punishment and harm, poison and obstruction, short life, severed six relations, and persistent illness.

In **Chou**, the Chou palace brings much harm, greed for wealth, and ruin. Malevolent limits sever both parents, and early success leads to later ruin.

In **Yin**, the martial Yin, dwelling as the Tiger’s Might, resides in the temple of seals and emoluments. As a favored minister, one lives in ease; as a wild goose tower, one surely attains the Secretariat. If struck by malevolent stars, men harm their wives and children, while women become stern and widowed, with few children before thirty and youthful afflictions of thick blood.

In **Mao**, one suffers from waist and eye ailments, punishment, and harm, unable to find peace. Monks and Daoists may fare well, but one’s life is solitary and lonely.

In **Chen**, the Chen palace harbors a treacherous heart; when granted office, one encounters the terror of tigers and snakes. Punishment and misfortune bring injury and death—only meeting auspicious stars like the Rabbit brings relief.

In **Si**, the Si palace harms wives and children; the unyielding Luo and Gang stars bring extraordinary harm. Success and failure have no fixed time, and one is born with a hasty and rigid temperament.

In **Wu**, one dies abroad, meeting an early end, cursed by malevolent and wicked people. One harms wives and children, severs the six relations, and should blame oneself more than others.

In **Wei**, the Wei palace mixes good and ill fortune, with wives and children changing two or three times. The six relations suffer harm, one must break from ancestors, and leaving home to become a monk or Daoist may bring long life.

In **Shen**, the Shen palace brings yin poison and punishment, severing parents in early years. Without the aid of auspicious stars, disasters and dangers are anything but ordinary.

In **You**, the You palace surely brings punishment and harm; in civil or martial pursuits, one’s wives and children are doomed. In youth, one loses parents and suffers illness, meeting an early end.

In **Xu**, when pacifying the frontier in times of war, the Xu palace’s emolument star belongs to the three auspicious directions. If one’s name must be achieved alone, success comes without scheming.

In **Hai**, the Hai palace brings solitude and hollow emolument, yet literary talent severs worldly ties. Stirring heaven and moving earth, celestial emolument naturally arrives.

The Celestial Yao star is called the Celestial Debauchery and Mysterious Harlot, governing music, peach blossoms, and the collision of hairpins, a constellation of wind, flow, seduction, and absurdity. When this star resides in the palace enclosure, it specializes in lewd and filthy affairs. In structural fate, when positioned in Zi, it forms the Flower Essence Treasure King pattern, governing lewdness and chaos. Flourishing in Mao, Xu, and Chen, joyful in Hai, and in the body and life palaces, it governs a yin-poisoned temperament, chaotic and suspicious, with a fondness for beauty but shallow fortune. If in its eight temples and flourishing, one is wealthy and noble, with many servants. In Hai, it is called the Ascending Clarity Palace, possessing talent that surpasses the age.

When encountering auspicious stars, one indulges in flowers and wine. When meeting malevolent stars, one ruins family and career, suffers punishment or death due to lust. In the Six Harmonies, one dies young. If residing in the Life Palace in decline, marriage occurs without deliberation, hand-in-hand unions form; meeting auspicious stars adds longevity, with long life; in the Treasury, wealth; in the Purple Palace, hardness and softness balance, with charm; in the Noble Palace, many delusions and concubines; in the Phoenix, lewdness; meeting inauspicious stars brings misfortune; in the Punishment Blade Palace, harm to parents and wife and children; in the Sibling Palace, disorder like crows in flight; with the Staff, fondness for beauty; near nobility, often reduced to servitude, scribes and clerks; with the Strange, ancestral lewdness and lowly solitude; with the Hair, ancestral ruin through lewdness, or heedless of others’ words; with the Weeping, cruelty and poison; in the Official Salary Palace, much emptiness and little substance, ensnaring others; in the Illness and Misfortune Palace, not to be seen, governing strange illnesses and violent harm, bodily damage from lust and wine. In fate and fortune, all are inauspicious. Residing in its temple brings fortune, with beautiful appearance and elegant bearing, charming and cunning, full of schemes, often inciting disputes, indulging in wine, lust, extravagance, and gambling—this is the foremost trait. Men under its influence are all thus. Women with the Weeping and Hair stars suffer hanging or death in childbirth.

**Judgment:**
**Zi:** The Zi Palace’s Mourning Guest governs cunning and intrigue, scheming and early death, leaving one orphaned. Women become lowly prostitutes, harming children and husbands.
**Chou:** The Weeping star in the Chou Palace brings awe-inspiring severity, literary and martial nobility with authority. Meeting malevolent stars brings high rank; in the nine schools, medical skill excels. This star, when used in civil or military roles, makes one a prime minister or feudal lord—if not struck by malevolent stars, one becomes a master of the nine schools.
**Yin:** The Yin Palace invites crime and punishment, imprisonment and official calamity. When inauspicious stars clash, one suffers orphanhood and poverty, unable to amass wealth. This star early harms parents, shortens life with severe illness; in the Life Palace, it is inauspicious. If aided by auspicious stars, fortune and prosperity flourish.
**Mao:** Fierce and lustful, with auspicious stars it reverses to fortune. Wealth and salary flourish, but malevolent stars bring ruin.
**Chen:** The Breaking Army’s fierce and robust image—if the three directions meet malevolent stars, one harms parents, lives as an illegitimate child dependent on relatives.
**Si:** The Si Palace brings blade wounds and poison harm to life. Meeting Heavenly Fortune or Heavenly Staff reduces harm by half; women become widows. Meeting the Red Phoenix, one is harmed by lust and dies in a foreign land.
**Wu:** Literary talent with a reputation, meeting opportunity brings noble rank, official prominence, and fine robes. Inauspicious turns auspicious; the Star of the Hanging Net governs shamans, physicians, monks, and Daoists.
**Wei:** Governs charm, blood illness, and death; if the Official Salary Palace aids, one still dies young. Meeting the Red Phoenix star reduces harm by half.
**Shen:** Defies norms, disrupts family order, first ruins then rebuilds. Meeting malevolence brings severe illness, death, and loss of literary grace.
**You:** One’s name is recorded in history, salary and rank rise high. The You Palace’s Arrow Star brings harm from blades and arrows. With malevolent stars, punishment harms the six relations, causing parental death, ruin, orphanhood, and family decline.
**Xu:** Loses position through ferocity; malevolent stars bring official calamity and violence. This palace governs orphanhood, poverty, and misfortune, with evil befalling the body.
**Hai:** The Hai Palace in yin evil dissipates family wealth. Malevolent stars bring official calamity and many deaths in childbirth. If malevolent stars strike, men suffer official misfortune; women endure difficult births. The star’s transit through fate determines fortune or misfortune.

When the Purple Tenuity star guards fate, it brings honor, promotion, and joyous events; commoners’ enterprises prosper, scholars gain reputation, nobles advance in rank, monks and Daoists enjoy pure blessings, and women strengthen their husbands’ families. The three directions of Hai and Mao meeting auspicious stars bring imperial audience and honor; commoners rise in the world.

**Heavenly Void:**
The Heavenly Void is named for emptiness; when its star guards fate, it brings hollow fame, financial loss, and peril, with sudden wealth elusive. There are false alarms, empty joys, mourning for women and children, funerary clothes, and financial ruin. When Punishment, Weeping, Yao, and Blade stars converge, one suffers from swelling and poisoning. Void meeting Punishment and Killing stars in fate brings hidden family misfortune, long-term official restraint, and inauspiciousness in all matters, leading to consumptive weakness. It also governs poverty, orphanhood, and suffering, with life’s good things turning to nothing, all affairs ending in vain—like a dream.

**Heavenly Nobility:**
When the Heavenly Nobility star guards fate, joy is extraordinary, disasters vanish, and fortune prevails. Scholars pass imperial examinations, officials and nobles ascend in rank, commoners prosper in wealth, and monks and Daoists see their robes and alms bowls filled. Women who encounter this star will bring honor to their husbands and amass riches, even receiving titles.
*Verse:*
The Noble star enters fate with boundless joy,
Though trials may come, all turns to good.
Scholars who meet it shall pass the exams,
Officials and nobles ascend the court’s hall.

**Heavenly Seal:**
When the Heavenly Seal star guards fate, nobles swiftly rise to prominence, while commoners establish thriving enterprises. Those of high rank wield the power of three seals, holding life and death in their grasp. If positioned in a flourishing and exalted palace, they command armies and govern the people, wielding military authority. Even ordinary folk who encounter nobility, or monks and Daoists, attain esteemed positions. If not in a dominant configuration but residing in a weak or afflicted palace, they still gain wealth through proximity to the powerful.
*Verse:*
When fate aligns with the Heavenly Seal,
Promotions and honors swiftly reveal.
One office holds seals in layered might,
High rank and fame shine ever bright.

**Heavenly Longevity:**
When the Heavenly Longevity star guards fate, all affairs turn auspicious. Meeting further auspicious stars brings glory, prosperity, and enduring longevity, with disasters dissolved. If the Four Breaks are unopposed, abundant blessings follow.
*Red Phoenix:*
When the Red Phoenix star guards fate, it brings fortune in wealth and rank. Men gain beautiful wives, and women wed worthy husbands. If it meets Wealth and Nobility stars, glory and prosperity abound. If not in its proper palace and further afflicted by celestial anomalies, it brings public and private losses, mourning, unrest, theft, and unexpected calamities.

**Heavenly Treasury:**
When the Heavenly Treasury star guards fate, it brings wealth. If positioned in a flourishing palace, families swiftly grow rich, businesses thrive, and even commoners prosper. Without afflicting stars, those who have long prospered become the era’s Marches of Chen, their fortunes so vast they anchor entire districts, their names synonymous with sudden wealth.
*Verse:*
Within the Heavenly Treasury’s domain,
A decade’s wealth flows without strain.
If outer stars align in grace,
One stands before the royal place.

**Linked Chain:**
When the Linked Chain star guards fate, it brings advancement in wealth and rank. If in the Life Palace, flourishing and meeting the Earthly Lord or Heavenly Treasury, it brings windfall gains. Meeting the Red Phoenix, it brings prosperous fortune and encounters with noble patrons. Triadic alignment with auspicious stars also brings blessings. If triadic alignment involves Literary and Punishment stars, it brings legal disputes and misfortune. If met by auspicious stars, one is released by imperial pardon. If afflicted by malevolent stars, it brings separation, death, lawsuits, family ruin, financial loss, theft, fire, and the scattering of wealth across the four directions, ensnaring resources from all six realms.
*Verse:*
The Linked Chain star governs wealth alone,
With auspicious stars, fortune is shown.
When fate and years align just right,
Treasuries open in full sight.
*Another Verse:*
The Linked Wealth star, a gem so rare,
Born with coffers rich and fair.
When fate and years in union meet,
Wealth fills the gates with joy complete.

**Literary Brilliance:**
When the Literary Brilliance, the Heavenly Fortune star, guards fate, nobles gain imperial audience, officials expand their posts, and commoners acquire fields and estates, their halls radiant and homes renewed. When fate reaches the Hai-Mao-Wei palace, sudden wealth and prosperity arise; monks and Daoists attain purity, while ordinary folk rise swiftly. Women who encounter this star enjoy harmonious husbands and fine children, their silkworms and granaries flourishing. Meeting Nobility and Wealth stars brings titles and honors.

**Heavenly Rod (Tianzhang):**
When the Heavenly Rod star guards fate,
Illnesses arise—consumption, wheezing, foot and heart’s weight,
Chills and fevers, vomiting, falls, and blows,
Official troubles, disquiet, and woes.
Mourning robes, disputes, and strife may follow,
Or confinement in chains, a life hollow.
If the Execution Blade aligns near,
Sudden calamity brings death or fear.
Else, wind-stroke or cold may strike with force,
Leaving breath labored, the body’s course.
If in the Palace of Sickness it resides,
Strange ailments afflict, and suffering abides.
All it touches brings harm, not gain,
With sores, pus, and blood, and endless pain.

**Heavenly Anomaly (Tianyi):**
When the Heavenly Anomaly star guards fate,
Estates disperse, mourning robes accumulate.
Great and small face punishment’s sting,
With strange disasters beneath the home’s eaves clinging.
If joined by Heavenly Maiden, expect moves and loss,
Lawsuits, debts, and disputes—no gain, only cost.
With malevolent stars, life may end,
Or official ruin descend.
If in its temple it resides,
Misfortune lingers, woes abide.
But if three auspicious stars align,
Its harm is checked, its sting benign.

**Hairy Head (Maotou):**
When Hairy Head shines upon one’s fate,
Illness, punishment, and moves await,
With fires, floods, and theft to mar the way,
And restless nights that never stay.
If Void and Wailing stars converge,
Plagues, sores, and burns may surge—
Fire’s wrath or scalding water’s sting,
Or wounds from blades that death may bring.
If Execution stars align in force,
Few blessings come, but ruin’s course.
Mourning robes and deaths may follow near,
With losses vast and woes severe.
Yet if in its temple it stands tall,
With kind stars joining, fortunes call—
Nobility, campaigns, or blades of war,
Or civil ranks to rise once more.
If not in temple, strength, or height,
Disaster strikes with all its might.
But if three auspicious stars appear,
Its harm is checked, its threats disappear.

*Verse:*
The Comet’s Hairy Head brings woe untold,
With plagues and sickness, bodies weak and cold.
If year on year its shadow looms,
Seek prayers and rites to dispel the gloom.

**Heavenly Punishment (Tianxing):**
When Heavenly Punishment guards fate,
Unforeseen official disasters await,
With legal troubles, losses dire,
And water’s perils, drowning’s ire.
Parents may suffer, siblings part,
With broken bonds and heavy heart.
If Maiden or Anomaly align,
Eyes and ears grow dim with pain,
Or bloodshed’s curse may mark the way.
With Wailing stars, fear holds sway—
Illness, terror, partings grim,
With wealth and kin lost on a whim.
If Heavenly Rod joins near,
Official woes bring grief severe.
With malevolent stars in force,
The body bends, its course perverse—
Hunched backs, twisted limbs, and pain,
Or organs failing, breath in vain.
If kind stars share its place,
Evil turns to blessings’ grace.
But with Execution, Wailing, Void,
Life’s thread is cut, fate destroyed.

**Heavenly Blade (Tianren):**
When Heavenly Blade shines bright,
Disaster strikes, wealth takes flight.
Parents and spouse and children too
May face misfortune’s bitter dew.
Illness, punishment, and wounds appear,
With sores, blood, and strange afflictions near.
Women face childbirth’s cruel test,
With abscesses and poisons manifest.
Stay still, avoid ambition’s call,
Lest harm befall and fortunes fall.
Families may see members lost,
With mourning robes and lives exhaust.
If directly or opposingly it glows,
Misfortune follows where it goes.
With Execution stars aligned,
Calamity leaves none behind.
If in the year’s fate it combines,
With malevolent stars in dark designs,
Seven of eight in a household may fall,
Its truth as certain as fate’s call.

**Heavenly Maiden (Tianyao):**
When Heavenly Maiden shines upon one’s fate,
Water’s perils bring ruin and weight.
If joined by Anomaly, expect strife—
Lost wealth, strange woes, and women’s knife,
With entanglements and slander’s sting,
And troubles that no peace may bring.
If in its temple it resides,
Evil turns to blessings’ tides.
But with malevolent stars aligned,
Life’s thread is cut, fate maligned.

*Verse:*
When Heavenly Maiden meets your fate,
With Red Phoenix in years of late,
Unbidden, joy with women flows,
With shared delight in all that grows.

**Heavenly Wailing (Tianku):**
When Heavenly Wailing shines upon one’s fate,
And malevolent stars align in hate,
No escape from fate’s decree remains.
If three directions join its chains,
Exile awaits beyond the door;
With mourning robes, death comes for sure.
If three oppose, the waves will rise;
In life’s palace, the Yellow Springs lies.
If three directions guard one’s fate,
The waves of woe will seal one’s state.

*Verse:*
Waves and tides through ten years’ span,
Even nobles dare not meet this ban.
Direct or slant, its gaze brings dread,
With punishment, life’s thread is shed.
This star’s direct or slanting light
Brings peril, woe, and endless night.
With Wailing and Void in dark array,
Plagues, punishment, and death hold sway.
If Execution and Blade align,
Life’s end is swift, fate’s design.
With Wailing, Anomaly, Maiden near,
Moves, losses, lawsuits bring despair.
If Wailing, Anomaly, Maiden meet,
Lost wealth and sudden woes repeat.

The gravest cases bring only misfortune and calamity.
