**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Sutra on the City God’s Responsive Dispelling of Disasters and Gathering of Blessings**

**Opening Gatha**
With bowed head, I take refuge in the revered City God,
Whose majestic power illumines heaven and earth.
Protecting the nation and stabilizing the realm, upholding the altars of state,
Bestowing sweet rains to succor the people.
Commanding great armies to patrol the world,
Rewarding good and punishing evil, as the sun and moon shine alike.
Upright and impartial, judging life and death,
Dispelling calamity for the licentious and granting fortune to the virtuous, manifesting divine might.
With sincere devotion, I revere and uphold this to dissolve obstacles,
Bringing peace to households and purity to the land.
Now I recite this true sutra as it is revealed,
May boundless grace descend upon all.

At that time, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue, was in the Seven Treasures Palace of the Great Luo Heaven, gathering the hosts of all heavens and earths, the sun, moon, and stars, and the officials of the Three Realms, to broadly expound the supreme, most true, mysterious, and primordial Great Dao. Then wondrous flowers bloomed brilliantly, and jade-like incense filled the air with fragrance.

There was a Perfected One named Vast Benevolence, who held a tablet and knelt in reverence, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: “Your servant observes that all sentient beings in the world suffer myriad afflictions. I humbly beseech the Heavenly Compassion to show mercy and grant deliverance.”

The Heavenly Worthy stroked his table and said: “These beings have committed all manner of evil deeds, sinking into the sea of suffering. Greedy and reckless, they act as they please—disloyal, unfilial, unkind, unjust, irreverent toward the Three Treasures, disrespectful to the gods, using false measures and scales, defiling the Five Grains, cursing heaven and earth, resenting wind and rain, slandering the true Dao, wounding others with harsh words, engaging in debauchery, theft, and murder, slaughtering living beings. Thus they incur guilt and forever lose their human form.”

The Perfected One again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “The beings of the world suffer such tribulations. By what means may they attain deliverance?”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Excellent, excellent! The people below all depend on the City God’s memorials to determine their fate without error. If there are faithful men and women in the world who recite this sutra thirty, fifty, or even a hundred thousand times, they shall immediately dissolve their karmic offenses and enjoy great peace.”

The Lord Lao said: “This spirit stores the essence of heaven and earth, gathers the beauty of mountains and rivers. His majestic power is resplendent, his sagely Dao lofty and luminous. Impartial and unbiased, upright and just, he responds to all prayers as a shadow follows form. Acting on heaven’s behalf, he governs all things, eradicates evil, and eliminates misfortune. Protecting the nation and safeguarding the realm, his merit extends to the altars of state. He universally bestows sweet rains, universally saves the people. Commanding the Eighteen True Offices and overseeing a million divine generals, through accumulated merit and virtuous conduct, he holds the office of City God, wielding authority over the world and presiding over all nations.”

The Perfected One, hearing this, bowed his head in reverence.

**The Great Divine Generals of the Golden Armored Attendants, Left and Right**
**The Divine Martial Generals, Preceding and Following**

The Banner-Holding Golden Lads and Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens,
Together with all divine soldiers, generals, and officials—

At this time, the City God, moved by compassion for all beings in the world, whether afflicted by yearly calamities or monthly misfortunes, obstructed fate or entangled in celestial nets, widowed, orphaned, or solitary, stricken by pestilence or plague, sores, scabies, or leprosy, embroiled in legal disputes or verbal conflicts, lacking descendants, threatened by warfare, flood, or fire, beset by bandits or perilous childbirth—all manner of hardships—if they recite this scripture, I shall swiftly dispatch the Pestilence-Dispelling Envoys and the Pestilence-Collecting Saints to expunge their names from the Register of Sins and forever eradicate the roots of evil.

Thereupon, the Perfected One addressed the Heavenly Worthy again, saying: If in the world there are good men and good women who broadly accumulate hidden merit, practice all manner of expedient means, donate wealth to relieve distress, cherish the elderly and pity the poor, revere the Three Treasures, honor and support their parents, remain loyal to their sovereign, value food and clothing, live in harmony with their six relations, refrain from wrongdoing, observe fasts and uphold the Dao, their names shall be inscribed in the Register of Goodness, their virtues recorded on the Cinnabar Terrace, their blessings and longevity increased, their families prosperous and illustrious for generations, their descendants flourishing without end.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The City God, august deity, wields true and weighty authority, manifesting boundless transformations. When prayers for rain are offered, sweet showers revive the withered and crops ripen; when prayers for sunshine are made, yin transforms into yang, and skies clear at once.

If there are good men and good women who single-mindedly devote themselves, contemplating the Dao and meditating on the True, and on the Three Primes, Eight Festivals, the birthdays of all divine sages, the new and full moons, or their own propitious birthdays, observe fasts, recite scriptures, and perform all manner of meritorious deeds, they shall attain peace and happiness in this life, their fields of blessing expanded, their gates flourishing and clans noble, their glory resplendent and prosperity secure. Officials shall ascend to loftier ranks, merchants shall amass greater wealth, voyages shall be free from the terror of waves, and journeys on land shall be safe and serene. All within the dusty world shall fall under his governance.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke this gatha:

Great is the City God, truly born of Heaven’s virtue.
Rainbow streams through radiant isles, mountains and peaks bestow their numen.
Receiving Heaven’s mandate, he governs all states,
presiding over life and death, his retributions clear and just.
Rewarding good and punishing evil, not erring by a hair’s breadth,
his clarity rivals sun and moon, his virtue parallels Heaven and Earth.
The imperial capital stands solemn and tranquil, no treachery arises;
he averts disasters, resolves hardships, protects the realm and brings peace to the people.
In the great capital’s sacred precinct, his temple’s majesty commands reverence.
The state honors its rites, rituals refined and precise.
All under Heaven revere him, the realm turns to him in devotion.
Warding off calamities and defending against misfortune, he eternally guards the eight directions.
May fragrant offerings endure forever, through countless springs.

When the Heavenly Worthy finished this gatha,
only then did the dragon chariot and crane carriage appear,
bearing him back to the azure heavens.
The ten thousand sages and thousand perfected each returned within the clouds.
The City God, august saint, bowed his head in farewell,
leaving this true scripture to be transmitted below to the world, circulated and recited.
Should one follow its teachings, boundless blessings shall be received.
All spirits rejoiced, faithfully accepting and upholding it.

Thus concludes *The Wondrous Scripture of the City God’s Response: Dispelling Disasters and Gathering Blessings*, spoken by the Most High Lord Lao.

*The True Declaration of the Metropolitan City God*

Ancestral spirits of the altars and fields, the rightful gods of all under Heaven,
they assess the loyal deeds of states and manifest the benevolence of rewarding good and punishing evil.
Lords of the capital, attendants of all prefectures,
they oversee the thirteen provincial administrations and adjudicate the eighteen bureaus.
Their temple altars endure for ten thousand years, their grace sustains for countless kalpas,
wielding the authority to bestow blessings or inflict awe,
holding the power to inscribe life and death.
Through divine might, they shield the royal domain;
with yin soldiers, they repel barbarian raiders.
Most numinous, most sagely, upright and impartial—
the Protector King, Guardian of Peace, August Spirit of Response, the Venerable Divine Lord.
