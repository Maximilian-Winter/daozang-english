# 玉皇心印妙经注

**Commentary on the *Wondrous Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Heart-Seal***

This is the transmission of the Jade Emperor’s heart-mind, passed down from sage to sage, sealing mind with mind. Through illumination and realization, all adhere to this principle. The Three Teachings do not transgress it—hence, it is called the *Heart-Seal*.

**The Three Grades of Supreme Medicine**
The most exalted wondrous medicine has three grades—namely, the three kinds:
**Spirit, qi, and essence.**
These are not minerals, alchemical arts, lingzhi mushrooms, or jade dust, nor are they external or common medicines. They are the primordial spirit, primordial qi, and primordial essence. Ordinary medicines may cure illness, but their reach is limited. This medicine preserves kalpas, delivers the world, and transforms boundless salvation—nothing compares to it, thus it is called *supreme medicine*.

**Vague and indistinct,**
seemingly existent yet not existent.
**Dim and obscure,**
seemingly absent yet not absent.
**Fathomless and distant,**
seemingly far yet not far.
**Dark and profound,**
seemingly near yet not near—
as if unseen and unheard, yet seemingly seen and heard.

**Preserve the nonexistent, guard the existent.**
Secretly abide in emptiness, silently uphold wondrous being.
**In an instant, it is accomplished.**
Once the supreme medicine is attained, one instantly ascends to the realm of sages.

**Revolving wind blends in harmony—**
the cyclical wind of Xun merges with the hundred spirits.
**A hundred days, and the work is efficacious.**
In three months, the foundation is laid; the work gradually becomes mystically potent.
**Silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor—**
the cosmos is tranquil and steadfast; secretly venerate the Primordial Sovereign.
**In one cycle, one ascends in flight.**
Twelve years, and the cinnabar spirit takes flight. Another saying: one sheds the twelve links of conditioned existence before ascending.

**Those who know awaken easily—**
those with true knowledge readily grasp the foundation of the supreme medicine.
**The ignorant struggle to practice.**
The foolish find it difficult to uphold the principle of preservation and abiding.

**Treading the radiance of heaven—**
when the cosmos is settled, the radiance of heaven emerges, and one’s feet tread the root of heaven.
**Inhaling and exhaling nurtures purity—**
true qi flows and reflows, nourishing the mysterious and pure.
**Emerging from the mysterious, entering the feminine—**
knowing the celestial valley’s primordial spirit, one emerges from the mysterious and enters the feminine.
**As if vanished, as if present—**
neither scattered nor forcibly retained—
as if vanished, as if present.

**Continuous and unbroken—**
silently, ceaselessly, from beginning to end.
**Firmly rooted, deeply grounded—**
the root of nature and the stem of life are wondrously cultivated and deeply secured.

**Each person possesses essence—**
every person has the most true and authentic essence.
**Essence unites with spirit—**
true essence wondrously merges with primordial spirit.
**Spirit unites with qi—**
primordial spirit wondrously merges with true qi.
**Qi unites with the true body—**
primordial qi wondrously merges with one’s utmost true body.

**If one does not attain this truth,**
one does not attain the utmost truth of the body.

All are forced designations.
To claim one has obtained the elixir is but a forced designation.
**Spirit can enter stone—**
spirit enters metal and stone without obstruction.
(Another version: "To penetrate mountains and pass through stone without fail.")
**Spirit can make the body fly—**
refining spirit to return to emptiness, the body naturally ascends.
**Entering water without drowning—**
one with the Dao is not swept away by water.
(Another version: "Unstained by desires is not to drown.")
**Entering fire without burning—**
one with the Dao cannot be consumed by fire.
(Another version: "Free from anger and delusion is not to burn.")

**Spirit depends on the body’s formation—**
the body takes form, and spirit arrives; thus, spirit depends on the body’s formation.
**Essence depends on qi’s fullness—**
when qi is replete, essence is complete; thus, essence depends on qi’s fullness.
**Neither withering nor decaying—**
when spirit, qi, and essence are whole, bound without dissipation, they neither wither nor decay.
**Like the verdant pine and cypress—**
ever unchanging, like the pine and cypress, evergreen.

**The three grades share one principle—**
the three grades of supreme elixirs share a single root and principle.
**Too wondrous to be heard—**
the profound mystery of the Double Mystery cannot be grasped by hearing.
**When gathered, it exists—**
through diligent preservation and silent guarding, the wondrous gathering brings it into being.
**When scattered, it dissipates—**
when the wondrous intent scatters, it swiftly withers and fades.

**The seven apertures are interconnected—**
the true seven apertures—ears, eyes, nose, and mouth—are internally linked.
(Another version: "The seven apertures reside within.")
**Each aperture radiates light—**
wind and clouds issue forth, and each aperture shines with light.
(Another version: "Each possesses the celestial light of treasured brilliance.")
**The sacred sun and sacred moon—**
the body’s true yin and true yang, eternally luminous and indestructible; thus, the sacred sun and sacred moon.
**Illuminating the Golden Court—**
light shines upon the cinnabar terrace and purple palace, said to illuminate the Golden Court.

**Once attained, forever attained—**
true attainment of real benefit is never lost or destroyed.

The body naturally becomes light.
Lightness of body means returning yang, transmuting bones, and reverting to emptiness—this is not merely physical health.
Great harmony overflows,
the true qi of great harmony fills and brims over.
The bones scatter like cold jade.
Within the yellow center, the principle is penetrated; the bones stand tall, the spirit rejoices, jade and gems fall away, leaving golden sinews and jade bones.
Attaining the elixir grants numinosity,
when the luminous medicine obtains the elixir, the mortal becomes numinous.
Failing to attain it leads to ruin.
Without the true elixir, the beam collapses and the body topples.
The elixir resides within the body, neither white nor blue—
not the white of the lungs, nor the blue of the liver.
Recite it ten thousand times,
silently revolve the true scripture ten thousand times, not merely reciting with the mouth.
The wondrous principle becomes self-evident.
The scripture’s wondrous principle suddenly becomes clear.

*Commentary on the Wondrous Scripture of the Heart Seal of the Supreme Jade Emperor* concludes.

**Text of Reverent Dedication and Repentance**

Turning the heart toward the Dao, earnestly repenting past transgressions, and reforming to avoid future faults.
The dragon’s script and phoenix’s seal have already exhausted the sincerity of song and praise;
the crane’s carriage and simurgh’s chariot earnestly hope for the grace of observation and reflection.
Your servant reverently burns true incense—cinnabar sincerity, celestial fragrance—
and earnestly petitions the Treasures of Dao, Scriptures, and Masters, the Primordial Beginning and the Myriad Spirits, all the sagely perfected of the Jade Radiance Assembly.
Humbly beseeching the gracious light, earnestly imploring witness and verification.

Your servant, in the past, on behalf of so-and-so for such-and-such a matter, has recited several copies of the *Collected Scriptures on the Original Conduct of the Jade Emperor*, respectfully safeguarding so-and-so in such-and-such a matter, and so forth, proclaiming the myriad scriptures—daring not be anything but reverent.
Yet, hindered by karmic obstructions and demonic obstacles, the spirit and mind became disordered; the established roots were dull. Naturally, thoughts arose in confusion, omissions and mix-ups occurred, repetitions and inversions arose, and while composing the text, personal bias led to character errors and sentence misplacements.
Deviating from the correct sounds of purity and turbidity, sinking into the perverse views of misinterpretation.
Affairs distracted the will, the heart was not in the scriptures.
Inquiries about well-being were cut off and estranged.
Long recitations grew lax, anger arose due to circumstances.
Solemn purity was sometimes tainted by dust and filth; reverence was sometimes marred by irreverence and negligence.
The body, mouth, and use of objects were impure; attire, crowns, rites, and manners were irreverent.
Offerings did not conform to the rites; the place was unsuitable; scrolls were crumpled and disordered, falling and becoming damaged.
Lacking focus and reverence, great shame and remorse arise.
Prostrate, I pray for compassion and mercy, forgiveness of transgressions, that recitation and upholding may reach the threshold of resonance.
May all prayers and wishes be as the heart desires.
Yet, I fear that transmission of the scripture may have been erroneous, and transcription may contain many mistakes.
The masters and recipients alike all repent.
By the power of the Dao, may sins be eradicated, may the Dharma wheel turn constantly, and may all beings be universally delivered.

For the sake of all the above, I bow my head and invoke the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Most Real Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures, the True Writings and Treasured Talismans, the Three Supreme Ones of the Great Dao, the Sagely Hosts of the Ten Directions, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,
and the innumerable hosts of immortals within the Jade Scripture, whose merits are inconceivable.
