**The True Precious Repentance Ritual to the Star of the Central Heavenly Purple Tenuity**

We prostrate ourselves before the great virtue of Heaven and Earth, which broadly sustains and nurtures all living beings; before the radiant light of the Sun and Moon, which universally illumines the ten thousand phenomena. In all earnest supplication, we humbly beseech your divine observation.

Your servant now kindles true incense, offering sincere devotion and reverent invocation, making offerings to the Supreme Void Sovereign of the Three Realms of the Great Dao, the Star Lord of the Central Heaven—the August Emperor of the Northern Culmen and Purple Tenuity; the Celestial King of the Zhou Dynasty of the Dragon Han Primordial Kalpa, Father of the Dipper; the Great Sage Mahādevī, Mother of the Dipper; the August Star Lord of the Most High Jade Emperor; the Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen and Mysterious Minister; the Imperial Lord of the Sun Palace; the Star Lord of the Moon Mansion; the Star Lords of the Five Directions and Five Virtues; the Star Lords of the Four Qi and Four Luminaries; the Great Sage Star Lord of the Celestial Stem; the Star Lords of the Three Terraces and Canopy; the Star Lords of the Twenty-Eight Constellations; the Star Lords of the Twelve Palaces and Celestial Branches; the Star Lord of one’s natal destiny; the Three Elder Star Lords of Supreme Clarity—Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity; the Star Lords presiding over the year’s fate and karmic influences; the Star Lords within and beyond the Three Enclosures; the Star Lords of the revolving heavens, the Milky Way, and all celestial luminaries; and the myriad perfected sages of the Three Realms and Ten Directions.

We reverently implore your vast compassion to witness this act of repentance.

We have heard: The Supreme Ultimate gave birth to the Two Modes, from which celestial images descended, silently governing the transformations of the cosmos. The lofty firmament arrayed the constellations to radiate brilliance, dividing their splendor across the earth. The heavens revolve through three hundred sixty-five and a quarter degrees, with subtle calculations numbering seventeen thousand five hundred and twenty hidden names. Their movements—whether slow or swift, direct or retrograde—follow the celestial paths, circling through the divisions of the earth.

We reverently consider the Star Lord, the August Emperor of Purple Tenuity: his jade steps are majestic, his jasper heavens lofty and remote. He presides over creation, holding the pivot of cosmic mechanisms. Seated in authority, he governs the Three Heavens; in his rule, he directs the movements of the Nine Paths. The Seven Governors and Four Qi issue their decrees through spring, summer, autumn, and winter; the Five Dippers and host of stars guard the directions and trigrams of Qian, Kun, Li, and Kan. The natal star of one’s destiny shines brightly; the Three Elders of Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity radiate luminosity. The Celestial Stem encircles the firmament; the lunar lodges and luminaries illumine the earth. Though silent, their responses are unfailing—where there is resonance, there is communication. Heaven is impartial, yet ever aids those of virtue; the lives of humans are endowed by the firmament above.

We, your servants, take refuge and reverently perform this precious repentance, bowing our heads to the august numen, gazing toward the Dipper’s pole with devoted hearts.

Today, we offer this on behalf of [Name], from the beginningless past to the present life. Driven by a single deluded thought, the six senses have become entangled; indulging in the three karmic actions without awareness, the ten evils have accumulated. Without repentance and confession, how could we presume upon your grace and forgiveness? Thus, we present these articles in reverent submission, taking refuge and paying homage. We gaze upward to the Purple Tenuity, the sagely pivot of the celestial sphere, and to the host of perfected beings. May blessings be universally bestowed, and compassionate light descend to universally illumine. May the three karmic actions be purified, the six senses cleansed, the five fortunes flourish abundantly, and a thousand auspicious signs converge in harmony.

We, your servants, look to heaven and long for the sagely presence, our hearts filled with earnest devotion. With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence.

We, the assembly of disciples, wholeheartedly submit our bodies, surrender our spirits, and yield our lives to the august and transcendent sagely Star Lords of the arrayed constellations, the native constellation of destiny, and the true lords who illuminate our lives.

We humbly beseech your great compassion to bestow vast blessings and universally descend your boundless grace.
We have heard that the radiant arrayed sages pay homage to the North Pole’s majesty;
The resplendent Seven Stars silently govern the transformations of the central heavens.
They respond to all prayers, refusing none.

Today, we repent for so-and-so, from the beginningless past to the present life.
Whether through body, speech, or mind, we have acted in discord, amassing the three karmic deeds.
Whether through greed, wrath, or delusion, we have indulged the six emotions.
We have committed killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, and lewd speech, falsehoods.
We have exposed ourselves beneath the Three Luminaries;
We have offended the assembled sages.
We have harmed sentient beings, discarded the Five Grains,
Accumulated the ten heavy obstructions, deepened the three poisonous karmas,
Acted willfully without shame or remorse.
Whether through seeing or hearing, we have acted on our own;
Whether through thoughts or intentions, we have instructed others.
For these manifold roots of sin, we repent each one.

We pray that the true stars, perceiving through the Dipper’s pole,
May extend their compassionate primordial net,
Pouring forth the boundless rain of grace,
The vast and overflowing blessings.
Pity our ignorance, forgive our transgressions.
Turn the revolving limits toward peace,
Align the stars with their proper paths.
Through the power of this repentance,
We rely upon and receive your mysterious merit,
Bestowing upon all beings the return to the true Dao.

With single-minded devotion, we bow our heads and give thanks to the supreme, most true Three Treasures.
We have heard that the azure heavens, in their unitary motion, manifest the myriad luminaries;
The most mysterious Dao bestows the Five Fortunes to benefit all beings.
We have now completed the reverent offering of this precious repentance.

We pray that the myriad heavens may perceive and widely bestow their universal grace;
That the arrayed luminaries may descend in their lofty presence, granting great merciful blessings.
May the thousand transgressions and ten thousand errors all be swept away;
May the three karmic deeds and six senses all receive forgiveness.
May fortune enrich the ten thousand beings,
May grace extend to the ten directions.
We bow our heads and take refuge in the boundless Great Dao.

With wholehearted devotion, we invoke the name of the Heavenly Worthy who eliminates transgressions and eradicates sins.
The Precious Repentance to the True Star of the Central Purple Tenuity is now complete.
