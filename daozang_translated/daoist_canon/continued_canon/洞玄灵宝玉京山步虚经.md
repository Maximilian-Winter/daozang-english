### *Dongxuan Lingbao Yujing Shan BuXu Jing*

The Mystic Capital’s Jade Capital Mountain lies above the Three Clarities, beyond form and dust. At its summit stands the Jade Capital’s Golden Towers, the Seven Treasures’ Mystic Terrace, and the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, wherein reside the Three Treasure Spirit Scriptures. On the mountain’s eight directions, seven-jeweled trees grow naturally—one tree per direction, eight trees filling the eight quarters, their canopies covering all heavens, encompassing the Three Realms, serving as the governance of the Most High, the Boundless, the Void Sovereign Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Great Luo Heaven.

The mountain’s forests and palaces all bear the registers of the heavenly sages. The heavenly sage emperors, kings, and innumerable hosts of lofty immortals and perfected beings assemble thrice monthly upon it. They burn naturally fragrant aloeswood that regenerates, and flying immortals scatter blossoms, encircling the Seven Treasures’ Mystic Terrace thrice. They chant and intone the empty and cavernous hymns. At this time, the heavens resound with music—hundreds of thousands of celestial musicians—cloud chimes ringing clear. True consorts sing in unison, their voices resonant, while immortal youths stand solemnly, their pure songs rising. Jade maidens advance gracefully, their steps light, their flowing dances elegant, their forms radiant and graceful.

Upon the mountain, the seven-jeweled flower groves glow with brilliant hues, their crimson fruits resplendent, all fashioned from gold, silver, pearls, jade, crystal, lapis lazuli, *□qí*, and agate. When the numinous wind stirs them, their sounds naturally form the pentatonic scale, refined and wondrous beyond compare. The heavens’ hosts, hearing the melody, soar aloft, ceaselessly plucking strings and singing, sighing in rapture at the supreme sound, unable to describe it. Divine beasts—dragons, unicorns, lions, white cranes, rare birds, and phoenixes—wail and leap in joy.

The Most High resounds the Dharma drum, extending invitations to the jade hall. Seated upon lotus blossoms, he expounds the Dao in tranquil perfection, chanting the cavernous scriptures, elucidating the mysterious texts. Distantly savoring the subtle and formless, his joy stirs the assembly of immortals. At that moment, the eight winds unfurl banners, incense and blossoms scatter and mingle, and fragrant mist swirls in abundance.

The Most High declares: *"Excellent! The formless is called the Dao; its meaning is profoundly mysterious. The wondrous enlightenment spans vast kalpas, enduring through countless ages. The Dao’s essence, though obscure in speech, is entrusted to these two chapters. If disciples can fast for long durations, ponder deeply, recite the cavernous scriptures, knock their teeth, swallow saliva, exhale and inhale the Great Harmony, their bodies will assume the hue of golden blossoms, their necks bear circular radiance, their heads adorned with the sun’s brilliance, the moon’s essence, and the dark mystery. In their hands, they grasp the spirit talismans and the ten-knotted banners. Such virtue is majestic—the Dao’s utmost honor. Cherish this mysterious transformation, and you shall become the Most High’s perfected ones. By moving the Boundless, you will stir the Heavenly Elder, summon flying dragons, and descend celestial immortals."*

Through the Three Realms and Nine Lands, at the cycle’s end of the great kalpa, during the catastrophes of the Yang’s nine and six, and the disasters of water and fire, all shall be dissolved and transformed by the Supreme Dao of Jade Clarity. The Three Caverns’ true scriptures, the divine and perfected treasure texts, the golden writings and jade characters, the phoenix-seal and dragon-bound scrolls—all shall return to the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, to the Seven Treasures’ Mystic Terrace within Jade Capital, untouched by calamity. When the kalpa renews and the primordial chaos is once more divided, the transmission of the true sages shall descend to transform the human realm.

This mountain resides in the highest heaven of the five hundred fifty-five thousand five hundred fifty-fifth layered heaven, beyond the sun and moon’s realm of the Eight Brahma Heavens, ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine *qi* away—a single black *qi* spanning three thousand miles.

The heavenly immortals name this mountain in ten ways:
1. The Heaven-Covering Summit Mountain,
2. The Boundless Mystery Upper Mountain,
3. The Net of Mystery Cavernous Void Mountain,
4. The Lofty Supreme True Origin Mountain,
5. The Multitude of Treasures’ Hidden Kalpa Blade Mountain,
6. The Formless Great Treasure Mountain,
7. The All-Encompassing Cavernous Mystery Mountain,
8. The Radiant Flower Supreme Perfection Mountain,
9. The Inconceivable Mountain,
10. The Supreme Mystic Capital Jade Capital Great Mountain.

To know these mountain names is to have one’s name entered among the immortals.

Upon the mountain, the seven-jeweled flower groves all bear the writings of the Supreme Clarity’s Three Caverns’ scriptures on Dao and virtue. Those who consume these blossoms and fruits become golden radiance immortals. Disciples who recite this scripture, savoring its utmost truth, shall naturally attain the Dao.

### *Treading the Void Chant*

When performing the *Lingbao Dongxuan* fast and reciting the *Empty Cavern’s Treading the Void Verses*, first knock the teeth thrice and swallow saliva thrice. Visualize the sun and moon before your face, their radiance pouring into your nose—the sun entering from the left, the moon from the right—entering the Golden Flower Palace. A luminous glow emerges behind your head, forming a nine-colored circular aura, suffusing the Jade Pillow and illuminating the ten directions. Follow this as you circumambulate the scriptures. Upon completion, knock the teeth thrice again and swallow saliva thrice. Envision the Three Primordial Sovereign Ladies within the Golden Flower Palace, appearing like infant siblings.

Perfected ones observing the fast adhere to the rites of dignity, omitting only the invocation of officials and the dispatch of spirit soldiers. All other prayers, vows, and prostrations follow the grand fast’s established rites. On the first day, spirit soldiers are dispatched, except when transmitting scriptural methods or instructing outsiders—then, no spirit soldiers need be sent.

The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One treasures this scripture. Those without immortal names in their destiny must not be allowed to see it.

The Mud Pill Palace shines with luminous splendor,

Guiding the reins to the ten directions,
I rest upon the mystic radiance’s slopes.
Gazing up at the Kalpa Terrace,
looking down upon the Purple Cloud Net.
Carefree in the Most High’s capital,
together we sit upon lotus blossoms.

6.

The soaring trees of the Mystic Radiance Garden,

Three hundred named celestial beasts,
lions vast as ten thousand fathoms.
Flying dragons pace and roar,
divine phoenixes chant in rhythm.
A numinous breeze fans wondrous blossoms,
pure fragrance scatters upon my lapels.
Without transcendent talent,
how could I indulge this heart?
I harness my Nine Dragon Carriage,
riding the void in carefree ease.
The Eight Heavens like my palm,
the Six Harmonies—how could they be distant?

The host of immortals recites the Cavernous Scripture,
the Most High sings a pure hymn.
Fragrant blossoms scatter with the wind,
jade tones form in the Purple Empyrean.
The Five Sufferings burst forth at once,

misty, crowning the radiant spirits.
Flowing brilliance, the Dharma wheel’s net,
spinning through emptiness into formlessness.
The Void Sovereign plucks the cloud zither,
the host of Perfected recites the Cavernous Scripture.
Exalted immortals bow in praise,
through endless kalpas, preserving purity.
The Utmost Perfected awaits nothing,
sometimes guiding the flying dragons.
Long fasts convene in the Mystic Capital,
jade chimes strike the jasper bells.
The Ten Flowers’ immortals gather,
purple mist coalesces into a palace.
Canopies array before the Most High,
Perfected Ones hold the lotus.
Scattering blossoms, I declare my vow,
grasping the tally to subdue the Demon King.

numinous chants harmonize as one.
Neither this nor that—
thoughts commune with the subtle and profound.

**Eight Hymns in Praise of the Most High’s Wisdom Scripture**

1.
The Most High’s Mystic Void School,
honors its scripture as the Dao’s vastness.
Gazing up and down, I have attained immortality,
through countless kalpas, unaging.
Majestic, the Great Perfected’s virtue,
tranquil, rooted in non-arising.
Celestial radiance weaves empty structures,
riding the void, naturally journeying.
Sun and moon blaze with brilliance,
peace and harmony, joy unending.
To study immortality, sever ornate thoughts,
each thought accumulates in succession.
Coming and going disturb my spirit,
restless, it knows no respite.
Extinguish thoughts, still the empty leisure,
whispering, entering emptiness and silence.

2.
Seeking the scriptures as if starving or thirsting,
holding resolve firm as metal and stone.
Preserve the path to your flying immortality,
the Five Numinous tally your register.
Crossing the Six Perfections’ conduct,
thus I untie the Three Nets.
Purifying fasts honor the Primal Simplicity,
exhaling and inhaling, nurturing cloud sprouts.
Carefree within the Golden Gate,
the Jade Capital becomes my home.
Naturally, the Seven Treasures arise,
each person sits upon a lotus.
Gazing up, I chew the Mystic Capital’s dates,
looking down, I savor the Cavernous Void’s melons.
My countenance shines like ten suns,
why reckon the kalpas’ multitude?
Dharma drums summon the celestial immortals,
jade chimes subdue the great demons.
A numinous breeze fans fragrant blossoms,
resplendent, unfurling my lapels.
The Utmost Perfected plucks the cloud zither,
the host of immortals strums the numinous harp.
Elegant songs of the Three Heavens’ radiance,
scattering wisdom in the Jade Flower Grove.
Seven ancestors ascend to the Blessing Hall,
thus treading the mystic tones.
If past lives’ blessings were insufficient,
this book would be distant and hard to find.
Faith in the Dao knows no end,
seeking flight, one sinks instead.

3.
The Most High’s non-action Dao,
its vastness lies in the people’s hearts.
Studying the Dao begins with cinnabar faith,
serving the master as if kin.
Drawing radiance to match the pure void,
diligently renewing with each day.
Until all people attain liberation,
I will not liberate myself.
Great vows demand profound repayment,
mystic virtue must be true.
Yin’s evil sins run deep,
confronting them like a turning wheel.
Studying the Dao is also arduous,
day and night, building the field of blessings.
Planting virtue is like planting trees,
piling baskets to form a mountain.
If you can indulge in the mystic and exalted,
you will soar into the azure heavens.
Cultivating this non-action Dao,
you will bind good fortune’s threads.

4.
The Most High’s most recondite book,
named the *Scripture of Wisdom*.
Deliverance from suffering requires great talent,
transcending the mundane to attain the Perfected.
A numinous countenance, rare in the world,
resplendent as a lotus in the abyss.
Human conduct, if it has roots,
all stems from past lives’ merit.
Establishing virtue must be timely,
vows, once made, are never unfulfilled.
Good and evil both await their recompense,
the principle of rise and fall is unfathomable.
The worthy uphold the Dharma’s words,
the Dao also lies in forgetting both.
Understanding this is great wisdom,
ascending to become a Supreme Pole Lord.
Jewel canopies link jade carriages,
commanding the Nine Dragons’ reins.
Golden Flowers herald the Cavernous Scripture,
immortal youths all hold incense.
Whistling and singing through the Mystic Capital,
jade chimes strike the jasper bells.
Refining the body to ascend the Great Clarity,
surpassing radiance, soaring through the Purple Empyrean.
Upholding the Dharma’s net,
roaming the mystic ultimate in carefree ease.
Ten thousand kalpas are like last night,
a thousand cedars like this morning.

Majestic peaks shade the radiant clouds,
hands grasp the jeweled branches of the sacred grove.
Fragrant mist drifts away of itself,
mystic melodies harmonize with the whirlwind.
Spiritual banners unfurl with the wind,
fleeting thoughts dissolve in due time.
Extinguishing wisdom, vast is the Great Undifferentiated,
non-action becomes the pure chant.

These are the words of the Supreme Pole Perfected,
ever cherished and recited by the host of immortals—
never to be revealed to the vulgar below,
but secretly preserved within golden palaces and jade chambers.

The Immortal Lord declared:
"These should be transmitted only to those who cultivate the Numinous Treasure Retreat,
never shown to the frivolous and ostentatious.
Beware! Beware!"

The Mystic Master, Supreme Primordial Perfected,
bestowed upon Attendant Xu the *Jade Capital Mountain Formulae of the Great Cavern Numinous Treasure Scripture*,
composing three odes in response.
That same evening, the Lady of Right Florescence also chanted them.

**Ode:**
The Eight Assemblies’ paths have no origin,
riding the current, one beholds the clamor of the world.
Transforming and dissolving the floating dust,
unfastening the lapel, one finds the Daoist household.
In an instant, mist vanishes,
bearing truth, one ascends to the Numinous Alas.
The empty scene gazes upon the jasper pavilion,
the Mystic Harmony sings the Phoenix Song.
The path is free from hindrance,
divine sounds dance upon the clouds.
Equal in virtue to the Jade Capital,
why trouble with worldly concerns?

Left hand grasping the Jade Flower Canopy,
soaring at dawn, treading the Seven Primes.
The Three Luminaries gleam with purple radiance,
upright and poised, one attends the Radiant Perfected.
In a moment, leaping transformations occur,
all four directions become divine.
The numinous scripture knows no bounds,
diligently ponder the *Shangqing* texts.
Why linger on the crossroads,
causing your devotion to waver?

Yin ailments lose their mystic mechanism,
unaware, the years divide.
Mystic waves stir the azure tides,
vast ford rouses the myriad streams.
Riding the light, one gazes upon the Six Voids,
longing to wander with the Perfected.
Exquisite songs find no response,
pure tones have no one to receive them.
Amid the clouds, jasper wheels race—
who among them is a companion of dust?

The Supreme Lord of the Supreme Pole and Five Perfected,
on Mount Yu in the Yu Mountains,
bestowed the *Cavernous Numinous Treasure Scripture* upon Lord Immortal Ge,
each reciting an ode.

**Ode of the Supreme Lord of the Supreme Pole:**
The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao,
revealed the *Numinous Treasure Chapters*.
Lofty and wondrous, beyond compare,
like the profound within the profound.
The ten directions’ lands,
all revere the Supreme Immortals.
Vast is the *Cavernous Void Scripture*,
serene in repose, one summons the heavens.
Above, it treasures the Purple Tenuity Terrace,
below, it conceals the myriad famous mountains.
Resplendent with dragon and phoenix script,
its brilliance dwells therein.
Wondrous is the Supreme Dao,
non-action is ever natural.
Kings, lords, and common folk—
what they value is only worthiness.
Those with karmic fortune,
stand out from past affinities.
Dharma masters transmit it in turn,
treasured faith spans kalpas.
With a broad mind, deliver all,
great fortune repays your person.
Those who make offerings will attain the Dao,
those who uphold it become Perfected.
The Great Dao has no self or other,
transmission must reach the Perfected.

**Ode of the Supreme Primordial First Perfected:**
Myriad wonders emerge from the Cavernous Perfected,
resplendent, illuminating the Great Clarity.
Those who uphold it are called immortals,
embodying the origin, they attain eternal life.
Carefree, they sport in the Mystic Void,
palaces array their forms.
Lush and lustrous, the Seven Treasures Grove,
radiant as the sun and moon’s essence.
Dragons and unicorns gallop in crisscross,
phoenixes soar with mournful cries.
The Supreme Lord governs the Purple Terrace,
the host of Perfected recite the Cavernous Scripture.
Holding incense, they bow in reverence,
circumambulating the palace city.
After three circuits, returning to the high seat,
the Dao King responds in kind.
When the lord of men upholds the Supreme Dao,
the world enjoys universal peace.

**Ode of the Supreme Primordial Second Perfected:**
Emptiness and nothingness are ever natural,
forcedly named the Great Dao.
Its sound transcends boundless limits,
myriad wonders return to the Numinous Treasure.
Closing the eyes, one visualizes the Supreme Perfected,
with concentrated thought, the Ten Elders descend.
Ascending as immortals, forever non-active,
their numinous countenances ever wondrous.
Thirst quenched by the Jade Pool’s nectar,
hunger sated by the Golden Flower Herb.
Purifying the world, delivering from the Eight Difficulties,
relieving the world’s myriad sufferings.

**Ode of the Supreme Primordial Third Perfected:**
Wondrous is the *Numinous Treasure Scripture*,
the Supreme Lord’s natural writing.
Those who uphold it attain the Dao,
called to descend as Perfected in the world.
Entrusted to propagate the Daoist teachings,
truly surpassing worldly talent.
When the task is complete, one ascends as an immortal,
palaces govern the Mystic Terrace.
At times descending Mount Kunlun,
carefree, one rests in Penglai.

**Ode of the Perfected of the Correct One, the Supreme Three Heavens Dharma Master, Celestial Master Zhang:**
The *Numinous Treasure* and *Great Cavern*,
the supreme Perfected Dao Scripture King.
Only the Five Thousand Characters,
lofty and wondrous, without equal.
Those who uphold it ascend as flying immortals,
dwelling in the void, governing the emptiness.
Attending the Supreme Lord’s Terrace,
carefree in the Purple Tenuity Palace.
Ten thousand kalpas are like a flash of lightning,
eternally abiding, never ending.
The Daoist robes are fully prepared,
spontaneously penetrating the obscure.
Unknowing of the dark and dim,
serene in repose, one beholds the ten directions.

**Three Odes of Reverence and Incantation**
The Perfected said: "The formula states that when the scripture-attending immortal youths and jade maidens hear this incantation, they all rejoice and protect the practitioner’s person.
All great scriptures employ this incantation in worship.
Those who sincerely revere the scriptures also silently recite its words—
this is the secret of the Supreme Immortals."

Delighting in the Dharma as one’s spouse,
cherishing the scriptures like pearls and jade.
Upholding precepts to restrain the seven emotions,
contemplating the Dao to dispel desires.
With simplicity, the upright qi abides,
tranquil, the spirit is serene.
Heavenly demons all yield in respect,
lifetimes enjoy great fortune.
Lush and prosperous, the household and state,
flourishing, the Dao and scriptures thrive.
Heaven and humanity share the same aspiration,
soaring into the Great Vehicle.
Establishing a field of merit in the heart,
the Dharma wheel ascends without cease.
Seven ancestors ascend to the heavenly halls,
one’s person ascends at daylight.
The Great Dao pervades the Cavernous Void,
with mindfulness, nothing fails to align.
Refining the body to enter the immortal Perfected,
one thus achieves the Vajra Body.
Surpassing the Three Realms’ difficulties,
the Five Sufferings of hell are resolved.
All return to the Supreme Lord’s scriptures,
serene in contemplation, bowing in reverence.

Lord Immortal Ge of the Supreme Pole’s Left, named Xuan, styled Xiaoxian,
on Mount Tiantai, bestowed the teachings upon his disciples Zheng Siyuan, the śramaṇa Zhu Falan, Shi Daowei, and Sun Quan of the Wu dynasty.
Later, Siyuan, in the Horse’s Hoof Mountains, transmitted them to Ge Hong.
Hong was the grandnephew of Lord Immortal Ge, known as the Master Who Embraces Simplicity, authoring inner and outer canonical works.
At that time, Master Zheng spoke of the immortal teacher, Lord Immortal Ge, saying:
"The *Supreme Clarity Three Caverns Great Perfected Dao Scripture* I have transmitted—
on the day of my departure, one copy shall be entrusted to the famous mountains and terraces of Wu,
one copy to my disciples,
and one copy to my family’s descendants,
to be recorded and transmitted through the generations."

The Perfected One, if merely devoted to these scriptures while pursuing worldly affairs, shall be unworthy of their transmission and recording. They may then be wholly entrusted to the renowned mountains and Five Peaks, and must not be lightly transmitted to those unfit. Should one prove worthy, they ought to be passed on—lest the celestial Dao be obstructed.

The *Scripture of Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure, and Strolling the Void on Jade Capital Mountain* concludes.

[1] "Five" should read "three."
[2] "Above" was mistakenly written as "mountain."
