**Chapter on Joy and Sorrow of the High Above Jade Emperor**

**1. The Daoist Realm’s Harmony**
Fetter my innate *qi* naturally,
Condense and refine the City of the Purple Phoenix.

Ascend the lofty Nine Peaks,
Soar the towering flying jade.

Descend upon the layered void,
Twist and turn through the Eight Pure Realms.

The Purple Canopy radiates the Cloud Palace,
Its luminous glow veiling the Five Spirits.

**2. Cosmic Cycles**
Fourfold paths extend to boundless wilderness,
Eight *qi* revolve in perfect clarity.

On wings of *yùnyáo* (扶摇), traversing the Great Void,
Seven Scenes shift along the Celestial Path.

When the movement comes, no form remains,
As time departs, transformation tilts.

Within the Nine Enclosures, *jùdù* (交度) intertwines,
Two Symbols contend in mutual sway.

The Emperor of the One stands firm in the Mid-Heaven,
Four Pillars never falter in their essence.

To the south, the flying treasures of the Sovereign,
To the north, the Hall of Broad Cold.

The Mystic Chamber hosts the True Assembly,
Voiceless songs arise from Nature’s birth.

**3. Celestial Sovereignty**
The Five Emperors command the Spirit Banner,
The Demon Banner subdues the myriad spirits.

The Demon howls from the void,
The Dao’s world knows no end to its joy.

Thus, the *Qūsù* verses arise,
Celebrating the gods in eternal peace.

How vast is our accord—
Ten thousand *jié* (劫) as one lifetime.

Revolving through the Nine Ten-Thousand *jié*,
Together we roam the Purple Phoenix Palanquin.

The Void spawns the Purple Phoenix Terrace,
Jade Gates align with the Great Constellation.

The Spirit Wind permeates the Eight Assemblies,
The Northern Window opens with *Chānghé* (阊阖).

**4. Mortal Lament**
Beneath, the Wandering Songsters,
Ever sing of the *yùnsàng* (运丧) sorrow.

At dawn, they ride the Scenes to wander,
At dusk, they cling to the Scenes and return.

Two Scenes merge as one,
Yet they fear losing the radiance of the Scenes.

The Nine *qi* do not dwell,
Heaven and Earth face perilous tilt.

When the Great *jié* ends in a single *chūn* (椿),
One hundred and sixty *jié* begin anew.

The Great Spring surges from the Nine Peaks,
The Great Crow soars through the hanging heavens.

Ten thousand *liè* (疠) drift in endless flow,
Gazing upon the mountains, they find no rest.

Their cries echo without cliffs,
Yet sorrow cannot but wound the heart.

**5. The Virtue of the Sage**
The worthy and the sainted diligently chant the *sūtra*,
Thus they attain to ride the Scenes and fly.

At that time, they come to greet me,
Together we gather at the Nine-Heaven Gates.

Counting the *jīnmǎ* (金马) cycles to completion,
Ten thousand *liè* (疠) cross in wild gallop.

No sight of the Awakened Immortal,
Only tears for the lifeless corpse.

Alas, this foolish mortal’s nature,
Clutching life in pain—how pitiful!

**6. Dissolving Sorrow, Embracing Joy**
Dispel my sorrow at the Nine Mystic Terraces,
Gather my joy in harmony with the Great Void.

Hand in hand with the Ten Heavenly Truths,
Laughing at fate as Ocean Child.

Fourfold paths merge with the Eight Assemblies’ *qi*,
Mystic currents stir the *Lángtái* (阆台) winds.

My vision brightens at the Western Hua Palace,
My intent aligns with the Broad Cold Hall.

Beneath the Purple Phoenix, the dance is lively,
Above the Nine Peaks, the air is crisp.

Endless radiance drifts through the boundless wild,
Gazing upward, I see the *jié* (劫) blade’s edge.

**7. Celestial Music**
Clear songs harmonize the Five Tones,
Joy and sorrow naturally follow.

Two inclinations blend in one accord,
Logic opposes yet returns as one.

Together we rejoice without end,
From beginning to end, we hold to joy.

Drinking deeply from the Jade Pool’s wine,
Gazing upward, I sip the Flying Hua’s nectar.

Spirit Melons feast from the River’s banquet,
Their flavor like sunlight and moonlight’s glow.

Seven Luminaries radiate their fragrant brilliance,
This joy—how could one forget?

**8. The Great *jié*’s Shift**
The Great *jié* has an ending cycle,
Its turn brings the Two Symbols’ tilt.

The Dragon Gate severs the Heavenly River,
Three Five return in mutual contest.

The Red Capital holds the Eastern Well,
The Hua Canopy covers the Morning Stars.

Darkness veils the Eight Desolations,
Foul *qi* obscures the Celestial Essence.

Three Officials hasten in their duties,
Five Sacred Peaks lose their steadfastness.

Ten thousand *liè* (疠) cross in wild gallop,
The Northern Emperor bravely leads the Demon Host.

Eight Pillars array the outer heavens,
Only the Holy Sovereign can clear the way.

**9. The Dao’s True Nature**
This is the fettering of innate *qi*,
Towering through the Ninefold Celestial City.

Gazing high, I pity the myriad beings,
Joy and sorrow arise from this.

Voiceless songs disperse the divine essence,
Mystic joy returns as tears.

**10. Mortal Folly**
How woeful are these stubborn folk,
Squandering wealth, lusting for fleeting glory.

Eagerly awaiting fate’s arrival,
They heed no calamity.

The wise and the sagely come contrary,
Morning and night, they chant the *sūtra* diligently.

Honoring the Void, they meditate on the Mystic,
To transcend the endless age.

If one seeks the Dao’s source,
Eightfold rhythms resound with Jade’s name.

**11. The Great *jié*’s Trial**
The *jié* of the Hare brings woe to the Nine Luminaries,
Let them witness the Great Peace.

The Jade Phoenix weaves at dawn,
The Purple Terrace glows in the Jade Forest.

Light drifts across the layered Mystic,
Lofty peaks rise o’er the Nine Shades.

Purple Scenes scatter the Vermilion Mist,
Flying smoke intertwines in search.

Seven Treasures shake the jade branches,
Spirit Beasts gallop the Cloud Peaks.

Ten thousand immortals ride the void in song,
Divine immortals raise wondrous melodies.

**12. The High Dawn Master**
Above, the High Dawn Master,
Bows in silence, his howls and chants arise.

Eight Assemblies naturally accord,
Voidly descending, all is jade and gold.

Jade-chewed nectar fills the *jié*’s dawn,
Jade essence scatters through my heart.

Bright Pearls chant the Spirit Song,
The Dao’s form harmonizes with the clear *qín*.

**13. The Dao’s Ultimate Truth**
The Jade Chapter is the Dao’s ultimate source,
Joy and sorrow dissolve for all.

Free me from the endless age,
This profound delight knows no bound.

The natural high immortals’ melody,
How could one dare to match its grandeur?

At dawn, I play in the Eastern Hua Palace,
At dusk, I wander the Western Hua Hall.

Taking joy in the Two Hua Palaces,
I never meet with those who seek delight.

Only the Wandering Songsters’ voices heard,
Their sorrowful cries wound the Heavenly Child.

**14. The Final Descent**
Mournful echoes drift through the Cold Hall,
I stroke my grief as the world’s fate runs out.

The Heavenly Horse leaps through the Nine Rivers,
The Crow Mother rides the Flying Dragon.

No bridge spans the Mystic Crossing,
Two *qi* are severed, communication lost.

Ascending my towering *Língtái* (崚嶒),
Gazing upon the Ninefold Difficulties.

Foul *qi* pervades the Three Spirits,
Ten thousand beings bear the calamity’s weight.

Eight Domains leave no survivors,
Great and small mountains crumble.

**15. The Unlearned**
Thinking thus, I know not to study,
Hearing the *sūtra*, I am deaf and dull.

Together they follow fate’s course,
Swiftly reaching their end.

How cruel is this disaster’s fate,
My grief for them pierces my chest.

The Purple Phoenix rides the void and ascends,
Towering through the Nine Mystic Shades.

When *qi* is fettered, its shadow appears,
When *qi* disperses, the spirit vanishes.

Drifting without end,
Heaven’s music suits my delight.

**16. The Dao’s Song**
In harmony with the Eight Assemblies’ song,
Equal to the high immortals’ company.

Hand in hand with the Ten Heavenly Truths,
Feasting on the Nine Phoenix Bodies.

Ascending the Jade Capital’s gates,
Descending to play in the *Lángfēng* (阆风) State.

Feathered steeds swiftly wheel the jade chariot,
Purple mist emptily supports them.

At the extreme dawn, awaiting the morning,
Together in joy without end.

The endless radiance follows fate’s shift,
A hundred million *chūn* (椿) begin anew.

**17. The Dao’s Embrace**
My joy is the natural essence,
Dispelling my worldly sorrow.

**The Dao’s Lament and the Celestial Gathering**

Who could join this game without the Primordial Spirit’s treasure?
Alas, within the hollow void, joy sparks anew into sorrow.

At dawn, I depart from the **Shùméng** Ridge,
By dusk, I gaze upon the **Xīlǒng** Mound.
No sight of the Nine Soul Mothers—
With the Northern Immortals, I wander the Dao’s path.

I question the Great Symbol’s passage,
As the Two *Qi* suddenly swirl about.
The Nine Dragons stir the **Dōngjǐng** Well,
The Heavenly Steed gallops from the western corner.

The Northern Sovereign unleashes celestial troops,
The Five Peaks align with the Mystic Seal.
Ten thousand demons are bound in ritual,
The Five Phases conspire in early accord.

War’s calamity spreads across the heavens,
A hundred myriads are ensnared.
Above and below, all gather in assembly,
Sweeping away what lacks foundation.

Alas, within the Five Trials’ grasp,
Fate’s wheel knows no kin or stranger.
Ascending to the Eight Assemblies’ Hall,
I bind my shadow-companions in the dark.

Surveying the utmost scholars,
Blessed lands uphold them in their quest.
Abandoning home to seek the Dao,
I attain the means to free your form.

With diligent heart, I refine the Sacred Text,
When the Dao is complete, the need [to act] must cease.

Leisurely upon the Phoenix Platform,
How could joy not fill the soul?

At the Great Assembly’s **Zhōngyuán**,
The **Zhōngyuán** Gathering Hall resounds.
Above, the Eight Assemblies’ *qi* swirls,
The Purple Phoenix dances in the void.

Golden rods cling to the jade roots,
Seven treasures weave the flower-bells.
Dragons soar beyond the utmost peaks,
Phoenix cries shake the ten thousand leagues.

No sight of departing guests,
Only the phoenix-clouds rise.
The palace notes harmonize themselves,
Sounds form naturally.

Mystic songs chant the wondrous tune,
Sorrow and joy intertwine as scripture.
I seek my own true essence—
Who knows the Immortal’s spirit?

Brocade clouds bear the night’s moon,
Purple radiance veils the flying jade.
Three dawns stir the Great Luminance,
Seven voids illuminate the Five Stars.

The Spirit Banners gleam with might,
Purple mists drift through the Azure Clarity.

I deem the Western Marvel exquisite,
Yet none compare to the Purple Phoenix City.

Above dwells the Unbinding Robe’s wearer,
One glance grants ten thousand years of joy.
Together in endless delight,
Awakening as heaven and earth tilt.

The Spirit’s course has its own end,
Fate’s measure frees the Mystic Void.
Coming and going follow the wheel’s turn—
Why cling to sorrow’s snare?

Dissipate sorrow beyond the Eight Desolations,
The Great Symbol does not cling to truth.

Leisurely in the Joyous Hall,
Who would count sorrow as kin?

The Five Trials are constant gatherings,
Yet those who grieve are self-made.

Though palace and zither may not harmonize,
The Great Return balances all things.

Thus, I compose the **Yōulè** chapters,
To cross the Awakened Dao’s body.

Through bitter practice, I refine the Spirit-Words,
Their wondrous meaning shines naturally bright.

Only girded with the **Qǔsù** chapters,
Can one enter the Sorrowless Ford.

Ascending the void to the Phoenix Platform,
Highly observing the **Chéngtáng** years.

What greater joy could there be?
Who would seek sorrow’s echo?

**The Highest Supreme Jade Dawn Phoenix Platform *Qǔsù* Chapter’s Supreme Joy and Sorrow**

The lofty **Yùchén** chapters of Joy and Sorrow,
Born empty upon the Phoenix Platform’s heights,
The Spirit-Words illuminate the Five Directions,
Golden sounds drift through the Ten Heavens.

The Nine Curves’ **Yùjīng** Highest Truths
All cast in gold tablets,
With purple brushes inscribing the text,
Their voices unite in chanting the Mystic Joy-Sorrow songs.

Their words are profound and recondite,
With wondrous depths unfathomable—
Only the highest companions could ever plumb their meaning.

Those with the **East Huá** golden name,
The **Fèngquè** jade script,
May alone behold this text.

Obtaining the **Fèngqì** Mystic Hill’s True Script,
The Magic Banner commanding demons—
Reciting the Joy-Sorrow chapters,
The Five Emperors’ guards stand true,
Heavenly demons pay reverence,
Protecting the ascent to the Highest Immortal,
Welcoming the Sacred Sovereign in the **Shàngqīng** Palace,
And wandering the Phoenix Platform’s hall.

All who receive this text
Must, on their birthdays, the **Tàisuì** years,
The Eight Nodes’ days,
And each month’s fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth,
After bathing and fasting in purity,
Face east and recite the **Qīngdì** chapters twice,
Then bow to the **Yùzhēn** of the morning,
Turn south and recite the **Chì** chapters twice,
Then bow to the **Yùzhēn** of the morning,
Turn west and recite the **Bái** chapters twice,
Then bow to the **Yùzhēn** of the morning,
Turn north and recite the **Hēi** chapters twice,
Then bow to the **Yùzhēn** of the morning,
Face the **Tàisuì** and recite the **Huángdì** chapters twice,
Then bow to the **Yùzhēn** of the morning.

After completing the Five Directions,
Turn north and kneel nine times,
Bowing to the **Yùchén** Sovereign,
Swallowing the *qi* nine times in succession.

Thus, the Five Imperial Banners are hung in the five directions of the hall.
