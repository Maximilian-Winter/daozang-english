**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Origin’s Transformations and Treasured True Essence**

The sacred scriptures of Supreme Clarity arose at the inception of the Nine Heavens, born of spontaneity and coexisting with qi. The Three Radiant Ones shone in unison, manifesting above the Nine Heavens and within the Great Void. At times, they coalesced into soaring dark-purple qi, forming numinous texts—celestial writings of ineffable subtlety, their strokes sinuous and intricate. Each character spanned a *zhang* in size, their details elusive; none but the Perfected Kings of the Nine Heavens could fathom their profound resonance.

In the first year of the *Shangxu* era, the Perfected Kings of the Nine Heavens commanded the Supreme Perfected Ones of the Mysterious Capital to cast golden tablets. The assembled sages clarified their meanings, and the Highest Oral Instructions were compiled into numinous chapters. The Jade Emperor inscribed them with his brush, engraving the tablets into scripture. Their structure—with its elevations and descents, ranks and prohibitions—all derived from the esoteric decrees of the Most High Sages. Sealed within the Jade Chamber of the Celestial Palace above the Nine Heavens, they were guarded by the Jade Maidens of the Western Florescence and the Purple Lads of the Golden Dawn of the Primordial Numinous Palace.

Mount Tortoise of the West—also called Dragon Mountain—serves as the root and pivot of the Nine Heavens, the abyssal repository of the myriad qi. Located at the northwest corner of the heavens, it spans four hundred thousand *li* in circumference, its summit contiguous with the Jade Clarity. To the southeast, it adjoins the rosy clouds of the Yang-Pervading Realm, ascending to the Gate of the Divine Tiger of the Azure Palace. To the northwest, it intersects the Frigid Wastes, rising to the Court of the Immortals of the Golden Portals. To the south, it extends to the Crimson Floating Pear Realm, its qi harmonizing with the radiance of the Cavernous Yang. To the north, it points toward the Celestial Enclosure, linking with the Canopy of Flowers, its qi traversing the Vast Numinous. At its center, it aligns directly with the Eightfold Crossroads of the Jade Capital atop the summit of the Intersecting Winds Mountain. Thirty thousand *li* of level heavens are walled in smelted gold and gated in carved jade, adorned with golden terraces, jade towers, and twelve divine palaces.

Above stand the naturally flowing Essence-Purple Towers and Golden Florescence Halls, chambers of chalcedony and jasper, flanked by nine cavernous grottoes. Spontaneous purple clouds arise, interwoven with phoenix-script, their nine hues cascading in array. Cliffs bear purple cassia, ridges flourish with jasper groves, their branches formed of coral, their roots of jade. The trees of the *qian* groves bear fruit, their boughs laden with white jade rings. The Three Florescence blossoms gleam in the crimson radiance, while reverse fragrance flows through the Great Mystery. The Eight Qi fan the whirlwinds, and jade flutes resound in the void, composing celestial music. Dragons roar upon cloud towers, phoenixes cry from perilous peaks. Venomous beasts gather in the thousands, serpents coil a thousand *xun* in length. Divine palaces stand majestic, cloud-borne immortals swarm in profusion. The towering Primordial Halls brim with emanations, for this is the wondrous transformation of the Primordial Origin, the true numinous root of the Celestial Origin.

Within the Golden Florescence Hall, above the northern window, a spontaneous purple qi coalesces into mysterious script. Characters a *zhang* in size descend in radiant splendor, their celestial writing of ineffable subtlety, beyond mortal comprehension.

In the first year of the *Shangjia* era, the Heavenly Venerable of the Nine Heavens fasted in the Cloud Palace and feasted in the radiance of Mount Tortoise. There, he inscribed golden tablets and transcribed the mysterious script, resolving its long-standing obscurities and expounding its numinous resonance. It was recorded as *The Crimson Sovereign’s Flying Dark-Purple Writ of Mount Tortoise*.

On the first *yin* day of the first month of the first year of the *Kaihuang* era, the Queen Mother of the West rode the void in numinous flight, soaring through the Nine Empyreans. She fasted upon Mount Tortoise and ascended the naturally flowing Essence-Purple Tower and Golden Florescence Jasper Hall. Gazing upon the northern window, she paid homage to the mysterious script, contemplating the cliffs in reverence and meditating upon the Supreme Perfected Ones. Thereupon, her wondrous perception awakened, and her cinnabar heart revealed its truth. Suddenly, a Great Divine Perfected One of Heaven appeared, girded with the sun and moon, a halo encircling his neck. Preceded by a retinue of feather-canopied immortals, he arrived upon a flying chariot of ninefold purple clouds, trailing auroral radiance. Kneeling before the Queen Mother, he announced: "I am the Perfected King of the Phoenix Palace of the Nine Heavens, surnamed Supreme Mystery, styled Open Brightness. By command of the Primordial Heavenly King, I bear the Nine Heavens’ Golden Writ in purple characters on azure-golden cinnabar tablets, to bestow upon the Queen Mother." He conferred upon her the title *Supreme Perfected Mother of the Nine Numinous Ones of the Western Origin* and enfeoffed her as the Peak of Western Tortoise. He also bestowed a plain writ containing *The Primordial Record of the Supreme Perfected One’s Transformations at Birth*, entrusting her with the oversight of the immortal registers and the succession of the Jade Clarity.

Additionally, he presented her with azure-jade tablets, a *feng*-robe of flying azure feathers, a Morning Infant Jade Crown, phoenix-cloud sandals, a divine phoenix-purple wheel, a flying feathered canopy of twenty-four carriages, and five-colored banners of numinous command. He further assigned seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Upper Palace’s Golden Florescence to attend the Perfected Mother, who was to govern the flowing Essence-Purple Tower and Golden Florescence Jasper Hall. Thrice each month, she would ascend to the Jade Clarity, twice feast upon Kunlun, and five times review the assembled immortals.

When the Great Divine Perfected One had completed his mission, he returned to his jade palace. The Perfected Mother then ascended her throne and addressed the assembly in the Jasper Hall. She commanded her attendants, the Jade Lad Deng and Dong Shuangcheng, to receive with reverence the golden writ in purple characters on azure-jade tablets, the azure-golden cinnabar writ of imperial bestowal, *The Primordial Record of the Supreme Perfected One’s Transformations at Birth*, and the *Flying Dark-Purple Writ*—four items in total—wrapped in a cinnabar-sovereign seal and enshrined within the chalcedony chamber. She assigned thirty Jade Maidens of the Golden Florescence and thirty Purple Dawn Jade Lads to guard the numinous script. Following the ancient statutes of the Three Heavens’ structural protocols, she reported to the Five Emperors, the Five Peaks, the numinous mountains, rivers, and seas, commanding their deities to submit the names of aspirants five times monthly, distinguishing merits and transgressions by rank for memorialization.

On each of the eight solar terms, and five times each month, the Perfected Mother feasted in the Cloud Palace, traversing the Five Peaks, surveying the sources of rivers, and gazing upon the eight directions. At such times, the Five Planets aligned, the sun and moon paused in their radiance, the hundred yangs discharged lightning, molten gold gleamed with essence, Heavenly Soldiers led the vanguard, and the Five Elders bore banners. The Perfected Mother ever rode her nine-hued chariot of purple-cloud flying wheels, attended by five thousand Jade Maidens of the Celestial Immortals.

Then the women rode phoenixes, the men mounted dragons, and the flying immortals in feathered robes each held floral banners. Reed pipes, flutes, drums, and winds blended in harmonious tones, while luan birds sang and phoenixes cried, their voices ringing through the cloud formations. Radiant lights intertwined, the Three Luminaries merged in brilliance. Purple youths wafted incense to dispel impurities, while divine consorts scattered blossoms to bathe the perfected. Heavenly chimes resounded beneath their banners, purple mists veiled the empty courtyard, jade effulgences streamed across the firmament, and numinous transformations subdued the myriad spirits.

At such times, the Six Heavens obeyed her command, all malevolent forces shrank in form, demons and monsters lost their sight, the heavens cleared, and the air grew pure—truly the wondrous spectacle of lofty immortals, the luminous numen of the Cinnabar Sovereign manifest in its full glory.

**The Cinnabar Sovereign of Tortoise Mountain’s Flying Mystery Purple Writ**
*Flying Mystery Purple Qi congeals the numinous root,*
*The net of Jade Clarity governs the myriad spirits.*
*In the void, it surges and coalesces of itself;*
*Above, twelve towering peaks stand in succession.*

*Jade towers soar resplendent in luminous clouds,*
*Flowing essence graces the purple palace with golden eaves.*
*The jasper hall gleams with the brilliance of the Eight Transcendents;*
*Within, the Nine Numinous Immortals of Azure Gold emerge.*

*The Cinnabar Sovereign True Mother is named Essence-Prolonging,*
*Clad in flying azure feathered robes, crowned with the Morning Infant’s diadem.*
*In her left hand she holds the jade scepter, in her right the numinous banner;*
*Five-colored spirits command the demons, attending the August Honored One.*

*Grasping talismans and registers at the Gate of Life,*
*She chews the moon and sucks the sun, inhaling jade springs.*
*The Net of Separation exhales radiance to refine the five souls;*
*Within, it fills and overflows, delighting the Crimson Palace.*

*Golden light shines resplendent, her form perfectly round.*
*From the new moon she enters the Metal phase, its color turbid and dim—*
*Only the Enlightened One at dawn speaks of this.*
*On the fifth day of the fifth month, the Northern Primordial’s essence,*
*The inscribed canopy appears, leading the immortals.*

*Purple Qi revolves leftward with the Dipper’s motion,*
*Passing through the four sevens to enter the Golden Gate.*
*Just then, the Cinnabar Sovereign reviews the myriad immortals;*
*Those who understand this secret must redouble their diligence.*

*Clothe your form and concentrate your thoughts, ever keeping them distinct;*
*When wondrous visions respond, grasp the essential writ.*
*After three years, you shall surely preserve your wholeness;*
*After nine years, you shall ascend through the void to don the feathered skirt.*

*Lightly soaring in phoenix robes, you shall ascend Dragon Mountain,*
*Gazing up and down to the Nine Numinous Ones, you shall pay homage to the Jade Dawn.*
*The Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen declared:*
*This is the writ of congealed Purple Qi and Flying Mystery, inscribed upon the western Tortoise Mountain, flowing essence upon the northern window of the Purple Palace’s Golden Flower Jasper Hall. The Nine Heavens’ Celestial Venerable beheld its chapters and recorded it as the* Tortoise Mountain Cinnabar Sovereign’s Flying Mystery Purple Writ.

*The Queen Mother of the West ever treasured and concealed it; its purport is profound and recondite, all being the subtle rhymes of the Nine Heavens. Without immortal rank, one may not so much as glance at its title. Those who obtain it are all recorded in the Nine Heavens’ registers, their names inscribed upon Tortoise Mountain.*

*The Nine Heavens’ Celestial Venerable instructed:*
*Practice this Way during the ten months of the year—namely, the first through ninth months, and the eleventh and twelfth months. On the third, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month—five times monthly—purify yourself and recite the Mystery Writ once. After midnight, go forth into the central courtyard, gaze upward, and await the Purple Cloud Qi within the Canopy of the Northern Dipper. Observe it revolving leftward from the Dipper’s handle, passing through the twenty-eight lunar lodges in sequence, and returning above the Golden Gate. If the sky is overcast and no light appears, perform this inwardly within your chamber, visualizing the method as above with utmost clarity. Upon completing the visualization, bow four times toward the Purple Cloud, click your teeth thrice, and raise your gaze to pray:*

*This night is clear and bright, the hidden void reveals the true;*
*Flowing clouds drift and linger, golden flowers unfold on four sides.*
*The Cinnabar Sovereign spreads its radiance, the numinous flies in the purple chariot.*
*This evening, it unfolds and arrays itself; Azure Gold confers immortality.*
*Fulfill my supreme aspiration, may my body accord with spontaneity.*
*Bind my life to the moon’s essence, preserve the root of my years and days.*
*May the Three Numinous Ones merge in splendor, eternally abiding on Dragon Mountain.*
*In the secret night, I don pure vestments—grant my request as spoken.*

*Then draw the Purple Qi into your mouth and swallow it twenty-eight times. After three years of this practice, divine perfected beings shall descend as omens upon your sleeping mat. Your body shall be enveloped in Purple Qi, your form interwoven with its glow. Your name shall be inscribed in the Nine Heavens’ registers, and you shall surely ascend as an immortal.*

*The Nine Heavens’ Celestial Venerable said:*
*The heavens’ writs are myriad, each expounding its wonders. Even this single matter suffices to summon numinous perfected beings to descend, to shake their wings in the Nine Empyreans, to soar through the Jade Clarity, and to wander and feast in the Cloud Palace. Were it not a wondrous method, the Queen Mother of the West would not have concealed it within her inner robe, nor would the Great Existence have left its prohibitions unspoken.*

*The Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen said:*
*The heavens possess clouds of forbidden Qi that encroach upon the divisions of the sun, moon, and five planets. In those regions and kingdoms, there are always those who accord with the Dao and lords who attain immortality. When such signs appear, their images become visible.*

*The Nine Heavens’ Celestial Venerable said:*
*Upon seeing such clouds, perform the rites and prayers according to the writ—there is no need to wait for an appointed day. Apply yourself diligently, and when the clouds descend, you shall ascend to meet them. Seal this within your heart; do not lightly show it to others. If the Dao is divulged, its numen scatters, and immortals shall have no means to respond.*

**The Highest Primordial Bestows the Azure Gold Cinnabar Sovereign Jade Writ upon the Queen Mother of the West**
*The Most High Primordial addressed the Numinous Nine Heavens and the Ancestral Void:*
*The Queen Mother of the West, whose name is Graceful Robe, is the Qi of the Nine Numinous Ones of the Heavens, the coalesced essence of the Western Metal, the embodied bones of Purple Cloud, the refined radiance of the sun’s essence. She inhales and exhales the splendor of the seven luminaries, harmonizes with the morning auroras to feast on the marrow of the sun’s phoenix, and sips the moon’s essence and orchid brain. It congeals within the jade root and golden storehouse, binding and weaving her cinnabar form, her purple heart entwined in eightfold coils. Manifest in the Cinnabar Sovereign’s wondrous chart, she is exalted among the imperial chariots, reposing in the numinous peaks, her heart ashen in the Upper Clarity. Her merits aid the ten thousand kinds, her kindness overflows all living beings. Holding fast to her singular integrity, she endures through kalpas unending. Thus did the Highest Primordial of the Curved Flower bestow upon her this writ.*

*For Graceful Robe’s virtue of Golden Perfection, he conferred upon her the title of Azure Gold Cinnabar Sovereign, the Transcendent Mother of the Nine Numinous Ones of the Western Primordial. He invested her with rulership over Tortoise Mountain, entrusting her with the governance of the primordial registers. In accordance with the rhythms of inhalation and exhalation, he granted her the Azure Jade Tablet inscribed in gold and jade script, the Nine Heavens’ phoenix robes of flying azure feathers, the Morning Infant’s jade crown and phoenix-cloud sandals, twenty-four chariots of divine phoenixes with purple wheels and flying feathered canopies, five-colored staffs and banners as tokens of command over the numinous, flowing-gold fire bells and night-shining candles, jade writs to extinguish demons and Nine Heavens’ imperial decrees as pledges. To guard her, he assigned seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Upper Palace and Western Flower, who attend her in the Flowing Essence Purple Palace and Golden Flower Palace on Western Tortoise Mountain. Thrice monthly she ascends to the Jade Clarity, twice she feasts on Kunlun. She reviews the multitudes of immortals, and the Five Peaks, rivers, seas, and the deities of the ten directions—none are beyond her governance, as fully set forth in this writ.*

All ritual protocols shall follow the ancient statutes of the Jade Terrace’s *Great Possession* and the orthodox texts of the Three Heavens. The issuance of azure-jade tablets inscribed with golden script and jade characters, the Azure-Golden Cinnabar August Writs—all derive from the celestial norms of the *Great Possession* Palace’s *Yin-Yang* protocols, all composed in the spontaneously generated chapters of the *High Mystery Cavern Void*, to be conferred upon the offices of the loftiest perfected and sagely beings, not bestowed upon novices. Even the Golden Tower’s Eastern Florescence and Square Cauldrons Palaces possess their own ritual protocols for summoning novice ascended immortals. These, too, originate from the *Great Possession*’s norms, differing only in rank and hierarchy.

Unless one’s name is recorded in the Nine Heavens or inscribed in the Square Cauldrons’ registers, one shall never glimpse their contents. Those who obtain sight of their texts are destined for rebirth with inscribed tablets, their names listed in the Emperor’s celestial ledgers, fated to attain divine transcendence—thus preordained in the numinous statutes. On the day of Daoic attainment, celestial perfected beings shall naturally descend to receive their writs and conferred texts.

The Southern Culmen’s Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: The golden script and jade characters are all engraved upon azure-jade tablets, or inscribed upon green-jade tablets. Each tablet measures nine inches and nine fen in length, two inches and four fen in width, with characters threaded in gold. Two jade lads and two jade maidens attend each tablet, managing incense and verifying seals. According to the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, if a qualified recipient exists within a century, a single transmission is permitted.

The Southern Culmen’s Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: Azure-jade is not something worldly beings may employ. If one’s name is recorded in the Square Cauldrons and one gains sight of its texts, one may also engrave them upon green-wood tablets, threading the characters in gold, storing them in a sapphire brocade pouch. After burning incense and performing obeisance for nine years, celestial perfected beings shall naturally descend to bestow the azure-jade tablets.

The Southern Culmen’s Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: The primordial registers of incipient transformation and the *Nine Qi*’s *Primordial Cavern* arose together. The Supreme Jade Emperor, the august sagely and imperial perfected, all compose their names and titles from the *Primordial Cavern*’s qi, while their robes, crowns, and adornments derive from the *Great Possession*’s *Yin-Yang* ritual protocols. Even their native villages and district names arise spontaneously. Heaven possesses the qi of the Eight Assemblies and the revolutions of the Four Epochs, which govern the Jade Void, divide and regulate yin and yang, initiate the mysterious transformations, and engender the myriad forms. The transformations and luminous manifestations of the loftiest sages shift with the four seasons, aligning with cosmic revolutions and celestial decrees, advancing with the flux of change—without aging or decline, enduring eternally in transformation. Thus it is said: *The Dao has no constant name*—this is what it means.

The Queen Mother’s virtue repays the High Mystery, making her the mother of the myriad qi. Therefore, the Primordial Commencement conferred the title of Cinnabar August upon her, bestowing a scroll of the *Primordial Writ of Plain Text* to transmit to later sagely and transcendent disciples, so they may know that the Primordial Commencement’s Dao composes spontaneously generated titles and possesses the qi of transformation. Those who glimpse its chapters shall have their names pre-inscribed in the Nine Heavens’ immortal ledgers and engraved upon the Cinnabar Terrace of the Square Cauldrons. By refining their concentrated thought without exceeding nine years, they shall attain the privilege of beholding the perfected in their chambers, transforming with the four seasons and soaring through the Nine Heavens.

The Southern Culmen’s Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: The High Mystery’s precious scriptures of the *Upper Clarity*’s Dao employ visualization as resonance and qi-swallowing as convergence. Once one gains access to their contents, one should immediately clarify the visualized images of the Primordial Commencement’s transformations, discerning their forms, colors, luminous qi, and adornments as they shift with the four seasons. Then, upon closing the eyes and refraining from speech, they shall naturally arrive; upon swallowing qi without deliberate induction, they shall naturally converge. If one does not behold the divine within a decade, or if one’s qi does not flourish within a month—later learners and worthies may yet diligently refine their thought, for the namable exists within the *Mysterious Void*, and the means to transcendence shall arise.

The Southern Culmen’s Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: Those who cultivate the Dao of upper transcendence—visualizing deities, invoking the perfected, ingesting qi, and swallowing saliva—yet remain ignorant of the Primordial Commencement’s titles, the root origins of the four seasons’ transformations, shifting luminous manifestations, and qi, merely close their eyes in vast obscurity, swallow emptily without intent—how shall the perfected deities descend? How shall qi and saliva flourish? Facing one another with gazes, there is already dimness; how much more so in the boundless expanse, where forms and qi remain undifferentiated? Such efforts are but futile exertions in repose, profitless in empty recitation.

**The Primordial Register of the Upper Clarity’s Incipient Transformations**

The Primordial August Supreme Elder, the qi of the Primordial Jade Void, tabooed name *Yanshiyin*, styled *Guanwu Jue*, stands nine thousand myriad zhang in height. During the three months of spring, he wears the *Nine Qi*’s *Flowing Essence Purple Radiance* crown, robes of nine-light brocade, and a sash of naturally seamless nine-colored silk, girded with *Six Mountains Fire Jade*. He perpetually rides clouds of azure and verdant hues, and when seated, nine-colored lions radiate dazzling brilliance. In the *Upper Clarity*’s *Jade Void*, when visualized, he returns to a height of nine inches and nine fen.

During the three months of summer, the Primordial August Supreme Elder transforms into a single body with nine heads, standing seven thousand zhang tall, crowned with nine-colored clouds, clad in a robe of cinnabar brocade woven with hundredfold luminous transformations, girded with the *Nine Great Immortals’ Refined Sword*, riding clouds of cinnabar and purple hues, seated upon nine-colored dragons, their radiance flowing and resplendent. In the *Jade Void*’s purple clouds, when visualized, he returns to a height of nine inches.

During the three months of autumn, the Supreme Elder transforms into a single body with nine phoenix heads, standing five thousand zhang tall, clad in tiger robes of nine-colored stripes, riding seven-colored clouds, their radiant splendor intermingling. In the *Upper Clarity* above, when visualized, he returns to a height of seven inches and seven fen.

During the three months of winter, the Supreme Elder transforms into a luminous manifestation of azure and black hues, vibrant as the moon’s essence—this is the reversion of the *Jade Void*’s qi, where he refines and receives the Primordial Commencement’s essence. When visualized, he reverts to his original primordial true form.

To cultivate the Dao of the Primordial Commencement, on the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), bathe and enter the chamber, face east, and pay homage to the Primordial August Supreme Elder with nine bows. Then turn north, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the Supreme Elder’s four-seasonal forms in the *Upper Clarity*’s *Golden Luminance Palace*, *Jade Heaven Mansion*, *Eightfold Radiance District*, *Fixed Perfection Hamlet*, where he revolves the true and descends to illuminate one’s *Ming Tang* (Hall of Light). Silently recite the invocation:

The August Supreme unfolds the true, the nine Dao converge in radiance, transforming and refining the void, penetrating and illuminating the *Upper Clarity*. His form divides and radiates in effulgent manifestations, the four seasons flow in harmony, and I partake of his truth, merging with the numinous. Within, the *Jade Immortal* coalesces; without, the *Eightfold Obscurity* entwines. The *Eight Effulgences* lend their wings, conveying the *Cinnabar Chariot*. Riding clouds and mounting mist, he urges his steed through the *Upper Clarity*, soaring through the *Cloud Chambers* to pay homage at the *Imperial Capital*. Upon completion, he tilts his head to swallow the nine qi and ceases.

One who knows the inner secret names of the *Primordial Commencement*’s transformations and luminous manifestations shall attain a lifespan of nine hundred years. After nine years of cultivation, one may commune with the divine in countenance and transform one’s effulgence to soar through the great void.

The *Lofty Numinous Nine-Heaven King*, the qi of the *Primordial Void*, bears the secret name *Upper Vision of the Cavern* and the style *Moving Brahma*, his form spanning ninety million *zhang*. In the three months of autumn, he dons a *Golden Flower Crown*, robes of cloud-patterned brocade, and a *Ninefold Radiant Tinkling Girdle* of interwoven purple cords. He rides clouds of cinnabar and azure hues, seated upon nine-colored lions, his luminosity resplendent in the *Upper Clarity*, visualized as seven inches in length. In the three months of winter, the *Lofty Numinous Nine-Heaven King* transforms into a nine-headed form, each head crowned with a sun, his body clad in a nine-colored, feather-patterned phoenix robe. He ever rides clouds of azure and yellow, seated upon nine-colored lions, his radiant brilliance blazing in the *Upper Clarity*, visualized as reverting to his true form. In the three months of spring, the *Nine-Heaven King* divides his form into nine figures, each mouth holding a moon, clad in phoenix-patterned feathered robes. He ever rides nine-colored clouds, seated upon nine-colored mists, his luminosity resplendent in the *Upper Clarity*’s *Great Void*, visualized as reverting to his true form. In the three months of summer, the *Nine-Heaven King* transforms into a singular form of azure, purple, cinnabar, and crimson light, his qi chaotic and illuminating the nine heavens—this is the reversion of the *Great Void*’s qi, where he refines and receives the essence of the nine heavens, visualized as reverting to his true form.

To cultivate the Dao of the *Nine-Heaven True King*, on the day of the winter solar term, bathe and enter the chamber, face west, and pay homage to the *Nine-Heaven King* with nine bows. Then turn north, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the *Nine-Heaven King*’s four-seasonal forms in the *Upper Clarity*’s *Golden Orchid Palace*, *Grand Clarity Mansion*, *Luminous Manifestation Hamlet*, *Penetrating Truth Village*, where he revolves the true and descends to illuminate one’s *Upper Cinnabar Field*. Silently recite the invocation:
*Ninefold Numinous Primordial Essence, transform and refine the Upper Radiance,
Triune convergence in effulgent harmony, qi dispersing form,
Emerging from emptiness, entering the mysterious,
Above yellow, below azure,
Through cyclic revolutions of dawn,
Interlacing the vermilion chariot,
Wandering the lofty void,
Revolving to illuminate my court,
Merging with the true light,
Divine transformations beget life,
Able to ride clouds and float,
Playfully ascending the Upper Clarity.*
Upon completion, tilt the head to swallow the nine qi and cease.

After nine years of cultivation, one’s ascent moves the nine heavens, and the divine true beings descend to bestow upon the practitioner the *True Writ*, naturally enabling one to ride the nine-colored cloud chariot and soar through the *Upper Clarity*.

The *Jade True Nine-Heaven Elder*, the qi of the *Purple Void*, bears the secret name *Prolonging the World’s Radiance* and the style *Linked to the Upper*, his form spanning ninety million *zhang*. In the three months of winter, he dons a *Flying Essence Hundred-Transformations Crown*, a nine-colored, naturally luminous brocade robe, and wields the *Ninefold Primordial Penetrating Truth Talisman*. He ever rides five-colored clouds, seated upon nine-colored mists, his luminosity blazing in the *Upper Clarity*, visualized as nine inches in length. In the three months of spring, the *Jade True Nine-Heaven Elder* transforms into a phoenix with a single body and nine heads, each head crowned with the nine qi of *Mysterious Essence*, clad in a nine-colored, feather-patterned robe. He ever rides twelve flying *lin* beasts, seated upon five-colored lotuses, his luminosity streaming with a hundred shifting hues in the *Upper Clarity*’s *Purple Void*, visualized as reverting to his true form. In the three months of summer, the *Jade True Nine-Heaven Elder* transforms into a dragon-bodied, human-headed form, crowned with twelve-colored light, clad in azure, yellow, and purple feathered robes, his mouth holding a plain sash. He ever rides nine-colored clouds, seated upon five-colored lions, his light illuminating the *Upper Clarity*, visualized as reverting to his true form. In the three months of autumn, the *Jade True Nine-Heaven Elder* transforms into a radiance of purple and emerald hues, his qi intertwining like the sun and moon overlapping—this is the reversion of the *Purple Void*’s qi, where he refines and receives the essence of the nine heavens, visualized as reverting to his true form.

To practice the Dao of the *Jade True Nine-Heaven Elder*, on the day of *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter), bathe and enter the chamber, face the northwest, and pay homage to the *Nine-Heaven Elder* with nine bows. Then turn north, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the *Nine-Heaven Elder*’s four-seasonal forms in the *Upper Clarity*’s *Cinnabar Numinous Palace*, *Opening Clarity Mansion*, *Triune Harmony Hamlet*, *Obscure Truth Village*, where he revolves the true and descends to illuminate one’s *Cavern Chamber*. Silently recite the invocation:
*Numinous One of the Nine Heavens, Primordial and self-so,
Containing and refining the eight Dao, ninefold true embryonic immortals,
The central treasure of purple primal essence, the threefold pure encircling without,
Transforming effulgence, refining qi,
Flowing in harmony with cyclic revolutions,
Penetrating transformations, entering the subtle,
My Dao is early apportioned,
Eyes summoning numinous radiance,
Heart parting the five clouds,
Urging the talisman to enter the effulgence,
Soaring into the imperial dawn.*
Upon completion, tilt the head to swallow the nine qi and cease.

One who knows the inner secret names and styles of the *Nine-Heaven Elder*’s transformations shall have their name inscribed in the nine heavens. After nine years of cultivation, one may behold the true divine, ride the void to soar, and ascend to the *Jade Clarity*.

The *Dao-Root Nine-Heaven Primordial Father*, the qi of the *Cavern Root*, bears the secret name *Ninefold Numinous Guide* and the style *Chaos Great True*, his form spanning ninety million *zhang*. In the three months of spring, he dons a *Sevenfold Vermilion Jade Headband*, the *Boundless Treasure Heaven Crown*, robes of *Nine-Heaven Phoenix Garments* and *Divine Cloud Phoenix Sandals*, and a plain numinous sash. He ever rides a *Flying Jade Canopy*, followed by twelve flying dragons, seated upon nine-colored floral radiance in the *Jade Clarity* above, his luminosity a hundred shifting hues, blazing through the great void, visualized as nine feet in length.

In the three months of summer, the *Primordial Father* transforms his form into one body with nine heads, each head crowned with a sun. He wears a robe of red phoenixes and tiger-fur patterned with striped markings, and a sash of twelve colors. He rides a nine-colored phoenix, seated upon the convergence of yellow and white qi. His radiance blazes through the void, illuminating the *Jade Clarity* within. When visualized, he reverts to his true form.

In the three months of autumn, the *Primordial Father* divides his form into nine figures, all clad in nine-colored feathered robes. Each bears a *Dragon Abyss Sword* at the waist, a tiger-headed pouch, and a plain numinous sash interwoven with divine essence. Seated upon the nine qi of the dark void, their luminosity shifts in a hundred hues, shining resplendent within the subtle realms of the *Jade Clarity* and the depths of the *Cavern Root*. When visualized, he reverts to his true form.

In the three months of winter, the *Primordial Father* transforms into the radiance of solar essence, merging with the purple brilliance. This manifests the reversed form of the *Primordial Father*’s *Dao-Root* qi, which further refines the essence of the *Cavern Root*, uniting with the *Mystic Mother* to generate the dual luminosities of chaos. When visualized, he reverts to his true form.

To practice the *Primordial Father*’s Dao, on the day of the *Grand Year Star*, bathe and purify oneself, enter the chamber, and face the northwest to pay homage to the *Nine-Heaven Primordial Father* with nine bows. Then turn north, sit evenly, close the eyes, and visualize the *Nine-Heaven Father* assuming his four seasonal forms above the *Nine Heavens*, within the *Great Ultimate Jade Palace*, the *Jade Treasure Treasury* of the *Cinnabar Spirit Village* in the *Cavern Origin Hamlet*. As his true form descends in reflection, it enters the adept’s *Upper Origin* within *Kunlun*, whereupon one softly intones:

*"Supreme August Thearch, Primordial Great Divinity,
Conjoined with true qi, your form graces the purple heavens.
Riding clouds and driving the floating, you weave through the eight mists.
Turning the wheel, you descend in arcs, your Dao shading my body.
May I ascend in the cloud chariot, serving the divine axle.
On this day of the Eight Assemblies, I humbly present my supreme wishes.
All that I seek and beseech shall be granted by your grace.
May I eternally enjoy primal fortune, abiding with the Thearch,
Commanding the Eight Effulgences to soar into the *Jade Dawn*."*

When finished, tilt the head back and swallow nine breaths.

After nine years of practice, one beholds the true form, and the *Primordial Father* descends to one’s side, conversing with the adept. He bestows the precious scripture *Nine Heavens Upper Register*, inscribed on jade tablets, and the adept ascends to the *Upper Clarity*.

To recklessly divulge this Dao is to be consigned to the ghostly bureaus for a lifetime, with calamity extending to seven generations, forever bound to the *River Source*.

The *Dao-Pole Nine-Heaven Mystic Mother*, the qi of the *Cavern Abyss*, bears the secret name *Bearer of Chaos* and the style *Yellow Great Cover*. Her form spans seventy million *zhang*. In the three months of autumn, she wears a *Purple Origin Dark Void Treasure Crown*, a *Verdant Spirit Radiant Light* brocade robe woven with frost-like *Nine-Colored* patterns, and a twelve-hued luminous sash interwoven with purple essence. She ever rides a *Flying Purple Cloud Chariot*, followed by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six immortals, seated upon nine-colored lions. Her radiance flows and shines, dwelling above the *Upper Clarity*. When visualized, she measures six *cun* and six *fen* in length.

In the three months of winter, the *Mystic Mother* transforms her form into a human-headed, bird-beaked figure, her mouth holding the essence of the moon. She wears a *Verdant Essence Flying Gauze* robe and a flowing sash of purple tassels. She ever rides twelve-colored clouds, seated amidst a hundred shifting luminosities that illuminate the subtle realms of the *Upper Clarity* within. When visualized, she reverts to her true form.

In the three months of spring, the *Mystic Mother* transforms into a phoenix-bodied, qilin-headed figure, resplendent in seven colors and twelve effulgences, her radiant essence interwoven and shining through the subtle realms of the *Upper Clarity* and the depths of the *Eight Obscurities*. When visualized, she reverts to her true form.

In the three months of summer, the *Mystic Mother* transforms into a dual radiance of purple and yellow, like the moon’s brilliance, flowing in five hues that illuminate the *Upper Clarity*. This manifests the reversed form of the *Mystic Mother*’s *Cavern Origin* qi, which further refines the essence of the *Dao-Pole Nine Yin*. The *Feminine One* unites in celebration, giving birth to the myriad spirits. When visualized, she reverts to her true form. After nine years, the *Primordial Father* bears the register in *Nanyang*, and the *Mystic Mother* descends in form to the *Cinnabar Chamber*.

To practice the *Mystic Mother*’s Dao, on one’s *Life-Destiny Day*, bathe and purify oneself, enter the chamber, and face the southeast to pay homage to the *Mystic Mother* with nine bows. Then turn north, sit evenly, and strike the teeth nine times. Close the eyes and visualize the *Nine-Heaven Mystic Mother* assuming her four seasonal forms above the *Nine Heavens*, within the *Jasper Grove Sevenfold Radiance Palace*, the *Jade Treasure Cavern Origin Treasury* of the *Nine-Light Village* in the *Upper Clarity Hamlet*. As her true form descends in reflection, it enters the adept’s *Gate of Life* below the navel within the *Cinnabar Field Palace*, whereupon one softly intones:

*"Triple union and quintuple separation, the dual origins merge in transformation.
Qi congeals and spirit coalesces; spirit transforms and merges with the hun-soul.
The Feminine One embraces the true, the womb’s breath births the gate.
Yin essence mystically descends, washing and irrigating the wellsprings of form.
Refining and transmuting, the luminous effulgence arises naturally.
Today I humbly present my plea; may the Mystic Mother grant my wishes.
Twelve supreme vows safeguard the completion of my jade perfection.
Five forms receive the radiant blessings, my bones refined into jade immortality.
Light of body, I soar and fly, riding the void and weaving through the mists.
Ascending to the Purple Ultimate, I attend upon the divine countenance."*

When finished, tilt the head back and swallow twenty-seven breaths.

After nine years of practice, the *Mystic Mother* is moved to joy, and the two effulgences unite in harmony. She commands the *Northern Thearch* to erase the adept’s name from the registers of death, presenting the *Nine Heavens Record* inscribed on purple tablets. One beholds her true form and soars into the *Upper Clarity*.

To recklessly divulge this Dao is to be consigned to the *River Source* in death, with seven generations bearing servitude, enduring ten sufferings and eight calamities—blade mountains and sword trees—through ten thousand kalpas without redemption. Those who receive it must treasure its secrecy to naturally attain immortality.

The *August Elder of the Three Heavens*, the qi of the *Cavern Void*, bears the secret name *Supreme Stabilizer* and the style *Luminous Brahma Ancestor*. His form spans thirty million *zhang*. In the three months of spring, he wears a *Seven Treasures Pearl Crown* of *Pervasive Essence*, a robe of *Flying Cloud Flowing Light Purple Brocade*, and bears the *Single August Mandate Spirit Seal*. He ever sits amidst five-colored, hundredfold-shifting radiance, his brilliance resplendent, dwelling above the *Upper Clarity* within the *Cavern Void*.

This is the *August Elder* reverting to the *qi* of the *Cavern Void*, further refining and receiving the essence of the *August Elder of the Three Heavens*. When visualized, he reverts to his true form.

To cultivate the *Way* of the *August Elder of the Three Heavens*, one must on the days of *jiazi* and *gengshen*, bathe, purify, and enter the chamber. Facing west, bow thrice in reverence, then complete the audience with the *August Elder of the Three Heavens*. Turn north, sit evenly, knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, and visualize the *August Elder of the Three Heavens* in his four seasonal forms, residing in the *Jade Flow Palace* of the *Upper Clarity*, within the *Golden Fusion Prefecture* at *Prime Origin Village of the Open Realm*. The true light descends, illuminating the practitioner’s *Flower Canopy*, then softly recite:

Three spirits transform,
Five gods intermingle,
Within, golden immortals abide,
Without, the true visage refines.
Jade pool’s flower dew
Moistens the purple chamber,
The true returns in hidden shade,
Illuminating the five palaces.
Inner fragrance, outer purity,
Bones like orchid, stomach like musk,
Nine apertures receive the numinous,
Immortal light overflows and fills.
Ascend upon flying clouds,
Enter the imperial hall.

Upon completion, swallow the *qi* twenty-seven times and cease.

This is the secret script of the Nine Heavens, mystically transmitted to perfect the *true person*. After nine years of cultivation, one may meet the *true person* face-to-face, their name inscribed in the imperial register, and their form depicted in the Three Origins. Should one lightly divulge or neglect this, the Nine Heavens shall punish with the *Wind Blade*, and nine generations shall be conscripted into servitude, barred from entering immortality.

The *Jade Lad of the Lofty Three Heavens*, born of the *qi* of *Primal Void*, bears the taboo name *High Jade Kidney* and the style *Eternally Present*. His form spans thirty million *zhang*.

To cultivate the *Way* of the *Jade Lad of the Three Heavens*, one must on the day of the *Great Year Star*, purify, and enter the chamber. Facing south, bow thrice in reverence, then complete the audience with the *Jade Lad of the Three Heavens*. Turn north, sit evenly, knock the teeth three times, close the eyes, and visualize the *Jade Lad of the Three Heavens* in his four seasonal forms, residing in the *Jasper Upper Palace* of the *Upper Clarity*, within the *Cinnabar Bright Prefecture* at *Threefold Plain Village of the Prime Origin*. The true light descends, illuminating the space between the practitioner’s brows, then softly recite:

Three lights gleam bright,
Six *qi* rise pure,
Embracing the true, securing the radiance,
*Qi* intertwines, flowers bloom.
Golden immortal parents,
Nurture the fetal infant,
A hundred spirits feed and nourish,
Mystically irrigate my [form, enabling me to] soar in radiance,
Bones ascend, flesh lightens,
Wander the cloud palaces,
Enter and exit the eight darknesses,
Align with the Dao, equal the true,
Three Origins share the same age.

Upon completion, raise the head and swallow the *qi* three times, then cease.

This is the secret *Way* of the Three Heavens, the *Orthodox Unity Jade Scripture*, concealed within the *Three Treasures Palace*. It must not be recklessly transmitted. Merely glimpsing its title and cultivating for nine years, one may merge with the true and soar through the *Jade Clarity*. Should one lightly divulge the celestial treasure, they shall be punished with the *Wind Blade*, the Nine Heavens shall punish the transgressor, seven generations shall be conscripted into servitude, and barred from entering immortality.

To cultivate the *Way* of the *Nine Firmaments Elder*, one must on the day of *Beginning of Autumn* and one’s *Life Destiny Day*, purify, and enter the chamber. Facing west, bow nine times in reverence, then complete the audience with the *Elder*. Turn north, knock the teeth three times, close the eyes, and visualize the *Elder* in his four seasonal forms, residing in the *Jade Clarity Initiating Golden Palace* within the *Double Darkness Prefecture* at *Sixfold Union Village of the Harmonized Realm*. The true light descends, illuminating the practitioner’s nine apertures, then softly recite:

The Jade Clarity revolves ninefold, divine perfected ones scatter their numen, the Six Voids pour forth primordial essence. The Lofty One streams forth essence, blending and reverting to the womb, receiving refinement and transformation, cycling through four revolutions. My Dao gleams luminous, the Great One inscribes the record, the Primordial Lord notes my birth. Five talismans interlace, nourishing my form; the Three Palaces and Eight Sceneries convey the purple chariot. I don the feathered garb of flying immortals, emerald skirts and azure brocade, twin pendants tied with sashes, golden talismans and jade bells. The perfected one descends to bestow, enabling me to ascend the pure, tread the void, and step upward to audience at the imperial court. Upon completion, raise the head and swallow the nine qi to cease.

This is the supreme Dao of the Nine Heavens, concealed within the Jade Chamber, revealed but once in ten thousand kalpas.

In the three months of winter, he wears the Golden Flower Flying Heaven Crown, robes embroidered with sun-born streaming essence, bears the Flowing Gold Phoenix Seal, and girds the Hundred-Transformations Interlocking Gold Sword.

To cultivate the Dao of the Nine Clarities True King, one must on the day of *Autumn Equinox* and the *Year-Star Day*, purify, and enter the chamber. Facing northwest, bow nine times in reverence, then complete the audience with the True King. Turn north, knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, and visualize the True King in his four seasonal forms, residing in the *Sevenfold Radiance Palace* of the Jade Clarity, within the *Phoenix-Born Prefecture* at the *Upper Void Village of Transformed Immortals*. The true light descends, illuminating the nine apertures of the practitioner’s origin and the upper pass. Then softly recite:

The ninefold Dao radiates luminous,
the Purple Clarity branches and flows.
The three qi merge in primordial chaos,
uniting with the true and profound pivot.
Mysterious numen spreads primordial essence,
dispersing and transforming the Upper Void.
The Peerless One escorts the Elder,
the White Prime transmits the talisman.
The Controller of Destinies inspects life,
the five spirits bathe the body.
The Dao unites to perfect the true,
the Primordial Emperor becomes my peer.
Above, I ascend to the mysterious chart,
flying and ascending to the Great Vastness.

Upon completion, raise the head and swallow the nine qi to cease. This is the supreme secret Dao, concealed within the Ninefold Winding Jade Terrace, transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas according to the statutes of the Highest Perfected. Unless one is of wondrous and transcendent quality, their name inscribed in the Nine Heavens, they may not partake in its knowledge. Whoever beholds this text shall have a lifespan equal to a kalpa; cultivating it for nine years, one ascends and flies to the Highest Clarity. To lightly divulge these numinous writings is to invite death and forfeit immortality.

The Lofty Void Emperor Lord is the qi of the Primordial Highest Emperor, named *Profound Creation*, styled *Great Dharma Illuminator*, his form spanning seven thousand myriad leagues.

To cultivate the Dao of the Lofty Void Emperor, one must on the ninth day of the ninth month and the third day of the third month, bathe, purify, and enter the chamber. Facing north, sit evenly and bow nine times in reverence. Then sit facing north, knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize the Lofty Void Emperor in his four seasonal forms, residing in the *Primordial Treasure Palace* of the Highest Clarity, within the *Golden Upper Prefecture* at the *Village of Radiant Light in the Convergence and Divergence Township*. The true light descends, illuminating the upper origin blood and fluid palace of the practitioner. Then softly recite:

The Nine Heavens converge and diverge,
flying roots bind the true.
The cavernous radiance of the Lofty Spirit,
yellow clouds inwardly entwine.
Treasure radiance purifies and illumines,
falling blossoms birth mist.
Secure and stabilize the Upper Origin,
illuminating my body.
The Three Palaces refine and protect,
the Six Treasuries gleam with essence.
Wielding the Eight Sceneries,
the Mysterious Elder revolves.
Treading the void and stepping through space,
entering and exiting without hindrance.
Above, I assist the Lofty Void Emperor,
as a servant of the Highest Emperor.
The Eight Assemblies celebrate and receive,
as I petition according to what is recited.

Upon completion, raise the head and swallow the nine qi to cease. This is the supreme secret Dao of transformations and blended generation; those who know it become peers of the Lofty One. Cultivating it for nine years, one flies and traverses the Jade Clarity. To lightly divulge it is to incur the punishment of seven generations, one’s body enslaved at the river’s source. According to the statutes of the Nine Heavens, one may not attain immortality.

His radiance descends to illuminate one’s spirit portal. Then softly invoke:

*"Radiant Emperor, Primordial Dao,
Lofty Purple Primordial, thrice-transformed, nine-fold merged,
Knit the Grotto Gate’s formation.
Crimson essence gleams resplendent,
Flying forth in yellow clouds.
Five talismans secure deathlessness,
Preserve life’s enduring span.
Returning truth blends in union,
Let me attain divine transformation.
Three Palaces settled in peace,
Nine Orifices knit as immortal.
Four seasons’ changes align,
With the Emperor’s true merging."*

When finished, tilt the head back and swallow nine breaths to conclude.

This is the secret Dao of the Lofty Primordial, where three transformations and nine refinements naturally perfect the true.
