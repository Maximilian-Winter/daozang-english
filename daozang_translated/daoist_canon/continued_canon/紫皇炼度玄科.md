*The Purple Sovereign’s Mysterious Rites of Refinement and Liberation*
The ritual proceeds according to form. The attending officers burn the talismans for the numinous guard. The chief cantor intones, and all bow to the masters, maintaining mindfulness as prescribed.

**Invocation of the Divine Incantation:**
The Five Stars array their radiance, illuminating the Five Directions.
The Primordial Sovereign shields the hun-soul; the Cinnabar Elder guards the form.
The Luminous Numinous attends the po-soul; the Dark Emperor sustains life.
The Yellow Emperor of the Center governs all perfected beings.
The Primordial Sovereign decrees below: the dark night unfolds its light.
Sins dissolve in the Northern Bureau; names are inscribed in the Southern Palace.
The Golden Register confers rank; the Jade Script dispels calamity.
The Scarlet Mound receives refinement; the spirit soars to the Great Azure.
The Three Palaces and Nine Bureaus, the boundless divine realm—
All universally receive liberation, refined and transformed into celestial paradise.
Harmony unites with the Dao, merging with the true.

The chief cantor concludes.
The attending officers burn the furnace-activating talisman.
The ritual drum is struck twenty-four times. The high priest recites...

The Supreme Three Heavens, the Great Dark Heaven of Taiying, the Qi of the Purple Sovereign Heavenly Lord—summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officials, the Attendants of the Left and Right, the Courier Dragon Riders bearing incense, the Golden Lads attending incense, the Jade Maidens scattering flowers, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talisman Officials and Daily Incense Officers, each thirty-six in number, to emerge. Let those who emerge don solemn attire, display their regalia, and adorn themselves with caps and pendent tassels. Let them report to the local earth deities and the divine guardians of this domain.

This servant now, in proper ritual order, refines and delivers, ascending the altar to reverently memorialize: the sincerity of this petition has already been fully presented. This servant now petitions [□#1]; may the qi of the Five Numinous Mysterious Origin of the North descend and flow into the bodies of this servant and company, that the sincerity of this servant’s invocation may swiftly reach the Supreme Perfected Three Treasures, the Ancestral Master and Lord of the Teachings, the Dark Heaven Purple Sovereign Emperor.

The chief cantor intones: *Invoking the sacred ranks.*

This humble servant [Name], with awe and trepidation, prostrates and bows his head, reverently addressing the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms, the August Heaven Supreme Jade Sovereign Emperor, the North Pole Purple Tenuity Subduer of Demons Great Emperor, the Celestial Emperor of the Gouchen Star Palace, the Earthly Sovereign Empress of Bearing Heaven and Effecting the Dao, the Divine Numinous Perfected King and Longevity Great Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion Who Answers Cries, the Ten Directions Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies, the Five Emperors of the Five Directions, the Nine Heavens Life-Generating Emperor, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords, the Azure Radiance East Primeval Yang Compassionate Father, the Golden Perfection West Primordial Mother, the Palace of the Sun’s Supreme Solar Emperor, the Mansion of the Moon’s Supreme Lunar Sovereign, the Star Lords of the Southern Dipper Who Refine the Hun-Souls, the Star Lords of the Northern Dipper Who Forge the Po-Souls, the Vermilion Mound Great Emperor of the Southern Culmen, the Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity’s Deities of Destiny, Registers, Longevity, and Life-Extension Who Refine and Transform, the Great Deities Who Revive the Dead and Oversee Life, the Perfected of the Ninefold Radiance Who Preside over Refinement, the True Lords of the Upper and Lower Vermilion Mound Fire Palaces, the Three Primordials, Three Grades, and Three Officials Great Emperors, the Five Masters of the Numinous Treasure, the Primordial Lady of the Western Jade Terrace Who Upholds the Dao, the Thunderclap Three Ministries’ Supreme Ministers Perfected Lords, the Ancestral Master and Lord of the Teachings, the Jade Void Preceptor and Purple Sovereign Dark Heaven Emperor, the Ancestral Master Western River Salvific Perfected of Compassion, the Qingwei, Lingbao, and Purple Court Fengdu Dongyue Lineage Transmitting Masters, the Perfected Lords of the Five Bureaus Who Gather the Hun-Souls at Childhood’s Dawn, the Fire Official of the Great Yang, the Water Official of the Great Yin, the Water Palace Fusang Great Emperor, the Southern Prosperity Refinement Bureau’s Envoys of the Fire Marsh and Water Pool, the Venerable Deities of the Jade Eyes Refining Essence, the Venerable Deities of the Golden Liquor Refining Form, the Bing-Ding Vermilion Bird Divine Lords, the Venerable Deities of the Yellow Radiance Who Purify Form, the Primordial Lady of the Stone Mirror Water Mother, the Ren-Gui Dark Warrior Divine Lords, the Envoys of the Northern Capital’s Frigid Pool, the Venerable Deities Who Nurture the Hun and Po, the Great Generals of the Twelve Qi of Chaos Primordial Who Generate Life, the Heavenly Medical Great Sage, the Divine Tiger Marshals He and Qiao, the Fire Palace Courier Lads of the Xuandu Reed Dragon, the Nine Dragons Talisman Envoys, the Five Directions’ Five Numinous Lads, the True Lords of the Offering Altar, and all assembled mighty spirits.

With reverence, this servant beseeches the Dao’s compassion to turn its profound gaze upon this rite, undertaken on behalf of the deceased [Name], who has passed beyond this realm, their fate unknown between ascent and descent. Relying upon the Most High’s boundless mercy, this servant invokes the mysterious rites to purify and refine them. Humbly drawing upon the profound power of the Dao, may they swiftly attain transcendence.

This servant, by virtue of past karmic affinity, dares to perform these secret arts. Yet the true water and true fire’s ascending and descending functions remain obscure; the numinous palace and numinous source’s fundamental principles of dryness and moisture remain unknown. Without the Dao’s power, how could refinement be achieved? Thus, with earnest sincerity, this servant presumes to trouble the lofty Perfected Ones’ attention. May they command the chariot of five-colored floating clouds and raise the banner of ninefold radiant light. May the golden lads and jade maidens attend in harmony, the generals, officers, and divine soldiers manifest in majesty. Deign to descend to this ritual altar, preside over the refinement and deliverance, and receive this memorial, which shall now be reverently recited.

*Recitation of the Purple Sovereign’s Memorial.*
*Recitation of the Petition Concluded.*

The High Priest intones:

Your servant has heard: the essence of the sun and the radiance of the moon broadly illuminate the earth below; the southern *Li* and northern *Kan* together bring warmth and moisture to living beings. To gather the hun-souls with the spirit and form, one must return in reverence to the compassionate Creation.

Humbly beseeching the Master’s mercy, may true water and true fire be specially arrayed, descending to the Flowery Pool, allowing this servant to refine and deliver. Solemnly praying for the issuance of decrees, may commands be sent to:

The Radiant Primordial Perfected of Pure Yang within the Sun, the Firelight Lads, General Yu-yi, the Fire Bell Lads, the Lady of Yellow Radiance and Flowing Light within the Moon, the Round Light Lads, General Jie-lin, the Yin-Yang Gatekeepers Gou and Bi of the Thunder Gate, the Four-Eyed Elder and Elder Gao-diao of the Heavenly Peng Gate, the Three Divine White Owls and the Four Great Generals of Long-Skulled Mighty Beasts, the Four Primordial Spirits of Chen, Tang, Song, and Xue, Marshal Chen of the Great Mystery’s Severing, Marshal Wen of the Southern Palace’s Expulsion of Evil, Marshal Yi-qi the Great General of the Talisman Envoys for Pursuing Consumption, Seizing Wasting, and Opening the Heart, Marshal Wen the Earth Spirit’s Illustrious and Martial, the Two Marshals Zhao and Tao of Water and Fire, the Water Pool Envoy Great Spirit Zheng, the Fire Marsh Envoy Great Spirit Bai, the Two Great Generals Guarding the Male and Embracing the Female, the Great Spirit Wang Who Cuts Off Ingratitude, the Great Spirit of Uniting Form and Restoring Body, the Twelvefold Qi of the Primordial Chaos Transforming and Generating Great Spirit—

May they now descend to this ritual altar to assist this servant in refinement and deliverance, ensuring that the souls undergoing refinement have their karmic filth dissolved like melting ice, their grievances and transgressions extinguished like dying embers, and that they may receive the merit of transformation, following their karma to be reborn.

This servant, unworthy and foolish, presumes to practice these rites, relying entirely on the true guidance and greatly bestowed with orthodox perfection. May the *qi* of the Dao, the *qi* of life, and the *qi* of Brahma—along with the true *qi* of the Three Lights—flow into this servant’s body, granting the grace of compassionate light to accomplish this sacred task.

All true water and true fire, this servant earnestly beseeches to fly into the Luminous Pool, fulfilling the pledge of efficacy.

This servant, daring to offend the majesty of the Dao, reflects from afar upon the profound grace, silently vowing to repay it with manifest virtue.

The High Priest transforms his spirit, establishing the Fire Marsh and Water Pool, merging water and fire.

The *Ti Hun* incantation is held within secret instructions; before the throne, a gatha is recited.

The High Priest ascends the seat, pinching incense with his left hand and intoning in truth:

This incense, congealed from the Three Pure Ones, its *qi* suffused with the Seven Numinous Spirits—
From the Cinnabar Valley flows its essence, merging the gold’s purity of *Li* and *Kan*;
From the Mystic Terrace is nurtured its excellence, the auspicious union of male and female inscribed in the jade tablets.

The incense is kindled in the censer,
burned within the furnace, offered across the void to
the Primordial Dharma King, the Heavenly Treasure of the Cavern of Perfection,
in reverent dedication for the deliverance of the departed souls.

May a thousand transgressions be absolved, ten thousand sins dissolved.
To the north, may the dark *qi* ascend as spirits, the white tally gleaming with the blessings of compassionate clouds;
to the south, may lives be delivered, the cinnabar talisman melting with the auspicious radiance of the sun of kindness.
May litigation at the tomb cease in the household, and calamities in descendants be stilled.

The High Priest pinches incense with his left hand and invokes:

This incense, its essence divided from the Moon’s Grotto, its excellence nurtured from Heaven’s Root—
Purple smoke ascends to the azure vault, its light illuminating the yang spirits;
colored mists fly along the Yellow Path, their auspiciousness revealing the yin luminaries.

The incense is kindled in the censer,
burned within the furnace, offered across the void to
the Supreme Jade Clarity, the Numinous Treasure of the Cavern of Mystery,
in reverent dedication for the deliverance of ancestral and former souls.

May each awaken to their true nature, suddenly realizing their original state,
relying on the golden tally to emerge from darkness, hearing the sutras and awakening to the Dao;
wielding the jade talisman to ascend through the ranks, refining their substance and attaining perfection.
May they enjoy bliss without striving, carefree and at ease.

The High Priest pinches incense with his right hand and invokes:

This incense, its fragrance rising from the Three Ultimates, its *qi* bestowed by the Five Numinous Spirits—
Its jade splendor shines upon the earth’s blossoms, its emerald flames resplendent;
its golden radiance extends to heaven’s flowers, its mystery brilliant and luminous.

The incense is kindled in the censer,
burned within the furnace, offered across the void.

The Dao of highest virtue, the Divine Treasure of the Cavernous Spirit—offered in prayer for the patron of this retreat, that the Eastern Florescence bestow blessings and the Southern Culmen extend their years. May seven generations of their lineage share in glory, as clouds swiftly borne by the roc’s flight across ten thousand leagues; may five branches flourish in splendor, as cranes and phoenixes harmonize their calls in the nine marshes. May they cultivate poetry and ritual among the pines and vines, and illuminate their native land with music and song.

*Sound the chime*
**Celestial Worthy of Universal Salvation, the Most High**

The High Priest intones directly:

We bow in reverence, for Heaven is called Father and Earth is called Mother, the primal source of all life and generation. Yin becomes the corporeal soul and Yang the ethereal soul, forming the embodied and sentient destiny of beings. All things preserve their nature and life, yet only the One True endures without losing its root—how much more so for humanity, the most spiritually endowed of all.

Yet by the inherent Way of human nature, a single day’s judgments of right and wrong, good and evil, may yield karmic retribution or determine ascent and descent. Though a hundred years may reduce all to decay, the wondrous and the base alike cannot escape. The wheel of rebirth is inescapable; transformation is inevitable. Thus, after death, the wandering soul drifts in darkness, while before birth, the root severs from past attachments. Those who languish through long nights in distant kalpas shall, when their allotted time is spent, find the great cycle open before them; those who ride the dawn and yearn for the light shall, with spirit preserved, awaken to true enlightenment.

We look up to the Most High, who has spread the great Dharma bridge—bestowing benevolence through love of life, and delivering the world through the flow of true precepts. Heaven-one generates water, Earth-two generates fire; refining jade essence with hammer and chisel, fire descends and water ascends. Dui-seven transforms into the tiger, Zhen-three transforms into the dragon; guarding the golden elixir, the dragon chants and the tiger roars. Without the union of water and fire, how could form be restored? Without the fusion of dragon and tiger, how could spirit be perfected? Through this process of generation and completion, it is called *refinement and deliverance*.

Red lead and black mercury—with my spirit, I unite with theirs; the Crimson Palace and the Cinnabar Field—with the body of the Dao, I unite with their body. The qi and essence of liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys nurture and sustain life; the quintessence of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth nourish and cultivate. At this time, we array the radiance of sun, moon, and stars, and establish the Flowery Pond of water and fire. Following the teachings and methods of the Purple Emperor, we refine the ethereal and corporeal souls; we command the officials of the Southern Palace to assist in washing and perfecting form.

May the departed souls before this altar receive deliverance, refining their embryos to return to the root. Once more, they are endowed with the essence of the Five Phases, severing the root of death; anew, they become the most spiritually endowed of all beings. May the sincerity of the patron be fulfilled, the teachings of the Purple Emperor widely propagated, and the sacred name exalted together, as we humbly invoke the grace of their luminous power.

*Sound the chime*
**Celestial Worthy of Limitless Deliverance**

The High Priest now intones, proclaiming to the departed souls:
The four elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—temporarily conjoin to form the human frame;
Ailments, pains, and afflictions coil and cling, becoming the heart’s distress.
Deeply consider: what plagues the living in the yang realm likewise persists in the yin realm.
Though now stilled, the physical form remains untranscended; first, the malevolent manifestations must be purged of illness before one may unite with the True.

The [Celestial] Bureau now respectfully summons the Heavenly Physicians, the Healing Merit Officers, the Divine Lads Who Taste Medicines, the Acupuncture Spirit Officials, the Six Offices of Healing, and all Departments’ Merit Officers.
By the talismanic decree of the Mysterious Heavenly Emperor of the Purple Empyrean, first gather the primordial qi for the departed souls, healing all ailments of the body, all illnesses from their former lives, and dissolving all karmic roots of suffering.
Purge the blood’s impurities, restore the integrity of form and spirit, and by talismanic command, awaken the luminous clarity of their inherent nature to endure refinement and transformation.

The Attending Officers now burn the Heavenly Physician Talisman:
*"Jade Clarity’s Primordial Venerable One, dispatch the Heavenly Physicians below.
Restore the withered and decayed, universally deliver and save all heavenly beings."*

The High Priest draws the qi of the Five Directions, arraying it at the altar’s site of water and fire commingling:
By the Great Supreme’s compassion, the talismanic decree is issued.
The living are preserved whole; the dead are made complete.
Form and spirit both attain perfection, ascending to the Jade Hall.
The Five Qi flow freely, severing the roots of evil.

Red Yao assists the left, Zhen: the paralyzed stretch forth.
Grinding needles aid the right, Dui: the disabled are made whole.
Wax and tallow descend below, Li: the lame and afflicted rise and walk.
Ink ascends above, Kan: ears and eyes become keen and bright.
The numinous treasure at the central Jade: the body grows strong, the frame light.

The Azure Emperor guards the hun at Mao, the Liver-Wood flourishes long.
The Vermilion Emperor nurtures the qi at Wu, the Heart-Fire shines brightly.
The White Emperor attends the po at You, the Lung-Metal is born and perfected.
The Black Emperor channels the blood at Zi, the Kidney-Water becomes limpid and clear.
The Yellow Emperor, central sovereign at the Center, the Spleen-Earth finds peace.

The Brahman qi pervades the cosmos, naturally attaining the True.
The corpse revives from death; white bones become human again.
Deliverance is bestowed upon the dying, the severed restored to life.
Nine harmonies and ten unions transform and ascend to the Upper Clarity.

The High Priest further intones:
The four births and six paths, the ten kinds of sentient beings,
All myriad sufferings of countless deaths—all are made manifest.
With a single touch of celestial light, the talismanic decree flourishes.

The Attending Officers now burn the Blood Lake Talisman and the Privy Tower Talisman, as all recite:
*"Great Supreme Elder, ascend and deliver to the Southern Palace.
The Three Palaces transform, preserving life naturally.
The Emperor of the Sun Palace illumines the earth below;
The Sovereign of the Moon Palace purges the Blood Lake.
The Primordial Emperor descends, irrigating all beings.
Facing the Bureau, attending the Celestial Court, sins vanish from the Three Ways.
The mighty current washes away filth, cleansing the nether ford.
The Primordial Yang Jade Calendar accumulates merit and builds virtue.
All举ed by the Three Realms, bones and image unite with the immortals.
Virtuous merit pierces the heavens, the dark night is illuminated.
Yang Nine summons yang; Yin Six calls forth yin.
Yin and yang conjoin, the decree severs the gate of death."*

The Attending Officers now burn the Separating Womb Talisman, as all recite:
*"The Three Clarities’ supreme transformation establishes the images of the Two Modes.
The hun and shi are refined, the mysterious responds to the divine mechanism.
The meridians are made whole, the hundred bones and four limbs.
The Five Viscera are all complete, ascending to the Purple Tenuity."*

The Attending Officers now burn the Exiting Womb Talisman, as all recite:
*"By the Emperor’s decree, descend into the dark prison.
Burn and scour away filth and turbidity, swiftly attain rebirth."*

The Attending Officers now burn the Scouring Womb Talisman, as all recite:
*"Mysterious Numinous Great Tenuity, essence refines in purity.
The departed souls attain deliverance, penetrating and transcending non-action.
Heaven hangs its signs, refining the departed souls.
The ten kinds of solitary spirits all attain illumination.
Transmuted into human form, the Three Palaces are all enlightened.
The nine orifices align, ascending to Southern Prosperity."*

The Attending Officers now burn the Purifying Corpse Talisman, as all recite:
*"The qi of the Five Phases circulates; the qi of the Three Luminaries soars and floats.
Numinous nectar descends to irrigate; jade liquid permeates the dark.
The hun and shen become clear and upright, returning to the heavens above,
Reuniting with the myriad spirits to roam the Jade Capital.
The heavens are limpid, the qi pure; the Five Colors rise in brilliance.
Sun and moon emit their radiance, refining the body’s form.
The spirit’s essence is inwardly irrigated; fragrant waters refine the essence.
Light and brilliance illuminate and shine, resplendent in the Upper Clarity.
The qi remains unstained by dust; the Five Viscera receive the numinous.
Sins vanish from the Three Ways; misfortunes dissolve in the Nine Nether Realms.
Evil roots are severed; blessings and felicity arise of themselves.
Today’s great vow is proclaimed to all.
The body receives liberation and ascends to the Emperor’s realm.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!"*

*"By the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic decree, deliver the departed spirits.
Blood, corpse, stench, and filth—all malevolence is stilled and pacified.
The Seven Fluids are infused; the Five Viscera are transformed and born.
Ever uphold the divine incantation: Primordial, prosperous, harmonious, and steadfast.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the Primordial Beginning Emperor’s statutes and ordinances!"*

The High Priest draws the qi of the Five Directions and the Three Luminaries, arraying it upon the departed souls, silently intoning:
*"Within the True resides the spirit, the Great Lord of Longevity,
The Peerless Noble Son, the White Prime Venerable Spirit,
The Great Monad Controller of Destiny, Peach and Ginseng united in extension,
Grasping talismans and holding registers, preserving life and rooting existence.
Ascend to the Upper Clarity, enter and exit the Flowery [Palace].
Within the Eight Nether Realms, in the subtlest of spaces,
Below, they guard the human body, the Muddy Pellet and Crimson Palace.
Within, they govern the Five Qi, harmonizing the hundred spirits.
Ten revolutions return the numinous; the myriad qi unite as immortals."*

*Sound the chime*
**Celestial Worthy of the Cinnabar Realm’s Refinement**

The High Priest summons the Fire Refinement Officers and Generals:
Solemnly invoking the Master of Flowing Fire of the Cinnabar Heaven, the True Persons of Refinement and Salvation, the Fire Pool Envoys, the Fire Pool Lads, the Divine Clerks of the Fire Bureau, Marshal Gou Yuan of the Loyalty-and-Filiality Thunder Gate, and all officers, generals, clerks, and soldiers of the Purple Sovereign’s Refinement and Salvation—lead the soul-escorting envoys to guide the departed souls into the Fire Pool for refinement and salvation. Thereby, let karmic filth dissipate like smoke, grievances and transgressions be extinguished like embers, the form fear the Great Yang, and the human substance be reborn anew. As decreed by the Talisman Command of the Purple Sovereign of the Mysterious Heavenly Emperor, swiftly carry this out.

The attending officers burn the Fire Refinement Talismans within the Fire Pool.
All recite the *Central Chapter of the Primordial Beginning*.
The High Priest silently intones:
*"The Lord of the Southern Quarter, the Essence of the Red Emperor,
The Radiant Torch Envoys, the Generals of Bing and Ding,
The Vermilion Phoenix, the Fiery Spirit, the resplendent essence of Yang,
The Five Phases engender transformation, the myriad things take form and live.
By the Emperor’s edict, the envoys must heed:
Seize the departed, summon the soul, refine and salvage the bodily form."*

The High Priest’s eyes flash like lightning,
his left hand stirs the Fire of Wu,
and he exhales qi into it.
Envisioning the Fire Pool, true fire blazing fiercely,
all chant:
*"Spirits of Fiery Essence, streaming light of the Three Terraces,
Refining the embryo, transmuting the substance, the po refined, the hun renewed.
Foul qi falls away, borne aloft on rising smoke.
Yin qi dissolves and disperses; Yang qi blends in harmony.
The spirit grows ever stronger, penetrating deeply into the Fire Realm.
Merging with the Nine Qi, wholly uniting with the Primal Sovereign.
By edict of the Vast Heaven, molten gold scatters its radiance.
The Nine Heavens gleam and descend; steadfast fortune knows no bounds."*

Envision the departed soul within the Fire Pool, receiving refinement:
*"Six Jia and Six Yi refine your Liver Meridian,
generating your majestic spirit, making your body sturdy and light.
Six Bing and Six Ding refine your Heart Meridian,
forging your spirit-qi, preserving your long life.
Six Geng and Six Xin refine your Lung Meridian,
the Large and Small Intestines, the myriad qi latent and luminous.
Six Ren and Six Gui refine your Kidney Meridian,
the Essence of Hua fills the pool, bones and marrow find peace.
Six Wu and Six Ji refine your Spleen Meridian,
prolonging life and enduring vision, flesh and bones become light and pure.
Refine the body, restore the form, transform the substance into the Three Clarities."*

The High Priest arrays Jade Script and Azure Qi upon the departed soul,
and all chant:
*"The Dragon Han vast and boundless, formless and nameless,
Across countless eons, the Yellow Dao shines forth.
Spirits clear and radiant, the Nine Hun exhale their essence.
Jade Clarity gleams, the Great Auroras rise in splendor.
The Primordial Beginning unfolds transformation; all heavens align as one.
The Dao-qi of the Three Origins, the Two Images embrace life.
Those already delivered are delivered; those unformed are formed.
The dead are revived; the withered are made flourishing.
All creatures that creep and breathe, every dark spirit,
Those with child and those with embryo—all attain long life.
The departed whose fate is spent return their souls to the Three Clarities.
The po receives refinement; in the Southern Palace, the form is transformed.
Today is most auspicious; all attain illumination.
The Five Emperors witness and reflect, universally proclaiming to the myriad spirits.
Heavenly gods and earthly deities, all river sources,
The Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, all renowned mountains,
The Caverns of Mystery, the Caverns of Emptiness, the Caverns of Void, the Caverns of Immortals,
The Great Saints of the Boundless, the Perfected and Venerable Divinities—
Limitless and infinite, universally behold and deliver life.
The roots of earth are severed; names are recorded in the Mysterious Capital.
All Perfected respond universally; all things heed."

The High Priest recites directly.

The officials of the Fire Marsh complete their refinement and emerge from the Fire Marsh, proceeding to the Water Pool to receive further refinement. As decreed by the Purple Sovereign, Mysterious Heavenly Emperor.

*Sound the chime, raise the invocation:*
**Yellow Flower, Transfiguring Heavenly Worthy—**
The High Priest summons the officials and generals of the Water Refinement:
With reverence, we call upon the Eastern Well of the Celestial River, the Great Divine of the Jade Eye and Yellow Flower, the Perfected of Refinement, the Envoys of the Water Pool, the Lads of the Water Pool, the Divine Clerks of the Water Palace, Marshal Biyuan of Loyalty and Filial Piety of the Thunder Gate’s Yin Thunder, and all officials, generals, clerks, and soldiers of the Purple Sovereign’s Refinement—
Lead the guiding envoys of souls, escort the departed spirits into the Water Pool for refinement. Ensure their karmic grime is purged like melting ice, their grievances and defilements cleansed as if washed away. Gather their spirits in the Great Yin, reborn in human form.

As commanded by the talisman of the Purple Sovereign, Mysterious Heavenly Emperor, swiftly obey.

*The attendant officers burn the Water Refinement Talisman in the Water Pool.*
*All recite the Middle Chapter.*
The High Priest silently intones:

**Lord of the Northern Quarter, Essence of the Black Emperor,**
Messenger of the Star of the Morning, Generals Ren and Gui.
The Yin Spirits of the Dark Warrior, their voices solemn and clear.
The Five Phases engender transformation; the myriad things arise.
By the Emperor’s decree, the messengers must heed:
Summon the departed souls, bathe and refine their forms.

The High Priest exhales through the nose, transforming breath into water, and blows it into the *tizi* pattern with the left hand.
Envision the Water Pool: true water vast and boundless.
*All recite:*
The Eastern Well and Yellow Flower, essence of the Stone King.
The Flying Dark Water Mother, her body golden, her fluids jade.
Flowing endlessly, an inexhaustible pool.
Nine Dragons pour forth their streams; the Three Luminaries bestow their essence.
Immortal beings exhale their moisture, refining the departed souls.
Within and without, radiant and clear; surface and interior, both purified.
The hundred joints and nine orifices are nourished by primordial qi.
The five viscera and six bowels give rise to the myriad spirits.
The knots of the womb and embryo dissolve like water unlocking its gates.
The roots of death are severed; the roots of evil sink into oblivion.
Now we refine and transform: the dead husk becomes a living soul.
Return to the former state, alter the countenance—
A jade body, a golden visage.
Transformed, the filth is swept away; soaring, they ascend to the Purple Court.

Envision the departed souls in the Water Pool, receiving refinement.
*All recite:*
The Purple Tenuous Yellow Writ, named the Great Mystery.
It brings the water of moonlight to nurture the *po* and harmonize the *hun*.
Within the body, cultivate simplicity; from the body, the Mysterious Pass emerges.
Hidden in heaven, concealed in earth—
The Five Numinous Ladies, nine beams of flying light,
illuminate the Muddy Pellet.
Yellow qi and Yin blossoms, Yang essence refines the immortal.
Bathe the nine souls, crown them in the Golden Dawn.
Radiant and resplendent, proclaim the Jade Embryo’s refinement into immortality.
Interwoven brilliance flows like fragrant rapids.
The Nine Yangs transform in unison; the Mysterious Harmony descends in streams.
The Primordial Scenery lingers, curving to descend into my body.
Soaring to the Upper Palace, gazing upon the jeweled pavilion.

The High Priest inscribes the Jade Writ, exhaling the Azure Qi of the Central Heaven to spread over the departed souls.
*He further intones:*
In the vastness of the Dragon Han, formless and nameless,
Across boundless kalpas, the Yellow Dao shines forth.
Spirits are serene and luminous; the nine souls exhale their essence.
The Jade Void gleams with clarity; the Great Radiance stands in splendor.
The Primordial Beginning initiates transformation; all heavens unite as one.
The Dao-qi of the Three Origins, the Two Images embrace life.
Those already delivered deliver others; the unformed are formed.
The dead are revived; the withered flourish anew.
All crawling and wriggling beings, all hidden spirits,
Those with child and those with child yet unborn—all attain long life.
The departed whose fate is spent return their souls to the Three Clarities.
The *po* receives refinement; in the Southern Palace, the form is transformed.
Today is most auspicious; all attain illumination.
The Five Emperors witness and reflect, universally proclaiming to the myriad spirits.
Heavenly gods and earthly deities, all river sources,
The Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, all renowned mountains,
The Caverns of Mystery, the Caverns of Emptiness, the Caverns of Void, the Caverns of Immortals,
The Great Saints of the Boundless, the Perfected and Venerable Divinities—
Limitless and infinite, universally behold and deliver life.
The roots of earth are severed; names are recorded in the Mysterious Capital.
All Perfected respond universally; all things heed.

The High Priest recites directly.

The officials of the Water Pool, having completed the refinement and deliverance, now lead the departed souls forth from the Water Pool, awaiting their transformation and rebirth, in accordance with the decrees of the Purple Sovereign, the Mysterious Heavenly Emperor.

*Responding to the sounding of the qing bell:*
The Most High Venerable Lord of Refinement and Rebirth

The High Priest recites directly.

Of human birth, there is that which coalesces into form.
The Dao of Heaven creates man; the Dao of Earth creates woman.
The Divine Lords bestow destiny; the Great One holds the talisman.
The Director of Fates determines the allotted span; the Great One delivers the talisman.
The Five Emperors oversee life; the Nine Heavens rejoice in celebration.
The Director of Fates reverently assents and obeys; the myriad spirits sing in harmony.

Revering the divine decrees of Heaven and Earth, the Three Realms stand guard in full array.
Only through such transformation and coalescence can a person be formed.

Today, within this altar, the departed soul of so-and-so, whose fate has run its course,
once returned to the gate of the Yellow Springs, qi scattered and spirit wandered, body perished and form vanished.
Fortunately, the one spirit remains undying, the original true nature yet unsevered.
Through transformation and rebirth, the Most High possesses the method:
The Twelve Qi of the Primordial Chaos can generate the twelve meridians,
returning to the human Dao, governed by the Highest Lord of the Divine Empyrean,
the Jade Clarity of the Primordial Unity, the Six Yang of the Primordial Chaos,
and the Twelve Qi Generative Great Generals.

Now, in accordance with the Purple Sovereign, the Mysterious Heavenly Emperor,
we perform the talismanic rites of refinement and deliverance.
We invoke the descent of the Most High’s Orthodox True Qi of Life,
the Nine Heavens’ Qi of Divine Generation,
to blend with the original spirit and orthodox qi of the departed,
commanding the generals and officials to transform and regenerate according to the method.

The *Lingbao Natural Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Divine Generation*—
the assembly, with utmost reverence, recites in unison, voices harmonized, tones drawn out.

The two assistants, each holding the Water and Fire Banners,
lead the assembly in chanting the *Divine Generation Chapters*,
circling in alternating directions to perform the intersecting refinement rites.

The attendants burn the talismans for generating the kidneys and bladder.

The High Priest recites silently:
The Kidney Spirit, the Mysterious True Lord, styled Yu Ying, overseer,
and Yang Wenguang, the General of the Primordial Qi of Unity.
The Bladder Spirit, the Supreme Void Lord, styled Transmitter, overseer,
and Zhang Tong, the General of the Six Qi of the Primordial Chaos.

Visualize the midnight celestial qi of the Northern Water within the Zi character,
swallowed into the cinnabar field, blending with the qi of the kidneys and bladder.
*Black, black*—one qi, six repetitions, blown upon the departed soul,

beneath which sits a youth at the Jade Barrier.

clad in white rosy clouds, a halo crowning its neck,
the spirit radiating auspicious light,
descending to suffuse the entire form,
dispersing into the nine orifices, gathering at the tongue’s tip, then blown forth.

All recite:

Feasting with the Five Emperors, the Nine Lords of Sun and Moon,

Today is most auspicious—all attain radiance.

and all renowned mountains.
Caverns of Mystery, Caverns of Void,
Caverns of Emptiness, Caverns of Immortals—

the Most Perfect Revered Divinities.
Without end or limit, they universally witness and deliver life.
Earth’s roots are severed, names recorded in the Dark Capital.
The True Universal Response—all comply and heed.

The High Master intones directly:
Reverently offering true incense, we humbly present this petition once more
to the Three Clarities, the Three Treasures, the Supreme Emperor,
the Five Numinous Ones, the Five Venerable Lords,
and the Lord of Soul-Gathering of the Five Bureaus of Childhood’s Beginning.
We pray that the true *qi* of the five directions descend again,
the *qi* of the three hues of primordial chaos,
to pour into the departed soul,
that the *qi* of the Nine Heavens may quicken its spirit,
and the true essence of the Three Origins preserve its fate.
Yellow and white arrive in full,
inner and outer unite in form.
The Six Jia circulate, the Five Phases interact,
modeling heaven and earth,
embracing yin and nurturing yang,
uniting with the Dao to achieve perfection—
thus exalted and noble.
The head becomes Kunlun,
hair the stars,
eyebrows the canopied parasol,
eyes the sun and moon,
nose the Pillar of Heaven,
ears the Heavenly Windows,
mouth the Heavenly Gate,
face the Heavenly Mirror.
The *qi* of the First Origin becomes the true spirit,
the *qi* of the Second Origin becomes luminous essence,
the *qi* of the Third Origin becomes the Three Palaces,
the *qi* of the four seasons becomes the Four Passes,
the *qi* of the Five Phases becomes the Five Viscera,
the *qi* of the Six Pitches becomes the Six Bowels,
the *qi* of the Seven Stars becomes the Seven Orifices,
the *qi* of the Eight Winds becomes the Eight Limits,
the *qi* of the Nine Heavens becomes the Nine Palaces.
Outer *qi* aligns with inner *qi*,
inner spirits align with outer spirits.
Spirit-father and spirit-mother,
harmonizing with the primordial spirit,
primordial *qi* mutually engendering,
the Five Phases gathering to refine.
We must thank the Primordial Revered One,
whose assent fulfills our earnest prayers.

The chime sounds—
Five Spirits Blending with Heaven Honored One.

All recite.

A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions,
naturally forming the true;
when the myriad *qi* align, all ascend as immortals.

The High Priest performs the rites of the Five Palaces,
silently circulating the *qi* of the Capital of Merit:
—*gongdu* completes at *mao*,
the Horn’s edge stabilizes at *wu*,
life flourishes and turns at *you*,
the Lone Standard shifts at *zi*.
*Kehan* illumines the jade—
the Capital of Merit gathers souls and draws in the *qi* of *xun*,
releasing the mudra to array the departed spirits.

Red apricots held in rank at *zhen*,
ink-black swiftness at *bai*.
At *kan*, the true plan grinds with force;
at *dui*, socks and wax gather the harvest.
At *li*, the Numinous Treasure pervades all things;
the jade *qi* harmonizes and unites.
The jade Orthodox Unity perfects the Dharma,
wisdom increases and truth is attained—
summon the courier to descend and seize.

The left three fingers grasp the middle joint of the thumb,
the *qi* of the Central Heaven releases the mudra,
arraying the departed spirits:
the Azure Emperor guards the hun at *mao*,
the White Emperor attends the po at *you*;
the Vermilion Emperor nurtures *qi* at *wu*,
the Black Emperor circulates blood at *zi*;
the Yellow Emperor presides at the center—
the myriad spirits do not transgress.

The High Priest clasps the mudra of the Five Peaks,
drawing the *qi* of the Five Directions,
releasing the mudra to array the departed spirits:
what was withered revives,
what was extinguished is reborn.
Attaining birth in the heavens,
they receive anew the great numen.
Through the kalpas of the Nine Heavens,
they return to the womb and become infants again.
Impure *qi* is swept away,
the body’s corpse is renewed.

All recite:
*Liberating Grievances, Unbinding Knots Heaven Honored One.*

The acolytes burn the talisman for releasing grievances.
The High Priest silently recites the *Qinghua Invocation* once, silently invoking
the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering,
the August Emperor of the Purple Empyrean,
entreating them to release the departed spirits from grievances and untie their knots,
from the three lifetimes and four debts,
that creditors and adversaries may no longer obstruct.
The jade mudra and azure *qi* array the departed spirits,
as the silent incantation and divine talisman descend—
grievances unbound, knots released.
Forever freed from enmity,
distinctions of contention dissolved.
All causes of strife extinguished,
no evil karma arises.
Emerging from the cold courts of judgment,
the roots of transgression vanish.
The departed spirit regains wholeness of body,
this is called death and yet rebirth;
robes and headdress restored,
one awakens to the truth of coming but not returning.
Not with the garments of the mortal realm are they offered,
but with reverent talismans and incantations,
assisting the transformation of the body’s vestments,
ascending to the lofty shores of the Dao.

All recite:
*Heavenly Worthy of Golden Countenance and Jade Form.*

The acolytes burn the talisman for robes.
All chant the *Jade Invocation* three times.
The High Priest silently recites:
Crimson script and cinnabar robes,
fluttering in graceful elegance.
The primordial talismanic command,
when worn, grants effortless ascent.
*Oṃ vajri* □, swiftly as the Fire Emperor of the Southern Cinnabar Heaven obeys the law.

The acolytes burn the talisman for headdress and sash.
The High Priest arrays the departed spirits with the jade script and *qi* of the Central Heaven,
envisioning them in resplendent robes and headdress,
awaiting the transmission of precepts.

At the sounding of the chime:
*Heavenly Worthy Who Perpetually Transmits the True Precepts.*

The Dao speaks: "Precepts are restraint." They restrain the human mind from wrongdoing, guiding it to true stillness—thus precepts give rise to stillness. The Confucians also say, "Knowing restraint, one attains stillness." Yet among the Three Caverns' scriptures and the Four Divisions' secret texts, the methods of precepts vary widely. Only the sublime and wondrous Nine True Precepts of the Supreme Numinous Treasure command the reverence of heaven and humanity, observed alike by the hidden and the manifest. Supreme above all that is supreme, profound beyond all that is profound, numinous among the ten thousand spirits, precious as the singular *qi*—their marvel pervades the Three Realms, their precepts govern the Six Passions. Their number is fixed by yang, hence divided into nine; cultivated without falsity, they are called "true." The world looks up to them as its fortress; the hidden and manifest rely on them as their bridge; souls receive them as their healing medicine.

The method of receiving precepts begins with stillness and silence; the practice of upholding them demands utmost diligence. The assembly bows in reverence, joining in sincere praise.

At the sounding of the chime:
*Let each in the assembly respond with reverence.*

The Three Refuges are refuge in the Dao, refuge in the scriptures, and refuge in the masters. Therefore, all souls must believe and pay homage.

First, take refuge in the Supreme Treasure of the Dao:
*Heavenly Worthy of the Treasure of the Dao.*

Second, take refuge in the Supreme Treasure of the Scriptures:
*Heavenly Worthy of the Treasure of the Scriptures.*

Third, take refuge in the Supreme Treasure of the Masters:
*Heavenly Worthy of the Treasure of the Masters.*

With the Refuges complete, the transmission of precepts begins. The dark netherworld brightens like spring’s return; karmic debts dissolve forever. The flowers of sin wither; merit and fruition come to perfect fulfillment. The assembly, with utmost devotion, proclaims the Nine Precepts:

The First Precept: Be diligent and loyal to the sovereign.
The Second Precept: Honor and humbly serve your parents.
The Third Precept: Do not kill; show compassion to all beings.
The Fourth Precept: Do not commit sexual misconduct; maintain purity in body and conduct.
The Fifth Precept: Do not steal; practice righteousness and self-restraint.
The Sixth Precept: Do not harbor anger or bully others.
The Seventh Precept: Do not deceive or harm the virtuous.
The Eighth Precept: Do not be arrogant or neglect the true.
The Ninth Precept: Do not waver; uphold the precepts with single-minded devotion.

These Nine Precepts were personally proclaimed by the Nine Heavenly Lords. Those who wear and honor them ascend to the Nine Heavens; those who slight them fall into the Nine Hells. Today, in accordance with the rites, they are transmitted to the departed souls. Listen carefully and never forget from beginning to end.

All talismans of merit are displayed one by one:
The *Announcer* presents the *Talisman of Longevity* and the *Register of Ascension to Heaven*.
The wondrous precepts and numinous texts, the Yellow Register and White Tablet, having been set forth in the sacred scriptures, are now reverently offered to the spirits.

The heart is hard to govern—thus the Nine Precepts return it to the Great Void. The form has not yet transcended—thus the two talismans refine it in the celestial realms. Departed souls, never forget these precepts in any lifetime; keep these talismans close through every kalpa. With spirit settled beyond the material world, the dusty bonds of many lives are forever severed. Reborn in the yang realm, the fruits of goodness naturally ripen in wondrous being. Your virtue shines in the present, bringing boundless blessings. Soon, the souls will be dispatched, protected and guided to ascend as immortals.

The High Priest dispatches the generals:
*[Such-and-such] Office respectfully summons the Nine Heavens’ Universal Salvation Court, the Two Great Generals Guarding the Male and Embracing the Female, the principal and deputy generals of this altar, the Four Great Marshals protecting the Dao and overseeing the altar—hasten to escort the departed soul of [Name] directly to the Vermilion Numinous Fire Palace and the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace. By the Emperor’s decree, wind and fire shall not delay.*

All recite:
*Heavenly Worthy of Perfect Flowering Completion.*

Departed souls, you now soar toward the Southern Culmen, leaving the darkness of the Northern Feng. Having paid homage to the Dao, the scriptures, and the masters, the sun of singular truth shines bright. Refining form, spirit, and *qi*, the winds of ten thousand illusions are stilled. You ascend to the vast and boundless realm, reaching the realm of emptiness and non-being. Forever freed from the wheel of rebirth, you abide in effortless freedom. Depart now from this feast; do not forget the grace of the Dao.

At the sounding of the voice:
*Heavenly Worthy Who Transcends the Immortal Realms.*

The High Priest summons Marshal Wen to dispatch the protective escort writ. Having offered thanks, he descends from the dais, and the ascension rites are complete. The High Priest returns to the altar, and the Precentor intones:

*Abide in spirit and offer incense.*

The High Priest recites:
Incense Officials and Envoys, Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all attendant spirit-officials of the incense—may this place where I have just ascended the altar to refine and deliver the departed naturally give rise to golden liquid elixirs, azure mushroom essences, and a hundred numinous perfected beings, all gathered here before this incense burner and brazier.

May this ritual altar, dedicated to the deliverance of all souls, dissolve all obstructions and lingering attachments. May their forms be refined to purity, their natures perceived with perfect clarity, their true essence of water and fire wondrously congealed, and the realms of humans and heavens be transformed and regenerated.

May the profound grace extend widely, and the blessings of goodness be equally shared. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions, bearing orchid incense, swiftly convey the sincerity of my supplication to the presence of the Supreme Perfect Three Treasures, the Patriarchal Master, and the August Sovereign of the Dark Heaven and Purple Emperor.

The Purple Emperor’s Rites of Refining and Deliverance are now complete.
