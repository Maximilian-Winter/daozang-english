---

At that time, the Supreme Venerable Sovereign was in the Eight Radiant Heavens of the Great Brahma Heaven, where he summoned the myriad perfected immortals of the ten directions and three realms, along with an innumerable host of sages, to expound the wondrous and most true Dharma for delivering beings without limit.

From the assembly, a perfected one named Deliverer from Suffering stepped forward, holding a tablet and kneeling reverently. He addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "I have heard that in the high antiquity, people seldom fell ill and lived for a thousand years. Yet in this present age, multitudes suffer calamities, their years cut short. What is the cause of this? I humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage, to expound the reason for the assembly, that we may hear the supreme Dao."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "You, Deliverer from Suffering, have asked on behalf of sentient beings about this cause. I shall now explain it to you—listen carefully.

In high antiquity, people revered the great Dao and cultivated the root of their nature. They did not kill or harm, neither envied nor resented, neither desired nor coveted, neither indulged in lust nor stole. Their words were free of deceit, their speech void of malice. They made no distinctions between self and others, nor contended with things. Their natures were pure and simple, their forms and essences firmly preserved. Thus, they knew no disasters, and their lifespans extended, reaching a hundred, a thousand, or even more years.

In recent ages, beings have shown no reverence for Heaven and Earth, nor awe for the divine. Their hearts breed envy, their minds give rise to greed and wrath. They kill and harm life, benefit themselves at others’ expense. They use large measures for taking and small for giving, deceiving the ignorant. Their mouths spew slander and double-tongued words, adorned with false and deceptive speech. They bully the weak with their strength, oppress the poor with their wealth. They defile the good and harm the virtuous. With a thousand transgressions and ten thousand faults, retribution swiftly follows.

Thus, Heaven dispatches the Five Pestilence Envoys and the officers and soldiers of disease to descend with calamities, scattering afflictions. Some suffer wind-stroke, some cold damage, some epidemics, some diarrhea, some dysentery, some fiery eyes, some malignant sores—all manner of illnesses. Their minds grow confused, their bodies restless. They lie bedridden, seeking remedies in vain. The mild recover in ten days; the severe may languish for months. When transgressions accumulate beyond measure, they endure year after year, their illnesses lingering without cure, until they perish. Those not yet fifty, in the prime of life, meet untimely deaths—all due to the causes of unwholesomeness, leading to such outcomes."

The perfected one again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "You have opened your compassion to enlighten the ignorant. Yet the beings of this desire realm, unaware of prohibitions, commit offenses and cannot escape the net of law. When calamities descend, or even when they meet with demonic deaths, by what means may they be saved? I humbly implore the Heavenly Worthy, in your great mercy, to bestow the virtue of cherishing life, to widely open the gate of salvation, and to take pity on the benighted, sparing them from disasters."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy further instructed the perfected one: "These calamities cannot be saved without medicine, nor cured without healing. In ancient times, there was a divine physician of Qin, renowned as the state’s healer. He thoroughly understood medicine and deeply grasped the principles of the pulse. Known as the Divine Responding King Bian Que, he accumulated boundless merit through his service to the spirits. By imperial decree, he was enfeoffed as the Numinous Responding Medicine King.

This true lord’s profound silence penetrates Heaven and Earth; his wondrous efficacy moves ghosts and spirits. He universally saves the multitudes, his name known throughout the world. He possesses the *True Scripture for Saving from Eighty-One Calamities*, which should be transmitted to the world. Those who circulate, read, and recite it may avoid afflictions.

If there are good men and believing women who request this true scripture, sincerely enshrine it, and reverently make offerings, they shall forever remain free from disasters and suffer few illnesses in their lifetimes. Should they encounter a day of calamity, they may establish a ritual arena in a quiet place, purify and prepare incense, flowers, lamps, and candles, and invite Daoist priests—or recite the *Scripture for Saving from Calamities* themselves—three, five, or even dozens or hundreds of times. Thereby, they will move the Numinous Responding True Lord to silently bestow divine elixirs and wondrous medicines. In dreams, they may receive acupuncture and moxibustion treatments, and their illnesses will vanish, their misfortunes be washed away. Their bodies will become light and healthy, their forms restored to normal. For all who suffer calamities, they should urgently burn incense and recite the scripture, and peace will come within days."
