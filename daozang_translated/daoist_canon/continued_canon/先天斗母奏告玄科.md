**Precelestial Dipper Mother’s Memorial to the Mysterious Rites**

The ritual begins. The Pace of Yu is invoked. The master traces the Nine Phoenix Talismans, flies the incantatory hand seals over the water vessel, and burns the Nine Phoenix Talismans.

I have heard that when the whale’s waves enter the sacred, they dispel the dust of the Five Turbidities; when the phoenix’s script transcends the mundane, it may summon the qi of the Nine Heavens. As the Li fire first ignites, the earthly realm is already purified. Today, I burn incense to summon the Nine Phoenix Generals for Breaking Defilement, the Five Emperors and Five Dragon Lords of the Five Directions, the Lords of Heavenly Virtue and Lunar Virtue, the Mighty Divine Spirits of the Qi of Life and the Qi of Flourishing, the Officers and Soldiers of the Cavernous Talismans and Great Mystery, the Lady of the Flowery Pond for Scriptural Ablutions, the Azure-Water Embroidered-Robe Envoys, and all the officials, generals, officers, and soldiers of the Bureau for Dispelling Malevolence and the Office for Purification. I beseech each to wield their talismans, swords, and staves, descending to infuse my water with true qi, sweeping away defilement this very moment. May a thousand evils retreat without trace, ten thousand perversities vanish without shadow. May they move heaven and earth, stir gods and ghosts. By this power of cleansing and purification, may thunder roar and winds rain, establishing this realm of clarity and stillness. With focused intent, I invoke their awe-inspiring transformations. The scriptures and secret incantations are now solemnly proclaimed.

The assembly recites the *Purification of Heaven and Earth Mantra* and the *Talisman for Purifying the Altar*. The master silently intones the incantation to transform the altar.

I solemnly command: Let the altar embody the Eight Trigrams, concealing within the revolving jade pivot. Let the Twenty-Eight Constellations be arrayed across the four directions. First, seal the demonic paths; next, leave open the human gate. Above, open the gate of heaven; below, close the door of earth. May malevolence be eradicated, and the Dao’s qi ascend and spread—all in accordance with the primordial decrees.

The talisman of sincerity is burned. As the jade censer gathers the numinous winds, the curling smoke expresses reverent devotion. The precious characters form flying clouds and talismanic script, conveying the sincerity of this memorial. The work of the heart-ground, the profound transformations of nature—today, I respectfully offer the true talisman into the incense burner. Illuminating the Dao and virtue, uniting the unfathomable yin and yang, what is preserved becomes spirit, what passes is transformed. At the sight of a single wisp of smoke, its might resounds and its numen soars. Already bathed in the assembly of the ten thousand spirits, the celestial winds scatter their traces, the stellar fires are heard from afar. Following the true canon, I now intone the secret incantation.

The master performs the Three Bows and offers incense. The assembly recites the *Incense Mantra*:

Jade radiance scatters its splendor,
Nine qi congeal in the smoke.
The fragrant clouds weave densely,
Piercing straight to the Nine Heavens.
The Golden Lad attendant of incense,
The Jade Maiden transmitter of words—
For this servant, they convey the memorial,
Heard before the Celestial Emperor.
All prayers and vows,
Are granted as spoken.

The master performs the Three Bows, kneels to invoke the master, and burns the talisman.

Prostrate, I consider: when the Dipper stands in solemn majesty, the sincerity of this memorial—where goodness is master—relies entirely on the master’s guiding power. Without a master, none cross over; only the Dao is followed. Here below, I present my petition.

The appointed heir and orphaned disciple [Name] reverently burns incense of faith and devoutly memorializes the Three Treasures of Dao, Scriptures, and Master; the Primordial Beginning and the Ten Thousand Spirits; the Supreme Perfected; the Three Realms’ Primordial Lords; the Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal of the Vast Heaven; the Celestial Father and Heavenly Emperor, Lord of the Dharma of the Brahma-Qi Heavenly Sovereign; the Celestial Mother of the Brahma-Qi Heavenly Sovereign; the Heavenly Emperor, Father of the Dipper; the Heavenly Lord of the Dragon Han Era; the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity at the Center of Heaven’s North Pole; the Great Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign of the Star Palace of Gouchen; the August Thearch of the Earth, the Queen of the Sacred Soil Who Bears the Law of Heaven; the Perfected King of Divine Empyrean and Great Emperor of Longevity; the Great Emperor of the Eastern Culmen and Azure Brilliance; the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation Through the Thunderous Voice of the Nine Heavens’ Response; the Great Emperor, Ancestor of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder; the Dipper Mother, Heavenly Empress of Purple Radiance; the Great Sage of the Mālaya Heaven, Heavenly Worthy of the Dao Mother of Perfect Illumination; the Great Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Clarity’s Purple Tenuity and Azure Jade Palace; the Great Emperor of the Six Heavens’ Abyssal Caverns; the Lord Emperor of the Six Waves of Heaven; the Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Controller of the Han; the Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Inspector; the Heavenly Emperors of the Myriad Heavens; the Lofty Perfected Who Preside Over the Dharma; the True Lords of the Ten Poles and Ten Floras; the Divine Immortals of the *Scriptures and Registers of the Jeweled Chapters and Precious Repositories*; the Eleven Great Stellar Lords of the Supreme Clarity; the Six Stellar Lords of the Southern Dipper Who Extend Longevity; the Nine August Lords of the Northern Dipper Who Dispel Calamities; the Three Stellar Lords of the Eastern, Western, and Central Dippers; the Myriad Stellar Forms and Hosts of Perfected Beings of the Entire Heavens; the Great Sage of the Celestial Stem and Stellar Lord of Astral Brilliance; the Stellar Lord of My Inborn Destiny in This Life; the Divine Immortals and Myriad Divine Officials Within the Dipper; the Three Great Emperors of the Three Origins and Three Grades; the Perfected Lords of the Northern Culmen, the Celestial Stalwart, and the Celestial Guardian Who Assists the Sage; the Perfected Lord of the Northern Culmen’s Protection and the Sage, the Great Emperor of the Dark Heaven; the Ancestral Master, Supreme Mystery’s Prime Minister, and Perfected Lord of the Orthodox Unity; the Immortal Elder of the Left Palace of the Supreme Ultimate; the Perfected Lord, Master of the True Purity and Bright Dao; the Three Perfected Lords, Ancestral Masters of the Canopy; the Three Mao Lords of the Supreme Clarity Who Govern Life; the Ancestral Master, Fire Master Wang the Perfected Lord; the Perfected Lord, King of Numinous Kindness; the Ancestral Master, Zhang the Perfected Lord of Empty Tranquility; the Ancestral Master, the Realized Man Who Converted the Western Barbarians; the Ancestral Master, the Realized Man Agni; the Ancestral Master, the Iron Ox Sage; the Ancestral Master, the Chan Master Yixing; the Ancestral Master, the Realized Man of Universal Brilliance, Academician of the Hanlin; the Ancestral Master, the White Realized Man of the Purple Clarity and Bright Dao; the Lineage Master, the Lazy Ox Master; the Lineage Master, the Demon-Quelling Female Immortal Master; the Lineage Master, the Great Dharma Master of Pure Far-Reaching Proclamation of the Yuan Reception; the Lineage Master, the Great Dharma Master of Responsive Brilliance; the Great Dharma Master of Kind Brilliance; the Perfected Man of the Upper Officials of Western Shu; the Perfected Man of the Supreme Ultimate’s Thunderous Transcendence; the Perfected Man Zhong of Guozhou, Mighty and Kind; the Perfected Man Liu of the Illuminating Response of the Utmost Tranquility and Perfect Virtue; the Perfected Man Shi of the Iron Mountain of the Flowery Pearl; the Perfected Man Mo of the Moon Tripod, Scattered Officer of Divine Empyrean; the Three Perfected Masters of the Scriptural Preceptors; the Hosts of Immortals Who Transmit and Receive the Orthodox Unity of the Pure Subtlety, Numinous Treasure, and Moral Dao—

I envision the phoenix chariots and crane carriages alighting gracefully upon the altar, the dragon cakes and phoenix teas presented reverently upon the tables. The master’s radiance descends; pure tea is offered.

Scattering flowers, the master performs the Three Bows, offers incense, and kneels again.

The appointed heir and descendant of the Mysterious Lineage, the humble disciple [Name], kowtows and bows twice to memorialize:

Prostrate, I pray: may the master’s robes billow like the Dipper’s handle, arriving from the Central Heaven to halt his steps. The brewed tea expresses my mortal sincerity, fulfilling a disciple’s reverence for the master. May the master’s seat be briefly settled, silently aiding the ritual procedures.

Prostrate, I reflect: this disciple’s nature is coarse and unworthy, born of the Brahma Palace’s lineage. In ascending lead and descending mercury, I know not the methods of cultivation; in ascending the purple and scaling the clear, I fathom not the principles of memorializing. Relying on the master’s secret guidance, I am thus able to exhaustively proclaim the ritual procedures. Having received the master’s words, I dare not delay in unfolding them.

I humbly memorialize: regarding the intentions and heartfelt sincerity brought forth, I reverently disclose them. I vow to firmly pursue salvation and beneficence, for the matter pertains to cherishing life. This heart’s sincerity brooks no refusal. I respectfully present the Heart Chapter to the Dipper Mother, to be heard in the Great Brahma Heavenly Palace. The memorial and documents are prepared for the Dipper’s府; all must be memorialized according to the Dharma.

My heartfelt words are revealed; may they reach the lofty and wise. Prostrate, I pray: may boundless compassion be bestowed, and step-by-step guidance be granted. In seeking and responding, may I be corrected by those who possess the Dao. Whatever is prayed for, may it be fulfilled through utmost sincerity.

I earnestly await the master’s decree, to be transmitted to the master’s abode. May the talismanic commands be proclaimed, and my sincere words be made manifest. Humbly awaiting your gracious favor, I dare not presume to express my gratitude. Temporarily stationed at the altar, I preside over the memorial. When the ritual is complete, I will uphold my foolish sincerity to see the master off.

Recite: *The Heavenly Worthy of the Luminous Essential Decree*.

Perform the Three Bows, recite the *Mantra of Golden Light*, the master transforms into a deity, paces the asterisms, and summons the generals.

Heaven and Earth are vast, thus they cherish all things without neglect. The sun and moon are lofty and bright, thus they surely illuminate even the smallest glimmer. Though the cloudy passes are distant, the Heavenly Ears hear from afar. Today, at the Thunder Bureau, I burn incense to summon the talismanic envoys of the Three Realms, the Four Directly Serving Merit Officers, the Earth Gods of the Altar’s Precincts, and the Responsive Spirits. Hear this summons and hasten to the altar to receive instructions.

Swiftly! Secretly recite the mantra: *In the profound and obscure, Heaven and Earth are born together. Scattered, they become qi; gathered, they take form. At a call, they arrive; at a summons, they attend. To disobey my command is to rebel against the Supreme Clarity. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*

Having just issued the summons, I imagine they have already arrived at the altar. I humbly trouble them to carry my incense and ascend to summon: the Yang Spirit of the Nine Heavens’ Command, the Swift Fire Decree Lord Deng; the Yin Thunder Marshal of the Nine Heavens’ Command, the Mighty Officer Lord Xin; the Stellar Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Commanding Stem, the Swift and Responsive Messenger Zhang; the Great Thunder King of the Jade Sound and Brahma Tone; the Myriad Thunder Gods of Proclamation and Transformation; and all the officials, generals, and soldiers of this altar. Hear this summons and hasten to the altar. I reverently request that you array your solemn majesty, marshal your ranks, and receive this purified altar’s talismanic command. Guard the altar’s precincts, manifesting in awe-inspiring radiance to universally sweep away all pernicious influences. Solemnly welcome the Dipper’s Perfected to descend and witness, enabling my heartfelt words to be silently conveyed. Reveal good and ill fortune, and manifest the Dao’s transformations. Each must attend to your duties; none may neglect your posts. Greatly manifest retribution, and act in accordance with the decrees.

The altar talisman is transformed as all recite the incantation:
The jade altar stands towering,
soaring high into the Great Tenuity.
Golden-armored iron cavalry,
a hundred million myriad encircling.
Sweep away demonic vapors,
exterminate all evil and wrong.
Purify the cloud-paths,
descend to the celestial steps.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees!

Proclamation of the Two Brahma Talismans:
May our hearts soar beyond the realm of forms to reverently welcome the descent of the Nine Heavens’ chariot. May our gaze be drawn to the sagely ones within the Dipper, our necks leaning upon the messengers to drive their conveyance. Now, as this true talisman is issued, we supplicate the Dipper’s Jade Brahma Honored Heavenly Louluo King, the Wondrous Brahma Honored Heavenly Qieluo King, the Great Brahma Heavenly Palace Direct Talisman Attendant Lin, the Yang Bearer Attendant, the Dhāraṇī Attendant Geng, the Dipper’s Intermediary Steward, the Dipper’s Seven Primes Divine Generals of Life-Prolonging, Longevity-Bestowing, Decline-Supporting, Calamity-Averting, Disaster-Dispersing, Misfortune-Dissolving, and Destiny-Enhancing, the Nine Heavens Flying Swift Response Messenger Zhang Divine Lord, the Dipper’s Karmic Knot-Unraveling and Grievance-Resolving Special Envoy Yin Yuan Master of the Earth Bureau’s Grand Year, the Dipper’s Twenty-Four Calamities-Resolving Numinous Officials, the Seven Primes True Lamps Life-Destiny Divining Divine Clerks, the Eight Gates Vigilant Response Great Gods, the Dipper Mansion’s Dark Ministry Ranked Officials, the Ritual Register’s Transcendent Numinous Officials and Clerks, this altar’s assisting divine soldiers, the deities of this locale’s city god temples and earth-altars, the household incense-and-fire Controller of Destiny and Earth Gods, the talisman-wielders of the Three Realms, the Four Duty Functionaries, and all gods attending the altar to fulfill their duties and respond in reverence.

We look up, awaiting their manifestation in accordance with the talisman, their numinous efficacy activated by decree, descending to the dharma altar to faithfully transmit our sincere entreaties.

Invocation:
Responding to the moment, hasten to the perception, Heavenly Worthy.

The master silently intones:

Oṃ li dong, tsa li hūṃ. Oṃ lang □ nie □.

Now issuing the Primordial Descending True Talisman, we reverently invoke:
The Jade Brahma Venerable Heavenly Lóluó King,
The Wondrous Brahma Venerable Heavenly Qiéluó King,
The Great Brahma Heavenly Palace Direct Talisman Forest Messenger,
The Dipper’s Yang-Bearing Goat Attendant,
The Dhāraṇī Geng Messenger,
The Dipper’s Communication Attendant,
The Nine Heavens’ Flying Swift Response Messenger, Divine Lord Zhang,
The Dipper Mansion’s Dark Ministry Ranked Officials.

Having bathed in your numinous power and descended, may you deign to heed our humble entreaties.

On this day, for the purpose of prayer and exorcism, so-and-so prostrates beneath your altar, petitioning the Dipper’s Perfected Ones. We humbly beseech your vast compassion to bestow wondrous salvation, sweeping clean the clouded thoroughfares and manifesting the true realm. May our heartfelt pleas be conveyed, ascending to the Dipper Palace, entreating your gracious light to descend in inspection.

As the precious tripod’s incense burns, may it rise to meet the hovering cloud-canopy; as the silver lamps’ floral wicks bloom, may they radiate in splendor with the stellar precincts. Transform darkness into light, purge foul vapors into purity.

We now reverently perform the True Talisman of Illuminating Lamps, the stellar configurations of the Dipper’s handle manifesting fortune and misfortune. May the lush, layered Brahma-qi descend upon five-colored auspicious clouds, may the radiant three-five points of propitious light shift the stars of the entire heavens. May the Dao-qi descend with the incantation, may the true light circulate in accord with the talisman, that our practice may swiftly manifest clear response.

Temporarily pause your celestial adornments, deign to bestow your inspection.

We reverently perform the ritual in accordance with the Dharma.

**Proclaim the Descending Talisman.**

All recite the incantation:
The Seven Primes descend, heeding our petition.
The lamps’ light reveals fortune and misfortune.
By the power of the mighty deities,
may all wishes align with the heart.
In union with the Dao, attaining perfection.

**Invocation:**
Manifesting Wondrous Transformation, Heavenly Worthy.

Visualize in accordance with the secret instructions.

The assembly recites the Lamp-Transforming Incantation:
By the Emperor’s decree,
the Dipper’s lamps are kindled.
The Seven Stars descend,
illuminating all beings.
Left Assistant and Right Guardian,
manifest your numinous power.
Heavenly Marshal Tianpeng,
commands the celestial soldiers.
Heavenly Thunder Messengers,
the Six Jia and Six Ding.
Mysterious Warrior Great Sage,
the Three Terraces Venerable Stars.
Seize illness, dispel misfortune,
reverse death to restore life.
Heaven’s mighty power descends,
slaying and beheading demonic spirits.
Gather the hun-soul, reattach the body,
pacify the seven po.
With one illumination of the Dipper’s lamp,
may body and dwelling shine brightly.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!

**Invocation:**
Universally Illuminating Lamp Light, Heavenly Worthy.

May the lamps’ stellar radiance intermingle with the luminous glow of pearls and jade.
May the Yang-Bearing Goat and Dhāraṇī advance with steps upon the jade stairs.
May the Communication Attendant precede the Brahma Palace’s chariot.

We reverently perform the Primordial Descending Numinous Secret Script, hastening to the Dipper’s mouth. May a single sincerity pierce the Primordial Sovereign, ascending to be heard before the Emperor. May the upright qi flow through the original destiny, silently fulfilling the earnestness of our devotion, coming to heal urgent calamities.

May the cloud paths be purified, celestial processions swiftly traverse the skies; may the heavenly thoroughfares be leveled, rainbow-clad figures descend to the human realm.

Dare we not reverently burn the precious script, focusing our intent upon the jade altar? We beseech your gracious light to condescend in descent.

The master bows thrice and offers incense.

The officiant, so-and-so, prostrates again, thrice revealing the heart’s incense, most reverently and sincerely memorializing:
The Nine Heavens’ Thunder Ancestor Great Emperor,
The Great Brahma Precelestial Qian-Primordial Vast Light Dipper Mother, Purple Radiance Golden Venerable Sacred Virtue Heavenly Queen,
The Luminous Dao Mother Heavenly Worthy,
The Supreme Heavenly Palace of the Great Net Heaven’s Central Heavenly Star Lord,
The Illuminator of Myriad Dharmas, Ancestral Master, Northern Culmen Purple Tenuity Great Emperor,
The Celestial August Emperor of the Gouchen Star Palace,
The Jade Dipper’s Left Palace, Highest Jade August Star Emperor,
The Great Numinous Eightfold Radiance Primordial Lady,
The Jade Dipper’s Right Palace, Northern Culmen Primordial Minister Great Emperor,
The Seven Primes’ Supreme Dao Primordial Lady,
The Purple Culmen Heavenly Hero Greedy Wolf Supreme Star Lord,
The Purple Culmen Heavenly Task Gigantic Gate Primordial Star Lord,
The Purple Culmen Heavenly Pillar Prosperity-Preserving Chaste Star Lord,
The Purple Culmen Heavenly Heart Literary Brilliance Binding Star Lord,
The Purple Culmen Heavenly Quail Upright Chaste Net Star Lord,
The Purple Culmen Heavenly Assistant Military Brilliance Discipline Star Lord,
The Purple Culmen Heavenly Impetus Breaking Army Pass Star Lord,
The Purple Culmen Heavenly Inner Cavern Brightness Outer Assistant Star Lord,
The Purple Culmen Heavenly Hidden Primordial Right Guardian Star Lord,

All the Attendant Illuminators and Presiding Stellar Governors,
The Dipper’s Thousand Perfected, Myriad Sages, Arrayed Luminaries, and Host of Perfected Ones.

We reverently beseech your Dao compassion to condescend in inspection.

We have heard that the ancestral qi wondrously divides, nurturing the people and establishing the ultimate; the earthly origin conceives substance, the myriad sages’ mother supporting heaven. Entrusted with governance through radiant illumination, relying upon the embrace of the myriad phenomena, we now humbly petition, wholly depending upon your responsive grace.

Today, for so-and-so’s petition of exorcism and deliverance, our duty lies in expounding the teachings, our aspiration in aiding others. Having received the petition, it is fitting to present it in memorial.

We reflect that our mortal, foolish, and impure nature has yet to penetrate the true; self-examination often lacks cultivation, the profound principles yet to glimpse the subtle and wondrous. We wholly rely upon the Dao’s power to draw forth and guide the ignorant.

Reverently considering the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Ancestor, the Great Brahma Precelestial Qian-Primordial Vast Light Dipper Mother, the Purple Radiance Golden Venerable Sacred Virtue Heavenly Queen, the Luminous Dao Mother Heavenly Worthy—your Dharma bodies spanning kalpas, golden lotus auspicious forms, transforming across the Three Realms, upholding the precincts of the Two Emperors, nurturing all beings, governing the Seven Primes’ positions. Your radiance precedes the sun and moon, your majestic might subdues thunder and lightning. All who receive yin and yang equally partake of your transformation and nurturance.

Now, for so-and-so, whose body is afflicted by illness and suffering, whose heart yearns for the true lineage, we pray for blessings to dispel calamities, specially establishing the altar to perform the rites. Looking up, we receive your guidance, achieving the propagation of your teachings. Having received this sincere petition, it is impossible to refuse. We vow to diligently benefit and save, reverently performing the memorial and exorcism.

May the incense-attending immortal maidens swiftly reach the boundless and pure realm; may the true numina deign to glance downward, temporarily departing the heavenly palace and Brahma abode to descend.

We, with utmost reverence and awe, kowtow and prostrate again, reverently welcoming the arrival of your sacred presence.

Respectfully stated.

The ritual assembly recites the *Golden Light Mantra*, burns the *Purple Radiance Cloud Talisman*, while the master visualizes the secret instructions within.

With both hands forming the *Dipper Mudra*, first welcoming the left *Dipper Mudra*, they pay homage with the *Brahma Sound*:

*Namo ratna traya ya, tara ṇa—*
*Mālī jīlī tu—*
*Nīng yīng tí wéi yīng nǎ dōng wéi tuó,*
*Pó luō yē lī, pó tuō lī, pó luō ā mù qí sà pó tú sè shì,*
*Pán tuó pán tuó svāhā.*

Then welcoming the right mudra:
*Oṃ hrīḥ, oṃ hrīḥ hrīḥ hrīḥ,*
*Oṃ oṃ hrī, oṃ hrī, oṃ hrī,*
*Hūṃ hūṃ svāhā.*

Returning to the left mudra:
*Oṃ hūṃ traṭ taṭ ya ta,*
*Āḷa gā mó, mó la gā mó,*
*Sū tú mó, zhī pó luō mó,*
*Mó hē pó luó mó, mó lì— mó,*
*Oṃ traṭ yē nǎ— mó,*
*Namo suī dū dì, jí jí fèng Yuánshǐ Shàngdì Pílúzhēnà Dàshèngzhǔ chì.*

Then welcoming the right mudra:
*Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ traṭ lī lī, traṭ lī lī,*
*— yē lī svāhā.*

Returning to the left mudra:
*Oṃ hūṃ traṭ lī, nán— lī,*
*— — lī lǜ lìng svāhā.*

Then welcoming the right mudra:
*Oṃ nǎ— — — lú lū svāhā.*

With hands crossed, they recite the *Eight Buddha-Mothers Mantra*:
*Nī là mā dū mó,*
*Bā dǎ hé là dū mó,*
*Mā gā— bā là dū mó,*
*— bā là dū mó,*
*Dá— dá— — dū mó,*
*Wū dá— dū mó,*
*Wū bā— nǎ dū mó,*
*Dá— dá— dū mó,*
*Oṃ mā lī jiē— svāhā.*

Following the left hand’s *Dipper Seal*, they circulate qi seven times:
*Hā svā— jiē lī mā oṃ.*

Reversing with the right hand’s *Dipper Seal*, they circulate qi seven times.

The master completes the visualization and proceeds:
Bowing, they welcome and invite as prescribed in the ritual protocol.

The ordained disciple, humble descendant of the mysterious lineage, so-and-so, with sincere devotion prostrates and pays homage:

On the day when asuras warred in heaven,
When apocalyptic fires raged through the human realm,
Four heads manifested divine transformations,
Eight arms extended, wielding the power of the Dao.
Ever roaming before the sun and moon,
Standing alone amidst the three realms of blades and warfare,
Radiant with awe-inspiring majesty,
Perfect in wondrous form,
You lift sentient beings beyond all suffering.
Though the vast void may end,
Your original vow remains boundless.
Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—
Nine Heavens’ Thunder Ancestor, Great Emperor,
Solar Palace’s Radiant Emperor,
Lunar Mansion’s Supreme Sovereign,
Holy and Benevolent Primordial Dipper Mother, Purple Radiance Golden Honored One,
Sacred Virtue’s Resplendent Radiance Heavenly Queen,
Mārīcī, Heaven’s Great Sage, Perfect Illumination Dao Mother, Heavenly Worthy.

The disciple so-and-so, with sincere devotion, prostrates and pays homage:

In the Western Land of India,
Amidst the Great Wisdom Light,
True Emptiness, Wondrous Form—Dharma King and Master,
Supreme Primordial Heavenly Mother Sovereign,
Where golden light blazes, sun and moon dim their splendor,
When the jeweled vajra spins, ghosts and spirits lose their hue.
Manifesting divine traces in the mortal world,
Guarding the sacred chariot in Jambudvīpa,
When sentient beings face peril,
Merely invoking the name of the Great Being,
You respond to cries and come to relieve suffering.
Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—
Sacred Virtue’s Resplendent Radiance Heavenly Queen,
Savior from All Perils, Mārīcī, Heaven’s Great Sage, Perfect Illumination Dao Mother, Heavenly Worthy.

The ritual protocol concludes.

The disciple humbly gazes upward, beseeching:
Great Compassion, transcending the realm of life and death,
Utmost Spirit, Supreme Sage, seeing through the machinations of ghosts and spirits,
We pray that your divine power shields and protects us,
Dispelling the thousand calamities and ten thousand misfortunes.
We, daring to approach your majesty,
Are overwhelmed with reverence.
Gazing toward heaven, longing for your sacred presence,
We earnestly await your gracious command.
Bowing again, we respectfully speak:
Having performed the rites of invitation,
We trust you will grace us with your presence.
As the Dipper’s radiance divides,
Earth spirits surround your seat,
Jewels align like jade and pearls,
Illuminating the nine smokes of the central land.
With a glance, the Dao is present,
Offering the first spring grasses of Yangxian.
Bowing in reverence,
We present fragrant tea and incense.

Scattering flowers.

The ordained disciple, humble descendant of the mysterious lineage, so-and-so, bows again and petitions:
To the Ten Supreme Perfected of the Wondrous Dao of Emptiness,
Brahma-Qi Dragon Han Heavenly Lords,
Purple Radiance Golden Honored One, Sacred Virtue Heavenly Queen,
Mārīcī, Heaven’s Great Emperor,
Dipper Mansion’s Stellar Constellations and Luminous Hosts,
True Sovereigns overseeing our destined stars,
Jade Brahma Heaven’s *Louluo* King,
Wondrous Brahma Heaven’s *Qialou* King,
Great Brahma Heaven’s Direct Attendant Forest Messengers,
Ancestral Masters, Lineage Masters, Scriptural Masters, and the Three Masters of Transmission,
Thunder Gods, Heavenly Generals, and all mighty numina,
Lamp altars descending to witness,
Assembled host of perfected beings,
We humbly beseech your heavenly compassion to shine forth in clear witness.

We have heard:
When the primordial qi first unfolded,
Myriad spirits arrayed themselves.
Heaven’s height, earth’s depth,
Combined the yin and yang in their forging.
Sun’s illumination, moon’s presence,
Divided the marvelous workings of day and night.
Looking up, we revere the Dipper’s Pole as the true governor of heaven’s work,
Aligned with the Seven Governors and Five Phases,
Pivot of creation,
Commanding the myriad spirits and ruling the Three Realms,
Guiding the warp and weft of heaven and earth.
Bowing at the jade steps,
The first libation of wine is poured.

Scattering flowers.

The ordained disciple, humble descendant of the mysterious lineage, so-and-so, petitions:
To the Ten Supreme Perfected of the Wondrous Dao of Emptiness,
Brahma-Qi Dragon Han Heavenly Lords,
Purple Radiance Golden Honored One, Sacred Virtue Heavenly Queen,
Mārīcī, Heaven’s Great Sage, Perfect Illumination Dao Mother, Heavenly Worthy,

True Sovereigns overseeing our destined stars,
Jade Brahma Heaven’s *Louluo* King,
Wondrous Brahma Heaven’s *Qialou* King,
Great Brahma Heaven’s Direct Attendant Forest Messengers,
Ancestral Masters, Lineage Masters, Scriptural Masters, and the Three Masters of Transmission,
Thunder Gods, Heavenly Generals, and all mighty numina,
Lamp altars descending to witness,
Assembled host of perfected beings,
We humbly beseech your heavenly compassion to shine forth in clear witness.

We have heard:
The Dao expounds the profound and subtle,
Rooted in the primordial qi’s wondrous mystery.
The stars’ radiance shines upon the Purple Pole,
Revealing the Northern Dipper’s palace of the Seven Primes.
Luminous and bright, the spirit chamber’s numinous clarity,
Deep and abyssal, the spring’s utmost profundity.
Silver lamps gleam with splendor,
Jade talismans waft with smoke.
We offer refined libations and pure wine,
Striving for utmost sincerity.
Crowned with auspicious clouds, draped in sun and moon,
We wish to always behold your honored presence.
Thus, we present the fragrant chalice,
Pouring the second libation.

Scattering blossoms,

Lineage-disciple, the remote descendant of the Mysterious and Profound, your humble servant [Name], with utmost sincerity, reverently invokes the Ten Supreme Perfected of the Wondrous Dao of Emptiness and Non-Being, the Celestial Lord of the Dragon Han and Father of the Dipper, the Great Emperor of Heaven and Mother of the Dipper Mo Li, the Heavenly Honored One of the Luminous Dao and Mother of the Round Brightness, the Nine August Sovereigns of the Northern Dipper’s Great Dao, the Original Stellar Spirits of the Circumpolar Constellations and One’s Own Destiny, the Two August Kings of the Jade Mystery and Brahmā Heavens, the Dipper’s Intermediary Tongue-Containing Deity, the Forest Envoys of the Great Brahmā Heavenly Palace, the Patriarchs and Perfected Masters, the Thunder Gods and Celestial Generals, and the assembled host of perfected beings who descend to witness the lamp altar.

We humbly beseech the Dao’s compassion to shine forth in clear witness.

We have heard:
The Great Dao is formless, wondrously gathering in emptiness to respond to all things.
When ordinary folk harbor desires, they spread their robes to present their pleas.
Gazing afar at the radiance of the Yellow Dao,
we perceive the subtle workings of its vast transformative power.
We pray that the Most Perfected may take pity,
that the August Emperor may bestow great favor—
what disaster would not be extinguished?
What blessing would not be attained?
May we ever rely upon the Dao’s sheltering shade,
where all we face comes to fruition,
all we do finds harmony.
In action and repose alike, may we depend upon your numinous grace.
Thus, with utmost sincerity,
we present the three libations of wine.

Scattering blossoms,

The humble servant [Name], lineage-disciple and remote descendant of the Mysterious and Profound, with utmost sincerity, reverently invokes the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Ancestor, the Primordial Heavenly Brahmā of the Qian Origin and Vast Light, the Dipper Mother, the Golden August and Purple Radiance Honored Heavenly Empress of Sagely Virtue, and the Heavenly Honored One of the Luminous Dao and Mother of the Round Brightness.
With this true incense,
we universally offer homage.

We have heard:
Utmost numinosity, utmost sageliness—
even ghosts and spirits cannot fathom their mystery.
Utmost sageliness, utmost compassion—
transcending the paths of life and death that do not touch them.
Majestic and resplendent,
their wondrous forms perfectly fused,
once in the kingdom ruled by the Zhou,
they made vast vows.
Bathed in the warm jade pool,
they manifested as golden lotuses,
giving birth to nine sons
who govern all beings.
Ascending to dwell in the august center,
they serve as the wellspring of all life.
Dissolving karmic enmity, releasing opposition—
like the nine suns melting the ice mountains.
Delivering from distress, supporting the frail—
causing the Seven Primes to revolve in the depths of the abyss.
Standing alone amid the calamities of war,
ever roaming before the heavens of sun and moon,
they guide all beings,
liberating them from every suffering.

We have further heard:
The August Star of the Purple Tenuity,
encircled by all stars,
is the chief of the celestial pivot,
truly the office of the tongue and voice.
Since it deigns to shine upon us,
how dare we fail to revere and serve it?
Reflecting humbly,
we were wondrously divided from the primordial qi
and born into the human realm.
Our form and appearance,
all depend upon the refining and forging of creation.
Yet as days and months pass,
we have strayed from the diligence of incense and offerings.
Every action bears a hundred faults,
no moment holds a single good.
Now, in feeble offering of our morning audience,
we look up to implore your vast protection.
Thus, we present words of self-confession,
hoping for the blessing of renewal.
Precious woods burn as incense,
lamps gleam with jade-like blossoms.
We perform the triple bows to pray for grace,
knock our heads to the Northern Star in reverence.
Bowing low, we present our sincere devotion;
looking up, we long for your pure radiance.
We reverently pray that the imperial heart may take pity,
that the sagely decree may be proclaimed:
erasing the ledger of sins,
extinguishing the roots of evil—
let it be announced in the palaces of sun and moon.
Striking our names from the register of death,
inscribing them in the celestial records of life—
let it shine upon the Dipper’s pole in the immortals’ courts.
Firmly rooting blessings, forever extinguishing misfortune,
truly securing our life’s pulse, eternally extending our lifespan.
May salary not be interrupted,
may horses not perish in vain.
Like joined jade disks, like linked pearls,
may radiance illumine our bodies.
May our destiny be refined, our souls cast anew,
strengthened within the fiery prison of the mundane world.
Through the four seasons, may joyous qi ever arrive;
by the seven luminaries, may yin and yang never falter.
May wood flourish and metal cut away calamity,
may fire’s flames subside and water’s grace flow.
May earth’s thickness nurture growth,
may qi rise with auspicious omens.
May the heavens’ decree avert harm from punishments,
may the spirits’ wrath turn away from fury.
May fortune, longevity, health, and peace prevail,
with no more strange portents arising from the hairline.
May nurturing transformation and growth
ever receive the descent of our destiny’s true spirits.
We, lacking talent and crude in learning,
have presumptuously practiced the methods of the teachings.
On the day we received the registers and transmitted talismans,
we pledged to break the bonds of karmic debt.
We vowed to diligently aid beings for the benefit of others,
and thus permitted memorials to be sent aloft.
When ordinary folk harbor desires,
heaven’s will must comply.
All the original memorials from the heart,
we now respectfully proclaim.

Proclaim the memorial.
Prostrate in reverence.

Upon reviewing the memorial as submitted, all has been duly reported and presented. The Great Dao is impartial and will surely grant its inspection. Yet this humble servant remains unclear of fortune’s signs and must therefore cast divination and dispatch talismans. May the gracious decree be swiftly bestowed to fulfill the common folk’s devotion. Whether fortune or misfortune, obscurity or adversity, blessing or calamity, doubt or anxiety—may the four directions be clearly designated, and retribution distinctly manifested.

Rise and step forth to summon the generals.
Raise the Talisman of Five-Colored Auspicious Clouds.
Dispatch the memorial talisman.

We, prostrate in reverence, acknowledge the nine-tiered golden gates of the lofty Brahma-Heaven, where a single intent of sincere devotion exhausts the most reverent and humble of faith. In strict accordance with the sacred canons, we now present and bow before the talismanic memorial. Having already submitted it at the jade steps, it is fitting to burn it at the cloud-post station. Today, we invoke and beseech:

The Jade Brahma Venerable Heavenly Louluo King,
The Wondrous Brahma Venerable Heavenly Qieluo King,
The Nine Heavens’ Gang Celestial Swift Retribution Envoys—Messenger Zhang,
The Dipper’s Yang-Bearing Tuoluo Twin Envoys,
The Dipper’s Intermediary Steward,
The Three Realms’ Merit Officers and Talisman Envoys,
The Word-Offering Incense Fire Controller of Destiny and Local Earth Deities,
The Altar’s Official Generals and Responsive Deities—

Upon hearing this invocation, may they swiftly manifest their majestic power. As there are documents at the altar, they shall now be proclaimed.

Proclaim the memorial document.
Unseal the Heavenly Talisman.

Having just recited and declared the talismanic memorial, we trust that, bathed in the awe of thunderous might, it will surely receive luminous scrutiny. Yet the Gang winds and vast qi cannot be traversed by mortal form, and the Dipper’s Palace and Thunder Bureau possess divine power that may be reached. We urgently beseech them to ride clouds and mount mist, stride across the void, and soar aloft. With a single cast of the fire bell, its radiance illuminates the eight wilds; with a single flight of thunder’s light, it ascends through the Three Realms. Proceed directly to the Crimson Heaven’s gates, hasten straight to the Purple Ultimate’s walls, open the immortal realm of canonical rites, and reach the golden throne of the august seat. May the sincerity of the common folk be conveyed, imperial edicts brilliantly issued, and the originally descended talismanic memorial swiftly carried upward. The incumbent, reverently bearing the Emperor’s mandate, wields the seal and talismans, holding sole authority over thunder’s commands and governing the Dipper’s Palace in matters of memorials and expiations. Let decrees descend swift as shooting stars, and methods spread rapid as wind and mist. The Three Realms shall not delay, and retribution shall be made manifest in a single moment.

The dispatch is complete.

The preceding merits of supplication and offerings, directed upward to the stellar perfected, turning the Dipper and shifting the stars, are all reliant on virtuous deeds. For all who sincerely partake in this rite, we humbly pray that heaven be clear and earth tranquil, all dharmas harmoniously regulated, the world at peace and the state secure, and all beings universally sustained. As for this humble self, may the great creation’s unfathomable grace shield me from unforeseen calamities, and may the sun’s light dispel misfortune, bringing only fitting blessings. Like a river’s flow, may fortune arrive in full, and should peril or danger loom, may it be wholly averted by this support. The preceding merits of supplication and offerings, directed upward to the Dipper’s perfected, aid in the realization of the supreme Dao for all who sincerely partake in this rite.

The Precelestial Dipper Mother’s Memorial Rite of the Mysterious Canon is now concluded.
