**Stele Inscription for the Temple of the Divine Aid Kings**

The renowned county of the Fu Prefecture is Min; the esteemed village of Min is Jishan. The Temple of the Divine Aid Kings stands as the revered sanctuary of the region, its sheltering canopy and blessings sought by all. In its early years, those who sought fortune and entreated the divine often resorted to spirit-writing with planchettes, inscribing couplets or cryptic verses. Though the miracles and proofs of efficacy remain vivid in memory, no written records were then preserved.

Later, villagers gathered beneath the temple’s eaves to pray, gazing upon its dilapidated halls—roofs sagging, beams rotting, murals dimmed—and said to one another: *"Can this truly convey our reverence or secure the spirits’ favor?"* They resolved to restore it, divining the gods’ will through the planchette. Thus, the divine responded with resounding clarity, revealing texts to guide the work. Once the labor was complete, the gods spoke again, their words—every phrase and utterance—now rendered in writing. From then on, long compositions and brief verses emerged in profusion, their brilliance dazzling the eye, their fluency loosening the scribe’s wrist. The gods’ writings surged forth like a boundless flood, their influence spreading to neighboring towns and villages, where people copied them with awe, transcribing, annotating, debating, and marveling. Could such words ever spring from mortal lips?

It is said that when the imperial plaque was first petitioned, the gods’ surnames and given names were unknown. Elders, drawing on ancient lore, settled on the surname *Xu*. Though the surname was thus established, the finer details of their lineage and titles remained obscure. Now, however, the origins of their illustrious legacy and the abundance of their miraculous deeds are fully revealed. The gods are one in essence, not withholding their favor in the past. After years of entreaty, they now manifest thus, startling even the most discerning. Perhaps this flourishing of texts presages the gods’ intent to herald their blessings and unveil their power—or perhaps their transformative will acts with purpose. Ah! Those who would fathom the gods’ hearts must understand: like torrents surging against the current, their roar is deafening, yet the silent flow at midstream is mightier still. In revealing their words to humanity, the gods act not by choice but by necessity.

In the Three Dynasties, there were no "men of letters"; the Six Classics contain no "rules of composition." The sagely and wise who left writings for posterity did not craft them for ostentation. The subtleties of ruler-minister relations compelled Confucius to write the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. The fading of benevolence and righteousness moved Mencius to compose his seven chapters. Had the Kingly Way prevailed, the works of the magistrate of Lanling might never have been written. Had rites and music been restored, poetry would not have perished, and Master Wen might have played his zither by the Fen River—what need would there have been for transformation? Yet if the transmission to later generations does not rely on texts, on what else could it depend?

The gods’ intent aligns with that of the sages and worthies. They grant steles to reveal their deeds, divination slips to foretell fortune and misfortune. When mountains and rivers fade into obscurity, they compose texts to reclaim them. When customs grow base and corrupt, they write *The Ballad of Liangfu* to satirize them. As reverence wanes and the scholar’s spirit decays, they pen *The Last Poem* and *The Rhapsody Against the Gods* to admonish. Even *The Song of the Unicorn* and self-defense essays, along with poems of shifting forms—elegant, upright, strange, and rugged—abound in myriad styles, like a cascade of radiant verses or the harmonious utility of grain, cloth, and silk. Such is the nature of their writings—how could it be mere chapters, lines, and punctuation?

If the people of this village recite the gods’ texts and reflect upon their intent, the entire community will be steeped in Dao and virtue. In every hamlet of ten households, loyalty and trust will flourish. Whether tilling the fields, plying trades, engaging in commerce, laboring, or resolving disputes—whether through courtesy, deference, litigation, friendship, or leisure—they will honor the fundamental. At such a time, they may wander in the realm of the sages and ascend to the unfathomable heavens. Why, then, should the gods’ writings be confined to temple inscriptions? The reverse side of the stele reads: *"Though I have imitated even a fraction of Master Liu’s skill, without Master Wen to record it, how can I instruct future generations?"*

Yet in Han Yu’s records, beyond filial piety toward parents, wifely obedience to husbands, and the virtues of kindness, brotherly love, and fraternal duty, there is little superfluous language. The gods’ bequest to later generations through Master Wen was nothing more than a devotion to upholding the world’s teachings. Alas! My talents are meager—how dare I aspire to even a fraction of Master Wen’s brilliance? Like a turtle’s eye or a cicada’s wing, I dare not chirp beneath the thunder. Yet I recall that since the Later Jin’s Kaiyun era, the gods have dwelled in Min. My ancestors, too, migrated from Gushi to Min during the Five Dynasties. Over generations, some developed the land to build the gods’ temple, while others petitioned the court to honor their divine titles. The worship of these gods has endured for years. Now, the villagers, united in purpose, have contributed to its restoration, hoping for the gods’ boundless protection. How could I remain silent?

As for the gods’ surnames, their generational names, their illustrious deeds, and the miracles they have wrought—along with the temple’s founding and renovations—these are all detailed in the gods’ own inscriptions. A mere scribe like myself has no place to interject. My purpose here is merely to elucidate the gods’ intent in composing these texts: that the people of this land, nourished by its mulberries and hemp, may cherish its harmonious melodies. If all cultivate Dao and virtue, returning to loyalty and trust, then even the simplest offerings—jade-like wine in a worm-eaten ladle, minced pork and tender chicken, or river weeds and stream water—will suffice to answer the gods’ hearts.

Without teachings, the gods’ grace and humanity’s blessings would be limitless, cycling endlessly without cease.

The gods’ writings herald auspicious omens, unfolding numinous power for those who came before, while their literary brilliance soars like blossoms, bearing fruit for those who follow. Thus shall we witness the celestial favor of ennobling titles bestowed, the gods’ glory resplendent in full display. (On the tenth day of the first lunar month), purple mists swirl and azure clouds rise, golden cups overflow with peppered wine—such is the height of human splendor. At such a time, there must surely be a brush as grand as a rafter to record these events. I shall await with keen eyes, lest Master Wen alone claim the beauty of Magistrate Liu’s legacy.

Moreover, south of the Min River and beyond the Yangtze Gorges, a towering mountain rises—Mount Aofeng. To its south lies the Divine Aid Immortal Palace. Long ago, the humble shrine’s hidden traces became manifest; the state drew upon its merit, the people relied on its protection. Honors were bestowed, titles conferred, and rites observed with reverence—even to this day, how flourishing! Yet over the years, the temple’s beams and rafters have decayed beyond repair, its vermilion and azure hues fading into obscurity.

One day, villagers came to the shrine to divine their tasks. Seeing its state, they said to one another: “This is no way to honor the devout or soothe the spirits. Let us restore and renew it, each contributing our utmost.” The gods rejoiced in their earnest resolve and, before descending to compose a text, sought to encourage them. Thus, they pooled their sincerity, gathered funds, and commanded craftsmen to measure materials. Each shouldered their duties without delay: narrow gates were widened, dry ponds replenished.

Every rotted beam and broken tile was replaced. Colors adorned the statues, robes draped their forms. Civil and martial figures alike were renewed in splendor. Their majestic presence blazed forth, their virtue shone resplendent. All who saw or heard were filled with reverence. Joyful in their offerings, the work was completed—it was the eighth month of autumn.

Yet the merit was not their own; they ascribed it to the gods’ favor. Rising at dawn, they prepared offerings and announced the completion, seeking to soothe and honor the divine with due ceremony. They extolled the gods’ power, recounting their deeds across three dynasties, from the Five Dynasties onward, and the blessings bestowed upon the illustrious Empress Dowager. Those who now receive offerings in this temple are remembered in both summary and detail, and thus this record is made.

The assembled workers were struck with awe, their gazes filled with reverence, their voices murmuring in wonder. The scribe then said: “Before, when we petitioned for the inscribed plaque, the divined surname was Xu. It was as if hidden in the sacred, unknowable. Now we learn it descends from the lineage of King Yan—truly verified! Let us carve this in stone, illuminating the unseen and preserving it for eternity.”

Thereafter, literary compositions emerged in layers, the *Yi* hexagrams bore slips for divining fortune, the *Ode of Liangfu* served as exhortation. Was it the gods who composed these? They revealed the obscure and boundless. The sealing of wells had its rules, the avoidance of taboos its prohibitions. Be it odes, rhapsodies, disputations, petitions, melodies, or gāthās—thousands of forms, myriad styles, ever more wondrous. Like cliffs suspended in empty space, towering and sheer. Like waves in a raging storm, surging and roaring.

Ah, what writing is this! For writing is the essence of celestial patterns in the heavens, the treasure of charts and texts on earth, the auspicious sign of courtly refinement in humanity. Yet the gods—elusive in the indistinct, dwelling in the unfathomable, unseen in shadow, unheard in echo—now manifest through writing. Why? Their wisdom is pure and upright, their majesty severe. Their numinous power and radiant might soar high. Though unseen, they see all; though unheard, they hear all. Emerging from Qian, entering Kun, spanning past and present. Discerning the future, revealing the past, making the subtle manifest and the hidden clear. Thus they unleash celestial essence, split open earthly treasures, and bring forth the literary auspices of humanity. The gods’ virtue has not waned with heaven. The earth does not withhold its patterns, allowing humanity to unfold this culture.

The gods wander the realm of the scentless and soundless—this is fitting. Yet to entrust this not to humans but to the gods—how remarkable! The essence of Ao Peak, the brilliance of Dragon’s Head, must give rise to extraordinary figures. May the gods continue to favor this culture! Otherwise, why would such auspicious signs appear?

The gods’ prose declares: “What I create must serve as proof for future ages, a stepping stone for advancement.”
The gods’ poetry says:
*“Is writing not precious?*
*The noble one’s glory endures like the leopard’s splendor.”*

Was this my intent? The cycles of creation turn endlessly, nothing departs without return. To make the divine manifest—this lies with humanity.

Its verses read:
*“Ao Peak winds sinuously,*
*The Palace of Numinous Aid stands.”*

O radiant are the former worthies, their filial devotion like that of King Yan! Their temple endures through the ages, their sacrifices nourishing the land. The four classes of people and the bounty of the earth all depend on their blessings. Embracing and pacifying all around, their luminous glory shines resplendent. They greatly uphold this culture, bringing forth its auspiciousness. Reverently honoring the divine with solemnity, they repay their origins with utmost devotion. Vows of praise and song endure—through a hundred generations, never forgotten.

*The Record of the Renovation of the Lingji Palace*

What humans serve are the gods. What the gods rely upon are humans. On this propitious day of early brightness, the gods manifest their numinous power, their resplendent writings entrusted to those of shared purpose. With reverent awe and vigilance, day and night, they dare not grow remiss. Thus, they adorn the sacred images, commanding the stewards of vestments to prepare the robes. Once completed, the gods themselves compose their own chronicles, inscribing them upon the stele.

How vast and majestic! How solemn and awe-inspiring—such words could not be uttered by common speech. Stirring and startling, who would not dare to offer all they possess in response?

Those of shared purpose conferred: "The eastern and western ponds have dried up—how can this fail to diminish the temple’s grandeur? The outer walls are crumbling—how can this inspire reverence in people’s hearts? The well at Dragon’s Head, long a blight upon the land, has already been abandoned. Now, let us seal this well, dig these ponds, and paint these walls to delight the gods’ will. This will also benefit the people—is it not fitting?"

They agreed: "It shall be done."

The gods of the Eastern and Western Academies, long obscured by dust, have been neglected, for the age now favors martial pursuits. Some wish to remove them to make way for military plans. Yet those of shared purpose recall Confucius’ words: *"Culture must be accompanied by martial readiness, and martial strength by cultural preparedness."* Civil governance and military achievement support one another—this is an unchanging principle through a hundred generations. How could it be abandoned? Thus, above, they honor the shrines of the Three Stars of Fortune and Prosperity; below, they enshrine the images of those who assist the state and pacify the people. First civil, then martial—each in its proper place.

They agreed once more: "It shall be done."

Beyond the gates, the old halls stand; within, the protective barriers are imposing. The vermilion eaves and carved beams gleam brilliantly; the inner courtyards’ adornments are unmatched. Every crack and leak has been meticulously repaired. Only the two storehouses remain lowly and filthy, neglected and decaying.

The villagers, gripped by great fear, could not endure even a single day’s delay. Once more, they conferred with their colleagues and beseeched the gods, saying: “We have long been engaged in this work, wishing to cease yet unable to rest. Our intent is clear—may the gods comprehend it.” The gods responded in writing: “To restore the temple is difficult, yet we follow where duty leads. How could we fail to grasp your meaning?”

Thereupon, they renewed all that was decayed and blackened—rafters and beams, broken and missing roof tiles, uneven and crumbling walls—each made anew. At that time, the gods bestowed a second inscription, naming the storehouses: to the east, “Harmony of Kinship,” and to the west, “Feast of Joy.” Thus, those of humble station might find expression, and their virtues be arrayed in full splendor—abundant, flourishing, and complete in every excellence. Though this was the fruit of their collective effort, it was the gods’ divine power that brought it to pass.

As the work neared completion, they petitioned Zhang Gongduo, the regional administrator, to bestow an inscription. The temple was then elevated in rank, called a *gong*. The strokes of the brush and the characters’ bold forms dazzled the eye. All who passed by—carriages and crowds filling the roads for days—marveled in admiration, their reverence deepening.

The stele on the eastern street was the gods’ own composition; the inscription on the western steps, the people’s praise of their virtues. The gods’ literary works, displayed throughout the temple, included steles, records, plaques, eulogies, essays, rhapsodies, memorials, petitions, debates, discussions, prefaces, odes, poems, songs, conduct, and discourses. Their collected works, circulated in the world, shone with brilliance, worthy of recounting.

The honorific titles bestowed upon Lingji, the ennoblement of the True Man of former dynasties, the proclamation of celestial favor—his virtue resplendent, his renown enduring through the ages. This is what the white-haired elders and humble village officials long to extol, beyond the mere words of the local people.

After seven days, they returned with their colleagues, solemnly offering sacrificial animals and wine to perform the rite of completion. Taking their places in the courtyard, they reflected with awe. Three years of diligent service had passed—surely the gods, mindful of their merit, would bless them, granting the villagers shared fortune and ensuring their descendants’ reverence for generations. How could they forget its origin?

Now, they wished to carve this account in stone, yet feared critics might accuse them of monopolizing praise. Thus, they first recorded the date at Lingji Gong, then inscribed this inscription:

*Appointed from the Nine Heavens,*
*Fearing the divine below.*
*The gods’ brush stirs awe,*
*Its might unstoppable.*
*Adorned in robes and splendor,*
*As the body’s glory.*
*“Harmony of Kinship,” “Feast of Joy,”*
*Names for the halls.*
*Laborers and craftsmen summoned,*
*The temple made new.*
*From all directions they gathered,*
*Completing the work by day’s end.*
*Three years of service reviewed,*
*Each fulfilling their duty.*
*Difficult and cautious,*
*Yet united in harmony.*
*The gods now at rest,*
*The people rejoicing.*
*Revering this teaching,*
*Trusting and obeying.*
*O gods, bestow*
*Your blessings upon our people.*
*Heaven witnesses your virtue,*
*Granting the title of True Man.*
*Your images radiant,*
*Ever-present in splendor.*
*Your people offer sacrifices,*
*Unceasing through ten thousand generations.*
*Future gentlemen,*
*Do not abandon this achievement.*
*Carved upon these walls,*
*To praise its beginnings.*

**Record of the Restoration of Lingji Gong**
In the tenth month of the thirtieth year of the Zhiyuan era, in Min’s Jishanli, the scholar Zhang Jungui presented a written account of Lingji Wang’s temple, saying: “This is the gods’ own writing. The village has an ancient temple but no stele, its halls nearly in ruins.” In the fifth month, Shen Jianweng undertook its restoration, and Jungui, together with Zhou Tong and others, collaborated to bring it to completion. By the eighth month, the work was finished.

The gods manifested their power, bestowing an inscription to be carved in stone. They commanded Lin Digong Yannian of the village to transcribe it and entrusted me with inscribing the title. I dared not refuse and signed my name with reverence. In the twelfth month, they presented an ancient poem, saying: “This records the gods’ intent—why not inscribe it?” Though I had already assented, my brush had not yet found the time.

The following year, in the first month, they came in person to seek my promise and produced a poem bestowed by the gods—sixty-five verses in all. What connection have I to such literature, that the gods should urge me so earnestly? Once, the river god greeted Wang Bo, saying: “The Pavilion of Prince Teng is to have a preface—go and compose it.” At the time, the host had already prepared one with his son-in-law. Yet Wang Bo’s work emerged unexpectedly—was there not a destined hand for such writing?

Thereupon, I burned incense, struck my teeth together, and recited the record and poem several times. They bore no trace of mortal speech, and I exclaimed: “How extraordinary! To be wise, upright, and just is the essence of divinity; to awe with power and majesty is but its excess. This temple, since the Kaiyun era of Later Jin, has stood for ages. For years, the villagers have served with pure devotion—how could today’s events arise without cause?”

Scholar Zhang replied: “The gods’ writings extend beyond this record and poem. In former years, when their numinous light was still concealed, only fragments of words appeared. Now, their radiance shines forth, their compositions resplendent, engaging with people. Their intent guides—sometimes urging duty, sometimes leading to goodness, sometimes exhorting filial piety and reverence. When matters arise, they compose works like *Sealing the Well*, *Rhapsody on the Non-Divine*, *Biography of the Painter*, *Eulogy for the Mural*, *Chants of Liangfu*, and *Songs of the Unicorn*. There are prefaces, postscripts, memorials, debates, conduct, songs, odes, petitions—thousands of forms, each more marvelous than the last. Those who hear of it bring provisions and follow in admiration. If one approaches the gods with sincerity, they respond according to need. To knock and inquire is to receive—every word, every phrase, is literature.”

The Laurel Dragon and Elder Jian, ascending and descending at its side, never failed to seek its writings day and night, using affairs to invoke the text and the text to verify affairs. Their hands responded to their hearts as if by contract or bond, thus joining their strength in this to extol the divine mandate’s glory.

I then composed and sighed: This writing may well approach perfection—heaven sends timely rain, mountains and rivers bring forth clouds, and desires arise in due course. That which opens must first attend to spirits and gods; those who receive omens before the imperial court’s proclamations are the pitch-pipes of divine illumination. Since the Tang, our dynasty has selected scholars through examinations, and those born in this age vie to make their names through writing. Among the gods of Shu, there is one named Zitong, who manifests numinous power in that region and exclusively governs examination success. When the writings of the Ninety-Four Transformations were first intoned, the scholars of Shu revered and cherished him as if serving their own parents. Whenever one rose through perilous examinations to high office, they dared not claim their own ability but instead called it the god’s gift. Thus, scholars from other regions everywhere enshrined and worshipped him. The incense and altars of Zitong soon spread throughout the land. No honorific title bestowed upon him surpassed his renown.

Today’s Lingji is the former day’s Zitong. Zitong flourished in Shu, while Lingji flourishes in Min. The writings of the Ninety-Four Transformations may not surpass it; we shall see the god’s incense and altars spread across the land just as Zitong’s did—how could his blessings be confined to a single region? Yet this writing, like heaven and earth, has never for a day been extinguished. What is temporarily obscured must become clear; what is temporarily obstructed must flourish. Thus, the gods have means to manifest their auspiciousness.

Once the divine stele was erected, the local scholars rejoiced and celebrated. At that time, Magistrate Zhou Zhuangxi presented the inscription for the stele’s reverse, saying: The gods of mountains must descend before they are born; the gods of Shenshen must descend before they are born. Will the present lord be born, or will he be born as the lord? These words, as if someone had guided his hand and pried open his mouth, were spoken thus. As the land’s numinosity grows daily more manifest, outstanding figures will emerge in kind. In time, they will surely make their names through writing. The nation’s prosperity is not only cause for scholars to rejoice but even more so for the gods.

The god’s surname was Xu. In life, he was a man; in death, he became a god. His merit lay in the state, his virtue in the people. The origins of his renown and the sequence of his temple enfeoffments are all recorded in the god’s own accounts. Here, I merely outline the temple’s restoration, the descent of writings, and the stele’s erection.

Magistrate Zhang further said: When the imperial plaque was first requested in the past, the god’s surname and given name were unknown. The elders divined among the surnames and drew “Xu,” then named him *Wang*—“Hope”—implying his virtue could match the Four Directions, making him worthy of ranked sacrifices. Now, the god himself says: I am Jiang Wang, named Zhi Zheng; my younger brother is Rao Wang, named Zhi E. Thus, names are rectified, and origins are known.

I once read the *History of the Five Dynasties* and, upon reaching the hereditary house of Wu, sighed over the Qi King’s lineage. When he, along with Liu Wei and Tao Ya, assisted Yang Xingmi in rising in Huainan, they were heroes of their age. Yet once he gained power, he ruled with such dominance. Nevertheless, he honored the Yang clan’s orphans and served them as a subject—how starkly this differs from Zhang Wenbiao’s refusal to serve Zhou Baoquan! The cosmos is boundless, past events are but dust, yet he had two sons whose names have fragranced a hundred years and whose temples have been fed for ten thousand generations. Alas, the Qi King has not died after all.

Recorded on the day *jiazi*, two days before the Lantern Festival.

*Preface to the Perfected Lingji*

The god’s surname, given name, and native place are recorded in the *History of the Five Dynasties*. In the fourth year of the *kaiyun* era of the Jin, the Perfected One harmonized with the imperial numen and descended here in radiant splendor. Counting by the ancient calendar, over two thousand *jiazi* cycles have passed. In the second year of the *jiaxi* era, upon receiving the court’s decree, we examined the *Rites of Sacrifice* and found him worthy of inclusion in the sacrificial canon. On every Three Primordials, Eight Festivals, *jiazi*, *gengshen*, and Dipper-Descending days, those who have matters to bring before the god must fast, purify themselves, and offer vegetarian sacrifices, holding solely to the god. Hold fast and do not lose this, and you will unite with the god. To unite is to merge with nature itself.

The Yellow Emperor obtained it and ascended to the cloudy heavens. The Queen Mother of the West obtained it and sat in the Lesser Broadness. Now the spirit and soul of this god remain unclouded in their clarity, having obtained it to bestow upon Fuqiu Gong, Wangzi Qiao, Jin’s Sima Ziwei, Feng Dahe, and others, who roam the boundless heavens. Listen, yet no sound is heard—its sound is resplendent. Look, yet no name is seen—its name is lofty and luminous. The four seasons keep their proper order, the myriad things suffer no harm, and beneficent moisture is dispensed throughout heaven and earth. Who in later ages could ever fathom this?

Long ago, Master Nanhua cited the words of the *Great Master*: "Only when there is a Perfected One does there arise true knowledge." Recently, we reverently encountered the Thirty-Eighth Heavenly Master, who transmitted the *Great Simplicity’s Congealed Spirit*. The Broad Dao Perfected One, through the knowledge he possessed, ever regarded true knowledge as his teacher. Accordingly, a special memorial was submitted to the Celestial Capital, appointing Jiang Wang as the *Nine Heavens Golden Portal Radiant Dao Penetrating Virtue Great Immortal Manifest Numinous Universal Salvation Perfected One*, and his consort, Lady Xu, as the *Specially Appointed Harmonious Assisting Benevolent Immortal Consort*. Rao Wang was appointed as the *Nine Heavens Jade Portal Proclaiming Transformation Assisting Teaching High Immortal Illustrious Numinous Vast Salvation Perfected One*, and his consort, Lady Tao, as the *Specially Appointed Kindly Assisting Compassionate Immortal Consort*. Their illustrious renown blazes forth, leading the dragon’s way, so that the numinous powers in heaven may proclaim their mighty deeds.

Today, in this era of Great Peace, no thing resists or defies; timely rain and sunshine respond in harmony. The villagers, scholars, and common folk all rejoice and leap for joy, facing north to dance, bow with clasped hands, and prostrate themselves, offering prayers for the emperor’s boundless longevity and the singular virtue of the god. May this record be inscribed for posterity upon metal and stone. A poem is appended to the account:

Obtaining the One, it becomes numinous—
This is called the god.
The god as god—
Yet able to refine essence.
Dim and obscure,
Without action, without form.
Possessing nature and feeling,
It merges with the Dao in truth.
Proclaimed as Perfected One,
He soars to memorialize the Celestial Capital.
His singular merits and deeds—
Broadcast upon metal and stone.
Great Immortal, High Immortal,
Ascending into the Nine Heavens.
Rain and sunshine never err—
He holds the power of creation.
Your people, preserved and whole,
Rejoice and leap in exultation.
Holding our sacrificial vessels,
Who would dare not be reverent?
The god’s profound virtue—
Proclaimed in this ode.
Inscribed in stone forever,
What is ten thousand times ten thousand years?

Composed by Master Mingyuan of the Complete Teaching’s Mysterious Dharma, Daoist Registrar of Fuzhou Circuit, Liu Jingfu.

*Record of the Divine Splendor of Aofeng*

South of Min City, the great river flows from west to east, called the Gorge River, then the Ford River. Some twenty *li* farther, there stands a mountain called Aofeng. It commands the finest of the surrounding peaks and converges with the waters’ confluence, and there the temple is located. Beside it, dwellings cluster like stars or a chessboard’s pieces. The god abides where the people reside, and in due seasons they offer obeisance. With sacrificial animals, fruits, and grains, they partake of the land’s bounty. The people rely on the god’s blessings, so that young and old, livestock and crops, are free from the calamities of flood or drought, and live in peace.

This mutual dependence of god and people embodies the ultimate principle of yin and yang, a bond the world cannot sever. The two gods of Aofeng, traditionally surnamed Xu, were brothers of Li Zhigao of the Southern Tang. The elder, Zhizheng, was titled *Golden Portal Perfected One*. The younger, Zhikua, was titled *Jade Portal Perfected One*. It is said that in the Tang era, they led troops into Min, passing through Zhang to suppress rebels, and encamped at Aofeng, where they rendered meritorious service. Immortals appeared on Zhi Isle, and celestial lanterns and celestial music descended upon the site, so a temple was established there.

According to history, Zhizheng was the fifth son of Li Wen’s younger brother and was enfeoffed as Jiang Wang, later changed to Wei. Zhikua was the sixth son of Li Wen’s younger brother and was enfeoffed as Rao Wang, later changed to Liang. The Min kings, Li Yan Zheng and Li Yan Xi, were at odds, and the kingdom grew increasingly disordered. The Tang dispatched their general, Cha Wen, to expel them, seizing victory to conquer the prefectures of Quan and Zhang.

The kingship is not recorded in the annals. Has the censor erred? Yet with Aofeng’s towering majesty and the mountains and rivers conjoined in harmony, it is fitting that spirits should reside here. The gods embrace the land, manifesting abundance and answering prayers—supplications as though met with direct response. Jade within the mountain moistens the trees; pearls in the deep lend radiance to the waters. Such is the principle, and how much more so when merit and virtue are born. That the villagers, upon their passing, should honor them with a shrine is but proper ritual.

Hanlin Academician and Court Attendant Gao Tingli of Changle, whose son Gao Xiong hastened to pray at the shrine, found the divine resonance so immediate it was as though he received instruction face-to-face. (He spoke of the ten celestial stems,) and in verifying these matters, not a single detail was amiss. By special edict, the divine splendor of Aofeng was painted to repay the gods’ favor. The emperor summoned his son to record these events, summarizing their essence to inform the villagers.

Composed on the fifteenth day of the ninth month in the ninth year of the Xuande era by Wang Bao of Min, Hanlin Academician, Compiler of the Hanlin Academy, and Gentleman for Fostering Virtue of the Han Prince’s Household.

Painted and inscribed by Hanlin Academician and Court Musician Gao Tingli of Changle.

*Eulogies to the Divine*, Scroll One—end

**Memorial and Felicitations**

**Memorial Congratulating the Perfected Lord on His Ennoblement**

We bow before the celestial script, where phoenix seals and dragon charters bestow names upon the virtuous and divine. Within cinnabar terraces and jade chambers, what fear is there of failing to attain immortality? Their wondrous works defy all reckoning, their reverence manifesting in every gesture of hand and foot.

I, your humble servant, offer congratulations. Reverently considering the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Aid Perfected One—how upright and just, how keen of perception and wisdom! Silently upholding the benevolence of generation and transformation, they have mastered the profound and obscure Dao. Ever vigilant in awe, ever compassionate in love, they harbor the caution of one who guards against transgression. By their merit and by their person, they have fittingly received the grace of ennoblement, a cause for universal acclaim.

At this time of flourishing achievement, who would not rejoice as though discarding sandals in haste? Who would not aspire to offer congratulations as though holding the whip of service?

I, your servant, a mere reed adrift, a blade of grass in humble existence, find solace only in submission. Gazing upon the sacred favor, I am overwhelmed by the source of such gracious words—how could a mere child fail to comprehend? In presenting this memorial, I inscribe my heart with humility.

I humbly beseech Your August Majesty to deign to heed my plea and perceive the sincerity of this lowly one. May your radiance shine ever brighter, and may your blessings descend in abundance. In nurturing the people, your kindness is like rain and dew, suffusing all. How could my prayers compare? May your glory endure as long as heaven and earth.

**Memorial Congratulating the Auspicious Dawn of the Golden Palace**

We bow before this missive, ascending through the ninefold heavens, bearing honor as the exalted magistrate of Nanchang. On the seventeenth day of the ninth month, joyously coinciding with the descent of the divine upon Mount Song, villages and communities rejoice as one, and the people all celebrate.

Reverently considering the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace Illuminating Dao and Manifesting Virtue Great Immortal, Manifestly Numinous and Universally Beneficent Perfected One—how upright and just, how vast their divine efficacy! They shine alongside sun and moon, partaking in the transformative nurturance of heaven and earth. With fifty-five vows, they pledged to deliver all beings.

Four hundred years and more have seen deeds amassed and conduct refined.
Virtue alone is their aid, and with the Dao they merge as one.
Bestowed upon the ten thousand things, all finds its rightful place;
Set within the four seasons, all follows its proper order.
All receive blessings—who would dare forget such grace?
With the sincerity of tigers bowing, we reverently toast the longevity of the rhinoceros horn cup.
We further pray that the thousand and more households of the Village of Accumulated Goodness all find shelter beneath your vast protection.
May the Great Sage’s reign endure for a hundred million years, its foundations and plans everlasting.
This servant’s heart knows no limit to its longing and devotion.

Moreover, we bow in awe as Mount Song, treasury of auspicious omens and wellspring of heroic talent, brings forth generals and ministers in a felicitous convergence of wind and cloud.
As luminous spirits, they aid the state and shelter the people—this auspicious dawn arrives in the ninth month, its achievements outshining those of the Five Dynasties.
Reverently considering the Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace:
Descended from King Yan, enfeoffed for generations in Qi, his temple has enjoyed five hundred years of grandeur, his honorific titles spanning thirty-two characters.
Divine favor shines brightly, and extraordinary grace descends time and again.
This land of Ao Peak, so rich in geomantic excellence, has seen comets streak across the rainbow isles—thus we raise the rhinoceros horn cup in celebration and feast.
Reflecting on our humble station as stewards of the immortal register, we serve the numinous shrine.
All who dwell beneath heaven’s vast canopy receive its sheltering care.
With gratitude long felt, how shall we repay such blessings in this present hour?
Morning incense and evening lamps ever gaze upon your radiance;
Dawn bells and dusk drums, though meager, strive to offer due reverence.
We do not shrink from the shame of our paltry offerings, hoping only that the divine might deign to descend.
We pray that the Sage on the throne may govern the Central Kingdom for ten thousand years;
That the divine power manifest its efficacy, its exalted honors enduring for a thousand ages.
May palace gates stand solemn and serene, and neighborhoods thrive in peace.

Now, the **Memorial Congratulating the Auspicious Dawn of the Jade Palace**:

We observe how harmony reigns within the palace, solemnity within the temple.
The hundred spirits stand majestic, their voices resounding like rushing waters.
Their numinous presence has guided our sacrifices through many years, enabling this day of prosperity to arrive.
This servant, trembling with awe, bows his head again and again.

We have heard that the great are sagely, and the sagely are divine.
Sincerity takes form, and form becomes manifest.
Their coming knows no bounds, their going leaves no trace.
Seen, they are invisible; heard, they are silent.
Yet in wisdom and uprightness, they move in accord with humanity.
From near to far, from hidden depths to lofty heights, they know the nature of all things.
Heaven and earth unite in their virtue; the four seasons follow their order.
Their fame resounds through the ages, their beneficence bestowed upon the people.
Even for the mulberry and catalpa of one’s homeland, reverence is due—how much more for the sacred offerings of orchid and waterweed?
Reflecting on we, the ritual leaders, who dwell among our fellow villagers as humble scholars:
We rely upon the divine, who speak not of the benefits they confer.
Timely rains and sunshine—even heaven does not defy them, let alone mortals.
The old find peace, the young contentment; the people to this day enjoy their bounty.
Scholars delight in court, farmers in the fields; artisans sing at their work, merchants in the marketplace.
How towering their achievements—how can we repay such virtue?

Thus we encounter this auspicious dawn, when the Jade Palace of the Nine Heavens’ Proclaiming Transformation and Upholding the Dao, the Illustrious and Vastly Beneficent Perfected One, flows with felicitous omens.
The season aligns with the Middle Prime, the moon with the festival of Zhongyuan.
This life may attain the longevity of heaven itself—let the recluse’s retirement wait another day, and the footsteps of King Kang follow eight dynasties hence.
With the mandate renewed, the people ascend to joy, and we celebrate Mount Song’s descent of the divine.
On this day of divine visitation, we join in the ancient rite of Hua’s threefold blessing, offering our sincerest prayers.
The osmanthus moon waxes full, its luster like jade gleaming in the eastern sun.
The immortals of Penglai never age, their radiance linked to the southern pole star.
How could we, witnessing this in person, fail to dance with reverence?
We pray that you may be at our left, at our right, above us—though unseen, you are ever present.
Grant us wealth, grant us longevity, grant us prosperity, from this day forward.

This servant’s heart knows no limit to its longing and devotion.

Moreover, we acknowledge that the sacred is beyond comprehension—this is what we call the divine.
Responsive to devotion, it answers.
The people to this day enjoy its blessings—how could we ever forget?
This day of prosperity has arrived—we dare not invoke the mandate of the Supreme Emperor.
This servant, trembling with awe, bows his head again and again.

We have heard that the formless is the essence of the supreme Dao.
The Yellow Emperor unlocked its gates; the Most High Lord Lao transmitted its lamp and seal.
Virtue without pretense, the marvels of emptiness and stillness—its boundless origin.
The profound beyond the profound, the vast and open—its wondrous workings in the ceaseless generation of life.
It courses through the six directions without pause, governing the ten thousand things without omission.
How towering its achievements—how can we ever name its majesty and power?
Reflecting on this servant’s aspiration to seek the Dao, yet lacking the talent of others:
In presenting these words, I offer the steps of my humble heart, praying that my reverent duty may not defy the august will of heaven, though it be but a foot’s distance away.
Again, we, the ritual leaders, have devoted ourselves to pacifying the divine, invoking blessings through the shrine’s numinous efficacy.
Its fame resounds in illustrious titles, its glory proclaimed in resounding voices.
Harmony reigns within the palace, solemnity within the temple.
Though the mulberry and catalpa of our homeland command reverence, even the humble offerings of orchid and waterweed suffice.
Now, on this morning of Zhongyuan’s gathering of blessings, we celebrate the birth of the Grand Minister.
Heaven and earth bestow their auspices; neighborhoods resound with joy.
This month, at its midpoint, we sing of Mount Song’s birth in the year of Shen.
May his longevity match heaven’s, and our prayers for his long life join the ancient rite of Hua’s threefold blessing.

Thus we encounter the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, Supreme Lord of the Jade Palace:
He sets the model for the ten directions, establishes great deeds across a hundred million kalpas.
No distance is too remote for his illumination—all with blood and breath revere and serve him.
We lay bare our innermost thoughts in supplication.
This servant, a being of dust and impurity, serves with trepidation day and night.
Ashamed of my ignorance and dullness, how dare I claim intimacy with the Most High?
Yet with fasting, purification, and ablutions, I serve the Emperor.
Standing in awe beneath heaven, we call upon the divine—wise, luminous, and upright.
Reverently holding office, we are fortunate to part the clouds and behold the sun, as one who treads thin ice over a deep abyss.
We pray that, though unseen, you may yet be present, ever guiding with your unseen way.
Grant wealth and prosperity, grant venerable age, bestow these gifts upon the people.

This servant’s heart knows no limit to its longing and devotion as we gaze toward heaven and yearn for the sacred.

To the Supreme Primordial and Supreme Perfection Lords,

As the three yang energies usher in prosperity, so too does human endeavor commence. With reverence akin to standing before the two palaces, we trust that the celestial heart may yet be moved. We lay forth our humble wishes, praying for ever-greater abundance of vast blessings.

This servant, trembling with awe, bows his head in prostration. We reverently recall the Nine Heavens’ Two Perfected Lords, descendants of the Lord of Yan, enfeoffed in the land of Qi. Their mighty virtue matches the encompassing power of heaven and earth, and through it they succor the people, extending the blessings of rain and dew. Their divine efficacy is boundless, their uprightness impartial. For four hundred years, their temple sacrifices have endured; their celestial titles span sixteen characters. Who among those who have witnessed their grace would dare fail in reverence?

We humbly pray that you bestow your distant blessings, that we may sing the *rangrang* and *jianjian* odes. Preserve our descendants, that they may extol the *zhezhe* and *shengsheng* virtues.

**Memorial of Prayer for Peace to the Supreme Perfection Lord**

Cold and heat assail us—such are the shallow schemes of petty men. Yet the noble, dwelling in peace, ever contemplate peril and act with foresight. Though we have long offered our prayers, we rely on unseen aid to sustain us.

With gratitude, we declare: Reverently considering the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Aid Perfected Lord, whose virtue matches heaven and earth, whose blessings flow like rain and dew, we behold the radiance of your manifest power and the boundless compassion of your salvific heart. We, your servants, dwell as common folk, gathered in humble abodes. Long sheltered beneath your celestial protection, we dare to turn our sunflower hearts toward you in sincerity. Yet we have failed in cultivation, unaware of our shame.

Mindful of the warning from the trembling neighbor, we value the virtue of aiding those nearby. Thus, in the peace of a shared well, we must guard against one who, falling in, would act only after the fact. To act with caution is to spare future sorrow.

We further pray that rain may fall upon our private fields, yielding abundance—plump grains, sturdy stalks. Bestow upon the people the blessings of longevity, wealth, and well-being.

Moreover, spirits unworthy of sacrifice are those who fail to ward off disaster and repel calamity. Though heaven-sent afflictions may be averted, how dare we delay in observing fasts, upholding precepts, and serving with reverence and trembling awe? Gazing upward at your celestial virtue, we bow in gratitude for the imperial grace that moves the earth.

We, your servants, dwell as neighbors beneath the same trees and mulberries. Ashamed of our ignorance, like those confined to a well, we respectfully unite our community in supplication, for the people’s voice is heard. Once, we heard that even the excesses of one’s own faults could turn away divine wrath. Now, though we may seem as unlearned as children, how could the remedies of great ministers be exhausted? Or perhaps the calculations of the people of Pu have already taken root—some gluttonous as the ravenous Cao Ju, others haughty as Zi Chang. Who would dare claim faultlessness? Yet why not seek omens, that we may know whether fortune or misfortune awaits?

Truly, we have long offered our prayers. If the numinous responds, if it arrives, is this not as it should be? We strive to act rightly, yet fear overstepping in speech. Failing to emulate Yao and Bin, we bear the guilt of falsehood. Heaven’s script and translated talismans are inscribed upon the altar. If omens are ominous, they are deemed portents. The divine brush, following the laws of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, ensures that baleful influences are expelled and falsehoods eradicated. We pray you do not indulge excess, lest it breed suffering—this is our wish, and may the spirits witness it.

Thus, we prostrate ourselves before the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace and Jade Palace Perfected Lords, who are sagely and divine, both civil and martial. When gathered, they manifest their radiant power; when dispersed, they extend their boundless compassion. For a thousand years, their sacrificial rites have been solemn; their sixteen-character titles are grand. Their might shakes the thunder’s wrath, reducing the Five Peaks to dust; their merit rivals the sun and moon, illuminating all directions. They drive pestilent spirits to the mountains’ left and establish defenses to the south of the Red River. The seas and lands are purified, villages and hamlets are at peace. Below, they relieve the suffering of all beings; above, they fulfill the Most High’s compassionate virtue of cherishing life. Though their grace pervades the people’s hearts—even the children who play in the fields—what need have they of imperial power?

We humbly pray that you dispel misfortune, ensuring enduring peace. May each safeguard their well-being, concealing faults and embracing flaws. May right and wrong alike be shielded. We dare not offer the meager gift of water celery, nor presume to speak of the debt repaid by binding grass.

**Memorial from the Villagers to Preserve the Perfected Lord**

We have heard that merit is called the Dao, originating in the boundless beginning—profound and obscure, beyond knowledge or perception, beyond the reach of thought or calculation. Since the Supreme Perfection Sovereign inscribed the purple script, those who study the Dao have been able to trace its source and channel its flow, compiling sacred texts and rituals for the world’s ears and eyes.

Now there is a spirit who takes the observance of fasts and precepts as merit, who vows to deliver the living and ferry the dead. His words align with the sacred canons. All who are talented and virtuous recite them, and their resonance may yet be verified.

We have closely observed the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace Perfected Lord Xu and the Nine Heavens’ Jade Palace Perfected Lord Xu, whose renown spans the world and whose merit resides among the people. Examining their conduct within and their deeds without, we find their very bones and appearance befitting immortals—men of sincere goodness, who have accumulated merit and deeply cherish the Three Treasures. If not for the fortunate convergence of past karma, who could attain such profound understanding of transformation?

Their works—the *Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts for Transformation*, the *Nine Hells Spirit Lamp Rites*, the *Three Realms Purification Rites*, and the *Horse Protection Rites*—all derive from the Most High’s mysterious words. Through careful inquiry and verification, they naturally form chapters. Their numinous verses and chants serve as bridges across the kalpas.

What is called "closing the door and riding the carriage" disregards the passage of years. Beyond these, there are the *Numinous Aid Special Rites*, the *Original Vows Ritual Texts*, and the *Seven Luminaries Lamp Rites*—none of which were composed for personal merit, but rather at the people’s request.

This humble servant’s nature is crude and foolish, and my words are of little weight. Yet in examining affairs and assessing abilities, I recognize my duty. I humbly petition to refine and compile these works into a single collection, which has already been transcribed and presented. By the grace of the Sacred, this servant Xu and others have been appointed to office and elevated to the ranks of immortals. Now, I earnestly hope the Sacred Mercy will grant our request, allowing the ritual canons we have composed to circulate throughout the Three Realms. In every place they reach, let them be reverently followed and implemented. This will not only manifest the boundless salvific power of Numinous Aid but also strengthen our armies and console the hopes of the people in the southeast.

I prostrate myself to await your decree.

*Eulogies of the Numinous* (Volume Two) concludes.
*Eulogies of the Numinous* (Volume Three)
Preface, Memorials, and Postscripts

**Preface to the Ritual Forms of the Perfected Lords**

I have long held that the Dao of Laozi is fully expounded in the *Five Thousand Words*, yet later scholars fail to grasp its entirety due to insufficient study. Only the transmission of the Han Celestial Master preserves its essence, and for over twelve hundred years, its renown has shone across the four directions. From high ministers to humble servants, all who seek longevity and well-being turn their hearts to it in reverence.

Now, manifesting as divine, they are called the Numinous Aid Perfected Lords. Through their numinous vessel, they reveal their power—could this not stem from the lead-and-mercury method bestowed by the Celestial Master in a former life? A single point of pearl-light shines unceasingly. Every character and phrase they compose radiates with literary brilliance.

At first, I heard of this with astonishment, torn between belief and doubt. One day, I came bearing incense to gaze upon their shrine, where I beheld their steles and eulogies—words far beyond the mundane. Doubt gave way to conviction. Yet this book, a single volume, is guarded with utmost care by the local gentry, seldom shown to others. After long entreaty, I finally obtained it. Burning incense, I recited it several times. Its profound meanings are all drawn from the scriptures of the Most High, abstruse yet luminous, perfectly aligned with the Dao. The hidden hymns of the heavens resound in harmony. Their salvific power vows to embrace the seas and mountains. The divine mechanism is wondrous, now concealed, now revealed—how could shallow learning or limited wisdom presume to discuss it?

Yet while the divine is made manifest through the Perfected Lords, I have repeatedly wished to compose a preface or postscript, fearing that scholars might dismiss it as superfluous. As for the virtue of the Perfected Lords, it shines like the sun and moon; surely a sage will one day write their preface. I merely sketch its broad outlines here.

Written in the thirtieth year of the Zhengyuan era, by Ouyang Gongzhu, Assistant Instructor of the Lu Academy, on the eve of the Lantern Festival.

**Preface to the Vows of the Perfected Lords**

The vow is the vow of the Perfected Lords, and it is also the vow of all people. Each bow and prostration expresses the sincerity of the heart. Sincerity of heart is the perfection of goodness. The goodness inherent in human nature is like water flowing downward. To fail to correct one’s faults—this is my concern. This concern is why the vow exists: to cultivate goodness.

Is this merely about the text of the vow? Gazing upward at the heavens, one finds the number twenty-five. Looking downward at the earth, one finds the number thirty. Combined, they yield fifty-five. It is through this number that the vow is fulfilled. If not for working in harmony with heaven and earth, how could this be achieved?

Goodness is the guiding principle of heaven and earth. Even the slightest trace of deceit, arrogance, or negligence—this is not the vow I speak of. How could it be equated with true goodness? As the *Tradition* says: "Goodness has no fixed master; it aligns with unity." There is no other way. Begin with it, end with it, and do not halt midway—only then is it perfectly good and perfectly beautiful.

Goodness is the foundation of fortune, and fortune is the accumulation of goodness. Tang Gao Yu once said: "Accumulate goodness to attain fortune; do not expend wealth to seek fortune." If fortune can be sought without expending wealth, can one who cultivates goodness be said to expend wealth? When you see goodness, share it; when you hear of goodness, proclaim it. All who share this aspiration should encourage one another, so that we may stand without shame before heaven and earth—and before the Perfected Lords. This, too, is the great vow of the Perfected Lords.

**Memorial for the Restoration of the Numinous Aid Palace**

According to the *History of the Five Dynasties: House of Huainan*, Prince Qi of Xu had two sons, the Prince of Jiang and the Prince of Yu—now the Golden Palace and Jade Palace Perfected Lords. The Perfected Lords were always skilled in literary composition, their numinous responses swift and efficacious. The people of the southeast have relied on their protection, far beyond the aid of Cao Gui.

In the *gengyin* year of the Yongle era, a great drought struck, deeply troubling the regional officials. Only the Perfected Lords manifested their power by bringing timely rain, a singular demonstration of their efficacy. Officials and commoners alike agreed that the temple’s dilapidated state demanded restoration, to honor the divine grace of the Perfected Lords. I respectfully submit this brief memorial, knocking at the gates of the great, wielding my brush to invoke blessings.

They abandoned office to become immortals, their literary legacy illuminating the jade registers of heaven. They halted troops and quelled bandits, their incense and offerings securing the golden turtle for ten thousand years. The sweet pear tree evokes the memory of the Duke of Shao; the magic fungus flourishes in the ancestral courtyard. Raise high the gates, expand the halls—dimly resembling the embroidered peaks. Before the palace, reverence lingers as if the Perfected Lords were present, their majesty radiant.

Beyond the brocade-clad city, clouds and mist curl lazily around the jade windows, where sun and moon pass in tranquility. Approaching the golden palace, wondrous omens gather, fostering the vitality of long life. Blessings and prosperity flow abundantly, as the virtuous lords of the realm flourish. They are the pillars of the great realm, the scales of far and near. Seeking fortune and avoiding misfortune, they consult the treasure scrolls and jade texts of heaven. Praising goodness and reproving evil, they traverse the world as golden brothers and jade kin.

Amid the turning seasons, they ever hasten past the courtyard in reverence; frost and dew mourn the nearness of the immortal isles. At the celestial court, the favored ministers receive divine prescriptions, tasting the elixirs and remedies first. In the maritime lands, the people rejoice at timely rains, and withered seedlings ripen early.

Moss traces reappear, creeping into the curtains with verdant hues, half-encroaching upon the paths of footsteps; the wind stirs the green tiles. With hands that mend the heavens, they reconstruct new eaves, while rain washes the crumbling walls to lay fresh foundations. Yet adhering to old customs, they fail to rouse the unyielding courage of former days—how then may they achieve the unparalleled feat? Were the mighty brush not ceaselessly to inscribe it, the towering palace walls would rise in but a moment.

To the left, the Bei Brook; to the right, the Lai River—beyond, the Purple Terrace lies but a footstep from the immortals’ source. Before, a jade table; behind, the soaring *feilong*—the literary brush thrusts high as the Oxherd and Weaver stars. When one man enjoys felicity, ten thousand states share in prosperity.

Respectfully inscribed.

Composed by Lin Hanmeng of Boling.

*Two Postscripts by Immortal Xu Xianhao*

When a noble man encounters an age governed by principle, he composes literature to advance his aspirations, thereby enacting the Dao—this is no mere fortune, but what is fitting. The world may indeed be ordered through wisdom and effort; those who aspire to the Dao and seek efficacy in their time through literature must align with the gates of the worthy. To embrace uncut jade at Mount Jing is not misfortune—it, too, is fitting.

Yet how can the numinous be deemed ordinary in the dim and fragrant obscurity? That literature should startle and move people—is this not strange? The *Collected Works of Immortal Xu Xianhao*—comprising records, eulogies, rhapsodies, and odes—forms a vast compendium. Its words, carefully weighed and never excessive, all offer critiques that challenge the age. Though the realms of the hidden and manifest are sundered, one cannot escape the burdens of convention, and thus confusion lingers.

In my humble view, the noble men of this land, though devoted to the Dao and living in an age of principle, find their Way fitting yet their aspirations thwarted. Thus, they borrow literature to lend their teachings a numinous aura. In the moment of wielding the brush, is there truly no exertion of force? Whether man or spirit, I dare not presume to know. Were it so, the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture* would have emerged solely from Fuxi and Yu the Great.

Therefore, I refrain from binding these words to any doctrine and instead append them to the postscripts of the esteemed.

---

Moreover, spirits rely on men to take form, just as men rely on spirits to achieve completion. In the intercourse between man and spirit, every word and utterance is literature. Does literature embody the spirit, or does the spirit embody the man? The *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture* seem to border on the uncanny. Though Fuxi and Yu, those great sages, validated and trusted them, how could the dull-witted masses of later ages not doubt and perplex?

Reading these works through the lens of spirit-human exchange and examining their words, one finds that all align with the hearts of sages and worthies. Ritual, law, punishment, and governance are as clear as the palm of one’s hand—why then this urgent concern for the people’s welfare? Spirit or man, who could fail to doubt and perplex?

The notion that fish and dragons aid wind and rain is but a reflection of human sentiment. Thus, I say: sincerity illumines, though it resides in the numinous, its realization lies with man. If even a single matter remains unresolved or a single phrase unformed, though one might borrow another’s voice, I know not how it could suffice.

In the moment of wielding the brush, I cannot shirk my duty. Should the grand tones of *huangzhong* and *dalü* fall silent while earthen pots clamor, such a world would shame the spirits. The *Collected Works of Immortal Xu Xianhao*, being the literary corpus of the numinous, has already spread widely—how could I not treasure it as jade and preserve it?

*Inscribed Text for the Imperial Placard of the Upper Numinous Aid Palace*

We humbly observe: the Dragon’s Head soars, the Turtle Peak stands majestic. The red dust transforms into brocade, beautifully arraying the altar grounds; the azure cloth unfurls like a net, fulfilling prophetic omens. A cluster of human habitation gathers, convening for a thousand years. The temple halls stand solemn, their frescoes renewed, their scale magnificent.

We reverently recall the True Man of Numinous Aid, whose divine power is vast, whose integrity and wisdom shine. The incense fire thrives, and his deeds manifest miracles. Recently, his transforming brush has flourished with literary grace. Through these allegories, he exhorts with ritual and righteousness. The erection of steles and inscriptions has made his merits and virtues resplendent.

Once, he received the honor of an imperial placard; now, he is granted the grandeur of celestial investiture. His name is inscribed in the immortal registers, his rank listed among the celestial ranks. His commendations are extraordinary, his favor and glory profound.

At this time, we encounter the Grand Steward, an official of the fourth rank, whose blessings shelter the Three Mountains. Possessing the ability of the Duke of Zhou to serve ghosts and spirits, and the insight of Confucius to illuminate the rites of suburban and ancestral sacrifices, he has examined the sacrificial canons and bestowed a palace name.

The brush wields strokes vast as rafters, the characters loom large as pecks—transforming mountains and rivers, vying in splendor with sun and moon. Villages and hamlets gleam resplendent; scholars and common folk rejoice in delight.

A poem declares:
*By celestial decree, Lingji ascends as true immortal,*
*Blessing our living souls, moved by both heavens.*
*The inscribed plaque shines bright, its characters vast as pecks,*
*The palace gates stand grand for ten thousand years.*

We humbly pray that after the golden placard is hung, customs shall flourish in purity, and villages thrive in loyalty and beauty. Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants shall share in its blessings; rain and sunshine, cold and heat shall align with the seasons. Year after year, harvests shall be bountiful; person after person, all shall know prosperity.

We further hope for the imperial bestowal of an eight-character edict plaque, its golden script ensuring the fragrant incense of worship shall endure for ten thousand years. Year upon year, we shall offer prayers for the Emperor’s longevity—*ten thousand years, ten thousand years, ten thousand myriad years!*

**Imperial Edict Plaque for the Hall of Harmonious Kinship**
We humbly observe that the Hall of Harmonious Kinship, established to instruct in human ethics, bears a grand plaque with characters radiant in splendor. Now, customs return to purity, and for all ages, this shall be known as the village of accumulated goodness.

We reverently honor the True Lord Lingji, upright and wise. In the palace, harmony reigns; in the temple, solemnity prevails. Flanking him, attendants stand in awe; his glory resounds, his spirit shines bright. Eight characters proclaim his imperial investiture, a sacred trace enduring a thousand years. With these hands renewed, this hall is built. The people gaze upon it, their bearing reverent and weighty. From this day forth, customs grow pure; the hearts of filial piety and brotherly love arise naturally.

We humbly pray that after the plaque is hung, high and low shall live in harmony, the young shall know their place, and the old their order. Villages shall know peace, the elderly shall be at ease, and the young shall be cherished.

A poem declares:
*The heavenly principles of the Three Bonds and Five Constants*
*Instruct the people in kinship, and this hall is built.*
*If you, the people, serve thus in return,*
*One day, your gates shall bear the banner of filial piety and brotherly love.*

**Imperial Edict Plaque for the Hall of Joyous Feasting**
We humbly observe that the sacred temple gleams with divine radiance, its attendants standing in solemn array, its paintings freshly adorned. Guarding the eastern realm, it brings longevity and wealth; the Lord of Lu named it the Hall of Joyous Feasting.

We reverently honor the True Lord Lingji, whose temple stands in solemn harmony, whose spirit manifests in glory. The imperial edict plaque bears eight golden characters; the rear palace houses three thousand beauties. With wings and awe, he responds to every prayer, bestowing all blessings. Though the rites of sacrifice were few, auspicious dreams followed, and the wish for a son was granted. The gates stand grand, the plaque shines resplendent.

We humbly pray that after the plaque is hung, your descendants shall flourish, inheriting the virtue of the *Zhongsi*. May your posterity be everlasting, and the songs of joy and intoxication be sung.

A poem declares:
*The lofty peak of Ao stands tall, its divine essence released,*
*Blue cloth forms a net—its signs are clear and true.*
*At this moment, Confucius himself carried the child forth,*
*And the august spirit descended, granting the wish at last.*

**Memorial of Sincere Gratitude for Rain**
The villagers, Huang Yuan and others, deeply concerned that summer has brought no rain, seek to dispel the drought demon and avert disaster. The divine descends from the heavenly court.

We prostrate ourselves before the true immortal, bathing thrice in fragrant incense, offering prayers and supplications. On the eighteenth day of the fifth month, with sincere hearts, we reverently invited the Daoist assembly to beseech the gracious True Lord Lingji. Proceeding to the Dragon’s Gorge Pool at Ao Peak, we welcomed the sacred water. By noon, it was enshrined in the palace, and soon after, clouds gathered in the southwest. By the *wei* hour, rain fell. That night, the ritual altar was opened, and the rites were performed according to the canons. A grand purification offering was made to the Dragon King, and a hundred prostrations were offered in the *Chant of Heavenly Repentance*.

That night, sweet rain poured in abundance. By the twentieth day, heavy rains drenched the fields, filling the furrows to satisfaction. In profound gratitude, we extend our thanks. We have invited the assembled immortals to conduct another purification offering to the Dragon King, the Field Deities, and all spirits. We pray to the Southern Dipper and Northern Dipper, lighting lamps for the constellations, and perform the ritual at dawn to repay the True Lord.

We present humble offerings, completing the rites in full, and hold a purification feast to express our gratitude. We humbly pray for continued blessings—may sunshine and rain align with the great harmony of heaven and earth. May the harvests be as abundant as millet stacks and grain beams, bringing the auspicious fruition of all crops. We trust in the boundless virtue of the Ninefold Imperial Court, spreading prosperity to the eight directions. May the songs of joy resound like the *Striking the Earth* hymn, and may all things flourish in pairs. May the Sacred Lifespan equal that of heaven, enduring for ten thousand myriad years. May all living things thrive in harmony, and the realm know eternal peace and prosperity.

These words convey our deepest reverence, our hearts brimming with fervent devotion.

*Thus concludes Volume Three of the* Hymns in Praise of the Divine.
*Volume Four of the* Hymns in Praise of the Divine *begins.*

**Poem to the Supreme Perfection**

**By Zhao Di of Baihu**

To the south of Fangshan stands an ancient divine shrine, traditionally held to be the abode of the brothers Xu Zhiyu of the Five Dynasties, known as the Golden Portal and Jade Portal—Two Perfected Ones. These Perfected Ones, scions of divine luminaries, have passed nearly five centuries. Yet their spirits, still in heaven, have not forsaken our people: in times of drought or deluge, pestilence or plague, prayers to them are swiftly answered.

Though I, Di, am unworthy, I wished to bow before their shrine and offer supplication. Thus, I composed these *Step-in-Void Hymns* in their honor.

**I**
The Sage is a scion of divine luminaries,
Whose spirit roams the Supreme Nethermost.
Crimson tablets ascend through purple clouds,
Jade canopies link the azure vaults.
Their radiance knows no dusk nor dawn,
In purity and emptiness, how resplendent they gleam.
Auspicious qi drifts from the Jade Grotto,
Rosy hues adorn the crimson forest’s edge.
This morning, they descend in solemn majesty,
Phoenix banners trailing in ethereal grace.
They attend to us, the folk of this realm,
Dispelling our entanglements and strife.

**II**
How lofty the jade palace,
Its heights brushing the verdant peaks.
A heroic aura, divine through a hundred generations,
Their numinous light gleams through the four seasons.
Dignified in bearing, ever august,
The temple’s visage commands reverence.
In the azure hall, incense smoke hangs cold,
Beneath the white sun, the rafters chill with cloud.
How frail this mortal frame,
How may it reach such divine splendor?

**III**
How gracefully the feathered canopy sways,
As sacred vapors descend from the cinnabar gates.
The faint strains of phoenix song drift,
Cool autumn breezes scatter through the grove.
Jade nectar flows in purple clouds,
Divine auroras waft with crimson tablets.
Feathered robes sink beyond the stars,
Celestial music fades in empty air.
The Great Void, so vast and still,
Swiftly they vanish into rosy mist.
Only the *Step-in-Void* hymn lingers,
Beneath the moonlit peach blossoms.

**IV**
Like flowering branches of jade, entwined,
By imperial decree, they govern our land.
When the yin winds arise,
A refreshing breeze brings sacred rain.
Pestilence yields to their divine grace,
Famine is averted by their numinous shield.
In the unseen workings of the loom,
Their providence shines bright and clear.
High in the Supreme Nethermost Heaven,
Their radiance graces the Palace of Pure Emptiness.
Jade pendants adorn their rosy robes,
Feathered canopies trace the clouded paths.
Coldly they ride the endless wind,
Ascending to pay homage at the Purple Mists.

**Twelve Hymns at the Lingji Palace**

**By Yang Jingheng, Left Assistant Director of the Ministry of War**

By imperial command, the Perfected One Zhang of the Supreme Clarity performed the *Yanxi* Offering at Lingji Palace. I composed this to commemorate the auspicious gathering.

The rivers and mountains proclaim their numinous might as the grand fortune unfolds,
From the Supreme Clarity descends the immortal guest, bearing incense.
The celestial altar’s rites commence beneath clouded banners,
Feathered regalia hasten to the moonlit halls and return.
This blessed assembly delights in ascending the sacred precinct,
Though weak currents may yet separate us from Penglai.
I pray the wind may lend me a crane from the Jasper Terrace,
To soar and bestow boundless blessings across the nine realms.

**By the Same Author**

Verdant peaks soar to meet the Turtle Peak,
The Purple Palace’s heights chill the vast heavens.
The cinnabar crucible’s glow illumines a thousand peaks beneath the moon,
The Jade Terrace’s fragrance drifts on winds through a hundred flowers.
Their divine power blazes, revealing numinous favor,
The Emperor’s virtue, exalted, bestows titles upon them.
In what year was this palace granted?
When the Perfected One was enfeoffed, he passed beyond the white clouds.

**By Peng Shen of Gusu, Right Assistant Director**

Flower-laden fragrant chariots harness purple simurghs,
The flute’s melody descends from the rainbowed clouds.
The stars of the nine heavens float above the mountain temple,
Through five watches, wind and thunder encircle the stone altar.
Immortal fruits weigh down the branches—cinnabar lychees ripen,
Cool shade fills the courtyard where emerald wutong trees stand cold.
Their divine power, resplendent, brings manifold blessings,
Forever aiding the imperial realm to endure in eternal peace.

**By Li Ye, Right Assistant Director**

Stealing a moment from official duties, I pay homage at the divine palace,
Where stone paths wind through misty streams.
A pair of crows beyond the window cry in the white daylight,
A profusion of blossoms along the steps unfurl in spring’s crimson.
Wielding the tally, they bear princely rank in this age,
Warding off calamity, their martial deeds shall be recorded in time.
The numinous shrine bestows grace upon this land,
Its glory shall endure, its offerings unceasing.

**By Zhou Chang of Fengyang, Surveillance Commissioner**

Twice a year I come to the immortal palace,
Planting apricot trees, my heart sincere in gratitude.
Wondrous medicines heal chronic ailments,
Sacred talismans revive the weary and infirm.
At the grotto’s mouth, flowers frame the quest for the true deer,
On the peak’s waist, rain obscures the dragon’s dharma discourse.
Inscribed steles proclaim the imperial robes and blood offerings,
Ennobled with titles, the sacred grace soars high.

**By Qian Shu of Shaoxing, Left Assistant Director**

Briefly halting my warhorse, I ascend Ao Peak,
Bowing again, I recall the brothers’ merits.
In days past, they quelled strife with blades,
For a thousand years, their temple has known autumn and winter offerings.
Verses composed in prayer bear wondrous efficacy,
The numinous aid of Lingji earns grand enfeoffment.
Their divine power, vast, shields the nation and shelters the people,
Timely rains and sunshine bring blessings in due measure.

**By Zeng Ji of Sanshan, Supervising Secretary of the Ministry of War**

Once I led the celestial troops across the Xiang River,
A million fierce warriors surrendered at a glance.
The Golden Ao’s blood offerings were not in vain,
The Jade Portal’s cinnabar decrees came in pairs.
Swords and pendants stood in solemn array, clouds swirling,
Pavilions and terraces rose in layered stone grandeur.
Their heroic names endure through past and present,
And their mighty writings crown the seas and lands.

**By Yang Ningyuan of Xiujiang, Vice Director of the Ministry of Revenue**

Mountains green and waters fair respond to the mysterious workings,
Heaven bestowed worthy guardians to watch over the islets.
From dawn to dusk, they discern fortune and misfortune,
Judging right and wrong with the precision of a hair’s breadth.
The ancient shrine stands beyond the Three Mountains,
Its numinous favor spreads, known across the four seas.
The royal scions, ethereal, entered the immortal registers,
Their fragrant legacy is truly rare in this world.

**By Zhu Chun of Shanyin, Supervising Secretary of the Ministry of Justice**

Reverently bearing the jade tally, I traversed the southern lands of Min.
Passing Ao Peak, I visited the Lingji Palace of vast grace, gazing and bowing.
As the rites concluded, the temple officials, leading three or five youths in feathered robes and crane cloaks,
Invited me to the Chrysanthemum Pavilion.
Over tea, in idle conversation, they requested a poem to mark my reverent visit.
Thus, I hastily composed a few verses to glimpse but a fraction of the sacred dynasty’s divine majesty.
May later scholars correct my humble offering—how fortunate that would be.

Reverently bearing the imperial tally to southern Min,
I halted my carriage to pay homage to the Two Perfected Ones.
The temple’s halls rise a thousand fathoms in solemn grandeur,
Their brocade robes gleam anew through the four seasons.
Jasper steles record their deeds, descending from heaven,
Jade ornaments radiate light, illuminating the seashores.

The rites flourish in this prosperous age,
May they endure with the altars of state for ten thousand springs.

**—Meng Shi of Pei County, Minister of the Ministry of Revenue**

In the mid-winter of the *renzi* year of Xuande (1432), I received the imperial command to oversee affairs in Fujian. Passing by Golden Ao Peak, I wished to pay homage at the newly radiant Lingji Palace. Truly, the Two Perfected Ones were both loyal and filial, their merits extending to the altars of state and their blessings bestowed upon the people. Moreover, they mastered the turning of transformative *qi*, greatly manifesting divine favor to protect the sacred person of the emperor. Thus, it is fitting to bestow upon them honorific titles and ensure their eternal veneration, that the divine protection may abide. All this stems from the supreme benevolence and profound love of the sagely Son of Heaven. That Heaven and Earth endure together is no mere coincidence.

I bowed deeply and kowtowed, then composed this poem:

Once in the annals of history I saw heroes,
Brothers of one heart who built great merit.
In life they together fulfilled filial piety,
And in death, know they still offered loyalty.
On clear nights, propitious dreams confirm the illustrious age,
With rare elixirs from Red Stone, the emperor’s health is restored.
The temple’s majesty upholds solemn rites,
And for a thousand ages, the people revere their lofty virtue.

**—Yang Zheng of Jishui, Surveillance Commissioner**

Elder and younger brothers, side by side, preserved the great Perfected,
In life ennobled with royal titles, in death revered as gods.
Their distant transmissions of esoteric writs conveyed alchemical secrets,
Their extraordinary merits moved the imperial court.
The immortal register bestows grand honors,
At Ao Peak, the solemn rites renew in splendor.
Incense clouds drift beyond the banyan’s shade,
Where sacrificial offerings endure year after year.

**—Chai Shan, Eunuch Envoy to the Lands of Fusang and Others**

Charged with command, I led troops to the frontiers,
Where distant lands above revere the One, and below fulfill their duties.
I tarried in the Three Mountains,
Long favored by the wondrous presence here.
Now, with reverence, I hold the embroidered banners,
Extolling the sacred titles,
To invoke blessings for the voyages to and from Huai and the seas.
May the gods deign to accept,
As rites are solemnly observed.
In this hallowed retreat, moved by the scene,
I gathered my thoughts to praise the divine virtue.
May later readers find refinement in these words.

Southern Min abounds with wondrous peaks,
Where Dongting and Taihua mountains intertwine.
Where true dragons once concealed their sacred traces,
Floating radiance and layered verdure fill the ridges.
The Perfected Ones, in mystery both hidden and manifest,
Silently turn the celestial mechanisms to spread divine power.
Above, with elixirs they guard the emperor’s person,
Below, with vast grace they shelter the people’s hardships.
I have heard how brothers, equally filial and reverent,
Exhausted their loyalty through five dynasties, surpassing all heroes.
In life, renowned ministers; in death, enshrined and venerated,
Their manifest blessings and wondrous deeds shall know no end.
The temple’s awe-inspiring majesty is unmatched in the world,
As it presides over the eight thousand *li* of Jiangnan.
When the five-colored clouds disperse, the golden Ao is revealed,
Pouring forth the Dragon Spring’s pure waters.

At that time, entrusted with a mission to distant lands,
I came here in utmost sincerity to offer this hymn of eternal spirit.
I saw only the quiet birds conversing on the moss,
And blossoms, slick with wind, filling the valleys.
Have you not seen the purity of Wuling’s landscapes?
At Fan’s mouth, where rivers and mountains are most serene.
To glimpse such clarity—what cares might dissolve?
Here, in this moment, all is vivid and near.
Entering the immortals’ path beneath the embroidered banners,
A single soaring peak welcomes them.
Carriages and horses arrive from the empty sky at times,
While jade pendants chime in the nine heavens as a pair.
The azure birds sing as the wind sighs in the sacred precincts,
This realm’s purity shall not come again.
Though I offer my sincerest devotion, lacking even a cup of wine,
I pray the incense smoke may never fade,
And endure as long as Heaven and Earth.

**—Guo Jingfu of Bai Lake, *Spending the Night at Lingji Palace***

Together we reach the Perfected Ones’ realm,
In the bamboo lodge beyond, the fast is pure.
Dreams return to the lone island’s moon,
Cold seeps into my robe like frost.
The night’s *qi* stirs the divine Ao,
Autumn’s sounds carry the soaring auspicious crane.
I rise and dress, sleepless once more,
As the ethereal mist reveals the celestial fragrance.

**—Guo Yi of Bai Lake, *Ten Marvelous Peaks: Golden Ao Peak***

The golden Ao came from the sea,
Its extraordinary beauty infused with numinous essence.
It seems a coiled azure dragon,
Soaring amidst the radiant clouds.
The cassia halls float in cinnabar light,
The lingzhi chambers conceal immortal mysteries.
At times, I gaze upon the returning crane’s chariot,
As celestial fragrance suffuses the misty verdure.

**—Li Shuyi of Longxi, *Golden Ao Peak***

A speck of gold floated up from the sea,
Forming a cinnabar cavern amid the clouded woods.
The gods claimed this land of concentrated numinosity,
Spreading true *qi* through all ages.

**—Guo Yi of Bai Lake, *White Deer Peak***

White Deer Peak, its verdure piled like jade,
The deer followed the clouds, never to return.
Even now, on the path by the stream’s scattered stones,
I imagine their tracks lingering on the green moss.

**—Li Shuyi of Longxi, *White Deer Peak***

The immortal deer, bearing flowers, passed this way,
Opening a Chan temple in the cliffs’ secluded nook.
The green mountains remain unchanged, their name enduring,
Ever inspiring the forest monks’ joyful verses.

**—Guo Yi of Bai Lake, *Brush Peak***

This mountain soars into the azure void,
Three divine peaks stand in sharp relief.
Flying verdure cascades like a dragon’s pool,
Still holding the inkstone’s waters.
Clouds welcome the returning brush formations,
Stars encircle the rising glow.
May the divine mechanism unfold,
Ever offering tribute to the enlightened ruler.

**—Li Shuyi of Longxi, *Brush Peak***

Its dynamic force, solitary and towering, pierces the emerald haze,
From afar, it seems to paint the mist and clouds.
After the banished immortal’s dream ended in spring’s breeze,
Who knows how many times the flowers have bloomed on its summit?

**—Guo Yi of Bai Lake, *Lotus Peak***

To the south, Lotus Peak rises a myriad fathoms in autumn,
The pure depths of Jade Well float with auspicious light.
I know that each night where the fragrance drifts,
It scatters into the twelve jade towers of the immortals.

**—Li Shuyi of Longxi, *Lotus Peak***

The Jade Well’s roots transplanted to the emerald ridges,
Standing tall and solitary above the clouds.
When the Perfected Ones gather the jade blossoms,
It all seems like the Jade Pool after the immortals’ feast.

**—Guo Yi of Bai Lake, *Flying Peng Peak***

Beyond the world’s Penglai, this peak,
Its beauty and grandeur adorned with jade-like plants.
It flew forth from the Three Spirits,
Amidst these ten marvels.
Heaven opens the White Jade Pot,
Night illuminates the cinnabar flames.
If immortals may be sought,
I shall part the clouds to seek their hidden depths.

**—Li Shuyi of Longxi, *Flying Peng Peak***

From the sea of islands, which peak flew here?
At its summit, the sunlit jade lotus stands sharp and clear.

**Seeking the Dao’s Immortals**

The immortals’ guests delight in pure contemplation,
Ascending the cinnabar steps to trace the cranes’ tracks.

**Greedy Wolf Peak**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*
Its radiance at the Dipper’s edge—unclimbable,
Yet in what year did it rise, verdant, to stand among men?
Once atop the golden turtle, gazing afar,
It still resembles Penglai—yet which mountain of that isle?

**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**
Peaks cluster on all sides like painted screens,
Their perilous heights soaring straight into the azure void.
At times, in the still night, a crimson glow blazes,
A single radiant beam piercing the Dipper’s stars.

**Square Rock Peak**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*
Square Rock beside Kongtong,
Its divine beauty fit to grasp.
Gazing, it seems a dark leopard crouched,
Its reflection inverted in the limpid river’s jade.
Above dwells an elder who feeds on lingzhi,
Chanting long songs upon the mossy stones.
You, too, should brush the dust from your robes,
And daily wander with the white clouds.

**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**
Its summit, sheer as if cleaved by the sky,
The cranes’ path to immortality—spotless, without moss.
The celestial winds blow down the hanging cliff’s waterfall,
Scattering into midnight thunder upon the crags.

**Purple Terrace Peak**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*
Emerald cliffs and cinnabar crags meet the lofty terrace,
As spring deepens, misty purple clouds amass.
Who plays the jade flute beneath the terrace’s moon?
It must herald the return of the turtle-peak’s crane-borne chariot.

**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**
Purple qi swirls, unbrushed and impenetrable,
Its perilous base thrust forth, carved by heaven itself.
The jade pendants’ chime falls before the terrace’s moon—
Surely immortals ride the cranes to descend.

**Ancient City Peak**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*
How many households remain in the ancient city?
The mountain stands empty, few traces of the past.
Mossy paths—no dust of fragrance,
Smoky cliffs gather the cold’s hue.
Wind chimes through pines and cassia by the pool,
Moonlight climbs the vines and rocks.
Do not heed the crows’ night cries—
They stir memories of bygone days.

**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**
Emerald cliffs and cinnabar crags—uneven the path,
Yet travelers still speak of the ancient city’s name.
Wind and spring daily deliver their clear, cool melody,
Unaccompanied by the plum blossoms’ iron flute.

**Great Peace Peak**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*
The jade candle’s glow descends from the nine heavens,
A thousand peaks and ten thousand valleys carry the cloud-borne song.
Who joins in singing the *Great Peace*?
Best to ascend the golden turtle’s hundred-foot bridge.

**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**
The scene of Great Peace—boundless and vast,
Half veiled among these famed mountains’ finest.
Grateful that the spirits nest here in peace,
Shaded cliffs and trees bathed in the wind of benevolence.

**Forty Poems from the *Eight Immortals’ Odes to the True Immortals***

**Turtle-Peak Immortal Palace**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*
Divine favor shines upon the immortal realm,
Heavenly incense fills the embroidered robes.
Flowers welcome the twin phoenixes,
Mountains embrace the golden turtle.
Osmanthus gates rise to the clouds,
Lingzhi altars hang high beneath the moon.
The divine mechanism encompasses the cosmos,
Brush and ink send forth waves and billows.
Jade caves face the morning herbs,
Jasper terraces—Queen Mother’s peaches.
Behold the vaulted stele’s myriad characters,
Ancient imperial decrees bestow praise.

**—Diaotai, Li Pu**
At dawn, the golden turtle’s summit,
Lofty and towering—thousands of *ren* high.
Since the Two Modes divided,
It has not stood beside the Jun Peak.
The sagely court venerates the True Palace,
Its splendor linked with the flower calyx’s radiance.
The divine mechanism reaches the nine heavens,
Auspicious verses descend in double blessing.
Cloud forests conceal celestial fragrance,
Wind and springs mingle with immortal chimes.
How could one draw near this pure essence,
To wash away the dust of mortal nature?

**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**
Jade halls rise from the central peak,
The golden turtle guards the distant earth.
Divine light merges with the heavens,
Imperial favor arrives from the sun’s edge.
Cinnabar phoenixes tread upon jasper grasses,
Azure youths present feathered cups.
Beyond the dusty world’s bounds,
Its auspicious qi surpasses Penglai.

**—Qingmen, Shao Tong**
Twin gates tower, far from worldly dust,
Empty fragrance and floating verdure—sunlit haze.
Pendants return beneath the moon’s distant glow on the golden turtle’s peak,
Music stirs the clouds, following the white cranes’ flock.
Brush and ink bathe in the nine heavens’ new favor,
Robes and crowns bear the Five Dynasties’ rare merit.
Gazing afar at the flower calyx’s radiant glow,
A thousand years of divine light yield wondrous fragrance.

**—Changle, Chen Tang**
Jade palaces mark the finest scenes,
The turtle’s back—stone firm and steadfast.
In times of peace, the divine and numinous manifest,
Mountains encircle it, its qi majestic and high.
Night’s glow rises from the shell-gate,
Spring’s hues intoxicate the immortals’ peaches.
Peerless since ancient times, talents surpass,
Honored with seals and bathed in imperial favor.

**Dragon Pool Flying Waterfall**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*
Rain gathers over the immortal’s summit,
Flying torrents bear the ancient pool’s waters.
At night, the twin streams’ descent is heard,
By dawn, they merge into a single brook.
Reflections invert the Silver River at dusk,
Voices hang in the azure sky of autumn.
High-dwelling cranes startle from their dreams,
Mysterious rainbows rise from hidden depths.
Distant echoes—sparse bell tones,
One might mistake them for drifting white silk.
At Turtle Peak’s clear listening post,
The moon lingers in the *Step-in-Void* tower.

**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**
The numinous pool, drenched by night’s rain,
The flying waterfall pours from the bright river.
Clearing skies polish the ice-like mirror,
Cold sounds emerge from the creeping fig.
Scattered pines startle the cranes’ dreams,
Winding shores carry the fishermen’s songs.
Beware the moon at the stream’s edge—
How many times have true immortals passed here?

**—Diaotai, Li Pu**
Behold the Six Harmonies’ transformative work—
Carved by heaven’s craft, winding and vast.
The hibernating spirit’s qi,
The pool’s secrets,
The Primordial’s Silver River descends from the sky’s edge.
A thousand-foot rainbow hangs inverted,
Above, it joins the Milky Way,
Below, it flows into the river’s course.
Cool shadows, beauty,
New moon’s chill,
Voices echo in the sparse wind—true immortals.
At dawn, they offer libations and sing pure odes,
Who could share in this?

**—Qingmen, Shao Tong**
After the fresh rain, the numinous pool’s leisurely mood abounds,
A hundred-foot flying torrent spills from the celestial river.
Soaring through clouds, it seems to trail jade silk,
Beneath the moon, one might mistake it for scattered jade pendants.
Suddenly, it stirs the depths of the hidden pool’s listening,
Then startles the wild geese flying past the sun’s edge.
At dawn, ascending the golden turtle to gaze,
It scatters into Penglai’s jade-green sea waves.

**—Changle, Chen Tang**
A thousand-foot cold torrent descends the cloud ladder,
As if the jasper vault exhales a white rainbow.

Marvelous words meander, spreading sacred grace,
Washing the world of mortals clean of mundane filth.

**Bamboo Cliff After Snow** — *Baihu, Guo Yi*
Ten thousand stalks ascend sheer cliffs,
Six-petaled blooms gleam on thawing ice.
Their hue borrows the luster of Wu salt,
Their light slants like Jiang’s winding path.
Fit for soaring auspicious cranes,
Or the serene silence of spirit crows.
Beyond the red dust’s fragrance,
A thousand fathoms of jade-green plumes enfold.
The people of Ying sing of white snow,
The immortal’s furnace chills cinnabar.
Yet near the lofty perfected realm,
Pure fragrance rises like the *ditihua*.

**—Diaotai, Ji Pu**
Dimly, the true ones nest in hidden crags,
Where piled snow seals deep seclusion.
Frost-bound bamboo stays unopened,
A thousand groves lose their verdant hue.
Sunlight congeals in pristine splendor,
The first day of winter startles with a cold gust.
Six-petaled flakes rejoice in shared clouds,
Their color heralds a year of abundance.
The immortals’ twelve towers,
Face each other in jasper and jade.
A single *buxu* hymn,
Rings crisp as shattering jade.

**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**
Before the cliff, clouds begin to gather,
Beyond the bamboo, snow first dries.
Dawn’s distant terrace gleams,
Low mist chills emerald sleeves.
Luminous as mica curtains,
Scattered like crystal platters.
Deeply ashamed of my meager dust-bound ties,
I alone find it hard to harmonize with the immortal’s song.

**—Qingmen, Shao Tong**
Peaks congeal in crystalline green, brushing cloud-tips,
Six-petaled flying blossoms still damp.
Where white cranes roost, all is indistinguishable,
Yet where the azure simurgh hides, they appear the same.
The *Liang Garden* rhapsody—how could one ever match it?
The *Ying* songs’ lofty art—who dares to join?
I imagine the perfected pair returning at dawn with pendants,
Heaven’s wind mingling with the chill of jade chimes.

**—Changle, Chen Tang**
Bamboo leans on the numinous cliff, sublime,
The cold’s might, the auspicious snow’s clarity.
Cranes and simurghs circle endlessly,
Springs and stones retain their purity.
Dreams drift to distant Three Xiang,
Spirit wanders where myriad jades pour.
The hermit cherishes the *chaixiao*’s laughter,
Yet the path is too slick to tread.

**Immortal Isle’s Sacred Fungus** — *Baihu, Guo Yi*
One peak gathers auspicious mist,
A hundred plants yield to the spirit’s power.
Leaves scatter dew from golden stalks,
Fragrance congeals from the Purple Palace’s stars.
Like the Han Pond’s clamor,
Or the Shang Valley’s verdant self-sufficiency.
How could it compare to the three flowers’ splendor?
It bears the nine fields’ fragrance as well.
Floating light ascends the moonlit hall,
Piled jade-green unfolds the cloud-screen.
Would it permit a mountain dweller to pluck it,
To extend the lifespan of grasses and trees?

**—Diaotai, Li Pu**
Long ago, the true palace first stood here,
Where the auspicious herb took root.
Nine stems gleam with radiant vitality,
Three blooms weave dewdrop blossoms.
Primal *qi* nurtures perfect harmony,
The spirit-root is rarely met in this world.
Lush and splendid, it displays its felicity,
Resplendent as a jade immortal isle.
Not yielding to the Han Pond’s growth,
Nor inferior to the Shang Mountain’s greens.
How many years has its trace endured?
To this day, it spreads its fragrant (ten-word line).

**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**
The immortal peak soars above the crowd,
The sacred fungus surpasses all fragrance.
Its auspiciousness rivals the Shang Valley’s splendor,
Its purity outshines the Han land’s scent.
Cloud-leaves in spring congeal in purple,
Golden blossoms at dawn bear yellow.
Would it deign to be plucked by the dust-bound world?
From this, it scorns the fat of the rich.

**—Qingmen, Shao Tong**
Far Penglai, on the azure sea’s edge,
The world tells of this place where sacred fungus grows.
Floating light at night falls into cinnabar wells,
Scooped jade-green at dawn brims the Taiyi Pool.
The turtle’s crown bears autumn dew’s lingering fragrance,
The Shang crag’s songs end as the evening sun lingers.
How could one bear to part with such true secrets?
Better to ascend the Heavenly Altar and ask a master.

**—Changle, Chen Tang**
The land yields sacred fungus with purple leaves abundant,
Immortals pluck its blossoms to obtain deep roots.
I shamefully grow old beneath Yingzhou’s shores,
How could I ever join the Four Hoary Ones’ esteemed rank?

**Returning Tide at Green Marsh** — *Baihu, Guo Yi*
Distant islets, green riverbank trees,
The returning tide, the white sea gate.
Full of feeling, it circles Wu Isle,
Unwilling to part, seen at dawn and dusk.
Cold dips the cinnabar clouds’ reflection,
Chill shares the moon’s jade soul.
A thousand homes flow with ancient grace,
A single current from the immortal’s source.
Gazing to the limit, it coils like white silk,
Chanting done, half the (ten-word line) falls.
If the dusty tassels could be rinsed,
I would ascend the turtle’s crown to pay homage to vast favor.

**—Diaotai, Li Pu**
At Green Marsh, the tide first ebbs,
Evening rain arrives on the river.
Wave-light pure as if washed,
Ten thousand acres without a speck of dust.
Stone roots thick with reeds and rushes,
Sandbanks where wild ducks and egrets guess.
Boats moored on both banks’ narrows,
The path turns where clustered peaks open.
Dredged not by Yu’s hand,
Tributary waters return eastward on their own.
The Canglang’s fisherman sings,
Moonlit nights encircle the immortal’s terrace.

**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**
Green Marsh, a place for wandering chants,
Vast and overflowing, the early tide returns.
Boats lie where fragrant grasses bend,
Sand meets the distant great river.
Curving banks, empty pools, and Wu Isle,
A perilous rainbow hangs from the stone bridge.
From here, the immortal’s path reaches,
How many times has one sailed the layered clouds?

**—Qingmen, Shao Tong**
Distant islets, vast and hazy, the sun not yet dim,
The returning tide, a single band, seems to know its source.
In clear light, white egrets leave traces on the sand,
At dusk, green moss is washed clean, revealing stone marks.
Suddenly entering the limpid river, it still keeps faith,
Yet dividing the blue sea, all words fail.
Watching the waves, I ascend the turtle peak’s summit,
Where does the tributary flow that is Yu’s gate?

**—Changle, Chen Tang**
A traveler nears Green Marsh,
Clouds guide the receding tide far off.
Strange trees hang over the embankment,
Leisurely gulls stand on shallow sand.
Nets gather, the many fishermen done,
Sails drop, a single boat tilts.
Waiting to see the tide fill (missing character),
One should ride the Buwang’s raft.

**Travelers at South Pond** — *Baihu, Guo Yi*
Distant and winding, the South Pond’s road,
Coiling past the Taiyi Palace.
Endless mountains to behold,
Passing travelers’ thoughts know no bounds.
Homeland beyond floating clouds,
Passes and rivers in the setting sun.
Marten-fur meets Ji Zha,
Horse’s head turns toward Liang Hong.
Lodging like geese before frost,
Startled like tumbleweed on the sea.
The thoroughfare from here extends,
Who asks of weeping east or west?

**—Diaotai, Li Pu**

**Fujian’s Wealth in Mountains and Seas** — *Li Shuyi of Longxi*
Fujian abounds in mountains and seas,
Merchants vie in haste and drive.
Ceaselessly they cross for profit,
Coming and going by South Pond’s edge.
Like tumbleweed they sigh for old traces,
Like duckweed they fear new acquaintances.
At dusk they gaze toward hearth-smoke,
Cold wind stirs their temples’ threads.
Homeland lies far in the heart’s inch,
A lone cloud grieves parting’s sorrow.
In the gourd, sun and moon stretch long—
They should mock the world’s mad pursuit.

**Southern Fujian’s Post Roads** — *Li Shuyi of Longxi*
Southern Fujian’s post roads connect,
Merchants race for gain’s swift crossing.
Lean horses startle at the cold’s passage,
Light carriages drift with the shifting moon.
A traveler’s heart leaves duckweed traces,
A sojourner’s tears mourn sea and sky.
They imagine immortals’ joy,
Vainly pitying the floating world’s folly.

**Travel Thoughts at South Pond** — *Shao Yong of Qingmen*
Traveler’s thoughts linger where South Pond’s wild waters run deep,
Willows in mist, green shadows dense.
Who among homeland kin and friends remains well?
On parting roads, orioles and blossoms weary lone recitation.
Geese vanish, the heart clings to the moon over Green Marsh,
The sky empties, the gaze follows white clouds on the peak.
Halting the carriage, one should seek the true immortal’s realm—
A single inquiry of their voice outweighs ten thousand gold.

**Endless Traffic at South Pond** — *Chen Tang of Changle*
Carriages and riders throng, departing and returning,
South Pond’s road leads into green mountains.
Fragrant herbs may be gathered, fish may be hooked—
Why then toil endlessly without pause?

**Wood Ridge’s Woodcutter Songs** — *Baihu, Guo Yi*
Wood Ridge spans the mountain’s crest,
Heaven’s wind brushes the grass-clad robe.
Where clouds gather, one recites while walking,
Returning at dusk with a resonant song.
A wild temple’s bell just fades,
Households half-close their doors.
A few notes of autumn stretch vast,
A single melody under the faint moon.
Who recognizes the rotting axe-handle?
The mountain’s hush hears few listeners.
Passing on, they say, the Tortoise Peak’s summit—
An old crane offers pure insight.

**Western Ridge Veiled in Cold** — *Diaotai, Li Pu*
The western ridge shrouds in chill hues,
Wood Ridge floats in evening’s shade.
Several woodcutters return,
Their long songs strike the *shang* note.
The slow oar stirs the forest,
A thousand crags’ leaves fall deep.
Doors first seem stirred by yellow warblers,
Then startle at the clear gibbons’ cries.
The jade stream blends with secluded listening,
White clouds harmonize with the plain heart.
Ethereal, it joins immortal music,
Descending southward to the moonlit peak.

**Wood Ridge at Dawn** — *Li Shuyi of Longxi*
Wood Ridge brightens at clear dawn,
Woodcutters’ songs cross emerald groves.
Faint mountain mists darken,
Cascading ravine clouds deepen.
Startled by the stream’s gibbons’ howls,
Again surprised by the wood-spirits’ chants.
Listening below the jade pavilion,
They mingle with distant *buxu* echoes.

**Towering Wood Ridge** — *Shao Yong of Qingmen*
Lofty Wood Ridge rises above floating dust,
Woodcutters climb tirelessly.
Lost in reading, they marvel at the late mountain hues,
In resonant song, they delight in the new moon’s glow.
A few notes startle roosting pines’ cranes,
A single tune hastens returning herb-gatherers.
At dusk, Tortoise Peak’s listening nears—
One seems to hear immortal pendants descending from the celestial ford.

**Woodcutter’s Song** — *Dong Tang of Changle*
Woodcutter’s song flows slow,
Wood Ridge’s thoughts sink deep.
Escorting the sun, it follows flowing water,
Winding through clouds, it emerges from distant woods.
Nesting cranes wake from dreams,
Cave-hidden dragons startle at the chant.
A moment’s rest in the *Canglang* tune—
Hearing it, one’s lapels stir.

**Bell Mountain’s Wild Goose Pagoda** — *Baihu, Guo Yi*
A lone peak floats in purple-green,
Seven tiers vie in lush bloom.
Lofty, it nears the dragon’s heaven,
Far, it links the crow’s slanted path.
Inscribed names all belong to masters of state,
Inquiring kalpas equal river sands.
Its shadow inverts in Vimalakirti’s chamber,
Its incense divides from the Supreme One’s house.
Night lamps kindle the *qi* tree,
Morning seats fall with *udumbara* flowers.
I admire those who came before,
Their fragrant names gleam on green gauze.

**Bell Mountain Guards the True Realm** — *Diaotai, Li Pu*
Bell Mountain shields the true realm,
Standing firm by the clear river’s bank.
The pagoda leans on layered heights,
Seven tiers pierce the empty clouds.
Its lofty mark emerges from the dusty world,
Its splendid structure transcends earthly vapors.
Inscribed names link phoenix companions,
Flying pendants arrive with crane flocks.
Long have I cherished thoughts of purple mist,
Forever wishing to spread its numinous fragrance.
Unable to ascend the cinnabar ladder,
I vainly revere it at dawn’s glow.

**Bell Mountain Circles the Sacred Ground** — *Li Shuyi of Longxi*
Bell Mountain encircles the precious land,
The Wild Goose Pagoda leans on layered heights.
Lamp shadows beyond autumn clouds,
Bell tones at the edge of evening glow.
Fragrant names mark the refined scholars,
Elegant chants gather in the dragon’s heaven.
I often wish to seek its pure delight—
In what year may I renounce worldly ties?

**Famed Mountain’s Sacred Tier** — *Shao Yong of Qingmen*
The famed mountain’s precious tier parts from worldly dust,
Facing true immortals’ peaks and white clouds.
A hundred blended incense fragrances drift far with the wind,
Nine heavens’ bells and chimes divide the night’s beginning.
Flowered windows’ dharma words quiet the void,
Cassia registers’ names resound across the land.
I intend to cherish one clear gaze toward a friend—
Again I hear the cold cries of geese leaving the flock.

**The Seven-Tiered Pagoda** — *Chen Tang of Changle*
The seven-tiered pagoda gleams fresh,
Bell Mountain’s green peaks rise jagged.
Inscribed names since ancient times abound in talent—
They make those who came before awaken those who follow.
