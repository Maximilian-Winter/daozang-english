**Preface to *The Jade Casket Record***

*The Jade Casket Record* was composed by Lord Xu the Perfected of Jingyang. In former times, the Perfected One saved the people through the Dao, transmuting tiles into gold to relieve the debts of the common folk, placing talismans in water to cure their illnesses, slaying the great serpent in Shangliao, and beheading the venomous *shen* in Jiangxi. His merits and virtues were vast and boundless, beyond full recounting. Yet even after ascending to immortality with his entire household, his compassion for saving the world remained unwavering.

He observed how those who prayed and performed exorcisms often violated the prohibitions of Heaven and Earth, thereby inviting calamities and unrest. He reflected: "The Most High cherishes life as virtue, and the common people establish fasts and offer sacrifices to repent for transgressions and seek blessings. Yet, unaware of the prohibitions, they instead incur misfortune." Moved by pity, he personally examined the celestial registers, meticulously distinguishing the cyclical signs, fortunes, misfortunes, and omens of each day and hour, and disseminated this knowledge to the world. Thus, the countless multitudes with karmic affinity, whether praying or exorcising, might know how to avoid misfortune and pursue good fortune, ascending together into the realm of longevity.

The Perfected One’s intent herein reflects the heart of the Most High. Recently, the Daoist adept Ni Shouzhen of Gusou obtained this text from an extraordinary person and, receiving it with reverence and faith, feared that few would encounter it. He wished to have it printed to broaden its transmission, and thus I compose this preface.

Now, the fortunes, misfortunes, calamities, and blessings of humankind are fundamentally ordained by Heaven. Without delving into the principles of creation and transformation, one cannot thoroughly investigate and comprehend them. Only the sage can accept them, the worthy can understand them, while the rest of the multitude, unable to know or accept them, may tread upon the mechanisms of misfortune, violate the celestial prohibitions, and—though seeking to repent and atone—repeatedly err, thereby incurring even graver transgressions against Heaven’s taboos. This is why *The Jade Casket Record* was composed.

Shouzhen, having obtained it, did not keep it for himself but transmitted it to others. If people know to employ the auspicious and avoid the inauspicious, thereby evading harm in this world, his merit and conduct shall indeed be vast. For those who aspire to the Dao, if they can receive and apply this text with reverence and faith, using it to exorcise calamities, repent for transgressions, request blessings, and prolong life, their good fortune shall surely be assured.

Written on the first day of the fourth lunar month in the summer of the *guichou* year of the *Longji* reign, the eighth year of Xuande (1433), by Wu Zijin of the *Gengbi* Studio.

**Note within the Record:** The days of *wuzi* and *wuchen* are deemed usable.
**Respectfully noted.**

*The Divine Empyrean Jade Instructions* and *The Celestial Statutes of the Lady of Azure* record: On the six *wu* days, one must not burn incense—does this mean prayers and supplications for the dead are forbidden? Lord Yi must have received specific teachings on this; those who understand should exercise careful discernment.

*Master Xu’s Jade Casket Record*
The Perfected Lord observed that people of the world, when performing blessings to fulfill vows—offering memorials, presenting petitions, holding fasts, or conducting jiao rites—sometimes meet with misfortune or fortune, bringing either blessings or calamity. There are households that, despite performing blessings, suffer repeated disasters, even the ruin and dispersal of their descendants. How could this be?

The Perfected Lord examined the celestial archives and reviewed the registers. He found that the fault lay with the green-tally masters, who sought only the five fortunes and benefits, disregarding the Six Jia spirits of their ancestors in their lifetimes. They did not know that during the Six Jia cycles, the celestial luminaries might be in the underworld or among mortals, thus causing those who received blessings to suffer misfortune instead.

The Perfected Lord thereupon recorded these findings, naming them *The Jade Casket Record*, and entrusted them to the National Preceptor. The Daoist priests presented them to the throne, revealing the principles of fortune and misfortune. This method, regardless of whether the obstruction lies with heaven, earth, spirits, or ghosts, allows one to discern good and ill fortune by examining the Six Jia cycles.

**Jiazi and Yichou days:** All spirits are on earth. If one seeks blessings, conducts jiao rites to fulfill vows, prays for sons or daughters, the fortune received will be tenfold. This is because the Calculating Star (Jidu) is in the heavens to receive blessings. If one performs blessings on these days, it is an extremely auspicious omen.

**Bingyin day:** All spirits are in heaven. If one seeks blessings, fulfills vows, or performs sacrifices to mountains and rivers, or summons souls to substitute for the living, they will instead suffer misfortune. Using this day for blessings brings great inauspiciousness.

**Dingmao, Wuchen, and Jisi days:** All spirits are on earth. If one seeks blessings, presents memorials, performs sacrifices, summons souls to substitute for the living, conducts jiao rites to pray for sons or daughters, or petitions to avert calamities, the fortune received will be tenfold. Using these three days brings great auspiciousness.

**Gengwu and Xinwei days:** All spirits are in heaven, offering prayers, while the stone carriages are in the underworld. If one seeks blessings, performs sacrifices to fulfill vows, presents memorials, or petitions, the master of the household will suffer illness. Great inauspiciousness.

**Renshen day:** All spirits are in heaven, with some stationed in the underworld. If one seeks blessings, performs sacrifices, presents memorials, or prays for sons or daughters, the fortune received will be tenfold. Extremely auspicious.

**Guiyou day:** Sacrifices to the river and lake officials bring great auspiciousness. Other forms of seeking blessings are inauspicious.

**Jiaxu and Yihai days:** All spirits are in heaven, not among mortals or in the underworld. If one seeks minor blessings or makes vows at the household gate, the spirits will descend but bring misfortune instead. If the gate rites are performed during the *chen* hour, it will be auspicious.

**Bingzi, Dingchou, and Wuwu days:** All spirits are dispersed. The celestial offices pursue matters at the household gate, while the Western River’s stone carriages transport sand to the shore. If one seeks blessings, they will instead suffer unexpected disasters and even homicide. Three days of great inauspiciousness.

**Jimao and Gengchen days:** All spirits descend to the underworld. If one seeks blessings, it will benefit descendants, bringing glory, wealth, and nobility. This day is chosen by heaven for birthdays, and those born on it will enjoy great auspiciousness for forty-four days.

**Xinsi day:** All spirits are in heaven, constructing river embankments and transporting earth and stone for pagodas. They labor without rest for two or three days. If one seeks blessings, three generations will perish, descendants will fall into poverty and dispersal, and legal troubles will arise. Great inauspiciousness.

**Renwu and Guiwei days:** All spirits are in heaven. If one seeks blessings, the master of the household will die within two years, fields will yield no harvest, and disputes or legal troubles will arise. Sacrifices will cause people to drown, and wind and fire disasters will strike. Great inauspiciousness.

**Jiashen and Yiyou days:** All spirits descend from heaven to the underworld and the mortal realm. If one seeks blessings, performs sacrifices to fulfill vows, presents memorials, petitions, repays heaven and earth, or prays to avert disasters, the fortune received will be tenfold. Extremely auspicious.

**Bingxu and Dinghai days:** All spirits descend from heaven to the underworld and the mortal realm. If one seeks blessings, performs sacrifices to fulfill vows, presents memorials, or petitions, these two days are extremely auspicious.

**Wuzi and Jichou days:** All spirits are in heaven and the underworld. If one seeks blessings, performs sacrifices to fulfill vows, or repays kindness, it is greatly auspicious. But if one curses heaven and earth, it brings great inauspiciousness, and no expiation will be possible.

**Gengyin day:** All spirits are in heaven, reviewing the ledgers. If one seeks blessings, presents petitions, performs sacrifices to fulfill vows, it will cause people to drown, harm the master, and bring great inauspiciousness.

**Xinmao day:** All spirits are in the underworld. If one makes minor vows, summons souls to substitute for the living, or holds feasts for the deceased, small offerings may be used. It is moderately auspicious.

**Renchen and Guisi days:** All spirits are in heaven, dispatched to audit the registers of life and death. If one seeks blessings or performs sacrifices, it will bring illness, harm neighbors, and kill the master. Great inauspiciousness.

**Jiazi day:** All spirits descend universally among mortals. If one seeks blessings, presents memorials, petitions, or petitions to repay the Five Earth and Soil Officials, or petitions to the Perfected Lord of Life-Recording and Repentance, the fortune received on this day will be tenfold, greatly benefiting descendants. Extremely auspicious.

**Yiwei day:** All spirits are in heaven. If one performs blessings, it is slightly auspicious but not fully effective.

**Bingshen, Dingyou, and Wuxu days:** All spirits are before the Jade Emperor’s hall in heaven, compiling the registers of life and death, recording the karmic causes of good and evil, fortune and misfortune for all people in heaven and earth. If one seeks blessings or performs sacrifices, it brings great inauspiciousness.

**Jihai day:** All spirits descend from the Jade Emperor to the mortal realm and the underworld. If one performs sacrifices to seek blessings, presents memorials, petitions, or summons souls to substitute for the living, the master of the household will enjoy long life. Extremely auspicious.

**Gengzi and Xinchou days:** All spirits are in heaven. If one seeks blessings or performs sacrifices, it will bring illness, epidemics, and later homicide. Misfortune will manifest within ten years. Great inauspiciousness.

**Renyin and Guimao days:** The registers of karmic accounts are recorded. If one seeks blessings, makes vows, or offers thanks to heaven, earth, the human realm, and the six livestock, all affairs shall be greatly auspicious.

**Jiachen day:** All spirits are in the heavenly palace. Seeking blessings brings great inauspiciousness.

**Yisi day:** All spirits are in the human realm and the underworld. If one seeks blessings, performs sacrifices to fulfill vows, or petitions the River and Lake Water Officials, blessings shall be tenfold. Greatly auspicious.

**Bingwu day:** All spirits are in heaven, not in the mortal realm. Seeking blessings brings great inauspiciousness.

**Dingwei day:** All spirits are in the underworld. If one seeks blessings, fulfills vows, or presents memorials, it is greatly auspicious.

**Wushen day:** All spirits are in heaven, neither in the mortal realm nor the underworld. Those who seek blessings or fulfill vows shall harm the household’s elder, kill teachers or masters, and bring great inauspiciousness.

**Jiyou day:** Heaven grants universal amnesty. If one seeks blessings and advances fields and silkworms, it is greatly auspicious.

**Gengxu and Xinhai days:** All spirits are in heaven. Performing blessings for the River and Lake Daoist envoys or minor prayers brings half-auspiciousness. But if one presents memorials or petitions, it brings great inauspiciousness, inviting calamity and requiring exorcism.

**Renzi and Guichou days:** All spirits are in the heavenly palace. If one seeks blessings, fulfills vows, presents memorials, or petitions, it shall kill people, harm fields and silkworms. Using this day brings great inauspiciousness.

**Jiayin and Yimao days:** All spirits are in the mortal realm and the underworld. Seeking blessings, presenting memorials, petitioning to repay kindness, fulfilling vows, giving thanks, extending life, or transcending calamity brings great auspiciousness.

**Bingchen, Dingsi, Wuwu, and Jiwei days:** All spirits are in heaven. If one seeks blessings or performs sacrifices, it invites misfortune to households, harms the six livestock, and brings great inauspiciousness for four days.

**Gengshen day:** The Five Blessings open the Dao, and all spirits worshipped under heaven descend in attendance upon the Jade Emperor. This day opens the Gate of Heaven. Performing blessings, sacrifices, two-year rituals, or preparing Water and Land Masses, presenting memorials, or petitions brings great auspiciousness.

**Xinyou day:** All spirits descend from the Jade Emperor to the mortal realm and the underworld. If one seeks blessings, it brings great inauspiciousness.

**Renxu and Guihai days:** These are the days of the Six Exhausted Spirits. Praying for blessings or fulfilling vows in the mortal realm shall bring orphanhood, widowhood, and poverty. Great inauspiciousness.

The above records compile the auspicious and inauspicious days within the six *jia* cycles.

The Perfected Lord again addressed the Jade Emperor: "In the *Jade Casket Record*, if one encounters days of quarrelsome speech, days of destruction, the Four Killing Spirits, or days of obstructed death, how should this be understood?"

The Jade Emperor replied: "Regardless of such circumstances, as long as the spirits of heaven, earth, the Three Realms, and the underworld descend to the mortal realm, and the Five Blessings align, all days—without exception—are omens of great auspiciousness."

The Perfected Lord bowed again and received the teaching, which was disseminated to the world so that those who aspire to the Dao might follow its instructions.

Here ends the *Jade Casket Record* of Master Xu.
