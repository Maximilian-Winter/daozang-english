**The Supreme Cavern-Real Retrograde Mystery Stanzas**

The Supreme One unfolds the hidden mysteries,
Radiant, scattering the true scriptures.
Lofty and boundless, they bestow celestial treasures,
Revered by the ten directions.
Without beginning, without end,
Neither bright nor dim.
Ascending the Jade Capital Terrace,
Carefree, resting upon Kunlun.
Transcending the Yellow Springs’ dark city,
Even the Demon Kings long to hear.
Seven ancestors receive transformation and birth,
Dissolving my karmic grievances of past lives.
Entering, I steer the flying mystery-light;
Exiting, I ride the floating [purple] clouds.
Double brilliance illumines the Jade Dawn,
The mystery-light unfolds perfect clarity.
Far-reaching, the Cavern-Real Palace,
Resplendent, the seven treasures’ essence.
One thought transcends the eight difficulties,
Ever abiding alongside the Supreme One.
Whirling, I offer the yellow radiance,
The sun’s splendor born within the void.
The world knows only mixed and vulgar ways,
Never hearing the sutras of wisdom.
Vast are the Cavern-Real precepts,
Mysteriously moving the Demon Kings to sincerity.
Ten thousand kalpas pass like a single breath—
How could they be bound to a thousand billion aeons?
The Supreme One’s body is fundamentally nonbeing,
Dispersing form to deliver the weak and perishing.
Diligently proclaiming the mystery arts,
The Heavenly Worthy joins in praise.
For those with affinity, the scripture manifests itself;
For those without, it remains hidden as a canon.
If one can attain this Dao,
At once, primordial radiance is born.
The body crosses without awaiting a ford,
Drifting, drifting, entering the Immortals’ Hall.
Nonbeing, nonbeing—eternally without end;
Being, being—peacefully entering the wondrous.
The celestial brush flourishes in the supreme,
The mystery lineage has its own essentials.
Revolving the Three Treasures’ wheel,
The ten directions universally shine.
The Supreme One gazes upon the Jade Capital,
The Demon Kings laugh in the void.
The Heavenly Emperor clasps hands and chants,
The host of Perfected Ones rides the void in a whistling breeze.
Scattering flowers, they fulfill my vows—
The eight aspirations naturally transcend.
Divine immortals ride the auspicious clouds,
Mounting dragons, treading the mystery waves.
Harmonizing with the real, they display felicitous omens,
Lifting their feet to the eight celestial peaks.
Fortune responds without delay,
Thus releasing the heavenly nets.
The Dao crowns the three realms,
Even the earthly bonds are surpassed.
Gratitude surpasses the assembly of cloud-perfected,
The pure wisdom sutra blooms like a lotus.
The supreme awakening of the four assemblies,
Vast and boundless, beyond the great square.
The hidden and manifest surely have their causes—
Without obscurity, there is no darkness.
Swiftly turning the mystery wheel,
The perfected immortals delight in the flourishing verdure.
Wandering in the distant and indistinct,
Devas and humans see no boundary.
The numinous and wondrous, marvelously proclaimed,
Devas and humans find a ford and shore.
Sailing a boat upon the fathomless abyss,
Ever fearful of winds and waves dispersing.
Yet its affinity holds wondrous power—
Who can reckon its wisdom and might?
Gently yielding to the mystery pivot,
Luminously, the causes of darkness are judged.
The outstanding, the response-perfected disciples,
Pluck the numinous zither in the void.
Vying to revere the ten directions,
The mystery abides—no envy for me.
The Supreme One spreads the cavern scriptures,
The worthy and worthy return to their original affinity.
Desolate, the Three Treasures’ garden;
Lush and flourishing, the blossoms of my causes.
The Elder Scribe and the essence-entering,
Their substance pure, born as golden bodies.
Ending and beginning, kalpas cycle anew—
Ever more aware of the numinous countenance’s freshness.
Rarely does one pay homage to the supreme,
The precious scriptures descend to the utmost real.
The Dao’s grove flourishes in the celestial capital,
Illuminating below the earthly immortals.
Freely dispersing numinous might,
Vastly proclaiming the great Dharma.
The Supreme One surveys the ten directions,
Hazy and harmonious, merging with the phoenix’s grace.
The circular radiance reflects the three luminaries,
The Perfected Ones don the celestial robes.
The Demon Kings stand with clasped hands,
Beside the Fengdu market in the capital.
Sun and moon veil their moving brilliance,
The seven treasures gleam boundlessly.
All endeavors flourish at this time—
Disasters vanish, hells fall silent.
Floating in the boundless Heaven of No Shadows,
Even the honored cannot fathom.
The Three Treasures flourish in the ten directions,
Vast and clear in the void.
Winding, following the principles of transformation,
A single resonance lifts the Dharma wheel.
In the vast and luminous obscurity,
The four great elements arise with the times.
Emptiness and being—nothing is not possessed,
Towering and rugged, many are the mountains and peaks.
The Supreme One has no lingering thoughts,
Extinguishing thoughts, returning to the Great Vehicle.

The *Retrograde Mystery Hymns* of the ten directions begin with the north, followed by the northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, above, and below.
One hymn, one bow.
The *Retrograde Mystery* arises spontaneously, naturally,
Standing empty for over nine thousand kalpas before its scripture appeared.
The Primordial Beginning Heavenly King transmitted the Dao to the Supreme One;
After the Dao was accomplished, the Supreme One, following the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King’s command, selected it to complement the great precepts.
On one’s natal day, recite the three hundred precepts and chant this scripture.
If practicing at noon or midnight, first purify oneself, then perform the Dao.
If the natal day is unknown, use the day of *jiazi*.
After ten years, one may perform the Dao on the first day of the first lunar month.
