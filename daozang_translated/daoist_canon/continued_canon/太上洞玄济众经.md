The Supreme Dao Lord addressed the Universal Radiance Perfected One, saying:
Five kinds of smoky haze coalesce to form the body, gathering according to past karmic conditions, thereby receiving consciousness. The spirit revolves within, and thus life arises. Through consciousness, one is stained and flows into evil affinities, dwelling in benighted thoroughfares, abiding in dark realms, shrouded in filth and defilement. Demonic prisons restrain the form, enduring long kalpas of hardship, losing the luminous nature.

Thus, turning and turning again, one is lost in the bitter sea of saṃsāra, yet not a single being seeks liberation.

Universal Radiance further inquired:
From whence does the principle of smoky haze arise? Who presides over the luminous nature in the dark realm? Where do spirit and consciousness receive their forms? Are consciousness and spirit one, or are they two? If one, why two names? If two, what does each distinctly clarify? When good or evil is done, who is responsible? If it is the spirit’s doing, then the spirit is wondrous and boundless; if boundless, it would have no transgressions. Yet the two karmas must arise from somewhere—who then is the evildoer? If consciousness differs from spirit, why should punishment for one implicate the other? How may I be aided?

I have heard in the exalted teachings of the divine scriptures that the two karmas of good and evil must arise from the spirit. By this reasoning, what fault lies with consciousness? Your servant’s ignorance is profound; truly, I do not comprehend. I humbly beseech your compassion and instruction, that the karmic conditions of ten thousand kalpas may all be uplifted.

The Supreme Dao Lord addressed Universal Radiance, saying:
The five formless [elements] conjoin to produce smoky haze. Touching karma, they generate form; through form, they undergo transformation. Nature and principle harmonize, and thus they become beings. From consciousness arises change, and the spirit becomes functional. Consciousness and spirit are neither identical nor distinct. Why? Because they share the same source.

In essence, it is consciousness—five natures harmonizing. In function, it is spirit—illuminating the realm of wisdom. If the spirit lacked consciousness, where would wisdom be applied? If consciousness lacked spirit, it could not govern principle. It is like water-shield herbs blended into a fine broth: five flavors harmonize—how could they be separate? Without herbs, the taste cannot stand alone; without spirit, consciousness has no function. Thus, spirit is employed as wisdom, just as herbs are used for flavor. By this reasoning, how could there be any division?

Sentient beings cling to delusion, and thus they are benighted. Awakening is illumination; illumination has no fixed locus. Delusion is darkness—how could darkness differ in kind? Profound attachment becomes a prison, and the form is thereby confined. Without attachment or reception, there is also nothing to possess. It is like a wilderness in an uninhabited land—where could the twelve hourly spirits reside? When walls and enclosures arise, a dwelling is formed, and the spirits of the four directions manifest their numinous transformations, so that all spirits of the dwelling abide within. The dark prisons of sentient beings are likewise.

The spirit’s coming is unknown in origin; its going is unknown in destination. If evil karma is complete, the prison becomes its karmic consequence. If transgressions are exhausted, it too vanishes unnoticed.

Moreover, wisdom has great and small, spirit has noble and base. If one sees the spirit as boundless, then all people should be sages. Why is this not so? Because they are the same yet not the same.

The Radiant Perfection Realized One, you must now understand: the luminous and shadowy spirits of consciousness are fully expounded herein.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Qi flows in unbroken succession, giving rise to manifold conditions of birth. Good and evil, fortune and misfortune—each has its karmic root. It is neither heaven nor earth, nor is it other than human. It arises precisely from the mind, and the mind arises from spirit.

The body is not mine to possess. That by which I am born comes from the void and the spontaneous. Through karmic conditions, I am entrusted to the womb, transformed, and brought to life. The parents who bore me in this birth are not my original parents; my true parents are not here. Parents are noble and revered, exalted beyond all measure. The parents who gave birth to me now are but those to whom I am entrusted through karmic conditions, receiving their nurture and care. Thus, I repay them with propriety and call them parents.

Therefore, the body I receive is not truly my body. It is but a temporary dwelling, a constructed abode that shelters me. I cling to it as form, perceiving it as existence or nonexistence. Thus, those who attain the Dao no longer possess form, nor do they have a bodily spirit. When the spirits of the body unite as one, they become the true body, returning to the original parents and accomplishing the Dao.

The *Supreme Scripture of Cavernous Mystery for Deliverance of the Multitudes* concludes.
