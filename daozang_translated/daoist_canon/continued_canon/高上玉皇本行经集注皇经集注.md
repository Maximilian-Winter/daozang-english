**Volume 1: Annotated Commentaries on the *Huáng Jīng***
**Preface to the *Huáng Jīng* Annotated Commentaries**

The Dao is beyond words—all scriptures are the traces of the True Saints’ breath.
Yet since words reveal the Dao, even the sages and worthies do not discard them.
Since the Three Realms were divided, the teachings of names were established,
and though their essence is fundamentally unified, those who err may distort them.
Distortion is not the truth.

Before the myriad kalpas, the Original Beginning sat in radiant illumination.
At that time, the supreme cosmic order gathered,
and the myriad True Ones questioned the Jade Emperor about the causes of his deeds,
whereupon he expounded this scripture.
Thus, it is the most honored of all doctrinal texts,
the first of all sacred writings—no other scripture surpasses it.

Its profound words are hidden and subtle,
not indulging in extravagant ornamentation.
Though paired with the *Dàfàn* (大梵), its meaning is boundless,
and even the saints cannot fully articulate it,
nor can speculation reach its depths.
This scripture encompasses all mysteries as if they were held in the palm.

I, **Zhang Zhòng** (張仲), was devoted to ancient texts during my lifetime,
serving in the Zhou Dynasty.
My lineage revered the Celestial Emperor,
and upon hearing this scripture,
I vowed to preserve it as a lifelong treasure.

The Emperor, comparing my merits and demerits in the mortal world,
recorded me as one who walked the path of loyalty and filial piety,
and thus entrusted me to oversee the transformation of the Nine Heavens,
commanding me to compile this scripture.
Within its depths, I tasted its ineffable mysteries.

Alas, those in the world who study this scripture
fail to grasp the saints’ intent or harmonize with its Daoist essence,
erroneously publishing and transmitting it—sometimes misquoting its words and rhythms—
leading to its division into two titles: *Dòngxuán* (洞玄) and *Gāoshàng* (高上),
each clinging to private interpretations in their transmission.
This greatly contradicts the original intent of the scripture,
even to the point of rigidly adhering to falsehoods.

The reckless and deluded may either disbelieve this scripture,
or claim it borrows from other canonical works,
or ignorantly force interpretations upon it.
All such errors fail to recognize its supreme authority,
yet the consequences of karma—blessing, guilt, and retribution—
cannot be evaded.

I, Zhang Zhòng, could not bear to see this sacred text lost,
nor the vulgar ignorance of the age misapplying its teachings.
Thus, I petitioned the Emperor
to have the Daoist immortals elucidate its meaning and spread it among mortals,
making it the key to exhausting the scriptures’ depths,
and the ladder to humanity’s path.

May those who follow its sacred laws
cross the endless sea of delusion;
may its Daoist elixirs
ease the deepest of afflictions.
Hearing this scripture and awakening to the Dao,
one shall forever abandon false speculation;
encountering its teachings and recognizing the True,
one shall finally escape the cycle of rebirth.

From the Three Thousand Great Thousands,
every realm is the domain of the Great Unity;
from kalpa to kalpa,
every generation becomes a field of joy and benefit.

Seeking the Dao, one must attain it;
no wish shall remain unfulfilled.
The virtues of this scripture
are thus without reproach.

Respectfully composed.
With utmost reverence, **Zhang Zhòng**, the Imperial臣 of the **Nine-Heaven Transformative Texts** (九天開化文昌梓橦帝君), prostrates himself a hundred times.

Yānxiān says: When examining the origins of the Daoist teaching, in the primal chaos when distinctions first emerged, human affairs were yet incomplete. The Celestial Mandate (天命) bestowed upon our Daoist Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor (轩辕黄帝), to inherit the **Nine Sovereigns’** (九皇) dispensation, wield the **Six Dragons** (六龙) to govern Heaven, and establish the Celestial Pole (极) in place of Heaven, thus ordering the **Three Talents** (三才). At that time, the heavens and earth were still indistinct, lacking script, so he used knotted cords (结绳) to administer affairs; lacking dwellings, he lived in nests and caves (巢居以穴处); lacking garments, he bound grass to cover his body (结草以蔽体); lacking vessels, he drank from his cupped hands (汗尊而杯饮). Our Daoist Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor, first devised script, garments, palaces, and vessels, thereby completing human affairs. Today, among the **Nine Schools** (九流) and within the **Three Teachings** (三教), the script used, the garments worn, the dwellings inhabited, and the vessels employed are all originally instituted by the Yellow Emperor. Thus, these all stem from the Daoist teaching of the Yellow Emperor.

Moreover, the **Laozi** (老子) proclaimed: *"To give birth to Heaven, Earth, humans, and all things, there must be that which gives birth. I do not know its name; I forcefully name it the Dao, and forcefully call it Great, hence the Great Dao, and its teaching is Daoism."* Only then did the term *Dao* (道) appear in the world. Therefore, those who speak of *practicing the Dao* or *studying the Dao* are all appropriating the words of the **Laozi**, using *Dao* as their name. Are they not the disciples of the **Laozi**?

Again, when the **Laozi** spoke of *"the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious, the Gate of All Marvels"* (玄之又玄，为众妙门), the two characters *Mysterious* (玄) were also taken as names and applied to scriptures. Thus, these are all uses of the **Laozi’s** words.

Further, the *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》) text states: *"There is the Great Awakening (大觉), and only then does one know the Sage."* The term *Great Awakening* (大觉) was a name established by **Zhuangzi**; the **Emperor Huizong** (徽宗) adopted it and conferred the title *Golden Sage* (金仙) upon it. The scriptures all employ this term—these are all derived from the Daoist texts and the teachings of the Yellow Emperor, **Laozi**, and **Zhuangzi**.

**Preface to the Imperial Scripture’s Continuation and Annotation**
The character *Dao* (道) is revered equally by the **Three Teachings** (三教). Yet, reckless and deluded sects falsely label the Dao as the **Two Vehicles** (二乘), which is a profound misunderstanding. The **Jade Emperor** (玉帝) is likewise venerated by the **Three Teachings** (三教). Blind followers sometimes call him the *Lord of Heaven* (天主), claiming he is not sufficiently honored—this fails to grasp the **Jade Emperor’s** true essence and origins.

The Emperor’s virtue is boundless; his merit, unspoiled. His station is most exalted, his name most triumphant, governing all ten thousand worlds, encompassing the **Three Teachings**. He rules over the **Three Thousand Great Thousands** (三千大千), transcending kalpas with ease. The Confucianists call him the *Supreme Lord* (上帝), the Buddhists name him *Flame-Light* (燃灯), and the Daoists honor him as the *Mysterious Master* (玄主). His grandeur surpasses all others.

Beholding this scripture, one recognizes the Emperor’s wondrous deeds, dispelling doubts and perplexities of ages past and present. Alas, those who fail to understand it, who have not yet grasped its meaning, still indulge in false speculation, unable to awaken, and their sins deepen evermore. Do they not realize that human life originates from the Dao, is governed by the Emperor, and finds clarity in the Sage’s instructions?

If one scorns the Emperor, belittles Heaven, defames the scriptures, or fails to comprehend the Great Dao, it is as though one turns away from one’s roots and forgets one’s kin—unaware of the fundamental source of life and creation. Your servant, **Lǚ Wēi** (吕嵓), has long lamented this, and thus composes this preface at the head of the scripture’s annotations as a warning.

---

**Second Preface to the Imperial Scripture’s Continuation and Annotation**
The existence of Daoist scriptures is like the presence of the sun and moon in Heaven, or the statutes of a state. To behold the sun and moon yet turn one’s face to the wall is to avoid folly; to follow the laws of the ancient kings is to commit no errors. Then, to revere the true scriptures is surely the standard for entering the Dao.

Moreover, this scripture was transmitted by **Yuánshǐ** (元始), and the **Jade Emperor** and all the gods proclaimed it. It is the highest grade among the **Three Teachings**, the secret speech of the **Great Sage** (大圣), worthy of reverence in every place and kalpa.

Yet, the Dao that transcends speech is already embodied in this scripture—why need further annotations? Still, the scriptures are written in words, and only those who have already attained the Dao can truly perceive them. For those who have not yet entered the gate, these annotations are indeed a profound aid. Without a raft, how does one cross the river? Alas, to seek the Dao apart from the scriptures is wrong; to cling to the scriptures as the Dao itself is also wrong.

With the heart observing the scripture, and the scripture illuminating the heart,
when heart and spirit merge in harmony—
this celestial treasure of sacred verses
is inherently within my very nature.

**True enlightenment** thus transcends mere textual fixation—
how could there be any duality of affliction?

With reverence, **Chángchūn Fǔhuà Míngyīng Zhēn Jūn** and his disciple **Qióu Chǔjī** prostrate and pay homage.

**Preface to the *Royal Scripture*’s Collected Commentaries (First Four Sequences)**

The Dao is vast, the Jade Emperor’s majesty supreme—
the *Royal Scripture*’s sacred profundity
has long been known to me with awe.

Yet the world is often blind, giving rise to false speculation,
claiming the Dao can be abandoned,
the Celestial can be profaned,
the sacred scriptures can be slighted?
How could this be?

For the Dao exists in the scripture,
and the scripture is the very nature of this body;
the Celestial Emperor exists in Heaven,
and the Heavenly Sovereign resides within this form.

Without this embodied form, nature has no foundation,
and its marvels remain obscured;
without the Heavenly Sovereign, the body lacks a master,
and the form becomes mere emptiness.

Since body and heart cannot be abandoned,
how could the Emperor’s grace go unrepaid,
the scripture’s merit go unacknowledged?

Yet faith in the scripture is not mere textual adherence—
it is the divine realization of the heart.
If truly attained and never forgotten,
then the wondrous fruit will surely manifest.

With reverence, **Léitíng Dàyuán Shuài** and his disciple **Dèng Tiān Jūn** prostrate and pay homage in solemn devotion.

**Three Praises**
**Dèng Tiān Jūn** kneels and declares:

**Praise**
Great is the Supreme Dao, without sectarian bounds—
the True One above all.
The Dao
Soars beyond the Three Teachings,
and this alone is most honored.

**Praise**
Majestic is the Jade Emperor,
unmatched among the Three Teachings.
The Emperor
Over vast sands and calamitous ages,
eternally returns to the Supreme Sovereign.

**Praise**
The Imperial Scripture, a grand canon,
subtle and profound.
The Scripture
Embraces all Three Teachings,
its dharma-rules most exalted.

**Preface to the *Royal Scripture with Annotations: Initial Compilation***

The Sage-King did not speak of gods,
yet revered the Supreme Sovereign;
The Confucian scholar avoided esoteric talk,
yet upheld the study of the heart.

The Supreme Sovereign was indeed what the Confucian
dared not slight—
yet none observed the Dao-scriptures,
grasped the profound intent,
or fused the Three into One.

Was it because they established separate schools?
Or because they lacked time to practice the Way?
Alas, how narrow-minded!

The matter lies not in conforming to names,
but in the true benefit of the Dao.
If the Mystic Scripture is wrong,
how can it speak of the Way?
If it is correct,
why then does it differ from Confucianism,
and why cling so rigidly?

Your servant, Hong Xian, in youth studied Confucian texts,
and once encountered the Mystic Canon—
as if gaining some insight, yet dared not claim it.
Later, ascending to the Dragon’s Peak,
dwelling on the Golden Phoenix Slope,
I had the chance to peruse the Three Teachings’ writings,
and came to know that none surpasses the Dao,
none is deeper than the Mystic.

Among the Three Teachings, none surpasses the *Royal Scripture*,
like beans, grains, cloth, and silk—indispensable.
Its profound meanings are hard to fathom;
the annotations of the immortals must be transmitted.
Thus, I withdrew to the secular world,
devoutly compiling this volume.
Alas, my frail body weakens daily,
and I have not yet seen it published.

Later, I met a recluse from Shandong’s Jinan,
Master Zhou Yunqing,
who lectured on the Mystic Scripture
and compiled the *Dao Canon*,
so I entrusted my words to my friend Tian Zhuozi
to record and pass them on.

Winter of the Ming Dynasty’s Wanli thirteenth year,
former Chief Examiner Fang Yiji of Jiangxi
knocked at my door to request this preface.

**Preface to the *Royal Scripture with Annotations***

The difficulty of speaking of the Dao has long endured.

---

I, **Xuan Zheng**, am but a coarse and lowly scholar of the secular world—how dare I speak of the Dao, or compile the *Mystic Canon* and annotate the *Royal Scripture*?

To carry a mountain on a mosquito’s back is folly; it only reveals my inadequacy.

Yet the Great Dao does not abandon the humble and unrefined, and even the lowly can grasp its teachings.

Though the *Jewel Scripture* is profound, the annotations of the immortals are clear and evident.
When **Master Luo Taishi** entrusted me with this work, not including it in the *Dao Canon* would be to conceal Heaven’s treasure;
including it without proper understanding would be equally perilous.

I fear that my limited insights may misrepresent the Dao’s essence,
fail to harmonize the immortal’s intent with my own,
and force-feed interpretations that leave readers unsettled—
spoiling the Dao’s pure flavor, and thus my own guilt would be all the greater.

Alas, those who expound the Dao are few in this age,
and I, a humble and unlearned man, presume to record my thoughts.
It is fitting that I incur blame without merit.

But my resolve is to uphold the Dao,
and if the esteemed **Dao-adept** **Yingliu** examines my words with compassion,
then continues to elucidate their meaning to propagate this Scripture’s truth,
my labor will not be in vain.

Respectfully written,
**Ming Wanli fifteenth year (1587),** the Dao-adept **Zhou Xuan Zheng of Shandong** pays homage in a hundred bows.

**Preface to the *Royal Scripture with Annotations*—Copy for Circulation**

To uphold the Dao and illuminate one’s name,
thus honoring one’s ancestors—
this is the age-old principle of **loyalty as the fulfillment of filial piety**.

I, **Wang Jingcu**, was raised in Confucian scholarship,
though I knew of Heavenly Emperor’s grandeur,
I truly understood that the Dao’s practice lies beyond worldly gain.

After studying the *Dao Canon* under **Master Zhou Yunqing**,
and diligently transcribing texts,
I observed the *Royal Scripture’s Annotations* and realized:
the Three Teachings share a single principle,
and **Nature** and **Dao** are inseparable.

This Scripture points directly to the Mystic Essence—
understanding it reveals the Dao in its entirety.

Thus, I presumptuously wrote this preface to inspire myself,
**Ming Wanli sixteenth year (1588), summer, in the capital**,
the Dao-adept **Wang Jingcu** pays homage.

**Examination of the Dao’s Origins**

**Examination of the Dao’s Origins**

The Dao is originally formless and nameless—who could probe its source, whence could it be examined? From the Primordial Beginning, the Great Void bore the Mystic Existence, and the Dao’s hidden splendor emerged, its name thereby established. The One True Principle encompasses the Three, and the Three Teachings stand forth. Being and non-being, beginning and end, are not beyond the Five Phases. Eon follows eon in generation, sage follows sage in transmission—all are the Dao. Even if one transcends the Three Realms and lies beyond the Five Phases, one cannot escape being a practitioner of the Dao. Thus, the Dao’s manifestation and the name of the Daoist school originate here. Therefore, we first trace the source of the Scripture.

**Source of the Scripture**
Scriptures bear the Dao, guiding the world with compassionate passage. All scriptures are the sacred utterances of enlightened sages, containing nothing but supreme truth. Yet this Scripture originates from the Primordial Beginning, its transformation rooted in the Jade Emperor. The Primordial Beginning is the first of the Three Teachings, the Jade Emperor the sovereign of all laws. This Scripture reaches the utmost profundity and subtlety, surpassing the Three Teachings; it is also the king of all scriptures, enduring through endless calamities. Its transmission begins from the beginningless, concealed in the Mystic Heaven, hidden within the Jade Peak. Its characters are not of ordinary kind—each spans a yard in breadth, their light piercing infinitely. The Celestial True Person, in response to the times, inscribed and passed it down to the world. Thus, the Scripture’s proclamation was made.

Therefore, we continue tracing the Dao’s source.

**The Jade Emperor: Supreme Sage, Original Master, and Lineage**
The Master, to guide the world, dispels delusion and extracts beings from suffering, transmitting the Dao and bestowing scriptures, opening the path for future generations. The Great Dao Master unifies the Three Teachings, encompasses all laws, dwelling in the Heaven of Heavens, as the Sage among sages—beginningless and endless, its origin unfathomable, prior to all phenomena. Yet the Dao’s subtlety divides into the True: it manifests in the radiant, pure, and blissful realm of the past eon.

Mortals observe the Yang Dao of Heaven’s brilliance—Yang governs bestowal, its mechanism ever active. The Emperor is thus revered as the **Zhang Emperor**. Misguided followers fail to grasp this truth, falsely claiming that the present **Zhang clan of Xingtai, Hebei (formerly True Definition Prefecture, Row Tang County)**, descends from the Jade Emperor. How could they confuse the **Zhang clan of Row Tang**, descendants of **Zhang Guo** and heirs of the **Zhang Immortal**, with such a claim?

This is merely an examination of lineage and clan.

If one speaks of lineage, the Jade Emperor is the primordial emanation of the Great Dao, the ancient ancestor of the cosmic cataclysm—how could he be bound by birth, death, or name? The Emperor’s sacred consort, sacred children, and attendants are all manifestations of the Light-Strong Prince’s celestial retinue in past eons. When the Emperor ascends, his retinue attains the Way entirely. In truth, the Emperor and his retinue are not of mortal female form—they are the purest essence of Heaven. To guide all beings, they manifest in female form, as the scriptures have already stated. Even the Buddha attained enlightenment with his wife and children achieving sainthood.

To call the Jade Emperor the **Dao Ancestor**, across countless eons, all beings and classes are the generative intent of Heaven and Earth, branches of the Dao’s vital pulse. Who among them is not part of the Jade Emperor’s retinue and lineage? When the retinue of the Great Luo Palace attains the Way, they become celestial and saintly bodies. As with Manjusri presiding over the Immaculate World, or the Dragon Princess attaining the Way and transforming into male form—this is the same principle.

Yet today’s monks, Daoists, and common folk fail to grasp this truth, falsely believing the Jade Emperor has a retinue, undergoes rebirth, and is bound to the Two Vehicle fruits. How could they know that the celestial realms are countless, while the Three Pure Ones’ realm and the Great Luo Heaven are boundless? The celestial emperors undergo rebirth, but the Jade Emperor does not. For the Jade Emperor is the Dao Body—Dao is endless, how could the Jade Emperor be finite?

Truly, the Jade Emperor is the supreme teacher of all Buddhas of the One Vehicle, the sovereign of all heavens, and his retinue is the marvel of Dao transformation. Such is the essence of the mystical lineage.

Scholars must not speak recklessly—examine this carefully.

**On the Merit of Engraving Scriptures:**
In ancient times, there were no paper or brushes; records were inscribed on bamboo and wood. When **Mong Tian** and **Cai Lun** invented paper and ink, the merit of preserving scriptures doubled. Later, high sages carved wooden blocks for printing, multiplying the merit yet again.

Yet ignorant followers of false sects do not know that Mong Tian and Cai Lun received blessings from the **Tusita Heaven**, and that these two were later punished in the underworld for their sins. Their journey through the netherworld was guided by the **Great Sage of the Great Elixir Heaven** and **Kshitigarbha Bodhisattva**, who entered the underworld with scriptures to transform and liberate those guilty of heresy. How could these two suffer in hell? Their merit was vast—they were of the highest rank in engraving and propagating the teachings.

**On the Merit of Reciting, Chanting, and Teaching Scriptures:**
Recitation and exposition must be done with utmost sincerity, free from attachment, greed, or delusion. The merit will then match the scriptures’ words. Printing and distributing scriptures bring even greater merit, as they spread the Dharma widely. To treat scriptures lightly, defame them, or damage them is a grave offense. Be warned—do not betray the teachings of the sages.

**On the Similarities and Differences of the Jade Emperor’s Sacred Titles:**
The Jade Emperor’s sacred titles date from before the cosmic cataclysm, were further honored in the Middle Ages, and are now praised anew. Rulers who cherish the Dao, moved by the **Mysterious Grace**, honor them according to their own revelations and devotions. As circumstances align and deeds are accomplished, their fame spreads, and all revere the divine titles, establishing their names.

The Jade Emperor has four forms:
1. The **Taiwei Jade Emperor**, named after the star **Taiwei** in the **Taiwei Enclosure** during the Han dynasty under Emperor Wu;
2. The **Brahman Heaven Jade Emperor**, named after the **Celestial Market Enclosure** during Emperor Xuan’s reign;
3. The **Flame Flower Shao Wei Jade Emperor**, named after the **Primordial Fixed Position** during Emperor Ai’s reign;
4. The **Zixu Jade Emperor**, named after the **Post-Heaven Stem** during Emperor Guangwu’s reign.

None of these are the true Jade Emperor. The true Jade Emperor bears the title:
**Emperor of the Golden Gate of the Highest Sovereign of the Natural and Mysterious Perfection, the Primal and Perfect, the Jade Sovereign Emperor, also called the Highest Supreme Jade Emperor of the Mysterious Vault.**

This Emperor governs all heavens, never decaying or perishing. The world does not fully understand, mistakenly equating him with **Shakra (Indra)**. Yet the Jade Emperor’s titles are distinct. The four Jade Emperors all fall under the governance of the **Highest Supreme Jade Emperor**. Those who speak of the Four Emperors and the Heavenly Sovereign as equals are also mistaken. Those who understand the heavens will clarify this.

**On the Jade Emperor’s Sovereignty Over the Extremes:**
**Ge Xianhui** said: The heavens of the world, as perceived, are the same. Confucianism speaks of **One Heaven and Earth, One Emperor**. Daoism speaks of **thirty billion worlds**, each with thirty-six heavens, each heaven ruled by an emperor, all under the governance of the **Highest Supreme Jade Emperor**. Buddhism speaks of **three thousand great thousand-world systems**, each with thirty-two heavens, each ruled by a Jade Emperor.

Though the three teachings seem divergent, those who speak of **One Heaven** refer to the **Great Void** beyond, calling it unfathomable, and speak of **thirty billion worlds**—beyond which lies the **Inconceivable**. Those who speak of **three thousand great thousand-world systems** say that beyond them lies the **Limitless**. Thus, Confucianism follows the **Imperial Norm**, saying, *"The sage approximates Heaven."* Heaven’s body is boundless, and this principle holds true at the **Great Convergence of the Cosmic Cycle**.

Daoism speaks of the **Highest Supreme Void**, the True Emperor who never decays; Buddhism speaks of **Suchness**, self-liberated and never regressing. Both affirm that the Jade Emperor never perishes. Thus, speaking of **One Heaven** is not an omission—it is a general name encompassing all, harmonizing with Dao and Buddhism. Speaking of **thirty billion worlds** or **three thousand great thousand-world systems** is not false—it is a division by number, aligning with Confucianism.

As for Buddhism’s claim that each world has its own Jade Emperor, each realm has its own **Ultimate**, Daoism asserts that all worlds share **this Jade Emperor**, all realms share **the One Beyond Extremes**. The **Great Void**, the **Inconceivable**, the **Limitless**—all speak of the unchanging Dao, the Jade Emperor ever-present. If one divides worlds and claims the Jade Emperor differs, how could the **Beyond Extremes** have duality? If one says the Emperor changes with cosmic cycles, how could the **Beyond Extremes** decay?

Since the Dao does not decay, the Jade Emperor is eternal. Truly, do not cling to demonic doctrines to defame the sages.

**On the Jade Emperor’s Realm of Qingwei Heaven:**
**Wang Chongyang** said: **Qingwei** is the highest and most mysterious realm of Heaven, the Daoist **Seed-Citizen Heaven**, the Confucian **Boundless Beyond**, the **Enduring Azure**—and in Buddhism, the **Non-Regressing Realm**.

「Now within the chaotic scriptures of Chan Buddhism, there is a mistaken claim that the Jade Emperor resides atop **Mount Sumeru (Must Prāṇidhāna)**, which is actually the realm of the **Four Heavenly Kings of the Day and Moon (Sūryaprabhāraja, Candraprabhāraja, and the four Dikpāla)**—a place where destruction may occur, save for the **Inner Court of Maitreya (Maitreya’s Inner Sanctuary)** as the **Non-Regressing Realm**.

They also speak of **Mileo Enclosure (Mīlùo Yuán)**, **Mileo Garden (Mīlùo Yuán)**, or **Mileo’s Pure True Realm (Mīlùo Xuánzhēn Jìng)**—these three names refer to the **Supreme Primordial Lord (Wúshàng Yuánjūn)** of Daoist scriptures, who manifests as the Jade Emperor in the **Non-Regressing Realm of Mileo’s Pure True Realm (Mīlùo Xuánzhēn Jìng)**. The **Four Heavenly Kings of the Day and Moon**, however, are the abode of the **Lesser Heavenly Emperor (Tàiwēi Yùdì)**, not the **Great Heavenly Emperor (Dàtiānzūn)**, the exalted Jade Emperor. Hence, Daoist scriptures say:

*"At the peak of **Mount Xuangu (Xuángǔ Shān)**, there is an **Imperial Sovereign (Dìjūn)**. One must pay homage to the **Jade Sovereign, Great Heavenly Emperor (Yùhuáng Dàtiānzūn)**."*

**Mount Xuangu (Xuángǔ Shān)** is the Chan Buddhist **Mount Sumeru (Must Prāṇidhāna)**, the master of the **Day and Moon Heavenly Realm (Rìyuè Tiān)**, and the deity governing this realm—akin to the **Prefect of the Imperial Capital (Jīngzào Yìn)** of ancient times. Thus, when the **Buddha (Rúshì)** preaches the **Dharma (Fǎ)**, and the Emperor of the **Heavenly Realm (Tiānshì)** spreads his canopy—this is the **state examination (Zhuàngyuán Jìdì)** where a scholar attains highest honors. The **Golden Hall (Jīndiàn)** transmits the successful candidates, the **Ministry of Rites (Lǐbù)** raises the cups, and the **Prefect of the Imperial Capital (Jīngzào Yìn)** spreads the canopy to honor the **court’s recognition of virtue (cháotiān zhēngxián zhī yì)**. The heretical sects thus falsely equate the **canopy-spreading Emperor of the Heavenly Realm (Zhānggài Jīngzào Yìn)** with the **Great Heavenly Emperor (Dàtiānzūn)**, declaring the **Prefect of the Imperial Capital (Zhānggài Jīngzào Yìn)** as the **Emperor (Huángdì)**. How erroneous this is! Such falsehoods are most perverse.

As for the claim that **Mount Kunlun (Kūnlún Shān)** has eight abodes: the **Eight Directions** may indeed encompass eight extremes, but all eight extremes converge in the **western-northern direction (xīběi)**, where **Mount Kunlun (Kūnlún Shān)** stands as the **Pillar of Heaven and Cornerstone of Earth (Tiānzhù Dìwéi)**—the Daoist **Mount Xuangu (Xuángǔ Shān)** and the Buddhist **Mount Sumeru (Must Prāṇidhāna)**. How could there be eight of them? The common folk have long been misled by such falsehoods, so now, in examining the **Non-Regressing Realm of Qingwei Heaven (Qīngwēi Tiān)**, I clarify and warn against mistaken theories.

**On the Jade Emperor’s Rank and Status (Yùdì Zūncì Kǎo):**
**Liu Haichan (Liú Hǎichán)** said: The Jade Emperor, in Daoism, is the **manifestation of the Three Pure Ones (Sānqīng)**. Daoists first speak of the **Three Pure Ones (Sānqīng)**, then the **Void (Xūwú)** and the **Mysterious Existence (Miàohǔ)**, which are the **Non-Extreme (Wújí)** and **Great Ultimate (Tàijí)**—not implying any hierarchy of superiority or inferiority. In Buddhism, he is the **Ancient Lamp Buddha (Rán Dēng Gǔfó)**, who reveals himself in the **body of Śākyamuni Buddha (Shìjiā Fóshēn)**. Chan Buddhists, however, place the Jade Emperor before the Buddha, following the foreign custom of honoring their **ruler (Zhǔ)** before the **Chinese Emperor (Huángdì)**.

If we examine the Daoist reverence, the *Golden Wheel Sutra (Jīn Lún Jīng)* states:
*"The Jade Emperor mounts the **Mysterious Command Chariot (Yùdòu Xuánmìng Jià)**, his spirit traverses the **Supreme Extremity (Shàngjí)**, with the **Five Stars (Wǔxīng)** as his messengers before him, and the **Buddhas and Devas (Shìfàn)** as his **威仪 (auspicious retinue)** behind him."*

The **Buddhas and Devas (Shìfàn)** are **immortals, Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas (Xiānfó Púsà)**. The Jade Emperor’s trust in the **Three Pure Ones (Sānqīng)** and the **Buddhas (Fó)** demonstrates his **body (shēn)** and **degree (dù)** to guide all sentient beings, leading them to **return to the Dao (guīdào)**. The common folk, however, arbitrarily divide the **ranks of the divine (shèngwèi)**, failing to investigate the **source and flow (yuánliú)**, and consider the Jade Emperor as a **secondary deity (cìzūn)**—thus implying there are beings greater than the Emperor. Even more absurd, they compare the **Three Pure Ones (Sānqīng)** and the **Buddhas (Fó)** to the **Supreme Emperor (Tàishàng Huáng)**, contradicting the **progressive manifestation (xiān-hòu xiǎnhuà)** of the Jade Emperor. Further, they falsely equate the **divine with different surnames and titles (yìxìng yìhào)** to father and son, their offense being even more grave.

Alas! The world cannot do without the Jade Emperor, just as a life must have its **ancestral lineage (zōngzǔ)** and **parents (fùmǔ)**. To defame the Emperor and establish separate sects is to **abandon one’s ancestral lineage and parents while elevating oneself (shě zōngzǔ fùmǔ ér zì zūn)**. How can this be justified?

**On the Jade Emperor’s Auspicious Title (Yùdì Hào Chēng Lìyì Kǎo):**
**Lan Caihe (Lán Cǎihé)** said: People know to honor the **Emperor of Heaven (Tiānshì)**, yet they do not recognize the **Jade Emperor’s sacred title (Yùdì Bǎohào)**. Confucians may say reciting it is improper, but do they not know that **great filial piety is to revere one’s parents throughout life (Mò fùmǔ ér xīnchéng)**—is this not the teaching of **Mencius (Mèngzǐ)**?

To **revere one’s parents with sincerity (mò fùmǔ ér xīnchéng)** makes one a **filial son (xiào zǐ)**. To **invoke the Jade Emperor’s title with sincerity (chēng Dìhào ér xīnchéng)** ensures one will never commit transgressions, making them a **true child of Heaven and Earth (Qiánkūn xiāozǐ)**. To **embody the form and emulate the Dao (jiànxíng wéi xiāo)** is to **submit to Heaven and Earth (tiān dì jiēguī)**, and what greater benefit could there be?

**On the Auspicious Benefits of the *Imperial Scripture (Huáng Jīng)* (Huáng Jīng Lìyì Kǎo):**
**Zhang Ziyang (Zhāng Zǐyáng)** said: With the rise of **imperial rulers (Dìwáng)**, there must be **imperial institutions (Dìwáng zhì)**. Those who transgress these institutions are rare indeed. Yet, the **Heart Seal of the *Imperial Scripture (Huáng Jīng Xīnyìn)**** is the **essence of Daoist practice (Dàodào Zhīyào)**, embodying it makes one the **Supreme Sage (Zhìshèng)**, far beyond merely avoiding transgressions. If people today do not believe in its benefits, it is because they have not **sincerely practiced its recitation and essence (tǐhuì shìchí wèichéng)**. The wise should ponder this.

**On the *Imperial Scripture’s* Record of Merit and Demerit (Dì Jīng Jiàolù Gōngguò Kǎo):**
**Zhong Lizi (Zhōng Lìzǐ)** said: The **birth of all beings (Rénwù zhī shēng)** originates from the Dao, all receiving **true essence (Zhēn)** from the **Heavenly Emperor (Tiāndì)**. Thus, if one is **virtuous (shàn)**, their **virtue moves Heaven (Dé dòng Tiān)**, and blessings naturally arrive, even if they are poor and lowly, their **tranquility and joy surpass others (ānlè shèng yú tārén)**, making them the **True Hall of Blessings (Zhēn Fú Táng)**. If one is **wicked (è)**, they **create their own calamity (zì zuò niè)**, and Heaven sends **disasters (Tiān xiàng yāng)**—even if they are rich and noble, their **misfortune and retribution (xiōng jiù)** make them an **active hell (Huódì Yù)**.

**Destiny of blessings and calamities (Huòfú)** is fixed, following the **virtue or wickedness of mortals (rén shàn è)**; the **interaction between humans and Heaven (Tiān rén jiāoyìng)** is swift as **echoes and responses (yǐngxiǎng)**. The deluded do not believe this, so they speak of **merit (Gōnggé)** as follows: **"Sincerely reciting the *Imperial Scripture (Huáng Jīng)*** in its entirety earns **a thousand kinds of merit (qiān zhǒng gōngdé)**, leading one to ascend to **Heaven’s Hall (Shèng Tiān Táng)**."**

**"Sincerely reciting (Zhēn shìchí)"** means **unifying inner and outer (nèiwài zǒngyī)**, **words and deeds aligning with the Dao (yánxíng hé dào)**, not merely **uttering scriptures with one’s mouth (wéi kǒu shàng niàn jīng)** but **practicing true goodness in one’s heart (wéi xīnxīn shíshàn)**. Truly well said!

**Wang Lingguan (Wáng Língguān)** said: *"Why should the skilled hand draw my likeness? Only wish your heart align with mine."* If one’s heart can **align with the Heavenly Emperor’s (Xīnxīn hé Tiāndì)**, then **virtue and blessings flourish together (Dé fú bìng miào)**, achieving **true recitation and meritorious deeds (Zhēn shìchí shàn gōng)**. As for the rest who merely **recite scriptures and restrain their mouths while disciplining their hearts (Jǐ kǒu zhì xīn)**, though they may have **faith and merit (fúdé)**, their blessings depend on the **size of their virtue (shàn zhī dàxiǎo)**—this is yet another inferior level.

**On the Demerits (Guògé):**
They say: *"If one does not believe in this scripture, they fall into **heterodox paths (xiédào)***, for their **heart does not align with the Dao (xīn bù hé dào)**, thus becoming a **wicked person (yé rén)**."* They also say: *"To **defame true scriptures (huǐ chán zhēn wén)** is to **fall into hell (shēn duò Dìyù)**."* Those who do not believe merely **hear of the scripture’s merits (jīngzhōng gōngdé)**, yet fail to **truly embrace them (xīn shì bù jí)**, are guilty of lesser transgressions. But to **defame the scriptures is to erase Heaven’s decrees (fèi Tiān zhāng)***—their **heart commits great evil (xīn zuò dàxiè)**, their **misfortune and retribution (xiōng jiù)** are boundless, sinking them into **dark and malevolent realms (yīn è zhī dì)**, their crimes unforgivable, thus they fall into **the path of hell (Duò Dìyù Lù)**.*

They further say: *"To **slander the Emperor and defame the Sages (Dìshì huǐshèng)**, **abolish the divine abode (fèi shén zhù)**, **tear apart true scriptures (liè zhēn jīng)**, and **persist in wickedness without remorse (wán è wú quān)**, will forever suffer **karmic restraints (yè jìn)**, and their **calamity extends to seven generations (huò jí qī zǔ)**."* To **defame and tear apart scriptures (huǐliè jīngwén)** is to **blaspheme the sacred texts (kǒu shàn língzhāng)**, their **words dare Heaven’s authority (yán mà Tiān wēi)**, so their **crime rests upon themselves (zuì zài zìjǐ)**. To **slander the Emperor and tear apart scriptures (Dìshì liè jīng)**, to **indulge in evil without repentance (zòng è bù quān)**, makes one’s **body unvirtuous (shēn wéi bùshàn)**, leaving **endless infamy (yí chǒu wúqióng)**, harming one’s **substance (tǐ)** and **dishonoring one’s kin (rú jīn)**. Even if one were a **filial son or a kind grandson (xiào zǐ cí sūn)**, they could not **redeem this across a hundred generations (bǎi shì bù néng gǎi)**."*

「The **karmic faults (guì yè)** of one’s own person—when will they ever cease? The **calamity upon one’s ancestors (zǔ qīn zhī jiù)**—how could they ever be pardoned? If not, then the state establishes laws, and punishing criminals is acceptable. Yet why are there those who **exterminate the three lineages (yí sān zú)** or **destroy the nine lineages (miè jiǔ zú)**? It is because the **crime exceeds the measure (zuì fàn guò zhòng)**, thus extending to one’s relatives. But if this is so, then though the **legal net (fǎ wǎng)** may stretch far, others may still **hold erroneous views of scriptures (yǐ chǒu jīngdiǎn)**, or **recite them without reverence (sòng zhì bù qián)**, or **misinterpret and belittle them (chí niàn éu màn)**, or **arbitrarily alter their teachings (màng yì cái dù)**, or **condemn one while praising another (shì cǐ fěi bǐ)**, or **prefer the latter while disparaging the former (yōu bǐ liè cǐ)**. According to their **transgressions’ severity (guò zhī dà xiǎo)**, there is a **fixed retribution (yīdìng zhī bào)** awaiting them.

*Alas!* The **Imperial Sutra (Dìshì jīng)** is the **law of the present age (jīn fǎ)**. To **disbelieve the sovereign’s law (bù xìn Wáng fǎ)**, the **statutes have clear decrees (lǜ yǒu míng zhāng)**; to **not follow the sacred precedents (bù zūn shèngdiǎn)**, how could **Heaven’s ordinances (Tiān tiáo)** not exist? Lamenting that **the human body is hard to obtain (rén shēn nán dé)**, and the **supreme Dao is difficult to hear (shàng dào nán wén)**, parents labor to give birth to us—**their toil and suffering are the same (láo kǔ tóng)**. Those with **virtue (dé)** bring **blessings to their ancestors (fú zǔ qīn)**, ascending in this very life to the **highest ranks (dēng jiǎ kē)**, and receiving **honors that exalt their kin (fēng zèng xiǎn qīn)**. Those with **faults (guò)** bring **calamity to their ancestors (huò zǔ qīn)**, just as today’s **offspring and descendants (zǐ dì fàn shì)** may be punished for crimes, **and the penalty falls upon the family elders (zuì zuò jiā zhǎng)**. Though **human bodies are equal (rén shēn tóng)**, **good and evil differ (shàn è yì)**; though **parental kindness is the same (qīn ēn tóng)**, **blessings and karmic consequences vary (fú yè shū)**. Why then does a person **not choose goodness but delight in evil (wú shàn zuò è)**, **merely burdening their ancestral lineage (tú yí lèi zǔ zōng)**?

The **Imperial Sutra’s (Huáng jīng)** teachings on **merit and demerit (gōng guò gé yán)** demonstrate its **truth within the human heart (zhēn jīng zài rén xīn shàng)**. **Pure goodness (chún shàn)** naturally fulfills the **sutra’s merit (jīng gōng)**. The **highest sages (shàng zhì)** act in **harmony with the sutra’s essence (zì hé jīng)**, not relying on mere **verbal recitation (kǒu sòng)**. The **middle sages (zhōng zhì)** **discern the Dao through the sutra (yīn jīng jiàn dào)**, while the **lowly and ignorant (xià yú)** **do not believe even when told (yǔ yán wú xìn)**. Since **highest sages are rare (shàng zhì bù cháng yǒu)**, and **lowly and ignorant few (xià yú yì bù duō)**, the **common folk (zhōng rén)** are vast—**thus the efficacy of teaching and cultivation (jiào huà zhī gōng)** cannot be neglected.

Those who **contemplate this sutra (guān zhì jīng)**—how could they **fail to embody the Jade Emperor’s (Yù Dìshì)** **compassionate guidance of the world (cí bēi dù shì zhī yì)**, and instead **regard it as ordinary (shì wéi fàn cháng)**?

Regarding the **annotations and interpretations of the Imperial Sutra (Huáng jīng jí zhù yì lüè kǎo)**:
Zhōu Xiànlín states:
*The **Imperial Sutra (Huáng jīng)** speaks of the **true nature of the Dao (dào zhī zhēn)**—what is inherently **divided by one’s innate nature (wú xìng fēn gù yǒu)**. It should **not require elucidation (yí bù xū jiě)**. Most people are **overly concerned (duō lǜ)**, with **varying capacities (zī yǒu gāo xià)**. Those with **partial insights (piān jiàn zhě)** are many, and the **immortals (zhū xiān)** interpret it thus—**not all can fully expound the profound meaning (fēi néng jìn shuō xuán zhǐ)**. This is merely **prepared for later generations’ reconciliation (gū bèi hòu rén zhī zhé zhōng ěr)**.*

Regarding the **differences in the Imperial Sutra (Huáng jīng tóng yì kǎo)**:
Zhāng Zǐfáng states:
*This sutra originally had **no dual names (bēn wú èr míng)** or **distinction between Highest Sage and Supreme Spirit Jewel (gāo shàng líng bǎo zhī fēn)**. Later scholars **erroneously annotated (cūn rén chuān jiàn)**, **arbitrarily adding or subtracting words (suí yì zēng jiǎn zì jù)**, **forcibly linking texts (qiān hé wén)**, and **utterly lost the original intent (shū shī běn zhǐ)**. Now, upon **examining the Highest Sage and Supreme Spirit Jewel (gāo shàng líng bǎo)****,** they stem from **various immortals’ praise (gè xiān zhēn chēng yáng yǔ)**. Later generations mistakenly **took them as two separate texts (wù zhí wéi èr)**. Here, we **adhere to the Mystic Capital’s (Xuándū)** **definitive analysis (dìng lùn)** and **record the transmitted versions (lù chuán shì jiān)**. Later students **should examine this carefully (jiàn zhì mò tǐ)** and, upon encountering **errors in transcription, transmission, or exposition (yù yú kān xiě chuán jiǎo chā chù)**, **cross-reference with authoritative editions (cóng gōng kǎo jiào)**. Any **external additions of words, phrases, or illustrations (wài tiān wén jù zì huà)** are all **erroneous (é wù)**. **Enlightened ones should not rigidly cling to these (dá zhě wù ní zhí yán)**.*

Regarding the **annotations, interpretations, and transmitted commentaries of the Imperial Sutra (Huáng jīng jí zhù kān chuán shū wén)**:
**Your humble servant, Zhōu Xuándéng**, a **successor of the Complete Perfection (quán zhēn)** **disciple of the Small Dao Master (xiǎo zhào shēn)**, **sincerely fearful and reverent (chéng huáng chéng huáng)**, **prostrates himself with head bowed (qǐ shǒu dùn shǒu)**, **fasting and purifying himself with a hundred bows (zhāi mù bǎi bái)**, **petitions:**

*Truly, the Dao’s **mystery and effortless nature (miào wú wéi)** **manifests itself through time and circumstances (měi yīn shí ér zhuó jiàn)**; **human hearts have awareness (rén xīn yǒu jué)****,** and thus **should accumulate merit according to the place (yí suí dì yǐ jī gōng)**. Your humble servant, **Xuándéng**, though **of lowly disposition (wéi zhì)** and **the least of the Three Talents (sān cái mò pǐn)**, **aspires to the wondrous law and returns to the Mystic (mù miào fǎ yǐ guī xuán)**. Originally **a Confucian scholar (běn rú háng)**, he **later encountered the Dao (huì dào)**. Upon **first glimpsing the Imperial Sutra (yī dǔ Dì jīng)**, he **received its rare and precious truths (shèng huò zhēn yì)**. He **then meticulously studied each character (jí zhú zì yǐ jīng yán)**, hoping to **grasp enlightenment through its words (jì yīn wén ér liǎo wù)**. But since **the sacred texts lack annotations (shèng diǎn wú zhù)**, **true comprehension is difficult (tǐ rèn wéi nán)**.

Your humble servant **devotedly seeks sincere understanding (shēn zhì fā chóng qián)**, **exploring its multifaceted meanings (bó fāng jiě yì)**. He **compiled the Immortals’ and Saints’ sayings (xù zhuàn xiān shèng gé yán)**, **incorporating them into the Daoist Canon (huì rù Dào zàng hán bù)**. For the **three volumes of the true text (yīn sān juàn zhī zhēn wén)**, he **collected and arranged their sequence (yòng jí xù cì)**; for the **five grades of secret teachings (wù pǐn zhī mì lùn)**, he **listed them under chapter titles (yǐ liè piān míng)**. The **ten volumes (juàn biān wéi shí)** total **six hundred sheets (fú jì liù bǎi)**, **encompassing one hundred and eighteen chapters (zǒng liè yībǎi shíbā zhāng)**, with **over tenfold myriad words (dà luè shí yuè wàn yán)**.

The **heart-laws of a thousand sages (qiān shèng xīn fǎ)** **shine forth in these volumes (shǔ cè zhāo rán)**; the **vast sufferings and profound principles (hào jié xuán zōng)** **are visible at a glance (jǔ mù rú zài)**. Though your humble servant **cannot yet fathom the secrets of the Highest Sage (wèi néng dú kuī shàng shèng zhī yùn ào)**, he **hopes to at least enable others to witness the most exalted true texts (shì zhòng shí wén)**. **Even a small effort has its effect (cùn láo jì xiào)**; **a good connection may yet endure (liáng yuán ruò cún)**.

**With humble devotion (qiān jí)** to the **auspicious morning (cháo)** and **reverent diligence (qián kè)**, he **provides benefit to those of good faith (zī shàn xìn yǐ xié chéng)**. **The preface of this petition (yù zòu shū cí)**, **presented to the Mystic Judgment (shàng gān xuán jiàn)**, **augments the Emperor and people’s purity (zēng jūn mín qīng jìng zhī fú)** and **pardon the Small Dao Master’s presumption (shè xiǎo zhào jiàn wàng zhī zuì)**. May it **illuminate all realms and directions (shǐ zhū jiè duō fāng)** with the **seventeenfold radiance (shí qī guāng míng zhī zhào chè)**; may it **span past and future (jué jīn qīng gǔ)** and **immerse all in the thirtyfold great vows (shí sān shí dà yuàn zhī táo róng)**. May all **ascend to the Heavy Mystic (zhòng xuán)** and **eternally benefit from the law’s blessings (míng yáng yǒng zhān fǎ lì)**. Though your humble servant’s **sincerity is but a fraction (shǒu shēn xuán zhēng zhī chéng)****,** it **slightly fulfills its purpose (shǎo shēn wàn yī yǐ)**.

**Respectfully submitted (jǐn zòu)**.

Regarding the **meaning, annotations, and chapter arrangement of the sutra (jīng zhù míng yì xù cì kǎo)**:
*The original text sometimes appears as **one volume (zuò yī juàn zhě)****,** following the **model of the Supreme Ultimate (xiàng Tài jí)**. Others divide it into **three volumes (fēn sān juàn zhě)****,** symbolizing the **Three Talents (sān cái)**. Now, this annotation **comprises ten volumes (jīn zhù zuò shí juàn)****,** representing the **tenfold Supreme Ultimate (shí jí zhī yì)**—for the **Dao’s numbers are complete in ten (dào shù chéng yú shí)**. The **five grades (wù pǐn)** symbolize the **Five Phases (wǔ xíng)**. When the **Five Phases, Four Symbols (sì xiàng), and Eight Trigrams (bā guà)** are combined, they yield **seventeen (dé shí qī)**—all **divisions of the Supreme Ultimate (jiē Tài jí zhī fēn)**. Thus, the **Emperor attains the seventeenfold radiance (Dì yú shí qī guāng míng)**; **Heaven is born (Tiān yǐ shēng)** and **Earth is perfected (dì yǐ chéng)**.

The **Jade Emperor’s (Yù Dìshì)** **sutra is the **Earth’s (dì)** **curved completion of all things (qū chéng wàn wù)**. Earth’s **numbers are thirty (dì shù sān shí)****,** so the Emperor **manifests thirty kinds of virtue (shì sān shí zhǒng gōng dé)**. The **Emperor’s virtue surpasses the tenfold Supreme Ultimate (Dì dé chāo chū shí jí)****,** hence the **ten titles (jù shí hào)**. After **cultivating for countless kalpas (xiū yì wàn jié)****,** he **embodies the ten thousand virtues (zhōu wàn dé)**. Now, this **six-hundred-sheet annotation (liù bǎi fú zhù)** **mirrors the Fire Scripture’s six hundred chapters (xiàng huǒ jì liù bǎi piān)**; the **one hundred and eighteen chapters (yībǎi shíbā zhāng)** **follow the Emperor’s eighteen hundred precepts (cóng Dì qiān bā bǎi jiè)**. The **tenfold myriad words (shí wàn yú yán)** **reflect the Emperor’s ten thousand wondrous and mystic deeds (xiàng Dì shí wàn miào xíng xuán guāng)**.

As for the so-called *Imperial Sutra Annotation (Huáng jīng zhuàn)*, your humble servant fears that **the lowly and ignorant (xià yú)** **cannot fully align with the sacred text (bù néng quán qì shèng wén)**. He **summarizes the essentials (jǔ dà yào)** to **instruct others (yǐ zhào rù)**. Knowing this **intent (yì)****,** how could there be **divergent interpretations (bù tóng zhī zhǐ)**?

Regarding **contemplation, recitation, and exposition of the sutra’s precepts and teachings (guān sòng jiǎng shòu jīngdiǎn jiè yì)**:
**When observing or reciting any sutra (fán guān sòng zhū jīng)**, or **lecturing and transmitting its teachings (huò jiǎng míng shòu jiè)**, one must first **fast and purify oneself (zhāi míng zhěng yī)**, **adorn oneself in proper attire (yī zhuóng)****,** and **reverently place the sutra on a clean table (sù róng qǐng jīng zhì jìng qǐ shàng)**. **Sitting upright and steadying one’s mind (duān zuò dìng zhì)****,** one should **forget both good and evil (shàn è liǎng wàng)****,** **abandon all vehicles (yī chéng bù lì)****,** and **att

**Copying Sutra Precepts**
For all who copy the sutras, the ritual observances are the same as for recitation. With a rectified mind and a true pen, it is not for the sake of fine calligraphy—this very act is the Dao itself.

**Distinguishing Similar and Divergent Names of the Sutra**
Carefully examining *Baopuzi* states: *"The Highest Above"* refers to the sovereign of all sentient beings, reaching the utmost limits of Heaven—its height is unmatched, corresponding to the Buddhist term *non-retrogression* (不退转之地).

The *Jade Emperor* is the most revered among the Saints and the most noble among the Gods. All Buddhas and Holy Teachers, all Celestial Emperors, thus earn the title *Jade Emperor*.

*Lü Dongbin* says: *"Dao supreme and peerless is called Emperor."*

The *Most High Emperor* is boundless in benevolence and trust, surpassing all previous sages in perfect virtue and beauty—praise for Him is endless.

His station is in *Yuqing* (玉清), proclaiming the transformations of *Yuan Shi* (元始), hence the title *Jade Emperor*.

*Han Xiang* says: *"The Original Conduct"* recounts the Jade Emperor’s sacred roots and the cultivation of wondrous practices.

*The Collected Sutra* gathers the five wondrous utterances of *Yuan Shi* into one text, showing posterity the true path of practice.

*Guanshan* says: *"Only Heaven is supreme,"* for the Jade Emperor’s abode is the highest Heaven, surpassing all others, hence *"Highest Above."*

Men see the Jade Emperor’s grandeur and assume His virtue is absolute, beyond mortal reach. Yet the Holy Dao knows no division—I stand equal to the Most Holy.

The Emperor’s majesty, His marvels—these are achieved through conduct.

Thus, *Tian Shū* Zhang Shangling transmitted this text, urging men to emulate the Sage and attain True Reality.

The clear decree states: *"The Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct and Collected Sutra"* is meant for men to observe, attain enlightenment, trace the roots of merit, follow the Most Holy, and thus become *Shang Zhen* (上真).

Later, it was also called *"The Taishang Dongxuan Lingbao Scripture"*—speaking of the Great Beyond measure, the Highest Beyond reach, hence *Taishang*. It expounds the primordial *De* and *Dao*, serving as the eternal foundation of all scripture. It penetrates the Three *Jing* (景), revealing profound mysteries, hence *Dongxuan*. The essence of *Xuanling* is the eternal treasure of Heaven and man, hence *Lingbao*.

In essence, the scripture clarifies the Dao, and the Dao belongs to my very self. If man fulfills his nature and attains his destiny, comprehending this Dao, tracing its roots, and embodying it in conduct—then he may enter Sainthood.

**Belief in Scripture and the Discrimination of Ascension and Depravity**
From *Taiji*, man is born and transformed. Heavenly paradises and hellish realms are detailed in the scriptures—yet the world does not believe. Is this mere fabrication?

Though death returns to emptiness, what does not perish is the *hun* (魂) bound by deeds. *Bo You* became a ghostly calamity; *Zi Chan* believed him, and the Master did not deem it false. Are there no hells?

Purified rebirth returns to the cycle of creation; heavenly paradises exist as well. Yet blessings cannot be begged for, and karmic retribution cannot be evaded. Heavenly paradises and hells are shaped by human intent.

If one believes in these doctrines by name but does not cultivate virtue, he invites disaster himself. Even if he speaks daily of retribution, what good will it do?

For those who recite the scriptures, there are pure-hearted incantations—these are omitted here. Since earlier teachings aligned the heart with the Dao, this very recitation is the true incantation, so their texts are not recorded.

The original *Huangjing* (皇经) first listed thirty-six sacred titles, following the meaning of *"thirty-six from Heaven."* Now the scripture retains only ten precepts—why? The ten titles represent the ten extremes, used as the Emperor’s designation. It is not a matter of omitting due to brevity or inclusion. The observer should ponder this carefully.

**Commentary on the *Highest Above Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct and Collected Sutra***
This meaning is the *Dongxuan Lingbao*’s paired exposition—later generations should not doubt it.

**Long Kneeling and Reverent Adoration**
This scripture expounds the Jade Emperor’s wondrous conduct as revealed by *Yuan Shi*, so those who recite it must kneel in long reverence, offering sincere devotion.

**Supplication to the Three Pure Ones**
I humbly address the Three Pure Realms—the supreme, unmatched Three Pure Ones. Knowing the Dao’s height and the Three Pure’s grandeur, I sincerely aspire, surrendering body, spirit, and destiny, ascending to the True Heart.

**Gazing Up in Reverence**
I supplicate the *Yuqing* (玉清), the *Shangqing* (上清), and the *Taiqing* (太清).

The Three Pure Realms are the most exalted:
- *Yuqing* is the sacred realm of *Yuan Shi*,
- *Shangqing* is the true realm of *Lingbao*,
- *Taiqing* is the immortal realm of *De* and *Dao*—
the Three Pure Ancestors, the Great Celestial Worthy.

**Supplication to the Great Luo Heaven**
The boundless celestial expanse where life originates.

*Lü Dongbin* says: *"The Jade Emperor’s abode is the sovereign of the three thousand great thousand worlds, never retrogressing. Supreme beyond compare, hence *Great Luo* (大罗)."*

The *Xuan Qióng* (玄穹) Master—vast and solemn—is the sovereign of all celestial assemblies.

**Supplication to the Three Pure Realms and the Attendant Divine Multitude**
*Zhang Ziyang* says: *"Attendant"* means standing beside. *"Divine"* refers to the lofty, ineffable realm beyond sight or hearing. *"Multitude"* means all—
the *Nine Divine Ones of Primordial Heaven*, the *Heavenly Saints of Later Heaven*, all gods, Buddhas, bodhisattvas, *Arhats*, and *Vajrasattvas*—all are present here.

**The Marvelous Dao Beyond Conception**
The most marvelous, supreme Dao—
the highest vehicle—
cannot be grasped by thought,
cannot be spoken of,
is beyond conception.

**Entering the Mysterious Gate**
*Zhang Zifang* says: *"Entering"* means attaining through true knowledge and practice. *"Mysterious Gate"* is the gate of Daoic principle.

The myriad marvels of profound mystery are difficult to enter, yet through gradual enlightenment, one enters the Mysterious Gate.

This is what *Mencius* called *"dwelling in it securely, then drawing from it deeply,"* and the scriptures say: *"Hearing and thinking alone, without practice, leads to emptiness."*

**The Sutra’s Marvelous Sound and Profound Essence**
*"Loft"* (抉) means to decide, to extract. *"Profound Essence"* is the unfathomable mystery.

This marvelous scripture extracts divine inspiration from the true realm—this is the extraction of profound essence.

**Guiding the Dust-Ensnared to the Path**
*Yuan Shi* expounds the marvelous scripture, extracts the profound essence, and guides the dust-bound, lost souls out of the sea of suffering, freeing them from their karmic bonds.

**I Now Purify the Three Karmas**
*"I"* refers to those who read or recite the scripture. *"Three Karmas"* are bodily, verbal, and mental deeds. *"Purify"* means sincere devotion, permanently abandoning these deeds.

*(The recitation continues with) mouth and heart in unison.*

The devotee who recites this scripture speaks with true sincerity.
With mouth chanting and true heart receiving,
I humbly pray for boundless compassion—
May the Great Compassion open to accept my plea.
*"Compassion"*—one variant reads *"Reverence"*—but *"Compassion"* is correct.
In reciting this scripture, I humbly pray that Yuan Shi, the Jade Emperor, and all the Celestial Worthies extend their boundless compassion, reveal their merciful countenance, and accept my supplication.
If *"Reverence"* were used, it could not carry the meaning of the preceding three petitions.

May the radiant compassion illuminate my humble unworthiness,
May the Divine Hearing listen to my devotional chant.
May the sacred light of all Saints shine upon my sincere, lowly heart,
And may the Divine Hearing attend to the sounds of my offerings and recitation.
May my recitation resound through the Ten Directions—
When I recite the scripture, may the Dharma-sound echo through the Ten Directions, so that all beings in the Ten Directions may hear and believe in the Great Law.

May all my wishes be fulfilled,
As the scripture describes.
May I attain enlightenment through this scripture and cultivate the Dao,
Fulfilling all virtuous aspirations,
Just as the scripture recounts the Jade Emperor’s wondrous deeds across kalpas.

From this point onward, may I gradually progress in cultivation,
Achieving the Great Dao and serving the Celestial Saints.
From this moment, may I steadily advance in my practice,
Realizing the Great Way and paying homage to the Immortals and Saints.

With utmost sincerity, I bow and entrust myself—
Though my devotion may not yet be perfect,
If my heart is not fully devoted, even a slight regret would not be true surrender.
In reciting this scripture, I vow eternal sincerity without wavering in my practice, hence the phrase *"With utmost sincerity, I bow and entrust myself."*

To the Pure and Refined Celestial Realm—
Yuan Shi, the Most Exalted and Unparalleled,
The Sovereign of the Central Heaven,
Supreme over Immortals and Buddhas,
Whose abode is eternal and unspoiled—this is the Pure and Refined Celestial Realm.
The Celestial Palace of *Qingwei*. *(To be clarified in subsequent revelation.)*

Within the **Yùluó Xiāotái** (Jade Emperor’s Lofty Hall),
At the **Jǐngshàng** (Supreme Pinnacle) of the utmost heights,
A heaven within the heavens, radiant and fragrant with divine light,
Serene and truly pure—
Thus it is spoken of as **Yùluó Xiāotái**’s realm.

Above the **Sēnluó Jìnghóng** (Forest of Ten Thousand Things, Pure and Boundless),
Where resounds the vast and profound **Dharma** (Teachings),
So deep that it cannot be fully exhausted—
The heavens encompass myriad phenomena, profound and unfathomable,
Yet **Yùqīng** (Jade Purity) stands above all heavens.
Thus it is spoken of as above the **Sēnluó Jìnghóng**.

The **Míngxiǎn** (Manifested Form) is its **Fànxiàng** (Dharma Manifestation),
**Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn** (The Most Exalted Sovereign of Primordial Beginning),
As the **Zōng** (Founder) of the **Sānjiào** (Three Teachings),
Illuminating and transforming all beings,
Whose wonders are inexhaustible—
This is the **Míngxiǎn** (Manifested Form) of the **Yìfàn Miàoxiàng** (Ten Billions of Buddhas, Marvelous Manifestation).
Possessing the **Shéntōng** (Divine Penetration) of **Wújí** (Boundlessness).
Possessing the **Shéntōng** (Divine Penetration) of boundless magnitude.

It is said: *Yuánshǐ* (Primordial Beginning) is the **Wújí Dàdào** (Boundless Great Dao/Way),
Thus it is spoken of as such.
Expounding the **Zhēn Xuán** (True Mysterious),
Breaking the hindrances of **Wúyǒu sèkōng** (Non-existence, Form, and Emptiness);
Expounding and propagating widely,
Illuminating and elucidating the **Zhìzhēn Xuánzōng** (Ultimate True Mysterious Principle).
Breaking the worldly hindrances of **wúyǒu sèkōng** (non-existence, existence, form, and emptiness).
The **wú** (non-existence) is the principle of non-duality;
The **yǒu** (existence) is the indulgence in life;
The **sè** (form) is the attachment to existence;
The **kōng** (emptiness) is the failure to transcend **wúyǒu** (non-existence and existence).

*Yuánshǐ* (Primordial Beginning) in this **Sūtra** (Scripture),
Illuminates the **Zhēn Xuán** (True Mysterious),
Not confined to the **Sān guān** (Three Observations),
Nor trapped in the **Liǎng jì** (Two Realms).
Directly pointing to the **Rúrú Jiànchéng** (Thusness, Realization).
Thus breaking the hindrances of **wúyǒu sèkōng** (non-existence, existence, form, and emptiness),
And leading to the **Mìao** (Marvelous Dao/Way).
Rescuing and elevating all **Qùlèi** (Emotional Karmic Types),
Severing the divisions of **Zhìyú gāoxià** (Wisdom and Folly, High and Low).
Rescuing and elevating all beings of emotional karmic types, freeing them from dust,
Not discriminating between ancient and modern, saints and fools—
All can practice the **Dàodào** (Dao/Way).
This is the **Mìao fǎ** (Marvelous Law) of **Zhēnyī Wú'èr** (True Oneness, Non-duality),
Severing all distinctions of wisdom and folly, high and low.
Marvelous applications beyond measure,
Mysterious **Língjī** (Spiritual Mechanisms) beyond reckoning.
The **Zhìshèng Miàoyòng** (Supreme Saint’s Marvelous Applications) have no bounds,
Difficult to perceive, and the **Xuánlíng Dàojī** (Mysterious Spirit’s Dao Mechanisms) are beyond calculation.

With **Dàbēi Dàyuàn** (Great Compassion, Great Aspiration),
**Dàshèng Dàcí** (Great Saintliness, Great Benevolence),
**Wúliàng dùrén** (Boundless Salvation),
*Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn* (The Most Exalted Sovereign of Primordial Beginning).
Great Compassion—deep pity for the world;
Great Aspiration—endless transformation;
Great Saintliness—the most exalted among saints;
Great Benevolence—salvation without end.
Boundless Salvation—without limit.

The phrase of *Yuánshǐ*—to be clarified in subsequent revelation.

**Zhìxīn Guìmìng Lǐ** (With Utmost Sincerity, I Bow and Entrust Myself—Homage)
This is the declaration for those who **recite and contemplate** the **Sūtra** (Scripture),
With true heart paying homage to the Most Exalted.
Those who merely **mouth this phrase** today are not the same.

**Shàngqīng Zhēnjìng** (Upper Purity True Realm),
**Jǐngshàng Xuánqīng** (Supreme Pinnacle Mysterious Purity),
The **Zhìzhēn Miàojìng** (Ultimate True Mysterious Marvelous Realm).

The **Yuánshǐ** Celestial Palace of the **Yǔyú** (Primordial Jade).

From its beginning, **qīng** (Azure) becomes **tàibái** (Great White),
where **xuán** (Mysterious) light transforms into the **miào** (Marvelous) realm of **shénhuà** (Divine Manifestation),
eternally undestroyed, towering beyond measure, with **shén yùn** (Divine Motion) boundless.
The **Sūtra** speaks of the **Yuánbái** (Primordial White) **Yǔyú** Celestial Palace.
Within the **Zǐwēi Qióngtái** (Jade Pivot Celestial Terrace),
the **miào** (Marvelous) realm is unfathomable, forever unshaken—hence the name **Zǐwēi**.
Not the **Northern Dipper** (Beihxīn) **Zǐwēi Enclosure** (yuán).
The **Qióngtái** (Celestial Terrace) **Shàngqīng** (Upper Purity) Palace radiance,
adorned with countless **bǎo** (treasures), stands within the **Qióngtái**.
Above the **Xuándū Yùjīng** (Mysterious Capital Jade Capital).
**Shàngqīng** (Upper Purity), situated beyond the **Tài Xuándū Bái Yùjīng** (Great Mysterious Capital White Jade Capital).
A single word refers to the **Yùjīngshān** (Jade Capital Mountain) above the lofty heavens—also acceptable.

It connects with the **statutes** (xì) of the **Yuánshǐ Xūhuáng** (Primordial Beginning Void Emperor),
where **xì** (系, pronounced *xì* as in "下记切") means *continuation* (to inherit).
The **Língbǎo** (Soul-Treasure) body embodies the **Yuánxíng Huà** (Primordial Conduct Transformation),
thus ascending to inherit the **Yuánshǐ Xūhuáng** **Dàotǒng Shìxì** (Dao/Way lineage and succession).

It surpasses the **roots and origins** (gēnmiáo) of the **Xīnà Yùguó** (Western Jade Realm).
The **Sūtra** examines **Xīnà Yùguó** in Shaanxi’s **Xīnà** (Western Jade),
the birthplace of the **White Sovereign** (Báidì) in the west—
**Língbǎo** precedes all **saints’** (shèng) transformations,
thus it is said to transcend the **roots and origins** of **Xīnà Yùguó**.
One must not conflate **Yuánbái** (元白) with **Báidì** (白帝).
Some say *supercedes* (chāo) should be *inherits* (shào),
but the **Celestial Sovereign** (Tiānzūn) is not the **roots and origins** of **Xīnà Yùguó**—incorrect.

Entering the **shǔmǐ zhū** (glutinous millet pearls),
absorbing the **quánzhì** (complete) essence of **Zhēn Xuán** (True Mysterious).
The **Celestial Sovereign** (Tiānzūn) enters the **shǔmǐ Xuánzhū** (glutinous millet Mysterious Pearls).
This is the **Confucian** **jiǔróng Tàijí** (nine transformations of the Great Ultimate)
and the **Buddhist** **wù zhèngfǎ yǎnzàng** (awakening to the true Dharma-eye treasury).
**Quánzhì** (挹, *to extract fully*), penetrating this **Dao** (道) alone,
like the world’s grasp of rare treasures—
sated in the **ultimate taste** (zhìwèi), hence it is said:
to exhaustively extract the **Zhēn Xuán** (True Mysterious) essence—**quánzhì** (精粹) and **huágǔ** (refined perfection).

Within the **Xiānglín Yuàn** (Fragrant Grove Garden),
frequently expounding the **mìyào** (secret) **Zhēn** (True) **significant principles** (yàojiào) in the form of **qiāntí** (fishing net) and **bǔtì** (hare’s foot).
The **Celestial Sovereign** (Tiānzūn) resides in the **Shàngqīng Miàoxiāng Bǎolín Xuányuàn** (Upper Purity Marvelous Fragrant Treasure Grove Mysterious Garden),
often elucidating the **xuánmì** (Mysterious Secret) **Zhēn** (True) **yàojiào** (significant principles) through **qiāntí** (fishing nets) and **bǔtì** (hare’s feet).
The **Dao** (道) is inherently unsaid,
but the **Sūtra** (经) provides the **path of practice** (xiūxíng jìnglù).
It is like the **fishing net** (qiān) for catching fish,
or the **hare’s foot** (tí) for trapping hares—
tools that cannot be permanently held,
hence the **Sūtra** is likened to **qiāntí** (fishing nets and hare’s feet).
The **miàodé** (Marvelous Virtue/Power) is beyond thought,
and the **shéntōng** (Divine Abilities) are beyond imitation.

The **Celestial Sovereign**’s (Tiānzūn) **miàodé** (Marvelous Virtue/Power) defies contemplation,
and **shéntōng** (Divine Abilities) cannot be replicated.

The **Great Compassion and Great Aspiration** (Dàbēi Dàyuàn) of the **Great Sage and Great Benevolence** (Dàshèng Dàcí) are boundless in liberating beings—
as previously expounded (Jiějiàn qián).

**Lingbao Tianzūn** (灵宝天尊).
At first, **Qīng** (青) reaches **Taibai** (太白),
and **Yuánshǐ** (元始) again manifests the **Marvelous Transformation** (Miàohuà).
Dwelling in **Shangqing** (上清),
**Lingbao** moves with boundless efficacy (Wúfāng),
a **treasure of the Dao** (Dàodào fǎbǎo) passed on without end.
Thus, it is **Lingbao Tianzūn** (灵宝天尊).

With **sincere reverence** (Zhìxīn guīmìng lǐ),
he pays homage to the **Supreme Purity’s** (Tàiqīng xiānjìng)
**Celestial Realm** (Xianjìng),
the **Great Vermilion Heavenly Palace** (Dàchì Tiān gōng).

The **Three Purity Domains** (Sānqīng jìngtiān) and the **Heavenly Palaces** (Gōng) are originally one,
illuminated by **Mysterious Light** (Xuánguāng) in boundless splendor (Wúqióngjìn),
hence the **Supreme Purity’s Celestial Realm** (Tàiqīng xiānjìng).
**Yuánbái** (元白) scatters **ethereal mists** (Sǎnxiá),
while **Chìxiáng** (赤祥) pervades all—
eternally unspoiled and undiminished (Yǒngwú huǐlún),
thus called the **Great Vermilion Heavenly Palace** (Dàchì Tiān gōng).
This is not merely the **red hue** (Chìhóng) of color.

The **lofty Golden Gate** (Wēiwēi Jīnquè) stands high,
and the **vast Nine Heavens** (Chóngxiāo) stretch boundlessly above.
The **Supreme Sage** (Tàishàng) dwells in **lofty immobility** (Wēiwēi bùdòng),
the **most exalted and supreme** (Zuìshàng Zhìdà).
Without peer or equal (Wúbǐlún),
his **Golden Light** (Jīnguāng) is unspoiled.
The **Mysterious Gate** (Xuànquè) stands high and vast,
difficult to fathom (Wúqióng).
He eternally resides in the **Nine Celestial Enclosures** (Jiǔchén),
**Ninefold Layers** (Jiǔchóng),
and **Nine Heavens** (Jiǔxiāo) above.
Some say: **crowned above the Thirty-Six Heavens** (Sānshíliù Tiān chóngxiāo).
Born in the **infinite kalpas** (Wúliàngshù jié),
the **Supreme Sage** (Tàishàng) traverses kalpas in **transformative activity** (Xínghuà),
without measure or end (Wúliàngshù),
unfathomable and unexhausted (Bùkē qióngtàn).
The **Mysterious Source of the Dao** (Dàodào xuánzōng) is thus born in **infinite kalpas** (Wúliàngshù jié).

He expounds the **Dharma** (Shìfǎ) across **twelve thousand heavens** (Wàn èrqiān tiān).
The **Supreme Sage** (Tàishàng) has traversed kalpas,
manifesting throughout the **Three Thousand Great Thousands** (Sānqiān Dàqiān).
This refers to his **Dharma expounding in twelve thousand heavens** (Shìfǎ wàn èrqiān tiān),
where the **Supreme Sage’s** (Tàishàng) **Dharma assemblies** (Shìfǎ guān) extend to **twelve thousand heavenly realms** (Wàn èrqiān tiān jiè).

**Five Thousand Mysterious Teachings** (Wǔqiān mìyán),
blending the **Marvelous Dao of the Three Realms** (Sān-cái miàodào);
The **Dao** (Dào) possesses **five thousand** (Wǔqiān) **Mysterious Teachings** (Mìyán),
permeating the **three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity** (Tiān-dì-rén sān-cái).

**Eighty-One Transformations** (Bāshìyī huà),
guiding beings of the **Six Paths** (Liùqù) to liberation.
**Eighty-One Transformations** (Bāshìyī huà),
leading and guiding the **six classes of beings**—**celestial, human, asura, demon, hellish, and animal** (Tiān-rén-móguǐ-yùchú liù děngqù)—
or some say: the **six paths of desire**—**sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mind** (Yǎn-ěr-bí-shé-shēn-yì liùqù)—
or the **Six Paths of Existence**—**having, non-having, form, formlessness, cognizer, and cognized** (Yǒu-wú-sè-kōng-néng-suǒ liùqù).
Some derive it from **拯** (Zhěng),
to **rescue and awaken beings to the True Dao** (Zhěngjiù wùdào chéngzhēn).
The **Six Paths** (Liùqù) are difficult to escape,
yet the **Supreme Sage** (Tàishàng) descends in **compassionate instruction** (Cíyǐ jiàohuà),
employing **divine methods** (Shìjì) to liberate **sentient beings, ghosts, and spirits** (Shénrén guǐwù) from dust.
Hence, it is also called **拯** (Zhěng).

His **Sage’s Virtue** (Shèngdé) is exalted,
and his **Mysterious Function** (Xuán-gōng) is vast.
The **Supreme Sage’s** (Tàishàng) **Sage’s Virtue** (Shèngdé) is **lofty and revered** (Zōnggāo lónggāo),
his **Mysterious Function** (Xuán-gōng) **universally vast and profound** (Pǔguǎng bódà),
deep and unfathomable (Shēnhòu mòqióng).
Thus, it is called **Mysterious Function** (Xuán-gōng).

The **Great Compassion and Great Aspiration** (Dàbēi Dàyuàn),
the **Great Sage and Great Benevolence** (Dàshèng Dàcí),
boundless in liberating beings—
as previously expounded (Jiějiàn qián).

The **Born-in-Heaven Celestial Sovereign** (Jiàngshēng Tiānzūn).
The **Supreme Sage** (Tàishàng) manifests **infinite transformations** (Xiǎnhuà wúliàng),
his **compassionate grace** (Cí’ēn) is endless,
eternally generating without cessation (Shēngshēng bùyǐ),
hence called the **Born-in-Heaven Celestial Sovereign** (Jiàngshēng Tiānzūn).

With **sincere reverence** (Zhìxīn guīmìng lǐ),
he pays homage to the **True Realm of Marvelous Existence** (Miàoyǒu zhēnjìng),
the **Palace of Míluó** (Míluó shànggōng).
The **Palace** (Shànggōng) is the **name of the Holy Sovereign’s** (Yùdì Shèngfù) **Celestial Abode** (Gōngmíng).

In past kalpas, he was revealed as the **body of a sovereign king** (Xiàngshǐ xiànwáng zhī shēn).

In ancient times, he manifested in the radiant and wondrous **Light-Strong Joyful King** (Guāngyán Miàolè Wáng) form—
this being the essence of the **Root Sovereign** (Běnběn Dìzūn),
the very substance of the **Supreme Holy Sovereign of Ten Thousand Heavens** (Wàn Tiān Shèngdì Cízūn).

At first, his form was serene and still—
the **Holy Father** (Shèngfù), the **Origin of Dao Transformation** (Dàohuà Zōngshǐ),
his wondrous form ever pure, motionless in stillness.
Truly profound, supremely mysterious, and ineffable—
this primordial stillness, truly profound and distant,
most divine and wondrous, yet beyond speech or discourse.

In succession, he ascended the throne, transmitting the lineage—
his virtue unmatched, unparalleled, and ever succeeding.
He inherited the **Light-Strong King’s sovereign position** (Guāngyán Guó Jūn wèi),
continuing the royal lineage, his virtue surpassing all others in kind.
Following the ancestral deeds, his virtue and blessings grew ever more vast—
thus it is said: *wondrous, unmatched, unparalleled, and ever succeeding.*

The **Holy Father’s** compassionate and merciful parent,
the **Supreme Most-High** (Zuìshàng Zuìshàngzūn).
The **Jade Sovereign** (Yùdì) is called the **Compassionate Parent of All Beings** (Zhòngshēng Cífù),
his station the most exalted.
The **Holy Father** refers to the **Jade Sovereign**—
the **Light-Strong King** gave birth to the **Jade Sovereign**, thus the **Holy Father’s** compassionate and merciful parent,
the **Supreme Most-High**.

Praise is boundless, devotion endless—
the **King-born Jade Sovereign**’s merits are eternal.
Thus praise is boundless, devotion without end.

The **Great Compassionate, Great-Vowed Parent-Heaven Sovereign** (Dàbēi Dàyuàn Fù Tiānzūn),
the **Great Sage, Great-Compassionate Light-Strong Joyful King Holy Father Heaven Sovereign** (Dàshèng Dàcí Guāngyán Miàolè Wáng Shèngfù Tiānzūn).
Here, the **Holy Father** refers to the **Light-Strong King**, for he gave birth to the **Most Holy**.

With **sincere reverence**, he pays homage to the **True Realm of Marvelous Existence** (Miàoyǒu zhēnjìng),
the **Palace of Míluó’s Inner Sanctum** (Míluó Nèigōng).
The **Inner Sanctum** is the **Jade Sovereign’s** deepest palace, where the **Holy Mother** resides—
thus it is called the **Inner Sanctum**.

Her **compassionate countenance** shines like the harmonious spring sun,
her **virtuous bearing** stern as the solemn autumn frost.
Her **pure Dao-qi** (Zhēnqiàn fènqì) existed before Heaven and Earth;
her **perfect emptiness and Dao-qi** (Xūwú fènqì) subtly prefigured existence before the cosmos.
She manifested her wondrous form through successive consorts,
giving birth to the **Sovereign** in due time.
She bore the **embryonic essence of the One Qi** (Yīqì pèitāi zhī shǐ),
revealing the beginning of embryonic formation—
*embryo* (pèi), when form and qi first take shape;
*tāi*, when form and qi gradually manifest.
She embodied the **Sovereign’s** unique generative transformation,
rooted in the **Origin of Ten Thousand Transformations** (Wànhuà Zǔgēn),
the **Compassionate Mother of All Beings** (Zhòngshēng Címǔ).

Great in compassion and vow, great in sagehood and mercy—
the **Precious Moonlight Empress** (Bǎoyuè Guāng Huánghòu), the **Holy Mother Prime Sovereign** (Yuánjūn Shèngmǔ).

With **sincere reverence**, he pays homage to the **Purple-Gold Celestial Gate** (Zǐjīn Jīnquè),
the **White Jade Jade-Capital** (Bái Yù Yùjīng).
The **Purple-Gold Gate** and the **Yellow-Gold Gate** are not two—
the **Sovereign’s** celestial palace, its divine light and treasures unmatched,
a perpetual abode of purity.
The **Yellow-Gold Gate** is where he rests in splendor.
The **Purple-Gold Gate** is where he resides in majesty.
The **double splendor of gold and jade** is fitting praise.

Dwelling in the **Realm of Marvelous Existence** (Zhù Miàoyǒu zhī jìngzhōng),
[abiding in the **Heaven of Supreme Truth** (Chǔ Xuánzhēn zhī tiānshàng)].
Ever residing in the boundless, traceless true realm,
permanently dwelling in the **Supreme Mysterious True Heaven** above.
His **Dao accomplished, his virtue complete**—
thus his wondrous form surpasses all heavens.
The **Universal Teacher of Ten Thousand Heavens, the Jade Sovereign** (Yùhuáng Wàn Tiān Jiàozhǔ),
therefore crowned above all heavens.
His **heart vast, his body plump**—
thus his compassionate light pervades the Three Realms.
His **nature is boundless as Heaven**—
his wondrous body ever thus—
his heart inherently vast, his body inherently plump.
Since mortals cannot, there is no light.
When the **Jade Sovereign** attained the Dao,
his heart was as boundless as the **Great Void** (Tàixū),
his Dao-body naturally radiant—
thus his compassionate light illuminates the Three Realms.

His station is exalted, surpassing all that is supreme—
his position unmatched, hence *supreme above all supreme*.
His Dao is mysterious, profound beyond profundity—
the **Jade Sovereign’s** Dao is exalted and unfathomable,
truly *mysterious beyond mystery*.
The **True Holy Originator** (Zhēnshèng Zōngshī), the **reliance of Heaven and humankind**.

Great in compassion and vow, great in sagehood and mercy—
(as expounded in separate chapters).

The **Vault-of-Heaven Holy King** (Qióngcāng Shèngwáng),
the **Great Heaven Sovereign Jade Emperor** (Dà Tiānzūn Yùhuáng).

The **Vault-of-Heaven Holy Sovereign** is the **Clan King of All Heavens**—
this title extols the **Jade Sovereign’s** exaltation.

With **sincere reverence**, he pays homage to the **Light-Strong Kingdom within the Wondrous Joyful Land** (Guāngyán Guówèi Miàolè Tǔzhōng).
(as expounded in later annotations).

The **Holy Mother** concentrated her spirit in a dream within the void—
the **Holy Mother** dreamed the **Dao Lord** (Dàojūn) handed her an infant,
thus giving birth to the **Jade Sovereign**.
This was a **divine dream** (Shéndòng) within the void,
though its auspicious marvel was extraordinary.
The **Dao Lord** bestowed the **Jade Essence** (Yùzhì) in a hazy, distant realm.
Her **compassionate and yielding demeanor** was profound—
her benevolent affection, her gentle humility.

The **Vault-of-Heaven Holy Sovereign** does not covet the exalted honor of the **Ten-Thousand-Chariot Sovereignty**—
the **Ten-Thousand-Chariot** refers to the great realm where a state dispatches ten thousand chariots.
The **Jade Sovereign** renounced the **Kingly Position**,
thus not coveting the honor and glory of the **Ten-Thousand-Chariot Lord’s** sovereignty.
With **enduring forbearance** and **virtuous gentleness**, he bore no weariness in the **infinite kalpas** of cultivation and practice.
Enduring all humiliation with **virtue and tenderness**,
he never faltered in the **infinite kalpas** of refining his **power** and walking the **Dao**.

His **power** surpasses all comparison,
his **virtue** profound, impossible to surpass.
His **deeds** and **practice** transcend all ranks,
his **benevolent virtue** surpasses all bounds—
thus his **power** is exalted beyond measure,
his **virtue** vast, beyond all crossing.

With **Great Compassion** and **Great Aspiration**,
**Great Sageliness** and **Great Benevolence**,
he manifests a body of **boundless virtue**—
the **Great Heavenly Sovereign** (Yùhuáng Dàtīanzūn).
This title extols the **Jade Sovereign’s** great **virtue**.

With **sincere reverence**, he pays homage and ascends to the **Imperial Seat**,
dwelling high in the **Celestial Palace** of the **Pure and Mysterious Realm**.
He **pervasively wanders** through all **White Jade Capitals**,
pervasively traversing and inspecting all **Great Heavenly Palaces**—
the **White Jade Capitals** indeed.
He **universally manifests** within the **Ten Directions’ Golden Gates**—
universally pervading and widely manifesting in the **Golden Gates** of all **Great Heavenly Palaces** in the **Ten Directions**.

In **serene stillness**, he responds with **effortless adaptability**;
when he departs or arrives, he is **unconstrained and free**.
Great stillness yet able to conform—
whether departing or arriving, his **marvelous use** unfolds naturally,
achieving **Great Freedom**, never bound or constrained.
His **departures and arrivals**, extensions and flexions,
his **convergence and dispersion**, beginnings and endings—
all such.

Though **united**, he may be **divided**;
his **transformation and adaptation** are **perfect and fluid**, yet **ineffable**.
When **converged**, he may be **distinctly parted**—
his **divine transformations** and **marvelous changes**,
perfectly fluid and vast, lively and unrestrained,
ineffable and beyond measure,
**transformation and adaptation**.

As the **Buddha** said: *"With a mere gesture, he brings forth all"*—
nothing is not the **Dao**.
As the **Confucian** scholars said: *"He encounters sources on both sides."*

He **expounds** the **Dao** of **Pure Liberation**—
he **proclaims** the **True Purity** and **True Emptiness**,
the **Great Awakening** and **Perfect Freedom**.
He **delivers** those mired in **sorrow and suffering**.

**Naturally and spontaneously**, beyond all recognition.
The **Sovereign’s** marvelous transformations unfold naturally—
not within human perception or understanding.

Or, if one takes the **recognition** of what can be recognized as the **will**,
it is not so.
Or, if one takes it as **awakening recognition**,
it is also not so.

With **Great Compassion** and **Great Aspiration**,
**Great Sageliness** and **Great Benevolence**,
he manifests a body of **Pure and Natural Emptiness**—
the **Great Heavenly Sovereign** (Yùhuáng Dàtīanzūn).
This title extols the **Jade Sovereign’s** **holy virtue** in its **absolute purity**.

With **sincere reverence**, he pays homage and recalls:
In past lives, as a **princely heir**,
he endured **suffering** to witness the **profound mysteries** of the **Dao**.

Over **three thousand and more kalpas** of **cultivation and practice**,
it was as though accomplished in a single day.
For **infinite myriads of beings**, he **delivered and saved**,
his compassion extending broadly to the **Ten Directions**.

Though his **Dharma Body** arose from the **embryonic essence** of the **womb and viscera**,
his **Holy Form** emerged from the **transformation** of the **Dao’s source**.
The **Jade Sovereign’s** manifestation—
his **Dharma Body** and **Holy Form**, though born from the **embryonic foundation** of the **womb’s sac** and the **visceral spirit**,
truly are the **marvelous transformations** of the **Great Dao’s** origin.

**Unbroken and unextinguished**, he vanishes yet remains.
He never decays, forever unvanquished.
Vanished as though gone, yet **truly wondrously present**;
vanished as though stored, yet **truly void and ineffable**.

With **Great Compassion** and **Great Aspiration**,
**Great Sageliness** and **Great Benevolence**,
he manifests a **body of unshakable divine clarity**,
the **Supreme True Emptiness Dharma Body**—
the **Great Heavenly Sovereign** (Yùhuáng Dàtīanzūn).
This title extols the **Jade Sovereign’s** **holy fruit** in its **eternal truth**.

**Long kneeling in repentance**—
**long kneeling**, prostrate upon the earth,
with **sincere humility and utmost reverence**.
Or, if one says **long kneeling** refers to **prolonged bending of the knees**,
it is not so.

**Repentance**—
to **confess one’s own faults** and vow to **forever extinguish this evil**.
**Remorse**—
to **regret past transgressions** and vow to **self-reform**,
as when a **culprit surrenders** himself.

From **beginningless kalpas**,
we, your **subjects** (as those who recite the scriptures and are like the virtuous),
have been **covered by ignorance and afflictions**,
obscuring our **True Mind**.
Human nature is inherently **clear**,
yet through **phenomena and emotions**, the mind is stirred,
its own light **veiled and obscured**,
giving rise to **delusive thoughts**—
thus called **ignorance and afflictions**.
From **ignorant thoughts**, the mind is **troubled and restless**,
**hateful and vexed**, losing its **pure heart**—
thus said to **cover the True Mind**.
The **True Mind** remains constant,
though not lost, **ignorance and afflictions** cause it to **darken and be bound**,
as though **covered by things unseen**.

**Now cast off**, our **original truth** is revealed.

We have **habitually committed** the **Three Evil Karmas**—
**habitually**, not just **exclusively** practicing killing, theft, and licentiousness.
Even **killing thoughts**, **theft intentions**, or **licentious desires**
cannot be **utterly severed** in awareness—
thus, we **habitually** engage in evil.

This **body** is the **Three Evil Karmas**.

We **habitually employ** the **Four Evil Tongues**—
**two-faced speech**, spreading strife with **forked tongues**;
or **groundless fabrications**, uttering false words;
or **shriveled, insidious flattery**, decorating speech with **beautiful yet deceitful language**,
**perverting others’ ears** with **empty talk**, not based on truth.

We **slander** the **True and Authentic Great Vehicle Teachings**—
or, not hearing the **Great Dao**, we **erroneously condemn** and **defame**,
**slandering** the **Great Vehicle’s** **orthodox teachings** of **Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism**.

We **quarrel and disrupt**, **alienating kin and friends**—
**quarreling** is not **physical fighting**,
but **inciting false disputes** with **provocative words**,
disrupting **harmony among kin and friends**,
**separating** the **concord of families**.

The **three preceding lines** all describe the **Four Evil Tongues**.

We **indulge** in the **Three Poisons of Greed, Anger, and Delusion**—
or **desire without satisfaction**, greedily seeking without end;
or **resentment and vexation**, ceaseless **anger and hatred**.
Or **mired in delusion**, stubbornly fixated,
**stupid and unchanging**.

The **Three Poisons of Greed, Anger, and Delusion**—
some take the **dark** as a **disease**,
or the **past, present, and future** as the **three minds**—
all are not correct.

「**Praise** and **anger**, **love** and **aversion**, **desire**—these **seven defilements** **foster the Seven Arrogances**.

As **Liu Langran** says:
**Contentment** breeds **joy**; **provocation** breeds **anger**; **fulfillment of wishes** breeds **infatuation**; **contrary intentions** breed **disgust**.
The **three preceding defilements**—**joy**, **anger**, and **infatuation**—when **compounded** with the **four latter ones**, become the **Seven Arrogances**.

The first: **coveting worldly splendor**, not seeking the **Great Dao/Way**, is **Mad Arrogance**.
The second: **indulging in malevolent thoughts**, not believing in **karmic retribution**, is **Reckless Arrogance**.
The third: **lost in illusion and delusion**, not submitting to the **True Dharma**, is **Profane Arrogance**.
The fourth: **delighting in mundane passions**, not associating with the **virtuous**, is **Proud Arrogance**.
The fifth: **concealing resentment and jealousy**, not fearing the **sacred scriptures**, is **Negligent Arrogance**.
The sixth: **yielding to lust and craving**, not safeguarding the **body**, is **Slothful Arrogance**.
The seventh: **unrelenting aversion**, not attaining the **Pure Lands**, not revering the **Divine**, is **Contemptuous Arrogance**.

Some say the **seven emotions**—**joy**, **anger**, **sorrow**, **fear**, **love**, **aversion**, and **desire**—are the **Seven Arrogances**.
But all arise from **joy**, **anger**, **love**, and **aversion**, which **exacerbate the Three Poisons**—**greed**, **anger**, and **delusion**—and thus cannot be **counted among the Seven Arrogances**.
This view is incorrect; **Liu Langran’s** explanation is right. **Examine carefully**, those who study.

The **sinful roots** of **countless past lives** are **difficult to recall**.
The **evil deeds** and **sinful roots** accumulated across **endless kalpas** are **hard to trace or remember**.

The **stains of myriad lives** are **immeasurable**.
The **karmic defilements** of **countless existences**, the **pollutions** of **past lives**, are **beyond reckoning**, their number **unknown**.

**Repentance** to the **Supreme Sage of Boundless Compassion**—
**Sincere return**, **eternal devotion**.
**Relying on** the **Supreme Sage’s** **Great Compassion**, **supporting** the **Divine Benevolence**, in **silent gratitude** I pray for the **permanent eradication** of my **transgressions**.

*Compassion* may also be read as *Reverence*, but that is **too constrained**.

**Unveiling** the **True Mind**, **extending** **repentance**.
**Unveiling** the **authentic benevolent heart**, **humbling** myself in **sincere repentance** and **remorse**.

**All sins** of **ten thousand kalpas** and **myriad lives**—
**Ten thousand kalpas**, **myriad lives**—briefly enumerated to speak of **all past sins** and **defilements**.
I **pray** that through **repentance**, they **all be purged**.

**Offering** this **body and mind** to the **Supreme True One**—
**Offering** this **perceived form** and **mind** **eternally** to the **True Sage**, **solely devoting** to the **Supreme True One**.
I **solemnly pray** that **all sinful roots** be **fully forgiven**.
I **solemnly pray** that **all past sinful roots** be **granted absolution** without **knowledge or intent**.

With **utter sincerity**, I **take this vow**—
I **pray** that my **eyes** may **always behold** the **Jade Millipede’s** **radiant form**,
That my **ears** may **always hear** the **sacred teachings**,
That my **nose** may **always inhale** the **fragrance of all sublime perfumes**,
That my **tongue** may **always extol** the **Supreme Dao/Way**,
That my **body** may **never be defiled** by **licentious impurities**,
That my **mind** may **always retain** the **True Faith**.

I **vow** to **repay** the **Fourfold Debt of Gratitude**—
**Heaven and Earth**, **sustaining life**; **Sun and Moon**, **illuminating all**; **Kings and Lands**, **protecting existence**; **Parents**, **giving birth**.
I **vow** to **relieve** the **Threefold Sufferings** of **samsara**—
**Sufferings of form**, **birth and death**; **sufferings of sense**, **earthly afflictions**; **sufferings of mind**, **torment of the spirit**.
I **vow** to **broadly extend** **compassion** and **pity** for **all beings**,
Or, as some say, to **broadly extend** the **Emperor’s compassion**.
I **vow** to **widespreadly practice** **skillful means** to **liberate all sentient beings**.

**Supreme Jade Emperor’s Original Scripture Collection**
**Volume One**

**Divine Prowess of the Celestial Palace of Qingwei (First Section)**

The **Ancestral Celestial Master** says:
The **Celestial Palace of Qingwei** transcends the Three Realms, purifying all defilements, its void and mystery luminous and wondrous, subtle beyond measure. Dwelling within the Three Pure Realms, it is the Great Celestial Palace, where the Jade Emperor resides. The **Primordial Origin** expounded this scripture here, governing this wondrous realm with supreme and mysterious efficacy, its transformations boundless and unfathomable. This scripture expounds its essence as the **highest section**; only divine insight and profound wisdom can comprehend it—hence, it is called **"Divine Prowess (First Section)."**

**Scholar’s Note:** Ancient texts define *divine* as "mysterious transformations beyond measure," and *prowess* as "pervasive without omission." It is the crown of the Five Sections and the essence of the Three Pure Realms. The **Dan Platform** aligns with this—once understood, the entire scripture becomes clear.

**Divine Prowess (First Chapter)**

At that time, the **Primordial Origin Celestial Venerable**—
*"At that time"* refers to the initial manifestation of the **Boundless Mirror**, the commencement of **Great Mystery’s** transformation, the auspicious confluence of all saints, the moment this scripture was to be expounded.

*Yuan* (元) means **great**, **first**; *Shǐ* (始) means **origin**. The enlightenment of all saints began with the **Primordial Origin**.

Thus, it is called the **Primordial Origin Celestial Venerable**.

**Within the Celestial Realm of Qingwei**—
*(Explanation of Qingwei Heaven provided earlier.)*

**Divine Prowess (First Chapter continued)**

**The Celestial Capital of Jade and the Golden Gate**
The **Celestial Sovereign of Purple Clarity and White Purity** spoke:
*"The abode of the Jade Emperor is built of white jade as its capital (京) and yellow gold as its gate (阙), not the mundane gold and jade of mortal realms, but divine manifestations of wondrous transformation—azure heavens resplendent with celestial splendor, adorning the sacred precincts of the court. Hence, it is called the **Celestial Capital of Jade and the Golden Gate**.*

**The Seven-Treasured Mystic Gardens**
The **Celestial Sovereign of White Purity** spoke:
*The Seven Treasures are: jade of emerald hue, stages of luminous jade, palaces of lapis lazuli, walls inscribed with dragon motifs, white jade citadels, vermilion gates, and golden radiance that pierces all darkness. Another account names them: glass, crystal, pearls, agate, coral, amber, and conch shells. The **Mystic Gardens** are the secret precincts of the **Double Mystery**.*

**The Jade Emperor’s Palace and Ascended Seat of Radiance**
**Zhang Liang** spoke:
*"In the Primordial Origin epoch, the Celestial Venerable ascended to preside over the Jade Emperor’s Palace, ascending the **Great Seat of Radiant Clarity and Mystic Sovereignty**.*

**With the countless assemblies of the Boundless**
He expounded the **Sacred Treasure of Pure and Undivided Oneness**."

**Zhang Liang** spoke:
*"When the Primordial Origin ascended the seat, the boundless true saints gathered in assembly. Thus, it is said: ‘With the countless assemblies of the Boundless,’ proclaiming the **Mystic Treasure of Divine Clarity**, pure and unstained, the supreme secret of **True Oneness**, unobstructed and unmixed, the **Undivided Law-Gate**."*

**The Ten Directions’ Gathering Explanation**
*"The human **Primordial Spirit** is the essence of life and destiny. The Great Celestial Venerable, within the Qingwei Heavenly Realm, inherently possesses this. The **Celestial Capital of Jade and the Golden Gate**, adorned with the Seven Treasures, is inherently possessed by all. The human body’s **yin-yang vital essence, spirit-qi, and refined essence** are the Seven Treasures of the self. Thus, the **Lingting Mystic Gardens** harmonize heaven and humanity.*

*When the Heavenly Sovereign is serene and composed, the **Seat of Radiant Clarity** may be ascended, and all limbs obey in unison. Concentrating the spirit and aligning with the Dao, one becomes the Celestial Venerable’s seat, joining the Boundless assemblies in proclaiming the **Sacred Treasure of Pure and Undivided Oneness**.*

*Yet the Dao has no fixed form—when one awakens with clarity, one attains the secret realm of subtlety, as straightforward as a great road. To enter it is natural.*

*Hence, it is called the **Law-Gate**."*

---
**Divine Prowess (Second Chapter)**

**At that time**—
*The moment when the Primordial Origin ascended the seat.*

**The Celestial Sovereign Emperor**
*"Emperor"* denotes unparalleled exaltation, hence the appellation.

**With the Celestial True Ones, the Flying Heavenly Great Saints, the Boundless Divine Kings, the Spirit Boys and Jade Girls—nine hundred million in number—observing strict purity and bearing sacred banners, standing in attendance.**

**Zhang Liang** spoke:
*"‘With’ means ‘together.’ ‘All’ refers to the multitude. The Jade Emperor, in concert with the celestial immortals and divine true ones, ascended in divine transformation and wondrous prowess. The **Flying Heavenly Great Saints**, the **Three Thousand Great Realms**, and the countless gods of the Boundless—those of the heavenly and earthly planes—along with the **Minor Yang Divine Qi** that responds to invocation, the **Spirit Boys** who attend with reverence, and the **Minor Yin Divine Qi** that transmits decrees, the **Jade Girls** who proclaim transformations—totaling nine hundred million divine beings.*

*Without revealing their divine radiance, they returned to the Primordial Origin’s essence, observing strict purity and holding sacred banners, standing beside the Primordial Origin’s Seat of Radiance."*

**The Heavenly Marshal Tian You** spoke:
*"Within the human body, there is the **True Sovereign, the Primordial Spirit**, unrestrained in its divine communication. There are also the **Flying Heavenly Great Saints**, whose spirit-qi guards the body. Even in the smallest interstices, there are the **Boundless Divine Kings**, the **Minor Yang’s Mystic Light**, the **Minor Yin’s Divine Motion**, and the **Spirit Boys and Jade Girls**. When the heart aligns with the Dao, the **Nine Hundred Million**—the great numbers of yang vigor—are also present, and the body’s spirits pay homage to the Primordial.*

*‘Observing strict purity’ means the mind is undivided; ‘holding sacred banners’ means the body is without sluggishness."*

**Master Guan’s Perspective** spoke:
*"Humans are akin to heaven and earth—when clear and unadulterated, the **Primordial Spirit** ascends to the pole. Indeed, it is like **Yan Hui’s heart-fasting** or the **legalist’s bearing of the banner**, singing in reverence without division, thus obeying the Heavenly Sovereign and attaining the Dao."*

**Divine Prowess (Third Chapter)**

**Thereupon,**

**Divine Prowess (Third Chapter)**

At this auspicious gathering,
The Jade Sovereign, knowing the hour was near, displayed the **Six Perfections** before the assembly, emitting a vast radiant light that illuminated all the **Primordial Dream Palaces** of the boundless heavens. Every realm trembled in response, and the ten directions of the infinite worlds became as transparent as **crystal and glass**, with no obstruction whatsoever.

**Master Zhuang** remarked:
*"The Jade Sovereign, aware that the time for the **Mystic Light’s** revelation had arrived and that the moment to propagate the **Law** and transmit the **Scriptures** was at hand, thus manifested the **Six Perfections** before the grand assembly. He emitted the most universal and luminous light, illuminating the boundless heavens, the **Dream Palaces** of all the celestial deities and divine spirits, and every sacred realm they inhabited. All were shaken and awestruck. The infinite worlds of all the **Sages and Buddhas** in the ten directions became as clear as **crystal and glass**, their light penetrating and revealing all without hindrance or concealment."*

**Master Zhang Wuzhang** explained:
*"The **Six Perfections**—**Vision-Perfection**, **Hearing-Perfection**, **Mind-Touch-Perfection**, **Mind-Meeting-Perfection**, **Foresight-Perfection**, and **Pre-illumination-Perfection**—are what the Buddhist tradition calls the **Six Divine Eyes** and such."*

**Master Zhuang** further clarified:
*"**Dream Palaces** are the abodes of the celestial emperors and deities—marvelous and resplendent in the heavens, not tainted by dust, never decaying, and unshakably firm. The mortal eye cannot perceive them, hence the term **Dream Palace**."*

*"Every sacred realm is the domain where the deities reside. These realms encompass all worlds—not merely human domains, but also celestial realms, which are also called **worlds**."*

*"Though **crystal** has form and light, it reveals all that it bears; **glass**, though flawless, leaves nothing unseen. The Jade Sovereign’s light penetrates all realms, illuminating even the most hidden—how could there be any obstruction? The comparison is made to help those who might not grasp the meaning directly."*

**Master Guan** observed:
*"Human nature is inherently luminous, yet when the **Primordial Spirit** strays from its master, obstructions arise. Sometimes one hears without seeing, sees without hearing, knows without speaking, or speaks without knowing. Sometimes one’s perception is clouded between self and others, or confused between past and present—this is the failure of the **Six Perfections**."*

*"If one penetrates the **Nature and Command**, and the **Primordial Spirit** governs its rightful place, then one’s illumination will encompass both heaven and humanity, revealing all within and without. The **Jade Reservoir**, the **Dan Platform**, the **Yellow Court**, and the **Mystic Domain**—these are the original sites of the body’s spirits, where the **Celestial Enclosure** naturally shines. All is illuminated without hindrance, just as **crystal and glass** reveal all without concealment."*

*"Indeed, the **Way** is inherently luminous, yet clarity is not easily attained. One must not be deceived by what is not yet known, nor confused by what is already known. Neither too early nor too late—true awakening is most difficult. If one can emulate the Jade Sovereign, observing the opportune moment to manifest light and renewing it daily without ceasing, then the **Great Illumination** will never dim, and the **Way** will endure."*

**Divine Prowess (Fourth Chapter)**

The **Sages of the Ten Directions**, riding upon **Five-Colored Jewel Wheels**, **Lingyu Spotted Jade Chariots**, **Nine-Colored Mystic Dragons**, and **Ten-Sublime Feathered Canopies**, arrived in procession.

**Master Lei Zu** noted:
*"The **Ten Directions** encompass the four cardinal points, the four diagonal corners, and the realms above and below. The **Sages** are the divine and holy assemblies of the ten directions."*

*"Witnessing the Jade Sovereign’s radiant light, they ascended their **Five-Colored** jewel-wheeled carriages, **Lingyu** jade chariots, **spotted emerald** banners, **Nine-Colored** mystic dragons, and **Ten-Sublime** feathered canopies."*

**Master Bai Yutian** elaborated:
*"The **Five Colors** are **blue, yellow, red, white, and black**. **Wheels** are the dual wheels of a chariot. **Chariot** refers to the vehicle itself. **Banner** is the collective term for imperial processional standards. The **Nine Colors** are **blue, red, yellow, white, black, purple, green, the Supreme Mystic hue, and the Golden-Luminous hue**. The **Mystic Dragon** bears the dragon’s form and light but no corporeal frame. **Ten-Sublime** means surpassing all extremes—divine and wondrous, like the feathered canopies of auspicious phoenixes and cranes."*

*"The **Scriptures** state: **Feathered Canopy** refers to a high-stemmed feathered fan. Another account says that when the divine and holy emperors travel, they bear **auspicious feathered standards** as their canopy. The latter explanation is more profound."*

**Master Guan** reflected:
*"Humans, endowed with the **Primordial Spirits** of the **Five Phases**—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—each possess their own **treasures**. When the **Dao** is perfected, these treasures attend the **Law-Vehicle**. If one can silently pay homage to the **Heavenly Sovereign**, imitating the celestial order, then within one’s body, the spirits gather, and the **Rectified Qi** manifests in splendor. The **Jewel Wheels**, the **Lingyu True Chariots**, the **Emerald Banners**, the **Nine-Qi Mystic-Transformed Dragons**, and the **Ten-Sublime Unmatched Feathered Canopies**—these were all within one’s own person. Why should they belong only to the celestial and divine?"*

*"Alas, only the truly enlightened understand this."*

**Divine Prowess (Fifth Chapter)**

With **Qilin dancing** and **phoenixes singing**, their **harmonious hymns** resounded—**Divine Consorts** scattering **jewel blossoms**, **Golden Boys** wafting **auspicious mists**, reciting **profound hymns** as they floated through the void.

**Master Xu Qing Tian Shi** described:
*"As the **Sages** proceeded, the **Qilin** led in dance, and the **Auspicious Phoenix** harmonized in song, their melodious cries blending in perfect rhythm. The **Celestial Consorts** scattered **jewel flowers**, while the attending **Golden Boys** emitted **auspicious mists**. They chanted **profound hymns**, guarding the divine procession as they floated through the empty heavens toward the **Imperial Capital**."*

**The Ten-Direction Assembly** remarked:
*"When the divine emperors journey, **Spirit Boys** and **Flower-Gathering Maidens** sing in attendance, while the **Qilin** dances and the **Phoenix** sings, imitating the **Qilin’s** and **Phoenix’s** movements. Hence, it is said: *‘Their hymns resound in harmony.*’ This interpretation is overly forced."*

*"The divine procession includes **Qilin** and **Phoenixes**, akin to the **celestial steeds** that accompany the Emperor today. Moreover, the **Scriptures** state: *‘When the Heavenly Emperor travels, dragons soar and phoenixes dance.’* This reflects the **Supreme Harmony** of the celestial scene."*

*"It is also said: *‘Dragons and leopards long howl in the mountains and forests,’*—this is the **harmonious hymn** of the true **Qilin** and **Phoenix**. Otherwise, why would the **Sage Emperor Shun** compose music on **Qishan Mountain**, summoning the **Phoenix’s** rites and causing all beasts to dance?"*

*"Examining the **Scriptures** with this in mind, the earlier explanation is correct."*

「My humble view holds: When a person cultivates the Dao, silently aligning with the Imperial Will, honoring the Primordial Sovereign, the body embodies **Supreme Harmony**. The **Heavenly Resonance** sings in response, the **Mysterious Veins** settle in ease, and the demeanor is as refined as the **Qilin’s** dance or the **Luan-Feng’s** song—**séng-séng**, a joy to behold.

The **Yang Essence** radiates in splendor, the **Yin Luster** reveals itself in bloom, as though the **Divine Consorts** scatter flowers and the **Golden Boys** waft incense. The **Secret Music** and **Mysterious Melodies** are the **Heavenly-Human Praises**, the **Piercing Chapters**, resonating with the **Primordial Spirit**. It is as if one rides the void on the wind—this too is the **Holy Assembly** ascending in midair to the Imperial Gate.

This is the shared essence of all, yet only those of resolve may verify it.

**Chapter on Divine Penetration (Section 1):**
At this time, the **Brahman-Heavens**, all **Golden Immortals**, **Great Vehicle Bodhisattvas**, the **Fourfold Hosts**, and the **Eight Divisions**—bathed in this radiance—ascend upon **golden, jade, and flying-cloud palanquins**, their **Nine Haloed Auras** scattering wondrous brilliance. They gather in **Celestial Celebration**, the **Three Celestial Lights** exhaling fragrance, **Eightfold Harmonies** swirling in incense, circling the Dao’s path. A shower of **Wondrous Flowers** descends like clouds, covering the assembly before them.

**Zi Fang** expounds: At this time, all **Brahman-Heavens**, the **Enlightened Golden Immortals**, the **Great Awakened Ones** who have grasped the **True Great Vehicle Path**, the **Fourfold Hosts** of **celestial generals, male and female deities**, and the **Eight Divisions of Heavenly Beings**—bathed in this luminous glow—ascend upon **golden-hued, jade-carved palanquins borne by flying clouds**, adorned in **Nine-Haloed Robes**, their **Mysterious Scenery** effulgent. They celebrate the **Auspicious Sky**, the **Fourfold Gatherings**—the **Celestial Assembly of Merit**, the **Divine Assembly of Felicity**, the **Assembly of Timely Convergence**, and the **Assembly of Fated Alignment**—not solely the gathering of the **Fourfold Hosts**. The **Eightfold Harmonies** swirl around the Dao’s path, the **Holy Assembly** circling in reverence, and the **Wondrous Flowers**, like clouds descending, entirely cover the grand assembly. Or it may be said that the **Holy Hosts descend like clouds**, though this is overly forced.

**Ma Gu** elucidates:
- **Brahman-Heavens**: The **Supreme Precious Forest**, the **Jade Palaces** unseen in the mundane world, their hidden mysteries unfathomable. Hence, they are called **Brahman-Heavens**.
- **Golden Immortals**: Immortals of **Unbreakable Gold**.
- **Great Vehicle Bodhisattvas**: Such as **Guanyin the Great Sage** and others.
- **Fourfold Hosts**: **Immortal Hosts**, **General Hosts**, **Male Deities**, and **Female Deities**. Or it may include **Celestial Deities and Demons**, all encompassing. It does not refer to **secular monks and nuns**. For mortal bodies cannot easily ascend to the heavens, hence these four are not mentioned.
- **Eight Divisions**:
  - **Divine Division** (神部),
  - **General Division** (将部),
  - **Celestial Human and Heavenly Laborers Division** (天人天丁部),
  - **Vajra Division** (金刚部),
  - **Dragon King Division** (龙王部),
  - **Night-Light Female Attendants Division** (夜光女使部),
  - **Asura Division** (修罗部),
  - **Rākṣasa Division** (夜叉部).

- **Nine Haloes**: **Emerald Halo**, **Rainbow Halo**, **Purple Halo**, **Crimson Halo**, **Cloud Halo**, **Mist Halo**, **Auspicious Light Halo**, **Luminous Splendor Halo**, and **Universal Treasure Halo**. The **Nine-Colored Mysterious Light** flows with this wondrous scene—this is the radiance of their **Divine Robes**, though it may also signify the **Mysterious Comeliness** of their forms, not solely the garments they wear.
- **Celestial Celebration**: A **Joyous Day**, or the **Celebration of the Divine Sky**.
- **Fourfold Gatherings**: The **Assembly of Celestial Merit**, the **Assembly of Divine Felicity**, the **Assembly of Timely Convergence**, and the **Assembly of Fated Alignment**. Not solely the gathering of the **Fourfold Hosts**.
- **Circling the Dao’s path**: The **Eightfold Harmonies** swirling in reverence, or the **Holy Assembly** circling in reverence.
- **Like clouds descending, covering the assembly**: The **Wondrous Flowers** descending like clouds entirely cover the assembly. Or it may be said that the **Holy Hosts descend like clouds**, though this is overly forced.

My humble view holds: The **Spirits of the Human Body** are manifold. If the **Primordial Spirit** does not govern them, the myriad spirits will not manifest their **Numinous Virtue**. Only those who cultivate the **True Way**, silently paying homage to the **True Lord**, will see the **Ten Thousand Spirits** in reverent attendance. The **Mysterious Treasury’s Light** reveals its **Hundred Wonders**, each converging in display. When the **Primordial Spirit** gathers at the fore, all **Auspicious Omens** align, like **Auspicious Clouds** covering all—then I and the heavens are as one, undivided.

**Chapter on Divine Penetration (Section 2):**
At this time, the **Imperial Light** illuminates all the **Heavens**, descending to illuminate the **Ten Directions’ Boundless Worlds**, aligning with the **Playful Metropolis** realm. All mortal realms, even those near the **Nine Heavens**, are connected and intimately linked. Even the **Boundless Worlds below**, their **mountains, ridges, valleys, and ravines**, stretch flat as the palm—**Six Directions** are near, the **Three Realms** not distant.

The **Celestial Treasures’ Pavilions and Halls** dot the mortal realm like stars, **Precious Jade and Rare Gems** arrayed in splendor along the clouded paths. **Seven-Treasured Railings** mark the boundaries, **Jade Trees and Immortal Flowers** gleam with **Jewel-Like Luster**, their **Mysterious Splendor** radiating from the **Elixir Fields**, while **Lingzhi mushrooms and sacred grasses** spread in lush coverage.

**The True Person of Heaven** declares: At this time, the **Jade Emperor’s Light** shines upon the **Thirty-Six Heavens of this world** and the **Three Thousand Great Realms of the Heavens**, descending to illuminate all the **Boundless Worlds of the Ten Directions**, all rendered luminous, identical to the **Playful Metropolis** where the Jade Emperor resides. All mortal realms within these **Dharma Realms**, bathed in this light, face no obstruction—even those near the **Nine Solar Transformations of Heaven**. The **Heavens, Earth, and Mortal Realms** are interconnected, intimately linked. Even the **Boundless Worlds below**, with their towering mountains, jagged ridges, murky valleys, and ravines, stretch flat as the palm. The **Six Directions** are intimately connected, the **Three Pure Realms** not distant.

The **Heavenly Treasures’ Pavilions and Halls** appear in the mortal realm like stars, **Precious Jade and Rare Gems** arranged in splendor along the clouded thoroughfares. **Seven-Treasured Railings** demarcate the paths, **Jade-Branched Treasure Trees** and **Immortal Wondrous Flowers** gleam with **Jewel-Like Luster**, their **Mysterious Splendor** radiating from the **Elixir Fields**, while **Lingzhi mushrooms and sacred grasses** spread in lush, continuous coverage.

**Shi Xing’s Annotation on *Lin Kao*:** The **Human Sovereign’s** dwelling is called the **Capital**. The **Jade Emperor’s** abode surpasses all heavens, unseen by the world, hence **Playful Metropolis**. Normally, the **Heavens are clear and the Earth is murky**, the **Divine and the Mortal** disconnected—this is not intimacy. But when the **Imperial Light** shines through, the **Divine Mechanisms** link in wonder, and thus the **Heavens and Mortals** connect, growing intimate.

**Nine Heavens**: The **Nine Upper Realms of the Thirty-Six Heavens**, not merely nine.

The mountains rise high and grand—thus they are called mountains.
**Ling** are great hills, **mounds** the vast mounds.
**Pō** refers to uneven land, **bǎn** the jagged ridges of mountains.
Deep and long is called a **gully**.
Mountains flanking water are **ravines**.
Where water flows is a **stream**.
A great void in the mountain is a **valley**.
**Miǎn** means level and flat.
The earth, with its mountains, waters, valleys, and ravines, is inherently uneven.
Yet when the **Imperial Light** covers and illuminates, its wondrous intent permeates, making all worlds’ lands level.

**Qióng** is fine stone; **guī** refers to jade-like gems.
When they cluster in profusion, they are called **arrayed**.
**Yúnqú** are the celestial pathways at the heavens’ summit.
Horizontal barriers are called **rails**; vertical ones, **screens**—just as the world’s defenses are arranged.
**Chén** is the radiant brilliance of flowers.
**Zhūbǎo** are true pearls and gems.
**Dāntián** is the **Elixir Field**, the sacred **Dan Platform** of the **Playful Metropolis**.

**Shi Xing’s Annotation:** The human body contains **Heaven and Earth**; the **Yin and Yang** essence remains ununited, so the upper and lower are distant and estranged. But when the **Primordial Spirit** commands the **Light**, the **Heavenly Radiance** blazes forth, and **Earth-Heaven harmony** prevails, the high and low bend in accord, all drawing near in wondrous unity. The treasures inherent in the body, revealed in divine splendor, differ not from those above. The **Elixir Field**, where the **Spirit** resides, displays marvelous scenes—sacred grasses and **Lingzhi** flourish in lush abundance, while **Jewel-Like Flowers** bloom without need for distant seeking.

**Chapter on Divine Transformation:**
At that time, all in the lower realms see the **Heavenly Strings’** wondrous music from the **Pinjiao Heavens**, revolving with the **Imperial Light**, naturally resounding in harmony. They also see **Luan cranes** singing, **Ling phoenixes** harmonizing, their cries rising in rhythmic response; **Xuan dragons** dance, **Ling unicorns** coil, soaring and circling at the celestial summit. The **Heavenly Treasure Flowers** scatter and drift, filling every path.

Then, both **commoners and sages** are astonished, the hidden and dark illuminated. **Heavenly beings and mortals** rejoice and leap in delight. Even the unenlightened and **Dao-seekers** ascend, gazing upward at the **Effulgent Jewel Platforms** of countless **kalpas**, downward at the **Purple Clouds** veiling the **Mile-Cloth Boundaries**. All beings in these worlds attain **Dao-qi transformation**—the aged with wrinkled faces rejuvenate, their hair turning **deep indigo**, their complexions **crimson**. The young and vigorous, the infants, grow ever more radiant, their forms luminous and flawless. All sufferings vanish, all are liberated, serene and joyous. Across the land, songs of praise celebrate the **Great Peace**.

The **Emperor of Eternal Life** declared:
When the **Imperial Light** shines universally, all beneath the heavens see the **Heavenly Strings’** secret melodies from the **Pinjiao Heavens**, revolving with the **Imperial Light**, their sounds naturally resonant. They also see **Luan cranes** singing, **Ling phoenixes** harmonizing, their movements rhythmic and precise; **Xuan dragons** dance, **Ling unicorns** spiral, soaring and circling at the celestial summit. The **Heavenly Treasure Flowers** scatter and drift, filling every path.

At this moment, both **commoners and sages** are astonished, the hidden and dark illuminated. **Heavenly beings and mortals** rejoice and leap in delight. Even the unenlightened and **Dao-seekers** ascend, gazing upward at the **Effulgent Jewel Platforms** of countless **kalpas**, downward at the **Purple Clouds** veiling the **Mile-Cloth Boundaries**. All beings in these worlds attain **Dao-qi transformation**—the aged with wrinkled faces rejuvenate, their hair turning **deep indigo**, their complexions **crimson**. The young and vigorous, the infants, grow ever more radiant, their forms luminous and flawless. All sufferings vanish; the **Three Thousand Great Realms**, old and young alike, are all liberated, serene, and joyous. Across the land, songs of praise celebrate the **Great Peace**.

**Lei Men’s Envoy** said:
The **Heavenly Strings’** music is **gold**, the first of the **Eight Sounds**. Its **Dharma-tones** are **primordial gold**, uncorrupted. All harmonies blend without discord, the essence of **sound and rhythm**. Some say it is **naturally attuned**, a sound the world rarely hears—thus, **Pinjiao**. Others say the **Great Constructor** wields the **Great Balance**, and **Dao-transformation** flows naturally in **Great Harmony**; the **Heavenly Music’s** marvel is the **Great Constructor’s** work—hence, **Pinjiao**.

**Yǒngyuè huānxīn**—to leap and dance in joy, hands and feet moving in delight.
**Rèn** means **eight chi** (a measure of height).
The **Heavenly Jewel Platforms** endure through countless **kalpas**, unwearable—thus, **Effulgent Kalpa-Platforms**.
**Yǎnguān** is to lift one’s gaze; **fǔmiǎn** to lower one’s head and look.
**Zǐyún míluó**—the **Yellow-Lao Treasure Realm**—not merely what is seen beneath the **Jewel Platforms**, but also the **comprehensive vision** of ascent and descent.

**Gàn** is a deep **indigo** tinged with **crimson**; **gànfà** is what is now called **green temples**.

**Shi Xing’s Annotation:** The human body holds **Yin and Yang**; the **upper qi** is pure, the **lower qi** turbid. If the **qi** is stagnant and unharmonized, the **upper** remains unseen and unheard, leading to decay, weakness, and exhaustion—thus, the breath fades.

But when one aligns with the **Great Dao**, the **Primordial Secret** is revealed, the **Luminous Marvel** shines, and the **True Sounds** and **True Transformations** are heard and seen. The **Pinjiao melodies**, the **Ling phoenixes and cranes**, the **Xuan dragons and unicorns**—all display their wonders. **Jewel Flowers** drift in splendor, filling the world with beauty. The **Yin and Yang qi** harmonize in perfection, the **Spirit** astonished. All darkness merges into light, the upper and lower in perfect accord—thus, the **Heavenly beings and mortals** leap and dance in joy.

The **Yin** dissipates and returns; the **wondrous intent** ascends to the **Mystic**. Thus, even the **commoners and Dao-seekers** all ascend. Gazing upward at the **Jade Jewel Platforms**, downward at the **Boundless Mystic Realm**, the land is rich, the people at peace, the **qi** harmonized, the **Spirit** serene. The weak grow strong, the stagnant flow freely; the deficient become abundant. **Tendons and marrow** are transformed, **Great Harmony** preserved. The body thrives in perfect balance, rejoicing in this **wondrous transformation**.

The aged return to youth, the young grow ever more radiant—
the world sings in joy of the **Heavenly Emperor’s** virtue and **Great Harmony**!

Ah, this is the true **dharma**! The enlightened taste its sweetness.

At that time, the **Divine Perfections** manifest in nine chapters:
the **Mystic Wind** billows far and wide,
the **Ten Thousand Qi** (*wànqì*) surge with **Heavenly Grace**,
**Heaven trembles** and the earth **splits**—
**dry bones reanimate**, drowned corpses rise with **flying souls**,
all regaining their forms.

The **Yin** realm of **Yùdū** (*酆都*), encircled by iron walls,
its endless night of **Nine Abysses** (*jiǔyōu*)—
at that moment, all is shattered.
**Suffering souls** of the **Hell Realms** (*dìyù*) are reborn in **Pure Lands** (*zhūtian*).
The torments of **Three Evil Paths** (*sān’è dào*)—
**Hell, Hungry Ghosts** (*èguǐ*), and **Animal Realm** (*chùshēng*)—
are all dissolved.

Then, the countless guilty,
by this **radiant virtue** and **Dao-light** (*dàoguāng*),
are born anew in the **Ten Directions’ Great Celestial Palaces**.

**Wei Boyang** says:
When the world rejoices in **Great Harmony**,
the **Heavenly Emperor’s** virtue and **Mystic Wind** billow far,
the **Wondrous Qi** (*miàohuà wànqì*) surges,
and **Heavenly Grace** spreads.

**Heaven’s** **Yang** vitality flourishes, vigorous and robust—
**Heaven trembles** in its **Mystic Vehicle** (*xiányú*).
**Earth’s** **Yin** opens to **Great Destiny** (*chéngyùn*), gentle and yielding—
**Earth splits** in its **Soulful Depths** (*língyōu*).

**Dried bones** return to life, not merely **revived** (*jiǎgǔ zàiqǐ*),
and **drowned corpses** (*chénshī*)—
those whose **souls** have fled and **forms** decayed—
awaken to **Dao**, knowing the **True**, and **Yang** renews their bones.
Among mortals, these are the **Immortal Ones** (*rénzhōng zhī xiān*), whose bones regrow.

The **soul** (*pò*) in the living body
delights in death, feasting on sacrifices,
yet if one does not **realize the Dao** (*bù míngdào*),
**earthly attachments** (*chénshí*) bind them,
**Spirit** departs with the body, **souls** vanish and **soul-essence** (*pòjīng*) scatters.
Some cling to their own illusions,
others fall into **karmic prisons** (*yuànyù*).
When **soul-essence** rises and **fantasies** dissolve,
evil **karmic residues** (*èniè*) flee with the **soul**.

Yet the **Yin** realm of **Yùdū** (*tiěwéi Yùdū*), its iron walls unyielding,
all is broken by the **Heavenly Emperor’s** **Mystic Light** (*yùdū zhēnguāng*).
Where no **Heavenly Light** penetrates,
in the endless night of **Nine Abysses** (*jiǔyōu hēiyù*),
all is rent asunder by radiance.
The **Yin** realm’s iron walls collapse instantly—
**suffering souls** ascend to **Heaven**,
the torments of the **Three Evil Paths** dissolved.

Then, the guilty who receive this **radiant virtue**,
leaning on this **Dao-power** (*dàoli*),
are born anew in the **Ten Directions’ Great Celestial Palaces**.

For mortals in this world,
this is a treasure to ponder.

The **Divine Perfections** unfold in ten chapters:
At that time, the **Heavenly Emperor** divides His **Body of Law** (*fǎshēn*),
pervading all the **Great Celestial Palaces** (*dàtian gōng*).
Each palace naturally manifests—
**white jade** as the capital (*jīng*),
**gold** as the gates (*què*),
the **Seven Treasures’ Mystic Gardens** (*qībǎo xuányuàn*) resplendent with the **Great Light Hall** (*dàguāngmíng diàn*), its **radiant seat** (*guāngmíng zuò*) gleaming.
**Banners and flags** (*chuángjié fānshǎng*) unfurl,
**rare treasures and marvelous flowers** adorn every place.

Then, the **Heavenly Emperor** with His divided **Body of Law**,
throughout these realms—
in the **white jade capital** (*báiyù jīngzhōng*),
within the **golden gates** (*huángjīn quètíng*),
upon the **Seven Treasures’ Mystic Gardens** (*qībǎo zhuāngyán xuányuàn*),
all as He abides—
universally proclaims the **path of purity and liberation**.

**Zhōnglí Shìjūn** (*钟离帝君*) says:
When the **Great Light** is unleashed,
the **Heavenly Emperor** divides and manifests His **Body of Law**,
reaching all the **Great Celestial Palaces**.
Each palace naturally reveals itself—
**white jade capital**, **golden gates**,
the **Seven Treasures’** adorned **Mystic Gardens** (*qībǎo zhuāngyán xuányuàn*),
all as the **Heavenly Emperor’s** own dwelling.

The **Great Light’s Mystic Hall** (*Dàguāngmíng Xuándiàn*), fully adorned with the **Great Light’s Treasure Seat** (*Dàguāngmíng bǎozuò*), wields the **Mystic Law Banner** (*Xuánhuī fǎchuāng*), its **auspicious canopy** (*jiéyān huágài*) and **divine pavilions** (*fánshì*) unfurled—
with **exquisite celestial treasures** and **marvelous heavenly flowers**,
pervading all the **Great Celestial Palaces** (*Zhōngdà Tiānyōng*).

At that time, the **Heavenly Emperor** manifests His **wondrously divided Body of Law** (*miàofèn zhī shēn*), abiding throughout all the **Great Celestial Palaces**.
His **divine transformation** (*shénhuà*) fills the **White Jade Capital** (*Yùjīng*), the **Golden Gates** (*Jīnquè*), and the **Seven Treasures’ Mystic Gardens** (*Qībǎo Xuányuàn*).
He ascends the **Great Light’s Hall** (*Dàguāngmíng Diàn*) and takes His place upon the **Treasure Seat of Light** (*Guāngmíng Zuò*).
All the **celestial deities** (*zhūshén*) seated there are radiant with **divine light**.

The **Primordial Beginning Heavenly Emperor** (*Yuànshǐ Yùdì*) manifests the **Treasure Seat of Law** (*Fǎbǎo Zuò*).
Its light is most wondrous, boundless in grandeur,
ineffable in divinity, surpassing all measure—
exceeding even the **Buddhist Law King’s Seat** (*Fójiā fǎwáng zuò*).
Therefore, the **Heavenly Emperor**, in His **divinized Body of Law** (*huàshēn*), ascends this seat
to universally proclaim across the **Ten Directions** (*shífāng*)
the **true pure** (*zhēnqīng*) and **true clean** (*zhēnqìng*) **path of awakening and transcendence** (*wùjiě chāotuō zhī dào*).

**Manifestation** (*yǎn*)—
**manifestation and illumination** (*yǎnmíng*), **setting forth its meaning** (*chén qí yì*).

**Limited Perspective** (*Guǎnjiàn*) says:
The **Primordial Spirit** (*yuánshén*) of humankind—
**spiritually penetrating**, unrestrained,
reaching everywhere without hindrance—
is fundamentally akin to the **Heavenly Emperor’s wondrous transformation** (*miàohuà*).
The **Purple Treasury** (*Zǐfǔ*) and **Elixir Platform** (*Dāntái*)—
are fundamentally the same as the **celestial halls of the deities** (*shén gōng*).
The **Auspicious Reishi** (*Ruìzhī*) and **Numinous Medicines** (*Língyào*)—
are fundamentally the same as the **heavenly marvelous flowers** (*tiānshàng qíhuā*).

Yet, humans are ensnared by worldly gains (*shìlì*),
their **Primordial Spirit** (*yuánshén*) losing its master (*shǐzhǔ*).
Thus, they cannot **circulate freely and penetrate thoroughly** (*zhōuliú chègòu*),
**manifesting numinous power wherever they touch** (*chùchù chénglíng*).
They forfeit their **true purity and tranquility** (*qīngjìng zhēn*), unable to attain the **path of liberation** (*jiětuō zhī dào*).

If one **preserves the True** (*bǎozhēn hé dào*) and **reverently honors the Divine Sovereign** (*mòlǐ shénwáng*),
then **spiritual movement becomes unrestrained** (*língyùn pǔtōng*),
pervading the entire body, filling all space—
just as the **Heavenly Emperor’s divided Body of Law** (*fènshēn*) fills the **Great Celestial Palaces**.

When **the mortal form attains marvelous transformation** (*fánshēn dámiào*),
**exquisite treasures manifest naturally** (*zhìbǎo chéngqí*),
the **Pearl Towers** (*Zhūlóu*), **Treasure Halls** (*Bǎodiàn*), **Jade Palaces** (*Qiónggōng*), and **Yao Platforms** (*Yáotái*)—
these are the **White Jade Capital**, the **Golden Gates**, and the **Seven Treasures’ Mystic Gardens** (*Qībǎo Xuányuàn*) of heaven.

The **Divine Halls** (*Shén gōng*) and **Elixir Platforms** (*Dāntái*)—
these are the **Great Light’s Hall** (*Dàguāngmíng Diàn*) and the **Treasure Seat of Light** (*Guāngmíng Zuò*).

When **qi is harmonized** (*qì hé*) and **pulses are unobstructed** (*mài chàng*),
**divine light moves** (*guāng dòng*) and **celestial clouds rise** (*xiá yáng*),
this is the **Mystic Law Banner**, the **auspicious canopy**, and the **divine pavilions** (*fǎchuāng jiéyān fánshì*).

The **numinous growth of sacred herbs** (*shénzhī zhī xiù*)—
again, these are the **heavenly marvelous flowers** (*tiānshàng qíhuā*).

When the **Primordial Spirit** (*yuánshén*) **ascends in divine power** (*shén yù*) and **governs the Elixir Platform** (*zhǎi dāntái*),
**spreading luminous secrets** (*fūlíng xiǎnmì*)—
this is the **Heavenly Emperor’s divided Body of Law** (*fènshēn*), ascending simultaneously to each seat and proclaiming the **Law** (*shuōfǎ*).

My **true nature** (*zhēnxìng*)—
**enduring through kalpas** (*lìjiè*) without decay,
**undual and unadulterated** (*wú'èr wúzá*),
**unrestrained and unobstructed** (*wújū wújìan*),
**fundamentally pure and undefiled** (*běn qīngjìng bùrǎn*),
**naturally liberated** (*tuōluò zìrán*),
**greatly illuminated without dimness** (*dàmíng bùmèi*)—

can **ascend in divine power** (*shén yù*) and **spread luminous secrets** (*fūlíng xiǎnmì*),
then **every part of my body becomes mystically transformed** (*biàn yīshēn jiē xuánhuà*).
**Circulating through the Three Thousand Worlds** (*zhōu sāniàn wújū wǒ*), **comprehending causality** (*míngliǎo yīnyuán*),
**unveiling ultimate reality** (*bùmèi shíjì*),
**radiant throughout** (*biǎolǐ yíngchè*),
**exhausting divine mysteries** (*qióngshén dáhuà*)—
this is the **Heavenly Emperor’s teaching of liberation and transcendence** (*jiětuō qīngjìng zhī dào*), **illuminating all worlds** (*jiàohuà gé shìjiè*).

**Those who attain** (*Dá zhě*) **taste this meaning** (*wèi zhī*), **naturally recognize its truth** (*zì shí cǐ yì*).

**Eleven Chapters on Divine Penetration** (*Shéntōng Pǐn Shíyī Zhāng*):

At that time, the **Heavenly Emperor**, in His **divinized Body of Law** (*huàshēn*), manifests throughout all the **Great Celestial Palaces**.
He is attended by **infinite numbers of Heavenly True Ones** (*Wújiànliàng Tiānshàng Zhūzhēn Dàsì*), **Sages of Marvelous Practice** (*miàoxíng zhēnrén*), **Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens** (*língfēi yùnǚ*), who stand and array themselves at His sides.

These **Jade Maidens** (*Qǐyùnǚ*)—
their **complexion and bearing** (*yánróng xiōngróng*) are **exquisitely beautiful** (*mèimiào*),
**upright and adorned** (*duānlì qí tè*), **marvelously unique** (*qíhuā xiāozé*).
With **heavenly treasures and divine marvels** (*tiānzhēn shényì zhībǎo*), they **adorn the Emperor’s sacred form** (*zhuāngyán shēnxiàng*).
Their **speech and voice** (*yányīn*) are **clear and penetrating** (*qīngmíng tōngchè*), **pleasing to all** (*zhòngsuǒ lèwén*).

These **Jade Maidens**—
their bodies further emit **subtle, numinous, and liberating fragrances** (*wēimiào jiětuō zìrán zhīxiāng*).
This fragrance is **aromatic and fragrant** (*fēnfú yùfú*), pervading all the **heavenly realms of supreme bliss** (*jiéshénmiào kuàilè zhī jìngtǔ*)
and all the **great earthly worlds of auspicious gatherings** (*zhōngdà dì shìjiè yīqiè fúhuì zhī chù*).

**Queen Mother of the West** (*Wángmǔ*) says:
At that time, the **Heavenly Emperor**, in His **divinized Body of Law** (*huàshēn*), manifests throughout all the **Great Celestial Palaces**.
He is attended by **infinite numbers of Heavenly True Ones** (*Wújìnliàng Tiānshàng Zhūzhēn Shéntōng Dàsì*), **Sages of Marvelous Practice and Divine Transformation** (*língyùn biànhuà miàoxíng zhuāngyán zhēnrén*), **Numinous Consorts** (*língtōng xiānfēi*), and **Protecting Saints’ Jade Maidens** (*hùshèng yùnǚ*), who stand and array themselves at His sides.

These **Jade Maidens**—
their **visage and form** (*yánmiàn xíngróng*) are **beautiful and surpassingly unique** (*xiōuměi qímiào duānzhèng huálì shénqí tèmài*).
With **heavenly treasures and divine marvels** (*tiānzhēn shényì zhībǎo*), they **adorn the Emperor’s sacred form** (*zhuāngyán shēnxiàng*).
Their **speech and voice** (*yányīn yīnshēng*) are **clear and penetrating** (*qīngmíng tōngchè*), **most pleasing to all** (*dàzhòng suǒ lè tīngwén*).
Their bodies further emit **subtle, numinous, and liberating fragrances** (*Xuánwēi shénmiào dàjiětuō zìrán zhī xīnxiāng*).
This fragrance is **aromatic and fragrant** (*fēnfú yùfú*), pervading all the **heavenly realms of supreme bliss** (*zhōng Tiānyōng jíshénmiào kuàilè zhī jìngtǔ*)
and all the **great earthly worlds of auspicious gatherings** (*bìng biànjí zhōngdà dì shìjiè yīqiè fúhuì zhī chù*).

**Examining the Meaning** (*Kǎoyì yún*) says:
**Marvelous Practice** (*Miàoxíng*)—
humans possess **various virtues** (*zhūshàn*), yet they do not **forcefully contrive** (*bù jiǎ qiángwéi*).
Their **merits and virtues** (*gōngdé*) are **exhaustless** (*bùqióng*), fundamentally arising from **naturalness** (*zìrán*) and thus becoming **True Ones** (*zhēnrén*).
Then, their **divine penetrations** (*shéntōng*) are **boundless** (*mòliàng*).
Hence, it is called **Marvelous Practice** (*miàoxíng*).

**Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens** (*Língfēi Yùnǚ*)—
are **divine transformations** (*miàohuà*) of the **yin-dharma subtle qi** (*yīnfàn miàoqì*).
They **guard and protect the Emperor’s True Nature** (*gǒngwèi Dìzhēn*).
All **celestial maidens** (*Tiānshàng shénnǚ*) are thus named.
**Without desire or entanglement** (*wúyù wúlèi*), they differ from **demonic maidens** (*mófù*).

With **virtue and power** (*dé gōng*) both complete,
**noble, beautiful, and exalted** (*guìměi zūnlíng*),
**pure and unadulterated, forever without obstruction** (*chúnjié yǒngwú jiànzá*),
they are called **Numinous Consorts and Jade Maidens** (*Língfēi Yùnǚ*).
This is not solely referring to the **Emperor’s consort** (*Dìhòu*).

These **Jade Maidens**—
their **complexion and bearing** (*yánróng xiōngróng*) are **exquisitely beautiful** (*mèimiào*).
**Maiden** (*xiōu*)—beauty.
**Upright** (*duān*)—solemn and proper.
**Adorned** (*lì*)—luxuriant and radiant.
**Unique** (*qí*)—divinely marvelous, rarely seen.
**Surpassing** (*tè*)—transcending all beauty, **unmatched in the world** (*shìwú bǐlún*).

With **heavenly treasures adorning their sacred form** (*tiānzhēn zhuāngyán shēnxiàng*),
these **celestial maidens** (*Tiānshàng fēi*)—
**mystic light** (*Xuánguāng*) and **divine transformation** (*shénhuà*)—
**exquisite treasures adorning their form** (*miàobǎo zhuāngyán*), their **physique and bearing** (*qítǐ qíróng*)
are **unseen in the world** (*shìsuǒ wèijiàn*).

Their **speech and voice** (*yányīn*) are **clear and penetrating** (*qīngmíng tōngchè*).
**Speech** (*yán*)—speech and language.
**Voice** (*yīn*)—sound and tone.

**Clear** (*qīng*)—distinct and lucid.
**Penetrating** (*chè*)—pervasive and resonant throughout.

**Subtle and wondrous liberation** (*wéimiào jiětuō*)—natural fragrance:
The **celestial maidens** (*fēi*) attain enlightenment, achieving **great liberation** (*dà jiětuō*).
Their **mystic mechanisms** (*xuánjī*) are unfathomable, their **divine subtlety** (*shénmiào*) immeasurable.
No artificial contrivance is needed—**naturally fragrant** (*zìrán xīnxiāng*).
Yet the source of this fragrance is unknown—hence, **subtle and wondrous** (*wéimiào*).

This fragrance is **aromatic and rich** (*fēnfù*):
**Aromatic** (*fēn*)—beautiful qi spreading and dispersing.
**Rich** (*fù*)—profoundly fragrant and abundant.

It pervades all **celestial realms of supreme bliss** (*jiémào lètǔ*):
**Pervasive** (*zhōu*)—comprehensive and all-encompassing.
**Extensive** (*biàn*)—broadly manifest.
**Supreme** (*jí*)—most exalted.

In the **great celestial palaces** (*dà tiān gōng*), where **jade maidens** (*yùnǚ*) serve as **manifestations of the Jade Emperor** (*yùdì huàshēn*), this fragrance does not cease at one place but spreads throughout all **worlds and heavens**, creating **blissful realms without suffering** (*wúkǔ lètǔ*).

The **great earth** (*dàdì*)—speaking of mountains, rivers, and worlds.
A **blessed realm** (*fúchù*)—wherever there is a world, there is birth and formation, hence **blessed realm**.

Some say that through **reverence and sincere faith** (*gōngjìng jīngxìn*), one may then hear this **marvelous fragrance** (*yìxiāng*).
All worlds receive the **radiance of the Jade Emperor** (*yùdì guāng*), generating faith, and thus encounter the **celestial maidens’ wondrous fragrance** (*língfēi yùnǚ miàoxiāng*), hence **blessed realm**.
This is also correct.

All beings of the **Six Paths** (*liùdào*), upon hearing this fragrance, universally attain **enlightenment and liberation** (*kāiduò zhīhuì*).
The **Six Paths** (*liùdào*)—**heavenly path** (*tiāndào*), **human path** (*réndào*), **demonic path** (*módào*), **hellish path** (*dìyùdào*), **hungry ghost path** (*èguǐdào*), **animal path** (*chùshēngdào*).

If those in the **heavenly path** (*tiāndào*), including all celestial beings (*tiānrén*), hear this fragrance, their **five decayed and four ugly forms** (*wǔshuāi sìchǒng*) are permanently eliminated, and their **celestial blessings** (*tiānfú*) are enhanced.

If those in the **human path** (*réndào*), including kings, ministers, and common folk, hear this fragrance, they attain the **longevity bliss of humans and heavens** (*rén tiān chángshòu zhīlè*).
If their bodies perish and they transcend, they attain the **path of shell-shedding and corpse-resurrection** (*tuōké sǐjiě zhīdào*).

If those in the **demonic path** (*módào*), all demons, hear this fragrance, they find rest in celestial palaces, free from the suffering of battle and strife.

If those in the **hellish path** (*dìyùdào*), all guilty souls, hear this fragrance, they escape hell’s torments and attain the bliss of a **pure land** (*jìngtǔ*).

If those in the **hungry ghost path** (*èguǐdào*), all hungry ghosts, hear this fragrance, they become sated, free from hunger and thirst.

If those in the **animal path** (*chùshēngdào*), all suffering beasts, hear this fragrance, they escape animal suffering and attain the bliss of **wisdom and clarity** (*zhìhuì cōngmíng*).

The **Sage of Rescue from Suffering** (*Jiùkǔ Tiānzūn*) says:
All beings in the **Six Paths**, upon hearing the **celestial maidens’ natural fragrance** (*língfēi zìrán zhīxiāng*), universally receive the grace of **enlightenment and liberation** (*kāihuà bádù*).

The **Six Paths** (*liùdào*)—paths like roads, where beings undergo **cyclical rebirth** (*lúnzhuǎn*) within six realms, hence **Six Paths**.

First, the **heavenly path** (*tiāndào*): Heaven has **thirty-six names**, with the highest four heavens called **seed-citizens** (*zhǒngmín*), where **seven treasures and nine august celestial beings** reside. The **Buddhist teachings** call this the **non-regressing realm** (*bùtuì zhuǎn zhīdì*).

Below the **seed-citizens**, there are the **four exalted secret heavens** (*sìchóng mìtiān*), which the **Buddhist teachings** call the **four Brahma heavens** (*sìfàn tiān*).

Below the **exalted secret heavens**, there are the **four forgetful-form heavens** (*sìwàng xiàng tiān*), which the **Buddhist teachings** call the **four *jhāna* heavens** (*sìqián tiān*), i.e., the **formless realm** (*wúsè jiè*).

Below the **forgetful-form heavens**, there are the **eighteen heavens of the form realm** (*sèjiè shíbā tiān*).

Below the **eighteen heavens of the form realm**, there are the **six heavens of the desire realm** (*yùjiè liù tiān*).

One world contains **thirty-six heavens**, all worlds being the same.

The **four kinds of celestial citizens** (*sìzhǒng mín tiān*)—**void and wondrous existence** (*xūwú miàoyǒu*), **mystic transformation and divine spirit** (*miàohuà xuánshén*)—are **eternally uncorrupted**, inhabited only by **highest sages and true immortals**, with no celestial beings. They are not counted among the **heavenly paths**.

The **four exalted secret heavens**—**slightly defiled yet pure**, **partially transformed yet not divine**, **not yet attaining the Great Vehicle**.
Though they belong to the **human path** (*réndào*), even the **great eon** cannot spare them from decline.

The **formless realm** (*wúsè jiè*), **form realm** (*sèjiè*), and **desire realm** (*yùjiè*)—
All **celestial beings** (*tiānrén*) are **tall and majestic**, their forms like **white silver**, not dependent on sunlight or moonlight for illumination, yet **self-luminous**.
The **day-moon heavens** (*rìyuè tiān*) have beings **five *li*** in height; higher realms increase gradually, reaching **a hundred *yojanas*** in stature (*yóushù zhīgāo*), with one *yojana* being **forty *li***.

The **Dao scriptures** say: **"Exceeding the abode"** (*yúshè*), they wear **heavenly robes** (*tiān yī*) weighing **six *catty*, two *qian*, and five *fen***.
Their heads are crowned with **natural pearl diadems** (*zìrán zhūguān*), their eyes do not blink (*mù bù shùn*), their heads do not bow (*tóu bù fǔ*), they stand without leaning (*lì bù yǐ*), their eyes shed no tears (*yǎn wú lèi*), and their bodies know no fatigue (*shēn wú kùnpi*).
If they fail to awaken to the **Great Vehicle** (*dàchéng*), when their **celestial blessings** (*tiānfú*) are exhausted, their **pearl diadems shatter**, their eyes weep in rain (*mù shùn yǔ lèi*), their bodies bend and weary (*shēn qū xíng pi*), and the **five decays and four ugly forms** (*wǔshuāi sìchǒng*) manifest.

If one receives the **natural fragrance** (*zìrán xiāng*) of the Dao, with **sincere faith** (*jīngxìn*) and **reverent devotion** (*gōngjìng*), and awakens to its **subtle and wondrous origin** (*miào xiāng zhī yóu*), they will **suddenly attain harmony** (*dùn qì dàdào*) with the Great Way, not needing to seek this fragrance from without, and thus achieve **enlightenment** (*liáo wò*). This is called **the able hearer** (*néng wén*).

The **five decays and four ugly forms** (*wǔshuāi sìchǒng*) are **permanently eliminated** (*yǒng dé xiāochú*). **永** (*yǒng*) means **eternal** (*eternal*). **终** (*zhōng*) means **final** (*final*). When one is **finally freed** (*zhōng miǎn*) from the suffering of decay and ugliness, their **celestial blessings** (*tiānfú*) are **turned to increase** (*zhuǎn zēng*). **转转进益** (*zhuǎn zhuǎn jìn yì*), their blessings grow without bound—**never exhausted** (*bù tuì jìn*).

Human paths vary: there are **youth and age, male and female** (*yīnyáng lǎoshào*), there are **noble and ignoble, poor and rich** (*guìbiàn pínfù*), and there are **sages and fools, wise and dull** (*shèngxián zhìyú*). Without attaining the Great Way, their **lifespan is limited** (*shòu suàn bù cháng*), and death comes **with great difficulty** (*sǐ zhī shèn nán*). Their **corpse cannot transform** (*shī bù néng huà*).

In every realm, **emperors, ministers, and all officials—great and small—along with the countless common people** (*zǎoshì zhūmín*). A **million** (*qiān wàn*) is called a **myriad** (*zǎo*), and **庶** (*shì*) means **the masses** (*the masses*). **兆庶** (*zǎoshì*) refers to all people, **extreme in number** (*extreme in number*).

If one can receive the **natural fragrance** (*zìrán xiāng*) and **awaken to the Great Way** (*liáo wò dàdào*), they will also **skillfully perceive its refined subtlety** (*xīn miào*), and thus attain the **joy of boundless longevity** (*wú guǎi chángshòu zhī lè*) in the Dao of humans and heavens. Even if they perish, they will **mysteriously escape the mortal coil** (*mì miào tuō qì ké*), **transcend the body** (*shī jiě xiān huà*), and achieve **immortal transformation** (*xiān huà*).

**脱壳** (*Tuō ké*) means **to shed the physical shell**—whether through **sitting ascension** (*zuò tuō*) or **standing ascension** (*lì wáng*), or by **seizing another’s rebirth** (*tóu tāi duó shè*). **尸解** (*Shī jiě*) means **corpse dissolution**—either when **this body dies** (*cǐ yǐ sǐ*) and another **manifests in the world** (*xiǎn shēn yú shìjiān*), with both **corpse and soul departing** (*shī hún bìng qù*); or when one **feigns death and ascends** (*jiǎ sǐ ér shēng*).

For all **paths of demons** (*móudào*), the demonic kinds vary. **唂嘶啰与** (*wū sī luó yǔ*)—like the **Asuras** (*xiūluó*) and **Rakshasas** (*guǐní*)—**contend with the Heavenly Sovereign** (*tiān dì zhēng héng*), **disturbing celestial officials** (*dòu luàn tiān guān*).

All demonic paths either **delight in warfare** (*hào zhànzhēng*), **create illusions and terrors** (*zuò huàn lì*), or dwell in **restlessness and perpetual turmoil** (*jū chù bù ān, cháng wú xiūxī*). If such demons hear the **natural wondrous fragrance** (*zìrán miào xiāng*), and **awaken to the Dao’s true nature** (*néng wò dàozhēn*), then they will **abandon evil and follow righteousness** (*gǎi xié cóng zhèng*), dwell in **tranquility** (*jū chù ānrán*), and **guard their inherent stations** (*shǒu qí sù wèi*). In the **separate celestial ranks** (*tiān bié guān*), they will no longer **take pleasure in contention, disturbance, or warfare** (*lè fēn zhēng, dòu luàn zhànfá zhī kǔ*), and thus **each attains rest and respite** (*gè dé xiūxī*).

Those who suffer in **battle and war** (*dòu zhàn kǔ*)—**wounded in contention** (*dòu luàn bì shāng*), **killed in battle** (*zhànfá bì shā*)—**mutually triumph and defeat** (*hù shèng hù bài*), **becoming foes in endless cycle** (*jiāo wéi kòu chóu*)—thus it is said they suffer. **Each attains rest** (*gè dé xiūxī*), for though their **spirit does not harm demons** (*shén suī bù qīn móu*), if they are **disturbed by demons** (*wéi móu suǒ luàn*), they will **respond and subdue them** (*yìng biàn fú móu*).

Now, when these demons hear the fragrance and awaken to its subtlety, dwelling in peace without strife, their **spirit also finds no cause for action** (*shén yì wú shì*). **Spirit and demons alike are at rest** (*shén móu xī ān*), hence it is said that **each attains rest and respite** (*gè dé xiūxī*).

In all realms, the **hells** (*dìyù*)—though not limited to one name—are called **Changdu** (*Qīngdū*), **Blood Lake** (*Xuèhú*), **Blood Pass** (*Xuèxiá*), **Frigid Ice** (*Hánbīng*), **Flame Chariot** (*Huǒchē*), **Mountain of Knives** (*Dāoshān*), **Forest of Swords** (*Jiànshù*), **River of Love** (*Àihé*), **Restraining Mind** (*Zhìxīn*), **Iron Bed** (*Tiěchuáng*), **Blade of Wind** (*Fēngdāo*), **Iron Hounds** (*Tiěgǒu*), **Bronze Serpents** (*Tóngshé*), **Crucible of Boiling Iron** (*Liáo huò*), **Sawing Asunder** (*Jújiě*), **Grinding** (*Mó*), **Flaying and Picking** (*Bōtì*), **Plow of Mud** (*Ní lí*), **Tongue-Tearing** (*Bá shé*), and **thus up to the thirty-six hells** (*yǐjí sānshíliù yù*).

All **suffering souls** (*shòuzuì zhūhún*) in these hells are **inherently difficult to free** (*běn nán lí dìyù qīuxíng zhī kǔ*). If they hear this **natural fragrance** (*zìrán xiāng*), they will **awaken and transcend** (*néng liáo wò, suí dé chāotuō*), **escaping the hells’ torments** (*chūlí dìyù zhūkǔ*), and **reborn in a land of pure bliss** (*dé shēng qīngjìng lètǔ*).

For **hungry ghosts** (*èguǐ*) and **exhausted souls** (*lìjié qiónghún*) long bound in the **ghostly realm** (*guǐjí*), some have **narrow necks and swollen bellies** (*xì jǐng dà fù*), others **great heads with shrunken waists** (*shǒu dà fù xiǎo*), or **constricted throats** (*yān hóu bì sè*), or **consume charcoal and smoke** (*shí tàn yīn yān*), or **dine on molten copper** (*cān róng tóng*), or **swallow iron pellets** (*dàn tiě wán*), enduring **countless lifetimes without taste of water** (*lěi shì bù wén jiāngshuǐ*), **never encountering food** (*bù yù yǐnshí*), **starving and parched in agony** (*è nèi kě tòng*), though they **ever fret and lament** (*suī cháng yōu ào*).

In every realm, **all such hungry ghosts** (*rúshì èguǐ dào zhōng yīqiè èguǐ*)—if they hear this **natural fragrance** (*zìrán xiāng*), and **awaken to the Dao** (*néng wò dàodào*), then the **flavor of the Way fills their being** (*dào wèi chōng fù*), and they **attain satiety** (*jí dé bǎo mǎn*), **dispelling hunger and thirst** (*xiāochú jī kě*), **unblocking throat and palate** (*kāi míng hóu yān*), and **forever free from torment** (*yǒng wú è nǎo*).

For **beastly paths** (*chùshēng dào*), **all transformations—wet, dry, sluggish, or lively** (*mǎo huà shī yǒu zhuó dòng*)—are included, not just **birds and beasts** (*bù zhuān yán qín shòu*). Though **beasts are nurtured and ridden** (*chùshēng zhě suī xùyǎng yú tiān dì zhī wèn*) and **lack wisdom** (*wú yǒu zhìhuì*), their **karmic retribution is manifold and bitter** (*yèbào duō kǔ suī kǔ nán tuō*). Yet if all **beasts in every realm** (*gè shìjiè yīqiè chùshēng*) hear this **natural wondrous fragrance** (*zìrán miào xiāng*), and **awaken to the Dao** (*jí néng wò dàodào*), they will **attain this liberation** (*dé cǐ jiětuō*), their **karmic retribution exhausted** (*yèbào jí jìn*), and **escape the suffering of beasts** (*tuōlí chùshēng zhī kǔ*), attaining instead the **joy of keen wisdom** (*dé cōngmíng zhìhuì zhī lè*).

Beasts are **not without intelligence** (*chùshēng fēi wú zhì*), but they **cannot speak of the Dao** (*bù néng yán dàodào*), **cannot embody its truth** (*bù néng tǐ dàodào*), and their **forms differ, their spirits distinct** (*xíng yì shén shū*). Some are **domesticated and ridden** (*huàn yǎng chéng yù*), others **hunted and slaughtered** (*yúliè shā shí*), **falling into traps** (*tóu diàn jǐng*), **filled for the kitchen** (*chōng páochú*), **devoured raw and blood-drenched** (*rú máo yǐn xiě, pí gǔ suī jìn*), their **skins and bones consumed** (*zuì kǔ nán yán*). Hearing the fragrance, they **attain wisdom** (*jí dé zhìhuì*), all through the **Sovereign’s radiant law** (*dìguāng fǎlì yě*).

The **limited perspective** (*guǎn jiàn*) says: The **two preceding sections** (*shàng liǎng jié*) share a **single intent** (*jù yī yì*). The **original spirit** (*yuánshēn*) of the human body **oversees yin and yang** (*zǒng yù yīnyáng*), embodying the **true and wondrous conduct** (*zhēn shèng miào xíng*), the **divine consort and royal daughter** (*líng fēi wáng nǚ suī yǒu*). Within the **Great Harmony** (*tàihé*), the **spirit, qi, essence, and blood** (*shén qì jīng xuè*) all contain this **marvelous fragrance** (*jiētuō zìrán xiāng*), **liberating by nature** (*miào miào nán qióng yě*), **subtle and boundless** (*wēimiào nán qióng yě*).

When **qi is imbalanced** (*qì zhī piānzhèng*), it is **not from inherent madness or folly** (*fēi kuángyú shìfèn*), yet they too **fall into the Six Paths** (*yǒu liùdào*). Only when the **Heavenly Sovereign’s governance is unbalanced** (*tiān jūn bù tài*), are they **constrained by the Five Phases** (*wéi wǔxíng suǒ jū*); or when **thoughts are not severed** (*niàn tóu bù duàn*), **flitting and chaotic** (*fēnfēn rǎorǎo*), are they **controlled by yin and yang** (*wéi yīnyáng suǒ zhì*).

These too are **those who endure the Six Paths’ revolving torments** (*shì yě shòu liùdào lún zhuǎn zhě yě*). If one **beholds their own body’s beauty** (*dǔ jǐ shēn liùdīng yùnǚ zhī měi*), **hears the Great Harmony’s natural fragrance** (*wén tàihé jiětuō zìrán zhī xiāng*), and **comprehends the Great Way** (*míng chè dàdào*), then their **original spirit remains ever resplendent** (*shǐ yuánshēn cháng huàn*), and they **behold the Sovereign’s radiance** (*jí shǐ dǐguāng ér xiān huà*), **transcending dust and mundanity** (*yǒng tuō chén fán, bù wéi shēn jū*), and thus **forever freed from the Six Paths’ suffering** (*shì yě yǒng tuō liùdào zhī kǔ yě*).

Those who **attain** (*dá*) will **taste its meaning** (*zhī wèi yǎn*), **recognizing the two sections’ intent** (*zì shí liǎng jié zhī yì*).

**The Twelve Chapters on Spiritual Penetration** (*Shéntōng pǐn shí'èr zhāng*)
At that time, **all the assembled beings of Heavenly Retribution** (*zhūshìng tiānzuì zhūhún*), having **obtained rebirth in this Victorious Heavenly Palace** (*yuán dé shēng shì shèng tiān gōng yě*), **owing to their reception of the Compassionate Light** (*yuán dé chéng cíguāng shè shòu zhī gǔ*), **immediately awaken** (*biàn dé jiào wò*), **each clearly understanding the causes of guilt and blessing** (*gè gè míng liǎo zuìfú yīnyuán*), and **with their attendants** (*yǔ zhū quànshǔ*), they **perform celestial arts and music** (*zuò tiān jì yīn jì*), **their devotion fervent** (*qí yī qiè*). **伎** (*jì*) means **art** (*art*). Some texts read **伎** (*jì*) as **乐** (*yìng lè*).
The **倚切** (*yī qiè*) and **渠纪切** (*qú jì qiè*) pronunciations align with **与** (*yǔ*), so **伎** (*jì*) should follow the **乐** (*lè*) meaning.
They **rejoice and come before the Sovereign** (*lè lái yì dì qián*).

「This is when all the guilty beings, each filled with sorrow, simultaneously raised their voices to speak: *"Your servants have traversed countless kalpas—both great and small—without ever seeing the Three Lights of sun, moon, and stars. We have always dwelled in the depths of darkness, plunged into the Three Evil Paths of hell, hungry ghosts, and animals, enduring endless suffering and torment."*

Now, as we have received the **Emperor’s** (*Yuánshǐ Dì*) **compassionate illumination** (*cíguāng*), **divine grace** (*mìhuà*) has transformed us into **True Fragrance** (*zhēn xiāng*), and due to the **Emperor’s boundless virtue and luminous compassion** (*Dàcí guāngmíng*) **that encompasses and guides us** (*shè shòu zhī gǔ*), we have all **awakened to the Great Dao** (*Dàdào*), **each now comprehending the profound causes of guilt and blessing** (*zuìfú yīnyuán*).

**Encompass** (*shè*), here, means **to receive, guide, and uphold** (*jiēyǐn bǎochí*). **Guide** (*shòu*), here, means **to summon the soul and spirit** (*jiēyǐn húnshén*), **inviting them to return to their true nature** (*chào zhī guīzhēn*). When the **Emperor releases His compassionate light** (*cíguāng*), it **miraculously manifests as True Fragrance** (*zhēn xiāng*), **encompassing and guiding all guilty beings** (*zuìzhòng*), who **immediately awaken** (*jiào*), **grasping their true nature** (*zhī qí suǒyǐrán*), and **penetratingly understand** (*chè tōng*).

The guilty beings, having **awakened and comprehended**, **escape the Three Evil Paths** (*sǔn qí sān èdào qù*), **each now clearly and thoroughly understanding** (*gè gè míng tōng liǎo chè*), **deeply knowing the causes of guilt and blessing** (*zuìfú yīnyuán*). **Cause** (*yīn*) refers to **root** (*fēnggēn*), meaning that **where there is cause, there is effect** (*yǒu yīn zé yǒu guǒ*). **Connection** (*yuán*) refers to **proximity** (*yóulái*), meaning that **where there is connection, there is karma** (*yǒu yuán zé yǒu yè*). Once the guilty beings **clearly understand the causes and effects of their guilt and virtue** (*zuìyè fúdé yīnguǒ yuángù*), along with their **kindred and companions** (*qīnchūn zhùshǔ*), they **perform celestial arts and wondrous music** (*tiān jì miàolè*) before the **Emperor’s throne** (*yì Dì qián*).

**Celestial arts** (*tiān jì*), when **interpreted through the term "art"** (*yì*), signifies **their perfection and boundless mastery** (*qiánwéi bùtōng*). **To come before** (*lái yì*), here, means **to arrive** (*zhì*). These are the guilty beings who have been **reborn in heaven**, each now **filled with sorrow** (*bāohán zhuó*), as they **utter their voices in lamentation** (*jù fā shēngyán*): *"Your servants, through countless kalpas past and present, have never seen the Three Lights—sun, moon, and stars—always dwelling in the gloom of darkness, fallen into the Three Evil Paths of hell, hungry ghosts, and animals, enduring much suffering and anguish."*

**To bow humbly** (*fú*), here, means **to prostrate oneself on the ground** (*jūshēn fǔfú dìxià*). **To receive** (*méng*), here, means **to accept from above and below** (*yǎngshòu yǐngbèi*). The phrase *"as we have received"* (*fú méng*) is used **to express lowly submission to the exalted** (*wēicéng yǐngzūn*), and should be understood as such. Later, when the text says *"received"* (*méng*), it follows this same convention.

The **Emperor’s compassionate light** (*cíguāng*) **permeates all with boundless wisdom** (*pùxíng dàomìàorén dé biànyì*), **allowing us to benefit greatly** (*dé biànyì*). Once this **compassionate light is released** (*fàng*), **He takes pity and rescues us** (*liánmǐn jiùbá wǒdéng*), **enabling all to be reborn in heaven** (*jiēdé shēng yú tiānshàng*). These **evil deeds and their suffering karmic retributions** (*èkǔ yèbào*) are **all eradicated and exhausted** (*xījiē chúmiè liǎojìn*), **with no lingering bonds or hindrances** (*wú zhōngxì hùliǎn*), and **all attain rebirth in the heavens** (*jiēdé wǎngshēng zhūtiān*), **paying homage to the Jade Sovereign Emperor** (*yǎngcháo Yùhuáng Dìshàng*), **each arriving at the Dao’s boundless origin** (*gè gè zhì Dàodào qiánmiàn*).

When the **reborn heavenly beings and all guilty ones** (*shēngtiān zuìzhòng*) **finish speaking these words**, they **prostrate themselves and return to their original positions** (*qǐshǒu fùguī yuánshì lì*).

**The Fool’s Reflection** (*Yú’àn*): **"Humans are born with yin and yang** (*rén bǐng yīnyáng*), **inherently the same as heaven and earth** (*yǔ tiāndì běnlái xiāngtóng*). Yet, **ensnared by desires and greed** (*nì yú lìyù*), they **defile and sink their true hearts** (*wū xiàn zhēnxīn*), **persisting in evil without repentance** (*cháng è bù quān*), and **consider the wheel of retribution** (*bàoyìng zhuánlún*) as nonexistent—**this is ignorance of the causes of guilt and blessing** (*bùzhī zuìfú yīnyuán*). Thus, **the harmony of the Dao is lost** (*miào hé zhēnyì wúyǒu*), and they are **ensnared by the mundane constraints** (*bì yú chénsú zhī gāng*), **clinging to lust, anger, delusion, and jealousy** (*tānchīn chǐmìng*), **lost in madness, sorrow, and fleeting joy** (*kuángluàn bēixǐ*), **obsessed with desires and seeking fame** (*shìyù qiúmíng*), **never realizing the true path** (*bùjiàn liǎoqī*). This is why they **always dwell in darkness** (*chángchǔ hēi’àn*), **like the beings of hell, hungry ghosts, and animals** (*rú dìyù èguǐ chùshēng zhī zài sān èdào zhōng*), **enduring torment day and night** (*zhòuyè áojiān*), **just as the guilty beings suffer greatly** (*yì yú zhūzuìzhòng duōshòu kǔnǎo yībān*).

This is the **state of those whose evil deeds are not exhausted** (*èyè bùjìn*), **bound by lingering karmic ties** (*yǒu xì hù bùdé shēngtiān*), **who cannot be reborn in heaven** (*zhī zuìzhòng*). When the **True Spirit governs** (*yuánshén yù*), **heavenly light shines forth** (*tiān guāng fā*), the **yin-qi and impure thoughts of the body** (*yīnqì zázhì èqù*) all **return to pure qi** (*shēng zhēngqì*), **ascending to the Nine Yang Realms** (*shēng jiǔyáng jìnghuì*). **Knowing the distinctions between goodness, evil, mundanity, and sainthood** (*zhī shàng è fánshèng zhī guān*), they **move swiftly with the Dao’s influence** (*jié yú yǐngxiǎng*), **and retribution becomes manifest** (*bàoyìng zhāorán*).

This is the **release of the Supreme Harmony’s rhythm** (*xì Tàihé zhī yùn*), **revealing the sacred essence** (*chéng língmì*), **and honoring the Primordial Emperor** (*lǐ Yuánhuáng*), **which is when the guilty beings, having received the Emperor’s compassionate light** (*chéng Dì cíguāng shèshòu*), **each now understand the causes of guilt and blessing** (*gè míng zuìfú yīnyuán*), **and with their kindred and companions** (*yǔ zhū quànshǔ*), **perform celestial arts and music** (*zuò tiān jì miàolè*), **coming before the Emperor’s throne** (*lái yì Dì qián*).

When **yin-qi dissipates** (*yīnqì xiāo*), **impure thoughts are forgotten** (*zázhì wàng*), **and evil paths are purified** (*èqù jìng*), **transforming evil into goodness** (*yì è wéi shàn*), **returning to spirit and fate** (*guīshén guīmìng*), **repenting and awakening to self-correction** (*huǐwù chéngchuàng*), they **know that evil deeds bring misfortune** (*zìzhī zuò è bùxiáng*). **Without awakening to the Great Dao** (*bùjiào Dàdào*), they are **like those facing a wall or sitting in a well** (*rú tóng miànqiáng zuòjǐng*), **truly seeing nothing** (*zhēng wú suǒjiàn*). **Obscured by the paths of the Three and Two** (*bì yú cān sān èr èr zhī tú*), they **fall into endless worry and fear** (*suì duō yōujù*).

Only when the **True Spirit governs the Pure Palace** (*yuánshén yù qióngtái*), **descending truth and summoning essence** (*jiàngzhēn yǐnlíng*), **miraculously emitting the mysterious radiance** (*miào fā xuānhuī*), **transforming yin into the boundless field** (*huà yīn quánchǎng*), **and thoroughly escaping mundanity** (*liǎo tuō chénfán*), **are they forever free from entanglements** (*yǒngwú zhōngliǚ*), **their hearts aligned with the Dao** (*xīntóng yú Dào*), **silently paying homage to the Emperor** (*mò cháo Dìshàng*). This is when the **guilty beings, filled with sorrow** (*zuìzhòng bāohán*), **speak of their suffering through countless kalpas of darkness** (*zìyán lièjié yōu’àn zhī kǔ*), **having received the Emperor’s light and been rescued by His compassion** (*fú méng Dì guāng liánmǐn jiùbá*), **freed from evil deeds** (*miǎn èyè*), **with no lingering bonds** (*wú xìhù*), **and attain rebirth in heaven** (*wǎngshēng cháo Dìshàng*), **arriving at the Dao’s origin** (*zhì Dàodào qiánmiàn*).

This is the **essence of the heavenly transformation** (*běn tiānshàng zhìshén miàohuà*). **Taking it from the self** (*jìn qǔ zhūshēn*), it means **that the Dao inherently exists within the body** (*dào běn zài shēn*), **and encourages humans to reflect and practice in truth** (*rén fǎn guān shíjìàn ěr*). Therefore, the four sentences above—**"prostrating themselves and returning to their original positions"** (*qǐshǒu fùguī yuánshì lì*)—do not require further elaboration.

**The Enlightened** (*Dázhě*) **will ponder this deeply** (*xiáng yán*). **End of Volume Two of the *Imperial Daoist Canon’s Commentary*** (*Huángjīng zhùjiě juàn zhī èr jìng*). **Volume Three of the *Imperial Daoist Canon’s Commentary*** (*Huángjīng zhùjiě juàn zhī sān*).

「The **Heavenly Master of the Fifty-First Daoist Generation** (*Zì Hàn wǔshí dài Tiānshī Dà Zhēnrén Zhāng Guóxīng* **校**) **—** the **Chancellor of the Way** (*Zhuàngyuán Fāngwài yǐn Jiāngxī Jìshuǐ Luó Hóngxiān* **阅**) **—** and **Little Master Zhao of Jinan** (*Shāndōng Jìnán xiǎo Zhàozhūn Zhōu Xuányán* **集**), together compiled the **Thirteenth Chapter on Divine Pervasiveness** (*Shéntōng pǐn shísān zhāng*).

At that time, the **Jade Sovereign** (*Yùdì*) emitted a **Great Mysterious Sound** (*Dà Miàoyīn*), proclaiming to the **sacred assemblies of the Ten Directions** (*Shí fāng zhū tiān shèngzhòng*): **"You all must listen closely** (*Rú qí dì tīng*), for these **multitudes of transgressors** (*zhè zhū zuìzhòng*), from **countless kalpas** (*kuàng jié yǐlái*) onward, though **endowed with the nature of ignorance** (*zòng wú míngxìng*), have **committed the Ten Evils** (*zào shí èyè*), been **pervasively stained by the Six Dusts** (*liù chén biàn rǎn*), and **ensnared by the Three Poisons** (*sān yè yíng chán*). They indulged their thoughts and desires, never once **awakening to their faults** (*céng wú juéwù*), accumulating **hidden sins** (*yīn zuì*) and **manifest transgressions** (*yáng guò*) daily and monthly, ever deeper.

They **abandoned the Dao and defied the True** (*bèidào wéizhēn*), followed **evil paths and discarded the Rectitude** (*shùn xié qì zhèng*), every **thought and intention** (*jǔxīn yùnniàn*) generating **karmic entanglements and offenses** (*dòng jié qiān yóu*). Thus, when their lives ended, their bodies **fell into the Three Realms of Suffering** (*sān tú*, i.e., **Hell, Hungry Ghosts, and Beasts** (*dìyù, èguǐ, chùshēng*)), unable to **attain liberation** (*bùdé jiětuō*).

**Had it not been for today**, when they **encountered this wondrous Dharma assembly** (*yù shì fǎ yàn*), how could they **escape the cycle of suffering** (*hé yóu chūlí*)?

The **Great Sovereign of the Purple Micro** (*Zǐwēi Dàdì*) declared: **"When the Radiant Light of Great Compassion was being received**, the Jade Sovereign emitted this Great Mysterious Sound. This Great Mysterious Sound—**pure, resonant, and luminous** (*qīng chè xiǎng míng*), **pervading the Three Thousand Great Realms** (*biàn jí sānqiān Dàjiè*)—was heard by all, **unmatched in its wondrousness** (*zhì miào zhuó lún*). Hence, it is called the **Mysterious Sound** (*Miàoyīn*). The Jade Sovereign instructed the **sacred assemblies of the Ten Directions** (*shí fāng gè shìjiè zhū tiān dì shèngzhēn shénzhòng*):

**"You all must listen closely** (*Rú qí dì tīng*). **You**, here—**listen with utmost clarity and sincerity** (*dì*, **详审真听** *xiáng shèn zhēn tīng*). The Jade Sovereign taught the sacred assemblies to **listen closely to His instruction** (*dì tīng jǐ zhī xùn*), and thus spoke of these **multitudes of transgressors** (*zhè zhū sān è zuìzhòng*) from **countless kalpas** (*kuàng jié yǐlái*) onward.

**Transgressors** (*zuìzhòng*) from **endless kalpas** (*lì jié yǐzhì cǐ shí*), though **indulging in ignorance’s nature** (*zòng fàng wú míng zhī xìng*),—**the nature inherently luminous and aware** (*xìng běn líng míng*), yet **lost in lustful desires and chaotic delusion** (*zòngqíng zìyù, kuáng huì bèiluàn*), **acting without restraint** (*rènxīn xiǎngwéi*), **forsaking their original pure and enlightened essence** (*bùfù běnrán língjué miàotǐ*)—are thus called **nature of ignorance** (*wú míngxìng*).

They **accumulated the Ten Evils** (*shí èyè jī quān*), which are:
- **Three Evils of the Body** (*shēn sān èyè*): **killing** (*shāshēng*), **stealing** (*tōudào*), and **licentiousness** (*yéyín*);
- **Three Evils of the Heart** (*xīn sān èyè*): **greed** (*tān*), **anger** (*zhēn*), and **delusion** (*chī*);
- **Four Evils of the Mouth** (*kǒu sì èyè*): **two-tongued speech** (*liǎngshé*), **malicious slander** (*è mà*), **flirtatious words** (*qǐyǔ*), and **falsehood** (*wàng yán*).

The **Ten Evils**, **accumulated and compounded** (*shí èyè jī quān*), led to **karmic fruition and retribution** (*zào èyè bào*), hence called **evil deeds** (*èyè*).

They were **pervasively stained by the Six Dusts** (*liù chén biàn rǎn*). The **Six Dusts** (*liù chén*) are the **six impure sense faculties** (*yǎn, ěr, bí, shé, shēn, yì liù gēn bù jìng*)—**eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind** (*wèi zhī liù chén*). Some say the **Six Dusts** are **wealth, beauty, fame, food, sleep, and private desires** (*cái, sè, míng, shí, shuì, zìbiàn sīxīn*), which is also acceptable.

**Within and without the body**, all were **defiled by dust** (*jiē shòu chén wū*), **not a single spot remaining pure** (*wú xiē qīngjìng*), hence the phrase **"pervasively stained"** (*biàn rǎn*).

They were **ensnared by the Three Poisons** (*sān yè yíng chán*). The **Three Poisons** (*sān yè*) are the **three defiling deeds of body, speech, and mind** (*shēn, kǒu, xīn zhī sān dú èyè*). Some say the **Three Poisons** are **past karmic deeds, present transgressions, and future karmic accumulation** (*wǎng yīn sùyè, jiànzài qiān yè, wèilái chōng yè*), which is also acceptable.

**Ensnared** (*yíng chán*) means **twisting and binding** (*xuán, fàn zhī yì*). Their **accumulated deeds weighed heavily** (*jī yè zhòng lèi*), like **ropes binding a person**, preventing them from **freeing themselves** (*bùdé tuōshēn*), hence **"ensnared"** (*yíng chán*).

They **indulged their thoughts without restraint** (*sì fàng yìsī*), **unable to curb themselves**, **following their own desires**, **never reflecting or repenting**, **committing hidden sins** (*yōuyín guò'è zhī yīn zuì*)—**known only to themselves** (*rén bù jiànwén, zìjǐ dú zhī*)—and **manifest transgressions** (*yáng guò*)—**visible to all** (*zhòng suǒ wénjiàn, bùnéng yǎnshì*), **errors uncorrected** (*cuòwù bù gǎi*).

Day by day, month by month, their **evil deeds deepened** (*rìrì jiànjī, yuèyuè yì shēn*), as they **abandoned the Dao and defied the True** (*bèidào wéizhēn*), **yielding to false paths and forsaking Rectitude** (*shùn xiétú, qì zhèngdào*). Every **thought and intention** (*jǔxīn yùnniàn*), every **karmic impulse** (*dòng jié*), **generated entanglements and offenses** (*quān yóu*), leading to their **final demise** (*mìngzhōng wángguò zhī hòu*), where their bodies **fell into the Three Realms of Suffering** (*sān tú*, i.e., **Hell, Hungry Ghosts, and Beasts** *dìyù, èguǐ, chùshēng*)—**unable to attain liberation and transcendence** (*bùdé jiěwù chāotuō*).

**Had it not been for this day**, when they **encountered this wondrous Dharma assembly** (*yù shì miàofǎ huì yàn*), how could they **escape the suffering of their deeds** (*hé yóu chūlí yèkǔ*)?

**In my humble opinion** (*Yú àn*): **The vital essence and spirit** (*rénshēn shénqì*) are **divided into yin and yang, purity and turbidity** (*fèn yīn yáng qīng zhuó*). Those who **follow yin inclinations** (*rèn yīn qù*), **indulge in turbid evil** (*zòng zhuó'è*), **yield to false thoughts** (*shùn xiéniàn*), and **abandon true intentions** (*qì zhēnyì*), thus **brewing karmic offenses** (*nàngchéng qiān'è*), find it **difficult to escape suffering** (*nán tuō yèkǔ*).

The **longer they accumulate evil**, the **less they understand the origins of their karmic retribution** (*bùzhī qí yèbào yóulái*), hence their **failure to awaken** (*suǒyǐ bùjuéwù*).

**When the Original Spirit is settled** (*Yuánshén dìngjū*), **wondrous intentions resonate** (*miào yì zhènfū*), **the body receives the divine** (*zhōushēn chénglíng*), and **harmony is achieved with the Mysterious and Profound** (*mòqì zhòng xuán*), **yang flourishes and yin wanes** (*yáng zhǎng yīn xiāo*), **transgressions are abandoned and sins extinguished** (*xiè qiān miè zuì*), **uniting with the True Dao** (*yú dào hézhēn*)—all **stem from the Great Awakening of Mysterious Understanding** (*shì miào juéwù Dàdì*), **recognizing the karmic causes of transgressions** (*shí quān yè guò zhī yuán yīn*).

The **ancients emphasized attaining knowledge as the gateway** (*gǔ rén yǐ zhìzhī wéi rùmén*), **truly insightful** (*liáng yǒu jiàn yǐ*). **Moreover, human nature is undivided** (*kuàng rénxìng wú èr shuō*), **good and evil arising from the mind alone** (*shàn'è jiē yóu xīn*). **The nature of ignorance is the Dharma-nature itself** (*wú míngxìng jí fǎxìng yě*). Thus, **obscured by ignorance, one becomes ordinary** (*zhē yǐn wéi fán*), **while awakening reveals the sacred** (*liǎo wù wéi shèng*).

**The distinction between the ordinary and the sacred hinges on a hair’s breadth** (*shèng kuáng zhī fèn, jiàn bù róng fā*). **If humans can curb their desires and return to their true nature** (*rén néng shèqíng guīxìng*), **settle their fate with divine spirit** (*mìngdìng shénlíng*), **grasp the subtle balance of reason and desire** (*dá lǐ yù zhī jǐ*), and **know the self-origin of dusty evil** (*zhī chén'è zhī zì*), they **suddenly free themselves from suffering** (*dùn tuō yèkǔ*), **harmonize in silence with the Mysterious and Profound** (*mòqì zhòng xuán*), and thus **the Jade Sovereign’s Mysterious Sound instructs the Ten Directions** (*yù shì fǎ yàn*), **those burdened by ignorance’s nature** (*zòngxìng zào'è*), **encountering the Dharma assembly** (*yù fǎ huì yàn*) and **escaping the Three Evil Paths** (*chūlí sān èdào*).

**If one regards the nature of ignorance as a burden** (*rú yǐ wú míngxìng wéi lèi*), **seeking the True while separating from it** (*lí cǐ qiú zhēn*), **this is to divide into two paths** (*shì fèn èr tú*), **and thus one cannot attain the Mysterious and Profound in unity** (*bùdé huì yī dá miào*).

**Students must ponder this deeply** (*xuézhě wán zhī, zì zhī chāofán zhī yào*).

**The Fourteenth Chapter on Divine Pervasiveness** (*Shéntōng pǐn shísì zhāng*): At that time, the **sacred assemblies of the Ten Directions**, transformed by the **Jade Sovereign’s divine form** (*zhū tiān huàshēn Yùdì*), **without moving from their places** (*bùdòng qí suǒ*), **transported and united the celestial and human** (*yí jiē tiān rén*), **all arriving beneath the assembly of the Original Beginning** (*jiē lìng dé zhì Qīngwēi Tiāngōng, zuìshàng Yùqīng shèngjìng, Yuánshǐ Dàozǔ huì xià*).

**These multitudes were unaware** (*zhè zhū zhòng děng, bùjué bùzhī*). At that moment, the **Heavenly Sovereign and the assembled multitudes** (*tiān zūn jí huì zhòng děng*), **seeing the Jade Sovereign’s divine form** (*jiàn shì shí fāng Yùdì huàshēn*), **all gathered before the Heavenly Sovereign** (*pǔ jiē lái jí Tiānzūn huì qián*), **like a boundless mirror of light** (*rú wúbiān míngjìng*), **reflecting all images** (*zhào zhū yǐngxiàng*), **mutually interpenetrating**.

At that time, the **great multitudes** (*shí zhū dàzhòng*), **prostrating and gazing in awe** (*qǐshǒu zhān yǎng Yùdì huàshēn*), **the most sacred and exalted among the sacred** (*shèngzhōng zuì zūn*), **increased their pure faith** (*zhǎngzhǎng qīngxìn*), **deepening their joyful resolve** (*yì jiā zhìlè*). Their **hearts were steadfast, without retreat** (*xīn wú tuì zhuǎn*), **rising with great firmness** (*qǐ dà jiāngù*).

The **Heavenly Sovereign, the Great Emperor** (*Tiānhuáng Dàdì*) proclaimed: **"When the Radiant Light of Great Compassion was being received**, the **divine forms of the various Heavenly Palaces** (*gè dà tiāngōng huàshēn zhī Yùdì*), **the Jade Sovereigns**, **employed their Great Divine Pervasiveness** (*jí yǐ dà shéntōng*), **majestic and unmoving** (*wēiwēi bùdòng*). **Their divine light, wondrous and transformative**, **transported and united the celestial and human** (*shè qí suǒ shén guāng miào yí jiē zhū tiān zhū rén*), **all arriving beneath the Heavenly Sovereign’s assembly** (*jiē lìng dé zhì Qīngwēi Tiāngōng, zuìshàng Yùqīng shèngjìng, Yuánshǐ Dàozǔ huì xià*).

The **Yùqīng** is the most exalted and unparalleled realm—**the Great Pure, Quiet, and Secret Heaven**. The **Sacred [□] Realm** is where the **Ultimate Truth** reigns, where **emptiness and wondrous manifestation** coalesce; even the gods find it difficult to reach. It is the **land of no retreat**.

Beneath the **Primordial Origin Assembly**, only the **Great Sage** and those of **auspicious karmic connection** may **pay homage and gaze upon** the Sovereign. When the **sutra was being expounded**, all celestial and human beings gathered, and through the **Jade Sovereign’s divine transformation and compassionate guidance**, they were **transported and united** to arrive here.

Thus, these celestial and human assemblies **unwittingly and without knowing how**, found themselves beneath the **Primordial Origin Assembly**. At that time, the **Celestial Sovereign** was none other than the **Primordial Origin Celestial Sovereign**. Some may assume these were the **various Heavenly Emperors**, but this is incorrect. At that moment, the **Primordial Origin** and the gathered assembly **witnessed all the Jade Sovereigns’ transformed bodies from the Ten Directions**, **universally assembled** before the **Grand Primordial Assembly**, **displayed without obstruction**, like an **infinite, boundless mirror of radiant light**, illuminating all forms and shadows, **mutually containing and embracing without hindrance**, **encompassing none in exclusion**.

At that time, the **Great Assembly** prostrated themselves fully, **bowing their heads to the ground**, gazing upward in reverence at the **Jade Sovereign’s divine transformation**—the **most exalted and sacred of all**. The Jade Sovereign is the **Sage Teacher of all Buddhas**, the **Lord of Ten Thousand Heavens**, hence the **most exalted**. This **augments pure, sincere faith**, **deepens resolute aspiration and joy**, **reaffirms commitment to the Dao and returns to the True**, **unwavering in resolve before it can be called sincere**, **truly rejoicing in the Great Dao before it can be called devotion**.

The assembly **beheld the Jade Sovereign’s wondrous transformation**, their hearts **delighted and sincerely submissive**, hence the **increased aspiration and joy**, their **whole hearts devoted in reliance**. There was **no thought of retreat, destruction, or deviation**; they **arose with the greatest firmness and unwavering sincerity**. A **retreating heart is not firm**; a **wandering heart is not steadfast**. Without firmness and steadfastness, there is **no pure faith, no resolute joy**. Only by **gazing upon the Jade Sovereign with no thought of retreat** does one **awaken the greatest unchanging, indestructible true resolve**, **eternally devoted to the Great Dao**.

**In my humble observation**: Human **qi and spirit** share the same source, yet their transformations differ. If the **heart does not align with the Dao**, even through **guiding and directing**, it remains **not the true path**. Thus, the **spirit does not condense**, the **numinous does not manifest**, and **mysterious transformations cannot emerge**.

If the **Primordial Spirit condenses into Truth**, **wondrously encompassing all existence**, allowing one to **silently pay homage to the True Emperor**, to **meet in the Mysterious Palace of the Spirit**, **True Suchness unfettered**, **requiring no contrivance**, then the **Jade Sovereign’s divine transformations**—the **Great Divine Pervasiveness**—**unmoving, guiding and uniting the celestial and human**, arrive at the **Primordial Origin’s Pure and Secret Assembly**.

When **qi and essence converge in mystical union**, **silently conforming to the Imperial Will**, **unaware and unknowing**, the **Primordial Spirit moves the numinous**, **illuminating all wondrous manifestations**, **without restriction or leakage**, then the **Great Assembly, unaware, ascends to the upper realms**. The **Primordial Origin** and the assembly **behold the Sovereign’s transformed bodies**, all gathered like **a great radiant mirror**, their lights **brilliantly illuminating**, their forms **mutually contained without obstruction**.

When **qi and essence merge with the spirit**, **uniting in secret to return to the True**, **without defilement or deceit**, **joyfully at ease**, **once obtained, eternally retained**, **never destroyed or lost**, then the **Great Assembly gazes upon the Jade Sovereign’s transformed body**, **knowing its most exalted nature**, **augments pure faith**, **deepens resolute joy**, **has no thought of retreat**, and **arises with the greatest firmness**.

**Students who deeply embody this** will **see its marvels**.

In the **Chapter on Divine Pervasiveness (Shéntōng)**, the **celestial and human beings** who drew near **suddenly attained heavenly birth**, **glimpsing the Celestial Sovereign’s supreme assembly**, the **Dao’s pure and first realm**, **adorned by the merit of non-action**, **leaping with joy**, they **paid homage in reverence**, exclaiming, **"Never before have we witnessed such a wondrous assembly!"**

At that time, the **Jade Sovereigns’ transformed bodies from the Ten Directions** **all returned to their singular form**, seated upon the **Law Seat**. The **pure assembly** at the **Law Feast** all wished to **hear the Jade Sovereign’s original conduct and realization**, yet **dared not ask**.

Zhang Guo remarked: **"When the Jade Sovereign’s transformed bodies universally gathered**, the **celestial and human beings** who drew near **received the Sovereign’s compassionate light**, their **spirits ascending to the Supreme Mysterious**, **attaining birth in the Pure and Secret Heaven**. Suddenly, they **beheld the Great Celestial Sovereign**, the **most supreme and auspicious assembly**, the **greatly beneficial Dao’s assembly**.

An **assembly** is merely where **common folk gather**; if the **benefits of the assembly are limited**, it cannot be called a **supreme assembly**. When the **Primordial Origin expounded the Jade Scripture**, the **Jade Sovereign displayed compassionate light**, and **all beings from the various Dharma Realms universally gathered**, **gods, ghosts, and mortals eternally benefiting from great advantage**. This **opened the great destiny of the Three Teachings**, **proclaimed the profound essence of Ten Thousand Laws**. It was the **most excellent and supreme Law Feast**. Across countless kalpas, no assembly could compare—**its merit was supreme, never to be destroyed or lost**, hence the **supreme assembly**.

At the assembly, the **Primordial Origin praised the Jade Sovereign’s virtue**, **transmitted the Law of Ultimate Truth**, the **supreme single vehicle**, **universally liberating all beings to awakening**, hence the **Dao’s assembly**. This **supreme assembly** was **utterly free of defilement**, **pure, subtle, and wondrously clear**—the **first and foremost in purity**. The **Jade Sovereign’s marvelous transformation** emerged **naturally**, **universally saving and eternally benefiting** through **profound, effortless function**. The **Sand Realm** was **enlightened by grace**, **eternally bathed in blessings across kalpas**.

The **Jade Sovereign never had intent**; the **Primordial Origin never took action**. The **Ten Thousand Heavens yielded their merit**; the **Buddhas relinquished their virtue**. Through **auspicious karmic connection and wondrous assembly**, the **transformative function shone universally**, **adorned by the merit of True Non-Action**. The **celestial and human**, witnessing this, **rejoiced beyond measure**, **truly unaware of dancing with hands or stamping with feet**, yet **leaping with joy**.

At that moment, the **Great Assembly prostrated themselves fully**, **paid homage**, declaring, **"Throughout countless kalpas, we have never witnessed such a wondrous supreme assembly!"**

At that time, the **Jade Sovereigns’ transformed bodies from the Ten Directions** **all returned to their singular form**, seated upon the **Great Radiant Law Seat**. The **pure assembly** at the **Law Feast**—those **riding the Sovereign’s light**, **ascending while ancient dust vanished**, **utterly free of defilement**—**witnessed the Jade Sovereign’s transformed body displayed across all great heavenly palaces and worlds**, **all illuminated by radiant light**.

At this moment, before the **Primordial Sovereign’s Assembly**, the **Jade Sovereigns** once more **assumed their singular form**, neither lacking in their divided transformations nor excessive in their unity—**suddenly dividing, suddenly gathering**, their divine mysteries **unfathomable**, their origins **unknown**.

With such **divine powers**, the **Fourfold Assembly** contemplated this and **all wished to hear** the **Jade Sovereign’s fundamental practice and cultivation**, the **path to attaining sainthood**—yet **none dared to presume and ask**.

**The humble scholar reflects:** Within a single human body, **qi** and **spirit** circulate and guard, **meridians and sinews** interweave and connect, **exterior and interior** mutually depend, **void and subtle** respond with marvelous efficacy, **movement and stillness** sustain each other. **One origin divides into myriad forms**, while **myriad forms return to one source**.

Yet **humans, bound by materiality and obscured by greed**, indulge in **delusive desires and false imaginings**, causing **clarity to dim** and **subtlety to stagnate**. Occasionally, **those who study the Dao to benefit the world** may **exhibit petty wisdom and private virtue**, **feigning merit and grace**—their kindness and benevolence **limited in extent**, how could they **truly embody the Dao**?

If one **begins well but ends poorly**, **commences virtuously yet fails to complete**, or **forcibly contrives divisions and handles**, though **seeming enlightened**, they **do not grasp the Dao’s profundity**. Those who **truly comprehend and awaken**, whose **illumination is universal and pure**, whose **stillness and response are both steadfast**—they **neither welcome nor reject with disturbance**; their **spirit flows naturally, silent and in accord**, without **laboring to push and turn**.

When the **Dao’s subtle mechanisms are preserved**, and **human hearts retreat to listen**, **turbulence clarifies**, **obstruction dissolves**, **true self-awakening is attained**, **joy arises effortlessly**, **free from bonds and veils**, **ever-renewing in wonder**—then **all heavenly beings and humans** are born into **heavenly realms**, **beholding the Celestial Worthy’s Assembly**, **pure and transcendent**, **effortless virtue manifesting in splendor**, and **leaping with delight to pay homage**, declaring, **"Never before have we seen this!"**

**Gathering myriad into one**, the **Celestial Sovereign ascends the throne**, and **thus the Jade Sovereigns of the Ten Directions return to their singular form**, seated upon the **Law Seat**.

If the **pure assembly** wishes to hear of the **Sovereign’s practice**, yet **none dare to question presumptuously**, then the **Sutra’s origins and roots** are **naturally revealed**—**not to be spoken of as one’s own**.

Those who **study the Dao** will **perceive its wonders** in secret.

**Chapter Sixteen: The Divine Powers**

Thus, the **Celestial Worthy** proclaimed to the **Fourfold Assembly**:

**"In the distant past, there was a realm** called **Light-Strict Mannerly Joy**. Its **king was named Pure Virtue** (*Jìngdé*).

At that time, the **king had a queen**, named **Treasure Moonlight**. The **king had no heir**, and one day, he **pondered thus**: *‘I may speak as “the Sovereign” (帝, *dì*), or as “I” (朕, *zhèn*). This is the king’s own speech. It cannot be “the Sovereign.” In past kalpas, I have never spoken as “I.” It must be “我” (I, *wǒ*). Now as I grow old, yet **no crown prince exists**. If my body **should perish or collapse**—*‘崩’* (*bēng*) means death, as when a mountain **shatters in great upheaval**—**to whom will the ancestral temples and the realm be entrusted?** The **temple of the soil god** (*shè*) and the **temple of the grain god** (*jì*)—**the state depends on its people**, and **people depend on the land and grain for sustenance**. The **soil and grain deities** are **of utmost importance**, hence when a king **rules the land**, he **must speak of the ancestral temples and the realm**.

**Every realm has a great ancestral temple** (*tàimìao*), where the **first ancestor**, the **second ancestor** (who transmits the direct lineage), the **third ancestor**, the **fourth ancestor**, the **great-great-grandfather**, the **highest ancestor**, the **great-grandfather**, and the **grandfather** are enshrined. The **first ancestor** stands in the center, with the **left ancestral halls** (*Zhāo*) and the **right ancestral halls** (*Mù*) arranged on either side, totaling **nine ancestral temples**. **Humans cherish their descendants**; how much more so a **king who rules the land**—**their fate is vastly different**.

Thus, the **king worried**: *‘If I have no heir, to whom will the ancestral temples be entrusted?’* After **such contemplation**, he **immediately issued an edict**, commanding the **Daoist assemblies and pure ones** in all **palaces and temples** to **follow the Dao’s teachings**, **recite the scriptures of expiation**, **hang the sacred banners and jewels**, **maintain purity and solemnity**, and **abundantly prepare offerings**. At **each of the six periods of the day**, they **burn incense and chant the Dao**, **visiting every temple**, praying to the **immortal sages and celestial worthies**. After **half a year**, the **king’s devotion grew yet more sincere**, **never wavering from his original resolve** to establish the **Dao Assembly** and pray for expiation.

**The humble scholar reflects:** **Human life** in this body **inherits the principles of Heaven and Earth**, **takes form from Heaven and Earth’s qi**, and **receives the essence of father and mother**. Thus, **this physical existence** is **endowed with vitality**. It **receives the luminous influence of sun and moon** as **clarity**, **depends on the king’s water and land** for **sustenance**, **follows the sage’s institutions** for **order and protection**, and **learns from enlightened teachers and friends** for **advancement and growth**.

With **the Dao**, one **stands in harmony with Heaven and Earth**, **nurtures all beings**, **enters sainthood and transcends mortality**, **free from the bonds of life and death**. Without **the Dao**, all **endeavors crumble**, **one’s name fades into obscurity**, **karma accumulates in error**, and **retribution never ceases**. **Ascending to sainthood**, one’s **body perishes yet essence remains**, **dwelling with the Dao eternally**—**even descendants continue**, **sacrifices never halt**. **As a mortal**, one **has no progeny**, **cutting off ancestral rites**.

The **difference between sainthood and mortality** is **so stark**."

The threshold between sainthood and mortality—how vast is the divide?

If one knows the weight of this body’s bonds, that life and death are fleeting yet grave, and does not squander this form, if one recognizes the fourfold debts of gratitude and the gravity of the five constants, if one fulfills one’s duties, clarifies the myriad things, cultivates with reverence, advances in learning to know, and remains steadfast and resolute—heeding virtue and acting upon it without delay—if one examines oneself day and night, preserving integrity from start to finish, unashamed even before the scrutiny of heaven, and never faltering in sincerity, then one aligns with Heaven and Earth in virtue, with the sun and moon in luminosity, with the four seasons in order, and with spirits in fortune and misfortune. Thus, one awaits sainthood without doubt, never slacking for an instant, living in harmony and dying in peace, returning to the primordial transformation, leaving behind a legacy that grows ever brighter—even as the Light-Strong King’s Confession, whose devotion never wavered.

**Chapter Seventeen: Divine Manifestations**

Suddenly, in a single night, the Queen of Precious Moonlight dreamed of the Most High Dao Lord and the assembled Perfect Ones, their forms radiant as gold, their voices pure as jade, their essence untainted and luminous. They rode upon a five-colored dragon carriage, surrounded by banners of dazzling splendor, their seals and flags casting protective shadows. A canopy of resplendent clouds enveloped them.

At that time, the Most High Dao Lord sat serenely upon the dragon carriage, cradling an infant. The child’s every pore emitted a hundred billion rays of light, illuminating the royal palaces in hues of priceless treasures, with banners and flags leading the way as they floated through the void.

Seeing this, the Queen’s heart filled with joy. She knelt in reverence before the Dao Lord and humbly petitioned: *"My lord, the king has no heir. I pray you grant this child to be the sovereign of our realm. May your boundless compassion hear my plea and bestow this child upon me."*

The Dao Lord replied: *"I grant this child to you."*

The Queen bowed in gratitude and took the child. Upon waking, she found herself with child. After a year, on the ninth day of the first month in the Year of the Fire Horse, at noon, a son was born in the royal palace.

The Venerable Lord Guangsheng declared: *"The Light-Strong King’s prayer for an heir was answered—his resolve never faltered."*

---

Suddenly, in one night, the Queen of Precious Moonlight dreamed of the Most High Lord of Supreme Treasure Dao and the assembled Perfect Saints, their forms gleaming with golden radiance, their bodies smooth as jade, their divine light pure and unblemished. They rode upon a five-colored dragon-borne palanquin, attended by banners of radiant splendor and flags of dazzling glory, their seals casting protective shadows beneath a canopy of luminous cloud-mist.

At that time, the Most High Dao Lord sat composedly within the five-colored dragon carriage, holding a divine infant. From every pore of the child’s body, a hundred billion wondrous lights emanated, illuminating the royal halls in the splendor of a hundred treasures. Banners and flags led the way, floating through the void.

Seeing the Dao Lord holding the divine child, the Queen’s heart filled with delight. She knelt in reverence and respectfully addressed the Dao Lord: *"My lord, the king has no heir. I humbly beseech you to grant this holy child as the sovereign of our land. May your great compassion pity the king’s childlessness and grant my request, bestowing this child upon me."*

The Dao Lord answered the Queen: *"I specially grant this child to you."*

The Queen then paid her respects and thanked the Dao Lord before receiving the child. Upon waking from the dream, she found herself with child. After a year of pregnancy, on the ninth day of the first month in the Year of the Fire Horse, at noon, a son was born in the palace of the Light-Strong King of Wondrous Joy.

**A Note from the Unworthy:**
Mankind’s birth is endowed with essence and form, with the principles of duty and life. The body bears the weight of the cosmic order, and life carries the dual responsibility of heaven and earth. Noble and luminous, it is both spiritually enlightened and free. Yet the body is not mere flesh, nor is life a trivial matter.

By nature, one is of golden essence and jade-like form, pure and unstained. But if one remains in darkness, indulges in delusion, and scorns this precious gift, unable to grasp the divine mystery, to nurture the sacred embryo, then one squanders the family’s most precious treasure—this very body—rendering it useless. Even if one has some self-regard, if one does not comprehend the Dao, if one’s practice is insincere, feigning virtue while indulging in vice, then though one may appear golden without, one is but rotting rags within.

Thus, one’s very self cannot be preserved, and though endowed with noble heavenly rank, one’s virtues remain unmanifest. How then can one fulfill one’s form and perfect one’s nature, ensuring that this true master does not decline?

If one awakens to the profound roots of life and death, aligns with the secrets of heaven and man, penetrates the mysteries of yin and yang, and delves deeply into the workings of creation—if one recognizes one’s ancestral roots, acknowledges one’s parents, sees that which gave birth to one rooted in the receptive, and understands that which nurtured one rooted in the creative—if one refines the golden essence, purifies the jade-like form, attains wonder in the boundless, and comprehends the mysterious in the void, then with the spirit of emptiness one may conceive the truth of marvelous existence, forming a sacred embryo and giving birth to a saintly child. Thus, those who gave birth to one do not labor in vain, and those who nurtured one are not forgotten. With bones of gold and flesh of jade, one transcends form and spirit, withering yet reborn, enduring without end—even as the Queen of Precious Moonlight dreamed of the Most High Dao Lord and the Pure Ones, receiving the holy child as the sovereign of the realm.

Mankind is one. Awakening brings divinity; ignorance brings ruin. To perceive the Queen of Precious Moonlight’s prayer for a child is to awaken to the Dao.

**Chapter Eighteen: Divine Manifestations**

At the time of his birth, his body radiated a dazzling light, filling the kingdom with its brilliance. His appearance was exquisite beyond measure, and all who beheld him found no satisfaction in gazing upon him.

From infancy, he was quick-witted and wise; as he grew, he became compassionate and benevolent. Within his realm, he distributed all treasures and wealth from the royal stores, relieving the destitute, the widowed, the orphaned, the aged, the sick, the hungry, and all suffering beings.

**Chapter Eighteen: Divine Manifestations**

With virtue, love, and humility, songs of the Dao resounded; his influence reached the distant lands, and all under heaven revered and followed him, submitting to the **Daoist** Prince of Virtue. The **Highest Dao Lord** rejoiced in his father’s descent.

When the Jade Emperor was born, his body emitted a radiant light of precious treasures, illuminating the **Pure and Radiant Realm** of the Light-Strength Kingdom. His form and appearance were wondrously beautiful, and those who gazed upon him never tired of beholding him.

In his tender youth, he was keen and wise; as he matured, he became compassionate, merciful, and virtuous. Within his own kingdom, from the imperial treasuries and granaries, he freely dispersed all riches and wealth—whether in abundance or measure, without hesitation or stinginess—until all were exhausted, as if scattering them without restraint.

Yet if one were to hoard wealth for oneself, it would mean neglecting one’s sovereign, one’s kin, and one’s state. The Jade Emperor, born with divine knowledge, was the **Most Exalted Sage** of perfect conduct—how could he commit such excess?

The imperial treasuries were not bestowed upon those who already possessed fortune. Instead, they went to the penniless and destitute, those trapped in despair or peril, the widowed husband, the widow, the orphaned child, the childless elder, those without mother or father to lean upon, and in years of famine when grain was scarce or vegetables unripe. To those afflicted with illness, decay, injury, or deformity—all beings in hardship—he granted relief and aid, his virtue flowing from the sincerest depths, not merely as outward show.

With boundless kindness and compassion, gentle and modest, his blessings extended across the land, his virtue praised in song. From the borderlands to the distant wilderness, his influence spread, and all under heaven looked to him in reverence, submitting to the **Daoist** Prince of Virtue.

*"Submit"* means to join with him. The *Analects* says: *"If one day you practice self-restraint and return to the Dao, all under heaven will submit to virtue."* Indeed, seeking the Dao brings swift attainment, and its effects are vast.

The Jade Emperor was born with divine marvels, and as he grew, his boundless compassion and virtue made all under heaven submit to him. His father rejoiced all the more.

**Chapter Nineteen: Divine Manifestations**

Later, the king suddenly passed away. The **Daoist** Prince, now ruler, cast his gaze upon the transient nature of life—*"floating life"*, for human existence is like a cloud in the sky or a floating leaf on water, fleeting and unable to endure. He issued decrees to his ministers, declaring that the throne should be passed to one who followed the Dao.

Thus, he abandoned his kingdom and retreated to the **Universal Clarity Fragrant Mountain** to cultivate the **Great Dao**. His merit was fulfilled, and he transcended the mundane world, ascending to the heavens.

The **Fighting Mother** said: When the **Daoist** Prince of Virtue ruled the **Wondrous Joy Kingdom**, and all under heaven submitted to virtue, the king suddenly died.

The **Daoist** Prince took the throne, governing the affairs of his kingdom. He cast his gaze upon the transient nature of life—*"floating life"*, for human existence is like a cloud in the sky or a floating leaf on water, fleeting and unable to endure. Having reflected thus, he commanded his ministers, declaring that the imperial treasure should be passed to one who followed the Dao and practiced goodness.

Or it may be said: He entrusted the throne to his ministers, who were to inherit it by following the Dao and doing good. The intent remains the same.

Having entrusted the throne to the virtuous, he abandoned his kingdom and concealed himself within the **Universal Clarity Fragrant Mountain**, cultivating the **Great Dao**. The **Universal Clarity Fragrant Mountain**, according to ancient records, is the **Stonehead Mountain** of the Eastern Sea. The other mountains where the Jade Emperor left traces and expounded teachings are not the same as this Fragrant Mountain.

Once the **Daoist** Prince entered the mountain to cultivate, his merit was fulfilled, and he transcended the mundane world, ascending to the heavens.

---

The **Daoist** Prince, though born as a mortal, possessed the **True Vital Qi** of life. With this **True Qi**, one may become human. This **True Qi**, when in the heavens and earth, is the **Wondrous Principle**; when in the body, it is the **Boundless Virtue**.

The **True Qi** is profound and luminous, its light self-arising, illuminating past and present, encompassing all of **Dharma-Realm**. If one fully embodies this principle, one need not suffer hardship or peril, nor face the world’s revulsion. Yet if one abandons it in the heavens, neglects it in the body, and fails to preserve the **True Nature of Inherited Virtue**, one cannot nurture the **True Qi** to give birth to **Divine Transformation**, nor refine the **Mysterious Mechanism** to achieve **Spiritual Manifestation**. Instead, one remains obscured and dim, filled with resentment and jealousy, greedy for gain and fame, hoarding without end, unconcerned with **Daoist Morality**, unmoved by the suffering of the poor, arrogant and self-praised, inviting slander and defamation. This is to harm the **True Qi**, weaken the **Boundless Virtue**, and sink oneself into the realm of the common and ignorant, unable to attain sainthood.

If, however, one preserves the **Great Harmony**, concentrates the **Secret Intent**, and the **Sage Embryo** radiates **Precious Light**, the **Divine Infant** emits **Wondrous Scenery**, gradually unfolding **Profound Deities**, with **Spiritual Manifestation** unimpeded—if one regards **worldly power and advantage** as mud and **honors and glory** as dust, using one’s abundance to aid others’ lack, benefiting all beings and extending mercy universally, accepting the rise and fall of one’s fate without ceasing—then one’s **merit and virtue** are boundless. One’s **Great Virtue and Divine Transformation** endure forever, earning the name of **Daoist Sage**, and all of **Dharma-Realm** is bathed in compassion.

The gods rejoice, and mortals are pleased, offering service to the **Most Exalted Virtue**. Thus, the child of the heavens and earth appears in the world as a wondrous being, and even his parents are honored and delighted.

This is the divine marvel of the Jade Emperor’s birth.

As he grew, his compassion and virtue were boundless, and all under heaven submitted to him. His father rejoiced all the more.

---

How rare it is to find those who honor noble birth, yet how common the plight of poverty! Moreover, men are but drunken in dreams, lost in delusion and unaware.

Thus, those who practice the **Dao** are scarcely heard of—how much rarer still to become an **Immortal**!

Yet if one awakens to the truth that life is but a transient sojourn, as fleeting as the mayfly, and breaks free from the dust of mundane concerns, earnestly seeking the **Supreme Mystery**, penetrating its depths with clarity and resolve—without seeking swift results, yet knowing that when the time comes, transformation will unfold naturally—then one’s path will bear the name of **Immortal**.

Though ancestors may pass, their legacy endures through the **Most Exalted Sage’s** arrival in **Luó**, ensuring they are not forgotten.

Was it not the **Wondrous Bliss Prince**, abandoning his royal station to cultivate the **Dao**, who attained transcendence and delivered others?

Ah! The human body is like **Kunlun Mountain**—when the **Old Yang** is exhausted, a single **Yang** is reborn, transcending all boundaries. Through secret cultivation of the **True Essence**, time brings **Immortal Transformation**. Even the faintest aspiration toward **Immortalhood** mirrors the **Emperor’s** path.

This must be savored deeply.

**Chapter on Divine Powers (Twenty Sections)**

After this **kalpa** had passed, spanning eight hundred **kalpas**, he repeatedly abandoned his kingdom for the sake of all beings, severing familial bonds to study the **Dao**.

Following these **kalpas**, he spent another eight hundred practicing medicinal alchemy to heal the sick, rescuing suffering beings and granting them peace.

When this **kalpa** ended, he spent another eight hundred **kalpas** employing vast **skillful means**, unveiling the **Daoist Canons**, reciting **Sacred Scriptures**, and propagating the **True Teaching** to its fullest extent, displaying **Divine Virtue** and aiding both state and people—from the hidden to the manifest.

After these **kalpas**, he endured another eight hundred, sacrificing his body and life without hesitation, enduring humiliation and insult, offering his own flesh and blood in **Patience and Tolerance**.

Thus, through **ascetic practice** spanning **three thousand two hundred kalpas**, he attained the rank of **Golden Immortal**, named **Pure and Natural Awakened Ruler of **Dharma****, teaching all **Bodhisattvas** the sudden enlightenment of the **Great Vehicle’s True Doctrine**, gradually entering the **Mysterious and Void Supreme Dao**.

After further cultivation spanning **ten million kalpas**, he attained the rank of **Jade Emperor**.

When these words were spoken, the **Pure Assembly** of **Dharma** in unison exclaimed in wonder, for such **Sagely Virtue** had never been heard before.

**True Lord** spoke: *"In the **Jade Emperor’s** early life, after ascending the royal throne to cultivate, once these **kalpas** had passed, he spent another eight hundred as a prince. Each time he assumed the throne, it was for the sake of guiding and transforming beings, severing all ties of kinship to study the **True Dao**."*

**Kalpas** vary in scale—sixty years constitute a **Dust-Kalpa**, five hundred years a **Pure and Auspicious Assembly-Kalpa**, three thousand years a **Leap-Kalpa**; eighteen thousand years mark a **Small Kalpa**, while one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred years define a **Wheel-Kalpa**. When these accumulate into myriad **kalpas**, they form a **Great Kalpa**.

Though eight hundred **kalpas** may encompass both small and great, the emphasis lies in their enduring duration—roughly eight hundred **kalpas** in number.

After severing attachments to study the **Dao**, he spent another eight hundred **kalpas** administering medicinal elixirs, healing ailments, and rescuing suffering beings, granting them prosperity and joy.

When these **kalpas** concluded, he spent another eight hundred employing vast **skillful means**, unveiling the **Daoist Canon’s** sacred texts, reciting **Profound and Sacred Scriptures**, expanding the **True and Great Teaching**, and disseminating **Divine Scripture’s** virtues—assisting the state and saving the people, from the obscure to the luminous.

Some say *"from the hidden to the manifest"*—from the **Dark Realm** to the **Bright World**, encompassing all beneath heaven and earth.

This meaning is also coherent.

After these **kalpas**, he endured another eight hundred, sacrificing his life without regret, enduring humiliation and insult, offering his own flesh and blood—yet taking others’ wealth as if it were his own, for men’s gifts are like the sacrifice of blood and flesh.

In a past **kalpa**, the **Jade Emperor** endured humiliation, accepting others’ wealth even in dire poverty and suffering, when insults were heaped upon him. Though others could not bear such hardship, he felt no retreat or remorse—this was his **Sacrifice of Body and Life**, his **Patience and Tolerance**, his offering of **flesh and blood**.

Losing one’s parents is a trial even the common man finds unbearable, yet this was necessary to achieve what others could not.

Having attained **Supreme Sageship**, the **Emperor’s** act of accepting **flesh and blood** was also inevitable.

Yet the **Sage** transforms and guides the ignorant—nothing is beyond his capacity. Through **Divine Manifestations** and **Mysterious Transformations**, his true form remains unharmed.

Let the discerning understand the **Divine Harmony**; do not be bound by mere words.

From the eight hundred **kalpas** of severing attachments to study the **Dao**, through healing with medicine, teaching scriptures to deliver beings, and enduring humiliation while accepting offerings—such **ascetic practices** and **mysterious deeds** spanned **three thousand two hundred kalpas** before he attained the rank of **Golden Immortal**, bearing the fruit of **Unspoiled Perfection**, named **Pure and Natural Mysterious Awakened **Dharma** King**, teaching all **Bodhisattvas** and **Great **Sages** the sudden enlightenment of the **Great Vehicle’s True Doctrine**, gradually entering the **Void, Profound, True, and Mysterious Supreme Dao**.

The term **"Thus-Come-One"** signifies that all beings possess **Nature**—endowed with ten thousand virtues. Yet those who abandon this **Nature** fail to preserve heaven’s bestowal, their **True Suchness** obscured to the extreme, and they fall into mundane deeds.

Before his cultivation, the **Jade Emperor** abandoned the **Wondrous Bliss** royal station and spent another **three thousand two hundred kalpas**, his **virtues and transformations** boundless, never retreating, unattached and unstained, the **Great Awakened **Dharma** King**, encompassing heaven and earth, shaping all things—yet leaving none behind. Those who restore their **body and **Nature** to wholeness surpass even this by ten thousandfold; such is the **"Thus-Come-One."**

After such **great cultivation**, another ten million **kalpas** passed before he attained the rank of **Jade Emperor**, **Teacher of Ten Thousand **Heavens**.

When **Primordial Heavenly Venerable** spoke these words, the **Pure Assembly** of **Dharma** in unison exclaimed in wonder, for such **Sagely Virtue** had never been witnessed before.

**Reflection:** Man’s life is governed by **Yin** and **Yang**, his thoughts by **Principle** and **Desire**.

**Yin** and **Yang** are interdependent, alternately waxing and waning;
**Principle** and **Desire** cannot coexist—when **Desire** stirs, **Yin** congeals; when **Principle** is pure, **Yang** flourishes.
Flourishing and reaching **Transformation**, one enters the **Divine and Mysterious**.

What is placed is universally fitting, yet nothing is applied without effect.
The **Pure Yang** is the supreme virtue, yet the indolent cannot attain it.

The **Jade Emperor**, moved by pity, expounded profound truths, abandoning his royal throne without hesitation. Through eight hundred **kalpas**, he renounced his realm, severed ties of affection, and studied the **Great Dao**—this **mysterious conduct** is boundless and supreme.

Moreover, the **Original Spirit** governs the **Soul’s Pavilion**, commands the five senses, and directs all ministers.
Among the six **desires** and seven **emotions**, affection is the heaviest.
To exhaust **desire** and return to **Principle**, to subdue **emotions** and restore **Nature**, to strip away all superficial adornments and alone grasp the **Mysterious and Secret**—this is also the **Celestial Sovereign’s** abandonment of his throne to seek the **Way**.

He administered **elixirs** to save lives, ensuring their peace and comfort.
The **Jade Emperor** again traversed eight hundred **kalpas** to benefit the world.

Man’s **earthly toil** and **fantasies** blind him to true intent, leading him to old age and death without enlightenment—this is the world’s greatest affliction.
To refine the **Original Spirit**, **Essential Qi**, and the three grades of **elixir**, condensing them into **Secret Essence**, restoring **Yang** and transforming bones, living without deception and dying without loss—this is also the **inner alchemy** of saving lives through **elixirs**.

He expounded **sutras** to aid the realm, benefiting both the living and the dead.
The **Emperor** again traversed eight hundred **kalpas**.

When man attains the **Mysterious** and penetrates the **Secret**, transforming **Yin** and **Yang** with marvelous skill, ascending to the **Highest Immortal**, rescuing ghosts and spirits—his body also embodies the silent transmission of **True Scriptures** to benefit the **Dark and Bright**.

He abandoned his life, discarded flesh and blood.
The **Emperor** again traversed eight hundred **kalpas**.

When man’s heart remains undisturbed, casting off impurity, his body also embodies the **sacrifice of life**, enduring suffering, and abandoning flesh and blood.

From **kalpa** to **kalpa**, with devout cultivation unchanging, pure and unstained, his transformations arise naturally, enabling all to awaken—his merit is boundless.
Thus, as the **Jade Emperor** cultivated from over three thousand **kalpas** to a hundred million, such **unparalleled marvels** are rare indeed.

**Chapter Twenty-One: Divine Abilities**

At that moment, among the assembly, a **Jade Maiden** named **Yèguāng** rose from her seat.
She adjusted her robes and crown with solemn grace, knelt long before the **Dao**, and addressed the **Heavenly Venerable**:

*"Your servant, in past lives, through what merit did I attain the honor of serving at Your presence, personally offering reverence and supply for countless **kalpas**?
The **Three Pure** realms—**Golden Gates** and **Jade Capital**—are serene, tranquil, and unbounded, filled with joy and ease. I have wandered the **Holy Domain**, savoring the **Sound of Law** like relishing flavors, yet never before witnessed such **rare and wondrous** deeds.

**Ghost Valley Master** said:
When the pure assembly marveled at the **Jade Emperor’s** words, I stood among the attendants. A **Jade Maiden**, named **Yèguāng**, arose from her seat, her robes and crown perfectly adorned.
Though her attire was already pure and solemn, rising only heightened her dignity—thus, ‘adjusted her robes and crown with solemn grace.’

She moved with measured steps, kneeling long before the **Dao Ancestor**, and respectfully reported to the **Primordial Heavenly Venerable**:
‘Your servant, **Yèguāng**, in past lives, through what cause did I attain the fortune of gazing upon and serving in the presence of the **Celestial Sovereign**?’

Some might say **Yèguāng** refers to the **Jade Light** of the **Three Pure** realms, or question the origin of the **Jade Emperor’s** radiance, assuming it was the **Primordial’s** attendant.
This is incorrect.
The **Celestial Emperor** often attended the **Three Pure** realms during sermons, yet his **Jade Light** was not always visible.
Thus, the **Jade Maiden** spoke as such—there is no doubt she was the **Celestial Emperor’s** attendant.

Your servant has served at Your presence not once, personally offering reverent supply for **a hundred million kalpas**.
The **Three Pure** mystical realms—**Golden Gates**, **Jade Capital**—are silent, pure, and effortless, filled with unbounded joy and supreme ease. I have delighted in divine wanderings, nourishing my senses with the **Sound of Law**.

‘Savoring the **Sound of Law**’—the **True Secrets** of the **Pure and Lofty** are the highest **Dharma**, with inexhaustible flavors, not easily perceived.
Though the **Jade Maiden** was divine, she was still a **saintly stream** being—how could she fully comprehend?
Thus, she listened to the **Law’s sound** and pondered its depths, as one who swallows fine food and savors its taste.

This refers to her past reflections, not today’s hearing of the **Primordial’s** words.
If interpreted as today’s event, it misses the original intent.

**Yèguāng**, dwelling in the **Holy Realm** for ages, long serving at Your presence, found great delight.
Listening to the **Law’s sound**, she witnessed all marvels without fail, understanding them all—
as the **Jade Emperor** universally radiated compassion, transforming and receiving beings at will, gathering and dispersing effortlessly, generating auspicious wonders, cultivating **True Essence** through **kalpas**, his merit boundless, guiding **saintly streams** to supreme awakening.

Through countless **kalpas**, she observed and discerned past ages, yet never before witnessed such **wondrous and unheard-of** deeds.

**Reflection:** A woman’s **Yin-qi** is no different from an **Immortal Maiden**.
Her **jade-like bones** and **ice-cold spirit** naturally possess grace and elegance.
Yet, stained by dust and defilement, obscured by long-standing filth, her **Yin-Dharma essence** sinks into impure thoughts and evil deeds;
her **Six Ding-Yin spirits** become restless **hungry ghosts**.
Her thoughts are endless, her days filled with restless striving—
her meals and rest are never settled.
Her movements are frantic, unable to ascend to **Heaven**, to serve the **Mysterious Origin**.

She indulges in reckless desires, craving luxuries and fame, binding herself with vanity, burdening herself with **earthly toil**, unable to attain ease and joy.
She follows the **Wheel of Rebirth**, descending into the **mundane world** without end.
She does not hear the **True Dao** or **Mysterious Law**, daily indulging in **desires**, constantly assailed by **demons**, with no chance of **transformation**.
If **Pure Yang** secretly transforms, nurturing **Yin-essence** into **truth**—
her **pale moon** radiates boundless brilliance, her **jade body** reveals divine **transformation** without end;
her entire being becomes supremely **numinous**,
her **transformative essence** flows effortlessly, her **mysterious essence** gleams pure.
She bows in silence to the **Primordial**, worshipping the **Celestial Emperor** in stillness.
Her **Nature and Dao** are ever-clear, her heart obeys the command."

The realm of the **Crimson Terrace** and **Purple Palace**,
the palace of the **Seven Treasures** and **Five Enlightenments**,
is **serene and luminously empty**, where **effortless joy** prevails.
There, the **Divine** wanders through **mysterious domains**,
tasting the **resonant sounds of celestial jade**—
a sight of **rare wonders** in the world,
a **true supreme delight** beyond compare.

Then the **Radiant-Night Jade Maiden** arose from her seat,
adjusted her **garments and crown**,
and with **refined steps** knelt before the **Dao/Way**,
addressing the **Heavenly Sovereign**,
inquiring about her **ancient causes**,
and requesting the **Heavenly Emperor’s** **Mysterious Transformation**—
a **rare and wondrous** matter indeed.

For **Yin and Yang**, the **principle** and **Qi**,
are what all humans share.
Those who attain the **Dao** manifest **Yin-essence** as the **Jade Maiden’s** **Divine Communication**,
while those without the **Dao** descend into **darkly mundane states**,
so the **True Practice** must be made clear.

**Divine Communication** consists of **twenty-two chapters**:
*"The Radiant-Night Jade Maiden* did not discern how within the **Great Light**,
the **Ten Directions of All Heavens** appeared,
transforming into **Sacred Domains**,
where the **Heavenly Emperor’s** **Mysterious Responsive** **Divine Transformation** **Law-Body** manifested,
along with **Heavenly Sovereigns**, **Great Saints**, **Mysterious Virtue Immortals**, and **Jade Consorts** as their **attendants**.
These **Jade Maidens** possessed **lofty and dignified** appearances,
**exquisite and refined** forms,
and emitted **unparalleled divine fragrance**—
none could compare to them.

Further, the **Heavenly Emperor’s** **Divine Communication** **Mysteriously Transferred** them,
and now they all gather in the **Qingwei Heaven**—
a **pure and subtle celestial realm**.

The *Radiant-Night Jade Maiden* did not yet comprehend
how these **attendants**—the **Jade Maidens**—
by what **wondrous cause and fortunate karmic connection**,
attained such **supreme and matchless** **forms of beauty**?

For **supreme forms of beauty**—
the **Jade Maidens’** **Mysterious Transformation** **forms**—
transcend all others, with none to rival them.
In this world, there are the **Six Paths**,
among which the **Three Evil Paths**—**Hell**, **Hungry Ghosts**, and **Beastly Existence**—
lack any **beauty of form**.

The **human form**, born from the **confluence of vital essence and blood**,
scatters **Qi** and loses **Spirit**—
its filth is beyond description.
And even when alive,
it faces **decline and aging**, **illness and suffering**,
so all beauty is but a **fleeting dream**.

Thus, the **body is called an illusion**—
how could it be **supreme beauty**?

Beyond these, the **demonic maidens** of all **demonic paths**,
though their **appearances** are strange and wondrous,
and they possess the **Five Supernormal Powers**,
can **transform** and fulfill their **retributive karmic debts**,
yet they remain **self-inflicted calamities**.
How could they be called **supreme beauty**?

Only these **Jade Consorts** and **Jade Maidens**—
their **strange and peerless** **forms and refined virtues**—
surpass the **Three Realms**,
their **celestial fragrance** **Mysteriously Transformed**,
neither **waning nor mundane**,
unseen by the **worldly**—
these are the **supreme beauty**,
which the *Radiant-Night Jade Maiden* still could not fathom.

Thus, the **Heavenly Sovereign’s** **Supreme Compassion** revealed to her what she had not yet understood:
the **Jade Consorts’** **forms and divine fragrance**,
and the **principle** of their **exquisite and refined** **bodies**.

The humble one reflects:
*"All worldly blessings and karmic deeds*
arise from the **heart’s** creation.
The **heart** governs **Nature and Virtue**,
and **Nature** possesses nothing it does not contain.
The **Mysterious Transformation** of **Yin and Yang**—
everyone inherently possesses it.
Without **Daoic cultivation**,
one aligns with **Yin** and falls into **darkly mundane states**,
becoming a **rotting corpse and decaying bones**—
the **root of cyclic rebirth**.

But when one **awakens to the Dao** and **cultivates True Practice**,
then **Yin** is also the **body’s** **upright Qi**,
and the **Six Celestial Powers** reveal their **wondrous essence**,
illuminating **Heaven’s Light** in stillness.
The **Jade Maiden’s** **True Fragrance** is the **exquisite manifestation** of her **body**.

Her **entire being** is **pervasively numinous**,
ascending to the **Crimson Terrace’s** **Jade Towers**,
the **Six Yang’s** **Secret Domain**,
where the **True King** **reigns in due season**.
Her **Law-Body** **broadly transforms**,
commanding **Tigers** and **Dragon** **Spirits**;
she **refines the Jade Fluid** in the **Mysterious Palace**,
and the **Jade Consorts** **stand at her right side**;
she gathers the **Secret Treasures** of **Dan Elixir**,
and the **fragrance of the Celestial Maidens** drifts pure.

This is also how the **Heavenly Emperor’s Light** manifests the **Ten Directions of Heavenly Domains**.
There are the **Heavenly Emperor’s Responsive Law-Bodies**,
the **Jade Maidens** as **attendants**,
**Mysteriously Transferred** by **Divine Communication** to dwell in the **Qingwei Heaven**.

For all humans possess **Nature**,
containing **Yin and Yang**,
embracing **all wondrous essences**—
their **bodies** align with **Heaven’s**.
The **Jade Consorts’** **Divine Communication** and **wondrous range**—
those who hear of them all understand,
yet why did the *Radiant-Night Jade Maiden*, now **saintly and attending the Emperor**,
still fail to grasp it?

For **cultivation and attainment** have **ranked distinctions** of **high and low**,
and the **saintly body** arises from the **Dao’s** **Mysterious Transformation**.
Whatever **fruit** one attains,
one’s **Divine Communication** will match—
only **saints** know **saints**, only **virtuous ones** know **virtuous ones**—
not a **single particle** can be falsely borrowed.

The **Jade Consorts** and **Jade Maidens**, by their **Heavenly True Essence**,
**Divinely Transform** to save people—
thus their **radiant and numinous** **forms**,
and their **pure and wondrous** **fragrance**,
are beyond the *Radiant-Night Jade Maiden’s* understanding.

Her ignorance stems not from **retreat or concealment**,
but from the **initial stages** of her **saintly body**,
and the **difference in rank**—
she had not yet reached their level.

Alas, even the **Jade Consorts** are difficult to comprehend—
how could the **Heavenly Emperor’s Light** and **Divine Transformation** be measured?

The *Radiant-Night Jade Maiden* could not yet know—
how could others?

**Heavenly and mundane beings share one Nature**,
and humans stand **equal in rank** to the **Heavenly Emperor**.
Yet even to **know** this is beyond them—
how could they attain **sainthood**?

People should **reflect upon it** and **strive earnestly**.

**Chapter Twenty-Three of Divine Communication**:
At that time, the **Heavenly Sovereign** spoke to the *Radiant-Night Jade Maiden*:
"You have indeed **entered the stream of sainthood**,
though possessing **wisdom**, you still cannot **fully comprehend** it.

These **Jade Maidens**—
from **countless eons past**—
**cultivated all wondrous virtues**,
**mastered the gates of liberation**,
and shared **pure faith**, **pure understanding**, **pure contemplation**,
**pure conduct**, **pure body**, **pure heart**, **pure intention**,
and **pure fruit and retribution**.

They shared **Great Compassion** and **Great Mercy**,
protecting all **sentient beings** like a **mother tenderly cradling her children**,
and **loving them as her own flesh**.

The **Heavenly Sovereign** spoke to the *Radiant-Night Jade Maiden*:

*"You have devotedly upheld the **precepts**, your mind immersed in the **Great Dao**,
and with **pure fasting** and **grand vows**, for countless eons you have revered the **Jade Emperor**."*

The **Vacuous-Emptiness Emperor** declared:
*"When you, *Radiant-Night*, sought **saintly blessings** and your **unawakened mind** was opened,
the **Primordial Heavenly Sovereign** spoke to the *Jade Maiden*:
'You have indeed **entered the stream of sainthood**.
You—**you**—are now aligned with the **saints**, becoming one with their **flow and kind**.
Since you are **saintly**, you should know **all things**.
Yet as one who has **only just entered the stream of sainthood**,
though you possess **acute wisdom and keen insight**,
you still cannot **fully penetrate and comprehend** it.

These **attendants of the Jade Emperor**—
they did not **suddenly attain** such **divine powers**.
From **past eons beyond measure**, they **cultivated all wondrous virtues**,
**fully mastering the gates of great awakening and liberation**,
**untainted through eons**, their **orthodox faith** never wavering.
The Jade Emperor, **from ancient times**, has always held **pure faith**.
The *Jade Maidens*’ **wondrous practices** across eons also share this **pure faith**.
They **transcend sensory forms**, achieving **great liberation**.
The Jade Emperor, **from ancient times**, has always held **pure understanding**.
The *Jade Maidens*’ **wondrous practices** across eons also share this **pure understanding**.
Their **true contemplation** is **beyond birth**, severing all **realms of existence**.
The Jade Emperor, **from ancient times**, has always held **pure contemplation**.
The *Jade Maidens*’ **wondrous practices** across eons also share this **pure contemplation**.
Their **wondrous conduct** is **sublime and unblemished**, forever without fault.
The Jade Emperor, **from ancient times**, has always held **pure conduct**.
The *Jade Maidens*’ **wondrous practices** across eons also share this **pure conduct**.
Their **Dao-body** is **untainted by defilement**.
The Jade Emperor, **from ancient times**, has always held **pure body**.
The *Jade Maidens*’ **wondrous practices** across eons also share this **pure body**.
Their **heart is the Dao**, their **Dao is the heart**—**serene and unobstructed**.
The Jade Emperor, **from ancient times**, has always held **pure heart**.
The *Jade Maidens*’ **wondrous practices** across eons also share this **pure heart**.
They **transcend inner and outer**, **abandoning all contrivance and artifice**.
The Jade Emperor, **from ancient times**, has always held **pure intention**.
The *Jade Maidens*’ **wondrous practices** across eons also share this **pure intention**.
They **dwell in the Upper Clarity**, never regressing.
The Jade Emperor, having **attained sainthood**, has achieved **pure fruit**.
The *Jade Maidens*’ **wondrous practices** across eons also share this **pure fruit**.
Through **vast eons**, their **merits are immeasurable**.
The Jade Emperor, **Most Exalted**, has achieved **pure retribution**.
The *Jade Maidens*’ **wondrous practices** across eons also share this **pure retribution**.
Their **compassion extends to the sands of the world**, their **benevolence permeates eons**.
The Jade Emperor possesses **Great Compassion**.
The *Jade Maidens*’ **wondrous practices** also share this **Great Compassion**.
They **compassionately regard all beings**, sparing none.
The Jade Emperor possesses **Great Mercy**.
The *Jade Maidens*’ **wondrous practices** also share this **Great Mercy**.
The *Jade Maidens*’ **Great Compassion and Mercy** align with the Jade Emperor’s.
How so?
They **shelter and protect all sentient beings**,
like a **loving mother tenderly nurturing her cherished infant**,
with **sincere, boundless affection**.
Moreover, they **uphold the Mystic Precepts** with **unwavering devotion**.
Some say:
*'With **reverent-hearted** and **strictly disciplined** minds,
**concentrated and undivided**, they thus **immerse their hearts** in the **Great Dao**.*
This meaning is even more profound.

The *Jade Maidens*’ **return to the Great Dao** is not fleeting;
they are **pure, devout, and expansive in their grand vows**,
revering and respecting the Jade Emperor through countless eons.

**My reflection:**
If one possesses **orthodox faith**, naturally **awakening**,
with **contemplation severed** and **conduct pure**,
the **body untainted**, the **heart clear**, and the **intention pure**,
they will **attain the True Reality**, **realize the fruit**, and **gain retribution**.
If they **practice Great Compassion and Mercy**,
**strictly uphold the wondrous precepts**,
and **face the Supreme Emperor** without wavering through ages,
then **ascension to the celestial realm is attainable**.

Worldly beings, **misled by deluded views**,
**distracted by杂念** and **errant conduct**,
cannot **cultivate the body**, their **hearts are agitated**, their **intentions disordered**,
their **fruit and retribution entangled**—
all because they lack **compassion and do not trust the Dao**.
Thus, though *Radiant-Night* has **just entered the stream of sainthood**,
she still cannot **fully grasp the *Jade Maidens’* wondrous practices**,
let alone **align with them**.
**Intention**—everyone possesses it.
If **refined**, then the *Jade Maidens’* **wondrous practices** reside within you."*

**Chapter Twenty-Four of Divine Communication**:
These *Jade Maidens* are **not truly female**—
they are **Heaven’s True Ones**,
manifesting as *Jade Maidens* to **guide and transform all beings in the Dharma-realm into the Dao**.
Thus, their **forms, colors, and divine powers**,
their **wisdom—both revealed and concealed**,
and their **transformations** are **identical to the Emperor’s**.

At that time, upon hearing this, *Radiant-Night*’s **mind opened in awakening**;
she **bowed in reverence**, **rejoiced**, and **silently returned to her place**.

**Guan Yinzi** declared:
*"These *Jade Maidens* who attend the Jade Emperor—
those who cultivated **wondrous virtues** across **countless eons**—
are **not truly female bodies**;
they are **Heavenly Immortals**, **True Ones of the Dao**,
manifesting as *Jade Maidens* to **transform and guide all beings in the Dharma-realm into the Way**.
Since they are **embodiments of the True Ones**,
their **forms are not female by nature**—
thus their **forms, colors, divine powers, and wisdom**,
whether **concealed or revealed**, are **not shallow or fleeting**,
but **align with the Emperor’s**.

All mortals possess **bodies**,
but the **color-body** is an **illusion**, unable to **diversify and transform**,
making it difficult to **align with the Emperor’s body**.
As for **transformed bodies of demons and spirits**,
they are **deceptive illusions**—
even less worthy of mention.

There are **celestial beings** above—
some **five *li*** distant, some **several *li***, some **one or two *yojanas***,
some **hundreds of billions of *zhang***,
some in **heavenly palaces**, some in **true realms**, some in **human worlds**.
They may **manifest here**, but cannot **transform elsewhere**.
Some may **appear through hearing or sight**, yet cannot **wondrously guide**.
They are **confined to a place**, **bound by time**—
none of these are the **supreme wondrous transformations of the Dharma-body**.

The *Jade Maidens*’ **transformed bodies** appear **throughout all worlds**,
**gathering and dispersing at will**, **transcending all peers**—
their **bodies align with the Emperor’s**.

All **bodies are forms**,
but if their **forms are not wondrously pure**,
or if they are **beautiful yet fleeting**,
they do not **align with the Emperor’s forms**.

The *Jade Maidens*’ **transformed bodies** possess **wondrous, strange, and beautiful forms**,
**perfectly manifesting wherever they appear**,
**unchanging forever**.
Thus, their **forms align with the Emperor’s."*

The **celestial beings, human deities, and demonic Daoists** all possess **divine powers (shén tōng)**, yet their **transformations are limited**, and their **powers do not encompass the Six Perfections (liù tōng)**—thus, their **divine powers do not align with the Emperor’s**.

The *Jade Maidens’* **divine transformations are boundless**, and they **all master the Six Perfections**—thus, their **divine powers align with the Emperor’s**.

Mortals and **spirit-people** all possess **wisdom**, yet they are **obstructed by barriers**, their understanding **incomplete**. Some **borrow forms to illuminate**, yet cannot **fully grasp the truth**—this is not **wisdom aligning with the Emperor’s**.

The *Jade Maidens* **pierce all obscurations without remainder**, their **foresight unobstructed**—thus, their **wisdom aligns with the Emperor’s**.

Those who know **divine powers** all **skillfully conceal themselves**, yet their concealment **leaves traces**—this does not align with the Emperor’s.

The *Jade Maidens*, when dispersed, **return to the Great Emptiness (Tài Xū)**, not merely **swallowing Mount Sumeru as a mustard seed**—this is **wondrous concealment without trace**, their **concealment aligning with the Emperor’s**.

To **conceal is to manifest**; if the **manifestation is not the Great Radiance**, it does not align with the Emperor’s.
The *Jade Maidens* **wondrously reveal the Pure and Subtle**, their **divine forms seen across all realms**—thus, their **manifestation aligns with the Emperor’s**.

To possess **divine powers, wisdom, concealment, and manifestation**—this is the **ability to transform**.
If **transformation relies on contrivance**, it does not align with the Emperor’s.
The *Jade Maidens* **transform wondrously without intent**, their **divine transformations arising naturally**—thus, their **transformation aligns with the Emperor’s**.

At this time, **Yèguāng** heard **Yuánshǐ** speak of the *Jade Maidens’* **wondrous transformations**, and their meaning **fully unfolded**. His heart **suddenly opened and awoke**, comprehending the **source of the *Jade Maidens’* wondrous transformations**. He **kneeling, paid homage**, rejoicing and celebrating in silence, **forgetting speech**, then **returned to his original station**.

**My humble reflection:** The **human body’s yin and yang** are not **distinctly two substances**, but **one becoming two**—**yin nourishes yang, yang generates yin**—this is the **ultimate root**.

When **cultivating the True and attaining the Dao**, the **Six Ding yin-spirits manifest as the *Jade Maidens*’ wondrous transformations**.
Their **marvelous mechanisms** share the same function as the **original spirit’s profound essence**.

This **yin-transformation reveals the numinous**—how could it be limited to the **earthly substance (kūn)**? It **extends to the heavenly body**, **nourishing and gestating**, the **transformation of the Brahmanic qi and yang-light**.

Moreover, the **celestial deities’ transformations are boundless**, their **teachings and guidance of beings** each **adapted to circumstances**.
When **a male form is needed**, they **manifest as male

At that time, the **High Void, Pure Clarity Celestial Sovereign (Tiānzhǔ)** and his **divine retinue** rode in **Eight Auspicious Dragon Chariots**, beneath **Nine Radiant Treasure Canopies**, playing **sacred melodies of the Mysterious Song** and chanting **Sūtras of the Boundless Treasures from the Three Caverns**. They scattered **Celestial Treasure Flowers**, sprayed **Heavenly Pure Fragrances**, and traversed the void in lofty strides, arriving before the **Daoist Assembly**.

By the **virtue/power** of the **Celestial Venerable Emperor (Yùhuáng Dàdì)**, the **Eight Auspicious Dragon Chariots**—the **Eight Scenic Marvels**—manifested as a **Treasure Canopy** in the empty space, sheltering all the gathered **dharma-assembly (fǎhuì)**, without fail or omission.

**Red Pine (Chìsōngzǐ)** remarked: *"When the Jade Maidens of the Night Radiance return to their stations, it is the High Void, Pure Clarity Celestial Sovereign and his retinue from the Original Heaven who come, not the Sovereign of the Distinct Heaven and his retinue."*

When the **High Void, Pure Clarity Celestial Sovereign** and his **divine retinue** arrive, each rides an **Eight Auspicious Radiant Dragon Chariot**, beneath a **Nine Glow Illuminating Treasure Canopy**.

**Eight Auspicious (Bā Jǐng)** has alternate readings: **Eight Auspicious Treasures and Marvels (Bā Bǎo Miào Jǐng)**, **Eight Divine Trigrams’ Scenes (Bāguà Shén Jǐng)**, or **Eight Colored Radiant Scenes (Bā sè Guāng Jǐng)**. Essentially, the **divine chariots of Heaven** encompass the **scenic wonders of the eight directions**, harmonizing the **eight seasonal rhythms**, hence the term **Eight Auspicious**.

They play **sacred melodies of the Great Mysterious Song**, chant **Sūtras of the Boundless Merit and Three Caverns’ Treasures**, scatter **Celestial Marvelous Flowers**, spray **Heavenly Pure Fragrances**, traverse the void in lofty strides, and arrive before the **Daoist Assembly**, respectfully bowing to the **virtue/power** of the **Celestial Venerable Emperor (Yùhuáng Dàdì)**. At that moment, the **Treasure Flowers** coalesce into a **Canopy**, sheltering the entire **dharma-assembly**, without exception.

**My humble reflection:** When **humans cultivate the True (Zhēn)**, they **pay homage to the Celestial Sovereign**, **offer reverence to the Primordial Emperor**, **recite the True Scripture in silence**, and **transform the Pure Void’s divine light**. In the **morning assembly of the Mysterious Realm**, they display **secret marvels of jade flowers**, **encircling and sheltering all the divine beings**. These are all **manifestations of the Primordial Emperor’s secret guidance**, as the **original spirit’s benevolent influence** reaches out. When the **High Void, Pure Clarity Celestial Sovereign** arrives at the **dharma-feast**, he presents **sacred melodies**, rides **divine chariots**, and the **celestial flowers** he scatters, under the **virtue/power** of the **Celestial Venerable Emperor (Yùhuáng Dàdì)**, coalesce into a **Canopy sheltering all without remainder**.

Those with **aspiration**, observing this **scriptural precedent** and **grasping its essence**, will find that the **auspicious transformations of Heaven** are entirely embodied within **one’s own person**.

**Chapter Twenty-Five of the *Divine Transformations* (Shéntōng Pǐn)**

At that time, the **High Void, Pure Clarity Celestial Sovereign**, witnessing this **rare and wondrous event**, bowed his head and knelt respectfully, addressing the **Celestial Venerable Emperor (Yùhuáng Dàdì)**: *"Your lowly servant has been negligent, arriving late at the dharma-feast. Today’s auspicious occasion coincides with the **Encountering of the Sacred Bridge of Compassionate Salvation**. Both the **hidden and the manifest**, the **sage and the common**, all partake in the **blessings of the Sage**. The **great radiance** is revealed, manifesting **rare and wondrous forms**, illuminating the **Heavens above**. The **Four Brahmā (Fàn) Realms** and **Six Desires (Liùyù)**, all the **lands of delight** and **divine assemblies of the True and Sage**, beholding this **radiance**, gather in their entirety. Below, it illuminates the **World of the Boundless Void (Wújí Shìjiè)**, akin to the **Pure Clarity Realm (Xuándū Jìng)**, approaching the **Nine Heavens**, where **spirit winds play melodies** and **tone and pitch harmonize**, resonating through the **cloud courts**, all forming **sacred scriptures**. All beings attain **Daoist transformation**."

Even the **Yin-Tu (Yòudū) Iron Enclosure**, the **endless night of the Nine Abysses**, and all **suffering beings in the underworlds**—they all receive the **light’s virtue/power** and are reborn in the **Heavens**, experiencing **joy and delight**. Today’s **celestial marvelous flowers** coalesce into a **Canopy**, sheltering the entire **dharma-feast**. All the gathered **divine assemblies** receive this **radiance’s virtue/power**.

The **thousand aeons’ merit** of your servants, the **Nine Heavens’ destiny**, the **Dao’s resplendent path**, and the **orthodox dharma’s flourishing**—today’s great auspiciousness fulfills the **lofty aspiration of sacred function**.

**The True Lord of the Fire Sovereign (Huǒdì Zhēnjūn)** declared: *"At the moment when the **Treasure Flowers coalesce into a Canopy**, sheltering all the gathered **divine assemblies**, the **High Void, Pure Clarity Celestial Sovereign** witnesses this **rare and wondrous event**, bowing his head and kneeling, then humbly reports to the **Celestial Venerable Emperor (Yùhuáng Dàdì)** and the **Great Jade Emperor (Yùhuáng Dàdì)**, saying: ‘Your lowly servant has been negligent and remiss, arriving late at the **dharma-feast**. Today’s auspicious hour and festive heavens coincide with the **Encountering of the Sacred Bridge of Compassionate Salvation**.’*

**Bridge (Qiáo)** refers to what **mortals construct** to **cross rivers and streams**, avoiding **barefoot wading**. However, all **worldly bridges** require **wood or stone** to form, and their **salvage is limited**, prone to **damage and destruction**—even the **Great Yangtze, mighty rivers, and vast seas** cannot be crossed by such means.

Yet the **scriptural merit and sacred function’s virtue/power** **salvage the boundless eons**, **encircle the sand-realm (shājiè)**, without need of **construction or form**. Through **subtle transformation and divine mechanisms**, they **guide beings out of the River of Love**, **away from the Sea of Desire**, **free from the Blood Lake**, and **dispel the Flood Disaster**, enduring forever without decay—thus the term **Sacred Bridge of Compassionate Salvation**.

Both the **hidden and the manifest**, the **sage and the common**—all partake equally in the **blessings of the utmost sage**.

The Jade Emperor emitted the **Universal Radiant Great Bright Light**, manifesting the **rare and wondrous divine form**, illuminating all the **realms of the heavens**—the **Four Brahmā heavens, the Six Desire realms**, and every **pure land of bliss**. All **celestial beings, immortals, divine saints, and sacred assemblies** beheld this **Great Bright Light**, and **clouds swiftly gathered in assembly**.

The clouds converged—**suddenly filling the sky**, unknown in origin.
The **sacred assembly gathered like clouds**, hence the term **"cloud-gathering"**.

Its light shone downward upon the **boundless worlds of the Lower Realm**, all aligned with the **Pure and Subtle Heavenly Pure Domain**, drawing near to the **Nine Sovereign Celestial Heights**. Within the light, **divine winds played celestial harmonies**, blending like **palace-scale and commercial tones** in perfect accord.

Though **music’s five tones**—**metal, wood, water, fire, earth**—are divided into **pure and impure**, aligned with the **Five Phases**, their **natural marvels** may yet be hard to replicate. Yet the **Heavenly Divine Winds** harmonize effortlessly, surpassing mortal music. Their **resonant, vibrant sounds** in the **Cloud Court** all coalesce into the **Three Caverns’ Precious Chapters**.

All beings in the **Lower Realms** attained the **Great Dao’s profound transformation**. The **Yin-Tu prisons**, the **Iron Encircled City**, the **Eternal Night of the Nine Abysses**—all tormented souls in the **Nine Hells** now **reverently submit to the Jade Emperor’s Great Bright Light’s power**, ascending to **celestial palaces** and receiving **bliss**.

Today, the **Heavenly Treasures’ wondrous flowers** I scattered **swirled and formed a canopy**, **overshadowing the sacred law-assembly’s gathering**, all **reverently submitting to the Heavenly Sovereign Jade Emperor’s mighty virtue and divine power**.

I, the **Clear and Bright Heavenly Sovereign**, and others—this is not merely fortune for one age. Encountering this **rare marvel**, we have cultivated **meritorious causes across countless eons**, now meeting the **Nine-Heaven’s auspicious convergence**. The **Heavenly Dao’s boundless expanse** flourishes, the **Supreme Mysterious Law** thrives in grandeur.

One says: *"The Primordial Sovereign’s enlightenment unfolded the **Supreme Law**, the **august winds** were pure and vast, the **Dao** spread evenly—no heretical paths existed, just the **flourishing of the True Law**."* This is acceptable.

Today’s **auspicious hour** is **greatly fortunate**. All **celestial beings and myriad creatures** attain the **Supreme Mysterious Transformation’s blessings**.

One also says: *"All aspire to revere the **Mysterious Function**, humbly presenting the **Dao’s essentials**."* This too is acceptable.

In reflection: Though the **human body is small**, it **embodies heaven and earth**, containing all things, encompassing all marvels. The **pure, empty, and refined qi** governs the **Six Yang**, and there exists the **High and Pure Clear-Bright Heavenly Sovereign**.

If the **original spirit wanders unmastered**, the **profound transformation remains unseen**, one **sinks into the waves of grace**, the **mechanism drowned in the sea of suffering**. The **great currents and monstrous tides** surge endlessly—how can one **avoid drowning**, **rescue the deluded**?

If **one alone is immersed**, they **plunge others into ruin**, harming self and others—this need not be discussed. Those **stagnant in the lesser vehicle**, **bewildered by tangential paths**, their **flow without source**, **inevitably dry up**—this too is unworthy of mention.

Sometimes, the **spiritual source is deepened**, the **Dao’s pulse connected**, nearly **transformed**. Yet if one **hoards their essence**, the **grace descends not**, and this is **far from ultimate attainment**.

Thus, some **realize the fruits of the Four Brahmā and Six Desire realms** but **fail to reach the Nine Sovereign’s Seven-Treasured Domain**, receiving **human blessings** or becoming **prison wardens and demon kings**, even **sinking into the Three Evil Paths** and **Nine Abyssal Realms**—**woe beyond measure!**

When the **profound transformation is not manifest**, the **wondrous resonance unseen**, the **true scriptures fail to circulate**, the **jade flowers lack luster**—this stems from **not planting meritorious causes**, **not trusting the True Law**. Unable to **hear the boundless, even Dao**, one **cannot revere the Mysterious Function**.

If one **concentrates the Mysterious Spirit**, becomes the **Heavenly Sovereign**, the **pure, empty, and refined essence**—when the **later stages unfold**, they **penetrate Caoqi’s grove**, **absorb the Western River’s essence**, **merge with the Golden Elixir**, and **ascend to the Dao’s shore**. The **sea of suffering and karmic pits** are **forever annihilated**; one **transcends the Six Desires**, **rises above the Four Brahmā**, **gathers all spirits**, and **illuminates the hidden realms**.

The **divine winds stir the true**, the **wondrous resonance is unparalleled**—the **true scriptures circulate without cessation**, all things **receive endless grace**. The **Yin-Tu prisons are broken**, the **Nine Abysses illuminated**, the **hells transformed into pure lands**, and **sinful beings attain bliss**. One’s **darkness turns to radiance**; the **jade flowers bloom in crimson hues**, **overshadowing all marvels**. This is the **real and void’s essence**, the **original spirit’s power**.

Without **cultivating virtuous causes**, **firmly trusting the True Law**, how could one **hear the Heavenly Dao’s refreshing winds**, **revere the Mysterious Function**?

Ah! This **body’s true marvel**—**witnessing the Clear-Bright Heavenly Sovereign’s later law-assembly**, **celebrating the Sacred Bridge’s encounter**. **Proclaiming the Sacred Transformation**, **extolling the Mysterious Function**—this is the **Dao’s salvation for both hidden and manifest beings**.

To **cultivate meritorious causes**, **broaden wondrous deeds**, **not seeking swift transformation**—the **marvel is natural**. This too **verifies the Sacred True Precepts**.

Let those who **seek the Dao** savor this **of their own accord**.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Divine Powers**

At that time, during this **sacred assembly**, all **revered the Mysterious Function**.

The **High and Pure Clear-Bright Heavenly Sovereign**—as explained before—**with verses praised the Jade Emperor**:

*"Clear-Bright Heavenly Sovereign,*
*With verses, the Jade Emperor is praised.*

*The Golden Gate’s Primordial Vault Sovereign,*
*(Note: Some texts read ‘Sovereign’ instead of ‘Vault.’ Examining the scripture’s intent, the Jade Emperor is the Heavenly Sovereign, the **Buddhas’ teacher**, ruling the **Yellow Golden Gate**, the **Pure Vault’s Azure Expanse’s ancestral elder**—hence ‘Sovereign.’ Some read ‘Sovereign,’ referring merely to the Heavenly Emperor.)*

*The Highest Jade Sovereign’s Venerable One,*
*(As explained before.)*

*Whose wondrous form surpasses all heavens.*
*(All celestial beings and gods possess beautiful forms—some decayed or limited by their heavens’ transformations, unable to fully manifest. The Jade Emperor’s **form and beauty are boundless**, his **appearance uniquely surpassing all heavens.**)*

*The merciful light illuminates the Three Realms.*
*(The **great compassionate light** pierces **heaven, earth, and humanity**—hence ‘universally illuminating the Three Realms.’)*

*The True and Sacred Mysterious Dao’s Master."* *(The **one true, supreme sacred, divine, and wondrous Dao’s master**.)*

The Jade Emperor’s conduct is the **True and Sacred Mysterious Dao’s Master**—
the **Way’s sovereign teacher**.

Heaven and humanity rely upon this teacher.
The Jade Emperor is the **preceptor of heaven and humanity**, the **sovereign of all gods**, the **sacred deity of the Highest Heaven**.
All beings in the world revere and depend upon him, relying upon his **virtue and transformative power**—
he is the **teacher of heaven and humanity**.

The **Great Vehicle’s teachings** descend in speech,
the **Dao’s Three Vehicles**, divided into **high, middle, and low**.
There is also the **supreme single Vehicle**, transcending stages,
exalted above the three grades, encompassing all without remainder—
this is the **Great Vehicle**.

The gods’ teachings vary with their wisdom and insight.
The Great Vehicle is rare to hear.
The Jade Emperor’s teachings clearly demonstrate the **true宗 (zong)**, penetrating both high and low,
embracing all grades.
All beings benefit from his instruction, all attain liberation—
this is the **Great Vehicle’s descending speech**.

The **True One points out the lost path**.
The Jade Emperor, with the **true宗 (zong) and mysterious unity of wondrous principle**,
clearly illuminates and awakens those lost—
this is the **direct pointing, single transmission**, preventing beings from falling into minor, tangential teachings.
It is to guide them along the **great path**, so they do not stray into false ways.

His **virtue and power are as boundless as the void**.
All things under heaven have limits.
Only the void endures through kalpas without change.
The Jade Emperor’s **great virtue and supreme power** are immeasurable, like the void—
inexhaustible, beyond reckoning.
Other gods possess virtue and power, some distant, some near, some small, some great,
but they can only be compared proportionally.
The Jade Emperor’s virtue and power have no equal—
thus, like the void, they are **praiseworthy without end**.

Praise for the Jade Emperor, like the void, is inexhaustible.
Reverence for him is boundless.
Praise is without limit.
His **august virtue cannot be named**.

Yellow Stone Master said:
*"The Highest, Clear, and Illuminating Heavenly Sovereign,
though he may appear later at the Law Assembly,
truly saw the Jade Emperor’s wondrous transformations—
divine mien and marvelous sights—
and, filled with reverence, composed this wondrous verse
to praise the Jade Emperor."*

In ancient times, Zai Wo, Zi Gong, and You Ruo praised Confucius with profound insight,
demonstrating wisdom sufficient to know the Sage.
Now, the Clear and Illuminating Heavenly Sovereign praises the Jade Emperor’s virtue as boundless,
his praise without end—
no other eulogy matches this depth.
This is the wisdom of Zai Wo, Zi Gong, and You Ruo in recognizing Confucius.
This verse may truly be called **profound speech**.

**My humble reflection:**
The **original spirit of the human body** remains unaltered through kalpas.
The **true master of the four limbs** is the **source of all things**.
Its wondrous excellence surpasses the six yang,
its compassion protects the Three Elements.
It is the **true teacher of the self**—
the **qi and spirit** upon which all depends.

Its **illuminating light and resonant sound** are the **supreme Law**,
directly shattering delusion,
guiding one to **universal practice**,
embodying **mysterious essence and wondrous function**.
Where its **virtue extends**, it equals the void.
How could praise for it ever be exhausted?
If one cannot **turn inward and reflect**, failing to recognize this **true宗 (zong)**,
how could they know the Jade Emperor’s virtue?
How much less could they grasp the **benefits of the scriptures**?
It is no wonder they fail to **secretly awaken to the true body**.

The Clear and Illuminating Heavenly Sovereign, gazing upon the Jade Emperor’s virtue,
composed this wondrous verse to praise him—
not only to exalt the **Heavenly Blessing**,
but also to **command humanity to turn inward**.

If one truly **harmonizes with the original truth**,
knows the **power of the Law**,
follows Heaven without partiality,
and shares in the Emperor’s virtue,
they will not be confused by other paths,
will not lose Heaven’s treasure,
and may aspire to the **supreme Sage**.
**Aspiring scholars, take heed!**

**Chapter on Divine Transformations (Twenty-Eight Sections):**
He is the **Sovereign of the Vaulting Sky**, the **Exalted One of kalpas**,
possessing **wondrous vision and wondrous knowledge**,
unequaled, unmatched.
He is **profoundly still and purely true**, neither absent nor present,
the **supreme Sage and supreme Spirit**,
the **great divine transformation**,
the **treasure-house of light**,
the **great man** who **enlightens heaven and humanity**,
teaching without end,
with **great compassion and great mercy**,
rolling forth the **Law Wheel**.

For the sake of **delivering all beings**, he is called the **Jade Emperor**,
the **True Elder of the Vaulting Sky**,
**pure and clear**, **wise and eloquent**,
the **supreme Dao and supreme Sovereign**.

He opens the path for all beings—
thus, he emits this light.

At that time, the **Highest, Clear, and Illuminating Heavenly Sovereign**
finished his verse of praise and sat in silent stillness.

Wei Boyang said:
*"The Highest, Clear, and Illuminating Heavenly Sovereign extolled the Jade Emperor’s virtue—
not merely with ten lines of praise.
This Jade Emperor is the **august and solemn Sovereign of the Vaulting Sky**,
the **Exalted One of kalpas**.
All kalpas have their numbers—
whether billions or myriads—
yet none can truly be called ‘vast.’
The Jade Emperor has, from antiquity, been the **preceptor of the ten thousand heavens**,
enduring kalpas beyond count,
his breadth and depth beyond measure—
thus, he is the **Exalted One of kalpas**.

His radiance is without remainder,
his divine transformations wondrous and clear,
his penetration unobstructed,
his enlightenment profound and wondrous—
none can equal or compare to him.
He shines **purely luminous and profoundly still**,
**towering and unmoving**, yet **quiet and boundless**,
his Dao **true and unchanging**, **unstained and unsullied**,
his **virtue supremely pure**.
If he seems **vanished**, it is not true vanishing—
merely the **natural emptiness of the void**.
If he seems **present**, it is not clinging to existence—
merely the **wondrous non-duality of the formless**.
If he seems **both present and vanished**, it is **indescribable and beyond analysis**.

All **immortals, Buddhas, and gods** revere the Jade Emperor as the **supreme among Sages**.
No god’s **spiritual penetration** matches his.
He is the **supreme Mysterious Spirit**,
his transformations **sixfold and transcendent**, surpassing all.
Truly, he possesses **great divine transformation**,
his light **pervasive and enduring**,
pure and unstained, ever brighter, never dimmed—
the **true treasure-house of light**, storing boundless radiance.

None surpasses him in **supreme sovereignty**.
The Jade Emperor’s **Law is natural and spontaneous**,
vast and immeasurable, without end.
Truly, he is the **great man**—
the world’s **worthy ones** perfect their bodies and natures,
rectify themselves to rectify all,
encompassing heaven and earth.
Who among **great men** could surpass the Jade Emperor,
who **transforms heaven and earth**, gives birth to all things,
whose beginning is unseen and whose end is unknown?
He is the **most exalted among Sages**, the **greatest among gods**.
Which great man could rival him?

He **enlightens and transforms all beings and heavens**,
his teachings **perfect and his Dao revealed**—
without end.
His **compassion covers all things**, his **mercy pities all beings**—
boundless and without limit."*

The **great compassion and great mercy** are faithfully upheld,
and the **Law-wheel of transformation** shines ever-bright,
so that none are stagnant or concealed.

*"Huàn"* may also be read as *"zhuǎn"*—but that is too restrictive.

To **enlighten and deliver** all beings,
thus the title **"Jade Emperor"** is bestowed.

The **august and venerable Origin of the Azure Vault**—
divine, mysterious, and perfectly boundless—
**pure and pristine**, of **great wisdom and great insight**,
his **eloquence surpasses all measure**,
his **virtue/power** never exhausted,
his **transformative efficacy** never spent—
the **supreme Dao** is beyond quantification,
his **exalted sovereignty** unmatched.

Now he **enlightens and delivers** all beings,
thus he manifests the **great compassion and universal luminous virtue/power**.

At that time, the **High and Void Pure-Luminous Heavenly Sovereign** spoke this **gāthā** in praise,
then sat in **silent stillness**.

**My humble reflection**: The **original spirit** of the human body is the **Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven**,
also called **True Sovereign**, **Mysterious Ancestor**, **Ancestral Reality**, **Heavenly Lord**, **Essence of Nature**, **Ancestral True Sovereign**, **Dharma-nature**, **Wondrous Luminous True Mind**, **Pure Nature**, **Playful Spirit**, **True Master**, **Playful Light**, **Great Staff**, **Dharma King**, **Wondrous Treasure**, **True Root**, **Buddha-nature**, **True Seed**, and **Elixir Origin**.

The **True Sovereign** of one’s being—
**divine, wondrous, and peerless**—
**luminous essence** without end,
**enlightening yin and yang**,
whose **spiritual intelligence** is beyond measure.

He **compassionately nurtures** all wonders,
**responds universally** with perfect clarity.

Most **exalted and noble**, his **transformative efficacy** is endless.
Silently merging with **refined qi**,
he **nurtures the true spirit**.

Thus, the **true light** occasionally reveals itself,
and the **wondrous mechanism** perpetually generates.

Those who truly grasp this
will **spontaneously produce the divine embryo**,
and share the **Jade Emperor’s merit and virtue/power**—
his **Dao-transformation** is boundless.

Only when one **affirms the Pure-Luminous Heavenly Sovereign’s gāthā** in praise of the Jade Emperor
does one attain **true knowledge and genuine awakening**.

Otherwise, the **true wondrousness** is unattained,
and the **Jade Emperor’s transformation** remains unrecognized.

The **Pure-Luminous gāthā**—
if recited as though in a dream,
how could one gain the **fruit of the scriptures**,
or attain **real benefit**?

Alas! The **Dao of Nature** resides within us—
the **true wondrousness** is self-sufficient.

If one **comprehends the wondrous luminous mechanism**,
then one truly **responds to and upholds the Jade Emperor’s radiant virtue/power**.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine on Divine Powers**

Thus, the **Heavenly Sovereign** again instructed the **Four Assemblies**:

"This **Jade Emperor’s body** is the **Dao-body** itself—
**not an ordinary form**.

This is the **body of boundless merit/virtue**,
the **body of pure and pristine naturalness**,
the **firmly luminous, unshakable true void, supreme Dharma-body**.

His **awe and spirit** are vast and profound,
his **name and reputation** spread universally—
no darkness escapes his illumination,
his **divine mystery** stands towering and majestic,
beyond all description.

**The Barefoot Immortal** said:
"The **Pure-Luminous Heavenly Sovereign** praised the Jade Emperor in a gāthā,
then sat in silent stillness once more.

At this moment, the **Originating Heavenly Sovereign** again instructed the **Four Assemblies** in the **Dharma-gathering**:

"This **Jade Emperor’s wondrous transformation** is the **Great Dao-body** itself—
**not an ordinary form**.

The **Dao** is formless—
how can one speak of a **body**?

Though the **Dao** is **void and formless**,
boundless and endless,
it **transforms all things**,
achieves the **beginning and end**,
stirring **yin and yang** without pause—
**true void yet with substantial essence**,
not merely empty.

The Jade Emperor’s **merit/virtue** is like the **void**,
his **spirit** aligns with the **Dao**,
thus it is said: *‘The Emperor’s body is the Dao-body—*
**not an ordinary form.’**

This is the **body of boundless merit/virtue**,
the **body of true purity and pristine naturalness**, unconstrained.

**Merit** has limits,
**virtue** has bounds—
how could they be **endless**?

The Jade Emperor **transforms all worlds**,
unchanged since ancient times—
where are the limits?

**Colored forms and images** are **constrained and stagnant**,
not **pure, pristine, and naturally free**.

The Jade Emperor is **never stained or attached**,
achieving **great ease and freedom**—
is this not **naturalness**?

This is the **divinely luminous, firm, and unyielding**,
the **true void that never decays**,
the **supreme, unmatched wondrous Dharma-body of transformation**.

All **manifested things** in the world will perish,
yet the **void** remains eternal.
The **perishing** are not **firm and unyielding**,
nor **divinely luminous**.

The **Great Void** exists,
and thus the **void** becomes **true reality**.

The Jade Emperor’s **spirit and penetration** endure through all ages unharmed,
his **playful light** shines across **kalpas** undimmed—
not only **most divine and luminous**,
but **firm as unpolished jade**,
**unbreakable as the void itself**,
**never destroyed**, **eternally unshaken**.

This is the **abiding true void**,
the **unscattered wondrous essence**,
the **supreme, peerless wondrous Dharma-body**.

His **awe and virtue/power**, his **spiritual radiance**—
how could they be **easily fathomed or explored**?
Vast and magnanimous,
boundless and great—
his **name and reputation** are beyond thought,
**pervading and filling** all ten directions.

His **light illuminates** even the finest dust,
no darkness escapes his gaze.

His **divine powers** are **mysterious and profound**,
towering and immeasurable,
**resounding yet nameless**,
beyond all description.

**My humble reflection**: The **human nature’s luminous spirit**—
**divine, mysterious, and self-sufficient**—
the **Three Bodies** are complete,
the **Four Wisdoms** are fulfilled.
The **vast and sincere qi**,
the **true and singular essence**—
all **ten thousand goods and wonders**,
what is not possessed?

Truly, in this **humble body**,
the **Three Noble Positions** are **fulfilled**,
and the **Four Great Responsibilities** are **accomplished**—
no **questions** or **rest** can be attained.

Its **origin is not ordinary**—
it is the **Dao-body**,
the **body of boundless merit/virtue**,
the **body of pure and pristine naturalness**,
the **firmly luminous, unshakable true void, supreme Dharma-body**.

Yet **common people** indulge recklessly,
**wasting this body** in vain.
Their **hearts burdened**, their **spirits exhausted**,
their **essence drained**, their **qi scattered**,
the **Dao of Nature** remains **unclear**.

Who could **grasp the vital essence**,
or **comprehend the Dao’s core**—
lost in **illusory forms**, their **void exhausted**,
they **fritter away this life**,
existence and annihilation like a dream—
**nothing known**, **nothing understood**,
how could they **attain transformation**?

Some **claim to exhaust divine virtue/power** in perfecting nature,
yet they **do not ultimately preserve** their attainment.

Thus, **people cannot exhaust the spirit** to **attain transformation**,
nor **return to the void** to become **immortal**,
nor **merge with the Dao** to realize **true reality**.

Only the **name of supreme sovereignty** is **never destroyed**—
the Jade Emperor, who **takes the Dao as his body**,
whose **merit/virtue** is **boundless**,
whose **nature is pure and pristine**,
whose **spirit is firmly luminous**,
whose **true void never decays**,
whose **supreme Dharma-body** stands **unmatched**.

For those **first entering the sacred stream**,
who have **not yet crossed the single barrier**,
who **observe yet do not penetrate**,
whose **words remain unawakened**,
whose **thoughts do not align with life and death**,
who **do not know** the **spirit’s source of divinity**,
whose **studies fail to harmonize** with **heaven and humanity**,
who **do not know** the **transformation’s essence**—
they **abandon themselves to the Dao’s ineffability**,
hoping to **glimpse** the **mysterious and profound**,
seeking the **noble scholars** of **void and luminosity**.

「The Primordial Sage takes pity on sentient beings’ long-standing delusion,
and proclaims the **virtue/power** of the Sovereign’s boundless reach,
fully awakening the deaf and blind of all worldly ages,
to manifest the **mysterious and profound** efficacy of **divine transformation**—
truly great in **compassion** and deep in **benevolence**,
desiring sentient beings to enter **perfection**,
also expanding His **awe-inspiring and spiritual** might,
pervading His **renown**,
illuminating the **profound and hidden**,
**divine and wondrous**, **majestic and unshakable**,
whose **virtue** defies **naming**.
This is the **Great Wish** of the **Celestial Sovereign**.
Yet, the realm of the world drifts in chaos,
and human hearts sink in **mire**,
unable to follow the **Celestial Sovereign’s** ordinances—
how could they **bear** the Primordial Sage’s instructions?

Alas, the **principle** unites **heaven and humanity**,
and the **sage and the common** share the same **heart**—
yet they cannot **aspire to sainthood** or **heavenly transcendence**.
The **Dao/Way** unfolds **naturally**,
and to fail here is to **fall short** of the **true scriptures**,
the **great Dao/Way**,
the **parental origins**,
and the **living body** itself.
This is the **will of the enlightened**.

The **Thirty Chapters of Divine Perfections**—
this is the **Celestial Sovereign**, not **dependent** on **merit/virtue** cultivated through **deliberate actions**.
Though the **Celestial Sovereign** once descended into the mortal realm,
spanning countless **eons** to **manifest teachings**,
demonstrating **great divine powers**,
His **body remains pure and pristine**—
never ceasing to **abide in the Golden Palace**,
**dividing His form** across the **ten directions**,
**adapting His presence** to each realm,
**benefiting all sentient beings**,
**elevating them to the Dao/Way’s shore**,
**universally bestowing** the **teachings and methods**,
**awakening successors**—
if they **follow the instructions** and **practice diligently**,
they may **ascend to the highest truth** and **fulfill the great Dao/Way**.

By these **supreme and wondrous** **merit/virtue** and **efficacy**,
His **radiance** perpetually **fills all the heavens**,
His **divine wisdom** **reaches beyond measure**,
**ineffable and transcendent**.
The **Wondrous Conduct True Person** says:
This **Celestial Sovereign**—
**divine and wondrous**, **majestic and unshakable**,
whose **virtue** defies **naming**—
is not **dependent** on **deliberate actions** or **merit/virtue** cultivated through **strenuous effort**.
In the past, though He **descended** to **receive birth** among mortals,
spanning countless **eons** to **broadly manifest teachings**,
displaying **great divine powers**,
His **manifestation**—
like **abandoning kingship** to **practice**, severing **affection** to **seek the Dao/Way**,
administering **medicine** to **heal illnesses**, expounding **teachings** and **propagating transformation**,
**enduring suffering** and **delighting in renunciation**—
attained the **rank of Golden Immortal**,
and **taught Bodhisattvas** across **many eons**.

Thus, the **scriptures of liberation** record the **cause and effect** of **Buddhas and living beings**,
saying that from **Tushita Heaven**,
He **rode the fragrant elephant** and **descended** into the **womb of Maya**,
thereby giving birth to **the Sage of the World**.
This too is but one **manifestation** of the **Celestial Sovereign’s** **adaptive teachings**.

Elsewhere, He **attended the assembly of the floating lotus**,
**presided over the gathering of the precious pearl**,
**transformed into the form of common folk**,
**transformed into the form of Dao/Way-seekers**,
**responding to encounters** with **spiritual efficacy**,
**universally liberating without ceasing**,
**acting as sovereign** of all **heavenly realms**,
His **divine powers** **beyond measure**.
Though He **manifested teachings** across countless **eons**,
displaying **great divine powers**,
His **Dharma-body** remains **pure and pristine**,
**majestic and unshakable**—
never ceasing to **abide in the Golden Palace**.
When the Primordial Sage was about to **proclaim the Jade Scripture**,
the **Celestial Sovereign** **emitted great radiance**,
**dividing His form** to **pervade the ten directions**,
filling all **great heavenly palaces**.
In every **world**—
**upper heavens**, **lower earths**, **mortal realms**—
all **beheld** His **radiance**,
each **received benefits**,
all **found joy**,
and **heard the Great Vehicle**.

This **dividing of His form** and **adaptive manifestation**,
**benefiting all sentient beings**,
**elevating them to the Dao/Way’s shore**,
**universally bestowing** the **teachings and methods**,
**awakening successors**—
if they **follow the instructions** and **revere the Sovereign’s commands**,
they may **ascend to the highest truth** and **fulfill the great Dao/Way**.
The **Celestial Sovereign**, relying on these **supreme and wondrous** **merit/virtue** and **efficacy**,
thus **emits radiance** that perpetually **fills all the heavens**,
His **divine wisdom** **reaches beyond measure**,
**ineffable and transcendent**.
The **Great Radiance** is not merely so—
His **virtue** is **vast**, and His **radiance** is **wondrous**.
The **divine wisdom** **reaches beyond measure**—
His **divine intelligence** is **wondrous**, and His **Dao/Way** is **manifest**.
Thus, it is clear that the **Celestial Sovereign** is not **dependent** on **merit/virtue** cultivated through **deliberate actions**.

I **reflect**: the **primordial spirit** of humanity
remains **vast and unchanging** as the **eons**,
its **divine radiance** **wondrous and profound**—
how could it be **named** by **words**?
Much less could it **arise** from **actions of the heart**!

**Perception, hearing, awareness, and knowledge**—
**actions of standing, sitting, or lying down**,
**eating, breathing, speaking, or remaining silent**,
**responding to stimuli** with **effortless grace**—
though **adapting to circumstances** with **wondrous efficacy**,
its **pure and pristine** **essence** never **abandons the Golden Palace**,
**congealing** into the **mysterious and profound** **spiritual embryo**,
while **true and real** as it is,
never **departing** from itself.
**Thousands, hundreds of millions of transformations**,
**adapting to each realm** to **benefit all**,
**giving birth** to **ascension on the Dao/Way’s shore**,
**broadly proclaiming** the **spiritual treasury**,
**awakening the later heavens**.
**Guarding secrets** and **holding fast to truth**,
**transcending the common** to **attain sainthood**,
**all transformations** **fulfilled**,
**no fruit** **left unattained**.
By this **wondrous conduct**,
a **single glimmer** of **mysterious radiance** suffuses all,
**beyond measure**—
the **Dao/Way’s efficacy** is **strange and verified**,
how could it be **calculated or quantified**?

To **observe** the **Celestial Sovereign’s** **saintly virtue** and **divine efficacy**,
**independent of cultivation** and **beyond measure**—
are there not **many instances** of this?

Though **attaining true nature** may be **uniform**,
those who **recklessly abandon** it are **countless**,
allowing the **pure and pristine** **true nature** to be **obscured by lust and delusion**,
like **dust burying a bright mirror**,
so that **radiance** does not **shine**,
and **beauty and ugliness** go **unseen**,
while **wondrous intent** **fails to manifest**.
Yet, if **dust is scraped away** and **radiance polished daily**,
**new and ever-growing**,
**responding to stimuli without effort**,
**true reality** **abides freely**—
in the **Golden Palace** and **Purple Realm**,
the **primordial spirit** **dwells eternally**.
**Ever-responsive, ever-still**,
**undisturbed by anything**.
In **wondrous discernment**, it **unifies all** with **one thread**,
and in **manifest actions**, it **follows naturally** without **emotion**.
**Great compassion** and **great benevolence**—
His **wondrous intent** **never wanes**,
**all transformations** **radiant and profound**,
**beyond enumeration**.
His **cultivation** is **boundless**,
His **true radiance** **universally pervades**,
His **merit/virtue** **beyond conception**—
ah!

This is the **inherent nature** of **Dao/Way-practitioners**,
not **dependent** on **deliberate actions**,
nor **achievable** by **stubborn emptiness**.
It is **both present and absent**—
**neither having nor not having**.
The **good scholar** **embodies** it.

The **Thirty-First Chapter of Divine Perfections**—
**this is the radiance of His body**,
all **possessing wondrous names**.
The **Great Divine Perfections Radiance**—
the **Great Compassionate Radiance**,
the **Great Joyous Renunciation Radiance**,
the **Great Enduring Suffering Radiance**,
the **Great Equanimous Radiance**,
the **Great Gentle Harmony Radiance**,
the **Great Autonomous Radiance**,
the **Great Beneficial Radiance**,
the **Great Wish-Fulfilling Radiance**,
the **Great Wisdom Radiance**,
the **Great Auspicious Radiance**,
the **Great Liberation Radiance**,
the **Great Refuge Radiance**,
the **Great Merit/Virtue Radiance**,
the **Great Perfect Radiance**,
the **Great Unobstructed Radiance**,
the **Radiance No One Can Surpass**.
The **Great Wisdom True Person** says:
All the **great radiance** **emitted** by the **Celestial Sovereign’s** **body**
**possesses supreme and wondrous names**.」

The **Great Radiance** names are thus: the **Great God-Transcending Radiance**, the **Great Compassionate Radiance**, the **Great Joyous Renunciation Radiance**, the **Great Enduring Suffering Radiance**, the **Great Equanimous Radiance**, the **Great Gentle Harmony Radiance**, the **Great Autonomous Radiance**, the **Great Beneficial Radiance**, the **Great Wish-Fulfilling Radiance**, the **Great Wisdom Radiance**, the **Great Auspicious Radiance**, the **Great Liberation Radiance**, the **Great Refuge Radiance**, the **Great Virtue/Power Radiance**, the **Great Perfect Radiance**, the **Great Unobstructed Radiance**, and the **Radiance No One Can Surpass**—these are the seventeen great radiance lights.

The **Celestial Sovereign** universally extends and illuminates all things, with wondrous deeds and accumulated proofs, possessing great **virtue/power** and **qi** and attaining the six **god-transcending** abilities. The **Great God-Transcending Radiance** is resplendent, pervading all. This is the first radiance name.

Next, the **Celestial Sovereign** possesses great compassion and great pity; compassion and pity are boundless, and the radiance is wondrous and vast. The **Great Compassionate Radiance** is the second.

Again, the **Celestial Sovereign** truly rejoices in renunciation; renunciation is boundless, and the wondrous radiance universally shines. The **Great Joyous Renunciation Radiance** is the third.

The **Celestial Sovereign** has endured great suffering through countless eons; endurance is limitless, and the radiance is unceasing, with no obstruction. The **Great Enduring Suffering Radiance** is the fourth.

The **Celestial Sovereign** has practiced great equanimity in the past; equanimity is unending, and the radiance is unassailable. The **Great Equanimous Radiance** is the fifth.

In past eons, the **Celestial Sovereign** has also cultivated great gentle harmony; gentle and yielding, yet tranquil and harmonious, this vast **Dao/Way** never alters, and the radiance pervades all, inexhaustible. The **Great Gentle Harmony Radiance** is the sixth.

The **Celestial Sovereign’s** **virtue/power** is serene and unchanging, transcending all and autonomous. The radiance is vast and boundless, with no end. The **Great Autonomous Radiance** is the seventh.

The **Celestial Sovereign’s** benevolence is boundless, encompassing all and benefiting them eternally; the benefits are endless, and the law’s radiance universally illuminates. The **Great Beneficial Radiance** is the eighth.

The **Celestial Sovereign’s** body transcends all proofs and attains wondrous awakening, pure and natural. The **Celestial Sovereign** is the **Dharma King** of the **Buddha’s** coming, and after countless eons of cultivation, the **Celestial Sovereign** attains this station. Thus, the greatest **virtue/power** emerges from the mindless, and **god-transcending** transformations align with wishes. The **Great Wish-Fulfilling Radiance** is the ninth.

The **Celestial Sovereign** possesses great wisdom and great **palpitating insight** (大慧). Wisdom and insight surpass all kinds, and the radiance is peerless. The **Great Wisdom Radiance** is the tenth.

The **Celestial Sovereign** is fundamentally the most exalted goodness, forever auspicious. With this radiance, all is illuminated without cessation. The **Great Auspicious Radiance** is the eleventh.

The **Celestial Sovereign** has long understood and attained great liberation; liberation is natural and unconstrained, and the golden radiance endures. The **Great Liberation Radiance** is the twelfth.

The **Celestial Sovereign** aligns with the **Great Dao/Way**, and the wondrous law is natural and unchanging. The **Celestial Sovereign** has maintained true faith through countless eons, never generating doubt or regression. All beings in the ten directions and future ages universally revere and submit to this eternal radiance, never dimming. The **Great Refuge Radiance** is the thirteenth.

The **Celestial Sovereign** universally saves all beings without exception, with **virtue/power** most vast, and the radiance shines eternally without depletion. The **Great Virtue/Power Radiance** is the fourteenth.

With **virtue/power** complete and the **Dao/Way** fulfilled, the **Celestial Sovereign’s** **virtue/power** is perfect, and the radiance endures forever in splendor. The **Great Perfect Radiance** is the fifteenth.

Though stained by dust, the **Celestial Sovereign** is inherently pure; **god-transcending** transformations are complete and radiant, and the **Celestial Sovereign’s** **virtue/power** shines eternally without obstruction. The **Great Unobstructed Radiance** is the sixteenth.

Among **god-transcending** beings, this is the most noble; among sages, this is the most revered. The **Celestial Sovereign** is the master of all heavens, the teacher of all **Buddhas**, and no being in the vast **Dao/Way** of the **Dharma Realm** can compare to the **Celestial Sovereign**. Therefore, the radiance perpetually fills all realms, and the **god-transcending** transformations are beyond measure. Is not the **Radiance No One Can Surpass** the seventeenth great radiance?

As for these seventeen great radiance lights of **god-transcending** and wondrous meaning, only the **Celestial Sovereign** of today can truly perceive them. How can **god-transcending** beings measure this?

The fool notes: In the mortal world, upright nature is the root. Therefore, the **Dao/Way** of immortals is actualized, with this as the **Great Radiance** seed. Yet though all true seeds are possessed, none preserve them. Thus, in the field of delusion, one must cultivate and purify the **karma** of causes and conditions.

Therefore, there is one kind of supreme excellent cause, and there is one level of **god-transcending** and wondrous radiance. The **Celestial Sovereign** has cultivated countless wondrous deeds, which are beyond measure. Why speak of seventeen great radiance lights? It is because the **Dao/Way** is profound and difficult to comprehend, and the transformations are intricate, making the **Dao/Way** dim.

The **Celestial Sovereign’s** seventeen radiance lights are like the **Buddha’s** manifestation of the **Dharmakāya** (丈六身), with the crown emitting the **Great Auspicious Radiance**. Moreover, the **Celestial Sovereign’s** radiance is supremely wondrous, transcending all kinds. Who can trace the wondrous deeds or recognize the seventeen great meanings?

Alas, this is rare and difficult to attain! The **Dao/Way** is inherently within oneself; neglect leads to dimness, while diligence brings clarity. Cultivate the **Way** of **non-action** (无为) with steadfast effort, and do not seek swift **god-transcending** transformations. The **Dao/Way** will naturally be obtained.

Thus, the thirty-second chapter of the **God-Transcending** section states: Therefore, you mortals who desire to see the **Celestial Sovereign** yet cannot do so, it is because you still cling to the **body** and **mouth** (身口), failing to abandon your **karmic habits** (结习). Your **afflictions** and deeds are ever-present.

Because of these obstructions, you cannot behold the **Celestial Sovereign’s** compassionate visage. Now, I proclaim the **Dharma** of breaking through these obstructions for you, the assembly of the **Dharma**. You, the great assembly, should each earnestly follow this.

At that time, all the great assembly rejoiced and leapt for joy, bowing their heads before the **Highest Venerable One** (至尊) and the **mortal** (凡) alike, all desiring to hear the teachings.

The **Thunder Sage** (雷师), **Bright Old Man** (皓翁), said: The **Celestial Sovereign** emits seventeen great radiance lights, transcending all measure. Therefore, you lofty, pure, and clear **Celestial Sovereigns** and **masters of the heavens** (高虚清明天主等), who desire to truly see the **Celestial Sovereign** yet cannot do so, it is because though you have no dusty stains, you have not yet attained the station of the **Celestial Sovereign**. The **Great Vehicle** (大乘) of supreme wondrousness has not been truly understood.

You still cling to the **body** and **mouth** (身口), failing to abandon **karmic habits** from countless eons, **ignorance** and **afflictions**, **mortal** deeds and transgressions. Because of these obstructions, you cannot behold the **Celestial Sovereign’s** compassionate visage.

**Karmic habits** (结习), **emotional desires**, and dusty **mortal** things: all delusions and entanglements are fundamentally not to be coveted. Yet due to insufficient wisdom and excessive attachment to thoughts, the rise of perceptions leads to gradual staining and clinging. Interacting with things and beings, these entanglements grow ever deeper, forming **karmic toxins** (结毒) that solidify into **habits** (习气).

Like a man binding himself with ropes, it is difficult to untangle in a moment. Deep-rooted **karmic habits** and past stains are hard to remove once they have taken hold. The **karmic seeds** and **roots of deeds** are inherently impure; clinging to **mortal** desires may either harbor **afflictions** or accumulate transgressions, or plant **karmic seeds**, entangling one in endless **karma**, restless and chaotic. The **afflictions** and disturbances have not yet been dispelled, and the **karmic deeds** of past lives continue to obstruct.

Even though you govern the **Brahma realms** (梵天), you have not yet attained ultimate clarity, nor do you fully comprehend the **Heavenly Mysteries** (重玄). How could you then behold the most supreme **Celestial Sovereign**? This is why you cannot see the **Celestial Sovereign**.

Now I proclaim to you, the gathered assembly, the method for cutting through and removing obstructions. You, the great assembly, should each uphold and practice it with sincerity.

At that time, the great assembly, overcome with joy and exultation, all knelt before the **Celestial Sovereign’s** jade case, bowing their heads and prostrating, reverently offering their respects, all desiring to hear the secret discourse on dispelling obstructions.

*"I"* refers to **Primordial Beginning** (元始), *"case"* (几) means *"table."* A note: From birth, each has inherent predispositions. Though the **Great Cycle** (元会) begins anew and the **Great Harmony qi** (太和之气) flows, the accumulated habits of past eons are not easily forgotten. Thus, the scriptures liken predestined **karmic affinities** to accumulated toxins—a true insight.

Therefore, those with **affinities for joy** will find kindred hearts across distant realms, while those bound by **malevolent affinities** may stand face-to-face yet remain a thousand miles apart. Do not dismiss the *Dao Canon*’s **functional frameworks** or Buddhist scriptural records as heretical—even in Confucian texts, Yan Ying’s opposition to Confucius was later attributed to **fate’s decree**. The great scholars Cheng Yi and Su Shi split into the **Shu** and **Lu factions**, another case of **incompatible affinities**. Yet even those who must rely on one another often meet with estrangement—a lament shared across ages. Can the doctrine of **affinities** then be entirely discarded?

Thus, the **Ten Perceptions** are inexhaustible, the **Five Aggregates** unfathomable, the **Thirteen Disciples** and **Twenty-Five Magical Seeds** endless, the **Seven False and Three True** transformations intricate—who can easily escape them all?

The **Celestial Sovereign**, having attained the **Pure and Bright Heavenly Lord’s** imperial throne, though freed from earthly defilements, still bears the **accumulated karma of past kalpas**, not yet fully transcended. His essence lingers in the **lofty void**, known as **Pure and Bright**. Past virtuous causes remain untouched by the **void’s embrace**. How could one who embodies **Void-Luminous Perfection** like the **Celestial Sovereign** be seen at once?

The Buddhist scriptures note that even **Bodhisattvas**, in their practice, may see the face of the **Tathāgata** yet fail to truly behold him. When the **Dharma-body Buddha** expounds the **supreme truth**, the Bodhisattvas listen in silence—this is the same principle. The **Most Sage** is not easily seen; the obstructions of **body and speech habits** are not easily dispelled.

Yet this truth is most difficult to grasp. To *"see"* the **Celestial Sovereign** is not to see him with the eyes; to **comprehend** his **Way** is to **penetrate** his **virtue**. As in Confucius’ door—those who truly receive the **Master’s transmission of the heart-mind**, one in essence—though times and worlds differ, the principle remains the same. **Spiritual communion** and **heart-meeting** alone yield true vision.

Even **Yan Hui**, the bright and discerning disciple, failed to grasp the **subtle interval**; how then could the **Pure and Bright Heavenly Lord** see the **Celestial Sovereign**, and why doubt it?

The **Primordial Beginning’s** method of **breaking through obstructions** lies in **luminous predestined practice**, **penetrating the heart’s essence**, and **repelling and harmonizing**—once the outer obstructions dissolve, the **Celestial Sovereign** is seen. Thus, the assembly longs to hear it.

Alas! Obstructions arise from the heart; breaking them depends on the **self**. The **Great Unimpeded Way** is within your **original spirit**—do not grow weary in crossing. **Coarse traces of speech and hearing** should not become hindrances. Is the **Great Dao** not within you? Strive onward.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Perfection of Spiritual Penetration**
The **Celestial Worthy** spoke: *"The method of cutting through obstructions lies in generating **great wisdom**, free from doubt, free from **greed and anger**, free from **lustful desires**, free from **envy and jealousy**, free from **harm and killing**, free from **mundane emotions**, free from **mundane thoughts**, free from **delusion and filth**, free from **sounds and colors**, free from **right and wrong**, free from **hatred and love**, free from **discrimination**, free from **arrogance**, free from **attachment**."*

**Master Guangcheng** said: *"The **Primordial Beginning Celestial Worthy**, responding to the Pure Assembly’s request for the **mystery of unobstructed perfection**, spoke thus: To cut through obstructions and behold the **Celestial Sovereign’s** wondrous transformation and luminous visage, the **Way** is none other than generating **divine wisdom and great enlightenment**, firmly believing in the **True Path**, free from **doubt, wavering, and confusion**. The **Great Dao** is supremely upright; **True Unity** admits no duality—there is nothing to doubt or confuse.

If **clarity** is insufficient to discern the **subtle signs**, one may cling to **contradictory extremes**, lacking steadfast vision, and **demonic knowledge** seizes the opportunity. Once one knows the **Great Dao** resides within, **knowing and guarding firmly**, do not waver with **duality**, nor mix with **triplicity**—what more is there to doubt? Without doubt, there is no confusion; the **Dao** can be entered.

Thus, the **great wisdom** that cuts through obstructions and purifies **accumulated habits** must first be free from doubt. Seekers of the **Way** must not measure progress by **worldly gains**, nor rely on external means. **Anger, resentment, indignation, and grievance** must all be abandoned.

The second obstruction to cut: **greed and anger**. Let the mind be **single-minded in the Dao**; its sincerity will follow naturally. **Nurturing private desires** and **wandering thoughts** easily arise—even a hair’s breadth of **lewd indulgence or craving** greatly disturbs the **True**.

The third obstruction: **lustful desires**. The **Dao** encompasses all; the **virtuous and unworthy** are both my teachers. If you harbor the slightest **resentment toward the capable** or **disdain for the foolish**, it is a grave error.

The fourth obstruction: **envy and jealousy**. The **Great Dao** is supremely compassionate, **unbearingly tolerant**. If, out of **hostility or malice**, you nurture **destructive intentions**, you stray far from the **Way**.

The fifth obstruction: **harm and killing**. Though the *Yin-Xing Classic* speaks of **"killing the mechanism"**, it means subduing **evil demons** so that **ultimate truth** may act freely. As in **autumn’s killing frost**, when plants return to the roots and **life’s vitality withdraws**, one sees the **compassion of Heaven and Earth**—this is not the **world’s** notion of killing. It is also said: *"Harm gives rise to kindness."* This reflects the **mind-intent of Heaven and Earth**, not the **world’s** notion of harm.

The **Great Dao** acts without action; **emotions and perceptions** are not employed. A single **mundane impulse** leads to boundless error.

The sixth obstruction: **mundane emotions**. The **Dao’s intent** requires **pure thoughts**. Any **dust-thought** brings boundless ruin.

The seventh obstruction: **mundane thoughts**. The **Dao** is **unblemished purity**; the slightest **delusion or filth** betrays the **ultimate truth**.

The eighth obstruction: **sounds and colors**. To seek the **Dao** through them is to distance oneself from it. Those who embody the **Dao** do not merely avoid **external sounds and colors**—they remain untouched by the **world**, standing beyond the **Dao’s ripples and shores**, seeking and clinging to nothing.

The ninth obstruction to be severed: **no arising of sounds and colors**.

The **Dao** is **Great Unity** in its essence. The slightest affirmation or negation betrays its **original true nature**.

The tenth obstruction: **no arising of right and wrong**. Though Mencius says, *"The mind of right and wrong, all people possess,"*—**great wisdom** is like **foolishness**; why would one cling to distinctions of right and wrong?

The **Dao** knows no preference or rejection. Love or hatred obstructs the **true**.

The eleventh obstruction: **no arising of hatred or love**. The **principle** is **without duality**; applying **discriminating intelligence** is not the **Dao**.

The twelfth method of severing obstructions: **no arising of distinctions**. Seeing the **Dao** clearly, transcending the **mundane**, disdaining worldly affairs—**arrogance** greatly violates the **Way**.

The thirteenth method of severing obstructions: **no arising of prideful or contemptuous thoughts**.

The **Dao** is **lively and boundless**; its **ultimate essence** cannot be grasped. Severing the thirteen obstructions, the **Dao** is attained. Though called *"attainment of the Dao,"* in truth, there is nothing to attain. If one clings to any **fixed possession**, the **principle** remains obstructed, bound by **dharma**.

The fourteenth and final method of severing obstructions: **no arising of attachment**.

**My humble reflection**: The **Dao** in humanity is **innately unobstructed**. Only when **worldly affairs and discriminating thoughts** veil it does one lose the **Way**. Thus, the **Primordial Origin** compassionately instructs the *Gate of Severing Obstructions* to the **Pure Assembly**, enumerating all obstacles, urging all to **resolutely aspire** and not be hindered by difficulties. To break free from **worldly obstructions** and transcend **dharma’s confines**, then the **Jade Emperor’s divine radiance** will reveal itself—**my wondrous essence** will shine forth, and **Yue** will see it clearly. Though so, severing these two obstructions opens the **Dao’s gate**. The **Divine Transformation** and **Mysterious Depths** are yet to be expounded in later teachings.

**Chapter on the Divine Passages (34th Chapter)**:
Concentrate the **divine essence**, clarify the **thoughts**—all **spirits** are subdued. The **heart** becomes **Primordial Void**, **inner and outer** untainted and pure, containing all without exclusion, accepting all without reservation. Do not allow **external evils** to disturb your **Supreme Dao**, drag you away from the **True Principle**, ruin your **numinous root**, or steal your **Ultimate Treasure**, lest you fall into **endless mundane existence**, trapped in the **world’s net**, assailed by **ten thousand demons**, and for **hundreds of thousands of kalpas** hear no **wondrous dharma**, while **ghosts and spirits** seize the chance to condemn you, from birth into death.

Thus, you must **resolutely cultivate**, safeguard the **True Principle**, and never let it be lost. As previously stated, all these obstructions must be **severed by you**. With **body pure and thoughts clear**, you transcend all **difficulties**—this is the **Dao’s Treasure**, the **pillar of upholding the Law**.

Liu Haichan says: *"The Primordial Origin teaches the method of severing obstructions; it generates **great wisdom** and cuts off the **fourteen paths of karmic inclination**."* What is its **ultimate fruition**?

Severing obstructions and removing veils, **divine clarity** and **pure thoughts** arise. **Silently dwell** in the **Primordial Spirit** and **Mysterious Origin**, **concentrate the Primordial Spirit**, and **clarify all thoughts**—all **spirits** harmonize and **submerge**. The **heart** is like **endless void**, **inner and outer** steadfast, pure, and white. All **mundane dharmas** and **living beings** are contained without limit, embraced without exclusion.

Moreover, **fix the vision and guard it firmly**, never wavering—do not let **external evils** confuse your **Supreme Rectitude** and **Great Dao**, nor drag you away from the **True Primordial Principle**, lest you ruin your **Ultimate Numinous Root**, steal your **inherent, unshareable, indestructible Treasure**, and cause you to **accumulate kalpas** in **endless mundane existence**, sinking deep into the **net of worldly dust**, with **demonic afflictions** relentlessly assaulting you. For **hundreds of thousands of kalpas**, you will be ensnared by **demonic deeds**, hearing no **Supreme True Wondrous Law**, while **ghosts and spirits** seize the opportunity to **condemn and slay** you, from birth into death.

Thus, you **Law Assembly** must **sincerely resolve**, **self-protect the innate True Principle**, and never let it be **lost or abandoned**. As previously stated, all **doubts and obstructions** must be **exterminated and severed**. The **fourteen obstructions**, including **external evils**, **birth and death**, and **mundane inclinations**, are all encompassed within.

Once all obstructions are **severed and cut off**, the **body attains true purity and clarity**, transcending the **three realms’ karmic cycles** and **sufferings**. This is the **method of severing obstructions**—the **Dao’s Ultimate Treasure**, the **great pillar supporting the True Law**.

Temples, halls, pagodas, palaces, gates, and dwellings—without **pillars and beams**, their construction is difficult. Cultivating the **Dao** to **perfection**, entering **sainthood** and transcending **mundanity**—without **severing obstructions**, liberation is impossible. Severing all obstructions ensures **eternal freedom from ruin**, and the **True Law** flourishes.

Thus, the **Celestial Sovereign** regards **severing obstructions** as the **pillar upholding the Law**.

**My humble reflection**: Humanity’s **inherent true nature** and **Primordial Spirit** are **pure and untainted**, **unbroken through kalpas**, naturally **serene and content**, and **never cease to be luminous**, undivided from **sainthood and truth**. If **clarity** persists without end, how could the **Jade Emperor’s divine transformation** and **wondrous light** not be **witnessed clearly**?

Yet, **thoughts** cling to the **heart**, perpetuating and unchanging. Those who **slightly understand the Dao** still hope for **rapid results**, so **deep-seated habits** linger, **afflictions** persist, and the **Imperial Light** remains unseen. If **true enlightenment** and **mysterious penetration** are **perfectly achieved**, the **ultimate fruit** is **unshakable**—knowing **nature and life** as **true**, recognizing **all things** as **illusionary**, one **sees the Dao** and **forgets things**, then **walks the Dao** and **forgets people**, **attains the Dao** and **forgets self**, **completes the Dao** and **forgets the heart**, and **delights in the Dao** and **forgets inclinations**.

Then, **forgetting forgets to forget the true**, **affairs and principles merge**, **true and false are both abandoned**, neither clinging to **sainthood nor mundanity**, nor needing **five ranks of masters and disciples**. **Attainment without attainment**, **guardianship without clinging**, **emptiness yet not empty**, **not divine yet divine**—then **ancient habits are purified**, **accumulated karmas vanish**, **subtle defilements are extinguished**, and one **enters the Supreme**. No longer **drifting in silence** toward the **Celestial Emperor**, sharing **divine essence**; no longer **ringing the bell** of the **Dao’s natural law**, merging with **true principle**—what need is there for **three vehicles** or **all teachings**? The **most exalted in sainthood**, whose **virtues** are **unparalleled**?

All can **achieve it**—only the **purity of root and dust**, the **perfection of mysterious practice**, and the **wondrousness of effortless action** matter. **No doing, no questioning**.

「The rigid and false cannot truly escape; yet the fusion is not yet complete, nor the transformation divine—still, one has not fully attained sainthood. Only those who have transcended the **Daoist** *Xuanzhong* **Earthly Immortal**, the **Buddhist** *Phosat* **Bodhisattva**, and the **Confucian** *Daxian* **Great Sage** and above can achieve this.

Now, mortals seeking the **Dao/Way**, still adhere to the **Most Exalted in Sainthood** (至聖), not deeming the **Great Vehicle** (大乘) as sufficient. In the **Thirty-Fifth Chapter of Divine Powers** (神通品三十五章), you must further cultivate and revere this sacred text, as if standing before the **Celestial Emperor** (玉皇尊帝). Nurture a heart of reverence and awe, focus your contemplation on the **Emperor’s Noble Form** (尊容), and proclaim the **Emperor’s Glorious Titles** (尊號). Only then will you behold the **Compassionate Face** (慈颜), all receive the **Emperor’s Protection and Liberation** (護度), universally hear the **Wondrous Law** (妙法), and personally offer **Devoted Reverence and Sustenance** (祗奉供養), forever free from **rebirth’s cycles** (輪轉).

**Eastern Hua Wood Official** (东华木公) declared: *"The **Primordial Beginning** (元始) revealed to the multitudes the Law of Severing Obstacles (断障之法), which, being called the **Dao/Way’s Treasure** (道寶) and the **Pillar of the Law** (持法栋梁), was further demonstrated to all as the **Enduring Practice and Devotion** (持久服膺之義). You, the **Pure Assembly** (清眾), having heard the **True Teaching** (正法) today, must further uphold and revere this *Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct Scripture* (《玉皇本行經》). By personally reciting this scripture, you stand near the **Jade Emperor’s Noble Sovereign** (玉皇尊帝), generating a heart of **reverence and safeguarding** (尊敬保重).

Knowing the **Noble Scripture** (尊經) prevents profaning the **Dao’s Natural Law** (天道); honoring the **Scripture** (重經) prevents belittling the **Dao’s Treasure** (天寶). Eternal reverence ensures no **disrespect or negligence** (悖慢), and the **Great Dao/Way** is naturally attained.

This aligns with the *Analects* (《論語》) saying: *"Revere the **Heavenly Mandate** (天命), and revere the words of the **Sage** (聖人)."* Yet, to stand near the **Emperor** (是帝) is not to truly behold the **Celestial Sovereign** (玉帝); if one cannot yet **cross over and meet** (對越) the **Emperor**, then one cannot yet generate **true reverence** (尊重).

Focusing one’s attention and contemplating the **Emperor’s Noble Form and Wondrous Aspect** (尊容妙相) is not merely an act of **imagination** (想像). It is as if the **Emperor** were truly present—then, **devotedly serving the Celestial Sovereign** (昭事上帝), one **unites in virtue with Heaven and Earth** (與天地合德) and becomes the **Most Exalted in Sainthood** (至聖).

By proclaiming and extolling the **Emperor’s Most Noble Titles** (至尊徽號), you will behold the **Celestial Sovereign’s Great Compassionate Radiance** (玉帝大慈光颜), all receiving the **Emperor’s Protection and Liberation** (護持拔度), universally hearing the **Supreme True Wondrous Law** (無上至真妙法), and personally offering **Devoted Reverence and Sustenance** (祗奉供養) to the **Emperor** (是帝) and the **Scripture** (是經), forever free from **rebirth’s cycles and decline** (輪灭轉移之失).

Another teaching says: *"Seeing this sacred text, hearing this wondrous law, and beholding the **Emperor’s Face** (是帝颜), if one can personally and sincerely uphold and offer **reverence and sustenance** (崇奉供養), then one will forever escape the **mundane and profane** (尘凡), free from the **sufferings of rebirth and transmigration** (輪回轉生之苦)."* A deeper interpretation suggests that the **heart is forever steadfast**, and this is even more profound.

**Doubting Examination** (考疑) states: *"Confucian texts say, the **Divine** (神) cannot be summoned by mere thought. **Daoist** scriptures say, **Divine Transformation** (神化) requires no contrivance—it follows **Nature** (自然). **Buddhist** scriptures say, if one seeks the **Tathagata** (如來) through **form** (色) or **sound** (音声), one has strayed onto the **erroneous path** (邪道) and cannot behold the **Tathagata**. Yet today it is said: focus your contemplation on the **Emperor’s Noble Form** (尊容), proclaim the **Emperor’s Titles** (尊號), and then you will behold the **Compassionate Face** (慈颜).*

Does the **Primordial Beginning’s Mysterious Ancestor** (元始玄祖) deceive us? These words are not mere **fantasy or stagnant musings** (意想思存), nor are they **trapped in sensory traces** (滞迹口耳). To **unify in virtue with Heaven** (合德於天) and **inspire divine trust in the Emperor** (孚神於帝), to **blend and forget in transformation** (浑化相忘)—thus the ancients said: *"The **Heavenly威** (威) does not contradict the **Emperor’s Face** (玉帝颜), even at a distance of inches."* Through **reverent devotion and transformation** (敬恭而化), one naturally reaches the **ultimate praise**.

This is as the Confucian texts say: *"Speak the words of **Emperor Yao** (尧), and act in the manner of **Emperor Yao**—then you are **Emperor Yao**."* As the **Buddhist** teachings say: *"The **Dharmakaya** (法身) enters my **nature** (性), and my **nature** unites with the **Tathagata’s** (如來) **true principle** (真)."* And as the **Daoist** scriptures say: *"The **Divine** (神) merges with the **Dao/Way** (道), and the **Dao/Way** becomes one with the body."* Only thus can one **hear the wondrous law** (聞妙法), **offer reverence and sustenance** (奉供養), and be **forever free from rebirth’s cycles** (無輪轉).

If one merely **stores thoughts in the heart** (心存想) and **proclaims with the mouth** (口稱扬), yet cannot **submit one’s body** (皈身) or **submit one’s divine mandate** (皈神命), nor **converge in darkness with the Dao** (冥心會道), then this cannot be called **true reverence and sustenance** (真供養), and how can one **avoid rebirth’s cycles** (焉得無輪轉)?

The **uttermost perfection** (至無毁沦) and **unending steadfastness** (不迁转) prove that **contemplation, proclamation, and sustenance** (注想、稱揚、供養) transcend the **ordinary world’s understanding** (世俗之謂).

**Foolish Reflection** (愚按) states: *"All mortals possess **life and destiny** (性命) from **Heaven** (天), yet they fall into the **profane currents** (俗流) and thus are bound by **rebirth’s cycles** (輪轉). If one **masterminds the great Dao/Way** (經綸天下之大經) and **fulfills its nature** (能盡其性), then one truly **cultivates and reveres the Jade Emperor’s Scripture** (修奉玉帝經典); if one **crosses over and meets the Emperor in Heaven** (能對越在天), then it is as if one **stood near the Emperor** (即如近是帝). With **a humble and cautious heart** (小心翼翼), **devotedly serving without deviation** (祗事不違), one generates **true reverence** (生尊重心). The **body acts as Heaven’s work** (身代天工), the **mouth speaks as Heaven’s voice** (口代天言), **following Heaven without self-interest** (法天不私), and the **Emperor’s True Principle** (帝真) is **naturally present** (時御).

This is the **contemplation of the Jade Emperor’s Form** (想玉帝容), the **proclamation of the Emperor’s Titles** (稱帝號), and the **attainment of the Emperor’s Radiance** (得绪帝颜). **Virtue is singular** (德惟一), and **all actions are auspicious** (動罔不吉). **Exhausting oneself, exhausting others, exhausting all things** (盡己、盡人、盡物), **participating in the transformation and nurturing of all** (參贊化育), **submitting to destiny and sincerely surrendering** (皈命投誠), **embodying the form with utmost fidelity** (践形惟肖)—**supreme sincerity knows no cessation** (至誠無息), **eternal and boundless** (悠久無疆)—thus all receive **the Emperor’s Protection** (護度), universally hear the **Wondrous Law** (妙法), and personally offer **reverence and sustenance** (親奉供養), forever free from **rebirth’s cycles** (永無輪轉).

Ah! **The Dao/Way** in mortals must be **piercing and unbroken** (突不離). **The Dao/Way** has its **scriptures** (經), as **walking has its paths** (行有路). To **tread its full circuit** (践彼周行), how can one who walks the **Dao/Way** (行道者) not follow this path? **Confucius** had no **other way** (何莫由道) to deceive. The **Primordial Beginning** (元始) spoke truly: *"The profane cannot behold the Emperor"* (凡流不能見帝). If one **truly grasps this scripture** (果味是經), one **stands equal with the Jade Emperor** (自與玉帝齐肩).

In the **Thirty-Sixth Chapter of Divine Powers** (神通品三十六章), at that time, the **Fourfold Assembly** (四眾) heard these words and **rejoiced, leaping in delight** (歡喜躍跃), exclaiming that such had never been heard before. The **Grand Celestial Official** (天官大帝) declared: *"At the assembly of the Jade Scripture’s Law (玉經時), the Fourfold Assembly (法會四眾) heard the **Primordial Beginning’s Daoist Ancestor** (元始道祖) expound the *Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct Scripture* (《玉皇本行集經》), specifically the **Thirty-Fifth Chapter of Divine Powers in the Pure and Mysterious Celestial Palace** (□清微天宮神通品卷分已竟).*

They heard of the **Emperor’s extraordinary birth** (生長之奇异), the **accumulation of merits across countless ages** (多世之修因), the **limitless transformations** (變化之無量), the **inexhaustible virtues** (功德之難窮), the **natural divine responses** (神應之自然), and the **greatest of laws** (法之最大). The **attendants and guards, Jade Maidens** (侍衛玉女), **emanated from Heaven’s True Nature** (化自天真). The **boundaries of the sands** (沙界) and the **vast calamities** (浩劫) were all **relied upon by this scripture and law** (悉賴經法). They **understood the causes of crime and blessing** (明罪福之緣由) and **listened to the wondrous intent of severing obstacles** (聆斷障之妙旨).

The **Seventeen Great Radiant Lights** (十七大光明) have their **foundations** (洞之有基); the **countless eons of cultivating truth** (億萬劫修真) have their **key principles** (述之有要). **Taking the law as one’s own** (取法自在) makes **entering sainthood effortless** (入聖無難). They rejoiced at **escaping the mundane karmic burdens** (慶塵業之已脫) and **easily entering the Seven Realms** (幸七所之易入), all filled with **joy and delight** (悉皆歡悅喜樂), **exultant and leaping** (忻腾躍跃), **in unison praising** (同聲稱讚).

The present gathering of the **Law Assembly** (法会) is a **most auspicious and supreme opportunity** (良缘最胜), a **rare and extraordinary encounter** (奇逢非偶). This assembly, this teaching—**this is the Emperor, this is the Scripture** (此会此闻，是帝是经)—this moment, this instruction (兹时兹训) are **unprecedented since the eons** (历劫以来未曾有也).

Some say, *"Hearing the saying ‘already finished’"* (闻是说已) refers **solely to the method of severing the battle-array** (断阵之法), which is **too restrictive**. When the **Primordial Dao Ancestor** (元始道祖) expounded the Scripture, the *Chapter on Divine Powers* (《神通品》) was **already completed** (说已竟), not something spoken after another discourse.

Though divided into **three volumes and five chapters** (三卷五品), the **Divine Instruction** (慈训) was **demonstrated in accordance with its categories**, so the **Heavenly True Ones** (天真) **recited the Scripture in three volumes** (演经列三卷耳). If one were to interpret the **concluding volume’s expressions of praise** (终卷称叹) as mere **ordinary exclamations** (他叹言), it would be **incomplete understanding**.

Thus, *"hearing the saying ‘already finished’"* (闻是说已) must **comprehensively embrace the preceding discourse**. Let the **readers of the Scripture** (看经者) **examine this carefully**.

**My humble observation:** The **human body’s spirit, qi, blood, and vitality** (人身精神气血) **obey the Heavenly Sovereign** (听命天君). The **wondrous mind** (妙心) is **penetrating and clear** (洞然), the **Heavenly Resonance** (天籁) **emits sound**, the **mind is serene and harmonious** (怡然理顺), the **Great Harmony** (太和) **naturally arises** (油然), hands dance, feet leap—**joy knows no bounds** (快乐无方). **Obtaining the Dao, one forgets artifice** (得道忘机), surpassing all in the world (举世莫尚).

Even the **fourfold assembly of the body** (身亦有四众), upon hearing the teaching, **rejoice and leap in exultation** (欢喜踊跃), **as though they had never before experienced such wonder** (欺未曾有之义也). Yet the world is **immersed in greed and desire** (溺利欲), few **awaken to true understanding** (了悟无人). To **enter sainthood and attain Truehood** (入圣成真) is **rarely seen** (不数见耳).

If one **hears the Scripture in silent resonance** (闻经默会), the **body embodies Great Harmony** (身具太和), the **mind merges with spiritual transformation** (心融神化), then **is the Emperor’s achievement not within oneself?** (帝功不在我乎?)

**Commentary on the First Volume’s Chapter Divisions**
The **Primordial Heavenly Venerable** (元始天尊) expounded the *Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct* (《玉皇本行集经》). The **Heavenly True Ones** (诸天真) requested an explanation of the **roots of the Emperor’s transformations** (帝化根由). Though their questions varied, they were all **posed at one time** (皆在一时), so **how did the first volume come to be divided into thirty-six chapters?** (如何首卷分三十六章?)

The Scripture was **indeed delivered in one sitting** (说经固在一时), yet **each question elicited a distinct response** (因问以答，各有不同). Later generations **failed to grasp the Scripture’s essence and intent** (不能明经旨趣), **penetrating the profound instructions of the Most Holy** (洞至圣玄训), hence the **Heavenly True Ones, Imperial Gods, and Five Elders** (诸天帝神真、五老帝君) **recorded and annotated beforehand**, while **Heavenly Yóu** (天猷) **compiled and arranged afterward**.

The **Imperial Duke of Literature** (文昌帝君) and **Heavenly Pivot Marshal** (天枢上相) **each, in their time, deliberated and corrected**, thus **designating the first section as *The First Chapter: Divine Powers of the Pure Bright Heavenly Palace*** (首分系曰《清微天宫神通品第一》), without further division, for the **Emperor’s divine powers are unparalleled** (帝神通无伦), **supreme and unexcelled** (其居无上).

The **Primordial Instruction** (元始此训) is **beyond the speech of all immortals and Buddhas** (诸仙佛不能言也). **Bo Yang of the Han-Wei era, Lü Chunyang of the Tang, Qiu Changchun of the Yuan, and Luo Pengan of the Ming** (汉魏伯阳、唐吕纯阳、元丘长春、明罗念庵) **commented on it in great detail**, dividing it into chapters with annotations. Thus, the **first volume’s *Chapter on Divine Powers*** (首卷《神通品》) **comprises thirty-six chapters** (得三十六章).

This was **not a frivolous dissection of True Speech** (非轻析真语), but rather **a structured division** (故使支分), **aligned with the thirty-six heavens** (从三十六天之义以立章). Moreover, **each division carries profound intent** (截处有旨), the **meanings flow in continuity** (意相统承), **without scattering or dispersing**.

If the **reciter or observer** (观诵者) **clears the mind and purges distractions** (澄心涤虑), **embodying the Most Holy’s intent in expounding the Scripture** (以体至圣说经之意) and the **uppermost True Ones’ purpose in dividing the chapters** (上真分章之趣), **striving to harmonize one’s spirit with the Holy True Ones** (务使神与圣真相孚), then **the Scripture’s vital essence will flow uninterrupted** (会经血脉贯串). Then, **what division remains among the thirty-six chapters?** (则三十六章又何分?) **How could the Scripture’s intent not be attained?** (说经之旨又岂不可得哉?)

Yet **many are mired in the letter** (泥文者多), **few attain silent comprehension** (默识不厌者寡). Some **deem the Scripture useless** (或以经为无益), others **treasure a single phrase as extraordinary** (或得一句以为奇), still others **fixate on a single character as flaw** (或执一字以为病). They **distinguish between the *Lingbao* and *Gaoshang* schools** (别灵宝、高上之名), **lacking the mind to listen to the divine resonance’s marvel** (无心聆神会之妙), thus **failing to awaken to the Dao through the Scripture**, instead **becoming ensnared by textual dogmatism** (反为文字障执), **deepening confusion** (又惑之甚者也).

Alas! **All Scriptures contain supreme utterances** (诸经至语), **each a seal of the heart** (皆为心印). **Through the text, the Dao is glimpsed** (因文见道); **obtaining the Dao, one transcends words** (得道忘言). The **mysterious celestial treatises** (玄穹秘论) are **already the inherent threads of my own being** (悉我固有经纶). **Why doubt its accessibility**, to the point of **lightly slandering it?** (又何疑其难入，至於轻谤) **How fortunate for those who attain even a single insight!** (一得辄幸哉?)

**These concluding remarks** (赘此首末) are **a warning to scholars** (学者戒之).

**The Imperial Scripture’s Annotated Commentary, Volume Four**
**Conclusion of the First Volume’s Thirty-Six Chapters**
**Imperial Scripture’s Compiled Commentary, Volume Five**

The **Grandmaster of the Dao** (嗣汉五十代天师), the **Great True Person Zhang Guoxiang** (大真人张国祥), edited;
the **Confucian scholar and recluse** (状元方外隐), **Master Luo Hongxian of Jixi** (江西吉水罗洪先), reviewed;
**Little Zhao Master Zhou Xuan** (小兆臣周玄贞) of **Jinan, Shandong**, compiled;
**The Original Scripture of the Highest Celestial Jade Emperor** (高上玉皇本行集经), **Volume Middle** (卷中).
**End of the Upper Volume** (右上卷《神通品》至圣天官妙化).

The **Three Teachings’** (三教) **saints and true persons** (圣真) are all beyond comparison—
thus, it is placed first, revealing the **divine transformation** (神化) of this **true Scripture** (真经).
This **chapter** (品) first enumerates the **Scripture of Divine Spells** (《神咒品》),
for it contains **secret laws** (秘法语) within the Scripture.
Those who can **transcend mortals and record immortals** (度人录仙),
**control the stars** (制星), **subdue demons** (制魔), **command water** (制水),
**pacify the five directions** (镇五方), **benefit the dharma realm** (济法界),
are called **divine spells** (神咒).
If one possesses **divine powers** (神通) yet the **Scripture’s secret words** (法语秘文) remain unmanifested,
then its benefit is yet to be realized—
thus, it follows the **Scripture of Divine Powers** (神通) as the second chapter.

**Chapter One of the Scripture of Divine Spells** (神咒品第二)
**Chapter One of the Scripture of Divine Spells** (神咒品第一章):
*"At that time*, the **Primordial Sovereign of Heaven and Earth** (天地始祖),
the **Five Old Emperors of the Five Directions** (五老上帝),
prostrated themselves with long kneeling and respectfully addressed the **Heavenly Venerable** (天尊):
*'We humbly hear* that the **Highest Celestial Jade Emperor** (高上玉皇),
out of **compassionate concern** (慈念) for the **mortal masses** (苍生),
universally emits **limitless true divine light** (无量真光),
illuminating the **three-thousand great-thousand worlds** (三千大千),
all **heavens and earths** (诸天诸地), and the **entire dharma realm** (一切法界).
The **six classes of mortals** (六凡)—heavens, humans, demons, hells,
hungry ghosts, and beasts—
as well as the **supreme vehicle** (至最上一乘) and the **four grades of lesser vehicles** (上、中、下乘四等),
the **four saints** (四圣)—**immortals and true persons** (仙真), **Buddhas** (佛), **celestial beings** (神), and **virtuous scholars** (志士)—
all universally benefit from the **compassionate radiance of the Dao** (大道慈光), receiving its **protection** (荫庇).

*We humbly reflect*: though mortals are **short-lived** (不寿),
their **worldly existence is fleeting** (世景短促),
and the **dharma realm’s karmic cycle** (法界劫运) is nearing its end—
the **true path of immortals and sages** (仙真正道) should now be **propagated** (传行).
To **deliver countless beings** (济亿兆之民),
granting those who **aspire to immortality and Dao cultivation** (希仙修真之子)
a **chance to transcend** (脱之期),
so they may **lightly ascend** (轻身冲举),
and ensuring that the **mortal masses of the final age** (末代烝民) suffer no **untimely death** (夭折),
all attaining **longevity and respect** (寿考).

*For mortals in this world*, life has a **fixed measure** (定数),
and the **saints of the Three Teachings** (三教圣人) all **shed their mortal coils** (蜕骨).
**Master Yan Hui**, the **great sage** (大贤),
**passed away at thirty-two** (三十二岁而卒).
Though the **Imperial Scripture** (《皇经》) may offer **benefits** (利益),
how could it **defy the natural order** (违大造之数) and grant **eternal life** (长生)?
This is not so.
The **body may die** (身可死),
yet the **fundamental life principle** (生理) does not perish.
If one **does not comprehend the Dao** (道理不明),
though they **linger in this world** (生世上),
their **heart is already dead** (其心已死),
**clutching at a borrowed existence** (偷生苟免)—
what is such life worth calling **longevity** (寿)?
But if one **grasp the Dao** (明了道理),
**penetrates its truth** (悟彻行成),
and **returns to the void** (还虚脱化),
then even **dying in the evening after hearing it in the morning** (朝闻夕死)
leaves no **regret** (遗恨),
for this is **true longevity** (长生).
Thus, the *Dao De Jing* (《道德经》) says:
*'To die yet not perish is longevity'* (死而不亡者寿).
**Confucius** (孔子) says:
*'Human life is upright'* (人之生也直).
And again:
*'The virtuous live long'* (仁者寿).
The **Buddhist Scriptures** (释经) say:
*'If one attains **nirvana** (涅盘), they see the **Tathagata** (如来),
this is called the **unbreakable adamantine body** (金刚不坏).*

The **supreme masters of the Three Teachings** (三教至人)
do not regard **death as death** (不以死为死),
but **ignorance of the Dao as death** (以不明道为死);
nor do they consider **life as life** (不以生为生),
but **realization of the Dao as life** (以了道为生).
Though **natural fate** (造化之数) decrees that **no one escapes birth and death** (生死难逃),
it **binds ordinary people** (可拘常人)
yet **cannot constrain the saints** (而不可拘圣人).

The *Scripture of the Highest Celestial Jade Emperor* (《玉皇尊经》),
originating from **Primordial Beginning** (元始),
is the **supreme vehicle’s wondrous law** (最上一乘妙法),
the **true essence of the Three Teachings** (三教之真宗),
the **mystic key of all phenomena** (万法之玄诀),
the **compassionate vessel of the dharma realm** (法界之慈航),
the **critical pass of birth and death** (生死之要关),
the **secret meaning of arising, abiding, perishing, and voidness** (成住坏空之秘旨),
the **mechanism of the tilted kalpa** (倾劫之机括),
the **path to liberation and enlightenment** (超证坦途),
and the **wondrous chapter for worldly salvation** (度世妙品).
It is the **bridge across the karmic bonds and sins** (解结拔罪之津梁).

If the **Supreme Venerable** (至尊) **compassionately expounds** (慈演) this Scripture,
the **mortal masses** (烝民) will **once receive the saintly grace** (一蒙圣恩),
**inheriting the power of divine light** (承神光力),
all **returning to the true path** (皈依正法),
not straying into **erroneous ways** (不落邪径),
**unshamed before birth and death** (生死无愧),
and **granting longevity to those with short lives** (能令短命众生而得长寿).
Such is the **divine efficacy** (神功) of this Scripture.

**Protective resonance** (荫音), **imprint of truth** (印).
**Chong** (烝) is the same as **zheng** (蒸).

The **Final Age of the Ending Kalpa**

**Chapter Two: The Divine Incantations**

From ancient times, the *Elemental Origin: Mystic Cavern Treasure Scripture—The Scarlet Book of Jade Pages True Texts* emerged before the Elemental Origin, within the void, when heaven and earth had no roots, the sun and moon no radiance, in profound obscurity, without ancestor or lineage, without *qi* or form, without hue or name, without shape or thread, without sound or voice. In chaotic non-being, the numinous texts were dimly inscribed, neither clear nor obscure, appearing and vanishing. The numinous diagrams unfolded, the arcane symbols shifted, the refined *qi* ascended into the void, riding the mechanism of cosmic correspondence.

Thus did the **True Edicts of the Jade Emperor**, the **Secret Seals of the Treasure Scripture**, and the **Inconceivable Supreme Divine Incantations** take form.

The **Five Elderly Deities**, primordial ancestors of heaven and earth, spoke of the **True Dao of the Jade Emperor’s Scripture**, which could grant longevity to the mortal masses of the Final Age. How did such great efficacy arise?

From ancient times, the *Elemental Origin: Mystic Cavern Treasure Scripture—The Great Scarlet Celestial Book* and its **Jade-Lantern Jade Pages True Texts** emerged before the establishment of the *dharma*-realm, before the Elemental Origin’s primordial beginning, within the boundless void. Before the Two Principles had divided, before the Supreme Ultimate’s boundlessness, when heaven and earth lacked foundation, when yin and yang, water and fire had not yet conceived, before the sun and moon shone—amidst boundless murk, where distinctions were nonexistent, only profound obscurity remained.

Before the Ten Thousand Phenomena arose, who could claim precedence? No trace of cosmic transformation was visible—no ancestor, no lineage. In the boundless void, no *qi* was seen, no form existed, no color could be grasped, no name could be spoken, no shadow or outline remained, no echo or resonance endured. Vast and formless, where could sound or voice be found? In utter silence, the *Elemental Origin: Mystic Cavern Treasure Scripture—Scarlet Book of Jade Pages*’ true texts glimmered—dim yet not invisible, faint yet not entirely obscure, appearing and vanishing, neither purely existent nor purely nonexistent, neither having nor lacking, having yet not permanently having, lacking yet not permanently lacking.

Then the **Elemental Origin’s numinous diagrams** unfolded, the **Arcane Origin’s wondrous transformations** manifested, the **refined *dharma*-breath** ascended through the void, riding the **celestial mechanism**, responding to the auspicious convergence of heaven and humanity. The **Jade Emperor’s Sacred Decrees**, the **Treasure Scripture’s Secret Celestial Seals**, and the **Inconceivable Supreme Divine Incantations**—their boundless, unfathomable virtues thus revealed themselves in hidden forms, and the **wondrous *dharma* endured**.

The **Scarlet Book**, the **Jade Emperor’s True Scripture**, the **Texts of Marvelous Existence**, were all formed from the primordial *dharma*-breath of the celestial realms, their characters vast—one *zhang* in length—radiant crimson, the **Great Scarlet Gold Scriptures of the Azure Heaven**. Above the Nine Heavens lay the **Jade-Lantern Jade Pages** of the *Elemental Origin: Mystic Cavern Treasure Scripture*. With **precious clouds and jade moisture**, they were thus called the *Jade Pages*.

They emerged before the Elemental Origin, before heaven and earth’s primordial dawn—not before the Elemental Origin Lord. Before heaven and earth took root—not that heaven and earth lacked the power of transformation—they arose from the void. The **Elemental Origin’s true texts** existed before the Three Thousand Great Realms were established, before the vast kalpas, hence no trace of heaven and earth’s initial division was seen. They appeared and vanished, existing yet indefinable in form, vanishing yet never entirely extinguished in truth.

The **Jade Emperor’s True Words**, the **Imperial Scripture’s Marvelous Canon**, compassionately saved all without end, enduring through the vast kalpas, permeating the Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds yet never exhausted. The celestial realms revered them, the Three Teachings followed them—**the decrees of the tilted kalpa’s *dharma*-realm**.

The **Secret Seals of the Treasure Scripture**, the **Celestial Cloud Scriptures**, were not easily heard or seen, inconceivable, beyond thought or speech, beyond measure. Thus they endured.

The **True Texts of the Jade Scripture** existed before the vast kalpas—not newly arising today, but awaiting the auspicious convergence of mechanism and response. The **Dao** permeated the boundless void—what form did it take? Who could perceive it? Though it existed, none knew its existence. Now, as the **True Path should be practiced**, the numinous texts shine forth in hidden splendor, their divine efficacy radiant and manifest.

Thus it is said: *They endure*.

The **True Scripture’s wondrous *dharma*** manifests when the mechanism converges and the response aligns—**a rare and fortunate time**. Those present here, would they dare to presume upon themselves and not seek the *dharma*’s instruction?

**Chapter Three: The Divine Incantations**

Thus did heaven and earth obtain it and divide, the Three Luminaries obtain it and shine. The numinous texts flourished, illuminating the Mystic Cavern, emanating from the **First Azure Heaven**, their hues undefinable, their patterns winding, difficult to trace.

The **Elemental Origin** refined them in the **Mystic Yang Hall**, tempered them in the **Flowing Fire Courtyard**, their pristine sounds preceding the true texts, their radiance gleaming—**Mystic Yang’s *qi* was crimson**, hence the name *Scarlet Book*.

When the numinous diagrams blazed, the Five Emperors paid homage to the True One, soaring through the void, circling the Upper Palaces, burning incense and scattering flowers, reciting the sacred verses. At that time, the heavens displayed twelve arcane omens, the earth manifested twenty-four responses, celebrating the Nine Heavens’ numinous mysteries, praising the Three Heavens’ precious brilliance. The **divine winds blew**, the **Imperial Dao flourished**.

The **Elemental Origin** issued the decree, the **Supreme True One** took up the brush, the **Jade Consort** swept the table, casting gold into tablets, carving jade into scriptures. The Five Elders recorded them, hidden in the **Nine Heavens’ Mystic Capital Hall**. The **Jade Maidens** attended to the incense, the **Great Hua** held the towels, the **Golden Boys** stood guard, the **Jade Steps** faced the hall. The **Nine Heavens’ Jade Scriptures** were beyond the hearing of ghosts and spirits.

Only the **True Texts of the Jade Scripture** and the **Secret Seals of the Treasure Scripture** endured thus.

Therefore, the **Supreme Ultimate gave birth to the Two Principles**—the clear ascending as *Qian*, the turbid congealing as *Kun*—and heaven and earth obtained them and divided. The **Sun shone**, the **Moon displayed its luster**, the **stars arrayed themselves**, and the Three Luminaries obtained them and radiated light.

The **True Scriptures of the Sacred Texts** rise in lush splendor, their auspicious *qi* and refined essence radiant, piercing the **Upper Purity Realm** with boundless luminosity. They emanate from the **Most High Primordial Heaven**, their hue unbound by fixed direction or place.

The radiance of these Sacred Texts spreads in intricate, unfathomable brilliance, their splendor vast and winding, beyond measure or scrutiny. The **Primordial Beginning Venerable Sovereign** refined these True Texts within the **Cavernous Yang Triple Mystery Hall**, smelting this Scripture in the **Flowing Fire Great Brahman Court**, their pristine essence shining boundless. Their **Great True and Marvelous Texts** gleam with resplendent effulgence, their luminosity pure and ascending.

The **Cavernous Yang** refined *qi* overflows with crimson radiance, utterly vermilion—thus named the **Crimson Scripture**. The **Divine Movement of Mystic Diagrams** shines forth in splendor, and the **Five Emperors** ascended to the Primordial Court. The **Most True** rode celestial clouds, traversing the void, circling and paying homage to the **Supreme Celestial Palace**, burning the **Natural True Incense of Purity**, scattering heavenly flowers, and chanting the **Sacred Texts of Treasure Chapters** from their mouths.

At that time, Heaven did not hoard its Dao—**the Primordial Star** presented its omens, and Heaven revealed the **Twelve Mystic Auspices**; Earth did not conceal its treasures—**the Twenty-Four Breaths** manifested their pure signs, and Earth emitted the **Twenty-Four Responses**. Above, the **Nine Heavens’ Sacred Texts** were celebrated for their profound intent, and the **Three Heavens’ Treasure Chapters** were extolled in brilliance, their **Illuminating Marvelous Canons** spreading divine teachings far and wide.

When the **mechanism of salvation** was set in motion, the **Royal Dao flourished universally**, and the **Great Law benefited all**. The **Primordial Beginning** ascended the seat and bestowed command; the **Supreme True Immortal** took up the brush to inscribe, while the **Jade Maiden Sacred Consorts** swept the sacred platform. They cast **indestructible golden light** as **Mystic Strategies of Secret Tablets**, and carved **emerald-green mist** as **Crimson Scriptures**. The **Five Directions’ Five Spirits and Five Elders** oversaw their transmission, concealing them in the **Nine Heavens’ Most Sacred Mystic Capital Hall**. The **Jade Maidens** attended to the **Celestial Incense**, the **Great Hua True Person** held the **Mystic Towels**, the **Golden Boys** stood guard beside the **Jade Stairs**, and the **Jade Steps** faced the hall. The **Nine Heavens’ Jade Characters of Crimson Scripture**—unheard by all ghosts and spirits.

Only after Heaven and Earth came into being did **texts** emerge, transmitting the **Scriptures**. Now, when the **Imperial Scripture** is preserved, Heaven and Earth are divided. Men hearing this often doubt and fail to comprehend.

For the **Dao’s natural unfolding**, following its ceaseless course, becomes the **True Text**; the **Dao’s unbroken essence** becomes the **True Scripture**. Before the **Great Cataclysm**, the **Imperial Scripture’s principle** already existed. The **True Texts** have no characters; their **marvelous transformations** are inexhaustible. Thus, Heaven and Earth were divided from this point, and the **Three Luminaries** began to shine.

This is the **true reality**—what is there to doubt? The **text’s structure** is intricate. Those who use **characters as supporting strokes** are mistaken. Those who interpret **鲜 (xiān)** as **解 (jiě, "to explain")** are mistaken. Those who read it as **巽 (xùn, "gentle")** or **信 (xìn, "faith")** are mistaken. The **Mystic Scripture** has no form—why speak of **golden tablets**? The **Mystic Light’s marvelous symbols** endure beyond eons, hence **golden tablets and jade scriptures**. The **Mystic Text’s luminous auspices** are resplendent and dignified, hence **jade scriptures**. Ghosts and spirits cannot hear them.

The **Imperial Scripture’s** profound secrecy—ghosts and spirits do not recognize it, nor can ordinary hearing perceive it. Only those with **divine hearing** or **extraordinary hearing** may know it.

**Divine Incantations: Four Chapters**

Thus, Heaven treasures it to attain **purity**, Earth conceals it to attain **tranquility**, the **Five Emperors** wield it to attain **spiritual efficacy**, the **Three Luminaries** ride it to attain **elevated brilliance**, the **Supreme Sage** upholds it to attain **divine transcendence**, the **High Spirits** revere it to attain **True Sagacity**, the **Five Sacred Peaks** follow it to attain **stability**, and the **Son of Heaven** obtains it to attain **governance**. States rely on it to attain **peace**.

This is the **marvelous virtue of the Sacred Treasure**—the **Mystic Root of Heaven and Earth**. Its **mighty and boundless efficacy** benefits all without end, its **vast transformations** being the **source of divine illumination**. Its measure is unfathomable, towering in the **Great Void**.

At that time, the **Primordial Beginning** renewed the **Chaotic Cycle**, the **Mystic Symbols** unfolded, the **Sacred Texts** flourished in splendor, their divine manifestations marking the **Five Directions**, dividing Heaven and Earth, and enlightening all **lawful beings and categories**. This **Triple Mystery True Root Treasure**—may its **august teachings** be briefly unveiled in the **Sacred Repository**?

*—"加" (jiā) means "to benefit."*

The **Nine Heavens’ Jade Scripture Imperial Canon**—unheard by ghosts and spirits. The **Marvelous Law** is so difficult to hear that Heaven is exalted above, treasuring this **True Scripture** to attain **constant purity**. Earth is positioned below, guarding this **True Scripture** to attain **constant tranquility**. The **Five Directions’ Five Emperors** wield this **Secret Text** to achieve **spiritual efficacy** and become the **Five Spirits**. The **Sun, Moon, and Stars—Three Luminaries** ride this **True Scripture’s Marvelous Law**, elevating their suspended forms and shining brilliance. The **Supreme Sage and Perfected Ones** uphold this **True Scripture**, ascending to **incomprehensible sagacity and divine transcendence**. The **Divine Department** reveres this **True Scripture**, attaining the **position of True Sagacity**. The **Five Sacred Peaks and Holy Mountains**, through the power of this **True Scripture**, remain unshaken and attain **stability**. The **Son of Heaven**, ruling under Heaven, obtains this **Marvelous Law** to achieve **peaceful governance** across the **Four Seas**. States and dynasties rely on this **True Scripture** to ensure **political harmony and stability**.

This is the **marvelous virtue of the Sacred Treasure True Root**—the **True Root and Mystic Foundation of Heaven and Earth**. Its **heavenly威灵 (wēilíng, "awe and efficacy")** is vast and boundless, encompassing all **lawful realms**, benefiting all without measure. Its **vast transformations** are boundless and level, their functions formless yet without limit—truly the **infinite, immeasurable divine transformation**, the **True Root of divine illumination**, whose efficacy cannot be fathomed or recognized.

Without form or root, it towers beyond compare in the **Great Void**. At that time, the **Primordial Beginning Venerable Sovereign** renewed the **Great Chaos Cycle**, the **Mystic Light’s marvelous symbols** unfolded, the **Sacred Texts** flourished in luminous splendor, their **divine manifestations** marking the **Five Directions**, dividing **Upper Heaven and Lower Earth**, and enlightening all **lawful beings and categories**. This **Triple Mystery True Root Sacred Treasure**—may its **august teachings** be briefly revealed in the **Sacred Repository**, unfolding the **Supreme True Root’s** divine essence?

「披，一作披阅。 *The Imperial Scriptures of the Daoists*, in their original intent for cultivating and verifying the ranks of immortals, do not speak of harmonizing governance and achieving universal peace.

Yet here it says that the **Son of Heaven** attains governance through it, and the **national destiny** relies upon it for universal harmony—why so? It is because **Dao transformation** is complete, thus bringing governance and peace. When one awakens to the **True Root**, comprehending the **Great Dao**, then there is no need for speech to be believed, no need for action to effect change, nor for effort to achieve results. **Virtue** is vast, **transformation divine**, benefiting eternally without bound.

Thus it is said: *"Governance is the harmonization of governance and peace."*

**Mysterious virtue** is inherently without acquisition, unseen in giving or receiving, yet naturally its efficacy and transformation are boundless—hence, **mysterious virtue**.

As for the **Primordial Root**, all roots have form; yet **Dao** generates Heaven and Earth, though it encompasses the **Boundless**, the **Great Ultimate** gives rise to the diagram of the **Two Principles**, and the **Great Ultimate** itself is formless.

**The True** is that which cannot be seen, cannot be spoken of, and cannot be depicted in diagrams—these are merely **illustrative symbols** to guide the people. What **real form** does Heaven and Earth’s Root possess? Though no real form exists, its **eternal cyclic efficacy** is endless—hence the term **Primordial Root**.

**Awe-inspiring and numinous**, even the **saints of the Three Teachings** dare not slight it; its **marvelous transformation** is boundless—thus **Awe-inspiring and numinous**.

**The True Root of divine illumination** is the **doctrine of all sages**. It is also said: *"From here, ten thousand gods and sages emerge."*

**The Great Void**—its beginning is unseen, its end is unseen; it is hazy and cannot be grasped as a form—hence **The Great Void**.

*Revolutionizing the Cycle*—some say it means "revolutionizing the cycle at its end," but that is incorrect. This Scripture precedes the Great Cataclysm (*Hàojiè*), thus it revolutionizes the **Great Chaos Cycle**.

**Divine manifestations** in the **Five Directions**—originally, **Chaos Undivided** was formless; yet when **Directional positions** are distinguished and **internal and external** are separated, it is truly the **marvelous Dao transformation**—hence, **Divine manifestations in the Five Directions**.

**Chapter on Divine Spells**—sixth in number. Now, the **Imperial Dao** spreads forth and reaches all, its blessings extending to the **Ten Directions**.

Gazing upward upon the **cataclysmic cycles** and the **Dao’s winds**, the **True Wind** should be promoted.

The **subject’s heart** truly desires to make the **Sacred Repository’s** blessings cover the **Eight Extremities**, its **fragrant winds** scatter across the **Lantern Grove**—that the **barren branches** may aspire to the **luxuriant warmth** of **Summer’s Radiance**, and that the **corrupted remains** may receive the **nourishing essence** of the **True Scriptures**.

*The Scripture of Illuminating the True* contains **precepts**; now they should be implemented.

Gazing upward to the **Primordial Benevolence**, extending sincerest supplication below, the **subject humbly prays** for mercy and compassion, that the **Heavenly Sovereign** may condescend to pity the **people of the world**.

May this **Scripture of the *Lingbao Jade Slips*—the *True Texts*** be granted to the unworthy for brief revelation, and taught to those who have not yet heard?

The **Treasure of the Primordial Root**—may it be briefly unfolded in the **Sacred Repository**.

With the **Great Dao** now fully expounded and reaching all, **benevolent blessings** permeate the **Four Cardinal and Four Diagonal Directions**, from the **Upper Extremity to the Lower Extremity**, benefiting the **Ten Directions**.

Gazing upward upon the **cataclysmic cycles** and the **Dao’s winds**, the **True Wind** should be promoted.

The **subject’s heart** truly desires that the **Sacred Repository’s** blessings cover all **worlds within the Ten Directions**, extending to the **Eight Extremities**—that the **fragrant winds of Dao** may scatter across the **Lantern Grove** and the **Jade Enclosure**, their blessings nourishing all.

Those in the world who are **mired in stagnation**, **heterodox beings** who cling to **side paths**, **demons of Heaven** and **external heresies**, both **sentient and insentient**—all who have not heard the **True Dao**—shall receive salvation through the **True Scripture**.

Like the **barren branches** devoid of life’s intent, may they aspire to the **gentle warmth** that permeates **Summer’s Radiance**, reviving their withered state and flourishing anew. May the **corrupted remains**—those who, though alive, are as dead in ignorance of the **True Dao**—upon hearing the **True Scripture**, transcend and be reborn, their **marrow and bones renewed**.

The **nourishing essence of the Sacred Repository**—this is the **dew of enlightenment**.

**Illuminating the True**—the **Jade Emperor’s** clear decrees to all **True Ones**.

**Sincere supplication**—utterly devoting the **crimson heart**, humbly beseeching the **Supreme Sage**.

**People of the world**—those with **dark hair and yellow skin**, aged to **hoary white**, ever-changing yet without constancy—hence **people of the world**.

It is also said: *"The people born under the **Azure Sky**."* It is also said: *"**People of the world**—the multitude."*

**Sacred Repository**, **Jade Slips**, **True Texts**—all explained as before.

*Granted revelation and teaching*—praying that the **Heavenly Sovereign** may transmit this Scripture and instruct all **gods, humans, ghosts, and beings** in the **Dharma Realm**, thereby saving even those who have not yet heard of it.

Is it possible to be granted revelation and teaching to those who have not yet heard? This is but **modest doubt**, not daring to assert certainty, lest the **Supreme Sovereign’s** wondrous teachings be difficult to transmit. Hence, the subject first **humble beseeches**, and also employs **hesitant phrasing** to show the **urgency of the plea** and the **depth of reverence**.

**Chapter on Divine Spells**—sixth in number. At this time, the **Primordial Beginning Venerable Sovereign** reclined upon the **Celestial Table**, raised in **august dignity**, his **True Essence** distant yet luminous. Observing that the hour had come, he **universally convened** all **True Saints and Sages** to deliberate upon **Yin and Yang**, to calculate the **cycles of cataclysms**, to shift the **Celestial Pivot** at the **Yellow River’s source**, to **register the degrees of Heaven**, to **select worthy souls**, to **point and pluck** from the **Great Formlessness**, to **summon** the **Nine Mysteries**;

His **thoughts** opened the **ears of the ignorant**, yet the **obstructed voices** of those seeking the **True Path** were as if sealed by **barriers of sound**.

At that time, the **Five Elderly Sovereigns** raised questions without end. After much time, the **Primordial Beginning Venerable Sovereign** finally **lowered his gaze** in solemn contemplation, and with a **deep sigh**, declared: *"How profound and subtle! Your inquiry now—is it not excellent?"*

This is the **Primordial Root of the Sacred Repository**, the **True Texts of Natural Void**, giving birth to Heaven and Earth, **enlightening the divine**, and **bestowing blessings** upon the **Five Sacred Peaks**. It **settles the nation** and **brings prosperity to the people**.

The **Sacred Treasure of Mysterious Profundity** stands supreme among all things—Heaven’s revelations manifest in wondrous omens, and divine responses arise spontaneously.

The *Sacred Treasure True Texts* should be transmitted to those yet unenlightened.

At that time, the **Primordial Beginning Venerable Sovereign** stroked the **Jade Few** (a seat of transcendent transformation, not a mundane table) and ascended his **Treasure Seat**, his **Dao-body** towering in majestic stillness, lofty yet unyielding. In profound concentration, he silently unfolded boundless wisdom, his gaze piercing past, present, and future, discerning the appointed hour for **enlightenment and liberation**. Thus, he gathered all **Six Conditions** and **Ten Directions**, where all **Dharma-realms** converged in auspicious harmony. In this **Great Assembly of the True Saints**, the **Primordial Roots of Yin-Yang** were established, the **cycles of birth and transformation**—great and small, eons and cosmic turns—were calculated, the **Water Emperor of the Yellow River’s source** was realigned, the **celestial degrees** were verified and recorded, and **worthy souls of cultivated merit** were selected. With a gesture, he pointed to the **Ultimate Void**, and with a resonant chant, he intoned the **Nine Mysterious Chapters**.

Yet though the **Five Elderly Sovereigns**, the **Primordial Ancestors of Heaven and Earth**, pleaded with earnest supplication for the transmission of the **True Path**, their voices seemed sealed by barriers—**obstructed from the Dao**, their way to enlightenment blocked.

Then, the **Five Elderly Sovereigns** pressed their inquiries without cease. After much time, the **Primordial Beginning Venerable Sovereign** finally opened his **compassionate countenance**, his **sacred gaze** descending like a beacon. With a deep sigh, he declared: *"How profound and wondrous! How deep and boundless! Your questions now—are they not excellent?"*

This is the **Primordial Root of the Sacred Treasure**, the **True Texts of Void and Spontaneous Transformation**, giving rise to **Heaven’s Yang (Qian)** and establishing **Earth’s Yin (Kun)**, enlightening all **saints and divine beings** across every world. It **settles the Five Sacred Peaks**—**East Tai, South Huo (also called Heng), West Hua, North Heng, and Central Song**—bringing stability to successive ages and prosperity to all beings of the **Dharma-realm**.

The **Sacred Treasure’s** mysteries are most exalted among all things. Heaven manifests wondrous signs, Earth bears auspicious portents, and all spirits respond in natural accord.

**Chapter on Divine Incantations (Seven Sections)**

Now, the **Three Celestial Cycles** have completed their course, the **Six Heavenly Dao** has unfolded, and **miscellaneous teachings** have been revealed. There will be **thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao** to dispel the doubts of those who seek.

When this **Law’s** operation is fulfilled—after the **Three Dragons** (the three *yugas* of the *Lunhan* era) and in the year *Gēngzǐ*—**heterodox qi** will universally dissipate. The **Celestial Assemblies** will rejoice, and **Our True Dao** will then prevail.

For now, it may be entrusted to you. It shall be recorded in the **Upper Hall**, yet it cannot yet be practiced in the **Lower World**.

The **Mystic Precepts** are forbidden—do not transmit them recklessly.

You may personally go to the **Numinous Capital’s Purple Micro Palace**, listen to the **Celestial Voice** in the **Golden Decree**, and observe the **bowing and rising** before the **Divine Kings**. Only then will you be granted to receive the **Celestial Texts**, to govern the **Primordial Heaven’s** hosts.

*Zhěng* (整) is pronounced *lì* (立). This is a filler character, not correct.

If the **True Scripture** is transmitted, **Heaven’s Mystic Portents** will manifest, and **Numinous Responses** will arise naturally. What is the time now?

The **Three Qi** of the **Crimson Heaven** will realign the **Celestial Cycles**, and the **Six Sixes** of the **Heavens** will simultaneously unfold the **Dao**.

Through **miscellaneous minor teachings**, the **enlightenment and cultivation** will be revealed, with **thirty-six thousand kinds of doctrines** to clarify the hearts of those who seek the **Way**.

When this **Law’s** transformation is complete—after the **Three Dragons** (the three *yugas* of the *Lunhan* era) and in the year *Gēngzǐ*, during the **Zhēnyuán Assembly Cycle**—**heterodox qi** will universally dissipate, and the **Celestial Assemblies** will rejoice in the **Night of the Celestial Gathering**. Then, **Our True Dao’s** orthodox **Law** will prevail.

For now, it may provisionally be entrusted to you. It shall be recorded in the **Upper Mystic Heaven’s Hall**, yet it cannot yet be practiced in the **Lower Dusty World**.

The **Mystic Precepts of Heaven’s Law** are strictly forbidden—do not transmit them lightly.

You may personally go to the **Most Numinous Mystic Capital’s Purple Micro Palace**, listen to the **Celestial Voice**, and receive the **Golden Decree’s** solemn edicts. Observe the **bowing and rising** before the **Immortal Gods and Heavenly Kings, Marshals and Historians**, knowing the **Law’s** noble benefits.

Only then will you be granted to receive the **True Scripture’s Celestial Texts**, to govern the **Primordial Sovereign’s** harmonization of all **Heavens**.

The Three Heavens—those of **Qing** (Azure), **Chi** (Vermilion), and **Yu** (Jade) **Qi**—are the realms of the three **Qi** essences.
The Six Heavens encompass **desire**, **form**, **formless**, **light dust**, **fine dust**, **light defilement**, and **fine defilement**, among others.

The **Heavenly Emperors and Divine Humans** expound the **Great**, **Middle**, and **Lesser Vehicles** of **Dao** in their teachings, each according to their rank in **Dao** practice. They deliver varied **small methods** and guide beings through transformation.

There are **thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao**. Within the human body, there are **thirty-six thousand divine qi**, varying in clarity, illumination, and strength. Some hold **true faith**, while others harbor **heretical views**; their roots and capacities differ. When they study, they attain what aligns with their inherent nature—thus, there are **Great Vehicle** and **Lesser Vehicle** paths.

These are the **thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao**, meant to **dispel** the doubts of those who seek and to **respond** to the intentions of those who come to inquire after the **Way**. Some say it is to **respond to the intentions of those destined to come**, each receiving according to their affinity and belief.

Thus, those who attain **enlightenment** speak of their doubts **dissolving like ice melting**. The character **dispel** (*shì*) is correct. Those who use **choose** (*zé*) instead are mistaken.

The **Three Dragons** refer to the **beginning**, **middle**, and **end** of the **Dragon Han** era. Some say: **Dragon Han**, **Dragon Kang**, and **Dragon Zheng**. When **mixed qi** universally dissipates, the age grows auspicious, and **demonic influences** subside. The **Heavens rejoice in assembly**, gathering in times of universal prosperity. Some say: the **Heavens rejoice in the **Law Assembly***.

The **Mystic Precepts of Heaven’s Law** have **natural prohibitions**. Though the **Dao** does not discriminate in its transmission, speaking to the unworthy is **profaning Heaven’s treasures** and risks **erroneous speech**. Thus, the **Sages of the Three Teachings** must find the **right time**, the **right place**, and the **right person** before they **deliver the Law** and **transmit the Dao**.

The **Golden Decree** is compared to the **Mystic Decree**—it judges **merit and demerit** according to the **Law’s ordinances**. To **bow and rise before the Divine Kings** means to **look upward to the Immortals and downward to the Heavenly Kings and Marshal-Gods**, acknowledging the **Law’s** noble benefits.

To **govern the Primordial Sovereign’s Heavens** is to **command and lead** the Heavens transformed by the **Primordial Origin**. Some say: **bow and rise** (*fǔyǎng*) is akin to **demonstrate** (*shì*), meaning to **show reverence in bowing and humility in listening** before the Divine Kings, thus **governing the Primordial Sovereign’s Heavens**. To **assemble and lead the Heavens** is to **draw near to the **Law Vehicle** of the **Primordial Origin’s** highest Heaven. Both interpretations are valid.

**Chapter on Divine Incantations**

Then, the **Five Elder Celestial Sovereigns**, along with the **True Saints**, offered **pure incense**, upheld the **Precepts**, and wandered the **Cloud Paths**, summoning the **Ten Directions** with their **whistled commands**. They ascended to the **Upper Pure Supreme Mystic Jade Capital**, the **Cold-Spirit Elixir Hall**, and the **Purple Micro Upper Palace**, receiving the **Decree of Bowing and Rising**. Only then did they realize the **Heavenly Truth’s** nobility and rarity—how difficult it is to hear it immediately. Returning, they once more knelt before the **Primordial Dao**, inquiring about the **rituals of prohibition and precept**, humbly apologizing for their inadequacy.

They listened to the **Celestial Voice** through the **Golden Decree** before receiving the **True Scripture’s Heavenly Texts**.

Thus, the **Five Elder Celestial Sovereigns of the Five Directions**, along with the **Heavenly True Saints**, donned **pure incense**, observed the **Dao Precepts**, and circled the **Cloud Crossroads**, coming and going in guidance. They lingered along the **Cloud Paths**, chanting and commanding the **Ten Directions’ Holy Ones**, ascending to the **Upper Pure Supreme Mystic Jade Capital**, the **Heavenly Palace of Wondrous Realms**, the **Cold-Spirit Elixir Throne Hall**, and the **Purple Micro Upper Mystic Palace**, receiving the **Decree of Bowing and Rising**.

Only then did they grasp the **Heavenly Texts’ True Scripture’s** exalted and solemn nature—how rare and difficult it is to hear immediately. Returning, they once more knelt before the **Primordial Dao**, seeking clarification on the **rituals of prohibition and precept**, humbly acknowledging their insufficient wisdom.

**Pure Incense** refers to the **True Nature’s Heavenly Incense**, the **Pure and Natural Incense**, the **Non-Action’s Supreme Moral Dao Incense**—not the mundane burnt incense of the world.

**Upholding the Precepts** means observing the **Mystic Standards** with solemn reverence, as before the **Dao Ancestors**. They **guarded the Heavenly Sovereign’s Law Precepts**, wandering in boundless compassion, their **Mystic Light Vehicle** commanding the **Ten Directions** along the **Cloud Paths**.

The ancient scholars said: *"Heavenly Light and Cloud Shadows wander together"*—this is the meaning. It is not like the worldly **hesitation and back-and-forth movement**.

**Whistled Commands to the Ten Directions**—the **whistle** (*xiào*) is pronounced as **decree** (*chè*), not as **laugh** (*xiào*). Those who read it as **finesse** (*xiù*) are mistaken. The **whistle** is a solemn proclamation, not a jest or laughter.

**Ten Directions** refers not to the **Ten Sacred Treasures**, but to the **Ten Directional Divine Departments**.

To **ascend to the Immortals** is to **pay homage to the Primordial** and receive the **Law**, ascending in **Mystic Light** in silence, reverently listening to the **Mystic Teachings**—not the mundane climbing of steps.

The **Cold-Spirit Elixir Hall** lies above the **Nine Heavens**, where there is no sound or breath; the sun and moon cannot reach it. The **Heavenly Light** shines of its own accord, vast and boundless, pure and coldly solemn. The **Elixir Hall** radiates **Great Vermilion Jade Light**, hence the name.

The **Purple Micro Upper Palace** is the **Upper Mystic Palace** within the **Taiwei Heaven** above the **Purple Confluence**—not the **Purple Micro Enclosure** or **Taiwei Enclosure** as known in the mundane world.

**Bowing and Rising Decree**—see earlier explanation.

**Difficult to hear immediately** does not mean it is hard to hear at that very moment, but that it is difficult to **hear and immediately comprehend**. Some say: the **Heavenly Capital’s Scripture Keepers** do not allow immediate hearing. Returning, they once more ascend to the **Primordial Sovereign’s Nine Heavens**, paying homage to the **Supreme Primordial**, and are granted the **rituals of prohibition and precept**.

**Inquire**—see earlier explanation. To ask about the **Heavenly Law’s rituals** for transmitting and receiving the **Law**.

**Prohibition** refers to **decrees**; **Precept** refers to **statutes**.

**Humbly apologizing for inadequacy** does not mean they could not uphold prohibitions or observe precepts, but that they modestly acknowledged their **insufficient wisdom**—though their bodies were divine and their **Law Treasures** had never been truly penetrated, hearing them at once left their wisdom **unable to grasp** the depth. This is the true nobility of the **Five Old Ones’ Heavenly Dao**.

It is not self-imposed limitation, but the recognition that they were **unworthy to receive** this.

All things under Heaven have their **principles** and can **hear the Dao**. Thus, the **Four Spirits** gather their respective talents. Humans are the **most spiritual** of all things, and **Divine Beings** are the **highest rank** in the world—how could they not hear the **Dao**?

Thus, **Yan Hui** daily listened to **Confucius’ teachings** without deviation, as if in ignorance, yet understood through dialogue. After **Zhuo Lu’s** departure, he said, *"Though I wish to follow, there is no way."*

The **Bodhisattva Manjushrī** transmitted the **Sakyamuni Buddha’s True Law of the True Vehicle**—those who heard it were **deeply moved**.

「This aligns with the same meaning.

Those who hold this **Sutra** understand the **Five Old Ones’** humble yet profound intent in revering its sacred teachings—thus, they grasp the **Dao**.

The **Divine Beings’** *Spiritual Incantations* consist of **nine chapters**. At that time, the **Heavenly Sovereign** of boundless **virtue/power** and compassionate countenance, in pity, opened the **Spiritual Gate** and commanded the **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords**, to reveal the **Dongyang Sunlight Hall**. Unfolding the **Nine Radiant Lights and Eight Colors** of their **treasure**, the **Cloud-Brocade Bag**, they produced the ***Elemental Origin’s Spiritual Treasure: Scarlet Scripture, Jade Leaf, True Text***, inscribed in **golden script and jade seals**, profound and mysterious, capable of governing the **Heavenly Dao** and **Earthly principles** of all worlds. The ***Great Illuminating Perfection, Great Spiritual Treasure Incantation of the Jade Chapter***, was then proclaimed and entrusted to the **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords**.

Upon receiving this **Sutra**, the **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords** bowed in reverence, and the **Celestial Saints** of all realms knelt in homage, thanking the **Heavenly Sovereign, Jade Emperor**. They uplifted the **Dao’s** intent and followed the **Law** to transmit it.

The **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords** and the **True Saints** were unworthy to receive this, yet at that time, the **Elemental Origin’s Heavenly Sovereign** of boundless **virtue/power** and compassionate countenance, in pity and mercy, opened the **Spiritual Gate** with divine radiance. He commanded the **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords** to reveal the **Heavenly Sunlight Hall of Dongyang**, unfurling the **Nine Glorious Clouds and Eight Scenic Colors** of their **treasure**, the **Cloud-Brocade Bag**, and produced the ***Elemental Origin’s Spiritual Treasure: Scarlet Scripture, Jade Leaf, True Text***, inscribed in **golden script and jade seals**, profound and mysterious, secret and profound, capable of governing and harmonizing all worlds and **Heavenly Dao and Earthly principles**, the ***Great Illuminating Perfection, Supreme Great Spiritual Treasure Incantation of the Jade Chapter***, which was then proclaimed and entrusted to the **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords**.

At that time, the **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords** had received this **Sutra** in full. The **Celestial Saints** of all realms knelt in homage, thanking the **Heavenly Sovereign, Jade Emperor**. They uplifted the **Elemental Origin’s Dao** and followed this **Sutra’s** golden **Law**, to transmit it to all **Divine Beings and Humans** across the realms.

**Mercy and instruction**. **Mercy (愍)**, that is, the **Great Compassion (大悲)**.

「Instruction (谕), the act of opening and guiding. Some mistakenly claim it should be read as *and-yú* (和愉), but this is incorrect.

The **Divine Passages** were revealed. The **Heaven of Sutra Storage**, the **Crimson Spirit’s Mystic Portal**, stood wide and gaping.

One interpretation states: The **Divine Passages** were revealed to open the **Sacred Core**, to awaken the Heart and manifest the True.
Another interpretation states: The **Sacred Eyes** emitted radiance, and the **Divine Passages** were revealed.
Both interpretations are valid.

**Ascending to Proclaim**. The **Five Old Ones, Imperial Lords** were elevated in rank, brought near to receive the **Sovereign’s Personal Command**.

The **Dawning Yang’s Jade Hall**, the **Nine-Heaven Mystic Hall**, was boundless and unobstructed, eternally luminous and never dark. It was not constructed of tiles, stones, earth, or wood, but adorned with **Mystic Radiance** and wondrous scenes, its **Spiral Script** intricately arranged, a **Jade Chapter** of emerald hue—thus it was called.

The **Nine Lights** have been explained previously. The **Eight Colors** are: **Supreme Azure (太青)**, **Supreme Vermilion (太赤)**, **Supreme Yellow (太黄)**, **Supreme White (太白)**, **Supreme Dark (太玄)**, **Celestial Cyan (葱苍)**, **Jade Green (碧玉)**, and **Purple Gold (紫金)**.

**韫 (yùn)**, the repository of the **Sutra**, wherein the boundless **Mystic Radiance** is entirely contained.
**披 (pī)**, to unfold and reveal.
The **Cloud-Silk Bag**, the **Celestial Brocade of Clouds and Mist**, was a natural formation of **Dao** emanations, not the handiwork of the **Heavenly Youth** weaving. It was called a bag because the **Sutra’s** annotations were inscribed within it. The **Divine Beings** could not fathom its depths—thus it was called.
It was not like the coarse cloth, silk, leather, or furs of the mortal world.

The phrases *"Great Illuminating Perfection"* and *"Supreme Great Spiritual Treasure"* through *"Heavenly Dao and Earthly principles"* have all been explained previously.

**Great Radiance (大光明)**, for the **True Scripts** of the **Three Teachings** all extol the **Law of Perfection** as the **Spiritual Treasure**, and wherever it resides, there is light. The **Scriptures** of all other **Teachings** have limited radiance, but this *Royal Sutra*’s **Law** permeates the **Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds**, its luminosity undiminished across **aeons of kalpas**—thus it is called **Great Radiance**.

**Round and Fulfilled (圆满)**, the **Sacred Heart**’s boundless compassion and salvation. If one’s power is insufficient, the scope is limited, and there are deficiencies—thus it was said that one could not transform the **Northern Pole’s Lu State** nor the **Self-Sovereign Celestial Beings**, and it was difficult to call such **Round and Fulfilled**.

This *Royal Sutra* encompasses all **dharma**, penetrating all **vehicles**, its efficacy infinite and inexhaustible. Though it is said that the **Dao** does not force or compel, its transformations occur naturally, and all categories of beings—from beginning to end—cycle through its influence without any who are not transformed by it. Thus it is called **Round and Fulfilled**.

The **Divine Incantation of the Jade Chapter**, the **Essential Teachings of the True Ones**, the **Mystic Secrets of the Gods**, the **Key Essence for Delivering the World**—all other **Teachings’** divine powers do not surpass this; its reverence is unmatched. Thus it is called.

Another examination: Human nature’s enlightenment of the **Dao** is vast and enduring, difficult to forget even through **great kalpas**. Like a bag that does not leak, the moment of awakening is akin to the mouth of the bag—thus the **Sutra’s** annotations speak of the bag.

**Heavenly Sovereign (天尊)**, some read it connected to the preceding sentence: *"They knelt in homage and thanked the **Heavenly Sovereign, Original Beginning**"*; others read it connected to the following: *"The **Jade Emperor** is the **Sovereign** of all **Heavens**."* The latter interpretation may be adopted. The rest has been explained previously.

The **Divine Incantations Chapter** consists of ten sections. At that time, the **Heavenly Sovereign of the Azure Spirit (青灵始老苍帝)**, who received the **Divine Incantations Edict**, was stationed in the **Eastern Treasure Forest of Peaceful Preservation (安宝华林)**. The **Eastern Nine Qi (九炁)**—the Azure Sovereign of the Original Heaven (始皇青天), the Verdant Celestial Pile (碧霞郁垒)**—within which dwells the **Venerable Old Man (老人)**, oversees the **Register of Destiny (图录)**, commands the **Qi** and ascends to **Xian (仙)**.

To the right, the **Secret Scriptures of the Azure Sovereign for Delivering Humans to Xian (度人录仙青帝秘文)****,** twenty-four characters, inscribed upon the **Mysterious Terrace of the Nine Heavens (九天玄台)**, governs the summoning of the **Nine-Heaven Sovereign (九天上帝)** and the rectification of the **Register of Immortals (神仙图录)**. The **Year-Star (岁星)** assists the liver, while the **Horn (角)** and **Knee (亢)** stars stabilize the **True (真)**. The **Room (房)** and **Tail (尾)** stars oversee the **Four Scenes (四景)**, revolving in harmony. The **Sieves (箕)** commands the seven stars of the **Big Dipper (七辰)**, while the **Upright Fighter (正斗)** illuminates the **Wheel of Destiny (明轮)**. By capturing **Qi** and seizing the **False (非)**, it sweeps away the **Group of Calamities (灾群)**.

To the right, the **Secret Scriptures of the Stars (制星秘文)**, thirty-two characters, inscribed in the **Eastern Hall of the Purple Micro (紫微宫东华殿)**, governs the summoning of the **Celestial Officials (星官)** and the rectification of the **Heavenly Divisions and Degrees (天分度)**.

The **Eastern Mountain Divine Incantations (东山神咒)**, inscribed in **Red Scriptures and Edicts (赤书符命)**, subdue the **Mountain of Assemblies (酆山)**, bind the **Demons (魔)**, and dispatch the **Ghosts (鬼)**—none escape its judgment. All must proceed to the **Wood Palace (木宫)**, daring not to delay.

To the right, the **Secret Scriptures Against Demons (制魔秘文)**, thirty-two characters, inscribed in the **Eastern Hall of the Mysterious Spirit (东华玄灵之馆)**, governs the subjugation of **Ghosts and Demons (鬼魔)** and the rectification of the **Nine-Heaven Qi (九天炁)**. Below, it commands the **Eastern River (东河)** and the **Spirits of the Boundless Seas (溟海水神)**. In times of **Great Kalpas (大劫)** and **Flooding Disasters (洪灾)**, the **Kylin Dragons (蛟龙)** bear the weight of their bodies. When the **Water Palaces (水府)** are opened, the paths extend ten thousandfold. The **Heavenly Sovereign’s Red Scriptures (上帝赤文)** command the winds and fires without obstruction.

To the right, the **Secret Scriptures of Water (制水秘文)**, thirty-two characters, inscribed upon the **Nine-Heaven Eastern-Northern Jade Gate and Vermilion Terrace (九天东北玉阙丹台)**, governs the subjugation of the **Eastern Sea Water Sovereign (东海水帝)**, the **Great Kalpa Flooding Disasters (大劫洪灾)**, and the summoning of **Kylin Dragons (蛟龙)** and **Water Spirits (水神)** for their duties.

The **True Scripture of the Eastern Nine Qi Spirit Treasures (《东方九炁灵宝玉篇》)****—**all one hundred twenty characters—**are the perfect scriptures of the **Supreme Lord of the Most High Great Radiant Dao (太上无上大光明)**,** the **Complete and Natural Divine Incantations (圆满神咒空洞自然之书)**. It is also known as the **Scripture of the Birth of the Divine and Preservation of the True (《生神保真洞玄章》)****,** the **Eastern Mountain Divine Incantations (《东山神咒》)****,** and the **Azure Sovereign’s Eight Thunders Edict (《青帝八威策文》)**.

These **Edicts of the Jade Emperor (玉皇诰命)**** are granted to the **Nine-Qi Heavenly Lords of the Eastern Treasure Forest of Peaceful Preservation, Azure Spirit Heavenly Sovereign (东方安宝华林青灵始老苍帝九炁天君)**,** commanding them to oversee all **Eastern Heavens and Earths (东方诸天诸地)**, the **Sun, Moon, and Starry Hosts (日月星宿)**, the **Sacred Mountains and Spirit Caverns (名山灵洞)**, the **Water Palaces and Spring Palaces (水府泉宫)**, the **Supreme High Lords (上圣高尊)**, and the **Holy Immortal Assemblies (真仙圣众)**—**all manifestations of power and spirit (一切威灵)**. Wherever the **Scriptures and Edicts (符命)** descend, they must be obeyed as decreed.

The **Jade Emperor** reverently upholds the **Dao**’s decrees, following the **Law** to transmit the **True Scripture**’s divine incantations—what is their intent?

The **Five Old Heavenly Lords**, with the **Eastern** as their foremost. The **Eastern** embodies **Wood Virtue**. The **Sacred Edicts** received by the **Azure Spirit Heavenly Sovereign of the Eastern Treasure Forest of Peaceful Preservation (安宝华林青灵始老苍帝)**.

The **Six Sentences of the Eastern Nine-Qi Heavenly Lords for Summoning Qi and Elevating Immortals**, comprising **24 characters**, are the **transcripts of the World-Transcending and Human-Liberating Records of Daoist Immortals and the Azure Emperor’s** hidden sacred texts, inscribed upon the **Primordial Platform of the Nine Heavens**, to **convoke the Nine-Heaven Heavenly Lords** and **rectify the Daoist Immortals’ diagrams and talismans**—all **secret utterances of the Immortals and Celestial Masters**, which **dare not be fully expounded**.

The **Eight Sentences from the Year-Star to Assist the Liver and Sweep Away Disastrous Groups**, comprising **32 characters**, are the **Star’s Secret Texts**, inscribed in the **Eastern Hua Hall of the Purple Micro Palace (紫微宫东华殿)**, to **convoke the Wood Virtue Star Lord** and **regulate the celestial divisions**.

The **Eight Sentences from the Eastern Divine Incantations to the Dare Not Delay**, comprising **32 characters**, are the **Secret Texts of the Eastern Demons**, inscribed in the **Eastern Hua Azure Spirit Hall (东华玄灵之馆)**, to **subdue the ghosts and demons** and **rectify the Nine-Qi of the Eastern realms**.

The **Eight Sentences from the Eastern River Regulation to the Uninterrupted Wind and Fire**, comprising **32 characters**, are the **Secret Texts of the Eastern Waters**, inscribed upon the **Nine-Heaven Eastern-North Jade Gate Vermilion Platform (九天东北玉阙丹台)**, to **subdue the Eastern Sea Water Emperor**, **great calamities and floods**, and **convoke the dragons and water deities**.

The **Eastern Nine-Qi Sacred Incantations (九炁灵宝赤书玉篇)**—the **True Scripture**—comprises **120 characters**, all being the **Supreme Most Perfect Great Light and Fulfilled Divine Incantations**, the **Natural and Spontaneous Scriptures of the Void**, also known as the **Scripture of Preserving the Divine Essence and Safeguarding the True (生神宝真洞玄章)** and the **Azure Emperor’s Eight Thunders Edict (青帝八威策文)**.

The above cannot be deciphered.
Thus, the original text is re-inscribed.

The **Jade Emperor’s Edicts** are bestowed upon the **Nine-Qi Heavenly Lords of the Eastern Treasure Forest of Peaceful Preservation, Azure Spirit Heavenly Sovereign (安宝华林青灵始老苍帝九炁天君)**.

They command these Lords to **oversee the Eastern Heavens and Earths, the Sun, Moon, and Starry Hosts, the Sacred Mountains and Spirit Caverns, the Water Palaces and Spring Palaces, and the Holy Immortals and Celestial Assemblies**—all **manifestations of power and spirit**. Wherever the **Scriptures and Edicts** descend, they must be obeyed as decreed.

In harmony with this, the **Eastern Heavens, Earths, and Waters** are all governed. All **deities and spirits** reverently follow this command, without fail.

This **Scripture preserves the profound secrets of the great virtue of Heaven, Earth, and all beings, causing demons to lose their resolve, transcending calamities, and sparing disasters**. The **Celestial Assemblies dare not disobey**, thus it **permanently secures the Eastern realms**.

**Eleventh Chapter: Divine Incantations**

**Dao-Speech says**:

**Primordial Origin’s wondrous speech**,
**Jade Sovereign’s true edicts**,
**Supreme Purity’s natural sacred scriptures**,
**Nine Heavens’ primordial mystic scriptures**,
**void’s sacred chapters**,
**Highest Saint’s secret words**,
**Jade Sovereign’s exalted ordinances**—
**completing the heavens and establishing the earth**,

**preserving and stabilizing the Five Sacred Peaks**,
**all beings endure**.

**The Five Directions’ Divine Cauldrons’ wondrous transformations are boundless—why so?**
**Dao-Speech says**:

**This is the Great Divine Cauldron**—
**Primordial Origin’s Supreme Heavenly Lord’s most mystic speech**,
**Jade Sovereign’s Supreme Heavenly Lord’s most true treasure-edicts**,
**Supreme Purity’s Mystic Primordial Natural Sacred Scriptures**,
**Nine Heavens’ Immortal Realm’s primordial mystic scriptures and immortal talismans**,

**summoning all gods and dispatching true immortals**—
**this is the Great Divine Cauldron**,
**the utmost true mystic scriptures**,
**divine transformations responding wondrously**,
**emerging only from the natural**.

「The highest station is in the heavens,
obtaining the *One* to attain clarity,
lofty and bright, vast and enduring—
this is what brings forth the heavens’ lofty purity.

The lowest station is in the earth,
obtaining the *One* to attain tranquility,
broad and profound, vast and enduring—
this is what brings forth the earth’s enduring stability.

Forever securing and preserving the Five Sacred Peaks and named mountains,
all myriad beings and categories made to endure eternally.

**Dao/Way**’s utterances—
these are the Five *Lao* Celestial Deities’ **virtue/power**-bestowed teachings and praises,
thus they are called *Yuan Shi* Jade Sovereign and such,
not the *Yuan Shi* self-praising.

The wondrous utterances and sacred scriptures of the utmost **virtue/power**—
all explained as seen before.

The *Nine Heavens’* primordial **Dao/Way**’s secret inscriptions**,
called *handwritten scrolls* (*zhà*)—
The *Jade Sovereign’s True Scripture* (*Yùhuáng Zhēnjīng*)
is without form or sound,
yet radiant light and wondrous tones permeate the Ten Directions and all **dharma realms**,
enduring through kalpas without destruction—
not written by human hands,
but all from the natural.

Not transmitted by speech,
but all from the **mind-seal**’s mysteries.

Tracing it, there is no beginning,
existing before the Great Void’s formless expanse—
thus it is called the *Nine Heavens’* primordial **Dao/Way**’s secret inscriptions**.

The *Jade Sovereign’s* exalted **scriptures** (*Zhēndiǎn*),
for the **son of heaven**’s abode is called *Zhēn*,
and *Yuan Shi* is the sovereign of all teachings,
dwelling in the *Jade Purity Sacred Realm*,
with **Dao/Way**’s transformations beyond reckoning—
thus it is called *Yùhuáng*.

This **True Scripture** surpasses all teachings’ texts,
no deity or sage dares defy it—
the **heavenly laws** are as heavy as golden decrees,
and the Ten Directions’ holy guardians are as stern as precious defenses—
thus it is called the *exalted scriptures*.

**To stabilize spirits**—
to keep all gods from displaying their **godly powers** (*shéntōng*),
calmly abiding without action.

**To govern spirits**—
to keep all spirits from revealing their **mystic resonance** (*língxiǎng*),
restraining their awe and **virtue/power**.

**To guide and govern cosmic transformations and kalpas**—
throughout beginning and end of the **dharma realms**,
overseeing the kalpas’ revolutions,
transformations and guidance without limit—
to make them cycle endlessly,
unshaken and undisturbed—
thus it is called *guiding and governing cosmic transformations and kalpas*.

**To command the Earth Spirits** (*dìzhǐ*)—
this is the **scripture’s** profound decree, not the whip of command.
**To direct and harness yin and yang**—
as yin and yang ebb and flow,
**Dao/Way** truly governs them—
thus it is said *to direct and harness yin and yang*,
not to mean *enslaving yin spirits and yang deities*.

**To summon gods**—
to gather all gods.

**To dispatch true immortals** (*xiān*):
true immortals are the **son of heaven**’s honored guests—
why say *to dispatch*?
For *Yuan Shi* proclaims this **Scripture**,
the authentic core of the Three Teachings,
all gods reverently accept it—
thus it is said *to dispatch true immortals*.

Heaven and earth have limits,
all beings may eventually perish—
yet why say *all myriad categories endure*?
From kalpa to kalpa, life perpetually renews,
all relying on the Great **Dao/Way**—
thus it is said *all myriad categories endure*.

The *Great Divine Cauldron*’s **Scripture** comprises sixteen chapters,
which the Jade Sovereign once bestowed upon the Five *Lao* Celestial Deities.

At that time, the Five Emperors knelt in long reverence,
holding this sacred scroll,
secretly inscribed with praises in the **mystic capital** (*Língdū*).

The *Heavenly True Immortal* (*Tiānzhēn*) once recorded these words,
entrusted to the *Upper Purity Sacred Realm*’s *Great Mystic Jade Capital*,
the *Cold Soul Elixir Hall* (*Hánlíng Dāndiàn*),
and the *Purple Cloud Celestial Palace* (*Zǐwēi Shànggōng*).

Through countless kalpas and cosmic revolutions,
its words preserved the **heavenly roots** (*Tiāngēn*),
unbroken and uncorrupted—
aligned with the **primordial revolutions** (*Yuán yùn*), shifting as they turn.

This *Great Divine Cauldron*’s **Scripture**—
when mixed with chaos, it remains undefiled,
when defiled, it shines ever purer;
when destroyed, it is not extinguished,
when extinguished, it becomes supremely luminous.

The **Great Ultimate**’s profound mysteries—
the Heavenly True Immortals hold them in reverence,
its own radiant light and **true name** (*Zhēnmíng*) manifest,
as the Jade Sovereign’s decrees are inscribed upon golden tablets,
revealing to all future generations of beings.

This **Scripture**’s words are hidden and profound,
unseen by ordinary folk.

Those who attain this **Dao/Way**’s children
preserve all **cosmic qi** (*wànjī*) in eternal existence.
Diligently practicing and revering it,
they attain **godly immortality** (*shénxiān*),
and bow in homage to the Exalted Sovereign.

The Five Emperors knelt in long reverence,
holding this precious scroll—
the **Scripture** dwells in heaven,
its words are **Dao/Way**’s mysteries, not worldly texts—
how then speak of *handwritten*?
The heavenly gods reverently embrace it,
expressing utmost respect.

**Secretly inscribed**—
this means to praise and record it.
The Heavenly True Immortals’ scriptures
are all **Dao/Way**’s radiant celestial texts,
golden and jade characters,
each a wondrous span of a yard in length.
The *Upper Purity Sacred Realm* is the abode of the **Lingbao** treasures**,
and the **Scripture** originates from the *Primordial Beginning*’s Exalted Sovereign,
transmitted by **Lingbao**—
thus it is called the *Upper Purity Sacred Realm*.
Its words preserve the **heavenly roots**,
the **Scripture**’s essence unbroken through kalpas—
thus the **heavenly roots**’ eternal preservation is known.

Some may say it preserves the **heaven’s root**,
making it endure—
this cannot be followed.
For after the *Primordial Beginning* (*Yuán Huì*),
heaven cannot last forever—
thus it is known this is not the **heaven’s root**.

**Aligned with the revolutions**—
enduring through kalpas.

When mixed with chaos, it remains undefiled—
when laws and doctrines are confused,
the true **Dao/Way** persists,
yet this **Scripture** cannot be defiled.
When defiled, it shines ever purer—
those who profane this **Scripture** face heavenly punishment,
its **virtue/power** and purity ever more evident.

When destroyed, it is not extinguished—
the foolish and perverse who slander and destroy this **Scripture**
cannot erase it.
When extinguished, it becomes supremely luminous—
in an age without **Dao/Way**,
if they seek to destroy this **Scripture**,
its teachings will spread widely,
its brilliance ever more manifest.

The **Great Ultimate**’s profound mysteries—
ever-present through kalpas,
found everywhere without absence—
not ordinary forms,
but **wondrous existence** (*miàohǔ*).
Thus it is called *the **Great Ultimate***.

Some may say *the **Great Ultimate**’s profound mysteries* are the words of the *Court of Ultimate Mysteries*—
this is too restrictive.»

Illuminating future births—
the myriad lives to come are not merely one person’s future existence.
Those unable to glimpse or hear it—
only the **Most Venerable Ones** (*zhìshèng*) know this **Scripture**,
while common folk merely recite its words.

Evil spirits dare not peek,
while the lowly and ignorant cannot hear it.
Those who grasp the **Dao/Way**’s principles within this **Scripture**,
preserve my **ten thousand kinds of qi** (*wànqì*) eternally,
and through diligent practice reach **Divine Immortal** (*shénxiān*) status,
thus paying homage to the **Most High Emperor** (*Dàdì*).

Some say *pay homage to the Five Elders of the Emperor*—
this is too restrictive.

One alternative:
*preserve the **ten thousand transformations**’s *qi* eternally,
also suffices.

This passage reveals the **Scripture**’s manifest efficacy.

**Chapter 3: The Virtue/Power of the Jade Sovereign** (*Yùhuáng Gōngdé Pǐn*)
**Continuation of Chapter 1, following the previous ten chapters**
At that time, the Jade Void Emperor (*Yùxū Dìshì*) addressed the Celestial Venerable (*Tiānzūn*):

*"May the Most Venerable One’s compassion universally benefit the Four Assemblies, the **Emperors and Releases** (*Dìshè*), the Four **Brahmā Kings** (*Fàn Tiānwáng*), all the **Heavens** (*Zhūtian*), all the **Immortal Ones** (*Zhūxiān*), and all future beings who uphold this **Scripture** and proclaim its benefits."*

At that time, the Celestial Venerable replied to the Jade Void Emperor:

*"How joyous is this inquiry—
is it not most excellent? (*bù yì shànhū*)
You, moved by compassion,
pity the suffering of all beings,
thus asking me for elucidation.
Return to your seat,
and I shall expound it for you.*

When the Jade Sovereign (*Yùdì*) entrusted this **Scripture** to the Five Elders of the Emperor,
the Jade Void Emperor ascended and reported to the **Great Celestial Venerable** (*Dà Tiānzūn*), the **Scripture**’s master:

*"May the Most Venerable One’s compassion universally benefit the world’s Four Assemblies,
all the **Heavenly Emperors and Releases** (*Tiānshì Dìshè*),
the Four **Brahmā Kings** of the Three Realms (*Sānjiè shàng sì Fàn Tiānwáng*),
all the **Heavens** (*Zhūtian*),
all the **Immortal Ones** of every rank (*Zhūxiān*),
and all future beings who uphold this **True Scripture** and proclaim its benefits."*

At that time, the **Great Celestial Venerable**, the **Scripture**’s master, replied to the Jade Void Emperor:

*"How gladdening is this question—
is it not most excellent? (*bù yì shànhū*)
You, with compassionate heart,
pity the world’s suffering beings,
thus asking me for elucidation.
Return to your seat,
and I shall expound the **Scripture**’s meaning for you."*

When the **Celestial Venerable** (*Tiānzūn*) refers to *Yuan Shi*,
or to the Jade Sovereign (*Yùdì*),
this is incorrect.
The Four Assemblies (*Sìzhòng*) are explained earlier.
**Emperors and Releases** (*Dìshè*) are the Heavenly Emperors,
and the **Buddhas, Bodhisattvas** (*Fó, Púsà*), and others of the **Release Teachings** (*Shìjiào*).
Some may say all Heavenly sovereigns are called **Emperors and Releases**,
which is also acceptable.
If one mistakenly takes *Emperor* (*Dì*) as the sovereign of the **Emperors and Releases Heaven** (*Dìshè Tiān*),
this is the erroneous interpretation of the **Monks** (*Sēngjiā*).
They wrongly apply the Heavenly sovereigns of all **Scriptures** to the Jade Sovereign,
unaware that the Jade Sovereign is the **宗** (*zōng*) of the ten thousand **Heavens**,
not merely the sovereign of one **Heaven**.

The **Release Teachings** (*Shìjiào*) state:
*"The **Brahmā King Emperor** (*Fànwáng Dìshè*) is the **呈祥** (*chéngxiáng*)."*
This means the **宗** (*zōng*) of the Heavenly **Buddhas**,
not daring to speak of the Jade Sovereign.
Monks arbitrarily misinterpret,
which is also a grave offense.
Hence, I include them both.

The Four **Brahmā Kings** (*Sì Fàn Tiānwáng*) are the great **Brahmā Kings** of the Three Realms’ uppermost tier,
not the sovereigns of the **Desire Realm**’s lower **Heavens**.
When speaking of **Brahmā Heavens** (*Fàn Tiān*),
it encompasses all upper **Realms**.
The **Heavens of the Heavenly Hosts** (*Zhǒngmín Zhūtian*) are not mentioned,
for their ranks above are all **至真大仙** (*Zhìzhēn Dàxiān*—**Supreme True Immortals**),
who naturally align with this **Scripture**,
thus no need to specify them.

All the **Heavens** (*Zhūtian*), all the **Immortal Ones** (*Zhūxiān*—**of every rank**),
from beneath the **Brahmā Heavens** down,
all Heavenly sovereigns, deities, and **民** (*mín*—**subjects of the Heavens**),
and all **Immortal Ones** of every rank (*Zhūxiān*).

**Proclaiming its benefits**—
the **Great Dao/Way** does not speak of effects,
so why does the Jade Void Emperor request benefits to be spoken of?
The **Great Dao/Way** is the **宗** (*zōng*) of all **Heavens**, earth, and beings.
It inherently possesses real benefits,
bringing natural advantage to all beings.
The **Heavens**, earth, and the Four Assemblies,
who do not know this **Scripture**,
do not understand its meaning,
dare not believe or follow it,
thus they slight the **Great Law** (*Dàfǎ*)
and mislead themselves.
The **Great Dao/Way**’s compassion is boundless,
unable to bear the world’s delusion,
thus it speaks of benefits to guide beings.
How can the foolish and deluded still say,
*"This **Scripture** merely contains trivial and obscure theories—
what benefit does it bring?"*

Do they not know that this **Scripture** gives birth to all **Heavens**, earth, and beings,
and cannot be separated for even a moment?
All beings, everywhere, should recite and uphold it,
throughout kalpas without end,
bringing great natural benefits,
not merely alluring people with effects.
Is it not most excellent?
This is not a word of doubt,
but a commendation of the excellent inquiry.

*"You"* (*rǔ*)—
Yuan Shi addresses the Jade Void Emperor.
*"I"* (*wú*)—
Yuan Shi refers to himself.
*"Return to your seat"* (*fù zuò*)—
a command for the Jade Void Emperor to resume his listening position.

*"I shall expound"* (*xiānshuò*)—
*broadly proclaim* (*guǎngbù wéi xiān*) and *explain* (*gàoyǔ wéi shuò*).

**Fàn** (*Brahmā*)—
pronounced as *fú* (with the tone of 扶 *fú*).

Some mistakenly write it as **梵** (*Fàn*), but this is incorrect.

This is the sincere request to expound the **Scripture**,
and the heart of universal benefit.

**Continuation of Chapter 18, following the previous ten chapters**
The Celestial Venerable spoke:

*"If within the Three Realms or the ten directions of boundless lands,
wars arise and armies clash,
or pestilential **qi** (*yìqì*) spreads,
or floods, droughts, insects, and locusts plague the land,
or calamities bring famine,
then the kings and ministers of those lands
should issue compassionate decrees,
commanding all officials in their states, counties, towns, and prefectures,
to order the **Dao/Way**’s adherents (*Dàomén zhūliú*)
to maintain purity and solemnity,
and within their **observatories** (*guàn*)
establish grand **fasting rituals** (*Zhāijiào*),
practicing the **Dao/Way** at all six times of day,
to circulate this **Scripture**,
then the land will achieve peace,
the five grains will flourish abundantly,
and the people will live in security and harmony."*

After the Yuan Shi Celestial Venerable commanded the Jade Void Emperor to return to his seat and listen to the **Scripture**,
he spoke thus:

*"If within the Three Realms—**Heavens**, earth, and humans—
or the ten directions of the four **Quadrants** (*Sìzhèng*), four **Pairs** (*Sì’ǒu*), and their upper and lower tiers,
or the limitless lands of all **Realms**,
wars arise and armies clash,
or Heavenly calamities spread, encountering pestilential **qi** (*yìqì*) rampant,
or years bring scarcity, with floods, droughts, insects, and locusts,
or disasters cause famine,
then the kings and ministers of those lands
should issue compassionate decrees,
for their **黎民** (*Límín*—**common folk**), officials, and subjects,
commanding all within the states, counties, towns, and prefectures,
to order the **Dao/Way**’s adherents (*Dàomén zhūliú*)
to maintain **清冷** (*qīnglěng*—**cool purity**) and solemnity (*yánjié*),
and within their **observatories** (*guàn*)
establish grand **齐醮** (*Qíjiào*—**fasting rituals for purification and expiation**),
practicing the **Dao/Way** at all six times of day (*báijiū xiángdào*),
to circulate this **True Scripture**,
then the land will achieve peace (*qīngpíng*),
the five grains will flourish abundantly (*wǔgǔ fēngshú*),
and the people will live in security and harmony (*Límín āntài*)."*

Some may say the Three Realms cannot be called **Heavens**,
for fear of conflicting with the phrase *lands, armies, and calamities*.
But the **Heavenly Demons** (*Tiānmó*) and Heavenly sovereigns
contend for dominion in the streets,
engaging in battles,
each with their own demarcated **Realms** (*jiè*),
thus it is known that the Three Realms refer to **Heavens**, earth, and humans.

「When wars and conflicts (*bīnggē*) erupt, it refers not to two distinct kinds of weapons rising simultaneously, but rather to hostilities breaking out in various places—each side engaging in mutual warfare. Swords, spears, and all such implements are simply weapons (*bīngqì*), no different from *戈* (*gē*—**halberds**) or *戟* (*jǐ*—**crossbow spears**). Thus, it is incorrect to say that "wars and conflicts" (*bīnggē*) arise together.

Some may argue that "wars and conflicts" (*bīnggē*) mean "soldiers and weapons" (*bīng zuò rén*—**soldiers and men**), with "men" and "weapons" (*rén gē*) arising together, but this is also not accurate.

When pestilential **qi** (*yìqì*—**epidemic qi**) spreads rampantly, the **Dao/Way** of Heaven (*Tiāndào*—**Heavenly Dao/Way**) maintains its regular order, yet calamities are termed as "variations" (*bìan*—**aberrations**). The rampant spread of pestilential **qi** (*yìqì*) is indeed a calamity (*zāiyì*—**disaster and aberration**). The same holds true for epidemics (*shíli*—**seasonal pestilence**), which are also calamities (*zāiyì*).

This **Scripture** (*jīng*—**Sutra**) serves to rescue and alleviate such afflictions.

Floods and droughts (*shuǐhàn*—**water and fire calamities**), insects ravaging crops (*chóng*—**pests**), and swarms of locusts destroying harvests (*qúnxiāng shāngjià*—**locusts harm the grain**) are all calamities (*zāiyì*).

When harvests fail (*suì bù shú*—**years of poor harvest**), causing suffering among people and creatures (*mínwù bù ān*—**the populace and living beings are unsettled**), it is termed as *凶* (*xiōng*—**harsh calamity**). When things deviate from the norm (*yìcháng*—**aberrant**), it is called *灾* (*zāi*—**disaster**); when grains are not ripe (*gǔ bù shú*—**grains do not mature**), it is *饥* (*jī*—**famine**); when vegetables are not ripe (*cài bù shú*—**vegetables do not mature**), it is *馑* (*jǐn*—**scarcity**).

All these are calamities (*zāiyì*).

*黎* (*Lí*—**common folk**), *黔黎* (*Qiánlí*—**the dark-skinned commoners**); *庶* (*shù*—**commoners**), *庶民* (*shùmín*—**the populace**).
*遍勑* (*biànli*—**to exhaustively exhort**).
*遍* (*biàn*) and *徧* (*biàn*) are the same.

*州县镇宰* (*zhōuxiàn zhènzǎi*—**regional governors and magistrates**), which may mean:
- the officials who govern states and counties, overseeing the common folk (*zhōuxiàn tǒngzhèn bǎixìng zhī guān*—**governors and magistrates who control the populace**), or
- the officials of military garrisons (*zhèn*—**military prefectures**), or
- the high-ranking officials such as the viceroys and governors-general (*duūfū*—**supervisors and envoys**).

All interpretations are valid.

These are the kings and ministers of their respective lands, just as the kings and ministers of these places [mentioned earlier].」

「The Daoists, including those of the **Quánzhēn** (Complete Reality), **Zhèngyī** (Orthodox Unity), **Qīngwēi** (Pure Mystery), and **Língbǎo** (Numinous Treasure) sects, are marked by **purity and solemnity**, both inwardly and outwardly, with their bodies and minds in perfect harmony. Their attire and ritual spaces are meticulously ordered, and they conduct themselves with **reverence, solemnity, and unwavering consistency**—thus embodying **purity and solemnity**.

*Guān* (观), meaning **contemplation**, is where the **divine presence** resides. Those who gaze upon it rise in **awe and respect**—this is indeed the **Great Vision**. Hence, it is called *guān*.

They establish **grand liturgical rites** (*dàzhài jiào*—**great exorcistic offerings**), harmonizing the inner and outer, uniting the collective will, and rectifying discord through **fasting** (*zhāi*). They **invoke and thank the divine beings** (*qíxiè shénzhī*—**pray to and give thanks to the divine**), repay the heavens and earth, **concentrate virtue upon the divine** (*hé dé yú shén*—**merge virtue with the divine**), and, following the prescribed methods, **attract blessings** (*yīkē qìfú*—**invoke blessings according to the ritual**) through *jiào* (醮).

They practice the Dao **six times daily** (*liùshí xíngdào*—**sixfold Daoic observance**), not as the common practice of wandering along roads, but simply by **following the ritual to invoke the divine** (*yīkē qìshén*—**invoke the divine according to the ritual**) and **reciting scriptures and Daoic teachings** (*zhuǎnjīng niàndào*—**turning the scriptures and reciting the Dao**).

Some say the **twelve times of day and night** (*shíèr shí*), with **odd hours** (*qíshí*) for activity and **even hours** (*ǒushí*) for stillness. The **six times** (*liùshí*) should be understood as **子, 寅, 辰, 午, 申, 戍**—the **midnight, 3-5 AM, 7-9 AM, noon, 3-5 PM, and 7-9 PM hours**. Alternatively, some interpret it as the **six daytime hours** (*báizhòu liùshí*—**six hours of daylight**). Both interpretations are acceptable.

**Turning the scriptures** (*zhuǎnjīng*) means aligning one’s mind with the Dao, holding the **authentic scriptures** (*zhēnjīng*—**true scriptures**), ensuring that **lands and beings are free from calamity** (*guótǔ wú èjiān*—**countries and beings without hardship**), and attaining **serene peace** (*dé qīngpíng*).

Rice, millet, sorghum, beans, and wheat—**the five grains** (*wǔgǔ*)—all flourish in abundance. The **common folk** (*língmín*—**people of the populace**) across all lands and realms suffer no disasters, forever dwelling in **tranquil security** (*ānrán dìng*—**secure stillness**) and **unshaken joy** (*tàirán lè*—**unfaltering happiness**).

The **merits and virtues** (*gōngdé pǐn*) continue from the previous nineteen chapters. If one encounters **venomous and ferocious beasts** (*dú è wūshòu*—**poisonous, evil, and fierce beasts**) in the mountains and forests, simply **retain a single thought** (*cúnxiǎng yīniàn*—**hold in mind a single thought**) of the **true scriptures** (*zhēnjīng*—**true scriptures**), and the **mountain deities** (*shāngshén*—**mountain spirits**) will guard and protect, while the beasts will naturally retreat, never harming the practitioner.

If one enters rivers and seas, **seeking treasures and precious things** (*cǎibǎo qiúzhēnjiàn*—**gathering treasures and seeking precious artifacts**), and encounters **malevolent winds** (*èfēng*—**evil winds**), causing the vessel to drift, then by **reciting and holding** (*shòu*—**receiving/holding**) this **true scripture** (*zhēnjīng*—**true scripture**) in accordance with the method, the winds will cease and the waves will still, allowing **safe arrival at shore** (*ānwěn dá'àn*—**securely reaching the shore**).

The blessings of the **true scripture** (*zhēnjīng*—**true scripture**) are not merely limited to **dispelling celestial calamities** (*xiāo tiānzāi*—**eliminating heavenly disasters**), ensuring **abundant harvests year after year** (*fēng suìnián*—**richness of years and harvests**), and **securing the populace** (*lìngshù ān*—**the commoners’ peace**). Even **sudden misfortunes** (*zùrán zhī biàn*—**sudden changes**), such as **mountains, rivers, winds, and waves** (*shānshuǐ fēngbō*—**mountains, waters, winds, and waves**) bringing peril, cannot harm the practitioner.

If one enters the mountains and forests and encounters **venomous and ferocious beasts** (*dú è wūshòu*—**poisonous, evil, and fierce beasts**), simply **retain a single thought** (*cúnxiǎng yīniàn*—**hold in mind a single thought**) of the **true scripture** (*zhēnjīng*—**true scripture**), never forgetting this **precious and wondrous method** (*bǎozhāng miàofǎ*—**treasured chapter and marvelous method**). The **mountain deities** (*shāngshén*—**mountain spirits**) will **guard and bestow protection** (*bǎowèi yòuhù*—**guard and protect**), and the beasts will naturally retreat, never harming the one who holds the scripture and enters the mountain.

If one enters the rivers and seas, **seeking treasures and precious artifacts** (*cǎibǎowù qiúzhēnjiàn*—**gathering treasures and seeking precious things**), and encounters **malevolent winds** (*èfēng*—**evil winds**), causing their **ships and boats** (*chuán fáng*—**vessels and boats**) to drift, then by following the **method of recitation and reception** (*rújīng zhōng shòushòu zhīfǎ*—**as the scripture teaches, the method of recitation and holding**) and **holding this true scripture** (*cúnxiǎng zhēnjīng*—**retaining this true scripture**), the great winds will subside and the waves will cease, allowing the **safe arrival of the practitioner’s vessel at shore** (*chuán wéi shāng’àn*—**the vessel’s secure arrival at shore**), with no harm befalling the one who holds the scripture.

Mountains and forests are **treacherous and obstructed** (*xiǎnzǔ*—**dangerous and blocked**), and **ferocious beasts and venomous insects** (*měngshòu dúchóng*—**fierce beasts and poisonous insects**) are **not to be approached** (*shì bùkě jìn*—**their nature forbids nearness**). If one encounters them, **injury is inevitable** (*bì zhì shānghài*—**certainly will be harmed**).

Yet, if one **retains a single thought** (*cúnxiǎng yīniàn*—**holds in mind a single thought**) of the **true scripture** (*zhēnjīng*—**true scripture**), merely **temporarily aligning with the Dao** (*bùguò zàn yǔ dào hé*—**nothing more than briefly merging with the Dao**), how can the beasts retreat so readily?

This is because **all beings—human and otherwise—originate from the same primordial *qi*** (*yuánqì*—**original *qi***), though they differ in **clarity and turbidity, completeness and partiality** (*qīngzhuó quánpiān*—**pure and impure, complete and incomplete**).

At the **beginning of heaven and earth** (*tiāndì zhī chū*—**when heaven and earth first formed**), humans and beasts coexisted in a **mixed and indistinct state** (*hùnchǔ rán*—**in a mingled, indistinct manner**), where **venomous insects and ferocious beasts** (*dúchóng èshòu*—**poisonous insects and evil beasts**) originally did not harm people.

Later, as **human hearts grew false** (*rén xīn jiàn jiǎ*—**human minds became deceptive**), the **distance between humans and beasts widened** (*qù èchóng wūshòu*—**separation from venomous insects and fierce beasts**), leading to the beasts’ harm toward humans.

If humans **constantly perform good deeds** (*cháng xíng hǎoshì*—**always do good deeds**), **nurture benevolent thoughts** (*cún hǎoxīn*—**hold good hearts**), and **revere and trust the true scriptures** (*jìngxìn zhēnjīng*—**respect and believe the true scriptures**), never forgetting them, they become **great virtuous ones** (*dà shànrén*—**great benevolent people**).

Thus, when entering mountains and forests, they **will not encounter venomous insects or fierce beasts** (*zì bù yùdú è wūshòu*—**naturally will not meet venomous, evil beasts**).

If, however, one **ordinarily indifferent and lacking in virtue** (*yōngcháng wú shàngǒng*—**habitually mediocre without virtuous deeds**), enters the mountain and **suddenly encounters venomous insects or fierce beasts** (*shìrán yùdú è wūshòu*—**unexpectedly meets venomous, evil beasts**), yet **does not covet life nor fear death** (*bù tānshēng pàsǐ*—**not greedy for life nor afraid of death**), **does not panic nor lose composure** (*bù huángjù bù sīxīn*—**not flustered nor distracted in mind**), but **trusts in the true teaching** (*wéi xìn zhèngfǎ*—**solely believes in the true law**), **remains steadfast without wavering** (*zhuān yī wú èr*—**single-minded and unshaken**), **focuses inwardly and contemplates silently** (*cāocún mòxiǎng*—**holds in mind and silently reflects**), **retaining a single thought** (*yīniàn zhēnjīng*—**a single thought of the true scripture**), their **mind and the Dao merge** (*xīn yǔ dào jù*—**heart and Dao become one**), and the **mountain deities guard and protect**, while the **venomous insects and fierce beasts naturally retreat**.

Beasts and insects are **stupid creatures** (*chǔnwù*—**dumb things**) of the Daoic path, though their **nature may be venomous and fierce** (*xìng suī dú è*—**nature though poisonous and evil**), they **kill and harm** (*hǎo shāngshā*—**love to kill and harm**). Yet, each has **objects of reverence, fears, and taboos** (*yǒu jìng, yǒu wèi, yǒu suǒjì*—**things they revere, fear, and avoid**).

Thus, **raptorial birds** (*zhìniǎo*—**fierce birds**) **revere the phoenix** (*zūn fèng*—**honor the *fèng* [august bird]**), **ferocious beasts** (*měngshòu*—**fierce beasts**) **bow to the qilin** (*cháo lín*—**pay homage to the *qílín* [auspicious unicorn]**), and **snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and other venomous insects** (*shéxiē wúgǒu zhūdúchóng*—**snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and other poisonous insects**) **fear cranes, *mànghóng* birds, herons, and *pèng* birds** (*wèi guàn mánghóng niǎo hè péng*—**dread the crane, *mànghóng* bird, heron, and *pèng* bird**), vanishing and refraining from their venom.

**Immortal Daoists** (*xiānzhēn*—**immortal sages**) **comprehend the mechanism of life and transformation** (*dá shēnghuà zhī jī*—**grasp the principle of life and change**) and **know the source of control** (*míng kèzhì zhī yuán*—**understand the origin of subjugation**). Even **a single incantation** (*yī zhòuyǔ*—**one incantation**) or **a single talisman** (*yī fúshuǐ*—**one talisman**) inscribed with water can **subdue venomous insects and serpents** (*zhì chóngshé dú*—**control poisonous insects and snakes**), **resolve the calamity of tiger ferocity** (*jiě hǔhěn è*—**alleviate the tiger’s ferocious disaster**), **reverse the winds and turn the heavens** (*fǎnfēng huìtiān*—**turn back the winds and return the heavens**), and much more. How much greater is the **power of the *Huángjīng*** (*Huángjīng*—**the *Huángjīng* [Yellow Scripture]**), which is **the sovereign of all teachings** (*wànfǎ zhī zōng*—**the root of all laws**) and **the progenitor of heaven and earth** (*tiāndì zhī zǔ*—**the parent of heaven and earth**)!

The **birth and death of all things** (*wànwù shēngsǎ*—**all beings’ life and death**) **depend upon heaven and earth**, which in turn **originate from the Great Dao** (*běn yú dàdào*—**stem from the Great Way**).

Thus, when one **retains a single thought** (*cúnxiǎng yīniàn*—**holds in mind a single thought**) of this scripture, they **need not fear beasts and insects** (*bùjù chóngshòu*—**not dread beasts and insects**). The **radiance of the scriptural treasure** (*fǎbǎo guāng*—**the light of the sacred treasure**) shines, and **all deities guard** (*zhūshén wèi*—**all spirits protect**), though the beasts may be **stupid**, their **nature still reveres the Dao** (*xìng yì zūndào*—**nature respects the Way**), **fearing heaven and revering the divine** (*wèi tiān jù shén*—**dreading heaven and fearing the spirits**), and thus **naturally retreat**.

Rivers, lakes, and seas—**winds and waves pose dangers** (*fēngbō wēixiǎn*—**winds and waves are perilous**), seemingly **the heavens’ wrath** (*tiān zhī nù*—**heaven’s anger**), and **escape seems difficult** (*shù suǒ nán táo*—**fate seems hard to evade**). Yet this scripture is **the king of all teachings** (*wànfǎ zhī wáng*—**the sovereign of all laws**), and **winds, thunder, hail, and lightning** (*fēngléi báo diàn*—**winds, thunder, hail, and lightning**) are **the heavens’ wondrous applications of divine power** (*tiān zhī miàoyòng shénwēi*—**heaven’s marvelous use of spiritual might**).

If one **holds and recites this true scripture** (*cúnxiǎng zhēnjīng*—**retains this true scripture**) in accordance with the method, they **align with heaven and the Dao** (*tóng yú tiān, tóng yú dào*—**become one with heaven and the Dao**), and **heaven itself will cease its wrath** (*tiān yì wèi zhī jìwēi*—**heaven will abate its might**), allowing the **winds to subside and the waves to still** (*fēng xī, làng zhǐ*—**winds cease, waves still**), and the **vessel to reach shore securely** (*chuán ānrán dá’àn*—**the ship safely arrives**).

**Verification and examination**: The *Yì* (易, *I Ching*) states: *"Treading upon a tiger, its jaws bare—disaster."* The Master Confucius said: *"Confronting a tiger barehanded and leaning upon a river in peril—die without regret."* Yet this scripture declares: *"If one retains a single thought and holds this true scripture in accordance with the method, beasts will retreat and winds and waves will cease."* The *Dàodéjīng* (道德经, *Tao Te Ching*) speaks: *"Those who align with the Dao: falcons do not strike, venomous insects do not sting, tigers and rhinoceroses dare not brandish their claws and horns, but hide their teeth and retreat their talons, not daring to harm."*

Many doubt that **Confucianism and Daoism contradict each other** (*rúdào xiāng bèi*—**

The efficacy of the scripture can yet deliver one from beasts and dispel venomous karmic influences—how could those who recite it be like the *Lu* and *Qi* states, where poisonous vapors arise?

**Chapter on Virtue and Power (续二十章):**
If in battle, when spears and halberds clash and blades interlock, one steadfastly retains the thought and silently recites this true scripture, all malevolent foes will retreat and disperse.

The benefits of this true scripture are not merely to dispel beasts, winds, and calamities! If in battle, when weapons are raised and spears and halberds clash, blades interlocking in the two armies’ confrontation, one steadfastly retains the thought and silently recites this true scripture—all the hostile foes assaulting our ranks will retreat and disperse.

**Verification:**
Weapons are instruments of slaughter. Battle is perilous. In the charge against enemies, arrows and stones fly, blades clash like roaring tigers—an irresolvable struggle. Yet if one steadfastly retains the thought and silently recites this true scripture, how, if one’s heart aligns with the Dao, could the malevolent foes not retreat?

The military classics say: *"The morale of three armies can be undermined; the resolve of a general can be shattered."* Silently reciting the true scripture, one seizes their spirit and subdues their vitality. This wondrous scripture’s power causes the enemy to lose their resolve, abandoning their will to fight, turning from evil to good, and naturally withdrawing and scattering.

"Battle" does not refer to armies numbering ten or twenty-five hundred—rather, when troops form ranks and confront one another in combat. "Spear combat" is not a matter of formal distinctions; "clash" and "interlock" differ little—only following the scripture’s phrasing of weapons meeting in battle. Steadfastly retaining the thought and silently reciting the true scripture is not for mere avoidance of slaughter—it is to devote one’s heart entirely, even facing death without abandoning the Dao.

*"All"* means "many." *"Malevolent foes"*—some interpret this as "malevolent" referring to evil persons, "foes" to bandits. This division is incorrect. It simply means hostile rebels.

*"Retreat and disperse"* means to withdraw and return, to scatter and depart each to their own.

**Resolving Doubts:**
The Venerable Lord transformed in Hu, besieged by the army of Yutian. The Heavenly Sovereign resided in the Celestial Palace, while the Heavenly Demon raised arms to challenge. The Buddha dwelled in the realm of Magadha, where the six kings of Kāliṅga rebelled. Confucius transformed the world, felling trees in Chen and erasing his tracks in Song. These were all great sages.

The Dao-body, the Dharma-body—constantly turning the true scripture, observing as if assailed by foes. Later, the Venerable Lord radiated the Dao-light, and Yutian submitted. The Sovereign displayed the Heavenly Light, and the Heavenly Demon withdrew. The Buddha manifested the Dharma-light, and the six kings converted. Confucius shone with virtue-light, and when he thrice plucked his lute and thrice sang in harmony, the people of Qi laid down their arms.

Thus, they retreated and dispersed.

Yet consider that many foes have sworn never to harm the virtuous. Many virtuous have faced peril without dying. Some doubt the case of the Song emperors Huizong and Qinzong, who, though devoted to the Dao, suffered humiliation in the north; or Liang Wu, who, though fond of Buddhism, starved to death in the Tai City. They assume the scripture’s efficacy is unproven.

Yet the three rulers’ devotion to Dao and Buddhism was merely in name, not genuine.

「When passions remain unsevered, one cannot govern the world with the Dao/Way, hence these calamities arise. If one truly embodies the Dao/Way and upholds faith in the scripture’s efficacy, even commoners—men and women alike—may avert such trials.

To doubt the deliverance from death and adversity or to disbelieve the scripture’s teachings is indeed erroneous. Alas, extolling unwavering integrity serves to inspire the world; reciting the scripture’s virtues stirs others to do good.

In essence, the scripture’s intent lies within the nature of our own inherent Dao/Way. When the six senses (六根) are assailed by thieves (贼) of discord, and one’s mind remains steadfast in the Dao/Way, the six thieves retreat. Thus, even in the face of armies, Heaven itself resolves the peril. Laozi proclaimed: *"Armies cannot harm."* Guanyin declared: *"The blade seeks only to sever flesh, yet justice prevails."* Their words are no deception—this is the natural efficacy of the scripture’s virtue.

**Continuation of the *Merits and Virtues* (功德品) in Chapter 21:**
If one finds oneself imprisoned in shackles (枷锁), with a purified mind and settled thoughts, yet ever mindful of this scripture, wrongs shall be redressed and liberation attained. The scripture’s benefits extend far beyond dispersing bandits and armies—even if one has wrongfully incurred guilt and lies in chains, by keeping the heart and mind clear, steadfast in reciting this true scripture, wrongs shall naturally be revealed and deliverance achieved.

**Verification:**
Prisons exist to confine the guilty. The rewards of virtue and retribution for vice are the immutable laws of Heaven. Once imprisoned for a crime, one cannot simply escape—how then does it say that mindfulness of this scripture brings immediate liberation?

The phrase *"wrongs shall be redressed"* (冤枉自伸) implies that such a person, in their ordinary life, must inherently be virtuous. Perhaps in a past existence they incurred karmic debts (宿世充愆), or in this life they face misfortune (今生运限); or they may have been wrongfully accused (误失过失, 他人挂误), or drawn into another’s crime (先亡连逮, 救人被陷). When suddenly cast into prison, all such cases are unjust.

If one neither blames Heaven nor resents others, enduring hardship with equanimity (素患难, 行乎患难), free from malice or ill-will (绝无意想), then one’s mind is purified, thoughts settled, and devotion to this true scripture is genuine. Heaven aids the virtuous—wrongs are naturally exposed, requiring no defense, and justice is swiftly rendered. There is no prolonged suffering, for Heaven does not permit enduring injustice; liberation comes at once.

**Definitions:**
Prison (牢狱): *Lao* (牢) refers to confinement; *yù* (狱) refers to awaiting trial. Modern terms like *jianyáng* (监仓, prison cells) and *pùchǎng* (铺厂, detention centers) vary in severity, but both are places where criminals reside. The two characters do not strictly differentiate—*jiā* (枷) and *suǒ* (锁) are restraints for the guilty, arising from unforeseen circumstances (变故).

Some say: *"Lao" derives from cattle (牛), "yù" from dogs (犬).* If one refrains from slaughtering cattle and dogs, prison shall be forever avoided. Yet this merely counsels against killing for sustenance (不食牛犬) and restrains the tongue (勿纵口), lest one invite calamity through gluttony (以味招祸).

Beyond the scripture’s core teachings, this is an ancillary note.

The scripture’s benefits include redressing wrongs and granting liberation—not only for those unjustly imprisoned but also for those who, in ordinary life, have committed crimes yet repent sincerely, harboring no resentment. If one steadfastly relies on the scripture’s power, without faltering, liberation shall come.

King Wen of Zhou (文王) attained sainthood through the Dao/Way. Imprisoned in *Yǔlǐ* (羑里), he studied the *Yijing* (《易经》) and was pardoned. Gongye Chang (公冶长) aspired to the Dao/Way and became a sage. Though bound in chains (缧绁), he too found release. Xu Shen Gong (徐神公) and Zhang Ziyang (张紫阳) achieved transcendence through the Dao/Way. Despite the torments of *Chāngyì* (昌邑) imprisonment and the Three Refined Ones’ (三配) afflictions, their devoted practice of the supreme Dao/Way and profound transmission of *The Awakening to Reality* (《悟真》) secured their deliverance.

It is not only sages who are liberated—even the foolish, if they cast aside worldly attachments (除去维念), place absolute faith in this scripture, shall escape the bonds of prison. The misfortunes of *lao* and *yù* shall dissolve.

**Dispelling Doubts:**
In the remote antiquity, there were no guilty criminals nor prisons. The Yellow Emperor (轩辕) captured *Chīyóu* (蚩尤), binding him with fetters (桎梏) and marking the earth to restrain him—thus the concept of prisons emerged. By the Three Dynasties (三代), the system of imprisonment was fully established.

This scripture was revealed before the age of great calamities (浩劫), when the Primordial Beginning (元始) spoke of it in Heaven. How then does it mention prisons? The truth is that in every age (劫劫), in every place, there are virtuous and wicked. The wicked naturally incur karmic retribution (孽), and the logic of prisons is already inherent.

The scripture encompasses all dharmas (万法), benefiting all sentient beings (群动) eternally. Its principles are exhaustive—it foretells the power to liberate from guilt.

The scripture declares: *"Mindful of Guanyin’s power, chains shall swiftly depart."* Confucian texts say: *"The virtuous man contemplates retribution."* The *Great Yijing* (《大易》) states: *"No calamity comes without cause."* How could these not speak of prisons? Thus, the scripture is not a teaching of recent times—it is an ancient, profound revelation (无始玄章).

In summary, a single mindful thought aligns with virtue (福堂); a single thought of selfishness invites karmic bonds (业狱). If one’s desires and delusions persist unchecked, a pit of karmic debts is dug, and prison becomes inevitable.

Mencius said: *"The difference between humans and beasts is but slight."* *Lao* (牢) derives from cattle (牛), *yù* (狱) from dogs (犬). The creator of these characters held deep meaning. Let all present and future beings exert effort and place unwavering faith in this scripture—through every age and place, prisons shall be forever avoided.

**Continuation of the *Merits and Virtues* (功德品) in Chapter 22:**
If one is tormented by malevolent spirits, demons, or thieves (邪精鬼贼), yet recites this true scripture in accordance with its methods, the malevolent shall flee, and one shall find peace.

The divine efficacy of the *Jade Scripture* (玉经) extends beyond liberating from prison—if one is afflicted by all manner of malevolent spirits, demons, or thieves (邪魔精怪鬼贼), and recites this true scripture as prescribed, all malevolent spirits, demons, and thieves shall retreat and vanish, leaving one in natural security and tranquility.

**Verification:**
*"If one is"* (若为) is equivalent to *"as one is"* (如为). Malevolent spirits, demons, or thieves (邪精鬼贼) encompass all that is not upright (不正)—spirits that exploit supernatural abilities to wreak havoc (通灵而逞妖异者为精), malevolent entities of the unseen realm (阴之灵者为鬼), and those that harm humans or things (伤人害物曰贼).

Some say *"贼"* refers to human malefactors. Yet earlier it was stated that armies and wicked bandits (军阵恶贼) all disperse. How then could *"贼"* here mean human wrongdoers? Essentially, malevolent spirits, demons, or thieves (邪魔妖精鬼怪) seize opportunities and exploit weaknesses, entering through the flaws of those who are not virtuous.

Their origins are unknown—from whence they come; their departures are unfathomable—whither they go. They strike in darkness, inflicting harm without warning, hence they are called *guǐzéi* (鬼贼, demonic thieves).」

From the celestial *Tianmo* (天魔) down to earthly *tujing* (土精), mountain *wāngliang* (山魍魉), aquatic *shuàiyì* (水怪异), arboreal *mèi* (木魅) and metallic *jīng* (金精), fiery *yāo* (火妖) and herbaceous *yì* (草异), the *jing* (精) of birds and beasts, the anomalies of ice and embers (*bīngtàn zhī guài*), and the malevolent *chīniè* (魑孽) and spectral *guīlíng* (鬼灵)—these malevolent entities are countless.

Their afflictions manifest as hurling tiles and bricks, startling fowl and canines, demanding sacrifices, and disturbing households. They may cause one to be disoriented, spiritless and dazed, raving without cause, fleeing in lamentation, bewildered and insensible, capering and vomiting, roaring in lustful depravity, drunkenly deranged, losing one’s faculties, unable to rest or eat, perpetually anxious day and night—living in perpetual unrest, dying with lingering attachments. This is the suffering of *zhòngkǔ* (众苦).

*"Jiā"* (加) means to inflict calamity upon others.

It is said: *"As the law prescribes, recite this true scripture."* Yet if these malevolent spirits and *zhòngkǔ* (众苦) afflict one, how can simply reciting the scripture as prescribed dispel them?

*"As the law prescribes"* does not mean mere ritual recitation—it is the unity of *yī* (一, singularity) with the mind and the Dao’s truth. When this scripture is chanted according to the proper method of recitation, with reverent gazing, bowing, and intoning, all malevolent spirits and thieves will retreat.

Alternatively, it is said: *"As the law prescrices, recite the true scripture"*—meaning a Daoist practitioner should recite the scripture on behalf of the afflicted. Thus, all malevolent entities will retreat, and the afflicted will naturally find peace, without need for talismans, elixirs, or exorcistic incantations. Upon hearing the scripture, they will flee, and the suffering will cease, leaving none afflicted.

It is said that the Ancestor Celestial Master subdued all demons with the law. The *Xuandi* (玄帝) cultivated the True Way, annihilating all malevolent *jingyé* (精邪) and governing both human and ghostly realms. The *Sà Zhēnrén* (萨真人) expounded the Dao, banishing evil spirits. The *Lǎojūn* (老君) subdued the celestial demon. The *Fó Fàn* (佛梵) invoked spells to conquer demons.

The scholar-official *Fàn Wénzhènggōng* (范文正公), after a night on the battlefield, heard only the crowing of a rooster—no ghosts dared act malevolently. *Chéngzǐ* (程子) subdued the *Dàtóuguǐ* (大头鬼), and even when the ghosts moved his bed, his mind remained undisturbed, and the spirits withdrew in hiding.

Thus it is said:
*"When the Dao is exalted, dragons and tigers submit;
When virtue is profound, ghosts and spirits revere."*

To recite the true scripture as the law prescribes—this secret canon, the most sacred utterance—reveals the unbreakable mechanism by which ghosts and spirits are vanquished. How could any malevolent spirit or demonic thief dare not retreat?

**Resolving Doubts:**
Essentially, within the human body, the *sānshī* (三尸), *wǔqióng* (五穷), *qīpò* (七魄), the *qīqíng* (七情), and *liùyù* (六欲), along with all manner of delusive thoughts and fantasies, and the myriad dark inclinations—all are manifestations of malevolent spirits and thieves. If one awakens to the luminous void and wields the wisdom-sword to slay demons, exhausting all desires, then malevolent spirits and thieves will retreat.

**Chapter Twenty-Three of the *Gōngdé Pǐn* (功德品) – Continuation:**

If one seeks descendants, and reverently upholds and recites this scripture as the law prescribes, the Celestial Sovereign commands the *Tiāncháo* (天曹), who then inspect the *Dānjí* (丹籍) of the Nine Ranks. Among the *sìguǒ xiānrén* (四果仙人), when fate and destiny align, they descend and incarnate to become their child—endowed with eloquence, wisdom, and noble status among mortals.

The efficacy of this scripture is not merely to subdue malevolent forces. If one, afflicted by childlessness, seeks descendants and upholds this scripture with reverence as prescribed, the Celestial Sovereign commands the *Tiāncháo* to examine the *Dānshū Xiānjí* (丹书仙籍). Among the Nine Ranks, the *sìguǒ xiānrén* (四果仙人), when their cosmic cycles and numerical destinies converge, descend and incarnate to become their child.

The child born to one who recites this scripture for descendants will be gifted with eloquence, wisdom, and intelligence, attaining noble status among humanity.

*"Qí"* (祈) means to pray and supplicate the gods in seeking.

Sometimes, others pray for one; other times, one seeks for oneself. Whether one has descendants or not depends on Heaven’s decree—if it cannot be sought, it cannot be sought. Of the three gravest offenses against filial piety, childlessness is the greatest. One must seek descendants, for all who possess *xuèqì* (血气) are capable of procreation.

Perhaps one has exhausted *yīndé* (阴德) or incurred Heaven’s wrath; perhaps one’s *yáng* (阳) and *yīn* (阴) are misaligned, or one’s fate clashes with solitude; perhaps the fetus is weak or one harms oneself in anger, resulting in childlessness.

Yet human resolve can reverse Heaven’s decree—through utmost sincerity and divine resonance, none will remain childless. Thus, descendants can be sought.

*"Sìxī"* (嗣息) means *"sì"* (嗣, to continue) and *"xī"* (息, breath). Some say *"sì"* means to bind, as in binding the ancestral line like a continuous thread. Others say *"sì"* means to govern, overseeing the transmission of family lineage, as recorded in ancestral tablets. *"Xī"* (息) refers to children who continue the ancestral line, like the unceasing inhalation and exhalation of breath.

Moreover, the true breath is the root of life and death—if breath ceases, *qì* (气) vanishes. Having descendants ensures the continuity of sacrifices, hence *"xī"* (息). *"Tàidǐ xī"* (太抵息) refers to the mind itself. With descendants, all concerns are fulfilled, and the mind finds rest—thus it is called *"xī"* (息).

The sages of the Three Teachings all had descendants. How can one not recognize the weight of progeny?

To uphold this scripture with reverence is to revere the scripture itself. Some say one must personally revere it—which is incorrect. The *Tiāncháo* are those who create destinies and oversee the *Xiānjí* (仙籍). The Nine Ranks consist of the upper three *shèng* (乘), the middle three, and the lower three—totaling nine.

The *Shìjìng* (释经) states: *"The Nine-Ranked Lotus is the parent."* The Buddha, Bodhisattvas, *Yuánjué* (圆觉), *Shèngwén* (声闻), and *Āluóhàn* (阿罗汉), as well as those in the four *zhān* (禅) stages, also belong to the Nine Ranks.

The *sìguǒ xiānrén* (四果仙人)—*Xūduōhàn* (须陀洹), *Sītuǒhán* (斯陀含), *Āluóhàn* (阿罗汉), and *Ānàhàn* (阿那含)—descend and incarnate. For the Daoist or Buddhist to take human form is considered descending to the mortal realm, hence *"jiàngdié xiàshēng"* (降谪下生).

*"Cái"* (才) refers to extraordinary talents; *"biàn"* (辩) refers to unparalleled eloquence.

The light shines without failing.
The wisdom awakens without obstruction.

Among mortals, the most honored are not necessarily those who become rulers, ministers, or teachers—
but those who embody **virtue** and the **Way**, perfecting themselves as exemplary sons.
No greater honor than the **Way**,
No greater nobility than **virtue**.
Even the Son of Heaven cannot make them his subject,
Nor can the feudal lords make them their friend.
They assist in governance, nurture the people,
And aid in the completion of all things.
Across countless generations, they are revered,
And across the Three Realms, they are held in esteem.
Thus, they are the most honored among mortals.

If one reveres this **sutra** as law,
Reciting it for oneself or seeking descendants through it,
Though its effects are manifest, one cannot reckon the days—
Only by truly honoring the **sutra**,
Confessing faults with sincerity,
And remaining steadfast from beginning to end,
As though gazing upon the Jade Emperor,
With utmost reverence for this sacred **dharma**,
Will divine efficacy and spiritual power unfold unseen,
Turning fate and altering destiny—
Descendants will naturally arise.

Even mortal heroes gain offspring through merit.
Those who truly believe in the **sutra** and turn the **Dharma Wheel**,
As the functional pillars of heaven and earth,
How could their descendants not prosper?
If one reveres this **sutra** yet fails to secure descendants,
It must be that their sincerity is insufficient,
Or they have not followed the **sutra** from start to finish.

Let all mortals take heed and verify the **sutra’s** divine efficacy.

**Functional Merit Chapter (Continuation, Twenty-Fourth Section):**
If a woman in her critical month of childbirth
Recites this true **sutra** according to the law,
She will give birth safely, mother and child both unharmed,
And bear children of fortune and **virtue**, beloved and respected by all.

The **sutra’s** divine power does more than merely ensure descendants.
If a woman in her critical month of childbirth
Recites this true **sutra** according to the law,
She will deliver swiftly and safely,
Mother and child both unscathed,
And bear children of auspicious fortune and **virtue**, beloved and honored by all.

Once a woman is married into her husband’s family, she is called a **wife**.
The "critical month" refers to the time of childbirth,
When life and death hang in the balance—
Thus, it is called "facing peril."
Reciting the true **sutra** according to the law:
Whether before birth, when she herself observes a pure fast and recites the **sutra**,
Or during birth, when others recite it for her,
She will deliver safely,
With no complications at the hour of birth,
The child born without harm to mother or child,
Both emerging smoothly and in good health—
A benefit to both.

**Fortune** refers to those of wealth, nobility, longevity, and auspicious appearance.
**Virtue** refers to the saintly, loyal, filial, and kind—those of moral excellence.
**Children**, whether male or female, bear **fortune** and **virtue**.
**Beloved and respected** means they are approachable yet not familiar,
Near yet not to be trifled with—
All draw near to them, praise them, and envy them.
This is called **love**.
Yet, when seen from afar, reverence arises;
When approached, laziness fades;
Without words, trust is given;
Without movement, respect is shown.
This is called **respect**.

**Clarification:**
It is fitting for a man to be beloved and respected.
But how can a woman be so?
If her **fortune** is complete and her conduct virtuous,
If she does not weep or jest,
If she is dignified, speaks little,
Moves seldom, and does not laugh,
If she is mature beyond her years,
Grave yet pure in adulthood,
And unchanging until death—
All will love her as kin,
Respect her as elders.
This love is without familiarity;
They envy her **fortune** and **virtue**—
A rarity in the world.

**Verification:**
Mother and child both safe.

The *Shijing*’s chapter *"Shēngmín"* praises Jiāng Yù in giving birth to Hòuxī, saying:
*"The firstborn was born like a strike—no calamity, no harm."*
Jiāng Yù possessed **virtue**, so her firstborn emerged as easily as a lamb—unharmed, with mother and child both at peace.
The *Exegesis* states: *"Mother and child parted early."*
The *Dao Scriptures* declare: *"At childbirth, there is joy; seated on grass, there is no peril."*
The merit of reciting the *Scriptures* responds like an echo.

Now, the *Huángjīng* spreads throughout the world, and many recite it.
Yet women in childbirth may suffer:
Some deliver prematurely before their time,
Some face calamity or peril,
Some encounter ghostly births or omens,
Some endure misfortune or familial strife—
Though many achieve mother and child’s safety, few attain both fully;
Some suffer dual harm as well.

Some say reciting the *Scriptures* may bring no benefit,
Yet the True Law is rare to encounter.
Many do not revere this *Scripture* or know its blessings;
Some hear its name but do not honor it;
Some pay hollow respect without recitation,
Some recite but begin with fervor and end in neglect;
Some omit or confuse passages,
Some recite carelessly, mispronouncing words, distorting phrases,
Misinterpreting meaning—
Though they may offer repentance, they fail to gain the full merit of the *Scripture*.
All these are self-deception, failing to meet the *Scripture*’s power,
Thus concluding that recitation is fruitless—
This is blasphemy against the Law.

Alas, the True Law must be upheld,
And filial piety is hard to repay.
Rescuing suffering, benefiting life—
This is the urgent duty of those who seek the *Way*.
If we teach the world to revere and recite this *Scripture*,
Then mothers and children will be at peace,
Childbirth perils will be averted,
And virtuous sons and daughters will be born—
All will bear marks of **fortune** and **virtue**,
And the True *Dao* will endure forever.
The merit is boundless.

Let those who study the *Scripture* take heed.

**Continuation of Chapter Twenty-Five: The Merit of Virtue**

If one seeks to attain office and advance in rank,
to secure noble titles and abundant stipends,
to be honored by the sovereign—
if one recites and upholds this *True Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,
then one shall be granted promotions in duty,
one’s descendants shall prosper in honor and rank,
and this lineage shall endure through the ages.

The benefits of the *Jade Scripture* extend far beyond mere prosperity in childbirth!
If one seeks to attain office and advance in rank,
to secure noble titles and abundant stipends,
to be honored by the sovereign—
if one recites and upholds this *True Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,
then one shall be entrusted with official duties,
ascend in rank and station,
and one’s descendants shall prosper in honor and rank,
enduring through the ages without cessation.

**Seeking Office:**
Even without office, one may obtain it.
**Advancement in Rank:**
*Advancement* means promotion.
If one’s station is humble, one seeks to rise to higher office and noble duty.
**Titles:**
Titles are conferred upon officials.
**Stipends:**
Stipends are the remuneration given.
**Abundant and Auspicious:**
*Heng* signifies prosperity, ease, and joy—auspicious and beneficial.
**Fulfillment:**
*Da* means to achieve one’s desires, to succeed in one’s aspirations.
**Honored by the Sovereign:**
To be distinguished is called *noble*; titles and stipends are abundant, and one gains the sovereign’s favor, administering affairs and receiving the ruler’s recognition.
The harmony between ruler and subject has always been rare.
To be noble and honored by the sovereign means the subject’s rank is not in vain—this is true fulfillment.
*Alternatively:* To be favored by a wise and enlightened ruler.

*This Scripture* is not redundant; its phrasing is deliberate.

**Official Duties:**
*Job* refers to the responsibilities of office, each with its designated tasks.
*Matter* refers to governance.
**Promotion:**
To be reassigned to a better post or relieved of trivial duties to assume a position of importance.
**Descendants’ Honor and Rank:**
Some inherit office and stipends through generations,
or receive patronage for their children and grandchildren,
enjoying wealth, security, and prestige,
illuminating ancestors and benefiting posterity—
both honored and prosperous, enduring through the ages.
Though not equal to the heavens and earth in permanence,
they endure eternally, blessing future generations,
with grace extending unbroken.
Even across many generations, this is considered enduring.

As with **Confucius the Sage’s** supreme virtue,
or the **Celestial Master’s** divine transformations,
his descendants received imperial appointments through the ages—
this is true, unbroken honor and rank.

**Titles and stipends** originate from the imperial court’s official appointments.
If they cannot be obtained through merit,
one may follow established qualifications for advancement.
If advancement is unattainable through merit,
how much more so must one study diligently—
scholars must master texts, warriors must know warfare.
Learning and achievements cannot be borrowed;
how then can one seek advancement?

Officials are appointed for their virtue,
and stipends are granted to nourish the worthy.
Those of great virtue must attain their rightful position and name.
If one upholds this *True Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,
recites its sacred words,
and follows the Sage’s teachings,
one’s heart aligns with the heavens,
and one’s actions harmonize with the *Way*—
this is the mark of a truly virtuous person.

Some are praised in speech,
others commended in deed;
without titles, they are granted offices,
without rank, they receive stipends,
or their existing offices are elevated—
this is the natural course of employing the worthy.

By virtue, one attracts the worthy.
If they refuse such honors—
as **Broad Achievement**, **Yin Shou**, **Chao You**, or **Yan Guang**—
whether as imperial preceptors or honored guests of the state,
how can it be said that the virtuous cannot attain titles and stipends?
As with **Han’s Zhuge Liang**,
or **Jin-Tang’s Jingyang, Li Bei, and Hai Dan**,
all were men of the *Way* who held office.

The *Scripture* speaks of seeking office—
what more need be said?

**Heavenly Titles** are noble indeed,
and they belong to us inherently.
Ascending beyond the mundane to sainthood,
advancing in virtue step by step,
manifesting divine transformations to attain immortality—
this is unbroken through kalpas.

The *Dao De Jing* says:
*"To die yet not perish."*
The *Transmissions of the Immortals* declare:
*"A child is born, and the child bears grandchildren."*

The *Way* is exalted, virtue is noble,
and the transmissions of the immortals are boundless.
If one does not covet worldly fame or transient gain,
but cultivates the **Heavenly Title’s** true nobility,
transcending the ordinary to approach sainthood,
rising above the dust to attain immortality—
enduring forever without end,
this is truly to uphold the *True Scripture* in accordance with its precepts.

**Continuation of Chapter Twenty-Six: The Merit of Wealth**

If one desires to amass abundant wealth,
and upholds this *True Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,
then treasures shall overflow,
clothing and food shall come naturally,
and blessings shall flow to descendants,
passing to future generations.

The benefits of this *Scripture* extend far beyond fulfilling worldly ambitions for office!
If one desires abundant wealth for one’s family,
and upholds this *True Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,
then riches, treasures, and precious curiosities shall fill to overflowing,
clothing and food shall be plentiful and refined,
naturally abundant without effort,
with blessings extending to descendants,
passing to future generations.

**Wealth:**
*Resource*—what one’s family requires.
*Alternatively:* That which one relies upon, benefiting all.
Same as *capital*.
**Treasures:**
*Wealth*—the wealth one possesses.
*Also:* Wealth as a resource.
**Abundant:**
*Yin*—fullness, completeness.
**Rich:**
When a household’s prosperity reaches its peak,
and resources are fully sufficient.
**Uphold:**
*Delight in reverence* is *uphold*;
to guard, observe, and recite.
**Treasures:**
*Wealth*—the *wealth* of goods.
*Precious*—jade, gold, silver, gems, rare curiosities,
ornaments, silks, and treasures of extraordinary value.
**Overflowing:**
*Chong*—fully sufficient.
*Yi*—abundantly full.
**Clothing and food naturally:**
Without toil, naturally abundant.
**Blessings flow to descendants:**
*Reg* signifies auspiciousness.
Grace extends far, blessing generation after generation—
thus, *blessings flow to descendants*.
**Passing to future generations:**
Not limited to one’s own children,
but transmitted through the ages,
with later generations eternally enjoying peace and honor.

**Resolving Doubts:**
**Confucius** said:
*"Wealth, if it can be sought, even a lowly driver I would serve."*
If it cannot be sought, then follow what one loves.
He strongly states that wealth is not to be pursued—
yet here it is said that if one seeks abundance by upholding this *Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,
one shall attain prosperity and blessings for descendants.
This suggests that wealth *can* be sought.

**Zi Xia** said:
*"The Master heard: Wealth and nobility are decreed by Heaven."*
Though wealth is desirable, fate governs it,
and Heaven truly holds dominion—
how then can it be sought?
Yet though wealth is subject to fate,
the ancient scholars said:
*"Wealth and nobility are the rewards for virtue’s culmination,
a repayment for merit."*

If one upholds and recites this *Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,
speaking the words of Heaven with reverence as though addressing the August Sky,
this is how virtue earns its blessings.

「The *Classics* say: *"Joy belongs to the virtuous gentleman,
blessings follow those who tread the peaceful Way."*
This is what is meant.

Some say: *"Great Yu was a sage,
who drank little and ate plainly,
wore coarse garments and lived in humble dwellings,
yet found sweetness only in simplicity and restraint."*
The Daoist teachings state: *"To learn the Dao, one must embrace poverty to the marrow of the bones."*
This suggests that reciting the *Scripture* can bring wealth—
a claim that may entice those who crave prosperity.

Yu’s own frugality was the heart of a sage who did not hoard virtue for himself.
The Daoists’ pursuit of poverty was to free the mind from worldly burdens.
Though wealth *can* be sought and obtained,
this is the intended effect of upholding the *Scripture*.

The *Buddha’s Scriptures* say: *"All that one seeks with sincere intent
shall be fulfilled and satisfied."*
Both teachings open vast pathways of expedience—
boundless blessings and benefits,
where requests are answered and wishes fulfilled.
If one doubts, hesitates, or falters—
beginning with diligence yet ending in neglect—
if one’s heart is not upright,
lacks steadfast faith, or is not utterly sincere,
then even seeking shall yield no result.
Let those who observe the *Scripture* understand this well.

Consider: all things are inherently complete within me.
There are those who are naturally wealthy without effort.
Yet why do people chase after fame and gain,
compete in superficial luxuries,
indulge in passions and desires,
and mistake falsehood for truth?

The poor suffer in distress,
yet cannot uphold the Great Way,
nor recite the true *Scriptures*.
The rich indulge in extravagance,
yet cannot abandon worldly wisdom and profit
to follow the teachings of the Law,
willing to age and die in their folly,
losing the wealth they were born with.

Laozi said: *"Gold and jade fill the hall,
yet none can guard them;
wealth and rank bring arrogance,
and one invites ruin upon oneself."*
This warns against pursuing externals while neglecting the inner self.

Now it is said that reciting the *Scripture* can bring wealth—
to urge people to abandon their superficial pursuit of riches
and instead honor the *Scripture*.
Ah, truly, reciting the *Scripture* has its effect.
If one lacks sincerity and reverence,
one may only invite transgression.
Let those who observe the *Scripture* be cautious.

**Chapter 27 of *The Merits and Virtues* (continued):**
If one is afflicted by malevolent stars,
suffering hardship in life and death,
and yet recites this *Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,
then these malevolent stars shall retreat,
bringing forth auspicious fortune instead.

The benefits of this *Scripture* extend far beyond mere wealth—
if one’s life or fate is troubled by malevolent stars,
if one lies in bed with restless sleep,
and yet recites this *Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,
then these malevolent stars shall transform their ill fortune into good,
and retreat, bringing forth auspicious fortune.

The Master **Chisongzi** said: *"The people are orphaned and destitute,
each bearing a star upon their brow."*
Yet the stars that shine upon them bring either fortune or calamity—
fortune brings a thousand blessings,
while calamity portends ill omens and punishments.
Those beneath the Three Luminaries must always avoid such ill influences.
Malevolent stars are the stars of calamity—
such as **Luohe** (羅睺), **Jidu** (計都), **Tianpo** (天破), **Tianku** (天哭), **Tianbai** (天敗), and **Tianrui** (天退), among others.

**Photo** (照) refers to when stars align with one’s destiny,
fate, or home—whether at birth, during one’s lifespan,
or in the celestial divisions of one’s abode.
**Kun** (困) means one’s desires are not fulfilled,
pressed down and unable to flourish.
**Ku** (苦) refers to poverty, illness, or danger
that directly afflicts the body.
**Kun and ku in bed and pillow** simply mean
one is trapped in misfortune,
unable to rest or sleep in peace,
lying in bed with no comfort.

Another saying: *"Bed and pillow are disturbed by fear."*
These malevolent stars encompass many—
all celestial omens of calamity that align with one’s destiny,
fate, or home, and all stars of ill fortune.

**Returning and descending auspicious fortune** means
that when malevolent stars shine upon one,
misfortune prevails and no blessings follow.
Yet if one recites this *Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,
the sacred verses shall take effect,
the ill omens shall become auspicious,
and all malevolent stars that afflict one
shall not only fail to bring misfortune,
but shall instead withdraw in silence,
bestowing blessings and fortune,
and descending auspicious fortune.

The influence of stars upon destiny and fate
is inherently fixed.
How then can reciting the *Scripture* cause malevolent stars to bring auspicious fortune?

Heaven and humanity share the same principle—
above and below are interconnected,
and the mechanism of response is swift as light and shadow.
King **Shuanggong of Song** had three sayings of a ruler,
one of which was: *"Retreat when the star **Yinghuo** (荧惑) appears."*

It is not only rulers who can move Heaven—
a filial wife, bearing grief, could bring three years of drought;
a lowly servant, pleading sincerely, could summon frost in the sixth month.
Even common folk, man or woman,
can sway Heaven and Earth,
and stir the spirits and deities—
only fearing their sincerity may not be complete.

If one’s sincerity reaches Heaven,
even a single word can win the trust of the divine.
One need not speak to influence the transformations of fate—
how much more so when the *Scripture* is the essence of Heaven and Earth,
the source from which the Three Luminaries draw their light?

If one recites this *Scripture* in accordance with its precepts,
honoring the sacred verses of the Most Holy,
and fully embracing the profound mysteries of the enlightened,
then malevolent stars shall disperse,
auspicious fortune shall arise,
and ill fate shall turn to blessing.

Humans are all the same—
those who follow the path of virtue shall meet fortune,
those who oppose it shall meet calamity.
*The *Central Admonition Scripture* (中诫经)* says:
*"When stars shine upon a person,
fortune or calamity is self-summoned—
doing great good, the star’s light shall be manifest;
doing no good nor evil, its light shall be faint;
committing minor faults, its light shall scatter;
committing great faults, its light shall vanish.
If malevolent stars afflict one,
it is because of one’s faults—
then ill fate shall respond.
If one is faultless,
the omens shall be averted.
Goodness shall drive away calamity,
and blessings shall descend."*

The *Scripture* says: *"A single thought of evil
summons malevolent stars and vengeful spirits;
a single thought of good
summons auspicious stars and joyous clouds."*
The signs of blessing or ruin
depend upon the purity of one’s thoughts.

Even in times of great peril and disaster,
if one truly upholds this *Scripture*,
the calamities shall retreat—
and yet, are there not some afflictions,
like restless sleep and sudden misfortunes,
that may not be entirely dispelled?

King **Tai Jia** said: *"Heaven creates calamities,
yet they can still be defied."*
This is the same meaning.

If one can propagate the Dao,
praise the nurturing of all things,
and silently turn the true *Scripture*,
entering its divine mysteries to reach cosmic transformation,
then one shall align with Heaven and Earth in virtue,
with the sun and moon in radiance,
with the four seasons in order,
and with the spirits and deities in fortune and calamity.
One shall guide the transformations of fate,
forever transcend the mundane,
and even the spirits and deities shall not dare to obstruct—
life and death shall have no dominion,
and stars shall not be able to confine or limit one.

Let those who observe this *Scripture* strive earnestly.

**Chapter 28 of *The Merits and Virtues* (continued):**
If one’s fate is marked by transgressions,
and they should fall into the hells,
their names recorded in the evil ledgers,
then let their parents, teachers, and elders,
their spouses and children,
recite this *Scripture* for them,
or establish a Daoist hall for their repose,
offering banners, flowers, and provisions.
Thus shall the departed’s evil record be erased,
their spirit reborn in a pure land,
and all suffering beings be liberated together,
receiving this triumphant blessing—
all shall ascend to Heaven above.»

The merits and virtues of this *Scripture* do not merely avert sins in life—
if one’s fate is marked by transgressions and they die prematurely,
their soul and spirit shall descend into the hells,
their names recorded in the ledgers of evil deeds.
Then let their parents, teachers, and elders,
their spouses and children,
recite this *Scripture* for the departed,
or establish a *Dao* hall for their liberation,
offering banners, flowers, and provisions.
Thus shall the departed’s evil records be erased,
their spirit reborn in a pure land,
and all who suffer in the same hells, the same deaths,
the same ledgers of sin—
all shall rely on the *Scripture*’s virtue,
receiving deliverance and salvation,
and attain this supreme and wondrous *Law*’s blessings,
ascending to Heaven above.

*"Command over"* (*命过*)—this means dying before one’s allotted lifespan.
*"Descend into the hells"* (*应入地狱*)—whether from sins committed in past lives or this one,
one must enter the hells and suffer retribution.
The hells include *Yingdu* (酆都), *Iron Enclosure* (铁围), the *Nine Hells*, the *Eighteen Hells*,
the *Twenty-Four Hells*, the *Thirty-Six Hells*, the *Seventy-Two Hells*,
and the *Hell of No Return* (无间), among others.

*"Recorded in the ledgers of evil"* (*注名恶籍*)—their names are inscribed
in the black registers of misdeeds for retribution.
*"Parents, teachers, and elders"* (*父母师长*)—these are the departed’s parents,
their masters, or their senior kin.
*"Spouses and children"* (*夫妻男女*)—whether the departed was a woman or a man,
they must have had a husband or wife;
if not, then their sons, daughters, or other male and female relatives remain.
*"Recite this Scripture for the departed"* (*当为亡人持念是经*)—this is for the living kin
to uphold and chant this *Scripture* on their behalf.
*"Establish a Dao hall"* (*或安置道场*)—to arrange and consecrate a *Dao* hall,
following the *Dao*’s methods to eliminate karmic sins—hence, a *Dao* hall.
*"Banners and floral offerings"* (*旛花供养*)—the *banner* (*旛*) proclaims the sacred names endlessly,
inscribed on long scrolls, hoisted on tall poles to sway the four directions,
spreading radiant light. *Flowers* (*花*) are presented—all rare blooms—to welcome the sacred spirits.
In Heaven, natural banners and flags unfurl, celestial flowers bloom in splendor,
displaying auspicious light. In the mortal world, banners are placed in the *Dao* hall
to signify solemnity and invite divine aid.
*"Provisions"* (*供养*)—*supply* (*供*) means to offer reverently;
*nourish* (*养*) means to provide food and drink in veneration.
Heavenly beings feast on pure and wondrous *Law*—the celestial kitchen’s refined offerings,
solemn and respectful. The world’s five or ten offerings
merely eliminate the five aggregates, remove five sufferings,
restrain five pleasures, abandon ten evils,
contemplate ten truths, and dwell in ten virtues—
to honor the luminous spirits,
revere the true *Law*,
and uphold sacred texts—this is true veneration.
Yet today, offering only food, flowers, fruits, and rare delicacies
without genuine reverence is but superficial.
The *Scripture*’s true offerings are those of sincere, natural devotion.

Thus shall the departed’s evil records be erased,
their spirit reborn in a pure land.
A single turning of this *Scripture*,
or the establishment of a *Dao* hall,
shall free the departed from the netherworld,
erase their black karmic deeds,
and remove their names from the ledgers of sin—
their spirit reborn in a land of purity and bliss.
All who suffer in the same hells shall be liberated,
relying on the *Scripture*’s compassionate salvation.
All shall ascend to Heaven above through this supreme blessing.

*"Command over"* (*命过*)—though Heaven’s blessings may be finite,
a single recitation of this true *Scripture*,
or the establishment of a *Dao* hall,
shall erase the departed’s sins and those of all suffering spirits in the hells,
granting them birth in Heaven.
If practiced eternally, what limit shall its merits have?

Alas! The hells have no gates—only one invites themself.
The Celestial Realm has paths—yet the ignorant struggle to walk them.
How much more so for those born with innate purity,
the *Scripture of the Imperial True One*—
if they perpetually uphold and recite it,
the hells and heavens shall never stain them,
eternally attaining the Mysterious True.

Thus it is said of those who well uphold this *Scripture*.

**Chapter 29 of *The Merits and Virtues* (continued):**
Wherever this *Scripture* resides,
the *Ten Heavenly Supreme True Saints* and the *Limitless Flying Heavenly Kings*
shall attend in reverence, offering protection.
Those who uphold this *Scripture* may rightly call themselves *Zhengyi True Persons*.
Wherever such a person dwells,
the *Ten Directions’ Supreme True Saints* and *Golden-Armed Vajra Warriors*
shall secretly guard them as their own body.
Whether in travel or repose,
all malevolent forces shall flee their path,
demons shall be exterminated,
spirits shall hide in submission,
and no calamity shall dare approach them.

When such a person’s life nears its end,
they shall not see the horrors of the hells—
instead, they shall behold Heavenly Maidens of Jade bearing flags to welcome them,
and ascend to Heaven above.

If their Heavenly blessings are exhausted and they return to the mortal realm,
they shall, across countless lifetimes,
always be reborn as kings, ministers,
sage rulers, and virtuous officials,
gathering in assemblies of the enlightened—
their lands peaceful, their people at ease in righteousness,
their innate nature ever luminous.
By following the Great *Dao*,
they shall progressively cultivate,
ultimately attaining the Dao’s shore.

Such are the blessings bestowed upon those who uphold this *Scripture*.
The *Scripture*’s merits do not merely benefit life and death—
wherever this *Scripture* resides,
the *Ten Heavenly Supreme True Saints* and the *Limitless Flying Heavenly Kings*
shall attend in reverence, offering protection.
Those who uphold this *Scripture* may rightly call themselves *Zhengyi True Persons*.
Wherever such a person dwells,
the *Ten Directions’ Supreme True Saints* and *Golden-Armed Vajra Warriors*
shall secretly guard them as their own body.
Whether in travel or repose,
all malevolent forces shall flee their path,
demons shall be exterminated,
spirits shall hide in submission,
and no calamity shall dare approach them.

When such a person’s life nears its end,
they shall not see the horrors of the hells—
instead, they shall behold Heavenly Officials and Jade Maidens bearing flags and banners to welcome them,
and ascend to Heaven above.

If their Heavenly blessings are exhausted and they return to the mortal realm,
they shall, across countless lifetimes,
always be reborn as kings, ministers,
sage rulers, and virtuous officials,
gathering in assemblies of the enlightened—
their lands peaceful, their people at ease in righteousness,
their innate nature ever luminous.
By following the Great *Dao*,
they shall progressively cultivate,
ultimately attaining the Dao’s shore.

Such is the fortune bestowed upon the *sutra*-holder.

The Ten Heavens, the Ten Directions, and all the Celestial Kings—
the Flying Celestial Kings, who are the Celestial Kings that traverse the skies in flight and guard the heavens.
They stand in attendance, bowing to shield them.

The *Zhengyi* True Person, one who is upright and unselfish, true and undivided.
The *Jin Gang* Powerful Ones, the guardians of both teachings—
all come to protect the *sutra*-holder.

In secret, they guard them,
protecting them unseen,
as though safeguarding their own luminous essence—
one can perceive the fervor of the gods’ protection.

Wherever such a person goes—
whether they emerge or retreat—
all malevolent demons, spirits, and *qi*-bound entities
flee, hide, or submit in fear.
They are utterly exterminated and removed.

*Exterminated*—meaning cut off, utterly spent.
Calamities and misfortunes cannot draw near.

When this person’s life draws to its end,
they shall not behold the myriad horrors of the hells.

The Heavenly Palace Maidens—
a variant reading mistakenly says *Heavenly Officials*—
are not the same.
The *zhang* (great banner of the *Dao*), not a *fan* (military flag) nor a *jing* (ceremonial standard),
is the banner of the Great *Dao*.
They descend to escort and guide them upward to Heaven.

Across countless lifetimes,
they shall be reborn as kings and ministers,
always held in honor,
like the Buddha’s eight thousand descendants as royal princes,
or the *Xuandi* Emperor ruling for a thousand lifetimes,
or a thousand lifetimes as a prime minister,
or the *Laojun* (Venerable Master) throughout the kalpas as the sovereign teacher of emperors and kings.

Together, they ensure enduring peace and joy,
while their innate luminous nature remains unobscured—
great wisdom and great insight,
never dimmed by the virtuous causes of past kalpas.

They uphold and revere the Great *Dao*,
repeatedly cultivating and refining,
progressively practicing and attaining,
until they reach the *Dao*’s shore.

The *Dao*’s shore—meaning attainment of the *Dao*,
as crossing to the opposite shore of the sea.
The Buddha spoke of "reaching the other shore."
The *Great Odes* say: *"They first ascend to the shore."*
This is what is meant.

One variant says: *the shore of return*.

The merit of reciting the *sutra* brings benefit at every moment—
whether aiding the living or the dead,
whether few or many,
whether near or distant,
all wishes fulfilled,
truly manifesting the power of transformation.

Or over countless lifetimes,
unwavering in devotion,
repeatedly cultivating and refining,
only then ascending to the *Dao*’s shore.

Thus, the attainment of great perfection is truly arduous.
Those who observe the *sutra* with resolute intent
may enter the highest echelon.

**Chapter 30: The Merits of the *Sutra***

If one recites this *sutra* when rain falls,
arousing great compassion,
and as prescribed, recites the three volumes of this *sutra* toward the void,
all beings touched by the rain,
in the direction of their faces,
whether committing the five heinous offenses, ten evils,
or any grave sins—
all are utterly eradicated.
All severe illnesses are spontaneously cured.

Upon their death,
these beings shall not fall into hell,
but be reborn in pure lands,
emerging from lotus flowers.
How much more so for those who recite this *sutra* themselves!

If one recites this *sutra* while traveling,
and a great wind arises, blowing against the reciter,
the dust touching their body—
wherever that dust settles,
all beings’ evil deeds are utterly destroyed,
and they shall not fall into the three evil paths,
instead being reborn in heaven.

Thus, the merit of reciting the *sutra* is unfathomable.
Its virtue extends beyond benefiting oneself alone.

If one recites this *sutra* when rain falls,
arousing great compassion to save the world,
and as prescribed, recites the upper, middle, and lower volumes of this *sutra* completely,
all beings touched by the rain,
in the direction of their faces—
whether committing the five heinous offenses, ten evils,
or any grave sins—
all are utterly dispersed and annihilated.
All severe illnesses are spontaneously cured and healed.

These beings in the direction of the reciter’s face,
upon death,
shall not fall into hell,
but be reborn in pure lands,
untainted by defilement,
emerging from lotus flowers.
How then can the merit of those who recite this *sutra* be measured?

If one recites this *sutra* while traveling,
and a great wind arises, blowing against the reciter,
the dust touching their body—
wherever that dust settles,
all beings’ evil deeds are utterly destroyed,
and they shall not fall into the three evil paths,
instead being reborn in heaven.

Thus, the merit of reciting the *sutra* is unfathomable.

**Explication of Doubts:**
The reciter’s compassion knows no bounds—
not only when rain falls or wind rises,
but with great compassion at all times.
This speaks to the efficacy of reciting the *sutra*.
Great compassion and pity extend to all beings in the world.

The *Release Teachings* say: *"A mother’s heart is too tender."*
The *Odes* say: *"Alas, this one alone is honored."*
It also says: *"Pity cannot perfect a person."*
The *Dao* scriptures say: *"Great compassion awakens the world."*
The reciter pities the suffering of worldly beings,
thus arousing great compassion.

The five heinous offenses:
disloyalty, unfilial piety, lack of kindness, discord, and injustice.
Or: disrespect for heaven, earth, sovereign, parents, and teachers;
disrespect for the Three Jewels;
failure to uphold precepts;
lack of moral cultivation;
and ignorance of true nature.

The ten evils:
killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, deceit,
slanderous speech, false speech, flattery,
harsh words, greed, anger, and delusion.

All severe illnesses are cured.
*Syuan* (痊): restored to ease.
*Yu* (愈): fully healed.

Lotus-born rebirth:
In the Buddhist tradition, the Western Pure Land’s beings emerge from lotus flowers.
In the *Dao* tradition, the *Qinghua Changle* realm’s beings are lotus-born.
It is also said: *"Desire arises from the lotus."*
Meaning that in both worldly and transcendent existence,
they remain unstained by dust,
with wondrous *dharma* perpetually arising,
free from defiled thoughts.
As at the dawn of heaven and earth,
naturally giving rise to humanity.

Confucian scholars often dismiss the two teachings as false.
Yet Yi Yin was born from a lotus—
was he not a sage of Confucian virtue?

Moreover, the human heart

The virtuous *power* of those who uphold the *Sutra* extends not only to humanity.
If the *Sutra* traverses rivers, lakes, the Huai, and the seas,
and washes over their bodies,
then all beings in that water—
fish, tortoises, *qīnghua* (鼋), *tuó* (鼉), and every aquatic creature—
shall have their past karmic transgressions utterly extinguished,
and shall exhaust their present lifetime’s retribution.
After death, they attain the wondrous fruit of rebirth,
no longer receiving bodies of birth—
whether from egg, womb, moisture, or transformation—
in all forms.

Those who uphold the *Sutra*,
when speaking all words and sounds,
even the most perverse *demons* and *external paths*,
hearers mistake them not for mundane speech or breath,
but as the pure and sacred tones of *dharma*.

Should they encounter divine shrines,
they can recite this *Sutra* to the deities,
and when the spirits and gods hear this *Sutra*,
they break free from the *karmic realm of ghosts*,
ascend to the *Way of the Immortal*,
and revere such upholders
as they would the sovereign Emperor himself.

**The *Sutra* traverses:**
The *Sutra* is the passage through;
*traverse* means to cross.
Some say: "To cross water bare-bodied is called *traverse*—*
like the Master Lü’s chanting flight over Dongting Lake,
or Bodhidharma’s lotus-stalk crossing of the river.
In essence, all crossing of water—
whether bare-bodied, by boat, or otherwise—
is called *Sutra traverse*.
Rivers, lakes, and seas are all general names for flowing water.
The Huai is the Huai River.
*To wash and bathe their bodies* means to cleanse with water.
*All beings within water* refers to every living thing in it—
scaled like fish, shelled like tortoises, *qīnghua* (鼋), *tuó* (鼉), and all aquatic life.
Their karmic transgressions are all extinguished,
and they exhaust their retribution in this very lifetime.
After death, they no longer cycle through animal rebirths—
whether feathered, furred, scaled, shelled, or insect-like—
nor receive bodies from egg, womb, moisture, or transformation.
Though humans are born from the womb,
the term *womb* here does not refer to humans alone,
but to all latent forms.

For dragons are the sovereign among aquatic beings,
yet they still speak of karmic retribution;
how much more so for the lower aquatic creatures!

True upholders of the *Sutra* emit golden radiance from their bodies and mouths,
so wherever their voice reaches,
all perverse *demons* and *external paths* who hear it
believe it to be the pure and sacred tones of *dharma*.

To recite the *Sutra* for the deities
is to liberate them from their ghostly *karmic realms*.
Though deities are subtle and radiant,
displaying their might and manifesting retribution,
they still possess *karmic inclinations*.
Hearing this true *Sutra*,
they sever their *cognitive roots*,
uproot their *karmic tendencies*,
and dissolve all past habits.

To ascend to the *Way of the Immortal*
is to attain the highest path of true transcendence.
The distinction between gods and immortals lies in their ranks.
Even great gods, though possessing virtue,
still retain visible deeds and traces,
like eminent sages who have not yet dissolved their forms,
or those who have entered sainthood but remain unequal.

Immortals, however, transcend the Five Aggregates,
purify the Nine Consciousnesses,
dispel subject and object,
and harmonize phenomena and principles.
Though divided into Five Grades,
they far surpass the gods and ghosts.

When the Sage arises,
all things flourish,
mountains do not overflow,
rivers do not run dry,
birds and beasts, fish and tortoises,
all thrive in accord.
The lawful waters of the *Sutra*’s upholders,
which touch the aquatic beings,
are no less than the transformative *power* of a sage-emperor.
Dragons, enlightened by the law,
equally touched by the *Sutra*’s waters—
who could fail to transcend?

This is how the *wild fox* attained the law
and regained its human form.

If one recites the *Sutra* to deliver gods and ghosts
from their *karmic realms*—
like the Master Sa’s deliverance of King Lingguan,
or the Venerable Puxian’s instruction of Guan the Great Sage—
they will revere the divine might,
forgetting all past afflictions.
Thus, even to this day,
the reverence for these two sages does not wane.

**Continuation of the Virtuous *Power* of the *Sutra* (Thirty-Second Chapter):**

If a person in this world
does not honor their parents,
does not revere the Three Treasures,
and commits grave offenses—
slaying life, theft, licentiousness, falsehood,
and all manner of most heinous crimes—
when their life is about to end,
if a virtuous *Dao*-hearted man or woman,
with pure faith and great compassion,
recites the august name of the Jade Emperor
seven times, or fourteen, twenty-one, twenty-eight,
up to a hundred or thousand repetitions
at the dying person’s head before their *qi* is severed,
all the unwholesome deeds they committed in life
are utterly extinguished,
and they will not fall into any evil *karmic realm*.
Their spirit ascends to the Nine Heavens—
how much more so for those who receive and uphold this *Sutra*?

Or if there be one
who, from past *kalpas* down to this very body,
has cycled through human and heavenly realms,
drifted in the world’s domains,
and accumulated countless faults and myriad offenses
within their own being—
should they encounter those who uphold this *Sutra*,
even if their shadow briefly touches the upholder’s body,
or if they are caught within the sovereign Emperor’s radiant light,
or share a word, or hear the voice,
as though receiving the Emperor’s lawful speech
to soothe and guide them,
their karmic obstacles are permanently erased.

The *Sutra*’s virtuous *power*
does not merely extend downward to beings,
but upward to gods and ghosts as well.

If a person in this world
does not revere the Three Treasures,
and commits grave offenses—
slaying life, theft, licentiousness, falsehood,
and all manner of most heinous crimes—
when their life is about to end,
if a virtuous *Dao*-hearted man or woman,
with pure faith and great compassion,
recites the august name of the Jade Emperor
once seven, twice three-four times seven,
up to hundreds or thousands of repetitions
at the dying person’s head before their *qi* is severed,
all the unwholesome deeds they committed in life
are utterly extinguished,
and they will not fall into any evil *karmic realm*.
Their spirit ascends to the Nine *Qi* Heavens—
how much more so for those who receive and uphold this *Sutra*?

Or if there be one
who, from past *kalpas* down to this very body,
has cycled through human and heavenly realms,
drifted in the world’s domains,
and accumulated myriad faults and countless offenses
within their own being—
should they encounter those who uphold this *Sutra*,
even if their shadow briefly touches the upholder’s body,
or if they are caught within the sovereign Emperor’s *Dao*-radiance,
or share a word, or hear the voice,
as though receiving the Emperor’s lawful speech
to soothe and guide them,
their karmic obstacles are permanently erased.

**The Three Treasures:**
The *Way*, the *Sutra*, and the Master.
The *Way* is the root of the Three Teachings,
the progenitor of all existence;
the *Sutra* is the ferry and sustenance for crossing the world.

The Master is the eye of humankind and the heavens—
to disrespect thus incurs one offense.

Slaying, stealing, licentious lust, and false speech—
great transgressions bring great guilt,
and even a fleeting thought carries sin.
Countless offenses—
not all can be enumerated in words.

**Right Faith** is the utmost sincerity,
untainted by ulterior motives.

Reciting **one, seven, twenty-three, forty-seven, or a thousand hundred times**—
or as it is said, *"completing the Dao’s celestial circuit of transformation"*—
this too is valid.

They do not fall into the evil realms,
for they bear good roots and harbor no wicked thoughts—
thus they do not descend into evil.

They cycle through human and heavenly realms,
or enjoy the blessings of mortal or celestial life.
Some say: *"Human blessings are the blessings of both human and heaven."*

They drift in the world’s domains,
subject to the impermanence of birth and death,
like floating reeds on water,
entangled in karmic bonds they cannot escape,
as though submerged in deep waters.

**Worldly domains**—the boundaries of the mortal realm.

**A fleeting shadow’s touch**—
the form and shadow of the *Sutra*-holder
briefly illuminate the sinful one’s body,
as though ensnared by the Emperor’s radiant light.
*"Receive"* or *"authored"*—
it is the Emperor’s light that bestows,
not the Emperor Himself.
When the light descends upon a person,
they stand in solemn reverence, unburdened by thought—
thus it is said to *"ensnare and receive."*
I receive the lawful benefits of that light.

**Shared speech or heard voice**—
the sinful one may converse with the *Sutra*-holder
or hear their voice.
*"Dao-speech"*—the profound utterances of the Great Dao.
Or as some say: *"The speech of the Dao Ancestor"*—
too restrictive a claim.

**Comfort and instruction**—
*"Comfort"* is the soothing of kind words;
*"instruction"* is teaching and command.

**Karmic obstacles erased**—
all past and present sins are released,
all past and present impediments removed.

The *Sutra’s* divine power
benefits both the living and the departed,
its blessings extend to all—
only those of **right faith** attain such merit.
Thus, **utter sincerity** must be the foundation.

**Benefiting the departed**—
if one’s blessings extend to others,
how then can the merit of those who uphold this *Sutra*
be measured?
Let the observer take heed.

**Continuation of the Merits Chapter (Thirty-Three)**
If one who upholds this *Sutra* crafts a long banner,
inscribing the Emperor’s sacred name upon it,
and hangs it upon a tall pole—
whether in the temple hall or within the household—
wherever the winds direct that banner,
all beings in that direction
shall partake in supreme blessings,
and all evil deeds shall be utterly eradicated.

If one who upholds this *Sutra* inscribes the Emperor’s sacred name
upon all resonant objects—
whether bells, chimes, gongs, drums,
or any Daoist ritual implements—
whether struck in ceremony, played in practice,
or set in motion by the wind,
when their sound emanates—
near or far—
all beings who hear it
shall have their karmic obstacles purified.

This further expounds the merits of upholding the *Sutra*.

**Long banner inscribed with the Emperor’s name, tall pole**—
as previously explained.

**Temple hall**—the halls before the temple’s main sanctuary.
**Temple**—a place of solemn contemplation,
where the numinous resides without ulterior intent,
thus called *"Temple"* (*guàn*).

**Household courtyard**—before one’s home.

**The direction indicated**—
the aspect toward which the wind-blown banner points.

**Supreme blessings**—as previously defined.

**Bells, chimes, gongs, drums, and *tá*—**
all are ritual instruments of metal.

**All Daoist implements and ritual objects**—
including those of gold, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, clay, leather, and wood,
and all resonant objects,
or any implements used in Daoist rites.

**Ritual grounds**—
when the sacred name is struck upon ritual instruments,
it is permissible.

**How can playful striking also bear merit?**
This *"play"* is not reckless revelry or frivolous jest—
it may be the practice of ritual music,
or the unintentional striking by the young or the ignorant,
or the casual ringing of resonant objects in leisure.
**Inscribed sacred name**—
not the Emperor’s personal name,
but the **Eternal Name**, unchanging across *kalpas*,
the abiding Great Name—
thus called *"sacred name."*

**Wind-struck sound**—
when the wind causes resonant objects to chime.

**Near and far, all beings who hear the sound**—
their karmic obstacles are utterly purified.
Without distinction of distance,
all who hear the sacred name’s resonance
shall have their sins dissolved and be cleansed.

**Investigation:**
Ancient music was crafted to harmonize the divine and human,
to unite heaven and earth.
How much more so when the sacred name—
the honored title of the Primordial—
is heard, inspiring awe?
When the lawful sound resounds,
its divine efficacy is boundless.

**Emperor Shun’s music** made even beasts dance in rhythm—
how much more so for humans?
Hearing martial instruments inspires awe,
hearing playful toys brings delight,
hearing the *qin* brings harmony—
how much more so the sacred sound?

All resonant playthings are irrelevant.
Ritual instruments and musical tools
are used to honor the numinous and unify the will of the assembly.
Moreover, since the sacred name is inscribed,
those who hear it in reverence shall have their sins erased.

For **karmic obstacles** are the retribution for evil deeds.
When the lawful sound is heard,
goodwill arises spontaneously—
thus all karmic obstacles are annihilated,
and purity is attained.

Even now, a single thunderclap
fills listeners with reverence and fear—
this suffices as proof.

**Clarifying Doubts:**
In this age, many hang banners
and inscribe the sacred name upon ritual instruments and resonant objects,
yet those who see or hear them
do not have their karmic obstacles removed—
why is this?

Those who inscribe lack **true, sincere faith** in upholding the *Sutra*,
and those who hear or see it treat it as mere custom,
their stubborn hearts unrepentant,
even to the point of contempt, frivolity, or blasphemy—
without genuine devotion,
how can sins be absolved?

Alas! The *Sutra’s* sacred name—
its merits are immeasurable.
The ancient sages first upheld the *Sutra* to transcend themselves—
without movement, they inspire reverence;
without speech, they command faith.
Then, with the sacred name, they bless others—
thus their own blessings endure eternally.

**Continuation of the Merits Chapter (Thirty-Four)**
If one who upholds this *Sutra* attains enlightenment on birth and death,
retreats into deep mountains and forests to cultivate the True Way,
and at times ascends to overlook the peaks,
wherever their gaze extends—
across mountains, forests, streams, and valleys,
all living beings—
visible and invisible,
conceived in womb, egg, moisture, or transformation,
creeping, flying, swimming, or dormant—
all classes of existence,
their sins and karmic bonds shall be eradicated,
their bodies and minds purified,
and upon death, they shall be reborn in heaven.

How much more so for those who uphold this *Sutra*?
Know that such a person is already the embodiment of the Dao藏’s virtue/power.

Here, it further expounds upon the efficacy of upholding the *Sutra*—
**Enlightenment on birth and death.**
Birth and death are profound matters, their essence most difficult to fathom.
Dependent upon the vital essence and blood of parents,
receiving the *li* and *qi* of Heaven and Earth,
life—this is how one comes to be, yet its origin is unfathomable.
When the essence is exhausted and the *qi* dissipates,
when the spirit departs and the form withers—
death—this is how one ceases to be, yet its end is unfathomable.
Not knowing life, not knowing death,
though one may grasp the changes of affairs,
observe the principles of things,
and speak with clarity while acting without delusion—
this is not yet enlightenment.

If one who upholds the *Sutra* abandons the sacred and forsakes wisdom,
eliminates the two obstructions,
severs all delusions,
fuses innate nature,
attains great awakening,
realizes the Three Primordials,
ascends to the highest state,
and penetrates the root of birth and death—
this is what the Buddhist school calls *perfect enlightenment*.

**Retreating into deep mountains and forests.**
The ancients said: *"The small hidden one resides in the mountains."*
Since one has attained enlightenment,
whether high mountain or level plain—
all are Dao-fields.
Why must cultivation necessarily be in mountains and forests?
The great hidden one resides in the marketplace—
this is also true in principle.
Famous peaks and scenic wonders,
where the land’s *ling* is potent and sages abound—
true cultivators,
though they have no inclination for mountains and forests,
find that secluded peaks and lush groves
are naturally formed as immortal realms.
Thus, the recluse enters them.

**Cultivating the True Way and learning the Dao.**
Human nature’s original purity is utterly true, without falsity.
The Way of nature is spontaneous, needing no study or inquiry.
Yet as desires grow daily,
one is seduced by external transformations,
and the true gradually becomes false,
the Way of nature obscured.
Those who attain enlightenment,
in mountain or forest glades,
silently refine their cultivation,
restoring the Heavenly True,
partaking in the Great Dao,
and transcending birth and death.
*The Dao De Jing* says: *"Cease learning, and you will have no worries."*
Yet here it says *"learning the Dao"*—why?
There, *"cease learning"* refers to abandoning the names, forms, and thoughts of learning.
Here, *"learning the Dao"* means learning the boundless, effortless Way.
The Buddhist school holds enlightenment as supreme.
Yet here, enlightenment is but the beginning—
only then does one enter the mountains to cultivate the True Way and learn the Dao.
Thus, the ranks of these two paths are clear.

At times, those who learn the Dao ascend heights, overlook waters,
travel through wondrous landscapes,
and from mountain peaks survey all four directions.
Wherever their gaze extends—
whether mountains, forests, streams, or valleys—
*valleys*, the hollows and deep chasms of mountains—
all living beings, both manifest and latent,
those already born and those yet unborn,
including those born unseen—
whether womb-born, egg-born,
or generated from moisture and filth,
or spontaneously arising from nothingness,
all creeping, flying, swimming, or dormant—
the myriad classes of created life,
their past and present sins and karmic bonds,
all are eradicated.
Their bodies and minds are purified,
free from all entanglements,
and at death, they are reborn in Heaven.

The merits of a True Cultivator’s gaze extending to all things are thus—
how much more so for those who uphold this *Sutra*?
Know that such a one’s virtue/power is boundless,
the very essence of the Dao’s profound藏,
incalculable,
a body of supreme virtue/power.

The cultivator’s heart is vast in compassion and love,
never without benevolence.
Though unseen by sight or hearing,
their gaze encompasses all things,
and in silent reverence, they extend their spirit to rescue all sentient beings,
delivering them from the world.
Thus, they save all beings.

As the Confucian classics say:
*"Achieving harmony, all things are nurtured."*
*"Establishing the Spirit Platform, they observe the encroaching mists,
discerning calamities and omens,
and through subtle means, complete and assist all things."*
What Heaven and Earth cannot reach,
they enable humanity and spirits to receive their natural fate,
returning to the source of transformation—
what sins or karmic bonds could remain?

Those who praise Confucius say:
*"In a single lifetime, one cannot exhaust his learning;
across generations, one cannot fully grasp his depth."*
The ineffable is called divine.
Now, praising those who cultivate the True Way and learn the Dao,
we say: *"the embodiment of the Dao藏’s virtue/power."*
This speaks to its boundless embrace,
its unfathomable depth—
praise that cannot be exhausted.
Those who study the *Sutra* will understand this meaning.

**Continuation of the Merits Chapter (Thirty-Five)**
At that time, the Celestial Sovereign addressed the Jade Emptiness Emperor:
*"Now I have spoken briefly, yet the mysteries remain unfathomed.
If I were to expound fully,
those with errant views, doubts, and disbelief
would never exhaust the *Sutra*’s merits across kalpas."*

At that time—
*(as previously explained)*
The Celestial Sovereign refers to the Primordial Sovereign of the Beginning.
*"To speak"* means to address the Jade Emptiness Emperor of the Supreme Brightness.
*(Alternatively, the Jade Purity Emperor of the Void.)*
*"Now I"* refers to the Primordial Sovereign speaking at this moment.
*"Briefly"* means to outline the essentials.
*"Unfathomed"* means the Dao’s supreme mysteries and highest merits remain unexhausted.

If one were to expound fully upon this *Sutra*,
its merits—merits of reciting and upholding the *Sutra*,
benefiting sentient beings and all things,
benefiting existence and non-existence,
benefiting the formed and the formless,
benefiting self and others,
benefiting heaven and earth—
are already vast indeed.

Yet even so, if one were to expound fully,
those with errant views and disbelief
would still remain unconvinced.

What is spoken of here encompasses:
all beings in one world, past and present,
the existence and destruction of heaven and earth,
as well as the three thousand great thousand worlds,
from kalpa to kalpa, countless kalpas,
one future age, all future ages,
from the beginning without beginning,
to the end without end,
whether knowing or unaware,
whether perceiving or not perceiving,
whether conceptualizable or inconceivable,
whether finite or infinite—
all merits, both within this *Sutra* and for those who uphold it,
if widely proclaimed and expounded in their profundity,
would still leave the common folk—
the vulgar and the ordinary—
with errant views, doubts, and disbelief.

*"Vulgar"* refers to the common people of the world;
*"flow"* refers to those of ordinary inclinations.

Like water flowing, it cannot extract the finest grains.
*"Evil views"* are partial and crooked, not upright and vast.
*"Doubt"* arises when wisdom does not prevail—ambiguous, undecided.
*"Delusion"* stirs from private thoughts, tangled and confused, unable to discern right from wrong, a chaotic jumble of misguided perception—thus they disbelieve this *Sutra* holds boundless benefits.

The *Sutra*’s virtues exhaust even kalpas in speech,
countless kalpas beyond reckoning—still, they cannot be fully spoken.
Some say: "Exhausting the kalpas in recounting leaves speech still incomplete."
Fundamentally, the Primordial Origin endures eternally,
kalpas are endless, the *Sutra*’s virtues unfathomable,
the Great Dao immeasurable—
yet speech can never exhaust it.

The Great Dao is beyond words,
the Marvelous Law beyond form,
the True Scripture beyond letters—
what can be applied and received,
seen and heard,
spoken and attained,
are all but second meanings.

Thus, the Most High Sage manifested across countless kalpas,
preached to twelve thousand heavens,
traveled distant realms,
composed countless *Sutras*,
one manifestation lasting seventeen hundred years,
expounding the *Sutra* over ninety thousand times—
yet still declared, *"I do not know its name,"*
and by force named it *Dao*.

Confucius, inheriting the past and opening the future,
enlightening the ages to come, said, *"I know nothing."*
The Śākyamuni Buddha spoke for forty-nine years,
expounding the *Sutra* in over three hundred assemblies,
composing the Three Baskets of *Sūtras*, *Vinaya*, and *Abhidharma*—
yet still said, *"I now speak briefly, unable to exhaust it."*

Yán Zǐ stood alone, his heart in quietude, said, *"Though I wish to follow, I cannot find the way."*

This *Sutra* is the root of all teachings—
its virtues, if spoken, cannot be exhausted,
the highest of virtues.
Spoken of, it cannot be fully grasped.
Spoken, people still cannot truly understand.

Thus, the Confucian *wuwei* governance,
the Daoist true and profound virtues,
the Buddhist offering of life and body—
the righteousness of the Western import—
are all beyond what can be transmitted in words.

Ah! The wonder of the Wheel-turning Sage—
heart and hand in perfect accord.

Zhuangzi, the master of the Three Teachings,
thus beyond the six directions—
preserved without discussion,
sank without debate—
not that he could not speak,
but words easily stir confusion—
better to remain silent.

Even the Master rarely spoke of fate,
for the Nature and Dao are beyond hearing.

The Buddha spoke of countless worldly scenes,
dividing them into matters and principles—
setting aside their boundless, unverifiable vastness,
even if grounded, what cannot be spoken remains much.
Those who follow his teachings assume the Buddha spoke what no one else could—
foolishly deeming it lofty—
yet he was born in a distant land,
among strange peoples and customs,
a rugged, remote place,
surrounded by many,
and the Buddha accommodated their views.
China did not know.

Foolishly claiming the Buddha’s vision was vast—
observe China alone: within a hundred *li*, customs differ.
Yan, Yue, Tai, and Qi—
mountains and rivers shift the winds—
those who do not traverse them cannot know.
How much more so the distant Western Regions?
Even with historical records, they are but hearsay and miscellany—
how can they be trusted without error?

Men love the strange and unusual,
without investigating truth—
if the Buddha truly knew all,
why did his scriptures not enter China in Tang texts,
translated three times before becoming coherent?
Since they did not know Tang speech,
what he spoke must have been of neighboring lands—
or perhaps, like Zhuangzi’s parables, some were allegorical.

People do not examine closely,
erroneously judging superiority—
how their love of the strange exceeds!

Alas, not speaking of all realms
prevents further confusion—
briefly speaking of virtues and transformations
to awaken the ignorant,
revealing true intent,
manifesting the correct Law—
this is why the Dao brings real benefit.

Scholars should diligently investigate further.

*(End of the "Virtues" Chapter, continuing the thirty-sixth section.)*

At that time, the Jade Emptiness Celestial Sovereign, upon hearing this, felt boundless joy, unable to contain his exultation. Gazing upon the benevolent countenance, he bowed in reverence and exclaimed in praise, composing this hymn:

*"Above the Nine Heavens lies the Great Luo,*
*Jade Capital of golden gates, its cloud-layers towering.*
*Within dwells the Heavenly Emperor,*
*Renowned for mercy and harmony,*
*His Dao unmatched, subduing all demons.*

*His celestial treasures and sacred talismans,*
*Jade laws and golden decrees,*
*Myriad gods and immortals in attendance,*
*With banners and flags in countless array.*
*Those who hear his name see sins erased,*
*Forever freed from the River of Love."*

Thus is he called the Jade Sovereign—
*The True Elder of the Azure Vault,*
*Perfect and pure in wondrous roundness,*
*Endowed with wisdom and eloquence,*
*Supreme in Dao and majesty,*
*Teacher of the Three Realms,*
*Primordial Ancestor of the Chaos,*
*Unsurpassed Master of all,*
*Compassionate Father to the Fourfold Birth,*
*The Highest Saint of the Celestial Heights,*
*Great in Mercy and Benevolence.*

Ten names complete his glory,
A thousand virtues manifest in his essence,
Boundless in his salvation of beings,
Liberating all from suffering’s cycle.

When the Jade Emptiness Celestial Sovereign had finished reciting this hymn and the ten names,
All the celestial saints spoke as one in astonishment,
*"Never before heard!"*—
For this sacred law and its exalted titles
Are rare even across eons.

At the moment the Heavenly Lord concluded this chapter on the divine incantations and virtues,
The Jade Emptiness Celestial Sovereign, upon hearing these words,
Felt overwhelming joy and delight,
Unable to restrain his rapture.
Gazing upon the Jade Emperor’s benevolent visage,
He bowed in reverence and composed this hymn of praise:

*"Above the Nine Heavens lies the Great Luo,*
*The Jade Capital’s golden gates,*
*Its cloud-layers rising in majestic tiers—*
*Lofty peaks beyond measure.*

*The Great Luo’s golden gates,*
*Where auspicious clouds and radiant light enfold,*
*Layer upon layer, boundless in height,*
*Towering and sublime, vast beyond reckoning.*

*The Heavenly Emperor within,*
*The Jade Emperor, sovereign of ten thousand teachings,*
*His mercy boundless, his benevolence profound,*
*His kindness not for selfish gain,*
*But nurturing all beings across endless kalpas,*
*Ensuring their sufficiency—*
*Thus called ‘incalculable grace.’*

*His Dao’s might and virtue unrivaled,*
*Subduing all demonic forces.*

*His celestial treasures—*
*Sacred talismans of the heavens,*
*Not mere curiosities,*
*But divine seals of the Mysterious and True.*

*His jade laws and golden statutes,*
*The celestial precepts and golden decrees.*

*Myriad gods and immortals in attendance,*
*Serving the august presence,*
*Numberless as the sands of time,*
*Flanked by banners and flags in endless array.*

*Those who hear his sacred name and law*
*See their sins utterly extinguished,*
*Forever freed from the River of Love—*
*For all karmic bonds are severed.*

*Thus is he called the Jade Sovereign—*
*As previously explained.*

*The True Elder of the Azure Vault,*
*The boundless expanse of heaven,*
*Vast and measureless,*
*The Primordial One without beginning.*

*Perfect and pure in wondrous roundness,*
*Mystically complete and utterly clean.*

*Endowed with wisdom and eloquence,*
*Great in insight and wisdom,*
*Possessing marvelous oratory and boundless talent.*

*Supreme in Dao and majesty,*
*His Dao without end,*
*His eminence unmatched.*

*Teacher of the Three Realms,*
*The sovereign guide of heaven, earth, and humanity.*

*The Primordial Ancestor,*
*Before heaven and earth divided,*
*Before worlds arose,*
*The Imperial True One eternally present,*
*The true root across all kalpas.*

*Thus called the Ancestor of the Chaos.*

*Unsurpassed Master of all,*
*For all teachings and sages,*
*None can rival his stature—*
*All acknowledge him as sovereign.*

*Compassionate Father to the Fourfold Birth,*
*The Fourfold Birth—womb-born, egg-born, moist-born, and metamorphic—*
*All owe their existence to his virtue,*
*From birth to completion,*
*Guided by his Dao to their end,*
*Thus called the Compassionate Father.*

*The Highest Saint of the Celestial Heights,*
*For no heaven surpasses the Great Luo,*
*No immortal or Buddha his equal in rank—*
*Thus called the Highest Saint.*

*Great in Mercy and Benevolence,*
*His mercy and benevolence without measure.*

*Ten names complete his glory,*
*From the True Elder of the Azure Vault to the Benevolent One,*
*His ten names are fully realized.*

*The Heavenly Emperor’s virtues and divine powers*
*Are all perfectly complete as such.*

*A thousand virtues manifest in his essence,*
*Though spoken briefly,*
*His virtues are boundless.*

*Boundless in his salvation of beings,*
*Liberating all from suffering’s cycle.*

When the Jade Emptiness Celestial Sovereign had finished reciting this hymn and the ten names,
All the celestial saints, in unison, exclaimed,
*"Never before encountered!"*—
*For this wondrous law and its sacred titles*
*Are rarely met even in ages past.*

*Or as some say,*
*"Never before seen in this world!"*

*If such are the Emperor’s virtues,*
*Those who study this scripture shall attain true enlightenment,*
*And thus shall not be ashamed.*

At that time, the Celestial Sovereign of the Boundless Sky, upon hearing the scripture’s teachings, rose from his seat and knelt long before the Emperor, humbly declaring:
*"I pray that Your Sacred Benevolence universally benefit all assemblies, all celestial beings, and all who uphold and proclaim this scripture for their welfare."*

Then, the Jade Sovereign Emperor, moved by compassionate intent, opened the gate of benefit and proclaimed the *Yùkuì* [玉匮] ordinances, transmitting the *Língbǎo* [灵宝] sacred law, and addressed the Celestial Sovereign of the Boundless Sky:
*"Now, listen with utmost attention—I shall expound upon the virtues of receiving and upholding this scripture: its power to rescue the perilous, alleviate suffering, benefit the living and the dead, and perform divine and wondrous deeds."*

The assembled Celestial Worthies bowed in reverence and spoke in unison:
*"Today, we are fortunate to hear the *Zhànrán Chángzhù* [湛然常住]—the ever-abiding law. It bestows blessings upon all celestial realms, permeates the Three Realms, and annihilates the Three Woes and Five Sufferings. We humbly beseech Your Compassion to expound this sublime doctrine."*

After the celestial saints had extolled the virtues of the divine incantations and the Emperor’s sacred titles, the Celestial Sovereign of the Boundless Sky—who, though previously addressed as *Hàotiān* [昊天], is now properly named the *Hàdà Gāoxuán Tiāndì* [昊大高玄天帝]—heard the Celestial Worthy’s exposition of the scripture. Rising from his own seat, he knelt long before the Jade Emperor and respectfully declared:
*"I pray that Your Most Exalted Benevolence universally extend mercy to all assemblies—whether the celestial saints who hear this scripture, or the worldly multitude, though the heavens contain no worldly folk, for this scripture spans the Three Realms across boundless kalpas. It benefits all celestial beings and mortals, and all who uphold and proclaim its teachings, granting them boundless welfare."*

At that moment, the Jade Sovereign Emperor, moved by compassionate intent, awakened the boundless wisdom of deliverance, opened the gate of eternal benefit, and proclaimed the *Yùkuì* [玉匮] sacred ordinances—this scripture being the *Yùbì Lánghán* [玉笈琅函], treasured in the heavens, hence the phrase *"proclaim the Yùkuì ordinances."* He then transmitted the *Xuánlíng Miǎobǎo Dàfǎ* [玄灵妙宝大法], the profound and sacred law, and said to the Celestial Sovereign of the Boundless Sky:
*"Now, listen with utmost discernment—I shall speak to you of the virtues of receiving and upholding this scripture: its power to rectify all perilous straits, rescue all from suffering, and benefit all living and departed through divine and wondrous means."*

The assembled Celestial Worthies bowed in reverence and spoke in unison:
*"Today, we are fortunate to hear the *Zhànrán Chángzhù* [湛然常住] law—the ever-abiding, untainted, unspoiled, unchanging, neither ascending nor descending essence of human nature. Though entangled by external afflictions, we ourselves bring ruin, drifting through the wheel of existence in blind ignorance, unable to abide in this ever-present truth. Even spirits with attachments and gods with sentience, though their karmic retributions end and they return to the cycle, still cannot abide in this ever-present truth. Now, hearing the scripture’s virtues and benefits, our innate nature is purified, the roots and dust of defilement are exhausted, karmic deeds and perceptions are extirpated, sins and obstructions are removed, and perfection is firmly established. This is the hearing of the ever-abiding law—a rare encounter in the ages, how could we not be fortunate? Its power extends blessings to all celestial realms and beings, permeating the Three Realms, as previously explained."*

The Three Abysses—Heaven’s Abyss, Earth’s Abyss, Water’s Abyss—
The Five Sufferings: the suffering of form bound by color, the suffering of spirit bound by desire, the suffering of body bound by greed, the suffering of soul bound by physical burdens, the suffering of essence bound by the realm of adornment.
All are thus extinguished.
Only by the Most Venerable’s boundless compassion and pity for my subjects—
*Pity* being compassionate mercy and tender concern—
does this wondrous meaning unfold.

For this scripture is the supreme and wondrous Dao, hence its such virtues.
Though the Celestial Sovereign of the Azure Sky does not seek its profound intent, yet he requests its blessings—not to flatter like one offering drink to a man.
Even a single word or stroke of this scripture is an immeasurable treasure.
Knowing its efficacy and holding it with true sincerity, one will not fail the compassion of its proclamation.

**Chapter One: The Chapter of Protection**

The Jade Emperor declared:
*"If any being reveres and nurtures their parents, honors the Three Treasures with respect, exhausts loyalty to their ruler, commits no killing nor theft, indulges in no lust nor jealousy, harbors no wrath nor resentment, no arrogance nor deceit, upholds precepts and observes pure fasting, merges their heart with the Great Dao, nurtures a reverent mind toward life, and recites this scripture, I shall command the law to permeate all realms, spreading across the ten directions of the boundless world. I shall order the Eastern East-Hua Emperor with his green cavalry, divine soldiers, and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Southeastern Fu-Sang Grand Emperor with his divine soldiers and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Southern Zhu-Ling Grand Emperor with his red cavalry, divine soldiers, and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Southwestern Tai-Hua Elder with his divine soldiers and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Western Hao-Ling Sovereign Elder with his white cavalry, divine soldiers, and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Northwestern Celestial Sovereign with his divine soldiers and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Northern Zi-Wei Emperor with his black cavalry, divine soldiers, and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Northeastern Chong-Xu Heavenly Lord with his divine soldiers and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Supreme Heavenly Emperor of the Upper Realm, the Kunlun Elder with his yellow cavalry, divine soldiers, and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture; I shall order the Lower Realm Lai-He Heavenly Lord, the mountain-grove deities, divine soldiers, and countless hosts to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture."*

The Jade Emperor declared:
*"Upholding the scripture is not merely reciting it aloud. If any being in the world reveres and nurtures their parents, honors the Daoist scriptures and the Three Treasures with respect, exhausts their strength and heart in loyalty to their ruler, refrains from killing, stealing, lust, jealousy, wrath, resentment, arrogance, or deceit, receives and upholds the pure and mysterious precepts of the Dao, observes true fasting with sincerity, neither neglectful nor hasty, tranquil and unhurried, surrendering to nature, nurturing stillness, aligning with Heaven and congealing the True—merging their heart with the Great Dao, revering it as the Azure Sky—if they hold this scripture with solemn devotion, I, the Jade Emperor, shall command the law to permeate all worlds, spreading across the ten directions of the boundless realm. I shall order the Eastern East-Hua Emperor with his green cavalry, the Southern Zhu-Ling Grand Emperor with his red cavalry, the Western Hao-Ling Sovereign Elder with his white cavalry, the Northern Zi-Wei Emperor with his black cavalry, the Southeastern Fu-Sang Grand Emperor, the Southwestern Tai-Hua Elder, the Northwestern Celestial Sovereign—these are the four cardinal directions—the Northeastern Chong-Xu Heavenly Lord, the Supreme Heavenly Emperor of the Upper Realm—this is not the Gou-Chen Celestial Sovereign, but the deity who governs Heaven. The Buddha called this the realm of the *Devadatta* (帝释天主). The Kunlun Elder with his yellow cavalry, the Lower Realm Lai-He Heavenly Lord, the mountain-grove deities, and their divine soldiers and countless hosts shall all descend to shield and protect those who uphold this scripture."*

*Shield and protect* means to cherish and uphold.
Those who uphold the scripture, revering the Emperor’s words of the Dao, harmonizing with virtue, aligning with Heaven and the Dao in truth—these are the bodies of the Great Dao.
Where the Dao resides, both gods and mortals hold it in reverence, hence the Emperor commands the ten-directional holy hosts to shield and protect.

Yet this is only for those who are loyal, filial, respectful, and abstain from lust, killing, theft, and falsehood.
Upholding the scripture must be rooted in virtuous conduct, merging the heart with the Dao—then the Dao itself will return to them.

Some say, *"The Dao withdraws from the world, avoiding rulers and kin, thus not practicing filial piety or loyalty."*
They do not know the Dao’s profound precepts are most strict—guarding, preserving, and refining, never daring to violate precepts or bring shame to their bodies or kin.
With utmost sincerity and firmness, they first repay the Four Graces—how could they ever forget their rulers and kin, or be unfilial or disloyal?
Thus, the True Lord composed *The Scripture of Pure Clarity on Filial Piety and Loyalty*, to reveal the Dao’s true filial piety and loyalty.

**Chapter Two: The Chapter of Protection**

I command all the Golden Immortals of the ten directions, the Four Assemblies and Eight Divisions, and their attendants, to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture.
I command the Heavenly True Saints of the ten directions, the Flying Heavenly Kings, the Three Officials and Four Saints, the Two Luminaries and Nine Stars, the Northern Dipper and Southern Dipper, the Eastern Dipper and Western Dipper, the Central Dipper, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Celestial Hosts, the Vajra Warriors, and the Divine Kings—each with their hosts—to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture.

**Chapter Three: The Chapter of Protection**

I command the ten-directional celestial hosts, the Four Assemblies and Eight Divisions, and their attendants, to descend and shield all who uphold this scripture.

I command the ten-directional worlds of all Golden Immortals. The Golden Immortals are the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The Four Assemblies are not the Four Assemblies of the secular world, but the Four Assemblies of the yin and yang deities and their celestial troops. The Eight Divisions are explained in the second volume. The attendants are the kinsmen and affiliated beings of the Four Assemblies and Eight Divisions.

The Heavenly True Saints of the ten directions are the True Saints of all the celestial beings in the ten directions. The Flying Heavenly Kings are explained previously. The Three Officials are Heaven, Earth, and Water. The Four Saints are Tianpang, Tianyou, Yisheng, and Yousheng. The Two Luminaries are the Sun and Moon. The Nine Stars are: Jin (金), Mu (木), Shui (水), Huo (火), Tu (土), Yue Mo (月孛), Zi Zhi (紫炁), Luo Hou (罗喉), and Ji Du (计都).

North, South, East, West, and Central are the Five Dippers. The Twenty-Eight Constellations are: Jiao (角), Keng (亢), Shi (氏), Fang (房), Xin (心), Wei (尾), Ji (箕), Dou (斗), Niu (牛), Nü (女), Xu (虚), Wei (危), Shi (室), Bi (壁), Kui (奎), Lou (娄), Wei (胃), Mao (昴), Bi (毕), Zhi (觜), Shen (参), Jing (井), Gui (鬼), Liu (柳), Xing (星), Zhang (张), Yi (翼), Zhen (轸)—all the stars of the celestial circuit.

The Vajra Warriors and Divine Kings are all the generals and troops. Each with their subordinates and attendant hosts.

The *Scripture* is the Emperor’s decree, proclaimed by the court command. The Three Ministers, Four Officials, the Two Capitals’ Nine Ministers, all officials and attendants, nobles of different surnames, and the myriad common folk—none dare fail to revere and uphold it.

The Jade Scripture is guarded and sustained by myriad deities, for the Emperor’s command honors the virtuous and aids those of power. Within the human body are the Three Primordials, Four Symbols, Two Qi, Nine Orifices, Five Phases, and the degrees of the Twenty-Eight Constellations—encompassing the celestial circuits. Water, Fire, True Will, Great Wisdom, Cultivation, Vigorous Practice, Marvelous Dharma, and Meritorious Deeds align with the deities, so that within a single body—its hair and skin, flesh and blood, sinews and bones, spirit and qi, essence and meridians—all support the True Nature’s authentic qi, preserving the vital treasure.

This True Nature’s authentic qi is the Emperor’s True Scripture: thirty-six thousand divine qi and eighty-four thousand fine-pored true lights, manifesting the Ten Directions’ Immortals, Vajra Warriors, and Stellar Divine Kings and their hosts. The *Sutra of Disaster Dissipation* states: *"There are the Heavenly True Saints and Vajra Warriors, each numbering hundreds of billions, guarding this Scripture"*—this is its meaning.

The Scripture is not confined to words and letters; its true intent lies within our heart. The deities are not bound to the Ten Directions’ worlds; they reside within our single body.

「Cultivate the mind and refine the body—this is not achieved through mere chanting and reading, but through sincere, silent practice, with utmost sincerity and selflessness. When spirit and *qi* are complete, the Sage can be emulated, Heaven can be aspired to, the Dao/Way can be entered, and all actions will bring auspicious results; the deities will surely protect you.

When the three medicines are depleted and the True Nature is lost, one’s own spirit weakens, *qi* falters, and essence fails to circulate fully—this defies Heaven’s order. How then could the deities protect you?

Alas, all humans share the same essence, but the virtuous who cultivate it thrive in auspiciousness, while the petty who defy it meet disaster. Thus the Scripture says: *"Those who cover and protect this Scripture will know the blessings of Heaven through virtue."*

The Emperor’s virtue is boundless, and the benefits of this Scripture are supreme—how greatly do people respect and receive it?

The *Chapter of Protection* decrees: The Vajra Warriors who command life and death, the Four Heavenly Kings of the gates, the Five Sacred Mountains and Four Great Waters, as well as all named mountains, the Four Seas and Nine Rivers, the Twelve River Sources, forests, valleys, streams, and marshes—all their ruling deities and their retinues—shall cover and protect those who receive and uphold this Scripture. In all perilous and treacherous places, they shall grant safety and stability.

The Emperor’s decree extends to all local deities of the lands, including those of ditches and canals, as well as all great-power ghostly kings, commanding them to cover and protect those who receive and uphold this Scripture.

The Twelve River Sources are now recorded as thirteen names, for two waters share the same source—thus it is called the Twelve River Sources. The decree commands the Subduing Kings and Heavenly Vajra Warriors. The Four Heavenly Kings of the gates are the Eastern, Western, Southern, and Northern gatekeepers. The Five Sacred Mountains are: the Eastern **Tài**, Southern **Héng**, Western **Huá**, Northern **Héng**, and Central **Sōng**. The Four Great Waters refer to the deities of the **Jiāng**, **Hé**, **Huái**, and **Jì** rivers.

All named mountains in the world are included. The Four Seas are the Eastern, Western, Southern, and Northern seas. The Nine Rivers include: **Yángzǐ**, **Qiantáng**, **Hànyáng**, **Huìyáng**, **Hùntóng**, **Jǐn Jiāng**, **Xiāng Jiāng**, **Wūlóng**, and **Yālù**, encompassing all rivers.

The Twelve River Sources are the origins of the Yellow River, the world’s vital vein: such as **Kūnlún**, **Yǔmén**, **Xīngxiù Hǎi**, **Huǒdūn Nǎo’ér**, and its tailing streams, **Fāxiè** and **Fáxiè**, along with the roots of other rivers that flow into it. Another account states that when discussing the Yellow River’s sources, **Kūnlún** has nine wells and seven springs, not just twelve. The Twelve River Sources pertain to the nine rivers—**Túhài**, **Tàishǐ**, **Mǎxiá**, **Fùfǔ**, **Húsū**, **Jiǎnjié**, **Gōu pán**, **Gēlín**, **Rǔ**, **Hàn**, **Huái**, and **Sì**—as well as the **Rǔ**, **Hàn**, **Huái**, and **Sì** waters, totaling twelve.

The Yellow River is the supreme deity of all rivers. Rivers like **Jīng**, **Wèi**, **Yí**, **Wèn**, **Shēn**, **Wéi**, **Hùtuó**, **Xīngxié**, and **Ruòshuǐ**, along with all other rivers, are its subordinate deities. The forests and mountains encompass all terrestrial groves and peaks. The streams and marshes are all the world’s flowing waters and wetlands. *川* refers to moving waters; *泽* means stagnant waters. All ruling deities of mountains, forests, streams, and marshes, along with their retinues, are commanded to cover and protect those who uphold this Scripture.

In all hazardous and difficult places, let them have no worries and find stability—this refers specifically to those who hold the Scripture. Wherever the Emperor’s decree reaches, all local deities and responsive spirits of the lands shall heed it. *沟* (gōu) are dry channels, either in mountains or earth; *渠* (qú) are waterways. *等神* (děngshén) includes all minor deities beyond ditches and canals.

All great-power ghostly kings are likewise commanded to cover and protect those who uphold this Scripture.

The essence of this Imperial Scripture aligns with the treasures of all Immortals, the teachings of all Buddhas, the practices of all Heavens, the reverence of all deities, and the recitations of all people. Demons and malevolent spirits submit themselves. Indeed, mountains are steadied by it, and waters flow endlessly—its protection is strict and unyielding.

If those who uphold the Scripture are its very guardians, how then could they dare to be negligent? A single moment of carelessness brings grave sin and deep consequences.

Truly, Confucius said: *"The petty do not know Heaven’s decree and do not fear it."* They mock the great, scorn the words of the Sage—this is the petty. Even in observing this Scripture, one must still guard against arrogance and exert diligence.

The *Fifth Chapter of Protection* concludes.»

The **Scripture** commands all **demons (魔)** and **external heretics (外道)**—whether **Heavenly Demons (天魔)**, **Earthly Demons (地魔)**, **Demon Kings (魔王)**, **Demon Folk (魔民)**, or **Demon Women (魔女)**—to tremble and submit, vanish their forms and flee their traces, soar high beyond the seas, and retreat far to distant realms.

Thus, all **mountain spirits, forest deities, ancestral shrines, and temple guardians (山林社稷祠庙之属)**, as well as **every ghost and spirit (一切鬼神)**, shall **self-destruct and vanish (自消灭)**.

The **Five Directions’ Plague and Epidemic Demons (五方行病瘟疫鬼帅)**, **all malevolent ghosts and spirits (诸恶鬼神)**, including the **Wind King (风王)** and **water monsters (水怪)**, the **sinful retributive dragons (孽音业龙)** and **malevolent deities (妖神)**, **earthly spirits (土精)** and **water sirens (水魅)**, shall all **self-destruct and vanish (尽自消灭)**.

The **Five Empties (五虚)** and **Six Depletions (六耗)**, **unusual dreams (梦寐乖常)**, **sorcery along wild paths (野道咒咀)**, and **poisonous hexes (蛊毒之类)** shall likewise **self-destruct and vanish (皆自消灭)**.

For those who **uphold the Scripture with a devout heart (持经人心欲愿者)**, all **whims shall be fulfilled (一切如意)**, and **every desire shall be satisfied (皆得满足)**.

**Astonishing and resounding (慑音聂)!**

The **Scripture commands (令)**—by **imperial decree (勅命)**, **prohibition (禁令)**, and **extermination (剿除)**—all **demons (诸魔)** and **external heretics (外道)**:

**External heretics (外道)** are those who indulge in **lewd speech (淫辞)**, **perverse doctrines (邪说)**, **deviant practices (僻行)**, **miscellaneous techniques (杂法)**, **side-door sorcery (旁门)**, and **petty occult arts (小术)**, including **private methods (私技)** numbering **three thousand six hundred, ninety-six kinds, or thirty-six thousand (三千六百、九十六种、三万六千等)**.

The **Scripture commands (令)**—by **imperial decree (勅命)**, **prohibition (禁令)**, and **extermination (剿除)**—that they **all tremble and submit (悉皆慑伏)**.

All **demons (诸魔)**—**trepidation (慑)** is the **submission of the heart in awe (惊畏心服)**, **subjugation (伏)** is the **retraction and surrender (收敛归伏)**. They **conceal their forms and flee their traces (潜形遁迹)**—**concealment (潜)** means to **hide their likeness (藏其形象)**, daring not to reveal themselves; **flight (遁)** means to **evade their traces (逃其影迹)**, daring not to linger.

Though the forms of these **demons (诸魔)** may outwardly appear **bewitching (妖艳)** and their illusory shapes **strange and beautiful (幻象奇美)**, their true nature is **obstructed (阻)**, unseen by mortals. This **Scripture’s true teachings (真法)** shatter the **ghosts’ resolve (破鬼之胆)** and **shatter the demons’ hearts (碎魔之心)**. No demon can escape its scrutiny—**awe-struck by the profound and potent decrees (玄律丹劲)**, they dare not linger, lest their **ugly essence (丑质)** be exposed.

The **external heretics (外道)** seek to **obscure the truth (乱真)** with their words. When the **True Dao (正道)** prevails, **deviant doctrines (邪说)** fade; when the **Great Dao (大道)** is honored, **side-paths (傍门)** are abandoned. Once the **imperial decree (帝命)** is proclaimed, they dare not persist.

To **soar beyond the seas (高飞海外)**—their **demonic deeds (魔行)** leave no trace—**a metaphor for utter disappearance (飞言)**. How could **external heretics (外道)** be said to **fly (飞)**? To **restrain the heart and ease the mind (格心易虑)**, to **turn toward transformation and abandon selfishness (向化忘私)**, to **ascend beyond the seas (高腾海外)**—this is the **common phrase (俗语言)** for **the soul fleeing to the heavens (魂飞天外)** and **the spirit dispersing into the nine heavens (魄散九霄)**. They flee to distant lands, **daring not to remain in their former places (不敢居其故地)**.

Thus, all **mountain spirits, forest deities, land gods (社), grain gods (稷), temple spirits (祠), and ancestral shrines (庙)**—those that demand **blood sacrifices and offerings (血食)**—**every ghost and spirit (鬼神)** shall **self-destruct (自消灭)**.

**Mountains and forests (山林)**—as previously explained. **Land gods (社)** are **earth spirits (土神)**; **grain gods (稷)** are **harvest deities (谷神)**. **Temples (祠)** are **overseers (司)** and **sacrificial rites (祀)**—where deities **oversee and are invoked (神之司临)**. **Shrines (庙)** are **places of worship (朝)**, where **ancestral spirits are honored (妾神於庙)** and **sacrifices of blood, grain, and wine (血食享牲醴)** are offered.

All these **spirits (鬼神)** are **worthy of veneration (宜祀者)**—how then can they **self-destruct (自消灭)**? If **spirits are summoned without proper rites (神邀祭祀)**, they will **act unjustly (为不直)**; if **the people flatter ghosts and spirits (民谄鬼神)**, they will **act corruptly (为不正)**.

Thus, the **Master Sa Zhengren** subdued the **King of Spirits (王灵官)** and reformed the **City City God (禁城隍)**; **Ximen Bao**, governor of **Jizhou**, cast the **shaman into the water** to restrain the **River Spirit (河神)**. How much more so when **evil spirits feign divinity to deceive people**, and **people revere falsehoods to mislead the common folk**?

Therefore, **Hu Ying** in his governance of **Guangdong** destroyed **illusionary Buddhas** and slew **demonic serpents**, punishing monks to free the ignorant masses. Now it is said that **all ghosts and spirits shall self-destruct (消灭)**—following the **Scripture’s decree**, they **no longer bestow blessings or calamities**, and their **threat and influence vanish**.

The **Five Directions’ Plague and Epidemic Spirit Generals (五方行病瘟疫鬼帅)**—these **malevolent ghosts and spirits (诸恶鬼神)** are not the **Plague Spirit Generals (行病鬼帅)**, but rather **the world’s malevolent and powerful ghosts (世之厉鬼强神)**. Alongside them, the **Wind Sovereigns (并行风之王)**, **water monsters (水中之怪)**, **violent and sinful dragons (作孽暴龙)**, **portentous and malevolent spirits (妖异邪神)**, **earthly sprites and wood demons (土精木魅)**—all shall **self-destruct**.

The **Five Emptinesses and Six Depletions (五虚六耗)**—the **emptiness of spirit, qi, blood, and body (精神气血身五虚)**, the **withering of the six pulses (六脉衰耗)**—lead to **dreams contrary to nature (梦寐乖常)** and **restless soul and spirit (魂魄不宁)**.

It is also said that the **Five Emptinesses and Six Depletions (五虚六耗)** are like **heaven’s weeping and ruin (天哭破败)**, the **stars of calamity (丧门、太岁、大耗、小耗、飞康、空亡、黄旛、豹尾、九果、赤口、白舌)**—**malevolent omens, killing stars, and malevolent deities (恶厌神杀凶星、作祸神鬼之属)**—all **malevolent affairs (一切辱事)**, **wild Daoist rites (野道)**, **evil spells (邪法)**, **curses and incantations (咒诅妖语)**, whether **curses or oaths (或咒或誓)**, and **poisonous hexes and bewitchments (及蛊毒魇昧之类)**—all shall **self-destruct**.

For those who **hold this Scripture with sincere desire (持经人心欲愿者)**, all **schemes and aspirations (谋望)** that align with their hearts’ wishes (趁心如意) shall be **fulfilled without obstruction (皆得满足，无有违逆)**.

The **virtuous and moral (道德之士)**—ghosts and spirits **revere and hold them in awe (鬼神钦重)**—and all **malevolence and evil shall vanish (凶邪尽消)**.

When **Xiang Sang died**, **Zi Tong drove away the plague (梓橦驱瘟)**, **Jing Yang subdued the river dragon (旌阳伏蛟)**, **Master Zu’s ancestor subdued demons (祖天师伏魔)**, and **Master Sa restrained ghosts (萨祖禁鬼)**—all had **clear and manifest effects (皆有明效)**.

Ah! **Wang Yanzhang** was a **hero of integrity (烈士)**—though he **stole the wish for execution (盗愿刑戮)**, he **did not allow Yanzhang to know of external Dao (外道)**, truly a **man of virtue (诚有德之铃然者)**.

Yet, **human beings’ Three Corpses (三尸)**, **Five Burdens (五累)**, **Seven Emotions (七情)**, **Six Desires (六欲)**, and **Nine Consciousnesses (九识)**—**lower evil (下恶)** harms them, and **they deceive themselves (欺不能正己)**. If one **subdues evil and eliminates calamity (伏邪除凶)**, and **advances on the Dao (正进道)**, **severing the Three Corpses (斩三尸)**, **eliminating the Five Burdens (除五累)**, **extinguishing emotions and desires (情欲尽)**, and **removing malevolent consciousness (识恶除)**, then **one’s own wishes shall be fulfilled (己愿尽)**, and **external evils shall vanish while auspiciousness arrives (外邪消，凶散吉临)**.

**Protection and Upholding of the Six Chapters**
Even if one **cannot follow the prescribed rituals (未能遵依科教)**, **observe fasts (修崇斋醮)**, but only **maintains purity and upholds precepts (清净持戒)**, **devotedly accepts (专一信受)**, **honors and reveres (尊重敬慕)** this Scripture, and **participates in fasting rites (并同修斋)**, those who **uphold pure precepts (护持净戒)** shall have **unobstructed merit (功德坦然无碍)**, **freedom and ease (自在消遥)**, and are called **"Saints Among Men (人中圣)"**, with **enduring virtue and wisdom (德慧长新)**, equal to the **True Persons (诸真人)**.

Those who **receive and uphold the Scripture according to its law (如法受持经者)** shall have **merit beyond measure (功德莫量)**.

Even if one **cannot follow the esoteric rituals and precepts (未能遵依玄科教典)**, **observe grand fasts (修崇大斋醮)**, but only **remains pure and unstained (清净无染)**, **upholds precepts with singular devotion (持戒专一)**, and **adheres to the Daoist precept codes (持守道门戒律)**—whether the **Five Precepts, Eight Precepts, Twelve Provisional Precepts, Eighteen Precepts, Twenty-Four Precepts, Thirty-Six Precepts, Seventy-Two Precepts, One Hundred Twenty Precepts, One Hundred Eighty Precepts, Three Hundred Great Precepts, or the Six Hundred Pure Precepts of the Celestial Maidens (女冠六百净戒)**—if one **concentrates with wholehearted sincerity (专心致志)**, **devotes oneself to this precept chapter with unwavering resolve (持此戒品专一，坚固无二)**, **accepts and reveres it in faith (信受尊重)**, **accepts and practices it sincerely (信受奉行)**, **holds it in solemn awe (钦严尊重)**, and **reveres and admires this Scripture (诚敬仰慕是此经典)**, then even if one **only maintains purity, upholds precepts, and accepts them with singular devotion (或作但能清净持戒，专一信受，尊重敬慕读者)**, all are included.

They shall **participate in fasting rites together (并同修斋)**, and those who **uphold pure precepts (护持净戒者)** shall have **equal merit (功德一般)**. All **deities shall respect and protect them (诸神敬佑)**.

It is also said that **if one maintains purity and singular devotion (自己清净专一)**, **upholding the pure precepts they have taken (护持所守净戒)**, their **merit shall be unobstructed (是人功德，坦然无碍)**.

*"Tan"* means **level (平)**, *"kuang"* means **broad (广)**. If the **heart is divided (心有二)**, then **merit is not genuine (功德不实)**. If **precepts are not upheld (戒不持)**, they **taint merit (於功德有玷)**. When **mind and body are pure (心身清净)**, **precepts are upheld with singular devotion (持戒专)**, **acceptance is sincere (信受切)**, and **the Scripture is honored with reverence (尊敬经典)**, with **no attachment in the heart (心无染)**, **no division in the heart (心无二)**, and **no deficiency or obstruction (无有亏欠萦击)**, then **merit is truly genuine (功德真实)**, and **how can there be any obstruction (自是坦然，又有何碍)?** One shall **dwell in freedom and ease (自在逍遥)**.

---

From birth, human nature is **unbound and unrestrained (无拘无困)**. Yet when **encumbered by external influences (客感物累)**, one is **busy and labored (忙忙苦苦)**, losing **one’s innate harmony (无复自如)**, and **how can true joy (快乐) be found?**

When **the heart is pure and faith is true (清净正信)**, **external burdens are cast aside (无复物累)**, and **great freedom (大自在)** is attained, **joy becomes everlasting (常乐逍遥)**. Such a person is called **the Sage among mortals (人中圣)**, not merely one who **wanders freely (逍遥之人)**.

**Pure and true (消净正信)**, **transcending common humanity (高出人俦)**, this is the **Sage among mortals (人中圣人)**. **Virtue and wisdom are ever renewed (德慧常新)**, **practice aligns with insight (习与智长)**, and **transformation harmonizes with the heart (化与心成)**. When **perception and understanding are true (闻见真)**, **intellect merges with intuition (智虑融)**, and **external burdens are forgotten (物累忘)**, **true nature shines undimmed (性真湛)**.

**Virtue is daily renewed (德日新)**, **wisdom ever brightened (慧日明)**—this is the **ever-renewing virtue and wisdom (德慧常新)**. Those who **share in the true way (同诸真人)** are those who **hold scripture and attain the Dao (清净正信者同持经得道)****,** the **true beings of the heavens (诸天真人)**.

The **pure and true (清净)**—**upholding precepts (持戒)**, **singular in devotion (专一)**, **sincere in acceptance (信受切)**, **reverent in honoring scripture (尊重敬慕)**—**do so without calculation of merit (非有计功之心)**, nor **for human intent (为人之意)**. Their **actions are without ulterior motive (无所为而为)**, **utterly free from deceit or interruption (绝无虚假间断)**.

This is as the **Master Kong (孔子)** spoke: **"In haste or at leisure, no deviation (造次终食，颠沛无违)."**
This is as the *Zhōng Yōng* (《中庸》) states: **"None enter without finding their own fulfillment (无入而不自得)."**
Zhuangzi expounded the **essence of *Xiāoyáo* (逍遥)**, and **Bai Jianchuan (海蟾)** sang the **ode of *Kuàihuó* (快活)**.
The **Buddhist teaching of Great Freedom (大自在)**, the **Confucian principle of Daily Renewal (日新)**, and **"Revering the old and knowing the new (温故而知新)"**—all are **natural manifestations (自然之效)**.
**How could there be any contrivance or imitation (假借)?** **How could there be any forced adoption (勉强袭取)?**

Ah! **Pure and true (清净正信)**, even **without ritual instruction (不依科教)**, nor **observing fasts and offerings (修斋醮)**, **such natural merit (自然功德)** still exists. **Thus, the Dao’s profound essence (道旨玄科)** is **found only in the true substance of scripture (实体经义)**.
**Ritual instruction, fasts, and offerings (科教斋醮)**—the **Universal Law (普法)**—**are but means to propagate the Dao’s transformation (以演道化)**.
Chen Xiyi (陈希夷) **mocked the *Dù Rén Jīng* (度人经)**, yet **his attainment of the Dao (成道)** was **true adherence to scripture’s essence (盖真持经旨)**.

**Today’s fasts and offerings (斋醮)** lack **clear efficacy (无明效)** because **there are elaborate rites (有盛仪)**, yet **no true cultivation (无真修)**.
If **one is pure and true (清净正信)** and **further observes fasts and offerings (更修斋醮)**, then **merit is greatly enhanced (功益大)**.
Without **fasts and offerings (无斋醮)**, yet **with true sincerity (有真诚)**, merit **is still divine (功亦神)**.
If **sincerity is absent (无真诚)**, then **fasts and offerings (斋醮)** are **mere formalities (文具)**—**how much greater the fault (宁无过乎)!**

**Chapter on Protection (护持品七章)**
At that time, the **Celestial Sovereign, Emperor of Heaven (昊天上帝)**, upon hearing these words, **bowed in reverence (稽首)** before the **Celestial Sovereign (帝)** and sang:

**To the utmost degree of the Dao’s shore (至度道岸),**
**No calamity shall intrude (无使灾侵).**

**I bear the Sovereign’s mandate (我奉帝命),**
**All shall heed (一切咸听).**

At that time, the **Vision of Understanding (解见)** appeared as before. The **Celestial Sovereign, Emperor of Heaven (昊天上帝)**, upon hearing these words, **pointed to the merit of protection (指上护持功德言)** and **bowed in reverence (稽首)** before the **Jade Sovereign (玉帝)** while singing in praise:

**Great is the Supreme Dao (大哉至道)!**
**Its magnitude is beyond measure (大莫可量),**
**Its reach is beyond attainment (至不可及).**

**Formless and nameless (无形无名),**
**Unseen and unheard (不见不闻),**
**Its name is but a forced designation (名亦强称).**

**Vast through countless eons (渺渺亿劫),**
**Without beginning or end (无始无终),**
**Spanning innumerable ages (历劫无数),**
**A hundred million is called *yì* (亿), yet truly it is beyond number (要之举大数言，实无数耳).**

**The Yellow Way (黄道) opens in purity (开清),**

**Divine purity shines radiant (神清朗耀),**

**The Nine *Qi* display their radiance (九炁呈辉),**
**Exhaling essence in dazzling splendor (吐精炫瑞).**

**Some say the Jade Void (玉虚) manifests the Heavenly Radiance (天呈辉).**

**Heaven generates (天生), earth perfects (地成), and humanity is transformed (人教化),**
**These are the Three Primordial Forces (三元) nurturing the Dao (道养).**

**The Two Symbols (二象) encompass all life (摄生):**
**The *qián* (乾) and *kūn* (坤) create and transform (造化),**
**Generating all beings and things (生成人物).**
**Thus it is said, the Two Symbols encompass all life (终始宰制，故云二象摄生).**
**Some say the yin and yang mold and refine (陶铸) are the Two Symbols encompassing all life (二象摄生),**
**Both are correct teachings (俱是正论).**

**Chapter on Protection and Upholding**

At that time, the Celestial Sovereign of the Vaulting Heaven spoke these words and declared to the great assembly:
*"This is the Jade Emperor’s wondrous law, the secret speech of the Saints.
The path is severed, the Dao is cut off—
Subtle and unfathomable, its grandeur beyond measure,
The true essence of the divine, the root of all numinous power,
Guarding and pacifying the land, liberating beings from birth and death."*

When the Celestial Sovereign of the Vaulting Heaven had spoken these wondrous words—
*"The assembly of the law, the pure gathering of saints, all revered the Dao’s speech,
And universally attained enlightenment."*

At that time, the Celestial Sovereign of the Vaulting Heaven bowed in homage and praised the Jade Emperor.
After speaking these words, he declared to the celestial sages, true deities, and the great assembly:
*"This is the Jade Emperor’s wondrous law."*

All the Saints and Holy Ones possess their own laws—
Some vast yet measurable, transmitted with limits,
Some knowable in their beginning and end,
Some benefit the living yet neglect the dead,
Some aid humans yet abandon things,
Some are known to ghosts and spirits,
Some are not subdued by demons,
Some are formless and unknown, unable to universally save.
These are not wondrous.*

But this scripture’s transformative power is boundless,
Its efficacy immeasurable—
All who gain its benefit are of an extraordinary order.

Thus, the Jade Emperor’s wondrous law,
The secret, profound speech of the Saints and True Ones.
When the Primordial began to expound the scripture,
How could the Saints and the Most True Ones, upon hearing it,
Not treasure it and dare not lightly reveal it?
Hence, it is called the *Secret Speech of the Saints.*

The path is severed, the Dao is cut off—
The highest vehicle of all.
A law not commonly heard,
The essential path to True Cultivation,
The cyclical practice of the Saints.
Emotional desires and illusions are uprooted here,
Love and mundane thoughts are extinguished without remainder.
The wheel of rebirth is severed in two—
Thus, it is said: *The path is severed, the Dao is cut off.*

Another saying: *The Seven Saints were all deluded; this is a path few can tread.*
Subtle and unfathomable—
Deep and profound, beyond mortal thought,
Difficult for the mind to grasp,
A mystery even gods cannot fathom.
Its grandeur is vast—
A wondrous range of celestial chapters,
The true essence of divine enlightenment.

Another explanation: *The Jade Emperor’s Dao-range is the ultimate divine teacher.*
Too rigid a constraint.

Guarding and pacifying the land,
Liberating beings from birth and death.

At that time, the Celestial Sovereign of the Vaulting Heaven,
Having spoken this wondrous law—
*"The assembly of the law, the pure gathering of saints,*
*All revered the Dao’s speech—*
*Some take it as revering the Vaulting Heaven’s wondrous law,*
*And universally attained enlightenment."*

**Verification:**
*"The Master’s words on nature and the Dao cannot be heard by all."*
*The Scripture of the Beginning of Writing* says:
*"The wise create delusion; even ghosts and spirits do not recognize it."*
The Buddha spoke on Vulture’s Peak, and the bodhisattvas cupped their ears to listen.
The Jade Emperor’s law-speech—
*The path is severed, the Dao is cut off,*
*Subtle and unfathomable—*
What cause is there for doubt?
It is the root of all divine power,
Pacifying the land, liberating beings from birth and death—
This is its natural effect.

**Dispelling Doubts:**
There is no one outside the Dao, nor is there a Dao outside humanity.
All beings, bright or obscure, are the Dao itself.
Human nature is fully true;
All things are complete within it.
All transformations and nurturing,
The beginning and end of the world—
All are the true essence of my nature.

The Jade Emperor is the Dao-body;
The scripture is the Dao’s intent.
Only through the Dao is divine efficacy and transformation complete,
Mystery and nature inherently perfect.
Humans share the same essence—
How could they not uphold the scripture?

Know that the Dao resides within—
With a single mind, embodying the Dao,
Through all lifetimes without division,
Then the Saints and True Ones are already within me.

---

**Chapter Nine of Protection and Upholding**

Then, the Celestial Worthy spoke this gatha:

*The Jade Emperor’s merit is vast,*
*The Mystic Principle profoundly deep.*
*Born before the Great Calamity,*
*Transforming through ancient and modern times.*
*Now I expound this wondrous scripture,*
*Out of compassion for all sentient beings.*
*This is indeed the most wondrous law,*
*The merit of merits supreme.*
*The name is the highest vehicle,*
*Unmatched, the first of all.*

*The Radiant Sovereign of Great Light,*
*Whose virtue and power are rare in the world,*
*Can shatter violent evil demons,*
*And make all hearts submit in surrender.*
*Can extinguish the gravest crimes,*
*And grant all purity.*

*If one hears this scripture,*
*Or hears the Emperor’s wondrous name,*
*And bows in reverence,*
*All sins are annihilated.*

*The Ten Evils and Four Grave Offenses,*
*Even matricide and patricide—*
*With sincere faith, a single invocation,*
*All vanish with the sound.*

*Protecting humans and celestial beings,*
*The Four Calamities and Five Decays,*
*The Three Realms’ gravest sufferings,*
*Mundane human misfortunes,*
*Years of famine, pestilence, and death,*
*Poisons, nightmares, and malevolent spirits,*
*Lawsuits, wrongful accusations,*
*Warfare and battlefield torments,*
*Perils in mountains and forests,*
*Tigers, leopards, wolves, and their kind,*
*The venomous red seas and dragon-kind,*
*Swift lightning, wind, hail, and storms,*
*Fires, floods, thieves, and robbers,*
*Internal poisons and treacherous plots,*
*Madness and loss of reason,*
*Snakes, scorpions, and venomous insects,*
*Malevolent demons and monstrous spirits,*
*Those who lurk for human harm—*
*By holding this true scripture,*
*All such evils universally disperse and vanish.*

*Chronic illnesses, lingering and tormenting,*
*Even in dreams, no peace is found,*
*Unnatural desires that drain life—*
*These perish without blame.*

*Through encountering this scripture,*
*One attains security and freedom.*
*All desires and aspirations—*
*Wealth, treasures, and noble status—*
*Through this scripture’s merit,*
*All are fulfilled as one wishes.*

The Celestial Sovereign of Divine Might and Freedom,
The Eleven Luminaries of the Celestial Hosts,
The Thirty-two Heavenly Lords,
The Twenty-eight Constellations of Stars,
The Spirit Consorts and Jade Maidens and their kind,
Celestial Deities and Earthly Spirits,
The Gods of the Three Realms and Void,
The Dragon Kings of rivers and seas,
The Spirits of Water, Fire, and Wind,
Palaces and dwellings, mountains and forests,
Trees and all their kind,
The Spirits of ditches, canals, wells, and springs—
By holding this true scripture,
All shall protect and defend.

Clothing and food come naturally,
Children and descendants attain wealth and nobility.
Words spoken are rare and revered,
Wherever one goes, all honor and respect.

If one seeks sons or daughters,
By reciting this true scripture,
An imperial edict descends to the Celestial Bureau,
Registering them as Heavenly Immortals,
Descending to be born in their family,
To become their sons or daughters.

Nobles and the eminent hold them in high regard,
The Seven Ancestors ascend in rank.
The family’s glory shines brightly,
Extending blessings to parents and kin.
Constant auspiciousness thrives unceasingly,
Disasters and calamities cannot intrude.

Thus, I now proclaim—
The assembly must listen with earnest attention.
With boundless compassion, all are led to the Highest Purity.

The following verses were spoken by the Primordial Celestial Venerable:

*The Jade Emperor’s virtue is vast,*
*The Mysterious Principle profound and deep.*
*Born before the Great Calamity,*
*Manifesting through ancient and modern ages.*
*I, the Primordial, now speak this wondrous scripture,*
*Out of pity for all sentient beings,*
*The highest virtue among virtues,*
*The unparalleled wondrous law,*
*The foremost Mysterious Mechanism.*

*The Radiant Sovereign of Great Light,*
*Light infinite, the Awakened King Supreme.*
*Might and virtue rare in the world,*
*Mysterious Might and Marvelous Virtue—*
*The world cannot compare.*

*The Ten Evils and Fourfold Heavy Sins,*
*The Fourfold Heavy Sins—some say: Demon, Prison, Ghost, Beast.*
*Others say: Struck by lightning, plague, thieves, and prisons.*
*The Five Grievous Offenses against parents.*
*As Mencius said, the Five Unfilial Acts:*
*Laziness in limbs, indulging in gambling and drink,*
*Greed for wealth, favoring one’s own wife and children,*
*Following ear and eye desires,*
*To the point of killing one’s parents,*
*Or reckless bravery endangering them.*
*Others say: Lack of sincerity, filial piety, obedience, and propriety—these are the Five Offenses.*

*With faith, invoking the Emperor’s name,*
*Crimes vanish with each utterance.*

*The Five Decays:*
*The crown of pearls shatters, the body bends,*
*The head bows, eyes dim, nose leaks,*
*The body loses luster,*
*The Celestial Robe is tattered,*
*The shadow is exposed,*
*The spirit’s movement becomes sluggish.*
*These are the signs of fate’s convergence.*

*Kluster (克家): When past karma meets its due.*
*Derzhin (迅): Swift as lightning.*
*Bao (雹): Hail, icy rain.*
*Si (伺): Lurking in darkness to harm others.*
*Those who harm themselves through unnatural desires—*
*They perish utterly, not as misfortune.*

*The Four Directions, the Eight, and the Thirty-two Heavenly Lords.*
*Those who hold this scripture speak in Mysterious Marvels,*
*Words rare and revered,*
*Wherever they go, all honor them with sincere respect.*

*The Seven Ancestors:*
*The father, grandfather, great-grandfather, high-ancestor,*
*The ancestral root, the ancestor who opened the forest,*
*The ancestor who established the surname—these are the Seven Ancestors.*

*Fluxing Victory (炽胜): Great radiance and display.*
*With boundless compassion, all are led to the Highest Purity,*
*The Great Luo Realm.*

*This verse extols the Jade Emperor’s virtue in the Jade Scripture,*
*Urging all to revere and uphold it.*

**Chapter Ten: Protection and Upholding**

Thus, the Celestial Venerable addressed the Four Assemblies:
*"For mortals who hold and recite this scripture,*
*Who receive and invoke the Emperor’s name,*
*All are rooted deeply in the Dao,*
*With past merits of kindness.*
*This scripture is sublime and noble,*
*Universal salvation for Heaven and humanity.*
*With sincere devotion, families and nations prosper,*
*Life is preserved, disasters averted,*
*All inauspiciousness is swept away.*

*When kings and nobles uphold it,*
*The land achieves great peace,*
*Bandits and rebels are subdued,*
*Borderlands remain undisturbed,*
*The people sing in joy,*
*All under Heaven thrives,*
*Fate’s cycles turn favorably,*
*The True Way prevails.*
*Those who possess it are held in reverence by the Celestial Worthies.*
*It is a treasure to be guarded in secrecy."*

Thus, the Primordial Celestial Venerable addressed the Four Assemblies:

*"All mortals in this world who hold and recite this scripture, receiving and invoking the Sacred Emperor’s name, are deeply rooted in the Dao—just as the Confucian sage speaks of innate endowment pure and profound, or as the Buddhist speaks of favorable roots and capacity. They bear past merits of kindness, having in former ages and past kalpas broadly cultivated hidden virtue, already possessing auspicious connections.

For the True Way is difficult to hear, the Dharma Assembly rare to encounter, and the blessed night even rarer to meet. Some have lived through ages without hearing the True Dharma; some hear yet do not believe or awaken, failing to grasp it fully or reap its true benefit. These are those whose roots and capacity are shallow, whose karmic connections are thin.

Now, in this Dharma Assembly, hearing the True Dharma and receiving its true benefit—all have through countless kalpas cultivated the Dao, their roots deeply established, their past merits profound. This scripture is sublime and noble, universally saving Heaven and humanity. But with sincere devotion, reverent offering, and humble veneration of this scripture, families and nations achieve peace, life is preserved and disasters averted, longevity secured and calamities dispelled.

The ancient sages and worthies had birth and death, faced disasters and misfortune—how could they claim to preserve life and avert disasters? Rather, they preserved the Heavenly Mandate and maintained true *qi*, enduring trials with daily ease, meeting death with serenity, finding no distinction between joy and sorrow. This is the true meaning of preserving life and averting disasters through the scripture.

It sweeps away all inauspiciousness—where the scripture’s power resides, all calamities vanish in secret. The virtuous receive Heaven’s favor, and all disasters are forever removed, leaving no trace of ill fortune.

As for kings and nobles: the sovereign of all under Heaven is called the *Son of Heaven* (天子), the *Emperor* (皇), or the *Sage Emperor* (帝). In the Zhou, they were called *Kings* (王). In later times, a feudal lord ruling a single state is called a *King* (王), and a vassal holding a fief is called a *Marquess* (侯). In antiquity, a marquess ruled over a hundred *li*.

Those who uphold this scripture bring their nation’s lineage to great peace. Bandits and rebels are naturally subdued—*subdued* meaning pacified. When a land follows the Dao, internal harmony and external might prevail; wicked rebels and bandits do not rise, and the four borderlands submit in tribute, all under Heaven at ease, with no wars on the frontiers. The common folk sing in joy, the land prosperous and at peace, all under Heaven flourishing.

The celestial cycles turn favorably, the *Zhenyuan* era’s auspicious rotation complete, the natural order restored. Those who possess this Dharma and embody its transformative power are held in reverence by the Celestial Worthies. It is a treasure to be guarded in secrecy—though the Great Dao universally saves all, the unworthy should not be given it lightly. The Buddha’s *True Dharma Eye Treasury* is not casually revealed to all. Confucius said: ‘Those of mediocre or lesser capacity cannot be taught the highest truths.’ True understanding must come from the heart. To treat it lightly is to profane the Heavenly.

The scripture says *guard it in secrecy*—let those who observe it understand its meaning on their own.

**Chapter Five: The Manifestation of Retribution and Verification**

At that time, the Four Venerable Ones—Compassionate Transcendence of Calamities, Seeking-Voice Savior of Suffering, Life-Saving Death-Transcending, and Ten-Thousand Blessings Body-Protecting—all rose from their seats, stepping beyond their ranks, and together addressed the Celestial Venerable:

*'In the latter ages, though mortals may bear past merits and encounter this scripture, if obstructed by malevolent influences—whether from their own heretical views, others’ deceptive teachings, perverse natures, or the hindrances of circumstance and principle—they remain doubtful from beginning to end, unable to believe in this scripture’s virtues. Such persons, in this life and future lives, will suffer what retributive punishments in the hells? We humbly pray the Saintly Compassion may explain the agonies of their retributive realms of suffering.'*

The Four Venerable Ones—Compassionate Transcendence of Calamities, Seeking-Voice Savior of Suffering, Life-Saving Death-Transcending, and Ten-Thousand Blessings Body-Protecting—all rose from their seats, stepping beyond the ranks of the gods, and together addressed the Primordial Celestial Venerable:

*'In the latter ages, though mortals may bear past merits and encounter this scripture, if obstructed by malevolent influences—whether from their own heretical views, others’ deceptive teachings, perverse natures, or the hindrances of circumstance and principle—they remain doubtful from beginning to end, unable to believe in this scripture’s virtues. Such persons, in this life and future lives, will suffer what retributive punishments in the hells? We humbly pray the Saintly Compassion, the Celestial Venerable, may explain the agonies of their retributive realms of suffering.'*

All beings bear karmic consciousness, each drawn to their own inclinations—whether good or evil, endlessly cycling through rebirth, unable to escape. The Great Saints and Perfect Ones transcend past habits, uproot defilements, purify consciousness and karma, sever all realms of existence, and with all obstructions removed, suffer no retribution or rebirth.

The great bodhisattvas, minor immortals, minor saints, divine generals, and ghostly spirits—those of virtue take cultivation as their path, those of vice are bound by their deeds. Virtuous beings need no further mention; the wicked, however, sink into their karmic prisons, their retributions endless, with no escape or remedy. When their karma is exhausted, they are reborn elsewhere, only to be dragged again by karmic ties, lost in delusion, wandering through kalpas without end. Such is their karmic fate—truly pitiful.

The Four Venerable Ones, moved by great compassion, implored the Celestial Venerable to speak of these retributive sufferings.

Now, regarding the teachings on retribution: Confucian scholars deny it not. *Tai Jia* said: *"When Heaven inflicts calamity, it may still be averted; when a man brings calamity upon himself, there is no escape."* The classics say: *"Reward the virtuous, punish the licentious."* And again: *"The responses of Heaven and man are swift as echoes."* How could they deny retribution?

The Master said: *"The gentleman cherishes the penal codes."* And again: *"Fear the Heavenly Mandate."* Thus, he does not himself do evil. When Dao and righteousness delight the heart, there is no other path.

In past dynasties, at the *xiangyin* and archery rites, they taught the people through lectures on law and order, guiding them not by coercion but by nurturing their inherent goodness.

「The teachings of both Dao and Buddhism on retribution and penal codes serve only to uproot their karmic inclinations and lead them toward great virtue. Alas! Only the sage, through divine instruction and governance, commands the reverence of all.

The Jade Emperor’s merit and virtue are supreme, hence the scriptures clearly demonstrate retribution to rescue beings from evil paths, never deceiving the multitude. If one does not cultivate the True Dao, but merely dazzles others with talk of reward and punishment, this is to deceive them. Those who study the scriptures must renounce desire and attain the True Dao to escape personal retribution and suffering, only then can they save and guide the world.

The *Yingying* [應驗] chapters continue with twelve more sections. At that time, the Heavenly Sage addressed the Four True Ones [四真人], saying: *"If there are beings in the world who are obstinate, fierce, and cruel—unbenevolent creatures whose speech and deeds harm all beings—who day and night face the Daoist images without reverence, uttering blasphemous words, they shall incur the crime of falling into the Five Boundless [五無間] Prisons.*

If they encounter one who holds this scripture, who employs all means to persuade, guide, and rescue them, then such beings—able to extinguish their evil thoughts, take faith in this scripture, and purify all their crimes without remainder—shall be redeemed. At that time, the Original Heavenly Sage addressed the Four True Ones of Compassionate Salvation and Deliverance [慈悲度厄等四真人], saying:

*"If there are beings in the world who are obstinate, fierce, and cruel—those bold and coarse in name, unbenevolent beings whose speech and deeds harm all beings—who day and night face the Daoist images without reverence, uttering blasphemous words, they shall incur the crime of falling into the Five Boundless [五無間] Prisons. The Five Prisons are the great penal realms of the Underworld; non-sages have no recourse, thus they fall into these crimes. Observe the solar laws [陽律] for blasphemous slander, and you shall know the gravity of slandering the divine.

If they encounter one who holds this scripture, who employs all means to save and guide them, then those who defy the divine and slander the scriptures have deep-rooted karmic tendencies, clinging stubbornly to their delusions, lacking faith. The scripture-holder, through boundless compassion and skillful means, awakens, persuades, and leads them, revealing their true nature, fostering benevolent thoughts. Thus, those who defy the divine and slander the scriptures, if they extinguish all their evil thoughts, take faith in this scripture, and devote themselves wholly to it, shall have their crimes purified without remainder. Their karmic debts shall be erased, retribution fulfilled, and they shall forever be free from transgression, never returning to cyclic suffering, always pure and clear, with evil retribution forever removed and no unresolved karmic debts remaining.

The Five Boundless [五無間] hells—where crimes are difficult to purify—if one steadfastly takes faith in the True Scriptures, the evil roots shall be severed, all defilements extinguished, and what bonds remain? The roots and defilements shall be utterly destroyed, with no karmic residue. The divine virtue and scriptural efficacy are the greatest benefits; both Dao and Buddhism emphasize crimes of retribution, sternly warning against defying the divine and slandering the scriptures.

Confucian scholars often admonish irreverence toward spirits and gods—does this mean Confucians do not revere the divine or honor scriptures? The *Book of Odes* states: *"Do not disgrace your birth."* Master Zhang [張子] says: *"To not fear the gods peering through the roof beams is to disgrace your birth."* Again, it says: *"Cultivate the heart and nurture the nature, without negligence."* The teachings of both Dao and Buddhism speak of revering the divine, honoring the scriptures, and fostering the heart to cultivate the Dao, never falling short in devotion to Heaven, Earth, and the divine, and embodying the scriptures’ truth.

Confucians teach that one should not flatter the gods, warning only against seeking rewards through improper reverence. Serving Heaven means fearing Heaven’s mandate, aspiring to Heaven’s will, and honoring the teachings of the ancient kings, with solemn respect like a swift-chariot race or a galloping steed—Confucianism and the two teachings are one in this regard. If sacrifices bring no benefit, reverence is insufficient, and the mandate of Heaven is not to be feared, these are hollow words. Confucian scholars also condemn them sternly—why single out the other two traditions?

Alas! Benevolence and malevolence, reverence and neglect, all arise from the heart. If one can sever emotional desires, abandon worldly perceptions, empty the Five Aggregates [五蘊], and remove the Five Fetters [五累], then one shall not be bound by the Five Elements [五行], nor by Heaven and Earth, and the Five Boundless [五無間] Prisons shall not touch them. The Buddha says: *"To chant the Buddha’s name transforms the fiery pit into a lotus pond."* Mencius says: *"To recite the words of Yao and follow Yao’s deeds is to be Yao himself."* Thus, the true efficacy of virtue and goodness is immediately manifest.

The *Imperial Canon with Commentaries* [皇經集注] concludes Volume Eight and begins Volume Nine.»

**Chapter Thirteen of the *Verification Section* (Continued)**

If there be one with perverse views, foolish obstinacy, and malevolent intent—who, upon seeing this scripture held, gives rise to all manner of hostility—with sidelong, malevolent glances, even to the point of harboring a single evil thought or uttering a single evil word, and falsely slandering those who uphold this scripture, then his guilt is profound and grave. When his life expires, he shall fall into the Great Earthly Prison, with no hope of release.

Not only is the crime of blaspheming the sacred and slandering the scripture grave. If there be one with perverse views, foolish and muddled, ensnared in delusion—who, upon seeing those who recite this scripture (for *sight* is *seeing*), harbors doubt and disbelief—then he fails to recognize that this scripture is the Dao’s true words, its laws, and its teachings. He holds it in contempt, belittles it, and in aversion, slanders and defames it. He gives rise to transgressions and rebellious deeds, casting sidelong, askew glances, taking no pleasure in seeing the scripture or those who uphold it. He lacks the steadfast, pure gaze of right observation, but instead fixes his gaze with malice, scorns and despises it, even to the point of harboring a single evil thought or uttering a single evil word, falsely slandering those who uphold this scripture.

*Slander* is both praise and defamation. To uphold the scripture and do good cannot be defamed. Yet those with perverse fixation and malice, ignorant of the karmic causes of guilt and merit, unaware of the virtue of holding this scripture, falsely give rise to slanderous, abusive words against those who uphold it. Their guilt is profound and grave.

When his life is *exhausted*—for *exhausted* means *ended*—

Falling into the Great Hell—**Avīci**—the **Uninterrupted Prison**, with no term for release. *Permanent* means *eternal*, *endless*. Through false slander of the True Dharma, the karmic roots are profound and heavy; thus, one falls into hell and finds it difficult to escape.

For **cognition** is singular. If perception is not upright, it becomes perverse. Humanity is singular; if one clings in delusion and fails to awaken, one becomes **foolish**, becomes **evil**. The heart is singular; if it gives rise to malevolent thoughts, it becomes **rebellious**. The eyes are singular; if they gaze askew, it becomes **transgression**. A single thought, though minute, is singular—if one harbors a single evil intention, it becomes the root of karmic cause. A single word, though few, is singular—if one utters a single evil speech, it becomes the origin of sin.

The **Noble One** perfects the singular virtue, praises others’ goodness, and those who uphold the scripture should be commended. Yet to falsely give rise to slander is to invite calamity upon oneself. Human life originally has no inherent karmic debt—one incurs guilt through self-inflicted transgression, and this is truly lamentable.

When life is *exhausted*—for *exhausted* means *ended*—one returns to the cycle of transformation, bound by no fixed constraint. Yet even a single instance of slandering the Dharma casts one into the Great Hell, where death itself brings no peace. How then can one escape without end?

Heaven’s heart is benevolent and loving; the **Supreme Sovereign** cherishes life, and the **Divine** is just, not drowning the people. Yet those who commit crimes with no hope of release—is this Heaven’s imprisonment? The calamity is self-made; fixed karma cannot be evaded. To eliminate one’s own karmic debt, one must rely on self-rectification. If one steadfastly pursues the utmost goodness, the karmic roots will be severed.

Alas! The punishments of hell are Heaven’s retribution; the law is impartial—no father can shield his son, nor a filial child spare his parent. The Divine is utterly just; how could it erase self-inflicted karmic consequences?

If one takes refuge in the scripture and turns toward the Dharma, sincerely repents past transgressions—just as a worldly person who surrenders in truth may be spared their crime—then one may escape.

In this mortal life, the wise and foolish differ not in essence. If one cannot speak with measured words, let one’s voice conform to the **Laws**; yet do not utter falsehoods as **evil speech**. If one cannot act without fault, let one’s body be the **Measure**; yet do not commit **evil deeds** and incur bodily karmic debt. If one cannot keep the mind free from delusion, guarding the **Ultimate Truth**, then do not give rise to malevolent intentions and incur mental karmic debt.

If one does not know the **Great Dao**, do not slander the **Way**; if one does not understand the scripture, do not contradict it; if one cannot recite and uphold it, do not slander others; if one does not comprehend the **ghostly**, **life and death**, **cause and effect**, do not give rise to destructive speech. With a single mind of upright faith, one will gradually illuminate the **One Dao**, becoming a **Sage of Truth**—what karmic guilt could then remain?

**Verification Chapter (Continuation of the Fourteen Chapters)**

As for men and women in this world who encounter this scripture yet do not generate reverence, defiling it with unclean hands, reading aloud with a **polluted mouth**—one who has consumed the **Five Impurities** and **Five Spices**, or who places it upon an impure bed or seat—such treatment is utterly improper. Or if one recites this scripture while engaging in idle conversation, laughing and jesting as if it were a mundane text, treating it as a common classic—such a person, after death, falls into the **Uninterrupted Prison**, with no term for release. Their suffering extends to their **Nine Ancestors**, subjecting them to the **Tribunal of the Underworld**, entangling their descendants and harming future generations.

In hell, they endure unimaginable torments across countless **kalpas**. Even if they encounter sacred teachings and are repeatedly rescued, their sins diminish only slightly. If they then meet the **Supreme Sage’s special grace**, they may escape hell and be reborn as a **Hungry Ghost**, enduring for thousands of millions of **kalpas** without even hearing the name of **porridge**. Once their ghostly karmic debt is exhausted, they are reborn among **Animals**, and upon fulfilling that debt, if they are reborn as humans, they are cast into **barbaric lands**, reduced to **female form**, plagued by poverty, suffering, deformity, and countless diseases. They endure unbearable torments, despised by all, neither able to live nor die. This is the retribution for treating this scripture with contempt.

This is the **uttermost consequence of disrespecting the scripture**. To fail to generate reverence means to lack **respect, admiration, and veneration**. To defile it with unclean hands means to handle or point to the scripture with impure hands. To recite with a **polluted mouth** is to read while one’s mouth is tainted by the **Five Impurities** and **Five Spices**, or by the **Three Taboos**. To place it upon an impure bed or seat means to rest the scripture upon an unclean couch, table, or platform. Or to recite this scripture while speaking in **vulgar language**, laughing and jesting as if it were a trivial text—such a person not only incurs their own karmic retribution but also brings calamity upon their **Nine Ancestors**: the **First Ancestor**, the **Four昭 (Zhāo)**, and the **Four穆 (Mù)**.

They are subjected to the **Tribunal of the Underworld**—either **investigated for their transgressions** or **tortured**—as lesser spirits punish the household head for offenses. Their suffering extends to their descendants, entangling future generations. A family burdened with misdeeds faces additional calamity, enduring great torment and boundless affliction. Even if they encounter sacred teachings and are repeatedly rescued, their sins diminish only slightly—this is the merit of the scripture’s power reducing their guilt. If they then meet the **Supreme Sage’s special grace**, the **Divine’s pardon**, they may escape hell’s torments. As **Hungry Ghosts**, they suffer for thousands of millions of **kalpas**, their throats too narrow to swallow even the name of **porridge**. Once their ghostly karmic debt is exhausted, they are reborn among **Animals**, their karmic burden still unresolved.

Though humanity is singular, one may struggle to be reborn in **China**, let alone as a **male**. Instead, they are cast into **barbaric lands**, reduced to **female form**—the least favored state among humans. They endure **poverty, cold, hunger, and hardship**, **deformity, disease, and endless suffering**, despised by all. They neither attain birth nor escape death, all because they treated this scripture with contempt. To incur such grave karmic guilt—how lamentable!

Human life is a participant in the **Three Powers of Heaven and Earth**, this body precious, relying on it to honor ancestors and benefit descendants, transmitting the **Dao** and sustaining what is entrusted—its weight is not slight. Yet to disrespect the scripture and the Dharma brings suffering upon oneself, entangles one’s ancestors, and dooms future generations. To endure such karmic retribution—how utterly foolish!

Again, examining the scriptures of the **Three Teachings**, it is said that the **fundamental nature** of male and female is undifferentiated—everywhere, in all places, they are lands of **bliss**. The *Zhongyong* states:

*"In wealth or poverty, in high or low station, in peace or adversity,
To act in accordance with one’s proper place—
Then one finds contentment in all circumstances."*

Yet now it speaks of those in **foreign lands** as female forms, bearing bodies of **sickness and hardship**, despised by all—why is this so?

It is because the **undifferentiated** attain **self-realization**—this is the **Dao**.
To distinguish by ranks and speak of **guilt and reward**—this is **retribution**.
When retribution is clear, then people will strive to do good.

Alas! Humans are all the same—all may become virtuous beings.
Strive earnestly to advance the **Way**, avoid **karmic offenses**, lest you become an object of hatred.

**Continuation of the *Yinying* Chapter (Chapter 15):**

There are yet others who, though initially **faithful and receptive**, later grow **neglectful and careless**. The **Children of Virtue and Vice** then report them to the **Three Officials**, their names recorded in the **Black Ledger**, their merits subtracted from the **Blue Register**. After death, they are confined to **dark prisons**, wandering the **Three Realms** without escape.

Some, in this very life, suffer **various diseases**—**scabies, leprosy, carbuncles, and ulcers**—as their **fruit of retribution**. They are tormented by **grief and anguish**, day and night.

Or they are **slain by violence**, or imprisoned in chains, or meet **untimely death** by poison. Some are devoured by **tigers, wolves, venomous snakes**, or dragged by **grievous debts**. Some, wandering in forests, are **murdered by bandits** and cast into ravines. Others are **harmed by malevolent spirits and demons**, or perish in **fires and floods**, or are **slaughtered by blades and weapons**.

Because they **despised this scripture**, their lives are cut short in **premature death**, reaping such **fruit**, such **retribution**—how can one not grieve?
How can one not lament?

The **benefits of this scripture’s law** are not merely for those who **utterly reject faith**. There are also those who, though initially **faithful without doubt**, later grow **remiss and careless**. The **Children of Virtue and Vice**—those who record the **good and evil deeds of mortals**—report them to the **Three Officials**, their names inscribed in the **Black Ledger**.

The **Black Ledger** records **transgressions**.
It records the **guilt of neglecting sacred scriptures**.
The **Blue Register** subtracts the **merits** of those who **despise the scriptures**. After death, they are **imprisoned in dark dungeons**, bound in **judicial chains**, wandering the **Three Realms** in endless suffering, with no means of liberation.

The **karmic fruits** of this life may manifest as **various afflictions**—**scabies, leprosy, festering sores, and malignant diseases**—as **retribution for past misdeeds**. **Anxiety, sorrow, and torment** assail them day and night, **grinding them in despair**. Or they may suffer **sudden calamities and misfortunes**, **imprisonment in chains**, or **untimely death by their own hand**. Or they may be **maimed by poison**, **devoured by tigers, wolves, or venomous serpents**. Or they may be **dragged into ruin by creditors**, or **slain by bandits in the wilderness**, **thrown from cliffs**, their bodies and lives shattered. Or they may be **harmed by malevolent spirits and demons**. Or they may perish in **fires or floods**, or be **slaughtered by blades and spears**. Through **neglect of this scripture**, they **meet a premature end**, **cut down in their prime**, **dying without fulfillment**.

To suffer such **karmic consequences**, to endure such **retribution**—how can one not grieve? How can one not lament?

When one **laments their suffering**, one also **regrets their folly**—this is the **great compassion of the Celestial Sage**.

**Verification of Doubt:**
He who **later grows remiss and careless** toward this scripture shall face **endless punishments**. Thus, one must **revere the Dao and uphold the scriptures**, **treasuring constancy**. When the **Dao’s transformation is complete**, the **scripture’s efficacy is fulfilled**, and all shall **reap its virtue**, **attaining its effects**.

Yet humans lack constancy—**diligent at first, slack at last**—so it is no wonder that **guilt and misdeeds befall them**. From ancient times to now, the **unworthy have always existed**; many **do not uphold the scripture**, many **have never heard it**, yet those who suffer **guilt and calamities are countless**. Are they all **those who despise the scripture**?

The scripture **speaks of the Dao**; if one **does not believe in the Dao**, they lack **virtue**—this is **despising the scripture**. Without virtue, there is **guilt**—this is the **sin of despising the scripture**. To **honor the scripture and dissolve guilt**, one must **advance in the Dao and cultivate virtue**.

**Continuation of the Verification Chapter (16):**
You must **earnestly follow** this and **practice it diligently**, **generating no wicked thoughts**. If **all thoughts cease**, all **worldly ties are extinguished**; **dust-like malevolent deeds** vanish with the mind, and **all disasters and demons are naturally eradicated**.

This scripture’s **merits and virtues are beyond measure**—**truly the supreme, matchless, wondrous law**, the **king of all scriptures**, with **great benefit**. **Do not reveal it to the unworthy.**

The Celestial Sage said to the **True Ones**:
*"The retribution for despising the scripture is as such. You must **earnestly and sincerely** follow this scripture’s law without fail, **generating no wicked thoughts.** If **all impure thoughts do not arise**, neither **good nor evil**, neither **non-thought nor non-non-thought**, all **worldly ties are extinguished**—

**Emptying the Five Bonds**, **clearing the Nine Consciousnesses**, **transcending the Four Symbols**, **severing the Hundred Defilements**, **emptying the Ten Thousand Phenomena**, **annihilating the One Mind**—**external ties, internal ties, karmic ties, ties of fortune**—all **empty, pure, and wondrous**—**past lives, present lives, clinging to the future**—**all are severed**. **All roots and dust are exhausted**; **dust-like malevolent deeds** vanish with the mind.

The **dust of the world**, like the **sands of the Ganges**, is **incalculable**. Thus, **all such deeds**, with the **faith in this scripture**, **are all dissolved**. **All disasters and demons are naturally eradicated**; **all calamities and demons are utterly destroyed**.

This scripture’s **merits and virtues are beyond measure**—**truly the supreme, matchless, wondrous law**. **All Three Teachings, all laws—none can compare**. This is **truly the supreme, wondrous law**, the **king of all scriptures**, the **scripture of the Two Gates**. **All other books—even those of the Confucian scholars—fall short**. It is the **king of all Three Teachings’ scriptures**, with **great benefit**. **Do not reveal it to the unworthy.**

Though the **Dao may be learned by all**, it **cannot be transmitted to those without faith or reverence**. **Do not reveal it to the unworthy**; **do not transmit it to those who do not hold the Dao in high regard.**

**Resolution of Doubt:**
The **Confucian scholars do not instruct the self-destructive**. The **Buddha does not enlighten the unworthy**. The **Dao’s law is most exalted**—how could it be **forced upon the faithless?**

Alas! **Faith is the foundation for advancing in the Dao**; **true resolve is essential for attaining sainthood**. Without faith, one **cannot be entrusted with the scripture**. **Humans must strive with utmost sincerity**, making it the **root of receiving the scripture and entering sainthood.**

**Continuation of the Verification Chapter (17):**
If **celestial beings and humans**, facing the **Five Decays and Four Phases of Decline**, are **beset by the wheel of rebirth**, yet **abandon all delusions** and **uphold this scripture**, they will **naturally attract blessings**, **fortifying their celestial fortune**, **transcending the Three Realms**, and **abiding with the Dao eternally**.

This scripture is **most exalted**—**it should not be recklessly revealed to all**.

If **celestial beings and humans** of the **Six Desire Realms** still **cling to sensual pleasures**, those of the **Eighteen Color Realms** **retain colored forms**, those of the **Four Formless Realms** **find bliss in emptiness**, and those of the **Four Great Brahmas**—though **knowing emptiness and non-existence**, lacking **hopes of delight**—yet **enjoy tranquil blessings in measure**—all these **celestial realms**, though **differing in kind**, are **inferior to the Four Celestial Kindreds**, who **know no rebirth or decay**.

The **Five Decays** have been explained before. The **Four Phases** refer to:
- The **decline of non-humans, humans, beings, and long-lived ones** in **fortune and virtue** (four phases).
- Or **birth, vigor, old age, and exhaustion** (four phases).
- Or **lack of dignity, lack of supernatural powers, lack of joy, lack of vitality** (four phases).

The **wheel of rebirth presses upon them**—the **thirty-two heavens of Desire, Form, Brahmas, and Formlessness**, differing in **duration**. When their **celestial blessings are exhausted**, they **reincarnate into the mortal world**, each with **fixed destiny**—hence, **"rebirth."**

**Abandoning all delusions** means:
Delusion arises from **clinging to worldly ties**—whether **coveting blessings, wisdom, longevity, emptiness, meditation, ascension, or descent**. What the **eyes cannot see**, what the **mind cannot exhaust**—all are **delusion**. To **abandon all thoughts**, to **let no single tie arise**, to **be empty of emptiness**—this is **abandoning illusory thoughts**.

When **delusion is abandoned**, one **naturally attracts blessings**; **celestial fortune is fortified**—**without seeking, blessings come naturally**.

The **Four Realms**—Desire, Form, Formless, and Brahmalokas—each **allows one to transcend from their own abode**.

**No longer subject to rebirth**, they **suffer no ruin or decline**, achieving **great firmness and stability**, never entering the cycle of rebirth.

**Liberating the body from the Three Realms**:
To **exit the Desire Realm**, ascend to the Form Realm, and further reach the Formless and Brahmalokas—**transcending the Three Realms of existence** (samsara)—one **soars beyond the forms of heaven, earth, and humanity**, attaining the **lofty, mysterious heights**.

**Eternal alongside the Dao**:
In **harmony with the Dao**, they **endure through boundless ages**. Observing the **transformative power of celestial and human scriptures**, one may **grasp the truth**.

**Exhortation**: The **Eighteen Chapters of the *Yingpin* Sutra** are this very scripture—**unmatched and unsurpassable**, possessing **great awe-inspiring virtue and power**, a **mighty divine spell**—capable of **reviving withered branches and leaves**, making **flowers and fruits flourish abundantly**. It can **banish the most profound suffering and afflictions of all beings**, and **grant long life to those with short spans**.

This scripture’s **merits and virtues are beyond reckoning**, praise **cannot exhaust them**.

For those who **do not believe in this scripture**, their **karma is thus**; for **celestial and human beings who trust it**, its **effects are thus**. This scripture is **unmatched and unsurpassable**; all other **sutras and teachings** fall beneath it, **none equal**, **none superior**. All benefits of other scriptures and teachings **cannot compare** to this, **none surpass it**.

This is **great awe-inspiring virtue and power**—**either eliminating evil or supporting the true**. If a teaching **cannot both eliminate evil and extinguish sins while upholding the true and perfecting virtue**, it **does not qualify as awe-inspiring virtue and power**. Yet this scripture’s **law both eliminates evil and eradicates offenses**, **strengthens the true and fulfills virtue**—its **divine efficacy and wondrous merits are immeasurable**, hence it is called **awe-inspiring virtue and power**.

As for its **mighty divine spell**, see the earlier explanation. It can **revive withered branches and leaves**, making **flowers and fruits flourish abundantly**. All **grasses, trees, rare flowers, uncommon vegetables, auspicious fungi, and sacred incense**—whatever **cannot thrive and grow naturally**—and all **dried, withered, or damaged plants**, this scripture **restores to life, sprouting branches and leaves**, **blossoms and fruits**, **flourishing and multiplying abundantly**.

It can **banish the most profound suffering and afflictions of all beings**. This scripture **dissolves all karma**, benefiting **living beings**; **extracts all sins**, benefiting **the dying**. It **removes demonic calamities**, **secures human happiness**. Through **countless ages of karmic retribution and desire**, or **lifelong vexation and torment**, the **heaviest suffering endured across generations**—this scripture **eradicates their very roots**.

It can **grant long life to those with short spans**. Among mortals, **seventy years is rare**. This scripture **preserves life and extends vitality**, enabling **those who die young or live briefly** to **calculate and prolong their years**, achieving **long life**.

Some say, **"Yanzi, the second Sage, lived only thirty years—this proves that Daoist virtue/power (德) brings no benefit. Why claim that this scripture extends life?"** Yet **true longevity is not dying**. Yanzi, **suddenly enlightened**, **did not die**. The scripture speaks of **extending the life of those with short spans**, meaning it **allows beings to attain enlightenment and thus not die**.

This scripture’s **merits and virtues are beyond reckoning**, praise **cannot exhaust them**. Its **glory is endless**.

Ah, the loyalty and righteousness of Lord Ke—his virtue stands like bamboo groves after the axe;
the filial piety and brotherly love of the Tian clan—his descendants revive like chaste plants reborn.

When the Sage rules above, even common households may be ennobled—life and death bring swift joy.
To attain the fullness of the Great Dao is to encompass all beings in virtue and power without distinction.

Let those who study this scripture strive earnestly—its highest merit is self-attained.

**The Chapter of Manifestations (续十九章):**
If one has not in past lives cultivated the Dao’s root,
or sown fields of merit broadly,
even the name of this scripture may go unheard—
how much less could one hope to see it?

The scripture’s virtue and power are boundless.

If one has not in past lives cultivated the Dao’s root—
the root is like the foundation.
The gentleman attends to the foundation,
for when the foundation stands, the Dao arises—
thus it is called *Dao-ben* (道本).
Some mistakenly call it *Dao-zhong* (道种)—this is incorrect.
*Host* (宿) means *previously* or *in advance*;
*plant* (植) means *establish*, *nurture*, or *sow*.
The Dao’s root is the gradual cultivation of the fundamental path.

The Dao scriptures say: *The Great Dao is nameless—*
through precise cultivation, it is perfected.
Confucius said: *Study the lesser to attain the greater.*
The Buddha scriptures say: *From hearing and reflection to meditation,*
entering *samādhi* (三摩地).
The Three Teachings all emphasize learning—
this is the foundation for attaining the Dao.

Yet though enlightenment may come suddenly,
it requires gradual practice—
not all can be accomplished in a single step.

If one has not in past lives or this life
prepared through cultivation,
or planted the Dao’s root and sown fields of merit broadly—
*Fo-tian* (福田), where deeds bear fruit like cultivated fields,
is thus named.

**External practices** include:
refurbishing Daoist halls, Buddhist temples, hermitages, shrines, ancestral halls, pagodas, community altars,
building bridges, roads, and administering medicine to heal the sick—
assisting the state, saving lives, casting talismans for relief,
praying for blessings, ensuring progeny, benefiting all beings,
exorcising evil, averting calamities, relieving suffering,
and rescuing the poor.

**Inner cultivation** encompasses:
compassion and mercy, joy in giving, endurance of insults,
harmonizing brilliance, universal benefit without selfishness,
and unshakable, perfect fulfillment.

**Coarse practices** involve:
donating wealth, clothing, and food.
**Secret practices** include:
meditating on the Dao, contemplating the True One,
abstaining from desire to nourish the spirit,
accumulating essence and refining qi.

The path to sainthood and transcendence varies endlessly—
countless fields of merit await cultivation.

Sowing the fields of this world, the seasons bring drought or flood,
human affairs are uneven—sometimes the harvest fails.
But sowing the fields of merit, even a little yields results,
and great efforts bring great rewards.

The hidden virtues are countless—
unknown to others, unspeakable in full,
their merit is boundless.

If one does not sow the fields of merit,
even the name of this scripture may not be heard.
Without virtue or fortune, one does not hear its name.
The scripture says: *"The True Law is rarely encountered"*—
this is what it means.

How much more rare to actually see this scripture?
To see this true scripture is to open the Dao-eye.
Without virtue or fortune, how could one hear its name,
let alone see it?

Mortal fates differ—some receive blessings, others wisdom.
The wealthy may be foolish without virtue;
the poor may be sage-like without fortune.
When virtue and fortune align, one gains rank, wealth, and longevity.
If one encounters the True Law, insight dawns—
without eons of cultivation, its merit would not be so vast.

The Buddha’s assembly of a hundred million,
the True Law entrusted to Kāśyapa;
Confucius’ three thousand disciples,
the single thread passed to Zēng Sān.
The Dao’s multitude—countless myriads—
inheriting the Supreme Mystic’s heart-law,
beginning with Wénshǐ.

Observe and strive accordingly.

**Continuation of the *Yīnyìng* Chapter (Twenty Chapters)**
This scripture follows the Three Caverns’ true pattern,
transmitted once every eighty thousand kalpas.
It is treasured by the Most High True Sage of the Pure Celestial,
hidden in the Jade Capital’s Golden Gate,
exceedingly subtle, rarely encountered.

If one has innate Dao-bones in a past life,
they shall become a True Immortal of the Nine Heavens.
Encountering this text, inheriting this fate—
later, bearing gold and jade, they shall pledge allegiance to a master,
then ride the moment, align with destiny,
and only then may it be entrusted.

Do not reveal it lightly—revere it, guard it carefully.
This scripture is not lightly transmitted.
It follows the Three Caverns’ true pattern:
*Cavern of Truth, Cavern of Mystery, Cavern of Spirit*—
these three divisions bear the celestial laws in gold.
*True Pattern* refers to the natural order.
*Eighty thousand kalpas*—spanning the great cycles of the universe.
One kalpa: born in the Year of the Tiger, dying in the Year of the Rooster.
Eight times eight thousand six hundred forty years—
eighty thousand years in grand reckoning.
Each year’s growth and harvest counts as one kalpa.
*Sand* refers to dust-numbers—
eighty thousand kalpas is the rare transmission of this universal law.
What was said earlier is closer to the truth.

This is the treasure of the Most High True Sage of the Pure Celestial.
*Upper Pure, Mystic Capital*—
hidden in the Jade Capital’s Golden Gate,
not the abode of the Jade Emperor,
but the pavilion of the Supreme Mystic’s treasure-scripture.
Exceedingly subtle—praising this scripture is rare.
If one has innate Dao-bones from past lives,
refined through cultivation, bearing the marks of immortality,
they shall become a True Immortal of the Nine Qi-Heavens.
Encountering this text, inheriting this fate—
later, bearing gold and jade, they shall pledge allegiance to a master,
not merely offering worldly wealth, but swearing to the heavens,
a heart pure as the sun and moon, untainted by dust,
true gold that does not decay.
Only then may they ride the moment, align with destiny,
and be entrusted with its transmission.
Do not reveal it lightly—
*leak* means to betray its essence;
do not transmit it to the unworthy.
Revere it, guard it with care.

Ah! Knowing this scripture’s weight,
all should cultivate auspicious fate
as the foundation for receiving it.
Once received, it must be cherished for eons—
treasure it, strive with it.

**Continuation of the *Yīnyìng* Chapter (Twenty-One Chapters)**

Thus, the Celestial Sovereign solemnly proclaimed this meaning
and spoke in verse:

*If the Yangtze’s waves could bear lotuses,*
*If ravens’ feathers turned white,*
*As rare as this scripture’s encounter.*

*If turtles grew fur for clothing,*
*If moonlight could melt ice,*
*As rare as this scripture’s encounter.*

*If mosquitoes’ legs built bridges,*
*Bearing all burdens,*
*As rare as this scripture’s encounter.*

*If young crows could carry mountains,*
*Hurl them to distant realms,*
*As rare as this scripture’s encounter.*

*If a single leaf could bear Kunlun,*
*Float across the great sea,*
*As rare as this scripture’s encounter.*

*If leeches grew elephant tusks,*
*As vast as jade,*
*As rare as this scripture’s encounter.*

*If broomstraw leaves could shade the boundless,*
*Cover Kunlun’s peaks,*
*As rare as this scripture’s encounter.*

*If owls and crows shared nests,*
*Nurturing each other,*
*As rare as this scripture’s encounter.*

*If rabbits grew horns for ladders,*
*Reaching the heavens,*
*As rare as this scripture’s encounter.*

*If shrews climbed rabbit-horns,*
*Devouring the moon,*
*As rare as this scripture’s encounter.*

*If donkeys’ lips turned red as *pīngpó* fruit,*
*And sang and danced,*
*As rare as this scripture’s encounter.*

*If flies could drink *zhōngshí* wine,*
*Lost in drunken stupor,*
*As rare as this scripture’s encounter.*

Thus, the Primordial Sovereign solemnly proclaimed the scripture’s merit
and spoke in verse:

*If the Yangtze’s waves could bear lotuses,*
*The deep currents, surging—*
*Ravens’ feathers never white.*
*This scripture’s encounter is beyond compare.*

Tortoises are born without fur, the moon belongs to the Dark Yin.
Now to say that tortoise fur is woven into robes,
and that the night moon melts ice—
this is merely to illustrate the utter impossibility
of encountering such a scripture.

As for mosquitoes and gnats building bridges with their feet,
carrying heavy loads;
or yellow-beaked sparrows carrying great mountains
and hurling them to other realms;
or small boats bearing the Kunlun divine mountain
across the great sea,
or leeches growing elephant-tusk teeth—
*Leech: a small water-dragon insect.*
As for *peng-hao* leaves covering boundless realms,
shading the Kunlun peaks;
or owls and crows nesting together,
mutually nurturing and repaying kindness—
*Owls and crows are both detested by true owls.*
Or rabbits growing horns as ladders to heaven,
or shrews climbing rabbit-horn ladders to devour the moon;
or donkeys’ lips turning the color of *pīngpó* fruit,
and singing and dancing;
or flies drinking *zhōngshí* wine,
lost in drunken stupor—
all these are things that must never exist,
that reason itself denies.

Each is recounted to show how rare this scripture’s encounter is.

The Great Dao belongs to all,
yet this true scripture is complete in every individual.
Even the foolish and brute creatures possess inherent virtue,
all capable of transformation and guidance—
why compare this scripture’s rarity to such impossible things?
Could it truly never be transmitted?

The teachings vary in rank—
this scripture is supreme.
Those who transmit it may not be as true as the Primordial Sovereign,
and those who receive it may not grasp the Jade Emperor’s secrets.
Obstinate and rigid minds cannot fathom the whole.
Some hear and see nothing,
others hear and see only superficially—
its merit and efficacy remain obscure.
Without full benefit, it is indeed rare to encounter.

Fear not the difficulty of difficulty—
with utmost sincerity, the scripture’s merit will manifest itself.

**Continuation of the *Yīngyàn* Chapter (Twenty-Two):**
At that time, the Celestial Sovereign having finished reciting the verse,
addressed the Four Assemblies universally:

*"In this world, if any who uphold this scripture*
*are called the *Gōngdé* Body—*
*for all sentient beings are sheltered by its grace.*

*If any who uphold this scripture*
*are called the *Shéntōng* Body—*
*for all auspiciousness gathers to them.*

*If any who uphold this scripture*
*are called the *Qīngjìng* Body—*
*for no evil deed can harm them."*

At that time, the Primordial Sovereign having finished reciting the verse,
addressed the Four Assemblies universally.
*Universal: pervasive. Four Assemblies: as previously explained.*

*"In this world, if any uphold this scripture,*
*they are called the *Gōngdé* Body.*
*To benefit the multitude is *gōng* (function),*
*to benefit all is *dé* (virtue).*
*To benefit both people and things,*
*fully and without omission,*
*is the *Xuángōng Miàodé* Body.*

*All sentient beings—*
*the living, the vegetal,*
*even the inanimate, so long as they possess essence and spirit—*
*are counted as sentient,*
*and thus are all sheltered by its grace.*
*The sages of the Three Teachings universally guide and benefit them eternally.*

*‘Covering and sheltering’ is called *yìn* (imprint).*
*Those who uphold the scripture*
*benefit themselves, benefit others, benefit all beings—*
*whether knowing or unaware,*
*universally bestowing compassionate shelter.*

*If any uphold this scripture,*
*they are called the *Shéntōng* Body.*
*Though humans are most refined,*
*they lack *shéntōng* (supernatural penetration).*
*The scripture’s wondrous laws are supremely profound and divine,*
*unobstructed and vast—*
*thus, those who truly uphold it are called the *Shéntōng* Body.*

*All auspiciousness truly gathers to them.*
*The sages of the Three Teachings eternally fulfill their destiny unbroken.*

*‘All’ is *xiān* (every),*
*‘reach’ is *zhēn* (attain),*
*‘gather’ is *jí* (converge).*
*For oneself, it brings harmony and auspiciousness;*
*for others, it brings love and impartiality;*
*for the world and state, it is never misplaced.*
*Self-attained blessings converge in myriad auspicious signs.*

*The heavens do not hoard the Dao,*
*the earth does not hoard treasure—*
*yet when humans submit to its transformation,*
*all things respond with their innate numinous power.*
*All auspiciousness gathers.*

*If any uphold this scripture,*
*they are called the *Qīngjìng* Body.*
*‘Unstained’ is *qīng*,*
*‘unburdened’ is *jìng*.*
*Those who uphold the scripture*
*extinguish all entanglements,*
*leaving no blemish—*
*thus, no evil can assail them.*

*‘Assail’ means to oppress and harm.*
*Self-made deeds invite celestial retribution,*
*past offenses now manifest,*
*ancestral sins extend to descendants,*
*calamities of the times,*
*blockages of fate,*
*astral malpositions,*
*demonic and ghostly oppression,*
*slander and malevolent influences—*
*all these evil deeds*
*are transformed from malevolent to auspicious,*
*and cannot harm.*

*Those who practice the Dao encompass heaven and earth,*
*fulfilling the needs of all things,*
*their blessings and auspiciousness unending.*
*The heavens protect them, never failing.*
*True auspicious beings suffer no calamity or harm—*
*this is the *Zhēngōngdé Shéntōng Qīngjìng* Body.*

*Though humans have bodies,*
*they are not the *Gōngdé Shéntōng Qīngjìng* Body—*
*nor do they truly uphold the scripture.*
*Strive earnestly,*
*and you may verify its efficacy yourself."*

**Continuation of the *Yīngyàn* Chapter (Twenty-Three):**
*"If any uphold this scripture,*
*they are called the *Wēidé* Body—*
*for celestial demons and heterodox paths cannot ensnare them.*

*If any uphold this scripture,*
*they are called the *Wǔděng* Body—*
*for the Celestial Sovereign sings praises from afar,*
*and all spirits revere them.*

*Those who uphold this scripture*
*are not only called the *Qīngjìng* Body*
*but also the *Wēidé* Body—*
*as previously explained.*

*Celestial demons and heterodox paths*
*include celestial demon kings,*
*demonic men and women,*
*obscure and malevolent ghosts,*
*as well as Asuras,*
*Lūshīluó,*
*and the *xiāo*, *mèi*, *wāng*, *liǎng*—*
*precise, malevolent, monstrous, and taboo entities.*
*As well as deceitful humans,*
*heretical sects,*
*and demonic, seductive, and aberrant paths.*
*They cannot ensnare them.*

*‘Ensnare’ means to subdue and bring into servitude.*
*When demons intrude,*
*people are ensnared without awareness—*
*this is called *shè* (ensnarement).*

*As in the Buddhist tradition,*
*when Ānanda was ensnared by the seductress Móluódéngjiā*
*in the chamber of lust,*
*caressed and fondled,*
*nearly violating his vows.*
*Now, those who uphold the scripture*
*have penetrated the heart-seal,*
*are without selfishness or action,*
*silently recite the true scripture,*
*their law-power complete,*
*their Dao lofty and virtue profound,*
*their awe-inspiring virtue vast and immeasurable.*
*Demons and spirits lose courage,*
*malevolent entities vanish,*
*and all evil demons*
*dare not approach the righteous.*
*Thus, celestial demons and heterodox paths cannot ensnare them.*

*Ānanda was not without precepts—*
*his mind was moved by a single thought toward Móluódéngjiā,*
*indicating he had not yet awakened to the heart-principle.*
*Had he questioned and severed [the illusion] through the scripture,*
*she would not have ensnared him."*

If not for the *Lengyan Sutra*’s power,
how could his body remain whole?

This *Huangjing*—the sovereign of all scriptures—
its received virtue and awe surpass all others ten thousandfold.

Those who uphold this scripture
are not merely named "virtue and awe in body."
Their name transcends equality in body,
a body without peer or equal in kind.

Truly, the highest without compare.
As the *Release of the Scripture* declares:
*"None surpass the Buddha."*
The Confucian texts say:
*"The Master’s excellence is beyond reach—*
*like ascending heaven without a ladder."*

The Celestial Sovereigns chant from afar—
not the Jade Emperor, but the Sovereigns of all heavens.
*"Afars"* means distant;
*"chant"* refers to the celestial harmonies that praise those advancing in the Dao.
Some say *"chant"* means *"to sing in song,"*
but this is illogical and rejected.

For when mortals give birth to a son,
the myriad spirits chant in reverence;
to a daughter, they chant in homage.
The Celestial Sovereigns delight in life,
and the heavens rejoice.
Those of the Dao, in sincerity aligning with Heaven and Earth,
move spirits and gods,
harmonizing with Heaven’s virtue—
the Celestial Sovereigns rejoice in celebration.

Yet the Sovereigns are most exalted,
differing from lesser spirits,
and their abodes in the celestial palaces
are distant—
their voices heard afar in praise.
Otherwise, why say *"Celestial Sovereigns chant from afar"*
and then *"myriad spirits respect"*?
The *"myriad spirits"* are not one—
they encompass all.
Though high or low in rank,
they all revere the Dao’s teachings.
When encountering true scripture-holders of the Way,
none fail to show reverence.

Mankind’s nature is firm, bright, and balanced—
comparable to Yuan Shi,
inherently possessing great virtue and awe,
without equal in kind.
Yet, unchecked desire allows evil to enter,
and the spirits grow disrespectful.

Ah! Zixia was a sage,
yet seeing the dazzling beauty of finery and delighting in it—
how could he, not a true Confucian disciple,
have become the Master’s foremost student?

If one remains true without deceit,
the Dao is forever complete.

**Continuation: Chapter Twenty-Four of *Application and Verification***

Those who uphold this scripture are named *"Firm-Body"*—
for great calamities cannot harm them.

Those who uphold this scripture are named *"Dao-Hidden-Body"*—
for when they speak, spirits bow in reverence.

Those who uphold this scripture
are not merely named *"Firm-Body"*—
they are named *"Dao-Hidden-Body."*

Mortals’ lives are impermanent, their cycles unknown.
Some achieve minor merit and virtue,
their blessings limited to this life;
some possess minor roots and small vehicles,
their fruits confined by bounds;
some are enlightened yet incomplete,
easily obscured, easily deceived;
some practice yet remain unfinished,
easily swayed by doubt;
some save others and aid beings,
yet their capacity is exhausted—
their bodies like floating reeds or flickering candles,
unable to withstand winds and waves.
This is not firmness.

True scripture-holders do not retreat—
their bodies are firm.
Great calamities, great disasters cannot harm them.

Whether small, medium, or great *kalpas*,
whether *yuanhui* cycles or worldly transformations,
when the Three Realms are destroyed and reborn,
when all beings perish and the earth tilts while the heavens shatter,
when the Four Wheels collide and the Five Phases clash,
when floods, fires, and winds ravage the world,
when all phenomena vanish and all teachings end—
even the Four *Dhyana* Realms, the Three Stages, and Nine Grades,
the officials, gods, and celestial attendants,
all enter the cycle of rebirth,
facing the hardship of renewed creation—
true scripture-holders attain great firmness,
transcending the *kalpas*,
forever unretreating.

Even in the *kalpas* of evil and ruin,
in the host of past karma and demonic disasters,
in unforeseen great calamities—
none can harm them.
Their constancy endures through all changes,
eternal as the ages—
unshaken.

Those who uphold this scripture
are not merely named *"Firm-Body"*—
they are named *"Dao-Hidden-Body."*
*"Hidden"* means concealed, stored.
The Dao encompasses all without exclusion,
goes everywhere with goodness.
The Dao-Hidden contains nothing unrecorded,
nothing unused.
Though the human body has limits,
its nature is fully endowed.
Yet, if the Dao is not fully realized,
the Dao-Body remains incomplete.

True scripture-holders store the depths like the sea,
contain the vast like the ocean—
their law-treasury holds countless worlds,
thus they are named *"Dao-Hidden-Body."*
When they speak, spirits bow in reverence.

*"Answering"* is called *"utterance,"*
*"self-expression"* is called *"speech."*

The human may speak, yet ghosts and gods do not revere—
for their words lack sincerity,
and idle speech brings misfortune.
Even more, they cannot escape blame—
how then can they move the hearts of humans, gods, or spirits?

The true scripture-holder’s words become faith,
uttered with measured grace—
neither hasty nor suppressed,
never failing in human truth,
never failing in sacred speech.
Sometimes a single word sustains the pulse of a thousand *True Ones*,
sometimes a single word opens the transmission for ten thousand generations,
sometimes a single word rescues beings from drowning,
sometimes a single utterance shatters the barrier between life and death,
sometimes a single word exhausts the Dao of heaven and earth,
sometimes a single utterance encompasses the mysteries of all *dharma*,
sometimes a single word reveals the very nature of ghosts and gods,
sometimes a single utterance illuminates the rise and entanglement of *kalpas* and retribution.

A single word may extinguish sin and merit,
a single utterance may reveal the elixir of gold.
The *True Essences* of the Three Teachings reside in the scripture—
a single word holds the shared treasure of all beings,
a treasure even ghosts and gods cannot perceive.
Who would not hold them in awe?

Ghosts and gods revere—
that is all.

The Three Teachings’ great sages endure through countless *kalpas* without retreat,
their words revered by heaven and humans alike,
and the steadfastness of the Dao-Hidden is now evident.
How then does one swiftly attain this?

For one gain is eternal gain—
this is the empirical truth of principle.
Only those who do not truly uphold the scripture fail to see it.
How does one truly uphold it?
Mindful abstinence is the foundation,
and divine transformation brings it to fulfillment.

*End of Volume Nine of the Imperial Canon’s Commentaries*
*End of Volume Ten of the Imperial Canon’s Commentaries*

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Manifestation Section (Continued) – The Compassionate Body**

Those who uphold this scripture are named *Compassionate Body*,
for all beings of the Six Paths rely upon their virtue.

Those who uphold this scripture are not merely called *Dao-Hidden Body*—
they are named *Compassionate Body*.
Great kindness and boundless mercy,
saving and liberating without end—
this is called *Compassionate Body*.

Humans alone harbor divergent thoughts of self and other,
distinguishing between near and distant in their minds.
Not only do they fail to universally benefit and eternally aid,
but even when they show kindness or liberate others,
their aid is limited and cannot endure—
this is not the *Compassionate Body*.

Thus, distributing wealth to others is called *benevolence*,
teaching virtue is called *loyalty*.
Small acts of private kindness are not universal salvation.
Only those who truly uphold the scripture attain this *Compassionate Body*—
the Great Compassionate Body,
the Great Merciful Body.

How is this known?
For all beings of the Six Paths rely upon their virtue.

The worlds encompass the Six Paths.
The Six Paths are teeming with beings.
The multitude of the Six Paths is boundless.

**The Heavenly Path**—high above, its blessings pure and enduring,
yet unseen in birth—
how can it be said to be numerous?
Though heaven is exalted, it still contains the Three Realms:
Desire, Form, and Formless—
all subject to arising and decay.
Even if blessings have long or short durations,
only those who truly follow the Dao endure.
All other heavenly beings,
with their transient ranks and forms,
arise and perish—
all are called *beings*.

**The Human Path**—humans are the most enlightened of all creatures.
Though they praise cultivation and propagate the Dao and Law,
they differ in noble and base stations,
male and female forms,
yet teem in countless multitudes—
billions upon billions, beyond reckoning—
this is called *beings*.

**The Asura Path**—demonic kings, demonic peoples, demonic women,
spirits of malevolence, monstrous apparitions, and unnatural calamities—
these are the demonic *beings*.

**The Hellish Path**—the Five Hells of Retribution,
the Nine Dark Prisons,
the Eighteen Great Prisons,
the Thirty-Six Prisons,
the Seventy-Two Prisons—
all suffering in the netherworld’s torments—
these are the prison-bound *beings*.

**The Hungry Ghost Path**—in the yin abyss and murky depths,
great-force ghost kings, ghostly messengers,
with elongated limbs, vast bellies, and parched throats—
for countless *kalpas* they hear no sustenance.
Such are the hungry ghost *beings*.

**The Animal Path**—those born from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation,
with feathers, fur, shells, or scales,
crawling or burrowing—
all creatures, great and small,
rely upon the compassion of those who uphold the scripture,
transcending their sufferings and shielding them from harm.
They secure the blessings of heavenly and human beings,
relieve the calamities of mortals,
prevent the descent into demonic prisons,
and extinguish the retributions of ghosts and beasts.

In one world, a thousand million worlds,
in the three thousand great thousandfold universes—
all beings of the Six Paths,
free from karmic bondage and enriched with virtue,
rely upon their goodness.
This is called *Compassion*.

Speak of the Six Paths, and all classes are exhausted.
Speak of *beings*, and all multitudes are encompassed.
All realms are thus.
From beginningless time to endless future,
beyond conception or measure—
all rely upon the virtue of those who truly uphold the scripture.
Truly, this is Great Compassion.

Alas! First liberate oneself, then others—
to save all beings of the Six Paths,
one must eternally uphold the true scripture,
achieving supreme goodness before it is possible.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Manifestation Section (Continued) – The Great Dao Body**

Those who uphold this scripture are named *Great Dao Body*,
for they fear nothing in all their comings and goings.

Those who uphold this scripture are not merely called *Compassionate Body*—
they are named *Great Dao Body*.
The Dao is formless, yet the human body has form.
Human nature encompasses the fullness of the Dao,
obtaining the principles of Heaven and Earth,
the *qi* of Heaven and Earth.
If one speaks of *Dao Body*,
every person possesses the Dao,
yet no person exhausts it.
Thus, the body given by parents is called *human body*.
The Four Great Elements are fleeting—
it is called *illusionary body*.
Untransformed by things—
it is called *common body*.
Drunk in life, dead in dreams—
it is called *ignorant body*.
Busy from dawn to dusk, sweetly hastening to old age and death—
it is called *karmic body*.
Uncultivated and unlearned, bound in endless cycles—
it is called *sinful body*.
Fragrant flowers fade swiftly, the willow’s branches are few—
it is called *impermanent body*.
Male and female differ in form, old and young in appearance—
it is called *suffering body*.
When the final hour arrives, not even kin can be spared—
it is called *lonely body*.
Wind, rain, cold, and heat assail the flesh—
it is called *suffering body*.

This is the state of mortals—
none possess the Dao.

Those who truly uphold the scripture attain the Law and become real—
this is the *Dao Body*,
not the common body,
named *Great Dao Body*.
In all their comings and goings,
they fear nothing.

*Scare* is anxiety and worry,
*Fear* is dread.
Only those who uphold the scripture are called *Great Dao Body*,
moving forth with ease, returning without burden;
whether moving or resting,
pure and detached from worldly ties,
they are ever serene—
what anxiety, what dread?
Wherever they are,
they fear nothing.

**Explanation:**
The Confucian says:
*"Be cautious in what is unseen,
fearful of what is unheard."*
Is this not *fear*?
Yet joy, anger, sorrow, thought, grief, fear, and startle—
the Seven Emotions reside in all.
If one says, *"In all comings and goings, they fear nothing,"*
it seems contrary to caution and dread.
This is not so.
Caution and dread restrain desire,
preserving the true Dao.
The Seven Emotions reveal the fullness of human nature—
they urge one to subdue passions and return to essence.
If fear arises from inner instability,
stemming from external calamities,
and one is gripped by dread,
this is not the true path.
Thus the Master said:
*"Examine oneself and find no guilt—
what then to fear?"*
How can there be anxiety or dread?
In all their comings and goings, they fear nothing,
for body and Dao are one—
wherever they go, they are at ease.
The Confucian says:
*"Seeing the Great, the heart is tranquil."*
This aligns with their state.
Those who uphold the scripture move without fear—
this is natural, not forced.

Forced constraint, then the *Mòzǐ*’s "unmoved heart" is ultimately not the Dao’s realization.
Natural spontaneity, then the Master’s "no doubt from the heart" and Mencius’ "unmoved heart" all align with this scriptural truth.
Truly, the two teachings’ doctrine of the heart proclaims:
*"Suchness, natural and unshaken—
the Dao of divine transformation is here."*

If one forcibly grasps and does not self-transform,
holding fast yet failing to endure—
though no fear arises, it still does not accord with this scripture’s intent.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven of the *Yànyàn* Section (Continuation):**
Those who uphold this scripture are called *liángyī shēn*—
the "Body of the Skilled Physician," for they practice wondrous methods to bring ease to all.

Those who uphold this scripture are not merely called *Dàdào shēn*—
they are called *liángyī shēn*.
The physician is fitting—
medicine and illness must align to remove afflictions.

Worldly physicians examine forms and discern principles,
healing sickness, rescuing crises,
using drugs to dispel disease, benefiting life—
they earn renown for divine and skillful craft.
Yet true scripture-holders are not worldly physicians,
nor common healers, nor purveyors of coastal prescriptions.
Their golden needles move in silent measure—
they are the *Body of the Skilled Physician*.

They practice wondrous methods well:
human *qi* and temperament are mixed and varied—
some lose their balance at birth,
some bear visible ailments,
some bear invisible ailments,
some suffer bodily woes,
some suffer familial woes,
some suffer national woes,
some suffer age-long woes,
some suffer karmic woes across lifetimes.
Illness and suffering cling, endless in their cycle—
parents cannot instruct them,
sages cannot transform them,
laws cannot restrain them,
medicine cannot cure them,
salvation has no method.

Yet those who uphold this scripture act without deceit,
without forced intrusion—
their wondrous applications are fitting and true.
Their methods are sound, their teachings apt—
no bitter words, no harsh tones,
no defiance of the heart,
no burden to the body,
no forcing of the impossible,
no indulging in false compliance.
They practice wondrous methods to bring ease to all.

Thus, when the wondrous method is applied:
The deaf regain hearing;
Then the blind see clearly;
Then the mute speak;

「Then the lame rise and walk upright;
Then those long afflicted by chronic illness regain their vitality in an instant;
Then gray hair turns black, fallen teeth regrow;
Then the aged grow strong, the young grow mighty;
Then women conceive, and birds and beasts likewise bear offspring—whether born or unborn, all come to fruition;
Then the treasures of the earth are revealed, and gold and jade manifest in their forms;
Then withered bones revive, and all become living, complete persons.

It dispels all calamities, liberates all adversities.
Malevolent spirits and grudges of past lives never dare intrude or harm;
The nine ancestral ties and six kinsfolk—past, present, and future—
are untroubled, free from entanglement, their bonds dissolved in the void.

Abundance flourishes, the body grows light—
not merely lifting those burdened by grave illness,
but even preventing afflictions before they take form.
Truly, without medicine yet bringing joy,
it eternally preserves life to extend one’s years—
not a single remedy or technique,
but the Way’s own physician for all beings.

The Heavenly Physician is the best,
a compassionate father to all sentient beings;
wondrous methods in virtuous practice
bring ease to all who uphold them.

This scripture ascends to the **Great Dao of Reality** (*Zhēndào*), the **Marvelous Prescription for the Age** (*Shìshì qífāng*).
Every person inherently possesses it—
yet those who stray remain unaware.

Those who sincerely uphold this true scripture gain its rewards;
it is fitting to benefit the world.
Why, in this degenerate age, do selfish thoughts arise?
When one gains even a little,
yet does not extend compassion to all beings?
Like the fatness of Qin and the leanness of Yue,
they are unrelated—
at first, they do not teach the world,
but ultimately, they indulge their own desires.
Briefly enlightened, then obscured once more,
they cannot attain the Dao—
how lamentable!

Alas, to know the scripture yet not liberate the world—
that is wrong.
To falsely claim knowledge while arrogantly teaching others,
to recklessly transmit the Way—
that is an even greater sin.

If one can eliminate these two errors,
strive with earnest resolve to comprehend this scripture,
then universal liberation is possible.

**Continuation of the *Verified Signs* Section (28th Chapter):**
Those who uphold this scripture are called **Luminous Bodies** (*Guāngmíng shēn*), for they are constantly embraced and sustained by the **Heavenly Radiance** (*Dìguāng*).

Those who uphold this scripture
are not merely skilled physicians (*Liángyī shēn*), but **Luminous Bodies**.
Human nature is inherently pure and bright,
illuminating all without exception—
yet when the *qi* is constrained and obscured by worldly attachments,
its clarity grows dim, veiled by darkness.

For those who truly uphold this scripture,
their innate nature shines like the heavens,
their mind opens to boundless truth,
their light ever radiant,
their vital essence and essence refined—
as the **Great Void** (*Tàixū*) without clouds,
as the **radiance of sun and moon** in succession,
vast and overflowing,
profound and ever-flowing.
Truly, they are **Luminous Bodies** (*Guāngmíng shēn*), not stained by darkness.

They are constantly embraced and sustained by the **Heavenly Radiance** (*Dìguāng*).
The **Heavenly Sovereign** (*Dì*—the **Jade Emperor** *Yùdì*)’s radiance pervades all,
yet humans, being lowly and impure,
struggle to bear its weight.
Now, those who uphold this scripture
walk in the path of Heaven’s light,
illuminating the **Golden Court** (*Jīntíng*—the celestial realm),
and when the **Heavenly Radiance** (*Dìguāng*) is invoked,
the **Great Harmony** (*Tàihé*) reveals its brilliance.

The **Heavenly Radiance** (*Dìguāng*) enfolds them,
protecting those who uphold this scripture.
Those who uphold this scripture are transformed by its power,
eternally preserving their purity.
Their light intermingles with the **Heavenly Radiance**—
those who uphold this scripture,
in faith aligned with Heaven’s **virtue/power** (*Dé*),
share the **radiance of sun and moon**.

It has been said that the **Heavenly Dao** (*Tiāndào*) descends to benefit all,
its radiance without favor or partiality.
Humans receive Heaven’s bright decree,
inherently possessing **Great Radiance** (*Dà guāngmíng*).
Yet their nature is untainted by default,
their mind noble in its purity.
When humans indulge in avarice and pleasure,
they cannot keep the **Soul’s Platform** (*Língtái*—the mind’s pure essence) free of defilements—
like the sun and moon being eclipsed,
or clouds and mists obscuring the sky.

If one does not **refine their faults** (*Wén qíguò*—cultivate moral rectitude)
and **sever desire to return to principle** (*Jué yù huán lǐ*),
their momentary darkness swiftly clears,
opening to the **Four Directions and Eight Reaches** (*Sìtōng bādá*—all directions),
their brightness ever increasing.
There is no **Heavenly Radiance** that does not shine,
no **Heavenly Sovereign’s Light** that does not descend—
this is not so.

Humans, however, abandon themselves,
their thoughts restless and unceasing,
active by day, weary by night,
their minds never still.
Their deeds are false,
their thoughts impure,
contradicting Heaven’s will,
thus obscuring the **true scripture** (*Zhēnjīng*).

Even a slight awakening,
their faults become **karmic seeds** (*Yèshēng*—future consequences).
Guilt and retribution loom heavy,
their suffering never lightened.
If they do not swiftly amend,
using **eloquent refinement** (*Cí wén*—moral cultivation)
as their excuse,
Heaven cannot be deceived,
the gods cannot be fooled.
Humans’ self-perception
is like gazing upon their own lungs and liver—
this nature, where is it?
How can they bear to deceive their own hearts thus?

Therefore, the **Heavenly Decree** (*Tiānmìng*)’s blessings,
the **Heavenly Sovereign’s Light** (*Dìguāng xiánghù*—the Jade Emperor’s protection),
must belong to those who truly uphold this scripture
and cultivate the Dao to attain Reality (*Chéngzhēn*).

Those who truly uphold this scripture are **Luminous Bodies** (*Guāngmíng shēn*),
embracing the **Heavenly Radiance** (*Dìguāng*).
Alas, humans are all the same,
their **illuminated virtue** (*Míngdé*) equal—
yet why do they not all uphold this scripture,
fulfilling the Dao,
and aligning with the **Heavenly Sovereign’s intent** (*Dìxīn*)?

**Continuation of the *Verified Signs* Section (29th Chapter):**
Those who uphold this scripture are called **Bodies of Freedom** (*Zìzài shēn*), for they can freely traverse the **Heavenly Palaces and Marvelous Realms** (*Tiāngōng miàojìng*).

The virtues and merits of upholding this scripture
are beyond measure—
those who uphold it
are not merely **Luminous Bodies** (*Guāngmíng shēn*), but **Bodies of Freedom** (*Zìzài shēn*).
The **Three Calamities** (*Sānzāi*—fire, water, wind),
the **Four Slayings** (*Sìshā*—thieves, robbers, etc.),
the **Five Agents** (*Wǔxíng*—wood, fire, earth, metal, water),
the **Six Harms** (*Liùhài*—poison, weapons, etc.),
the **Seven Injuries** (*Qīshāng*—physical afflictions),
the **Eight Difficulties** (*Bānàn*—karmic hardships),
the **Nine Star Disasters** (*Jiǔxīng è*—celestial misfortunes),
and the **Ten Evil Karmas** (*Shì’ě yè*—ten transgressions)
all fail to entangle them—
their **karmic roots** (*Yègēn*) are forever severed.

They attain the **Three Elements** (*Sānyuán*—heaven, earth, human),
transcend the **Five Aggregates** (*Wǔyùn*—form, sensation, perception, etc.),
free from the **Four Marks** (*Sìxiàng*—impermanence, suffering, etc.),
severed from the **Hundred Non-Dharmas** (*Bǎi fēi*—unskillful deeds),
removed from the **Ten Thousand Phenomena** (*Wàn yǒu*—all worldly attachments),
surpassing the **loads of kalpas** (*Zàijié*—aeons of suffering),
truly attaining the **Great Freedom** (*Dà zìzài*—absolute liberation).

They traverse the **Heavenly Palaces and Marvelous Realms** (*Tiāngōng miàojìng*) by divine power.
These upholders of the scripture
possess **profound, effortless skill** (*Xuán gōng rúyì*—mystical, intuitive mastery),
their bodies attaining **Freedom** (*Zìzài*).

All the **Heavenly Palaces** (*Fánzhū tiāngōng*—various celestial realms),
all the **Marvelous Realms** (*Yīqiè miàojìng*—divine landscapes),
with **jade paths and gemstone steps** (*Bìlù yáo jiē*),
**twisted walls and painted barriers** (*Qiú qiáng cǎi bì*),
**the Jade Capital and Golden Gates** (*Yùjīng jīn què*—celestial city),
**the Purple Palace and Yellow Rooms** (*Zǐfǔ huáng fáng*—imperial abodes),
**palaces of jade and halls of pearl** (*Qióng lóu yùyǔ*),
**the Enchanted Gardens and Gemstone Pools** (*Wèn yuàn yáo chí*),
**the Mystic Heights and Secluded Platforms** (*Xuán dōu shàng jìng*—upper celestial realms),
**the Secret Halls and Red Pillars** (*Mì yuàn dān tái*—hidden sanctums),
**the Fragrant Forest and Sacred Paths** (*Bǎolín xiāng jìng*),
**the Divine Chambers and Vermilion Offices** (*Shénshì jiàng guān*),
**the Law-Bridge with Brocade Railings** (*Fǎ qiáo jǐn kǎn*),
**the White Hall and Rust-Colored Courtyard** (*Hàodiàn zhě tíng*),
as well as **jade grasses and rare flowers** (*Yáo cǎo qí huā*),
**ice peaches and snow plums** (*Bīng táo xuě lǐ*),
**fiery dates and flame-red jujubes** (*Huǒ zǎo huǒ zǎo*),
**nectar and ambrosia** (*Dān zhuàn qióng jiāng*),
**the Dao’s radiance and divine blessings** (*Dàoguāng xuán ruì*),
**rainbow clouds and celestial omens** (*Cǎi xiá yún xiāng*),
**divine carriages and lawful conveyances** (*Shén yú fǎ jià*),
**lawful treasures and heavenly beings** (*Fǎbǎo tiān rén*),
**all manner of wondrous essences** (*Zhū pǐn qí yīng*—rare, extraordinary substances),
**divine traversal and meditative observation** (*Shén yóu dìng guān*—spiritual wandering and insight),
all are explored in their triumphant journeys—
unattainable by ordinary mortals.

The virtues and merits of upholding this scripture
are beyond measure—
how much more so when its benefits
extend to all beings, both subtle and manifest,
alive and departed,
past and present?
Evil spirits are subdued,
the **Heavenly Radiance** descends,
divine wanderings through the heavens
are still but a fraction of its wonders—
then how boundless are its virtues and merits!」

「Speaking of the **Sage of Utmost Perfection** (*Shuō jīng zhì shèng yòu hé rú zāi*),
Ah! The **scripture’s virtues** are indeed the greatest.
It must be upheld with **unshaken sincerity** (*dāng zhì chéng yǒng chí*).

The **Application and Verification Chapter** continues with thirty-one sections.
If **Daoists or those of noble resolve** (*dào shì zhì rén*)—
those who can **establish an altar** (*néng jié tán*) and **recite the scripture** (*sòng jīng*),
wearing **new and pure garments** (*zhuó xīn jìng yī*),
at the **midnight hour** (*yè bàn*), when the **dark and silent** (*fěi yě jì*) **true form** (*zì zhēn xíng*) of the **sacred syllables** (*yún xiāng*) is invoked,
sitting alone in a **chamber of purity** (*qīng jìng shì*),
**rinsing the mouth and brushing the teeth nine times** (*kòu chǐ jiǔ tōng*),
facing east in **proper posture** (*duān zuò*),
reciting and chanting this scripture—
then, at that very moment,
**Heavenly Purity** (*tiān zhēn*) **descends upon the desk** (*yù jī*),
**Jade Consorts** (*yù fēi*) **sweep the ceremonial mat** (*fú yán*),
**ten thousand spirits** (*wàn shén*) **assemble in ranks** (*bān liè*),
**all the celestial realms** (*zhū tiān*) **come to the hall** (*lín xuān*),
**the Three Realms** (*sān jiè*) **stand in attendance** (*shì wèi*),
and the **Five Emperors** (*wǔ dì*) **oversee the reception** (*sī yíng*).
Those who uphold this scripture are called the **Twelve-Merit Body** (*shí'èr gōng dé shēn*),
and their **compassionate salvation** (*cí jì*) is boundless.

Again, of **Daoists or those of noble resolve** (*dào shì zhì rén*):
**Daoists** (*dào shì*), a common term for those who **pursue the Way** (*xiū dào rù xuán zhī tōng míng*).
**Noble resolve** (*zhì rén*), those with **determination** (*yǒu zhì zhī rén*).
Some mistakenly render it as **Sages of Perfection** (*zhì rén*—*fēi yě*), for only those who **attain the Dao and become True** (*dé dào chéng zhēn*) may be called such.
Those who study the scripture merely see the **Heavenly Purity** (*tiān zhēn*), **Jade Consorts**, **ten thousand spirits**, and **celestial realms**,
along with the **Three Realms** and **Five Emperors** descending and attending,
and thus assume it pertains to **Sages of Perfection** (*zhì rén*).
But they do not know that this scripture is the **Imperial Edict** (*dì chì*—*mì shì*),
and wherever it is, all spirits **offer reverence and guard** (*gòng fèng*).
When it encounters those who **recite and uphold** (*chí sòng*) it—
whether they be **foolish husbands or common wives** (*yú fū fán fù*), **infirm elders or ignorant children** (*shuāi sǒu méng tóng*)—
the spirits **respect such persons** (*shén jìng shì rén*) as if they were **receiving this Edict** (*rú fèng shì dì*).
If one **upholds the scripture with sincerity and reverence** (*chí jīng chéng jìng*), their **blessings and virtues** (*fú dé*) are boundless.
But **neglect or disrespect** (*dài màn zé jiù yāng lì zhì*) will bring **immediate retribution** (*jiù yāng*).
The spirits attend and guard because they **revere those who uphold the true scripture** (*jìng qí chí zhēn jīng*), not necessarily **Sages of Perfection** (*zhì rén*).
How much more so when they **establish the Dao-altar** (*jié dào fǎ*), **recite in the hall** (*chǎng fǔn sòng jīng*),
and wear **new and pure robes** (*zhuó xīn zuò jié qìng yī fú*)?
At the **midnight hour** (*yè bàn*), in the **silent and pure chamber** (*jìng shì zhī zhōng*),
when the **sacred syllables** (*yún xiāng*—*gǔ qú*) are **uttered in profound obscurity** (*dà mèi shí yě jì*),
sitting alone, **rinsing the mouth and brushing the teeth nine times** (*kòu chǐ jiǔ tōng*),
facing east, **upright in body and mind** (*duān shēn dìng zuò*),
reciting and chanting this scripture—
then, at that very moment,
when these **noble resolvers** (*zhì rén*) **follow the method in purity** (*rú fǎ qīng jìng sòng jīng*),
**Heavenly Purity** (*tiān zhēn*) **descends upon the desk** (*yù jī*), and **Celestial Truths** (*zhū tiān zhī zhēn*) **come to the hall** (*lín xuān*),
**Jade Consorts and Spirit Maidens** (*líng fēi yù nǚ*) **sweep the ceremonial mat of the Dao** (*fú qīng fǎ yán*).
*Sweep* (*fú*) here means to **purify with solemn reverence** (*dǎng yě*), not to **contradict or oppose** (*fú nì*).
*The ceremonial mat* (*yán*) is the **mat of the Dao** (*fǎ shì*).
**Ten thousand spirits** (*wàn shén*) **assemble in ranks** (*bān liè*), as **imperial officials** (*qún chén*) do under the **edicts of mortal emperors** (*shì jiān dì wáng chì lìng*).
The **Primordial Scriptures** (*huáng jīng*) are the **secrets of the Jade Emperor** (*yù dì mì yán*), the **original intent of the First Beginning** (*yuán shǐ fǎ zhǐ*).
When the **noble resolvers** (*zhì rén*) **recite and uphold** (*chí sòng*), they **proclaim the Imperial Edict** (*dú xuān dì chì*) as it were,
and **all spirits** (*wàn shén*) **assemble in ranks and bow in reverence** (*suí biàn gǒng fèng*).
**All the celestial realms** (*zhū tiān*) **come to the hall** (*lín xuān*), with their **imperial truths and sacred conveyances** (*dì zhēn fǎ jià*).
*The hall* (*xuān*) is the **mat of the Dao** (*xuán àn*).
**The Three Realms** (*sān jiè*)—**the Heavenly Realm, Earthly Realm, and Watery Abode** (*tiān jiè, dì jiè, shuǐ fǔ jiè*)—
**deploy their divine attendants and historians** (*shén jiāng shì liè hù wèi*).
Or it may be said that **the Three Realms** (*sān jiè*)—**desire, form, and formlessness** (*yù, sè, wú sè*)—
are not the case here.
**The Five Emperors** (*wǔ dì*)—**the Five Directions, Five Spirits, and Five Elders of the Celestial Court** (*wǔ fāng wǔ líng wǔ lǎo dì*)—
**oversee the reception** (*sī yíng*).
Or it may be said that **the Five Emperors** (*wǔ dì*) are the **Five Sacred Mountains** (*wǔ yuè zūn dì*).
Since earlier there is mention of **ten thousand spirits** (*wàn shén*) and **Three Realms** (*sān jiè*), and within the Three Realms are the **Five Elders** (*wǔ lǎo*),
this must refer to the **Five Sacred Mountains and ten thousand spirits** (*wǔ yuè wàn shén*).
The Three Realms include the **Five Sacred Mountains** (*sān jiè zhōng yǒu wǔ yuè*), hence the **Five Elders** (*wǔ lǎo*).
In the scripture, the **Five Elders** (*wǔ lǎo*) **begin the questioning** (*qǐ wèn*), so when the scripture is opened,
the **Five Elders** (*wǔ lǎo*) **oversee the reception** (*sī yíng*) of the **Dao Ancestor** (*dào zǔ*).
*Oversee* (*sī*) means **to take charge** (*zhǔ yě*), **to accept** (*chéng yě*).
*Reception* (*yíng*) means **to meet and escort** (*qì yě*).
It signifies **the ritual homage to the Mysterious Sovereign** (*guì lǐ xū huáng zhī yì*).
Or it may also be said that *oversee the reception* (*sī yíng*) refers to **the spirits of the scripture ascending to the Dao’s obscurity** (*chí jīng zhī shén shēng xuán*).
But if one does not **recite the scripture with utmost devotion** (*qián*), the spirits will not **fully manifest their protection** (*bèi hù*).
The spirits **discern and respond** (*jiàn bào*), and this is inevitable.
Those who **see or hear** (*jiàn wén*) the scripture must **solemnly uphold it with reverence** (*lǐn rán gōng chí*).
Those who do not must **urgently seek to encounter it** (*dàn wéi wén qí yíng*).
To be **strict as if the spirits themselves are present** (*yán rú zhū shén zhī lín*), yet **not to seek their visible effects** (*bù qiú yìng jiàn zhī xiào*).
To **hold fast to the true scripture without thought or action** (*wú sī wú wéi, mì mì chí zhēn*),
so that the **spirit of one’s own body** (*yī shēn zhī shén*) **stands vigilant and eternally safeguards the Dao’s true scripture** (*sēn rán yǒng bǎo xuán zhēn jīng*).
Exhort them not to be negligent.

The **Application and Verification Chapter** continues with thirty-one sections.
Again, those who can **close their eyes and sit in still meditation** (*bì mù jìng sī*),
**retain and visualize this scripture** (*cún xiǎng shì jīng*),
unaware that their **body is enveloped in the Three Colors of Cloud-Qi** (*sān sè yún qì zhī zhōng*),
suddenly see their **form radiant and resplendent** (*shēn guāng míng hè yì*), ascending to the **Celestial Palaces** (*shàng shēng tiān gōng*).
**Multitudes of True Ones** (*zhōng zhēn*) **descend to greet them** (*xiāng xià yíng*).
Whatever they **request in their hearts** (*xīn yǒu suǒ qǐng*), all is **answered and granted** (*yīng fèng*).
**Immortal elixirs and wondrous treasures** (*xiān dān miào bǎo*) are **obtained at will** (*suí yì zì dé*).
It is fitting to **follow the prescribed methods** (*yīng dāng yī kē*) and **devoutly practice in silent mindfulness** (*míng xīn fèng xíng*).
Not only must one **devoutly recite** (*qián sòng*) this scripture and **gain the spirits’ protection** (*dé zhū shén hù*),
but also, when **closing their eyes in still meditation** (*bì mù jìng zuò*),
they may **subdue the Five Aggregates’ harm** (*sǐng xiǎng wǔ yùn zhī hài*), with **form** (*sè*) being the foremost.
The **disorder of form** (*sè zhī luàn xīn*) is **realized through the eyes** (*mù shí zhī*).
To **uphold the true scripture** (*fèng chí zhēn jīng*), one’s **body and mind must be harmonious** (*shēn xīn yí*).
To **close the eyes and attain stillness** (*bì mù yǐ jìng*), the **heart naturally enters Great Tranquility** (*xīn zì dà dìng*).
Yet the **Dao’s profound subtlety** (*dào zhī xuán wēi*) cannot be **grasped without contemplation** (*fēi sī bù rù*).
**Random thoughts** (*wàng sī*) only **disturb the True** (*yòu suǒ luàn zhēn*).
To **close the eyes and sit in still meditation** (*bì mù jìng zuò*), not **seeing what is desirable** (*bù jiàn kě yú*),
so that the **heart does not stray** (*xīn bù luàn*), to **remain silent and ponder** (*mò hē sī suǒ*),
**delving into the profound mysteries** (*mì rù shēn jī*—*dào zhī dà yào yě*).
Now, for those who **sit in still meditation with closed eyes** (*jìng zuò zhě*), it is said that **the eyelids should be half-lowered** (*liǎng mù bàn chuí lián*), not fully closed,
lest they engage in **ghostly schemes and occult practices** (*wèi zuò guǐ kuàng huó jì*—*bù zhī yīn qù zá niàn, shì yuē guǐ kuàng*).
If the **heart is pure** (*xīn qīng jìng*), what harm is there in **closing the eyes** (*bì mù*)?
The **common folk’s hearts are not resolute** (*shí rén xīn bù jué liè*), so they **hesitate when closing their eyes** (*bì mù yí shēng*).
Thus, they **half-open their eyes** (*bàn kāi yǎn*), lest they **fall into slumber or doubt** (*bù zhuó shuì mó yí shēng*).
If one **forgets both good and evil** (*shàn è liǎng wàng*), **holds neither being nor non-being** (*wú wú yě wú*), the **True Dao enters naturally** (*zhēn dào zì rù*).
What hindrance is there in **closing the eyes** (*bì mù*)?
The **half-lowered eyelids** (*chuí lián zhī lùn*) are merely a **precaution of the Mysterious Masters** (*xuán shī fáng wú zhì rén mó huò*).
Moreover, the **meaning of half-lowered eyelids** (*chuí lián zhī yì*) is to **not observe outwardly** (*bì mù bù guān*),
while **innerly possessing true illumination** (*nèi yǒu zhēn zhào*).
The **heart’s law is ever-awake** (*xīn fǎ xīng xīng*), **radiant and unobscured** (*guāng míng bù mèi*).
Like **lowering the curtain to attend to governance** (*rú chuí lián tīng zhèng*), though one does not **look upon the matters** (*bù guān guān kàn*),
those who **should respond** (*dāng yìng zhě*) are **without fail known** (*wú bù zhī qí*).
This is the **mechanism of Dao cultivation** (*gū jiā*), hence its inclusion in the discussion of the scripture.

The **cultivation of visualization** (*cún xiǎng*) is the scripture itself. Yet this visualization is not the summoning of visions or effects as in the *Zhāoshè Jīng* (Scripture of Summoning and Gathering). When practicing this method, one should revere the Jade Emperor as if seeing him in person, pondering the Dao and seeking the True—never lightly or carelessly.

Mere recitation of the scripture with a distracted mind is insufficient. One must **quietly preserve this heart**, delving deeply into its profound truths. When embodied in body and mind, the saying *"visualization is the scripture"* holds true—unaware, one finds oneself immersed in the **three-colored qi-clouds** (*sān sè yún qì*). These clouds arise from the **steaming of Heaven and Earth**.

When the mind is deeply settled in the scripture, it merges with the **Heavenly Heart** (*tiān xīn*), and with each sincere thought, the **auspicious clouds** (*qìng yún*) emerge—unaware, one is enveloped in the **three-colored qi-clouds of green, yellow, and white**. When the mind and body are still and upright, the **Dragon and Tiger coil and spiral** (*lóng hǔ pán xuán*), giving rise to these three-colored clouds.

If one attains True Perfection, then **five-colored clouds** (*wǔ sè yún*) gather, and the **nine radiant glories** (*jiǔ xiá guāng*) spread forth—this is yet another state.

Suddenly (*rú*), in the blink of an eye (*shǎo qīng shí*), one’s body shines **radiantly resplendent** (*guāng míng hè yì*), ascending to the **Celestial Palace** (*tiān gōng*), where the **multitudes of True Ones** descend to welcome.

**Suddenly**, in a short while, one’s body **glows brilliantly** (*shēn guāng huàn fā*), **magnificent and luminous** (*shèng yào bǐng yì*). As previously explained.

When the heart has a request, when the mind seeks entry into the **Celestial Palace**, all **supreme elixirs and wondrous treasures** (*yuánshǐ yùdì xiāndān miàobǎo*) are **offered in response**—whatever is desired is naturally obtained.

One must not merely **seek treasures**; the treasures are **offered to oneself**. One should **follow the prescribed methods** (*yī kē*), as previously explained.

The scripture is the **true nature of human essence** (*rén xìng zhēn*). Silent enlightenment and steadfast practice suffice.

Speaking of visualization, it seems to fall under the **second meaning** (*dì èr yì*). The Confucian classics say:
*"Faintly perceived, yet unseen—like a form without substance, yet clearly visible. It is as if one stands upon it."*

Is this not also the **second meaning**?

Alas, **enlightened sages are few**, while **mediocre minds prevail**. If one does not **grasp visualization**, how can one seek the **unheard teachings** (*bù wén zhī shì*) and thus **harmonize with Heaven and humanity**, transcend the mundane, and enter the sacred?

Let scholars ponder this.

---
**Continuation of the *Yìngyàn Pǐn* (Verification Chapter), Thirty-Second Section**

This scripture is the path by which **three-world Golden Immortals** (*sān shì jīn xiān*) and **ten-direction Great Saints** (*shí fāng dà shèng*) attain the **supreme wondrous Dao**. The **Jade Emperor** of this scripture is the **teacher of all heavens** and the **king of all saints**.

This scripture is not merely for those who recite it with devotion—even **three-world Golden Immortals**, whether of the past, present, or future worlds, must follow its methods to attain the **supreme wondrous Dao**.

**Golden Immortals** (*jīn xiān*) are those whose **Golden Elixirs do not decay** (*jīn dān bù huǐ*), the **true Daoists of the Great Mysterious** (*tài xuán zhēn xiān*). The **ten-direction Great Saints**—those of the **four cardinal, four diagonal, and upper-lower directions** (*sì zhèng fāng, sì yú fāng, shàng xià fāng*)—the **ten-direction numinous treasures and divine spirits** (*shí fāng língbǎo zūnshén*), the **Great Saints of Ultimate Truth and Boundless Extremes** (*zhì zhēn wújí dà shèng*)—all attain the **supreme wondrous Dao** by following its methods, as previously explained.

Progress in cultivation varies, and attainments differ. Those whose **Dao-verification stages** (*zhèngdào jiē pǐn*) have not yet been reached do not yet possess the **supreme**.

Whether **gods, humans, earthly, or ghostly immortals**; whether **desire-realm, form-realm, or formless heavenly deities**; whether **Bodhisattvas, Śrāvakas, Arhats, or Buddhist vehicles**; whether **transformed, great, beautiful, faithful, virtuous persons, or Confucian sages**—none of these are the **ultimate**.

Only **Celestial Immortals** (*tiān xiān*), **Wen Buddhas** (*wén fó*), and **unknowable Saints** (*bù zhī shèng*)—where **gods and Confucians** are named the **highest**—do the Golden Immortals and Great Saints, by **faithfully following this scripture**, merge with the **Imperial True Ones** (*dì zhēn*), thus attaining the **highest Immortal**, transcending and verifying the **supreme, ultimate, and wondrous Dao**, beyond the fruits of **heavenly blessings and virtues**.

This is the **Jade Emperor**. *Zhī* means *"this."* He is the **teacher of all heavens**—the **thirty-three heavens**, the **thirty-six heavens**, the **twelve thousand heavens**, the **three thousand great worlds**, and **all heavens**—who **transform and give rise to the multitudes of True Ones** through the *Huáng Jīng* (Imperial Scripture).

He is the **king of all saints**—whether **immortals, Confucian sages, Buddhas, heavenly beings, or gods**—all **yield their virtues**, **surrender their merits**, and **acknowledge their supremacy**, revering him through the ages.

Alas, if a person’s **Heavenly Sovereign** (*tiān jūn*) remains **serene and composed**, then the Dao may be attained. If one does not **cultivate the mind to enlightenment**, merging with Heaven in virtue, and **venerating the Supreme in emptiness**, one has **fallen short**. Be warned and reflect.

**Continuation of the *Yìngyàn Pǐn*, Thirty-Third Section**

Thus, when an **ordinary person** (*fán fú*) encounters this scripture and **devotes themselves with single-minded devotion**, even the **Five Emperors** (*wǔ dì*) will **assist and shelter**, summoning **multitudes of immortals**, commanding **divine officials**, directing **yin-yang forces**, earning the **respect of ten thousand spirits**, subduing **myriad gods**, keeping **a hundred evils at bay**, and binding **all demons** in form.

After death, one will **enter the Southern Palace for refinement**, ascending the **Upper Clarity** (*shàng qīng*) with **free and easy steps**, dwelling in **adaptability and eternal Dao**.

It is not only **Golden Immortals and Great Sages** who verify the Dao through this scripture.

Thus, when an **ordinary person** (*shìjiān fán fú*) encounters this scripture through **karmic opportunity**, and **devotes themselves with precision and sincerity**, even the **Five Elder Emperors** (*wǔ lǎo dìshì*—not the Five Peaks) will **aid their cultivation** and **supplement their deficiencies**. They will **summon immortals** and **command divine officials**—**issuing orders to make them act**, as immortals respond to command, and **controlling them to serve**, as divine officials obey.

The scripture states:
*"Those who cultivate the Dao with devotion can even command ghosts and subdue gods."*

Even an ordinary person, through **single-minded devotion to the scripture**, wielding the **power of Dao-law**, can **summon immortals and command gods**, directing **yin-yang forces**. Only through **precision and unity** can one **govern transformation** and **guide yin-yang**.

The **ten thousand spirits** will **reverently bow in awe**, and the **myriad gods** will **submit in fear and servitude**—without need for ritual. The **a hundred evils** will **avoid the path**, and the **multitudes of demons** will **restrain their forms**, daring not to reveal themselves.

After death, one’s spirit perceives what was unseen before.

One is then admitted to the **Southern Palace** for **refinement**—the **Southern Palace**, the Vermilion Refinement Bureau, where souls are measured and spirits are tempered. Having undergone **refinement**, one ascends to the **Upper Purity** realm, taking **divine strides** to reach the **Upper Purity** heavens—this is not the true Upper Purity domain, but merely the expression of ascending to heaven.

Freed to wander at will, one avoids the **Six Realms of Torment**, escapes the consequences of **karma**, and is bound by no constraints—moving effortlessly and at ease.

With the Dao, one endures eternally. Though initially not yet perfect, if one devotes oneself **single-mindedly** to the scripture, aligning one’s heart with the Dao, free from obstruction and entanglement, the spirit and soul become pure and undefiled, never again to perish or fall—thus enduring with the Dao.

This is what the **Daoist classics** mean by *"dying yet not perishing"* and what the **Buddhist scriptures** mean by *"enlightenment brings instant release."*

Even the most humble practitioner, through **single-minded devotion** to the scripture, achieves such results—then it is known how profound the **power of utmost sincerity** is.

Though of low understanding, one can still fully attain the Dao. Let the reader strive accordingly.

**Chapter 34: Manifestations of Response**
Moreover, when common folk in the world hear this scripture and their hearts yearn in reverence, they can, within their households, choose a pure and serene place, draw an image of the **Imperial Sage**, and with **earnest devotion**, offer incense morning and night—abundant **sacred flowers, lamps, and fruits**, honoring and nourishing the sacred form, chanting the **holy name**, and bowing in worship while reciting the scripture. Such a person shall attain **thirty kinds of supreme, wondrous virtues**:

1. The **ten thousand immortals** shall hold them in high esteem,
2. The **departed ancestors** shall be reborn in heaven,
3. Past **sufferings and calamities** shall be resolved and released,
4. All paths they tread shall be **smooth and open**.

「The remaining twenty kinds of supreme, wondrous virtues**:

5. They shall be free from theft and banditry,
6. All their desires shall be fulfilled,
7. They shall be delivered from water and fire calamities,
8. All misfortunes and adversities shall be subtly dispelled,
9. Their nightly dreams shall be auspicious and fortunate,
10. Illnesses and diseases shall not afflict them,
11. Their wisdom and intelligence shall be acute and clear,
12. All who see them shall rejoice,
13. Their clothing and food shall be abundant and flourishing,
14. Their descendants shall be honored and noble—*not merely wealthy and opulent, but virtuous and refined, free from ignoble or untimely misfortune*,
15. Their six kinsfolk shall take joy in them,
16. Their household and lineage shall dwell in harmony,
17. They shall be freed from the three kinds of evil retribution,
18. They shall be transformed from female to male,
19. Their appearance and bearing shall be dignified and awe-inspiring,
20. They shall become great ministers of the realm,
21. They shall be born as the sons of emperors,
22. Ghosts and spirits shall hold them in reverence and awe,
23. They shall attain the **Dharma of Retention**—*all past karma shall be exhausted, and their life-force shall flow unimpeded*,
24. All gods shall protect and honor those who uphold this scripture and revere the **Imperial Sage**,
25. Their nine lineages shall be sheltered—*the nine lineages being: the paternal great-grandfather, paternal grandfather, paternal ancestor, father, oneself, son, grandson, great-grandson, and remote descendant; or alternatively, the three generations of the father, the three generations of the mother, and the three generations of the wife*,
26. They shall live long in this world,
27. All sentient beings in the world shall rely upon their virtuous deeds,
28. The **Mara-kings** shall commend and welcome them,
29. They shall ascend beyond the realms of desire, form, and formlessness,
30. They shall ascend in broad daylight—*though the transformations of the immortals vary, this does not necessarily mean ascending in the flesh during daylight; rather, their essence harmonizes with the **Great Void** and their spirit roams the **Celestial Capital** of the Imperial Sage*.

To uphold this scripture with reverence and honor the **Imperial Sage**, though these virtues may be attained, one must first utterly abandon all secret lusts, seek no verification of their efficacy, nor cease their practice. With their heart aligned with the **Heavenly Dao**, only then shall they bear fruit—even if no fruit is borne, it shall not diminish their merit in doing good.

If one seeks only these effects, they are not truly transmitting the **Imperial Sage’s scripture**. May the observant heed this warning.

**Continuation of Chapter 35: Manifestations of Response**
At that time, the **Celestial Sage** further instructed the **Four Assemblies**, saying:

“The virtues of this scripture are such that it can shatter the **Yin Mountains** and the **Iron Encircled Mountains**, drain the waters of the **Sea of Suffering**, dispel the **Great Underworld Prison**, extract all beings from sin and torment, subdue violent and malevolent **Mara-demons**, and safeguard all lands.

It can extinguish all malevolent ghosts, banish all evil spirits and dark realms, and eliminate all grave illnesses. It can dissolve all malevolent poisons, sever ties with all wicked people—*either by preventing encounter or causing such persons to flee upon seeing them*—and tame all venomous beasts. Moreover, those who practice **Daoist refinement** shall transmute their **Yin-qi** into poisonous dragons, fierce beasts, and great serpents, each numbering in the hundreds of billions, all protecting this **true scripture** and ensuring their own subjugation, forever shielding it.

The remaining virtues are too numerous to recount exhaustively.

To uphold this scripture and honor the **Imperial Sage** yields thirty kinds of virtue.

At that time, the **Celestial Sage** further instructed the **Four Assemblies**, saying:

“The virtues of this scripture are such that it can shatter the **Yin Mountains** and the **Iron Encircled Mountains**, purifying all lingering dust.

It can drain the **Sea of Suffering**, turning heads toward the shore and leaving its waves dry. It can dispel the **Great Underworld Prison**, silencing all false attachments. It can extract beings from all sin and torment, severing the roots of karma and preventing any future retribution. It can subdue violent and malevolent **Mara-demons**, restraining their arrogance and perverse delusions. It can safeguard all lands, ensuring prosperity and peace, wealth for the realm, and security for its people.

It can extinguish all malevolent ghosts, banishing all malevolent and dark spirits, and severing ties with dark, evil destinies. It can eliminate all grave illnesses, cleansing all afflictions. It can dissolve all malevolent poisons, removing all worldly malevolence and the **great true poison** of the body. It can sever ties with all wicked people—*either by preventing encounter or causing such persons to flee upon seeing them*—and tame all venomous beasts.

Moreover, those who practice **Daoist refinement** shall transmute their **Yin-qi** into poisonous dragons, fierce beasts, and great serpents, numbering in the hundreds of billions, all protecting this **true scripture** and ensuring their own subjugation, forever shielding it.»

It can crush all heretical Dao/Way, shatter all worldly heresies, and destroy one’s own deluded, false attachments.

All the celestial beings—all the heavens and their realms—
shall naturally hold this scripture in reverence, spontaneously honoring it.

As for its remaining virtues, they are beyond exhaustive description—refer to what has been said before.

This scripture’s virtues dissolve what is difficult to dispel and remove what is difficult to eradicate. It transforms all things without exception, benefiting all without fail. It is the **great expedient means**, the **supreme Dharma category**.

Though it is the subtle speech of the most exalted sages, it is the very essence of what can be accomplished.

Strive earnestly, and the merit shall naturally manifest.

**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Manifestation of Verification (Continuation)**

At that time, the gathered Daoist assembly, the Golden Immortal Bodhisattvas, and the retinues of the True Saints, upon hearing this, rejoiced and leapt in exultation. They bowed in reverence and composed a hymn:

*"Great is the Ultimate Dao/Way,
Without origin, the Most High True One.
It ascends to elevate all heavens,
Descends to rescue the lost souls.
It has no teacher or ancestor—
The Dao/Way itself is the body.
In the Dan Platform and Purple Mansion,
At the Golden Gate and Jade Capital,
This wondrous law is hidden,
Bestowing universal blessings upon all living beings.
It eradicates my ten thousand sins,
And extends my boundless years.
Ten thousand spirits pay homage,
While the demon kings guard and welcome.
Its virtues flourish boundlessly,
Recorded in the Yellow Register of names,
Vast across countless eons,
Ensuring my eternal existence."*

Then the assembled Daoist congregation, having finished their hymn, bowed and took refuge. They paid respects and withdrew.

At that time, the Daoist assembly—
*The Daoist assembly, where the Dao/Way is expounded*—
the Golden Immortal Bodhisattvas and the retinues of the True Saints, upon hearing this, having finished the scripture, rejoiced and leapt in exultation, their joy overflowing like drums and dances. They bowed in reverence and composed a hymn:

*"Great is the Ultimate Dao/Way,
Immeasurable, unattainable.
Without origin, without beginning,
The Most High True One.
It ascends to elevate all heavens,
Transforming all above.
It descends to rescue the lost souls,
Penetrating the depths of the underworld,
Freeing all stagnant spirits to ascend.
It has no teacher, no ancestor.
The Dao/Way itself is the body—
Praising this scripture, the Dao/Way is the essence.
In the Dan Platform and Purple Mansion,
The supreme mysterious realm.
At the Golden Gate and Jade Capital—
As previously explained—
This wondrous law is hidden—
Hidden, as in treasured away—
Bestowing universal blessings upon all living beings,
Or with blessings as universal as the *Pu* degree.
It eradicates my ten thousand sins,
The scripture can annihilate all offenses.
It extends my boundless years,
The scripture can prolong life.
Ten thousand spirits pay homage,
Revering this scripture.
The demon kings guard and welcome those who hold the scripture.
Its virtues flourish boundlessly,
Its virtues are vast and everlasting.
Recorded in the Yellow Register—
The *Xuandu* Immortal Ledger, inscribed on golden tablets and yellow talismans—
Vast across countless eons,
Boundless and remote, spanning countless eons.
Ensuring my eternal existence,
Ensuring those who hold the Dao/Way and this scripture shall endure forever."*

Then the gathered True Saints of the Daoist assembly, having finished their hymn, bowed and took refuge in the *Supreme Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct and Assembly Scripture*. They paid respects to the Most High Sage and withdrew.
