*Ren* (Humaneness) – Humaneness Between Ruler and Minister

Confucius said: "How great was Yao as a ruler! Towering indeed! Only Heaven is great, and only Yao took it as his model. Boundless indeed! The people could find no name for him."

The record states: Yao as a ruler was the guiding principle for all ages. The Master’s discourse is the eternal standard for ten thousand generations. "How great" signifies a name that cannot be surpassed, a meaning that cannot be exhausted. "Heaven" refers to the virtue of benevolence that covers and pities all below. "The king" refers to one who embodies benevolence and nurtures the people. The Way of benevolence is supremely great, identical in substance to Heaven, and the sage takes Heaven as his model. If one truly takes Heaven as one’s model, then one delights in every person and encompasses every thing—yet this may be described in words. If it can be described in words, then it must have limits and obstructions, and cannot be called "great." Thus, only Heaven is great: its entire being is ceaseless, and its position above is such that none can know its height or depth. This is why it is said: "This is how Heaven is Heaven." Only Yao is great: his virtue matches the boundless, and his emulation of Heaven is such that none can fathom its limits. This is why it is said: "This is how Yao is Yao." The Master’s lofty words reveal that one who rules must always possess a heart that embraces and broadly covers all without exception, and only then can one achieve a work of vastness, depth, height, and brilliance, enduring without limit. Thus one does not betray Heaven, does not fall short of Yao, and does not disgrace the Master’s discourse. Therefore, this record begins by elucidating this.

The *Outer Records* state: Yao set his heart upon the world and directed his will toward the destitute. If one person starved, he said, "It is I who have starved him"; if one person froze, he said, "It is I who have frozen him"; if one person committed a crime, he said, "It is I who have led him astray." The hundred clans bore him as the sun and moon, cherished him as father and mother. His benevolence shone forth, his righteousness was established, his virtue was vast, and his transformation was far-reaching. Thus, though he did not reward, the people were encouraged; though he did not punish, the people were governed.

The record states: This is what is meant by "Yao’s benevolence was like Heaven." Now, Heaven is towering indeed, but if one seeks its essence, it is utterly empty—what use is Heaven? Now, Yao is boundless indeed, but if one seeks his essence and finds even one person left unprotected, then it is but an empty name—what use is Yao? This record fears that one may neglect practical affairs, pursue only the lofty and distant, and claim, "Yao is here." Alas, how remote!

The *Canon of Yao* states: "He was able to make his lofty virtue illustrious, thereby bringing harmony to the nine clans. When the nine clans were harmonious, he distinguished and illuminated the hundred clans. When the hundred clans were illustrious, he harmonized the myriad states, and the black-haired people were transformed and became concordant."

The record states: The Master’s praise of Yao as "towering" and the historian’s praise of Yao as "lofty virtue" both signify that which cannot be surpassed. Yet this was achieved not by transcendent feats beyond reach, but by bringing harmony to the nine clans and distinguishing the hundred clans. This is precisely what is meant by calling him "Fangxun."

The *Liezi* states: After Yao had ruled the world for fifty years, he traveled to the broad thoroughfares and heard children singing: "He established us as the people, and none failed to reach his utmost. Unknowing and unperceiving, we follow the patterns of the Lord." There was also an old man, chewing and drumming his belly, striking the clods and singing: "When the sun rises, I work; when the sun sets, I rest. I dig a well to drink, till the fields to eat—what has the Emperor’s power to do with me?"

The record states: This is how "the black-haired people were transformed and became concordant." The children were innocent, the old man was senile—how could they know what was meant by the "patterns of the Lord"? Yet in that flourishing age of antiquity, even the most ignorant men and women were as close as family, their virtue permeating their skin and marrow, so deeply ingrained that they did not realize their words were thus. The Three Dynasties henceforth gathered the songs of the lanes and alleys, established them as fixed standards, listed them among the music officials, set them to pipes and strings, and observed them as customs.

The *Odes* of Zhou says: "The people are simple, daily using food and drink. The masses of the black-haired people all become your virtue." This expresses the same idea.

By the time of Qin, the court treated the black-haired people as fools, and thus the constraints have persisted to this day. How lamentable!

Confucius said: "He who governs by non-action—was this not Shun?" What did he do? He merely maintained reverence and faced due south.

The Record says: Confucius extolled Yao as "great" and praised Shun for "non-action"—what did he mean by this? Heaven is one and the same. In its boundless entirety, it is called "great"; in its soundlessness and scentlessness, it is called "non-action." People see the sun and call it day, the moon and call it night, cold and call it winter, warmth and call it spring—what is this if not Heaven’s movement? Yet how can they perceive its form? It unfolds as kindness, manifests as awe, bestows as reward, and seizes as punishment—what is this if not the ruler’s enactments? Yet how can they see its traces?

Yao and Shun, though named differently, were in essence one. Had one clamored, "Yao’s achievements tower thus, Yao’s institutions shine thus—why can I not do the same?"—they would have seen his toil but not his ease, his grandeur but not his tranquility. How could they have maintained reverence while facing south? They did not realize that in Shun’s time, governance could not be separated from Yao. If governance could not be separated from Yao, neither could the heart. How could the heart be burdened by even a single thing? Only by keeping the heart free of all attachments could one avoid the slightest outward imposition. This is what is meant by "profound reverence bringing peace to the world"—not the superficial transformation of the people through sights and sounds.

Thus, Confucius repeated, "What did he do?" to deepen his praise.

Gaoyao said: "The Emperor’s virtue was flawless. He oversaw the realm with simplicity, governed the masses with leniency, punished without extending to descendants, rewarded with benefits spanning generations, pardoned transgressions regardless of magnitude, meted out penalties for crimes without leniency for minor offenses, lightened sentences when guilt was doubtful, and weighed merits heavily when achievements were uncertain. Rather than kill the innocent, he would err on the side of irregularity. His love for life permeated the people’s hearts."

The Record says: Shun’s essence—beginning, end, root, and branch—is fully revealed here. For one who rules, leniency is fundamental; in treating others, generosity is fundamental; in governing the people, benevolence is fundamental; in mourning the dead, sorrow is fundamental. Without these foundations, how could one maintain reverence while facing south? Of later ages, only Emperor Wen of Han and Emperor Renzong of Song came close. Yet their achievements did not reach the heights of Yao and Shun, for they lacked a Gaoyao of exceptional talent to share in governance. How could they be expected to cultivate themselves with enduring thought, striving for clarity and diligence? This, too, must not be overlooked.

The *Family Sayings* states: As a ruler, Shun favored life and detested killing. He entrusted office to the worthy and dismissed the unfit. His virtue was like Heaven and Earth, serene and empty; his transformation was like the four seasons, nurturing all things. Thus, the Four Seas embraced his influence, and all living beings flourished. Phoenixes soared, qilin appeared, and birds and beasts were tamed by his virtue. There was no other reason—it was his love for life.

The Record says: Confucius’s praise of Shun was already profound, yet he added, "There was no other reason—it was his love for life." What did he mean? The true king embodies the vast virtue of Heaven and deepens the grace of life. Heaven has four seasons, presiding over the generation of things, not their destruction. Though it enforces severity in autumn and closure in winter, this is precisely to gather and release without end. The ruler wields eight powers, presiding over the nurturing of the people, not their harm. Though he eliminates evil with strictness and suppresses violence with awe, this is precisely to protect and cherish without cease.

Thus, when the Four Fiends were executed, though the world acknowledged their guilt, Shun’s heart was filled with reluctance, as if compelled. Gaoyao carried out the sentence, and the Minister of Justice recognized it—though it proceeded from Shun, it was not his true inclination. Hence it is said: "The world put them to death; it was not Shun who killed them." How did this harm his virtue of loving life? Suppose Shun’s heart had been swayed: if Gaoyao said, "Kill them," and he spared them, sparing them might seem benevolent—but what of the harm to the people? Harming the people is not Heaven’s way. If the Minister of Justice said, "Do not kill them," and he executed them, executing them might seem authoritative—but what of the harm to his heart? Harming the heart is not virtue. Thus it is said: "Rather than kill the innocent, better to err on the side of irregularity. The virtue of loving life permeates the people’s hearts."

Shun plucked his five-stringed zither and sang the *Song of the Southern Wind*:
*"The balmy southern wind—
Ah, it can dispel my people’s resentment!
The timely southern wind—
Ah, it can enrich my people’s wealth!"*

The Record says: In Yao’s time, his vast and all-embracing virtue was like Heaven and Earth, sustaining and covering all without exception. Thus, how could the people perceive the Emperor’s power? In Shun’s time, his influence was warm and pervasive, like the wind stirring and breathing upon all things, reaching every corner without omission. Thus, he knew there was resentment to dispel and wealth to enrich. Yet all arose from his heart and responded through his hands, unfolding naturally without premeditation. When this was set to the *Shun’s Music*, how could it not be perfectly good and perfectly beautiful?

The Xia dynasty was swift and precise, its virtue unerring, its benevolence endearing.

The Record says: Yao, Shun, and Yu were all great sages. The *Family Sayings* describes them differently. Yao had long occupied the throne, uniquely revered for all ages; Shun and Yu rose from humble origins, and their engagement with the people could not be equated with Heaven’s majesty. Our Master Confucius’s intent in his words surely had its own purpose.

The *Book of Yu* states: "Virtue is good governance; governance lies in nurturing the people."

The waters, fires, metals, woods, soils, and grains—only through cultivation; in rectifying virtue, facilitating use, and enriching life—only through harmony.

The Record says: How did Yu achieve such swiftness and precision? When the great floods surged to the heavens and the people suffered in mud and ashes, it was precisely because the Five Phases failed to restrain one another, and water and fire could not achieve mutual completion. Thus, Heaven bestowed upon Yu the *Great Plan* of the Nine Categories. Had Yu not acted with swift diligence—reducing excess, supplementing deficiency, and striving for balance—how could the constant norms have been properly ordered? The so-called Six Treasuries and Three Affairs are none other than the royal standard of the *Great Plan*. And that his benevolence was endearing—nothing surpasses this.

The *Zhou Odes* says:
*"We think of Hou Ji’s cultured grace,
Who matched the powers of Heaven’s might.
He fed our multitudes with grain,
No one but owed him boundless right.
He left us wheat and barley bright,
By Heaven’s charge to nurture all.
No bounds, no borders did he slight,
His constant laws through Xia did call."*

The Record says: This "right" is none other than the "utmost goodness" of the *Great Learning*. For Heaven’s heart is in the generation of all things—how could its yin and yang, the Dao of Qian and Kun, not fully realize their potential? If even the slightest measure were lacking, or a single breath failed in benevolence, it would not suffice to generate all things and could not be called Heaven. The sage’s heart is in nurturing the people—how could he not strive for perfection in every grain, whether coarse or fine? If even one creature were deprived or one plot of land left unsuitable, it would not suffice to nourish the people and could not be called Hou Ji. This is the utmost of benevolence, which none but the Duke of Zhou could fully comprehend. Thus arose the sacrifices to honor ancestors and match Heaven, born of righteousness and reverence.

The *Mencius* says: "Humans possess their Dao: when they are fed and clothed, dwell in ease, yet receive no instruction, they verge on the bestial." The sage, troubled by this, appointed Xie as Minister of Instruction, teaching the human relationships: affection between father and son, righteousness between ruler and minister, distinction between husband and wife, order between elder and younger, and trust between friends.

Fang Xun said: "Exert them, summon them, correct them, straighten them, assist them, shelter them, enabling them to find their own way, and further bestow virtue upon them."

The Record says: Fish and turtles cannot sustain life; wood and stone cannot enrich it; birds and beasts cannot establish governance—all would lead to ruin and drowning. Thus, if the people do not eat, they hunger; if they dwell in caves, they toil. Yet the innate goodness of their hearts remains intact. Without instruction, however, human hearts grow confused, human desires run rampant, and Heavenly principle is obstructed. Then all under Heaven—those with teeth and hair—revert to a state worse than horned, maned, clawed, or fanged creatures. Why? The horned merely butt; the maned merely flee; the clawed and fanged merely bite. But humans, without Heavenly principle to restrain them and human desires to guard against, become deceitful and treacherous, harming the people and all things in ways beyond description. Only then do we realize that the Dark King’s laws for all under Heaven, transmissible to later generations, were no mere trifling aid. Was it not fitting that his sacrifices to Yin matched Heaven?

The *Book of Yu* says: "Gao Yao advanced and planted virtue, and virtue descended, so the black-haired people cherished him."

The Record says: Why was Gao Yao’s virtue called "advancing and planting"? For punishment touches the people’s hearts—greatly, it concerns life and limb; subtly, it affects honor and shame. Its impact on the people is most pressing, its penetration deepest, and their fear of it exceeds even that of water and fire. If one knows its weight yet hesitates, avoids suspicion, or shrinks back, this cannot be called "advancing." Even if one grasps the truth of a case, if one cannot temper judgment with compassion, aiming for no punishment, this cannot be called "planting." Without the slightest obstruction—this is "advancing"; without the slightest entanglement—this is "planting." Thus, the people’s harmony within differs not from the Three Sages, and the phrase *"We examine the ancients"* is not amiss in its repetition.

Yi assisted Yu, saying: "Only virtue moves Heaven; nothing is too distant to reach. Pride invites loss; humility receives gain—such is Heaven’s Dao. Utmost sincerity moves the spirits, as when the Miao were subdued."

Yu bowed and accepted this wise counsel, saying: "Indeed!" He then arrayed his troops and marshaled his forces. The Emperor thereupon broadly spread civil virtue, dancing with shields and feathers upon the two steps. Within seventy days, the Miao submitted.

The Record says: Why did Yu achieve such success? When the earth was leveled and Heaven’s work completed, even the distant and near became one—how could a single person be left untouched by Yao and Shun’s grace? Why did Yi offer such praise? In perfect sincerity and accomplishment, one must not claim fullness or indulge in self-congratulation. This is the overflowing of utmost benevolence, extending its fragrance to ten thousand generations—something today’s noble ones must not fail to understand.

The *Book of Shang* says: "Be tolerant and benevolent."

The Record says: "Tolerant" speaks to one’s capacity. Can tolerance be added to benevolence? Master Shao said: "The eras of the Three Kings were like autumn." Like autumn—cold and severe—yet not free from the awe of punitive force. Thus, these two words praise Tang, for he was one who replaced tyranny.

The *Records of the Grand Historian* state: Tang went out and saw a man setting a net on four sides, praying: "May those falling from Heaven, rising from earth, or coming from the four directions all be caught in my net." Tang loosened three sides, leaving only one, and prayed anew: "Go left if you wish to go left, right if you wish to go right, high if you wish to go high, low if you wish to go low. Only those who disobey will enter my net." The lords of Hanzhong heard of this and said: "Tang’s benevolence extends even to birds and beasts." Over forty states submitted to him.

The Record says: Here we see his tolerance. Tang’s campaign against Xia was to save the people. Yet observe his words: "Go left if you wish to go left, right if you wish to go right. Only those who disobey will enter my net."

Alas! If even toward creatures he acted thus—would one commit a single act of injustice, slay a single innocent life, to gain the world? Later ages saw those who forbade the capture of birds and sparrows, erecting steles for the release of living beings. Yet why could they not win the people’s hearts?

Mencius said: "Love kin, then extend benevolence to the people; extend benevolence to the people, then cherish all things." Tang, by diligently manifesting great virtue and establishing harmony among the people, thus turned his compassion toward creatures into a force that drew the multitudes to submit. Had his virtuous deeds not yet reached their fullness, and he merely acted on a fleeting impulse—pursuing mercy with a troubled heart, clinging to purity with rigid resolve, taking non-killing as virtue and Dao-seeking as a mere habit—then his efforts would have been in vain. Such is the intent of this record.

The *Great Learning* says: "Majestic was King Wen, ever reverent in his radiant virtue, as a ruler resting in benevolence." The record states: Heaven’s workings are soundless and scentless. Benevolence is most difficult to describe—can it be sought in the shallow or near? It begins in the faint stirrings of thought, so subtle as to be invisible. Yet when it reaches its fullness, the world cannot contain it, so vast and boundless is it. Wisdom encompasses all things yet does not depart from the heart’s foundation; the Dao sustains the world yet does not extend beyond the confines of a single breast—this is what it means for a ruler to rest in benevolence.

Moreover, the *Odes* praises King Wen as "majestic." The text further declares: "The Son of Heaven is majestic." How unlike the haste of the feudal lords! The Son of Heaven is like Heaven revolving above—profound and unfathomable, thus able to work its wonders with a power that is swift yet not hurried, present yet not moving. The ruler, too, is profound and unfathomable, thus able to govern with a subtlety that requires neither loud commands nor drastic changes. Were Heaven to thunder at every drumbeat or rain at every drop, its ways would be known to all, and none would hold it in awe. Were a ruler’s wrath or joy as plain as a raised finger or a flushed face, how could the people stand in reverence? This is the poet’s profound insight, which must not be overlooked.

Mencius said: "King Wen regarded the people as if they were wounded." The record states: This is the heart that rests in benevolence. Mencius said: "All people possess a heart that cannot bear the suffering of others." Is this not the heart that regards the people as wounded?

One may ask: In King Wen’s time, there were no festering sores, no groaning sufferers. His kindness and care were so thorough that none lacked shelter—why then did he regard them as wounded? Yet the great sage never presumed his own perfection. When summer heat was slight or rain scant, the people grumbled; when spring prayers for cold were unanswered or summer rains fell short, the people grumbled still. Not only this—even the vastness of Heaven and Earth leaves room for regret. How then could King Wen’s heart not be ever anxious and earnest?

Such gradual cultivation of the people in benevolence, penetrating to the marrow and saturating the bones, cannot be achieved in a single morning or evening. In former times, when King Wen governed Qi, those who tilled the land kept nine parts of ten, while officials enjoyed hereditary emoluments. At passes and markets, scrutiny was applied but no taxes levied; ponds and weirs faced no prohibitions, and the families of criminals were not implicated. The old without wives were called *guan*; the old without husbands, *gua*; the old without children, *du*; the young without fathers, *gu*—these four were the most destitute and helpless among all under Heaven. When King Wen issued policies and extended benevolence, he invariably placed these four first. As the *Odes* says: *"To enrich all, yet first reach these toiling and solitary ones."* The record states: This is the practice of resting in benevolence.

Thus it is said that King Wen, ruling over a mere hundred *li*, did not by mere hexagram lines become Son of Heaven. Yet within that hundred *li* of Qi, the ethos of eight hundred years of governance was fully embodied—was this not the administration of all under Heaven? Heaven is called Father, Earth is called Mother, and the people are our siblings. Though distinctions exist between the honored and the solitary, the *guan* and the *gua*, the sage regards them as if they were sores upon his own body or pains within his own flesh. Though he might wish to ignore them, who could ignore them? Though he might wish to defer them, who could defer them?

Yet people fail to emulate the virtue of Heaven and Earth, to follow the nature of Heaven and Earth. Thus they oppress and slaughter the innocent, cast aside the aged and common folk, severing themselves from Heaven without even knowing it—how lamentable! The *Zhounan* says: *"The bream bends its tail; the royal house seems ruined. Though it seems ruined, Father and Mother are ever near."* The record states: This is the effect of resting in benevolence.

Zhou, occupying the throne as Son of Heaven, acted as father and mother to the people. With power over life and death, authority to depose and install, yet the people’s allegiance turned thus—if one seeks the reason, it lies in this: what they desired, he gathered and granted; what they detested, he did not impose. Thus it is said: *"Jie and Zhou lost the world because they lost the hearts of the people."* How then could King Wen have summoned them to come or pushed them to leave? To observe the human heart is to see the heart of Heaven; to observe the fate of the people is to see the Mandate of Heaven—nothing more.

*The "Zhou Odes" states: "Pacify the myriad states, and harvests abound year after year."*
The record notes: This is the true manifestation of the sage’s use of benevolence to serve Heaven, the ultimate response of Heaven’s heart—no mere embellished rhetoric. Yet how did Zhou, though famine-stricken, conquer Yin and still enjoy abundant years? King Zhou of Yin, as lord of all under Heaven, appointed the unworthy, extorted through exactions, and ruled with tyranny. Heaven’s revulsion was as swift and fierce as thunder and lightning—would it discriminate in whom it struck? Thus, Zhou’s famine was the scourge of Yin’s cruelty. Later, when King Wu released the horses on the southern slopes of Mount Hua and set the oxen free in the fields of Taolin, the common people returned to their livelihoods, the good and virtuous were spared, and Hou Ji’s teachings of farming were imparted to Yin’s remnant subjects. Thus, Yin’s peace was Zhou’s blessing. This is the implicit meaning of the record.

*The Comprehensive Mirror* states: South of Jiaozhi, the Yuechang people, after repeated translations, presented tribute, saying: "The roads are distant, mountains and rivers treacherous—we feared a single envoy might not reach you. Thus, we came through threefold translation to pay homage." The Duke of Zhou replied: "If virtue and grace do not extend to them, the noble man does not accept their tribute. If governance and commands are not enacted, the noble man does not serve their people." The interpreters conveyed: "We have received the Mandate to govern our land." The elders of Huangqi said: "For three years now, there have been no violent winds or excessive rains, and the seas have not stirred. We surmised that a sage must have arisen in the Central Kingdom—why not go and pay homage?" The Duke of Zhou attributed this to the king, praising the numinous spirits of the former kings and offering sacrifices at the suburban and ancestral temples.

The record notes: This is a sight unparalleled since the invention of writing—how was such a response achieved? *The Doctrine of the Mean* states: "Thus, the sage’s reputation overflows within the Central Kingdom and extends to the barbarian lands. Wherever the vermilion carriage reaches, wherever human effort penetrates, wherever Heaven covers, Earth bears, the sun and moon shine, and frost and dew fall—all beings with blood and breath revere and cherish him." Hence it is said: "He matches Heaven in sagely spirit, the pinnacle of transformative power." Such was the response. The House of Zhou accumulated merit and amassed virtue for over a thousand years, culminating in the reigns of Kings Wen, Wu, Cheng, and Kang, when the primal forces converged. Heaven and Earth harmonized, all things flourished, the Three Luminaries shone brightly, winds and rains came in season, the mountains of the Nine Provinces were not barren, and the rivers did not run dry. Within the borders, auspicious grain sprouted and double-eared wheat appeared; beyond the suburbs, phoenixes sang and qilin emerged. How then could the distant Eight Wastes not send envoys through repeated translation to pay homage? This was the natural response to the sage’s profound and subtle virtue. Otherwise, what use were the white wolves and white pheasants to the declining Yin, or the bowing and prostrations to the feeble Han? Wang Mang’s flattery and eulogies only served as tools for usurpation—how could they be mentioned in the same breath?

When the Duke of Shao toured the southern lands to disseminate King Wen’s governance, he sometimes rested beneath a sweet pear tree. Later generations cherished his virtue, so they loved the tree and could not bear to harm it, singing: *"Lush is the sweet pear, / Do not cut, do not fell— / The Duke of Shao lodged here. / Lush is the sweet pear, / Do not cut, do not break— / The Duke of Shao rested here. / Lush is the sweet pear, / Do not cut, do not bend— / The Duke of Shao delighted here."*

The record notes: Observing the ode to the sweet pear, I understand how deeply governance and teaching penetrate the people. The bestowal of grace upon things is like the harmonious wind: when it blows in the warmth of spring, people do not resent the confinement of deep winter; like the sweet rain: when it pours forth in the season of growth, people do not forget the withering drought. Though countless years have passed since the Duke of Shao’s time, when we recite his writings and read his poems, his lingering grace is still vivid before our eyes. How much more must those who lived in his era have felt? This is why the noble man is moved by governance that cannot bear to harm others.

The lords of the southern lands followed the Duke of Shao’s teachings and embraced King Wen’s transformative influence. They cultivated themselves, ordered their families, and governed their states. Their benevolence toward the people overflowed to benefit all living things. Thus, the poet praised them, singing: *"That sprouting reed, / One shoot yields five plump stalks— / Ah, the skillful archer! / That sprouting mallow, / One shoot yields five branches— / Ah, the skillful archer!"*

The record notes: Observing the era of the *Two Southern Lands*, I see that its rulers were like qilin, its ministers like *jiaoyu*, its scholars like lambs, and its people like nobles—how fully did harmonious qi permeate it! Harmony is the heart of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the divine and enlightened. When the ruler embodies harmony, the hundred officials gather in harmony below, and the harmony of all things follows naturally. If the ruler is tyrannical, his ministers become like hawks and owls. If the ruler is as harsh as thorns, his ministers become like executioners. Then the land harbors barbarians, the wilds teem with rhinoceroses and tigers—how can its grass and trees flourish, or its birds and beasts multiply? In the second year of the Yongle reign, the Prince of Zhou presented a *jiaoyu*, and the scholar-officials composed odes in the same vein.

*The Appended Judgments* states: "The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is life; the great treasure of the sage is position. How does one preserve position? Through benevolence. How does one gather the people? Through wealth."

The record notes: Since ancient times, many have spoken of benevolence. Only our Master [Confucius] examined it closely. *Qian* is called father, *Kun* is called mother—is it not through the sage’s attainment of position that Heaven and Earth are ordered and the myriad things nurtured? Thus, virtue cannot be merely observed. Only by embodying benevolence can one lead others. Position cannot be merely occupied. Wealth is the heart of the people—gaining the people is gaining the world. Thus, benevolence cannot be applied indiscriminately. As the *Book of Rites* says: "To align with others is benevolence; to pursue profit is resentment." In a single phrase: it lies solely in the distinction between public and private.

Duke Ai asked about governance. The Master said: "The governance of Kings Wen and Wu is recorded on bamboo and wooden slips. When such men exist, their governance is enacted; when they perish, their governance ceases. The Way of man is swift in governance, just as the Way of earth is swift in growing trees. Governance is like the reed and bulrush—pliable yet resilient. Thus, governance depends on men. To secure men, one must cultivate the self; to cultivate the self, one must follow the Dao; to follow the Dao, one must embody benevolence. Benevolence is humanity—loving one’s kin is its essence. Righteousness is appropriateness—honoring the worthy is its essence. The gradations of loving kin and the ranks of honoring the worthy give rise to ritual. Therefore, the noble person cannot but cultivate the self. To cultivate the self, one must serve one’s kin; to serve one’s kin, one must understand others; to understand others, one must understand Heaven."

"There are five universal Ways in the world, and three virtues by which they are practiced. The five are: ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, elder and younger brothers, and the exchange between friends. These are the five universal Ways of the world. Wisdom, benevolence, and courage are the three universal virtues of the world, and there is one principle by which they are practiced. Some are born knowing them; some learn to know them; some come to know them through hardship—yet when they know them, it is the same. Some practice them with ease; some practice them for profit; some practice them through strenuous effort—yet when they succeed, it is the same."

Duke Ai said: "Your words, Master, are beautiful and perfect. Yet I am truly too dull to achieve them." The Master said: "To love learning is near to wisdom; to exert effort is near to benevolence; to know shame is near to courage. Knowing these three, one knows how to cultivate the self. Knowing how to cultivate the self, one knows how to govern others. Knowing how to govern others, one knows how to govern the world and the state."

"In governing the world and the state, there are nine principles: cultivating the self, honoring the worthy, loving kin, respecting great ministers, empathizing with all officials, cherishing the common people, attracting all artisans, pacifying distant peoples, and embracing the feudal lords. Cultivating the self establishes the Dao; honoring the worthy prevents confusion; loving kin ensures that uncles and brothers harbor no resentment; respecting great ministers prevents bewilderment; empathizing with all officials makes the scholars’ reciprocation weighty; cherishing the common people encourages the hundred clans; attracting all artisans ensures sufficiency of resources; pacifying distant peoples makes the four directions submit; embracing the feudal lords makes the world stand in awe."

"Purity of mind, solemn attire, and non-action contrary to ritual—these cultivate the self. Rejecting slander, distancing oneself from licentiousness, despising wealth and valuing virtue—these encourage the worthy. Honoring their positions, increasing their emoluments, and aligning with their likes and dislikes—these encourage love of kin. Appointing many officials to employ them—this encourages great ministers. Loyalty, trust, and generous emoluments—these encourage scholars. Timely employment and light taxation—these encourage the common people. Monthly assessments and rewards commensurate with work—these encourage artisans. Sending off the departing and welcoming the arriving, praising the good and pitying the incapable—these pacify distant peoples. Restoring extinguished lineages, reviving ruined states, stabilizing chaos and upholding the endangered, conducting court visits at proper times, giving generously and receiving modestly—these embrace the feudal lords. In governing the world and the state, there are nine principles, and there is one principle by which they are practiced."

"In all affairs, preparation leads to success; lack of preparation leads to failure. Words decided in advance do not falter; affairs decided in advance are not hindered; actions decided in advance are not remorseful; the Dao decided in advance is not exhausted. If one in a lower position does not gain the trust of superiors, the people cannot be governed. To gain the trust of superiors, there is a Way: if one is not trusted by friends, one cannot gain the trust of superiors. To be trusted by friends, there is a Way: if one does not accord with kin, one cannot be trusted by friends. To accord with kin, there is a Way: if one’s reflection on the self is not sincere, one cannot accord with kin. To make the self sincere, there is a Way: if one does not understand goodness, one cannot make the self sincere."

"Sincerity is the Way of Heaven; achieving sincerity is the Way of man. The sincere do not strive or deliberate yet attain it effortlessly, abiding in the mean—these are sages. Those who achieve sincerity choose goodness and firmly hold to it. They study broadly, inquire carefully, think cautiously, discern clearly, and act earnestly. If there is something they have not learned, they do not cease until they have learned it; if they have not mastered it, they do not cease. If there is something they have not inquired about, they do not cease until they have inquired; if they have not understood it, they do not cease. If there is something they have not thought about, they do not cease until they have thought it through; if they have not attained it, they do not cease. If there is something they have not discerned, they do not cease until they have discerned it clearly; if it is not clear, they do not cease. If there is something they have not practiced, they do not cease until they have practiced it earnestly; if they have not acted with sincerity, they do not cease. If others can do it once, they do it a hundred times. If others can do it ten times, they do it a thousand times. If one truly can follow this Way, though dull, one will become enlightened; though weak, one will become strong."

The record notes: "Governance depends on men, yet can it be achieved without learning and inquiry? This is why our Master stands above the hundred kings and surpasses all others. Moreover, our Master’s discourse on governance encompasses the universal Ways and virtues, the nine principles. Later generations’ discussions of governance focus on laws, decrees, and regulations. They believe that the four characters of the *Analects* are inexhaustible in a lifetime, and that the *Zhenguan* reign records stand above all ages—here, one may take heed."

Mencius said: "All people have a heart that cannot bear the suffering of others. When former kings had such a heart, they enacted governance that could not bear the suffering of others. Governing the world with a heart that cannot bear suffering, one may turn it in the palm of one’s hand." Why is it said that all people have a heart that cannot bear suffering? Now, if one suddenly sees a child about to fall into a well, everyone feels alarm and compassion—not to ingratiate themselves with the child’s parents, not to seek praise from neighbors and friends, nor to dislike the child’s cries.

The record notes: "What is called 'bearing' is like placing a blade to the heart and enduring it. The heart cannot be cut, yet while the edge of a physical blade may be avoided, the intangible edge is difficult to withstand."

Thus, when King Xuan of Qi could not bear the death of a single ox, yet went so far as to destroy ancestral temples, relocate sacred vessels, and imprison the innocent—who could endure such contradictions? When King Hui of Liang could not bear his people’s hunger, yet suffered defeat to Qi in the east, loss to Qin in the west, and humiliation by Chu in the south—how could such suffering be endured? In Mencius’ time, the ancient ways had receded further, and the world was plunged into chaos. The heart of alarm and compassion had all but vanished. Though he debated endlessly, his words were overpowered by the absence of this heart. Had he not pressed upon them the urgency of examining the innate goodness within—something every person could verify for themselves—what benefit would there have been? This discourse on the child falling into the well reveals what even the former sages had not articulated; it cannot be omitted.

When Duke Wen of Teng asked about governing the state, Mencius replied: "The people’s affairs cannot be delayed." As the *Odes* says:
*"By day gather the thatch,
By night twist the ropes,
Hasten to climb the roofs—
Then begin to sow the hundred grains."*

The Way of the people is this: those with constant property have constant hearts; those without constant property have no constant hearts. Without constant hearts, they become dissolute, perverse, reckless, and extravagant, stopping at nothing. Only after they fall into crime does one punish them—this is to ensnare the people. How can a humane ruler in power ensnare the people? Therefore, a worthy ruler must be reverent, frugal, and deferential, taking from the people only in regulated measure. The Xia dynasty levied a tax of one part in fifty; the Yin practiced the *assistance* system of one part in seventy; the Zhou implemented the *thorough* system of one part in a hundred—yet in reality, all amounted to a tithe. *Thorough* means thorough; *assistance* means corvée. As for hereditary stipends, Teng had long practiced them. The *Odes* says:
*"Rain upon our public fields,
Then upon our private plots."*
Only the *assistance* system has public fields. From this, we see that even the Zhou practiced *assistance*.

Establish schools—*xiang*, *xiao*, and *xu*—to educate the people. *Xiang* means nurturing; *xiao* means teaching; *xu* means archery. The Xia called them *xiao*, the Yin *xu*, and the Zhou *xiang*, but the institution of learning was shared by all three dynasties. Their purpose was to clarify human relationships. When human relationships are clear at the top, the common people will be harmonious below. Should a true king arise, he will surely come to adopt this model, making you the teacher of kings. As the *Odes* says:
*"Though Zhou is an old state,
Its mandate is ever renewed."*
This refers to King Wen. If you put this into practice, you too will renew your state.

When Bi Zhan inquired about the well-field system, Mencius said: "Your lord is about to implement humane governance. He has chosen you for this task—you must strive to fulfill it. Humane governance must begin with the demarcation of boundaries. If boundaries are not properly set, the well-fields will not be equitable, and grain stipends will not be fair. Thus, tyrannical rulers and corrupt officials invariably neglect boundary demarcation. Once boundaries are properly set, the distribution of fields and stipends can be determined with ease. Though Teng’s territory is small, it will have both gentlemen and commoners. Without gentlemen, there is none to govern the commoners; without commoners, there is none to sustain the gentlemen. In the countryside, adopt the *nine-one assistance* system; in the capital, let households pay a tithe themselves. Ministers and below must have *gui* fields—*gui* fields of fifty *mu*, and an additional twenty-five *mu* for each surplus laborer. When death or relocation occurs, there will be no disruption to the communal well-fields. Within a village, fields are shared in the same well-field system: neighbors support one another in coming and going, defend one another in watch, and assist one another in illness and hardship. Thus, the hundred surnames live in harmony. A square *li* forms a well-field of nine hundred *mu*, with the central plot as public field. The eight households each have a hundred *mu* of private land, and together they cultivate the public field. Only after public work is completed may they attend to private affairs—this is how the commoners are distinguished. This is the general outline. As for refining and enriching it, that lies with you and your lord."

The record notes: Mencius instructed Duke Wen with the *seven-one* method, just as Zengzi instructed Duke Ai with the *comprehensive thorough* system. Yet Duke Wen was able to send Bi Zhan to inquire about the well-field system—his natural endowment was as far superior to Duke Ai’s as heaven is from the abyss. Since the invention of writing, no one has expounded humane governance more thoroughly than this. Yet the noble person cannot help but sigh in lament. Alas! It is not the speaking that is difficult—it is the doing. How different are the Three Dynasties from later ages? The sagely and worthy ones’ teachings are like a carpenter’s marking line or a physician’s prescription. If one does not wish to craft squares and circles, so be it. But if one desires to craft squares and circles, can one say, "I will dispense with the compass and square"? If one does not wish to apply acupuncture and moxibustion, so be it. But if one desires to apply them, can one say, "I will dispense with the needle and stone"? Thus it is said: Should a true king arise, he will surely come to adopt this model, making you the teacher of kings. The sagely and worthy ones’ ultimate concern is this alone—how could it be the same as later ages, where success is pursued with urgency and results expected by dawn and dusk?

The *Record of Rites: Monthly Ordinances* states: On the day of the Beginning of Spring, the Son of Heaven personally leads the Three Dukes, the Nine Ministers, the feudal lords, and the great officers to welcome spring in the eastern suburbs. Upon returning, he rewards the dukes, ministers, and great officers at court, commanding the prime minister to spread virtue and harmonize decrees, bestow favors and confer benefits, extending them to all the people. In this month, heavenly *qi* descends and earthly *qi* ascends; heaven and earth harmonize, and plants and trees begin to sprout. The king commands the promotion of agriculture to instruct and guide the people. He then performs the sacrificial rites, using no female animals as victims, prohibiting the felling of trees, the destruction of nests, the killing of young insects, fledglings, or unhatched birds, the capture of pregnant animals or those with eggs, the gathering of large crowds, or the construction of coffins and outer coffins. Exposed bones and abandoned corpses are to be buried. In this month, one must not mobilize troops. To mobilize troops will surely bring heavenly calamity. If warfare must arise, let it not begin with me. Do not alter heaven’s Way, do not sever earth’s principles, do not disrupt human order.

The record notes: This concludes with the *Monthly Ordinances* because, as the world declines and morality deteriorates, the Way of humanity lies barren, and the virtue of rulers decays.

Only the saints reverently uphold the Heavenly Dao above and exhaustively fulfill human affairs below. For my part, I must also cultivate this heart in advance and broadly extend the proliferation of benevolence.

*Hongdao Record*, Scroll One, concludes.

*Hongdao Record*, Scroll Two: Benevolence

**Benevolence Between Ruler and Minister**

From the *Records of the Han*: In the first year of Emperor Xiaowen’s reign, during spring, he issued an edict: "Now is the harmonious season of spring, when grasses and trees flourish, all finding joy in their own way. Yet among my people, the widowed, orphaned, solitary, and destitute may face peril and ruin, with none to attend to their sorrows. As the father and mother of the people, what am I to do?" He then deliberated on measures to provide relief and loans.

The record notes: Placing this edict from the first year after the *Monthly Ordinances* is fitting, for the Han succeeded the Qin. The grace of rulers had grown sparse and desolate, akin to heaven and earth sealed in winter. Reading this, one feels as though the withered revive and the severed resurrect—what a magnificent atmosphere! It reveals that the grace of life-giving virtue is never extinguished, even when exhausted to its depths. How could one not consider this for the world?

He further said: "The elderly cannot stay warm without silk, nor be sated without meat. At the start of this year, I did not timely send envoys to inquire after the aged, nor grant them silk, wine, or meat. How then can the children and grandchildren of the realm be encouraged to honor and support their parents?" He commanded the officials to issue an order: in counties and districts, those aged eighty and above were to be granted one *shi* of grain per person each month, twenty *jin* of meat, and five *dou* of wine. Those ninety and above were to receive two bolts of silk and three *jin* of wadding.

The record notes: "Honor the elderly as you honor your own, extending this to others’ elderly"—the emperor may be said to have embodied this heart. Yet while the Lord of the West (King Wen) excelled in caring for the aged, he did not personally bestow gifts but instead enriched the people. He guided their wives and children, teaching them to cultivate and raise livestock. The emperor, knowing to bestow care upon the elderly, dispatched chief clerks to inspect the prefects, magistrates, and officials of the two-thousand-*shi* rank, each sending officers to patrol. Those found inadequate were to be reprimanded. Alas! Why not institute five-*mu* homesteads and hundred-*mu* fields, making local officials responsible for their oversight?

In the twelfth month, he issued an edict: "The law is the standard of governance. Now, those who have already been tried for crimes cause their innocent parents, wives, children, and siblings to be implicated and seized. I find this deeply unacceptable. Abolish the laws on collective punishment and confiscation."

The record notes: Mencius praised King Wen, saying, "The kin of criminals are not implicated." Though the emperor did not fully expand this principle, the vital energy of the Han surged forth. This is why Jia Shan said: When the emperor’s edicts were posted, even the elderly, infirm, and ailing would lean on staffs to go and listen, wishing to delay death even briefly to witness the fruition of virtuous transformation.

In the second year, autumn, ninth month, he issued an edict: "Agriculture is the great foundation of the realm, the means by which the people sustain themselves. Yet some neglect the root and pursue the branch, leading to lives unfulfilled. I am troubled by this. Therefore, this year I personally lead the ministers in plowing to encourage the people. I grant the realm a reduction of half this year’s field taxes."

The record notes: The emperor followed the advice of Jia Yi, a man well-versed in the fundamentals of statecraft. How could he not understand the reasons for abandoning the root to chase the branch? If the people are left to farm as they please, without limits on the amount, it leads to the powerful seizing land and the poor turning to secondary pursuits—this is a discussion that cuts to the root. Those engaged in secondary crafts or idle livelihoods are not unwilling to return to farming, but without even a sliver of land, where can they set foot? Can those who govern fail to adapt?

Jia Yi once urged the establishment of Han institutions to reform Qin laws, but his words went unheeded. Thus, he spoke only of what the emperor could achieve. The emperor’s love for the people was innate, and his personal plowing to lead the realm, along with the reduction of half the field taxes, became a tale of beauty for a thousand generations. Yet to those who truly understand, this may seem merely an encouragement for the powerful, while the common people are still driven by the strong. It is not the way of the Three Dynasties to encourage agriculture.

In the twelfth year, spring, he issued an edict: "The path to guiding the people lies in focusing on the root. I have personally led the realm in farming for ten years, yet the fields have not expanded, and in years of poor harvest, the people show signs of hunger. This is because those engaged in the work are too few, and the officials have not devoted themselves to it. My edicts have repeatedly urged the people to plant trees, yet no progress has been made. This is because the officials have not diligently implemented my decrees or clearly encouraged the people. Moreover, our farmers suffer greatly, yet the officials pay no heed to their hardships. How then can they be encouraged? I grant the farming people a reduction of half this year’s field taxes."

The record notes: The emperor followed the advice of Chao Cuo, a man of harshness and little grace, yet even he understood the importance of agriculture and the value of grain. His proposal to grant ranks in exchange for grain contributions had barely begun when the border regions could be supplied for five years and the commanderies and counties for one year. Thus, he again reduced the field taxes by half. Later dynasties repeatedly implemented policies to grant ranks in exchange for grain, yet none matched this. Why? Because Emperor Wen’s grain contributions were for the people, while later dynasties’ contributions were for themselves. The former used boundless wealth for limited needs, while the latter used limited wealth for boundless desires. This is the difference.

In the thirteenth year, sixth month, he issued an edict: "Agriculture is the foundation of the realm, and no duty is greater. Now, those who personally engage in farming are still subject to taxes and levies, making no distinction between root and branch. This is insufficient to fully encourage agriculture. Abolish the field taxes, and grant the realm’s orphans and widows silk, wadding, and other provisions in fixed amounts."

Here follows the translation:

---

The Record states: From this year onward, for more than a decade, no field taxes were collected from the people—was this not a rarity unmatched through the ages? For the emperor himself cultivated profound stillness, while his generals and ministers favored substance over ornament. Thus, officials remained secure in their posts, the people delighted in their labors, and year by year, stores accumulated while households multiplied in peace.

Yet the empire’s prosperity arose from the emperor’s own virtue, not from extracting gain from the people. What benefit could there be? For the powerful and strong amassed vast fields, claiming more than half the harvest in reckonings. Though the court abolished field taxes, private households still exacted their surplus. Even Yao and Shun could not have brought benefit under such conditions. Thus, the emperor’s grace surpassed that of the Three Dynasties, yet the people’s suffering rivaled that of the fallen Qin. This was because the ruler and his ministers failed to grasp the root, merely enriching the great and mighty. How lamentable!

In the spring of the sixteenth year, third month, an edict proclaimed: "In recent years, harvests have repeatedly failed, compounded by floods, droughts, epidemics, and pestilence. I am deeply troubled. Ignorant and unenlightened, I have not discerned the cause. Is it that my governance has faltered, my conduct erred? Or has the Dao of Heaven turned unpropitious, the bounty of Earth gone unclaimed, human affairs lost their harmony, or the spirits abandoned their offerings—how else could this have come to pass? Have the stipends of officials been neglected, or frivolous expenditures multiplied, that the people’s food should grow so scarce?

When fields are measured, they have not diminished; when the populace is counted, it has not decreased. By mouth, the land should still suffice, yet food remains woefully inadequate—where lies the fault? Is it that the people have turned to secondary pursuits, harming agriculture; that brewing and feasting waste grain; or that livestock consume too much? In matters great and small, I have yet to grasp the crux. Let the Chancellor, the nobles, the officials of two thousand *shi*, and the Academicians deliberate. If there is any way to aid the people, think deeply and speak without reserve."

The Record states: Emperor Wen’s devotion to the people could not be surpassed. Why then did he say, "Ignorant and unenlightened"? For a minister is the ruler’s resource for seeking counsel, dispelling confusion, and resolving doubts. Yet one such as Zhang Cang, who could not distinguish water from earth—how could he be expected to think deeply and speak without reserve? In a word: he fretted not over scarcity but over inequality. Had he possessed a heart for equalizing the people, measuring fields would have sufficed, and counting mouths would have increased abundance. Why then should the past have had surplus while the present suffers want?

He knew only to turn inward but not how to turn aright; he confessed faults but not their source; he summoned the Chancellor, nobles, officials, and Academicians to counsel but not how to counsel. Did not Mencius say: "As for enriching them, that lies with you and your son"? After reading this, those below might still fail to grasp the fault.

In the first year of Emperor Jing’s reign, fifth month, field taxes were reinstated at one part in thirty.

The Record states: To critique Emperor Wen follows the principle of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. To praise Emperor Jing arises from a heart that honors virtue. Jing did not distance himself from Wen’s ways. To have changed nothing of his father’s Dao for three years—could this not be called filial?

In the sixth year of Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han, an edict restored the collection of field taxes at one part in thirty, "as in the former system." The "former system" referred to the first year’s ordinance. The beneficence of Wen and Jing endured long indeed!

---

In the second year thereafter, in the fourth month of summer, an edict proclaimed: "Carved patterns and intricate engravings harm the work of farming. Brocade and embroidery, woven cords and tassels, impair women’s labor. When farming is harmed, it becomes the root of hunger. When women’s work is impaired, it becomes the source of cold. If hunger and cold arrive together, few can avoid wrongdoing. We Ourself plow the fields, and the Empress tends the mulberry trees, to offer grain and silk for the ancestral temple, to prepare sacrificial vessels and robes, and to set an example for all under Heaven. We accept no tribute, reduce the provisions of the imperial kitchen, and lighten the taxes of the counties, desiring that all under Heaven devote themselves to farming. Let there be simple cloth and ample stores to prepare for disasters. Let the strong not encroach upon the weak, the many not oppress the few. Let the elderly live out their years in peace, and orphans grow to maturity. Yet this year, the harvest may fail in some places, and the people’s food grow scarce—where does the fault lie? Some officials act with deceit and fraud, using bribes as currency, plundering the common folk and exploiting the people. County magistrates and local officials, who should uphold the law, instead collude with thieves and steal—this is most senseless. Let all officials of the two-thousand-*shi* rank attend to their duties."

The Record states: Even in the time of Wen and Jing, there were deceitful officials who took bribes and plundered the people, no different from thieves. Why blame not the chief ministers, but only order the two-thousand-*shi* officials to attend to their duties? After Xiao [He] and Cao [Shen] established order, when Chen Ping was asked about money and grain, he could not answer, yet was praised for it. When Bing Ji passed by a corpse by the roadside, he did not inquire, and this was deemed understanding of proper priorities.

King Ling, upon receiving forthright counsel from Wang Ling, dismissed him in disgrace; when Zhou Yafu upheld the emperor’s covenant with unwavering loyalty, he too was dismissed; while Tao Qing, Liu She, and Wei Wan—all mediocre men—how could one expect them to guide and assist the throne in governing the people? Thus, throughout the Han dynasty, not a single minister’s achievements could be praised. When rulers indulge their own whims, groping blindly like a man stumbling in the dark, how can they dare hope that every county magistrate and local official will prove worthy of their posts?

In the third year, during the first month of spring, an edict proclaimed: “Agriculture is the foundation of all under Heaven. Gold, pearls, and jade cannot fill hunger or clothe the cold; though used as currency, their ultimate worth is unfathomable. When harvests fail in some years, it is because those engaged in secondary pursuits are many, while farmers are few. Let commanderies and kingdoms diligently encourage farming and sericulture, increase planting, and thereby secure clothing and food. If officials conscript the people, press them into service, or extract gold, pearls, or jade, they shall be charged with theft for illicit gain.”

The Record states: Emperor Jing did not commission carved ornaments, intricate engravings, brocades, or embroidered silks. In forbidding the mining of gold, pearls, and jade, he differed not at all from Emperor Wen’s reverence for simplicity. The foundation of the two emperors’ abundant prosperity lay precisely here. What is relaxed for the people has limits, while expenditures at the top know no end. If one loosens one measure while spending twice as much, though it may bear the name of relaxation, its encouragement is no different from what Emperor Jing warned against. Thus, after the decree against illicit gain was issued, there arose the custom of leading oxen and wearing calves—those in high positions must not fail to examine this.

The *Book of Han: Treatise on Food and Goods* records: When the Han first rose, even the Son of Heaven could not equip a team of four matched horses, while generals and ministers sometimes rode in oxcarts, and the common folk had no savings. Once the realm was pacified, Emperor Gaozu decreed that merchants could not wear silk or ride in carriages. During the reigns of Emperor Hui and Empress Dowager Lü, officials’ salaries were measured, government expenses calculated, and taxes levied upon the people accordingly. Yet the revenues from mountains, rivers, gardens, and marketplaces—along with the taxes from these sources—from the Son of Heaven down to the enfeoffed lords’ private estates for bathing and anointing, all served their personal upkeep and were not included in the empire’s general expenditures. Grain transported by water from the mountains of Shandong to supply the capital’s officials did not exceed several hundred thousand *shi* per year. Succeeded by Emperors Wen and Jing, who vied in frugality and reverence, nurturing and pacifying all under Heaven, for over seventy years the state knew no trouble. Except in times of flood or drought, the people were all self-sufficient, their households well-provided; granaries in cities and villages overflowed, and government storehouses brimmed with surplus goods. In the capital, coins piled up in the millions, rotting beyond counting; the granaries of the Grand Storehouse held grain heaped upon grain, spilling out in the open until it spoiled and became inedible. The common folk in streets and alleys owned horses, while in the fields and byways they roamed in herds. Those who rode calves or mares were so numerous they could not be gathered together; gatekeepers and watchmen ate millet and meat; officials saw their descendants prosper; and those who held office passed it down as a family name. Thus, every person...

Though there were men of lofty brilliance and magnanimity like Master Dong, none could supplant the age of Emperor Shizong, who delighted in grand achievements; and how could Jia Yi, young and gifted as he was, prevail over the plain-spoken, unadorned Jiang and Guan? Such was the rarity of the meeting of Yi and Zhou with their sovereigns, or of Tang and Wen in mutual aid—times when the virtue of unity could scarcely be repeated.

The *Biographies of Model Officials of the Western Han* records that during Emperor Jing’s reign, Wen Xi served as Governor of Shu Commandery. Benevolent and fond of education, he sought to transform the crude and barbaric customs of Shu. To guide and elevate its people, he selected over a thousand of the most promising young clerks from the commandery and counties—men like Zhang Shu—and personally instructed and encouraged them before sending them to the capital to study under the Erudites. After several years, the Shu students completed their studies and returned. Wen Xi appointed them to key positions, promoting them by merit, and some rose to become commandery governors and regional inspectors. He also established a school in the city of Chengdu, enrolling the sons of local families as students and exempting them from corvée labor. The most accomplished were appointed as clerks in the commandery and counties. He honored filial piety, brotherly respect, and diligent farming, often selecting students from the school to serve in his presence. Whenever he toured the counties, he brought along students well-versed in the classics and of exemplary conduct, dispatching them to teach and guide the people, allowing them to enter government offices and interact with officials. The local clerks and commoners, seeing this, held them in high esteem. Within a few years, many vied to become students of the school, and even the wealthy offered money to gain admission. Thus, the region underwent a profound transformation, rivaling Qi and Lu in cultural refinement. By Emperor Wu’s reign, the court ordered all commanderies and kingdoms to establish schools—an institution that began with Wen Xi. After his death in Shu, the officials and people built a shrine in his honor, where sacrifices have been offered without interruption to this day. The love of literature and refinement in Ba and Shu was the legacy of Wen Xi’s teachings.

The record states: The efforts of Wen Xi were not without cause—indeed, not without cause! For the teaching of the *xiang* and *xu* schools, reinforced by the principles of filial piety and brotherly respect, is the foundation of royal governance. The great achievements of Emperors Wen and Jing were marred only by the lack of this. Heaven, in its benevolence, brought forth this man. Though he did not hold high office in the Han court, his example endured, and commanderies and kingdoms followed suit, establishing schools that persist to this day. He was not only a teacher to kings but also a model for later generations. That a shrine was built to honor him was no accident.

Yue’s Prefect Tuo declared himself emperor, but when summoned along with his brothers and treated with virtue, he submitted and became a vassal, even forming a marriage alliance with the Xiongnu. Later, he betrayed his oath and raided the border defenses. The border guards did not retaliate, fearing that a deep incursion would burden the people. King Wu of Wu feigned illness to avoid attending court, so the emperor sent him a cane and staff. Though his ministers, including Yuan Ang, remonstrated earnestly, the emperor often granted his requests. Zhang Wu accepted bribes of gold and money, but when discovered, the emperor instead bestowed greater rewards to shame him. The court focused on governing through virtue, and thus the realm prospered in wealth and inclined toward ritual and righteousness. Legal cases dwindled to a few hundred, nearly rendering punishments obsolete. Alas, how benevolent!

It is also said: Confucius declared that the people of his time were as upright as those of the Three Dynasties—how true! The excesses of Zhou and Qin, with their dense nets of laws, could not suppress the worthy, but when the Han arose, it swept away the burdensome and harsh, allowing the people to rest. Emperor Wen added frugality and reverence, and Emperor Jing upheld his legacy. Over fifty or sixty years, customs were transformed, and the common people became pure and sincere. The Zhou had its Cheng and Kang; the Han, its Wen and Jing—how splendid!

The record states: Reading these two eulogies, one cannot help but sigh with emotion, glimpsing the enduring grace of the former kings. Thus, they are preserved here in full.

Some may ask: Can they be compared to the rulers of the Three Dynasties? The *Book of Changes* says: "Exhausting principle and fulfilling one’s nature leads to destiny." The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: "Next is to extend to the utmost the partial." For nature cannot be restrained. Thus, before expression, it is called the Mean; when expressed, if it accords with the norm, it is called Harmony. If not, one must correct the partiality of its manifestations to return to the original nature of Heaven’s mandate. This is what the *Hong Fan* means by "establishing and employing the August Ultimate" and "employing the Three Virtues."

Therefore, the sage kings of antiquity governed the world and responded to things by adapting to the times, using yang to expand and yin to restrain, grasping both extremes and employing the Mean among the people. Thus, they guided the world toward the August Ultimate. Though the emperors’ natural endowments approached this ideal, they could not exhaust the principles of things or fully realize the nature of the original substance. They did not broadly seek the wisdom of the primordial sages to align with them, nor did they daily receive instruction to awaken the heart of Heaven. Thus, their achievements were limited to one generation and could not advance to the level of the Three Dynasties.

Huang Ba was keenly perceptive and quick-witted, gentle and yielding. From Emperor Wu’s strict enforcement of laws to Emperor Zhao’s continuation of them, officials were harshly punished, and the bureaucracy became severe. Yet Huang Ba alone gained renown for his leniency and kindness. Emperor Xuan took a personal interest in governance, frequently issuing edicts of grace and favor, but officials often failed to convey them. As governor, Huang Ba selected capable clerks, divided them into districts, and had them announce the imperial decrees, ensuring the people understood the emperor’s intentions. He ordered postal stations and local offices to raise chickens and pigs to aid the widowed, orphaned, and impoverished. He then issued detailed regulations for village leaders, distributing them among the people to promote farming, sericulture, and frugality, eliminating wasteful practices like feeding grain to horses. Huang Ba’s diligence and energy enabled him to implement these measures effectively. Officials and commoners who encountered him scrutinized his every word and action, cross-referencing them with hidden details. When he wished to dispatch an investigation, he chose elderly, incorruptible clerks, giving strict instructions. The clerks dared not stay at postal stations or eat at roadside inns, and they questioned every household without daring to conceal anything. If someone died without means for burial, the local officials reported it, noting where a large tree could be used for a coffin. When officials were sent to verify, they found everything as described. Such was his discernment and wisdom that officials and people could not fathom its source, calling him divine.

The wicked departed, and as Huang Ba governed the commandery, banditry diminished. The villages transformed, nurturing filial sons and respectful younger brothers. To provide for the elderly, he encouraged goodness, guarded against villainy, practiced frugality, and amassed wealth. He promoted planting trees and raising livestock—though these measures seemed trivial, their effects unfolded step by step. Ba thoroughly understood the origins of hardship among widows, widowers, orphans, and the childless, and he established districts and wards to implement moral instruction before resorting to punishment. His primary aim was to foster completion and ensure peace. Thus, he won the hearts of officials and people, and with each passing year, his governance was deemed the finest in the realm. An imperial edict proclaimed: "The Prefect of Yingchuan, Huang Ba, truly embodies wifely obedience and filial piety. Fields are yielded at their borders, and lost items remain unclaimed on the roads." The Son of Heaven, recognizing his administrative achievements, issued decrees to the populace, declaring that the multitude should be cared for, and the widowed, orphaned, and impoverished should be provided for.

For eight years, there were no major criminal cases, and the population grew. Officials and people were guided by moral instruction, and virtue flourished in their conduct. He could indeed be called a worthy gentleman. It is recorded: Confucius told Duke Ai, "When the right person is present, governance thrives; when they are gone, governance withers." Mencius advised the rulers of Qi and Liang, urging them to raise chickens, pigs, dogs, and swine, and to care for the widowed, orphaned, and solitary. Yet none of these lords could act upon his words. Only in the Han dynasty did Huang Ba possess the strength to fulfill them. Thus, the words of sages and worthies shine like the sun and moon, while the heavenly nature of the human heart remains unchanged across ancient and modern times. The foundation of governance is as simple as weaving reeds, and the people should not be divided like Qin and Yue. Alas, his influence was confined to Yingchuan and did not extend across the realm. Though skilled in governing the people, he was less adept as a grand minister. This is why his governance, though effective, did not match the Three Dynasties, nor his achievements those of the sages.

Gong Sui was loyal, honest, resolute, and possessed great integrity. During Emperor Xuan’s long reign, the regions around Bohai suffered annual famines, and banditry surged, yet the local officials could not suppress it. The emperor sought someone capable of restoring order, and the Chancellor and Censor-in-Chief recommended Gong Sui as the Prefect of Bohai, though he was already over seventy. Emperor Xuan said to him: "Bohai is in chaos, and I am deeply concerned. How will you quell the bandits?" Sui replied: "The sea’s edge is remote and untouched by imperial virtue. The people suffer from cold and hunger, yet the officials show no compassion, driving these innocent children to brandish weapons in the marshes. Do you wish me to conquer them or pacify them?" The emperor, pleased with his response, said: "I selected a worthy man precisely to pacify them." Sui replied: "I have heard that governing a rebellious people is like straightening a tangled rope—it cannot be done in haste. Only with patience can it be untangled. I ask that the Chancellor and Censor-in-Chief not restrict me, allowing me to act flexibly within the law." The emperor granted his request.

When the commandery learned of the new prefect’s arrival, they sent troops to welcome him, but Sui dismissed them all. He issued orders to the counties, disbanding the pursuit of bandits. Those carrying sickles, hooks, or farming tools were deemed good citizens, and officials were forbidden from questioning them. Only those bearing weapons were considered bandits. Arriving in a single carriage, he entered the prefectural seat, and the commandery was immediately pacified. The bandits disbanded, and even the pirates along the Bohai coast, upon hearing Sui’s decrees, laid down their weapons and took up plows and looms. Thus, the region was entirely pacified, and the people settled, delighting in their work. He opened the granaries to relieve the poor, lent grain to the needy, appointed capable officials, and ensured the people were comforted and nurtured.

Observing the extravagant customs of the Qi region, where people favored frivolous crafts over farming, Sui personally led by example in frugality and encouraged the people to devote themselves to agriculture and sericulture. He ordered each household to plant one tree, a hundred elms, fifty mulberries, a plot of onions and leeks, two sows, and five hens. Those who carried swords were instructed to sell them and buy oxen, and those with knives were told to sell them and buy calves. He declared: "Why carry oxen and calves at your waist? In spring and summer, you must tend the fields, and in autumn and winter, you must gather the harvest. Store fruits, melons, and gourds, and diligently inspect the fields." The commandery soon accumulated surplus, officials and people grew prosperous, and lawsuits ceased.

It is recorded: Gong Sui’s response is a timeless maxim. The emperor praised his trust in rewards and punishments, and the officials and people praised the resulting peace—such was his achievement. Yet if one truth is met with a hundred falsehoods, how can this be called a revival to rival the virtue of Shang and Zhou? Alas! Gong Sui is gone, and with him, the hooks, clasps, swords, and knives, the competing oxen and calves. Only my fond memories remain. If household fowl and domestic animals flourish, if oxen are led and calves are carried, yet turmoil persists, while words like swords and tongues like blades wield spears and bare blades, turning good people into enemies—what heart drives this? What heart drives this?

Zhao Xinchen, a top graduate in the classics, treated the people as his children and was praised wherever he served. Promoted to Prefect of Nanyang, he was diligent and strategic, devoted to benefiting the people and enriching them. He personally encouraged farming, traversing the fields, staying in villages and wards, rarely resting at home, and frequently inspecting the commandery. He opened water channels, dredged ditches, and constructed sluice gates and dams in dozens of locations to expand irrigation. Year by year, the irrigated land increased, reaching thirty thousand *qing*. The people reaped the benefits, accumulating surplus. Xinchen established equitable water-sharing agreements for the people, carving them in stone at field edges to prevent disputes. He prohibited extravagance in weddings and funerals, ensuring all adhered to frugality. The sons of officials and clerks, who idled and neglected farming, were reprimanded or dismissed, and the worst offenders were investigated for unlawful conduct to set an example.

His transformative influence spread, and the commandery wholeheartedly embraced farming. The people flocked to him, the population doubled, banditry and lawsuits ceased, and officials and people grew close. He was called "Father Zhao." Du Shi, a man of talent, served as Imperial Censor during the *Jianwu* era, pacifying Luoyang. Later, he was sent to Hebei to suppress rebellious bandits and was appointed Magistrate of Chenggao. After three years in office, his governance was exceptional, and he was promoted to Prefect of Nanyang.

He was frugal by nature, and his governance was pure and equitable. He established authority by punishing the violent, excelled in strategy, and reduced the burdens of corvée labor on the people. He devised water-powered trip hammers to forge agricultural tools, achieving much with little effort, which greatly benefited the common folk. He also repaired and expanded irrigation ponds, reclaiming vast tracts of farmland, so that every household in the commandery grew prosperous. His contemporaries compared him to Zhao Xincheng. Thus, the people of Nanyang said: "Before, there was Father Zhao; after, there is Mother Du."

*Recorded:* The *Book of Songs* says: "The joyous and gracious lord is the people’s father and mother." I have heard these words, but never seen such a man—until now. Is this not a delight for all ages?

During the Eastern Han, Zhang Kan was known for his noble aspirations and exemplary conduct. At sixteen, he studied in Chang’an, where the scholars called him "the sagely youth." Emperor Guangwu summoned him to serve as Cavalry Commandant, later appointing him to lead the Tiger-Toothed Cavalry General. When Du Mao campaigned against the Xiongnu at Gaoliang, Zhang Kan was made Prefect of Yuyang. He arrested and bound the cunning and treacherous, enforcing rewards and punishments with absolute reliability, so that officials and people alike gladly served under him. When ten thousand Xiongnu cavalry raided Yuyang, Zhang Kan led a few thousand horsemen in a swift counterattack, crushing them and bringing peace to the commandery’s borders. He then opened over eight thousand *qing* of rice paddies at Husunu, encouraging the people to farm, which led to great prosperity. The people sang:

*"Mulberry trees bear no side branches,
Wheat stalks grow twin ears.
Under Zhang’s governance,
Joy knows no bounds."*

After years in office, the Xiongnu dared not violate the frontier. The Emperor, hearing of this, summoned the fiscal officers of all commanderies to inquire about local customs and the abilities of past and present prefects. Fan Xian, the fiscal officer of Shu Commandery, said: "The Prefect of Yuyang, Zhang Kan, was once in Shu. His benevolence brought grace to the people, and his authority could suppress the wicked. When Gongsun Shu was defeated, treasures piled like mountains, yet when Zhang Kan left office, he rode a broken-down carriage and carried only coarse cloth sacks."

*Recorded:* Emperor Wen of Han once said: "If I had generals like Lian Po and Li Mu, would I fear the Xiongnu?" The ancient Yuyang is now the outskirts of the capital. During the *Jiajing* era, auspicious wheat with twin ears frequently appeared—just as Zhang Kan’s song described. If such virtues were his aspiration, how could the world lack men like him?

*Master Xingzi said:* "Only by refraining from certain actions can one achieve great deeds. Then, what are mountains of gold and jewels compared to wheat with twin ears? The noble man may thus find his own strength."

Zhuo Mao was generous, kind, respectful, and affectionate. Though his fellow villagers and old friends differed in conduct and ability, all admired and delighted in him. When he was appointed Magistrate of Mi, he labored earnestly, treating the people as his children. He commended the good and instructed them, never speaking harshly. Officials and people loved him and could not bear to deceive him. Someone once reported that a post-house chief had accepted gifts of rice and meat from him. Zhuo Mao asked: "Did the chief demand them from you? Did you have business with him and ask him to accept them? Or did you give them out of goodwill in ordinary times?" The man replied: "I simply gave them." Zhuo Mao said: "If you gave them and he accepted, why report it?" The man said: "I heard that a worthy and enlightened lord makes people unafraid of officials, and officials do not take from the people. Now, I fear officials, so I gave them. Since the chief accepted, I came to report it." Zhuo Mao said: "You are deluded. What distinguishes humans from beasts is our capacity for benevolence, love, wisdom, and mutual respect. If you alone refuse to cultivate these, can you soar high and flee far, never to dwell among men?" The chief had long been a good official, and seasonal gifts were customary. Zhuo Mao told the man: "Go home and reflect on this." Thus, the people heeded his teachings, officials cherished his kindness, and moral transformation spread widely—so much so that lost items remained unclaimed on the roads.

When Emperor Guangwu first sought out Zhuo Mao, he issued an edict: "Formerly the Magistrate of Mi, Zhuo Mao, cultivated himself with integrity, upheld his principles with steadfast sincerity, and truly accomplished what others could not. His name resounds throughout the realm, and he deserves the highest reward under heaven. Now, let Zhuo Mao be appointed Grand Mentor and enfeoffed as Marquis of Baode."

The Record states: Ban Yue’s commentary says: "At the beginning of the Jianwu era, when heroes and warlords still stirred unrest, the times were indeed turbulent and pressing. Yet Zhuo Mao, a minor magistrate of unremarkable talent, was the first to receive an imperial summons, honored with gracious words and lavish courtesy. How does this differ from King Wu of Zhou’s elevation of the reclusive Jian to high office? Though Zhuo Mao’s virtue was pure, it was the emperor’s supreme benevolence that made this possible. In this, Emperor Guangwu remains unmatched."

Lu Gong was appointed Magistrate of Zhongmou and governed solely through moral transformation, never resorting to punishments. When litigants Xu Bo and others engaged in prolonged disputes over farmland, successive officials had failed to resolve the case. Lu Gong adjudicated the rights and wrongs fairly, and both parties withdrew, reproaching themselves, abandoning their plows, and yielding the land to one another. Thus, the officials and people trusted and obeyed him.

In the seventh year of the Jianchu era, locusts ravaged the crops of commanderies and kingdoms, their swarms stretching like jagged teeth along the borders—yet they did not enter Zhongmou.

When Prefect Yuan An of Henan heard of this, he doubted its veracity and dispatched his aide Fei Qin to investigate. Lu Gong accompanied him through the fields, and together they sat beneath a mulberry tree. A pheasant alighted nearby, beside which stood a young boy. Qin asked, "Why do you not capture it?" The boy replied, "The pheasant is tending its chicks." Qin started in surprise, rose, and took leave of Gong, saying, "I came to observe your governance at close hand. Now, the locusts do not invade your borders—this is the first marvel. Your transformation extends even to birds and beasts—this is the second. That a mere child possesses such benevolent heart—this is the third. I shall return to the prefecture and report all in full."

That year, auspicious grain sprouted, and Gong was promoted to Judge of the Court of Judicial Review. Yuan An thereupon memorialized the throne with an account of these events, and the emperor marveled at them.

It is recorded: From the Han to the present, over fifteen hundred years have passed, yet the names of Gong, Huang, Zao, and Lu have never faded. Not only were they honored in life and mourned in death, but in truth, they surpassed the ancients and outshone the moderns. How rare their selection! Since the Tang and Wu dynasties, such excellence has become difficult to attain.

**Hongdao Record, Scroll Two (conclusion)** #1 The following text is missing. According to the *Book of Han, Treatise on Food and Goods*, the subsequent passage reads: *"Each person cherished self-respect and held transgression in dread; they first practiced righteousness and shunned disgrace. Thus, the net of law grew sparse while the people prospered. Yet as wealth swelled, arrogance overflowed, and some even resorted to consolidation and domination, wielding force to tyrannize their villages. The imperial clans possessed land, and from the dukes and ministers downward, all vied in extravagance—mansions, carriages, and attire emulated the throne without limit. When things reach their peak, decline follows: such is the nature of change."*

**Hongdao Record, Scroll Three**
**Benevolence**
**The Benevolence of Ruler and Minister**

The *Old Book of Tang, Treatise on Food and Goods* states: At the founding of the Tang, land was allotted to the people as "mouth-share" and "hereditary fields," and taxes were levied through the system of *zu*, *yong*, and *diao*. Expenditures were measured. Since soldiers were maintained through the *fǔwèi* system, the army, though large, incurred no loss. Official posts were fixed in number, so offices did not proliferate, and salaries were easily met. Though it did not match the prosperity of the Three Dynasties, it could still serve as a permanent system.

**Recorded Note:** Emperor Taizong of the Tang cannot be ranked among the ancient sage-kings. Yet in recording his virtues, one cannot help but feel regret. Dong Zhongshu once proposed: "The Qin adopted the laws of Shang Yang, abolished the well-field system, and permitted the buying and selling of land. The rich amassed fields spanning *qiān* and *mò*, while the poor had not even a speck of ground to stand on. How could the common folk not suffer? Though reviving the well-field system would be difficult, we should at least draw nearer to antiquity. Limit the land holdings of the wealthy to aid the destitute and block the path of consolidation." At the time, Emperor Wu was bent on pursuing profit and did not heed the advice. By the reign of Emperor Ai, Shi Dan renewed the proposal, noting that after generations of peace, the wealthy and powerful had amassed fortunes in the tens of millions, while the poor grew ever more destitute. He urged some form of restriction. Yet the powerful and influential found it inconvenient, and the measure was not implemented. Later, Wang Mang exploited the pretext of "royal fields," plunging the realm into deeper chaos and prolonging disaster—what benefit was there? After Jin Wudi pacified Wu, though he instituted a system of seventy *mǔ* per household, the Five Barbarians soon rebelled. Only under Emperor Xiaowen of the Northern Wei did Li Anshe’s proposal for the equal-field system take effect, which the Northern Qi, Northern Zhou, and Sui later adopted. Alas! Who now recalls the four hundred years of the great Han...

One may ask: why did the proposals of great worthies, though repeatedly voiced, prove insufficient, while in the brief span of the Six Dynasties, a single word from Li Anshe sufficed—and when the Tang resolutely implemented it, how could this fool contain his exultant joy?

The Tang measured fields by *bu*: a *mu* was one *bu* wide and two hundred forty *bu* long, and one hundred *mu* made a *qing*. All commoners were registered at birth as "yellow"; at four, as "small"; at six, as "middle"; at eleven, as "adult"; and at sixty, as "elderly." Under the system of land allocation, adults and males aged eighteen or older received one *qing* each—eighty *mu* as "allotted land" and twenty *mu* as "perpetual holding." The elderly, the severely ill, and the disabled received forty *mu*; widows and concubines, thirty *mu*; and household heads, an additional twenty *mu*. Of these, twenty *mu* were designated as perpetual holdings, the rest as allotted land. On perpetual holdings, elms, jujubes, mulberries, and other suitable trees were to be planted, each in specified numbers. Where land was abundant enough to suffice the population, it was deemed a "generous precinct"; where scarce, a "narrow precinct." In narrow precincts, allocated land was halved. For land of varying fertility—where fields were rotated annually—double the usual allotment was granted, but in generous precincts with triennial rotation, no such doubling occurred. Artisans and merchants in generous precincts received half the standard allotment, while in narrow precincts, none was given.

Commoners who relocated or lacked means for burial could sell their perpetual holdings. Those moving from narrow to generous precincts could sell both their perpetual and allotted land. Once sold, no further allotment was granted; upon death, the land reverted to the state for redistribution. All allocations and reclamations occurred in the tenth month, with priority given to the poor and those liable for corvée. Surplus land in a precinct was allocated to neighboring precincts; surplus in a county, to neighboring counties; and surplus in a prefecture, to nearby prefectures.

It is recorded: this was the Tang system of land allocation. After the turmoil of the Five Barbarians, few remained to till the soil. The Later Wei adopted the practice, granting "open fields" to the people—open fields being ownerless wasteland where no trees were planted. Mulberry fields were exempt from allocation limits, for they were the people’s perpetual holdings, their constant cultivation. The Tang inherited this system, distinguishing between perpetual holdings and allotted land. Initially, these were likely not state-owned lands reclaimed and redistributed to the landless. Rather, because mulberry fields were exempt from allocation, they became known as perpetual holdings, while the originally granted open fields were limited as allotted land. Otherwise, if perpetual holdings were state property planted with suitable trees like mulberries and jujubes, how could they still be bought and sold? Since allocations varied by age, labor capacity, and local land availability, with the state reclaiming and redistributing them, the people were merely allowed to consume the produce, not own the land—so how could they sell it outright?

Ancient laws most strictly forbade frequent relocation. The *Royal Regulations* states: "The well-field system is not constant." Mencius said: "For death or relocation, do not leave the village." Yet now, commoners were permitted to move freely, and those relocating from narrow to generous precincts could even sell their allotted land, with only the deceased’s land reclaimed for redistribution. Under such conditions, how could the people not relocate? How could they not lose their land? And how could the reclaimed land be redistributed? These contradictions in implementation raise doubt: was the error in the historian’s record, or in governance itself?

From the Qin onward, over fourteen hundred years passed before a land-allocation system could be implemented—beginning with the Tang, which alone suffices to show its difficulty. Yet the system was not without flaws. Only after the Yonghui era was the ban on buying and selling land enforced, with violators forced to return the land and punished. Alas, this came too late. No wonder land consolidation persisted as before.

All those granted land were to pay two *hu* of silk and three *hu* of rice per adult male annually, termed "rent." Based on local produce, each adult male was to deliver two bolts of silk, two *zhang* of fine silk or *luo*, one-fifth more cloth, three taels of cotton, or three catties of hemp—except in remote regions, where fourteen taels of silver were accepted instead—termed "tribute." For corvée labor, twenty days of service were required per year, with two additional days in leap years; those who did not serve paid three *chi* of silk instead, termed "labor tax." If extraordinary service exceeded twenty-five days, tribute was waived; if it reached thirty days, both rent and tribute were waived, though total service never exceeded fifty days.

A note states: These were the Tang’s tax levies. The system of rent, labor tax, and tribute was based on the adult male population. The term "tribute" (*diao*) implies adjustment—balancing local resources. For instance, silk or fine silk was levied at one *zhang* per region, not two *zhang* of each totaling six *zhang*; cloth and hemp were similarly adjusted. Yet later records describe an annual output of two bolts of silk, two *zhang* each of fine silk and *luo*, one-fifth more cloth, three taels of cotton, and three catties of hemp—or fourteen taels of silver in non-mulberry regions—raising doubts that this burden exceeded the original calculation. Readers should refer to the *Tongdian* and *Huiji Yao* for accuracy. The *Huiji Yao* specifies: based on local produce, each adult male delivered two *zhang* of silk or fine silk, one-fifth more cloth, two taels of cotton, or three catties of hemp for cloth-producing regions, as tribute.

From princes and dukes downward, all held hereditary land. The Grand Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, Empress, maternal relatives above the mourning grade, titled ladies of the first rank and above, imperial princes and officials of the fifth rank and above, those with hereditary titles or whose fathers, brothers, or uncles held active or meritorious posts of the third rank and above, sons of county barons, students of the Imperial University and National Academy, filial sons, obedient grandsons, righteous husbands, and chaste widows—along with their registered households—were exempt from taxes and corvée. Households with taxable members were termed "taxable households." Exemptions applied to the elderly, disabled, severely ill, widows and concubines, private retainers, female slaves, and officials of the ninth rank and above.

Each village submitted annual registers detailing residents’ ages and landholdings, compiled into township records, then county, prefectural, and finally Ministry of Revenue reports. Separate fiscal registers projected the following year’s taxes and labor services, submitted to the Ministry of Revenue. When the state required funds, a memorial was first presented, and the levy amount was posted at county gates and village markers for public notice. In cases of flood, drought, frost, locusts, or losses exceeding forty percent, rent was waived; if mulberry or hemp crops failed entirely, tribute was waived; if land losses reached sixty percent, both rent and tribute were waived; if losses were total, all services were exempted.

A note states: These were the Tang’s policies of relief and restoration. From princes to commoners, all were subject to graded limits, enabling their descendants to preserve their holdings indefinitely. Why, then, could enduring peace not be achieved? Alas, the system was lost almost immediately. Thus, I have observed: the Han descendants upheld the thirty-tax-one system, though their ancestors failed to establish the equitable tithe; the Tang ancestors devised detailed regulations and prohibitions, yet their descendants abandoned frugality and care for the people. Neither matched the governance of the Three Dynasties.

When Taizong first pursued governance with vigor, officials’ evaluations prioritized those who aided the widowed, orphaned, and young. Those who failed in exhortation were punished by reclassification as "concealed households." A note states: This was the Tang’s system of merit and demerit. Directing fifth-rank officials and above to recommend local administrators demonstrated initial emphasis on governance. Evaluating officials by their success with the vulnerable and demoting those who failed showed final accountability. Yet in practice, only prefectural governors were truly scrutinized. Alas, from the Zhenguan era onward, the court favored inner officials over local administrators, often appointing military men as prefects or exiling incompetent capital officials to the provinces. Though the emperor was earnest in governance, could he personally lead the realm? This is why Tang’s capable officials never matched the Han’s in number.

Rent levies varied by harvest timing, terrain, and distance; tribute was collected in the eighth month and dispatched in the ninth. Simultaneous deliveries prioritized distant regions, with villagers responsible for transport. Prefectures annually procured local products as tribute, priced according to silk quality, never exceeding fifty bolts. Exotic goods, delicacies, dogs, horses, hawks, and hounds were not offered without imperial decree. Additional levies were offset against rent and taxes.

A note states: These were the Tang’s transport policies. Later, under the Two-Tax system, summer payments were due in the sixth month and autumn payments in the eleventh—this earlier system was abandoned. At the time, Taizong was deeply attentive to the people, curbing desires and abandoning luxuries, postponing grand ceremonies like fengshan sacrifices and military campaigns. Thus, prefectural tribute was priced by silk quality, never exceeding fifty bolts, and additional levies were credited against taxes. What a noble vision! Yet after Zhenguan, such standards gradually declined.

In times of famine, community granaries provided relief, and if supplies were insufficient, the people were relocated to other prefectures for sustenance. The Left Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs, Dai Zhou, proposed: "From princes and nobles downward, calculate the cultivated land, and in autumn, establish charity granaries based on the harvest in each locale. In years of poor harvest, these would provide for the people." Taizong approved and decreed a tax of two *sheng* per *mu*, with millet, wheat, glutinous rice, or non-glutinous rice collected according to local suitability. In regions with ample land, levies were based on what was sown; in densely populated areas, assessments were made according to the young crops, with lighter burdens. If a field’s yield fell by fourteen percent, half the tax was remitted; if by seventeen percent, the entire tax was waived. For merchants without land, households were classified into nine ranks, contributing grain from five *shi* to five *dou* in gradations. The lowest households and non-Han peoples were exempt. In years of poor harvest, the grain was used to relieve the people. If lent as seed, repayment was due in autumn. Later, in Luoyang, Xiang, You, Xu, Qi, Bing, Qin, and Pu prefectures, ever-normal granaries were established, storing millet for nine years and rice for five; in low-lying, damp areas, millet for five years and rice for three, all codified in regulations.

A note states: These were the Tang’s famine-relief policies. At the time, Taizong placed great importance on the selection of local officials, ensuring that prefects and county magistrates were competent. Thus, community granaries sufficed for relief, charity granaries for provision, and ever-normal granaries for storage. Without capable officials, even if levies were imposed from princes downward based on cultivated land, it would only add another layer of strictures. This, too, is something rulers must understand. In the early Zhenguan era, households numbered fewer than three million, and one bolt of silk could exchange for a *dou* of rice. By the fourth year, rice cost four or five *qian* per *dou*, and for months on end, doors remained unlocked. Horses and cattle roamed the wilds, and travelers journeyed thousands of *li* without carrying provisions. The people and resources flourished, and over 1.2 million from the Four Barbarians submitted in allegiance. That year, the empire recorded only twenty-nine capital sentences, earning the era the name "Great Peace."

Upon his ascension, the emperor often discussed governance with his ministers, saying: "Now, following great turmoil, I fear the people may not be easily transformed." Wei Zheng replied: "Not so. People long at peace grow arrogant and indolent, and the arrogant are difficult to teach. Those who have endured chaos are distressed and suffering, and the suffering are easily transformed—like the hungry readily accepting food or the thirsty readily accepting drink." The emperor deeply agreed, though Feng Deyi disagreed. Ultimately, the emperor followed Wei Zheng’s counsel. That year, the empire enjoyed a bumper harvest, and the scattered returned to their homes. In villages, a *dou* of rice cost no more than three or four *qian*, and from the eastern seas to the southern Five Ridges, doors remained unlocked, travelers carried no provisions, and sustenance was found along the roads. The emperor said to his ministers: "This is the result of Wei Zheng urging me to practice benevolence and righteousness. It is a pity Feng Deyi did not live to see it."

A note states: The *Yijing*’s hexagram *Daguo* says: "The ridgepole sags; it is advantageous to have somewhere to go, and there will be success." The second line reads: "A withered poplar sprouts new shoots; an old man takes a young wife—nothing is inauspicious." Taizong truly possessed extraordinary talent, yet he lacked the celestial virtue and kingly Way as his foundation—like a sagging ridgepole or a withered poplar. Fortunately, the governance of the Zhenguan era was aided by worthy ministers like Fang, Du, Wang, and Wei—like an old man taking a young wife. Thus, though there were signs of sagging beams and withered poplars, there was also a path to success and advantage. The noble man does not reject this.

The *Annals of Song* records: Emperor Renzong embodied Heaven and followed the Dao, perfecting merit and completing virtue, divine in culture and martial prowess, wise and enlightened, sagacious and filial. The emperor’s nature was benevolent, filial, magnanimous, and composed; joy and anger never showed on his face. Initially enfeoffed as Prince of Shouchun, he studied in the Zishan Hall. In the first year of Tianxi, he concurrently served as President of the Secretariat; the following year, he was promoted to Prince of Sheng and enfeoffed as Crown Prince in the ninth month on the *dingmao* day.

A note states: In the millennia of historical records, none have been so purely benevolent as the emperor—he is truly a rarity. Thus, his posthumous title preserves his greatness, offering a model for rulers. The *Mengzi* says: "To nourish the correct nature is the work of a sage." At that time, the emperor’s perfect nature was unspoiled. In such an era, upright men could have made it an age of Yao and Shun. By establishing the Zishan Hall for study, he nurtured his nature without allowing private desires to interfere—this was the work of sage-making, and the Song dynasty’s family tradition surpassed that of Han and Tang. The Assistant Director of the Department of State Affairs, Li Di, was appointed as the Crown Prince’s Attendant.

*Zun Yao Lu* states: Li Di and others often attended banquets with the crown prince and observed his dignified demeanor. Even when entertainers performed before him, he paid little heed. Another day, during a memorial, the emperor remarked: "Even in private, he never speaks or laughs idly."

A note states: Li Di’s noble character was well-known, but declining the title of Grand Tutor was perhaps excessive. The positions of *gong* and *gu* assist the Son of Heaven, while the *shibao* nurture the crown prince—these are ancient and enduring institutions, not innovations of Taizong’s time, existing when established and absent when not. Since the Song dynasty relied solely on chief ministers, the emperor had no *gong* or *gu* to advise him, and thus the crown prince had no *shibao* to guide him. This was a flaw in their system compared to the Zhou dynasty.

In the fourth year, an edict ordered the Grand Tutor to oversee the state, and every five days, the Zishan Hall was opened. The crown prince stood facing south, with assisting ministers and officials in attendance. He listened to their discussions and was told: "Simply uphold the public good, and all will be well."

A note states: The emperor never spoke or laughed idly about himself, and in dealing with others, he strove to uphold the public good. What purity and integrity!

The *Meng* hexagram’s nine in the fifth place states: "A youthful learner—auspicious." Could this not describe this emperor? In the first year of Qianxing, on the *wu-wu* day of the second month, an imperial testament commanded the crown prince to ascend the throne.

A note states: At that time, the emperor was but thirteen—like a dragon newly shedding its skin, not yet ready for clouds and rain; like a qilin newly formed in hoof, not yet ready to tread the earth. Thus the *Yijing* says: "A spring issues from beneath the mountain—*Meng*. The noble person, through resolute action, nurtures virtue." Was this not because his governance had not yet reached maturity, his nature not yet firmly established? Had there been an Yi Yin or a Duke of Zhou to assist him from without, a Tai Si or a Yi Jiang to guide him from within, then even the virtues of Tai Jia or King Cheng would have paled in comparison. Alas! Empress Liu wielded absolute power within the palace, while Ding Wei and his faction conspired without. Had it not been for Wang Zeng’s unyielding integrity in court, serving as a stabilizing force, how could the aspiration of the nine in the second place—resonating with the ruler above—have been fulfilled? Observing the intent behind the Sage’s composition of the *Yijing*, one understands the division that marked the early governance of Emperor Renzong.

In the first year of Mingdao, an edict proclaimed: "I, in my humble person, have inherited this great lineage. I have forsaken the pleasures of the hunt and refrained from constructing terraces and pavilions. For ten years now, I have not dared to indulge in leisure. Yet unexpectedly, within the palace chambers, where precautions against fire were not stringent, a single night’s blaze spread to engulf eight halls. Reflecting on this descent from Heaven’s favor, I examine my conduct and seek respite from remorse. Let all officials within and beyond the court forthrightly point out the shortcomings of the court, concealing nothing, to fulfill my intentions."

A note states: At that time, the emperor was in the prime of youth, without moral failings. His claim to have abandoned hunting and eschewed the construction of terraces and pavilions was no empty boast—so how could such a calamity have arisen from governance? The palace chambers and inner quarters are domains of the *yin* principle, and eight halls represent the culmination of *yin* numerology. As Empress Dowager Zhangxian’s regency neared its end, was this not a harbinger of the removal of the old and the inauguration of the new? In the third month of that year, the emperor began to personally attend to governance. He halted the construction of temples and monasteries, curbed the influence of the undeserving, summoned Song Shou and Fan Zhongyan, and dismissed the eunuchs Luo Chongxun and others. Both within and beyond the court, all rejoiced.

A note states: The personal rule of Emperor Ren and that of Emperor Zhe were most unfortunate. When Emperor Ren took power, he ceased the construction of temples and monasteries; when Emperor Zhe took power, he initiated new policies. When Emperor Ren took power, he curbed the influence of the undeserving; when Emperor Zhe took power, he appointed treacherous men. Thus, one brought universal joy to the realm, while the other disheartened the loyal and good. The distinction between success and failure is starkly evident.

Earlier, Empress Dowager Liu had exercised regency, and in her later years, she relied on the eunuchs Luo Chongxun and Jiang Deming to gather intelligence on external affairs. Through this, Chongxun’s power came to dominate both within and beyond the court.

A note states: A mother empress ruling in place of the emperor, while eunuchs usurped power—what an extraordinary time this was! As Fan Zuyu observed, this was the root of the Song dynasty’s rise and fall, the pivot of the altars of state’s safety or peril, the origin of the people’s fortune or misfortune, the juncture of the advancement or retreat of the noble and the base, the moment when Heaven’s Mandate and the people’s hearts would either unite or part. How could one slight the emperor’s great virtue? Alas! With the dismissal of Luo Chongxun alone, all within and beyond the court fixed their gaze, witnessing the fullness of his virtue.

With the single recall of Liu Huan and his associates, the people’s hearts grew restless, and the path to ruin was already trodden. For ten thousand generations to come, rulers at the outset of their reign must take heed. The emperor, observing how Emperor Zhangsheng had restricted the western sacrifices and undertaken the construction of the Jade Purity Radiance and Responsive Numinous Spirits temples—projects that exhausted the realm’s craftsmanship and exceeded all bounds of extravagance—remarked to his ministers: "Though these are flourishing affairs of a time of great peace, they are nonetheless excessive." The chief ministers of the time could not but bear the responsibility, and Lü Yijian said: "The treasury was emptied, and to this day it has not been replenished—this is the reason." The emperor replied: "In matters such as these, I must exercise restraint."

A note states: This is why the emperor halted such constructions. Confucius said: "For three years, do not alter the Way of one’s father." The interpreters explain: "Three years without change" refers only to those things that ought to be changed but may be left unchanged for the time being. Earlier scholars, fearing a misinterpretation of the Master’s intent, took issue with past errors and faults, thus clarifying the matter. The western sacrifices and the construction of palaces and temples merely squandered the realm’s wealth. But policies like the Green Sprouts and the exemption of labor service, which carved up the people and provoked resentment, risked losing the hearts of all under Heaven. To blame Wang Anshi for this might still be justified, but to attribute it to one’s sovereign or father is not. The wise may see this as a necessary correction, while the unwise may call it an unauthorized change. Yet even the unwise, in merely exposing a parent’s faults, differ greatly from those who seek to atone for past wrongs.

Alas! This moment, when Empress Xuanren offered sacrifice, was unlike the day when Empress Zhangxian withdrew behind the screen. In the early years, as the era of peace lengthened, those seeking office all relied on powerful patrons to advance their careers, and the scramble for favor became the prevailing wind. Emperor Renzong once asked his ministers: "Of late, when officials request an audience, many seek advancement, while few ask to retire—why is this?" Wang Zeng replied: "Seven men sharing a meal—this depends on the times and the court’s preferences. Only if the court suppresses the scramble for favor and honors those who withdraw in quietude will there be hope for a spirit of reluctance to advance." The emperor agreed.

The Record states: This was how the emperor suppressed those who sought undeserved favor. Such men are risk-takers. At first, they fawn and flatter, slander and ingratiate, stopping at nothing; in the end, they lick sores and suck ulcers, indulging the ruler’s vices and descending to every depravity. Thus, the sovereign must deeply detest and utterly reject them. Yet unless he maintains perfect impartiality in his heart and perfect clarity in discerning others, he will inevitably mistake minor integrity for great principle, and under the pretense of reluctance to advance, indulge their restless ambition. Hence it is said: “Purify the heart and know men.” And again: “To know men is wisdom.” Neither can be lacking.

In the second year of Jingyou, Wang Zeng became Co-Chief Minister. By nature upright and steadfast, he conducted himself with constancy in court, spoke little in private, and allowed no one to approach him with private requests. When he promoted or dismissed officials, none knew his reasons. Fan Zhongyan once asked him: “To exalt and advance the worthy is the duty of the chief minister. Your great virtue lacks only this.” Wang replied: “If a chief minister seeks to claim all credit for himself, to whom shall blame be assigned?” Fan admired his words.

When the emperor first ascended the throne, the empress dowager threatened to monopolize power. Wang stood firm in court with stern words, so that eunuchs and favorites dared not encroach, the emperor’s virtue daily grew, and the empress dowager preserved her good name. The Record states: From this, one may glimpse the spirit of ruler and minister in that era.

Wang was praised as a great minister, and his relationship with officials was like that of creation to all things—his heart desired that each fulfill their potential. Yet if some could not, he reflected inwardly. With perfect impartiality and sincerity, he felt no shame. If one busily sought to prove one’s usefulness to claim favor, or resented those set aside, the role of great minister would become ever more untenable. Hence it is said: “Be steadfast, with no other skill.” Even Lü Xu did not escape this failing. This is why his pursuit of favor and avoidance of blame differed from Wang’s stern words and upright bearing.

In the winter of the first year of Qingli, on the eleventh month, the emperor performed the southern suburban sacrifice and issued a general amnesty. Since the western campaign, he had fasted and abstained from meat. Zhang Fangping, Supervising Censor, said: “Your Majesty is like heaven and earth, like father and mother—how can you contend with great boars and wolves? I hope you will use this amnesty to acknowledge fault, demonstrate good faith, and open the path to renewal.” The emperor rejoiced: “This is my heart’s desire.” He ordered Zhang’s memorial sent to the Secretariat. When Lü Yijian read it, he clasped his hands and said: “Your words bring fortune to the altars of soil and grain.” The Record states: This is what Kou Zhun meant when he repeatedly praised Lü as having the makings of a chief minister.

The benevolent must also be courageous—this western campaign should have been vigorously pursued. Yet the gentleman did not compete in this, for was it merely to open the path to renewal for others? When abroad there are no rival states, and at home no calamities, the subtle intent of acknowledging fault and demonstrating good faith is evident.

At that time, Zhang Dexiang, Yan Shu, Jia Changchao, Han Qi, Fan Zhongyan, Fu Bi, and Du Yan served as chief ministers together, while Ouyang Xiu, Yu Jing, Wang Su, and Cai Xiang were all remonstrance officials. When the western campaign was abandoned, Shi Jie rejoiced: “This is an act of great virtue. As one who sings praises, how can I remain silent?” He composed the *Qingli Sacred Virtue Poem*:

Ah, in Qingli,
the third year, third month,
the emperor ascended the dragon throne.
Slowly he emerged from the palace gate,
his great voice resounding,
shaking the six directions,
like the movement of Heaven,
like the eruption of thunder.
At first, hearing the emperor’s solemn words:
“My grandfather, my father,
entrusted me with great responsibility.
I fear to lose or fail it—
truly, I rely on my ministers.”

“You, Dexiang and Shu, were deeply cautious and discreet—long have you served as my ministers, and I commend your loyal service. Changchao, a scholar of broad learning, discussed governance with me, grounding his counsel in classical scholarship.

As for you, Zhongyan—you, whom I truly discerned—when you served as my remonstrance official, you rectified the gates of my court; when you governed the capital, you fortified my defenses with your talent and eloquence. When rebels rose in Xia, you were sent to suppress them. In the scorching heat of June and the deep snows of winter, you endured cold and heat alike, never once complaining of exhaustion.

Later, I gained Bi, and my heart rejoiced in him. He aided me with the Dao, his admonitions profound and earnest. Though I am no Yao or Shun, he chastised himself as if he had failed. In a single year as remonstrance official, his memorials filled baskets.

When the Khitan, forgetting righteousness, dared insult our great state, Bi carried my command without fear or hesitation. Across ten thousand miles of desert, he held fast to his resolve, whether facing life or death. Behold his skin—frost-worn, wind-cracked; observe his heart—tempered like forged iron.

Zhongyan and Bi—one like Kui, one like Qi—were my pillars. Then you, Yan, came to me. Your hair has turned white, your teeth have fallen out, yet your heart remains steadfast as ever. You have walked the proper path without deviation, long presiding over the Bureau of Military Affairs, where military and civil governance never faltered.

I did not know Qi at first. But Qi possesses an extraordinary bearing—his demeanor is open and unconstrained, his character simple and unadorned. He is fit for great affairs, as steadfast as a drum. I appointed you as Yan’s deputy, for my wisdom in discerning men is sound.

As for Xiu and Jing, standing in court, their words were weighty and resolute, their loyalty unmistakable. Though they returned from distant lands, their unyielding spirit remained unbroken. After the death of Su, they upheld loyalty and purity. Once, as censors, they nearly knocked at my bedchamber door. Xiang, though a minor official, was widely known to me. He too offered counsel, admonishing my faults, his integrity as pure and steadfast as Xiu’s.

The emperor’s sagacity distinguishes loyalty from treachery, promoting the worthy and expelling the wicked. The advancement of these many worthies was like plucking reeds—swift and effortless; the removal of great villains was like shedding shackles—sudden and complete.”

**Recorded Note:**
At the time, a copy of the *Qingli Sacred Virtue Poem* circulated in Shu, and people sought to know its author. Yet why only then? Who today would not wish to know them? Chief ministers and remonstrance officials are the vital qi of the state, the sacrificial piglets of the court. The emperor possessed a virtue vast as the wilderness, while these worthies displayed courage bold and decisive. This was a time when Heaven and Earth harmonized, when above and below shared a single purpose—no wonder the worthy advanced like reeds plucked, and great villains fled like shackles cast off.

But what of the so-called “factional strife”? The unity of gentlemen in the Dao is a fine thing, yet how could petty men share their aspirations? Once memorials had been submitted to dismiss them, and then this poem was composed—was this not excessive? Thus, alongside Shi Jie’s eulogy came the slander of the palace maid; alongside the “reeds plucked” came the sighs of “leaves falling.” This marked the beginning of Shi Jie’s misfortune and the rise of factional disputes. The warnings of the sages run deep indeed.

On the *wuzi* day of the fifth month, the two chief ministers offered congratulations. The emperor said: “The heavens have long withheld rain, threatening the people’s fields. I have burned incense and prayed earnestly to Heaven. Last night, in my bedchamber, I suddenly heard a faint rumble of thunder. I rose at once, donned my robes and cap, and stood barefoot in the courtyard. Soon, rain fell, soaking my clothes. After a moment, the rain ceased, and I bowed twice in gratitude before daring to ascend the steps. Now I still hope the withered seedlings may yet be saved.

I had considered issuing an edict blaming myself, suspending music and reducing my meals. But I feared this might resemble empty ritual, and that nothing is better than sincere, secret prayer.”

**Recorded Note:**
Prayer and supplication were not abandoned by the ancients. Some even offered their own bodies in place of sacrificial animals, or swallowed locusts to avert disaster—why then dismiss such acts as mere embellishment? This refers to empty ritual. In ancient times, when a ruler’s virtue moved Heaven, he might then issue six acts of self-reproach. But without true substance, an edict of self-blame, the suspension of music, or reduced meals would be meaningless. This is why the emperor deemed sincere, secret prayer the better course.

Fan Zhongyan, as Participant in Determining Government Affairs, found the emperor ardently pursuing peace and prosperity, frequently inquiring about current affairs. The emperor even opened the Hall of Heavenly Manifestations, summoning the chief ministers for audience and providing brush and paper to record their proposals. Zhongyan, filled with awe, withdrew and presented *Ten Proposals*: clarifying promotions and demotions, curbing favoritism, refining the examination system, selecting capable officials, equalizing public fields, enriching agriculture and sericulture, strengthening military preparedness, extending benevolence and trust, emphasizing decrees, and reforming corvée labor. The emperor, placing full trust in Zhongyan, implemented them all.

**Recorded Note:**
The principles of Wenzheng (Fan Zhongyan) were rooted in the loyalty and integrity of age, placing concern before joy. His moral character was as lofty as the blue sky and white sun—impossible to conceal. Emperor Renzong’s ardor lay in securing worthy men and pacifying the people, treating omens and portents as secondary. His governance flourished like the sun ascending and the moon waxing—boundless in measure.

When Emperor Wen of Han once asked about the empire’s finances and legal cases, Zhou Bo and Chen Ping could not answer and the matter was dropped. How much more so when a ruler opens the Hall of Heavenly Manifestations to summon his ministers, provides brush and paper to encourage their words—who would not be filled with awe? Yet even so, it falls short of antiquity.

Gao Yao said: "To truly follow virtue, one must model clarity and harmonize with assisting counsel." When the Emperor’s inquiries were abundant yet his words and conduct fell short, though his plans were forthright and his intentions keen, his decrees remained unsettled and his achievements unfulfilled. Compared to the anxieties of later ages, Yao and Shun remain forever beyond reach.

At the time, when the two bureaus jointly presented memorials, Han Qi, as Vice Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs, though his duties pertained to the Secretariat, would nonetheless speak his mind in full. Some pointed out his faults, and his colleagues grew displeased. The Emperor alone recognized him, saying: "Han Qi is forthright by nature." Qi outlined seven matters that ought to be prioritized: purifying governance at its root, attending to border defenses, promoting worthy talent, preparing for Hebei, securing Hedong, winning the people’s hearts, and developing Luoyi. He subsequently presented eight measures to remedy abuses: selecting generals, clarifying oversight, enriching finances, curbing favoritism, advancing capable officials, dismissing the incompetent, regulating official appointments, and eliminating redundant posts. The Emperor praised and accepted them. Qi further proposed four strategies: that for now, peaceful relations should be a temporary expedient, while preparing for war and defense remained the true priority; he requested the repair of armor and sharpening of weapons, the construction of Luoyang, and the secret planning of punitive campaigns.

The Record states: The tradition holds that only the benevolent can fully accept forthright counsel. Had Qi not encountered this Emperor, how could he alone have recognized him? Thus, at the end of the Zhiping era, Qi spoke his mind in full, yet Emperor Shenzong remained indifferent. At the beginning of the Xining era, he again spoke his mind in full, but not only did the Emperor ultimately doubt him—he even itemized refutations of Qi’s arguments and inscribed them on stone to proclaim them to the realm. Alas! The same Han Qi—before, he bore no reputation for encroaching on others’ authority or parading his integrity; later, he faced widespread censure and condemnation. Was the difference in his exertions? It lay solely in whether his words were received or not. Thus, observing Shenzong’s failings allows one to perceive Renzong’s benevolence.

In the summer of the second year of Huangyou, the sixth month, an edict was issued: "From now on, prefectures and commanderies shall not present auspicious omens." When Ru Xiaobiao, Magistrate of Wuwei Commandery, presented three hundred and fifty stalks of *lingzhi*, the Emperor said: "I regard abundant harvests as auspicious and worthy ministers as treasures. As for the anomalies of plants, insects, and fish—how can they be prized?" He punished Ru Xiaobiao and admonished the realm against further offerings.

The Record states: Han Wendi and Song Renzong cannot be ranked in superiority. Why, then, did the former reject [such offerings] with ease, while the latter spared Ru Xiaobiao from differing treatment? Confucius said: "Good men, though they may not tread the old paths, do not commit evil. Yet neither have they entered the chamber of the sages." Thus, Han Wendi rejected them, and though rejection might lead to other deviations, he did not act—not that he could not. Song Renzong pondered them, and though his reflection nearly failed to spur action, he could not act—not that he would not. Herein lies the distinction between rulers.

When Wang Gongchen, Director of the Three Bureaus, proposed monopolizing salt in Hebei, the law had been established but not yet implemented. Zhang Fangping, Hanlin Academician, said to the Emperor: "Why monopolize salt in Hebei again?" The Emperor, startled, replied: "This is the first time the law has been established, not a repetition." Fangping said: "When Emperor Shizong of Zhou monopolized salt in Hebei, violators were executed. During Shizong’s northern campaign, elders blocked the roads, weeping as they petitioned, wishing to distribute the salt tax evenly among the Two Taxes—this was the salt money. Is this not a second monopolization?" The Emperor, greatly enlightened, said: "Convey this to the chief minister and abolish it at once." Fangping replied: "Though the edict has not yet been issued, the people already know of it. It should be rescinded directly by imperial hand, not through the offices." The Emperor was greatly pleased and ordered Fangping to secretly draft a handwritten edict to abolish it. Elders of the Hebei region gathered to welcome the edict at Chanzhou, holding Buddhist and Daoist assemblies for seven days to repay the Emperor’s grace. They also carved the edict on stone in Beijing, and all who passed beneath it bowed their heads in tears.

The Record states: What can be praised in the governance of Emperor Huizong’s era is the presence of virtuous intent in his inquiries. Thus, upon hearing a single opinion, he was first startled, then enlightened, and finally acted to abolish [the policy] without delay. How vast is the difference between this and those who listen without reflection and persist without change! Such virtue suffices to move the people’s hearts, and their gratitude knows no bounds.

Wang Gongchen said to the Emperor: "What merit does Fu Bi possess? He merely increases the quantity of gold and silk, enriching the barbarians while impoverishing China." Renzong replied: "Not so. What I cherish are the land and the people; wealth is not what I惜." Gongchen said: "Is wealth not extracted from the people?" Renzong said: "The state’s expenditures are not drawn from a single day’s accumulation. The annual gifts to the barbarians have not yet burdened the people. If war were to break out and troops were mobilized, the yearly expenditures would be incalculable—not like the gradual extraction of today." Gongchen said: "The Rong and Di are insatiable, ever seeking gaps in China’s defenses. Moreover, Your Majesty has only one daughter. If they were to demand a marriage alliance, what then?" Renzong’s expression grew solemn, and he said: "If it benefits the altars of state, why would I惜 a single daughter?" Gongchen, his words cut short, said: "I did not know Your Majesty would humble yourself and cherish the people to such an extent—a ruler like Yao and Shun!" He bowed twice, weeping, and departed.

The Record states: Observing Wang Gongchen’s words, they resemble those of [Wang] Qinruo’s desperate gamble. Not only did they fail to gain traction, but even when the Emperor humbled himself, there was no regret. At this moment, he truly resembled heaven, which covers all without exception, and earth, which bears all without limit. To call him a ruler like Yao and Shun is no exaggeration.

When Wen Yanbo and Fu Bi were both appointed as Chief Ministers, the Emperor once asked Wang Su about selecting a prime minister. Su said: "Only those unknown to eunuchs and palace women would suffice." The Emperor said: "In that case, Fu Bi would be the one." When they were later summoned together to the outskirts, an edict ordered all officials to welcome them. Fan Zhen said: "Honoring them with empty rituals is not as good as advancing them with utmost sincerity."

When Your Majesty appointed these two as Chief Ministers, the entire court declared it a fitting choice. Yet under recent regulations, officials of the Two Bureaus were forbidden from visiting the residences of the Chief Ministers, and all officials were barred from meeting them—this is hardly "advancing them with utmost sincerity." I humbly suggest abolishing the ceremonial suburban welcome and lifting the prohibition on visits, so that Your Majesty’s governance of ministers may achieve mutual benefit.

When the edict was proclaimed, scholar-officials rejoiced in the court. The Emperor sent the eunuch Xian to inform Hanlin Academician Ouyang Xiu, saying: "In ancient times, some ministers were chosen through dreams or divination. Now that I have appointed these men, and the people’s sentiments are thus, is this not superior to dreams or divination?"

**Record states:** Were all Chief Ministers of our dynasty truly beholden to eunuchs and palace women? Yet during the reign of Emperor Renzong, the court teemed with gentlemen, and Li Di, Wang Zeng, Fan Zhongyan, Wen Yanbo, Fu Bi, and Han Qi were especially renowned. Tracing the reason, it was precisely because the appointments reflected the public will of the realm rather than the private inclinations of one man. Not only was this superior to dreams or divination, but it could be transmitted to later generations. Thus, I record the benevolent words of Emperor Wen of Han and the benevolent ministers of the Song to preserve their legacy. Alas! When the Way of ministerial selection is rightly ordered, the myriad states are governed.

Initially, the Hebei and Jingdong regions suffered catastrophic floods, and the people fled to Qingzhou in search of food. Fu Bi urged the local populace to donate grain, supplemented by official reserves, securing over one hundred thousand public and private dwellings. He dispersed the refugees among them for convenience in procuring firewood and water. Officials awaiting appointments who were residing there were all granted stipends to assist. He selected the elderly, weak, sick, and emaciated for relief, recording their labor and promising future memorials to request rewards. Every five days, he sent envoys bearing wine, meat, and rice to comfort them, acting with such utmost sincerity that everyone exerted themselves to the fullest. He permitted the people to freely exploit the resources of mountains, forests, rivers, and marshes for sustenance. When the wheat harvest ripened, the people returned to their homes in accordance with their distance, each receiving grain. In total, over fifty million lives were saved, and tens of thousands were recruited as soldiers.

Previously, disaster relief efforts had gathered the people in walled cities, distributing gruel that bred epidemics and trampling. Some, awaiting food for days without receiving a single bowl, collapsed—so-called "relief" that was in truth slaughter. Fu Bi’s methods, simple and effective, were implemented throughout the empire and became the standard.

The Emperor, upon hearing of this, dispatched envoys to commend and reward him, promoting him to Vice Minister of Rites. Later, when famine struck the Yizhou region, Han Qi was appointed as the Pacification Commissioner. He reduced taxes to encourage grain donations, recruited able-bodied men as local garrison troops, and decreed that for every man enlisted, several members of his family would be spared starvation. He issued an order at Jianmen Pass that refugees seeking to return eastward should not be barred. In Jianzhou, where the famine was most severe, he had previously, during the Mingdao era, encouraged grain contributions. Later, over 160,000 strings of surplus cash were returned to the Ever-Normal Granary. Han Qi said: "This money is the surplus of relief efforts, not official revenue." He distributed it entirely to households of the fourth rank and below, dismissed 760 corrupt, incompetent, or redundant officials, and established gruel stations that saved over 1.9 million lives. Later, as Prefect of Yangzhou and then Dingzhou, concurrently serving as Pacification Commissioner, he rescued millions more famine victims. Imperial edicts lauded his achievements, and neighboring circuits took his methods as a model.

**Record states:** Just as the Emperor’s concern for the people was profound, Fu Bi and Han Qi devoted themselves wholeheartedly to disaster governance. It was as if a nation of myriad blossoms had encountered a master weaver, whose craftsmanship shaped the pattern, or a workshop of fine jade had met a skilled smelter, whose artistry perfected the carving. Heaven does not wish to withhold warmth, yet the cycles of circulation make cold inevitable—relying on our means to counter it, we ensure only warmth. The people do not wish to hunger, yet the vagaries of fortune make famine inescapable—depending on our measures to address it, we prevent suffering.

Though Fu Bi saved over fifty million and Han Qi saved millions more, had they not been truly sincere, regarding the people’s drowning as their own and their hunger as their own, with utmost sincerity moving all—public and private, high and low—how could they have ensured that everyone was treated as themselves? Alas! The methods...

The methods may be transmitted, yet the heart cannot be transmitted—only by fully dedicating the heart to selflessness can one fully dedicate the heart to the governance of the two ministers. In the spring of the eighth year of Jiayou, on the day *xinhai* of the third month, the Emperor passed away. His final edict was issued, and even in the deepest mountains and remotest valleys, none could refrain from rushing forth in grief, their wails unceasing.

The *Record* states: As the *Doctrine of the Mean* says, "Thus, great virtue must accord with one’s position, must secure its emoluments, must attain its renown, must fulfill its longevity." Truly, such an Emperor was rare indeed. For while rank may be attained by others, how could one so young upon ascending the throne, so flourishing in the prime of rule, sustain it for as long as forty-two years—this was unparalleled. While wealth may be attained by others, how could one so effortlessly at ease, so leisurely in repose, preside over an age of such unparalleled peace and prosperity—this was unmatched. While renown may be attained by others, how could one witness the Way of the noble flourish while the way of the petty wane, as in the eras of Kangding and Qingli—this was unrivaled. While longevity may be attained by others, how could one move even those in the deepest mountains and remotest valleys to mourn as though they had lost their parents, their grief so profound—this was unparalleled. Such was the Emperor’s virtue that made him Renzong.

The historian’s eulogy states: Renzong was reverent, frugal, benevolent, and forgiving—qualities innate to his nature. Whenever floods or droughts struck, he would either secretly pray within the palace or stand barefoot before the court. When officials proposed converting the former Jade Clarity precinct into an imperial garden, the Emperor said, "I already find the gardens bequeathed by my predecessors too vast—why would I need more?" His private attire, though often laundered, consisted only of simple curtains and coarse garments, often patched with embroidered cloth. When he grew hungry at night and craved roasted lamb, he forbade its preparation, fearing that the imperial kitchen would thereafter slaughter animals to meet such whims. For all death sentences in doubt, he ordered further review, sparing over a thousand lives each year. When an official of the Ministry of Personnel was once condemned to death for a single error, the Emperor decreed that he never be promoted again.

The Emperor often admonished his ministers: "I have never commended anyone to death—how dare I recklessly impose capital punishment?" When the Xia people violated the frontier, he repelled them beyond the border; when the Khitan broke their covenant, he increased the annual tribute. During his forty-two years on the throne, though the administration of officials seemed indolent and those who took office were seldom harsh or oppressive, and though the penal code appeared lax, the judges were largely fair and impartial. The realm never lacked flatterers, yet they could not undermine the order of the age; the court never lacked petty men, yet they could not overpower the qi of the virtuous. From ruler to subject, all shared a heart of compassion and a government of magnanimity, thus nurturing and fortifying the foundation of the Song for over three hundred years. Yet his descendants, in correcting his ways, gradually led the realm to chaos.

As the saying goes: "For one who would be lord over men, let him rest in benevolence." In this, the Emperor was truly without shame.

The Hu family of Xin’an remarked: During the reign of Renzong, someone once presented twenty-eight clams, each worth a thousand coins. The Emperor said, "A single bite costs a thousand coins—I cannot bear it." When a northern envoy reported that Goryeo had neglected its tribute and suggested sending troops, the Emperor replied, "This is but the fault of their prince. To send troops now would be to slaughter the common people." In the end, he withdrew the forces. When an epidemic struck the capital, he distributed *tongtianxi* rhinoceros horn for treatment. When some suggested keeping it for his own use, he said, "Do I value rare things above the lives of my people?"

When Su Zhe’s examination response was deemed too forthright, some urged his dismissal. The Emperor said, "I seek forthright words—how can I cast them aside for being forthright? What would the realm think of me?" Moreover, he cherished learning and exalted the Confucian Way, upholding its principles with particular vigor. At a lecture for the imperial study, he told his attending ministers, "Though the height of summer brings me no weariness, I fear only that you may be taxed by it."

Alas! In governing with such a heart and striving for order, the Emperor was so pure that none could find fault.

The record states: Someone asked, "The Emperor was truly blameless as a ruler. Yet can he be compared to the sage-kings of antiquity?" The answer came: "Not yet." Had he not read Confucius’ counsel to Duke Ai? "If one truly embodies this Way, even the dull become enlightened, even the weak grow strong." The Emperor’s nature was indeed pure, yet the momentary lapse in virtue with Empress Guo revealed an imperfection in his sagely learning. Though worthy ministers filled his court, none could rectify his character—his benevolence and gentleness were abundant, but his resolute judgment fell short. Thus he remained but a ruler of the Song dynasty. Hence it is said: "Be precise, be single-minded." And again: "Attend to the subtle, seek tranquility." These are the essential methods of the ancient enlightened kings.

*The Five Relations Book* records: Emperor Zhaoxuan of the Song, endowed with innate purity and clarity, practiced filial piety and fraternal love as if by natural disposition. During his twenty years as heir apparent, he deeply understood the Way of the sovereign. Upon ascending the throne, he exerted himself to govern, entrusting matters to others with sincerity. He often said, "For a ruler, nothing surpasses benevolence." Thus he bestowed timely relief like seasonal rains, abolished forced purchases, remitted debts, inquired into the people’s hardships, prioritized agriculture, honored long service, revived neglected institutions, repeatedly exhorted judicial officials to temper severity with leniency, and made compassion for the people his sole concern.

The record states: From the Song to the present, over five hundred years have passed, yet rulers who truly rivaled Zhaoxuan have appeared but once or twice. How splendid his illustrious name and virtuous title must seem to filial descendants and reverent heirs a hundred generations hence!

*The Record of Illustrious Ministers of the August Ming* states: Emperor Xiaojing reigned for eighteen years, ever mindful of the realm. Once, he summoned Minister of War Liu Daxia and asked, "When will the world know peace? When will I govern like the sage-kings of old?" Daxia replied, "One should not seek governance too hastily. In all matters of personnel and policy, if doubts arise, summon the Grand Secretariat and chief ministers to deliberate face-to-face. Once settled, proceed accordingly—this is the natural order, and it is peace." When Censor-in-Chief Dai Shan sought to retire due to age and illness, the Emperor issued an edict: "Tell Dai Shan this: I entrust the affairs of the realm to him as a father does to his son. With peace not yet achieved, how can I bear to let him leave me first?"

The record states: The *Zhou Odes* says:
*"Vast Heaven’s mandate is accomplished,
Two sovereigns received it.
King Cheng dared not rest,
Day and night he laid its foundation,
Attending to its subtleties with care,
Illuminating his single heart,
Thus he brought tranquility to all."*
These words might well serve as an ode to our Filial Emperor. Since the founding of the Ming over a hundred and fifty years ago, the mandate of Heaven has been received by successive sages. Emperor Xiaojing inherited it and truly "dared not rest," laying its foundation with meticulous care, illuminating his single heart—this was especially fitting. His virtue was profound yet unassuming, serene yet rooted, accumulated day and night as he upheld Heaven’s mandate and longed for peace. He was indeed able to continue and illuminate the grand legacy of the Two Founders and Four Ancestors, fulfilling his duty to the utmost. Thus the realm enjoys enduring stability, and the blessings of a myriad ages are secured. Had Heaven granted him more years, what sage-king of antiquity could he not have equaled?

At the time, Minister of Revenue Li Mengyang once submitted a memorial criticizing government policies. The Filial Emperor, enraged, imprisoned him. When the charges were presented, an edict ordered his reinstatement. Later, after Liu Daxia had finished his report, the Emperor asked, "How fare recent affairs abroad?" Daxia kowtowed and replied, "Recently, Your Majesty issued an edict releasing Li Mengyang. Within and without the court, all praise your virtue as vast as heaven and earth." The Emperor said, "Li Mengyang’s words were reckless. I had no choice but to imprison him. The Embroidered Uniform Guard submitted a report, and I tested my attendants by asking how they would respond. One said, 'This man is reckless—he should be handed to the Embroidered Uniform Guard, flogged, and released.' I discerned their intent: they wished for an edict to condemn him, then have him severely beaten to death to satisfy the palace’s anger, leaving me with the reputation of killing a forthright minister. Such disloyalty from my attendants! Thus I immediately ordered his release and reinstatement, without even allowing the judicial officials to propose a sentence." Daxia again kowtowed and said, "In this act, Your Majesty embodies the benevolence of Yao and Shun."

Once, when Zhang Tianxiang, a regional commander in Liaodong, claimed merit for ambushing and killing enemy raiders, Vice Minister of Justice Wu Yiguan sentenced him to death. As Zhang died in prison, the Filial Emperor was furious and personally interrogated Wu in court, intending to impose a heavier penalty. At that moment, Minister of Justice Min Gui and Censor-in-Chief Dai Shan stepped forward and said, "Yiguan’s investigation was incomplete—his crime warrants exile." Though the Emperor’s will was set, they still remonstrated forcefully, saying, "The law is sufficient as it stands." The Emperor then asked Liu Daxia, "Tell me—has any ruler or minister in history ever acted thus?" Daxia replied, "In my youth, I read the *Mencius*, which says: 'When Shun was Son of Heaven and Gao Yao was judge, if Gu Sou killed a man, Gao Yao would merely arrest him.' Today’s judicial officials, I fear, act no differently." The Emperor nodded in assent.

The imperial decree was issued the next day, and Yiguan’s punishment was reduced to mere dismissal from office.

Another day, the Filial Emperor summoned Liu Daxia to discuss current governance and the talents of the time. The Emperor said, "Take Shanxi Vice Commissioner Wang Hongru, for instance—he is a man of great promise."

Daxia replied, "Truly, as Your Majesty observes."

Later, Daxia told his fellow townsman, the gentleman Xu Wenxiang, "When the court employs men of this caliber, it is then capable of shouldering great affairs. I am too old to witness it, but you must remember this."

Recorded here: All these instances reflect the Filial Emperor’s sincere heart and profound intent, far surpassing the emperors of recent ages by ten thousandfold. Alas, this humble minister, confined to a distant corner by the sea, has no means to survey the full breadth of the national histories and witness the boundless benevolence of heaven and earth. What little I have glimpsed in the records of ministers’ words and deeds is but a fragment, and so I have compiled these accounts to bring this volume to a close.

*Hongdao Record*, Volume Three, ends here.

[*Note: One character missing in the original; in the *New唐书□Food and Commerce Annals*, it appears as "余". The passage reads: "凡乡田有余以给比乡".*]

*Hongdao Record*, Volume Four
"Benevolence"

**"Filial Benevolence Between Father and Son"**

*The Canon of Yao* states: "Shun’s father was obstinate, his mother was harsh, and his brother Xiang was arrogant, yet he harmonized them all through filial piety."

**Recorded here:** This is the first principle revered by historians of antiquity. Filial piety is the source of all goodness and the fundamental duty of benevolence. Even with the great sagacity of Yao and Shun, in the momentous act of abdication, all that was said was "he harmonized them through filial piety." If so, what virtue of the sages could surpass filial piety?

Mencius said: "The Emperor sent his nine sons and two daughters, along with a hundred officials, cattle, sheep, granaries, and supplies, to serve Shun in the fields. Scholars from all over the world flocked to him, and the Emperor was ready to yield the realm to him. Yet Shun was still troubled, as if he had no refuge, for he was not at peace with his parents. The favor of the world’s scholars is what people desire, yet it could not relieve his sorrow. Beauty is what people desire, yet marrying the Emperor’s two daughters could not relieve his sorrow. Wealth is what people desire, yet possessing the empire could not relieve his sorrow. Honor is what people desire, yet being Son of Heaven could not relieve his sorrow. Nothing—neither favor, beauty, wealth, nor honor—could relieve his sorrow, save only being at peace with his parents. In youth, one longs for one’s parents; when one knows the allure of beauty, one longs for young loveliness; when one has a wife and children, one longs for them; when one enters officialdom, one longs for one’s lord. If one is not favored by one’s lord, one burns with frustration, and even then, one longs for one’s parents all one’s life. To long for one’s parents at fifty—this we see in the great Shun."

**Recorded here:** Yet it is not only Shun. Our present Emperor’s filial piety truly resembles that of the great Shun. Observe how, in his repeated admonitions to his ministers, he does not take pleasure in being Son of Heaven or possessing the realm, but instead sighs and weeps as if he could not bear a single day of ease. His words are fully recorded in the *Great Compendium of Ethics*—truly, he is one who longs for his parents all his life.

Wan Zhang asked: "Some say that with Yu, virtue declined, for he did not pass the throne to a worthy man but to his son. Is this true?"

Mencius replied: "No, it is not. If Heaven grants the throne to a worthy, it goes to the worthy; if Heaven grants it to a son, it goes to the son. Formerly, Yu recommended Yi to Heaven. After seven years, Yu died. When the three years of mourning were complete, Yi withdrew before Yu’s son before the northern slopes of Mount Ji. Those who came to court, to pay tribute, or to settle disputes did not go to Yi but to Qi, saying, ‘He is our lord’s son.’ Those who sang praises did not sing for Yi but for Qi, saying, ‘He is our lord’s son.’ Dan Zhu was unworthy, and Shun’s son was also unworthy. When Shun assisted Yao and Yu assisted Shun, they served for many years, and their beneficence to the people was long-lasting. Qi was worthy and could reverently carry on Yu’s Way. When Yi assisted Yu, he served for few years, and his beneficence to the people was not long-lasting. The time between Shun, Yu, and Yi was long, and whether their sons were worthy or not was a matter of Heaven, not something men could bring about. What happens without being made to happen is the work of Heaven; what arrives without being sought is fate."

**Recorded here:** This marks the beginning of hereditary rule, a path followed by ten thousand generations without alteration. Only after exhausting the mind and knowing one’s nature can one speak of Heaven; only after fully understanding principle and exhausting one’s nature can one speak of fate. If even the slightest trace of these remains unfulfilled, one cannot avoid becoming like Zhao Pu, who spoke of Heaven and fate. What Zhao Pu established was not the utmost impartiality of the realm, for nothing can replace the utmost love of human nature; what he conferred was not the utmost intent of the ancestral line, for nothing can manifest the utmost grace of succession. Thus, though Yao and Shun loved Zhu and Jun, for the realm, finding a worthy man was difficult, so they did not forcibly decline. As for Yi, was he not also recommended to Heaven and made known to the people? Yet the people did not go to Yi but to Qi, so there was no forcible seizure. How could this be the work of men? Mencius clarified the reasons for long and short service, distinguishing clearly between worthiness and unworthiness as matters of Heaven’s mandate. This must not escape the recorder’s notice.

*The Counsels of Tai Jia* states: "When the king’s ancestor dwelt in mourning at Tong Palace, he was able to fulfill his true virtue in the end."

**Recorded here:** The heart of compassion is the beginning of benevolence. Why was this said? Is it not because the nature of ordinary men does not stir with sorrow unless they see what is sorrowful, nor with fear unless they see what is fearful? Thus, they gradually drift into moral failings without realizing it, resist instruction without awareness. Should one not consider how to rouse them? Tong Palace was where the royal garments and caps were kept, the place of morning and evening rites. Even an ordinary man, seeing the pines and cypresses there, would be moved to emotion. How much more so for Tai Jia, whose heart must have swelled with reverence and awe? His closeness to the former king’s teachings far surpassed the admonitions of tutors and guardians. Thus, he did not draw near to sensual pleasures that constantly assailed his eyes, nor did he begrudge correcting his faults, ever vigilant in his heart. This is how his former transgressions transformed into the virtue of fulfillment—was this not the work of compassion?

*The Unremitting* states: "In the time of Gao Zong, he had long labored among the people. When the petty men acted, and he ascended the throne, he observed mourning and did not speak for three years. Only when he did not speak did his words bring harmony."

**Recorded here:** The Shang dynasty’s simplicity resembled the customs of high antiquity. The crown prince is the foundation of the realm. He should not be treated as inferior or superior, yet he was made to dwell long among the common people, sharing their labors. This shows how Xiao Yi loved his son—not with the indulgence of later ages, but with a sincerity that was true and unfeigned.

The court is the foundation of the myriad affairs, where favor must not obscure righteousness—yet he observed mourning and did not speak for three years. This shows how Gao Zong loved his father, not with the empty rituals of later ages, but with a love born of natural heavenly nature.

Such were the lofty virtues and noble deeds of the rulers of the Three Dynasties, not merely spoken of in terms of exalted rank or wealth.

*The Greater Odes* states:
*"Like intertwining melons, the people’s first beginnings,
From the lands of Tu, Ju, and Qi,
Gu Gong Dan Fu,
Carved caves and dug dwellings,
Ere houses were built."*

**Recorded here:** Why does *The Odes* speak of *"intertwining melons"*? It is because King Tai laid the foundation for royal succession. *"Intertwining"* refers to the tracks of the chariot’s wheels. The people of Bin said: *"He is a man of benevolence—we cannot lose him!"* Those who followed him came as if to market. Was this not the chariot-track of a true king? Later, King Wu inherited King Tai’s legacy—this was the *"intertwining"* thread. Without the customs of *"carving caves and digging dwellings,"* how could the ambition to overthrow Shang have arisen? Those who observe well must discern this.

It further states:
*"Then came Wang Ji,
Whose virtue was in action.
Tai Ren conceived,
And gave birth to this King Wen."*

**Recorded here:** I observe that in the flourishing age of Cheng Zhou, fathers and sons, grandfathers and grandsons, achieved such greatness—yet in Yao’s time, this was not so. Why? Perhaps when heaven and earth first opened, the *qi* was not yet fully pure. By the Zhou, the true *yuan* had converged, not merely through the accumulated blessings of a single family, but through the accumulated sincerity of the world—this was no matter of a single morning or evening. Otherwise, how could the lands of Qi and Wei compare with the descent of Xi and Wei? *The Biographies of Exemplary Women* states: *"Tai Ren’s nature was upright, sincere, and solemn. During her pregnancy, her eyes did not behold unseemly sights, her ears did not hear unwholesome sounds, her mouth did not utter arrogant or reckless words. She gave birth to King Wen, who was enlightened and sagely. Tai Ren taught him one thing, and he understood a hundred, becoming the model of Zhou’s noble lords."* It is said that Tai Ren was capable of *tai jiao* (fetal education).

**Recorded here:** Whenever I consider the principle of *tai jiao*, I cannot but marvel at the profound truth it contains. Heaven-endowed nature is formless; the union of man and woman involves *qi*. The formless cannot be spoken of in terms of good or evil, for nature is inherently good. But in the realm of *qi*, right and wrong, good and evil begin to diverge. Not only this, but nobility and humility, long life and early death—all are determined here. This is the division of the *qi* and substance one receives at birth, fixed and unchanging from the moment of life. That it culminated in the founding of the Zhou house was only fitting.

*The Doctrine of the Mean* states: *"He who was without sorrow—was it not King Wen?"* With Wang Ji as his father and King Wu as his son, the father laid the foundation, and the son carried it forward.

**Recorded here:**

Confucius said: *"The humane are without sorrow."* The exegetes explain: *"Their principle is sufficient to overcome selfishness, hence they are without sorrow."* With Wang Ji as his father, had King Wen allowed selfish desire to prevail, he would have indulged his impetuous impulses, thereby entrapping his father in impropriety. With King Wu as his son, had selfish desire prevailed, he would have prematurely usurped the throne, thereby entrapping his son in disloyalty. Taking this as a lesson, later generations still aspire to emulate King Wen of Zhou. Alas, how numerous are those who claim to be King Wen!

His queen and consorts harbored no jealousy, and thus his descendants were many. His numerous concubines dwelled in harmony like a swarm of *lisi* insects, and his descendants flourished. The *Book of Songs* praises them, saying:
*"Like the wings of the *lisi*, gleaming and joyous—may your descendants be thriving!*
*Like the wings of the *lisi*, humming in unison—may your descendants be boundless!*
*Like the wings of the *lisi*, clustered in ranks—may your posterity be abundant!"*

**Recorded here:** How can one say that such virtue rightfully merits such fortune? For those before him, many royal houses failed to establish lasting legacies, and how could they endure? Those after him often met with hidden calamities that could not be suppressed, and how could they long persist? If a man’s words to his parents and brothers reveal no discord, his filial piety is evident. If his words never depart from the lips of his consorts and principal wife, his virtue is manifest.

Harmony does not mean the women and children merely chatter in delight; rather, like fish strung in order by rank, each receives favor according to her station, and none fails to benefit from the grace of his reign. Prosperity does not resemble the withered willow sprouting new shoots; when the king extends his rule to the household, mutual love prevails. Such was the family code of King Wen. Discussing virtue in this light, his virtue was vast; speaking of fortune, his fortune was great.

King Wen’s queen cultivated virtue in herself, and all her descendants were transformed by goodness. Thus the poet extols them, saying:
*"The hooves of the qilin—how the lord’s sons thrive! Ah, the qilin!"*

**Recorded here:** In my foolish observation, no royal beginning has ever been so genuine and free of pretense, nor has any eulogy been so intimate and rich in meaning. Thus, though the qilin may dwell in the wilds, it has never been seen. Of the four spiritually endowed creatures, it is formless yet appears in groups. The lord’s sons bear its likeness, yet none so perfectly as those who "thrive" in emulation. This is how the followers of the sage deeply grasp the power of observation and inspiration—far beyond mere recitation and admiration.

Yet the Shang had Waibing and He Dan who died young; the Han had the Prince of Yin and the Young Emperor who met untimely deaths; the Tang had the strife of Jiancheng and Guangji; the Song had the disputes over Guangmei and Dezhao. Where else has there been a succession like that of Wen, Wu, Cheng, and Kang of Zhou? Truly, this is no false omen of royal virtue.

**As the records state:** When King Wen fell ill, King Wu was displeased and tended to him in full court regalia. When King Wen ate once, he ate once; when King Wen ate twice, he ate twice. Only after twelve days did he inquire after his father. King Wen asked King Wu: *"What did you dream?"* He replied: *"I dreamed the Lord granted me nine *ling*."* King Wen said: *"What do you take this to mean?"* King Wu said: *"There are nine states in the west; perhaps you will ultimately pacify them."* King Wen said: *"No. In ancient times, *ling* referred to age. I am ninety of your years, and I share three with you."*

King Wen died at ninety-seven, and King Wu at ninety-three.

**Recorded here:** Why did King Wu have such a dream? His love for his father was profound—what is called *"preceding Heaven, yet Heaven does not oppose it."* Why did King Wen receive such a response? His love for his son was profound—what is called *"following Heaven and complying with its timing."* If even Heaven does not oppose it, why should men doubt or dispute it?

Though the bodies of Wen and Wu were two, the sincerity that connected them knew no separation. From the first meal to the second, and even after twelve days of inquiry, his devotion to his father was pure. Among all things under Heaven, what could surpass this? Even wood, stone, pigs, and fish may be moved, let alone the supreme principle of spirit and illumination.

As for the ages of ninety-seven and ninety-three, these were the actual responses of principle, coinciding with those numbers. Even without adding King Wen’s three years, how could one know that King Wu’s life was not shortened? In any case, human life is measured by a century, and one should not be overly fixated on such details. The reader should not let the words obscure the meaning.

From the *Zhou Odes* ["Min Yu Xiao Zi"]: "Our house has met with misfortune; sorrow and grief weigh heavily upon me. Oh, my august father, may you be eternally filial. I think of my royal ancestors, who descended to the court. As for me, the humble one, I rise early and retire late in reverence. Oh, may the august kings’ succession continue, their ordered thoughts never forgotten."

**Recorded Commentary:** What is meant by "continuing the work of Wen and Wu and honoring the root of great transformation"? The great transformation of Heaven and Earth is called *ren* (benevolence); the supreme virtue of the sage is called *xiao* (filial piety). All that pleases this one man and responds to the timely virtues of the lords is but the unfolding of this foundation. Thus, when Tai Jia mourned at Tong, when Gao Zong dwelled in seclusion during his grief, and when King Cheng grieved with unceasing sorrow—these three kings, in their excellence as heirs and guardians, followed the same Dao. The filial piety of the august kings sought nothing else; its origin lay in Heaven, a true and earnest expression of the innate heart. Their thoughts extended to their ancestors, a profound concern reaching even the subtlest depths. Their essence was attuned to the spirits, a boundless compliance. This is why they thought to continue the succession without forgetfulness.

Later, when the Great Han arose, its governance was no different in this regard. After the reigns of Yuan and Cheng, this Dao declined. No wonder the scholars of the classics were so earnest in their exhortations.

**"Gu Ming" (The Testamentary Charge):** In the fourth month, on the day of *zaishengchou*, the king did not rest. On the day *jiazi*, the king bathed and purified himself, donned his ceremonial cap and robes, and leaned upon his jade table. He summoned the Grand Protector Shu, the Earl of Yin, the Earl of Tong, the Duke of Bi, the Marquis of Wei, the Duke of Mao, the Master of Ceremonies, the Tiger Warriors, and the hundred ministers and officers. The king said: "Alas! My illness grows severe. As the end nears, and my condition worsens, I fear I may not live to swear my testament. Now I earnestly instruct you: In former times, Kings Wen and Wu displayed their radiant glory, established their grand array, and taught their precepts through practice. By not deviating from their practice, they overcame Yin and received the great mandate. You who come after, take heed and revere the Heavenly majesty. Succeed to the great teachings of Wen and Wu, and dare not be negligent or transgress. Now Heaven has sent down this illness; I do not rise, nor do I awaken. You must heed my words and respectfully protect my eldest son Zhao, aiding him through hardship and peril."

**Recorded Commentary:** This is how King Cheng ensured a proper end, just as King Kang began his reign rightly—both may serve as models for ten thousand generations. Entrusting the orphan and the mandate to such men as Zhou had was truly exceptional. With the royal house’s most esteemed kin bearing the weighty duty of Grand Protector, though there was the distinction of ruler and minister, their shared joys and sorrows were like those of companions in a boat tossed upon the currents or riders galloping side by side on a broad road—how could they not be vigilant? King Cheng, at the outset, had to be warned and restrained from later complacency; without the Duke of Zhou, how could he have preserved his own clarity? In the end, he proclaimed his radiant glory and fulfilled the great mandate; without the Duke of Shao, how could he have respectfully protected his eldest son? This sense of hardship and peril King Cheng personally experienced, so his words were earnest and full of meaning—not like the reckless gambits of An Liu or Xia Hou.

The king further said: "Pacify the distant and bring near the capable; reassure and encourage the great and small states. Consider that men may disrupt my dignity. Do not let Zhao rashly offer tribute in improper circumstances."

**Recorded Commentary:** By this point, King Cheng differed not at all from the sages of antiquity. For *ji* (subtle signs) were the essential teachings of the Yu court—only the most discerning could perceive them, and only the most resolute could decide upon them. This was the result of his diligent cultivation of the Way, not some casual conjecture. In action, responding to all things, how could one forget for even a moment the succession of the court, the descent of the ancestral line? In stillness, practicing vigilance in solitude, how could one allow even an instant of wrongdoing in the myriad affairs? Yet the heir was especially urged because his heart was not yet pure, his grasp not yet firm. Once he stood above others, he might easily grow arrogant; when close to familiar attendants, he might rashly advance improper signs. Then the means to pacify the distant, bring near the capable, and reassure the great and small states would all be lost. This was the profound concern of a dying man, the eternal parting, the ultimate plan for completion, the full achievement of the guardians’ duty. The words of those who speak only of "fine sons and fine wives," seeing only what is done for kin without discerning principle and Dao, are not to be mentioned in the same breath.

The Duke of Zhou said to the Duke of Lu: "The noble man does not neglect his kin, nor does he cause great ministers to resent him. He does not abandon old friends without grave cause. He does not demand perfection from any one person."

**Recorded Commentary:** This was the Duke of Zhou’s family tradition—what Confucius meant when he said, "If Lu were to change, it would reach the Dao." Later, in his governance, the Duke of Lu put the inner before the outer, *ren* before *yi*, so deeply did he take the admonitions to heart. Thus it is said: "Lu’s beneficence extended for ten generations." Lu preserved the traces of the kingly way through its *ren* and generosity—this is why Qi could not equal Lu.

Yet when I once passed through Qufu and observed the temple of the Duke of Zhou, I saw that no one was enshrined there to receive offerings alongside him. In my humble opinion, the virtue of the great sage in life could match Heaven, and in death, none should be paired with him in sacrifice. Moreover, the Duke of Lu’s worthiness did no dishonor to the Duke of Zhou’s teachings—would it not have been fitting to enshrine him there? Perhaps one day this oversight may be corrected.

**"Tan Xi" (Lament):** When Duke Xian of Jin died, Duke Mu of Qin sent a messenger to condole with Prince Chong’er, saying: "I have heard that the fall of a state often occurs at such a time, and the rise of a state often occurs at such a time. Though you, my lord, are solemn in your mourning garb, grief cannot last forever, nor can opportunity be lost. Consider this carefully." Chong’er reported this to his uncle Jiu Fan, who said: "My lord, decline the offer. A man in mourning has no treasure; *ren* and kinship are his only treasure. What does it mean that your father has died?"

Moreover, if one were to exploit this for personal gain, who in the world could justify such conduct? "My lord, decline the offer."

Prince Chong’er replied: "Your lordship’s kindness condoles with this exiled subject, Chong’er. With my person in exile and my father dead, I could not even share in the mourning rites of weeping and wailing. How could I dare cause you further concern? What does it mean that my father has died? Should I harbor any other intention and thus dishonor your righteousness, I would bow my head without prostrating, rise from weeping without private counsel."

Zixian conveyed this to Duke Mu, who said: "Virtuous indeed is Prince Chong’er. To bow the head without prostrating is to refuse succession; thus the bow is incomplete. To rise from weeping is to cherish his father. To rise without private counsel is to reject personal gain."

**Record:** The establishment of a lesser son as heir is not a matter of favor; favor perishes with the father. Chong’er was the eldest, and none could replace him. As for Duke Hui, he neither honored his elder brother above nor his younger brother below, seeking power through external alliances and internal scheming, seizing the throne by mere chance. Chong’er, meanwhile, stood solemn in grief, bowing his head in weeping—his demeanor was clearly unfeigned. Thus, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* does not record Duke Hui’s entry into Jin, nor does it condemn Li Ke, while the *Great Learning* also cites Jiu Fan’s words, all reflecting a spirit of guiding others toward goodness. Who could say that Duke Mu’s decision to receive Chong’er was not settled by Zixian’s report? Had Duke Wen acted thus in every matter, how could he have lingered abroad so long without returning?

Alas! His heart was not pure, and he grew adept at cunning stratagems. Though this was largely the fault of his lack of learning, Jiu Fan’s failure to properly guide his lord and shield him from harm cannot escape reproach.

**From the *Zuozhuan*:** Deng Shu asked Jia Ji, son of Jiu Fan: "Between Zhao Cui and Zhao Dun, who was the worthier?" He replied: "Zhao Cui is like the sun in winter; Zhao Dun, like the sun in summer."

**Record:** The sun in winter is beloved; the sun in summer, feared. Zhao Cui followed the exiled prince with a flask of broth, refusing to eat even when famished—his love was perfect. When Zhao Dun later governed the state, he established institutions, rectified laws, reformed punishments, oversaw promotions, and ensured that all were guided by both reverence and affection. This is why Jia Ji praised him so highly.

**From the *Kong Family Annals*:** Confucius’s ancestors descended from the house of Song. Weizi Qi, eldest son of Emperor Yi of Yin, served as a minister in the royal court and was enfeoffed as a viscount in the state of Wei. When the Duke of Zhou assisted King Cheng, he commanded Weizi to succeed the Yin as ruler of Song. His younger brother was known as Weizhong; Weizhong’s son was Duke Song Xi; Xi’s son was Ding Gong Shen; Shen’s son was Min Gong Xi; Xi’s son was Fufu He, who, though entitled to the succession, yielded it to his younger brother, Duke Li. He’s son was Songfu Zhou; Zhou’s son was Shifu Sheng, who served as a minister in Song; Sheng’s son was Zhengkao Fu; Fu’s son was Kongfu Jia, whose descendants took "Kong" as their surname. Jia’s son was Mujinfu; Mujinfu’s son was Gaoyifu; his son was Fang Shu, who fled to Lu to escape the disaster of the Hua clan, making Confucius a native of Lu. Fang Shu’s son was Boxia; Boxia’s son was Shuliang He, who prayed at Mount Niqiu and begot Confucius.

**Record:** One who traces Confucius’s lineage knows his era, yet why omit his ancestral line? Weizi inherited the legacy of the former kings, and Confucius truly continued the Yin succession. Through three dynasties, their fortunes rose and fell—this may be called perfect *ren*. Kuo spread the Five Teachings and illuminated human relationships, becoming the fountainhead of *ren*, *yi*, ritual, and music for ten thousand generations. Tang succeeded the Xia and ruled the world; his foundation and origins truly began here. By the time of Weizi, another sage arose, and both Emperor Yi and his ministers wished to enthrone him—thus Weizi was surely destined to be a ruler for his generation. Yet when he fled to Zhou bearing the sacrificial vessels, Heaven had abandoned Zhou, though it had not yet fully rejected the Yin. Zhou dared not treat him as a subject but allowed him to preserve his rituals and serve as a guest in the royal house. After several generations, when Zhou’s virtue also declined, Heaven then brought forth the Ultimate Sage to become the fountainhead of *ren*, *yi*, ritual, and music for all ages. Though he did not succeed Zhou as king, he effectively governed in place of the Yin.

Observe how the Master once said: "I study the rites of Yin; the state of Song preserves them." His implicit sense of responsibility is evident. How could this be omitted from discussion?

*The Comprehensive Records* corrects Sima Qian’s omissions, yet it too remains cursory—this is hardly sufficient. Such an account cannot be omitted. At nineteen, Confucius married a woman of the Kai Guan clan of Song, and within a year, Bo Yu was born. When Duke Zhao of Lu sent him a gift of carp, Confucius, honoring the ruler’s grace, named his son *Li* ("Carp") and styled him *Bo Yu* ("Elder Fish"). Bo Yu fathered Ji, styled Zisi, who composed *The Doctrine of the Mean*.

It is recorded: From Xie of Shang down to Tang, and from Tang onward to the enfeoffment in Song, over a thousand years passed before the House of Kong arose. Moreover, from Zheng Kaofu’s service under Dukes Dai, Wu, and Xuan through successive generations, Confucius finally emerged. Confucius then married again into the Kai Guan clan of Song, fathering Bo Yu, who in turn fathered Ji—thus the transmission of the Dao’s lineage found its proper heir. Heaven’s design for ten thousand generations was to continue the past and inaugurate the future, not merely to glorify what came before and enrich what followed. The stakes of this matter are no small contribution; how could it be passed over in silence? It is recorded here to supplement the omissions of the *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Ancient History*, *Comprehensive Records*, and other works.

*The Classic of Filial Piety* states: While Confucius was at leisure, Zengzi attended him. The Master said, "The former kings possessed the ultimate virtue and essential Dao, by which they brought harmony to the world. The people lived in concord, and none above or below harbored resentment. Do you understand this?" Zengzi rose from his mat and said, "Shen is dull—how could I presume to know it?" The Master said, "Filial piety is the root of virtue and the wellspring from which teaching arises." Resuming his seat, he continued, "Your body, hair, and skin are received from your parents—dare you not preserve them? This is the beginning of filial piety. Establish yourself and practice the Dao, glorify your name in later generations to bring honor to your parents, be loyal in serving your lord, and bear in mind your ancestors, thereby cultivating their virtue."

It is recorded: What, then, is this "ultimate virtue and essential Dao"? It is the heart. Why is the heart called "ultimate" and "essential"? Because it speaks to the world, the people, and those above and below—hence its ultimacy and essentiality. Why does it address the world, the people, and those above and below? Is this not because it is ultimate and essential? The world is vast, yet the sage deems it a burden—this is universal bestowal. The myriad people are numerous, yet the sage deems them a burden—this is aiding the multitude. Those above and below are unequal, yet the sage deems them a burden—this is the measuring square. How could one simply cease? Though the world is vast, kinship is one; though the myriad people are numerous, love is singular—this is the culmination of filial piety. Filial piety begins with serving one’s parents and ends with establishing oneself. *The Greater Odes* says: "None..." Though those above and below may be discordant, harmony is one. Kinship and harmony—these were the former kings’ heart, ample and unconstrained, expansive and generous. Though unseen, it could be applied to the hundred clans; though unheard, it could serve as a model for the four seas. Thus it is said: "The root of virtue and the wellspring from which teaching arises." This is the inception of the text, the foundation of the entire classic—not merely beginning with serving one’s parents, but clarifying the fivefold filial piety: loyalty in serving one’s lord and culmination in establishing oneself.

Youzi said: "Of those who are filial toward their parents and fraternal toward their elder brothers, few delight in defying their superiors. Of those who do not delight in defying their superiors, none delight in creating disorder." The noble person devotes himself to the root, for once the root is established, the Dao arises. Has there ever been one who was filial and fraternal yet failed to be *ren*? This is the root of *ren*."

It is recorded: Filial piety and fraternity are the root of *ren*. The root is like the trunk of a tree. A thing with a root will have branches, limbs, and leaves—thus one must cultivate the root, for the vital force resides here, not there. Suppose there is a person who greets others with a harmonious demeanor yet neglects his family—can he be called *ren*? Or suppose another is filial and fraternal toward his brothers yet treats others with hostility—is this possible? Thus it is said: "Of those who are filial and fraternal, few delight in defying their superiors. Of those who do not delight in defying their superiors, none delight in creating disorder." Yet this is merely the ordinary practice of the Dao, involving no particularly lofty or difficult deeds. Why, then, does the noble person devote himself so earnestly to it? Precisely because once the root is established and the Dao arises, it can be extended to heaven, earth, and the myriad things, each finding its proper place. Is this not the root of *ren*? The disciples, observing Youzi’s words and conduct, saw his bearing resembled that of the sage, and so recorded them at the beginning of the text. Thus, is devotion to the root not the foremost principle of constant practice?

Mencius said: "There has never been one who was *ren* yet neglected his parents." It is recorded: What is meant by "neglecting one’s parents"? It refers to the five types of unfilial conduct in common custom. Only the un-*ren* are ensnared by selfish human desires and commit such acts. The *ren* person, with every step and every word, dares not forget his parents. Thus, he listens for what is soundless and observes what is formless—how could he be indolent in his limbs? At home, he exerts utmost reverence; in providing for them, he ensures their joy—how could he indulge in gambling or drinking? What his parents love, he also loves—how could he covet wealth or favor his wife and children? Colors do not fade from his eyes, sounds do not cease in his ears—how could he follow the desires of his ears and eyes? In high position, he is not arrogant; in low position, he does not create disorder; among the vulgar, he does not contend—how could he delight in bravery or fighting? These are the greatest blessings of human relations, the boundless benefits of the family way, and the opening passages of the Three Classics—how could they not be examined?

Mencius also said: "The substance of *ren* is serving one’s parents." It is recorded: This "substance" is not opposed to the ornamental, nor is it like the kernel of a fruit. Rather, it is the inherent and ultimate destination. Thus it is called "substance." For *ren* to be *ren* is not an empty designation. It arises from heaven’s endowment of the parent-child bond, the utmost love of our nature, and the inherent destination of serving one’s parents.

Thus it is called *ren*. Below this, *yi*, *zhi*, *li*, and *yue*—none are otherwise. As for *yue*, life arises, and once life arises, how can it be stopped? Here, the full embodiment of *ren* reveals its great function, manifesting its utmost expression. Then hands dance and feet stamp, yet all emerge from these five. Their inherent destination requires no external seeking, no borrowed aid—it directly shows humanity the vital and vibrant Dao.

Generally, the words of sages and worthies are like the work of creation, containing all vitality within. Though people see them as layered petals, they are but a single bud, and what unfolds from within is the substance of *ren*. Let the reader ponder deeply.

*The Lesser Odes* says:
*"Vast and desolate is the marker—*
*Not a marker, but mugwort.*
*Turning back, I mourn my parents,*
*Who bore me with toil and labor.*

*Vast and desolate is righteousness—*
*Not righteousness, but weeds.*
*Mourning now my parents,*
*Who bore me with weariness and hardship.*

*The vessel is empty,*
*Yet shame remains for the unworthy.*
*The orphan’s life—*
*Better to have died long ago.*

*Without a father, what support?*
*Without a mother, what reliance?*
*Going out, none to guard or pity;*
*Coming in, none to receive.*

*Father, you gave me life;*
*Mother, you nurtured me.*
*You stroked me, cherished me,*
*Raised me, reared me,*
*Watched over me, returned to me,*
*Carried me in and out.*
*I long to repay your virtue—*
*Vast as heaven, without end."*

*"The southern mountain stands stern,*
*Whirling winds howl fiercely.*
*None lack sustenance—*
*Why am I alone afflicted?*
*The southern mountain looms steep,*
*Whirling winds rage wildly.*
*None lack sustenance—*
*Why do I alone not endure?"*

Recorded: The words of a well-ordered age flow smoothly, their phrases even; the words of a declining age are forced, their phrases sharp and urgent.

Thus, those who bring their mothers to live with them do not do so out of ignorance of their toil, care, and nurturance. If a ruler probes their true feelings and reproaches them with words, then they will harbor no private resentment. As for Lu Gu and Lu Fei, they were not unaware of the shame of a broken wall or the sound of an empty jar, yet they remained cautious in their wanderings—this still allowed them to fully express their devotion. Now, having been unable to complete their filial service and exhaust the love of a child, and lacking any labor or compassion to demonstrate the duty of a subject to their lord and father, with no one to blame, they turn the fault upon themselves, saying: "It is not I, but the artemisia," or "Vast as heaven, without end." Their cries to heaven and longing laments—how could these be restrained?

As for the lines *"The southern mountain stands stern, / Whirling winds howl fiercely,"* these express what cannot be fully conveyed. They weep tears of blood, exhausting their grief and resentment without even realizing it. Mencius said: "Shun was the greatest of the filial. Even at fifty, he longed for his parents." If this poem is not the most profound expression of love and longing, what is?

*The Record of Rites* states: "The filial child who harbors deep love must possess a harmonious qi. One with harmonious qi must have a joyful countenance. One with a joyful countenance must have a gentle demeanor. When a filial child holds jade, it is as if bearing a full vessel—steady and reverent, as though unable to bear its weight, as though about to lose it. Sternness and severity are not the way to serve one’s parents."

Recorded: Zixia said: "In serving one’s parents, one should exhaust one’s strength." Yet Confucius taught him: "The difficulty lies in the countenance." What does this mean? When Shun wailed to heaven, saying, "I have exhausted my strength plowing the fields and fulfilling my duties as a son," it is clear that the expression of one’s countenance differs from the exertion of one’s strength. For the bond between father and child is rooted in affection: parents are not merely parents—they are the ones who have made me who I am; I am not merely myself—I am the one who exists for my parents. The countenance arises from the movement of qi. It cannot be feigned or forced. When the heart is at peace, the qi is harmonious; when the qi is harmonious, it fills the face with an expression that arises naturally, without conscious effort.

Zixia was not merely a man of principle; he was cautious in his observance of ritual. He feared that one might mistake exhausting one’s strength for fulfilling benevolence, so the Master enlightened him. Otherwise, with Zixia’s mastery of literature and the many records of ritual that came from his disciples, how could he not have known that sternness and severity are not the way to serve one’s parents?

Zengzi said: "When a filial child cares for the elderly, they delight their hearts without opposing their wishes; they please their eyes and ears, ensuring their comfort in rest and movement, and in their food and drink, they serve them with devotion." Thus, what parents love, they also love; what parents respect, they also respect. Even dogs and horses are treated thus—how much more so should one serve one’s parents as a human being?

Recorded: The so-called "devoted service" means exhausting one’s heart in loyalty, which differs from merely exhausting one’s strength. Mencius said: "When Zengzi cared for Zeng Xi, whenever there was wine or meat, he would ask whom to share the leftovers with, and if asked whether there was any remaining, he would say there was." Yet was this the only way? Zeng Xi loved jujubes, and Zengzi could not bear to eat them—what act was not an expression of exhausting his heart? In serving one’s parents as Zengzi did, one may nearly fulfill benevolence.

Zilu said: "How grievous is poverty! In life, there is nothing to offer for sustenance; in death, nothing for burial." The Master said: "To sip bean broth and drink water, yet exhaust one’s joy—this is called filial piety."

Recorded: The so-called "exhausting one’s joy" does not mean demanding three sacrificial animals and five delicacies, for then even scholars would have no way to provide good care; nor does it mean urging others to prepare fine wine and grand coffins, for then the poor would have no way to give proper burials. Bean broth is not delicious—it is the abstemious who refine themselves with it. Water is not sweet—it is the drunkard who sobers himself with it. Who would say that a single question does not contain the highest teaching?

The filial children of Nanxia admonished one another in their service:
*"Following that southern slope, / Gathering orchids there, / Longing for the courtyard and hall, / My heart finds no peace.*
*That dweller of the house— / None wander idly about. / Fragrant are your many dishes, / Pure your morning meal.*
*Following that southern slope, / Its grasses lush and green, / That dweller of the house— / His countenance gentle and soft. / Longing for the courtyard and hall, / My heart finds no rest. / Fragrant your evening meal, / Pure your morning offering."*

*"Otter, otter, / By the river’s bend. / Swift waves rush forth— / Cast the net, catch the carp. / The forest birds cry out, / Fed by their young. / When care is deep and respect shallow, / Even birds resemble us. / Increase your reverence, / To bring forth great blessings."*

Recorded: This concludes with a supplementary poem because, as the Way of Zhou declined and benevolence and filial piety waned, there were those who did not act as fathers to their fathers, and those who accused their fathers of stealing sheep. Worse still, some sang during their mother’s mourning, taking callousness as the Way, unaware of the duty to repay one’s roots or the debt of returning nourishment. How lamentable! Are they not inferior even to beasts?

Though this poem lacks words, it is inscribed in the village and used in drinking feasts and musical gatherings. The noble person, through its melody, conveys its meaning, and through its meaning, extends its grace—perhaps then benevolence and filial piety will not be abandoned.

*Hongdao Record, Volume Four, concludes.*
*Hongdao Record, Volume Five.*

**Virtue: The Benevolence Between Father and Son**

From the *Book of Han*: In the first year of Emperor Wen’s reign, his officials petitioned to establish an heir apparent early. The Emperor said: “I am already lacking in virtue. Even if I cannot broadly seek out the worthy and sagacious of the world to cede the realm to them, to preemptively establish an heir apparent would only compound my inadequacy.” The officials firmly insisted: “To establish an heir apparent early is to honor the ancestral temples and altars of state, ensuring the realm is not forgotten. In antiquity, the Yin and Zhou dynasties endured for over a thousand years in peace and stability by following this principle. The succession of heirs through sons has been the unbroken way since time immemorial. The High Emperor pacified the realm and became its founding ancestor, and his descendants have inherited the succession without interruption. Now, to abandon the proper course and debate its impropriety—Prince Qi is the eldest, pure in character, kind, and benevolent. We petition to establish him as heir apparent.” The Emperor then assented.

*Record*: Since the Qin abandoned Fusu and enthroned Huhai, the realm has been thrown into chaos, warfare unceasing, and the people plunged into suffering—never has there been a worse time. As the *Book of Changes* states: “Only with father and son can there be ruler and minister.” Can the bond between father and son be left undetermined? The High Emperor of Han witnessed these ills firsthand, yet even he was swayed by anxious doubts. Though he spoke with such vehement conviction, he could not immediately halt the trend, and thus the Lǚ clan’s rebellion was summoned forth. In the end, the base-born usurped the true line, and the Han nearly met the same fate as the Qin. The scheme to welcome the Prince of Dai was one critical juncture; the edict of the first year was another. The two centuries of the Western Han’s enduring legacy rested upon the will of the people and the Mandate of Heaven. Herein we also see that the bond between father and son, once severed, was restored; its Way, once fallen, was revived. Alas! Can this not be called benevolence?

Emperor Wen, while residing in the Palace of Dai, saw Empress Bo fall gravely ill for three years. Through it all, he never once closed his eyes to sleep nor loosened his sash, and no broth or medicine passed his lips until he had first tasted it himself. Thus Yuan Ang remarked that even Zeng Shen, though but a commoner, would have found such devotion difficult—yet now Your Majesty, as a king, has surpassed him by far.

*Recorded here:* Does one’s conduct toward kin truly differ with rank, or the duty grow easier or harder? The Way of filial piety and fraternal love is the nature of Heaven. From the Son of Heaven to the humblest commoner, the station may vary, but the nature remains unchanged. Follow that nature, and what was difficult becomes easy; turn from it, and what was easy becomes hard. Whether Zeng Shen or the Emperor—who would weigh this lightly?

When Qi’s Grand Granary Prefect, Chunyu Yi, was convicted of a crime punishable by mutilation and sent under guard to the capital, his youngest daughter, Ti Ying, submitted a memorial: “My father served as an official, and all in Qi praised his honesty and fairness. Now, condemned by law to mutilation, I grieve that the dead cannot be revived, nor severed limbs rejoined. Though he might later seek to reform and begin anew, no path remains. I beg to be enslaved as a palace bondmaid to ransom my father’s punishment and allow him to start afresh.” The Son of Heaven, moved by her plea, abolished the practice of corporal mutilation.

*Recorded here:* Was Emperor Wen of Han not far superior to King Xuan of Qi? The worth of all under Heaven outweighs a single ox at the plow’s tip, and the counsel of great sages surpasses the words of a young girl. Yet when the Emperor bent the law to extend mercy, it was no mere exchange of small for great. Why, then, did many still decry it as misguided? Why not say instead that such a heart suffices to rule as king? If this was not done to curry favor or seek renown—if it arose from no fear of reproach—then it was surely an excess of love, an excess of generosity.

The grandson of Crown Prince Wei of the Han, known as Imperial Grandson, had a son named Bingyi, styled Imperial Great-Grandson. When the boy was but a few months old, the witchcraft affair erupted. The Crown Prince’s sons, daughters, wives, and concubines were all put to death—only the Imperial Great-Grandson survived, though he too was imprisoned. Bing Ji, charged with overseeing the case, knew the Crown Prince was innocent and pitied the Great-Grandson’s undeserved suffering. He selected a trustworthy female prisoner to nurse and care for the child, ensuring he was kept warm and dry.

Later, when the King of Changyi was deposed, Huo Guang and Zhang Anshi, along with other high ministers, debated whom to enthrone. Bing Ji submitted a memorial to Huo Guang: “The grandson of Emperor Wu, named Bingyi, is well-versed in the classics, possesses fine talents, and conducts himself with composure and moderation. I urge you, General, to settle this great matter.”

Huo Guang and Chancellor Chang then jointly memorialized: “The grandson of Emperor Wu, Bingyi, now eighteen, has studied the *Book of Songs*, the *Analects*, and the *Classic of Filial Piety*. He practices frugality in person, is kind and benevolent to others, and is fit to succeed Emperor Zhaoxiao.” The Grand Empress Dowager subsequently decreed: “He may be welcomed.” And so the Great-Grandson ascended the imperial throne.

The Record states: As the saying goes, "When the people unite, they can overcome Heaven; when Heaven's decree is fixed, it can overcome the people." How true this is! The histories relate that Crown Prince Li was benevolent, forgiving, temperate, and prudent, yet the Emperor嫌 his talents, finding them too similar to his own. It is further said: "The Emperor enforced the law with severity, often employing harsh officials. The Crown Prince, however, was lenient and merciful, frequently overturning unjust verdicts." The Crown Prince was sincere and bore no fault against the Han. Yet when the Emperor had grown old and his favor waned, the disaster of witchcraft and curses arose in tumult, and the calamity of chaos erupted suddenly—this was the people overcoming Heaven, hence the perilous state of affairs. Later, when the Emperor's heart awakened and the realm mourned in sorrow, the stones of Mount Tai stood upright without support, and the trees of Shanglin Park rose without summons—this was Heaven's decree overcoming man, hence the perfect alignment as if tallying tokens.

Though Crown Prince Li did not himself rule the realm, his descendants were destined to inherit it. From this, it is evident that the legacy of father and grandfather to son and grandson never truly perishes or fades; it is only when man opposes Heaven, or when timing and circumstance clash, that Bingyi was left without kin and Fuling without heirs. How tragic indeed!

*The Later Han Records* states: Emperor Guangwu of the Restoration was a descendant of Emperor Jing, through his son Liu Fa, the Prince Ding of Changsha. Fa begot Mai, the Marquis Jie of Chongling; Mai begot Xiongqu, the Marquis Dai; Xiongqu begot Ren, the Marquis Kao. Ren, finding the southern lands low and damp, relocated his fief to Baishui Township in Nanyang, where he settled with his clan. After Ren's death, his son Chang succeeded him. When Wang Mang usurped the throne, the state was abolished, and the title of Marquis Jie was lost. Ren's youngest son, Wai, became the Governor of Yulin. Wai begot Hui, the Commandant of Julu; Hui begot Qin, the Magistrate of Nandun. Qin married the daughter of Fan Chong of Huyang and fathered three sons: Yan, Zhong, and Xiu. Xiu had a high-bridged nose and protruding forehead, and he was diligent in farming. Xiu's aunt Yuan was married to Deng Chen of Xinye. Once, Xiu and Chen visited the diviner Cai Shaogong, who was well-versed in apocryphal prophecies. Shaogong declared, "Liu Xiu shall become the Son of Heaven." Later, Xiu ascended the throne as Emperor Guangwu of the Restoration.

*The Records of the Three Kingdoms* states: Liu Bei, the First Sovereign of Shu, was also a descendant of Emperor Jing, through his son Liu Sheng, the Prince Jing of Zhongshan. Sheng's son, Zhen, was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Lucheng Pavilion in Zhuo County in the sixth year of the Yuanshou era. He lost his title due to a gold-related offense while intoxicated and settled there. His grandfather, Xiong, and father, Hong, served in the provincial and commandery administrations for generations. Xiong was nominated as a Filial and Incorrupt candidate and later became the Prefect of Fan in Dong Commandery. The First Sovereign was orphaned young and, with his mother, made a living by selling sandals and weaving mats.

To the southeast corner of the house stood a mulberry tree by the fence, growing over five *zhang* tall. From afar, its canopy resembled a small carriage’s parasol, and passersby marveled at the tree’s extraordinary appearance, some saying it foretold the rise of a noble person. In his youth, the First Sovereign played beneath the tree with other children of his clan and declared, "I shall one day ride in a carriage adorned with feathered canopies." Later, he rose through the ranks to become Governor of Yizhou. When Cao Pi usurped the throne, the First Sovereign ascended the throne in Shu, styling himself Emperor Zhaolie.

*Recorded Notes:* Observing the circumstances of Emperor Guangwu and Emperor Zhaolie, I cannot but sigh in lament. When the Qin abolished the enfeoffment system, the Han, learning from its perils of isolation, generously enfeoffed its kinsmen, their virtue thus abundantly manifest. Yet in the blink of an eye, they were nearly exterminated—rendered not only incapable of serving as protective barriers but also stripped of their very flesh and blood. What was the reason for this? Since the founding of ancient states, only the Han arose from a commoner. At that time, fathers, brothers, sons, and nephews rode the tide of fortune’s rise, yet none had rendered even the slightest merit to the people. The Emperor himself was but a lowly post captain from Sishang. The stench of the sword that severed the serpent still lingered, and the momentum of his soaring ambition remained. How could such a legacy endure and flourish? Only after fifty or sixty years under Emperors Wen and Jing did the realm grow prosperous, rites and propriety flourish, customs transform, and the common folk become honest and sincere. By then, the Han’s primal *qi* had solidified, and its mandate had fully taken root. Only then did the sprouts of illegitimate scions wither and fade, while the blessings of loyalty and virtue extended far and wide. Thus, enfeoffment began in Changsha, and later Emperor Guangwu was peacefully enfeoffed in Zhongshan, followed by Emperor Zhaolie, who emerged from obscurity to inherit a broken mandate. Yet the descendants of Emperors Hui, Wu, Zhao, and Xuan could not match this. Had it not been for the beneficence of Emperors Wen and Jing, the Han’s rule might not have endured so steadfastly. Thus, we see that between father and son, and across dynastic transitions, benevolence and tyranny diverge sharply, as do the fortunes of continuity and severance. How can the noble-minded afford to overlook this? How can they afford to overlook this?

Empress Mingde of the Eastern Han, née Ma, was the daughter of General Fubo. In her youth, a physiognomist saw her and declared, "By fate, she shall attain great nobility." However, he added, "If she raises a younger son as if he were another’s, her strength will surpass that of his birth mother." When she became an *Imperial Consort*, her maternal aunt’s daughter, Jia, was also selected for the palace and bore Emperor Suzong. Emperor Ming, having no sons of his own, commanded her to raise the child, saying, "A child need not be one’s own; what matters is whether one’s love and care are sufficient." The Empress thereafter devoted herself wholeheartedly to his upbringing, her toil and weariness exceeding even that for her own child. Emperor Suzong, too, was deeply filial, his affection innate and sincere. The bond between mother and son remained unbroken, without the slightest discord. The Empress often lamented the scarcity of imperial heirs, her heart heavy with worry, and tirelessly recommended and promoted palace attendants, as if fearing she might not do enough. When new consorts were presented, she comforted and welcomed them, and if any gained favor, she treated them with even greater kindness.

*Recorded Notes:* During the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han, a palace scribe once bore a son. The Emperor and Lady Zhao, enraged, forced the scribe to drink poison and abandon the child. Lady Xu, another consort, also gave birth to a son, but Lady Zhao wept and refused to eat until the child was killed and buried beneath a screen. Those who miscarried due to self-inflicted harm were too numerous to count. The historian recorded all these events, leaving a grievance for ten thousand generations. I have repeatedly sighed in reflection: what kind of heart could commit such acts? Love arises from kinship, and affection from love. Though the Emperor was utterly benighted and foolish, could he not reflect that affection flows from himself, and love from his own being? How could he bear such perversity? Perhaps Heaven, weary of his debauchery, had reached its limit with Lady Zhao. Had it not been so, the imperial line would not have been severed, and future generations would have been spared the unnatural horror of patricide. Yet the principle of blessing the good and punishing the wicked remained unfulfilled. Thus, I am moved by the Empress’s conduct and record these events as a warning to all ages.

Emperor Suzong, the Filial and Illustrious Emperor Zhang, initially succeeded to the throne during the Yongping era, when the precedents of governance and official administration remained severe and exacting, with punishments tending toward the harsh. Minister of Works Chen Chong, observing that the Emperor had newly ascended, deemed it fitting to reform the lax and vulgar customs of former reigns. He thus memorialized: "Your servant has heard that the governance of the former kings was such that rewards did not exceed their due, and punishments were not indiscriminate. When compelled to choose, it is better to err on the side of excess in reward than in punishment. In the past, the strict and clear administration of justice served to awe and suppress villainy. Now that villainy has been pacified, it is imperative to temper severity with leniency. Governing is like tuning a zither or lute: if the thick strings are drawn too taut, the thin strings will snap. Your Majesty ought to exalt the Way of the former kings, sweep away the tangled and oppressive laws, lighten the weight of flogging and cudgeling to succor the multitudes, and magnify the utmost virtue to accord with the will of Heaven."

The Emperor deeply accepted Chong’s counsel and, in all matters, strove for magnanimity and generosity. Chong’s great-grandfather, Chen Xian, had served as Minister of Works during the Cheng and Ai reigns, specializing in statutes and ordinances. During the reign of Emperor Ping, when Wang Mang acted as regent and altered many Han institutions, Xian inwardly disapproved. By nature benevolent and forgiving, he often admonished his descendants: "When deliberating on the law, one should always incline toward leniency and caution, never aligning with the harshest interpretation against others." His grandfather, Qin, and father, Gong, both held office, and Gong served as Commandant of Justice in the early Jianwu era. The family had long been versed in the law. Chong, well-versed in the family profession and by nature meticulous, often spoke of the duty of ministers to be ever vigilant and cautious. From the time he entered the central administration, he dismissed his disciples and associates, devoting himself solely to public affairs. The court held him in high esteem.

Chong’s son, Zhong, inherited his father’s ethos, further emphasizing leniency and deliberation. He adjusted and refined legal procedures, establishing graded precedents to reduce the abuses of litigiousness. The chronicler observes: Chong’s words were not without foundation. By this time, the primordial qi of the Han was nearly exhausted. Had there not been above a sovereign of Zhang’s compliance and below ministers of prudence, who governed with magnanimity and succored with compassion, would the life-generating virtue of Heaven and Earth, the unbroken beauty of descendants, not have perished? Thereafter, Emperor He left few heirs, and his grandsons You, Chong, and Zeng successively ascended the throne. All were descendants of Emperor Zhang, and Chong’s line likewise continued unbroken for generations—was this not the enduring Dao? The wisdom of brothers...

From *The Book of Jin*: Xie Xuan was the nephew of Xie An. An, ever loyal to the imperial house, admonished his sons and nephews, saying: “Why should you meddle in worldly affairs? Yet if you must, strive to excel.” None of the others spoke, but Xuan replied: “It is like planting orchids and jade trees—we wish only to see them flourish in our courtyard.” An was pleased.

At the time, Fu Jian’s power was at its height, and his incursions along the frontier had shaken the court. Seeking a capable commander to defend the north, An recommended Xie Xuan for the post. Huan Chong, upon hearing this, sighed: “An defies convention to advance his kin—this is wisdom. Xuan will not betray his nomination—this is talent.” Thus, Xuan was appointed General Who Establishes Martial Power and Inspector of the Armies North of the Yangzi. From Guangling, he marched west, seized Baima, and crushed the enemy in battle.

Fu Jian personally led his forces to Xiangcheng, boasting a million men. He first dispatched Fu Rong and Murong Chui to Yingkou, while the court named Xuan Commander of the Vanguard, ordering him to resist with eighty thousand troops. Xuan sent word to Fu Rong: “You have come deep into our land and arrayed your forces along the river—surely you do not wish to fight at once. Why not withdraw slightly, allowing our officers and men room to maneuver? Then we may ride unhurriedly and observe the spectacle. Would that not be delightful?” Fu Jian’s generals urged: “We should hold the Fei River and prevent them from crossing.” But Jian said: “Simply withdraw and let them pass. Then we shall press them with our iron cavalry and annihilate them—how could we fail?” Fu Rong agreed and ordered the retreat. The troops, thrown into chaos, could not be halted.

Xuan seized the moment, leading eight thousand elite soldiers across the Fei River to engage in fierce combat. Fu Jian’s forces collapsed in rout, trampling one another, drowning in the river in numbers beyond count. The very wind and cranes seemed to cry out for the royal army. Fleeing through the wilderness, exposed to frost and famine, seven or eight out of ten perished. Later, An memorialized that the court should exploit this opportunity to reclaim the old capital. Xuan advanced his troops to Pengcheng, where the Three Wei regions all surrendered. He was appointed Commander of the Armies of Ten Provinces—Yan, Qing, Yu, Xu, Ji, You, Bing, and others—and enfeoffed as Duke of Kangle County.

The chronicler observes: Some have asked how Xie An’s victory at the Fei River compares to Zhou Yu’s triumph at Red Cliffs. An earlier scholar remarked: “Skill lies in matching the Qi, clumsiness in contending with Chu.” Thus, the difference between swift and slow, artful and artless, advance and retreat, fast and slow—this is precisely when the superior man’s careful planning bears fruit. For Wu and Wei were no match, just as Qin and Jin had long been unequal. At the time, one side spoke of meeting the enemy head-on, while the other fretted over its foundations. Without a settled strategy, how could victory be assured?

Thus, Cao Cao’s million-strong host and Fu Jian’s attempt to dam the Yellow River were blunders of Qin-like clumsiness. Zhou Yu’s advantage of a single reed’s passage and Xie An’s exploitation of the half-crossing were strokes of Qi-like skill. How apt! To plan for one’s enemy is to ensure that, whether they advance or retreat, none can withstand you. Yet the failure of the Six Dynasties to unify was Heaven’s will. By Heaven’s decree, many submitted, and the very winds, crows, mountains, clouds, and grasses seemed to conspire in ways no mortal foresight could anticipate. Even the wisdom of the Xie brothers could not surpass this, nor could the keenest observer’s judgment.

From *The History of the Southern Dynasties*: Xie Xian was the elder brother of Xie Hui. When Hui served as Right Guard of the Song court, his influence already rivaled that of the Prince of Pengcheng. Upon returning to the capital, he found his home besieged by guests, the streets choked with visitors. Xian was alarmed and said to Hui: “Your rank is not yet high, yet the people flock to you in such numbers. Our family has always been retiring, uninvolved in worldly affairs, with a circle no wider than kin and friends. Now your power overshadows the court and the realm—is this a blessing for our house?” He then separated their households, declaring: “I cannot bear to witness this.”

Later, in Pengcheng, he addressed Emperor Gaozu: “I am but a humble scholar; my father and grandfather never rose above the rank of two thousand *shi*. My brother is barely thirty, his ambitions modest, yet he has been honored above all in the court, entrusted with weighty and secret duties. When fortune exceeds its due, calamity follows—its arrival cannot be far. I beg to be demoted, that our declining house may be preserved.” When Hui later rendered meritorious service in founding the dynasty and was entrusted with great responsibilities...

Penglian grew ever more anxious and fearful. While serving as prefect, he fell ill but refused treatment, hoping for an early death. On his deathbed, he wrote to Hui: *"I have been granted this life, and by good fortune, my bones may return to the mountains whole."*

The compiler notes: *Observing Boqi’s words before and after, they suffice to shatter the delusions of later generations who cling to gain. Zhen truly lived up to the title ‘Master of the Guanzhong School.’ The hidden is most visible, the subtle most manifest—along with the admonition that ‘ten eyes watch, ten hands point’—these are all essential teachings of the Confucian school. As for the so-called ‘pure and incorruptible officials,’ how could they be compared to those who merely seek fame? Truly so. When virtue follows in unbroken succession, blessings flow far, surpassing even the Yuan clan of old. Few in later ages could match this.*

History records that Yuan Chang, a eunuch of the Eastern Han, was of the same lineage as Yuan Pu. When Pu held power at court, his family’s prestige soared, and they relied on external support. Thus, the Yuans enjoyed wealth and favor for generations, their opulence exceeding that of other noble clans—yet this was not the same.

At the time, Xun Shu of Dangtu had eight sons: Jian, Kun, Jing, Tao, Wang, Shuang, Su, and Zhuan, all renowned in their day. The people called them the "Eight Dragons." The governor of Bohai, Yuan Kang, renamed their village "Gaoyangli," comparing it to antiquity. Shuang, styled Ciming, was studious from childhood. By twelve, he had mastered the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and the *Analects*. The Grand Commandant Du Qiao praised him, saying, *"He could be a teacher to others."* Devoted to the classics, he declined all official summons.

In Yingchuan, a saying arose: *"The Eight Dragons of the Xun clan—none compare to Ciming."* Jing, styled Shucai, was gifted from youth and conducted himself with perfect propriety. When Xu Zhang of Runan asked who was the worthier between Shuang and Jing, he replied, *"Both are jade. Ciming shines outwardly, Shucai glows within."*

Later, Chen Fan, the magistrate of Taiqiu, had six sons. Ji, styled Yuanfang, was famed for his virtue. Shen, styled Jifang, matched his brother in conduct, leading to the saying: *"Yuanfang makes a brother hard to be, Jifang makes a younger brother hard to be."* Their filial devotion and harmonious household inspired admiration. Scholars of later generations revered their example, and father and sons together earned the title "Three Gentlemen."

Once, when visiting Xun Shu, Chen Fan arrived without attendants. Chen Ji drove the carriage, Chen Shen followed behind, and the young Chen Qun rode inside. Upon reaching the Xun residence, Shu’s wife answered the gate, Ciming served wine, and Wenruo, still a child, sat on his father’s lap as the sons engaged in learned discussion. At that moment, auspicious stars gathered in the sky, and the imperial astronomer reported: *"Within five hundred *li*, worthy men have convened."*

The compiler notes: *Observing the Eastern Han dynasty, at its rise, a guest star appeared; at its fall, auspicious stars shone. Can celestial omens truly be trusted? Rulers are the standard of their age, while the worthy are the heart of the people. Heaven does not obscure the radiance of virtue with mist and haze, just as the times do not extinguish the birth of sages because of comets or misfortune. Thus, the harmony of divine listening endures. Reading the ‘Ping’ poem, one understands the flourishing of the Ji lineage; seeing Yan’s tears and turning sleeves, one grasps the fall of the Zhou. Yet this was not unique to the Han’s decline.*

The *Book of Jin* records: Ji Shao, son of Ji Kang, was orphaned at ten. He served his mother with filial devotion and lived in seclusion after his father’s execution. Shan Tao recommended him to Emperor Wu, comparing him to Gao Yao and Qi Huang, urging that he be summoned. When Shao first entered Luoyang, someone remarked to Wang Rong: *"Yesterday, amid the crowd, I saw Ji Shao—tall and proud as a crane among chickens."* Rong replied: *"You have not yet seen his father."*

The President of the Secretariat, Pei Wei, also esteemed him. At the time, the young imperial relative Jia Mi held high office, and scholars like Pan Yue and Du Yu curried his favor. Mi sought Shao’s friendship, but Shao rebuffed him. When Mi was executed, Shao was enfeoffed as Marquis of Gaoyang for his integrity and promoted to Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary.

After the restoration of order, he memorialized: *"May Your Majesty never forget Jintang, may the Grand Marshal never forget Yingshang, may the Grand General never forget Huangqiao—then the seeds of chaos will have no chance to sprout."*

When the Prince of Hejian, Sima Yong, and the Prince of Chengdu, Sima Ying, marched on the capital to attack the Prince of Changsha, Sima Yi, the imperial cortege halted east of the city. Yi declared to the troops: *"Today we march west—who shall be our commander?"* The six armies cried out: *"Let the Cavalier Attendant Ji lead us!"*

Shao, seeing the emperor in peril, received the edict to proceed to the imperial presence. As the royal army suffered defeat at Dangyin, officials and guards scattered in panic. Only Shao, dignified in full court regalia, shielded the emperor with his body. Amid the clash of weapons and the rain of arrows, he fell at the emperor’s side, his blood spattering the imperial robes. The emperor mourned him deeply. When order was restored, attendants sought to wash the bloodstains, but the emperor said: *"This is the blood of Cavalier Attendant Ji—do not remove it."*

Earlier, as Shao prepared to depart, the Cavalier Attendant Qin Zhun asked: *"Today you face peril—do you have a fine horse?"* Shao replied sternly: *"If the imperial carriage is lost, my duty remains. What need have I for a swift steed?"* Those who heard him sighed in admiration.

The compiler notes: *According to the* Jin History*, the Cavalier Attendant’s loyalty was paramount—why then is it recorded under ‘filial piety between father and son’? The* Book of Changes *says: ‘Correcting the father’s errors brings peril, but ends in good fortune.’ The father, Zhongsan, was a criminal against the moral teachings of all ages; the son, the Cavalier Attendant, was the paragon of loyalty in his time. The father’s death was lighter than a goose feather and fouler than the annals of history; the son’s death was weightier than Mount Tai and brighter than the sun and moon. The father’s praise was no more than ‘a worthy companion to Gao Yao’; the son’s glory will forever be ‘a family steadfast in loyalty.’*

The young Bian was orphaned at ten, yet served his mother with filial devotion, as if by natural endowment.

The compiler notes: "To seek loyal ministers at the gates of filial sons—lord and minister, father and son share the same Dao."

Bian Kun was diligent in official duties, handling affairs with integrity, determined to uphold rectitude and oversee the age without compromise. Emperor Ming valued him above all ministers for his steadfast service. Ruan Fu often remarked that Kun never knew ease, to which Kun replied: "Among you gentlemen, who else but I clings to such narrow-mindedness, while you all esteem moral expansiveness and refined elegance?"

At the time, the sons of noble families admired Wang Cheng and Xie Kun for their unconventionality. Kun rebuked them sternly: "Nothing is more grievous than defying ritual and harming moral instruction. The collapse of the central court was precisely due to this."

When Yu Liang prepared to campaign against Su Jun, Kun vehemently opposed him, warning: "Jun commands strong troops, harbors many rogues, and presses close to the capital. Should he rebel even once, we would stumble irrecoverably. We must weigh this with deep and far-reaching consideration—haste is unwise." Liang did not heed him, and Jun indeed rose in revolt.

The court ordered Kun to oversee military affairs. He fought Jun at Lingxi, battling fiercely despite grave illness, and perished. His two sons, Miao and Xu, followed him into the fray and were slain alongside him.

After Jun’s defeat, Minister Hong Ne discussed the case: "Nothing surpasses filial piety in serving one’s parents, nor loyalty in serving one’s lord. Only through filial devotion can one offer utmost reverence and wholehearted sincerity; only through loyalty can one face danger and offer one’s life. These are the great virtues of the Three Bonds, the highest conduct of minister and child. Kun served three reigns, offering counsel and support. When the realm faced peril, he staked his life upon it. When the traitor Jun rebelled, he exerted all his strength to suppress him, standing in the path of arrows and blades, confronting the enemy’s vanguard twice. Father and sons perished together—one might say he ruined his family for the state, held fast to death in devoted service. Above, he matched Xu Mu; below, he equaled Ji Shao."

Thus, he was posthumously appointed Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary, General of the Chariot and Cavalry, and granted the privilege of establishing an office with the full ceremonial of the Three Dukes. The imperial decree declared: "For his loyalty and steadfastness, offer a grand sacrifice." His son Tai was posthumously named Gentleman Cavalier Attendant, and Xu, Attendant-in-Ordinary of the Imperial Carriage. His wife, Lady Pei, embraced his corpse and wept: "A father loyal to his lord, sons filial to their father—what regret could there be?"

The recluse Zhai Tang also said: "A father dies for his lord, sons die for their father—here, the Dao of loyalty and filial piety converges in one household."

The compiler notes: "Observing the two Jin dynasties, one finds the Bian father and sons—truly outstanding, rising above their generation. When Su Jun rebelled, Liang summoned him, and Liang died for it—this was fitting. Yet Kun, clearly foreseeing the disaster, still chose death. Why? The pursuit of reputation and the commitment to truth stand worlds apart.

The followers of Wang and Xie pursued fame: their self-regard was boundless. Those who chase reputation polish their demeanor and refine their discourse; when words align, they exult, but when crisis comes, they falter. They prize lofty detachment, and others see them as no different from the common run—content with what is acceptable.

Those who pursue truth hold fast to unyielding integrity and steadfast principles. Confronted with affairs, they regard wrongdoing as a personal enemy; facing peril, they refuse to shrink, even at the brink of ruin. They take resolute action as their constant resolve, and others defer to them, unaware of what they cannot endure. Thus, they do not cease until death.

Yet in dying to perfect their humanity, they illuminate their unblemished integrity. The sons, too, sought and attained humanity—loyalty and filial piety preserved their names whole. They will endure as long as heaven and earth, shine as brightly as the sun and moon. How do they compare to those 'refined gentlemen'? A thousand, ten thousand times greater!

Alas! They were truly humane."

In Tao Qian’s *"Letter to My Sons Yan, Si, Fen, and Chan"*:

To Yan, Si, Fen, and Chan:

Heaven and earth bestow life, and all who are born must die. From ancient times, even the wise and sagely—who could escape this fate? As Zixia said: *"Life and death are decreed by fate; wealth and honor rest with Heaven."* These words came from one of the Four Companions, who received the Master’s teachings firsthand. Does not this saying imply that success and failure cannot be recklessly sought, nor longevity or early death arbitrarily requested?

I am now past fifty. From youth, I have known hardship and poverty, often driven to wander east and west to sustain my family. My nature is unyielding, my talents crude, and I have clashed with the world at every turn. Knowing my own limits, I feared bringing trouble upon myself, so I resigned from office, sparing you from hunger and cold in your youth. Yet I have often recalled the words of Ruzhong’s wise wife: *"Wrapped in rags, how can I warm my sons?"* This, too, is my plight. But what grieves me most is the absence of a caring mother like Lady Mi for my two younger brothers. Bearing this sorrow, I feel only deep shame within.

In my youth, I studied the zither and books, finding solace in quietude. When I opened a scroll and grasped its meaning, I would forget to eat. Seeing trees cast their intertwined shade, hearing birds change their songs with the seasons, I would rejoice as if blessed. I once said that in the fifth or sixth month, lying beneath the north window when a cool breeze briefly arose, I felt like a man of the era of Fuxi. My understanding was shallow, my knowledge scant—I thought such words could endure. Yet time fleets, and with it, my strength and skill have faded. Looking back now, how distant and faint those days seem.

Since falling ill, I have grown increasingly frail. Though relatives and old friends have not abandoned me, sending medicines and remedies, I fear my allotted time is nearly spent. You are still young, and our family is poor. You toil daily with firewood and water—when will this end? The thought of it weighs on my heart like a burning coal, beyond words.

Though you share the same parents, remember the truth that *"all within the four seas are brothers."* When Bao Shu and Guan Zhong divided their wealth, they harbored no suspicion; when Gui Sheng and Wu Ju met on the road, they spread rushes to sit and reminisce. From ruin, they built success; from loss, they achieved great deeds. If even strangers can do this, how much more should those born of the same father?

Han Yuanchang of Yingchuan, a renowned scholar of the late Han, served as a high official and lived to eighty. His brothers lived together until their teeth fell out. Fan Zhichun of Jibei, a man of exemplary conduct in the Jin dynasty, shared wealth with seven generations of his family, and no one bore resentment. As the *Book of Songs* says: *"Like gazing up at a lofty mountain, like following a shining path."* Though I cannot match such virtue, my heart aspires to it.

Beware, my words end here.

It is recorded: In the human Dao, the Three Bonds stand foremost. Jingjie [Tao Yuanming] lived alone, yet nothing in his conduct was amiss. He forgot words in pursuit of true meaning and entrusted his fate to the great transformation, nearly attaining unity with the Dao.

Some may suspect this elder’s meticulous instructions were an excessive concern for what comes after death—this is far from the case. The bond between father and child is of heavenly nature; how could it be abandoned? Since the dawn of writing, this innate sincerity has remained unchanging. Even a thousand years later, one can imagine his boundless kindness, his meticulous care, his profound humanity and virtue—far beyond mere considerations of honor or disgrace, bitterness or joy. How can those who hide in obscurity, act strangely, and purify themselves at the cost of great human relationships be spoken of in the same breath?

Ku Yin, in his youth, stood firm with unyielding integrity. When he was just over ten, his father passed away, and his weeping moved all who heard it to tears. He served his mother with filial devotion. When he observed mourning, his grief exceeded ritual propriety. Once, when tasting food, he found its flavor agreeable and, ashamed, cast it aside. He lived in poverty with Han Kangbo, the Grand Master of Ceremonies. Kangbo’s mother, the sister of Yin Hao, was a wise and virtuous woman. Whenever she heard Yin’s weeping, she would set down her meal and chopsticks, moved to tears. Later, she said to Kangbo: *"If you ever hold the power of appointment, you must promote men like this."* When Kangbo became Minister of Personnel, Yin ascended through the ranks of pure office.

It is recorded: Those who drink from the spring of responsibility without changing their hearts do so to establish themselves, practice the Dao, and glorify their names for posterity—to honor their parents, not merely for their own sake. Had he not stood firm from youth, mourning his parents with such devotion, how could he have remained so steadfast? His grief exceeding ritual had its reasons. Kangbo’s discernment and Han’s mother’s insight into character—were they not of one mind, even sharing the same neighborhood? This embodies the ancient ideal of choosing worthy neighbors, a beauty indeed.

It is recorded in *The Book of Wei*: Gao Yun, Duke of Xianyang and Grand Master of Splendor, served five emperors, entering and leaving the Three Departments for over fifty years without ever incurring blame. Benevolent, forgiving, simple, and serene, though he held high office, his heart remained as humble as a commoner. He held books to read day and night without cease. He tirelessly taught others goodness, ever gentle and patient, cherishing both the new and the old, leaving none behind.

As General of Tasked Forces in the East and Governor of Huaizhou, he toured his jurisdiction in the autumn months, inquiring after the people’s hardships. Arriving at Zhaoxian County, he saw that the temple of the Duke of Shao lay in ruins, unbuilt, and said: “The virtue of the Duke of Shao, left unhonored and without ritual—what hope is there for those who do good?” He then memorialized the throne to have it repaired. At that time, nearing ninety years of age, he exhorted the people to study and cultivate their livelihoods, and his transformative influence spread widely.

Later, during the Zhengguang era, the Palace Gentleman of the Secretariat, Chang Jing, reflecting on Yun’s legacy, led the elders of the commandery to establish a shrine for him south of Yewang, erecting a stele to record his virtue.

When the Emperor Shizu pacified Qing and Qi, he relocated their eminent clans to Dai. At that time, many scholars and gentry had been displaced and arrived from afar, most suffering from hunger and cold, and many were his relatives by marriage. Yun distributed his wealth and exhausted his property to provide for them, offering relief and consolation with thorough care. All were moved by his benevolence and generosity.

Yun’s mother, in her advanced years, once said to others: “When my son served in the Secretariat, he performed hidden acts of virtue, saving and aiding lives. If his yang retribution is not amiss, I should live to a hundred.” In the end, she indeed passed away at the age of ninety-eight.

Recorded thus:

Life and death are indeed matters of great weight. Gao Bogong, free from doubt or hesitation, saw both mother and son ultimately attain long life. Those who understand destiny—why must they toil restlessly? Yet even a low-ranking official, if he harbors a heart that cherishes all things and aids others in some small way, is no different from one who served in the Secretariat. He served five emperors, moving in and out of the Three Departments for over fifty years—unlike the "Old Man of Everlasting Joy," and thus the gentleman did not reject him.

*The Old Tang History* records: In the twelfth month of the twentieth year of the Zhenguan era, the Emperor said to Changsun Wuji and others, "Today is my birthday. The world celebrates with joy, but in such moments, sorrow often arises. Now I rule all under heaven and possess the four seas, yet I can never again receive my parents’ affection at my knees. This is why Zilu bore the regret of carrying rice for his parents." He then recited the *Book of Songs*: *"When I think of my parents’ toil in raising me, how can I turn their days of labor into mere feasting and pleasure?"* Tears streamed down his face, and all around him were moved to grief.

Recorded thus: These words of Taizong reveal the insight of a truly enlightened ruler. Though "boundless longevity" has been the prayer of emperors past and present, it is the duty of ministers and sons to fulfill their roles with devotion. If one were to place oneself in such a position, how could empty celebrations bring joy when the heart is weighed down by sorrow? This shows Taizong’s innate goodness. Had he cultivated it with the learning of sages, how could Yao and Shun have been beyond his reach?

Di Renjie once spoke to Empress Wu with measured words: "Between aunt and nephew, and mother and son—which bond is closer? If Your Majesty enthrones your son, then for ten thousand generations after, he will be enshrined in the ancestral temple, ensuring an unbroken line of succession. But if you enthrone your nephew, it has never been heard that a nephew, as emperor, would offer sacrifices to his aunt in the temple." The Empress’s heart stirred slightly, and she summoned the Prince of Luling to the imperial court. In the ninth month, she named him Crown Prince.

Recorded thus: The integrity of Duke Liang was rooted in the utmost principles of Heavenly reason and human relations. Yet his approach was not to impose but to illuminate what was already clear and dispel what was obscured. The bond between father and son is the foundation of natural affection, while that between aunt and nephew is a distant tie of different surnames. Even tigers and wolves, fierce as they are, know the intimacy of parent and child—so long as their lusts have not reached their extreme. It is only when human desires run rampant that the original heart becomes obstructed. Once the original heart is blocked, alien influences take hold. Though one may appear human in form, who is truly without self-interest? The mere mention of offering sacrifices to an aunt in the temple was enough to stir the Empress’s unfulfilled maternal heart. In discussing affairs of state, his words possessed the power to turn the tide of Heaven—such was Duke Liang.

Early in his career, when Duke Liang served as Legal Clerk of Bingzhou, his parents resided in Heyang. One day, as he ascended Mount Taihang, he turned back and saw a solitary white cloud drifting above. He said to his attendants, "My parents’ home lies beneath it," and gazed longingly for some time. Only when the cloud moved on did he depart. Those around him were deeply moved.

Recorded thus: The world knew of Duke Liang’s exemplary conduct, but few knew of his filial piety. As the saying goes: *"One who is filial to his parents can transfer that loyalty to his lord."* From this, we understand that a minister’s failure to remonstrate does not stem from the impossibility of persuasion but from the lack of resolve in his own conduct. Nor does the difficulty of accomplishing great deeds lie in external challenges but in the insufficiency of sincerity.

Li Jingye, on the other hand, rose in rebellion with his father’s corpse still unburied, lamenting only that *"the soil on his grave is not yet dry"* and *"where now is the six-foot orphan?"*—how far had he strayed from the path? His cause was doomed to fail.

Li Chen lost his father in childhood and served his mother with utmost filial devotion. Bold and talented, he would don embroidered robes and a brocade cap before battle, leading the charge to inspire his troops. When Zhu Ci occupied the capital and Li Huaiguang plotted treachery, Chen addressed his assembled forces: "The nation faces endless crises, and rebellions arise one after another. The imperial carriage has fled west, leaving Guanzhong without a ruler. We have all received the state’s grace—when danger arises, to die for loyalty is the duty of a minister and subject. If we cannot slay the traitors at such a time, we are no heroes." He then declared, "The Wei Bridge spans a great river, cutting off the enemy’s head and tail. Let us join forces, seize the advantage, and advance to restore the great enterprise and achieve an unparalleled feat. What say you?" The troops wept and replied, "We follow your command."

When they reached the Tonghua Gate, Chen said, "If we first secure the markets and alleys, the narrow streets will be filled with residents. Should the enemy set ambushes and engage in close combat, the people will panic and scatter—this is no strategy. The enemy’s main forces are in the palace gardens. If we strike at their heart from the gardens, they will have no time to flee. Thus, the palaces will be secured, the markets undisturbed, and the people unharmed—this is the best plan." The generals agreed. That night, they breached the garden wall in over two hundred places, dividing their forces to advance simultaneously. The battle cries shook the earth, and they pressed forward relentlessly, driving the enemy to Baihua. Zhu Ci and Yao Lingyan fled in disarray.

Chen’s army entered the capital and encamped before the Hall of Manifest Origin. He issued orders: "The people of Chang’an have long suffered under the rebels. If we cause even the slightest alarm, it would betray the righteousness of punishing the guilty and comforting the people. Proclaim to all: let the residents remain in peace, and not a single blade of grass shall be harmed." The people rejoiced, and even those from distant regions did not realize the city had been retaken until the official report arrived. The Emperor declared: "In ancient times, generals who restored capitals by force were not uncommon. But to spare the ancestral temples, leave the markets untouched, and ensure the people of Chang’an never saw the banners of war—such a feat has not been seen since the Three Dynasties. Heaven raised Li Chen for the sake of the state and its people, not for me alone."

Later, when his son Li Su became commander, he once launched a night attack in a snowstorm to defeat Wu Yuanji, halting at the rebel’s outer residence. When the officials of Cai reported the city’s fall, Yuanji refused to believe it—until he heard Su’s troops issuing commands. Only then did his officers say, "How did the eunuch reach this point?"

Then he drove his retinue to the inner city to resist, while Yuanji on the city walls begged for mercy. They lowered him by ladder and sent him in a caged cart to the capital. Over twenty thousand troops from Shen and Guang Prefectures and various garrisons surrendered in succession. From the moment Yuanji was captured, not a single life was taken; all who had served in his headquarters, kitchens, or stables were restored to their posts. The army encamped in the polo field to await Pei Du.

Like Chen’s earlier triumph, this feat resounded with equal renown. The father and son’s great merit defies comparison.

Recorded: When Tang of Shang campaigned against Ge, his invincible host practiced the governance of a true king, and the people knew not war—so natural was their submission. The Chens’ rescue of Tang, however, stemmed a deluge with a cracked vessel; that markets remained unchanged bespeaks the difficulty of quelling rebellion. Had the court heeded the clamorous counsel of generals, streets would have been thrown into chaos, and no sweeping victory achieved. Had it trusted the words of military clerks and executed Li You, no such monumental success would have followed. Thus it is said: “Only Xiping has such a son; only I have such ministers.” Between father and son, the benefits were boundless.

The historian praises Li Guangbi: born to a frontier lineage, steadfast and resolute, he rose to command amid upheaval, outmaneuvering enemies and securing victory. His rewards and punishments were just, his troops fiercely loyal—unmistakably the bearing of an ancient great general. Yet he observed full mourning for his father, never entering his wife’s chambers, and served his stepmother with utmost filial piety, setting him apart from common warriors.

It is often said of Duke Duan of Jin that he was merely a soldier who seized fame through reckless bravery—this is untrue. Duan Xiushi was solemn and restrained, always walking with head bowed and hands clasped, his speech and manner unassuming. He never met others with harshness, and people took him for a scholar. At six, when his mother fell ill, he refused even a spoonful of water for seven days, eating only when her condition improved—earning the title of “Filial Child.” Again, when Li Xun and his brother Jian sojourned in Jingzhou, their mother cherished Jian’s devotion, saying, “When Jian urges me to eat, I am always sated; when he administers medicine, I feel it will surely work.” The villagers emulated him, bringing disputes to Jian rather than the magistrate. Emperor Dezong promoted him from Right Reminder and Hanlin Academician to Prefect of Lizhou, then summoned him as Vice Minister of Justice, posthumously honoring him as Minister of Works.

Recorded: Xue Fang observed that those who practice filial piety and kindness foster harmonious qi. Thus, whether in frontier legacies, martial ranks, or humble wanderers, all who established merit, integrity, or renown did so from this foundation. How much more so for nobles, the esteemed of the Central Kingdom, or the learned gentry—need one even speak of it? Such histories serve the world’s teachings, and records cannot be omitted.

*Hongdao Record*, Volume 5, ends.
(Note: “Song” emended to “family” per context.)

*Hongdao Record*, Volume 6: Benevolence.

**Filial and Parental Benevolence**

From *The History of the Song*: During the ninth year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era of Emperor Zhenzong (1016), on the first day of the fifth month, a prince was born to Consort Li of the rear palace. Zhou Qi, then Prefect of Kaifeng, was reporting on affairs when the emperor said, “Do you know of my joy?” Qi replied, “I do not.” The emperor said, “I have just had a son.” He then entered the inner palace, emerged with gold coins in his sleeve, and scattered them as gifts to Qi.

Consort Li, a native of Hangzhou, had initially entered the palace to serve Consort Liu. She was solemn and reticent, and the emperor favored her, appointing her as Lady of the Court. Once with child, she accompanied the emperor to Qitai Terrace, where her jade hairpin fell. The emperor secretly divined that if the pin remained unbroken, she would bear a son. When attendants retrieved it, the pin was undamaged. The emperor rejoiced, and soon after, she indeed gave birth to a son—this was Emperor Renzong.

**Recorded:** The founding and destiny of the entire Song dynasty hinged upon this event. Though the dynasty was established amid haste and turmoil, with no dissent at the time, later generations would not have readily accepted it. Yet through three reigns, Renzong’s forty-two-year rule—marked by profound benevolence and deep virtue, which permeated flesh and bone—further illuminated the grandeur of his ancestors’ legacy and secured the legitimacy of imperial succession. Even a hundred generations later, the virtuous man cannot but feel a surge of joy and gratitude at the birth of such a benevolent ruler.

**Further Recorded:** The imperial consort from Hangzhou gave birth to Renzong. Now, our Empress Dowager Shou’an, also from Hangzhou, bore Emperor Xingsheng. Their dragon’s ascent and phoenix’s dance, the mountains and rivers bearing witness—this is no mere coincidence. And if five hundred years later another true sovereign arises, it will be further proof of this pattern.

In the second year of Jingyou (1035), Emperor Renzong adopted Zongshi, son of Prince Yunrang of Runan, and raised him in the palace. Yunrang was a grandson of Emperor Taizong, his father being Prince Shang, Yuanyuan. As the emperor had no heir, he took Zongshi, then four years old, and commanded the empress to foster him.

**Recorded:** At the time, the emperor had reigned for thirteen years and was only twenty-six, while Empress Cao had been installed for little over a year. Why then adopt another’s son to raise in the palace? This is why, a hundred generations later, the emperor is praised as benevolent and the empress as virtuous. Of all the most just and magnanimous acts of antiquity, none surpasses the matter of succession. Even among commoners with modest wealth, men cling to hope and hesitate to openly raise a brother’s son if forced to do so. How much more so for the vastness of the realm, the weight of ancestral legacy, the trust of the divine mandate, and the destiny of dynastic succession? Had the emperor’s heart not been purely attuned to the impartiality of great principle, free of even a trace of selfish desire, who could have acted without entanglement?

If later sovereigns follow the example of Renzong and Empress Cao—though their heirs may not be of their own blood—posterity will still hail them as sagely, as founders of a lasting line, their descendants enduring unbroken. But if even a hint of selfishness intrudes, if they do not regard the realm as belonging to all but instead conceal the truth of succession, then in a moment of crisis, they may fail to act with the same luminous righteousness as Renzong of the Song.

**Or one might ask:** If the emperor was so benevolent, why did he have no heir of his own? The answer lies in the *Book of Changes*: “He washes his hands but does not present the offering—yet his countenance is bright and clear.” One who purifies heart and mind to govern the realm may not see immediate signs of response, yet all under heaven and for all time will revere his virtue. What harm, then, in whether the offering is made or not?

Thus, the noble man may strive to perpetuate good deeds, but cannot ensure his descendants will continue them; he may devote himself to cultivating virtue that endures, but cannot guarantee his legacy will persist. What lies within human power is possible; what does not is the domain of Heaven. That which is done without being done—that is Heaven. That which arrives without being summoned—that is fate. Such is the meaning here.

In the first year of Jianyan (1127), on the gengyin day of the fifth month, Prince Kang ascended the throne as emperor. Earlier, Empress Dowager Yuanxiao had sent a handwritten decree to announce the news throughout the realm. Its gist was this: For two hundred years, the people knew no war; through nine reigns, no ruler lacked virtue. Though the imperial clan faced the calamity of the Jingkang era, the hearts of all under heaven turned in loyalty. Thus, Heaven favored a worthy prince to restore the old order—just as the Han, after ten generations of hardship, saw Guangwu’s revival, and of Duke Xian’s nine sons, only Chong’er remained. This is the will of Heaven, not the design of man.

Zong Ze advised that Nanjing was the founding ground of Emperor Taizu and urged the emperor to proceed there. The decision was made to go to Yingtian Prefecture, where an altar was erected to the left of the prefectural gate. The prince ascended the altar to receive the mandate. On that day, Empress Dowager Yuanxiao withdrew the palace screen in the Eastern Capital.

**Recorded:** Emperors Yuan of Jin, Suzong of Tang, and Gaozong of Song all established themselves as rulers. Yet the decree of Empress Dowager Yuanxiao was clear and unequivocal—Heaven thus granted an aged remnant to the dynasty. Compared to the two captured emperors, this was far more blameless in terms of benevolent succession.

At that time, the Three Bonds were overturned, the Two Modes nearly extinguished. Not only was the great enterprise of one founder and eight ancestors lost, but the very legitimacy of the Central Kingdom since ancient times hung by a thread. Hu Mingsheng’s memorial was, in my view, excessive.

Emperor Xiaozong was the seventh-generation descendant of Emperor Taizu. Prince De of Qin begot Duke Ying of Guo, Weixian; Weixian begot Marquis Xinxing, Congyu; Congyu begot Marquis Huayin, Shijiang; Shijiang begot Duke Qing of Guo, Linggui; Linggui begot Zhuan, Prince Xiu. His consort, Lady Zhang, gave birth to the emperor in the fourth year of Jianyan (1127), on the wuyin day of the tenth month, at the official residence in Qingshanfan, Xiuzhou.

When Crown Prince Yuanyi passed away and Emperor Gaozong had no heir, Empress Dowager Zhaoci Shengxian, returning from Jiangxi, privately advised him. The Right Chief Councilor Fan Zongyin knelt to plead, and Lou Renliang, Vice Censor-in-Chief, submitted a memorial urging the matter.

Emperor Gaozong, greatly enlightened, declared: "Taizu established the realm through divine martial prowess, yet his descendants could not inherit it. Buffeted by tumultuous times, they have scattered in pitiful decline. If We do not follow the example of Emperor Renzong for the sake of the realm, how shall We console the spirits in heaven?" Thereupon, he issued an edict to select from Taizu’s descendants. In the fifth month of the second year of Shaoxing (1132), the chosen heir was raised within the palace. Thirty-two years later, he was established as Crown Prince, and on the *yihai* day ascended the imperial throne as Emperor Xiaozong.

Emperor Lizong was likewise a tenth-generation descendant of Taizu. His father, Xi Lu, was posthumously enfeoffed as Prince Rong; his mother, Lady Quan, gave birth to him on the *guihai* day of the first month of the first year of Kaixi (1205) at the Hongqiao residence in Shaoxing. In the thirteenth year of Jiading under Emperor Ningzong, when Crown Prince Jingxian passed away without issue, Taizu’s grandsons aged fifteen and above were selected for education, following the precedent of Gaozong’s choice of the Princes of Pu’an and Enping. Alongside Prince Ji, they were raised within the palace. The emperor was of solemn and reticent disposition, pure and studious by nature. Each morning at court, while others chattered and laughed as they awaited the dawn audience, he alone remained dignified, earning reverence from all who beheld him. As Prince Ji had clashed with the Chancellor Shi Miyuan, the latter turned his favor toward the emperor. On the *bingxu* day of the eighth month in the seventeenth year (1224), as Ningzong’s health declined, he was named Crown Prince. The next day, the *dingyou*, he succeeded to the imperial throne as Emperor Lizong.

A record observes: Examining the affairs of the Southern Song, one cannot but marvel at the workings of Heaven’s will. Since Gaozong’s enthronement, he forgot the enmity of his father and elder brother—who did not resent this, who did not grieve? Yet unbeknownst to all, Heaven’s design was already in motion, as though purging for Taizu’s sake. Consider this: Emperor Huizong had thirty-one sons, yet in an instant, all perished. Could Heaven have acted without purpose? Had the two emperors returned from the northern deserts, Huizong would not yet have aged, Qinzong would have been in his prime, and their progeny would have been boundless. Even if Gaozong and Ningzong had left no heirs, how could Xiaozong and Lizong have risen? In the end, the throne passed through six emperors for a hundred and fifty years, rivaling the Northern Song in duration. Herein lies the proof of Heaven’s just retribution. Some, failing to grasp these principles, absurdly claim oblivion or even proclaim the reincarnation of Taizu. Alas!

Alas, how could such claims be believed? Alas, how could they be believed?

Cao Wei-Hui Wang’s father, Yun, gave birth to Bin. In his infancy, Yun arrayed a hundred playthings before the child to observe his choices. Bin seized a halberd in his left hand and ritual vessels in his right, then swiftly took up a seal, paying no heed to the rest. Those present marveled at this.

In adulthood, he became a great general and led the campaign against Jiangnan. With each delay of the army, he hoped Li Yu would submit, sending envoys to advise him: “The situation being as it is, what is truly to be cherished is the city’s people. If you surrender, it will be the wisest course.”

As the city neared capture, Bin suddenly claimed illness and ceased attending to affairs. All the generals came to inquire after him. Bin said: “My illness cannot be cured by medicine or stone needles. Only if you gentlemen sincerely swear that on the day the city falls, not a single life will be taken without cause, will I recover.” The generals agreed and together burned incense to take the oath.

Thereupon, the Lord of Tang led his ministers to surrender. Bin consoled and reassured them, treating them with the rites due to guests. From the army’s departure to its triumphant return, not a single person was killed, and Jiangnan was thus preserved intact.

Bin had seven sons. Can and Zhang became renowned generals. Li married the daughter of Prince Qin, Princess Juping. Fa rose to the rank of *Zhaoxuan* Envoy. Yi served as Vice Director of the Bureau of Sacrifices. Xun became *Shu Shangge Men* Envoy. Zong was appointed Vice *Xishang He Men* Envoy and concurrently Military Commissioner of Zhenhai. Yi’s daughter became Empress Cisheng Guangxian.

Later, Yun was posthumously enfeoffed as Prince Wei, Bin as Prince Han, and Yi as Prince Wu. All their descendants rose to prominence, none falling short.

The record states: The *Mu Shi* speaks of “six generations, seven generations”—this is the sage’s use of force. The *Tai Shi* speaks of “one virtue, one heart”—this is the sage’s foundation for meritorious achievement. Warfare is not to be resorted to lightly. If matters can be resolved without harm, yet one still inflicts suffering upon the people to satisfy one’s ambitions, this not only defies the Dao of Heaven but invites retribution in human affairs. Witness the fates of Qin and Xiang in ancient times, or Han and Quan in more recent days.

Men are not ghosts—retribution comes swiftly, cutting off descendants and leaving no posterity. How then could their fathers, grandfathers, children, and grandchildren enjoy full prosperity across the entire clan? Moreover, Jiangnan was not guilty; it was merely that "beside one’s own sleeping mat, another’s snoring could not be tolerated"—such an approach was hardly that of a righteous army. Had it not been for a resolve to refrain from killing, one would still be treading the path of demons, following in their nightmares.

Bin’s aspirations were lofty and far-reaching, not merely calculating future outcomes before acting. Minister Wang Wenzheng—his father, Ku, having served as Minister of War and Vice Minister of the Board of War—rose to prominence through his literary achievements during the Han and Zhou dynasties. Entering the Song, he served Emperors Taizu and Taizong as a distinguished minister. He once advised Du Chongwei against rebelling against the Han, thwarted Lu Duoxun’s scheme to harm Zhao Pu, and vouched with his entire family for Fu Yanjing’s innocence. The world often praised his hidden virtue. You planted three pagoda trees in his courtyard, declaring, "My descendants will surely hold the rank of the Three Dukes." This was the aspiration that guided him.

His youngest son, Yi, was quiet, studious, and gifted in literature. You esteemed him, saying, "This child will rise to the position of chief minister." Initially, You, renowned for his long tenure in drafting imperial decrees, remarked that Yi would succeed him within a decade—a sentiment widely admired. Qian Ruoshui, known for his discernment of character, saw Dan and said, "He is truly a prime minister in the making." When serving alongside him, he often remarked, "Master Wang soars above the clouds and stands tall among the peaks—a pillar of the state, his nobility boundless, beyond my reach." Li Hang, a contemporary, also revered him as a man of great promise. The Emperor, who held Dan in high regard, declared, "The one who will bring great peace to my reign is surely this man."

The record states: Observing the obscure teachings of Minister Sima, one understands what is meant by hidden virtue. The principles of Heaven are luminous. Only when one internalizes them, embodies them, and perceives them as invisible and inaudible—this is what is called obscurity. Yet how could such virtue be accumulated in a single day? Speaking of it now: the capacity for magnanimity—without it, one becomes impatient, narrow, and constrained. Would I willingly endure even a moment of such a state? Thus, magnanimity can accumulate hidden virtue. The virtue of benevolence—without it, one becomes cruel, envious, and harsh. Would I willingly depart from it even for an instant? Thus, benevolence can accumulate hidden virtue. The impartiality of a public-minded heart—without it, one becomes biased, selfish, and crooked. Would I willingly stray from it even for a breath? Thus, impartiality can accumulate hidden virtue. The principle of forbearance—without it, one becomes nitpicking and fault-finding. Would I willingly harbor even a single such thought? Thus, forbearance can accumulate hidden virtue. This is not the same as the Buddhists’ empty obscurity and extinction.

Fan Wenzheng had four sons: Chunyou, Chunren, Chunli, and Chunzui. Chunyou was filial to his parents, never leaving their side. Though he did not pursue the imperial examinations, he was appointed Acting Director of the Bureau of Palace Construction through hereditary privilege. Finding the post unsuited to his interests, he resigned and followed his father to Deng. Chunren passed the imperial examinations but, due to his parents’ distant location, did not take office, saying, "How could I value official salary over being near my parents?" After Zhongyan’s death, he began his official career, once remarking, "All my life, I have learned but two words—loyalty and forbearance—and they have never been exhausted." In his governance, dealings with colleagues, and care for his clan, he never strayed from these principles for even a moment. He often admonished his descendants: "Even the dullest person is clear when criticizing others, while even the wise become muddled when judging themselves. If one could use the rigor applied to others to examine oneself, and the forbearance applied to oneself to treat others, one would have no fear of failing to reach the realm of the sages." He also said, "The Six Classics are the deeds of the sages. To know a single word is to practice it. One must uphold this even in haste or adversity—this is what it means to be a person of action."

Zhongyan once remarked of his sons: Chunren embodied his loyalty, Chunli his tranquility, and Chunzui his breadth. Who knows a child better than their father?

The record states: The saying goes, "The benevolent have descendants"—how could one abandon this? Wenzheng began as a solitary orphan, a poor scholar of unyielding integrity. Yet in later years, he became a general and minister, and his sons all achieved renown. Had this not been the guiding principle of his heart, how could it have differed so greatly from others? To set aside personal joy and sorrow is the nature of one man. To rejoice with the world and grieve with the world—even kings must do this, let alone their ministers. Loyalty and forbearance are the essence of self-cultivation. To extend one’s heart to all things without conflict—even sages must do this, let alone scholars. This is why some of his sons inherited his loyalty, others his tranquility, and others his breadth. Alas! Observing what they inherited reveals that their achievements were no accident.

Minister Han Zhongxian had eight sons: Gang, Zong, Feng, Yi, Wei, Zhen, Wei, and Mian. Feng, Wei, and Zhen all held high office, each excelling in different virtues—Feng in harmony, Wei in uprightness, and Zhen in strictness. Yi was steadfast and solemn in character, governing his household with strict discipline. Even in leisure, he never appeared idle. Whenever he saw memorials from the circuits criticizing minor faults of officials, his expression would darken, and he would say, "In this era of great peace, the Sage Emperor’s heart desires that even insects and plants find their proper place. Those in office aspire to be high ministers, or at least attendants or officials in the capital or provinces. How could we confine them in such a flourishing age?"

When Wei served as Vice Director of the Chancellery, the censor Zhang Shunmin was dismissed for speaking out. Wang Yansou defended him, and Wei secretly sent a letter to the emperor, explaining that officials exchanging letters to encourage one another in good conduct was a collective effort for virtue, posing no harm to governance. To nitpick such matters would be of no benefit to state affairs. Thus, the matter was dropped.

The Record states: Observing the words of Han Zhongxian, though separated by eras, they align with the same path as Yuan Shaogong. How could a noble person disregard them? Yet if one does not serve as a censor or hold the responsibility of selecting officials, one may decline such duties. If, however, one assumes such a role and can hold these principles in heart, it would not only invigorate the nation’s vital *qi* but also augment one’s own blessings and posterity—how admirable this would be.

It is said: In one’s own heart, to seek faults where none exist, to find affairs where none occur, to discern intentions where none are present—this is not the result of deep reflection. It is said: Feng Tong, Wei Zheng, Shen Zhen, and Yi Fang—even a single father’s several sons cannot be entirely alike, let alone the vastness of the Four Seas. If one does not merely select the easy path like a mother hen but manifests virtue in the world, one may stand without shame.

Master Xu of Jiexiao, renowned for filial piety, was born with innate devotion. At three, his father died, and each dawn he sought him with profound sorrow. Upon reading the *Classic of Filial Piety*, his tears would not cease. He served his mother with utmost devotion, dressing formally morning and night to pay respects. When he journeyed to the capital for examinations, he could not bear to leave his parents. As his father’s name contained the character for "stone," he avoided all stone vessels throughout his life; when he encountered stones while walking, he would stop in grief, unable to step upon them.

When his mother passed, he refused all food and drink for seven days, weeping until he vomited blood. He built a hut by her grave and mourned for three years, sleeping on rough straw and resting his head on clods of earth, never removing his mourning garments. On snowy nights, he would prostrate himself by the grave, his sobs unceasing. When Academician Lü Feng passed by his hut and heard his lament, he too was moved to tears. Sweet dew descended upon the burial site, and two branches of a cypress miraculously intertwined.

After the mourning period, he did not replace the mourning mats or furnishings, continuing his daily routines as before. The prefecture reported his conduct, and the court bestowed grain and silk upon him. In the early Yuanyou era, high officials jointly memorialized: "He is famed for filial devotion in serving his parents, integrity in his village, and virtue and learning renowned in the east." Thus, he was appointed Professor of Chuzhou. He instructed his students: "If you wish to be noble persons yet must exert your strength and spend your wealth, and still do not act, this may be excusable. But if it costs neither your strength nor your wealth, why not be noble? If your village despises you and your parents disdain you, and you still do not act, this may be excusable. But if your village honors you and your parents desire it, why not be noble?"

He further said: "Speak of what is good, act upon what is good, contemplate what is good—those who do so yet fail to become noble persons have never existed. Speak of what is not good, act upon what is not good, contemplate what is not good—those who do so yet fail to become petty persons have never existed." Those who heard him listened with reverence and respect.

The Record states: Observing the flourishing and accumulating prosperity of the Sacred Song Dynasty, one understands the origin of such filial devotion. While one person’s filial piety may arise from innate nature, it may not extend to the entire world. Only when all strive to do good can the generations beneath one’s knees rely upon it. Extending this to the world, how could there fail to be noble conduct among all? The accumulation of such intent reaches its height here.

As for lifelong avoidance of stone vessels and never removing mourning garments, these are acts one can achieve through effort. Yue Fei’s filial nature was innate. When his mother, née Yao, was giving birth, a great bird circled and cried above the house, so he was named accordingly. Before he was a month old, the Yellow River breached its banks, and the waters of Neihuang surged violently. His mother held him in a jar, and the waves carried them to shore, where they were saved—people marveled at this.

As he grew, he bore a resolute spirit, was steadfast and reticent, studied diligently despite poverty, and particularly favored the *Zuoshi Spring and Autumn Annals* and *Sun and Wu’s Art of War*. When the northern frontier fell into chaos, his mother urged him to join the army and repay the nation. He could not bear to leave, but she repeatedly pressed him, so he reluctantly left his wife to care for her and followed Emperor Gaozong across the river alone.

When Hebei fell, all communication was severed. He sought news of his mother day and night for years without success. Then, someone arrived from his mother’s village and relayed her message: "Tell Fifth Son to serve the Sacred Son of Heaven diligently and not worry about this old woman." He secretly sent someone to fetch her, but bandits obstructed the way. After eighteen attempts, she finally returned.

Later, she suffered from a hernia. Though he was occupied with royal duties, he would steal moments at dawn and dusk to visit, personally tasting her medicine, feeding her, and discussing its effects. His footsteps were silent as he moved about. Before each military campaign, he strictly instructed his family to attend to her carefully.

When she died, he refused all food and drink for three days, nearly wasting away. He and his son Yun carried her coffin to the grave. After the burial, he built a hut by the grave, carved a wooden likeness of her, and performed the rituals of warmth, cleansing, morning, and evening greetings as if she were alive.

He had five sons: Yun, Lei, Lin, Zhen, and Ting. Yun enlisted at twelve and performed many extraordinary feats in battle; the army called him "The Frail Official." He died at twenty-three. His daughter, not yet married, grieved over her father and brother’s wrongful deaths and drowned herself in a well with a silver vase.

When Emperor Xiaozong ascended the throne, Yue Fei’s original rank was posthumously restored, and his family—father, sons, and daughter—were honored accordingly.

The Record states: How could Yue Fei’s entire family be deemed insignificant? Zixia said: "In serving parents, one should exhaust one’s strength; in serving the ruler, one should dedicate one’s life." Yue Fei did not merely study or discuss these words—he embodied and practiced them. Though one might call him unlearned, I would still call him a scholar. Is this not truly the case?

Yet Yue Fei could have sons like Yun, who, though adopted and lacking the guidance of a strict teacher or worthy father, and a daughter who was young and unlearned, knew the beauty of sacrificing oneself to fulfill righteousness. It is said: "When one’s own conduct is upright, one’s orders are followed without command." In the father, brothers, and children of the Yue family, I have witnessed this.

In the late Xianchun era, Xu Yingbiao was admitted as a National University student after passing the examination. In the second year of Deyou, when the Song fell, Emperor Ying of Ying followed the Yuan to Yan, and the three students all accompanied him.

Xu Yingbiao refused to follow and instead swore with his son Qi Song and daughter Yuan Niang to die together in fire, and both children gladly complied. There stood an old shrine to Yue Fei’s younger brother within the National University, where Yingbiao prepared wine and meat to offer in sacrifice. He prayed to Fei, saying: “Heaven has not protected the Song, and the altars of the state lie in ruins. Yingbiao will die to repay the nation, vowing never to journey north with the other students. Though death may burden Your Majesty with my soul, I shall serve as an attendant to Your spirit, forever and without end.”

Qi likewise composed a poem to pledge his resolve. After the rites, Yingbiao shared the sacrificial wine and meat with his servants, allowing them to drink until drunk. Then, with his son and daughter, he entered the Tiyun Tower, piling books, chests, and baskets from the rooms all around. They set the fire and perished together.

One servant, still awake, heard the flames and rushed to the tower. Peering through a window, he saw the father and children seated and standing in solemn stillness, like statues in a temple. He ran to alert the other servants, who broke through the wall and extinguished the fire. Yingbiao, however, could not die, and with his children, he departed in dejection, their whereabouts unknown by night’s end.

The next day, their bodies were found in a well before the shrine—all stiff and upright, eyes wide, faces as though still living. The servants prepared coffins and laid them to rest. When King Yi ascended, he honored Yingbiao’s integrity, posthumously appointing him Gentleman for Court Service and Compiler of the Secret Pavilion.

Later, his fellow student Liu Wenjun gathered their remains and buried them at Fangjiayu, privately conferring the posthumous title *Master of Unyielding Integrity*.

**Record states:** Since the virtue of the Song had unraveled, the spirit of its scholars had been tarnished and withered. Those who passed through this era were wounded by its urgency—men like Chen Shu and Ouyang Che, who clamored without rest...

Those who fell short sank into ignominy and baseness—like the three Taixue students, their spirits dimmed and conscience troubled. How could one have expected the father and son, the venerable Ying, to emerge from their midst?

To lay down one’s life for humanity is the noble virtue of the gentleman. Yet even with Yingbiao’s cultivated bearing, and with Qi and Song’s long-standing renown, they still claimed that the crisis did not concern them, that their high station excused them. What, then, of his daughter Yuan-niang? In nature, she was frail, lacking any bold and generous resolve; in years, she was young, without the steadfast integrity of frost-enduring pines. Yet when the nation fell and the sovereign perished, she willingly chose to die alongside them—proof that the goodness of inborn endowment cannot be dismissed on account of youth or weakness. How could the traitors of that time, those who sold the country and surrendered to the barbarians, face themselves without spitting in shame?

Moreover, Yingbiao’s death was reported to Yue Fei, whose spirit had long resonated with his. Would not such a household of loyalty and filial piety stir his heart and rouse his resolve? The example of Yue’s daughter would not have been in vain.

Alas! This may truly be called *ren*.

From the *History of Yuan*: Shi Tianze had eight sons—Ge, Zhang, Di, Gang, Qi, Zi, Kai, and Bin—all of whom held prominent offices. At forty, Tianze began to humble himself and devote himself to study. In private, he never boasted, yet when facing matters of great consequence or deliberating weighty affairs, he resolutely took the burdens of the realm upon himself, his judgments surpassing others’ expectations. On the day he was appointed chancellor, his household remained quiet and unassuming. Someone urged him to wield power to assert himself, but he replied: “Rank, emolument, punishment, and reward are the prerogatives of the Son of Heaven. What need have I for power?” Thereupon he declined, and the speaker, ashamed, withdrew. When renowned scholars and displaced literati of the fallen Jin dynasty found themselves without refuge, he provided for their livelihoods and treated them with the courtesy due guests, and many later rose to prominence. After capturing Guide, he spared Li Dalang and sent him to Zhen ding, appointing him as an advisor. For over fifty years, he served as both general and minister, trusted by the throne and unopposed by his subordinates. People compared him to Guo Ziyi and Cao Wuhui.

**Recorded Remarks:** Observing the Yuan dynasty’s rise from near-collapse to reclaim China, one sees how Tianze and his brothers and sons, though they held the highest military and civil ranks, regarded wealth, honor, and power with restraint, as if they were but fleeting shadows. And when he neared his end, he foretold the devastation of slaughter and plunder, yet ultimately secured the submission of Jiangnan—so that Bayan cannot alone claim the glory. This is worth recording.

From the *Book of the Five Relations*: When Yuan Yingzong was still Crown Prince, Emperor Renzong fell ill, and Yingzong’s distress was evident in his countenance. At night, he burned incense and wept, saying: “The Supreme One rules the realm with benevolence, and all affairs prosper in harmony; the Four Seas are at peace. Now Heaven sends this great affliction—let the punishment fall upon me instead, that the Supreme One may forever remain the sovereign of the people.” When Renzong passed, Yingzong mourned beyond the rites of a single day, wearing plain garments and prostrating himself upon the ground. He ate but a single bowl of porridge. Upon ascending the throne, he issued an edict to the Court of Imperial Sacrifices: “I shall personally offer sacrifices at the Grand Temple in each of the four seasons. Let the rites be deliberated and conducted in full accordance with the classics, without any reduction on account of my toil in reverence before the ancestral spirits.” **Recorded Remarks:** The histories praise Emperor Renzong as a ruler of innate benevolence and filial piety, intelligence, reverence, frugality, and mastery of Confucian learning. He cherished and nurtured the people’s strength, governing with tireless diligence, and was the guardian of the Yuan’s golden age of virtuous rule. Succeeded by Yingzong, whose filial devotion was profound and sincere, these two sovereigns alone stand out in the final years of the Yuan.

From the *Record of Illustrious Ministers of the August Ming*: Zhang Yi was of the utmost filial nature. In his youth, he followed local scholars and, hearing that Jinhua was a land of literary heritage, traveled there to seek instruction in its traditions. Arriving in Wulin, he suddenly felt a pang of dread and hurried home, only to find his father’s illness had reached its crisis. Eight days later, his father passed. People attributed this to the power of his filial devotion. Before the funeral rites could be held, bandits rose in the village, and his home was burned to the ground.

Zhang Yi struck his forehead and cried out to Heaven; the fire reached the coffin’s resting place and then extinguished. Later, in mourning his mother, his grief was so overwhelming that when he personally carried earth and stone to prepare her grave, his illness worsened. His relative He Jun came to visit and said, “You must restrain this heart of yours and not cling so stubbornly.” Zhang Yi replied, “I understand.”

Having long lived apart from his two elder brothers, he built a new residence at Longge and invited them to live together, their harmonious affection as warm as ever. At that time, with the realm in chaos, he withdrew to take refuge in Min. The Taizu Emperor dispatched envoys to summon Zhang Yi, Liu Ji, Ye Shen, and Song Lian to Jianye for an audience. Upon meeting them, he declared, “I have humbled myself before the four masters for the sake of the realm.”

The *Record* states: Wei Wuzhi, with the conduct of Weisheng and Xiaoji, could not alter the course of victory or defeat—was this not so? Zhang Yi, with his capacity for both prominence and obscurity, embodied the learning of cultivating the heart and nurturing the self. Observe how his filial devotion stirred such alarm, how his grief for his mother seemed as though it would last a lifetime. Yet when he later assisted the illustrious founder, his achievements became manifest—securing Min’s submission, devising strategies for land reclamation and troop deployment—all proving effective. Truly, he was one in whom inner essence and outward function were complete, whether in prominence or obscurity. How could this be the work of one dull and inept? From this, one may glimpse the principles by which the Ming and Han employed men.

Chen Xianzhang lost his father early, and his mother, née Cai, served him with the utmost care, making it difficult for him to leave her side. Though he once sat for the Ministry of Rites examination, he did not proceed further. Later, despite repeated summons, he declined them all. When pressed to come to the capital, he submitted a memorial, which read in part: “My mother, widowed in poverty and lowly circumstances, has lived without comfort, her deep sorrows turning to illness, which has grown worse with age. If I were to travel far to a foreign land, her anxiety for me would only intensify. The more she worries, the sicker she becomes; the sicker she becomes, the more she worries—this cycle of distress cannot endure long. With my ailing body and my mother’s advanced age, though my years are not yet spent, my qi has already weakened. My heart desires to serve, but my strength is insufficient. If one’s inner heart is not afflicted, then external duties present no difficulty. With a sovereign of utmost benevolence above, there will be many officials below who accommodate and fulfill.”

The memorial was submitted, and Emperor Xianzong personally read it again and again. The next day, he specially appointed the author as Hanlin Academy Examining Editor and permitted him to return home to care for his parent.

A record states: This memorial shines even brighter than *Chen Qing Biao*. Truly, "with a sovereign of utmost benevolence above, there will be many officials below who accommodate and fulfill." The sagely court’s governance through filial piety is not to be compared with Lingbo’s time, when transformation was possible. Yet in the end, his deep devotion to nurturing his family at home won the admiration of all under heaven—how does this compare to serving as Prefect of Wen or laboring in office while ill? The imperial decree was forcefully issued, exempting him from departmental examinations, unlike those who rely on connections or circumstances. "When the court lacks men of integrity, it is better to return to the fields." Thus, it is recorded.

When Chen Maolie served as censor, he impeached Minister of Works Chang and Vice Minister Cui. Later, due to his mother’s advanced age, he submitted a request to resign and care for her. The Ministry of Personnel, considering his family’s poverty, followed the precedent of Vice Minister Pan Li and memorialized to grant him three *shi* of rice monthly to support his filial devotion. Chen firmly declined in a memorial, which read in part: "Your Majesty has descended the transformative influence of filial governance and fostered the wind of integrity. Even a lowly official like myself has received your compassion—how could this be the fortune of my family alone? Yet I recall that my family has long been poor, our meals simple and frugal. Thus, my mother and I have grown accustomed to my meager support, and I, too, have learned to endure our poverty. This is not because I possess extraordinary integrity or surpassing filial devotion. The ancients carried firewood and shouldered rice, but I have not even reached such a state. My mother raised me in poverty and widowhood, enduring hardships a hundredfold. Though I exhaust my strength in caring for her, I have not repaid even a drop of her boundless kindness. Now she is eighty-six, and the days ahead may not be many. My private desire to fulfill the duty of returning nurture compels me to devote all my resources to her care. Yet I secretly feel uneasy about accepting the monthly stipend. The court governs the realm through filial piety." The imperial edict declared: "Chen Maolie’s frugality and integrity are admirable; his request to decline is not permitted."

After his mother’s death, Chen wailed and collapsed to the ground, never recovering. To this day, his village is marked with a stele inscribed: "Filial and Incorrupt." A record states: *The History of the Song* praises Master Xu of Jiexiao as steadfast in virtue. Was Chen Maolie’s conduct not the same? He practiced frugality and self-cultivation at home, composed his thoughts in stillness among friends, and was known for his uprightness at court. Yet his profound devotion to nurturing his mother and his pure, hidden virtue—why was he left without descendants? I once passed by his gate and thus recorded his story in this way.

Geng Qinghui, Duke of Integrity, whose courtesy name was Jiuzhou, and his son, Geng Wenke, Duke of Erudition, whose courtesy name was Yu, served four reigns—Xuan, Ying, Xian, and Xiao. Qinghui rose to Minister of Justice in Nanjing, his incorruptible virtue and weighty reputation renowned throughout the realm. Though he held high office, he never abandoned his Confucian principles. Wenke later served as Minister of Personnel, known as "Qingya," and was appointed as a historiographer, Libationer, and Minister of Rites. The family maintained its purity and integrity, standing at the forefront of the Confucian tradition. Censor Wang Xuan memorialized that his heart was open and unobstructed, utterly free of self-interest, comparing him to Wang Zhongsu and Wang Duanyi.

Zhou Zhuangyi, Duke of Virtue, whose courtesy name was Yi, and his son, Zhou Wenrui, Duke of Culture, whose courtesy name was Jing, were both renowned ministers.

Duke of Virtue Zhuangyi rose to Minister of Justice in Nanjing. His nature was magnanimous, his bearing refined and graceful. Throughout his life, he served his superiors with particular reverence and prudence. For nearly forty years, he moved between the judicial offices of the two capitals, never inflicting harm upon others or damaging any living thing. His achievements in overseeing relief distributions, managing granaries, and sustaining the people’s welfare were especially great. He ascended to the Eight Seats of honor and lived nearly to eighty.

His descendants held offices of purity and importance. Duke of Culture Wenduan passed the imperial examinations and spent nearly thirty years in the Hanlin Academy and the Spring Pavilion. When the Filial Emperor was still Crown Prince, the Duke served as his tutor, offering many enlightening insights. He frequently lectured on the *Great Instructions of Wenhua*. Each time, the Filial Emperor would rise and listen with hands clasped in respect—such was his observance of ritual propriety.

Later, as Vice Minister of Rites, whenever he discussed governance, he invariably cited the classics. If the court undertook matters of great virtue, he would vigorously support them. Transferred to the Ministry of Personnel, he urged early court assemblies and diligent governance. Appointed Minister of Revenue, he took personal responsibility for affairs, undeterred by considerations of profit or harm. He carefully selected subordinates, personally overseeing granary management, cutting through complexity, and responding to crises without delay. In administering governance and upholding the law, he remained unyielding to the influence of imperial in-laws or powerful factions, embodying the spirit of the ancient great ministers.

Minister Xu Xiangyi advanced through the ranks. His eight sons received imperial edicts, encomiums, records, poems, lyrics, discourses, and epitaphs. By nature, he was filial and prudent. Once, when chastised by his father’s instruction, he was struck until his fingers bled; thereafter, whenever he showed the scars to others, he would be overcome with emotion. When the northern tribes invaded the western frontier, he was appointed Grand Coordinator and Governor of Gansu.

The Turpan held an age-old grudge against Hami, dispatching their tribal chieftains to drive out its king and occupy its city. Minister Xu, together with Commander-in-Chief Liu Ning, mobilized the Chijin, Han, and Shushu tribes as reinforcements. On a snowy night, they breached the city and crushed the rebellion. Among the eight hundred who had joined the revolt, some proposed slaughtering them all, but Minister Xu refused. Commentators remarked: "Xu the Resolute granted life to eight hundred doomed souls—truly a man of benevolence. That his descendants prosper is only fitting." Later, his son Xu Gao again served as Minister of Revenue, assisting the Ministers of Personnel, Revenue, and Justice. As Grand Secretary of the Hall of Martial Valor, he was appointed Censor-in-Chief and Governor of Shuntian, a legacy that endures to this day.

Minister Lin Wen’an, posthumously honored as Duke Wen’an, had nine sons: Lin Tinggui, Tingyang, Tingkai, Tingshuo, Tingzhang, Tingtou, Tingban, Tingzhi, and Tingji. As Director of the Directorate of Education, he governed with strictness yet kindness, petitioning to expand the imperial examinations and tribute system to cultivate talent without stifling potential. During the Zhengde era, he memorialized the throne on four matters: securing Nanjing to uphold the ancestral foundation, nurturing the heir apparent to safeguard the realm’s root, pacifying the people to strengthen the state’s foundation, and fostering worthy talent to ensure effective governance. Later promoted to Minister of War in Nanjing and Advisor to Military Affairs, he again submitted twelve proposals in response to natural disasters, broadly urging: "Your Majesty, entrusted with the weighty legacy of your predecessor, must rely on great ministers as the late emperor did, uphold established policies without altering his designs, dismiss sycophants near and far to emulate his devotion to worthy counsel, reject favoritism toward imperial relatives to fulfill his commitment to impartiality, fortify border defenses as he never forgot the threat of barbarians, and practice frugality as he never forgot the people’s welfare." Scholars praised his governance, with Yao Jing comparing him to Han Qi and Fan Zhongyan in the flourishing era of the Xiaozong Emperor. His family was harmonious, his descendants upright and prudent, evoking the legacy of the Wanshi Clan. In his hometown, his influence swayed the entire province, akin to Yang Cheng and Jin Bi’s transformative impact. With hoary brows and silver hair, he was revered by his community, much like Fu Bi of the Luoshe, the esteemed Duke Wenyi. Later, his son Lin Tingzhi served as Minister of Works and Grand Guardian of the Heir Apparent, Tingshuo as Prefect, and Tingji as Hanlin Academy Examining Editor. Their descendants, including Tingji’s son Lin Xuan and Lin Lian, continued the family’s distinguished legacy.

This record observes: The Lü and Yuan clans of Taiyuan and Lingbao produced eminent ministers for their age, yet the virtue of Quanshan and Yuande is not to be overlooked. Witnessing the bond between these fathers and sons, one sees no small measure of such excellence. Thus, the noble man is ever encouraged to pursue goodness. So it is recorded.

*The Great Compendium of Ming Ethics*: In the sixteenth year of the Zhengde reign, on the *renwu* day of the fourth month, the Emperor bade farewell at the newly completed tomb of Xingxian Wang. Overcome with grief, he prostrated himself weeping upon the ground; attendants raised him to his feet, yet he lingered, circling and gazing back, unwilling to depart. Twice he bowed, weeping bitterly. None among his retinue remained unmoved.

On the *guiwei* day, the imperial procession departed from Anlu. The Emperor could not bear to leave his Sacred Mother so soon and wept with stifled sobs. The Sacred Mother said: "My son, this journey bears a weighty duty—guard your words well." The Emperor replied: "I humbly receive your instruction."

This record observes: The beginning takes the filial piety of the Great Shun to illuminate the transmission of the abdicated succession, marking the wellspring of all virtues. The end takes the Emperor’s grief and longing to fulfill the trust of a true king and serve as a model for the realm below. As the *Book of Songs* says: *"Ever mindful of filial devotion."* When filial devotion is the guiding thought, how could the sages of old and those of later times not share the same thread and common principle?

*Hongdao Lu*, Scroll Six, concludes.
*Hongdao Lu*, Scroll Seven.

The Benevolence of Husband and Wife

Mencius said: "When Shun was Son of Heaven, he wore simple robes, played the zither, and enjoyed the company of his two wives as if they had always been his." This record observes: I see that the Great Shun, in his harmonious governance, carried such a demeanor. Yet some meddlesome contemporaries fabricated tales of "two sisters-in-law managing his dwelling," how perverse! Thus, rather than refuting such falsehoods, it would be better if they had never been written at all.

It further says: The *Book of Songs* states:
*"When zither and lute are played in harmony,
None fail to find peace and goodness."*
This is not only true for the Son of Heaven—even the humblest husband and wife, within their inner chambers, are no different.

In the Han dynasty, there were also "chamber lyrics and music," composed by Emperor Gaozu’s consort, Lady Tangshan. Later, Emperor Wu appointed Li Yannian as Master of Harmonizing Pitch, yet the likes of Lady Li were worlds apart from the ancients—how could they not fall short of antiquity?

It further says: Long ago, King Tai loved beauty and cherished his consort. The *Book of Songs* says:
*"Lord Gu Gong,
Came at dawn, riding swiftly,
Following the western waters’ flow,
To the foot of Mount Qi.
There with his lady Jiang,
They came to choose their home."*
At that time, within the kingdom, there were no resentful maidens, nor were there bachelors left unwed. If the king delighted in beauty, sharing such joy with his people, what harm could it bring to his rule?

This record observes: Should not Heaven’s delight in beauty be like this? From birth, men wish to have a wife, and women wish to have a husband—sages have never forbidden such desires. With no resentful maidens within and no unwed men without, beauty has never been a calamity to humankind. This is what is called *xing* (natural disposition), not *ji* (disease). Yet people, ignorant of this truth, often indulge in alluring beauty and seductive charm, leading to arrogance, dissipation, and excess. They see only its harm, not its virtue, turning Heaven’s natural disposition into a thicket of human desire—so much so that it topples states and ruins cities, bringing dire disaster. This was never the intent of the ancient kings’ delight in beauty.

*The Book of Songs.*

**The Great Brightness:**

To speak of King Wen’s sageliness, one must trace its origin: Zhong Ren of Zhi, from the distant Yin Shang, came to marry into Zhou, becoming a consort in its capital.

This record observes: The *Commentary* states, "When a state is about to rise, there are always auspicious omens; when a state is about to fall, there are always portents." Disasters appear in the heavens, and transformations arise on earth. Though omens may manifest, they are not yet true calamities. Only the portents of women are irredeemable. At that time, Yin’s rightful heir still held the throne, with no sign of peril or ruin—yet a single Daji was born. The interrogations could not but grow severe, the punishments could not but turn excessive. Yet Heaven established its counterpart: the Zhou consorts Tai Ren, Tai Si, and Yi Jiang, all gathered at one gate. Never had Heaven’s favor been so abundant. How then could Tai Wang, King Ji, King Wen, and King Wu dare act with presumption? They could only say: "The radiance is manifest below."

King Wen of Zhou was born with sagely virtue and was matched with the sagely lady of the Si clan. When she first arrived in the palace, those within saw her quiet, retiring, chaste, and serene virtue. They composed a poem:

*Guan guan cry the ospreys,*
*On the isle in the river.*
*Graceful and fair is the maiden,*
*A fit mate for the lord.*

*Long and short the water plants,*
*Left and right we gather them.*
*Graceful and fair is the maiden,*
*Waking and sleeping we seek her.*

*Seeking her yet not attaining,*
*Waking and sleeping we long for her.*
*Endlessly, endlessly,*
*Tossing and turning we lie.*

*Long and short the water plants,*
*Left and right we cull them.*
*Graceful and fair is the maiden,*
*With zither and lute we befriend her.*

*Long and short the water plants,*
*Left and right we bind them.*
*Graceful and fair is the maiden,*
*With bells and drums we delight her.*

Kuang Heng said: "The union of husband and wife is the beginning of the people, the source of all blessings. When the rites of marriage are correct, all things flourish and Heaven’s mandate is fulfilled." Confucius placed *Guan Ju* at the beginning of the *Book of Songs*, saying, "The highest are the parents of the people." If the conduct of the queen and consorts does not align with Heaven and Earth, they cannot serve the lineage of the spirits or govern the proper order of all things. Since high antiquity, the rise and fall of the Three Dynasties have never deviated from this principle.

This record observes: Confucius said, "*Guan Ju* is joyful yet not wanton, mournful yet not harmed." He also said, "From Shi Zhi’s beginning to *Guan Ju*’s conclusion, how abundant and full it sounds!" And again: "One who does not study the *Zhou Nan* and *Shao Nan* is like standing facing a wall." Why then does our Son of Heaven show such disdain for the *Guan Ju* poem? Truly, the Way of the sage and worthy is rooted in the near, and the governance of emperors and kings begins with the self. In perfect goodness and complete beauty, with inner and outer harmony fully realized, none have matched King Wen and Tai Si.

Thus, though Yao’s two daughters were sagely, had he married without proper announcement, even their tossing and turning in longing would have gone unseen. Though Yu of Tu Shan was virtuous, from *xin* to *jia*, he passed his own gate three times without entering—even had there been the joy of zither, lute, bells, and drums, how could it have been expressed, leading to the completion of his great work? When Emperor Cheng took Zhao Feiyan into the palace, those within, upon her arrival, called her "calamity’s waters," saying, "Fire will be extinguished again." Though there may have been deep sorrow and pressing concern, where could such feelings find expression? Kuang Heng’s words have their origins. Yet even our Master Confucius, the greatest of sages, harbored regret over his wife’s conduct. How deeply he must have been moved by Bo Yu! How deeply moved by Bo Yu!

The queen and consorts, free from jealousy and envy, brought joy to the many concubines, who praised their virtue, singing:

*In the south there is a bending tree,*
*Creepers coil all around it.*
*Joyful is our lord,*
*Fortune and blessing attend him.*

*In the south there is a bending tree,*
*Creepers spread all over it.*
*Joyful is our lord,*
*Fortune and blessing uphold him.*

*In the south there is a bending tree,*
*Creepers twine all about it.*
*Joyful is our lord,*
*Fortune and blessing complete him.*

This record observes: Observing the song of the creeping vines, I grasp the author’s effortless artistry. The tendrils of the vine are the queen’s nine duties. That the queen’s affairs become the praise of the concubines—does this require reflection to attain? Melons, wood, and firewood—things even the Duke of Zhou did not discard—how could the palace women forget the bending tree and creeping vines? From this, one sees that the learning of the ancients did not depend on forced seeking. Even women and girls walked the same path as the greatest sages and worthies. Was this not self-attainment?

King Wen’s transformation began in the home and extended to the state: men and women were rectified, marriages occurred in their proper season. Thus, the poets, inspired by what they saw, sang:

*Peach tree young and fair,*
*Bright its blossoms glow.*
*This maiden weds today,*
*Fitting for her household.*

*Peach tree young and fair,*
*Abundant its fruit.*
*This maiden weds today,*
*Fitting for her home.*

*Peach tree young and fair,*
*Lush its leaves unfold.*
*This maiden weds today,*
*Fitting for her kin.*

This record observes: Mencius, speaking of Tai Wang, said, "Within, no resentful maidens; without, no unwed men." The poets, singing of the king, said, "This maiden weds today, fitting for her kin." Is this not because the kingly Way begins with husband and wife? Nothing is as timely and flourishing as the peach in bloom, nothing as fresh and fine as young men and women. Here one sees the diligence of timely action, the care of nurturing love, the kindness of the myriad people, the fullness of harmonious qi. To exhaust the goodness of poetry, one may observe it here.

The transformation spread, customs improved, households were at peace, and women, with nothing to occupy them, gathered *fu yi* together, composing verses to delight in their task:

*Gather, gather the plantain,*
*Quickly now, pluck it.*
*Gather, gather the plantain,*
*Quickly now, take it.*

Gather, gather the plantain,
Quickly now, gather it in.
Gather, gather the plantain,
Quickly now, take it away.

Gather, gather the plantain,
Quickly now, bind it up.
Gather, gather the plantain,
Quickly now, tuck it in.

Recorded note: Where could women find no occupation?
"By the banks of the Ru," they toil for the king’s affairs;
"Spinning fish-tail knots," they serve a disordered state;
"Dew soaks the path," they guard against assault;
"Sparrows’ beaks and rats’ teeth," they fear brute force.
In times of firm governance, such moments must not be lost—lest they breed resentment. Even a dog’s bark at the door cannot be dismissed as mere noise.

Yet when transformation spreads and customs improve, when households are cautious and at peace, is it not in such gathering of plantain that we see it?

From the *Greater Odes*: The wife of the Marquis of Han was the daughter of Juefu. The *Poetry* says:
"Juefu, mighty in valor,
No land he left unvisited,
To arrange the marriage of Han’s lady—
Nothing compares to Han’s joy.
How joyous is Han’s land!
Its rivers and marshes teem,
Its fields are rich and broad,
Its deer and stags abound,
With bears and brown bears,
With wildcats and tigers.
Blessed with such a fine abode,
Han’s lady feasts in praise."

Recorded note: The affairs of the Marquis of Han cannot be verified. Yet observing "The gentleman in old age," with her headdress and six pendants, one may well feast. But the words of Zhongsuan cannot be taken as praise. "The great officer retires without troubling his lord"—this may be called a blessing. Yet his early rise and violent end do not make him worthy. Thus, "Blessed with such a fine abode, Han’s lady feasts in praise"—the gentleman ascribes virtue to this.

From the *Zuo Tradition*: When the House of Yi divined a wife for Jing Zhong, his wife interpreted the oracle, saying: "Auspicious. This is called 'phoenixes in flight, harmonious cries ringing clear.' After the rise of the Ji clan, they will be nurtured by the Jiang. In five generations, they will prosper; by the rank of chief minister, in eight generations, none will surpass them."

Recorded note: The hexagrams *Xian* and *Heng* say: *Xian* means "to feel," *Heng* means "to endure." The Way of husband and wife exists only when feeling endures. Is this not the "harmonious cries ringing clear" and "prosperity in five generations"? Yet if one indulges in revelry and dance, without spring or summer, even to the point of Zhu Lin and Xia Nan—this is what is meant by "not enduring in virtue, and perhaps inheriting shame." This is why Chen perished and why Gu Zhong met his fate. One need not rely on the divination of the House of Yi to know this.

When Zhao Chengzi resided in Jin, he married the daughter of Duke Wen, named Zhao Ji, who bore Yuan Tong, Ping Kuo, and Lou Ying. Later, while following Duke Wen in Di, the Di people attacked Fu Jiu, capturing his two daughters, Shu Yuan and Ji Yuan, and presenting them to Duke Wen. The duke took Ji Yuan for himself and gave Shu Yuan to Chengzi, who bore Dun. When Duke Wen returned to his state, Zhao Ji requested that Dun and his mother be brought to her. Chengzi declined, but Ji said: "To gain favor and forget the old—how can one command others? You must allow it." She insisted, and he consented. Seeing Dun’s talent, she firmly requested of the duke that he be made the primary heir, demoting her own three sons to serve under him. She also elevated Shu Yuan as his principal wife, demoting herself to a secondary position.

Recorded note: Zhao Ji surpassed others in virtue by several degrees. She possessed the capacity to accommodate others, the virtue of humility, and the wisdom to recognize talent. A mother-in-law who cannot tolerate, a wife who is arrogant, or a woman who loves blindly—these are the common failings of women. How much more so when she was the noble daughter of a duke, while her rival was a lowly Di wife, and when her own sons were many, while the other’s child was of humble birth? Yet she said: "To gain favor and forget the old—how can one command others?" Truly, she understood the bond of shared hardship, not merely the desire for fresh well-water. And when she saw Dun’s talent and firmly requested he be made the primary heir, she truly cut away her own fleshly love, not merely distinguishing between the Jing and Wei rivers. In the end, he succeeded Chengzi in governance, bringing glory to the ducal clan. Who would say a woman could not favor her kin? Alas! She may be called benevolent.

From the *Biographies of Exemplary Women*: The Two Compliant Women of Wei were the wife and concubine of Duke Ling of Wei. When the duke died, his wife had no son. She said to the concubine: "The young one served me with great care. You attend to the ancestral rites, while I, as a concubine, serve you—I find this unbearable. Moreover, I have heard that the mother of a ruler does not serve others as a concubine. Now, with no son, I am one who should be cast aside by ritual. Yet I am allowed to remain and fulfill my duty—this is my good fortune. Now, to further trouble the young one would be too much. I wish to move outside, to live in the outer chambers, which would be most fitting." The concubine wept and said: "Does my lady wish for the House of Ling to incur three misfortunes? To not serve the lord to the end—this is the first misfortune. For the lady to have no son while the concubine has one—this is the second misfortune. For the lady to move outside while the concubine’s son remains within—this is the third misfortune. Your servant has heard that a loyal minister serves his lord without rest, and a filial son attends to his parents without wearying of the days. How could I, for the sake of a slight elevation in status, alter my duty?" She then told her son: "I have heard that a gentleman abides in compliance, upholding the rites of high and low, following the ancient ways—this is the Way of compliance. Now, the lady finds me difficult and wishes to move outside, placing me within—this is the Way of disorder. To live in defiance is not as good as to die in compliance." She wished to take her own life, but the spirits and people, hearing of it, were alarmed. They allowed her to remain and serve to the end.

The gentleman said: "These two women may be called those whose conduct was perfected within the inner chambers, and whose names were established for later generations."

Recorded note: The lady had no son, while the concubine did—this posed no harm to her status as primary wife. What need was there for distinction, or for inner and outer chambers? If this were so, then a son could not be without a mother, but the primary wife might be diminished. In Qin, the custom was to honor Lady Huayang and discard Queen Yang, treating her like worn-out straw sandals—was this simply the way of the times? Or was it that when Emperor Xiao of Han deposed Empress Xu and enthroned Zhao Feiyan, when Ban Jieyu sought to move outside and together served in the Changxin Palace, they were making veiled criticisms?

Should such indulgence be left unchecked, it would become the root of later usurpations of the legitimate heir in favor of a favored one—though this may not have been transmitted, it is worth recording. Here, the note preserves the doubtful implications.

From *The Western Han History*: In his youth, Chen Ping was poor and fond of study, and as he grew, he was handsome. When he reached marriageable age, no wealthy family would give him their daughter, and the poor families also shunned him for long. A wealthy man of Huyou named Zhang Fu had a granddaughter and said to his son Zhong: "I wish to marry her to Chen Ping." Zhong replied: "Ping is poor and does not attend to his affairs; the whole county laughs at his conduct. Why would you give her to him?" Fu said: "Is there truly one as fine as Chen Ping who should remain poor?" In the end, he gave his granddaughter to him. As Ping was poor, Fu lent him silk and cloth for the betrothal gifts, provided funds for wine and meat, and sent her in as his wife. He further admonished his granddaughter: "Do not, on account of poverty, fail to serve others with respect. Serve your elder brother as you would your father, and your sister-in-law as you would your mother." After Chen Ping married Zhang’s daughter, his resources grew more abundant, and his connections expanded daily.

The note states: Amid the remnants of a decadent and shallow age, there was still the discernment of the wealthy man Zhang Fu—this may be taken as evidence of the sprouts of dynastic change. If even a single hairpin’s worth was begrudged, how much more so a daughter as fine as jade? If even a single basket’s worth was boasted of, how much more so wealth like flowing springs? When the great Han rose to glory, there was Lü Gong’s daughter, a beauty from childhood, and later, Zhang Fu’s granddaughter, whose reputation spread. Yet she did not grow arrogant with wealth and prominence; in the end, her wifely conduct became ever more refined, and her husband’s virtue ever more advanced—this was what is called "inner achievement bringing good fortune." Could this not be deemed benevolence?

When Emperor Xuan was first the imperial great-grandson, he was caught up in the witchcraft affair and raised in the palace rear chambers. As *The History of the Han by Xu Guang* records: The Son of Heaven, reduced to the same rank, lived together with him in the same temple. At the time, the eunuch Zhang He, formerly of Crown Prince Wei, treated the young imperial scion with great kindness. Guang had a daughter, Pingjun, aged fourteen or fifteen, who was divined to be destined for great nobility. He requested that she be married to the imperial great-grandson, and within a year, she bore the future Emperor Yuan. After he ascended the throne, he made Xu Pingjun his *jieyu*. When the time came to establish an empress, General Huo had a young daughter, closely related to the Empress Dowager, and all the court officials privately favored the general’s daughter, though none dared speak of it. The emperor then issued an edict seeking the sword from his humble days. The ministers understood the implication and established Xu Jieyu as empress.

The note states: Was the disaster of the Huo clan not already sprouting here? The trigger was subtle, but its consequences were vast. If all in the court privately favored her, did the Huo clan not secretly presume as much? If Huo Guang did not know, did the emperor perhaps already know? The emperor’s intent was already fixed. When Shaofu was advanced, the emperor had long pondered the matter; his silence on the intent was not truly silence. The earlier intent could be revealed, but the present intent was difficult to make clear. If Guang did not endorse it, could the emperor be blamed for Guang’s fault? The historians did not examine this closely, attributing the cause to the verification of reckless indulgence—how superficial!

From *The Eastern Han History*: In the third year of Yongping, the officials memorialized to establish the Changqiu Palace. The Empress Dowager said: "Lady Ma’s virtue surpasses that of the rear palace." She was thus established as empress. The empress could recite the *Book of Changes*, enjoyed reading the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and the *Chu Ci*, and was especially skilled in the *Rites of Zhou* and the writings of Dong Zhongshu. After assuming her position, she became ever more modest and solemn, often wearing coarse silk, her skirts unadorned with green. When the emperor visited the gardens and detached palaces, she would caution him against wind, miasma, and baleful vapors, her words earnest and well-considered, and many of her suggestions were adopted. Thus, his excursions and amusements were rarely accompanied by her. At the time, the Chu trials dragged on for years, with mutual accusations leading to many arrests. The empress, concerned about the excesses, took the opportunity to speak of it, her tone deeply compassionate. The emperor was moved, rising at night in restless thought, and in the end, many were pardoned. When Emperor Suzong ascended the throne, he honored her as Empress Dowager. She often discussed governance and Dao with him morning and night, instructed the various princes in the classics, and recounted the virtues of her late husband, speaking all day with reverence: "In my youth, I admired only the bamboo and silk [of the classics], and my aspirations did not consider life’s brevity. Now, though I am old, I am again warned against excess. Thus, I remain vigilant at night, striving to restrain myself, not seeking comfort in my dwelling nor fullness in my meals, hoping by this Dao to not fail the late emperor."

The note states: Was it not fitting that the empress’s virtue shone as bright virtue? The female is the embodiment of yin, her nature soft. Thus, she is often inclined toward extravagance, acquisitiveness, pleasure, and generosity, wearying of rich foods and fine grains, seeking ease and indulgence—this is her norm. Yet how much more so when she is honored as the mother of the empire, possessing all under heaven, and yet she devoted herself ever more to diligence and frugality: wearing coarse silk, personally tending silkworms and weaving, declining excursions and amusements, remonstrating against the Chu trials, rejecting external favors, and refusing prayers and sacrifices. These were not empty displays or superficial adornments, but true virtue and sincere intent flowing through twenty-three years—how could one be deluded? Tracing the source, the empress did not regard herself as merely yin’s embodiment or constrained by her soft nature; what she admired lay in the bamboo and silk [of the classics], and her aspirations lay in the sages. These words laid the foundation—could this be called virtue pervading the rear palace? Truly so. Between the two Han dynasties, none could compare.

When Song Hong served as Grand Minister of Works, Lady Huyang, the Princess, had recently been widowed. Emperor Guangwu discussed court officials with her, subtly gauging her inclinations. The Princess said, "Minister Song’s dignified bearing and virtuous capacity surpass all others." The Emperor replied, "I shall arrange it then."

Later, when Song Hong was summoned for an audience, the Emperor had the Princess sit behind a screen. He then said to Hong, "As the proverb goes: *The noble change their friends, the wealthy change their wives*—is this not human nature?" Hong replied, "Your servant has heard that *one must not forget friends from poverty and low station, nor cast aside a wife who shared hardship and coarse fare*." The Emperor turned to the Princess and said, "The matter will not proceed."

*Recorded:* This was the first step toward the eventual deposition of Empress Guo. "To serve as an official, one should aspire to be Commander of the Imperial Guard; to take a wife, one should seek a woman like Yin Lihua"—such was the Emperor’s early ambition, embodying the very proverb of *changing friends with nobility and wives with wealth*. Hong’s father had once been punished for refusing to ingratiate himself with Dong Xian; such principles had long been instilled in his household. How much more, then, should Hong’s restraint in rejecting extravagant music and resisting licentious beauty, so evident at court, have been known to the Emperor? Why did he still broach such a misguided proposal?

Yet even if the Emperor himself were not worth discussing, how could the Princess, as one who would become Lady Huyang, bear to have such a reputation spread to neighboring states? How could she bear it?

*The Old Book of Tang:* Empress Wende, née Changsun, was by nature benevolent, filial, and frugal, with a lifelong love of reading. She often discussed ancient affairs with the Emperor at leisure, offering counsel and corrections that greatly benefited governance. When her illness grew severe and she took leave of the Emperor, Fang Xuanling was dismissed from court under censure. The Empress said to the Emperor, "Xuanling has served Your Majesty long, with caution and discretion. Unless there is grave cause, I hope you will not cast him aside. I further urge you to draw near to the virtuous, distance the petty, accept loyal remonstrance, reject slander and malice, reduce corvée labor, and cease hunting expeditions. Though I may perish beneath the Nine Springs, I shall have no regrets."

She had once compiled examples of women’s conduct from antiquity, both successes and failures, into *The Women’s Code* in thirty scrolls. The Emperor read it and showed it to his close ministers, saying, "This book by the Empress is sufficient to serve as a model for a hundred generations." When she passed, the Emperor, though he knew the decree of Heaven, indulged in grief without profit. "Now that she is gone," he said, "I enter the palace and hear no more admonitions. I have lost a fine counselor—how can I forget her?"

When she was interred at Zhaoling, the Emperor’s longing for her did not cease. He had a multi-tiered tower built in the imperial park from which to gaze upon her tomb.

*Recorded:* When the Nine Ministers governed the outer realm and Jiang [Yuan] nurtured the inner, their teachings were of no small benefit. Alas, Emperor Taizong of Tang was not the equal of King Wu of Zhou—how could he have been free of fault? Before the queen and concubines were established and Cao Wang Ziming was enfeoffed, he feared only that he would no longer hear admonitions, hence his poignant gaze toward Zhaoling. But after the Lady Wu entered the palace, such earnest devotion would no longer be the same.

Taizong once said to Yu Chi Jingde, "I wish to marry my daughter to you. What do you think?" Jingde kowtowed and declined, saying, "Though my wife is coarse and unrefined, we have shared poverty and low station for many years. Though I am unlearned, I have heard that the ancients did not change their wives for wealth or rank. This is my wish as well." The Emperor approved and did not press the matter.

The Record states: Jingde was a fierce and valiant general—how could he have heard the subtle intent of the *feng* poets? In plain silk robes and hempen headscarves, he seemed far from the swift decisiveness of one who seizes spears, yet with but a single bolt of cloth ascending the six steps, he further displayed the intimacy of his sworn devotion. Compare this to Du He, Fang Yiai, Xue Wanche, and Chai Lingwu, who one after another married imperial princesses—what was there they could not have done, yet they instead brought ruin upon themselves. What was the reason for their downfall? "He who knows contentment is not disgraced; he who knows when to stop is not imperiled"—this was not merely about foreseeing and preventing trouble. Jingde surpassed even Fang [Xuanling] and Du [Ruhui] in this regard, ultimately preserving his integrity in his later years, living in ease and contentment, and alone keeping intact his reputation for propriety. In the exchanges between ruler and minister, they began well and ended well, without the slightest trace of suspicion or mistrust—was this not admirable? Alas!

In matters of the inner chambers, he could truly be called humane.

From *The Gazetteer of Lin’an*: The Reverent and Virtuous Lady of Wu-Yue, née Wu, named Hanyue, was a native of Qiantang. Her nature was gentle, kind, and benevolent. She served King Wenmu (Qian Yuanguang) with filial devotion, lived with constant frugality, and wore only plain cloth. Whenever she heard of harsh punishments being meted out, she would frown and speak of benevolence and forbearance. Among the various members of the Wu clan who received promotions...

All who sought audience with her from distant regions were sternly denied entry, and she often admonished and encouraged them; if any committed faults, she would reprove them to their faces. Thus, throughout her lifetime, none among them grew arrogant or self-indulgent.

The consort of King Zhongyi, née Sun, named Taizhen, was also a native of Qiantang. Her nature was upright, dignified, and keenly intelligent. Whenever she received her in-laws or the various members of the clan, she treated them all with utmost propriety. Fond of study, she read books and was well-versed in the *Mao Odes* and the *Analects of Lu*. She valued frugality and simplicity, and unless receiving official visits or paying respects, she never held lavish banquets. When King Shu was campaigning in Piling, Sun remained in the capital and dispatched palace attendants to comfort and inquire after the families of the generals and officers who had followed him on the expedition. Both within the court and beyond, all stood in awe of her, as though serving the king himself.

The record states: History praises the Qian clan for its enduring legacy, not merely for the virtue and favor it bestowed upon the region. For a century, they ruled with severity over their people, yet their descendants have flourished to this day, thriving without end—how vastly different from the sovereigns of the Five Dynasties! This was surely due to the worthy couples who governed their households, laying the foundation for such prosperity. Thus, it is recorded.

From *The History of the Song*: Empress Cao, the Benevolent and Sagely Empress Dowager of Emperor Renzong, was betrothed and entered the palace in the second year of the *Mingdao* era. In the first year of *Jingyou*, she was invested as empress, and in the first year of *Xining*, she was honored as Grand Empress Dowager. Her nature was profoundly kind and loving. Whenever Emperor Shenzong returned late from court, she would personally go to the screen of the imperial chamber to await and inquire after him, offering him broth with her own hands. Once, the emperor harbored intentions toward Yan and Ji and had already settled the matter with his ministers. He then went to the Qingshou Palace to inform her. The empress asked: "Are the reserves and bestowals prepared? Are the armor and weapons in order? Are the soldiers and officers well-trained?" The emperor replied, "All has been arranged."

The empress said: "This matter is of the utmost gravity—fortune and misfortune, regret and shame arise from action. Should we succeed, it would be no more than receiving congratulations as we face south. Yet if we fail, the fate of the living hangs in the balance, and the consequences defy easy description. If these lands could be taken, the Taizu and Taizong emperors would have reclaimed them long ago. Why wait until now?" The emperor replied, "I dare not disregard your counsel."

When Su Shi was imprisoned for his poetry and all believed he would surely die, the empress, though gravely ill, heard of it and said to the emperor: "I recall when your grandfather, Emperor Renzong, discovered the Su brothers through the imperial examinations and rejoiced, saying, *'I have secured two future prime ministers for my descendants.'* Now I hear Su Shi has been jailed for composing poetry—could this be the work of enemies slandering him? Even if his offense lies in verse, it is but a minor transgression. My illness grows severe, and I cannot bear to see injustice spread, lest it disrupt the harmony of the realm. You must examine this carefully." The emperor wept. Thus, Su Shi was spared.

It is recorded: Was it not fitting that she was called *Guangxian*? Her understanding of statecraft was truly worthy of an emperor. Her admonition on the matter of Yan and Ji, in particular, should serve as a model for all ages. Later, during Wang Shao’s campaign in Xihe and the boastful debates over the Xia state, war and strife spread, poisoning the lives of the people. The sins of Wang Anshi and Li Xian reached even to Heaven, while the compassionate and venerable empress had long since departed this world—yet still, the very calamities she foresaw came to pass. This shows how deeply such matters affect the order and security of the realm. Even in the matter of cherishing talent, one cannot help but sigh with sorrow. How fortunate Su Shi was! Had she wept for him only later, her voice would have come too late.

Empress Xuanzhao Shenglie Gao, wife of Emperor Yingzong, was the daughter of Quan Zunfu and Lady Cao, the elder sister of Empress Dowager Guangxian. From childhood, she often entered the inner palace. When Emperor Yingzong was raised within the palace, he and the future empress were of the same age. Emperor Renzong told Empress Dowager Guangxian, "She will surely be his match." As they grew, they were wed in the Palace of Pu, where she gave birth to the future Emperor Shenzong. In the second year of the *Zhiping* era, she was invested as empress. Emperor Shenzong later honored her as Empress Dowager, and upon Emperor Zhezong’s ascension, she was elevated to Grand Empress Dowager. She assumed regency and governed from the throne, first urgently summoning Sima Guang and Lü Gongzhu. Before their arrival, she appointed both as prime ministers, commanding them to work in harmony to assist the state. At once, all the renowned scholars of the age gathered at court. Every policy enacted since the *Xining* era that had proven harmful was systematically abolished. Thus, the *Green Sprouts* system was reformed based on the old regulations of the *Changshi* era, the *Jiayou* corvée system was reinstated alongside the recruitment of mercenaries, the *Market Exchange* laws were abolished, the tea monopoly was relaxed, and barren borderlands were ceded to the Western Rong tribes. The realm was once more at peace. She instructed border officials not to provoke the Khitan, saying, "The Southern Court has fully restored the reforms of Emperor Renzong." When officials proposed following the precedent of the *Tiansheng* era for the palace examination, requesting that both emperor and empress dowager preside from the rear of the hall, she forbade it. When they further requested that she receive the ceremonial tablets in the *Wende* Hall, she replied, "Do not."

Her presiding in the central position was not a commendable matter for the state. How could she occupy the emperor’s formal throne? The *Chongzheng* Hall would suffice. She also deemed the excess of officials to require reduction, and decreed that one-quarter of the favors granted to her maternal relatives be withdrawn to benefit the palace staff.

During her nine years of regency, the court was clear and bright, the realm pacified, and the old precedents rigorously observed. She suppressed imperial decrees issued from within the palace and rejected private favors to her family. The *Wensi* Institute’s offerings to the throne—whether great or small—went untouched throughout her lifetime. The court and the realm revered her as a Yao or Shun among women.

The record states: Yao and Shun were the paragons of sagely perfection—could such praise be applied to a female sovereign? For the Dao of Yao and Shun lies in moderation alone. Among the rulers of her time, the overzealous erred through excessive rigor, while the lax succumbed to indulgence and delusion. Who did not aspire to Yao and Shun’s example, yet dared not claim it? Yet this empress dowager truly nurtured the common people with benevolence, neither yielding to weakness nor overstepping firmness. She upheld the old ways with resolve, revoked the new laws, and the humble folk of the lanes and alleys emerged from fire and water to rest upon their mats. The petty schemers were cast out, and the old ministers of the court, as if parting clouds to see the blue sky, rejoiced.

Had succeeding emperors followed her path generation after generation, the blessings of Yao and Shun would have endured without end, and the vital essence of the Song would not have declined. Alas! Before the sacrificial rice was consumed, the state’s affairs were wholly overturned. The wicked triumphed, and even Yao and Shun could do nothing against them. Was this not because such an age does not often arise?

Empress Xiànshèng Xiànsù of Divine Reverence, consort to Emperor Shénzōng, entered the residence of Prince Yǐng in the third year of the Zhìpíng era. When the Prince of Yǐng ascended the imperial throne, she was established as Empress. Upon the accession of Emperor Zhézōng, she was honored as Empress Dowager. Empress Dowager Xuānrén ordered the renovation of the former palace of Qìngshòu for her residence, but she declined, saying: "How can a mother-in-law dwell in the west while the daughter-in-law resides in the east? This would confuse the proper order of superior and inferior." When members of her clan sought to exchange favors for official posts by precedent, or when others petitioned for promotions from local to capital ranks, she replied: "My family has never relied on such precedents. Why should private interests disrupt public affairs?" She refused every such request. When Emperor Zhézōng suddenly passed away, she alone made the critical decision, and no dissenting voices could obstruct it. Upon the accession of Emperor Huīzōng, she was asked to assume temporary regency, but she declined, citing the emperor’s maturity. Only after Huīzōng wept and bowed for some time did she consent. Throughout the reigns from Shàoshèng to Yuánfú, she gradually reinstated the worthy officials and scholar-officials who had been exiled. She abolished outdated customs such as avoiding the imperial ancestral taboo when holding court in the main hall, or establishing birth celebrations for the emperor. When she heard of measures like summoning retired elders, easing corvée labor, halting military campaigns, cherishing the people, and promoting frugality, her joy was evident. After just six months, she returned governance to the emperor.

The record states: Among the Song dynasty, four empresses shone with comparable brilliance, illuminating the annals of history. Observing their most virtuous deeds, none failed to prioritize the summoning of retired elders and the honoring of worthy scholars, while curbing private favors and restraining personal desires to love the people. Few since have matched their example. Alas! Truly, they were benevolent.

Empress Zhāocí Shèngxiàn Mèng, chosen by Empress Dowager Xuānrén and installed as Empress, faced calamity when Xuānrén passed away. Zhāng Dūn slandered Xuānrén and the empress, and secretly allied with Consort Liú to propose her replacement. With Hǎo Suí, they fabricated charges, enduring through the Chóngníng and Jìngkāng eras. When the Jurchen captured the capital, all titled consorts of the six palaces were taken north, but the deposed empress alone remained. Zhāng Bāngchāng honored her as Empress Dowager of Sòng and welcomed her to reside in Yánfú Palace, where she received the court’s homage and governed behind the screen. Learning that Prince Kāng was in Jì, she dispatched the Left and Right Vice Directors of the Department of State Affairs, Féng Yū and Lǐ Huí, along with her nephew Zhōnghòu, bearing a letter to welcome him. She ordered Commander Guō Zhòngxūn to lead his troops as an escort, and sent the commander of the Imperial Guard’s vanguard, Zhāng Jùn, to meet him en route. When the prince arrived in Nánjīng, she again sent the imperial clansman Shìliǎng and the eunuch Shào Érchē to present the imperial seals, regalia, and carriages, inviting Prince Kāng to ascend the throne. She was then honored as Empress Dowager Yuányòu and welcomed to the temporary court, where she lived until her passing.

Initially, when she was selected, Empress Dowager Xuānrén sighed: "This woman is virtuous and gentle, though her blessings are profound." She added: "If the state faces turmoil, she will surely bear the burden." All unfolded as she foretold.

The record states: In my humble view, the empresses Guāngxiàn, Xuānrén, and Qīnshèng conducted themselves like the gentle breeze of spring, harmonious and unassuming, following the emperor’s principles without pretense. Empress Zhāocí Mèng, however, was like autumn’s frost and dew—cleansed, she shone anew; obscured, she regained her brilliance. Yet all upheld the maternal virtues of the earth and the rites of feminine instruction, reflecting the accumulated blessings of the ancestral line. Was this not also the natural duty of empresses who cultivated virtue?

Sūn Míngfù lived in seclusion south of Mount Tài, already forty years old and dwelling alone. Chancellor Lǐ Dí, then serving as prefect of Yǎn, met him and sighed: "Sir, you live alone without a companion. Who will care for you in wind and rain, prepare your meals, or tend to you in illness?" He offered his younger brother’s daughter to serve as his wife. Míngfù firmly declined. Shí Jiè and his disciples pleaded: "For too long, high officials have neglected scholars. Now the chancellor, undeterred by your poverty and low status, wishes to entrust his niece to you, thereby demonstrating his own virtue." Thus, he married her. The Lǐ family embraced simplicity, serving their husband with utmost devotion. At the time, all scholar-officials praised them.

The record states: Observing Sūn Míngfù’s conduct, I lament that Lǐ Wén-dìng’s virtue is unattainable. Though a chancellor’s achievements may be unknowable, when governing a region, nothing surpasses the conduct of scholars and the refinement of customs. His wife’s marriage not only humbled the noble to honor the lowly, fulfilling one man’s goodness, but also addressed the fear of dying without heirs, nurturing the wellspring of great transformation. Moreover, it corrected the frivolity of shallow customs and preserved the lofty integrity of a reclusive scholar. Later, when Míngfù entered public service, he did not betray those who had recommended him. The Lǐ family, content in poverty and rich in propriety, honored their husband without shame. Both set an example for later generations.

Before Liú Tíngshì passed the imperial examinations, he had arranged to marry a local girl. After succeeding in the exams, the girl lost her sight to illness. Some urged him to marry her younger sister instead, but Tíngshì smiled: "My heart is already pledged. How could I betray my original intent?" He married her as promised, and they had several children. When his wife later died, Tíngshì, then serving as vice prefect of Mì Prefecture, did not remarry for over a year. At the time, Sū Shì was the prefect, and he asked: "Grief arises from love, and love arises from desire. Now, from what does your love arise, and from what does your grief emerge?" Tíngshì replied: "I know only that I have lost my wife. If love were born from desire, and grief from love, then when desire fades and love wanes, my grief would vanish too. Would that mean any woman who catches my eye on the street could become my wife?" Shì deeply admired his words.

The record states: Husband and wife are equals. Confucius said: "Beware of desire." And again: "I have never seen one who loves virtue as much as beauty." The Sage’s intent was to prevent desire from leading to licentiousness, thereby averting disaster and moderating excess. As the *Book of Songs* says: "Though they may be as numerous as clouds, they are not the ones I think of. In plain white robes and hempen sashes, they alone bring me joy."

If one such as Tíngshì may be said to love virtue and not be swayed by material desires, then had he advanced within the gate of Confucius, he would surely have earned the Sage’s profound approval—how could it be merely that Shì deeply admired him?

Zhōu Xíngjǐ, styled Gōngshū, passed the imperial examinations in his early years before the age of thirty. Observing Yíchuān’s austere self-discipline—secluded alone in his chamber, never once glancing at the courtyard or discussing the daughters of his mother’s kin—he took no wife. After passing the examinations, when he learned that a certain woman had gone blind in both eyes, he married her nonetheless, loving her more deeply than most men would. Yíchuān remarked: "Even I, at thirty, could not have done such a thing."

The record states: Yǎnchuān’s praise for Gōngshū carried the meaning of self-reflection and restraint, embodying the spirit of guiding others toward goodness. As for the one from Méishān, he was forever freed from the snares of emotion. Herein lies the division between the Luò and Shǔ schools—how could it be merely a matter of not singing while mourning or not mourning while singing?

Lǚ Zé sat for the imperial examinations and was betrothed to a woman from his hometown, though the marriage had not yet taken place. After he passed the examinations, the woman’s family said: "Our daughter had no illness before, but after the betrothal, she went blind." Zé replied: "You have not deceived me—what reason is there to refuse?" And so he married her.

She bore six sons, five of whom passed the imperial examinations, one being the Chancellor Dafang. Zé rose to the rank of Director in the Ministry of Personnel.

The record states: In reviewing the seven grounds for divorce, none mention blindness—thus, there was certainly no impediment to taking her as wife. Yet when it comes to severe illness or childlessness, there is a reluctance to act. Why? Within the inner chambers, affection outweighs duty. Though she was once free of illness, once afflicted, even a sage could not guarantee her health. Their bond was that of husband and wife; to abandon her in solitude would be unthinkable, even to a fool. Did the former kings, in establishing these regulations, truly not consider this? I suspect that in cases where a woman is barren or fails to conceive, or where a physician diagnoses her as "sterile," the verdict of "severe illness and childlessness" is applied without hesitation, leaving no room for doubt.

*The Ming Dynasty’s Official Biographies* records: Emperor Taizu’s empress, the virtuous and filial Ma, was from her youth serene, steadfast, and singular, her wisdom surpassing all expectations. After entering the palace, during years of great famine, she often endured hunger, saving dried meats and preserved fruits to offer the Emperor, ensuring he never lacked sustenance. The Emperor once remarked to his attendants: "Formerly, Emperor Guangwu thanked Feng Yi, saying, ‘Your kindness has long gone unanswered.’ I recall that the Empress rose from common origins, sharing hardship with me. In times of urgency, she would go hungry to feed me. Compared to the bean gruel and wheat porridge of old, our struggles were far harsher. When Emperor Taizong of Tang faced discord with his heir, Empress Changshun, within the palace, fulfilled her filial duties, carefully attending to the consorts, and dispelled resentment. I, however, was repeatedly suspected by the Guo clan, acting recklessly without regard. When soldiers presented gifts of clothing or goods, the Empress would first offer them to the Guos to soothe their feelings. When they sought to endanger me, she repeatedly mediated, ultimately averting disaster—a feat even more difficult than that of Changshun. A good wife in a household is like a good minister in a state; how could I forget her?"

One morning, the Emperor spoke of this to the Empress, who replied: "I have heard that it is easier for husband and wife to protect one another than for ruler and minister to do so. Since Your Majesty cannot bear to forget me in my humble origins, I pray you will not forget the common people in their hardship. Though I dare not compare myself to Empress Changshun in virtue, I only hope Your Majesty will take Yao and Shun as your model."

When her illness grew critical, the Emperor asked what she wished to say. The Empress replied: "May Your Majesty seek worthy counsel, heed remonstrance, clarify governance and education to bring about harmony, and instruct your sons to cultivate virtue and achievement." The Emperor said: "I have already taken this to heart, but how can I bear to part with you in my old age?" The Empress added: "Life and death are matters of fate. I only hope Your Majesty will remain vigilant to the end as you were at the beginning, that your descendants may all be virtuous, and that the people may find their place. Though I die, it will be as if I live on." With that, she passed away. The Emperor wept in grief and never again took another empress.

The record states: After the Three Dynasties came Han; after Tang and Song came Ming—their rise to power followed a similar pattern. Yet Empress Lü of Han and Empress Xiaoci Zhaoxian of Ming, though both aided their dynasties, were as different as ice and fire. How could Empress Lü of Han compare even to a fraction of the virtue of the Ming’s Empress Ma? Moreover, when our Emperor Taizu, out of righteousness, resolved never to take another empress, he stood worlds apart from the affair of Lady Qi. His filial piety in upholding Heaven’s mandate and his compliance with the sagely will may serve as a model for all ages.

*Hongdao Lu*, Volume Seven concludes.
*Hongdao Lu*, Volume Eight begins.

**On Brotherly Benevolence**

From the *Zuo Zhuan*: The Gao Yang clan had eight talented sons—Qi, Sheng, Guang, Yuan, Ming, Yun, Du, and Cheng—whom the world called the Eight Harmonious Ones. The Gao Xin clan had eight talented sons—Zhong, Su, Gong, Yi, Xuan, Ci, Hui, and He—whom the world called the Eight Excellencies. These sixteen clans perpetuated their virtues through the generations, preserving their names unblemished until the time of Yao. Yao could not employ Shun as his minister, but he appointed the Eight Harmonious Ones to oversee the earth, regulating all affairs. Nothing was out of order; the land was level, and Heaven’s work was complete. He also appointed the Eight Excellencies to spread the Five Teachings across the four directions: fathers righteous, mothers kind, elder brothers friendly, younger brothers respectful, and children filial. Thus, all was harmonious within and without. The *Book of Yu* recounts Shun’s achievements: "He carefully upheld the Five Constants, and the Five Constants were duly followed—no teachings were disobeyed. He entrusted them to the Hundred Administrators, and the Hundred Administrators were timely in their duties—no affairs were neglected."

The record states: The *Tongyi Qianbian* explains that the term "clan" here refers to a dynasty, meaning these two dynasties produced these sixteen men. It further clarifies that they were not born of a single mother with four births, like the Eight Officers of Zhou. Some, not understanding, mistakenly assume they were the sons of the two emperors. If so, how could the eight sons of Gao Yang have lived so long, and were the eight sons of Gao Xin all younger brothers of Yao? Let the reader consider this carefully.

Wan Zhang asked: "Xiang made killing Shun his business. When Shun became the Son of Heaven, he merely exiled Xiang. Why?" Mencius replied: "He enfeoffed him." Some say: "He exiled him." A benevolent man toward his younger brother does not harbor anger or nurse grudges; he simply cherishes him. To cherish him is to wish him honor; to love him is to wish him wealth. Enfeoffing him with Youbi gave him both wealth and honor. If one is the Son of Heaven while his brother remains a commoner, can this truly be called cherishing and loving him?

The record states: Zheng Zhuang’s treatment of his younger brother, Shu Duan, exemplifies harboring anger. Duke Xian of Jin’s treatment of Huan and Zhuang exemplifies nursing grudges. Not only did he harbor anger, but he also swore never to see his mother again at Chengying. Not only did he nurse grudges, but he also cursed that none of the ducal sons should be raised. The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: "When brothers are in harmony, their joy and delight are profound." It also says: "Thus, parents are at peace." Yet if one cannot be kind to an arrogant younger brother, how can one rectify the heart of the stubborn and unyielding?

From the *Major Odes* of the *Book of Songs*: "The Emperor established states and appointed lords, beginning with Tai Bo and King Ji. This King Ji, following his heart, befriended his elder brother, deeply cherishing their bond. Thus, he was granted radiant blessings, received blessings without loss, and eventually possessed the four directions."

The record states: Confucius said: "Tai Bo may be called a man of utmost virtue. Thrice he yielded the world, yet the people could find no words to praise his humility." The commentators explain: "There was nothing to praise in his yielding, for it was so subtle and unobtrusive as to be invisible." Yet when we examine the poet’s words—"King Ji’s friendship with his elder brother arose naturally from his heart, not from compulsion"—does this not imply that Tai Bo’s yielding to his younger brother was not natural but required effort? If so, how could others perceive it, and how could they praise it? It is self-evident without needing the phrase "subtle and unobtrusive."

From the *Minor Odes* of the *Book of Songs*: "Tall stands the mugwort, heavy with dew. Having met this lord, how joyful and at ease! Fitting as elder brother, fitting as younger brother, may they together enjoy virtue and longevity. Orderly flows the stream, dark and deep the Southern Mountains. Like bamboo they are firmly rooted, like pines they flourish. Elder and younger brothers, ever in good relations, never deceiving one another."

The record states: These two poems precisely address the flaws of the Seven States of Han. Consider Liu An of Huainan, who loved guests, and Yuan of Chu, who prepared sweet wine—were these not joyful occasions? Yet lacking the virtue of ease, they ultimately failed to attain happiness and longevity. Later, they cast coins from mountains and boiled the sea for salt, recruiting fugitives and harboring rebels. Their schemes multiplied endlessly, only hastening their downfall. And this was not merely about succession or mutual suspicion.

From the *Records of the Grand Historian*: Bo Yi and Shu Qi were the two sons of the Lord of Guzhu. Their father wished to enthrone Shu Qi. After their father’s death, Shu Qi yielded to Bo Yi. Bo Yi said: "It was our father’s command." And so he fled. Shu Qi likewise refused the throne and fled. The people of the state then enthroned the middle son. Zigong asked: "What manner of men were Bo Yi and Shu Qi?" Confucius replied: "They were worthy men of old." "Did they harbor resentment?" "They sought benevolence and attained it. What resentment could there be?"

The record states: Someone asked: "Why have later generations not matched the yielding of Bo Yi and Shu Qi?" I replied: "Matters that have no precedent arise naturally from Heaven and Earth, and thus are never flawed. Those with a precedent are later shaped by human deliberation and calculation, and thus vary endlessly. Bo Yi and Shu Qi, regarding their father’s command, acted according to principle without thought of later consequences. Later men, in their dealings with brothers, feign virtue to create affairs, deliberately seeking the reputation of the ancients. This is why they differ—and why disorder arises from it."

From the *Book of Zhou*: Two years after conquering Shang, King Wu fell gravely ill. The Duke of Tai and the Duke of Shao said: "Let us divine for the king’s well-being." The Duke of Zhou replied: "We must not distress our former kings." He then performed a ritual for himself, constructing three altars on a single platform. On the southern altar, facing north, the Duke of Zhou stood. Holding a jade tablet and grasping a scepter, he addressed Tai Wang, Wang Ji, and King Wen. The scribe then read from the prayer text: "Your eldest grandson, so-and-so, has contracted a severe and cruel illness..."

"If you, the Three Kings, bear the great responsibility of a son toward Heaven, then let me, Dan, take the place of so-and-so’s person."

He then divined with three tortoises, and each divination repeated the same auspicious result. Upon opening the lock and examining the oracle texts, all proved favorable. The Duke said: "The king’s person shall suffer no harm." He then placed the prayer tablets into a golden casket.

The king’s condition improved and he recovered. After King Wu passed away, Guan Shu spread rumors among the royal brothers throughout the state, saying: "The Duke intends harm to the young heir."

The Duke of Zhou then addressed the two dukes: "If I do not act, I will have nothing to report to our former kings." The Duke of Zhou remained in the east for two years, until the guilty were apprehended.

He then composed a poem to present to the king, saying:
*O turtledove, magpie,*
*You have taken my fledglings—*
*Do not destroy my nest.*
*With toil and care I labored,*
*Grieving for my young ones’ plight.*

*Before Heaven’s darkening rain,*
*I stripped the mulberry bark,*
*Mending windows and doors.*
*Now you, the people below,*
*Dare to mock and slight me.*

*My hands are chapped and calloused,*
*From gathering bitter herbs,*
*From storing my harvest.*
*My mouth is parched and cracked—*
*I have no home to shelter me.*

*My feathers are frayed and thin,*
*My tail is worn and ragged,*
*My nest sways precariously.*
*Tossed by wind and rain,*
*I can only cry out in distress.*

The record states: Though the king and his uncles held the distinction of ruler and subject, the Duke regarded them as limbs of one body—thus all were the same. When the king died, he acted in his stead; when the uncles rebelled, he punished them—was there any difference in his resolve? None at all.

For whether through blindness or madness, though the degrees of kinship may vary, their threat to the royal house was the same. Thus, if the young heir is secure, the people will have no cause for doubt; if the young heir is imperiled, the people will have no one to respect.

In this light, was there any difference in the sage’s heart—whether holding jade tablets and scepters or wielding broken axes and shattered halberds? His compassion for the people remained the same, regardless of circumstance.

It is further said: The term *yí* (贻) signifies transmission, the means by which intent is conveyed. Rumors arise from obscurity, without root or foundation. If one remains silent and does not speak, should the royal house suddenly face calamity, who would know? And who would act?

Could a benevolent man truly remain thus? Yet if one speaks only out of expediency, and the noble kin suddenly face ruin, could this be endured? What could be more unbearable? A benevolent man does not act in such a way.

Now, observing his words—they were not urgent, yet their meaning reached its mark alone.

Should a child of five feet in height hear these words, would they not know that the malice of crows and magpies cannot be undone, and that the toil of sawing and hewing is to be trusted? Such is the depth of their power to move, surpassing even the most earnest sincerity.

In their choice of words and comparison of events, they are like the wind stirring all things. Yet when Heaven’s thunder and lightning are borne by the wind, do they arise without cause?

In the *Zuozhuan*, it is recorded that during the Li Ji Disturbance, Jin cursed itself, vowing never to retain the sons of its former lords. From then on, Jin had no *gongzu* (ducal clansmen). When Duke Cheng ascended, he ennobled the legitimate son of Xiang and granted him fields, establishing him as *gongzu*. He also ennobled Xiang’s other sons as *yuzǐ* (secondary clansmen), and his lesser sons as *gongxíng* (ducal attendants). Thus, Jin once more had *gongzu*, *yuzǐ*, and *gongxíng*.

Zhao Xuanzi requested that Kuo be made *gongzu*, saying: “My lord is the beloved son of the Ji clan. Without the Lady Ji, your servant would be but a Di barbarian.” The duke consented, making Xuanzi the head of the *nichē* (chariot-escort) clan and appointing Ping Ji to oversee them, while designating Xuanzi’s former clan as *gongzu dafu* (ducal clansmen ministers).

The record states: Zhao Xuanzi’s plea for his clan was stirred by the Ji clan’s plea for its legitimate heir. Yet though the legitimate heir was proclaimed, the Zhao clan’s lineage endured through Kuo, while the clan of the legitimate heir perished. Where, then, was the *nichē*? Where was the *gongzu*? Thus the noble man values having sons.

When Han Xianzi retired, he sought to establish Muzi as *gongzu*. Muzi, afflicted with illness, declined, saying: “As the *Book of Songs* says, ‘If one does not attend to matters personally, the common people will not trust.’ I, Wuji, am unworthy—pray establish Qi instead.” Qi had befriended Tian Su and was known for his love of benevolence. The *Book of Songs* says: “Be reverent in your office, love uprightness—then the spirits will heed you and grant you great blessings.” To show compassion for the people is virtue; to be upright is rectitude; to harmonize both is benevolence. If one acts thus, the spirits will heed, blessings will descend, and one’s establishment will be assured. Xianzi then retired from court.

The lord of Jin, deeming Han Wuji benevolent, appointed him to oversee the *gongzu* as *gongzu dafu*.

The record states: Han and Zhao were the mighty arms of the Three Jin. Thus Xianzi did not forsake Zhao Meng, recognizing his understanding of righteousness. Qi and Dun were the great trees of their noble houses, so Wuji did not place Han Qi first, valuing his hidden benevolence. Yet righteousness must be established before benevolence. The proclamation of the legitimate heir and the elevation of Xuan Meng served to transform Muzi; the enfeoffment of Ping Ji and the clan’s restoration moved Duke Dao. The *Book of Songs* says: “Though their line was not illustrious, their plans were steadfast.” Was this not the reason for the Three Jin’s prosperity and the division of Quwo?

When Duke Mu of Song fell ill, he summoned the Grand Marshal Kong Fu and entrusted him with Duke Shang, saying: “Our late lord passed over Yu Yi to establish me. I dare not forget. If, by your grace, I may preserve my life until its end, and our late lord should ask about Yu Yi, what answer could I give? I beg you to serve him as lord of the altars of soil and grain. Though I die, I will have no regrets.”

Kong Fu replied: “The ministers wish to serve Feng.”

The duke said: “That will not do. Our late lord deemed me worthy and made me lord of the altars. If I abandon virtue and refuse to yield, I would undo our late lord’s act. How could I claim worthiness? Should I not strive to illuminate our late lord’s virtuous power?” He urged Kong Fu: “Do not forsake our late lord’s merit.” Thus, he sent Prince Feng to reside in Zheng.

On the *gengchen* day of the eighth month, Duke Mu of Song died, and Duke Shang ascended the throne.

The noble man says: Duke Xuan of Song could be called one who knew men. He established Duke Mu, and his son reaped the reward, for he acted with righteousness.

The record states: Duke Xuan’s transfer of the state to Duke Mu was deemed “knowing men” by Zuo, but “the beginning of disaster” by *Gongyang*. How is one to reconcile this? When Yao recommended Shun, and Shun recommended Yu, they had already heeded Heaven’s mandate. Yet in their court audiences, legal judgments, and musical performances, they never failed to win the people’s trust—even extending to Yi. With Qi, however, it was otherwise: court audiences, legal judgments, and musical performances were not directed to Yi but to Qi. Qi said: “I am the son of our lord.” The affairs of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Yi arose from Heaven’s natural mandate and the impartiality of Heavenly principle—hence their endurance for ten thousand generations without flaw. The affairs of Mu, Xuan, Yi, and Feng stemmed from the passions of preference and the selfishness of “you” and “me”—hence their failure within two transmissions. Yet Kong Fu’s acceptance of the mandate was nobler than Zhao Pu’s repeated insistence; and Prince Feng’s residence in Zheng was better than De Fang’s breach of covenant. Duke Mu could be said not to have betrayed his original intent.

When Duke Huan of Song fell ill, Crown Prince Zi Fu urgently requested: “Mu Yi is both elder and benevolent—pray establish him.” The duke commanded Zi Yu. Zi Yu declined, saying: “What could be greater than yielding the state to a benevolent man? I am not his equal.” He then fled and withdrew.

When Duke Xiang of Song ascended, he deemed Prince Mu Yi benevolent and appointed him Left Minister to oversee governance. Thus, Song was well-ordered, and the Yu clan perpetually held the office of Left Minister.

The record states: Duke Mu passed over Feng to establish Yu Yi, confounding the bond between father and son—hence the eventual usurpation and regicide. Mu Yi firmly insisted on establishing Zi Fu, upholding the proper order between brothers—hence the achievement of Song’s good governance. Yet why did they vie in yielding as a matter of righteousness? Was it to outdo one another in reputation? In essence, when a father dies, the son succeeds—this is the constant way of ten thousand generations. When an elder brother dies, the younger succeeds—this is a temporary expedient. To treat the extraordinary as ordinary and the expedient as constant is but disorder.

Gongsun Ao of Lu married a woman of Ju, who bore Wen Bo. Her elder sister, Sheng Ji, bore Hui Shu. After Dai Ji died, he sought another bride from Ju. The people of Ju offered Sheng Ji, but he instead arranged for Xiang Zhong to betroth her. Upon seeing her beauty from the city wall, he took her for himself, and his entire household fled to Ju to join the Ji clan.

The people of Lu enthroned their eldest son, Gu, who became known as Wen Bo. When Wen Bo fell ill, he petitioned, saying: "My son Gu is young; I request that Nan be installed instead." His request was granted. After Wen Bo’s death, Hui Shu was enthroned.

The record states: In the reign of Duke Wen of Lu, the legitimate heir was slain and the concubine-born son installed—yet there was the yielding between Gu and Nan. The noble man may well feel shame before Xiang Zhong, yet in the end could not escape the calamity of ruin. As the *Tradition* says: "A lord begins with this, and ends with this." The killings by Qing Fu of Ban and Min, and by Xiang Zhong of E and Shi—these are one and the same. Thus, though one may wish not to die, how can one avoid death?

The *Book of Han* records: King De of Hejian was the elder brother of Emperor Wu. He cultivated learning and cherished antiquity, seeking truth in facts. When he obtained fine books from the people, he would have them copied and returned to their owners, keeping the originals and rewarding them with gold and silk. Thus, scholars of the Dao and arts from all directions, though they might come from a thousand *li* away, or possess ancient texts handed down from their ancestors, presented them in tribute. As a result, he amassed a great many books. All were pre-Qin ancient scripts, such as the *Rites of Zhou*, the *Book of Documents*, the *Rites*, the *Record of Rites*, the *Mencius*, and the *Laozi*—all classics and commentaries. The explanations and records of the seventy disciples’ discussions on their studies encompassed the Six Arts. He established the Mao *Odes* and the Zuo *Spring and Autumn Annals* as official teachings, refined ritual and music, donned the robes of Confucian scholars, and in all matters, however trivial, deferred to the Ru. Many Ru from the eastern mountains followed and studied under him. During Emperor Wu’s reign, he came to court, presented refined music at the Three Sacred Halls, and answered over thirty questions in the imperial edict. His responses, grounded in the Dao and its safeguards, struck the heart of affairs—concise in wording, clear in intent.

When he had reigned for twenty-six years, he passed away. The Chief Commandant Chang Li reported this, saying: "The king’s person was upright in conduct, his governance temperate, benevolent, reverent, and frugal. He was deeply respectful and loving toward his subjects, discerning and profoundly perceptive, and showed kindness to the widowed and orphaned." The posthumous eulogy, following the *Law of Posthumous Titles*, read: "Intelligent, enlightened, wise, and sagacious." It was decreed: "Let him be called *Xian*." Thus, he was titled Prince Yi of Mi.

The record states: Since the Western Han dynasty, when the custom of mocking and reviling the Ru arose, of the hundreds of princes enfeoffed over the generations, most grew arrogant, licentious, and lost the Dao, becoming perverse, rebellious, and wicked in every conceivable way. Was this truly because Heaven had bestowed upon them such disparate natures? Rather, it was the circumstances that ensnared and drowned their hearts. What fault, then, did the Ru bear before the world? The standards set by the Two Emperors and Three Kings for later generations are fully recorded in the classics. This prince’s person was upright in conduct, his governance temperate, benevolent, reverent, and frugal. Compared to those who found comfort in poison and profit in peril and ruin, how vast was the difference! The histories praise the *Greater Ya* as towering and peerless—only the princes of the Hejian region approached such distinction. He may truly be called benevolent.

According to the *Book of Later Han*: Liu Qiang, Prince Gong of Donghai, was the son of Empress Guo and the elder brother of Emperor Ming. In the second year of the Jianwu era, he was established as Crown Prince. In the seventeenth year, when Empress Guo was deposed, Qiang was often sorrowful and ill at ease. He repeatedly petitioned through his attendants and other princes, expressing his earnest sincerity and desire to serve as a vassal prince to provide for his mother. Emperor Guangwu could not bear this, and the matter remained unresolved for several years. In the sixth month of the nineteenth year, an edict was issued: "Crown Prince Qiang has long upheld humility and restraint. The bond between father and son is profound, and to separate them for so long has been difficult. Let Qiang be made Prince of Donghai, and let Yang be established as Crown Prince."

Yuan Hong remarked: "Donghai’s submission as a vassal state revealed a heart of filial reverence all the more radiant. When Emperor Ming ascended the throne, the affection between brothers grew even deeper. Though their fates differed—one rising, the other demoted—their innate love as father and son and brothers remained unquestionable."

The record states: In observing the successive sovereigns who inherited the mandate, I see that they often took past events as mirrors. The change of the Crown Prince was precisely a response to the hardships of the times. Had Emperor Ming’s virtue not been foreseen in the former Han, would the realm not have been shaken? In the first year of the Yongping era, Qiang indeed passed away from illness. Though the emperor had long anticipated this, he was ultimately able to preserve his heartfelt love. Such fraternal affection may well be what the *Odes* calls "profound blessing."

Liu Cang, Prince Xian of Dongping, was Emperor Ming’s younger brother. Emperor Ming held him in deep affection. In the eleventh year of the Yongping era, he came to court and, after a month’s stay, returned to his fief. The emperor personally saw him off. Upon returning to the palace, he was overcome with melancholy longing and dispatched envoys bearing a handwritten edict to the Dongping kingdom. The edict read: "Since parting, I have sat alone in sorrow. I went to my carriage, leaned upon the crossbar, and sang, gazing into the distance with longing—truly, it wearies my heart. Some time ago, I asked the prince what was most joyful in managing a household. The prince replied that doing good was the greatest joy. His words were grand, and they matched his true intent. Now, I send nineteen seals for the various marquises. All sons aged five and above who can bow and pay respects shall be permitted to wear them."

The record states: Dongping’s delight in goodness is a tale of beauty for the ages. The princes of old were ever diligent—this diligence was a virtue, meaning goodness, trustworthiness, and fulfillment. Those who sought to attract officials and wandering scholars, whose fame and reputation shone brightly, did not embody such goodness, trustworthiness, or fulfillment. Were they like those who forged golden turtles, jade cranes, inscribed talismans, and fabricated auspicious omens? The emperor’s praise for his words was indeed well-founded.

Some say: "Doing good as the greatest joy means acting without ulterior motive. When one acts without ulterior motive, what could one not achieve?" Jiang Kengbo, Huai, and their younger brother Jiang Jijiang, of an illustrious lineage, were all renowned for their filial piety. Their fraternal love was innate and profound. They often went out together, and even after each took a wife, their mutual affection remained so strong that they could not bear to live apart. As the succession to the lineage was at stake, they took turns visiting each other’s chambers. Jiang Gong was broadly learned in the Five Classics and well-versed in astral and apocryphal texts. Many scholars from afar came to study under him, and though he was repeatedly summoned to office, he declined every appointment. His two brothers, equally renowned, also refused all offers of employment. The people admired them. Emperor Huan of the Later Han then dispatched artisans to Pengcheng to paint their likenesses and report back. Gong concealed himself in seclusion, covering his face with a quilt and claiming to suffer from dizziness and an aversion to wind, so that the artisans never saw him.

The record states: Gong’s steadfast conduct was truly remarkable. The *Odes* say: "Though she had seven sons, none could console their mother’s heart." Gong may be called one who could console his mother’s heart. Those who embody sagely goodness move others through their words, while those who wield whips and rods compel obedience through their demeanor.

Those who conceal their eagerness for reclusion invite the very summons they seek to avoid; those who exhaust their vessels in shameful succession suffer the pain of their past missteps. Thus, though mother and son dwelt in separate chambers, the brothers shared a single quilt—yet their words never faltered. Though a mother’s kindness and a younger brother’s love arose naturally from the heart, leaving no trace in their countenance, their conduct spoke plainly. No summons reached their ears, nor did they partake in the calamities of their clan—thus they avoided the very conflicts they might have provoked. They served their mother with devotion until her death, preserving their integrity in pristine wholeness—thus they spared themselves the pain of regret. Measured against the standards of Confucius’ disciples, could they not be called those who "found joy in poverty"?

According to the *Book of Xie Cheng*: Gong’s stepmother was young and stern of disposition. Moved by the righteousness of the *"Kai Feng"* ode, the brothers shared a single quilt and never entered her private chambers, all to console their mother’s heart. The *Book of Jin* records: Wang Xiang’s younger brother, Wang Lan, suffered his mother Zhu’s cruel treatment of Xiang. When Lan was but a few years old, he would weep and cling to Xiang whenever he saw him beaten. As he grew older, he constantly admonished his mother, gradually curbing her violence. Zhu repeatedly forced Xiang and Lan to act against reason, and wherever she sent Xiang, Lan followed. When she abused Xiang’s wife, Lan’s wife would rush to join her. After their father’s death, Xiang’s conduct grew increasingly irreproachable, and Zhu grew to detest him. She secretly poisoned his wine, but Lan learned of it and seized the cup before Xiang could drink. Xiang hesitated, but Zhu snatched it back and drank it herself. Thereafter, whenever Zhu offered Xiang food, Lan would taste it first, and Zhu, fearful, ceased her schemes. Lan’s filial piety, fraternal devotion, reverence, and prudence were nearly equal to Xiang’s. When Xiang entered official service, Lan also accepted his home commandery’s summons.

Earlier, Lü Qian possessed a ceremonial blade, and a diviner had declared that only one destined for the rank of the Three Excellencies could rightfully wear it. If bestowed upon the unworthy, the blade might bring misfortune. Believing Xiang possessed the capacity for the highest offices, Lü Qian gave it to him. As Xiang lay dying, he bequeathed it to Lan, saying, "Your descendants will surely prosper and prove worthy of this blade." Indeed, their lineage flourished with virtue and rose to prominence in the lands east of the Yangtze. Lan had six sons: Cai, styled Shichu, who served as Chief Clerk to the General-in-Chief; Ji, styled Shixian, who was Investigating Censor; Hui, styled Shihe, who was Imperial Censor; Zheng, styled Shize, who was Gentleman of the Palace; Yan, styled Shizhi, who was Central Protector; and Chen, styled Shizhang, who was Libationer of the National University. Cai’s son, Dao, became a renowned chief minister.

The record states: Xiang’s service to his parents left nothing to be desired, while Lan’s devotion to his elder brother was beyond reproach. Their father’s neglect had its reasons, but their mother’s cruelty knew no cause. Yet in the end, they gathered filial sons and fraternal brothers under one roof, and auspicious harmony flourished in their descendants. This was Heaven’s way of perfecting the reputations of these two men and extending the Jin dynasty’s reign for generations. Lü Qian’s tale may not be entirely credible, yet was it not akin to the omen of the golden ox? Though Yuan later received the Mandate, it was Dao who laid its foundations—the signs were already apparent. Could this not be the response to virtue’s influence?

From the *Old Book of Tang*: Prince Song, Chengqi, and Prince Shen, Chengyi, were Emperor Xuanzong’s elder brothers. Prince Qi, Fan, and Prince Xue, Ye, were his younger brothers. Prince You, Shouli, was his cousin. The emperor cherished them with a fraternal affection unmatched in recent ages. In the early years of the Shengli era, when they left the palace to reside in separate mansions, they were granted estates in the Jishan Ward of the eastern capital, where the five brothers lived together in divided courtyards. In the first year of the Dazu era, they accompanied the emperor on his journey to the western capital and were bestowed residences in the Xingqing Ward. After the *Xiantian* era, the Xingqing estate—once the emperor’s private residence during his years in obscurity—was converted into a palace, with a tower erected in its southwest corner. On its western face was inscribed: *The Tower Where Flowers and Calyxes Shine Upon One Another*; on its southern face: *The Tower of Diligence in Governance and Devotion to Fundamentals*. Whenever the emperor heard the music of the princes, he would summon them to ascend the tower, where they feasted together on the same couch. At times, he would visit their mansions, bestowing gold and silks to deepen their joy. Prince Song, in particular, was reverent, cautious, and circumspect, never presuming to interfere in state affairs or form improper alliances. Thus, the emperor held him in especial esteem, once writing to him: “Emperor Wen of Wei composed a poem: *The western mountain rises high, / Its summit boundless in the sky. / Two immortal youths dwell there, / Neither eating nor drinking, yet fair. / They granted me a pill of light, / Radiant with five colors bright. / After four or five days’ grace, / My body grew light as a feathered race.* Yet I often ponder: what is the elixir that grants wings compared to the wings of flesh-and-blood brothers, bestowed by Heaven itself? Of old, Cao Zhi possessed the talent to succeed his father and the ability to govern, yet Emperor Wen barred him from court, driving him to die of sorrow. Before the Wei’s mandate was spent, it was usurped by Sima Xuanwang—was this the efficacy of the divine pill? Even the sagely Emperor Shun forgave the faults of his arrogant brother Xiang. This is the model for rulers, and I have never ceased to reflect upon it with admiration, often forgetting even to eat. Recently, I obtained this divine formula during my leisure. Now, I share this elixir with you, my brothers, that we may together preserve our longevity without end.”

The record states: In the *Yi Jing*, the ninth line of *Yi* reads: *“Sincere trust, a kind heart—ask not, for supreme fortune is assured. Sincere trust enriches my virtue.”* The *Xiang* commentary says: *“Sincere trust and a kind heart—ask not. Enriching my virtue, great is the fulfillment of will.”* Emperor Xuanzong’s achievements were vast and his virtue eminent, while the five princes responded with humility and compliance, aligning with the correctness of Heaven’s principle and the peace of human hearts. As limbs trust one another and hearts and qi resonate in harmony, the bonds of fraternal love arose naturally. In that era, the altars of state stood secure, the common people rejoiced, and great goodness and fortune were self-evident without need for inquiry. Since they harbored utmost sincerity and cherished his virtue, he was able to unfold his strategies, expand the Way of governance, and fully realize the aspirations of a great sovereign. Thus, the governance of the *Kaiyuan* era rivaled even that of the *Zhenguan* reign. What need was there for further question?

From the *Book of Tang*: Zhang Gongyi maintained nine generations of his family under one roof, a harmony comparable to that of the Qi state. Since the Sui and Tang dynasties, his household had been honored with imperial commendations. During the Linde era, Emperor Gaozong, while on his eastern progress to Mount Tai, visited Gongyi’s residence. Summoning him, the emperor inquired about the secret to his family’s harmony. Gongyi requested paper and brush to respond. He wrote the character *ren* (忍, forbearance) over a hundred times, conveying his meaning: discord in a clan arises when elders’ provisions are unequal or when juniors neglect propriety, leading to mutual reproach and strife. If all could practice forbearance, the household would flourish in harmony.

The record states: Forbearance is the heart of not being unbearable. The heart of not being unbearable is the heart of Heaven. A clan spanning nine generations is a matter of Heaven-endowed nature. Applying the heart of not being unbearable to an unchanging lineage, one regards the nine clans as a single person and nine generations as a single day. What could they not share together? Yet if forbearance is merely enforced by coercion, without the practice of compassion and love among them, then such forbearance is but a blade that wounds the heart. Zhang Gongyi’s intent was surely not of this kind.

Yuan Dexiu, styled Zizhi, was a man of simple sincerity who ate no meat in his youth. As he had not yet married while his parents were alive, he refused to take a wife afterward. Others said this would cut off his descendants.

Yuan Dexiu replied, "My elder brother has a son—our ancestors’ sacrifices are already secured. Why should I marry?" When his brother’s son came of age, he sought to arrange a marriage for him, but the family was mired in poverty, so he petitioned to become magistrate of Lushan. During Emperor Xuanzong’s revelry at the Five Phoenix Tower in the eastern capital, he commanded that all county magistrates and prefects within three hundred *li* gather with their musicians. Dexiu sent dozens of musicians, who linked arms and sang in unison. The emperor, hearing of this, marveled and sighed, "Truly the words of a worthy man!" All the salary he received, he spent on clothing and feeding the orphaned and destitute. When his term ended, he departed. Fond of the fine mountains and waters of Luhun, he settled there. He built no walls or gates, and his household had no servants or concubines. In years of famine, he might go without cooking a meal, yet he would play the zither with serene delight. He was especially skilled in literary composition. Fang Guan would often sigh, saying, "To see Zizhi’s countenance is to have all thoughts of fame and profit extinguished." Su Yuanming told others, "Born into this degenerate age, the one thing I do not regret is having known Yuan Zizhi." When he died, his younger brother Jie wept for him in inconsolable grief. Someone said, "Your mourning exceeds the bounds of propriety." Jie replied, "You speak of exceeding propriety, but you do not understand the depth of my feeling. A gentleman in youth has no fixed attachments, in maturity no rigid preferences, in old age no lingering ties, and in death no surplus. All the passions and indulgences that enthrall others—the gentleman was free of them. He lived sixty years without ever knowing the allure of feminine beauty, never owned ten *mu* of land, ten feet of a house, or a ten-year-old servant. He never wore whole cloth nor ate a meal with all five flavors. I mourn him to warn those sunk in dissipation, greed, flattery, and extravagance."

The record states: Observing Huishan’s character, he stood vast as the empty heavens, without a speck of dust to cloud him; he flowed deep as a limpid abyss, without a grain of sediment to sully him. That he personally nursed his brother’s child is a deed so rare in ancient or modern times as to defy emulation. Thus, it is not recorded here.

Yet *The Jin History* records that his disciple Gui wore mourning for three years, while *The Tang History* neither names Luzhan’s brother’s son nor mentions any observance of mourning rites—merely noting Cishan’s grief as extraordinary. In essence, grief is an expression of feeling, while mourning is an enactment of duty. Measured by the twin principles of compassionate nurture and the absence of posterity, the obligation to observe mourning is self-evident. Can it truly be that the histories are deficient in their records?

*The Song History* states: Emperor Taizu was by nature benevolent and filial, his character artless and unforced. When his younger brother, Prince Jin of Guangyi, fell gravely ill, the emperor personally went to attend him and applied moxa with his own hand. The prince, sensing the burn, winced in pain, whereupon the emperor took the moxa and applied it to himself, sharing in his brother’s suffering. In private conversation with his ministers, he often remarked: “Prince Jin moves with the stride of a dragon and the bearing of a tiger; one day he shall be a sovereign of a peaceful realm. His fortune and virtue surpass anything I possess.”

The record states: At the Chenqiao Incident, Prince Jin and his generals took the lead, and only afterward did the emperor learn of what had transpired—truly the first step in severing the Shang. Yet the dragon’s stride and tiger’s bearing were already manifest in the radiance of his countenance. And the act of sharing pain through moxa further confirmed his destiny as a sovereign of peace and virtue. As for the axe’s echo in the candlelight—Monk Wenyin lightly recorded it, awaiting Li Shou’s account, while Li Shou transmitted the doubt, leaving Hu Chen to lament. These two, being from Qiongshan, relied solely on the standard histories to refute the slander.

In my view, later generations sought to substantiate Taizong’s crimes solely on the grounds of his later treatment of his younger brother. Thus, they first cast suspicion on his regard for his elder brother and his feelings toward his nephew, ultimately imputing to him the sin of regicide. Yet Taizu’s benevolence and filial piety were innate and unfeigned; even if he had a worthless son, how could he have stooped to such an act? This record, grounded in reason, sets the matter right, and thus I have ventured to argue the case.

Fan Wenzhenggong admonished his sons: “When I was poor, your mother and I cared for my parents. Your mother personally prepared the meals, yet the delicacies we offered never fully satisfied them. Now, having attained high office and generous emoluments, I wish to provide for my parents, but they are no longer here, and your mother has also passed away long ago. What I most regret is that I cannot bear to let you alone enjoy the pleasures of wealth and rank.

Among my clan in Wu Prefecture, I have far more relatives than most. Though there are degrees of kinship, in the eyes of our ancestors, all are equally their descendants, without distinction. If our ancestors made no such distinctions, how can I fail to succor those who suffer hunger and cold? Moreover, our family has accumulated virtue for over a hundred years, and only now has it manifested in me, elevating me to high office. If I alone enjoy wealth and rank while neglecting my clan, how shall I face our ancestors in the underworld? What countenance shall I have to enter the ancestral temple?”

Thereupon, he ensured that his stipends and gifts were regularly distributed among his kinsmen. From his surplus salary, he purchased a thousand *mu* of fertile land near the capital, naming it the “Charitable Estate.”

The record states: This was Wenzhenggong’s aspiration before attaining office and his practice after attaining it. Since the invention of writing, only he has achieved such distinction. In pondering the reasons, I find four: first, the impartiality of his heart; second, the virtue of his successive generations; third, the generosity of the prevailing customs; and fourth, the sagacity of the sovereign’s virtue.

From his days as a scholar, he was “the first to worry for the realm’s troubles and the last to enjoy its pleasures.” Such insight naturally gave rise to such magnanimity—this was the impartiality of his heart. His son, Pure Jade, inherited his resolve and carried on his work; how could he not have made his father’s impartiality his own? This was the virtue of his successive generations.

Today, were one to purchase a thousand *mu* of fertile land near the capital, not only would envious slander arise, but one might also fear unnecessary complications—accusations of overreach by the powerful, entanglements in debt, disputes over corvée labor, and harassment by petty officials—how could one rest easy and uphold lofty principles? This was the generosity of the prevailing customs.

Moreover, Wenzhenggong stood firm in court, upright and unyielding, advancing and retiring with integrity, never currying favor. Had he not served under a supremely sagacious sovereign, how could he have preserved himself to the end and provided for his clan? This was the sagacity of the sovereign’s virtue.

In later times, misfortune befell some families: clansmen vied for precedence, quarreled over right and wrong, or, when opportunity arose, shrank in cowardice and sighed; when calamity struck, they willingly endured humiliation. How could such petty striving compare to the ancients? Here lies the divide between public and private motives, the distinction between worthy and unworthy descendants, the contrast between noble and base customs, and the rise and fall of the age—matters far exceeding the mere relief of hardship.

Sima Dan and his younger brother Guang shared a bond of profound affection. When Dan was nearly eighty, Guang tended to him as to a revered father and cared for him as for an infant. After every meal, he would ask, “Are you not hungry?” At the slightest chill, he would stroke his brother’s back and say, “Is your clothing not too thin?” Later, Guang resided in Luoyang while Dan lived in Xia County. Dan’s estate boasted fine gardens and ponds, and Guang visited once a year to pay his respects; Dan, in turn, traveled to Luoyang to see Guang. Whatever Guang discussed regarding state affairs, Dan would invariably offer his counsel.

When Guang was summoned to the post of *Menxia Shilang*, he firmly declined the appointment. Dan invoked the great principle, saying: “All your life, you have recited the Way of Yao and Shun, aspiring to guide your sovereign. Now, when the time is ripe, to refuse is not the proper course for advancing or retiring.” Guang then reversed his decision and set out. At the time, the realm feared he would never emerge from seclusion, but upon hearing these words, all rejoiced, exclaiming: “These are the words of a true elder!”

The record states: In the hexagram *Tongren*, the second line, central and correct in its position, responds to the ninth line above—does this not describe Guang? The fifth line, strong and central, responds to the second below—does this not describe Dan? Thus, one illuminates the sovereign and delights the realm, while the other, through sincerity and rectitude, upholds the great righteousness of the world. A hundred generations hence, their example remains worthy of contemplation.

Master Cheng Yi’s preface to *The Conduct of Master Mingdao* states:

Endowed with extraordinary nature and nurtured by the Way, the Master was pure as refined gold and warm as fine jade. Broad yet disciplined, harmonious yet unyielding, his loyalty and sincerity pierced metal and stone, while his filial piety and fraternal love reached the spirits. To behold his countenance in meeting others was to feel the warmth of spring’s sun; to hear his words was to receive the nourishment of timely rain. His heart was open and luminous, his insight penetrating without obstruction. To fathom his depths was to gaze upon the boundless vastness of the sea and sky; to exhaust his virtue, even the most eloquent words would fall short of description.

In his own conduct, he governed inwardly with reverence and acted outwardly with forbearance. He regarded goodness as if it originated in himself and refrained from imposing on others what he himself did not desire. Dwelling in the broadest dwelling and walking the great Way, his words carried substance and his actions followed constancy. He discerned the divisions of things and understood human relationships. He knew that to fully realize one’s nature and fulfill destiny must begin with fraternal devotion, and that to fathom the divine and comprehend transformation arises from mastery of ritual and music. He distinguished the heterodox from the seemingly correct, resolved confusions that had persisted for a hundred generations, and attained a depth of principle unmatched since the Qin and Han dynasties.

The record states: The hexagram *Daxu* embodies strength, sincerity, and radiant brilliance. Thus, the supreme virtue of Bo Chun was not mere discourse, nor was the profound scholarship of Zheng Shu excessive praise. Like auspicious clouds on a joyous day, his light illumined all quarters; like gentle winds and sweet rains, his influence nourished the four directions. In establishing virtue and leaving teachings, none could surpass him.

*The Four Ming Gazetteer* records: During the imperial dynasty, the Yang brothers of the Six Ministries—descendants of their father Qi Yun—were Zi Cheng, Zi Nian, and Zi Xi. Zi Cheng, styled Meidu, had a son, Shouchen, who rose to Vice Minister of Personnel, while his grandson Shoulu became Minister of Personnel in Nanjing. Zi Nian, styled Jiansu, had a son, Shousui, who served as Minister of Works. Zi Xi, styled Weian, had a son, Shouyu, who became Right Administration Commissioner of Guangxi, and a grandson, Maoyuan, who served as Vice Minister of Justice, while Maoren became Surveillance Commissioner of Sichuan. All were sons of Wenyi.

Qi Yun mastered the *Book of Changes*, the *Book of Documents*, and the *Book of Songs*, and devoted himself to the learning of Lian, Luo, Guan, and Min. His moral character was steadfast and upright, his practice sincere and unwavering. In his later years, his virtue deepened, and he took the additional name Sicheng.

Wenyi, styled Jingchuan, and his younger brother, styled Bichuan, were filial by nature and treated their brothers with amiable respect, as if they were teachers and friends. From afar, they carried forward the legacy of the Confucian predecessors; up close, they upheld the transmission of their family’s learning. In Siming, since Yang Cihu studied under Xiangshan and Huang Shufa studied under Kaoting, both had distinguished themselves by embodying the unity of substance and function, the integration of the manifest and the subtle—scholars revered them as exemplars. Qi Yun truly inherited their tradition, and Wenyi further expanded it.

In the beginning, they embraced the classical texts to seek the Sage beyond mere words, rejecting mere philology and literary embellishment as true ability. Thus, in self-discipline, family governance, official duties, and interactions with others, they treated the old and young with equal respect, never indulging in the slightest laxity. Their descendants all strictly observed ritual propriety, refusing to yield to unrighteousness, and held the ancients as their unshakable standard.

Wenyi once firmly declined a position in the Ministry of Personnel, saying: “The Ministry of Personnel’s promotions and demotions are the focus of a hundred officials’ grievances. Even someone of Wang Shu’s reputation attracted criticism—how could I, with my inflexible and unsophisticated nature, bear such a responsibility?” He also stated: “A ruler may change, but history must not be erased. Former court historians failed to record the reign of Emperor Jianwen, leaving the reforms of those years and the loyal ministers who served him lost to obscurity. If we compile these records now, we may yet fill the gaps in the national history.” When Emperor Jingtai was restored to the throne, the *Veritable Records* still referred to him as the “Deposed Prince of Langye”—this should be corrected. Furthermore, the old practice of withholding memorials from the emperor should be abolished, and all such documents should be submitted to the Historiography Institute. These were all words of wisdom.

The record states: Song Qianhan’s refusal to serve as chief minister and Yang Jingchuan’s refusal to serve in the Ministry of Personnel—both were Confucian scholars of the Daoist tradition in our Zhe region. Those who restrain themselves and exhaust their own capacities are rarely seen in this age. Thus, they are recorded here.

*Hongdao Record*, Volume Eight, concludes.
*Hongdao Record*, Volume Nine: Benevolence in Friendship.

*The Tongshu* records Master Zhou’s words: “Lofty in the Dao, profound in virtue, boundless in transformative teaching—truly one with Heaven and Earth. Aligning with the four seasons, who but Confucius could this be? The Dao’s loftiness is like Heaven: yang. Virtue’s profundity is like Earth: yin. The boundlessness of transformative teaching is like the four seasons: the Five Phases. Is not Confucius the Supreme Polarity?”

The record states: This is the role of the eternal Teacher of All Ages, sharing the same exalted honor as Yao and Shun. Thus, Zai Wo said, “The Master surpasses Yao and Shun,” and Zigong said, “Since the birth of humankind, none has equaled Confucius.” Yet never before has he been directly likened to the Supreme Polarity. Is there a basis for this? The *Book of Changes* passed through three sages, but it was Confucius who first unveiled the hidden mysteries of the Prior and Posterior Heaven. And it was Master Zhou who unveiled the hidden mysteries of Confucius’ Supreme Polarity.

Thus, before the Supreme Polarity divided, it dwelled in the realm of “not knowing, not perceiving,” yet attained the subtlety of “no sound, no scent.” After it divided, it stood before the formation of form and qi, yet operated within the realm where form and qi exist—truly the pivot of creation, the root of all things. Why is Confucius the Supreme Polarity? Before its activation, the nature of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom resides within, all-encompassing. Once activated, the virtue of centrality, correctness, harmony, and joy responds to stimuli without fail—truly the wellspring of sincerity and the master key of the myriad transformations.

Viewed in its radiant manifestation, Heaven generates the myriad things through yang, and its Dao is manifest. Yet the sage gazes upward, ever higher, delving ever deeper—how could it be exhausted? Viewed in its tranquil profundity and rootedness, Earth completes the myriad things through yin, and its virtue is subtle. Yet the sage’s sincerity runs deep, his benevolence abyssal—where is its limit?

The four seasons proceed: spring, summer, autumn, winter. The four teachings correspond: culture, conduct, loyalty, trust. Their way of nurturing each according to its capacity, assigning each thing to its proper place, is like the Five Phases, each generating according to its nature. Thus, in synthesis, the Master’s person fully embodies the Supreme Polarity, uniting the myriad things as one. In analysis, each thing attains completion through its own way, each possessing its own Supreme Polarity. That he surpasses Yao and Shun lies precisely in his boundless transformative teaching. That none since the birth of humankind has equaled him lies in his lofty and profound virtue. Though their words differ, their principle converges—these three disciples speak as one.

When Yan Yuan asked about benevolence, the Master said, “To master oneself and return to ritual is benevolence.” Elsewhere, he added, “Master oneself and return to ritual, and the world will turn toward benevolence.” Is benevolence to be sought from others, or from oneself? Yan Yuan asked, “May I inquire into its details?” The Master said, “Look not at what is contrary to ritual, listen not to what is contrary to ritual, speak not of what is contrary to ritual, act not in ways contrary to ritual.” Yan Yuan replied, “Though I am not quick-witted, I shall strive to put these words into practice.”

The record states: This is the beginning of the Confucian school’s discourse on benevolence—what is called “penetrating above and below.” That the world turns toward benevolence is the achievement of Yao and Shun. Not a single person fails to find their place, not a single thing lies outside its inherent nature—this is what is meant by “when released, it fills the Six Directions.” To master oneself and return to ritual is the complete work of sages and worthies. Not a single thought fails to align with Heaven, not a single act fails to accord with ritual—this is what is meant by “when gathered, it retreats into profound concealment.” This is the ultimate attainment of the Way of benevolence, the abstruse subtlety of the learning of the heart—known to none but oneself. To know what others cannot, and to do what others cannot—what need is there for anything external? The Master’s instruction to Yan Yuan left no further mysteries.

When those who favor the lofty rush toward the “Four Spirits” and the “Nine Possessions,” and those who cling to the humble remain mired in incompleteness, how wise is Yan Yuan, who asked for its details! For “truly reverent” was Yao, and “truly sincere” was Shun. To master one’s kind begins with seeing, hearing, speaking, and acting. Thus, first clarify the four details, extend the four faculties, and only then can one’s actions serve as the world’s Dao, one’s words as the world’s law, and one’s conduct as the world’s standard. The Master’s answer had its origins here.

Not merely asking about benevolence but earnestly seeking its details, not merely seeking details but putting these words into practice—did Yan Yuan take the role of a supreme sage upon himself? Otherwise, why would he say, “Shun—what sort of person was he? I—what sort of person am I? Let those who would act be like this.”

The Master said, “Hui’s heart does not stray from benevolence for three months. The others may attain it for a month, or even a day.” The record states: I observe the true substance of the Confucian school’s encouragement, the teaching that exhorts all ages to earnestness. Though eighteen hundred years have passed since the sage, we may still measure ourselves against it.

That “three months” does not stray refers not to the minor changes of Heaven’s cycles passing without adherence, nor does “a day or a month” imply progress today and regression tomorrow. Rather, Yan Yuan’s deep immersion and purity allowed him to remain unwavering all day, exhausting his capacity and standing firm—how, after three months of unbroken continuity in the fullness of Heavenly principle, could others match him?

The others may have been nearly as perceptive as Yan Yuan, yet their discernment of goodness was not refined. Their virtue may have matched his in kind, yet their excellence and greatness fell short. Some, in a single day, attained clarity and purity, their Heavenly sagehood shining bright. Others, within a month, strayed but returned, with no regrets. Though they could not yet rest at the center of benevolence, they were not the sort of gentlemen who lacked it. This was the sage’s profound intent, not a slight against those who asked.

The Master said, “How worthy is Hui! With a single basket of rice to eat, a single gourd of water to drink, living in a humble alley—others would find such hardship unbearable, yet Hui never alters his joy. How worthy is Hui!”

Recorded commentary: Here we see how he went three months without straying from benevolence. For coarse food is not a matter of a day or two, nor is a humble alley a temporary circumstance. Others cannot endure such hardship, and so cannot long remain at ease. But Hui—with Heavenly principle shining bright and selfish desires stilled to nothing—felt his heart expand and his body at peace, forgetting his poverty. Seeing the greatness, his mind was at ease and nothing lacked. Thus it is said: he never altered his joy. This aligns with the meaning of the phrase “poor yet rejoicing” in the other passage. Those who study well should consider them together.

The Master said, “Eating coarse food, drinking plain water, resting one’s head on a bent arm—joy lies therein. Wealth and honor gained through unrighteousness are to me like floating clouds.”

Recorded commentary: Here lies the distinction between Confucius and Yan Hui, which those who have not yet grasped the Way fail to understand. The phrase “never alters his joy” may not always hold true. But “joy lies therein” suggests that the Heavenly principle is boundless, without form or limit—yet in truth, the difference is not so great. Confucius said, “Since I had Hui, my disciples have grown ever closer.” Recorded commentary: The phrase “grown ever closer” does not refer to mutual observation and emulation, nor to following in another’s footsteps. Rather, when words are never idle, even casual remarks are not wasted. When nothing fails to bring delight, earnest reminders are not empty words. Seeing his progress without end, how could one not be moved? Returning in joy to reflect in private, one finds ample cause for gladness. This is what is meant by “Is this not also joy?” Such is the art of patient guidance, so thorough that one cannot help but treat the teacher as a father—indeed, one cannot help but do so. How could they not grow ever closer?

When Yan Yuan died, the Master wept bitterly. His followers said, “Master, you grieve excessively.” He replied, “Do I grieve excessively? If not for this man, for whom would I grieve?” Recorded commentary: When Yan Yuan died, Heaven did not cherish the Dao. When the unicorn was captured in the west of Lu, Earth did not cherish its treasure. Both events were enough to move the Master to grief. When Yan Yuan died, the Master said, “Alas! Heaven has bereft me. Heaven has bereft me.” Recorded commentary: The sage’s person was the vessel of the Dao. The Dao does not speak of itself, nor does the person speak of the Dao. Now that the Dao has no transmitter, it is as if I have been bereft. Yet how could the sage abruptly claim that all generations must revere him? “Heaven has bereft me” expresses the utmost love for the Dao. That all generations revere him arises from their true admiration for the Dao. The Dao endures through the ages, and thus the sage does not die. Here we see how weighty Yan Hui’s role was in transmitting the Dao, how vital the bond between teacher and friend in preserving benevolence—this is the ultimate meaning of the Five Constant Relationships.

Master Zeng said, “A scholar cannot but be resolute and steadfast, for his burden is heavy and his path long. Taking benevolence as one’s task—is this not a heavy burden? Enduring until death—is this not a long path?” Recorded commentary: Here we see Master Zeng’s firmness. To take these words as one’s mission is to strive to fulfill them. To take benevolence as one’s task is to hold fast to it—this is the capacity of the highest wisdom. Thus it is said: “Vast and steadfast”—their purpose is one and the same.

Zhong Gong asked about benevolence. The Master said, “When you go out your door, act as if receiving an honored guest. When employing the people, act as if officiating a great sacrifice. What you do not desire, do not impose on others. Let there be no resentment in the state, no resentment in the family.” Zhong Gong said, “Though I am not quick-witted, I ask to take these words as my mission.” Recorded commentary: The Master often praised Yong, saying he was fit to govern. Thus he instructed him in the duties of governance, which are the affairs of a ruler. Even now, reflecting on these words, we can still glimpse Zhong Gong’s demeanor as a model of conduct—how much more those who personally experienced his magnanimous, unhurried, and dignified bearing? Among the disciples of the sage, Yan Hui and Ran Yong were both counted among the virtuous. With such words, understanding comes at first hearing, and the strength to practice them follows. How could one not ask to take them as one’s mission?

Someone said, “Yong is benevolent but not eloquent.” The Master said, “What use is eloquence? Those who overwhelm others with glib speech often incur resentment. Not knowing whether he is benevolent—what use is eloquence?” Recorded commentary: Benevolence is the opposite of glibness. Glibness is a flaw in benevolence. With Yong’s reverence, he maintained self-restraint and extended forbearance to others, leaving no room for resentment. Thus the remark was made. At the time, people knew that benevolence was a fine thing. If one also possessed eloquence, it would be unattainable—this was not a matter of begrudging it. Moreover, the world often mistakes glibness for talent, not realizing its harm. If one of virtue speaks, it is not glibness. Thus the Master repeated, “What use is eloquence?” to thoroughly enlighten the questioner. When he said, “Not knowing whether he is benevolent,” it was like Meng Wubo’s question about Zilu and Ran Qiu—he was not denying their benevolence. Readers should ponder this deeply.

Sima Niu asked about benevolence. The Master said, “The benevolent person is cautious in speech.” “Cautious in speech—can this be called benevolence?” “When practice is difficult, can speech not be cautious?” Recorded commentary: Niu’s repeated question was not without reason. He had seen what Yan Hui and Ran Qiu were taught—earnest and weighty admonitions. Yet what he was told concerned only words and tone. He did not realize that “do not speak what is contrary to ritual” and the steps of self-discipline are the essentials of benevolence. It was not merely about being talkative or hasty, which prompted this response. If one can be careful in speech and not reckless, extending this to what is seen and heard, maintaining vigilance in every thought, then self-discipline and the return to ritual begin here.

Alas, he never heard the words of seeking instruction in affairs, nor grasped the meaning of "difficulty" in practice—merely fretting and fearing, unaware that benevolence arises from oneself. This is why the learning of Yan [Hui] and Ran [Qiu] was so difficult.

When Fan Chi asked about benevolence, the Master said: “In your dwelling, be reverent; in handling affairs, be respectful; in dealing with others, be loyal. Even among the barbarian tribes, these must not be abandoned.”

Recorded commentary: This is most immediately relevant to learners. For one cannot yet receive great guests as if they were present, yet must first conduct oneself with reverence; cannot yet perform grand sacrifices as if bearing them, yet must first handle affairs with respect; cannot yet refrain from imposing one’s desires on others, yet must first deal with others in loyalty. As for the barbarians—this is spoken in profound terms. Fan Chi was coarse and uncouth within the Master’s gate; perhaps he could be exhorted to these virtues, but among barbarians, even this would be impossible. Here the Master deeply admonished his flaws, unlike the saying “no resentment in the state, no resentment in the family.”

When Fan Chi asked about benevolence, the Master said: “The benevolent person first endures hardship and later reaps reward—this may be called benevolence.”

Recorded commentary: I observe that among those in Confucius’ school who repeatedly asked about benevolence, none did so as often as Fan Chi, yet he ultimately failed to transmit the Dao. Why? Because the learning of the sagely gate is pursued for its own sake. One may hear of planning for the Dao without planning for food, but never of requesting instruction in farming—he who plows will hunger. Nor of requesting instruction in gardening—even those who wander within the sagely gate remain thus. Yet Dong Zhongshu of the Han could understand that righteousness is pursued without scheming for profit, and the Dao is illuminated without calculating gain. Can this be regarded as ordinary? Let scholars examine this closely.

When Fan Chi asked about benevolence, the Master said: “Love others.” He asked about wisdom, and the Master said: “Know others.” Fan Chi did not understand. The Master said: “Elevate the upright and place them above the crooked, so that the crooked may be made straight.” Fan Chi withdrew and saw Zixia, saying: “Just now, I saw the Master and asked about wisdom. He said: ‘Elevate the upright and place them above the crooked, so that the crooked may be made straight.’ What does this mean?” Zixia said: “How rich these words are! When Shun ruled the world, he chose from the multitude and elevated Gaoyao—those without benevolence withdrew. When Tang ruled the world, he chose from the multitude and elevated Yi Yin—those without benevolence withdrew.”

Recorded commentary: I observe that Zixia’s words not only elucidated what the Master had left unsaid but also remain irrefutable through the ages. Why must those who rule the world elevate the upright and place them above the crooked? Because right and wrong, good and evil, are ever in opposition. When the wicked advance, the upright become wicked; when the upright advance, the wicked are transformed into uprightness—the critical moment allows no delay. When the Tang dynasty ruled the world, it elevated Wei Zheng, and the customs of the Sui were entirely reformed; when the Song dynasty ruled the world, it elevated Sima Guang, and the policies of Xifeng and Feng suddenly changed. Later, however, the appointment of a single Li Linfu led to the immediate expulsion of the upright, and the appointment of a single Zhang Dun filled the court with petty men. The Master’s words must have lamented the lack of such elevation in Lu. Otherwise, why would he have repeatedly admonished Duke Ai with such urgency? Yet his meaning was vast and profound, concealed rather than revealed, nurtured rather than exhausted. The finest minds within his gate debated and questioned one another, ultimately bringing it to light. Later, [Zi] Shang said “increase,” while Fan Chi remained unenlightened. Thus, the difference between comprehension and incomprehension lies in progress—or the critical moment of advancement or stagnation.

Zigong said: “If one could broadly bestow benefits upon the people and rescue the multitude, how would that be? Could it be called benevolence?” The Master said: “Why stop at benevolence? It would surely be sageliness. Even Yao and Shun would have found this difficult.” The benevolent person, desiring to establish himself, establishes others; desiring to reach understanding, helps others reach understanding. Being able to draw analogies from what is near at hand may be called the method of benevolence.

Recorded commentary: Zigong’s nature approached the highest wisdom, yet he could not fully enter the realm of the sage because he pursued lofty and distant goals. Zengzi’s endowment was limited by his dullness, yet he ultimately transmitted the Dao because he could draw analogies from what was near. Many asked questions at the time. They proposed scenarios and framed their words as if they had gained some insight, yet they did not understand that writings may be broad, but bestowal cannot; love may be widespread, but benevolence cannot. Zigong’s learning had grasped the broad but not the essential, so it was fitting that his approach was diffuse rather than precise. “Desiring to establish” refers to standing firm; “desiring to reach understanding” refers to leaping forward. Both are means of restraining oneself through ritual. If this is taken as a boundary, later generations still speak of “broad love” as benevolence. Yet this is not a failure of the original Dao, but a failure to perceive the Dao through its manifestations. To perceive the Dao through its manifestations is to fail in restraining oneself through ritual. And so it should be.

Zigong asked about practicing benevolence.

The Master said: "A craftsman who wishes to do his work well must first sharpen his tools. When dwelling in a state, serve its worthy ministers and befriend its virtuous scholars."

The Record states: At this time, Zeng [Dian, courtesy name Zigong] had already come to realize that what was right today had been wrong yesterday. Thus he again asked about practicing benevolence—just as one might request instruction in a task. Now, "desiring to establish oneself and establishing others, desiring to reach understanding and enabling others to do so"—this is not something to be done lightly. With worthy ministers above to guide, support, encourage, and exhort, and with virtuous scholars below to influence, nurture, and refine, one will unconsciously stand firm and leap forward. Without such aid, one stands alone. How can one who leads others while isolated and uninformed serve as a model? This is the deep fear I, a humble student, now feel—seeking those to serve and befriend yet finding none.

Meng Wubo asked: "Is Zilu benevolent?"
The Master said: "I do not know."
He asked again.
The Master said: "You [Zilu] could be entrusted with military levies in a state of a thousand chariots, but I do not know whether he is benevolent. What of Qiu [Ran You]?"
The Master said: "Qiu could serve as steward of a city of a thousand households or a noble house of a hundred chariots, but I do not know whether he is benevolent. What of Chi [Gongxi Hua]?"
The Master said: "Chi, girded and standing in court, could engage with guests and envoys, but I do not know whether he is benevolent."

The Record states: Wubo was the son of Yizi and a minister of Lu. His understanding of benevolence had already taken shape—such as the idea that "broad bestowal is difficult." At the time, Zilu, Ran You, and Gongxi Chi served in his household, and observing their bearing and interactions, all showed potential for achievement. Thus he asked about benevolence, knowing that in the Master’s school, benevolence was the foremost virtue. The Master spoke according to reality: one could be entrusted with military levies, stewardship, or diplomatic duties, yet still not be called benevolent. For benevolence is the complete virtue of the original heart, not easily spoken of in the Master’s school. Talent, however, is what the three families needed, and such men were not easily found. Thus the Master neither diminished the three disciples’ true qualities nor lightly affirmed the essence of benevolence. The exchanges of the Sage may indeed serve as a model for all ages.

Zilu said: "I wish to share my carriages, horses, and light furs with friends, wearing them out without regret."

The Record states: Zilu’s worn hempen robe and his carriages, horses, and light furs—was there a difference? No. What he did not feel ashamed of was his resolve to restrain himself. What he felt no regret about was his magnanimous benevolence toward others. One must first hold fast to the resolve not to feel shame, and only then can one place the heart that feels no regret. Thus, strutting through the lanes would be despised by all with understanding, while appearing refined like a pearl in its shell would be something men of resolve would not do—how could this be much for You [Zilu]? This is why he wore them out without regret.

The Master said: "As for sageliness and benevolence, how dare I claim them? Yet in ceaselessly practicing and tirelessly teaching others, one may be said to have attained this much."
Gongxi Hua said: "This is precisely what we disciples cannot learn."

The Record states: Here, the term "benevolence" refers to the undivided whole, the inherent nature of the Dao of Heaven—different from the word-by-word, matter-by-matter exchanges in the Master’s daily teachings. The Master’s refusal to claim it was not mere modesty in response to others’ praise, nor was it simply a humble turn of phrase. "Ceaselessly practicing and tirelessly teaching others" is the pure and unceasing expression of Heaven’s own nature. To hastily claim sageliness and benevolence for oneself would not only confuse learners but also, as long as a single breath remains, allow no slackening in this resolve. Only one who embodies the whole without ceasing can achieve this—how could it be something disciples could learn?

Zizhang asked Confucius about benevolence.
Confucius said: "One who can practice five things in the world may be called benevolent."
He asked what they were.
The Master said: "Reverence, magnanimity, trustworthiness, diligence, and kindness. Reverence avoids insult; magnanimity wins the multitude; trustworthiness gains others’ trust; diligence brings success; kindness enables one to employ others."

The Record states: Zizhang’s question was not like Yuan’s request for specifics. Thus the Master spoke of what he lacked. Reverence is the opposite of arrogance; magnanimity, of cruelty; trustworthiness, of deception; diligence, of indolence; kindness, of harm. Given Zizhang’s tendency to focus on externals and seek lofty heights, he might mistake imposing presence for reverence, lack of resistance for magnanimity, superficial charm for trustworthiness, haste for diligence, and lax commands for kindness—rendering the effects of the five virtues indistinct. This was the profound intent of the Master’s guidance, a fine remedy for his flaws, sharing the same purpose as other passages on the five virtues and four vices.

Master Zeng said: "How imposing is Zizhang! Yet it is difficult to practice benevolence alongside him."
Ziyou said: "My friend Zizhang is capable of what is difficult, yet he has not attained benevolence."

The Record states: The teaching of the Sage’s school took seeking benevolence as its aim, and the learning of the seventy disciples invariably took the Dao of benevolence as its end. Compared with Master Zeng’s "I daily examine myself on three counts" and Ziyou’s "learning the Dao and loving others," their view of Zizhang was as distant as the heavens from the earth. If judged by the standards of later generations’ friendships—where one either flatters or competes—who would admonish another’s faults and prescribe remedies? This shows the true meaning of "using friendship to assist benevolence": neither flattering nor concealing faults, demanding what is difficult, and correcting what is lacking. Such a way is of utmost importance, and such a person is of closest kinship. Thus it concludes.

The *Book of Han* states: Dong Zhongshu, from his youth, was diligent in study and ardent in pursuit of learning. Lowering the curtains to lecture and recite, his disciples transmitted the teachings in order of seniority, and some never even saw his face. For three years, he did not glance at the garden.

Such was his dedication—his every advance and retreat, every gesture and bearing, adhered strictly to ritual propriety. Scholars all revered him as their teacher. During Emperor Jing’s reign, he served as Academician, and later as Chancellor to the King of Jiangdu, who was the Emperor’s elder brother and by nature arrogant and fond of martial prowess. Zhongshu guided him with righteousness, and the King held him in deep respect.

After some time, the King asked: “King Goujian of Yue and his ministers Xie Pu and Fan Li plotted to attack and destroy Wu. I consider these three men of Yue to be paragons of benevolence. What do you think?” Zhongshu replied: “In former times, the Lord of Lu asked Liuxia Hui: ‘I wish to attack Qi. What do you say?’ Liuxia Hui replied: ‘You must not.’ Upon returning home, he wore a troubled expression, saying: ‘I have heard that one does not consult a benevolent man when planning to attack a state. How could such a question have been put to me?’ He was merely asked, and yet he felt shame. How much more should one feel shame for employing deceit to destroy Wu, a state of ten thousand chariots? In this case, there was not a single act of benevolence. The benevolent man rectifies righteousness without scheming for profit, illuminates the Way without calculating gain. Thus, in the school of Confucius, even a child of five feet would feel shame in praising the Five Hegemons, for they placed deceit and force before benevolence and righteousness.”

A later note records: Earlier scholars said that Zhongshu possessed the bearing of a true Confucian. I humbly suggest that he had ascended the hall, though he had not yet entered the inner chamber. Why? Even Fan Chi, a distinguished disciple of the Sage’s school, remained mired in vulgar concerns of near-term advantage. The Master taught him to ‘first endure hardship, then reap reward,’ yet he never fully grasped the lesson. By contrast, in Zhongshu’s three memorials—*The Enlightened Ruler*, *The Two Ministers*, and *The Arrogant Monarch*—he embraced hardship without thought of reward, never displaying the slightest resentment. Compared to Jia Yi, one sees in him no trace of envy or stinginess. This is precisely what it means to ‘rectify righteousness without scheming for profit, illuminate the Way without calculating gain.’ These were not empty words without substance, but the lived reality of his conduct. Even Guan Zhong and Yan Ying would feel shame to be ranked beside him. His lowering of the curtain to lecture and recite brought him close to the joy of ‘daily practice,’ and scholars revered him as their teacher, fulfilling the delight of ‘friends coming from afar.’ Was he not then a gentleman who ‘though others knew him not, felt no resentment’? Though seated beside the apricot altar, he would have felt no shame in keeping pace with the other disciples.

The *Later Han Book* states: Huang Xian was fourteen when Xin Shu encountered him at an inn. Struck by his extraordinary presence, Xin bowed and spoke with him, finding himself unable to leave. He said to Xian: “You are my teacher and model.” Later, when Xin visited Yuan Hong, he asked: “Does your state have a Yan Hui?” Hong replied: “Have you seen our Shu Du?” A man of the same commandery, Dai Liang, was highly talented and haughty, yet in Xian’s presence, he always composed himself with gravity. Upon returning home, he would be lost in thought, as if something were missing. His mother asked: “Have you been with that cow-doctor’s son again?” He replied: “When I do not see Shu Du, I feel myself his inferior.” Observing the man, one found him ever before one’s gaze, yet suddenly behind—so profound as to be unfathomable.

Chen Fan and Zhou Ju often remarked to each other: “In the intervals between our meetings with Huang Sheng, the sprouts of vulgarity and stinginess take root in our hearts.”

When Guo Linzong was young and traveled to Runan, he first visited Yuan Hong but left without staying the night. Proceeding to Xian’s home, he lingered for days before returning. Someone asked Linzong about this. Linzong replied: “Fenggao’s capacity is like a vast overflow—though clear, it is easy to embrace. Shudu’s is boundless as a thousand-acre expanse of waves: unstirred, it does not settle; disturbed, it does not muddy—immeasurable.”

Xian was initially recommended as a Filial and Incorrupt candidate and later summoned to public office. A friend urged him to serve, and though Xian did not refuse, he briefly went to the capital and then returned, ultimately taking no position. The world styled him “The Recluse Summoned.”

*Recorded:* Fan [lacuna] remarked: “Though no record of Huang Xian’s words or manner survives, all gentlemen who met him submitted without exception. He had deeply transcended vulgarity and stinginess, embodying the Dao in its fullness and preserving his nature whole—nothing can be said of him. My great-grandfather, the Venerable Mu, held that Xian’s brilliance lay in his dwelling in perfect harmony with the abyss. His resemblance to the Dao is unfathomable in depth, his distinction of purity and turbidity beyond debate. Were he placed among the disciples of Confucius, he would nearly approach the mark. Among the scholars of the Eastern Capital, I have esteemed none but Xian.”

*Hongdao Lu*, Volume Nine concludes.
*Hongdao Lu*, Volume Ten: Benevolence in Friendship.

Master Zhou Dunyi of Lianxi in the Song awakened to the Dao at a remarkably young age. His character was lofty, his heart as untrammeled as the radiant wind after rain or the moon emerging from clouds, his refined spirit drawn to forests and valleys. Never constrained by others, he was indifferent to fame yet earnest in pursuing his aspirations; sparing in seeking blessings yet generous in winning the people’s hearts; frugal in personal comfort yet lavish in extending kindness to all beings; disdainful of worldly acclaim yet cherishing friendship with the ancients. He once declared: “The scholar aspires to worthiness, the worthy to sageliness, the sage to Heaven. Yi Yin and Yan Yuan were great worthies. Emulate Yi Yin’s aspirations, study what Yanzi studied. Surpass them and you become a sage; match them and you become worthy; fall short and you still preserve an honorable name.”

Noticing the grass before his window left uncut, he was asked why. He replied: “It shares the same intent as my own heart—within my breast, the vitality of life surges boundlessly.” He composed the *Taiji Diagram* and *Penetrating the Book of Changes*, among other works, which profoundly grasped the esoteric teachings left untransmitted for a thousand years, thus continuing the lineage of the Dao from Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Kings Wen and Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius.

Cheng Hao of Henan sent his two sons, Hao and Yi, to study under him. He often instructed them to seek the joy of Confucius and Yanzi, asking: “What is the source of their delight?” The learning of the two Chengs thus originated here. Cheng Hao later remarked: “Since I saw Master Zhou Dunyi returning from gazing at the wind and playing with the moon, I have harbored the same sentiment as ‘I would be like Zeng Dian.’”

Hou Shisheng, who had not yet awakened during his studies with Master Yi of the Yi River, visited Lianxi and stayed for three nights of conversation before returning. Master Yi marveled: “Had he not studied with Zhou Dunyi, how could he have so swiftly absorbed such goodness and enlightened others?”

*Recorded:* The joy of Confucius and Yanzi lay in their dragon-like virtue, centered and upright. The noble person, whose virtue harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, moves with boundless ease, flowing in unison with all things—how could it be measured? Dunyi aspired to this dragon-like virtue, though it remained concealed. The gentleman’s conduct is the cultivation of virtue, as gentle as a balmy breeze, as luminous as the bright moon—how could it be forced or feigned? This was likely Heaven’s gift, bestowed to inaugurate the transmission of the Dao’s learning for ten thousand generations. What he gained from observation and reflection extended beyond merely chanting to the wind and playing with the moon; even strolling among flowers and willows was all part of the same Dao. This is the marvel of the sage’s praise—resonance of like voices, the affinity of like qi—not to be equated with mere words or texts.

Master Cheng Hao of the Mingdao school, even in his youth at fifteen or sixteen, grew weary of the pursuit of imperial examinations and resolved to seek the Dao. Turning inward to the Six Classics, he attained realization on his own, declaring that with Mencius’ passing, the transmission of sagely learning had been lost. He took it upon himself to revive this tradition, aiming to awaken his contemporaries and, in retirement, to illuminate the texts. His life was cut short, yet his words were plain and easily understood, benefiting both the wise and the foolish alike, like a multitude drinking from a river, each according to their capacity.

It is said: The obscurity of the Dao arises from the harm wrought by heterodox teachings. In the past, such harm was near and easily recognized; today, it runs deep and is difficult to discern. In former times, they deceived people by exploiting their confusion; now, they infiltrate by appealing to their loftiness. They claim to fathom the divine and comprehend transformation, yet this is insufficient to disclose things or accomplish tasks. Their words appear all-encompassing, but their deeds neglect human relationships. They probe the profound and the subtle, yet remain inaccessible to the Dao of Yao and Shun. Among the world’s scholars, those who are not shallow, obstinate, or stagnant inevitably fall into this trap.

Since the Dao has been obscured, perverse and monstrous doctrines have arisen in competition, deluding the eyes and ears of the people and drowning the world in filth. Even those of great talent and wisdom, ensnared by what they see and hear, live as if drunk or dreaming, unaware of their own state. These are the overgrowth that chokes the true path and the obstructions that block the gate of the sages. Only by refuting them can one enter the Dao.

It is recorded: Among the disciples of Confucius, Yanzi stood first in the four categories. At the time, he was called "fond of learning." He did not redirect his anger, nor repeat his mistakes. He would not look, listen, speak, or act contrary to ritual propriety. He was as if absent when present, as if empty when full, and though provoked, he did not contend. These virtues were not beyond the reach of Master Cheng Hao (Bochun). Yet observe his end: seated upright like a clay figurine, yet when engaging with others, he radiated a harmonious qi. He never redirected anger or repeated mistakes. His cultivation was so refined that it manifested in his voice and countenance; those who saw him revered his depth and dared not treat him lightly. In handling affairs, he was unhurried and composed, inspiring such sincerity and respect that none dared act carelessly. How could he have spoken or acted recklessly? He preferred to strive toward sageliness without attaining it rather than gain fame for a single virtue. He would rather be troubled by failing to benefit even one being than claim credit for momentary gain. Was this not also to be as if absent or empty?

Among all the Confucians, he alone attained such purity without deviation.

Master Cheng Yi (Yichuan), at the age of eighteen, submitted a memorial to the imperial court, urging the emperor to reject the commonplace discourse of the age and take the kingly Dao as his heart’s intent. While studying at the Imperial Academy, he met Master Hu Yuan (Anding) and asked what learning Yanzi had pursued. Hu replied: "To learn the Dao that leads to sageliness." Cheng Yi asked, "What is the way of learning?" Hu answered: "Heaven and Earth store essence, and those who receive the finest of the Five Phases become human. Their root is truth and stillness. Before emotions arise, the Five Virtues—humaneness, rightness, ritual propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness—are all present. Once form is born, external things touch it and stir the inner self. When stirred, the Seven Emotions—joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, aversion, and desire—emerge. If the emotions blaze unchecked, they erode one’s nature. Thus, the wise restrain their emotions to align with the mean, rectify their minds, and cultivate their natures. The foolish, unaware of restraint, indulge their emotions to the point of ruin.

Therefore, learners must first clarify their minds and understand their natures, then practice diligently to attain humaneness, rightness, loyalty, and trustworthiness, never departing from them even in haste or peril. Over time, they will abide in them with ease. Their movements and demeanor will accord with ritual, and deviant thoughts will have no way to arise." Deeply impressed, Hu Yuan placed Cheng Yi in charge of teaching. Lü Xizhe became his disciple, practicing antiquity with diligence, embracing poverty, and upholding integrity. Cheng Yi read widely, grounding his learning in sincerity. His every action, word, and silence took the sages as his teachers, and he did not cease until he attained sageliness. Thus, he ultimately grasped the learning untransmitted since Confucius and Mencius, becoming a leader among Confucians.

He once said: "For a scholar to pass his years idly without benefiting others is to be a mere parasite in heaven and earth. Only by compiling and studying the sages’ lost writings can one hope to contribute." Thereupon, he composed *Commentaries on the Book of Changes and the Spring and Autumn Annals* to transmit to the world.

It is recorded: What the Han scholars sought was what Confucius and Yanzi delighted in. What Hu Yuan asked was what Yanzi pursued in his learning. Thus, the teaching of masters and the learning of disciples alike took the great sages’ moral nature and destiny as their ultimate aim. This is why the transmission of Dao Learning in the Song dynasty surpassed all previous ages, and why the flourishing of the world and the refinement of customs were so profoundly linked.

Master Zhang Zai (Hengqu) of Guanzhong grounded his learning in fundamental principles, revered antiquity, and practiced with diligence, becoming the leading teacher of scholars in the region. He composed *The Western Inscription*, saying:

"Heaven is called Father, Earth is called Mother. I, so small, dwell harmoniously between them. Thus, what fills Heaven and Earth constitutes my body; what guides Heaven and Earth constitutes my nature. The people are my siblings; all things are my companions. The great ruler is the eldest son of my parents; his high ministers are the stewards of the eldest son’s household. To honor the aged is to extend respect to the elderly; to cherish the orphaned and weak is to nurture the young. Let the sagely embody the union of virtues; let the worthy manifest the finest essence. All in the world who are weary, sick, disabled, orphaned, widowed, or childless—these are my brothers in distress, with none to turn to. At such times, I protect them as a child under my wing. Rejoicing without sorrow, this is pure filial piety. To oppose is to defy virtue; to harm humaneness is to be a thief. Those who aid the wicked are unworthy; only those who fulfill their form are true heirs. To understand transformation is to excel in continuing its work; to fathom the divine is to excel in inheriting its will. To feel no shame in the hidden depths is to be without fault; to preserve the mind and nurture the nature is to be unwavering. To shun fine wine is to follow Boyi’s care for his health; to cultivate talented youth is to emulate the lord of Ying’s bestowal of blessings. To achieve ease without exertion is the accomplishment of Shun; to await cooking without reproach is the reverence of Shensheng. To return to wholeness through what one has received is the way of Zengzi; to bravely follow and obey destiny is the devotion of Boqi."

Wealth, honor, blessings, and grace serve to enrich our lives; poverty, lowliness, sorrow, and distress are but the grinding stone that polishes you to perfection. In life, I follow the course of events; in death, I find peace.

Master Yichuan once remarked: *The Western Inscription* clarifies the principle of unity amidst diversity, expanding upon what the former sages left unsaid. Its achievement equals Mencius’ discourse on the goodness of human nature and the cultivation of *qi*—since Mencius, there has been but one such figure.

It is recorded: The two Cheng brothers possessed innate brilliance and completeness. Upon first meeting Master Lianxi and Master Anding, and hearing of the joy of Confucius and Yan Hui, it was as if they saw with their own eyes and pointed with their own hands—no deliberation, no hesitation. Such was the clarity of their illumination, so seamless and unobstructed.

Master Hengqu’s great elixir bore the fruit of arduous effort, yet lacked the ease of unhurried mastery. His intent and phrasing could not achieve the same seamless flow. Thus, those who read his words may not feel fully enlightened until they reach the end and only then find their doubts dispelled. This is how the two Chengs and Master Zhang diverged.

When we observe how Master Guishan engaged in repeated debates and refutations, and how Master Zhu later expounded upon its intricacies, we see that *The Western Inscription* has flourished to this day. Clearly, their gatherings were not merely to discuss texts with friends but to use friendship to cultivate virtue—here, this becomes all the more evident.

Master Kangjie, Shao Yong, in his youth, was proud of his talents and aspired to establish merit and fame. He was resolute and disciplined, enduring cold without a brazier, heat without a fan, and passing nights without sleep for years. Li Zhicai of Beihai, hearing of his love for learning, said to him: "Have you heard of the study of the nature of things and the principles of life?" Shao then became his disciple, and Li transmitted to him the profound meanings of the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing*, as well as the transmission of the sixty-four hexagrams and their images. Though the origins of this transmission were distant, Shao delved deeply, seeking hidden truths, achieving wondrous insight and spiritual resonance. He penetrated the mysteries, his understanding vast and boundless, gaining much through his own discoveries. As he aged, his learning deepened, and his virtue grew ever more refined. He contemplated the sublime, observing the transformations of heaven and earth, the waxing and waning of yin and yang. From the grand shifts of ancient and modern eras to the subtle natures of birds, beasts, grasses, and trees, he explored every nuance, ultimately expounding the profound teachings of Fuxi’s *Xiantian* (Prior Heaven). He composed over a hundred thousand words.

Fu Bi, Sima Guang, Lü Gongzhu, and other worthies, in their retirement in Luoyang, deeply respected Master Kangjie. They purchased gardens and residences for him, naming his dwelling "Anle Wo" (Nest of Peace and Joy), and thus he was called Master Anle. Sima Guang treated Shao as an elder brother, and the two men’s pure virtue became the admiration of their hometown. They often exhorted one another: "Do no evil, for Sima Duanning is watching." Shao’s wife, Lady Yao, possessed a virtue so pure that her goodness was evident at a glance. Yet she did not flaunt herself, nor did she put on airs. In her presence, all laughed and conversed freely, and though she never acted unusually, when she spoke, she delighted in discussing goodness and concealed others’ faults. If someone sought her counsel, she answered; otherwise, she never forced her words upon anyone. She treated all—regardless of status, age, or rank—with sincerity. Thus, the virtuous rejoiced in her character, while the unvirtuous were transformed by her influence. At that time, Luoyang’s talent flourished, and its atmosphere of loyalty and sincerity spread throughout the realm.

It is recorded: In observing the moral and intellectual accomplishments of the ancients, some achieved them through innate purity, others through the richness of their learning, and still others through the beauty of their environment. Master Shao possessed all three, which is why he stands out as a singular figure across the ages.

Master Guishan, Yang Shi, was by nature open and magnanimous, his attainments profound. From childhood, he was exceptionally gifted, his moral character matured early. What accumulated within him was pure and vast; what manifested outwardly was simple and unadorned. In leisure, he was harmonious and joyful, his demeanor and smile endearing. When handling affairs, he remained composed, never raising his voice.

Those who kept company with him, though gathered in groups all day, would sit in tranquil silence, their presence imbuing others with harmony, while never displaying the slightest hint of disdain or condescension. His magnanimity could embrace all things, its boundlessness imperceptible. Yet he never pursued eccentric or unconventional conduct; his vast reservoir of cultivation remained ever-expanding, never daring to indulge in careless self-expression. Even at eighty, his spirit and vitality showed no decline, surpassing what most youths could muster. In resolving critical dilemmas or managing worldly affairs, his judgment was as clear as a candle’s illumination or a tortoise-shell divination.

Master Yuzhang, Luo Congyan, possessed a nature both luminous and refined, his conduct whole and pure. He enriched himself with breadth and magnanimity, embodying benevolence and forbearance. His insights were profound and subtle, often reaching their utmost depths—unmatched by any Confucian scholars of the Han or Tang dynasties. Without uttering a word, he would suffuse others with harmony; standing beside him, one would be transformed as if by the vernal breeze stirring all things—yet none could fathom how this came to be. Upon hearing of Guishan’s mastery of the Cheng brothers’ teachings, he yearned for it with fervent admiration and set out on foot to study under him, declaring, “Without attaining this, my life would have been lived in vain.” Through deep reflection and steadfast practice, he took the weight of the Way upon himself. After three years of quiet sitting on Luofu Mountain, he plumbed the principles of heaven, earth, and the myriad things, achieving a profound sense of self-possession. He often said, “The ancestral laws and institutions must not be abandoned, nor should one rely complacently on inherited virtue.” He also taught, “When a scholar serves in court, integrity and loyalty must be the foundation. Integrity ensures the court remains free of errors, while loyalty prevents the realm from harboring grievances. To cling solely to integrity without loyalty is to verge on harshness; to lean only on loyalty without integrity is to drift into weakness.” His discourses were always pure and upright, following this pattern.

Master Yanping, Li Gou, was endowed with a resolute and exceptional disposition, his bearing bold and unrestrained. Yet through cultivation, he achieved a state of flawless refinement, his sharp edges smoothed away. His spirit, pure and unadulterated, manifested in his countenance—his expression gentle, his words firm, his demeanor composed, his qi harmonious. Whether speaking or silent, moving or still, he embodied dignity, tranquility, and natural ease, as if guided by an inherent principle. In daily life, he appeared unassuming, indifferent to matters as if they held little consequence. Yet when confronted with critical affairs or sudden crises, he would judge them by principle, displaying an unyielding resolve that brooked no violation. Beyond his lectures and recitations, he would sit in solemn stillness for entire days to verify his insights. He sought the “mean” before joy, anger, sorrow, or pleasure arose, regarding it as the wellspring from which all principles of the world emerged. Once grasping this root, he found that all things branching from it—though myriad in form and endlessly varied—could be encompassed, penetrated, and systematically resolved, each falling into its proper order like the unerring flow of a river’s veins. From the vastness of heaven and earth’s height and depth to the minutiae of living beings’ transformation and nurturance, from the subtle words of classical teachings to the smallest objects of daily use, all could be measured against this standard, none failing to find its proper balance. Through this, his self-cultivation grew ever more steadfast, his nurturing of virtue ever more mature. His spirit became luminous and unified, all things clear to him upon contact, his responses fluid and fitting, his actions always in accord with the mean. Scholars of his time extolled him, saying, “His inner state is like an ice-filled vase beneath autumn moonlight—luminous and flawless, beyond our reach.”

It is recorded: These three masters were the true heirs of the Cheng brothers and Zhu Xi, models for later learners. Their words and bearing stood as exemplary teachings, not only for their own time but for all ages to come. For as long as the innate goodness of the human heart endures, so too will this supreme virtue—worthy of reverent embrace and unwavering adherence.

Master Hui’an, Zhu Xi, from his youth aspired to the learning of the sages and worthies. His father, Weizhai, had received the transmission of classical scholarship from the Central Plains and elucidated the legacy of the sages, focusing his efforts on the cultivation of knowledge and sincerity. Master Zhu, even in his early years, grasped these teachings and held them dear. Yanping, a fellow student of Weizhai, traveled hundreds of li to study under him. Yanping praised him, saying, “His love of goodness and righteousness is unparalleled,” and, “His intelligence surpasses others, his dedication to practice is awe-inspiring.” In his studies, he pursued principle to attain knowledge and turned inward to practice it in action. “Reverence” was the means by which he began and completed his path. He taught that without reverence, the pursuit of knowledge would lead to confusion and distraction, obscuring the true nature of principle. Without reverence, the practice of action would lapse into indolence and self-indulgence, failing to realize principle in reality. The method of maintaining reverence began with “focusing the mind,” sitting in solemn dignity throughout the day, engaging with the classics and canons. From the mind and body of the individual to the myriad affairs and things of the world, all possessed their own principles. He preserved this mind in solemnity, stillness, and unity, while exhaustively investigating these principles through study, inquiry, reflection, and discernment. Yet the knowledge thus cultivated, when manifested in action, was always brought back to the self. The state before perception or hearing demanded ever-greater vigilance and reverence; the hidden and solitary moments required ever-deeper introspection and scrutiny. Before thoughts arose, his awareness remained unclouded; upon encountering things, his responses were precise and unerring. There was no room for the selfishness of human desire, only the fullness of the Heavenly Principle’s rectitude. Herein lay the orthodox transmission of the Dao.

It is recorded: This was the wellspring of Master Zhu’s learning. With Weizhai as his father, his foundation was laid from afar; with Jixi, Baishui, Pingshan, and Yanping as his teachers, his assistance ran deep. As for the three principles—“reverence to establish the foundation, the exhaustive investigation of principle to attain knowledge, and turning inward to practice it in action”—these were the insights Master Zhu made his own, the path he followed from beginning to end without deviation. Such a figure had not been seen since the Qin and Han dynasties, a span of over a thousand years. In his personal cultivation and virtue, he used his singular mind to plumb the origins of creation, fathom the wonders of human nature and emotions, and grasp the profound depths of the sages. Through his singular being, he embodied the Dao of heaven and earth, encompassed the principles of all things, and bore the responsibilities of the fundamental human relationships.

His preservation of the Dao was empty yet sincere; his expression of it was resolute and steadfast. In its application, he responded to affairs and engaged with others with perfect propriety; in its adherence, he remained unchanging through vicissitudes and perils. Through profound cultivation, what was once deep and abstruse became thoroughly refined, and what was once stern and severe grew gentle and harmonious. His mind required no deliberate effort to remain present; his learning needed no further explication to become precise. Yet he still felt the principles of righteousness were boundless while his years were limited, and thus harbored a constant sense of insufficiency.

It is recorded: This was the accomplishment of Master Zhu’s virtue and power. Observing his self-eulogy, he said: *"At ease within the realm of ritual and law, immersed in the treasury of benevolence and righteousness."* Only when these were perfectly aligned did he declare them manifest—perhaps approaching the words of Mencius. Having attained this, he dwelled in it with ease. Dwelling in it with ease, his resources deepened, and drawing from them, he found his source everywhere. How great was the Master! He had reached the ultimate.

It was said that the transmission of the sagely Dao had scattered across texts and records. As the essence of the sages grew obscure, the transmission of the Dao began to fade. Thereupon, he devoted his full energy to exhaustive study, plumbing the classics and teachings of the sages. For the *Great Learning* and the *Doctrine of the Mean*, he filled their gaps, distinguished their sequences, and clarified their guiding principles and details. For the *Analects* and *Mencius*, he delved into the intent behind the questions and answers of their time, so that readers savoring his work might feel as though they stood face-to-face with the sages, receiving their instructions. For the *Book of Changes* and the *Book of Songs*, he sought their original meanings, correcting later distortions to recover the ancient scholars’ intent from millennia past. For the *Book of Documents*, he doubted the coherence of the modern text, finding the ancient version more natural and accessible. For the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, he questioned whether the Sage’s true, magnanimous intent had been distorted by forced interpretations in the commentaries. For the *Rites*, he lamented Wang Anshi’s abolition of the *Ceremonial Rites*, leaving only the *Records* behind. For *Music*, he grieved the loss of pitch standards in later ages, leaving tones without foundation. As for the historical records of successive dynasties, he examined the Western Zhou through the Five Dynasties, selecting chronological works that preserved lineage, and refined them using the *Spring and Autumn Annals’* method of historical narration—comprehensive yet uncluttered, expansive yet not empty.

It is recorded: This was Master Zhu’s merit in continuing the legacy of past sages. Since the Han dynasty, Confucians had engaged in forced interpretations and fragmented speculations, never attaining true insight. Take the *Commentaries on the Changes* and the *Preface to the Songs*—countless schools emerged, while the authoritative annotations of specialized traditions grew vast yet aimless. None could firmly address the subtleties of Heaven’s mandate, the depths of the human mind, or the gateway to virtue, as the present commentaries did. Moreover, every word and meaning was elucidated with clarity and coherence, serving as a compass for scholars across countless generations, enduring as long as heaven and earth.

The works of Zhou, Cheng, Zhang, and Shao had continued the transmission of the Dao from Confucius and Mencius. Yet before long, their profound words and grand principles faded from view. Master Zhu compiled and illuminated them, enabling their flourishing in the world. The *Taiji and Xiantian Diagrams* were profound and boundless, impossible to exhaust. Through his explanations and analyses, the origins of heaven and earth and the hidden depths of the sages were preserved from oblivion.

Master Zhang of Nanjian and Master Lü of Donglai lived in the same era. Sharing the same aspirations and Dao, Master Zhu delighted in their friendship. Even when their views slightly diverged, they would engage in discussion, debate, and refinement to unify their conclusions. Some criticized the rote recitation of commentaries as burdensome, claiming that one could grasp the mind and perceive nature without relying on texts. Scholars, drawn to this simplicity, grew biased and narrow, believing they had attained enlightenment. The more misguided among them even extolled Han and Tang practices, likening them to the Three Dynasties to serve their own utilitarian ends. Master Zhu firmly opposed such trends.

He taught others to begin with the *Great Learning*, the *Analects*, *Mencius*, and the *Doctrine of the Mean* as the proper sequence for entering the Dao, before proceeding to the other classics. Without the *Great Learning* first, one could not grasp the essentials or master the fundamentals. Without studying the subtleties of the *Analects* and *Mencius*, one could not achieve synthesis and thorough understanding, nor fully realize the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s profound aims. Yet without reaching the ultimate in the *Doctrine of the Mean*, how could one establish the great foundation, order the grand principles, read the world’s books, or discuss its affairs? This was likely how Heaven aided the flourishing of culture, sending forth a sage to propagate the great Dao.

After Confucius, Zengzi and Zisi carried on his subtle teachings, until Mencius made them manifest. After Mencius, the Masters Zhou, Cheng, and Zhang revived the interrupted transmission, until Master Zhu made them manifest once more!

It is recorded: This was Master Zhu’s merit in opening the way for future learning. After the Master had synthesized the great achievements of all sages, surpassing even Yao and Shun, Master Zhu synthesized the great achievements of all Confucians—how could his merit be lesser than Mencius’? Scholars of all ages would ponder his words, seek their meaning, and draw lifelong benefit without end, unaware of the depth of his research, the intensity of his reflection, the sleepless nights, or the months of unrelenting effort. How tirelessly he labored! Such was the pinnacle of his great virtue. No matter one’s wisdom or folly, age or rank, wealth or poverty, none could match his earnest devotion.

Master Zhang Shi of Nanjian possessed extraordinary qualities, his intelligence and understanding maturing early. His father, the Loyal and Worthy Duke, taught him the essence of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness. As he grew, he was sent to study under Hu Renzhong. At their first meeting, Hu recognized his great potential and shared with him the profound teachings of Confucius’ discourse on benevolence. Zhang withdrew to reflect, as if gaining insight, and later wrote to seek confirmation.

Master Hu replied, "There are men of the sagely gate—how fortunate for our Dao!" Thus encouraged, Zhang redoubled his efforts, holding himself to the standard of the ancient sages and worthies. He composed the *Record of Aspiring to Yan* as a spur to his own resolve. Though his attainments had already run deep, he dared not rest content, but sought out friends from all quarters to further pursue what he had yet to master. Only after prolonged study, discussion, practice, and personal verification did his former achievements grow ever more refined and profound—until, in the end, he arrived at a realm of simplicity, ease, and unadorned truth.

All the principles under heaven now lay clearly before his mind’s eye, and he truly perceived that which could not be otherwise. Thus his courage in inquiry, vigor in action, and steadfastness in adherence were unshakable. All that he devoted to his lord and kin, all that he unified in Dao and righteousness without ever forgetting his duty to the world—none of this arose from forced effort or mere admiration. In teaching others, he always began by ensuring they first discerned the boundary between righteousness and profit, then clarified the principles and cultivated reverence to reach the utmost. His analyses were incisive and illuminating, his exhortations earnest and compelling, and he would exhaust every angle before ceasing.

He often said, "In learning, nothing comes before the distinction between righteousness and profit. As for righteousness, it is what the original mind must do and cannot refrain from—it is not something one does for the sake of something else. If one acts for the sake of something else, then it is all the selfishness of human desire, and not where the heavenly principle abides." How profound were his words!

This may be called an expansion of what the former sages left "unexpressed," aligning with the work of nurturing the innate goodness of human nature and cultivating qi. The record states: Since the distinction between righteousness and profit became obscured, the harm to the human heart grew acute, its calamities reaching such extremes that barbarians overran the land, hills became ruins, rulers and ministers were bound in captivity, and states were overthrown—not merely confined to the Warring States era. In its final stages, expediency and appeasement were deemed the highest strategy, surrender was seen as wisdom, and people willingly served their enemies, lowering their aspirations and adopting foreign customs—far beyond mere rulers like Guan Zhong or Shang Yang. Yet in those times, within the court and among rulers and ministers, were they all men who had lost their minds or gone mad? Yet Jingfu (Wen Tianxiang) contested this with ever greater resolve, his efforts growing more fervent. Had he not truly perceived the inherent rightness of heavenly principle, free from the falsity of human desire, how could he have advanced so fearlessly, heedless of consequences? In this, his discernment of righteousness and profit was not merely theoretical but embodied and rigorously examined—far from empty words meant to deceive the world.

Master Zhen Xishan (Zhen Dexiu), when the prohibition on learning grew ever stricter, took it upon himself to uphold this cultural legacy, lecturing on it and putting it into practice. He compiled the *Reading Notes*, placing the study of nature and destiny at the forefront as the source of moral principles. The nature’s expression is emotion, while the mind governs both nature and emotion—these three form the framework of the work. Its sections address the virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust as the heavenly-endowed nature; the relationships of father and son, ruler and minister, husband and wife, elder and younger, and friends as the Way of following one’s nature. What all people traverse is called the Way; what one attains within oneself is called virtue—yet in reality, they are not two. Thus, he followed with "the Mean," "the One," "the Ultimate," and "sincerity," all being the Way, though named differently. He then asked: Where should scholars seeking the Way begin? Reverence is the root of learning, so he placed it first, followed by the Way of the teacher, methods of instruction, and the sage. Distinguishing between the gentleman and the petty man, and between the true Way and heterodoxies, pertains to the *Great Learning*, so he addressed these next. The principles of yin-yang and creation were briefly introduced in the section on nature and destiny, with further details concluding the work.

His *Extended Meanings* (*Daxue Yanyi*) argued that a ruler ignorant of the *Great Learning* could not purify the source of governance, nor could a minister ignorant of it fulfill the duties of ruler and minister. The principles expounded in this work are truly the essential canon for transmitting the mind across generations, not merely the private teachings of Confucius. Recent great scholars have composed commentaries and dialogues to elucidate its meaning, and I humbly sought to provide supplementary support. This work is rooted in the learning of sages and worthies to illuminate the governance of emperors and kings. Drawing from the near past to prepare for future affairs, it is resolutely presented as the laws, statutes, and models for ruling all under heaven. Thus, it takes clarifying the Dao and discerning talent as the essence of "investigating things and extending knowledge"; reverence, awe, caution, and restraining desire as the essence of "making thoughts sincere and rectifying the mind"; prudence in speech and conduct, and proper demeanor as the essence of "cultivating the self"; valuing marriage, strict inner governance, securing the state’s foundation, and educating relatives as the essence of "regulating the family." When the Way of these four is attained, governing the state and bringing peace to the world are encompassed within.

The record states: Observing the principles of these two works, I privately drew parallels in compiling this record. Citing the words and deeds of former sages, worthies, and contemporary authors, I followed the model of the *Extended Meanings*, adding my own insights without rigidly adhering to exegetical conventions—this too reflects my humble intent. In an age when the Dao’s learning was widely proclaimed, recited in every household, would clinging to old conventions be preferable to no record at all? Yet principles are infinite, and the human heart is responsive; myriad transformations arise from them. To fixate on exegetical details is to limit one’s own progress. Confucius said, "It is people who enlarge the Way, not the Way that enlarges people." How dare later generations not strive to emulate and reach it? Seeking correction from those of the Dao, I privately echo the three sighs of Master Zhen Wengong.

Master Heshān (Wei Liaoweng) displayed extraordinary intelligence from youth, earning the title of "divine child." At a time when discussing the learning of the Dao was taboo, after passing the imperial examinations, he encountered the successive administrations of Han Tuozhou and Shi Miyuan. He firmly declined official appointments, built a retreat on White Crane Mountain, and opened his doors to teach disciples, transmitting what he had learned from Li Fan of Fuliang. Thus, the people of Shu came to fully understand the learning of moral principles. In his studies, he illuminated moral principles through things and sought benevolence by reflecting on the self. He examined the minutiae of elementary learning and ritual arts to deduce the grandeur of ritual integration; he grounded himself in the subtleties of daily life to extend his understanding to the manifest workings of heaven, earth, and spirits. He held that the books of sages and worthies, passed down through recitation and transmission since the Han, have endured to the present. Though the transmission between masters and disciples often missed the essentials, the ancient institutions and the words of former sages remain within them—elements that cannot be discarded. Since the teachings of the Lian-Luo school spread, Master Zhu (Xi) inherited and elucidated them, and scholars turned toward the root of morality and destiny, gaining clarity. Yet those who pursued this path recited its phrases tirelessly, while the work of broad learning and extensive knowledge seemed neglected. Moreover, the ills of recent times incline toward recklessness: those who seek this learning may not apply it deeply to their own minds and bodies, while those who extend it elsewhere often lack thoroughness and breadth. Thus, the errors and distortions in transmitted commentaries remain unclarified, and the surviving details of names, objects, and measurements are not examined at their source. If one truly seeks to contribute to the world, how can they grasp the intent behind the sages’ creations or serve as instruments for reform and adaptation?

The Master, deeply concerned, thus devoted careful attention to the records of the *Yili*, the *Zhouguan* and its greater and lesser codes, and selected the finest exegeses and correct interpretations from the Nine Classics. Arranging them by matter and category, he compiled them into the *Essential Meanings of the Nine Classics*. His aim was to demonstrate the inseparability of Dao and its vessels, and to rectify the confusions of arbitrary theories and contentious debates that mislead the world. This aligns precisely with Master Zhang’s teaching through ritual and Master Cheng’s principle of thoroughness from beginning to end.

The compiler notes: Observing Heshan’s critiques, I sigh for today’s scholars—matters too distressing to speak of. They pursue mere verbal mastery, neglecting the transmitted commentaries; they seek the shortcuts of official advancement, disregarding the names and objects of the classics. They recognize their errors yet do not know where to halt before reaching ruin. Previously, there were still those who earnestly engaged in learning, though their contemporaries gathered to oppose them. Now, their voices have faded into silence, and none find it strange, merely dismissing them as shallow and base. Yet the corruption they wrought upon the people’s minds and the harm to the Way of governance are far from trivial. Who among us feels the alarm and dread that Master Wei did? This is why this compilation persists tirelessly.

During the Yuan dynasty, Master Xu Heng of Luzhai, steadfast by nature, acquired the learning of the He-Luo school from his teacher Yao Shu of Xuezhai. Wherever he taught, his influence flourished, and his reputation for great virtue resounded across the north and south. When the First Emperor of the Yuan first heard of the Way of emperors and kings, it was Master Xu who enlightened him, preserving the Confucian Dao from decline. Thus, the Emperor did not惜名爵 to summon scholars from all corners, and though Xu firmly declined the post of chief minister, he oversaw education as the head of the Imperial Academy. Beginning with elementary learning, he advanced through the Four Books, then to the *Yijing*, *Shijing*, *Shujing*, and *Chunqiu*, instructing his disciples directly, always grounding them in filial piety, brotherly respect, loyalty, and trust. The people were transformed by his teachings—fathers instructed their sons, elder brothers exhorted their younger brothers. Not only did he tailor instruction to each student’s abilities, but he also guided them progressively according to their capacities, clarifying their insights while dispelling their obstructions, nurturing their goodness. He timed his teachings to their activities and rest, guarded against nascent faults, and fortified their defenses. Day by day, month by month, they were transformed without realizing it. Thus, all who entered his gate were bound to him as father and son, and each became capable of serving the world.

He also said: In learning, managing one’s livelihood comes first. If basic needs are unmet, one’s pursuit of learning will be hindered, leading to reckless pursuits or misguided advancement. Even those who become officials and crave profit often do so out of financial hardship. Scholars and gentlemen should prioritize agriculture, though commerce, though a lesser pursuit, is not without merit. If conducted without violating principles of righteousness, it may serve as a temporary expedient. But to rely on teaching or official positions to secure one’s livelihood is not the intent of the ancients.

The compiler notes: Some have compared Zhongping to Ziyun and Jiefu, but how could this be so? The times and circumstances of those two were unlike his. In Ziyun’s era, the realm had no rival sun, and Wang Mang’s hidden motives were discernible. Thus, those like Feng Meng and Qiao Xuan could withdraw—this was acceptable. In the reign of Emperor Shenzong, the people acknowledged no second king, and Wang Anshi’s private ambitions were evident. To speak then of "inner refinement and outer barbarism" was indeed severe. But Xu Heng lived in an age of divided realms, witnessing treacherous officials misleading the state—a time when, as the saying goes, "the Yi and Autumn lack rulers, unlike the Xia without one." Could one demand of him that he defy the principles of the *Chunqiu* and tread the path of the tyrannical Qin? Observe his conduct since the founding of the Yuan: summoned ten times, he never compromised an inch for a foot, resolutely declining the post of chief minister to serve in the Imperial Academy. He never engaged in reckless discussions of usurping kings or deceitful Xia, but tirelessly devoted himself to the good of others. His heart is thus discernible. If Xu Heng’s life was one of misfortune, it was not because he took risks for personal gain.

During the present dynasty, Master Xue Xuan, the Duke of Wenqing, from youth studied and clarified the learning of Zhou, Cheng, Zhang, and Zhu, declaring: "This is the true lineage of the Dao." He devoted himself to it wholeheartedly, even forgetting to eat. As he matured, his character became upright and unyielding; in his conduct and interactions, he never wavered or compromised. He often said: "In reading and investigating principles, one must truly grasp them, then verify them in one’s own mind and body, embodying and practicing them. Otherwise, it is like buying a chest and returning the pearl." He earnestly taught the restoration of one’s nature, saying: "This is the crucial point of Cheng and Zhu’s teachings for humanity. The Six Classics and Four Books are all encompassed in the single word *nature*. After Mencius, the Dao did not flourish because *nature* remained obscure." Thus, his learning was a direct transmission from the hearts of Lian and Luo, a spiritual communion with Mo and Si. From the one mind and one body, he extended it to all affairs and all things, then distilled it back to unity. Often, he would close his eyes and sit in meditation, pondering until he attained insight, his joy manifesting on his face. He had reached the realm of delighting in the Dao. As for the joy of wind and crane, the songs of kite and fish—these were his private realizations, visible to all who looked. Truly, he could have joined Zeng Dian in playing music and roaming freely.

In matters of giving and receiving, entering or leaving office, or the duration of service, his conduct was luminous and upright. After Luzhai, none have matched him. His spirit was free and unburdened, untroubled by worldly concerns. Even Liu Jingxiu’s soaring phoenix, with its lofty aspirations, could not surpass him.

The compiler notes: Among the Confucian scholars of the present dynasty, after Wang Huangu, Zhao Kaogu, Song Qianxi, and Fang Zhengxue, came Xue Wenqing, Wu Kangzhai, Yang Wenyi, and Qiu Wenzhuang. By the Chenghua era, a flourishing generation emerged—Luo Yifeng, Zhang Fengshan, Huang Weixuan, Zhuang Dingshan, He Yixian, Hu Jingqi, Zou Lizhai, Chen Baisha, Chen Buyi, Zhou Cuiqu, and Zhang Shubai. Truly, it was a time of great prosperity.

Yet none of these figures revealed the wellspring from which their learning flowed, nor the lineage to which the Dao’s transmission belonged. Even in their passing, the direction of their teachings and the branching of their legacies remained unseen. Consider the likes of Zhou, Cheng, Zhang, Zhu, He, Wang, Jin, and Xu—when the great learning of the Dao shone forth, scholars divided themselves between Zhu and Lu, or aligned with the schools of You and Yang. Yet was this not merely a matter of those whose natural endowments approximated the Way claiming merit, rather than a transmission of the Dao’s essence through silent resonance with a master?

Now, observing Jingxuan’s steadfast devotion to the recovery of human nature as the essential task—extending from the singular heart and body to the myriad affairs and things, then contracting all back to the One—we may say he grasped the root of the sagely learning. Thus, this record is made so that those with aspiration may follow this path to enter the Way. Not only will the undertakings of Cheng and Zhu become readily apparent, but the transmission of Confucius and Yan Hui will also be found to lie nowhere beyond this.

**Righteousness: The Righteousness of Ruler and Minister**

Yao said: *"Ah, you Shun! The celestial mandate now rests upon you. Hold faithfully to the Mean. If the Four Seas fall into hardship and poverty, the Heaven-bestowed emolument will end forever."*

The compiler notes: The character *"Mean"* was first uttered by Yao, marking the wellspring of the Dao’s transmission. For the righteousness between ruler and minister is not merely a matter of hierarchical order, each occupying their proper station. That which Heaven cannot purify, Earth cannot settle, spirits cannot verify, and sun and moon cannot illuminate—none of these exist apart from this principle. Thus, the hexagrams embody the Way of the Three Powers, pairing with Heaven and Earth, penetrating and unifying all, filling and suffusing the space between. Yet this is not the product of private cleverness or forced interpretation.

From the recognition that human nature is fundamentally good arises the principle of impartiality—neither leaning nor overreaching, without excess or deficiency—a decree of Heaven itself. The ultimate refinement of this subtlety can only be faithfully upheld by the utmost sage, just as Heaven revolves above, and the celestial mandate operates without exception. Without this, how could one engage with the vastness of Heaven and Earth or the multitudes of the people? How could one ensure the Four Seas do not fall into hardship or the Heaven-bestowed emolument endure forever? Herein lies the guiding thread, the establishment of the celestial standard, and the opening of the primordial righteousness between ruler and minister for all ages.

Shun commanded Yu, saying: *"The human heart is perilous; the heart of the Dao is subtle. Be discerning and unified, and hold faithfully to the Mean."*

The compiler notes: This principle of the *"Mean"* grows ever more precise without confusion when refined, ever deeper without exhaustion when explored, ever more intimate without strain when sought, and ever more concise without complexity when examined. With Yao’s single utterance, it was complete. Yet Shun further elaborated with three additional phrases—not to add to it, but because without reverence, clarity, cultured thought, and profound wisdom, the principles of Heaven and human desires risk blending into one path. The difference between them may seem as slight as a hair’s breadth, yet the divergence of a hair’s breadth leads to an error of a thousand miles. This is the crux of the sage’s concern for the Dao and the urgency of his effort—something later enlightened rulers and worthy ministers must carefully consider.

Yu’s *Counsels* state: *"Let the ruler be diligent in his role as ruler, and the minister in his role as minister."*

The compiler notes: This first counsel of Yu’s is deeply personal and resonant, for both Shun and Yu embodied it. Shun rose from humble origins to be summoned for service, tested through trials, and entrusted with regency before ascending to the throne. His governance—whether aligning the Seven Governors, overseeing the Hundred Administrators, appointing the Nine Ministers, or punishing the Four Felons—was never taken lightly. Yu’s labors were even more arduous: his toils in water and land control pained him more than a father’s neglect, his calloused hands and feet were earned without a son’s aid, eight years of toil left him without a home, and his fourfold suffering exceeded what he endured for himself. Had he approached these tasks with ease, how could he have avoided repeating past failures?

Thus, he detested indulgence in fine wine, mastered his desires; cherished every moment, mastered time; regulated his voice and bearing, mastered himself; adhered to the plumb line and carpenter’s square, mastered governance; rose ten times for a single mirror, mastered diligence; and grasped his hair thrice during a single bath, mastered caution. From exhausting his mind and scorching his thoughts to the point of *"I have no leisure"*—what was not a difficult task? Alas! Difficulty brings order; ease brings chaos. Difficulty brings stability; ease brings peril. Elsewhere, the Master urgently declared: *"A single word can build a state; a single word can ruin it."* Oh, how can one not be vigilant?

Gaoyao said: *"Do not indulge in ease or desire when governing a state. Be vigilant and diligent, attending to the myriad affairs day after day. Do not neglect any office, for Heaven’s work is carried out by human hands."*

The compiler notes: Gaoyao’s intent was to emphasize that the more diligent one is, the more meticulous one must be. The failure to be diligent lies in the heart, yet the means to fulfill this lie in the myriad affairs. Consider Heaven: in a single day and night, it completes a cycle of 365 degrees and a quarter. Within this, the revolutions of the sun and moon, the movements of the stars, the interplay of yin and yang, and the convergence and dispersion of the Five Phases—are these not a myriadfold? So too with the ruler: between one day and the next, from sweeping the floor to commanding chariots and armies, from managing court ministers to overseeing distant barbarians, the order or chaos of the court, the weal or woe of the people, the security or peril of the altars of soil and grain, and the rise or decline of the realm—are these not a myriadfold in their diversity? Yet all hinge upon a single thought.

The subtlest stirrings of the heart, when inclined toward goodness, ensure that nothing is not good, and the myriad threads are all ordered. When inclined toward evil, nothing remains good, and all affairs go awry. Thus, one must guard it with vigilance and uphold it with care, attending to the slightest signs. In oneself, there must be no trace of selfishness, no deviation by a hair’s breadth. Though the world may be tangled and chaotic, with ten thousand things unequal, all can be threaded through the One without omission. This is the meaning of *"Heaven’s work carried out by human hands"*—unifying inner and outer as one.

Yi and Ji said: "A minister indeed! A neighbor indeed! A neighbor indeed! A minister indeed!"

The Record states: Where there is Heaven, there is Earth—Earth clings to Heaven. Where there is a ruler, there is a minister—a minister depends upon the ruler. Heaven is but a single qi, yet through it the manifestations of life and the profusion of things arise. Heaven encompasses the towering, the flying, the hidden, the looming and bearing, the stirring and flowing—vast in breadth, boundless in depth, reaching everywhere—all the work of Earth. The ruler is but one man, yet through him the court is rightly ordered and the myriad states are rectified. In employing men and enacting governance, in pacifying the high and governing the people, from the Three Luminaries above to the multitudes of living beings below, from the Four Barbarians without to the Eight Wastes afar, none is not fittingly served—all the work of ministers. This principle of ruler and minister advances nothing beyond the relationship of Heaven and Earth, yet the counsels of the Yu court first proclaimed the meaning of *"A minister indeed! A neighbor indeed!"*—reiterating and expounding its import with profound reflection, a truth those above should immerse themselves in and never lose.

The Emperor said: "Ministers serve as my limbs, ears, and eyes. When I desire to aid and sustain the people, you are my wings. When I desire to extend my strength to the four quarters, you act. When I desire to behold the forms of the ancients—the sun, moon, and stars; mountains, dragons, and flowering vines; sacrificial vessels and ancestral wine jars; waterweeds, fire, grain, and the axe-emblems—adorned with the five colors upon the five hues to make the robes, you make them clear. When I desire to hear the six pitch-pipes, the five notes, the eight timbres, in governance or neglect, to receive and issue the five words, you listen."

The Record states: Only after the principle of limbs, ears, and eyes is made manifest does the head and heart grow ever more endearing. This is not merely the natural order of reason, but the inevitable course of circumstance.

Should the hands and feet grow numb and withered, we call it "lacking humaneness"; if the ears and eyes fail in clarity, one ceases to be fully human. Can any part of the body be spared? Only when the body commands the arm, the arm commands the fingers, when outward grace resides in ears and eyes and inward substance in keen perception—only then can one bear the heavens and tread the earth as a true human being. Without these, one sees nothing, takes no step forward.

So too with the ruler. Only with limbs does he gain wings; only with limbs does he possess ears and eyes; only then can he see clearly, hear keenly, and fulfill the functions of his entire being. Thus governing the world becomes as effortless as turning his palm. Yet this principle lies in the ruler’s own cultivation of virtue. As the *Poetry* says: "If your virtue shines not, none will stand at your back or side; if your virtue shines not, none will serve as your ministers or lords."

Alas! Let him take heed! If I stray, you must correct me; do not feign compliance to my face, then murmur dissent in private—reverence your four neighbors.

The Record states: Is feigned compliance ever a minister’s rightful choice? Even if the executioner’s blade and the tiger’s trap lie before and behind, it may yet be excusable. Yet how swiftly loyalty is severed in the span of a brief exchange, how readily one flatters the ruler with a glance or gesture—knowing only to echo his words without daring dissent, heedless of reason’s right or wrong, of affairs’ success or failure. Alas, to what depths this descends!

And what ruler delights in private murmurs? Even if one shifts with others’ influence or adapts to circumstances, it may yet be excusable. Yet how quickly private bonds are forged, how readily grievances are pointed out in court debates—worse still, how one gathers scraps of the past to prove one’s own twisted arguments. Alas, to what depths this descends!

This arises because the ruler fails to honor the principle of correction, because the minister neglects the duty of loyal counsel, because between ruler and subject there is only biased listening and solitary trust. Do they not know the court belongs to all the people, the world to all under heaven? How can the inclinations of one man determine the right and wrong of ten thousand affairs?

The Record further states: Alas! Let this be a warning.

Let there be no negligence in vigilance, no deviation from the law and standards, no indulgence in idleness, no excess in pleasure. Appoint the worthy without hesitation, remove the wicked without doubt. Do not finalize plans when uncertain, and let all aspirations flourish in harmony. Do not violate the Dao to curry favor with the people, nor deceive the people to satisfy one’s own desires. Remain neither idle nor negligent, and the four barbarians will come to submit.

The Record states: You must not merely obey in person while harboring dissent in private. In the grand court, before the assembled officials, one must strike at the dragon’s reversed scales and challenge taboos—this is how to suppress human desires at their inception and preserve Heaven’s principles before they fade. Beware! Those who guard against negligence, who stand beneath the vast roof, who tread the fine path, with a wise ruler before them and admonishing ministers behind, thus bring order before chaos arises and secure the state before peril emerges. That the four barbarians come to submit is not due to strong armor or sharp weapons, but to appointing the worthy, removing the wicked, and uniting minds in singular purpose. The intent of the *Yi* is thus revealed. That the Miao tribes came to submit and moved Heaven’s heart—was this mere coincidence? Mencius said: "Tang held to the center and established the worthy without fixed criteria."

The Record states: Yao, Shun, and Yu merely spoke of holding to the center, not of establishing the worthy. For in the time of Yao and Shun, there were the Eight Yuan and Eight Kai, the Nine Ministers and Twelve Governors, all flourishing in mutual deference, filling the court. In Tang’s time, he sought the most sagely, yet Yi Yin went five times to Tang and five times to Jie. Had Tang not sent envoys thrice to invite him, how could he have risen so readily? This is why yielding the throne to another differs from preserving a state on the brink of collapse. Yet in both cases, attaining sageliness through holding to the center and refining unity follows the same path.

The *Tang Gao* says: "We sought the most sagely and joined with him in effort." It also says: "Yearning for one of singular virtue, we made him the divine sovereign." The Record states: This shows the weight of aligning with the Dao, and Tang’s own commitment cannot be denied. He did not merely speak of "sageliness" but of "the most sagely"; not merely of "virtue" but of "singular virtue." For he established the heart of Heaven and Earth, the mandate of the people, preceding Heaven yet not defying it, following Heaven yet adhering to its timing. Thus it is said: "Joined with him in effort, we made him the divine sovereign." How unlike later ages, where rulers favor ministers who merely follow their teachings rather than those who truly guide them. Such teachings, confined to the ruler’s path, remain trivial and base. No wonder they claim sageliness for themselves.

Wan Zhang asked: "Is it true that Yi Yin sought Tang’s favor through cooking?" Mencius replied: "Yi Yin plowed in the wilds of Youxin, delighting in the Dao of Yao and Shun. If it were not righteous, if it were not the Dao, even offering him the world as salary, he would not glance at it. Even if given a thousand teams of four horses, he would not look. If it were not righteous, if it were not the Dao, he would not give or take even the smallest thing. When Tang sent messengers with gifts to invite him, Yi Yin calmly said: 'Why should I care for Tang’s gifts? How could I compare to remaining here in the fields, delighting in the Dao of Yao and Shun?' After Tang sent envoys three times, Yi Yin suddenly changed his mind, saying: 'Rather than remain in the fields delighting in the Dao of Yao and Shun, how much better to make this ruler a ruler like Yao and Shun, to make these people a people like those of Yao and Shun, to witness this with my own eyes! Heaven gave birth to these people so that those who know first awaken those who know later, so that those who awaken first awaken those who awaken later. I am one of Heaven’s people who awakens first; I will use this Dao to awaken these people. If not I, then who?' He thought of the people of the world—every man and woman who had not received the blessings of Yao and Shun—as if he himself had pushed them into the ditch. Such was his sense of responsibility for the world’s weight. Thus he went to Tang and persuaded him to attack Xia and save the people."

The Record states: When the Four Mountains recommended Shun, Yao still tested him through hardships, for Yao had no choice. Within the family, it was difficult, while the world was easy; family was close, while the world was distant—could Shun truly be entrusted with the throne? "I have tested him thus." When Tang sent three envoys to invite Yi Yin, who still scorned and boasted of his contentment, it was not that Yi Yin was disrespectful. For a ruler with great ambitions must have ministers he cannot summon. If he does not honor virtue and delight in the Dao to this extent, he is unworthy of great deeds. This threefold invitation was truly the noble conduct of a ruler, the grand virtue of an emperor. Yet even so, some mocked Yi Yin for seeking favor through cooking—how can one not be cautious in matters of entering or withdrawing from office?

It is also said: Why did Yi Yin delight in the Dao of Yao and Shun? The Dao of Yao and Shun is inherently present in one’s nature—how could it exist in me but not in others? People only fail to value themselves, fretting over poverty and low status. Poverty and low status—what are mere rice and wild herbs? They chase after wealth and nobility, yet wealth and nobility—what are mere wooden deer and swine? Thus, nothing is greater than refining unity and holding to the center, and without righteousness and the Dao, how can one refine anything? Nothing is more difficult than possessing the world yet not claiming it, and without even the smallest thing or a thousand teams of horses, how can one hold fast? Nothing is more urgent than preserving the heart for the world, where the first to know awaken those who know later, the first to awaken awaken those who awaken later—how intimate is this vision! Nothing comes before dedicating oneself to the poor, where every man and woman of the world is entrusted to one’s care—how pressing is this duty! Was this mere empty talk or pretense to deceive the world and steal fame?

Later, Master Meng nearly embodied this. He said: "Whether people know me or not, I remain content," reflecting the same heart as Yi Yin’s three refusals of the invitation. He said: "In poverty, I do not lose righteousness; in success, I do not depart from the Dao," reflecting the same heart as Yi Yin’s disregard for the world. He said: "Standing at the center of the world, I stabilize the people of the four seas," reflecting the same heart as Yi Yin’s "If not I, then who?"

He said: "When one’s aspirations are realized, grace extends to the people; when one attains success, one brings goodness to all under heaven"—this reflects the same heart of shouldering heavy responsibility. Yet why, in the Warring States, did the Three Dynasties’ way not return? Why, under Kings Hui and Xuan, did the virtue of Tang not reappear? We see only three nights’ hesitation before leaving the capital, but never three summonses crossing the border—how lamentable!

*The Counsels of Gao Yao* states: "Morning and evening, receive instruction to aid my virtue. Like metal, I will use you as a whetstone; like crossing a great river, I will use you as a boat and oars; like a year of great drought, I will use you as timely rain." The *Record* explains: "A whetstone is a stone from another mountain, able to polish jade; a boat is for traversing peril, overcoming difficulty, and safely crossing great rivers; timely rain is when remonstrance is heeded and words are followed, so that nourishing grace flows down to the people." These three are the Way of the minister.

Yet there are those who, like metal, bring about change and reform; those who, like cinnabar, drown together; and those who, like drought, share in the burning. Thus, if a ruler obtains the right minister, what matter cannot be accomplished? But if he fails to obtain the right minister, then not only will his illness darken his sight until it festers—my concern!—but he may also wound his own feet until he walks barefoot—my fear! This is the profound meaning of the *Record*.

Gao Yao further said to the king: "Only when wood follows the marking line does it become straight; only when a ruler heeds remonstrance does he become sagely." The *Record* states: "Wood following the line is the perfection of compass and square; a ruler heeding remonstrance is the perfection of human relations for a sage." The rulers of the Three Dynasties who maintained their legacy bore this burden without losing their thread, relying entirely on this principle. Emperor Taizong of Tang once used it to instruct his heir—he was nearly one with whom such words could be shared.

It is also said: "If the heart of the wood is not straight, all its veins and patterns become crooked." Alas! Is this wood not entirely different from wood that follows the line?

Confucius said: "Though he possessed two-thirds of the world, King Wen served the Yin with the virtue of Zhou—this may be called the ultimate virtue." The *Record* states: Confucius’s praise of King Wen arose from his understanding of the *Book of Changes*. *Qian* represents heaven, the ruler, the superior, the crown, the head; *Kun* represents earth, the minister, the inferior, the shoe, the foot. That a minister cannot be placed above the ruler is like earth not being placed above heaven, the inferior not above the superior, shoes not above the crown, or feet not above the head—all are the meanings of the sage’s commentary on the *Changes*. Though it is said: "Heaven grants it, the people return to it; I would rather preserve my inner brilliance, I would rather tread upon frost"—this is the magnanimity of his heart, the grandeur of his self-conduct, the steadfast compliance in governing things, and the boundless nature of his virtue and fortune. What limit could there be? What measure could contain it? Thus, it is not merely called "virtue" but "ultimate virtue."

The *Records of the Historian* state that King Wen secretly practiced goodness, so he needed no trial to exonerate himself. When King Wu campaigned against Zhou, Boyi and Shuqi grasped his horse’s bridle to remonstrate. The attendants wished to strike them, but the Grand Duke said: "These are righteous men." He helped them away.

The *Record* states: Observing Boyi and Shuqi’s integrity, even today it remains awe-inspiring, as if alive. Yet in the end, they could not stop the campaign against Zhou. Were the words of these righteous men truly of no use? No. The reason the principles of heaven endure and the human heart does not perish is that a single word from a person stands between heaven and earth. If the Zhou were to rise, if they were to defeat the Yin, if they were to assemble without expectation, if "God is watching over you"—yet the principle of heaven’s supremacy and earth’s humility is real. If no one speaks of it, will not the hexagram *Qian* nearly cease? Will not the ruler’s role nearly vanish? Thus, they had no choice but to contend. Their contention was not to prevent the fall of Yin—it was to preserve the heart of Yin; nor was it to halt the rise of Zhou—it was to uphold the principle of Zhou. Is this not the primordial *qi* between heaven and earth that cannot be extinguished or exhausted?

Some say that a commoner’s will cannot be altered, that what their lord permitted, Boyi and Shuqi did not permit—this narrows the Way. *The Successful Completion of the War* states: "Heaven aids the people, establishing rulers and teachers for them. Only those who can assist God and soothe the four directions—whether guilty or innocent, how dare I overstep their will?"

The *Record* states: *The Great Declaration* already presents the ruler as the people’s parent, and *The Successful Completion* again presents him as their ruler and teacher—why repeat this? No. Heaven nurtures the myriad things with benevolence and rectifies the people with righteousness.

From the former statement, it is through *ren* (benevolence) that one fully realizes *yi* (righteousness); from the latter, it is through *yi* that *ren* is put into practice. Therefore, none but the Son of Heaven may reverently uphold the canonical rites and ordinances, or command the virtuous to punish the guilty. Once enthroned as the Son of Heaven, if he instead exerts himself without measure, neglects and abandons the sacrifices, where then lie the canonical rites? If he punishes men by exterminating their clans and appoints officials by hereditary succession, where then lies the command to punish and reward? Should one fail to assist in this, yet seek to soothe and favor the realm, the hearing of Heaven and Earth would fall silent, and the spirit of the myriad things would vanish. This is the great *yi* of Heaven and Earth, which awaits the ruler and teacher before it can be enacted in the world. Without King Wu, not a single day could be governed, not a single matter settled, not a single step taken in safety, not a single man preserved. If one harbors even the slightest intention to benefit the world, then guilt is shared equally—how could one ensure that no will is overstepped?

Thus, he overturned the policies of Shang. Governance reverted to the old ways: he freed Jizi from imprisonment, restored the tomb of Bigan, honored Shang Rong’s inquiry, distributed the wealth of Lutai, and released the grain from Juqiao. He bestowed great bounty upon the Four Seas, and the myriad people rejoiced in submission.

The *Record* states: This marked the beginning of his victory over Yin. His deeds and bearing outshone even those of Tang. For the old policies of Shang were the new policies of Zhou. The transmission of the Dao by Jizi could not be absent for a single day; the rites and laws preserved by Shang Rong could not be abolished for a single day; the upright Way upheld by Bigan could not be uprooted for even a day; the will of the people and the heart of Heaven could not be estranged for a single day. The distribution of wealth was not a private favor but a means to enrich the world. The great bounty was not indiscriminate charity but a means to enrich the virtuous. This is why the myriad people rejoiced in submission.

He established five ranks of nobility and three divisions of officers, appointed officials based on worthiness, and assigned positions according to ability. He emphasized the Five Teachings among the people—food, mourning, and sacrifice. He esteemed trustworthiness and illuminated *yi*, exalted virtue and rewarded merit, and with hands folded in his lap, the world was governed.

The *Record* states: This marked the completion of the founding of Zhou. His deeds and bearing left nothing to be ashamed of when measured against antiquity. For the promulgation of the royal standard is the beginning and end of this text. Once the people are enriched, ranks and lands cannot be treated lightly; when one draws near to the radiance of the Son of Heaven, worthiness and ability cannot be neglected; when bestowing upon the common people, the Five Teachings cannot be slighted; when entering governance to enrich life, the people’s sustenance cannot be delayed. By earnestly clarifying trustworthiness and *yi*, the kingly Way is vast and boundless; by exalting virtue and rewarding merit, the kingly Way is level and even. This is how, with hands folded in his lap, the world was governed.

The *Rites of Zhou* states: The king said, "As in the great plans of old, govern before disorder arises, secure the state before danger comes. In the time of Yao and Shun, they examined antiquity and established a hundred offices: within, the Hundred Stewards and the Four Mountains; without, the governors of provinces and the lords of domains. All policies were harmonized, and the myriad states attained peace. In the Xia and Shang dynasties, the number of offices doubled, yet they too were able to employ them effectively. Enlightened kings in establishing governance do not merely consider the offices but the men who fill them. Now I, your humble servant, reverently cultivate virtue, rising early and retiring late, striving to emulate the timely ways of former ages. I instruct and guide my officials, establishing the Grand Preceptor, Grand Tutor, and Grand Protector—these are the Three Dukes. They discourse on the Dao and manage the state, harmonizing and regulating *yin* and *yang*. Offices need not be fully staffed; it is the men that matter. The Junior Preceptor, Junior Tutor, and Junior Protector—these are the Three Solitaries. Together with the Two Dukes, they assist in transforming and illuminating Heaven and Earth, aiding me, the One Man. The Chief Minister oversees the governance of the state, unifies the hundred officials, and equalizes the Four Seas. The Minister of Education oversees the teaching of the state, disseminates the Five Constants, and pacifies the multitudes. The Minister of Rites oversees the rituals of the state, regulates the spirits and the people, and harmonizes high and low. The Minister of War oversees the governance of the state, commands the Six Armies, and pacifies the domains. The Minister of Justice oversees the prohibitions of the state, roots out evil and treachery, and punishes violence and disorder. The Minister of Works oversees the lands of the state, settles the Four Peoples, and ensures the timely use of the earth’s resources. The Six Ministers divide their duties, each leading their subordinates to guide the Nine Governors and enrich the multitudes."

The *Record* states: This is what King Cheng received from the Duke of Zhou’s discourse on the Dao, becoming an enduring ordinance for ten thousand generations. The book of the *Rites of Zhou* speaks of the Three Dukes and Six Ministers, yet in a single phrase summarizes it: "Offices need not be fully staffed; it is the men that matter." The establishment of the Zhou rites comprised three hundred and sixty offices, yet in a single phrase summarizes it: "Do not merely consider the offices; consider the men." The Duke’s intent is thus evident—why then do those who study the Zhou rites remain divided and inconsistent? What the Duke established were the institutions; what he encompassed was the intent. To appreciate the institutions and emulate the intent is sufficient. To scrutinize their details and seek their patterns is not the intention of a good scholar. This *Record* thus concludes with the *Rites of Zhou*.

"Study antiquity to enter office, discuss affairs according to the institutions, and governance will not go astray. You, the constant assistants and teachers, must not let clever speech disrupt your duties. Harboring doubts spoils plans; negligence and indolence lead to abandoned governance. Without learning, one faces the wall; approaching affairs is only troublesome. Warn you, the ministers: achievements are built on resolve, undertakings expand through diligence. Only with decisiveness can future difficulties be avoided. Do not let rank breed arrogance, nor wealth extravagance. Reverence and frugality are virtues; do not burden yourself with deceit. Cultivating virtue brings ease of mind and is called excellence; practicing deceit brings labor of mind and is called clumsiness. Abiding in favor, think of peril—there is nothing not to be feared; without fear, one enters fear. Promote the worthy and yield to the capable, and the various offices will be harmonious. Without harmony, governance becomes cumbersome. Appoint the capable to their offices—this is your responsibility. To recommend those unfit is your failure to bear the task."

The *Record* states: This is what is meant by "do not merely consider the offices; consider the men." For offices are empty vessels; men are their true use. What is meant by "consider the men" is that they must study from youth and practice in maturity. This is the standard for cultivating scholars. Those who advance in this way will surely achieve great deeds and broad undertakings, neither arrogant nor extravagant. Cultivating virtue is called excellence; abiding in favor, they think of peril—this is the bearing of great ministers.

As for recommending the worthy and yielding to the capable, appointing the capable to their offices—this ensures that the duties of office are well-governed, enduringly and without need for correction. This Dao was truly practiced by the Duke of Zhou in his ability to employ men, and by King Cheng in his ability to enact it. Later generations cannot surpass this.

The *Rites of Zhou: Minister of State* states: With the Eight Handles, the king governs his many ministers: first, rank to govern their nobility; second, emolument to govern their wealth; third, removal to govern their offenses; fourth, appointment to govern their conduct; fifth, punishment to govern their transgressions; sixth, bestowal to govern their blessings; seventh, granting to govern their favor; eighth, deprivation to govern their poverty.

The *Record* states: They are called "handles" because they are what one grasps to initiate affairs—the king governs the Nine Provinces and unifies them in his hand. They are called "governance" because they are what one wields to achieve far-reaching ends—the king drives an entire generation and guides them toward goodness. Heaven, though it neither blesses the good nor curses the wicked, cannot make people stand in awe; the ruler, though he neither rewards the good nor punishes the evil, cannot make people submit. What they stand in awe of is not what they love; what they receive in return is not what they favor. The king is the Son of Heaven; the officials are the officers of Heaven. Heaven covers all without partiality—how could the sage have private preferences? Without private preferences, there is neither private love nor private hatred. Thus, rank must match one’s virtue, emolument must match one’s merit, appointments must suit one’s worthiness, and bestowals must suit one’s toil. These are bestowed according to the nature of things, not by my own will. Grants must suit one’s goodness, deprivations must suit one’s offenses, removals must match one’s guilt, and punishments must precisely address one’s transgressions. People seek these for themselves; they are not imposed by the ruler’s will. Thus, without expending excess effort, he can invigorate the Nine Provinces; without wasting spirit, he can drive an entire generation forward.

If, however, rank and emolument are bestowed according to personal favor, while removals and deprivations are imposed on those one hates, this is to disrupt the root and abandon the handle—like rotten reins instead of the six steeds. Such means were intended to instruct the king, yet they instead hasten disaster. How then can they be used for the officers of Heaven? This is the first principle of governing the world—one cannot afford not to know it.

The Grand Minister of Education uses the Eight Punishments to correct the myriad people: first, the punishment for disobedience; second, the punishment for discord; third, the punishment for disrespect; fourth, the punishment for irreverence; fifth, the punishment for incompetence; sixth, the punishment for neglect; seventh, the punishment for slander; eighth, the punishment for disorderly conduct.

The *Record* states: Among the Eight Punishments, why are slander and disorderly conduct included? Speech that accords with principle is not what is meant by "slander." Only the flatterers, sycophants, and wicked who condemn what people universally approve and approve what people universally condemn—those who delight in unrighteousness and entangle others in their webs—bring harm to the world. This is what the *Book of Songs* refers to as "do not indulge in devious compliance, lest you starve the good." Conduct that follows constancy is not what is meant by "disorder." Only those who act recklessly and seek fortune, who cast aside the fundamental norms to pursue illicit ambitions, who disrupt order to hasten their selfish schemes—those whom the good people, like vipers and scorpions, follow without remedy—bring calamity to the realm. This is what the *Book of Songs* refers to as "the people now face peril, gazing at Heaven in confusion." These were the offenses that the ancients were sure to punish.

The *Tan Gong* states: In serving one’s lord, one must admonish without concealment; in attending to his needs, one must follow proper methods. One serves diligently until death, and during the three-year mourning period after his passing.

The *Record* states: Why must one "admonish" the lord? The lord’s heart bears the weight of myriad affairs—his favor can shape a person’s fate, his authority can determine a person’s life, his advancement can bring peace to the world, and his withdrawal can plunge it into peril. When compelled to speak, it concerns matters of life and death, safety and danger. Thus, it is called "admonition." Why must the minister "follow proper methods"? The minister’s loyalty to the lord in life and death is boundless in intent but limited in duty; his responsibilities are vast, yet his strength is insufficient. Thus, the great must not encroach upon the small, nor the low upon the high. When compelled to attend to their respective duties, it concerns matters of fortune and misfortune, honor and disgrace. Thus, it is called "proper methods." Attendants have their duties; "without concealment" is their principle. Responding to "without concealment" with "proper methods," though their roles differ, their admonition is the same. To shirk one’s office and lack responsibility for words, or to restrain others by overstepping one’s bounds—neither is the way of diligent service.

The *No Indulgence* states: The Duke of Zhou said: Alas! The noble person should not be indulgent. First, know the hardships of farming. If one is indulgent, one will understand the common people’s plight. Observe the common people: their fathers and mothers toil in farming, yet their children do not know the hardships of farming—they become indulgent and arrogant. Once spoiled, they will insult their parents, saying: "The people of old knew nothing." The Duke of Zhou said: Alas!

I have heard it said: In former times, the Yin king Zhongzong was reverent and awe-inspired by Heaven’s Mandate. He measured himself, governing the people with fear and trepidation, never daring to indulge in ease. Thus, Zhongzong’s reign endured for fifty-five years.

As for Gaozong, he had once toiled among the common folk. When he ascended the throne, he did not dare to indulge in ease. He brought peace to the Yin state, from the great to the small, so that none harbored resentment at any time. Thus, Gaozong’s reign endured for fifty-nine years.

As for Zu Jia, he understood the plight of the common people and was able to protect and benefit the multitude, never daring to slight the widowed or orphaned. Thus, Zu Jia’s reign endured for thirty-three years.

From that time onward, the kings who were enthroned lived in indulgence. They knew not the hardships of farming, nor heard of the toil of the common folk, only following after pleasure. Thereafter, none among them attained longevity—some reigned ten years, some seven or eight, some five or six, some three or four.

The Duke of Zhou said: Alas!

Yet it was only our Zhou’s Grandfather Tai and Father Ji who were able to restrain themselves in awe. King Wen wore humble attire, engaging in peaceful works and field labors. From dawn until the sun declined past noon, he had no leisure even to eat.

King Wen received the Mandate in his middle years, and his reign endured fifty years.

The Duke of Zhou said: Alas!

From this day forward, let the succeeding kings not be excessive in their pleasures—whether in spectacles, indulgence, hunting, or excursions—using the people’s rightful tribute for such ends. Let them not arrogantly say: "Today we indulge in pleasure," for this is no teaching for the people, nor what Heaven approves. If the people greatly transgress, let there be no repetition of the Yin king’s delusion and disorder, his debauchery in the virtue of wine.

The Duke of Zhou said: Alas!

I have heard it said: The ancients would mutually instruct, mutually protect and benefit, mutually teach and admonish. The people did not deceive one another with sorcery or illusions. Otherwise, their hearts would turn to resentment, their mouths to curses.

The Duke of Zhou said: Alas!

From the Yin king Zhongzong to our Zhou’s King Wen, these four men were enlightened and wise. If someone warned them, saying: "The common folk resent and revile you," they would greatly reverence virtue. If they erred, they would say: "This is my fault," truly reflecting on the matter without delay, never harboring anger.

The Duke of Zhou said: Alas!

Let the succeeding kings take heed of this.

It is recorded: This is the first principle the Duke of Zhou taught King Cheng. Of all things under heaven, none is more base than farming; none more toilsome; yet none more beneficial to the people. And when it reaches its utmost, to personally farm and yet possess all under heaven—none is more perfectly humane. This is the root of Heaven’s Mandate, whether it departs or remains; the source of the people’s hearts, whether they turn toward or away; the foundation of longevity, whether long or short; the proof of virtue and fortune, whether broad or narrow.

Since the founding ancestors, through accumulated merit and layered virtue, for over a thousand years, not a single day has this been forgotten. Yet if one does not know the condition of the common people, this is not the way of enlightenment and wisdom.

For to love ease is the common nature of the people. Moreover, to mutually instruct, mutually teach and admonish, to overlook their resentful reviling and cursing, and instead reflect upon oneself and take responsibility—this is the virtue of "no indulgence," which unites above and below. How could this be only what King Cheng should take heed of? All later worthies and kings must do the same; indeed, for all generations of rulers and ministers, there is no other way.

Thus, each instance of "Alas!" is uttered to deeply express sighs of lamentation and to rouse reflection.

The Duke of Zhou, seeing that King Cheng did not know the hardships of farming, recounted the transformative influence of Hou Ji and Gong Liu, having him recite and chant these lessons morning and night to instruct him.

The poem says:
In the seventh month, the Fire Star declines;
In the ninth month, garments are distributed.
On the first day of the first month, the wind howls;
On the second day, the cold bites—
Without robes, without coarse cloth,
How shall we survive the year?

On the third day, we go to the plow;
On the fourth day, we lift our feet—
With our wives and children,
We head to the southern fields,
Where the Field Overseer comes with joy.

In the seventh month, the Fire Star declines;
In the ninth month, garments are distributed.
In spring, the sun grows warm,
The orioles sing—
Women take their fine baskets,
Following narrow paths,
Seeking tender mulberry leaves.

The spring days lengthen,
The gathering of greens is abundant—
The women’s hearts grow sorrowful,
Fearing they will be taken away with the lord’s sons.

In the seventh month, the Fire Star declines;
In the eighth month, reeds are harvested.
In the silkworm month, mulberry branches are pruned;
Taking axes, new and sharp,
They fell the tall poplars,
Gathering the tender mulberry leaves.

In the seventh month, the shrike cries;
In the eighth month, they spin thread.
They dye black, they dye yellow—
Our crimson is most bright,
For the lord’s sons’ garments.

In the fourth month, the bramble blooms;
In the fifth month, the cicadas sing.
In the eighth month, the harvest is gathered;
In the tenth month, the leaves fall—
On the first day, they hunt the raccoon,
Taking fox and badger pelts,
For the lord’s sons’ furs.

On the second day, they gather,
Drilling and practicing martial arts—
Keeping the small boars for themselves,
Offering the fat ones to the lord.

In the fifth month, the locusts stir their legs;
In the sixth month, the katydids flap their wings.
In the seventh month, they are in the wilds;
In the eighth month, under the eaves;
In the ninth month, at the door;
In the tenth month, the crickets enter beneath our beds.
We block the holes, seal the north windows,
Plaster the doors—
Alas, my lord’s sons,
Saying: "The year is changing,
Come into this dwelling."

In the sixth month, they eat plums and grapes;
In the seventh month, they cook melons and beans;
In the eighth month, they knock down dates;
In the tenth month, they harvest rice—
To brew spring wine,
To prolong life.

In the seventh month, they eat gourds;
In the eighth month, they cut calabashes;
In the ninth month, they gather hemp stalks,
Picking bitter herbs, gathering firewood—
The food of us farmers.

In the ninth month, they build the threshing ground;
In the tenth month, they bring in the harvest—
Millet and glutinous millet, early and late,
Rice and hemp, beans and wheat.
Alas, us farmers!
Our crops now gathered,
We ascend to work on the palace halls—
By day, we gather thatch;
By night, we twist ropes.
Hastily, we climb to roof the houses,
Then begin to sow the hundred grains.

On the second day, they hew ice with a resounding clang;
On the third day, they store it in the icehouse.
On the fourth day, early in the morning,
They offer lambs and leeks in sacrifice.
In the ninth month, the frost descends;
In the tenth month, they sweep the threshing ground.
With paired cups of wine, they feast,
Slaying lambs—
Ascending to the lord’s hall,
Raising the rhinoceros-horn cups,
They wish him: "Ten thousand years without end!"

The Record states: This poem and *The Against Idleness* (《无逸》) complement each other. Observe how every word and meaning is known to the common folk, yet also to the noble. When it reaches its utmost depth, even the sage has not fully exhausted it—truly a text that weaves heaven and earth, a discourse that penetrates high and low. Moreover, it does not present its admonition directly but allows one to chant and reflect upon it indirectly, surpassing the effect of didactic speech.

For song and chant nurture one’s nature and emotions. The young king’s temperament is still unformed, his vital energies unsettled; if blind musicians and tutors present such verses to him, the influence of sycophants and private attendants will be kept at bay. The poems of antiquity are like today’s songs, yet if they are recited morning and night, indulgence and arrogance will be swept away.

Thus, the ancients admonished kings not by forcibly distancing them from music and sensual pleasures, yet these naturally became distant; not by forbidding hunting and excursions, yet these naturally ceased; not by halting their brush to stop writing, yet they unconsciously delved deeper; not by confronting them with remonstrance, yet they unconsciously listened intently. How rare are the three successive rulers who maintained the legacy of their predecessors!

The Duke of Shao accompanied King Cheng on an outing and sang upon the winding slopes of *Juan’e*. Inspired by the king’s song, he composed this to serve as a warning:

*"Oh, the winding slopes of Juan’e,
A whirling wind blows from the south.
O joyful and gracious lord,
Come wander, come sing,
To offer your melody.
How splendid your journey,
How leisurely your repose!
O joyful and gracious lord,
May you fulfill your nature,
And emulate the former lords of old.
Your lands and domains are vast,
Your blessings profound.
O joyful and gracious lord,
May you fulfill your nature,
And preside over the hundred spirits.
Long has your mandate endured,
And your prosperity is secure.
O joyful and gracious lord,
May you fulfill your nature,
And your constancy be pure and enduring.
With strength and support,
With filial piety and virtue,
You are guided and upheld.
O joyful and gracious lord,
A model for the four quarters,
Radiant and majestic,
Like a jade scepter, like a jade tablet,
Your fame and renown resound.
O joyful and gracious lord,
A net for the four directions,
Phoenixes take flight,
Their wings gracefully fluttering,
Alighting together in harmony.
How abundant the king’s noble men,
Whom the lord employs,
Winning the Son of Heaven’s favor.
Phoenixes take flight,
Their plumage resplendent,
Soaring even to the heavens.
How abundant the king’s worthy men,
Whom the lord commands,
Winning the people’s favor.
Hark! The phoenixes cry
Upon that lofty ridge,
Where parasol trees grow.
Facing the morning sun,
Lush and verdant,
Their leaves rustle in the breeze.
The lord’s chariots,
Numerous and abundant;
The lord’s horses,
Trained and swift.
The verses offered are few,
Yet suffice to convey the song."*

The Record states: In contemplating the ancients, their earnest loyalty and devotion to their lords—even in the case of King Cheng of Zhou—cannot be surpassed. Yet observe how they framed their admonition: first, through the delightful setting of *Juan’e* and the pleasing sight of the whirling wind; second, by using song as a vehicle for warning, without harsh or urgent intent. The verses offered were few, lacking pressing words. They began by stirring the king’s personal inclinations and concluded with the auspicious omens of great peace.

Thus did the sages and worthies of antiquity ensure their words were never abandoned, their Dao mutually fulfilled. When their lords heard them, they naturally lingered in leisurely delight, savoring the counsel without perceiving how deeply it resonated within their hearts.

Alas! When the heart is truly aligned, words may be forgotten—what need then for solemn admonition?

**On the Righteousness of Ruler and Minister**

The *Proclamation of King Kang* states: As the king emerged within the Gate of Response, the Grand Protector led the feudal lords of the western regions to enter through the left side of the Gate of Response, while the Duke of Bi led those of the eastern regions to enter through the right. All arrayed their chariots in yellow and vermilion, and as envoys, presented jade tablets and silken gifts, saying: "We, your humble ministers and guards, dare to offer this earth and pledge our allegiance." They bowed twice, touching their heads to the ground. The king, righteous heir to virtue, returned their bow.

The Grand Protector and the Earl of Mao both advanced, saying: "We dare to reverently inform the Son of Heaven: August Heaven altered the great mandate of the state of Yin. Only Kings Wen and Wu of Zhou, having received the blessing of the Supreme Ancestor, were able to succor the western lands. Now, as the new king arises, let rewards and punishments be meted out in full accord, and his achievements be firmly established, that they may be bestowed as blessings upon posterity. Let the present king take heed! Expand and glorify the Six Armies, and do not betray the meager mandate of our exalted ancestors."

The king proclaimed: "Ye feudal lords of the various states—marquises, earls, counts, viscounts, and barons—I, Zhao, hereby respond to your proclamation. In former times, Kings Wen and Wu brought great peace and prosperity, avoiding blame and attaining perfect harmony. They faithfully upheld the luminous mandate throughout the realm, and thus there were valiant warriors and ministers of unwavering loyalty who long preserved the royal house. Now, my uncles and elder ministers, I exhort you to look back and comfort the servants of your former lords, who served the preceding kings. Though your bodies may be afar, let your hearts never stray from the royal court. Thereby shall you attend to their needs and ensure no shame befalls the orphaned heir."

The *Record* states: Former scholars have interpreted the phrase "expand and glorify the Six Armies" as an encouragement for the king to valorize martial prowess. Others have said that in an era of established rule, rulers often indulge in ease and pleasure, lacking resolve—both views are mistaken. The great affairs of the state lie in sacrifice and warfare. When King Kang received the dying charge, the Grand Protector presented the sacrificial vessels, performing the threefold offering and the threefold libation. At that time, the king emerged from the gate to await the lords—there was no extraordinary occasion. Yet the proclamation began with "expand and glorify the Six Armies" precisely to underscore the great affairs of the state. This version of the text aligns with the *Dying Charge*, and for good reason. The king’s returning of bows and the mention of names all pertain to events before his coming of age. Thus, the phrase "righteous heir to virtue" does not imply foreseeing future concerns but rather reflects an overinterpretation.

**On Ruler and Minister**

The king proclaimed: "Junchen, your virtuous conduct is marked by filial piety and reverence. Your filial devotion extends to fraternal love, enabling you to enact good governance. I command you to oversee the eastern suburbs—be diligent!"

"In former times, the Duke of Zhou served as teacher and protector to the myriad people, who cherished his virtue. Go forth and attend to your duties with care, upholding the established norms. Strive to illuminate the Duke of Zhou’s teachings, that the people may long endure. I have heard it said: The fragrance of perfect governance moves the divine spirits. Millet and grain are not the true fragrance—only bright virtue is truly fragrant. You must model yourself on the Duke of Zhou’s plans and teachings, ever diligent, never indulging in ease. Before encountering a sage, one may not be reverent enough to perceive him; after encountering a sage, one may still fail to follow his path. Take heed!"

The *Record* states: In my humble view, though the Duke of Zhou resided in the east for three years, he did not personally oversee Yin. Yet the people of the east cherished him, saying: "Our lord’s son, adorned in embroidered robes." And again: "Do not take our lord away, lest our hearts grieve." The people of Shang had thus already recognized that only bright virtue is truly fragrant. To personally witness a sage is to be moved beyond measure. Precisely because Junchen’s filial piety, fraternal love, reverence, and respect enabled him to emulate the sage, he was commanded to take office and inspired to think of equaling the worthy. King Cheng’s treatment of Junchen was thus most fitting—not because the king sought to transform stubborn subjects by eschewing stern, resolute men in favor of those who embodied filial piety and fraternal love.

Junchen, if this is truly so, then the Way of ruler and minister is narrow indeed. If you have excellent plans and strategies, present them to your lord within the court, then carry them out without. Such counsel and plans shall be the virtue of our lord.

Alas! When all ministers act thus, how illustrious and manifest shall they be! Do not rely on power to intimidate, nor on law to oppress. Be magnanimous yet disciplined, composed yet harmonious. When the people of Yin transgress, I call it transgression; if you refrain from transgressing, I call it pardon; if you refrain from pardon, act with moderation. If there are those who do not conform to your governance or heed your instruction, punish transgression to halt transgression—this is transgression. Those who scheme against the law, subvert norms, and disrupt customs shall not be pardoned for even the slightest offense. Do not harbor resentment toward the stubborn, nor demand perfection from any single person. There must be forbearance—only then can there be success. With tolerance, virtue grows great. Be discerning in cultivating the cultivated, and also in addressing the uncultivated; promote the good to lead those who are not. Truly ascend to the great Way, that I alone may bear the weight of manifold blessings.

The *Record* states: In my humble view, King Cheng’s decree to Junchen was in truth a decree for all ages. For bright virtue and filial piety are the foundation of governance, while loyalty, compliance, magnanimity, and harmony are its instruments. If, in matters of authority, fortune, punishment, and law, or in moments of impulsive action, one errs by currying favor, leaning toward bias, demanding the impossible from others, leading them astray, or expecting perfection, none of these are the Way of perfect goodness. Thus, the king enumerated them all and concluded with the great virtue of forbearance. At that time, King Cheng was in the prime of his years, and what he could not endure or tolerate, he nonetheless proclaimed to others—thereby he could also exhort himself.

If not so, I say "punish," why wait for you not to punish? You say "pardon," why wait for you not to pardon, only to revert to halting punishment?

The *Bi Ming* states: In the twelfth year, on the sixth month and the gengwu day, three days later, on the renshen day, the king walked from Zongzhou in the morning and arrived at Feng. With the multitudes of Chengzhou, he commanded the Duke of Bi to oversee and regulate the eastern outskirts.

The king spoke thus: Alas! Father and Preceptor, it was King Wen and King Wu who spread great virtue throughout the realm, thereby succeeding in receiving the Mandate of Yin. It was the Duke of Zhou who assisted the former kings, stabilized their house, and settled the obstinate people of Yin, relocating them to Luoyi, close to the royal court, to transform them through instruction. After three generations, the world changed and customs shifted; the four quarters were without peril, and I alone enjoyed peace. The Dao rises and falls, governance follows the reform of customs. If one does not excel in excellence, the people will not exert themselves. Only you, Duke, have cultivated virtue, diligently attending to minor matters, aiding and illuminating four reigns. With upright demeanor, you lead those below, none failing to heed your words. Your fine achievements surpass those of the former kings. I, the little one, recline in reverence and rely on your accomplishments.

Now I command you with the affairs of the Duke of Zhou. Go forth! Distinguish the good from the wicked, mark their dwellings, make virtue manifest and evil concealed, establish a model in customs and reputation. Those who do not follow the canonical teachings shall have their fields and borders separated, so they may come to revere and emulate. Clearly delineate the outskirts, carefully secure the frontiers, to bring peace to the four seas. In governance, value consistency; in speech, uphold essential principles, not merely favoring the unusual.

The customs of Shang are decadent; glib speech is deemed worthy. The remnants of this wind have not yet vanished—bear this in mind, Duke! It was the Duke of Zhou who was prudent at the beginning, Lord Chen who harmonized the middle, and you, Duke, who will perfect the end. The three lords, with unified hearts, together attain the Dao. When the Dao permeates governance, its blessings moisten the people. The four barbarians, with robes folded left, all rely on this. May I, the little one, forever receive manifold blessings.

The *Record* states: In my humble view, the command to oversee and regulate was not solely for the obstinate people of Yin. Indeed, King Cheng’s system divided the realm in two, governing through the Two Lords. East of the Shan, the Duke of Zhou presided; his successor was Lord Chen; and the next successor was the Duke of Bi. Thus, upon ascending the throne, he regularly led the eastern lords to enter the Gate of Response. How solemn was his command—yet it was not his first departure. When the king newly ascended the throne, there were always words of announcement, yet the Duke of Shao, as the Western Lord, alone had none. Was this because he remained to assist the Son of Heaven? Or was it an omission in the records? We cannot know.

When it speaks of "settling the obstinate people of Yin," it refers to their origins. When it speaks of "the customs of Shang and the men of Yin," the people of Zhou always took Yin as their model in all matters—was this merely the language of announcement? Their poems all say: "The men of Yin are fair and keen, the descendants of Shang," and so on. When it says, "Distinguish the good from the wicked, make virtue manifest and evil concealed," this is the fundamental task of the state, not merely zeal for Yin. Nor does it mean that the Duke of Zhou’s strenuous efforts to subdue Yin were merely prudence at the beginning, or that Lord Chen’s tolerance harmonized the middle. Only now can one truly distinguish the good from the wicked.

All commentators fail to grasp the main purport of the classic text, taking the subjugation of the obstinate people of Yin in Luoyi alone as their focus. Thus, the grand intent of overseeing and regulating becomes a partial discourse on transforming Yin, not the legacy of King Kang’s reverent reliance on accomplishment. Clinging to one side, they nearly obstruct the passages on "the four quarters without peril," "bringing peace to the four seas," "blessings moistening the people," and "the four barbarians all relying on this." Readers must correct their understanding accordingly.

I have heard it said: Families with hereditary emoluments rarely abide by ritual, and their dissolute conduct violates virtue, truly contravening the heavenly Dao. The corruption of customs through extravagance flows the same through ten thousand generations. These many men of Yin, seated in the favor of old privileges, recklessly abandon righteousness to vie in finery, indulging in arrogance, excess, and self-importance, tending toward a wicked end. Though one may recover a wayward heart, restraining it is difficult. Wealth and nobility can instruct, but only through enduring years; only righteousness is the great instruction of the times. Without following the ancient teachings, how can one be instructed?

The *Record* states: In my humble view, how earnest was King Cheng’s warning to the men of Yin! A widespread reputation and far-reaching praise attach to oneself—why then covet another’s embroidered robes? The deceptive cap of Zizang of Zheng and the jade pendants of Dechen of Chu both ended in misfortune. And not only these. The nature that delights in fine food, the winds of seductive beauty, the desires of intoxication, the passions for wealth—these are all inevitable. Yet with the weight of royal commands, one cannot intermingle familiarity and levity. Thus, he spoke only of vying in finery.

Alas! Even in the Three Dynasties, this was so—how much more in later ages! This is why those who neither indulge nor seek are so difficult to select.

The *Jun Ya* states: The king spoke thus: Alas! Lord Ya, your grandfather and father were steadfast in loyalty and integrity, serving the royal house with labor, their achievements recorded on the grand banners. I, the little one, inherit the legacy of Wen, Wu, Cheng, and Kang, and also rely on the ministers of the former kings. Assisting in governing the four quarters, my heart’s anxieties are like treading on a tiger’s tail or crossing spring ice.

Now I command you to be my wing, my limbs and heart’s core. Polish your inherited service, do not disgrace your ancestors. Vastly spread the Five Canons, harmonizing the people’s norms. In your own conduct, be upright; dare not fail to be upright. The people’s hearts lack constancy; only your constancy can be their guide. In summer’s heat and rain, the little people only sigh in resentment; in winter’s bitter cold, the little people also only sigh in resentment—how arduous it is! Contemplate its difficulty to plan for ease, and the people will be at peace. Alas!

Greatly illustrious were the counsels of King Wen!
Greatly enduring were the achievements of King Wu!
They aided and enlightened their successors, all maintaining rectitude without flaw.

*Recorded thus: This refers to King Mu.*
The Master—would he have approved? He said, "No."
I observe that in the former court, there were no lack of chariot tracks and horse trails,
yet the paths of public and private affairs were ever divided into two distinct Ways.
Thus, the great principles of governance—laws, punishments, rites, and music—were the domain of impartial selection.
Indulgence in pleasure, excursions, music, beauty, wealth, and profit were the offerings of private desire.
The public was never to be abandoned for the sake of the private,
nor was the private to encroach upon the public.
The two proceeded in parallel without conflict, and thus disorder was averted.
Did not the Master say: "Zhong Buyu managed guests, Wangsun Jia commanded the army"?
How could the state have declined if King Mu had exercised his private judgment,
appointing Zaofu as his heart and core instead of Jun Ya as Minister of Education,
confounding the Five Teachings and Five Canons into a single path,
and mingling the noble and the base in key positions?
Then who would have planned for the sighs of resentment from the common people?
Who would have carried forward the counsels and instructions of Wen and Wu?
The sages included this in the Classics precisely to show that the constant norms must not be disordered,
and the great principles must not be neglected—its meaning is profound.

*The "Same Mandate" states:*
The king proclaims: "Bo Tong, I am inadequate in virtue, yet I succeed my ancestors to occupy this great legacy.
Restless and vigilant, I rise in the dead of night, striving to avoid error.
In the time of Wen and Wu, wisdom and sagacity were complete;
their ministers, great and small, were all loyal and good.
Their attendants, servants, and retinue were without exception upright men,
who from dawn to dusk assisted and corrected their lord.
In his going out and coming in, his rising and resting, there was none who did not revere him;
in his proclamations and decrees, there was none that was not excellent.
The people below revered and obeyed, and the myriad states achieved prosperity.
But I, alone, am without goodness. I rely entirely on the officers before and behind me,
who correct my shortcomings, restrain my errors, and rectify my misjudgments,
guiding me to overcome my unworthy heart and enabling me to carry forward the legacy of the former kings.
Now I command you to serve as Grand Rectifier, to oversee the attendants, servants, and retinue.
Exert yourself in cultivating the virtue of your lord, mutually refining what is lacking.
Carefully select your colleagues; do not employ those who are glib of speech and fair of face,
or those who are obsequious, fawning, and sycophantic.
Only the auspicious man—if the servants are upright, their lord will be upright;
if the servants flatter, their lord will deem himself sagely.
The lord’s virtue depends on his ministers; his lack of virtue also depends on his ministers.
Do not be intimate with petty men, who fill the offices of his ears and eyes.
Lead your superior away from the canons of the former kings—
if a man is not virtuous, his auspiciousness is not in his person but in his wealth.
If at any time you fail in reverence for your office,
unable to respect your lord, I will hold you accountable."

*Recorded thus: This refers to the Rectifier of Servants.*
As seen in the *Rites of Zhou*, these were the duties of officers,
those with whom the king associated day and night, never leaving his side in his movements and repose.
Their subordinates included:
- the Sacrificial Attendants, who assisted in rites;
- the Chamberlains, who attended to his rising and retiring;
- the Chariot Officers, who managed his war chariots;
- the Equipage Officers, who prepared his ceremonial carriages;
- the Stewards, who oversaw his household.
If the right men were chosen, their influence would be gradual and transformative,
leading the king toward goodness without his awareness.
If the wrong men were chosen, their flattery and blindness would lead him into evil unawares.
In later ages, when eunuchs were exclusively employed,
and favorites were indulged without official duties or the responsibility of remonstrance,
they concerned themselves only with glib speech, fair faces, obsequiousness, and flattery,
offering flattering words to gain favor and promoting greed to accept bribes.
Even in the Three Dynasties, historians foresaw the beginnings of this trend.
Though the mandate was given to Bo Tong, it was truly an instruction for all ages—
not waiting until the roots of disorder had formed before its evils became manifest.

---

It is further said: These two texts were composed by the benevolent and upright scholars of the time,
who spoke with sincerity to exhort their ministers—
precisely to move the king.
Yet observe: in one it is said, "their lord will deem himself sagely,"
and in the other, "his auspiciousness is in his wealth."
These two phrases are the root of the malady.
Was King Mu one who deferred to others?
He galloped and indulged himself, comparing himself to Yao and Shun or the lands of Lu and Fang.
He rejected remonstrance and concealed his faults, yet claimed the sagacity of Yu and Tang.
He had no leisure for rest, yet excused himself with the diligence of Wen and Wu.
Only then did he act with complete abandon, without restraint.
Once extravagant desires arose, who would suffice to satisfy the state?
This is why the *Lü Xing* speaks of redemption throughout—
the weight of wealth in that era is evident.
Yet it earnestly hoped that his servants would restrain his errors and correct his faults,
warning his ears and eyes against obsequiousness and flattery.
This was truly a skillful admonition of the ruler.
But whether Bo Wen would listen and take heed, or whether he would take it upon himself—
I cannot know, and thus cannot hold him accountable.

In the *Guoyu*, when King Mu planned to campaign against the Great Rong, Jigong Moufu remonstrated, saying: "It must not be done. The former kings radiated virtue and did not display military force. When arms are sheathed, they move only in due season; when they move, they inspire awe. To display them is to make a spectacle, and spectacle breeds contempt, leaving no reverence for the former kings’ way with the people. They cultivated upright virtue and enriched their nature, enriched their resources and improved their tools, clarified the paths of profit and harm, and refined them with culture. Thus they made the people pursue profit and avoid harm, cherish virtue and stand in awe of power—thereby preserving their reign and prospering.

The former kings’ system divided the realm thus: within the royal domain, the *dian* service; beyond it, the *hou* service; beyond that, the *bin* service; farther still, the *yao* service; and at the outer reaches, the *huang* service. Those in *dian* service offered sacrifices; those in *hou* service, seasonal rites; those in *bin* service, feasts; those in *yao* service, tribute; and those in *huang* service, acknowledged the king’s suzerainty. The rule was: monthly sacrifices, seasonal feasts, annual tribute—this was the former kings’ teaching. If sacrifices were neglected, they refined their intentions; if seasonal rites were omitted, they refined their words; if feasts were not held, they refined their culture; if tribute was withheld, they refined their reputation; if suzerainty was unrecognized, they refined their virtue. Once the proper order was established, if any still failed to comply, they applied punishments. Thus, those who did not sacrifice were punished; those who did not perform seasonal rites were attacked; those who did not feast were chastised; those who did not pay tribute were reprimanded; and those who did not acknowledge the king were admonished. Hence there were penal laws, punitive expeditions, campaigns of chastisement, commands of censure, and proclamations of reproof. If proclamations were issued and words delivered, yet compliance still failed, they further refined their virtue and spared the people distant labor. Thus, those near obeyed without fail, and those far submitted without resistance.

Now, since the death of the Great Bi and Bo Shi, the Great Rong have come to court in fulfillment of their duty. Yet the Son of Heaven says: ‘I shall punish them for their failure to feast and display my military might.’ Is this not to abandon the former kings’ teaching and bring the royal house to near ruin? I have heard that the Great Rong are steadfast in loyalty, able to follow ancient virtue and maintain unswerving constancy. They may well resist us."

The king did not heed him and proceeded with the campaign, returning with four white wolves and four white deer. From then on, those in *huang* service ceased to come.

A note observes: This was the beginning of the decline that led to King You’s murder. As the saying goes, ‘Treading on frost, one foresees solid ice’—calamity does not arise in a single day. From Mu to Kang was but two generations. The legacy of Wen and Wu still flourished, and the foundations of great peace remained unshaken. What was there to fear from the paltry Great Rong? Yet they did not realize that the venom of wasps and scorpions, once brewed, would swell into a deluge. The fall of the House of Zhou began here. The *Guoyu*’s opening admonition echoes Confucius’ intent.

Yet even with such warnings, there have been those who, without cause, schemed to conquer Yan, only to bring about the Jingkang disaster; and those who, recklessly launching northern expeditions, reaped the sorrow of Ya Mountain. Does not Mencius say: ‘A state that attacks itself will be attacked by others’? Is this not what is meant by ‘radiating virtue and not displaying military force’?

When King Li favored Rong Yigong, Yin Liangfu said: "The royal house will surely decline. Rong values monopolizing profit yet knows nothing of great peril. Profit is what gives rise to the myriad things, what heaven and earth sustain. To monopolize it invites great harm. Heaven, earth, and the myriad things all seek it—how can it be monopolized? The resentments it provokes will be many, yet he makes no provision against great peril. Can one who teaches the king thus endure for long? The king’s duty is to guide profit and distribute it throughout the realm, ensuring that gods, men, and the myriad things all attain their fullest potential. Even then, one must remain vigilant, fearing the rise of grievances. How can the king be taught to monopolize profit? Even a commoner who monopolizes profit is called a thief; if a king does so, few will follow him. If Rong Yigong is employed, Zhou will surely fall."

After Rong Yigong became minister, the feudal lords ceased their feasts, and the king was exiled to Li.

A note observes: How could profit alone sustain the royal house? When Zhou arose, it first dispersed the wealth of Lutai and then distributed the grain of Juqiao. The realm turned toward it as if blown by the wind, and governance and punishment were nearly set aside—people still praise it to this day. Yet as it declined, it was said: ‘Only goods are auspicious,’ and ‘All ends in wealth.’ The royal house gradually weakened until it was no better than the feudal states. From then on, the Son of Heaven descended to the hall to receive the lords. Yin Bo’s words were a timely warning, a mirror from Yin’s fall.

Though later sages and worthies—like Zihan, who spoke little of profit; Zengzi, who took rightness as profit; and Mencius, who also spoke of profit—differed in expression, their intent and purport were the same. As the age declined and the Dao waned, men clung to private desires. Only then did Liangfu’s words prove true. The Way of Wen and Wu had not yet fallen to earth, which is why, though there were the troubles of Yi, Li, You, and Ping, they did not end in the total ruin of head-counts and basket-levies.

The *Book of Songs* records Fan Bo’s rebuke of King Li:
"The Lord on High is perverse,
The common people utterly afflicted.
His words are not right,
His plans not far-reaching.
The wise are frivolous,
Not steadfast in uprightness.
His plans are not far-reaching—
Thus I offer great admonition.

When Heaven brings calamity,
Do not be so gleeful;
When Heaven topples the state,
Do not be so careless.
Words well-ordered,
The people are harmonious;
Words well-chosen,
The people are at peace.

Though our duties differ,
We share the same office.
I join you in counsel—
Hear my earnest plea.
My words are for service,
Do not take them as jest.
The ancients said:
‘Consult even the humble.’

When Heaven brings cruelty,
Do not be so reckless.
This old man speaks sincerely,
You, young man, are so constrained.
It is not that my words are senile—
You take them as raving.
The more you add to the flames,
The harder it is to save.

When Heaven brings disorder,
Do not be so obsequious.
Dignity is utterly lost,
The good play dead.
When the people are in distress,
None dare speak out.
Disaster and chaos abound,
Yet none show kindness to our hosts.

Heaven guides the people
Like ocarina and flute,
Like zhang and gui jades,
Like grasping and seizing.
Do not say ‘It is enough’—
Guiding the people is easy indeed."

When the people abound in depravity,
Do not set your own depravity.
The common folk are the fence,
The great army is the wall,
The great state is the screen,
The great clan is the pillar.
Embracing virtue brings tranquility,
The eldest son is the city.
Let not the city crumble,
Lest solitude breed fear.

Revere Heaven’s wrath,
Dare not jest or idle.
Revere Heaven’s descent,
Dare not gallop recklessly.
Vast Heaven is bright—
As you go forth to rule.
Vast Heaven is radiant—
As you wander in leisure.

The Record says: What is called reversal
Is when brightness shines below
And majesty above—this is the constant.
When the Supreme is perverse,
The people below perish—this is reversal.
In times of calamity, stumbling, cruelty, and disorder,
Heaven’s wrath has not long endured.
When all is flourishing, lax, clamorous, and frivolous,
The beginning’s intent slackens into complacency.

For human nature is such:
Without far-reaching vision or grand strategy,
The heart assumes no further peril,
And the sage’s warnings seem unwarranted.
One grows content with mere expediency, unaware.
If stern admonition could guide them,
And upright counsel correct them,
It might yet curb their reckless hearts
And restrain their rash habits,
Dispelling strife and monstrosity—
Perhaps then there would be hope.

Yet if petty men do not deceive with grand words,
They flatter with smooth talk.
Thus their hearts grow wanton,
Deceiving Heaven and deluding men without limit.
Then treacherous, unprincipled men enter,
And cruel, fearless deeds arise.
The good can do nothing,
And the people’s suffering reaches its extremity.
This is the origin of such decline.

Boundless is the Supreme,
The people’s sovereign.
Swift and stern is the Supreme,
Whose decrees are full of perversity.
Heaven births the black-haired people,
Yet its mandate is not steadfast.
All have a beginning,
Few endure to the end.

King Wen sighed,
“Alas, you, Yin-Shang!
Once so strong in defense,
Once so resolute in governance,
Once so steadfast in office,
Once so diligent in service.
Heaven sent down corrupt virtue,
And you exerted yourselves for it.”

King Wen sighed,
“Alas, you, Yin-Shang!
Holding to what is right,
Your defenses grew cunning,
Responding with slander,
And brigands thrived within.
Curses and imprecations arose,
Without end or limit.”

King Wen sighed,
“Alas, you, Yin-Shang!
You brought no order to the central lands,
But amassed resentment as virtue.
Your virtue was not bright,
Neither turning away nor aside.
With virtue so dim,
You had no ministers, no counselors.”

King Wen sighed,
“Alas, you, Yin-Shang!
Heaven did not drown you in wine,
Nor did it sanction wrongdoing.
Yet your conduct strayed,
Neither day nor night discerned.
With shouts and cries,
You turned day into night.”

King Wen sighed,
“Alas, you, Yin-Shang!
Like cicadas, like crickets,
Like boiling broth.
Great and small neared ruin,
Yet men still followed your ways.
Within, you ravaged the central lands,
And your reach extended to distant lands.”

King Wen sighed,
“Alas, you, Shang!
The Supreme is not timely,
Yin abandoned the old.
Though no elders remained,
There were still ancient models.
Yet you heeded none,
And the great mandate toppled.”

King Wen sighed,
“Alas, you, Yin-Shang!
Men have a saying:
When the roots are uprooted,
The branches and leaves cannot endure.
The mirror of Yin is not distant—
It lies in the age of the Xia.”

The Record says: This speaks of its end.
The distance between benevolence and tyranny is vast.
Yet it is not that Heaven bestowed different natures—
It is what ensnares the heart.
And so the decline reached such depths:
No order within, chaos without,
Like cicadas’ din, like boiling broth.

Confucius did not say,
“Zhou’s evil was not so extreme.”
Thus the noble man hates to dwell in the lower currents,
For all the world’s evils gather there.

At that time, the ministers of state,
From the Duke of Zhou and the Duke of Shao downward,
Mao, Ji, Ran, and Zai—
All shared the nation’s joys and sorrows.
Their lament could not but be deep,
Their grief could not but be keen.
Thus it is said:
“The fierce wind tests the sturdy grass,
In turmoil, loyal ministers are known.”
Through the ages,
Who would not sigh again and again?

King Xuan of Zhou, within, harbored the will to restore order.
Alarmed by disaster, he turned himself to cultivation,
Seeking to dispel it.
The realm rejoiced as royal governance returned,
And the people saw his concern.
Still Shu composed a poem in praise, saying:

“Mournful is that Milky Way,
Shining in the heavens.
The king said, ‘Alas! What guilt have the people of today?
Heaven sends down ruin and chaos,
Famine and starvation follow one upon another.
No god is left uninvoked,
No sacrifice withheld.
The jades and ritual tablets are spent,
Yet none heed my plea.

The drought is too severe,
The heat oppressive, sweltering.
No village rites are spared,
From the suburbs to the ancestral temples.
Above and below, no offering is neglected,
No god left unvenerated.
Yet Hou Ji does not respond,
The Supreme does not descend.
The land below is laid waste—
Why must it befall me?

The drought is too severe,
It cannot be averted.
Diligent and reverent,
Like thunder, like lightning,
The remnant of Zhou’s people
Are left with none surviving.
Vast Heaven, Supreme,
Why do you not aid us?
Why do you not fear
The wrath of our ancestors?

The drought is too severe,
It cannot be washed away.
Scorching, blazing,
We have no refuge.
The great mandate nears its end,
None look back, none heed.
The former lords and ministers
Do not assist us.
Our fathers and ancestors,
How can you bear this?

The drought is too severe,
Rivers and mountains run dry.
The drought-demon rages,
Devouring, burning.
My heart dreads the heat,
My sorrow is like dye.
The former lords and ministers
Do not hear us.
Vast Heaven, Supreme,
Will you let us wander?

The drought is too severe,
I strive in fear to depart.
Why do you afflict me with drought,
So suddenly, without cause?
I have prayed early and earnestly,
Made offerings to the gods of earth and grain.
Vast Heaven, Supreme,
Why do you not protect us?
Reverent and respectful to the bright spirits,
There should be no regret or wrath.

The drought is too severe,
All bonds are broken.
Alas, the many ministers,
Alas, the steward of the household!”

The Masters of the Horse and the Household Stewards,
The royal chefs and attendants—
No one is uninvolved,
None can cease their duties.

Gazing up to Vast Heaven,
What is to be done?
Gazing up to Vast Heaven,
Its stars are dim and ravenous.
Great officers and noble lords,
Make your bright prayers without fail.
The great mandate draws near its end—
Do not abandon what you have achieved.
What do you seek for me,
To bring ruin upon the many ministers?
Gazing up to Vast Heaven,
When will it grant us peace?

**Recorded Note:** This is the foundation of King Xuan’s restoration.
To regard the people as if wounded—this was the true heart of King Wen’s ancestor.
The Grand Minister of Education, with the twelve famine policies, gathered the myriad people—this was the practical affair of the *Rites of Zhou*.
With a true heart seeking true action, how could one not be earnest and vigilant, as if reviving from fire?
Here we see that the former kings did not use routine measures as an excuse, nor did they resort to vague indifference, but rather took it upon themselves to bear the burden. Only then did the many ministers cry out in distress, and the steward of the household grieve.
No one is uninvolved,
None can cease their duties.
If even a single thought of slackness arises, I see the Three Dukes and great officers no longer toiling day and night, the feudal lords no longer attending morning and evening—how then could they stabilize the many offices?
Thus, the words of Emperor Wu of Han on water and drought as mere routine, and Emperor Shenzong of Song on heavenly portents as nothing to fear, were but their own regrets, not the regrets of others.
Alas!
Those who grasp heat without washing will never cease; those who fear disaster only when it strikes will turn back in an instant.
This sudden collapse and abrupt revival cannot be spoken of in the same breath.
When the House of Zhou was in decline, the myriad people scattered, yet King Xuan was able to toil and gather them, returning and settling the wandering masses. The people rejoiced and composed a poem, saying:
*The swans and geese take flight,
Their wings rustling in formation.
These men on the march toil and labor,
In the wilds they reach even the bereaved—
In a single dawn, the widowed and orphaned.*

*The swans and geese take flight,
Gathering in the central marsh.
These men build walls a hundred spans high,
Though they toil and labor,
In the end, they secure a peaceful home.*

*The swans and geese take flight,
Their cries resounding in unison.
These wise men call me toiling,
Those fools call me proud.*

**Recorded Note:** This was the governance of King Xuan’s restoration.
Only with a heart of diligence, caution, and vigilance could there be policies of toil and gathering, of settling the people.
Before the *Lesser Odes*, the *Sixth Month* stands at the head of its achievements.
This record is made.
As for the profound meaning of the swans and geese—it differs from the mere praise of cicadas and crickets.

A great officer, reproaching King You, said:
*“In the royal month, frost thickens,
My heart is filled with sorrow.
The people’s rumors spread,
And greatly they swell.
Thinking of myself alone,
My anxious heart is heavy.
Pity my timid heart,
Wracked with pain and distress.
My parents gave me life—
Why must I suffer so?
Not before me, not after me—
Good words come from the mouth,
Weeds come from the same mouth.
My anxious heart grows heavier,
Thus I am humiliated.
My anxious heart is restless,
Thinking of my ill fortune.
The people’s innocence is lost,
Even their servants are enslaved.
Pity us, the people here—
From whom shall we seek fortune?
Watching the crows alight,
Upon whose roof do they settle?
Gazing at the central grove,
Now kindling, now brushwood.
The people now face peril,
Heaven’s will is dark and confused.
Once order is established,
No one will fail to prevail.
August Heaven above—
Who does it truly hate?
They say the mountains are low,
Yet they become deceptive ridges.
The people’s rumors spread—
Why is no one to restrain them?
Summon the elders of old,
Question them on their dreams.
All claim to be sages—
Who knows if the crow is male or female?
They say Heaven is high,
Yet one dare not stand upright;
They say the earth is thick,
Yet one dare not tread firmly.
Who utters such words,
With reason and kinship?
Why do the people today
Act like venomous snakes?
Gazing at those slope fields,
The solitary reeds stand tall.
Heaven has burdened me,
As if it cannot endure me.
When I seek them, they flee,
As if they cannot find me.
They grasp me with enmity,
Nor do they aid me.
My heart’s sorrow,
Is like a knot tied within.
This year’s governance—
Why is it so harsh?
The fire blazes high,
Yet someone may extinguish it.
Radiant was the House of Zhou,
Yet Bao Si destroyed it.
Ever I ponder this,
Now beset by dark clouds.
The cart is loaded,
Yet you discard its supports.
The load is shifted,
‘Elder brother, help me!’
Do not discard the supports,
Strengthen the spokes.
Turn often to your driver,
Lest the load shift.
Though you traverse perilous paths,
How could you not be mindful?
The fish in the pond
Are not truly at ease.
Though they hide in the depths,
They are clearly seen.
My heart is filled with sorrow,
Thinking of the state’s cruelty.
There is fine wine,
And excellent dishes.
In harmony with neighbors,
Marriage ties are close.
Thinking of myself alone,
My heart is deeply troubled.
Those in distress have homes,
The trembling have grain.
The people now are ill-fated—
Heaven marks them for ruin.
How strange the wealthy—
They too reach this bitter solitude!”*

**Recorded Note:** The *anguish* spoken of in *The Planks* and *The Ruin*—that was the time of heavenly reprimand. The *anguish* in this poem—this is the time of self-abandonment.
The *destruction* in *The Mulberry*—that was the day disorder arose. The *destruction* in this poem—this was the day of the state’s collapse.
For the cruel and violent reign of King Li, and the debauchery of King You that brought it to its extreme—this is why Heaven and earth seemed to offer no refuge.
Yet this poem both names Bao Si as the one who brought ruin and refers to the enslavement of ministers—taboo words—yet it was not charged as slanderous or seditious. Had there been no tragedy of kin or the disaster of the Quan Rong, it might have been foretold.
Alas! The spokes break, the wheels shatter—yet no one could stop it.
Heaven’s benevolence could not overcome human delusion—how pitiful!

On the conjunction of the tenth month, at the new moon on the day *xinmao*, the sun was eclipsed—how utterly foul!
That moon was dimmed, and now this sun is dimmed.
The people below today—how utterly wretched!
Sun and moon foretell calamity, yet their paths are not heeded;
The four lands lack governance, and their worthy men are not employed.
That the moon is eclipsed is but its usual course;
That the sun is eclipsed—what is not amiss?
Thunder crashes and lightning flashes, unsettling and unruly.
The hundred rivers boil and surge, mountains and hills collapse.
High banks become valleys, deep ravines become mounds.
The people of this wretched age—why do they not correct their transgressions?
The Grand Minister Huangfu, Fan as Minister of Education,
Jiabo as Steward, Zhongyun as Master of the Kitchen,
Zhizi as Internal Scribe, Jue as Master of the Horse,
and Qiao as Master of the Guards—his favored wife stirs trouble in every quarter.

Yet this Huangfu—was he not appointed in due time?
Why then does he act against me, refusing to consult me?
He tears down my walls and houses, leaving my fields to rot and my crops to wither.
He says, "I do not harm you—such is the ritual propriety."
Huangfu, so sagely wise, builds a capital at Xiang,
selecting three officials for his service, all men of wealth and rank.
Not a single elder is left behind to guard our king.
He chooses those with chariots and horses to dwell in Zu and Xiang.
I toil diligently, never daring to complain of hardship.
Innocent and blameless, yet slanderous tongues clamor against me.
The people’s suffering is not sent down from Heaven—
it arises from those who lead them astray and incite hatred, all by human hands.
Oh, my homeland—how grievously afflicted!
All around, others live in ease, while I alone dwell in sorrow.
None rest, yet I dare not cease my labor.
Heaven’s decree is not yet fulfilled; I dare not follow my peers in complacency.

---

*Recorded Note:*
According to the *Rites of Zhou*, the Three Dukes deliberate on the Dao, and the Six Ministers divide their duties—there is no such office as "Prime Minister." Yet in King You’s reign, beyond the Six Ministers, he established the office of *Du Guan* to oversee all six ministries, though it was not a prime ministerial post. How then did Huangfu alone disrupt the established order, bringing about the ominous eclipse even in the pure yang month of the tenth? It was because King You’s virtue was benighted and weak, heaping disaster upon the common people. Construction of private estates never ceased, and ministers colluded in factions—how long could the state endure?

Alas!
In King Li’s time, the laws were not yet abolished;
In King You’s age, not a single elder was spared.
In King Li’s time, monopolies were held by the throne;
In King You’s age, private enrichment was rampant.
Though both kings brought ruin upon themselves, the survival of the royal house differed—why?

When the Zhou court was forced to relocate eastward, the ministers, passing through the old ancestral temples and palaces now overgrown with millet and sorghum, grieved for the fallen altars of state. Hesitating, unable to bear leaving, they composed a poem:

*"Those millets stand in rows, those sorghums sprout anew.
My steps are slow, my heart adrift.
Those who know me say my heart is full of sorrow;
Those who know me not ask what I seek.
Oh, boundless Heaven—who is this man?"*

*Recorded Note:*
When Confucius spoke of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, he said: *"Those who know me will do so through the* Spring and Autumn*; those who condemn me will do so through the* Spring and Autumn."*
Is this different from the poem’s *"Those who know me say my heart is full of sorrow; those who know me not ask what I seek"*?
No, there is no difference.
The eastern relocation was no minor upheaval. For the Son of Heaven, it meant regicide; for ministers and sons, it meant humiliation; for the altars of state, it meant destruction; for the ancestral temples, it meant ruin. Since the dawn of time, there had never been a catastrophe so great. Yet at the time, no one questioned it. The lord grew complacent in serving his enemies, the ministers in enduring disgrace. Heaven and earth closed, yet none sought to open them; the people’s hearts perished, yet none sought to revive them. Did they not see the rows of millet and ask, *"What do I seek?"*
It was grief for the collapse of royal governance, fear that Heaven’s punishment would be abandoned—thus they wished to advance but could not move forward.
Those who knew them understood: they sighed at the sight of millet, grieved at the desolation of temples and halls.
Those who did not know them asked: *"Why does a mere minister presume to bear the burden of survival, overstep his bounds to plan for the altars of state, attempt what is impossible, and strive for what cannot be achieved?"*
Hence: *"What do I seek?"*
Yet in truth, they could not forget it for even a moment. Thus they cried out to Heaven in lament—not for themselves, nor from overstepping their station.
When our Master edited the *Book of Songs*, he deeply grasped this sentiment, which is why he echoed it to show that the *Spring and Autumn Annals* could not be abandoned, nor could the ministers’ lament be suppressed.
How profound!

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* begins: *"In the first year of Duke Yin of Lu, in spring, in the king’s first month..."*

*Recorded Note:*
When the *Songs* perished, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* arose. The *Spring and Autumn* was composed to teach the principles of the world for ten thousand generations—yet where did these principles first take root?
At that time, the true king had ceased to rule, the feudal lords ran wild, and governance and decrees no longer reached the realm. Thus, each lord recorded their own years, no longer observing the Son of Heaven’s calendar; each state chronicled its own affairs, no longer adhering to the king’s universal authority. What an age this was!
Shaozi said: *"The time of the Five Hegemons was like winter."*
Like winter—when earth’s *qi* does not rise, Heaven’s *qi* does not descend, all is closed and stagnant. How could one hope for the return of spring?
Even Zigong, so wise and capable, wished to abolish the practice of presenting the sacrificial lamb at the announcement of the new moon. The Master told him: *"You love the lamb, but I love the ritual."*
This ritual is why the Middle Kingdom does not resemble the barbarian tribes, why the Dao does not resemble the beasts. Why? The barbarians do not recognize a lord; the beasts do not recognize spring. Can men be less than they?
First, the king; then, spring—how solemn is the principle of Great Unity!
To violate it is to invite unforgivable punishment; to usurp it is to incur unrecorded guilt.

The rectification of the fundamental norms elevates the dignity of the hierarchical order; the establishment of human principles gives rise to ritual and righteousness. Thus, the great righteousness between ruler and minister endures alongside Heaven and Earth without fail.

*Hongdao Lu*, Scroll Twelve, concludes. #1 "Shang" was originally written as "商," corrected here according to the context.

*Hongdao Lu*, Scroll Thirteen: *Righteousness*
**The Righteousness Between Ruler and Minister**

From the *Records of the Grand Historian*: The Han King crossed south at Pingyin Ford and arrived at Luoyang. Dong Gong, the Tribal Elder of Xincheng, intercepted and addressed the King, saying: "I have heard that those who follow virtue prosper, while those who defy it perish. If an army marches without just cause, its affairs will not succeed. Therefore, it is said: ‘Make clear that they are rebels, and the enemy may then be subdued.’ Xiang Yu acted without the Dao, deposing and killing his lord—he is a traitor to all under Heaven. Now, benevolence does not rely on courage, nor righteousness on brute strength. Your Majesty should lead the Three Armies in mourning attire, proclaiming this to the feudal lords and then punishing him." Thereupon, the King held a funeral for Emperor Yi, announcing to the lords: "All under Heaven jointly enthroned Emperor Yi, yet Xiang Yu has deposed and killed him. I personally mourn him, and my troops all wear white. I will mobilize all forces from within the Pass, gather the warriors of the Three Rivers, and sail south along the Yangtze and Han to join the feudal kings in attacking the one who murdered Emperor Yi."

The compiler notes: This single act secured the Han’s four hundred and twenty years of rule. The grand principle and great righteousness that shine as brightly as the sun and stars originate precisely here. Alas, the ranks of the founding meritorious officials did not include him, and so the name of Xincheng has faded into obscurity to this day. What a pity!

It is further said: That Emperor Zhaolie of Han could not unify the realm was only to be expected. "If an army marches without just cause, its affairs will not succeed; make clear that they are rebels, and the enemy may then be subdued." This is a matter of eternal strategy, a pivotal moment for all under Heaven. Xiang Yu and Cao Cao were comparable in power, one preceding the other, while Liu Bang and Liu Bei were both outmatched at the time. Yet Bang could brand Xiang Yu a traitor, while Bei could not publicly condemn Cao’s crimes—why? The righteousness between ruler and successor is of equal weight. When Cao murdered Empress Fu, had Bei truly been able to uphold great righteousness—issuing proclamations to the realm, holding a funeral, donning mourning garb, condemning Cao’s heinous crime, and declaring his punishment unforgivable—before raising troops to punish him, how few would have failed to respond, and how unlikely Cao would have been to escape unscathed! This was a path identical to that of his grandfather. Yet, unaware of this course, he conspired with Dong Cheng, relying on a secret edict hidden in the emperor’s robe, plotting Cao’s assassination. Alas! To call it "secret" is one thing, but how could such words befit one who rules over others? Thus, the Dong of the Three Kingdoms was clearly inferior to the Dong of Xincheng. Though Cheng himself is not worth reproach, at the time Fa Zheng was renowned for his strategic acumen, and Zhuge Liang for his understanding of grand principles—yet they failed to seize the moment. Merely denouncing Cao as a "traitor to Han" in a memorial at Sanguan Pass was of no avail. Only when Master Zhu later compiled the *Outline of the Comprehensive Mirror* and explicitly recorded the murder of the empress did the righteousness become clear. Was this not a regret for the ages!

From the *Book of Han*: Emperor Gao did not cultivate literature but was by nature perceptive, fond of planning, and able to heed advice. Even gatekeepers and soldiers treated him as an old friend. Initially, he aligned with the people’s will, establishing the Three Articles of Law. After pacifying the realm, he ordered Xiao He to codify statutes and decrees, Han Xin to refine military regulations, Zhang Cang to standardize administrative procedures, and Shusun Tong to devise rituals and ceremonies. He also divided tokens of investiture with his meritorious officials, inscribing iron charters in cinnabar, storing them in golden caskets and stone chambers within the ancestral temple. Though he claimed to have no leisure, his vision was vast and far-reaching.

The compiler notes: This "vast and far-reaching vision" was a lesson drawn from the successes and failures of Qin and Xin. For leniency in simplicity is the Way of Heaven. When Qin rose, its prohibitions were so dense they allowed no room; when Xin rose, its reforms were so hurried they seemed never-ending. Even to the point of weighing documents by the stone and setting quotas for paperwork, leaving no time for rest—this left no loopholes in governance, yet they did not realize that Heaven’s Way is not so rigidly constrained. Now, Heaven is vast—whether fine or coarse, high or low, it accommodates all without fail, yet never deviates from its principles. A ruler who models his governance on Heaven’s Way may grant or withhold, take or give, yet never transgress his measure. Qin abolished the feudal system, and Xin restricted land ownership, calculating to the last fraction—yet they did not foresee that collapse comes like tiles shattering or earth crumbling, not piece by piece. The Grand Historian also observed that continuity and adaptability prevent weariness, showing keen insight into human nature.

In the second year of Emperor Wen’s reign, an edict proclaimed: "When a ruler lacks virtue, Heaven sends disasters to warn of misrule. I, below, have failed to govern and nurture the people; above, I have burdened the brilliance of the Three Luminaries—my lack of virtue is great indeed. Let all reflect on my faults and what my knowledge and vision have failed to grasp, and report them to me in detail. Also, recommend those who are worthy, upright, and capable of forthright remonstrance to correct my shortcomings."

The compiler notes: This marked the beginning of forthright remonstrance. Thereupon, Jia Shan submitted a memorial titled *Utmost Words*. However, it was not recorded here, for while Shan’s words may be called forthright, they cannot be called "utmost." He drew analogies from Qin, believing it a warning, yet he did not realize that the Emperor revered Heaven, moved the people, cherished them, economized, broadened the paths for speech, honored modesty, curbed extravagance, and rejected tribute—these were his true intentions. Within months of his accession, it was already evident that the faults Shan cited were not the Emperor’s shortcomings. Why, then, did he persist in emphasizing the ruler’s awe-inspiring might, comparing it not only to thunder and lightning but to the weight of ten thousand jun? And why did he speak of the Zhou supporting eighteen hundred states while Qin received sustenance from eighteen hundred? At the time, the court ministers were still mired in Qin’s taboos. Upon seeing this, they blindly praised it as *Utmost Words*.

From my humble perspective, the Emperor’s shortcomings lay not in failing to attain the utmost good, but in contenting himself with the base and the near while neglecting the worthy and the sagely. This was no minor failing. As the *Tradition* says: *"In resting, know where to rest—can man be inferior to the birds?"* The implications for rousing the realm and all generations to come are most profound.

Deluded by the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s doctrine of purity and quiescence, he did not grasp that the noble man spares no effort in pursuing the ultimate. How, then, could one wonder at his taking pleasure in galloping, archery, and the hunt, or finding joy in striking down hares and felling the solitary? Had he but gained the company of men like Yi, Fu, Guan, or Shao, sitting with them to discourse on the Dao, I would have seen him revere them as divine, trust them as oracles—how could such cultivation flourish in a household yet falter in the imperial court?

All that he did was the work of a vulgar man, not the province of sages and worthies. Yet while the ruler sought worthies above, those below responded only with sycophants. How could Shan, no pure Confucian, be expected to comprehend the kingly Way?

Jia Yi memorialized: *"I privately consider the present governance—one matter calls for bitter weeping, two for flowing tears, and six for long sighs. As for other transgressions against principle and harm to the Dao, they are too numerous to list in full."* Yet those who offered counsel all claimed: *"The realm is at peace; it is already well-ordered."*

I alone hold that this is not so. Those who say the realm is at peace and well-ordered are either fools or flatterers—none truly grasp the essence of order and chaos. It is like one who embraces fire beneath a pile of kindling and sleeps atop it, calling it safe before the flames ignite. How is the present situation any different?

The Record states: *"In Emperor Wen’s time, there were two men named Jia. The Jia of Luoyang was no match for the Jia of Yingchuan."* Not only were his words urgently relevant to the moment, but his critique of Qin’s failures struck at the vital points of Han’s governance. Thus, I have recorded them in full.

Yet while governing a state relies on ritual propriety, his words lacked restraint—even Confucius would have smiled in disapproval. Having just ascended the grand court, he immediately spoke of bitter weeping, flowing tears, and long sighs—this was an unmeasured display, not a virtuous one.

To establish a stable state, one must first resolve the mutual suspicions between ruler and ministers. If the ministers frequently suffer calamity and the ruler is constantly beset by worries, this is no way to secure the throne or preserve the people. If one desires the realm’s peace and order, nothing is better than enfeoffing many lords while diminishing their power. With less power, they are easier to guide with righteousness; with smaller domains, they harbor no treacherous ambitions.

Now, the governance of the realm is like the body commanding the arm, the arm commanding the fingers—all submit without resistance. The lords of the feudal states dare not entertain disloyal thoughts; they converge like spokes to a hub, pledging allegiance to the Son of Heaven. Divide the lands and establish fixed boundaries, ordering Qi, Zhao, and Chu each to form several states, so that their descendants may inherit them in succession. Where lands are plentiful but heirs are few, establish new states and leave them vacant. When descendants are born, appoint them as rulers. Not an inch of land nor a single subject would the Son of Heaven seek to claim—this is done solely to secure order.

The Record states: *"Later, the proposals of Chao Cuo and Mainfu Yan both originated from this idea. The difference lay in Jingdi’s poor handling, which led to chaos, while Wudi’s adept use brought success—yet the core of the argument remained sound."*

Emperor Wen’s reign was a time when such measures could have been taken. The era of enfeoffment was not distant; the kings of the great states were either aged and senile or too young to be strong. The officials appointed by Han still held sway over affairs. Had he subtly divided the power of the Seven States and quietly stripped the feudal lords of their authority at that time, it would have required no great effort. To have missed this opportunity and later endured the toil of shattered axes and broken blades—was this the folly of youthful impracticality?

In the early days of Han’s founding, no hasty measure was as reckless as the system of enfeoffment.

*The Rites of Zhou* established the distinctions between major and minor lineages, between ancestral temples and branch shrines—where the main line of descent remained emperors for a hundred generations, collateral branches became feudal lords for a hundred generations, and cadet houses became grand officers for a hundred generations. Thus, the widespread enfeoffment of feudal lords was the natural order of things. How could it be that the sovereign himself remained a king, while his collateral kin became commoners; that the wealthy possessed fifty or seventy cities, while the poor had not even a foothold of land? This was not merely a matter of impractical power dynamics—it was also a violation of principle. Yet with all the Emperor’s wisdom, filial piety, and boundless love, he failed to examine its causes. Those who were fortunate enough to live in his time merely broached the subject without pursuing it to its conclusion, while Jiang and Guan further disparaged the idea. If even scholars of talent met with such misfortune, could this not be the will of Heaven? Could this not be the will of Heaven?

They asked the ruler to abandon ritual propriety and cast aside benevolence and grace, uniting all hearts in the pursuit of advancement. After two years of such governance, Qin declared it a failure. In old families, when sons grew strong, they were sent out to establish their own households; in poor families, when sons grew strong, they were sent out as live-in sons-in-law. Borrowing their father’s sacrificial vessels, they wore the air of virtue; their mothers took up dustpans and brooms, standing to berate them, while they cradled their own children, sitting as equals with their fathers. When mother and daughter-in-law could not please one another, they turned on each other with sharp tongues. Their love for their children and greed for profit differed little from beasts. Even now, the remnants of these customs remain unchanged—abandoning ritual propriety, competing in self-righteousness, with each month bringing new extremes and each year new excesses. In the worst cases, they even kill their fathers and brothers. Yet the great ministers treat only the failure to submit reports or meet deadlines as grave matters, while the corruption of customs and the ruin of the age pass unnoticed, accepted as if it were all inevitable.

To transform customs and turn the hearts of the world toward the Dao—this is not something petty officials can achieve. The concerns of petty officials lie in brushes and ledgers, unaware of the greater whole. And Your Majesty does not take it upon yourself to grieve. I can only lament this for Your Majesty.

A Record states: This is what I call the disease of the Middle Han, deep in the marrow and beyond cure.

Consider how the ancients used omens to distinguish good from evil and display them in their villages, how they employed bells to manifest virtue and suppress vice, establishing customs that inspired awe and admiration—was this because they delighted in such complexity? Truly, with the decadence of Shang customs lingering unchecked, even in times of repeated prosperity, they did not forget the harm of extravagance and excess. One saying declared: "The security or peril of the state rests upon these men of Yin." Another warned: "Arrogance, excess, and self-satisfaction will lead to a bad end." Yet the Duke of Zhou was vigilant at the beginning, Jun Chen harmonized the middle, and the Duke of Bi perfected the end. Only after three sages had governed a single region did they come to understand how difficult it is to transform customs and turn the hearts of the world toward the Dao.

The Han arose by force of arms and ruled by the power of the brush, inheriting from Qin a chaotic mix of hegemonic practices. In the worst cases, they were led astray by Huang-Lao teachings—how could they not suffer the pain of a life in turmoil? If they had possessed the resolve of Kings Cheng and Kang, seeking elders of virtuous power and diligent governance to support their rule, achieving success through non-action, they might still have feared that day and night would prove insufficient, that sitting idle would lead to irreparable loss. Yet they regarded such men as mere youths and novices—how could this not evoke deep sighs?

Master Guan said: "Ritual, propriety, integrity, and shame—these are called the Four Pillars. When the Four Pillars are not upheld, the state perishes." If Master Guan were a fool, one might dismiss him; but if he had even a slight grasp of governance, how could one not shudder? When Qin destroyed the Four Pillars and failed to uphold them, ruler and minister fell into chaos, the six relations suffered calamity, traitors arose in droves, and the people rebelled. In just thirteen years, the altars of state lay in ruins. Today, the Four Pillars remain incomplete, so traitors still find opportunity, and the people’s hearts waver in doubt. How can this compare to establishing fixed institutions, ensuring that ruler acts as ruler and minister as minister, with proper order between high and low; that father and son, the six relations, each fulfill their roles; that traitors find no opportunity, and the multitude of ministers and people trust without suspicion? If institutions are not fixed, it is like crossing a river without oars or moorings—caught in the current amid wind and waves, the boat will surely capsize. This is what calls for endless sighs.

A Record states: This is the urgent task of statecraft, a matter demanding deep reflection from all under heaven. Master Guan, whom even the Five Schools of Thought would be ashamed to cite, still understood that ritual, propriety, integrity, and shame are the Four Pillars of the state—how could the disciples of the great sages not know the path to a state’s destruction? The opportunism of traitors has been a constant since antiquity. Where favor and profit reside, where power and authority converge, men swarm like flies drawn to filth, like ants gathering without agreement—how much more so when the ruler’s call beckons? Thus, all boundaries of shame and moral restraint dissolve, and the most intelligent of creatures become no better than gnats or mosquitoes. The reason they ultimately perish is that what makes a state is its people, and what makes people is their hearts.

The sages of old valued sincerity in governance and prized concision in speech, aiming to guide the human heart firmly toward rectitude, to unify it clearly in oneness. Only then could the Dao flourish, politics be ordered, the people be nourished, and the barbarians of the four directions, with their collars left unfastened, all rely upon them. Without the Way of steadfast adherence and maintenance, the world would drift in confusion, not knowing where to turn. Human desires would run rampant, Heavenly principle would vanish, and the state’s ruin would be but a matter of time. This was the disaster that befell the Western Capital when its institutions collapsed, leading to the calamity of Wang Mang—and only then were Jia Yi’s warnings proven true. Was Master Guan truly a fool?

Ritual restrains before transgression occurs, while law punishes after the fact. Thus, the effects of law are easily seen, while the effects of ritual are difficult to perceive. Did the former kings refrain from using rewards to encourage virtue and punishments to deter evil? Yet they spoke of ritual because it is noble to extinguish evil before it sprouts and to cultivate teaching in its subtlest forms, so that the people daily move toward goodness without realizing it. For those who plan for the ruler, nothing is more important than first carefully examining what to accept and what to reject. When acceptance and rejection are firmly settled within, the sprouts of safety or peril will manifest without.

Tang and Wu broadly cultivated their virtue and conduct, and their dynasties endured for six or seven hundred years without faltering. The Qin ruler governed the world for little more than a decade before suffering total defeat. There was no other reason for this. Tang and Wu’s decisions on acceptance and rejection were judicious, while the Qin ruler’s were not. The world is a great vessel: place it in safety, and it is safe; place it in danger, and it is in peril. Tang and Wu placed the world upon benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music; the Qin ruler placed it upon laws, decrees, and punishments. This is plain for all to see—how could the outcome not be as clear as the difference between a great steed and a nag?

A Record states: Mencius said: "Is the arrow-maker less humane than the armor-maker? The arrow-maker fears only that he will not harm others, while the armor-maker fears only that he will." The shaman and the carpenter are the same. Thus, one cannot be too careful. This so-called "extension" refers precisely to acceptance and rejection. Tang and Wu placed the world upon benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music because they feared harming others. The Qin ruler placed it upon laws, decrees, and punishments because he feared not harming enough. In their origins, were they truly evil by nature? A deviation of a hair’s breadth leads to an error of a thousand miles. This is why those who govern must be urgently attentive to what they esteem.

Likes and dislikes take shape within, and only then are acceptance and rejection settled internally. The sage’s heart embraces all things yet remains unattached, his emotions accord with all things yet remain unmoved—truly because likes and dislikes cannot be indulged. If what he likes is biased toward one thing, the world rushes toward it in unison; if what he dislikes falls into partiality, the world suddenly turns against it.

The emperor was not unaware of the merits and flaws of benevolence, righteousness, laws, and decrees—only, deluded by other paths, he lacked the resolve to hold firm. His judgment was not without insight when he spoke thus. Had the emperor truly set aside his biases to reform institutions, goodness would have followed; to establish laws, compliance would have ensued. What was there to fear that he would not do? Yet yielding is a matter of conduct, while humility is a matter of the heart. If the heart does not lie in action, one sees only one’s own meddling.

In the first year of Emperor Wu’s reign, a decree summoned men of worth, uprightness, and forthright counsel. The emperor personally posed questions on governance past and present. Dong Zhongshu of Guangchuan responded: “I observe the awe-inspiring interplay between Heaven and man. Unless it is an age utterly devoid of the Dao, Heaven ever desires to uphold and secure all things—this lies in nothing but unrelenting effort. By striving diligently in learning, one’s knowledge broadens and insight sharpens; by striving diligently in practicing the Dao, virtue daily arises and great achievements follow. The Dao is the path on which all governance depends, and benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are its instruments. Thus, when sagely kings have passed, their descendants endure for generations, enjoying peace for hundreds of years—all through the power of ritual and music’s transformative teaching. The Zhou’s Dao declined under Kings You and Li, yet the Dao itself did not vanish; You and Li merely failed to adhere to it. When King Xuan later reflected on the virtue of the former kings, revived what had languished, and repaired what was broken, clarifying the achievements of Kings Wen and Wu, the Zhou’s Dao flourished once more. This was the result of unceasing diligence in practicing goodness.”

*Recorded:* This was the first of the *Heaven-and-Man* memorials. His call to “strive unrelentingly” aligns with the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s teaching on gradual progress leading even lesser men to greatness. Since the Han, few scholars have grasped this—yet Dong, lowering his curtain to study with single-minded devotion, gained much from such striving. Thus, in the grand court examination, he placed this at the forefront of his response, unlike later generations who merely cobbled together hackneyed phrases with no bearing on reality. Yet the emperor, endowed by Heaven with a bold and unrefined nature, sought only to surpass the ancients and outshine his contemporaries. How could he willingly submit to the humble task of striving in the practice of the Dao? Had Jia Yi or Dong Zhongshu encountered the civil and martial rulers of the Han, their exhortations to diligence might have found purchase with a yielding sovereign, while their own breadth of understanding would have suited a ruler of grand vision. Alas, Heaven does not bend to accommodate, and they were cast where they did not belong. Thus, for a hundred generations, men recite their words, long for their persons, discuss their era, and lament their lord—what sighs of regret!

For one who would be a true ruler: rectify the heart to rectify the court; rectify the court to rectify the officials; rectify the officials to rectify the common people; rectify the common people to rectify the four quarters. When the four quarters are rectified, near and far alike dare not stray from the upright, and no perverse *qi* or treachery can arise between them. Thus, yin and yang harmonize, wind and rain come in their seasons, all living things flourish, and the people multiply. All auspicious omens and blessings that can be summoned will arrive in full, and the kingly Way is complete.

Now Your Majesty, exalted as the Son of Heaven and enriched by the possession of the Four Seas, occupies a position where attainment is possible and wields power that can bring it about. Moreover, you possess the capacity to achieve it—your conduct is lofty, your kindness profound, your wisdom clear, your intentions noble, your love for the people sincere, and your regard for scholars earnest. You may be called a ruler of righteousness. Yet Heaven and Earth do not respond, and no felicitous signs appear—why? It is solely because transformative teaching has not been established, and the common people remain unrectified. The people’s pursuit of profit is like water flowing downward; without the embankment of transformative teaching, it cannot be halted. The kings of old understood this well. Thus, in ruling the world from their southern-facing throne, none failed to make transformative teaching their foremost duty. They established the Grand Academy to instruct the capital and set up local schools to civilize the towns. They gradually imbued the people with benevolence, polished them with righteousness, and regulated them with ritual. Thus, their punishments were light and prohibitions few, for transformative teaching was in effect and customs were refined.

*Recorded:* Since the Qin, the learning of the heart has nearly vanished. Zhongshu’s words were a true compass for the Han court. Yet alas, the ruler was driven by many desires, and his ministers, though offering counsel on rectifying the heart, were like one yoking oxen to the north while expecting the cart to go south—such was the blindness that went unheeded. In the Song dynasty’s *Longxing* era, Emperor Taizu came to understand this principle, saying: “Few ancient rulers could rectify their hearts to reach a state of flawlessness. I, day and night, stand in awe and fear, guarding against wrongdoing and restraining desires, hoping to fulfill the meaning of transforming the people through virtue.” Such a man could indeed be spoken to of rectifying the heart to rectify the court. And so, throughout the Song dynasty, yin and yang harmonized, wind and rain came in their seasons, all living things flourished, and the myriad beings thrived. Who can say that Zhongshu’s words were without effect?

I have heard that when sagely kings governed the world, they used ranks and emoluments to nurture virtue and punishments to deter evil. Thus, the people understood ritual and righteousness and felt shame in offending their superiors. King Wu practiced great righteousness, pacifying the cruel and violent, while the Duke of Zhou composed ritual and music to refine the age. By the flourishing reigns of Kings Cheng and Kang, the prisons were empty for over forty years—this, too, was the gradual effect of transformative teaching and the flow of benevolence and righteousness. Now Your Majesty rules all under Heaven, yet your achievements do not extend to the common people—this is likely because the kingly heart has not been applied. Master Zeng said: “Revere what you have heard, and you will attain loftiness; practice what you know, and you will achieve greatness.” Loftiness and greatness lie in nothing else but applying one’s intention. I hope Your Majesty will establish sincerity within and carry it into action—then how will you differ from the Three Kings?

*Recorded:* This was the second memorial. When the ruler of men, in his supreme dignity, deigns to inquire twice, his intent is clear. Zhongshu could not alter his argument, so he further emphasized revering what one has heard and practicing what one knows, making his words as distinct as black and white. How could they be confused with the likes of Du Qin or Gu Yong, who wielded their cunning and peddled their deceptive schemes? This is why his memory lingers, evoking admiration—not like those who merely gleaned fragments of stale rhetoric.

Yet if a single word suffices for understanding, why wait for a second inquiry before changing course?

The Dao is everlasting, without flaw through ten thousand generations. Flaws arise only from the loss of the Dao. The Xia esteemed loyalty, the Shang valued substance, and the Zhou honored refinement—each adapted to the needs of their succession. The great origin of the Dao issues from Heaven; as Heaven does not change, neither does the Dao. Thus, Yu succeeded Shun, Shun succeeded Yao, and the Three Sages transmitted and upheld one unchanging Way, free from the decay of governance. Therefore, they did not speak of what they had altered or added.

From this, we see: those who succeed a well-ordered age follow the same Dao, while those who succeed a disordered age must adapt their Way. Now, the Han has arisen after great chaos; it would be fitting to slightly reduce the refinement of the Zhou and govern with the loyalty of the Xia.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* upholds grand unification as the constant principle of Heaven and Earth, the shared norm of past and present. Yet today, masters teach divergent Ways, men hold conflicting doctrines, and the Hundred Schools offer disparate methods with differing aims—so that above, there is no means to maintain unity. I, in my foolishness, believe that all teachings not encompassed within the Six Arts or the scholarship of Confucius should have their Ways severed, not permitted to advance alongside. Only then can the system of governance be unified, laws be made clear, and the people know what to follow.

*Recorded:* This was the third memorial. What Zhongshu presented was the transmitted Way of Yao, Shun, and the Three Dynasties. What the Emperor favored were the words of power, defense, merit, profit, and literary ornamentation. Yet what the Chancellor memorialized to abolish were the doctrines of Shen [Buhai], Shang [Yang], Han Fei, Su Qin, and Zhang Yi. How could these three be more disparate than wind and horse or ox, utterly unrelated?

Moreover, if one wished to discard the Hundred Schools and exalt Confucius, why not adopt Zhongshu’s proposals? Diligently pursuing learning and practicing what one knows would distance the harm of heterodox and perverse teachings day by day, while the effects of loftiness and greatness would draw ever nearer.

Yet the Emperor spurned true scholars and kept them at a distance, while men like Zhuang Zhu, Sima Xiangru, Dongfang Shuo, and Mei Gao all stood at his side. Where, then, was his elevation of one and suppression of the other? From this, the Emperor’s conception of a "scholar" may be discerned.

At the time, the Emperor was summoning scholars from the Grand Academy, often saying, “I wish to...” But Ji An, a man of blunt nature and little courtesy, who would confront others to their faces and brook no tolerance for their faults, replied: “Your Majesty harbors many desires within yet outwardly practices benevolence and righteousness—how can you hope to emulate the governance of Tang and Yu?” The Emperor fell silent, his face darkening with anger, and dismissed the court. To his attendants, he said: “How excessive is Ji An’s insolence!”

At the time, all the high ministers feared for Ji An, and some even berated him. Ji An said: “The Son of Heaven appoints ministers of the Three Dukes to assist and correct him—should we merely flatter and comply with his wishes, leading the ruler into unrighteousness? Moreover, I occupy this position; even if I cherish my own life, how can I bear the disgrace to the court?”

*Recorded:* Emperor Wu could tolerate Ji An but not Yan Yi—because the bonds of fame and profit prevailed. Those who praise Tang and Yu or delight in the Yin and Zhou—how could they truly avoid forthright speech? Yet they do so not out of joy but necessity. Those who indulge in extravagance and excess or pursue every desire—how could they escape the need for levies and corvée? Yet they do so not through persuasion but coercion.

Thus, though the words of many desires may linger in the ruler’s heart, the reproach of retort truly harms his governance. This is why some were executed and others were not.

In the fourth year of the *Zhenghe* era, the Emperor issued an edict deeply lamenting his past regrets, saying: “There are those who have memorialized requesting distant military colonies at Luntai, intending to establish garrisons and outposts—this would disturb and weary the realm, not bring peace to the people. I cannot bear to hear of it. Henceforth, our efforts must lie in prohibiting harshness, halting unauthorized taxes, strengthening agriculture, and restoring the horse-rearing ordinances to fill shortages, ensuring our military preparedness does not falter—nothing more.”

Thereafter, he no longer dispatched armies, and enfeoffed Tian Qianqiu as Marquis of Enriching the People, to make clear his intent to rest and enrich the people.

*Recorded:* The edict of self-reproach at Luntai and the edict of self-reproach at Fengtian—are they the same?
It said: “They are not.”

The remorse of Emperor Wu arose from his innermost heart—what is called, "As the bird is about to die, its song is mournful; as the man is about to die, his words are kind." Thus was he able to wash clean the stains of old and embrace the transformation of renewal. The awakening of Emperor Dezong relied upon Lu Zhi—what is called, "The virtue of the noble man is like wind; the virtue of the petty man is like grass. When the wind blows over the grass, it must bend." Thus was he also able to turn chaos into order and peril into peace. Since ancient times, the movement of creatures and the resonance of sound have never stirred men so swiftly—truly so.

Wind and clouds, frost and dew—ever-changing and unpredictable; the eclipses of sun and moon—yet their brilliance cannot be obscured. How can later rulers afford to be heedless?

Emperor Xuan arose from the lanes and alleys, knowing the hardships of the people’s affairs. After Huo Guang’s death, he began to attend to governance himself, rousing himself to order, holding court every five days. From the Chancellor downward, each official presented his duties and memorials; he examined their words and tested their abilities. For the Attending Secretaries and Ministers whose merit warranted promotion, or who had exceptional virtue, he bestowed generous rewards, extending even to their descendants, never to be altered. The mechanisms of governance were meticulous, the standards and forms complete; above and below were at peace, with no room for carelessness.

*Recorded:* There were the sagely kings of Shang, who succeeded six or seven times because they had labored long in the field. There were the sovereigns of Zhou, Cheng and Kang, who so ably followed their predecessors because they knew the peril of ease. For the nature of ordinary men is such that without seeing what they desire, they cannot be moved to love; without seeing what they detest, they cannot be stirred to hate. Though Emperor Xuan was of lofty character and fond of learning, had he not arisen from the lanes and alleys, how could he have known the hardships of the people’s affairs, the successes and failures of official governance, and thus achieved a restoration rivaling the virtue of Shang and Zhou? This was not merely born of adversity and refined by Heaven’s favor—here, the will of Heaven is yet more manifest.

At the time, Bing Ji and Wei Xiang served together as Chancellors. Xiang was fond of studying past precedents, frequently compiling the expedient measures and policies of the Han dynasty since its founding, as well as the proposals of worthy ministers like Jia Yi, Chao Cuo, and Dong Zhongshu, and submitting them for implementation. He instructed officials to inspect affairs in the commanderies and kingdoms. Even when on leave from court, upon returning to the capital, he would report unusual news from the four quarters. If there were rebellions, unseasonable winds or rains, or disasters that the commanderies had not yet reported, he would memorialize them at once. Together with Bing Ji, he aided governance with one heart. Ji valued magnanimity, favored ritual propriety, and did not involve himself in minor matters. The people of the time considered him a man of great understanding, and they said of them: "When Gaozu laid the foundation, Xiao and Cao stood foremost; when Xiaoxuan revived the dynasty, Bing and Wei resounded with renown." Later Chancellors could not match them.

*Recorded:* After Xiao He and Cao Shen, the Chancellors appointed by the Han were mostly old generals or meritorious officials. These men of arms could not read literature or recite the classics, while those like Gongsun Hong, who came after, merely curried favor with their learning. Only Wei Xiang rose from the ranks of the worthy and virtuous, known for his stern integrity. Meeting with Emperor Xuan’s reign, he was able to remove the secondary marquisates, remonstrate against military campaigns, reclaim the power of the Huo clan, and curb the excesses of the imperial house. Had men like Jia Yi and Dong Zhongshu encountered such an opportunity, would they have failed the Han? Alas! "If I am not at ease, how can I expect my descendants to follow my example?" Thus the noble man grieves that his words are not established, not that his virtue has no peer. This is not only the renown of Bing and Wei—it is also the vindication of Jia and Dong.

The emperor, seeing the submission of the Rong and Di barbarians, thought of the excellence of his ministers, and so had their likenesses painted in the Unicorn Pavilion, depicting their forms, and inscribing their ranks, names, and titles. Only Huo Guang was not named, but recorded as "Grand Commandant, Grand General, Marquis of Boling, of the Huo clan." Following him were Zhang Anshi, Han Zeng, Zhao Chongguo, Wei Xiang, Bing Ji, Du Yannian, Liu De, Liangqiu He, Xiao Wangzhi, and Su Wu—eleven men in all—each renowned in their time for merit and virtue. Thus were they honored and exalted, their restoration of the dynasty made manifest, ranked alongside Fang Shu, Shao Hu, and Zhong Shanfu.

*Recorded:* In the order of the Unicorn Pavilion, precedence was given to those who had aided the emperor’s accession. Yet the purpose of these portraits was to reflect the submission of the four barbarians and to honor the excellence of the emperor’s ministers—it did not prioritize Su Wu’s steadfast integrity. If the intent were to display the abundance of China’s talent, then in Emperor Wu’s time, though he exhausted his heart and mind, often seeking "horses that outrun their teams" and "men who gallop ahead," his efforts to employ extraordinary envoys for distant missions were extreme. Yet Li Ling and Wei Lü defected in droves, and among them, only Ziqing held fast for nineteen years without wavering—truly a lament for the decline of China’s talent. Had Wu returned in Emperor Shizong’s reign, he would surely have been elevated to an exceptional rank. Alas, the white silk of his memorials came too late, and his black hair turned early. This was Wu’s misfortune, not the Han’s wise strategy—how much more so when the Xiongnu were still unruly? The arguments of examination candidates, for the most part, are not the words of those who have attained the Way and cannot serve as instruction.

Emperor Cheng, when still Crown Prince, indulged in wine and revelry. When the Prince of Zhongshan, Ai, died, the Crown Prince paid his respects without sorrow, greatly displeasing Emperor Yuan. Only when the Attached Cavalry Commander, Shi Dan, removed his cap in apology did the emperor’s anger subside. As Emperor Yuan lay gravely ill, he repeatedly questioned the Secretariat about the precedent of Emperor Jing’s establishment of the Prince of Jiaodong. Shi Dan, as an intimate minister, was able to attend the emperor during his illness. Waiting until the emperor was alone, he entered the bedchamber, prostrated himself upon the green rush mats, and wept as he said: "The Crown Prince, as the eldest legitimate heir, has been established for over ten years. His name and title are bound to the people, and all under Heaven turn their hearts to him. Yet now, rumors spread through the streets, suggesting that the Crown Prince’s position is in question."

Should this be the case, the ministers and officials from the Three Dukes downward would surely resist to the death and refuse to obey the edict. I beg to be put to death first as an example to the assembled ministers." Moved by these words, the emperor’s resolve wavered, and he said to Dan: "My illness grows ever worse, and I can no longer recover. You must assist the Crown Prince well and not defy my wishes." Dan, sighing deeply, rose to his feet, and thus the Crown Prince’s position was secured until his accession.

During the Yuanyan era, the former magistrate of Huaili, Wei Yun, submitted a memorial requesting an audience. In the presence of the assembled ministers, Yun declared: "The great officials of the present court are all mere placeholders, consuming salary without merit. I beg to be granted the executioner’s sword from the Imperial Armory to sever the head of one sycophantic minister, that the rest may be admonished." The emperor demanded: "Who is it?" Yun replied: "The Marquis of Anchang, Zhang Yu." Enraged, the emperor declared: "A petty official dares to slander his superiors and humiliate his teacher in open court—his crime is death, and he shall not be pardoned." The imperial censors seized Yun and dragged him away. Clinging to the palace railing, Yun broke it as he was pulled down, crying: "To descend and join Long Feng and Bi Gan in the underworld would be enough for me!" The censors then hauled Yun away. Thereupon, the Left General Xin Qingji removed his cap, kowtowed at the foot of the dais, and pleaded: "This minister has long known Yun to be recklessly forthright. If his words are correct, they cannot be punished; if they are false, they should be tolerated for his past conduct." The emperor’s anger subsided. Later, when the railing was to be repaired, the emperor said: "Do not replace it."

Thus was it compiled, to honor the upright minister.

The record states: Shi Dan’s prostration upon the green rushes and Zhu Yun’s breaking of the palace railing—both were celebrated events of their time, yet it remains unclear which course truly yielded gain or loss. The disasters of the Han dynasty began with Emperor Cheng, and the Wang clan’s usurpation was consummated by Zhang Yu. Had it not been for Shi Dan’s seasoned judgment, the indecisive sovereign might well have been replaced, and whether the Han would have remained the Han is uncertain. Had Zhu Yun’s words been heeded, the head of the treacherous minister would have been struck off, and whether the Wang would have become the Wang is likewise uncertain. Alas! Dan acted with seasoned conduct, while Yun shattered the railing. The former’s course was one with which one could stand firm, though not one with which one could weigh shifting circumstances. The latter’s act was persuasive yet lacked thorough deliberation, followed yet left unamended—herein lies the division between gain and loss.

From the *Later Han History*:
Deng Yu of Nanyang, staff in hand, pursued Emperor Guangwu to Ye. Guangwu said: “I now hold sole authority over enfeoffments. Having come from afar, do you seek office?” Yu replied: “I do not.” He continued: “I only wish that your illustrious virtue and power extend to the four seas, and that I may contribute my modest efforts, leaving my name recorded upon bamboo and silk.” Guangwu laughed and detained him for the night. Yu then offered counsel, saying: “Now the land east of the mountains remains unsettled. The Red Eyebrows and Green Calves number in the tens of thousands. Gengshi, though mediocre, does not heed wise counsel, while his generals are all common men. Their ambitions lie in wealth and coin, their methods in brute force, seeking only momentary gratification. None possess loyalty, wisdom, deep foresight, or long-term planning to honor their lord and pacify the people. Your Excellency, by contrast, has long been renowned for your great virtue and merit, revered throughout the realm. Your military governance is solemn and strict, your rewards and punishments clear and trustworthy.”

For the present strategy, nothing is better than to summon heroes far and wide, strive to please the people’s hearts, establish a lofty and enduring enterprise, and save the lives of the myriad people. If you, my lord, take the realm into consideration, its pacification will not be difficult.

Guangwu was greatly pleased.

The record states: Who does not wish to leave their name and achievements upon bamboo and silk? When drought becomes a disaster, the divine dragon is trapped in the shallows; when nets and snares are not removed, the auspicious qilin suffers calamity. Had Wenshu not risen, Nanyang would remain a wilderness of weeds—how then could one offer even the slightest contribution? Now, observing Deng Yu, though he has just reached the age of twenty, he already comprehends grand strategy, aspiring directly to establish the enterprise of Gaozu and save the lives of the myriad people—far beyond what an ordinary man could achieve. Moreover, his words on the depth of virtue subtly align with the principle that the benevolent are invincible. Thus, his coming from afar—was it truly to seek office? It further confirms that when the dragon rises, clouds follow; when the qilin arrives, auspicious omens respond. Is it not fitting that he should be counted among the foremost meritorious officials?

The Red Eyebrows wrought havoc, and the great clans of the Three Auxiliaries’ commanderies and counties each hoarded troops. Guangwu then dispatched the Deputy General Feng Yi to suppress them. The imperial carriage escorted him to Henan, where Guangwu instructed Feng Yi: “The Three Auxiliaries have suffered the chaos of Wang Mang and Gengshi, compounded by the cruelty of the Red Eyebrows and Cen Peng. The common people are mired in suffering, with nowhere to turn for redress. General, as you now carry out the imperial mandate to subdue the lawless strongholds, send those who surrender with their chieftains to the capital. Disperse the common folk to return to farming and sericulture, and dismantle their fortifications to prevent them from regrouping. Conquest does not necessarily require seizing land or massacring cities; what matters is pacification and restoration. The generals are not lacking in martial prowess, yet they are fond of seizing spoils and plundering. They must be restrained from such conduct. The officers and soldiers should be mindful of self-discipline, so as not to be viewed with suspicion by the commanderies and counties.”

Feng Yi bowed deeply, received the command, and marched west. Wherever he went, he displayed authority and trustworthiness, and many bandits surrendered.

The record states: The Emperor’s instructions to Feng Yi did not merely issue warnings. Deng Yu’s grand vision, singularly focused on pacification and restoration, reveals the heart of one who would be a parent to the people. For benevolence cannot be matched by violence, and Feng Yi and Deng Yu were of one mind. Deng Yu’s timely intervention corrected the excesses of the age. That such a course was both necessary and true to principle is precisely what a ruler should esteem. By contrast, the Northern Song court, through men like Wang Anshi, Tong Dun, and Cai Bian, brought about chaos, while the restoration under Gaozong later entrusted power to Huang Qianshan, Wang Boyan, and Qin Hui without reproach—like ill-omened birds taking flight, nothing could be done. In such cases, no blame can be assigned.

In the third year of Yongping during the reign of Emperor Ming of the Han, the Emperor, reflecting upon the meritorious officials of the Restoration, had portraits of the twenty-eight generals painted in the Yun Terrace of the Southern Palace. Deng Yu was placed first, followed by Ma Cheng, Wu Han, Wang Liang, Jia Fu, Chen Jun, Geng Yi, Du Mao, Kou Xun, Chuan Jun, Cen Peng, Jian Tan, Feng Yi, Wang Ba, Zhu You, Ren Guang, Ji Zun, Li Zhong, Jing Dan, Wan Xiu, Gai Yan, Xing Tong, Yao Qi, Liu Zhi, Geng Chun, Zang Gong, Ma Wu, and Liu Long. Additionally, Wang Chang, Li Tong, Dou Rong, and Zhuo Mao were included, making thirty-two in total. Notably absent were those related to the imperial consort.

It is recorded: In my humble observation, the strategies and bearing of the Yun Terrace generals seem not to match those of the founding heroes of the Western Han, yet they achieved fame that eclipsed their age. Why is this? For Gaozu excelled at commanding generals, while Guangwu excelled at commanding troops. Those of magnanimous vision and great capacity embody the essence of leading generals; those of keen talent, courage, and strategic acumen embody the foundation of leading soldiers. Thus, though the battle array at the Backwater was beyond Gaozu’s comprehension, the victory at Kunyang was Guangwu’s to claim. Zhang Liang alone could devise the stratagem of borrowing arrows, yet Guangwu’s "rice-map" planning was already clear in his mind’s eye. Had Gaozu encountered such circumstances, Kou [Xun] and Deng [Yu] would not have swiftly reaped the fruits of victory in their twilight years. Had Guangwu been at the helm, Han [Xin] and Peng [Yue] might not have achieved the triumph at Gaixia. The generals of these two Han dynasties, each encountering their time and sovereign in different ways, nonetheless achieved the same success.

*Hongdao Record, Volume Thirteen, concludes*
*Hongdao Record, Volume Fourteen, "Righteousness"*

The Righteousness of Ruler and Minister

In Zhuge Liang’s *Memorial on Dispatching the Army*, he states: "The late Emperor’s enterprise was not yet half-completed when he passed midway, and now the realm is divided into three, with Yizhou exhausted—this is truly a critical moment of survival or extinction. Yet the ministers who attend and guard within do not slacken, and the loyal and devoted officers who risk their lives without regard abroad do so because they cherish the late Emperor’s extraordinary favor and wish to repay it to Your Majesty. It is truly fitting to broaden the scope of sagely hearing, to illuminate the late Emperor’s bequeathed virtue, and to invigorate the spirit of the aspiring officers. One should not recklessly belittle oneself, draw improper analogies, or obstruct the path of loyal remonstrance. The palace and the court are one body; rewards and punishments, praise and censure should not differ. If there are those who commit treachery or violate the law, or those who act with loyalty and goodness, they should be handed over to the responsible officials to deliberate their punishment or reward, thereby manifesting Your Majesty’s impartial and enlightened governance. Partiality should not be shown, lest the laws within and without diverge.

Attendants Guo Youzhi, Fei Wei, and Dong Yun—these are all men of integrity, whose aspirations and thoughts are loyal and pure. The late Emperor selected and promoted them to bequeath them to Your Majesty. I believe that for matters within the palace, all should be consulted with them, for they will surely remedy omissions and oversights, yielding great benefit. General Xiang Chong is virtuous and impartial in conduct, well-versed in military affairs. The late Emperor praised his ability, and the consensus appointed him as commander. I believe that for matters within the camp, all should be consulted with him, for he will surely harmonize the ranks and ensure that the capable and the less capable are each properly placed.

To draw near worthy ministers and distance petty men—this is how the Former Han flourished. To draw near petty men and distance worthy scholars—this is how the Later Han declined. I, your minister, was originally a commoner, tilling the soil in Nanyang, seeking only to preserve my life in a chaotic age, not aspiring to fame among the feudal lords. The late Emperor did not regard my lowliness and baseness, but humbly condescended to visit me thrice in my thatched cottage, consulting me on the affairs of the age. Moved by this, I pledged myself to his service. Later, when defeat befell us, I received my commission amid the ruins of the army and carried out my mission in times of peril—twenty-one years have passed since then. The late Emperor knew my prudence, and so on his deathbed entrusted me with the great task. Since receiving this command, I have labored day and night in anxiety, fearing that the trust would not be fulfilled and that the late Emperor’s wisdom would be impugned. Thus, in the fifth month, I crossed the Lu River and ventured deep into barren lands. Now the southern lands are pacified, and our arms are sufficient; it is time to rally and lead the three armies to conquer the Central Plains.

This is how I repay the late Emperor and fulfill my duty to Your Majesty. As for weighing gains and losses and offering loyal counsel to the utmost, that is the responsibility of Youzhi, Wei, and Yun. I hope Your Majesty will entrust me with the task of punishing the rebels and reviving the dynasty. If I fail, then punish my crime. Your Majesty should also deliberate for yourself, seeking and heeding wise counsel, scrutinizing and accepting refined advice, and pursuing the late Emperor’s final decrees. Now, as I part from you, tears wet this memorial, and I know not what I have said."

The *Record* states: How rare and steadfast was Liang’s loyalty! When one can be assisted, one assists; when one cannot, one withdraws. This was the command of Emperor Zhaolie on his deathbed, yet Liang could not but sacrifice himself for the times. To cherish the late Emperor’s extraordinary favor and desire to repay it to Your Majesty—this was Marquis Wu’s unparalleled insight, resolutely dedicating himself to righteousness. Preceding him were men like Dong [Zhuo], Yuan [Shu], Cao [Cao], and Sima [Yi], yet he left behind these two memorials as his personal vows. It is like the clash of deviant and upright arrows, from which a brilliant star emerges in their wake, or the surge of obstinate and venomous forces, against which the sun and moon shine forth in radiant clarity.

When he said, "The palace and the court are one body," it was not merely the language of family and kin, but truly a matter of life and death for the Latter Lord. When he said, "Draw near worthy ministers and distance petty men," it was not merely a pressing concern of recent warning, but truly the origin of order and chaos for all ages. When he said, "Your Majesty should also deliberate for yourself, seeking and heeding wise counsel, scrutinizing and accepting refined advice," it was not merely the hope of a vital plan in his lifetime, but truly the ultimate fate of the Han enterprise after his death. Thus it is said: Kongming was a figure of the Three Dynasties; Guan Zhong and Yue Yi are not worth discussing.

In the *Second Memorial on Dispatching the Army*, he states: "The late Emperor deeply considered that the Han and the rebels could not coexist, and that the royal enterprise could not be content with partial security, so he entrusted me with the task of punishing the rebels. Given the late Emperor’s discernment and my own meager talent, he knew well that my strength was insufficient to overcome the enemy. Yet if the rebels were not punished, the royal enterprise would still perish. To sit and await destruction—how is that better than taking action? Thus he entrusted me without hesitation.

Since receiving this command, I have not rested easy, nor found savor in my food. It is not that I do not value myself, but that the royal enterprise cannot be content with partial security in the capital of Shu. Thus I brave peril and hardship to fulfill the late Emperor’s bequeathed intent, though critics call this unwise. Now the enemy is weary in the west and occupied in the east—military strategy dictates seizing the moment when the enemy is exhausted. This is the time to advance. Emperor Gao’s brilliance rivaled the sun and moon, and his strategists were profound, yet he endured hardship and danger before achieving security. Your Majesty does not yet match Emperor Gao, nor do your strategists equal Zhang [Liang] and Chen [Ping], yet you seek to secure the realm with long-term plans and a passive strategy—this is something I do not understand.

Since I arrived in Hanzhong, barely a year has passed, yet we have lost Zhao Yun, Yang Qun, and others—all elite warriors gathered from the four corners over decades, not confined to one province. If several more years pass, what will we use to contend with the enemy? Now the people are impoverished and the troops exhausted, yet the task cannot cease. If it cannot cease, then whether we remain or advance, the toll in labor and expense will be the same."

Yet have you not considered planning with emptiness in mind? For the most difficult to pacify is the course of events.

Long ago, the late Emperor suffered defeat in Chu. At that time, Cao Cao clapped his hands, declaring the realm already settled. Yet afterward, the late Emperor forged alliances with Wu and Yue, took Ba and Shu in the west, raised troops for a northern campaign, and beheaded Xiahou. This was Cao Cao’s miscalculation, and the Han cause nearly succeeded. Then Wu broke its covenant, Guan Yu met ruin, setbacks followed at Zigui, and Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor. Affairs unfold thus—hard to foresee in reverse.

I shall exert myself to the utmost, until death. As for success or failure, advantage or dullness, these lie beyond the foresight of my limited wisdom.

*Recorded:* Zhuge Liang deemed Cao Cao’s generalship equal to Sun and Wu, yet in these two memorials he proposed no extraordinary schemes or secret strategies—only the military principle of striking the weary as his present plan. Could Liang truly have failed to consider other options? Yet without the self-effacing humility of Tang of old, how could the campaign at Mingtiao have been launched? Without the unwavering resolve of King Wu, how could the valor of Mengjin have been displayed? With Liu Shan as sovereign and Liang as his minister, with Sun Quan as foe and Sima Yi as subject—it is as if one sought to lift a burden by gazing upward like Yao, or to herd sheep by entrusting them to wolves. How could this be governance?

Yet the Han and the usurpers cannot both stand; the royal enterprise cannot endure in partial retreat. The grand righteousness must resound throughout the realm. Thus he declared first: "I shall rouse and lead the Three Armies, pacify the Central Plains, restore the Han, and return to the old capital." And second: "I shall not rest easy in my seat nor savor my food, but devote myself wholly until death." Liang’s heart knew its own impotence. Yet his forthrightness and integrity stand apart from those who fawn and scurry in hope of luck.

Tang Zhang Yungu’s *Admonition on the Great Treasure* says:

From ancient times to the present, gazing below and above, only the sovereign bestows fortune—truly, to be a ruler is difficult. Presiding over all beneath heaven, enthroned above princes and dukes, receiving tribute from the lands and counsel from the assembled officials—thus the heart of fear slackens, and the passions of perversity grow unchecked. How could one know that affairs arise from what is overlooked, and calamity from what is unanticipated?

Thus the sage receives the Mandate, rescues the drowning, relieves distress, takes blame upon himself, and aligns his heart with the people. The great brightness shines without partiality; the utmost impartiality admits no private favor. Therefore, with one man he governs the world, not with the world he serves one man. Ritual curbs excess; music prevents dissipation.

Do not say, "No one knows"—from on high, he hears the lowly. Do not say, "What harm?"—small accumulations become great. Joy must not reach its limit, for at its height sorrow is born. Desire must not be indulged, for indulgence breeds disaster.

Though he dwells within ninefold gates, his chambers need not exceed what shelters his knees. Yet the deluded adorn their towers with jade and their halls with gems. Though eight delicacies are arrayed before him, his meal need not surpass what satisfies his palate. Yet the mad dream of heaping their dregs into hills and pooling their wine into lakes.

Do not let lust within lead you astray; do not let hunting without lead you astray. Do not prize rare goods; do not heed the music of fallen states. Punish only after all abandon a man; reward only after all delight in him. Weaken the strong and govern the chaotic; extend the bent and redress the wronged.

Thus it is said: Like the balance and the stone, do not weigh things with partiality—what hangs will reveal its true weight. Like water and the mirror, do not show things your bias—what is reflected will reveal its true nature. Do not be turbid, for turbidity muddies; do not be too pure, for purity exposes. Do not be obscure, for obscurity confounds; do not be too keen, for keenness blinds.

Though the crown’s tassels veil your eyes, see what has no form. Though the earplugs block your ears, hear what has no sound. Let your mind roam in the realm of clarity; let your spirit wander in the essence of the supreme Dao. Those who know it respond to the vast and the minute like an echo; those who draw from it fill themselves whether they take little or much.

Thus it is said: Heaven’s constancy, earth’s tranquility, the king’s steadfastness—though the four seasons do not speak, they alternate in order; though the myriad things do not speak, they are transformed and completed. How could one know the emperor’s power and yet the world be at peace?

Our king overthrew disorder with wisdom and force; the people feared his might but did not yet cherish his virtue. Our sovereign governs with pure wind; the people embrace his beginning but do not yet secure his end. Therefore, I set forth this golden mirror, exhausting the divine and perfecting the sagely, so that men may respond with their hearts to its words, and their conduct encompass the principles of governance. Its phrases rise and fall, its admonitions take shape.

The world is held in common; if one man has cause for celebration, the net of blessings unfolds, the zither is strummed, and poems are composed. Day after day, this remains ever in mind. What men summon, Heaven aids. With upright ministers to oversee integrity, I dare to present these doubts before you.

The Record states: Since the Han, China passed through six dynasties, and the North and South endured the two Jin. Yet to the rulers and ministers of Sui, great righteousness was as fleeting as gourds cast aside, and for long had upright ministers who oversaw integrity fallen silent, their remonstrations erased.

Then the Tang arose like a dragon, parting the heavens and raising the sun. Only then did rulers begin to grasp the difficulty of governance, and the precious admonition of the *Great Treasure* once more found voice—truly a rare thing.

Yet though Yan and Yun served the same sovereign in ancient times, one was praised for flattery, the other censured for forthright reproof. Though their rewards and punishments were alike in the moment, later their fates diverged under the weight of power and punishment. This reveals the difficulty of perfect impartiality and the ideal of "the world held in common," making it nearly impossible for men to respond with their hearts to its words and embody its principles in conduct.

From the *Comprehensive Mirror*: Taizong grew ever closer to Wei Zheng. Zheng, feeling his favor unparalleled in an age, laid bare his deepest thoughts in over two hundred memorials, each piercing and perfectly aligned with the emperor’s will. When someone accused Zheng of favoring his relatives, the emperor sent Wen Yanbo to investigate, but no wrongdoing was found. Yanbo said to the emperor: "Zheng does not maintain appearances or avoid suspicion. Though his heart is free of bias, he is still open to reproach." The emperor rebuked Zheng, saying: "From now on, you must maintain appearances and stay close."

Later, Zheng entered court and said: "I have heard that when ruler and minister share one heart, they become as one body and should deal with one another in utmost sincerity. If above and below merely maintain appearances and stay close, the rise or fall of the state remains uncertain." He dared not accept the decree. The emperor, moved, said: "I already regret it."

Zheng bowed twice and said: "I am fortunate to serve Your Majesty. I hope you will let me be a *good* minister, not a *loyal* one." The emperor asked: "Is there a difference between loyalty and goodness?" Zheng replied: "Hou Ji, Xie, and Gao Yao—ministers who harmonized with their rulers—all enjoyed honor and glory. These were *good* ministers. Long Feng and Bi Gan, who remonstrated to their deaths and brought ruin to themselves and their states, were *loyal* ministers." The emperor was pleased.

The Record states: The learning of Duke Wei originated from the masters of He and Fen...

Yet his words touch nothing of the self or the heart—why is this? Were Hou Ji, Xie, and Gao Yao merely ministers who harmonized with their rulers and enjoyed honor and glory? Above, they ensured fathers acted as fathers and sons as sons; below, elder brothers as elder brothers and younger brothers as younger brothers; within, husbands as husbands and wives as wives—none failed to find their proper place. Thus they secured enduring honor and glory, unwaning through the ages. In the reign of Taizong, father and son transgressed their proper roles, brothers violated their order, and husbands and wives confounded ethics. Only in matters of reward and punishment, promotion and demotion, the establishment of statutes and decrees did his innate brilliance and acuity prevent disorder. Thus Wei Zheng could admonish and Li Shuli could debate. This was precisely what Zhang Yungu meant by "the people fear his might but do not cherish his virtue." How could it compare to the Three Dynasties of Yao, Shun, and Yu? As for the so-called Way of loyalty and goodness, it was but a hollow name between ruler and minister. Those who observe must discern its truth.

Wei Zheng memorialized the throne, saying: "Many rulers begin well, but few end well. Is it because seizing power is easy while preserving it is hard? When deeply troubled, one exhausts sincerity to serve those below; in ease and comfort, one grows arrogant and scorns others. Serving those below unites even distant lands in shared purpose; scorning others severs the bonds of the six relations. Though one may shake them with threats and wrath, they will only feign obedience while their hearts remain unyielding. If Your Majesty can, upon seeing what is desirable, think of knowing contentment; when about to embark on construction, think of knowing restraint; when in high and perilous station, think of humility and deference; when facing fullness and abundance, think of moderation; when encountering pleasure and ease, think of temperance; when in comfort and security, think of future peril; when guarding against obstruction, think of extending welcome; when detesting slander and deceit, think of rectifying one’s own conduct; when bestowing ranks, think of the excess that may come with joy; when imposing punishments, think of the excess that may come with anger—if you embrace these ten reflections and select the worthy to employ the capable, you may govern effortlessly. Why then exhaust mind and body to take on the burdens of the people?"

The Record states: Zheng’s counsel was excellent, yet it failed to reach the root of sagely achievement. The office of the heart is to reflect—how could reflection be limited to ten? Can the myriad affairs of a single day be confined to a fixed number? Only by guarding it in the unseen and unheard, in solitude and secrecy, with unwavering constancy and tranquil persistence, can one attain the One. With the One, there is no beginning; without beginning, things cannot intrude. In stillness, there is no disturbance; without disturbance, the heart remains steadfast. Though the ruler may deliberate a thousand times, what need has he for ten?

For the eyes and ears perceive what is desirable, but it is the heart’s office to reflect on contentment. Once one sees what is desirable, one has already engaged with things. When things interact with things, and only then does one apply reflection—how few can avoid being led astray? Thus the ancients found it easier to discipline the heart than to achieve the effects of Zheng’s ten reflections.

Zheng said: "I serve at Your Majesty’s side and You have permitted me to uphold the Way of benevolence and righteousness without fail, to remain frugal and unadorned from beginning to end. Yet in recent years, You have not sustained this. In the early years of the Zhenguan era, You were serene and sparing in desire, and Your transformative influence reached beyond the borders. Now You dispatch envoys thousands of miles to seek fine horses and rare curios—this is the first decline. In the early Zhenguan era, You guarded the people’s toil as if they were Your children and did not lightly expend their labor. Recently, You have grown extravagant and reckless, demanding their strength—this is the second decline. In the early Zhenguan era, You labored for the benefit of others; lately, You indulge Your desires at the people’s expense. Though Your lips speak ceaselessly of concern for the people, Your heart clings to the pleasures of the self—this is the third decline. In the early Zhenguan era, You drew near to the noble and distanced the base; lately, You honor the noble yet keep them at a remove, while growing intimate with the base—this is the fourth decline. In the early Zhenguan era, You did not prize exotic goods or undertake useless projects; now rare and precious items pour in together, and the crafting of playthings never ceases—this is the fifth decline. In the early Zhenguan era, You sought scholars as if parched, valuing their strengths and fearing You might miss them; lately, Your likes and dislikes dictate their rise and fall, advancing the many worthy on one man’s praise and discarding them on one man’s slander—this is the sixth decline. In the early Zhenguan era, You dwelled in lofty tranquility, without the pleasures of hunting and archery; after several years, Your resolve could not hold, and tribute of hawks and hounds came from the distant four quarters. You ride out at dawn and return at dusk, finding joy in the chase—this is the seventh decline. In the early Zhenguan era, You treated those below with courtesy, and the sentiments of the people reached You; now when officials from beyond the court submit memorials, You do not deign to meet their gaze, interrogating them for their faults and nitpicking their minor errors. Though they harbor loyal devotion, it cannot be expressed—this is the eighth decline. In the early Zhenguan era, You diligently pursued the Way as if never satisfied; lately, You rely on the greatness of Your achievements, the brilliance of Your sagacity, growing proud and indulging Your desires, launching military campaigns in distant lands without cause—this is the ninth decline. In the early Zhenguan era, after years of frost and drought, the people of the capital fled beyond the passes, carrying the old and leading the young, yet none abandoned their homes; lately, exhausted by corvée labor, the people of Guanzhong suffer most acutely—this is the tenth decline.

Disaster and fortune have no fixed gate; they are summoned by men. A thousand years of prosperous rule are difficult to regain once lost. That a wise ruler could act but does not—this is why I am choked with sorrow and sigh without end."

The memorial was submitted. The emperor said: "I have heard my faults."

The memorial was inscribed upon screens and curtains, and a copy was also submitted to the historiographers, that all ages might know the righteousness between ruler and minister.

It was recorded: What is meant by "at first, reverence overcomes laxity"? Virtue overcomes desire. What is meant by "gradually, laxity overcomes reverence"? Desire overcomes virtue. In their beginnings, how did King Wu of Zhou and Emperor Taizong of Tang differ? Yet in the end, they diverged—this was the result of gradual decline. Though Wei Zheng’s admonitions struck precisely at the ailments of rulers through the ages, the emperor, having ordered the memorial recorded by the historiographers to illuminate the great righteousness between ruler and minister, soon thereafter violated it, mourning it only as a screen beside his seat—no different from the past when gold was used to shelter horses, inviting ridicule in later days. Thus, not only did gradual decline prove unconquerable, but in the end, he even entirely forgot his original resolve.

The emperor, reflecting on the meritorious service of his founding ministers, commanded artisans to paint the portraits of Duke Zhao, Changsun Wuji; Prince Yuan of Zhao Commandery, Li Xiaogong; Duke Cheng, Du Ruhui; Duke Wenzhen of Zheng, Wei Zheng; Duke Liang, Fang Xuanling; Duke Shen, Gao Shilian; Duke E, Yuchi Jingde; Duke Wei, Li Jing; Duke Song, Xiao Mafu; Duke Zhongsheng, Duan Zhixuan; Duke Kui, Liu Hongji; Duke Zhong, Qu Tu Tong; Duke Jie of Zheng, Yin Kaishan; Duke Xiang of Qiao, Chai Shao; Duke Xiang of Na, Changsun Shunde; Duke Zheng, Zhang Liang; Duke Chen, Hou Junji; Duke Xiang of Bang, Zhang Gongjin; Duke Lu, Cheng Zhijie; Duke Wenyi of Yongxing, Yu Shinan; Duke Xiang of Qiao, Liu Zhengzhui; Duke Ju, Tang Jian; Duke Ying, Li Shiji; and Duke Zhuang of Hu, Qin Shubao—twenty-four men in all—upon the Lingyan Pavilion.

It was recorded: The portraits in the Lingyan Pavilion were painted without including Pei Ji and Liu Wenzhen—why? Ji Bu was an enemy of Han, yet he was pardoned; Ding Gong was a benefactor of Han, yet he was executed. How could the discernment of a wise ruler differ in such matters? Thus, though Wang Gui and Wei Zheng were adversaries, their loyalty to their lord made them like dragons in harmony; Pei Ji and Liu Wenzhen, though favored, betrayed righteousness, and so their portraits became a disgrace. Observing this, how could one fail to know where to turn?

In the early years of Emperor Xuanzong’s reign, Yao Yuanzhong served as Minister of War and concurrent Grand Councilor. Yuanzhong, knowing the emperor’s magnanimity and eagerness to govern, first established precedents to strengthen the emperor’s resolve. He memorialized: "Since the *Chuigong* era, harsh laws have bound the people. I wish that governance might first embrace benevolence and forgiveness—would this be acceptable? The court has suffered defeat in Qinghai, yet there is no remorse for past failures. I wish that we might not pursue military glory on the frontiers—would this be acceptable? Recently, flatterers have violated the law and constitution, yet all have escaped punishment through favor. I wish that the law might be enforced beginning with those closest to the throne—would this be acceptable? When Empress Wu ruled, the words of the court issued from the mouths of palace women. I wish that eunuchs might not interfere in governance—would this be acceptable? The imperial in-laws present tribute to curry favor with the throne, and high officials and regional commanders have begun to follow suit. I wish that all such offerings beyond taxes and tribute might be abolished—would this be acceptable? Imperial relatives and noble consorts vie for influence, disrupting the order of ranks. I wish that imperial kin might not hold positions in the central administration—would this be acceptable? The late emperor treated his ministers with undue familiarity, undermining the dignity between ruler and minister. I wish that Your Majesty might receive them with ritual propriety—would this be acceptable? Yan Qinyu and Wei Yuejiang were punished for their loyalty, and since then, remonstrating ministers have been discouraged. I wish that all ministers might be permitted to criticize even the most sensitive matters—would this be acceptable? Empress Wu built the Fushan Temple, and the retired emperor constructed the Jinxian and Yuzhen Observatories, each costing millions. I wish that the construction of Daoist and Buddhist temples might cease—would this be acceptable? In Han, the Lü, Wang, Yan, and Liang clans brought the greatest disorder to the state and nation. I wish that we might take this as a warning and establish it as a model for punishment—would this be acceptable?"

The emperor replied: "I am able to implement these."

It was recorded: Mencius said, "One cannot discuss matters with a petty man, nor consult governance with him; only a great man can correct the faults in a ruler’s heart." In the early years of Emperor Xuanzong’s reign, his vigor was sharp, but his heart remained unknown. Yao Yuanzhong, by establishing precedents, sought to correct his heart, guiding what was not upright toward rectitude, perhaps averting later regrets. Yet now, reviewing his ten proposals—such as governance first embracing benevolence, not pursuing frontier glory, enforcing the law beginning with those closest, and eunuchs and imperial kin not interfering in governance—all addressed the failures of personnel and administration at the time, while the essential matter of correcting the ruler’s heart went entirely unmentioned. Moreover, the most crucial proposals are concise; they must be feasible before being presented—this differs from merely making demands of the ruler. Later, the emperor honored and favored frontier generals, indulged in the charms of women, empowered eunuchs and imperial kin, and gave free rein to extravagance, leading to the ruin of the state. How did Yao Yuanzhong’s words ultimately benefit him? From this, we know that the words of great worthies may seem impractical but are in fact incisive, while Yao’s ten proposals seemed incisive but were in fact impractical.

When Minister of Justice Song Jing served as Grand Councilor, his governance focused on selecting the right people, assigning tasks according to their abilities, ensuring that all officials fulfilled their duties, administering rewards and punishments without partiality, and daring to admonish the emperor to his face. The emperor deeply respected and feared him; even when their views differed, he often yielded. The Türks under Mo-ch’uo had long been a scourge to the Middle Kingdom, and despite the court’s exhaustion of the realm’s resources, they could not be subdued. When Hao Lingquan obtained Mo-ch’uo’s head, he considered it an unparalleled achievement. Jing, however, fearing that the emperor’s fondness for martial glory might encourage others to seek fortune through reckless ventures, severely restrained the rewards. Only after a year was Lingquan appointed a captain, and he died weeping in despair.

At that time, Yao Chong and Song Jing served as grand councilors in succession. Chong excelled at adapting to circumstances, while Jing was steadfast in upholding the law and righteousness. Though their principles and conduct differed, they worked in harmony to assist the emperor, lightening taxes and corvée labor, simplifying punishments, and enriching the people. Among the worthy grand councilors of the Tang, the earlier generation praised Fang Xuanling and Du Ruhui, while the later generation praised Yao Chong and Song Jing—no others matched them.

It was recorded: In my humble opinion, Song Jing of Guangping may truly be called a great minister. He showed reverence and fear before the Zhang brothers, humbled himself before Yao Chong, wept bitterly for Hao Lingquan, and resolutely opposed Gao Lishi’s demands—all were the deeds of a great minister.

Had Song Jing and Yao Chong served rulers of the Three Dynasties, could they have matched Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou? The answer is no. Yi Yin declared, "All must possess unified virtue," while the Duke of Zhou aspired to "emulate the Three Kings"—what lofty standards they set! Yet Jing’s governance did no more than restore the institutions of the Zhenguan era. Thus, the horses used in palace ceremonies were soon dismissed again, and the words of actors were swiftly heeded once more. Their achievements were incomplete, and so they cannot be compared to those ancient sages. Nevertheless, in selecting officials and making appointments, in forthright remonstrance despite imperial displeasure—these were acts within the capacity of any grand councilor. To dismiss Jing and Chong as shallow would be a grave error.

Han Xiu served as Vice Director of the Chancellery and concurrently Grand Councilor. A man of stern integrity, he cared nothing for personal gain or glory. Upon assuming the grand councilorship, he fulfilled the expectations of his time, upholding righteousness without flattery. Whenever the emperor indulged in palace banquets or hunted in the imperial gardens, even the slightest impropriety would prompt him to ask his attendants, "Does Han Xiu know of this?" Before the words were fully spoken, a memorial of remonstrance would already have arrived. Once, the emperor gazed into a mirror in silence, looking displeased. His attendants said, "Ever since Han Xiu became grand councilor, Your Majesty has grown noticeably thinner. Why not dismiss him?" The emperor replied, "Though my appearance has grown gaunt, the realm must surely prosper. When Xiao Song submitted memorials, he always aligned with my wishes, yet after his departure, I could not sleep in peace. When Han Xiu remonstrated forcefully, I found rest only after he left. I employ Han Xiu for the sake of the altars of state, not for myself."

It was recorded: When Emperor Xuanzong’s attendants remarked that the grand councilor Han Xiu had made him thin, it was as clear as a bell that his successor, Li Linfu, would make him fat. For the emperor’s emaciation was not for the sake of the realm, but because the allure of beauty was insufficient to please his eyes, the charm of music inadequate to delight his ears, and the flattery of sycophants lacking to gratify his desires. Yet once he obtained the radiant splendor of Yang Guifei, the cunning allure of An Lushan, and the seductive melodies of *Nishang Yuyi*, he was utterly content—how could his heart not swell and his body not grow plump? In the end, his indulgence led him astray, and he was forced into exile, a fate so dire that no outcry was needed to reveal his suffering. Thus, his lament before the mirror foreshadowed the sorrow that would later resound like a tolling bell.

Therefore, the noble man declares: "A ruler’s gaunt appearance while the realm prospers" is but an empty reputation, whereas "a ruler’s plump appearance while the realm suffers" is a true calamity. On the emperor’s millennial birthday, his ministers all presented precious mirrors. Zhang Jiuling said, "The late emperor once declared: 'With bronze as a mirror, one may adjust one’s robes and cap; with history as a mirror, one may perceive the rise and fall of dynasties; with men as a mirror, one may discern success and failure.'"

Thus, he recounted the origins of the rise and fall of past dynasties and compiled a five-volume work: *Founding the State and Establishing the Enterprise* as the first, *Selecting Literary Talent and Preparing Military Strength* as the second, *Repaying the State and Restoring Prosperity* as the third, *Expending One’s Life to Serve the State* as the fourth, and *Discarding Ancient Simplicity and Advancing New Beauty* as the fifth. With these five volumes as a bulwark against calamity, he titled it *The Golden Mirror of a Thousand Autumns*. He urged the Emperor: "Do not take sensual beauty as joy. Should the state later face ruin and the realm collapse, it would be fitting to rectify oneself and govern, reflecting on the past to illuminate the present." The record was presented, and the Emperor bestowed upon it a laudatory inscription.

The record states: According to *The Golden Yi Record*, when Zhang Jiuling served in the Central Secretariat, he burned his elixirs and did not transmit them to the world, entrusting them instead to his two sons-in-law, Han and Song. Thereafter, this record would only circulate among men a thousand years later. Now that it has been obtained and read, how profound it is! These words shine as brightly as the sun and moon. For he not only recognized An Lushan but also all those who shared in the disaster of that time. Was his insight merely into the rise and fall of dynasties? In truth, he was deeply versed in the principles of all things. What is called "distinguishing things as with a mirror" is precisely this—not some casual compilation.

It states: An Lushan was the essence of a wild boar, his belly hanging past his knees. Shi Siming was the essence of a quail-crow, with two feathers growing from his flanks. Yang Guifei was the essence of a white roc, her fingers and nails pure red, bearing the signs of "wood-child" and "double wood," with "wood overcoming metal." It further says: "Neither rhinoceros nor tiger, yet they bound the west and raised the east; with demonic dances and spectral whispers, palaces turned to millet fields." Again, it says: "In governing the state, Your Majesty, long has your benevolent heart grown scarce; loyal admonitions are treated as enemies, while flatterers and sycophants cling together, like sheep and carp adrift." The "sheep" referred to Yang Guozhong, and the "carp" to Li Linfu. As "coconut and oak" advanced together, the state collapsed and the house fell—regret should then turn to remembrance of the past.

It also says: "The sovereign’s tears fell upon Mount Ba; the journey along the Shu Road was arduous. Grace turned to enmity, and only then did he yearn for the foolish." At the height of the Kaiyuan era’s prosperity, before the Tianbao era had ended, how did Jiuling foresee the hardships of the Shu Road and the ease of Lingwu? For his mirror did not merely reflect men’s forms but truly illuminated their hearts, not just the gains and losses of a single era but the rise and fall of two dynasties.

Yet, observing later ages through Jiuling’s eyes, one sees that "demonic dances and spectral whispers" have recurred time and again. How could one obtain Jiuling’s foresight and discuss with him the rise and fall of states?

When Yan Zhenqing, the Governor of Pingyuan, learned of An Lushan’s rebellion, he took advantage of the prolonged rains to repair the city walls, dredge the moats, muster the able-bodied, and fill the granaries. Lushan, dismissing him as a mere scholar, did not take him seriously. When the rebellion erupted, Lushan assigned seven thousand soldiers from Pingyuan and Boyang to guard the river fords. Zhenqing resisted, then dispatched Li Ping, the Prefectural Military Officer of Pingyuan, to take a secret route and report to the court. When the court learned of Lushan’s rebellion, it heard only that the commanderies and counties of Hebei had all surrendered at the first sign of trouble. The Emperor sighed in dismay: "Among the twenty-four commanderies, is there not a single righteous man?"

When Li Ping arrived, the Emperor rejoiced greatly: "I do not know what Yan Zhenqing looks like, yet he has acted thus!" Zhenqing sent his personal guests to secretly carry copies of the rebels’ documents to the various commanderies, and as a result, many commanderies responded in kind.

The record states: Confucius said, "If the ruler values ritual, none among the people dare be disrespectful. If the ruler values righteousness, none dare be disobedient. If the ruler values trustworthiness, none dare be insincere." The Sage spoke these words to set an example for the world, ever fearful that it would follow the wind and bend. In the era of Emperor Minghuang, flattery and pleasing appearances were prized, while ritual, righteousness, and trustworthiness were swept away entirely. To then lament the absence of a single righteous man—is this not absurd? From this, one knows the greatness of the Three Bonds and the weight of the Four Virtues, which cannot be absent for a single day. How could the customs of the Tang and Yu dynasties be mere empty talk?

When Yan Gaoqing raised troops, he had only eight days to prepare his defenses, which were still incomplete when Shi Siming and Cai Xide led their forces to the city walls. Gaoqing sent word to Wang Chengye, who, coveting the credit for himself, held back his troops and refused to aid him. Gaoqing fought day and night, but when his provisions and arrows were exhausted, the city fell, and the rebels took him and Yuan Lüqian captive, sending them to Luoyang. Lushan reproached him: "You were but a minor official in Fan Prefecture, and I recommended you for the post of judge. In just a few years, you rose to governor—how have I wronged you that you rebel?" Gaoqing, eyes closed, cursed him: "You were but a Khitan slave herding sheep in Yingzhou, yet the Son of Heaven raised you to the rank of military governor of three circuits. No favor has been greater—how have you been wronged that you rebel? I am a lifelong subject of the Tang; my rank and emoluments all come from the Tang. Even if you recommended me, how could I follow you in rebellion? I am punishing a traitor for the state—how could I not slay you? What rebellion is this?" Lushan, enraged, had both Gaoqing and Lüqian dismembered, yet even in death, they did not cease their curses.

The record states: Observing the two gentlemen of the Yan family, how could their resolve be merely about facing death in a moment of peril? For they upheld the three-hundred-year bond between ruler and minister of the Tang. Since the rebellion in Jinyang and the betrayal of Liu and Pei against the Sui, and the Mandate of Heaven bestowed upon the Zhou and Tang, for over a hundred years, men had forgotten what it meant to submit to principle and die for righteousness. When news of the two Yans’ actions spread, it was as if they had descended from heaven or risen from the earth. Thus it was said: "I do not know what Yan Zhenqing looks like, yet he has acted thus!" Though their bodies were crushed and their tongues severed, their fragrance spread far, their glory shone forth, surpassing the corrupt Sui and redeeming the tyrannical Zhou. Was this not magnificent?

When Zhang Xun raised troops to resist Lushan, Linghu Chao besieged him at Yongqiu for over forty days. Hearing that Emperor Xuanzong had fled to Shu, six of Xun’s generals urged him, saying the enemy’s forces were too strong and the Emperor’s fate unknown—it would be better to surrender. Xun feigned agreement. The next day, he set up the Emperor’s portrait in the hall and led his officers to pay homage. Bringing the six generals before him, he rebuked them for their lack of principle and executed them, steeling the resolve of his troops.

With five hundred dead-set warriors, he launched a raid on Chao’s camp, prompting Chao to reinforce the siege. Xun dispatched General Lei Wanspring to the city wall to parley with Chao. Before their words were finished, enemy crossbows struck him—six arrows pierced his face, yet he stood unmoved. Suspecting a wooden effigy, Chao sent scouts to investigate and was stunned. From afar, he called to Xun: “Just now, seeing General Lei, I understood the discipline of your army. Yet what can you do against the Dao of Heaven?” Xun replied: “You fail to grasp human ethics—how could you know the Dao of Heaven?”

**Recorded Note:** Was Xun’s sacrifice of life for righteousness in vain? Only when perception is settled does one’s center hold firm. With a firm center, affairs can be resolved and merit achieved. When human ethics are fulfilled, the principles of Heaven naturally appear. Thus we hear of the Great Tang’s restoration, never of the rebels’ triumph; we hear of Zhang and Xu’s enduring legacy, never of Linghu’s immortality. Who says moments of haste and peril are not times for unhurried adherence to the Middle Way?

Yin Ziqi besieged Suiyang for months. As provisions ran out, the city debated abandoning it. Zhang Xun and Xu Yuan counseled: “Suiyang is the shield of Jiang and Huai. If we abandon it, the rebels will surge forward unchecked—Jiang and Huai will be lost.” They resolved to hold fast. At first, soldiers ate tea leaves and paper; when those were gone, they ate the horses. Horses exhausted, they trapped sparrows and dug for rats. When even those were gone, Xun brought out his beloved concubine and slaughtered her to feed his men; Yuan likewise killed his servant. Then they gathered the city’s women to eat, followed by the old and weak men. Though all knew death was certain, none defected. Only four hundred remained.

On the *guichou* day, the rebels scaled the walls. The defenders, too weak to fight, could only watch. Xun faced west and bowed: “My strength is spent. I cannot save the city. In life, I failed to repay Your Majesty; in death, I will become a vengeful ghost to slay the rebels.”

**Recorded Note:** Can we truly believe in vengeful ghosts? Peng Sheng and Bo Yi were but two men’s grievances—yet Suiyang’s martyrs perfected a virtue for ten thousand generations. Their strength could be broken, but not their will; their bodies could fall, but not their *qi*.

Though the loyal souls and righteous spirits cannot be seen or heard, when Chu Xiong turned his blade against his own kin at dawn, or when righteousness wielded the halberd as if moved by ghosts and gods—who can say they were not vengeful? The Tang restored its lost lands, yet could not exact vengeance upon the bodies of An and Shi. Does this mean the words of vengeful ghosts cannot be trusted?

In the second year of Jianzhong during the reign of Emperor Dezong, Guo Ziyi, the Loyal and Martial King of Fenyang, passed away. As the Tang’s supreme general, he commanded vast armies. Cheng Yuanzhen and Yu Chao’en slandered him relentlessly, yet a single imperial summons brought him to the capital without delay, thus silencing their calumnies. Once, when he sent an envoy to Tian Chengsi’s domain, Chengsi gazed in all directions before bowing and declaring, “These knees have not bent to another for many years.” When Li Lingyao seized Bianzhou, he seized all public and private goods passing through, yet dared not touch Guo’s property, instead dispatching troops to escort it safely beyond his borders. Guo’s official salary as *Zhongshu Ling* totaled twenty thousand *jin* over twenty-four months, not including his private wealth. His treasuries overflowed with treasures, his household numbered three thousand, eight sons and seven sons-in-law held high office, and his dozens of grandsons were too many to greet individually—he merely nodded in acknowledgment. Pugu Huai’en, Li Huaiguang, and Hun Cheng all emerged from his command; though ennobled as dukes and princes, they remained at his beck and call, rushing to serve before him. For thirty years, the empire’s fate rested upon his shoulders. His merits eclipsed all others, yet the emperor never doubted him; he rose to the highest rank, yet none envied him; he indulged in extravagance, yet none criticized him. He died at eighty-five, and many of his generals and aides became renowned ministers.

**Recorded Note:** The rise and retreat of Fenyang were tied to the empire’s stability. Why, then, was he not spared jealousy? First, Chao’en pulled him forward; then, Yuanzhen dragged him back—yet Guo bore no grudge. Why? The *Book of Changes* states: *“In the time of Pi, it is not the man; it is not favorable for the superior man to persist. The small departs, the great arrives—auspicious and smooth.”* In the era of Suzong and Daizong, the superior man found no advantage. Yet, relying on one man’s life to uphold the empire’s might, he fulfilled his resolve to turn peril into safety—this was the small departing and the great arriving. When summoned, he answered without hesitation; when not, he bore all with patience. Thus, when he wished for leisure, he found it; when he ordered dispersal, it was done. Wherever he turned, he was at ease. The An Lushan rebellion? He emerged once. The Tubo invasion? He emerged again. The Huai’en crisis? He emerged twice more. The Uyghur threat? Again, he emerged. Had he ignored the warning of *Baosang*, been swayed by shameful slander, known only safety and not danger, or profit and not harm, his life would have been imperiled, and the state would have followed. How could this be the great man’s auspicious smoothness?

In the first year of Xingyuan, after the amnesty was prepared, the emperor entrusted the edict to Lu Zhi for review. Knowing the emperor’s virtue was not steadfast, Lu submitted a memorial: “To move men with words is already shallow; if the words are not earnest, who will heed them? This decree must express deep remorse and full accountability. Let the realm hear it, and all will transform as if emerging from thick darkness into radiant light.” The emperor then issued an edict: “Reared in the depths of the palace, I was ignorant of governance. Habit led me astray; in ease, I forgot peril. I did not know the hardship of farming or the toil of soldiers. My grace did not reach the people; my heart did not connect with the land. Affairs became obstructed, and the people grew suspicious. Unaware of my own faults, I provoked war. Armies were raised from all directions, supplies transported from afar. Taxes and conscriptions spread chaos near and far. The people labored under burdens, yet I did not awaken to Heaven’s warnings or the people’s anger. Thus, rebellion arose, the capital was shaken, all things lost order, the ancestral temples trembled. Above, I failed my forebears; below, I betrayed the people. My heart shames me; the fault is mine alone. My remorse is bottomless, as if falling into an abyss. From now on, all memorials shall omit the titles *Sacred, Martial, Civil, and Martial*.” When the amnesty was proclaimed, the people rejoiced.

The following year, Li Baozhen entered the court and reported: “In Shandong, the amnesty was announced, and the soldiers wept with gratitude. Seeing the people’s response, I know the rebels cannot stand.” **Recorded Note:** The *Hexagram Yang*’s fourth line states: *“Yang has hills—beyond the thoughts of the common.”* The fifth line says: *“Yang defiles its great name.”* Truly, one who treads extraordinary peril cannot be secured by ordinary means; one who resolves extraordinary chaos cannot be enlightened by common words. If sincerity is lacking, the people will not be moved; if self-reduction is not extreme, benefits will not be fully realized. Indeed, virtue spreads faster than couriers bearing orders. Dezong knew Heaven had raised Li Xian for the state, yet did not grasp that the people’s hearts, once stirred, would leave the rebels no foothold. In peril, he sought loyal counsel; in peace, he turned against forthright speech. Thus, though he cast aside his peach and gained his wish, he could not cleanse his flock and achieve greatness. What a pity.

Lu Zhi vehemently condemned Pei Yanling’s treachery, enumerating his crimes: “Yanling treats extortion as strategy, deceit as wisdom, hoarding and resentment as selflessness, and slander as loyalty. He is the Gonggong of Yao’s age, the Shaoyou of Lu’s realm.” The memorial displeased the emperor. Though Lu treated him as a confidant, whenever matters displeased him, he would argue fiercely.

Those close to him sometimes cautioned against his excessive zeal, to which he replied: “I neither betray the Son of Heaven above nor betray what I have studied below—nothing else concerns me.”

The record observes: How could one bear to betray the Son of Heaven? Yet when the sovereign grows arrogant, his ministers become obsequious; when the ruler is suspicious, his courtiers turn sycophantic. This is the Son of Heaven’s own betrayal of himself—how could he willingly betray what he has studied? To treat extortion as the highest strategy and hoarding as sound policy is to regret one’s own learning. The noble man, however, does not act thus.

What the noble man studies is how to become a sage or a worthy. Thus, the rulership of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu is what he holds himself accountable to; the ministerial conduct of Gaoyao, Yi, Fu, Zhou, and Shao is what he aspires to emulate. If the ruler is harsh and exacting, he responds with loyalty and kindness; if the ruler is jealous and distrustful, he offers reverence and sincerity. Is this a forced fit of square pegs into round holes? No—his inner truth is simply thus.

Mencius did not say: “If my lord cannot [be virtuous], he is a thief”? Then to betray what one has studied is truly worse than a burglar’s tunnel—yet how can the Son of Heaven teach others to betray their learning?

Li Chen’s family of a hundred mouths, along with the households of the Divine Strategy Army’s soldiers, all remained in Chang’an. When anyone in the army mentioned home, Chen wept and said: “Where is the Son of Heaven? How dare we speak of home?” When Zhu Ci sent a trusted messenger with a letter from Chen’s family, saying, “Your household is safe,” Chen grew furious: “How dare you relay inquiries from rebels?” He had the man executed on the spot.

The record observes: One who acts for all under Heaven does not consider his family—even if he did, what good would it do? The *Book of Changes* says: “In peril, with sincerity, the heart finds clarity, and action is esteemed.” At the time, Zhu Ci had seized the capital, and Huai Guang had rebelled in Xianyang—danger compounded by hardship. Without unwavering resolve, the mind would falter; how then could one achieve success? Not only could one not attend to family and possessions, but the state itself would be lost.

Later, when [Li Chen] was granted a mansion with furnishings, and his procession was met with banners and escorts, how could it compare to his former household? Even if there had been kin like Xian or Tai among the rebels, how could he not have treated them well? How could he have overthrown them?

In the third year of Yuanhe during the reign of Emperor Xianzong, Pei Chi served as *Zhongshu Shilang* and *Tong Pingzhangshi*. Initially, Emperor Dezong did not entrust matters to his chief ministers, handling even minor affairs himself. When the emperor was still in his princely residence, he recognized the impropriety of this, and upon ascending the throne, he selected and promoted chief ministers, entrusting them with his full confidence. Pei Chi, too, devoted himself sincerely to assisting the ruler. Once, the emperor asked Pei Chi what should take precedence in governance. He replied, "First, rectify the heart."

When Emperor Muzong ascended the throne, he once saw the calligraphic works of Liu Gongquan, the judicial officer of Aizhou, and admired them, appointing him as *You Shi Yi*. The emperor asked Liu Gongquan, "How is it that your calligraphy is so excellent?" He replied, "The brush follows the heart; when the heart is upright, the brush is upright." The emperor fell silent and altered his expression, for he understood that Liu was admonishing him through his brush.

It is recorded: Since the time of Emperor Taizong of Tang, there have been many remonstrators, but none have probed so deeply to the root as Pei Chi’s "first rectify the heart" or Liu Gongquan’s "when the heart is upright, the brush is upright." Yet in the end, Emperor Xianzong could not rectify his later years, nor could Emperor Muzong rectify his early reign—why? It is said: The heart is merely *li* (principle). Though the vessel is inherent in man, *li* truly emanates from Heaven; without study, there is no way to illuminate it. Thus, the *Way of the Great Learning* begins with *gewu zhizhi* (investigating things and extending knowledge) and culminates in *yicheng xinzheng* (making intentions sincere and rectifying the heart). Its sequence cannot be disordered, nor its effort omitted. Pei and Liu could open the path but could not complete the discourse; Emperors Xianzong and Muzong merely heard the words but could not awaken to their truth. No wonder then—like one who seeks immortality yet neglects humanity, or like a land left desolate and ungoverned—what is the heart for? Only a long sigh remains.

Since the late Yuanhe era, the eunuchs grew increasingly overbearing, installing and deposing emperors at their whim, their authority surpassing even that of the sovereign, yet none dared speak against them. In the second year of Taihe under Emperor Wenzong, Liu Ze of Changping presented a memorial in response to the imperial examination, forthrightly exposing their calamities. In brief, he declared: "Your Majesty’s foremost concern should be the impending upheaval in the palace, the peril to the altars of state, the imminent collapse of the realm, and the looming chaos across the land."

He further warned: "If Your Majesty wishes to forestall the gradual encroachment of usurpation and regicide, then let the ruler occupy his rightful place, draw near to upright men, distance himself from the ignoble wielders of the knife and saw, and befriend the forthright of noble grain. Let your ministers of state fulfill their duties without hindrance, and let all officials guard their posts. Why, then, entrust the governance of the empire to five or six men of debased familiarity? Disaster ripens within the palace walls, and treachery festers behind the curtains. I fear that Cao Jie and Hou Lan have been reborn in our time."

Again, he lamented: "The loyal and worthy are not entrusted as confidants, while the eunuchs of the inner palace wield the power to depose and enthrone. They caused the late emperor to fail in rectifying his reign’s end, leaving Your Majesty unable to rectify its beginning."

He urged: "Why does Your Majesty not block the path of hidden malice, banish the ministers of debased intimacy, curb the hearts that encroach and coerce, restore the duties of gatekeeping and sweeping, heed what must be heeded, and grieve what must be grieved?"

The examiners, Feng Su and others, all marveled and approved, yet feared the eunuchs and dared not select his response.

The record states: That such forthright speech arose in the reign of Emperor Wenzong is like one who, starving in broad daylight, beats the drum and races about—though the distance from Heaven remains vast, it reveals at least that he could not remain idle. This is to mark the impending end of the Tang’s mandate.

*Hongdao Record*, Volume Fourteen, concludes.

**"The Righteousness Between Ruler and Minister"**

From *The History of the Song*: At the beginning of Emperor Taizu’s reign, Jiaozhou, Guangzhou, Jiannan, Taiyuan, Jinghu, Jiangbiao, Liao, and Xia were all rival states. He therefore paid close attention to his generals and commanders, dispatching Li Hanchao to garrison Guannan, Ma Renpu to defend Yingzhou, Han Lingkun to hold Changzhou, He Weizhong to guard Yizhou, He Jiyun to command Dizhou, Guo Jin to control Xishan, Wu Shouqi to fortify Jinzhou, Li Qianpu to defend Dizhou, Li Jixun to pacify Zhaoyi and resist Taiyuan, Zhao Zan to station at Yanzhou, Yao Neifu to guard Qingzhou, Dong Zunhao to encamp at Huanzhou, Wang Yansheng to defend Yuanzhou, and Feng Jiye to garrison Lingwu in preparation against Western Xia. Their clansmen residing in Bianjing were treated with great generosity; all profits from state monopolies in their commanderies were granted to them, and they were permitted to engage in trade freely, exempt from transit taxes. They were also allowed to recruit fugitives as their personal enforcers. In all military matters, they were granted full discretion. Whenever they came to court, the emperor would summon them for private audience, seat them, and bestow lavish rewards before sending them off. As a result, the frontier commanders grew wealthy, enabling them to maintain elite troops, employ spies, and thoroughly understand enemy movements. When invaders arrived, ambushes and surprise attacks often led to victory. For twenty years, there was no anxiety from the northwest, and eventually Shu, Chu, Wu, and Yue were pacified, every campaign achieving its aim. This was the result of his ability to govern his subordinates with wholehearted sincerity.

The record states: In my humble observation, Emperor Taizu’s grand strategy comprised five elements: first, the ability to recognize men of talent; second, the skill to employ them effectively; third, the practice of extending complete trust...

Abundant generosity in rewards and comfort, the fourth; as for the profits from state monopolies, he entrusted them entirely to his generals, allowing them free rein in trade and acting always as they saw fit—this, the fifth.

Today, the north suffers the harassment of the Tartar raiders, while the south contends with the intrigues of Jiaozhi. The revenues from state monopolies, though incorporated into the regular fiscal system, are not the proper subject of debate here. Yet the wealth derived from the maritime trade of the southeastern barbarians is beyond calculation. Those who deliberate on statecraft speak only of channeling profit without addressing the issue, while those who clarify the law speak only of opening the frontier without discussion—both fail to understand human nature. For every one benefit, there are ten harms, yet they remain heedless.

Now the seas have been calm for not merely three years. Ships come and go as if traveling a well-trodden path, so much so that the Fujian proverb declares the sea "ripe"—and this is no empty saying. The foreign barbarians profit from their trade, while China gains nothing in return. I humbly submit that this has not been given due thought.

The wealth of the Eastern Sea lies in salt. Beyond salt, there are also timber of a thousand spans and spices by the myriad bushels. The military administrations of the Two Guangs have long relied on these resources, following established regulations. Why not transfer a portion of the trade from Fujian and Zhejiang, establish a sealed treasury to exchange for the submission of Annam, and thereby secure the surplus profits? With these, we could address the anxieties of the northwest—this too would be feasible. Why, then, is this treated as a taboo and left unspoken?

To abandon such measures and instead focus narrowly on suppressing informants and seizing goods, thereby increasing the bait for bandits and smugglers, is not what one would call a grand strategy.

Emperor Taizong said to Song Qi and others: "The order or chaos of an age depends on rewards matching merit and punishments fitting crimes—then there is nothing that cannot be governed. If these are merely tools to adorn one’s anger or delight, then there is nothing that cannot be thrown into chaos. You, my ministers, must take heed."

The Emperor further addressed Lü Mengzheng: "When a scholar has yet to attain office and sees the affairs of the age deviating from principle, he feels discontent in his heart. Once he ascends to a position where he may propose what is proper and reject what is not, he ought to exhaust all that he has accumulated—though his words may not be exhaustive, he should still submit proposals for revision to bring them into accord with the Dao. I certainly do not rely on my lofty status to deter others from speaking.

It is recorded: The utility of a king lies in rewards and punishments; the utility of a minister lies in offering counsel and correction. Taizong may be said to have grasped the essence of governance. Yet when we observe his actions, were they truly so? As for Duoduo’s rivalry with Zhao Pu—these two could not coexist. Had the Emperor cherished Pu, he would have first removed Duoduo. Even if he insisted that rewards and punishments issue solely from himself, who would have objected? Instead, he allowed them to scheme against Tingmei, for the Emperor’s heart was set upon Tingmei. Thus, not only did he wield rewards and punishments as tools to adorn his anger or delight, but he also missed the subtle shifts of success and failure.

After Chai Yutang’s report of treason, today we reward the merit of informants, and tomorrow we deliberate the case of the court scribe—among the ranks of high and low officials, were there none who perceived the affairs of the age? Yet the Grand Preceptor Wang Pu and seventy-four others flattered and complied, leading their sovereign into unrighteousness. Could this be called bringing things into accord with the Dao? It was not merely a matter of relying on his lofty status.

Li Hang, from youth, possessed a magnanimous and far-reaching demeanor. His father, Bing, once told others: 'This child is extraordinary—he will surely rise to the highest offices.' Once, while attending an informal banquet, Taizong remarked as he sent him off: 'Li Hang’s bearing is dignified and steadfast—truly a man of nobility.' When Zhenzong inquired about the principles of governance, Hang replied first: 'The most urgent priority is to avoid employing frivolous, ambitious newcomers who delight in stirring up trouble.'

One evening, an emissary was dispatched bearing a handwritten edict to elevate Lady Liu to the rank of Noble Consort. Hang, in the presence of the messenger, lit a candle and burned the edict, attaching a memorial that read: 'Simply report that Minister Hang deems this inadvisable.' The matter was thus abandoned.

It is recorded: Observing the act of burning the edict by candlelight, I cannot but admire the noble integrity of [Li Hang, posthumously titled] Wenjing. To return a sealed document is already a praiseworthy act; to amend or supplement it is a grand gesture—how much more so to burn it? Had his heart not been vast and his judgment of the Grand Duke [Jiang Ziya] unshakably firm, he would not have remained unmoved by considerations of profit and harm. Moreover, what was Lady Liu? By her lineage, she was most humble; by her skills, most base; by her surname, most distant. 'A flat stone beneath one’s shoe—how low!' Did the Emperor not reflect? Yet her nature was alert and quick, versed in calligraphy and documents, and through this, the gradual foundations of governance were laid. Hang’s foresight not only quietly averted the subtle warning of 'treading on frost' but also openly rejected the imperial decree as if it were a sacred edict. Later, Li Di’s refusal to comply with flattery and Yang Yi’s refusal to draft an improper decree—these were all those who rose in emulation of his example. Who would say that the actions of that moment did not bear upon the gains and losses of an entire reign?

The Emperor, noting that Hang never submitted secret memorials, asked him: 'Everyone else presents confidential reports—why do you alone refrain?' Hang replied: 'As a minister bearing the weight of the office of Grand Councilor, I speak openly of public matters. What need is there for secret memorials? If a minister submits confidential reports, they are either slanderous or sycophantic. I have always despised such things—how could I imitate them?'

It is recorded: Since the flourishing of the wind of slander and deceit, the calamity of mutual destruction has arisen—never has there been a greater harm than secret memorials. The most cunning deceivers are those who point to a deer and call it a horse; the most insidious flatterers are those who point to a crow and call it a phoenix. Yet there remains a deer that can be pointed to, a crow that can be examined—though their intent is to deceive their sovereign, their reasoning may still be traced."

As for the submission of sealed memorials, in their inception, they leave no trace, their origins concealed—no one knows of them. In the end, they pass from one hand to another, yet by what evidence can they be verified? How much worse is it than calling a musk deer a greyhound, or turning white into black? During the reign of Zhenzong, the likes of Wang Qinruo and Ding Wei thronged the court. One of their accusations against Li Hang was precisely that he treated them as they deserved. Yet from the perspective of a true gentleman, how could one, standing beneath the vast sky and under the transforming light of the sun, tolerate even the slightest shadow of concealment, much less willingly place oneself in the realm of private favoritism?

The heart of the petty man is otherwise: in his own affairs, he seeks only convenience and profit; in dealing with others, he harbors only resentment or envy. Profit cannot advance without flattery, and envy cannot penetrate without slander. Slander and flattery are what people deeply detest. Thus, under the guise of secrecy, they peddle their treacherous schemes. Moreover, they exploit the sovereign’s subtle, inexpressible anger and probe the hidden thoughts that cannot be laid bare. Between ruler and minister, they claim to be as inseparable as glue and lacquer, with no flaw to be found. They even seal their memorials with signs and mark them with official seals, their hearts fierce as tigers and wings swift as eagles. Wherever they point, they deceive heaven and delude men, stopping at nothing—what do they have to fear? As a result, the sovereign’s hearing becomes biased, his trust becomes one-sided. Not only do the people suffer in darkness from their calamities, but the court itself is openly disrupted by their machinations. This is why Li Hang’s admonition is revered across the ages.

Zhang Qixian was a man of fervent ambition and grand vision, ever aspiring to guide his sovereign. Once, he spoke to Zhenzong at leisure, tracing the Dao of emperors and kings to its roots and explaining its essence. The emperor said, “I believe the Dao of emperors and kings leaves no trace. As long as all affairs are properly governed, one approaches the Dao.” It is recorded: *The Greater Odes* states, “Do not act thus perversely.” Zhenzong, it seems, had not reflected upon this. For the term “emperors and kings” refers to Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—their Dao was to hold fast to the center, a transmission of utmost refinement and singular focus. Thus, it resides in the heart as the virtue of heaven and manifests in governance as the kingly Way. The reverence for heaven, diligence for the people, and the proper ordering of human affairs and spiritual rites, as recorded in the classics—how can these be called “without trace”? To say it leaves no trace is but vague, rootless speech, wild and unprincipled words. Alas! Zhang Qixian began well but did not see it through. He sought extraordinary rewards but failed to grasp the enduring principles of canonical models and instructive admonitions, which are not found in obscure mysteries or bizarre, world-defying frugality, but simply in the realm of daily conduct and common practice. Later, the doctrine of “governing through spiritual teachings” indeed aligned with this view, leading to rampant fabrication and deception, with no limit to their excesses. Thus, the ford and shore of the Dao grew distant indeed.

Han Qi, from an early age, bore a illustrious reputation, his insight and magnanimity towering above others. In matters of state, his joy or anger never showed on his face. Serving twice as Grand Councilor, he implemented great strategies to secure the altars of state. At a time when the court faced many crises, Han Qi navigated perilous uncertainties, acting without hesitation. Someone once said to him, “What you do is truly good. But if, by chance, you stumble, not only will you fail to protect yourself, but your family will have no place to stand.” Han Qi sighed and replied, “What kind of talk is this? A minister must exert all his strength in serving his sovereign, staking his life upon it. As for success or failure, that is up to heaven. How can one fret over possible failure and thus shrink from action?” Those who heard this were filled with admiration and respect. In all his proposals, he considered only where righteousness lay, without partiality or prejudice, and alongside Fu Bi, he left behind a legacy of meritorious deeds. Thus, when people of that era spoke of worthy ministers, they invariably mentioned “Fu and Han.” It is recorded: Han Qi’s “acting without hesitation” was first articulated by Mencius, who said, “One who delights in securing the altars of state is a minister who secures the altars of state.” Another interpretation states: “A great minister’s plan to secure the altars of state is like a lesser minister’s duty to please his sovereign.” Devoted to this principle without wavering, how could he be swayed by considerations of safety or danger, profit or harm? If one’s heart is moved by such concerns, one is unfit for great deeds.

Bao Zheng was stern, upright, and resolute. He detested harsh and oppressive officials, and in governance, he emphasized sincerity and generosity. Though he loathed evil as one would an enemy, he never failed to extend loyalty and forbearance to others. He never curried favor, nor did he feign pleasantries to please others. Throughout his life, he kept no private correspondence. When he served as Prefect of Kaifeng, even the powerful relatives and eunuchs of the court restrained themselves, and officials and commoners dared not deceive him. Even children and women knew his name, calling him “Vice Director Bao.” In the capital, a saying arose: “If your connections don’t reach him, you’ll meet old Bao, the Yama King.” His integrity was likened to the clarity of the Yellow River. It is recorded: In my humble observation, the metaphor of “Yama King Bao” is unprecedented in history, unheard of until now. Yet it arises from the hearts of the people and aligns with the principles of heaven. Those who are wronged—we will surely correct them; the upright—we will surely vindicate them. The truth—we will surely investigate it; the false—we will surely expose it. There has never been a case where right and wrong were not adjudicated, where crooked and straight were not distinguished, and where arbitrary willfulness became the wellspring of secret memorials. If the netherworld truly had a Yama King, he would surely elevate the good and cast down the wicked. If not, heaven itself would punish him—how much more so mere mortals? In recent times, some have flaunted their “unyielding integrity,” yet they act recklessly, oblivious to all around them, as if no one else exists. Before long, they vanish without a trace. Not only will they find it hard to escape the judgment of the Supreme Emperor, but they will also face the punishment of the Yama King. What, then, remains of their “unreachable connections”?

Zhao Pu served as Supervising Censor and impeached officials without fear of the powerful or favored, his reputation awe-inspiring. The capital called him “Iron-Faced Zhao.”

He insisted that the court must clearly distinguish between the noble-minded and the petty, arguing that even minor faults in the latter should be firmly suppressed and eradicated, while the former, if mistakenly judged, ought to be preserved and cherished to nurture their virtue. Many eminent officials of the time found security in his stance. Later transferred to serve as Fiscal Commissioner of the Zizhou Circuit, he was soon reassigned to Yizhou. The western lands of Shu were remote, its people vulnerable, and its officials brazenly flouted the law, with prefectures and commanderies exchanging public gifts. Zhao entered Shu ahead of his retinue, accompanied only by a single horse, a zither, and a crane. His governance was simple and unburdened, marked by magnanimity, integrity, and self-cultivation; no one ever saw him display joy or anger. Each day’s affairs, once concluded, he would report to heaven at night, clad in full court attire, burning incense in the open air—whatever he could not honestly declare, he dared not do. His administration was effective, adapting to local customs with a balance of firmness and leniency. In Chengdu, his reputation became especially celebrated. Whenever Emperor Shenzong issued edicts to regional governors, he invariably cited Zhao as an exemplar, emphasizing that governance must be rooted in beneficence and advantage.

In his later years, he delved into the Dao and attained insight. As he neared the end, he bid farewell to his son Zhao Fan, his composure unshaken, and passed away in quiet repose. Han Qi once praised Zhao as a true paragon of his age, declaring him beyond compare.

**Record states:** Zhao Qingmo’s attainment of the Dao—was it through the power of elixirs, cinnabar, or mercury? No. It arose from the aid of tempering desire to nurture the heart, and the proof of his pure conduct transcending worldly俗. This is something no one can afford to ignore. Nowadays, those who refine their forms like withered wood or cast off restraints like whirling winds—who would not call them "attained"? Yet they contribute nothing to human relations or worldly teachings, merely seeking a fleeting, self-serving survival. The noble-minded do not follow such a path. How much finer to leave behind grace that endures in others, to accumulate virtue in all things, so that court and countryside resound with one voice, and no distinction remains between inner and outer realms. Such was Zhao Qinxian: though heaven and earth may perish, his heroic spirit remains boundless. No wonder he is deemed beyond reach.

Lu Zongdao, as Right Rectifier of the Court of Judicature and Revision, spoke without fear or evasion in his memorials. Emperor Zhenzong once inscribed on the palace wall: *"Lu the Upright,"* in remembrance of him. When Lu later entered the Secretariat, he repeatedly offered forthright counsel.

At the time, Empress Dowager Mingsu held court. Once, she asked how Empress Wu of Tang compared as a ruler. Lu Zongdao replied: "She was a criminal of the Tang, nearly bringing ruin to the altars of state." The Empress Dowager fell silent.

A minor official, Fang Zhongxi, petitioned to establish the Seven Ancestral Temples of the Liu clan. The Empress Dowager sought counsel, but the assisting ministers dared not respond. Zongdao alone stepped forward and said: "If the Seven Ancestral Temples of the Liu clan are established, what will become of the heir apparent?" The matter was thus abandoned.

On another occasion, the Empress Dowager accompanied the Emperor to Cixiao Temple. She wished to ride in the imperial palanquin ahead of the Emperor. Zongdao said: "In death, a husband follows his son—such is the Way of a woman." The Empress Dowager then ordered her palanquin to follow behind.

During his seven years as chief minister, Zongdao was unyielding and detested evil. Those among the imperial relatives and favored courtiers who neglected their duties all feared him, calling him the "Fish-Head Chief Minister," both for his surname and his unyielding nature.

Later, Xue Kui succeeded him as chief minister. His disposition was likewise upright and uncompromising; he did not curry favor and spoke boldly on all matters. When the Empress Dowager wished to don the *yibiao* and *mian* crown for a visit to the Imperial Ancestral Temple, Kui said: "If you must wear these, how then will you perform the rites of obeisance?" As she lay on her deathbed, the Emperor, weeping before his assembled ministers, said: "The Empress Dowager is too ill to speak, yet she repeatedly tugs at her robes, as if wishing to convey something. What does it mean?" Kui replied: "It must concern the *yibiao* and *mian* crown. How could she face the late Emperor in the underworld wearing them?" The Emperor understood, and she was ultimately interred in her proper mourning attire.

The record states: The integrity of Shi Yu was only recognized after his death; the unyielding backbone of Zongdao was renowned in his own lifetime.

When Yin served as chief minister, officials of the Selection Bureau never consulted with one another—how could there be one called the "Fish-Head Chief Minister"? Yet the excesses of Empress Mingsu far surpassed those of Wu Zetian. Nevertheless, the remonstrances of these two gentlemen required no elaborate persuasion, for they invoked principle with precision and urgency, upon which the living and the dead alike depended. Could this not be attributed to the dynastic house’s tradition of fostering such conduct? Otherwise, how could both their words and actions have been so perilous?

It is recorded that Fu Yaoyu could compose essays at the age of ten. Shi Jie and Yan Zhu both marveled at him, saying: "Your discernment is keen, your bearing refined; your writing is concise yet exhaustive in principle. You possess the makings of a chief minister." When Wang Anshi later implemented his New Policies, Yaoyu, though on good terms with him, vehemently opposed every measure he found unworkable. When Cai Que was demoted, seven or eight officials—from chief ministers and grand councilors down to attendants—were dismissed, leaving the Censorate and the government bureaus virtually empty. Yaoyu said: "Those who were Cai’s most egregious partisans were right to be banished, but the rest should be left alone. I hope Your Majesty will regard their words as no more than the buzzing of gnats and flies, and not allow the slightest disturbance to disrupt the great harmony of *qi*. This is how the sage-kings nurtured perfect sincerity to secure lasting fortune."

Later, when he was reassigned from remonstrance official to prefect, he enforced every law, even those he deemed flawed, saying: "The noble person acts in accordance with his station. As a remonstrance official, one bears the duty to speak; as a prefect, one must uphold the law." He was subsequently appointed Vice Director of the Secretariat. Emperor Shenzong remarked to the Grand Empress Dowager: "Vice Director Fu’s purity and integrity have remained unchanged from beginning to end. He is a gentleman of gold and jade." Sima Guang said to Shao Yong: "The virtues of purity, integrity, and courage are difficult to combine in one person, yet I see them all in Qin Zhi." Yong replied: "Qin Zhi is pure but not ostentatious, upright but not strident, courageous yet temperate—this is what makes him exceptional."

The record states: The so-called gentleman of gold and jade traces his lineage to the *Wei Feng*’s "Qi Ao," where he is likened to "gold and tin, to jade tablets and disks." The exegetes explain: "Gold and tin" signify the refinement of his tempering, while "jade tablets and disks" denote the warmth and luster of his innate nature. Even Duke Wu of Wei could not claim sole glory for such virtues. Thereafter, those who were haughty often clashed, those who formed cliques often schemed, turning the court into a den of leopards and tigers, a thicket of thorns, a realm of demons and barbarians. How could the noble person do more than grind and polish such a world as one would a whetstone? How could he refine its raw jade or reveal its golden and jadelike essence? Thus, one cannot merely admire the perfected virtue of such men; their rise and fall indeed reflect the world’s ascent and decline, the Dao’s purity and corruption.

When Sima Guang served as Remonstrance Official, he presented three memorials to the throne. The first addressed the three virtues of a ruler: benevolence, wisdom, and martial prowess. Benevolence does not mean coddling or indulgence; it means promoting education, refining governance, nurturing the people, and benefiting all things—this is the benevolence of a sovereign. Wisdom does not mean petty scrutiny or surveillance; it means understanding principle and righteousness, discerning safety and danger, distinguishing the worthy from the foolish, and differentiating right from wrong—this is the wisdom of a sovereign. Martial prowess does not mean aggression or brutality; it means unwavering resolve where the Dao lies, imperviousness to the deceptions of the treacherous, and immovability before the flattery of sycophants—this is the martial prowess of a sovereign.

Your servant observes that Your Majesty governs with an open heart, maintaining a dignified and serene demeanor. When ministers present their proposals, you no longer inquire into their advantages and disadvantages or thoroughly examine their merits and flaws, but instead approve them all. I hope Your Majesty will expand your innate, boundless benevolence like the radiance of the sun and moon, and rouse the firm resolve of the *qian* hexagram, so that the prosperity of the Tang, Yu, and the Three Dynasties may not be far off.

The second memorial discussed the three pillars of good governance: appointing officials, ensuring trustworthy rewards, and enforcing inevitable punishments. The state values reputation over substance and punishes the letter of the law rather than the intent. If rewards are given based on reputation, the world will embellish their names to seek merit; if punishments are meted out based on legalistic formalities, the world will manipulate the law to evade guilt.

The third memorial addressed military selection, arguing that the art of maintaining an army lies in quality, not quantity. The emperor retained the first memorial for his personal consideration, sent the second to the Secretariat, and forwarded the third to the Bureau of Military Affairs. Guang also presented five admonitions: first, to preserve the legacy; second, to cherish time; third, to plan for the long term; fourth, to be vigilant in small matters; and fifth, to prioritize leniency. The emperor deeply accepted his counsel.

The record states: The late Master Zhu Xi said: "Wengong (Sima Guang) may be called a man of wisdom, benevolence, and courage. His governance was of the highest order, his vision broad. He was learned, stern, and upright. Alas!"

Observing Xi’s words, one sees that the remonstrances presented by the Remonstrance Bureau were indeed his own insights. The three virtues—wisdom, benevolence, and courage—are the gateway through which the sage enters the Dao. As for being free from sorrow, confusion, and fear, he never ceased to strive earnestly. Could Guang’s endowment from Heaven be anything but profound? Could his devotion to learning be anything but sincere? As for the three memorials and five admonitions, their implementation is but a matter of sequence, while the cultivation of the ruler’s virtue is the root. *The Doctrine of the Mean* does not say: "That by which they are practiced is one"? Thus, Guang’s preservation of sincerity had its source.

When Emperor Zhezong ascended the throne, Guang was appointed Left Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs. By then, he had already fallen ill, yet the Green Sprouts and Hired Service laws he had opposed remained in force, and the Western Xia had not yet submitted. Guang sighed, saying: "The four harms remain unremoved; I shall not close my eyes in death." He penned a brief note to Lord Lü, writing: "I entrust my person to the physicians, my family affairs to my foolish son, but the affairs of state have yet to be entrusted—today, I place them in your care."

Soon after, an edict excused him from court audiences and permitted him to be carried in a sedan chair, attending the ministry only once every three days. Guang dared not accept this, saying: "Without seeing the ruler, I cannot conduct affairs." The court ordered his son Kang to support him into the audience. When the Khitan heard of this, they instructed their border officials: "The Chinese have a minister—Minister Sima. Take care not to provoke incidents or open rifts along the frontier." At that time, the two courts humbled themselves in virtue, and Guang, seeing his words and plans consistently followed, sought to devote himself to the state like a watchdog, attending to every duty without rest, day or night.

Visitors, seeing his frail body, cautioned him with the example of Zhuge Liang—too little food for too many affairs. Guang replied: "Life and death are matters of fate." Though he redoubled his efforts, his illness worsened until he could no longer rise. Even then, his words remained earnest, as if spoken in a dream—yet all concerned the affairs of court and realm.

It is recorded: As Lü Xianke lay dying, he wrote by hand to entrust Minister Sima, saying: "The affairs of the realm may yet be saved—Junshi, I urge you to strive." As Minister Sima himself neared death, he sent a note to Lord Lü, saying: "The state’s affairs remain unentrusted—I now place them in your care." The upright ends of these two men were much alike, for their aspirations were one. The *Book of Changes* says: "The king’s ministers toil tirelessly, not for themselves." Thus did they labor to the utmost until their last breath. So long as a single breath remained, their devotion to the state allowed no slackening—how could their earnest words, like speech in a dream, be otherwise?

During the Xining era, the emperor, in response to calamities, withdrew to a secondary hall, reduced his meals, and silenced the music. Wang Anshi said to the emperor: "Disasters and omens are all matters of heavenly decree, unrelated to the success or failure of human affairs." Fu Bi, traveling on the road, heard this and sighed: "What the ruler fears is Heaven. If he fears not Heaven, what may he not do?" This must be the work of a treacherous man advancing perverse doctrines to sway the emperor’s heart, rendering the counsel of his ministers and remonstrators powerless. This is the pivot of order and chaos—it cannot be left unchecked. He immediately submitted a memorial of several thousand words, citing the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the *Great Plan*, and historical records both ancient and modern, along with human nature and the principles of things, to demonstrate why such claims were utterly untenable. When he entered to address the throne, he further said: "The advancement or retreat of gentlemen and petty men hinges upon whether the kingly Way is pleased or displeased. Your Majesty favors sending men to spy on external affairs, and so the treacherous and frugal thrive. Moreover, the governance of court and realm has gradually begun to change—this must be the work of petty men offering counsel to Your Majesty. Petty men, by nature, delight in action and stirring up trouble, for they harbor secret ambitions. If the court maintains stillness, affairs proceed by established laws—what then can petty men hope for?"

It is recorded: Though the emperor wavered and Fu Bi spoke forthrightly, it was like urging the deaf to listen or demanding sight from the blind. Yet such words were not discarded, for though times differ, principle never ceases. Heaven is not to be feared, but the principles of Heaven are. Men are not to be pitied, but the hearts of men must be. The whims of one man cannot be relied upon, but the sentiments of the hundred officials and myriad people can. The fleeting alignment of the moment cannot be trusted, but the judgments of all under Heaven and later ages can. To dismiss such counsel as futile and abandon it would plunge ten thousand generations into eternal night.

When Wang Anshi took office, all believed him the right man for the hour—only Lü Huai alone declared him unfit for the times. To employ him in great office would be unwise, he said, and sought to be transferred elsewhere. Sima Guang also attended the imperial lectures and privately asked what Lü had spoken of that day. Lü replied: "I have a memorial in my sleeve—it concerns the new appointee." Guang, startled, said: "All rejoice at having found the right man—why do you oppose him?" Lü said: "Do you, Junshi, also speak thus? This man may have some reputation, but he clings stubbornly to his own views, readily trusts the treacherous, and delights in flattery. His words sound fine at first, but when put into practice, they falter. If placed in the highest office, the realm will surely suffer his calamity." He then submitted a memorial stating: "The greatest treachery wears the guise of loyalty; the deepest deceit, the semblance of sincerity. Anshi outwardly appears rustic and unrefined, but inwardly harbors cunning and deceit. Arrogant and disdainful toward his superiors, secretly cruel and harmful to others—here I briefly recount over a dozen matters. I fear Your Majesty, pleased by his eloquence, may come to rely on him, and in time, his true nature will remain hidden. Once the path for great treachery is opened, the wicked will gather like water converging in a ravine, the worthy will be driven out, and chaos will arise. I privately grieve for this. He who will bring ruin to the black-haired masses is surely this man."

It is recorded: How can the words of a gentleman be taken lightly? "Outwardly rustic and unrefined, inwardly cunning and deceitful; arrogant and disdainful toward his superiors, secretly cruel and harmful to others"—these four phrases exhaust the depths of Anshi’s nature, which no one under Heaven for ten thousand generations can conceal. Yet what does it matter whether he was heeded or not, acted upon or not? If one merely praises Lü’s foresight, then Li Shizhong also foresaw this—not only Xianke. When Shizhong first served in the provinces and counties, a palace report announced that Bao Zheng had been appointed Assistant Minister. Some said the court would henceforth see much trouble. Shizhong said: "What can Lord Bao do? The magistrate of Yin County now—that is the man who will one day bring chaos to the realm." He referred to Wang Anshi, whose eyes had much white, much like Wang Shu. Twenty years later, his words proved true—indeed, he had foreseen it even before Lü Huai.

Fan Chunren memorialized: "Anshi extorts wealth and profit, unsettling the people’s hearts." The *Book of Documents* says: "Resentment—does it lie only in what is seen and not seen?" The emperor asked: "What is resentment that is not seen?" He replied: "It is what Du Mu called 'not daring to speak, but daring to be angry.'" The emperor said: "You discuss affairs well. For my sake, set forth the lessons of order and chaos from ancient and modern times that may serve as warnings." Thereupon, he composed the *Exegesis on the Book of Documents* and presented it, drawing on the deeds of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, King Wen, King Wu, and the Duke of Zhou. He said: "There is no better way to govern the realm than this. I wish to delve deeply into it and practice it with all my strength." When the equalized tax law was implemented in the six circuits, he again said: "I once personally received Your Majesty’s virtuous decree, desiring to restore the policies of the former kings to aid the people. Now, instead, you emulate Sang Hongyang’s equalized transport system, employing petty men to extort and oppress, provoking the people’s resentment and inviting disaster." Anshi, using the pretext of enriching the state and strengthening the military, had awakened the emperor’s ambitions, seeking quick results while forgetting his former learning. In matters of law, he invoked Shang Yang; in matters of wealth and profit, he turned his back on Mengzi.

The aged and decrepit had become mere followers of convention, casting aside public consensus as vulgar custom, branding those who differed as unworthy while praising those who aligned with their views as virtuous. His remonstrances went unheeded. Each time Chunren submitted memorials with fervent urgency, the emperor withheld them entirely from external circulation—until now, when they were all compiled and presented to the central administration.

Anshi flew into a rage and demanded severe demotion. The emperor replied: "He has committed no crime; let him be assigned to a favorable post." Thus, he was appointed Prefect of Hezhong. The record states: Of all the critiques against the New Policies, none have been as incisive as Chunren’s. And why did Mu’s words arise? For just as Qin employed Shang Yang, so too does this reign employ Shi; and just as Shi’s policies were put into effect, so too were Shang Yang’s doctrines extended. When he declared: "Those who discourse on the highest virtue do not conform to established custom; those who achieve great deeds do not consult the masses," this was precisely Shi’s obstinate inflexibility. And when he said: "Ordinary people are content with old customs, while scholars are drowned in received knowledge," this was precisely Shi’s defiance of the multitude to assert his singularity. Relentlessly pursuing profit, they bled the people’s essence and exhausted their strength—how could the people’s resentment not pour forth as if from their own mouths? Thus, applying Mu’s critique of Qin to Shi, we see that in the end, his policies gnawed at the state and betrayed the Dao, leaving the people joyless in life, and the disaster of barbarian invasion followed on its heels. How little does this differ from the path that doomed Qin! Alas, how lamentable!

At that time, prolonged drought and famine pressed heavily, with exactions harsh and urgent. Refugees from the northeast, carrying their young and elderly, clogged the roads—emaciated, sick, and sorrowful. With each gust of wind and sand, they stood exposed, their clothing in tatters. Even the city-dwellers resorted to mixing hemp, wheat bran, and chaff with rice to make gruel, supplementing it with tree bark and grass roots. Some, shackled in chains and carrying tiles, sold timber to repay official debts, their numbers unending.

When Zheng Xia, Judicial Officer of Guangzhou, was stationed at the Anshang Gate, he painted a scene of this suffering and submitted it with a memorial: "When Your Majesty campaigns south and north, all reports speak of triumphant victories. Yet no one has presented a painting depicting the people’s hardships—how parents, wives, and children can no longer protect one another, how they wander destitute, their lives in disarray. I have carefully observed the Anshang Gate and, though what I have depicted captures but a fraction of the reality, even this glimpse should move Your Majesty to tears—how much more so from a thousand *li* away? I implore Your Majesty to view my painting and act upon my words. If even a single day passes without heeding both, then execute me for the crime of deceiving the throne."

Upon receiving the memorial, the emperor pored over the painting again and again, sighing deeply. He tucked it into his sleeve and retired. That night, he lay awake, unable to sleep. The next day, he ordered the capital to suspend the *xingqian* tax, the Three Departments to investigate the *shiyi* system, the Ministry of Agriculture to open the Ever-Normal Granaries, and the Three Guards to prepare for the troops in Xihe. He also commanded the provinces to address the dispersal of people and resources. Thus, the Green Sprouts and Labor Service laws were temporarily halted, collections ceased, and the Square Fields and Baojia systems were abolished—eighteen measures in all. When the people heard this, they cheered and congratulated one another.

The knight-errant then took the biographies of Wei Zheng, Yao Chong, Song Jing, Li Linfu, and Lu Qi from the *Old Tang Book* and arranged them into two scrolls, inscribing them: *"The Upright Gentleman and the Wicked Knave."* Along the borders of the illustrations, he noted: *"Officials in Office."* Those who secretly aligned with Li Linfu yet turned against Chong and Jing were each categorized and presented in written form.

Censorate official Yang Zhongxin visited the knight-errant and said: "The Censorate remains silent, yet you persist in submitting memorials—this places the duty of remonstrance at the palace gate while leaving the Censorate empty of men." He drew from his sleeve two volumes of memorials by eminent ministers and handed them to the knight-errant, saying: "Let these aid the upright."

The record states: *"The gentleman’s thoughts do not exceed his station,"* yet the knight-errant may be said to have overstepped his. Speech may differ in approval or disdain, but the painting rests upon the truth of what is seen and heard. As for the knight-errant—would he refuse the post of *jianmen* to accept the duty of *jiantao*? His resolve is thus known, and his words are not reckless. The dead lie but a moment away, so he spares no effort to assist; the flames lick at his eyelashes, so why惜 his life? Yet the emperor, though sleepless, remained deluded and did not act. Why? In the end, the fragrance of Yingzhou endured for posterity, while the calamity of Bianzhou brought misery in its time. The gentleman must not reject even the humblest office to avert such fates.

During the reign of Emperor Huizong, Chen He served as *You Zhengyan*. Tong Guan, Huang Jingchen, and Lu Hang colluded in treachery. Chen declared: "This concerns the very survival of the state. I bear the duty of remonstrance—how can I remain silent?" He submitted a memorial impeaching Tong Guan for abusing his favor and wielding power. Before he could finish reading it, the emperor rose abruptly, brushing off his robe. Chen grasped the emperor’s sleeve to plead for the chance to complete his speech, tearing the garment. The emperor said: "The *Zhengyan* has torn my robe." Chen replied: "Your Majesty does not惜 this torn robe—how could I惜 a shattered skull? These men now enjoy wealth and honor, but Your Majesty will one day face ruin." His words grew ever more urgent. The emperor’s expression shifted as he said: "If you can speak thus, what should I fear?" The eunuchs urged the emperor to change his robe, but he refused, saying: "Keep it to honor this forthright minister."

The record states: One has heard of mending a torn garment, but never of tearing the emperor’s robe. Is this not worthy of record? The disasters of the Song began with Wang Anshi and Lü Huishu and ended with Tong Guan and Wang Fu. By then, the realm lay shattered, and even a minister like Zhong Shanfu could find no remedy.

Li Ruoshui served as *Shilang* of the Ministry of Rites. When Emperor Qinzong was summoned again, the Jin army forced the emperor to change his robes. Li embraced him, weeping, and reviled the invaders as "dog barbarians." The Jin soldiers dragged him out and flung him to the ground. The Khitan commander Hemo shouted: "Ensure the *Shilang* comes to no harm!" Li refused all food. Some urged him: "There is nothing to be done. Submit today, and tomorrow you will have wealth and rank." He sighed: "Heaven has no two suns—how could I serve two masters?" His servant also tried to console him: "Your parents are advanced in years. If you yield even slightly, you might return to see them." Li rebuked him: "I have put my family aside. A loyal minister serves his lord with death, not divided loyalty. But my parents are elderly—I fear they will be alarmed, so I will write to reassure them." When the discussion turned to establishing a puppet regime, Zhang Bangchang summoned Li to discuss matters. Li cursed him roundly, and the Jin overseer struck him, splitting his lips, tearing his throat, and severing his tongue before he died at thirty-five. The Jin remarked among themselves: "When the Liao fell, a dozen men died for righteousness. In the Southern Court, only *Shilang* Li stands alone."

Liu Ge served as *Zizhengdian Xueshi*. When the Jin entered Zhen Ding, the elders wailed: "Had *Zizheng* Liu been here, how could this calamity have befallen our town?" The Jin, hearing his name, insisted on seizing him. When the capital fell, he was taken to the Jin camp. The Jin chancellor Han Zheng lodged him at Shousheng Monastery south of the city, saying: "The chancellor knows you. Now we will employ you." Liu replied: "To live in shame and serve two dynasties—I will not do it." Han said: "The army intends to establish a ruler of another surname. We wish to make you *Shangshu*. The chancellor may take his family with him. To die with your followers is less than going north for wealth and rank." Liu looked to the heavens and cried: "Is this so?" He returned home with a slip of paper recounting the matter and sent a kinsman to deliver it to his son. Liu Yu and the others bathed, changed into fresh clothes, poured a cup of wine, and hanged themselves. The Jin marveled at his loyalty and buried him on a hill south of the temple. Eighty days later, when they exhumed him, his complexion remained as in life.

The record states: The *Shilang* of the Southern Court and the *Zizheng* of Zhen Ding—even today, the people praise them. Compared to Bangchang and Liu Yu, they are as far removed as spittle cast aside. What need is there to speak of them further?

*Hongdao Lu*, Scroll Fifteen, concludes.
*Hongdao Lu*, Scroll Sixteen: *Righteousness*.

"The Righteousness of Ruler and Minister"

In the first year of the *Shaoxing* reign of Emperor Gaozong, Li Gang was summoned to serve as *You Chengxiang* (Right Grand Councilor). He submitted a memorial stating: "A sovereign who revives a fallen state and restores order must be of heroic wisdom to be equal to the task. Only with heroism can one’s resolve be firm enough to oversee great affairs without being swayed by petty concerns. Only with wisdom can one’s perception of virtue be clear enough to employ the noble without being misled by the base. In former times, rulers who embodied this Dao were none other than Emperor Gao and Emperor Guangwu of Han, Emperor Taizong of Tang, and our dynasty’s Emperor Taizu and Emperor Taizong. May Your Majesty take them as models."

The record states: In speaking of heroic wisdom, did Li Gang not have grounds for his words? Observing the emperor’s early conduct—when the northern tribes were still rampant, he boldly requested to go forth himself—this could be called heroic. Later, in a moment of crisis, he stabilized the precarious succession—this could be called wise. Alas, the mediocre nature of the sovereign became mired in ease and comfort, while the emperor’s attendants were content with mere expediency. Though Li Gang’s worth was evident, his talents could not be fully employed; though generals like Zhang, Han, Liu, and Yue stood ready, their achievements could not be completed. Thus, petty men like Wang Huang and Qin Hui concealed their true intentions and indulged their desires without restraint, unaware that the spirits of the illustrious rulers of Han and Tang had long since been buried beneath the earth. Who could say Li Gang lacked foresight?

Upon arriving at the imperial refuge, Li Gang memorialized: "The Jin act without principle, relying solely on deceit and stratagem to prevail. China, failing to perceive this, has fallen entirely into their schemes. Yet, by the grace of Heaven, the Mandate has not yet changed. Your Majesty now commands the armies in the field, upheld by the ministers and people of the realm. To cultivate virtue within and repel the enemy without, to restore the Two Sacred Ones and pacify the myriad states—this responsibility rests with Your Majesty and your chief minister." He then humbly declared: "In my own estimation, I am lacking and unworthy of such a weighty commission. I humbly beg that the appointment be revoked." The emperor replied: "I have long known of your loyalty, righteousness, wisdom, and resourcefulness. Do not decline."

Li Gang kowtowed in tears to express his gratitude, then said: "When the Tang Emperor Minghuang sought to appoint Yao Chong as his chief minister, Yao presented ten conditions, each addressing the ills of the time. Now, I too venture to lay ten proposals before Your Majesty’s celestial hearing. Should Your Majesty deem any of them feasible and grant their implementation, I shall then dare to accept the commission.

First, to deliberate on the state’s fundamental policies;
second, to deliberate on the imperial progress;
third, to deliberate on amnesties;
fourth, to deliberate on usurpation and rebellion;
fifth, to deliberate on false mandates;
sixth, to deliberate on warfare;
seventh, to deliberate on defense;
eighth, to deliberate on governance at its root;
ninth, to deliberate on long-term appointments;
tenth, to deliberate on the cultivation of virtue.

The following day, these proposals were presented for discussion in court. Only the matters of usurpation, rebellion, and false mandates were withheld from public decree.

Alas! Emperor Gaozong of Song was not one with whom great deeds could be accomplished. To firmly establish authority, one must first clearly identify the enemy—this was the grand strategy of Emperor Gao of Han. To execute Wei and slay Guan in pursuit of restoration was also the heroic valor of Emperor Xuan of Tang. The enmity of the Song house, though not immediately reversible, should not have been met with leniency toward the likes of Zhang Bangchang. His crimes reached to Heaven; his filth defiled our altars, his stench polluted our court. Even if we were to trace his every evil, the very dogs and fowl would find him intolerable—why then spare him our blade? Among these ten proposals, this was the most critical, for it concerned the hierarchy of ruler and subject and the very foundation of the people’s moral order. Yet the emperor concealed it and took no action. What more need one say of his timidity and failure to rule?

Though Li Gang contested fiercely, he could do no more than resign in protest, never having publicly denounced the traitor’s crimes before the realm. Soon after, Liu Yu followed the same path, brazenly enthroning himself and ordering his son to invade the Song. How different this was from the executions of Wei and the destruction of Xiang! This is why the Southern Song ultimately met its demise.

Li Gang further stated: 'Though the current state of the realm is no worse than during the Jingkang era, there remains hope. If Your Majesty exercises resolute judgment from above while ministers foster harmony below, the corruptions of Jingkang may yet be rectified, and restoration achieved. Yet without a clear vision and an understanding of priorities and urgency, success will remain elusive.

Externally, we must resist the powerful enemy; internally, we must suppress bandits and rebels. We must reform military governance, transform the spirit of the soldiery, enrich the state’s coffers, ease the people’s burdens, amend corrupt laws, reduce superfluous offices, issue sincere decrees to move the people’s hearts, and enforce rewards and punishments to rouse the troops’ morale. We must select capable generals to command the frontiers and choose supervisory officials and prefectural governors to implement the new policies. Only when our own house is in order can we then punish the Jin and welcome back the Two Emperors. This is what I mean by a grand design.

As for immediate priorities, the first must be the management of Hebei and Hedong. These regions are the nation’s shield. Once they are stabilized, the Central Plains can be secured, and the southeast pacified. In Hedong, the lost territories include Heng, Dai, Taiyuan, Ze, and Zezhou, while the remaining prefectures remain under our control. In Hebei, only Zhen, Huai, Wei, and Xun have been lost; over twenty other prefectures are still held by the court. The people, soldiers, and generals of both circuits remain steadfastly loyal to the Song, rallying under local heroes—some leading tens of thousands, others no fewer than ten thousand. If the court does not seize this moment to establish administrative offices, dispatch envoys to console and reassure them, and send troops to relieve their distress, I fear that with supplies exhausted and strength depleted, they will succumb to the Jin’s encirclement. Though their hearts remain loyal, if no aid arrives and they are left desperate and unheard, they may grow resentful toward the court. The Jin, seizing the opportunity, will then win them over—these are all elite troops.

It would be far better to establish a Pacification Office in Hebei and an Administration Office in Hedong, appointing men of talent and strategy to serve as envoys. They should proclaim the emperor’s benevolence and the court’s unwillingness to abandon the Two Rivers to the enemy. Those who preserve a prefecture or recover a commandery should be granted titles such as *jiedushi*, *fangyushi*, or *tuanlianshi*, following the Tang system of regional military governors, enabling them to defend themselves. This would not only sever their inclination to side with the enemy but also harness their strength to resist. This is the most urgent task of the moment.'

The emperor approved his words and asked whom he might appoint. Li Gang recommended Zhang Suo and Fu Liang. Alas! Observing the discussions on the Two Rivers and the establishment of the Administration and Campaign Offices, the revival of the Song seemed within reach. That a southerner like Li Gang should uphold such towering righteousness, transcending the prevailing winds—was this not a great turning point? Yet before long, Huang Qianshan and Wang Boyan forcibly ousted Li Gang, and the Pacification and Administration Offices were abolished. The imperial carriage hastened eastward, and the prefectures and counties of the Two Rivers fell one after another. All of Li Gang’s planned military and civil policies were discarded, the Jin grew ever stronger, the Guanzhong region lay in ruins, bandits swarmed the Central Plains, and the state became irredeemable.

Zong Ze memorialized: 'The realm belongs to the Great Ancestor. Your Majesty, with reverent diligence, seeks to transmit it to ten thousand generations—how then can you so readily discuss ceding the east and west of the Yellow River, or even the regions of Pu and Jie? Since the Jin’s second invasion, the court has not dispatched a single general or soldier. Instead, we hear only of treacherous ministers, who in the morning propose peace talks and by evening beg for alliances, until the Two Emperors were carried north and the ancestral temples disgraced. I had thought Your Majesty would rise in righteous fury, openly denounce and punish the traitors, and thus restore the royal house. Yet since your enthronement, no grand decrees have been issued—only a directive from the Ministry of Justice forbidding the public proclamation of amnesties in the east and west of the Yellow River or in Pu and Jie of Shaanxi. This strips the loyal and righteous of their resolve and severs the bond between ruler and people. Though I am weak and cowardly, I would charge ahead of the generals, arrows and stones be damned, and lay down my life to repay the state—what more could I ask?'"

The Emperor read his words and was struck by their valor. At that time, the position of Prefect of Kaifeng was vacant. Li Gang argued that the restoration of the old realm could not be achieved without [Zhao] Ze, and so he was appointed Military Commissioner of the Eastern Capital and Prefect of Kaifeng. Ze then submitted another memorial, stating: "In Kaifeng, market prices and shops have gradually returned to normal. Soldiers, farmers, merchants, and scholar-officials who cherish loyalty and righteousness all wish for Your Majesty to swiftly return to the capital to console the people’s hearts. Those who advocate dissenting opinions do not offer loyal counsel to Your Majesty but merely collude with the likes of Zhang Bangchang, secretly aligning with the Jin for their own gain."

At that time, the regions of Zhen, Ding, Huai, and Wei were heavily occupied by enemy forces, who were covertly preparing for battle and devising plans for invasion. Ze crossed the Yellow River to confer with the generals and discuss strategies for recovery. Within the capital, he stationed commanders on all four sides to oversee the recruitment of troops and constructed twelve hundred war chariots. He also established twenty-four fortified strongholds outside the city based on strategic terrain, garrisoning tens of thousands of soldiers. Ze personally inspected and drilled them, while along the river, he arranged defenses in a continuous, interlocking formation, linking the loyal militia of the eastern and northern regions with the mountains and waters. As a result, the armies of Shaanxi and the eastern and western circuits of the capital all wished to be placed under Ze’s command.

Ze repeatedly memorialized the throne, urging the Emperor to return to the capital. However, the Emperor followed the counsel of Huang Qianshan and resolved to flee southeast. The chronicler notes: The essence of Ze’s two memorials aligned with Li Gang’s. For the realm’s situation is such that one either advances or retreats. To advance would not only preserve the old borders but also reclaim lost territory, avenge humiliation, and restore honor. To retreat would not only forfeit Hebei and Hedong but also render Henan beyond recovery. Not only Henan, but even the Huai region would fall into chaos. Retreat across the Yangtze, or further by sea—such consequences would be inevitable. This was the depth of Ze’s grief and indignation, which would not cease until his death. Alas! Could the crimes of Wang [Boyan] and Huang [Qianshan] ever be adequately punished? This was the first of Emperor Gaozong’s lifelong regrets.

In the winter of the fourth year of the Jianyan era, the tenth month, an edict ordered Han Shizhong to advance to Yangzhou. Upon receiving the command, Shizhong wept with emotion and declared, "With the sovereign in such distress, how can a subject live on?" He personally led his cavalry to confront the enemy, felling trees to build palisades and cutting off his own retreat. As he marched, the court dispatched Wei Liangchen as an envoy to the Jin camp. Shizhong deceived Liangchen by claiming the edict ordered him to shift his forces to guard the river. Once Liangchen departed, Shizhong mounted his horse and commanded his troops, "Follow where my whip points." He then moved his army toward Dayi, arraying five battle formations and setting over twenty ambushes.

When Liangchen reached the Jin forces, the Jin inquired about the movements of the Song army, and he relayed the false report of the relocation. Nie’er Bodong, upon hearing this, rejoiced and led his troops to the riverbank, halting five *li* from Dayi. Another Jin general, Tiebuye, advanced with armored cavalry through the five Song formations from the east. Shizhong signaled with a small banner and sounded the drums; ambushes sprang up on all sides. The Song banners intermingled with those of the Jin, throwing the enemy into confusion as the Song forces pressed forward. Shizhong ordered his "Ghost Soldiers" to wield long axes, striking at the enemy’s chests above and severing their horses’ legs below. The Jin, clad in heavy armor, became mired in the mud. Shizhong then directed his elite cavalry to trample them from all sides, slaughtering men and horses alike. He captured over two hundred prisoners, including Tiebuye. Meanwhile, Shizhong’s subordinate Dong Ying also defeated the Jin at Yamouth Bridge in Tianchang.

Xie Yuan, reaching the north gate of Gaoyou, encountered an enemy ambush. His naval forces engaged in thirteen battles along the river in a single day, holding their ground without yielding. Shizhong dispatched Cheng Min with cavalry to reinforce them, and another fierce battle ensued, resulting in many captives. Shizhong then personally pursued the fleeing Jin to the Huai River, where the enemy panicked and stampeded, many drowning in the chaos. When news of the victory reached the court, officials entered to offer congratulations. The Emperor declared, "Shizhong’s loyalty and bravery are such that I knew he would succeed." Shen Yuqiu remarked, "Since the Jianyan era began, our generals have never engaged the Jin in battle. Now, with Shizhong’s successive victories, his achievements are no small matter. This campaign stands as the foremost military triumph of our time."

Later, when the Emperor personally led his forces to resist the Jin, halting at Pingjiang Prefecture, the combined forces of the Jin and Qi pressed close. Court officials urged the Emperor to flee elsewhere to evade them.

Zhang Jun said, "Where could we flee to? Only by advancing to command the army ourselves can we avoid disaster." Zhao Ding remarked, "If we fight and do not prevail, retreat will not come too late." The Emperor then declared, "For the Two Sacred Ones, still held afar, I have already sought peace, yet they persist in violence and oppression. I shall personally lead the Six Armies to the Yangtze and engage them in battle." Shen Yuqiu again strongly endorsed Zhao Ding’s counsel, adding with delight, "Years of retreat and timidity have only emboldened the enemy. Now, with Your Majesty’s resolute decision to lead the campaign, the officers and soldiers will surely rise to the occasion—success is assured. I humbly offer my meager talents to devise strategies for the nation’s sake."

When Zhang Jun inspected the troops at Zhenjiang, he met Zhao Ding and grasped his hand, saying, "Every move in this campaign aligns with the people’s will." Zhao Ding smiled and replied, "This is Yu Zicai’s achievement." An edict then appointed Zhang Jun as Commissioner of the Bureau of Military Affairs. Upon receiving the command, he immediately set out for the Yangtze to oversee the forces. At that time, Tahan Wumu amassed a hundred thousand troops, vowing to cross the Yangtze and fight. Zhang Jun advanced swiftly to the riverbank, summoning Liu Guangshi, Han Shizhong, and Zhang Jun to council. The officers, witnessing his bold spirit, were tenfold emboldened. After organizing the troops and assigning commands, Zhang Jun remained in Zhenjiang to direct operations.

Yue Fei, stationed in Jiankang, repeatedly presented the Emperor with strategies for reclaiming lost territories, stating, "The reason the Jin installed Liu Yu in the Central Plains was to ravage the region, using Chinese to attack Chinese, allowing them to rest their troops and watch for opportunities. If Your Majesty grants me but a few months, I shall lead my forces to Jing and Luo, seize Heyang, Shanfu, and Tong Pass, and rally the rebel generals of the Five Routes. Once these rebels return to allegiance, I will dispatch the imperial armies forward. The enemy will surely abandon Bian and flee north of the Yellow River, allowing us to recover the capital region and the lands west of Shaan. Then, dividing our forces to dredge Hua and Hua, we shall reclaim the Two Rivers. Thus, Liu Yu can be captured, and the Jin destroyed. This is the enduring plan for the dynasty’s restoration."

The Emperor replied, "...With such ministers, what need have I to worry about the timing of advance or retreat? I shall not interfere." He then summoned Yue Fei to his private chambers and commanded, "The task of reviving the dynasty I entrust entirely to you." Yue Fei thus prepared for a grand campaign.

**Record:** In my humble view, Yue Fei’s words reflected his true capabilities, not empty boasts to deceive. When he crushed Yang Mo, pitting water bandits against water bandits, his swift success proved his skill. Now, using rebel generals to subdue rebel ministers—would this not be even easier? Had the Emperor followed through on his words, entrusting the restoration entirely to Yue Fei, his far-sighted plans would have borne fruit in no time. Yet he was thwarted by the treacherous Qin Hui. When Yue Fei requested to report to the Supreme Commander, how could Qin Hui not have known of Zhang Jun’s enmity? Yet he ultimately obstructed and demoralized Yue Fei, and by the time Yue Fei sought to act again, it was too late. Though Qin Hui’s jealousy was despicable, was this not also a case of Heaven thwarting success? This was the second of Emperor Gaozong’s great regrets.

At that time, Liang Xing, leader of the Loyal and Righteous Society of the Taihang Mountains, along with heroes from the Two Rivers, led their followers to join Yue Fei. Thus, the Jin’s every move and the lay of the land’s strategic points were known to him. From the Central Plains to the borders of Ci, Xiang, Ze, Di, Jin, Fenyang, and Wei, all awaited his arrival, their troops converging with the imperial forces, raising banners emblazoned with "Yue." Elders and common folk vied to pull carts and lead oxen, laden with grain to support the righteous army. Those bearing incense basins to welcome them lined the roads. South of Yan, the Jin’s commands held no sway. When Wumu sought to rally his forces against Yue Fei, not a single man in Hebei responded. He sighed, "Since I rose in the north, I have never suffered such a setback."

Jin generals Wang Zhen, Cui Qing, Li Ji, Cui Hu, and Hua Wang, along with their troops, surrendered to Yue Fei. The generals of the Dragon-Tiger Prince, including Chi Zha, secretly received Yue Fei’s banners and defected from their kingdom. Han Chang also sought to submit with fifty thousand men. Yue Fei rejoiced and told his officers, "We shall march straight to Huanglongfu and drink deeply with all of you!" He then memorialized the throne: "As Xing and others cross the river, the people’s hearts turn toward the court. The Jin, repeatedly defeated, have ordered the old and young to flee north—this is the perfect moment for restoration!"

Yet Qin Hui, intent on ceding all lands north of the Huai to the Jin in a peace settlement, incited court officials to petition for the generals’ withdrawal. Knowing Yue Fei’s resolve could not be swayed, he memorialized, "Yue Fei’s isolated army cannot remain long; I beg you to recall him swiftly." Thus, in a single day, Yue Fei received twelve golden tablets. Grieving and weeping, he bound his hair, bowed twice, and said, "A decade’s effort is undone in an instant."

**Record:** In my humble view, during Emperor Gaozong’s reign, there were three opportunities for action. At the beginning of the Jianyan era, the Hebei region had not yet rebelled, and the people’s hearts had not yet turned away. Li Gang was at court, and Zong Ze was in the field. At that time, defense could have secured the realm, and offense could have reclaimed lost lands—restoration was within reach. The second opportunity came when the generals achieved victories, the Emperor personally led the armies to the Yangtze, and Zhao Ding and Zhang Jun governed, enacting policies and appointing officials in due order. Thus, key positions were filled with men of the hour, earning the era the name "Little Yuan You." The third came at the end, when the Jin were defeated at Yancheng, Zhuxian, and Shunchang, and south of Yan, their commands held no sway. Wumu sighed, "Since I took up arms, I have never faced such a day." Yue Fei, overjoyed, declared, "We shall march straight to Huanglongfu and drink deeply with all of you!" What a moment of promise! Yet the Emperor’s true desire was not the return of the Two Emperors, fearing it would threaten his position. He thus deferred to the machinations of treacherous ministers.

Thus, before the cunning hare and soaring crow were slain, he had already devised schemes to boil the hounds and store the bows. The great affairs of the realm were lost from that moment. For this reason, I have recorded the deeds of the generals in full above and now offer this comprehensive assessment, that it may serve as a warning for all ages.

Yue Fei was resolute and impassioned, ever fixed on reclaiming the Central Plains and capturing the cunning foe. He lived with great austerity. In his youth, he could drink several *dou* of wine, but the Emperor cautioned him, "When you reach the banks of the Yellow River, then you may drink." From that day, he never touched wine again. His household had no concubines; Wu Zhu, admiring his virtue, adorned his younger sister and offered her to him. Yue Fei refused, saying, "The Emperor lies awake with worry—how can a general indulge in pleasure?" Wu Zhu only revered him more. When the Emperor wished to build him a mansion, he declined, "While the Jin barbarians remain unvanquished, how can I think of a home?"

Someone once asked, "When will the realm know peace?" Yue Fei replied, "When civil officials do not love wealth, and military officers do not fear death, the realm will know peace." If a soldier took so much as a thread or a bundle of straw from the people, he would execute them on the spot. When he lodged among the common folk, though they opened their doors in welcome, none dared let him enter. He was called "the one who would not dismantle a roof to stay warm, nor plunder to stave off hunger." If his soldiers fell ill, he personally prepared their medicine. When his generals were stationed far away, he sent his wife to inquire after their families. For those who died in service, he wept and raised their orphans, sometimes even marrying his own sons to their daughters. Whatever rewards or provisions were bestowed, he distributed equally among his officers and men, keeping nothing for himself.

Skilled in defeating the many with the few, he would summon all his commanders to deliberate before any campaign. Once the strategy was set, they fought—never losing, only winning. So steadfast was his army that the enemy said, "Shaking a mountain is easy; shaking Yue’s army is hard." When Zhang Jun once asked the key to warfare, he replied, "Benevolence, trust, wisdom, courage, and discipline—none can be lacking."

He honored the worthy and treated scholars with courtesy. He read the classics and histories, composed refined poetry, and played *touhu* with the demeanor of a scholar. Whenever he declined honors, he would say, "The soldiers have done the work—what merit is mine?" His loyalty burned fiercely, his principles unyielding, never bending to others. In the end, this brought him ruin. For Yue Fei and Qin Hui could not coexist.

**Record:** In my view, Yue Wu Mu stands peerless. Why? Among the great generals of old—Sun, Wu, Han, Peng, Ying, Wei, Li, Guo—few can be counted. Yet Sun betrayed his friend, Wu killed his wife, Han usurped the throne, Ying abandoned his lord, Wei wallowed in extravagance—none bear scrutiny. In recent times, Zhang Wei Gong suffered defeat at Fuping, Han Jun Wang fled at the Yangtze, Zhang Bo Ying’s heart wavered, Liu Ping Shu’s command was lawless—only Wu Mu remained steadfast.

He honored Zhou Tong as a true friend, refused Wu Zhu’s sister to avoid lust, and tended his mother’s illness with his own hands—filial devotion. The banner inscribed with "Utmost Loyalty" and the tattoo "Serve the Nation" marked his devotion to the throne. His virtues were rooted in nature, and in every matter, he never forgot loyalty and filial piety—true integrity. In command, he mastered all five virtues, fought a hundred battles without defeat, and cherished the people’s strength, never taking so much as a thread. Compared to the ancients, he was the equal of Fang Shu and Ji Fu, yet fate denied him the chance to restore the glory of King Xuan. Heaven did not bless the Song—one cannot merely blame the sovereign and his ministers.

Hu Quan submitted a memorial: "I have examined Wang Lun—a base and deceitful man, a rogue from the marketplace. A shortsighted prime minister sent him as an envoy to the Jin, where he resorted to lies and deception, deluding the imperial ear. Now, without cause, he lures the Jin envoys under the pretext of 'instructing the south'—this is to make us their servants, to reduce us to the likes of Liu Yu. The realm belongs to the ancestors, and the throne Your Majesty occupies is theirs. How can you surrender the ancestors’ realm to the barbarians, their throne to the barbarians? If Your Majesty bows the knee, the spirits of the ancestral temples will be defiled, the people of the Central Plains will don foreign robes, the court’s ministers will become vassals, and the empire’s scholars will tear their caps and destroy their sashes, forced into barbarian dress.

Even if the Jin could be trusted, how will history judge Your Majesty? The Jin are treacherous, and Wang Lun aids their deceit. The imperial coffins cannot return, the Empress Dowager cannot be restored, Emperor Qianshu cannot be rescued, and the Central Plains cannot be reclaimed. Once this knee is bent, it cannot be straightened again—this is cause for bitter tears and endless sighs. Before, when the realm teetered like stacked eggs, Your Majesty refused to bow to the barbarians. Now, with the state’s fortunes slightly improved—victories at Xiangyang, the Huai, and Wo Kou, far surpassing past defeats—why suddenly submit? To humble the Son of Heaven and bow to a barbarian tent? This is why Lu Lian refused to serve Qin—not for empty prestige, but because the fate of the realm could not permit it.

Within the court and without, officials and soldiers, the people with one voice demand Wang Lun’s flesh. I say: if Wang Lun is not executed, the survival of the state is uncertain. Yet Wang Lun is beneath contempt—it is Qin Hui, the trusted minister, who enables him. Your Majesty possesses the virtues of Yao and Shun, yet Qin Hui cannot guide you to the heights of Tang and Yu but instead leads you to the shame of Shi Jing Tang. Sun Jin echoes his words, gaining office as a counselor. When Qin Hui says 'peace is possible,' Sun Jin agrees; when Qin Hui says 'we must bow,' Sun Jin concurs. I say: Qin Hui and Sun Jin should both be executed."

"I, though but a humble member of the privy council, hold these men as mortal enemies with whom I cannot share the sky. My humble wish is to sever the heads of these three, impale them on poles, and display them in the streets. Then, detain the barbarian envoys, reproach them for their insolence, and in due course raise an army to punish their crimes—thus shall the soldiers of our three armies find their qi redoubled without even engaging in battle. Otherwise, I would sooner cast myself into the eastern sea and die than live on in this diminished court, begging for survival.

**Record states:** This memorial is like the biting frost and scorching sun—nothing less than the upright qi of Heaven and Earth. Even a hundred generations hence, should one recite it but once, the awe of Dan’an’s presence would still linger before their eyes. How much more, then, in that moment, when the treacherous ministers and shameless barbarians must have had their qi shaken and their resolve broken! Only then does one realize that the words of a noble man shine as brightly as the sun and moon, endure as long as Heaven and Earth, and their merit is no small contribution. Though the Jin’s million-strong army was repelled, and the Middle Kingdom’s sigh of ‘we still have men’ was deepened, even after a hundred humiliations, that which is greatest and most unyielding, filling the space between Heaven and Earth, cannot be erased. Was this not the greatest triumph of the Southern Court in two hundred years!

In the seventh year of Emperor Lizong’s *Longxing* reign, Liu Hong was recalled to serve as Pacification Commissioner of Jing and Xiang. He declined the appointment and submitted a memorial, saying: 'Jing and Xiang are the limbs; the court is the vital qi of the heart and viscera. When the vital qi is strong, the limbs grow robust. If the court’s governance is sound and its root and foundation flourishing, then the strategic interests of Jing and Xiang may be gradually secured. I beg first to discuss the great strategy of the state, and only then address the substance of its foundation.

What is this great strategy? It is *recovery*—the restoration of lost lands. I say that today we possess its form but not yet its substance. Generally speaking, to have substance without form is to settle on a plan and achieve success before the enemy realizes it; to have form without substance is to invite disaster and summon invaders without the means to resist them. King Zhao of Yan and Zhuge Liang of Han—these were men of substance without form. The barbarians cannot forget us, just as we cannot forget them. For years, there have been no alarms at the frontier, for they too have learned from Wanyan Liang’s reckless incursions and now seek a strategy of absolute security. Yet now, before our troops have even moved, our intentions are already known; before our strength is gathered, our posturing is already visible. This teaches the barbarians to plot deeply against us and prepare rigorously for us. I grieve over this.

What, then, is the substance of self-cultivation? It is to seek worthy men, to relieve the people’s suffering, to employ capable generals, and to nurture the army."

King Xuan of Zhou employed the worthy and entrusted the capable, pitying widows and orphans. The tasks of gathering ferns, commanding chariots, leading assaults, and managing governance—these four alone encompassed all major affairs. The foundation of order and peace does not lie in rewards, punishments, or proclamations, but in the person of the ruler. The goodness or evil of the ruler resides in a single thought; when such thoughts accumulate and settle within the heart, then good becomes clearly visible, and right and wrong stand distinctly before him.

Your Majesty has reigned for nine years now. There are matters once deemed right that are now wrong, and men once deemed worthy who have since declined. I urge you to set aside your own views and adopt the views of the realm as your own, to abandon your own wisdom and embrace the wisdom of the multitude. If you wish to summon true worthies of this age, you must first endure the forthright air of upright ministers. If flatterers and sycophants are not wholly expelled, the straight path cannot be walked, and such men will retreat into the mountains and forests, beyond reach and use.

As for the decline of scholar-officials’ mores, it is especially lamentable. Those who spout grand, empty words, currying favor with the throne, are rewarded with extraordinary favor if great, or at least stolen affection if small. Some even rely on shadowy connections, suppressing dissent, stifling the spirit of loyalty, and blocking all knowledge of harm and benefit—this is not yet the full reality of seeking the worthy.

Today, though there are officials charged with nurturing the people, they cannot fulfill their duties. Driven by fiscal demands and pressed by superiors, they advance through reprimands and punishments, devising clever pretexts for exactions and issuing documents to hound the people. As for the work of laboring to settle the displaced, easing hardship, and pacifying the weary—no such men are to be seen. This is not yet the full reality of relieving the people’s suffering.

As for generals, those who enrich themselves while impoverishing others and fawn on superiors should indeed be expelled. Yet many newly promoted are pampered sons of privilege, untested in battle, and in times of crisis, I fear they will fail to meet the enemy. This is not yet the full reality of employing capable generals.

In ancient times, nurturing soldiers included the joy of pushing carts and drinking coarse wine, the vigor of hurling stones and leaping distances. Thus, they were brave in the public cause, roused at the sound of the enemy, and fought fiercely for their lord. Generals showed kindness like the gift of a coat, compassion like sucking poison from a wound, loving their men as sons and brothers, and wielding them as their own limbs.

Now, it is not so. Soldiers are exploited, overworked, and driven to exhaustion. Thus, when new recruits are sought, none answer the call. Recently, I heard of cavalry being relocated to Jiankang, and along the roads, sorrowful sighs spread in all directions, breeding resentment among the living, grievances among the dead, and sapping the courage of the three armies. This is not yet the full reality of nurturing the army.

With the people impoverished, resources depleted, soldiers resentful, and generals arrogant, bandits and rebels will surely rise within the realm. Yet you would still clash swords in the north at Yiwu—this is what I cannot comprehend.

The record states: I observe that the words of the loyal and solemn are like the counsel of the late Song, reviving the declining winds of mediocre rulers and correcting the long-standing abuses of the Six Tombs—not merely to admonish Xiaozong. In time, if the primal qi is not secured and the four limbs wither, the great mandate will swiftly depart.

As for the precedents of military campaigns, high ministers and chief councilors often exploit them to seize great office and cling to great power. Without ministers of unyielding integrity or scions of divine wisdom, who could refuse seven summonses and decline seven times? Thus, I record this to fulfill the meaning of overturning the incense burner and the resolve to punish the rebels. Beyond this, all is but a day of endless sighs. Alas!

In his youth, Wen Tianxiang saw the portraits of the local worthies enshrined in the school temple—Ouyang Xiu, Yang Bangyou, and Hu Quan—all men of unwavering loyalty and integrity. He admired them deeply and declared, "To die without being honored with offerings of grain and meat is no true man." At twenty, he passed the imperial examinations. During the policy debate, Emperor Lizong had reigned for many years, and governance had gradually stagnated. Wen responded with the principle of "emulating Heaven’s ceaselessness," his words numbering over ten thousand, composed in a single flourish. The emperor selected him as first place. The examiner, Wang Yinglin, memorialized: "His ancient righteousness is like a mirror of antiquity; his loyal heart is as unyielding as iron and stone. Your servant dares to congratulate Your Majesty on finding such a man."

In the ninth year of Xianchun, Wen was appointed as the judicial commissioner of Hunan. There, he met the former chief councilor Jiang Wanli, who had long marveled at Wen’s resolve and character. When they spoke of state affairs, Jiang sighed mournfully: "I am old. The burden of the world’s course now rests with you." At the beginning of Deyou, an edict was issued calling the realm to arms in defense of the emperor. Wen Tianxiang, clutching the decree, wept bitterly. He dispatched Chen Jizhou to rally the valiant men of the prefecture and unite the tribal leaders of the mountain streams, amassing a force of ten thousand. His friends sought to dissuade him. Wen replied: "I know this well. Yet the state has nurtured its people for over two hundred years. Now, on the day of crisis, when troops are summoned from across the land, not a single man or horse has entered the passes. This is my deepest sorrow. Thus, though I know my strength is insufficient, I offer myself as a hound or a sacrificial beast, hoping that loyal ministers and righteous scholars throughout the realm may rise upon hearing of it. If righteousness prevails, if plans are laid and men gathered, and if success is thus achieved, then the altars of the state may yet be preserved." The Prince of Yi summoned him to Fuzhou with the title of *Guangwen Dian Xueshi*, appointing him as Right Chancellor. When the Prince of Wei succeeded to the throne, Wen was further honored as *Shaobao* and enfeoffed as the Duke of Xinguo.

After the fall of Yashan, Wen was taken to the capital. At the time, Emperor Shizu sought talented men, and the southern official Wang Jixi declared that no southerner surpassed Wen Tianxiang. The emperor dispatched Wang to convey his decree. Wen replied: "With the state’s demise, my duty is to die." When summoned and questioned, "What is your wish?" he answered: "I, Tianxiang, received the Song’s favor as its chancellor. How could I serve two dynasties? I only wish for death." At his execution, he faced it with composure, saying, "My task is complete." His wife, née Ouyang, gathered his remains and clothing. In his belt, she found a eulogy that read:

*Confucius spoke of achieving ren;*
*Mencius spoke of attaining yi.*
*Only when yi is fully realized*
*does ren reach its perfection.*
*What is the purpose of reading the books of sages and worthies?*
*From this moment onward,*
*may I at last be without shame.*

*The History of the Song* concludes with this judgment: Among the loyal and righteous ministers of the fallen Song, after Wen Tianxiang, there were Hunan Pacification Commissioner Li Fei, Chizhou Circuit Judge Zhao Angfa, Yangzhou Commander Jiang Cai, Zhenzhou Prefect Miao Zaicheng, Changzhou Commander Wang Anjie, Hubei Judicial Commissioner Zhang Qiyan, Anji Prefect Zhao Liangchun, Wuwei Prefect Zhao Huai, Huaidong Commander Li Tingzhi, Prefect Zhao Mengliang, Changzhou Prefect Yao Gao, Inspector Zhao Yugao, Xinghua Prefect Chen Zan, Circuit Judge Zhang Yuezhong, Chaozhou Prefect Ma Fa, Jiangdong Commander Xie Fangde, Xinzhou Prefect Tang Zhen, along with Zhang Shijie, Lu Xiufu, and Chen Wenlong—all were the most eminent. Many others besides these also stood firm.

The record states: Yu Zhang once said, "The hearts of the Zhou [Dynasty] and Confucius enable people to understand the Dao." If scholars truly grasp the Dao, then the hearts of the Zhou and Confucius will be profoundly realized within them.

The talents of the Three Dynasties possessed the hearts of the Zhou and Confucius, thus regarding life and death, departure and loyalty as naturally as the shifting of cold and heat, day and night—so that loyalty and righteousness were easily practiced. By the Han and Tang, the study of classics and the veneration of ancient prose had supplanted the hearts of the Zhou and Confucius. Thus, the *Xiaojing* and self-defense were championed by Chao Cuo and Dong Zhongshu, while the ancient prose movement was initiated by Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan. As a result, those who understood the Dao became few, and life and death, departure and loyalty weighed upon them like nine tripods of a thousand jun—so that loyalty and righteousness were difficult to practice.

Now, observing the Song: Wang Anshi further corrupted the Six Classics, and the Way of integrity and shame perished. Thus, when the Northern Song fell, few held fast to their principles. Yet the teachings of Zhou Dunyi, Cheng Yi, Zhang Zai, and Zhu Xi illuminated the Dao, clarifying the principles of learning. When the Southern Song was destroyed, many died for righteousness—a clear and manifest effect.

Therefore, my unwavering resolve and tireless effort are not truly a love of debate, but a necessity. Let the reader consider this carefully.

Zhang Shijie began as a low-ranking officer and, through accumulated merit, rose to become Commander of the Huangzhou and Wuding Armies. At a time of great peril, when summons to defend the throne went unanswered, Shijie alone led his troops to the capital’s defense. All marveled at his resolve. From Defender of Hezhou, he was promoted in mere months to Grand Master for Palace Counsel, assuming command of the imperial armies. As the enemy forces closed in on Lin’an, Shijie urged the relocation of the three palaces to the sea and proposed joining forces with Wen Tianxiang for a final stand. Yet Chen Yizhong, then dispatching envoys to sue for peace, refused his plan.

After the Song surrendered, Shijie, filled with grief and indignation, led his troops from Lin’an to Dinghai. The Yuan envoy, Commander Bian Biao, attempted to persuade him to yield. Shijie severed Biao’s tongue and stoned him to death, swearing to die rather than surrender. He then followed the two princes to Fuzhou. When Emperor Duanzong ascended, Shijie was appointed Vice Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs. Upon Emperor Hua’s enthronement, he was further honored as Junior Preceptor and enfeoffed as Duke of Yue. Deeming Chaozhou unsuitable, he relocated to Yashan in Xinhui.

When Zhang Hongfan attacked Yashan, some advised Shijie: "The Yuan forces have blockaded the harbor with their fleet, leaving us no room to advance or retreat. Why not seize the harbor first? If we prevail, it will be the nation’s fortune; if not, we may still flee westward." Shijie, fearing disunity and certain dissolution if they moved, replied: "For years we have wandered the seas—when will it end? Now we must decide victory or defeat here." He then burned the temporary court and market, lashing together over a thousand large ships to form a floating fortress, resolved to fight to the death.

Hongfan captured Shijie’s nephew Han and sent him as an envoy, offering rank three times to induce surrender. Shijie recounted the deeds of ancient loyal ministers, declaring: "I know surrender would bring wealth and honor, but I will die for my lord—this I will not change." Soon after, a violent typhoon arose, and the sailors sought to turn toward shore. Shijie said: "It is useless."

Bring me a stick of incense.

Looking up to heaven, he cried aloud: "I have done all I could for the House of Zhao. One lord perished, and another was enthroned. Now we perish again—if any survive, perhaps they may yet repel the enemy and restore a Zhao prince to preserve the ancestral sacrifices. But if this is so, is it truly Heaven’s will? If Heaven no longer wishes the Zhao lineage to endure, then let this great wind capsize my ship." The ship capsized, and he drowned.

Lu Xiufu, from the age of three, studied under Master Meng of his village, who alone pointed to him as no ordinary child. In adulthood, he passed the imperial examinations. When Li Tingzhi governed Huainan, he summoned Xiufu to his staff and promoted him to the rank of policy advisor. At the time, border affairs grew dire, and many fled, but Xiufu alone remained. Tingzhi recommended him to the court, and he was appointed Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, later rising to Vice Minister of the Court of the Imperial Clan.

When the Yuan invaded and the two Song princes fled to Wenzhou, Xiufu pursued and joined them. He sent messengers to summon Chen Yizhong, Zhang Shijie, and others, and together they enthroned Emperor Duzong’s son, the Prince of Yi. Yizhong, recognizing Xiufu’s long experience in military affairs, consulted him on every matter before acting. Xiufu devoted himself wholeheartedly to assisting, leaving no detail unaddressed.

As the court wandered in exile, affairs were hastily managed, yet whenever they held court, Xiufu maintained solemn dignity, as if conducting state rituals in a proper hall. Sometimes, while traveling, he would weep uncontrollably, wiping his tears with his court robes until they were soaked, moving all around him to sorrow.

When Emperor Duanzong died, the ministers all wished to scatter. Xiufu said: "The late Emperor’s sole surviving son remains—where shall we abandon him? The ancients revived a dynasty with but a single regiment or a lone fortress. Now we have all the officials and tens of thousands of soldiers. If Heaven has not yet decreed the end of Song, how can we not strive to restore the state?" With the others, he enthroned Emperor Duzong’s younger brother, the Prince of Wei, appointing Xiufu as Left Chancellor to wield authority.

At the time, Shijie stationed his troops at Yashan. Xiufu oversaw military affairs abroad and managed labor and construction at home, with every initiative originating from him. Though buffeted by flight and displacement, he still recited the *Great Learning* daily, never ceasing his exhortations.

When Yashan fell, Xiufu fled to the Prince of Wei’s ship. The royal vessel was large, surrounded by a ring of ships, making escape impossible. Drawing his sword, he drove his wife and children into the sea, then carried the young emperor on his back and leapt into the waves to drown.

**Record:** Observing Shijie’s drowning and Xiufu’s bearing the emperor into the sea, I cannot but sigh in profound sorrow. Alas! The lament of the broken chariot pole—grief for the times—have we truly witnessed such men in our age? At that time, all Shu was lost, Jingxiang had fallen, and the realm offered no refuge. Yet these few steadfast gentlemen, clinging to loyalty and righteousness, persevered to the very end. They met their deaths with uprightness—were they not akin to Qu Yuan and Jia Yi of old?

Chen Wenlong was a descendant of Junqing. Gifted in literature and resolute in integrity, he ranked first in the imperial examinations of Xianchun 5. From Military Commissioner of Zhenjiang, he was appointed Supervising Censor. When Xiangyang was besieged, Jia Sidao feigned a request to lead the army while secretly ensuring his own retention, ultimately losing Xiangyang. Wenlong submitted a memorial in vehement remonstrance.

At the time, Wang Huan and Chen Yizhong could devise no unified strategy, instead squabbling in court over private interests. Wenlong again memorialized: "When the Three Sovereigns harmonized their hearts to align with the Dao, the northern troops seized cities and built forts, while we engaged in empty courtesy and mutual suspicion—like one who, rescuing the drowning and extinguishing fires, observes the decorum of a leisurely stroll. I urge the summoning of the great ministers to unite in governance and cease futile debate." Yet the two remained irreconcilable and departed. By the time they returned in the tenth month, all was already lost.

That winter, he was repeatedly promoted to the position of Participant in Determining Government Affairs. When Prince Yi was established as the Pacification Commissioner of Min and Guang, the surrendered general Wang Shijiang once again led a great army into Guang. Jianning, Quanzhou, and Fuzhou all surrendered. Wang Gangzhong, the prefect of Fuzhou, dispatched an envoy to Gou Xinghua. Wenlong beheaded the envoy and sent a letter of censure to Shijiang and Gangzhong for betraying the state. He then mobilized the local militia to defend themselves, though the city’s troops numbered fewer than a thousand. When the great army came to attack, they sent Wenlong’s in-law to deliver a letter urging surrender. Wenlong burned the letter and executed the messenger, declaring: "You gentlemen merely fear death, yet do you know that even this life cannot escape death?" He then sent his general Lin Hua to scout the borders. Hua immediately defected, guiding the enemy to the city walls. Cao Chengsun, the Vice Prefect, opened the gates to surrender. Wenlong was seized and brought to the enemy camp, where they sought to force his submission. Unyielding, he pointed to his abdomen and said: "All within here is loyalty, righteousness, and learning. How can you compel me?" He was then shackled and sent to Hangzhou. From the moment he left Xinghua, Wenlong refused all food and starved to death upon reaching Hangzhou.

The record states: Both Tianxiang and Wenlong ranked first in the court examinations—could their loyalty and righteousness alone have made them renowned? At that time, those in power cherished the joy of life but lacked the resolve to die. Fortunately, one or two gentlemen devoted their hearts to the state, their literary grace and moral integrity setting an example for the age. In such times, within they harbored the resolve to die, while without, they found no joy in life. This is why they sacrificed themselves to fulfill their humanity without regret.

For some, integrity is innate from youth, while for others, learning matures naturally in adulthood. Thus, one set his heart on ritual and virtue from childhood, and those who failed to do so were no true men. The other scorned those who feared death and clung to life, unaware that life itself cannot escape death. Though their paths were the same, their fates were one.

**On the Righteousness of Ruler and Minister**

From *The Imperial Literary Collection*: The Great Ming’s Proclamation to the Central Plains states: Since ancient times, emperors and kings have ruled all under heaven, with the Central Kingdom governing the inner lands to command the barbarians, and the barbarians dwelling beyond to serve the Central Kingdom. Never has it been heard that barbarians should rule all under heaven. When the Song dynasty’s mandate declined, the Yuan, a northern tribe, usurped the Central Kingdom, causing men of insight and integrity to lament the inversion of cap and shoe. Later, their heirs grew indolent, forsaking the Way of ruler and minister, compounded by the usurpation of power by chief ministers, the vengeance of the Censorate, and the cruelty of local officials. Thus, the people’s hearts turned away, the realm rose in rebellion, and the people of our Central Kingdom perished in such numbers that their brains and entrails covered the earth, while survivors could not protect their own flesh and blood. Though this arose from human affairs, it was truly a time when Heaven loathed their virtue and cast them aside.

I, originally a commoner, was thrust into chaos by the world’s turmoil and raised by the people’s will. Leading my forces across the Yangtze, I established myself in the strategic land of Jianye. Soon, the entire south came under my sway, and the people lived in peace with ample food. Yet, seeing the people of the Central Plains long without a true lord, my heart ached with sorrow. Reverently accepting Heaven’s mandate, I dared not rest at ease. I resolved to dispatch troops northward to expel the barbarian usurpers, rescue the people from suffering, and restore the dignity of Han governance. Fearing the people might not understand and flee in alarm, taking their families northward only to sink deeper into misery, I first issued this proclamation: when my armies arrive, let the people not flee. My commands are strict and inviolable, not a single hair’s harm shall befall them. Those who submit shall dwell forever in peace within the Central Kingdom; those who resist shall be driven beyond the frontier. For the people of our Central Kingdom, Heaven must surely appoint a son of the Central Kingdom to bring them peace—how could barbarians be fit to rule them?

It is recorded: This was how our August Ancestor succeeded Heaven and established the supreme principle—what he embodied in himself, he verified among the people; he examined it against the Three Kings and found no error; he established it upon heaven and earth and found no contradiction; he tested it before ghosts and spirits and found no doubt; and a hundred generations hence, even sages shall not question it. Some may compare this to the Han founder’s rise. The Qin was indeed tyrannical, yet its system of enfeoffment endured for over a thousand years after the Three Dynasties—still part of our Central Kingdom. The lands of Qi and Feng, where King Wen used them to spread the transforming influence of the *Er Nan*, were still our people. How could they be likened to the Yuan, with their foul stench, filth, and alien customs of left-buttoned robes? Even if one speaks of the Qin’s might in destroying the Six States and its legal system, or the common people’s perspective, or its corruption of ritual and propriety and disruption of human relations, there is still no comparison. Since our Master Confucius distinguished the civilized within from the barbarian without and restored order after chaos, over two thousand years have passed before this great righteousness was once more upheld. Rare indeed is the reader of these words who does not bow in reverence and sigh in awe.

From *Records of Illustrious Ministers*: When the Ming Ancestor first rose in Huaiyou, he invoked the punitive expeditions of Tang and Wu, and men of discernment flocked to his banner. At that time, his ministers—pillars and vital limbs of the state—were all heroes of surpassing talent and virtue, such as those of single-minded sincerity and deep virtue, whose hearts were set on honoring their lord and sheltering the people. Foremost among them was Xu Da, the Prince of Zhongshan and Martial Pacifier; next, Chang Yuchun, the Prince of Kaiping and Loyal and Martial; then Li Wen Zhong, the Prince of Qiyang and Martial and Tranquil; followed by Deng Yu, the Prince of Ninghe and Martial and Compliant; then Tang He, the Prince of Shou’ou and Magnanimous and Martial; and Mu Ying, the Prince of Qianning and Illustrious and Tranquil. Minister Peng Shao eulogized: "Heaven favored the sagely and enlightened, bestowing worthy aides. They swept away the rebellious lords and upheld our Hongwu Emperor."

Against the northern tribes at Yin Mountain, avenging a thousand years of shame. Storming cities yet sparing their people, his hands preserved the treasuries intact. Enfeoffed with titles and lands, he held sway over the Wei territories. He stabilized the northern wilds—none dared insult him. His qi shaped mountains and rivers, leaving no thing to rot.

Chang Yuchun’s eulogy:
A man of towering stature and mighty bearing, fierce as a tiger or leopard. Wielding hammer and spade, he early pledged to the true lord. The false Han and pretender Wu were swept away in a single stroke. He charged into Yan, restoring the Central Plains. Granted lands and titles, he opened the lands of Ezhu. Truly a marshal of renown, his might resplendent. Enshrined in the ancestral temple at Tong, his sacrifices endure for a thousand ages.

Li Wen Zhong’s eulogy:
Among the meritorious and imperial kin, a hero of his generation. Well-versed in military classics, master of the Six Strategies. Crimson his armor, crimson his robes—his household held only battle garb. The former capitals of Song and Yuan were both seized and encompassed. His might proclaimed across ten thousand li, his toil undeniable. Rewarded with the highest rank, his state established in Cao. Posthumously enfeoffed as a prince, his temple offerings honored with imperial favor.

Deng Yu’s eulogy:
Our Compliant King, a stalwart and imposing man. His merit matched the founding ministers, from the first raising of the righteous banner. His qi towered over the six armies, regarding foes as nothing. What fortress did he not breach? What strength did he not uproot? He comforted the people and honored the learned, bringing relief to those revived. Governing eight provinces as military commissioner, he spread benevolence and trust. Following ancient rites, he was ennobled at Ezhu.

Tang He’s eulogy:
Magnanimous and Martial, a man of Feng and Pei, a pillar and vital limb. Aiding the throne as heart and backbone, he followed the campaign from the lower Yangtze, swiftly conquering Ou and Min. Crushing the stubborn and soothing the compliant, he executed punitive expeditions with justice. The Six Directions unified, his merit foundational. Laying down his arms to retire, his bond with the throne grew ever closer. His achievement ranked with Wu and Deng, his peers.

Mu Ying’s eulogy:
Ah, Illustrious and Tranquil! Early nurtured in the palace’s inner chambers. Wisdom and courage flourished in him, and he emulated the martial feats of the ancients. Entrusted with defense and governance of the frontiers, his charge was weighty. The southwest was pacified. The remnant clans of the Yuan, entrenched for years, defied orders and refused communication. With a single strike he subdued them—none failed to submit. There he established his headquarters, enfeoffed with hereditary titles.

The Record states:

The first to issue proclamations throughout the Central Plains marked the great divide between Hua and Yi, the natural order of Heaven and humanity—what is called "a majestic battle array, a righteous banner." The subsequent praises of the Six Kings were like the roar of a tiger stirring the wind, the rise of a dragon summoning clouds—what is meant by "like sounds resonating, like qi seeking its kind."

Mencius said: "Every five hundred years, a true king must arise." Within this span, there must also be those of illustrious renown. This is when Heaven and Earth close and reopen, the sun and moon darken and brighten again, the Central Realm endures hardship and returns to peace, and humankind, once intermixed, is once more distinguished.

Since the eras of Tang, Yu, and the Three Dynasties, there has never been such great chaos, nor such great order. Thus, the bond between ruler and minister is brought to its conclusion. As for those whose fine words and virtuous deeds may serve as models for the age, they are listed beside them.

Minister Wang Wendu was stern and solemn by nature, sparing of speech and laughter. At home, he carried himself with gravity; yet when receiving others, his amiability was palpable. Learned and quick-witted, he repeatedly oversaw the spring examinations and the palace tests, selecting talent most abundantly. He served in the Hanlin Academy for thirty years, diligent and untiring. When he later assumed the post of Minister of Personnel, he grew even more modest and cautious. At the time, the dismissal of court officials and the recommendation of worthy candidates were entrusted solely to the Ministry of Personnel. Minister Wang took care to promote and delegate authority to his subordinates. When censors were dispatched on inspection tours, he ensured their careful selection. From then on, discipline was rigorously upheld, and the scramble for favor abruptly ceased.

Minister Liu Wen’an once remarked: "Minister Wang first held positions in literary office, rising to Academician; then bore the responsibility of governance, ascending to Minister of Personnel; and finally, walked the path of moral cultivation, attaining the rank of Grand Preceptor. In these three stations, public opinion unanimously affirmed his fitness without dissent."

Moreover, in his time, grand proclamations and great manifestos stirred the ears of the realm; the discernment of worthies and the elevation of the exceptional each bore their fruits. With dignified bearing and courtly demeanor, his conduct set a standard that evoked the ancients. Even today, one may still look back with admiration and longing—such a legacy cannot be erased.

Minister Wang Zhongsou Ao was upright, resolute, and steadfast—pure, frugal, and disciplined. He adhered to principle and upheld the law, not yielding even a hair’s breadth. No matter how great or small the affair, once he had experienced it, he never forgot. When a matter required action, he was restless in sleep and food, sitting up to await dawn. His residence remained unchanged from its original state. After court duties, he retired to the chamber for officials, returning home only on the first and fifteenth days of the month to pay respects at his ancestral shrine. No private petitions crossed his threshold; bribes dared not approach. When powerful figures sought favors, he gently but firmly refused. Thus, people feared him yet bore no grudge. Though he endured many upheavals, he remained untroubled, harboring no resentment or partiality toward friend or foe. He once declared: "Is the Ministry of Personnel a place for settling scores?"

Minister Li Wenda said: "Gaoyao spoke of the Nine Virtues—Minister Wang embodied five: in chaos, he was reverent; in turmoil, resolute; in simplicity, incorruptible; in strength, steadfast; and in vigor, righteous."

Minister Liu Wen’an further remarked: "When Minister Wang was dispatched to govern renowned provinces and distant frontiers—whether in the south along the Jiang and Guang, where he subdued powerful outlaws and pacified the Man and Liao tribes; in the west across Guan and Shaan, where the Qiang and Rong peoples obeyed his commands; or in the east near Liao and Jie, where barbarian chieftains were awed by his integrity—wherever treacherous rebels rose like floodwaters, his presence stood firm as a great bulwark. In overseeing the selection of officials, through the reigns of Jingtai, Tianshun, and Chenghua, though the years changed, his appointment and favor remained unwavering. This was not only due to the grandeur of his strategies but also because his handling of affairs was without flaw."

Minister Wang Duanyi Ru served five reigns with unyielding integrity and forthright speech, discerning right from wrong. Once, as magistrate of Yangzhou, the people erected a stele to praise his virtue. When he governed Dengyang, bandits arose in Xiangyang, and the court summoned him to suppress them.

The Grand Masters Liu Qianjin and others wished to unleash troops to scour the mountains, but Minister Wang refused. Instead, he posted proclamations urging displaced people to return to their livelihoods, and for this, they built him a shrine and painted his portrait in reverence. When he served as provincial inspector of Yunnan, the eunuch overseer secretly traded with foreign tribes, extorting without end, and none dared to intervene. Minister Wang declared: "In the past, the eunuch overseer of Jiaozhi was unfit for his post, leading to the loss of an entire region and the rebellion of Tengchong and Luchuan. What is happening now is even more dire." Over nine months, he submitted twenty memorials, his forthright voice resounding throughout the realm.

Later, as inspector of the Southern Metropolitan Region, the eunuch Wang Jing traveled through the southeast by imperial post, seizing rare treasures, causing terror wherever he went. Minister Wang submitted a memorial detailing how such actions lost the people’s hearts, damaged the dignity of the state, harmed harmonious qi, and invited disaster. The emperor ordered his arrest and imprisonment, but both court and commoners rejoiced, declaring that he possessed the power to turn the tide of heaven. He was then transferred to the Ministry of War in Nanjing as minister. When the vice director Lin Jun was imprisoned for remonstrating against the construction of Yongchang Temple, Minister Wang spoke in his defense, and the emperor ordered him to retire.

When Emperor Xiaozong ascended the throne, he recalled Minister Wang as minister of the Ministry of Personnel. He curbed the influence of opportunists, commended those of noble character, and promoted long-neglected talents, allowing no favoritism. Men such as Geng of Julu, Zhang of Huating, Li of Xiangcheng, Peng of Putian, He of Xujiang, Zhou of Taiyuan, and Ni of Qiantang—all paragons of the realm—were elevated to key positions to assist in realizing the transformative governance of the Hongzhi era. To this day, the people of the realm still praise the name of San Yuan without cease.

Minister Ma Duansu Wensheng stood in court for over fifty years, dedicating himself to the state without shirking hardship or peril. His nature was upright and unyielding, sparing in speech and laughter, and he disdained extravagance. Initially, as an inspector in Shanxi and Huguang, he earned a reputation wherever he went. Promoted to surveillance commissioner of Fujian, he meted out the law to eunuch overseers who oppressed the people, and the people revered his virtue, singing his praises along the roads. When the native chieftain Man Si of Guyuan incited rebellion, Minister Ma, then serving as chief censor, captured him alive.

At the time, bandit uprisings surged like swarms of bees: Li Huzi in Hanzhong, Huojier in Tong Pass, and Wang Biao of Mancheng each amassed followers to plunder and kill, their forces sharp and fierce. Minister Ma eliminated them all through strategy. Later, as commander of the Three Frontiers, he lured the northern barbarians deep into the mountains, where he had troops lie in ambush at Tangyang Ridge. When the barbarians arrived, they were ambushed and suffered heavy casualties, prompting the renaming of the ridge to Deshengpo ("Victory Slope").

Promoted to vice minister of war, he was dispatched to the northeastern frontier when an alert was raised. Drawing on his expertise in military affairs, he organized the Five-Flower Camp and the Eight-Formation Diagram to train the troops. He also submitted fifteen memorials on border defense, all timely and practical, and the barbarian threat subsided. When the Jianzhou Jurchens rebelled, he was sent again. The chief censor Chen Tie sought to lure and kill tribute-bearing foreigners to cover his own mistakes, while the eunuch Wang Zhi, relying on imperial favor and past achievements, covertly supported Chen’s scheme. Because Minister Ma treated Wang with defiance and disdained his attendants, Chen bribed others to slander him. Wang Zhi returned to the capital and falsely accused Minister Ma of recklessly provoking border conflicts, leading to his demotion and exile. After Wang Zhi’s downfall, the emperor recalled Minister Ma to pacify the northeast. By this time, he had been sent there three times, each time achieving extraordinary feats, and the people of the northeast still remember him fondly.

Promoted to minister of war, he addressed the repeated rebellions of Hami, stating: "If we show only kindness without demonstrating might, they will never learn to fear." He urged Peng Qing, the vice commander of Suzhou, to lead a mixed force of Han and tribal soldiers in a surprise attack, greatly enhancing his prestige. Aheima, cowed by this display of power, repented and sent envoys to offer tribute, returning the golden seal of Shanba. Thus, the Western Regions were pacified.

When the barbarian chieftain Huosai led his forces to raid Datong in a fierce onslaught, the capital was placed on high alert. The emperor summoned Minister Ma to the inner palace to consult on strategies for defense and warfare. He recommended the Duke of Baoguo, Zhu Hui, and others to reinforce the defenses and ordered all border regions to strengthen their watchtowers and prepare their weapons. With officials dismissed and defenses in place, the enemy soon fled far away. He was later transferred to minister of personnel.

During the Hongzhi era, the Filial Emperor summoned him to the Warm Pavilion for a private audience, entrusting him with the scrutiny of all state affairs, and even commanded eunuch attendants to support him as he descended the steps.

That year, in the grand evaluation of officials, over a thousand incompetent or negligent officers from various provinces were dismissed without dispute.

At the dawn of the Zhengde era, he earnestly petitioned to retire from office. Yet from the moment he departed, the conduct of governance underwent a marked shift—the very mechanism of promotion and demotion had lost its guiding principle.

Minister Han, posthumously honored as Loyal and Steadfast, possessed a bearing as towering and unyielding as a mountain, his demeanor grave and composed, his refinement as if naturally endowed. Through diligent self-cultivation and frugal living, he served in the provincial and central administrations for over forty years, faithfully attending to three successive reigns. Favored by the sagely emperors, he toiled day and night in repayment of their trust, ever striving to deepen his loyalty and enhance his service.

As Minister of Revenue, he memorialized seven abuses requiring reform: first, the corruption in the *kaizhong* salt permit system; second, the illicit trafficking of private salt; third, the undervaluing of official salt sales; fourth, the fraudulent compensation for salt deficits; fifth, the smuggling of inferior salt in official shipments; sixth, the cross-border sale of salt; and seventh, the neglect and laxity of the salt transport authorities. His indictments were incisive and precise, exposing decades of accumulated malpractice without omission, thereby bringing relief to both the public and private sectors.

At the time, the situation in Xuanfu and Datong grew dire, with incessant demands for supplies. This coincided with successive imperial funerals and weddings, along with unceasing expenditures for the court, the imperial family, the various princely households, and the border defenses. He managed these affairs with meticulous care, ensuring that urgent needs were met as they arose.

Later, the treacherous eunuchs Liu Jin and his ilk, relying on imperial favor and long-standing influence, obscured the sovereign’s judgment with their bewitching schemes. They turned night into day, indulging in dissipation without restraint, and in their wake, usurped power to wield tyranny, their malevolence casting a shadow over the realm. The scholar-officials trembled in fear, each seeking only to protect themselves and avoid calamity.

Yet he, grieving for the late Filial Emperor and deeply concerned for the fate of the imperial house, took the lead among the officials of the ministries, the Censorate, and the Six Offices of Scrutiny. They prostrated themselves before the palace gates, submitting memorials to expose the villains’ crimes, their pleas accompanied by tears, beseeching that the law be upheld and righteousness preserved. Though he suffered persecution for his stance, his unwavering integrity and resolute virtue inspired awe throughout the court and the realm.

Grand Secretary Liu Jian once remarked: “The state has nurtured its scholars for a hundred and fifty years, yet in this generation, it has produced only one Han Guandao.”

Minister Liu, posthumously honored as Loyal and Illustrious, enjoyed even greater imperial favor. During the Hongzhi era, when he served as Minister of War and Dai Shan as Left Censor-in-Chief, the Filial Emperor, whenever faced with major state affairs, would summon the two for private counsel, saying: “If there is any matter of concern, I wish to consult with you both.” Yet if the matter did not pertain to their respective offices, he would refrain from troubling them further.

Hereafter, when there are matters that ought to be enacted or abolished, you may write a sealed memorial and submit it privately." The minister replied, "I dare not." The emperor asked, "Why not?" Grand Secretary Dai Shan answered, "The precedent of Li Zixing from the previous reign serves as a warning." The emperor said, "I discuss state affairs with you—how could this be compared to Zixing, who schemed for private gain and harmed the common good?" Dai Shan replied, "If ministers submit sealed memorials and the court acts upon them, it differs little from the underhanded decrees of former dynasties. Today, we should model ourselves on the distant examples of ancient sage-kings and the recent precedents of our imperial ancestors: major matters should be entrusted externally to the Six Ministries and internally consulted with the Grand Secretariat. If sealed memorials become the norm, over time both ruler and ministers will fall into corruption, and it will set no proper example for later generations. I dare not comply." The emperor praised his response.

On another occasion, he wrote to Wu Tingju, saying: "The Way of holding office begins with rectifying oneself. By 'rectifying oneself,' I mean not only guarding against profit but also distancing oneself from fame. If one harbors even the slightest intent to seek renown, then every action becomes self-serving—what Master Cheng called 'today’s officials serving themselves.' Proceeding thus, how can one hope for good governance, a contented populace, and the achievement of meritorious service? Reflect deeply and examine yourself. In serving superiors and governing subordinates, one must act with sincerity and forbearance. Sincerity naturally moves others, while forbearance allows one to empathize with the feelings of all. By empathizing and moving them, there is no person one cannot guide and no matter one cannot resolve."

Minister Dai Shan, posthumously honored as Respectful and Upright, was mild in temperament yet inwardly steadfast, never compromising his principles. Transparent and without guile, he served as Left Censor-in-Chief, where he redoubled his self-discipline, rigorously upholding the moral standards of the court. Even in minor administrative details, he pursued precision. He participated once in the evaluation of metropolitan officials and twice in the assessment of provincial officials.

In the year *yichou* of the Hongzhi era, after discussing state affairs with Grand Secretary Liu Daxia, the emperor ordered an eunuch to present them each with two ingots of silver, saying: "I have heard that during the court assemblies, some civil officials avoid suspicion by shutting their doors and refusing visitors. But even if you, like others, keep your doors open to guests, who would dare approach you with bribes? I know your integrity personally, hence this reward." He further instructed them not to attend court to express gratitude, fearing that other ministers might feel ashamed or apprehensive upon learning of it.

When the emperor personally presided over a major judicial inquiry, all officials trembled in awe, yet Minister Dai remained composed in his responses. At times, his reasoned arguments would dispel the emperor’s anger, and imperial wrath would suddenly clear. The emperor, recognizing his integrity and prudence, would often summon him for private audiences, engaging in discussions that lasted for hours. Such was the esteem in which he was held.

Minister Zhang Fuhua, posthumously honored as Solemn and Resolute, carried himself with dignified composure, never speaking or laughing frivolously. Upholding the law with unwavering dedication, he commanded great respect in his time. He distinguished right from wrong as clearly as black from white, and though he might occasionally yield on minor matters, his resolve in matters of principle never wavered. Early in his career as a Hanlin bachelor, when Li Wenda and Peng Wenxian sought to retain him in the Hanlin Academy, he and Liu Shushan firmly declined, later earning renown as statesmen for their governance. Thus, those of pure reputation often disdained financial administration. Yet when Minister Zhang oversaw fiscal affairs in two provinces, he managed them with such competence that resources were abundant, while his integrity was so unassailable that it seemed divinely attested. Gentle yet unyielding, principled yet not harsh, he remained unmoved by personal likes or dislikes. His thoughts were upright, his considerations meticulous, and his demeanor serene and composed—so much so that the corrupt and deceitful reformed of their own accord. His incorruptibility, impartiality, and sound judgment were rooted in his nature and sprang from his heart, further refined by his literary and scholarly pursuits. Thus, his aspirations and policies were flawless, boundless in their purity, enduring and unchanging. Truly, he was a vessel of great capacity.

As Left Censor-in-Chief, he petitioned for stricter prohibitions against the greed, cruelty, and unscrupulous ambition of local officials. When reviewing a complex case involving a favored courtier convicted of a crime, some doubted whether the punishment was excessive. Minister Zhang remained steadfast in his judgment, and even when the emperor reconsidered and issued a revised decree, he insisted that the man’s descendants should not be burdened by his ill-gotten gains—remaining uncompromising until his death.

In summation: Observing the conduct of Minister Wen Duan and those who followed, their moral examples and demeanor were often alike, as were their ranks, reputations, and longevity. Yet upon closer examination, distinctions emerge. Li Xiangi once remarked: "The institutional apex of civil governance lies in the Six Ministries, where the ministers are as revered as the Northern Dipper. Whether in the height of summer or the depths of winter, their governance spans the realm. When the Taizong Emperor campaigned in the north, the entire nation was entrusted to them. The Three Yangs—bright, harmonious, and diligent—presided over the court, ushering in an era of peace. The ruler enjoyed ease while his ministers labored—such were the ministers who served as heaven’s stewards."

The Yingzong Emperor’s treatment of Minister Wen Da was comparable to Taizong’s regard for Ma Zhou, where a single virtuous official received profound trust. Through discreet planning and decisive action, the myriad affairs of state were managed with precision, marking a transformation in governance. During the Chenghua era, Ministers Wang Shu of Sanyuan, Wang Tai of Hezhou, Qin Xian of Shan County, Huang Fu of Fengqiu, and others stood forth like towering peaks—still as mountains when at rest, striking like thunder when in motion. In major matters, they wielded authority like an axe; in minor details, they were as meticulous as the tides. They guarded against flatterers and favored officials, wielding the sword of justice to rescue the realm. Their presence inspired awe, and those who crossed them trembled. Could such men be swayed by considerations of life or death, wealth or honor? Yet compared to the era before the Great Pacification, they were markedly different. Was this due to the times, the differences in rank, or the extent of their entrusted authority?

During the Hongzhi era, ministers such as Liu Daxia of Huating, Han Wen of Hongdong, Ma Wenzhou of Junyang, Xu Jin of Lingbao, Zhou Jing of Yangqu, Geng Yu of Lushi, Ni Yue of Jinling, and Zhang Fuhua of Anfu all earned renown as eminent statesmen. Yet their aspirations lay in restraint and frugality, their conduct in precision and discretion. If a minor compromise could achieve a greater good, they would not hesitate. Thus, the style of governance shifted once more. Though their actions left little visible trace, their adherence to principle was resolute—perhaps this too was a matter of destiny.

When the voices of remonstrance grew bold, criticism and praise determined promotions and demotions, and the air was thick with contention, even high ministers deferred in humility. Since the Zhengde era, such uprightness has become rare. Yet when these men enjoyed imperial favor and received praise, they would promptly erect shrines and erect steles, commissioning odes and inscriptions, carving their names into wood and stone, lest their legacy fail to endure for posterity.

With this mindset prevailing, cunning and artifice arose of themselves—those skilled in rhetoric now labored to gloss over faults, marking yet another shift.

So the chronicles record.

The Censor-in-Chief, Lord Gu Zuo, was stern by nature and steadfast in upholding the law, his unyielding integrity unbowed. He championed rectitude and detested wickedness, so that both officials and commoners stood in awe. As Intendant of the Capital Prefecture, even meritorious nobles and imperial kinsmen dared not overstep, and his administrative renown blazed forth, drawing comparison to Bao Xiaosu. Emperor Xuanzong once asked, “Among the court ministers, who might be fit to oversee the Censorate?” Yang Shiqu replied, “The Minister of Communications, Gu Zuo, is incorruptible and commands authority. His tenure as Surveillance Commissioner and in the provincial judicial offices was distinguished by his striking presence.” Yang Rong added, “When he served as Intendant of the Capital, his governance was pure and abuses were eradicated.” Pleased, the emperor promoted him to Right Censor-in-Chief. His enforcement of discipline was rigorous and impartial; he impeached over twenty unworthy officials, and even petty clerks and runners trembled in fear. Never did he speak ill or well of others. From dawn to dusk, he rested briefly in the waiting chamber, then retired alone to a small side room, never idling with other officials unless on public business. Though he enjoyed the full favor of the sovereign and the height of influence, he also possessed the substantive power to curb and suppress.

Lord Qin Xianyi was resolute, upright, and incorruptible, his prestige long established. As a censor, he performed his duties with forthright diligence, exuding an air of authority. When he served as Grand Coordinator of Shaanxi, the guards of the Qin princely establishment ran amok, oppressing the people. He arrested them all and showed no leniency. The prince could not endure it and memorialized that Lord Qin had acted with overbearing arrogance. The Martial Emperor flew into a rage and had him imprisoned in the Embroidered-Uniform Guard’s jail. The eunuch Shang Hong was ordered to confiscate his property, but found only a bolt of yellow silk and a few old garments. When Hong reported this, the emperor sighed in admiration for a long while, then issued an edict releasing him and even bestowed ten thousand strings of cash to commend his integrity. He was reassigned as Grand Coordinator of Henan, where the formidable Wang Zhi arrived on an inspection tour. At the time, Wang was arrogating power and authority, his influence towering. Other grand coordinators all bowed in deference, but Lord Qin alone met him as an equal, refusing to yield in the slightest. Wang, recognizing his weight, did not press the matter. Later, when Wang returned to the capital and the emperor inquired about the worthiness of the provincial governors, Wang singled out Lord Qin for praise. Upon his promotion to Left Censor-in-Chief, his presence grew even more imposing, and people said he had the bearing of Gu Zuo.

Minister Wang Tai was by nature upright and unyielding, incapable of the slightest pretense to please others. As a Supervising Secretary during the crisis of *jisi* in the Zhengtong era, Wang Zhen’s monopolization of power had led the state astray, resulting in the emperor’s captivity. When the Prince of Cheng assumed the regency and held court at the Meridian Gate, the assembled officials impeached the treacherous ministers. The Embroidered-Uniform Guard commander Ma Shun shouted from the side, “All officials, disperse!” Minister Wang strode forward and seized Ma Shun by the head, declaring, “This is the very traitor—he must be removed!” The regent withdrew, and the officials beat Ma Shun to death. Later, when the barbarians invaded and advanced on the capital, Minister Wang was ordered to command the defense. He donned his armor, mounted his horse, and rode to the army, where his commands and dispositions were all apt and timely. He died in office as Minister of War.

Minister Huang Ju was incorruptible, severe, and forthright, confronting matters with swift resolve and an unshakable demeanor. He cared nothing for the powerful. Where others shunned guile and cunning, he shouldered the burden without hesitation. As a Section Chief, he was known in the bureaucracy as “unyielding Huang.”

When he served as Provincial Administration Commissioner of Hubei, the monk Jixiao, who had gained favor through sorcery and flattery, indulged in debauchery and gluttony. Returning home to sweep his ancestors’ graves was merely a pretext for advancing his own interests, so Huang ordered the Wuchang Prefecture to calculate and detain him. Before long, Jixiao’s crimes were exposed, and he was sent to the capital in a caged cart to be executed.

Later, as Chief Supervising Censor of the Left, Huang assessed officials’ abilities and entrusted them accordingly. He burned the roster of assignments before the court, declaring, “What matters in governance is securing the right people. How can seniority and length of service be the sole basis for office?” He discarded all his memorials, administrative records, and literary works, leaving none behind. When Jiangnan’s tax payments were remitted in damaged banknotes, the people suffered from brokers’ extortion and coercion, groaning under the burden. As Minister of Revenue, Huang forcefully memorialized the throne to convert these payments to silver, a measure that has benefited the region to this day. No mere words can compare—his integrity was as clear as Zhang Jia’s.

Those who strive to leave a legacy for posterity do not weigh gain and loss; their deeds stand plain and bright. When Duke Xuan of the Du clan was appointed Supervising Censor, he alone upheld a reputation as pure as ice and bitter as the lotus root. As Provincial Surveillance Commissioner, he wore plain cloth robes and ate simple vegetarian meals, which many of his colleagues found unbearable. Upon his promotion to Chief Supervising Censor, his integrity grew even more resolute. During the annual New Year’s ceremony in Nanjing, when officials gathered at the Ministry of Rites to offer congratulations, he would withdraw to a solitary chamber, dismiss the attendants bearing candles, don his court robes, and sit in silence. Only when the drums signaled the start of the ceremony would he emerge to complete the rites. Without informing his colleagues, he would then depart in his sedan chair. Throughout his life, his noble character relied solely on official documents for remembrance. He ordered clerks to transcribe them into dozens of large volumes, intending them to serve as records for future generations.

Duke Yang of the Du clan, Jizong, was by nature upright and forthright, his words and deeds extraordinary. Initially serving as a Department Director in the Ministry of Justice, he found that prisoners in heavy shackles often perished from filth and decay. Whenever he oversaw the prison, he ensured they were given food and drink and allowed to bathe every three days, reviving countless lives. Duke Wang the Loyal recommended him to govern Jiaxing Prefecture, where he arrived with only a single attendant, as if on a brief sojourn. After nine years, he was promoted to Provincial Surveillance Commissioner of Zhejiang, where his strict enforcement of judicial discipline invigorated the entire administration. Previously, local officials had relied on subordinates to procure supplies, and the demands of the eunuch overseers were exorbitant—he abolished all such practices. The people loved him as a parent, and officials revered him as a divine presence. Soon promoted to Chief Supervising Censor and Grand Coordinator of Shuntian, he reclaimed lands seized by imperial relatives and eunuchs, forcing the powerful to retreat. He was naturally inclined to goodness and despised evil, his integrity rooted in his very nature. He never compromised with others, and people stood in awe of his stern rectitude. Even the common folk and children knew his name for his loyalty, filial piety, moral courage, and dignified bearing.

The Record states: Confucius said, “I have never seen a truly resolute man.” And again, “Shen, how could you be resolute?” The commentators explain: “A man with desires cannot be resolute; resoluteness means not yielding to desire.” Were not these men the very embodiment of such resolve? In the radiant splendor of the Great Ming, where crookedness was banished and obstruction cleared, the vast and luminous qi filled the cosmos. How could there fail to emerge men of supreme greatness and resoluteness, nurtured without harm? This is why they so decisively aligned themselves with righteousness and the Dao, free from the slightest trace of weakness or self-interest. How magnificent!

Minister Li the Cultivated, Shimian, harbored great ambitions from youth and was diligent in his studies, plumbing the depths of nature, destiny, morality, and the Dao. Initially appointed as a Department Director in the Ministry of Justice, he was later transferred to the Hanlin Academy as a Reader-in-Waiting. In the nineteenth year of the Yongle reign, when the Three Palaces were struck by fire, an edict sought forthright counsel. Li submitted fifteen proposals, all addressing the ills of the time. The emperor approved fourteen and ordered their implementation. At the start of the Hongxi reign, he again submitted two memorials on current policies, presenting them in person. The emperor, enraged, ordered guards to strike him with sixteen or seventeen metal claws, breaking three of his ribs. Dragged out, he could no longer speak. Soon after, he was reassigned as a censor, with orders to review a batch of prisoners and submit a memorial on current affairs. After three submissions, he was imprisoned in the Embroidered Uniform Guard’s dungeon. His ribs, initially misaligned, were set with splints, and the broken bones suddenly realigned—a miracle attributed to his loyalty. His external injuries healed within a month.

In the first year of the Xuande reign, the emperor visited Wansui Mountain and summoned Li to inquire about the reasons for his earlier offense against the late emperor. The questioning was repeated several times before Li recited his memorial, stopping after the sixth item. The emperor asked, “There were more—why did you not speak further?” Li replied, “Your Majesty’s awe-inspiring presence made it difficult for me to recall the details.” The emperor smiled and said, “These were simply the hardest to voice. Do you still have the draft?” Li answered, “I burned it.” Thus, he was pardoned.

Minister Liu the Loyal and Earnest, Qiu, served as a Hanlin Academician and Lecturer during the Zhengtong reign. He was earnest in his guidance and instruction, his discussions impassioned and unyielding to the powerful. In private, his concern for the times was ever-present. When the northern barbarians repeatedly offered tribute, he grew deeply apprehensive. Later, when unrest erupted in Luchuan and Wang Zhen, newly empowered, indulged his private grudges by launching a massive military campaign, Liu submitted a memorial urging the abandonment of the campaign, the establishment of military colonies, and the use of appeasement to pacify the region, while focusing on defending the northwestern frontier against the barbarian threat. When Luchuan rebelled a second time and troops were again dispatched to suppress it, Liu submitted ten proposals. The first stated: “Your Majesty should personally attend to governance; authority must not be delegated.” Wang Zhen, enraged upon reading it, sought to shift blame but found no pretext. Coincidentally, the compiler Dong Lin, who had offended Wang Zhen by requesting appointment as Minister of Rites, was imprisoned by the Embroidered Uniform Guard. The guard commander Ma Shun was instructed to delve deeply into the case, framing Liu as the mastermind behind Dong’s scheme and falsely accusing them of forming a clique. Liu was dragged before the throne and ultimately died in the Embroidered Uniform Guard’s prison.

Minister Zhong the Reverent and Earnest, Tong, was appointed Supervising Censor during the Jingtai reign. Earlier, in the Zhengtong reign, the heir apparent had already been established, but some now proposed replacing him. Zhong, outraged by the suggestion, was willing to emulate the loyalty of Di Liang and endure the fate of Bi Gan, with no regrets. His words were stern and resolute, and he wept as he spoke. In essence, he argued that the foundation of the state lay in the heir apparent, whose restoration should not be delayed. He also addressed various abuses in governance, ultimately sacrificing himself for the cause.

The imperial decree sent him to the Embroidered Uniform Guard’s prison, where he died.

**Record states:** The three ministers were of one heart and one virtue—some died, some did not. Those who died preserved their integrity in their time, their spirits roaming the eight wilds, rivaling the sun and moon in brilliance, lending color to the cosmos. Those who lived were shielded by divine protection, their flaws concealed like a blemish on a jade disc, their stains cleansed like a flaw in white jade. Before their jade was polished, they were already exalted and celebrated—far beyond those obscure and hidden spirits who become malevolent wraiths or demonic chiefs. Both paths bring honor for ten thousand generations.

**Of Minister Yu the Solemn and Earnest, Qian:** From youth, he harbored great ambition. At twenty, he passed the imperial examination and was appointed censor. Upright and fearless in speech, he was swiftly promoted to Vice Minister of War at just thirty. For eighteen years, he served as inspector-general of Henan and Shanxi before returning to oversee the ministry’s affairs.

In the *jisi* year of Zhengtong (1449), the northern chieftain Esen invaded. At the time, the eunuch Wang Zhen wielded power and urged the emperor to lead the campaign personally. Minister Yu and Minister of War Yong petitioned to dissuade him, but their pleas were ignored. The imperial procession reached Wolf Mountain, where, unprepared and caught off guard, the court faced the sudden arrival of the barbarian cavalry. The imperial army was routed, the emperor’s carriage seized, and the capital plunged into panic. Minister Yu, then in the capital, received the news and wept bitterly. The Empress Dowager, the Sacred and Illustrious, knew of his reputation and promoted him to Minister of War.

At the time, the elite troops of the Three Camps had all been selected for the campaign, leaving only the old, weak, and feeble behind. The city was in turmoil, with a thousand crises unfolding. Minister Yu, with singular focus, managed the lives of millions, and the ancestral temples and altars of the state depended on him for survival. He supported the enthronement of Emperor Jing and honored Emperor Ying as the Supreme Emperor from afar. Only then did the realm recognize its sovereign, the north and south reconnected, tribute flowed in, and within a month, the tools of war and defense were fully prepared. The soldiers’ morale revived, and the people’s hearts steadied.

When the eunuch Xi Ning defected, he first served the enemy, revealing every detail, great and small. He then guided the barbarians, urging them toward Zijing Pass. The capital was placed under martial law, and many fled south with their families. The academician Xu Li recklessly interpreted omens and advocated relocating the capital south. Minister Yu wept in court, declaring with resolve: *"The capital is the root of the realm. The ancestral temples and imperial tombs are here, along with the officials, the people, the treasuries, and the granaries—all fully prepared. If we move, all will be lost. We must learn from the Southern Song’s mistake."* He then firmly upheld the policy of defense.

He selected trusted officials and relatives of the imperial consort to guard the palace, while the resolute and principled censor Wang Tai and others were tasked with securing the nine gates. All those outside the city were ordered to enter, and along the barbarians’ route, a scorched-earth policy was enforced—fortifying defenses and refusing battle. Minister Yu vowed to lead by example, donning armor and helmet himself. He stationed troops outside Desheng Gate and sealed the city gates. With tears, he exhorted the army, reminding them of the nation’s grace, the rarity of loyalty, and the dire consequences of failure. *"To live now is worse than death,"* he declared. The soldiers were moved, their courage redoubled.

On the first day of the tenth month, a scout re-entered the pass, claiming the emperor’s return was imminent. The barbarians charged forward, but the army held firm. Realizing the capital was prepared, they began to retreat. Xi Ning then incited them to demand high-ranking officials for peace talks, along with gold and silk worth millions, seeking to sow discord. The court was at a loss. Minister Yu declared: *"Our only concern now is military affairs. We dare not hear of anything else."*

After seven days, the strategy was refined. The emperor was moved to a secure location, separated from the barbarian camp, and cannons bombarded their position. Countless barbarians perished beneath the artillery, and their morale shattered. They fled under cover of night.

**Record states:** Our Emperor Jing of the Ming surpassed the Song’s Gaozong by far. Observing his actions and demeanor, though his victories were won through momentary strategies, his unwavering resolve and unshakable will were the true foundation. He heeded Wang Zhan’s counsel and executed Ma Shun, then followed Lin Cong’s plan to imprison Wang Zhen. Later, he acted on Ye Sheng’s advice, relentlessly pursuing those who had failed in their duty during the imperial escort. Compared to the likes of Geng Nanzhong, Huang Qianshan, and Wang Boyan—who had no part in such schemes—his refusal to dismiss Li Gang to appease the Jin, to strip Zong Ze of his command and demoralize the loyal, or to sacrifice Yue Fei to satisfy traitors’ whims, stands in stark contrast. This is why Minister Shang the Cultured and Earnest declared: *"Emperor Jing rendered great service to the altars of state."* Was this not the reason?

As for Minister Yu’s death, it was in accordance with the principles of the *Spring and Autumn*—a debt repaid to his sovereign in the underworld.

Thus, it was said again and again: *"Leave behind but a single frame of flesh."* How could he not have known? Had there been even the slightest trace of attachment or reluctance, all his past wise counsels would have shattered like tiles, and his clarity of judgment could not have remained so resolute and bright. Alas! The bond between sovereign and minister may indeed be called righteous.

When the Loyal and Martyred Duke Sun Sui served as Regional Inspector of Jiangxi, Zhu Chenhao, the Prince of Ning, oppressed the people with tyranny, eroded governance with corruption, and secretly plotted rebellion. Upon his arrival, Duke Sun first exposed the abuses of the prince’s officers—how they harmed the good and virtuous, how treacherous commoners seized property, and how the prince’s musicians murdered in broad daylight—then petitioned for their indictment. Chenhao, fearing reprisal, shifted blame to other prefectures, while General Wang, seeking to cover his own faults, submitted memorials in self-justification. Though Duke Sun saw through this, the rebellion had not yet openly manifested, and despite his repeated memorials detailing the prince’s crimes, they were suppressed and never reached the throne. He could only secretly coordinate with Surveillance Vice Censor Li Run, Regional Inspector Fan Xia, Assistant Administration Commissioner Chen Hongmo, and Vice Commissioner Xu Da, stockpiling grain, readying troops, stationing officials at strategic points, and thus containing the prince’s movements within while suppressing his partisans without.

Later, a man of Nanchang named Zhang Yi submitted a full report to Surveillance Censor Xiao Huai, who then exposed the prince’s crimes to the court and dispatched meritorious nobles and high ministers to admonish him. Before their warning arrived, however, the prince’s officer Lin Hua galloped back from the capital with news, and Chenhao, seized by fear, rebelled. On the fourteenth day of the sixth month of the *jimao* year, during the prince’s birthday banquet, all officials entered to offer felicitations. Chenhao stood on the open terrace and declared: *"The Empress Dowager has issued a secret decree commanding me to raise troops and act as regent."* Duke Sun demanded to see the decree, but Chenhao faltered and said only: *"No need for further words. I am going to Nanjing—will you escort me?"* Duke Sun replied: *"There are not two suns in the sky; how can a minister serve two lords? Who dares defy the laws of the ancestral dynasty?"* Enraged, Chenhao withdrew into the palace hall to don his armor, then emerged and shouted at Duke Sun: *"What wrong have I done you that you impeached me seven times?"* Duke Sun retorted: *"What wrong has the court done you that you rebel?"* At that moment, all the assembled officials stood aghast.

Only Minister Xu, the Loyal and Principled Duke Kui, argued back and forth, insisting it could not be done. He raised his voice and declared: *"We are high ministers of the realm—how can we act thus?"* Enraged, Chenhao demanded: *"What does Xu Kui say?"* Xu replied: *"Only that I have a heart of red loyalty—would I follow you in rebellion?"* Thereupon Chenhao roared an order to bind the two ministers and drag them out. Xu turned to Duke Sun and said: *"Had you heeded my words earlier, this would not have come to pass."* For there had once been a plan to strike first and report afterward, but others had thwarted it.

Once bound, Xu Kui grew ever more vehement, shouting curses without cease until he was slain alongside Duke Sun. On the day of their deaths, the flames of martyrdom burned fiercely, and suddenly the sky darkened with a choking gloom; soldiers and civilians, young and old, all wept. When word reached the court, posthumous offices and honors were conferred, and a temple was ordered built to enshrine them both, its plaque inscribed: *"Exalting Loyalty."*

The record states: *"Beholding the deaths of these two ministers, we see how they above revived the unbroken heroic spirit of antiquity, and below inspired the indomitable vitality of ages to come; how they forestalled the manifest calamity of a traitor’s disloyalty, and thwarted the hidden schemes of treacherous factions. Can this be called a small contribution?*

*When Duke Sun first took office, the realm enjoyed perfect peace and prosperity—who did not believe all was secure? Yet who could have foreseen disaster rising from within the imperial house, rebellion springing from the sovereign’s own kin? Only he stood resolute against it. In life, he seemed as one already dead: seven memorials he submitted to restrain Chenhao, a hundred stratagems to clip his wings. In death, he seemed as one not dead: his forthright words exposed the traitor’s plot, his refusal to mount his horse foiled his advance. In him, composure and righteous fervor were as one—this is the first reason he is to be revered.*

*When the Martial Emperor ascended the throne, a succession of wicked factions arose, their deceits and debaucheries beyond remedy; all hearts were sick with loathing. But upon hearing the words ‘There are not two suns in the sky; how can a minister serve two lords?’—like autumn frost and scorching sun, awe-inspiring—then the hearts of those who would rebel were reformed, and the spirit of defiance grew stronger. In death for filial piety, in death for loyalty, there is an inevitability that transcends intention—this is the second reason he is to be revered.*

*In the middle period of the Han, there was the Revolt of the Seven States; in the Tang, the troops of Yuyang—both brought prolonged suffering. Even in the Ning Shu rebellion, though its schemes were deep and its evil long-nurtured, it was crushed in fifty days. Yet tracing its origins, in the Han not a single man died in resistance. In the Tang, only after twenty-four prefectures had fallen did the son of the Yan family refuse to yield to bandits—how different from today, when loyal blood splattered the traitor’s filthy chariot-wheels, when a single cry snatched away his false mandate, when the sky darkened in mourning and snow swirled in the air at a rebuke! The gentleman had long since foreseen its destruction—this is the third reason he is to be revered.*

*The great enterprise of pacifying the realm and rectifying the state seemed within reach, yet the Dao of Heaven, once manifest, was again obscured; the imperial path, once opened, was again blocked. The loyal and good had nearly despaired of averting disaster. Yet in the end, the realm suffered no lasting blemish—precisely because the hearts of men are not easily swayed. Even if men like Hou Yi or Wang Mang had arisen, their efforts would have been in vain; how much more so for such petty vermin as these! This is the fourth reason he is to be revered.*

*These four virtues—no defiance of Heaven, no lagging behind opportunity, no betrayal of self, no frustration of duty—are not small contributions. Let those who read this take heed."*

**Hongdao Record, Scroll Seventeen (conclusion)**
**Hongdao Record, Scroll Eighteen: On Righteousness—The Righteousness Between Father and Son**

Mencius said: "Shun fully practiced the Way of serving his parents, and Gu Sou* was thereby made joyful, and all under Heaven was transformed. Gu Sou being made joyful, the father-son relationship throughout the world was settled."

The Record states: What is meant by "settled"? The *Classic of Filial Piety* says: "When one man has cause for celebration, the millions of people rely upon him." For in the relationship between father and son, righteousness is often obscured. People know only of affection but not of reverence. Only now do they begin to understand the Way of revering the other, and the roles of father and son become clearly defined. This is why the customs of Qin—where fathers doted on their sons and craved profit, differing little from beasts—truly paved the way for great chaos in later ages.

The *Records of the Grand Historian* state: In the time of Yao, the floods rose to the heavens, and the Four Peaks recommended Gun to regulate the waters. He achieved no success, and Gun hastened to his death. After Shun ascended the throne, he raised up Yu to continue his father’s work.

The Record states: In the flourishing age of Tang and Yu, not only was abdication and succession carried out with perfect impartiality, but even matters of merit and fault were not concealed. Gun was a criminal. Even if a criminal’s descendant served in the same court, could he truly replace his father? Yu was a filial son. His heart, burdened with grief for his father, could scarcely bear to offer himself in service—how much less to inherit his father’s work! Yet Shun’s rescue of Gun and Gun’s being rescued both proceeded from the perfect impartiality of all under Heaven. The one who bestowed it harbored no resentment, and the one who received it felt no enmity. When Shun raised Yu to continue his father’s work, this too accorded with the perfect harmony of human hearts. The one who appointed him felt no misgivings, and the one who took up the task felt no regret. Had there been the slightest trace of self-interest, the relationships between ruler and minister, father and son, would all have been obstructed. How then could this be called righteousness?

Yu married the daughter of the Tushan clan and had a son, Qi. From the days of *xin*, *ren*, *gui*, to *jia*, Qi wailed incessantly, yet Yu, unmindful of his son, devoted himself wholly to measuring the land and managing the waters.

The Record states: Gun was dismissed for defying orders and ruining his clan, while Yu rose to prominence through his responsiveness and diligent service. If fine wine is detestable, can the human Way be abandoned? If every inch of time is precious, can even the days of *xin* and *ren* be begrudged? This is the essence of "public-mindedness forgetting the private, the state forgetting the family"—a virtue that admits of no greater height.

The *Book of Rites* in the *Tan Gong* chapter states: In serving one’s parents, one conceals their faults without defying them, attends to their needs without fixed methods, serves them diligently until death, and observes three years of mourning.

The Record states: Why must their faults be concealed? For the Way of father and son is rooted in Heavenly nature. The *Book of Changes* says: "In correcting his father’s errors, the son ensures that his father incurs no blame." Though a parent may err, if the child can rectify it, the parent’s failure becomes the child’s achievement. Thus, Shun’s father was originally obstinate, but Shun was able to guide him, and his obstinacy was transformed into kindness—how could there be any defiance? Yu’s father was originally cruel, but Yu was able to guide him, and his merits eclipsed his faults—what need was there for direct confrontation? Yet merely concealing their wrongs, to the point of bringing ruin to state and family, is not the meaning of "attending to their needs without fixed methods."

If a father’s faults are concealed to the point of national collapse and familial destruction, this is not the meaning of "attending to their needs without fixed methods." When King Cheng was too young to govern, the Duke of Zhou assisted him in ruling, and he upheld the laws of the heir apparent before Bo Qin, wishing to make King Cheng understand the Way of father and son, ruler and minister, elder and younger.

The Record states: I observe that upholding the laws of the heir apparent before Bo Qin was a stroke of genius for all ages. Though the heir apparent was a young ruler, and the tutors and guardians appointed were esteemed ministers, could a minister truly reproach a ruler? Would mere formal bows and seated courtesies convey any true sense of awe? Yet Bo Qin, as the heir to Lu, was subject to the authority of his tutors and guardians. Thus, while King Cheng could not be flogged, Bo Qin could suffer no such impropriety. Not only was there no impropriety in flogging Bo Qin, but even King Cheng could harbor no resentment. Though it was Qin who received the lashes, it was the king who was being chastised. Would this not jolt him into reflection and self-improvement? If one does not correct one’s faults, others will not cease their reproofs. Faults have limits, but reproofs are boundless—until they become fewer and fewer, and finally vanish altogether. Over time, the one who metes out the lashes may cease, and the one who commits the faults may be transformed. People see only that he became an excellent ruler, unaware of how deeply he was shaped by this process. Is this not the height of ingenuity?

Thus Confucius said: "The Duke of Zhou excelled in this." This is the highest praise.

In all the Three Dynasties, the heir apparent was educated with ritual and music. Music cultivates the inner self, while ritual cultivates the outer. When ritual and music intermingle within, they manifest outwardly. Thus, when fully realized, they produce a demeanor that is gracious, reverent, and refined.

The Record states: Above the Three Dynasties, ritual and music were put into practice. Below the Three Dynasties, they became empty formalities. The heir apparent is the foundation of all under Heaven. Ritual and music are the foundation of the heir apparent. If the heir apparent is reverent and refined, the ruler of men will be free from indolence, cruelty, and harshness. If the ruler of men is free from indolence, cruelty, and harshness, the court will be free from perversity, discord, and rebellion. If the court is free from perversity, discord, and rebellion, the world will be free from dissolution, peril, and ruin. The beginnings of early cultivation and preparation lie here, subtly guiding the realm into a state of peace and order without one’s awareness.

They appointed a Grand Tutor and a Junior Tutor to nurture him, wishing him to understand the Way of father and son, ruler and minister. The Grand Tutor examined the Way of father and son, ruler and minister, and demonstrated it to him. The Junior Tutor accompanied the heir apparent, observing the Grand Tutor’s virtuous conduct and explaining it clearly. The Grand Tutor stood before him, the Junior Tutor behind. When inside, he had guardians; when outside, he had teachers. Thus, through instruction and explanation, his virtue was perfected.

The teacher is one who teaches with affairs and elucidates virtue. The guardian is one who carefully attends to his own conduct, assists and guides him, and leads him to the Way.

The Record states: In the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, there were teachers and guardians, as well as counselors for doubts, the Four Assistants, and the Three Dukes. These positions were not necessarily all filled—only those who were capable were appointed. The establishment of teachers, guardians, and tutors was thus of such great importance.

---
*Gu Sou: Shun’s blind father.*

In later ages, these positions became mere concurrent offices—some elevated their rituals in vain, others retained only their names, some appointed unworthy individuals, while others assigned duties unrelated to their roles. None of these aligned with the original intent of the Duke of Zhou. How, then, could one expect the proper method of educating the crown prince to endure?

To the ruler, the crown prince is both a son in kinship and a lord in rank. Possessing the intimacy of a father and the authority of a sovereign, he is then entrusted with the realm. Thus, the upbringing of the crown prince must be approached with utmost care. There is but one path where a single act yields threefold virtue—this is the crown prince’s enrollment in learning. When the crown prince attends school alongside others, the people observe and ask: *"He who will rule us now shares our rank in learning—why?"* The answer: *"Because his father still lives, and thus the rites demand it."* Through this, the multitude comes to understand the Way of father and son.

Again, they ask: *"He who will rule us now shares our rank in learning—why?"* The answer: *"Because his lord still reigns, and thus the rites demand it."* Through this, the people grasp the principle of lord and subject.

A third time, they ask: *"He who will rule us now shares our rank in learning—why?"* The answer: *"Because he honors his elders."* Through this, the people learn the order of seniority and juniority.

Thus, while the father lives, he is a son; while the lord reigns, he is a subject. By observing the proper conduct of son and subject, he upholds reverence for the lord and love for kin. Therefore, in learning, he embodies the Way of father and son; in learning, he embodies the Way of lord and subject; in learning, he embodies the Way of senior and junior. When the Ways of father and son, lord and subject, senior and junior are realized, the state is well-governed.

As the saying goes: *"The Music Master oversees instruction, the Father-Teacher ensures completion. When one man is truly excellent, the myriad states attain rectitude."* This refers to the crown prince.

*Record states:* Observing the excellence of the institutions of the Zhou, none surpass the meticulous and detailed regulations for the crown prince—readers cannot but rejoice in them. Though the crown prince is born within the secluded palace and stands above ten thousand men, who would dare to share his rank? Yet who would also follow his example? Still, his birth has its origins, his succession its inheritance, and his emergence from seclusion has its precedence—these are matters the crown prince shares with all people. Though he shares these with others, who can make them understand what they share?

For most people merely know they have a father but not the Way of the father—though they revere him, they do not change. They merely know they have a lord but not the Way of the lord—though they honor him, they do not shift. They merely know they have elders but not the Way of the elder—though they exalt them, they do not alter. Yet through a single question of shared rank in learning, the subtlest principles of the realm are exhaustively revealed—is this not as clear as pointing to one’s palm?

Thus it is said: *"When one man is truly excellent, the myriad states attain rectitude."* This is the ultimate praise, boundless in its scope.

*The Garden of Persuasions* records: When Bo Qin and Kang Shu received their fiefs, they paid court to King Cheng and met the Duke of Zhou. Thrice they were received, and thrice they were dismissed. Kang Shu grew alarmed and said to Bo Qin: *"There is a worthy man named Shangzi—let us go and see him."* Kang Shu and Bo Qin visited Shangzi and sought his counsel. Shangzi said: *"On the southern slope of Mount Nan, there is a tree called *qiao*—go and observe it."* The two went and saw the *qiao*: its branches stretched upward, bearing fruit with pride. They reported this to Shangzi, who said: *"The *qiao* embodies the Way of the father."*

*"On the northern slope of Mount Nan, there is a tree called *zi*—go and observe it."* The two went and saw the *zi*: its branches bent downward, bearing fruit in humility. They reported this to Shangzi, who said: *"The *zi* embodies the Way of the son."*

The next day, the two met the Duke of Zhou. Upon entering the gate, they hastened forward; upon ascending the hall, they knelt. The Duke of Zhou stroked their heads, commended them, and offered them food, asking: *"Where have you seen a gentleman?"* They replied: *"We saw Shangzi."* The Duke of Zhou said: *"Truly a gentleman, this Shangzi!"*

*Record states:* This admonition from Bo Qin was not only to instruct King Cheng but also to instruct Kang Shu. When a household has a stern lord, reverence for the master and righteousness for the ruler are established, and the Way of loving kin is never isolated. When a household is in turmoil, misfortune and calamity follow—this is why children are exchanged for instruction. Exchanging children for instruction preserves the affection between father and son. Truly a gentleman, this Shangzi! He neither harmed affection nor lost righteousness, yet his virtue extended for ten generations—is this not the clearest proof of *"majesty enduring to a blessed end"*?

By contrast, the vulgar customs of Qin and the harsh laws of Han severed affection, while wives and children, laughing heedlessly, lost the proper order of the household. Is it any wonder that ruin and chaos followed one after another?

*The Discourses of the States* records: King Gong of Zhou was traveling along the Jing River when Mi Kang Gong followed with three fleeing women. His mother said: *"You must present them to the king. Three beasts make a herd, three people make a crowd, and three women make a gathering. A gathering is a thing of beauty. When the crowd offers a beautiful thing to you, what virtue do you possess to deserve it?"* Kang Gong did not present them. Within a year, the king destroyed Mi.

*Record states:* How deeply Mi Kang Gong’s mother loved her son, yet how blind she was to the duty of serving her lord! Though the intimacy of the hall differs from that of the knee, the singleness of the heart should be the same. If her words were meant to protect her son, they were wise. But if they were meant to advise the king, then I do not understand. Betraying one’s state is a grave crime, a great transgression against humanity. If an act is righteous, even a multitude like clouds would not be deemed excessive. If it is unrighteous, a single Bao Si was enough to destroy the House of Zhou—what difference did it make that there were three women? To regard them as firewood and present them to the king—was this the king’s beauty or Mi’s wickedness?

*The Zuo Tradition* records: In the second year of Duke Huan’s reign, he seized the bells of Bao from Song and installed them in the Grand Temple. Zang Ai Bo remonstrated: *"One who rules over others must display virtue and block transgressions to oversee the hundred officials, yet still fears some may err. Thus, he manifests exemplary virtue to instruct his descendants. This is why the Pure Temple has a thatched roof, the grand chariot has a mat of rushes, the great broth is unseasoned, and the sacrificial grain is uncarved—all to display frugality. The inner and outer robes, caps, sashes, lower garments, leggings, black slippers, jade pendants, sashes, bowstrings, and quivers—all display proper measure."*

The adornments of the carriage—*zao*, *shuai*, *zhuan*, and *xia*; the brush, whetstone, tassel, and cap strings—all display their proper number. The fire, dragon, *ling*, and *bi* patterns display their ornamentation. The five colors arranged in symbolic order display their correspondence to things. The bronze ornaments—*xi*, *luan*, *he*, and bells—display their sounds. The three celestial bodies emblazoned on the banners display their radiance. Virtue is frugal yet measured, with ascending and descending governed by precise numbers; patterns and objects serve to record it, while sounds and lights serve to manifest it, thereby illuminating the hundred officials. Thus do they remain vigilant, daring not to transgress the established laws.

Now, by obliterating virtue and erecting transgression, you enshrine these bribe-vessels in the Grand Temple, making them plainly visible to the hundred officials. If the hundred officials emulate this, what punishment could suffice? The ruin of the state arises from the corruption of its officials; the corruption of officials stems from the flaunting of favor and bribes. With the *Du* cauldrons installed in the temple, what display could be more egregious? The duke did not heed the advice.

When the Inner Scribe of Zhou heard of this, he said: "Will Zang Sun Da not have descendants in Lu?" Though the lord transgressed, he did not forget to admonish him with virtue.

The record states: Zang Ai Bo’s posterity was due to Zang Xi Bo’s exhortation. For to observe fish is to indulge in trivial excess, while to display the grand chariot is to invite greater disorder—Yu Fu’s regard for Hua Du was but a single inquiry. Once the chaos in Song had taken root, how could the villainy in Lu be redressed? Though the charges were formally returned, Duke Huan’s guilt was foremost in instigating it, while the calamity in the chariot was but a reversal of fortune. Thus did Ziya, Qingfu, Zhong Sui, and Yiru arise, their schemes proliferating without end. Was this not the consequence of making law the province of the noble?

Alas!

The descendants of the Zang clan may truly be said to have borne no disgrace to Lu. Among their later generations, some—like Zang Rangyi—faced urgent illness with equanimity, some—like those driven from the Eastern Gate—were exiled, and some were even hailed as sages. Was the prediction of the Zhou court historian mere empty words? Only then does one realize that advocating virtue and establishing principles, though they may go unheeded, must never be abandoned.

When Zhou Xu failed to harmonize with his people, Hou sought counsel from Shi Zi on how to secure his lord’s position. Shi Zi replied, “An audience with the king would suffice.” Hou asked, “How might one obtain such an audience?” Shi Zi said, “Duke Huan of Chen currently enjoys the king’s favor, and Chen and Wei are on good terms. If you go to Chen and request their intercession, the audience will surely be granted.” Hou followed Zhou Xu to Chen, where Shi Qing informed the Chen court: “Our state of Wei is small, and I am old and feeble, unable to do much. These two men murdered our ruler—dare we not act against them?” The men of Chen seized them and requested Wei’s presence to carry out the execution. In the ninth month, Wei dispatched Youzai Chou to Pu, where he put Zhou Xu to death. Shi Ge then sent his steward Ru Yangjian to Chen to execute Shi Hou. The noble man remarked: “Shi Ge was a loyal minister indeed. Though he despised Zhou Xu, he included Hou in his condemnation. To uphold great righteousness by cutting off even one’s kin—is this not the very meaning of such loyalty?”

The record states: The sacrificial rites of La nearly enabled one to join in rebellion. For perversity and drowning alike lead to destruction. The lord had already strayed into perversity, and Cuo nearly drowned in it. Had a true king arisen, how could he have been purified? Then what use were the earlier remonstrances? When Huan ascended and Cuo grew old, when Hou died and Shi was at peace, Cuo nearly became fit to join in rebellion. Had Huo Guang of Han understood this and plainly informed the emperor, saying, “Lady Xian was complicit in the regicide,” then the crime of Chun Yu could have been righted, the marriage of the younger daughter halted, and the Huo clan might not have perished. Yet in the end, they drowned together—was this not due to a failure to study? Thus it is said: A minister who does not grasp the principles of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* risks falling into the crime of usurpation or regicide. This is what it means.

When Duke Xian of Jin sought to kill his heir, Prince Shensheng, his brother Chong’er said to him, “Why not explain your intentions to the duke?” The heir replied, “I cannot. If the duke finds comfort in Lady Li, I would only wound his heart.” Chong’er then asked, “Then why not flee?” Shensheng said, “I cannot. The duke would believe I meant to murder him. Is there any state in the world without a father?” He sent a message to Hu Tu, saying: “Shensheng has erred and failed to heed your counsel, bringing himself to death. I dare not cling to life. Yet our lord is old, his son young, and the state beset by troubles. If you do not emerge to guide our lord, who will? If you do emerge to guide him, Shensheng will accept my fate and die.” He bowed twice, kowtowed, and then perished. Thus he is called the Reverent Heir.

The record states: Duke Xian’s lack of kindness could be punished by others, but his lack of filial piety could not. For father and son succeed one another as generations. Thus Heaven, in bestowing its mandate, first determines their union and rightly orders their succession. What is this union if not the household’s inner sanctum? How could it be profaned? How grievous was the Reverent Heir’s misfortune! The way of beasts is to wait passively—Heaven casts them into the dust to serve as offerings for man’s slaughter. Yet man is the most intelligent of creatures, and among men, the finest are chosen. Though the world may rarely lack states without fathers, can it abide men without mothers? To be deluded by Lady Li might still be spoken of, but to be deceived by Lady Qi—this cannot be spoken of. The heir must have weighed this. Heaven punishes the unfilial to warn the unworthy—how could I dare to cling to life? With no path forward, I await the cauldron. Shensheng’s reverence lay in his resolve to yield his place to his successor.

The duke sent the eunuch Pi to attack Pu. Chong’er said, “A command from one’s lord and father must not be resisted.” He then fled, saying, “To resist would be my warning.” He scaled the wall and escaped, but Pi cut off his sleeve. Chong’er then fled to Di.

The record states: Chong’er was nearly fit to face peril. For a command from one’s lord and father must not be resisted—resistance serves as a fivefold warning. When the Crown Prince of Wei was exiled, Shi De instructed him to falsify credentials, and Shou Chong and others were imprisoned—was this not a warning? To accept a light punishment but flee a heavy one—this is the way of a filial son. Though he scaled the wall and fled to Di, how did this harm his conduct in escaping danger?

When Duke Xiang of Jin died, Lady Mu Ying carried the heir in her arms and wept at court, crying, “What crime did the late lord commit? What crime does his heir commit? To set aside the rightful heir and seek a ruler from outside—where will this lead?” She left the court and went to the Zhao clan, where she kowtowed to Xuanzi, saying, “The late lord entrusted this child to you, saying, ‘If this son is capable, I will owe you a debt of gratitude. If he is not, I will hold you in resentment.’ Now, though the lord has passed, his words still ring in my ears—how can you abandon him?” Xuanzi and the other ministers, troubled by Lady Mu Ying and fearing the power of the outer clans, disregarded Xian Mie and enthroned Duke Ling.

The record states: Duke Ling’s plot against Zhao Dun did not wait for repeated remonstrances—it began the moment he heard the kowtow. For a lord to kowtow to his minister is a grave humiliation. Why did Dun not reflect on his own conduct? By diminishing his private authority and restoring governance to the public realm, yet remaining blind to the principles of advancement and retreat, survival and ruin, he invited regret with every move.

Some say: Duke Ling of Jin was lawless—had Xuanzi withdrawn, would he not have perished? Zhuge Liang said: “A minister exhausts himself in service until death.” As for success or failure, advantage or setback—these lie beyond a minister’s foresight. If this principle is not understood, then the clamor of voices—like a demon striking a locust tree, or Mi Ming dying beneath the great mulberry, or Ling Zhe reversing his halberd at the crossroads—seems to blame the minister, but how could one advance under such circumstances?

When the Inner Scribe of Zhou, Shu Fu, arrived in Lu, Gongsun Ao heard of his skill in physiognomy. Upon meeting his two sons, Shu Fu declared: "Gu will bring hardship upon his father. As for Shou, Gu—his broad jaw foretells that his descendants shall prosper in the state of Lu."

Gu fathered Mie, Mie fathered Su, Su fathered Jie, and Jie fathered Jue, who became known as Xi Zi. As Xi Zi lay dying, he summoned his ministers and said: "Kong Qiu is a descendant of sages. Zhuang Sun He once observed: 'If a sage of luminous virtue does not flourish in his own time, his descendants are certain to produce an eminent figure.' Now, that eminent one may well be Kong Qiu. Should I pass away, I entrust Shuo and He Ji to study under the Master, that they may learn ritual and secure their standing."

Thus, Meng Yi Zi and Nan Gong Jing Shu became Confucius’ disciples. Confucius said: "One who can redress his errors is a noble man." The record notes: This lord was a descendant of Qing Fu, yet Confucius praised him as one who could redress errors, thereby exemplifying instruction. For the virtuous, this is the Way to ensure posterity. You Zi examined the matter and found no fault—such is the Way of rectification. The Duke of Zhou charged Cai Zhong, saying: "You must strive to atone for the transgressions of your forebears." This expresses the same principle.

Viewed together, one sees how the sage embraces all under Heaven’s goodness.

Duke Wen of the Ji clan served as chief minister of Lu, keeping no concubines clad in silk nor horses fed with grain. Zhongsun Ta remonstrated, saying: "You, my lord, are Lu’s highest minister, having served two rulers. Yet your concubines wear no silk, and your horses eat no grain—will others not deem this miserly and unworthy of a state’s splendor?"

Wen replied: "I, too, would wish otherwise. Yet when I observe the people of our state, many among their fathers and elder brothers still eat coarse fare and wear shabby clothes. How dare I adorn my concubines and horses? Moreover, I have heard that a state’s splendor lies in the glory of virtue, not in the finery of concubines and horses."

Wen later recounted this to Meng Xian Zi, who imprisoned Ta for seven days. Thereafter, the concubines of Zifu (Ta’s courtesy name) wore only cloth of seven *sheng* weave, and their horses’ fodder was no better than piled chaff. When Wen heard of this, he declared: "One who corrects his errors is the people’s superior." He then appointed him to the rank of senior grand master.

Zifu was Ta’s courtesy name, the son of Mie.

The record notes: When Duke Kang of Liu paid a visit to Lu and presented gifts to the ministers, both Ji Wen Zi and Meng Xian Zi were frugal. Upon returning, he told the king: "The Ji and Meng clans must have long resided in Lu—they are reverent, diligent, respectful, and thrifty. As ministers, they uphold reverence to fulfill their duties without fail, and with diligence they guard their offices without slack."

The practice of reverence in service ensures leniency in death; the practice of frugality in sufficiency keeps one far from worry. When superiors and subordinates share no rifts, what task cannot be borne? This is how one earns a lasting reputation across generations. These words align perfectly with such principles.

Gongfu Wenbo returned from court and paid his respects to his mother. His mother was spinning thread at the time. Wenbo said, "With a household as grand as Chou’s, how can its mistress still be spinning?" His mother sighed and said, "Is Lu doomed? Has my son, now an official, truly heard nothing of duty? Sit, and I will tell you. When the people toil, they reflect; reflection gives rise to good intentions. When they grow idle, they turn to excess; excess makes them forget goodness, and forgetting goodness breeds evil intentions. The people of fertile lands lack ability because of excess; the people of barren lands are all upright because of toil. Thus, the queen personally tends the black silk, the wives of dukes and marquises add silk cords to their robes, the wives of ministers wear grand sashes as titled ladies, the wives of officers completing sacrificial robes wear court attire, and from the common officers downward, all women clothe their husbands. At the altar, they present their tasks; in mourning, they offer their achievements. Transgressions incur punishment—this was the system of old. I hoped you would attend to my teachings day and night, saying, ‘I must not fail our ancestors.’ Yet now you ask, ‘Why not seek ease?’ Entrusted with the lord’s office, I fear for the extinction of Mubo’s line."

The record notes: Observing Yixiu’s abandonment of weaving and Jing Jiang’s diligent spinning—is there any difference? None. The distinction between men and women lies in inner and outer roles, while the warnings of rise and fall lie in excess and responsibility. In office, one’s treasure is to avoid arrogance; at home, one’s treasure is to avoid indulgence. As a minister, Yi could not harbor even the suspicion of seeking gain; as a mother, Jing Jiang could not entertain the poison of complacency. As for Wenbo—outwardly lacking devotion to public duty, inwardly burdened by excessive desires—his ruin is near. That his mother’s words were not only worth hearing but also trustworthy marks her as a paragon of the household. No wonder she was posthumously titled "Reverent Jiang."

When Fan Wuzi was about to retire, he summoned his son, Xie, and said, "Xie, I have heard that those whose joy and anger follow their nature are few, while those who let them run wild are many. A noble person’s joy and anger do not disrupt themselves; if they disrupt others, it will only worsen. Perhaps Quezi seeks to disrupt himself in Qi? If not, I fear he will only amplify it. I am about to retire, so let Quezi fulfill his ambitions—perhaps he will distinguish himself. You, follow the other ministers and remain reverent." He then requested retirement, and Que Xianzi took office.

Wenzi returned from court at dusk. Wuzi asked, "Why so late?" He replied, "A Qin envoy delivered a speech in court, and none of the ministers could respond. I knew three points." Wuzi grew angry and said, "The ministers are not incapable—they defer to their elders. You, a mere youth, have upstaged them all in court. If I were not in Jin, the state would perish any day now!" He struck him with his staff.

Later, when Quezi attacked Qi and the army returned victorious, Wenzi entered last. Wuzi said, "Did you not wish to await my gaze?" He replied, "The army had achieved merit, and the people rejoiced. To greet them first would have drawn all attention to me—usurping the commander’s renown. Thus, I dared not." Wuzi said, "I know you are safe now." Therefore, Wenzi governed with a fine reputation, and Jin relied upon him.

The record notes: Observing Hui’s instruction to Xie, I now understand why some great clans endure while others perish. The Hu, Zhao, Ji, Bu, Yue, Fan, and Jin—these were the so-called great clans. When a clan grows large, excess arises; excess breeds arrogance, and arrogance invites resentment. These are the ones to fear, not to rely upon. And if one further indulges in joy and anger? Thus, Chuan’s regicide was not due to the attack at Taolin but to the battle at Hequ. Bu’s downfall was not due to Xu Tong’s plot but to the humiliation by his wife. Wuzi saw this clearly. Had Dun not restrained his reckless schemes to curb his arrogance and favor, the calamity of the lower officials might have been averted. Had Xian not suppressed his resentful and covetous heart to temper his competitive nature, the guilt of the three Que might have been avoided. How wise! Following Wuzi’s example, he instructed his son with reverence and deference. Reverence gathers virtue; deference exalts propriety. With reverence, Dun did not act wantonly; with deference, Xie did not boast. Later, at the Battle of Junling, he conducted himself with composure and correctness, preserving the fine reputation of Gai Yang’s lineage. How does this compare to the Hu, Zhao, Yue, and Que?

Wei Xianzi said to Cheng Zhuan, "If I ally with Wu, will the people of the county not see me as partisan?" Zhuan replied, "Wu’s character is such that he does not forget his lord when distant, nor does he flaunt agreement when near. In prosperity, he thinks of righteousness; in hardship, he thinks of purity. He has a steadfast heart and no wanton conduct. Even if you ally with him, is it not fitting?" Later, when the people of Gengyang had a lawsuit, their clan bribed the court with female musicians. Weizi was about to accept them. Wei Wu said to Yan Mo and Nü Kuan, "Our lord is known among the feudal lords for refusing bribes. If he accepts the bribe from Gengyang, nothing could be worse. You must remonstrate." Both agreed.

After court, they waited in the courtyard. When summoned, they sighed three times before entering. Once seated, Weizi said, "I have heard that only eating can make one forget worries. You have sighed three times during the meal—why?" They replied, "Earlier, someone gave us two lowly ones wine, and we did not eat until evening. When the food was first served, we feared it would be insufficient, hence the first sigh. Midway, we reproached ourselves, thinking, ‘How could the general’s meal be inadequate?’ and sighed again. By the end, we wished to make our bellies like the hearts of gentlemen—content with mere fullness." Xianzi declined the bribe.

The record notes: A father should not demand goodness from his son—Wei Wu could be said to have known how to heed remonstrance.

No one knows a minister better than his lord, just as no one knows a son better than his father. Xianzi may be said to have known how to employ others. Subtle words and artful persuasion allow speakers to speak without fear and listeners to accept readily. The two may be said to have known how to use speech.

Yet what suspicion is there to avoid, that one should be so earnestly concerned with the turning of words? Excellent indeed! Master Cheng said: "Those who avoid suspicion are all inwardly deficient. When one is inwardly sufficient, why would one resort to bribes?" This is why his governance among the noble aroused no surprise.

To follow beasts without satiety, only to incur the censure of *qiao* and *guo*, cannot be called loyalty. In the *Analects*, Chen Gang asked Boyu, "Have you received any special teachings?" He replied, "Not yet. Once, when he stood alone, I hurried past the courtyard. He asked, 'Have you studied the *Poetry*?' I replied, 'Not yet.' He said, 'Without studying the *Poetry*, one has no means of speech.' I withdrew and studied the *Poetry*. Another time, when he stood alone, I hurried past the courtyard. He asked, 'Have you studied the rites?' I replied, 'Not yet.' He said, 'Without studying the rites, one has no means of standing.' I withdrew and studied the rites."

Upon hearing these two exchanges, Chen Gang withdrew and rejoiced, saying, "I asked one question and gained three insights: I learned of the *Poetry*, the rites, and that the noble man keeps his distance from his son." The record notes: Boyu’s responses contained five virtues, though keeping distance from his son was not among them. "Once, when he stood alone"—the moment was leisurely and fitting, with nothing to shame him above or trouble him below. "Hurried"—his manner was reverent and solemn, without familiarity from favor or reliance on affection. *Poetry* and rites are public matters. "Not yet"—he knew and did not deceive, without laziness or arrogance. "Without... one has no means"—his words were generous and accommodating, without demanding goodness or harming affection. As for "withdrew and studied," he was then fully cultivated.

Even in his "not yet," the question of difference revealed something profoundly different within. How regrettable that Chen Gang’s perception did not reach this! At first, he peered with private intent; in the end, he rejoiced at a small gain. That a thousand years later, one cannot help but lament Boyu’s missed opportunity—is this not Chen Gang’s fault?

The *Complete Works* claims that Boyu’s nature was somewhat inferior, so the Sage taught him only thus. Had his nature been keen and perceptive, he might have reached the heights of Yan and Zeng. This statement does not seem correct.

In the *Family Sayings*: Once, when Master Zeng lay gravely ill, Zichun of Lezheng sat by the bed, while Zeng Yuan and Zeng Shen sat at his feet. A boy holding a candle sat in the corner. The boy said, "How splendid and smooth—is that the mat of a great officer?" Zichun said, "Stop." Master Zeng heard this and started, saying, "How splendid and smooth—is that the waking mat of a great officer?" Master Zeng said, "Yes. This was a gift from Jisun. I have not yet been able to replace it." Yuan rose to change the mat. Zeng Yuan said, "The Master’s illness is critical. We cannot risk waiting until dawn. Please change it with reverence." Master Zeng said, "Your love for me is not like that of a noble man. A noble man loves others with virtue; you love with indulgence. What more do I seek? I wish only to die rightly. That is all."

They lifted him to change the mat, but before he could settle back upon the new one, he passed away.

The record states: What is meant by "parents preserve one whole at birth, and a child returns whole to them" is thus explained. The foundation of life’s principle lies in wholeness—how could it be merely a matter of "extending my feet" or "moving my hands"? From the Three Reflections to his final illness, from transmitting the teachings to grasping the One Thread, from yielding his seat to awaiting the candle’s light—had there been even the slightest deviation from rightness, it could not be called a whole return. Otherwise, would the Heaven-endowed conscience be deemed lighter than the body bequeathed by one’s parents? Thus, only after the mat was changed did I know he had avoided failure.

If he had merely allowed his disciples to part the bedding and look upon him, it would have been a trivial matter.

In *The Elementary Learning*, it is recorded: Meng Ke’s mother lived near a graveyard. When Mencius was young, his play consisted of grave-digging and burial rites. His mother said, "This is no place to raise a child," and they moved away. They then lived near a market, where his play turned to hawking and bargaining. His mother said, "This is no place to raise a child," and they moved again, settling beside a school. There, his play became arranging ritual vessels, bowing, yielding, advancing, and retiring. His mother said, "This is truly a place to raise a child," and they remained.

The record states: Confucius, in his play, always arranged ritual vessels and practiced ceremonial deportment, rooted in innate knowledge. Mencius, in his play, also arranged ritual vessels, bowed, yielded, advanced, and retired, but this was rooted in learning. Herein lies the distinction between the great sage and the great worthy, determined from the time they were mere lads.

In *The Comprehensive Mirror*, it is recorded: Suo Gao of Anling had a son who served in Qin. Qin appointed him to guard Guan. When Lord Xinling of Wei attacked Guan without success, he sent word to the Lord of Anling: "Send Suo Gao to me. I will appoint him as a Fifth-Rank Grandee and make him a Commandant of Credentials." The Lord of Anling conveyed this to Suo Gao, who replied, "Your lordship’s favor toward me is to have me attack Guan. A father attacking while his son defends—this would be a laughingstock. To appear before you in submission would be to betray my lord. A father teaching his son to betray—this is hardly what your lordship would desire." He bowed twice, declined the messenger, and reported back to Lord Xinling. Enraged, Lord Xinling sent another messenger to the Lord of Anling, saying, "The land of Anling is as much a part of Wei as any other. If I fail to take Guan, Qin’s forces will reach us, and our altars of soil and grain will be imperiled. I ask that you bind Suo Gao and send him to me. If you refuse, I will dispatch a hundred thousand troops to lay siege to Anling." The Lord of Anling replied, "Our former lord, Marquis Cheng, received a decree from King Xiang to guard this city. He was handed the statutes of the Grand Treasury, which stated: 'Even if the state grants a general amnesty or a city surrenders, a son may not partake in it.' Now Suo Gao has declined high office to preserve the righteousness between father and son, yet you demand that I forcibly send him. This would make me violate King Xiang’s decree and abolish the statutes of the Grand Treasury. Though I die, I dare not comply." When Suo Gao heard this, he said, "Lord Xinling is fierce, impetuous, and self-willed. If I refuse and he retaliates, it will bring disaster to the state. I have already preserved my own integrity and not violated righteousness—how can I allow my lord to suffer Wei’s calamity?" He then slit his own throat and died.

The record states: Anling’s refusal to send Suo Gao was not superior to Hou Ying’s counsel to Lord Xinling? To accept a father’s favor, follow a lord’s command, and thereby attain high office—even a commoner would feel shame. Yet to instruct one’s minister to defy his lord’s command in pursuit of a vainglorious victory—would Hou Ying willingly do such a thing? The usurpations of Wang Mang, the fall of the Ji clan to Yin, the treachery of Zhai Yi, the betrayal of Bi Chen, and the cunning of Wuji—all were incited by Ying’s machinations. Had Wuji succeeded in his rebellion, could Ying have escaped blame? Could Zhai Yi have been rewarded? Could the Ji clan have treated it as child’s play? Could Bi Chen have remained idle? Thus we know that when a true king does not arise, such chaos emerges. The punishment of beheading without pardon—was this an excessive measure on the part of the sages?

During the rebellion of Tan Chi in Qi, King Min fled, and Wangsun Jia followed him. Later, they lost track of the king’s whereabouts. His mother said, "When you leave in the morning and return at dusk, I wait by the gate for you. When you leave at dusk and do not return, I wait by the lane for you. Now you serve the king, and the king has fled—yet you do not know where he is. Where, then, will you return?" Wangsun Jia then attacked and killed Tan Chi. Thereupon, Qi’s ministers sought King Min’s son, Fa Zhang, and enthroned him as the King of Qi. They defended Ju City against Yan.

The record states: What of Wangsun Jia’s mother compared to Lord Mengchang? In peacetime, he stole the state’s reputation, basking in glory and peril alike, acting as he pleased. Yet when the state was broken and the king fled, did he give it even a moment’s thought? That he ultimately killed Tan Chi, enthroned King Xiang, and defended Ju City against Yan—all was spurred by his mother’s sense of righteousness. Thus, those who wield the brush may well die of shame.

Some say: King Min wished to dismiss Wen, but Wen fled to Wei, so it was too late. I say: Could King Min truly have done so? Above, he saw not Heaven; below, he saw not Earth; in between, he saw not men—yet he saw Wen. Could King Min truly have done so? Then his mother’s words must have already planted the seed.

**On the Virtue of Father and Son**

From *The History of the Western Han*: During the reign of Emperor Wen, Jia Yi submitted a memorial stating: The Xia, Yin, and Zhou dynasties ruled as Sons of Heaven for dozens of generations, while the Qin, though also a Son of Heaven, perished after only two. Human nature is not so different—why then did the rulers of the Three Dynasties enjoy such long reigns through the Dao, while the Qin collapsed under tyranny? In ancient times, when the heir apparent was born, he was raised with ritual propriety. The officials, robed in solemn attire, presented him at the southern suburbs, and whenever he passed the palace gates, he dismounted; when he passed the ancestral temple, he hastened his steps. Thus, from infancy, he was taught the proper conduct. As soon as he could recognize things, the Three Dukes and Three Minors were appointed to instruct him in filial piety, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual, guiding him in the Dao while keeping him from evil influences. The court selected upright scholars from across the land—those of filial devotion, fraternal respect, broad learning, and mastery of the Dao—to attend him, sharing his residence and accompanying him in all his comings and goings. Thus, from birth, the heir apparent heard only upright words and walked only the right path, surrounded on all sides by virtuous men. This was why the Three Dynasties endured so long: they ensured the heir apparent was nurtured with such care. The Qin, however, did otherwise. They appointed Zhao Gao to tutor Hu Hai in the ways of the prison, so that all he learned was the execution of men—be it beheading, mutilation, or the extermination of entire clans. Thus, when Hu Hai ascended the throne, he began by shooting men for sport the very next day. Those who offered loyal remonstrance were branded as slanderers; those who probed his intentions were accused of uttering ominous words. To him, killing men was as effortless as reaping grass. Was this merely because Hu Hai was inherently evil? No—it was because the path he was led down was not the true Dao.

The *Record* states: Jia Yi’s memorial was profoundly prescient. In antiquity, the eldest sons of the Son of Heaven, the sons of the nobility, and even the most promising youths from the common folk all entered the Grand Academy, where they were taught the Dao of exhausting principle, rectifying the mind, cultivating the self, and governing others. By the decline of the Zhou, the teachings had decayed, and the Dao had long been abandoned—not only in the Qin. Even with Emperor Wen’s virtue, he could not heed Jia Yi’s counsel, a matter of deep regret for the noble-minded. Thus, this account is preserved here. Later, Emperor Jing executed ministers, altered the succession of the heir apparent, deposed and enthroned empresses, and indulged his favored younger brother—nearly repeating the Qin’s missteps. Who then could dismiss Jia Yi’s warnings as the folly of youth?

The Grand Mentor Shi Fen retired to his home, and whenever he passed the palace gates, he would dismount and hasten his steps; upon seeing the emperor’s carriage, he would bow in respect. When his sons and grandsons, who served as minor officials, returned to pay their respects, Shi Fen would receive them in full court attire, addressing them not by name. If they had faults, he would not rebuke them directly but would sit at the table without eating. Only then would his sons reproach one another, and the elders would bare their shoulders in apology, vowing to reform. Only after this would he permit his grown grandsons to remain in his presence. Even in private, he wore his cap with solemn dignity, while his servants and attendants were ever cheerful and reverent. When the court bestowed food upon his household, he would bow deeply and eat as though in the emperor’s presence. In mourning, his grief was profound, and his descendants followed his example. The Shi family became renowned across commanderies and kingdoms for their filial piety and reverence, so much so that even the Confucian scholars of Qi and Lu, famed for their moral conduct, considered themselves inferior.

His eldest son, Jian, served as Prefect of the Palace Gentlemen; his youngest, Qing, as Prefect of the Capital. When Jian was old and gray, Shi Fen was still in good health. Every five days, Jian would return home for his rest day, entering his son’s quarters in secret to inquire of the attendants. He would personally tend to his son’s garments and even clean his chamber pot, then return it to the servants, never letting Shi Fen know—this was his regular practice. Once, Qing returned home drunk and did not dismount at the outer gate. Shi Fen, upon hearing of this, refused to eat. Qing, terrified, bared his shoulders in apology, but Shi Fen would not forgive him. The entire clan, including his elder brother Jian, bared their shoulders in remorse. Shi Fen rebuked them, saying: "When a high official of the palace enters a village, even the elders flee in haste—yet the Prefect of the Capital sits in his carriage as though nothing were amiss. Is this not cause for apology?" He then dismissed Qing and his sons, ordering them to walk home from the village gate. Only then did he relent.

The *Record* states: Observing the aftermath of the Qin’s destruction, when even the families of executed criminals were eradicated, and yet the Shi family upheld such ritual propriety, one glimpses the innate nature of the human heart. Had men like him been entrusted with the education of the heir apparent and the instruction of the feudal lords—following the example of Bo Qin’s strict discipline of the crown prince—would not the customs of the Han dynasty have been nearly cured? Yet how lamentable that they merely saw the effortless practice of personal conduct as insignificant, unaware that it was not mere empty words of "serene mystery" but the very essence of inborn nature and practical utility. They grew weary of the ornate discourses of the Confucians, never realizing that these were rooted in the fundamental virtues inherent to human nature.

Appointing Jian as Chamberlain for Attendants and Qing as Prefect of the Capital—such posts of court service and fiscal administration—how much benefit could they truly bring to the state? No wonder Yi lamented with bitter tears. Let this be recorded.

Jin Midi was originally the eldest son of the Xiongnu chieftain Xiutu. His mother, Lady Guan, instructed her children with strict discipline. Midi revered his mother and practiced filial devotion. Emperor Wu, hearing of this, commended him and ordered his portrait painted in the Gansui Palace. Each time Midi passed the painting, he would bow and weep before departing. Later, Midi’s eldest son became a playmate of Emperor Wu. As the boy grew older, he once frolicked with palace women beneath the hall. Midi, chancing upon the scene, killed him on the spot. The emperor was enraged, but when Midi explained his reasons, the emperor wept and came to respect him even more.

Let this be recorded: Observing Midi’s conduct, one realizes that even among the barbarians, familial bonds endure, unlike in the Central States where they have vanished. The merits of Cheng Ji and the loyalty of Xuan Meng went unmemorialized—was this not due to the licentiousness of Yuan Tong and Ping Kuo with Lady Zhuang? The descendants of Kang Shu and the lineage of Zhurong were utterly extinguished—was this not because of Gongzi Wan’s incest with his lord’s mother? What place was this, if not the palace hall? What manner of women were these, to be treated with such familiarity as if no one would hear? Midi and [Hu] Guang were equally unlearned—was it that Guang lacked refinement while Midi possessed discernment? The difference lay solely in resolve or hesitation, in forbearance or its absence. Thus it is said: "To hesitate when one should act is to invite chaos." And again: "Lack of restraint in small matters disrupts great plans." These words require no study to comprehend.

Wei Xian and his son Xuancheng both rose to the rank of Chancellor through mastery of the Classics. Hence the saying in Zou and Lu: "Leaving your son gold is not as good as leaving him a single Classic." Xian was simple and frugal, devoted to learning, and renowned as a great Confucian. Summoned as an Erudite, he was ordered to instruct the emperor in the *Book of Songs*. During Emperor Xuan’s reign, he was held in high esteem. In the third year of *Benshi*, he became Chancellor and was enfeoffed as Marquis of Fuyang. After five years in office, he petitioned to retire due to old age and illness. The resignation of a Chancellor began with Xian. Xuancheng was even more modest and deferential to scholars. His elder brother Hong, serving as Assistant to the Minister of Ceremonies, was the rightful heir, but when Xian fell gravely ill, the family favored Xuancheng. The emperor issued an edict summoning him for investiture, yet Xuancheng declined, only accepting the title under duress. Emperor Xuan admired his integrity and appointed him Governor of Henan, while Hong became Governor of Donghai.

Initially, the emperor favored his concubine Zhang Jie, whose son, Prince Xian of Huaiyang, excelled in governance and was well-versed in law. The emperor marveled at his talent and considered naming him heir, yet the crown prince had risen from humble origins and lost his mother early, so the emperor could not bear to replace him. After some time, wishing to subtly influence the prince, he assigned Xuancheng—known for his propriety and deference—as Commandant of Huaiyang. When Emperor Yuan ascended the throne, Xuancheng succeeded his father as Chancellor within a decade and was enfeoffed as a marquis. Thus, their family’s glory flourished in that era.

Let this be recorded: In the Han dynasty, only Gongsun [Hong] and the Wei father and son held the Chancellorship through mastery of the Classics. Xian, though aged, wielded authority for five years before retiring—a matter of praise in his time. How could one expect him to propose reforms? Xuancheng served for seven years, maintaining integrity and prudence, though not matching his father’s steadfastness; his literary grace, however, surpassed it. The Chancellorship is a role that upholds Heaven and Earth above and nurtures the myriad things below—should it be reduced to mere literary display? Yet this was the criterion for selecting scholars. Thus, throughout the Han, no Chancellor left a mark on governance; they either timidly preserved themselves or followed old precedents. No wonder the Way of governance stagnated at this level.

In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, Sima Tan served during the *Jianyuan* and *Yuanfeng* eras. Distressed that scholars failed to grasp the essentials and their teachers led them astray, he analyzed the key doctrines of the Six Schools: Yin-Yang, Confucian, Mohist, Logicians, Legalists, and Daoists. The Grand Scribe oversaw the celestial offices and did not govern the people. He had a son named Qian, born in Longmen, who herded livestock on the northern slopes of the Yellow River. At ten, he recited ancient texts; at twenty, he journeyed south to the Jiang and Huai, ascended Mount Kuaiji, explored Yu’s cave, visited Jiuyi, and sailed the Yuan and Xiang rivers. He traveled north to the Wen and Si, studied in the capitals of Qi and Lu, observed Confucius’s legacy, and passed through Liang and Chu before returning. Thereafter, Qian served as a Gentleman of the Palace and was dispatched on a mission to the lands south of Ba and Shu, returning to report. That year, the emperor initiated the Feng and Shan sacrifices for the Han house, but the Grand Scribe was detained in Zhounan and could not participate. Frustrated, he fell ill and died. His son Qian had just returned from his mission and met his father in the region of the Yellow and Luo rivers. The Grand Scribe took Qian’s hand and wept, saying: "Our ancestors were Grand Scribes of the Zhou house. From ancient times, they achieved renown under Yu and Xia, overseeing the celestial offices. In later generations, our line declined..."

The present Son of Heaven has inherited a lineage spanning a thousand generations and performed the Feng sacrifice upon Mount Tai, yet I was not permitted to accompany him—such is fate. When I die, you must become the Grand Scribe. As Grand Scribe, do not forget what I wished to discuss and record. The world extols the Duke of Zhou for his ability to eulogize the virtue of Kings Wen and Wu, propagate the customs of the Zhou and Shao, and convey the aspirations of King Tai and King Ji, extending even to Gong Liu in reverence for Hou Ji. After the reigns of You and Li, the royal Way declined, rites and music decayed, and Confucius compiled the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, which scholars to this day take as their standard. More than four hundred years have passed since the capture of the unicorn, during which the feudal lords annexed one another, and the historical records have fallen into disuse. Now, with the rise of the Han, the realm is unified under one rule. Yet I, as Grand Scribe, have failed to record the enlightened sovereigns, worthy rulers, loyal ministers, and those who died for righteousness. To neglect the literary heritage of the world fills me with dread—you must take heed!

Qian bowed his head, tears streaming, and said: "Though this unworthy son lacks talent, I will exhaustively record all that my father has arranged and preserved, without daring to omit anything."

Three years later, Qian was appointed Grand Scribe and meticulously examined the records stored in the stone chambers and golden caskets. He did not abandon his father’s words, for what he undertook was to narrate past events and order the traditions of the ages—this was not creation, but transmission. Thus, he arranged and composed his work.

After seven years, he suffered the disaster of Li Ling. Retreating, he deeply pondered the subtle meanings of the *Book of Songs* and the *Book of Documents*, determined to fulfill his aspirations. In ancient times, King Wen of Zhou was imprisoned at Youli and expounded the *Book of Changes*; Confucius was besieged between Chen and Cai and composed the *Spring and Autumn Annals*; Qu Yuan was exiled and wrote the *Li Sao*; Zuo Qiu lost his sight and produced the *Discourses of the States*; Sun Bin had his kneecaps removed and discussed *The Art of War*; Lü Buwei was banished to Shu, and his *Lüshi Chunqiu* was transmitted to later generations; Han Fei was imprisoned in Qin and wrote *Shui Nan* and *Gu Fen*. The three hundred poems of the *Book of Songs* were, for the most part, the works of worthies and sages giving vent to their indignation. Thus, by recounting past events, one contemplates those to come.

He ultimately traced the lineage from the era of Emperor Yao to the capture of the unicorn, beginning with the Yellow Emperor. He composed twelve *Basic Annals*, ten *Tables*, eight *Treatises*, thirty *Hereditary Houses*, and seventy *Biographies*, totaling one hundred and thirty chapters. These he deposited in the famous mountains and kept a copy in the capital, awaiting the sage-kings and noble scholars of later ages.

**Record:** According to Sima Qian’s own account: The Han succeeded the legacy of the Five Emperors and continued the heritage of the Three Dynasties. The Qin destroyed ancient texts, scattering the archives of the Bright Hall, golden caskets, stone chambers, jade tablets, and maps. After the rise of the Han, Xiao He, Han Xin, Zhang Cang, and Shusun Tong, over the course of a hundred years, gradually advanced the refinement of literature. The *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* began to reappear. At that time, no remnant texts or ancient affairs were not gathered by the Grand Scribe, who continued the compilation of his office. Though he had received this duty by inheritance, he was still driven by indignation over the partisan disaster to complete his one hundred and thirty-chapter work. How could later scholars dare to face the wall in ignorance?

When the Ban family later continued the work, they fully adopted his text. Later, Du Yu’s *Comprehensive Institutions*, Zheng Qiao’s *Comprehensive Records*, and Ma Duanlin’s *Comprehensive Studies* were all commissioned by imperial decree to be preserved in the Three Archives, with scribes and writing materials provided by the Imperial Secretariat for transcription. Wang Anshi’s *Comprehensive Mirror*, Zhu Xi’s *Outline and Details*, and Hu Anguo’s *Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals* were all collaboratively edited by their disciples, sons, and even sons-in-law. Alas, how flourishing it was!

Now, some may have the ambition to strive but lack the strength to achieve; some may have the talent to exert themselves but find the records insufficient to support their efforts; some may be trustworthy themselves but find others’ preferences untrustworthy. In such cases, they can only harbor their aspirations. The noble person should not merely admire the talents of the ancients nor complacently accept the limitations of the present. Where effort is possible, one must strive; where preparation is possible, one must prepare; where trust is possible, one must be trustworthy. Only then may one approach the status of a school of thought, however modest.

Liu Xiang’s three sons—Ji, Ci, and Xin—all loved learning, but Xin was the most renowned. Father and sons were both devoted to antiquity. Appointed by imperial decree to oversee the collation of the secret archives, they lectured on the Six Arts, the *Records*, the various masters, poetry, rhapsodies, numerology, and esoteric techniques, exploring all without exception. After Liu Xiang’s death, Xin continued to oversee the Five Classics, completing his father’s work. They all began with the *Book of Changes*.

During the reign of Emperor Xuan, Xin was ordered to study the *Guliang Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals*. Upon encountering the ancient text of the *Zuo Tradition of the Spring and Autumn Annals*, he greatly admired it. Initially, the *Zuo Tradition* contained many archaic characters and expressions, and scholars merely explained its glosses. From then on, he began to cite the *Tradition* to elucidate the *Annals*, mutually clarifying their meanings, so that the chapters, sentences, and principles were fully expounded. Xin was deeply learned, with a broad vision and strong resolve, surpassing others. He once argued that Zuo Qiuming’s likes and dislikes aligned with the Sage and that he had personally seen Confucius, whereas the Gongyang and Guliang commentaries were transmitted by disciples among the Seventy, and thus the difference between hearsay and firsthand observation accounted for their varying levels of detail. He frequently posed difficult questions to Liu Xiang, who could not refute them.

**Record:** Ban Gu’s eulogy states: Confucius said, "It is difficult to speak with villagers." Since then, those who have continued the literary tradition include only Meng Ke, Sun Qing, Dong Zhongshu, Sima Qian, Liu Xiang, and Yang Xiong. These several masters were all broadly learned, widely informed, and well-versed in ancient and modern affairs. Their words were of benefit to the world.

The *Tradition* says: "If a sage does not appear in the world, there must be those destined for their era." Liu Xin’s *Discourse on the Great Plan* elucidated the *Great Transmission*, expounding the correspondence between Heaven and humanity. His *Seven Summaries* categorized the arts and literature, synthesizing the threads of the hundred schools. His *Investigation of the Three Sequences and the Star Calendar* calculated the movements of the sun, moon, and five planets, demonstrating his intent to trace their origins. Alas! Liu Xiang’s warnings about the dangers of imperial tombs are now all too evident.

The pointing to the pillars of catalpa and cedar makes the rise and fall clear—was this not the fruit of forthright integrity and the benefit of broad learning, to be observed and pondered? All that Liu Xiang had said in his memorials, both earlier and later, was marked by loyalty, earnestness, and sincerity; why did Heaven not protect him? Yet in the end, his words came to nothing—this was surely Heaven’s rejection, not something men could have prevented. His son Liu Xin changed his name to fulfill a prophecy and become a teacher, seeking favor in...—how shameful!

The *Later Han History* records Zheng Xuan’s admonition to his son Zheng Yien: “Our family was once poor and not tolerated by my parents or brothers. I left home to serve as a menial clerk, traveling to study in the capitals of Zhou and Qin, journeying through You, Bing, and the regions of Yan and Yu. There I met eminent scholars and great masters, receiving instruction from them. Thus I broadly studied the Six Arts, roughly perused the commentaries and records, and occasionally glimpsed the mysteries of the apocrypha and weft texts. Only after the age of forty did I return to care for my parents. For fourteen years, I was confined by the party proscription. Twice summoned by the imperial carriage, my name appeared alongside others’—I was nearly made a minister. Those several masters possessed noble virtue, worthy of serving as royal ministers, and thus were fittingly ranked in order. As for myself, I reflect and find no capacity for such a role. Yet I am mindful of expounding the original intent of the former sages and harmonizing the inconsistencies among the hundred schools—this is perhaps the utmost I can do with my abilities. But the Yellow Turbans brought chaos, and I drifted north and south before returning to my homeland. Now, at seventy, my strength and vitality have waned. According to the ritual canons, I should pass on my learning to my family. Now I tell you this in my old age: I will retire to cultivate my nature and devote myself to completing my work. Alas, you are but a solitary man, with no siblings to rely on. Strive most earnestly for the Dao of the noble person; study diligently without ceasing. Be reverent and cautious in your bearing, drawing near to those of virtue. Let your reputation shine among your peers, and establish virtue in your own resolve. If you achieve renown, it will bring honor to your parents—how could you not reflect deeply on this? If you neglect or forget this, then so be it.”

The record states: Observing Zheng Xuan’s writings during his lifetime, the difficulties he addressed amounted to over a million words. In his final years, he was deeply distressed that his beloved books had all decayed, and he could not transcribe and finalize them in the Hall of Ritual to pass on to others. He only sighed that the sun was setting in the west and, with this intent, admonished his son—he never sought recognition from others. Later, when Zheng Yien rushed to the aid of Beihai, he perished, and the family’s fortune dwindled, leaving nothing to rely on. Yet the commentaries he wrote on the Thirteen Classics and other treatises left no trace for later generations. As Confucius said, “If no one recognizes you, strive to be worthy of recognition.” Throughout his life, he had no desire for official robes and caps, and his noble act of declining a marquisate was not excessive. Compared to Ma Rong, who was ashamed of modest scholars yet indulged in luxury and self-gratification, and was ultimately ridiculed—he cannot be mentioned in the same breath.

Ban Biao was highly talented and fond of writing, devoting himself to historical works. After Sima Qian’s *Records of the Grand Historian* left off at the beginning of the *Taichu* era, the gap remained unfilled. Some enthusiasts had pieced together contemporary events, but their work was crude and vulgar, unworthy of continuing his book. Ban Biao thus gathered remnants of earlier histories and wove in diverse accounts, composing *Later Traditions* in dozens of chapters. He weighed and corrected the strengths and weaknesses of previous histories. After Ban Biao’s death, his son Ban Gu, finding his father’s continuation of the earlier history insufficiently detailed, secretly refined his thoughts, intending to complete the work. Later, someone accused Ban Gu of privately composing a national history. An edict was issued to the commandery to arrest him and seize all his family’s books. Ban Gu’s younger brother Ban Chao, fearing the commandery would torture him without cause, hurried to the capital to submit a memorial. He was granted an audience and fully explained Ban Gu’s intent in his writings. The commandery also submitted Ban Gu’s work, and Emperor Ming was greatly impressed. He summoned Ban Gu to the Imperial Library, where he served as a clerk alongside the former magistrate of Suiyang, Chen Zong; the magistrate of Ling, Yin Min; and the Attendant Officer of the Commandant of Justice, Meng Yi. Together, they completed the *Basic Annals of Emperor Guangwu*. Ban Gu was later promoted to Gentleman and tasked with collating the imperial archives. He composed twenty-eight chapters of biographies and memoirs, which he presented to the throne. The emperor then ordered him to complete the work his father had begun. Ban Gu believed that the Han had inherited the mandate of Yao to establish an imperial enterprise, reaching its sixth generation. Yet the historian had traced its merits and virtues, privately composing basic annals and placing them at the end of the hundred kings, alongside the ranks of Qin and Xiang Yu. Therefore, he explored earlier records, weaving together what he had heard to create the *History of the Han*, beginning with Emperor Gaozu and ending with Emperor Xiaoping—twelve generations spanning 230 years. He synthesized their deeds, interwove the Five Classics, and modeled it after the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, comprising annals, tables, treatises, and biographies in a total of one hundred chapters. From the *Yongping* era, when he received the imperial commission, he devoted over twenty years of thought to it, completing it during the *Jianchu* era. His work was highly esteemed by his contemporaries, and scholars all recited it.

The record states: Observing the works of Ban [Gu] and Sima [Qian], both had their precursors. Their painstaking refinement and deep thought are nothing extraordinary. Yet Emperor Ming’s severity was such that, instead of pardoning Ban Gu’s personal offense, he granted him the authority to compose history—this is unheard of throughout the ages. When Confucius wrote the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and Zuo Qiuming composed the *Discourses of the States*, they recorded events of their own time, which should have been avoided out of deference. Yet the eras they encountered were declining—if one were to be punished for such things, what would become of them? Thus, considering Hu Sui’s criticism of Sima Qian’s words, a noble person cannot but be cautious.

Ma Yuan’s nephews, Ma Yan and Ma Dun, both enjoyed mocking others and were reckless in their conduct. Ma Yuan wrote to admonish them: “When you hear of others’ faults, let it be as if you heard your parents’ names—your ears may hear, but your mouth must not speak. To delight in discussing others’ strengths and weaknesses, or recklessly judging the right and wrong of governance—this is what I most detest. I would rather die than hear of my descendants behaving this way. Long Bogao is honest, sincere, and cautious; his words are faultless. He is modest, frugal, incorruptible, and dignified. I love and esteem him—may you emulate him.”

Du Jiliang was a chivalrous man who loved righteousness, shared others’ sorrows, and rejoiced in their joys. When his father died, guests from several commanderies attended the funeral. I love and esteem him, yet I do not wish you to emulate him. If you fail to match Bogao’s conduct, you may still become a cautious and disciplined gentleman—like one who carves a magpie but falls short, yet still resembles a quail. But if you fail to match Jiliang, you will sink into the ranks of the world’s frivolous and dissolute—like one who paints a tiger but ends up with a dog. It is recorded: Though Yuan was so cautious and disciplined, he could not escape slander after his death—why? In his prime, he sought to settle in a frontier commandery to farm and herd, for he had not yet achieved his ambitions. Thus, his old resolve was that adversity would only make him firmer, and age would only make him stronger—who could take that from him? Yet when he committed himself to serving others, he became bound by his station. Though he longed to die in battle, wrapped in horsehide and content to close his eyes, how could all his wishes be fulfilled? Having once volunteered for service and shown himself ready in the saddle, slanderers seized the chance to malign him. This ruin he brought upon himself in seeking perfection resembles the case of the carved magpie—had it not been for Zhu Bo’s defense, would it not have been like painting a tiger and ending with a dog? This only confirms that even with caution and discipline, one may still fall short—how then can reckless chivalry be justified?

During Emperor Ling’s great purge of the partisans, an urgent edict ordered the arrest of Fan Pang and others. When the supervising officer Wu Dao arrived at the county, he clutched the edict, shut himself in the post station, and wept in the woods. Hearing of this, Pang said, “It must be for me.” He immediately turned himself in to the prison. The county magistrate Guo Ji was shocked, removed his official seal and sash, and urged Pang to flee with him, saying, “The Son of Heaven is vast—why should you remain here?” Pang replied, “If I die, the disaster will end. How dare I implicate you or leave my aged mother to wander?” His mother came to bid him farewell. Pang said to her, “My younger brother Zhongbo is not filial enough to support you. Now I follow Lord Longshu to the Yellow Springs, and each of us will be where we belong. I only ask that you, Mother, set aside your reluctance and not grieve too deeply.” His mother said, “Now you share the same fame as Li and Du—what regret could there be in death? You have already earned a fine reputation—can you also seek long life? Can both be attained?” Pang knelt to receive her teaching, bowed twice, and took his leave. Turning to his son, he said, “I would have you do evil, but evil must not be done. I would have you do good, but I have not done evil myself.” Those who heard this on the road could not help but weep.

It is recorded: People praise Fan Pang’s mother for her righteousness. I think her words were spoken out of necessity. Had she cherished his life, what good would it have done? Why not instead say: “Life’s length is determined by fate and duty. Even Yan Hui, who did good, fared no better than you. Fate comes from Heaven—do not blame yourself. Is this not understanding?” As for Li and Du, they lived through the same peril—why compare their deaths? Moreover, fame is but a single word, yet it sowed the seeds of disaster—such words should not have been spoken. What I privately rejoice in is that Zhongbo had a son, Longshu, a true man. The virtuous have descendants—this is not extinction. Otherwise, to suffer a premature death in the prime of life—would this not move all who walk the path to tears, and cause pain for ten thousand generations?

*The Book of Jin* records: Wang Bao’s father, Yi, served as Sima Zhao’s adjutant when the latter was General of Pacifying the East. After the defeat at Dongguan, Zhao asked the assembled officers, “Who bears the blame for today’s outcome?” Yi replied, “The responsibility lies with the commander-in-chief.” Zhao angrily said, “Does Sima intend to shift the blame onto me?” He had Yi dragged out and executed. Bao grieved deeply over his father’s unjust death. He withdrew to live in seclusion, teaching students, and declined three imperial summonses and seven offers of office. He built a hut beside his father’s grave, visiting it morning and evening to kneel and weep, clutching the trees in sorrow until his tears stained them and the trees withered. When reading the *Book of Songs* and coming to the line *“Alas for my father and mother, who toiled so hard to raise me,”* he would always reread it and weep. His disciples, studying under him, all abandoned the *“Liao and Biao”* chapters. Though poor, he tilled the land himself, farming only enough to feed his household and raising silkworms only enough to clothe them. When others secretly tried to aid him, Bao refused. After the Sima clan usurped the Wei throne, Bao never once sat facing west, to show he would not serve the Jin as a subject.

It is recorded: Wang Xiang was filial, yet when he became one of the Three Dukes, he treated his lord as a mere discarded hat or clod of earth, not even as steadfast as when he cut through ice to seek carp. Meng Zong was worthy, yet when he became a grandee, Sun Lin of Wu deposed Jing and had the matter announced at the ancestral temple before carrying it out—was this as compliant as when he wept over bamboo and moved Heaven? Then was Bao’s lifelong refusal to face west merely the result of reciting *“Alas for my father and mother”*?

The Inspector of Yanzhou, Wang Shu, was a cautious and honest man. He named his brother’s sons Mo and Chen, and his own sons Hun and Shen. In a letter, he admonished them: “I have given you these four names so that you will reflect on their meaning and never dare to transgress. Things that grow quickly perish quickly; those that mature late endure. Morning flowers wither by evening, but the pine and cypress remain lush even in the cold. Thus, the noble person is ever vigilant. To bend is to stretch, to yield is to gain, and to be weak is to be strong—few fail to succeed thus. Slander and praise are the roots of love and hate, and the pivot of fortune and misfortune. Confucius said, ‘Of the people I have met, who has slandered or praised me?’ Even a sage of such virtue was thus—how much more so for ordinary men? If someone slanders you, withdraw and examine yourself. If you have conduct worthy of slander, then their words are justified. If you have no such conduct, then their words are baseless. If justified, bear no grudge; if baseless, it does no harm. Why retaliate?”

The proverb says: "To ward off cold, nothing surpasses a thick fur; to silence slander, nothing surpasses self-cultivation." These words are truly trustworthy.

The record states: "Chang’s instruction to his son was as if preparing for a grand sacrifice." The four virtues—silence, profundity, depth, and simplicity—all embody the essence of modesty, humility, and refraining from self-boasting. Therefore, one should aspire to be like the sea, which receives a hundred rivers yet never appears full; or like a great cavern, which traverses ten thousand li yet never reaches its end. Only with such magnanimity and generosity can one attain the noble refinement of simplicity and the vast elegance of aid. If one applies this to the pursuit of merit and fame, one becomes a person of the Dao; if one expands it to embrace others with tolerance, one embodies the demeanor of a true elder. How could this not enhance one’s worthiness?

Yet if one borrows the ways of the vulgar, indulges in shame and resentment, one cannot escape the ridicule of contemporaries. And when reduced to a minor role in governance, crying out for recognition day after day, one instantly forfeits the very meaning of one’s name.

Alas!

*The Old Book of Tang* records: In the twenty-second year of the Zhenguan era, the Emperor composed twelve chapters of *The Emperor’s Model* and bestowed them upon the Crown Prince, saying: "The ruler’s conduct should be founded on reverence for kin, the seeking of worthies, the careful selection of officials, the acceptance of remonstrance, the rejection of slander, the avoidance of excess, the exaltation of frugality, the strictness of rewards and punishments, the prioritization of agriculture, and the honoring of both martial and literary arts." He further declared: "Self-cultivation and state governance are fully encompassed herein." If one adheres to even a single precept without deviation, what more need be said?

The Emperor further admonished: "You must seek out the ancient sagely rulers as your teachers, for I am not worthy of emulation. To take the highest as one’s model is merely to attain the middle; to take the middle as one’s model is to sink inevitably to the lowest. Since ascending the throne, my failings have been many. Brocade, pearls, and jade have never left my presence; palaces, halls, terraces, and pavilions have been repeatedly constructed; hounds, horses, hawks, and falcons have been procured from the farthest reaches. My travels in the four directions have imposed heavy burdens on the people. These are all grave errors of mine—do not regard them as right and follow them. Yet I have broadly succored the common people, and my benefits have been great; I have established order in the land, and my achievements have been vast. The gains outweigh the losses, so the people bear no resentment. The merits overshadow the faults, so the enterprise remains unblemished. Nevertheless, compared to perfect goodness, I am deeply ashamed. You have not my toil and merit, yet you inherit my wealth and nobility. Exert yourself in goodness, and the state may barely be preserved; indulge in arrogance, idleness, extravagance, and dissipation, and you will not even secure your own person. Moreover, a state is slow to be established but quick to fall; rank is easily lost but difficult to regain. How can you not cherish this? How can you not be cautious?"

The record states: Emperor Taizong’s instruction of the Crown Prince may be called consummate. Yet it is regrettable that in the Way of the ruler, he seems never to have heard of its true essence. The Way of the noble person begins with the relationship between husband and wife, and in its ultimate reach, it discerns the workings of Heaven and Earth. This is how the sages of high antiquity penetrated both high and low, proceeding from within to without, from the family to the court, and thus left no flaw. Now, observe how from "the ruler’s conduct founded on reverence for kin" to "the honoring of both martial and literary arts," all is set forth in full. Again, from the most trivial faults to the most manifest achievements, nothing is concealed—this may be called thoroughness itself. Yet never once does he touch upon the Way of governing the household. Could it be that the Emperor’s wisdom did not extend to this? The disaster at Wutai arose from turning the blade of *Chao Ci* back upon the nest; the words of family affairs hastened the plot to coerce the father. Not only was instruction incomplete, but even the prophecies and omens offered no remedy. Thus the noble persons of ancient Ye made it their sole duty to rectify the heart and sincerely embody virtue, to be cautious in solitude and vigilant in the slightest matters, never allowing a single thought to stray into carelessness. Only then did they proceed to ordering the state and pacifying the realm, maintaining a single thread throughout without omission. This was precisely what the Emperor alone neglected, and therein lay the deep calamity of the Tang.

Zheng Shan’guo’s father, Zheng Cheng, was a general of the Zhou dynasty who died in battle against Yuchi Jue. Shan’guo inherited his father’s title. When he later served as governor of Lu Commandery, his mother, Lady Cui, would sit behind a screen each time he held court, observing his judgments. If his rulings were just, she would return home overjoyed; if his conduct was unfair or he indulged in reckless anger, she would weep and refuse to eat. Shan’guo would prostrate himself before her bed and say: "Your late husband was upright and incorruptible in office, devoting himself to the state. You, from childhood, inherited his noble rank and now hold the position of regional governor—how can you recklessly indulge in anger, undermining public governance, disgracing the family’s legacy, and violating the Son of Heaven’s laws? With what face will you meet your late husband?" Thereafter, Shan’guo mastered his conduct and became renowned as an upright official.

Cui Xuanmei’s mother, Lady Lu, once admonished her son, saying: "I heard my cousin Xin Xuanyu say: ‘When a descendant holds office, if people say he is poor and unable to support himself, this is good news. If they say his wealth and possessions are abundant, this is bad news.’ I have always regarded this as a sound judgment. Recently, I have seen among our relatives those who amass wealth to provide for their parents, yet their parents do not inquire into its source. If it comes from their official salary, that is well. But if not, how is it different from theft? If you serve as an official and cannot be loyal and upright, you will have no ground to stand beneath Heaven and Earth. Take heed of my words." Thus, wherever Cui Xuanmei served, he became known for his integrity and purity.

The Record states: Zheng Shan’guo’s mother turned pale at the mention of tigers, for she bore wounds from them—thus her words were fierce. Cui Xuanmei’s mother, upon seeing worthies, sought to emulate them, for she had received their influence—thus her words were gentle. Both sons ultimately became known for their purity. Truly, the subtle teachings of the inner chambers are not in vain. Moreover, Xuanmei later corrected the course of the state, deposing the usurper and rendering great service to the Tang. Compared to Shan’guo, whose integrity faltered in his later years, he proved the superior.

Han Xiu had seven sons—Hao, Qia, Hong, Gong, Kuang, Hun, and Dong—all of whom were learned and prized fidelity and righteousness above all else in their time. When An Lushan rebelled, they were trapped and pressured by the rebels to accept office, but they refused and fled to the imperial court-in-exile, only to be captured. Hao, Hong, and Hun were all killed. Emperor Suzong, honoring the sons of a great minister who died for their loyalty, posthumously appointed Hao as Vice Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, Hong as Minister of Rites, and Hun as Vice Minister of Rites. Gong later became a Grand Master of Remonstrance, Qia ended his career as a Palace Censor, Dong as Grand Master of Sacrifices, and Kuang was promoted in the first year of the Zhenyuan era to Left Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs and concurrent Grand Chancellor. Kuang was frugal by nature, living in humble quarters that barely sheltered him from wind and rain. Though his residence qualified for the honor of displaying ceremonial halberds, he refused to request a grand hall, unwilling to alter the gate built in his father’s time. He had no mulberry or hemp fields; when his younger brother Dong made minor repairs, Kuang removed them, saying: "Our late father dwelt here. We serve him still, ever fearful of neglect. If the structure collapses, we shall repair it—but how dare we rebuild and mar the virtue of frugality?"

Though he held high office, he remained incorruptible, detesting evil, and never amassed wealth for his family. Early in his tenure as Director of the Bureau of Finance, Li Chen, a subordinate general, reported military matters to Kuang, treating him with great deference. He had his son bow to Kuang and presented lavish gifts of vessels, silk, and horses. Later, Chen rendered great service to the state. From his youth, Kuang bore a fine reputation, and in his later years, he further refined his family’s standards, rigorously instructing his descendants. Thus, during the Zhenyuan era, when people spoke of exemplary family traditions, they would say: "The Han and the Mu."

Mu Ning had four sons—Zan, Zhi, Yuan, and Shang—all renowned as Confucians, yet each took it upon himself to uphold integrity and moral resolve. Having passed the classics examination, Zhi was appointed magistrate of Guanshan. While passing through Pingyuan, he visited Yan Zhenqing. Upon hearing of An Lushan’s rebellion, he entrusted his sons to Zhenqing and instructed his mother and younger brother: "So long as my descendants are not wanting, that is enough." He then hastened to Zhenqing and said: "My father has heirs. Now I may follow you to death." Later, when Zhenqing crossed the river to meet Emperor Suzong, the emperor, struck by his resolve, appointed him Grand Master of Remonstrance. When Emperor Dezong fled to Fengtian, Ning rushed to the court-in-exile and was promoted to Vice Director of the Palace Library and Right Grand Master of the Crown Prince’s Household, serving until his old age.

Zan became Vice Censor-in-Chief, Zhi served as Right Rectifier of Omissions, Yuan as Supervising Censor, and Shang as Investigating Censor—all revered by the gentry for their adherence to the Dao and their conduct. Zan was the most filial and prudent; Zhi, resolute and upright; Yuan, skilled in literature; and Shang, devoted to fidelity and righteousness. Each earned a fine reputation, harmonious yet refined, likened in their time to rare delicacies. Zan, plain yet structured, was compared to cheese; Zhi, rich and substantial, to butter; Yuan, to fine wine; and Shang, to fermented bean curd. In their father Ning’s daily life, he often admonished his household, instructing his sons: "In serving one’s parents, the greatest duty is to nurture their will. My will is for the straight path alone. If I were to bend the Way, even offerings of three sacrificial animals and nine roasted meats would not be true nurturance."

The Record states: Xiu was a chief minister of his generation, and his family’s strict discipline had deep roots. Ning was merely a scholar—why should he be ranked alongside the Han? Yet fidelity and righteousness in Heaven and Earth are the same for the commoner as for the duke. Thus, only after the bleakness of winter’s desolation does the blossoming of spring unfold. Xiu pledged his state through righteousness; Ning pledged his life to his friend through death. Their towering integrity in matters of personal conduct could serve as the trunk of a tree or the face of a cliff. Others may blend as broth and season as salt and plum—no wonder they stand beyond doubt.

All regarded them as rare delicacies.

Yet was there not meaning in the sayings of that time?

**Virtue: The Bond of Father and Son**

From *The History of the Song*: The mother of the Great Ancestor, Empress Dowager Zhaoxian of the Du clan, governed her household with stern discipline and strict order. She bore five sons: the eldest, the Great Ancestor; then Kuangji, Guangyi, Guangmei, and Kuangzan.

When the Great Ancestor ascended the throne, he honored her as Empress Dowager. As he paid homage before her in the hall, all present offered congratulations, but she alone wore a solemn, joyless expression. Those around her said, “We have heard that a mother is ennobled through her son. Now that your son is the Son of Heaven, why do you not rejoice?”

The Empress Dowager replied, “I have heard that to be a ruler is difficult. The Son of Heaven stands above the myriad people. If he governs with the Dao, then this position is truly worthy of reverence. But if he loses control, even to be a commoner would be beyond reach. This is why I worry.”

The Great Ancestor bowed twice and said, “I humbly receive your instruction.”

The *Record* states: The Empress Dowager had witnessed the chaos of the Five Dynasties, where even families—mother and child—could not protect one another. Thus, she offered this admonition. Yet in *The Counsels of Great Yu*, the first principle is to “overcome difficulty.” The Empress Dowager not only understood the way of a mother but also the way of a ruler. By establishing this teaching, the Song dynasty avoided external disasters like those of the Lü, Wang, Wu, and Wei clans, and internally produced worthy ministers such as Gao, Cao, Xiang, and Meng. All this was inspired by the Empress Dowager’s exemplary conduct. How could the historians’ praise of Zhaoxian’s enduring influence be exaggerated?

When Emperor Taizong fell gravely ill, the Palace Attendant Wang Jienn, fearing the crown prince’s intelligence, secretly conspired with the Assistant Director of the Chancellery Li Changling, the Palace Commander Li Jixun, and the Academician Hu Dan to enthrone the former crown prince, Prince Chu, Yuanzuo. The Chancellor Lü Duan, visiting the emperor in the palace, noticed the crown prince was not in attendance. Suspecting treachery, he wrote the character “critical” (*dajian*) on a note and sent a trusted aide to summon the prince to the emperor’s side.

When the emperor passed, the Empress Dowager ordered Jienn to summon Lü Duan to discuss the succession. Duan, aware of the plot, deceived Jienn into entering the archives, then locked him inside and stationed guards. He hastened to the palace.

The Empress Dowager asked Duan, “The imperial carriage has already departed. To establish an heir, one follows seniority—what should be done?”

Duan replied, “The late emperor enthroned the crown prince precisely for this day. Now that he has left the world, how can we so quickly defy his decree and entertain other proposals?”

The Empress Dowager fell silent. They then escorted the crown prince to the Funing Palace, where he ascended the throne.

After the prince’s enthronement, the curtain was lowered for an audience with the ministers. Duan stood upright below the steps and did not bow. He requested that the curtain be raised so he could ascend the hall and verify the new emperor’s identity. Only then did he descend and lead the ministers in paying homage.

The *Record* states: After the betrayal of the Golden Casket’s covenant, the throne had barely passed to Zhenzong when the Wang Jienn plot arose—yet it was thwarted by Lü Duan. When it passed again to Renzong, the treachery of Yun Gong emerged—yet it was thwarted by Wang Zeng. Such crises mark the perilous turns of a state’s fate, while their resolution reflects the power of loyalty and magnanimity in governance. At that time, the virtue of the Song flourished, and the Dao of the noble prevailed. Thus, great ministers could act according to their principles, and villains found no opportunity to scheme. Had it been otherwise, would Jienn not have forced his way out rather than submit to imprisonment? As for Duan’s refusal to bow before the newly enthroned emperor, it was not by choice. Since he could not emulate the *Book of Zhou*’s *Testamentary Charge*, he had no choice but to verify the emperor’s identity by raising the curtain.

Initially, when Wang Anshi held power, he disrupted the established order. Empress Dowager Guangxian, during an audience, admonished Emperor Shenzong: “The laws of the ancestral founders should not be lightly altered. I hear the people are suffering greatly—abolish the Green Sprouts and Labor Service policies.”

When Emperor Shenzong passed and Emperor Zhezong ascended, Empress Dowager Xuanren of the Gao clan assumed regency. She dismissed the laborers constructing the capital, disbanded the palace guards, halted imperial workshops, abolished the Luoyang Canal Bureau, expelled thirteen particularly unruly attendants, and issued decrees to the court and the realm: no harsh exactions, ease the people’s burdens, protect households and horses, cease the manufacture of military equipment, halt the purchase of horses in Chengdu, close the commodity markets in the eastern and western capitals and Sizhou, abolish the Market Exchange, Pawnshop, Bian River Embankment, and Land Tax Bureaus, cancel the Equalization Tax, exempt arrears of the Labor Service fee, abolish fines for delayed appointments, cease the collection of circulation taxes, disband the Militia Tax, abolish the positions of Militia Tax Supervisors and Grain Tax Militia Officials, end the Square Fields system, dissolve the Yan-Yan military units, and halt the expansion of coin minting. Fourteen agencies acted on imperial orders without the knowledge of the Grand Councilor Wang Gui and his colleagues.

The *Record* states: In my view, the relationship between Empress Dowager Guangxian and Empress Dowager Xuanren exemplified the finest transmission of virtue between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Guangxian had intentions she did not act upon, which Xuanren fulfilled. Guangxian had established precedents worthy of emulation, which Xuanren followed. Had the emperors of Shaoxi and Chongning been like them, what harm would there have been in continuing the legacy? Alas, in name they upheld it, but in reality, they betrayed it. If they had any conscience, how could they face the two empresses in the underworld?

When Empress Dowager Xuanren passed, Emperor Zhezong changed the era name to Shaosheng. Yang Wei submitted a memorial: “Emperor Shenzong reformed the laws to benefit all generations. I beg you to swiftly deliberate and complete the path of *shaoshu* (continuing the legacy).”

The emperor inquired which former ministers should be recalled. Wei immediately submitted a memorial recommending Zhang Dun, Lü Huizhi, Deng Wenbo, and Li Qingchen. The emperor deeply approved and appointed Zhang Dun as Left Grand Councilor, making the continuation of Shenzong’s policies the state’s guiding principle. Dun then brought his allies—Cai Bian, Lin Xi, Huang Lü, Lai Zhishao, and Zhang Shangying—into key positions, entrusting them with remonstrance and policy-making. They colluded in cliques, schemed in factions, and settled personal vendettas.

The *Record* states: The calamities wrought by Wang Anshi’s faction were dire indeed. Critics merely blame the origins of the reforms, yet the true disaster lay in the policies of *shaoshu*.

The notion of *shaoshu*—continuing the legacy—is a noble governance. Did not Kings Wen and Wu, along with the Duke of Zhou, secure not only eight hundred years of fortune but also enduring renown across millennia? All say: “They were good at inheriting the aspirations of their predecessors and carrying forward their undertakings.” Yet to call it “good inheritance” and “good continuation” is but a single character’s distinction, pregnant with boundless depth that cannot be left unexamined.

The virtue of the benevolent ruler endures without end, while the *qi* of the perverse may not yet have dissipated. Had the benevolent emperor left an heir, and Shenzong’s line not been orphaned, the calamity of barbarian invasion might never have come to pass. Yet one reign of Empress Dowager Xuanren could not suffice to repair the damage, while a single act by Zhang Dun more than sufficed to ruin it—all because Zhezong was his son. A thousand words from Cui Ou and Chen Guan fell on deaf ears, while a single remark from Deng Xunwu pleased the emperor—because Huizong, too, was his son.

Alas! The Zhou dynasty passed the throne from Jili to King Chang, and Heaven’s mandate was firmly secured. Shenzong passed it from Zhezong to Huizong, and the state’s affairs daily worsened. Was this not because, though the act of inheriting aspirations and continuing undertakings was the same, the founding and transmission of the legacy were not equally virtuous?

Dou Yujun’s five sons—Yi, Yan, Kan, Cheng, and Xi—all passed the imperial examinations in succession, earning the name “Five Dragons.” Feng Dao composed a poem in their honor:

*“Dou Shilang of Yanshan,*
*Taught his sons with righteous methods.*
*An ancient cypress stands tall,*
*Five branches of red cassia bloom in fragrance.”*

By the first year of Jianlong in the Song dynasty, Emperor Taizu told his chief councilor: “For solemn and austere posts, one must appoint venerable scholars.” He praised Dou Yi as pure, upright, and steadfast—no one else would suffice. Immediately, Yi was appointed Academician, and later, the emperor repeatedly commended his integrity, intending to make him chief councilor. Zhao Pu, however, resented his unyielding正直. When Yi died, the emperor lamented, “Why did Heaven take Dou Yi from me so swiftly?”—grieving that his talents had not been fully employed.

Yan was especially brilliant, skilled in astrology and calendrical calculations. Serving alongside Lu Duoxun and Yang Huizhi as remonstrance officials, he once told them: “In the *dingmao* year, the five planets will gather in the *Kui* constellation, and from then on, the realm will know great peace.” And so it came to pass. Taizu later remarked to his courtiers: “Among recent officials, Dou Yan is grave, dignified, and disciplined, upholding his family’s traditions. His household is harmonious, and no slanderous words are spoken of him—none of his brothers can compare.” Xi, though of only average ability, was praised for his admirable conduct.

The *Record* states: Observing the Dou family in the early Song, their adaptability in serving the times may be criticized, but their righteous methods in teaching their sons are worthy of praise. Yet even with the five planets gathering in *Kui*, the talents of an era could only be aligned if the chaos of the Five Dynasties had not preceded it; without the upheaval of those turbulent years, the paths of the five brothers’ careers might never have converged.

Human nature and the ways of the world are generally thus—gentlemen ought not to censure them too harshly.

Chen Shenghua and his wife, née Feng, were stern and resolute in character, governing their household with discipline. Their sons—Yaosou, Yaozuo, and Yaozi—were always filial and respectful in daily life, their voices gentle as they stood by their parents’ side, never presuming upon their rank. During the Jingde era, Yaosou oversaw the central administration, Yaozuo served in the Historiographer’s Office, and Yaozi held the post of Academician Drafting Edicts, all three stationed in the Northern Bureau alongside their father. Whenever guests arrived, the brothers would stand in attendance beside their father, making the visitors so ill at ease that many would soon take their leave.

Yaosou was imposing in stature, vigorous in memorials and responses, keen in judgment, and rich in resourcefulness. Having long overseen confidential affairs, he could recall in full detail the registers of military horses. Yaozuo, the youngest, was fond of learning from childhood. When their father taught the classics to his sons, Yaosou had yet to complete his studies, but Yaozuo, listening in secret, had already memorized the texts. Even after rising to prominence, he never ceased reading. Early on, he followed Zhong Fang to Mount Zhongnan, where Chen Tuan said to Shenghua: “All three of your sons will become generals and ministers, but your middle son will be the most eminent and long-lived.” This proved entirely as Tuan had foretold. When Yaozuo later passed away, he composed his own epitaph, declaring: “Having lived eighty-two years, never having served as a first-rank official of the Celestial Ministry, nor as a mere ceremonial chancellor, nor having accepted a stipend that would bring disgrace—these three things may roughly suffice to return my spirit to the realm of my parents.” Yaozi, for his part, took moral integrity as his personal duty.

The gentleman remarks that Shenghua’s reputation grew all the more illustrious through his sons. Since the founding of the Song, no family’s moral legacy has surpassed theirs. The record states: Observing the Chen family, one sees that not only were they admirable in their time, but the middle son’s eminence and longevity were especially well attested. Yet while one may take pride in such self-fulfilling prophecies and use them to spur oneself onward, boasting and flattery are unbecoming. For nobility and long life are what all desire—yet there are those who cannot attain them, such as Yanzi, who died young; Zeng Shen, who received meager stipends; and Ran Min, who never rose in rank. Yet across ten thousand generations, none fail to revere them, for the sake of their virtue. Thus, the highest achievement is to establish virtue, the next to establish merit. Only by returning to rest in the realm where the spirit dwells can one hope to live up to the devotion of rising at dawn and retiring at dusk.

Lü Gongzhuo’s two sons, Xizhe and Xichun, in their youth studied moral character under Fu Shijie, grandson of the famed Qiao Gan, and Hu Huan. Their accomplishments far outstripped those of their peers. In adulthood, they further studied under the Cheng brothers and Zhang Zai, broadening their learning. They then renounced all ambition for advancement, refusing to pursue the imperial examinations, for they saw learning as a path to integrity, not to the fleeting gains of rank or stipend. When Wang Anshi sought to recommend his son Yu as a lecturer and, considering Xizhe’s reputation for virtue, wished to appoint him first, Xizhe declined, saying: “I have long been honored by your esteem. Yet if I were to enter office, I would inevitably disagree with you, and all our past affinity would be undone.” Anshi then abandoned the idea. Later, when Shen Gong became chancellor, his two younger brothers, Gongchuo and Gongbi, had already been appointed to positions in the ministries, while Xizhe alone remained relegated to managing the imperial storehouses. Shen Gong sighed, saying: “Of all the worthy men of this age, I have gathered nearly every one—yet because of me, he alone has not been given a proper appointment.” When his mother heard this, she laughed and said: “He does not yet know his own son.”

Rang Zuyu, his brother-in-law, spoke to Emperor Zhezong, saying: “Xizhe’s classical scholarship and moral conduct make him well-suited to serve as a lecturer.” Thereupon, he was appointed *Expositor-in-Waiting* of the Hall of Esteemed Governance. In his admonitions to the sovereign, he took self-cultivation as the foundation and the rectification of the mind and sincerity of intention as the essence, saying: “If one cannot cultivate oneself, how can one even instruct those at one’s side, let alone the realm under heaven?” Together with Xichun, he carried forward their family’s excellence. Affable, unassuming, frugal, and plain, he gained ever greater renown as the years passed, and both near and far regarded him with the reverence due a teacher.

The record states: The histories say that Lü Shen Gong, though he recognized his son’s worth, could not bring himself to recommend him, and thus fell short of his forebear. I, however, believe he did no dishonor to the *Minister of Righteousness*. Why? In the time of Wenmu, the Great Dao was openly practiced, and one ought not to have declined on grounds of distant scruples. By Shen Gong’s time, the Great Dao had already receded, and men had cause to fear being branded as partisans—this was his safeguard against later reproach.

Lin Xi once remarked: “Lü Dafang owed his advancement to Gongzhuo’s patronage, and thus promoted Xizhe to repay a private debt, while Gongzhuo’s misdeeds were abetted by Xizhe’s counsel.” Alas! Does not Mencius say: “Look up and feel no shame before Heaven; look down and feel no disgrace before men”? Compared to Yu and Xi and their ilk, Xizhe was not even worthy of a rotten rat.

Hong Hao’s three sons—Shi, Zun, and Mai—were all exceptional. Shi, the eldest, was quick-witted from childhood and could recite three thousand characters a day. When Hao was sent to the northern frontier, Shi, though only thirteen, took charge of the household. In recognition of his father’s service abroad, he was granted the honorary title *Gentleman for Fostering Excellence*. In the twelfth year of Shaoxing, he and his brother Zun both passed the *Erudite Literatus and Grand Composition* examination. Emperor Gaozong sighed, saying: “With their father far away, his sons have stood on their own—this is Heaven’s reward.” He therefore ordered their promotion.

The eldest, Shi, was appointed as an editor in the Imperial Decree Revision Office, while Zun became a Corrector of Texts in the Imperial Library. Three years later, Mai also passed the same examination. Thus, the literary fame of the three Hong brothers resounded throughout the realm. When Hong Hao returned, he clashed with Qin Hui, and all three sons were demoted to posts outside the capital. After Hao was exiled to Yingzhou, Shi spent nine years traveling back and forth across the Lingnan region to visit and attend to him. Upon Qin Hui’s death, Shi rose from the ranks of the Two Academies to the government in a single month. Four days later, he was elevated to the position of Grand Councilor. Zun was appointed Academician of the Hall for Aid in Governance, and Mai became Academician of the Hall of Enlightenment. Mai’s literary attainments were especially lofty, and his discussions in court were the most numerous—truly, the reward for loyalty and righteousness is not to be doubted.

The record states: How can Hong the Loyal and Upright be compared to Su Changru? In Wu’s time, the Central Kingdom was at its zenith, and the Xiongnu relied only on their arrogance. In Hao’s time, Hua and Yi were inverted, and death was as certain as life. Had it not been for Heaven’s reward, how could his family have prospered? Yet Qin Hui’s evil surpassed that of dogs and sheep, his poison more pervasive than the barbarians’ cruelty. The barbarians could tolerate him in foreign lands, but Qin Hui could not be endured in the same court. The emperor could promote him in a moment, yet could not protect him in the days to come. Though Heaven’s ways are inscrutable, in the end, Hao’s sons brought glory to their generation and adorned the state with their writings. Though they did not hold power in their father’s lifetime, they ascended to the grand councilorship after his death. Observing this, the court historians could only exclaim indignantly: “The reward for loyalty and righteousness has its reasons indeed!”

Hu Anguo had three sons: Yin, Hong, and Ning. Anguo was steadfast in learning and conduct, taking the sages as his model and dedicating himself to the welfare of the realm. Witnessing the Central Plains’ fall and the people’s suffering, he felt as though the pain were his own. Though repeatedly dismissed from office, his love for his sovereign and concern for the state only deepened with time. Whenever imperial commands arrived, he set aside all family matters. Yet his demeanor was serene and detached, transcending worldly dust; he regarded all things under heaven as unworthy of ensnaring his heart. After the *Spring and Autumn Annals* was abolished from the official curriculum during the Zhenghe and Xuanhe eras, Anguo lamented: “This book, personally edited by the former sage, is now kept from the ruler’s ears and scholars’ transmission. The collapse of ethics and the inversion of principle, the transformation of Xia into Yi—all stem from this.” He devoted over twenty years to this text, believing it encompassed all matters under heaven. He often sighed: “This tradition is the essential canon of the heart.”

Yin, styled Zhitang, was treated by his father as a nephew or younger brother. In his youth, he was unruly and difficult to control, so his father confined him to an empty attic. The attic had miscellaneous wood, which Yin carved entirely into human figures. Anguo said: “There must be a way to redirect his heart.” He placed several thousand volumes of books in the attic. After a year, Yin had memorized them all without omission. His resolve and spirit were bold and unrestrained; when the order for his exile to Xinzhou arrived, he set out that very day.

Hong, styled Wufeng, inherited his father’s learning. He wandered leisurely at the foot of Mount Heng for over twenty years, refining his spirit and insight day and night without cease. Zhang Shi became his disciple. When Anguo transmitted the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Ning was responsible for collation and compilation, producing the *Comprehensive Essentials of the Spring and Autumn Annals* to supplement the text.

The record states: People likened Kanghou to the harsh frost of deep winter—how could his sons wither in the cold of the year? Their memorials to the throne were as solemn as if cast from the same mold. This was due to their family learning, which took the *Spring and Autumn Annals* as its standard. The father oversaw compilation, and the son assisted in collation—within their household, it was as though a bureau of historians had taken shape. Such figures as Master Wen and Kanghou are rarely seen. Though they did not serve in office, it was as though they had. That father and sons together stood as pillars of Confucianism—was this not splendid?

Cai Yuanding had two sons, Yuan and Shen, both of whom tilled the land and refused office. When Yuanding was exiled to Daozhou, they trekked thousands of miles. Passing through the remote regions of Chu and Yue, father and sons faced each other, finding joy only in the Dao. At thirty, Shen abandoned the pursuit of examination degrees and took the sages as his teachers. Regarding the numbers of the *Great Plan*, scholars had long lost their transmission, but Yuanding alone grasped them, though he had not yet written them down. He often said: “Shen will complete my book.” Shen received his father’s teachings and immersed himself in them for decades, revisiting and refining them before finally completing the work. He held that the *Changes* embodied the images of heaven and earth’s composition, while the *Great Plan* recorded its numbers. Numbers begin with the odd one, and images are formed by the even two. The odd enables numbers to unfold, while the even establishes images. Thus, two becomes four, and four becomes eight—eight being the images of the eight trigrams. One becomes three, and three becomes nine—nine being the numbers of the nine categories. From this, they are doubled to sixty-four, and sixty-four to four thousand ninety-six, at which point the images are complete. Nine becomes eighty-one, and eighty-one becomes six thousand five hundred sixty-one, at which point the numbers are exhaustive.

The *Changes* passed through four sages before its images were set down, while the *Great Plan* bestowed upon the divine Yu did not transmit its numbers. Later scholars, ignorant of the origins of images and numbers and the subtleties of transformation and adaptation, either derived numbers from images or forced images from numbers. Some relied on the *Cave of Profundity* for their texts, others on the *Mysterious Void* for their diagrams, piecing together forced interpretations—thus, the natural numbers were obscured.

Yuanding’s father said: “The *Luo River Writing* is the origin of numbers.” I read the *Great Plan* and was moved. By examining the heavens above, the earth below, and humanity in between, the changes of past and present, the profound subtleties of principle, and the signs of rise and fall, the proper order of human relations is established, and all things under heaven find their rightful place. Thus, Jia of Xishan regarded it as equal in achievement to the *Changes* of the Three Sages.

The record states: Of the sons of these several gentlemen, only Jiufeng’s transmission truly grasped its essence. His work, *The Supreme Principle of the Great Plan*, reveals that the brush of heaven and earth is number, the generation of humanity is number, and the gains and losses of the myriad things are also number.

Number manifests its substance in form, and its function is wondrous in principle. Only those who have exhausted the spiritual and understood transformation, standing alone beyond the realm of things, are fit to partake in this. In compiling his *Collected Commentaries*, he declared: “The governance of the Two Emperors and Three Kings was rooted in the Dao; the Dao of the Two Emperors and Three Kings was rooted in the heart. Ritual, music, education, and transformation are the heart’s emanations; canonical institutions and cultural artifacts are the heart’s manifestations; the ordering of the household, the governance of the state, and the pacification of all under heaven are the heart’s extensions. How abundant is the heart’s virtue! The heart of the sage, revealed in texts, is like the marvelous workings of the Creator manifested in things—only the profoundly discerning can recognize it. This is why he stands preeminent among his peers and is rightfully enshrined in the temple of the Master—is this not fitting?”

Li Shunchen had three sons: Xinzhuan, Daozhuan, and Xingzhuan. Shunchen transmitted learning through practice and left many writings. Father and sons alike possessed historical talent; he was promoted to Recorder of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices and oversaw the revision of the jade tablets for Emperor Yuling’s mausoleum. When Zeng Bu and Lü Huiqing first rose to power, he meticulously recorded their actions. Some argued that appointments and dismissals not made by the chief minister should not be recorded. Shunchen replied: “Matters of governance and neglect cannot be bound by conventional rules.” Many of his editorial revisions followed this principle.

Xinzhuan, as Compiler, was solely responsible for compiling the veritable records of the Gaozong, Xiaozong, Guangzong, and Ningzong reigns. In the third year of the Duanning era, he submitted a memorial on the causes of drought, stating: “The increase of harmonious radiance has multiplied the people’s resentment.” And: “The confiscation of property without just cause has provoked the people’s resentment.” All these arose in the aftermath of great warfare, and with no means to resolve them, they accumulated to an extreme.

Daozhuan was well-versed in the studies of the Yellow River and Luo River. He once sought out those who had studied under Zhu Xi, engaging in discussion and obtaining all of Zhu’s posthumous writings to read. He was steadfast in practice, and on his bed, he had the large characters “Awaken, Interrupt, Sever, Decide” posted—such was his dedication to vigilance in solitude. Though he left no commentaries on the classics or histories, he said: “My learning is not yet sufficient; I dare not write poetry.” Nor did he compose casually, saying: “My learning is not yet sufficient; I have no leisure.”

Xingzhuan, during an imperial audience, spoke of “revering Daoist learning but failing to attain its substance.” The Emperor asked: “What is its substance?” He replied: “It lies in the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge, which is the foundation of governance.” He also remarked: “After the Zhou dynasty’s decline, feudal lords and high ministers all removed mourning garments after burial. By the Qin and Han eras, mourning periods were particularly brief. Emperor Xiaowen established a thirty-six-day period, which was already an improvement over the time before Emperor Hui. After the Eastern Han, it was further reduced to twenty-seven days, called ‘exchanging months for days’—the ultimate in meagerness.”

The record states: I observe that within the Li family, the three sons’ attainments were roughly the same, and their inclusion in the *History of the Song* under the “Confucian Scholars” section is no disgrace. Yet they were divided into four separate entries. Even if Xinzhuan and Daozhuan were grouped together in one lane, they were still separated into two gates. Such instances reveal the chaos of “ten shepherds for nine sheep,” with no coherence between past and present, making it impossible to avoid redundancy. Yuan Ding’s son Shen was enshrined in the temple, yet no biography was written for him, while his son Kang was given one—this was merely for official rank. Thus I say: “Is it that I delight in argument? I cannot do otherwise.”

Tang Lin, upon being appointed Investigating Censor of the Censorate, was so alarmed that he fled in panic. His mother said: “People say this is a fine office; why are you worried?” Lin replied: “This office requires one to contend over right and wrong for the court. If I oppose the emperor’s will or offend the powerful, I fear it will bring great trouble to you.” His mother said: “Just speak your mind fully. I have your elder brother.” Lin bowed in gratitude and assumed his post. His first memorial stated: “Heaven’s changes have reached the point of wrath; the people’s resentment has nearly led to separation. The realm is on the verge of collapse, and the state is about to fall. What time is this, that Your Majesty still indulges desires, accumulates faults, covers up errors, distances the upright, and clings to favored relatives and eunuchs? The chief minister employs literary talent as tools for governance, disregarding the people’s lives, recklessly provoking unrest, failing to assess circumstances, and depleting the national treasury. The imperial son governs frivolously, colludes with merchants, opens wide the path of bribery, abandons the *Xiaoya*, and allows petty in-laws to meddle in treacherous schemes, treating state affairs like a play and the sacred vessel as merchandise. The capital’s people are aghast; the court officials are pained. Why not enforce the punishment for ‘not yet traitorous’ to manifest the crime of disloyalty?”—this was directed at Jia Sidao.

In his second memorial, he stated: “Zheng Qingzhi’s incompetence and misguidance harmed the state; his son Shichang abused power and accepted bribes, promoted mediocre generals to command and corrupt officials to govern.” Lin had been in office for only a hundred days, yet the world said, “Tang Zifang has reappeared,” all due to his mother’s guidance.

According to the *History of the Yuan*: When Yao Tianfu was appointed Investigating Censor, his mother admonished him: “The ancients spoke of ‘public-mindedness, forgetting the private.’ Having pledged yourself as a minister, you must exhaust your sincerity to fulfill your duty; do not let concern for me, a widow, hold you back. If you enable me to follow in the footsteps of the mother of Ling, then in death I will be as in life.” Tianfu also petitioned the Censorate: “The duty of a censor is to speak out; one must not conceal anything, even at the risk of punishment. If I am reprimanded, I beg that my family not be implicated.” When this was reported, Emperor Shizu sighed: “Though Tianfu and his mother live in this age, their words of righteousness and integrity must be sought among the ancients.”

The record states: The maternal teachings received by Tang Lin of the Song and Tianfu of the Yuan were the same, yet their achievements differed. Lin stood in office for barely a hundred days, and though his words were incisive and unflinching, the Song was by then beyond saving. Even if Zifang had returned, who could have rescued it? Tianfu, however, served during the reign of Shizu, when his conduct was practiced and his words heeded. Not only did he rectify the Censorate’s discipline, eliminating the peril of “one snake with two heads,” but he also reestablished the surveillance system, achieving the merit of subduing powerful local families.

Yet Lin was no coward—his was the sorrow of one unable to bear the weight of a collapsing edifice; Tianfu was no hero—his was the fortune of serving when the Yuan’s destiny still rose, spared the grief of self-inflicted calamity. The mother’s joy and fear mirrored the age’s decline and ascent, as clearly as could be seen.

Baizhu was the grandson of Antong. Orphaned at five, he was raised with stern virtue by his mother, Lady Quolie. As he grew, his bearing became grand, upright, and luminous, inheriting his grandfather’s legacy. Once, he memorialized: “In office, one’s duties may be mastered through practice, but learning must be rooted in fundamentals to be applied to governance. This is the scholar’s path, the foundation of a prime minister.” When the Emperor entrusted him with great responsibility, he declared three fears: dishonoring his ancestors, failing to grasp the vastness of the realm’s affairs, and being too young to bear the burden and repay the sovereign’s grace. He served in the inner court with unflinching candor, speaking without reservation.

Upon becoming chief minister, he restored discipline, revived neglected institutions, curtailed nonessential tasks, closed the gates to favor-seekers, bestowed kindness upon soldiers and commoners, and lightened taxes. Emperor Yingzong relied on him, and together they strove to govern with vigor. The realm was at peace, the nation prosperous, the people content. Even distant barbarians, unknown in ancient times, came to pay tribute and request officials.

When he first served as Director of the Ritual Institute at just twenty, clerks came to his residence to seek his seal. Finding him in the rear garden at play, his mother rebuked him sharply: “If official matters go unaddressed, is this the conduct of a man of stature?” He immediately examined himself and repented. One day, attending a banquet, Yingzong pressed him to drink several cups. Upon returning home, his mother admonished him: “When the Son of Heaven compels you to drink, you must be all the more vigilant—do not indulge in wine.” She oversaw every aspect of his conduct. Thus, it was said that Baizhu’s virtue was the fruit of his mother’s teachings.

The *Record* states: Muhuali was one of the Four Heroes of the Yuan. Four generations later came Antong, and two generations after him, Baizhu. That they were men of reverence—three generations of grandfather, father, and grandson unashamed of their legacy—who would have thought such virtue could arise from a barbarian dynasty? Tracing its source, we find it was their mothers who, as the guiding reins, reined in their wayward hearts, lest they sink into dissipation. Thereafter, none could match them.

*The Record of Illustrious Ministers of the August Ming*: During the Jingtai reign, Minister of Rites Zhang Lun, Supervising Secretary Lin Cong, Censor Zhong Tong, and Chief Justice of the Court of Judicial Review Liao Zhuang memorialized on the occasion of calamitous omens. At that time, the Supreme Emperor resided apart in the Southern Palace, and the Xian Emperor had altered the heir apparent to a prince. The two palaces were estranged, suspicion and discord sprouting, calamities and omens recurring, and the people’s hearts trembled with fear. Yet no court minister dared speak. Zhang Lun alone presented fourteen measures to cultivate virtue and avert disaster, emphasizing filial piety: “The Supreme Emperor ruled all under Heaven for fourteen years. Your Majesty once personally received his investiture and revered him as a subject—he is the father of all under Heaven. On the first and fifteenth of each month, as well as the New Year’s Day, you should lead the assembled ministers to pay court, thereby fulfilling the utmost way of reverence. You should also restore the former empress to the central palace to rectify the motherly model for all under Heaven, and restore the former heir apparent to the Eastern Palace to secure the great foundation of all under Heaven. In this way, human relationships will be deepened, harmonious qi will fill the realm, Heaven’s will shall turn, and calamities shall cease.” His words offended the throne and led to his imprisonment.

Earlier, in the third year of Jingtai, when the court first proposed altering the heir apparent, the matter was put to deliberation among the ministers. The entire court, high and low, hesitated, none daring to speak—except Lin Cong, who first declared: “The heir apparent has committed no fault; he cannot be replaced.” Indignant, he refused to sign his name. His stance aligned with the remonstrances of Zhong Tong and Liao Zhuang before and after. Though they could not prevent the change, the people admired the righteousness of these ministers, and in the end, Heaven’s mandate remained unaltered.

The *Record* states: Observing the righteousness of these ministers, one is struck by its solemnity—it embodies the great principle of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, upon which the present age and all generations to come depend. When Duke Zhuang of Qi fled in exile, he was never deposed; when Duke Yin of Lu acted as regent, Duke Huan succeeded him. When the Ying Emperor first returned, the Xian Emperor was at the height of his power—why then was the succession altered? Moreover, the Jing Emperor’s heir was ailing, and later, calamities recurred. At that time, it would have been fitting to heed the counsel of Zhong Tong and Zhang Lun, and the arguments of Lin Cong and Liao Zhuang: to honor the Supreme Emperor with due rites and restore the heir to the Eastern Palace. Thus, names would have been rectified, words justified, and the “Seizure of the Gate” incident might never have occurred. In but a moment, Heaven would have assented, the people followed. The Ying Emperor, though eclipsed, would have regained his radiance; the Xian Emperor, though deposed, would have been restored. The succession would have passed to Our August Emperor, extending for myriad years, boundless blessings. Were not the proposals of these ministers clear and upright? From this, we know that the great succession of Our Ming, established between Heaven and Earth, shining like the sun and moon, cannot be violated even for a moment.

*The Yan Dui Record*: In the fifth month of the eighteenth year of Hongzhi, the emperor fell ill. The Directorate of Ceremonial summoned Grand Secretaries Li Dongyang, Liu Jian, and Xie Qian to the Palace of Heavenly Purity. Approaching the imperial couch, they found the emperor seated in informal attire. Liu Jian and the others kowtowed. The emperor bade them draw near, and they knelt directly before the couch. The emperor said: “I have inherited the great succession of my ancestors and reigned for eighteen years. Now, at thirty-six, I have fallen gravely ill—it seems I shall not rise again.” His jade-like complexion flushed red, his voice fiery, his breath forceful. Liu Jian and the others said: “May Your Majesty live ten thousand years! This is but a passing indisposition; with brief recuperation, how could you speak thus?” The emperor replied: “I know my own condition. There is also the mandate of Heaven, which cannot be forced. I have upheld the laws and institutions of my ancestors and dared not indulge in idleness or excess.”

Having received the profound grace of my late imperial father, Zhang was chosen as empress. The marriage was solemnized in the twenty-third year of Chenghua, and on the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month in the fourth year of Hongzhi, the Eastern Palace heir was born. Now fifteen years of age, he has yet to be betrothed. The affairs of the altars of soil and grain weigh heavily—let the Ministry of Rites promptly arrange the proceedings.

All responded: “As you command.”

The emperor continued: “The heir is intelligent, yet young and fond of ease and pleasure. Masters, you must frequently summon him to study and guide him to become a worthy man.”

Liu Jian and the others kowtowed and, looking up, replied: “How dare we not exert our utmost?”

Lu wrote: Observing the dying commands of the Filial Emperor, one sees their unhurried thoroughness, their beginning and end in meticulous detail—comparable to the *Gu Ming* of the *Book of Zhou*, though separated by ages, they share the same principle. When he said, “I have upheld the laws of my ancestors and dared not indulge in idleness or excess,” this is a thought for ministers and sons of all generations to ponder deeply and painfully, a sentiment that lingers unforgotten in the hearts of men. Yet the warning against fondness for ease, as if foretold in his final injunctions, was soon overshadowed by the clamor of Liu Jin, Zhu Ning, Jiang Bin, and their ilk, whose blind delusions repeatedly stirred and extinguished the spirit of Heaven. That their mischief did not endure long—was this not the fruit of far-sighted counsel?

The祭酒 Song Gun, by nature pure and sincere, conducted himself with restraint, never speaking or laughing idly. When the Imperial University was established, tribute students from within and beyond the realm gathered, and the number of scholars grew daily. As teaching and discipline faltered, he was promoted to *jijiu*, and with tireless effort, he tightened regulations, expounded the classics, and struck the drum to clear the halls, so that students, like guests returning home, flocked to him. He customarily slept and took his meals in the side chambers, never lodging at home. One day, taken ill, the emperor dispatched an emissary to inquire and summoned his son Lin back to the capital to attend him. When Lin and others later pleaded to return home, Song rebuked them sternly: “What lack of resolve is this? So little of the spirit of wind and clouds, and so much of the sentiment of sons and daughters!” Only when his illness grew critical did he return. The emperor personally composed an elegy to be recited at his official mourning rites, and his second son, Fuzu, succeeded him as *siye*.

The record states: Day after day he toiled, ceasing only in death. This is how the sage exhorts scholars—yet never had it been heard that one should not lodge at home. To say one has too little of the spirit of wind and clouds and too much of the sentiment of sons and daughters—does this then require a heart of iron and stone? Nevertheless, for such a man to hold the position of tutor and guardian, to never rest from the ruler’s daily inquiries, to spend little time in the company of worthy scholar-officials and much with eunuchs and palace women—this is how the Dao gains the sovereign’s trust, and loyalty is embodied in action. His son Fu later became *siye*; how could he be compared to ordinary brothers and sons?

From *Yin Zhi’s Miscellaneous Records*:
Minister He, posthumously honored as Wensu, whose father was Grand Guardian and Minister of Personnel He Wenyuan: When the latter served as Prefect of Wenzhou, he refused a gift of gold, and the people built the "Hall of Refused Gold" in his honor, which still stands today. When Minister He first passed the imperial examinations and was sent to Huaixi, Magistrate Chao of Huizhou, who had once been his father’s student, presented him with silver. Minister He declined, but Chao said, "I do this to honor my teacher, not to give to you." He replied, "If you wish to honor my father, it may be done through another, but not through me." While serving in Fujian, a eunuch in charge of maritime trade died, and the regional commander divided his remaining wealth, sending a portion to the Three Departments. Minister He alone refused it; when he could not avoid accepting it, he took it and turned it over to the public treasury. Later, as Surveillance Commissioner of Bian, General Wu Chengde once recommended a ruined man and presented him with a rhinoceros-horn belt and silver vessels. Minister He smiled and said, "I know you, but you do not know me." Wu withdrew in shame. When Minister He retired, Commissioner Yang sent an envoy with gold and silk to offer birthday felicitations, along with fine timber suitable for funerary furnishings—none of which he accepted. Someone advised him, "The caution against greed applies especially today." But his incorruptibility was simply his nature.

The record states: There is an old saying, "A minister’s integrity does not surpass his father’s." Now there is also the saying, "He’s integrity does not surpass his son’s." In my humble opinion, while the purity of scholar-officials is a noble virtue, and even if it is passed down through generations by effort and example, one should still look up to such men—yet to regard it as excessive is misguided. If one’s emotions are too rigid or extreme, then the world would have no complete men. Thus, it is recorded.

In the early years of the Tianshun reign, the eunuch Cao Jixiang and the Duke of Zhongguo, Shi Heng, exploited their favor to wield unchecked power. The supervising censor Yang Yi impeached them. Soon after, comets and celestial omens repeatedly appeared, and the two factions grew even more emboldened. The official rallied thirteen circuits to jointly submit a memorial, vehemently denouncing those who privately curried favor with Heng. Thereupon, Heng conspired with Jixiang, submitting a forged document to imprison him in the Embroidered Uniform Guard’s dungeon, where he was put to death. Just then, a great storm of wind, rain, and hail struck the capital, uprooting trees and destroying houses, and even hurling the imperial horse tally beyond the Zhengyang Gate. Only then was his sentence slightly reduced, and he was exiled to the eastern frontier of Liaodong. Upon receiving an amnesty, he was restored to office. However, as the two villains still held power, some advised him to offer an apology to avoid further trouble. He refused, and was once more exiled, this time to Guangxi. Only after the two villains were executed was he fully reinstated.

His son, Yuan, served during the Hongzhi reign as an assistant observer in the Directorate of Astronomy. In the early Zhengde era, when the traitor Liu Jin held power, Yuan submitted a memorial stating: "The astrological observations reveal that the Great Horn and the central stars of the Heart Mansion are trembling, while the Celestial Pivot and Celestial Authority stars grow dim." He thus urged the late emperor to remain secluded in the deep palace, refrain from excursions, curtail rewards and construction projects, consult with elder ministers, and study the classics. In another memorial, he wrote: "On the twenty-sixth day of the tenth month, the astrological observations show that for days on end, dense mists have gathered, signifying the yin-qi of manifold evils overwhelming the yang-qi of the minister and deceiving the ruler. Petty men usurp power, subordinates rebel against superiors—this analogy is most apt." He further stated: "Since the second year of the Zhengde reign, the astrological observations have consistently shown Mars entering the Supreme Palace Enclosure, before the Emperor’s Throne, now east, now west, moving unpredictably." He urged the emperor to take precautionary measures. His intent was clearly directed at Liu Jin.

Liu Jin, enraged, summoned Yuan for a face-to-face reprimand, falsely accused him, had him caned, and exiled him to Suzhou. The record states: To observe the decree of exile—once is already excessive, yet I have never heard of one who, exiled a second time, felt no remorse. Words left unspoken—when the father has already suffered punishment, I have never heard of a son who would tread the same path. Only with a father and son of iron resolve does one find such repeated divinations and auguries. The Yang family may be said to have not perished. In this great storm of hail, one may also perceive the utmost benevolence and love of Heaven.

**On the Righteousness of Husband and Wife**

Wan Zhang asked: The *Book of Songs* says, *"How does one take a wife? One must inform one’s parents."* If we trust these words, no one should exemplify them more than Shun. Yet Shun married without informing his parents—why?

Mencius replied: Had he informed them, he would not have been able to marry. The union of man and woman is one of humanity’s great bonds. To inform them would have disrupted this great bond, thereby incurring the resentment of his parents—thus, he did not inform them.

Wan Zhang said: Shun’s marriage without informing his parents—I have now heard your explanation. But when the Emperor gave Shun his daughters in marriage, why did he also not inform Shun’s parents?

Mencius replied: The Emperor, too, knew that had he informed them, he would not have been able to arrange the marriage.

The record states: When Duke Zhuang of Lu ascended the throne in his twenty-second year, he was already thirty-six when he first betrothed a wife from Qi—was this not because had he informed his parents, he would not have been allowed to marry? Had a sagely king been on the throne, punishing Wen Jiang for her lack of maternal kindness and correcting Duke Zhuang for his filial impiety, then he would have been spared the humiliation at Ren Tower and Luo’s coercion, nor would he have ended as weak as King Xiang of Yin or as young as Duke Min, and the treachery of Ziya and Qingfu might never have arisen. Yet how was it that, just as Duke Huan was rectifying the state and the blood oath had yet to be inscribed, he failed to consider the great concern of leaving no heir, instead fretting over the question of avoiding calamity? Compared to one who marries without informing his parents, how much worse was his conduct? Only by considering both cases together can one understand why the two sages’ marriages without informing parents were righteous, and why Mencius’ exercise of expediency was so profound.

The *Book of Rites* states: The rites of marriage mark the beginning of ten thousand generations. To marry from a different clan is to draw close to distant kin while reinforcing distinctions. The betrothal gifts must be sincere in word, and nothing should be withheld in informing the parents with honesty and trust. Trust is the foundation of serving others, and trust is the virtue of a wife. Once united as one, it endures for a lifetime without change—thus, when the husband dies, she does not remarry.

The record states: That this is placed after the *Book of Rites* is the expediency of a great sage. The great rites are the constant principle. To correct the constant principle before it aligns with ritual is like one who can establish the norm yet speak of expediency. Thus, there were those who married within their own clan and called it "Wu Mencius," those who defied honesty and trust and wept as the woman of Wu was sent away, those who neglected the proper words and gifts and quarreled like rats and dogs, and those who betrayed their vow to grow old together and were not even as steadfast as quails and magpies—all were criminals for ten thousand generations.

The *Book of Songs* says: The queen, thinking of her lord who is not by her side, says:
*"Gathering the curling dock, I cannot fill my shallow basket.
Alas, I think of my beloved, truly upon the Zhou road.
I climb that high mound, my horses weary.
I pour from that golden goblet, hoping to ease my longing.
I climb that high ridge, my horses faltering.
I pour from that rhinoceros-horn cup, hoping to ease my sorrow.
I climb that rocky slope, my horses stumble.
My attendants are exhausted—oh, how can I sigh thus?"*

The record states: Some say this poem was composed during King Wen’s imprisonment at Youli—does this not show understanding? Though King Zhou’s governance was indeed cruel, the heart of a minister who deserved execution was not something King Wen sought to change. The queen’s inner anxiety and fear, her outward devotion and service—did she not truly walk the Zhou road? Her allusion to wine was not truly to dispel sorrow. Was it not that Chong Hou’s slander was at its peak, while Lü Ya’s schemes had yet to unfold? In the end, with no recourse, she could only sigh in despair—yet can the queen not be called a paragon of utmost virtue?

The southern states, transformed by King Wen’s virtue, saw the feudal lords and ministers serving on distant missions, while their wives remained at home. Moved by the changing seasons, they longed for their lords, saying:
*"The katydids chirp, the crickets leap.
I have not seen my lord—my heart is heavy with sorrow.
But when I see him at last, when I behold him at last, my heart is at peace.
I climb that southern mountain, gathering bracken.
I have not seen my lord—my heart is filled with grief.
But when I see him at last, when I behold him at last, my heart is glad.
I climb that southern hill, gathering ferns.
I have not seen my lord—my heart is filled with sorrow.
But when I see him at last, when I behold him at last, my heart is at ease."*

The record states: The commentary treats this poem as akin to the *Zhou Nan*’s *"Curling Dock"*—for when Zhou was above and the Lord of the West below, though the feudal lords harbored private admiration for his virtue, they were in truth serving the public duty. Their sorrow could not be suppressed. How much more so when the marshes of Youli were filled with mutilated men, as if they could not prevail? Yet once they saw their lords and rejoiced, the emotions of public and private, the distinctions of high and low, were both fulfilled. This is the transformation of *Shao Nan*. If one were to see only the affection of clasped hands and the longing of separation, how trivial would be the matters of sorrow and joy!

In Wei, a woman, thinking of her lord serving on a distant mission, said:
*"The pheasant flies, its feathers flowing.
I think of my beloved—how distant and perilous the road!
The pheasant flies, its cry rising and falling.
Ah, my lord—truly, you weary my heart.
Gazing at the sun and moon, my thoughts stretch endlessly.
The road is so long—when will you return?
All you noble lords, do you not know virtue?
Neither arrogant nor covetous—why then are your ways not good?"*

The record states: The meaning of this poem is such that even among Confucius’ disciples, few below Zilu could comprehend it.

When you and I stand face to face, only then does the heart of magnanimity arise; when presence and absence are distinguished, only then does the heart of longing arise. Yet at its utmost, a son’s devotion to his parents may lead to execution for a wife’s offense—no punishment could be more severe. A wife’s favor with her father-in-law may lead to her acceptance for her beauty—no demand could be more exacting. The state of Wei was all but ruined and lost, yet the sacrifices to Kang Shu endured, solely because even common men and women still knew ritual and righteousness. From this, one sees that Heaven’s principles and the people’s constant nature are shared alike by the wayfarer and the sage-kings Yao and Shun. How could the way of the former kings in setting forth the poems, and the work of the Master in editing and transmitting them, be but a small contribution?

A woman cast off by her husband composed a poem, saying:
*"The valley wind blows gently,
now overcast, now raining.
We strove to be of one heart—
why should you be angry?
I gathered mallows, gathered radishes,
not spurning their roots.
Let no word of virtue be forgotten—
together to the death with you.
Slowly I walk the road,
my heart at odds within.
Not far, not near—
you barely see me to the border.
Who says the bitter herb is harsh?
To me it is sweet as watercress.
Joyous in your new marriage,
like brother and sister you are.
The Jing is muddied by the Wei—
how turbid its flow!
Joyous in your new marriage,
you scorn me utterly.
Do not pass my weir,
do not touch my bamboo shoots.
My person is not welcomed—
how should I care for what comes after?
Where it is deep,
I pole my boat, I punt.
Where it is shallow,
I swim, I wade.
Whether present or absent,
I strive to seek it.
When the common folk suffer misfortune,
I crawl to their aid.
Yet you cannot bear me—
instead, you treat me as an enemy.
Having blocked my virtue,
you sell what will not sell.
Once I feared poverty and hardship,
and stood with you in ruin.
Now that we have lived and borne children,
you compare me to poison.
I stored fine provisions,
to ward off the winter.
Joyous in your new marriage,
you use me to fend off hardship.
Furious and violent,
you demand I toil for you.
You do not recall the past—
how I was steadfast in coming to you."*

The record states: Observing the words of the abandoned wife, the ancients compared them to those of loyal ministers and filial sons. Their sincerity and earnestness, the measured grace of their phrasing—these were not truly about such an event. Why? Within the inner chambers, affection often obscures righteousness. Unless one were a peddler or wanderer, who would lightly cast off his wife? Moreover, with the seven grounds for divorce clearly defined and the three conditions for not divorcing established, commoners had no reason to delay remarriage, nor was it permissible to revel in a new union. At the moment of being cast off, the mind is perverse and the words disordered—lacking the skill of a ghostwriter, and devoid of the benefit of learning. How could a woman compose *"Valley Wind"* on her own?

Yet perhaps it was a worthy of Wei, dwelling in a disordered state and serving an benighted lord. When she says *"strive, let no word be forgotten,"* it is the loyalty of heart to heart; when she says *"crawling, I feared hardship,"* it is the affection of hand and foot; when she speaks of *"mallows, radishes, and stored provisions,"* it is the grace of service; when she speaks of *"the Jing muddied, the Wei clear,"* it is the virtue of self-reflection. Yet as the newcomers were now in favor, she could not but be treated with thin courtesy—*"not far, not near"*—and could not but face punishment—*"furious and violent."* As for the heart of the noble man, how could it dwell in such meanness? It would only say: *"My person is not welcomed—how should I care for what comes after?"*

This poem carries a tone of unhurried composure, a spirit of stirring emotion, a principle of resentment without anger, and a sentiment of departure yet lingering regard—who would claim a mere woman could achieve such depth? Among solitary ministers and disinherited sons who read this, few would not set down the poem and sigh.

*The Airs of Zheng* records the admonitions of a worthy husband and wife:
*"The wife says, ‘The cock has crowed.’*
*The husband says, ‘The dawn is dim.’*
*‘Rise and see the night—*
*the bright stars still gleam.’*
*‘We soar, we hover—*
*hunt with fowling arrows, ride with steeds.’*
*‘With arrows we strike them,*
*and with you I’ll prepare the feast.’*
*‘Feast and drink wine,*
*and with you grow old together.’*
*‘Lute and zither in hand,*
*all is serene and good.’"*

The Record states: *Husband and wife determine a household’s survival or ruin. Lute and zither reflect a person’s order or chaos.* A household’s survival hinges on the cock’s crow and the dim dawn. If one indulges in dissipation and excess, life will not flourish; if life does not flourish, the household must falter. A person’s order or chaos hinges on clasping hands and growing old together. If one’s virtue wavers, the home will not thrive; if the home does not thrive, love will surely depart. This tranquility and harmony bear great weight—yet with fury and violence, how can a household’s Way ever be fulfilled?

*"Knowing your coming, I gift you with pendants;*
*knowing your compliance, I present you with pendants;*
*knowing your love, I repay you with pendants."*

The Record states: *When one gives me a peach, I return a plum—this is the common exchange of repayment. When one gives me a quince, I return jade—this is the utmost of sincerity. Thus it is said: ‘Not repayment, but eternal love.’* Yet if, knowing your coming, I present you with pendants—how then should repayment be measured?

Zheng, lost in dissipation and forgetful of return, delights only in *The Quiet Girl* and *The Lacquered Wei*—in city corners and riverbanks, in crimson flutes and peonies. One cannot demand of it kinship with the worthy or friendship with the good, for the duties within the household have already perished. Though its metal rings clear and its elegance lingers, how can the feeling of *The Black Robes* be falsely ascribed to it?

The worthy consort of Qi, attending her lord, would say at the approach of dawn:
*"The parrot has cried, the court is full.*
*Not the parrot’s cry—*
*the buzzing of flies.*
*The east grows bright, the court thrives.*
*Not the east’s brightness—*
*the glow of the moon.*
*Insects hum in flight—*
*how sweet to dream with you.*
*The assembly will soon disperse—*
*let none resent me for detaining you."*

The Record states: *Observing this poem, its meaning is clear, its words harmonious.*

For in ancient times, within the inner chambers of the palace, not only the virtuous women of the boudoir, but even the attendants and tutors—all possessed admonitory teachings and recitations of counsel. Thus their poem declares:

*"The cock has crowed, the court is full."*
—intending to urge the lord to rise early and hold court, yet he instead takes it as *"Not the cock’s crow, but the buzzing of flies."*

Again it says:
*"The east grows bright, the court thrives."*
—intending to urge the lord to rise early and hold court, yet he instead takes it as *"Not the east’s brightness, but the glow of the moon."*

Even as the insects hum in flight and dawn has broken, still he has not risen to attend court. Then she asks: *"How could I not wish to dream with you?"* Yet the assembled ministers, awaiting the lord’s appearance, will soon disperse and depart. *"Must they resent me for detaining you?"*

Here, the phrasing between superior and subordinate flows smoothly, the reasoning stands firm—thus it is preserved for reference.

From the *Shangshu Dazhuan*: In ancient times, when the queen consort was to attend the lord, she would first extinguish the candles, then relight them. Upon entering the chamber, she would remove her court robes and don the informal attire before serving the lord. At cock’s crow, the Grand Master would announce the hour to the lord, whereupon the queen consort would jingle the jade pendants of her girdle in her chamber to signal her departure. Then, the gatekeeper would strike the watchman’s clapper to announce the opening of the gates. Afterward, the Junior Master would report the break of dawn to the lord, and the queen consort would enter the courtyard to stand in attendance as the lord proceeded to court.

It is recorded: By such means, there would be no confusion—no mistaking the cock’s crow for the buzzing of flies, nor would she incur the reproach of removing her hairpin to await punishment. This is preserved for reference.

From the *Waiji*: King Xuan of Zhou once rose late. Queen Jiang removed her hairpin and earrings, awaiting punishment in the secluded lane. She sent her governess to address the king: “The king delights in sensual pleasures and forgets virtue, neglects ritual and rises late—disorder arises from this. As your humble consort, I dare to accept blame.” The king replied: “I lack virtue and have brought this fault upon myself; it is not the queen’s transgression.” Thereafter, he devoted himself to governance, holding early court and adjourning late, ultimately earning the reputation of a revival.

It is recorded: The Jiang clan of Qi were kin by marriage to the Zhou. Thus, both Yi Jiang and Queen Jiang hailed from Qi, and the *Ode of the Cock’s Crow* is also attributed to Qi. Temporally, they are not far apart, and their moral intent is closely aligned—perhaps this was the very admonition Queen Jiang presented. Thus, it was praised as the recitation of a worthy consort and her governess, distinguishing it from the *Greater Elegantiae*. Otherwise, why would one fear being resented for detaining the lord, yet regard the reversal of robes and garments as commonplace? Yet this cannot be verified.

From the *Spring and Autumn Annals*: In the first year of Duke Zhuang of Lu, in winter, the tenth month, the King’s Daughter was married to Qi. In the second year, in autumn, the seventh month, the Queen of Qi died.

It is recorded: This was the King’s Daughter, who upon marriage to Qi became a queen consort. Yet it is written that she “died”—why? For at that time, the Son of Heaven had utterly failed in his lordly duty; the Duke of Qi’s debauchery had reached its nadir; the trepidation of Wen Jiang had vanished; and Duke Zhuang of Lu had abandoned all pretense of avenging shame. Can birds and beasts share the same path as humans? Alas for the King’s Daughter, to be made equal in rank to such as these! The Son of Heaven had reduced himself to the level of beasts—did he not know that even a humble woman’s resolve cannot be forced? Scarcely had she returned to Qi when she departed this world, barely surviving a few months. Was it that her trials and tribulations proved unbearable, her shame too great to endure? Or did the overbearing lust of the Jiang clan drive her to flee, thinking, *“One with a human heart would not conceive such thoughts,”* and so she perished suddenly? The *Book of Changes* says: *“Beset by difficulties, encumbered by obstacles, riding a piebald horse—though a woman remains chaste, she does not bear children.”* The King’s Daughter embodied this. Yet the phoenix among crows, the pearl among stones, cannot be tainted by the vileness of Qi Xiang. Our Master Confucius highlighted her case to curb licentiousness, preserve chastity, shame his contemporaries, and admonish later generations—his intent was profound. Had he merely recorded her marriage and death as matters of protocol, it would have been a superficial account.

In the fourth year of Duke Zhuang, in the third month, Lady Ji of Ji died. In the sixth month, on the day *yiwu*, the Duke of Qi buried Lady Ji of Ji. In the twelfth year, in spring, the third month of the royal calendar, Lady Shu Ji returned to Hao. In the twenty-ninth year, in winter, the twelfth month, Lady Shu Ji died. In the thirtieth year, in the eighth month, on the day *guihai*, Lady Shu Ji was buried.

Hu’s Commentary states: In the fourth year of Duke Zhuang, when the state of Ji was forced into exile, Lady Shu Ji only then returned to the capital. For the Marquis of Ji had just died, and thus Lady Shu Ji returned at that time. The term “return” is used appropriately, as the ancestral temples were in Hao, and she returned to tend to their sacrifices. Lu, as the ancestral state, held the duty of receiving returning women. Though Ji had perished, she did not return to Lu—this was her upholding integrity and duty, refusing to compromise her wifely conduct despite the state’s demise. The people of Lu esteemed her virtue and bestowed upon her enhanced honors and rites. Thus, her return, death, and burial were all meticulously recorded in the historical annals. Our Master Confucius preserved them without omission, to encourage later generations.

It is recorded: Principle and power are the greatest adversaries in the world, yet they are also utterly unequal. When principle prevails, it endures for ten thousand generations without change; when power prevails, it lasts but a moment before being questioned. Why? The heart governs principle, while authority governs power. The authority of a state lies with others, but a woman’s resolve lies within herself. Thus, though Qi’s power could destroy Ji, it could not destroy Lady Ji’s resolve. A lord may be captured, but a wife’s burial rites cannot be seized. The Sage inscribed this in the Classics to reveal the beauty of steadfast integrity and duty, while the evil of Qi, Xiang, and Duke Huan of Lu stands self-condemned without need for reproach. The Commentary suggests that the burial was a display of favor—could this truly be the case?

From the *Commentary*: The Duke of Qi murdered the lord of Lu and annihilated the state of his in-laws, yet he buried their dead with ceremony—this is like inflicting cruelty upon a person and then soothing them with a caress. Such an interpretation is incorrect.

From the *Zuozhuan*: Before Duke Huan of Lu was betrothed to Qi, the Duke of Qi wished to marry Wen Jiang to Prince Hu of Zheng. The prince declined. When asked his reason, he replied: “Each person has their match. Qi is too great—it is not my match.” The *Odes* say: *“Seek abundant fortune for yourself—it lies within me alone. What need have I of a great state?”* The gentleman remarked: *“He was wise to consider his own interests.”* Later, after the prince’s defeat of the Rong army, the Duke of Qi again proposed marriage. The prince firmly refused. When asked his reason, he replied: *“Without business in Qi, I still dared not. Now, at the king’s command, I hasten to Qi’s aid—were I to accept a wife and return, it would be as if I had sold my army’s merit. What would the people say of me?”* Thus, he declined through the Earl of Zheng.

The Record states: Observing the case of Zheng’s Prince Hu, I cannot but lament that the age declines and the Dao wanes, that no hegemon has yet arisen, that a lord cannot protect his ministers and is held hostage by neighboring states, that a father cannot protect his son and must rely on powerful allies. The Five Hegemons’ decree never altered the succession of a ruler’s own son—why then should one wait upon another’s kin? It never made a concubine a wife—why then should one change chambers? If both [declining marriage and accepting it] lead to the loss of one’s state, this would be no different from the adage that the noble change friends and the rich change wives. Why then should one trouble oneself over such matters?

Yet what, then, was Prince Hu to do? Mencius said: *“Act with benevolence and you will be honored; act without it and you will be disgraced.”* Now, to hate disgrace yet dwell in unbenevolence is like hating dampness yet dwelling in low ground. This is what is meant by *“seeking abundant fortune for yourself—it lies within me alone.”*

Prince Hu lived in the age of Duke Zhuang of Zheng, when the Three Bonds had already dissolved. Even if he had striven for goodness, he would still have feared ruin—how much worse, then, that he willingly exchanged hostages, schemed for Di victories, and treated marriage to Qi as a matter of mere weight and consequence!

Some ask: *“Prince Hu once married before performing the ancestral rites, yet now he refuses this marriage—why?”* The answer lies in his being a man pleased with his own trivial virtues. Master Zhu’s criticism of him as *“weak, timid, careless, and impractical”* is apt. One who is pleased with trivial virtues has not yet attained true insight; it is only through indolence and failure to reflect, through impracticality and distance from reality, that he willingly submits to others without demur. The *Poet* rebukes him, saying: *“O reckless youth—how reckless indeed!”* Could this not be his very fault?

From the *Biographies of Exemplary Women*: Lady Xuan of Wei was the daughter of the Marquis of Qi. When she was married to Wei and had reached the city gate, the Lord of Wei died. Her governess said: “You may return now.” The lady did not heed her and entered, observing three years of mourning. When the mourning was complete, her younger brother ascended the throne and requested: “Wei is a small state and cannot accommodate two kitchens. I humbly ask to share one.” The lady refused. The Lord of Wei sent envoys to complain to Qi, and her brothers all wished to yield to him, dispatching messengers to persuade her. Yet the lady remained unmoved.

The compiler notes: Examining the rites, in *Zengzi’s Questions*, it is asked: “If a woman has been received in marriage but is still on the way when her parents die...” There is no text concerning one who has reached the city gate when the lord dies. The gentleman would say: since she had not yet become a wife, there is doubt as to whether she should observe mourning. Yet she observed three years of mourning—was this not excessively generous? Moreover, for a woman who had not yet become a wife to be asked to share a kitchen—was this in accord with ritual? The lord’s younger brother acted like a beast. The customs of Qi were licentious and decadent, so it was fitting that the lady ultimately refused.

Lady Taoying of Lu was the daughter of a Lu family. Widowed young, she raised her orphaned children without strong elder brothers, spinning and weaving to support them. Some in Lu, hearing of her virtue, sought to marry her. Hearing this, she feared she could not escape and composed a song:
*Alas! The yellow wagtail, widowed so soon,*
*Seven years alone, never paired.*
*With neck bent, she sleeps apart,*
*Not among the flock.*
*At midnight she cries in sorrow,*
*Thinking of her lost mate.*
*Heaven decreed early widowhood—*
*Sleeping alone, what harm?*
*A widow ponders this,*
*Tears falling in rows.*
*Alas, how sad!*
*The dead cannot be forgotten.*
*Even flying birds are thus—*
*How much more the chaste and good.*
*Though a worthy mate may come,*
*She will never remarry.*
When the people of Lu heard this, they said: “This lady cannot be won.” And so they dared not pursue her further.

The compiler notes: Observing the *Song of the Yellow Wagtail*, its meaning is earnest, its emotion mournful. It possesses the virtue of the *Feng* poets yet lacks resentful words—truly one who upholds ritual and propriety. Even if creatures of another kind heard it, would they not be moved? How much more so humans. This is the uprightness of wives and concubines, the model of ritual and the Way. Those who cut off their noses, sever their arms, shear their hair, or slice their ears—these cannot be called upright.

Consort Fan was the wife of King Zhuang of Chu. The king loved hunting, and though she remonstrated, he did not cease. Thus she refused to eat the meat of birds and beasts. The king mended his ways and devoted himself to governance. Once, after holding court late into the day, the consort asked: “Why so late? Are you not hungry or weary?” The king replied: “Speaking with the worthy, I forget hunger and fatigue.” The consort asked: “Who are these worthy ones of whom you speak?” He said: “Vigilant Master.” The consort covered her mouth and laughed. The king asked: “Why do you laugh?” She replied: “I have served you for over ten years, sending others to seek beauties to present to you. Now there are two more worthy than I and seven of equal rank. How could I not wish to monopolize your favor? Yet I cannot let private desires obscure the public good—I wish you to know many people. Vigilant Master has served as Chu’s minister for over ten years. Those he recommends are either his kinsmen or relatives; I have never heard of him advancing the worthy or dismissing the unworthy. This is to deceive his lord and block the path of the worthy. Is my laughter not justified?” She reported this to the king, and Vigilant Master left his mat, unable to respond. Thereupon he withdrew from court and sent for Sunshu Ao to serve as prime minister. After three years of his governance, King Zhuang became a hegemon—this was the achievement of Consort Fan.

The compiler notes: That the consort refused to eat the meat of birds and beasts may be called remonstrance through her own conduct. But to use this to advance the worthy—I do not understand it. Sunshu Ao’s worthiness was certainly beyond Vigilant Master’s ken, yet Consort Fan’s reputation was well known. Could it be that the hunting remonstrance was fabricated to support this claim? Yet this cannot be verified.

Lady Gaoxing was a widow of Liang. Her beauty was renowned in appearance and conduct. After her husband’s death, she never remarried. The nobles of Liang vied to marry her, but none succeeded. When the King of Liang heard of this, he sent a minister to propose marriage. She said: “I have heard that a woman’s duty is to remain steadfast after one marriage to preserve her chastity. How could I disregard reputation and honor, willingly debase myself, abandon virtue for profit, and thus fail to be human?” She then took a knife and cut off her nose, saying: “I have already punished myself. The reason I do not die is that I cannot bear to leave my young orphans.” The minister reported this to the king, who admired her righteousness, exalted her conduct, exempted her from taxes, and honored her with the title “Gaoxing.”

The compiler notes: According to ancient ritual, the feudal lords took nine wives, and the two strongest states exceeded this. Few rulers had the principle of not remarrying, lest they abandon virtue for lust. Thus, marrying once was the limit—how could one approach a woman who had lost her integrity? The King of Liang was arrogant and unprincipled, certainly not to be reproached. Yet the women of Liang recorded this in their annals, and readers do not censure the lack of restraint in the Han dynasty or the minister’s failure to remonstrate, instead merely praising the lady’s lofty conduct. Alas! If the lady’s conduct was lofty, how base was the king’s?

From the *Book of Han*: Ban Jieyu was the daughter of Ban Si, a cavalry officer of the Left Section. Gifted and eloquent, when Emperor Cheng toured the rear palace, he once wished to share her palanquin. She declined, saying: “In ancient paintings, the sagely rulers all had famous ministers at their side. By the end of the Three Dynasties, rulers had female favorites. If I were to share your palanquin, would it not resemble this?” The emperor praised her words and desisted. When the Empress Dowager heard of this, she rejoiced, saying: “In ancient times there was Consort Fan; today there is Jieyu.” Whenever she recited the *Book of Songs*, particularly the *Odes of the Fair and Good Maiden* and *The Female Instructor*, she would repeat them thrice. When Jieyu appeared, her demeanor always followed ancient ritual. Later, Zhao Feiyan gained favor and acted wantonly, and her partisans slandered Jieyu, saying: “She practices sorcery and curses.”

The emperor questioned her further, and Jieyu replied: “I have heard that life and death are determined by fate, and wealth and honor lie with Heaven. If one cultivates uprightness yet remains unrewarded, what can be gained by resorting to wickedness? Moreover, if ghosts and spirits possess awareness, they would not accept the complaints of the disloyal. If they lack awareness, what benefit would complaints bring? Thus, I have not done so.” The emperor approved of her response and pitied her. Fearing prolonged danger, Jieyu requested to serve the Empress Dowager at Changxin Palace, and the emperor granted her wish. When the emperor passed, she was assigned to tend the imperial mausoleum. Upon her death, she was buried within its grounds.

The chronicler remarks: Observing Jieyu’s adherence to righteousness, I lament Ban Gu’s lack of discernment. For women, the loss of favor and the ebb of influence are commonplace. Yet to preserve one’s wisdom and safeguard oneself is the mark of a true gentleman. The perils of treacherous schemes and fleeting power are like wildfire—so the *Book of Songs* says: *“The blaze spreads through the poplars.”* And again: *“Who can endure scorching heat? It cannot be restrained, nor can one draw near to warm oneself.”* Thus, it is better to dwell in seclusion, hidden like a dragon in still waters, entrusting oneself to the humble currents of Changxin Palace, than to be scorched and blinded, becoming the foremost sinner of the inner chambers. Had Ban Gu understood this principle, he might have rested upon the classics, reclined in a modest gatehouse, untethered above and unrooted below—would this not have been the lofty attainment of the enlightened and the noble integrity of the wise? Instead, he obsessed over schemes for advancement, plotting from dawn to dusk, clinging to the gates of power, and wading through treacherous paths. The words of his *Discourse on Guests* cannot be mentioned in the same breath as the sentiments of Ban Jieyu’s *Song of the Round Fan*. With Ban Gu’s vast knowledge of past and present, hailed as a master historian, how could his judgment of character, his grasp of the great principles of conduct, fall short of a woman’s? Yet he could not escape the triumph of substance over form—a cause for profound regret among gentlemen.

Empress Wang of Emperor Ping was Wang Mang’s daughter, gentle and virtuous with steadfast conduct. When Emperor Ping ascended the throne, Wang Mang wielded power and betrothed his daughter to the emperor. A year later, the emperor died, and after Wang Mang usurped the throne, the empress, then eighteen, frequently claimed illness and refused to attend court. Wang Mang, both reverent and grieving, considered marrying her off. He ordered Chengxin, Duke of the State and son of the General of the Establishment, along with his heir Xiang, to prepare physicians and inquire after her health. The empress flew into a rage, flogging her attendants, and thereafter took to her bed, refusing to rise. Wang Mang dared not press her further. When Han forces executed Wang Mang and set fire to Weiyang Palace, the empress declared: “How can I face the Han house?” She threw herself into the flames and perished.

The chronicler remarks: Did Empress Ping’s defiance of her father compare to Empress Yuan’s reproach of Wang Mang? The devotion of a dutiful wife and the longevity of a filial mother have been praised through the ages—who would have thought it could be otherwise? Empress Yuan of Han lived to eighty, spanning the reigns of Emperors Yuan, Cheng, Ai, and Ping, serving as the mother of the realm for over sixty years. Her brothers wielded power in succession, holding the reins of state, and thus she nurtured and protected them, enabling their rebellion. Only when Wang Mang usurped the throne and sought to replace the Liu with the Wang did she grasp the imperial seal to resist him—alas, too late. She was not as admirable as one so young who upheld her principles.

The *Later Han History* records: In the first year of *Zhongyuan* of Emperor Guangwu (34 CE), the emperor dispatched the Minister of Works to announce at the Temple of the High Ancestor: “The High Emperor decreed that none but the Liu clan should be enfeoffed as kings. Yet Empress Lü murdered Prince Zhao and monopolized power for the Lü clan. By the grace of the altars of soil and grain, Lü Lu and Lü Chan were executed. Heaven’s mandate nearly fell, but the perilous court was restored. Empress Lü is unworthy to share sacrifices with the High Emperor in the ancestral temple or to be honored alongside the supreme. Empress Bo, however, was virtuous, kind, and filial. Emperor Wen ruled with wisdom, and his descendants enjoyed blessings that endure to this day. Thus, let Empress Bo be honored as *High Empress* and share sacrifices at the Earth Altar. Let the spirit tablet of Empress Lü be moved to her garden temple, where offerings shall be made seasonally.”

The chronicler remarks: Observing the fates of the Lü and Bo empresses, I am struck by how fortune and misfortune, prosperity and decline, hinge upon the slightest shifts in timing. When the empress and the emperor first rose from obscurity, enduring countless battles to seek him in the marshes—this was one moment. When the emperor favored Consort Qi and doted on Prince Ru Yi, the balance of power shifting—this was another. When she arrogantly assumed regency, ruling the realm from the throne—this was yet another. At its extreme, there arose the *Book of Metal and Stone*, the poison of the zhen and the zhi birds, the calamity of clan extermination, and the schemes to change the dynasty. By the principles of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, this was self-annihilation before Heaven—no prayers could avail. Yet the great ministers of the Han court failed to uphold their oaths of blood, nor did they condemn her by the standards of the *Spring and Autumn*. With this principle unclarified, it is no wonder that the Lü were overthrown and the Xin usurped the throne. Thus, it was fitting for the emperor to elevate Bo and demote Lü.

Wang Ba, a man of lofty integrity in his youth, had a wife of equal virtue and conduct. When Wang Mang usurped the throne, Wang Ba severed all ties with officialdom. During the *Jianwu* era, he was summoned to the capital but refused to yield. He had once been friends with Linghu Zibo of the same commandery. Later, Zibo became Chancellor of Chu, and his son served as a clerk in the commandery. When the son was sent to deliver a letter to Wang Ba, he arrived in grand style, with carriages, horses, and an entourage befitting his rank. Wang Ba’s own son was plowing in the fields when he heard a guest had arrived. He set down his plow and returned home, whereupon he saw Linghu’s son, disheveled and ashamed, unable to lift his gaze. After the guest departed, the son lingered outside, unwilling to enter. His mother, puzzled, asked the reason. Wang Ba replied: “Zibo and I were never equals. Earlier, I saw his son—his appearance and attire were radiant, his bearing refined. Yet my son is unkempt, gap-toothed, and ignorant of propriety. The depth of a father’s love made me unconsciously lose composure.” His wife said: “You cultivate purity and integrity, heedless of rank and emolument. Now that Zibo has risen in status, how does he compare to your loftiness? Why abandon your long-held principles and feel shame before a mere child?”

Wang Ba burst into laughter and said: “Indeed so!” Thereupon, they retreated into seclusion for the rest of their lives.

The record states: Why judge a person not by what they strive for, but by what they overlook? For the bonds of poverty and lowliness are hard to forget, yet when one compares oneself to another, it is difficult to let go of such thoughts. Even a minor grievance can diminish the bond of shared hardship. How profound was the insight of Wang Ba’s wife—free from self, free from others, free from worldly attachments, let alone the vagaries of世态. If one can act thus, one naturally descends from the hall of vanity, without need for deep mountains or dense forests.

Bao Xuan’s wife, née Huan, styled Shaojun, once studied under Shaojun’s father. Her father, admiring Bao’s purity and frugality, gave his daughter to him in marriage, sending her off with a lavish dowry. Bao was displeased and said to his wife: “Shaojun was raised in wealth and luxury, accustomed to fine adornments, while I am truly poor and lowly. I dare not accept such gifts.” His wife replied: “My father saw that you cultivate virtue and live simply, so he sent me, his humble daughter, to serve you with towel and comb. Since I now attend a gentleman, I will follow your command.” Bao smiled and said: “If you can do so, it aligns with my aspirations.” His wife then returned all her attendants and fine garments, donning coarse hempen skirts instead. Together, they pulled a deer-cart back to their hometown, where she bowed to her mother-in-law, carried jars to fetch water, and diligently observed the way of a wife. Their village praised her.

The record states: The allure of softness and charm not only undermines resolve but also fosters transgression. Sima Xiangru, though talented and refined, devoted himself to the zither’s seductive melodies. Ma Rong, a scholar of renown, delighted in his crimson curtains. I have seen how poverty and lowliness can sway a man, just as wealth and nobility can lead him astray. How then could he remain unyielding before power and force? Thus, only with conduct like Shaojun’s can one attain the integrity of Zidu.

The wife of Huangfu Gui of Anding was skilled in composition and calligraphy. After Gui’s death, she remained in the prime of her beauty. Dong Zhuo, hearing of her reputation, sent a betrothal gift of a hundred carriages laden with silk and treasures, twenty horses, and slaves and servants filling the road. The wife, dressed in plain garments, arrived at Dong’s gate, knelt, and pleaded her refusal with bitter sorrow. Dong ordered his attendants to draw their blades and encircle her, declaring: “My authority and teachings are meant to make the four seas submit. How could they not prevail over a mere woman?” The wife stood and cursed him: “You are but a barbarian spawn, poisoning the realm—do you not yet realize this? My ancestors were men of pure virtue through the generations. The Huangfu clan produced talents in both civil and martial arts, loyal ministers of Han. You, sir, are no more than a lackey sent to run errands. How dare you presume to act improperly toward the wife of your lord?”

The enraged Dong dragged her carriage into the courtyard, suspended her head from the axle, and whipped the horses to gallop in all directions until she died beneath the wheels. Later generations extolled her and painted her likeness, calling her the "Paragon of Propriety."

The record states: How do Guan’s resolve and his wife’s stand compare to Lady Ying’s and Kong Rong’s? Guan’s shame lay in not joining the clique, while his wife’s courage lay in not compromising herself—peerless in virtue, they need feel no shame. Yet Kong Rong, mindful of Dong Zhuo’s favor, was ultimately executed; Lady Ying, too, at Cao Cao’s tribunal, bowed her head in bitter lament. Thus, one preserved integrity while the other did not, one lived while the other died—no comparison can be made between them.

Empress Xianmu, the middle daughter of Cao Cao, was elevated to Lady in the twenty-ninth year of Jian’an. After Empress Fu’s murder, she was enthroned as empress. When Wei received the abdication, envoys were sent to demand the imperial seal and sash. The empress, furious, refused, and this occurred several times. Finally, she summoned the envoys inside, personally berated them with the seal and sash in hand, cast them beneath the carriage rail, and wept uncontrollably, saying: "Heaven will not bless you." Those around her could not bear to look up.

In the first year of Jingchu, she passed away and was interred in Shan Mausoleum, with carriages, robes, and rites all following Han precedent.

The record states: In the Spring and Autumn period, Yong Ji asked her mother: "Who is dearer, father or husband?" Her mother replied: "Any man may be a husband, but a father is only one—how can they be compared?" Yet if a father’s deeds resemble those of Wang Mang or Cao Cao, can one still value father over husband? Observing the deeds of Empress Ping and Empress Xian, the crime of Yong Ji in killing her husband and the fault of Zhong Mu in indulging her daughter can never be undone.

**On the Righteousness of Husband and Wife**

From *The Book of Jin*: Princess Consort Wang of the Crown Prince Minhuai, styled Huifeng, was the daughter of Grand Commandant Yan. She was chaste and gentle, possessed of resolve and integrity. When the Crown Prince was deposed and confined to Jintang City, Yan memorialized to dissolve the marriage. Huifeng wailed and returned home, moving all who witnessed her to tears along the road.

Later, when Liu Yao breached Luoyang, he seized her and bestowed her upon his general, Qiao Shu. As they crossed the Meng Ford on the Yellow River, intending to take her as his wife, Huifeng drew her sword and rebuked Shu, saying: *"I am the wife of the Crown Prince of the August Emperor, the daughter of the Minister of Works—how dare a petty barbarian cur like you lay hands on me?"* With these words, she cast herself into the river. Her attendant concubine, named Liuchu, was the granddaughter of Wei Junyi’s admonisher. Seeing her mistress’s resolve, she declared: *"If the great one has done so, the lesser should do the same."* And she too leapt into the river.

The record states: Observing the customs of Jin, I find them benighted and deluded, ever prizing hollow reputations while heedless of flaws and faults. Yet these two women were jades among rubble, ice within a vessel. Yan, though of no worth, busied himself with schemes for three burrows and hastened to sever the marriage, yet in the end, his own integrity was wanting. Had it not been for their steadfast conduct, how could their purity have been preserved? Compared to those who, like crumbling walls, were crushed to death, they were true jewels among pebbles—how could they be ranked among the common stones?

The calamity of empty discourse left the court unable to shield the state, the elite unable to protect themselves, and the common folk unable to safeguard their sons and daughters. Alas, how grievous! This is a warning for all ages.

From *The Old Book of Tang*:

On one occasion, after Emperor Taizong dismissed court and withdrew to the palace, he raged, saying, “I must kill that old rustic!” At the time, Empress Zhangsun stood beside him. She asked, “Of whom do you speak?” The emperor replied, “Wei Zheng is so insolent—he humiliates me at every court assembly.” The empress withdrew, then reappeared in full court robes, standing in the courtyard. Startled, the emperor asked the reason. She said, “Your servant has heard that when the lord is enlightened, his ministers are forthright. Now that Wei Zheng is forthright, it is because Your Majesty is enlightened. How dare I not offer congratulations?” The emperor was pleased.

The record observes: The emperor’s anger was not truly an affront from Wei Zheng, but rather a lapse in the purity of his own heart. The empress’s congratulations were not a true alignment of her heart, but merely delight in a fine reputation. Had she truly understood the importance of a pure heart, she would not have rejoiced in this. And had she recognized the urgency of employing worthy men, she would not have been angered by it. Had the empress of later times not been so enlightened, Wei Zheng would have had cause to repay the grace of Wen’s virtue; and had the prince not lost his marriage, the empress would have had no way to dispel the resentment of that old rustic.

Consort Xu Hui, upon hearing of the campaigns to subdue Goguryeo in the east and conquer Kucha in the west, the successive construction of Cuiwei and Yuhua Palaces, and the extravagance of imperial adornments and luxuries, submitted a memorial in remonstrance: “To exhaust finite agricultural labor filling boundless waves, to pursue unsecured foreign multitudes at the cost of our own seasoned troops—this is to repeat the errors of old. When the First Emperor of Qin annexed the six kingdoms, he only hastened the foundations of peril and ruin. When Emperor Wu of Jin overran the three regions, he merely completed the work of collapse and defeat. Was this not the result of pride in achievement, reliance on might, abandonment of virtue, disregard for the state, pursuit of gain while forgetting danger, and indulgence of desire?”

Jewels and curios, craft and artifice—these are the axes that hew down states; pearls and jades, brocades and embroideries—these are the poison that bewilders the heart. To model governance on frugality is still to fear excess; to model it on excess, how can later generations be restrained?

The emperor praised her words.

It is recorded: In the reign of Taizong, how did one virtuous consort come to such renown? For the rise of Tang was but the reversal of Sui’s old ways, and the excellence of its governance was the achievement of heeding remonstrance. Thus, no one treated it as taboo, nor did near or distant kin deem it presumptuous. Were even the sinew-and-bone ministers of the state’s discipline to soften into pliable compliance, how much more so a woman of virtue within the palace chambers?

Gaozong summoned Changsun Wuji, Li Ji, Yu Zhihe, and Chu Suiliang to the inner palace. Suiliang said: “Today’s summons concerns the empress. The emperor’s will is already set—opposition means certain death. The Grand Commandant is the emperor’s maternal uncle, the Minister Over the Masses a meritorious minister. We must not allow the emperor to bear the name of killing his uncle or his meritorious ministers.” Suiliang, risen from humble origins without military merit, had attained his present rank and, moreover, received the late emperor’s charge. If he did not contest this even at the cost of his life, how could he face the former emperor in the underworld?

Li Ji claimed illness and did not attend. Suiliang then entered the inner palace with Wuji and the others. The emperor turned to them and said: “The empress has no son, while Lady Wu has borne a son. I now intend to install Lady Wu as empress. What say you?”

Suiliang replied: “The empress comes from a distinguished family, chosen for Your Majesty by the late emperor. As he lay dying, he took Your Majesty’s hand and said to me: ‘I entrust my fine son and fine daughter-in-law to you.’ Your Majesty heard these words yourself; they still ring in our ears. The empress has committed no fault—how can she be lightly deposed?”

The emperor was displeased and dismissed them. The next day, he raised the matter again. Suiliang said: “If Your Majesty is determined to replace the empress, I beg you to select from the finest families of the realm. Why must it be the Wu clan? I ask to be excused from the Three Departments.” He added: “If I now act against Your Majesty’s wishes, I deserve death.”

He then placed his official tablet upon the palace steps, removed his headscarf, and kowtowed until blood flowed, pleading to be allowed to retire to his fields. The emperor, enraged, ordered him dragged away. Behind the curtain, the Lady Wu cried out loudly: “Why not beat that old meddler to death?” Wu Zetian said: “Suiliang received the late emperor’s dying charge—he cannot be punished.” Later, Li Ji entered and said: “This is Your Majesty’s family matter; why consult outsiders further?” The emperor’s resolve was thus settled.

A record states: At that time, Wu Zetian, Suiliang, and Li Ji’s loyalties remained undivided as the Jing and Wei rivers. Yet with a single word the next day, the ancestral temples, altars of state, imperial lineage, collateral branches, all ministers, and every official of the Tang stood perilously close to ruin. If Li Ji, favored by the emperor, was indeed the one who should have spoken, then who was truly fit to advise? Suiliang’s courage in correcting the wrong ensured that for ten thousand generations hence, the duties of ruler and minister, husband and wife, and friends would still be known. Had Li Ji spoken first, the late emperor’s words—“my fine son and fine daughter-in-law”—would have been dismissed as unheard, and the principles of Heaven and the hearts of men nearly extinguished. Though his words could not reverse fate, his righteousness shone as bright as the sun; a gentleman cannot but record them.

The Valiant Lady Yang was the wife of Li Kan. When Bian Prefecture fell, enemy forces divided to subdue the surrounding counties. Fearing the city too small and the rebels too fierce, Li Kan wished to abandon it. At the end of the Jianzhong era, when Li Xilie’s forces arrived, Li Kan served as magistrate of Qingcheng. His wife said: “When the enemy comes, we must defend. If our strength fails, we die—who will hold the city if we flee?” Li Kan replied: “We lack soldiers and supplies; what can be done?” His wife said: “If the county is not defended, the land becomes the rebels’ land; the granaries and treasuries, their stores; the people, their soldiers.”

And what would remain for the state? Offer generous rewards to recruit brave men—there may yet be a way to prevail.” Li Kan then summoned the officials and people to the courtyard and said: “Qingcheng is indeed your home, but when my term ends, I shall depart, unlike you, who live on this land where your ancestors’ graves lie. Should we not stand together and die in its defense? How could we bear to bow northward and serve the rebels?” The crowd wept and pledged their allegiance. He then proclaimed: “Those who hurl tiles and stones at the enemy shall be rewarded with a thousand coins; those who slay the enemy with blades and arrows, ten thousand.” Several hundred men were thus assembled and led to the city walls. The lady herself cooked meals to feed the defenders and sent word to the rebels: “The elders of Qingcheng will not surrender. Even if you take our city, it will not enhance your might—you would do better to withdraw at once, for you stand only to lose without gain.” Just then, a rebel commander was struck by an arrow and died, whereupon the enemy retreated. The county remained intact, and Li Kan was later promoted to magistrate of Taiping.

Earlier, during the Wan’nian Tongtian era, when the Khitan raided Pingzhou, Zou Baoying served as prefect. As the city teetered on the brink of collapse, his wife Xi led their household servants and maidservants to defend the walls without yielding. By imperial decree, she was posthumously honored as Lady of Sincere Loyalty. When Mocho attacked Feigu, the wife of the county magistrate Gu Xuanying—Lady Gao—held the city fast, and was later granted the title Lady of Loyalty. During Shi Siming’s rebellion, three women—Hou of Weizhou, Tang of Huazhou, and Wang of Qingzhou—pledged their lives, rushed to the military camp, and joined the fight against the rebels. Xu Shuyuan, the military commissioner of Hua and Pu, reported their valor, and all were appointed as *guoyi* officers. Though such women never forgot their duty to the state, none matched the resolute understanding of the great principles of ruler and subject displayed by the Valiant Lady Yang.

**Recorded Note:** Reviewing the *Tang History*’s accounts of valiant women, most lack coherence, but this record is unusually well-documented, with clear beginnings and ends. Moreover, its praise and censure are never careless—could this not shame the present age? Li Kan, too, was a man who followed others to his death, yet he turned calamity into fortune. When the twenty-four prefectures heard of this, would they not spit in shame at their own cowardice? For not only was there one valiant lady, but three women who would not cease their efforts.

Emperor Wuzong’s favored consort, Lady Wang, was quick-witted by nature. At thirteen, she entered the palace. When the emperor was still Prince of Ying, Emperor Muzong bestowed her upon him. Upon his accession, she was promoted to *cairen* and enjoyed great favor, her gentle compliance much like that of Empress Shun. Whenever the emperor hunted in the imperial park, she always accompanied him, her hunting attire as splendid as his own. They rode side by side, and onlookers could not tell which was the emperor. The emperor wished to make her empress, but Li Deyu opposed it. The emperor grew increasingly obsessed with Daoist alchemists, who claimed: “If I attain immortality, the empress will not share in it, and her beauty will fade.” Lady Wang was deeply troubled. The emperor asked: “If the unthinkable should happen, what would you do?” She wept and replied: “After Your Majesty’s eternal reign, I would follow you in death.” The emperor said no more. As his end neared, the *cairen* took all her stored treasures and distributed them among the palace women. Once she confirmed the emperor had passed, she hanged herself beneath the eaves. Though some among the palace women had once resented her, they now admired her loyalty and were moved to tears.

**Recorded Note:** Following in burial was not an ancient custom, nor was hunting a virtuous pastime. Yet this account is included because, in the Tang dynasty, there were no proper norms for the inner palace, and the emperor’s indulgence in extravagance and excess was particularly worthy of reflection—not merely for the sake of the *cairen*, but as a warning to all.

From the *History of the Song*: Cui, the wife of Bao Yi, was the daughter-in-law of Bao Zheng. Yi died young, leaving behind an infant son. Bao Zheng and his wife suspected Cui would not remain chaste, so they tested her resolve by having their attendants observe her. Cui, disheveled and weeping, said to Bao Zheng: “You are a renowned statesman. I, a humble woman, am honored to serve as your daughter-in-law, performing menial tasks like sweeping and washing. How could I dare defile your household? In life, I am Bao’s wife; in death, I shall be Bao’s ghost. I swear I will never betray this vow.” Later, her son also died. Cui’s mother, Lü, arrived from Xingzhou and tried to persuade her to remarry, saying: “You mourned your husband and guarded your son. Now your son is gone—whom will you guard?” Cui replied: “I did not do this for my son, but for my parents-in-law. Now that my father-in-law has passed, my mother-in-law is aged—how could I bear to leave her?” Lü grew angry: “I would rather die than return alone.” Cui said: “You have come from afar; it would be unjust to let you return alone. But if, upon reaching Xingzhou, you are forced into an unrighteous marriage, I will die by the sword.” They departed together, and Lü, fearing her daughter’s resolve, ultimately dared not compel her.

Bao Zheng once had a concubine who bore a son while staying with her parents. Cui secretly supported the child’s mother, ensuring she cared for him properly. Later, she brought the boy back and named him Dan, so that he might continue the Bao ancestral rites.

**Recorded Note:** Bao Zheng once declared: “If any of my descendants in office commit corruption, they shall not be allowed to return to the family home, nor shall they be buried in the ancestral cemetery. Whoever defies my will is no child or grandchild of mine.” Such was his severity—yet why did he not consider his daughter-in-law’s plight? Why did he allow his attendants to test her? If even the wife of Bao Zheng faced such pressure and suspicion, what hope is there for others? Those who set examples must exercise the utmost caution. Cui not only remained steadfast in her loyalty but also secretly supported her husband’s illegitimate son to preserve the family line. This was no mere act of wifely duty—heaven, it seems, truly favored Bao Zheng’s integrity.

Zhao, the wife of Fu Cha, was the daughter of Fu Pu. Cha was the nephew of Fu Yaoyu. From childhood, he was devoted to learning and indifferent to power and wealth. At eighteen, he passed the imperial examination but had not yet undergone the palace examination. Cai Jing, seeking to recruit him, sent his son Cai Tao and several guards to press him repeatedly, even offering his daughter in marriage. Cha refused to respond. When they forced a meeting, he would not comply.

Later, he ultimately became the son-in-law of Minister Qingxian. Those with discernment already knew his character and capacity were not easily measured. When he served as Vice Minister of War and was sent as an envoy to the Jin, the barbarians had already broken their treaty. Some advised him not to rush, but he replied immediately: "I accepted the imperial command to depart; if I halt upon hearing of danger, how can I answer to my sovereign’s charge?" He proceeded without delay. When he encountered Wanyan Zongbi’s army, the envoy demanded he bow—he refused. Though blades surrounded him like a forest, and some forced him to prostrate himself, he stood firm, unmoved, and argued repeatedly. Turning to his subordinates, Attendants Hou Yan and others, he said: "My death is certain. When my parents hear of it, they will grieve deeply. I pray you remember my words and tell them I died for the state, that this may slightly ease their endless sorrow." He was then killed. When Yan and the others returned, they recounted Fu Cha’s unyielding resolve, his steadfast loyalty so vividly evident. Those who heard were moved to sorrow and admiration.

The Record states: The daughter of Qingxian and the wife of Xiaosu—how their names stand side by side! Fu Cha refused Cai Jing’s overtures and married into the Zhao family, acting without coercion. Thus, when he was sent as an envoy and died for his country, was this mere happenstance? He valued his person highly, hence his strict choice of a spouse; he cherished his kin deeply, hence his unwavering fidelity. The Zhao family’s honor is all the greater—far beyond what Cui or Lü endured under duress.

Lü Zhi’s wife was of the Wu clan. When Zhi was recruited to Zhang Jun’s headquarters, it coincided with Yue Fei’s plan for a major campaign against the Jin. Qin Hui, jealous of Fei, spoke against him to Emperor Gaozong. When Fei came to discuss matters with Commander Zhang Jun, Jun said: "Wang De, commander of the Huai-West army, wishes to be appointed as overall commander. I intend to have you, as a staff officer from the Supervisory Headquarters, lead him—what do you think?" Fei replied: "De and Li Qiong have long been at odds; if you suddenly place Qiong above him, conflict will surely arise. Minister Lü is unversed in military affairs and may not command the troops’ respect." Jun then asked: "What of Zhang Jun and Yang Yizhong?" Fei answered: "Zhang, as Military Commissioner, was once my superior—he is harsh and lacking in strategy. Yizhong is no better than De; how can he command such an army?" Jun, struck by his words, said: "I knew none but you could lead them." Fei replied: "You asked me directly, so I dare not withhold my humble opinion—how could I think of currying favor?" In the end, Jun appointed Wang De as Commander-in-Chief, with Li Qiong as his deputy, and Lü Zhi as military advisor.

When Qiong and De clashed in court, the emperor ordered De to return to Jiankang, placing his army under the Supervisory Headquarters, and sent Zhi to Luzhou to take command. An imperial messenger was dispatched to present him with saddled horses. Zhi bowed to receive the gift and told his family: "Such is the emperor’s command—how can I refuse on principle? I do not fear death, but I fear it will be of no benefit to the state." He and his wife, Wu, wept as they bade each other farewell. Upon arrival, he addressed Qiong and the others: "If you believe yourselves in the right, then you greatly deceive me. Prime Minister Zhang merely favors those who advance boldly; if you achieve merit, even grave faults will be overlooked—how much more minor grievances? You must strive to justify yourselves; I assure you, there is nothing to fear." Qiong and the others were moved to tears.

Once the situation had somewhat stabilized, he secretly memorialized the throne to have the appointment revoked. However, a clerk leaked the contents, and Qiong had the courier intercepted, obtaining the full memorial. Enraged, he happened just then to receive a summons from the court, which had appointed Zhang Jun as Pacification Commissioner of Huaixi and Yang Yizhong as Military Commissioner, ordering Qiong to report to the imperial presence. Fearing the consequences, Qiong rebelled.

That morning, the generals came to pay their respects to Zhi. Once seated, Qiong drew a document from his sleeve and said, “What crime have the officers of this army committed, that such matters should be reported to the court?” Zhi, seeing it, was greatly alarmed and tried to flee, but was too late—Qiong seized him. At the moment of his death, someone retrieved the cloth Zhi had used to bind his hair and returned it to Wu. His wife, née Wu, took the cloth and hanged herself, burying it with a dog. All who heard of it were moved to tears.

**Record:** Envy is a vicious power—whether in the highest courts or the greatest armies, whether among the worthy and loyal ministers and martyrs, or the foolish and rebellious generals and soldiers, none escape its harm. Had Qin Kuai tolerated Yue Fei, then Zhang Jun would not have been provoked to anger. Had Zhang Jun not been provoked, then affairs would not have gone so awry. Had affairs not gone awry, then disaster would not have struck so swiftly, and Qiong’s rebellion and Zhi’s death might never have come to pass. Thus, that hair-binding cloth was the very token of Qin Kuai’s treachery hastening Zhi’s end. Yet even so, Zhang Jun ought to have done all in his power to make amends to Zhi. In the unseen realm, he owes this good friend a debt—how then can he still hope for the restoration of the realm? For before the defeat at Fuli, the very deliberations of the Supervisory Headquarters had already made clear to men of virtue that nothing could be achieved.

Chen Yin’s wife, née Du, was the daughter of Chen Xian, a *Bao Mo Ge Dai Zhi* and son of Chen Cheng. Yin, appointed to office through imperial favor, served as Prefect of Xihe. Xihe was a critical frontier stronghold, yet Yin, though a scholar, did not shrink from the peril. When the Yuan forces invaded, the regional commander He Jin was assigned to defend Da’an, leaving only Commander Wang Rui and a thousand loyalists to hold the city. Yin swore to defend the land alongside its people, keeping his three sons with him. He distributed all his family’s wealth to rally the loyalists, determined to hold the city at all costs. When a Yuan army of one hundred thousand attacked, Yin led the loyalists and敢死士 in fierce battle, clashing dozens of times day and night, until the enemy retreated. However, He Jin had long been at odds with Yin, and the other generals, jealous of his merit, ignored his urgent pleas for aid. The city fell.

Turning to his wife, Du, Yin said, “Make haste to save yourself.” Du replied in a stern voice, “How can one share in the lord’s salary in life but not in his service in death?” She drank poison and died. Yin then donned his court robes, faced the palace, burned incense, and wept aloud: “I first resolved to defend this city as a bulwark for Shu. Now that the city has fallen, it is my duty to die.” He bowed twice and fell upon his sword. Twenty-eight members of his family and household perished with him. Judicial Officer Jia Zikun, Prefect of Wenzhou Liu Rui, *Tongpan* of Jinzhou Sai Yi, and *Tongpan* of Lizhou He Chong all died with their entire households. When Chong was captured, the enemy set up a tent with a ring of seats, leaving the guest’s seat empty for him. Chong said, “I have served the Zhao for three generations. To die for them is no regret.” As he was about to be executed, his wife, née Chen, bowed twice and said, “My husband and I can face the Zhao without shame.” Then she died.

**Record:** Yin’s father, Chen Cheng, was so enraged by the rebellion of the Shu general Wu Xi that he could not bear to take up arms against him. Instead, he shaved his head and donned Buddhist robes to disgrace himself. Yet Yin alone roused himself to slay the traitor. Though his strength failed and he died, he brought glory to his father’s name. Among his contemporaries—Jia, Liu, Sai, and He—entire families displayed such righteous heroism that it moved Heaven and stirred men’s hearts. Had they been gathered at court and entrusted with the nation’s vital affairs, they could have transformed weakness into strength and peril into safety with ease. Instead, they were scattered to distant posts, left to guard isolated cities in lowly positions, without reinforcements or capable commanders, and surrounded by envious and petty men. Their blood nourished the battlefield—what benefit did it bring to the state? Thus, when the Dao prevails in the world, heroes are put to use; when the Dao is lost, even the boldest are left without a home. Who, hearing this, does not weep tears of grief?

Zhao Angfa’s wife, née Yong. Angfa, having passed the imperial examinations as a *shang she*, served as *Tongpan* of Chizhou. When the Yuan forces crossed the Yangtze, the Prefect of Chi, Wang Qizong, abandoned his post. Angfa took charge of the prefecture, repairing the walls and stockpiling grain to prepare for a siege. When Yuan scouts reached Liwang River, the regional commander Zhang Lin urged him to surrender. Angfa’s fury filled his chest, his eyes blazing, and Lin dared not speak further. Later, Lin secretly sent envoys to offer surrender while publicly aiding Angfa in defending the city, though all authority fell to Lin. Realizing the situation was hopeless, Angfa held a farewell feast for his relatives and friends. To his wife, Yong, he said, “When the city falls, I, as its defender, cannot flee. You should escape first.” Yong replied, “You are an appointed official, and I am an appointed lady. You are a loyal minister—am I not to be a loyal minister’s wife?” Angfa smiled and said, “This is no task for a woman.” The next day, he distributed his family’s wealth among his younger brothers, nephews, and servants, sending them all away.

As the Yuan army pressed against the city, Angfa rose at dawn and wrote nine times: “One cannot betray the state; the city cannot surrender. Husband and wife die together—our integrity is complete.” Then he and Yong, dressed in their finest robes, hanged themselves together in the *Congrong* Hall. Angfa had built this hall earlier and once hosted guests there, pointing to its plaque and saying, “The ancients said: ‘To die with righteous fervor is easy; to die with calm resolve is hard.’” In the end, he fulfilled those words.

**Record:** I have observed Zhao Angfa’s *Congrong* Hall and Jiang Wanli’s *Zhishui* Pavilion—none of their contemporaries understood their intent. Yet these two men had already resolved their hearts in times of peace. Compare them to Dong Songchen and Lu Yunsheng’s *Furong* Pavilion and *Xianglan* Pavilion, Jia Sidao’s *Duobao* Pavilion and *Mumian* Hermitage, or Qin Kuai’s *Yide Getian*—fragrant and foul, how vast is the difference!

Alas! When the world follows the Dao, we sing the *Ode to the Hall of Mulberry*; when the world loses the Dao, we suffer the calamity of earth and wood. How much better is this hall, which adds luster to the annals of history!

Xie Fangde’s wife was Lady Li. Fangde was a man of heroic spirit—when he read, he took in five lines at once, never forgetting what he had seen. He roused himself with loyalty and righteousness. When the Yuan forces pressed southward, he served as Commissioner for Inspection along the Yangtze and Prefect of Xinzhou in Jiangdong. The following year, Lü Shikui and Military Commissioner Wu divided Jiangdong between them. Fangde led troops to resist them, rallying the Huai soldier Zhang Xiaozhong at Anren for battle. Defeated, he fled to Xinzhou, but when the city fell, he changed his name and entered Jianning. Disguised in hempen robes and straw sandals, he wailed at the borderlands, unrecognized—people took him for a sick man.

In the twenty-third year of the Zhiyuan era, Academician Cheng Wenhai recommended twenty-two former officials of the Song, placing Fangde first on the list. He declined the summons. Minister Liu Mengyan later recommended him again. Fangde wrote to Mengyan: “In the south, there are no men of talent—one seeks even a flawed Lü Yi in vain. As Cheng Ying and the Pestle said: ‘Not even a menial servant can be found.’ When King Zhou perished, though he had the finest troops of eight hundred states, none dared resist. The forthright counsel of those two men—King Wu and the Grand Duke—was met with awe and rejection. Now I am over sixty, and all I lack is death. What other hope could I have?”

The Fujian Branch Secretariat’s Vice Minister Wei Tianyou forced him north to the capital. There, Fangde inquired after the whereabouts of Empress Dowager Xie and the former Emperor Ying, prostrating himself in grief. Soon after, he fell ill. Mengyan sent a physician with medicine mixed into rice, urging him to take it. Fangde grew furious: “I wish to die—do you seek to keep me alive?” He cast it to the ground and starved himself to death.

Lady Li was beautiful and wise, well-versed in the *Nü Xun* and other texts. When Fangde’s forces were defeated and he fled into Fujian, Military Commissioner Wu, fearing he might incite rebellion, offered a reward for his capture. Lady Li hid in the mountains of Guixi with her two sons, living on wild plants. In the fourteenth year of the Zhiyuan era, Xinzhou troops tracked them to the mountains. The order was given: “If Lady Li is not captured, slaughter the people and raze the land.” Upon hearing this, she said: “How can I bring ruin upon others for my sake? I will surrender to spare them.” And so she was taken.

**Record:** The histories praise Fangde for preserving his integrity through hardship—how tragic, the difficulty of keeping one’s virtue whole! Though he knew he could not accept the summons and twice refused with resolve, how could he have known he would still face the duty of friendship? As Zhang Zihui’s poem says:
*“This journey, I rely on my three-inch tongue;
Returning, I’ll not be worth a single coin.”*
Alas!

This reveals how the noble person aids others in achieving goodness and refrains from aiding their evil, for the treasures of the world are indeed to be cherished by all under heaven.

*The History of the Yuan* records: Yu Que’s wife was Jiang, and his concubines were Yebo and Yelü. Que defended the isolated city for six years, surrounded by bandits, yet stood resolute within—shield of Jianghuai. When Chen Youliang, Zhao Pusheng, and others joined forces to attack, they swarmed the city from all sides. With no external reinforcements and strength exhausted, the city fell. Que drew his blade and took his own life. Jiang and his concubines, leading his daughter An’an, threw themselves into a well and died. His eldest son, Dezheng, aged eighteen, wailed: “My father died in loyalty—how can I live?” He drowned himself in the pond of the rear garden. His nephew, Futong, a skilled and valiant warrior, also perished in the city moat. His nephew-in-law, Hua Li, commander of the righteous troops, and his entire family slit their own throats. The prefect, Han Jianfang, bedridden with illness, cursed the rebels and refused to yield; his whole household was slaughtered. At that time, the city’s able-bodied men all ascended the walls, casting aside their ranks and declaring: “We would rather die than surrender.” Over a thousand perished alongside them.

Que’s commands were strict yet trusted; he shared hardships with his subordinates. In battle, when arrows and stones rained down, soldiers shielded him, but he pushed them away, saying: “You, too, have lives—why shield me?” Thus, they fought all the more fiercely. In rare moments of respite, he gathered scholars to lecture, stationing soldiers outside the gates to listen, teaching them the duty of honoring the ruler and revering superiors. His devotion to the state was long established.

**Record:** The *Song Biography* names the concubine as Yebo, while *The History of the Yuan* calls her Yelü, and the *Account of Martyrs* records his wife as Jiang. The *Anqing Gazetteer*, citing Gongsun Zonglie, states: “The lord had concubines Yebo and Yelü; his true wife was Jiang. Wife and concubine—no difference in righteousness.” That a household should unite a loyal minister, a chaste wife, an extraordinary son, and a virtuous daughter is already remarkable. Yet even his nephew, son-in-law, warriors, foot soldiers, and the city’s able-bodied men all chose to die together—why? For the rise of the false Han was no just punitive campaign, and Yu Que’s pledge echoed the spirit of Suiyang. Heaven thus entrusted him with preserving integrity to illuminate great righteousness, then exposed the rebels’ villainy to reveal where the true mandate lay. To claim the Hu’s fortune was not yet spent would be a grave error.

The *Brief Account of Double Loyalty* in the *Imperial Ming Records* by Su Boheng states: Wang Zhiqing and Hu Shouzhen, sisters-in-law of the Qiantang commoner Hu Zongxin, were wife and elder sister to him. Zongxin was born as his parents passed, and his elder brothers soon followed. Young and frail, his sister feared he could not stand alone. She thought: “Whether I marry early or late, what difference does it make? If I stay to raise my young brother, even a late marriage would bring no shame.” She remained, managing the household. Before long, Zongxin also died, leaving a two-year-old son, Gongcai. His sister sighed: “Alas, I can never marry now. When my brother lived, I could not bear to leave him so young—now that he is gone, if I abandon his child, who will care for the orphan?” Zhiqing harbored no other intentions. The two wept facing each other, vowing to live and die together, sharing every waking and sleeping moment. Shouzhen treated Zhiqing as a sister-in-law, while Zhiqing served her with the devotion due to a mother-in-law. In poverty, they scraped by—opening their door to copy books for money, barely securing firewood and rice. Then they would shut the door to tend to women’s work: cold looms with twin shuttles, a single lamp burning past midnight. For nineteen years, they lived thus, never exchanging a harsh word.

When Shouzhen reached sixty and passed away, Zhiqing observed the three-year mourning rites with full propriety.

**Recorded Note:** Such was Deng Bodao’s devotion to righteousness.
**The Noble One says:** This was severed by Heaven.
Can Heaven truly sever?
For this nephew could not have survived alone.

Such was the deliverance of Lu Yigu from disaster.
**The Noble One says:** This was snatched by fortune.
Can fortune truly be seized?
For this child could not have been abandoned alone.

How much purer is she who remains chaste and unwed?
Chaste and unwed, she leaves nothing for Heaven to sever, nothing for fortune to snatch—her conduct is wholly righteous. This is the resolve of a common woman, which no other could wrest from her. Yet should the sages have cast aside the customs of village folk?

**From *Que Li Zhi*:**
Kongshi, styled Deqing, was the fifty-eighth-generation descendant of the Sage Confucius. The second daughter of Kong Zhi, a teacher in Suzhou, she was gifted with intelligence, skilled in women’s arts, and versed in all classics and histories. At eighteen, she married Wang Lun of Qufu. Upon entering his household, she was filial, respectful, and harmonious, earning praise from all relatives. After barely two years of marriage, she had no children when Lun fell gravely ill with an epidemic. He said to her: “I do not regret dying, but for your youth and lack of support—my eyes will not close in the underworld.”
Kongshi replied: “In life, we shared a chamber; in death, we shall share a grave. Do not resent me—I will not fail you.”
Lun then died. Kongshi collapsed in grief, fainting dead away. Reviving, she immediately hanged herself in Lun’s room. Her mother-in-law, who doted on her, rushed to save her, weeping: “My child’s death is already unbearable—why add to my sorrow by not considering my old age?”
Kongshi choked out: “I have already pledged my word—how can I break it?”
Her mother-in-law ordered the household to guard her closely, and Kongshi’s plans came to naught. They consoled her in every way, offering food and drink as usual. When the day of Lun’s burial arrived, the household assumed her resolve had softened and ceased their vigil. The next morning, as the funeral procession was to depart, Kongshi hanged herself in her chamber. By dawn, when each servant was occupied with their duties, her mother-in-law, surprised by her absence, called for her—only to find she was gone. She was buried alongside Lun. She was twenty years old, on the eleventh day of the seventh lunar month in the autumn of the *guisi* year of the Chenghua reign.

**Recorded Note:** Yao and Shun perfected human relationships; Confucius established the standards of ritual—both began and completed their paths. Thus is this recorded.

*Hong Dao Lu*, Scroll Twenty-Two, concludes.

**#1** *Note:* The character 毋 was originally written as 母; amended here according to context.

**Hong Dao Lu, Scroll Twenty-Three: On Righteousness**

**On the Righteousness of Brothers**

Wan Zhang asked: "May I inquire—some say 'banishment.' What does this mean?"

The Master replied: "Xiang was not permitted to act within his state. The Son of Heaven dispatched officials to govern his state and collect its tribute and taxes. Thus, it was called 'banishment.' How could he have oppressed those people?"

**Recorded Note:** In my foolish view, Xiang’s misconduct was not so severe as that of later ages. When Guan and Cai were set to oversee Yin, when Cao Shen served as minister of Qi, when Jia Yi governed Liang, and when Master Dong administered Jiangdu—did the Son of Heaven not likewise send officials to govern their states? Yet few refrained from tyranny. From this, we may see that Xiang’s desires lay only in wealth and rank; once he received tribute, he was content. The desires of later ages, however, centered on oppression—rejecting restraint, indulging in might, and growing ever more excessive. Even with the utmost benevolence and consummate righteousness of a Great Shun, how could one have dealt with them well?

Tai Kang occupied the throne in idleness and pleasure, extinguishing his virtue. The common people grew disloyal. He then roamed without restraint, hunting beyond the Luo River for a hundred days without returning. Hou Yi of Youqiong, seizing the people’s suffering, barred him at the Yellow River. Tai Kang’s five younger brothers escorted their mother in pursuit, all reaching the banks of the Luo. The five sons, filled with resentment, recited the admonitions of Great Yu and composed songs.

The first song said:
*"Our august ancestor left teachings:
The people may be drawn near, but not looked down upon.
The people are the state’s root; when the root is firm, the state is at peace.
I regard the world—
Even the humblest man or woman surpasses me in one thing.
A single ruler’s three failures—
Resentment need not be open to be plotted against.
I govern the multitudes,
Trembling as if driving six horses with rotten reins.
How can one who stands above others not be reverent?"*

The second song said:
*"The teachings declare:
Within, indulgence in beauty; without, obsession with hunting.
Sweet wine and fondness for music, towering halls and carved walls—
If any of these exist, none have not perished."*

The third song said:
*"Once, in the time of Yao of Tao Tang,
This northern land flourished.
Now, having lost the Way,
Its order is in chaos—
Thus it reaches ruin."*

The fourth song said:
*"Bright was our ancestor,
Lord of ten thousand states.
He had canons and standards,
Bequeathing them to his descendants.
Weights balanced, measures harmonized—
The royal treasury held them.
Now, his legacy is abandoned,
His lineage overthrown, his sacrifices cut off."*

The fifth song said:
*"Alas, where shall I return?
My heart is filled with sorrow.
The myriad people despise me—
To whom shall I turn?
My heart aches like clay,
My face burns with shame.
Had he guarded his virtue,
Even regret might have been redeemed."*

**Recorded Note:** Examining these five songs, their intent is earnest, their emotion mournful, their words veiled yet unmistakable—truly, they speak with weeping and tears. When Yi fled Yu’s son to the northern slopes of Mount Ji, the people of the world said, "He is our lord’s son." There was no other reason: Qi was worthy and reverent. When Yi barred Qi’s son north of the great river, the five sons’ song said, "The myriad people despise me." There was no other reason: he had not guarded his virtue. Though his fate was self-inflicted, it was indeed Yi’s doing. Had there been a Yi Yin of Yin, how could he not have acted as he did with Tai Jia of Xia? Why bar him at all?

Above, there was the legacy of Great Yu and Qi; within, the five sons and their mother’s virtue. Yi’s schemes, though not yet fully executed, were already unshakable. Thus it is said: *"Resentment need not be open to be plotted against."* Alas! When six horses bolt, the state’s root is lost; when beauty and hunting lead to indulgence, the nation’s ruin follows. Even after a thousand ages, who does not sigh deeply at this? What heart could remain unmoved? What heart?

The Viscount of Wei said: *"Father Preceptor, Junior Preceptor—
Yin’s governance is no longer upright in the four quarters.
Our ancestors’ achievements are laid bare above.
I have drowned in drunkenness,
Corrupting my virtue below.
In Yin, none—great or small—do not delight in theft and villainy.
The ministers and officials all transgress the measure;
For every crime, there is no constant punishment.
The common people rise up,
Mutually hostile and vigilant.
Now Yin is sinking—
Like fording great waters, without shore or bank.
Yin’s ruin has come to this day."*

He said: *"Father Preceptor, Junior Preceptor,
I shall go mad and flee.
Our house, in its senility, retreats into wilderness.
Now you stand at the precipice—
What is to be done?"*

The Father Preceptor said: *"Prince,
Heaven has sent down poisonous calamity to ruin the state of Yin.
Now, they indulge in drunkenness,
Without fear or reverence.
They cast aside the elders,
The old and those of rank.
Now, the people of Yin
Steal the sacrificial animals of gods and spirits,
Using them for their own indulgence.
They eat without disaster,
And Heaven watches over the people of Yin.
They levy warnings and exactions,
Summoning enemies without end.
Their crimes converge as one—
Many suffer, yet none are admonished.
Shang is now beset by calamity;
I shall bear its ruin.
If Shang perishes,
I shall not serve as a slave.
I urge the prince to depart and follow the Way.
The prince does not go.
I stand at the precipice—
I shall act on my own,
Offering myself to the former kings.
I shall not look back or proceed further."*

**Recorded Note:** Carefully considering this text—where it says, *"Now you have no recourse; you stand at the precipice—what is to be done?"*—the Viscount of Wei sought to discern the moment of decision. Where it says, *"I urge the prince to depart and follow the Way; the prince does not go; I stand at the precipice,"*—Jizi explained the principle of departure. These two passages form the essence of the text. Where it says, *"I shall act on my own, offering myself to the former kings; I shall not look back or proceed further,"*—Jizi spoke of his own duty, not that the Viscount of Wei should preserve the ancestral sacrifices to offer to the former kings. Bigan acted on his own by dying in remonstrance to offer himself to the former kings; Jizi acted on his own by feigning madness to offer himself to the former kings. For Jizi was a paternal uncle of Zhou, the elder of Yin’s lineage, entrusted by the former kings. The Viscount of Wei, as Zhou’s elder half-brother, was Yin’s heir, relied upon by Emperor Yi.

Should the ancestral state face calamity and disorder, yet its lineage elder depart, to whom would the former kings turn their hopes? If the heir apparent were also lost, and the eldest successor remained without departing, where would the ancestral sacrifices endure? This is why Jizi acted on his own, offering himself to the former kings, without regard for flight or pursuit.

Bigan, though also a paternal uncle of Zhou, was not the eldest compared to Jizi; nor was he the heir, unlike the Viscount of Wei. If death was to be his fate, he would die—what further deliberation before the former kings could there be? The *Collected Commentaries* question why Bigan alone left no words, to which Kong [Anguo] replied that their hearts were aligned, and thus no repetition was needed. Alas, were these truly his words?

The Duke of Zhou said: *"Lord Shi, it is most unpropitious. Heaven has sent ruin upon Yin, and Yin has lost its mandate. Our Zhou has received it, yet I dare not say: ‘Its foundation shall forever be blessed.’ If Heaven’s aid is steadfast, I dare not claim its end will be inauspicious. Alas, my lord! I say: ‘In this time, I too dare not rest secure in the Mandate of Heaven. I shall not cease to reverently ponder Heaven’s majesty, nor shall I allow my people to stray or transgress. My descendants, my sons and grandsons, must not fail in reverence toward above and below, nor obstruct the radiance of those who came before. Now, I, the young one Dan, am not capable of rectitude, yet I strive to extend the light of those who came before, bestowing it upon my youthful heir.’"*

The Duke said: *"Lord Shi, may Heaven grant you long life and peace, preserving the remnant of Yin. If Yin’s successors perish, Heaven’s majesty will be extinguished. Now, if you ever remember this, your mandate shall be firm, and your governance shall clearly manifest our state’s founding. Now, I, the young one Dan, am like one crossing a great river—I go forth to assist you, Lord Shi. May we succeed together! Alas, let us both devote ourselves to this task. We have striven to this day for prosperity, and together we perfect King Wen’s work without cease, so that from the seas’ edges to where the sun rises, none shall not be led to compliance."*

It is recorded: *"Whenever I read the writings of Lord Shi, I cannot but rise and sigh thrice. Though the Duke of Shao was his younger brother, he addressed him as ‘Lord Shi.’ Though the Duke of Zhou was his elder brother, he called himself ‘the young one.’ Though both dukes were aged, their reverence never waned—one sees therein the utmost sincerity of their devotion. The Duke of Zhou remained to assist the king, while the Duke of Shao retired in old age, yet neither harbored the slightest selfish intent. Thus, in their regard for their lord, they were humble and could not but be mindful; in their stewardship of their legacy, they were diligent and could not but be thorough; in their reverence for Heaven, they were profound and could not but be sincere; in their grasp of the Mandate, they were awe-inspired and could not but be steadfast. If even in old age they did not slacken, how much less should one in the prime of life?*

*In the reign of Emperor Zhezong of Song, Lord Guang served as chief minister, upholding the great principles of governance; Lord Chunren served as minister, and Empress Dowager Xuanren as regent. Yet with a single decree, all was cast aside—down to the appointments of Zeng Dun and Cai Bian—plunging the realm into chaos, toppling the Song’s legacy, and forfeiting Heaven’s Mandate. Today, those who read of this weep, yet how few are those who read the *Book of Lord Shi* without deepening their sighs!*

*The Charge to Cai Zhong* states: *"It was the Duke of Zhou who, as Grand Steward, rectified the hundred officials. After quelling the slander of the Three Guards, he exiled Guan Shu to Shang, imprisoned Cai Shu in Guolin with seven chariots, and demoted Huo Shu to commoner status, barring him from court for three years. When Cai Zhong proved himself capable and reverent in virtue, the Duke of Zhou made him a minister. After Cai Shu’s death, he commanded that a state be established for him in the eastern lands. The king spoke thus: ‘Young one Hu, only by following virtue and amending your conduct, by prudently considering your path, shall I invest you as a lord in the eastern lands. Go to your fief and be reverent! You must cover the faults of those who came before you. Be loyal and filial, and you shall draw near to yourself. Be diligent without cease, and you shall leave an example for your descendants. Follow the constant teachings of your ancestor King Wen, and do not emulate your father’s defiance of the royal command. August Heaven has no favorites—it aids only those who possess virtue. The hearts of the people are not constant—they cherish only those who show them kindness. Though the paths of goodness differ, they all lead to order. Though the paths of evil differ, they all lead to chaos. Take heed! Consider both your beginnings and your ends, and your end shall not be beset by hardship. If you neglect your end, it shall end in ruin. Strive in your endeavors, harmonize with your four neighbors, and thus strengthen the royal house and reconcile with your brothers. Bring peace and succor to the common folk, govern from the center, and do not employ cleverness to disrupt ancient statutes. Examine carefully what you see and hear, and do not alter your course on account of slanderous words. Then I, the One Man, shall praise you.’"*

The Record states: When the Duke of Zhou enfeoffed Cai Zhong, how could it compare to Ji You’s preservation of Qing Fu’s lineage? Slander was refuted and silenced at the lips, yet error, compounded by coercion from Guan, led to his imprisonment. Imprisoned—could his sacrifices truly be severed? Not only did the Duke not bear past grievances in mind, but he further appointed him as minister. The Duke’s heart was as vast as heaven and earth, as luminous as sun and moon. This is why, before the morning clouds dispersed, all under heaven became clear and bright.

From the *Zuo Tradition*: Duke Zhuang of Lu had no proper heir. While constructing a terrace overlooking the Dang clan, he saw Meng Ren and followed her, begetting a son, Ban. Wishing to enthrone him out of favor, he consulted Shu Ya. Shu Ya said, "Alternating succession is Lu’s constant practice. With Qing Fu alive, what cause for concern have you?" He then consulted Ji You, who replied, "I shall, even unto death, uphold Ban." The Duke asked, "What of Shu Ya?" Cheng Ji, by the Duke’s command, ordered Xi Shu to await at the home of Jian Wu, where he made Jian Ji drink poison, saying, "Drink this, and you shall have descendants in the state of Lu. Refuse, and you shall die without posterity." He drank, returned home, and died at Kui Spring. His son was established as the Shusun clan. When the Duke passed, Ji You enthroned Ban. Qing Fu sent assassins to kill Ban and enthroned Kai of the Dang clan, who became Duke Min. Fan Jiang conspired with Qing Fu to murder Duke Min and enthrone Qing Fu. Qing Fu dispatched Bu Qi to assassinate the Duke at Wuwei. Cheng Ji, with Duke Min’s elder brother Shen residing in Lin, and the people of Lu unwilling to accept Qing Fu, Qing Fu fled in fear to Ju. Ji You entered and enthroned Shen, who became Duke Xi. He sought Qing Fu in Ju with bribes, and the people of Ju returned him. Upon reaching Mi, when Gongzi Yu pleaded, Qing Fu refused. Yu wept as he departed. Qing Fu asked, "Whose voice is this?" and hanged himself. His descendants became the Meng clan.

The Record states: Observing Ji You’s deeds, one sees that though he overcame peril and achieved minor success, he failed to grasp the greater principle. Duke Ding of Lin said, "When a minister murders his lord, all officials involved shall be killed without pardon. Slay the perpetrator, destroy his house, raze his office, and stain the ground with red earth." Lin was a small state, yet it could adjudicate such a case—how could a great state remain ignorant of this? With this principle unclarified, further murders followed. In the matter of Shi Zhi, how could one not foresee the succession of disasters? Thus, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* records Qing Fu’s flight into exile without clarifying his death—the intent of the Sage is evident.

Duke Gong of Song sent Duke Wen of Zhu to sacrifice Zheng Zi at the altar of Ci Sui, intending to bind the Eastern Yi. Marshal Zi Yu said, "In ancient times, the six livestock were not used interchangeably. Minor affairs did not employ great sacrifices—how much less dare one use a human? Sacrifices are for the sake of humanity, for the people are the hosts of the spirits. Who would accept such an offering?" Duke Huan of Qi preserved three dying states and bound them to the feudal lords. Even righteous scholars called this "meager virtue." Now, in a single assembly, you brutalize the lords of two states and offer them to licentious and deluded ghosts. How can you seek hegemony thus? To die without disgrace would be fortunate. When the Song army besieged Cao, Zi Yu said to Duke Gong, "King Wen, hearing of Chong’s disorder, attacked it. After thirty days, it did not surrender. He withdrew to cultivate virtue, then attacked again, and it surrendered at once. The *Odes* say: 'He models himself for his wife, extends it to his brothers, and thus governs his state and domain.' Now, if your virtue is perhaps still lacking, how can you attack others? Why not first reflect inwardly on your virtue, ensuring no deficiency before acting?"

The Record states: The *Spring and Autumn Annals* criticizes hereditary ministers. Zi Yu, as hereditary Left Marshal, was no minor figure. The Shang ancestors could not bear to ensnare flying birds, yet now humans are used in place of livestock. In great droughts, the people long for clouds and rain, yet now they are coerced by force. Confucius reproached Zai Wo for his words that made the people tremble, while Boyi assisted Yu in furthering civilizing virtue. Zi Yu’s admonitions—are they not the legacy of sages and worthies? Alas, they were not heeded.

In the seventeenth year of Duke Xuan’s reign, in winter, the eleventh month, on the day *renwu*, the Duke’s younger brother, Shu Pan, died. The text reads: "The Duke’s younger brother"—why is he deemed worthy? If he is deemed worthy, for what reason? He condemned the regicide yet did not depart. One asks: "He was his brother—where could he go?" If offered wealth, he would say, "I have enough." He wove sandals to sustain himself and never consumed Duke Xuan’s food. The noble person deems this a reconciliation of kinship, and thus the *Spring and Autumn Annals* honors him.

The Record states: Was Shu Ao not truly an incorruptible scholar? Xiang Zhong’s regicide and Duke Xuan’s usurpation were enmities not to be borne under the same sky. Had Pan possessed Ji You’s authority, he could have deposed Ya and enthroned Min, or executed Meng and served Xi. Yet lacking such power, he merely clung to fraternal bonds, serving as an instrument for his enemy—nothing more than trampling and cutting down. What did the Sage find worthy in him? He took what was not rightfully his and refused to eat. Without the pretext of avoiding his brother or forsaking his mother, and enjoying surplus wealth and honor, Pan surpassed others by several degrees. How could he compare to Zhongzi of Yu Ling?

Cao Zizang, named Xin Shi, was a son of Duke Xuan. When Duke Xuan joined Jin in attacking Qin, he died in the campaign. The people of Cao sent Gongzi Fu Chu to guard the state and Zizang to receive the Duke’s funeral. Fu Chu killed the crown prince and enthroned himself as Duke Cheng. The feudal lords all requested to punish him. Zizang, deeming Duke Cheng unrighteous, prepared to flee. When the people heard this, they followed Zizang in droves. Duke Cheng, alarmed, confessed his crime and begged to remain. Thereupon, Zizang returned and relinquished his fief.

The following year, Duke Cheng met with the feudal lords at Qi, where the Marquis of Jin seized him and sent him to Zhou. All the feudal lords admired Zizang and intended to meet him in Zhou to enthrone him. Zizang declined, saying: "An ancient saying goes: The sage adapts to circumstance, the next best holds to it, and the lowest loses it. To be a ruler is not within my station. Though I may not be a sage, how dare I fail to uphold what is proper?" Thereupon, he fled to Song. Three years later, the people of Cao petitioned Jin, and the Marquis of Jin told them: "If Zizang returns, I shall restore your lord." Zizang had no choice but to return to Cao to await Jin’s decree. Later, the people of Jin again petitioned Zhou to reinstate Duke Cheng. Zizang then relinquished all his lands and person, never again serving in office.

The record states: What is called *jie* (节, integrity) is to restrain things once they have gone astray. *Jie* is the means to order the vast. Thus, its image says: "Not stepping beyond the courtyard gate, one knows what is open and what is blocked." Fu Chu’s crime reached heaven above, severed human bonds below, and abandoned the covenant of allies—unlike the case of Duke Xuan’s assassination and succession, where the people of Cao harbored no dissent and the feudal lords voiced no objection. At that time, why did none consider the people’s unity and the lords’ shared condemnation, petitioning the Son of Heaven to avenge the crown prince’s wrong? Had they rightly enforced official punishment, the fallen moral order would have been restored, and heaven and earth, darkened, would have shone anew. Could this not be called *jie*? Ignorant of this principle, they clung to petty fidelity, enabling a great evil to surge forth. Thus, the mandate of heaven, nearly extended, was withdrawn; human desires, once unleashed, became irrepressible. Thereafter, traitors and usurpers followed in succession. Mencius did not say in vain: "Though Zhongzi were unrighteous, if offered the state of Qi, he would not accept." All believed him—this was the principle of refusing meat and bean broth. Alas, none at the time reproached Zizang with this truth.

Jizha was the youngest son of King Shoumeng of Wu. Shoumeng had four sons: the eldest, Zhufan; the second, Yuzhai; the third, Yumei; and the youngest, Jizha. Jizha was virtuous, and Shoumeng wished to enthrone him. Jizha declined, so Shoumeng installed Zhufan as regent to manage state affairs. After Zhufan completed the mourning rites, he offered the throne to Jizha in accordance with their father’s command. Jizha refused, saying: "When Duke Xuan of Cao died, the feudal lords and the people of Cao deemed it unrighteous, and Cao’s lord sought to enthrone Zizang. Zizang departed to preserve the lord’s legitimacy. The noble man said: ‘He was able to uphold integrity.’ You, my lord, are the rightful heir. Who would dare contest your rule? To hold the state is not within my station." Though unworthy, he wished to emulate Zizang’s integrity. The people of Wu insisted on enthroning Jizha, but he abandoned his home to till the fields, and they desisted. When Zhufan died, he passed the throne to his brother Yuzhai, intending to transmit it in turn until it reached Jizha, fulfilling their father’s wish. Seventeen years later, Yuzhai died, and his brother Yumei succeeded him. When Yumei died, they again sought to offer the throne to Jizha, but he fled. The people of Wu then enthroned Yumei’s son, Liao.

Zhufan’s son, Guang, thought: "My father transmitted the throne through his brothers in order to ultimately bestow it upon Jizi. Though Jizi refuses the state, I should rightfully succeed." He then sent an assassin to kill Liao and usurped the throne, becoming Helü. Jizha, returning from Jin, said: "If the ancestral sacrifices of our former lord remain unbroken, the people have a lord, the altars are served, and the state stands firm, then he is my lord. Whom should I resent? For one day to die for duty is to await heaven’s decree—it is not I who stirs rebellion. He who is enthroned follows the way of our forebears." He returned, mourned at the ancestral tomb, and resumed his former position.

The record states: Jizha’s refusal of the state cannot be compared to Cao Zizang’s. Zhufan harbored no usurping intent; his transmission of the throne honored his father’s command. Thus, Jizha said: "You, my lord, are the rightful heir. Who would dare contest you?" This was to value the bonds of heaven. The succession passed to Yuzhai, then Yumei, then Jizha—who could say it was wrong? Yet King Liao did not act thus. That Guang usurped the throne was Liao’s doing, but the ministers and people of Wu were not without blame. Some attribute it to Jizha’s refusal and abdication, but this is mistaken. Shoumeng’s desire to transmit the throne to Jizha was not like the perfect virtue of Zhou. Shoumeng, having usurped the title of king, sought to emulate the deeds of King Ji and King Wen. This was what Jizha deeply feared. His intentions were subtle and concealed, unknown to others, but Jizha alone understood—how could he not repeatedly evade the throne? Our Master Confucius especially esteemed Jizha, though his meaning remained unspoken, precisely for this reason. When Jizha died, Confucius inscribed his tomb: "Alas! This is the grave of Jizi of Yanling." His intent was just so.

The Marquis of Xing of Jin disputed the fields of Hao with Yongzi, but the case dragged on without resolution. When Shi Jingbo traveled to Chu, Shuyu acted as interim judge, and Han Xuanzi ordered him to adjudicate old cases. The fault lay with Yongzi, who offered his daughter to Shuyu. Shuyu perverted justice and condemned the Marquis of Xing. Enraged, the marquis killed Shuyu and Yongzi in court. Xuanzi inquired about their punishment from Shuxiang. Shuxiang said: "All three share the same guilt. Execute the living and expose the dead." Yongzi, knowing his guilt, bribed to buy a verdict—this was the corruption of King Zhou. The Marquis of Xing took the law into his own hands. Thus, Xuanzi executed the marquis and exposed the corpses of Yongzi and Shuyu in the marketplace. Confucius said: "Shuxiang was a remnant of ancient integrity. In meting out punishment, he did not shield his kin. Though he enumerated Shuyu’s crimes, he did not flatter him. Such was his righteousness."

The record states: Formerly, when Shuxiang mourned his mother, she said: "I fear he will give birth to dragons and serpents." She also said: "Wolf cubs have wild hearts—what misfortune for the Yangshe clan!"

If only for wolves does one demand accountability, if only for serpents does one feel alarm—yet still, none admonished their licentiousness. By the time disaster befell Yongzi, all three transgressions were complete. Even had he wished to cry out against evil, who would have heeded his cry?

*The Former Han History* records: Liu Zhang, the Marquis of Zhuxu, resented the Lü clan’s usurpation of power and the Liu house’s exclusion from office. Once, attending a banquet, Zhang requested: “I am a general of the ranks—let me enforce military discipline in governing the wine.” When one of the Lü men, drunk, fled the feast, Zhang drew his sword and pursued, slaying him. As the Empress Dowager had already granted him military authority, there was no ground to punish him. Thereafter, the Lü clan feared the Marquis of Zhuxu, and the Liu house grew stronger.

The record states: King Wu of Wei exterminated the entire Tang royal line, yet Empress Lü spared the Marquis of Zhuxu because Qi stood as his shield. Thus, the Lü clan may well be called devoid of strategy. They relied on kinship through women, unaware that such kinship was not founded on womanhood; they trusted in the strength of Lü arms, unaware that such strength was not rooted in arms. Therefore, armies may be seized, but Zhang’s resolve could not be seized; forces may be relied upon, but Ying’s schemes could not be relied upon. By this point, the Lü clan had no strategy left.

*The Later Han History* recounts: As the renown of Guangwu and his elder brother Liu Yan grew, the generals of the Xinshi and Pinglin factions secretly urged Gengshi to eliminate them. Just then, Liu Ji, a subordinate commander, heard of Gengshi’s enthronement and raged: “The original architects of this great enterprise were the Bo Sheng brothers—what is Gengshi’s role?” He was arrested and sentenced to execution. Yan vehemently protested, whereupon Li Yi and Zhu Jiu urged Gengshi to seize Yan as well, and he was killed that very day. When officials came to offer condolences to Liu Xiu, he refused private conversation, maintaining only strict avoidance. He dared not wear mourning for Yan, and whenever alone, he abstained from wine and meat, his mat and pillow bearing traces of tears. Only his secretary Feng Yi sought to console him, but Xiu silenced him: “Do not speak recklessly.” Yi then advised: “Gengshi’s governance is in chaos, and the people have no one to rely upon. A starving man is easily sated—now that you command an entire region, you should dispatch officials to tour the commanderies and counties, proclaiming virtue and grace.” Xiu deeply accepted his counsel.

Lu states: The first six in *Kan* (坎) reads: "Repeated peril—entering the peril brings harm; inauspicious." The *Xiang* commentary says: "Repeated peril, entering peril—losing the Dao brings misfortune." Yan, fond of chivalry and reckless action, lived in an age of banditry and plunder—this was his "repeated peril." Though his uncle shared the same banner as Gaozu, his yielding nature remained unformed, and above him he found no support. How could he have rescued Bosheng from danger? His death was thus foreordained.

Yet the oracle’s root says: "In peril there is sincerity; only the heart is free—action brings esteem." Xiu possessed a firm and balanced talent, while Yi served as his steadfast and profound counsel. Esteeming their past achievements, Yi’s words found easy entry, and Xiu’s deep acceptance was likewise fitting. This is how they traversed peril without losing trust, and in the end, their loyal hearts proved their allegiance, their great merits honored—was this not the freedom of the steadfast heart?

Liu Yu was a great-great-grandson of Emperor Xuan. Emperor Xuan enfeoffed his son Xiao as Prince of Chu; Xiao begot Prince Si, who begot Prince Yu, who begot Ban. From Xiao to Ban, each generation accumulated benevolence and righteousness, their names and integrity renowned, but Yu was especially kind and sincere. Having lost his mother early, his younger brother, the Marquis of Yuanxiang, was still a child, so Yu personally raised him, sharing his bed, meals, and daily life. Even when the boy came of age, Yu never left his side. When Ping died of illness, Yu wept until he vomited blood, and within months, he too passed away.

Later, Emperor Guangwu enfeoffed Ban as Marquis of Leiqiu to continue the sacrifices to Prince Xiao. Emperor Ming summoned him as Commandant of the Capital and concurrently Colonel of the Garrison Cavalry; Emperor Zhang appointed him Chamberlain for the Palace Revenues and Minister of the Imperial Clan. While in office, Ban frequently spoke on governance, and his care for the nine clans, his conduct of righteousness, became especially renowned—his contemporaries praised him.

Lu states: At that time, the court was vigorously promoting the practice of modesty and deference, and the bonds of fraternal love extended from the imperial lineage to all under heaven. If one did not become a man of virtue, how could one escape the gaze of others? The days of the "peck of grain, bolt of silk" ballads were long past. Thus, this is recorded.

Du Lin and his younger brother Cheng were both devoted scholars, broadly learned and widely informed—contemporaries called them "erudite Confucians." At the end of Wang Mang’s reign, when bandits arose, they sojourned in Hexi. Yin Xiao, hearing of Lin’s integrity, deeply respected and treated him well, appointing him Keeper of the Archives. Later, Lin fell ill and requested leave, resigning his salary. Xiao wished to compel him to return, but Lin claimed grave illness. Though Xiao longed for his presence, he prioritized leniency and issued an edict: "Du Bolin cannot be a subject to the Son of Heaven, nor a friend to the feudal lords. Like Boyi and Shuqi, who were ashamed to eat Zhou grain, let him now hold the position of teacher and friend. We await the opening of the Dao so he may follow his aspirations."

Though Lin was constrained by Xiao, he never compromised his principles. When Cheng later died, Xiao permitted Lin to return with his brother’s coffin. Yet after sending him off, Xiao regretted it and dispatched the assassin Yang Xian to intercept him on the road. Seeing Lin personally pushing a deer cart bearing his brother’s coffin, Xian sighed: "In this age, who still practices righteousness? Though I am but a petty man, how could I bear to kill a man of virtue?" He then fled.

Emperor Guangwu, having heard of Du Lin’s reputation, summoned him and appointed him as Imperial Censor. After an audience, the emperor questioned him on classical texts, past affairs, and matters of the Western Regions, and was greatly pleased. Later, when the Crown Prince Jiang petitioned to be enfeoffed as Prince of Donghai, a new selection of officials was made for his household, and Lin was appointed as the prince’s tutor. He received special rewards and gifts. Eventually, Lin rose to the position of Grand Minister of Works, where he was praised for his competence in office.

The brothers Zhao Xiao and Zhao Li were known for their reverence, modesty, and steadfast conduct. During the chaos of the world’s upheaval, when people resorted to cannibalism, Li was captured by bandits who intended to cook him. Xiao then bound himself and presented himself to the bandits, offering to take his brother’s place in the pot. The bandits, astonished by this, spared them both. Their village admired their righteousness, and though the province repeatedly summoned them to office, they declined all appointments. During the Yongping era, Emperor Ming, having heard of their reputation, issued an edict appointing Xiao as Grand Master for Palace Counsel, later promoting him to Chamberlain for the Palace Garrison. He also summoned Li to serve as Palace Assistant Censor. Wishing to honor them, the emperor decreed that Li should visit the Chamberlain’s residence every ten days, where the Imperial Kitchen would provide feasts, allowing the brothers to dine together in joy. After several years, Li passed away, and the emperor ordered Xiao to accompany the funeral procession as an official escort. As Xiao had no sons, the emperor appointed Li’s two sons as Gentlemen of the Palace. The record states: I observe that Du Lin, initially caught in rebellion and pledging his life to Xiao, ultimately encountered a worthy man on the road due to banditry. As for the Zhao brothers, in that fleeting moment, could they have known they would rise to become a prince’s tutor, their rank elevated to that of a duke’s son, their meals distinct from those of common officials? Yang Xian’s righteousness and Xiao’s humility inspired their generation. Though such deeds are said to be what men believe in, they are truly what Heaven assists. Otherwise, would men like assassins or starving bandits willingly embrace righteousness? That they ultimately did not perish is indeed rare among their peers.

According to the *Book of Jin*: Right Vice Director Deng You was captured by Shi Le at the end of the Yongjia era. Crossing the Si River, You used oxen and horses to carry his wife and children forward. They again encountered bandits, who seized the livestock. Forced to proceed on foot, You carried his son and his nephew Sui, realizing he could not save both. He said to his wife, “My brother died young, leaving only this one descendant. By principle, he cannot be abandoned. We must leave our son behind.” His wife wept but complied, and they abandoned their child. In the end, You remained without an heir. The people, moved by his righteousness, mourned him, saying: “Heaven is blind—how could it leave Deng Boda without a brother?” Sui later served You’s mourning for one or two years. The record states: You’s grief is universally acknowledged across the ages. Yet history claims he preemptively bound his son to prevent escape—could this truly be the intent of a loving father and benevolent man? Do not say Heaven is blind, for it sees clearly. I believe neither account reflects the truth. When You was captured by Shi Le, he twice nearly died. By the time Le crossed the Si River, You had already smashed his cart and used oxen and horses to carry his family forward—yet pursuing soldiers were still searching for them. Judging by his intent, his son was older and more recognizable, so he bound him; his nephew was younger and less known, so he spared him. One was to delay the pursuers, the other to evade detection—not merely for righteousness. That he ultimately had no heir may have been fate, an unfortunate turn for a gentleman. To judge You by this would deter others from righteousness. This is the intent of this record.

Yu Gun was the great-uncle of Empress Mingmu, wife of Emperor Wu of Jin. From youth, he practiced diligence and frugality, devoted himself to learning, and was eager to seek knowledge. During the great epidemic of the Xianning era, his two elder brothers died, and his next brother, Pi, fell gravely ill. As the pestilential qi raged, his parents and younger brothers all fled outside, but Gun alone remained, personally tending to Pi day and night without rest. He continued to mourn and pay respects at the coffins without pause. After more than ten weeks, the epidemic subsided, his family returned, Pi recovered, and Gun remained unharmed. While Gun’s uncles and father all held prominent positions, his own father lived in humble poverty. Gun personally tilled the fields to provide for his parents, performing his duties with reverence. When planting hedges with his disciples, he would kneel to hand them the branches. Some asked, “Now that you live in seclusion, why such excessive respect?” He replied, “The principles of conduct differ in public and private—this is not the aspiration of a gentleman.” His wives all came from official families, yet upon marrying Gun, they abandoned luxury to endure hardship together. After his mother’s death, he observed mourning beside her grave. When someone cut down a tree near her tomb, he knelt, wept, and apologized: “My virtue is unrefined; I could not protect my ancestors’ trees.” The elders all wept in sympathy, and afterward, no one dared to harm the grave. The village, commandery, and province all recommended him as a Filial and Incorrupt Candidate of Exceptional Conduct, but he declined all honors, earning the title of “Man of Exceptional Conduct.”

When Qi King Tong advocated righteousness, Zhang Hong and others pillaged Yangdi. Gun then led his clansmen and commoners to take refuge on Mount Yu. Though the people lived in peace, they were unskilled in warfare or defense. Gun advised, “The ancients said: ‘A thousand men gathered without a leader will scatter or descend into chaos.’” The crowd replied, “If not you, then who should lead us?” He then made them swear: “Do not rely on terrain. Do not exploit disorder. Do not harm neighbors. Do not dismantle houses. Do not fell planted trees. Do not scheme against virtue. Do not violate righteousness. Exert your strength as one, and together we will overcome peril.” The people all obeyed. When bandits arrived, Gun organized his forces, arranged their ranks, and ordered them to draw their bows without releasing. The bandits, intimidated by their discipline and caution, retreated. The people remarked: “Only in bitter cold do we know the pine and cypress are the last to wither.” And: “He who fears in times of crisis and plans wisely will succeed—is this not Yu’s exceptional conduct?”

The record states: Observing the decadence of Jin’s customs, Yu Gun’s exceptional conduct shames not only the Eight Princes in life but also Pei Wei in death. Does it not also bring shame to Yuan Gui in life and mortify Shu Yu in death?

The disparity between recognizing the pine that stands firm in bitter cold from a single ailment and failing to discern the loyal minister amidst the turmoil of the Eight Princes—how vast as heaven and abyss! The contrast between the many who chase grandeur while one father alone upholds poverty, and those insatiable in desire and unbounded in demands—how utterly divergent! The difference between one who fears in times of crisis, plans wisely, and succeeds, and those who recklessly provoke disaster with shallow schemes—how stark as night and day! The distinction between one who remains steadfast in duty, diligent and reverent, whether in darkness or light, and those who harbor venom and act with violent impunity—how distant as north and south!

Thus we know: when demonic forces swarm, the yang virtue shines resplendent; when filth and corruption abound, luminous integrity stands pure. Without men like Shu Bao, how could Jin’s sun and moon endure?

*The History of the Southern Dynasties* records: Xie Hongwei, even as a young child, was composed and discerning. His uncle Xie Hun, upon seeing him, marveled and said, “This elder brother possesses profound innate acuity—he will surely become an exceptional vessel.” At the age of ten, Hongwei was adopted by his paternal uncle Xie Jun, brother of the Minister of Works Xie Ying, and thus became kin to Jun’s two sons. Though previously unacquainted, he conducted himself with natural propriety, aligning perfectly with ritual and sincerity.

At the beginning of the Yixi era, he inherited Jun’s title of Marquis of Jianchang. Hongwei’s family had long been poor and frugal, while his adoptive household was wealthy and prosperous. Yet he never took for himself any of the inherited wealth, stipends, or emoluments. Xie Hun, of lofty and austere character, had few close associates. He formed bonds only with his clansmen Xie Lingyun, Xie Zhan, Xie Yao, and Hongwei, gathering for literary and scholarly appreciation. They often dined and resided together in Wu Clothing Lane, hence their circle was known as the “Gathering of Wu Clothing.” Though others of high repute and renown existed, none dared approach their gate. Zhan and the others were rich in eloquence and rhetorical skill, but Hongwei always subdued them with his measured words. Hun held him in particular esteem, calling him “Weizi.”

Later, when Hun was executed for his association with Liu Yi’s faction, his wife, Princess Jinling, was ordered to sever ties with the Xie clan and remarry into the Wang family of Langye. Hun entrusted his household affairs to Hongwei. As a family of successive prime ministers, they held two enfeoffments, owned over ten estates, and commanded a thousand servants—yet had only two daughters. Hongwei managed their livelihood and affairs as if conducting public business: every coin and bolt of silk was recorded in ledgers. When Emperor Gaozu ascended the throne, he recognized the princess’s fidelity and allowed her to return to the Xie clan. From Hun’s death to her return, nine years had passed, yet the estate remained well-maintained, granaries full, and the household’s operations unchanged from former days. The fields were even more cultivated than before. The princess sighed, “The Minister always valued this child—he truly knew men. The Minister has not perished after all.”

Relatives by marriage, both secular and monastic, and old friends who witnessed the princess’s return entered the gate and could not help but sigh in admiration. Some wept, moved by Hongwei’s sense of duty.

The record states: Observing the Gathering of Wu Clothing Lane, one sees what was truly meant by “orchids and jade trees, radiant in their time.” There was Shu Yuan’s discernment, Kang Le’s literary brilliance, Xuan Yuan’s clarity and insight, and Xuan Ming’s outstanding talent—yet none met a natural end, save Weizi alone. Why was this? *The Book of Changes* in the *Hexagram of Minor Excess* says: “Failing to meet and exceeding—when the flying bird strays, it is ominous. This is called disaster and misfortune.” These men were not without talent or moral capacity, but they were all proud, impetuous, and reliant on their abilities, lacking steadfast integrity. They transgressed reason and overstepped bounds—hence their misfortune. Weizi, however, was stern and upright by nature, his conduct refined and restrained. In serving his adoptive family, he surpassed even his birth parents, acting with utmost sincerity and reverence. Inwardly, he communed with the divine; outwardly, he was cautious in speech and laughter, never compromising integrity or dignity. He seldom contended, yet was always upright—truly one whose conduct exceeded in reverence, whose mourning exceeded in grief, and whose frugality exceeded in thrift. Where could such a man not find his place?

*Hongdao Record, Scroll Twenty-Four: Righteousness* concludes.

**On Brotherly Righteousness**

From the *Old唐书*: Yu Shinan and his elder brother Shiji studied together under Yu Gu Yewang for over ten years, their concentrated thought unrelenting—sometimes going for months without washing or combing their hair. Their writings were graceful and refined, emulating the style of Minister Xu Ling. Xu himself believed their work resembled his own, and thus they gained renown. During the Tianjia era of the Chen dynasty, Emperor Wen, knowing the two brothers to be broadly learned, sent envoys to their home to protect and observe them. Shiji’s prose was clearer and more vigorous than Shinan’s, though not as richly abundant. Contemporaries compared them to the two Lu brothers of the Jin. During the Daye era, Shiji rose through the ranks to become Gentleman of the Secretariat. Under Emperor Yang of Sui, Shiji gained the emperor’s favor, attaining wealth and eminence; his wives and concubines, along with their attire and carriages, rivaled those of princes. Shinan, however, lived in humble austerity, never altering his conduct. When Yuwen Huaji killed Shiji, Shinan clung to him, wailing and pleading to die in his stead, but was unable to do so. From that time on, he grieved to the point of emaciation. Entering the Tang, he became a Scholar of the Hongwen Academy. Though already aged, he repeatedly petitioned to retire, but was not permitted. Emperor Taizong held him in high regard, for though his appearance was that of a frail scholar—seemingly too weak to bear his robes—his inner resolve was steadfast. In discussions, he upheld righteousness, and the emperor once remarked: “When I discuss ancient and modern affairs with Shinan, if he errs even in a single word, I cannot help but feel regret.” Such was his sincerity. The emperor also praised his five unparalleled virtues: moral conduct, loyalty and uprightness, broad learning, literary skill, and calligraphy. He died at the age of eighty-one.

**Record states:** Observing the two Yu brothers, one flourished in the Sui, the other rose in the Tang. The one who flourished in the Sui was like a spring flower in full bloom, dazzling for a time—thus the comparison to the two Lu brothers, for they were indeed both excellent. The one who rose in the Tang was like a late chrysanthemum holding its blossoms, its fragrance spreading in all directions—thus the world extolled his five unparalleled virtues, none surpassing him. Though their circumstances differed, their beginnings and ends were vastly distinct, as seen here. How then can one allow poverty or success, early or late, to divide one’s heart?

Cui Deng, styled Churen, had six brothers: Deng, Yan, Zou, Du, and E, all of whom simultaneously attained the rank of Third Grade. Among them, five served as Ministers of Rites and two as Ministers of Personnel—an unprecedented achievement since the founding of the Tang. Their father, Wu, maintained a household where four generations shared the same hearth, and contemporary families seeking to govern well all emulated their methods. Deng, known for his integrity and brightness, was esteemed by Emperor Xianzong and appointed Minister of Ceremonies. Upon assuming office, he conducted a grand review of the Four Departments of Music, drawing crowds of spectators from the capital. Deng personally escorted his mother’s carriage, leading his younger brothers, and when officials and nobles saw them, they yielded the road. The people of the capital honored them. Yan’s son, Guanglüe, possessed a majestic and handsome bearing, admired by all who saw him. His subordinates dared not deceive him, and whenever he appointed officials, he personally consulted the regulations, ensuring promotions and demotions were just. Even those from distant and humble backgrounds were never overlooked. He never hoarded wealth, but whenever he had any, he distributed it among his relatives and old friends. At home, he was cheerful, and his children and younger siblings followed his example. Du served as Left General of the Gold Bird Guard and died at home, having taken no part in Li Xun’s rebellion. People attributed this to the reward of accumulated goodness. E, as Acting Minister of the Right and Chief Councilor, governed Huainan. His residence was in Guangli Alley, where he built a study for convenience. Emperor Xuanzong, hearing of this, sighed and said: “The Zheng family’s filial piety and brotherly love serve as a model for scholar-official clans.” He then inscribed the name *Hall of Virtue’s Star*. Later, the capital’s Jingzhao Prefecture established a *Virtue’s Star* community in that neighborhood.

**Record states:** The Liu clan once said: “For those who walk the Way, virtue and learning are the roots, while uprightness and fortitude are the branches and leaves. With roots but no leaves, one may await the right time; with leaves but no roots, even nourishing rain cannot revive them. As for filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, and steadfast conduct—these are the ferment and sauce of life, how can one go a single day without them?” Observing the Cui family makes this clear. How can one neglect the standards of the world and become complacent, flaunting one’s successive displays of prosperity and indulging in wealth and rank? The inscription *Virtue’s Star* will surely not shine.

When Liu Gongchuo, Military Commissioner of Hexi, was among the most renowned of the ministers, he maintained strict family discipline. Outside the central gate of his residence stood a small study. Except on days when he attended court, he would emerge each dawn to enter this study. His sons, Zhong and Ying, all dressed in formal attire and paid their morning respects at the north side of the central gate. Gongchuo handled private matters, received guests, and dined with his younger brother Gongquan and their cousins. From dawn to dusk, he never left the study. When the lamps were lit, he would have his sons and younger brothers take up the classics and histories, reading them aloud once through. Afterward, they would discuss the principles of official conduct and household governance, or engage in literary discourse, or listen to the qin. Only when the night watch’s bell sounded would he return to his bedchamber. His sons would then perform the evening rites at the north side of the central gate. For over twenty years, this routine never varied for a single day.

In years of famine, his sons all ate only vegetables, and he would say: "Formerly, when my brothers and I served our late father as Prefect of Danzhou, he forbade us to eat meat on account of our unfinished studies. I dare not forget this."

When Gongchuo passed away, Zhong and Ying strictly adhered to his ways, serving Gongquan as they had served Gongchuo. Unless gravely ill, they never failed to wear their sashes in Gongquan’s presence. When Zhong served as Prefect of the Capital and Salt and Iron Commissioner, if he encountered Gongquan on the thoroughfare, he would dismount, stand upright in formal posture, and wait until Gongquan had passed before remounting. When Gongquan returned at dusk, they would don their sashes and greet him at the head of his horse. Though Gongquan repeatedly urged them to relax, Zhong and Ying never altered their conduct in the slightest, despite their official rank.

Gongchuo’s wife, née Han, was the great-granddaughter of the Chancellor Xiuzhi. Her family’s discipline was strict, frugal, and solemn, serving as a model for official households. After marrying into the Liu family, for three years she was never seen to smile in the presence of elders or juniors. She always wore plain silk, never brocade or embroidered silks. When returning to visit her parents, she did not ride in a gilded palanquin but only in a bamboo sedan chair, followed by two maidservants on foot. She often had pills made of bitter ginseng, coptis, and bear gall mixed with powder, which she distributed to her sons to hold in their mouths during long nights of study, to sustain their diligence.

A record states: The histories praise Gongchuo as benevolent yet courageous, and Zhong and Ying as upright, austere, and unadorned. Father and sons successively governed nine frontier commands, five times as Prefect of the Capital, and twice as Prefect of Henan. In none of these posts did they report auspicious omens, ordain monks or Daoists, or pardon corrupt officials. In administering their jurisdictions, they were urgent in aiding the poor and orphaned. At the first sign of flood or drought, they would lend grain in advance. Military provisions were always abundant, tax reductions and exemptions were granted, courier stations were well-supplied, and banquets for guests or rewards for troops were lavish. Yet when they handed over their posts, the granaries and treasuries were always fuller than when they had arrived. Such was their method of governance.

As for their personal cultivation and family discipline, the histories do not record these in full. Liu once wrote a book admonishing his descendants: "To ruin one’s reputation is to harm oneself; to disgrace one’s ancestors is to destroy one’s family." He listed five particularly grave faults, urging them to take heed:

First, seeking ease and comfort, disdaining frugality, pursuing personal gain without regard for others’ opinions;
Second, being ignorant of the Confucian arts, disliking the ancient Way, ashamed neither of one’s ignorance of the classics nor of one’s frivolous discourse on current affairs, resenting others’ learning while remaining oneself unlearned;
Third, resenting those superior to oneself while favoring flatterers, delighting only in idle chatter, neglecting the ancient Way, envying others’ virtues and broadcasting their faults, gradually sinking into depravity, eroding moral principles, while maintaining only the outward trappings of a gentleman—how does this differ from a menial servant?
Fourth, indulging in leisure and dissipation, addicted to wine and ruin, prizing drinking as refinement and dismissing diligence as vulgar, habits easily formed but difficult to correct;
Fifth, being desperate for official rank, currying favor with the powerful, gaining even a minor post through such means, only to incur the anger and suspicion of the multitude, with few escaping ruin.

I have observed that eminent families and great clans are all established through their ancestors’ loyalty, filial piety, diligence, and frugality, and are all destroyed by their descendants’ obstinacy, extravagance, and arrogance. Establishing a family is as difficult as ascending to heaven; destroying one is as easy as burning a hair. These words pierce the heart—you should engrave them in your bones.

A record states: The Liu family’s standards have endured for generations. Such admonitions as these apply to all, regardless of age or status. One should copy them and place them by one’s side. Do not dismiss them as trivial—no study is more essential.

The *History of the Song* records: When the Taizu Emperor visited Luoyang, Zhang Qixian, a commoner, presented a memorial outlining ten proposals, four of which pleased the emperor. On his return, the emperor told the Taizong Emperor: "During my visit to the western capital, I gained only one man—Zhang Qixian. I do not wish to appoint him to office; one day, he may serve as your chief minister." When the Taizong Emperor ascended the throne, he held an examination for scholars, and Qixian was among the selected. The examiners, however, failed to recognize his merit, and he was ranked among those who failed. The emperor was displeased and personally inscribed the entire list as having passed, granting them all official posts as *tongpan*. A record states: The Taizu Emperor’s recommendation of Qixian to serve as the Taizong Emperor’s chief minister was sincere and virtuous. At that time, the Taizong Emperor’s private ambitions had not yet arisen, and his original intentions remained intact. Thus, he granted the entire list of candidates the honor of passing—this was truly a radiant bestowal of favor. But when his private ambitions began to stir, Qixian was overlooked. Only after Zhao Pu recommended him a second time was he finally given high office. The emperor said: "If you advance Qixian, he will feel even greater gratitude than this." The emperor was greatly pleased. From this, it may be seen that Qixian was privy to the Prince of Qin’s schemes. Alas! Qixian betrayed the founding emperor.

How could one like Wang Pu, who vacillated between past and present regimes to ingratiate himself with the current court, be expected to render loyal and corrective service? The Chen family of Jiangzhou had a clan of seven hundred members. From Chen Chong onward, for several generations they never divided their household. They established family rules to admonish their descendants, selecting capable kinsmen to manage affairs, and built a school to instruct them. An imperial edict commended them as a "righteous household" and exempted them from corvée labor. Chong’s son Yibiao, and Yibiao’s son Fang, lived together without concubines or maidservants, and no one spoke out of turn. At mealtimes, the entire family gathered in the great hall, with those not yet grown seated separately. They built a library to host scholars from all directions, and the local customs were transformed. Fang’s nephew Hong, Hong’s younger brother Jing, and Jing’s descendants grew ever more numerous, often suffering from food shortages. During the Chunhua era, the Taizong Emperor ordered the local government to lend them two thousand *shi* of grain annually. Later, when Jing died, his cousin Xu accepted only half the grain, saying: "By economizing, we can last until the autumn harvest. This year’s poor harvest has driven up grain prices." Some urged Xu to accept the full amount, hoping to profit from the high prices, but Xu replied: "The court, seeing our large family’s hardship, lends us public grain. How can we see profit and forget righteousness?"

The Emperor, upon hearing this, deeply praised and commended him.

The record states: Jing’s relation to Xu was like that of the Emperor to Mei; Fang’s to Hong was like Mei’s to Zhao. Within one family, Chong served as its elder, Fang as its successor. Fang’s nephew was Hong, Hong’s younger brother was Jing, and Jing’s younger brother was Xu—across generations, they remained of one heart, never setting themselves apart. How could the laws of the state be inferior to the rules of a household, or a dying command less far-reaching than a bequeathed counsel? Examining this closely, its root lay in never contending for profit from grain. From a single mustard seed to ten thousand *zhong*, from a single chamber to the realm entire, why the ancients—sages and worthies—remained so vigilant and diligent, never daring to act with abandon, was precisely to cultivate this heart beforehand, lest they see profit and forget righteousness. Thus, in a mere Jiangzhou, there was the Chen family with seven hundred mouths, young and old; yet in the vast realm under heaven, there was not even one brother or two nephews like those of the Song. The Emperor’s praise for one man, while willingly bearing the censure of ten thousand generations, shows his failure to grasp the essence.

Ge Gong’s younger brother, Mi, was renowned for his Confucian learning and moral integrity across generations. During the Zhenzong Emperor’s reign, he presented *Ten Elegant Odes on Great Peace* and offered a *Eulogy for the Pavilion of Auspicious Omens*, which Yang Yi praised. Appointed magistrate of Nanchong, he was known for his benevolent governance and was promoted to governor of Nanjianzhou. The mountains and streams there abounded in copper and silver, and officials, exploiting deceit for profit, claimed the harvests were poor. Gong reformed the system, yielding an annual surplus of six million. The Minister of Revenue reported this to the court, deeming it worthy of reward, but Gong said: "How dare I claim credit for what heaven and earth produce?" He ultimately remained silent. Later, he was transferred to govern Xiuzhou. Xiuzhou lay between rivers and lakes, where officials had set up barriers along the waterways to levy tolls on travelers. Many with urgent wedding or funeral matters could not meet their deadlines, so Gong ordered all such tolls abolished. He died in office as Grand Master for Palace Attendants.

Gong was by nature kind and compassionate, recording the names of his clan and aiding widows and orphans—many owed their survival to him. While serving as judicial officer in Guangzhou, a powerful figure named Li Xin murdered someone and framed a local man, Ge Hua. Gong uncovered the truth and exonerated him. Though this act also merited reward, Gong reported it to the prefect and asked that no mention be made of it. He rose to the rank of Erudite of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, his nature ever serene and composed.

At fifty, he submitted a memorial to retire, but his relatives and in-laws all urged him to reconsider. He smiled and said: "If I wait until illness or old age forces me to die in office, how can I claim to have retired with any grace left?" His son Shusi was appointed registrar of Jiande. By then, Gong was already elderly and wished to have him nearby, but the post made this difficult. Shusi said: "Master Zeng would not leave his parents’ side even for a day—how could a mere five pecks of grain sway my lifelong resolve?" He resigned and returned home to care for his father. When his father died, Shusi’s grief was so profound that his bones jutted through his flesh. Even in the height of summer, he refused to remove his mourning hemp, and for years he could not bear to leave the family home. Only after much time did he return to office.

His elder brother Shuyuan served as magistrate of Wangjiang, both brothers under the jurisdiction of the Huainan surveillance commissioner. When someone recommended Shusi over his brother, Shusi sent a letter requesting that the recommendation be changed to favor his brother. When this was refused, he returned the official document unopened. Such was his devotion to righteousness. He rose to Gentleman for Court Service and likewise retired early. Neither father nor son waited for mandatory retirement age, and people universally admired them. Gong was posthumously honored with the epithet "Pure and Filial."

His son Shengzhong was recorded in the *Biographies of Confucian Scholars*. His grandson Lifang, great-grandson You, and five generations in all passed the imperial examinations, with three generations serving as drafters of imperial edicts. You eventually became chief minister under Emperors Guangzong and Ningzong. He once said: "In all twelve hours of the day, never deceive yourself." Such was his commitment to practice.

The compiler notes: Observing the Ge family—fathers, grandfathers, sons, grandsons, and brothers—how far their blessings extended! Some left high office for humble posts; some, though in positions of power, upheld integrity and the law; some father and son vied in their devotion to duty; some brothers recommended each other for promotion. Their purity, filial piety, and renown as Confucian scholars were unmatched in ancient times. Five generations of imperial examination success and three generations of drafting imperial edicts are rare even in recent eras. This surpasses even the Wang family’s Three Sophoras.

Song Xiang and his younger brother Qi both passed the imperial examinations. The Ministry of Rites ranked Qi first and Xiang second, but Empress Dowager Zhangxian, unwilling to let a younger brother precede his elder, promoted Xiang to first place and demoted Qi to tenth. People thus referred to them as "the Two Songs,

From the outset, he was regarded as a candidate for the position of prime minister not merely for his rank or minor promotions. The Song dynasty’s generosity toward its scholars, its deep-rooted fidelity to the village elders, surpassed that of the Han and Tang dynasties by far—yet these men, though far inferior in number, would sooner curse their own private interests than betray the public trust, sooner defy powerful ministers than deceive the court. Above, they did not fail the Son of Heaven; below, they did not betray what they had studied. In this, they may be said to have embodied the principle of sacrificing oneself for the Dao. Though some rose to high office and others did not, their essential character was already formed, and this alone qualifies them as great ministers. As for success or failure, profit or loss—what need is there to weigh such things?

Wang Anguo served as Professor at the Western Capital’s Directorate of Education. When his term expired and he arrived in the capital, the Emperor, on account of his brother Wang Anshi, specially summoned him and asked, “What sort of ruler was Emperor Wen of Han?” Anguo replied, “Since the Three Dynasties, there has been none like him.” The Emperor said, “The only regret is that his talent was insufficient to establish new laws and institutions.” Anguo responded, “When Emperor Wen came from Dai to enter the Weiyang Palace and settle the crisis, even a moment’s hesitation would have been impossible for one without talent. Yet he heeded Jia Yi’s counsel, treated his ministers with restraint, and devoted himself to transforming the people through virtue. The realm flourished with ritual and music, and he nearly achieved the abolition of corporal punishment—thus, Emperor Wen was a cut above those merely deemed talented.” The Emperor then asked, “Wang Meng assisted Fu Jian, and with such a small state, his commands were always obeyed. Now, with the vastness of my empire, why can I not make men obey?” Anguo replied, “Meng instructed Jian to enforce harsh laws and execute many, leading to the swift demise of the Qin dynasty. Today, petty and ruthless men must be misleading Your Majesty. I urge you to take Yao, Shun, and the Three Dynasties as your model—how could the people below not follow?” The Emperor then asked, “What does public opinion say of your brother’s governance?” Anguo answered, “They regret that he does not discern men’s character clearly and that his tax collection is too urgent.” The Emperor was displeased, and as a result, Anguo was only appointed Collator at the Chongwen Academy. He repeatedly remonstrated with Anshi over the harms of the New Policies and once labeled Lu Huiqing a sycophant, for which Huiqing bore a grudge.

**Recorded Note:** The Emperor’s questioning of Anguo was, in effect, a questioning of Anshi. Anshi probed the Emperor’s inclinations, which leaned toward the harshness of the two Qin dynasties, and so he exploited his power and favor to advance his private agenda. Anguo, recognizing his brother’s errors and his blindness to the flatterers around him, employed forthright words to dispel his delusions. Otherwise, the Wang family would have had no one left. Though Huiqing’s malevolence sought to behead Han Qi and Fu Bi, he ultimately lost his nerve—clearly, Heaven’s judgment was most evident. Though Anguo did not please the Emperor, he did not cut himself off from Heaven. Posterity does not condemn Anguo for Anshi’s faults; this much is clear.

Zeng Gong was orphaned young, and his younger brothers Bu and Zhao both studied under him. His writings drew their fundamental principles from the Six Classics, refined through the styles of Sima Qian and Han Yu. Few of his contemporaries could surpass his literary skill. Zhao, though young, devoted himself to study, mastering the classics and histories. His prose was temperate and well-structured. After governing eleven prefectures, he was known for his many virtuous policies. When Bu later gained power, from the Xining era onward for forty years, the struggle between the upright and the corrupt intensified, and factional disputes repeatedly arose. Zhao, caught in the midst of this turmoil, found himself at odds with his brother. When Bu served alongside Han Zhongyan as prime minister, he worked day and night to undermine Zhao. Zhao, stationed elsewhere, wrote to him, saying: “Now that you have the Emperor’s favor, you should promote good men, uphold the correct path, and prevent the resurgence of men like Zeng Dun and Bian. Yet for months, those of integrity and good fortune have left the court one after another, while those you advance to assist, attend, and oversee are often the very men who once served Dun and Bian. The situation shifts daily, and today’s allies are tomorrow’s tools for securing your position. The thought of it is enough to move one to tears. Recently, the Emperor’s intentions have shifted, the way of petty men has grown, and those who advance must first denounce the Yuanyou faction before the throne, then purge them from key positions upon returning. Even if Dun and Bian do not fully return, a single Cai Jing is enough to surpass them—this cannot be ignored.” Bu did not heed his advice. Soon after, Jing indeed gained power, and both Bu and Zhao were brought down.

**Recorded Note:** Since the two Songs and the two Sus gained renown, contemporaries like the Wangs of Jinling and the Zengs of Nanfeng were scarcely inferior in literature, conduct, or ability—one should not view them as fundamentally different. Yet a single bias of the heart, a single struggle for favor and rank, led one to deviance and the other to uprightness, as distant as heaven and earth, as distinct as fragrance and stench, as if placed in separate vessels. Their infamy persists to this day. Was this not because they slandered the upright, expelled the loyal and righteous, and devoted themselves to promoting the wicked to secure their positions and curry favor? As for the Wang brothers’ relationship to the New Policies, their divergence came late indeed.

When Emperor Huizong had already appointed Cai Jing as chief minister, he soon after reappointed Zeng Bu, and it was Zhao Ding who drafted the edict, stating: "The eastern and western halls divide the court; left and right ministers are established as aids." Alas! Why did he not at that time clarify right and wrong to determine departure or retention? Having already been relegated to external office, he then began to send letters—was this not too late? No wonder Zeng Bu could not follow his counsel.

Lü Zujian and Lü Zutai were the younger brothers of Lü Zuqian, having studied under him. After Lü Zuqian’s death, Lü Zujian was appointed supervisor of Mingzhou. According to the *Granary Regulations*, failure to submit reports within half a year constituted a violation, but Lü Zujian insisted on observing the full mourning period. The court acquiesced, issuing an edict setting a one-year limit—this precedent began with Lü Zujian.

When Emperor Ningzong ascended the throne, Lü Zujian was appointed vice-director of the Great Treasury. At the time, Han Tuozhou slandered Zhao Ruyu, and Lü Zujian submitted a sealed memorial, saying: "Your Majesty’s early governance was clear and bright, yet before long, Zhu Xi, an elder scholar, and Peng Gui’nian, a veteran of the old learning, were both permitted to depart. As for Li Xiang, whose age and sincerity inspire trust among the people—now he too is banished. I fear the realm will take warning from this."

Here the scholars who dare to speak face their greatest difficulty not in offending ruler or father, but in defying the will of those in power. To illustrate with what I know: nothing is harder than to discuss portents and anomalies, yet men speak freely of these because such matters do not touch upon power and influence. But when an imperial brush descends, the court dares not strongly oppose, the censors dare not press the issue, and the drafters dare not hold firm—all because the matter concerns the favored and the mighty, and all fear that questioning might provoke anger and bring grave offense. Recently, when those around the throne were dismissed or demoted, those who gained audience saw carriages and horses crowd their gates like a marketplace. Relying on power and estimating favor, they shake the outer court. I fear that if this trend continues, governance will fall into the hands of the favored, not the public chamber. All those they recommend will be their own; all those they cast down will be those they hate. Not only will men avert their eyes in fear, too afraid to point and speak, but flattery and compliance will spread, and the dangers of inner and outer collusion will surely become manifest. Do not think I am willful or reckless, courting punishment—it is only that the spirit of the scholar-officials has grown weak, and my private concern has led me to overthink. I deeply fear that Your Majesty’s position will become isolated, and those who might together uphold the altars of state will grow few.

An edict ordered Lü Zujian’s banishment to Shaozhou. Zhu Xi wrote to him, saying: “In rank I stand above you, and in imperial favor and courtesy I surpass you, yet I sat by and watched the misdeeds of the young clique, unable to speak in service to the throne. Now you alone have vented your indignation, provoked the petty men, and stepped into the snare of disaster—my shame and regret run deep.” Lü Zujian replied: “At court, hearing of current affairs was like standing in fire and water. I could not remain for a single day. Now, exiled to the countryside, I know nothing of order or chaos. What more is there to say?”

He once remarked: “Those who bend to the times and lose their usual conduct are not worth discussing. But those who, because of the times, let their will and spirit grow more intense—this too is a private impulse.”

Lü Zutai was open and unrestrained by nature, valuing righteousness and loyalty. His learning was broad and profound. He wandered rivers and lakes, befriending the renowned scholars of the age. When Lü Zujian was banished to a distant province, Lü Zutai walked there to visit him, staying over a month. He told his friend Wang Shenhou: “Since my brother’s demotion, men have sealed their lips. Though I hold no office, in duty I must speak to repay the state. I will wait a little longer, lest I bring trouble upon my brother.” After Lü Zujian died in exile, Lü Zutai submitted a memorial denouncing Han Tuozhou for harboring disloyal intent. “The Dao-scholars,” he wrote, “have since ancient times been relied upon to serve the state. To impose a ban on ‘false learning’ and expel the followers of Zhao Ruyu is to empty the realm—does Your Majesty not see this? Chen Ziqiang, a mere tutor to children, was kicked into the position of chief minister; Su Shidan, a petty clerk from Pingjiang, gained military command through his connection to the former princely residence; Zhou Jun, a servant in the Han household, obtained high office through the empress’s kin. Did Your Majesty, in your former residence, truly know Shidan? Did the empress’s family truly include Jun? All of Han Tuozhou’s clique exalt themselves and belittle the court—it has come to this. I urge the swift execution of Tuozhou and Shidan, and the dismissal of Chen Ziqiang’s faction. Only Zhou Bida is fit for office and should replace them.”

The memorial shocked the court and the realm. An edict declared him “privately motivated and wildly reckless,” and he was sentenced to a hundred strokes of the rod and exiled to Qinzhou.

A record states: Master Zhenwen once remarked that Dayu possessed the bearing of Chenggong, yet he remained but a minor prefectural aide. As for Tairan, he was merely a commoner of the lowest rank—without official duties, without the responsibility of remonstrance—yet why did he willingly tread upon perilous ground? After the Song court fled south, the Ming departed never to return, and treacherous and wicked men arose in succession, yet none matched the times of Tuozhou. Since the rise of the doctrine of "heterodox learning," it has been openly claimed that depravity, perversity, and extravagance are man’s true nature, while integrity and self-cultivation are but pretense. Never since the dawn of civilization has such a doctrine existed—it is even more insidious than the treachery of calling a deer a horse, more calamitous than the disaster of burning books and burying scholars alive. Any man may justly execute its proponents, how much more so those who have inherited the transmission of the Central Plains’ cultural legacy?

Moreover, in the reign of Emperor Renzong, both Duke Lü and Duke Han-Wei held the position of chief minister and enjoyed great renown, yet the divergence between their descendants in virtue and vice could not be more stark. Lü, though repeatedly banished and exiled, left a fragrance a hundredfold; while Han’s descendants, utterly depraved and vile, have earned eternal infamy. The gentleman cannot but sigh deeply at this.

The six brothers of the Lu family—Jiulong and his kin—were born to Father He, who for generations maintained a household of shared property, designating the eldest as the family head, to whom all household affairs were entrusted. The younger members divided the labor: some oversaw fields and taxes, others managed provisions, kitchens, or guests. Jiulong, inheriting his father’s will, further refined ritual learning and governed his household with order. Within the gates, a hundred mouths—men and women alike—were arranged by rank, each fulfilling their duties. The inner chambers were as solemn as the imperial court, yet filled with loyalty, reverence, harmony, and joy. The villagers, moved by their example, deferred to them as younger brothers. Jiulong and his brother Jiuyuan treated each other as teacher and friend, harmonious yet not identical, and scholars called them the "Two Lu." When students came seeking instruction, Jiulong would respond with ease, guiding each to their own understanding. If someone was not yet ready to grasp his words, he would remain silent. He once said: "There are delusions in men that cannot be dispelled by argument. Pressing too forcefully only entrenches their views; given time, they may yet awaken on their own."

Zhang Jingfu of Guanghan, though unacquainted with Jiulong, later exchanged letters with him on learning, shouldering the weight of the world’s moral order. Lü Zuqian often praised him, saying: "His aspirations are great, his foundations solid. Though obstacles may entangle him, he dares not claim success even after piling effort as high as nine *ren*. Though but a hair’s breadth of bias may exist, he dares not rest content even as a paragon to ten thousand men. He listens broadly, observes keenly, steps back to survey all sides, and will not act until he has reached the state of perfect equilibrium and purity."

His younger brother, Jiushao, was also deeply refined in learning. He lived in seclusion among the mountains, recording his daily words and deeds each night. He composed admonitory verses in rhyme, and at dawn, the family head would lead the assembled children and younger siblings to the ancestral shrine. There, after the rites, they would strike the drum and recite his words, requiring all to listen in order.

A record states: Observing the strictness of the Lu family’s household rules and the solemnity of their inner discipline, later generations may clearly follow and practice them. Zhang Gongyi’s single virtue of forbearance, though admirable, still falls short; here, the benefits of Dao-learning cannot be dismissed as merely maintaining a household of shared property for generations.

Shi Migong was the cousin of Mi Yuan. When he entered the Imperial Academy and advanced to the upper division, Mi Yuan, then wielding power, referred to him as "Jili" to avoid the appearance of favoritism, though he was not yet an official. Thus, Migong was denied examination and remained in obscurity for a decade. Only in the tenth year of Jiading did he finally pass the imperial examinations. In the early years of Duanping, he entered the capital as a supervisor of the Memorials Office. He once responded to an imperial edict with a memorial, saying: "Calamities within the imperial family are not unique to our age. Your Majesty’s fraternal affection has often been evident. The reason Hong Zikui earned Your Majesty’s special favor was his assertion that the events in Shu were not the true intent of Prince Ji, and that Prince Ji’s death was likewise not Your Majesty’s true intent. His words deeply resonated with Your Majesty’s heart."

The late emperor’s son, Your Majesty’s elder brother, was not even allowed to rest his remains in peace—how could this not disrupt the harmony of qi and summon calamities? At the time, a certain Deng Ruoshui also submitted a memorial, saying: "Only by upholding great righteousness can great slander be dispelled; only by reclaiming great authority can the great throne be secured; only by eliminating great treachery can great peril be quelled."

When Emperor Ningzong passed, Prince Ji was rightfully heir to the throne. Yet his deposition was never heard by the late emperor, nor were his faults ever made known to the people. Shi Miyuan, unwilling to see him enthroned, falsified the late emperor’s decree, banished Prince Ji, and even murdered the imperial grandson. Within half a year, Miyuan himself perished by Lake Dongting. By the standards of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, was this not regicide? Was it not usurpation? The realm laid blame squarely on Miyuan, yet dared not impute fault to Your Majesty—why? In that sudden crisis, it was not something Your Majesty could have known, and we trusted that Your Majesty could never have harbored such intent. But now, years have passed, and Your Majesty’s firm resolve remains unsteady, your authority unasserted, failing to fulfill the hopes of the realm. Those who once trusted Your Majesty now suspect complicity; those who once believed you unaware now suspect you knew all along. How can Your Majesty endure this stain beneath the bright sun and blue sky? This is what I mean by upholding great righteousness to dispel great slander.

The *Record* states: Deng Ruoshui’s plea for Prince Ji’s wrongs was just, but could Shi Migong, as a younger brother, rightfully plead against his elder? In the Song’s golden age, Lü Duan even locked away Li Jien’en to ensure the enthronement of the true heir, Zhenzong. At that time, did he not fear the crown prince’s brilliance, as Shi Xinen did? Yet he could not alter the succession, for the Golden Casket Pact was still fresh, and the imperial lineage’s bonds too close. No one could question the near over the distant, the old over the new. In the reign of Emperor Lizong, the empire had already faced the disgrace of the Five Nations City and the suspicion of a tenth-generation descendant. The realm’s affairs were like an inn—guests felt no gratitude, while hosts counted themselves fortunate. All was left to the whims of treacherous ministers, yet the principles of justice and the Dao of integrity could not be said to have vanished from the land. Still, no remedy could be found, for those in power saw seizing the throne as triumph and securing succession as favor. When would they have leisure to follow the example of Taibo and Jizi, acting with restraint and deference? Thus, the outcome was hardly surprising.

Cao Youwen and Cao Youliang were twelfth-generation descendants of Emperor Wu of the State of Cao. Both brothers harbored great ambitions, seeking teachers and friends without regard for distance. In the second year of Baoqing, Youwen passed the imperial examinations and was appointed instructor of Tianshui Prefecture. When Tianshui came under siege, Youwen and the prefectural governor, Zhang Wei, rallied the people to resist fiercely. After the enemy retreated, the military commissioner commended them. From then on, Youliang and Wan each gained renown for their martial prowess. They were dispatched to guard Xianren Pass and later defended Qifang Pass. When the Yuan forces invaded Da’an, Commander He Jin was killed in battle. Youwen and Wan led their troops through mountain paths, slew the enemy general, and were appointed to oversee Tianshui’s defenses. Later, Youwen and Youliang repeatedly directed battles with distinction, earning promotions to Martial Wing Grandee and Imperial Guard Commander-in-Chief.

At the time, Zhao Yannu advanced to Qingye Plain, where the Yuan forces besieged him. Youwen declared: "Qingye is the throat of Shu—we cannot delay." Wan led troops to intercept the enemy at midnight, breaking the siege. He was promoted to Martial Virtue Grandee, Valiant Cavalry General, and appointed Frontline Commander of the Sichuan Military Commission.

The following year, the Yuan crown prince, Kuoduan, assembled over five hundred thousand troops, both Mongol and Han, and prepared to advance. Youwen said: "The fate of the state hinges on this battle. Outnumbered as we are, we cannot fight recklessly. We must seize the high ground, hold the passes, and ambush the enemy with surprise tactics." Military Commissioner Zhao Yannu ordered Youwen to secure Da’an to protect the Shu frontier. Youwen disagreed, but Yannu overruled him. Instead, he sent Wan and Youliang to Yingguan Pass, where they displayed numerous banners to deceive the enemy into thinking the defenses were strong. Youwen selected elite troops and secretly set an ambush at Liuxi. He instructed: "When the enemy arrives, sound the drums and raise the signal fires."

The Yuan forces arrived as expected, and Wan engaged them head-on. Youwen dispatched Commander Yang Daquan to strike the rear, Commander Xia Yong to attack the center, and Lü Side to charge the vanguard. Youwen himself led three thousand crack troops in a swift march to the pass. A violent storm erupted; the Western troops, who used cotton cloaks in place of armor, found them soaked and useless. The Yuan forces, reinforced by iron-clad cavalry, encircled them on all sides. Youwen sighed: "This must be Heaven’s will. I can only die here." He cursed the enemy vehemently, slew his own horse to show his resolve, and fought with redoubled fury. He and his brother, along with their entire army, perished to the last man. The Yuan forces then swept into Shu unopposed.

Wang Shixian of Qinzhou and Gongzhou had long admired Youwen’s reputation. He once gifted him a fine horse. When the Yuan army passed the battlefield on their return, Wang lamented: "The Shu general was a true man of valor."

The *Record* states: By this point in the Song’s decline, even the wisest could do nothing. Earlier, Jia Sidao’s border provocations had invited disaster; the Yuan had already ravaged Jie and Cheng, harassed Xing and Mian, and penetrated Jin and Fang to threaten Xiangyang. Yet the court still debated the succession at Xianyuan, and Shu’s defenses held. At that time, no one yet considered fleeing by sea. But after Youwen’s death and the fall of Shu, the Yuan seized the advantage of the Yangtze’s currents, and nothing could stop their advance. Thus, the Song was driven to the ends of the earth. Had they recognized the signs earlier, they might have secured a better end. Therefore, how can rulers not take heed of treacherous ministers misleading the state?

The Cao brothers neither shamed the martial glory of their ancestors above nor disgraced the lineage that bore them below. Their deaths carried weight greater than Mount Tai, bearing upon the fate of the dynasty and altars of state—one cannot regard them as ordinary battles. Yuanwang, Yuanbo, and their elder brother Xuanbo, four generations unbroken in loyalty, shared a household of over a hundred without a single discordant word. When Xuanbo died, he entrusted family affairs to his nephew Gui. Gui declined, saying, "It is the duty of my uncle." Yuanbo replied, "You are the eldest son of the main line." After prolonged deference, the matter was finally entrusted to Gui. Even scholar-official families claimed they could not match them. Their wives each gathered in one room to do women’s work, pooling all they produced into a single storehouse, with no private hoards in their chambers. Even the youngest children were nursed together by one woman; if a mother returned home to visit her parents and left her child behind, the other women did not ask which was her own, nor did the children know which was their mother.

The *Record* states: The *Prefectural Gazetteer* notes that the Chen family of Jiangzhou kept over a hundred dogs that shared a single pen and ate from one trough—if one dog failed to arrive, none would eat. This was no different. Here, the account is thus abridged.

Yet when the young ones wept, whichever mother saw them would take them up and nurse them—this was indeed the case. Here it is recorded.

*The Annals of Queli* states: Kong Liang, styled Chongbo, was the fifty-seventh-generation descendant of the Sage. His father, Kong Xifeng, and mother, née Wang, had six sons: Liang, the eldest, followed by Ping, Zheng, Lun, Jin, and Zhen. Liang’s affection for his brothers was especially deep. At home, they always shared a single table for meals; when going out, they rode side by side, halting their chopsticks or reining in their horses if one was absent, waiting without sign of weariness. When relatives or friends visited, he would pour wine and summon his brothers in turn to toast and urge each other on. They discoursed on the classics, chanted poetry, and took turns reciting hundreds of lines, delightful to hear and to love. Many of his brothers were refined and improved by his influence. The elders of the clan often exhorted their kinsmen, saying, “If you could be like the Chongbo brothers, it would suffice.” The scholar-officials of Zou and Lu all regarded them as fine scions of the Kong family. When Liang died, they gathered to weep at his memorial tablet and privately bestowed the posthumous epithet *Dun You* (“Sincere Friend”).

The *Record* states: Confucius said, “Friends admonish one another earnestly; brothers dwell together in harmony.” The proper measure of each relationship differs. Yet one like *Dun You* may truly be said to have cherished the memory of his ancestors. This is why it is recorded here.

Thus ends *Hongdao Record*, Scroll Twenty-Four.

*Hongdao Record*, Scroll Twenty-Five: *Virtue*

Friendship’s Principle

Mencius said: “Those below honoring those above is called ‘honoring the noble.’ Those above honoring those below is called ‘revering worthies.’ Honoring the noble and revering worthies—these principles are one.”

The *Record* states: What is called the Grand Peace—was it not the age of Yao and Shun? How was it that high and low intermingled? When you and I stand as equals, our positions are of the same rank, and the Way of friendship becomes narrow. If one were to extend its principle to its fullest, it would be as if the Son of Heaven befriended a commoner without impropriety, or a commoner befriended the Son of Heaven without presumption. Yet when one does not fathom the Way of Heaven, it appears that those below honoring those above is compliant and easy, while those above honoring those below is contrary and difficult. Who would willingly humble themselves to take the lead before a commoner? Nevertheless, there are those who descend from their halls to seek out feudal lords—this cannot be called ‘revering worthies.’ And the so-called worthies of that time, when weighed against Confucius and Mencius, are no different from the shallow and the profound. Thus Confucius upheld the ritual of bowing to those below, and Mencius expounded the principle of revering worthies—their intent was one and the same.

The *Counsels of Gao Yao* states: “I, the humble one, once studied under Gan Pan. Later, I encountered him in the wilderness and entered his dwelling by the river. From the river to the ancestral temple at Bo, until the end of his days, his glory was unparalleled. You alone can instruct my will.”

If you brew sweet wine, you must rely on yeast and malt;
If you prepare a harmonious stew, you must rely on salt and plums.
When you cultivate yourself in relation to me, I shall not cast you aside—
I shall only advance your teachings if I am capable of doing so.

The *Record* states: In the hexagram *Dui* (兑), two marshes lie side by side, and ruler and minister delight in one another. When two marshes lie side by side, they mutually nourish and irrigate, each benefiting the other. When ruler and minister delight in one another, they mutually encourage and together partake in the blessings of great peace. Thus, its image is that of friends studying together, and its Dao is that of learning.

Later, when the minister first appeared, the yang line occupied the lowest position in the hexagram, so he had long labored in obscurity. By the time of *Shang Dui* (商兑), he had not yet found peace, so he was again driven into the wilderness, dwelling by the river. Yet when he finally arrived, he moved in accord with the celestial signs above and the hearts of the people below, standing resolute with joy, and blessings flowed without cease. This is how the governance of King Gaozong came to fruition.

Had he been swayed by the auspiciousness of *He Dui* (和兑) or misled by the inauspiciousness of *Lai Dui* (来兑), and upon his arrival indulged in the private inclinations of *Xie Dui* (邪兑), then yin would have overwhelmed yang, petty men would have thrived while the noble man stood alone, and the ensuing calamity would have been beyond description. This is why the ruler at the ninth-five position must remain vigilant and cautious.

The sage inscribed in the text: *"Trust in the stripping away brings danger."* Alas! Should this not serve as a warning for the Yin dynasty?

In the *Hong Fan*, in the thirteenth year of his reign, the king consulted Jizi, saying: "Alas! Heaven, in its hidden way, sustains the people below, harmonizing their dwellings. I do not understand the constant norms of their proper order."

Jizi then spoke: "I have heard that in ancient times, Gun dammed the floodwaters, throwing the Five Phases into chaos. The Lord was enraged and did not bestow upon him the *Hong Fan* of Nine Categories. Gun was executed for disrupting the constant norms. Then Yu arose as his successor, and Heaven bestowed upon him the *Hong Fan* of Nine Categories. The constant norms were thus restored. The first is the Five Phases; the second, reverently applying the Five Affairs; the third, managing the Eight Policies; the fourth, harmonizing the Five Regulations; the fifth, establishing the Royal Standard; the sixth, employing the Three Virtues; the seventh, clarifying the resolution of doubts; the eighth, heeding the various portents; the ninth, bestowing the Five Blessings and wielding the Six Calamities.

1. **The Five Phases**: First, Water; second, Fire; third, Wood; fourth, Metal; fifth, Earth.
   - Water moistens and descends; Fire flames and ascends; Wood can be bent or straightened; Metal can be molded or altered; Earth is for sowing and reaping.

2. **The Five Affairs**: First, appearance; second, speech; third, vision; fourth, hearing; fifth, thought.

3. **The Eight Policies**: First, food; second, goods; third, sacrifices; fourth, the Minister of Works; fifth, the Minister of Education; sixth, the Minister of Justice; seventh, hospitality; eighth, the military.

4. **The Five Regulations**: First, the year; second, the month; third, the day; fourth, the stars and constellations; fifth, the calendar.

5. **The Royal Standard**: The king establishes the supreme standard, gathering the Five Blessings in due time to bestow them upon the myriad people. Only when the myriad people adhere to your standard will you be granted the preservation of that standard.
   - Be without bias or partiality; follow the king’s righteousness.
   - Do not indulge personal preferences; follow the king’s Dao.
   - Do not indulge personal vices; follow the king’s path.
   - Be without faction or partisanship; the king’s Dao is vast and open.
   - Be without partisanship or bias; the king’s Dao is level and even.
   - Be without perversity or deviation; the king’s Dao is upright and straight.
   - Converge upon the supreme standard; return to the supreme standard.

6. **The Three Virtues**: First, uprightness; second, firmness in overcoming; third, gentleness in overcoming.

7. **Resolving Doubts**: Then command the diviners of milfoil and turtle shell, who will say: rain, clear skies, cloudiness, overcast, victory, constancy, or obscurity. There are seven in total—five from divination, two from oracle interpretation—lest one err in judgment.

8. **The Various Portents**: Rain, sunshine, warmth, cold, wind, and timeliness. When these five come in full measure, each in its proper order, the myriad plants flourish. If one is in excess, calamity follows.

9. **The Five Blessings**: First, longevity; second, wealth; third, health and peace; fourth, love of virtue; fifth, a good end to one’s lifespan.
   **The Six Calamities**: First, early death; second, illness; third, sorrow; fourth, poverty; fifth, evil; sixth, weakness."

The *Record* states: This is the teaching of the Royal Standard expounded in full, which Jizi conveyed to King Wu. Those who inherit the transmission of the Dao’s lineage must not regard this lightly. *Yi* (彝) refers to what is most constant and unchanging; *Hong* (洪) to what is most vast and boundless; *Lun* (伦) to the unchanging principles by which the Yin followed the Xia and the Zhou followed the Yin; *Fan* (范) to the great unity by which Yu transmitted it to Tang, and Tang to Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou. None but Jizi could have grasped this, none but King Wu could have heard it, and thus it was transmitted to the world. How could rulers of all ages remain ignorant of it?

In the *Record of Rites*, it is said: Once, when Confucius was at the Biyin sacrifice, the rites concluded, and he went out to stroll above the ancestral temple’s terrace. He sighed deeply. Yan Yan, who was at his side, asked: "Master, why do you sigh?"

Confucius replied: "The practice of the Great Dao, and the excellence of the Three Dynasties’ sages—I have not lived to see them, but I hold them in my aspirations. When the Great Dao prevailed, the world was held in common. The worthy and capable were selected, trust was cultivated, and harmony was fostered. Thus, people did not love only their own parents, nor did they rear only their own children. The elderly were ensured a peaceful end, the able-bodied had work, the young were nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, childless, and disabled were all cared for. Men had their roles, and women had their homes. They hated to see resources cast aside on the ground yet did not hoard them for themselves; they hated to withhold their strength yet did not exert it for their own gain."

Thus, schemes were suppressed and not entertained, and theft, disorder, and harm did not arise. Therefore, outer doors were left unbolted—this was called the Great Unity.

Now that the Great Dao has receded, the world has become a domain of private households. Each cherishes only their own kin, each rears only their own children, and wealth and labor are claimed for oneself. Lords pass down their positions to their heirs as a matter of ritual propriety; walls, moats, and ramparts are built for defense. Ritual and righteousness serve as the guiding principles to rectify the relationship between ruler and subject, to deepen the bond between father and son, to harmonize brothers, to unite husband and wife, to establish systems and institutions, to organize fields and settlements, to reward the brave and wise, and to measure merit by personal gain. Hence, schemes arise from this, and warfare emerges thereby.

Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, King Cheng, and the Duke of Zhou were all selected under these conditions—this is called the Lesser Peace.

It is recorded: "Why did the Master utter this sigh?"
"Standing at the center of the world, securing the people of the Four Seas—this is what the noble person desires, and thus he sighed."
"Why was Yan the one to whom he spoke?"
"Yan governs through ritual and music. When the governance of ritual and music is applied in full, it becomes the Great Unity; when applied in part, it becomes the Lesser Peace. The Great Unity regards all under heaven as one family, the central states as one person, and a thousand myriad generations as a single day. The Lesser Peace may be achieved in a year or perfected in three. If I were to serve the declining Zhou, it would suffice."
"Who but Yan is worthy of such discourse?"

Some have erred in doubting that these were not the Master’s own words. When Yan Yuan asked how to govern a state, the Master said: "Follow the Xia calendar, ride the Yin chariot, and wear the Zhou cap. For music, employ the *Shao* and *Wu* dances; banish the tunes of Zheng and keep flatterers at a distance. The music of Zheng is licentious, and flatterers are perilous."

It is recorded: The Master’s sigh for the practice of the Great Dao and the heroes of the Three Dynasties—was this merely recitation and longing? What he weighed in his heart and turned over in his thoughts were the unchanging great laws of a hundred kings and the enduring great Dao of a thousand ages. Thus, he later told Yuan: "When employed, act; when set aside, withdraw. Only you and I possess this." To be employed means, at its greatest, to become like Tang and Yu; at its next, to become like the Three Dynasties—not merely petty arrangements. This is the essence of mutual refinement among the disciples of Confucius, most vital to the realm and the state. Even ten thousand generations hence, it must not be regarded as empty rhetoric. Thus, he succeeded the Four Sages.

King Xuan commanded the Marquis of Fan, Zhongshan Fu, to build a city in Qi, and Yin Jifu composed a poem to send him off, saying:

"Heaven brought forth the teeming people,
Giving them things and giving them laws.
The people’s constant norms:
To love this fine virtue.
Heaven watches over the Zhou,
Its bright majesty descending below.
To protect this Son of Heaven,
It gave birth to Zhongshan Fu.

Zhongshan Fu’s virtue—
Gentle and excellent, the very model,
With fine bearing and gracious mien,
Ever cautious and reverent.
He takes ancient teachings as his pattern,
Exerts himself in dignified conduct.
He follows the Son of Heaven’s will,
Who entrusts him with the bright mandate to levy.

The king commands Zhongshan Fu,
To be the model for all the feudal lords.
He reveres the ancestors,
And guards the king’s own person.
Issuing and receiving the royal commands,
He is the king’s voice and tongue.
Administering governance abroad,
The four quarters all respond.
Solemn is the royal command,
And Zhongshan Fu carries it out.
Whether states fare well or ill,
Zhongshan Fu discerns it clearly.
Both enlightened and wise,
He preserves his own person.
Day and night without remiss,
He serves the One Man.

As the saying goes:
The soft, one swallows;
The hard, one spits out.
But Zhongshan Fu—
Soft, he does not swallow;
Hard, he does not spit out.
He does not bully the orphaned and widowed,
Nor fear the strong and overbearing.

Another saying:
Virtue’s wheel is light as a feather,
Yet few among the people can lift it—
I take it as my measure.
Though Zhongshan Fu lifts it,
None love to aid him.
If any office has a flaw,
Only Zhongshan Fu mends it.

Zhongshan Fu sets out on his journey,
His four steeds sturdy and strong,
The travelers swift and alert.
Ever mindful of what remains undone,
His four steeds gallop,
The eight bells ring clear.
The king commands Zhongshan Fu
To build a city in the east.
His four steeds prance,
The eight bells chime in order.
Zhongshan Fu completes his task in Qi,
And prepares to return.
Jifu composes this ode,
Gentle as a pure breeze.
Zhongshan Fu bears it in mind,
To comfort his heart.

Bao Gong served as minister, aiding Su Gong,
So Su Gong composed a poem to break with him, saying:

Who is that man?
His heart is most perverse.
Why does he pass my dam,
Yet not enter my gate?
Whom does he follow?
Only Bao, it is said.
The two travel together—
Who brought this misfortune?
Why does he roam my dam,
Yet not come to console me?
At first, he was not thus,
But now he finds me unacceptable.

Who is that man?
Why does he pass my line of sight?
I hear his voice,
But see not his form.
He feels no shame before others,
Nor awe before Heaven.

Who is that man?
He is like a whirlwind—
Why comes he not from the north,
Nor from the south?
Why does he pass my dam,
Only to trouble my heart?

If you walk at ease,
You have no time to rest.
If you rush in haste,
You have time to grease your wheels.
When you came before,
Why did you sigh so deeply?

If you return and enter,
My heart will be at ease.
If you return but do not enter,
It is hard to know your intent.
When you came before,
You made me anxious.

My elder brother plays the *xun*,
My younger brother plays the *chi*.
With you, I was as close as a string of coins—
Surely you do not know me.
Bring forth these three things,
And swear an oath against me.
Be it ghost or ant,
You shall not escape.
If you have a face and eyes,
And look upon others without limit..."

This fine song is made to express all restless longing.

Master Wang says: Bao Gong was disloyal to his lord and unrighteous toward his friend—what is called a grave offense. Thus Su Gong cut ties with him. Yet in cutting ties, he did not denounce Bao Gong directly, but only spoke of those who followed him; he did not expose their discord, but merely hinted at his suspicions. Even after severing the bond, he still explained how the other’s coming had made him anxious. For the noble man is loyal in his own conduct and forgiving in his dealings with others. If Bao Gong were to repent and return with goodwill, that would indeed be his wish. Though he might not do so, he would not go to extremes—how could he be like a petty man, who, once estranged, reviles and rejects, fearing only reconciliation?

It is recorded: Fan and Yin, Bao and Su—all were ministers of the royal court, yet their bond was that of friends. Their poems are like the clear wind, like the whirlwind. When the world follows the Dao, all cherish virtue and toil day and night without respite, as naturally as the sky is high and the sun bright, unaware of their own ease. When the world loses the Dao, ghosts and demons arise, and slander spreads like wildfire, as waves surge and winds scatter, unaware of their own strangeness. When these two winds blow, the Zhou way diverges. This is how poetry can inspire and reveal.

The *Comprehensive Mirror* states: The king sought to execute Du Bo without just cause. Du Bo’s friend Zuo Ru remonstrated nine times, but the king refused. The king said, “You side with your friend against your lord.” Zuo Ru replied, “If the lord’s way is right but the friend’s is wrong, I follow the lord to punish the friend. If the friend’s way is right but the lord’s is wrong, I follow the friend to oppose the lord.” The king grew angry: “Change your words and live; refuse, and die.” Zuo Ru said, “A scholar does not bend righteousness to follow death, nor alter his words to seek life. I can only make clear the lord’s error and prove Du Bo’s innocence.” The king executed Du Bo, and Zuo Ru died with him.

It is recorded: Though Du Bo’s case cannot be verified, Zuo Ru’s nine remonstrances show his steadfast loyalty to righteousness. Yet if one sides with a friend against the lord, the friendship is forsaken; if one follows the friend when the lord is wrong, the lord is opposed. Should one take the blame upon himself to spare another, or die in vain without benefit?

The *Zuozhuan* states: Shi Bo, Shi Hui, and Xun Linfu were all ministers of Jin. When Shi Bo was sent to Qin to summon Prince Yong, Xun Linfu stopped him, saying, “The crown prince still lives, yet you seek a lord from abroad—this will not succeed. Why not decline on grounds of illness? If not, you should take the acting minister with you.”

"Why must we share the same office to be colleagues before I dare not give my utmost? He would not listen, so I composed three stanzas of the *Ban* poem—still he would not listen. Later, when Zhao Dun turned against Shi Bo to enthrone Duke Ling, Shi Bo fled, and Xun Bo sent all his family and possessions—his goods, utensils, and wealth—to Qin, saying, ‘For the sake of our shared office.’

It is recorded: Xun Bo’s reasoning was sound. Yet why did he not speak in the royal court but instead privately conspire with Mi? When Shuai and Dun, father and son, held power, their hearts remained loyal to the Jin state. The debate over enthroning the elder prince was already grave, and their resolve to resist Qin was firm. Jia Ji once summoned Prince Le, only to have him killed. Was Jia Ji’s exile not precisely for this reason? In the sixth year, Jin’s Hu Shegu killed Yang Chufu and fled. Some claimed it was for encroaching on office, others for leaking secrets—neither was true.

Alas! Had they heeded the words of Kui and Guan, the disaster at Linghu might never have arisen. Repeated strife and calamities nearly brought Jin to ruin. As the saying goes: *‘You and I conspire together—heed my clamor’*—this was surely meant for Dun. How regrettable that none could speak to him!

When Xian Mi fled to Qin, Shi Hui followed. After three years in Qin, he still did not meet with him. Someone said, ‘He could drive a man from his state but cannot meet him here—what use is he?’ Shi Hui replied, ‘I share his guilt; I do not follow him out of righteousness. What is there to see?’ When he returned, he still did not meet him.

It is recorded: This is how Sui Hui returned to his state, and why Shi Bo left no descendants. As a chief minister of Jin, when he went to Qin, the crown prince was still alive. Yet he could not speak forthrightly to admonish and uphold the duty of selfless loyalty. When Xun Bo remonstrated, he failed to act with foresight to fulfill his duty as a colleague and friend. In both advance and retreat, he had no ground to stand on. Had Shi Hui been bound by petty scruples, unaware of self-preservation, shuttling back and forth in blind allegiance, he would have lost the way of steadfast integrity and could not have achieved a good end. Thus the *Yijing* says: *‘Before harm is felt.’* How profound its intent!

The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: Guan Yiwu and Bao Shuya were friends. In Guan’s youth, when he was poor, he traded for Bao Shu and took more than his share of the profits. Bao Shu did not think him greedy, knowing he was impoverished. When Guan devised plans for Bao Shu that led to great hardship, Bao Shu did not think him foolish, knowing that times have their fortunes and misfortunes. Thrice Guan entered office and thrice was expelled by his lord; Bao Shu did not think him unworthy, knowing he had not met his time. Thrice he fought and thrice he fled; Bao Shu did not think him cowardly, knowing he had an aged mother. When the cause of his lord, Prince Jiu, failed and Guan was imprisoned and humiliated, Bao Shu did not think him shameless, knowing he did not blush at small matters but only at his name not being renowned in the world. Thus Guan once said: ‘My parents gave me life, but Bao Shu knows me.’

Lian Xiangru returned the jade intact to Zhao, and the king made him chief minister, ranking above Lian Po. Po said, ‘When I see Xiangru, I will surely humiliate him.’ Hearing this, Xiangru often claimed illness to avoid court. If he caught sight of Po, he would turn his carriage aside to hide. His retainers thought it shameful. Xiangru said: ‘Compare the Lord of Lian to the King of Qin. With the King of Qin’s might, I once berated him in court and shamed his ministers. Though I am mediocre, would I fear the Lord of Lian alone? But I consider this: the reason mighty Qin does not dare attack Zhao is solely because the two of us remain. If two tigers fight, they cannot both survive. I act as I do to put the state’s crisis before private enmity.’ Hearing this, Lian Po stripped to the waist, carried thorns on his back, and came to Xiangru’s gate to apologize. They became friends who would die for each other.

It is recorded: Since the names of Guan and Bao, Kang and Lian became renowned, none through the ages have not admired their tale. Yet observe their reasoning: it lies in the realm of reckless passion, not in the beauty of Dao, virtue, benevolence, or righteousness. As the saying goes: *‘A king seeks a king, a hegemon seeks a hegemon’*—this is generally the case. Though the world declines and the Dao wanes, there have been men like Sun, Pang, Fan, Wei, Su, and Zhang who, though their ribs were broken and their feet severed, willingly gave their lives to seek vengeance. Their lords, failing to understand, amassed grudges and repaid favors with exacting precision. It is like children in a village alley, playing at familiarity, yet when repayment does not match the deed, they erupt in anger. If their parents are wise, they apologize for them; if not, they bring shame upon their neighborhood. Thus, the deeds of these four men—were they truly virtuous?

Lu Zhonglian delighted in bold and unconventional strategies. He refused office and official duties, roaming among the feudal lords with his lofty integrity. In the time of King Xiaocheng of Zhao, when Qin’s army besieged Handan, King Anxi of Wei sent General Jin Bi to rescue Zhao. Fearing Qin, he halted at Dangyin and did not advance. An envoy, Xin Yuan Yan, persuaded Zhao through Lord Pingyuan to jointly honor Qin as emperor and thus repel its army. Hearing this, Zhonglian went to see Yan and said: ‘That Qin is a state that discards ritual and righteousness to exalt beheading as merit. If it arrogantly proclaims itself emperor, then I would sooner tread the Eastern Sea to die than be its subject. Now Qin is a state of ten thousand chariots, and Liang is also a state of ten thousand chariots. If you follow it in calling it emperor, Qin will conduct the affairs of the Son of Heaven, issuing commands to the world. It will replace the ministers of the feudal lords, removing the unworthy and installing the worthy, removing the hated and installing the beloved. How could the King of Liang remain at ease?’ Yan rose and bowed twice, saying: ‘Only now do I know you, sir, as a true man of the world.’"

The court dared not again speak of making Qin emperor.

Lu's note says: Though Lu Lian’s refusal to allow Qin’s imperial claim was grand in intent, his argument was flawed. Why not say instead: "Heaven is noble, earth is base"? Zhou was the Son of Heaven; Qin, a feudal lord; and the other states, also feudal lords. To acknowledge Zhou’s supremacy and yet make Qin emperor would be to degrade the sun’s majesty, lowering it to the level of all things—how then could the people look up to its light? Lu Lian’s vow to tread the Eastern Sea and die was not only right in name but also proper in speech.

Some say: In the Warring States, men pursued profit and shunned harm. Had Lu Lian not acted for profit, how could Qin’s demands have been met? Had there been no harm, how could the feudal lords’ aid have arrived? This is not so. Qin had once declared itself emperor, only to abandon the title—such vacillation left it at a loss. Had it not feared the principle that "Heaven has no two suns, nor the people two kings," would it have retreated fifty *li*? Others say: Lu Lian’s arguments were inconsistent—was this the Grand Historian’s error? In essence, Zou and Lu were states that upheld ritual and righteousness, and Mencius was their purest exemplar. Lu Lian and the two scholars were largely pure, with only minor flaws.

Zhao Liang met with Shang Yang. Shang Yang asked: "In your view, how does my governance of Qin compare to that of the Five Sheepskin Duke?" Zhao Liang replied: "The compliance of a thousand men is not worth the frankness of one scholar. Permit me to speak plainly without fear of punishment—may I?" Shang Yang said: "Very well." Zhao Liang said: "The Five Sheepskin Duke was a rustic from Jing. Duke Mu raised him from among the cattle herders and placed him above the people, and none in Qin dared rival him. As minister, he served six or seven years, yet when he led an expedition against Zheng, he thrice enthroned a lord of Jin and once rescued Chu from disaster. In office, he toiled without riding in a carriage, and in the heat, he did not unfurl a canopy. When the Five Sheepskin Duke died, men and women of Qin wept, children ceased their songs, and pestle-wielders paused in their labor. But your governance, my lord, has trampled the ducal clans, harmed the common people, and forced Lord Qian to bar his gates for eight years. You have executed Zhu Guan and mutilated Gongsun Jia. As the *Book of Songs* says: 'Those who win the people thrive; those who lose them collapse.' These acts are no way to win the people. Your peril is like the morning dew, yet you still covet the wealth of Shang and Yu, cling to power in Qin, and store up the people’s resentment. The day the King of Qin discards you, even your retainers will not attend court. How trivial will be the means by which Qin destroys you!"

Shang Yang did not heed him. Five months later, disaster struck.

Lu's note says: Even with Shang Yang’s authority, he tolerated Zhao Liang’s admonition—was this not the remnant of his good conscience? Tigers and wolves are fierce, devouring men while howling; the virtue that desires life exists in all things, but it is overcome by desire. Did Shang Yang initially intend such cruelty? No—his heart was mastered by desire, and without such measures, he could not have moved Duke Xiao to seize immediate, great profit. Yet the peril to himself was clear. Even so, why punish plain speech? Alas, Zhao Liang’s counsel was incomplete. Shang Yang’s abolition of the well-field system and opening of the paths and furrows was a crime that reached to heaven, nearly extinguishing the laws of the former kings—who bears the greatest blame? Even if one plucked out all his hairs, they would not suffice to count his offenses. How could mere frankness address them? Yet Zhao Liang is not to be faulted. Su Qin, though called worthy, was torn apart by chariots as just retribution for his role in Qin’s destruction. Even so, could the laws of the former kings be set aside and ignored?

From the *Later Han Records*: Yan Guang, young and renowned, studied with Emperor Guangwu. When the latter ascended the throne, Yan changed his name and concealed himself. The emperor, valuing his worth, sought him out. The state of Qi reported: "A man, clad in sheepskin, fishes in the marshes." The emperor suspected it was Yan and sent envoys with a carriage draped in black and drawn by black horses to summon him. After three missions, Yan arrived and was lodged in the Northern Army camp, provided with cushions and mattresses, and served meals by the imperial kitchen. Minister of Education Hou Ba, an old acquaintance, sent a letter: "Hearing of your arrival, I wished to visit at once, but my duties prevent me. I will come at dusk to speak with you." Yan did not reply but handed the messenger a note: "Junfang, your position is lofty—excellent. Cherish benevolence, aid righteousness, and the world will rejoice. Flatter and obey, and your neck will be severed."

When Hou Ba presented the letter to the emperor, he laughed and said, "A mad fellow—still his old ways." The emperor then personally visited Yan’s lodging, but Yan did not rise to greet him. The emperor approached where Yan lay outside, patting his belly and saying, "Tut, Ziling, can you not assist me in governing?" Yan did not respond. After a long while, he opened his eyes and fixed his gaze, saying, "Of old, when Tang Yao displayed his virtue, Chaofu washed his ears. A scholar has his own aspirations—why must you press me so?" The emperor said, "Ziling, can I truly not have you?" Thereupon, he mounted his carriage, sighing as he departed. Later, he summoned Yan again to discuss the Dao and past affairs, and they sat facing each other for days. The emperor asked casually, "How do I compare to my former self?" Yan replied, "Your Majesty has improved somewhat." Then they lay down together, and Yan placed his feet upon the emperor’s belly. The next day, the Grand Historian reported: "A guest star has trespassed upon the imperial seat with great urgency." The emperor smiled and said, "It is only my old friend Yan Ziling lying beside me." He appointed Yan as Remonstrance Grandee, but Yan refused, choosing instead to farm on Mount Fuchun. Later generations named the place Yanling Shoals.

It is recorded: Observing Yan Guang, one sees five reasons he could not be retained, and the rank of the Three Dukes was not among them. Without studying Confucius, one cannot perceive the mean of benevolence and righteousness; without consulting Mencius, one cannot grasp the balance of withdrawal and engagement. Though Yan did not display extreme conduct, he spoke of being pressed beyond endurance—this shows he did not understand the righteousness of serving the feudal lords. Thus, he changed his name and fished in the marshes. If he truly wore sheepskin, he had his reasons—this is the first. When summoned as an old friend, he should have been treated as one; that would have been proper. When a grandee summons a forester, the forester dies rather than go—how then could an old friend be kept when summoned as a remonstrance official? This is the second. Duke Mu of Lu had no one by his side, yet he could not put Zisi at ease—what was Hou Ba to Yan? Note his words: "Flatter and obey, and your neck will be severed." This rebuke to his old friend was no different from cutting ties with a senior—how could he be retained? This is the third. "The noble change friends; the rich change wives"—even the emperor does not hesitate to speak thus, and few can long maintain respect. This is the fourth. Scholars like Fan Sheng, guest stars like the Grand Historian, or a solitary Xue Juzhou—could any truly assist in governance? This is the fifth. Had he been honored with the rank of the Three Dukes, he would have been but a name on the Cloud Terrace among the worthies of an age, while his fishing terrace stands towering for ten thousand generations. Does not the *Book of Changes* say, "The noble one, when the moment is near, does not act—better to let go"? This is what Yan Ziling meant.

Lian Fan and Qing Hong of Luoyang initially pledged brotherhood unto death, and people said, "Before them were Guan and Bao; after them, Qing and Lian." At the time, Deng Rong, Governor of Longxi, respectfully invited Fan to serve as his aide. Later, Rong was impeached by the province and imprisoned. Fan then changed his name and sought to take his place as the prison warden, attending him with utmost diligence. Later, when Fan was summoned to the imperial court, Xue Han was executed for treason. None of his old friends or disciples dared approach, but Fan alone gathered his remains. When the court officials reported this, Emperor Ming flew into a rage and summoned Fan, demanding, "Xue Han conspired with Chu to rebel. You, an official of the court, do not share the heart of the dynasty—why did you bury a criminal?" Fan kowtowed and said, "I am without merit. I thought only that Han and the others had already been executed, and I could not bear the sorrow of losing a teacher." The emperor’s anger gradually subsided. "Are you a descendant of Lian Po?" he asked. "Are you related to the Right General Ai or the Grand Marshal Dan?" Fan replied, "Pou was my great-grandfather; Dan, my grandfather." The emperor said, "No wonder your resolve is so bold." He then bestowed favors upon him, and Fan’s name became renowned. Living in the border regions, he amassed vast fields and wealth, all of which he distributed to relieve his clansmen and friends.

When Emperor Suzong passed away, Fan hastened to Jingling to mourn. At the same time, Yan Lin, an aide from Lujiang, was delivering a memorial of condolence but found his horse dead on the road, unable to proceed. Fan saw him and took pity, ordering his attendants to give him a horse without a word. Lin completed his duties but did not know to whom he owed his thanks. Someone told him, "The former Governor of Shu Commandery, Lian Shudu, is known for aiding those in need. Now that you are returning from mourning the emperor, he is the one." Lin led the horse to Fan’s door, and indeed, it was he. He expressed his gratitude and returned the horse.

The record states: Histories praise Kang Fan for establishing his reputation through heroic qi. Observing how he relieved those in peril and hastened to mourn at the emperor’s tomb, his actions were sufficiently bold, and they sufficed to inspire trust and move others. When Emperor Ming grew enraged, it served only to reveal Fan’s resolve—what began as an execution ended in extended favor. Such a turn is rarely heard of in ancient or modern times.

As for the matter of the five pestles, others might also have accomplished it, so it is not recorded here.

When Emperor Huan was still the Marquis of Liyu, he studied under Zhou Fu of Ganling. Upon ascending the throne, he promoted Fu to the position of Minister. At the time, Fang Zhi, the Prefect of Henan from the same commandery, was renowned at court. The local people composed a rhyme about them: *"The world’s compass and square is Fang Bowu; by serving as teacher, Zhou Zhongjin gained his seal."*

Later, Zong Zi, the Governor of Runan, entrusted his duties to his aide Fan Pang, while Cheng Jin, the Governor of Nanyang, similarly delegated to his aide, Cen Zhi. A rhyme spread: *"The Governor of Runan is Fan Mengbo; Nanyang’s Zong Zi merely nods in approval. The Governor of Nanyang is Cen Gongxiao; Hongnong’s Cheng Jin just sits and whistles."*

These rumors reached the Imperial Academy, where over thirty thousand students—with Guo Linzhong and Jia Weijie as their leaders—joined Li Ying, Chen Fan, and Wang Chang in mutual admiration. Within the academy, they declared: *"The world’s model is Li Yuanli; fearless against the powerful is Chen Bojun; the world’s finest talent is Wang Shumao."* They spoke boldly and debated deeply, never concealing their disdain for the mighty. From the highest ministers downward, none dared face their censure, and all came to their doors in humble submission.

The record states: Mencius spoke of Yi Yin and Guan Zhong, who studied before serving as ministers. If so, why should it be strange that one gains a seal by serving as a teacher? Since Han times, when Huan Rong delved into antiquity, the so-called learning from teachers amounted to nothing more than specialized mastery of texts and phrases, never offering enlightenment or nourishment to the mind. Yet when models and standards are attributed to others, gaining a seal through teaching is deemed unremarkable. Instead of reflecting on themselves, they mock and scheme against one another, each fostering their own factions. What does this signify?

For emperors and kings, nothing surpasses learning; in learning, nothing surpasses seeking teachers. To share a heart and virtue, to trust without doubt—this is what a noble ruler deeply cherishes. To promote learning and cultivate talent, even to the extent of thirty thousand students, is a rare blessing in later ages. Yet instead of becoming a cause for praise, it became a source of division. This is because Emperor Guangwu rose through eloquence, and thus his dynasty also declined through words.

As for the rhymes, though they arose by chance, were they not perhaps the work of unseen forces? At the time, the realm’s eminent scholars were given titles: first, the Three Exemplars; then the Eight Heroes; then the Eight Guides; then the Eight Followers; and finally, the Eight Almoners—echoing the ancient Eight Yuan and Eight Kai.

The Three Exemplars were Dou Wu, Liu Shu, and Chen Fan. *Exemplars* signify those whom an age reveres. The Eight Heroes were Li Ying, Xun Yu, Du Mi, Wang Chang, Liu You, Wei Lang, Zhao Dian, and Zhu Yu. *Heroes* signify the finest of men. The Eight Guides were Guo Linzhong, Zong Ci, Ba Xiao, Xia Fu, Fan Pang, Yin Xun, Cai Yan, and Yang Lu. *Guides* signify those who lead others through virtue. The Eight Followers were Zhang Jian, Cen Shui, Liu Biao, Chen Xiang, Kong Yu, Fan Kang, Tan Fu, and Zhai Chao. *Followers* signify those who guide others to emulate their forebears. The Eight Almoners were Du Shang, Zhang Miao, Wang Kao, Liu Ru, Hu Mu Ban, Qin Zhou, Fan Xiang, and Wang Zhang. *Almoners* signify those who rescue others with their wealth.

The record states: The Eight Yuan and Eight Kai held lofty positions and noble ways, while the Guides, Almoners, Followers, and the like saw their positions reviled and their ways abandoned. Why such a vast disparity? In the Three Dynasties and before, governance flowed from one source, and worthiness was put to use. In the late ages, governance split in two, and talent became a cause for envy.

*The Rites of Zhou* states that the Grand Steward instructs the king with eight principles to govern his ministers. How could governance be divided? If one grants while another seizes, one degrades while another promotes, one spares life while another kills—even Yao and Shun could not endure a single day of this, let alone the reigns of Emperors Huan and Ling.

Schools are the wellspring of ritual and righteousness, not the domain of coercive authority. Confucius’s disciples recorded the virtues of Yan Yuan and nine others, categorizing their strengths into four disciplines. At the time, this was not seen as strange, nor did later ages find it objectionable—never did it invite disaster. If one does not hold office, one does not meddle in its affairs. If they had merely upheld ritual, righteousness, prosperity, and shame to sustain one another, then how could the names of Guides, Almoners, and Followers be deemed insignificant? How could they be deemed insignificant?

Li Ying was austere and unyielding, forming few connections. He regarded only his fellow commandery men, Xun Shu and Chen Huang, as teachers and friends. When Xun Shuang once visited him, Ying personally drove his carriage. Upon returning, Shuang rejoiced, saying, *"Today I have been driven by Lord Li!"* Such was the admiration he inspired.

At the time, Zhang Rang’s younger brother, Shuo, served as Magistrate of Yewang. Greedy and cruel, he even murdered pregnant women. Hearing of Ying’s stern authority, he feared punishment and fled back to the capital, hiding in Rang’s residence within a hollow pillar. Ying, learning of this, led his officers to break open the pillar, seize Shuo, and deliver him to the Luoyang prison. After recording his confession, Ying executed him immediately.

Rang appealed to the emperor, who summoned Ying to question why he had not sought permission before carrying out the execution. Ying replied, *"In the past, when Confucius served as Minister of Justice in Lu, he executed Shaozheng Mao within seven days. I have now held office for over ten days, and I privately feared that delay would be my fault. I did not expect to be charged with haste."* The emperor turned to Rang and said, *"This is your brother’s crime. What fault lies with the Chief of the Secretariat?"* He then dismissed Ying.

From then on, all the eunuchs of the Yellow Gates bowed in deference and held their breath, not daring to leave the palace even on their days of rest. The emperor, finding this strange, questioned them. They knelt, weeping, and replied, *"We fear the Chief of the Secretariat, Li."*

At this time, the court grew daily more disordered, its laws and disciplines collapsing into decay. Yet Ying alone upheld his moral authority, elevating himself through his reputation. Scholars fortunate enough to be received by him were said to have "ascended the Dragon Gate."

**Commentary:** Observing Ying’s shattering of pillars to bring a case to justice, his forthright words before the imperial throne—even now, his presence remains awe-inspiring, as if alive. How could those petty, lowly men not tremble and hold their breath in fear? Yet one must ask: *"Only the ruler may bestow blessings; only the ruler may wield authority."* The power of reward and punishment flows from above to below. If I seize it, the authority I wield is the authority of all under Heaven, and the blessings I grant are the blessings of all under Heaven—disseminated from the court to the realm, who could say otherwise? At that time, the emperor’s virtue failed to uphold order, and the eunuchs’ corruption followed the same path. Yet Ying alone maintained his dignity, his decisions on appointments, dismissals, and punishments bearing no relation to the court’s will. Thus, the power of reward and punishment originated from himself, no longer flowing from above to below. This allowed petty men to point fingers and fabricate accusations, mutually promoting one another, their lips and teeth intertwined. Those who did not align with them were met with ostracism. Alas! Were those who did not conform upright or wicked? Were those who were promoted and elevated right or wrong? If their wickedness went unnoticed by the emperor, and my righteousness found no recognition above, then the upright were deemed wicked, and the wicked were able to harm the upright. In such a situation, could one sit idly and fail to intervene?

The *Hexagram Pi*’s nine in the fourth place states: *"There is a command; no blame. Those who share in the blessing will be blessed."* The *Image* says: *"There is a command; no blame. The will is carried out."* Thus, a noble man would rather speak forthrightly to condemn traitors and punish rebels than arrogate to himself the power of execution, thereby distorting his peers and bringing calamity upon the good.

Fan Pang, from his youth, cultivated purity and integrity, earning the respect of his home province. He was recommended as a Filial and Incorrupt Candidate and selected for the Four Virtues of the Office of the Grand Master of Ceremonies. At the time, famine struck Ji Province, and bandits arose in swarms. Pang was appointed as an Imperial Inspector to investigate. As he mounted his carriage and took up the reins, his resolve was firm: he would purify the realm. Upon reaching the province, local officials, knowing their own corruption, fled at the mere rumor of his arrival, abandoning their seals and sashes. None of those he impeached failed to satisfy public opinion.

When the Party Proscriptions began, Emperor Huan sent the Palace Attendant Wang Fu to interrogate the accused in order. When it came to Pang’s turn, he declared: *"I have heard the words of Confucius: 'On seeing goodness, one should feel as though one cannot attain it; on seeing evil, one should recoil as though scalded by boiling water.' I sought to ensure that the good shared in purity and the wicked shared in filth—words I believed would please the governance of a king. I never imagined they would be deemed factionalism. In ancient times, following goodness brought abundant blessings; today, following goodness leads to execution. When I die, I hope to be buried beside Mount Shouyang, so that above, I do not betray Heaven, and below, I do not shame Boyi and Shuqi."* Wang Fu, moved, altered his expression in sympathy.

**Commentary:** Observing Mengbo’s response, I cannot help but weep. Yu once said: *"The people of Yao and Shun made the hearts of Yao and Shun their own."* In that era, the Nine Ministers and Twelve Governors, modest and yielding, filled the court. All under Heaven unanimously deemed them pure. The crimes of the Four Fiends were met with exile and execution, with no leniency—all under Heaven unanimously deemed them filthy. If goodness were not pure, what value would it hold? If wickedness were not filthy, what disgrace would it bring? Even in the Spring and Autumn period, though human hearts were no longer as in ancient times, the destruction of the Three Capitals and the execution of Shaozheng Mao were pursued without reservation. Thus, it was said: *"On seeing goodness, one should feel as though one cannot attain it; on seeing evil, one should recoil as though scalded by boiling water."* Such was the people of the Three Dynasties, who walked the straight path. Alas! What misfortune to be born in Mengbo’s time! Before long, external invasions and internal strife followed in succession, disasters and misfortunes piled up, and the state teetered on the brink of ruin. Was this Heaven’s decree of doom? Or was it the fault of those who brought chaos? The bitter suffering inflicted upon the people cannot be undone.

**On the Righteousness of Friendship**

From the *Book of Jin*: Wang Pou, though poor, tilled the land himself. When his students offered to harvest his wheat, he refused to the point of abandoning the crop. Gifts from old acquaintances were all declined. Once, a disciple was conscripted for labor by the county. He came to Wang Pou, seeking a favor to intercede, but Wang Pou said: “Your learning is not enough to shield yourself, and my virtue is too meager to shelter you. What good would intercession do? Besides, I have not held a brush in forty years.” Instead, he walked alongside the student, carrying dried rice, while his son shouldered salt and fermented beans. They accompanied the disciple to the county seat on foot.

The magistrate of Anqiu, mistaking Wang Pou’s arrival for a visit to himself, straightened his robes and came out to greet him. When Wang Pou arrived, he bowed deeply and said: “My disciple has been conscripted by the county, so I have come to see him off.” Taking the student’s hand, he wept and departed. The magistrate immediately released the disciple, and the entire county regarded the incident as a disgrace.

A townsman named Guan Yan was young and talented but not yet renowned. Wang Pou alone believed he would surely rise to prominence and singled him out as a friend. Li Chun of Beihai, though young, had set his resolve and lived in austere poverty. Carrying his books, he traveled to study, and the people of his village compared him to the reemergence of Li Yuan. Wang Pou, however, saw that Li Chun’s nature was treacherous and narrow, coveting fame, and predicted he would never succeed. Later, Li Chun indeed proved unprincipled, leaving his studies unfinished. Those with discernment attributed this judgment to Wang Pou’s insight.

The record states: His refusal to accept his disciple’s plea stemmed from his initial rejection of the harvested wheat. His disregard for the Anqiu magistrate originated from his refusal to face west in a seat of honor. Otherwise, had he shown no concern for forced labor, others would have called him impractical; had he not responded to the magistrate’s formal greeting, they would have deemed him discourteous.

Though these were men renowned for their integrity and conduct, they personally undertook tasks as humble as carrying meals and bearing straw. Thus, when it is said he did not entrust, was this not in truth the deepest form of entrustment?

*The Old Book of Tang* records: When Prince Qin, Li Shimin, had pacified the realm within the seas, his ardor for classical learning and governance burned bright. He established a literary academy west of the palace, inviting scholars from all quarters to instruct and guide. There, Du Ruhui, Fang Xuanling, Yu Shinan, Chu Liang, Yao Silian, Li Daoyuan, Cai Yungong, Xue Yuanjing, Yan Xiangshi, Su Zui, Yu Zhining, Su Shichang, Xue Shou, Li Shousu, Lu Deming, Kong Yingda, Gai Wenda, and Xu Jingzong—eighteen men in all—served concurrently as academicians of the literary academy. They were divided into three shifts, taking turns to stay overnight, seizing moments between court audiences to discuss the classics and literary works, deliberating on state affairs, often until the dead of night. The emperor ordered Yan Liben to paint their portraits, and Chu Liang composed eulogies, naming them the "Eighteen Scholars." Those among the scholar-officials who were selected for this honor were said by their contemporaries to have "ascended Yingzhou." The record states: In Mencius’ time, Tao Ying asked, "If Shun were emperor and Gaoyao were judge, and Shun’s father, Gusou, committed murder, what would be done?" Wan Zhang also asked, "Xiang made killing Shun his daily occupation, yet when Shun became emperor, he enfeoffed him. Was this not done for a reason?" To prepare in advance and lodge overnight—what difficulty could there be in this? Yet with the entire realm of Tang being the achievement of Taizong, to expect him to act like Shun and refuse such measures would have been truly difficult. Alas, though many worthy men advanced together, not one among them matched the depth of Tao Ying or Wan Zhang. What they discussed in their leisure hours, what they debated until the small hours, were nothing but the snares and traps of wealth and rank, or the savory morsels of fame and merit. From this, we know that the daily conduct of great sages and worthies, and their response to the gravest shifts in human relations, is not a matter of chance but has long been firmly established. The difficulty of preparing in advance and lodging overnight was not due to impractical sentimentality but was grounded in solid, verifiable principles. How could the selection of Yingzhou scholars ever compare?

After ascending the throne, Taizong further established the Hongwen Academy, amassing over two hundred thousand volumes from the Four Categories of books. He selected the realm’s finest scholars—Yu Shinan, Chu Liang, Yao Silian, Ouyang Xun, Cai Yungong, and Xiao Deyan—appointing them as academicians while retaining their original posts. They took turns staying overnight, and during breaks in court audiences, were summoned to the inner palace to discuss the words and deeds of the ancients, deliberate on governance, examine past and present, and explore the reasons for success and failure. From dawn to dusk, they never rested for a moment. He also chose the sons and grandsons of officials of the third rank and above to serve as students of the Hongwen Academy.

The record states: When Tang conquered Xia, it cultivated civil virtue—its sagely reverence and solemnity were daily refined—yet we never hear of it establishing a Hongwen Academy. When Zhou conquered Yin, it spread civil teachings—its ethical norms were well-ordered—yet we never hear of it amassing the books of the Four Treasuries. Tang, in its rising fortune, had a ruler of surpassing talent. Had he devoted himself to sagely reverence and striven to uphold ethical norms, rather than pursuing mere oral and auditory learning, would the governance of the Zhenguan era have been merely as it was? Generally, the learning of emperors differs from that of classical scholars. Ostentation and wastefulness are the learning of classical scholars; preserving the essential and applying it broadly is the learning of emperors. Thus, these two principles are more than sufficient—what need had he for over two hundred thousand volumes?

Li Bi of Jingzhao, renowned from childhood for his talent and quick wit, was befriended by Emperor Xuanzong as an equal of the crown prince. The prince once addressed him as "Master." Later, Li Bi withdrew to live in seclusion in Yingyang. When Emperor Suzong ascended the throne, he dispatched envoys to summon him, and Li Bi presented himself at Lingwu. The emperor rejoiced greatly, riding alongside him when they went out and sharing his couch when they slept, just as in the days when he was crown prince. Matters great and small were all consulted with him, and his advice was invariably followed. Even the appointment and dismissal of generals and ministers were discussed with him. Several times, the emperor wished to appoint him as chancellor, but Li Bi firmly declined, saying, "If Your Majesty treats me as a guest and friend, I am more honored than if I were chancellor. Why should I force myself to accept?" The emperor relented.

The record states: Could Suzong not have treated Li Bi as a guest and friend? After the affair of Consort Zhang, he exonerated Prince Jianning of false charges, urged proper rites for the retired emperor, and proposed honors for meritorious ministers—his guidance and mutual refinement were truly exemplary. Had Li Bi arrived earlier, before the emperor’s accession, the scale and vision of his governance would surely not have been so hasty and crude. Alas, the emperor’s heart was not yet pure, his trust not yet steadfast. Soon after Li Bi’s return from Mount Heng, he was sent out as an observer—despite his worthiness, he ultimately could not escape later criticism. This is why, at the juncture of merit and fame, one must maintain a heart free of desire and content with itself.

When Di Renjie was a staff officer in the same prefecture as Zheng Chongzhi, Zheng’s mother was elderly and ill. Zheng was to be sent on a mission to a distant land, and Di Renjie said to him, "How can you leave your parent to bear a ten-thousand-mile sorrow?" He went to the chief administrator, Lan Renji, and offered to go in Zheng’s place. Lan Renji praised his righteousness. At the time, Lan Renji was at odds with the military administrator Li Xiaolian, but upon hearing this, they said to each other, "We should feel some shame." From then on, they treated each other as before. Di Renjie often said, "The worthiness of Lord Di is unmatched south of the Northern Dipper."

The record states: This is like the case of exchanging Liu for Liu—it is not recorded. Why record this? Zheng’s mission was unavoidable, whereas Liu’s demotion could have been avoided. Compared to the "Eight Masters" of the Yuanhe era and after, the man "south of the Northern Dipper" was indeed of a different order. This is what sets him apart.

Han Yu’s *Disquisition on the Duty of a Remonstrating Minister* asks: "Can Yang Cheng, the remonstrating minister, be considered a man of the Dao? His learning is vast and his knowledge broad; he does not seek fame among men. He practices the Way of the ancients, dwelling in the remote regions of Jin. People are drawn to his virtue, and high ministers, hearing of him, recommend him to the emperor, who appoints him remonstrating minister. Five years have passed."

He had held office for no short time, was thoroughly familiar with the successes and failures of the realm, and was treated with no small favor by the emperor—yet he had never once spoken on matters of governance. When asked about his post, he would say, "I am a remonstrating minister"; when asked about his duties, he would reply, "I know nothing of them." Could a man of the Dao truly be like this?

I have heard that those who hold office must resign if they cannot fulfill their duties, and those charged with offering counsel must resign if they cannot speak their minds. Does Yang now believe he has spoken his mind? I do not criticize him for being forthright and imposing his views on others. Only a virtuous man can accept forthright admonition—meaning he can hear it and reform accordingly.

When Pei Yanling falsely accused and drove out Lu Zhan and others, the emperor was enraged, and none dared speak. Yang then stood at the Yan Ying Pavilion and submitted a memorial, speaking with vehement indignation, citing principle for days on end. Those who heard him trembled with fear, yet Yang’s voice and expression grew only more severe. The emperor flew into a rage and ordered Yang’s punishment, but the crown prince interceded, and he was spared. Still, the emperor intended to appoint Yanling as chief minister. Yang declared, "If Yanling becomes chief minister, I will tear up the imperial edict with my own hands." It was due to Yang’s efforts that the emperor did not appoint Yanling.

It is recorded: Han Yu’s forthright speech was not mere bluntness. Friends have a duty to admonish one another for their good, and mutual discourse brings the benefit of exchange. Though others dared not speak, Han Yu did. As the *Book of Changes* says, *"A steadfast illness brings joy."* This was Han Yu’s intent—something others could not fathom.

Yang’s silence was not truly silence. Only when the harm to the court and the loss to the ruler’s virtue were so grave that no one in the world dared speak did he finally speak. As the *Book of Changes* says, *"Tying up the sack incurs no blame."* This was Yang’s intent—something others could not perceive.

Of all matters under heaven, what could be greater than appointing a chief minister? When Lu Qi brought the state to the brink of ruin, nearly toppling it, and Yanling was about to repeat his folly, it was Yang alone who prevented it. His merit extended far beyond a single man’s fate or a single matter’s resolution. Had he submitted memorials morning and night upon taking office, not only would the meaning of loyal admonition have been obscured, but the beauty of his restrained virtue would never have come to fruition. This was Ouyang’s judgment—I find no fault with it.

Xiao Yingshi and Li Hua were friends of the same examination year. At the beginning of the Tianbao era, Yingshi was appointed Secretariat Drafter, while Hua served as Surveillance Censor and gained contemporary renown. The chief minister, Li Linfu, wished to meet them, but Yingshi, observing mourning for his father, refused to call on him. Linfu went to the home of an old friend to summon him, but Yingshi retreated inside and wept at the gate, waiting. Linfu had no choice but to offer condolences before leaving, furious at Yingshi’s refusal to humble himself. After the mourning period, Yingshi was assigned as a military aide in Guangling. Pei Yaoqing, Zhang Jun, and Wei Shu—all senior officials—esteemed his talent and conduct, often recommending him as their successor. He was summoned to the Historiography Institute, but Linfu, who then wielded unchecked power, refused to yield, and Yingshi was dismissed from office.

When An Lushan grew arrogant and overbearing, Yingshi secretly told Liu Bing, "Disorder will not be long in coming." Feigning illness, he traveled to Mount Taishi and thus escaped the calamity. Throughout his life, he delighted in hearing of others’ virtues and took it upon himself to promote the next generation. Dozens of men—such as Li Yang, Li Youqing, Huangfu Ran, and Lu Wei—rose to prominence through his praise and became renowned scholars. The world acknowledged his ability to recognize talent.

He was also close friends with Yin Yin, Yan Zhenqing, Liu Fang, Lu Ju, Shao Han, and Zhao Yi. At the time, people said, "Yin, Yan, Liu, Lu, Li, Xiao, Shao, and Zhao—all maintained their friendships with integrity."

Li Hua was carefree in his youth, appearing open and unconstrained, yet inwardly cautious and respectful. He admired honesty and often emulated Ji Dan’s character. When Yang Guozhong’s nephews ran amok in the provinces, Hua impeached and investigated them without yielding, bringing order to the prefectures and counties. His literary style was refined and elegant, though lacking in grandeur and vigor. Yingshi was bold and unrestrained, and contemporaries often said Hua fell short of him, though Hua himself claimed superiority.

When Hua wrote the *Fu on the Hall of Abundant Blessings*, Yingshi remarked, "Above the *Jingfu*, below the *Lingguang*." Later, when Hua composed the *Lament for the Ancient Battlefield*, he exhausted his thoughts and revisions, then discarded the draft, mixing it among the covers of Buddhist scriptures. Some time later, Yingshi read it and praised its craftsmanship, asking who could match it. Hua replied, "With a little more refinement, you could reach this level." Yingshi was astonished and conceded.

His clansman Shao Han was also known as a successful examination candidate. Living in Yangdi, he wrote with precision and labored over his thoughts to the point of exhaustion. He often sought music from the magistrate Huangfu Zeng; whenever his thoughts ran dry, he would listen to music, and when his spirit was at ease, he would write. During An Lushan’s rebellion, his friend Zhang Xun defended Suiyang. When rumors spread that Zhang had surrendered to the rebels, Han, who had witnessed the city’s defense firsthand, wrote a biography and presented it to Emperor Suzong, clarifying Zhang’s loyalty. Scholars and friends praised him for this.

It is recorded: The world speaks of Xiao and Li as equals, but their excellence was not merely in talent and literature. Consider Xiao’s refusal to submit to Linfu, Li’s enmity with Yang Guozhong, and Han’s tireless memorials exposing Zhang Xun and Xu Yuan’s loyalty—they were paragons of integrity. In particular, Li’s *Lament for the Ancient Battlefield* survives to this day, and later generations with discernment can judge it for themselves. Yet he hid it among Buddhist scriptures to seek fame—how narrow was his vision!

The *History of the Song Dynasty* records: Zhang Zhongding and Kou Zhongmin were friends in their commoner days. Kou treated Zhang as an elder brother, often reproaching him to his face without mercy, never altering his manner despite Kou’s later rise to power. When Kou became chief minister, Zhang was then serving as military commissioner of Chengdu. He told his subordinates, "Minister Kou is a man of extraordinary talent, but his learning is somewhat lacking."

Later, when Zhang was transferred to Shanzhou, Kou, who had just returned from Chengdu, prepared an elaborate reception. As they parted at the outskirts, Kou asked, "What advice do you have for me?" Zhang slowly replied, "You must read the *Biography of Huo Guang*."

Kou Zhun did not grasp his meaning. Upon returning home, he took up *The Biography of Huo Guang* and read it. When he came to the line *"lacking learning and skill,"* he laughed and said, "This is what Director Zhang meant for me."

The compiler notes: Yong’s mockery of Kou for his lack of learning—what insight did it truly reveal? Confucius said: *"Even one with the talent and beauty of the Duke of Zhou, if arrogant and stingy, is not worth observing."* Yet Kou, though desiring others to cherish kindness toward him, was not impartial in his disregard for others. Brushing off a man’s beard in rebuke, he sorely lacked the capacity to tolerate others. At court, he flaunted his own merits; abroad, he boasted of his reputation. Where merit and fame lay, he was stirred to emotion—how could he not align with Sun Shuang’s judgment? Moreover, he curried favor with Zhu Neng’s schemes, allowing his disciples to criticize him and his friends to lament for him. That slander arose against him was hardly surprising. Had he read books to clarify principles and found contentment in self-cultivation, would his life’s deeds have culminated in the debacle of Chanyuan? After achieving success, had he withdrawn and left right and wrong unheard, the public judgment of later ages would have been no different. Yet though he could move withered bamboo in Leiyang, he could not illuminate the neglected classics of the past.

Tang Jie served as censor during the reign of Emperor Renzong. At the time, Consort Zhang’s favor eclipsed that of the empress, and her uncle, Zhang Yaozuo, was swiftly appointed to four prestigious posts: Military Commissioner of Xuanhui, and Director of the Jingling and Imperial Pastures. Tang vehemently opposed these appointments. The emperor said, *"The nominations originated from the Chancellery."* At the time, Wen Yanbo was chief minister, so Tang impeached him as well. Enraged, the emperor said, *"It is Tang Jie’s duty to discuss matters of state. But to claim that Yanbo rose to the rank of chief minister through the influence of the imperial consorts—what kind of speech is this?"* Tang was demoted to vice-prefect of Yingzhou, and Wen was removed to serve as prefect of Xuzhou. Court officials composed poems to see him off, but only Li Shizhong’s *Daizhi* composition gained wide circulation. It read:

*"A lone loyalist, self-assured, yet none stand with him,
He stands alone, daring to speak what others dare not.
Exiled from court, his body light as a leaf,
Yet his lofty name weighs heavy as a mountain through the ages.
Though he walks among the worthy, his face remains unflushed,
Before his death, the flatterers’ bones already chill.
Heaven aids our sovereign to uphold the state—
Would it let such a man never return?"*

Thus his reputation for integrity resounded throughout the realm, and when people spoke of a true censor, they invariably said, *"Tang Zifang."*

The compiler notes: Observing Zhang Liang’s deeds and Li Shizhong’s poem, we see not only a resounding reputation for integrity but also the emperor’s benevolent virtue, passed down to later generations, and the admirable righteousness of great ministers, worthy of emulation by scholar-officials. Thereafter, however, grievances like those of the carriage canopy and slanders like the *Dianlong* affair arose in succession, leading to lifelong strife. Once set upon this path, he never turned back, and the bonds of friendship, the virtue of ruler and minister, and the magnanimity of great officials were all lost.

Ouyang Xiu’s *On Factions* states in brief: *"The noble form factions through shared Dao; the petty form factions through shared profit. The petty have no true factions, for only the noble possess them. The petty covet rank and wealth, greedily pursuing material gain. When their interests align, they temporarily band together, feigning friendship. But when profit is at stake, they vie for advantage, or when gain is exhausted, they turn to mutual harm—even brothers and kin cannot be trusted. Thus it is said: the petty have no factions. The noble are not so. They uphold the Dao and justice, act with loyalty and trust, and cherish their reputation and integrity. In cultivating themselves, they benefit one another through shared Dao; in serving the state, they cooperate with a common heart, steadfast to the end. Thus it is said: only the noble have true factions. Though the noble’s factions may be many, they are never resented. Therefore, if a ruler merely dismisses the false factions of the petty and employs the true factions of the noble, the realm will be well-governed."*

The compiler notes: Ouyang’s discourse, though spanning hundreds of words, ultimately revolves around the distinction between *zhoubi* (cliques) and *hetong* (harmony). Mencius further expounded on the contrast between goodness and profit, saying: *"Those who rise at the cry of the quail and toil diligently for goodness are followers of Shun. Those who rise at the cry of the quail and toil diligently for profit are followers of Robber Zhi."* Though both are of the same kind, if a ruler delves deeply into the learning of sages and clearly discerns the difference between righteousness and profit, the distinction between noble and petty will become self-evident without need for comparison.

Emperor Renzong possessed a naturally pure and fine disposition, yet he lacked learning to guide him. Thus, he could not distinguish between right and wrong. During the Qingli and Jiayou eras, though noble men filled the court, petty men advanced in turn, preventing the governance from being purely harmonious and free of treacherous ministers like Gongdou, thus failing to achieve an era of grand harmony. After one or two successions, under Emperor Shenzong, cliques like those of Wang Anshi, Cai Que, Lü Huiqing, and others indulged in factionalism and scheming, toiling for profit—leading to great chaos. Is this discourse not as luminous as divination by tortoiseshell, a mirror of clarity for all ages?

Sima Guang and Fan Zhen were of one mind and close friends, delighting in each other’s company. During the Xining and Yuanfeng eras, when scholar-officials discussed the worthies of the realm, they invariably said, *"Junshi and Jingren."* Their moral character and refinement served as models for the age, and their judgments of right and wrong could bring honor or disgrace to the world—all acknowledged their superiority. Sima once said, *"You and I share the same aspirations in life; in death, we shall share the same biography."* No one dared to rank one above the other. Having made this pact, the survivor would later compose the other’s epitaph. Thus, Sima wrote *The Biography of Jingren*, stating: *"Lü Xianke’s foresight and Fan Jingren’s courageous resolve—these are qualities I do not possess."* For in matters of great integrity, whether employed or dismissed, the two acted in unison without prior consultation. Whether debating the establishment of an heir during Renzong’s reign, the *Pu* debate during Yingzong’s reign, or the New Policies during Shenzong’s reign, their words seemed as though spoken by one man. Sima also once remarked, *"Jingren and I are brothers—we merely have different surnames."*

When it came to debating the tuning of bells and pitch-pipes, however, they would argue back and forth, never reaching agreement in their lifetimes. Thus did the noble man come to know that the two were not merely pretending to consensus.

The record states: I observe that the single word *sincerity* determines a person’s fortune or misfortune, advancement or retreat, survival or demise. During the reigns of Xining and Yuanfeng, right and wrong in the realm were utterly confounded. Yet a hundred generations later, when men speak of Junshi and Jingren, their words distinguish black from white as clearly as if they were present—this is the power of sincerity. Where there is sincerity, there is no falsehood; action becomes vigorous and firm, centered and responsive. How could such harmony require prior consultation? Those so-called Dharma-transmitting monks and Dharma-protecting deities lack sincerity. Without sincerity, they are deluded and deviant, contrary to human reason and unsupported by the Dao of Heaven. How could they meet a good end? Thus, one pair shared the same biography in life and the same epitaph in death, and the people praise them to this day; the other pair, though their faces seemed alike, both perished on the same day, and the people have nothing to say of them.

Consider Zou Hao, Tian Di, and Tian Zhou, whose discussions were impassioned and whose integrity spurred one another on. Hao once impeached Zhang Dun for disloyalty and contempt toward the emperor, but before the verdict was returned, Liu the empress was enthroned. Zhou remarked to others, *"If Zhiwan had remained silent, I would have severed ties with him."* Later, when the matter was revisited, Dun was convicted and exiled to Xinzhou. After Hao was demoted, Zhou met him on the road. Hao wept upon seeing him, but Zhou said sternly, *"Had Zhiwan kept silent and remained in the capital, he would have died within five days from a chill that refused to sweat. Is it only beyond the mountains and seas that men can die? Do not take pride in this act—what a scholar ought to do does not end here."*

The record states: Zhou’s words are those of a man of insight. Let the noble man hold them in his heart, and then success or failure, advantage or disadvantage, life or death, honor or disgrace will not trouble his mind. Yet this is not what he desires. Beneath the vast sky, all things flourish in brightness—how could he deliberately imitate the chirp of fleas or the hum of mosquitoes? When circumstances compel it and the earthly Dao loses its tranquility, the noble man weighs only the gravity of ethical principles and the depth of the Way’s discourse, acting without ulterior motive. In the two reigns of Zhenzhe, both honored Empress Liu, yet Empress Mingsu met a proper end, while Chong’en perished by her own hand. Zhiwan’s integrity is now complete. Thus, though he died, he is not truly dead—how much less so for one who never dies? Even if Renzong had deposed Guo and enthroned Cao, it would have been the better choice, yet one cannot equate that time with this.

Master Hu Yuan of Anding lamented that since the Sui and Tang dynasties, official advancement had prized literary skill while neglecting classical learning, leading men to chase salaries with no higher aim. When he became professor of Suzhou and Huzhou, he established strict regulations and led by example. Even in the height of summer, he wore his official robes all day to meet his students, upholding the decorum between teacher and disciple. When explaining the classics, he would earnestly expound on key principles, teaching students first how to cultivate themselves before governing others. His disciples numbered in the thousands, and though they polished their writings daily, all transmitted the meaning of the classics, ensuring that reason prevailed. They trusted their teacher’s teachings and emphasized practical conduct. Later, when he became head of the Imperial Academy, scholars from all directions flocked to him, filling the school’s halls to capacity.

In Huzhou, he established the *Classic Meaning Hall* and the *Practical Affairs Hall*. The *Classic Meaning Hall* was for those of broad understanding and sound judgment. In the *Practical Affairs Hall*, each student managed one primary task and one secondary task, such as governing the people, military affairs, water conservancy, or accounting. The same system was implemented in the Imperial Academy. His disciples scattered across the land, and regardless of their intelligence, all conducted themselves with refined discipline. In their speech, demeanor, and bearing, one could recognize them as the master’s students without asking; when they spoke of their teacher, one could identify him as Master Hu without inquiry.

The record states: In recording Master Anding, we see that the teachings of the Luo River masters had not yet spread widely, while the educational methods of Suzhou and Huzhou came first. Without weariness in teaching or fatigue in learning, he combined the study of fundamental principles with practical application. In that era, the people were flourishing, the nation’s fortunes were ascendant, customs were pure, and virtue and achievement were profound—none of this occurred without the guidance of wise teachers and worthy mentors.

The two Cheng masters never wearied of instructing others, so their disciples were the most numerous. Those influenced by their teachings all became eminent scholars, among whom Liu Xun, Li Xu, Xie Liangzuo, You Zuo, Zhang Yi, Su Shai, Lü Dalin, Lü Dajun, and Yin Dun became especially renowned. Xun was mild in temperament yet dignified in bearing, never compromising his arguments or forgetting his steps. Scholars said, *"Mingdao’s harmony and simplicity were most closely approximated by Zhifu."* They also said, *"Zhifu was overflowing with vitality."* Xu had the talent and capacity for great tasks, his attainments profound and his understanding pure. His mind was vast and unconstrained, and among the disciples of Confucius, he resembled Zai Wo in his eloquence. Liangzuo was resolute and perceptive, tireless in his efforts. He followed the Chengs’ teachings daily, such as discussing *ren* in terms of vitality, *sincerity* in terms of reality, *reverence* in terms of constant vigilance, and *investigating principle* in terms of seeking truth. His insights were precise, and he directly pointed to *investigating principle* and *maintaining reverence* as the gateway to virtue—this most clearly captured Mingdao’s method of instruction.

Zuo’s character was pure, his sincerity internal yet manifest externally, his demeanor and speech refined and elegant. Initially, he and his elder brother Chun were both known for their literary and moral excellence. When Yichuan met them in the capital, he saw that their potential could lead them to the Dao and invited them to study under him. They abandoned their previous learning and devoted themselves to his teachings. Yi and Dun were contemporaries. Yi was known for his lofty insight, Dun for his steadfast conduct—both were praised by their master, who once said, *"In my later years, I have gained these two scholars."* Dajun was strong, bright, upright, and trustworthy. His actions never deviated from his heart, and his knowledge never diverged from his conduct. He modeled his aspirations on Confucius’ *shangda*, cultivated his virtue through Mencius’ *jiyi*, and disciplined his conduct with Yanzi’s *keji fuli*. His essential aim was unceasing sincerity and clarity, never wavering due to others’ discouragement, yielding to petty arguments, being swayed by power and profit, or halting when his strength was exhausted.

He bore the weight of sagely worthies with such resolve. Dalin was deeply introspective and meticulous by nature, his disposition fundamentally one of unyielding *qi*. Through cultivation, he attained this state—thus did the sages regard firmness as the mark of a true scholar. If one is firm and can eliminate the flaw of excessive rigidity, preserving the full virtue of firmness, what task could not be accomplished? Without firmness, nothing can be achieved in the end.

It is recorded: Those who transmitted the teachings of Master Cheng in the Song dynasty saw the great illumination of the Daoist learning. Among them, the most eminent required no teacher’s transmission, intuitively grasping the essence of the Dao—since the Han and Wei dynasties, only one such figure has appeared. Thereafter, Mingdao dredged its source, Yichuan gathered its streams, and Hui’an propagated its waves, their influence surging without end. Their efforts in refining human hearts, clarifying the Dao, and strengthening the roots of moral transformation, as well as in restoring the primordial *qi* of states and nations, were such that their ultimate aspiration was nothing less than restoring the flourishing age of the Three Dynasties. In this, their moral principles shone forth so brightly that few in later generations could match them.

Master Pingshan, Liu Zidan, was the son of the loyal and illustrious Lord Han. Grieving his father’s martyrdom, he withdrew to live in reclusion on Mount Wuyi, where he befriended Hu Xian and Liu Mianzhi, forming bonds of mutual understanding. All those with whom he associated were renowned scholars, yet only Zhu Xi was deemed capable of bearing great responsibility and achieving far-reaching aims. Once, while studying the *Book of Changes*, Liu attained a sudden enlightenment. He believed that to master the *Changes*, one must first study the hexagram *Fu* (Return), and so he imparted the teaching of "not straying far before returning" to Zhu Xi, urging him to keep it close for life. Later, Zhu Xi indeed became the preeminent Confucian master of his age.

Master Jixi, Hu Xian, was the nephew of Hu Anguo. From birth, he was serene and solemn, never speaking or laughing idly. Throughout his life, he sat upright in dignified composure; even in haste, he never raised his voice or showed impatience. If others offended him, he never retaliated. At the time, the teachings of the Luoyang school were banned, but Hu Xian and Liu Mianzhi sought out its texts, secretly copying and reciting them day and night. Hearing that Qiao Ding of Fuling had studied under Cheng Yi, Hu Xian traveled to receive instruction, though for a long time he gained little. Qiao Ding said, "The heart is overwhelmed by external things, so it cannot perceive the truth—only through learning can clarity be attained." Hu Xian realized: "Is this not the work of self-discipline?" From then on, he devoted himself to foundational study, seeking no recognition. Returning to Chong’an, he tilled the land to support his parents. As his followers grew in number, he taught them, treating their learning as his own. At first, those who questioned him laughed; later, they doubted; but over time, observing how he cultivated himself, served his parents, and interacted with others—every action aligning with his words—they came to admire and submit to him wholeheartedly. Zhu Xi once remarked: "I served Master Jixi the longest and gained the most from his teachings."

Master Baishui, Liu Mianzhi, studied under Qiao Ding, Liu Anshi, and Yang Shi before completing his education and returning to Chong’an. Near the outskirts, he built a thatched hut to read in, living by farming and remaining utterly detached from worldly desires. Scholars flocked to him, and he expounded the Way of the sages according to each student’s capacity. Zhu Xi’s transmission of the orthodox Dao lineage began with these three masters.

The record states: Observing Wei Zhai’s final charge to entrust his son, one sees not only the merit of transmitting the Dao and teaching but also the profound sense of reliance and belonging. For Master Hui’an was originally from Xin’an; initially, he resided in Chong’an, and later moved to Kao-t’ing, both times relying on Ziyu (Liu Ziyu) for lodging. Later, a hall was established there. This hall, alongside the Kong family’s ancestral temple in Queli, exemplifies the weight of ancient bonds—of gratitude, duty, and the reverence between teacher and disciple. How does this compare to the present age?

Among Master Hui’an’s many disciples, the most eminent were Huang Gan, Li Fan, Liu Hui, Liu Bing, Zhang Qia, Chen Chun, Li Fangzi, Huang Xie, Cai Shen, and Fu Guang. Huang Gan never set up a bed at night, nor did he loosen his belt, so resolute and earnest was his devotion. Master Hui’an married his daughter to him. When Huang Gan fell ill, he dressed in deep mourning robes and entrusted his writings to him, saying in parting: "I entrust the Dao to you; in death, I have no regrets." He then passed away. Huang Gan’s disciple, Sheng, compiled ritual texts and wrote books, lecturing and discussing the principles of the classics tirelessly day and night.

Li Fan was initially instructed in the teachings of Zengzi: "To achieve far-reaching goals, one must be steadfast, but to bear great responsibility, magnanimity is essential." Thus, he named his study *Hong* (Magnanimity). Whenever students failed to grasp a concept, he first directed them to consult Li Fan. Once they had some insight, he would then guide and reconcile their understanding. The students held him in awe and reverence. It was said: "Li Fan’s progress in learning is formidable, and his conduct is never careless." Others remarked: "He who will carry on this Dao must be you." Li Fan also taught: "One need not wait for official appointment or assume office to achieve great deeds. Wherever one’s abilities reach, wherever one can benefit others—that is greatness." Living at home, he lectured on the Dao, and scholars revered him.

Liu Hui elucidated the origins of Dao Learning to inspire his fellow scholars. His works, *Explanations of the* Book of Rites *and* Book of Changes, *External and Continued Medicines of Yunzhuang*, circulated widely. Liu Bing, in his studies, focused solely on expounding the Dao and clarifying principles. When Master Hui’an interpreted the *Four Books*, transmitted the *Book of Changes* and *Book of Poetry*, compiled the *Outline of the Comprehensive Mirror*, and explained the *Taiji Diagram*, Liu Bing engaged in repeated discussions and debates, refining and correcting many points. He authored *Questions on the Four Books* and *Essentials of the Outline*. In the end, he was posthumously honored as "Cultured and Tranquil," and scholars referred to him as Master Lutang.

Zhang Qia delved into the meanings of the Six Classics and their commentaries, and beyond them, he read widely among the various masters, the Hundred Schools, geographical records, and local gazetteers. Master Zhu praised his dedication, telling Huang Gan: "The hope for the enduring transmission of this Dao rests with a few gentlemen like him." From youth, Zhang Qia devoted himself to reverence. In daily life, he appeared no different from ordinary people, but when duty called, his courage was unshakable. His works, *Collected Commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals* and *Chronological Tables of Geographical Changes*, circulated in the world.

Chen Chun, in his youth, studied for the imperial examinations. Lin Zongchen saw him and marveled, saying: "This is no path for a sage’s work." He then gave Chen Chun the *Reflections on Things at Hand*, and Chen Chun abandoned his previous studies to pursue this learning. When Master Hui’an arrived in Zhangzhou, Chen Chun sought his instruction and redoubled his efforts. Master Hui’an said: "Since coming south, I have been glad to have found Chen Chun." After Chen Chun’s death, Master Hui’an often reminisced about him. Chen Chun rigorously disciplined himself, reading every book and investigating every thing. Through daily accumulation, the principles became interconnected, and he perceived their order with clarity. Humble and retiring, he maintained his integrity, and his reputation spread throughout the land.

When the fox-fur robe was new, its steward said: "A new carriage brings comfort, a well-fed horse runs swift, and a fox-fur robe keeps one warm—my lord ought to replace it." Viscount Jian replied: "When a noble person wears fine garments, their demeanor grows more reverent; when a petty person does so, their manner grows more insolent."

Zigong asked Zishi: "Why not study the *Odes*?" Zishi answered: "My parents demand my filial piety, my brothers demand my fraternal duty, and my friends demand my trustworthiness—when would I find time to study?" Zigong said: "To neglect the *Odes* is to forgo learning from them."

In the fourth year of the *Heping* era, the Director of Waterways and Remonstrating Counselor Liu Xiang memorialized: "The more lofty the melody, the fewer who can harmonize with it. Water may bear the boat, yet it can also capsize it."

The Master of Chuqiu, at seventy years of age, donned a fur robe to meet Lord Mengchang. The lord said: "You are advanced in years, Master—what instruction can you offer me?" The Master replied: "If you wished me to chase chariots, spur horses, pursue stags, or wrestle tigers, I would be dead by now—what time would I have to be old? But if you seek to resolve doubts, settle indecision, then I am still young—what does age matter?" Lord Mengchang’s face flushed with shame.

The King of Wei desired to build the Terrace of Central Heaven, declaring: "Whoever dares remonstrate shall die." Xu Wencai feigned madness, took up a basket, and entered, saying: "I hear Your Majesty plans to construct the Terrace of Central Heaven—I wish to offer my strength." He continued: "I have heard that Heaven is fifteen thousand *li* from Earth; if Your Majesty builds halfway, the terrace should rise seven thousand five hundred *li*. Its base would need to span eight thousand *li*, yet all the land in your kingdom would not suffice for its foundation. You would have to raise troops to conquer the feudal lords, seize all their lands, and even then it would not be enough. You would still need to attack the Western Yi to secure the rest. Then, gather timber and laborers—only then could it be built." The King of Wei fell silent and later abandoned the project.

Someone sent fish to the Chancellor of Zheng, who refused them. The man asked: "You love fish—why not accept them?" The Chancellor replied: "It is because I love fish that I do not accept them. If I took the fish, I would lose my salary and have no means to eat fish. By refusing the fish, I keep my salary and may eat fish all my life."

"Rely on the wisdom of the old and the decisiveness of the young, and Alu will surely be well governed." When Ziqi was sixteen, the Lord of Qi sent him to administer Alu. Soon after, the lord regretted his decision and dispatched an envoy to recall him. As the envoy reached the city gates, he saw that Ziqi had already begun governing, and all those riding with him in the carriage were white-haired elders. Upon arriving in Alu, Ziqi melted down the armory’s weapons to forge farming tools. The state of Wei remarked: "We hear a mere boy governs the city—its armories are empty, its granaries bare." They then raised troops to attack. The people of Alu, fathers leading sons and elder brothers leading younger brothers, fought with their own weapons and defeated the Wei forces.

*The Model Sayings* in fifteen fascicles, composed by Yang Xiong, with commentary by Li Gui and Hong Fan.

"To devote oneself to learning is not as good as devoting oneself to seeking a teacher. A teacher is the model for all people."

Those with a semblance of Yan’s countenance are still followers of Yan; horses resembling the swift Ji are still steeds of Ji’s breed.

The *fu* of the *Shi* poets are resplendent yet measured; the *fu* of mere rhetoricians are resplendent yet frivolous. Were the disciples of Confucius to employ *fu*, Jia Yi would ascend the hall, while Sima Xiangru would enter the inner chamber.

What are the Four Weighty Matters?
The Four Weighty Matters are: weighty speech possesses method, weighty conduct possesses virtue, weighty demeanor possesses dignity, and weighty preferences possess refinement.

What are the Four Frivolous Matters?
The Four Frivolous Matters are: frivolous speech invites sorrow, frivolous conduct invites guilt, frivolous demeanor invites disgrace, and frivolous preferences invite baseness.

If a blade is dull and a brush blunt, they must be sharpened and honed.

If Heaven could be measured, its capacity to cover all things would be shallow; if Earth could be fathomed, its capacity to bear all things would be meager.

Of those who expound Heaven, none are more eloquent than the *Book of Changes*; of those who expound Earth, none are more eloquent than the *Book of Documents*; of those who expound the body, none are more eloquent than the *Book of Songs*; of those who expound principle, none are more eloquent than the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.

Confucius was an exile from the state of Lu; Boyi and Shuqi were starving recluses of West Mountain. Yet they did not bend their resolve, did not disgrace their persons, and stood neither with the base nor the compliant, transcending all distinctions of right and wrong.

The Dao of Confucius is like the four great rivers flowing through the Central States, ultimately emptying into the vast sea.

*The Canon of Supreme Mystery* in ten fascicles, composed by Yang Xiong, with commentary by Yu Fan.

Eagles gather in the forest; otters enter the dry springs.

The turtledove dwells in the woods, deriding the flock of birds.

King An of Huainan was rich in florid words but poor in substance.

The hegemony of Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin endured as if continuing the moon’s light.

Confucius was sufficient in culture; Lord Lao was sufficient in mystery.

Mountains, rivers, marshes, and wetlands—all things return to them.

When the noble person attains office, they flourish; when they lose it, they remain steadfast. When the petty person attains office, they act tyrannically; when they lose it, they fall into ruin.

*New Discourses* in seventeen fascicles, by Huan Tan.

The Three Sovereigns governed through the Dao; the Five Emperors transformed through virtue; the Three Kings acted through benevolence and righteousness; the Five Hegemons employed cunning and strategy.

That which has no decrees or punishments is called Sovereign; that which has decrees but no punishments is called Emperor; that which rewards the good and punishes the evil, with feudal lords attending court, is called King; that which mobilizes troops and masses...

**Hongdao Record, Scroll Twenty-Seven: Righteousness – The Righteousness of Friends**

Master Lü Zuqian of Shulai, a sixth-generation descendant of Lü Yijian, inherited the transmission of Central Plains culture and scholarship from his family. In his youth, he studied under Lin Zhi, Wang Yingchen, and Hu Xian, and later befriended Zhang Shi and Zhu Xi. His inquiries into the Dao grew ever more refined. Once, upon reading an essay by Lu Jiuyuan, he admired it greatly but had not yet met the man. When he later presided over the Ministry of Rites examinations, he chanced upon a scroll and remarked, "This must be the work of the young Lu from Jiangxi." When the name was revealed, it proved true. All marveled at his keen discernment.

Earlier, a book titled *The Literary Sea of the Sagely Song* had appeared in bookshops. Academician Zhou Bida noted its flawed selections and feared it would not endure. He suggested entrusting the task of collation to an official scholar to compile a definitive anthology of the dynasty. Emperor Xiaozong commissioned Zuqian, who then selected works from before the Restoration, elevating the refined and rejecting the frivolous, arranging them into one hundred fifty fascicles. The emperor bestowed the title *Imperial Anthology of Our August Dynasty*.

Zuqian’s learning took the traditions of Guan and Luo as its foundation, yet he drew widely from the boundless records of the past. His mind was equanimous, his qi harmonious; he did not suppress dissent, and thus extraordinary talents of his time all turned to him in admiration. From youth, he had been impetuous, but upon reciting the *Analects* one day—holding himself to strict standards while lightly blaming others—he suddenly felt his habitual anger and irritability melt away like ice. Thus, Master Hui once remarked, "In learning, only one like Bogong can truly transform one’s temperament and nature."

His teachings and plans aimed to enlighten the world and accomplish great tasks. Even as he lay ill, his resolve to bear heavy burdens and travel far on the Way did not wane. The governance of his household became a model for later generations.

In his later years, the place where he gathered with friends was called the Lizhai Academy, located within the city of Jinhua. After his passing, the people of the prefecture immediately established a shrine in his honor.

It is recorded: Observing the learning of the Lian, Luo, Guan, and Min schools, each had its origins in our Zhejiang. After the Southern Song crossed the Yangtze, Lü Chenggong received the transmission of Central Plains scholarship and initiated this tradition. Later, scholars such as He Yu and Jin Xu emerged in succession, flourishing in their time. By the present dynasty, there were Liu Ji of Qingtian, Song Lian of Pujiang, Ye Chen of Lishui, and Zhang Yi of Longquan. The Taizu Emperor once praised the "Four Masters" without referring to them by name—how refined and flourishing! Yet Jinhua was truly the domain where Master Lü first propagated the Dao, and this cannot go unrecorded.

Master Xishan, Cai Yuanding, was born with exceptional intelligence. His father, Cai Fa, taught him the *Recorded Sayings of the Cheng Brothers* along with works such as the *Rectifying the World and Correcting Youth*. He said, "This is the true lineage of Confucius and Mencius." Yuanding deeply immersed himself in their meaning, and as he grew older, his discernment and reasoning became ever more precise. He climbed to the summit of Xishan, where he ate ferns and read books. Hearing of Zhu Xi’s reputation, he went to study under him. When Zhu Xi questioned him about his learning, he was astonished and exclaimed, "This is my old friend—he should not be ranked among my disciples." Thus, they shared a room and discussed the profound meanings of the classics, with Zhu Xi directing students from all directions to first seek Yuanding’s guidance for verification.

At that time, Han Tuozhou imposed the ban on "heterodox learning," falsely accusing the virtuous. The censors and remonstrators, following the trend, attacked them. Shen Jizu and Liu Sanjie submitted memorials denouncing Zhu Xi, implicating Yuanding as well. He was exiled to Daozhou. Upon receiving the decree, he did not plead for mercy but immediately set out on the journey. Zhu Xi and his disciples held a farewell banquet for him in a desolate temple. Some guests sighed and wept, but Zhu Xi glanced at Yuanding and saw he was no different from usual. He then sighed and said, "The affection between friends and Jitong’s unyielding resolve—both are perfectly realized." The crowd urged him to delay his departure, but Yuanding replied, "If I have offended Heaven, can I advance toward it?" Taking up his staff and sandals, he walked three thousand *li* with his son, his feet bleeding, yet without the slightest sign of distress. Upon arriving in Chunling, scholars from near and far gathered in great numbers. Students and scholars all rushed to attend his lectures. Even renowned scholars, though proud and aloof, came to pay their respects with reverence.

He read widely in all books and investigated all matters. His understanding of principle penetrated to its roots, and he was profoundly skilled in even the minutest details of charts, calligraphy, ritual, music, and institutional systems. Obscure passages and abstruse meanings in ancient texts that others could not comprehend, he grasped at a single glance. He delighted in explicating the *Four Books* and collaborated with Zhu Xi in compiling the *Commentary on the Book of Changes* and the *Outline and Details of the Comprehensive Mirror*. The *Primer* was entrusted to him for completion.

His medical prescriptions stated: "The subtleties of creation can only be recognized by those deeply versed in principle." After his death, he was eulogized in writing: "His profound insight, his outstanding talent, his unyielding resolve, his inexhaustible eloquence—these can never be seen again."

It is recorded: Mencius said, "One who wins people over through virtue is sincerely admired from the heart, as the seventy disciples admired Confucius." Thus, neither the hardships of Chen and Cai, nor the threats of the people of Kuang, nor the slander of Shusun Wushu, nor the harm intended by Sima Huan Tui could sway him. How much less could the fleeting opinions of the moment or the private judgments of others? Yet, I venture to compare this to the present, for the times are vastly different. Why is this so?

In the late Song, the hearts of the people remained steadfast, and the spirit of the scholar-officials endured, so those who resisted or obstructed were few. Thus, scholars still knew to adjust their robes and hasten to their seats, their hearts sincerely submitting in reverence and bow. Today, however, the hearts of men have grown utterly frivolous, and the scholar’s spirit has become exceedingly weak—those who mock and deride are without end. Where, then, can one go that is not a desperate strait or a dried-up rut, a path fraught with loathing and dread? Those who observe must discern this clearly.

Chen Tongfu Liang, with his surpassing talent and spirit, and his discussions that carried the wind of former worthies, was among the foremost heroes of his time, his aspirations fixed on ordering the world. In the early years of the Longxing reign, he submitted five memorials on matters high and low, but received no response. He withdrew to Yongkang, devoting himself to study and writing books. During the Chunxi era, he traveled to the capital and spoke boldly on current affairs, startling Emperor Xiaozong so deeply that he wished to display him in the court to inspire the assembled ministers. Following the precedent of Zhong Fang, he summoned Liang to the palace hall, intending to promote him. When Zeng Ji heard of this and sought to meet him, Liang, disdaining the court’s intrigues, avoided him and left. Zeng was displeased, and the high ministers, resenting his forthrightness, joined forces to obstruct him. Liang laughed and said, “I sought to lay a foundation for the state that would endure for centuries—would I stoop to barter that for a single office?” He crossed the river once more and returned home, his learning growing ever more vast.

After Mencius, he esteemed only Wang Tong. He once said of himself: “I delve into the subtleties of principle, distinguish the similarities and differences of past and present, trace the mind to its fleeting origins, and measure the body down to the finest detail. I take accumulation as my craft and self-cultivation as my norm. In meticulous scholarship and profound insight, I may indeed feel shame before the other Confucians. But when it comes to the majestic array of battle, the righteous banners unfurled, where wind and rain, clouds and thunder burst forth together, where dragons and serpents, tigers and leopards appear and vanish in transformation—overturning the wisdom and courage of an age, expanding the breadth of ten thousand generations’ minds—I dare say I possess some small advantage.” Here, he referred to Zhu Xi and Lü Zuqian.

It is recorded: In my humble observation of the principles and trends of the world, if crookedness does not reach its extreme, uprightness cannot attain its fullness. From the reigns of Guangzong and Ningzong onward, discussions of the Daoist learning were so reviled that they were nearly intolerable. The learning of rectifying the mind and making the intentions sincere was what the court wearied of hearing and warned against, while cautious and fearful teachings were dismissed as mere deceit. Men like Chen Jia, Lin Jing, Li Jingtang, Hu Tong, Shen Jizu, Liu Sanjie, He Dan, and Liu Dexiu, brandishing their slander, rolled up their sleeves in defiance, going so far as to exile and persecute the upright, scarcely a day passing without incident. The Dao had reached the point of utmost distortion. Yet how could they have known that the majestic array and righteous banners would stand firm and unshaken? In the blink of an eye, Emperor Lizong arose, venerating Daoist learning and honoring the Confucian spirit. Not only were Zhou, Cheng, Zhang, and Zhu exalted, but even Cai and Lü and the other worthies were invigorated. Only then did one realize that when clouds and thunder burst forth together, the sun and moon shine twice as bright; when serpents and tigers behave as demons, the phoenix and qilin become all the more radiant. Truly, there were those who could overturn the reckless ways of an era and expand the minds of ten thousand generations—how could Chen Tongfu’s small advantage be the only measure of this?

The *History of the Yuan* states: Master Wucao, Wu Cheng, was precociously intelligent from childhood. As he grew, he devoted himself to the learning of the sages and worthies, composing *Chapter and Verse on the Classic of Filial Piety* and collating the *Book of Changes*, *Book of Documents*, *Book of Songs*, *Spring and Autumn Annals*, *Ceremonies and Rites*, and the Greater and Lesser *Dai Records*. At the time, an imperial edict sought out worthy men, and the censor Cheng Jufu recommended him to the capital. He requested that Wu’s writings be placed in the Directorate of Education to benefit scholars. The provincial administration’s Xu Yuanmingshan, who prided himself on his literary talent, once questioned Wu about the profound meanings of the *Changes*, *Songs*, *Documents*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals*. Sighing, he said, “Speaking with you, Master, is like plumbing the depths of the ocean.” Thereafter, he treated Wu with the respect due a teacher for the rest of his life.

Left Minister Dong Shixuan invited him to his home, personally serving him meals and thread for mending, and declared, “Master, you are a scholar of the realm.” In the first year of the Zhida era, Wu was summoned to serve as Supervisor of the Directorate. Previously, when Xu Wenzheng had been Chancellor, he had begun instructing students in Master Zhu’s *Elementary Learning* and other works, but over time, these teachings gradually fell into disuse. Upon Wu’s arrival, he ordered the students to receive instruction in turn. Rising at dawn with lamps still lit, he would recite the *Wang* chapter of the *Analects* in the hall, then retire to his private quarters with utmost diligence. Those who came bearing classics to seek his counsel arrived in an unbroken stream. Adapting to each student’s aptitude, he patiently instructed and guided them, often until deep into the night, undeterred by heat or cold.

He established four principles of teaching: first, the study of the classics; second, moral conduct; third, literary arts; and fourth, governance and practical affairs. In person, he appeared so frail as to scarcely bear his robes, yet when seated upright with hands clasped, his qi flowed harmoniously and his spirit soared. His responses to questions were inexhaustible, dissolving doubts like melting ice. He once wrote in an essay: “The greatness of the Dao originates from the celestial spirits, and the sages inherit it. Before Yao and Shun, the Dao was in its primordial phase; thereafter, it flourished. The schools of Zhu, Si, Zou, and Lu represent its prosperity, while the lineages of Lian, Luo, Guan, and Min embody its fulfillment.

Examined in detail: in high antiquity, Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor marked its origin; Yao and Shun, its flourishing; Yu and Tang, its prosperity; and King Wen, King Wu, and the Duke of Zhou, its fulfillment. In the middle antiquity, Confucius established its origin; Yan [Yuan] and Zeng [zi] brought its flourishing; Zisi, its prosperity; and Mencius, its fulfillment. In recent antiquity, Master Zhou [Dunyi] initiated its origin; the Cheng brothers and Zhang [Zai] fostered its flourishing; and Master Zhu [Xi] achieved its prosperity. Who, then, shall be the fulfillment of the Dao in our age?” Such was his sense of mission toward this cultural legacy.

The record states: In my humble observation, the founding of the Yuan dynasty saw no cessation of warfare for scholarly discourse or dismounting of steeds for debate on the Dao. Only through the efforts of Masters Luzhai and Caolu—who conveyed the Way of emperors and kings to their sovereign above and the teachings of the Confucian sages to the people below—was the lifeline of the tradition extended for a century. Yet this was not a grand design to inherit the past sages and inaugurate future learning, nor did it generate a great momentum for the age. His use of the *yuan-heng-li-zhen* hexagram to illustrate the transmission of the Dao through the ages strikes me as less precise than Master Shao’s *Supreme Principles Governing the World*. Judging by the circumstances of his time, the era of Master Caolu may well have been the winter of Heaven—far from the convergence of Heaven and Earth.

From *Records of Illustrious Ministers of the August Ming*: Master Qianxi, Song Lian, in his youth studied under the local scholar Master Xiang, Academician Liu Gonguan, and Academician Huang Gongjin. In the early Hongwu reign, he was summoned from commoner status to court and appointed Librarian to the Heir Apparent, exhorting him to filial piety, brotherly love, reverence, respect, diligence, and assiduity, urging him to read widely, cultivate virtue, and refine his conduct to meet the world’s expectations. When the Taizu Emperor perused his writings, he was pleased and bestowed a letter in reply, saying: “Formerly, you instructed my son with strict discipline—this was for my sake. That you have not yet transformed customs with the methods of the sages shows your broad-mindedness. Your steadfast loyalty and frugality are entirely fitting.” During his time at court, he compiled and edited all matters pertaining to the rituals of suburban sacrifices, ancestral temples, mountains, rivers, and the spirits of the land and grain; court banquets and celebrations; rites, music, calendars, and measurements; the regulations for attire and headgear; the tributary missions of the Four Barbarians; the protocols for rewards and punishments; and the eulogies and commemorative writings for meritorious ministers and eminent officials.

When the emperor sought to appoint him to a high political post, he firmly declined, saying: “I, your servant, am young and without other talents; I have only devoted myself to literature and do not wish to hold office.” In his dealings with others, he was affable, genuine, and eager to guide younger scholars, fearing he might fail them. Those who came from afar were provided lodging and sustenance, and though they stayed long, his generosity never waned. His inner sincerity and outward forbearance were ever rooted in uprightness. He often said: “In ancient times, moral education was highly valued. Not only did disciples seek teachers, but teachers, upon finding a single talented youth to instruct, would rejoice visibly. This was no other reason than the irresistible pull of heavenly principle and human nature.”

In his later years, he took on Fang Sheng of Tiantai, whose demeanor was steadfast and unyielding to worldly concerns, whose intellect was keen and penetrating of all principles. When questioned, his writings flowed forth like water or emerged like mountains, standing out among the clamor of a hundred birds like a solitary phoenix.

The record states: Song Qianxi’s resolute refusal of high office was not without reason. For while his teaching of the heir apparent, cultivation of public morality, establishment of state institutions, and elucidation of classical texts were abundant and overflowing, his capacity for high political office was modest and insufficient—such were the demands of the times. Yet his humble demeanor in office seemed to subtly safeguard the principles of governance and human relations for another day. One can imagine that in his private discussions and teachings within his school, he never resorted to mere embellishment or ornate phrasing. Rather, his insights into the successes and failures of court politics, the fortunes of the state, the burdens of the heir apparent, and the latent crises were as clear and indelible as if carved in metal and stone. Only thus could he stand without betraying the intentions of the founding emperor—a standard that those in power at the time could not match.

Master Zhengxue, Fang Xiaoru, studied under Song Lian. He thoroughly investigated the lineages and sources of Neo-Confucian learning, the rise and fall of eminent figures, the subtleties of prosperity and decline, and the details of names, objects, measurements, and numbers, leaving no thread unexamined and synthesizing all into a grand unity. As he matured, he befriended renowned scholars such as Su Boreng and Hu Han, engaging in intense and far-reaching discussions, delving deeply into the classics and histories. From self-cultivation and family governance to statecraft and social conduct, all could serve as models. He held that the Dao is present in all affairs, and thus compiled a list of twenty exhortations to encourage improvement. He also wrote thirty-eight chapters of *Miscellaneous Admonitions* as warnings. He believed that transforming the people must begin with rectifying the family, and so composed nine essays on *Clan Regulations* to instruct his kinsmen. He further observed: “Today’s scholars, mired in the flaws of past learning, merely pilfer established doctrines to craft their writings.”

The miscellaneous scholars, though broadly learned in Buddhist teachings, possess base and debased aspirations, their discussions shallow and narrow, devoid of the demeanor of true gentlemen and noble men. Thus, he once rose with indignation and declared: “One who does not serve his lord with the heart of Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou is a traitor to his lord; one who does not study with the learning of Confucius and Mencius is a traitor to himself.” All under heaven with lofty aspirations admired his words, nearly abandoning their own studies to follow him. In his own estimation, he sought to ascend and join Boyi and Shuqi above, and descend to bow before Peng Xian, willing to die for righteousness without a backward glance.

It is recorded: What did Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou do in serving their lords? He replied: “I do not trifle with disobedience. When King Tai Jia was exiled to Tong, he proved worthy, so the Duke of Zhou restored him. As for Guan and Cai, rumors spread that the Duke of Zhou would harm the young king, but it was not the Duke of Zhou who executed them—it was the execution they deserved by all under heaven.”

What did Confucius and Mencius teach in their learning? He replied: “The scholar with resolve and the man of humanity do not seek life at the expense of humanity; they sacrifice themselves to fulfill it. As it is said: ‘Life is what I desire; righteousness is also what I desire. When what I desire surpasses life, I do not evade it for mere survival.’” Yet among the scholars of former times, how did their teachings differ from those of today? Few, however, embodied and practiced them.

Could such a man be omitted from these records? Wang Zhongwen, styled Cheng, studied alongside Song Qianxi under Liu Wensu and Huang Wenxian. Among their contemporaries, those who praised their friendship included Professor Hu Han, who said: “Bo’s prose surges forth like mountains rising from water, matching Huang’s as if from the same mold.” Hu Xingjian, the Imperial Censor of Qingjiang, remarked: “Though his roots trace back to Master Huang, his profound mastery surpasses him.” Song Qianxi himself observed: “In his youth, his works were vast in scope and grand in transformation, their brilliance dazzling among his peers. Like one constructing a great hall, he amassed abundant materials, laying a broad foundation. As he matured, his writing surged like waves where dragons leapt, and storms where rain and hail gathered; five colors vied in brightness as ten suns shone together. Like a towering pavilion already built, its pillars aligned, its eaves soaring, its grandeur ever more majestic. By forty, his prose was effortlessly refined, its structure flawless, inviting endless exploration and yielding inexhaustible depth. Like a hall of solemn depth, where ritual vessels stand to the left and zithers to the right, great scholars and noble lords, adorned in caps and jade, exchange courteous bows within, while common scholars in humble garb cannot even glimpse its reflected glory.”

Thus, his strategies flourished in the command tent, his achievements shone in governing the people, his writings served as enduring models, his Dao-learning was evident in guiding the ruler, and his loyalty and righteousness were manifest in his death. Alas, this suffices to discuss the man. Yet if judged solely by his entanglement in the Hu rebellion, his integrity would not be fully captured.

It is recorded: I observe that the Ming dynasty also arose from the Huai region, employing many refined literati, distinct from mere peddlers or butchers. Yet these were the finest of our Zhejiang, who did not favor their hometowns, nor did they, though near to Nanyang, gaze upon one another. Among them were those like Hua Chuan, who died for loyalty, and those who upheld true learning and righteousness. Compared to the likes of Sui He and Zhou Chang, how far superior they were! Tracing the cause, it was because after the great revival of Dao-learning, those who arose from humble scholars bore the legacy of culture and scholarship, vastly different from the Han dynasty’s recovery from Qin’s decay. Thus, even in the tumultuous early days of a dynasty, the aid of teachers and friends, the benefits of learned discourse and profound origins, could not be lacking.

It is recorded: Master Kangzhai, Wu Yubi, in his youth read the *Records of the Origins of the Learning of the Luo River*, and his heart yearned for the Dao. Later, upon encountering the teachings of Master Mingdao, he was deeply moved, realizing that sages and worthies could indeed be emulated. He abandoned the imperial examinations, severed worldly ties, immersed himself in the classics, and gathered his mind and spirit. He delved deeply into the principles of the Dao, regarding the world’s pursuits as beneath his aspirations, striving instead to reach the realm of sages and worthies. In his village, every action adhered to ritual propriety. Scholars from all directions sought his instruction, but he declined their gifts, excelling in enlightenment. Those who heard his words were stirred to action.

He constantly exhorted his students in four principles: One must take the sage as one’s aim; learning must take the Dao as its ultimate goal. In cultivation, one must not skip steps—first mastering the *Lesser Learning* before advancing to the *Greater Learning*. Upon completing the *Analects*, one should broadly acquire culture and restrain oneself with ritual. In the *Mencius*, one should seek the lost mind and cultivate the Four Beginnings. In the *Doctrine of the Mean*, one must be diligent in preserving, nurturing, examining, and reflecting, gradually attaining the utmost harmony. One should understand the Supreme Polarity to know the origin of human nature, and study the *Western Inscription* to grasp the essence of humanity. In the *Book of Changes*, he followed the early Cheng school and despised the novel theories of later scholars. As for the *Book of Documents*, its ancient-text versions were profound in principle, and thus could not be arbitrarily discarded.

He once lamented: “The excessive annotations in various texts obscure direct, unobstructed understanding.” Thus, he was cautious in his own writings.

In the early years of the Tianshun reign, the loyal Duke Shi Heng recommended him to the court. An emissary was dispatched bearing official summons and gifts of silk to his residence. Upon arrival, he was appointed Grand Tutor of the Eastern Palace but firmly declined the post. When summoned to an audience in the Wenhua Hall, he earnestly declined on account of his age. The Emperor Yingzong turned to his Grand Secretary Li Xian and said, “This elder is no impractical pedant—ensure he takes office.” Yet Yang Bi steadfastly refused. A record states: In observing Kangzhai’s withdrawal and engagement, one perceives an inevitability. Confucius traveled from state to state seeking an audience, and Mencius accepted patronage, yet upon hearing of the great Dao in practice or the heroic ages of the Three Dynasties, they sighed in lament. How could they not have wished to emulate Yi or Lü, enabling the sovereign to attain the beauty of self-forgetting power? Or to delight in the joy of being thrice summoned? It was not to be. What manner of man was Shi Heng? By office, he commanded troops, not the task of seeking worthies; by power, he wielded authority, not the sincerity of aligning intentions; by the times, he stood at the cusp of turmoil, not the days of tranquility; by virtue, he was aged, not suited to harmonious collaboration. Had he hesitated even briefly, disaster would have followed swiftly. Yet observe the summons and edicts: their initial sincerity and final grace, radiant and all-pervading, shone with brilliance and grandeur. For Yang Bi, such honors only deepened his glory, while office itself remained as worthless as worn-out sandals. Between sovereign and subject, between friends, all was perfectly preserved.

Master Chen Baisha of Baisha studied under Wu Kangzhai. Kangzhai often taught using the sayings of the Cheng brothers of Lu, yet Baisha found no gain in them. Returning home, he built a terrace named Yangchun, where he sat in silent reverence daily, nurturing his fundamental origin. Few saw his face. Initially, his resolve was bold and his efforts intense, nearly inducing a disorder of the heart-mind. Later, he realized his error, understanding that vigilance and awe were not one-sided admonitions. Later scholars, failing to grasp this, erred by the slightest margin. His realization came only after years of reflection. He said, “From this point onward, my heart-mind is like a horse with a bridle—whether in movement or stillness, in handling affairs or engaging with others, it is ever present, examined and balanced, never absent.” On governance, he insisted: “The world does not move without sincerity, nor is it ordered without talent. Only when talent and sincerity unite can order prevail.” To transform through teaching, one must first sit in stillness to cultivate the seeds of goodness. He said, “The purpose of learning is to hear the Dao. If it cannot be found in books, seek it in your own heart-mind. Why be burdened by external distractions? This matter demands clear perception. Without it, even daily study is but mimicry. Once this principle is grasped, the self-cultivator trusts it.” As for poetry, prose, and the like—paths of superficial cleverness—he severed and swept them all away, allowing not the slightest obstruction in his heart-mind. Only then could the seeds of goodness be nurtured, and stillness attained. With unwavering focus, his demeanor grew ever more refined, his attainment ever deeper, embodying what is called “drawing near to the numinous.” The daily practices of the common people, though unrecognized, emerged from this very source.

He once told his disciple Lin Guang: “To ‘strive unceasingly’ is merely to gather this in.” This principle is vast, without inside or outside, without before or after, reaching everywhere without pause. Once this handle is grasped, what further task remains? Past and present, the four directions and the six realms—all are threaded and gathered as one, present in every moment and place. This fills the world, as when Confucius’ disciples strolled and sang in the Apricot Altar, their joy resting in the space between forgetting and forcing. Zeng Dian’s insight was like a living craft, yet Mencius distilled it in a single breath—soaring kites and leaping fish. Without Mencius’ effort, to speak of Zeng Dian’s delight would be like recounting a dream.

Master Hu Juren of Jingzhai received the true transmission of the learning of the heart-mind from Kangzhai. Retiring, he further expanded it, aspiring to the ancients and taking the Dao as his burden. He deemed memorization and literary composition insufficient, focusing instead on the inner self, taking loyalty and trust as his foundation, seeking the lost heart-mind as his priority. He held that the sage’s learning began and ended with reverence, thus naming his studio Jingzhai. Solemn and dignified, he walked the straight path, and in his dealings with others—even in solitude or hidden moments—his vigilance only deepened. His poem read: *“In solitude, probe deeply; guard against subtle intentions. The most profound exchanges lie in this essential truth—unashamed before Heaven.”* Disciples from all directions gathered, and he built a study hall named *Liwu* (“Revering the Self”) and *Nanguo Jian* (“Southern Academy”). Later, in teaching, he often said: “First, fear not seeing the truth; second, fear interrupted effort.” Many with fine qualities aspired too high, drifting into Chan Buddhism, indulging in empty words, unaware of what it meant to preserve and examine the heart-mind. How could they reach the realm of virtue and the Dao?

He convened with Lou Yizhai of Shangrao, Luo Yifeng of Yongfeng, Zhang Shu of Nanchang, and Bai Lizhe at Guifeng in Yiyang and the Yingtiansi Temple in Yugan. His writings include the *Juye Lu* (“Record of Dwellings and Practices”) and the *Jingzhai Ji* (“Collection of Jingzhai”). He took from the *Book of Changes* the phrase *“cultivate speech and establish sincerity”* as the meaning of *juye* (“dwelling in practice”). A record states: Chen and Hu, both disciples of Kangzhai, differed in their paths—one found no gain in the sayings of the Cheng brothers of Lu, while the other attained the true learning of the heart-mind through reverence. Yet I observe in Yang Yuehu’s letter to Lin Jixi: “Baisha favored enigmatic speech. While Kangzhai often taught using established sayings, Baisha sought self-realization.” The sayings of the Cheng brothers were also their own realizations. If later scholars insist on teaching through self-realization alone, another flaw may arise. It is also said: “Baisha awakened to the Dao late, relying on simplicity for self-cultivation.”

Thus, for scholars of today who seek self-realization, what should they take as their foundation? They should take *jing* (reverence) as their foundation. What should they take as their practice? They should take *juye* (dwelling in practice) as their practice. When their perception is true and their pursuit is earnest, they need not fear failing to dwell in it with ease or to draw deeply from its resources. Having thus avoided the burden of reluctant study, they will also not fall into the errors of later generations. If they can grasp this, they will find its source wherever they turn—what more need they await?

It is asked: Does entering into discussion at once give rise to doubt? Scholars cannot afford to be unaware of this.

Master Yifeng, Luo Lun, would not let his eyes behold unseemly sights nor his ears hear unseemly sounds. He felt no shame in coarse clothing or simple food. When speaking with a son, he grounded his words in filial piety; with a minister, in loyalty. When addressing an official, he spoke of the people’s hardships. Upon seeing a virtuous person, he cherished them as if they were qilin or phoenixes; upon encountering a wicked person, he regarded them as snakes or scorpions. When he saw someone suffering from hunger, cold, or destitution, he would empty his own possessions to relieve them. In matters of righteousness, he acted with unyielding resolve. The praise or blame of others, the joy or sorrow of events, the success or failure of affairs, even his own life or death, fortune or misfortune—none of these did he consider.

Early in his career as a Hanlin Academician, when the death of Grand Secretary Li Xian occurred, the court, following precedent, ordered his immediate reinstatement. The censors and remonstrators dared not speak against it, but Luo privately advised against it and later submitted a memorial, meticulously citing the impropriety of reinstatement from ancient times to the present. He insisted that the sagely court should follow the examples of Fu Bi and Liu Qi, who had observed full mourning. Thus, Li completed his mourning period. Luo’s memorial, spanning thousands of words, was rooted entirely in the unceasing principles of Heavenly Principle and the human heart. Upon its submission, he was stripped of his office. From then on, scholars throughout the realm strove to refine themselves in emulation of him, and those who had previously relied on mere words to cultivate themselves underwent a transformation toward sincerity and integrity. By the end of Luo’s life, the practice of reinstatement during mourning had ceased entirely in the censorate and ministry.

After retiring to Mount Jinniu, he opened his doors to teach disciples, devoting himself daily to annotating the classics. His reputation spread across the land, and wherever he went, people would gather to observe him. Even military officers and vulgar officials came to respect and admire him. His associates were all the heroic scholars of the age, and when they spoke of his character, they invariably said: “Like the blue sky and the bright sun.”

It is recorded: That Luo could be a true gentleman and not a petty man was no accident. The vital *qi* of the state had been nurtured by successive sagely rulers, reaching its flourishing peak by the Chenghua era. Thus, in the earlier Kaibao era, when imperial virtue was ascendant, there was Wang Zeng, who remained unmoved by mere comforts; in the later Qingli and Yuanyou eras, there was Sima Guang, who alone refused to wear flowers. Only by being unmoved by comfort could one stand firm in the court with unyielding integrity; only by refusing to wear flowers could one pledge oneself to solitary loyalty. How rare was a figure like Luo! Though top-ranking scholars appear in every dynasty, upon reflection, few are truly exceptional. Yet Luo’s single memorial on reinstatement during mourning—rooted in loving others through virtue—stands in stark contrast to the indulgence of the present age. Is this not a refreshing breeze across the ages? His lofty office and illustrious rank were nothing compared to the unapproachable brilliance of “the blue sky and the bright sun.”

Master Fengshan, Zhang Mao, from his youth possessed lofty aspirations. In his studies and inquiries, he conducted himself with humility and sincerity. While serving at court, he associated with Luo Yifeng, Zhuang Kongyang, Huang Zhongzhao, He Kegong, Lu Keshen, Xie Yuanji, and Zheng Kexiu—all of whom admired antiquity and aspired to righteousness. With Luo’s advocacy of harmony and integrity, they mutually inspired one another, striving to guide the ruler toward the flourishing of the Tang and Yu eras. Before long, during the Lantern Festival, Zhang, along with Zhuang and Huang, jointly submitted a memorial. Its essence lay in cultivating the sagely virtue of the emperor, but it offended the throne and led to their demotion. Their reputation soared, and the capital hailed them as the “Three Gentlemen,” collectively known with Luo as the “Four Remonstrators of the Hanlin Academy.”

Zhang cultivated virtue with profound depth. His joy and anger did not show on his face, nor did grudges or resentments take root in his heart. He made no boastful claims, nor did arrogance find place in his conduct. He read widely, comprehending all matters under heaven, delving deeply into the subtleties of principle and embodying them in practice. He was tirelessly devoted to the world, never resorting to affectation. He once said: “Humans are formed from the *qi* of Heaven and Earth and endowed with the principles of Heaven and Earth. One must align one’s substance with the vastness of Heaven and Earth and one’s function with their ceaseless circulation—only then can one be called human.”

He taught that scholars must broaden their hearts and minds. For when the heart is vast, all things become interconnected. This requires the effort of investigating principle, for only then can the heart truly unite with it. Yet one must also make the heart small. This demands the work of nurturing and refining, so the heart may become small without falling into recklessness.

It is recorded: Since Kangzhai resolutely declined the role of imperial tutor, Baisha no longer took pride in his official rank, Yifeng did not cherish his top examination honors, and the names of the “Four Remonstrators of the Hanlin” and the “Three Gentlemen” became illustrious throughout the realm. Even He Jishi, hearing of their example, submitted a memorial to resign his office—what an era this was! Above, there was a benevolent and enlightened ruler; below, many ministers of true integrity. Yet how was this achieved? Precisely through the daily work of investigating principle and nurturing the self. Thus, they established hearts as vast as Heaven and Earth, unmoved by external things, and maintained their inner cultivation with meticulous care, never complacent in self-satisfaction.

Yet if one is called "reckless and arrogant," it is only because they fail to exert themselves strenuously to live up to such a name—how could others treat them with meanness? Here the compiler examines the matter in detail.

Zhang Yuanzhen’s *Epitaph for Master Chen Xuan* states: In an age of long peace, scholar-officials often lacked vigor and moral backbone. Even those who possessed some integrity frequently fell short in the work of self-discipline. Thus, their conduct lacked brilliance, and their resolve proved inconstant. But how could one find fault with Master Chen? He set his aspirations on the ancient sages and worthies, cultivating himself in quiet obscurity without seeking recognition. His learning centered on restraining the self to seek benevolence, and so he styled himself "Ke Zhai" (Restraining Studio). He read not for literary ornament but copied down maxims by hand to aid his practice. In daily life, he spoke little, yet when action was required, he acted with courage. His conduct was marked by reverent sincerity, wholly genuine. In whatever office he held, he strove to fulfill its duties; in whatever task he undertook, he gave his whole heart. He regarded personal advancement or retreat as of little consequence, caring only for the people and the state, heedless of all else. Thus, it was said of him that he possessed an unshakable moral integrity, a talent sufficient to aid the realm, and a courage that could not be suppressed. Wherever his official career took him, people were moved. When he served as inspector in Jiangxi, his reputation endures to this day. In the Southern Metropolitan Region and Henan, as educational commissioner, his earnestness inspired admiration; in Guangdong, his authority was especially relied upon. When he departed, the local gentry and scholars pressed him to stay, and afterward, they erected shrines in his honor and monuments to their longing for his return. Thus, his name filled the realm, and whether one knew him or not, when speaking of upright men of the time, all would say, "Chen so-and-so."

The compiler notes: When we speak of one whom others cannot treat with meanness, we refer to a scholar-official of Master Chen’s virtue. Though he did not rise to the highest ranks, nor did he engage in factional intrigue upon entering court, the realm recognized his impartial integrity. Consider Zhang Shoubai, a man of uprightness, loyalty, and sincerity, who lived in quiet retirement for nearly thirty years before emerging to serve. In his time, the Filial Emperor encouraged true learning and expounded the orthodox transmission. Yet merely because imperial favor flowed toward him, he was envied. Truly, men like Kangzhai and his peers cannot be lacking. Among friends, there is no duty more pressing than mutual remembrance and encouragement—thus it was to the end.

*Hongdao Record*, Volume 27, concludes.

*Hongdao Record*, Volume 28: "Rites"

**Rites of Ruler and Minister**

*The Canon of Yao* states: "Reverent, enlightened, cultured, and thoughtful, he was sincere, respectful, and able to yield." The *Record* says: No rite surpasses reverence. Yao and Shun succeeded Heaven and established the ultimate standard. The court historian, examining antiquity and rectifying terms, called it "reverent" as a means of serving Heaven; "respectful" as a means of cultivating oneself; and "yielding" as a means of bestowing upon others. In truth, it did not exceed the single word "reverence." When Yao tested Shun, consulting on affairs and examining his words, he declared, "Your achievements are complete." After three years, he said, "You shall ascend the imperial throne." Shun deferred on account of virtue and refused to succeed. The *Record* says: Great virtue and grand enterprise—do they not indeed arise from yielding? Observing the abdication of Yao and Shun, Heaven and men alike assented, and destiny was already settled, yet they persisted in yielding without cease. Later, when Shun appointed the Nine Ministers, a flourishing spirit of deference arose. In the palace halls, bows and prostrations followed one after another, as if there were no time to rest. For when superiors cherish something, inferiors will surely cherish it even more. Yet was it true that Shun avoided Yao’s son south of the Southern River? No. At the time, it was only that Shun deferred on account of virtue and refused succession. Later, those who embellished the tale fabricated this story. Now, examining the *Canon and Counsels*, the matter is perfectly clear—there is no need to transmit doubt.

The Emperor said: "Consult the Four Peaks: Is there one who can exert himself to glorify the Emperor’s undertakings, reside in the Hundred Offices, and assist in governance with beneficent planning?" They replied in unison: "Bo Yu shall serve as Minister of Works." The Emperor said: "Good. Yu, you shall regulate the waters and lands—strive diligently in this." Yu bowed and prostrated himself, deferring to Ji, Xie, and Gao Yao. The Emperor said: "Good. Go now." The *Record* says: Shun’s deference was unnamed because the imperial position cannot be named. Yu’s deference named specific individuals because the ranks of ministers can be named. For ten thousand generations, one may envision this harmonious atmosphere—not merely taking ritual deference as the foundation of the state.

The Emperor said: "Consult the Four Peaks: Is there one who can oversee my Three Rituals?" They replied in unison: "Bo Yi." The Emperor said: "Good. Bo, you shall serve as Minister of Rites. Day and night, be reverent; be upright and pure." Bo bowed and prostrated himself, deferring to Kui and Long. The Emperor said: "Good. Go and be reverent." The *Record* says: Why does it say "be upright" and "be pure"? Uprightness means not being crooked; purity means not being muddled. The sacrifices to heavenly spirits, earthly deities, human ancestors, and ghosts all have fixed and unalterable forms, ordered and unconfused. When Emperor Zhenzong of Song falsely fabricated "Heavenly Scriptures" to deceive the Supreme Emperor, even adding honorific titles to the Jade Emperor in a disorderly fashion, he turned crooked and was not upright. When Emperor Wu of Han established the Five Emperors’ Shrine, then the Great Qi Shrine, then the Earth Goddess Shrine, all杂然并兴, he was profane and disorderly, not pure. This is why the Minister of Rites, day and night, reverently served without daring to transgress.

The Emperor composed a song, saying: "Attend to Heaven’s mandate, ever timely and subtle." He sang: "Ministers rejoice! The sovereign rises! All officials flourish!" Gao Yao bowed and prostrated himself, raising his voice: "Take heed! Lead and initiate affairs, carefully observe the statutes, and be reverent! Repeatedly examine your accomplishments, and be reverent!" Then he continued the song: "The sovereign is enlightened! The ministers are excellent! All affairs are secure!" He sang again: "The sovereign is entangled and dull! The ministers are indolent! All affairs collapse!" The Emperor bowed and said: "Good. Go and be reverent." The *Record* says: In high antiquity, when the ruler was steadfast, the ministers were exalted; when the ruler employed, the ministers carried out; when the ruler bowed, the ministers prostrated—what a magnificent atmosphere! The *Book of Changes* says: "Peace: the small departs, the great arrives—auspicious and smooth." This is when Heaven and Earth unite, and all things communicate; when superiors and inferiors unite, and their aspirations align. Since the Qin dynasty, the sole aim has been to exalt the ruler and debase the minister. Thereafter, there were no records of emperors bowing, no ethos of ministers rising first, no recurrence of "be reverent." The *Book of Changes* says: "Heaven and Earth do not unite—obstruction." Its consequences could not be reformed. Alas, how lamentable!

*The Lesser Odes* contains a poem for feasting guests:
*"Oh, oh! The deer cry,*
*Eating the southernwood in the wild.*
*I have fine guests—*
*Strike the zither, blow the sheng.*
*Blow the sheng, sound the reeds,*
*Present the baskets of gifts.*
*Those who cherish me*
*Show me the proper way."*

*"Oh, oh! The deer cry,*
*Eating the mugwort in the wild.*
*I have fine guests—*
*Their virtuous fame shines brightly.*
*They observe the people without frivolity,*
*And gentlemen emulate them.*
*I have excellent wine,*
*To feast and delight my guests."*

*"Oh, oh! The deer cry,*
*Eating the licorice in the wild.*
*I have fine guests—*
*Strike the zither, pluck the qin.*
*Strike the zither, pluck the qin,*
*Harmonious and joyful, deeply so.*
*I have excellent wine,*
*To feast and gladden my guests’ hearts."*

The *Record* says: In the hexagram *Yi* (Nourishment), the sage nourishes the worthy and, together with the people, shares the celestial position, allowing them to partake of Heaven’s emoluments. In the hexagram *Xu* (Waiting), the worthy embrace their virtue, calmly awaiting the right time, nourishing their bodies with food and drink, and harmonizing their hearts with feasting and music. This was the flourishing age of high antiquity, when they could nourish and employ, delighting in the worthy to the utmost. Passed down through the ages as a grand ceremony for honoring guests, our Ming dynasty has placed particular emphasis on it. All the heroic talents and epoch-making scholars of the realm emerge from this. Yet I humbly believe that the great purport of this ode lies in ensuring that private favors do not overshadow virtue, that harmony and joy do not become excessive—not merely nourishing the body or delighting the exterior. Thus, I hope that those who preside over such matters will hold this in their hearts, expecting the scholars of the realm to emulate figures like Wang Zhen and Sima Junshi. And that the scholars themselves will also hold this in their hearts, taking today’s beginning as the start of their journey, and in the future, perhaps becoming like Mingdao and Xiuwen. Only then will they understand that the court’s nurturing of true virtue is sincere, not merely seeking private favors or petty kindnesses, nor treating people with indulgent leniency.

The Zhou king, in dispatching his envoys, declared:
*"The four steeds strain their shins,
The Zhou road winds afar.
How could I not long for home?
Yet royal affairs know no rest—
My heart is grieved with sorrow.

The four steeds strain their shins,
Neighing and wearying the piebalds.
How could I not long for home?
Yet royal affairs know no rest—
No leisure to sit or stand.

The fledglings flit and flutter,
Now flying, now alighting,
Perching amid the oaks.
Yet royal affairs know no rest—
No leisure to tend my father.

The fledglings flit and flutter,
Now flying, now pausing,
Perching amid the wolfberry.
Yet royal affairs know no rest—
No leisure to tend my mother.

I harness the four piebalds,
Urging them to swiftest speed.
How could I not long for home?
Thus I compose this song,
To express my longing for my mother."*

**Recorded Annotation:**
In my humble view, the *Four Steeds* first establishes the guiding principles of the former kings, for the realm had not yet found repose.
That *"royal affairs know no rest"* awakens the realm’s loyalty.
That *"no leisure to tend my father"* awakens the realm’s filial piety.
That *"no leisure to sit or stand"* awakens the realm’s discipline.
That *"how could I not long for home?"* awakens the realm’s righteousness.
That *"to express my longing for my mother"* awakens the realm’s compassion.
Such feasting and toasting serve to awaken the realm’s propriety.
Such recitation and chanting serve to awaken the realm’s deference.
As an ode for universal use between ruler and subject, could Heaven have done this without purpose?

If one were to see this merely as a eulogy for the toil of envoys, devoid of deeper principles, then why did the *Great Learning* begin its teachings with the three *Xiao Ya* odes? Is this its true intent—or merely a fleeting embellishment?

The Zhou king, in sending forth his envoys, declared:
*"Radiant are the blossoms,
Upon that high plain.
The travelers hasten on—
Each thought falls short of duty.

My steeds are young colts,
Their six reins sleek as silk.
Now galloping, now driving—
Everywhere I seek counsel and scrutiny.

My steeds are fine unicorns,
Their six reins smooth as thread.
Now galloping, now driving—
Everywhere I seek plans and schemes.

My steeds are piebalds,
Their six reins lustrous.
Now galloping, now driving—
Everywhere I seek measures and rules.

My steeds are matched bays,
Their six reins perfectly aligned.
Now galloping, now driving—
Everywhere I seek consultation and inquiry."*

**Recorded Annotation:**
The purport of this ode serves as the Zhou dynasty’s legal standard, the minister’s moral compass, the shared principle of ruler and subject, and the unchanging norm of past and present—not merely for dispatching envoys.
When Yao spoke of *"unceasing diligence"* and Shun of *"no leisure for repose,"* how could the humble duty of a minister ever be deemed sufficient?
Thus, Yu’s *"each thought falls short"* arose from his refusal to presume.
King Wen’s *"each thought falls short"* came from his longing for the unseen Dao.
The Duke of Zhou’s *"each thought falls short"* came from his *"pondering by day and continuing by night."*
To fall short is to remain empty; to be empty is to strive ceaselessly. From this ceaseless striving arises the thoroughness of *"everywhere I seek counsel and scrutiny."*
To seek the good is *"counsel"*; to seek talent is *"scrutiny"*; to seek affairs is *"planning"*; to seek propriety is *"measure"*; to seek kinship is *"inquiry."* Though one may feel *"each thought falls short,"* still one fears losing the way.
Thus it is said: *"Everywhere"* implies broadening inquiry widely; *"seeking"* means no good word remains hidden; *"scrutiny"* ensures no worthy talent is overlooked; *"planning"* brings bright governance and beneficent policies; *"measure"* fosters virtuous deference among lords; *"inquiry"* elevates the obscure and humble. How could these be easily attained?
Yet even with such teachings, there are those who devise schemes but do not follow them, or reject the unworthy only to reuse them—criticized as Xiaohao was. There are those with *"hearts of their own,"* leading the people to madness—rebuked as the Earl of Kuang was. Alas! Where can one find ministers who *"know no rest"* to discourse with them on the meaning of *"each thought falls short"*?

The Zhou king feasted his ministers with the five odes of *"Deer Calls,"* and the ministers, receiving his grace, sang this ode in response:
*"May Heaven secure you,
Firmly and enduringly,
Making you simple and generous—
What blessing will not be bestowed?
Making you ever more abundant—
Nothing will not flourish.

May Heaven secure you,
Making your blessings bountiful.
All is fitting and right—
Receive Heaven’s hundredfold blessings.
Bestow upon you distant fortune—
Day by day, it will not suffice.

May Heaven secure you,
So that nothing does not prosper.
Like mountains, like hills,
Like ridges, like mounds,
Like rivers flowing ceaselessly—
Nothing will not increase.

With joyful feasting and laughter,
Thus we offer filial sacrifices,
Spring and autumn rites,
To the former kings and dukes.
The lord declares: *'May you live ten thousand years without end!'
The spirits attend—
We pray for your manifold blessings.
The people are sincere—
Thus we feast and drink.
All the common folk,
Revere your virtue,
Like the moon’s waxing,
Like the sun’s rising,
Like the longevity of Southern Mountain,
Unshaken, uncollapsed,
Like the flourishing of pines and cypresses—
None will not uphold you."*

Master Yang of Guishan said: *"From 'May Heaven secure you' to the rites for the former kings, this is the progression of governance. Its effects are vast. Yet in its execution, how little effort it requires—rooted solely in sincerity."*

Herein lie the odes *"Deer Calls"* and *"Four Steeds"*, among others—songs by which the former kings feasted their assembled ministers and rewarded their envoys. Were one merely to take up these verses and sing them, would their efficacy remain? Surely the former kings’ intent ran deeper.

It is recorded: Upon reading Guishan’s discourse on rooting governance in sincerity, I cannot but straighten my robe and sigh in admiration. For only when the great Dao is practiced and all under Heaven is held in common can the *"demonstration of the Zhou’s ways"* be no empty phrase. Only when the heart that cannot bear others’ suffering is extended into governance that cannot bear others’ suffering can *"the mother’s aspirations be fulfilled"* without idle words. Only when advancing the worthy is pursued as if one might fall short and following goodness is as effortless as a turning wheel can *"the inquiries and counsels of the Zhou"* be no futile labor. Only when actions arise from the heart’s spontaneity, unforced by compulsion, can *"none be like brothers"* be no mere embellishment. Only when one *"reveres your station and delights in uprightness"* can the spirits’ heeding be no hollow ritual. Then, how could ministers who receive such bounty fail to repay it with sincerity as their foundation?

The ode declares: *"Simple yet profound, ever increasing"*—words not borrowed from convention. *"Waxing like the moon, rising like the sun, steadfast as Southern Mountain, flourishing as pines and cypresses"*—phrases not born of flattery or falsehood. To take *"peace and stability as Heaven’s blessing"* is to bind Heaven’s fate with the lord’s. To take *"longevity as the spirits’ blessing"* is to join the spirits’ *qi* with the lord’s. To take *"sincerity as the people’s blessing"* is to link the people’s governance with the lord’s. Such prayers and praises have form; such vows have measure. For ten thousand generations, none who cherish their lord with loyalty can surpass this. Truly, none but the Duke of Zhou could have composed them.

When the feudal lords presented themselves at the Son of Heaven’s court, the Son of Heaven feasted them to display benevolence and grace, singing:
*"Lush the mugwort, heavy the dew—*
*Without the sun, it will not dry.*
*Long into the night we drink,*
*Till drunk, none depart."*
And again:
*"Heavy the dew on the lush grass,*
*There where the thickets grow.*
*Long into the night we drink,*
*In the ancestral temple, offerings made."*
*"Heavy the dew on the willows and thorns,*
*Radiant and true, our lord—*
*None lack noble virtue."*
*"Tung and catalpa, their fruit hangs full.*
*Joyous and gracious, our lord—*
*None lack noble bearing."*

It is recorded: The feast of *"Lush Mugwort"* demonstrates benevolence and grace. The banquet of *"Heavy Dew"* deepens kinship—what is meant by *"the lord’s ancestral temple."* Thus it says: *"In the ancestral temple, offerings made."* The meaning of the feast is this: when ministers exhaust their strength and abilities to establish merit for the state, the lord must repay them. When ministers exhaust their strength and abilities to establish merit, the state is secure and the lord at peace.

Later, when Chen Chengzhong drank with Duke Huan and said, *"I have divined for the day, but not for the night,"* it was because the ruler failed to illuminate the upright Way to guide the people, instead indulging in palace dances and drunken songs within his chambers. Was this merely the failing of a lord? His ministers were already steeped in punishment and corruption—how could one speak of such things in the same breath?

The Son of Heaven feasts meritorious feudal lords, bestowing upon them the joy of bow and arrows. The song goes:

*"The crimson bow, how lustrous!*
*Receive it and store it away.*
*I have fine guests—*
*My heart already cherishes them.*
*The bells and drums are set—*
*In a single morning, I feast them.*

*The crimson bow, how lustrous!*
*Receive it and bear it forth.*
*I have fine guests—*
*My heart delights in them.*
*The bells and drums are set—*
*In a single morning, I honor them.*

*The crimson bow, how lustrous!*
*Receive it and treasure it.*
*I have fine guests—*
*My heart holds them dear.*
*The bells and drums are set—*
*In a single morning, I intoxicate them."*

The record states: Lü of Shulai says: *"Receive it and store it away"* speaks to its weight. The bows presented by bowmakers are kept in the royal treasury, reserved for the meritorious, never lightly bestowed upon others. *"My heart already cherishes them"* speaks to its sincerity. The heart truly desires to cherish them, not from external compulsion. *"In a single morning, I feast them"* speaks to its swiftness. The bow, a treasure of the royal treasury, is raised and bestowed in a single morning, without hesitation or reluctance.

Later generations, treating the treasury as private wealth, even bestow armory weapons upon favored courtiers—this differs from *"receive it and store it away."* Rewards and gifts, if not born of genuine esteem but coerced by circumstances, may see iron charters granted in the morning and executions by evening—this differs from *"my heart already cherishes them."* Stingy with rich rewards, causing meritorious ministers to disband, even to the point of coveting profit over one’s own children—this differs from *"in a single morning, I feast them."*

The Zhou king, when feasting guests, sang:

*"Lush is the artemisia,*
*There on the central slope.*
*Now that I see this noble one,*
*Joyful and full of grace.*

*Lush is the artemisia,*
*There on the central mound.*
*Now that I see this noble one,*
*My heart is glad.*

*Lush am I,*
*There on the central ridge.*
*Now that I see this noble one,*
*He grants me a hundred strings of cowries.*

*Gently the boat drifts,*
*Now sinking, now rising.*
*Now that I see this noble one,*
*My heart is at rest."*

The record states: The *Xiao Ya*’s *"Lush Artemisia"* is to the *Xiao Ya* what the *Da Ya*’s *"Luxuriant Are the Caltrop"* is to the *Da Ya*. The *"Deer Call"* rite, a grand ceremony for receiving guests, thus features zithers, reed pipes, and baskets of offerings. This chapter’s rite, fostering amity and joy, thus overflows with delight and exuberance. The gifts of the Duke of Shao to the feudal lords encompassed all things, hence the extravagance of chariots, horses, and fine robes. This chapter’s gifts prize benevolence and worth, thus employing the metaphor of abundant cowrie shells. As for *"gently the boat drifts,"* it is akin to *"tossing and turning in longing."* *"My heart is at rest"* echoes *"King Wen is at peace."* Can one not envision the splendor of nurturing talent in that era? The *Lesser Preface* may yet offer some insight.

When the Zhou king feasted the feudal lords, he sang:

*"Flitting, the shanghu birds,*
*Bright are their feathers.*
*All noble ones rejoice—*
*They receive Heaven’s protection.*

*Flitting, the shanghu birds,*
*Bright are their necks.*
*All noble ones rejoice—*
*They are the shield of the myriad states.*

*Shield and pillar of the realm,*
*A model for all lords.*
*Neither reckless nor remiss,*
*They receive boundless blessings.*

*With rhinoceros and ox-horn cups,*
*Fine wine, mellow and mild.*
*They are sociable, not arrogant—*
*Myriad blessings come seeking them."*

The record states: Zheng’s commentary says: *"All"* means *"everyone."* To rejoice with all under Heaven is the greatest joy. When the Son of Heaven’s commands are obeyed throughout the Four Seas, all under Heaven rejoice. When a feudal lord’s commands are obeyed within his borders, with no internal or external strife, the feudal lords rejoice. When a grandee’s commands are obeyed within his office, and his counsel is heeded above, the grandee rejoices. When a knight advances with propriety and retreats with righteousness, the knight rejoices. When commoners till the fields, plant crops, and support their parents, with no punishments visited upon them, the common people rejoice. This elucidates the meaning of *"all rejoice."* If taken merely as a turn of phrase, why not simply say *"rejoice"*? Yet the poem repeatedly uses *"all rejoice"*—this cannot be dismissed lightly.

The feudal lords, in response to the *"Shanghu"* song, sang:

*"Mandarin ducks in flight,*
*Trapped in nets, enmeshed.*
*May the noble one live ten thousand years,*
*With felicitous blessings.*

*Mandarin ducks on the weir,*
*Tucking their left wings.*
*May the noble one live ten thousand years,*
*With boundless good fortune.*

*Horses in the stable,*
*Groomed and tended.*
*May the noble one live ten thousand years,*
*With blessings everlasting.*

*Horses in the stable,*
*Curried and cared for.*
*May the noble one live ten thousand years,*
*With blessings secure."*

The record states: The *"Guan! Guan!"* of the osprey takes its meaning wholly. What does *"mandarin ducks in flight"* signify? The *"White Colt"* ode extols fine virtue—what does *"horses in the stable"* extol? The *Zhu Commentary* offers no insight; the *Lesser Preface* provides no confirmation. If we follow the preface’s claim that ancient enlightened kings engaged with all things in accordance with the Dao, then it should resemble the kite soaring to the heavens—each thing following its nature. Thus, *"trapped in nets, enmeshed"* does not mean waiting for them to grow large enough to fly before trapping them, but rather that engaging with all things follows the Dao. Yet to say that self-restraint is likened to grooming and tending horses—this is far-fetched indeed. Such interpretations cannot be forced.

When the Son of Heaven feasted the feudal lords, the feudal lords praised the Son of Heaven with this poem:

*"Fish among the waterweeds,*
*With heads so plump.*
*The king in his capital—*
*How joyful the drinking feast!*

*Fish among the waterweeds,*
*With tails so sleek.*
*The king in his capital—*
*Drinking wine, joyful indeed.*

*Fish among the waterweeds,*
*Sheltered by the reeds.*
*The king in his capital—*
*His dwelling so serene."*

The record states: This poem first says, *"The king in his capital—how joyful the drinking feast!"* and later, *"The king in his capital—his dwelling so serene."* From its words, one glimpses the atmosphere of effortless governance, perfectly aligned with the spirit of Shun’s *"reverent self-cultivation while facing south."* Otherwise, would ministers take warning and instead offer praise?

Some have said: The king cherishes his people, so the people delight in his joy, and the king in turn partakes of this joy. This is the very meaning expressed in the poem. This, too, must not be overlooked.

The Son of Heaven’s response to *"Fish among the Waterweeds"* is thus:

*"Gather the beans, gather the beans,*
*In baskets round and baskets square.*
*When lords come to court,*
*What gifts shall I bestow?*

*Though I grant them nothing,*
*There are chariots and teams of four.*
*And what more shall I give?*
*Black robes and fish-skin sashes.*

*Bubbling springs, brimming streams—*
*They gather the water celery.*
*When lords come to court,*
*Behold their banners’ sway.*

*Their banners ripple and gleam,*
*With ringing bells so clear.*
*With harnessed teams they come,*
*Where the lord alights.*

*Crimson knee-covers on their thighs,*
*Cross-gartered leggings below.*
*No sloth nor slackness in their stride—*
*Such are the Son of Heaven’s gifts.*

*Joyful are these lords,*
*For the Son of Heaven commands them.*
*Joyful are these lords,*
*As blessings and fortune renew."*

The record states: This was during King Wu’s selection of the capital at Hao—when lord and minister rejoiced together, a scene that remains vivid for ten thousand generations. *"What gifts shall I bestow?"*—how profound the ruler’s affection! *"No sloth nor slackness in their stride"*—how solemn the subjects’ reverence! Contrast this with King Hui, who later bestowed measures of gold upon Zheng only to be despised in return, or with Duke Wei of Qi, who came to court at Zhou only to be humiliated—how different from *"what gifts shall I bestow?"* or *"no sloth nor slackness in their stride!"*

When King Xuan commanded Duke Mu of Shao to pacify the Yi tribes of Huainan, the poets praised him. This is the text of the king’s decree:

*"Receive this jade libation cup,*
*With millet wine so pure.*
*Proclaim it to your ancestors,*
*And I grant you hills and fields.*

*From Zhou you take your charge,*
*From the Duke of Shao your mandate."*

The tiger-like lord bows, kowtowing—*"May the Son of Heaven live ten thousand years!"* The tiger-like lord bows, kowtowing—*"In response, I extol the king’s grace!"*
*"Compose this for the late Duke of Shao—*
*May the Son of Heaven live ten thousand autumns!"*
*"Radiant is the Son of Heaven,*
*Whose illustrious fame knows no end.*
*He displays his cultured virtue,*
*And brings harmony to these four lands."*

The Record states: *"First it says 'the tiger-like lord bows,' then again 'the tiger-like lord bows'—*after King Li of Zhou, the royal house gradually declined, until King Xuan internally reformed governance and externally repelled the Yi and Di barbarians, reviving the royal house with sudden vigor. The Sage inscribed this in the Classics. Thus, as for this Lord Shao Hu, his glory surpassed that of Duke Kang, his renown illuminated the land of Yan, and his deeds could not be erased. Yet when Sima Qian composed the *Hereditary House of Yan*, from Duke Shao downward through nine generations to Marquis Hui, the name of Shao Hu nowhere appeared. In the thirty-sixth year of King Xuan’s reign, when Marquis Li died, no record of his border-settling deeds was found. Still, this cannot be taken as conclusive. Yet when the *Preface to the Odes* lists the genealogies of the states, it again follows Sima Qian’s account. Examining the *Odes*, the *Jiang Han* section remains, but the *Preface* entirely lacks the name of Shao Hu—how is this to be explained? If only we could grasp the intent behind the Master’s editing to correct Sima Qian’s errors, it would be a blessing not merely for Shao Hu alone.

The *Analects* records the Master saying: *"To bow below is ritual propriety. Now to bow above is arrogance. Though it goes against the multitude, I follow the lower way."* The Record states: This was Confucius’ principle for serving a lord, perfectly embodying the family tradition of the tiger-like lord’s bow. After the decline of Zhou, the court audience rites fell into disuse, and the king would descend the hall to receive the feudal lords. When Duke Huan of Qi became hegemon, the Son of Heaven sent Steward Kong to bestow a jade tablet upon the Marquis of Qi, saying: *"The Son of Heaven, considering his uncle’s advanced age and accumulated labors, grants him one rank—no need to descend in obeisance."* This was no small lapse.

Our Master established the eternal standard for the relationship between ruler and minister, his brilliance rivaling sun and moon. In composing the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, every word and meaning embodied acts that defied the multitude—even the great worthies Ziyou and Zixia could not fully grasp them, let alone ordinary men. When he trod this path, it was like the distinction between heaven above and marsh below, the very means by which the noble man discerns high and low and stabilizes the people’s will—far beyond mere questions of minor compliance or defiance.

Some may ask: Then why did Duke Huan decline Steward Kong’s offer and descend in obeisance? Why does this record not mention it? The answer is that Duke Huan merely feigned it. His false benevolence, false righteousness, and false trustworthiness were but a pretense of ritual propriety. Even Steward Kong could not be deceived—how could a noble man be so misled?

The Master said: *"If one can govern the state through ritual propriety and deference, what difficulty would there be? If one cannot govern through ritual propriety and deference, what use is ritual propriety?"*

The Record states: The Master once mocked Zilu, saying: *"To govern through ritual propriety—yet his words lack deference."* Ritual propriety is the great guiding principle of statecraft, while deference arises from the single thought of humility in one’s heart, a principle of unceasing modesty. Observe how our Master, upon arriving in any state, would invariably inquire about its governance, saying it was attained through *"warmth, goodness, reverence, frugality, and deference"*—what a magnificent bearing! Without the genuine spirit of unceasing humility, no matter how many measures and arrangements one implements, it would be no more than what Steward Kong mocked: though it might be called ritual propriety at the time, the great root and essential integrity would vanish in an instant.

Consider how King Tai of the fading Yu state, upon entering the domain of the Earl of the West, witnessed such deference: plowmen yielding field boundaries, travelers yielding the road, and in his court, officers yielding to grandees, grandees yielding to ministers. These were the concrete realities of governing through ritual propriety. How could the rulers of the two states not feel themselves small and base, filled with shame and remorse, sighing without end—and what leisure would they have for conflict? Thus, over forty states came to submit upon hearing of it, and what difficulty remained?

The Master said: *"To serve one’s lord with utmost ritual propriety—others consider it sycophancy."*

The Record states: This does not refer to serving the lord of Lu. Serving the lord of Lu with utmost ritual propriety was never deemed sycophancy; rather, it concerns serving the enfeebled Zhou king. At the time, the world regarded it as commonplace, yet our Master alone defied the multitude by bowing below, lamenting that it was not even found among the Xia states. Consider his desire to preserve the starving sheep for the *Gao* sacrifice—even his disciples like Zigong disapproved. Was this not what others deemed sycophancy?

Elsewhere, he said: *"If someone were to employ me, I would restore Zhou to its eastern capital."* This, too, was not for Lu’s sake. Let the reader examine this closely.

Entering the palace gate, he bowed deeply as though there were no room for him. He did not stand in the center of the gate nor tread upon the threshold when passing the ruler’s seat. His countenance grew solemn, his steps quickened. His speech seemed halting, as if inadequate. Gathering his robes to ascend the hall, he bowed again, holding his breath as though scarcely breathing. Descending one step, his expression relaxed into ease. At the final stair, he hastened forward with wings outspread. Returning to his position, he settled with measured steps.

On auspicious months, he always wore court dress to attend court. When the ruler bestowed food, he straightened his mat and tasted it first. When granted raw meat, he cooked it and offered it in sacrifice. When given a living creature, he reared it. While dining with the ruler, he ate only after the ruler had made his offering.

If the ruler fell ill and visited him, he bound his hair, donned his court robe, and draped his sash. When summoned by the ruler’s command, he did not wait for his carriage but set out at once.

The Record states: These were Confucius’ rituals in serving the lord of Lu. The relationship between ruler and minister is founded on reverence; the rites of the court are founded on respect. This chapter, like a measure with its standard or a compass with its model, permits no deviation by a hair’s breadth nor a step’s transgression. Is this not the great boundary for all ages?

The *Family Sayings* records: Duke Ding of Lu met with the Marquis of Qi at Jiagu. Confucius, acting as steward, arrived at the meeting site and prepared an altar with three tiers of earthen steps, where they exchanged courtesies and ascended with bows. After the exchange of toasts, the Qi sent men of Lai to coerce the Duke of Lu with weapons. Confucius ascended the steps and advanced, shielding the duke, saying: “Soldiers! Our two lords meet in friendship—how dare these barbarian captives disrupt it with arms? This is not how the Marquis of Qi commands the feudal lords. The outlying tribes do not scheme against the Central States; the Yi do not disturb Hua; captives do not disrupt covenants; weapons do not initiate amity. To the spirits, this is inauspicious; to virtue, it is a breach of righteousness; to men, it is a breach of ritual. The lord would surely not allow this.” The Marquis of Qi, disconcerted, waved them away.

After a while, Qi performed the palace music, with jesters and dwarves cavorting before them. Confucius strode forward and said: “For commoners to delude and insult the feudal lords is a crime deserving execution. Let the Right Marshal swiftly carry out the punishment.” The Marquis of Qi, alarmed, showed signs of remorse.

When the Marquis of Qi prepared to hold a banquet, Confucius addressed Liang Qiu Ju, saying: “As for the old customs between Qi and Lu, I have never heard of such a thing. The affair is already concluded, and now you would feast us—this is overburdening the attendants. Moreover, sacrificial vessels do not leave the gate, and fine music is not performed in the wilds. If the feast is fully prepared, it is a waste of ritual; if it is not, it is a display of meanness. The lord’s disgrace in abandoning ritual and earning ill repute—why not reconsider?” Thus, the banquet did not take place.

The Marquis of Qi returned and reproached his ministers, saying: “Lu employs the Way of the noble man to assist its lord, while you alone have instructed me in the ways of the Yi and Di barbarians, causing me to incur offense.” Thereupon, he returned the four towns of Lu he had seized, along with the fields of Wenyang.

The Record states: Someone asked, “If Confucius had lived in the time of Duke Huan and Duke Wen, what then?” The reply: “Kingship and hegemony differ by the slightest degree.” Thus Master Cheng said: “With sincerity of heart, one may be a true king; with pretense, one may only be a hegemon. Though the two paths diverge, the difference lies solely in their beginnings.”

From today’s vantage, consider this: governing the tribes of the remote borderlands—Confucius could have done it, and so too could an ordinary man. Rejecting the jesters’ insults—Confucius could have done it, and so too could an ordinary man. Canceling the banquet—Confucius could have done it, and so too could an ordinary man. Yet when it came to his sincerity in service, he invariably employed the noble man’s Way to assist and counsel his lord. In his sincerity of planning, he invariably possessed the full preparation of civil and martial arts to manage affairs. Even in the words of covenants and assemblies, his genuine heart and substantive deeds inspired awe. From beginning to end, his conduct and bearing were wholly rooted in human sentiment and aligned with the Great Dao, never resorting to pretense.

The failure to present the bundled reeds as tribute, the pledge to attack Yuan as a demonstration of trust—such words commanded belief and obedience, leading to the return of the seized towns. All this arose from the power of sincerity, unlike Chu’s superficial compliance or Jin’s forced submission. Thus, who but a sage could have achieved this? Hence it is said: “The disciples of Confucius never spoke of the deeds of Huan and Wen.”

*Hongdao Lu*, Scroll Twenty-Eight, concludes.

*Hongdao Lu*, Scroll Twenty-Nine: “Rites.”

**The Rites of Ruler and Minister**

According to the *Records of the Grand Historian*, when Han Xin first joined Liu Bang, he frequently conversed with Chancellor Xiao He. Xiao He marveled at him and recommended him to the king, who then appointed him as grand general. When the time came to formally invest him, Xiao He said: “The king has long been careless and discourteous. If you now appoint a grand general as if summoning a child, this is precisely why Xin would leave. If you truly wish to appoint him, you must choose an auspicious day, fast and purify yourself, erect an altar, and perform the full rites—only then will it be proper.” The Han king agreed. All the generals rejoiced, each believing he would be named grand general. When the investiture took place and the command was bestowed, it was Han Xin—everyone in the army was astonished.

*Recorded*: Emperor Gaozu was not learned in letters, yet by nature he was perceptive and astute, as seen in this instance. How many times had he mocked scholars, belittled the literati, and favored fine horses, unaware of their worth? Had he slighted Xiao He’s counsel and treated the matter as child’s play, no one would have altered their view, the generals would not have submitted, and the king would not have recognized Xin’s merit. Had he acted too late, with whom could he have contended for the realm? This moment of command hinged on a single turning point. Though it did not fully embody the rites of the Three Dynasties, it was nonetheless rare for its time. Thus, it is recorded.

After the Han king became Son of Heaven, he abolished the harsh ceremonies of Qin and simplified the laws. When his ministers drank together to boast of their achievements, some became drunk and shouted wildly, even drawing swords to strike the pillars. The emperor grew increasingly displeased. Shusun Tong then advised: “The Confucians are difficult to employ in times of conquest, but they may be relied upon to preserve what has been achieved. I wish to summon the scholars of Lu and, together with my disciples, establish court rituals.” The emperor said: “Will it not be difficult?” Tong replied: “The Five Emperors had different music, and the Three Kings had distinct rites. Both were shaped by the times and the sentiments of the people. I wish to draw from ancient rites and blend them with Qin’s ceremonies.” The emperor said: “Try it, but make it easy to understand and within my capacity to perform.”

Two scholars from Lu refused to go, saying: “Now that the realm has just been pacified, the dead remain unburied, and the wounded have not yet risen. How can you establish rites and music? Rites and music arise only after a hundred years of accumulated virtue.” Shusun laughed and said: “These rustic scholars know nothing of adapting to the times.” He then proceeded west with the thirty scholars he had summoned. Together with the emperor’s attendants and over a hundred of their disciples, they practiced the rituals in the open fields beyond the capital.

*Recorded*: Observing the transition from Qin’s fall to Han’s rise, one finds these two scholars from Lu—who would say that phoenixes and unicorns are not seen in a land that upholds ritual? The standard of the Confucians is none other than the Zhou and Confucius. Confucius said: “If there were a true king, it would take a generation for benevolence to flourish.” The rites and music of the Zhou dynasty were only established after the Duke of Zhou’s efforts—truly, what is meant by “a hundred years of accumulated virtue.” Yet the institutions of the blazing Han, which did not arise from even a foot of land or the founding of a royal legacy, differ entirely from those built through accumulated merit and gradual transformation. Though Gaozu was magnanimous and broad-minded, his virtue had not yet permeated to the marrow; though he had eliminated cruelty and tyranny, his blessings had not yet reached the august heavens. Even his son, Emperor Wen, was not without misgivings, and his grandson, Emperor Guangwu, was no better equipped. The rites and music of the Han, as the two scholars lamented, were already beyond redemption.

Some critics merely sigh over Jia Yi’s pleas before the likes of Zhou Bo and Guan Ying, or the debates on literature that fell short at the court of Prince Liu De. Yet they fail to see that those summoned were men like Gongsun Hong, Ni Kuan, or Zhufu Yan—men like Gongsun Qing, Hu Sui, or Sima Qian. Had such figures been chosen by the two emperors to establish the institutions of the age, they would have done no more than follow Shusun Tong’s precedent—how could they have laid the foundation for rites and music? Thus, were these two scholars not merely the most eminent in Lu, but also the phoenixes and unicorns of the Han, never to be seen again?

When the Changle Palace was completed, the feudal lords and ministers attended court using Shusun Tong’s new rituals. At dawn, the masters of ceremonies arranged the order of entry. The palace courtyard was lined with chariots, cavalry, guards, and officials; weapons were displayed, and banners unfurled. The meritorious ministers and marquises stood in order, facing east on the western side, while the civil officials, from the chancellor downward, stood facing west on the eastern side. The grand procession was conducted with nine attendants announcing the ranks. Then the emperor emerged from the chamber, and the officials bearing halberds relayed the alert. The feudal kings and officials down to those of the two-thousand-bushel rank were led in to offer their congratulations. From the feudal kings downward, none failed to tremble with awe and reverence. When the rites were completed, all prostrated themselves. A banquet was held, and as the ministers sat in attendance, all in the hall bowed low, their heads lowered in accordance with rank. The toasts began with the most senior, and nine rounds of libations were offered. When the master of ceremonies declared the proceedings concluded, the wine officers and censors enforced the rules, removing anyone who violated the etiquette. Throughout the entire court banquet, no one dared to raise their voice or act improperly.

Emperor Gaozu rejoiced, saying: “Only today do I know the true dignity of being emperor.”

*Recorded*: The emperor once gazed upon the First Emperor of Qin and said: “A true man should be like this.” Now he praised Shusun Tong, saying: “Only today do I know the true nobility of the emperor.” Observing the grandeur of the occasion, it was indeed impressive. Yet it lacked the profound virtue of Yao and Shun, and how could it compare to the solemn trust of the Three Kings?

In the eighth year of Empress Lü, on the *jiyou* day of the ninth month, the chancellor, Lord Ping; the grand commandant, Lord Bo; the grand general, Lord Wu; the censor-in-chief, Lord Cang; the minister of the imperial clan, Lord Ying; the Marquis of Zhuxu, Lord Zhang; the Marquis of Dongmou, Lord Xing; and the superintendent of guests, Lord Jie, bowed twice and addressed the court: “The sons of the late Emperor Hui, such as Zihong, are not his true heirs and should not succeed to the ancestral temple.” They respectfully requested that the court, along with the marquises and officials of the two-thousand-bushel rank, deliberate on the matter. “The Prince of Langye is the son of the High Emperor and should be the successor. We humbly request that Your Highness ascend the throne as Son of Heaven.” The Prince of Dai replied: “To uphold the ancestral temple of the High Emperor is a weighty matter.”

"I am unworthy and insufficient for such a role. I wish to consult the King of Chu on what is appropriate."

"I dare not accept."

All the ministers prostrated themselves and firmly insisted. The Prince of Dai declined three times facing west and twice facing south. Chancellor Ping and the others all said: "We have carefully considered this: Your Highness is most fitting to uphold the ancestral temple of the High Emperor. Even all the feudal lords and the myriad people deem it proper. We, for the sake of the ancestral temple and the altars of the state, dare not be negligent. We humbly beseech Your Highness to graciously heed our plea and receive the imperial seal and tokens."

They bowed twice and presented them.

The Prince of Dai said: "The imperial kinsmen, generals, kings, and marquises all deem it fitting for me. I dare not decline."

Thereupon, he ascended the throne as Son of Heaven.

*Recorded:* Observing the rites of welcoming the Prince of Dai, one may perceive the grandeur of the Great Han’s qi. For it was Bo who welcomed the Emperor, and it was Wen who declined the throne—thus one knows that a ruler cannot be forced. Zihong remained within, while the Prince of Dai was without—thus one knows that a son cannot be merely nominal. That very night, he entered the Weiyang Palace and sat upon the front hall—thus one knows that the beginning must not be improper. Upholding the ancestral temple of the High Emperor, all the feudal lords and the myriad people deemed it proper—thus one knows that the succession must be grand. This is the principle of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.

By the time of Huo Guang, he dispatched the Minister of the Imperial Clan to welcome the great-grandson to fast at the Minister’s residence. The next day, he entered the Weiyang Palace, was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Wuyang, and later ascended the imperial throne. Even if there had been three refusals facing east and two facing south, where could they have been applied? Here, the rhetoric grew more elaborate, yet the rites became more obstructed, and the qi was even less harmonious.

After the Emperor ascended the throne, when the Marquis of Jiang, having concluded his court audience, hastened out, the Emperor treated him with great reverence, often watching him depart. The Gentleman of the Palace, Yuan Ang of Anling, admonished: "The Lü clan acted with rebellion, and the great ministers jointly executed them. At that time, the Chancellor served as Grand Commandant, holding military authority, and merely happened to achieve success. Now, if the Chancellor displays arrogance toward his lord while Your Majesty practices humility, both ruler and minister失礼. I humbly submit that this is not befitting for Your Majesty."

In the next court session, the Emperor became more solemn, and the Chancellor grew more respectful.

*Recorded:* This worthy ruler, humble and frugal, deferential in ritual—how different from Huo Guang, whose carriage jolted while Emperor Xuan felt the sting of thorns on his back! Yet it is regrettable that his minister, Yuan Ang, could not fully expand the principle of reverent yielding, instead warning against arrogance toward the ruler. Though his lord possessed the innate qualities of Yao and Shun, he could not overcome the vulgar customs of Han and Peng, ultimately suffering arrest, humiliation, and execution—was this not set in motion by Yuan Ang’s words?

Alas! With the Emperor’s utmost sincerity in governing his ministers, Bo’s long-standing gravity and reputation, such solemn respect at the outset, and yet such self-destruction in the end—how can later generations of rulers and ministers hope to remain blameless from beginning to end? It is indeed far beyond reach.

The Emperor heard that the Governor of Henan, Lord Wu, was renowned as the finest administrator in the realm and summoned him to serve as Chief Justice. Lord Wu recommended Jia Yi of Luoyang, and the Emperor summoned him to serve as an Academician. At the time, Jia Yi was just over twenty years old. The Emperor admired his eloquence and erudition, promoting him within a year to Grand Master of Palace Counsel.

Jia Yi proposed revising the calendar, changing the colors of court robes, standardizing official titles, and reviving ritual and music to establish Han institutions and reform Qin laws. The Emperor, practicing humility, had no leisure for such matters.

*Recorded:* This resembles the hexagram *Xiǎo Chù* (Small Accumulation), where the firm strength of *Qián* is restrained by the yielding compliance of *Xùn*. The Sage appended to it the words: "Dense clouds, no rain, from our western suburbs." For only when yin and yang harmonize does rain descend; just as only when superiors and inferiors cooperate do achievements come to fruition. The Emperor held the power of institution-making yet remained content with humility and inaction. Jia Yi possessed the talent for action yet was misled by his youth and reputation for causing trouble. Was this not because Heaven had not yet willed the pacification of the realm?

Yet the noble man who cultivates literary virtue—surely the enterprise of moral transformation and governance is not the work of a single morning or evening. Did Confucius not say: "Without ceasing, one has no position; ceasing is how one establishes oneself. Without ceasing, none know one; strive to be known"? Had Jia Yi embraced this principle, devoted himself to obscurity and concealment, and awaited the accumulation and gradual application of his talents, would he not have achieved great accumulation? Few sagely rulers have risen to power through military means.

Why, at just over twenty years of age, did he indulge in such bitter lamentation and self-pity, composing the *Fu on the Owl* and *Lament for Qu Yuan*? Was this not too hasty? This was his shortcoming, not something others resented.

In Jia Yi’s *Memorial on Ensuring Peace*, he wrote: "The ruler’s dignity is like a hall; the ministers are like the steps; the common people are like the ground. Thus, if the steps have nine levels, with their edges far from the ground, the hall is high. If the steps have no levels, with their edges near the ground, the hall is low. The high are difficult to climb; the low are easily overrun—this is the natural principle. Therefore, the ancient sage-kings established ranks: internally, there were dukes, ministers, and grand masters; externally, there were dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons. Then came officials, teachers, petty clerks, and finally the common people—all with clearly defined ranks, above which stood the Son of Heaven. Thus, his dignity was unattainable.

A village proverb says: 'One hesitates to throw something at a rat for fear of damaging the vessel.' This is a fine analogy. If one fears damaging the vessel when the rat is near, how much more should one fear when it comes to noble ministers near the ruler? I have heard that even fine shoes are not placed upon a pillow, and even a worn-out hat is not set upon shoes. Once a man has occupied a position of honor and favor, the Son of Heaven alters his countenance to treat him with ritual courtesy, and the people bow in reverence and awe. If he later commits an offense, it is proper to dismiss him, demote him, grant him death, or execute him. But to bind him, beat him, send him to the judicial authorities, or conscript him as a convict, with petty officials cursing and flogging him—this is hardly how one should let the masses see him."

Those of lowly status, accustomed to seeing the honored in their moment of favor, may think, *"I too could be treated thus,"*—this is hardly the way to foster reverence for the noble and esteem for the exalted. In ancient times, when high ministers were dismissed for corruption, it was not called corruption but *"lack of propriety in conduct and demeanor."* When they were removed for lewdness and debauchery, with no distinction between men and women, it was not called lewdness but *"neglect of the inner chambers."* When they were relieved for incompetence and feebleness, it was not called incompetence but *"failure in office."* The ruler established the norms of integrity, shame, ritual, and righteousness in his treatment of ministers, yet if a minister did not repay his sovereign with conduct befitting his station, he was no better than a beast. Thus, when transformation was complete and customs were settled, ministers would weigh their conduct and forget profit, uphold their integrity and submit to righteousness—such men could be entrusted with unsupervised authority or the guardianship of an orphaned heir. This was the result of fostering incorruptibility, integrity, and the practice of ritual and righteousness. To abandon this and persist in that is truly cause for long sighs.

I, Jia Yi, have noted that when the Marquis of Jiang was previously arrested and imprisoned, no crime was ever proven. Thus, I used this to admonish the emperor, who deeply accepted my words and thereafter treated his ministers with measured dignity. From then on, high ministers guilty of offenses were no longer subjected to corporal punishment.

It is recorded: Jia Yi’s words proved prescient, and the emperor took them to heart. Why not say: *"Was Wu Gong’s governance not the finest in the realm?"* Had the emperor held Wu Gong accountable for the policies previously proposed, and had those policies failed, the blame would have fallen on the one who recommended them. The court rituals of the Han were not yet so crude as this. The era was not far removed from antiquity, and those who could still discern the application of the *Rites of Zhou* were not lacking. Yet later, as dynasties changed and calendars were altered, as robes and colors diverged, the names of offices, rituals, and music of old could no longer be seen in later ages. Is this not the greatest regret of a thousand generations—and the unforgivable sin of men like Jiang and Guan?

When Jia Tujia served as Chancellor, Deng Tong was deeply favored, showered with gifts worth tens of millions, and enjoyed unparalleled imperial affection. Once, as Jia entered court, Deng stood beside the emperor, displaying insolent disrespect. Jia memorialized: *"If Your Majesty favors and honors your ministers, bestow upon them wealth and rank. But court ritual must not be neglected."* After the audience, Jia sat in his office and issued a summons ordering Deng to appear at the Chancellor’s residence, warning that failure to comply would mean execution. Deng, terrified, appealed to the emperor, who said: *"Go at once."* Deng arrived at the Chancellor’s residence, removed his cap, and prostrated himself barefoot, kowtowing in apology. Jia remained seated, offering no courtesy, and rebuked him: *"The court is the court of the High Emperor. You, a petty official, dared to jest in the palace hall—this is grave disrespect, punishable by beheading."* The clerks prepared to carry out the sentence. Deng kowtowed until his forehead bled, but Jia did not relent. The emperor, judging that the Chancellor had sufficiently humbled Deng, dispatched an envoy with the imperial tally to summon him, then sent word to Jia: *"This is my plaything; spare him."* When Deng returned, he wept before the emperor: *"The Chancellor nearly killed me."*

It is recorded: Observing Jia Tujia’s conduct, one may yet speak of the rituals of the Han court. The emperor’s favored jesters were the recipients of his arbitrary favor. Petitions flowed from their gates, and their words carried the weight of influence. Had high ministers been weak, many would have bowed before them. Yet Jia, though but a single man of upright virtue, could correct court ritual and suppress disloyal impulses. How could the emperor’s governance have remained so negligent? By the time Dong Xian usurped the position of the Three Dukes and severed the line of imperial succession, all beneath the throne willingly submitted—how could one have held fast to principle then? Though schools flourished and the *Biyong* academy stood, none could speak of ritual in that age.

During Emperor Wu’s reign, the Grand General Wei Qing was greatly favored, sometimes attending the emperor as a chamberlain. The emperor once sat on the privy to receive him. When Chancellor Hong visited the emperor in private, he sometimes did so without his cap. But when Ji An came to court, he would not appear before the emperor without his cap. Once, the emperor sat in a military tent, and Ji An approached to present a memorial. Seeing Ji, the emperor, who was not wearing his cap, retreated behind the curtain and had an attendant approve the memorial. Such was the respect and courtesy he commanded.

It is recorded: Here one sees the emperor’s innate goodness—what is called *"knowing without learning, capable without deliberation."* It was not the result of forced effort. Had he extended this heart and cultivated it, he could have served the Supreme Emperor. Alas, he could not attend to the finer details and expand upon them. Envious of Tang’s virtue, the emperor’s heart was lost. This is the common failing of the Han and Tang dynasties and beyond. How could *"sincere reverence and yielding"* not become rare and unheard of?

In the fifth year of the Yuanshuo era, an edict proclaimed: *"I have heard that the people are guided by ritual and inspired by music. Now ritual is ruined and music has collapsed—I grieve deeply. Let the ritual officials observe music and revive ritual, setting an example for the realm."* Thereupon, Chancellor Hong and others memorialized, requesting the establishment of the office of Academician, with fifty disciples exempted from corvée and supported by the Court of Sacrifices. They selected commoners aged eighteen and above, of upright bearing, to become Academicians’ disciples, studying under the Court of Sacrifices. Those who mastered even one art would be appointed as Literary Attendants. Exceptional talents would be reported by name. The emperor approved.

From then on, the ranks of dukes, ministers, and officials flourished with men of learning.

It is recorded: Early in Emperor Wu’s reign, he had once promoted Zhao Wan and Wang Zang, but when the Empress Dowager disapproved of the Ru scholars, they were dismissed. He had also summoned men of learning and talent from across the realm, but when Sima Xiangru’s rhapsodies and Dongfang Shuo’s jests prevailed, the effort stalled. Now, seeking to guide the people with ritual and set an example for the realm, this was the moment for Shen Gong’s ideals to be realized. Yet how could Hong’s establishment of Academicians’ disciples and Literary Attendants—though numerous—serve any purpose? Had Jia Yi still lived and been entrusted with his words on transforming customs and turning the realm toward the Dao, would not governance have approached perfection, surpassing even the institutions of the Taichu era?

Alas! Had the Lord of Changsha (Jia Yi) not passed away, the rise of heterodox learning might have been averted. Instead, men like Gongsun Qing and Hu Sui were left to advance their proposals, and the discourse on origins and beginnings became but a lengthy exposition.

Alas! The *Treatise on Ritual* states: When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he summoned scholars of the Ru tradition to jointly establish ceremonial norms, yet after more than a decade, nothing was accomplished. Some claimed that in ancient times, when the realm was at peace and the people harmonious and joyful, auspicious omens would arrive in abundance, and only then were customs surveyed and institutions established. Upon hearing this, the Emperor issued an edict. The Imperial Censor remarked: "Those who receive the Mandate to rule each arise from different origins, taking divergent paths yet converging upon the same end. This is to say, institutions are created in response to the people and customs are followed in their formation."

The discussants all extolled the distant past, asking what the common people could hope for. Yet the Han was but one dynasty among many—if its canonical laws were not transmitted, what would become of its descendants? Where transformation runs deep, the scope is vast; where governance is shallow, it is narrow. Could they not strive for more? Thus, in the first year of the Taichu era, the calendar was reformed, colors of attire altered, Mount Tai enfeoffed, and the rituals of ancestral temples and the hundred officials established as enduring norms, bequeathed to posterity.

The record states: In my view, the words of the Ru scholars during Emperor Wu’s reign were how misguided! The Han had endured for nearly a century by then, and the people had grown pure and honest, nearly to the point where punishments could be set aside. Even if the two Masters (Yan Hui and Min Ziqian) were to return, this would have been an opportune moment for action—why then did each man advance his own theories?

At that time, Xu Le and Ni Kuan could be said to have spoken wisely. Xu Le declared: "The sagely ruler alone perceives the source of the myriad transformations." Ni Kuan said: "The Son of Heaven establishes the ultimate mean of central harmony, unifying and governing all things with the resonance of metal and jade." Yet due to the Emperor’s many desires, these consultations dragged on for over a decade without resolution. Still, the calendar was reformed to follow the Xia system, and the errors of Qin customs were decisively corrected. From this, one may see the grandeur of his vision and strategy, which cannot be mentioned in the same breath as the petty institutions of later times.

During the reign of Emperor Xuan, the remonstrance official Wang Ji submitted a memorial: "Your Majesty, in contemplating the affairs of the age, seeks to usher in an era of Great Peace. Each time an edict is issued, the people rejoice as if reborn. In my humble reflection, this may be called the utmost benevolence, yet it cannot be deemed the foundation of governance. Rulers who aspire to order do not appear in every generation. Though the high ministers are fortunate to encounter such a time, with their words heeded and remonstrances accepted, none have yet devised a strategy to endure for ten thousand generations or elevated a brilliant ruler to the glory of the Three Dynasties. Their efforts remain confined to trivial matters—reviewing documents, adjudicating cases, and hearing lawsuits. This is not the foundation of Great Peace.

I have heard that for pacifying the realm and governing the people, nothing surpasses ritual. Thus, when a true king has not yet established new rites, he adopts those of former kings that are suitable for the present. I hope Your Majesty will expound upon the old rituals, clarify the institutions of the former kings, and guide the people of this generation into the realm of benevolence and longevity. Then how could customs fail to equal those of Cheng and Kang, or longevity fall short of that of Gaozong?"

The Emperor deemed his words impractical and grandiose, and Wang Ji soon retired on grounds of illness.

The record states: That Wang Ji’s memorial ends thus is because when the world is on the verge of order, ritual and music serve a practical purpose; when the world is in decline, they become empty formalities. Emperor Xuan’s praise for Wang Cheng, his rewards for Huang Ba, and his meticulous scrutiny of names and realities—what did these have to do with reviving old rituals and clarifying the institutions of former kings? Instead, he dismissed them as "impractical."

By the time of Emperor Cheng, when he established the *Biyong* academy, set up schools, and displayed the rituals of bowing and yielding in cap and gown, what benefit did it bring? From this, one understands that the inability to keep pace with urgent matters, while pursuing grand and distant schemes, is the true essence of a ruler’s aspiration for order. Conversely, the fuss over ritual details when the vital energy is already depleted is but the trivial pursuit of a declining age.

*The Comprehensive Mirror* records: In the fifth year of the Jianwu era, the Imperial Academy was established. When the Emperor returned to inspect it, he found the ancient models restored, rituals and music flourishing, and cultural refinements worthy of admiration.

The record states: In the fourth year of the Yuanshi era of Emperor Ping, the *Biyong* academy was also established. Yet this is not recorded. Why is that recorded here?

Emperor Guangwu was determined to revive the ancient rites, establishing schools within the court and summoning recluses from without—all things the Western Han had lacked the leisure to accomplish. Moreover, to have done so amid the chaos of war and the rampant depredations of bandits was indeed commendable. Yet the Emperor had studied in his youth with Yan Guang, and when he sought him out, he found him no ordinary man; all who knew him held him in reverence and trust. Why, then, did he not appoint him to teach at the Imperial Academy? One sovereign, one master—matched in virtue, their fellowship would have been beyond compare. Instead, he conferred upon him the post of *Lianyi* (Consultant). What manner of paragon was this to serve as the age’s teacher? In my humble view, none surpassed Yan Guang.

In the first month of the first year of the Zhanghe era of Emperor Xiaozong, Cao Bao was summoned to the Gate of Auspicious Virtue and ordered to take the twelve chapters of the *Han Rites* compiled by Ban Gu (following Shusun Tong’s model) and revise them. The Emperor admonished him: “These regulations are fragmentary and largely inconsistent with the classics. Now you must correct them according to ritual principles so they may be implemented.” Cao Bao was then sent to the Eastern Pavilion of the Southern Palace to devote himself wholeheartedly to the task. Having received the mandate, he arranged the ritual matters in order, drawing on ancient precedents and interweaving texts from the Five Classics and apocryphal prophecies. He compiled regulations for the Son of Heaven down to the common people, covering capping, marriage, auspicious and inauspicious occasions, and the full cycle of life’s rites, submitting a total of one hundred and fifty memorials. Upon Emperor He’s accession, Cao Bao composed explanatory notes for the rites, and the Emperor placed the new ritual code at the forefront of his reign.

The record states: The ritual system devised by Shusun Tong for the Han left even the noble-minded with regrets. Cao Bao, emulating him, devoted himself day and night to its refinement, clutching brush and tablets even in sleep, practicing the texts as he walked. Yet when it came to his own compositions, he again interspersed them with passages from the Five Classics and apocryphal prophecies. Thus, what he produced was not Shusun’s work but the regulations of his own age. The great origin of ritual arises from Heaven and resides in the human heart. The sages summed it up in a single phrase: “Let nothing be done without reverence.” Cao Bao, lost in deep contemplation, when his thoughts reached their zenith, forgot all else—was this not the essence of “without irreverence”? Solemn in reflection, composed in expression. Yet prophecies—prophecies cannot serve as canonical texts.

The *Old唐书·Records of Ritual and Music* states: Before the Three Dynasties, governance flowed from unity, and ritual and music permeated the realm. After the Three Dynasties, governance split in two, and ritual and music became empty names. In antiquity, palaces and carriages served as dwellings, robes and caps as attire, ritual vessels and musical instruments as tools. These were employed in suburban sacrifices, court audiences, divine worship, and the governance of the people. Seasonal gatherings facilitated court assemblies, diplomatic exchanges, and joyous interactions; archery feasts and banquets fostered communal bonds; military training and schooling united the people in shared endeavors. Even at the level of villages and fields, from weddings to funerals, all followed the rhythms of music. No aspect of the people’s lives lay outside ritual. Through these means, they were taught filial piety, compassion, fraternal duty, loyalty, trustworthiness, benevolence, and righteousness—all cultivated in their daily conduct, attire, and diet. From dawn to dusk, their every act was imbued with ritual. This was governance flowing from unity, ritual and music permeating the realm, bringing peace to all under Heaven. Through habit and practice, they unconsciously turned toward goodness, shunned wrongdoing, and formed virtuous customs.

After the fall of the Three Dynasties, the Qin altered the ancient ways. Subsequent rulers, from the Son of Heaven to the hundred officials, adopted Qin titles, ranks, state institutions, and court regalia in their entirety. Even when well-intentioned sovereigns sought reform, they could not transcend their era to restore the ways of the Three Dynasties. Constrained by contemporary customs, they made only minor adjustments, content with superficial simplicity. Their daily governance focused on documents, lawsuits, military provisions, and food supplies, declaring, “This is governance, the means to rule the people.” As for the rituals of the Three Dynasties, their forms were preserved and stored by officials, brought out only for use in suburban sacrifices and court ceremonies, called “ritual, the means to teach the people.” This was governance split in two, ritual and music reduced to empty names.

The record states: In my humble view, Master Ouyang’s discourse is the ultimate truth for all ages. The Former Kings established rituals based on their own conduct and practice, using them to distinguish high and low, settle the people’s minds, and align with the utmost principles to serve Heaven and Earth and harmonize the myriad people. Rooted in the interplay of body, mind, nature, and emotions, they established norms and forms, ensuring their application. How could such a system fail to arise from unity or lack universal reach? From the Qin onward, lacking the Heavenly virtue as its foundation and the Kingly Way as its application, rulers neglected the norms and forms. In their enactments, they knew not the proper order of precedence; in their haste, they eroded the distinctions between ruler and minister, father and son, elder and younger brother, husband and wife, leaving many virtues in shame. How then could they establish the ultimate mean and harmony, ensuring that ritual, music, punishments, and governance did not split in two? This is the divide between antiquity and the present, the origin of ritual’s flourishing and decline. Those who rule must not fail to understand this.

The *Comprehensive Mirror* records: In the first month of the first year of the Zhenguan era, the Emperor held a banquet. His ministers performed the music *Breaking Chen’s Ranks*. Taizong remarked, “I once led expeditions among the people, and this piece arose from those campaigns. Though it lacks the elegance of civil virtue, it commemorates the achievements that brought us here—I dare not forget.” Feng Deyi said, “Your Majesty pacified the realm with divine martial prowess; how could civil virtue compare?” The Emperor replied, “Quelling chaos requires martial strength; preserving order demands civil virtue. Each has its time and use. To say civil virtue falls short of martial is an overstatement.”

The record states: The Master once said, “The martial is perfectly beautiful, yet not perfectly good.” Even with martial deeds that accord with Heaven and follow the people, and the rites and music composed by the Duke of Zhou, there remains the lament that they are “not perfectly good.”

Though the Emperor had quelled the chaos of Sui, he still felt much shame in his virtue, and the beauty of his reformed governance brought only modest peace. Yet Feng Deyi flattered him, claiming rites and music fell short of governance and punishment, and martial achievements surpassed civil virtue—what was his intent? Deyi’s words were misguided, and he would be ridiculed for them through the ages.

In the seventh month of autumn in the sixth year, the Emperor feasted his close ministers in the Danxiao Hall. Changsun Wuji said, “Wang Gui and Wei Zheng were once our enemies, yet today they share this banquet.” The Emperor replied, “Zheng and Gui devoted themselves to their duties, so I employ them. Yet whenever Zheng remonstrates and I do not heed him, he falls silent—why?” Zheng answered, “When I deem a matter improper, I must admonish. If Your Majesty does not heed me yet I assent, the matter would proceed—how could I dare agree?” The Emperor said, “If you assent and then remonstrate again, what harm is there?” Zheng replied, “Long ago, Shun warned his ministers: ‘Do not feign compliance to my face, then murmur behind my back.’ If I silently assented to Your Majesty, that would be feigned compliance—how could that reflect the intent of Hou Ji and Xie in serving Shun?” The Emperor laughed heartily and said, “People say Wei Zheng is coarse and arrogant, but to me, he seems all the more charming—precisely for this reason.” Zheng rose, bowed, and thanked him, saying, “Because Your Majesty encourages me to speak, I can fully express my foolishness. Had Your Majesty rejected my words, how would I dare repeatedly offend your countenance?”

The record states: Reading the *Zhong Fu* hexagram of the *Book of Changes*, and observing the conduct of Wang Gui and Wei Zheng, I cannot but sigh in admiration. Those who conceal themselves are not vessels for bearing great burdens, yet Zheng and Gui served them—like the cry of a crane reaching the heavens, how could it last? But once they turned and changed their course, offering clarity to the clear-sighted and decisiveness to the resolute, it was as if a crane sang in the shadows and its young echoed it, or as if one said, “I have a fine office, and I share it with you.” How could they not devote themselves wholeheartedly to their duties? Had they not encountered such an enlightened ruler, they would have remained mere captives of lowly status. As the saying goes: “When one meets an enemy, some drum their chests, some cease, some weep, some sing.” Zheng could not but indulge his charm—was this not the good fortune of a noble man?

In the first month of spring in the seventh year, the Emperor feasted at the Gate of Dark Martiality, where the *Seven Virtues* and *Nine Merits* dances were performed. The former was originally called *The Prince of Qin’s Victory over Chen*, and was renamed the *Dance of Seven Virtues*. The Minister of Rites, Xiao Li, thought the depiction insufficient and requested that the captures of Liu Wu Zhou, Xue Ren Gao, Dou Jian De, and Wang Shi Chong also be portrayed. The Emperor said, “They were all heroes of their time, and some of my ministers once served them as subjects. If they saw their former lords depicted thus, could they not feel sorrow?” Li apologized for his oversight.

At the time, Wei Zheng wished to promote the cessation of martial pursuits and the cultivation of civil virtue. Thus, whenever he attended a feast and saw the *Dance of Seven Virtues*, he would turn his head away; but when he saw the *Dance of Nine Merits*, he would watch intently.

The record states: Mencius said, “Is it more joyful to enjoy music alone, or to share it with others?” “It is better to share it.” “Is it more joyful to share it with few, or with many?” “It is better to share it with many.” The Emperor came close to sharing joy with both few and many. Yet Zheng did not make his intent clear, instead merely turning his head away—ah! Was this not the guidance Mencius offered to the King of Qi?

In the twelfth year, the Emperor returned to the palace and feasted officials of the fifth rank and above in the Eastern Palace. The Emperor said, “Before the *Zhenguan* era, those who joined me in securing the realm—Li Shimin’s merit is foremost. Since the *Zhenguan* era, those who corrected my errors and rectified my faults—Wei Zheng’s merit is foremost.” He bestowed upon them both jeweled swords. Then he asked, “How does my governance compare to past years?” Zheng replied, “In the past, you worried that the realm was not well-governed, so your virtue and righteousness were ever-renewed. Now, you are complacent in its stability, so you fall short. At the beginning of *Zhenguan*, fearing that none would admonish me, you often encouraged them to speak, and gladly heeded their words. Now, though you reluctantly heed them, you still show displeasure—this is the difference.” The Emperor said, “May I hear more?” Zheng said, “Once, you wished to execute the monk Yuan Lushi. Sun Fu Ga thought the law did not warrant death, and you rewarded him with the garden of Princess Lanling. Some said the reward was too generous. You replied, ‘Since my ascension, no one has admonished me, so I reward him.’ This was your way of encouraging speech. When the registrar Liu Xiong made a false accusation, you wished to execute him, but accepted Dai Zhou’s remonstrance and desisted—this was your glad acceptance. Recently, Huangfu De Ling admonished you against rebuilding the Luoyang Palace. You were angered, but reluctantly heeded my words and halted the project—this was your reluctant compliance.” The Emperor said, “None but you could point this out. People suffer from not knowing themselves.”

The record states: Observing the waxing and waning of fortune in the *Book of Changes*, one can understand the gains and losses in the progress of remonstrance. When Han Gaozu humbled his strategists, he governed them with magnanimity. Those he employed for Han were the very ones he had discarded from Chu. As the *Book of Changes* says, “Slaughtering an ox in the eastern neighbor’s sacrifice is not as good as offering a simple libation in the western neighbor’s—yet it is they who truly receive the blessing.” Does this not describe Han Gaozu? When Tang corrected the chaos of Sui, Taizong drew forth loyalty with generous rewards. Those who devoted themselves to Tang were the very ones who had flattered Sui. As the *Book of Changes* says, “Not meeting one’s father, but meeting one’s mother; not serving one’s lord as a father, but serving him as a minister.” Does this not describe Taizong?

Yet the practice of lavish rewards cannot be sustained indefinitely. Only by handling matters with utmost impartiality and ruling without self-interest can one hope to avoid the pitfall of initial diligence giving way to later indolence.

Moreover, in the era of Taizong, when sovereign and ministers gathered in feasts, they did not indulge in extravagant revelry or grow complacent in ease, but instead spurred one another to refine culture and strengthen governance—truly a case of knowing how to strengthen oneself. This is why the governance of the Zhenguan era shone so brilliantly.

Recorded:

In the eighth month of the seventeenth year of Kaiyuan, on the day *guihai*, the emperor celebrated his birthday by feasting the hundred officials beneath the Hua’e Tower. The Left Chancellor Yuan Qianyao and Right Chancellor Zhang Yue led the officials in presenting a memorial, requesting that the fifth day of the eighth month each year be established as the Mid-Autumn Festival, to be observed throughout the realm with feasting and merriment.

Recorded:

To accompany and encourage one’s lord on his birthday is the natural affection of a filial child; to offer praise and felicitations on that day is the loyal devotion of a minister. This ritual of the Tang was not an excessive measure. Yet Zhang Yue and Yuan Qianyao did not act from sincere conviction, but merely seized upon the emperor’s feast and gifts to curry favor—far from the earnest reverence shown in the Tianbao era’s celebrations of the sovereign.

The following year, in the second month, the emperor again ordered the officials to select scenic spots for pleasure outings, verging on dissipation and neglect of duty. In our present dynasty, ritual arises from principle, and the emperor’s birthday is honored as the *Wanshou Shengjie* ("August Longevity Festival"), yet the practice of selecting scenic spots for revelry has been abolished—striking the proper balance.

When Suzong ascended the throne at Lingwu, the civil and military officials numbered fewer than thirty. They cleared the wilderness to establish a court, its institutions hastily improvised. The military men grew arrogant and unruly. The great general Guan Chongsi sat in the court with his back to the throne, speaking and laughing as he pleased. The supervising censor Li Mian impeached him, and the case was referred to the authorities. The emperor, intending to pardon him, sighed and said, “With Li Mian, the court begins to command respect.”

Recorded:

After the loss of the golden *yi*-weight, the ancestral temples and altars of the Tang were cast into turmoil. Li Mian, upholding the sagely refinement of culture and embodying a majestic bearing, stood apart from others. His defense of the court’s dignity was but a fleeting moment in time, lacking the enduring framework to sustain it. Yet the emperor, recognizing that the mandate could not be taken lightly and that the slightest misstep could not be ignored, entrusted Li Mian with great responsibilities. At opportune moments, he impeached and admonished, displaying resolute judgment to curb the arrogance of martial officers and fierce generals, preventing petty officers from overawing their commanders and ensuring that the rise and fall of *jiedu* governors did not rest with the soldiers. Had this course been followed, the later calamities of the *fanzhen* would never have arisen. To indulge in leniency as a form of kindness, unaware that gradual encroachment must not be tolerated—what could one Li Mian have done for the Tang house? Thus, observing the emperor’s special pardon, one can see why the Tang never recovered. How lamentable!

From the *Old History of the Tang*:

Dezong honored Guo Ziyi as *bushi* ("Teacher of the Realm") and styled him *Shangfu* ("Exalted Father"). The imperial edict read:

Heaven and Earth bring forth the myriad things through the four seasons; the sovereign relies on his ministers as limbs to assist him. The task of marshaling troops and stabilizing the realm has been passed down through generations. Above, he harmonizes the Three Luminaries; below, he shields the Five Peaks. He rightly oversees the myriad concerns, pacifies the four barbarians, embodies the qi of primal harmony, and roots himself in the virtue of steadfast unity. His achievements are vast yet he does not boast; his position is lofty yet he remains composed. As *Shangfu*, his name is likened to Lü Wang; as *bushi*, his rank surpasses that of the Duke of Zhou. The Prince of Fenyang, a hero sent down by Heaven, was born with the wisdom to aid a king. He trained his troops as a father, divined the enemy’s moves like a spirit. He supported Suzong and restored the realm, quelling crises for the state and driving out invaders from the frontiers. In securing the altars of the soil and grain, what did he have to envy in the Marquis of Jiang? In pacifying the Qiang and Rong, he was no less than Zhao Chongguo. At Jiangtai, he soothed the scattered multitudes; at Jingyang, he received the surrender of a hundred thousand foes. His merit towers over past and present; his fame resounds among the barbarians. His loyalty and integrity hang like the sun and moon; his favor and esteem surpass all ministers. Honoring this elder statesman, we bestow upon him this exalted title.

It is recorded: Only with the virtue of humility and radiance does one attain the most exalted title. The honorific "Grand Tutor" was how the Zhou venerated the Grand Duke. From the Han through the Tang, none but Guo Ziyi bore it without shame. As for Wang Xingyu and Liu Shouguang—those ringleaders of treason—along with Qian Liu, whose clanging cymbals marked his rebellion, though they rendered service in defending Wu and Yue, such merit suffices for one region but not for the realm entire.

*The Comprehensive Mirror* states: In the autumn of the seventh month of the first year of Baoying under Suzong, Guo Ziyi entered court, but due to Cheng Yuanzhen’s envy, he was detained in the capital. In the second year of Dali under Daizong, in the second month, Guo Ziyi entered court and imprisoned his son Guo Ai to await punishment. In the twelfth month, Guo Ziyi entered court, for Yu Chao’en had long despised him and desecrated his father’s tomb, yet he made no dispute. In the spring of the fourth year, in the first month, Guo Ziyi entered court, as Yuan Zai warned of Yu Chao’en’s plotting, but he neither acted against him nor heeded the warning. In the ninth year, in the second month, Guo Ziyi entered court, and the troops of Shuofang were increased. In the tenth year, Guo Ziyi entered court and memorialized to remove one prefectural or county official, but received no reply. In the winter of the thirteenth year, in the twelfth month, Guo Ziyi entered court. Altogether, he entered court seven times, and the historiographical principle states: This is why Guo Ziyi was a paragon of loyalty—Li Guangbi paled in comparison.

It is recorded: In the 242 years of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Confucius noted twice when dukes came to the royal court and once when they entered the capital. Yet in the twenty-odd years of Suzong and Daizong’s reigns, Zhu Xi recorded Guo Ziyi’s seven entries into court, and the records never ceased, nor did the praise. Was this not the beauty of yielding virtue and the truth of self-reflection? Thus his merit overshadowed the realm, yet the sovereign never doubted him; his rank reached the pinnacle of ministers, yet none envied him.

The *Book of Changes* says: "The laboring and modest nobleman will have a good end." Confucius appended: "To toil without boasting, to achieve without claiming merit—this is the utmost in magnanimity." This speaks of one who humbles himself despite his accomplishments. Virtue is called abundance; ritual is called reverence. Humility is the means to cultivate reverence and preserve one’s position. This describes the Duke’s conduct.

*Hongdao Record*, Volume 30: *Rites*

**Rites of Ruler and Minister**

From the *Annals of Song*: Emperor Taizu of the Great Song often studied the *Two Classics* and sighed, saying: "In the time of Yao and Shun, the punishment for the Four Felons was merely exile. Why then are the legal nets of recent ages so tightly woven?" Thereupon, he established laws: flogging and cudgeling were forbidden within the palace halls, and insults were not to reach the ranks of high ministers. Thus, from the Kaibao era onward, those guilty of capital offenses—unless their crimes were deeply harmful to law and reason—were often spared death. Only corrupt officials were executed in the marketplace, never granted clemency.

*Record* states: This household law of the Song surpassed those of Han and Tang; few later dynasties could match it. For rites and righteousness, integrity and shame are what the ruler uses to inspire and uphold. That which lifts a decadent age to the flourishing of the Three Dynasties is what distinguishes the gentry from common folk, humanity from beasts, and the noble from the base. The stakes are no small matter. As for corrupt officials, their crimes are especially grave; once convicted, they are almost never pardoned. Throughout the Song dynasty, though ministers might commit offenses, unless they were guilty of corruption, the law prescribed exile. Even then, the sovereign would personally request a favorable place of banishment. Never did one hear of a minister beaten to death or executed by executioner’s blade. Was this not the depth of the ancestral founders’ intent and the excellence of their descendants’ adherence to the law?

Emperor Taizong once summoned the Hanlin Academician Dou Yi to draft an edict. As Yi arrived at the palace gate, he saw the emperor sitting with his robes disheveled and feet bare. Yi halted and refused to advance. The emperor hastily donned his crown and robes before summoning him in. Yi then said: "Your Majesty has founded a dynasty and established a legacy. You should exemplify ritual for all under heaven, lest the heroic and talented lose heart upon hearing of this." The emperor composed his expression and thanked him. Thereafter, he never appeared before his close ministers without proper attire.

*Record* states: The emperor’s restraint of desire was not like that of the ancients, who were often indulgent. His disheveled state and bare feet were but a momentary lapse. His hasty donning of robes and composed demeanor arose from his true nature, not from pretense or affectation. Yi was esteemed for his gravity and integrity; how could he have wished to entrap his ruler in impropriety? His refusal to advance was nearly an act of self-respect. Alas! In this exchange between ruler and minister, both achieved their proper measure.

In the eighth year of the Taiping Xingguo era of Emperor Taizong, he personally examined the tribute scholars of the Ministry of Rites at the Hall of Martial Instruction. For the first time, the candidates were divided into three ranks, and a banquet was bestowed upon them at the Qionglin Park, where they were honored with poems. This became an established institution.

*Record* states: The *Deer Cry Banquet* is a grand ceremony for welcoming guests and promoting scholars. The Qionglin Banquet is an exceptional grace bestowed by the sovereign. Our dynasty’s renowned banquet of honor and favor surpasses these precedents. Moreover, when the court established the ceremonial robes for all officials, they offered congratulatory words, saying: *"Heaven unfolds the literary fortune, and the worthy and talented ascend to office—this is a fitting occasion for celebration,"* which cannot be compared to ordinary rites.

From the *Record of Words and Deeds*: In the fourth year of the Tiansheng era of Emperor Renzong, when the lecturer Hu Yuan was summoned, he was required by custom to first practice court etiquette at the Gate Chamber. Yuan said: *"All the books I have read in my life are the rites for serving the ruler. Why should I practice further?"* The Gate Chamber reported this, and the emperor permitted him to practice on his boat en route. The emperor did not press him. People assumed that this rustic scholar would surely breach protocol, but when he entered for his audience, his performance greatly pleased the emperor. The emperor remarked to his attendants: *"Hu Yuan’s advancement, retreat, and every movement accord with ancient ritual."*

*Record* states: Today’s court audience rites require all to practice etiquette at the Court of State Ceremonial, precisely to prevent those from humble backgrounds from being unaware. This is a fixed rule, recorded in the statutes. Yet Yuan’s exemption from this precedent also reveals the sagely virtue of the sovereign, whose magnanimity extends to all things. The flourishing atmosphere of the era may thus be glimpsed. Let this be recorded.

From the *Biographies*: In the first year of the Xining era of Emperor Shenzong, when Fu Bi came to court, he was permitted to ride in a palanquin to the palace gate. The emperor received him at the small hall of the Inner East Gate, ordering his sons to support him as he entered. He further instructed him not to bow and conversed with him at ease, inquiring about governance. Bi, perceiving the emperor’s determination to act, replied: *"The ruler’s likes and dislikes must not be discernible to others. If they can be fathomed, then the treacherous may exploit them. The ruler should observe the people as Heaven does—good and evil are self-chosen, and fortune or misfortune follows accordingly. Thus, merit and fault will invariably be justly assessed."* When asked about border affairs, he replied: *"Your Majesty has reigned but briefly; you should first spread virtue and bestow kindness. I hope that for twenty years, you will not speak of war."* The emperor fell silent, and only at dusk did Bi withdraw.

*Record* states: When Bi served as chief minister under Emperor Renzong, he once said: *"Exalting with empty ritual is not as good as advancing with utmost sincerity."* Now, observe how he was carried to the hall in a palanquin, seated without bowing, and engaged in unconstrained conversation—this was ritual. When he remonstrated, the emperor heeded him; when he spoke, the emperor listened—this was sincerity. At the beginning of the emperor’s reign, governance was like the sun at dawn, while Bi’s counsel was like a square piece fitting into its proper place. Truly, his words were medicine for the malady and an acupuncture needle for immediate effect. Yet why was it not so? The once-vigorous momentum turned into a silent response. Though empty ritual was exalted, sincerity was not fully extended. Observing the exchanges between these two emperors, the difference in their success and failure is as vast as heaven and earth.

In the first year of Yuanyou during Emperor Zhezong’s reign, an edict was issued appointing Grand Preceptor Wen Yanbo as Participant in the Deliberation of Military and State Affairs. At the time, he was eighty-one years old. Yanbo had served four successive reigns and held the posts of general and chief minister for fifty years, his name renowned among the Four Barbarians. When the Khitan envoy Yelü Yongchang came on a diplomatic mission, upon seeing him outside the palace gate, he stepped back, adjusted his expression, and said, “This is the *Er Teng* Duke!” He then asked his age, remarking, “How robust he is!” Su Shi commented, “The envoy has seen his bearing but has yet to hear his words.” In managing the myriad affairs of state, even the most astute and experienced youths could not match him; in his mastery of history from antiquity to the present, even specialists in their fields fell short. The envoy clasped his hands and said, “He is a man of extraordinary talent in the world.”

The Khitan’s elder brother possessed a famous horse and requested permission from the border officials to present it as a gift, which the imperial court granted. Such was the respect he commanded among foreign nations. By this time, Sima Guang remarked, “He is a venerable elder of long-standing virtue; it is fitting to recall him to assist in governance.” Empress Dowager Xuanren thus issued the decree, elevating his status with exceptional ceremony and ranking him above the chief ministers. The emperor held court with him once every six days, and he attended the imperial lecture hall once every two months—a rarity in ancient and modern times.

At the time, when the emperor received him, he showed utmost reverence. During the announcement of successful candidates in the imperial examination, Yanbo stood in attendance the entire day. The emperor repeatedly urged him, “Grand Preceptor, please rest.” Yanbo kowtowed in gratitude but remained standing until the proceedings concluded. When Cheng Yi served as imperial lecturer, he conducted himself with the dignity of a teacher, and his admonitions were always couched in subtle reproof, so that the emperor held him in awe. Someone once asked Cheng Yi, “How do you compare yourself to Duke Di?” Cheng Yi replied, “Duke Teng served as a great minister through three reigns; in attending a young sovereign, he could not but show deference. I, however, am a commoner serving as the emperor’s tutor—how dare I not hold myself in proper regard? This is why we differ.”

*Recorded:* Mencius said, “Zengzi was a teacher and an elder; Zisi was a minister and a subordinate. Had Zengzi and Zisi exchanged places, each would have acted accordingly.” Thus, had Yougong [Wen Yanbo] been in Cheng Yi’s position, he would not have abandoned the ritual of sitting while lecturing; and had Cheng Yi occupied Yougong’s rank, how could he have altered his customary reverence and prudence?

When Su Shi served as Hanlin Academician, whenever he read aloud at the imperial lecture hall—whether on matters of governance, rise and fall, right and wrong, or success and failure—he never failed to expound at length, hoping to enlighten the emperor. Once, he was summoned to stay overnight in the palace and was received in the side hall. The Grand Empress Dowager asked, “What position do you hold now?” He replied, “I am a guilty official in the Hanlin Academy.” She asked, “How did you attain this?” He answered, “Through the grace of the Grand Empress Dowager and Your Imperial Majesty.” She said, “That is not so. Was it not due to the recommendation of high ministers?” He replied, “Not that either.” Startled, Su Shi said, “Though I am unworthy, I would not dare advance through any other means.” She said, “This was the intention of the late emperor. He often recited your writings and would invariably sigh, ‘What extraordinary talent!’ Extraordinary indeed—he simply did not live to employ you.” Upon hearing this, Su Shi could not help but weep aloud, and the Grand Empress Dowager and the emperor also shed tears, while all those present were moved to tears.

Afterward, she ordered him to be seated and served tea, then had the golden lotus lanterns from the imperial presence carried to escort him back to his quarters. Cheng Yi later requested to conduct lectures in the Chongzheng and Yanhe Halls, submitting a memorial that read: “Recently, the *Jiying* Hall has grown warm, so I humbly request to move the lectures to the Chongzheng and Yanhe Halls, with the participation of the Palace Attendant.” Gu Lin, however, opposed holding lectures in the Yanhe Hall, arguing that lecturers should not be allowed in the main hall, citing the need to uphold the emperor’s dignity. Cheng Yi replied, “I need not cite distant precedents; I shall speak only of our dynasty’s own history. Emperor Taizu summoned Wang Zhaosu to lecture on the *Book of Changes*; Emperor Zhenzong had Cui Yizheng lecture on the *Book of Documents* and Xing Yu on the *Spring and Autumn Annals*—all within the main hall. At that time, the lecturers still sat; the custom of standing while lecturing was first introduced at the behest of Empress Dowager Mingsu. This was yet another manifestation of our ancestors’ reverence for scholars and the Dao—a model not only for their descendants but for emperors of all ages.

In the present age, vulgar men may speak of ‘honoring the ruler,’ but they do not understand the true way to do so. A ruler’s dignity increases only with the elevation of his virtue; in terms of power and position, he is already at the utmost height. His majesty is already supreme—how could it be further augmented?”

*Recorded:* Cheng Yi’s argument for sitting while lecturing was stern and upright; Su Shi’s audience in the side hall was a moment of profound favor. The former exemplified the house traditions of the Song, far surpassing those of the Han and Tang; the latter reflected the benevolence of the empress dowager, akin to that of Yao and Shun. Even a hundred generations hence, these events inspire unceasing reverence and admiration—how splendid they are!

According to the *Treatise on Rites*: In the second year of his reign, Emperor Taizu had the Grand Master of Ceremonies, Nie Congyi, present the *Illustrations of the Three Ritual Classics*, and he ordered scholars to deliberate and finalize them. During the Kaibao era, he commanded the Censor-in-Chief Liu Wensou, Academician Li Fang, Drafter of Imperial Edicts Lu Duoxun, Reminder Jia Huangzhong, and Gentleman for Court Audience He Xian to compile the *Comprehensive Rites of the Kaibao Era* in two hundred volumes, based on the *Rites of the Kaiyuan Era* with additions and omissions. Later, they also established the *Exegesis of the Comprehensive Rites*, compiling one hundred volumes. Emperor Taizong esteemed refined learning and restored proper institutions, largely reviving what had been neglected.

Emperor Zhenzong, succeeding a period of great prosperity, maintained peaceful relations with the Khitan, and with the realm at peace, he performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices and worshipped at the Fen River—these were all elaborate rituals of the time. Earlier, during the Tianxi era, Chen Kuan had organized the records of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, but the constant issuance of new and old edicts had left the work unfinished. At the beginning of the Tiansheng era under Emperor Renzong, the Grand Master of Ceremonies Wang Hao began compiling edicts from the founding of the dynasty to the Qianxing era, removing redundancies and categorizing them under the five rites, resulting in a new compilation of sixty volumes. In the fourth year of Jingyou, Jia Changchao compiled the *New Rites of the Grand Master of Ceremonies* and the *Sacrificial Ceremonies*. At the beginning of the Huangyou era, Wen Yanbo compiled the *Records of the Grand Sacrifice at the Bright Hall* in twenty volumes. By the Jiayou era, as the rites had fallen into disuse, Ouyang Xiu was ordered to oversee a bureau to revise the *Comprehensive Rites*, record their changes, and organize the *New Rites* by category into one hundred volumes. This work was named the *Adapted and Innovated Rites of the Grand Master of Ceremonies*, with roughly thirteen or fourteen parts differing from the old versions.

The record states: In my humble observation, though the subtle intent of history remains unmanifest, does it not already express excessive regret for Emperor Renzong? Why is this so? Taizu inherited the chaos of the Five Dynasties; though he ascended the throne through abdication, he could not personally undertake the task of institutional creation. Taizong, amid the fortunes of a rising state, faced frequent obstructions among his kin—how could he have devised a plan of perfect goodness and beauty? The institutions of Zhenzong, replete with literary embellishments, left much to be desired. By the time of Renzong, a century of accumulated virtue had passed, and the moment had come to properly establish rites and compose music.

Moreover, the emperor’s endowment was such that he preserved benevolence in his heart and maintained ritual in his heart. What he enacted was universal love and universal reverence, so that all within the four seas were pervaded by constant respect and constant affection. No other sovereign could even faintly approximate this in the slightest. Had there been a figure like the Duke of Zhou to assist and counsel him, establishing the ultimate mean of central harmony, unifying and synthesizing all principles—like the resonance of metal and the vibration of jade—how could he have merely followed the old bureaucratic documents, lacking any substantive foundation, as history laments?

Furthermore, Renzong was deeply devoted to learning. Once, when Wang Mei lectured on the *Rites of Zhou*, the emperor ordered illustrations of carriages, robes, crowns, sacrificial vessels, and ceremonial utensils to be drawn. Yet he could not fully grasp the fundamental principles of their construction, nor could he aspire to the prosperity of the Three Dynasties—how much less could he achieve anything beyond this?

Some ask: Had the two scholars of Lu lived in his time, could they have created such institutions? The answer is: They could not. For the ultimate rites align with the order of heaven and earth, and the ultimate music harmonizes with the harmony of heaven and earth. Without the utmost sincerity of the world, exhausting one’s nature to fulfill the natures of others and all things, and assisting in the transformation and nourishment of heaven and earth, such attainment is impossible. Though the two scholars could uphold the rites and righteousness of Lu, how could they achieve central harmony as described by Zisi? Moreover, the learning of Song emperors merely pursued broad reading—how could works like the *Taiping Guangji* or *Cefu Yuangui* be mentioned in the same breath?

Thus, what Renzong cherished was nothing more than the superficial details of ritual implements. No wonder he could not meet expectations. Zhu Xi, in his petition to revise the Three Rites, stated: "I have heard that the Way of the Six Classics converges in unity, yet the application of rites and music is most urgent. After the Qin destroyed learning, rites and music were the first to decay. From the Han and Jin onward, various scholars patched and repaired them, but no complete work remained—only the Three Rites survived in part. The *Rites of Zhou* serves as the guiding principle of ritual, while its ceremonial methods and measurements are found in the *Etiquette and Rites*, which is the root text. The *Book of Rites*, including chapters such as *Jiao Te Sheng* and *Guan Yi*, serves as its exegetical commentary.

Previously, there were still examinations on the Three Rites, *Comprehensive Rites*, and other classical studies. Though the rites were not practiced, scholars could still recite and understand their doctrines. Since the Xining era, Wang Anshi disrupted the old system, abolishing the *Etiquette and Rites* and retaining only the *Book of Rites* as a subject. By abandoning the classic in favor of its commentary and neglecting the root to pursue the branches, the error was grave. Yet the erudites and students merely recited its empty text to prepare for examinations. Even when questions were based on actual ceremonial methods and measurements, all were lost in obscurity, ignorant of their origins. In any major deliberation, they relied solely on hearsay and conjecture.

When I was in seclusion, I once discussed these matters with a few scholars, intending to take the *Etiquette and Rites* as the root text and append to it relevant passages from the *Book of Rites* and other classics, histories, and miscellaneous works. We would compile annotations and the commentaries of various scholars to establish a coherent system. However, as a private individual, I lacked access to books for reference and copyists, so the work remained unfinished. Later, upon receiving an official appointment, my students dispersed, and the project could not be completed.

I humbly beseech Your Sagely Majesty to issue a special decree to the relevant authorities, permitting me to borrow books on rites and music from the Imperial Library. I would then recruit over ten former students, secure several vacant official residences for their lodging, and have them compile and categorize the materials. Though they would hold official positions, they would not receive official salaries—only a monthly stipend for food, paper, brushes, ink, oil, and candles. The copyists, over twenty in number, would be assigned by the Lin’an Prefecture, with their expenses covered by the bureau’s budget, without additional rewards. This would incur no great cost to the state yet could revive what has been lost, leaving a lasting legacy and guiding scholars toward substantive learning. In time, this could aid the sagely court in institutional creation—a great fortune for our culture."

The record concludes: The memorial of Master Song ends here. Since the mid-Song, masters from the Luo, Guan, and Min schools emerged in succession. Master Zhou said: "Only after regulating yin and yang can harmony be achieved; thus, rites come before music." He also said: "Gentle, yielding, central, and balanced—this is the flourishing of virtue. When the world is transformed by the mean, governance reaches its perfection. This is called the Way matching heaven and earth, the ultimate of antiquity." Master Cheng said: "Rites are the means by which one establishes oneself. To be at ease with rites and harmonize with music is the height of virtue." He also said: "What rites revere is their underlying principle. To lose the principle while preserving the details is the work of mere ritualists." Master Zhang said: "Rites are the means by which one sustains one’s nature. Rites originally arise from nature; sustaining one’s nature is returning to the root." He also said: "Rites are not merely visible in external forms; there are also formless rites. Without rites, there is no Way in the world." Master Zhu said: "Rites are the natural principles of heaven and earth; one cannot lack even a fraction, nor can one add even a fraction. Only the heart of the sage unites with heaven, so that every action in accordance with rites aligns perfectly with heaven."

Alas! Are not these words the very foundation of institutional creation?

Should the many sages of the Song have attained their rightful positions and practiced the Dao, then the rites and music of that dynasty might have rivaled those of earlier ages. Yet why were they confined to self-cultivation in obscurity, never finding recognition at the highest levels? Instead, men like Wang, Lü, Zhang, Cai, Qin, Han, Jia, and Shi successively occupied the positions of imperial tutors and chief ministers, monopolizing the power to create institutions. They ensured that scholar-officials and great Confucians suffered the hardships of having no books to consult and no scribes to copy texts.

Nevertheless, there remained disciples to gather and followers to entrust. Compared to the present, where profit and power dominate all, where no disciples or followers are to be found—where men willingly content themselves with brushes and inkstones, facing each other in isolation—the desolation of that era pales in comparison.

In the *Imperial Decrees of the August Ming*, the edict of the fifth year of Hongwu states: "I have heard that the Three Sovereigns established the ultimate norm, and the Five Emperors followed their teachings. In times when institutions were not yet complete, it was fitting for rulers to instruct the people. The Three Dynasties adhered to this, and the people lived in harmony. From the Zhou to the Han, Tang, and Song, each dynasty expanded and refined these institutions, and thus the state prospered, the people thrived in their time, and families enjoyed lasting peace.

By the grace of the August Heaven and Earth, the mandate of my ancestors, and the protection of the myriad spirits, I have rightfully ascended the imperial throne. Though I am but a humble man of the fields, untrained in the sacred classics, I have spent over twenty years pacifying and governing, never resting in peace, my meals coarse and simple. Thus, the Dao has not yet been fully realized, and the people remain untransformed. In villages, markets, and neighborhoods, the customs of the Yuan still linger. Now that the realm is at peace, how can rites, propriety, and social mores not be rectified?

Herein I issue this decree to all my officials and people: once this edict arrives, those who dare disobey shall be punished according to the law."

The record states: Was not this edict of the sagely ancestor far superior to the ways of those who rule by force? Shang Yang discarded rites and righteousness, cast aside honor and shame, and left a legacy of filth for a thousand generations. The Han, beginning with their three-chapter covenant, never once mentioned these principles. When Lu Jia frequently spoke of them, he was dismissed with, 'What use is that?' When Jia Yi wept bitter tears, he was met with, 'There is no time for such things.' Never was a single word or decree issued to promote rites, righteousness, or social mores. This is why, throughout the Han dynasty, they followed the Qin’s mixed legacy of hegemony, with no means of transformation. How different from the Great Ming, which, though customs had collapsed and morality had sunk into the earth, transformed the people entirely, bringing great unity to the realm! I am fortunate to have witnessed this flourishing age. Thus, I record it here.

**The Record of Sagely Governance**:
At the founding of the dynasty, the emperor governed his ministers with ritual propriety, often bestowing gifts upon his counselors. To Minister Tao An, he affixed a plaque at his gate, inscribed: *"A strategist unmatched in the imperial court, a literary master second to none in the Hanlin Academy."* He summoned the foremost scholars of Jiangnan to deliberate on rites and appointed Tao as chief compiler.

He also granted Academician Song Lian the honor of composing a poem while drinking in the emperor’s presence, declaring: *"Let future generations know that We and Our ministers shared such joy together."*

When Song Lian retired, the emperor presented him with three sets of robes and inquired: *"How old are you now?"*
*"Sixty-eight,"* Song replied.
The emperor said: *"Keep these fine silks, and in thirty-two years, they shall serve as your centennial garments."*

Initially, Song had requested to pay court once a year. In the ninth month of that year, he arrived for an audience. The emperor had long awaited him, and upon his arrival, rejoiced greatly. He dispatched the Ministry of Rites to deliver delicacies and various goods to Song’s lodgings as gifts. Thereafter, Song accompanied the emperor, touring palaces and inspecting the imperial precincts. The emperor questioned him thoroughly, and when they dined together in the side hall, Song did not retire until the feast concluded. The emperor sighed and said: *"A minister of perfect loyalty!"*

When sweet dew descended, the emperor summoned Song, seated him, and personally took up a golden ladle. Refining the broth in a tripod, he scooped the sweet dew with his own hands, pouring it into a goblet, and said: *"This is the essence of harmonious qi, capable of curing illness and prolonging life. Thus do We share it with you."*

**Recorded Note**:
This conduct was yet more virtuous than that of those who indulge in drunken revelry or treat scholars with contempt. For even the Han could not summon the likes of the Four Hoary Ones of Mount Shang...

While the Four Scholars of Zhe, the Ming Ancestor first summoned and employed. As for Tao of Dangtu, his mastery of the Learning of the Lian, Luo, Guan, and Min schools was likewise no different from that of the Four Masters. This is why his radiance illumined the Four Seas, leaving no trace of the foul, usurping, and defiling airs—precisely because he revered and honored eminent scholars, far emulating the legacy of sage emperors and august sovereigns of old. Ah, how magnificent!

During the Yongle reign, the Minister of Personnel, Sai Yi, served as Junior Preceptor for nine years, while the Minister of Revenue, Xia Yuanji, held the post of Junior Guardian for three terms. Both were granted imperial commendations and rewards, with the emperor praising them as *"pure, good, sincere, and steadfast, like the famed ministers of antiquity."* After a banquet was bestowed upon them at the Ministry of Rites, the emperor personally feasted them in a separate hall, presenting each with a silver seal inscribed: *"Rectify Errors and Correct Faults."* He further instructed them: *"Should We commit any misstep, you need only memorialize it to Us."* By this, he made known: *"We shall not hesitate to follow good counsel."*

The following year, they accompanied the emperor on his northern frontier inspection. Upon their return, the emperor, mindful of their advanced age, wished to grant them ease and comfort. He bestowed further commendations and rewards, relieving them of their duties while preserving their emoluments, so they might attend court morning and evening, ever ready to offer counsel and deliberation. Thus, the grace and favor accorded them grew even deeper.

**Recorded Note:**
Since the time when Heaven showed Us the proper path, who has not regarded private banquets as intimacy, reverence as special favor, or exceptional grace as singular kindness? Yet who has ever been charged with *"rectifying errors and correcting faults"*? Even the Crimson Sky Hall and Black Tortoise Gate of Tang Taizong cannot compare. For these two ministers, bound in trust to the sagely emperor, were as close as his own heart and spine—steadfast as divination by turtle shell or milfoil, unshaken by power or profit, untouched by slander or defamation. Such are the *"good and noble gentlemen whose hearts are knit fast."* Observing how they did not claim virtue for private favors but instead strove to guide and support one another, ever earnest in following the good, one may see the age when *"superior and inferior harmonize, and all is at peace."* Let this be recorded.

**The Record of Illustrious Ministers** states: Minister of Personnel in Nanjing, Wei Ji, lived to ninety-eight. Having already been elevated to the rank of Grand Master for Glorious Happiness, upon the petition of Censor Liang Fang, Emperor Xianzong personally instructed the Ministry of Rites: "Minister Wei Ji has reached a venerable age and possesses both virtue and prestige; We deeply admire and rejoice in this. Dispatch envoys to convey Our regards, bestow upon him mutton and wine, and have the authorities provide him monthly with three *shi* of rice for his sustenance."

Earlier, the gentleman had served as Instructor of Songjiang, conducting himself with propriety. He was recommended to the post of Erudite of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices. During the Xuande reign, he was promoted to Vice Director of the Bureau of Evaluations, then transferred to Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices. In the third year of the Zhengtong era, he was appointed Vice Minister of Personnel, later rising to the full ministerial rank. Throughout his tenure, he earned a sterling reputation. Even the powerful eunuch Wang Zhen treated him with deference, addressing him as "Master" and consulting him on ritual matters. Though Wang once offered him a mere square of silk, Wei did not quibble.

When the Jingtai era began, Wei arrived in the capital. At the time, Grand Secretary Chen Xu presided over the imperial examinations, and the scholars he selected were Wei’s former students. Chen entreated him: "Though you hold the highest office, you have never stood in court. I hope you will remain a while longer—such matters rest with us." Wei refused, later remarking to others: "He treats the affairs of the court as his own. How can such a man come to a good end?"

**Recorded Remarks:** Observing Wenjing’s rise from a minor educational post to the highest offices, one notes that in his early years, he devoted himself to nurturing talent, yet showed no extraordinary brilliance akin to *"mending the heavens or bathing in the sun."* In his later years, he was known for his integrity, prudence, solemnity, and reticence—yet he performed no earth-shaking deeds. This was due to the successive sagely emperors of the ancestral dynasty, who cherished talent and allowed him to serve long and effectively. Though he lacked resounding fame, his enduring influence left an indelible impression, commanding respect from high officials and earnest pleas from the Grand Secretariat to remain. Could such a man have achieved this in a single day? In the end, he attained the rare longevity of a centenarian and the lofty rank of Grand Preceptor.

Mencius said: *"In the court, nothing is as esteemed as rank; in the village, nothing as esteemed as age; for assisting the world and guiding the people, nothing surpasses virtue."* This surely describes Minister Wenjing.

In the *yichou* year of the Hongzhi era, as Emperor Wuzong ascended the throne and respectfully bestowed honorific titles upon the two palaces, he issued an edict granting favors to the elderly, extending grace throughout the realm. At the time, Grand Guardian and Minister of Personnel Wang Shu had retired to his home at the age of ninety. The emperor specially conferred upon him an imperial rescript, dispatching envoys with silk, wine, and other gifts to convey his solicitude. The ceremonial grandeur and radiant honor were extraordinary.

Wei lived during the flourishing Yongle era and witnessed the lingering legacy of the ancestral emperors. Through the Xuande and Zhengtong reigns, he basked in the abundance of their teachings, serving in the inner palace, outer prefectures, and even as a regional governor. During the Tianshun era of renewed diligence and the Chenghua reign, he roused himself to rein in the powerful, impeach the corrupt, and enforce the law with impartiality. Yet when his intentions clashed with those of the emperor, he resolutely withdrew, and his reputation soared. At the beginning of the Hongzhi era, he was specially recalled to uphold the law and govern, but was again slandered by the wicked and ultimately retired without compromising his principles.

In his later years, his bearing was dignified and magnanimous. He wrote books, studied the *Book of Changes*, and explored the principles of the world without respite. His appetite and vigor remained as robust as that of a man in his fifties or sixties. Amid the passing of his contemporaries and the transformations of the state, he alone stood tall—a true elder of the realm.

**Recorded Remarks:** Of those who attained advanced age like the legendary Chuzai, San Yuan remarked: *"Only Minister Wei Wenjing and this gentleman matched each other in rank, virtue, and moral standing."* Yet when it came to achievements and eloquence, Wenjing seemed somewhat inferior. I contend that what truly matters is the elevation of one’s name and virtue. When Wei’s disciple, Grand Secretary Chen, urged him to stay, he remained steadfast and unyielding—not only resisting corruption but also foreseeing events with unerring accuracy. In this age, could there be another like him? Thus, achievements and eloquence are but secondary considerations.

At the beginning of the Jiajing era, the emperor exhorted the retired Grand Secretary Xie Qian: *"Of ministers who serve in court, few succeed in realizing their aspirations and establishing meritorious deeds. Yet to retire to one’s hometown, enjoy longevity and health, preserve one’s reputation and integrity, and thereby sustain the hopes of the realm—this is even more difficult. You, sir, possess an upright nature and far-reaching vision. From your early years, you devoted yourself to true learning, achieving literary preeminence and rising to prominence in the Hanlin Academy, your reputation ever-growing. When Our late father, the Xiaohuang Emperor, took note of you, he promoted you from the palace to the Grand Secretariat. Day and night, you offered counsel—neither obstinate nor compliant—guarding the established norms, protecting the worthy, and advising in the imperial chambers. Your forthright and beneficial words contributed greatly to the governance of the time. The purity of the era’s administration was largely due to the efforts of you and a few other ministers. When Our father’s final instructions entrusted you with weighty responsibilities, you were deeply moved by his trust and vowed to serve with utmost sincerity. At the beginning of the Wuzong Emperor’s reign, you assisted him with unwavering resolve, yet your unyielding integrity often showed in your words and demeanor. The path of uprightness found no place, and you retired, your noble character resounding throughout the land. Later, you suffered the slander of powerful villains, but your reputation was soon vindicated, and the people’s admiration for you remained undiminished."*

This year, as you reach seventy years of age, your body remains in peace and health, your descendants flourish, and your perfect virtue and illustrious reputation are rarely matched in previous eras. We have succeeded to the celestial mandate and seek to renew governance. You, as a venerable elder of successive courts, have profoundly influenced Our aspirations. Indeed, public opinion has long extolled your excellence, which surpasses that of others by far.

We specially dispatch an emissary to convey Our esteemed regards, bestowing this exceptional honor. May you embrace Our deepest intentions, cultivate harmony with heaven, and abundantly receive longevity and blessings, thereby serving as a model for the realm. This is not merely the glory of one individual or one locality.

Recorded: At the beginning of Our reign, with no leisure for other affairs, We first dispatched an emissary to convey Our esteemed regards to Minister Liu of Luoyang, Minister Han of Hongdong, and Minister Xie of Yuyao—three elders of the era. This record concludes with Minister Xie, for We personally received his response to the imperial edict and witnessed the grand ceremony with Our own eyes, which is not comparable to hearsay. Thus, it is fully recorded here to serve as a model of the rites between ruler and minister for all generations.

*Hongdao Record, Volume 30 concluded*
*Hongdao Record, Volume 31*

The Rites of Father and Son

*The Book of Yu* states: "Reverently he appeared before Gu Sou, trembling with awe and solemnity—truly it was thus."

Recorded: During the reign of Emperor Gao of Han, he once rewarded his household steward. When his father, the Grand Duke, was received with a grand escort, people all said: "A father cannot be treated as a son." Later, when the Emperor visited Xinfeng, and his father sat leisurely with legs spread, people all said: "A ruler cannot be treated as a minister." Yet they did not realize this was the very argument of Qian Qiumeng.

The distinction between father and son is rooted in the natural order of heaven and earth, established before heaven and earth themselves. The rites of ruler and minister arise from the bonds of lineage and sustenance, born after heaven and earth. Thus, the bond of father and son may encompass the rites of ruler and minister, but the rites of ruler and minister cannot alter the bond of father and son. Those who regard an escort as reverence—have they ever known what "reverently he appeared" truly means? Those who take sprawling posture as joy—have they ever seen what "trembling with awe and solemnity" looks like? The saying that "a father cannot be treated as a son" may seem a mere turn of phrase, but the difference is as vast as a hair’s breadth to a thousand *li*—it must be clearly distinguished.

Mencius said: "The utmost of filial piety is none greater than honoring one’s parents. The utmost of honoring one’s parents is none greater than nourishing them with all under heaven." To be the father of the Son of Heaven is the highest honor. To nourish with all under heaven is the highest nourishment.

Recorded: Mencius said: "The utmost of filial piety is none greater than honoring one’s parents." After Shun became the Son of Heaven, why did he not honor Gu Sou by making him emperor? He also said: "To be the father of the Son of Heaven is the highest honor." Though Shun did not honor Gu Sou as emperor, neither did he address Yao as his father. What is the reason for these two cases?

It is said: The rites of posthumous enfeoffment were only fully established by the Zhou. It is not fitting to take Shun as the standard. The title of "Imperial Uncle" first appeared in the Song Dynasty, and it is even less appropriate to model after the precedent of the Duke of Pu. In essence, the heavenly order and heavenly ranks cannot be altered. The succession of the lineage and inheritance of the mandate cannot be delayed. The reason it cannot be delayed is that it establishes the great foundation of all under heaven. The reason it cannot be altered is that it enacts the universal Dao of all under heaven. These two principles stand and operate together without conflict or contradiction.

If one merely emphasizes honoring parents without valuing the succession of the mandate, one fails to grasp the greatness of Shun’s succession to Yao. If one merely emphasizes the importance of the successor while stripping away the affection for one’s own parents, one fails to grasp the utmost of honoring Gu Sou. The error lies in not properly observing that when one who is a ruler speaks of the way of a father, one mistakenly takes it as truly unchangeable, not realizing it is not truly so. Likewise, when one observes that one who is adopted as a successor is called a son, one mistakenly takes it as truly unalterable, not realizing it is not truly so. Thus, both fail to comprehend the principle.

*The Doctrine of the Mean* states: "Shun was greatly filial. In virtue, he was a sage; in rank, he was the honored Son of Heaven; in wealth, he possessed all within the four seas. His ancestors offered sacrifices to him, and his descendants preserved his legacy."

Recorded: Someone asked: "Shun never honored Gu Sou, so why does it say his ancestors offered sacrifices to him? He never passed the throne to his son, so why does it say his descendants preserved his legacy?"

It is said: This reflects the heart of the great sage, which others cannot fathom. Gu Sou had no part in the imperial succession, yet if honored, how could he be properly sacrificed to? Shang Jun did not measure up to the mandate of heaven, so if the throne were passed to him, how could his legacy be preserved? Honoring Gu Sou as the father of the Son of Heaven is the utmost honor. Offering sacrifices to Gu Sou with the rites of the Son of Heaven is the utmost sacrifice. Thus, it is said: "His ancestors offered sacrifices to him." Yu was enfeoffed in Yu, and Hu Gong in Chen—these were the utmost honors for the descendants of the great sage. Thus, it is said: "His descendants preserved his legacy."

*The Laws of Sacrifice* states: "The Xia dynasty sacrificed to the Yellow Emperor and offered suburban sacrifices to Gun."

Recorded: Liu’s commentary says: "The Five Emperors governed all under heaven as officials. From Yu onward, they honored merit and venerated virtue, as explained in Zheng’s commentary. The Three Kings ruled all under heaven as a family, so Gun should have been honored as an ancestor, not offered suburban sacrifices."

It is said: This is what I mean by standing and operating together without conflict or contradiction. The Yu clan sacrificed to the Yellow Emperor and offered suburban sacrifices to Yao, honoring Zhuanxu as an ancestor—this purely reflects the principle of succession, for they governed all under heaven as officials. Yet as the father of the Son of Heaven, Gu Sou’s honor remained unchanged, and his personal kinship was never abolished. As for the Xia’s suburban sacrifice to Gun, Yu’s achievements were rooted in filial piety, and with the earth pacified and heaven’s work completed, all generations relied on his offerings to the Supreme Emperor. Thus, Gun had to be paired in sacrifice, for they governed all under heaven as a family. Though Gun’s flood control efforts spanned many years, it was only after Gun that Yu arose. How could the benefits extending from east to west ever forget their origin? Yet Gun’s name remained as it was, never elevated to the status of emperor. These rites of the Two Emperors and Three Kings have been practiced for ten thousand generations without flaw.

King Gaozong of Shang said: "In Yue, there was a pheasant crying out." Zu Ji admonished the king, saying: "Only when the former kings are first revered can affairs be properly ordered. Heaven watches over the people below and upholds their righteousness." Alas!

The king, in revering the people, recognizes that none are not the offspring of heaven, and no ritual should be more lavish than that of familial devotion. The record states: Examining the lineage above Gaozong, Zu Ding passed the throne to Nan Geng, who then passed it to Yang Jia—both sons of Zu Ding. From there, through three successions—Pan Geng, Xiao Xin, and Xiao Yi—all were Zu Ding’s sons, with brothers succeeding one another. Only Gaozong, as the son of Xiao Yi, ascended the throne, thus validating Zu Ji’s admonition. *Tong* refers to the name of the expiatory sacrifice. Offerings were first made at the ancestral temple, then at the *mi* shrine—this was for Xiao Yi. It was then that the omen of the pheasant’s cry appeared, a warning from heaven to Wu Ding that could not have been more urgent.

The phrase *"none are not the offspring of heaven"* embodies the principle that one who succeeds another as heir assumes the role of their son. The statement *"no ritual should be more lavish than that of familial devotion"* underscores the duty to set aside personal ties to one’s kin. Though Gaozong was the rightful heir, continuing the line of his father’s mourning garments, with Yang Jia, Pan Geng, and Xiao Xin having reigned before him, even a slight excess in familial devotion would have invited portents of change. How could later generations fail to reflect on this—how could they fail to reflect?

The *Rites* record: When King Wen was heir apparent, he paid morning audience to King Ji three times. At the first cry of the pheasant, he dressed in court robes and, upon reaching the outer gate of the sleeping chambers, inquired of the inner attendant: "How is his health today?" The attendant replied, "Well." Only then did King Wen rejoice.

When midday arrived, he did as before. When evening came, he did as before. If there was any irregularity in his father’s health, the inner attendant would report it to King Wen, and King Wen’s countenance would grow troubled, his gait unsteady as though he could not walk properly. Only after King Ji resumed his meals would King Wen return to his usual demeanor. When the food was served, he first examined whether it was too hot or too cold; when the meal was finished, he inquired about what had been eaten. He would instruct the steward of the kitchen, saying, "Do not repeat the same dishes." The steward would reply, "Understood," and then withdraw. King Wu followed this practice as well, never presuming to exceed it.

The record states: Though this was an ordinary matter, it is said that "he never presumed to exceed it"—for the heart of a filial son knows no bounds, and if one goes too far, one may fall short instead. When Emperor Xiaozong of Song served Emperor Gaozong, father and son shared a chamber, even sleeping side by side on adjoining couches. They cut bamboo into tubes, hollowed out the center, placed a golden pellet inside, and passed it back and forth to inquire after each other’s well-being—this verged on the manner of a brother and sister, something even King Wen and King Wu would not have presumed to exceed.

*The Huainanzi* says: In serving King Wen, the Duke of Zhou acted without presuming to decide anything on his own; he undertook no task by his own authority. His bearing was as though he could not support his own robes; his words were as though they could not leave his mouth. He served King Wen with reverence, attentive and deferential, as though he could not bear the weight, as though he feared to lose it—this was true filial devotion.

The record states: Though the Duke of Zhou had the authority to establish institutions, it is said that "he acted without presuming to decide anything on his own, undertook no task by his own authority"—why? For rites and music are matters of the court, and one may exercise authority over them. But the principles of one’s will and conduct are the standards of life and death, and cannot be decided by oneself alone. Only after three years without change can they endure for ten thousand generations. If there is even a single day of self-will, it is no longer lifelong devotion. This is the difference between family and state, which a filial son must understand.

*The Classic of Filial Piety* says: In former times, the Duke of Zhou offered sacrifices at the suburban altar to Hou Ji, associating him with Heaven, and honored King Wen in the Bright Hall, associating him with the Supreme Emperor. Thus, within the Four Seas, all came to offer sacrifices according to their duties.

*The Book of Songs* says:
*"I present my offerings, with sheep and oxen,
May Heaven protect them."
Following the model of King Wen’s institutions,
He pacified the Four Quarters.
Oh, the blessings of King Wen!
He received Heaven’s favor.
Day and night I serve,
In awe of Heaven’s majesty,
Thus preserving it."*

Master Cheng said: All things originate from Heaven; man originates from his ancestors. Therefore, at the winter solstice, we sacrifice to Heaven and associate our ancestors with it—for the winter solstice is the beginning of qi, when all things take form from the Emperor, and man takes form from his father. Thus, in late autumn, we offer sacrifices to the Emperor and associate our fathers with it—for late autumn is the time when things reach completion.

Master Chen said: Heaven is the Emperor. We call it "Heaven" in the suburban sacrifice to honor it, and thus associate Hou Ji with it. Hou Ji is distant, and associating him with the suburban sacrifice also honors him. In the Bright Hall, we call it "the Emperor" to draw near to it, and thus associate King Wen with it—for King Wen is near. Honoring the honorable and cherishing the cherished—this is the perfection of the Zhou Way. Thus, the suburban sacrifice is an ancient rite, while the Bright Hall is an institution of the Zhou. The Duke of Zhou established it on the basis of principle.

The record states: Observing the sacrifices in the Bright Hall, it was not merely an empty ritual. It is said: "Following the model of King Wen’s institutions." This was the true meaning of associating one’s father with Heaven. Heaven is honored and cannot be surpassed, so it is said: "May they receive the offerings"—without presuming to add a single word. But for King Wen, there were countless ways to emulate him. Heaven requires no praise; emulating King Wen is how one emulates Heaven. The final line speaks of awe for Heaven’s majesty but does not mention King Wen—this is because reverence is unified. Awe for Heaven is awe for King Wen. Heaven and King Wen are one.

Later generations have also practiced the sacrifices of the Bright Hall and the suburban altar, yet disputes arise endlessly, and their governance does not match antiquity. This is because they honor with empty rituals rather than elevating them with true devotion.

It is also said: "May I ask how the virtue of the sage surpasses filial piety?" From the moment of birth, one is nurtured at one’s parents’ knees, and serving one’s parents is called reverence. The sage uses reverence to teach respect and closeness to teach love. The sage’s teachings are accomplished without severity; his governance is orderly without harshness—what he relies upon is fundamental.

The Way of father and son is the nature of Heaven. The duty of ruler and minister is also a principle. Nothing is greater than the continuation of one’s parents’ life; nothing is weightier than the oversight of ruler and parent. Thus, one who does not love his parents but loves others is called perverse in virtue; one who does not respect his parents but respects others is called perverse in ritual. To act with compliance yet produce rebellion—people have no model. It is not a matter of goodness but of vicious conduct. Even if one attains it, the noble person does not value it.

The noble person is not like this. In speech, he considers what can be followed; in conduct, what can bring joy. His virtue and righteousness are worthy of honor; his actions are worthy of emulation. His demeanor is worthy of observation; his advancement and withdrawal are measured. When he governs his people, they revere and love him, follow and imitate him. Thus, he can perfect his moral teachings and carry out his policies.

*The Book of Songs* says:
*"The good and noble man,
His demeanor is never improper."*

The record states: This teaching of respect and love is the model for filial sons of all generations. Associating one’s father with Heaven is the greatest ritual, not easily matched. With King Wen in the heavens, shining upon all, he is not easily emulated. Yet from birth, one is of the same body yet divided, and this division is most reverent, never transgressed. Its Way is most lofty, with none to question it. If one can be diligent in speech and conduct, governance and affairs, demeanor and advancement, then what one models and emulates lies within these bounds.

*The Book of Songs* does not say:
*"Extending above and below,
Ascending and descending in his house."*

Those who undertake the affairs of honoring ancestors and aligning with Heaven must take this as their model.

*The Testamentary Charge* states: On the day *yichou*, the King passed away. The Grand Protector commanded Zhong Huan and Nangong Mao to instruct Lü Ji, Marquis of Qi, to take two halberds and a hundred tiger-warriors to receive Prince Zhao outside the Southern Gate. They escorted him into the Wing Chamber, where he mourned in the ancestral hall. On the day *dingmao*, the decree was issued to create the ritual tablets. Seven days later, on *guiyou*, the Chief Minister commanded the officers to prepare timber, while the Di people arranged the tattered curtains and embroidered robes. The window faced south, layered with thick bamboo mats, worn-out hems, and a patterned jade armrest. To the west of the eastern sequence, facing east, were layered mattresses with embroidered hems and a cowrie-shell armrest. To the east of the western sequence, facing west, were layered fine mats with painted hems and a carved jade armrest. In the western corridor, facing south, were layered bamboo mats with black-fringed hems and a lacquered armrest. Five tiers of jade treasures were displayed: the Red Blade, the Great Instructions, the Grand Jade Disc, the *gui* and *ying* jades in the western sequence; the Great Jade, the Yi Jade, the Heavenly Sphere, and the *River Chart* in the eastern sequence. The robes for the *Yin* dance, the great cowrie shells, and the *jian* drums were in the western chamber; the halberd of *Dui*, the bow of *He*, and the bamboo arrows of *Chui* were in the eastern chamber. The great linchpin was placed before the guest steps, the threaded linchpin before the rear steps, the first linchpin before the left study, and the second linchpin before the right study. Two men in sparrow-crested caps held *hui* batons, standing within the *Bi* Gate; four men in *jing* caps held halberds with upward blades, flanking the two sets of steps. One man in a ceremonial cap held a *liu* axe, standing in the eastern hall; one held an *xie* axe, standing in the western hall; one held a *fu* axe, standing at the eastern eaves; one held a *ju* axe, standing at the western eaves; and one held a *rui* axe, standing beside the steps. The King, wearing a hempen cap and tattered robes, ascended by the guest steps. The ministers, lords, and nobles, wearing hempen caps and ant-patterned robes, entered and took their positions. The Grand Protector, Grand Scribe, and Grand Master all wore hempen caps and vermilion robes. The Grand Protector bore the great jade tablet, and the High Priest presented the jade scepter, ascending by the rear steps. The Grand Scribe held the ritual documents, ascending by the guest steps. The King was presented with the decree, which read: "The August Ancestor leans upon the jade armrest, proclaiming the final mandate. We command you to inherit the teachings, to oversee the realm of Zhou, to follow the great statutes, and to harmonize all under Heaven, thereby responding to and extolling the luminous instructions of Wen and Wu." The King bowed twice, rose, and replied: "I, this insignificant one, how could I govern the four quarters and revere the awe of Heaven?" He then received the jade scepter, performing three overnight vigils, three sacrifices, and three proclamations. The High Priest declared the offering, and the Grand Protector received the scepter, descended, washed his hands, and presented a different scepter with a libation of jade. He handed it to the Ritual Master, who bowed, and the King returned the bow. The Grand Protector received the scepter, made an offering, and placed it in the Ritual Master’s care, who bowed again, and the King returned the bow. The Grand Protector descended and withdrew. The feudal lords exited and waited outside the court gate.

The record states: This was the accession of the Son of Heaven, a model for all generations under Heaven. The Master took this ritual as his standard when composing the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. The Son of Heaven, receiving the Mandate from Heaven, differs immeasurably from the feudal lords. Yet in embodying the origin, upholding the great unity, and rectifying the Five Beginnings, the lords and the Son of Heaven are as one. Thus, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* records the first year of a lord’s reign as "the Duke acceded to his position," preserving the legacy of Cheng and Kang, Zhou and Shao. Alas! Later generations, such as Emperor Wu of Han and Emperor Taizong of Tang, knew of the *Testamentary Charge* but not of the tiger-warriors and halberds receiving the heir outside the Southern Gate, nor of the rites demonstrating the preciousness of assuming the throne. Zhou Bo and Di Renjie knew to welcome the crown prince but not of the ritual tablets, the display of jades and treasures, or the decree commanding adherence to the great statutes. When Emperor Taizu of Song passed away, even the palace attendants were kept uninformed, giving rise to endless doubts across the ages—how could this harmonize the people of all under Heaven? As for those who enthrone others while rejecting their fathers and elder brothers, or who act as regents for sons, such cases are frequently condemned in the annals. Compared to these rites, the difference is as vast as between a path and a courtyard.

*The Meaning of the Capping Ceremony* states: What makes a person human is ritual and propriety. The beginning of ritual and propriety lies in rectifying one’s bearing, aligning one’s countenance, and ordering one’s speech. When bearing is rectified, countenance aligned, and speech ordered, then ritual and propriety are complete, enabling the proper ordering of ruler and minister, the intimacy of father and son, and the harmony of elder and younger. When ruler and minister are proper, father and son intimate, and elder and younger harmonious, then ritual and propriety are established. Thus, the cap is donned only after the robes are complete; the robes are complete only after bearing is rectified, countenance aligned, and speech ordered. Therefore, it is said: The capping is the beginning of ritual. For this reason, the sage-kings of antiquity valued the capping ceremony. In the capping ritual, divination is performed to select the guest, showing reverence for the capping. Reverence for the capping shows the importance of ritual, and the importance of ritual is the foundation of the state. Thus, the proper son is capped in the rear chamber to manifest succession. He is toasted in the guest position to signify his maturity. The threefold capping, each more honorable than the last, symbolizes his aspirations. After capping, he is given a style name to honor his designation. Therefore, the ancients valued the capping ceremony and performed it in the ancestral temple. Performing it in the temple shows the importance of the occasion. Honoring the occasion without presuming its importance demonstrates humility and reverence for one’s ancestors.

The record states: For a son toward his parents, there are three mornings of mourning and three years of mourning garments. For parents toward their son, there are three cappings, showing the ritual due to the son. Thus, though the capping may differ, the proper son and the feudal lords alike are capped in the rear chamber. When Ji Wuzi requested to borrow the regalia for his brothers’ states and was capped in the temple of Duke Cheng of Wei, this was not in accordance with ritual. If it was to show respect for the command of a great state, it could be considered commendable; but in the case of Duke Xiang of Lu, it was not permissible.

*The Discourses of the States* records: When Zhao Wenzi was capped, he visited Le Wuzi, who said: "How splendid! In the past, when I had the honor of serving Duke Zhuang, it was glorious indeed. Yet I did not know its substance—let us focus on substance."

When he visited Zhonghang Xuanzi, Xuanzi said: "How splendid! What a pity—I am already old."

When he visited Fan Wenzi, Wenzi said: "Now you must be vigilant. The worthy grow more cautious when favor comes, while the unworthy grow arrogant with favor. Thus, enlightened kings reward remonstrance. If a minister grows complacent, the king punishes him."

When he visited Bu Jubo, Jubo said: "How splendid! Yet the young are not as accomplished as the old in many ways."

When he visited Han Xianzi, Xianzi said: "Be vigilant. This is what it means to become a man. To become a man lies in beginning with goodness. If one begins with goodness, goodness advances and evil does not. How could it arise? If one begins with evil, evil advances and goodness does not—how could it arise? It is like the growth of plants and trees, each according to its kind. A man’s capping is like a palace’s walls and roof. Once swept and cleared, what more can be added?"

When he visited Zhi Wuzi, Wuzi said: "Exert yourself. Chengzi followed the former will to assist the late lord, guided by principle and governed with order—could this not be called cultured? Xuanzi exhausted his remonstrance to Xiang and Ling, enduring hatred for his admonitions and advancing without fear of death—could this not be called loyal? Exert yourself. With Xuanzi’s loyalty and Chengzi’s culture, serving a lord would not fail."

When he visited Ruo Chengshuzi, Chengshuzi said: "Yet the young who hold office are many—how can I make room for you?"

When he visited Wen Jizi, Jizi said: "Whom you fall short of, you may seek to emulate."

When he spoke with Zhang Lao, Zhang Lao said: "Excellent! Following Lebo’s words can amplify Fanshu’s teachings, amplify Hanzi’s warnings, and bring things to completion. The aspiration lies with you. If not for the threefold convergence of these men’s words, what would there be to recount? Your Way is well-guided—it is the late lord’s sheltering care for you."

The record states: Observing the words of Jin’s great ministers, one knows the esteem for ritual in that era. The capping is the beginning of ritual. Fan Wenzi, young and fatherless, weak and unestablished, was held to the rites of being a son, a younger brother, a minister, and a youth—standards even more distinct than others. Yet arrogance, extravagance, and recklessness inevitably arise. These gentlemen, having petitioned to restore his rank and fief, may be called harmonious and reverent in duty. But if admonitions to goodness go unheard and loyal compliance remains incomplete, how can he compare to his forebears? With Le Fanshu’s encouragement ahead and Cheng Ji and Zhang Lao’s reinforcement behind—how fine! This is the model of ritual. Wenzi’s standing was no accident.

*The Spring and Autumn Annals* records: In the second year of Duke Min, summer, fifth month, day *yiyou*, a lucky sacrifice was offered to Duke Zhuang. In the eighth year of Duke Xi, autumn, seventh month, a sacrifice was offered in the Grand Temple to convey the lady. The record states: This is the foremost principle of *The Spring and Autumn Annals*. The governance of the Three Dynasties shared the same end, with ritual and music as their urgency. Ritual is not made by Heaven nor sprung from Earth—it arises from human sentiment. Sacrifice follows the will of the divine emperors. What is the meaning of a lucky sacrifice to Duke Zhuang? What is the propriety of conveying the lady? What is taken from the halls of the Three Families? The Master’s censure runs deep. Ai Jiang’s licentiousness and deceit honored her husband’s sacrifices, yet Duke Xi later defied righteousness and human feeling to exalt his mother. Neither lord nor minister saw this as wrong; the whole state knew no better. Thus, the Master later said: "If this can be tolerated, what cannot?" This remark arose from such circumstances—not merely for the eight rows of dancers in the Ji family’s courtyard. Readers must consider this together to grasp the profound intent of the Sage’s heart. Yet Hu’s commentary takes "conveying the living" as the principle, failing to examine this.

*The Commentaries on the Ritual Classics* record: Confucius sat in attendance to Duke Ai. The Duke said: "I wish to speak." Confucius replied: "In ancient times, the enlightened kings of the Three Dynasties invariably revered their wives and children—there was a Way in this. The wife is the host of kinship—how could one not revere her? The child is the descendant of kinship—how could one not revere him? Thus, the noble man reveres all. Revering the self is greatest. The self is the branch of kinship—how could one not revere it? To fail in revering the self is to harm kinship; to harm kinship is to harm the root; to harm the root, the branches perish with it. From self to self, from child to child, from consort to consort. If the lord cultivates these three, great transformation will spread throughout the world."

The record states: This passage speaks of the father’s reverence for his child, followed by the child’s reverence for his father.

The Duke said: "May I ask what it means to revere the self?"
Confucius replied: "If a noble man’s words err, the people take them as rhetoric; if his actions err, the people take them as models. If a noble man’s words do not exceed rhetoric and his actions do not exceed models, the hundred clans obey without command, reverent and respectful. This may be called revering the self. One who can revere the self can thereby complete kinship."

The Duke said: "May I ask what it means to complete kinship?"
Confucius replied: "The noble man is the completed name of a person. When the hundred clans ascribe the name to him, calling him the son of a noble man, this completes his kinship as a noble man. This is to complete the name of his kinship."

The Duke said: "May I ask what it means to complete the self?"
Confucius replied: "When one’s conduct does not exceed things, this is called completing the self. Not exceeding things accords with the Way of Heaven."

The Duke said: "Why does the noble man value the Way of Heaven?"
Confucius replied: "He values its ceaselessness. As the saying goes, the moon and sun follow one another east and west without ceasing—this is the Way of Heaven. Unobstructed yet able to enter—this is the Way of Heaven."

The Way of Heaven is to accomplish things through non-action; to illuminate them after they are accomplished—this too is the Way of Heaven.

The Duke said: "I am dull-witted and troubled, yet you have set your mind to instruct me."
Confucius, startled, moved from his mat and replied: "The humane person does not exceed things; the filial child does not exceed things. Thus, when the humane person serves their parents, it is as if serving Heaven; when serving Heaven, it is as if serving their parents. This is what it means for the filial child to complete the self."

The Duke said: "Having heard these words, I fear there is no remedy for my future faults."
Confucius replied: "That Your Highness has reached this understanding is this minister’s good fortune."

It is recorded: This speaks to the utmost perfection of ritual. When the hawk first cries, all wash and rinse—such is the conduct of the common people. To complete the self and complete the name is the task of the noble person. Extending this to the ceaseless Way of Heaven, to utmost sincerity without rest—this is the Way of father and son, which is the Way of Heaven. Heaven bestows its perfect goodness upon the father, and only then upon the child. Thus, the nature of father and son is the very nature of Heaven. When the noble person fully realizes their nature and stands alongside Heaven and Earth, they fully realize the Way of the father. In fully realizing the Way of the father, the Way of Heaven is nothing beyond this. Truly, to serve parents as if serving Heaven, and to serve Heaven as if serving parents—these two are one yet two, two yet one. Therefore, one is called both a filial child and a humane person, and only thus is the utmost of the rites of father and son achieved. As for stepping forward in shoes or responding with reverent words—these are not worth discussing.

It is further said: *The Doctrine of the Mean* discusses the ceaseless Way of Heaven, and King Wen was perfectly attuned to the Way of Heaven, also without ceasing. It is also said: "Unseen, yet manifest; unmoving, yet transforming; non-acting, yet accomplishing." All these teachings derive from Confucius’ response to Duke Ai. This is the ultimate of sagely transformation and the subtlest mystery of perfect virtue. No wonder Duke Ai, dull and benighted, lost himself upon hearing these words and could not be blamed for his faults. How lamentable!

Meng Yizi asked about the filial son, saying: "Do not transgress." Fan Chi drove the carriage and reported this to Confucius, saying: "Mengsun asked me about filial piety, and I replied: 'Do not transgress.'" Fan Chi asked: "What does this mean?" The Master said: "In life, serve them with the rites; in death, bury them with the rites; sacrifice to them with the rites."

The Record states: Observing the institutions of Chengzhou, one may glimpse the purport of "do not transgress." When King Wen was crown prince, he paid court to King Ji three times a day. King Wu followed this practice without daring to exceed it—this is the rite of serving in life. If the father was a grandee and the son a knight, the burial was conducted as for a grandee, but the sacrifice as for a knight—this is the rite of burial in death. If the father was a knight and the son a grandee, the burial was conducted as for a knight, but the sacrifice as for a grandee—this is the rite of sacrifice. Yet when the dynasty declined, grandees employed ritual music, and vassals wielded state authority, so that serving in life no longer followed the rites. They gazed at the pillars and set up the *bo* instrument, chanted the *Yong* ode to conclude the repast—thus burial and sacrifice no longer followed the rites. Yet how could this be altered by inferiors? Hence the saying arose as it did.

It is further said: "Let all officials and commoners in the realm, upon receiving notice, attend the mourning for three days, all removing their mourning garments to undertake the funeral affairs. Those in mourning attire shall not wear silk sashes or belts, nor exceed three inches in width; they shall not use cloth-covered carriages or weapons, nor wail in mourning within the palace halls." Alas! This long-standing doctrine of thinness as the Way has obscured that the mourning for parents—from beginning to end, with grief, sorrow, and anguish—arises naturally, not from contrivance or artifice. Though the Emperor deeply understood the former, he failed to perceive the latter. Moreover, Emperor Jing’s nature inclined toward thinness, and Empress Dowager Dou favored the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. From ruler to subject, from high to low, all regarded this doctrine as the most proper and unchanging Way, an immutable law for ten thousand generations. Thus it was resolutely implemented. People, unaware of the reasons, merely blamed Emperor Jing, not realizing that in his heart, he felt no unease. Had a Mencius arisen in that era to expound profoundly on the original goodness of human nature, and only then discussed the three-year mourning period—shared by the Son of Heaven and the commoner alike, as in the Three Dynasties—then even with an imperial edict in place, Emperor Jing might have felt uneasy in his heart, and perhaps, by some chance, been moved to change. Alas! How could such an opportunity ever be recovered?

Thus I have recorded these accounts in full to demonstrate how the teachings of the sages and worthies, as opposed to heterodox doctrines, bear so profoundly upon the moral order of the world.

King Hejian of Han was a great-grandson of King Hui and King Xian. Among the feudal lords of the two capitals, many were arrogant and dissolute, their reputations and virtues tarnished—only King Xian and King Hui upheld proper conduct. When King Xian’s mother passed away, he observed the full mourning rites with utmost propriety. As soon as the Emperor issued an edict to praise him, it read: “King Hejian has mourned his grandmother with such exemplary devotion, completing the three-year mourning period, that he serves as a model for the imperial clan. For this, he shall be enfeoffed with an additional ten thousand households.”

Note: King Hui was a great-grandson of Emperor Jing. By this time in the Han, the practice of substituting days for months in mourning had persisted for nearly four generations. That King Hui alone adhered to the proper rites was a rarity throughout the Han dynasty. Thus, it is recorded.

*Hongdao Lu*, Volume 31 concludes.
*Hongdao Lu*, Volume 32 begins.

**Rites: The Rites Between Father and Son**

From *The History of Jin*: When Emperor Wen passed away, the entire realm observed three days of mourning. Emperor Wu also followed the precedents of Han and Wei: after the burial, mourning was set aside, though he continued to wear plain robes and white hempen caps, slept on lowered mats, and abstained from rich foods. The Grand Tutor Sima Fu and others memorialized:

“Your ministers have heard that the rituals and regulations of the past varied in elaboration according to the times. The dynasties of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou did not all follow the same customs. The Great Jin, inheriting the legacy of Han and Wei, has both reformed and preserved their traditions, aiming only to foster moral transformation. Thus, it has not been possible to return entirely to the simplicity of antiquity or emulate the rituals of the earliest ages.

“Now that Your Majesty has deigned to follow the Han and Wei precedent of abbreviated mourning to address the needs of the times, yet personally embodies the utmost filial piety—his grief exceeding all bounds—even the mourning of King Wuding in the Shang era or the conduct of Zengzi and Min Ziqian as commoners would not surpass it.

“At present, the southern barbarians remain unsubdued, governance is yet to be fully established, and the myriad affairs of state weigh heavily, demanding constant mental exertion. Your ministers humbly submit that Your Majesty should resume the attire of the imperial wardrobe, allow the inner palace to restore its furnishings, and permit the imperial kitchens to reinstate the usual provisions, in accordance with the established regulations.”

The Emperor issued a decree in reply:
“Whenever I reflect upon the unseen realm, I am pained that I cannot remain in mourning weeds upon the straw mat to preserve this sorrow. That I must now eat fine rice and wear embroidered silks truly fills me with anguish and indignation—how could this bring solace? I have inherited this tradition from the house of Zhou, and its observance has endured for generations. How could I, in a single day, cast aside this devotion to my departed father? I have already yielded much in this matter. Let us consider Confucius’ response to Zai Wo and refrain from further debate.”

As he spoke, his grief overwhelmed him, and he repeated, “What is to be done? What is to be done?”

Sima Fu and the others submitted another memorial:
“At present, the weapons of war have not yet been laid down, and military affairs remain unresolved. The weight of governance is immense, and the realm vast. Yet Your Majesty, in the dignity of his imperial station, observes the rites of a commoner—wearing coarse mourning garb, sleeping on a mat of rushes, drinking plain water, and eating simple fare. His inner sorrow is profound, and his outward appearance shows the toll of grief. Yet he labors tirelessly over the myriad affairs of state, rising at dawn and retiring late, humbling himself to receive his ministers, often too preoccupied to eat. Such exertion is extreme.

“Thus, your ministers tremble with unease, truly fearing that Your Majesty’s vital energy will be depleted, to the detriment of great matters. We implore Your Majesty to heed our humble counsel and comfort the heart of the Empress Dowager.”

The Emperor issued another decree:
“Upon reviewing your memorial again, my sorrow only deepens, and I cannot restrain myself. The three-year mourning period is a universal rite since antiquity. Truly, the sage established it to give expression to grief, enacting it with clarity and forbearance. As the spirit of the departed recedes into the distance, there is no one to whom I may address my lament. Though my devotion may be slight, to eat fine foods and wear fine clothes is unbearable. It is not fitting to revisit this matter, for it would only wound my heart anew. Let the discussion end here.”

Thus, the Emperor observed the full three-year mourning period.

Note: The three-day mourning observed throughout the realm upon Emperor Wen’s passing was the customary practice before the abdication of the throne. That Emperor Wu followed the Han and Wei precedent of setting aside mourning after the burial was the established ritual after abdication. Yet he did not go beyond wearing plain robes, a white cap, sleeping on lowered mats, and abstaining from rich foods—thus, what the Emperor preserved was akin to the “mourning of the heart.” He had never intended to observe the full three-year mourning with unhemmed sackcloth. Why, then, did Sima Fu and the others persist so earnestly?

At that time, public discourse had lost its vigor. People indulged in wine and revelry, scorned ritual and law, and upon the death of a parent, felt no sorrow. Even a single day of grief and lamentation like the Emperor’s—though not fully in accord with ancient rites—was enough to astonish the realm. Moreover, Confucius rebuked Zai Wo’s question, for no ritual is greater than that of the court, and none more weighty than the rites of abdication. Though the Jin had not yet formally ended the Wei’s abdication, they had already received its resplendent regalia—the black robes and red raven emblems, the display of titles and institutions, the interplay of bells, jades, and silks. Even if one wished to abandon these, who would permit it?

If one wished to emulate Emperor Wu of Jin—strictly upholding his ministerial duty, vowing unwavering loyalty, then retiring to a mourning hut, wearing sackcloth and eating plain fare, reviving the spirit of Zengzi and Min Ziqian while rejecting the conduct of Zai Wo—who could prevent it? Yet at the dawn of a new dynasty, to feign abstention from fine rice and embroidered silks—whom would one deceive? Deceive Heaven?

The Central Army General Yang Hu said to Fu Xuan: “The three-year mourning period, though a lofty rite, has long been observed. Now, the Emperor’s filial devotion is profound. Though his mourning garb has been set aside, he truly observes the mourning rites. If this could restore the ancient laws of the former kings, would that not be excellent?”

Fu Xuan replied: “The practice of substituting days for months has endured for centuries. To suddenly revive antiquity would be difficult.”

Yang Hu said: “If we cannot make the realm conform to ritual, at least let the Emperor observe the full mourning. Would that not be better?”

Fu Xuan replied: “If the Emperor does not set aside mourning while the realm does, this would mean there are fathers and sons but no longer rulers and ministers.”

Thus, the matter was dropped.

Note: The words of the Central Army General may well have been a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. By then, the Wei had already reformed its old ways, and the Jin was newly established. The spirit of Ji Kang and Ruan Ji could not be heard in the latter ages—how much less in a fledgling dynasty? Had this proposal been presented to Emperor Wu, he might have heeded it, establishing it as a fixed institution, recording it in the ritual codes, and promulgating it throughout the realm. Though it might not have fully restored the ancient ways of the former kings, it would at least have avoided the excesses of vulgar custom.

Alas, Fu Xuan’s foresight did not extend so far. Thus did the customs of Wang and He take hold, and the Jiangzuo court follow in their wake. Not only was the three-year mourning period left unobserved, but even for the nine-month and five-month rites, music was not set aside. For this, the ministers cannot escape their responsibility.

In the fourth year of Taishi, when Empress Dowager Wang, the elder sister of the Jin ruler, passed away, the Jin sovereign observed mourning in strict accordance with ancient ritual. After the burial, the officials petitioned for him to remove his mourning garments. The imperial edict declared: “To receive a lifetime of love yet offer no lasting repayment—how can the heart bear it?” The officials persisted in their request, and the edict replied: “The concern lies not in insufficient filial devotion, but in the fear of self-injury through grief. The ritual codes of former dynasties varied in substance and form; why must we be bound by recent conventions, leaving the full expression of mourning incomplete?” The ministers continued their pleas until at last he consented—yet still he wore plain garments for the full three years.

Note: The empress was the daughter of Wang Su. She recited the *Book of Poetry* and the *Analects* and was especially learned in mourning rites. Thus Emperor Wu remarked: “I come from a family of scholars, where the transmission of ritual has long been preserved—how could it be abandoned in a single day?” His upbringing in such matters was indeed far-reaching. Can this be compared to Empress Dou or Emperor Jing, who esteemed the Yellow Emperor and Laozi while disparaging Confucian practices?

*The History of Wei* records: In the ninth month of the fourteenth year of Taihe, when Empress Dowager Feng passed away, the Wei sovereign took no broth for five days, and his grief exceeded ritual propriety. Yang Zhuang of Huayin, a clerk of the Central Bureau, admonished him: “The rites of the sage-kings teach that one must not destroy one’s nature through mourning. Even if Your Majesty wishes to surpass all ages in virtue, what of the ancestral temples?” Moved by his words, the emperor took a single measure of congee.

Note: The sovereign’s grief was truly the work of innate nature, not the result of forced restraint or pretense. To suggest he sought to surpass all ages in virtue is mistaken. Thereupon the princes and dukes submitted a memorial requesting the timely designation of the burial site. The edict replied: “In serving the coffin, I still hope for the return of her spirit. To speak of moving the mountain tomb—how can I bear to hear it?” In the tenth month, after repeated petitions from the princes and dukes, she was interred at Yonggu Mausoleum.

Note: The rites prescribe that feudal lords be buried after five months, and after burial, they dwell in a thatched hut outside the central gate. Though Emperor Wen of Wei’s words did not fully grasp the comprehensive intent of ritual, they nonetheless unwittingly aligned with its enduring spirit. Pressed by repeated memorials—what a pity!

The Grand Commandant Pi and others advanced, saying: “We, your ministers, are aged and decrepit, having served successive sagely rulers. We are somewhat familiar with the former affairs of the state. We wish to restrain our deepest emotions and uphold the ancient canons.”

The Lord of Wei replied: “Our ancestors devoted themselves wholly to martial strategy and did not cultivate civil teachings. Now I, looking up to receive sagely instruction, hope to practice the ancient Way. Yet when I weigh the times and compare matters, they differ from those of former ages.”

*Recorded:* This is precisely what is meant by ‘having something to rely upon.’ Whenever the state’s actions and movements cannot proceed as desired, it is invariably due to such arguments. If not for a ruler of heroic mettle, who could avoid being misled?

The Lord of Wei continued: “I have considered that in the middle ages, the three-year mourning was not fully observed. This was because the former sovereign had departed the world, and the succeeding ruler had just ascended the throne. The ruler’s virtue had not yet spread, nor had the ministers’ devotion fully taken root. Thus, he donned a single robe and crown and performed the accession rites. Though I am truly lacking in virtue, I have held the throne for over twelve years—long enough for the myriad people to know they have a lord. If on this day I do not fulfill even a single moment of longing and filial devotion, causing both emotion and ritual to be lost, would that not be deeply regrettable? My lingering in mourning garb and refusal to heed your request arise from a heart that cannot bear it—not merely to avoid idle reproach.”

*Recorded:* Here, one sees even more clearly his understanding of human sentiment and clarity regarding the greater good. He is no careless, impulsive ruler driven by mere emotion. Even the heroic rulers of antiquity—how could they surpass him?

The assembled ministers spoke again: “The spring and autumn sacrifices of the Black Millet cannot be abandoned or neglected.”

The Lord of Wei replied: “In the former court, these rites were conducted by officials, but I, having received my late mother’s instruction, have begun to offer reverence in person. Now, with Heaven’s punishment having descended and both humans and spirits bereft of support, I imagine the spirits of the ancestral temples would also repay the former sacrifices. If we were to proceed with offerings, I fear it would contravene the hidden will of the unseen. Moreover, in ordinary times, the dukes and ministers often declare that the Four Seas are at peace and that ritual and music are daily renewed, such that we may compare favorably with the Tang and Yu. Yet now you seek to forcibly wrest my resolve, making me no better than the Wei and Jin. Why?”

*Recorded:* The three-year mourning is the great boundary for a filial child—once passed, it cannot be retrieved or regretted. The four seasonal rites are the state’s regular affairs—they may be remedied and restored later. The emperor may truly be said to be unconfused about what is urgent and what is not.

The Secretariat Drafter Li Biao added: “Though the realm is now well-ordered, the lands south of the Yangtze have not submitted, nor have the northern deserts acknowledged allegiance. We ministers still harbor concerns about unforeseen dangers.”

The Lord of Wei replied: “The Duke of Lu wore mourning garb while leading troops to war, and the Marquis of Jin donned black sackcloth to defeat the enemy—these were certainly approved by the sages. If unforeseen dangers arise, even if I were to cast aside mourning cords, there would be no fault, let alone wearing mourning hemp. How can we, in a time of peace and security, anticipate matters of military campaign and thereby abandon the observances of mourning?”

*Recorded:* Later ages applied the exception for war to times of no conflict. Even Confucians could not avoid this—are they not the guilty successors of Emperor Wen of Wei?

The Grand Commandant Pi and others spoke again: “In the house of Wei, after major taboos, it was customary to welcome the spirits from the west and exorcise evil to the north within three months, performing all the auspicious rites.”

The Lord of Wei replied: “If one serves the spirits with the Dao, they will come of their own accord without being summoned. If one loses benevolence and righteousness, even if welcomed, they will not arrive. These are not rites to be performed even in ordinary times—how much less in mourning?”

*Recorded:* This is how the emperor resolutely adopted the Xia and transformed the Yi. Should the various ministers not feel ashamed? Should they not feel ashamed?

The emperor further questioned the Minister of Works You Minggen, Gao Wen, and others: “The sages established the rites for the end of weeping and the changes in mourning garments, all to gradually withdraw from grief. Now, within ten days, you speak of immediately adopting auspicious rites—can this not be injurious?”

They replied: “To inter the deceased within a full month and adopt auspicious rites immediately after burial—this is the decree of the Golden Tablet.”

The emperor said: “The decree of the Golden Tablet and the petitions of the various ministers exist for this reason: to prevent the neglect of state affairs. Yet I dare not remain silent and idle, allowing governance to fall into disorder. I only wish to wear mourning garments, abandon auspicious rites, and express full sorrow on the first and fifteenth of each month. If this is not permitted, then I shall remove my mourning robes, remain in silent reverence, and entrust governance to the Chief Minister. Between these two options, let the dukes and ministers choose.”

Minggen said: “If you remain silent and inactive, great governance will be neglected. Bowing to your sagely will, we request that you continue in mourning attire.”

*Recorded:* The Golden Tablet of Wei is akin to the posthumous edicts of Han. The Tablet states that burial should occur within a full month and auspicious rites adopted immediately after—this mirrors the edicts that replaced months with days. Yet whether such decrees were followed or not depended entirely on the depth of sincerity, and thus practices varied. Emperor Wen of Wei, having inherited a grand legacy from his youth, early displayed a reverent and sagely demeanor. Without the guidance of enlightened teachers or the instruction of worthy tutors, he still aspired to the lofty examples of human relations and enacted deeds surpassing even ancient precedents. Observing his repeated questions and answers, one sees how thoroughly he dispelled the doubts of his ministers and officials. With such resolve, what mourning rites could not be properly observed? Alas.

The empress dowager Feng’s usurpation of power was not the accumulation of a single morning, and her calamity had its gradual origins. With a grandson such as this, how could she bear to betray him—only to poison his father instead? I privately marvel that the emperor, though wise, perceptive, and keen, could not discern his father’s treachery. This was because the Wei court, still smarting from the disaster of Cui Hao, had adopted concealment as its guise. Lacking the records of a Dong Hu, and never receiving the urgent admonitions of a mentor, it was not until the *Tongyi* that the celestial portents were examined, subtly revealing the truth, while the *Gangmu* forthrightly documented the events. Alas, by then it was too late.

Thus, those who govern states and households should fear not concealment but ignorance, not subtlety but blindness. They must spare no concern for scruples, laying bare even the most hidden and arduous truths—for this is the very purpose. As a result, kindness was misdirected, and generosity bestowed where it did not belong. Across the span of thousands of years, in this one moment and this one affair, such a fate befell—could there be a greater sorrow in the fullest observance of ritual?

In the ninth month of the fifteenth year of Taihe, Emperor Xiaowen of Wei conducted the *xiang* sacrifice at the ancestral temple. The officials in charge presented the divination, to which the emperor replied: “The oracle speaks of seeking auspiciousness, yet this contradicts the devotion of reverent service and violates the heart’s eternal longing. Today, we shall simply use the day preceding the dark moon.” That night, he lodged in the temple and led his ministers in weeping.

Having changed into mourning attire—plain white hempen cap and belt, black shoes—his attendants likewise donned black headbands, coarse white silk robes, unlined garments, leather belts, and black shoes. They then wept through the night. At dawn, he exchanged his mourning dress for sacrificial robes: a plain white hempen cap, white silk edging, a deep robe, and hempen sandals, while his attendants removed their coarse headbands and replaced them with caps. After the sacrifice, they exited the temple and stood weeping for a long while before returning.

In the eleventh month, for the *tan* sacrifice, he first wore the single-layered *mian* crown. At the winter solstice, he offered sacrifice at the Circular Mound, then proceeded to the Bright Hall, ascending the Taihua Palace in a *tongtian* crown and crimson gauze robe to receive his ministers. The ritual music was hung but not performed. Leading the hundred officials, he escorted the spirit tablets to the new temple.

**Record states:** In the ninth month of the fourteenth year, *gengwu* (490 CE), Empress Dowager Feng of Wei passed away. In the ninth month of the fifteenth year, *xinwei* (491 CE), Emperor Xiaowen conducted the *xiang* sacrifice at the ancestral temple. In the eleventh month, he performed the *tan* sacrifice, then donned the imperial *gun* crown and transferred the new spirit tablets to the temple. Thus, barely fifteen months had passed—far from the ancient ritual of a twenty-seven-month mourning period with the *tan* sacrifice.

In the third year of Jiande (574 CE), the third month, Empress Dowager Chinu of Northern Zhou passed away. Emperor Gaozu of Zhou resided in a mourning hut, taking only a single *yi* of rice morning and evening. Prince Wei, Yuwen Zhi, secretly informed against Prince Qi, Yuwen Xian, for drinking wine and eating meat. The emperor replied: “Prince Qi and I differ. Though neither of us was born of the primary consort, it was only for my sake that he shaved his head and wore mourning. You should feel shame—you, the empress dowager’s own son, uniquely favored by her affection. Strive for yourself; do not compare with others.”

Upon the burial, the emperor walked barefoot to the mausoleum and issued an edict: “The three-year mourning period applies even to the Son of Heaven. Yet with military and state affairs pressing, I must personally attend court. As for the rites of wailing in sackcloth and the mourning hut, I shall follow the ancient canons to express boundless grief. All officials should adhere to the late empress’s decree.” After the burial, he ended the mourning, but the ministers firmly requested that he observe the full three-year period according to the provisional system. He refused, ultimately upholding the three-year mourning. For those within the five degrees of mourning, he also ordered adherence to ritual.

**Record states:** Hu氏 remarks: Emperor Gaozu of Zhou’s wearing of sackcloth and straw, completing the three-year mourning, was the most virtuous conduct. Yet his decree clarifying that the general mourning applied only to those within the five degrees of kinship, excluding all officials, fell short of the principle of proclaiming the observance to all under heaven. In my humble opinion, this is mistaken. The very reason for the endless debates and disputes is the desire to lead all under heaven in observing the three-year mourning. Human hearts differ, and kinship varies in closeness. Only after three years does a child leave its parents’ embrace—just as there are not two suns in the sky nor two kings among the people, so too the principle cannot be the same. To demand that all within the four seas rush about wailing as if for their own parents is not the way of the ancient sage-kings Yao and Shun. Neither Emperor Wen of Han nor Emperor Renzong of Song acted thus, nor did they extend it to the private kin of the empress dowager. Emperor Gaozu of Zhou did not abandon his words nor impose rigid expectations; he sought only to fully express his grief. The noble man should not lightly criticize him. As for matters of imperial tours and military campaigns, I find no merit in them.

From *The Tang History*: In the fourth year of the Zhenguan era, the Turkic khan Illig arrived in Chang’an. Emperor Taizong ascended the Shuntian Tower, displaying a grand array of cultural treasures before receiving him, and lodged him in the Court of the Imperial Stud, providing generous provisions. When the Retired Emperor (Gaozu) heard of Illig’s capture, he sighed and said, “When Emperor Gaozu of Han was besieged at Baideng, he could not exact vengeance. Now my son has destroyed the Turks—my trust has been placed in the right person. What more need I fear?” He then summoned the emperor, over ten eminent ministers, and the imperial princes and princesses to a feast in the Lingyan Pavilion. As the wine flowed freely, the Retired Emperor plucked the pipa, the emperor rose to dance, and the ministers and nobles took turns offering toasts until the revelry lasted deep into the night.

**Commentary:** The Retired Emperor rejoiced that the Turks’ destruction proved his trust well-placed—how devoid of human feeling! Confucius said, *“Repay resentment with uprightness, and virtue with virtue.”* The Turks had once lent their strength to the Tang. At first, they were trusted as heart and limb, allies as close as hand and arm. Yet once they relied on the Middle Kingdom’s might and emptied the southern lands of the steppe, the court—secure in its belief that no external threat remained—failed to see that the true danger lay within its own walls, deeper than any barbarian foe. Had the Retired Emperor remembered their former bond and urged the emperor to restore the fallen and revive the broken, returning their homeland and repatriating their people—as Mencius did when he installed a ruler before departing—then the distinction between Chinese and barbarian would have been clear, the Tang’s grace and might resplendent. Heaven’s favor upon the Tang would not have been as it was. Ignorant of this principle, in the span of a single turn, his descendants too grew cruel and violent, as if repaying past deeds. Thus, the Retired Emperor’s joy today—can it not become the lament of noble men in days to come?

In the twelfth month of the seventh year, the Emperor accompanied the Retired Emperor in hosting a feast at the former Weiyang Palace. The Retired Emperor commanded the Turkic khan, Jieli, to rise and dance, and then ordered the chieftain of the Southern Man, Feng Zhidai, to recite poetry. Thereupon, he laughed and said, "The Hu and the Yue are one family—such a thing has never been seen since ancient times." The Emperor, raising his goblet to offer longevity, replied, "Now that the four barbarians have submitted as vassals, it is all due to Your Majesty’s teachings; it is not something within the reach of my own wisdom or strength. In the past, Emperor Gaozu of Han also feasted with the Grand Emperor in this very palace, but he vainly boasted of his greatness—a course I do not emulate." The Retired Emperor was greatly pleased, and all in the hall cried, "Long live the Emperor!"

**Recorded Note:** Taizong deemed Han Gaozu’s conduct vain boasting—was he not right? The Turks, whom the Retired Emperor once served, were of a status utterly remote. Yet now, the Hu and Yue are one family—this is not merely a reversal of lord and vassal, but how much greater is the Emperor’s own boastfulness! The Emperor once regretted that Zilu could not carry grain in time—how could he now take pleasure in such a display of the Hu and Yue? As the *Book of Songs* says: *"Set forth the baskets and beans, drink in filial piety."* Only thus may the joy of heavenly bonds be fully realized; otherwise, it is all but vain boasting.

**From the *History of Song:*** In the seventh year of Tiansheng during the reign of Emperor Renzong, Empress Dowager Zhangxian was to receive court homage on the winter solstice. The Son of Heaven led the hundred officials in offering longevity. Fan Zhongyan, serving as Academician of the Secret Pavilion, submitted a memorial in earnest remonstrance: "In serving one’s parents at home, there are the rites of the family. To stand with the hundred officials, facing south to pay homage, cannot be made a precedent for later generations." Later, when Consort Chen, Lady Li, passed away, Lü Yijian, as chief minister, memorialized: "The rites should be observed with generosity." As a minister bearing the weight of the prime minister’s office, I should be consulted on all matters, whether internal or external. I request that mourning be declared, mourning garments donned, and the full funeral procession prepared." An edict was issued to breach the palace wall to carry out the coffin, but Yijian said, "Breaching the wall is not in accord with mourning rites; the coffin should exit through the Xihua Gate." The Consort had given birth to the sacred person of the Emperor, yet her funeral rites were not properly observed—someday, there will surely be those who bear the consequences. Do not think that Yijian does not speak out today." After the Empress Dowager’s death, Prince Jing, Yuan Yan, said to the Emperor: "Your Majesty was born of Consort Chen, who died an unnatural death." The Emperor then learned he was the son of Consort Chen and wept bitterly for days. He issued an edict reproaching himself, posthumously bestowed the title *Zhuangyi*, and, in great fortune, held a memorial service at Hongfu Temple. The coffin was opened, and when he beheld the Consort, her face, preserved with mercury, retained its jade-like luster as in life, and her robes and crown were those of an empress. The Emperor sighed and said, "Can the words of others truly be trusted?" He thereafter treated the Liu clan with even greater generosity.

The Record states: The former worthies have said: "During the more than ten years when Empress Dowager Zhangxian held court, the realm remained at peace, and much of the credit goes to Yijian." It also states: "When Fan Zhongyan discussed the rites for offering longevity, even Yan Shu found it obscure." Why was this? For the merit of protection is difficult for others to speak of, while the grace of nurture is boundless as the heavens. Thus Yijian insisted that the rites should be grand and solemn, thereby silently securing its foundation. As for Fang Zhong’s proposal to establish the Seven Temples, pay homage at the Grand Temple, and don the imperial robes, such precedents could not be allowed to grow. Thus Zhongyan firmly argued that the rites should be simplified, thereby preemptively ensuring a proper conclusion. Had these two men lived in Emperor Yingzong’s time, and had there been those who advocated for the Rites of the Pu Temple, the contentious debates might have been avoided. That their contributions were great, and their arguments difficult to fathom, may lie in this.

In the second year of the Zhiping era of Emperor Yingzong, an edict was issued to discuss the rites for honoring Pu Anyi, the Prince of Pu. Sima Guang, the Supervisor of the Remonstrance Bureau, knowing the Emperor would seek to exalt his birth father, once remarked during a memorial: "Emperor Xuan of Han, though a descendant of Emperor Zhaoxiao, never posthumously honored the Prince of Weichang or the Imperial Grandson Shi. Emperor Guangwu, who succeeded Emperor Yuan, also never honored his father, the Lord of Julu or Nandun. This is the model for all ages." Subsequently, Han Qi and others memorialized, requesting that the Emperor issue an edict for the Ministry of Rites and officials of the fifth rank and above to deliberate. The Hanlin Academician Wang Gui and others dared not speak first, but Sima Guang boldly wrote: "One who is adopted as an heir becomes the son of the adoptive father and cannot attend to his private kin. The Prince of Pu should be honored according to the precedents for enfeoffing and granting posthumous titles to relatives of the same generation, to be called 'Imperial Uncle,' with high offices and great states, bestowing the utmost honor." The assembly agreed. Wang Gui then ordered the clerks to draft the memorial based on Guang’s notes and submitted it, stating: "The former kings established rites with no dual supremacy. If reverence and love are divided between two, they cannot be whole in either. Thus, since the Qin and Han dynasties, when emperors ascended the throne from collateral lines and sought to honor their parents as emperors or empresses, they were criticized in their own time and ridiculed by later generations. Your ministers dare not take this as a model for our sagely dynasty. In past dynasties, succession often occurred after the late emperor’s passing, and the choice of heir sometimes came from the ministers, unlike Emperor Renzong, who, though not yet aged, deeply considered the weight of the ancestral temples and reverently followed the will of Heaven. From among the many imperial clansmen, he selected the most sagely and entrusted him with the great enterprise. Your Majesty first became the son of the late Emperor and then inherited the throne, thereby illuminating the realm. Though Pu Anyi, the Prince of Pu, shares with Your Majesty the bond of nature and the grace of nurture, it is by the virtue of the late Emperor that Your Majesty dons the imperial robes, possesses the Four Seas, and transmits the realm to sons and grandsons for ten thousand generations. Your ministers humbly propose that the Prince of Pu be honored according to the precedents of enfeoffment and posthumous titles for relatives of the same generation, with high offices and great states. The Ladies of Qiao, Xiang, and Xianyou should also be enfeoffed as grand ladies, aligning with ancient and modern propriety."

[Text missing] The memorial stated: "Wang Gui and others have not fully deliberated. What kinship should the Prince of Pu be called, and should his name be [missing] or not?" Since the Prince of Pu was Emperor Renzong’s elder brother, to the Emperor he should be called "Imperial Uncle" without naming him. The Participant in Determining Governmental Matters, Ouyang Xiu, cited *The Great Record of Mourning Attire*, arguing: "One who is adopted as an heir wears mourning for his parents for a reduced term of one year but does not erase their names, showing that while the mourning may be reduced, the name cannot be erased." If the birth parents are redesignated as "Imperial Uncle," there is no precedent in past dynasties. To enfeoff them with greater states would also violate the principle of not increasing ranks. He requested that the matter be referred to the Ministry of Rites for deliberation by the Three Departments and the Censorate. Subsequently, the Empress Dowager issued a handwritten edict, honoring the Prince of Pu as "Pu Anyi, the August Emperor," and the Ladies of Qiao, Xiang, and Xianyou as empresses.

The Record states: Meng Yizi once asked about filial piety, and Confucius told him not to violate the rites. Duke Wen of Teng asked about mourning, and Mencius told him to fully express his grief. The words of the sages and worthies arise from the human heart and are easily seen; they originate from the principles of Heaven and are easily understood. They do not employ overly discriminating language nor establish arguments that defy the world’s customs. Thus, those who hear them do not find them contentious or difficult to follow, and those who practice them do not feel obstructed or find them hard to accept. This is why their words are recorded in the classics and remain uncorrupted for ten thousand generations. As for the Pu Debate of the Song, which stirred contention in its time and brought calamity to later generations, it was truly because the various worthies’ arguments were too divisive, their corrections too extreme, and they could not emulate the sages’ magnanimity, breadth, and unobtrusive profundity.

From today’s perspective, the words of Sima Guang and Wang Gui were correct, yet the *Great Record of Mourning Attire*’s statement is not without basis, and not erasing the parents’ names is not without precedent. However, redesignation as "Imperial Uncle" lacks evidence and is untrustworthy, making it difficult to hastily adopt. The words of Ouyang Xiu and Han Qi were sound, yet the succession of emperors for ten thousand generations cannot be neglected, and the transmission of the imperial lineage for a hundred generations cannot be divided. That one who is adopted as an heir cannot attend to private kin is clearly trustworthy, and what is trustworthy is difficult to hastily change. This is right, that is wrong; this is permissible, that is not—thus, the crux lies in fully examining one’s heart. If Emperor Yingzong had reflected above on the unshakable foundation of Emperor Taizu, the direct transmission of the succession since Yao and Shun, and that what he once guarded was one person and one matter, while what he now presides over is the realm of ten thousand states and the Nine Provinces, he would have known that the Son of Heaven holds the greatest honor, and even if he wished to hesitate and attend to his private kin, he could not. If he had next considered that Emperor Renzong raised him from among the common people and placed him above the multitudes, that what he once followed was the daily care of warmth and attendance, while what he now serves are the suburban sacrifices and the altars of soil and grain, he would have known that his single person is the foundation of the myriad affairs, and even if he wished to deeply cherish the grace of nurture, he could not.

The Emperor’s fundamental heart remains unclear, and what he speaks is obstructed by impediments. You may believe that the late Emperor’s virtue was such that he first possessed the realm, while he may hold that the proper order of succession demands his rightful place. You may see high offices and grand ranks as the utmost in honor, while he may think that a father’s nobility through his son should follow the highest rites. Thus, the bond of natural kinship and the grace of nurturing require no words from others. Yet when it comes to the strategy of enthronement and the principle of dynastic succession, if moved by sentiment, there is more than enough; if contested in debate, there is never enough. In the end, the more one contends, the more one is confounded; the more one alters, the more one loses. Truly, this is an unparalleled principle of antiquity, an unresolved doubt, arising from the failure to follow the great sages and worthies in rectifying the hearts of men. And now, how could it be remedied?

When Emperor Xiaozong ascended the throne, he honored Emperor Gaozong as the Supreme Emperor and the Empress as the Supreme Empress, residing together in the Palace of Virtue and Longevity. One day, Emperor Xiaozong, dressed in his court robes and shoes, emerged from the Xiangxi Gate, braving the rain as he was supported by his attendants, and would not stop even at the palace gate. The Supreme Emperor repeatedly waved him off, then ordered his attendants to assist him in returning. Afterward, he turned to his ministers and said, “Now that I have entrusted the realm to the right person, I have no regrets.”

It is recorded: What is meant by “entrusting to the right person” is not merely the continuation of will and the completion of affairs, but the safeguarding of the ancestral temples and the altars of soil and grain above, and the land and the people below. Emperor Taizong of Tang said, “To avenge humiliation and repay the hundred kings, to eliminate evil and requite a thousand ages.” Such was the weight of the trust he bore. Emperor Xiaozong, indeed, was able to set his mind resolutely on restoration, relying on Zhang Jun as his great wall, assessing the enemy’s strength as unlike that of Qin Hui, boldly declaring the Jin to be without propriety and peace negotiations to be misguided—truly, he was the right person. Yet alas, the urgency of external crises was ever-present, and the resolve to taste gall to the end proved difficult. The defeat at Fuli was a setback from the start, and the treachery of those advocating retreat undermined him later. Though his heart was strong and determined, there was no effectual revival. Thus do the noble sigh at the rarity of success.

In the first month of the spring of the first year of the Longxing era, on the day *renchen* marking the new moon, the Emperor received court at the Hall of Literary Virtue, then proceeded to pay homage to the Supreme Emperor and the Supreme Empress at the Palace of Eternal Longevity. From this time onward, this became an annual custom.

In the seventh year of the Qiandao era, when the Supreme Emperor reached the age of seventy, the two august sovereigns were bestowed with honorific titles: *Guangyao Shousheng Xiantian Tidao Supreme Emperor* and *Shousheng Mingci Supreme Empress*. In the twelfth year of the Chunxi era, when the Supreme Emperor’s age increased to eighty, the honorific titles of the two sovereigns were further augmented: *Guangyao Shousheng Xiantian Tidao Xingren Chengde Jingwu Weifen Supreme Emperor* and *Shousheng Qiming Guangci Supreme Empress*. Grand celebratory rites were held, and a general amnesty was declared for the rest. Each year, the Emperor accompanied them to the Garden of Assembled Scenery, the Jade Ford Park, and the Temple of the Four Saints—visits too numerous to recount—exalting their veneration to the utmost.

Liu of Yongxin remarked: “In Emperor Xiaozong’s service to Emperor Gaozong, as recorded in the historical annals, both form and sentiment were fully realized, unwavering from beginning to end. Truly, his filial duty was without flaw. Some say that Xiaozong, having entered the imperial line as a collateral descendant, inherited from his predecessor an unparalleled legacy to be transmitted endlessly—how profound must his gratitude have been! Gratitude is what enabled his filial piety. He feared that his predecessor might regard him as distant and thus strove to uphold his legacy—this striving is what enabled his filial piety. Previously, Emperor Yingzong’s adoption as heir did not fully fulfill the Way, a failing lamented by the noble. Now, was there no lesson taken from this? Such reflection is what enabled his filial piety—not that his heart arose from mere spontaneity.”

Alas, what words are these? The noble judge a person by whether they attain to goodness alone. If one were to dismiss goodness because it arose from gratitude, would one then prefer those who act without gratitude and do no good? If one were to dismiss goodness because it arose from striving, would one then prefer those who act without striving and do no good? If one were to dismiss goodness because it arose from reflection, would one then prefer those who act without reflection and do no good? Such words would lead all under Heaven to abandon goodness.

It is recorded: Observing the two reigns of Gaozong and Xiaozong, the joy of heavenly bonds endured from beginning to end. From the Longxing era through Qiandao to Chunxi, spanning twenty-five years, it was not merely a matter of revering the revered and cherishing the cherished, of father and son fulfilling their roles, with one man’s compliance alone—rather, it won the hearts of all nations. One can imagine the splendor of their rituals and cultural refinements, the grace of their yielding and advancement—what must it have been like? Nor was it merely that one was Supreme Emperor and the other Son of Heaven, their dignity unmatched—rather, they attained longevity beyond eighty. One can imagine the venerable bearing of their aged visages and silvered hair, the solemnity of their yellowed robes and stooped frames—what must it have been like? Since the abdications of Yao, Shun, and Yu, has there truly been anyone like them?

Perhaps Gaozong’s abdication arose from perfect impartiality, a mind devoid of self, and thus Heaven’s recompense bestowed upon him the fullness of longevity and blessings. Xiaozong’s great virtue surpassed the ordinary by ten thousandfold, and thus the reverence accorded him was unparalleled. Yet the minds of common men, peering from afar, deem filial piety born of gratitude, of striving, or of reflection as either impractical or envious. Alas! Such views are the very source of the ceaseless calamities that later ages cannot escape.

When the Supreme Emperor passed away, the Emperor wept uncontrollably, beating his breast and stamping his feet for two days, refusing all sustenance. He said to Wang Huai and others: “In former times, Emperor Xiaowu of Jin and Emperor Xiaowen of Wei observed three years of mourning—why should attending to governance be an obstacle?” Huai replied: “Though Emperor Wu of Jin had such intentions, later the court reverted to wearing plain clothes and white hempen caps.” The Emperor said: “At the time, his ministers failed to comply. I shall set a new precedent—what harm is there?” Huai said: “When Your Majesty holds court, will it be proper for the Son of Heaven to wear mourning while the ministers wear ceremonial robes?” The Emperor said: “There are degrees of reduction.” He then withdrew.

An internal decree was issued: “As the late Supreme Emperor has departed, I shall wear mourning for three years, while the ministers shall follow the ordinance of one month.” The hundred officials submitted five memorials requesting that the Emperor return to the palace to attend to governance, but he refused. On the day *xinchou* of the second month, the *dan* sacrifice was performed, and the hundred officials doffed their mourning garb. The ministers submitted three memorials requesting that the Emperor hold court, but he refused.

On the day *wuxu* marking the new moon of the eleventh month, the Emperor visited the Palace of Eternal Longevity. From then on, he did so on every new moon and full moon. The Emperor began to conduct affairs of state in plain clothes at the Hall of Extended Harmony; when visiting the Palace of Eternal Longevity, he wore mourning attire and leaned on his staff as before.

In the spring of the fifteenth year, on the day *dingyou* of the first month, the Emperor visited the Palace of Eternal Longevity and performed rites before the spirit tablet. In the fourth month of summer, when Gaozong’s spirit tablet was enshrined in the Imperial Ancestral Temple, an edict was issued: “I recently decreed that I would wear mourning for three years, but the ministers repeatedly requested that I hold court and change my attire. Thus, I have attended to affairs in plain clothes within the inner palace. Though I have reluctantly complied with their requests, deferring to the ancestral temple, I have examined the classical rites and find my heart still unsettled. To observe the full mourning period would be closer to antiquity. Let all understand my utmost intent and make no further requests.”

Minister Liu Zheng remarked: "The three-year mourning period is a universal observance throughout the realm. Emperor Wen of Han first altered the ancient Way, and Emperor Jing failed to follow the classical rites, so later generations adhered to their precedent, and the mourning system fell into decay. Emperor Wu of Jin sought to express his personal grief, yet ultimately yielded to the arguments of Pei Xiu and Fu Xuan. Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei was able to restore the ancient system, yet still did not fully conform to the rites of *liangyin* and *emmi*. The rest are scarcely worth discussing. The theory of 'changing months' originated with Ying Shao, and vulgar scholars adopted it, until it was finally fixed as a twenty-seven-day observance. The rites of the former kings were thus largely destroyed. Even with sagacious rulers and wise ministers, they feared reform and perpetuated the old ways—how lamentable!

"Emperor Shouhuang’s filial devotion to his parents arose from his innate nature, and his reverence for the departed sprang from utmost sincerity. Though his sacred person had not yet reached the age of exemption from mourning, and his ministers repeatedly urged him to change his attire, his wise resolve was already set, and he remained unwavering. After the interment rites were completed, he withdrew to serve before the spirit tablet, wearing mourning garb for three full years to fulfill the mourning system. Since ancient times, he alone has done so.

"Recorded here: This reflects Emperor Xiaozong’s steadfast adherence to the great principle of legitimacy, for he did not allow even the slightest private affection for his kin to sway his resolve. Thus, the court historians praised him, declaring that his filial piety was beyond reproach.

"I have examined the records: In the thirteenth year of Shaoxing, when the Prince of Xiu passed away, the Emperor ordered him to resign his office and observe mourning—this was before his own accession. In the third year of Qiandao, when Lady Zhang, the Prince of Xiu’s wife, also passed away, he donned mourning in the Rear Garden—this was after his accession. Yet he never altered his title to that of an elder brother. As for Emperor Lizong, who posthumously honored his birth father, Xilu, as Prince Rong, and his mother, Lady Quan, as State Lady, and had his son, Yuran, inherit the title to perform sacrifices—he never bestowed imperial honors upon them. The *Pu Debate* of our dynasty was not even settled in its own time, let alone for later generations. Yet when scholars gathered to dispute, each claiming their own wisdom, it was far better that the great Dao be illuminated and human hearts return to uprightness. Let readers take note.

"*The History of the Yuan* records: At the beginning of the Zhiyuan era, Lian Xixian, serving as Grand Councilor of the Secretariat, observed mourning for his mother. He led his kinsmen in performing the ancient mourning rites, abstaining from even a drop of water for three days. His grief was so profound that he vomited blood and could not rise, dwelling in a thatched hut beside the grave. The chief ministers, citing the unsettled state of mourning regulations, wished to summon him back to office. They went together to his hut, but hearing his ceaseless wails of sorrow, they could not bring themselves to speak. Recorded here: This was the custom of the northern tribes. Even if the precedent of military exemption did not apply, and mourning regulations were not yet fixed, he wholeheartedly followed the ancient rites and devoted himself to completing the mourning period. For while human feelings may be overridden, the customs of the northern tribes cannot remain unchanged. If filial piety can move the spirits, how could it fail to move his colleagues? Yet those who, untrained in military affairs, willingly embraced the military exemption are no better than Lian Xixian’s detractors.

"In our dynasty, Hu Juren was filial from childhood. When his father fell ill, he tasted his stool to gauge its bitterness or sweetness. Though mourning rites had long been abandoned, he resolutely observed them. At first, he took neither water nor grain, and his weeping left him unconscious until he revived. Later, he became emaciated to the bone, unable to rise without a staff. For three years, he did not enter his bedchamber. The rites of interment, the ancestral hall, monthly offerings on the first day, and seasonal sacrifices—all followed the ancient rituals. Those who understood recognized his singular conduct, while those who did not often mocked him. Yet when the gentry learned of Master Hu’s true character, they began to esteem his intentions.

"Though in the privacy of his home, he and his wife treated each other as guests. He meticulously sorted even the smallest bamboo containers, maintaining strict distinctions that lasted a lifetime. He served his elder brother with fraternal devotion, and when relatives returned home, he would greet them at the gate. If they fell ill, he personally prepared their medicine. He cherished his clan, tirelessly instructing his sons and nephews. In receiving guests, he wore the *shenyi*, cap, and slippers, remaining dignified throughout the day. Though his nature was gentle and his conversation unassuming, people often delighted in his company.

"Recorded here: Master Zeng said, 'Sincerity within manifests itself without. Thus, the noble person is ever cautious in solitude.' Could one who, like Hu, maintained reverence within fail to be devoted to his kin? Those who claim to know the Master only now truly begin to understand him—though they grasp only the surface."

*Hongdao Record*, Volume 32, concludes.
*Hongdao Record*, Volume 33.

**On the Rites of Husband and Wife**

From the *Record of Rites*: The marriage rite (*hunli*) is for uniting the good of two clans, above to offer sacrifice to the ancestral temple, and below to continue posterity. Thus, the noble person holds it in reverence. For this reason, in the marriage rites—betrothal gifts (*nacai*), inquiry of names (*wenming*), auspicious announcement (*naji*), formal betrothal (*nazheng*), and request for the date (*qingqi*)—the host spreads mats and arranges tables in the ancestral temple, bows to welcome the guests outside the gate, enters with bows and yielding, and receives commands in the temple. This is how reverence, caution, gravity, and correctness are maintained in the marriage rite. Sharing a common platter to eat, exchanging nuptial cups, and partaking of the same wine serve to unite their bodies, equalize their status, and bind them in affection. Only after reverence, caution, gravity, and correctness are established is affection deepened. This is the essence of ritual, by which the distinction between male and female is made, and the righteousness of husband and wife is established.

At dawn, the bride rises early, bathes, and awaits. At daybreak, she is presented to her parents-in-law. The bride holds a basket of dates, dried meats, and dried fish as offerings. The parents-in-law offer her sweet wine, and she makes an offering of dried meats and wine. The offering of sweet wine completes the bride’s rite. When the parents-in-law enter the chamber, the bride presents a suckling pig, demonstrating her obedience. The next day, the parents-in-law feast the bride with a single libation to honor and reciprocate. The parents-in-law descend by the western steps, while the bride descends by the eastern steps, signifying the succession of generations. The completion of the bride’s rite and her obedience are thus affirmed. The emphasis on succession further underscores the importance of the bride’s obedience.

The bride’s obedience means submission to her parents-in-law, harmony with the household, and proper conduct toward her husband. She fulfills her duties in silk, hemp, cloth, and weaving, and carefully manages the household’s stores and provisions. Only when the bride’s obedience is complete can the inner household be harmonious and well-ordered. When the inner household is harmonious and well-ordered, the family can endure. Thus, the sage-kings held it in high regard.

**Recorded here:** The meaning of marriage is primary, for only with Heaven and Earth do the myriad things arise; only with the myriad things do male and female exist; only with male and female do husband and wife come to be; only with husband and wife do father and son emerge; and only then can ruler and minister, superior and inferior, and the principles of ritual and righteousness be established. Nothing precedes the Dao of husband and wife. Thus, it is said that the noble person holds it in reverence, and the sage-kings hold it in reverence. Yet its subtle words and profound meanings are tirelessly devoted to a single principle.

In all the rites—betrothal gifts, inquiry of names, auspicious announcement, formal betrothal, request for the date, and personal welcoming—there are horse attendants and assistants to ensure reverence, caution, gravity, and correctness, not stopping at a single act. Yet later generations neglect this, reducing it to a single libation, and even the personal welcoming is often omitted. This is to treat ancestors lightly before the union is formed and to slight the bride before the bond is made. It shows ignorance of the harmony of the times and disregard for the weight of a second union. This is most improper. Thus, this record preserves its meaning.

From the *Canon of Yao*: Yao bestowed his two daughters upon Yu of the Miao, making them consorts to Shun.

**Recorded here:** In the *Yijing*, the *Zhen* hexagram seeks once, and the *Li* hexagram seeks twice, each with one yang positioned between two yin. Yao intended for Shun to emerge from *Zhen* and succeed *Li*, so he gave him two wives. Later, the ritual for the Son of Heaven was established as nine consorts. Nine is a yang number. According to this principle, Yao’s bestowal of his daughters was also necessarily imbued with meaning.

From the *Yijing* (*Guimei* hexagram): When King Yi of the Shang gave his younger sister in marriage, the sleeves of the principal wife were not as fine as those of her younger sister.

**Recorded here:** King Yi rectified the rites of marriage and clarified the distinction between male and female, and nothing was more important than the differentiation between wife and concubine. Yet the sleeves of the principal wife were not as fine as those of her younger sister. This is because ritual takes substance as its foundation, and a wife’s virtue as her priority. Without virtue, one merely flaunts embroidered robes and pheasant plumes before others, while licentiousness and malice go unashamed. Thus, observing that the principal wife’s sleeves were not as fine as her sister’s reveals why the Shang Dao flourished. Observing the extravagance of favored concubines, who outshine others in attire, reveals why the customs of Yin led to its downfall. This is not the only instance.

Emperor Taizu of Song admonished Princess Yongning not to wear embroidered or kingfisher-feathered garments, yet later, Zhao Feiyan even gilded her shoes. How could such excesses endure?

From the *Major Odes* of the *Book of Songs*: "There is a maiden in a great state, a younger sister of Heaven. The auspicious omen was settled with betrothal gifts, and she was personally welcomed at the Wei River. A bridge of boats was made, and its splendor was resplendent."

**Recorded here:** Yao’s bestowal of his daughters and Shun’s acceptance of his charge were the auspicious settling of the mandate of Heaven. Thus, a bridge of boats was constructed, and a grand thoroughfare was made. From this, one sees the majesty and grandeur of the rituals of an entire era, which then became the rites of the Son of Heaven.

Later, the state of Lu upheld the Zhou rites, yet Duke Ai considered a single ceremonial cap a great matter while unaware of the splendor of a bridge of boats. He regarded a thousand chariots as honorable while unaware of the rarity of a maiden "a younger sister of Heaven." This is why Confucius responded with solemnity and why, in the end, there was no resplendent glory.

From the *Zhou Nan*:
"The creeping vines of *ge* stretch forth,
Extending through the central valley.
Their leaves grow lush and verdant,
While yellow birds take flight,
Alighting on the thickets,
Their calls ringing clear in harmony.

The creeping vines of *ge* stretch forth,
Extending through the central valley.
Their leaves grow dense and full,
Cut and boiled to make fine cloth,
Woven into garments,
Worn without excess.

She speaks to her tutor,
Announcing her return,
Washing her private garments,
Soaking her daily robes.
Whether washing or rinsing,
She goes home to visit her parents."

**Recorded here:** The so-called "younger sister of Heaven" was not revered merely for her lofty status or wealth, beyond reproach. Rather, it was because she, though rich, remained diligent; though noble, remained frugal; respected her elders without neglecting her tutors’ teachings; and, though married, did not diminish her filial devotion to her parents. Later generations of wives, if they abandon sericulture and weaving under the pretext of no public duties, differ from the woman of *"The creeping vines of ge stretch forth."* If they indulge in bronze tripods and jade, pearls and gold, they differ from the one who *"wore without excess."* If they lament, *"The lord feasts on delicacies while my heart grieves,"* they differ from the one who *"spoke to her tutor."* If, like the wife of Qi, they return home with a retinue like clouds, they differ from the one who *"went home to visit her parents."*

When the royal daughter of King Wen was married to a feudal lord, her carriage and robes were splendid, yet she dared not flaunt her nobility to lord over her husband’s house. Thus, the poet praised her, saying:
*"How lush they bloom!
Like the blossoms of the *tangdi* tree—
Why are they not solemn and refined?
The carriage of the royal daughter!"*

*"How lush they bloom!
Fair as peach and plum—
Grandson of King Ping,
Daughter of the Marquis of Qi."*

**Recorded here:** That a feudal lord’s daughter was escorted by a hundred chariots was no exaggeration, for it revealed the effects of King Wen’s self-cultivation and family governance. That the carriage of the royal daughter was described as *"Why are they not solemn and refined?"* was no mere praise, but a testament to the transformative influence of King Wen and Tai Si’s inner governance. Those who, though wearing ceremonial caps and conducting the bride’s welcome, cannot show reverence in their bearing do so out of arrogance. Those who, though entrusted with the succession of a dynasty, cannot harmonize in their conduct do so out of perversity. In the Way of marriage, none prosper who cling to arrogance, and none find fortune who harbor perversity.

She, endowed with the virtue of the yielding and compliant *yin*, seated in the loftiest of positions, yet humbled herself in self-restraint—this is what is meant by *"solemn and refined."* The younger sister, though blessed with youthful beauty, submitted to her elder husband and moved him with her grace—this is what is meant by *"harmonious."* Thus, the grandson of King Ping and the daughter of the Marquis of Qi are still admired to this day without end.

The feudal lords of the southern lands, transformed by King Wen’s teachings, rectified their hearts and cultivated their persons to govern their households. Their women, likewise transformed by the queen’s example, possessed the virtues of serenity, purity, and singular devotion. Thus, when they married into the houses of feudal lords, their families praised them, saying:
*"The magpie has a nest,
The turtledove dwells in it.
This maiden goes to her home,
A hundred chariots escort her."*

*"The magpie has a nest,
The turtledove occupies it.
This maiden goes to her home,
A hundred chariots attend her."*

*"The magpie has a nest,
The turtledove fills it.
This maiden goes to her home,
A hundred chariots complete her procession."*

**Recorded here:** When a feudal lord’s daughter marries another feudal lord, the escort of a hundred chariots signifies the role of the wife, the duties of the lady of the state—above, she continues the lineage of her ancestors; in rank, she stands as an equal to the feudal lord. Only when the rites of marriage are complete does the chaste maiden arrive, and the governance of the inner palace is established. The *Shao Nan* begins with *"The Magpie’s Nest"* to emphasize that the lord’s wife is one whom the people look up to and must not be remiss. Such vigilance is like the pheasant-feathered curtains of the court. Even the Lady Zhuang Jiang of Wei, though unappreciated, was likened to *"the great carriage rumbling on"*—how far removed is this from the ethos of *"The Magpie’s Nest"*? And the royal minister who dared not elope—how distant is he from its spirit?

After the Marquis of Han paid homage at court and returned, he proceeded with the bride’s welcome. The *Odes* say:
*"The Marquis of Han took a wife,
A niece of the King of Fen,
A daughter of Juefu—
The Marquis of Han went to meet her.
At Jue’s village,
A hundred chariots thundered,
Eight bells chimed in harmony,
Resplendent was their glory.
Her sisters followed,
A throng like clouds.
The Marquis of Han gazed upon them,
His gates ablaze with splendor."*

It is recorded: In my humble observation, the rite of the bridegroom’s personal welcome was first corrupted in Qi and Lu, not that the rest of the world failed to follow it. Han, too, was a feudal lord, yet he conducted himself with such meticulous adherence to ritual propriety—whereupon the noble man declared: “This is still akin to antiquity.” Beyond this, one awaits the bride at the threshold, adorns the ears with white silk. How much of this remains but a vestige of Qi’s hegemonic customs and the remnants of its policies? Lu, a state that upheld ritual and righteousness, permitted the bride’s family to come and escort her—whether they did so properly or not is not for Ji to reproach, but for us to decline with justification. That a descendant of the Duke of Zhou should fall short of the daughter of Juefu—this is what the Master deeply lamented. Hence it is said: When the *Odes* perished, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* arose.

From the *Lesser Elegantiae*:
*"The rumbling of the carriage’s coupling,
Longing for the maiden’s departure—
Not for hunger, not for thirst,
But for virtue’s resonance to gather."*
Though without close companions,
One feasts and rejoices;
Leaning upon that level grove,
Where turtledoves alight—
That noble maiden of stately form.
Let virtuous teachings come,
Feast and acclaim,
Cherish her without surfeit.
Though no fine wine is poured,
Drink in hope;
Though no choice viands are served,
Eat in hope.
Though no virtue is bestowed upon you,
Sing and dance—
Ascend that lofty ridge,
Split the oak for kindling.
Split the oak for kindling,
Its leaves so lush.
How rare to behold you,
My heart is poured out.
Lofty mountains to gaze upon,
Radiant paths to tread.
Four steeds prance,
Six reins harmonize like zither strings.
Beholding your new union,
My heart is consoled.

It is recorded: The *Xian* hexagram’s image states: “Above the mountain is the marsh—*Xian*. The noble man, with emptiness, receives others.” The reason the sage values the mutual resonance of man and woman is fundamentally to bring virtuous teachings. Yet the world indulges in chasing beauty, indulges in prolonging countenance—like the ephemeral *shun* blossom, it is desired; like winter provisions, it is discarded. Thus, how fleeting is the resonance of virtue! Green silk, fine threads—then they are tended; dignified and composed demeanor—then it is neglected. Therefore, I long for the ancients—were they ever thus?

The sage applied the *Guan Ju* to one household, extended the *Peach Blossom* to one state, and disseminated the *Carriage’s Coupling* throughout the world, making known the way of righteousness. Unions are perfected only through virtue, and the lofty mountains and radiant paths suffice to permeate high and low. No ruler governing a state fails to seek worthies to assist him, just as no Daoist fails to seek friends to cultivate benevolence. This is the utmost benefit of mountains and marshes, the grand thoroughfare of harmonious resonance, the subtle intent of empty receptivity, the noble heart of radiant paths. Who would claim that the joy of new marriage exists merely for song, dance, and frivolity?

From the *Jiao Te Sheng*:
The groom personally welcomes the bride, the man preceding the woman—this is the principle of firmness and yielding. Heaven precedes earth, the ruler precedes the minister—this principle is one and the same. Holding the ritual tablet to meet, reverence is manifest in distinction. When men and women are distinct, then father and son are close. When father and son are close, then righteousness arises. When righteousness arises, then ritual is established. When ritual is established, then all things are at peace. Without distinction, without righteousness, it is the way of beasts.

The groom personally hands the reins to assist her descent, showing affection. Exiting through the main gate, he leads first—the man guides the woman, the woman follows the man—thus begins the righteousness of husband and wife. A woman follows others: in youth, she follows her father and brothers; when married, she follows her husband; when widowed, she follows her son. The husband is one who, with wisdom, guides others. Thus, a woman has no rank; she follows her husband’s rank, sits according to his seniority, and uses vessels of clay and gourd—this is the exaltation of ritual.

The next morning, the bride washes and spins; when the parents-in-law finish eating, the bride partakes of the leftovers—this is a private gesture. The parents-in-law descend by the western steps, the bride by the eastern steps—this is to receive her in the chamber. Wedding rites do not employ music, for they embody the principle of hidden yin. Music pertains to yang qi. Wedding rites are not congratulated, for they pertain to the proper order of humanity.

It is recorded: The *Te Sheng* sacrifice concludes with this: Heaven and earth are distinct, firmness and yielding intermingle; when men and women are disordered, beasts arise. Thus, there are women who bewitch men, as in the poems of Zheng; thus, there is no distinction, as in the customs of *Ju Di*; thus, there is no personal welcome, as in the conduct of *Zhong Feng*; thus, there is no following the man, as in the reins of the male fox; thus, there is private departure from the domain, as in the satire of *Fan Fu*; thus, there is wisdom that fails to guide, as in the demise in the carriage; thus, there is self-aggrandizement, as in the usurpation of imperial prerogative; thus, there is no personal spinning, as in the relocation to the western palace—all are grave violations of ritual.

From the *Zuozhuan*: In the fifth year of Duke Yin, the ninth month, the palace of Zhong Zi was inspected, and the *Wan* dance was to be performed. The Duke inquired about the number of feathered banners from Zhong Zhong, who replied: “The Son of Heaven uses eight, feudal lords six, grandees four, and officers two.” Dance regulates the eight sounds and propagates the eight winds, hence the Duke followed the number below eight. Thus, six feathered banners were first offered, beginning the use of the six-row formation.

It is recorded: Lü of Shu Lei stated: King Cheng bestowed the rites and music of the Son of Heaven upon the Duke of Zhou. Even in the time of Duke Yin, after centuries, none questioned this—why did Zhong Zhong not don armor and remonstrate, so that the world might once again witness the rites and music of the Duke of Zhou, and Lu thus establish his legacy? If so, was it true? I say: No. Ritual does not tolerate reckless discourse, nor do people shirk expense. Thus, the distinction between heaven’s crown and earth’s footwear, the precedence of ritual over music—these are unalterably fixed. That Yin, as an elder half-brother, served the ancestral temple, and that the temple of Duke Hui was paired with Meng Zi—this was ritual. Yet to indulge the whims of a dog-keeper, to exalt the office of a concubine—this is to place the cap and shoes amiss. This is what is meant by reckless discourse. For Zhong Zhong, it would have been proper to remonstrate by clarifying the order of concubines and half-brothers, the impropriety of dual origins and paired heirs, first rectifying names and ensuring proper discourse—only then could ritual and music flourish.

Now, the views of the dog-keeper and the enumeration of plumes and feathers—here, precedence is thrown into disorder. This is what is meant by shirking expense. Even if such feathers were offered in the ancestral temples, they would already disrupt the institutions of the Duke of Zhou, offering no remedy to the root of chaos and collapse—how much less could one demand redress for its peripheral abuses? When assessing total merit while inquiring into seniority, neither ruler nor minister, superior nor subordinate, knows what truly matters. Is it any wonder that slander goes unseen and disorder remains unrecognized?

When Ji Wenzi journeyed to Song to escort a bride, upon his return, the Duke feasted him and recited the fifth stanza of *"Han Yi."* Mu Jiang emerged from her chamber, bowed twice, and said: "The great officer has labored humbly, not forgetting the former lord, extending his grace to the successor, and even to this unworthy widow. The former lord would still hold hope." She dared to bow in gratitude for the great officer’s weighty toil. Then she recited the final stanza of *"Lü Yi"* before retiring.

Hu’s commentary on the fields states: Bo Ji was renowned for her filial piety and virtue within the household, hence the escort of the bride. The Duke sent a minister to particularly enrich her dowry, a ritual honoring worthiness that spread her reputation afar. Thus, the states vied in admiration, trusting in her freedom from the jealousies of women. Cheng’s commentary says: If the virtue of a single woman is heard among the feudal lords, how much more so for a gentleman? Both commentaries miss the essence of the classic.

Recorded here: Mu Jiang escorted a bride to Song, then entered and recited *"Lü Yi"*—how virtuous she seemed! Yet later, in her licentiousness with Xuan Bo, she cast milfoil stalks and received the hexagram *Sui*—how depraved she became! The *Odes* say: "Let there be no impropriety, no reproach." Yet with [lacuna] she labored to honor the great officer’s humility—this was indeed improper and reproachable. The *Documents* say: "Only when the house is in ruins..." When a lord feasts a minister while the mother emerges from her chamber, the hen crows at dawn. From this arose the coercion of the ruined state and the calamity of the usurped office—all originating here. Thus, it was not for the worthiness of Bo Ji, but to admonish the famine and disorder of Lu. The intent of the sage runs deep indeed.

The *Biographies of Exemplary Women* states: Bo Ji married Duke Gong of Song. When the Duke died, Bo Ji was widowed. By the time of Duke Jing, fire broke out in Bo Ji’s palace at night. Her attendants said: "My lady, briefly withdraw from the fire." Bo Ji replied: "According to a woman’s ritual, if both governess and tutor are not present, one does not descend from the hall at night. I await their arrival." The governess arrived, but the tutor had not yet come. The attendants again urged: "My lady, briefly withdraw from the fire." Bo Ji said: "A woman’s ritual dictates that if the tutor does not arrive, one may not descend from the hall at night. To seek life by transgressing propriety is not as good as upholding ritual unto death." She was thus overtaken by the fire and perished.

Recorded here: The lady’s refusal to act without her tutor—was this truly so? When Duke Gong died, the lady was not yet a widow. To sever her nose—this was not the proper way to hang oneself in the central chamber, for it would defile the ditches and streams. If the tutor had not arrived, she could have declined on ritual grounds. What regret would there be in death? What regret, indeed?

Meng Ji was the eldest daughter of the Hua clan and the wife of Duke Xiao of Qi. She loved ritual and was steadfast in her integrity. Once, when the Duke traveled to Langye, Meng Ji accompanied him. As they journeyed, the horses bolted and the carriage shattered. Duke Xiao ordered a four-horse standing chariot to carry her, but Meng Ji instructed the driver to lower the curtains for her concealment and had her governess respond: "I have heard that when consorts and queens travel, they must ride in a secure carriage with covered wheels; when descending from the hall, they must be attended by their governesses and tutors; in advancing or retreating, they must ensure the jade pendants of their girdles chime and their sashes are properly fastened; and when dwelling in the wilds, they must be shielded by curtains and screens—all to rectify the heart, unify the will, and restrain oneself. Now, this standing chariot lacks a canopy, and I dare not accept such an order. To dwell in the wilds without protection is not a place where I dare linger. Both violate ritual profoundly. To live without ritual is not as good as dying early." The messenger hastened to report this, and the Duke then provided a proper carriage before she would ride and return.

Recorded here: Meng Ji may indeed be called one who understood ritual. Ritual must not be departed from even for a moment. Thus, when a woman leaves her home, she veils her face—how could she accept being carried in a standing chariot? Yet, when Duke Xiao journeyed to Langye, his wife accompanied him—was this to inspect the spring plowing or the summer harvest? Or was it to indulge in hunting and revelry, abandoning himself to wine? Had Meng Ji truly considered this, she would not have waited for the horses to bolt and the carriage to shatter in the wilds before leisurely fulfilling her duties within the inner chambers.

Qi had the wife of Qi Liang Zhi. When Duke Zhuang attacked Ju, Qi Liang Zhi died in battle. As Duke Zhuang passed by on his return, the wife sent a messenger to offer condolences along the road. She said: "If my husband had committed a crime, why would Your Lordship deign to send such a message? If he died blameless, then my humble self has the dilapidated ancestral home in the lower quarters, and I cannot receive your condolences at the outskirts." Thereupon, Duke Zhuang turned back, went to her home, and performed the rites before departing. The wife had no children, and neither within nor without did she have relatives of the five degrees of kinship. She laid her husband’s corpse beneath the city wall and wept, her inner sincerity moving all who heard. Travelers passing by could not help but shed tears, and for ten days, the city walls collapsed. After the burial, she said: "Where shall I return? When my father lived, I relied on him; when my husband lived, I relied on him; when my son lived, I relied on him. Now, above, I have no father; in the middle, I have no husband; below, I have no son—whom shall I depend upon?" She then threw herself into the Zi River and died.

The gentleman says: The wife of Qi Liang Zhi was chaste and understood ritual.

Recorded here: The wife of Qi Liang was not to be compared with Meng Ji of the Hua clan. For a man to go forth on service is righteous; to wander for pleasure is not. Thus, the bearing of shields in *Bo Xi* and the parting gifts in *Xiong Zhi* are not actions a woman should undertake. That the city walls collapsed was no marvel, nor was the transformation of customs extraordinary—both were stirred by her inner sincerity. Alas! To conduct oneself with composure and uphold ritual, never daring to act on one’s own—this is called being chaste and ritually correct. Truly, is it not so?

In the *Guo Yu*, when the mother of Gongfu Wenbo wished to arrange his marriage, she feasted the elders of his clan and recited the three stanzas of *Lü Yi*. The elders requested to divine the match by tortoise shell. Master Hai heard of this and said: "Well done! When men and women feast, they should not involve the elders of the clan. In matters concerning the clan, one should consult only the clan members."

To scheme yet not transgress, to be subtle yet luminous—such is the way. Poetry serves to unite intentions, song to chant the verses. Now, poetry is used to unite the household, song to chant it—this accords with the law.

It is recorded: Can the feasts of Jing Jiang and Mu Jiang truly be spoken of in the same breath? The union of partners marks the beginning of the people’s life; to honor the ancestral temples and consult the clan elders is how the bond between two families is forged. The *Book of Changes* says: "To be vigilant in one’s household—regret vanishes." This surely speaks of Jing Jiang.

Thus, to keep one’s words from straying to the outer court is wisdom; to entrust the door’s lock to the tortoise-shell divination is trust; to exclude clan ministers from the feast is ritual propriety; to labor without forgetting one’s duties is righteousness; to speak without forgetting one’s parents-in-law is benevolence. When it is said, "To scheme yet not transgress," and "To accord with the law"—how deeply the noble one approves!

In the *Rites and Their Commentaries*, the Lu master Chun Jiang said: "A woman’s duty is to be compliant and obedient, with chastity and reverence as her foremost virtues. Thus, in serving her husband, there are five observances: At dawn, she rises and attends to her toilet, then presents herself in audience—this embodies the solemnity of ruler and minister. In washing hands and partaking of the morning meal, she maintains the reverence of father and child..."

Returning home to fulfill her duties, she embodies the bond of siblings; in receiving appointments with utmost sincerity, she upholds the trust of friends; and only after the intimacy of the bedchamber does the relationship between husband and wife take form.

Lady Zong of Song was the wife of Bao Su. After Su had served in Wei for three years, he took an outside wife. Her sister-in-law said to her, "You may leave him now." Lady Zong asked, "For what reason?" The sister-in-law replied, "Since the lady has taken a new favor, why do you remain?" Lady Zong said, "A woman’s chastity lies in unwavering devotion, and her compliance in following what is good—how could monopolizing her husband’s love be considered virtuous? By ritual, the Son of Heaven has twelve consorts, the feudal lords nine, high ministers and great officers three, and scholars two. My husband is a scholar, so is it not fitting that he has two wives? Moreover, a wife may be sent away for seven reasons, with usurping the proper order foremost among them. My sister-in-law does not instruct me in the rites of household conduct but instead urges me to act in a way that would lead to my dismissal—how could this be right?" She refused to heed the advice. When the Duke of Song heard of this, he honored her dwelling, naming it "Model of Ritual." It is recorded: Lu and Song were states renowned for ritual and propriety. Thus, whether as a teacher or a model, they truly set the standard for inner chambers and official quarters, becoming the exemplar for later generations in matters of ritual instruction. This is worth recording.

The *Elementary Learning* states: When Wei Jiang passed through Ji, he saw Ji Que weeding, his wife bringing him food. They treated each other with the reverence due to guests. Returning home, Wei Jiang spoke of this to Duke Wen, saying, "This is the gathering of reverent virtue. One who is reverent must possess virtue, and virtue is what governs the people." The Duke was urged to employ him. "I have heard that when one goes out, one should conduct oneself as if in the presence of honored guests, and when serving others, as if performing a sacrifice—this is the principle of benevolence." Duke Wen appointed him as a great officer of the Lower Army.

Lord Pang never entered the city or court. He and his wife treated each other with the respect due to guests. Liu Biao visited him and found Lord Pang resting from plowing on a ridge, while his wife and children weeded before him. Pointing, Biao asked, "Sir, you toil in the fields and refuse official salary—how then do you intend to provide for your descendants?" Lord Pang replied, "The world leaves its descendants peril, while I alone leave them peace. Though what we leave differs, neither of us fails to leave something." Biao sighed and departed.

It is recorded: In the weeding of Ji Que and the plowing of Lord Pang, is there truly a difference? Ji Que was one who bent his name, while Lord Pang was one who bent his person. One who bends his person retreats without ceasing; one who bends his name may advance and extend himself. This is where they differ. Who has not heard of Lü Sheng’s crisis? Yet it was not widely emulated. The matter of the shot hook, however, became a model. When Ji made a single remark, he received the highest reward; when Que served the Three Jin, he was appointed to the rank of chief minister. Duke Wen’s judgment was indeed precise.

The *Book of Han* records: Emperor Wen’s favored consort, Lady Shen, once sat on the same mat as the Empress within the palace. When the Emperor visited the Shanglin Park, the Empress and Lady Shen accompanied him. The chamberlain laid out a mat, but Yuan Ang drew it back, preventing Lady Shen from sitting. Enraged, she refused to sit, and the Emperor, also angered, rose. Ang then stepped forward and explained, "I have heard that when there is proper order between high and low, there is harmony above and below. Now that the Empress has been established, Lady Shen is but a concubine—how can she share the same seat? Does Your Majesty not see the greed of others?" The Emperor was pleased, summoned Lady Shen to speak with her, and bestowed upon Ang fifty catties of gold.

It is recorded: Observing the early years of the Han, one sees that not only in the court and among ruler and ministers, but even within the inner palace, there were many instances of such coarseness. Later generations would see nothing like it.

During the Eastern Han, Empress Deng of Emperor He entered the palace as a Noble Lady at the age of sixteen. She was reverent, cautious, and meticulous, conducting herself with strict adherence to ritual. She served Empress Yin day and night with diligence, treating her fellow consorts with humility, always putting herself below them. Even the palace servants and attendants received her kindness and compassion. At gatherings, while the other consorts and noble ladies vied in lavish delicacies, adorned with gleaming hairpins and radiant garments, Empress Deng alone favored plainness. Her attire was simple, without ornament, and she deeply restrained herself. If her clothing’s color matched that of Empress Yin, she would immediately change it. When they appeared together, she dared not sit upright but stood aside, making herself small. Whenever the Emperor asked her a question, she would first glance at the Empress before answering, never daring to speak before her. The Emperor, knowing the Empress labored with such care, sighed and said, "The toil of cultivating virtue is truly like this."

It is recorded: From this, one sees that not only were there no incidents like that of Lady Shen, but the frugal and virtuous example of Empress Ma would come to prevail throughout the court.

Ban Zhao, wife of Cao Shishu, was known as the Great Lady. She was broadly learned and highly talented, her conduct always proper, her moral integrity and adherence to ritual complete. She composed the *Lessons for Women* in seven chapters: "Humility" first, "Husband and Wife" second, "Reverence and Caution" third, "Wifely Conduct" fourth, "Wholehearted Devotion" fifth, "Compliance" sixth, and "Harmony with Sisters-in-Law" seventh. In summary, it states: In ancient times, when a girl was born, after three days she was placed beneath the bed and given a tile to play with, while an offering was made. Placing her outside, beneath the bed, made clear her humble and submissive nature, that she was to serve others...

Giving her a tile to play with made clear her practice of labor and devotion to diligent work; making an offering to the ancestral lord made clear her duty to preside over sacrifices. These three are the constant Dao of womanhood.

The canons of ritual and law teach humility, deference, and reverence—placing others before oneself. One should not boast of good deeds nor deny faults; endure humiliation and bear disgrace, ever as though in awe. Rise early and retire late, never shirking day or night. Attend to private duties without shunning difficulty or ease; whatever is undertaken must be completed, with hands ever diligent in order. Maintain a proper demeanor and upright conduct to serve one’s husband.

If these are fully observed, yet one still suffers from obscurity or faces disgrace, such has never been known. The Dao of husband and wife is to match yin and yang, to commune with the numinous, embodying the great principle of Heaven and Earth and the cardinal bonds of human relations. If the husband is not virtuous, he cannot govern his wife; if the wife is not virtuous, she cannot serve her husband. Yin and yang differ in nature, as do the conduct of men and women. Yang’s virtue lies in strength, yin’s function in softness. For men, vigor is prized; for women, gentleness is beauty.

In cultivating oneself, nothing surpasses reverence; in avoiding conflict, nothing surpasses compliance. Thus it is said: the Dao of reverence and compliance is the great ritual of the wife. If a wife is disrespectful and unrestrained, she invites reprimand; if her anger persists, she invites the rod. The bond of husband and wife is rooted in righteousness for harmonious kinship and in affection for mutual love. Once the rod is wielded, what righteousness remains? Once reprimands are uttered, what affection endures? When both affection and righteousness are forsaken, husband and wife part ways.

A woman has four virtues: wifely virtue, wifely speech, wifely bearing, and wifely work. Wifely virtue need not be of extraordinary talent or wisdom; wifely speech need not be eloquent or sharp-tongued; wifely bearing need not be of dazzling beauty; wifely work need not surpass others in skill. To be pure, serene, and steadfast, to uphold integrity and order, to conduct oneself with shame, and to act with propriety—this is wifely virtue. To choose words carefully, avoid harsh speech, speak only when appropriate, and never weary others—this is wifely speech. To wash away dust and filth, keep clothing and food fresh and clean, bathe at proper times, and keep the body free from defilement—this is wifely bearing. To devote oneself to spinning and weaving, avoid frivolous laughter, prepare wine and food for sacrifices, and serve guests—this is wifely work. These four are the great virtues of womanhood and must not be lacking. Yet they are easily practiced—only the will to uphold them is required.

If one’s conduct offends the gods, Heaven punishes; if one strays from ritual and propriety, one’s husband scorns. Thus the *Women’s Precepts* states: Winning one’s husband’s heart is eternal fulfillment; losing it is eternal ruin. From this it follows that a wife must seek her husband’s heart. Yet what she seeks is not flattery or improper intimacy. Rather, nothing surpasses wholehearted sincerity, proper demeanor, and adherence to ritual and duty. Let her ears hear no improper speech, her eyes see no indecency; let her go out without adornment and return without neglecting her duties. Let her not gather with crowds or gaze idly at the gates—this is wholehearted sincerity and proper demeanor.

If, however, she is frivolous in movement, careless in gaze and hearing, disheveled indoors and coquettish outdoors, speaking of what she ought not and gazing at what she ought not—this is failure to uphold wholehearted sincerity and proper demeanor.

It is recorded: The words of ritual expound the great principle of yin and yang, hardness and softness; the words of the *Lessons for Women* detail the intricacies of conduct within and without the household. Thus I have recorded them in full, to instruct those within the inner chambers who would know ritual.

Some say: In Ban Zhao’s time, power lay with the empress. The *Lessons for Women* could not rectify this, and she even engaged in external affairs—how does this accord with the Dao of reverence and caution, or the virtue of wifely compliance? Yet I have often observed the *Book of Changes*: The *Hexagram of Small Excess* states: "Smooth progress, favorable for constancy. Suitable for small matters, not for great affairs. It is not fitting to ascend; it is fitting to descend. Great good fortune." This is its meaning.

Thus, when a minister usurps the king’s authority, he is punished, for hardness has lost its proper place. When a concubine or wife seizes the moment, she is praised, for softness has found its proper place. First suffering obscurity and hardship, then attaining prominence—this is the smooth progress of *Small Excess*. Following the completion of the *Hexagram of the Gentle*, it is favorable for constancy. Composing seven chapters of instruction to aid and encourage women is not fitting for those above but fitting for those below. Yet only when the empress, like the sixth line of the hexagram, assumes control can great goodness be realized—is this not what is meant by "great good fortune"? The words of the many traditions seem to have been spoken with purpose. Let the reader consider them carefully.

Liang Hong, styled Boluan, was poor in family but noble in integrity, mastering all worthy teachings without exception. The villagers admired his loftiness and many sought to marry their daughters to him, yet Hong steadfastly refused. In the same county lived a woman of the Meng clan, stout and plain in appearance, who declined all offers of marriage. When her parents asked her reason, she replied, “I wish to wed one as worthy as Liang Boluan.” Hong, hearing of this, sent a betrothal gift. The woman requested hempen cloth for clothing, sandals of woven hemp, and tools for basketry and sewing. Upon marriage, she prepared the wedding feast and, entering his home, waited seven days before performing the rites of a wife.

The record states: Master Gui once served as tutor to Prince Tai of Wei. The Emperor said, “Serve Gui as you would serve me.” If the prince could be granted rank, how could the sovereign alone be exempt from proper observance? Though Gui failed to correct Prince Tai’s faults, he succeeded in perfecting the sovereign’s virtue—how different from the conduct of Fang and Du in their time.

In the sixth year of Jianzhong during the reign of Dezong, the ritual for princesses paying respects to their parents-in-law was first established. Previously, when a princess married, her parents-in-law would bow to her, while she made no return. The Emperor ordered the Ministry of Rites to determine the proper ceremony: the parents-in-law would sit to receive her in the central hall, while uncles, brothers, and sisters-in-law stood to receive her in the eastern chamber, following the rites of common households.

The record states: Since the Southern Peace princesses married, their customs had already diverged from those of former dynasties. Yet over time, old ways were lost, and世俗 clung to inherited practices, making sudden change difficult. Now that the ritual has been set, it may be called good.

The Tang court, generation after generation, indulged in favoritism toward women, inviting strange misfortunes. Though the realm enjoyed peace and prosperity, the same errors repeated, leading many to marry late. Some wed with gray hair, yet even then, how could they avoid observing proper rites? Emperor Dezong once rebuked his officials, saying, “You value frugality; I value ritual.” Yet when Princess Tang’an passed, he blamed his ministers, claiming their expenses had exceeded his own. How inconsistent his pursuit of reputation—first one way, then another! Was it that when he established the rites, the state faced many troubles, but when building pagodas, extravagance reemerged? His love of ritual was not steadfast, and for good reason.

According to *The History of the Song*: Empress Meng of Emperor Zhezong was the granddaughter of Meng Yuan, Defender-in-Chief of Meizhou and posthumously enfeoffed as Grand Preceptor, and the daughter of Meng Zaizhi, Gatekeeper of the Palace. In the seventh year of Yuanyou, Empress Dowager Xuanren addressed the chief ministers: “Meng’s daughter is sixteen, well-taught in feminine virtue, and capable of observing the rites of a wife. She is fit to be established as empress.” Considering the recent simplification of court rituals, she ordered the Hanlin Academy, the Censorate, the Remonstrance Bureau, the Secretariat, and the Ministry of Rites to deliberate and present the six rites for the empress’s investiture.

Thereupon, the Emperor appointed:
- Left Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs Lü Dafang as Acting Grand Commandant and Chief Envoy for the Welcoming Ceremony;
- Vice Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs Han Shiyan as Acting Grand Tutor and Deputy;
- Left Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs Su Song as Acting Grand Commandant and Chief Envoy for the Presentation of the Edict;
- Participant in the Bureau of Military Affairs Wang Yansou as Acting Grand Tutor and Deputy;

The Emperor personally ascended the Hall of Literary Virtue to invest her as empress. The Empress Dowager later told the Emperor, “To gain a worthy inner helper is no small matter.” She promoted the empress’s father to Commander of the Guard of Honor and Prefect of Rongzhou, and her mother, née Wang, was enfeoffed as Lady of Huayuan Commandery.

The record states: In this era of the Song, rituals surpassed those of all former dynasties, exceeding even the Tang and Han. Through the virtuous conduct of a refined woman, the court established its rightful lineage. Above, she was guided by a mother and sovereign of the highest cultivation; below, she was assisted by a multitude of great ministers. How solemnly the six rites were observed! Yet before long, a petty official’s slander sundered them. When Zhang Dun plotted against her and Hao Sui fermented disaster, though the Emperor knew her virtue had been maligned, he remained deluded. Was it that he once valued inner helpers but later exalted external treachery, ever opposing the empress? Or was it that calamity loomed, and he became so disordered he knew not his own mind? King You deposed Queen Shen and brought the Rong to attack Zhou; King Xiang deposed Queen Di and brought ruin upon Zheng. From ancient times, such mirrors abound—let the noble man observe them. If the beginning was marked by meticulous ritual, how could the middle lack benevolence? And if the middle lacked benevolence, how could the end escape disaster? Success and failure truly cannot be used to judge a person.

Princess Jingguo, the eldest princess, disliked frivolous play from childhood. Emperor Taizong once opened the imperial treasury and allowed his daughters to choose treasures to observe their inclinations. The princess alone took nothing. When Emperor Zhenzong ascended the throne, she married the Attached Attendant and Commandant-escort Li Zunxu. By old custom, when a princess married, her father was demoted to the status of a brother. At the time, Zunxu’s father, Jichang, was still living. The princess, on his birthday, paid her respects to him as an uncle. The Emperor, hearing of this, secretly sent her ceremonial robes, a jeweled belt, vessels, and silks to aid in offering birthday felicitations. Whenever Zunxu feasted with guests—all of them worthy gentlemen—the princess personally oversaw the preparation of the feast. When Zunxu was appointed Prefect of Xuzhou and suddenly fell ill, the princess hastened to visit him. Her attendants reminded her that she should first memorialize the throne, but she did not wait for a reply and departed, accompanied by only five or six attendants. The Emperor, learning of this, swiftly ordered eunuchs to command the local garrisons to escort her. After her husband’s death, she wore mourning garments without respite. Even after the mourning period ended, she refused to wear fine or ornate clothing. Once, while feasting in the palace, the Emperor personally adorned her with flowers, but she declined, saying, “I have vowed never to do so again.”

The record states: According to the house laws of the Song, Emperor Renzong treated his aunt as a mother. How could the princess alone fail to serve her father-in-law as a wife serves her father?

Thus, the Jinguo Princess’s adherence to ritual propriety was indeed preceded by the Emperor’s own example. The practice of demoting parents-in-law to the status of siblings was unheard of before the Three Dynasties; it depends entirely on how the wife conducts herself. Those who observe this must not remain ignorant of it.

From the *Collected Works of Yichuan*: The late father of the Two Chengs, Cheng Xiang, and his mother, Lady Hou, served her parents-in-law with filial reverence, treating her husband with the deference due a guest. Cheng Xiang relied on her inner support, honoring and respecting her all the more. Yet Lady Hou remained humble and self-disciplined, never presuming to decide even minor matters without first seeking his counsel. She cared for all her stepchildren as if they were her own, treating her husband’s younger cousins and aunts with the same attentiveness as her own kin. She governed the household with order, maintaining discipline without severity, never resorting to corporal punishment. Whenever Cheng Xiang was angered, she would mediate. Only when her sons erred would she not conceal their faults, saying, “A son’s failings stem from his mother shielding his mistakes and remaining unaware of them.” Her discipline allowed no leniency. If her children, even at a young age, walked too hastily, she would rebuke them, saying, “Had you walked calmly, would you have stumbled?” When meals were placed beside her, she often ate only plain porridge, and if her children sought richer fare, she would scold them, saying, “If you indulge your desires now, what will you become when you grow older?” If they quarreled with others, even when in the right, she would not take their side, saying, “One should fear their inability to yield, not their inability to prevail.” Thus, the Two Chengs lived their lives without fuss over food or clothing, never speaking ill of others—such was the effect of her teaching.

From her childhood at seven or eight, Lady Hou recited the poem *“A woman does not go out at night,”* and from then on, she never left her chambers. As she grew older, she loved literature but did not indulge in ornate compositions. If she saw someone circulating writings or letters, she would investigate, deeming it improper.

The record states: Yichuan instructed his household, saying, “In family life, between flesh and blood, between father and son, people often let emotion override ritual and let affection override righteousness. Only by not allowing private love to obscure proper principle can one succeed.” Thus, in the hexagram *Household*, the essence lies in maintaining dignity to ensure good fortune. The *Guimei* hexagram’s second nine says, “She guards her secluded chastity, never straying from the constant and correct path.” Yet the world takes frivolity as normal and views steadfastness as unusual. These words were meant for Lady Hou. Looking back, her wisdom as a wife and virtue as a mother shine forth; looking forward, her model of feminine conduct and exemplary womanhood stands resplendent. Such a record must not be omitted.

From the *Records of Illustrious Ministers*: Xin Ciying was pure in conduct and upright in bearing, keeping far from sensual indulgence. He and his wife treated each other with the respect due guests. Even in private, she maintained a dignified demeanor, sat properly, and spoke sincerely. Admiring the character of Chao Youyuan and Sima Wenzheng, he guarded himself with ritual, carefully avoiding suspicion. Even his servants and maids were not seen unless properly attired. When the Prefect of Poyang, Cheng Mai, sent him fresh fruit and silver, he refused it. Though he endured hardship and poverty in turbulent times, unable to support himself, he would not accept even a single bowl of porridge without justification. The Emperor remarked, “Your reputation for integrity is well-known; they say you do not accept your salary in Fujian.” Xin Ciying replied, “I entered office out of poverty—how could I refuse my salary? I only decline what I ought not to accept.” The Emperor said, “If everyone were like you, how could the realm not be at peace?”

The record states: “If civil officials do not love money and military officers do not fear death, the world will be at peace.” These words were once spoken by Yue Fei, and the Emperor was well aware of them—yet he failed to act upon them. As for the rise of the Jianmu era, it began with a scholar whose words moved the court.

On an auspicious day of the Lantern Festival in the *dingwei* year of the Wanli reign (1607), Zhang Guoxiang, the Orthodox Successor of the Zhengyi Tradition, Devout Practitioner of the Dao, Expounder of the Mysteries, Great Perfected Master, and Overseer of Daoist Affairs Under Heaven, respectfully oversaw the carving of the woodblocks.

The Rites of Fraternal Bonds

Mencius said: "Desiring to see one another constantly, they come ceaselessly like flowing water, without the formality of tribute, meeting as kin rather than through state protocol."

The record states: "The term 'constantly' (*changchang*) signifies unbroken succession. Consider Emperor Jing of Han and his brother, the King of Liang—though their mutual warnings and escorts were frequent, such indulgence could not be sustained. The term 'ceaselessly' (*yuanyuan*) signifies inexhaustibility. Consider Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and his five brothers—though they shared pillows and blankets, even the closest bonds may falter over time.

The *jin* and *pin* rites are ceremonies of the court, while meeting as kin is the intimacy of siblings. Without tribute, private affection flourishes; without state protocol, the impropriety of usurping the ruler’s authority is avoided—thus allowing constant meetings and ceaseless visits. Was not Mencius one who profoundly understood the Sage?"

Mencius said: "To walk slowly behind one’s elder is called *ti* (fraternal duty). To rush ahead of one’s elder is called *bu ti* (lack of fraternal duty). Walking slowly is not something one cannot do—it is something one chooses not to do. The Way of Yao and Shun consists solely of filial piety and fraternal duty."

The record states: "*Ti* (弟) means order, an inherent sequence bestowed by Heaven. Thus, the elder’s rank follows the procession, while the younger’s rank attends the feast—once established, can this order be disrupted? Yet some, in their haste, abandon their elders, whether through power, favor, or gain. From rulers of great states to sons of humble households, those who confuse their place will meet ruin. Mencius, in emphasizing what one *chooses* not to do, aligns with the principle of 'breaking a branch for an elder'—both awaken the natural Heavenly nature of the human heart. In an age of chaos where such virtues are forgotten, this cannot be overlooked."

The *Xiao Ya* states:
*"Rejoicing in brothers’ company,*
*Like the blossoms of the cherry tree,*
*Radiant, resplendent.*
*None among men compare to brothers.*

*In the terror of death and mourning,*
*Brothers hold deepest care.*
*When the dike crumbles,*
*Brothers seek one another.*

*Gazing upon the plain,*
*Brothers rush to aid in crisis.*
*Though good friends may sigh in sorrow,*
*When walls divide, brothers unite to repel insult.*

*Though good friends may lack resolve,*
*Once calamity is stilled, peace and tranquility return.*
*Even with brothers, none compare to friends—*
*Yet when cups are raised and feasts prepared,*
*With brothers gathered, joy and affection run deep.*

*With wife and children in harmony,*
*Like zither and lute in concert.*
*With brothers in accord,*
*Joy abounds in profound delight.*

*May your household prosper,*
*And your wife and children rejoice.*
*Reflect upon this truth—*
*Is it not so?"*

The record states: "After *Lu Ming*, *Si Mu*, and *Huang Hua*, the *Book of Songs* continues with *Tang Di*—for the Zhou and Shao clans were the pillars of the royal house, the reliance of the people’s hearts. The Sage did not discard change for constancy, nor let righteousness override affection, nor alter enduring priorities for momentary circumstances. His impartial and loving heart shines as clearly as the sun and moon in the sky. Rain and dew, frost and snow—all serve as teachings. Thus it is said: When he errs, it is like an eclipse of the sun or moon—all witness it. When he corrects himself, all look up to him in reverence."

This is what is meant.

Thus, when harmony and joy prevail, and affection runs deep, one need not consult even parents—how much less others? When harmony and joy are profound, even the ancestral rites for one’s wife should not take precedence—how much less external matters? This is why, though slander arose and Guan and Cai faced punishment, it never equaled the later ages’ abandonment of the weight of close kinship or the distrust of brothers.

Now, thousands of years removed from the era of the Duke of Zhou, when the *Tang Di* is sung, none fail to respond from the heart. Who could remain unmoved when receiving it at the feast? Indeed, one need not shed tears—even the people of Yue would be transformed without exception.

Another poem sung at the feast of brothers and kin declares:
*With caps adorned with tassels,*
*What do they signify?*
*Your wine is fine, your dishes excellent—*
*Are they for strangers? No, for brothers alone.*
*Like the kite and the dodder vine,*
*Twining upon the pine,*
*Before I see my lord,*
*My heart is heavy with sorrow.*
*When I see my lord,*
*How joyful I become!*

*With caps adorned with tassels,*
*What time do they mark?*
*Your wine is fine, your dishes timely—*
*Are they for strangers? No, brothers all come.*
*Like the kite and the dodder vine,*
*Clinging to the pine,*
*Before I see my lord,*
*My heart is filled with dread.*
*When I see my lord,*
*How content I become!*

*With caps adorned with tassels,*
*What do they rest upon?*
*Your wine is fine, your dishes abundant—*
*Are they for strangers? No, for brothers and brothers-in-law.*
*Like the falling snow,*
*First comes the sleet,*
*Death and mourning may come any day,*
*With little time to meet.*
*Rejoice in wine this evening,*
*For the lord’s feast is here.*

The record states: Observing this poem, with its threefold structure complete, it truly moves people to their core. The magpie, though a small creature, flies, calls, and flutters with such intimacy—how could it lack meaning? The dodder vine, though a humble plant, clings and entwines with such steadfastness—how could it be severed? This is because the Sage, in embodying the heart, responds to the urgency of brothers in distress, leaving no time even to bind one’s hair. Those who regard the people of Yue as distant are like the wagtail—what do they know of brothers’ mutual dependence? Those who teach climbing by bending trees—how do they compare to the dodder vine? This is the great meaning of studying poetry and the foundation of ritual—it cannot be overlooked.

Another poem sung after the sacrifice, at the feast for fathers, elder brothers, and venerable elders, says:
*Tender are those young reeds,*
*Let no ox or sheep trample them.*
*In budding form, in full growth,*
*Their leaves lush and green.*
*Dear are brothers,*
*None should distance themselves.*
*Some spread the mats,*
*Some set the armrests.*

*Mats are laid, seats arranged,*
*Armrests set with care.*
*Some offer toasts, some drink deeply,*
*Washing cups, pouring libations.*
*Fermented wine is presented,*
*Some roasted, some grilled.*
*Fine dishes of spleen and tripe,*
*Some sing, some dance.*

*When the great vessel stands firm,*
*When the four goblets are aligned,*
*When the arrows are matched in flight,*
*Guests are seated by worthiness.*
*When the great vessel is full,*
*When the four goblets are grasped,*
*When the four goblets stand like trees,*
*Guests are seated without disrespect.*

*The lord’s descendant presides,*
*Wine and sweet liquor flow.*
*Poured with the great ladle,*
*To invoke long life for the elders.*
*Elders with hunched backs,*
*Supported and guided.*
*May they live long,*
*And receive great blessings.*

The record states: The composer of this poem truly understood ritual to its utmost. Ritual does not indulge in frivolity; people do not shirk expense. It neither exceeds moderation nor encroaches upon dignity, nor fosters undue familiarity. The Zhou dynasty’s virtue was loyal and sincere, fostering kinship within the nine clans and honoring elders without—all arising naturally, without coercion. How could it indulge in frivolity?

Though mats and armrests are set, they are not excessive; though attendants are many, they are not overburdened; though the feast is abundant, it is not lavish—how could it shirk expense? Only after toasts and exchanges does ritual unfold; only after ritual is complete does music arise; only then does archery display virtue—how could it exceed moderation? With bowing and yielding, ascending and descending to drink, seating guests by worthiness, and competing with gentlemanly conduct—how could it encroach upon dignity? Honoring elders by guiding and supporting them, invoking great blessings for long life, bringing glory to the state and blessings to ruler and minister—how could it foster undue familiarity? With these qualities, it is said: they understood ritual to its utmost.

The fathers and elder brothers respond to *Xing Wei* with:
*Now drunk with wine,*
*Now sated with virtue,*
*May the lord live ten thousand years,*
*And receive great blessings.*

*Now drunk with wine,*
*Your dishes are fine,*
*May the lord live ten thousand years,*
*And receive radiant brightness.*

*Radiant brightness shines forth,*
*Lofty and clear, ending well.*
*A good end brings goodness,*
*The revered spirit declares favor.*
*What does it declare?*
*That the sacrificial vessels are serene and fine.*
*Friends assist with dignity,*
*Dignity perfectly timed.*
*The lord has filial sons,*
*Filial sons never lacking,*
*Ever bestowing upon your kind.*
*What is your kind?*
*The harmony of household and home.*
*May the lord live ten thousand years,*
*Ever granting descendants.*
*What are descendants?*
*Heaven covers you with blessings.*
*May the lord live ten thousand years,*
*With a glorious mandate and attendants.*
*What are attendants?*
*They order your women and scholars,*
*Ordering your women and scholars,*
*Followed by sons and grandsons.*

The record states: Why, from *"Now drunk with wine"* onward, do those who praise great peace always begin with this? The *Book of Rites* says: *"Dao, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness are not perfected without ritual."* The Dao encompasses vastness, thus *"radiant brightness shines forth"*; virtue is embodied in the self, thus *"dignity is perfectly timed"*; people gather in harmony, thus *"a glorious mandate brings all blessings"*; righteousness harmonizes benefit, thus *"descendants and sons follow."* These are the deepest wishes of human nature and the purest virtues of a lord. Moreover, with harmonious qi circulating, human hearts rejoice.

Thus it begins with *"Now drunk with wine, now sated with virtue,"* revealing the lofty attainments of the king and the noble integrity of fathers and elder brothers. Even ten thousand generations hence, none can depart from this as the foundation of praise and prayer.

Alas! By this, the eight-hundred-year foundation of the House of Zhou was firmly established.

On the day following the sacrifice, the *Yi* ceremony was held, and the music for entertaining the *gongshi* (honored ancestral representative) proclaimed:
*"The egrets rest on the Jing,
The gongshi comes to feast, comes to bring peace.
Your wine is clear,
Your viands fragrant.
The gongshi feasts and drinks—
Fortune and blessings come to fruition."*

*"The egrets stand on the sands,
The gongshi comes to feast, comes to bring harmony.
Your wine is abundant,
Your viands fine.
The gongshi feasts and drinks—
Fortune and blessings come to be."*

*"The egrets rest on the islet,
The gongshi comes to feast, comes to dwell.
Your wine is rich,
Your viands are dried meats.
The gongshi feasts and drinks—
Fortune and blessings descend."*

*"The egrets are seen on the moat,
The gongshi comes to feast, comes to the ancestral temple.
Having feasted in the temple,
Fortune and blessings are bestowed.
The gongshi feasts and drinks—
Fortune and blessings come in abundance."*

*"The egrets gather in assembly,
The gongshi comes to rest, serene and steadfast.
Fine wine gladdens,
Roasted meats fragrantly steam.
The gongshi feasts and drinks—
No future hardship shall arise."*

The record states: Zheng’s commentary explains: *"It is called gongshi because the Son of Heaven refers to feudal lords as ministers. Those feudal lords who possess merit and virtue enter to serve as the Son of Heaven’s ministers, and during sacrifices, they serve as the ancestral representative—hence, gongshi. Thus, none but the likes of Zhou, Shao, Bi, or Rong could bear such a role. At this time, above there were sovereigns who maintained the legacy, and below there were upright ministers to assist them. In themselves, they were enlightened and clad in splendid robes; in others, they inspired reverence and upheld virtue. In ritual, perfect governance spread its fragrance; in offerings, jade and silk intertwined. When the gongshi was at peace, the spirits were all at peace; when the gongshi was in harmony, the spirits were all in harmony. Thus, joy overflowed, and harmony prevailed—all effects of great peace, the blessings of perfect governance. Otherwise, clear wine and fragrant viands are common to all—why then praise only the egrets and the drunken feast?*

The gongshi’s response to the egrets declares:
*"Rejoice, O noble lord,
Radiant is your illustrious virtue.
Fitting for the people, fitting for all,
You receive blessings from Heaven.
May Heaven protect and command you,
And from above, renew its favor."*

May you reap a hundred blessings,
And your descendants number a thousand millions.
Majestic and august,
Fitting for a lord, fitting for a king.
No transgressions, no forgetfulness,
Following the old ways in all things.
Dignified in bearing, solemn in demeanor,
Your virtuous renown ordered and grand.
No resentment, no hatred,
Following the will of the many.
May you receive boundless fortune,
A pillar for the four directions.
A pillar and a guiding principle,
Bringing peace to friends and companions.
The hundred lords and ministers,
Charm the Son of Heaven,
Unremitting in their duties,
The people’s firm reliance.

The Lü family of Donglai says: When the lord feasts his ministers, and the ministers charm their lord, this is the time when above and below are in harmonious exchange. In such times of harmony, the only concern is laxity and neglect. This is why the poem concludes with "unremitting in their duties, the people’s firm reliance."

Recorded here: In times of harmony, the concern is not merely laxity and neglect. What is most to be feared is the exercise of cleverness that disrupts old statutes, the use of eloquent words that subverts established governance, the preference for the young and new over the venerable and experienced, and the abandonment of humble counsel in favor of flattery and profit—all of which are enough to tarnish illustrious virtue and erode grand and ordered renown. This poem first declares, "No transgressions, no forgetfulness, following the old statutes"; then it says, "No resentment, no hatred, following the will of the many." If one can adhere to old statutes, then there are models to rely upon and established laws to measure by. If one follows the will of the many, then there are the experienced to employ and filial virtue to depend upon. In such a case, if the people are not at peace and Heaven’s blessings do not endure, if the guiding principles do not prevail in the present and a good name is not passed to posterity, I would not believe it. Yet for the gongshi to speak thus—could anyone but the likes of the Zhou and Shao ministers, Bi and Rong, have done so?

In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*: In the second year of Duke Wen, on the dingmao day of the eighth month, sacrifices were offered at the Grand Temple, and Duke Xi was elevated in rank. Recorded here: I observe that in the Spring and Autumn period, the chaos and usurpations each had their beginnings. If Duke Zhuang could be deceived, then Lady Ai Jiang could be summoned. If Lady Ai Jiang could be summoned, then Duke Xi could be elevated. Thus, the ancient sage-kings were cautious and deliberate, for if compelled, a single misstep could lead to the ways of the Yi and Di barbarians, and a second misstep to the ways of beasts. Could one not be cautious?

There was the argument of Xia Gong Fuji—this is the way of barbarians and beasts. Hence it is said: If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated?

In the *Zuozhuan*: The Marquis of Jin sent Gong Shuo to present the spoils of Qi to the Zhou king, but the king refused to receive him and dispatched Duke Xiang of Shan to decline on his behalf, saying: "The Man, Yi, Rong, and Di barbarians do not follow the king’s commands. When they are dissolute and violate constant norms, the king commands their punishment, and they present spoils. The king personally receives and rewards them to punish disrespect and encourage merit. But when brothers, nephews, and uncles invade and disrupt the king’s domains, the king commands their punishment, and they merely report their actions—no spoils are presented. This is to respect kinship and prohibit wickedness. Now, uncle, you have achieved merit against Qi, yet you have not sent a minister of command to console me. Though I wish to favor Gong Bo, he holds no office under the king and has violated the rites of the former kings. How dare I abandon old customs to shame you, uncle?"

Zhuang Bo could not respond. The king ordered the spoils to be entrusted to the three officials, and the rites were conducted as for a lord who had defeated an enemy, with the grandee sent to offer congratulations—a rank below that for ministers.

Recorded here: The Marquis of Jin’s dispatch of Gong Shuo and Gong Shuo’s presentation of Qi’s spoils were for profit. The king’s dispatch of Duke Xiang of Shan and Duke Xiang’s response to the Marquis of Jin were for righteousness. Since the campaign against Qi was for profit, the king demanded righteousness from Jin. The king’s refusal to receive Zhuang Bo had its reasons—why then should there be private feasting and bribes? It is like raising a child: one wishes them to be upright, yet offers them pears, chestnuts, jujubes, and persimmons—who can say what will come of it? Or like playing with a guard: one indulges their play, yet suddenly adopts a stern countenance—who can say what will come of it? Why was this done? At that time, Duke Xiang of Shan was at court, and Wangsun Man held office and settled matters. Even if the king wished to treat it as child’s play, what could he do with these two ministers? Yet when Wangsun Su later disputed with Liu Kang Gong over the tally, the original intent of pacifying the Rong was lost. One could not help but descend into child’s play.

In the *Book of Later Han*: Emperor Guangwu, considering that King Qiang of Donghai had been deposed without fault and had conducted himself with propriety, bestowed upon him a generous enfeoffment, granting him the twenty-nine counties of Lu Commandery in addition to his own, along with tiger-guards bearing bannered spears. The palace halls were adorned with bells and chimes, equaling the imperial carriage. When King Qiang arrived in his domain, he repeatedly memorialized to decline and return Donghai, and further, through the Crown Prince, firmly declined. The emperor did not permit it and deeply praised him, presenting King Qiang’s memorial to the public ministers.

Earlier, King Gong of Lu had favored palace construction and built the Lingguang Hall, which was grand and magnificent and still stood at that time. Thus, the emperor decreed that King Qiang reside in the palaces of Lu, with rituals and music distinct in every detail. In the first year of Yongping, the king fell ill, and Emperor Ming dispatched a eunuch attendant with imperial physicians to attend to him. He also ordered the kings of Pei, Jinan, and Huaiyang to visit Lu, their carriages following one after another without cease. When the king passed away, the emperor was deeply grieved. Accompanying the empress dowager, he went to the Jinmen Pavilion to mourn. He sent the Minister of Works with the imperial staff to oversee the funeral, assisted by the Grand Master of Ceremonies and the Chamberlain for the Imperial Clan, with the Superintendent of the Imperial Household in charge of the funeral rites. The king was posthumously honored with exceptional rites: a dragon banner, bannered spears, a phoenix carriage, a dragon canopy, and a hundred tiger-guards. The emperor decreed that King Ying of Chu, King Xu of Zhao, King Xing of Beihai, the Princess of Guantao, and the imperial relatives in the capital, along with the ladies of the four great families and the young marquises, all attend the funeral.

The emperor, reflecting on the king’s deep commitment to humility and frugality and his aversion to lavish burials, feared violating his wishes. Thus, he specially decreed to the eunuch attendant Du Cen and the tutor and prime minister of Donghai: "The king was reverent, frugal, and fond of ritual, ending his life with virtue. The funeral offerings must be simple and restrained to manifest the king’s noble and singular conduct."

The Record states: In the hexagram *Sun* (*Decrease*), the first nine reads: "Having completed one’s affairs, to proceed further is deluded—no blame." The six in the fifth place reads: "Someone increases it: a tortoise worth ten cowries cannot refuse—supreme fortune." The king, by yielding the imperial vessels to the sunlit [hall], and the emperor, by altering the succession to the next in line, were like those who decrease yet rely on the increase of the first line.

Having yielded in matters of honor, he was further able to diminish himself without considering it a merit. The emperor, restored to his rightful place of honor, reflected on the king’s steadfast humility and frugality, his devotion to restraint and decrease, and his profound attainment of emptiness at the center with perfect responsiveness. Compared to those of Tang times called the "Abdicated Emperor," he cannot be spoken of in the same breath. This supreme goodness and fortune cannot be surpassed.

When Emperor Suzong honored the Prince of Dongping, Yu, he surpassed all precedents, and no other prince could compare. In the seventh year of *Jianchu*, when the prince came to court, the emperor granted his request and specially bestowed fifteen million cash for his travel expenses. Fearing the prince might suffer from the cold dew, the emperor dispatched an emissary to present him with a sable fur, along with delicacies and rare fruits from the imperial kitchens. He sent the Grand Herald Dou Gu to welcome him beyond the suburbs with the imperial insignia.

The emperor personally inspected the prince’s residence, arranging curtains and bedding in advance, and ensuring that money, silk, and utensils were all abundantly provided. He issued an edict, saying: "The *Book of Songs* states: 'Uncle, establish yourself—reverence for the eldest son reaches its utmost.' In the past, the Chancellor Xiao was honored by being addressed without his name, to favor the loyal and worthy. How much more should this apply to one who is both kin and honored?" Thus, the princes of Pei, Jinan, Dongping, and Zhongshan were all addressed without their names in court.

When Cang arrived, he ascended the hall before performing the bow, and the Son of Heaven personally returned the courtesy. Thereafter, whenever the princes entered the palace, the emperor would greet them according to their rank and only dismount upon reaching the inner chambers. Cang, feeling the emperor’s grace exceeded propriety, was ill at ease and submitted a memorial to decline the honors. The emperor, upon reading it, esteemed him even more.

When the imperial cortege saw him off, the emperor wept as they parted, and again bestowed upon him imperial robes and carriages, rare treasures and horses, and money and silk numbering in the hundreds of millions.

The Record states: Fan Ye’s commentary says: Confucius praised "poverty with joy, wealth with love of ritual." If the Prince of Dongping, Xian, could be called one who loved ritual, then so be it. In declining the closest of kin and forsaking the empress dowager, how could he have sought merely to establish a reputation or abandon filial duty? For when suspicion blurs discernment, rifts arise; when encumbrances draw near, greatness is lost. This is what the wise sigh over.

Alas! To distance oneself from rifts and preserve loyalty, to cast off encumbrances and fulfill filial piety—such was the resolve of the Prince of Dongping. Thus, it is recorded.

From *The Book of Wei*: The Yang family lineage was pure and generous, valuing righteousness and yielding. Among the brothers, their service to one another was as between father and son. Yang Zhuang and Yang Jin were reverent, modest, loyal, and dutiful. Seated in the hall, they faced each other all day without ever retiring indoors. If there was but a single dish or a single meal, they ate together. Within the hall, curtains and screens were often hung to serve as resting places, where each would retire to rest before reuniting to converse and laugh. Though they passed sixty years of age and all rose to high office, they continued to inquire after one another morning and night. Once, when Zhuang returned drunk from elsewhere, Jin supported him back to his chamber and rested by his bedside, awaiting his condition. Their sons and nephews lined the steps below, yet if not bidden to sit, none dared take a seat. Whenever Jin went out and did not return by dusk, none dared eat first. Only after his return would they share a meal, whereupon he personally handed them spoons and chopsticks, tasting each dish before them. When Jin governed four provinces and Zhuang remained in the capital, Jin would send seasonal delicacies with envoys whenever possible. If none were sent, Zhuang would not taste them first. Within the household of over a hundred men and women, all shared the same hearth, and no discordant word was heard in the courtyard.

The Record states: The histories praise the Yang brothers for their loyalty, integrity, modesty, and prudence, bearing responsibilities both within and beyond the court. As high ministers and provincial governors, their glory spanned generations, yet their words and demeanor remained humble, arising from utmost sincerity. Their reverent virtue and cautious conduct became a model for the age. Since the founding of the Later Wei, no other family has matched them. Their sons and nephews distinguished themselves, filling the court with officials in blue and purple robes—a blessing borne of accumulated goodness.

When the rebel Hu usurped the court, wielding cruel punishments and spreading poison, how could such a family meet such disaster—was this not a reversal of reward and retribution?

I say: Not so. Confucius said: "In a state with the Dao, to be poor and lowly is a shame. In a state without the Dao, to be prosperous and noble is a shame." The ancients did not rely on their inherited blessings to secure lasting peace, and this was no accident. The Yang family, in the flourishing era of the Northern Wei, embodied righteousness and devoted themselves to public service, serving their lord with loyalty—who could deny this? Yet after Emperor Xiaowen, the sovereign grew ever more immature, governance decayed day by day, empresses usurped power, treacherous ministers seized control, and the realm fell into chaos. The Wei had ceased to be a true state. At such a time, Yang Bo observed the world from afar, realizing that accumulated blessings could not be relied upon, while inherited peril brought only grief. He relinquished the highest honors of the court as readily as Guang Shou of Han—who could have taken them from him? By the time the Erzhu clan rose, murdering the emperor and drowning the empress dowager, spreading their poison across all living things, disaster had become inevitable. Thus, the calamity that befell Zhuang and Jin was not merely more brutal than the slander endured by Shilong, nor did it first manifest when Yuan Chao entered Luoyang. It was not only more perilous after Emperor Jiemin’s edict, but had its roots even earlier, in the days when Emperor Xiaozhuang served as Attendant-in-Ordinary. In this light, reverent virtue and cautious conduct merely bestowed the reputation of a model, while the privileges of power and favor across generations became a grave warning for the wise.

The Boling Cui clan, with Cui Ting at its head, maintained three generations under one roof, their household governed by ritual and deference. Ting and his brother Zhen yielded fields and dwellings to each other, content in their modesty. His sons—Xiaofen, Xiaozhang, Xiaoyan, Xiaozhi, and Xiaozheng—were filial, fraternal, and deeply kind. When Xiaoyan and Xiaozheng passed away, Xiaofen and the others wept in inconsolable grief, abstaining from meat and vegetables, their faces gaunt with sorrow, moving all who saw them. Xiaozhang and the others served Xiaofen with utmost reverence, rising and sitting, eating and withdrawing only at his command. They rose at the cock’s crow, greeting him each morning with care, and not a single coin or length of silk entered their private chambers. For weddings and funerals, they pooled resources and divided them equally. Their wives, too, lived in mutual affection, sharing all they had. After their uncle Zhen’s death, they served their aunt Lady Li as if she were their own mother, tending to her day and night, reporting to her upon leaving and returning, and consulting her on all household matters, great and small. Whenever the brothers went out and acquired goods of even the smallest value, they placed them in Lady Li’s storehouse, and at each season’s end, she distributed the rewards herself. This continued for over twenty years. They raised their cousin Lang, son of Xuanbo, as if he were their own brother.

The Record states: Yang Bo’s generosity and deference did not preserve his family because they had long enjoyed power and favor. Cui Ting’s kindness and sincerity safeguarded his clan because they had never held high office. Thus it is said: Blessings are to be respected, not relied upon. How fortunate is the noble man who lives in a state with the Dao, where the scholar-officials uphold ritual, and conduct and integrity are revered throughout the court and countryside. If one can uphold the rites of the scholar-official even in a disordered state, how could loyalty, integrity, remorse, and uprightness not be sufficient to rely upon? Each observer must judge according to what is fitting.

The *Book of Sui* records: Wang Ning lived as frugally as a commoner. His sons and younger brothers would not meet him unless in official attire, and within his inner chambers, all was as solemn as the imperial court. Tong sighed and said: "How worthy is Ning! He governed his household with the Four Teachings—culture, conduct, loyalty, and trust—and ordered his family with the Four Rites—capping, marriage, mourning, and sacrifice. He acted only in accordance with ritual, nearly all his life. The books of the sages were always at hand, and he never borrowed official robes or ritual vessels. His walls, roof, and household items were sturdy and plain, for he said: 'Let there be no waste.' The trees and fruit in his courtyard were planted in orderly rows, for he said: 'Let there be no disorder.' He accepted no gifts from others, ate only what he had earned, and never added extra dishes to feasts, saying: 'What is proper is enough.'"

In the early years of the Zhenguan era of Tang, Emperor Taizong refined his governance, and his ministers—Fang, Du, Wei, and the Prince of Wei—promulgated their teachings, while the works of Master Wen Zhongzi were poised to flourish. Ning sighed and said: "How great is your elder brother’s legacy! In speaking of the imperial net and the Dao of the sovereign, it is brilliantly clear. In speaking of the realm between Heaven and Earth, there is nothing it does not reach. When the world has the Dao, the sage advances and acts. When the world lacks the Dao, the sage retreats and preserves. This is what is meant by: 'Flow it, and it becomes a river; dam it, and it becomes a deep pool.' Ascend, and it becomes clouds; descend, and it becomes rain; hidden, it nourishes—where does it not bring benefit?"

The Record states: Ning’s insight was as profound as that of the most enlightened. How do we know this? The Dragon Gate was illustrious, yet when the *Twelve Policies for Great Peace* were presented, they did not fully align with his ideals, so he deemed adhering to ritual throughout his life and continuing the classics as the loftier path. If a ruler of an age of governance does not fully adopt one’s counsel, it is better to withdraw and preserve it. This is why Fang, Du, and the others, though esteemed, were not enough, while a single remonstrance from Changsun was more than sufficient. It is far better to ascend as clouds, descend as rain, and nourish in seclusion—bringing benefit everywhere—than to seek such limited influence.

The *Old唐书* records: In the twenty-ninth year of the Kaiyuan era, Prince Xian of Ning, the Grand Commandant, passed away. Emperor Xuanzong mourned him deeply, saying: "The realm was my elder brother’s realm. He yielded it to me, becoming the Taibo of our Tang. A mere posthumous name is not enough for him." Thus he bestowed the posthumous title "Emperor Rang" (the Yielding Emperor). His son, Prince Cui of Ruyang, submitted a memorial to honor his father’s wishes, firmly declining the title, but the emperor did not permit it.

The Record states: Lu Zuan said: "When the Dao aligns with Heaven, it is called 'August'; when virtue matches Earth, it is called 'Emperor.' These are the most exalted titles, the greatest of honorifics. They cannot be casually assumed—how could they be yielded like a dish of food?"

The emperor, out of familial affection, performed bows and kneelings within the palace as if among kin. This is how the celestial order of uncle and nephew must not be disrupted—such is the proper Way. Yet to yield the supreme title out of private sentiment, treating the loftiest of honorifics so lightly, leaves the recipient uneasy and the bestower acting against reason, even appearing absurd. This does not elevate the title but rather demeans it, and cannot serve as a model for later generations.

The *Song Records* state: Li Jiǎnzhī, Sùzhī, Chéngzhī, and Jízhī were all sons of Chancellor Dí. Chéngzhī was orphaned young, and Sùzhī raised and instructed him until he came of age, after which they served in the imperial retinue in succession. When Jízhī was promoted to Academician of the Dragon Diagram Hall, he earnestly declined, requesting that the post be given to his elder brother, saying: "As a minister, I was raised by my brother, and he has already served as a Grand Master of Remonstrance for a decade." The emperor replied: "The fraternal devotion between you brothers is enough to inspire the customs of the age. Sùzhī shall also be promoted." Thus both were appointed together.

Jízhī was meticulous and clear in administrative matters, excelling in every office he held. He once compiled a history of the Tang, offering insights beneficial to governance, serving as a mirror for rulers and ministers. Jiǎnzhī, from a young age, was favored by Kou Zhun. When Emperor Yingzong ascended the throne, Fu Bi recommended him for his learning and conduct. The emperor commended him, saying: "You are a venerable scholar well-versed in statecraft. I shall consult you to remedy my shortcomings—this is not merely about classical scholarship." He was also appointed as Reader-in-Waiting to the Heir Apparent and presented with birthday gifts for Prince Ying. By precedent, the prince would bow in gratitude and withdraw, but Yingzong instructed the prince to detain Jiǎnzhī for a meal, hoping to engage him in unhurried counsel.

As soon as Emperor Shenzong took the throne, Jiǎnzhī immediately requested retirement. From Minister of Works, he was appointed Grand Guardian of the Heir Apparent and retired. As there was no precedent for a retiring official to take leave at the Gate of Heavenly Peace, he was specially granted an audience in the Hall of Extended Harmony, seated, and then hosted at a banquet in the Hall of Nurtured Goodness. The lecturers were all commanded to compose poems in his honor, lavishing him with praise. The emperor also instructed Wang Gui to record the event. His son, Xiaoji, held a position in the palace service but, needing to care for his parents, requested an appointment as Supervisor of Chongfu Abbey. After a decade of quietude, he retired at the same time as his father, at the age of fifty. Scholars and officials praised them, comparing them to the two Shu brothers of the Han.

His younger brother, Xiaoda, was summoned for an audience, and Shenzong inquired about his well-being, sighing that their conduct far surpassed that of ordinary men.

The *Record* states: Hu Mingshen, regarding the departure of the two Shu brothers, believed that the heir apparent could not be relied upon—this is not necessarily so. As for Jiǎnzhī and his sons, was their integrity not genuine? Shenzong, however, indulged his own preferences upon assuming power, adopting the proposals of Wang Anshi and recklessly pursuing disruptive schemes. Could the gentlemen well-versed in statecraft have failed to take heed? Later, Xiaoshou and Xiaochen, though of one mind as brothers, were nonetheless implicated in the case instigated by Zhang Dun. With Cai Jing and Cai Bian wielding authority, how much was left of fraternal devotion? This is why the emperor sighed that their conduct far surpassed that of ordinary men.

The Lü brothers—Da Fang, his elder brother Da Zhong, and younger brothers Da Jun and Da Lin—lived together, mutually refining their conduct, discoursing on the Dao, and examining ritual, all rooted in antiquity. Scholars of ritual in Guanzhong held them in high esteem.

They once established a community compact, declaring: "Encourage virtue and learning among one another, correct each other’s faults, interact with ritual propriety, and aid one another in times of hardship." When Xie Liangzuo served as instructor in Qinzhou, Da Zhong would visit to attend his lectures on the *Analects*, always straightening his robes and composing his countenance, saying, "The words and deeds of the Sage are present here—I dare not but show reverence."

Da Jun, while serving as Remonstrating Censor, mourned his mother from the onset of her illness through the interment, adhering strictly to ancient rites in all that could be observed. His mourning observances, from the grandest to the most minute, conformed precisely to ritual. Extending this principle to sacrifices, capping ceremonies, weddings, drinking gatherings, social visits, congratulations, and condolences, he never allowed custom to obscure proper form. He compiled written guidelines for each occasion, and people grew accustomed to following them with ease.

Da Lin was well-versed in the Six Classics, particularly profound in ritual studies. He sought to revive the institutions and texts of the Three Dynasties, aiming to make them practicable rather than mere empty words, even if it meant defying worldly conventions and shocking the vulgar. When Fu Bi retired to private life and turned to Buddhist teachings, Da Lin wrote to him, saying: "In antiquity, the Three Dukes deliberated on the Dao within the court and oversaw education in the countryside—was this role altered by the rise or fall of rank, the vigor or decline of strength? Now, the Great Dao remains obscured, and people flock to heterodox teachings, doubting the Sage’s perfection and dismissing ritual and righteousness as unworthy of study. This is the moment for elders of integrity to feel compassion and act, to rouse a degenerate age—such is your responsibility. As for refining the spirit and transforming qi in pursuit of longevity, these are the practices of recluses in mountain valleys, seeking only personal perfection. How could they be expected of you?" Fu Bi deeply acknowledged his words.

The *Record* states: The *Doctrine of the Mean* says, "The Way of the noble person begins with the relationship between husband and wife." The community compact of Lantian endures even today. Geng Guang once called Huang Tingjian his father. The compact’s principles—"encourage virtue and learning" and "correct each other’s faults"—serve above all to guard against shallowness. As for "interacting with ritual propriety" and "aiding one another in hardship," these may be practiced in tandem. If, within the privacy of one’s home, conduct is found wanting, then within the village, words will lack credibility. Even in instructing a child of five feet, one would fail—how much more so for a grand minister of state?

Moreover, the customs of Guanzhong have been renowned for their antiquity since the Zhou dynasty, and the teachings of Master Hengqu are also well-known. The Lü brothers were towering figures within that tradition—what difficulty could they have had with ritual learning? This, too, is worth noting.

The *Tianshun Daily Record* states: In the year *xīnwèi* of the Jingtai era (1461), when the former emperor returned in triumph, court discussions on the rites for his restoration frequently cited the unpredictability of the northern tribes as a pretext, proposing only a single carriage and two horses for his reception.

At that time, Supervising Secretary Lin Cong submitted a memorial, stating: "Now, the northern chieftain, in awe of Heaven and repentant of his transgressions, has merely escorted the imperial carriage back. For the rites of reception and restoration, the grand imperial procession with full regalia should be employed."

Meanwhile, Minister of Rites Hu Han produced a document for Vice Minister Ye Sheng, which had been shown to him by Grand Secretary Gao Gu of the Inner Court. Its contents were earnest and impassioned, declaring: "Between His Majesty and the Supreme Emperor, the bond is both that of sovereign and subject and of brothers. The rites of reception and restoration ought to be conducted with utmost generosity." He wished to present this document to the throne, that the intent to honor and esteem might be known throughout court and realm alike.

Minister of Personnel Wang Zhi also voiced his approval, saying: "This is a matter of seeking lost rites among the common people—it should be brought to the emperor’s attention." Only Wang Wen dismissed it as nothing more than an anonymous missive. The affair was on the verge of being shelved when Lin Cong resolutely submitted another memorial, asserting: "Wang Zhi and Hu Han are both trusted ministers of the heart. Matters concerning the great principles of state should be decided by public consensus, not private discourse." Thereupon, the document was presented to the throne, and the rites for the Supreme Emperor’s reception and restoration were duly carried out in full accordance with protocol—all through Lin Cong’s efforts.

The *Record* states: Master Zhou observed, "The dynamics of the world are but a matter of power: when one side grows heavy, the other naturally lightens—such is the principle of Heaven." The sage in governing the realm ensures that neither side holds an imbalanced weight, and that neither self nor others harbor partiality or bias. Only after Lin Cong advanced this proposal did the deliberations on the heir apparent follow. Had every official at court acted thus, how could the confinement in the Southern Palace, the restraint of the imperial carriage, the rectification of the regency’s authority, or the clarification of the regency’s propriety have been necessary? Not only could the later crisis of the *Duomen* Incident have been averted, but the former guilt of Lang Li might also have been redressed. Between sovereign and subject, between brothers—why wait to seek lost rites among the common people?

*Hongdao Record*, Scroll Thirty-Five begins.

On the Rites of Friendship

*Mencius* records: Shun had an audience with Emperor Yao, who lodged his son-in-law in the secondary chamber. They also feasted Shun, taking turns as host and guest—this was the Son of Heaven befriending a commoner.

**Recorded Note:** The qi of Heaven and Earth arises at *zi* and converges at *wu*; the destiny of emperors emerges from *Zhen* and meets in *Li*. Yet Yao’s rise came through the virtue of Fire, attaining the central number of Heaven and Earth, while Shun’s rise came through the virtue of Earth, attaining the central qi of Heaven and Earth. Thus, Heaven’s number is five, Earth’s number is five, and the five positions interact, each containing the other. How could one argue that a commoner and the Son of Heaven are unequal? Though their virtue and sagacity were equal, this was truly the work of Heaven’s destiny and the numerology of qi. How could later generations dare hope to emulate even one ten-thousandth of this?

Boyi fled Zhou and dwelt by the northern sea, where, hearing of King Wen’s rise, he said: “Why not return? I hear the Lord of the West excels at honoring the aged.” Taigong fled Zhou and dwelt by the eastern sea, where, hearing of King Wen’s rise, he said: “Why not return? I hear the Lord of the West excels at honoring the aged.” When the world has one who excels at honoring the aged, the benevolent regard him as their refuge.

**Recorded Note:** According to the rites, the near-honoring of the aged was practiced thus: the House of Yu used the *yan* rite, the House of Xia the *xiang* rite, the Yin people the *shi* rite, and the Zhou people employed all three comprehensively. At fifty, one was honored in the village; at sixty, in the capital; at seventy, in the academy, extending even to the feudal lords. Thus, the two elders promptly returned, and King Wen’s transformation arose swiftly. Yet when King Wu campaigned against Zhou, the two elders’ responses diverged sharply. Why?

Confucius said: “The noble man may emerge or withdraw, speak or remain silent.” When two share a single heart, their strength can sever metal. Thus, the eagle’s soaring flight is guided by the Dao; the fern-root diet is sustained by righteousness; the exhortation against divided loyalty is secondary to serving the emperor; the rebuke at the horse’s bridle is devoted to Heaven. Taigong took the world as his duty, while Boyi took the relationship between ruler and minister as his responsibility. Yet both aligned with the correctness of Heaven’s principle and the peace of the human heart—why then compare their similarities or differences? Though the paths of the two elders diverged, their destination was the same; they cannot be divided into two.

*The Record of Rites* states: Three days after King Wu of Zhou ascended the throne, he summoned Grand Tutor Shangfu and asked: “Do the ways of the Yellow Emperor and Zhuanxu endure?” Grand Tutor Shangfu replied: “They are recorded in the cinnabar texts.” The king said: “I wish to hear them,” and then purified himself. After three days of fasting and donning court robes, Grand Tutor Shangfu, also in court robes, entered bearing the text. The king stood facing east, while Grand Tutor Shangfu faced west and recited the text’s words: “Reverence overcoming indolence brings fortune; indolence overcoming reverence brings ruin. Righteousness overcoming desire brings compliance; desire overcoming righteousness brings misfortune.”

**Recorded Note:** King Wu of Zhou honored Taigong as his teacher and also styled him “Father Shang,” showing the utmost respect. In their ritual, the king stood facing east while the Grand Tutor faced west, perfectly embodying the principle of teacher and friend—not only Yao and Shun acted thus. Reverence is the beginning and end of sagely learning. When reverence overcomes indolence, one serves day and night with awe, daring not deviate—hence fortune. Indolence is the seed of carelessness and licentiousness. When indolence overcomes reverence, one grows contemptuous of the Five Phases and scorns the Three Norms—hence ruin. Righteousness is the foundation of judgment and governance. When righteousness overcomes desire, one is not enslaved by the senses, and all measures remain upright—hence compliance. Desire is the perilous origin of the human heart. When desire overcomes righteousness, one wallows in excess and dissipation, acting without restraint—hence misfortune. These principles were transmitted by the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors of high antiquity and inscribed in the cinnabar texts. That they mention only the Yellow Emperor and Zhuanxu is an illustrative reference, fitting that one must fast and don court robes before hearing them.

*The Minor Odes of the Kingdom* sings of the joy of friends:
*Thwack! Thwack!* go the axes felling trees,
*Ying! Ying!* cry the birds.
From dark valleys they emerge,
to settle in towering trees.
*Ying! Ying!* they call,
seeking the sound of friends.
Look at those birds—
even they seek the sound of friends.
How much more should men,
not seek companions in life?
May the spirits hear this,
bringing harmony and peace.

**Recorded Note:** The *Odes* says: “The birds cry *ying! ying!*” and also: “From dark valleys they emerge, to settle in towering trees.” Clearly, this is no comparison to the destitute or lonely. Even the lines: “The phoenix cries upon the high ridge” serve as metaphors for the court. Yet how could the spirits hear this? The ancients invariably invoked the divine to show no partiality between self and others, as in: “August Heaven is bright, accompanying your emergence as king; August Heaven is radiant, accompanying your joyful wandering.” These noble men take benevolence and righteousness as their mates, morality and the Dao as their neighbors. Their mutual accord in heart and will is established before Heaven and Earth. With united hearts and strength, they secure the royal house; serving day and night without slack, they attend to the One Man. Their mutual sincerity shines like liver and gall, tested before ghosts and spirits. A single word uttered brings shared benefit to all under Heaven; a single deed established brings shared blessing to the myriad people. Thus, the harmony’s blessing endures without end, and the beauty of Great Peace descends for eternity. Without this, one harms the people and injures things, slanders the worthy and envies the capable—then court and world alike fall into chaos. The bond of friendship bears most critically on the world’s order, far beyond mere exchanges of “you” and “me” or hollow courtesies.

*Thwack! Thwack!* go the axes,
fine wine is prepared.
With fat lambs at hand,
we hasten to invite our uncles.
If some should not come,
do not blame us for neglect.
Sweep the hall, set out the mats,
arrange the eight baskets of grain.

With fat rams at hand,
we hasten to invite our uncles.
If some should not come,
do not fault us for neglect.

*Thwack! Thack!* go the axes on the slope,
rich wine overflows the cups.
Plates and bowls are set in order,
let no brother keep his distance.
When the people lose their virtue,
dry crusts and cold water bring blame.
If there is wine, pour me a draught;
if there is none, brew me some.
*Thump! Thump!* beat the drums for me,
*Stomp! Stomp!* dance with me.
While I have leisure,
let us drink this draught.

Recorded saying: What one seeks in friends, one must first offer—though one may not yet be able. The ancients’ earnest and sincere conduct was ever thus; how could others fail to turn to me? Hence it is also said: If there is wine, purify it for me; if there is none, concoct it for me. The utmost effort lies with me, leaving nothing undone.

King Xuan commanded Yin Jifu to lead the army northward on campaign. Upon his triumphant return, the poets composed songs in praise, saying:
Jifu feasts in joy,
having received abundant blessings.
Returning from Hao,
our march was long.
He entertains his friends with drink,
serving phoenix-turtle and carp in minced slices.
Who else is present?
Zhang Zhong, the filial and fraternal.

Recorded saying: Jifu, honored as marshal and a hereditary minister of the state, having strenuously established merit in campaigns and endured the hardships of hunting and warfare, would summon men of extraordinary strategy and secret counsel—#1 consulting them as advisors in council and riding beside them as his chariot companion. Such is the duty of generals and ministers. Yet why does he ascribe his success to Zhang Zhong?

For filial piety and fraternal devotion stand foremost among the six virtues and precede the eight penal codes. When the state appoints officials, it relies on these to protect the people; when a family establishes its laws, it depends on these to cultivate posterity. Thus, the governance of Jun Ya is none other than the wise counsel of Zhang Zhong, and Jifu’s reverent friendship is what the poets delight to extol.

Alas! By offering drink to advance the worthy, there is no room for arrogance or indulgence; by honoring with simple fare rather than turtle, where lies the fault of extravagance and excess? In a single feast, three virtues converge—is it not fitting to call this "abundant blessings"?

From *The Greater Elegantiae*:
At the guests’ first seating,
left and right are well-ordered.
Baskets and platters are arrayed,
meat and fruit arranged in rows.
The wine is harmonious and fine,
all drink in perfect accord.
Bells and drums are set in place,
the company rises with ease.
The great target is raised high,
bows and arrows drawn.
The archers stand as one,
each displays his skill.
They shoot at the mark,
vying for their cups.

At the guests’ first seating,
their demeanor is warm and respectful.
Before they are drunk,
their bearing is solemn and restrained.
Once drunk,
their manner becomes erratic.
They abandon their seats,
dancing wildly in disarray.
Before they are drunk,
their mien is grave and measured.
Once drunk,
their bearing turns unruly.
Thus, when drunk,
they forget all propriety.
The guests, now drunk,
shout and clamor.
They disrupt the baskets and platters,
dancing in reckless abandon.
Thus, when drunk,
they forget all restraint.
Their caps askew,
they dance with ungainly steps.
Those who leave while drunk
share in the blessing.
Those who remain drunk
are said to assail virtue.
Drinking is most excellent
when marked by proper conduct.
In all such drinking,
some are drunk, some are not.
A supervisor is appointed,
an assistant scribe attends.
Those who are drunk bring ruin,
while the sober feel shame.
Do not follow their words,
lest sighs arise.
Speak not what should not be spoken,
utter not what should not be uttered.
From drunken words,
childish babble emerges.
After three cups, they know not restraint,
how dare they drink more?

Recorded saying: The preface claims this poem was composed to lament the faults of drinking. Yet in my humble view, what the records say of Duke Wu of Wei and what the poem describes are entirely different—could it be that he reformed only after losing himself?

The Master said: Duke Mu of Qin was deeply esteemed by the sages. Yet those who sing of the guests’ feast and fail to reflect on themselves—are they not inferior to such men?

From *The Analects*: Confucius said, "Yan Pingzhong was skilled in befriending great men, maintaining respect over time."

Recorded saying: I have heard from Master Zhang: Yan Ying was wise, yet he did not know Confucius, yet he praised his virtue. Why? The Master’s friendships were based on the Dao and virtue alone, thus he valued longevity and respect. Later generations’ friendships are based on power and profit alone, hence they rush to curry favor. Yet destiny is what the Master rarely spoke of—who would say Master Zhang did not understand this?

Qu Boyu sent an emissary to Confucius. Confucius sat with him and asked, "What is your master doing?" The emissary replied, "My master wishes to reduce his faults but has not yet succeeded." When the emissary left, Confucius said, "A true emissary! A true emissary!"

Recorded saying: Among the Master’s friends were Boyu of Wei, Yan Ying of Qi, and Zichan of Zheng—all men who held rank and governed states. Yet when they sent emissaries to Confucius, they did not speak of diplomatic exchanges or official decrees, but only of reducing faults. From this, one sees how the ancients, in their mutual refinement through the Dao and virtue, never allowed even a minor envoy to be swayed by wealth or power. Boyu’s steadfast conduct and careful virtue, unwavering even in old age, were evident in the words of his emissary, leaving no room for doubt.

The achievements of friendship—even with carriages and horses, one does not bow except for sacrificial meat.

Recorded saying: One must hold this intention within. Without this intention, achievements may seem substantial, yet their absence may seem slight. Extending this principle, even when Shun received the realm from Yao, it was in accord with the mutual exchange between ruler and subject. If not for returning to the ancestral arts with reverence, where would respect be directed? If one values the trappings of office—oxen, sheep, granaries, and storehouses—reducing oneself to toil while the deputy bows, this is what displeased Zisi. Would Shun or the Master have done such a thing?

From *Mencius*: Duke Mu repeatedly sought an audience with Zisi, saying, "In ancient times, the ruler of a state of a thousand chariots befriended scholars—how was this?" Zisi was displeased and said, "The ancients spoke of serving—how could they speak of befriending?" Zisi’s displeasure was not without reason: by rank, you are the lord and I the subject—how dare I befriend you? By virtue, you serve me—how could I befriend you? The rightful ministers of a state of a thousand chariots seek to befriend such men but cannot—how much less can they be summoned?

Recorded saying: In my humble view, the ancient sages and worthies valued the Dao, and this was not unique to Zisi. Zengzi said, "The wealth of Jin and Chu cannot be matched. They rely on their wealth, while I rely on my benevolence; they rely on their rank, while I rely on my righteousness—what have I to fear?" Mencius said, "What lies with them are all things I do not do; what lies with me are all the ancient institutions—what have I to fear from them?" The sages’ Dao was vast, their virtue expansive, embracing all without exception. The worthy, however, follow the Dao when it is exalted and sink with it when it is debased—this is why one must be cautious. This can be seen from the foregoing.

Meng Xian of a household with a hundred chariots had five friends: Yuezheng Qiu, Muzhong, and three others whose names I have forgotten. When Meng Xian befriended these five, it was not because of his household’s status. Had these five possessed households like Meng Xian’s, they would not have befriended him.

Recorded saying: When one is noble and the other base, true friendship is revealed—this is one who values the other’s power. When one is rich and the other poor, true friendship is revealed—this is one who covets the other’s wealth. Thus it is said: alliances of power do not last, and bonds of profit are not intimate. Can such relations truly be called friendship? When this principle is not understood, the rich grow arrogant, the poor grow obsequious, and the pursuit of power and profit flourishes while the Dao and virtue wither. Mencius set forth this argument to establish the model for aiding benevolence and to close the door to flattery and sycophancy—this cannot be ignored.

This is not only true of households with a hundred chariots; even the lords of small states have such distinctions. Duke Hui said: "With Zisi, I take him as my teacher; with Yan Ban, I take him as my friend; Wang Shun and Chang Xi serve me." Recorded saying: Though Duke Hui’s deeds cannot be verified, his ability to distinguish the greatest worthies as his teachers and the next as his friends shows he was no ordinary man. Moreover, when the Zhou Dao declined and the custom of "felling the trees" faded, even rulers and grandees could still exalt some and humble others, treating teachers, friends, and beneficial companions as matters of praise—was this not the influence of the moral teachings of Confucius’ school? Beyond this, such examples are rare indeed.

This is not only true of the lords of small states; even the rulers of great states observed such distinctions.

Duke Ping of Jin, in his regard for Hai Tang, would enter when told to enter, sit when told to sit, and eat when told to eat. Though it were only coarse vegetables and plain broth, he never failed to eat his fill—indeed, he dared not do otherwise.

Recorded saying: As a ruler, Duke Ping of Jin indulged in excesses of pleasure, imprisoned Shu Xiang, succumbed to the sickness of dissipation, and established the office of *Luxi*, thus confounding his resolve and rendering himself incapable. Yet toward the worthy, he still observed proper courtesy, maintaining reverence and humility in his every movement—whether advancing or retreating, hastening or lingering—circumspectly upholding ritual propriety as if it yet endured. Thus, the noble man does not dismiss him entirely on account of his faults.

In the *Comprehensive Mirror*, it is recorded that Marquis Wen of Wei took Bu Zixia and Tian Zifang as his teachers. Each time he passed the residence of Duan Ganmu, he would bow from his chariot, and worthy scholars from all directions flocked to him.

Recorded saying: Among the kings of antiquity, even those who bore the imperial seal had Zixia as their teacher—how could a disciple of such eminence in the Sage’s school bring shame? As for Tian Zifang and Duan Ganmu, I cannot judge their worth. Nevertheless, that a usurper of such rank could recognize this much is still worthy of praise. Later, Marquis Ying of Wei, with humble deference and generous gifts, sought to attract the worthy, and even Mencius came to him. Though Liang was but a small state, it twice became the seat of a great worthy’s governance—could one not have striven to set the precedent? Alas, the rulers of Wei merely feigned reverence for the worthy to curry favor, wielding wealth and rank to overawe others. They bore the name of honoring the worthy but lacked the substance of employing them. Is it any wonder they ended as mere usurpers?

When Mencius met King Hui of Liang, the king said: “Venerable sir, you have come a thousand *li* without regard for the distance—what benefit will you bring to my state?” Mencius replied: “Why must Your Majesty speak of benefit? Let there be only benevolence and righteousness. Never has one who was benevolent neglected his kin, nor one who was righteous put his lord last.” The king said: “How may I benefit my state?” The great officers said: “How may I benefit my house?” The knights and commoners said: “How may I benefit myself?” When superiors and subordinates vie for profit, the state is imperiled. In a state of ten thousand chariots, he who murders his lord is invariably a noble with a thousand chariots; in a state of a thousand chariots, he who murders his lord is invariably a noble with a hundred chariots. To take a thousand from ten thousand, or a hundred from a thousand, is no small share. Yet if one puts profit before righteousness, nothing short of total seizure will satisfy.

In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, it is told that when King Zhao of Yan ascended the throne, he humbled himself and offered lavish gifts to attract the worthy. He said to Guo Wei: “Qi exploited the chaos in my state to invade and crush Yan. I know full well that Yan is small and weak, and cannot avenge this. Yet if I could but obtain worthy men to share my thoughts and wipe away the shame of my predecessors, that would be my greatest wish. Sir, if you see one who is fit, I shall personally serve him.” Guo Wei replied: “In ancient times, a ruler sent a eunuch with a thousand gold to seek a thousand-*li* horse. The horse had already died, yet the eunuch bought its bones for five hundred gold and returned. The ruler flew into a rage, but the eunuch said: ‘If even a dead horse is bought at such a price, how much more will the living be drawn here? The horses will come soon enough.’ Within a year, horses from a thousand *li* arrived in threes. Now, if Your Majesty truly wishes to attract the worthy, begin with me, Wei. How much more will those greater than I come from afar?” Thereupon, King Zhao had a new palace built for Wei and took him as his teacher. From this, scholars vied to come to Yan: Le Yi arrived from Wei, and Ju Xin from Zhao. King Zhao appointed Le Yi as his deputy minister and entrusted him with state affairs.

Recorded saying: In Mencius’ time, Shen Tong once asked him a private question, yet the name of Le Yi was never heard. The Grand Historian also remarked: “Whenever I read Mencius’ passage where King Hui of Liang asks, ‘How may I benefit my state?’ I cannot but lay down the book and sigh. Alas! The Master seldom spoke of profit, ever guarding against its source. From the Son of Heaven to the common folk, what difference is there in the harm wrought by the love of profit?” Yet in the tale of the eunuch and the horse’s head, who indeed was the architect of such a scheme? By that time, the calamity of benevolence and righteousness had grown thorny, and the harm of profit and desire blazed fiercely. Mencius, with his generation-transcending talent, advanced a discourse of surpassing insight. If one observes these two matters together, one may see that the weight of honored guests and teachers, the esteem of elders and seniors, were not in vain. As for King Zhao of Yan and Le Yi, who zealously pursued profit and never spoke of benevolence and righteousness, the instability of their lord-minister relationship was plain to see. The admonition that “nothing short of total seizure will satisfy” is especially worthy of being handed down. For in the beginning, they emerged from one path only to enter another; thus, in the end, they emerged from this path only to return to that. Then, neglecting kin and putting one’s lord last—was there anything not so? How could a Le Yi or a Ju Xin have understood this? Alas! Later generations have even compared themselves to such men—how paltry was their vision!

The *Records of the Western Han* state: The scholars of antiquity were broadly learned in the texts of the Six Arts, establishing the canons of the Five Teachings—these were the perfected laws of governance. When the Zhou declined, the words of Confucius went unheeded and the Dao was not practiced. Thereupon, he accepted invitations from the feudal lords, traveling with the rites and upholding righteousness. His seventy disciples scattered and journeyed to the four directions: the greater became tutors and mentors, the lesser became companions and friends. Thus, Zizhang resided in Chen, Tantai Ziyu in Chu, Zixia in the West River, and Zigong ended his days in Qi. When Qin unified the realm, it burned the *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents*, executed the Ru scholars, and the Six Arts fell into ruin.

When Chen She proclaimed himself king, the Ru of Lu carried the ritual vessels of the House of Confucius to join him. Kong Jia thus became Chen She’s erudite, and ultimately died with him. Now, Chen She rose from a commoner, rebelled from his penal labor to establish his claim, and perished in less than a year—yet the gentry and scholars flocked to him. Why? Because Qin had banned their studies and accumulated resentment, so they vented their indignation through Chen She.

When Emperor Gao of Han executed Xiang Yu and led his troops to besiege Lu, the Ru within the city continued their recitations, practicing rites, and the sounds of zithers and songs never ceased. Was this not the enduring influence of the Sage? By the time of Emperor Wu, Gongsun Hong rose from a commoner to become chief minister and be enfeoffed within a few years. Thereupon, he established guest halls at the prime minister’s residence, built the "Tied Pavilion," and extended invitations to worthy men. Later, Li Cai, Yan Qing, Zhai Zhao, Zhou Shi Qing, Gongsun He, and Liu Quwu succeeded him. From Cai to Qing, the guest halls of the prime minister’s residence lay in ruins, while He and Quwu repurposed them as stables and quarters for slaves and servants.

It is recorded: Our Ru, in their inquiry into the workings of Heaven and Earth, at their greatest continue the legacy of past sages and open the way for future learning; at the least, they exalt governance and bring about great peace. This ritual must not be abandoned for a single day. Even the petty Chen She understood this. Alas, the rise of the Great Han failed to honor and esteem it, allowing men like Jia Yi and Dong Zhongshu no opportunity to expand their influence, while Gongsun Hong later usurped the glory. That historians repeatedly recount this with sighs of lament—could it have been without purpose? Their sorrow runs deep. Let the reader ponder this.

In the early Han, there were the Four White-Haired Ones: Master Dongyuan, Qi Liji, Xia Huanggong, and Master Jiaoli. During the Qin era, these four men fled into the depths of Mount Shang and Mount Luo, awaiting the settling of the world. Emperor Gao heard of them and summoned them, but they did not come. Later, when Emperor Hui was crown prince, he sent humble words and gifts of silk, dispatching a comfortable carriage to welcome them. Once they arrived, they accompanied the crown prince to see Emperor Gao, who treated them as honored guests. Later, in Gukou there was Zheng Zizhen, and in Shu there was Yan Junping, both of whom cultivated themselves and preserved their integrity, wearing only what was proper and eating only what was fitting. During the reign of Emperor Cheng, Zheng Zizhen was formally invited but declined and died without accepting. Yan Junping practiced divination in the markets of Chengdu. Though the world deemed divination a base profession, it could be used to awaken the masses. When faced with questions of wickedness or impropriety, he would rely on the oracle’s pronouncements of fortune or misfortune; when speaking to sons, he grounded his words in filial piety; to younger brothers, in obedience; to ministers, in loyalty. Adapting to each situation, he guided them toward goodness—more than half of those who followed his words corrected their faults.

When Yang Xiong was young, he traveled to study, and even after entering officialdom, he often praised Yan Junping’s virtue to prominent figures. When Du Ling, the governor of Yizhou, heard of this, he rejoiced, saying, “I have truly found Yan Junping!” Yang Xiong replied, “Receive him with full rites, for he may be seen but cannot be compelled to stay.” When Du Ling arrived in Shu and met Yan Junping with due ceremony, he sighed, “Yang Ziyun truly knows men.”

It is recorded: The Han succeeded the Qin, beginning with the burning of books and burying of scholars, and ending with the neglect of scholars and the feeding of horses with fine grain—it nearly became a world without scholars or friends. Yet when a crown prince emerged to seek them with humble words, those in tall caps and wide sashes, refined and elegant, reappeared in the Han court. Could this not show that the way of friendship had not been entirely severed? Later, the lingering influence of Zheng Zizhen and Yan Junping spread through their era.

Mencius did not say: If their lord employs them, they enjoy peace, wealth, honor, and glory. If their sons and younger brothers follow them, they embody filial piety, brotherly respect, loyalty, and trustworthiness. Could these not describe such men?

When Cao Shen served as prime minister of Qi, the realm had just been pacified, and King Hui of Qi was young. Cao Shen summoned all the elders and scholars to ask how to settle and unite the people. In Jiaoxi there was a certain Master Gai, whom he sent for with generous gifts. After meeting him, Master Gai spoke of governance, valuing clarity and inaction so that the people might stabilize themselves. He expounded on this principle in detail. Thereupon, Cao Shen yielded the main hall to house Master Gai and fully implemented his methods. Thus, he served as prime minister of Qi for nine years, bringing stability and unity to the state, and was hailed as a worthy minister.

It is recorded: Cao Shen’s governance of Qi and later of the realm followed this same Dao. This shows that even the renowned ministers of the Han could find their own teachers and did not merely favor those who flattered them. How much more worthy were they than later generations!

When Wei Qing served as Grand General, all the feudal lords were subordinate to him, and none among the ministers rivaled his honor and favor. All the dukes and ministers deferred to him, save for Ji An, who treated him as an equal. Someone advised Ji An, “The Grand General is honored and esteemed—you cannot refuse to bow.” Ji An replied, “If the Grand General receives guests with a bow, does that make his guests any less weighty?” When the Grand General heard this, he esteemed Ji An even more, frequently seeking his counsel on matters of state and the court, treating him with greater respect than before.

It is recorded: Why did Ji An not bow to Wei Qing? Because a man with desires lacks firmness, and firmness does not yield to desire. Those who deferred to him did so out of desire. Ji An, being without desire, could openly rebuke him without transgression and defy propriety without shame.

You are upright as a lord—how much more should your ministers be? Some say: "Ji An often wished to enter and leave the palace gates; could he truly have been without desire?" Now, one whose nature is upright and loves righteousness is *enlightened*; one who feigns virtue while acting contrary is merely *reputed*. Ji An’s conduct was enlightened. Whether within the court or beyond it, what weight did he gain or lose?

Ma Yuan and Gongsun Shu were old neighbors from the same district and shared a close friendship. Later, when Shu declared himself emperor in Chengdu, Chen Ao sent Yuan to observe. Yuan expected that upon arrival, they would clasp hands and rejoice as in former days. Instead, Shu arrayed a grand procession of steps and guards to receive him. After exchanging bows, he sent Yuan to lodgings, then had a court robe and *jiaorang* cap prepared for him. He assembled all his officials in the ancestral temple, setting a place for his old friend. Shu arrived with phoenix banners and feathered canopies, his cortege clearing the way with warnings. Yuan entered, bowing deeply, and was feasted with great ceremony.

When Yuan later presented a letter in Luoyang, Emperor Guangwu was seated at the southern steps of the Xuande Hall, weaving silk. He rose to greet Yuan with a smile: "You have roamed between two emperors—seeing you now, I feel deeply ashamed." Yuan replied, "In this age, not only does the lord choose his ministers; the minister also chooses his lord. I am from the same county as Gongsun Shu and was close to him in youth. When I visited him before, he received me with halberds at his steps. Now, coming from afar, how could Your Majesty know I am not an assassin or a traitor, yet you treat me with such ease?" The emperor laughed again: "You are no assassin—you are but a persuader." Yuan said, "The world is in turmoil, and those who falsely claim great names are beyond counting. Seeing Your Majesty today, with your magnanimity and breadth of spirit, you match the greatness of Gaozu. Now I know that emperors have their true measure."

It is recorded: Should the emperor’s ease not have been thus? When King Liao was slain by Zhuan Zhu’s blade and Qin’s laws forbade bearing arms, Jing Ke revealed his dagger—such matters do not hinge on ease or its absence. Yet did the emperor act so deliberately? A voice, a smile, a demeanor may suffice for common men, but to open one’s heart and reveal sincerity is how one binds oneself to heroes. Yuan’s observations were made in a single glance.

Alas, the words of a persuader do not grasp Yuan’s true nature. His choice of lord arose from his innermost heart. His whole intent was fixed on the east—this was his long-held wish, not the scheming of a fickle turncoat. Had his lord been worthy of service, even if the halls were guarded and the steps fortified, he would have pledged himself without hesitation. Had his lord been unworthy, even if they clasped hands in joy, he would have seen no cause for intimacy. In the end, he destroyed Ao and vanquished Shu, never overstepping his bounds. Thus, Yuan was no persuader—he was a *virtue*-guest. What place had fleeting flattery in his heart?

*The Hongdao Record*, Scroll 35, ends here.
*The Hongdao Record*, Scroll 36: "Rites"

**The Rites of Friendship**

From *The Book of the Later Han*: In the second year of the Yongping era of Emperor Ming, the emperor visited the *Biyong* [Imperial Academy] and first performed the Rites of Nurturing the Aged, appointing Li Gong as the *Sanlao* [Elder of the Three] and Huan Rong as the *Wugeng* [Elder of the Five]. The *Sanlao* wore a grand robe with a sash, a *jinxian* cap, and leaned on a jade staff, riding in a carriage. Upon arriving at the ritual hall of the *Biyong*, the emperor’s seat was set in the eastern chamber. Envoys were dispatched in state carriages to welcome the *Sanlao* and *Wugeng* from the lecture hall of the Imperial Academy. The Son of Heaven received them at the gate, exchanging courtesies at the screen. The emperor ascended by the western steps, while the *Sanlao* ascended by the eastern steps. When they reached the platform, the emperor bowed in accordance with ritual. The *Sanlao* faced east, the Three Dukes set out his armrest, and the Nine Ministers adjusted his shoes. The emperor personally bared his arm to carve the sacrificial animal, held the sauce to season it, and raised the goblet to offer wine. The *zhuheng* [prayer for ease of swallowing] stood before him, and the *zhuti* [prayer for bodily health] stood behind. The *Wugeng* faced south, while the Three Dukes presented offerings—the rites were the same. After the ceremony, Huan Rong and his disciples were led to ascend the hall, where he lectured himself. The scholars held their texts and raised questions before him, while officials in caps and sashes gathered at the *Qiaomen* Gate to observe. The listeners numbered in the hundreds of thousands.

The *Record* states: Emperor Guangwu established the *Biyong* but did not live to perform the rites. It was Emperor Ming who personally attended and first carried out the ceremony. Today, we see the grandeur of its majesty and cultural splendor, the meticulousness of its ascent and descent, its bows and yielding—rarely has its equal been seen since the Three Dynasties. Alas! This may be called one who "well inherits the will of others and well continues their affairs." Yet it is regrettable that these rites were reserved for kings, nobles, high ministers, and imperial relatives, seldom extending to the realm at large. Thus, imperial edicts were not widely proclaimed, and local schools were not established. The *Qimen* and *Yulin* guards, the cap-and-sash gentlemen at the *Qiaomen* Gate—these were but spectators of its beauty. The so-called human ethics of filial piety and fraternal duty had no bearing on them, and the transformative power of education went no further than this.

When the emperor was still crown prince, he studied the *Book of Documents* under Huan Rong. After ascending the throne, he continued to honor him with the rites due a teacher. Once, he visited Huan Rong’s hall, where he had a seat set facing east, with an armrest and staff. He assembled the hundred officials and several hundred disciples. The emperor personally held the text, and when some students rose to pose questions, he humbly said, "The Grand Preceptor is here." After the gathering, he presented all the delicacies of the imperial kitchen to Huan Rong’s family. Whenever Huan Rong fell ill, the emperor would send envoys to inquire after him, with imperial physicians and provisions crowding the roads. When his illness grew severe, the emperor visited his home to ask after his condition. He dismounted at the entrance to the lane, cradling the texts as he approached. Huan Rong, moved to tears, was gifted with bedding, curtains, canopies, swords, clothing, and quilts. The emperor lingered for a long while before departing. Thereafter, when feudal lords, generals, and ministers came to inquire after his health, none dared ride their carriages to his gate—they all bowed at his bedside. When Huan Rong passed away, the emperor personally donned mourning attire to attend the funeral and escort the coffin, granting him a tomb site on the southern slope of Mount Shou.

The *Record* states: Uprightness and deceit cannot coexist; Confucianism and Buddhism do not walk the same path. Only after the existence of heaven and earth did Confucianism and Buddhism arise—what are they, then? The emperor knew to honor Confucianism and nurture the aged, yet he also served Buddhism. Why? This is the common affliction of those like Lord Ye. The value of Confucianism does not lie in its chapters and verses, just as the power of a dragon does not lie in its claws and teeth. To seek the pursuits of the Two Emperors and Three Kings in the studies of the *Sanlao* and *Wugeng* is like expecting the divine transformations of a spirit from the sluggish movements of snakes, lizards, and worms. Yet this is not only the case with Confucianism. Buddhism speaks of emptiness, stillness, and extinction, of seeing one’s nature through the mind, of natural wisdom and enlightenment—what need has it for the transmission of the *Forty-Two Chapters*? Thus, the essence of the śramaṇa is no different from what Huan Rong studied, and both Confucianism and Buddhism have missed the mark.

Cui Shi was broadly learned and possessed great talent, mastering the exegesis of ancient and modern texts and the teachings of the Hundred Schools. From youth, he excelled in composition. While studying at the Imperial Academy, he stood alongside Ban Gu and Fu Yi in fame. He devoted himself to classical learning and had no leisure for official advancement. During the Yuanhe era, Emperor Suzong began to revive the ancient rites and tour the sacred mountains. Cui Shi presented his *Four Tours Eulogy* to extol the virtues of the Han, his words elegant and refined. The emperor, who had a refined taste for literature, sighed in admiration upon reading Cui Shi’s eulogy. He said to the Attendant-in-Ordinary Dou Xian, "Do you know of Cui Shi?" Dou Xian replied, "Ban Gu has often spoken of him to me, but I have not yet met him." The emperor said, "You cherish Ban Gu but overlook Cui Shi—this is like Lord Ye’s love of dragons." He then ordered, "Summon him for an audience." Cui Shi thus paid his respects to Dou Xian, who greeted him at the gate in his clogs, laughing as he said, "Tingbo, I have long wished to befriend you—why have you been so distant?" He then bowed and welcomed him as an honored guest.

The *Record* states: In observing Emperor Suzong’s discussion of these two men, it is clear that his judgment was not merely about their words and writings—it already foretold the differences in their lifelong fortunes and fates. Cui Shi had previously submitted dozens of memorials, directly pointing out strengths and weaknesses. Though Dou Xian could not tolerate this, Cui Shi kept his distance and preserved his integrity. As the saying goes, "When hunting deer without a guide, it is better not to pursue them at all"—his ability to avoid disaster was fitting. Ban Gu, however, did not instruct his sons, and most of them failed to follow the law. Even the historians grew weary and fearful, reluctant to record the truth. As the saying goes, "When wives and children are frivolous, the household loses its discipline"—how could his family not come to ruin?

Chen Zhong and Lei Yi, both from the same commandery, were close friends and studied the *Lu Spring and Autumn Annals* and the *Yan Family Spring and Autumn Annals* together. When the Grand Administrator Zhang Yun recommended Chen Zhong as a *xiaolian* [filial and incorrupt candidate], Chen yielded the honor to Lei Yi. Later, when Lei Yi was recommended as a *maocai* [exemplary talent], he likewise yielded to Chen Zhong. The Grand Administrator refused to accept this. Lei Yi then feigned madness. Later, both were recommended as *xiaolian* and appointed Gentlemen of the Imperial Secretariat. When Lei Yi took the blame for a colleague and was dismissed, Chen Zhong, seeing him depart, resigned on grounds of illness. Thus, their hometown coined the saying: "Even the firmness of glue and lacquer cannot compare to Lei and Chen."

The *Record* states: In observing the deeds of Chen and Lei, their full story is not detailed—history merely records its general outline. How distant and remote it seems!

Should every person yield virtue to another, with households mutually deferring, would not a flourishing custom arise in that age? Such was nearly the case with Wang Ji and Gong Yu, who rejoiced in each other’s promotion as if donning caps anew. Yet Zhu Bo and Xiao Yu could not match this. Ren Yannian, at twelve, studied in Chang’an, mastering the *Book of Poetry*, the *Book of Changes*, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. His fame spread through the Imperial Academy, where he was hailed as the "Divine Youth." In the first year of Gengshi, he was appointed Grand Administrator of Kuaiji at nineteen. Upon arrival, he governed with quietude and non-action, first dispatching an envoy to offer sacrifices at Yanling. At the time, the realm had just stabilized, roads remained blocked, and those who had fled to the south to escape chaos had not yet returned to the Central Plains. Kuaiji boasted many scholars. Ren, upon taking office, sought out men of lofty conduct—such as Dong Ziyi and Yan Ziling—and treated them with the courtesy due to teachers and friends.

There was a man named Longqiu Chang of Wu, who lived in reclusion in Taimo, resolved never to submit to humiliation. During Wang Mang’s reign, he was repeatedly summoned but refused to serve. An official suggested compelling him, but Ren said: "Master Longqiu embodies virtue and walks in righteousness, possessing the integrity of Yuan Xian and Boyi. Even if the Grand Administrator were to sweep his gate, it would risk dishonor. Summoning him is out of the question." Instead, he sent a functionary bearing a letter and gifts of medicine, with envoys traveling back and forth along the road. After a year, Longqiu Chang finally rode a donkey to the prefectural office, requesting to be enrolled as a recorder. Ren then appointed him as Libationer of the Advisory Bureau. Soon after, Longqiu fell ill and died. Ren attended his funeral in person and did not hold court for three days. Thus, the worthies and gentlemen of the commandery vied to come to him.

The *Record* states: History tells of Yan Ziling donning a sheepskin and altering his name to advance, yet judging by how Ren treated him, he had never truly fled. At the time, a great influx of scholars arrived, and Ren, though but a youth, inclined his heart to defer to the worthy. This may be called not losing the mean of uprightness. In the end, he moved Longqiu to respond, willing to be enrolled. Confucius said: "If a friend dies with no one to care for him, say: ‘Let me bury him.’" This may well describe Ren’s conduct.

Guan Ning of Beihai, in his youth, befriended Hua Xin and Li Yuan, studying abroad together. They all revered Chen Zhonggong. When the realm descended into chaos, they heard that Gongsun Du’s commands held sway beyond the sea and fled with Wang Lie and others to Liaodong. Du prepared lodgings to await them. Upon their arrival, their conversations touched only on the classics, never on worldly affairs. They built huts by the mountains and dug caves for dwellings. Many who crossed the sea to escape hardship joined them, and within months, a settlement arose. There, they lectured on the *Book of Poetry* and the *Book of Documents*, arranged ritual vessels, refined their bearing, and clarified rites and deference. None but scholars were admitted. Thus, Du came to esteem their worth, and the people were transformed by their virtue. Where they settled, wells were dug for communal use, and men and women jostled at the ropes. Guan Ning, troubled by this, bought many vessels and placed them by the well, allowing people to draw water without knowing who had provided them. When newcomers asked in surprise, they learned it was Ning’s doing. Thereafter, they reproached one another and ceased their quarrels. When a neighbor’s ox trampled fields, Ning led it to a frozen patch, fed it, and returned it to its owner, who was deeply ashamed, as if facing severe punishment. Courtesy and deference spread beyond the sea.

In the fourth year of Huangchu, an edict called for the recommendation of reclusive gentlemen of integrity. The Minister of Education, Hua Xin, nominated Guan Ning, and an edict appointed him Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, but he firmly declined. When Emperor Ming ascended the throne, Hua Xin became Grand Commandant and resigned his post to yield to Ning, who again pleaded illness and returned by sea. Upon his return, he sat on a single wooden couch for over fifty years, never stretching his legs. The couch’s surface, where his knees rested, wore through. Though he lived to eighty, his resolve never waned. He rested in a humble lane, ate simple fare, chanted and savored the *Book of Poetry* and the *Book of Documents*, and remained content. In hardship, he found a way; in peril, he stood firm. Through danger and risk, his integrity never wavered. His voice was like gold, his countenance like jade—his brilliance only grew with time. Measuring his life from beginning to end, it seems Heaven itself had blessed him.

The *Record* states: Confucius said: "Speak with loyalty and trust, act with earnestness and respect—even in the lands of the barbarians, one may go." Guan Ning purified himself and bathed in virtue. Amid chaos, he did not stray; facing governance, he did not bend. This may be called: when the state has the Dao, he did not alter his simplicity; when it lacked the Dao, he did not change even unto death. As for his relationship with Hua Xin, at first he would not share a mat, and in the end, they could not share a day’s conversation.

The *Records of the Three Kingdoms* state: Liu Bei met Xu Shu in Xinye. Xu turned to Bei and said: "Here there is one Zhuge Kongming, a hidden dragon. Would the General wish to see him?" Bei replied: "You may bring him here." Xu said: "This man may be visited, but he cannot be summoned. If the General wishes to see him, you should condescend to call on him." Bei said: "Very well." Thus, he personally went to Longzhong to visit Zhuge Liang, and only after three visits did he gain an audience.

The *Record* states: The *Hexagram* *Jian*’s top line reads: "Going brings hardship, coming brings greatness. It is auspicious to see the great man." At the time, imperial authority had shifted, and the Han’s mandate was about to fall—hardship had reached its extreme. Liu Bei rose amid peril, his resources exhausted, with no support. Had he not possessed a resolute and discerning talent, a great and capable assistant to aid him through danger and relieve his difficulties, how could he have emerged from hardship? Thus, the image speaks of great auspiciousness, and the oracle speaks of the benefit of seeing the great man. The three visits were not without reason. Yet while Xu Shu urged Bei, the means to restore the Liu clan had already been determined from the outset—how could this be mere coincidence?

The *Wenzhongzi* states: Wang Tong’s father, Long, transmitted the legacy of the former kings and taught over a thousand disciples. Once, he sang the *Ode on Felling Trees* and summoned Tong, saying: "From the Son of Heaven to the common people, none have succeeded without relying on friends." Thereupon, Tong set his heart on traveling the four quarters. He received the *Book of Documents* from Li Yu of Donghai, studied the *Book of Poetry* under Xia Diao of Kuaiji, inquired about the *Rites* from Guan Lang of Hebei, corrected the *Music* with Huo Ji of Beiping, and examined the *Book of Changes* with his clansman, Zhonghua. Filled with resolve, he harbored the ambition to aid the common people.

Journeying west to Chang’an, he met Emperor Wen of Sui and presented his *Twelve Strategies for Great Peace*, advocating the royal Dao and expounding on hegemonic statecraft. The emperor, however, could not employ them, so he returned to teach between the Yellow River and Mount Fen. There, he continued the *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents*, rectified the *Rites* and *Music*, revised the Six Classics, and elucidated the Dao of the *Book of Changes*. After nine years, his work was largely complete, and disciples came from afar to study under him.

Among them were Dong Chang of Henan, Yao Yi of Mount Tai, Du Yan of Jingzhao, Li Jing of Zhaojun, Cheng Yuan of Nanyang, Dou Wei of Fufeng, Xue Shou of Hebei, Jia Qiong of Zhongshan, Fang Xuanling of Qinghe, Wei Zheng of Julu, Wen Taiya of Taiyuan, and Chen Shutong of Yingchuan—all of whom deferred to him as their master. His paternal uncle, Wang Gui, remarked: "After prolonged chaos, a great sage must arise. None in our age are as steeped in ritual and music as our clan—who but you can revive this culture?"

Upon his death, his disciples deliberated, saying: "Was our teacher not a perfected being? Since Confucius, there has been none like him." Citing the *Book of Changes*—"Yellow skirts, supremely auspicious; culture resides within"—they posthumously styled him *Wenzhongzi*. They arranged mourning rites with hempen garments and observed a single day of mourning to send him off.

The record states: According to a letter from Wang Ji (Zigaozi) of Donggao to Minister Chen Shuda: "In the early Zhenguan era, Wang Ning, serving as Investigating Censor, impeached Hou Junji, implicating Grand Commandant Changsun. For this, he was punished. At the time, Du Yan was Censor-in-Chief and secretly memorialized that Ning’s forthright speech was unjustly condemned. Thereupon, Wuji bore a grudge against Yan, and the Wang brothers were all suppressed and left unappointed. When Shuda later compiled the *History of the Sui*, Yan’s account of the *Wenzhongzi* lineage was included. Yet, fearing the Grand Commandant’s power, Chen concealed it and did not publish it.

Later, Wei Zheng, while presenting a memorial, encountered the Grand Commandant and asked: 'Was Hou Junji’s case truly false? Then the Censor should be exonerated. If true, why doubt it?' Thereupon, the Grand Commandant’s resentment gradually eased. Subsequently, Junji was indeed executed.

Thus, Tong’s misfortune arose not from any grave fault, yet historical records omitted him—no surprise. Even when Zheng Qiao later compiled the *Comprehensive Records*, he followed the old accounts and did not write a biography for him. What purpose did this serve? Yet how precious is the work of a noble scholar, a blessing for the culture of a thousand ages!" The record concludes.

From the *Old唐书* "Biographies of Confucian Scholars": In the sixth year of the Zhenguan era, an edict was issued to honor Confucius as the Foremost Sage and Yan Hui as the Foremost Teacher. All venerable masters and elders of virtue across the land were summoned to serve as academicians. The emperor frequently visited to observe and partake in the offering of vegetables, commanding the Libationer and Erudites to expound upon the classics. Grain and silk were bestowed as gifts, and students who mastered a single classic were permitted to enter officialdom. Over 1,200 school buildings were constructed, with the student body reaching 3,200. Scholars from all directions, carrying scrolls and bearing satchels, gathered in the capital, and the governance of culture flourished. With robes billowing and hems trailing, order and decorum prevailed in every corner—such splendor had not been seen even in the golden ages of the Three Dynasties.

The record states: Since ancient times, the people have been nurtured by the Three Bonds, and all affairs are treated as one. Emperor Taizong may be said to have fulfilled his duties as sovereign and teacher without fail. Yet how could he have known that the Dao of the noble person is vast yet subtle? Externally, the states of Gaochang, Baekje, Silla, and Tubo sent their sons to study, while internally, within the palace chambers and behind the palace gates, there was no absence of shameful conduct. This is the greatness of Heaven and Earth, yet still, man harbors regrets. Thus, those who carry scrolls and bear satchels are surely not equal to the wonder of the soaring kite and leaping fish. Herein lies why the Tang did not match the Three Dynasties.

In the seventeenth year, protocols were established for the crown prince’s audience with his Three Mentors: he was to greet them outside the palace gates, bow first, and the Three Mentors would return the bow. At every gate, he was to yield precedence to them. Only after the Three Mentors were seated would the crown prince take his seat. In correspondence with them, he was to sign his name before and after with reverence. The record states: Emperor Taizong’s veneration of the Three Mentors may be called utmost. When Wang Gui was appointed tutor to Prince Wei, the emperor bowed first; when Fang Xuanling was made tutor to the crown prince, he again bowed first. These protocols were codified as permanent standards for his descendants to uphold. Yet why, in the span of a single step, did they vanish? What was the reason? The institution of the Three Mentors originated with the Duke of Zhou, who possessed the virtue of the Foremost Sage within and upheld the laws of Bo Qin without—thus was the Way of the teacher established. As for Li Ji, the emperor sought to tame him with the stratagem of "morning four, evening three," and he responded in kind with "morning three, evening four." In the mere exchange of bows and courtesies, the timing of rising and sitting, the pace of movement—it was no more than a staged performance. How could such a thing be esteemed? Not only could the humiliation of mentors occur in the blink of an eye, but the calamity of the Five Princes was also not far off.

This is the intent of this record. When Gao Shilian served as governor of Yizhou, he convened literary assemblies, commanding scholars to lecture on the classics and histories, exhorting and encouraging later generations—thus did the schools flourish once more. There was one Zhu Taochui, a recluse who refused office, drifting among the common folk. When Dou Gui was stationed in Yizhou, he heard of him and summoned him for an audience, presenting him with robes and silks, and pressing him to serve as village chief. Taochui remained utterly silent, cast the garments to the ground, and fled into the mountains. In summer, he concealed his form; in winter, he covered himself with tree bark. He accepted no gifts whatsoever. Often, he would leave worn sandals by the roadside, and those who saw them would say, "These are the sandals of the recluse." They would leave rice for him in the same spot, and Taochui would take it at dusk, never allowing himself to be seen. Commentators likened him to Jiao Guang.

When Shilian arrived in his post, he extended an invitation with full ceremonial courtesy. Upon Taochui’s arrival, Shilian descended the steps to speak with him and instructed his officials to pay him regular visits. Given that in recent times many had treated recluses with disdain, Shilian alone bestowed upon him honors and rites, becoming a subject of praise throughout Shu. The record states: Shu retains the customs of the Man and Yi; it was not only Wen Weng alone, nor the single case of Junping, to whom this may be compared. Yet if one wishes to transform the stubborn and strengthen the weak, unless one attends with utmost care to the most lowly, one cannot stir their currents; unless one embraces the humility of the noblest, one cannot manifest their transformation. Thus, the bestowal of honors upon a humble scholar cannot but become a subject of praise.

During the Huichang era, Bai Letian resided in Luoyang, where he, along with Hu Ji, Liu, Zheng, Lu, and Zhang—six men of advanced age—held gatherings in the Lüdao Ward of the Eastern Capital to honor seniority. Two elders, Li Yuanshuang and the monk Ruman, also joined these assemblies, where they inscribed their names in verse, exchanged compositions, and had their likenesses painted as a cherished affair.

By the Song dynasty, She Qigong, along with Wang Huan of Taiyuan, Bi Shichang of Hezhong, Zhu Guan of Peiguo, and Feng Pingxian of Shiping—all having retired in their old age—formed the "Assembly of the Five Elders of Suiyang." They composed poems in response to one another, delighting in harmonious fellowship, and commissioned paintings to commemorate their grandeur.

During the Yuanfeng era, Di Gong Wen Yanbo, though possessing boundless wealth and the highest rank, conducted himself with humility in daily life, revering virtue and delighting in goodness as if he could never do enough. Scholars such as Shao Yong, Cheng Hao, and Cheng Yi, who esteemed the Dao above all, were received by him as equals among commoners. At that time, the wealthy Han Gong, having retired from his position as Minister over the Masses, gathered the aged and virtuous among Luoyang’s ministers and grandees to form the "Assembly of the Venerable and Eminent." Valuing seniority over official rank, they constructed a grand hall at Zisheng Monastery called the "Hall of the Venerable and Eminent," where their portraits were displayed. Wang Gongchen, the Military Commissioner stationed in the Northern Capital, sent a letter to Di Gong expressing his desire to join the assembly. Though Master Wen was not yet seventy, Di Gong, who held him in great esteem, invited him to participate, bringing the total to thirteen members.

Luoyang abounded with renowned gardens and ancient monasteries, graced with waters, bamboo groves, and pavilions. The elders, their brows and beards snowy white, dressed in stately robes, gathered for feasts that drew crowds of onlookers from the city. Di Gong also established the "Assembly of Shared Birth Year," including Sima Langzhong Dan, Cheng Dazhong, Xiang Xi, and Minister over the Masses Ru Yan—all born in the year *bingwu*—and had their portraits painted at Zisheng Monastery. Master Wen further initiated the "Assembly of Unaffected Sincerity." All these were flourishing affairs of Luoyang in times of peace.

The gentry and commoners erected a shrine to Di Gong at Zisheng Monastery, inscribing on its plaque a poem sent by Emperor Shenzong upon Di Gong’s appointment as Prefect of Henan, naming the hall "Hall of Earth’s Reverence." Within it stood a statue of Di Gong, imposing in cap and sword, which the people of the city revered with solemnity.

The record states: Luoyang, the center of the realm, has witnessed customs of hares startled and deer intoxicated—how many such scenes has it beheld? These elders were the vital *qi* of the state and the models of peace. Even Boyi and the Grand Duke cannot claim exclusive glory from antiquity. Thus, it is recorded.

**The Record of Illustrious Ministers of the Song Dynasty** states: When Yang Shi heard that the Cheng brothers—Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi—were expounding the lost learning of Confucius and Mencius in the region of the Yellow and Luo Rivers, he declined official appointments to travel instead to Yingchang, where he paid homage to Cheng Hao as his teacher. Their meeting was one of profound joy. As Yang Shi took his leave, Cheng Hao watched him depart and remarked, *"My Dao now flows south."* After Cheng Hao’s death, Yang Shi became a disciple of Cheng Yi

Though he repeatedly failed the imperial examinations and was about to abandon all thought of official advancement, ceasing to sit for them, it so happened that Chen Xuan of Tiantai was overseeing education in the southern capital. Recognizing him as no ordinary bird, Chen ordered the authorities to dispatch him to the capital examinations with all due courtesy. There he placed third in the provincial examination, first in the metropolitan examination, and upon entering the palace examination, emerged as *zhuangyuan* and first-ranking graduate.

Earlier, having entered the Imperial Academy by way of tribute, he was seen by Zhang Rubi of Donghai, who exclaimed, *"Can there truly be such a tribute scholar in the world?"* Bian Huabo of Jiangyin likewise composed the line, *"I bow my head in homage to Shu Ye."* Xu Wugong, a man of lofty and unyielding character who seldom praised others, humbled himself to befriend him, declaring, *"He is a vessel for the Hanlin Academy."* Once installed in the Academy, every composition he produced was immediately disseminated throughout the realm, and as his rank rose, so too did his reputation. Scholars honored him as Master Pao’an.

The record states: Ritual is that which *arises*; to arise is to be inspired and set in motion. For a time, Master Wen Ding lingered long in obscurity, yet once he was provided with the resources of a man of the Dao to be dispatched beyond the ordinary, it was as one in ten thousand. Thus did he suddenly rise, his talents and bearing towering above all. And given such extraordinary circumstances, can ritual toward the scholar ever be deemed insignificant? Can it ever be deemed insignificant?

Chen Zhenchen, a commoner of Longxi in Zhangzhou, hailed originally from the seacoast. His frame was tall and imposing, his spirit solemn and pure; at first glance, one knew him not to be a man of the dusty world. By seventeen or eighteen, he had already extricated himself from the vulgar crowd, devoting himself wholeheartedly to the Confucian calling. Once his studies were complete, he awaited recommendation to the authorities.

Upon arriving in Fuzhou, the Fujian authorities enforced their inspections with excessive strictness, offering no courtesy befitting a scholar. Thus, he took his leave and returned home. From that time forth, he no longer concerned himself with the imperial examinations, instead devoting himself to the practice of the learning of the sages and worthies.

He journeyed to Jiangxi to seek instruction from Zhang Yuanzhen, who praised him highly, saying: “Zhen dares to presume that this is precisely what I mean.” He declared, “Since the time of Cheng and Zhu, only you, sir, have grasped their true essence. Even Wu [Cheng] and Xu [Heng] fell short of this.” Thereupon, Chen returned home.

Though Putian in Minhai was home to many Confucian families, it was only with this commoner that the purity of scholarship began to flourish. Together with his fellow townsman Li Wenju and other elders, he expounded and practiced the Family Rituals of Master Wen [Zhu Xi], and thus the local customs were rectified. This legacy endures to this day.

The record states: Li Wenyu’s act of escorting his teacher was how a disciple honored his master. Wu Wending’s provision of resources for his student was how a master elevated his disciple. As for Chen Shengfu’s pursuit of what was good, though neither master nor disciple, it was how he conducted himself. These three are all indispensable aspects of the rites of friendship, and thus the account concludes here.

*Hongdao lu*, Scroll 36, ends.
*Hongdao lu*, Scroll 37: "Wisdom"

**The Wisdom of Rulers and Ministers**

From the *Family Sayings of Confucius*: Confucius praised Yao, saying, "His wisdom was like that of the spirits." The record states: The *Appended Judgments* says, "Refine it to the point of spirit-like clarity." All affairs and all things emerge from Heaven. If they emerge from Heaven, they are unseen when looked upon and unheard when listened to. Principle has no form, and thus cannot be called spirit-like. Yet when all principles are possessed and all affairs are governed, this depends on man. If it depends on man, doubts may be articulated, comparisons may be made, and the mind may awaken—this is what makes it spirit-like, not some obscure and inscrutable ghostly spirit.

From the *Doctrine of the Mean*: The Master said, "Shun—was he not a man of great wisdom? Shun loved to ask questions and loved to examine the words of those near at hand. He concealed what was evil and proclaimed what was good. He grasped the two extremes and employed the mean among the people—this is what made Shun, Shun." The record states: Yao’s wisdom was called "like that of the spirits," for its application was unfathomable. Shun’s wisdom was called "employing the mean," for what resided in his heart was neither excessive nor deficient.

Yet if one stubbornly clings to one’s own views, forcing others to comply with what is difficult to follow, this cannot be called "employing the mean." If one startles the ear with sensational claims, presenting others with what is difficult to attain, this cannot be called "near at hand." If one rejects remonstrance and adorns wrongdoing, taking cunning for clarity, this cannot be called "loving to ask questions." If one is indecisive and fails to distinguish slander from flattery, this cannot be called "grasping the two extremes." If loyal and sincere words are branded as slander, and profound calculations are dismissed as ominous speech, how can one conceal evil and proclaim good? These are all flaws in wisdom, arising from excess or deficiency. Thus the sage does not follow such paths.

Mencius said, "The wise know all things, but what is urgent is their primary concern." The wisdom of Yao and Shun did not neglect even the smallest matters, for they prioritized what was most pressing. To be unable to govern for three years yet obsess over scrutinizing minor tasks, or to eat hastily and gulp down one’s food while inquiring about trivialities—this is what is called "not knowing what is urgent." The record states: Those who are despised for not knowing what is urgent are like Emperor Dezong of Tang, who was suspicious and harsh, priding himself on his stern clarity, yet was deceived by Lu Qi and Zhao Zan. How, then, can one properly examine things?

The laws of the Yu court were all in place, and the means by which they were taught were: straightforward yet gentle, lenient yet firm, resolute yet not oppressive, simple yet not arrogant. The means by which they were examined were: lenient yet firm, yielding yet steadfast, sincere yet reverent, disorderly yet respectful, compliant yet resolute, upright yet gentle, simple yet peaceful, strong yet restrained, forceful yet righteous. Above all, one must be especially cautious of clever speech and insinuating appearances. Then, even if there were a hundred Yi and Zans, where could they find room to operate? This is why the Four Fiends could not endanger Shun, yet a single Yi was enough to throw Tang into chaos. Mencius’s words are urgent and must not be overlooked.

Mencius also said, "What is despised in the wise is their tendency to overcomplicate." If the wise were like Yu in channeling the waters, then there would be nothing to despise in wisdom. Yu channeled the waters by following their natural course. If the wise likewise followed the natural course, then their wisdom would be great indeed. The record states: Yu’s wisdom was what Gun called "unwise." The Way of father and son is rooted in human nature—one followed his nature and brought benefit, while the other forced his way and brought harm. Those who have not yet attained sageliness must take heed!

Today, those who overcomplicate things are not limited to Gun. Some are harshly scrutinizing yet self-satisfied, some are rigid yet self-righteous, some are impetuous and self-reliant, some are stingy and self-indulgent, some are opportunistic and self-aggrandizing—how could this be just one flaw? Mencius’s teaching of "following the natural course" is profoundly beneficial to the world’s moral order; it cannot be dismissed as a minor matter of channeling water.

When King Tang exiled Jie to Nanchao, he had only a moment of virtue, saying, "I fear that later generations will use me as a precedent." Zhong Hui then composed an announcement, saying: "Alas! Heaven gives birth to the people with desires, and without a ruler, they fall into chaos. Heaven, in its enduring wisdom, saw the Xia dynasty’s dark virtue and the people sinking into suffering. Thus, it bestowed upon the king courage and wisdom to rectify the myriad states." The record states: Why was Tang called courageous and wise? The abdication of Yao was achieved through culture, while the revolution of Tang was achieved through force. Yet without an inner endowment of resolute clarity, how could one know that in a single day’s inquiry, the Mandate of Heaven had already been severed, and thus truly respond to the will of Heaven above and the will of the people below?

Yet Tang still said, "Alas!" and spoke of "trust," for he feared that later generations would use him as a precedent. In truth, the people’s hearts were joyful. Even without divination confirming trust, he still spoke of "revolution." The phrase "three submissions" was Zhong Hui’s way of dispelling Tang’s doubts. Otherwise, even if one sighed and wept like Wang Mang, who presented the *Golden Coffer* to declare his innocence before the ancestral temple, or issued decrees like Cao Cao, who proclaimed his own virtue, yet remained unaware that others saw into his very heart and lungs—what good would it do? What good would it do?

Mencius was asked by Wan Zhang, "Is it true that Baili Xi confined himself in Qin as a keeper of sacrificial animals, herded cattle in exchange for five sheep skins, and thus ingratiated himself with Duke Mu of Qin?"

Mencius replied, "No. That is not so. It is the fabrication of meddlers. Baili Xi was a man of Yu. The people of Jin, offering the jade of Chuiji and the horses of Quchan, borrowed the road from Yu to attack Guo. Though Gong Zhiqi admonished the ruler, Baili Xi did not, knowing that the lord of Yu could not be admonished. He left for Qin, already seventy years of age. Had he truly been unaware that serving Duke Mu of Qin by herding cattle would be demeaning, could he be called wise? Yet if he knew the lord of Yu could not be admonished and still did not admonish him, could that be called unwise? Knowing that the lord of Yu was doomed and leaving beforehand—could that be called unwise? When he was later employed in Qin, recognizing that Duke Mu was one with whom he could act, and thus serving as his minister—could that be called unwise? By serving Qin and making his lord renowned throughout the world, leaving a legacy for later generations, could an unworthy man have achieved this? To humble oneself to advance one’s lord—would a man of integrity in his village do such a thing? Could a worthy man have done so?"

It is recorded: What is called wisdom is the ability to comprehend principles and move through affairs without obstruction. Yet while benevolence can be cultivated through effort, wisdom cannot be forced. Since the end of the Three Dynasties, those who discuss historical figures have been unable to adhere purely to heavenly principle, and thus men like Baili Xi, Guan Zhong, and Yanzi are still recorded. Observing the discussions of the "Four Wisdoms" and "Two Worthies," one understands that the earnestness of those who debated them was not without reason. Let the reader examine this carefully.

In the *Guoyu*, when Duke Huan appointed Bao Shu as minister, Bao Shu declined, saying, "Your Grace has shown me kindness, ensuring I do not suffer cold or hunger—this is your grace. But if you wish me to govern the state, that is beyond my ability. Only Guan Yiwu is fit for this." He continued, "There are five ways in which I am inferior to Yiwu: in being generous and kind to the people, I am not his equal; in governing the state without losing hold of its authority, I am not his equal; in loyalty and trustworthiness that bind the people, I am not his equal; in establishing rites and righteousness that serve as models for the realm, I am not his equal; in standing at the military gate with drum in hand, inspiring the people to greater courage, I am not his equal."

Duke Huan said, "Yet Guan Zhong once shot me, striking my belt buckle, nearly killing me." Bao Shu replied, "He did so out of devotion to his former lord. If you pardon and restore him, he will serve you just the same." Duke Huan sent envoys to request Guan Zhong from Lu. By the time he arrived, the duke had him purified three times and bathed three times. Duke Huan personally welcomed him at the outskirts and entrusted him with governance.

It is recorded in the *Xugua*: "Things cannot remain in decline forever, thus they are followed by *Tongren* (Fellowship)." The *Commentary* states: "When Heaven and Earth do not interact, it is called *Pi* (Obstruction); when above and below are in harmony, it is called *Tong* (Fellowship)." When the world is in decline, one must join forces with others to overcome it. After Duke Huan had reached the depths of decline, he suddenly rose, seeking to subdue the world through wisdom and strength. Had he not found a man of foresight and shared purpose, how could he have been persuaded to trust? Bao Shu’s recommendation of the worthy and yielding to the capable was free of favoritism; Duke Huan’s acceptance of remonstrance and heeding of advice demonstrated his resolute clarity. The prosperity of Qi arose from this.

Duke Huan sat with Guan Zhong and asked, "In the past, our former rulers built lofty palaces, indulged in hunting and archery, neglected state affairs, belittled the wise, and disdained scholars, while exalting women. The warriors suffered cold and hunger, the war chariots awaited the entertainers, laughter and jesting filled the court, while the worthy were relegated to the rear. Thus, the state did not progress day by day or month by month. What should be done about this?"

Guan Zhong replied, "In former times, our former kings, King Zhao and King Mu, followed the laws of Wen and Wu. They achieved distant merits and established fame, uniting the lords and comparing the people’s resources. They set up models to guide the people, balancing authority with reciprocity, linking and measuring with standards. They traced the root to the branch, encouraging with rewards and punishments, correcting with penalties, and ordering the people by age and rank to serve as the state’s guiding principles."

The duke asked, "How should this be done?"

Guan Zhong replied, "In ancient times, the sage kings governed the world by dividing the capital into three parts and the outskirts into five, settling the people’s dwellings, and establishing their occupations, while carefully employing the six handles of governance."

It is recorded in the *Xugua*: "When people unite, things naturally gather. Thus, it is followed by *Dayou* (Great Possession)." The hexagram depicts fire above heaven, its light reaching far, illuminating all things. This was the moment when Duke Huan and Guan Zhong sat and discoursed on the Dao.

The duke asked, "How should the people’s occupations be established?"

Guan Zhong replied, "The four classes of people should not be allowed to mix. In ancient times, the sage kings settled the scholars so that when they gathered for leisure, fathers spoke to fathers of righteousness, sons to sons of filial piety, those who served the ruler spoke of reverence, and the young spoke of brotherly respect. From youth, they grew accustomed to these ways, their hearts at ease, not swayed by foreign influences. Thus, the teachings of their fathers and elders were effortlessly fulfilled, and the learning of their sons and younger brothers required no labor. Now, as for the artisans, they should be settled near government offices, where they examine the four seasons, distinguish their tasks, regulate their use, compare and coordinate materials, and work from dawn to dusk, applying their skills across the land. They instruct their children, discussing their work, demonstrating their craft, and presenting their achievements. As for the merchants, they should be settled near marketplaces, where they observe the four seasons, assess their region’s resources, and understand market prices. They carry loads on their shoulders or heads, drive oxen and harness horses to travel the four directions, exchanging what they have for what they lack, buying cheap and selling dear. From dawn to dusk, they engage in this, instructing their children, discussing profit, demonstrating gains, and sharing knowledge. As for the farmers, they should be settled in the fields, where they observe the four seasons, regulate their use, prepare for cold and heat, clear the land to await the proper time, plow deeply and harrow diligently, awaiting the seasonal rains. When the rains come, they take up their spears, sickles, and binding ropes, working from dawn to dusk in the fields."

These three occupations, when practiced from youth, settle the heart, and those who follow them do not waver upon seeing other things. Thus, the teachings of fathers and elder brothers succeed without sternness; the learning of sons and younger brothers is effortless. The finest among the people, when they become scholars, will surely be reliable. Duke Huan said: "Excellent."

A record states: This is an unchanging, settled principle—how could it apply only to one state? Every person and every household is no different. When those above lose the Dao, the people lose their sense of duty. Scholars indulge in idle wandering, farmers are drawn to secondary crafts, the court no longer trusts the Way, artisans no longer follow standards, the noble violate righteousness, and the common people break the law. That the state does not perish is mere luck. This is why Zhong’s concerns run deep.

The Duke said: "How should we settle the people’s dwellings?"
He replied: "Divide the state into twenty-one districts: six for artisans and merchants, and fifteen for scholars. You, my lord, will lead five districts, the crown prince five, and Gaozi five. The state’s three divisions will establish offices, I will appoint three stewards, you will establish three clans, the market will have three districts, the marshes three wardens, and the mountains three overseers."

A record states: This is how Lu established its three armies. The wise must simply observe well.

The Duke said: "I wish to engage with the feudal lords—is this possible?"
He replied: "Not yet. The state is not secure. Restore the old laws, select the best and put them into practice, nurture the people and those without wealth, and respect the common folk—then the state will be secure."
The Duke said: "Now that the state is secure, may I proceed?"
He replied: "Not yet. If you properly organize the troops and repair the armor and weapons, the great states will do the same. If you possess the tools of attack, the smaller feudal lords will prepare defenses, making it difficult to swiftly achieve your ambitions. If you wish to quickly prevail over the feudal lords, then your affairs must be concealed. Implement domestic governance and embed military commands within it."

The Duke said: "Excellent."
Thereupon, the state was organized: five households formed a *gui*, with a leader appointed. Ten *gui* formed a *li*, with an overseer. Four *li* formed a *lian*, with a leader. Ten *lian* formed a *xiang*, with a *liangren* to enforce military commands. Five households formed a *gui*, so five men made a squad, led by the *gui* leader. Ten *gui* formed a *li*, so fifty men made a small unit, led by the *li* overseer. Four *li* formed a *lian*, so two hundred men made a company, led by the *lian* leader. Ten *lian* formed a *xiang*, so two thousand men made a brigade, led by the *xiang* leader. Five *xiang* formed a command, so ten thousand men made an army, led by the leaders of the five *xiang*. In spring, they assembled to review the troops; in autumn, they drilled and trained. Thus, squads were organized within the *li*, and armies were arrayed beyond the suburbs. Once domestic training was complete, no one was allowed to relocate. Within a squad, members shared blessings in sacrifices, supported one another in death and mourning, and bore misfortunes together. People lived alongside one another for generations, grew up together, and thus in night battles, their voices could be heard, ensuring no separation; in daytime battles, they recognized one another by sight. Their mutual trust was such that they would die for one another. Thus, in defense, they were unshakably solid; in attack, they were unyieldingly strong. With thirty thousand such soldiers, you could march across the world, punish the lawless, and shield the Zhou court. No ruler of a great state could resist you.

A record states: This is domestic governance with embedded military commands. Yet in Zhong’s design, outwardly it appears as deception, while inwardly it is a desperate bid for strength. His tireless efforts were all for the sake of achieving his ambitions. A noble person would not follow such a path. However, the former kings’ method of uniting the people and embedding military training within agriculture largely resembled this. Alas! Qi was but one state, and Zhong but one man. With thirty thousand soldiers, he could rampage across the world, punish the lawless, shield the royal house, and none could resist. How much more so for the majestic realm as a whole? This is something we cannot fail to ponder deeply.

The Duke said: "I wish to engage with the feudal lords—is this possible?"
He replied: "Not yet. The neighboring states are not yet close to us. If you wish to engage with the feudal lords, first befriend the neighboring states. Examine our borders and return any encroached land. Do not accept their resources, but instead offer them generous gifts. Humble yourself before the feudal lords, and they will say, ‘Our neighbors are close to us.’ When the four neighbors are all close, secure the borders and strengthen the land. To the south, reach the Yin of Tao; to the west, the west of the Ji River; to the north, the Yellow River; to the east, Ji. Qi will have eight hundred war chariots. Select the most profligate and disorderly among the feudal lords and attack them first." Within a few years of his reign, he conquered Lai and Ju, the Xu Yi and Hao Yue, and in a single campaign, brought thirty-one states to submission.

A record states: Mencius said, "Those who subdue others by force do not win their hearts; their strength is insufficient." Thus, when we observe how he pleased the ruler’s heart, even the smallest details were illuminated, revealing his abundant wisdom. Yet when we examine his shifting, treacherous intentions and the foundations of his ambitions, we see that his magnanimity was lacking. Should a noble person not cultivate the great wisdom of emperors and kings, rectify himself, and order all things?

From the *Zuozhuan*: Duke Jing of Qi was hunting at Pei. Upon his return, Yanzi attended him at Yitai, when Liang Qiuju arrived in haste. The Duke said, "Only Ju is in harmony with me." Yanzi replied, "Ju merely agrees—how can that be harmony?" The Duke said, "Are harmony and agreement different?" He replied, "They are. Harmony is like a stew: the flavors are blended, excesses are tempered, and deficiencies are supplemented. A noble person eats it to calm his heart. The relationship between ruler and minister is the same. When the ruler deems something acceptable but it has flaws, the minister points out the flaws to perfect the acceptable. When the ruler deems something unacceptable but it has merits, the minister presents the merits to eliminate the unacceptable. Thus, governance is balanced and unobstructed, and the people have no contentious hearts."

Thus it is said: there is also the harmonious stew. Once prepared and balanced, it is offered in silent reverence, and in that moment, no contention arises.

Yet Ju does not act thus. When the ruler deems something acceptable, Ju also says it is acceptable; when the ruler deems something unacceptable, Ju also says it is unacceptable. This is like adding water to water—who could consume it? Such is the unacceptability of mere agreement.

It is recorded: Confucius said, "The noble person harmonizes yet does not agree; the petty person agrees yet does not harmonize." Harmony and agreement are precisely opposite, and therein lies the division between public duty and private interest.

For agreement, profit and harm are not distinguished, right and wrong are not discerned; one merely follows the superior’s words without contradiction. Thus, such words may be heard, and what is heard may be accepted. But harmony seeks only not to contravene principle, not to avoid contradicting words. Who can avoid straying from the Dao? Yet one cannot stray from forthrightness, nor will one flatter or blindly comply to entrap the ruler in wrongdoing. Thus, such words may not always be heard, and what is heard may not always be accepted.

In essence, to advance without obsequious compliance and to retreat without slanderous speech—this is harmony. To follow or oppose based on profit and harm, to advance or retreat based on gain and loss—this is agreement.

The *Book of Changes* says: "A deviation of a hair’s breadth leads to an error of a thousand miles." Those who stand above others—can they afford not to examine this?

Duke Jing wished to relocate Yanzi’s residence, saying, "Your dwelling is near the market—cramped, noisy, and dusty, unfit for habitation. Allow me to move you to a more open and pleasant location."

Yanzi declined, saying, "Your lordship’s former ministers dwelled here. I am unworthy to succeed them—such a move would be excessive for me."

Moreover, for a petty man to live near the market is advantageous, for he may obtain what he seeks morning and evening—this is to his benefit. How could I trouble the neighbors?

The Duke laughed and said, "Since you live near the market, do you know what is dear and what is cheap?"

Yanzi replied, "Since it is to my advantage, how could I not know?"

The Duke asked, "What is dear and what is cheap?"

At that time, Duke Jing had become excessive in his use of punishments. There were those who had undergone foot amputation, so Yanzi answered, "Prosthetic feet are dear, while shoes are cheap."

Thereupon, Duke Jing reduced his use of punishments.

Later, when Yanzi was in Jin, the Duke had already rebuilt his residence. After bowing in gratitude, Yanzi had it demolished and reconstructed as a neighborhood hall, restoring it to its former state before allowing the original residents to return. He said, "It is not the dwelling that is divined, but the neighbors. You, gentlemen, have already divined your neighbors—going against divination is inauspicious. A noble man does not transgress against ritual propriety; how could I dare to do so?"

In the end, he returned to his old residence. The Duke did not consent, but after Yanzi presented his request through Chen Huanzi, he was permitted.

The record states: How wise was Yanzi Zhong! First, he declined the sixty villages offered by Qing of the Tian clan; second, in his conversation with Ji Zha, he declined both fief and governance; third, he declined the new residence and ultimately returned to his old one.

Those who know not how to preserve themselves—though they may now dazzle with splendor and bask in illicit favor, how can they be certain that one day they will not be overthrown and utterly condemned by public judgment? Thus it is said: "Not that wealth is detested, but that its loss is feared."

Amidst Qi’s many calamities, with the Cui and Qing clans’ uprisings preceding and the Le and Bao clans’ following, Yan alone stood firm in his court robes, unshaken. His virtue lay in yielding. Therefore, profit cannot be forced; reflection on righteousness is superior, for hoarded gain breeds disaster. Let the noble man be ever vigilant.

During a famine in Lu, Zang Wenzhong said to Duke Huan: "The state is afflicted. Why not use our ritual vessels to request grain from Qi?" The Duke asked, "Whom shall we send?" Wenzhong replied, "When the state suffers famine, ministers go forth to seek grain—this is an ancient institution. Chen is prepared; let him go as envoy to Qi." The Duke sent him.

His attendants said, "The ruler did not command this request—will it not appear presumptuous?" Wenzhong replied, "The worthy hasten to relieve distress and yield to the secure. An official in office must not shirk duty. I do not surpass Qi in virtue; this is no fault of the heart. To hold high office without caring for the people below, to serve as an official yet grow indolent—this is no way to serve a lord." Thereupon, he took a jade tablet and chime-stones to Qi. The Qi people returned the jade but granted the grain.

The record states: At the Kuiqiu assembly, it was decreed: "Do not block the sale of grain." To block grain was a warning of the Five Hegemons. Yet here was Wenzhong’s request, and Qi’s compliance. Why, then, in this age, is it otherwise? Even the distant Hu and Yue are as one household; how can the Qin regard the plight of the Chu with such indifference? Moreover, beneath all heaven, none is not the king’s land; within the bounds of the realm, none is not the king’s subject. Why, then, bar the sale of grain?

Ever-normal granaries and community granaries have long been established. "Three years of tilling, nine years of storing"—such foresight is distant indeed. Yet the ever-ready granary is now a pressing concern. If recruiting the people yields no solution, and state grain purchases are not yet perfected, forced loans become a last resort. Yet once corruption and penalties are imposed, how can the people’s needs be fully met? If they could freely exchange surplus and deficit, why should officials wield authority to intervene?

Consider a single prefecture or commandery: its produce is limited, sourced from its own soil, not imported from afar—this might suffice. Yet on the four thoroughfares of commerce, even in years of plenty, people rely on trade. Block but one route, and rumors spread from all directions. Markets then impose restrictions, the common folk spread falsehoods, travelers are deterred, residents hoard, and how can prices not soar? Only without obstruction will people pursue profit, undeterred by distance or summons, coming freely from afar. Though the people’s hearts are simple, they are wondrously attuned—prices rise and fall in unspoken accord.

Moreover, those whose grain we can obtain are but a fraction of those en route, while most remain unharvested. The people’s reliance on grain extends beyond those already in transit—those yet to set out are far more numerous. Has this not been considered? This is why relocating people and grain has its limits, and those who claim to have done their utmost have not truly succeeded.

Zang Wuzhong was renowned for his wisdom, called a sage in his time. When Lin Shuqi fled to Lu with his followers, claiming fame for his lacquerware, Ji Wuzi gave him a wife from the duke’s family and bestowed gifts upon his retinue. Soon after, Lu suffered a surge in banditry.

Wuzi said to He, "Why not interrogate the bandits?" Wuzi replied, "They cannot be interrogated," and He could not do so either. Jisun said, "I have four borders—why can I not interrogate the bandits within them? As Minister of Justice, you must prioritize their eradication. How can you say you cannot?" Wuzhong replied, "You welcome foreign bandits with great ceremony—how can you stop our own? As chief minister, you bring in outside bandits, then task He with expelling them. How can he succeed? Shuqi stole a city to come here, yet you wed him to a lady of the Ji clan and granted him a city, rewarding his followers. This is rewarding banditry. To reward and then expel them—will this not prove difficult? I have heard that those in high office must purify their hearts, treat all with consistency, and act with integrity before governing others.

The people follow the example of their superiors. If the people do what their superiors do not, punishments are applied, and none dare disobey. But if the people do what their superiors do, it becomes their norm—how can it be forbidden?"

The record states: The Master once told Jisun, "If you yourself do not desire it, though you reward them, they will not steal." His words align perfectly with He’s. Who would say Wuzhong’s wisdom was slight?

After Duke Xuan’s command to accept the fleeing servant from Ju, Ji Sun rewarded Shuqi; after Duke Huan’s acceptance of the He-ding cauldron, Yang Hu stole the state’s jade treasures. The proof of inciting banditry is as unerring as shadow following form, echo answering sound. Can one not strive to purify one’s heart?

With He’s wisdom, he could have refuted Jisun’s argument about foreign bandits, and none would not have respected and believed him. Yet how could private favoritism be sacrificed for it? Though he followed orders in armor, he was praised; though he breached gates and broke locks, he was slandered. He spoke justly, yet Su bore a grudge, and his words brought disaster—how far did it go!

When Duke Mu of Qin escorted the Jin prince across the Yellow River, Jiu Fan presented a jade to the prince, saying: "I have followed you through the world, bound like an ox or horse, and my crimes are many. Let me take my leave here." The prince replied, "If I do not share your heart, let it be as this river." He cast the jade into the river and entered Quwo, becoming Duke Wen. In Duke Wen’s first year, the royal house fell into chaos, and King Xiang fled to Zheng. Duke Mu of Qin stationed troops by the river, preparing to restore the king. Fan said to Duke Wen: "To win the allegiance of the feudal lords, nothing surpasses aiding the king."

The feudal lords trusted him, for it was a matter of great righteousness. The duke agreed, so he declined Qin’s forces and advanced, encamping at Yangfan. His right army besieged Wen, while his left army welcomed the king, escorting King Xiang into Zhou. He seized the king’s younger brother, Shu Dai, at Wen and executed him.

*Recorded:* The *Xugua* of the *Gu* hexagram states: "One who follows others with joy will surely encounter affairs." Thus, it is followed by the *Gu* hexagram. For one who delights in following others, affairs are certain to arise. Without affairs, what joy would there be to follow? Therefore, presenting the jade and requesting departure—how could it have been avoided? The case of Jie Zitui may serve as a mirror.

The *Xiang* further states: "*Gu* is fundamentally pervasive, and all under heaven is governed." At the outset of governing *gu*, if one can ensure that the noble and base, high and low, halt in order and settle in peace, what affair cannot be governed, what achievement cannot be accomplished? Thus, to win the allegiance of the feudal lords, nothing surpasses aiding the king—how could there be no proof? The affair of Marquis Wen’s vengeance may serve as a model.

It further states: "Beneficial to ford the great river, for going forth entails affairs." Could this not refer to the exiled prince’s Jiu Fan?

The ruler of Chu and the feudal lords besieged Song. Gongsun Gu went to Jin to report the crisis. Xian Zhen said: "To repay kindness, rescue distress, seize prestige, and establish hegemony—here lies the opportunity." Hu Yan said: "Chu has just gained Cao and newly allied with Wei through marriage. If we attack Cao and Wei, Chu will surely come to their aid, and Qi and Song will be relieved."

Thereupon, they mustered at Bi Lu, established the Three Armies, and deliberated on a commander-in-chief. The lord of Jin, having just entered the state, had instructed his people. In the second year, he wished to employ them. Zifan said: "The people do not yet know righteousness, nor are they settled in their dwellings." Thus, he went forth to secure King Xiang and entered to devote himself to benefiting the people. The people cherished life.

When he was about to employ them, Zifan said: "The people do not yet know trust, nor have they been made aware of their use." Thus, he attacked Yuan to demonstrate trust. The people, though their resources were meager, did not seek abundance, clearly verifying his words.

The duke said: "Is it sufficient now?"
The people did not yet know ritual, nor had they cultivated reverence.

Thus, he performed the great *gui* sacrifice to demonstrate ritual, and established the *Zhizhi* to rectify their offices. Only when the people’s understanding was no longer confused did he employ them. He sent forth troops to relieve the siege of Song at Gu. In a single battle, he established hegemony—such was the fruit of Duke Wen’s instruction.

It is recorded: Confucius said, “When those above esteem ritual, none among the people dare fail in reverence. When those above esteem righteousness, none among the people dare fail in obedience. When those above esteem trust, none among the people dare withhold their service.” Though Jin was but a hegemonic state, Heaven’s intent favored its rise, yet it still relied upon these precedents. This is what is meant.

Duke Wen asked Zhao Cui about a commander-in-chief. He replied, “Xie Hu is suitable. Though he has reached fifty, his devotion to learning grows ever more earnest. The laws of the former kings are the repository of virtue and righteousness. Virtue and righteousness are the foundation of the people’s lives. Those who are sincere and steadfast do not forget the common folk.” The duke followed his advice and appointed Zhao Cui as minister. Zhao declined, saying, “Le Zhi is upright and prudent, Xian Ju is wise and foresighted, and Xu Chen is broadly learned—all are fit to serve as assistants. I am not their equal.” The duke again urged him, saying, “These three virtues are your own achievements. To govern the people through virtue is of great significance; it cannot be abandoned.” He then appointed Hu Yan as minister. Hu declined, saying, “Mao’s wisdom surpasses mine, and he is also my elder. Not holding office, I dare not accept your command.” Thus, he appointed Hu Mao to lead the Upper Army, with Hu Yan as his assistant. When Mao died, he ordered Zhao Cui to replace him. Zhao declined, saying, “In the Battle of Chengpu, Xian Ju was first to act. Moreover, as my assistant in the army, he was rewarded for his military skill, for serving the ruler well, and for fulfilling his office. Xian Ju has earned three rewards; they cannot be set aside.” The duke said, “Zhao Cui has thrice declined what he declined—all for the defense of the altars of state. To abandon such deference is to abandon virtue.”

It is recorded: In observing Chengzi’s aspirations and cultivated conduct, how could one not trust him? To serve one’s lord with loyalty is called devotion; to yield thrice and gain thrice is called refinement. Those who hold the world cannot but attend to such things. Yet some, merely for hegemony, cast aside refinement, seize high position, and covet exceptional favor. Viewed today, their conduct is no better than a rotting rat. How then do they compare to Zhao Cui?

When Chengzi died, Xuanzi took command of the Central Army and began to administer state affairs. He established administrative codes, rectified laws and punishments, reformed penal cases, supervised appointments, adhered to essential principles, restored neglected institutions, reinforced hierarchical ritual, continued regular duties, and promoted those long overlooked. Once completed, he entrusted the system to Grand Tutor Yang Chufu and Grand Preceptor Jia Tuo, ordering them to implement it throughout Jin as a permanent standard.

It is recorded: The *six-five* line of the *Gu* hexagram states, “Rectifying the father’s corruption brings praise.” The Lord of Jin, by nature yielding and indirect, was devious and unprincipled, yet he was able to employ ministers of firm and upright character. Observing his establishment of governance and ordering of affairs, how could he not be deemed a man of great capability? Thus it is said: The merit of Chengji and the loyalty of Xuanmeng—between ruler and minister, father and son, their good reputation endured for generations. This is what is meant by “inheriting through virtue.”

Zi Pi of Zheng entrusted governance to Zi Chan. Zi Chan declined, saying, “The state is small and exposed, the clans are powerful and favored—it cannot be done.” Zi Pi replied, “If a tiger leads with attentiveness, who would dare offend? If you govern well, no state is too small. A small state that serves the great will find its own security.” Zi Chan took office and ensured that the capital and outskirts had clear distinctions, superiors and inferiors observed their duties, fields had boundaries and irrigation channels, and villages and wells were organized into units. He supported those among the great officers who were loyal and frugal, while restraining those who were extravagant. After one year in office, the people composed a song: “He takes our clothes and caps to store them; he takes our fields and plots to organize them. Whoever kills Zi Chan, we will support him.” After three years, they sang again: “I have sons and younger brothers—Zi Chan instructs them. I have fields and plots—Zi Chan cultivates them. If Zi Chan should die, who will succeed him?”

It is recorded: Observing Zi Chan’s governance, the state of Zheng came to understand the well-field system and schools. At that time, both could have been revived. Zheng, like Lu and Teng, was small, and its claim of being “small and exposed, with powerful and favored clans” was no empty boast. Yet when he took their fields and plots to organize them, ensuring the capital and outskirts had clear distinctions, superiors and inferiors observed their duties, fields had boundaries and irrigation channels, and villages and wells were organized into units, it was no reckless act. When he took their clothes and caps to store them, supporting the loyal and frugal among the great officers while restraining the extravagant, it was no indulgence. These two measures were remnants of the well-field system and the educational legacy of the former kings. Those who initially wished to kill him were accustomed to the withering of favor and the collapse of power; those who later wished to succeed him did so out of sincere admiration. Then who was it that cultivated the fields and plots? Who was it that instructed the sons and younger brothers? The people had truly turned their hearts toward the Dao. This was no empty talk from Youzi or Mencius—Zi Chan put it into practice. How can one limit oneself on account of weakness or smallness? Let the observer consider this carefully.

Zi Pi wished to appoint Yin He as steward of a city. Zi Chan said, “He is too young.” Zi Pi replied, “Let him go and learn.” Zi Chan said, “That will not do. When one loves another, one seeks to benefit them. Now, my lord loves him and entrusts him with governance—it is like handing someone an unhandled knife and ordering them to carve. The harm would be great. You, my lord, are the ridgepole of Zheng. If the ridgepole breaks and the rafters collapse, Jiao will be crushed beneath them. How dare I not speak fully?” He continued, “If you have fine brocade, you would not send someone to learn how to tailor it. High offices and great cities are the shelter of one’s person—how can you send a learner to manage them? I have heard that one studies and then enters governance; I have never heard of using governance to learn.” Zi Pi said, “Well said. I have heard that the noble person strives to know the great and distant, while the petty person strives to know the small and near. I am a petty person. Clothing and garments cling to my body—I know them and take care with them.”

Great offices and great cities are the shelter of one’s person—yet I have kept them at a distance and neglected them. Without your words, I would not have understood. From now on, I shall heed your counsel and act accordingly.

*Recorded:* If Yin He was deemed unfit to be employed, then Zi Gao was unfit for office. This shows how closely contemporary judgments aligned. The analogy of wielding blades and tailoring brocade has endured through the ages, winning universal acclaim. Can one afford not to pursue learning? Thus it is recorded.

When Zi Chan took up governance in Zheng, he selected men of ability and entrusted them with tasks. Feng Jianzi could decide weighty matters; Zi Dashu was refined and cultivated; Gongsun Hui understood the affairs of the Four States and could distinguish the clans, ranks, statuses, and capabilities of their ministers, while also excelling in rhetoric; Bi Chen was skilled in strategy—his plans succeeded in the countryside but failed in the city. Whenever Zheng faced matters concerning the feudal lords, Zi Chan would consult Zi Yu about the affairs of the Four States and compose numerous diplomatic missives. He would then travel with Bi Chen to the countryside to deliberate on the feasibility of their plans, before reporting to Feng Jianzi to render a final decision. Once the matter was settled, he would instruct Zi Dashu to carry it out, handling the responses to envoys and guests. Thus, he seldom met with failure.

*Recorded:* Observing Zheng’s diplomatic declarations, those that have won lasting renown—such as the debates over tribute during the Jin court audience, the refusal of the ruined wall to the Prince of Chu, the disputes over battle formations, the *Li Si* response to Yuan Xianzi, and the reply to Shi Jingbo—all remain preserved. Even today, reading them invigorates the senses and enlightens the mind; how much more stirring must they have been to those who heard them spoken aloud! Truly, words without refinement do not travel far. Can rhetoric go unpolished?

Bi Ao said to Zi Chan: “Song, Wei, Chen, and Zheng will all catch fire on the same day. If we employ the ceremonial jade scepter *quanmao*, Zheng will not burn.” Zi Chan refused. In the fifth month of summer, fire first appeared at dusk.

On the *bingzi* day, wind arose. Zi Jin said: “This is called the *Rong* wind, the beginning of fire.” Seven days hence, would the fire not break out? On the *wuyin* day, the wind grew fierce. By the *renwu* day, it raged violently, and fire erupted in Song, Wei, Chen, and Zheng.

Bi Ao said: “Had you heeded my words, Zheng would not have burned again.” The people of Zheng entreated to employ the ritual, but Zi Chan refused. Zi Taisu said: “Treasures exist to protect the people. If fire comes, the state will nearly perish. If this can avert disaster, why withhold it?” Zi Chan replied: “The Dao of Heaven is distant; the Dao of Man is near. It lies beyond our reach—how can we claim to know it? How does Ao know the Dao of Heaven? He merely speaks too much. Could it not be untrue?” Thus, he neither granted the request nor did fire strike again.

The record states: The *jiaoren*’s reproach asked: “Who calls Zi Chan wise? Yet in dismissing Bi Chong, was he not wise in wisdom itself?” Thus, treating invocations and chronicles as secondary while self-reliance as primary. If a state lacks governance and decrees, how can it resolve calamity before it arises? Those who hold states or households—can they not be vigilant?

Herein lies the principle that good and ill fortune, blessings and misfortunes, may indeed be altered. This is why the ancients always prioritized human affairs before speaking of fate or destiny.

**On the Wisdom of Rulers and Ministers**

From the *Comprehensive Mirror*:
Wei Wenhou asked Li Ke, “You once said: ‘A poor household longs for a worthy wife; a disordered state longs for a good minister.’ Now, between Cheng and Huang, whom should I appoint?” Li Ke replied, “Observe whom he befriends when in low station; whom he bestows upon when wealthy; whom he promotes when successful; what he refrains from doing when in straits; and what he refuses to take when impoverished. With these five, one may determine his fitness.” Wenhou said, “Return to your lodging; I have decided on my minister.”

The record states: Are these five truly sufficient to determine a minister’s worth? The *Book of Changes* calls Qian the father and Kun the mother; the great ruler is the eldest son, and the great minister is the steward of the household. Thus, across the vastness of Heaven and Earth and among the teeming multitudes, all are kin as siblings, all are companions as ourselves—this is the minister’s duty. Yet if one merely observes whom he befriends in low station, those he does not befriend are still many. If one observes whom he bestows upon when wealthy, those he does not bestow upon are still many. This may suffice to judge a minister of the Three Jin, but not one for all under Heaven. A minister for all under Heaven must be like those of Qin and Jin—steadfast and without other skills, his heart at ease, his demeanor capacious. Only thus can he safeguard descendants and the common people. Compared to the five criteria’s narrow scope, this is as different as night and day. Those who wish to judge ministers in the future should take this as their model.

Han Zhaohou had a worn-out chair and ordered it stored away. His attendants said, “Your Majesty is unkind—why not bestow it upon your courtiers instead of keeping it?” Zhaohou replied, “I have heard that a ruler’s every word and smile must be earned. Is this chair not worth a word or a smile? I will wait for one who has rendered merit.” The record states: In this, Zhaohou misspoke. The red bow and the beckoning bow are received and stored away as rewards for merit—this is how the former kings honored achievement. Though their spirits are few, they are not bestowed lightly upon others, let alone something worn-out. As for words and smiles, their significance is profound. Anger may provoke a rebuke; joy may elicit a laugh. The ruler’s joy and anger concern the state’s fate—how can they be compared to a worn-out chair? He merely considered the cost of his actions but failed to weigh the long-term implications for his person and mind. Indulging private affections and heeding the whims of courtiers—this is no way to speak of wisdom.

From the *Records of the Grand Historian*:
When the Lord of Pei entered Xianyang, his generals all scrambled to seize gold, silk, and valuables. Xiao He alone entered first to collect the maps and registers of the Chancellor’s office, thereby gaining full knowledge of the land’s strategic points, population size, and areas of strength and weakness. Later, when the Han King entered Rongyang, he ordered Xiao He to guard Guanzhong. Xiao He tallied the households of Guanzhong, organized transport and provisions, and supplied the army without fail.

The record states: This is why Xiao He’s merit ranked first. The foundation of the Han’s realm was thus secured. To criticize him for not collecting the books of the academicians and archivists is baseless slander. Initially, Xiang Yu and his generals had agreed: “Whoever enters Guanzhong first shall be its king.” When they grew suspicious of the Lord of Pei, though the matter had already been settled, they secretly plotted: “The roads to Bashu are treacherous, and Qin’s exiles all reside there. Yet Bashu is also part of Guanzhong.” Thus, they enfeoffed the Lord of Pei as King of Han. The Lord of Pei was enraged and wished to attack Xiang Yu, but Xiao He counseled: “To be content under one man yet trusted above a myriad chariots—this was the way of Tang and Wu. I urge Your Majesty to rule Hanzhong, nurture its people, attract worthy men, and harness Bashu’s resources. Then, returning to pacify the Three Qin, the realm may be seized.” The Han King said, “Well said.” He thus went to his fief, appointing Xiao He as Chancellor.

The record states: This is how Xiao He later employed Han Xin—not in the moment of chasing the fugitive, but at the very founding of the Han kingdom. In crushing Qin, destroying Xiang, establishing Han, and subduing Chu, he had already calculated it all in his heart. How could he not be worthy of the title of Chancellor?

The Han King asked Han Xin, “The Chancellor has spoken of you often. What strategies do you offer me?” Han Xin declined, then said, “Now, with Your Majesty’s generals, is not Xiang Yu the only rival?” The king said, “Yes.” Han Xin asked, “Does Your Majesty consider yourself equal to Xiang Yu in courage, ferocity, benevolence, or strength?” The king said, “I do not.” Han Xin said, “Xiang Yu’s manner is harsh and intimidating; though he can terrify a thousand men, he cannot employ worthy generals—this is merely the bravery of a commoner. Xiang Yu treats others with reverence and kindness, speaks gently, and weeps for the sick, sharing his food and drink. Yet when it comes to rewarding merit with titles, he clutches the seals so tightly he wears them down, unable to bestow them—this is what is called ‘the benevolence of a woman.’ Though Xiang Yu is hegemon over the realm and lord over the feudal lords, he does not reside in Guanzhong but makes Pengcheng his capital. He exiled Emperor Yi and leaves devastation wherever he passes. Though called a hegemon, he has truly lost the hearts of the people. Thus, his strength will easily weaken. If Your Majesty can reverse his ways, employ the realm’s warriors, and punish the unrighteous—whom could you not destroy? If you enfeoff cities to meritorious ministers—whom could you not subdue? If you lead righteous troops and summon those longing to return—whom could you not disperse? Moreover, the Three Qin kings were once generals who led Qin’s sons and brothers for years. When their forces surrendered to the feudal lords at Xinan, Xiang Yu deceived and buried alive over three hundred thousand Qin soldiers, sparing only Zhang Han, Sima Xin, and Dong Yi. The people of Qin hate these three to the bone. Now, though Chu is strong and rules them by force, the people of Qin do not love them. When Your Majesty entered Guanzhong, you harmed nothing, abolished Qin’s harsh laws, and the people of Qin all wished for you to rule them. Now, if Your Majesty advances eastward, the Three Qin can be pacified with a single proclamation.” The Han King rejoiced greatly, realizing he had recognized Han Xin too late. He thus heeded his counsel.

It is recorded: Observing what Han Xin cultivated, I now understand that even the most resolute warriors and nobles submit in their hearts—this is no falsehood. That jade is tempered into completion lies with Heaven; it cannot be known by human means. With Han Xin’s poverty, humiliation, and bodily hunger, the trials and tribulations he endured were already many—how could his heart not be moved? Thus, only by refusing to settle for the bravery of a common fighter did he realize the Three Qin could be broken; only by disdaining the mercy of a mere woman did he recognize that Xiang Yu could be opposed; only by not dismissing the words on nurturing the people and attracting the worthy did he understand the Chancellor could be served; only by not abandoning the ritual of erecting an altar to appoint a general did he grasp that the Han King could be served as lord. Had he not heeded Han Xin’s counsel, I would not know what would have become of him.

Zhang Liang sought to avenge Han for his grievance, so his grandfather had once ambushed the First Emperor. Enraged, the First Emperor scoured the realm for ten days but could not capture him. Liang then changed his name and surname, fleeing into hiding in Xiapei. Once, strolling leisurely by the bridge, an old man approached where Liang stood and deliberately dropped his shoe beneath the bridge. Turning to Liang, he said: “Boy, go down and fetch my shoe.” Liang suppressed his anger and descended to retrieve it. The old man then said: “Put it on for me.” Liang knelt and placed the shoe on the old man’s foot. Smiling, the old man said: “This boy can be taught.” He set a time to meet again at dawn five days later. Liang arrived, but the old man was already there. Angrily, he said: “You are late for an appointment with an old man. Go.” He set another meeting for five days later, at the crack of dawn. At the crow of the rooster, Liang arrived, but the old man was already there. Again, he scolded: “Why are you late? Go.” He set yet another meeting for five days later, to come even earlier.

At midnight, Liang went to the appointed place. After a short while, the old man arrived, and with delight, he bestowed upon Liang a bound book, saying: “Read this, and you shall become the teacher of kings.” He added: “After ten years, you will see me again. At the foot of Mount Gucheng near the Ji River, beneath the Yellow Stone—that is where I shall be.” Then he departed without another word. At daybreak, Liang examined the book and found it to be *The Art of War of the Grand Duke*. He marveled at it and diligently studied and recited its teachings.

It is recorded: In their beginnings, was there truly such a great difference between Zhang Liang and Yu Rang? In an age where the world treasured the violent and sudden—where blades flashed in alleyways and seizures were made in the streets—men like Zhuan Zhu, Cao Mei, Nie Zheng, and Jing Ke, with their daggers and sevenfold stratagems, were renowned in their time. Even one as virtuous as Lin Xiangru still longed to spill blood upon the Qin king within five paces. Such was the spirit and temper of the age, its origins stretching far into the past. When Heaven wearied of the savagery of men, the old man upon the bridge appeared, destined to aid in the rise of the Han. Only then could Zifang (Zhang Liang) discern the wisdom of patience and concealment, mastering the art of biding his time. In the end, he was celebrated for his cunning.

Thus, when viewed from what came before, Zifang was like unrefined steel or an unshaped blade—how could he have avoided the fate of a mere butcher? Yet when seen from what followed, he was like a maiden’s form or a fleeing hare—no bridle could ever restrain him again.

Liang had long suffered from frailty. When he followed the Lord of Pei (Liu Bang) into the pass, he practiced *daoyin* and abstained from grains. After the realm was pacified and he was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Liu, he resigned from the Han court, saying: “My family served the state of Han for generations. When Han fell, I did not惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜

The teachings of Yi Yin state: "A minister must not be corrupted by favor, nor seek profit from success." The hexagram of the Duke of Zhou declares: "The dragon soars to the limit and meets with regret." These are the lessons of the sages and worthies. To retire and find contentment in quietude, to roam with the red crows in leisure—this is the Dao of the sages and worthies. From the three visits to the thatched cottage to the restoration of governance, from the regency to the request for retirement, what was this if not this very Dao?

The Three Dynasties have passed, and the schools of power, strategy, and profit—what do they truly aspire to? They often know how to advance but not how to retreat, how to preserve but not how to perish. Thus, when they first encounter the deeds of Zifang, they regard them as rare and transcendent, as if he had cast off the world like a pair of worn shoes. Yet they do not realize how much he relied on cunning and followed the currents of fate.

Why is this? The teachings of the Yellow Stone say: "There is no greater peace than enduring humiliation, no greater fortune than knowing contentment." Alas! Though these words may not fully align with the intent of the sages, they cannot be rejected as devoid of the Dao. Compared to Han Xin, Peng Yue, and Zhou Bo, how much wiser was he! Had he not met the right man, I see that the scheme at Bolang would have been more misguided than the strategy of feigning illness, and he would not have been far from the fate of Jie or Zhi.

The Emperor held a feast at the Southern Palace in Luoyang and addressed his ministers: "Let the marquises and generals speak without concealment: Why did I gain the realm, and why did Xiang Yu lose it?" Wang Ling replied: "Your Majesty is arrogant and insults others, while Xiang Yu is benevolent and loves his men. Yet when Your Majesty sends men to attack cities and seize lands, you reward them with what they gain, sharing the profits with all. Xiang Yu is jealous of the worthy and suspicious of the capable; he harms those who achieve merit and doubts the virtuous. This is why he lost the realm."

The Emperor said: "You know one part but not the other. In planning strategies within the tent to secure victory a thousand *li* away, I am not the equal of Zifang. In stabilizing the state, comforting the people, ensuring provisions, and keeping supply lines unbroken, I am not the equal of Xiao He. In commanding a million troops, ensuring victory in battle and conquest in attack, I am not the equal of Han Xin. These three are all outstanding men, and I was able to employ them—this is how I gained the realm. Xiang Yu had Fan Zeng but could not use him—this is how he was captured by me."

The record states: Master Cheng said: "The constancy of heaven and earth lies in their mind pervading all things yet being without mind. The constancy of the sage lies in their emotions aligning with all things yet being without emotion. Yet it is not that they are truly without mind—it is that the mind of one becomes the mind of ten thousand, so what person cannot be embraced? Nor is it that they are truly without emotion—it is that the emotion of one becomes the emotion of ten thousand, so what thing cannot be employed? Though the High Ancestor of Han did not closely approach the sages, his efficacy in that moment was such that heaven was made clear and earth was made tranquil by it. Had he not been magnanimous and broad-minded, receptive to good counsel like flowing water, and aligned with the vast openness of the Grand Duke, responding to things as they came, how could he have attended to every matter and discerned every person?

If one harms others in the name of wisdom yet fails to unite the hearts of the multitude, or if one insists on one’s own virtue yet fails to harmonize with the aspirations of all, this is what heaven abandons—not merely what men capture.

After Empress Lü passed, Lü Lu and Lü Chan plotted rebellion but feared the Marquis of Jiang and the Lord of ZhuXu, hesitating without resolve. The Marquis of Jiang sent Li Qi to deceive Lü Lu into relinquishing command of his troops to the Grand Marshal. The Grand Marshal entered the military gate and issued an order: "Bare your right shoulder for the Lü clan, bare your left for the Liu clan." The entire army bared their left shoulders. The Grand Marshal then led the Northern Army, dividing his forces to arrest all the Lü men and women, young and old alike, and executed them without exception.

The record states: Some say the Grand Marshal’s question was improper, some fearing for him, others considering him fortunate. Yet if we rely solely on the words recorded on paper, [the Grand Marshal must have first secured his position before issuing the order]. [As the saying goes]: From Li Qi’s deceptive persuasion, we can infer the truth. When Chen She, a mere commoner, was about to rise, he still had men cry out in the groves of the village shrine, "Chen She shall be king!" before the people followed him. How much more so for the wisdom of Chen Ping and Zhou Bo, who relied only on the Six Armies! Moreover, if they dared not openly declare the need to punish the Lü clan, how would the people know the direction of loyalty and rebellion? With a single question about baring shoulders, the distinction between rebellion and loyalty became clear—this is evident. Only then did all know that the Lü clan deserved execution and the Liu clan deserved to be restored. The Lü clan’s supporters, front and back, left and right, dissolved in disarray. Was this not the result of deep and interlocking calculations?

When Emperor Wen ascended the throne, he became increasingly familiar with the affairs of state. At court, he asked the Right Chancellor Bo: "How many cases are adjudicated in the realm in a year?" Bo pleaded ignorance. The Emperor then asked: "How much money and grain enter and leave the treasury in a year?"

Bo again pleaded ignorance, his sweat soaking his back. The Emperor then asked the Left Chancellor Ping, who replied: "There are officials in charge of such matters. If Your Majesty inquires about adjudicated cases, hold the Minister of Justice accountable; if about money and grain, hold the Minister of Revenue accountable." The Emperor said: "Then what affairs does the Chancellor oversee?" Ping replied: "The Chancellor assists the Son of Heaven above in harmonizing yin and yang, aligning with the four seasons, and below in nurturing the proper growth of all things. Externally, he pacifies the four barbarians and the feudal lords; internally, he draws close to the common people, ensuring that the high ministers and great officers each fulfill their duties." The Emperor praised his answer. Thereupon, the Marquis of Jiang realized his wisdom and ability were inferior to Ping’s, so he resigned on grounds of illness and requested to return the Chancellor’s seal. The Emperor granted his request, and Ping served as sole Chancellor.

It is recorded: Ping’s words truly embodied the Chancellor’s duty. The Emperor already understood this—could he not then demand its fulfillment? In demanding its fulfillment, could he not also seek the right person for the task? Alas, the Emperor’s keen wisdom did not extend to this. I have once pondered the reason. Emperor Gaozong reverently observed silence to contemplate the Dao, and what he pursued was learning. Through learning, he knew that understanding was not difficult, but practice was—this was to seek what benefits attainment. Emperor Wen, in profound silence, transformed the people, and what he admired was Laozi. Laozi taught knowing the masculine yet embracing the feminine, knowing the white yet guarding the black—this was to seek what brings no benefit to attainment. Thus, when martial generals and village officials—men of bluster and bravado—are governed by a ruler of pure virtue, their conduct and demeanor instead bow to his authority and look up to his radiance. How could one demand that they sit and discourse on the Dao? Yet all possess a single virtue, and those who aspire to emulate the Three Kings do not do so to display difference. Without such ability, one cannot assist the Son of Heaven in rectifying the Central Kingdom and pacifying the four barbarians.

Chen Ping had once followed in military campaigns, devising six extraordinary strategies: first, proposing to distribute gold to sow discord among the enemy; second, presenting a crude letter to deceive the Chu envoy; third, sending out two thousand women by night to break the siege at Zhongyang...

Seizing the opportunity to request the enfeoffment of Han Xin as King of Qi was the fourth; proposing a feigned excursion to Yunmeng to capture Han Xin was the fifth; and breaking the siege at Bailang was the sixth.

Recorded thus: To turn peril into victory and devise extraordinary strategies by assessing the enemy are matters of the moment—what is called the cunning of a single general, and in this he was more than sufficient. Yet to extend Heaven’s benevolence and harmonize yin and yang are affairs of an age—what is called the talent of a ruler of ten thousand chariots, and in this he fell short. Such was the Emperor’s judgment of his chancellor: a name without substance.

As the imperial carriage passed the office of the Gentlemen of the Palace, the Emperor asked Feng Tang, “Where is your father’s family from?” Tang replied, “My grandfather was from Zhao.” The Emperor said, “Once someone spoke to me of the worth of the Zhao general Li Qi, who fought beneath Julu. Now, whenever I adorn my thoughts, I cannot but dwell upon Julu.” Tang said, “Yet he was not even comparable to the generals Li Mu and Lian Po.” The Emperor struck the railing and sighed, “Alas! If only I could have Li Mu or Lian Po as my general, what worry would I have of the Xiongnu?” Tang said, “Though Your Majesty might obtain men like Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to employ them.” The Emperor angrily rebuked Tang, who replied: “In ancient times, when the Son of Heaven sent forth a general, he would kneel and push forward the chariot hub, saying, ‘Within the gates, I command; beyond the gates, the general commands.’ Military merit, ranks, and rewards were all decided by the general in the field. Thus they were able to pursue the Xiongnu chanyu, shatter the Eastern Hu, destroy the Danlin, curb the might of Qin in the west, and prop up Han and Wei in the south. Now Wei Shang serves as governor of Yunzhong, and he devotes all the taxes from the military market to feasting his soldiers. The Xiongnu keep their distance and dare not approach the frontier. Once, when the barbarians made a single incursion, Shang led his chariots and cavalry to strike them, inflicting heavy casualties. Yet when he reported his victory, the headquarters staff found a single discrepancy in his account, and the scribes bound him by the law. Your Majesty’s rewards are too meager and your punishments too severe: though Shang was only six enemy heads short of his tally, he was handed over to the officials and stripped of his rank. From this it is clear that even if you had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to employ them.” The Emperor was pleased and ordered Tang to take the imperial tally and pardon Wei Shang, restoring him as governor of Yunzhong and appointing Tang as Commander of the Chariots and Cavalry.

Recorded thus: When the Emperor longed for Lian Po and Li Mu as generals, why did he not also long for the Duke of Zhou and the Duke of Shao as his chancellors? As generals, Lian Po and Li Mu pursued the chanyu, shattered the Eastern Hu, and annihilated the Danlin—nothing more than keeping the Xiongnu from approaching the frontier. But as chancellors, the Duke of Zhou and the Duke of Shao brought the Yuechang people to present tribute through repeated interpreters, saying, “For three years now, Heaven has sent no violent winds or excessive rains, and the seas have not stirred with waves. We suspect there must be a sage in the Central Kingdom—why not go and pay homage?” Then which was greater: the merit of generals or chancellors? The limbs and joints are but ministers; good ministers are the sages. The Three Dynasties brought the four barbarians to submit by this Dao. Emperor Wen did not seek out the supreme sage to join forces with him, but instead fixated on what he had heard of Zhao and Dai. Though he daily struck his thigh in regret, what benefit did it bring? This is why, though he heard Chen Ping’s words, they were no different from Feng Tang’s argument—neither sufficed for great wisdom.

During Emperor Wu’s reign, Ji An was often ill, and Zhuang Zhu requested leave on his behalf. The Emperor asked, “What sort of man is Ji An?” Zhu replied, “If Ji An were to hold office, he would have no advantage over others. But when assisting a young ruler and safeguarding an established legacy, he is deeply steadfast: summoned, he does not come; dismissed, he does not leave. Even if Meng Ben and Xia Yu were to oppose him, they could not dislodge him.” The Emperor said, “Indeed. Of old there were ministers of the altars of soil and grain—Ji An comes close to that.” Recorded thus: This was why, when Emperor Wu later entrusted his orphaned heir, he alone found the right man. Only when one truly knows a man can one employ him with full commitment—how much more so for those as foolish as Xiao He or as stubborn as Wang Ling! Without true knowledge, who could achieve success? Those who are neither foolish nor stubborn avoid harm and chase profit, and what need would there be to summon them to come or dismiss them to go?

Emperor Taizong of Tang only failed to truly know Xiao He and Li Ji, and so when entrusting his heir, he relied on their talent and intelligence while overlooking their moral integrity. Yet men like Hongshi, Ni Kuan, and Zhuang Zhu had long been fostered and employed. What did they have to do with the altars of soil and grain?

Lady Gouyi’s son, Fuling, was but a few years old, yet his frame was sturdy and tall, and he possessed great intelligence. The Emperor marveled at and cherished him, and upon observing that among his ministers only the Palace Attendant and Chariot Master Huo Guang was loyal and steadfast enough to entrust with great affairs, he had the eunuchs present Huo with the *Illustrated Scroll of the Duke of Zhou Assisting King Cheng in Receiving the Feudal Lords*. When the Emperor’s illness grew severe, Huo Guang wept and asked, “If the unmentionable should come to pass, who ought to succeed?” The Emperor replied, “Have you not yet understood my earlier intent? Establish the youngest son, and you shall act as the Duke of Zhou did.” On the day *yichou*, an edict was issued to appoint Fuling as Crown Prince, with Huo Guang as Grand Marshal and Grand General.

Huo Guang had entered and exited the palace’s inner chambers for over twenty years, ever cautious and meticulous, never once erring. His demeanor was composed and deliberate; each time he passed through the palace gates, his steps and pauses were measured with precision. The Gentleman of the Palace and the Captain of the Guard secretly observed him, never finding his conduct off by even a fraction.

Recorded thus: The Emperor’s appointment of Huo Guang was likely informed by Zhuang Zhu’s assessment of Ji An, revealing his discernment in knowing men. To entrust a six-foot orphan to another requires recognizing Huo Guang’s loyalty, steadfastness, and meticulousness—qualities as sharp as a blade. Had there been no usurpation of Liu He or the authority to establish Emperor Xuan, would Huo Guang not have been a man of perfect integrity? If Ji An had lived in those times and faced such events, I know he could not have tolerated others’ faults—how then could he have endured his own? The affairs of Chao Cuo and the abdication of Emperor Wen were his forte. Yet when it came to the later conspiracy of the Prince of Huainan, even his own wife and children could not restrain his desires. The Emperor had reason to trust Huo Guang, but Huo Guang failed to live up to the Emperor’s expectations—this was another failing of Ji An.

The daughter of Huo Guang’s granddaughter, the child of Shangguan An, was his own great-granddaughter. Shangguan An, seeking to make her Empress through Huo Guang’s influence, was refused on account of her youth. He then turned to the Emperor’s elder sister, Grand Princess Gai, who had her enter the palace. She was made Empress at the tender age of six. Thereupon, Shangguan Jie and Shangguan An grew deeply resentful of Huo Guang. Learning that Prince Dan of Yan, the Emperor’s elder brother, harbored resentment for not being named heir, they had someone forge a letter in the Prince’s name, proposing to jointly seize and depose Huo Guang. When the memorial was submitted, Huo Guang, upon hearing of it, did not enter the palace. The Emperor asked, “Where is the Grand General?” Shangguan Jie replied that the Prince had accused him of crimes, so he dared not enter. An edict was issued summoning the Grand General, and Huo Guang entered, removed his cap, and kowtowed. The Emperor said, “Put on your cap, General. I know this letter is forged. You were only recently appointed to oversee the Colonels—how could the Prince have known of it in less than ten days?” At the time, the Emperor was but fourteen years old. The officials and attendants of the Imperial Secretariat were all astonished, and the forger of the memorial was indeed found to have fled. Thereafter, when members of Shangguan Jie’s faction slandered Huo Guang, the Emperor would grow angry, saying, “The Grand General is a loyal minister, entrusted by the late Emperor to assist me. Those who defame him shall be punished.” From then on, Shangguan Jie and his associates dared not speak against him.

Recorded thus: It is commonly said that the wise do not live long—yet is it not also true that the long-lived are not wise? What one receives from Heaven may be abundant and pure, or pure yet meager. From clarity arises sincerity—this is called “nature”; from sincerity arises clarity—this is called “teaching.” Sincerity is clarity, and clarity is sincerity. Those who possess abundance and purity endure without limit. Glass is a treasure, no less lustrous and white; ice and jade are vessels, no less radiant and bright. Yet they possess purity but meagerness, and so shatter at the slightest touch. Though their clarity may be the same, their sincerity differs—this is why Emperor Zhao of Han was limited to such an extent.

Since Emperor Wu established the offices of the Left Fengyi, Right Fufeng, and Metropolitan Governor of the Capital, among officials and commoners, only Zhao Guanghan was universally esteemed. By nature astute and perceptive, he excelled in his duties as an official, particularly skilled in the technique of *gouju* for uncovering the truth. *Gouju* works thus: if one wishes to know the price of a horse, one first asks about dogs, then sheep, then oxen, before finally inquiring about horses. By cross-referencing their prices and comparing them by category, the true value of the horse is revealed without error. Only Zhao Guanghan was so precise that he could employ this method—others who imitated him could not match his skill. The bandits, rogues, and local toughs of the commandery, along with the locations of their dens and hideouts, as well as the bribes and illicit gains taken by officials—all were known to him. Several young men of Chang’an gathered in an abandoned house in a poor quarter to plot a robbery. Before their discussion was even finished, Zhao Guanghan dispatched officers to arrest them, and they confessed in full. When the wealthy man Su Hui, a Gentleman of the Palace, was abducted by two men, Zhao Guanghan led his officers to the house. Standing in the courtyard, he had the Prefect of Chang’an, Gong She, knock on the door and address the bandits: “The Metropolitan Governor, Lord Zhao, apologizes to the two gentlemen. Do not kill your hostage—he is a servant of the imperial guard.” The two men were stunned.

Once, Zhao Guanghan summoned the warden of Hudu Pavilion. As the man traveled west to the border, the warden at the frontier post jested, “When you reach the prefectural office, give my regards to Lord Zhao.” After the warden arrived and Zhao spoke with him, concluding their business, Zhao said, “The warden at the frontier post sent word to thank me—why did you not convey his greeting?” The warden kowtowed and admitted it was true. Zhao then said, “When you return, thank the frontier warden for me. Encourage him to diligently attend to his duties and prove his worth, and the Metropolitan Governor will not forget his kindness.” His ability to uncover hidden crimes and expose the guilty was as uncanny as this.

**Recorded Note:** I have heard from the former worthies that benevolence may be excessive, but wisdom must not be. The custom of exposing others’ faults and the art of probing secrets—these are excesses of wisdom. Such excesses cannot be called “seeking counsel and acting with moderation,” nor “concealing evil and extolling good.” Moreover, when combined with harshness, overbearing strength, and a reckless spirit that stirs trouble like the wind, this is precisely the path to self-destruction—not what is meant by “wisdom like a god.”

**From *The Book of Later Han*:**
When Dou Rong heard of Emperor Guangwu’s might and virtue, he wished to submit, but the distance of Hexi made direct communication difficult. Yin Xao sent the eloquent scholar Zhang Xuan to persuade Rong, saying, “Gengshi’s cause has already succeeded, only to perish soon after. The destruction of this one clan is a lesson that will not repeat. Each of you should secure your territory and ally with Long and Shu in a vertical alliance. At best, you could become the Six States; at worst, you would not fall below Wei Tuo’s rank.” Rong summoned the local elites to discuss the matter. Among them, those with discernment said, “Now the emperor’s name and surname appear in the prophetic texts. The Han has received the mandate anew.” Rong then resolved to submit and dispatched his chief clerk, Liu Xun, to present a letter at Zhuoyang.

The emperor replied to Rong: “Now Gongsun Ziyang holds Yizhou, and General Yin commands Tianshui. As Shu and Han attack each other, the balance of power rests with you. A single step to either side will tip the scales. Given this, if you wish to deepen our bond, how could there be limits? If you intend to establish yourself like Duke Huan or Duke Wen, aiding a weak state, you must strive to complete your achievements. If you aim to divide the realm into three, forming alliances and coalitions, you should decide this without delay. The world is not yet unified, and you and I are separated by vast distances—not nations that would devour each other. Those who advise you now must be following Ren Ao’s plan to have Wei Tuo control the seven commanderies. A true king grants land but not people; each should attend to his own affairs.” He then appointed Rong as Governor of Liangzhou. When the imperial seal and edict reached Hexi, the entire region was astonished, believing the Son of Heaven could see beyond a thousand *li*.

**Recorded Note:** Dou Rong’s submission was a turning from darkness toward light. The emperor’s foresight in discerning affairs was often accurate. Only with Rong’s clarity could the emperor’s vision be realized.

The *Tun* hexagram’s first nine says: *“Lingering, it is favorable to abide in constancy.”* Dou Rong embodied this. The *Image* states: *“Heaven’s creation is in the midst of chaos; it is fitting to establish lords, yet not to rest.”* Emperor Guangwu embodied this. This is why, to the end of the Han era, his illustrious reputation knew no bounds.

That reckless Ren Xiao—just as the saying goes: *"Mounting a horse in disarray, weeping blood in streams"*—was destroyed before he could even turn his heel. Yet this was not merely the emperor’s foresight spanning a thousand *li*; the sage had already made it plain for ten thousand generations.

Emperor Guangwu, observing that the registered acreage of cultivated land across the realm was largely fraudulent, and that household records and annual registers showed discrepancies in gains and losses, issued an edict ordering the provinces and commanderies to conduct a thorough land survey. Thereupon, many inspectors and governors resorted to cunning pretexts, using the land-measurement campaign as an excuse to assemble the people in the fields, where they proceeded to measure not only the land but also their homes and village compounds. The people wailed in protest along the roads, while the powerful and wealthy were often favored, and the poor and vulnerable were exploited and oppressed.

At the time, each commandery had dispatched envoys to present memorials at court. The emperor noticed that a document carried by an official from Chenliu bore writing on its back. Upon examining it, he read: *"Yingchuan and Hongnong may be investigated, but Henan and Nanyang must not be questioned."* When the emperor interrogated the official, the man refused to admit anything, claiming he had found the document on Changshou Street. The emperor grew furious.

Just then, the emperor’s son, Prince Yang of Donghai, aged twelve, who had been standing behind the screen, spoke up: *"The official was acting under his commandery’s orders, intending only to compare land measurements."* The emperor asked: *"If that is so, why did he say Henan and Nanyang must not be questioned?"* The prince replied: *"Henan is the imperial capital, where many close ministers reside, and Nanyang is the emperor’s hometown, where many close relatives live. Their landholdings and estates exceed regulations and cannot serve as a standard."* The emperor ordered the imperial guards to question the official further, and the man finally confessed, confirming Prince Yang’s account. From that moment, the emperor’s admiration and affection for Yang only deepened.

**Recorded Note:** Is not such discernment the sagely virtue of a sovereign?

Yet there exists a meticulous clarity and a scrutinizing clarity. The former is the fullness of illumination—thus, when the great light hangs in the sky, it bathes all directions equally, yet never troubles itself with the faintest glimmer in the cracks or the faintest shadow beneath an overturned basin. The latter is the severity of illumination—thus, when a rhinoceros-horn torch lights the riverbank, every detail stands exposed, yet the tiniest fish in the depths or the most hidden subtlety may still elude its grasp.

Though the torch is a thing, illumination itself is no thing: it may shine upon the riverbank, yet when turned toward the sun, it casts no light at all. This explains why the Han emperor Ming could discern the truth in the case of the clerk’s kneecap, yet remained blind to the excesses of the Chu trials.

When Emperor Guangwu was in Ji, Wang Lang rose in rebellion and issued proclamations to frame him. The emperor ordered Wang Ba to recruit men in the marketplace, intending to strike at Lang, and hastened to depart. The day was bitterly cold; as they galloped south to Xiaquyang, word came that Wang Lang’s troops were approaching from behind, and all in the retinue grew fearful. Upon reaching the Hutuo River, a scout returned to report: *"The river flows swiftly, and with no boats, we cannot cross."* The officials were seized with dread.

Guangwu sent Ba to assess the situation. Fearing he would alarm the others, Ba feigned an attempt to block the water’s advance, then returned and knelt, saying: *"The ice is solid—we can cross."* The officials rejoiced. Guangwu smiled: *"The scout was indeed lying."* They pressed forward to the river, where the ice had indeed frozen over. He ordered Ba to oversee the crossing. Before even a handful of riders had passed, the ice began to break. Turning to Ba, he said: *"That our company crossed safely is thanks to you."* Ba demurred: *"This is the supreme virtue of Your Highness, the blessing of divine spirits. Even King Wu’s omen of the white fish cannot compare."*

Later, he told his officials: *"Ba’s timely measure to meet the crisis was like a heavenly sign."* The Record notes: *"This should be likened to the white serpent, not the white fish—only then would the divine blessing be fittingly matched."*

It further states: *"What is meant by ‘timely measure to meet the crisis’ is no deceptive path. When affairs reach the brink of peril, with not a hair’s breadth to spare, that is the moment for heroes to employ their wisdom. Had we followed the scout’s report, would we have advanced to block the water? Before Li Ling, the barbarians dared not press; after Zhao Yun, one man held a thousand hearts—all achieved thus. To claim foreknowledge of the ice’s freezing as a celestial omen would be beyond Ba’s reach."*

*Hongdao Record, Scroll 38 (concluded)*
*Hongdao Record, Scroll 39: Wisdom*

**The Wisdom of Ruler and Minister**

From *The Records of the Three Kingdoms*: Zhuge Liang of Langye resided in seclusion at Longzhong in Xiangyang, tilling his fields with his own hands. He was fond of singing the *Liangfu* hymns and often compared himself to Guan Zhong and Yue Yi, though none of his contemporaries acknowledged this. Sima Hui, a man of refined elegance and keen judgment, shared his hometown with Pang Degong, who was widely respected. Degong once remarked, "Kongming is the Crouching Dragon; Decao is the Ice Mirror." Thus, when Liu Bei was in Jingzhou, he sought out scholars from Sima Hui. Hui said, "Scholars and common men—how could they recognize the demands of the times? Those who know the times are the outstanding and heroic. Among them are the Hidden Dragon and the Young Phoenix." When Bei asked who they were, Hui replied, "Zhuge Kongming."

The *Record* states: Observing Zhuge Kongming, I realize that the talents nurtured in the Eastern Capital cannot be easily obtained. People merely see the humiliation of the partisans and deem it the calamity of the virtuous and worthy, unaware that the purge of the corrupt and the rise of the outstanding foster the winds of pure virtue. Kongming knew how to cultivate himself in stillness and nurture his virtue through frugality. Without detachment, one cannot clarify one’s aspirations; without tranquility, one cannot attain far-reaching goals—was he not a dragon in virtue, though hidden? He also said: "Learning requires stillness; talent requires study. Without study, one cannot broaden one’s talents; without stillness, one cannot complete one’s learning—is this not the unceasing diligence of the *Qian* hexagram?" And again: "Indolence and arrogance prevent deep inquiry; impatience and rashness prevent sound governance. As years race by and intentions fade with time, is this not the vigilance of one who trembles even at dusk?" Thus, he was called the "Outer Dragon"—rightly so.

Yet the three visits in earnest revived the long-suppressed spirit of the age, and his grasp of the times was truly the most celebrated praise. Bei visited Liang and, dismissing his attendants, said: "The Han house is collapsing; treacherous ministers usurp its mandate, and the sovereign is humbled in the dust. Though I lack virtue and strength, I wish to uphold righteousness in the realm. But my wisdom and strategy are shallow, and I have faltered to this day—yet my resolve remains unshaken. What plan should I adopt?" Liang replied: "Since Dong Zhuo’s time, heroes have risen in great numbers, seizing provinces and commanderies beyond count. Compared to Yuan Shao, Cao Cao was weaker and fewer in number, yet he overcame Shao and turned weakness into strength—not only by heaven’s timing but also by human strategy. Now Cao commands a million troops and wields the Son of Heaven to command the lords—truly, none can contend with him. Sun Quan holds the lands east of the Yangtze, having ruled for three generations. His state is secure, his people loyal, and the worthy and able serve him—he can be an ally but not a target. Jingzhou, north of the Han and Mian rivers, commands the resources of the southern seas, connects eastward to Wu and Kuaiji, and westward to Ba and Shu—this is a land for martial exploits, yet its lord cannot hold it. This is likely heaven’s gift to you, General—do you have the will to take it? Yizhou is a land of perilous passes and fertile fields, a natural stronghold where Gaozu built his imperial enterprise. Liu Zhang is weak and ignorant; Zhang Lu lies to the north. The people are prosperous, the state is rich, yet they lack care—thus the wise and able yearn for a worthy ruler. You, General, are of imperial lineage, your integrity renowned throughout the realm. You gather heroes and thirst for the worthy. If you seize Jing and Yi, secure their strategic defenses, make peace with the Rong tribes to the west, pacify the Yi and Yue to the south, ally with Sun Quan externally, and govern justly within—when the realm changes, you may dispatch a great general with Jingzhou’s troops to advance toward Wan and Luo, while you personally lead Yizhou’s forces into the Qin plains. Who would not welcome you with baskets of food and pots of drink? If so, hegemony can be achieved, and the Han restored."

Xuande said, "Excellent."

The *Record* states: Observing Kongming’s counsel to Xuande—seizing and holding Bashu, reclaiming the Three Qins, and seizing the realm—it was all one vision. Yet why could he not restore the imperial enterprise? In Gaozu’s time, the Three Heroes were employed together. Capturing Wei, subduing Dai, overthrowing Zhao, Yan, and Qi, and destroying Chu in the south—all were Xin’s achievements. Consider his words: "The more, the better"—how different from the slaying of Yan Liang and Wen Chou! The one who sets the course and points the way is this man; the one who hunts rabbits and foxes is also this man—how can the world bear both at once? Moreover, Cao’s use of troops resembled Sun and Wu, yet the petty state of Shu ultimately perished in obscurity. Who could have been its mighty arm? Though Kongming outmaneuvered Sima Yi, it may have been too late. Thus Gaozu sighed: "You know one thing but not the other."

Sun Quan said to Lü Meng: "Now that you hold power, you cannot neglect learning." Meng excused himself, citing military duties. Quan replied: "Do I wish you to become a scholar-official? Simply read broadly to understand past affairs. You say you are busy—who is busier than I? Yet I have read, and it has greatly benefited me." Meng then began his studies. Later, when Lu Su passed through Xunyang and discussed matters with Meng, he was astonished: "Your talent and strategy now surpass the old Lü Meng of Wu!" Meng replied: "A scholar, after three days apart, must be viewed with fresh eyes. Why are you so slow to see this?"

The *Record* states: What was the purpose of learning in ancient times? Fine qualities are easily found, but the supreme Way is rarely heard. Learning was for sincerity and trust. What is the purpose of learning today? To seek success in affairs and achievement in deeds—learning has become a tool for deceit and fraud. Thus, before Sun Quan’s exhortation, Lü Meng’s innate goodness was unrefined, and heavenly principle remained intact—how could he have earned such admiration? After his studies, he relied on cunning and calculation, displaying his abilities and scheming for success—no longer the old Lü Meng of Wu.

Yet if this were not Lü Meng’s gain, would it not be Guan Yu’s loss? When Sun Quan discussed Zhou Yu, Lu Su, and Lü Meng with Lu Xun, he said: "Gongjin was fierce and heroic, his courage and strategy surpassing others. He crushed Cao Mengde and opened up Jingzhou—truly peerless. Zijing, through Gongjin’s recommendation, came to me. At our first banquet, our conversation soon turned to grand strategy and the enterprise of emperors and kings—this was one joy. Later, when Mengde seized Liu Zong’s momentum and boasted of leading hundreds of thousands by both land and water, I consulted my generals for advice. None spoke first, until Zhang Zibu suggested sending envoys to welcome him. Zijing urged me to summon Gongjin at once, entrust him with troops, and strike in reverse—this was another joy. Though he later advised me to lend territory to Xuande, this was his one flaw, insufficient to overshadow his two strengths. Thus, I have always compared him to Deng Yu.

As for Ziming, in his youth I thought him incapable of handling strenuous tasks, possessing only boldness and courage. But as he matured, his studies flourished, and his strategic brilliance emerged, placing him second only to Gongjin. His capture of Guan Yu surpassed even Zijing’s achievements."

The *Record* states: How unreasonable is Sun Quan’s assessment! Gongjin’s success at Red Cliffs was spurred by the Shu sovereign and his ministers. Instead of gratitude, he met with mockery—how could he not have struck back? To invite an enemy and not seize the chance, then lend them territory, and call the lender flawed—what of the borrower? Sun Quan’s treachery as a Han usurper is extreme. His cunning in ambushing Guan Yu was no better than a thief’s stealth. To claim superiority over Zijing and equate such deeds with petty thievery is still tolerable—what wonder that he flattered the deceitful usurper with talk of Heaven’s mandate?

The *Book of Jin* records: Du Yu, though the realm was at peace, held that forgetting war invites peril. He diligently trained troops, constructed floating palaces, and won the devotion of the Jiang and Han regions, his influence spreading for ten thousand *li*. He crushed the mountain tribes, established garrisons, and secured strategic positions to strengthen the state’s defenses. He also restored the legacy of Zhao Xinchen, dredging and channeling waters to irrigate over ten thousand *qing* of fields. He demarcated boundaries with stone markers, ensuring shared benefit for public and private alike. The people relied on him, calling him "Father Du." Formerly, the waterways only linked the Mian and Han to Jiangling, with no northern passage for over a thousand *li*. The confluence of Lake Baju with the Yuan and Xiang rivers, surrounded by mountains, was a natural stronghold on which the Jing and Man peoples depended. Du Yu then opened Yangkou, dredged the Xia River, and extended the route to Baling for over a thousand *li*, draining the Yangtze’s excess inward while connecting the grain transport of Ling and Gui outward. The southern lands sang of him: *"No rebellion in later ages—who but Father Du discerned wisdom and valor?"*

The *Record* states: Who does not admire wisdom and valor? Yet who truly understands them? The *Book of Documents* says: *"Possessing goodness, one loses it; boasting of one’s name, one loses its merit."* People’s wisdom is shallow and narrow, so they fail to grasp this. In the campaign to pacify Wu, the planning, decision-making, and strategic direction all came from Du Yu. The other generals merely hunted beasts. Thus, though he never mounted a horse or shot through armor, this was not due to aristocratic indolence but because his broad learning and deep immersion in the classics led him to greater heights. He neither boasted of his virtues nor flaunted his merits. Yet his admonition to *"never forget peril in times of peace"* surpasses common insight—how could mere dredging or military skill compare? Even the cunning of Hua and Gui could not match him. How could one not strive to diminish complacency and uphold the foundation of deeds and words? Alas, he is worthy of emulation.

From *The Old Book of Tang*: Emperor Taizong said to Xiao Yu, "In my youth, I was fond of bows and arrows. I acquired over a thousand fine bows and believed none could surpass them. Recently, I showed them to a bowyer, who declared, 'None are made of good wood.' When I asked why, he replied, 'If the heart of the wood is not straight, its grain will be askew. Though the bow may be strong, the arrow will not fly true.' Only then did I realize my earlier judgment had been unrefined. If I, who subdued the realm with bow and arrow, could not fully discern their quality, how can I presume to grasp every matter under Heaven?"

Thereupon, he ordered officials of the fifth rank and above to take turns lodging in the Secretariat and Chancellery, frequently summoning them to inquire about the people’s hardships and the successes and failures of governance.

A record notes: "In ancient times, artisans used their craft to admonish rulers—this is what the bowyer and Wheelwright Pian meant. Even today, their words are still praised, for they exhaustively revealed the principles of things, demanding careful consideration. Thus, if the heart of the wood is crooked, its grain will be askew; if the ruler’s heart is not upright, governance will be perfunctory. The bowyer’s insight may well surpass that of ministers like Wei Zheng. Yet Taizong merely grasped the words but not their deeper meaning. He could inquire into the origins of hardship and failure but failed to exercise caution in matters concerning his wife and kin—was this truly the balanced practice of seeking counsel?"

The emperor asked Wei Zheng, "How does a ruler attain clarity, and how does he fall into darkness?" Wei replied, "Clarity comes from listening widely; darkness, from trusting one-sidedly. Yao sought the voices of the people below, so the crimes of the Three Miao could reach his ears. Shun’s four eyes saw clearly, his four ears heard all, so Gong, Gun, Huan Dou, and the others could not deceive him. The Second Emperor trusted Zhao Gao alone, bringing the disaster of Wangyi Palace. Emperor Wu of Liang trusted Zhu Yi alone, inviting the humiliation of Taicheng. Emperor Yang of Sui trusted Yu Shiji alone, leading to the mutiny at Pengcheng Pavilion. Thus, when a ruler listens broadly and accepts counsel, powerful ministers cannot block the truth, and the sentiments of the people rise to him."

The emperor said, "Well said."

A record notes: "In the *Yi Jing*, the hexagram *Li* represents brightness, for its two luminous lines shine forth, symbolizing civil brilliance. The hexagram *Ming Yi* represents obscurity, for its light enters the earth, symbolizing hidden darkness. This is the division between broad listening and one-sided trust. Even with such lessons, later rulers still trusted Yang Guozhong, bringing the catastrophe of the Tianbao era."

He trusted Lu Qi, bringing the chaos of the Jianzhong era; he trusted Li Xun and Zheng Zhu, leading to the Ganlu Incident.

The emperor asked Fang Xuanling and Xiao Li, "What kind of ruler was Emperor Wen of Sui?"

They replied, "Emperor Wen was diligent in governance. Whenever he held court, he might remain until sunset. He would seat officials of the fifth rank and above to discuss matters, eating only when his guards brought him meals. Though his nature was not benevolent, he was indeed an emperor who exerted himself to the utmost."

The emperor said, "You have grasped one aspect but not the other. Emperor Wen was unenlightened yet fond of scrutiny. Being unenlightened, his perception was incomplete; being fond of scrutiny, he grew suspicious of all things, both of which stemmed from his failure to trust his ministers. The realm is vast, and the affairs of a single day are myriad. Even if he wearied his spirit and exhausted his body, how could he ensure every decision was sound? Once his ministers understood his intent, they merely followed his decrees and accepted his judgments. Even if they erred, none dared to remonstrate. This is why the dynasty fell after two generations.

I act differently. I select the realm’s worthiest talents and appoint them to office, entrusting them to deliberate on the empire’s affairs. After the chief ministers have thoroughly examined and settled matters, they report to me. Those who render merit are rewarded; those who commit faults are punished. Who would dare not exert their utmost to fulfill their duties? What cause is there to fear the realm will not be well governed?"

Thereupon, he instructed all offices: "From now on, if any edicts or decrees issued are deemed unsuitable, all must memorialize their objections. None shall comply out of deference without fully expressing their views."

A record notes: The emperor’s words serve as a mirror for rulers. To be unenlightened yet fond of scrutiny is a common flaw of later ages. Right and wrong cannot be obscured by one man’s judgment, yet if one relies solely on personal approval, right and wrong become confused. Good and evil cannot be ranked by one man’s standards, yet if one indulges personal preferences, good and evil grow muddled. Merit and fault cannot be decided by one man’s decree, yet if one acts out of private bias, merit and fault become indistinguishable.

Thus, while one may defer to others due to lack of enlightenment, it is still defensible; but to take on petty details oneself while constantly doubting others is indefensible. The realm is vast, yet the mind’s capacity is small; the people are boundless, yet one’s ears and eyes are limited. If one allows all offices to memorialize objections when inconvenienced, one avoids the burden of partiality; if one can select the worthy and employ the capable, there is no fear of neglected affairs. This is why the governance of the Zhenguan era may be deemed exemplary. Let later rulers take heed.

Fang Xuanling was astute in administrative matters and refined in letters. Day and night, he devoted himself wholeheartedly, fearing even a single thing might be misplaced. He applied the law with leniency and fairness, hearing of another’s goodness as if it were his own. He did not demand perfection in others nor measure things by his own strengths. Together with [Du] Ruhui, he promoted men of talent, ever fearful of falling short. Even the regulations of the imperial secretariat were established by these two.

Whenever the emperor consulted Xuanling on affairs, he would say, "Without Ruhui, matters cannot be settled." Yet when Ruhui arrived, he invariably adopted Xuanling’s plans. For Xuanling excelled in strategy, while Ruhui excelled in decisiveness. The two complemented each other deeply, governing with a single heart. Thus, when the age speaks of worthy ministers, it extols Fang and Du.

A record notes: In my humble view, the Tang ministers Fang and Du differed from the Han’s Xiao [He] and Cao [Shen]. Their steps were not seen to follow, nor their ears to heed, yet history praises their strategic acumen. Why? They were adept at concealing their utility.

When comparing Tang Taizong to Han Gaozu, one sees a difference in their magnanimity and breadth of vision. Thus, with the emperor’s spirit so radiant and heroic that the world bowed before him, had men like Fang and Du proposed a single strategy, he would have claimed it as his own strength; had they devised a single plan, he would have boasted of it as his own achievement. How then could men like Xiao and Cao have maintained their standing to the end? Yet now, when the emperor consulted Xuanling on affairs, he would say, "Without Ruhui, matters cannot be settled." And when Ruhui arrived, he invariably adopted Xuanling’s plans. Was this not, between sovereign and minister, between friends, the art of concealing one’s utility?

The emperor said to Changsun Wuji and others, "Men suffer from not knowing their own faults. You may speak plainly of mine for me." They replied, "Your Majesty’s martial prowess and civil virtue leave us no choice but to follow and obey—what faults could there be to speak of?" The emperor said, "I ask you to point out my faults, yet you flatter me with empty praise. I wish to enumerate your strengths and weaknesses before you, that we may admonish and correct one another. What say you?" They all bowed and expressed their thanks.

The emperor said, "Changsun Wuji excels at avoiding suspicion, responds to matters with agility, and judges affairs with acuity—no ancient could surpass him—yet leading troops in battle is not his strength. Gao Shilian has read widely in ancient and modern texts, his mind is clear and far-reaching, and he does not waver in times of peril. In office, he is free of cliques, but lacks the backbone to offer forthright remonstrance. Tang Jian is eloquent and quick-witted, skilled at reconciling others. He has served me for thirty years yet never once offered advice on governance. Yang Shidao is pure and gentle in conduct, never erring or transgressing, but in truth he is timid and weak—of no use in times of crisis. Cen Wenben is sincere and steadfast, his writings rich and elegant, yet in debate he clings stubbornly to his views. Though he may plan for the long term, he does not betray his principles. Liu Ji is utterly steadfast, always acting for the common good, yet he still values private promises to friends. Ma Zhou perceives matters with swift clarity and is upright in character. When assessing others, he speaks with unvarnished honesty. I have employed him often, and he has seldom disappointed. Chu Suiliang’s learning is somewhat advanced, and his nature is firm and upright. He pours out his loyalty without reserve, drawing close to me like a bird alighting on a man’s shoulder—how could one not cherish him?"

A record notes: At first, the emperor sought to hear his own faults, then turned to those of his ministers. In the end, he enumerated the faults of his ministers while forgetting his own. Later, in his appraisal of Cao Cao, he said: "In peril, he could devise victory; in war, he could outmaneuver the enemy—his generalship was more than sufficient, but his capacity for rulership fell short." Alas! Taken together, this reveals the emperor’s gains and losses. Why then resort to empty flattery?

When Emperor Dezong ordered Guo Ziyi to return and appointed Li Guangbi in his stead, the soldiers wept and blocked the imperial envoy, begging to keep Ziyi. Ziyi deceived them, saying, "I am merely escorting the envoy; I have not yet departed." Then he spurred his horse and left. Guangbi rode with five hundred cavalry to the eastern capital, entering his headquarters by night. The commander of the army, Zhang Yongji, and other generals plotted to lead their elite troops into Luoyang, drive out Guangbi, and recall Ziyi. They ordered their men to arm themselves and mount their horses in readiness. Kang Yuanbao remonstrated, saying, "If you use force to summon the Duke, the court will surely suspect you. This is the Duke’s way of testing your loyalty—would you ruin his house for this? What have the Guo family’s hundred lives ever done to you, that you would act thus?" Yongji desisted.

A record notes: When Yue Fei of the Song was ordered to withdraw his troops, it was much like Duke Guo’s spur-of-the-moment departure. Yet some pedantic scholars criticize him, saying that when a general is in the field, even the emperor’s orders need not be obeyed, and that he should have waited until the Central Plains were recovered before complying. How is this different from Yongji’s scheme?

From *The History of the Song*: Though the Taizu Emperor had never studied in his youth, he took up reading in his later years. Yet his nature was magnanimous, and he did not affect refinement. When the new palace in the capital was completed, he sat in the main hall and ordered all the doors thrown open. They stood straight and unobstructed, revealing all within. He said to his attendants, "This is just like my heart—if there were the slightest crookedness, all would see it." He once said to his chief minister Xue Juzheng and others, "Few ancient rulers could govern their hearts and reach a state free of error. I have always risen early and retired late, guarding against wrongdoing and restraining desire, hoping to transform the people through virtue. When Tang Taizong received memorials from his ministers, they would openly criticize his faults, yet he showed no shame. How is it better to act thus than to refrain from error in the first place, sparing one’s ministers the need to speak?"

A record notes: *The Book of Yu* warns that "the human heart is perilous," not to indulge desire. *The Doctrine of the Mean* teaches vigilance in what is unseen and unheard. The emperor’s mind was as vast as the heavens—what room was there for doubt? That Tang Taizong could accept written remonstrance was still deemed shameful by later generations. Was this not a case of concealing one’s faults? No one since has matched him.

Taizong was diligent in his studies. After each court session, he would read until the hour of *shen* (3–5 p.m.) before setting his books aside. He ordered the Historiography Institute to compile *The Imperial Reader for a Peaceful Age* in one thousand volumes, presenting three volumes daily. Song Qi and others remonstrated, citing the labor involved. The emperor said, "Opening a book is always beneficial—it is no hardship. I intend to read this work in its entirety within the year."

A record notes: The learning of emperors differs from that of scholars. I believe scholars, too, should seek to understand human nature and pursue the essence of principle. To boast of vast knowledge or compete in ornate prose is merely laborious and of no benefit. As for Taizu’s engagement with the *Two Classics*, he not only read them but put them into practice—later generations would do well to follow his example. Yet the compilation of *The Imperial Reader for a Peaceful Age* was fragmented and disjointed, of no practical use. Though three volumes were presented daily, what benefit did it truly bring?

No doubt this explains why Tian Xi refused to accept it. Tian Xi was upright and unyielding, with few allies, yet shrewd and fond of ritual propriety. He once memorialized: "The existing *Imperial Reader* merely categorizes matters by type, offering no benefit to the sagely mind. Your servant requests leave to compile a new *Imperial Reader*." He further gathered essential passages from the classics and histories to create an *Imperial Screen*, placing it beside the imperial seat, so that the lessons of order and chaos, rise and fall, might always be before the emperor’s eyes.

The preface to his *Imperial Reader* states: "The Way of the sage is spread across the pages of books. The Six Classics speak in lofty terms with profound intent—without careful study and discussion, their depths cannot be fathomed. The various histories record disparate events—without comparing and synthesizing their differences, how can one easily grasp their complexity? The masters’ texts abound in heterodox doctrines; literary collections are sparse in words that uphold the classics. Without extracting their essential meanings to serve as warnings, distilling their guiding principles to perceive their coherence, and compiling a daily reader to cultivate daily-renewed virtue, even a lifetime would not suffice to exhaust them."

The preface to the *Imperial Screen* states: "The ancient emperors inscribed admonitions on their basins and goblets, their tables and staffs. For they saw them in their daily life and never forgot them, day or night. Your servant, whenever perusing the classics, histories, masters, and literary collections, selects their essential words and presents them for Your Majesty’s perusal. By observing and reflecting on them day and night, the sagely virtue will be renewed daily, rivaling that of Tang and Wu."

A record notes: "I observe that the founding emperors of the Han and Song dynasties never engaged in formal study, yet they did not lose the imperial standard. The rulers of the Tang and Song, though they toiled in broad learning, ultimately incurred the criticism of later generations. Why? Could it be that their pursuit of vast knowledge and strong memory did not closely align with the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge? Thus, their achievements were confined to literary refinement and calligraphy, without touching upon the sincerity of intention and rectification of the mind. Emperor Zhenzong merely sighed in admiration of Tian Xi, lamenting that heaven had taken him too soon, and failed to fully heed his memorials to reap the merit of forthright remonstrance. How much less could the placement of a single screen suffice? Even if a new *Imperial Reader* were compiled, it would be no different."

Zhao Pu, in his youth, was versed in official affairs but lacked scholarly learning. Emperor Taizu urged him to read, and thereafter he never let go of a book. Each time he returned to his private residence, he would open his cases, take out books, and read them through the night. When asked about this, he replied, "In governance, decisions flow like water." After his death, his family opened his cases and found *The Analects* in twenty chapters. He often told the emperor: "Your servant possesses a copy of *The Analects*—with half of it, I assisted Taizu in pacifying the realm; with the other half, I assist Your Majesty in achieving great peace."

Li Hang once read *The Analects*. When asked about it, he said: "As chief minister, even the words 'practice frugality and love the people, employ them at the proper seasons' from *The Analects* remain beyond my ability to fully enact. To recite them for a lifetime would suffice."

A record notes: "Zhao the Loyal and Wise’s reading of *The Analects* may be called arrogantly self-assured. Yet he did not know whose fault it was when tigers and rhinoceroses escaped their cages or jade was damaged in its casket—thus, when he said, 'I desire it,' he also made excuses for it. Li the Cultured and Resolute’s reading of *The Analects* may be called humbly self-effacing. Yet he truly governed without weariness and acted with loyalty, so that when he spoke, his words invariably hit the mark. Alas! Such a man—what he foresaw first may be called wisdom; what he did not deceive may be called benevolence; and his lifelong recitation may be called courage. In light of the sage’s words, is he not one who is free from worry, confusion, and fear?"

Later, when Li Hang served as chief minister, Wang Dan became a participating minister. With warfare in the northwest depleting resources to the point of famine, Wang Dan sighed: "How can we sit back and achieve great peace, enjoying leisure without concern?" Li Hang replied: "A little hardship and vigilance serve as warnings. One day, when the realm is at peace, the court may yet face troubles." Wang Dan did not agree. Li Hang further proposed presenting reports on floods, droughts, and banditry from the four quarters, but Wang Dan deemed such matters trivial, unworthy of troubling the emperor’s ears. Li Hang said: "The emperor is young. He should be made aware of the hardships in the realm. Otherwise, with his vigor and strength, if he does not attend to governance but indulges in sensual pleasures, hunting, or extravagant construction, military campaigns, or excessive sacrifices, I, being old, will not live to see it—but you, Participating Minister, will bear the burden of this worry."

After Li Hang’s passing, Emperor Zhenzong, with the Khitan having made peace and the Western Xia having submitted tribute, proceeded to perform the Feng and Shan sacrifices, offer prayers at Mount Fen, and extensively construct palaces and Daoist temples. He sought out and expounded upon neglected classical rites, never resting for a day. Wang Dan, witnessing the conduct of Wang Qinruo, Ding Wei, and their ilk, wished to remonstrate but had already been complicit; he wished to resign but was treated with great favor by the emperor. Thus, recalling Li Hang’s foresight, he sighed and said: "Li Wenjing was truly a sage." From that time on, Li Hang was called the Sage Minister.

A record states: Since *The Book of Shang* sought the Primordial Sage, who has ever been called a Sage Minister? Li Hang’s prescience was as clear as divination by milfoil or tortoiseshell. Throughout the Song dynasty, he stood alone.

Li Hang was sparing in speech when receiving guests and officials. Outside observers thought him as silent as a dried gourd. His younger brother, Wei Cheng, questioned him about this, to which Li Hang replied: "I am not unaware. Yet today, from the highest to the lowest officials in the court, all may speak on matters of state. Memorials submitted under seal reach the throne without obstruction, and upon descending, all may be seen by the relevant offices. For matters of great national importance, men like Li Zongkuo and Zhao Anren—among the finest talents of the age—when discussing affairs with me, still cannot stimulate my thoughts. As for the rest, those newly entered into officialdom, they stumble over their bows and greetings, flustered and at a loss. Once seated, they inevitably boast of their own merits and urge me to recommend them for favor and reward. What strategies could they possibly have to discuss with me? If I were to stoop to empty flattery, that would be what the world calls ‘cage-capturing.’ But cage-capturing is something I cannot do."

A record states: Observing Li Hang’s words, none fail to thoroughly capture the character of later generations. His reference to "cage-capturing" outwardly feigns empty courtesy while inwardly lacking sincerity—a perfect reflection of worldly customs, rendered with utmost precision. Thus, one sees that the Sage Minister’s wisdom left nothing unknown. How, then, could one seek the pity of marketplace urchins and willingly endure the scorn of the discerning?

Chen Shu had long overseen the Three Departments. When Emperor Zhenzong first ascended the throne, he repeatedly ordered Chen to itemize and report the quantities of money and grain held within and beyond the court. Chen delayed for a long time before complying. When repeatedly urged by imperial edict, he replied: "Your Majesty is young and prosperous. If you learn of the fullness of the treasuries and granaries, I fear it may give rise to extravagant desires. Therefore, I dared not report it." The emperor praised him.

A Record states: Chen Shu served in office through mental calculation alone—nothing worthy of note. Yet he had long discerned the emperor’s inclination toward extravagance. Had Chen still been alive, he would never have consented to the elaborate "Heavenly Script" affair, nor could such a thing have been expected of him. Thus, he is recorded here.

When Cao Bin conquered Jiangnan, he returned with nothing but maps, books, and a few garments. His entire household submitted a petition stating: "We humbly advise that he be dispatched to Jiangnan to manage official affairs." Upon his return, people praised him for his lack of boasting. Earlier, when Cao was about to campaign against Tang, the emperor told him: "Once you capture Li Yu, I shall appoint you as a Legate-Minister." Pan Mei offered congratulations in advance, but Cao said: "Not so. In this campaign, we rely on the might of Heaven and follow the court’s strategy—what merit is mine? How could I presume to such a rank?" Pan asked: "What do you mean?" Cao replied: "Taiyuan has yet to be pacified." Upon his return with captives, the emperor said: "I originally intended to appoint you as Legate-Minister, but since Liu Jien has not yet been subdued, we shall wait a while longer." Pan glanced at Cao with a faint smile. The emperor questioned him, and Pan answered truthfully. The emperor laughed heartily and bestowed upon Cao fifty thousand strings of cash. Cao withdrew and remarked: "Why must one be a Legate-Minister? A good official is one who simply acquires more money." Later, he was appointed Military Commissioner.

A Record states: How could Cao Bin’s wisdom and discernment be slighted? Even Ma Yuan faced slander from Liang Song, and Wang Jun was maligned in Zhou Jun’s writings. When a gentleman stands amid merit, he cannot be too cautious. Yet even those who drew their swords to strike pillars or rolled up their sleeves in fury could not silence such calumnies—how much less could a mere Legate-Minister matter? As the *Book of Songs* says: "Without arrogance, without greed—what could go amiss?" In Cao Bin and Pan Mei, one sees a mutual fulfillment.

When Zhang Yong governed Yizhou, the people spread a rumor that a white-haired old man devoured people after noon, throwing the entire prefecture into uproar. The governor inquired in the markets and, upon returning, summoned the rumor’s originator the next day. The man arrived, trembling, and Zhang explained: "When strange rumors arise, it is because perverse qi has taken hold. The strange has form, the rumor has voice. To stop a rumor, one must discern and decide—not outdo it." Moreover, in the aftermath of war and fire, people’s hearts were restless. One day, during a grand military review, the assembled troops had just marched out when suddenly three shouts of "Long live the emperor!" erupted. Zhang dismounted, gazed into the distance, then remounted and continued on. The crowd dared not stir. Someone reported this to Han Qi, who said: "At such a moment, even I would not have known what to do." Zhang’s resourcefulness was largely of this kind.

He once told Li Tian: "In matters great and small, one must employ wisdom. Wisdom is like water—if it does not flow, it stagnates. If one never uses wisdom in ordinary affairs, how can it arise in a moment of crisis?" He also said: "There are three difficulties in handling affairs: first, to perceive the issue; second, to act upon what one perceives; and third, to act decisively when the time comes."

A Record states: Since Mencius spoke of "boring and chiseling," no words have been as urgent as those of the Loyal and Steadfast [Zhang Yong]. Wisdom cannot be forced, nor can it be exhausted. To force it is to bore; to exhaust it is to stagnate. Following principle is to flow; not depleting it is to keep it unexhausted. Thus, to halt a rumor’s spread is to gather it through decisive action; to rein in a shout is to respond with agility. Indecision and slowness are thieves of wisdom. Without these three, one cannot govern a single person, take a single step—how much less the great affairs of the world? Therefore, the words of the Loyal and Steadfast are truly urgent.

When the Khitan invaded Chanzhou, the emperor was greatly alarmed and consulted Kou Zhun. Kou replied: "If Your Majesty wishes to resolve this, it will take no more than five days. I urge you to visit Chanzhou." His colleagues, hearing this, were terrified, and some wished to retreat, but Kou stopped them. He ordered that preparations be made for the imperial procession. The emperor hesitated and was about to return to the palace when Kou urgently detained him, saying: "If Your Majesty enters, I will not be able to see you, and the great matter will be lost." Bi Shi’an strongly urged the emperor to follow Kou’s advice. The emperor then resolved to lead the campaign personally and summoned his ministers to discuss strategy. Wang Qinruo, a man of Linjiang, proposed retreating to Jinling; Chen Yaosou, a man of Meizhou, suggested fleeing to Chengdu. The emperor again asked Kou, who knew full well the二人’s schemes but feigned ignorance, saying: "Whoever devised this plan for Your Majesty deserves execution. Now, with Your Majesty’s divine martial prowess and the harmony of your generals and ministers, if you personally lead the campaign, the enemy will surely flee. Otherwise, we may deploy unexpected tactics to disrupt their plans, hold firm to wear down their forces, and turn the balance of labor and ease to our advantage—victory will be ours."

How could one abandon the ancestral temples and the altars of soil and grain, seeking refuge in Chu or Shu—distant lands where the people’s hearts would collapse? If the enemy, emboldened by victory, pressed deeper, could the realm still be preserved? The emperor then resolved to encamp at Chanzhou.

The *Record* states: During the Jisi Incident of our Ming, Xu Youzhen advocated for a southern retreat, but for Zisu’s resolute opposition, the matter was halted. Which of these two situations was more dire? In my humble view, the Khitan incursion at Chanyuan was but a border skirmish for the Song, with no threat to the stability of the ancestral temples. Yet during the Zhengtong Incident, the imperial carriage was lost in the wilds, the court and realm thrown into turmoil, and the question of whether to stay or flee hung by a thread. At such times, Wang Qinruo and Xu Youzhen were still at large. Given their cunning, why were they not swiftly removed, allowing them to later sow discord? Ah, when a ruler of discerning wisdom sits the throne, black and white are easily distinguished; but when a ruler indulges in ease, right and wrong blur. Once complacency in wealth and comfort takes hold, arrogance and extravagance arise; when the seeds of disaster are forgotten, calamity sprouts. Thus, in the Jingde and Zhengtong eras, the sound counsel of these two men was heeded at first, only for their schemes to bring ruin in the end.

The Sage’s *Book of Changes* warns: *"When it comes to the eighth month, there will be misfortune. How can the noble man be careless? How can he evade it?"*

When the emperor reached the southern walls of Chanzhou and saw the Khitan forces arrayed in overwhelming strength, his attendants urged him to halt. Kou Zhun, however, insisted: "If Your Majesty does not cross the river, the people’s hearts will grow more fearful, and the enemy’s morale will remain unchecked. This is no way to assert authority and secure victory." Though the court’s counselors trembled with fear, Kou pressed his case relentlessly. As he left, he encountered Gao Qiong, the Commander of the Palace Guard, and said: "General, you have received the nation’s favor—how will you repay it today?" Gao replied: "I am but a soldier. I am willing to die for this." Kou then reentered the hall, with Gao standing at attention below. Kou declared in a loud voice: "If Your Majesty does not heed my words, why not ask General Gao and the others?" Gao immediately looked up and proclaimed: "Minister Kou speaks the truth." He then ordered the guards to advance the imperial carriage. The emperor crossed the river and ascended the northern gate tower. From afar, the sight of the imperial canopy stirred the Song troops, who leapt and cheered *"Long live the Emperor!"*—their voices carrying for miles. The Khitan’s spirit was broken.

The emperor entrusted all military affairs to Kou, who exercised command with strict discipline. His orders were clear and solemn, and the soldiers both feared and revered him. Kou did not wish to bribe the Khitan with wealth; instead, he sought to compel their submission, demand the cession of You and Ji, and then proposed a strategy: "If we do this, we may secure a century of peace. Otherwise, in a few decades, the barbarians will grow restless again." Kou’s true aim was to strike them so decisively that none would return. Yet the emperor, weary of war, said: "I cannot bear to further burden the people. Let us accept their offer of peace for now."

The *Record* states: The Song’s Chanzhou is today’s Great Ming. The former’s capital at Bian and the latter’s at Yan are not so far apart in distance. When the Khitan invaded Dingzhou, attacked Baozhou, then Shun’an Army, and finally Beiping, their incursions were much like those of today. The Song had generals like Wei Neng and Shi Pu to repel them in the vanguard, and Tian Min and Wang Chao to block their retreat. Thus, whenever they clashed with Song forces, the Khitan would retreat after minor setbacks, feigning disinterest in battle. Yet at Chanyuan, Kou Zhun stood alone at the front, ready to engage and crush them so thoroughly that not even a single wheel would return. But Emperor Zhenzong first said he would sue for peace, then declared his weariness of war. When the matter of annual tribute arose, he said: "If there is no other choice, even a hundred million could be granted." Are the histories exaggerating?

Moreover, the Han and Tang’s policies of *heqin* relied on a single strategy, while the Song’s oaths combined two approaches. Why were these not fully debated in court, allowing the ruler and his ministers to choose wisely? This year, we recover the River Bend; next year, we change the grand coordinator—yet we never find respite, merely hoping the enemy will not come, or if they do, that they will leave of their own accord. Some say their aim is mere plunder, not conquest—so what harm is there? Alas, this is precisely the "five baits" by which they ensnare us. Why not test this once, rather than let the people’s blood and brains stain the earth?

Thus, I recount the events of Chanyuan to admonish those in power: for the wise, this is the most pressing matter. The urgent task lies here.

The Wisdom of Ruler and Ministers

Yan Shu, at seven, was already skilled in composition. In the early Jingde era, Zhang Zhibai, pacification commissioner of Jiangnan, recommended him as a child prodigy. Emperor Zhenzong summoned him to court, where he took the examination alongside the *jinshi* candidates. Unperturbed, Yan Shu took up his brush and wrote with ease. The emperor praised him highly. Whenever he sought Yan’s counsel on governance, the latter would respond on small slips of paper, sealing his replies with medicinal wax. The emperor valued his prudence, discretion, and wisdom, promoting him to governor of Yingtian Prefecture. There, Yan invited Fan Zhongyan to instruct the students, for he had a lifelong talent for recognizing men of ability. Thus, renowned scholars of the age—such as Zhongyan and Daofu—emerged from his tutelage, while Fu Bi and Yang Cha became his sons-in-law. When he later became chief minister, he devoted himself even more to advancing worthy men. Later, Zhongyan, Han Qi, and Fu Bi all rose to prominence together, filling the court with the finest talents of the day. The emperor, roused to purpose, sought to cultivate these talents to revive the Dao of governance. By the Kangding and Qingli eras, the court was famed for its assembly of able men—all due to Yan Shu’s efforts.

*Record* says: Mencius said, “The wise know all things, but they attend first to what is urgent.” Can the office of chief minister afford not to focus on recognizing talent? Yan Shu began as a child prodigy and ended renowned for his discernment of men—was he not one who, rather than merely observing minor achievements over three years, saw the greater whole? No wonder he became a celebrated minister.

Fan Zhongyan governed Yan Prefecture. Previously, border defenses had been divided, with the *zongguan* commanding ten thousand men, the *ganxia* five thousand, and the *dujian* three thousand. When raiders attacked, the lowest-ranking officer would lead the defense. Fan objected: “To appoint commanders by rank rather than ability is a path to defeat.” He conducted a grand review of the prefectural troops, selecting eighteen thousand men and dividing them into six battalions, each led by a general commanding three thousand. Day and night, they drilled, rotating their deployments according to the enemy’s strength. When the raiders heard of this, they warned one another: “Do not underestimate Yan Prefecture. That ‘Little Fan’ has tens of thousands of armored troops in his belly—he is no ‘Big Fan,’ to be trifled with.”

*Record* says: I observe Fan Zhongyan—at first, he was but a scholar. Yet whence came the tens of thousands of armored troops in his belly? Alas.

This reflects what Zhang Yong meant when he said: "In matters great or small, one must employ wisdom." And was it not such adaptability that enabled the rotational deployment of troops? Thus, those who can apply wisdom find their minds transformed and inexhaustible; those who cannot remain at a loss, unable to advance even a single step. All this lies within oneself—there is no distinction between great or small, old or young. Let the reader take heed.

Di Qing was cautious and reticent, his demeanor deep and strategically astute. He deliberated on affairs only after discerning the opportune moment, then acted decisively. When leading troops, he first disciplined their ranks, enforced rewards and punishments with clarity, and shared in their hunger, cold, and toil. When the enemy dared to challenge him, not a single soldier dared to lag behind or rush ahead. He began as a common soldier, serving as a *sanban* officer. At the start of the *Baoyuan* era, when Zhao Yuanhao rebelled, the troops were fearful and timid. Di Qing, however, would charge into battle with his hair unbound, wearing a bronze mask, cutting through enemy lines without resistance—thus achieving repeated extraordinary feats. Yin Mo admired him and recommended: "This man has the makings of an excellent general."

Fan Zhongyan presented him with the *Zuo Tradition of the Spring and Autumn Annals*, saying: "A general who knows neither past nor present is but a foolhardy braggart." From then on, Di Qing humbly devoted himself to study, mastering all the military strategies from the Qin and Han dynasties onward. Later, when Nong Zhigao rebelled, the emperor grew anxious. Di Qing, then serving as Vice Commissioner of the Bureau of Military Affairs, submitted a memorial requesting to lead the campaign. He was appointed as Pacification Commissioner and dispatched to Guangnan. Initially, the commander Chen Shu had lost discipline, and his troops were routed. Di Qing declared: "When orders are inconsistent, defeat is inevitable." He then executed Chen Shu. At this, the other generals trembled in fear, none daring to meet his gaze.

Di Qing halted his troops and ordered the soldiers to rest for ten days, leading the rebels to assume he would not advance immediately. The next day, he drilled his forces, then marched day and night, cutting through Kunlun Pass to emerge at Guiren Station, where he crushed the rebel army. Among the slain, one corpse wore a golden dragon robe, and the soldiers believed Nong Zhigao had perished, wishing to report this to the throne. Di Qing said, "How can we be certain this is not a ruse? I dare not deceive the court for the sake of claiming merit."

Though Di Qing held high rank, the tattoo on his face remained. When the emperor once ordered him to remove it, he pointed to his face and said, "Your Majesty promoted me for my merit, not my lineage. My present standing comes from this mark. I beg you to leave it, that it may encourage the troops. I dare not obey the decree."

Later, while serving in the Bureau of Military Affairs, someone presented him with the official commission (*gaoshen*) of the Tang statesman Di Renjie, claiming it as an heirloom of his distant ancestor. Di Qing declined, saying, "I rose by chance—how dare I presume kinship with Lord Di?" He rewarded the man and sent him away.

**Record:** Some say Nong Zhigao was not so cunning—yet was he not? The wise seize opportunities swiftly, adapt with agility, and alter their forms without fixed pattern, concealing their moves without fixed exposure. To refuse luck, never forget humiliation, and avoid reckless risks—these are the marks of a true strategist. A general of such caliber is rare indeed. Yet even he could not escape suspicion and doubt. Had he erred in any of these, he would have met his end. The wise must observe a man not only in his strengths but also in his oversights.

In the winter of the eleventh month of the first year of the Xining reign of Emperor Shenzong, the court prepared for the southern suburban sacrifice. The chief ministers, citing drought and famine in the Hebei region and insufficient state funds, petitioned to forgo the customary distribution of gold and silk. The emperor ordered the academicians to deliberate. Sima Guang said, "To relieve disaster and practice frugality, one must begin with the high and near—only then will the people heed the call." Wang Anshi replied, "When Chang Yi declined the post of *biaoci* academician, he said he knew his own limits and should resign, yet could not refuse his salary. The reason for the state’s financial shortage is the lack of a skilled fiscal manager." Sima Guang said, "A skilled fiscal manager does no more than impose head taxes and basket levies." Wang Anshi said, "Not so. A skilled fiscal manager ensures sufficiency without increasing taxes." Sima Guang said, "How can this be? The wealth and goods produced by heaven are finite—if not in the hands of the people, they are in the hands of the state. To devise schemes to seize from the people is more harmful than raising taxes. This is the deceitful rhetoric of Sang Hongyang, which Sima Qian recorded to criticize Emperor Wu’s lack of discernment." Their debate continued without resolution. The emperor said, "My view aligns with Guang’s. For now, reply that the request is denied." As Wang Anshi drafted the edict, he cited the case of Chang Yi to rebuke the two chief ministers, and the matter was dropped.

**Record:** Formerly, Bi Zhongyou, favored by Sima Guang, wrote to him, saying: "Wang Anshi swayed the late emperor with his theories of construction and reform, fretting over insufficient funds. Thus, he implemented every policy that could extract wealth from the people. The *Green Sprouts* loans and *Market Exchange* schemes were his methods, but his true aim was construction, driven by his anxiety over scarcity. If one cannot suppress his motives but merely prohibits his methods, no argument will prevail." How wise were these words!

Moreover, in the mid-Song era, at the height of peace and prosperity, with no external threats and the frugal reigns of Emperors Renzong and Yingzong, no harm had yet been done. Yet the state coffers were empty, and even the customary rewards for the suburban sacrifice were lacking. How could a newly enthroned, ambitious emperor not be moved? The emperor’s refusal was, in truth, a deeper affirmation. Thus, the sage rulers of old, free from desire, sought neither sufficiency nor abundance—yet achieved both. Those who fret over scarcity and strive for abundance, no matter how they scheme, only drift further from the truth, while their opponents’ arguments gain traction. Thus, it was not that Wang Anshi swayed the emperor, but that the emperor surrendered to Wang Anshi. How could this align with Sima Guang’s intent?

When the *Bingyi* official Yue Fei violated military law and faced execution, Zong Ze met him and marveled, saying, "This man is general material." As the Jin forces attacked Fan River, Zong Ze entrusted Yue Fei with five hundred cavalry and ordered him to redeem his crime through merit. Yue Fei routed the Jin and returned, whereupon Zong Ze promoted him to *tongzhi* and said, "Your intelligence, courage, skill, and artistry surpass even the great generals of old. Yet you favor open-field battles—this is not a foolproof strategy." He then presented Yue Fei with battle formations. Yue Fei replied, "To array troops before battle is the common practice of warfare. The subtlety of their application lies in the commander’s mind." Zong Ze approved his words, and Yue Fei rose to fame.

Yue Fei submitted a memorial, saying: "The armies rallying to defend the throne grow daily. We should strike while the enemy rests. Yet Huang Qianshan, Wang Boyan, and their ilk fail to uphold the imperial will to recover lost lands, instead escorting the imperial carriage ever southward, which cannot inspire the hopes of the Central Plains. I beg Your Majesty to seize the moment before the enemy’s lairs are fortified, personally lead the Six Armies north across the river, and rally the troops’ morale—then the Central Plains may yet be reclaimed." For overstepping his rank in submitting this memorial, he was stripped of his post and returned home. He then sought out Zhang Suo, who placed Yue Fei in command of the central army. Zhang Suo asked, "How many enemies can you defeat?" Yue Fei replied, "Bravery alone is unreliable; victory lies in planning. The Han general Le Yi feigned retreat with firewood to lure the Xiongnu into an ambush, while Mozi prevented the siege of Song by sending woodcutters to the enemy—both were cases of premeditated strategy." Zhang Suo nodded in approval and said, "You are no mere soldier." He appointed Yue Fei as *Wu Jing Lang*.

**Record:** Observing how Zong Ze and Zhang Suo recognized Yue Fei’s talent, one sees why, during the Jingkang era, when Zhang Suo sent wax-sealed letters through enemy lines to recruit troops, the people of Hebei rejoiced, saying, "Though the court has abandoned us, we still have a censor like Zhang who can employ men of ability." Those who answered the call numbered nearly 170,000. Zong Ze, as defender of the Eastern Capital, planned to cross the river at Huazhou in the summer, seize Huai, Wei, Jun, and Xiang provinces, and advance along multiple routes. The loyal and righteous people of the mountains responded in the millions. Yet Huang Qianshan and Wang Boyan treated the very foundation of the state as if it were beyond concern.

Yet Yue Fei’s overstepping of his rank was precisely the fulfillment of duty by these two men. Had there been one like Gaozu who heeded Xiao He’s counsel and embraced Deng Yu’s strategies, would he not have been counted among the founders of great merit? Instead, burdened with measureless wisdom and courage, he met the same fate as those who cast their lots blindly. The gentleman may only lament the fortune or misfortune of such men, not the clarity or blindness of the emperor or his ministers.

Zhao Ding and Zhang Jun both served as Left and Right *Shangshu Pushe*, concurrently overseeing the Bureau of Military Affairs and commanding the armies of all circuits. At the time, Ding and Jun enjoyed great harmony. When their appointments were announced, Yu Chu, a collator of the Historiography Institute, came to Zhang’s gate and said: "The two of you should first serve together in the Bureau of Military Affairs. Later, when Zhao retires, Zhang may succeed him. In matters of governance and personnel, if your approaches are not too divergent, your influence will endure. But if you share the same office and later disagree—even if one of you must resign—it will inevitably lead to reversal. Thus, the worthy will turn against one another." The outcome later proved Chu’s words true.

The Record states: In observing Yu Zicun’s predictions of events, one may call them largely accurate. When Xiao passed and Cao rose, when Bing preceded and Wei followed, when Fang devised plans and Du made decisions, when Chong initiated change and Jing established laws—though they were said to harmonize in heart and share virtue, in truth, they carried forward excellence and trod in fragrant footsteps. Thus, the Dao and virtue flowed endlessly, and their achievements and merits endured through the ages. These are what later generations look up to with admiration.

As for Ding and Jun, though they claimed to govern with upright hearts and lofty aspirations, their resolve fixed on the public good, one sees how a single word from Fei led to discord, and how deep trust was withdrawn due to Kui’s deceptive appearance. This shows they had not truly forgotten self-interest or cultivated a mind free of ego. How, then, could they have avoided turning against one another? In the end, petty grievances from others gave rise to their mutual disharmony. Zicun’s words were not without proof. Thus, they are recorded here.

Han Shizhong, chastened by the affair of Yue Fei, thereupon returned to the state the million strings of cash, ninety thousand *shi* of grain, and fifteen wine storehouses he had accumulated as military provisions. He submitted a memorial requesting retirement. From then on, he shut his gates to visitors and never spoke of military matters. At times, he would ride a donkey, carrying wine and accompanied by one or two servant boys, roaming freely among the lakes and mountains for his own enjoyment.

Few of his generals and aides ever saw his face in ordinary times. When he first fell ill, the court urgently sent physicians to treat him, but Shizhong said: “I rose from common cloth to fight through a hundred battles, attaining the rank of duke. By the grace of Heaven’s spirit, I have kept my head and limbs intact. Why should you gentlemen still mourn my death?” He once admonished his family, saying: “My name is Shizhong. Let none of you avoid the word *zhong* [loyalty]. To avoid it in speech is to forget loyalty.” He had particularly opposed the peace negotiations, incurring much of Qin Hui’s resentment. When others urged him to desist, he replied: “Today, fear of disaster makes compliance easy. But when I close my eyes in death, how could I bear to face the iron staff of the Grand Progenitor in the underworld?” At the time, most great generals curried favor with Qin Hui to seek temporary safety. Though Shizhong and Qin Hui served together in government, they exchanged nothing beyond a single bow, never speaking. The weapons and armor he designed were of unparalleled precision. He knew men well and rewarded them generously, so his subordinates remained steadfast in their loyalty. Though he lay at home for a decade, stripped of his banner and staff, he remained composed and at ease, as if he had never held power or rank.

It is recorded: The joys of lakes and mountains were, for Shizhong, a mark of wisdom, yet for the noble man, they are deemed unworthy. Why? Since King Goujian of Yue slept on brushwood and tasted gall, only then did Wu perish.

Since the wanton southern expeditions of the late capital’s Jing Dynasty, the Song began its fall—all witnessed firsthand. How could it be that rulers did not set their hearts on avenging humiliation and eliminating villains, while their ministers instead made it their business to resent merit and envy ability? Thus, heroic generals were turned into sycophantic courtiers, scheming only for self-preservation. Was there any other choice?

Though they resisted the peace negotiations, their words remained empty, never put into action. Then did the spirits of the successive sagely emperors in heaven know of this—or did they not?

During the Battle of Shunchang, Liu Qi recruited two men, Cao Cheng and another, to serve as spies. They feigned falling from their horses upon encountering the enemy and were captured. Wumu asked, “What sort of man is Qi?” They replied, “A frontier commander in peacetime, fond of singing girls. The court, seeking harmony between the two nations, stationed him in the Eastern Capital merely to indulge in leisure.” Wumu laughed and said, “This will be easy to crush.” The next day, he arrived beneath the city walls and rebuked his generals for their losses. They all said, “The Southern Court’s military prowess is not what it once was.” Wuzhu refused to believe them, and Qi advanced his troops.

His officers urged him to strike Han Chang’s army first, but Qi said, “Even if we drive Wumu back by defeating Han, his elite troops will remain, and we cannot withstand them. Our strategy must be to strike Wumu first. Once he moves, the rest will be powerless.” At the time, Wumu wore a white robe, discarded his armor and horse, and led three thousand elite troops into battle. These men wore heavy lamellar armor and iron helmets, called the “Iron Pagodas.” Qi used spears to knock off their helmets and axes to sever their arms. There were also the “Crutch Horses,” known as the Ever-Victorious Army, which were likewise broken in this battle.

In this engagement, Qi’s forces numbered no more than twenty thousand, with only five thousand deployed in combat. Yet through premeditated strategy, undistracted by the counsel of other generals, and refusing to be misled by past victories or overconfidence, he triumphed with the few against the many, the rested against the weary. Thus did he achieve success.

Hong Hao secretly memorialized from Jin that the victory at Shunchang had struck terror into the enemy, who now considered abandoning the lands south of Yan. He wrote that if the various generals had united at that moment, advancing along separate routes, Wumu could have been captured and Bianjing recovered. Yet the imperial armies hastily withdrew, squandering the opportunity—truly a pity.

It is recorded: The *Art of War* states that a general must possess wisdom, trustworthiness, benevolence, courage, and strictness; lacking even one, he is unfit. Wisdom stands foremost. This is why Liu Qi achieved victory at Shunchang, and even the mediocre would leap for joy at such a triumph.

By then, the peace accords were already concluded—like an examination essay barely worth glancing at. Beyond this, all was a realm of forced compromise. What further opportunities remained?

Wang Lixin, serving as Pacification Commissioner Along the Yangtze in Jiangling, memorialized to strengthen the garrison at Anlu Prefecture, warning that frontier defenses should not be depleted. He proposed three measures:

First, all troops from the inner provinces should be deployed to reinforce the outer defenses. With over seven hundred thousand soldiers available, the old, weak, and unfit—two out of every seven—should be weeded out, leaving a select force of over five hundred thousand. The Yangtze defenses, spanning no more than seven thousand *li*, should be garrisoned at intervals of a hundred *li*, each post under a commander. Ten posts would form a prefecture, each with an overseer. At critical points, troop numbers should be doubled or tripled. In peacetime, patrols would sail the Huai River, maintaining vigilance; in war, they would strike east and west, combining offense and defense, with watchtowers signaling and supplies flowing uninterrupted, forming a linked and mutually reinforcing formation. A royal prince of the imperial clan and a capable, loyal minister should be appointed as supreme commanders, dividing authority between eastern and western prefectures to achieve the unity of a coiled serpent. This is the highest strategy.

Second, the prolonged detention of envoys benefits us nothing, merely giving the enemy pretext for delay. They should be sent home with courtesy, and annual tribute offered to postpone hostilities. Within two or three years, the frontier would stabilize, defenses strengthen, and fresh troops grow in number, enabling both offense and defense. This is the middle strategy.

Jia Sidao cast the memorial to the ground, declaring, “Mad bandit! How dare you speak such treason!” He then used legal pretexts to dismiss Wang from office.

Later, after Jia Sidao’s military defeat, Wang was recalled as Pacification Commissioner and ordered to recruit troops in Jiankang to reinforce the Yangtze commanderies. He set out at once and encountered Jia Sidao at Wuhu. Jia patted Wang’s back and said, “Had I heeded your words, this would not have happened.”

Upon reaching Jiankang, the garrison had already collapsed, and Yuan forces surrounded the city on all sides. Wang, realizing the situation was hopeless, sighed, “I lived as a Song minister; I shall die as a Song ghost.”

When someone relayed Wang’s two strategies to Boyan, the latter sighed and said, “Had the Song possessed such a man and truly employed him, how could I have come to this?”

It is recorded: Mencius said, “One without a sense of right and wrong is not human.” By then, the Yangtze strategy had already descended to the lowest plan—like a man with a scorched head and blistered face, not a moment to spare. To call this madness is to ask: had he truly lost his mind?

Yet Jia Sidao was not mad. He was merely intoxicated by poison, steeped in corruption to the point of no return—no longer human. Heaven would use the hand of Zheng Huchen to expose his treasonous crimes, leaving him no choice but to meet this end.

*The Record of Illustrious Ministers of the August Ming* states: Liu Ji, Earl of Chengyi, was a man of fervent intelligence, versed in astronomy. While staying in Hangzhou, he once strolled by West Lake when a strange cloud arose in the northwest, its light shimmering upon the water. His companions took it for an auspicious cloud and composed poems on the theme, but Liu drank deeply and said, “This is the *qi* of an emperor, destined for Jinling. In ten years, a true king shall rise, and I shall serve him.”

When the Grand Progenitor seized Jinhua and pacified Kuocang, Liu pointed to the celestial signs and told his confidants, “This is the Mandate of Heaven. How could mere human effort achieve it?”

Indeed, an envoy was dispatched to extend an invitation. Liu then took a secret route to Jinling, where he presented eighteen strategies on current affairs. At the time, the Chen clan had launched an invasion, and some schemed to surrender the city, while others, noting that Zhongshan bore the *qi* of a king, sought to flee and occupy it. Liu alone declared: “In my judgment, nothing is better than emptying the treasury, opening our hearts with utmost sincerity, and thus securing the loyalty of our soldiers. Moreover, the Dao of Heaven favors those who act last—we should lie in ambush, wait for an opening, and strike. Seizing authority to subdue the enemy and establishing the royal enterprise—this is the moment for it.” The Emperor accordingly adopted Liu’s strategy, launching an attack with the wind at their backs. The ambush succeeded, and the enemy was slaughtered without count.

When the Secretariat set up an imperial throne to honor the Young Ming King, Liu angrily rebuked them, saying: “That herdsman—why honor him?” He refused to bow, declaring that the Mandate of Heaven lay elsewhere. The Emperor, moved by his words, resolved upon a campaign of conquest.

When Hu Junmei, the defending general of Hongdu, sent his son to negotiate surrender, the Emperor initially hesitated. Liu, standing behind him, kicked the leg of the Emperor’s folding chair, signaling his approval. Hu Junmei then surrendered the city.

Later, the Emperor repeatedly sought to appoint Liu as prime minister, but Liu declined, saying: “The office of prime minister is a weighty responsibility for the state. It is like replacing a pillar—only the greatest talent will suffice; if one binds small timbers together, collapse will come swiftly. Though I am not unaware of my own abilities, my hatred of evil runs too deep, and I cannot endure the burdens of the post. To accept would be to betray the great favor shown me.” The Emperor thus held Liu in even higher esteem, addressing him as “Elder Master” without using his name, and saying: “He is my Zhang Liang.”

Liu once wrote a book, fearing he would not live to see its completion, and left it to the world, hoping that later generations would take its intent to heart and apply it themselves. Thus, Liu’s achievements are fully set forth in his writings—this is why the Yuan fell. And his writings are manifest in his achievements—this is why the August Ming rose. The acceptance or rejection of a single man bears such weight upon the realm and the state.

The *Record* states: Yang Wenyi once remarked: “Zhang Liang’s strategies are not found in literary compositions, and Fang Xuanling’s writings consist merely of memorials and official documents, with no manifestos or proclamations to be seen. To possess the merit of founding a dynasty while also leaving behind writings for posterity—Liu may be called the hero of a thousand ages.”

Some question his service to the Yuan, while others praise only his observations of celestial phenomena. This is like criticizing Yi Yin for his five submissions or reducing the Duke of Zhou to his talents and skills alone. In my view, Liu’s refusal of the prime minister’s post is clear evidence of his sagely wisdom. The world deemed no one superior to him, yet he humbly saw himself as lacking—his superiority over others was vast, far beyond those who rely on cunning and schemes.

During the Yongle and Xuande reigns, the eminent ministers were known as the Three Yangs: Yang Wenjing of the West, Yang Wenmin of the East, and Yang Wending of the South. Yang Wenmin was naturally bright and quick-witted, possessing decisive talent. Whenever court matters arose and eunuchs were sent to the Grand Secretariat for deliberation, they would invariably ask: “Is the Eastern Yang Master present?” If told he was not, they would return at once. Yet in discussions, he never failed to defer to others. If Yang Wenjing insisted something could not be done, the matter would ultimately be decided by Yang Wenmin, who would resolve it with such clarity that no obstacles remained.

Each autumn, when the emperor ordered civil and military officials to review cases of serious offenders, all from the Duke of Ying downward would defer to the Two Yang Masters for judgment. Yang Wenjing would examine the cases but never render a decision; when matters became irresolvable, Yang Wenmin would ask a single question and settle them, leaving all in awe.

At the time, the sovereign was martial and heroic. Few among the assembled ministers could satisfy him in their memorials and responses, but he cherished Yang Wending’s talent and never let him leave his side for a day. The most confidential plans and strategies invariably involved him. When major ministers deliberated on unresolved matters and the Emperor grew displeased—even to the point of anger—Yang Wending’s arrival would calm his wrath, and the matter would proceed smoothly.

Yang Wending once said to Xia Zhongzhao, the Minister of Rites: “I have often deeply regretted seeing ministers who, by resisting with unbending integrity, brought disaster upon themselves. There is a proper way to serve a ruler, and a proper way to offer remonstrance. For example, if the Emperor reads the *Thousand-Character Classic* and says, ‘Heaven and Earth, dark and red,’ one should not immediately correct him. How can one know he is not testing me? And how can one know what is truly on his mind? Wait until he repeats it, or asks a question, then respond: ‘In my youth, I read the *Thousand-Character Classic*, which says, “Heaven and Earth, dark and yellow”—I do not know if this is correct.’ His wisdom was generally of this kind.”

Li Shimian later added: “Before Yang Wenjing entered office, he and Wu Youweng, a tutor to the Prince of Chu, had been implicated in a treasonous plot. Youweng told me: ‘Master Yang was broadly learned and wise, upright yet sensitive, generous and kind, perceptive in understanding affairs, and never arrogant or dismissive of others. Once he entered the inner court and took charge of state affairs, his fairness and magnanimity, his tolerance and discipline, were all directed solely toward the state, never toward private gain. When facing major policies or resolving great doubts, while others argued endlessly, he alone remained unshaken. After a long silence, he would offer a single word, and all would be subdued and convinced. If public opinion was divided and required the Emperor’s attention, once it was presented, the Emperor would ultimately follow Master Yang’s counsel. In the Emperor’s presence, he spoke his mind on all matters, regardless of personal advantage or harm. When evaluating talent or correcting others’ faults, he acted with impartiality, never weighing favor or enmity in his judgments. In recommending the worthy and rejecting the unfit, he possessed the power to turn the heavens and shift the earth—yet he never boasted of it. The duties of a great minister and prime minister are evident in such conduct.’”

The *Record* states: In my view, the circumstances of the Three Yangs were no different from those of earlier eras. In the records of today, one sees the spirit of Fang Xuanling and Du Ruhui’s deference; in the annals of the Eastern Waters, the dynamic of Chen Ping and Zhou Bo’s rise from obscurity; and in their collected writings, the foundational principles of Han Qi and Fan Zhongyan’s conduct. How wise were these men, who emerged from darkness into light, built merit, and established great deeds!

The *Record* concludes: Chen Yi, the Earl of Pingjiang, was resourceful and strategically astute. During the Jingnan Campaign, when the imperial army reached the north bank of the Yangzi, Chen, recognizing where the Mandate of Heaven had settled, led his naval forces to welcome and ferry them across. He was enfeoffed as Earl of Pingjiang.

At the time, the military provisions in Beijing were insufficient, so the court commanded him to oversee the annual transport of a million *shi* of grain, conveyed by sea. He established the Million-*Shi* Granary at Zhigu, constructed the walled city of Tianjin Garrison, and registered ten thousand soldiers to defend it. Along the sea islands through which the transport routes passed, the barbarian tribes, struck with awe, all hid themselves. He issued orders allowing them to come forth for trade, dispatching officials to supervise and maintain fairness. No one dared to cause disturbance, and both sides found it convenient.

After Beijing was established as the capital, sea transport was abolished. He proposed the construction of two thousand shallow-draft barges, initially transporting two million *shi* annually, later increasing to five million *shi*. He dredged the Qingjiang and Pu waterways, channeling water from Guanjia Lake into Yachenkou to reach the Huai River, thereby avoiding the perils of wind and waves on the outer river. Along Guanjia Lake, he built a ten-*li* embankment to facilitate the passage of boats. He cleared the silted tidal inlets of the Yizhen and Guazhou dams, leveled the massive rocks of the Lüliang and Xuzhou rapids to calm the water flow, constructed long dikes at Diaoyang Lake in Pei County and Nanwang Lake in Jining, opened the Baita River in Taizhou to connect with the Yangzi, and built dikes along Gaoyou Lake. Within the dikes, he dredged a forty-*li* canal to allow boat passage, constructing bridges north and south for ease of travel.

From the Huai River to Linqing, he surveyed the water levels and built forty-seven locks, timing their opening and closing to ensure perpetual navigation. He also established 568 stations along the river, each staffed with guides to assist shallow-water passage, and dug wells and planted trees along the embankments for travelers’ convenience. Every consideration was thorough, and every undertaking was decisive.

The *Record* states: At that time, when north and south were not yet connected, Heaven in its bounty raised an extraordinary man by the aid of the Yangzi. Though one might wish to dispense with the mountains and rivers, how could they be set aside? Alas! He began with the enfeoffment of Pingjiang and ended with renown for his river-crossing feats. As the *Book* says: "To cross a great river, I employ you as my boat and oar." These words were no falsehood. Thus, his temple sacrifices were held in assembly, and his offerings of blood and flesh never ceased—surely for this reason.

Zhou Chen, Duke Wenxiang, initially passed the imperial examinations and was selected as a bachelor of the Hanlin Academy, among twenty-eight men including Zeng Cai. He personally petitioned to join their studies. Emperor Taizong rejoiced, saying, "This is a man of true ambition," and ordered his inclusion.

Later, he served as Vice Minister of Works and Grand Coordinator of the Southern Metropolitan Region for twenty-two years. Profoundly astute and wise, he was humble and courteous, rarely speaking harshly, yet his plans and considerations were far-reaching, and he excelled at gathering diverse opinions. For every policy he implemented, he first consulted the common folk, elders, and local officials before making decisions. He had an exceptional memory, even for details. Once, a cunning man attempted to deceive him with several fabricated grievances. He said, "You were already compensated for that matter in such-and-such a place. Why do you speak of it again?" When officials concealed tax grain, he would say, "In such-and-such a year, so much was allocated there; in another year, so much was retained." Verifying the records confirmed his words, and the officials, astonished, acknowledged his uncanny precision.

Initially, Suzhou’s tax grain was in arrears by over 7.9 million *shi*, and the same was true for Changshu and Songjiang. Repeatedly dispatched officials pressed for payment, but the situation remained unresolved. Upon his arrival, he inquired of the elders, who explained that in Suzhou and Songjiang, the wealthy households did not pay the additional surcharge, burdening the smaller households with the shortfall. He then mandated that all households, large and small, pay the surcharge equally. He memorialized the throne, and the Southern Capital cast iron measuring vessels to ensure fairness. He also abolished the old practice of allowing local organizations to collect grain.

He said, "This is the reason for the arrears." He then ordered each county to appoint a single overseer at the water’s edge, called the *zong*. Collection standards and surcharges were fixed, and after fulfilling transport quotas, any surplus grain stored in the granaries was designated as "reserve rice." The following year, the surcharge was adjusted based on the previous year’s surplus. After meeting transport quotas, any remaining surplus was stored in newly constructed granaries called "Aid-the-Farmer" granaries. This grain was used for famine relief, or lent to farmers in need or transport workers who suffered from wind damage or theft, to be repaid in kind at harvest. All official textile production and military provisions were drawn from these reserves. Thus, beyond the annual tax of one *shi* and five *dou*, the people saw no additional corvée labor, and officials no longer imposed extortionate demands.

He repaired and dredged the temples of former worthies in county schools, as well as bridges and waterways in various prefectures, all funded by the surplus grain. The people competed to erect living shrines in his honor, and after his death, he was enshrined and worshipped.

Later, the Ministry of Revenue reported that the Aid-the-Farmer surplus grain had gone unaccounted for and dispatched officials to reclaim it entirely for the state. Thereafter, miscellaneous levies proliferated, and tax arrears returned as before. The people longed for him all the more.

The *Record* states: Minister Wang Wenke, discussing Censor-in-Chief He Yin, said: "Wealth is born of the earth, completed by Heaven, but its governance lies with man. When governance has method, insufficiency becomes abundance; when it lacks method, abundance becomes insufficiency. Its expansion and contraction, gain and loss, all depend on the person. As for Wenxiang, he was truly such a man." Thus, he often cited him as a model for grand coordinators.

In former times, the prefectures of Jiangnan suffered frequent shortages in both public and private stores. Yet in recent years, bountiful harvests followed one another, and grain overflowed. Had one investigated the cause, it would have been found in human effort, not the timing of Heaven. During Grand Coordinator He’s tenure, Jiangnan faced a great famine. He submitted twelve strategies for famine relief, securing 800,000 *shi* of grain from military provisions, local reserves, and official salaries. Thus, every prefecture in Jiangnan was well-supplied, and the court approved the dredging of Wusong and Baimao Port. When funds were lacking, he requested that military provisions be redirected, using 280,000 *shi* of grain without waste. Upon completion of the project, the southeast was free from water disasters.

To attribute the abundance or scarcity of the harvest solely to the timing of Heaven—can this be right? What is meant by "turning insufficiency into surplus" is not this. Such was the wisdom of Wenzheng, which is still remembered today.

The Suzhou Prefect Kuang Zhong began as a minor clerk serving Minister Lü Zhen. Impressed by his talent, Lü recommended him for the position of Director in the Bureau of Ceremonies under the Ministry of Rites, later promoting him to Gentleman of the Ministry. At the beginning of Renzong’s reign, an edict commanded all officials of the fifth rank and above in the capital to recommend those they knew. Kuang Zhong thus recommended Zhang Zongkuang of the Left Spring Pavilion. Renzong summoned Yang Shiqi and asked, "Everyone recommends low-ranking officials from distant prefectures—why has Kuang Zhong recommended one of my palace officials?" Yang Shiqi replied, "Wang Zhi and I had intended to recommend him, but he has unexpectedly beaten us to it." Renzong exclaimed with delight, "That Kuang Zhong recognizes Zongkuang’s worth—this truly marks him as a man of virtue." For he had already intended to employ him.

When Xuanzong ascended the throne, his ministers memorialized that Suzhou, a vast and complex prefecture, was difficult to govern. Kuang Zhong was thus promoted to Prefect.

Upon arrival, he dismissed five corrupt and oppressive subordinate officials and over ten incompetent and weak ones. He then conferred with Inspector Zhou to study methods for grain collection. Since the Yongle era, grain had been transported to Beijing, but the supply route to Liaodong was long. For every *shi* of grain levied, three were collected, so that the prefecture’s 2,700,000 *shi* became 8,100,000 *shi*. After deducting the regular tribute and the costs of ceremonial vessels and transport, the surplus was concealed by the grain chiefs. Kuang thus proposed establishing separate grain heads to divide their power, abolishing one-third of the old triple levy and designating the remaining two-thirds as transport fees. The rest of the grain was stored in the *Jinong* Granary to serve as capital for the following year’s expenditures.

That year, tens of thousands of *shi* of horse fodder and grain, tens of thousands of *jin* of summer tax cloth and silk, tens of thousands of bolts of silk fabric, and tens of thousands of *shi* of wheat were all paid using surplus grain. All miscellaneous expenses were also procured with these reserves. The court did not miss its tax deadlines, nor did the people bear the slightest burden. In times of drought or disaster, he promptly distributed relief, saving hundreds of thousands of lives each time. His beneficence extended endlessly to the poor and destitute.

When his nine-year term ended, over 80,000 people of the prefecture besieged the palace gates to petition for his retention, and he was thus sent to serve a second term. Later, he died of illness, and the people vied to establish shrines in his honor.

**Record states:** The depletion of resources in Suzhou and Songjiang before this time—where great households avoided surcharges—was perhaps of this kind. At the time, the court had a sovereign like Renzong and ministers like Wenxiang; Kuang’s wisdom and kindness were like a goose feather borne on a favorable wind. Had it not been so, a minor clerk daring to act would have been outmaneuvered by the grand ministers of the court; a mere prefect securing the support of 80,000 petitioners would have faced opposition from court deliberations. It would have been difficult to escape such a fate in the world of today. Thus, it is recorded.

*Hongdao Record*, Scroll Forty—end.

**Hongdao Record, Scroll Forty-One: Wisdom – The Wisdom of Father and Son**

From the *Canon of Yao*: The Emperor said, “Whom shall I consult to ascend the throne?”
Fang Qi replied, “Your son Zhu is enlightened.”
The Emperor said, “Alas! Is one so litigious and perverse fit for this?”

**Record states:** This was the unique insight of a great sage, surpassing all ages. Here, he decisively chose to transmit the throne to the worthy rather than to his son. The distinction between sagacity and folly lies in the subtlest of margins. A nature inclined toward clarity approaches the mind of the Dao, yet if it is not wholly aligned with heavenly principle, its expression in speech will inevitably descend into contention. Thus, the sage adjudicates between principle and desire at the finest of lines. If even the slightest deviation occurs, one may mistake clarity for wisdom and contention for talent—how much more so with the coarseness of Dan Zhu or the wickedness of the Emperor’s son? If such were the standard, later ages would still see those whose intelligence resists remonstrance, whose words gloss over faults, and who believe all under heaven inferior to themselves. By this measure, Zhu was already above ten thousand men.

From the *Records of the Grand Historian*: Emperor Yi of the Shang had three sons. The eldest was Weizi Qi, the second Zhonghang, and the youngest Shou Xin—who was none other than King Zhou. Zhou’s mother was a virtuous queen, and when Zhou was still young, Emperor Yi and the queen wished to appoint Qi as crown prince. The Grand Historian, citing the law, objected: “The son of a wife cannot be passed over in favor of the son of a concubine.” Thus, Zhou was made heir.

**Record states:** Emperor Yi’s decision was an ill fate for the Shang, yet perhaps it was also the ordained end of Heaven’s mandate. The Grand Historian’s objection was the just law of the realm. At the time, Zhou’s mother was virtuous and her son still young—how could Emperor Yi have foreseen the kingdom’s ruin and preemptively altered the succession? Later cases, such as those of Fusu and Yang Yong, were truly failures of human counsel. Moreover, the Shang abandoned Weizi despite his inability to inherit, while the Zhou went further with Taibo and Boyi Kao, both passing over the eldest to enthrone the younger. Was this not the work of Heaven’s mandate?

King Gu of the Zhou had three sons: the eldest Taibo, the second Zhongyong, and the youngest Jili. Jili married Tairen, a woman of virtue and wisdom, who bore Chang, marked by auspicious omens. King Gu said, “Our line is destined to rise—surely it will be through Chang.” Taibo and Zhongyong, perceiving their father’s intent to enthrone Jili and thus transmit the throne to Chang, fled to the Jing barbarians, tattooing their bodies and cutting their hair to signal their withdrawal from succession. After King Gu’s death, Jili ascended as Duke Ji. Duke Ji upheld his father’s legacy, devoted to righteousness, and the feudal lords submitted to him. Upon his death, his son Chang succeeded him as the Western Earl.

**Record states:** The hexagram *Sheng* (Ascending) is yielding yet compliant, firm yet centered, thus achieving great success. From King Gu onward, the Zhou ascended through sincerity, with Taibo and Zhongyong responding in faithful submission below. Thus, Duke Ji’s rise to his empty domain met no obstruction, culminating in the Western Earl’s founding of the royal enterprise—was this mere chance? Had King Tai lacked the clarity of trust and compliance, or had Taibo lacked the wisdom of yielding response, Chang’s dragon-like virtue and centered strength would have been of no avail. This shows that King Wen’s *Book of Changes* was rooted in his family’s tradition and embodied experience. The line, “The king offers sacrifice on Mount Qi,” was no empty claim—how could it lack verification?

In the *Kong Congzi*, Duke Mu asked Zisi: “Is there a fixed rule for appointing a crown prince?”
Zisi replied, “There is.”
The Duke said, “In the past, King Wen passed over his eldest to enthrone his second son, while Weizi passed over his grandson to appoint his younger brother—what law governed this?”
Zisi said, “The Shang valued substance and honored the most venerable, hence they appointed the younger brother. The Zhou valued refinement and cherished kinship, hence they appointed the son. Each followed its own rites. Though substance and refinement differ, their rites vary accordingly. King Wen’s passing over the eldest to appoint the second was an exercise of discretion.”
The Duke said, “If discretion may be exercised, is it only sages who may appoint the worthy or beloved?”
Zisi replied, “Sages do not teach discretion, so they establish systems and bequeath laws, prizing compliance. If one insists on violating these, what difference remains? The distinction is clear.”
The Duke said, “Is it better to pass over the worthy to appoint the sagely, or the foolish to appoint the worthy?”
Zisi replied, “Only a sage appoints the sagely—was this not King Wen? Those lesser than King Wen each favor their beloved, making no distinction between them and the eldest. How can they be constrained? If they cannot discern the difference between the worthy and the foolish, let them consult their fathers, elder brothers, ministers, and divine in the ancestral temple—this, too, is a permissible exercise of discretion.”
**Record states:** These are the words of a great worthy, precisely targeting the failings of humanity—unalterable for ten thousand generations. Yao’s son was enlightened, and Shun’s son embodied yielding virtue. Without the utmost sagacity, who could pass over one to appoint the other? How much more so for later ages, where blind affection prevails? Without fixed limits, if discretion is left to individuals, the resulting calamities would be beyond reckoning. As for divination, though the ancients did not abandon it, it was a last resort of discretion, not the attainment of wisdom.

From the *Zuozhuan*: The Marquis of Jin rewarded those who had followed him in exile. Jie Zhitui did not speak of reward, and thus received none. He said, “Of Duke Xian’s nine sons, only the lord remains. Hui and Huai were devoid of kinship, spurned within and without. Heaven has not yet severed Jin’s line—there must be a master. Who but the lord could preside over Jin’s sacrifices? Heaven established him, yet these few gentlemen claim it as their own achievement—is this not a deception? To steal another’s wealth is called theft—how much worse to covet Heaven’s merit! Below, they justify their crimes; above, they are rewarded for their treachery. With superiors and inferiors deceiving one another, how can one dwell among them?”
His mother said, “Why not also seek reward? To die—whom would you blame?”
He replied, “To imitate their faults would be an even greater crime. Moreover, I have spoken resentful words—how could I consume his food?”

His mother said, “Then at least let him know—what would be the harm?”
He replied, “Speech is the ornament of the person. If one’s person is about to withdraw from the world, why adorn it with words? That would be seeking renown.”
His mother said, “If you can be thus, I shall withdraw with you.”
Thereupon they went into hiding and died.
The Lord of Jin sought them in vain and made Mianshang a field in their memory, saying, “To mark my error and to honor a man of virtue.”

It is recorded: When Jie of Mianshang abandoned his lands, was he not wiser than those who opened Nanyang for Jin? In the troubles at Wen, Heaven had not yet turned from the Zhou. Zidai’s impiety and want of filial devotion meant his ruin could not be long delayed—how the Earl of Qin counted it his achievement! Yet Lord Wen appropriated it as his own, differing from the beggar who merely sought a single draught of ale. As for the hardships endured in the wilderness, those nineteen years were not the work of a single morning or evening. Jie declined office and received no emolument—could he have sought it through royal decree? Though the recluse conceals his person, his name becomes renowned. How noble was Master Jie! Had he not acted thus, he would have been clad in enmity and waited upon by thieves—could he truly have remained silent? To speak would have been to grovel before eunuchs and lackeys—no wonder Master Jie chose silence.

The mother of Jin’s Shu Xiang, like the mother of Tuo Shu Hu, saw beauty but would not allow it. Both sons remonstrated with her. She said, “In the depths of mountains and marshes, dragons and serpents are born. That beauty—it makes me fear she would bear dragons and snakes, bringing calamity upon you.” She sent someone to observe her in sleep, and she gave birth to Shu Hu, who was handsome and possessed great strength. Duke Huai of Yue delighted in him, and so he returned to face peril. When Shu Xiang wished to marry the daughter of Shen’s Lord Wu Chen, his mother said, “The wife of Ziling brought three husbands, one lord, and one son to servitude, and destroyed one state and two ministers. Should we not take warning?” I have heard it said: extreme beauty must harbor extreme evil.

This was the son of Zheng Mu’s lesser consort, Lady Yao, and the younger sister of Zi Mo. Zi Mo died young without an heir, and Heaven concentrated beauty in her, surely intending thereby to bring great harvest. Shu Xiang feared and dared not marry her, but Duke Ping forcibly compelled him to do so, and she bore Bo Shi. When Bo Shi was first born, the mother of Zi Rong hastened to inform the aunts, saying, “Elder Shu Si has given birth to a boy—come, aunts, and see him.” When she reached the hall, she heard his cry and turned back, saying, “That is the voice of a jackal or wolf. A wolf cub has a wild heart; if not this, nothing will destroy the Yang She clan.” And so she refused to look at him.

It is recorded: In my foolish view, the wisdom of the mother of the Yang She clan is worthy of much praise; one ought not to slight her merely because she was a mother-in-law. When the age above is sagely, the means by which it is perfected lie far back; when within there is a worthy consort, the aid she provides runs deep. If one is to serve the age with perspicacious virtue and upright conduct, this is the thread upon which it hangs—how much more so when one slays Heaven’s favored son, calling him a man who would ruin state and family? In a well-ordered age, criminals are not taken as wives; here, one may say, judgment failed. Her vast learning and wide hearing were but the chaff and husk of knowledge.

Thus the noble man must devote himself to sincerity of intention and rectitude of heart, cultivating the self and ordering the household, not permitting the slightest laxity or the least carelessness. Proceeding thus to beget and rear descendants, there will be none who are not good.

In the *Guo Yu*, Qi Xi declined the post of military commander. The Duke asked him, saying, “Who is fit for the position?” He replied, “My son Wu is fit.” Someone said, “In choosing ministers, none is better than the ruler; in choosing a son, none is better than the father.” When Wu was young, he was gentle and obedient, moving among ministers and dwelling in his place; he loved learning and did not play. In his prime, he was strong of purpose and followed commands, guarding his inheritance without excess. When he came of age, he was harmonious and tranquil, reverent and kind to small things, while steady in great matters; he had an upright nature and no wayward heart, changing only for righteousness and advancing only at his superior’s behest. If faced with great affairs, he would surely surpass his father. I ask to recommend one whom I can choose, and whom Your Lordship may judge by righteousness. The Duke then appointed Qi Wu as military commander, and throughout Duke Ping’s reign, the army was without misgovernance.

It is recorded: In my foolish view, Qi Xi’s words differ not at all from the teachings of today’s humble scholars to their sons. From youth to prime to coming of age, his description exhausts every aspect—how perfectly a man may be as heir and successor! Today, when people see a young scion—radiant as jade, resplendent as coral—who does not love and admire him? Yet they do not know how he is nurtured in ease, refined and polished, nor how earnestly his heart is devoted. If by good fortune he becomes like Wu, joyful and without reproach, or like Xi, impartial and without suspicion, then between father and son, affection is as boundless as Heaven and Earth, illumination as bright as the sun and moon—how could it be merely a matter of one military command?

Yet observe the flourishing age of Jin: when Zhao Wenzhi was orphaned, he brought things to abundant completion; when Fan Wenzhi was retiring, he elevated reverence and deference. But in its decline, one like Bo Lu was at a loss for even a single word; another like Zhi Yao, though strong, overawed the Five Worthies. From this, one may see: not only is family fortune at stake, but the fate of the state truly hangs upon it.

Now that the realm is unified and worthy talent is shared in common, how can one fail to devote oneself to prior cultivation?

In the *Comprehensive Mirror*, Zhao Jianzi had two sons: the elder, Bo Lu, and the younger, Wu Xu. Wishing to establish an heir but uncertain whom to appoint, he wrote words of instruction on two tablets and gave them to his sons, commanding them, “Remember them well.” After two years, he questioned them. Bo Lu could not recall a single word; when he sought the tablet, he had already lost it. When he questioned Wu Xu, the latter recited the words with great familiarity; when he sought the tablet, he drew it from his sleeve and presented it. Thereupon Jianzi, deeming Wu Xu worthy, established him as heir.

It is recorded: Was Zhao Jianzi more worthy than Zhi Xuanzhi? The one who picked up the tablet in the night and the one who set it down—how vastly different were their fortunes! The *Yi* says: “Xu means to await. When peril lies ahead, if one is strong and does not fall, its meaning is not to be reduced to straits.” With Xiao’s ferocity written on his face and Yao’s ferocity lodged in his heart, could they not have waited and obtained it? The three families divided Jin, and their power could not coexist; yet they were obstinate and self-willed, falling into unrighteousness—how many days passed before their ruin?

Thus Shang Yang’s tablet was questioned only after three years—this is what is meant by “awaiting at the outskirts, advantage lies in constancy.” Wu Xu’s floodwaters were released only after three boards—this is what is meant by “awaiting at the blood, emerging from the cave.” The ancients’ preparedness for difficulty was thorough indeed; how clearly they sought their own fortune or misfortune!

When Qin attacked Zhao, the King of Zhao sought aid from Qi. Qi said, “You must send the Lord of Chang’an as hostage.” The Queen Dowager refused, and Qi’s army did not advance. The great ministers strongly remonstrated, but the Queen Dowager grew angry, saying, “If anyone again speaks of sending the Lord of Chang’an as hostage, I will surely spit in his face.” Then the Left Minister, Chu Long, wishing to see the Queen Dowager, entered with a fierce demeanor and awaited her. He advanced slowly and apologized, saying, “Your old servant’s feet are afflicted, and I have not been able to see you for a long time. I privately feared that Your Majesty’s person might be suffering.” The Queen Dowager said, “This old woman relies on a palanquin to get about.”

She then asked, “Has your appetite waned at all?”
He replied, “I sustain myself on porridge alone.”
Gradually, the displeasure on the Queen Dowager’s face softened. Then he said, “My youngest son, Shuqi, is the most unworthy, yet I secretly cherish and love him. I humbly wish to fill a vacancy among the Black Attire Guards to protect the royal palace.”
The Queen Dowager said, “Do men also dote on their youngest sons?”
He answered, “Even more than women do.”
The Queen Dowager laughed and said, “Women dote far more.”
He replied, “Your servant privately believes that Your Majesty’s love for the Princess of Yan surpasses that for the Lord of Chang’an.”
The Queen Dowager said, “You are mistaken. It does not compare to my love for the Lord of Chang’an.”
The Left Minister said, “When parents love their children, they plan for their long-term future. I have often heard how Your Majesty sent off the Princess of Yan, holding her heel and weeping, praying at every sacrifice that she would never be sent back. Was this not planning for her lasting welfare, ensuring that her descendants would continue to rule?”
The Queen Dowager said, “Indeed.”
The Left Minister continued, “Now, looking back three generations to the descendants of former Kings of Zhao who were enfeoffed as marquises—do any of their lines remain?”
She said, “None.”
He said, “This shows that misfortune befalls them sooner or later—either in their own lifetimes or in those of their descendants. Is it that the sons of rulers are inherently unworthy when enfeoffed? No. It is because they hold high rank without merit, enjoy lavish stipends without labor. Now, Your Majesty exalts the Lord of Chang’an, bestowing upon him fertile lands and abundant treasures, yet you do not require him to render service to the state. If, one day, the unforeseen should occur, how will the Lord of Chang’an secure his place in Zhao?”
The Queen Dowager said, “Very well. I leave him to your disposal.”
Thereupon, she prepared a hundred chariots for the Lord of Chang’an, who was sent as hostage to Qi. Qi then dispatched its army, and Qin withdrew.

The record states: The Left Minister’s enlightenment of the Queen Dowager and the Four Elders’ pacification of Emperor Hui are both recorded in the *Commentary on the Book of Changes* by Master Cheng of the Yi River. Is this truly the case?
It is not. The Left Minister’s remonstrance was unhurried and gentle, arising from affection and remembrance, never straying from his innate goodness. This is what is meant by “guiding with restraint through the side door to dispel a single deluded thought.” Empress Lü, however, used favors to coerce the virtuous, just as the virtuous later used the Four Elders to coerce the emperor. This is what is meant by “soaking a garment to meet an urgent need.” Alas!

Had any man ever held high office yet inspired the realm’s people to crane their necks, longing to die for the heir apparent? Thus the emperor’s compliance with goodness was as effortless as a turning wheel—this was the beauty of his inborn nature. Yet his responses to myriad affairs were often flawed and regrettable—this was the fault of his lack of learning.

The *Biographies of Exemplary Women* records: The mother of Sunshu Ao, prime minister of Chu, was the wife of the magistrate of Sun. When Sunshu Ao was a child, he went out to play and saw a two-headed snake. He killed and buried it, then returned home weeping. His mother asked the reason, and he replied: “I have heard that whoever sees a two-headed snake will die. Today I saw one while playing.” His mother asked: “Where is the snake now?” He answered: “I feared others might see it, so I killed and buried it.” His mother said: “You will not die. One who possesses hidden virtue receives manifest reward. Virtue overcomes misfortune, and benevolence dispels a hundred calamities. Heaven, though high, hears the lowly.” Does not the *Book of Documents* say: “August Heaven shows no partiality; it aids only those who possess virtue”? Be silent, and you will surely rise in Chu.

When he grew up and became prime minister, the noble-minded called Sunshu Ao’s mother one who understood the sequence of Dao and virtue. As the *Book of Songs* says: “The mother was sagely and good”—this is what it means.

The record states: How keen was Sunshu Ao’s mother in her discernment! The boy’s initial words were not necessarily pleasing, yet in a single turn, her bearing was transformed without need for deliberation. That the reward for hidden virtue would come to pass was not yet certain, but her sagely wisdom was unmatched in antiquity. This further confirms that the noble-minded in their intentions must never harm the people or destroy things. If he feared a single snake might bring harm again, how much more should one refrain from wanton violence?

Now consider the wife of Ma Fu Jun She, mother of Zhao Kuo. When Qin attacked Zhao, King Xiaocheng appointed Zhao Kuo as general. His mother said to the king: “Kuo must not be sent.” The king asked: “Why?” She replied: “When I first served his father, he was a general. Those to whom he personally offered meals numbered in the tens, and those he befriended in the hundreds. Whatever gifts of silk and coin the king and the royal clan bestowed, he gave entirely to his officers and soldiers. When they received their orders, they said: ‘Do not ask about household matters.’ Now Kuo, as general, sits stiffly facing forward at court, and none of the military officers dare look up at him. Whatever gold and silk he is given, he takes home and hoards, saying only to look for advantageous fields and estates to purchase. Do you think he is like his father? Father and son are not the same; their natures differ. I beg you not to send him.” The king said: “My decision is already made.” His mother said: “If you still send him, and he proves unworthy, I ask not to be implicated.” After Kuo departed, the Zhao army was indeed defeated, Kuo was killed, and the army was annihilated. Because his mother had forewarned the king, she was ultimately spared punishment.

The record states: That Zhao Kuo was unfit to be a general was known by his father and his mother—only the ruler was ignorant. At that time, the six states, mere wandering souls clinging to breath, brought about their own destruction. Thus they first lost the fundamental sense of right and wrong in their hearts, and in their haste for quick success, had no leisure to turn back and reflect. This is why Mencius deeply sighed: “When Heaven sends calamity, one may still avoid it; when man brings calamity upon himself, there is no escape.”

The *Book of Han* records: The mother of Chen Ying, Marquis of Tangyi. Initially, Ying was the magistrate of Dongyang, where he had long been kind to the people and was known as a man of integrity. During the reign of the Second Emperor of Qin, the young men of Dongyang killed the county magistrate and gathered in the thousands, seeking to appoint a leader. They requested Ying. Ying declined, saying he was incapable, but they insisted and made him their leader, intending to make him king. His mother said: “I have been a daughter-in-law in your family and know that our ancestors were never very noble. Now to suddenly gain such great fame is inauspicious. It would be better to place your troops under another. If the matter succeeds, you may still be enfeoffed as a marquis; if it fails, it will be easy to flee, and you will not be singled out by name.” Ying followed her advice and placed his troops under Xiang Liang, who made him a senior minister. After the Xiang clan was defeated, Ying later joined Han and was indeed enfeoffed as Marquis of Tangyi for his merits.

The mother of Wang Ling, Marquis of Anguo and Chancellor. Ling was originally a powerful figure in his county. When the High Ancestor was still obscure, Ling attended to him in all matters. When the High Ancestor rose in Pei, Ling also gathered a band of several thousand and later submitted to the King of Han, placing his troops under him. At the time, Xiang Yu was Han’s enemy. Having captured Ling’s mother, he placed her in his camp. When Ling’s envoys arrived, they were made to face his mother, who was bound and seated, in an attempt to lure Ling. Later, Ling’s mother sent off the envoys in tears, saying: “Tell Ling to serve the King of Han well. The King of Han is a man of integrity; do not, for my sake, harbor divided loyalties.” Having spoken, she fell upon her sword and died. Later, Ling helped the High Ancestor pacify the realm, rising to the position of Chancellor and being enfeoffed as a marquis. His title was passed down for five generations.

The record states: At this, Fan Zeng should have felt ashamed. That Xiang Yu was unfit to be assisted was known even by women and girls. Alas! This man of over seventy years in life was outdone in wisdom by Chen’s mother and in death was more despised than Wang’s mother. Had Fan Zeng been able to persuade Xiang Yu to honor the agreement to enter the Pass, and to maintain the boundary at Honggou, then the Xiang clan’s sacrifices would not have been cut off. Had he made clear the intent of Heaven’s decree and turned the swords of the dancing blades, he might still have retained the enfeoffment of Xiang Bo. Having lost both opportunities, was his wisdom truly inferior? Yet the insights of the two mothers were straightforward and easy, while Fan Zeng’s task was arduous and difficult. When a noble-minded man encounters times of hardship and adversity, he may be fortunate enough to be employed like these two sons, achieving the reputation of a worthy mother; or unfortunate enough to be like Fan Zeng, bearing the world’s blame in vain.

The *Records of the Historian* states: Zui Cuo was sharp-tongued, forthright, and severely exacting. During the reign of Emperor Wen, he was promoted to Household Administrator of the Heir Apparent for his proposals on expediency. His eloquence won him favor with the heir apparent, who called him the “Bag of Wisdom.” He frequently submitted memorials on reducing the power of the feudal lords and revising laws and ordinances. Emperor Wen did not heed them but admired his talent and promoted him to Palace Grandee.

The heir apparent favored Xiao Cuo’s strategies, and upon ascending the throne, appointed him as Internal Scribe. Xiao frequently sought private audiences to present his proposals, and the emperor invariably heeded them. His favor eclipsed that of the Nine Ministers, and many laws and ordinances were revised at his behest. Chancellor Shentu Jia found this intolerable and repeatedly plotted to execute Xiao, though his schemes failed. Xiao’s influence only grew, and he was promoted to Censor-in-Chief. He then thoroughly investigated the crimes and faults of the feudal lords, seizing their subsidiary commanderies. The thirty chapters of revised decrees he issued provoked an uproar among the lords.

Xiao’s father, hearing of this, traveled from Yingchuan and said to him: “Now that the emperor has newly ascended the throne, you, a distant relation, wield power and encroach upon the feudal lords. You estrange close kin and provoke widespread resentment. Why?” Xiao replied: “Indeed. Without such measures, the Son of Heaven would lack dignity, and the ancestral temples would be insecure.” His father said: “Alas! The House of Liu may be secure, but the House of Zuì will not.” He then took poison and died, declaring: “I cannot bear to witness the calamity that will befall you.” Ten days later, the seven kingdoms of Wu and Chu indeed rebelled.

**Recorded Remarks:** Observing the *Records of the Historian*, I note that two men were called “Bags of Wisdom,” yet each had his blind spots. Ning Li was blinded by Hu Qing, and Xiao Cuo by Yuan Ang. Could it be that they loved wisdom but not learning? Nevertheless, Xiao’s intent to curtail the feudal lords was nearly a case of “forgetting oneself for the sake of the state.” Yet he was executed in disgrace, becoming a laughingstock. Had he cherished his kin and esteemed his superiors, he might have preserved his life and retired to his estate in Zhang Terrace south of the Wei River. Emperor Jing of Han proved no match for King Zhao of Qin—this much is clear. As for Xiao’s father’s foresight, it may have come too late.

The mother of Yan Yannian, Governor of Henan, bore five sons, all of whom rose to the rank of Two Thousand Bushels. People called her “The Ten-Thousand-Bushel Matriarch.” Yan Yannian, as governor, was renowned for his severity and competence. In winter, he would summon prisoners from the subordinate counties to his headquarters for sentencing, their blood flowing for miles—hence his nickname, “The Butcher Governor.” His mother once traveled from Donghai to Luoyang and, upon witnessing this, was horrified. She stayed at the capital’s post station and refused to enter the governor’s residence. There, she reproached Yan Yannian, saying: “Fortunate to be a regional governor, you have not heard of governing with benevolence and righteousness to protect and pacify the people. Instead, you rely on punishments, slaughtering many to establish your authority. Is this the intent of one who would be a parent to the people? The Way of Heaven is spiritually luminous; one cannot kill with impunity. I never imagined I would live to see my own son executed.” She then departed, saying: “Go east and return home. I will only sweep the graves.” A year later, the Palace Assistant Secretary impeached Yan Yannian on over ten charges. The case was referred to the Censorate for investigation, and he was ultimately executed in the marketplace. The people of Donghai all praised his mother’s wisdom.

**Recorded Remarks:** Alas, how unlike the ancients was Yan’s mother! The ancients’ methods of prenatal instruction and the “Three Moves” were means by which worthy mothers nurtured this heart and fortified the defenses of benevolence. Had Yan’s mother carefully observed her son’s inclinations from the start, curbing his excesses and restraining his worst impulses, ensuring he cultivated the pure ways of his elders in childhood and embodied compassion in adulthood—had his heart lacked cruelty, even rewards would not have made him brutal. How could one dubbed “The Butcher Governor” have preserved his life? In truth, she suffered the grief of sweeping graves, while her reputation for wisdom was but an empty tale. How unlike the ancients was Yan’s mother! How lamentable.

The mother of Jun Buyi, Prefect of the Capital, was kind and wise in her teachings. When Jun served as prefect and returned from inspecting the counties and reviewing prisoners, his mother would always ask how many he had acquitted and spared. If Jun reported many acquittals, his mother would rejoice, her speech and appetite surpassing her usual demeanor. If he reported none, she would grow angry and refuse to eat. Thus, Jun conducted his duties with severity but without cruelty.

The noble-minded say of this mother: she may be called one who “eternally bestows blessings upon her kind.”

**Recorded Remarks:** In my humble view, Jun Buyi’s mother differed from Yan Yannian’s. The essence of teaching lies in foresight. Jun was no “Butcher Governor,” nor did his mother face the sorrow of sweeping graves. Her son earned a good name, and she bequeathed him blessings—was she not both enlightened and wise?

**The *Book of Later Han* states:** Wu You’s father, Wu Hui, served as Governor of Nanhai. At twelve, Wu You accompanied his father to the post. Wu Hui wished to burn the bamboo slips to transcribe the classics. Wu You remonstrated: “Now, sir, you have crossed the Five Ridges to this distant coastal region, where the customs are indeed coarse. Yet the land holds rare treasures, viewed with suspicion by the court above and coveted by powerful relatives below. If these books are completed, they will require a double cartload to transport. In the past, Ma Yuan was slandered for his ‘gray cocoons,’ and Wang Yang’s clothing sacks aroused suspicion—these were matters the former worthies took care to avoid.” Wu Hui desisted and, stroking his son’s head, said: “The House of Wu will not lack its own Ji Zha!”

As Wu You grew, he possessed keen insight into character. After being nominated as Filial and Incorrupt, he served as Chancellor of Jiaodong. He led by example, and his subordinates could not bear to deceive him. The bailiff Sun Xing privately levied funds from the people to buy clothes for his father. Upon receiving them, the father grew angry and urged his son to return and confess. Sun Xing, trembling with fear, went to the government office, clutching the clothes, and confessed. Wu You said: “You endured humiliation for your father’s sake—this is what is meant by ‘observing faults to know virtue.’” He sent Sun Xing home to apologize to his father and returned the clothes to him.

**Recorded Remarks:** In this light, Zhao Guanghan’s “hook-and-line” interrogations and Zhang Xu’s “floss-trailing” tactics were unnecessary. This was a clarity of innate nature, wisdom that required no instruction. Let this be recorded.

From *The Book of Jin*:

Tao Kan’s father, Dan, served the Kingdom of Wu as General of Yangwu. His mother, née Zhan, was a concubine who bore Tao Kan. The Tao family was poor, and Zhan spun hemp to provide for her son, enabling him to associate with those superior to himself. When the Filial and Incorrupt Candidate of Poyang, Fan Da, lodged with Tao Kan, a great snow fell. Zhan cut off her hair and sold it to obtain a pair of tresses, which she exchanged for wine and delicacies. They drank merrily, and even the servants were treated beyond their expectations. When the feast ended, she lay on firewood to keep warm and personally fed the horses.

Later, Tao Kan was appointed Supervisor of the Yuanliang Canal in Deyang. He sent his mother a jar of salted fish as a gift. She returned it with a rebuke: “You send me official goods—this not only brings no benefit but only increases my worries.” When Fan Da heard of this, he sighed and said, “Without such a mother, this son could not have been born.” He recommended Tao Kan to Zhang Kui, the Prefect of Lujiang, who then employed him. Later, through military merit, Tao Kan became Prefect of Jiangxia and was promoted to General of Soaring Hawk. He prepared an honor guard to welcome his mother, bringing glory to his hometown.

Zhou Yi’s father, Jun, was General of the East for Pacification. A man of keen judgment, he once went hunting and was caught in the rain, taking shelter at the home of Li, styled Luoxiu. At the time, her father and brothers were away. Hearing that a nobleman had arrived, Luoxiu and a maid slaughtered pigs and sheep inside the house, preparing a feast for dozens with great care—yet no other voices were heard. Suspicious, Jun sent someone to investigate and saw only a single, exceptionally beautiful woman. He sought her as a concubine, but her father and brothers refused. Luoxiu said, “Our family is poor and struggling—why惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜一女? If we form an alliance with a noble family, it may bring great benefit in the future.” They consented. She bore three sons—Ji, Song, and Mo—all of whom rose to eminent positions.

On one Winter Solstice, she prepared wine and, raising her cup, addressed her three sons: “When I first crossed the river, I had nowhere to set foot. Who could have imagined that I would be embraced by a distinguished clan and that you would all attain high rank before my eyes? What more could I wish for?” Song rose and said, “We fear we may fall short of your expectations.”

Lady Ji was ambitious but lacked ability; his reputation was great, yet his judgment flawed. To ride another’s worn-out steed is no way to preserve oneself. Song’s nature was unyielding and upright, and thus he could not be tolerated by the world. Only Asnu, mediocre and unremarkable, would remain beneath his mother’s gaze. (Asnu was Mo’s childhood name.) Later events unfolded exactly as she had foretold.

**Record states:** Observing the mothers of Tao Shixing and Zhou Boren, one may call them perceptive and discerning. Both arose from humble origins to become concubines, their status by no means tied to their世 lineage. Yet some may harbor doubts regarding the cutting of hair and the preparation of the feast. How much could a single lock of hair be worth, that she could drink with such joy and merriment? How could a frail young girl, in haste and alone, manage the slaughter and butchery of so many beasts? Was it rather that her virtuous reputation had long been known, so that even when it came to cutting her hair, none would dare refuse? That her skill in preparation was so renowned that even should the task require the labor of several, she would not decline? And thus, was this later taken as fact? As for descending into the depths of Song’s imprisonment and inscribing his name among the state’s pillars, though it may seem the work of human design, the will of Heaven was truly at play—beyond all measure or conjecture.

*Hongdao Record, Volume 41, concludes*
*Hongdao Record, Volume 42: Wisdom*

**On the Wisdom of Father and Son**

From *The Old Book of Tang*: In the summer of the twenty-third year of the Zhenguan era, the fourth month, Emperor Taizong fell ill. He addressed the Crown Prince, saying: "Li Shiji possesses abundant talent and wisdom, yet you share no bond of gratitude with him—he cannot be made to submit willingly. I shall now demote him. If he departs at once, then after my death, you may later appoint him as Chancellor and entrust him with authority. But if he lingers or hesitates, you must put him to death." Thereupon, Li was appointed Chief Minister and concurrently Governor of Diezhou. Shiji received the decree and departed without returning home.

**Recorded Note:** How fitting that Emperor Taizong could not protect his son, much less his grandson! The command to entrust the orphaned heir had not yet been issued, yet the words to entrust Li Shiji had already taken root—this was how he taught his son to set a trap. The emperor, by nature, relied on calculation and stratagem, excelling in employing men but lacking discernment in judging them. Thus, today’s trusted confidant would become tomorrow’s sworn enemy; today’s clever scheme would become tomorrow’s root of disaster. He believed himself shrewd, yet failed to see that one who betrays his former lord would not hesitate to betray a secret trust. At first, he acted solely to sever a single strand of hair for the sake of the state, unaware that the nature of hawks and hounds cannot be measured by such small favors. In the end, he resorted to the same cunning that had once removed a rival, hoping to secure the distant future of the Liu clan—how grievously misguided! This matter bears heavily upon the ancestral temples and altars of the Tang; it cannot go unrecorded.

In the first year of Emperor Ruizong’s reign, the court prepared to establish the Crown Prince. Though Prince Song, Chengqi, was the eldest legitimate son, Prince Ping, Longji, had rendered great service, leaving the emperor uncertain. Chengqi declined, saying: "When the state is at peace, precedence belongs to the eldest legitimate heir; when the state is in peril, precedence belongs to the one with merit. To defy this principle would dash the hopes of the realm. Though I die, I dare not stand above Prince Ping." For days, he wept and firmly refused, while many ministers also urged that Prince Ping’s merits made him the rightful choice. Liu Youqiu declared: "He who eradicates the realm’s calamities shall enjoy its blessings. The prince rescued the state from danger and saved his sovereign and kin from peril—no merit is greater, no virtue more exemplary. There is no cause for doubt." The emperor relented and named Prince Ping, Longji, as Crown Prince.

**Recorded Note:** All say that the restoration of Prince Luling marked the Tang’s second founding, yet none realize that the true founding lay in Prince Ping, Longji, being named Crown Prince. Now, Zhen was the eldest son. Yet Jiancheng, Chengqian, and Prince Chen, Zhong, were all mediocre and unworthy—mere trembling shadows, doomed to perish. As for Emperor Zhongzong, his folly was even more extreme: at first, he endured humiliation without regard, then suffered deposition without shame; in the end, he lived in constant anxiety yet remained oblivious, ruled by his wife and eunuchs without concern—truly a shadow lost in the mire, devoid of light. But when Emperor Xuanzong arose in majestic wrath, startling the realm, the hearts of the wicked were laid bare, and the accumulated yin of the age gave way to the spirit of the Divine Yao. Thus, the old order was not lost. As the saying goes: "The thunderclap shakes a hundred li, yet the sacrificial ladle remains unharmed"—such a one may guard the ancestral temples and altars, serving as the master of rites. The proof lies in what followed.

Quan Gao was the father of Quan Deyu, chief minister of the Tang. Renowned for his talent, he was appointed as an aide to An Lushan’s tyranny. Secretly planning to flee, he feared that uncovering An’s treasonous designs would bring disaster upon his aged mother. When An sent him to present captives in the capital, Gao passed through Fuchang on his return. The magistrate, Zhong Mou—Gao’s cousin by marriage—privately devised a plan with him. Upon reaching Heyang, Gao feigned grave illness and summoned Mou. When Mou arrived, Gao staged a display of grief and lamentation. An Lushan, thus deceived, permitted Gao’s mother to return home. Gao then disguised himself, concealed his tracks, and awaited his mother at Qimen. Escorting her day and night, they fled south. By the time they crossed the Yangtze, An Lushan had already rebelled, and Gao’s name resounded throughout the realm. The Investigating Censor Gao Shi recommended him as an adjutant. When Prince Yong, Lin, stirred rebellion and seized many officials, Gao changed his name to evade capture. Emperor Xuanzong, then in Shu, heard of his deeds and praised him. Gentlemen of learning such as Li Hua and Liu Shi revered Gao’s virtue, declaring him the sole arbiter of good and evil in the world.

De Yu, at four, could compose poetry; by seven, he was already filial and refined. At fifteen, he had written hundreds of essays, and his reputation grew daily. Han Hui appointed him as an aide, and he later passed the examination in the Secretariat. Eventually, he became Minister of Rites and Chief Minister. From the Zhenyuan era to the third year of the Yuanhe era—thirty years—he stood as a paragon of the court. Upright, candid, magnanimous, and forgiving, his every word and deed bore no pretense. His grace and refinement were celebrated in his time. His writings were especially prolific, steeped in the Six Classics and the hundred schools. His prose was elegant, correct, expansive, and profound, earning him the title of master among his contemporaries.

**Recorded Note:** Though Quan Gao’s entanglement in the den of rebels may seem a lapse in judgment, he ultimately preserved himself to serve his mother—securing not only his integrity and reputation but also ensuring the prosperity of his descendants. Han Hui and Wang Dingchang’s assessment that Gao was fit to be a chief minister or imperial tutor was no empty praise. Father and son, steadfast in culture, filial piety, and virtue, stood as exemplars of the court—were they not men of profound wisdom?

Fu Lingqi’s son, Lin, initially served as a general in Youzhou. When chaos erupted in the region, he fled to Zhaoyi. Tian Yue defied imperial orders, and Lingqi secretly advised Lin: "I have witnessed much of the world. Since the An Lushan rebellion, no rebel faction has survived. I see that the Tian clan’s downfall is imminent. If you pledge loyalty to the court and become a faithful minister of the Tang, my name will also be honored by posterity." Lin wept and replied: "Yue is a ruthless man—his impending doom is terrifying." Lingqi said: "Now, the royal armies converge from all sides. We are like fish in a cauldron. If you do not act, I shall die beneath the ramparts of the rebels. What then?"

Lin clasped his father’s arm in farewell. At that time, the court had dispatched Ma Qiong to suppress Yue, and Lin surrendered. Enraged, Yue berated him bitterly for betraying loyalty and abandoning his lord, declaring, "You shall die at dawn—what use is regret now?" The imperial edict appointed Lin as *Tejin*. Lingqi said, "I taught you to follow the Way of obedience—yet now you face death for killing Sui." Later, Sui’s forces appointed Lin as deputy commander. Another man, Yi Zhang, had long observed Zhao Yuanhao and knew he would rebel; he was enfeoffed as Prince of Yiyang Commandery, and his petition redressed his father’s grievances, earning him the titles of Left *Sanqi Changshi* and Minister of Revenue.

**Recorded Note:** This affair parallels that of Quan Gao. Had Lingqi truly died, Gao’s survival would have been but a pretense. Yet history omits such exemplary conduct—could it be because his son never rose to the rank of minister? Let this be recorded.

In *The History of the Song*, Cao Zan and Cao Wei were both sons of Cao Bin. Zan was steadfast, resolute, and shrewd; Bin saw himself in him and doted on him, appointing him Military Commissioner of Heyang and *Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi*. Wei was courageous, strategic, and fond of reading, particularly the *Three Commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals*, with especial mastery of the *Zuo Tradition*. When Li Jiqian rebelled, the generals sent to suppress him repeatedly failed. Emperor Taizong asked who could lead the campaign, and Bin replied, "My youngest son, Wei, is capable." Summoned to court, Wei was appointed *Tong Zhi* of Weizhou at the age of nineteen. When Bin fell gravely ill, Emperor Zhenzong visited him and inquired about his final wishes. Bin replied, "I have no concerns to voice—only that my two sons possess talents worth employing. If I may recommend from within my family, both are fit to be generals." The emperor asked which was superior, and Bin answered, "Zan is not Wei’s equal." Later, Wei’s merits earned him a place alongside Bin in the ancestral temple. Bin was honored by Emperor Taizu; Wei, by Emperor Renzong—truly, no one knows a son like his father.

**Recorded Note:** Bin’s preference for Wei—could it have been foresight that he would not ally with Ding Wei? Thus, it is better to be a partisan of Kou than of Wei. Though a partisan of Kou may be condemned, he remains honorable, for he bears no shame before Heaven. Though a partisan of Wei may rise high, he is still executed, for he wears a face of hypocrisy. Is this not a pillar of the state and a guardian of justice in the realm?

Wei once observed Zhao Yuanhao and, knowing he would rebel, told the Chief Military Affairs Commissioner, Wang Zong: "While in Shaanxi, I heard that Zhao Deming often sent men to barter horses. Enraged by meager profits, he once sought to kill a trader, but none dared dissuade him. At the time, Yuanhao was barely over ten years old. He remonstrated, 'We are a people of the saddle and horse, yet we trade our resources to neighboring states for frivolous goods—this is already poor strategy. To kill the trader on top of it—who among the borderlands will serve us then?' Deming heeded his advice."

Zhuang privately thought to himself: "This son seeks to employ such men—he must harbor rebellious intentions." He had heard that Yuanhao often frequented the military markets, and wishing to recognize him, repeatedly sent men to lure him, but to no avail. He then dispatched a skilled painter to capture his likeness for observation. Truly a remarkable figure—one day he would become a scourge along the frontier. Calculating the time, this was precisely when Wang Zong held office. Wang had greatly encouraged Zhuang, though at the time he did not agree; only later did he sigh in admiration at Zhuang’s foresight.

The record states: This was not merely a case of Tan falling short of Zhuang’s judgment, but even the discussions at the time were misguided. Bin could truly be said to have remained steadfast in his recommendations from beginning to end.

Xiang Minzhong’s father, Li, personally oversaw his education, sparing no leniency, and declared: "This child will bring greatness to our family." As he grew, Minzhong possessed a dignified and imposing bearing, was affable and wise, understood governance, and excelled at managing complex affairs. Having borne great responsibilities for thirty years, he was regarded by all as a man of profound virtue. The sovereign held him in high esteem, and though he endured trials, he was never dismissed from office. Once, he was promoted to Right Vice Director of the Chancellery and concurrent Attendant of the Gate of the Bureau of Scrutiny. Emperor Zhenzong said to Academician Li Zongkuo: "Since my ascension, I have never appointed a Vice Director of the Chancellery. Today I appoint Minzhong—this is an exceptional decree." Minzhong should have been overjoyed, and well-wishers would surely gather. "Go observe him," the emperor instructed, "but do not reveal my intent." When Zongkuo arrived, the gates were quiet. He entered to offer congratulations, saying: "Today, upon hearing of the imperial decree, all officials and scholars are both awed and delighted." Minzhong merely murmured in assent. Zongkuo continued: "Since the emperor’s enthronement, no one has been appointed to this post. Your merit and prestige are unmatched, and the emperor’s favor is extraordinary—how has this come to pass?" Minzhong again murmured in assent. Zongkuo then recounted the illustrious deeds and honors of past Vice Directors of the Chancellery, but Minzhong still only murmured in assent, uttering not a single word. His prudence and discretion were ever thus.

He had five sons: Chuan Zheng, Chuan Shi, Chuan Liang, Chuan Shi, and Chuan Fan. Chuan Liang’s son, Jing, had a daughter who became Empress Qinsheng Xiansu. Later, Minzhong was posthumously enfeoffed as Prince of Yan, Chuan Liang as Prince of Zhou, and Jing as Prince of Wu. Their descendants all rose to prominence.

The record states: Among the consort clans of the Song, some were known for benevolence, others for wisdom, and others for courage. Benevolent yet not excessive, wise yet not cunning, courageous yet not reckless. Thus, Bin’s integrity and humility were free from excess; Minzhong’s affability and wisdom were free from cunning; and Qiong...

Though unaware of this principle, seeking only through beauty and charm—how could one hope for fourteen sons, all taught to read, thus preserving the blessings of conjugal harmony and the excellence of posterity?

Lu Yijian and his son Gongzhuo were both appointed Grand Mentor and Grand Councilor. Since the founding of the Song, only four men had held the concurrent titles of the Three Dukes and Grand Councilor, and two of them were from the Lü clan. Scholars marveled at their glory.

Yijian’s father, Mengheng, was the younger brother of Mengzheng. During the Xiangfu era, when Emperor Zhenzong made his imperial progress to Mount Tai and visited Mengzheng’s residence, he asked, “Which of your sons is fit for office?” Mengzheng replied, “None of my sons are worthy, but I have a nephew, Yijian, who has the talent to be Grand Councilor.” From that moment, Yijian’s name was known.

From youth, Gongzhuo took the cultivation of the heart and nurturing of nature as his foundation. He remained indifferent to the clamor of fame and profit, unmoved by worldly splendor. In summer, he did not wave a fan; in winter, he did not warm himself by the fire. His manner was simple, grave, and serene—such was his natural endowment. His intelligence and insight were keen, and he excelled at making decisions. If something benefited the state, he was unmoved by personal gain or loss. When he met scholar-officials who took an interest in talent, he would inquire about their knowledge, cross-referencing what they knew with what he had heard to verify the truth, then reporting it to the throne. In deliberating policy, he broadly adopted the best suggestions from all sides.

Emperor Shenzong once remarked, “In matters of talent, he is never deceptive—like a scale weighing objects. He is especially adept at keeping his distance from fame and reputation, never presuming to claim credit for discerning others.” Sima Guang also said, “Whenever I hear Huishu speak, I feel my own words are superfluous.” Such was the esteem in which he was held.

The record states: In my view, not only did Lord Wenmu of the Lü clan recognize Yijian’s worth, but so did Wang Wenzheng. Observe how a single word from him could decide matters—even divination by tortoise shell or milfoil could not compare. This is what is meant by “intertwined stalks of grass, their kind portending good fortune.” As for Zhixian, though he said, “In talent, he is never deceptive, like a scale weighing objects,” he had not yet seen its efficacy in practice—still, he was one who “embraced both honor and shame.” Here, human affairs intersect with the Dao of Heaven, and the distinction between rise and fall, success and failure, is clearly evident.

Su Xun named his two sons *Shuo* and *Shi*. Of *Shuo*, he said: “The wheel, spokes, and axle all have their functions, as does the carriage itself—but *Shi* alone seems to do nothing.” Yet if *Shi* were removed, I would not consider the carriage complete. *Shi*, I fear you will not balance inner and outer. All carriages in the world follow the ruts, yet when praising the carriage’s merit, the ruts are not mentioned. Nevertheless, if the carriage overturns or the horse dies, the misfortune does not extend to the ruts. Thus, the ruts lie between fortune and misfortune. *Shi*, I now understand.

In *Record of the Wooden Mountain*, he wrote: My family has three peaks. Whenever I reflect on them, I suspect some fate governs their existence. Though gnarled, they are not harmed; though towering, they are not felled. Used as beams, they are not cut down; uprooted by wind or swept away by water, they do not break. Unharmed, unrotted, unbroken, yet not deemed useful by others—only after enduring the axe’s edge and emerging from the rapids’ sands, untouched by woodcutters or rustics as firewood, do they attain their present state. This seems no mere coincidence. Yet my love for them is mingled with deeper feeling.

I see the central peak, majestic and unconstrained, its bearing dignified and weighty, as if commanding the two flanking peaks. Those two are solemn, stern, and sharply defined, formidable and untouchable. Though their power submits to the central peak, they stand aloof, as if disdaining attachment. Alas, how admirable! How moving!

The record states: Historians say that *Shi* slightly restrained himself, and though he never gained power, he thus avoided disaster. Could this truly be so? Observe how Old Su foresaw his son’s fate with unerring precision, and how his analogy of the three peaks is so vivid and apt that, even a thousand years later, one can imagine the intimacy of that household, the depth of understanding between father and son—how could their wisdom be compared to the ordinary man’s cursory knowledge of his children?

Ouyang Xiu lost his father in childhood. His mother, Lady Zheng of the State of Han, personally taught him to read. Poor and without resources, she used reeds to trace characters in the earth, instructing him thus: “Your father was an official. Often, he would work late into the night by candlelight, repeatedly setting aside his brush with a sigh. When I asked why, he said, ‘A case involving a capital sentence. I sought a way to spare the condemned, but could not.’ I said...”

"Could one seek to spare a life?"
"Yes. If one seeks to spare a life but fails, then both the condemned and I will have no regrets. If, by seeking, one sometimes succeeds, then one knows that those who die without such effort are indeed beyond saving. To constantly seek to spare life and yet still err in sentencing to death—how much worse, then, is it to constantly seek death?"

Ouyang Xiu took these words to heart for the rest of his life. In all cases involving capital punishment, unless the crime was murder, he often overturned the sentence. Even in private, when instructing other young men, he would repeat these words.

**Recorded thus:** Ouyang Xiu’s father did not act out of self-interest; he simply exhausted his own conscience. His mother, too, did not act for any personal gain; she merely illuminated her husband’s resolve. This is something others could not understand, yet she alone knew it. In the unseen realm, no hidden virtue surpasses this. Thus, one need not explicitly speak of karmic retribution—merely to hold these words in reverence for a lifetime is already a lesson worthy of the wise.

Liu Anshi’s mother was renowned for her wisdom. When Anshi was appointed to the post of remonstrance official, he had not yet assumed the position. He entered to inform his mother, saying: "The court, not deeming me unworthy, has placed me in a position to speak truth to power. If I hold this office, I must act with bold clarity, bearing full responsibility. Should I offend, punishment will follow swiftly. The emperor now governs by filial piety—if I decline on account of my aged mother, I may be excused."

His mother replied: "It is not so. I have heard that a remonstrance official is the emperor’s loyal critic. Your father longed to hold such a post but never had the chance. Now that you are fortunate enough to occupy this position, you must risk your life to repay the nation’s grace. Even if you are exiled for your crimes, no matter the distance, I will follow you."

Thus, Anshi accepted the appointment and served with unwavering integrity. He stood firm in court, openly challenging authority, earning the nickname "the tiger of the hall."

**Recorded thus:** Observing Anshi’s deeds, I sigh that life and death are fated, and a gentleman must accept his lot. With the power of a minister like Dun Bian and the cruelty of a tyrant, many would willingly submit. Yet not only did exile to the southern frontier fail to claim lives, but reprieves often arrived after repeated petitions—some dying just before pardon, others spared after traveling only a few post stations. Later generations hearing of this would merely scoff. As if some unseen force willed it so! Had his mother fretted over danger and urged caution, the path of integrity would not have shone so brightly. Without that integrity, the virtue of mother and son would have remained obscure. Their hesitation and restraint could never compare to the unashamed boldness of facing the world with open eyes.

Chen Tuan’s mother was Lady Chen. When Tuan sat for the imperial examination, one of the policy questions called for the punishment of the Yuanyou-era ministers, offering them a chance to redeem themselves by governing a prefecture. The emperor, however, feared their departure and refused. Emperor Renzong once remarked to his attendants: "All the Confucians have been employed—only Yu Bogsheng remains unpromoted."

When Emperor Yingzong ascended the throne, Baizhu, then chancellor, spoke to the emperor and dispatched envoys to summon him. Bogsheng, citing mourning, returned home. The censor Zhao Shian seized the opportunity to petition: "Bogsheng has long resided in the capital in dire poverty and suffers from an eye ailment. It would be merciful to grant him an external post for medical treatment."

The emperor grew angry: "Yu Bogsheng—do you all not tolerate him?" At the time, the emperor favored literary men. Bogsheng’s vast learning and broad knowledge made him indispensable, which is why the emperor so reluctantly allowed his departure.

**Recorded thus:** That women of old read and grasped grand principles is well-documented. Yet even the *Zuozhuan* and the prose of Ouyang Xiu and Su Shi remain challenging for today’s scholars—how much more so for women? In the *Records of the Historian*, when Wen Zhong governed Hengyang, the Ji couple followed him. They prayed to the Southern Marchmount for a son, and thus Bogsheng was born, and Wen Zhong marveled at him.

Alas! The birth of a child is rooted in their *qi*. Ji was discerning in character, steeped in Confucian tradition, while Yang’s wisdom and virtue were unblemished by worldly conduct. With such a worthy match, their descendants were bound to be exceptional. A wise observer could foresee their accomplishments without relying on dreams or divination.

From the *Imperial Literary Collection: Edict to Xuiping Marquis Mu Ying*:
"Rewarding merit with noble rank is the established system of emperors and kings. Longing for kin and cherishing old bonds are the natural sentiments of humanity. In the chaos of those years, I was already twenty-five and still childless. You, Mu Ying, suffered hardship in war at the age of eight, orphaned and unaware of survival. I pitied your youth and raised you as my own son. We slept side by side at night, and you often snored in my arms. Later, when I had sons of my own and you had grown, considering human nature and heavenly principle, I did not obscure your name but allowed you to reclaim your surname and worship your ancestors. Today, I still recall your childhood innocence and how I treated you no differently than my own father. Thus, I now enfeoff you as Xuiping Marquis. You must remember our first meeting and the great mercy of your deliverance. Strive to repay this boundless grace, dedicating yourself to the welfare of others, and you shall enjoy endless blessings and good fortune."

**Recorded thus:** In my view, Xuiping Marquis was no different from Liu Fei of Han. Yet Fei perished soon after, while Mu endured to this day—why? Without witnessing the case of Qi, one cannot understand the flaws of Han law; without observing the imperial clan, how can one appreciate the virtue of the Ming founder? At first, his care and upbringing were no different from the love for a biological heir. In the end, his impartiality and justice never concealed his past affection. Moreover, he allowed Mu to restore his surname and ancestral rites, avoiding not only the usurpation of kings and lords but also clearly upholding the principle of rewarding merit with rank. This was the great wisdom of an emperor, the great impartiality of heavenly principle—preserved for ten thousand generations without flaw. How could it not endure as long as heaven and share the prosperity of the nation? Even the most eloquent ministers and persuasive scholars need not add a word. Such imperial decrees and rescripts must be recorded.

From *Chen Yi’s Record of Cultivated Virtue*:
When Academician Xie Jin was commanded to inscribe the *Tiger Gazing at Its Cubs* painting, he wrote:
"The tiger is the lord of beasts—who dares provoke its wrath?"

Only the bond of father and son—
with every step, a backward glance.
Emperor Wen had long disliked Renzong,
yet moved by this poem, he yearned deeply.
At the time, Renzong was stationed in the Southern Capital,
his heart heavy with foreboding.
Thus, he dispatched his trusted minister Xia Yuanji
to hasten and welcome him home.

*Recorded thus*: In my humble view, this poem surpasses Zhang Liang’s stratagems by far. For the love between father and son is a bond of heavenly nature, unlike the schemes of rival states’ ministers. Rival states divide into self and other, calculating gains like mere objects; but father and son arise from the heart’s sincerity, their affection profound and irrepressible. The Han founder, swayed by his ministers’ counsel, could not advance his grand design. But Mingzong, guided by the benevolence of his innate nature, discerned the subtle admonition—this, for ages to come, may be observed.

Since the raising of troops by conscription and recruitment alike,
all matters were left to his discretion.
Even when meritorious, he was not hastily transferred,
but rather promoted in rank with distinction.
Thus, men of talent vied to exert themselves,
and in times of crisis, their utmost loyalty could be relied upon.

At the time, court discussions turned to military campaigns,
but you argued repeatedly against reckless action.
Later, when the Three Capitals were reclaimed
and the Jin forces freshly defeated,
the three frontier commanders were rewarded with higher ranks.
Yet you knit your brow and said:
“The borderlands have no one to depend upon.
I beg you to cast aside rigid constraints,
select and promote the outstanding—
men like Wu Yong, Zhou Yu, Lu Su,
or the ancients Ren Renfa, Zu Ti, and Tao Kan—
and assign each to a region,
entrusting them with command over dozens of cities.
Grant them full authority,
whether in Bashu, Jingxiang, or the two Huaidong regions,
to act with complete discretion.
Then, with flexibility at their command
and strategy springing from their own minds,
they may respond as needed.”
The court did not heed your counsel.
Twenty years later, Henan indeed fell to the Jin,
the power of border prefectures was greatly diminished,
and no one was willing to take responsibility for military affairs.
Soon after, Luoyang’s forces were defeated,
and the court at last acknowledged your foresight.

*Recorded thus*: In my humble view, these two men served during the perilous reigns of Emperors Guang and Ning, when Han Tuozhou held power, enduring factional strife and closing their doors in confusion. From youth to old age, they never set aside their books. They once remarked that Han Fei and Li Si, though endowed with Xun Qing’s talent, were debased by the world for their craving of wealth, honor, and profit. Only Xun Qing preserved his integrity, refusing to seek favor through flattery—how can a scholar fail to value himself?

They also said: “What allows external things to disturb the five senses and five desires, clouding the mind’s clarity, is the failure to grasp the principle of steadfast unity and tranquility. If one attains it, then sound and beauty cannot penetrate, riches and treasures cannot sway, fame and glory cannot move. Serene and unshaken, what can assail them?” From this, we see they were truly enlightened scholars of their age. Alas, their talents were never put to use.

*Recorded.*

From *The History of the Liao Dynasty*:

Yizong Bei, the eldest son of Abaoji, was intelligent and studious from childhood, outwardly magnanimous yet inwardly sincere. In the first year of the Shence era, he was named Crown Prince. When Taizu passed away, Bei, knowing the Empress Dowager favored De Guang, joined the ministers in petitioning the Empress Dowager to yield the throne. He declared: “The Grand Marshal’s virtue and power are vast, and all within and beyond the realm look to him—he is fit to rule the state.” Thereupon, the Grand Marshal ascended the imperial throne, becoming Taizong.

After Taizong’s enthronement, he established Dongping as the Southern Capital and relocated Bei there. He ordered Wang Jiyuan to select and erect the Southern Capital Stele. Bei, in turn, built a library in the Western Palace and composed poems on music, fields, and gardens. When Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang learned of this, he dispatched envoys across the sea with a secret letter summoning Bei. Bei reflected: “I yielded the realm, yet the sovereign now suspects me. Better to depart for another land and fulfill the renown of Wu Taibo.” He boarded a ship with the letter and set sail. Later Tang received him with celestial regalia; Bei sat in the ship’s hall as officials lined the shores in attendance.

Upon arriving in Bian, Mingzong bestowed upon Bei the surname Dongdan and the name Muhua. He renamed Ruizhou as Huaihua Commandery and appointed Bei as its Military Commissioner, concurrently appointing him as Surveillance Commissioner over Duanshen and other prefectures, later transferring him to Huazhou. Though residing in a foreign land, Bei never ceased longing for his kin, and his envoys to Taonan remained unbroken.

A record states: The Liao Crown Prince Bei may indeed be said to have known how to cherish his own integrity. Yet it is lamentable that he admired the renown of Wu Taibo but did not seek his resolve, emulated the footsteps of Ji Zha but failed to grasp his intent. The verses of *Xiaoshan* verge on resentment and folly; his acceptance of governorship was driven by a thirst for reputation; the surname Dongdan bespoke a lapse in remembering his roots. As for the one who granted him the name Muhua—his father in rebellion, his son in defiance—where lay the reverence and harmony implied in "Muhua" and "Huaihua"? In the end, it was but a path trodden among the barbarians.

*Hongdao Lu*, Scroll Forty-Three: Wisdom.

The Wisdom of Husband and Wife

From the *Family Sayings of Confucius*: Shuliang He of Lu took a wife from the Shi clan, who bore him nine daughters but no sons; his concubine gave birth to Meng Pi, who suffered from a foot ailment. Shuliang He said, "Though I have nine daughters, none are fit to inherit—this is as good as having no son." He then sought a marriage alliance with the Yan clan. The Yan family had three daughters, the youngest named Zheng Zai. Their father asked them, "Zou’s grand minister, though his father and grandfather were ministers of state, is descended from the ancient sages. Now the man himself stands nine *chi* tall, with unmatched martial prowess. Though he is advanced in years and stern in temperament, these are no cause for doubt. Which of you three would be willing to be his wife?" The two elder daughters made no reply, but Zheng Zai stepped forward and said, "I will follow whatever my father decides—what need is there to ask?" Her father said, "Then you shall do." And so he gave her to him in marriage.

The record states: Sima Qian’s judgments often deviate from those of the sages—how could this be mere error? His fabrications are extreme. That the *Family Sayings* should follow the *Analects* is itself evidence enough—why then does he treat it with such contempt? Zheng Zai took it upon herself to be worthy and sagely, a claim unheard of in ancient times. Yet he calls her union a "wild coupling" and even suggests that her son doubted his father’s burial site, forcing his mother to conceal the truth. Could this be so? Could this be so?

Some say: In Sima Qian’s time, the *Family Sayings* had not yet appeared. Yet by the time of Zheng Qiao’s *Comprehensive Records*, the text was already in circulation. Though he corrected Sima Qian’s errors, he still failed to include Zheng Zai’s story—little better than the original.

From the *Analects*: The Master said of Gongye Chang, "He may be given a wife. Though he was once imprisoned, it was not for any crime of his." And so he gave him his daughter in marriage. The Master said of Nan Rong, "When the state follows the Dao, he will not be cast aside; when it strays from the Dao, he will escape execution and punishment." And so he gave him his elder brother’s daughter in marriage.

The record states: Foolish as I am, I observe that among Confucius’ female disciples, why were they so preoccupied with imprisonment, execution, and punishment? The way of a wife is to follow her husband. Her fortune or misfortune, honor or disgrace, are tied to him for life—her hopes for a worthy husband are most earnest. Thus, she wishes only to grow old hand in hand with him, yet deeply fears parting midway. Even the sages could not help but be moved by such concerns. If this is the lesson, then in Lu there were those who killed their wives to seek military command, and those who mocked their wives for accepting bribes. Who would say that the marriages of these two men should not serve as models for later generations?

From the *Biographies of Exemplary Women*: The wife of Liu Xia Hui, a grand minister of Lu. Though Hui was dismissed from office three times, he refused to leave, grieving for the people and rescuing them from chaos. His wife said, "Is this not excessive? A gentleman has two sources of shame: to be honored when the state lacks the Dao, and to be lowly when it follows the Dao. Now, in this age of disorder, you have been dismissed three times yet remain—what good does it do?" Hui replied, "When the people are drowning in turmoil, how can I stand by? Let them be as they are; I will be as I am. Even if they stripped naked before me, how could they defile me?" And so he remained among them, unshaken.

After Hui’s death, his disciples wished to compose a eulogy. His wife said, "You do not know him as I do." Then she recited:
*"Unboastful was my husband,
Unwearied was my husband,
True and sincere, he harmed no one.
Yielding and adaptable, he did not force his judgment.
Though humble, he saved the people—his virtue grew ever greater.
Though dismissed, he was never obscured.
Oh, joyful and steadfast, ever able to refine himself!"*
The posthumous name "Hui" was fitting, and his disciples followed her words, unable to alter a single character.

The wife of Master Qian Lou of Lu. When the master died, Zengzi and his disciples went to offer condolences. His wife came to the door, and Zengzi entered the hall. There lay the master’s body beneath the window, his head resting on a well-curb, his mat woven of rushes, his quilted robe unlined, covered only by a plain cloth. His limbs were not fully concealed—when the cloth was drawn over his head, his feet were exposed, and when it covered his feet, his head was exposed. Zengzi said, "If you pull the cloth diagonally, it will cover him properly." The wife replied, "A diagonal may be ample, but a straight covering is insufficient. My husband, by refusing to compromise, reached this state. In life, he did not deviate; in death, to deviate would not be his wish." Zengzi asked, "What posthumous name should he be given?" His wife said, "Call him 'Kang.'" Zengzi said, "In life, he could not fill his mouth with food or cover his body with clothing. In death, his limbs are not properly arranged, and there are no offerings of wine or meat. In life, he did not attain righteousness; in death, he did not receive honor. What joy is there in this that he should be called 'Kang'?" His wife replied, "Formerly, the Lord of Lu wished to appoint him to office and make him chief minister, but he declined. This shows he had more than enough honor. The lord bestowed upon him thirty *zhong* of grain, but he refused to accept it. This shows he had more than enough wealth. He savored the blandest flavors in the world, content with the humblest positions. He was not distressed by poverty and lowliness, nor dazzled by wealth and nobility. He sought benevolence and attained it; he sought righteousness and attained it. To call him 'Kang' is most fitting." Zengzi said, "Only such a man could have such a wife!"

The record states: I observe that the transformative power of exemplary conduct was not unique to King Wen. Even in the households of grand ministers, it was evident. Liu Xia Hui’s integrity could not be swayed even by his disciples; Qian Lou’s joy was not fully grasped even by Zengzi. Could these great scholars and learned Confucians truly not match the insight of these common men and women? What they perceived and were moved by ran deep—how wise were these two wives! Those who seek virtue and instruction should take note: even wealth and nobility are not worth prizing.

The wife of Da Fu of Tao, the minister Da Zi. After Da Zi governed Tao for three years, his reputation did not flourish, though his family’s wealth tripled. His wife admonished him, but he paid no heed. Five years later, he returned home with a retinue of a hundred chariots, and his clansmen slaughtered an ox to celebrate. His wife alone held their child and wept. Her mother-in-law grew angry and said, "Why are you so inauspicious?"

The wife replied: "That my husband holds a high office yet performs little duty is to invite harm; that he achieves no merit yet his family prospers is to accumulate misfortune. Recall how Lord Wen of Chu governed the state: his family was poor while the nation grew rich, the ruler respected him and the people revered him, so blessings extended to his descendants and his name endured through later generations. Now my husband pursues wealth and seeks grandeur, heedless of future calamity. I have heard that on South Mountain there is a dark leopard that fasts for seven days in the mist and rain, seeking to moisten its fur and perfect its markings—thus it conceals itself and avoids harm. But the dog that gorges without restraint grows fat only to await its slaughter. Now my husband governs Tao: his family grows rich while the state grows poor, the army holds no respect for him, the people offer no allegiance, and signs of ruin are already manifest. I wish to take our young son and depart." Her mother-in-law grew furious and cast her out. In his later years, Da Zi’s household was indeed executed for banditry, only his aged mother spared. The wife then returned to care for her, and her mother-in-law lived out her natural span.

It is recorded: In observing Da Zi’s wife, can one not see her as a person of the Dao? Only the sage can truly recognize the thief. Those who are not sages, even if burdened with the weight of state and family, still cannot perceive it—how much less can common men and women? The thief need not be plundered by others; one plunders oneself. Today, how many in the world hold high office with little merit and grow wealthy without accomplishment? I fear the people of Qi would still feel shame at such conduct, let alone Da Zi. Thus the noble person must take heed.

The wife of Le Yangzi. Yangzi traveled afar to seek a teacher and returned after a year. His wife knelt and asked the reason. Yangzi said, "I have been away long and miss home; there is no other cause." His wife then took up a knife and approached the loom, saying: "This cloth begins with silkworm cocoons and is completed on the loom. A single thread is piled upon another to make an inch; inches accumulate without cease to form a bolt. Now if this weaving were cut short, the loss of progress would bring shame, and time would be wasted. My husband accumulates learning, daily striving to know what he lacks and to perfect his virtue. If you return halfway, how is this different from severing this cloth?" Yangzi was moved by her words, returned to complete his studies, and did not come home for seven years.

It is recorded: Le Yangzi’s learning does not appear in the classics or histories. If we consider it the learning of sages and worthies, it must reach the depths of sincerity; if we consider it the learning of the common world, it must attain precision and refinement. The ancients toiled unceasingly, their efforts and encouragement like this. Yet today, those who idle away their days and willingly remain ignorant are truly inferior even to common women.

From the *Zuo Tradition*: When Qu Xia of Chu attacked Luo, Guo Boyi saw him off and said, "Mo’ao is certain to fail. He raises his banner high, but his heart is not steadfast." He then went to see the Viscount of Chu and said, "You must reinforce the army." The Viscount declined. Guo Boyi returned and told his wife Deng Man. Deng Man said, "The great officer does not refer to the multitude; he means that the ruler should comfort the common people with trust, instruct the officials with virtue, and restrain Mo’ao with punishment. Mo’ao was arrogant after the battle at Pusao and will act on his own. If he attacks little Luo and you do not pacify him, will he not neglect precautions?" She had meant that the ruler should instruct the troops and favor pacification, summon the officials and encourage them with commands. But Mo’ao did not heed this. How could he not know that the entire Chu army had marched? The Viscount sent men of Lai to pursue him, but they did not catch up. Mo’ao reviled the men of Chu, saying, "Those who remonstrate will be punished." When he reached Hao, the troops crossed in disorder, without formation or preparedness. At Luo, Luo and the Lu Rong routed them, and Mo’ao hanged himself in the wild valley.

King Wu of Chu arrayed his troops in the Jing formation and entrusted command to his generals to attack Sui. As they prepared to set out, he entered and told his wife Deng Man, "My heart is restless." Deng Man sighed and said, "The king’s fortune is at an end. To be full and restless is the Way of Heaven. Our late lord must have known this, for when he faced military affairs, he issued great commands to unsettle the king’s heart. If the army suffers no loss, and the king perishes on the march, it will be the state’s blessing." The king proceeded and died beneath the Gou tree.

It is recorded: In observing Deng Man’s words, one sees she did not let private concerns override public duty, nor affection obscure righteousness, and she knew the altars of the state were weightier than the ruler. In speaking thus, she must have hit the mark. Auspicious and inauspicious omens manifest in one’s bearing; goodness is always foreseen, and evil is always foreknown. Mo’ao’s lifting of his foot and King Wu’s restless heart—disaster was already certain. Why did the Viscount of Chu not perceive it? The attack on Luo and the alliance with Sui only hastened their doom.

How well put were the words of Empress Dowager Guangxian of Song: "If successful, one receives congratulations facing south; if not, the lives of ten thousand miles of people are at stake." Alas!

Should there have been admonitions given before matters unfolded, perhaps the disaster of Deng’s annihilation might have been averted. Yet how could one say Deng Man’s wisdom fell short of this?

When Duke Wen of Jin fled into exile and passed through Cao, Duke Gong of Cao showed him no courtesy. The wife of Xi Fuji said to her husband: "Our lord has been discourteous to the prince of Jin. I observe that his followers are all worthy men—if he takes the throne, the prince will surely return to Jin, gain supremacy among the feudal lords, and punish those who showed him no respect. Cao will be the first to suffer. Why not early distinguish yourself from the rest?" Thereupon, she wove a meal into a gourd and placed a jade disk within it. Duke Wen accepted the meal but returned the jade. Three years later, the Jin army attacked Cao, capturing it in the third month. On the day *bingwu*, they entered the city, reproaching Cao for its failure to employ Xi Fuji while maintaining three hundred chariot officials, and decreed that no one was to enter the precincts of Xi Fuji’s residence. Thus his clan was spared—a repayment of kindness.

It is recorded: Observing the songs of the clam and the mantis, one already knew Cao’s doom. Was this not because they indulged in petty amusements while neglecting far-sighted planning? The woven meal and the hidden jade were precisely such far-sighted planning. The spectacle of conjoined ribs was but a petty amusement. At that time, the way of petty men flourished, their qi and arrogance rampant, while the way of the noble waned, leaving even husband and wife to eat in poverty. Outwardly, their robes and adornments were fine and lovable, yet inwardly, their sense of shame, right and wrong had long since perished. This was the earnest devotion of common folk, unyielding in their attachment. Those who would take this as a mirror should take heed: never let the great affairs of state be reduced to private vengeance, and you will do well.

In the *Book of Han*, when Emperor Gaozu fell ill, Empress Lü asked: "After Your Majesty’s passing, when Chancellor Xiao is gone, whom should we appoint in his place?" The emperor replied: "Cao Shen will do." She asked again, and he said: "Wang Ling is suitable, though somewhat blunt. Chen Ping can assist him. Chen Ping’s wisdom is abundant, yet he cannot bear the burden alone. Zhou Bo is steadfast and unassuming, though lacking in refinement—yet he who will secure the Liu house must be Bo. Let him be made Grand Commandant." The empress pressed further, and the emperor said: "Beyond this, it is not for you to know."

It is recorded: The rise of the Liu house relied entirely on the collective strategies of many, yet its preservation sprang from the emperor’s singular insight. Could the emperor not have foreseen this and made arrangements in advance? Emperor Hui was weak, the forces of Wu and Chu vast, Han Xin and Peng Yue had perished, and the Han house stood alone and vulnerable. Had there been no wise empress, how could order have been restored? This is what is meant by: "To take, one must first give." As for the command of the Northern Army, it was no harder to entrust to kinsmen; the wisdom of Chen Ping and Zhou Bo was most evident in their days as ministers. Could the empress not have made subtle preparations, yielding in every matter? The crisis of the state was unfolding, the royal house newly stabilized, the unraveling of disaster by Bo and Kuai, the growing power of Chan and Lu—without men of paramount merit, other upheavals would surely arise. This, too, is what is meant by: "To take, one must first give." All was the wisdom of emperor and empress.

When King He of Changyi ascended the throne, he indulged in debauchery. Grand General Huo Guang and General of Chariots and Cavalry Zhang Shizhi plotted to depose him. Once their plan was settled, they sent the Minister of Agriculture, Tian Yannian, to inform Chancellor Yang Chang. Yang was startled and fearful, at a loss for words, sweat soaking his back, and could only murmur assent. When Tian left to change his clothes, Yang’s wife hurried from the eastern chamber and said to him: "This is a matter of state. The Grand General’s decision is already made, and he has sent a high minister to inform you, my lord. If you do not swiftly respond and align your heart with his, you will be no better than those who wavered—and will be executed before the deed is done." When Tian returned from changing clothes, Yang’s wife joined the conversation, and they agreed to follow the Grand General’s instructions.

It is recorded: Observing the words of Yang’s wife, one laments the reckless folly of King He of Changyi. What manner of affair is deposition? What office is the chancellorship? The Grand General could send someone to convey his words, and the chancellor’s wife could interject in the discussion. At such a critical juncture for the state, Yang, as chancellor, did not remain in the government but stayed at home. Had there been someone like Song Chang or Zhang Wu at King He’s side, Huo Guang’s plan would have failed; if his plan had failed, Yang and Tian would have met with execution. Thus, Yang’s wife was fortunate to have guessed correctly, while Xiahou Sheng was unfortunate not to have done so. What wisdom was there in this?

Consort Feng was the daughter of Feng Fengshi, the Right General. During the Jianzhao era, the emperor visited the tiger enclosure to watch beasts fight, and the ladies of the rear palace all followed. A bear broke free, climbed the railing, and tried to mount the hall. The consorts and noblewomen all fled in terror, but Feng Jiehao stood directly before the bear. The attendants slew the beast. The emperor asked Jiehao: "Everyone was frightened—why did you alone stand before the bear?" She replied: "I heard that when a fierce beast seizes a person, it stops. I feared it would reach the imperial seat, so I placed myself in its way." The emperor greatly admired her, and his esteem for her grew all the more.

It is recorded: This was an omen of the waning of the Han’s fiery mandate, a sign that the imperial line would soon end. It was no cause for praising the consort, but rather for lamenting the times. The admonition against sitting beneath the eaves, the caution of the son of a thousand gold—even such warnings pale beside the omen of dreaming of bears in the *Shi Gan* poem. Never has there been mention of making sport of fierce beasts for amusement, nor of standing fearless before a bear. A bear may be dreamed of, but it should not be seen. For it to break free without cause distorts the omen. Before long, Consort Zhao emerged, and though she bore children, auspicious signs were repeatedly obstructed. Was this not the clear verification of the bear’s escape?

In the *Book of Later Han*, in the first year of the Jianchu era of Emperor Ming, he wished to enfeoff his maternal uncles. Due to a great drought, critics attributed it to the lack of benevolence in such a move.

The officials again memorialized that the old precedents should be followed, but the Empress Dowager refused, issuing an edict that read: "Those who speak on this matter all seek to curry favor and secure blessings for themselves. In the past, the five marquises of the Wang clan were enfeoffed together, and at that time, yellow mist blanketed the land—yet no timely rain fell in response. Moreover, the disasters of Tian Fen and Dou Ying—whose favor and arrogance led to their downfall—have been passed down through the ages. Thus, the late Emperor guarded against the maternal uncles, forbidding them from holding positions of power. How could I betray the late Emperor’s intent, dishonor the virtue of my ancestors, and repeat the ruinous missteps of the Western Han?" She firmly refused.

The Emperor read the edict and sighed, saying: "Since the founding of the Han, the enfeoffment of maternal uncles has been as natural as the investiture of the Emperor’s sons as kings. Though the Empress Dowager is truly modest, how can I alone withhold grace from my three uncles?" He replied: "I have pondered this repeatedly. If grace is bestowed, both sides benefit—how could I merely seek the reputation of humility while leaving the Emperor open to the charge of failing in familial duty? I have often observed that in wealthy and noble families, when ranks and emoluments accumulate excessively, it is like a tree bearing fruit twice over—its roots will surely be harmed. The highest act of filial piety is to bring peace to one’s parents. Now, with repeated portents and grain prices soaring, I lie awake day and night, unable to rest. How could I prioritize the enfeoffment of my uncles and defy my mother’s earnest wishes? I am by nature stern and quick-tempered, with a fiery qi in my breast—do not oppose me." The Emperor then desisted.

Lu observed: The steadfast humility of Emperor Ming’s virtue was rooted in his profound reflection on past events. Those luminous pearls and verdant seedlings were but the burdens of empty reputation—could the late Emperor truly have been unenlightened? Chastened by the folly of concealing true intent for the sake of repute, he could not dismiss even ambiguous omens. The enfeoffment of princes and the ranks of kings were but tangible proofs—could he truly have been unmindful at the time? Warned by the yellow mists that shrouded the four quarters, he could not treat such matters with indifference. Later, Emperor Ming adhered to this principle, and thus in the portraits of the Cloud Terrace, he omitted even the relatives of the Empress’s chamber. Between husband and wife, mother and child, there was unity without discord.

Empress Deng of Hexi was five years old when her grandmother, the Elder Lady, doted on her and personally trimmed her hair. The old woman’s eyes dim with age, she accidentally cut the girl’s forehead, drawing blood, yet the child made no sound. When those around her marveled, she said: “It is not that I feel no pain, but I could not bear to distress an elder’s heart, so I endured it.” At twelve, she had mastered the *Analects* and other classics, her aspirations fixed upon the canonical texts, never inquiring after household affairs. Her family called her “the scholar.”

When she grew older and was selected for the palace, her beauty and grace set her apart from all others. Once, when she fell ill, the Emperor ordered her mother and brothers to enter and personally attend to her care. The Empress demurred, saying the palace’s prohibitions were too weighty for her kin to bear. The Emperor replied: “Others count repeated entry as an honor—do you alone regard it as a burden?” At that time, the vassal states vied to present rare and exotic treasures as tribute. Once she was established in the central palace, she ordered all such offerings forbidden.

Whenever the Emperor sought to bestow offices and ranks upon the Deng clan, the Empress would plead in sorrow, and thus her brother Deng Xun remained a mere Gentleman of the Tiger Guards throughout the Emperor’s reign. When she later became Grand Empress Dowager, a favored attendant named Jicheng was falsely accused of sorcery and witchcraft. The case was sent to the palace prison for interrogation. Recalling the late Emperor’s kindness toward the man, she summoned him and questioned him closely. It was revealed that the deed had been committed by an imperial servant. All marveled at her sagacity, deeming her truly enlightened.

She often held that spirits were inscrutable and that excessive sacrifices brought no blessing, and so she abolished all the offices of the various cults. She also sought out the younger brothers of Emperor He, along with over forty male descendants of the Princes of Jibei and Hejian, as well as more than thirty young men of the Deng clan’s close kin. She established residences for them, instructing them in the classics, personally overseeing their studies and admonitions, following the precedent of the Yongping era. As the late Duke had recorded his martial achievements on bamboo and silk, she complemented this with the civil virtue of educating descendants, ensuring they were well-disciplined and never transgressed the laws and statutes.

Lu observed: Some say that Empress Deng, in assuming regency, issued decrees throughout her life, to the point that the young Emperor cast sidelong glances and clenched his fists, while upright officials harbored resentment and met their deaths. Yet when Ban Zhao admonished her, she dismissed her entire household from office. When a beloved nephew committed a minor transgression, she shaved his head and beard in apology. This, too, may be called enlightened.

After the Jian’guang era, when power reverted to Wang Mang, worthy men were humiliated and executed, while flatterers and partisans advanced. Thus it is known that wielding authority invites slander, and what one cherishes may not be one’s own. Only by straining one’s heart to relieve the realm’s woes can a ruler strengthen the state. The noble person must not, for the sake of a single flaw, sever all ties with the mother of the world. Thus I record this.

From *Records of the Three Kingdoms*: The Breaker of Bandits General was of the Wu clan, wife to Sun Jian. In Jian’s youth, her kinsmen sought to refuse his suit. The lady said, “Why cling to a single daughter and court disaster?” Thus she consented to the marriage, bearing sons—Ce and Quan.

Once, Ce, on account of a grievance with the Merit Officer Wei Teng, was about to kill him. The lady leaned over the great well and said, “You have newly established yourself south of the Yangzi and ought to honor the worthy and overlook faults to record merits. This Merit Officer Wei serves the public good, offering you counsel in full. If you kill him today, tomorrow all will turn against you. I cannot bear to see calamity befall you and shall first cast myself into this well.” Ce was greatly alarmed and immediately released Teng.

When Quan, in his youth, assumed leadership, the lady aided in governing the state and military, bringing great benefit. Cao Cao sent a letter demanding Quan send a hostage. Quan was about to comply when Zhou Yu called upon the lady, saying, “Now Wu inherits the legacy of father and elder brother, commanding the multitudes of six commanderies. Our troops are well-trained, provisions abundant, and officers and soldiers obey orders. We smelt mountains and boil seas, enriching all within our borders—what compulsion is there to send a hostage?” The lady replied, “Lord Yu’s counsel is sound,” and thus did not dare proceed.

She was honored as Grand Empress and, before her passing, summoned Zhang Zhao and others to entrust them with affairs of state.

From this region emerged fierce and resolute figures, bearing the bold spirit of Sun Ce. His wife, Lady Xu, was wise and perceptive, skilled in divination. When Sun Quan executed Wu Commandery’s Grand Administrator Sheng Xian, Xian’s former subordinate Yan Lan sought vengeance, and Xu Xu’s attendants also plotted rebellion. As the various county magistrates and prefects gathered for a meeting, Xu Xu intended to follow the road to Sheng Dao, and consulted Lady Xu for divination. She warned that the omens were inauspicious and advised waiting for another day, but Xu Xu ignored her and held a grand banquet for his guests. Drunk, he was killed by the conspirators among his attendants. Yan Lan entered the residence, seized all the concubines, and attempted to force himself upon Lady Xu. Fearing harm if she resisted, she deceived him, saying, “Wait until the end of the mourning period, when I will perform the rites and remove my mourning garments.” Lan agreed. Secretly, she sent a trusted servant to summon former generals Sun Gao and Fu Ying, and covertly assembled over twenty attendants to lie in wait and plot. When the day came, after the rites were completed and mourning clothes removed, she perfumed her garments and set up a separate curtained chamber to await Lan. She then sent for him, and he, suspecting nothing, entered with a lavish feast. As Lady Xu went out to greet him and had just begun to bow, she called out, and Gao and Ying emerged, seizing and killing Lan. Lady Xu then donned her mourning attire again, presented Lan’s head at Xu Xu’s grave, and the entire army was stunned, regarding the event as divine.

It is recorded: Sun Ce’s impulse to kill Wei Teng mirrors Sun Quan’s grudge against Sheng Xian. Lady Xu’s divination to stop her husband parallels the remonstrances against the young lord of Wu. Ce was fortunate to heed the warning before disaster struck, while Xu Xu, tragically, ignored it on the brink of ruin. Had the mother’s wisdom and strategy been heeded, her honor would have endured to the end; instead, the wife’s foresight was in vain, and all was lost in sorrow. Yet as a woman, she displayed resourcefulness and cunning, unyielding resolve—not only avenging her husband but also preserving her own chastity. This aligns with the *Yijing*’s words: “Grieving for her virtue, steadfast, a woman’s warning: the husband meets misfortune.” Lady Xu’s divination surely reflected this understanding.

The *Book of Jin* records: Hua Dan’s wife, Lady Xin, styled Xianying, was the daughter of Wei’s Palace Attendant Xin Pi. She was intelligent and discerning. When Emperor Wen of Wei was at odds with Chen Si Wang and later named heir apparent, he embraced Xin Pi and said, “Lady Xin, do you know my joy?” Pi relayed this to Xianying, who replied, “The heir apparent succeeds the ruler to oversee the ancestral temples and altars of state. Ritual dictates sorrow, yet he rejoices—how can this last?” Later, her younger brother Xin Chang served as an aide to the Grand General Cao Shuang. When Sima Yi was about to execute Shuang, he closed the city gates while the emperor was outside. Chang, alarmed, asked Xianying, “The Son of Heaven is beyond the walls, and the Grand Tutor has sealed the gates. Rumors say this bodes ill for the state.” She replied, “As I see it, the Grand Tutor would not act thus—this is merely to execute Shuang. Yet you must not remain inside.” He asked, “How can I abandon my post?” She said, “Upholding duty is a person’s great principle. Even in peril, one may still show compassion. Follow the crowd.” Chang went out, and Sima Yi indeed executed Shuang. After the affair settled, Chang sighed, “Had I not consulted my sister, I would have nearly failed in righteousness.”

Later, when Zhong Hui was appointed General Who Pacifies the West, Xianying asked her nephew Xin You, “Why is Zhong Shiji heading west?” You replied, “To conquer Shu.” She said, “Hui indulges his impulses in office—this is no way to endure in a subordinate’s position. I fear he harbors other ambitions.” When Hui prepared to depart, he requested You as his aide. Xianying grew anxious, saying, “Disaster will come to our family.” You repeatedly petitioned Emperor Wen, who refused. Xianying told You, “Go then. Remember: the noble person of old devoted filial piety at home and upheld loyalty abroad. In office, think of your duties; in righteousness, think of your principles. Do not bring your parents sorrow. Amidst the trials of war, only benevolence can prevail.” Hui reached Shu and indeed rebelled. You ultimately returned unharmed, such was her foresight.

It is recorded: Observing Lady Xin’s wisdom, she did not merely predict events accurately. Her words on Wei’s succession touched upon the great balance of gain and loss; her counsel on Cao Shuang’s execution concerned the critical moment of dynastic transition; her warning about Zhong Hui’s rebellion addressed the paramount duty of governance. In matters of ruler and minister, inner and outer, kin and stranger, she discerned truth as if by candlelight, weighing right and wrong as with a scale. Even the so-called great men and gentlemen of her time fell short. Alas! Should such paragons be sought only among the women of the inner chambers?

Lady Zhong, wife of Wang Hun, styled Yan, was the great-granddaughter of Zhong Yao, Grand Mentor of Wei, and the daughter of Zhong Hui, Gentleman of the Yellow Gate. From childhood, Yan could compose essays, and as she grew, she became wise, magnanimous, and refined. Well-versed in the classics and histories, she possessed a graceful bearing, excelled in whistling and connoisseurship, and her conduct in ritual and propriety served as a model for her kin. After marrying Hun, she bore Wang Ji.

Once, as husband and wife sat together, Ji passed through the courtyard. Hun joyfully remarked, “To have a son like this is enough to console a man’s heart.” Hun’s younger brother Lun had a daughter who was also talented and virtuous, and they sought a worthy husband for her. At the time, there was a remarkably handsome son of a military family, and Ji wished to arrange a marriage for him. He informed Yan, who replied, “First, let me see him.” Ji had the young man mingle with a group of servants, and Yan observed him from behind a curtain. She then said to Ji, “The one in coarse clothing—was he not the one you selected?” Ji replied, “Yes.” Yan said, “This man’s talent is indeed outstanding, but his lineage is humble and his lifespan short; he will not live to fulfill his potential. The marriage should not proceed.” They abandoned the idea, and the man indeed died a few years later. Yan’s keen judgment and foresight were all of this kind.

It is recorded: With Hun’s profound insight came Yan, and with Yan’s discernment came Ji. Within one family, fathers were true fathers, sons true sons, husbands true husbands, and wives true wives—truly a flourishing household. Was it not fitting that the Wang clan should rise to prominence? Hun’s younger brother’s wife, Lady Hao, was also virtuous. Though Yan hailed from a noble family, she treated Hao with warmth and respect, and Hao did not humble herself in deference, nor did Yan lord her status over her. Contemporaries praised Lady Zhong’s propriety and Lady Hao’s exemplary conduct.

Du Youdao’s wife, Lady Yan, styled Xian, was chaste and virtuous, possessing both wisdom and magnanimity. Her husband died young, leaving behind a young son, Zhi, and a daughter, Han. Though still young herself, Yan vowed never to remarry. She raised her children with care, instructing them in ritual and propriety. Zhi later gained renown, and Han, too, was known for her virtue. Fu Xuan sought her as his second wife, and Yan consented. At the time, Xuan was at odds with He Yan and Deng Yang, who constantly sought to harm him, so no one dared arrange a marriage with him. When Yan agreed to the match, those within and without expressed concern, saying, “He and Deng hold power and will surely bring ruin to Xuan—like toppling a mountain onto an egg or pouring boiling water on snow.” Yan replied, “You see only one side of the matter, not the other. He and Deng are arrogant and extravagant; they will surely bring about their own downfall. I fear the egg will shatter and the snow melt—what is to come will come.” Later, they were indeed executed by Emperor Xuan. Zhi rose to the position of Governor of Nan’an. His cousin Yu, serving as Inspector of Qinzhou, was falsely accused and summoned back. Yan sent him a letter admonishing him to endure humiliation and bear disgrace, for he was destined for the rank of the Three Excellencies. Yu indeed became a Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary.

Xuan’s son by his first wife, Cheng, was six years old when he accompanied his stepmother to visit Yan. Yan said to him, “You are a thousand-mile colt—you will surely go far.” She arranged for him to marry her niece, and he, too, later gained fame throughout the land. Such was her ability to recognize talent.

The *Record* states: Observing the mother of the Yan clan, her virtue, wisdom, and insight were far beyond the ordinary. In foreseeing the downfall of He and Deng, she did not merely rely on conventional sayings like “Deng’s sinews fail to bind his bones—this is the restlessness of a ghost” or “He’s blood lacks luster—this is the gloom of a ghost.” Yet in recognizing the talents of Chang Yu, was she not akin to the scholars of Yingchuan, such as Yu Chun, who marveled at Xian Xian’s writings as nearly poetic? One judgment was made by principle, the other by observing conduct. How, then, did she attain such discernment? Precisely because she preserved within herself the trials of adversity, and thus Heaven refined her into a paragon. This is not only true for orphaned ministers and disgraced sons, but also for widows and chaste wives.

Liu Yin’s wife, née Zhang, was such a woman. Yin was deeply versed in the classics and history, endowed with lofty aspirations for service, frugal yet not austere, pure yet not aloof—all in his village and clan praised him. When the Prince of Qi, serving as Minister of Works, summoned him as an aide, and General Yang Hu of the Southern Campaign invited him to join his staff, he declined both on grounds of illness. At the time, a fellow townsman, Zhang Xuanzi, a man of keen perception, urged Yin to accept the appointments. Yin replied: “The two lords of our age are the pillars of Jin. I aspire to greatness, yet I am but a rough-hewn beam. Without their support, how could I stand?” Moreover, with his grandmother still living, if he accepted another’s command, he could not fulfill his filial duty to serve her—this was why Ziyu declined the Qi minister’s offer. Xuanzi said: “What you say is beyond the understanding of ordinary men.” He then gave his daughter to Yin in marriage.

Xuanzi was a powerful clan leader in Bingzhou, wealthy in resources. His wife protested: “Our daughter is only fourteen, with such beauty and intelligence—why fear she could not become the consort of a duke or marquis? Why marry her to Yin so hastily?” Xuanzi replied: “This is not for you to comprehend.” He instructed his daughter: “Yin is profoundly filial, his devotion moves even the unseen; his talents and insight surpass the age. This man will surely rise far, becoming a renowned statesman. You must serve him with care.” Zhang, gentle and obedient by nature, was known for her filial devotion to her mother-in-law and treated Yin with the reverence due a lord or father.

She bore seven sons, five of whom each mastered one classic, one the *Records of the Grand Historian*, and one the *Book of Han*. Within a single household, ten scholarly pursuits flourished. In the northern provinces, the Liu family’s learning was unrivaled.

The *Record* states: In ancient times, filial piety brought men to office, and thus tales of miraculous grain and mulberry transformations appear in their biographies—here, we omit such accounts, for mere records cannot do justice to their virtue. Yet Xuanzi’s discernment was such that he settled his daughter’s marriage based on a single conversation. This is the beauty of judging words and observing deeds—a model for those who cherish their daughters. As for the five sons each mastering a classic, one the *Records of the Grand Historian*, and one the *Book of Han*, with seven scholarly pursuits thriving in one household—this is especially worthy of emulation.

From the *History of the Song*: Empress Liu of Emperor Zhenzong, known posthumously as Zhangxian Mingsu, was quick-witted and well-versed in history. When she heard matters of court, she could recount their origins and conclusions. Zhenzong often reviewed memorials from across the realm late into the night, and she was privy to all palace affairs. When questioned, she would cite precedents in response, earning the emperor’s deep respect. In the fourth year of Tianxi, the emperor fell gravely ill and remained in the palace, with many affairs entrusted to the empress. After Zhenzong’s death, she became Grand Empress Dowager. Matters of state and military importance were decided by her authority. For eleven years, the emperor and the empress dowager jointly presided over the Chengming Hall. Though governance emanated from the palace, her decrees were strict and clear, her grace and authority extended throughout the realm. Those close to her were granted little leniency, and she never made arbitrary changes. Rewards within and beyond the court were measured. Formerly, tea bestowed upon great ministers bore dragon and phoenix motifs. The empress dowager said: “How could such designs befit subjects?” She ordered the ministry to create new designs for imperial gifts.

The empress dowager would replace the imperial tableware with plain vessels whenever her clan members dined, saying: “These are court utensils—do not let them enter my household.”

The *Record* states: The precedent of an empress dowager of the Song assuming regency began here—why is this worth noting? The *Book of Changes*, in the hexagram *The Family*, says: “Wealth within the family brings great fortune, for the proper order is maintained.” At that time, the emperor was gravely ill, and the heir apparent was still young. Had the empress dowager not possessed such wisdom, who else could have governed the realm? The emperor’s deep trust in her was well-founded.

When she first took the throne, there was no precedent to follow. Had she repeated the mistakes of the Han and Tang, how could the Song have maintained its rule? Her conduct was beyond reproach. She upheld authority without overstepping her subordinate role, and followed the Dao of Heaven without defying the times.

When Fang Zhonggong requested the establishment of a temple for the Liu clan, she refused. When Cheng Lin presented a portrait of Empress Wu of Tang holding court, she rejected it. Other measures—such as reclaiming surplus grain from transport officials, replacing imperial utensils, heeding the counsel of chief ministers, and bestowing honors upon the deceased—were all matters of state that could not be disregarded.

Empress Cao of Renzong was wise and well-versed in classics and history, skilled in *feibai* calligraphy. In the intercalary first month of the eighth year of Qingli, when the emperor ordered lanterns to be displayed again for the full-moon festival, she admonished him to cease.

Three days later, several palace guards mutinied. They leapt over the rooftops and stormed the imperial bedchamber. The empress, who had been attending the emperor, rose at once upon hearing the disturbance. The emperor attempted to flee, but she barred the door, shielding him, and urgently summoned the palace guard commander Wang Shouzhong to lead troops inside. Anticipating the rebels would set fires, she secretly ordered water to be prepared. As expected, the rebels lit torches to burn the curtains, but the flames were extinguished at once.

That night, she personally cut locks of hair from the attending officials and maids, declaring: “Tomorrow, rewards will be given—this will serve as proof.” Thus, they fought with all their might, and the rebels were swiftly captured and executed.

When palace concubines conspired with the guards, they deserved execution. Some pleaded for mercy through favored consorts, and the emperor spared their lives. The empress insisted they be punished according to the law, saying: “Without this, how can the palace be kept pure?”

When the future Emperor Yingzong was only four, she examined his character thoroughly. Later, when he was named heir, her counsel played a significant role. When the emperor suddenly passed away at night, she gathered all the palace gate keys before her and summoned the crown prince. By dawn, the chief ministers, including Han Qi, arrived and escorted Yingzong to the throne.

When the emperor fell ill, she requested to temporarily manage state and military affairs. She held court at the small eastern hall of the inner palace. When ministers presented matters of doubt, she would say: “Discuss it further among yourselves,” never imposing her own opinion. Though dozens of memorials arrived daily, she could recall every detail with precision. She granted no leniency to the Cao clan or her attendants, and the palace remained orderly.

The *Record* states: When Empress Mingsu held court, she intended to wield power. Thus, within the palace, there were rebellions by Zhou Huaizheng, Yang Chongxun, and Yang Huaigao; outside, plots by Ding Qing, Qian Weiyan, and Cao Liyong. Had Wang Zeng not stood firm, her reign might not have ended well.

When Empress Guangxian held court, she had no desire to seize authority. When ministers presented uncertain matters, she would say: “Discuss it further among yourselves,” never imposing her own will. Though she lacked Han Qi’s bold admonitions, she never clung to power. This became a model for later generations.

Empress Gao of Yingzong was benevolent, wise, and discerning. When Emperor Shenzong repeatedly sought to build a grand residence for the Gao clan, she refused. Eventually, she accepted only a plot of unused land outside Wangchun Gate, and all construction costs were borne by the empress dowager, without drawing a single coin from the state treasury.

When the emperor fell ill, the chief ministers, including Wang Gui, came to inquire. The empress wept and, caressing the young Zhezong, said: “He is filial. Since the emperor took medicine, he has never left his side. He delights in studying the *Book of Documents* and reciting the *Analects*.” She then presented him to the ministers, and that very day, he was named crown prince.

When Cai Que was demoted, the empress told the ministers: “At the end of the Yuanyou era, I showed the present emperor’s writings to Wang Gui. He submitted a memorial of congratulations, and the succession was settled. Since the son succeeds the father, what objection could there be? Yet Cai Que, claiming credit for securing the succession, recklessly stirred up trouble, seeking to sow confusion in the future. I banished him. This concerns the great plan of the imperial house—how could I heed the slander of treacherous men?”

When her paternal uncle Zun Yu was punished for military failure, Cai Que flattered her by requesting his reinstatement. She replied: “During the Lingwu campaign, Zun Yu brought suffering to millions. The late emperor received the news and was so shocked he could not sleep all night, leading to his sudden illness. The disaster was Zun Yu’s doing. That he escaped execution is already fortunate. How dare I favor private ties over righteousness?”

After Song Yongchen was dismissed, a wet nurse entered to plead for his return. The empress, seeing her approach, asked: “Why have you come? Are you here to lobby for Yongchen and others? Do you still seek imperial decrees to interfere in state affairs, as before? If you persist, I will have you executed.” From then on, such decrees ceased.

When she fell ill, Lü Dafang, Fan Chunren, and others came to inquire. She said: “Tell me—over the past nine years, have I ever shown favoritism to the Gao clan? I have been utterly impartial. Even when my own son and daughter were dying, I did not see them.” With tears in her eyes, she continued: “The late emperor often regretted past events, weeping over them. The emperor should remember this well.”

She added: “I wished to speak plainly to the emperor. After my death, many will try to manipulate him—he must not listen. You ministers should also retire early, so the emperor may employ a new generation.” Then she called her attendants and asked: “Have the communal festival meals been distributed?” She instructed the ministers: “Each of you, take a spoonful. Next year, when you eat the festival meal, remember me.”

The Record states: Observing the dying admonitions of Empress Dowager Xuanren of the Song, one cannot but weep upon repeated reflection. Comparing her with Empress Dowager Feng of the Northern Wei—both having ruled as grandmothers—Xuanren embodied ten virtues, while Feng committed ten transgressions.

What are the ten virtues? First, her benevolence and clarity; second, her compassion and resoluteness; □ third, her trust in the worthy; fourth, her reverence for the old; fifth, her abolition of harsh governance; sixth, her repeal of the New Laws; seventh, her pacification of the realm; eighth, her suppression of border conflicts; ninth, her refusal of court congratulations in the main hall; and tenth, her rejection of private favors for her maternal clan. Which of these is not worthy of contemplation?

What are the ten transgressions? First, her usurpation of power; second, her assumption of imperial prerogatives; third, her misconduct; fourth, her private indulgence of favorites; fifth, her murder of the sovereign; sixth, her arbitrary executions; seventh, her jealousy of the sovereign’s brilliance; eighth, her confinement of the sovereign without food in bitter cold; ninth, her heeding of eunuchs’ words; and tenth, her flogging of the sovereign dozens of times. Which of these is not deserving of hatred?

Yet no sooner had the communal festival meal cooled than her policies were fiercely overturned. In one case, the golden tablets and funeral armlets were presented, and mourning never ceased.

Thus it was that Wei employed the Xia to transform the Yi, thereby suppressing their urgent and anxious longings; whereas Song, on the verge of being transformed by the Yi, suffered no less than the turmoil of confusion. Though this arose from human failings, it was also the decree of Heaven’s course. Had it not been so, though grandfather and grandson were of one body, the latter’s earnest admonitions would have been met with the sovereign’s indifference—what the wise would call folly, and what in governance is deemed a grievous error.

*The Record of Song’s Illustrious Ministers* states: Fu Bi, Duke of Zheng, married Lady Han of the State of Han, who was the daughter of Yuanxian. When Bi first entered the examination halls, Mu Xiu said to him, “The civil service examinations are not enough to fully display your talents; you ought to make your name in the higher examinations.” It so happened that an edict was issued to select scholars through the higher examinations. At the time, Bi’s father was serving as an official in Yaozhou and was about to return west. Fan Wenzheng sent someone to pursue him, urging him to hasten back to the capital. Upon meeting Wenzheng, Bi declined, saying he had never studied for such examinations. Wenzheng replied, “I have already heard of your recommendation from the ministers. For some time now, I have prepared a chamber for you, filled with texts for the higher examinations—you may go and reside there.”

At the time, Yuanxian was serving as chancellor and sought to arrange a marriage with Wenzheng. Wenzheng said, “If your daughter is to marry an ordinary official, I dare not presume to know. But if you seek a scholar of national distinction, none surpasses Fu Bi.” Yuanxian, upon meeting Bi, held him in great esteem and immediately proposed the match. Bi thus passed the examination for *Xianliang Fangzheng* with distinction.

Earlier, Bi’s father had been a retainer in the household of Lord Wenmu of Lü. One day, he said to Wenmu, “My son is about ten years old; I wish to send him to the academy to study under the tutelage of Attending Secretary Tai Zhu.” Wenmu agreed. When he met the boy, he was astonished and declared, “This young man will one day hold a position like mine, but his achievements will far surpass my own.” He ordered that Bi be educated alongside his own sons and provided him with generous support. Later, Bi indeed rose to the rank of chancellor. It was said that the three lords—Wenzheng, Wenmu, and Yuanxian—were unmatched in their ability to recognize talent, and Lady Han was no less discerning.

The *Record* observes: Though the dust of worldly appearances may be difficult to transcend, the discernment of dragons and qilin among steeds must naturally exist. In this, the three lords each acted without partiality: one did not favor his son because of a retainer’s lowly status; another did not withhold his daughter due to his own high rank as chancellor; and the third did not shrink from advancing his disciple despite the risk of suspicion. In the end, phoenixes shone together, ice and jade gleamed in mutual brilliance, pillars stood in equal splendor, and both family and state alike reaped the benefits. Such deeds are truly rare and worthy of record.

*The Hongdao Record*, Scroll Forty-Three Concluded
*The Hongdao Record*, Scroll Forty-Four: Wisdom

**Wisdom Among Brothers**

From *Mencius*:
Wan Zhang asked, "Was Shun in the right?"
Mencius replied, "How could he not have been?"
"Yet Shun did not know that Xiang was about to kill him."
"How could he not have known? When Xiang grieved, he grieved; when Xiang rejoiced, he rejoiced."

Chen Jia asked, "When the Duke of Zhou appointed Guan Shu to oversee Yin, Guan Shu rebelled with Yin. Did this happen?"
Mencius said, "Yes."
"Did the Duke of Zhou know he would rebel yet still appoint him?"
"He did not know."
"Then even sages may err?"
"The Duke of Zhou was the younger brother; Guan Shu, the elder. Was the Duke of Zhou’s error not fitting?"

The *Record* observes:
Expediency (*quan*) is the great application of the sage; wisdom (*zhi*) is the foundation of practicing expediency. Expediency is not something the great sage fails to employ, nor is wisdom something he fails to follow—each is required to its utmost.

In Xiang’s time, Shun was not incapable of exercising expediency. Yet with nine sons, two daughters, a hundred officials, oxen, and sheep, his heart was like that of a destitute man with nowhere to turn. Thus, when Xiang grieved, he grieved; when Xiang rejoiced, he rejoiced. This was not due to any lack of true wisdom but to his desire to accord with his kin.

In the time of Guan and Cai, the Duke of Zhou was not incapable of employing wisdom. Yet with the royal house newly stabilized and stubborn people still numerous, how could his heart bear to slight his kin? Thus, he first appointed Guan Shu to oversee Yin and later punished his rebellion. This was not due to any lack of true benevolence but to his desire to secure the royal house.

If later generations fail to bestow rewards as at Taiyuan—withholding what should be given, provoking the shame and resentment of foolish sons, or believing hollow words of deference; or hesitating when decisions must be made, leading to great bloodshed—then both benevolence and wisdom are lost.

The *Yi Jing*'s *Ming Yi* hexagram states: "It is advantageous to abide in hardship and correctness," for one must obscure one’s brightness. When inner turmoil arises yet one maintains rectitude of purpose, as did Jizi.

The *Record* says: The *Book of Documents* states, "I shall emerge and dwell elsewhere; my aged house has yielded to desolation." This is what is meant by outwardly obscuring one’s brightness. "To pacify oneself as a common man and offer oneself to a master" is what is meant by inwardly preserving one’s rectitude. Such were the ancient sages—luminous yet wise, preserving themselves. Those whose intelligence dazzles others while their inner substance is lacking cannot be spoken of in the same breath.

The *Zuozhuan* records: Duke Hui of Lu’s primary consort was Mencius. After Mencius died, he took Shengzi as his secondary wife, who bore Duke Yin. Duke Wu of Song had a daughter, Zhongzi, whose palm bore a mark at birth reading, "To be the Lady of Lu." Thus, Zhongzi was wed to Lu and bore Duke Huan. When Duke Hui died, Duke Yin ascended the throne to serve as regent.

The *Record* says: Observing the affairs of Duke Yin and Duke Huan is like watching an infant at play—tossed into a nest, given three times, taken three times. It is a jest for all ages. The failure to clarify great righteousness and the lack of secrecy in critical matters are equally unworthy of concealment. When Duke Hui’s primary consort died, both Sheng and Zhong were but concubines, and the mark on the palm should have been disregarded. When Duke Hui died without a testament, both Yin and Huan were merely sons of concubines, and the name of filial devotion should have been set aside for this principle. Had this been done, the scheming of petty men would have been averted. One ought to have forthrightly clarified great righteousness, rectified past errors, ensured names were correct and words proper, and cut off the source of trouble at its root. Then Yu Fu’s wickedness would not have dared to run rampant, and Huan might have found contentment in his station. This was the critical moment—both opportunities were lost, yet Duke Yin remained blithely unaware of impending disaster. I cannot fathom his state of mind. Confucius said, "One without foresight will surely face immediate woe." Hu’s commentary also states: "If one does not resolve matters early, how can good prevail?"

When Lord Huan of Cai died, the people of Cai summoned Cai Ji from Chen. Ji was the courtesy name of the younger brother of the Marquis of Cai. In autumn, Cai Ji returned from Chen to Cai, and the people of Cai praised him.

According to He [Xiu]’s commentary: The Lord of Cai had no son; Ji was next in line to succeed, but the Lord wished to enthrone Xianwu and despised Ji, so Ji fled to Chen. When the Lord died, Ji returned to attend the funeral, harboring no resentment, and was praised for his virtue, hence his courtesy name.

The *Record* says: Duke Yin was one who could have halted but did not, could have hastened but did not. Duke Mu was one who gave as though not giving, seized as though not seizing. Cai Ji was one who could depart when he should, remain when he should, take when he should, and relinquish when he should. In this, none were not deemed wise and virtuous.

In the autumn of the eleventh year of Duke Zhuang, Song suffered a great flood. The Duke sent an envoy to offer condolences, saying, "Heaven has sent excessive rains, harming the sacrificial grains. How could one not offer condolences?" The reply came: "It is I alone who was irreverent; Heaven has sent this disaster. Yet you deem it a concern for your lord, and I bow to the honor of your command." Zang Wenzhong said, "Song shall rise again! When Yu and Tang blamed themselves, their rise was swift. When Jie and Zhou blamed others, their fall was sudden. Moreover, when states suffer calamity, it is proper to express sympathy. To speak with trepidation and name it propriety—this bodes well." Later, it was heard that this referred to the rebellion of Prince Yushuo. Zang Sunda said, "He is fit to be ruler, for he has a heart that pities the people."

The *Record* says: Zang Wenzhong believed Song would rise because it blamed itself. Was this so? The omen of the great flood was the portent of regicide. Better to reflect inwardly and trace the true cause of disaster than to blame oneself and gain an empty reputation. To be unrestrained yet without propriety is the root of chaos; to conceal evil and shun criticism is the harbinger of calamity. Min’s self-debasement and self-aggrandizement brought Heaven’s punishment, like a shadow following form, like an echo answering sound—this was no true concern for the people.

The Viscount of Chu attacked the Rong of Luhun and proceeded to Luo, displaying his military might at the borders of Zhou. King Ding sent Wangsun Man to offer labor to the Viscount of Chu, who inquired about the size and weight of the Nine Tripods. Wangsun Man replied: "It lies in virtue, not in the tripods. In ancient times, when the Xia possessed virtue, distant lands depicted their creatures and offered metal from the Nine Provinces to cast the tripods, engraving images of all things to prepare the people. Thus, when they entered rivers and marshes, mountains and forests, no demons or sprites could harm them, enabling harmony between high and low and the reception of Heaven’s favor. When Jie’s virtue was benighted, the tripods were transferred to Shang, which endured for six hundred years. When Shang Zhou was cruel and tyrannical, the tripods were transferred to Zhou. When virtue is radiant and bright, even if small, it is weighty. When it is treacherous and benighted, even if great, it is light. Heaven blesses bright virtue, which has its limits. When King Cheng established the tripods at Jiao Ru, he divined thirty generations and seven hundred years—this was Heaven’s mandate. Though Zhou’s virtue has declined, Heaven’s mandate has not changed. The weight of the tripods cannot yet be questioned."

The *Record* says: I observe that Wangsun Man’s wisdom was sufficient for action, yet he did not act—he lacked self-strengthening. Mencius said, "When a state is at leisure, if one clarifies its governance and punishments at such a time, even great states will surely stand in awe." The *Book of Songs* says, "Before Heaven’s rain darkens, strip the mulberry’s bark, mend the windows and doors. Now, among these people below, who would dare insult me?" Chu is lawless, usurping the rites of the Central States, its heart that of a serpent or pig, its might that of a tiger or wolf—how could this be unknown? If Zhou’s lord and ministers truly valued virtue, honored scholars, placed the worthy in office, and entrusted the capable with duties, Chu would be too busy submitting to take heed. Why then did Zhaizi falsify commands, Mao Su disrupt the state, commit usurpation, murder, and treachery, bringing such great shame?

Though they might gain praise from external voices, they lacked the resolve to rouse themselves with plans of self-strengthening, and thus it came to pass that Prince Chao fled to Chu and the Nine Tripods failed to serve their purpose—this much was already evident.

Wu Shang and his younger brother Wu Yuan were the sons of She. When King Ping of Chu seized She at Fei, Wu Qi said: "She’s sons are talented; if they remain alive, they will surely bring trouble to Chu. Why not summon them under the pretense of sparing their father’s life? They will surely come." The king sent for them. Shang said to Yuan: "Go to our father. I will return to die. My wisdom does not match yours. You have heard the command to spare our father—how can you not hasten to him? Our kin have been slaughtered—how can you not avenge them? Fleeing to save our father is filial. Weighing your actions by their merit is benevolent. Choosing your duty and going forth is wisdom. Strive for this." When She heard that Yuan was not coming, he said: "The lords and ministers of Chu will surely eat late into the night."

The *Lu Record* says: "Yuan’s perverse actions and inverted schemes were not without resentment. As for Wu Qi, I know not what blame he deserves. The stain of the *New Terrace*, the defilement of the green fly, the grievance of *Xiao Bian*, the sorrow of *Zhen Cui*—his accumulated evil had reached its limit. Why then did he urge Yuan to avenge him, seeking to sever the root of disaster only to nourish it further? There was no end to the ruin. Knowing Wu’s existence, he fanned its rise; knowing the calamity to come, he stirred its waves. Had Yuan not fled, how could he have failed to flee?"

Thus, without the summons to spare their father, the plan to attack Chu might have been delayed; without the flight of the Lord of Tang, Wu Zixu’s departure might not have been so swift. Heaven favors retribution, and principle follows echo—none can fathom how this comes to be.

The *Comprehensive Mirror* states: Tian Dan was a clansman of Qi, serving as a market officer in Linzi. When the people of Yan attacked Anping, Dan had his clansmen reinforce their chariot axles with iron bands. When the city fell, the people fought to escape through the gates, and their axles snapped, causing their chariots to break down and leaving them to be captured by Yan. Only Dan, with his iron-reinforced axles, escaped and fled to Jimo. At the time, all of Qi’s lands belonged to Yan except for Ju and Jimo, which remained unconquered. Yue Yi thus combined the right and front armies to besiege Ju, while the left and rear armies surrounded Jimo. The people of Jimo said: "In the battle of Anping, Tian Dan’s clansmen survived thanks to their iron bands—he is full of stratagems and skilled in warfare." They therefore made him their general to resist Yan.

The *Lu Record* says: "Yue Yi conquered over seventy cities, yet these two cities could not be subdued. What was the reason? Mencius’ words had already settled the matter—why seek further explanations? The enmity between Yan and Qi had festered for a long time. At its beginning, the fault lay with a single son, and it had nothing to do with the ancestral temples or altars of the state. In the end, the fault lay with King Min alone, and it had nothing to do with the ancestral temples or altars of the state. Had they executed that one son and sought a replacement, it would not have been for Qi’s sake; had they killed King Min and sought a replacement, it would not have been for Yan’s sake. Why then did the two states not act thus? In their invasion, they did not prioritize establishing a ruler but sought only to reach Yan. Thus, in their retaliation, they did not consider peaceful restoration but sought only to seize more. Had they followed Mencius’ counsel, there would have been no affair of Yue Yi, and what need would there have been for Ju and Jimo?"

Among the neighbors of Bi there was a litigant who, instead of addressing the grievance in his heart, clung to what he valued in secret. For years on end, the case remained unresolved, awaiting a reversal through coercion before it could be settled. Later, Tian Dan recovered all of Qi’s lost lands without coveting Yan’s gains, and only then did the enmity between Yan and Qi cease. This is what wisdom truly entails—it did not lie in the stratagem of iron bands.

Zhi Guo was the younger brother of Xuanzi. Initially, when Xuanzi’s son Yao was to be named heir, Guo said: "He is not as good as Xiao. Yao surpasses others in five ways but falls short in one. His fine beard and tall stature are virtues; his skill in archery, charioteering, and strength are virtues; his mastery of arts and readiness are virtues; his eloquence and intelligence are virtues; his resoluteness and daring are virtues. Yet he is utterly lacking in benevolence. With these five virtues, he will overpower others, but if he acts without benevolence, who will endure him? If Yao is established as heir, the Zhi clan will surely be destroyed." Xuanzi did not listen, so Guo separated his branch of the family in the grand historian’s records and renamed it Fu.

The *Lu Record* says: "How wise was Zhi Guo! His assessment of Yao was as clear as divining with tortoise shells. Why did Xuanzi not perceive this? The Way of benevolence has been obscured for a long time. If Lu’s ordinances could be called both fine and benevolent, could Yao’s virtues not be called benevolent? Yet if one does not examine his heart, then Jie was not lacking in eloquence and intelligence, Zhou was not lacking in resoluteness and daring, the Di were not lacking in fine beards and tall stature, Duan was not lacking in skill in archery and strength, and Nan Gong Changwan was not lacking in mastery of arts. Thus, in Confucius’ school, none spoke of the five virtues but took benevolence as the foundation. Without benevolence, the people cannot be preserved. Therefore, when the three families divided Jin, the hearts of the people were lost. How could one then occupy a lower position?"

Guo separated his clan and named it Fu to avoid the world’s hatred being directed at him.

The *Book of Han* states: Liu De was the son of Marquis Fu of Xiu. From a young age, he was astute and resourceful, often offering counsel. He was summoned to the Ganquan Palace, and Emperor Wu named him "the thousand-mile colt." At the beginning of Emperor Zhao’s reign, he served as assistant to the Minister of Ceremonies, then was promoted to Grand Master, and later returned to the Ministry of Ceremonies to investigate cases involving the Shangguan family. When Princess E was involved in affairs, De consistently adhered to Laozi’s principle of knowing contentment.

When his wife passed away, the Grand General Huo Guang wished to marry his daughter to him, but De declined the offer, fearing the perils of excessive prosperity. He often reproached Princess E’s grandson, Gai Chang, for his misconduct and held deep resentment toward him. Princess E’s grandson, Tan, intercepted De on the road, claiming to be an imperial attendant, and, believing Huo Guang’s displeasure at De’s refusal of his daughter stemmed from imperial directive, accused De of slander before the throne. De was imprisoned, stripped of his rank, and reduced to commoner status. Upon learning of this, Huo Guang regretted his actions and subsequently recommended De to serve as Acting Governor of Qingzhou, later reinstating him as Minister of the Imperial Clan.

When Emperor Xuan ascended the throne, De was enfeoffed as Marquis Within the Pass for his role in securing the succession, and later, in recognition of his kinship and virtuous conduct, was further honored as Marquis of Yangcheng. By nature, he was generous and kind, fond of aiding the living. Whenever he served as Prefect of the Capital, he frequently overturned unjust cases. Though his family wealth exceeded a million, he distributed it to relieve his kinsmen, guests, and retainers, saying, "This is how one averts the resentment of the wealthy."

The *Record* states: The *Great Learning* teaches: "What issues forth in defiance will return in defiance; what enters in defiance will depart in defiance." Wu’s defiance was indeed misguided, and propriety was not observed. Yet before long, Yan Shou met his demise—this was the consequence of defiance repaid. When Fu returned to the capital, he did not seek refuge in a distant land, which may be called prudent virtue. Thus, his son, too, knew contentment and restraint. This is how one discerns the origins of fortune and misfortune, the distinction between loyalty and arrogance. The sages of antiquity have long settled this truth, and it is not merely the teaching of Laozi.

In the fifth year of Yuan Kang during Emperor Xuan’s reign, when Emperor Yuan was still Crown Prince, Shu Guang served as Grand Tutor and his younger cousin, Shu Shou, as Junior Tutor. The Crown Prince, at twelve years of age, had already mastered the *Analects* and the *Classic of Filial Piety*. One day, Guang said to Shou: "I have heard that he who knows contentment avoids disgrace, and he who knows when to stop avoids peril. Now, I have risen to a salary rank of two thousand *shi*, achieved official success, and established my reputation. If I do not retire at this juncture, I fear future regret." That very day, both submitted memorials claiming illness and requested to return their bones to the soil. The emperor granted their pleas, bestowing upon them twenty catties of gold, while the Crown Prince presented fifty. The court officials and old friends prepared a farewell feast with elaborate decorations at the Eastern Capital Gate. Hundreds of carriages came to see them off, and onlookers along the road exclaimed, "How virtuous are these two great men!" Some sighed in admiration, and others wept in sorrow. Upon returning to their hometown, they sold their gold to purchase wine, inviting kinsmen, old friends, and guests to share in joyous celebration.

Some urged Guang to use his gold to establish substantial property for his descendants, but Guang replied: "Do you take me for a senile fool who does not think of his children and grandchildren? I already possess old fields and a homestead; if my descendants work diligently there, it will suffice to provide clothing and food, placing them on par with ordinary folk. To further increase their wealth would only breed indolence. The virtuous, when burdened with excess wealth, feel shame at the erosion of their resolve; the foolish, when enriched, only deepen their faults. Moreover, wealth invites the resentment of the multitude. Since I lack the means to instruct my descendants in virtue, I would not add to their faults and provoke enmity. As for this gold, it is the sagely ruler’s gift to nourish an aged minister. Is it not fitting that I share its bounty with my village kin and clan, thus spending my remaining days in joy?"

The record states: The abrupt resignation of the two Shus served as a rebuke to the precedent set by Huo Guang. Their refusal to amass property likewise exposed the folly of Yu Yunshan. Before them, Zhang Anshi had acted similarly; after them, Wang Ji followed suit, both adhering to the principle that "knowing contentment averts disgrace, knowing when to stop averts peril." Yet it was not that these two foresaw the untrustworthiness of the Crown Prince. Another passage remarks: How could Xiao Wangzhi be compared to the Shus? Wangzhi, upon learning that Han Yanshou would succeed him and that Feng Lan possessed a reputation surpassing his own, grew envious and sought to entrap them in legal transgressions. The two Shus, by contrast, were preoccupied with the fear that excess wealth would compound their descendants’ faults and breed resentment—would they ever engage in such mutual recrimination?

When Hong Xian framed Wangzhi, it was akin to Yanshou’s fate upon hearing the news—neither outcome was the emperor’s doing. Feng Yeshu’s father, Feng Fengshi, had served as General and Grand Master of Ceremonies, and Yeshu himself later became Left Fengyi. Father and son both held court positions, and critics praised their competence as befitting their offices, not the result of feminine favor. When Yeshu was promoted to Grand Herald and dispatched as Governor of Shang Commandery, his governance was ranked first. His younger brother, Feng Li, served as Governor of Pingyuan and later succeeded Yeshu in Shang Commandery. In office, Li was publicly upright and governed with a clemency akin to his brother’s, though he was more astute and generous, fond of issuing systematic instructions. The officials and people praised him, singing: "Great Lord Feng, Little Lord Feng, brothers in succession, one after the other, wise and virtuous, bestowing grace upon the people, their virtue and transformation like that of Lu and Wei, even the Duke of Zhou and Kang Shu cannot surpass these two lords." Alongside their brother Feng Bian, they were renowned in their time, each governing five commanderies and invariably achieving the highest evaluations in their posts.

The record states: In my humble view, while all deemed the Junqing brothers more worthy than the officials of Bohai, I would argue they were less adept at securing their own futures. Why? They declared: "All men seek favor and rank, but we alone embrace lowliness, for as brothers of the imperial in-laws, we cannot hold pivotal positions." Alas, such words betray a submission to the times. Had they not bowed to the era, they would have either become one of the Five Marquises or joined the ranks of Ding and Fu—how could they be called wise? By then, the royal net was in disarray; even Feng Meng and Mei Fu feared they had acted too late. How could earthworms linger in the damp? This is why Wu Zhangxu of Tang stood apart, beyond emulation.

In his youth, Ma Yuan, finding his family’s resources insufficient, asked his elder brother Shi to release him from his duties so he might seek land and livestock on the frontier. Shi replied: "You are a man of great talent, destined for late success. A true king does not flaunt his unpolished worth—follow your inclinations." Yuan thus went to Beidi to farm and herd. Once, addressing his guests, he declared: "A true man’s resolve grows firmer in adversity and stronger in old age." Later, when he possessed thousands of livestock and tens of thousands of *hu* of grain, he sighed and said: "Wealth is merely accumulated property, its value lying in relief and generosity. Otherwise, one is but a miser guarding his coins." He then distributed all his wealth among his relatives and old friends.

Hearing that Yin Xiu was fond of scholars, Ma Yuan went to join him, and Xiu held him in great esteem, consulting him on strategy. Lu remarked: "Observing Ma Kuang’s words, I sigh at how difficult it is for a great tree to meet a skilled craftsman. For Yuan lived in the time of Wang Mang, when the realm offered no refuge. Thus, when abroad, he became a Ji Tang; when at home, a Gong Bao. Had he resigned himself to old age and poverty, would he not have ended his days herding and farming in the borderlands? Yet in the end, by the rise of the Dragon in Nanyang, he became a general and minister, his name inscribed on bamboo and silk; his daughter became an imperial consort, her virtue foremost in the rear palace. Was his late success ordinary? Therefore, one must not judge a scholar by the speed of his rise, nor cling stubbornly to one’s lot—for such is the resolve of a true man, and one must not fail to hold oneself in high regard."

According to the *Book of the Later Han*: Liu Xiu, Prince of Dongping, was fond of the classics from youth, possessed keen intelligence, and was kind and handsome, with a beard and broad forehead. His waist measured eight spans, and Emperor Ming held him in great esteem, appointing him General of the Swift Cavalry, his rank above the Three Excellencies. At that time, the dynasty had been restored for over thirty years, and the realm was at peace. The Prince, believing the world well-ordered, advocated the revival of ritual and music. Together with the high ministers, he established the rites for the southern and northern suburban sacrifices, as well as the regulations for crowns, robes, carriages, and court attire. He also determined the number of dancers for the eight-row formations in the Guangwu Emperor’s temple. Whenever the Emperor traveled, the Prince was often left to guard the capital. After the Empress Dowager had reigned for several years, contributing much to the state, the Prince, though closely related to the throne, grew uneasy with his growing influence. He submitted a memorial to resign his duties, offering to return his seals and retire to his fief. The Emperor, in a gracious edict, refused, but the Prince persisted earnestly. After five years, he was permitted to return to his principality, though he was not allowed to relinquish his general’s seal. His Chief Clerk was made Minister of Works for Dongping, his Attendant Officer became a Palace Gentleman, and his Clerks became Gentlemen of the Royal Household. He was further granted 200,000 cash and 100,000 bolts of cloth.

Lu remarked: "Since the decline of the Zhou house, the prestige of the Ji and Shao clans has also waned. Since the rise of the Han, no imperial kinsmen have been allowed to hold the highest offices—only the relatives of empresses have been so entrusted. Yet are not the mother’s kin even more distant than those who share the same vital breath? All these errors stem from partiality, from favoring those one loves and delights in. Thus, the self is not cultivated, the family is not ordered, the state cannot be governed, and the realm cannot be pacified—disaster and chaos inevitably follow. The sages warned of this long ago, and the Western Han repeated their mistakes. Only later, after changing course, did the situation under Emperors Zhang and He gradually return to the ways of old."

Li Gu’s daughter, Wenji, was the wife of Zhao Boying of the same commandery. She was virtuous and wise. When Gu was dismissed from office, Wenji, foreseeing disaster, lamented: "The Li house is doomed. Since the time of our ancestor, we have accumulated virtue and benevolence—why must we meet such a fate?" Gu had a young son, Xie, whom she secretly planned to hide. Soon after, the catastrophe struck, and her two elder brothers were killed. Wenji told her father’s disciple, Wang Cheng: "Our late father embodied the integrity of the ancients. I entrust you with this duty: take in this orphan of six *chi*, for the survival or extinction of the Li house rests with you." Moved by her righteousness, Cheng took Xie and fled eastward by boat, entering the borders of Xuzhou. They changed their names, Xie becoming a servant in a tavern, while Cheng told fortunes in the market, each pretending to be strangers while secretly keeping in touch. Xie studied under Cheng, and the tavern keeper, impressed by him, married his daughter to him. For over a decade, Xie devoted himself to the classics.

After Liang Ji was executed, omens of disaster appeared repeatedly. The court historians advised that an amnesty should be granted to preserve the descendants of wronged ministers. Thus, a general pardon was issued, and the search for Gu’s heirs began. Xie then revealed his true identity to the tavern keeper and returned to his hometown. When brother and sister met, their grief moved all who witnessed it. Wenji then warned Xie: "Our late father was a loyal minister of the Han. Now the court is in turmoil, and Liang Ji runs rampant—our ancestral sacrifices are about to be cut off. That you have survived is surely heaven’s will. You must sever ties with others, avoid reckless associations, and never utter a word against the Liang clan. Acknowledge only your own faults." Xie carefully heeded her advice.

Lu remarked: "In comparing the wisdom of Li Wenji with the charm of Cai Wenji, can they truly be spoken of in the same breath? Caution in self-preservation is called wisdom; pleasing others is called cleverness. The differences between the two women reflect the distinctions between people. Yet though Gu’s calamity was deep and Wenji’s foresight keen, what could they ultimately do?"

The father refused to enthrone the Emperor, and now the son refuses to enthrone the king—what failure to take warning has brought us to this? As for Xie, not only has his family long upheld integrity through the generations, but he may truly be called one whose virtue shines with the brilliance of bestowed favor.

**Trust**
**The Trust Between Ruler and Minister**

*Lushi* states: During the seventy years of Yao’s reign, the people did not resort to arms, pheasants and magpies fled to the remotest regions, and qilin roamed the marshes—this was because he was trusted by the people.

The record states: What is meant by "embodying trust and achieving harmony" is that harmony is what heaven assists, and trust is what people assist. As a ruler, Yao, by embodying what heaven assists, caused the two forces to respond in harmony, all living things to flourish, qi to flow without obstruction, and the four spiritual creatures to appear. By embodying what people assist, his wisdom and insight were sufficient to oversee all, and his magnanimity and gentleness were sufficient to embrace all. Thus, taking heaven and earth as his foundation, all things could be governed; taking yin and yang as his starting point, all emotions could be ordered; taking the four seasons as his handle, all labors could be encouraged; and taking the sun and stars as his guide, all affairs could be arranged and all achievements recorded. Taking ghosts and spirits as his companions, all affairs could be preserved and all actions verified; taking human sentiment as his field, the people did not resort to arms; and taking the four spiritual creatures as his livestock, pheasants and magpies fled to the wilds while qilin appeared in the outskirts.

*The Doctrine of the Mean* says: "In this way, though unseen, it is manifest; though unmoving, it transforms; though inactive, it accomplishes." This is how the sage-kings of high antiquity matched heaven, partook of the sacrifices to the Supreme Emperor, and served as the masters of the Three Powers, becoming models for the rulers of all ages.

*The Doctrine of the Mean* further states: "In governing the world, there are three essential matters. Those who are sparing in errors excel in them. The highest, though good, lacks proof; if proof is not trusted, the people will not follow. The lowest, though good, lacks dignity; without dignity, it is not trusted, and if not trusted, the people will not follow." Thus, the Way of the noble person is rooted in the self, verified among the common people, examined against the Three Kings without error, established in heaven and earth without contradiction, tested before ghosts and spirits without doubt, and awaits the sages of a hundred generations without confusion. Therefore, when the noble person acts, the world takes it as its Way; when he moves, the world takes it as its law; when he speaks, the world takes it as its standard. From afar, he is admired; up close, he is not resented.

*The Book of Songs* says:
*"There, none find him hateful;
Here, none find him wearisome.
Day and night, he strives
To long preserve his good name."*

No noble person has ever gained renown in the world without first embodying this.

The record states: Speaking of the three essential matters, when Shun refined the five rites—five jades, three silks, two living animals, and one sacrificial victim—he presented them like the five ritual vessels to deliberate on propriety. He harmonized the seasons and months, standardized the calendar, and unified the measures of pitch pipes, weights, and volumes to establish institutions. He disseminated proposals in words and tested them by merit to examine culture. Confucius traced his lineage back to Yao and Shun, hence his caution in these matters, despite possessing virtue without position. Through these six affairs, he bequeathed teachings to all generations. Though he could not gain trust in his own time, he truly earned renown throughout the world. To this day, his actions serve as the Way for all generations, his words as their law, and his conduct as their standard—far beyond a single era.

Later examples, such as the rituals of Mian Zhuo, the infrequent systems of the Han, the characters of Wutai, and the texts of the *New Classics*, though unrelated to the six affairs, may have deceived people’s eyes and ears and blinded their hearts for a time, yet they could not earn true renown in the world. Thus, they perished swiftly, vanishing together. Then, were the words of the six affairs truly trustworthy or not? If one holds the power of creation, one cannot evade this responsibility.

*The Analects* records: Zigong asked about governance. The Master said, "Sufficient food, sufficient arms, and the people’s trust." Zigong said, "If forced to relinquish one of these three, which should go first?" The Master said, "Relinquish arms." Zigong said, "If forced to relinquish one of the remaining two, which should go first?" The Master said, "Relinquish food. From ancient times, all must die; without the people’s trust, the state cannot stand."

The record states: This discourse transcends past and present. Many have debated arms and food through the ages, but who would dare abandon them? Yet the Master and Zigong pursued the matter to its ultimate conclusion. In making such a statement, was there no subtlety in their trustworthiness? The eras of Qin and Sui serve as proof.

Since the time of Shang Yang, the Qin abandoned trust and righteousness, focusing solely on wealth and power. The First Emperor further established an unshakable foundation—what could he not relinquish when forced? Yet when a commoner raised a cry, the people could only die—how could the state stand? The Sui, following the Six Dynasties, boasted of strength surpassing all previous ages—what could they not relinquish when forced? They stored grain at Luokou, allowing the people to take it freely, yet this abundance was in vain. Only when the Three Articles of Law were established did the people begin to revive; when prisoners returned, the people no longer rushed to their deaths. Trust cannot be abandoned.

Thus, though arms and food are relied upon by all, and life and death are known to all, without trust, they cannot rely on one another or know one another. Hence, in critical moments, trust is paramount.

It is also said: "If a person lacks trustworthiness, how can they be of use? A great cart without its yoke-tie, a small cart without its crossbar—how can they move?" Alas! Knowing that a cart cannot move without these, one understands why the people cannot stand without trust.

*The Outer Records* state: When Yu went out and saw a criminal, he dismounted, questioned him, and wept. His attendants said, "This man has violated the Way—why does the lord grieve for him?" Yu replied, "The people of Yao and Shun took the hearts of Yao and Shun as their own hearts."

The ruler, being a lord, weeps for the people because each takes their own heart as their heart. The *Records* state: This shows that the people cannot stand without trust. That the people of Yao and Shun all took the hearts of Yao and Shun as their own hearts was because ruler and subject were united in trust. The ruler, being a lord, sees the people each take their own hearts as their hearts—this is because without trust, the people do not follow. Though there be court assemblies, lawsuits, feasts, and songs, they do not return to the standard of Shun but are compared to Yu. When the common people undergo change and the four auspicious winds stir, questions arise. The lords of the ages after the Three Dynasties cannot but place the people deep in their hearts and minds.

Mencius said: When Tang first campaigned, beginning with Ge, the world trusted him. When he turned east to campaign, the western Yi complained; when he turned south to campaign, the northern Di complained, saying, "Why leave us for last?" The people longed for him as those in great drought long for clouds and rainbows. Those returning from the market did not stop; those plowing did not change their course. He punished their lords and comforted their people, like timely rain falling—great was the people’s joy. The *Records* state: Between Tang and Yu, there is also a question. As it is said, "Heaven and the people turned to him"—this speaks of his ultimate end. Had he, at the outset of his campaigns, lacked trust with the people, how could he have justified himself before the world and posterity?

The *Book of Documents* says: "Be tolerant and kind, manifesting trust to the myriad people." Mencius’s words take their foundation from this. How can one compare them to the lords of the Warring States, who acted unjustly, killed the innocent, failed to win the trust of the world, and merely gratified their momentary desires?

*Tai Jia* says: "Only Yi Yin first appeared in the western city of Xia. From the Zhou onward, those who had a good end had ministers who also had a good end. The later successor kings could not have a good end, and their ministers likewise could not have a good end. Let the successor kings take heed!" The *Records* state: Mencius said, "One with the resolve of Yi Yin may be released." He said: "Yi Yin’s resolve was to take the public good of the world as his heart, without a single mote of self-interest." I deem that when Yi Yin first exiled Tai Jia, people trusted that he had not a single shred of self-interest—this began with these words.

Those who, as ministers, usurp their lord’s authority to shield their ruler—were they only Li Si and Zhao Gao of Qin? The affairs of Yi and Mi serve as a mirror. At that time, Tai Jia, entrusting Yi Yin with the weight of the world, thought that even if he indulged his desires, he would not immediately perish. Yet Yi Yin, as minister, warned him of the failure to have a good end, admonishing him to deeply examine his self-interest and break his reliance. Had men like Wang Mang, Cao Cao, or Sima Yi been in his place, what would they have done? Thus we know the hearts of sages and worthies truly can establish heaven and earth and serve as the substance of ghosts and spirits. Though a hundred generations await the sage, their clarity shines forth without doubt—how could they not be trustworthy?

It further says: "Let the lord not use clever words to disrupt old policies; let the minister not use favor and profit to claim success. Then the state will long be blessed with good fortune." The *Records* state: This was when Yi Yin returned the government to Tai Jia, and people trusted that he had not a single shred of self-interest. Those who employ cunning, disrupt old institutions, and use favor and profit to claim success—were they only Duke Xiao’s Shang Yang? To deceive Heaven above and curry favor with the powerful while rejecting the worthy—the affairs of Jie serve as a mirror.

Though Yi Yin held the weight of the *Aheng* and had the authority to restore order, had he harbored even a shred of desire for favor or profit, what would he not have done? Yet his heart was tranquil and content, no different from when he had tilled the fields. No sooner had his work succeeded than he retired, owing no debt to the former kings above, nor to Tai Jia in the middle, nor to the people below. Thus, like the bright sun in a clear sky, his loyalty and uprightness shone forth; heaven and earth, ghosts and spirits, bore witness to his brilliance; and from ancient times to the present, the world admires his breadth of mind.

Even men like Cai Ze knew the sequence of the four seasons—how could others be different? Yet Shang Yang suffered dismemberment by chariot, and the Five Princes were exiled and rescued—such cases are many. Are they not the guilty ones before Yi Yin?

The *Counsels of Gao Yao* says: The king treasured his sorrow and observed mourning for three years. After the mourning period ended, he still did not speak. All the ministers remonstrated with the king. The king then composed a text to proclaim: "I, the One Man, rectify the four quarters. I fear my virtue does not match, so I have not spoken. Reverently and silently, I ponder the Way. In a dream, the Lord charged me with a good assistant to speak in my stead." He then examined the image, had it depicted, and sought throughout the world. Yue, building walls in the wilds of Fu Rock, was the very likeness.

The *Records* state: How did Gao Zong come to have such a dream? His heart of utmost sincerity merged with Heaven, and the resonance of his spirit and the sincerity of his thoughts and concerns were such that they came about without his knowing why. Moreover, how did the image come to be? The records of true principle take form everywhere, and the signs of their emergence and the reasons for their exact likeness likewise come about without his knowing why.

The Way lies in non-action and non-thought, in stillness and motionlessness. Had there been even a hint of scheming, a slight display outwardly, a single word taken in first, or the slightest stirring within, others could have perceived his flaw and exploited it. Duke Xiao of Qin, resolved to change the laws and alter the decrees, allowed Shang Yang to sell his schemes. Emperor Shenzong of Song, resolved to investigate antiquity and act, allowed Wang Anshi to advance his treachery. The two rulers, in appointing their ministers, thought them worthy, yet in dreams and divination, they did not know—they were deceived by spirits.

Only then do we know that the heart of reverent silence and pondering the Way truly joins with Heaven and Earth and communicates with ghosts and spirits. Otherwise, how could men like Deng Tong with Emperor Wen or Wang Liang with Emperor Guangwu have won the trust of later ages? They are few indeed.

From the *Missing "Jin Teng" Chapter of the Book of Zhou*: In autumn, the harvest ripened, yet before it could be reaped, heaven sent great thunder and lightning with wind, flattening all the grain, uprooting great trees, and striking terror into the people of the state. The king and his ministers, donning ceremonial caps, opened the golden-bound coffer and found therein the record of the Duke of Zhou’s merit, his plea to take King Wu’s place in death. The two dukes and the king then inquired of the historians and all the officials. They replied, “It is true.” Alas! The Duke had commanded us never to speak of it. The king, holding the document and weeping, said, “Let us no longer divine with milfoil. In the past, the Duke labored diligently for the royal house, yet I, in my youth, failed to understand. Now heaven displays its majesty to manifest the Duke’s virtue. I, the little son, shall personally welcome him, and our state’s rites shall duly honor him.” The king went out to the suburbs, whereupon heaven sent rain, the wind reversed, and the grain all stood upright again. The two dukes commanded the people to raise and rebuild every tree that had been felled, and the year yielded a great harvest.

The record states: Master Zhang said, “Will and qi, heaven and man—there is a principle of mutual overcoming. When the sage is on the throne and slander arises, it is the stirring of qi that unsettles the will. When the heart of heaven responds and thunder and wind arise, it is the will that stirs qi. Thus we see that in the flourishing age of the Three Dynasties, ruler and minister were in perfect accord, their sincere hearts and true intentions flowing between high and low, like yin and yang in motion and stillness, each rooted in the other. For those who fail to grasp this, a single inquiry suffices. In later ages, yin waxes while yang wanes, heaven and earth do not commune, high and low grow estranged. Witness Emperor Ling of Han, who pardoned the partisans because of the Yellow Turban rebellion, or Emperor Huizong of Song, who lifted the stele prohibitions due to the appearance of a comet—how far they fell behind! Those who stumble in their steps and let their hearts be swayed—how can they not gaze at heaven in bewilderment?”

From the *Spring and Autumn Annals*: In the first year of Duke Yin of Lu, in spring, the third month, the Duke and Yiyi Fu of Zhu made a covenant at Mie.

The record states: Confucius said, “Since ancient times, all must die; but without trust, the people cannot stand.” The commentators explain: “Better to die than lose trust with the people, so that the people, too, would rather die than lose trust with me. If I would rather die than lose trust with the people, why should others demand pledges from me? If the people would rather die than lose trust with me, why should I demand pledges from them? Such was governance in antiquity. When the age declines and the Way decays, the ruler does not trust his ministers—how much less a neighboring state! A father does not trust his son—how much less a stranger! Thus, the practices of pledges and covenants proliferate. The Master composed the *Spring and Autumn Annals* to make trust the great treasure of rulers. Therefore, he first recorded the covenant at Mie, intending that later rulers and ministers would hold fast to this principle, firm as metal and stone, and guard it steadfastly, as constant as the four seasons. Thereby they might discipline their mutual resolve, align the wills of high and low, preserve the Way of beginning and end, and forestall the seeds of reversal. His intent in bequeathing this teaching to the world was most profound.

Yet did Duke Yin of Lu truly uphold trust? When profit and harm stir within, public and private become divided without; when a false heart lurks at the outset, betrayal appears in the end. Yin feigned deference to make a show of righteousness, and adorned his consent to make a show of trust. Observe how he first made the covenant at Mie, then later launched an attack on Zhu—his true nature is plain to see. The *Poetry* says, ‘The nobleman makes covenants time and again, and disorder only grows thereby.’ Does this not refer to such cases?”

From the *Zuo Tradition*: Duke Wu and Duke Zhuang of Zheng served as ministers to King Ping of Zhou. The king divided his favor toward Guo, so the Earl of Zheng resented him. The king said, “I have done no such thing.” Thus, Zhou and Zheng exchanged hostages: Prince Hu of Zhou went to Zheng as hostage, and Prince Ignorant of Zheng went to Zhou as hostage. When the king died, the people of Zhou intended to demote Guo and entrust governance to him. In the fourth month, Zhai Zu of Zheng led troops to seize the wheat at Wen; in autumn, they seized the grain at Chengzhou, and Zhou and Zheng grew mutually hostile.

The noble man says: “If trust does not arise from within, hostages are of no benefit. Act with clarity and forbearance, and bind it with ritual—even without hostages, who could challenge it? If there is true trust, the grasses of mountain streams and marshy pools, the water-plants and algae of ponds and ditches, the vessels of baskets and earthenware, the water of flowing gutters and stagnant puddles—these may be offered to ghosts and spirits, presented as delicacies to kings and dukes. How much more, when a noble man establishes trust between two states and conducts himself with ritual—what need has he for hostages?”

The *Airs* contain “Gathering the Fennel” and “Gathering the Water-Plant,” while the *Odes* contain “Walking Among the Reeds” and “Pouring from the Gorge.” These all illuminate loyalty and trust.

The record states: “‘Gathering the Fennel,’ ‘Gathering the Water-Plant,’ ‘Walking Among the Reeds,’ and ‘Pouring from the Gorge’ are all poems of Zhou. Yet by its decline, sons did not trust their fathers, and ‘The Little Grievance’ was composed; wives did not trust their husbands, and ‘The White Blossoms’ was composed.”

That King You of Zhou was a son by blood, flesh and bone, yet he deposed and murdered him—where then lay the safety of Prince Hu of Zheng and Prince Hu of Zheng? This is why hostages were exchanged in such profusion, and why enmity repeatedly flared. The words of *Master Zuo* are thus a lament for the divergence of order and disorder.

Mencius said: “Of the Five Hegemons, Duke Huan of Qi was the greatest. At the Assembly of Kuiqiu, the feudal lords bound their sacrificial animals and inscribed their pledges without even smearing their mouths with blood. The first decree proclaimed: ‘Punish the unfilial; do not alter the heir apparent; do not make a concubine your wife.’ The second decree proclaimed: ‘Honor the worthy and nurture talent to manifest virtue.’ The third decree proclaimed: ‘Revere the aged and cherish the young; do not neglect guests and travelers.’ The fourth decree proclaimed: ‘Scholars shall not hold hereditary office; official duties shall not be concurrently held; select officials with care; do not execute great officers arbitrarily.’ The fifth decree proclaimed: ‘Do not bend embankments to your will; do not block the sale of grain; do not enfeoff without reporting to the Son of Heaven.’ It concluded: ‘All who share this covenant, after swearing this oath, shall return to amity like the waters of Yu.’”

The record states: The one who later commended Duke Huan of Qi was Zai Kong; the one who first returned to meet the Lord of Jin was also this same Zai Kong. At first, he feared the Son of Heaven’s majesty; in the end, he made clear the Son of Heaven’s prohibitions—how then could he have deemed the assembly unnecessary?

Mencius said: “The reverent do not insult others; the frugal do not seize from others. A lord who insults and seizes from others fears only that his subjects will not submit. How could such a one truly be called reverent and frugal? Reverence and frugality cannot be feigned with mere voice and smile.”

Though Zai Kong was a minister of the royal court and never wielded power like Guan Zhong, he had thoroughly studied Duke Huan’s intentions. Thus, when the Duke vented his fury at Shao Ji’s northern campaign, or when he honored Chu for attacking the Mountain Rong only to turn north and scheme against Yan—at this very assembly, he dazzled the eyes and ears of men and delighted their hearts, yet in Zai Kong’s eyes, he was as transparent as if his lungs and liver were exposed. This is why the sages of antiquity devoted themselves to cultivating virtue and guarding their solitude. Even when they possessed two-thirds of the realm, they still served the Yin with deference.

Alas! The supreme virtue of Zhou—how could it have fallen behind others in its words and deeds?

In the winter of the thirteenth year of Duke Zhuang, the Duke met with the Lord of Qi and swore an alliance at Ke. The *Gongyang Commentary* asks: “Why is the date not recorded? Because it was an easy matter. How so? Duke Huan’s alliances did not record dates, and his assemblies did not require full attendance—this was a sign of trust. The omission of dates began here.”

When Duke Zhuang was about to meet with Duke Huan, Caozi stepped forward and asked: “What is Your Lordship’s intention?” Duke Zhuang replied: “In life, I am no better off than dead.” Caozi said: “Then let Your Lordship confront his lord as a lord, and let your servant confront his minister as a minister.” Duke Zhuang said: “Very well.”

At the meeting, Duke Zhuang ascended the altar, with Caozi following, sword in hand. Guanzi stepped forward and asked: “What does Your Lordship seek?” Caozi replied: “The city walls have collapsed and pressed upon our borders—why has your lord not addressed this?” Guanzi said: “Then what does Your Lordship demand?” Caozi said: “I request the fields of Wenyang.” Guanzi turned and said: “Your Lordship consents.” Duke Huan said: “I consent.”

Caozi then demanded an oath, and Duke Huan descended to swear with him. After the oath, Caozi brandished his sword and departed. Though the oath could have been violated, Duke Huan did not deceive; though Caozi’s demand could have been refused, Duke Huan’s trust became renowned throughout the world, beginning with the Alliance at Ke.

The record states: This was a minor minister of Lu, yet the hegemon humbled himself to comply—was this not trust? No. Guan Zhong said: “To grant what is requested is the treasure of seizing power.”

After the Battle of Changshao, Cao’s schemes had nearly crippled Qi. When Qi missed the Assembly of Beixing, Duke Huan and four other states were slighted, and Lu could not be pacified. Guan Zhong’s foresight was as clear as Zhu’s. Lu was the ancestral state; Qi had murdered its lord and violated its lady. At the Assembly of Ke, Duke Zhuang deemed life worse than death—was this not a shameful oath? Had Lu used this to punish Qi, even if it had to endure humiliation before the feudal lords, how could it have won the hearts of the world? How base were those schemes!

Wielding a sword is the courage of a commoner; the fields of Wenyang are but a trifling morsel. The entire state followed this misguided path, with neither lord nor minister discerning the grand strategy. They cast aside petty gains to steal a resounding reputation. Thus Guanzi said: “To grant what is requested is the treasure of seizing power.” Was this not Guanzi’s foresight?

The Lord of Jin besieged Yuan, ordering provisions for three days. When Yuan did not surrender, he ordered a retreat. As the troops withdrew, it was said: “Yuan is about to surrender.” The officers said: “Let us wait a little longer.” The Duke said: “Trust is the treasure of the state, the refuge of the people. To gain Yuan but lose trust—how could we shelter the people? What we would lose would be far greater.” They withdrew thirty *li*, and Yuan surrendered.

The record states: Duke Wen’s achievements were indeed great, but they were merely the duties of a minister and son—how could Jin have taken the Son of Heaven’s four cities? Zhou’s territory was no larger than Cao or Teng, its people no more numerous than those of Guo or Ju. Any man of conscience would not have entertained such thoughts—how could he bear to further divide what little remained?

Yuan had committed no act of rebellion; its defenders were guarding it for the king. The court had lost the Way and pressured them, forcing them to rebel and follow ruin. Alas for the Lord of Yuan! Had Duke Wen rectified the royal domain, he could have repelled the encroachments of the feudal lords. Had he attacked in this manner, his trust would have shone like the sun and moon. Instead, he ignored the people’s sentiments and indulged in hegemonic ambition—this was “clever in employing words,” not “enlightened in upholding trust.”

Prince Hu of Zhou swore an alliance with the feudal lords in the royal court, with this essential pledge: “All shall assist the royal house and not harm one another. If any violate this oath, may the bright spirits punish them, casting down their armies and cutting short their state’s lineage, so that even their distant descendants, young and old alike, shall perish.”

The gentleman deems this alliance trustworthy, and deems Jin’s conduct in this campaign an attack by virtue. It is recorded: At the Assembly of Kuiqiu, the feudal lords sought the sacrificial beast and inscribed the pledge, yet did not smear their mouths with blood—such was the awe and trust Duke Huan inspired, that he needed not wait for their words to be spoken. At the Alliance of Jiantu, Zheng and Wei wrangled endlessly—such was Duke Wen’s insatiable demand for gain, heedless of the king’s diminished authority. Thus, ere the blood on their lips had dried, each man’s heart had already turned to his own concerns. Where then was their shared support for the royal house? Where then was the pledge to extend to distant descendants? Viewed together, one may see that one hegemon was not the equal of the next.

In the fourth year of Duke Dao of Jin, Wei Jiang served as Minister of War. The ruler of Wuzhong sent his minister Meng Le to present tiger and leopard pelts and sue for peace with the Rong tribes. The Duke said: “The Yi and Di are faithless and greedy. Better to attack them.” Wei Jiang replied: “The Two Lords have newly submitted, and Chen has newly come to make peace. They will observe our virtue. If we act with virtue, they will be harmonious; if not, they will grow estranged. To exhaust our forces against the Rong while Chu attacks Chen would leave us unable to save Chen—this would be to abandon it. All the Central States would surely rebel. The Rong are but beasts. To gain the Rong but lose the Hua—would this not be unwise?” The Duke said: “Then what of making peace with the Rong?” Wei Jiang replied: “Peace with the Rong brings five advantages. The Rong and Di are nomads who value goods and readily exchange land—thus land may be purchased: this is the first. The borderlands will no longer be alarmed, the people will grow familiar with the wilderness, and the farmers will reap success: this is the second. The Rong and Di will serve Jin, the neighboring states will be stirred, and the feudal lords will hold our might in awe: this is the third. By virtue we pacify the Rong, our troops will not be wearied, and our armor and weapons will not be deployed: this is the fourth. Taking the fall of Hou Yi as a warning and employing virtue and restraint, distant lands will come and near lands will be secure: this is the fifth. Let Your Lordship consider this.” The Duke was pleased and sent Wei Jiang to make an alliance with the Rong.

The Record states: In my humble observation of the Spring and Autumn period, Wei Jiang secured peace with the various Rong and Di tribes through five advantages—why should our own age be any different? Jin occupied what is now Shanxi, its territory then governed by the Ministry of Announcement. At the time, it was called unrivaled in strength; today, it is but a single regional bulwark. Though Wei Jiang was renowned for his strategic acumen, he would now be no more than a minor attendant minister. Yet the respite he brought to the border commanderies was immense. The responsibility was not that of the Wu Zhong clan, the calamity not comparable to the abandonment of Chen, nor the gains and losses akin to forsaking Hua for the Rong. If we harass them year after year, when will it ever cease? If we drive them from place to place, where will it end? The benefits and harms are too numerous to count.

Thus, valuing goods in exchange for land is a sentiment shared by all Yi and Di; the success of the farmers and the reliance of the borderlands are mutual. How could this be true only of Wei Jiang’s words? Rather than squandering incalculable expenses to maintain idle garrison troops, would it not be better to follow the precedent of former dynasties and emulate the achievement of peace with the Rong? Even the leather of sheep and dogs has its proper use. For our present strategy, why not dispatch a single envoy of communication to the assembly point of the Three Lu tribes, binding them with trust, winning them with kindness, and enticing them with profit? Let us maintain our old borders as boundaries, allowing them to withdraw far away and follow their own customs. Each year, on a designated month and day, let them meet at a specified border point. At that time, we shall tighten our defenses, fortify our outposts, display our might, and ensure they harbor no intent to belittle the Middle Kingdom. During all other months, they must not approach the border passes, lurk in river bends, or encamp in the Ordos. Command their chieftains to enforce these orders, so that all people along the frontier may rest. When our military strength is fully restored, our provisions ample, and our trust unshaken, we may then gradually plan a distant campaign—whether like Emperor Chengzu’s proclamation of might in the desert or the Great Han’s inscription of merit on Yanran Mountain. Is this not the most essential strategy?

To neglect this and instead drift through the years, counting mere survival as achievement—now halting troops, now reinforcing defenses, with no reliable plan—is a shortsighted policy, not the way of an emperor who subdues enemies without battle. In my waning years, with no opportunity to offer counsel, I record these thoughts, inspired by Wei Jiang’s proposal, to express my earnest intent.

When Zhao Meng grew anxious over the armored troops of Chu, he informed Shu Xiang, who replied: “What harm is there? If even a common man breaks his word once, it is unacceptable. How much worse if the ministers of the feudal lords collectively act in bad faith? They will surely fail. Those who break their word suffer no ill—this is not your concern. To summon others with trust and then betray them is to ensure no one will stand with you. How could they harm us?” At the meeting at Hao, Qi Wu said to Zhao Wenzi: “At the Alliance of Song, the men of Chu had their way with Jin. Now the Chief Minister’s lack of trust is known to all the feudal lords. You should be on guard.” Yet, as with Zimu of Song, whose trust was praised by his followers, they still outpaced Jin—how much more so with one so egregiously untrustworthy? Wenzi replied: “I have received your counsel. However, at the Alliance of Song, Zimu harbored malicious intent, while I acted with benevolence. This is why Chu outpaced Jin. Now, I still hold that same heart, while Chu continues its deceit. It poses no threat. I will take trust as my foundation and act accordingly. Like a farmer who plows and weeds, though there may be famine, there will surely be years of plenty. Moreover, I have heard that one who keeps faith will not be subordinate to others—I have not yet achieved this. As the *Book of Songs* says: ‘Without deceit or harm, few do not take it as a model.’ Trust is the way.”

The Record states: Lü of Lai in Shulai claimed that Zhao Wenzi handled the crisis of the armored troops with ease, as if he truly understood Wenzi. Yet he did not grasp that trust was Wenzi’s guiding principle, and thus he had nothing to fear. Mencius said: “I understand words, and I nourish my vast and unyielding qi.” Zimu’s greed and ambition for dominance foretold his impending doom—even his peers knew this, and Wenzi knew it well. Hence it is said: “He alone met his end.” And again: “Those who break their word suffer no ill.” Though Wenzi appeared frail, as if he could not bear his robes, and reticent, as if he could not speak, he stilled the weapons and pacified the people, while Chu’s hostility grew ever more dire. How distant was his resolve! To abandon trust upon gaining power, or to provoke conflict without redress—how could this come first? Wenzi’s inner resolve was firm, but his established principles were not. Jin’s trust was reliable, while Chu’s outpacing was not. Could such things truly sway his heart? Alas, his resolve was not yet pure. He sought to use Song to guard against weakness and to die for his policies rather than betray Chu. Thus, though he gained a momentary reputation, he lacked the enduring righteousness of the ages. In the end, he and his adversaries alike succumbed to exhaustion, and he could not escape the affliction of reckless passion.

When Jin’s Xun Hao led troops to besiege Gu, some of Gu’s people requested to surrender the city in rebellion. Muzi refused. His aides said: “Our troops will not be wearied, and we can take the city—why not do so?” Muzi replied: “I have heard from Shu Xiang that if likes and dislikes are not excessive, the people will know where to turn, and no affair will fail. If someone rebels with our city, it is what I deeply detest. If someone offers a city to us, what do I particularly favor? To reward what I deeply detest—how then can I reward what I favor? If I do not reward them, it is a breach of trust. How can I protect the people? If we have the strength, we advance; if not, we retreat. We act according to our capacity. I cannot covet a city and thus draw near to treachery—what we would lose would be far greater.” He had the people of Gu execute the rebels and repair their defenses. After besieging Gu for three months, some of its people requested to surrender. He had their people appear before him. Seeing they still had food and color, he temporarily repaired their city. His officers said: “We have taken the city but do not seize it, wearying the people and exhausting the troops—how will this serve our lord?”

Muzi said: "In serving one’s lord, if seizing a single city teaches the people to grow lax, what use is the city? A city is meant to purchase respite—better to preserve what we already have. Leading with unerring righteousness, the city may be taken, and the people will know where righteousness lies. They will hold fast to their lives without divided hearts—is this not acceptable?"

When the people of Gu reported their food exhausted and strength spent, he conquered Gu and returned without executing a single person.

The record states: *The Spring and Autumn Annals* declares there are no righteous wars, yet was not the siege of Gu such a case? Those who act with righteousness inspire awe for righteousness in others; those who act with trustworthiness inspire awe for trustworthiness. But when one feigns a meeting with the Qi forces—where is trustworthiness in that? When one borrows passage through Xian Yu—where is righteousness? The destruction of Fei was severe indeed. Could such a course be repeated?

To indulge the lord’s faults and then condemn others for rebellion; to delight in others’ fine words yet willingly embrace barbarism—these are things the noble person does not accept.

*The Records of the Historian* states: Sun Wuzi presented his *Art of War* to King Helü of Wu. The king said: "I have read all thirteen of your chapters. May I test your methods on a small scale with troops?" Sunzi replied: "You may." Thereupon, the king brought forth palace beauties, one hundred eighty in number. Sunzi divided them into two companies, appointing three of the king’s favorite concubines as captains, each holding a halberd. He instructed them: "Do you know your heart, your left and right hands, and your back?" The women replied: "We do." Sunzi said: "When I say 'forward,' look toward your heart; 'left,' toward your left hand; 'right,' toward your right hand; 'turn,' toward your back." The women assented. After the commands were issued, axes were set up, and the orders were repeated three times and reinforced five times.

Then he sounded the drum, and the women on the right burst into laughter. Sunzi said: "When commands are unclear and orders not thoroughly drilled, the fault lies with the commander." Again he repeated the commands three times and reinforced them five times before sounding the drum once more. The women on the left then laughed aloud. Sunzi declared: "Though the commands are now clear, those who fail to follow them bear the fault of officers and troops." Thereupon he ordered the execution of the two company captains. From his terrace, the king of Wu witnessed this and, alarmed at the prospect of losing his beloved concubines, hastily sent a messenger to command: "I now see that the general is truly skilled in warfare. Without these two ladies, my meals would lose their savor—I beg you spare them." Sunzi replied: "Having received my commission as commander, I must obey military law even if it means disregarding the ruler’s orders." He then beheaded the two captains and displayed their heads, appointing their seconds in command. When the drum sounded again, the women moved left and right, forward and back, kneeling and rising—all in perfect accord with the rules, without a single sound. Sunzi sent word to the king: "The troops are now well-ordered. Your Majesty may descend to inspect them. They will obey any command, even to march through fire or water." The king said: "Let the general rest in his quarters. I do not wish to descend and observe." Sunzi replied: "Your Majesty merely delights in fine words but cannot put them into practice."

Thereafter, King Helü recognized Sunzi’s military prowess and ultimately appointed him as his general. To the west, he crushed the mighty state of Chu and entered Ying; to the north, he overawed Qi and Jin, winning renown among the feudal lords—Sunzi’s contribution was decisive.

**Record:** This act of Sunzi’s surpassed even that of Shang Yang or Wu Qi. For while commands must be enforceable, the people must not be coerced; concubines may be executed, but wives must not be killed. The opening of Sunzi’s *Thirteen Chapters* states: "Wisdom, trustworthiness, benevolence, courage, and strictness." Though the king had read it all, why did he not reflect: "When the ruler issues orders, the minister obeys"? To delight in words yet fail to apply them is unwise. To let favoritism disrupt military discipline is cowardly. To treat palace women as playthings is to lack strictness. Trust is the greatest treasure of a ruler—if even a small test is mishandled, how much more so in great matters? One who acts thus cannot be called trustworthy.

Some may say: "Etiquette does not deign to mention the ruler’s carriage horses." Yet favored concubines are not the same as carriage horses—how could their defiance and arbitrary execution reflect a benevolent heart? Mencius said: "With benevolence comes honor; without it, disgrace." Sunzi was not inherently cruel, but he detested those who laughed in defiance of the law, just as one detests those who force wine upon the drunk. In the end, he broke Chu and entered Ying, overawed Qi and subdued Jin, winning renown among the feudal lords. Though he may not have prized virtue, did he not honor the worth of his officers?

*Hongdao Record*, Volume 46: "Wisdom" begins.

**On the Wisdom of Friends**

From the *Analects*: The Master said to Zigong, “Between you and Yan Hui, who is the superior?” Zigong replied, “How dare I compare myself to Hui? Hui hears one thing and understands ten; I hear one thing and understand two.” The Master said, “You are not his equal. Neither you nor I are his equal.”

*Recorded*: At the gate of the sage, instruction is generally not given unless one is struggling, nor is enlightenment offered unless one is hesitating. Comparing others is not inherently blameworthy, but if I do not desire something, yet others impose it upon me, I take it upon myself to broadly bestow it upon the people and aid the multitude—this is benevolence. Compared to Yanzi, the difference is as vast as heaven and earth. Yet if one possesses a keen and sharp nature, though not yet truly able to draw near analogies, one should not take Zigong’s words of self-deprecation as entirely trustworthy. Thus, the Master prompted him with the question of who was superior. And Zigong, in truth, was able to reflect inwardly and advance himself, engaging in the ceaseless pursuit of learning—gazing upward, drilling downward, ever striving, unable to desist. What manner of man was Yan Hui? To aspire to him is to look back; in terms of his innate endowments and the heights he attained, if one merely reaches that level, it is enough. Among Confucius’s disciples, why would one need a wise man to recognize Yan Hui? Thus, the Son of Heaven twice declared, “You are not his equal.” If this were the end of Zigong’s story, it would suffice.

The Master said: “Yan Hui’s character was such that he chose the Mean, and having grasped one good, he held it fast in his heart and never lost it.”

*Recorded*: This is the foundation of hearing one and knowing ten. If there is nothing he does not choose, then there is nothing he does not attain or fall short of. If there is nothing he does not grasp, then there is nothing he does not hold fast to or lose. Accumulating this, one reaches a state where there is nothing left to choose and nothing unattained. Thus, hearing one and knowing ten arises spontaneously. Scholars who have not yet reached this level need only avoid failing in the task of choosing the good and holding it fast—then they may attain Yan Hui’s station.

The Master said: “Yan Hui was nearly perfect, yet he was often in want. Zigong did not accept his fate and engaged in trade, and his conjectures were frequently correct.”

*Recorded*: Confucius once spoke of Yan Hui and Zigong together, for their natures were similar, though their practices diverged. Yan Hui’s nearness to the Dao lay in his ability to choose, finding joy in all things—not merely due to his natural endowments, but because of the depth of his learning. Zigong did not accept his fate and could not choose, yet his conjectures were often correct, a result of his natural alignment rather than the utmost clarity of his understanding. This “fate” does not refer to wealth, poverty, honor, or lowliness, but to the mandate of Heaven that is called nature. His frequent want and his trading were but incidental matters.

The Master said: “Zigong, do you take me to be one who learns extensively and retains it all?” Zigong replied, “Yes—is it not so?” The Master said, “No. I have one thread that runs through it all.”

*Recorded*: This moment of belief followed by sudden doubt arose not from the depth of his accumulated learning, but from his imprecision in choosing. Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Kings Wen and Wu, the Duke of Zhou, Confucius, and Yan Hui all followed the same Dao, threading it through all things. Thus, rites, music, culture, and the events of past and present can be learned extensively and retained, but the essence of utmost precision, singularity, and holding fast to the Mean cannot be grasped through extensive learning alone. Had he chosen carefully from the outset, this doubt would not have arisen. The Master’s teaching of the “one thread” to Zigong was the same as to Zengzi, but he prefaced it with “extensive learning,” differing from his approach with Zengzi. For Zengzi focused on preserving simplicity, while Zigong sought broad application. Simplicity requires no explanation to be understood; breadth leads to belief followed by doubt.

The Master said: “Shen, my Dao is threaded through with one.” Zengzi replied, “Yes.” When the Master left, the disciples asked, “What did he mean?” Zengzi said, “The Master’s Dao is nothing more than loyalty and forbearance.”

*Recorded*: In my humble view, Zigong’s wisdom was such that he dared not compare himself to Yan Hui, nor could he dare compare himself to Zengzi. Yan Hui held fast to one good and thus effortlessly understood ten. Zengzi strove for loyalty and forbearance and thus clearly grasped the one thread. Zengzi did not borrow from scholars to clarify the Dao; he grounded it in his heart without fear, applied it to himself with certainty, and expressed it in words without confusion. Loyalty and forbearance are not two paths, just as the one and the thread are not two things. Yet how does one unify the one and thread it through the myriad things? How does one attain this? Here, the diligent scholar finds ample ground for effort. One can strive to exhaust oneself and extend to others, but unity cannot be forced, nor can threading be contrived. Yet when one reaches the ultimate state, self and others merge into one path, Heaven and humanity unite in one Dao. Without seeking unity, unity is found in the heart; without seeking to thread, threading is found in all things. This is not only to learn well from the Master but also to teach disciples well; not only to teach disciples well but also to instruct all generations. If one merely pursues the lofty and distant without knowing the method, even a thousand words would be insufficient—how could one word suffice?

From the *Zuozhuan*: When Wu Zixia visited Lu, he requested to hear the music of Zhou. The musicians sang for him the *Zhounan* and *Shaonan*. He said, “How fine! The foundation of the state is laid, yet it is not yet complete. Still, the people labor without resentment.” They sang the *Bei*, *Yong*, and *Wei*. He said, “How profound! Though troubled, they are not overwhelmed. I have heard that the virtue of Duke Kang and Duke Wu of Wei was like this—this must be the *Wei Feng*.” They sang the *Wang*. He said, “How fine! Though pensive, they are not fearful—this must be the Zhou of the east.” They sang the *Zheng*. He said, “How fine! Yet it is too refined; the people cannot bear it. Will this not be the first to perish?” They sang the *Qi*. He said, “How magnificent! Vast and mighty, like a great wind.”

When they sang of the lands east of the Huai, he said, “This must be the realm of the Grand Duke—its future cannot yet be measured.” They sang the *Bin*. He said, “How fine! So expansive—joyous yet not excessive. This must be the eastern legacy of the Duke of Zhou.” They sang the *Qin*. He said, “This is what is called the Xia sound. To embody the Xia is to be great, for its influence reaches far. This must be the old domain of Zhou.” They sang the *Wei*. He said, “How fine! So stirring—grand yet gentle, pure yet yielding. To govern with virtue as aid—this is the mark of an enlightened ruler.” They sang the *Tang*. He said, “How profound! Could these be the remnant people of the Lord of Tao-Tang? If not, why would their sorrow run so deep? Only the descendants of noble virtue could be thus.” They sang the *Chen*. He said, “A state without a master—how can it endure?” From *Bin* onward, he offered no further critique.

When they sang the *Lesser Odes*, he said, “How fine! Thoughtful yet unwavering, resentful yet unspoken. This must mark the decline of Zhou’s virtue, though the people of the former kings yet remain.” When they sang the *Greater Odes*, he said, “How vast! So radiant—bent yet upright in form. This must be the virtue of King Wen.” When they sang the *Hymns*, he said, “Perfect indeed! Upright yet not haughty, yielding yet not submissive, near yet not cloying, distant yet not estranged, adaptable yet not excessive, returning yet not wearying, reversing yet not distressed, joyful yet not dissolute, enduring yet not exhausted, expansive yet not ostentatious, bestowing yet not wasteful, taking yet not greedy, abiding yet not stagnant, flowing yet not drifting. The five notes harmonize, the eight winds align, rhythm has measure, order is preserved—such is the shared mark of supreme virtue.”

When he saw the dance of *Xiang Yin* and *Nan Lü*, he said, “How fine! Yet there is still regret.” When he saw the dance of *Da Wu*, he said, “How fine! This must be the height of Zhou’s glory.” When he saw the dance of *Shao Hu*, he said, “The greatness of the sage! Yet even here, there is a fleeting flaw—how difficult it is to be a sage.” When he saw the dance of *Da Xia*, he said, “How fine! Diligent yet not self-congratulatory—who but Yu could have perfected this?” When he saw the dance of *Shao Yin*, he said, “Virtue has reached its utmost! Vast indeed—like heaven, which covers all without exception, like earth, which bears all without limit. Even the most exalted virtue cannot surpass this.”

The record states: *The Great Plan* says, “Thought is called wisdom.” Master Zhou said, “Non-thought is the root; thought is the means of connection. Without thought, there can be no connection. Without subtle wisdom, there can be no all-encompassing connection.” When Ji Zixia abandoned his home to till the land, his nurtured nature was already settled, and the spirit of Tai Bo in heaven subtly worked to connect his hidden depths. Thus, before he heard the music, it was as if the valley’s echo had not yet changed, the reeds had not yet stirred, rare sounds were scarce, and true connoisseurs were few. But after he heard the music, it was as if the nine heavens had opened, the hundred rivers had arrived in season, veins and channels had become clear, and all was suddenly and thoroughly connected. He understood its rising and fading, its beauty and grandeur, its diligence and sorrow, its vastness and refinement, its depth and breadth, its foundation and culmination—until it reached the point of being like heaven’s covering and earth’s bearing, and only then did it cease.

Was it that he sang every line or parsed every word? Rather, the all-encompassing connection arises from connecting the subtle, and connecting the subtle arises from thought. Did not the Master say, “I never expected music to reach such heights”? In his daily recitations and longings, his admiration and delight were as urgent as one drawing water from a well. Yet once he heard it, there was an ineffable melting of the heart and a profound sigh. Alas!

Today, those who recite the *Three Hundred Poems* are not even equal to a single phrase sung by a musician—this is because they do not think and thus cannot connect. Though the Master’s sighs were many, what use are they? And though one may observe, what use is that?

Jizha, while in Lu, met Shusun Muzi and spoke with him, saying to Muzi: "You will not die a natural death, for you love goodness yet cannot choose men wisely. I have heard that the noble man’s duty lies in selecting the right people. You, as the chief minister of Lu, hold its great governance, yet you do not exercise caution in appointments—how can you bear this? Disaster will surely befall you." He then journeyed to Qi, where he spoke with Yan Pingzhong, saying: "You hold both fief and office. Without fief, without office, you would have escaped calamity. Qi’s governance will soon pass to another; until it finds its rightful steward, strife will not cease." Thus, Yanzi, through Chen Huanzi, returned his fief and office, thereby evading the disaster of Le Gao.

He then visited Zheng, where he met Zitu, treating him as an old acquaintance. They shared a white mat, and Zichan presented him with a patterned robe. Jizha said: "Zheng’s ruling ministers are extravagant, and disaster is near. Governance will soon fall to you—rule with care, through ritual. Otherwise, Zheng will fall." Proceeding to Wei, he spoke with Lian Huan, Shi Gou, Shi Qi, Prince Ke, Gongshu Fa, and Prince Chao, saying: "Wei abounds in noble men; it has no cause for concern."

From Wei, he traveled to Jin, intending to rest at Qi. Hearing the sound of bells, he remarked: "How strange! I have heard that one who is discerning yet lacking in virtue will surely meet with execution." He then departed. When Wenzi learned of this, he never again listened to the zither or lute.

In Jin, he spoke with Yuefuzi, Han Xuanzi, and Wei Xianzi, saying: "Jin’s governance will likely gather in the hands of these three families." He then spoke with Shu Xiang, and as he prepared to leave, he said: "Exert yourself. The lord is extravagant and surrounded by many worthy men, while the ministers are all wealthy—governance will soon lie with the great families. You value uprightness; you must think how to preserve yourself from disaster."

The record states: The so-called learned and refined noble man does not merely understand past events but also foresees what is to come. Through stillness, emptiness, and clarity, clarity leads to comprehension of movement; uprightness leads to impartiality, and impartiality to universality. All these arise from the absence of desire. Looking at the present, men like Yan Ying of Qi, Zichan of Zheng, Boyu of Wei, and Shu Xiang of Jin were all extraordinary figures of their age. And men like Bao, Wu, Qi, Shu, Shan, Jing, and Chao were all prominent in governance. Though Wu was distant from the Central States, Jizha was close to benevolence and worthiness—was he not one who befriended the good throughout the world? Had he confined his renown to a single state or indulged in the riches and honors of his time, failing to befriend the wise and worthy, how could his illustrious name have endured to this day?

Yet even one as sagely as the Master once heard his voice and cough, and when Yan You was in Lu, he never once sent Jizha so much as a messenger—thus he remained but a man of a single state.

*Comprehensive Mirror*: Tian Dan was about to attack Di when he went to see Lu Zhonglian. Zhonglian said: "General, you will not take Di." Tian Dan replied: "I, with the remnants of Jimo’s broken troops, defeated the ten-thousand-chariot state of Yan and restored Qi’s ruins. Now you say I cannot take Di—why?" He mounted his chariot without a word of thanks and departed. He then attacked Di but failed to capture it after three months. Alarmed, he returned to see Lu Zhonglian and said: "Sir, you said I could not take Di—pray, let me hear your reasoning." Zhonglian replied: "When you were in Jimo, you sat on a basket of earth and stood with a spade in hand, rallying your soldiers with these words: ‘There is nowhere left to go—our ancestral temples are lost! Now, what hope remains? Where shall we turn?’ At that time, you had the resolve to die, and your soldiers had no thought of living. When you spoke, none failed to weep and raise their arms, eager to fight. That is how you defeated Yan. Now, you enjoy the revenues of Yeyi to the east and the pleasures of Zishang to the west, girded with gold, galloping between Zi and Mian. You know the joys of life but have no thought of death—this is why you cannot prevail." Tian Dan said: "I have taken your words to heart."

The next day, he roused his qi and patrolled the city walls, standing where arrows and stones rained down, seizing the drum and beating it himself. Thereupon, the Di people withdrew.

Lu writes: How perspicacious, this Lu Zhonglian! How keenly he struck the heart of the matter. Even with a man of Yue Yi’s worth, why did he falter at Ju and Jimo? Was it not for lack of such resolve? Thus the sages and worthies of old, ever vigilant and ever striving, kept Heaven’s principles ever in mind and dared not entertain thoughts of death. They feared only that the enemy’s resolve might harden while their own defenses slackened—was this not the reason?

When Tian Dan conquered Liaocheng, he spoke of Lu Zhonglian to the King of Qi. The king wished to ennoble him, but Zhonglian fled to the sea, saying: “I would rather embrace poverty and low station, free to follow my will, than accept wealth and rank and [lacuna].”
Lu writes: Lu Lian’s indulgence of his will—was it not excessive? Such indulgence is not what the worthy desire. When ruler acts as ruler, minister as minister, father as father, son as son, and when husband and wife, elder and younger, friends all fulfill their proper roles, how can the world be treated lightly? How can the will be left unchecked? Yet in Zhonglian’s time, the feudal lords sought to make Qin emperor, abandoning the righteousness between lord and minister; Yan’s king ceded his state, forsaking the benevolence between father and son; Queen Junwang remarried, defiling the rites between husband and wife; King Huiwen enthroned his younger son, disrupting the order between elder and younger; and the likes of Sun Bin, Pang Juan, Su Qin, and Zhang Yi sowed discord among friends, betraying the trust between them. Was it not for these reasons that Zhonglian sought to cast himself into the Eastern Sea? Even before the world’s scholars had spoken, men of middling ability could see that such a course was untenable.

Zishun was a sixth-generation descendant of Confucius. When the King of Wei heard of his worth, he sent an envoy bearing gold and silks to summon him. Zishun said: “If the king can truly put my Way into practice, then my Way is indeed for governing the world. Though I eat coarse food and drink plain water, I will serve him. But if he merely wishes to bind me to his service with high rank and generous emolument, then I am but one man—what need has the King of Wei for one man?” The envoy pressed him, and Zishun went to Wei. For nine months, he laid out his grand designs, but they were never adopted. He then retired, pleading illness. His friends said to him: “You should leave.” He replied: “Where would I go? Now, the states east of the mountains are exhausted and cannot recover. The Three Jin have ceded land to seek peace. The Two Zhous have collapsed and fallen to Qin. Yan, Qi, and Chu have already submitted. Judging from this, within twenty years, the world will surely belong entirely to Qin.”
Lu writes: In observing Zishun’s plans and wisdom, how different he was from others! When the state has the Way, one serves; when it does not, one folds one’s wings and keeps them close—this was the family tradition of Confucius. Qin’s cruelty is like a raging fire, and the world is but tinder. It cannot be extinguished or contained—how then can one wash oneself of it and flee? The rulers of the six states are like sparrows nesting in a hall—how can they remain even for a moment? How can they hope for lasting peace? His prediction that the world would belong to Qin within twenty years was not mere calculation, but principle. None but Zishun could have spoken thus.

The King of Qi enfeoffed Tian Ying at Xue, styling him Lord Jingguo. Lord Jingguo wished to fortify Xue. A retainer said to him: “Have you not heard of the great fish of the Eastern Sea? Nets cannot haul it, hooks cannot pull it, but when it strays from the water, even ants and frogs can overpower it. Now, Qi is your water. If you can long possess Qi, what need have you of Xue? But if you lose Qi, though you raise Xue’s walls to the heavens, will they suffice to rely upon?” Thereupon, he did not fortify Xue.
Lu writes: This retainer’s remonstrance with Ying was far wiser than the schemes of those like Wu and Lian Wen. What place have the likes of hawks, owls, and thieves in the records? Who could recall a retainer like this? Yet history has lost even his name. Later generations, such as Meiwu and Jin Hao, are not only a disgrace to gentlemen—if this retainer had any awareness, would he not grind his teeth in the underworld?

From the *Book of Han*: In his humble days, Cao Shen was on close terms with Xiao He, but later, as generals and ministers, they fell into discord. Upon hearing of Xiao He’s death, Cao Shen instructed his attendants to prepare for his journey, saying, “I shall enter the capital to become chancellor.” Soon after, an imperial envoy indeed arrived. Before his death, Xiao He had recommended only Cao Shen as worthy. When Cao Shen succeeded him as chancellor, he altered nothing, strictly adhering to Xiao He’s regulations. He selected officials from the commanderies and kingdoms who were inarticulate in rhetoric but steadfast and venerable, appointing them as his aides. Those clerks who were eloquent and harsh, seeking fame, he promptly dismissed. If he saw someone commit a minor fault, he would deliberately conceal and cover it up, so that the chancellery remained untroubled.

The Emperor, puzzled that the chancellor did not attend to affairs of state, asked, “Does Your Majesty consider himself as sagely and martial as the late Emperor?” The Emperor replied, “How dare I compare myself to the former Emperor?” Cao Shen then asked, “Does Your Majesty consider me as worthy as Xiao He?” The Emperor said, “It seems you do not measure up.” Cao Shen replied, “Your Majesty speaks truly. The late Emperor and Xiao He established the laws and decrees of the realm with utmost clarity. Now, if Your Majesty governs with ease while we ministers uphold our duties, adhering to these statutes without fail, would that not suffice?” The Emperor said, “Well said.”

After serving as chancellor for three years, the people sang of him: *“Xiao He made the laws, clear as day and night; Cao Shen succeeded him, guarding them without fail. His purity and constancy brought the people peace and unity.”*

Lu writes: Observing the relations among the meritorious ministers of Han, I see that their wisdom—or lack thereof—determined whether fortune or misfortune befell them. Comparing Xiao He and Cao Shen to Han Xin and Peng Yue is like comparing Han Xin and Peng Yue to Zhou Bo and Guan Ying. The histories praise Chancellor Cao for his achievements in storming cities and battling in the wilds, attributing his many victories to his association with the Marquis of Huaiyin. It is also recorded that after Han Xin had conquered Zhao and become chancellor, Cao Shen served as his right-hand minister, assisting in the conquest of Qi and the subjugation of the Lixia army. Later, he followed Han Xin to strike Long Ju, encamping at Gaomi. Cao Shen had risen alongside the Emperor from Feng and Pei, sharing such deep bonds, and both had served as chancellors, enjoying equal esteem. Yet when Han Xin gave orders, Cao Shen obeyed; when Han Xin led, Cao Shen followed—never once harboring the slightest resentment. Han Xin, once stripped of his kingship, grew despondent and discontented, even ashamed to be ranked alongside Zhou Bo and Guan Ying. Thus, Cao Shen’s heart was not merely set on maintaining peace and uniformity once the realm was settled. Even amid the clamor of war, he neither overreached nor sought gain, so that Xiao He’s legacy remained unmarred.

It is further said: Had Cao Shen still been alive, could the Lü clan have usurped the throne, and could the House of Liu have avoided peril? The answer: Huangshi Gong’s maxim states, *“A plot leaked in secret brings ruin.”* At that time, Emperor Hui was weak and ineffectual, while the Lü clan was swift and cunning. Yin waxed as yang waned—a case of *“the marsh drowning the wood,”* as the *Book of Changes* warns. Had Cao Shen failed to heed the omen of a sagging ridgepole and instead rushed headlong into peril, could he have succeeded? Yet it was not that he was unaware of the dangers of indulgence or the troubles of the realm. Between failure through exposure and success through retreat, which was the wiser choice? Later, when Ju Shou’s words spurred the downfall of the Lü clan, it was Cao Shen’s foresight that made it possible. Yet the historians Ban and Ma recorded Cao Shen while omitting Ju Shou—was this not an oversight?

During Empress Lü’s reign, the Lü clan monopolized power, scheming to coerce the young emperor and endanger the House of Liu. Chancellor Chen Ping, though troubled, lacked the strength to resist and often sat in deep contemplation. Lu Jia visited him unannounced and entered without ceremony, saying, “Why do you ponder so deeply?” Chen Ping replied, “What do you suppose I am pondering?” Lu Jia said, “Your Excellency holds the highest office and enjoys the revenue of ten thousand households—one could say you have attained the utmost wealth and honor without further desires. Yet your worries can only concern the Lü clan and the young emperor.” Chen Ping said, “Indeed.”

"What is to be done?" Chen Ping asked.

Lu Jia replied, "When the realm is at peace, attention turns to the chancellor; when the realm is in peril, attention turns to the general. If general and chancellor are in harmony, then the officers will be content and loyal. With officers content and loyal, even if the realm undergoes upheaval, power will not be divided. When power is not divided, the fate of the altars of state rests in the hands of you two alone. Why not befriend the Grand Marshal and bind him to you in deep alliance?"

Chen Ping followed his advice, presenting the Grand Marshal with five hundred gold pieces as a birthday gift and hosting him with lavish feasts and music. The Grand Marshal reciprocated in kind. The two forged a deep alliance, and the Lü clan’s schemes grew ever more precarious.

*Recorded Note:* Chen Ping devised six extraordinary strategies, priding himself on his own wisdom, yet he still deferred to Lu Jia—why? At that time, fearing disaster would befall him, he was too entangled in the crisis to see clearly, and thus fell short of the clarity of one observing from the side. Yet this view is but one interpretation. A scholar of the Southern Song later countered: "Since ancient times, no general has ever achieved great deeds abroad while a powerful minister held sway at court." Their understanding was much the same—who would have thought these two scholars, separated by time, would follow the same line of reasoning? Yet their intent was as different as yin and yang, day and night, warmth and cold—utterly irreconcilable. Thus their outcomes diverged in peace and peril, advantage and dullness, fortune and misfortune, survival and ruin. Those who govern the realm must take heed of this principle.

Zhu Yi, ranked first in administrative conduct, was appointed Grand Minister of Agriculture. He was sincere and generous, deeply loyal to old friends, yet his nature was upright and incorruptible, refusing to engage in private dealings. The Son of Heaven held him in high esteem, and the court respected him.

At the time, Zhang Chang served as Chancellor of Jiaodong. He wrote to Zhu Yi, saying: "The enlightened ruler turns his mind to the distant past, broadly seeking worthy scholars—this is truly the time for loyal ministers to exhaust their thoughts. Yet I, Zhang Chang, am exiled to govern a troubled commandery, constrained by regulations and ink, my heart bound and knotted, leaving no room for extraordinary ideas. Even if I had them, where could they be applied? You, sir, possess a virtue of clarity and integrity, overseeing the affairs of the grain and fields. In the past, though Chen Ping was wise, he needed Wei Qing to advance; though Han Xin was brilliant, he relied on Lord Xiao to gain trust. Thus, each case reveals the heroes of its time. If one insists on recommending only those of Yi Yin or Lü Wang’s caliber, then such men would never have risen through your aid."

Moved by Zhang Chang’s words, Zhu Yi recommended many worthy scholars and officials, and many benefited from his support.

*Recorded Note:* According to the *Rites of Zhou: Grand Minister of Education*, "With the three virtues of the village, teach the myriad people and summon the worthy"—this is the duty of the Grand Minister of Agriculture. Zhang Chang’s counsel to Zhu Yi may be called discerning of urgent priorities, neither failing to recognize talent nor indulging in grand words. Thus it is recorded.

Yú Bǎo, by virtue of his mastery of the classics, served as a clerk in the commandery. The Censor-in-Chief, Zhāng Zhōng, summoned him as an aide and wished him to instruct his son in the classics. He had a residence prepared and provisions arranged for him, but Yú Bǎo submitted a memorial to resign and left. Zhāng Zhōng repeatedly urged him to return, though inwardly he felt displeased. Later, when Yú Bǎo was appointed as chief clerk, he moved into the official residence and performed the house-warming sacrifice. Zhāng Zhōng, secretly observing this with suspicion, sent a close associate to inquire: *"Previously, the Censor-in-Chief had a grand residence prepared for you, yet you resigned in protest, seeking to display lofty integrity. Now, the chief clerks of both offices are men of refined conduct, yet you have accepted the post. Though you delight in the new residence, your actions before and after seem inconsistent."*

Yú Bǎo replied: *"That refined scholars do not serve as chief clerks is their own choice, but the Censor-in-Chief deemed me worthy of the post—none in the entire office objected, so how could I alone claim superiority? Earlier, your son wished to study the classics, and you sought to bring me closer to him. The rites prescribe that students come to the teacher, not that the teacher go to them. The Dao cannot be compromised, but what harm is there in personally demonstrating this? Moreover, if one has not encountered the right opportunity, there is nothing one cannot do—how could I refuse the post of chief clerk?"*

Yú Zhōng, having heard this, promptly memorialized the throne, praising Yú Bǎo for his mastery of the classics and his upright character, recommending him for appointment as a close attendant. Thereupon, Bǎo was made *Yìláng* and later promoted to *Jiàn Dàfū*.

The compiler notes: At the time, Bǎo was still a minor official, yet his lifelong wisdom was first set down in these words. Why? The threat of wolves and jackals is long known, yet the warning against the fox in the city walls must not be neglected—this refers to his refusal to implicate Dù Yǔ in the affair of Jì. The roots of calamity run deep, yet the grievance of the fierce beast must not be erased—this refers to his memorial of a few lines that rescued Zhèng Chóng from prison. In the end, he preserved himself and even secured his descendants. Was he not a man of keen insight?

*Hong Dao Lu*, Scroll 46, ends.

*Hong Dao Lu*, Scroll 47: Wisdom
**Wisdom Among Friends**

From *The Book of the Later Han*: Zhōng Hào was renowned for his steadfast conduct, and along with Xún Sù, he was admired and sought after by scholar-officials. Lǐ Yīng once sighed, saying, *"Master Xún’s discernment is peerless, while Master Zhōng’s perfect virtue is worthy of emulation."* A fellow townsman, Chén Huáng, was younger than Hào, yet Hào drew him close as a friend.

When Hào served as *Gōngcáo* of the commandery and was summoned to the Minister of Justice’s office, the governor, upon his departure, asked, *"Who can take your place?"* Hào replied, *"If Your Excellency truly seeks the right man, the warden of Xīmén, Chén Huáng, will do."* Upon hearing this, Huáng said, *"Master Zhōng seems not to judge others well—how did he recognize me alone?"*

Hào’s nephew, Jǐn, was also fond of learning and admired antiquity, embodying a spirit of modesty and deference. He was the same age as Yīng and equally renowned. Yīng’s grandfather, the Grand Commandant Xiū, remarked, *"Jǐn resembles our family’s nature: when the state is well-ordered, he will not be cast aside; when it is not, he will escape execution."* Thus, Yīng married his sister to him.

Hào often advised, *"In the past, Guó Wǔzǐ delighted in exposing others’ faults, inviting resentment. The true Way lies in preserving oneself and one’s family."* Later, Jǐn died at home, and the scholars composed a eulogy for him:

*"Of virtuous conduct in Línlǜ,
He dwelt only where propriety allowed.
Delighting in the *Odes* and *Documents*,
He played the zither, cherishing antiquity.
Five times summoned by the provinces,
Nine times offered the highest offices,
He declined imperial commands,
Passing his years in ease."*

The compiler notes: The advice of Yīng’s grandfather seems at odds with Yīng’s own character. Why? From the middle of the Han onward, eunuchs and upstarts wielded unchecked power, and society came to exalt those who risked their lives through defiant purity and outspoken criticism. Those who did not conform were denounced even by commoners and herdsmen. Thus, the sage guides the people toward balanced reason, curbing excess and recklessness, cautioning whom they associate with, and tempering their biases. Men like Línlǜ possessed the wisdom to preserve themselves, their Dao never cutting off from others. Neither the treacherous nor the powerful could sway them with authority or arrogance. Truly, they were those who had extricated themselves from the currents of desire.

Xú Yǔ was poor and tilled the land himself, eating only what his own labor produced. Yet he was reverent, frugal, dutiful, and yielding, and all who dwelt near him admired his virtue.

When Governor Chén Fān served in his commandery, he would receive no guests—save for Chēng alone, for whom he would set out a special couch, which he would hang up once Chēng departed. In the second year of the Yánxī era, Chén memorialized Emperor Huán to recommend Chēng, and the court dispatched an honored carriage with black curtains and full ceremonial protocol to summon him, yet he did not come. He had also been repeatedly recruited by Grand Commandant Huáng Qióng, but declined each time. When Huáng later died, Chēng walked on foot all the way to Jiāngxià to attend the funeral. There, he set out a simple offering of wine and a single dish, wept, and departed without leaving his name. Those gathered were all renowned scholars from the four quarters; when Guō Líntōng and several dozen others heard of it, they suspected it was Chēng. They sent Máo Róng, who rode swiftly to intercept him on the road and prepare a meal. As they spoke of farming and husbandry, Chēng, upon leaving, said to Róng: “Convey my regards to Guō Líntōng. When a great tree is about to fall, no single rope can hold it. Why cling so stubbornly, refusing to seek peace in quietude?”

The record states: The *Yìjīng*’s *Zhú* hexagram, top yang line, reads: *“Abundant pursuit brings no disadvantage.”* The commentary explains: *“Abundant” means broad, at ease, and self-content in one’s disposition. “Pursuit” means to drift far away, unbound and unentangled—this is what is good.* The top yang line, firm and radiant, stands at the hexagram’s outer edge, free from entanglements below, and thus dwells in ease. Where could it go that would not be advantageous? These words were written for Chēng. As for those others, though they knew to scorn the world with aloof disdain and refuse minor appointments, they could not drift far away—entering neither the deepest mountains nor the densest forests. Instead, they brought factional disaster upon themselves, willingly enduring execution and humiliation. These are what the *Yìjīng* calls *“pursuit with entanglements, illness, and peril.”* Could such a path truly be called wisdom?

Guō Tài was broadly learned in the classics, skilled in discourse, and possessed a refined voice and bearing. When he first met the Prefect of Hénán, Lǐ Yīng, the latter was deeply impressed and befriended him. Soon, his name resounded throughout the capital. Later, when he returned to his hometown, scholars saw him off at the riverbank in a procession of thousands of carriages.

Lin Zōng crossed the river in the same boat as Lǐ Yǐng, and the assembled guests gazed upon them as if they were immortals. Some urged him to enter officialdom, but he replied: “By night I observe the celestial signs, by day I examine human affairs—what Heaven has cast aside cannot be propped up.” Naturally perceptive of others, he delighted in encouraging and instructing scholars. Standing eight feet tall, with a commanding presence, he wore flowing robes and a broad sash, traveling through commanderies and states. Once, while journeying between Chén and Liáng, he was caught in the rain, and one corner of his headscarf drooped. Thereafter, people deliberately folded one corner of their headscarves in imitation of *Línzōng’s scarf*, so great was his renown.

Someone asked Fàn Pāng of Rǔnán: “What sort of man is Guō Línzōng?” Pāng replied: “He withdraws without defying his kin, remains true without cutting himself off from the world. The Son of Heaven cannot make him a minister, nor can the feudal lords claim him as a friend. I know nothing beyond this.” Though skilled in discerning human character, he avoided provocative or abstruse discourse, so that even when the eunuchs monopolized power, they could not harm him. When the partisan affair erupted, many renowned scholars suffered for it—only Línzōng and Yuán of Rǔnán escaped unscathed.

**Recorded Note:** Fàn Yè remarked: Zhuāng Zhōu once said that human nature is more treacherous than mountains and rivers, for though its movements may be discerned, its depths and obstructions are hard to fathom. Thus, even the closest bonds can deceive in appearance, and even a sage’s judgment is challenged by this. Yet Línzōng never erred in matters of refinement or vulgarity—his clarity of nature was truly exceptional. Nevertheless, by tempering his words and conduct, he ultimately thrived in an age of obscurity. Through humble guidance, he inspired scholars to pursue fame, a legacy even the followers of Mò and Mèng could not surpass.

Mèng Mǐn, a guest in Tàiyuán, dropped his bowl of rice to the ground, paid it no heed, and walked away. When Línzōng saw this and asked his reason, he replied: “The rice is already broken—what use is there in looking?” Struck by this, Línzōng urged him to study, and after ten years, Mǐn became renowned.

**Recorded Note:** In my humble view, Mèng Mǐn possessed innate excellence but lacked learning. Because of his innate excellence, he was free from regretful attachments and could order his affairs with precision. Because he lacked learning, he suffered unforeseen setbacks and held divergent opinions. Had he been encouraged to study, he would have become a man of true cultivation. This is how the noble person brings out the best in others, and why guidance and encouragement are indispensable.

Shēntú Pán was endowed with subtle and wondrous *qi*, his nature keen and his mind penetrating. He observed mourning rites for his parents with such devotion that he nearly perished from grief. His conduct was virtuous, his principles noble—few could match him. Content in poverty, he delighted in seclusion, savoring the Dao and upholding authenticity. Neither prosperity nor adversity swayed him, neither praise nor blame altered his resolve. Cài Yōng compared himself to Pán, acknowledging that though he was older in years, Pán surpassed him in virtue and wisdom. Later, when the commandery summoned him to serve as a clerk, he declined and remained in reclusion, mastering the Five Classics and delving into apocryphal texts.

When Línzōng met him, he marveled at his exceptional qualities. Earlier, Fàn Pāng and others had openly criticized the court, and from the highest ministers to the lowest officials, all deferred to them. Students at the Imperial Academy vied to emulate their example, believing that literature would flourish and recluses would once again be employed. Pán alone sighed and said: “In the age of the Warring States, recluses debated recklessly, and the kings of the various states even cleared the way for them as escorts—yet in the end, they suffered the calamity of the burning of books and the burying of scholars. We are witnessing the same thing now.” He then severed all ties with the world, built a hut from trees, and lived as an ordinary man. Poor, he worked as a lacquer artisan. After two years, the partisan proscription erupted, and hundreds were killed or punished—yet Pán remained untouched by suspicion.

In the fifth year of *Zhōngpíng*, fourteen men, including Xún Shuǎng, Qiáo Xuán, Hán Róng, and Chén Jì, were summoned by the imperial carriage. Pán alone did not respond, though many urged him to go; he merely smiled and said nothing. Soon after, Shuǎng and the others were coerced by [Dǒng] Zhuó. When the imperial court relocated westward and the capital descended into chaos, many high officials fell victim to war and famine, their families scattered—only Pán preserved his lofty aspirations to the end, dying at home at the age of seventy-four.

**Recorded Note:** The histories praise Shēntú Pán for perceiving the subtlest signs—yet his insight was not merely into signs, but into the Dao itself, and his judgment was sound. For though criticizing the court led to officials deferring to them, and though the court was corrupt, they achieved personal loftiness—what manner of affair was this? As the *Zhōngyōng* says: “Everyone calls themselves wise, yet when driven into nets, traps, and pits, they do not realize it.” This is precisely what it describes.

With Pán’s endowment of qi so profound and subtle, his nature keen and his mind penetrating, he was thus able from the outset to stand resolute, free from doubt and dispute, and thereafter to remain unhurried, fulfilling his far-reaching vision—just as the *Yìjīng* says of one who “pursues excellence with steadfast virtue and meets with good fortune.” That he preserved his lofty aspirations to the end was only fitting.

Xǔ Shù in his youth was renowned for his unyielding integrity and his love of human relationships, discerning and esteeming many. Figures like Fán Zǐzhāo and Yáng Shì rose to prominence in the world, and thus whenever the realm spoke of those who elevated men of talent, they invariably praised Xǔ Shù. When he often traveled to Yǐngchuān, he associated with many elders—save that he never paid a visit to Chén Tài. Moreover, when Chén Fán returned to bury his deceased wife, all the villagers attended, yet Shù alone did not go. Someone asked him the reason, and he replied: “Tàiqiū’s Way is too broad; what is broad is hard to encompass fully. Zhòngjǔ’s nature is too severe; what is severe allows little accommodation. Thus I did not call on him.” Such was the frequency of his measured judgments.

When Cáo Cāo was still obscure, he often humbled his words and offered lavish gifts, seeking to be assessed by Shù. Shù, however, disdained the man and refused to respond. Cāo then lay in wait to coerce him, and Shù, having no choice, said: “You are a treacherous villain in times of peace, a hero in times of chaos.” Cāo departed greatly pleased. Shù and his elder cousin Jìng were both of lofty discernment, fond of discussing the characters of their village and district. Each month they would revise their evaluations, giving rise to the local custom of the “monthly critique” in Rǔnán.

**Recorded Note:** Observing Xǔ Shù’s monthly critiques and comparing them to Xì Yě’s *Spring and Autumn* judgments, how far apart they are! The Master said: “Cì, are you truly worthy? As for me, I have no leisure for such things.” The sage’s way of engaging the world and managing affairs was indeed thus. Since he had already deemed Tàiqiū too broad to encompass and Zhòngjǔ too severe to accommodate, his judgments were sound—so why did he not have the leisure to attend to them? Though Cāo was cunning and shrewd, his time had not yet come; yet in the end, even a single *yào* rib was not tolerated—how fortunate he was to escape disaster! This was no way of the wise preserving themselves.

The *Book of Jìn* records: Huángfǔ Mì was tranquil and sparing of desires, diligent and untiring in his efforts. He mastered the classics and the hundred schools’ teachings, devoting himself to writing, styling himself the Master of Mystic Repose. He composed the *Discourse on Preserving the Mystic* and the *Treatise on the Music of the Sages and the True*. Some urged him to cultivate fame and expand his connections, but Mì replied: “No one short of a sage can fully reconcile withdrawal and engagement. Dwelling among fields and villages, content in poverty and tilling the soil, one may still delight in the Way of Yáo and Shùn—why must one pursue worldly advantage, entangle oneself in official duties, and only then be deemed worthy?” He wrote the *Discourse on Preserving the Mystic*, saying: “What men most cherish is life; what the Way must fully preserve is form. What harms form and nature is illness. If one disturbs the Way of wholeness to harm life and nature, how can one escape poverty and lowliness while preserving what one desires? When one person dies, mourners deem it a loss; when one is born, laughers deem it a gain. Yet mourning and laughter are not truly gains or losses of life and death. Thus the supreme Way is not diminished, and the highest virtue is not augmented. Why? Because it is complete in itself. If one were to turn the thoughts of all under heaven toward averting the calamity of harming life, or direct the hearts of the four seas toward spreading the disease of false augmentation, would this be the perfection of the Dao and virtue? Only that which is not diminished is supremely firm; only that which is not augmented is supremely substantial. Firmness endures without diminution; substantiality endures without attenuation. If one can embody the reality of firmness and substantiality, abide in the truth of non-attenuation, stand beyond gain and loss, and wander beyond the bounds of form and body, then one’s Way is whole.” Thus he never entered official service. When Emperor Wǔ issued an edict pressing him, Mì submitted a memorial calling himself a rustic, a younger brother borrowing books. The emperor sent him a cartload of books.

**Recorded Note:** How wise was the Master of Mystic Repose! Indeed, he not only understood but lived by this principle.

Amidst poverty and low station, he could still attend to illness and affliction, evading the chaos of a disordered age. His learning arose from purity and emptiness, his aspirations rooted in ritual and law. Neither could he be likened to the vulgar crowd, nor did he regard wealth and honor as more than floating clouds—such a man was beyond comparison. The discourse of Mystic Repose penetrated the truths of life and death, offering much worthy of contemplation. Here it is recorded.

Wei Zhong was magnanimous and fond of learning. He shut his door to cultivate himself, refusing to associate with the men of his time. Pei Gu spoke of him several times to Zhang Hua, who summoned him to office, but Wei declined on grounds of illness. When asked the reason, he replied: “I am but a thatched-roof rustic, with no ambition for officialdom. Moreover, Maoxian [Zhang Hua] is all blossom and no fruit, while Pei is ever desirous yet never satisfied. To abandon classical rites and cling to the heels of traitors—is this conduct befitting a true gentleman?” Pei had long harbored designs on him, but Wei feared that if great waves toppled the mountains, even the ripples might sweep him away—how then could he approach the tail of a tiger and risk scalding burns?

Zhang Han possessed refined talent and excelled in literary composition. When He Xun of Kuaiji received a summons to Luoyang, he passed through Wu, playing the zither within his vermilion gates. Though Han did not know him, he approached and engaged him in conversation, and the two took great delight in each other. Learning that He was bound for Luoyang, Han remarked, “I too have business in the Northern Capital.” They departed together in the same carriage, without even informing Han’s family.

The Prince of Qi summoned Han to serve as Gentleman of the Yellow Gate. As power was then concentrated in the prince’s hands, Han said to his fellow townsman Gu Rong: “The world is in turmoil, and calamity shows no sign of abating. For one with a name spanning the Four Seas, retreat is exceedingly difficult. I am but a man of the mountains and forests, with no aspirations for this age. You would do well to guard against danger ahead with clarity and contemplate what lies behind with wisdom.” Gu grasped his hand, moved to tears, and said: “I too shall join you in gathering bracken on South Mountain and drinking from the Three Rivers.” Soon after, Han saw the autumn wind rise and longed for the water oats and caltrop of Wu, the fine wine and sliced perch. He mused: “In life, what matters most is following one’s heart. How could I endure an official’s palanquin for thousands of miles just to chase after empty titles?” He promptly ordered his carriage and returned home. People praised him for perceiving the subtle signs.

**Recorded Note:** In Wei’s refusal of Zhang Maoxian’s summons, he discerned the signs before any movement had begun—this is what is meant by resolute action and nurturing virtue. Thus, when a spring emerges from the foot of a mountain, though it has yet to encounter peril or find its course, like clouds ungathered above the peak or waves unstirred upon the water, it remains beyond reach. In Zhang Jiying’s [Han’s] departure from Gu Yanxian [Rong], he feared disaster only after it had become visible—this is what is meant by perilous virtue and avoiding calamity. Thus, when Heaven and Earth fail to commune, the Way of the petty man grows long while the Way of the noble man wanes, like water sinking into drowning depths or fire raging in scorching flames—there is no time to delay. Does not Mencius say: some distance themselves, some draw near; some depart, some remain—all to preserve the purity of their person? Are these not men of clear wisdom?

Yan Han’s restrained wisdom won the admiration of the multitude. He formed a deep bond with Deng You, once remarking: “Z

Here the admiration of Renjie for Shide, though at first indifferent, ultimately turned to reverence—what harm did this do to their unity? What of Pei Xingjian’s discernment of men? When he first met the future examination graduate Wang Bo and the Xianyang constable Su Weidao—both then unknown—he declared: “These two will in time succeed one another in overseeing the selection of officials. I have a young daughter, and I would entrust her to your care.” At that time, Wang Bo’s younger brother, along with Yang Jiong of Huayin, Lu Zhaolin of Fanyang, and Luo Binwang of Yiwu, all enjoyed great renown for their literary brilliance. Li Jingxuan held them in especially high regard, certain they would rise to prominence. Xingjian, however, remarked: “For a scholar to go far, he must first cultivate his character and judgment, and only then his talents and skills. Though these men possess literary refinement, they are restless and shallow, hardly vessels fit to receive rank and emolument. Yang alone is somewhat composed and may yet become a district magistrate; the rest will be fortunate to die in peace.” Later, Bo drowned in the Southern Sea, Zhaolin threw himself into the Ying River, Binwang was executed for rebellion, and Jiong ended his days as magistrate of Yingchuan. Bo and Weidao both oversaw the selection of officials—all exactly as Xingjian had foretold.

The Record states: Confucius praised Zigong as a *hulian* vessel—this is what is meant by character and judgment. King Wen commended the unhewn timber of the talented scholar—this is what is meant by talents and skills. Yet one must first possess the substance of gold or jade before carving its patterns. As for those mere clay pots, no matter how brightly adorned, can they ever serve in the ancestral temple? Jia Yi was a man of exceptional talent, yet the noble man still faulted him for his grand ambitions and narrow capacity, his surplus of talent but want of judgment—how much more so the Four Masters! Thus the noble man values himself all the more, not content merely to craft fine phrases.

In *The History of the Song*, it is recorded that Zhang Yong and Fu Lin of Qingzhou were schoolmates in their youth. Lin withdrew from public life, while Yong rose to prominence. For thirty years, Yong sought Lin in vain. One day, Lin arrived unannounced. When the clerks announced “Fu Lin requests an audience,” Yong rebuked them: “Master Fu is a scholar of the realm—even I cannot claim him as a friend. Who are you to address him by name?” Lin smiled and said: “After a lifetime apart, you still cling to such formalities? Does this mean you remain unaware that there exists in the world a man named Fu Lin?” Yong asked: “Why did you withdraw before, and why have you emerged now?” Lin replied: “You are about to depart, and I have come to bid you farewell.” Yong said: “I knew it myself.” Lin said: “Then what more is there to say?” The next day, he took leave of Yong’s family. A month later, Yong passed away.

The Record states: This resembles the bond between Yuan Bo and Ju Qing—such is the power of sincerity, which knows no bounds. Thus when hearts mirror one another, nothing stands between them. Yet even the recluse of Shu Mountain, who could foresee events ten years hence by stilling his thoughts, cannot compare to Fu Lin, who remained secluded for thirty years. His freedom from worldly enticements and his ability to cast off wealth and honor are plain to see.

Bi Zhongyou was deeply favored by Sima Guang, Lü Gongzhu, and Fan Chunren. At the time, Su Shi served in the Hanlin Academy, often critiquing current policies through his words and writings. Fearing he would invite disaster, Zhongyou wrote to warn him: “Mencius spoke only when compelled, and Confucius wished to remain silent. The ancients, in their meticulous planning and deepest reflections, sought to establish their achievements and preserve their lives—never did they stray from this principle. Since entering court, you have never weighed the consequences of fortune or misfortune, gain or loss, as they pertain to your person. The harm of speech is not limited to what leaves the mouth; it manifests in poems and songs, in praises and odes, in inscriptions and prefaces—all are forms of speech. Now you fear what you say aloud but not what you commit to writing. When you affirm what you believe, those who agree will rejoice; when you condemn what you oppose, those you offend will resent you. Those who rejoice cannot advance your designs, while those who resent may already be undermining your affairs. The world already associates your name with your writings. Even if your words contain no explicit judgments, suspicions of bias will still arise—how much worse if they do! You hold no office as remonstrator or censor, yet you risk your safety to provoke taboos, courting danger as recklessly as a rolling stone or a drowning man.”

The Record states: According to historical accounts, Chao Gu was a fellow townsman of the Three Su in Meishan and had long been close to them. Yet when the Su brothers rose to prominence in the same court, he never once visited them. When they were exiled in succession to the southern frontiers, none of their old friends or relatives reached out—only Chao Gu, alone in Meishan, sought out the two Su brothers. They were astonished and overjoyed, exclaiming: “This is no man of our time—he is a man of antiquity!” I humbly submit that what sets the men of antiquity apart from those of today is their weighty sense of duty in admonishing others. And the essence of such admonition lies first in wisdom and clarity. Had the two Su brothers heeded Zhongyou’s words earlier and benefited from his forthright counsel, they might not have been banished to the ends of the earth. And Chao Gu’s name, so striking to the ear, would not have appeared in the historical record. Instead of valuing loyal warnings, they boasted of their extraordinary conduct—this Record, in omitting Yuan Xiu and including Ju Gongshu, reflects the same principle of preserving oneself and speaking with caution.

Shao Bowen was the son of Shao Yong. Yong’s reputation was immense in his time, and he associated with Sima Guang, the two Cheng brothers, and other eminent scholars. Thus Bowen, raised on his father’s teachings and serving these great men, acquired a broad and penetrating understanding of affairs, particularly those most pressing. When Emperor Shenzong passed and Zhezong ascended the throne, Cai Que still held the position of chief minister. Xing Shu, transferred from Xiangzhou to Heyang, visited Que to conspire on the matter of establishing the succession. By then, Guang had already died, and his son Kang was expected at court. Shu summoned him to Heyang. Bowen advised: “You have not yet completed your mourning rites. Before presenting yourself to the emperor, you should not take a detour to visit friends.” Kang replied: “I have already agreed.” Bowen said: “Shu is cunning and opportunistic. He may use this to pressure you. If you comply, you will surely regret it later.” Kang went regardless, and Shu indeed urged him to write a letter praising Que. Kang, being of the same examination year as Shu and a disciple of Guang, complied and wrote the letter as Shu instructed.

Cai Que and his faction, considering Kang the son of Guang, believed that if they claimed Que had rendered meritorious service in establishing the succession, the world would surely credit it, thus securing Kang’s future and protecting his family. Later, when Liang Tao was summoned as a remonstrance official, Shu also lured him to Heyang, where they debated day and night. Que presented Kang’s letter as evidence, but Tao was displeased. Coincidentally, Wu Chuhou memorialized that Que’s poems had slandered the court. Tao and Liu Anshe jointly petitioned for Que’s execution and Shu’s punishment. The court ordered Kang to adjudicate the case, and only then did he regret his actions.

After Kang’s death, his son Zhi was still young. Empress Dowager Xuanren took pity on him, and Lü Taifang, noting that Kang had always trusted Bowen, requested that Bowen be appointed professor of the Western Capital to educate Zhi. Upon arrival, Bowen admonished: “The grandson of Wengong, the son of a great remonstrator—whether wise or foolish, the world watches with awe.” Hearing this, Zhi studied diligently without respite and ultimately established himself.

At the beginning of the Shaosheng era, Zhang Dun became chief minister. Dun had once served Kangjie and wished to employ Bowen, but Bowen refused. When the law required him to report to the Ministry of Personnel for appointment, Cheng Yi warned: “I fear for your journey.” Bowen replied: “Would I not wish to meet my late father in the underworld?” Upon arrival, he first accepted the ministry’s official assignment before meeting the chief minister. Dun then broached the subject of Kangjie’s learning, sighing: “Alas, I could not complete my studies under the Master.” Bowen said: “My late father’s ‘Pre-Celestial Learning’ expounded upon heaven, earth, and the myriad things—nothing was left unexplained. If one truly believes in it, even the enmity of those who turn against one can be forgotten.” At the time, Dun was instigating factional persecutions, so Bowen sought to move him with these words. Dun was momentarily shaken and recommended him to the court, but Bowen requested a local post. Displeased, Dun appointed him supervisor of the Yongxing Army’s coin-casting office.

At that time, the worthies of the Yuanyou era were being exiled south, and few scholars visited them. Bowen met Fan Zuyu in Xianping and Fan Chunren in Yingchang, undeterred by the risks. Earlier, Yong had once said: “When the world is about to descend into chaos, only Shu remains safe—one should flee there in time.” At the end of the Xuanhe era, Bowen moved his family to Shu and thus escaped disaster.

Zhao Ding, who had studied under Bowen in his youth, later inscribed his tomb: “Rising through learning and conduct in the Yuanyou era, upholding moral integrity in the Shaosheng era, and being anciently dismissed in the Chongning era.” The world took these three phrases to summarize Bowen’s life’s course.

**Recorded Reflection:**
In my humble observation, Kangjie not only foresaw the rise and fall of the past but also verified the order and chaos of the future. His son Bowen not only did no disservice to his father but also sought to benefit his friends. Looking back today: of the eminent ministers of the Yuanyou era, who among those who bowed their heads to execution preserved themselves? Of the foremost disciples of the Two Chengs, who among those whose families were harmed protected their households? Acting rashly brings regret, and one’s reputation is ruined; rushing to martyrdom for others leads to one’s own destruction. Falling into enmity is pitiable in human terms, while blindly following the tide violates the principles of things. Why not strive in a well-governed court and avoid calamity in a chaotic age? Advancing through the gate of the sages, one may be called prescient—this is the unconfused wisdom of the enlightened, not something to be burdened by those who attribute all to fate and qi.

**From the *Reflections on Things at Hand*:**
Zhang Hengqu asked Cheng Mingdao: “Though I cannot yet still my nature from being disturbed, I am still troubled by external things. What should I do?”
Mingdao replied: “What is called stillness is stillness in motion and stillness in quietude—without grasping or rejecting, without inner or outer. If you regard external things as external and allow them to pull you along, you treat your own nature as having an inside and an outside. Moreover, if you consider your nature as following things externally, then when it is outside, what remains inside? This is to deliberately cut off external temptations while failing to recognize that nature has no inside or outside. Having divided inner and outer into two roots, how can you suddenly speak of stillness? The constancy of heaven and earth lies in their mind pervading the myriad things without a mind of their own; the constancy of the sage lies in their emotions responding to the myriad affairs without being bound by emotion. Thus, the learning of the noble person should be nothing less than vast and impartial, responding to things as they come.

*The Book of Changes* says: ‘Persistence brings good fortune and eliminates regret. Though thoughts come and go, friends follow your intent.’ If you rigidly focus on removing external temptations, you will find them vanishing in the east only to arise in the west—not only are they unworthy of concern, but their beginnings are endless and cannot be eradicated. Human emotions each have their blind spots, so they cannot accord with the Dao. The general problem lies in selfishness and the use of cleverness. Selfishness prevents one from taking action as a proper response; the use of cleverness prevents one from attaining clarity and awareness as natural. Now, to hate external things and seek a realm where nothing exists is like turning a mirror backward to seek its reflection.

*The Book of Changes* says: ‘Stopping at the back, one does not obtain one’s body; walking in the courtyard, one does not see others.’ Rather than rejecting the external and affirming the internal, it is better to forget both inner and outer. When both are forgotten, the mind becomes clear and unburdened; unburdened, it is still; still, it is bright; bright, it is lofty. How then can responding to things be a hindrance? The sage’s joy arises from what is right to rejoice in; the sage’s anger arises from what is right to be angry at. Thus, the sage’s joy and anger are not tied to the heart but are triggered by things. Does the sage not respond to things? How can one deem following the external as wrong and seek what is within as right? Now, compare the joy and anger of those who are selfish and use cleverness with the proper joy and anger of the sage—how do they measure up?

Of human emotions, anger is the easiest to arouse and the hardest to control. Yet if, in the moment of anger, one can suddenly forget the anger and examine the rightness or wrongness of the matter, one may see that external temptations are not worth hating and may grasp more than half of the Dao.

**Recorded Reflection:**
In my humble observation, the essay *On Stabilizing One’s Nature* reveals the Master’s profound and unique attainment, surpassing what other scholars could achieve.

When one is burdened by external things, one cannot reclaim one’s wandering heart. Yet in stabilizing the nature, there is no grasping or rejecting, no inner or outer, and movement and stillness merge into oneness. The most wondrous attainment lies in being vast and empty like the Grand Duke, responding to things as they come. All reasoning and verification return to this. Yet what can be pointed to and easily aged is none other than the emotions, hence the discussion of joy and anger. If one seeks the path of progress, it begins with forgetting anger and examining principle.

The essence of this essay lies in illuminating natural awareness, while its greatest warning is against selfishness and the use of cunning. It aligns with Yanzi’s luminous insight, Zengzi’s stability and tranquil reflection, Zisi’s sincerity and clarity of nature, Mencius’s foundation in profit, and Master Zhou’s enlightened universality—nothing is left unexhausted. This is why it surpasses all ages, and why it need not wait for confusion to be deemed a completed work.

Lu Jiuyuan, at the age of three or four, asked his father: “Where do the boundaries of heaven and earth end?” His father laughed without answering, and Jiuyuan pondered deeply, even forgetting to sleep or rest. As he grew older, he differed from others. All who met him as a child respected him, saying: “When I hear others recite Master Yichuan’s words, why do they not resemble the teachings of Confucius and Mencius?” Upon first reading the *Analects*, he doubted the words of Master You. Later, while reading, he encountered the term “universe.” The commentary explained: “The four directions and above and below are called *yu*; past and present are called *zhou*.” Suddenly, he had a great awakening: “Matters within the universe are matters within my own duty. Matters within my own duty are matters within the universe.”

He also once said: “If a sage were to emerge from the Eastern Sea, this heart would be the same, this principle would be the same. Even if a sage were to emerge from the Western, Southern, or Northern Seas, it would be no different. A thousand or ten thousand generations ago, if a sage had emerged, this heart would be the same, this principle would be the same. And a thousand or ten thousand generations hence, if a sage were to emerge, this heart and this principle would remain unchanged.”

After passing the imperial examinations, when he arrived at the temporary capital, scholars vied to study under him. His words inspired and moved many to action. He did not rely on rigid learning rules. If a student had a minor fault, his words would strike their emotions, sometimes even bringing them to sweat. For those harboring confusion they could not articulate, he would analyze the causes, making their hearts fully known. Even those separated by a thousand *li* could, upon hearing his broad principles, grasp his character.

He once said: “When thoughts and considerations are improper, one can recognize this in an instant and correct them. When thoughts and considerations are proper, if they are lost in an instant, they become improper.” To his students, he said: “Your ears are naturally sharp, your eyes naturally bright. You can naturally be filial to your father and respectful to your elder brother. There is nothing lacking—no need to seek elsewhere.”

He also said: “Speaking of the Dao to those drowned in profit and desire is still easy. Speaking to those drowned in rigid opinions is far more difficult.” When urged to write books, he replied: “The Six Classics annotate me; I annotate the Six Classics. If one truly understands the Dao, the Six Classics are all my footnotes.”

Once, he met Zhu Xi at Ehu Lake, and their discussions on learning often diverged. Later, when Zhu Xi governed Nankang, Jiuyuan visited him. Zhu Xi took him to the White Deer Grotto, where Jiuyuan lectured on the passage: “The gentleman is guided by righteousness; the petty person is guided by profit.” Zhu Xi believed his words precisely targeted the hidden and pervasive flaws of scholars, so much so that some listeners were moved to tears.

**Recorded Reflection:**
In my humble observation, the differences between the teachings of Zhu and Lu arise from their innate dispositions. From the age of three or four, Jiuyuan already explored the boundaries of heaven and earth. How could he not, in maturity, focus on nature? Zhu Xi, however, accumulated knowledge bit by bit, inch by inch. How could he not, in the end, focus on learning? Yet the strengths of these two masters each reach their own depths, neither conflicting nor contradicting. It is like the disciples of the Sage: Zengzi’s talent was slow, Zigong’s nature was quick, yet both attained the same unity through the Sage’s guidance. Now, with no sage appearing in the world, each master establishes their own school, lacking a unifying authority. Thus, differences and disputes arise, and those who follow them echo their divisions, unaware of how to honor the cultivation of virtue and the pursuit of learning. Zisi, who transmitted the teachings of Confucius, never favored one over the other—how could they be divided into two? Would it not be better if the great Dao were impartial? If one fears their wisdom does not fully apply to oneself, they should not reject what differs from them. If one fears their learning does not benefit others, they should not force it upon them. If this were so, no one in their time could criticize them, and later generations would have no grounds for reproach. Would this not be the great harmony?

I fear that later critics will grow ever more numerous and stray further from the truth. This record aims to propagate the Dao, and thus cannot be omitted.

**From *Shuidong’s Records*:**
Master Wu Sian of Ming once said: “When shallow scholars of the world discuss later generations, they often say: ‘These are mere *Yunfu* and *Tan Yu*, scholars who merely chase the ferryboat.’” This refers to their fragmented and disjointed learning, like idle chatter among travelers, lacking any profound insight or key understanding.

The Master was well-versed in the *Records of the Historian* from a young age. Exceptionally perceptive, he surpassed others in his reading, leaving no book unexamined. He once traveled with his late father through various regions, gaining broad experience. Upon retiring, he cultivated and nurtured himself for thirty or forty years. Thus, his learning was vast yet precise, his spirit firm and great, his insight lofty and clear. His works, such as *On the Nature and Principle* and *Annotations on the Elementary Learning*, contributed to the legacy of the Confucian masters. His discussions on the profundities of nature and principle were especially illuminating.

The Record states: The Master rose to prominence through recommendations rather than the imperial examinations, yet his words precisely diagnosed the ailments of contemporary scholars and officials—far surpassing the likes of Zhang, Cheng, Zhu, and Lu of former times. Should not learners then awaken with urgency? Here ends this record.

**On Trust: The Trust Between Ruler and Minister**

From the *Book of Han*: King Huai of Chu made a pact with his generals, declaring that whoever first entered and pacified the Guanzhong region would be enfeoffed as its king. At that time, the Qin forces were strong, and their commanders, ever victorious, pursued fleeing enemies. None of the generals dared to be the first to enter the pass—save Xiang Yu, who harbored deep resentment over Qin’s killing of Xiang Liang. He vowed to join the Lord of Pei in marching west into the pass. The elder generals of King Huai all advised: "Xiang Yu is fierce, cruel, and treacherous. When he once attacked Xiangcheng, not a soul was left alive; wherever he passed, none survived. It would be better to send a virtuous elder to proceed west with righteousness, to proclaim the will of the Qin fathers and brothers. The people of Qin have long suffered under their ruler. If we truly send a man of virtue, who commits no violence or oppression, the land should readily submit. Xiang Yu cannot be sent—only the Lord of Pei, known for his magnanimity and virtue, is fit for this task." King Huai thus refused Xiang Yu and dispatched the Lord of Pei to the west to secure the territory.

The Record states: Was King Huai of Chu comparable to Gengshi of Han? Huai favored the Lord of Pei and rejected Xiang Yu. Observing his words in dispatching his generals, one might have hoped for a semblance of sovereign wisdom. Yet in the end, he fell to the humiliation of brute force—what is called "crossing the river only to drown," a fate beyond reproach. Gengshi, on the other hand, resented Liu Ji and seized Liu Xian, his craven demeanor revealing his true mediocrity. Yet he brought upon himself the guilt of treacherous murder—what is called "the stocks crushing his neck, his ears and eyes failing him." How could their outcomes be the same?

After the Lord of Pei pacified Guanzhong, he summoned all the elders and local leaders of the counties, declaring: "For too long, you have suffered under Qin’s harsh laws. Those who slandered were exterminated, and those who spoke in pairs were executed in the marketplace. I shall rule Guanzhong and establish but three laws with you: those who kill shall die; those who injure or steal shall be punished accordingly. All other Qin laws shall be abolished. Officials and people shall remain in their posts as before. I have come solely to relieve you of harm, not to oppress or violate you. Have no fear. I have stationed my army at Bashang to await the arrival of the other lords and finalize our agreements." He then sent men with Qin officials to the counties, towns, and villages to proclaim this. The people of Qin rejoiced greatly, vying to offer cattle, sheep, wine, and food to the soldiers. The Lord of Pei declined, saying: "Our granaries are full; we lack nothing and do not wish to burden the people." The people rejoiced even more, fearing only that the Lord of Pei would not become King of Qin.

The Record states: The foundation of the Western Han’s two-hundred-year enterprise was ultimately secured in Guanzhong through this initial compact. Mencius said: "Terrain is not as advantageous as harmony among the people." Jia Yi’s argument likewise held: "Without the practice of benevolence and righteousness, the dynamics of offense and defense shift." Now, observing the debates at the Han court—so varied and discordant—even figures like Lou Jing and Tian Ken are not worth deep scrutiny. As for Zhang Liang’s wisdom, one would expect greater discernment, yet he too followed the residual thread of Li Yiji, failing to grasp the fundamental truth. He did not realize that the Three Articles of Law were worthier than the strategic advantage of "a hundred men holding two," nor that the people’s contentment in their homes outweighed the tactical posture of "establishing the capital at the neck of the land." Though one might wish to abandon such measures, the mountains and rivers would not permit it. Thus, is a fortress of metal and stone truly superior to the hearts of the elders? Is the fertility of a rich land more valuable than the humble offerings of wine and grain? Xiang Yu may have broken a temporary pact, but could he overturn the cauldron of a hundred generations?

When Emperor Wen was first enfeoffed as King of Dai, the Lü clan had been exterminated, and the great ministers deliberated to welcome and enthrone the King of Dai. Zhang Wu and others among the assembled ministers said: "The Han ministers are former generals and commanders from the time of the late Emperor Gao. Skilled in warfare and full of schemes, they cannot be trusted. We should claim illness and refuse to go, observing their maneuvers." Palace Attendant Song Chang countered: "Not so. When Qin lost its governance, heroes rose in every corner, each believing they could claim the throne. Yet in the end, it was the House of Liu that ascended. Even under the stern authority of Empress Lü, who monopolized power, when the Grand Commandant entered the Northern Army with a single tally and issued a call, the soldiers all bared their left shoulders for the House of Liu, ultimately annihilating the Lü clan. This was the mandate of Heaven, not the work of men. The King of Dai is renowned throughout the realm for his sagacity, benevolence, and filial piety. The great ministers, acting on the will of the realm, have come to welcome and enthrone him. The King should have no doubts." When the King of Dai arrived in Chang’an, the Grand Commandant Zhou Bo sought an audience. Song Chang said: "Matters of public concern should be spoken openly; matters of private concern have no place for a king." The Grand Commandant then knelt and presented the imperial seal and tally. That night, Song Chang was appointed General of the Guards, commanding both the Southern and Northern Armies, while Zhang Wu was made Prefect of the Palace Gentlemen, overseeing the palace halls.

The Record states: The empire of Emperor Wen’s twenty-three years was secured by the single utterance of Song Chang—how could Zhang Wu and his ilk compare? His refusal of the Grand Commandant’s request, resolute in word and intent, further revealed the sincerity of his heart. Who would have thought that in the humble residence of Dai, such a man could emerge—such a man! The Emperor’s enfeoffment of Chang was well justified. As for Zhang Wu and his associates, though their offices did not exceed the Nine Ministers, this was sufficient to demonstrate the king’s impartiality. Was it merely to spare the inch of land for Zhu Xu, or to uphold the trust of the great ministers and reassure their hearts? If so, then those who spoke openly may have ultimately failed, while those who sought leisure cannot be blamed.

Emperor Wen wrote to Zhao Tuo, King of Nanyue: "I am the son of a lesser consort of the late Emperor Gao. Exiled to the northern frontier in Dai, the distance was vast, and I was cut off, simple and ignorant, never having sent letters to the late Emperor or abandoned the assembled ministers."

When Emperor Hui passed away, Empress Dowager Gao personally took charge of affairs, but alas, she fell ill, and the Lü clan staged a rebellion, which was suppressed only through the efforts of the meritorious ministers. Once the matter was settled, We, though a king and marquis, were not released from duty by the officials, and thus had no choice but to ascend the throne.

Recently, We received a letter from Your Majesty to General Longlü and the Marquis of Longlü, seeking to claim kinship with your brothers and reproaching the two generals of Changsha for their dismissal. In response to Your Majesty’s letter, We dismissed the generals. As for the Marquis of Boyang, your own brother in Zhen Ding, We have already sent envoys to inquire after him, tend to the tombs of your ancestors, and make repairs.

Previously, We heard that Your Majesty had mobilized troops along the border, causing unceasing raids and disasters. At that time, Changsha suffered greatly, and Nan Commandery suffered even more. Even if it were your own domain, could such actions truly benefit you? They would only result in the slaughter of many soldiers, the wounding of good generals, the widowing of wives, the orphaning of children, and the bereavement of parents—gaining one while losing ten. We cannot bear to do such a thing.

We wished to adjust the borders where they interlock like dog’s teeth, and so We consulted the officials. They said: "This was how the late Emperor Gao demarcated the land of Changsha." Thus, We could not alter it without authority. Now, even if We were to gain your territory, it would not be of great significance.

Obtaining the king’s wealth would not suffice to make Us rich. All lands south of the Ling Ridge shall remain under your governance. Yet though your title is "Emperor," two emperors cannot coexist—this would leave not even a single chariot’s worth of gain. To force communication through such a path is contention, and contention without yielding is not the way of the benevolent. We wish to cast aside past grievances with you. From this day forward, let envoys resume their former exchanges as before.

When Lu Jia arrived in Nanyue, the King of Nanyue kowtowed in apology, pledging to obey Our enlightened decree and serve forever as a vassal, offering tribute and fulfilling his duties.

**Recorded Note:**
Confucius told Zizhang: "Speak with loyalty and sincerity, act with earnest respect—even in the lands of the Man and Mo, this will suffice." As for Nanyue, Wei Tuo was but one among those condemned. Even without the majesty of ten thousand chariots, who would not heed the words of a lesser house? Had he not heeded them, who would not boast of the Central Kingdom’s grandeur and the might of its arms? Yet he did not realize that Heaven bestows the Mandate upon the Emperor through perfect virtue, and the Emperor, in turn, wields his perfect name with unrestrained authority. His words arose from his heart, unforced, truly capable of piercing metal and stone, reaching even the swine and fish, the Yi, Di, Man, and Mo—are they not also men? His heart rejoiced and submitted in sincerity, not merely by compulsion but as naturally as could be.

Zizhang could only inscribe such words on his sash but failed to put them into practice. The Emperor’s innate disposition aligned with the Dao, and though he lacked the merit of "measuring with the plumb line and balancing with the scale," his achievements were manifest and great. Thus, the Sage’s words stand between Heaven and Earth like the work of Creation, effortlessly shaping all things—no need to listen or observe, for they command all faces and directions.

He also sent a letter to the Chanyu of the Xiongnu, saying: "The Emperor respectfully inquires after the Great Chanyu of the Xiongnu. Recently, We received your letter expressing the wish to cease hostilities, rest the troops, erase past grievances, and restore the old treaty to bring peace to the border peoples and eternal harmony. We greatly approve—this is the aspiration of the ancient sage-kings. Han and the Xiongnu pledged brotherhood, and thus We have sent you generous gifts. Yet those who break the treaty and sever fraternal bonds have always been the Xiongnu. However, the matter of the Right Virtuous King occurred before the amnesty and shall not be deeply pursued. If the Chanyu upholds the meaning of this letter and clearly instructs his officials to avoid violating the treaty, maintaining trust and respect as stated in your letter..."

**Recorded Note:**
In observing the Emperor’s treaty with the Xiongnu, how could it compare to the *Spring and Autumn Annals’* oaths invoking ghosts and gods, or the covenant sealed with blood? His sincerity and trust arose from his true heart, as expressed in his words—like Heaven and Earth, which sustain and cover all without exception. Truly, he mastered the way of the Emperor in governing the Yi and Di. Not only did he secure their trust, but he also knew how to treat them. Hu and Yue as one family, Hua and Yi as one body—when future generations look back upon this day, will it not be deemed magnificent?

Once, while the Emperor was traveling and crossing the Zhongwei Bridge, a man ran across the bridge, startling the imperial carriage’s horses. Riders were sent to capture him. At the time, Zhang Shizhi served as Commandant of Justice and memorialized that the man should be fined. The Emperor angrily said: "This man personally startled my horse. Had the horse not been gentle, would another not have thrown me and injured me? Yet the Commandant of Justice only imposes a fine!" Shizhi replied: "The law is shared by all under Heaven. If the law is as it stands, and you now increase the penalty, the law will lose credibility among the people."

Later, someone stole a jade ring from before the seat of the Gao Temple. When caught, the case was also sent to the Commandant of Justice for judgment. Shizhi memorialized that the thief should be executed in the marketplace. The Emperor was furious: "This man is lawless, stealing an object of the former Emperor. I wished to execute his entire clan, yet you, citing the law, oppose me—this is not how We should jointly uphold the ancestral temples." Shizhi removed his cap, kowtowed, and apologized, saying: "The law is sufficient as it stands. If stealing from the ancestral temple warrants extermination of one’s clan, then suppose a foolish commoner took a cup of earth from Changling—what greater punishment could Your Majesty impose?" The Emperor then relented.

**Recorded Note:**
People know that Shizhi upheld the law, but they do not realize the Emperor’s ability to employ it. The world does not complain of the law’s unfairness but only of the ruler’s failure to apply it. Gaoyao said, "It lies in punishment," and the Emperor echoed, "It lies in punishment." Gaoyao said, "It lies in leniency," and the Emperor echoed, "It lies in leniency"—this is the ability to employ the law. If one’s words suffice to refute remonstrance and one’s wisdom suffices to gloss over wrongs, believing all under Heaven are beneath oneself, one cannot employ the law. Thus, if branding is insufficient, it escalates to burning; if burning is insufficient, it escalates to dismemberment—was there truly no law in these cases?

After the Han established the Three Articles of Law, Emperor Wen abolished mutilating punishments, the confiscation of wives and children for a relative’s crime, and the prosecution of slander and heretical speech—his heart was truly rooted in loving the people. The offenses of startling the imperial procession and stealing the jade ring arose from momentary anger, a private matter; the fines and execution were the law’s public measure. Only by refusing to let private concerns override the public did he not ultimately bend the law with emotion. The Emperor may be likened to Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon.

Beyond this, figures like Zhang and Du of Youning manipulated legal cases according to the ruler’s whims—from this, one may infer the nature of the rulers of that time. Alas! The mere mention of "a cup of earth from Changling" was something ministers could not bear to hear. If one fears and avoids such words, what is the reason? Thus, it is said: Those who know Shizhi upheld the law but do not recognize the Emperor’s ability to employ it do not truly understand the law.

Ni Kuan, during Emperor Wu’s reign, served as a Palace Grandee and was promoted to Left Internal Minister. In governing the people, he observed agriculture and sericulture, relaxed punishments, adjudicated lawsuits, humbled himself before scholars, and focused on winning the people’s hearts. He selected and employed benevolent and generous officials, extended empathy to his subordinates, and did not seek fame. The officials and people greatly trusted and loved him. When collecting taxes, he adjusted the rates flexibly, and the people borrowed from one another, so much so that many taxes went uncollected.

When the military campaign later concluded, Ni Kuan was ranked last in tax collection due to arrears. Upon hearing this, the people, fearing his demotion, mobilized en masse—wealthy households with ox-carts, poorer ones with shoulder poles—delivering taxes in an unbroken stream until his assessment became the highest. Later, he rose through the ranks to become Imperial Censor.

It is recorded: Though Ni Kuan was originally a Confucian scholar, his governance of the people may be called Confucian, but not truly *legalist*. Why? In the present age, officials of the Direct Inspectorate regard flexible tax collection as a breach of discipline, and a single demotion or promotion cannot be easily overturned—how much less so during military mobilization? Yet in the Han, where laws were loose and prohibitions lenient, such customs could still be witnessed. These customs were far superior to those of degenerate eras. Had he not been a man of warmth and integrity, steadfast in his principles, how could this have been achieved? Otherwise, with the prevalence of cunning and deceitful men, who would have spurred the people—wealthy households with ox-carts, poorer ones with shoulder poles—to act thus? This shows that trust and affection prevail over penal law, and Confucian officials stand apart from vulgar clerks—hence it must be recorded.

During Emperor Xuan’s reign, Zhang Anshi and Du Yannian both held positions among the Nine Ministers. Both were renowned for their loyalty and trustworthiness, meticulous and discreet in all matters, whether internal or external. Whenever major policies were decided, they would feign illness and withdraw, so that even the court’s highest ministers remained unaware of their involvement. When they recommended someone, and that person came to express gratitude, they would grow furious, declaring: *"To recommend the worthy and capable—how could there be private thanks?"* Once, a palace gentleman of great merit, passed over for promotion, spoke of it himself. Anshi replied: *"Your merit is known to the enlightened ruler. As a minister, how can you speak of such things yourself?"* When his chief clerk was about to depart for a new post, Anshi asked him to point out his faults. The clerk said: *"The General serves as the ruler’s right hand, yet no scholars are advanced under him."* Critics took this as a rebuke. Anshi responded: *"With an enlightened ruler above, the worthy and unworthy are clearly distinguished. A minister need only cultivate himself—how would he know whom to recommend?"* Thus, he sought to conceal his name, avoid border posts, and distance himself from power. The Son of Heaven deeply respected and feared the Grand General, yet privately favored Anshi, trusting him even more than [Huang] Guang.

Du Yannian was likewise gentle and composed, thorough in all affairs. Having long overseen court administration, the emperor trusted him completely. When the emperor went out, Yannian attended his carriage; when he returned, Yannian served as a palace attendant. At that time, the four barbarians were at peace, and the realm was tranquil. After the Grand General’s death, Yannian alone maintained his position from beginning to end, earning universal praise.

It is recorded: Since Confucius declined the flawless sacrificial ox, critics have often misjudged men, and even great worthies are not exempt—how much less so for Anshi and Yannian? Yet some argue: *"Heaven’s way is retribution,"* but this is a shallow view. Does Heaven concern itself with such trifles? If one does evil, all under Heaven and posterity will call him evil; if one does good, all will call him good—is this not all the more credible? To foresee what has not yet come to pass, without observing what has already occurred—I have never seen such discernment. The loyalty, trustworthiness, prudence, and sincerity of these two ministers embody what Confucius meant when he said: *"Even if you wished not to employ them, would the mountains and rivers abandon them?"* Thus, the lofty essence of the Sage’s judgment is again evident.

Han Yanshou served as Governor of Yingchuan, where powerful clans made the commandery difficult to govern. Previously, Zhao Guanghan had been troubled by the prevalence of cliques among the people, so he incited officials and commoners to inform on one another. Yanshou sought to change this but feared the people would not comply. He summoned the commandery’s elders—those trusted and esteemed in their villages—and hosted them with food and drink. Speaking to them face-to-face, he inquired about local customs, then discussed and established standards for weddings, funerals, and sacrifices, roughly following ancient rites without exceeding legal bounds. When collecting taxes, he first issued clear proclamations, setting deadlines as a priority. Initially, this seemed cumbersome, but later, officials were spared the toil of chasing delinquents, and the people were free from the fear of beatings. All found it convenient and settled into it.

He treated his subordinate officials with great generosity, yet his covenants were clear and strict. If any dared deceive or bully others, he would immediately reproach himself, saying: "Have I failed them? How could this have come to pass?" The people revered and trusted his teachings, and within several years, Yingchuan was thoroughly governed.

Later, he was promoted to serve as Left Fengxu. While touring the counties and arriving at Gaoling, he encountered two brothers disputing over farmland. Yanshou was deeply grieved, saying: "Fortunate to hold this office as a model for others, I have failed to propagate and clarify moral instruction, allowing kin to engage in litigation. This harms public morality, and the fault lies with me, Fengxu." He then retired to the post station’s outer quarters, shut the gates, and reflected on his errors. He ordered his magistrates and clerks to bind themselves and await punishment. Hearing of this, the litigants reproached one another, shaving their heads and baring their shoulders in apology. They pledged to cede the land to each other, vowing never to dispute again, even unto death. Overjoyed, Yanshou emerged to resume his duties. Throughout the commandery, all were moved, and none dared transgress. Thus, his virtue and trust extended across all twenty-four counties, and none dared bring forth lawsuits.

The record states: In my humble view, Yanshou seemed intent on transforming customs and guiding officials and people to turn their hearts toward goodness. Yet in the end, he could not secure a virtuous conclusion. Why was this so?

The former Confucians have said: Of the figures since the Three Dynasties, all acted on the impulses of blood and qi, unlike those before the Three Dynasties, who relied purely on virtue and nature. Alas! This saying applies not only to Yanshou, but also to Zhao Gai and Yang Mo—none were exceptions. By this time in the Han court, the primal qi had already dissipated. Yet in the end, they still fell into the warning of "favoring trust but not learning," inevitably bringing harm to others. Thus, they earned the praise of "hoping for it," unaware that this was precisely what our Master Confucius detested. Alas, what a pity!

When Zhao Keguo was in office, the Xianling tribes of the Qiang rebelled. Emperor Xuan sent Bing Ji to ask, "Who can lead the troops?" Keguo replied, "There is no one but this old minister." Bing Ji then asked, "General, how do you assess the Qiang rebels?" He answered, "It is difficult to judge from afar. I wish to go to Jincheng to devise a strategy and present it." Thereupon, a great army was dispatched to Jincheng. Keguo always prioritized distant scouting, ensuring battle readiness when marching and fortifying encampments when halting. He was especially steadfast, cherished his soldiers, and planned thoroughly before engaging in battle. Though the rebels frequently provoked him, he refused to act rashly, seeking instead to use his prestige and trust to persuade Han Kai and those who had been coerced into plunder to surrender. He waited for the rebels' alliances to dissolve and their strength to wane before striking decisively. Xin Wuxian, the Governor of Jiuquan, memorialized that troops should be sent in the seventh month to attack Han Kai. Keguo argued that the Xianling were the primary instigators; if they were eliminated first, the followers of Han Kai would submit without the need for force. An imperial edict approved Keguo’s plan, and Han Kai indeed surrendered without a battle.

The record states: In my humble view, the achievements of the ancients all stemmed from the absolute trust placed in them by their superiors and their own unwavering self-confidence. They often subdued others through prestige and trust, refusing to act lightly—this was the reason. Even with Emperor Xuan’s wisdom and Bing Ji’s loyalty, they still deferred to others’ opinions. When the Emperor asked, "General, how do you assess the Qiang rebels?" that was one moment; when Wuxian memorialized to send troops in the seventh month, that was another. Had Keguo lacked a resolute conviction in his heart, advancing when ordered and halting when commanded, he would have been like a disciple carrying a corpse. For rulers and ministers who do not trust the strategies of their generals but instead weigh them against others’ words—unaware of advantages, indifferent to benefits—they are like teachers carrying a corpse. When both superiors and subordinates act recklessly and neither trusts the other, success is rare. This is a profound warning for later generations.

According to *The Later Han History*: Initially, Li Tong of Nanyang served Liu Yin and was fond of astrology and calendrics. The *Chenji* stated: "The Liu clan will rise again, and the Li clan will assist them." He privately cherished this. When Ban Biao fled to Tianshui to avoid danger, Yin Xun asked him, "In the past, when the Zhou fell, the Warring States contended, and the realm was divided. Only after several generations was it settled. Do you think the strategies of the Vertical and Horizontal Alliances will resurface today? Or will the Mandate pass to one man in succession?" Ban Biao replied, "The rise and fall of the Zhou differ from that of the Han. Formerly, the Zhou enfeoffed five ranks of nobility, and the feudal lords governed themselves. As the root weakened, the branches grew strong, so in the end, the Vertical and Horizontal Alliances arose—this was the natural course of events. The Han inherited the Qin system, establishing commanderies and counties. The ruler held absolute authority, while ministers lacked hereditary power. By the time of Emperor Cheng, who indulged his maternal relatives, the dynasty’s fortunes declined. The imperial line was severed thrice, allowing the Wang clan to usurp the throne and seize power. The crisis originated from above, sparing the common people. Thus, after the restoration, all under heaven stretched their necks in longing. Within a decade, turmoil erupted both within and beyond the court. Distant and near regions rose in rebellion, all claiming the Liu name and speaking with one voice. Now, the heroic leaders controlling the provinces lack the resources of the Seven States of old, yet the people’s sighs and yearning for Han virtue are evident." Yin Xun said, "Your words on the circumstances of the Zhou and Han are apt. But to claim that the Han will rise again merely because foolish people are accustomed to the Liu surname is far-fetched. When the Qin lost the people’s support, Liu Ji rallied them—did the people of that time know of the Han?" Ban Biao then wrote the *On the Mandate of Kings*, arguing that Han virtue inherited Yao’s legacy and bore the signs of a sacred Mandate. The rise of a true king is not achieved by deceit or force. He hoped to move Yin Xun with this.

When the generals urged Emperor Guangwu to ascend the throne, a fellow lodger, Qiang Hua, presented the *Red Symbol of Submission* from Guanzhong, which read: "Liu Xiu raises troops to punish the unrighteous. The Four Barbarians gather like clouds, dragons battle in the wild. At the time of four sevens, fire shall reign." The ministers then memorialized: "The symbols of the Mandate are grand when people respond. Though separated by a thousand miles, their hearts align without dissent. How can the Zhou’s white fish compare? Now, with no Son of Heaven, the realm is in chaos. The responses of auspicious omens are manifest and widely known. We should answer the will of the gods to fulfill the people’s hopes." Thereupon, Emperor Guangwu ordered the officials to prepare an altar, and on the *jiwei* day of the sixth month, he ascended the imperial throne.

The record states: The sayings of *chenji* have long been doubted by former Confucians. As for those who curry favor with the powerful or opportunistically attach themselves to such matters, these are not the discussions of upright men or the earnest admonitions of the sincere. Have they not read Ban Biao’s treatise? He expounded on the Dao and discussed the Mandate, analyzing principles and discerning the times. His words were precise and trustworthy. The Han’s reception of the Mandate is evident here. Had Guangwu not secretly favored Qiang Hua’s words, the founding of the Later Han would have been even more illustrious. What a pity the generals could not do so! Nevertheless, at that time, the Youlai, Dashi, Chimei, and Wuxiao rebels had not yet submitted, while Yin Xun, Gongsun Shu, Dou Rong, and others had not yet pledged allegiance. Without invoking the Mandate of Heaven, how could they win the people’s hearts? The Emperor’s reverence for such omens was a temporary measure to address the exigencies of the moment. Once the realm was pacified, he should have followed King Wu’s example in respectfully receiving the *Red Book* or Ji Zi’s in expounding the *Great Plan*. Who would not call this the grand strategy of an emperor for ten thousand generations?

The pedantic adherence to past precedents—such as sequentially establishing military merit or arbitrarily revising sacrificial rites—is truly misguided. This is precisely what drew Zheng Xing’s censure.

Guo Ji, from youth, possessed noble aspirations and conduct. After returning from a mission to Pingwen, he was summoned to the office of the Grand Minister of Works, then promoted three times to become Prefect of Yuyang. When Emperor Guangwu ascended the throne, Guo was transferred to serve as Grand Administrator of Yuyang. At the time, the region had suffered the chaos of Wang Mang’s usurpation, compounded by the defeat of Peng Chong, leaving the populace rife with cunning and malice, and bandits rampant. Upon his arrival, Guo demonstrated trust in rewards and punishments, executing the ringleaders of the rebels. The bandits dispersed, and over five years in office, the population and households flourished.

Later, when bandits arose in Yingchuan, he was appointed Grand Administrator of Yingchuan. Upon arriving in the commandery, he summoned and pacified hundreds of fugitives, including Zhao Chong and Zhao Hao. Hearing of Guo’s prestige and integrity, their followers—some from as far as the south of the Yangtze, others from You and Ji—came in an unbroken stream to surrender. He was then transferred to serve as Governor of Bingzhou. Guo had previously governed Bingzhou and had long cultivated virtue and favor there. Upon re-entering the province, wherever he went, the elderly and young lined the roads, welcoming him. When he first began his tour of inspection and reached Meixi in Hexi, several hundred children, each riding bamboo horses, came to greet and bow to him along the road. Guo asked the children why they had come from afar. They replied, “We heard Your Excellency was arriving and came joyfully to welcome you.” Guo declined their gesture with thanks. After his duties were complete, the children escorted him beyond the outer walls and asked, “When will Your Excellency return?” Guo calculated the date and told them. When he returned from his tour, he arrived a day early. Fearing he would break his promise to the children, he halted at a wayside pavilion and waited until the appointed day before entering the city.

*Recorded:* How does Guo Xihou’s keeping of his promise to the children compare to Marquis Wen of Wei’s adherence to his appointment with the forester? The forester’s appointment was merely for the pleasure of hunting—whether it rained or not, whether he went or not, mattered little. Yet when the realm had just been pacified and those who usurped names and seized power were beyond counting, relying on one’s own integrity to win over the hearts of the people—if words were spoken and then broken, or matters changed on a whim, even small affairs would falter. How much more so for great matters? How could one demonstrate trustworthiness to others? The *Book of Changes* says: “Going forth without recklessness brings good fortune.” Perhaps this is how Xihou achieved his aims.

Zhang Gang, ranked highly among the imperial censors, was sent by Emperor Ming along with seven other envoys to tour the realm and receive reports from the provinces. Yet Zhang alone buried the wheels of his carriage at the capital’s post station in Luoyang, declaring, “When wolves and jackals block the path, why trouble with foxes?” He then submitted a memorial impeaching the Grand General Liang Ji and the Prefect of the Capital □, listing fifteen instances of their disloyal and unprincely conduct. When the memorial was presented, Liang Ji flew into a rage and sought to punish him by law.

At the time, the bandit Zhang Ying in Guangling had amassed tens of thousands of followers, killing two governors and other high officials. Cao Cao commended his sense of loyalty. Later, when Guan Yu slew Yan Liang, he sent a letter of farewell before fleeing to Liu Bei’s camp among Yuan Shao’s forces. Cao Cao’s advisors urged him to pursue Guan Yu, but Cao said, “Each serves his own lord—do not pursue him.”

*Recorded:* Guan Yu’s slaying of Yan Liang—was this not akin to Zhang Liang’s attempt to assassinate the First Emperor? What a pity there was no one to lend him support or persuade him otherwise. Zhang Liang’s refusal to restore the Six States was like Cao Cao’s capture of Guan Yu and defeat of Liu Bei. Liang’s avenging of Han for his native state was like Guan Yu’s following of Liu Bei to revive the Han house. Yet heroes found no ground for their valor. Though they swore to die together, would their deaths not be in vain? Had Guan Yu, through his own integrity, moved Cao Cao to admiration and joined forces with him to destroy Yuan Shao, then submitted a memorial to welcome Liu Bei, would his merit not have been great? In this way, he could have served both Cao and Liu, achieving a dual success. Yet his mere slaying of Yan Liang was but a trifling deed.

Later, when Cao Cao launched a southern campaign against Liu Biao, Liu Biao died, and his son Zong succeeded him, promptly surrendering the province to Cao. At the time, Liu Bei was stationed in Fancheng. Some advised him to attack Liu Zong, saying Jingzhou could be taken. Liu Bei replied, “Liu Jingzhou entrusted his orphaned heir to me. To betray trust for my own gain is something I will not do.” When he passed through Xiangyang, many people flocked to join him. By the time he reached Dangyang, his followers numbered over a hundred thousand, slowing his march to a mere ten *li* a day. Some urged him to hasten to Jiangling, but Liu Bei said, “In accomplishing great affairs, one must take the people as the foundation. Now that the people have come to me, how can I bear to abandon them?”

Cao Cao, fearing Liu Bei would seize Jiangling, which held military supplies, led his elite troops in a forced march of over three hundred *li* a day, catching up with Liu Bei at Changban in Dangyang. Liu Bei abandoned his wife and children and fled.

Later, when Fa Zheng served as Military Advisor to Liu Zhang, he and the Chief Clerk Zhang Song privately concluded that Liu Zhang was incapable of great deeds. They secretly urged Liu Bei to take Yizhou. Liu Bei hesitated and consulted Pang Tong, who said, “Yizhou is fertile and wealthy, its resources sufficient to support a great enterprise.” Liu Bei replied, “My present adversary, who stands with me like fire and water, is Cao Cao. He acts with urgency, while I act with patience; he is violent, while I am humane; he is deceitful, while I am loyal. In every way, I oppose him, and only thus can success be achieved. Now, to gain a small advantage and lose trust and righteousness before the world—how could I do that?” Pang Tong said, “To seize by force and govern with virtue—this is what the ancients prized. Once affairs are settled, you may enfeoff him with a great state. What breach of trust or loss of righteousness would there be? If you do not take it now, it will ultimately benefit another.” Liu Bei then began to see the wisdom in his words.

Leaving Liu Liang and Guan Yu to guard Jingzhou, he led his infantry into Yizhou.

The *Lu* Record states: Many scholars of former times have debated Emperor Zhaolie’s seizure of Jing and Yi. What principle should we ultimately follow? Confucius said, “The noble person is steadfast but not rigidly bound by small promises.” Mencius said, “When a sister-in-law is drowning, to extend a hand to save her is a matter of *quan* (expediency).” The commentators explain: *Zhen* means steadfastness in what is right and firm, while *liang* refers to petty fidelity. A drowning sister-in-law is a grave matter, while lending a hand is a minor impropriety. Measuring the petty by the standard of what is right allows one to grasp righteousness; weighing the minor against the major allows one to grasp *quan*.

Since the rise of the Two Han, no dynasty has begun without even a foot of land, yet none has known hardship like that of Emperor Zhaolie. Among the contending warlords, none seized and usurped territory as they did in his time. Why was this so? The reason lies in the necessity of possessing a domain when establishing a state. When the Duke of Pei was already King of Han, and Liu Xiu was already Prince of Xiao, these were their rightful lands. Later, having gained Long, they still coveted Shu—how much more so for Liu Bei? One year he fled to Xuzhou, the next he was defeated at Xiapi, gaining not an inch of land. Is this how one who aspires to kingship should act?

As for Liu Biao’s occupation of Jing and Liu Yan’s occupation of Yi, these were not rightful domains but mere usurpations seized in the moment. Moreover, both died without heirs—could their lands truly have remained the spoils of petty villains and cunning usurpers? Yet when Liu Zhang, on his deathbed, entrusted his domain, it was a matter of petty fidelity, not the words of one who discerned the times and was a hero of his age.

Thus, Zhuge Liang first said, “Heaven has placed this in the General’s hands—does the General have the will to take it?” And again, “Yizhou is a land of natural barriers and a celestial repository—can you still fail to understand?” To cling to the minor impropriety of betraying a trust while forgetting the great crisis of the realm—had Liu Bei publicly declared his defiance of his father’s dying command, surrendered his state, and submitted as a captive, no sin of unfiliality could have been greater. How could he have justified himself at the time, or how could later generations have excused him? Moreover, had he not forgotten Liu Zhang’s past generosity in supplying his needs, he would not have reared a tiger and left behind a calamity, nor would he have faced accusations of seizing another’s throat and striking his back. A moment’s failure to perceive the opportune moment led, in the end, to his inability to avoid taking Yi.

Thus, Master Zhu said, “Both the constant principle and expedience were lost.” This is precisely the case.

*Hongdao Lu*, Scroll 48 (conclusion)
*Hongdao Lu*, Scroll 49: *Trust—The Trust Between Ruler and Minister*

From the *Book of Jin*: When Yang Hu was stationed in Xiangyang, he soothed and pacified both near and far, winning the hearts of the people along the Jiang and Han rivers. He established profound trust with the people of Wu, and if any who had surrendered later wished to leave, he allowed them to do so. In camp, he often wore light furs and loose sashes, never donning armor, and in his command pavilion, no more than ten or so guards attended him. He devoted himself to winning over Wu through virtue and trust. Whenever battles were fought, even when the hour was set for combat, he refused to employ ambushes or surprise attacks. If any of his generals or commanders proposed cunning strategies, he would ply them with fine wine until they could no longer speak. When his troops ventured into Wu territory and reaped grain for provisions, they always calculated the amount taken and sent silk in compensation. Whenever his forces hunted along the Jiang and Mian rivers, if they captured game that had already been wounded by the people of Wu, they would return it. Thus, the borderland people were pleased and submitted. His counterpart in Wu, Generalissimo Lu Kang, held the opposite bank, and their envoys frequently exchanged messages. Once, Lu Kang sent Yang Hu a cask of wine, which Yang drank without suspicion. When Lu Kang fell ill and requested medicine, Yang Hu sent him a prepared remedy, which Lu Kang immediately consumed. Many advised Lu Kang against this, but he replied, “How could Yang Shuzi ever poison anyone?” He often instructed his border garrisons: “They rely solely on virtue, while we rely solely on force—this means they will submit without a fight. We need only guard our borders and refrain from seeking petty gains.”

The record states: The governance of the Duke of Shao beneath the sweet pear tree—is it the same as, or different from, Yang Hu’s weeping at Xianshan? For even a gentleman of discernment cannot always illuminate the hidden with clarity. After Jin destroyed Shu, it never forgot Wu for a single day, as Zhang Ti observed: “Their success is our peril.” How could Wu have been so deceived? The examples of Chen Ping’s generous bestowals and Lü Meng’s displays of trust should have served as warnings. The people of Wu ought to have been tending their firewood and tasting gall, donning armor and resting on spears, to preserve their ancestral legacy—yet they had no time for such vigilance. Instead, they declared, “They rely solely on virtue, while we rely solely on force,” unaware that they were already trapped in their own defenses. Alas! Force is untenable, but was their virtue genuine? The intoxication from fine wine had not yet worn off, yet plans to conquer Wu were repeatedly proposed. It was said, “If Wu installs a worthy ruler, it will be difficult to subdue.” Ah! Was this truly virtue? Was it trust? It was nothing more than a strategist’s ruse to disrupt the enemy’s resolve. Yet compared to those who merely erect wooden tablets to feign trust, leaving only devastation in their wake, there is still cause for inquiry. Had it not been for Yang Hu, Du Yu’s achievements would not have been realized. Yang Hu—was he not a hero of his age?

The *Old唐书*’s “Treatise on Penal Law” records: Emperor Taizong personally reviewed the prisoners sentenced to death. Moved by their plight, he released them to return home, ordering them to come back in autumn to face execution. He then decreed that all death-row prisoners in the realm be similarly released, with the stipulation that they present themselves in the capital by the appointed time. The following September, the three hundred and ninety prisoners released the previous year all returned to the imperial court as promised, without a single one fleeing or hiding. The emperor then pardoned them all.

The record states: The *Yi*’s *Wuwang* hexagram states, “The remedy of the unwavering must not be tested.” The Sage’s intent was that a ruler governing the realm should do so with utmost impartiality and absolute integrity, guiding with perfect sincerity and utmost trust. If one harbors deceitful intentions, employs cunning and deception, seeks fortuitous gains by chance, or forces outcomes through artifice—even a momentary trial is impermissible, let alone sustained use. Emperor Taizong of Tang rose to power by his father’s rebellion, wielding the blade against his kin, slaughtering many innocents. The wrongful deaths of Lu Zushang and Zhang Yungu were especially lamentable. Yet he released prisoners only to pardon them—if even release was improper, how much more so the pardon? This treated human lives as child’s play and the legal code as a toy, merely providing a spectacle for posterity. For death is what people most dread and fear.

If survival may be sought by any means, what extremes would one not resort to? How can one be certain that those who turn themselves in are not impostors sent in their stead? The Emperor was bold in pursuing reputation yet obstinate in self-righteousness. In the court’s deliberations, how many more like Yungu were there—substituting falsehood for truth, pretense for sincerity, playacting for law, and death for life? Even a hundred releases would be of no avail.

Wei Zheng submitted a memorial, citing the words of Wenzi: “When words are the same and yet trusted, trust precedes the words; when commands are the same and yet obeyed, sincerity lies beyond the commands.” Though the imperial Dao had been resplendent for over a decade, the transformative power of virtue had not yet permeated all, for the emperor’s treatment of his ministers lacked perfect sincerity and trust. Now, in establishing governance and achieving order, one must entrust matters to the noble-minded. Yet in matters of success or failure, one might consult the petty-minded. The noble-minded are treated with respect but kept at a distance; the petty-minded are treated lightly but drawn close. Familiarity breeds unrestrained speech, while distance prevents true sentiments from reaching above. Even those of middling intelligence may possess small cunning, yet their talents are unsuited to governing the state, and their foresight does not extend far. Though they may exhaust their strength and sincerity, failure is still inevitable—how much worse when they harbor deceit? The depth of the ensuing disaster would be profound.

Even the noble-minded may commit minor faults, yet these do not harm the upright Dao—such lapses may be overlooked. But if one calls them noble-minded yet still doubts their trustworthiness, how is this different from gazing at a straight tree and suspecting its shadow is crooked? If Your Majesty carefully selects the noble-minded and employs them with ritual propriety and trust, what cause is there for concern over governance? Otherwise, the hour of peril and ruin cannot be assured.

The Emperor bestowed a handwritten edict in praise, saying: “After Jin Wu conquered the realm, his will grew arrogant and indolent. He Chong, though holding the highest office, dared not offer forthright remonstrance. Instead, he privately boasted of his wisdom to his descendants—this was the height of disloyalty. Receiving your admonition, I recognize my error. I shall place it upon my desk, comparing it to the leather and bowstring.” The record notes: The Emperor likening Zheng’s memorial to the leather and bowstring was apt. Yet did he not realize that the leather’s suppleness and the bowstring’s straightness arise naturally from their inherent qualities—or must they be forcibly shaped? In this, Zheng’s memorial was not entirely exhaustive. For when the shadow is straight, the object itself is upright; when the source is pure, the stream flows clear. If the ruler’s heart is wholly sincere and trustworthy, transformation occurs without words, and commands are obeyed without decree—why then would the treatment of ministers lack perfect sincerity? If this were not so, one might today call them noble-minded, only to deem them petty-minded tomorrow. That Taizong’s era did not attain the purity of the Three Dynasties, with the noble-minded and petty-minded in constant flux, was entirely due to the ruler’s heart not being wholly sincere and trustworthy. Zheng knew to observe the shadow yet did not seek the straight tree; he compared himself to the leather and bowstring yet failed to grasp the essence of their natural straightness and suppleness—what difference was there?

The Emperor said to Wang Gui: “Your discernment is keen and your understanding profound, and you excel in discourse. Among those like Fang Xuanling and the others, you should assess them all. How do you compare to these men?” Wang Gui replied: “In diligent service to the state, knowing no bounds in action, I am not the equal of Fang Xuanling. In talent encompassing both civil and martial arts, serving as both general and minister, I am not the equal of Li Jing. In presenting memorials with clarity and precision, ensuring all responses are fitting, I am not the equal of Wen Yanbo. In managing complex and demanding affairs, ensuring all tasks are completed, I am not the equal of Dai Zhou. In feeling shame that the ruler does not match Yao and Shun, and taking remonstrance as my duty, I am not the equal of Wei Zheng. However, in exposing corruption and extolling purity, detesting evil and cherishing goodness, I possess a slight superiority over these men.” The Emperor affirmed this, and the court acknowledged the accuracy of his assessment.

The record notes: In the era of a wise ruler, all submit to righteousness, and judgments may be tested. In a mediocre and benighted court, right and wrong are confused, and baseless opinions surge. At that time, ruler and ministers were in perfect accord, like limbs and vital organs—supporting one another in conduct, aiding one another in action, and thus applying this to all they saw and heard. How could anything fail to be genuine?

Empress Wu held Di Renjie in the highest esteem, surpassing all other ministers, and often addressed him as “National Elder” without using his name. Renjie frequently engaged in direct remonstrance in court, and the Empress often yielded to his counsel. Once, she asked: “I wish to appoint an outstanding official—who would be suitable?” He replied: “If you seek one learned and refined, then Su Weidao and Li Jiaogu are fitting choices. If you desire one of exceptional and extraordinary talent, then Zhang Jianzhi, the Prefect of Yuezhou, is your man. Though he is advanced in years, he possesses the qualities of a prime minister.” The Empress promoted him to Controller of Luozhou. Some days later, she asked again. Renjie replied: “I previously recommended Jianzhi, yet he has not been appointed.” The Empress said: “I have already promoted him.” Renjie responded: “The one I recommended is fit for prime minister, not Controller.” She then appointed him Vice Minister of Justice, and he was eventually made prime minister. Renjie also recommended dozens of others, including Vice Minister of War Yao Yuanchong, Investigating Censor Huan Yanfan, and Prefect of Daizhou Jing Hui, all of whom became renowned ministers. Someone remarked to him: “All the peaches and plums of the realm are in your courtyard.” Renjie replied: “Recommending the worthy is for the state, not for myself.”

The record notes: The peaches and plums of Di’s courtyard were the radiance of all things. The peaches and plums of later ages were but the fleeting brilliance of spring’s breeze. Observing those he recommended, his merit in fostering worthiness is truly worthy of esteem.

Zhang Jiuling, noting Yao Yuanchong’s esteemed reputation and the Emperor’s trust in him, sent a letter advising him to distance himself from flatterers and the restless, and to advance the pure and sincere. Yuanchong praised and accepted his counsel. One day, he requested the promotion of certain officials. The Emperor looked up at the palace ceiling and spoke repeatedly, yet gave no response. Yuanchong grew fearful and hurried out. After the court session, Gao Lishi admonished: “Your Majesty has newly assumed the reins of governance. When the prime minister presents matters, you should respond directly—why remain so inattentive?”

The Emperor said: “I have entrusted Yuanchong with the administration of all government affairs. Matters of great import should be reported to me, but petty officials of the sixth rank—must he trouble me with every single one?” It so happened that Gao Lishi came to the ministry to deliver an imperial message, and he relayed the Emperor’s words. Yuanchong was pleased, and all who heard marveled at the Emperor’s discernment in judging the qualities of a ruler.

The chronicler notes: This was the beginning of the influence of Li Linfu and Yang Guozhong. The heart of the noble man is virtuous: he defers to his sovereign, ever fearful that authority might slip from the throne into his own hands. The heart of the petty man is deceitful: he indulges his whims before the multitude, ever fearful that authority might remain firmly in the hands of the ruler. Though the rank of these officials was low, were they not like the constellations in the heavens? To find them a burden was one thing for Yuanchong, but for others, it would not have been so. Moreover, Yuanchong had thrice failed to report his decisions, yet a single word from Gao Lishi echoed like thunder, turning the public discourse of the court into private whispers within the ministry. How could one hope to prevent the usurpation of power under such circumstances? A single moment of silence or speech was enough to foretell that his end would not be good. Those who rule must be vigilant.

Zhang Shougui sent An Lushan to campaign against the Xi and the Khitan. Relying on his bravery, Lushan advanced recklessly and was defeated by the enemy. Shougui memorialized the throne requesting his execution. As Lushan stood before the executioner, he cried out: “Does the General not wish to destroy the Xi and the Khitan? Why kill me?” Shougui, valuing his courage, wished to spare him and instead sent him under guard to the capital. Zhang Jiuling memorialized: “In ancient times, Rangju executed Zhuang Jia, and Sun Wu beheaded the palace ladies. If Shougui’s military discipline had been enforced, Lushan should not have escaped death.” The Emperor, pitying his talent, issued an edict sparing his life, ordering him to serve as a general in commoner’s garb. Jiuling firmly remonstrated: “Lushan violated military discipline and lost his army; by law, he cannot be spared. Furthermore, I observe his countenance—it bears the signs of rebellion. If he is not put to death, he will surely become a future calamity.” The Emperor replied: “Do not, like Wang Yifu who recognized Shi Le, wrongly harm a loyal subject.” In the end, he pardoned Lushan.

The chronicler notes: The Emperor’s words are perplexing. If Wang Yan had truly known Shi Le, then Jiuling’s warning was nothing extraordinary. But if Wang Yan did not know Shi Le, then the wrong done to Lushan remains doubtful. For if he had recognized Shi Le, why then speak of wrongly harming a loyal subject? At that time, the cosmos had already shifted, and hardship was imminent. Heaven had deprived the Emperor of his wisdom, blinding his heart and will. If one so lacking in benevolence could still be reasoned with, how could there be the ruin of nations and the downfall of houses? Otherwise, how could he have failed to recognize not only Lushan but also Shi Siming? Even if his judgment was clouded, such confusion was inexcusable.

In the second year of the Zhide era of Emperor Suzong, the retired Emperor longed for Zhang Jiuling’s foresight and wept for him. He dispatched an emissary to Qujiang to offer sacrifices and generously provided for Jiuling’s family.

The chronicler notes: Jiuling’s words before and after were as clear as divination by tortoise shell or milfoil. Yet the Emperor not only failed to heed them but even doubted them. Thus, the sword of Li Linfu was not wielded by himself—it was the Emperor who wielded it. The sweetness of honeyed words was not tasted by himself—it was the Emperor who tasted it. Though the deception of petty men is evident in the moment, the trust earned by noble men often comes only after their deaths. The momentary is like the stench of rotting flesh, so foul that even then men cover their noses; the posthumous is like medicine and acupuncture, striking a chord with all ages. Was this not why, even beyond the tears shed in Shu, the legacy of Qujiang’s integrity endures to this day?

In the first year of the Yongtai era of Emperor Daizong, the armies of the Uyghurs and the Tubo besieged Jingyang. At that time, Pugu Huai’en had died, and the two barbarian forces, vying for supremacy, were at odds. They divided their camps, with the Uyghurs stationed to the west of the city. Guo Ziyi sent his adjutant Li Yuanzan to negotiate with them, proposing a joint attack on the Tubo. The Uyghurs did not believe him, saying: “Where is Lord Guo? You are deceiving us. If he is truly here, can we see him?” Yuanzan returned and reported this. Ziyi said: “Our forces are outnumbered, and victory by strength is unlikely. It would be better for me to go forth alone and persuade them. We may subdue them without battle.” He then opened the city gates and rode out with a few horsemen, sending a messenger ahead to announce: “The Duke of Ying is coming.” The Uyghurs were astonished. Their great chieftain, Yüge Luo—a younger brother of the Khagan—stood at the front of the ranks, bow drawn and arrow nocked. Ziyi removed his helmet, doffed his armor, cast aside his spear, and advanced. The tribal leaders looked at one another and said: “It is he.” They all dismounted and prostrated themselves. Ziyi also dismounted, took Yüge Luo’s hand, and reproached him: “The Uyghurs have rendered great service to the Tang, and the Tang’s repayment has not been meager. Why have you broken your oath, deeply invading our land, forsaking past merit, and sowing enmity? How foolish! Moreover, Huai’en betrayed his lord and abandoned his mother—what concern is that to your nation? Today, I have come alone. If you wish to kill me, my officers and soldiers will surely fight to the death against you.”

Yüge Luo said: "Huai’en deceived us, claiming that the Heavenly Khagan had passed away, that you, my lord, had also perished, and that the Central Kingdom had no ruler. That is why we dared to come with him. Now we know the Heavenly Khagan resides in the Upper Capital, that you, my lord, have once again taken command of the armies, and that Huai’en has been slain by Heaven—how could we possibly fight against you?"

Ziyi then persuaded him, saying: "The Tubo are without the Dao. Taking advantage of our nation’s turmoil, they disregarded the bond of uncle and nephew, devoured our borderlands, and burned and ravaged our capital districts. The wealth they have plundered is beyond measure—this is what Heaven has bestowed upon you."

Yüge Luo replied: "I was misled by Huai’en and have deeply wronged you, my lord. Now I shall exert all my strength to strike the Tubo in your service and atone for my error."

The Uyghur onlookers gradually advanced, and Ziyi’s troops also moved forward. He waved his hand to hold them back, then took wine and drank with Yüge Luo, presenting him with three thousand bolts of silk. In the end, they sealed the pact and withdrew.

Upon hearing this, the Tubo fled under cover of night. Yüge Luo led his forces in pursuit, while Ziyi dispatched Bai Yuan’guang with elite cavalry to join them. They engaged the enemy at Xiyuan west of Lingtai and crushed them.

**Record states:** Observing Ziyi’s conduct in this affair, it was not merely his sincerity and trustworthiness that brought about such an outcome. One can see how his qi swallowed both Hua and Yi, his capacity embraced all within the Four Seas—this was no petty display of removing his helmet before barbarians.

When Han Yu was Prefect of Chaozhou, he inquired about the people’s hardships. They all said: "In the waters of the Jiao River, there are crocodiles several *zhang* in length that devour our livestock, leaving almost none to breed." After a few days, Han Yu went to inspect the site. He cast a piglet and a sheep into the water and composed a proclamation, ordering the crocodiles to move south into the sea within three days. If they could not do so in three days, then five; if not in five, then seven. If they still refused to leave, it would be clear they had no intention of doing so. The prefect would then select strong men armed with sturdy crossbows and poisoned arrows to engage the crocodiles.

That very night, a violent storm arose with thunder, and the waters of the pool dried up within days. The crocodiles relocated sixty *li* west of their former haunt, and from then on, Chaozhou was free of their menace. Han Yu was later transferred to the post of Vice Minister of War.

When rebellion broke out in Zhenzhou and Tian Hongzheng was killed, with Wang Tingcou installed in his place, an imperial edict ordered Han Yu to pacify the region. As he set out, all feared for his safety. Upon arrival, Tingcou surrounded him with heavily armed troops. Han Yu shouted: "The Son of Heaven appointed you as a general and bestowed upon you the staff of office—how could you turn against him and side with rebels?"

Before he could finish, a soldier stepped forward and cried: "Our late Grand Preceptor fought for the state, and the bloodstained robes of Zhu Tao still remain—what wrong has this army committed to be branded as rebels?"

Han Yu replied: "I thought you had forgotten your late Grand Preceptor. If you still remember him, that is well. Since the Tianbao era, have any sons or grandsons of An Lushan, Shi Siming, or Li Xilie remained? Are any of them still in office?"

The crowd answered: "None."

Han Yu continued: "Tian Hongzheng returned the six prefectures of Weibo to the court, was appointed Chancellor, and both he and his son received the imperial staff. Liu Wu and Li You were also granted great commands—these are matters your army knows well."

The crowd said: "Hongzheng was harsh, which is why this army was unsettled."

Han Yu replied: "Even so, you murdered Tian Hongzheng and slaughtered his family—what justification can there be?"

The assembly fell silent, then murmured: "Well said."

Then Ting Geng said: "Now what would you have me do?"

Han Yu replied: "Commanders of the Divine Strategy’s Six Armies, such as Niu Yuanwei, have done no wrong. Yet the court, considering the greater peace, cannot abandon them. Why then have you long besieged him?"

Ting Ling said: "I shall let him go."

Han Yu said: "If so, then there is no further trouble."

Just then, Yuanwei also broke through the siege and escaped, and Ting Ling did not pursue. Han Yu returned and reported their exchange, and the Emperor was greatly pleased.

The record states: *The* Yi *says in* Zhong Fu*:* "Trust extends even to pigs and fish." It also says: "It is beneficial to cross great rivers, for thus the state is transformed." Now fish are creatures of stillness, without awareness, yet trust can move them—what matter cannot be accomplished, what thing cannot be transformed? One may tread through water and fire, or face the unfathomable, and still succeed. Hence it is said: "It is beneficial to cross great rivers." At that time, though Ting Ling was violent and lawless, he was, after all, only a man. By Han Yu’s loyalty and sincerity, he was able to subdue his heart, so that Ting Ling readily obeyed—there was no other way. Thus it is also said: "Thus the state is transformed." Can men not strive to emulate this?

Yet Su Shi once said: "Your utmost sincerity could part the clouds of Mount Heng, yet could not dispel Emperor Xianzong’s delusions; it could tame the savagery of crocodiles, yet could not silence the slander of Huangfu Bo and Li Fengji; it could earn the unwavering trust of the people of Nanhai, so that you are worshipped in temples to this day, yet could not secure you a single day’s peace at court." For what you could accomplish was ordained by Heaven, while what you could not was the work of men. His words are thorough, and so I record them here.

*The History of the Song* states: Emperor Taizu asked Zhao Pu: "Since the end of the Five Dynasties, in just a few decades, there have been eight ruling houses and twelve emperors, each usurping the throne in turn, locked in endless war, with the people suffering terribly. What is the reason for this? I wish to end the wars of the realm and establish a lasting foundation for the state. How may this be done?"

Zhao Pu replied: "That Your Majesty should speak of this is a blessing for Heaven, Earth, man, and the spirits. There is no other reason: the regional commanders grew too powerful, and the sovereign weak while his ministers grew strong. To remedy this, one must gradually strip them of their authority, control their finances and grain, and reclaim their elite troops. Then the realm will naturally be at peace."

At the time, Shi Shouxin, Wang Shenqi, and others were the Emperor’s old comrades, men of merit who commanded the imperial guard. One evening after court, the Emperor invited them to drink, and when they were merry, he dismissed his attendants and said: "Without you, I would not have attained this position. Yet being emperor is far more difficult than being a regional commander—indeed, I have not slept soundly a single night. Who in this position would not desire it?" Shouxin and the others bowed their heads and said: "Why does Your Majesty speak thus? Heaven’s mandate is now settled; who would dare harbor other thoughts?"

The Emperor said: "That may be so. But what of your subordinates? If they seek wealth and rank, what then?"

Shouxin and the others wept and said: "We are fools, unworthy of Your Majesty’s wisdom. Pray, show us the path to life."

The Emperor said: "Man’s life is fleeting as a white colt glimpsed through a crack in the wall. Those who covet wealth and rank do so only to amass gold and silver, to indulge themselves and their pleasures, and to ensure their descendants want for nothing. Why not relinquish your military commands, take up governorships in the great provinces, and purchase fine estates and houses to secure an unshakable inheritance for your children? Buy singing girls and dancers, feast and revel day and night, and live out your years in joy. I shall form marriage alliances with you, and between sovereign and ministers, there will be no suspicion—would this not be good?"

Shouxin and the others all thanked him, saying: "That Your Majesty should think of us thus is as if you had given us life from death, bone from flesh." The next day, they all claimed illness and begged to be relieved of their military posts.

The record states: The events at Chen Bridge arose suddenly, following the old ways of the Five Dynasties. The relinquishing of military power nipped trouble in the bud, and this became the unshakable foundation of the Great Song. *The* Yi *says:* "In danger, one raises the alarm in the royal court; trust is proclaimed, and there is peril." The *Image* says: "Raising the alarm in the royal court—this is the yielding riding upon the five strong. Trust is proclaimed, and there is peril—thus danger is transformed into radiance." When the disorder of petty men reaches its limit, the cycle of decline and renewal ensures that Heaven raises up a sovereign of great ability, aided by ministers of integrity, clarity, and resolve. The power of the Dao flourishes, and the weak and yielding are vanquished. Thus he could act openly at court, making clear to all the principles of advancement and retreat, the subtleties of action and inaction. His utmost sincerity and trust were not born of deceit or reliance on force, nor was his grand proclamation the work of secret schemes. This is what sets him apart from those who seize power by stealth or cunning, who are ultimately overthrown and destroyed. Was this not the foundation of the Song’s enduring governance, surpassing that of the Han and Tang?

When Zhao Pu was Chancellor, he took the realm as his own responsibility. Emperor Taizu entrusted him with all matters, great and small, seeking his counsel on every decision. Once, he recommended a man for office, but the Emperor refused. The next day, he submitted the recommendation again, and again it was refused. He then brought the man to court himself, and the Emperor, enraged, tore the memorial to pieces and cast it to the ground. Zhao Pu’s expression did not change; he knelt and gathered the fragments. Later, he pieced the memorial back together and resubmitted it as before. The Emperor then understood and ultimately appointed the man. On another occasion, a minor official was due for promotion, but the Emperor, who had long disliked the man, refused to advance him. Zhao Pu insisted, and the Emperor grew angry, saying: "I have decided he shall not be promoted. What can you do about it?"

Zhao Pu replied: "Punishment is for deterring evil, reward for recognizing merit—this is the universal principle of past and present. Moreover, punishment and reward belong to the realm, not to Your Majesty alone. How can you wield them at the whim of your likes and dislikes?" The Emperor was furious and rose to return to the palace, but Zhao Pu followed him and would not leave. After a long while, the Emperor finally granted his request. His resolute integrity and steadfast sincerity were ever thus.

The record states: The piecing together of the torn memorial—this was an act of a flourishing age.

Zhao Pu may truly be said to have borne no fault in recommending the worthy. Yet why, when it came to the memorial he had signed at the imperial couch, could he bring himself to tear it apart? At that time, when the Grand Progenitor held the Mandate of Heaven, Pu took the altars of state as his own responsibility; his private desires had not yet stirred, nor had considerations of gain and loss arisen, and so he was able to devote himself wholly to the service of his lord. But after he was reappointed as chief minister, his private desires had already stirred, and considerations of gain and loss had already arisen, so that he could not but weigh promotion and demotion with favor and disfavor.

Nevertheless, if one were to observe him as others do—merely following the dictates of personal likes and dislikes, never daring to dissent—how could there have been repeated remonstrations or the piecing together of torn memorials? In Pu’s case, it was not that he was able to enlighten the Emperor, but rather that the Emperor was able to enlighten him.

When King Shupu of Wuyue heard of the fall of Tang, he grew fearful and came to court with his wife, Lady Sun, his son Weijun, and his grandson Chengyou. The Grand Ancestor bestowed upon him a residence befitting a worthy and personally attended a banquet in his honor, trusting him without suspicion. After two months, he sent them back, presenting them with a yellow-wrapped bundle, its seals tightly affixed. He admonished them, saying, "Observe carefully along the way." When they opened it, they found it filled with memorials from the court ministers begging to detain Shupu. Shupu was all the more awestruck and fearful. Upon returning to his duties, he ordered his seat moved to the eastern side, saying, "The northwest is where the divine capital lies. The Emperor trusts me—how dare I not show reverence?" With every tribute he sent, he would first arrange it in the courtyard, burn incense, and only then dispatch it.

The record states: The Emperor’s restoration of Shupu was perhaps a lesson drawn from Li Xuan’s criticism of Li Yu. If others’ snoring slumber could not be tolerated, yet one’s own solitary wakefulness could not be trusted, this would only confuse the bond between ruler and minister and fail to establish a clear and far-reaching vision. Had there been another like Li Xuan, the Emperor’s words would have faltered. By demonstrating such trust, he ensured that in later days, even if Shupu were detained and not sent back, the depth of the two emperors’ magnanimity and the weight of their virtue would have been all the more evident.

When Minister Wang Wenzheng served as chief minister, the Emperor grew ever more trusting, following his counsel without exception. For nearly every memorial or request from high officials, he would first ask Wang, "What do you think of this?" before acting. Wang Wenzheng scrupulously upheld the laws and institutions of the ancestral founders, making no changes. He frequently inquired into the benefits and harms of the realm, sometimes sending envoys to gather opinions and present them. Observing the strengths of various talents, he secretly recorded their names without summoning them again. When making appointments, he would first submit three names and ask the Emperor to select one. The Emperor would mark his choice with a brush, and none of the other ministers knew of it. Thus, whenever Wang Wenzheng made a recommendation, it was invariably approved.

The record states: Did Emperor Zhenzong truly trust Wang Dan with sincerity and the straight path of virtue? At first, he flattered him to secure his loyalty; in the end, he trusted him to fulfill his ambitions. Had Wang Dan not borne the Emperor’s deceit, how could the Emperor have trusted Wang Dan’s words? One may say he was close and discreet, but to call him scrupulous in upholding the law would be inaccurate. For scrupulousness is the duty of an official, requiring unwavering diligence from beginning to end, without the slightest negligence—how could it lead to regret at the brink of crisis? Let the reader silently take note of this.

In *Records of Illustrious Ministers*: When Minister Zhang Zhongding governed Shu before and after, he did so with benevolence and trust. The people rejoiced as if children long separated from their parents had been reunited. Upon his arrival, he replaced severity with leniency, and every decree he issued brought comfort to the people. Shu was thus greatly pacified. The Emperor said, "With Yong in Shu, I no longer have any concerns about the west." Such was the extent of his trust.

Once, he asked Li Tian, "Do the common people truly trust me?" Li replied, "Your Excellency’s authority and kindness have reached the people—how could they not trust you?" The minister said, "In my previous term, that was not yet the case. This time, it should be somewhat better. It took five years to achieve even this single word: *trust*." He also said, "If you govern in the future, first ensure that trust reaches the people, then instruct them. Speak to them of righteousness, then encourage them. Act with propriety, then transform them. Remain impartial and selfless, then the people will be at peace and content in their livelihoods. If these four principles are in place, first set the example yourself."

Minister Wang Yigong once said, "In a person’s conduct, nothing surpasses sincerity and integrity, which remain constant in both safety and peril." When he governed Daming for a second term, his trustworthiness deepened among the people. Civilians and soldiers alike painted his portrait to honor him. When envoys from the northern tribes passed through his jurisdiction, they would say, "The Lord Wang is here," and would bathe and dress in clean robes before entering.

Minister Du Qigong was upright and forthright throughout his life, earning the trust of the realm through his loyalty and sincerity. He once said, "I have served for many years, long in office, known by the Emperor above and trusted by the court and the people below. Thus, I have been able to fulfill my aspirations in most matters." He also said, "From my time in the provincial administration to my tenure as a regional inspector, people did not yet trust me. But when I became Vice Minister of Finance and repeatedly argued my case before the Emperor without wavering, people began to trust me." Moreover, in his dealings with others, he delighted in their goodness. Once he knew someone, he harbored not the slightest doubt. When Qi began as Vice Minister of Military Affairs and debated one or two matters with him, the minister was displeased. Later, whenever Qi discussed affairs, the minister would ask, "Has the Remonstrator reviewed this?" If he had, he would bring it for Qi to sign. Qi thus devoted himself wholeheartedly, never daring to be negligent. From this, one can see how rare it is for a person to trust himself and others as he did.

The record states: These three ministers were the pillars of the state and the cornerstones of their time. Their self-trust and trust in the people—whether toward the ruler above or their peers—were not easily matched. If so, how can a gentleman not strive ever harder? Strive ever harder!

*Hongdao Record*, Scroll Forty-Nine—End.

**Hongdao Record, Scroll Fifty**

**On Trust**
**Trust Between Ruler and Minister**

Emperor Renzong trusted his great ministers. When selecting an envoy to the Khitan, Lü Yijian recommended Fu Bi. At the time, the emperor entrusted the chief ministers with the governance of the realm, assigning Fu Bi to manage northern affairs and Fan Zhongyan to oversee western matters.

Upon his audience, Fu Bi declared: “When the ruler is troubled, his ministers are shamed. I dare not spare my life.” The emperor was visibly moved. He promoted Fu Bi to *Direct Academician of the Bureau of Military Affairs*, but Fu Bi firmly declined, saying: “When the state faces crisis, one cannot shrink from toil. How could I accept office and rank as a bribe?” He then departed.

The record states: Histories claim the emperor lacked firm resolve—how could this be so? By entrusting governance to his chief ministers, northern affairs to Fu Bi, and western matters to Fan Zhongyan, his decisiveness was more than sufficient. In an age governed by the Dao, matters generally proceed thus. Yet when such an age declines, suspicion and mistrust arise, doubts multiply. Tracing the cause, it lies precisely in the abundance of those who cling to salary and the scarcity of those who serve the state as a loyal hound. The worthy and the unworthy become indistinguishable, leading to the ruler’s wavering resolve. Thus, Fu Bi’s refusal of office was not without reason.

Upon arriving in Khitan, Fu Bi met with its ruler and asked: “Our two courts have maintained good relations for nearly forty years. Why now demand the cession of land?” The ruler replied: “The Southern Court has violated the treaty—blocking the *Daomen* Pass, raising embankments, repairing fortifications, and conscripting militia. What is the meaning of this?” Fu Bi answered: “The *Mingmen* Pass was sealed to guard against Yuanhao. The embankments began with He Chengju, a measure in place since the establishment of friendly relations. The fortifications were merely restored from old structures, and the militia were raised to fill vacancies—none of this violates the treaty.”

He then pressed further: “Has the Northern Court forgotten the great virtue of Emperor Zhangsheng? During the *Chanyuan* campaign, had he heeded his generals, not a single northern soldier would have escaped. Moreover, in peacetime, the ruler alone reaps the benefits. In war, the gains flow to his ministers, while the ruler bears the calamity. Thus, those who advocate war do so only for their own gain.” The ruler exclaimed in surprise: “What do you mean?” Fu Bi replied...

“In former times, the Jin High Ancestor deceived Heaven and betrayed his lord, while the Last Emperor was muddled and chaotic, so that superiors and subordinates fell into mutual estrangement—hence the Khitan army prevailed. Yet even then, half their stalwart warriors and sturdy steeds perished. Today, China’s troops are well-trained, her horses strong, her laws and commands clear, and her people of one heart. If war is truly willed, can victory be assured? Even if victory comes, who bears the loss of men and horses—the ministers, or the ruler? If friendly relations endure unbroken, the annual tribute flows entirely to the ruler; what profit do his ministers gain?”

The ruler was deeply enlightened, nodding for a long while, and said: “Without your words, I would not have known these details.”

It is recorded: When the Khitan first sent envoys in return, none dared readily go. Though Lord Zheng resolutely requested the mission, and Lord Ouyang submitted a memorial to detain him, was this not because the task was supremely difficult? Yet when Lord Zheng arrived, the barbarians found nothing to fear. Though he spoke back and forth for hundreds of words, they never once pressed him with a challenge—where, then, was the difficulty? The difficulty lay not in the barbarians, but in trust and righteousness. What China relies upon are only trust and righteousness, by which the hearts of the barbarians may be subdued. If these are weighed in the balance of strength and the scales of victory and defeat, it is not for the gentleman to presume to know.

Yet now, among the Tatars, are there truly none with the slightest human heart? Or have they been deceived by false trust and hollow alliances? If one were to open sincerity and lay bare the public good, enticing them with considerations of profit and harm, clarifying honor and disgrace, even if they could not be made entirely compliant, they would not have turned so perverse. Then why should those who govern the state shrink from such action?

Fu Bi again went to the Khitan, addressing only two matters: alliance by marriage and increased tribute. When the oath document arrived, they no longer discussed marriage, but insisted solely on increased tribute, saying: “Since the Southern Court has increased our annual tribute, the wording should read ‘presented.’” Fu Bi replied: “The Southern Court is the elder brother; how can an elder brother present to a younger?” They then proposed the word “delivered.” Fu Bi again refused, saying: “Since the Southern Court has bestowed such generous tribute upon us, it is because we are feared. What weight do two characters carry?” Fu Bi said: “Our court cherishes both north and south alike, and thus does not shrink from renewing the accord. How can this be called fear? If compelled, then in matters of war, victory and defeat should be determined by right and wrong—not for an envoy to know.”

The Khitan ruler said: “There are precedents for this.” Fu Bi replied: “Since antiquity, only the Tang High Ancestor borrowed troops from the Türks. At the time, it may have been called ‘presentation,’ but later, when Illig was captured by Taizong, did such a thing recur?” His tone and expression grew stern. The ruler, knowing his resolve could not be shaken, said: “I shall send my own envoy to discuss this.”

It is recorded: The oath document of Jingde was one; the oath documents of Qingli were two. The peace of Jingde was near; the peace of Qingli was distant. In the era of the fallen Yan and extinguished Zong, China was in no way comparable to Han in strategy, to Tang in planning, to Qin in strength, or to Sui in wealth. She relied solely on Fu Bi’s sincerity and persuasive contention. The two characters of “presentation” and “delivery” in the exchange between Hua and Yi are worth observing.

Yet with the emperor’s humility and brilliance, contending over the word “delivered” was not excessive; with his frugality, increasing the annual tribute was not extravagance; with his innate sevenfold love, ceasing hostilities was not empty rhetoric. Otherwise, the words received in audience might differ from those spoken at departure—how much more so the brush of later historians? This, too, must not be overlooked.

At that time, as military campaigns raged along the western frontier and defenses proved inadequate, **Zhong Shiheng** proposed: "East of Yan’an lies the abandoned fortress of the former Kuanzhou, which should be rebuilt to block the enemy’s main route. To the right, it would secure Yan’an’s position; to the left, it would facilitate the transport of grain from the east of the Yellow River; to the north, it would allow for the recovery of the former territories of Yinchuan and Xiazhou." The court approved his plan. Upon completion, the fortress was named **Qingjian City**.

Among the **Fan** tribes was a chieftain named **Niujia Nuer**, who had long dominated the borderlands and never once paid homage to the prefectural governor. Upon hearing of Shiheng’s name, however, he immediately rode out to greet him. Shiheng made an appointment, promising to visit Nuer’s encampment the following day to extend his regards to the tribe. That night, snow fell three feet deep. His attendants warned, "The terrain is treacherous—you cannot go." Shiheng replied, "I am now forging trust with the Qiang tribes; I cannot break my word." He pressed forward through the perilous paths. Nuer, still abed in his tent, assumed Shiheng would never arrive. When Shiheng suddenly roused him, Nuer was astonished: "Never before has an official come to my camp. Yet you place such trust in me!" He led his clan to prostrate themselves and pledge obedience.

While stationed at Qingjian City, **Yuan Hao** had not yet submitted. His trusted advisors, the **Yeli** brothers, held great influence, and Shiheng sought to sow discord between them. There was a monk named **Wang Guangxin**, a man of valor who knew the tribal roads well. Shiheng memorialized the throne to appoint him as a *sanban jiezhi* (temporary official) and had him deliver a letter to the Yeli brothers, urging them to defect early. Yuan Hao believed the ruse and grew suspicious of the brothers, ultimately executing them. He then sent his minister **Li Wengui** to report, offering to negotiate peace and requesting a single word of assurance. Shiheng informed **Fan Zhongyan**, who instructed him to convey the court’s magnanimous intent to accept their submission and allow Wengui to return with the message. Thereafter, Yuan Hao sought surrender and resumed his former vassalage.

**Record states:** Observing the Zhong clan, we see they descended from exiled royalty and initially held no renown in their time. Yet their descendants became famed generals. The key to their achievements began with Qingjian and Nuer, and concluded with the Yeli brothers. At first, they faced unfathomable depths and unforeseen dangers; in the end, they leveraged past trust to devise future strategies. Those who command the frontier today—how could they not grasp their duty?

Some say: "In Shiheng’s era, **Emperor Renzong** ruled above, and **Zhongyan** served below—thus success was possible. Had the sovereign not been magnanimous and broad-minded, or the general not upright, impartial, and trustworthy, even a momentary stratagem would have failed, let alone securing a legacy for posterity." This, too, must not be overlooked.

**Sima Guang** was a man of loyalty, integrity, and honesty. From youth to old age, he never spoke falsely. He once said: "I have no extraordinary qualities, but all my life, I have never done anything I could not declare openly." His sincerity was innate, and the world revered and trusted him. In the regions of **Shan** and **Luo**, people were transformed by his virtue. If someone acted wrongly, they would ask, "Surely **Junshi** (Guang’s courtesy name) does not know of this?" When he entered the government, he abolished nearly all the new laws that harmed the people.

Some warned: "Many of the old ministers from the **Xining** era are cunning and frugal. One day, if the emperor questions the righteousness of father and son, disaster will strike." Guang replied sternly: "If Heaven blesses the Song, such a thing will not occur." Thus, the realm placed its faith in him, saying, "This was the late emperor’s true intent."

**Record states:** Why should one do anything that cannot be spoken of openly? For "man" is the term by which one refers to oneself—how can one deceive oneself and expect to deceive others? Those who seek to deceive others may employ a hundred schemes, yet the clarity of their true heart will never be obscured. Such efforts are but fragmented and muddled, like a drunken man babbling and stumbling. The *Commentary on the Great Learning* states: "What is meant by making one’s intentions sincere? It is to not deceive oneself." It also says: "Others see one as if they could perceive one’s lungs and liver." How can one who does not trust themselves be trusted by others? The reforms he implemented and the harmful laws he abolished all stemmed from this self-trust. Even Heaven’s favor toward the Song could not alter this.

**Tang Jie**, appointed as *Can Zhizhengshi* (Vice Grand Councilor), believed his advancement came through upright conduct. Moved by the emperor’s recognition, he devoted himself to serving his lord with pure sincerity and utmost dedication, offering candid advice on governance. In personnel matters, he forthrightly assessed abilities, neither currying favor nor shirking enmity. When debating policies with colleagues, he argued repeatedly without yielding. He was especially cautious regarding changes to ancestral laws or the promotion and demotion of close ministers. Even before the emperor, he would press his case with incisive reasoning, never wavering from what he deemed right. The emperor thus held him in greater respect and trust, and the realm eagerly admired his conduct.

**Record states:** How fortunate was **Tang Zifang**! At first, his reputation for integrity resounded throughout the land; in the end, his uprightness filled the court.

Though born into this world as one of its people, even the lowliest scholar should aspire to live up to his station, for does not even the earthworm value its own worth? Though holding but a single office, he should still seek to render service, for does not even the ant aspire to great deeds? Thus, when one’s worth is recognized and met with unwavering trust and respect, the bond between ruler and subject remains unbroken—nothing more is needed.

Chang Anmin believed that governing with sincerity and trust was the foundation of order, for the noble of heart cannot bear to deceive. When he and An Dun were colleagues, Dun—a man of deep cunning—would often slander those he had once befriended. Anmin said to him, "Does such a man not owe loyalty to his lord? Why do you speak so harshly of him?" Dun replied, "In truth, I despise him—I merely feign friendship." Anmin said, "What you describe is ‘concealing hatred while pretending friendship’—the way of Li Linfu." Dun laughed and said, "If the Way of uprightness prevails, you shall surpass me in rank." Thus, Anmin often remarked, "If men like Dun are honored, the fate of the realm is clear. I should retire and withdraw, for why contend over right and wrong? I fear only that it would harm my hidden virtue." Later, Dun’s son was executed for crimes, just as Anmin had foreseen.

During the Yuanfeng era, though the powerful ministers of the time had been removed from court, their factions still spread throughout the bureaucracy, advancing private agendas to sway governance. Anmin was deeply troubled by this and wrote to Lord Lü Ruo, saying: "To discern the trends of the world is like a skilled physician examining an illness. In times of peace and calm, if one warns of future peril, the crowd will surely mock and scoff. Only those with keen insight can foresee the subtle signs. Thus, true wisdom lies not in worrying over what is already worrisome, but in worrying over what seems unworthy of concern—this is the deepest worry of all.

Removing petty men is not difficult; defeating them is. The disasters of the Five Princes of Chen and Dou are precedents from past ages. Even if loyal and upright men are promoted today, unless we gather the finest talents from across the land and assemble them at court to overpower the petty men, I fear that the principled and the righteous will not rest easy. For if ten men oppose one tiger, the men prevail; if one man opposes two tigers, the tigers prevail. How then can a few dozen contend with a thousand tigers?" His words proved prophetic in every detail.

He further remarked: "Zhang Huiqing is base by nature and deeply treacherous. Now, as he passes through the capital, he will surely invoke the late emperor with tears to move Your Majesty’s heart, hoping to remain in the capital." Later, when Huiqing requested an audience, the emperor maintained a stern countenance and did not respond, much to the satisfaction of contemporary opinion.

He also spoke at length against Zhang Dun, Cai Que, and Zeng Bu. At the time, Cai Jing’s wickedness had not yet become apparent, and many did not believe it. Yet Anmin alone declared: "Jing’s treachery is sufficient to delude the masses; his eloquence is sufficient to gloss over his faults; his cunning is sufficient to distort the sovereign’s perception; and his power is sufficient to invert right and wrong across the realm." His memorials on this matter numbered in the dozens or even hundreds, and all were incisive.

**Recorded Reflection:**
Divination by milfoil and tortoise shell, along with medicine and stone needles, are all prized in the world. For medicine and stone needles can cure existing illnesses, while milfoil and tortoise shell can foretell future calamities. Without divination, medicine and stone needles would have no recourse; without medicine and stone needles, divination would lack proof of its efficacy. The crux lies in how one weighs and decides.

The realm of Song may be likened to a single human body. At first, it did not trust gentle remedies, recklessly administering potent drugs without restraint, so that internally, its vital organs, and externally, its limbs, all fell gravely ill. Midway, it vigorously applied old prescriptions, devising countless measures to protect and restore itself, so that above, its brow and countenance, and below, its complexion, all showed signs of recovery. In the end, however, the medicine failed to induce the necessary shock, and the illness did not abate. Thus, the malady worsened even as slight improvement appeared; complacency arose from indolence; and between the region above the diaphragm and below the heart, the affliction became irreparably entrenched.

Anmin’s words were as certain as divination or lightning. Yet they went unused because the nation’s primordial qi had been exhausted. The flourishing or decline of a dynasty hinges on the waxing and waning of its fate; the life and death of men depend on the length of their allotted span. Had the Seven Worthies of the Xuan era been blessed by Heaven to live long, to uphold perfect impartiality, and to forever secure the altars of state, how could mere trifling missteps have led to ruin? Even with a hundred wolves or a thousand tigers, they would have seen the sky brighten and the sun rise, unable to indulge their roars. Alas!

The Yuanyou era fell into ruin, and the Shaosheng era followed in its wake. The imperial court became a thicket of thorns, and men were transformed into gulls and wagtails. As the *Book of Songs* says: "Within, it festered in the Central Kingdom; without, it spread to the distant lands." These words are not [missing character] to be trusted, and all the more grievous to bear.

Yang Bangjiu possessed a radiant and refined countenance, tall as a mountain in stature, and all who saw him cherished him. In times of peace, he harmed no one, but when faced with crisis, he acted with resolute courage—ten thousand men could not sway him. His virtue was cultivated at home, renowned in his village, and trusted among his friends. That he ultimately gave his life for the state, establishing a monumental moral standard for all ages, was no mere accident of the moment.

When he first took charge of Liyang, his decrees were clear and steadfast. At the time, the rebel soldier Zhou De had seized the prefectural city, killing officials. Bangjiu then released the imprisoned Zhao Ming in the courtyard, binding him with sincerity and trust before sending him away. The next day, Zhao Ming indeed rallied the village’s stalwarts to capture the rebels and quell the uprising.

Later, as *Tongpan* of Jiankang, when Jin forces crossed the river, Du Ke ordered the city to be defended, and Bangjiu once more placed his trust in him. The following day, Ke fled, leaving Jinling empty of troops. Prefect Chen Bangguang then exited the city to surrender to the enemy, and Ke was the first to yield. Only Bangjiu remained unyielding, shouting: "Do you take me for one who would bow to barbarians?" Bangguang relayed this to Wumu, who said: "Bangjiu has long been ill." He sent a close associate to persuade him: "You have always been poor. Your elder brother is aged, relying on your salary for support. Your widowed sister-in-law and orphaned nephews have come from afar to depend on you. You have five young sons and an unmarried daughter—do you not think of them?" Bangjiu replied: "These are the common sentiments of men. Are my five children devoid of feeling? The state and the family cannot both stand. I have no doubt in my resolve."

Wumu set out wine and summoned those who had surrendered to drink. Bangjiu ascended the steps but struck his head against a pillar, declaring: "How could I share a feast with dogs and swine?" The next day, Bangguang again urged him: "There is no recourse in this matter. I beg you to reconsider. To die in vain is of no benefit." Bangjiu glared and said: "You, a minister of the court charged with defending the realm, failed to die in the face of disaster, instead willingly bending the knee. If all follow your example, what will become of the court?" At that moment, the military commissioner Liu presented him with a slip of paper, saying: "Speak no more. If you act for the Zhao house, write 'death'; if for me, write 'life.'" Bangjiu took the brush and wrote "death." Liu still did not believe him, so Bangjiu cut his flesh and wrote in blood on his robe: "I would rather be a ghost of the Zhao house than a minister of another state." The following day, when questioned again, Bangjiu cursed fiercely, tore his robe to reveal the bloodstained words, and the barbarians finally believed him. They then put him to death, cutting open his abdomen to examine his heart.

The record states: I observe that Zong Ze’s indignation, Du Ke’s cowardice, Bangguang’s surrender, and Bangjiu’s disembowelment all stemmed from the machinations of Wang and Huang and the sovereign’s lack of firm virtue. Moreover, Jinling was the convergence of imperial *qi*—not to be compared with a mere corner of Jiangzhe. Though the emperor had lost the east, he might yet have recovered in the west. Yet, lacking any strategy, he sat and awaited destruction, prolonging the dynasty’s twilight for a few generations more. Confucius said: "Since all must die, the people will not stand without trust." Thus, a city may be breached, but a slip of paper cannot; a general may be captured, but a blood oath cannot. Had the loyal minister not acted, Jin would have been reduced to barbarian status. Yet by establishing sincerity and demonstrating trust, his integrity pierced the heavens and shone like the sun. Though he perished, his name endured, still relied upon.

Yue Fei was ordered to suppress Yang Gong, with Zhang Jun as overseer. As the court issued a decree to recall troops for autumn defense, Jun summoned Fei, intending to wait until the following year to discuss the matter. Fei said: "The plan is already set. If the overseer can delay but a little, the rebels can be crushed in no more than eight days." Jun asked: "Why do you speak so lightly of this?" Fei replied: "When the imperial army attacks the water bandits, it is difficult, for I attack them with their own kind—it is easy. In water warfare, our strength is their weakness. To use our weakness against their strength is why it is difficult. But if we turn their generals against their soldiers, sever their limbs from their body, and cut off their heart’s support, leaving them isolated and scattered, then the imperial army can strike. Within eight days, all their chieftains will be captured." Jun agreed, and Fei proceeded to Dingzhou.

Previously, his troops were all from the northwest and unskilled in naval combat. Fei said: "Soldiers are not inherently limited; it is how they are used that matters." He sent envoys to persuade the bandits, and Huang Zuo came over. Fei said to Cun Zuo: "Do you know that by distinguishing between rebellion and loyalty, you can achieve merit and be enfeoffed? Such things are hardly worth mentioning." At this, Zuo persuaded Yang Qin to surrender. Fei rejoiced: "Yang Qin is fierce and valiant. Now that he has surrendered, the bandits’ heart is broken." He sent Qin back to the lake, where Qin further convinced Quan Zong and Liu Si to defect. Gong, however, remained defiant. He moored his boats on the lake, using waterwheels to propel them swiftly. The imperial ships that approached were shattered by his ramming poles. Fei had trees from Junshan felled to build massive rafts, blocking the ports and shallows. He then sent rotting wood and tangled grass floating downstream. At shallow points, he dispatched skilled provocateurs to taunt the bandits, cursing as they advanced. Enraged, the bandits pursued, only to find their boats entangled in the debris, their wheels immobilized. The imperial forces then struck swiftly. The bandits fled into the ports, only to be blocked by the rafts. The imperial troops, shielded by cowhide against arrows and stones, used massive logs to ram the bandit boats, destroying them all. Yao then plunged into the water and drowned.

Fei entered the bandit stronghold. The remaining chieftains, astonished, exclaimed: "What manner of spirit is this?" They all begged to surrender.

The victory dispatch arrived in just eight days. Jun exclaimed in delight: "Commander Yue is truly a divine strategist!" Earlier, Yao had boasted of his stronghold’s impregnability, declaring: "Only if Fei himself flies here could anyone breach my defenses." Now, people took his words as prophecy fulfilled.

The record states: While all praise Commander Yue’s divine calculations, I humbly suggest it was Fei’s self-assuredness that prevailed. He himself declared: "Wisdom, trustworthiness, benevolence, courage, and discipline—none may be lacking." Observe how he turned water bandits against water bandits: this was his wisdom. Victory in eight days as promised: this was his trustworthiness. Able to summon them at will and dismiss them without harm, winning their hearts: this was his benevolence. His bold claim—"Only if Fei himself flies here"—demonstrated his courage. Insisting the regional commander remain without delay, brooking no further debate: this was his discipline. Wisdom kept him from entrapment; trustworthiness ensured no deviation; benevolence spared lives; courage banished fear; discipline prevented confusion. Compared to the futile campaigns at Fuping and Fuli, those were but child’s play.

Yet when this man of peerless strategy later faced the deliberations of the high command, he was forced to act against his convictions—how much more so in other matters! This is cause for lament on Jun’s behalf, not reproach for Fei. Alas, how lamentable!

Yang Cunzhong was a man of loyalty and prudence. When Emperor Gaozong was still Prince Kang, establishing the Grand Marshal’s Headquarters, he placed his utmost trust in Cunzhong. At the time, the headquarters was newly formed, and Cunzhong guarded the imperial sleeping quarters day and night, never leaving his side even for a moment. After the court crossed the Yangtze and settled in the Jiang-Zhe region, Cunzhong, leading the Shengjie Army, followed Zhang Jun to defend Wumen. During the rebellion of Miao and Liu, he accompanied Jun to face the crisis and was promoted to Commander of the Imperial Guard, then to Commander of the Central Shenwu Army. Jun later sought to retain him in the military, but the Emperor said: "The imperial guard lacks a commander, and I have already made my choice—this cannot be altered." For twenty-five years, he served at the palace. When the Jin ruler Wanyan Liang harbored intentions of invading the south, Cunzhong submitted ten strategies for defense. The infantry commander Zhao Mi conspired to seize his authority, falsely accusing him of seeking glory and stirring trouble, and ultimately replaced him. Soon after, border tensions escalated daily, and the Emperor traveled to Jiankang, ordering Cunzhong to oversee the imperial guard and escort his retinue. He told his chief minister: "Yang Cunzhong obeys commands without hesitation—his loyalty is unmatched. He is my Guo Ziyi." He also said: "Among all the generals I favor, I have shown Cunzhong the deepest care, treating him more warmly than my own sons and brothers. When Zhao Mi replaced him, I could not sleep for three nights." Thus, he served the court for over forty years. Emperor Xiaozong later held him in even higher esteem, addressing him as "Prince" without using his name.

The chronicler notes: Observing the generals of the Restoration, Yue Fei was the most perilous, while Yang Cunzhong was the most steadfast. The perilous one was like surging waves and roaring thunder, yet never strayed from righteousness—thus, he is revered by later generations. The steadfast one was like a finger to an arm, an arm to a body, moving east or west only as commanded—thus, he brought comfort to his sovereign. Consider how Qin Hui executed Yue Fei without a word, yet when Zhao Mi replaced Cunzhong, the Emperor could not sleep. Here, the depth of the Emperor’s regard is revealed—not merely a matter of trust between ruler and subject.

From *Records of Illustrious Ministers of the August Ming*: The virtuous Minister Li Wenda was a man of loyalty, integrity, strictness, and discretion. In dealings with colleagues, he upheld harmony, valued trust, and even when opinions clashed, never lost his composure. When opportunity arose, he acted on his convictions—after the Three Yangs, none could match him. Emperor Yingzong favored him uniquely, and Emperor Xianzong, upon ascending the throne, trusted him even more deeply. Early on, he recommended Provincial Administrator Lu Yu for Minister of Justice. When Shi Heng endorsed the recommendation for personal gain, the Emperor delayed the audience, causing others to fear for Li. Yet when Lu Yu arrived and the edict for his appointment was drafted, colleagues suggested demoting him to Vice Minister. Li said: "I recommended him as Minister. To change it to Vice Minister would be a breach of my word." The Emperor ultimately appointed him as Minister. Later, Lu Yu proved highly capable, and the Emperor resumed their regular audiences.

Li also recommended Geng Jiujiu as Censor-in-Chief, who was soon promoted to Minister of Works. When Geng was sidelined by Shi Heng and the latter encroached on his authority, Geng feigned illness and resigned. Li repeatedly petitioned the Emperor to reinstate him. Nian Fu was falsely accused of rebellion by Shi Biao, but after Heng’s downfall, Li argued that Fu was worthy of high office and had him appointed Minister of Revenue. When a vacancy arose for Vice Minister of Rites, a court favorite sought Li’s recommendation. The Emperor asked: "What do you think of him?" Li replied: "I do not know the man. The one I know is Academician Li Shao." He added: "Recently, the scholar-official class has declined, with many currying favor for advancement. If we appoint based on merit and summon the Ministry of Personnel to issue a decree, perhaps the literati will take heed." At the time, Chief Minister Wang Ao was respected for his seniority, and Ma Xu for his dignified bearing—both were favored by the Emperor. Whenever Li made recommendations, he would first convey his intent: civil matters to Wang, military to Ma. When presenting candidates at court, after stating his opinion, he would always say: "This is my judgment, but it would be best to summon them for further review." In the end, both men’s assessments aligned with Li’s. Thus, the Emperor never doubted him, and all below trusted him.

The chronicler observes: During the reign of Emperor Yingzong, slanderers and malefactors thronged the court. Fortunately, Heaven’s will turned against disorder, and men like Cao Qin and Shi Heng proved intolerable to the throne. Thus, the sovereign reclaimed the authority they had usurped and wielded it anew. Lord Li, ever mindful of the Sweet Dew Incident and the calamities of factional proscription, refused to indulge in the reckless acts that prolong strife. Thereby, slanderous words found no purchase, trust deepened, and in time he fulfilled his role as chief minister in securing the realm’s peace.

Later generations, failing to learn from what has already come to pass, nor to guard against what is yet to be, rely solely on impassioned conduct, hoping to achieve the impossible. Not only do they forfeit trust, but they invite ruin. This is why readers must take heed.

Censor-in-Chief Han Yong was a man of penetrating insight and forthright candor, steadfast in loyalty and resolve, unafraid to act and unwavering in his duty. In the yiyou year of Chenghua (1465), the two Guang provinces remained unsettled. Han, together with Commander-in-Chief Zhao Fu, was dispatched to quell the unrest. The two men deferred to and trusted one another, deliberating in close counsel as if they were brothers or friends in private discourse.

Initially, they planned to divide the Jiangxi troops, sending them through Shouling into Guangdong, while the main force would advance from Huguang into Guangxi. Their reasoning was that if the rebels were in Guangdong, they should be driven out, and if in Guangxi, they should be encircled. Han disagreed: "This is not so. In ancient times, generals commanding troops beyond the frontier were granted full authority. If their actions could secure the state and benefit the realm, such discretion was justified. Armies may be concentrated for direct assault or divided for surprise maneuvers. Now, the two Guang provinces lie in ruins, and the rebels’ stronghold at Dafeng Gorge remains untouched. To pursue peripheral threats while neglecting the heart of the matter is no path to victory. If we advance with our forces intact, we may strike Dafeng to the south, reinforce Nanshao to the east, seize Liuqing to the west, and cut off Yangdong to the north. With all routes engaged, nothing will withstand us—why waste effort on mere pursuit?"

He further proposed luring the rebels from Xiuren, Lipu, Yao, and Kao, then striking them down, so that the remaining factions might be pacified without further labor. Han countered: "To issue an imperial decree and launch a punitive campaign, righteousness must prevail. To lure and then kill them would be a breach of trust and honor." Thus, he dispatched twenty-five patrols in all directions, while he, along with the eunuch overseer, the commander-in-chief, and Guangxi’s regional commander Ou Xin, led the central column in a coordinated assault.

Within a month, Xiuren and Lipu were pacified. The army then advanced to Dezhou, pressing forward with momentum. Han proclaimed the weight of the court’s authority and the inevitability of the rebels’ destruction. The troops responded with a thunderous cry, and in the end, the rebellion was crushed.

Han’s strategy was guided by adaptability as its core and strict rewards and punishments as its support. His impartiality and lack of self-interest ensured swift and decisive success.

The chronicler notes: As the *Tradition* states, "What Heaven aids is alignment; what men aid is trust. To walk in trust and attain alignment—this is the way to success." Thus, a man like Han Yong may well be counted among the heroes of his age.

*Hongdao Record*, Scroll 50 (concluded)

**Hongdao Record, Scroll 51: Trust**

**Trust Between Father and Son**

Mencius said: When all under Heaven rejoice and turn to one, to regard the world’s joy and allegiance as mere grass or dust—only Shun could do so.

One who fails to win the trust of his parents cannot be called a man. One who is not filial to his parents cannot be called a son.

The chronicler notes: Shun’s heart was steadfast in its conviction that his parents were utterly trustworthy, without the slightest doubt. Those who betray the bond between father and son do so because trust was lacking from the very beginning. Thus, when Emperor Xuanzong suspected Emperor Ruizong of plotting against him, the slander of Wang Ju later found purchase. When Emperor Suzong suspected Emperor Minghuang of winning the people’s favor, the schemes of Li Fuguo then took hold.

Liu Weng further expounded: Those ministers who murder their lords, or sons who murder their fathers, often begin by finding fault in them. Alas! What they first perceive becomes the seed of their later suspicion.

*The Shang Hymns* say:
Heaven commanded the dark bird,
Descending to give birth to Shang,
Dwelling in the vast land of Yin.
The ancient emperor commanded Wu Tang,
To rectify the four quarters.

*The Greater Odes* say:
At the beginning of the people’s birth,
There was Jiang Yuan.
How did she bear the people?
She was able to offer sacrifice and pray.
Having no child, she trod in the prints of the Lord’s steps and rejoiced.
There she conceived and rested,
Carrying the child in trembling care.
She bore and reared him,
And he became Hou Ji.

The chronicler notes: These are the founding ancestors of Shang and Zhou, recorded in the *Odes*—but can they truly be trusted? No. Poetry seeks to grasp the intent behind the words. Only with the virtue of a fitting match can there be the virtue of worthy descendants. This is the constant principle of Heaven and Earth, the supreme truth of human life.

In ancient times, when Gaoxin ruled all under Heaven, he bestowed benefits universally, not for his own sake, acting with awe in governance and trust in kindness. The emperor took four consorts: his first, a daughter of the Youhe clan, named Jiang Yuan, who bore Hou Ji; next, a daughter of the Chenfeng clan, named Qingdu, who bore Yao; then, a daughter of the Youe clan, named Jiandi, who bore Xie; and finally, a daughter of the Shenzi clan, named Changyi, who bore Zhi. Though Gaoxin possessed sagely virtue and his four consorts were his matches, the birth of his sagely sons was but the natural course of things. The auspicious sign of the dark bird and the marvel of treading in the Lord’s steps occurred by chance—not that there was no human agency, that a child was born merely from the hatching of an egg or the following of footprints.

Those who composed the *Odes* sought to craft fine words, so they added the phrase “Heaven’s command” and embellished the tale of Qi’s birth with details like the narrow lane, the frozen ice, and the calves of oxen and sheep shielding him. Such is the way of poetry—one must not let the words obscure the meaning. How could one take such accounts literally? To ascribe to the sagely Gaoxin as father and then burden the sages of all ages with fantastical and implausible tales is to miss the true purpose of the *Odes*. The fault lies in failing to grasp their original intent.

The Confucian scholar’s duty is to fathom principle. Even those who recite the *Three Hundred Odes* may not fully understand them—so why be surprised by the absurdities of Buddhism and Daoism? Consider the tales of the Buddha emerging from his mother’s side, filling the room with fragrance; Yi Yin born from a hollow mulberry; or Laozi born with white hair—such accounts, though recorded to convey truth, cannot go unexamined.

*The Spring and Autumn Annals* record: In the ninth month of the sixth year of Duke Huan of Lu, on the day *dingmao*, Zitong was born.

The chronicler notes: Since the lament of *Xiao Bian* arose, the way between father and son has been fractured. In composing the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the Master was grieved by this. Thus, though the record concerns Lu, it was not for Lu’s sake alone. It was to express sorrow for Duke Huan’s misfortune that the birth was recorded with joy. How true this is in the end!

Yet the *Zuozhuan* states: Our Master’s intent in distinguishing suspicion and clarifying doubt reached its utmost here. Only after husband and wife are properly ordered can father and son be close. Duke Huan’s infatuation and Lady Wen Jiang’s transgressions were unheard of in all history. The *Annals* record the birth on the ninth month, *dingmao*, to reveal the truth. The *Odes* say, “Behold my nephew,” subtly indicating the matter. This was to guard against other claims. Duke Huan himself said, “Tong is not my son, but the son of the Marquis of Qi.” Thus, the text does not merely clarify the law of father and son, nor does it merely prevent the usurpation of legitimacy (as Hu Anguo’s commentary suggests). Rather, it was to condemn Duke Huan’s later misdeeds and resolve a doubt that had lingered for ages. In its concern for the teaching of the world, the *Annals* begins here with utmost urgency.

In the summer of the fifth year of Duke Xi of Lu, the duke met with the Marquis of Qi, the Duke of Song, the Marquis of Chen, the Marquis of Wei, the Earl of Zheng, the Baron of Xu, and the Earl of Cao at Shouzhi, along with the Crown Prince of Zhou. In the eighth month, the feudal lords swore an alliance at Shouzhi.

The chronicler notes: Why did the Zhou court move east? Why was King You killed at the foot of Mount Li? Why was the *Spring and Autumn Annals* composed? All stemmed from the instability of the crown prince. Once the foundation was shaken, disaster followed: the altars of the state were laid waste, the palaces overgrown with millet, the ruler himself slain—and still, they did not awaken. After one or two successions, there came the rebellion of Zi Ke, then the calamity of Zi Tui, and finally, the personal lesson of King Hui. Yet shortly after returning to the capital, the seeds of Shu Dai’s treachery sprouted. What was King Hui thinking?

Tracing the cause, it all arose from ignorance of the *Great Learning*’s way: delighting in what is not upright, becoming biased toward those one loves. If the self is not cultivated, the family cannot be ordered; if the family is not ordered, the state cannot be governed; if the state is not governed, all under Heaven cannot be at peace. Though King Hui was enlightened and trusted in others, in the end, he dared not announce the emperor’s death or mourn him, losing the bond between father and son.

The Rong tribes assaulted the royal capital, violating the bond of brotherhood; the Son of Heaven fled to reside in Zheng, abandoning the rites of lord and minister—all was provoked by King Hui’s own doing. Had it not been for Duke Huan and Guan Zhong, King Hui’s fate would have been scarcely distinguishable from that of King You, and where then would the Zhou have found refuge?

That our Master Confucius chose to record the affair at Xu was for the sake of the great plan of all under Heaven and myriad generations, not merely the fleeting seat of one man.

From the *Zuozhuan*: Ying Kaoshu was the warden of Yinggu. He presented a gift to the Duke, who bestowed food upon him. Kaoshu set aside the meat, and when the Duke inquired, he replied: “This humble one has a mother who has tasted all my food, yet never your lordship’s broth. I beg to offer it to her.” The Duke said, “You have a mother to whom you may give it, while I alone have none.” Kaoshu asked, “May I dare ask what you mean?” The Duke recounted the past and confessed his regret. Kaoshu replied, “Why does my lord trouble himself? If you dig down to the springs and meet in an underground passage, who would say it is not so?” The Duke followed his advice. Entering the tunnel, the Duke recited: “Within the great passage, joy flows as one.” Emerging, Lady Jiang recited: “Beyond the great passage, joy overflows in ease.” Thus, mother and son were restored as before. The noble man said: “Ying Kaoshu was pure in filial piety. Loving his mother, he extended it to Duke Zhuang.” As the *Poetry* says: “The filial son never fails, forever bestowing upon his kind.” This is what it means.

It is recorded: In my foolish view, Ying Kaoshu’s ability to illuminate great trust lay in this: the oath of a common man is shown in his sincerity, while the covenant of a noble man is bound by righteousness. Thus, a single word dispelled Duke Zhuang’s confusion.

Some say: Regret lies between trust and doubt. Without regret, one cannot guide another by what they already understand.

The mother of Ji You was a daughter of Duke Huan of Chen, favored and cherished by Duke Huan of Lu. When Ji You was about to be born, the Duke sent someone to divine his fate, who said: “A son, his name shall be You. At the Duke’s right hand, he will consult the two altars and serve as the state’s pillar. If the Ji clan perishes, Lu will not prosper.” They also cast milfoil, encountering *Great Possession* under *Qian*, and said: “The Zhou returns to the father, reverent as the lord’s command.” At birth, there was a mark on his hand reading “You,” so he was named thus and styled Chengji.

It is recorded: In my foolish view, Ji You’s birth was Heaven’s way of suppressing chaos, not merely for Duke Huan’s sake. For Duke Huan and Duke Zhuang failed as rulers, Duke Wen and Duke Ai failed as wives, the repeated assassinations of Duke Ban and Duke Min, and the prolonged rebellion of the two Shus—Lu had ceased to be Lu, teetering on the brink. Had no worthy man been born in its midst, would the sacrifices to the Duke of Zhou not have fallen? The mark on his hand was a sign from his palm. Heaven’s intent seemed to say: “Those who befriend shall prosper; those who do not shall perish.” To succeed Duke Ban and Duke Min was the Way of friendship. Otherwise, Ji You was but the descendant of a licentious man—what virtue did he hold before Heaven? His enthronement of Duke Xi stabilized Lu, averting disaster and preserving the state.

Divination and milfoil omens run deep indeed.

When Cheng Feng heard of Chengji’s peril, she served him and entrusted Duke Xi to his care. Thus, Chengji established him.

It is recorded: Was Duke Xi’s enthronement the work of man or of Heaven? It was Heaven. The calamity of Peng Sheng was brought about by Wen Jiang—this was the first severance by Heaven. The arrival of Ai Jiang was abhorred by the ancestral temples—this was the second. Then came Meng Ren’s elopement, followed immediately by the strife of the stableman Luo—this was the third. The enthronement of Zikai was met with the usurpation of the divined fields—this was the fourth. That the Feng clan succeeded the Jiang clan in producing an heir was like the Bo clan succeeding the Lü clan in assuming the throne. Was this not truly Heaven’s doing?

Xi Qi and Zhuo Zi were the sons of Li Ji. Xun Xi was their guardian. As Duke Xian neared his end, he said to Xi: “What must a man be to be called trustworthy?” Xi replied: “If the dead could return to life and the living feel no shame, then his words may be called trustworthy.” The Duke approved.

After the Duke’s death, Xi Qi was enthroned. Li Ke said to Xi: “The lord killed the rightful heir and enthroned the unrightful. What is to be done? I wish to deliberate with you.” Xi replied: “The lord once questioned me. I answered: ‘If the dead could return to life and the living feel no shame, then his words may be called trustworthy.’” Li Ke knew he could not be swayed. Retreating, he assassinated Xi Qi, then Xi. Xi remained loyal to the end.

The noble man said: “Xun Xi may be said to have not broken his word.”

It is recorded: Weili was trustworthy, yet he secretly met a woman—this was not upright. Why then does the noble man praise Xun Xi? In praising Xun Xi, he condemns Li Ke all the more. For Ke’s transmission to Shensheng was rightful in name and principle, unlike Xi’s transmission to Xi Qi. A single word from You Shi struck the mark, yet how vastly different was it from “the dead returning to life and the living feeling no shame”? Had Ke upheld righteousness without wavering, he might have saved Shensheng from disaster—this would have been best. Or, had he remained unwavering unto death, perishing alongside the crown prince, that would have been next. Yet he not only yielded to his desires but also masked his face, assassinating one lord at dawn and another at dusk. Of such a man as Ke, I know not why Duke Hui did not clearly punish his crime, instead using the pretext of deposition and enthronement. What then was the state of Jin’s laws and governance? Thus, the Master repeatedly condemned Duke Hui. In condemning Duke Hui, was it not also for Li Ke’s sake?

The Lord Wen of Zheng had a lowly concubine named Yan Gu, who dreamed that a celestial messenger gave her an orchid, saying: “I am Bo Tiao, your ancestor. Take this as your son, for the orchid bears the fragrance of the state.” Such was the allure that captivated all who beheld it. Later, Lord Wen saw her, presented her with the orchid, and lay with her. She declined, saying: “This handmaid is unworthy. Should I bear a child by fortune, none would believe it. Dare I ask for the orchid as proof?” The lord replied: “Very well.” She gave birth to Duke Mu, whom she named Lan.

It is recorded: Mencius said, “The Son of Heaven may recommend a man to Heaven, yet cannot make Heaven grant him the realm. The feudal lords may recommend a man to the Son of Heaven, yet cannot make the Son of Heaven grant him a state.” When Zihua was established as crown prince, he had already received Heaven’s mandate, pledged as hostage among the feudal lords, and Zheng’s succession was firmly settled. The birth of Zilan was met with doubt and uncertainty, let alone the multitude of other princes. Yet through Zheng’s internal strife, he was slain, leading to a tumult of exiles and pursuits—the flight of Zizang, the poisoning of Zishi, the early deaths of Zixia and Ziyu without heirs. Only then did Shigui’s counsel prevail, the plans of the three Kongs take hold, and the great covenant of the high ministers secure the flourishing of the Ling and Xiang lineages for generations. Was this not Heaven’s doing? Though later omens like the blue dragon coiled upon the belly differed in form, alas, Lan—was he not fragrant as the orchid, was he not Heaven’s chosen?

King Gong of Chu had no principal heir but five favored sons. Unsure whom to appoint, he performed grand rites at the altars of the land and grain, praying: “Let the spirits choose among these five to rule the state.” He then wrapped a jade disk in cloth and presented it at the altars, declaring: “Whoever bows directly over the disk shall be Heaven’s chosen. Who would dare defy this?” Secretly, he and Lady Ba buried the disk in the courtyard of the great chamber, then had the five sons enter in purification to bow. King Kang stepped over it, King Ling placed his elbow upon it, while Zigan and Zhezhe kept their distance. Prince Ping, being young, was carried in; he bowed twice, pressing down upon the clasp. Dou Weigui and others affirmed this as Cheng Ran’s doing.

It is recorded: Observing King Gong’s actions, I cannot but sigh. A father betrays his sons, trusting not himself but spirits, choosing not men but ghosts, eschewing open and evident deeds for covert and inscrutable schemes. Yao and Shun received Heaven’s mandate through their conduct, not through signs. Never have I heard of one pressing down upon a disk’s clasp to claim it. What role did Lady Ba play? Her love and aversion were surely embedded in the burial of the disk. That some bowed rightly and others did not—was this not a lesson in usurpation? Where there are usurpers above, there will be those who aid them below. This is how Chu became Chu, and why the five sons ultimately rose and fell through regicide. Who, then, was truly Heaven’s chosen?

Lady Jiang, wife of Duke Xiang of Wei, bore no sons. A palace woman, Chou Shi, gave birth to Meng Zhi. Kong Chengzi dreamed that Kang Shu said to him: “Establish Yuan. I have sent Ji’s grandson Yu and the scribe Gou to assist him.” Scribe Zhao also dreamed of this, and their visions aligned. In the year when Han Kangzi of Jin visited the feudal lords, Chou Shi bore a son, whom she named Yuan. Meng Zhi’s feet were weak, and he walked with difficulty. Kong Chengzi divined for him, saying: “Yuan shall enjoy the state of Wei and preside over its altars.” He showed this to Scribe Zhao, who said: “If Yuan is to enjoy it, what doubt remains?” Chengzi asked: “Does this not refer to the eldest?” Zhao replied: “Kang Shu named him—can he not be called eldest? Meng is no true son; he will not be listed in the ancestral temple and cannot be called eldest. Moreover, the oracle says: ‘Benefit in establishing a lord.’ The divination aligns with the dream, as used by King Wu. Though his feet are weak, he shall reside as lord, preside over the altars, oversee sacrifices, govern the people, serve the spirits, and attend court assemblies. Each shall act according to what benefits him—is this not fitting?” Thus, Kong Chengzi established Duke Ling.

It is recorded: Observing the blessings of virtue and the calamities of vice, Heaven’s Way has never failed. Amid the chaos of Xuan Jiang and the infirmity of Meng Xi, Heaven had surely revoked Wei’s heir. Yet Kang Shu’s sacrifices could not be abandoned, nor the transmission of the Ji virtue erased. Even without the dream of the yielding clasp or Scribe Zhao’s divination, could the enthronement of Ziyuan have been averted? Yet without proof, there is no trust, and without trust, the people will not follow. Wei’s ministers were truly followers of goodness. In the end, Gong Meng was content in his place, not resentful of not being eldest, and Duke Ling benefited as lord, not deprived for being a younger son. Was this not why the Master, in recording Duke Xiang of Wei’s death, also praised him? Otherwise, the ensuing chaos would have far exceeded what has been recounted.

The Master said: “How filial was Min Ziqian! No one could find fault with his father, mother, brothers, or kin.”

It is recorded: In praising Ziqian’s filiality, the Master necessarily grounded it in his parents and brothers, for Ziqian’s mother was like Shun’s mother, and his younger brother like Shun’s brother. If a father is kind but a mother unkind, people will fault the mother; if an elder brother is loving but a younger brother unkind, people will fault the younger brother. This is why Shun’s mother could not escape resentment, and his brother Xiang could not escape arrogance. Ziqian, with utmost kindness and sincerity, guided them with sorrowful words and actions. Thus, his father abandoned his intent to expel his mother, his mother relinquished her resentment, and the three sons each adhered to their kin. Only then did Ziqian escape others’ reproach. This was the practical conduct of the Confucian school, not something that can be refuted.

The *Book of Han* states: Emperor Gaozu’s surname was Liu. His father was called the Grand Duke, and his mother, Madam Liu. Long ago, Madam Liu once rested by the embankment of a great marsh. She dreamed of encountering a spirit. At that moment, thunder and lightning darkened the sky. The Grand Duke went to look and saw two dragons intertwined above her. Soon after, she conceived and gave birth to Gaozu.

High Ancestor was a man of towering brow and noble visage, with a beard and left-leaning thigh, bearing seventy-two black moles. He was broad in virtue and love for others, his spirit expansive and unconstrained.

High Ancestor once resided in Xianyang, gazing upon the First Emperor of Qin in solemn admiration. He sighed deeply and declared, *"A true man should be like this!"*

The *Record* states: *"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao. The Dao cannot be pushed to its extreme, for extremes inevitably reverse."* The flourishing of the Three Dynasties reached its zenith when the capital was established at Zheng and Luoyi, with the imperial domain at its grandest—thus the yang principle was pushed to its limit, fulfilling the warning of *"The overbearing dragon meets regret."* Hence arose the upheaval of the Zhou relocation.

The rise of the Five Hegemons reached its peak when the Jin was divided among three families and the Six States formed alliances—thus the yin principle was pushed to its limit, fulfilling the omen of *"The dragon battles in the wild."* Hence arose the calamity of Qin’s unification.

When both yin and yang were exhausted, the Dao of Heaven and Earth faltered gravely, giving rise to monstrous omens: chickens with the souls of ostriches, horses with horns—all signs of the debased replacing the noble, the insignificant displacing the great. Heaven and Earth’s intent, rather than bestowing blessings upon the exalted, prefers to entrust them to common folk. Even the Grand Duke and Madam Liu’s encounter with the divine, marked by thunder and darkness, was no grander than the traces of a giant or the auspicious phoenix—thus the Mandate of Heaven for Han was confirmed.

Bao Ji, the mother of Emperor Wen, was once young and loved by Guan’s wife, Zhao Ziren. They swore: *"Whoever rises in fortune first shall not forget the other."* Later, Guan’s wife, Zhao Ziren, was favored by Han Ruler first. In the fourth year of Han Ruler’s reign, while he sat upon the platform at Gaoling in Henan, these two beauties served him and laughed at Bao Ji’s earlier vow. Han Ruler inquired, and they truthfully reported it. His heart ached with pity for Bao Ji.

That day, he summoned her, intending to take her as consort. She replied, *"Last night, I dreamed of a black dragon pressing upon my chest."* The Emperor said, *"This is an omen of noble fortune. I shall fulfill it for you."* Thus she conceived and bore Emperor Wen within a year.

The *Record* states: *"Madam Liu’s dream was the Heaven-ordained sign of a new age. Bao Ji’s dream was the symbol of one who would aid the world and its people."* The rise and fall of the Qin and Han dynasties, from Madam Liu to Bao Ji, marked the beginning and end of an era. Thus, each bore Heaven’s appointed omens.

As the *Odes* say:
*"Bright and resplendent below, radiant and awe-inspiring above—
Heaven’s will is not to be trifled with.
If one takes it lightly, it becomes a curse;
If one cherishes it, it becomes a blessing.
How could it not be the blood of hidden enmity,
The flesh of rival contention?"*

When Hun Douyi served as Prefect of Jingzhao, a man arrived, riding a yellow ox-drawn chariot, bearing a yellow canopy, clad in yellow robes and a yellow hat, claiming to be the Crown Prince of Wei. The public carriages reported this, and Douyi summoned officials, generals, and high-ranking officials to examine him. Tens of thousands in Chang’an gathered to watch. Neither the Chancellor, Grand Scribe, nor the high officials dared speak. Douyi said, *"Gentlemen, what fear do you have of the Wei Crown Prince? In the past, when he rebelled against the Emperor’s command and fled, he was resisted and not received. Now that he has come himself, guilty of treason, he should be punished."* He had the man sent to the imperial prison, where the Grand Prosecutor interrogated and exposed his deceit. Originally from Xianyang, he was named Cheng Fangsu, a fortune-teller by trade. A former servant of the Crown Prince had once consulted him, saying, *"Your appearance resembles the Wei Crown Prince."* Fangsu, coveting wealth and rank, falsely claimed the title to gain favor. After Douyi’s handling of this case, Zhao Guanghan also served as Prefect of Jingzhao and remarked, *"In detecting deceit and suppressing evil, I may have some skill, but in deciding matters of state, I fall far short of Douyi."*

The *Record* states: *"During the Tang Dynasty under Emperor Dezong, there was one who falsely claimed to be the mother of the Emperor, St. Shen, similar to this case, both convicted of fraud."* Only during the Song Dynasty under Emperor Gaozong was there one who falsely claimed to be Princess Yongfu. The Emperor accepted her without doubt, showering her with favor beyond measure. Though later exposed by Empress Wei and allowed to flee, he did not seek punishment—thus the Emperor’s regret was profound. This case of Cheng Fangsu’s treachery could not have been better handled than by Douyi.

Yu Dingguo’s father, Yu Gong, served as a county clerk and adjudicated cases with strict adherence to law, never harboring resentment. In the Lake region, there was a孝妇 (filial widow) who diligently cared for her mother-in-law. The mother-in-law, pitying her youth and childlessness, wished to remarry her, but she refused. The mother-in-law, burdened by her, hanged herself in despair. The mother-in-law’s daughter reported the matter to the authorities, and the filial widow confessed under interrogation. The case was submitted to the prefecture, but Yu Gong contested it, failing to overturn the verdict. The widow was executed, and the region suffered three years of drought. Later, when a new governor arrived, he consulted omens about the cause. Yu Gong said, *"Do not consult omens. The blame lies here."* The governor then sacrificed an ox at the widow’s grave, erected a tablet, and prayed for rain. Heaven answered with a great downpour, and the region revered Yu Gong, erecting a shrine in his honor.

Dingguo studied law under his father and also served as a clerk, later promoted to Lin Gao. When he became Grand Prosecutor, he was deeply trusted. He adjudicated cases with mercy, favoring the weak and elderly, and applied the principle of *"doubt in guilt, acquit."* He was renowned for his meticulous care. The court praised him: *"When Zhang Shizhi was Grand Prosecutor, there were no wronged subjects in the land. When Yu Dingguo was Grand Prosecutor, the people themselves felt no wrong."* From Yu Gong’s humble beginnings—when his gate collapsed and neighbors offered to repair it, he insisted it be made grand enough *"to hold a four-horse chariot and high canopy"*—he declared, *"I have often done hidden good in my judgments. My descendants will surely prosper."* Indeed, Dingguo became Chancellor, and his son, Yu Yong, served as Grand Scribe, receiving a hereditary marquisate.

To this day, people regard his words as trustworthy.

The *Record* states:
*"Zhang Shizhi’s ‘no wronged subjects’—this was Emperor Wen’s virtue.
Yu Dingguo’s ‘people felt no wrong’—this was Emperor Xuan’s wisdom.
His saying, ‘Hidden virtue ensures prosperity for descendants,’ was also the fate bestowed by the sovereign and ministers.
Those who observe should believe these accounts.*

*The Book of Later Han* records: *Mao Yi of Lujiang, in his youth, endured hardship with strict integrity and was renowned for his filial piety. Zhang Feng of Nanyang, hearing of his reputation, went to visit him. After sitting down, an official summons arrived appointing Yi as the Magistrate of Anyang. Yi took the writ and left, his face beaming with joy. Zhang Feng, who prized scholarly virtue, secretly despised this and regretted his visit, firmly declining to stay.

When Yi’s mother died, he resigned his post and observed mourning rites. Neither the government nor the public offices sent invitations. Zhang Feng then sighed, saying: *"The virtuous cannot be emulated. My earlier joy was for my own sake, bending to my parents’ will."*

Xie Bao of Samnan was studious and upright, and his filial devotion to his mother was widely known. When his father remarried and sent him away, Bao wept day and night, refusing to leave. He was beaten with a whip until, reluctantly, he built a hut outside his home. Each morning, he entered to sweep the stepmother’s quarters, but his father, enraged, drove him out again. He then built a hut at the village gate, attending to his duties without pause for over a year, until his parents, moved by his sincerity, took him back.

The *Record* states:
*"History says of these two sons that they acted from utmost sincerity, their hearts true, and thus could move others. Only then could they achieve renown in later ages and receive honors in their time. This is what it means to honor one’s parents."*

The *Record* continues:
*Lu Ji, when accused of conspiracy with King Ying of Chu, was imprisoned in the capital. His mother, traveling from Wu, arrived to visit him, but the guards barred her entry. She prepared food for him, and Ji, seeing it, wept bitterly. The guards, hearing his sorrow, asked why. Ji replied: *"My mother cuts meat always in squares, and chops scallions by the inch. The soup she sends is unlike any other—only she could prepare it this way. That is how I know."*

Cai Shun, orphaned young, was known for his filial care of his mother. Once, while gathering firewood, a guest arrived unexpectedly. His mother, seeing him delayed, bit her finger to summon him. Cai Shun, feeling the pain, rushed home and knelt, asking the reason. She said: *"A pressing guest has come—I bit my finger to awaken you."*

The *Record* states:
*"I observe how Lu’s mother prepared the meal and how Cai’s mother bit her finger—these acts prove the depth of natural filial trust. What is prized in the *Zhongyong* and shared by all is this: what is prized, one does not hesitate even for a meal’s time to disobey one’s parents; what is shared, one does not dare forget one’s mother even in a single step. Unlike others, who wait for trust to be earned before believing."*

*End of Volume Fifty-One of the *Principles of the Way Record*.
*Volume Fifty-Two: Faith—Parent-Child Trust.*

《Book of Tang》 records that the Great Sage Emperor of File and Martial Virtue, **Taizong** (posthumous title), whose personal name was **Shìmín** (世民), was the second son of **Gāozǔ** (高祖). His mother was **Empress Taimu** (太穆皇后, **Dòu Shì** 窦氏), born on the **wùwǔ** (戍午) day of the twelfth month in the **Kāihuáng** (开皇) seventeenth year of the **Sui Dynasty** (隋), at the **Biéguǎn** (别馆) of **Wǔgōng** (武功).

When he was just four years old, a scholar came to pay respects to **Gāozǔ** and said: *"You are a noble man."* Then, seeing **Taizong**, he declared: *"This one bears the bearing of a dragon and phoenix, the mark of heaven’s favor."* He added: *"When he reaches twenty years of age, he will surely be able to save the world and bring peace to the people."* **Gāozǔ**, taking these words to heart, named him **Shìmín**.

The *Record* states:
*"Mencius said: 'In five hundred years, there will surely arise a kingly sage, and among them will be one who is renowned in the world.' From the Han High Emperor (汉高) to the Tang, over five hundred years have passed. In between, there were the **Jìn** (晋), **Sòng** (宋), **Qí** (齐), **Liáng** (梁), and **Chén** (陈) dynasties, where usurpers and regicides numbered six or seven. Their courts lasted no more than a century, and the empire was plagued by chaos. Only the **Sui Dynasty** (隋) could unify it, yet it too began with usurpation and ended with usurpation. The **Tang Emperor’s** (皇矣) wisdom sought to avoid such fate repeatedly. This prophecy of saving the world and bringing peace was indeed trustworthy—it did not rely on the testimony of strangers, but was grounded in the natural order of **dharma** (理数)."

In the **Zhēnguàn** (贞观) seventeenth year, the Emperor decreed that **Lángsūn Wújì** (长孙无忌), **Fáng Xuánlíng** (房玄龄), **Lǐ Jì** (李绩), and **Chǔ Suìliáng** (褚遂良) draft a plan to designate **Jìnwáng Zhì** (晋王治) as the **imperial heir** (皇太子). At that time, a flock of flying pheasants numbering over ten gathered in the palace. The Emperor asked: *"What is this auspicious sign?"* **Suìliáng** replied: *"In the time of the Duke of Jin (晋文公), there was a **zhènzǐ** (振子) that transformed into a pheasant. The female cried at **Chéncāng** (陈仓), the male cried at **Nányáng** (南阳). The **zhènzǐ** said: 'He who obtains the male shall become king, he who obtains the female shall become a hegemon.' The Duke of Jin then sought the male among the feudal lords and established the **Bǎoxī** (宝鸡) shrine. Emperor Guangwu of the Han (汉光武) obtained the male, rose from **Nányáng**, and ruled over the Four Seas. Your Majesty was originally enfeoffed in **Qín** (秦), hence the appearance of both male and female pheasants—this is to proclaim Your Majesty’s enlightened **virtue** (德)."* The Emperor rejoiced and said: *"A person’s establishment in life cannot be without learning."* **Suìliáng** was indeed the kind of **scholar-official** (君子) who possessed broad knowledge.

The Emperor then appointed **Suìliáng** as **Tàizǐ Bīnkè** (太子宾客).

The *Record* states:
*"**Suìliáng** surely knew that **Jìnwáng Zhì**’s childhood name was **Jīnúnú** (雉奴). The gathering of flying pheasants was an omen for the **imperial heir** (太子). **Jìnwáng Zhì**, whose name was **Zhì**, had the childhood name **Jīnúnú** (雉奴)—how could he have been referring to **Qín** (秦) and Your Majesty’s enlightened **virtue** (德)? This was **heaven’s** (天) confirmation of trust, not requiring repeated commands to be believed.*

During the reign of **Empress Wu** (天后), **Emperor Ruizong** (睿宗) was the **imperial heir** (皇嗣). The ministers and officials rarely dared to hope for another audience, but **Tàicháng Gōngrén ān Jīnzàng** (太常工人安金藏), a **craftsman** (工人) under the **Tàicháng** (太常) office, managed to gain access. Soon after, a false accusation of treasonous plotting against the **imperial heir** arose. The Empress ordered **Lái Jiùnbīn** (来俊臣) to interrogate him, but the officials feared the **cruel tortures** (酷焰) and wished to extract a confession. **Jīnzàng** cried out loudly: *"You do not believe my words! Let me cut open my heart to prove that the **imperial heir** (皇嗣) has no treasonous intent!"* He drew his dagger and stabbed his abdomen, spilling his intestines onto the ground before collapsing in a faint. The Empress, hearing of this, was deeply shocked and had him carried to the **imperial palace** (禁中). The physicians stitched his intestines back inside, and he was supported with **mulberry paper** (桑楮) until evening, when he recovered. She then personally visited him, sighed, and said: *"I have sons who cannot prove their innocence, but none like your loyalty."* She immediately ordered the case to be dismissed, and **Ruizong** was spared. At that time, the officials of the court all praised him, saying none could surpass his loyalty.

During the **Jǐngyún** (景云) era, **Emperor Xuanzong** (玄宗) entrusted his affairs to the **historians** (史官) and ordered his name inscribed on the **Tàihuá Èrshān Bēi** (太华二山碑), a monument of honor. He was ultimately enshrined in the **temple courtyard** (庙庭) of **Ruizong**.

The *Record* states:
*"**Ān Jīnzàng** (安金藏) and **Léi Hǎiqīng** (雷海清) were both **craftsmen** (工人). One could uphold the profound **parent-child trust** (父子之信) even in the face of **severe tortures** (酷焰炎灼), while the other could endure the **agonizing pain of loyalty** (君臣之至痛) amid **tyrannical oppression** (凶虐滔天). To them, facing death was like returning home—this was their natural disposition."*

The **Dao** was severed yet revived, torn yet restored—his name carved upon the **Qín Huá** (秦华) monument, his honor enshrined in the imperial ancestral temple. Such deeds are rare in history, ancient or modern.

The *Song History* records:
**"Emperor Taizu** of the Song (宋太祖), surnamed **Zhào** (赵), given name **Kuāngyìn** (匡胤), had a father named **Hóngyìn** (弘殷), who held the titles of **Duke of Zhōu** (周检校司徒) and **Defense Commissioner of Yuè Prefecture** (岳州防御使). His mother, **Lady Dù** (杜氏), gave birth to Taizu in **Luòyáng’s Jiāmǎ Yíng** (洛阳夹马营). A crimson radiance filled the tent, and an unearthly fragrance lingered for days—men called him the **Fragrant Child** (香孩儿).

From the year **Emperor Míngzōng** of **Pòu Táng** (后唐明宗) ascended the throne, he would nightly burn incense in the palace and pray to Heaven: *'I, a mere Hu barbarian, seized power through chaos. I pray the Celestial will soon send a sage to rule as the people’s true sovereign.'* The following year, on a **Dīnghài** (丁亥) day, Taizu was born—fulfilling the prophecy.

As he grew, his bearing was majestic, his demeanor open and commanding. The wise knew he was no ordinary man.

The *Record* states:
According to the *History of the Five Dynasties*, when **moral order decayed** and **human bonds collapsed**, the very principle of **parental affection** was inverted—**arms rose against kin**, and **foreigners were adopted as sons**. In the fifty years spanning the **Kāipíng Xiǎndé** (开平显德) era, the **Five Dynasties** ruled China, yet truly eight lineages held sway, three of them rising from **beggars’ cradles**. Alas, how far had civilization fallen!

Yet Heaven, in its providence, bestowed upon the **Song Founder** a birth marked by omens, a mandate sealed in signs—**unplanned yet undeniable**, **self-evident in its truth**. Before this, **Emperor Shìzōng of Dà Dào** (后周世宗) once found in a document pouch a wooden tablet over three *chǐ* long, inscribed: *'Inspect and govern as the Son of Heaven.'* When the **Chénqiáo Uprising** (陈桥兵变) unfolded, he sent **Cǔ Zhāo Fú** (楚昭辅) to comfort his family in **Biànlǐng** (汴梁), who returned with the message: *'The Inspecting Officer has already ascended the throne.'* **Empress Dowager Dù** (杜太后) heard this and said: *'My son has always harbored grand ambitions—now they have come to pass.'*

The *Record* states:
Men wrongly took the Empress Dowager’s words as proof that Taizu had secretly harbored treasonous intent. How could this be? The **Inspecting Officer’s** destiny was already whispered throughout the empire long before—only now did she confirm its truth. Unlike **Emperor Táng Tàizōng**, who, when pressed, sighed: *'Today, I lose my family and life because of you. Tomorrow, I transform my house into a realm—also because of you.'* Thus, the Empress Dowager’s joy was grounded in evidence, while **Emperor Táng’s** words carried the weight of **coercion and brilliance**.

When the Empress Dowager fell ill, she urgently asked Taizu: *'Do you know how you came to possess the realm?'* Taizu, choked with emotion, could not answer. She pressed him again, and he replied: *'I, your subject, owe this realm to the accumulated blessings of my ancestors and Your Majesty.'* The Empress Dowager shook her head: *'No. It was because **Emperor Shìzōng of Dà Dào** entrusted the empire to a child that you now stand here. After your hundredth year, you must pass the throne to your younger brothers, **Guāngyì** (光义) and **Guāngměi** (光美), down to **Dé Zhāo** (德昭). A kingdom with a rightful heir is the nation’s greatest fortune.'* Taizu bowed his head to the ground: *'I dare not disobey.'* There, at her deathbed, he swore an oath, which she sealed with her imperial signet and entrusted to a **golden casket**, kept by the most trusted palace attendants.

The *Record* states:
The Empress Dowager’s single utterance thus bequeathed **two generations of peace**. Had such an oath been made in **early Táng**, how could the **Jīnyìng Palace massacre** (玄武门之变) have ever occurred?

Alas, petty men, driven by **greed and fear**, have distorted this **greatest of just principles**, omitting **Guāngměi and Dé Zhāo’s** rightful succession from the **veritable records**, consigning it instead to **frivolous tales**. Hence, the *Record* also omits **Zhào Pǔ** (赵普), for the deeds of the virtuous are beyond the comprehension of the common man.

When **Emperor Yīngzōng** (英宗) first ascended the throne, the **Empress Dowager** (皇太后) ruled alongside him. When the two palaces fell into discord, **Yáo Yù** (尧愈) dared to speak out, and the eunuchs **Rèn Shǒuzhōng** (任守忠) and others slandered him. Yáo Yù then submitted a memorial: *'The most trustworthy deeds in the world are: to entrust the realm to another, and to receive the realm from another. Today, the court needs only to purge these slanderers, and the voices of filial piety and loyalty will resound across the land.'* Thus, the eunuchs were banished, and the Empress Dowager restored full authority—mother and son once more in harmony.

The *Record* states:
**Yáo Yù’s** words were bold, and all at the time recognized their truth;
**The memorial’s** intent was subtle, yet few grasped its depth.
For discord arose from slander, slander from suspicion, suspicion from distrust—beginning with **trifling doubts**, ending with the **abandonment of the greatest grace**. Some may shatter a **thousand-gold ingot** yet cling to a **broken cauldron’s suspicion**. Only those of **golden and jade character** can speak and be believed.

Let the discerning examine this closely.

「Sun Chuan was a man of steadfast faith and strict adherence to law. He once addressed the throne, saying: *"The ancestral policies benefit the people; blood and law ensure the nation’s welfare. Since the reign of Emperor Shenzong, these policies have favored the wicked."* These were considered sound arguments at the time.

Later, when Emperor Qinzong sought refuge in the Jin camp, he left the Prince of Zhi (太子) to Sun Chuan as the acting regent (留守), also entrusting him with the office of Minor Transmission (少传). The Jin demanded the Prince again, but Sun Chuan refused to send him, secretly plotting to conceal him. Instead, he ordered the execution of men resembling the Prince in appearance, sending their heads to the Jin camp with the claim: *"The eunuchs sought to steal the Prince and deliver him to the military camp. The people of the capital resisted and killed them, mistakenly harming the Prince. Thus, the military has been dispatched to quell this rebellion and present the head."* If this was not enough, he added: *"If they persist, I will follow with my own death."* After five days, no one dared to take up the matter. Fu Bi, bearing the grief of the Prince’s death, declared: *"I am the Prince’s attendant; by duty, I must die with him."* Lu Shu, though not summoned by the Jin, said: *"I will go with him."* At the time, Sun Chuan was staying in the Imperial City (皇城司), and his son came to visit. He scolded him, saying: *"If you had not come, I would have already divided my death with the country to preserve my integrity. Your coming serves no purpose."* He waved his son away urgently. The son wept, saying: *"Your honor has sacrificed your life for the country; what more is there to say?"* Sun Chuan then entrusted the regency to Wang Shiyong and departed.

The *Record* states:
*"Many officials faced death in this crisis, yet only one dared to stand alone—Fu Bi. Fortunately, the Prince of Kang (康王) remained. If Heaven does not abandon us, the Song will not perish. However, since no one dared to take up the matter, Heaven’s revulsion against deceit and treachery has reached its limit. If the old ways were discarded and new ones established to revive the legacy of the Founding Ancestor (艺祖), then the succession of the rebellious (绍迷) would be extinguished. With the rebellious succession diminished, the policies favoring the wicked would also cease."*

Empress Dowager Wei, originally the Consort of Virtue (贤妃), accompanied the Emperor Huizong (上皇) on his northern migration. In the early years of Emperor Gaozong’s reign (建炎初), she was pressured to be honored as the Empress Dowager of Emperor Qinzong (宣和皇后), later elevated to the title of Grand Empress Dowager (皇太后). The Emperor once wept and instructed his ministers, saying: *"The Grand Empress Dowager’s years are advanced; I cannot rest without thinking of her. I have the realm, yet I cannot provide for my own kin. You must swear in earnest: if I return the Grand Empress Dowager to you, I will not be ashamed of reconciliation. If not, I will not hesitate to use force."* Just then, the Jin sent Xiao Yi (萧毅) to negotiate peace, and the Emperor again spoke to him, saying: *"If the Grand Empress Dowager truly returns, I will strictly uphold the oath. If she does not, even with an oath, it is but empty words."* When he ordered He Zhi (何铸) and Cao Xun (曹勋) to express gratitude, he summoned them to the inner palace and said: *"Gazing northward toward my home, I have no tears left to shed. When you see the Jin ruler, tell him: ‘My maternal kin in the northern realm are but an old man. In my own realm, they hold great weight. Speak to him with utmost sincerity, and perhaps he will be moved.’"* He Zhi and the others repeatedly pleaded in the Jin court, and the Jin ruler finally agreed.

The *Record* states:
*"The Emperor’s true intentions were fully revealed here. Though he demanded the return of the two Saints (二圣) and the recovery of the Central Plains (中原) with countless words, it all boiled down to one principle. Why? Because love is singular, gain and loss are twofold, and benefit and harm are threefold. These three things stem from his heart, and no one can alter them. Men see only that their fathers begot them, yet they do not know that thirty-one persons share the same fate as one child and one mother—who is closer? And if one loses the warm affection of a parent or elder, though their flesh may still be connected, how deeply does it cut? If the father and elder still lived, they would merely hold the title of king. Compared to the Father Heaven and Mother Earth, who grasp the *Dao* (乾) and tread the *Qi* (坤), whose subjects number countless myriads and whose commands sway the armies of the world—who is more worthy? The capital’s recovery is but a return to the south. Compared to laughing in defiance of mountains and lakes, free from peril and obstruction, where the southerners remain in the south and the northerners in the north—who gains more? Even if the kin are as close as enemies, they will not be spared. This is because they lack the singular loyalty that all others share. This is the Emperor’s true heart, clear as a mirror. How could anyone take it from him?*

*Thus, the virtuous value the expansion of the Four Cardinal Virtues (四端)—do not allow any one of them to be obscured. And they say: *If one can fully embody them, it is enough to preserve the Four Seas. If not, it is not enough even to protect one’s own wife and children.* These words seem made for the Emperor himself, proving that the wisdom of the sages was already settled long ago. How could later generations’ endless speeches ever rival it?"*

On the birthday of the Empress Dowager of Longyou (隆佑太后), a banquet was held in the palace. The Empress wept and said to Emperor Gaozong: *"I am old now, with deep regrets. Speak them for me to the sovereign."* She continued: *"I served under Empress Dowager Rongren (宣仁); she was a sage and virtuous mother, her wisdom unmatched in ancient or modern times. In the past, wicked ministers spread slander and false accusations. Even in the early years of the reign of Emperor Qinzong (建炎初), though decrees were issued to clarify the truth, the official histories had not yet been revised. How could this suffice to convey my intentions? The spirits of the two Empresses in Heaven still hope for your justice, O Emperor."*

Emperor Gaozong was deeply moved and ordered the revision of the histories. The *Record* states:
*"Empress Dowager Rongren’s knowledge of Empress Dowager Longyou was as steadfast as pine and cypress in winter’s chill, unchanging even in adversity. Empress Dowager Longyou’s favor toward Empress Dowager Rongren was as inevitable as the spring thaw, where snow cannot linger. With such a woman, how could one not repay such a mother? This is Heaven’s comfort to one old soul, allowing her to guard our dynasty. Alas! In life, she was called the ‘female Yao and Shun’ (女中尧舜), yet in death, she was slandered. The crimes of Empress Dowager Rongren and Empress Dowager Du (惇) are too grievous to recount. The histories written in black and red ink are lamentably late in coming. The Fan family, from Fan Zheng (范镇) to Fan Yu (祖禹), served three generations in the Forbidden City (禁林), earning the admiration of scholars. During the Yuanyou era (元佑中), Fan Yu revised the *Real Record* (实录) of Emperor Shenzong, heavily criticizing Wang Anshi’s faults. Wang Anshi’s son-in-law, Cai Bian (蔡卞), hated this, and Fan Yu was exiled and died in the Lingbiao Mountains (岭表). Now, Emperor Gaozong urgently commands the revision of the *Real Records* of the two reigns of Shenzong and Zhezong (神哲两朝实录), summoning Fan Yu’s son, Fan Chong (冲), to serve as the Minor Assistant of the Bureau of Ancestral Sacrifices (宗正少卿), and concurrently as the Deputy Director of the History Bureau (兼直史馆)."»

The Emperor said to him: *"The great records of the two reigns have all been corrupted by deceitful ministers, hence I entrust them to you."*

Fan Chong composed *Considerations on Differences* (《考异》), clearly marking what was retained, what was deleted (in yellow ink), and what was newly added (in red ink), earning the name *Jumu History* (朱墨史). He also wrote *Defending Zhezong Against False Accusations* (《辩诬录》), thereby restoring the truth of both histories and exposing the true nature of the deceitful ministers even more clearly.

Before this, when Empress Dowager Xuanren passed away, the court and the people mourned deeply, yet none dared speak out. Fan Chong submitted a memorial stating:

*"Your Majesty now governs all affairs and receives the ministers. This is the foundation of the state’s prosperity or decline, the pivot of the dynasty’s safety or peril, the source of the people’s joy or suffering, and the moment when the worthy and unworthy rise or fall, when Heaven’s mandate and human hearts converge or diverge. How can this be taken lightly?

The Empress Dowager had great merit for the dynasty and great virtue for the people, remaining steadfast for nine years. Yet the scheming ministers harbored resentment, and they will surely seek to alter the policies of the late Emperor and drive away his ministers, using false accusations to sow discord. This must be carefully examined.

The Empress Dowager adapted to the changing hearts of the people—these ministers betrayed the late Emperor above and the people below. They are the very ones the realm despises and seeks to remove. How could the Empress Dowager have hated them?

Only by clarifying right and wrong, firmly rejecting false doctrines, and punishing those who deceive with the law—severely punishing one to deter others—can harmony be restored without further incident."*

He further said: *"The Empress Dowager governed with absolute impartiality, abolishing Wang Anshi and Sima Guang’s new policies and restoring the old ways of the ancestors. Thus, the dynasty was saved from peril and the people’s divisions healed, even to the point where the Liao ruler warned his ministers not to provoke conflict. If the barbarians’ sentiments are thus, how much more so the hearts of the Chinese people!

The Empress Dowager toiled night and day to establish a foundation of peace for Your Majesty. I pray that you govern with humility and act with an open mind, so that the loyalty and disloyalty of your ministers and the right and wrong of all matters may be clearly known to Your Majesty."*

His memorials went unanswered, and only now did the Emperor believe his words.

The record states: *"I observe the Jumu History—not only a blessing for the Empress Dowager, but also for the Fan family. His father was exiled and died for his honest *Real Record*, while his son now corrected the falsehoods, clarified the truth, and recorded it, so that the affairs of that time, long shrouded in darkness, were restored to light. Within one family, it was as if embers had been fanned back to flame.

This shows that Heaven’s principle and human conscience are indeed worthy of trust, and that right and wrong, though obscured in the moment, will shine clearly for ten thousand generations. How can one content themselves with the fleeting present and abandon the eternal future?"*

Chen Qun served as Left Secretary and temporarily as Censor-in-Chief. Once, Zeng Bu sent a messenger to persuade him to accept an imminent promotion. Chen Qun told his son, Chen Zhengui: *"I have disagreed with the Chancellor on matters of governance. If I accept his favor now, and later we differ again, I would be shamed by both public opinion and private gratitude. I have written a letter exposing his faults and will send it to urge him to resign. But his influence is vast.

If he cannot tolerate me, his favor will not extend to you. Can you bear this in your heart?"*

Chen Zhengui wished to see the letter and deliver it to Zeng Bu, who flew into a rage and had him dismissed, exiled to Yuanzhou. While in Hangzhou, Zhengui reported that Cai Jing was plotting against the Eastern Palace, so he was arrested and sent to Kaifeng Prison, where Chen Qun was also imprisoned. The jailer, Yin Li, forced him to falsely accuse his son. Chen Qun replied: *"Zhengui heard rumors that Cai Jing intended harm to the state and spread them on the streets. How could I have known? To betray filial piety for personal gain and falsely accuse my son is something I cannot bear. To fabricate evidence out of private resentment is also against my conscience.

Cai Jing’s treachery will surely bring ruin to the state—I have already spoken against him in the Hall of State Petitions and the Censorate, and it is not as if I am speaking now for the first time."*

The eunuch overseer, Huang Jingcheng, interrogating him, said: *"The Emperor merely seeks the truth. You should answer as you spoke."*

Chen Qun had previously written *The Collection in Honor of Yao* (《尊尧集》), stating: *"During the Shaoshing era, the historians relied solely on Wang Anshi’s daily records to rewrite Emperor Shenzong’s history, distorting right and wrong and making it untrustworthy. I have investigated and exposed the falsehoods to uphold the duty of ruler and subject."*

Now, the Chancellor ordered a brutal executioner, Shi, to bring Chen Qun to court, where he laid out the charges and threatened him with death. Chen Qun, sensing their intent, shouted: *"Is this by imperial decree?"*

The executioner then said: *"The court commands you to revere *The Collection in Honor of Yao*."*

Chen Qun replied: *"Then why all this? Do you know why it is called *The Collection in Honor of Yao*? It is because it upholds the divine teaching of Yao and treats the Emperor as Shun. How can revering Yao be a crime?"*

The Chancellor, whose learning was shallow and who had been deceived by others, asked: *"What have you gained from public opinion? Do you not fear it?"*

The executioner withdrew in shame.

The record states: *"Fan Chong’s revisions span the Southern and Northern dynasties, while Chen Qun’s writings were contemporary with Cai Jing and Cai Bian. Yet the state histories may be altered, but human hearts cannot; the halls of power may be neglected, but the common people cannot. The tyranny of a single era may be feared, but the verdict of ten thousand generations cannot be erased.

What the virtuous trust is only this: that a father believes his son and sends a letter to urge him to resign, while the son believes his father and exposes his crimes to correct them. He would rather defy familial favor than betray his father, and rather endure false accusation than falsely accuse his son."*

The executioner withdrew in shame.

The record states: *"Fan Chong’s revisions span the Southern and Northern dynasties, while Chen Qun’s writings were contemporary with Cai Jing and Cai Bian. Yet the state histories may be altered, but human hearts cannot; the halls of power may be neglected, but the common people cannot. The tyranny of a single era may be feared, but the verdict of ten thousand generations cannot be erased. What the virtuous trust is only this: that a father believes his son and sends a letter to urge him to resign, while the son believes his father and exposes his crimes to correct them. He would rather defy familial favor than betray his father, and rather endure false accusation than falsely accuse his son."*

This is indeed the utmost of human sentiment, yet truly the glory of the realm and the state. Thus, when recording his deeds, Fan Chong felt no shame.

Zhao □, having moved from Chaozhou to Jiyang Military District, his son Fan Cheng had already served in his retinue. The father did not permit him to accompany him on that day. In the early years of the *Shàoshèng* era (1094–1100), Lü Dàfáng was exiled to Lingnan, and only his son Lü Jǐngshān loved him, refusing to let him go alone, though Lü Jǐngshān insisted on following.

Upon arriving at his destination, as he prepared to cross the mountains, Lü turned to his son, weeping: *"I am old, and death is of no consequence to me. You are young—what crime have you committed that you must die with me in this malarial land? If I die first, you may return in mourning and still have descendants of me."* Thus, he drank to excess and died.

I did not command you to accompany me, but this was Lü’s own intention. When Fan Cheng arrived, he secretly lived in secluded places, and neither his disciples nor former officials dared to communicate with him. Later, an imperial edict was issued to the local military district, requiring monthly reports on his life and death. At this point, Fan Cheng called his son to him once more and said: *"If Qie (Zhao □) insists on killing me, I will not let his misfortune extend to our entire family. I have already inscribed my epitaph and removed the date of my birth, adding instead: ‘My body rides the *Jīwěi* constellation back to the heavens, my *qi* becomes the grandeur of mountains and rivers, aiding our dynasty.’"* Then, he refused food and died. Fan Cheng escorted his remains back home.

The local governor, Zhāng Jié, knew that Fan Chong’s correspondence with officials across the empire had been intercepted during his funeral, and that the documents would be a valuable commodity. He quickly dispatched soldiers from the lower county under the pretext of searching for illicitly brewed wine, rushing to seize the letters hidden behind the walls of the county magistrate Wēng Méng’s residence. Wēng Méng, pursued from behind, hurriedly delivered them, and Fan Cheng promptly burned all the documents in the basket, including the writing knives and tools. By the time the officials arrived, nothing remained.

Qie’s resentment was not yet satisfied, so he persuaded the *Censorate* official Xú Jiā to accuse Fan Cheng of conspiring with the royal family—specifically, the official Zhī Quán of Quanzhou—over lavish farewell feasts and excessive drinking, implying treasonous intent. Fan Cheng was sent to the *Dàlǐ* (Supreme Court) prison, compelled to falsely implicate himself in a plot of great treason alongside figures such as Zhāng Jùn, Lǐ Guāng, Hú Yín, and Hú Chuán, totaling fifty-three people. The case was concluded, but Qie fell ill and could not write his own testimony, so Fan Cheng was released.

As for the words between a father and son, none were untrue.

The record states: *"In my view, Fan Chong’s final words—could they truly be trusted?"*

Mencius said: *"As for his **qi**—it was of the utmost grandeur and firmness. If he nourished it uprightly without harm, then it would have filled the space between heaven and earth. Even heaven and earth could be filled, yet mountains and rivers alone could not have made him mighty. Alas, he failed to accept its rectitude! Death is the supreme fate of man. To be bound in chains and imprisoned in a dungeon, or to be cast into cliffs, walls, ditches, and filthy sewers—what matters is how I face my own death. If he had been treated justly, then even being bound in chains would not be a crime, and being imprisoned in a dungeon would not be a disgrace. But if he had not been treated justly, then his fate would be equal to that of cliffs, walls, ditches, and sewers. Why then did he insist on refusing to eat the flesh of the dead?*

*The home is an external thing, easily obtained; the body is within oneself, hard to preserve. Rather than grieve for my one family, I would prefer to lament my one body. Though Qie’s tyranny was dreadful, my life still remained—how could I not fear being captured like Zhang Jie, or ending up in Qie’s prison?*

*Or was it that Master Zhong and the dull-witted were merely sparing their children, yet they did not compare to Tian Hua’s censure of Zou Hao—could it be that they grew old and gained wisdom? No! Even if one indulges in drinking or remains pure, it is not possible to bring the dead back to life outside the regions of Linghai (southern China)."*

*The **Imperial Collection of Writings** states: In the 11th year of Hongwu (1378), the emperor commanded Jiangyin Marquis Huo Liang to oversee the construction of a new imperial ancestral hall. At the time, the Taizu Emperor (Hongwu) believed that the inscriptions on the ancestral tombstones, all written by Confucian scholars, might not suffice to convey his true legacy. Thus, he personally recorded his struggles and the blessings of Ming prosperity, so that future generations might witness them and have no doubts.*

*His words were as follows:*

*"In the past, my father the emperor resided here, toiling morn and night in hardship, wandering in search of sustenance. Soon, calamities struck, and his kin suffered misfortune. My father died at sixty-four, my mother at fifty-nine. The ancestral spirit had nowhere to rest, and his noble resolve was cast adrift like a gallant roaming without purpose. His body was driven like a tumbleweed by the wind, never ceasing; his heart seethed like boiling water. He was but a lone cloud amid three years of turmoil, yet by the age of twenty, he was already strong.*

*At that time, bandits rose along the Huai River, and the people lived in chaos. Later, he returned to his ancestral duties, but within three years, mighty rivals emerged. First, they struck at Ruyang and Yuzhou; then, they moved south to Fenyang’s outer precincts. I led my troops, guiding my horses and controlling the reins, venturing into the southern lands. My **qi** expanded and shone brightly, rallying farmers to join my ranks. This was my mission to restore order, and within a month, my forces swelled, their red banners covering the fields and filling the hills. I led the waves of the clear river, garrisoned at Suiyang, and yearned for my kin in their old homes. All day long, I spoke with passion and resolve, driving the rival warlords onward. My meals were hurried, and I briefly defended Hezhou. Crossing the great river to the east, I first pacified Gusou (modern Suzhou), upholding proper rites. Thus, I established my base in Jianye (Nanjing).*

*I held the four passes, sharpened my weapons, and fed my horses, calmly observing the treacherous and the obstinate. I personally led campaigns into Jingchu (modern Hubei and Hunan), intending to subdue the lakes and rivers of Hunan. The Three Miao tribes surrendered, and the southern seas grew strong.*

*I commanded the great general, Huo Liang, to march through Qilu (modern Shandong and Henan), his banners gleaming. To the west, I had the regions of Yilu (modern Henan), Qinling, and the narrow passes of Hengshan—territories where the rivers were perilous and the land treacherous. When I entered the barbarian capital, the markets did not even dare to close. The fierce warlords displayed their weapons, yet they shone like stars in the sky. Later, I advanced along the Jingdian (modern Jiangsu and Shandong) route, and all the people within and beyond the rivers and mountains looked up to me in awe.*

*Once the Central Plains were pacified, the streets resounded with festive music. The lands of Xuanbo (modern Korea) and Yuelang (modern Liaoning) submitted their records, and the thirteen southern vassal states came to pay homage. I leaned upon Jinling (Nanjing) to establish my throne, relying on the tiger’s crouch and the phoenix’s perch. The stars hung high, the moon cast its radiance upon the vast seas, and the Zhongshan (Purple Mountain) range stood firm, its peaks meeting at the Silver Gully.*

*I wished to bestow a modest burial upon my ancestors, but the diviner said: ‘The earth here is unsuitable; they must be buried elsewhere.’ The rites of the ancestral sacrifices were already established, and each time I offered pure and refined sacrifices, I reflected upon my labors and the boundless grace that could never be fully repaid. Thus, I inscribed these words upon the imperial ancestral hall: ‘May future generations uphold the Mandate of Heaven and cultivate virtue, so that they might always come to honor and feast upon me.’*

*The record states: ‘I humbly read the imperial words on the ancestral tombstones. Not only did they reveal the hardships and blessings of prosperity, but they also contained profound meanings that must not be overlooked. The ancestral hall’s location was not chosen arbitrarily; it was a matter of necessity. Now, though he is already the Son of Heaven, possessing all under heaven, even if he were to alter it, what could not be done? Yet, he knew that wise men understand what is yet to come, rather than merely what has already happened. The earth’s **Dao** is vast, yet distant and hard to discern, while human affairs are plain to see. Though the ancestral spirits are subtle and hard to measure, their deeds are known. Before the burial of the imperial ancestors, the Jiangbei region was but a commoner’s dwelling. Thus, the sagacious pen recorded what was yet to be. After the burial of the imperial ancestors, the Huai River region became a true dragon’s domain. Thus, the divine achievements were as they should be. Should one not inquire into their reasons?*

*To strive and then succeed, to seek and then obtain—this is human, not divine. To act without intent, to cause without purpose—this is divine, not human. The Great King’s migration to Qi (modern Shanxi) led to his descendants ruling the land for three generations; yet, even the sages still regard it as a fortunate turn of fate, occurring after his body had been cast aside. Moreover, the earth’s **Dao** takes tranquility as its foundation, and the ancestral spirits seek peace above all. The dragon’s **qi** lies hidden, not dependent on whether the burial mound is small or grand. The gathering of blessings and virtue does not hinge on whether the location is distant or near. If one opposes human schemes here and defies the **Dao** of heaven, then even if the ruler possesses the power to create life, the earth’s **Dao** will rarely grant peace and tranquility. Though the ruler’s heart may be filled with utmost reverence, the ancestral spirits cannot be free from the fear of disturbance. Comparing this to that, who gains and who loses?*

*Though the words of the sage-ancestor were written with a straightforward pen, their meaning was profound and far-reaching. May the sacred descendants of all future generations uphold and believe in them, never letting them be forgotten.’*

*The **Record of Distinguished Officials** states: *"Nee Minister Wuyue (倪尚书岳) served in both capitals and the four ministries, eventually rising to the position of Grand Tutor to the Crown Prince."*

「Furthermore, Wen Xi Gong (文僖公) was also a minister of virtue and humility, serving as the Vice-Minister of the Imperial Sacrifices Department in the Southern Capital (南京礼部尚书). His mother, Lady Yao (夫人姚氏), was of noble lineage.

Initially, when Wen Xi Gong was commissioned to perform the ritual of succession for the Northern Peak (北岳), Lady Yao dreamed of a divine figure in flowing robes (徘袍神人) entering the chamber. Upon waking, she gave birth to the minister, believing it was due to the influence of the Northern Peak’s sacred **Dao** (岳柙所感). Thus, she named him **Yue** (岳).

As he grew older, his physique was robust and imposing, with piercing, radiant eyes (目光炯炯). Simply by looking at him, one could perceive his divine aura (真若神人). Both father and son were appointed as scholars (学士), with the father known as Wen (文), and the son’s works—*The Green Creek Herbs* (*青溪草*) and *The Collected Works of Wen Xi* (*文僖集*)—circulated together in the world, rare treasures indeed.

Later, when afflicted by illness, he still personally inscribed the *Recommended for Verification* (*荐真*) text. As death approached, he insisted on writing with his own hand. Throughout his life, he was upright and impartial, yet in his final words, he spoke not of family matters but only of matters of **virtue/power** (福德).

Such was his integrity—whether living or dead—far surpassing the ordinary mourners who merely weep in passing.

Minister Wen of the Han (韩尚书文), descended from the Wei Duke (魏公) of the Song Dynasty, hailed from the lineage of the ancient Xia Dynasty’s Wen Tang Gong (文汤公).

At the time of Wen Xi Gong’s birth, his mother dreamed of a man in purple robes (紫衣人) telling her: *"I am the one who delivered Wen Tang Gong to you."* Hence, she named him **Wen** (文), and later, he rose to the position of Grand Tutor to the Crown Prince (太子太保).

In the early years of the Jiaqing era (嘉靖初), he was honored with a posthumous edict of praise and inquiry. Among the words spoken were: *"Though you endured the usurpation of power by corrupt officials and lamented the chaotic governance of the realm, you upheld righteousness without favor, pledging your loyalty to the end. You spoke out against danger with resolute words, unshaken like mountains and rivers (屹乎山岳之难摇). You embraced misfortune to forget your own family, remaining steadfast as ice and snow (凛尔冰霜之不变). The world admired your bearing, and the divine spirits blessed your longevity (寿康).

You revived Wen Yianbo (文彦博) from his ninefold mourning, and the people’s hearts turned to you in trust. You succeeded the Han Wei Duke (韩魏公), and his family’s blessings grew ever more manifest. None could doubt your sincerity."*

The Record states: *"The deeds of these two ministers were not mere chance but the inevitable result of their nature. They were born as great figures of their age, not by coincidence. Thus, they are recorded."*

The *Record of the Upholding of the Dao* (弘道录) concludes its **Volume Fifty-Two** and begins **Volume Fifty-Three** with the entry: *"The Faith of Husbands and Wives"* (夫妇之信).

The *Yao De* (尧典) states: *"Let me test him."*

At that time, Yao observed the conduct of Shun through his two daughters. The Record says: *"I observe Yao’s testing of Shun—not only in what he urged him to do, but also in what he overlooked. What he urged was in their formal morning audiences; what he overlooked were the casual conversations at the hearth. Thus, the two daughters, though dwelling together, had differing intentions—a common human trait. But when he observed Shun through his few wives, extending even to his brothers, because they were close to his household, this was the unique insight of the Sage. Yet how must he have acted before Yao could truly call him tested? He must have shown mutual respect like honored guests, and thus virtue and propriety arose; he must have maintained proper distinctions of rank, and thus harmony between superiors and inferiors was achieved; he must have upheld firmness and gentleness without disorder, and thus the wife’s caution was kept at a distance; he must have moved and remained still without contradiction, and thus inner and outer harmony prevailed. These were the profound *virtues/powers* (玄德) that ascended to Yao’s ears—what appeared as nothing but the unseen reality of his *temperate and respectful demeanor* (温恭允塞), which in truth was the subtle essence of *self-discipline and reverence* (戒谨恐惧). Who would say that Yao’s governance did not originate from this very foundation of *caution and solitude* (慎独)? If not so, how could Shun have been deemed worthy of succession each day?"*

Five households were thus tested.

The *Book of Odes* (《诗》) speaks of the *Southern States* (南国):

*"The influence of King Wen!*
*There were women who could maintain their chastity and sincerity (贞信) against violence and oppression (强暴),*
*and yet they would declare their own resolve,*

*The record says: ‘Why does this woman thus shine?’*
*She replied: ‘My younger sister delayed her return,*
*and there was a time for her delay.’*
*Confucius said: ‘Ah, ah! She waits for her worth to be recognized!*
*This woman, though fair as *Tao* (桃) and *Ying* (夭), yet does not adorn herself,*

*Zhuāng Jiāng* (庄姜) was beautiful yet childless,*
*and so she took *Dài Mǎ* (戴妈) of *Chén* (陈) as her own son,*
*the child of *Wán* (完) who had been given to her.*
*When *Zhuāng Gōng* (庄公) died,*
*Wán ascended the throne,*
*but *Zhuāng Jiāng’s* son *Zhōu Yú* (州吁) assassinated him,*
*so *Dài Mǎ* returned to *Chén* in great disgrace,*
*and *Zhuāng Jiāng* composed verses to send her off:*
*'The *Zhōng* (仲) clan’s duty is clear,*
*their hearts deep as the *Yuān* (渊) abyss,*
*yet they remain warm and kind,*
*refined and cautious in their conduct.*

*‘In memory of my former lord,*
*I exhort the one left behind.’*

*The record says:*
*The *I Ching* (《易》) in its *Gūi Mèi* (归妹) hexagram states: ‘The dim-sighted can see.’*
*Though *Dài Mǎ* was virtuous (贤),*
*she endured *Zhuāng Gōng’s* cruelty (暴),*
*and yet the self-aware observe her—*
*one might almost wish to pluck out the blindfold from her eyes!*
*Yet she still bore the thought of her former lord,*
*and where is the cruelty now?’*

*‘It benefits the secluded to maintain their chastity.’*
*Though *Zhuāng Jiāng* was without favor,*
*she faced *Zhōu Yú’s* usurpation (篡逆),*
*and yet people did not abandon her,*
*as if overturning a stool to gnaw at its legs—*
*yet she still held her position as a minor lord (小君),*
*and where is the usurpation now?’*

*Thus it is known:*
*Chastity (贞) can rectify (格) the heavens,*
*and compliance (顺) can win the people.*

*The *I Ching* (《易》) has ‘*Xìn* (信) and *Tún* (豚鱼),*
*and the *Book of Odes* (《诗》) has ‘*My heart is not stone* (我心匪石),*
*illuminating chastity and compliance (昭贞顺).’*

*The *Shì* (世子) of *Wèi* (卫), *Gòng Bó* (共伯), died young,*
*and his wife *Gòng Jiāng* (共姜) upheld righteousness (义).*
*Her parents wished to take her and remarry her,*
*so *Gòng Jiāng* composed verses to swear her resolve:*
*'She drifts upon the paired boat,*
*on the central stream.*
*Her hair is shorn, two locks remain—*
*this is my solemn vow.*

*‘My oath to the dead is unaltered,*
*my parents, though stern, do not sway me,*
*and I will not heed the words of others.’*"*

「The records state:
Chastity (贞) harmonizes with Heaven (天), yet if a person does not follow it, one can discern their nature.
*Sincerity* (信) aligns with the spirits (鬼), but if a father does not uphold it, one can perceive the father’s true character.

Indeed, the outward form and blood-flesh that may be shared by others—this is humanity (人), and humanity is easy to observe.
Yet the resonance of resolve and *qi* (志气) that Heaven responds to—this is Heaven, and Heaven is difficult to comprehend.

Thus it was fitting that her parents sought to take her and remarry her.

*The Biographies of Exemplary Women* (《列女传》) recounts: **Zhēn Jiāng** (贞姜) was the wife of King Zhāo of Chu (楚昭王).
When the king went on a journey, he left his wife on the **Jiān Tái** (渐台) terrace.
As the river waters surged violently, the king heard of it and sent an attendant to fetch his wife.
Yet the attendant forgot to bring the royal seal (符), so when he arrived, the wife said:
‘The king and I made an agreement: if he summons me, he must bring the seal.
Now that the seal is not brought, I dare not follow.’

The attendant replied:
‘The waters are now surging violently; if we return to fetch the seal, we may be too late.’

The wife said:
‘I have heard that the duty of a chaste woman (贞女) is to uphold her resolve (义), never breaking an agreement, and to remain steadfast (守一) in one path.’

Thus, the attendant went back to retrieve the seal, but by the time he returned, the waters had overwhelmed the terrace, and the wife was swept away and died.

The records state:
A virtuous woman (妇人) remains steadfast until death (从一而终).
“Steadfast” (一) does not necessarily mean one person—it may refer to a single principle, a single virtue, or a single vow of sincerity (一约一信).
The king had agreed to bring the seal; when the seal did not arrive, her life was forfeit—why then did he not trust her resolve?

Thus, her death or survival depended on whether he forgot or did not forget.
This is why a *junzi* (君子) holds fast to sincerity and diligently studies the Dao/Way (善道), guarding their life with virtue (守死善道).
If one could be summoned or abandoned at will, how could they be called a *junzi*?

*The Book of Han* (《汉书》) recounts: Lǚ Gōng (吕公), the father of Empress Lǚ, was skilled in divining human fortune (相人).
Seeing the appearance of the High Ancestor (高祖), he revered and trusted him, saying:
‘I have divined many people, but none like this man (季).
I hope he will take care of himself.
I have a daughter, whom I entrust to him as a match for **Jī Chóu** (箕筹).’

Lǚ’s mother, angry, said:
‘The two gentlemen initially praised this girl, saying she would marry a nobleman (贵人).
Yet the magistrate of Péi (沛令), Shàn Gōng (善公), sought her but was refused—why did you rashly promise her to him?’

Lǚ Gōng replied:
‘This is not something a child or woman can understand.’

He ultimately gave his daughter to the High Ancestor, who became Empress Lǚ, bearing the Prince of Huì (惠帝) and Princess Lǚyuán of Lǔ (鲁元公主).

Once, while Empress Lǚ was in the fields with her two sons, an old man passed by and asked for water.
Empress Lǚ offered it to him.
The old man divined her fate (相后), saying:
‘Madam, you are a noble one destined for greatness (天下贵人).
Seeing the younger son, he said:
‘The reason Madam will ascend is because of this boy.’

After the old man left, the High Ancestor happened to come from a nearby dwelling.
Empress Lǚ told him everything.
The High Ancestor then pursued the old man, who said again:
‘Your son and the son of Madam will both become kings (君).
The king’s fortune is too noble to speak of.’

The High Ancestor thanked him, saying:
‘Truly as you say, I dare not forget this virtue/power (德).’

In the Later Han (后汉), during the reign of Emperor Hépíng (和熹), Empress Dēng (邓皇后) was the granddaughter of the Grand Tutor Yǔ (太傅禹), whose father was Xùn (训) and mother was Lady Yīn (阴氏).
Empress Guāngliè (光烈皇后) was her younger sister.

Empress Dēng once dreamed of a vast, swaying sky, its azure expanse like a bell-shaped breast (锺乳状).
She gazed upward and drank from it, and when she consulted the dream diviners (占梦), they said it was an auspicious omen beyond words.

Her maternal uncle, Shàn Cháng (陕常), was a towering figure (一高).
He said:
‘I have heard that one who saves a thousand lives will have descendants who receive noble titles (封).’

Her elder brother, Xùn, as a **Yèzhě** (谒者) in charge of palace seals, carved an inscription on a stone:
‘The Yellow River annually saves thousands of lives—Heaven’s decree is trustworthy, and this family will surely prosper.’

The Grand Tutor Yǔ also sighed:
‘Five mouths sustain a hundred thousand souls, yet he has never wrongly taken a single life.
His descendants will surely be blessed with fortune.’

To this point, Empress Dēng was selected to enter the palace as a **guìrén** (贵人).」

When Empress Yin grew increasingly distant, seeing the empress’s favor and grace flourish, she resorted to witchcraft and curses, hoping to harm her. At that time, the emperor fell gravely ill again.

Empress Yin secretly declared, *“Now that I am in favor, I will ensure no remnant of the Deng family remains.”*

Upon hearing this, Empress Deng wept before her attendants and said, *“I have served the empress with utmost sincerity, yet she does not even grant me protection. I willingly pledge my life to this oath.”* She then sought to take poison, but the palace woman Zhao Yu firmly restrained her. The prince (弘) urgently reported that the emperor’s illness had already abated, and the empress believed him.

The next day, the emperor indeed recovered.

Empress Yin was deposed for her use of witchcraft, and the emperor, moved by pity, declared to his officials, *“The noble virtue of the Deng guiren surpasses all in the palace—she should be elevated as a brother’s wife.”* Thus, she was made empress.

**Recorded:** The rise of emperors and kings is always bound by Heaven’s decree. The two empresses, both contending for supreme authority and ruling in the emperor’s stead, thus met with swift divine omens—far beyond the fleeting favor of the inner court. Ultimately, their rivalry revealed the extraordinary virtue of the inner consort, further strengthening the emperor’s original resolve, while the treacherous schemes of the outer court only served to elevate the Deng clan. Heaven’s will is indeed trustworthy.

**The Filial Wife of Chen (陈孝妇):**
At sixteen, she was married and bore no children. When her husband was conscripted for military service, he entrusted her, *“My life may not return, but I have an aged mother with no other relatives to care for her. If I do not return, will you nourish her?”*

She replied, *“I will.”*

Her husband died and never returned. Yet the wife never faltered in caring for her mother-in-law. Her own parents, pitying her youth and childlessness, sought to remarry her.

The wife said, *“I have heard that trust is the foundation of one’s reputation, and righteousness the measure of one’s conduct. To abandon a dependent without fulfilling my vow, to betray a dead man’s trust—this is unrighteous. Better to die upholding virtue than to live dishonoring it. And if I fail to complete the care of an elderly mother, or break a promise made to another, how then shall I establish myself in the world?”*

She attempted suicide, but her parents, fearing for her, compelled her to continue tending her mother-in-law until her death. Thereafter, she faithfully maintained the ancestral sacrifices.

The governor of Huaiyang reported her deeds, and Emperor Wen praised her virtue and integrity, sending an envoy to bestow forty pounds of gold and grant her lifelong exemption from taxes.

**Recorded:** Death is the fate of all, but without trust, humanity cannot stand. This filial wife was but a soldier’s spouse, yet from the Han to this day, her story has endured for nearly a thousand years. Without virtue and integrity, would she not have rotted like grass and wood? The fleeting glory of a moment is slight, but the enduring treasure of a thousand ages is weighty.

Alas! Even today, commoners still speak of betraying their lords, breaking their own vows, and violating others’ agreements—as the *Odes* censure: *“Their words are hollow, their speech as drunken as wine.”*

**Liu Changqing’s Wife (沛郡刘长卿妻),**
of the same district as the magnate Huan Luan’s daughter, bore one son. When the son was five, her husband died, and fearing suspicion, she refused to return to her natal home. When the boy reached fifteen, his mother and stepfather, fearing for his future, preemptively mutilated his ear as an oath of their sincerity.

The matrons of the clan pitied them and said, *“If your family truly harbors no ill intent, then even if suspicions arise, you could still demonstrate your honesty through your aunts and sisters—why resort to such extreme measures as maiming?”*

She replied, *“My ancestors were the Five Dawn scholars, revered as imperial preceptors across generations without interruption. My male descendants have been honored for loyalty, my female descendants for chastity. The *Odes* say: ‘Do not forget your forebears, but cultivate their virtues.’”* The prefect of Pei, Wang Ji, reported her case to the court, which honored her as *“The Righteous Huan Zheng.”*

**Yin Yu’s Wife (南阳阴瑜妻),**
the daughter of Yingchuan’s Xun Sui, named Cai. She bore one daughter before Yu died. At the time, she was still young and comely. Later, a fellow district man, Guo Yi, lost his wife, and Xun Sui arranged for Cai to marry him. Pretending to be gravely ill, Xun Sui forced her into the marriage. Cai, clutching a dagger, swore an oath, but Xun Sui ordered servants to seize the blade and tightened the guards around her. She was thus delivered.

Guo Cai feigned joy and told her attendants, *“I had resolved to share a grave with Yin, yet I was coerced to this point. My sincerity is unshaken—what can be done?”*

She then ordered four lamps lit, adorned herself richly, and invited Yi to an audience. They spoke at length, their words unceasing. Yi, respectful and awed, dared not press further, and she left at dawn.

Cai then ordered her attendants to prepare a bath. After entering her chamber and sealing the door, she wrote in powder on the door: *“My corpse returns to the Yin clan.”* She hanged herself with her sash.

**Recorded:** These two women were both of noble lineage, their conduct a model for the age. Xun Sui, failing to trust his own daughter, brought ruin upon himself—how lamentable!

As for Cai, she never wavered from her original vow. Truly, *“If I prove untrustworthy, let the wind of bright day bear witness against me.”* Though she feigned conversation and forced smiles, it was still better than preemptively maiming oneself to prove sincerity before suspicion arose.

Let observers examine this closely.

The *Wei Shu* records: Cao Shuang’s younger brother Wen Shu’s wife, from the Qiao Commandery, was the daughter of Xiahou Wen Zhi (née **Ling Nǚ**). Wen Shu died early, and she, being young and childless, feared her family would certainly remarry her. Thus, she cut her hair as a vow of fidelity and habitually resided near Shuang.

When Shuang was executed, Ling Nǚ’s uncle petitioned the Cao family to dissolve their betrothal and force her return. At the time, Wen Zhi served as the Liang Commandery’s governor, pitying her youth and the Cao family’s extinction, hoping she would relent. He subtly sent someone to persuade her, but Ling Nǚ sighed and wept. Upon returning to her chamber, she severed her own nose with a knife, wrapped herself in her bedclothes, and lay down. When her mother called to her, she did not respond. Upon uncovering her, blood flowed across the bed and floor, shocking the entire household.

Some said to her: *“Life in this world is fleeting—like dust resting on fragile grass. Why endure such suffering?”*

Ling Nǚ replied: *“I have heard that the virtuous do not abandon their resolve even for a single morning of prosperity, nor do the righteous alter their hearts with life or death. When the Cao family was still in power, I still wished to preserve my fidelity to the end. How much more so now, when they are fallen? How could I bear to abandon them? I would never act like a beast.”*

**Recorded:** The principles of virtue and righteousness lie within the human heart. Even the sagacious and noble differ from common folk and women—yet here, their resolve is reversed in contradiction. Why?

The Dao/Way’s defilement above, the Liang Commandery’s governor willingly embraces it; the boiling broth of the sun’s brilliance, the drooling glutton sates himself upon it. But as for the springs beneath the mountains, their purity remains unchanged. Though the great stew’s flavor may fade, its essence still lingers.

The hearts of ordinary men and women can move the heavens and earth, pierce metal and stone—yet in the face of the court’s inquiries, not even the slightest resistance is shown. This is why the virtuous sigh deeply.

The record cannot cease to lament.

**Book of Jin:** The wife of Yu Zhong, Lady Sun, was a daughter of the powerful Sun family. After Yu Zhong’s death, she swore never to alter her virtue, and raised his orphaned children. When they were young, she instructed them in loyalty and righteousness. In the late years of the Yongjia era, Sun Tan served as Governor of Nankang, and when Du Qiang rebelled, he led troops to suppress him. Lady Sun exhorted her son with the resolve of certain death: *“I have heard that loyal ministers emerge from the gates of filial children. You must abandon life for virtue—do not concern yourself with my old age.”* She then emptied her household’s wealth to reward the soldiers, and offered her own jade belt and pendants as military funds. Sun Tan thus achieved victory. When Su Jun’s rebellion arose, Sun Tan defended the Huxing stronghold, holding imperial credentials to command the suppression of Su Jun. Lady Sun admonished him again: *“I have heard that loyal ministers arise from the gates of filial children. You must abandon life for virtue—do not let my age weigh upon you.”* She further dispatched all her household servants to aid in the war. At her death, aged ninety-five, the Emperor sent envoys to offer condolences and bestowed upon her the posthumous title of *Definite Virtue* (Ding). The Record says: *“A woman of such virtue—this was unheard of in antiquity.”* With Lady Sun’s unblemished conduct, the title *Definite Virtue* was truly well-deserved. It was only because her devotion to her husband was sincere that her instruction of her children was steadfast, her adherence to virtue unyielding, and thus her longevity so great. Did not Confucius say: *“Only when winter’s chill arrives do we know the pine and cypress are the last to wither?”* Could this not be referring to Lady Sun’s steadfastness?

**Book of Tang:** Empress Shun of the Taimu lineage, the Wudou clan, was from Pingling in Jingzhou. Her father, Wudou Yi, served as *Upper Pillar General* (Shangzhuguo) in the Zhou dynasty and married the Emperor’s sister, Princess Xiangyang of the Shouyang lineage. Upon entering the Sui dynasty, he became *General of Dingzhou* and *Duke of Shenwu*. When the Empress was born, her hair hung down past her neck, and by age three it was already level with her body. The Emperor cherished her and raised her in the palace. Once, another nephew remarked to the Princess: *“This girl has an extraordinary appearance and uncommon insight—how can she be rashly given to another?”*

The Emperor then ordered two peacock screens to be painted, and when suitors came seeking her hand, he instructed them to shoot two arrows—if they struck one eye of each peacock, she would be granted to them. Though many tried, none succeeded until the High Ancestor [Emperor Gaozu] arrived, who struck one eye of each peacock and thus won her.

The record states: *"The Way of perfect matching is not merely the husband choosing the wife, but also the wife choosing the husband. When their union is fated, there is always a predetermined harmony."* As the *Book of Odes* says: *"Heaven’s appointed union."*

At the turn of the Jin and Sui dynasties, even skilled artisans like Du Zhuo could easily paint peacocks—yet to strike both eyes was no trivial feat. That the Sage-Emperor [Gaozu] succeeded proves that this was Heaven’s predetermined will, not mere human contrivance.

Later, when Longsun [Empress] sought marriage, the same method revealed that the High Ancestor’s extraordinary son [Taizong] was destined for greatness. Two emperors and two empresses, matched in virtue and reverence, achieved two successive unions of perfect harmony—could this truly be mere chance? Could this truly be mere chance?

The Emperor secretly asked the Astrologer Li Chunfeng: *"Does the Secret Record truly speak of this? Is it real?"*

The Astrologer replied: *"Your servant gazes upward to examine the celestial omens and downward to scrutinize the calendrical portents. The man in question is already among Your Majesty’s officials as a kinsman. Within thirty years from now, he shall reign over all under Heaven, slaying the descendants of the Tang nearly to extinction—his destiny is already manifest."*

The Emperor said: *"If we execute all those who seem suspicious, what then?"*

The Astrologer replied: *"Heaven’s decree cannot be defied by mortal hands. Moreover, the Sovereign does not die—only the innocent perish in vain. But from this day forward, even if thirty years pass, the man will have aged, and perhaps his cruelty may lessen somewhat, his calamity abating. If we were to kill him now, Heaven might raise another in his vigor, and Your Majesty’s descendants would be utterly exterminated."*

The Emperor desisted.

It was recorded: *"If Striking General Pei had died, the world would have lacked Striking General Pei—this was a calculation of power. Now, if we were to kill him now, Heaven might raise another in his vigor—this is mere speculation. As for the sage’s resolve, what need is there for such schemes?"*

To commit one injustice, to slay one innocent, and thereby gain the world—there are things even the Sage would not do. Thus the two dynasties endured for generations, following this Way.

The Emperor’s unrighteous deeds and the slaughter of the innocent—how many were they? Heaven’s retribution was but delayed. With Your Majesty’s brilliance and decisiveness, even to uncover a single kinsman in the ranks of officials—could it truly be so easily done? If another were to rise in his vigor, would he escape the dust of obscurity?

The sage weighs not the scale of gain or loss, but the rightness of principle. In the Dongdu neighborhood of Renhe Street, the kuei-shih Pei [family] flourished with numerous descendants, a veritable noble house. During the reign of Empress Wu, the Chancellor Wei Xuan sought to marry his daughter to the Pei family before the betrothal was finalized, Wei was ensnared in the Luo Ji conspiracy, his household reduced to rags and empty tables. Upon his return from the north, the daughter had already taken the veil, and her family, despairing of sustenance, sought to send her to a convent. A nun arrived from outside and said: *"Your daughter’s fortune is vast and abundant; she shall have a noble match, and her descendants will spread across the land. She should return north."* The family dared not speak further. When the gate was opened, Pei Baozhuang came to greet her in splendid array.

Pei Baozhuang bore eight sons, all of whom excelled in the *Mingjing* examinations and held positions as officials, prefects, and governors.

When Pei Kuan served as the *Censor* of Yunzhou Prefecture, the prefect Wei Shuo had a daughter, and he sought a suitable match for her. On a day when Wei Shuo rested, he ascended a tower and saw a man in the rear garden behaving suspiciously. Upon inquiring, the attendants replied: *"It is the Censor Pei."* Shuo asked about his conduct, and the man answered: *"Pei Kuan is virtuous; he would not let a crooked deed tarnish his family."* Just then, there was a delivery of meat as tribute, which the man took and left, not daring to deceive himself, so he hid it away. Shuo marveled at his integrity and agreed to marry his daughter to him, telling his wife: *"I have always sought a fine son-in-law, and now I have found one."* The next day, he gathered his relatives to let them see him. Pei Kuan at the time wore a long, coarse green robe. When he entered, the relatives all laughed, calling him *"Green Heron Sparrow."* Shuo said: *"I love my daughter, and I believe she will become the wife of a worthy minister or high official. Why should one judge a person by appearance alone?"* He ultimately married his daughter to Pei Kuan.

Madame Liu once remarked: *"In this age of power and profit, people abandon their promises as easily as turning their palms. Yet the flourishing of the Pei clan is a manifestation of Heaven’s reward for their sincerity."*

The *Zhou* hexagram, in its formation, shows that the Sage abides long in the Dao/Way, first leading with genuine sincerity, then following with unyielding faithfulness. When the beginning and end align, its way becomes abundantly successful.

The *Cheng* hexagram, in its formation, shows that the noble one receives others with humility, attains their uprightness through mutual resonance, and matches his daughter according to her worth. When there is resonance, understanding follows, and thus its way also becomes successful.

When the Wei clan was facing misfortune, how could they have leisure to ponder the vast fortune of their daughter? Yet the bond between an elder sister and elder brother remains unchanged.

Once both firm and yielding align, and their descendants flourish, the match is found without seeking.

When the Wei family chose a husband, how could they have cared for the mockery of their relatives? Yet his steadfast sincerity and earnest virtue were truly evident.

Once harmony and resonance were established, and she became the wife of a worthy minister or high official, who could have known this by divination alone?

It is clear that ancient people acted with sincerity in every move and upheld faithfulness in every matter, and Heaven’s rewards and responses were indeed beyond doubt. How could mere worldly power and profit compare?

From the *Song History*: Zhou Wei’s wife, Mo Qian, was a virtuous woman. Zhou Wei, with the courtesy name Dechen, hailed from Gongcheng, Zhao Prefecture. Liu Yin occupied the Five Ridges, and Zhao Prefecture was his territory. The governance was oppressive and the taxes heavy, leaving the people barely able to survive. Zhou Wei led the villagers to the mountains, intending to flee to Lingling. Before reaching their destination, bandits arose along the road, cutting off supplies and forcing them back to Gongcheng, where their homes were burned to ashes. Zhou Wei then escaped northward.

In the early years of the *Jiànlóng* era, he arrived in the capital, where he was honored by Xue Ju Zheng. He submitted a memorial on ancient governance and current affairs, was summoned for examination, and granted the rank of *Jìnshì* (advanced scholar). During the second year of the *Taiping Xingguo* era, Zhou Wei served as the *Deputy Commissioner of Transportation* for the various prefectures of Guangnan.

When Zhou Wei fled north, he had no time to bid farewell to Mo Qian. Their two children were still young, and Mo Qian was still of tender age. Her parents wished to marry her off, but she wept and swore: *"Zhou Wei is not the kind to endure prolonged hardship. If he defies difficulties to travel far, he will surely rise by his own efforts."* She took up weaving early, laboring diligently at her loom to provide for their daily needs. By the time of the *Kāibǎo* era, the sheep were raised, and after the pacification of the *Zhāo* region by the Southern Han, officials sought her out and granted her money and rice for sustenance.

Nearly twenty-six years later, Zhou Wei finally returned to his homeland and reunited with Mo Qian. People marveled at their story. Their two sons had both completed their marriages.

「Zhū Yáng took the matter to heart and spread it as truth.

The record states: *"Foolishly observing Mo Qian’s story, I lament the perverse customs of the Qin and Han dynasties.* For the wife of **Su Qin** (*Su Qin*), even a single meal was hard to secure, while the wife of **Liang Yi** (*Liang Yi*) would not wait even for a night’s rest. Yet here was a woman who endured separation for **twenty-six years**, with two children still in their infancy. At the time, the **Song** dynasty’s *virtue/power* (*德*) was just emerging beyond the Five Passes, and the customs of the barbarians had greatly changed—yet still, it did not reach the point where a man of high rank, like **Wei Qi**, would have numerous attendants escorting him, and then take a woman as his consort merely for her ability to manage affairs. Alas, she may truly be called an **accomplished woman** (*贤*).

Empress **Xie** of **Emperor Lizong** (*理宗谢皇后*), her father was **Qú Bó** (*渠伯*), her grandfather **Shēn Fǔ** (*深甫*). The Empress was born with a dark complexion, and one eye was blind, having suffered from **black medicine** (*黑医*). Qú Bó died young, and the family’s fortune declined further. She once personally drew water and cooked meals to sustain them.

Initially, when **Shēn Fǔ** (*深甫*) was appointed Chancellor, he had rendered service in supporting **Yang Taizhou** (*杨太后*), and she held him in *virtue/power* (*德*). When **Lizong** (*理宗*) ascended the throne, there was discussion over selecting a **central consort** (*中宫*), and **Yang Taizhou** (*杨太后*) ordered the selection of women from the **Xie** clan. The Empress alone remained at home, and her relatives chose to decline the appointment, saying: *"If we accept the imperial decree, we must be prepared to provide lavish dowries."* By chance, on **Lantern Festival** (*元夕*), a magpie came to nest in the **Lantern Mountain** (*灯山*), and the people regarded it as an auspicious omen. Thus, they answered the summons, and the Empress soon fell ill with **erysipelas** (*病疹*), her skin peeling away until she became as **radiant and pure as jade** (*莹白如玉*). Later, the **black medicine** (*目医*) was removed through medicine.

At the time, **Jiā Xiè** (*贾涉*)’s daughter was renowned for her beauty and was also chosen. When she entered the palace, **Lizong** (*理宗*) wished to establish her as the **central consort** (*中宫*), but **Yang Taizhou** (*太后*) said: *"The Xie girl is dignified and blessed; she should be the true central consort."* The officials also whispered among themselves: *"Should we not establish the true Empress, and instead install a false one?"* The Emperor could not override this, and so the matter was settled.

The record states: *"The* **Book of Songs** (*《诗》)* says: ‘A beautiful wife stirs up strife, yet she is deeply cherished.’* The misfortune of **favoritism** (*女宠*) stems from this. The reason the **Song** dynasty’s household laws surpassed those of the **Han** and **Tang** dynasties was surely because **external kin** (*外戚*) did not interfere in governance. Yet even though **Jiā Xiè**’s daughter was chosen despite the objections of many, she was never properly installed as the **central consort** (*中官*), yet her **bed and mat affection** (*椎席之爱*)—who could truly take that away?

Thus, **Ximǎ Shìdào** (*似道*) rose from **Superintendent of the Imperial Granaries** (*司仓*), a low-ranking clerk who answered summons in the grand court, to be swiftly appointed as **Right Chancellor** (*右相*) in the military. This was because the **harm of poison** (*鸩毒之害*) festered in his heart, and the **menace of ferocious wolves** (*虎狼之威*) corrupted his governance, ultimately leading to the **ruin of the Zhao lineage** (*赵社丘墟*), the **capture of Empress Xie** (*谢后俘虏*), and the Emperor’s skull not even being spared. His name was indeed **Jiā** (*贾*), and his misfortune was real—just as the officials had whispered.

The contrast between his words in declining marriage and **Mo Qian’s** resolve is clear and convincing.»

The *Record of Words and Deeds* (*言行录*) states: When **Huáng Guīnián** (*黄龟年*) was still unmarried and his family was poor, he conducted himself with quiet dignity. Later, when he took the county examination, the examiner **Lǐ Cháoqíng** (*李朝旌*), who held the post of county magistrate, saw him and was deeply impressed, saying privately: *"How I wish this young scholar could be my son-in-law!"* Soon after, he indeed recommended Guīnián, and the magistrate, overjoyed, wished to marry his daughter to him.

When Guīnián later passed the imperial examination and returned home, the magistrate had already passed away. His widow, in mourning attire, met Guīnián on the road. He wept bitterly and sent word through a messenger, asking to fulfill their original betrothal. The widow replied:

*"How can I speak of past matters? Your former magistrate was a poor official with no private wealth. I, with nothing but my bare hands, escorted his remains west to his homeland, selling even our clothing and furnishings until they were nearly exhausted. I feared we could not reach our destination—how could I now discuss a marriage for your family? Your family’s lineage was once of the highest rank, and you should seek alliances with powerful clans. I must now depart. Please convey my refusal."*

Guīnián, tears streaming down his face, said: *"I gave my word, and if I die without keeping it, how can I face myself? A woman should not speak like a common barbarian, dismissing the words of the dead. If you allow me to fulfill my promise, I will provide for myself—do not refuse me."*

Thus, the marriage was settled. When they parted ways, they wept bitterly before going their separate paths.

The record further notes: *"Both **Liú Tíngshì** (*刘廷式*) and **Huáng Guīnián** (*黄龟年*) did not betray their original intentions after their success. Those who easily abandon friends in wealth or take wives in prosperity have already lost their virtue long before. How can one blame others?"*

The **four memorials** (*四疏*) of **Hōu Zhì** (*桧*) were not written out of self-reproach for lost virtue. Few were like him in shared ideals with **Zhān Dàfāng** (*詹大方*). His intent was clear: if one’s moral conduct is flawed and one associates with unworthy people, the consequences for the times are inevitable.

From **Chén Ràng’s** (*陈让*) *Annalsof Shàowǔ Prefecture* (*邵武府志*): The **Huáng** family, named **Shú** (*淑*), with the courtesy name **Zhìróu** (*致柔*), hailed from Sānxiā (*三溪*) in Jiànníng County (*建宁县*). As a child, she mastered the classics and histories, excelled in poetry and prose, and possessed elegant calligraphy. She married **Wáng Fáng** (*王防*), a fellow villager who had passed the imperial examinations. When Wáng died as the **Magistrate of Hù** (*泗州户曹*), Huáng personally carried his coffin home. Within a single day, her grief shattered her bones. After her mourning period ended, relatives suggested she remarry, but she declared: *"How could I show my face to Magistrate Wáng again?"* She refused, and in the end, she died from sorrow and melancholy.

「As she lay dying, she entrusted her concubine, saying: *"The poems I composed for the five households are dear to me—I cannot bear to abandon them, so let her perish with them."* The concubine then placed poison in the coffin. Her father later collected the remaining works, still numbering over a hundred, among which was one extolling bamboo:

*"Upright and steadfast, like the virtue of loyal ministers,
Lofty and solitary, like the resolve of virtuous women.
Through all four seasons, its hue remains unchanged,
Unassailable by frost and snow."*

The annalist recorded: *"From my humble perspective, reading the *Zhōu Nán* (*周南*) poem ‘Jiāo Mù’ (*乔木*), it seems to say ‘unacceptable.’ Yet the eight noble trees never lamented the chaste woman’s self-assurance, for others also held her in reverence."*

*"Could the later generations—like Cài Wénjī (*蔡文姬*), Lǐ Yì’ān (*李易安*), or the virtuous Huáng Shú (*淑*) who lost her chastity—have matched this?"*

*"This poem was composed by Huáng Shú herself. If the concubine perished with her, how could others trust her sincerity? Thus, even scholars may not always be fully trustworthy in their works. Alas!*

*"How could one not be cautious?"*

From the *Jiāhé Annals* (*嘉禾志*): **Hánxiāng** (*含香*) and **Wǎncuì** (*晚翠*) were the two concubines of **Zhāng Huángmén** (*张黄门*), the **Níng** (*宁*) family’s retainer in Míng’s **Fāngzhōu** (*芳洲*). Both were young and graceful, deeply devoted and beloved, and had been raised as virtuous daughters of good families to serve him. When their master died, the senior wife, recognizing their beauty, intended to send them away.

The two swore oaths to remain together, each cutting their hair to seal their vow, and thereafter dared not speak of it.

From then on, in lonely pavilions amid the cold winds, they spent their years in silent devotion. When their master’s fortunes waned—his coffers emptied across the four seas—his household fell into decline. They ate coarse grains and bitter herbs, unaware of age’s approach. Few in the family ever saw their faces again.

Moreover, the master’s daughter, **Héng Qīng** (*恒清*), was wed to **Yáo Líng** (*姚麟*), a military commander. She too became a widow young and kept her vow.

Thus, the virtuous say: *"As the verse goes:*
*'Laughter and speech were ever bright,
Oaths sworn day by day, unbroken light.'*
This is what they meant."

During the **Jiājìng** era, an imperial edict honored them as *"Double Virtue"* (*双节*).

The record states:
*"I observe the bonds between lord and subject, husband and wife—all united by righteousness. These two concubines remained faithful to their master because he had once been trustworthy to his lord. In life, he boasted of his martial prowess, earning the emperor’s confidence, yet drew the enmity of scheming ministers. When the prime minister conspired against him, he fell from favor, and though he lingered in quiet sorrow, he never again sought advancement. How then could these two concubines bear to serve their mistress and not live out their years?*

*Recorded thus."*

—From *Principles of the Way* (*弘道录*), Volume 53.

**Principles of the Way, Volume 54: Faithfulness in Sibling Bonds**

From *The Records of the Grand Historian* (*Shǐjì*): When King Cheng pitied his younger brother Chú Yú for playing, he carved a jade tablet from a mulberry leaf and said, *"With this, I grant you this fief."* The historian Yì selected an auspicious day, but the king replied, *"I was merely jesting with him."* Yì said, *"The Son of Heaven does not jest. When a gentleman’s words are sincere, the historian records them, rites are established, and songs are composed."* Thus, Chú Yú was enfeoffed at Yáo’s ancient domain and titled **Táng Hóu**.

The record states:
Gōu Zǐ said: *"If the king’s younger brother was meant to be enfeoffed, the Duke of Zōu should have spoken to the king in due time, not waited for the jest to be confirmed. If he was not meant to be enfeoffed, the Duke of Zōu should not have formalized the jest, granted land, and made him a ruler of the weak and small—how could this be considered sage?"*

I do not agree. The ancient sages and worthies, in their proper service to their lords and adherence to the **Dao**, would always take even the slightest good inclination—its initial appearance—and nurture it, guiding, encouraging, and fostering its virtues.

「Mencius, in his discourse on *Gǔlìán* (谷练), had his reasons, yet how much more so for a ruler still in his formative years? In the *Mèng* (蒙) hexagram, the second line of the ninth position states: *"Bāo Mèng, auspicious."* The fourth line of the sixth position says: *"Kùn Mèng, regretful."*

Indeed, for one so young and of the **Kūn** (坤, receptive) nature, his heart is like a tender sprout—soft and pliable, not yet firmly rooted. If guided with **Shùn** (顺, harmony) and **Zhèng** (正, rectitude), it will grow straight and flourish; if obstructed by **Fú** (拂, discord) and **Nì** (逆, resistance), it will wither and turn crooked. Thus, those entrusted with nurturing such a ruler must expand his capacity for tolerance, broaden his benevolent governance, and seek to harmonize and assist him. If they do not, they may well achieve the task of guiding him, yet find no path without regret. But if a single word uttered is not yet evil, yet swiftly suppressed and stifled; if an action taken is not yet contrary to **Dao**, yet immediately checked and restrained—then the ruler’s heart will only grow more stubborn, bound, and constrained. He may even be overwhelmed by his own frustrations, and our own conduct will likewise find no path without regret. This is what the **Sages** deeply warn against.

Among the ancients who excelled in fostering such rulers, none surpassed **Mèng Mǔ** (孟母). When young **Mèngzǐ** (孟子) once asked why his mother bound a pig for slaughter, she replied: *"I meant to feed it to you."* Later, she regretted her words and bought meat instead. The matter of the **Jiān Tóng** (剪桐) was of the same intent.

Though **Chéng Wáng** (成王) spoke in jest, it was to his closest kin—those who, as **Zhōu Gōng** (周公), would suddenly alter their demeanor, grow stern in their words, and insist that the younger brother should not be enfeoffed, nor should jesting be allowed. Yet **Chéng Wáng**’s single jest was not inherently wrong; it was merely the fear of our rigid constraints and the dread of our stern commands that caused his heart to veer toward other paths. Hence it was said: *"Formalize the jest, for that is how one harmonizes and guides him."* Moreover, if the ruler’s jest were utterly erased, leaving no trace, then our words would naturally sink deep into his heart. Would this not make both ruler and minister virtuous?

Yet in later ages, there were those who could not grasp the ruler’s slightest inclination and expand upon it, instead fixating solely on restraining him, thereby inviting their own regret. What then could they have in common with **Zhōu Gōng**?

In the *Zhuàn* (左传), during the twenty-second year of Duke **Lí** (僖), the people of **Sòng** (宋) formed an alliance at **Lùshàng** (鹿上), seeking the **Zhūhóu** (诸侯) status from **Chǔ** (楚). The **Chǔ** people agreed. **Gōngzǐ Mùyí** (公子目夷) said: *"For small states to vie for alliances is a calamity. Will **Sòng** not perish?"* Fortunately, the disaster was averted later that year. In autumn, the **Zhūhóu** assembled at **Mèng** (孟) to meet with the Duke of **Sòng**. **Zǐyú** (子鱼) remarked: *"The calamity lies here. The ruler desires too much, how can he endure it?"* Thus, **Chǔ** seized the Duke of **Sòng** and attacked his state. In winter, they met at **Bó** (薄) to release him. **Zǐyú** said: *"The calamity is yet to come; this is insufficient to punish the ruler."* In the twenty-first year, the Duke of **Sòng** attacked **Zhèng** (郑). **Zǐyú** declared: *"This is the calamity we spoke of."* In the eleventh month of that year, on the day of the **Xī** (己巳) new moon, the Duke of **Sòng** clashed with the **Chǔ** forces at **Hóng** (泓), and the **Sòng** army was defeated. In the spring of the twenty-third year, **Qí Hóu** (齐侯) attacked **Sòng**, besieging **Hūn** (婚). That summer, in the fifth month, **Sòng Shànggōng** (宋襄公) died, wounded from the battle at **Hóng**.

The record states: *"Though divination by **shì** (筮) and **guī** (龟) may not always be accurate, **Zǐyú** possessed wisdom. His words ring true and resolute."* Though **Bó** (伯, the leading state) relies on strength, it also adheres to **Dao**. His virtues are: **ài zhòng mù qīn** (爱众睦亲, loving the people and harmonizing with kin), **pái nán xī zhēng** (排难息争, resolving difficulties and quelling strife), **shēng shèng zhì zhì** (声盛致志, commanding presence and inspiring resolve), and **dù dé liàng lì** (度德量力, measuring **virtue** and assessing strength). **Shànggōng** (襄公), at their first assembly, humiliated two **Zhūhóu** (诸侯) rulers—this was excessive cruelty. He began with an alliance yet later waged a merciless siege—this was excessive lack of **virtue**. He, though a **Bó**, was captured and attacked—this was excessive lack of **courage**. He faced repeated defeats yet never reflected upon himself—this was excessive lack of **wisdom**. Without these four virtues, I do not know how **Shànggōng** could have sought longevity among the **Zhūhóu**.

Now there are petty market traders who, though lacking in **virtue**, act with reckless **courage**. They bully and dominate their neighbors as if no one could oppose them. One day they sue a man, the next another, and if they win, they exult in self-satisfaction; if they lose, they do not reconsider their own actions. Instead, they separate the cases and seek victory elsewhere. Yet in the end, they are bound in chains, subjected to punishments, their bodies left unmarked—still, this is not enough to deter them. Only when they face great slaughter do they cease.

The calamity of **Jū Shàng** (朱襄) was no different. Taking this as a lesson, divination by **shì** and **guī** is no longer to be trusted.

In the case of **Wèi Xuāngōng** (卫宣公), he was pressured by **Yí Jiāng** (夷姜), **Sǔzǐ** (土急子), and so he sent his son to **Qí** (齐) to be married, choosing a beautiful woman. Yet the Duke took her himself, giving birth to **Shùzǐ** (寿子), who was later known as **Xuāngōng** (宣姜). **Xuāngōng** (宣姜) then conspired with **Sǔzǐ** (土急子) against the Duke, who ordered her to be sent to **Qí**. He commanded a thief to ambush her at **Shēn** (莘) and kill her. **Shùzǐ** (寿子) informed her of this, urging her to flee, but she refused, saying: *"To abandon my father’s command—why should I live? Even if there were a land without fathers, it would still not be worth it."* When she left, she was given wine to drink, and **Shùzǐ** (寿子) carried her banner ahead. The thief killed her. When **Sǔzǐ** (土急子) arrived, he said: *"I sought her, what crime did she commit to deserve death?"* He was killed again. The people of **Wèi** (卫) lamented her fate and composed a dirge:

*"Two children ride in a boat,
   drifting, drifting in the shadows,
   wishing to speak of you, my son,
   my heart aches with sorrow.
   Two children ride in a boat,
   drifting, drifting in their passing,
   wishing to clothe you in a single armor,
   yet harm comes not from afar."*

The record states: *"In ancient times, when executing the condemned, one would always choose a virtuous reason to justify the act. Later generations, however, merely erased their names and left it at that."* The **Wèi Tàizǐ** (卫太子) of the **Hàn** (汉), **Shǐ Huángsūn** (史皇孙) of the **Táng** (唐), **Jiànchéng** (建成) and **Yuángjí** (元吉) of the **Táng**, **Guāngměi** (光美) and **Dézhāo** (德昭) of the **Sòng** (宋)—all met the same fate, yet each case invites public judgment. The people of **Wèi** (卫) still honor **Shùzǐ** (寿子), and those of **Jìn** (晋) still honor **Shēngshēng** (申生)—was this not a way of choosing death with **virtue**?

Some say: *"The virtuous man is steadfast yet not lenient. The two children’s dispute was lenient yet not steadfast."* Words must be kept, actions must be fulfilled—this is the clear principle of the petty man.

Although lacking in sincerity and resolve, one who seizes his elder brother’s food—how long could such a man remain among the virtuous sons? How long could he remain among them?

*The Dànxī* (檀兮) recounts: When **Shí Qí’s** (石祁) father, **Líng Zhòng** (龄仲), passed away, he had no legitimate sons, only six younger brothers. They consulted the oracle to determine who should inherit, and the people said: *"If one washes, dons jade, and the divination responds, then he is chosen."* Five of them washed, donned jade, and the divination responded. **Shí Qí** said: *"Who, in mourning for a parent, would wash and adorn himself with jade?"* He did not wash, did not don jade, and the divination responded. The people of **Wèi** (卫) believed the tortoise shell had knowledge.

*The Record* (录) says: Filial piety and fraternal respect are in harmony with **virtue** (德). Thus, they resonate with the divine and are confirmed by divination. As it is said: *"Official divination is first obscured; one’s intent is revealed through the tortoise shell."* These five men trusted the diviner but not themselves, schemed against others but not against the divine—why wait for the oracle’s keys and scriptures before knowing the three tortoises would not comply?

From the *Book of Han* (汉书): Empress Dowager **Gāohòu** (高后) wished to enthrone her nephews, the **Lǚ** (吕) brothers, as kings. She asked **Right Chancellor** **Líng** (陵), who replied: *"The High Ancestor swore a blood-oath with white horses, vowing not to enthrone anyone outside the **Liú** (刘) clan. If you enthrone the **Lǚ**, it violates the oath, and the realm will rise against you."* The empress was displeased. She then asked **Left Chancellor** **Píng** (平) and **Grand Marshal** **Bó** (勃), who answered: *"The High Ancestor established the realm and enfeoffed his sons. Now that the empress governs, enthroning the **Lǚ** is permissible."* The empress rejoiced. After court dismissed, **Líng** reproached **Píng** and **Bó**: *"Did you not witness the High Ancestor’s blood-oath? Now that he has passed, the empress seeks to enthrone the **Lǚ**—how can you, flattering her, face him in the underworld?"* **Píng** and **Bó** replied: *"Now, we dare speak plainly in court—you cannot. Preserving the state and securing the **Liú** lineage—you cannot either."* **Líng** had no response.

*The Record* says: What difference is there between the **Qián Tóng** (剪桐) oath and the blood-oath? **Chóu Yú** (叔虞), though a hand and foot relative, was enfeoffed by decree—thus **Zhōu Gōng** (周公) had reason to fulfill it. The **Lǚ** were private favorites; their enthronement was perverse—thus **Wáng Líng** (王陵) had reason to oppose it. This is the duty of a minister; **Wáng Líng**’s stance was correct, while **Píng** and **Bó**’s words were unworthy.

Empress **Dòu** (窦) of **Wén Dì** (文帝) had an elder brother, **Láng Jūn** (郎君), and a younger brother, **Guǎng Guó** (广国), whose courtesy name was **Shào Jūn** (少君). When he was four or five, his family was poor, and he was sold into slavery by bandits. His family lost track of him, and he passed through over ten households until reaching **Yìyáng** (宜阳), where he worked in the mountains cutting charcoal. One evening, as he slept by the riverbank, a landslide buried over a hundred people—yet **Shào Jūn** escaped unharmed. He returned to **Cháng’ān** (长安), where fortune-tellers said he would soon become a marquis. At the time, the empress had just been enthroned, and her family lived in **Guānjīn** (观津), bearing the surname **Dòu**. Though **Guǎng Guó** was young, he remembered the county name and surname, and recalled his sister had once fallen while picking mulberries with him—details he used as verification. He wrote to the empress, who told the emperor, who summoned him. **Guǎng Guó** recounted his story, and it was confirmed. The emperor further questioned him: *"When your sister left you, she gave you a message at the inn, bathed you after ten days, and fed you before departing."* The empress wept, bestowed great riches upon him, and enfeoffed his brother as **Jiàng Hóu** (绛侯).

**Guàn Jiāng Jūn** (灌将军) and others said: *"We owe our lives to fate, yet we would hang these two men."* These two men’s origins were humble, and their rise was extraordinary—worthy of guidance and transmission. Moreover, they were involved in the **Cháng** (昌) family’s great affairs. Thus, they were placed under the care of virtuous elders of upright conduct, and from then on, they became modest and unassuming, never abusing their wealth and power.

*The Record* says: I observe that **Han**’s great scholars were unclear in their teachings. They gathered the emperor’s eldest and younger sons but did not educate them—yet they singled out these two men for instruction. Truly, they did not understand their kind. As for **Jiàng** and **Guàn**, what did they not scheme for themselves? At first, they feared retribution; in the end, they dreaded losing their lives. Given their humble origins—rare in history—how much more cautious would they be if they held power for generations? The decline of the **Mǎng** (莽) dynasty did not begin overnight.

From the *History of Sòng* (宋史): When **Wáng Ānshí** (王安石) held power, **Wáng Ānlǐ** (王安礼) submitted a memorial: *"When human affairs falter below, omens appear above. Your Majesty has a heart for benevolence and compassion, yet your blessings do not reach the people. The cause lies with the great ministers around you—unjust and crooked, they slander the loyal as disloyal, elevate the unworthy as virtuous. Those who wield power exploit it for private gain, their efforts as futile as digging in ditches or gathering in gardens. Their actions disrupt the harmony of **yin** and **yang**, summoning celestial anomalies. If you investigate the conduct of those close to you, block the gates of deceit, and perform rites of supplication—even a few sincere words would suffice to avert heavenly retribution."*

Shénzōng, upon reading the memorial, praised and sighed, replying: *"Wáng Guī wishes you to elaborate fully, but I say you should not obstruct or resist the words of others, lest you blind yourself. Now, if one covers his eyes with a single finger, even Mount Tàihé before him would remain unseen—how different is this from those close confidants who blind their sovereign? This is where you must place greater trust in yourself."*

Shénzōng further addressed the chief ministers: *"Fù Bì has submitted a memorial."* Zhāng Dùn asked, *"What does Bì speak of?"* The Emperor replied, *"He says those around me are filled with petty men."* Dùn said, *"Let him be examined—who among them are petty?"* The Emperor said, *"Bì is a veteran minister of three reigns—how can I order him examined?"* Left Chancellor Wáng Ānlǐ said, *"Bì’s words are correct."* After court adjourned, Dùn rebuked Ānlǐ: *"Your words to the throne were mistaken."* Ānlǐ replied, *"If today we speak sincerely as you describe, and tomorrow claim the Emperor’s wisdom surpasses our own, how can we not be called [□ □ □ □] in response?"*

Lù recorded: *"From ancient times, treacherous ministers might deceive their sovereign, yet could not deceive their own households; they might deceive the realm, yet could not deceive those of shared breath. If one brother says, ‘Celestial omens are not to be feared, nor are the words of men,’ while another says, ‘When human affairs falter below, omens appear above,’ and if their sovereign declares, ‘A single finger covering the eye obscures even Mount Tàihé,’ and their chief ministers add, ‘Those close about the throne are many petty men, blocking their sovereign’s path’—is this not perfectly clear? Yet still they cannot be moved. This seems contrary to reason—does Heaven truly steal their natural judgment, as when a great cart lacks its draft poles and a small one lacks its axle?"*

The Way is not thus—waiting upon one’s elder brother as an aide, yet failing to fulfill his trust, while the younger brother rebels against the elder and yet claims the elder should trust him even more. Even if he were misled, how could he fall so utterly?

In the Song dynasty’s Yuanfong eighth year (1085), the elder brother, Cheng Hao (伯淳), of the Henan Cheng clan, passed away. His younger brother, Cheng Yi (文颜), inscribed his tomb: *"Mingdao Master."* In response, Cheng Yi composed:

*"When Zhou Gong died, the Way of the Sage did not prevail.
When Mencius died, the Sage’s learning was not passed on.
The Way not prevailing, a hundred generations lacked good governance.
The learning not transmitted, a thousand years lacked true Confucians.
Good governance not achieved, yet scholars still could discern its essence.
But when true Confucians vanish, men drift without direction—human desires prevail, and Heaven’s principle is extinguished.*

*Our Master was born fourteen hundred years later, retrieving the untransmitted learning from the ancient texts and taking upon himself the task of reviving this tradition. He refuted heterodoxies, rejected false teachings, and made the Sage’s Way resplendent once more in the world. Since Mencius, he stands alone.*

*Yet scholars, lost in their pursuit of the Way, do not recognize his achievement. They do not grasp its depth, nor do they understand the fittingness of his name.*

*Recorded is his conduct: his upright bearing, measured steps, and composed speech—none questioned his parents or siblings on these matters. Mingdao’s teachings were the unbroken transmission of sages and the lineage of teachers and friends, not mere speculation from private reflection.*

*Yet while You Gong could inscribe his epitaph, he could not compose his eulogy. Why?*

*The two brothers, in their time, were equals in virtue and achievement—like jade and precious stones, their worth was unmatched. Yet the connoisseur distinguished their grades, and the world may doubt this judgment.*

*Compare this to the case of An Li suing An Shi—how could they be likened?*

*Wang Cheng (王庠), the younger brother, recorded their family’s ancestral residence as the *Yimen* (義門, "Hall of Righteousness"). His father, Wang Mengyi (王梦易), once served as acting governor of Xingzhou and later oversaw tea distribution in Sichuan, establishing tea shops and conscripting labor. The regional governor resented his authority and, under false charges, demoted him by three ranks before he died in disgrace. His mother, Lady Xiang (向氏), was the aunt of Empress Chen Shengxian (钦肃皇后). She mourned with such fervor that her grief was extreme.*

*Cheng told his brother: ‘Our father was driven out for his integrity. Mother, holding his coffin, swore we must succeed in restoring his rank before she would allow burial. We must strive together.’ Thus, they shut themselves away, immersing themselves in classics and history, seeking teachers far and wide, and probing the essence of the Way.*

*In his youth, Cheng wrote to the chancellor, advocating balanced, impartial governance. Both Tao Qiu (陶渊明) and Su Xie (苏辙) held him in high regard. He also sent a letter to Su Shi (苏轼) on the *Classics*, stating:*

*"In the ages of the Two Sovereigns and Three Kings, scholars aspired to moral cultivation. Because self-realization was so difficult, their resolve was unshakable. Since Confucius and Mencius established the Six Classics, the Way became fixed in doctrine, and scholars’ cultivation lagged behind the ancients. Thus, later ages, seeing the Classics as easy, neglected them and failed to practice them."*

*Su Shi replied: ‘Truly, your words are profound.’*

*During the Yuanyou era (1086–1094), Lü Tao (吕陶) recommended him for the *Yingzhi* (应制) examination. He then critiqued the times’ failures, declaring: ‘Obstruction within and without will breed military threats.’ His younger brother returned home in defeat.*

*In the Daoguang era (1107–1110), when the *xingshe* (行舍) system was implemented, he was again summoned by imperial decree. He declined, saying: ‘Earlier, I sought office to care for my aging mother; now that she is old and I answer the decree, is this truly my original intent?’ Instead, his brother was elevated to court, his father’s rank was posthumously restored, and only then was burial permitted. After his mother’s death and the completion of mourning, he was again recommended for the *Baxing* (八行) examination. The Grand Secretary deemed him first in the land, and an edict honored his family.*

*The empress dowager once wished to appoint him, but he consistently deferred to his brother. After Cheng’s death, Emperor Xiaozong (孝宗) posthumously conferred the title *Xianjie* (贤节, "Virtuous and Righteous").*

*Recorded is this: ‘How difficult it is to maintain integrity in later years! Cheng, with his sincerity and love of learning, did not seek advancement lightly. He delighted in honoring his kin and trusted friends, never scheming for wealth or status. Some may criticize his later years for seeming to wane in resolve, but scholars must take heed.*

*Others say: Cheng was a noble kinsman of great influence. Initially, he refined himself, associating with eminent scholars and seeking to uphold his family’s prestige. Yet in the end, his fortunes fluctuated, and he achieved nothing of lasting worth, fulfilling only his own ambitions. His lavish estate and imperial honors were perhaps unavoidable, but one cannot demand of him the grandeur of Yu Yuan’s conduct or Zhongche’s integrity. Observers must understand this.*

*As for Emperor Lizong (理宗), his childhood name was Yuju (与莒), and his younger brother was Yujie (与苒). During the *Qianlong* era (潜龙), soothsayers had foretold that the two would rise to great nobility, though few believed it. At the time, Shi Miyi (史弥远) had long held the chancellor’s office, and Prince Zhan (皇子站) despised him. The chancellor, pondering a successor, saw an opportunity when Prince Yi of Yi (沂靖王) had no heir and could be manipulated as a pretext. Among the chancellor’s guests was Yu Tianshi (余天锡), a man of scrupulous integrity who avoided external affairs. Shi Miyi held him in high regard.*

*When Yu Tianshi prepared to return home for the provincial examinations, Shi said: ‘Prince Yi has no heir. If there are worthy and virtuous princes among your kin, I would be honored if you could bring them forward.’ Yu Tianshi crossed the Yangtze to the western gate of Yue (越), where a torrential rain forced him to take shelter. A village elder named Quanbao (全保) invited him in, offering him a meal. The elder was distinguished by his dignified beard, and soon introduced his two grandsons to stand before him. Yu Tianshi was struck by their bearing and asked about them. Quanbao said, ‘These are my grandsons.’ Yu Tianshi recalled the chancellor’s request and, deeming their lineage fitting, reported them. Shi Miyi summoned the boys, examined them, and was greatly impressed. Fearing leaks, he hastily sent them back.*

*Quanbao was overjoyed. The following year, Shi Miyi suddenly asked Yu Tianshi: ‘Could the two boys return?’ Quanbao declined, but Shi secretly instructed him: ‘The elder will rise highest—he should be nurtured at home.’*

「Not long after, he was summoned to succeed the Prince of Yi (嗣沂王), and thus ascended to the imperial throne—this was Emperor Lizong (理宗). 录 said: ‘In my humble view, Yu Tianshi (余天锡) and Zheng Qing (郑清) both attained high office through their scholarly pursuits, while Zhao Yujin (赵与莒) and Zhao Yurang (赵与苒) rose from common citizens to the lofty heights of imperial favor. At this time, the weight of the eight prerogatives and the dignity of the nine ranks lay in the breath and grasp of those who could sway advancement and decline, yet the court did not hear of it, nor did the Empress Mother know. The empire of Song now rested merely on an empty name.’

In such circumstances, how could loyalty not run deep, trust not be absolute, favor not be supreme, and yet the tutors and ministers dare not again impose their will, nor the designated heir rely on their support? The *Book of Changes* (《易》) speaks of ‘what is not sealed will not be completed,’ and the *Book of Odes* (《诗》) warns of ‘ears listening at the wall’—these are words about power.

The *Comprehensive Records* (《通志》) states: Li Chengfang (李承芳) of Mingjia (明嘉鱼), styled Moqing (茂卿) and surnamed Dongjiao (东娇), with his younger brother Li Chengji (李承箕), styled Shiqing (世卿) and surnamed Dayaya (大崖), both cultivated themselves with austere resolve, cherished antiquity, and strove to embody its virtues. They harbored lofty ideals, their *qi* (气) unyielding to the world’s inclinations. Their studies did not dwell on pedantic commentary but sought to penetrate directly the essence left by Confucius and Mencius. When young, their father pointed to a local scholar, Kong the Censor (孔御史), who loved reciting the classics, clad in purple robes and girdled with gold, and asked, ‘Do you believe this? Can you follow his example?’ They replied, ‘We do not indulge in wealth nor lament poverty—our brother admires this path alone.’

When they grew older and became *xiangsheng* (庠生, students of the village school), they despised the pursuit of official examinations. The local authorities pressed them, and when they took the test, they both passed by chance. Upon reading the annotations of earlier scholars, they deemed them as fragmenting the sacred texts, saying, ‘The *Shijing* (《诗》) and *Shujing* (《书》) are the nearest foundations of our Dao (道).’ Since ancient times, the greatest harm to the hearts of the people has been none more than that caused by the *xueguan* (学官, officials of learning); the greatest harm to the cultivation of scholars has been none more than that wrought by the examination system; the most shameless in leading the masses without restraint has been none more than today’s teachers and generals. They resolved to abolish all such practices entirely.

Seeking true teachers and venerable scholars, they treated them as the virtuous men of their village—then they would teach one village; as the virtuous men of their country—then they would teach one country; only then would they be considered worthy. When they paid respects to the Grand Magistrate of the Supreme Court (大理评事), they sighed and said, ‘This office cannot save lives nor discern the shifts of the times; my body cannot bend to the world’s demands nor rise to its heights. I am unworthy of this post.’ Thus, they declined due to illness and returned home.

Shiqing (世卿) once attended the provincial examination, but upon returning, he did not hesitate to travel a thousand miles to study under Chen Baisha (陈白沙). With him, they ascended heights and lamented antiquity, composed poetry and inscribed calligraphy, yet none surpassed his method of true learning. After some time, he exclaimed in joy, ‘I have attained it!’ For learning is not merely transmitted through words—this is not true transmission. There are those whose eyes are bound, yet whose Dao remains intact. Thus, he returned home, abandoning all ambitions for advancement, and daily sat alone in a chamber, purifying his body and mind, without climbing the ranks but directly seeking the fundamental truth. In matters of seniority, they treated each other as teacher and friend.

Later, he inscribed Chen Baisha’s tombstone with the words: ‘The void establishes the foundation; movement attains the divine. Doubt is contained within it, as heaven soars and the depths plunge.’ The gentlemen took this as his own insight.

录 said: ‘Wang Wenku (王文恪) remarked: There is one who feels indignation at the common practices of the world and expresses it through his singular vision. What the world approves, I alone reject; what the world condemns, I alone do not reject. What I reject and do not reject is what my heart finds at ease. What does my heart find at ease? It is *li* (理, principle), it is *yi* (义, righteousness). Are not such as these two gentlemen the ones who stand firmly in their convictions and are unmoved by external influences?’

**The Trust of Friends**

From *The Great Chronicle of the Sovereigns*: Shun at the age of twenty, his filial piety and loyalty to friends renowned among people, had seven friends: Xiong Tao (雄陶), Fang Hui (方回), Xu Ya (续牙), Bo Yang (伯阳), Dong Bu Zui (东不訾), Qin Bu Xu (秦不虚), and Ling Fu (灵甫). At that time, he did not speak for the sake of speaking, nor did his words lack purpose; he wielded the *Black Virtue* (玄德) with resolve, transforming it in his heart, swift as divine command. Without trust, even if one’s words were eloquent and heard by all, one could not transform even a single person.

*Record of the Great Dao* said: These seven cannot be verified.

If one speaks of *li* (理, principle) and *yi* (义, righteousness), which the common people do not see, there is still much more they do not know. *Recorded.*

*The Transmission of the Great Learning* states: "In dealing with the people of one’s state, one must stop at trust."

*Record of the Great Dao* said: What people did King Wen deal with? He had Bo Yi and Tai Gong as his exemplary teachers, and Da Dian (大颠), Hun Yao (闳夭), San Yi (散宜), Sheng (生), Nan Guan (南官), and Bao as his loyal attendants and ministers. If the roots of *shu* (芍, *Pueraria lobata*) were not firmly established, then every word and deed would be nothing but flattery and deceit. The affairs of *gu* (苟, temporizing), *ze* (责, blame), *li* (戾, calamity), and *wang* (罔, confusion)—if one served the Shang (殷) dynasty with such motives, it would be mere hollow words. Thus, it does not say "friends" but "the people of one’s state," for in dividing the realm into three, he held two-thirds of the mandate. *The Analects* state: The Master said, "Take trust as the foundation among friends."

*Record of the Great Dao* said: Trust in the Five Constants (五常) is like the earth among the Five Phases (五行), the foundation upon which one stands firm and completes the beginning and end. If one does not uphold this, then one’s nature and alignment with the *Dao* (天道) are merely words passed from mouth to ear. The practice of the *junzi* (君子) has not yet reached the level of true cultivation, yet one dismisses me as an eccentric, as hidden, as knowing, or as overly learned. Then comes the confusion.

Only trust is such that one’s words are as boundless as heaven, and one’s actions are as steadfast as earth. Neither exhaustion nor the four teachings (四教) can diminish it. It is difficult to display in speech, yet difficult to conceal in silence—only when it is resolute and true can it stand. Later, those who take trust as their foundation for all ages, their reverence for virtue and repayment of merit, are none other than these. Thus, is this not the very intention of the Sage?

Further, it discusses the duties of a disciple: "Be cautious and trustworthy; extend universal love and hold close to the virtuous." It discusses the learning of the *junzi*: "Take loyalty and trust as the foundation; do not befriend those who are not like yourself."

*Record of the Great Dao* said: The duties of a disciple are not yet the concern of those who seek learning. The *junzi*’s learning, however, is the business of the *daren* (大人). Yet one says "cautious and trustworthy" while the other says "take loyalty and trust as the foundation"—why is there no distinction? Learning is to align with the times and cultivate habits; delight is to harmonize with friends. These are all matters of human nature, from the novice to the Sage, one and the same. It is only that people fail to observe this: some, when speaking of the novice, regard caution and trust as essential, but when discussing the affairs of the *daren*, treat trust as a minor matter and friendship as frivolous. They do not know that the essential path to governing the state and pacifying the world is to be found in loyalty and trust, and lost through arrogance and complacency.

Thus, the *junzi* cannot neglect loyalty and trust, for they are the foundation.

Zengzi said: "Can one be trusted in dealings with friends?"
Zixia said: "In dealings with friends, one’s words must be trustworthy."
Youzi said: "Trust is close to righteousness; words can be reconsidered."

*Record of the Great Dao* said: From ancient times, trust has been spoken of as the root of all things. Why focus solely on friends?

Father and son are bound by nature, brothers by affection, ruler and subject by righteous duty, husband and wife by form. Each has a clear, unalterable division, and one’s heart and resolve cannot diverge from it, nor can one’s words and deeds ignore it. But friends—those from east, west, south, or north—once gathered, share no kinship of bone and flesh, nor fixed mandate of heaven. Their depths are uncertain, their intentions unclear. Without trust to sustain them, there is no way to ensure their loyalty like that of a ruler and subject, or their steadfastness like that of a husband and wife, or their unbreakable bond like that of father and son or brothers.

If one does not care for their sincerity, what does one know of their clasped hands?
If one does not heed their words, what does one know of their shoulder-taps?
This is not unlike the lament of *Gu Feng* (谷风) or the mockery of the *Gui* (鬼) of the netherworld.

Yet the most essential and most essential thing is to establish trust and harmonize with what is fitting. If one does not harmonize with what is fitting, then there are those called "dying companions," those called "mercenary friendships," and those like the conduct of Tai Sheng (尾生) and Bai Gong (白公). Among the Sage’s disciples, Param (参) upheld the agreements, Shang (商) was deeply trustworthy, Ruo (若) diligently rooted himself in principle. Thus, trust in the *Dao* was firmly established.

The joy of having friends is such as this—how can the scholar afford to neglect it? The Master sent Qi Diao (漆雕开) to serve, and he replied: "I have not yet attained trust." The Master was pleased. *Record of the Great Dao* said: The Master said, "Ancient scholars cultivated for themselves; modern scholars cultivate for others." Those who cultivate for themselves seek attainment within themselves: "I have not yet attained trust." Those who cultivate for others seek recognition from others: there are the common people, there are the ancestral altars and the state granaries—why must one read books before calling oneself a scholar?

Ah! Knowing the thief who harms the lamb, one understands the Master’s words.

He told Fan Xu (樊须): "If the ruler values trust, then the people will not dare to betray their sincerity. If this is so, then the people from all four directions will bring their children to settle here—why would one need to marry?"

*Record of the Great Dao* said: Others have intentions; I measure them. The Sage has never abandoned sincerity. The one without sincerity cannot find the right words, nor has he ever indulged in mere sentiment. Yet this is beyond what Fan Xu could comprehend.

Though the virtuous recognize the greater truth, and the less virtuous recognize the lesser, Yi Yin (伊尹) plowed as a farmer, and the Duke of Zhou (周公) managed agriculture—these were their outward appearances. But in their hearts, they delighted in the *Dao* of Yao and Shun, and in the affairs of the Three Sovereigns (三王).

Thus, even common folk and common women may not be blessed by the virtue of Yao and Shun. If one were to cast them into the ditch, would they not still act with sincerity? The heavens have not sent violent winds or torrential rains, nor has the sea raised its waves—this has lasted three years now. Perhaps there is a Sage in the Central States, who has never failed to value trust.

This is why our scholars are matched with Heaven and share with Earth, not sharing the same fate as the mere four classes of commoners—precisely because of this. If we take this as a lesson, there are still followers of Chen Liang, like Chen Xiang, who abandon their learning to study Xu Xing instead.

From the *Spring and Autumn Annals*: When Ji Zha passed through Xu, the ruler of Xu admired his sword but dared not speak of it. Ji Zha knew this in his heart and did not yet present it as a tribute to the superior states. Upon returning to Xu, the ruler of Xu had already died, so Ji Zha unsheathed his sword and struck the tree of the Xu ruler’s house before departing. His attendants said, *"The ruler of Xu is already dead—who remains to receive this?"* The *Rites* say, *"No. My heart had already promised it—how could I, upon his death, betray my sincerity?"*

The *Record* says: The ruler of Xu’s desire for the sword was not yet revealed, yet Ji Zha knew it by heart. The intention of Shou Meng in establishing Ji Zha was also not yet revealed, yet Ji Zha knew it by heart. It was not about the sword itself, but about confirming his own trustworthiness. Thus, if one’s heart cannot be betrayed, then the refusal of a state becomes clearly justified.

Han Xuanzhi had a jade pendant, one of which was with Zheng Shang, who had already sold it. The merchant said, *"You must inform your lord."* Han Xuanzhi asked Zi Chan: *"I will request the pendant from you. If the officials do not approve, I dare not take it again. Now I am buying it from the merchant, who says I must report it—dare I ask your permission?"*

Zi Chan replied: *"Our former lord, Duke Huan, and the merchants all originated from Zhou. When they were common laborers, they swore an oath with a bundle of *Ai* grass, cutting reeds and wild plants, and lived together. There was a covenant: 'Do not betray me, and I will not force you into unfair trade. If either party seizes profit or treasures, the other shall not be informed.' Relying on this oath, they have protected each other until today. Now you come with favor and shame us, yet claim our city forcibly takes the merchant’s goods—this contradicts our ancient oath. Would it not be better to refrain? You gain the jade but lose the alliance of the feudal lords—this you would not do."* He dared to announce this publicly.

Han Xuanzhi declined the jade and secretly visited Zi Chan to pay his respects and offer the gift. The *Record* says: This was about maintaining trust in dealings with the people. It shows that even in the smallest matters, the ancients would not betray trust or break promises. Yet later generations sometimes considered such matters harmless—only to see harm follow swiftly. Thus, gaining the jade while losing the alliance of the feudal lords was already a reality in the *Spring and Autumn* era. Who, then, could truly emulate Han Xuanzhi’s willingness to correct his mistakes?

The people of Zheng gathered in the village schools to discuss the officials. Ran Ming openly said to Zi Chan: *"How can we destroy the village schools?"* Zi Chan asked, *"Why?"* He said: *"People retire in the morning and evening to discuss the officials’ good deeds—I will implement them. What they dislike, I will change. This is my teacher. If so, why destroy them? I have heard that loyalty and goodness reduce resentment, not that tyranny prevents it. If I were to suppress it abruptly, the damage would be like a great flood breaking its banks—many would be harmed, and I could not save them. It is better to make a small mistake and correct it through guidance."* Ran Ming said: *"Alas, only now do I know that your sincerity is worthy of serving."* Though I am unworthy, if I truly carried this out, Zheng would indeed rely on me.

The *Record* says: Han Yu once composed an ode: *"When Zhou rose, the elders sought counsel; when it declined, slanderers were appointed as censors. Only Zi Chan, the model of governance, was not met with his due. His influence transformed but one state."* Perhaps this was lamenting the past. He also said: *"If one sincerely follows this Way, governing the world’s lords, their virtue spreads far and wide, benefiting all under Heaven. Alas, the four seas are ungoverned—there are rulers but no ministers."* Perhaps this was lamenting the future.

Yet, considering how the gentleman conducts himself: In times of order, speaking and acting boldly—like the people of Zheng gathering in the village schools. In times of disorder, acting cautiously and speaking modestly—like the Duke of Zhou’s virtue in the case of the Wei pervert. Thus, discussing officials in times of peace is acceptable, but censoring slander in times of chaos is not. To consider only whether it is condemned, without reflecting on whether it is right or wrong, is mere empty talk. This is something one must truly understand.

The Sea Crow spoke: *"It dwells outside the eastern gate of Lu."* Two days later, Zang Wen Zhong had the people of the state sacrifice to it. Zhan Qin remarked: *"How excessive! Zang Sun’s governance!"*

Sacrifice is the great ritual of the state. The sage-kings established sacrifices according to this principle: if one’s actions benefit the people, they are enshrined; if one dies in service, they are enshrined; if one labors to stabilize the state, they are enshrined; if one wards off great calamities, they are enshrined; if one alleviates great sufferings, they are enshrined. Those who do not meet these criteria are not included in the sacrificial rites.

The five categories—*jiao* (sacrifices to the land), *zong* (ancestral rites), *zu* (sacrifices to the state’s founders), *fu* (sacrifices to the five great sacrifices), and *bao* (sacrifices to the five great offerings)—are the state’s established rites. Added to these are the altars of the soil and grain, the mountains and rivers, all of which have rendered great merit to the people. The three celestial luminaries, which the people revere; the five phases of earth, which bring forth life; the nine regions, great mountains, and rivers, which provide wealth and resources—these are the foundations of the state’s prosperity.

Now, the Sea Crow has arrived, yet it is unknown and uninquired after, and yet it is being sacrificed to without merit, as if it were an established ritual. This is difficult to call both virtuous and wise. Will this year bring disaster to the sea?

The birds and beasts of the broad waters instinctively know and avoid calamity. This year, the sea has seen great winds and winter frosts. Zang Wen Zhong, hearing the words of Liu Xia Ji, said: *"Indeed, I have erred."* The words of the Master of Liu Xia are not to be disregarded. He ordered them recorded as the *San Jia* (Three Admonitions). The record states: *"Liu Xia Hui was harmonious in nature—why were his words so decisive, not mere empty conformity?"*

The Sea Crow’s ignorance is a minor fault; not inquiring after it is a grave one. A high official, the people’s model and guide, whose actions determine their obedience or defiance—if he persists in error and never acknowledges his faults, this has indeed happened before.

Yet there were ancient officials who were open-hearted, joyful in goodness, balanced in spirit and calm in *qi*—none of them held rigid personal opinions. Some might call this lack of obstinacy unvirtuous. But to know yet feign ignorance, to accept frank criticism, and to acknowledge and correct one’s faults—this is true wisdom, this is true sincerity.

Cheng Ying and Gong Sun Chujiu were guests of Zhao Shuo. During the disaster at Xia Gong’s palace, Chujiu said to Cheng Ying: *"Why do you not die?"* Ying replied: *"Zhao Shuo’s wife is with child. If a son is born, I will raise him. If it is a daughter, I will die soon enough."* Soon after, a son was born, and Tu An Jia learned of it and demanded the child. Zhao Shuo’s wife hid the boy in a basket and prayed: *"If the Zhao lineage perishes, may this jade shatter. If it does not, may it remain silent."* When Tu An Jia searched for the child, the jade made no sound. After escaping, Ying told Chujiu: *"Now one search has failed, but they will return. What shall we do?"* Chujiu said: *"Choosing between saving the orphan or dying—which is harder?"* Ying replied: *"Saving the orphan is harder."* Chujiu said: *"The Zhao ancestors treated you generously. You take on the harder task, so I will take the easier."* The two plotted to take another infant, wrap it in fine cloth, and hide it in the mountains, then send word to summon the troops. Chujiu said: *"What a petty man Cheng Ying is! Unable to die, he conspires to hide the orphan—and now he sells him too."* He embraced the child and cried out, begging for its life, but was refused. They killed Chujiu as well, and the generals rejoiced.

Yet the true orphan lived on, hidden with Ying. Fifteen years later, Duke Jing fell ill. When divination was performed, it was said: *"The descendants of the two great houses will not perish."* Chong Gong asked Han Yue, who knew the Zhao orphan still lived. He said: *"The descendants of the two great houses have been cut off—perhaps it is the Zhao lineage."* He then revealed the truth. Duke Jing summoned the orphan.

When the generals entered to inquire after the duke’s health, Jing used Han Yue’s forces to coerce them into seeing the Zhao orphan. Yue said: *"The disaster was caused by Tu An Jia. Had it not been for your illness, the ministers would have already petitioned to restore the Zhao heir. Now that you have given the order, the ministers are in agreement."* Thus, Zhao Wu was summoned, and the generals knelt in submission. They attacked Tu An Jia, exterminated his clan, and restored the Zhao lands.

Ying then took leave of Zhao Wu, saying: *"Long ago, I did not die so that the Zhao lineage might endure. Now that you are established, I will descend to report to Zhao Meng and Gong Sun Chujiu."* Wu wept and begged: *"I beg you, strain your body to the utmost, and serve until death. How can you abandon me?"* Ying said: *"It cannot be. They believed they could accomplish the task, so they died before me. If I do not descend to report, it will be as if my mission failed."* He then killed himself.

The record states: *"In my view, the loyalty of Cheng Ying and Chujiu does not fall short of Li Ke and Gu Si’s service to their lord. Loyalty is not merely about being unashamed of difficult words but also about consistently fulfilling one’s promises.

Before Shen Sheng’s death, Gu Si was honored as a high minister, and Li Ke served as the prime tutor—unlike the two men, who were merely guests. Had these two ministers exerted themselves wholeheartedly, united in purpose, and taken on the difficult tasks while dividing the easier ones, personally escorting the prince into exile as Ying preserved the orphan, it could have been done. That Shen Sheng did not escape and Li Ke did not perish with him—this was Li Ke’s greatest failing. To personally await execution in court, as Chujiu falsely accused himself, could also have been done. But failing that, to rely on figures like Ji Qi and Zhi Zi to devise shifting strategies—this was precisely what Ying called the ‘harder’ path. The danger lay in a single search; if they had not been forced to kill again, it would have been clear.

Alas! A mere orphan, yet a noble lord. If one believes the difficult is impossible, the living may die; if one believes the easy is certain, the living may perish. This is evident in the four men.

As for the idea of descending to report—generally, the scholars of the *Spring and Autumn* would not delve deeply into such matters. When Jin held Duke Xiang captive, Duke Li of Wu saw Xiang and said: *"I will plead your case."*

Chu Xiang made no reply and left without bowing. The others all blamed Chu Xiang, but he said, *"It must be Qi Dai."*

The senior retainers heard this and said, *"Le Wang’s words to the lord were unrestrained—nothing was left undone. He sought pardon for your son, but your son refused Qi Dai. This was beyond the power of the ministers. Yet he insists it must be so—why?"*

Chu Xiang replied, *"Le Wang is a follower of the lord—how could he act alone? Qi Dai, when recommending others, never discarded even the lowliest; when promoting from within, he never overlooked his kin. Yet he alone abandoned me."*

Now Qi Dai was old. Hearing this, he hurried by courier to see Prince Yuan and said:

*"The *Odes* say: ‘Grant me no harshness, that my descendants may preserve it.’ The *Book of Documents* says: ‘The sage’s counsel is steadfast, his virtue unwearied—thus he secures and preserves.’ He who plans with few errors and teaches with unflagging kindness—Chu Xiang is such a man, the bulwark of the state. Even if his descendants were to be spared for ten generations, it would be to encourage the worthy. But now, he is not even spared himself, and the state is abandoned—is this not bewildering?

Gun was prolonged, and Yu arose. Guan and Cai were executed, yet the Duke of Zhou upheld the king. How could one, with the ferocity of a tiger, abandon the state?"*

Prince Yuan was pleased, took Qi Dai with him, and spoke to the ministers, securing his pardon. Chu Xiang was not informed, and when he was freed, he attended court as usual.

The record says: *"I observe Chu Xiang’s affair and sigh at the difficulty of ascending like Mount Song and the ease of collapsing like a cliff. The one who would spare ten generations is the path to encouraging the worthy; ‘my descendants shall preserve it’ is the matter of perpetuating the lineage. Yet with the Ji She clan, one Chu Xiang’s virtue was insufficient to sustain it, while one Chu Hu’s ruin was more than enough. This is something to fear, yet not to rely upon.

Though Qi Dai’s words temporarily spared one man’s humiliation, yet Bo Shi further damaged his lineage—where is the ten-generation pardon now? Thus, the virtuous man is ever vigilant. Even if he has merit, he cannot rely upon it, let alone the degenerate descendants of licentious and greedy ancestors.

Now, observing the origins of these two men’s misfortunes, they all stemmed from the words of their junior officials. Though the historian may not trace their full consequences, if one seeks to benefit his lineage, he must heed the warnings of Yin’s downfall.

Chu Xiang traveled to Zheng. He Ming’s son, Hei Mei, wished to see him and, following the baggage carriers, stood beneath the hall’s eaves. With a single word, he corrected him.

Chu Xiang heard this and said, *"It must be He Ming’s son."*

He took his hand and raised him, saying: *"In days past, Jia Dai had a wife of great beauty. For three years, he neither spoke nor smiled. When he drove to Ru Gao and shot a pheasant, his wife first laughed and spoke. Jia Dai said: ‘Talent cannot be suppressed—if I could not shoot, you would not have spoken or laughed.’ Now, though you are young and unrenowned, if you had remained silent, I would have nearly lost you. The necessity of speech is such."*

They parted as old acquaintances.

The record says: *"I ponder the ancients’ love of virtue—truly, it was as if they could not help themselves—and sigh at how modern men abandon themselves and neglect their duties. Mencius said: ‘If Xi Zi were covered in filth, all would hold their noses and pass by. Yet even with evil men, if they fast, bathe, and purify themselves, they may serve the Lord on High.’ Though appearance may not suffice for attendance, how much more so for virtue!

To seek Chu Xiang—why? For his vast learning? For his virtue? Yet in the end, he was praised for his virtuous observation alone, known and valued for his discernment. Imagine, in the moment he descended the hall, when their hands met—what joy was there!

The *Odes of Zhou* say: ‘Having seen the noble one, he bestows upon me a hundred *peng*.’ What was gained was far more than a single pheasant! A wife like this—was it not enough to rejoice over?

Wu Can of Chu and Cai Tai Shi’s son, Zi Chao, were friends. Their sons, Wu Ju and Sheng Zi, were also close. Wu Ju married into the family of Wang Zi Nian, who later became Shen Gong and fled. The people of Chu said, ‘Wu Ju must have sent him away.’ Ju fled to Zheng and was about to proceed to Jin. Sheng Zi, intending to go to Jin, met him on the outskirts of Zheng. They spread out their mats and ate together, renewing their old friendship. Sheng Zi said, ‘You are departing—I will certainly restore you.’

Arriving in Song, Xiang Wu’s general was about to pacify Jin and Chu. Sheng Zi served as an envoy to Jin. Upon returning to Chu, Ling Yin Zi Mu asked, ‘Which is more virtuous, the ministers of Jin or those of Chu?’ He replied, ‘The ministers of Jin are not as virtuous as those of Chu—their great officers are all of ministerial caliber. Even if they were to attack with leather and hide, coming from Chu, though Chu may have talent, Jin would truly employ it.’

Zi Mu said, ‘Surely there are kinsmen among them?’ He replied, ‘Though there are, Chu’s talents are truly the ones being used. Now there is one even worse than Wu Ju marrying into Shen Gong. Shen Gong fled, and it was said that Ju had sent him away. Fearful, he fled to Zheng, stretching his neck southward, hoping for pardon—yet none came. Now he is in Jin, and the Jinese intend to execute him, comparing him to Chu Gou. If he conspires to harm Chu, would he not be a menace?’

Zi Mu feared this and spoke to the king, increasing his rank and restoring him. Sheng Zi sent Wu Jiao to welcome him back.

The record says: *"Sheng Zi’s assessment of Chu’s talents mirrors Li Si’s argument for retaining the exiles—his words and intent are identical. ‘If it is mine, I shall cherish it; if I do not cherish it, others will seize it’—the past serves as a warning. Learning from history is to caution the future.

To exhaust one’s abilities for today’s Wu Ju is to repay kindness; yet to fail to cherish talent tomorrow is to invite the fate of Wu Sha. One day, Zi Jin fled to He Men, and the men of Wu he employed were those praised by Gui Sheng. Jin then turned and gave them to others. Only then did the ‘spreading mats and renewing old friendships’ prove that, though bonds of friendship were not abandoned, the pity for talent and love of men were what the state must prioritize.

Perhaps this is not just about superficial exchanges of heart, but truly heeding the calamities of listening to slander and favoring the unworthy."*

Wu Yuan and Shen Bao Xu were friends. When Wu Yuan fled, he told Shen Bao Xu: *"I will surely avenge the state of Chu."* Shen Bao Xu replied: *"Endeavor, my friend. If you can avenge it, I will surely revive it."*

When King Zhao of Chu was besieged in Sui, Shen Bao Xu went to Qin to beg for aid, saying: *"The Lord of Heaven has made the Brute of Wu a long serpent, to offer it as tribute to the Central States. The suffering began with Chu, and my unworthy ruler lost his ancestral temple and domain. The state of Yue now dwells in the wilds, and I, your lowly subject, come to plead for help: The Brute’s insatiable greed is like a neighbor to your lordship, a menace to your borders. When Wu’s fate is yet undecided, I pray you take a share in its ruin. If Chu falls completely, its land will be yours. If your lordship’s spirit guides it, the world will serve you. The Qin sovereign sent him away with words of refusal.*

*"I have heard your plea," he said. "You have only just arrived at my court, yet you speak of plans before reporting them."* Shen Bao Xu answered: *"My unworthy ruler is still in the wilds, not yet having secured his allies. How dare I presume to rest?"* He stood by the courtyard wall and wept, day and night without ceasing, his voice unbroken. For seven days, he drank only from a ladle yet never let it pass his lips.

When the Qin lord saw this, he composed the ode *Wu Yi* ("No Garments") and, bowing nine times, agreed to send his troops. The record says: *"I observe the resolve of those in days gone by—how sharp it was! But today’s men, how weary they are in their thoughts. One state falls, another rises, yet they do not share in its fate. While you perish, my heart rejoices—why not let you perish? The times cannot be shaped by human will, and affairs cannot always be as one desires. They have weighed this well. Now, the harm of unchecked slander cannot be undone; the death of Wu Sha cannot be remedied. A whole clan was destroyed, and noble kin were slaughtered. How pressing were the hearts of filial sons and benevolent grandsires! If Shen Bao Xu had been in their place, with the same resolve, he would have met the same fate. When Yue had already taken the capital and the enemy had turned, the ancestral temple of Chu could not be altered. The king’s exile in the wilds was no longer constant, yet the hearts of loyal ministers and righteous warriors remained steadfast. If Wu Yuan had been in their place, with the same resolve, he would have achieved the same revival. Such was the clarity of their oaths and the firmness of their deeds—what they held in mind was already determined.*

Now, as for those who echo the words of the barbarians and rely on others to accomplish their ends—this is the work of mediocre, unprincipled men. Could they be compared to Wu Yuan and Shen Bao Xu?

From *Shiji* (*Records of the Grand Historian*): Su Wu and Li Ling were both attendants and court officials, close friends. Later, Ling surrendered to the Xiongnu, while Wu was detained and refused to yield. He was sent to the northern sea, where food ran out, and he survived by eating wild grass and gnawing on the roots of plants. His hair and beard fell out completely from neglect. The Xiongnu chanyu made a pact with him: *"Only when you accept a white ram as tribute shall you be allowed to return."* Ling, moved by this oath, set out wine and said: *"Life is like morning dew—why endure such suffering?"* Wu replied: *"My father and I have no merit or virtue, yet we were granted high rank as generals and marquesses. We have always vowed to spill our livers and brains for the state. Now we have the chance to fulfill this, and we truly rejoice. Do not speak further."* Thus, they drank together in harmony.

After several more days, Ling said again: *"I have already resigned myself to death. If Your Majesty insists on my surrender, let me first enjoy today’s feast, then I shall die before you."*

Moved by his sincerity, Ling sighed deeply and said: *"Alas! My crime with the Xiongnu chanyu is a transgression against Heaven itself."* He wept, his tears soaking his robes, and parted from Wu. Then he composed a poem:

*"The bow’s strength shines with virtue bright,
White-haired, yet still my pledge holds tight."*

Wu answered:
*"If I live, I shall return once more,
If I die, my love for you shall endure forever."*

The commentator records: *"In the beginning, Li Ling and Su Wu were not so different. Yet in the end, one became a noble minister, the other a traitor. The noble minister’s portrait graces the Hall of Eminent Worthies; the traitor, content to rot in obscurity. Then which brings greater joy—today’s fleeting pleasure or tomorrow’s enduring fame? True integrity is the grandest of all virtues; wealth and rank are but morning dew in a mortal’s life. Though Ling brought this upon himself, Sima Qian’s *Records* still weighs his loyalty in the scales of his heart. The bias against loyalty in *Records* is no accident. Alas! The ram may be milked, but the rotten cannot be revived. The pain of Sima Qian’s omission makes Wu’s persuasion of Ling all the more futile."*

From the *History of the Later Han*, it is told that **Fan Shi** of Mount Yang and **Zhang Yue** of Ru Nan, both young scholars at the Imperial Academy, swore to reunite after returning to their hometowns. Shi said to Yue: *"In two years, I shall return to pay my respects to your parents and see your children."* They fixed a day together.

When the appointed time came, Yue informed his mother and prepared a feast to await him. His mother said: *"Two years apart, a thousand miles between you—how reliable can such a promise be?"* Yue replied: *"Shi is a man of his word; he will not fail me."* His mother said: *"If so, then I shall brew wine for you."* On that very day, Shi arrived, ascended the hall, and bowed in greeting. They drank together in joy before parting.

Later, Shi served as a county magistrate, but Yue fell gravely ill and died. In a dream, Shi saw Yue say: *"I shall die on this day and be buried on that day. Do not forget me, though you cannot reach me."* Shi awoke in sorrow and hurried to attend the funeral. Before he arrived, the coffin had already been carried away. When he reached the grave and the mourners prepared to lower it, the coffin refused to move. His mother-in-law wept and said: *"Could Yue have hoped for this?"* The coffin remained still for some time, then a white carriage with black horses arrived, bearing a wailing figure. The mother-in-law exclaimed: *"It must be Fan Shi!"* Shi arrived, knelt at the coffin, and said:

*"Farewell, Yue. Life and death part us now,
Never to meet again on this mortal path."*

He took the funeral rope and led the procession forward.

The commentator records: *"Yue’s spirit, in death, was moved by what Shi had sworn in life. Life and death follow two paths, yet sincerity and spirit are one in essence. Thus, though unseen and unheard, sincerity persists; though unseen, the spirit’s influence endures. Only through sincerity does the spirit manifest; only through the spirit does response arise. Even sorcerers and diviners rely on this. The effects of ghosts and the power of spirits are but refined essences of our vital qi, the original guardians moving and responding within us. When one is moved, the other responds—naturally, without intent. Had Shi broken his oath of a thousand miles, Yue’s spirit would have been alienated in the unseen world. If Fan’s mother-in-law had doubted her son’s promise, her words at the grave would have been in vain. The *Book of Changes* says: ‘Without tokens, there is no trust.’ The hexagram *Inner Truth* declares: ‘The first nine, the *Yu* line, brings good fortune.’ This is the case of Jinxiang and Ru Nan."*

Jú Huī’s father, **Cén Shēn**, was a youthful friend of Emperor Guangwu in Chang’an. When Guangwu ascended the throne, he sought Shēn, but he had already passed. Thus, he summoned Huī and appointed him as a Gentleman of the Palace, later promoting him to Prefect of Linhuai. Huī was strict in governance, upright in conduct, and both officials and commoners revered and loved him. They sang of him:

*"Strong and just, he fulfills his duty,
A true son of Nanyang’s Zhu Ji."*

Zhang Kān, a fellow native of the same county, had long been renowned. While studying at the Imperial Academy, he had met Huī and held him in high regard, treating him as a brother. He once said to Huī: *"I entrust my wife and children to you."* Huī, though Kān was his senior, hesitated to accept, and afterward, they no longer saw each other. When Kān died, Huī learned that his family was in dire poverty. He went to visit them and provided generous aid. Huī’s youngest son, **Jié**, questioned him: *"Why did you not befriend Zhang Kān? You never even spoke to him in life."* Huī replied: *"Kān once spoke of me as a true friend, and I believed him."*

Again, from the same region, **Chén Yì** died young, leaving behind a posthumous son, **Yǒu**. Huī befriended him as if they had known each other for years. When **Huán Yú**, the Grand Tutor, served as Prefect of Nanyang, he summoned Huī’s son, **Pián**, to office. Huī declined and instead recommended Yǒu, who was then called to serve. Such was his integrity.

The commentator records: *"Since Guangwu’s strict adherence to principle, and the rise of Mount Yang and Ru Nan’s scholars, figures like Shēn and Huī have followed their example. Beyond this, the doctrine of absolute estrangement arises. Truly, the virtuous observe the changes of the age."*

Cái Yōng composed *The Treatise on True Friendship* to expand upon Zhū Mù’s ideals. Its essence states:

*"The virtuous man has no licentious friends,
His bonds are sincere, his oaths unshaken.
When Zhou’s virtue began to decline,
The *Ode of the Valley Wind* lamented betrayal—
Its cause was corruption in governance.
From then on, the decline deepened:
Some abandoned their principles from the start,
Others forced false harmony.
Some despised shallow men for their duplicity,
Others rejected friendships entirely.
Thus, the wise man is cautious in choosing friends,
And discerning in how he treats others.
Examine their origins, and you know their endings;
Observe their beginnings, and you foresee their conclusions."*

The virtuous and upright, though poor and lowly,
do not await wealth and honor—
and those who are wealthy and honored do not scorn the poor and lowly,
thus they are worthy of esteem.

Indeed, the Dao of friendship:
when there is *virtue*, they unite;
when there is no *virtue*, they part.
The good endure with lasting loyalty,
never forgetting their words of old,
while the wicked are admonished with sincerity
and guided toward the right path.

Thus, the virtuous do not practice actions worthy of abandonment,
nor do they grieve when others stray from them—
for they possess *virtue* worthy of return,
and do not lament when others keep their distance.

Should misfortune befall them,
they cultivate self-forgiveness
while holding others lightly accountable,
thus warding off resentment.

In days past, Zǐ Xià was of broad nature,
so the Master warned him to repel others,
while Zǐ Zhāng was narrow in disposition,
so he was instructed to embrace the multitude.

As for Zhōngní’s true teaching,
it was to love all universally while cherishing the virtuous.

Gǔ Liáng Zǐ said:
*"When hearts are unaligned and reputations unheard,
this is the fault of friendship."*

Now, if we fear its consequences,
we must block the source—
it is better to choose what is upright
and reject what is perverse,
to trust in the good
and abandon the evil together.

The record states:
*"Jú Gōngzǔ’s discourse on severing ties*
was a correction of the age’s superficiality,
spoken only when necessity demanded it.
Cài Bóxiè lamented Zháo’s words,
moved by how others treated him,
and thus spoke of it as well.

Yet if we abandon the principle of rejecting evil and embracing the good,
what remains?

Thus it is also said:
*"Those who scorn the shallow are broad and inclusive,
while those who sever ties are upright yet solitary.*
The solitary lamb preserves its integrity—
if it cannot be gained,
it flees, yet remains steadfast in its solitude.

These words are all the more true.

*The Book of Wèi* records:
Liáo Shù Gōng Yì Hēizǐ, favored by Emperor Tàiwǔ,
was dispatched to Bìngzhōu,
where he received a thousand bolts of cloth."

When the matter was exposed, Gao Yun consulted with the **Zhuòzuò Láng** **Gāo Yǔn** and said, *"The Sovereign inquires of me, and I should answer truthfully, yet fear to conceal it."* **Gāo Yǔn** replied, *"You are the favored attendant, and if you confess the truth, perhaps mercy may be shown. It would be unwise to deceive further."* The **Zhōngshū Shìláng** **Cuī Jiàn** **Gōng** **Sūn Zhì** declared, *"If you confess, the punishment will be incalculable. Better to conceal it."* **Hēizǐ** resented **Gāo Yǔn** and said, *"How could you lead me to this death?"* When **Hēizǐ** entered to see the Emperor, he did not speak the truth, and the Emperor executed him in anger.

The Emperor then ordered **Gāo Yǔn** to tutor the **Tàizǐ** in the Classics. At that time, **Cuī Hào** was arrested for his historical writings, and **Gāo Yǔn** was about to share his fate. The **Tàizǐ** said to **Gāo Yǔn**, *"When the Sovereign questions you, I will guide you to safety."* When the Emperor questioned him, the **Tàizǐ** spoke, *"Yun is cautious and humble, yet lowly in status. The decree came from Cuī Hào; I beg Your Majesty to spare his life."* The Emperor summoned **Gāo Yǔn** and asked, *"Are the records all the work of Cuī Hào?"* **Gāo Yǔn** answered, *"Your servant and Hào both composed them."* The **Tàizǐ**, fearing the Emperor’s wrath, said, *"Your Majesty’s authority is stern and grave. Yun, this humble subject, was confused and lost his bearings. All those questioned say it was Cuī Hào’s work."* The Emperor asked **Gāo Yǔn**, *"Do you confirm the words of the Eastern Office?"* **Gāo Yǔn** replied, *"Your servant’s crime deserves only a lesser punishment—he does not dare speak falsely. Your Majesty, in your long service as my tutor, has but once involved me, only to grant me life. In truth, Your Majesty did not question me, and I spoke no such words."* The Emperor turned to the **Tàizǐ** and said, *"Straightforward indeed—this man, even at death’s door, does not alter his words. He is a loyal subject who does not deceive his lord."* And so he pardoned him.

Later, the **Tàizǐ** reproached **Gāo Yǔn**, saying, *"I wished to save you from death, yet you would not comply. Why?"* **Gāo Yǔn** replied, *"Your servant and Cuī Hào truly shared responsibility for the historical records. In matters of life and death, honor and disgrace, it would be unjust to punish me alone. Though I owe Your Majesty kindness for sparing my life, I would not survive by betraying my conscience. My fate is not what I desired."* The **Tàizǐ** was moved by his words.

**Gāo Yǔn** later said to others, *"I did not follow the **Shù Gōng**’s guidance, lest I betray **Hēizǐ**."* The record states: *"**Gāo Bó Gōng** did not betray **Hēizǐ**, and this was his integrity. Yet he did not know that integrity is most valued when aligned with **righteousness (yì)**, and that one should take **righteousness** as the ultimate principle. **Hēizǐ**, with his greed and betrayal of trust, abandoned **righteousness** and dishonored his life—he was the first to be slaughtered and the leader of the guilt. Thus, confessing the truth led to death, and not confessing also led to death. Why then could **Hēizǐ** not simply conceal it, yet instead seek **Cuī Jiàn**’s **Sūn Zhì** to question him over every detail?

**Cuī Hào**’s private desires and his **Wèi Gōng**’s **Sūn Zhì**’s **mǐn zàn** (partiality in love and hate) obscured the truth—this was the people’s misfortune and Heaven’s punishment. Therefore, **Hēizǐ**’s death was just whether he confessed or not, yet why did he not perceive the danger and instead differ from **Mǐn Zhàn** **Pó Bāi** (those who remained steadfast in their principles)? Truly, **Gāo Yǔn** held **Dao/Way** and Buddhism in high regard, yet he lacked **Confucius**’s teachings as his foundation. His beliefs were not without flaw. If misfortune had befallen him, **Jǐng Mù**’s plea would have failed, and **Tàiwǔ**’s cruelty would not have ceased—then I would see only his ruin. Therefore, **Zōng Qīn** said, *"Yun was saintly."* I say, *"Yun was foolish."*

The *Book of Táng* records:
**Wú Jìng** and **Zhāng Yuè**, together holding the position of **Shǐ** (historian), were appointed to oversee the compilation of the *Zhēntiān Shílù* (True Record of Empress Wu). **Wú Jìng** wrote directly that **Wèi Yuán Zhōng** had served as Chancellor and frequently advised the two previous Emperors, receiving boundless favor. Now, though he held the Chancellorship, he could not fulfill his loyalty, allowing evil men to stand beside him—this was his crime. The Empress was displeased.

**Zhāng Yuè**’s associates, fearing her anger, then fabricated a record against **Yuán Zhōng**, claiming, *"The Empress has grown old; it would be better to enthrone the Prince as heir for a lasting dynasty."* The Empress was enraged and ordered his arrest, intending to interrogate him in court. **Chāng Zōng** secretly bribed **Fèng Gé Shèrén** **Zhāng Yuè** with a high office, instructing him to testify falsely against **Yuán Zhōng** in exchange for favor.

The next day, the Emperor issued a decree summoning **Yuán Zhōng**, the **Xiàng Wáng** (Prince), and the Chancellors for a joint interrogation. **Yuán Zhōng**’s guilt was debated back and forth without resolution. **Chāng Zōng** said, *"Let **Zhāng Yuè** be called, for he heard **Yuán Zhōng**’s words."* As **Zhāng Yuè** entered, **Sòng Yíng** said to him, *"Reputation and principle are most weighty—even spirits and gods cannot be deceived. Do not side with evil to ensnare the righteous, seeking only to escape punishment. If you are exiled or demoted, your honor will be great. If calamity befalls you, I will strike my chest and plead for you with all my strength, even if it means dying with you."* **Zhāng Yuè** was moved by his words and said, *"If Your Majesty grants me this chance, I will ensure future generations look up to me for this act."* The **Zǔoshǐ** **Liú Zhī Jǐ** said, *"Do not sully the annals of history, lest you burden your descendants."*

**Zhāng Yuè** then entered the court. The Empress questioned him, but before he could answer, **Chāng Zōng** pressed him from the side. **Zhāng Yuè** said, *"Your Majesty, if you scrutinize me in court like this, how much more would you question me outside!" I truly did not hear such words, but **Chāng Zōng** forced me to fabricate them in exchange for his favor.* Later, under similar circumstances, **Yuán Zhōng** was spared.

At this time, the historians saw **Zhāng Yuè**, who secretly prayed for changes in the records. **Wú Jìng** refused, saying, *"If I comply with your request, then this history will not be written with honesty. How can it then gain the trust of posterity?"* The record states: *"I observe the ancients in upholding integrity, even when pressed over minor details, yet they remained firm and did not yield to improper requests. Thus, the virtuous in their conduct must strive to have no regrets in their hearts. Only when there are no regrets in the heart can one then have no need to seek favor from others. **Zhāng Yuè**, having already betrayed **Sòng Yíng** with shameful death and burdened himself with **Yào Chóng**’s misdeeds, looked upward with guilt and downward with deeds of dishonor. Even if he could split a single hair in **Wú Jìng**’s records, could he escape the censure of all ages to come? Alas!"*

「Speaking from the perspective of the past, it is about **power**; speaking from the perspective of the future, it is about **gain**. **Power** and **gain**—how few can remain steadfast and unconfused! Is it only **Zhāng Yuè** who falters?

Li Huá held firm trust in **Yuán Déxiù**, **Xiāo Yǐngshì**, and **Liù Xuàn**’s characters, composing *The Treatise on the Three Virtuous Ones* and stating:
Déxiù’s resolve was to uphold the **Dao** in governing the world,
Xuàn’s was to harmonize the hearts of all with the Six Classics,
Yǐngshì’s was to transform the **mid-Qín** era into the present age.
Déxiù sought to equalize the wise and foolish,
Xuàn was moved by even a single thing not aligned with its proper **dharma**,
Yǐngshì adjusted his conduct with each breath to secure high office,
never forsaking even a moment’s ease.

Had Déxiù held the position of **teacher and guardian**,
his benevolence would be evident in his bearing.
Xuàn, dressed in the robes of a **ministerial aide**,
among guests and friends, plotted against the roots of chaos.
Yuán, drawing from the **primordial essence** (*yuánjīng*), revealed his subtlety.
Yǐngshì, like steel tempered a hundred times,
when faced with questions of rise and fall, departure and acceptance—life or death—
demonstrated his unyielding **virtue**.

Déxiù, in composing music for the king to venerate **virtue**,
reached the pinnacle of **heavenly and human harmony** (*tiānrén jīzhì*),
yet his literary works fell short—this was no **music of virtue** (*wúlè*).
Thus, he wrote *Breaking the Battle Array* to correct the **Zhōu** and **Shāng** traditions.
Xuàn, as a **historian** (*shìguān*), expounded the *Rites*, *Changes*, *Book*, *Poetry*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals* as the **Five Ancient Schools** (*gǔ wǔshuō*), tracing their lineage and documenting the shifts between past and present.
Yǐngshì, though his son **Cháng** was long without an annual biography,
wrote **biographies** (*lièzhuàn*) instead—later generations followed this, deeming it unconventional.

Yet each had flaws:
Yuán’s was **excessive drinking** (*jiǔ*),
Liù’s was **greed for material gain** (*shǎngwù*),
Xiāo’s was **overzealous censure of evil** (*biǎn'è tájí*), risking excessive severity,
but if one takes their **virtue**, all could serve as models for humanity.

The world called it a **sincere treatise** (*dǔlùn*).

The record states:
I observe the ancients’ **Dao of valuing friendship** (*shàng yǒu zhīdào*),
where each **perfected sage** (*zhìrén*) was distinct in his **virtue**.
Later generations, however, merely indulged in frivolous associations.
The **Dao of friendship** transcends mere **lofty counsel** (*cāncān*),
**harmonizing governance** (*jīnglún*), or **guiding the misled** (*biānzuò*).
**Zǐzhī**’s solitary conduct,
his **straight path** (*dàdào zhīxíng*), was to make the world **public** (*wèngōng*),
his **qi** reflecting the grandeur of **heavenly virtue**—a figure from before the **Three Dynasties** (*sāndài*).

**Mào Tǐng**’s resolute **virtue**,
even the **barbarians** (*yídí*) sought to emulate,
yet **China** itself did not.
**Jiéqīng**’s **family tradition** (*jiālù*), encompassing the **Dao of kings** (*huángwáng zhīdào*), was complete—
what need for later generations?

Li Huá’s **sincere trust** was well-founded.

**Volume 55 of *Principles of the Great Dao*** (*Hóngdào Lù*), originally titled *"Resentment"* (*Hèn*), revised based on context.
**Volume 56 of *Principles of the Great Dao* #1: *Trust***.」

**The Trust of Friends**

From *Song History*: Liu Anshi and Sima Guang were friends of the same year and age. After his younger brother’s death, Anshi declined an official post and returned to Luoyang. When Sima Guang asked him why, he replied: *"I have not yet attained sincerity."* Sima Guang rejoiced and invited him to join his circle. One day, he rose from his seat to ask: *"What is the essential principle of wholehearted conduct that one can follow for life?"* Sima Guang answered: *"It is sincerity."* He asked further: *"Where should one begin in practice?"* The reply came: *"Begin with never speaking falsely."* From then on, Anshi held fast to this principle, adhering to it all his life.

Later, when he was appointed to govern a prefecture and served as a judicial officer, the tax official was accused of corruption. The regional inspector, Hu Daogu, intended to investigate, but consulted Anshi first. Anshi declared: *"There is no corruption."* Though Hu Daogu hesitated, his conscience troubled him: *"The tax official is indeed corrupt, yet I did not answer truthfully—have I betrayed Master Sima’s teaching?"* Later, reading Yang Xiong’s *Fa Yan* ("The spoken law"), he found the line *"A gentleman avoids obstacles by aligning with principle,"* and his doubts were resolved.

Even in private, Anshi never showed laziness; he sat upright without leaning, wrote characters with precision, and took no pleasure in music, women, wealth, or gain—all mirroring Sima Guang’s conduct. Though he lamented the decline of worthy scholars, he remained steadfast, and his reputation grew ever stronger. Liang Shicheng admired his virtue and sent his son, Liang Wen, with a letter urging Anshi to accept office for the sake of his descendants. Anshi laughed: *"If I were thinking of my descendants, I would not have reached this point. I wish only to be a complete man of the Yuan You era, meeting Sima Guang in the underworld."* He returned the letter unopened.

The record states: *"Liu Anshi’s devotion to Master Wen [Sima Guang] was such that he stumbled and rose again, yet never wavered—until death, he still sought to meet him in the afterlife. Why?"* The *I Ching*’s *Wu Wang* (Hexagram 62) says: *"Without tilling, there is no harvest; without gathering, no assembly—yet there is advantage in going forward."* If one does not begin with sincerity and constancy, how can one remain unmoved by profit or swayed by power? Later, Li Guang, treating Anshi as his teacher, reported to Sima Guang: *"Learning must begin with *Wu Wang*."* This was the very meaning.

Thus it is said: *"Without sincerity, there is nothing. How can one who lacks self-trust trust others? How can one who lacks trust in life trust the dead?"* Alas, Anshi did not betray the teachings of the Sage’s school.

Chen Xiang, from his youth, was friends with his fellow villagers Chen Lie, Zhou Ximeng, and Zheng Mu—all men of ancient bearing and lofty conduct, their words sharp and precise, their resolve set on the weight of the world. At a time when scholars drowned in ornate calligraphy and dismissed *"knowing Heaven, fulfilling nature"* as absurd, these four men proclaimed their Dao in the coastal regions. Though initially mocked, they never wavered, and their steadfastness grew. They practiced sincerity in their families and extended it to the governance of their districts, and people came to trust them. Soon, their parents urged their children to follow them, and the scholars of Fujian revered them as the *"Four Masters."* Even those of reckless or arrogant nature dared not offend them.

The record states: *"At that time, Fujian’s learning was unheard of. The Four Masters, through their personal practice, led their fellow villagers, beginning with great difficulty but ultimately transforming the age. This was Heaven’s awakening of culture—a spontaneous harmony across the seas."*

She Liangzuo was one of deep sincerity and trust, studying under the Two Chengs [Cheng Yi and Cheng Hao]. One day, Cheng Yi said to him: *"You gather here, yet only study words—your heart and mouth do not align. Why not apply this to your conduct?"* Later, when parting from Cheng Hao, he returned after a year to ask: *"We have been separated for long—what progress have you made?"* Cheng Hao replied: *"I have only removed the character *jiān* [‘arrogance’ or ‘self-importance’]."* She Liangzuo asked: *"How so?"* He said: *"Examined closely, all suffering stems from this. If one subdues this fault, there is room for advancement."* Hu Wending asked: *"Why is *jiān* such a grave offense?"* She Liangzuo answered: *"People act only to impress others’ eyes and ears, caring nothing for their own benefit."* Cheng Hao rejoiced: *"You are one who strives in learning, questions earnestly, and reflects on the near—truly so!"* He added: *"Though fate may be humble, one must trust in it. Future efforts must be grounded in reality; fate cannot be bargained with by human calculation. I have never sought favor from others, nor in the Bureau did I curry influence with officials. When urged, I replied: ‘How can they shape me? My fate is my own.’ If trust is lacking, even a breeze stirs fear or joy—wasting effort and energy. But with trust, fate is nurtured, and qi remains unbroken."*

The record states: *"How is *jiān* such a great offense? Yu, the great Sage, said: ‘Do not be arrogant, and none will dispute your ability. Do not boast, and none will dispute your merit.’ Yan Hui, the great Virtuous One, said: ‘May I not praise my virtues, nor claim my labors—let others see me as shallow.’ Thus, one who is content with a single word or an inch of progress is truly unrestrained. But if one does not know their own insufficiency and only sees excess, this is the scholar’s great ailment—one that can never enter the Dao of Yao and Shun."* Alas, Shangcai’s [Cheng Yi’s] learning was so elevated, so just, that even the most upright could not surpass it. Scholars—how can they fail to reflect? How can they fail to strive?

Zhu Guangting first studied under Hu Angding, who taught him that the foundation of learning lies in *"upholding loyalty and sincerity."* He adhered to this all his life. Later, when he studied under the Two Chengs, others were astonished, but Zhu alone trusted without doubt, his learning and resolve unshaken as adamantine. His conduct was such that it could be measured by the divine—whether in governance or family, in dealing with the people or in affairs, in every action and stillness, it flowed from utmost sincerity.

「Discussing the ancients, how could their example be easily matched? His conduct was steadfast as a worthy minister, his bearing noble and upright, following the traditions of the historians. During the reigns of the **Qianxi (国一盒)**, **Yuanyou (元佑)**, and **Jingguo (靖国)**, affairs changed frequently, yet he was a man renowned across the land, attaining high office, and able to practice what he learned. However, upon closer examination of his deeds, there remained still some regret.

As for **Master Gong (公)**, one could say he was unwavering in his devotion, never losing it. **Liu Ruo (刘绚)** from the time of his first sprouting hair studied under the Two Chengs.

**Master Mingdao (明道)** once said to others: *"Others may have learning, but if they are not diligent, it is difficult to preserve. I have no doubt about this man’s resolve."*

**Master Yichuan (伊川)** also said: *"Many have entered my doors, but few are as steadfast in their belief, as thorough in their understanding, or as resolute in their practice as this one. Truly, such individuals are rare. His foundation in learning was unshaken, his grasp of profound truths subtle, and he labored tirelessly, knowing nothing else. His innate nature delighted in goodness and was never swayed by heterodox teachings, so his steps were secure. His inner life grew ever weightier without the turmoil of conflicting thoughts, thus his actions were firm. His aspirations aligned with those of Li Qixu (李吁志).*

Since the Two Chengs first expounded the **Dao Learning (道学)**, the world was astonished, yet these two could make scholars observe, emulate, and believe in their teachings with conviction.

**Master Lü Taijun (吕太钧)** was a man of simple sincerity and uprightness. He took the **Confucian Way (圣门)** as his own mission, and if he understood and believed in something with sufficient resolve to act upon it, he did so without hesitation or fear. Thus, those who knew him compared him to **Zilu (季路)**. He studied under **Zhang Zai (张载)**, and though he could uphold his teacher’s doctrines, he also implemented them in practice. He particularly favored elucidating the **Jingtian (井田)** and military systems, asserting that governance must begin here. Even when composing records for **illustrative diagrams (图籍)**, he ensured their practical utility, though all were rooted in Zhang’s teachings. He could firmly believe and act upon them. Zhang often sighed in admiration, saying he could not surpass him.

Yichuan further remarked: *"When Master He (和叔) and I meet, there is no need for further recognition. But once parted, I cannot help but doubt him. Yet I do not know if he truly remains undoubting. Nor do I know if, after he no longer doubts, he will still harbor doubts when separated from me."*

Mingdao then asked: *"Why not ask him what he doubts?"*
He added: *"Master He’s sincerity and straightforwardness are such that he firmly believes. That is why he is steadfast in his faith."*

**Master Gong** recorded: *"Since the time of the Confucian School (孔门) teaching others, it is only now that scholars truly recognize the Dao of the Sage (圣人) and yearn toward it. If one does not firmly believe and resolutely act, then it is mere ‘Jiang’er Learning’ (江耳之学), which benefits neither one’s body nor mind. How can it be guaranteed that such a person will not suddenly change, let alone remain steadfast throughout life? This is most crucial in the Dao Learning tradition, yet it is something the Confucian scholars of old—like Kong, Zeng, and Shang—exhaustively discussed in the *Analects (论语)*. Now we see it again."*

**Yang Wanli (杨万里)**, from his first meeting with **Zhang Zhongxian (张忠献)**, was exhorted to study **upright-heart and sincere-intent (正心诚意)**. He accepted this teaching wholeheartedly, naming his study hall the **Sincere Hall (诚斋)**. In the twelfth year of **Chunxi (淳熙)**, during an earthquake, he submitted a memorial stating: *"I have heard that speaking truthfully during times of peace is not harmful, but speaking falsely during times of crisis is gravely so. The affairs of the realm have roots and branches. What I have previously submitted were merely the branches. The true roots lie in the ruler not acting from personal whim. If the ruler acts from personal whim, then ministers cannot bear responsibility. Today’s affairs will have no precedent. This is the lofty principle of the Sage’s teaching, and I wish to further ponder its original essence."*

When he was transferred to attend the **Imperial Academy (束宫)** as a **sitting reader (侍读)**, he advised the **Prince of the Heir Apparent (太子)** on matters as they arose, and the prince deeply respected him.

When **Emperor Gaozong (高宗)** passed away, **Emperor Xiaozong (孝宗)** intended to observe a three-year mourning period and established the **Hall of Consultation (议事堂)**, commanding the **Heir Apparent (皇太子)** to participate in state affairs. Yang Wanli submitted a memorial forcefully opposing this. Before Gaozong’s burial, **Han Hu (韩怩冑)**, the **Chancellor (翰林学士)**, and **Hong Mai (洪迈)** did not await the collective deliberation and ancestral rites, but instead submitted the names of **Lü Xihao (吕熙浩)** and others alone. Yang Wanli wrote a memorial denouncing them, even going so far as to say, *"There is no difference between this and pointing at a deer and calling it a horse."* Xiaozong was displeased and remarked: *"What kind of ruler does Yang Wanli think I am?"* He was then exiled to **Junzhou (筠州)**.

Han Hu, wielding excessive power, sought to entrap and control scholars across the land. He constructed a **Southern Garden (南园)**, commissioning Yang Wanli to write its record in exchange for a recommendation to the **Imperial Academy (掖垣)**. Yang replied: *"The office can be abandoned, but the record cannot be written."* Han Hu’s arrogance grew even greater, leading Yang to fall gravely ill with worry and distress.

When his relatives knew the cause, they kept all official dispatches from him. Suddenly, a nephew arrived from outside, urgently declaring news of military mobilization and conflict. Yang Wanli wept uncontrollably, gasping for breath, and quickly summoned paper to write: *"The wicked ministers have no bounds. They provoke wars, harm the people, and endanger the state. My head is like this—there is no way for me to repay the country, only my solitary resentment."* He then wrote fourteen more words, bade farewell to his wife and children, and died as the pen fell.

**Emperor Guangzong (光宗)** once inscribed the characters **Sincere Hall (诚斋)** for him, and scholars thereafter called him **Sincere Hall Master (诚斋先生)**.

**Master Gong** recorded: *"Zhang Zhongxian’s relationship with Yang Wanli was akin to that of Fan Zhongwen (范文正) with Hengxu (横渠). Such mentorship in perfecting later generations is rare among the ancients. If one could merely acknowledge the Dao in the teacher’s hall but fail to internalize it in oneself, would that not be futile? Now, observing Yang Wanli’s responses to imperial edicts, one sees the earnest principle of preparing beforehand to establish, or failing to do so will result in ruin. His memorial on the **Regency (监国)** was heartfelt, echoing the words ‘Heaven has no two suns, the people no two kings.’ Even when facing the ruler’s misguided favoritism and the peril of heterodox support for the state, he died content, not doubting even in the face of death. Is this not one who ‘dies without regret’? The name Sincere Hall is indeed well-deserved.*

**He Ji (何基)** was steadfast in his faith. **Huang Gan (黄干)**, whose father **Huang Bofen (黄伯焚)** served as **Magistrate of Linchuan County (临川县丞)**, saw that at the time, Gan was studying **filial piety (丝事)**. Huang Bofen, delighted by his son’s sincerity, took him as his teacher. Gan instructed him that one must first cultivate a **true and genuine heart-mind (真实心地)**, then refine through **bitter toil (刻苦工夫)**. He Ji received this command with solemn resolve.

Thus, Gan guided him through every matter, helping him attain the **profound essence (渊源之懿)**. He explored subtle nuances and profound truths, delving deeply into meditation, calming his heart and regulating his **qi (气)**, awaiting enlightenment without ever imposing his own views or deviating for personal gain. He was thus called a **simple and sincere man (平狗人)** with little change in his ways.»

In whatever studies he undertook, he would meticulously annotate and punctuate, rendering meaning clear and self-evident without need for further exposition. He often said:

*"In learning, establishing resolve must be firm, and one’s vision must be grand. One must embody and practice with unwavering dedication, persisting until death. When reading the **Odes (《诗》)**, one must first purge the mind of encumbrances, then recite and chant with ease, allowing its words to stir the heart—only then does study bear fruit. In studying the **Changes (《易》)**, one must discard rigid and fragmented interpretations, purifying the mind to explore subtle principles. Through profound meditation and immersion, one grasps its roots, only then may one gradually discern the **trigrams (爻象)**.*

*He adhered strictly to his teacher’s instructions, refining his understanding with precision, like a comparison. When Wang Xiang became his disciple, his brilliance and sharp insight shone through in his expansive arguments and eloquent debates. Even when questioning doubts—sometimes returning to a single matter ten times—He Ji never wavered, awaiting resolution with steadfastness. He once remarked: ‘In studying the Classics, one must focus on careful contemplation, not excessive speculation. For those who would instruct later learners, caution must be doubled.’*

*He recorded: ‘Confucius said: **“Sincere in faith, loving of learning (笃信好学).”**’ Its explanation reads: ‘Without sincerity, one cannot truly love learning. Yet sincerity without learning may lead one astray from truth.’ This is why the lineage of the Four Masters—He, Wang, Jin, and Xu—remained unbroken in its essence.*

*Alas! The teachings of the Western River (西河) were transmitted directly from the Great Sage’s lineage, yet his followers distorted them through blind imitation. How much more so under the suppression of false doctrines and rigid prohibitions! Thus, he approached his studies with utmost diligence, unyielding in tenfold inquiry until clarity emerged.*

Wang Xiang’s great-grandfather, Wang Yu, studied the **Changes (《易》)** and the **Analects (《论语》)** under Yang Shi. Later, he also learned from Zhu Xi, Zhang Shou, and the brothers Lü Zuqian and You Wenhan.

Young, Xiang admired Zhuge Liang’s character, adopting the sobriquet *Changxiao Erdie* (长啸二蝓). At thirty, he realized the source of his family’s learning and sighed: *“Changxiao*—this is not the special reverence of the Sage’s Gate. I must now follow the teachings of Lu Zhi.”

Someone mentioned that He Ji had received the transmission of Zhu Xi, so Xiang sought him out. Ji taught him the principles of **establishing resolve and dwelling in reverence (立志居敬)**, and Xiang embraced them with wholehearted sincerity, steadfast and unyielding. Whenever doubts arose, he would consult Ji without fail.

Xiang once said: *“The **River Diagram (河图)** used to arrange the **Eight Trigrams (八卦)** through odd and even positions, while the **Later Heaven sequence (后天)** unified them as a whole. Only the **Four Generations (四生数)** remain fixed, forming the basis for the **Fourfold Numbers (四成数)**, ascending and descending—even and odd, all in accordance with Nature.”*

He further stated: *“Great Yu received the **Lu Diagram (洛书)** and arranged the **Nine Categories (九畴)**, while Ji Zi passed down the **Nine Categories** as the **Great Plan of the Five Powers (洪范)**. The numerical patterns of the **Five Powers** unknowingly align with the **Great Plan**—this is the essence of the Classics and commentaries. The first line begins with **Five Phases (五行)**, followed by sixty-five characters as the **Great Plan of the Five Powers**, then sixty-four characters as the **Plan of the Five Powers (皇极经)**. This is the grand tradition passed down by emperors, not Ji Zi’s words alone.”*

He also said: *“The **Three Hundred Odes (《诗》三百篇)** were not all finalized by the Master. Some deleted poems may still exist, and Han scholars supplemented the lost with their selections. Thus, the **Southern Odes (二南)** were set at ten each, *He Bi Naiyi (何彼秾矣)* was reassigned to *Gantang (甘棠)*, *Wild Goat (野有死麝)* was removed from the **King’s Odes (《王风》)**, and the licentious poems of Zheng and Wei were censored. The **Spring and Autumn Annals (《春秋》)** were then expanded upon.”*

*“The chapter on **extending knowledge and investigating things (致知格物)** in the **Great Learning (《大学》)** was lost, and the chapter on **stopping at knowledge (知止)** was placed above the section on adjudicating disputes. The original **Doctrine of the Mean (《中庸》)** consisted of two sections. **Sincerity and Enlightenment (诚明)** should serve as the framework, not mere details. The final text was set at eleven chapters each for **Doctrine of the Mean** and **Sincerity and Enlightenment**.”*

His profound insights were of this caliber.

He recorded: *“Wang Hui’s reflection on principles was indeed a model of scholarly rigor. Yet he was ultimately renowned for his clarity and insight—was this not the interplay of **foolishness revealing wisdom, softness overcoming strength**?”*

Though his writings were voluminous and his debates rich, they were not without foundation. Thus, scholars must prioritize **grasping the essential**. Mastering the essential allows one to adhere to brevity, and brevity suffices to encompass the vast.

Though *Changxiao* emphasized stillness, it was merely a means. Without stillness, one cannot attain the distant. Yet **delving into subtle principles and establishing resolve in reverence**—these are but two aspects of one path.

The **Yuan History (《元史》)** states: *“Jin Liuxiang, from his youth, adhered to the teachings of the School of Principle (濂洛之学). He served Wang Xiang of the same prefecture and once asked about the method of study. Xiang instructed him: ‘Nothing precedes establishing resolve. Resolve stands beyond things, and reverence dwells within them—this is the great method of learning.’*

*“When the Song Dynasty’s cause was beyond redemption, he abandoned worldly ambitions, secluding himself in the Jinhua Mountains. He pursued clouds and moonlight, finding solace in whistling, detached from worldly affairs. In solitude, he maintained an upright demeanor, embodying **dwelling in reverence to uphold resolve, establishing resolve to fortify the foundation**. Truly at ease, yet when interacting with others, his demeanor was harmonious and respectful. He tirelessly guided later learners with earnest patience.*

*“He often said: ‘Liu Shu’s **External Records (外纪)** lack foundation in the Classics, instead relying on the sayings of a hundred schools. This contradicts the Sage’s teachings and is unworthy of trust. Before Yao, what the Master did not establish cannot be verified; the **Spring and Autumn Annals** recorded only what was conveyed through jade and silk—no additions could be made by later historians.’*

*“Thus, he adopted the **Royal Extremes of the Great Plan (皇极经世历)** by Shao Kang and the **Grand Framework of the Sovereign (皇王大纪)** by Hu Angu, adjusting and reconciling them. Primarily relying on the **Book of Documents (尚书)**, he extended his research to the **Odes (《诗》)**, **Rites (《礼》)**, and **Spring and Autumn Annals (《春秋》)**, supplementing with chronicles and biographies from ancient histories and the **Records of the Grand Historian (《史记》)**, arranging events by year. Beginning with Emperor Tang Yao and continuing to the **Zizhi Tongjian (《通鉴》)**, he compiled a work titled **Preface to the Comprehensive Mirror (《通鉴前编》)**.”*

「In all cases where he cited sources, he would immediately annotate and elucidate them to clarify their meaning, often uncovering insights that earlier Confucian scholars had overlooked. After completing his work, he entrusted it to a worthy recipient—**Master Xu Qian**—who remarked: *“The grandeur of the Two Sovereigns and Three Kings should be emulated by later rulers; the harsh laws and chaotic schemes of the Warring States period and the Shang Dynasty must be heeded as warnings by those who follow, so this compilation cannot be disregarded.”*

At that time, critics observed: *“His personal conduct was pure and upright, akin to the integrity of **Yin He** and **Jing** [the recluse]; his governance was lofty and resolute, resembling that of **Xie Shangcai** [Xie Shang of Shangcai]. Yet he absorbed the teachings of both **Lin Lixiang** and **Fu Yizhi** while refining them into his own approach.”*

The record states: *“When **Master Ren Shan** expounded the **Dao**, was he merely echoing **Master Xu Yun**’s discussion of **Little Sima** [Sima Qian]?”*

**Sima Tan**, the Grand Historian, explicitly declared that the *Book of Documents* alone recorded events from **Emperor Yao** onward, while the **Hundred Schools** spoke of **Yellow Emperor**, whose accounts were unrefined and improper. **Master Yan Sheng** found them difficult to accept, and **Master Zheng Naihe** dared not supplement them. Thus, **Heavenly Sovereign (天皇氏)**, **Earthly Sovereign (地皇氏)**, **Human Sovereign (人皇氏)**, **Nüwa (女娲氏)**, **Suiren (燧人氏)**, and **Pangu (盘古氏)**—among others—proliferated in conflicting versions, all originating from **Zheng’s** school. Later, **Hu Wufeng** and **Hu Shuangfeng**, though self-proclaimed Confucians, further distorted and misaligned these traditions—no wonder **Qin’s** scholars and **Emperor Wu of Liang** rejected them!

Even the **Shouwei School**, which included **Pangu** and six other figures in its early sections and **Fu Yi** and eight others in its later ones, totaling **fourteen sovereigns**, left unclear distinctions between the **Three Sovereigns** and **Five Emperors**.

Now, I propose to eliminate all such discrepancies and establish the *Preface to the Comprehensive Mirror* as definitive—this is the proper course.

**Xu Qian**, a disciple of **Lin Lixiang**, once said to him: *“A scholar’s learning should be like the five flavors blending into harmony; once the fermentation and seasoning are applied, the distinctions of sour and salty become pronounced. Yet you still treat me as a layman—does this mean my studies have failed to awaken you?”*

Upon hearing this, **Xu Qian** was deeply stirred and, over the course of several years, mastered all the profound teachings his master had transmitted. He read every text thoroughly, never forcing interpretations where they were unclear, and if any passage seemed unsatisfactory, he would not hastily agree with it.

To other scholars, he declared: *“Learning must take the **Sages** as its standard. Yet one must first grasp the Sage’s intent before attempting to emulate their deeds.”*

In his study of the *Odes*, he composed the *“Annotations on Names and Objects”* to correct pronunciation and exegesis, examining the names and measurements of things to supplement what earlier Confucians had overlooked, while preserving their obscure meanings. He drew from distant sources and concluded each analysis with his own reflections.

For his examination of history, he produced *“Critical Moments of Governance,”* following the **Historian’s** method of recording events by year and by nation, beginning with **Taizong (太嗥氏)** and ending with **Sima Guang’s** death in the **Song Dynasty’s Yuan You era (宋元佑)**. He believed that with Sima Guang’s passing, China’s restoration could no longer be revived—this was indeed the critical juncture of decline.

He also compiled *“Self-Reflection Records,”* where he recorded his actions by day and, if they were unworthy, refrained from doing them at all. He opened his doors to teach, welcoming students from afar—even from **Yuyang, Jizhi, Qi, and Lu**—and nearby—from **Jing, Yang, and the regions of **Hao** and **Yue****. He never tired of instructing them, regardless of their origins.

In his teaching, he was earnest and meticulous, ensuring that his students’ understanding was thorough, both in doctrine and practice. He often said: *“If I possess knowledge and can impart it to others, why should I not rejoice?”*

When students posed difficult questions that they struggled to articulate, he would clarify their intended meaning and resolve their doubts. His lectures and debates lasted all day without fatigue, guiding coarse learners toward subtlety, while those who were sharp were restrained, the rigid were liberated, and the wayward were brought back to discipline. He adapted to each student’s abilities, ensuring they made progress accordingly.

Yet he never taught the **examination essays** of the **imperial civil service**, declaring: *“Such writings stem from mercenary motives and cannot be reconciled with true learning.”*

He was deeply devoted to filial piety and brotherly love, exhibiting conduct beyond the ordinary. In his interactions with the world, he neither rigidly adhered to antiquity nor blindly followed contemporary trends.

During the **Great Virtue era (大德中)**, the **wandering star (Uranus, 荧惑)** entered the **Southern Dipper (南斗)**, and **Xu Qian** interpreted this as a calamity for **Hao and Chu (昊楚)**. He secretly pondered the coming misfortune. That year, the **Great Flood (大侵)** struck, and the people suffered further loss from famine and disease.

Someone asked him: *“Is this not due to insufficient food?”*

**Xu Qian** replied: *“Now, both the public and private granaries are depleted, and the **Dao** and its adherents face mutual suspicion. How can I alone remain well-fed?”*

His inner resolve was indeed such.

The record states: *“My observations of **Xu Baiyun’s** concerns align with yours, yet he neither clung to antiquity nor followed contemporary trends. For one who clings to antiquity, the **wandering star’s** anomalies would not be confined to the **Great Flood**; for one who follows trends, the calamity of **Hao and Chu** would not necessarily strike close to home. But **Xu** understood the Confucian heart: the heavens, earth, all things, China and the **Four Barbarians**, none were excluded from his purview. The **Dao of Heaven** and human affairs were all subjects he diligently studied.

Initially, his teachings were not the kind suited for **imperial examinations**, nor could those focused solely on **examination categories** comprehend them. His critiques of China’s flaws and his warnings against the **barbarians** were subtly woven into *“Critical Moments of Governance”*; yet his efforts to uphold **orthodox learning**, restore the **fundamental principles**, and his deep engagement with the **essence of Buddhism and Daoism** were equally evident.

This is why he was worthy of bearing the weight of **correct studies**, and why his personal safety or misfortune mirrored the rise or decline of this **Dao** itself.*

In the early **Ming Dynasty**, **Master Zhao Kaogu** traced **Xu Qian’s** lineage to the **Sixth-generation grandson of Song Emperor Xingzong (宋秦王)**, while his own family had remained uninvolved in government service since entering the **Yuan Dynasty**. **Xu Qian**’s distant ancestors were from **Mifu (沬泗)**, and his recent teachers were from **Guanshan (关问)**. He was sincere in his adherence to the **Dao** and diligent in its study.

At the beginning of the **Hongwu era (洪武初)**, he was summoned to the capital. Upon returning home, he built **Kaogu Terrace (考古台)** and composed *“The Unified Treatise on Sounds, Scripts, and Meanings”* in **one hundred volumes**, expounding upon the **Six Classics** and the **Hundred Schools**. He claimed his work revealed the **profound and divine insights** of the **Sages**, though contemporaries did not accept his assertions.

Only **Song Jinglian** instructed his son **Song Zhongshi** to study under **Xu Qian**, along with **Song Jizi of Jiangxi**, **Lin Fu of TianTai**, and **Tang Xinshi**, who all agreed that his teachings were sound. **Hou Yong**, a **Minister of Personnel (吏部侍郎)**, treated him with the respect due to a master.

Later, when **Xu Qian** returned to the capital, the court officials declared that **sagely orthodox learning** from beyond the seas had never been heard of before, and that he should be sent to teach in **Qiongzhou (琼州府学教授)**.»

When he arrived, he established the **Jongtai Learning Framework**, expounding the **Patterns of Transformation and Governance**, compiling and supplementing the works of former sages, recording teachings according to their objects, and taking it upon himself to revive and elevate this **Way**.

Though barbarian and armed tribesmen turned toward his teachings in reverence, scholars from distant lands did not hesitate to cross mountains and seas to follow him. Among them were **Zheng Shangbin of San Mountain**, **Wang Zhongdi of Hefei**, **Zhu Bishao of Putian**, **Sun Zhongyue of Fengyang**, and **Hao Wenxiang of Jongtai**, all of whom revered him as their master.

**Qiu Wenzhuang Gong** held him in particular devotion, for it was only after **Xu Qian** that **Jongzhou** came to recognize **sagely learning**.

Wenzhuang initially found **Zhu Xi’s** subtle teachings scattered in commentaries and recorded sayings, which were difficult for scholars to grasp. He thus gathered the most precise passages into twenty chapters, composing *The Principles of Learning* (*Xue de*).

For *The Outline of Principles* (*Gangmu*), he took **orthodox succession** as his foundation, acknowledging that **Qin and Sui** could not be hastily deprived of their legitimacy, nor could **Han and Tang** be hastily granted it, thus writing *The Rectified Framework of World History* (*Shishi Zhenggang*).

Though *The Family Rituals* (*Jiali*) preserved the essence of reverence and sincerity, its rites were incomplete, so he composed *The Ritual Complements of Family Etiquette* (*Jiali Yijie*).

Since *The Extended Meanings of the Great Learning* (*Daxue Yan Yi*) lacked guidance on **governing the state and pacifying the world**, he drew from the **Classics, Histories, and Masters**, adding his own interpretations, and wrote *Extended Meanings* (*Yanyi*).

These were his greatest contributions to the **Four Books**.

At the **Imperial College**, he strictly followed the established precedents of **Li Zhongwen**, yet refined and systematized them with meticulous care. None could surpass his mastery.

In high office, he sought to broaden the emperor’s perspective with **magnanimity**, fostering **loyalty and benevolence** among scholars. In all matters of personnel advancement or dismissal, as well as policy implementation or reform, he adhered strictly to ancestral precedents.

When compiling the **Imperial Annals of the Ying Temple**, he boldly spoke of **Yu Qian’s** wrongful accusation, and only then did others believe the truth, allowing his deeds to be accurately recorded.

In overseeing the **Ministry of Personnel’s** performance evaluations, he was known for dismissing many officials. Those dismissed dared not complain, but he deeply understood the flaws in the system and reported to the throne:

*"In the ages of Yao and Shun, officials were assessed every three years, and those failing were dismissed after three evaluations. Now, some officials are dismissed before even half a year in office, based merely on hearsay, not necessarily truth."*

The emperor agreed. When the Ministry proposed dismissing nearly two thousand officials—some not yet three years in service, others though evaluated three times but lacking clear evidence of corruption—he ordered none be dismissed. This was in accordance with the master’s words.

The record states:
*"I observe that **Zhao Kaogu** deceived the former dynasty, refusing office under the Yuan. Though he claimed his writings contained profound and divine insights, few accepted them. Had it not been for the **Great Clarity of the Ming**, honoring true scholars and promoting **Daoist learning**, how could his words have been fully trusted? Since then, the **Four Seas** have united in shared culture, and soon after, **Wenzhuang** emerged—deeply enlightened and devoted. He applied this learning to his conduct and governance, aiding the **glorious Ming**. It is evident that the former dynasty could not partake in this **Way**, yet the **Four Seas** now flourish in civilization. Where did this transformation originate?"*
