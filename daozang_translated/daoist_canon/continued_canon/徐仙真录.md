**Preface to *The True Records of the Xu Immortals***

When heaven endows a person with extraordinary talent and they apply it in their time, they may serve their lord with loyalty, protect the people, and attain illustrious rank and honor. Even after death, their temple is venerated in their homeland, and their hidden merits and numinous blessings continue to manifest in later generations—this is no mere coincidence. For heaven must have a purpose for this world and its people, guiding them to such an end. Otherwise, how could they be so unlike others? As for the two Xu Immortals, their case is plainly evident.

The Divine Immortals were natives of Xiong Mountain in Haizhou. They descended from the lineage of King Yan. Their father, Xu Wen, was a renowned general of Wu during the Five Dynasties period. Through his military achievements, he rose through the ranks, eventually being appointed as chancellor. Upon his death, he was posthumously enfeoffed as the Prince of Qi and granted the posthumous title *Zhongwu* ("Loyal and Martial"). All five of his sons received princely titles. Among them were Xu Zhizheng and Xu Zhikua—these were the two Immortals.

During the Tianfu era, the Tang sovereign received the abdication of the throne. Zhizheng was enfeoffed as the Prince of Jiang, and Zhikua as the Prince of Rao. Together, they governed Jinling, their virtue and authority jointly flourishing, bringing peace to the people. They led troops into Min, where the barbarian bandits surrendered, and the borders became tranquil.

The people of Min revered and followed them; thus, they established a shrine to the living deities north of Aofeng, installing statues to honor and serve them. Moved by their sincerity, the deities one day addressed the people of Min: "Next year, I shall depart from you all, but I will silently protect this land." True to their word, the people of Min grew even more devout in their reverence. Whenever disasters struck—droughts, floods, locust plagues, or perils like fires, banditry, and theft—whenever illness, marriages, or funerals required prayers, their supplications were answered as swiftly as an echo. Their literary compositions and calligraphy shone like the radiant Milky Way, dazzling the eyes and ears.

Since the Song dynasty, the deities have received numerous honorific titles. By the Yongle era of our present dynasty, in recognition of their merit in safeguarding the sacred person of the Emperor during his indisposition, their temple was newly renovated. An imperial stele was commissioned, and their posthumous honors were further augmented to manifest the deities' benevolence. From this, we may observe that in life, they were loyal ministers, and in death, enlightened deities—such was the magnitude of their virtue and merit, benefiting both the state and the people. Could this not be the intent of Heaven for this world and its people, that they should attain such a state?

The temple official Fang Wenzhao compiled a record encompassing the deities' lineage, deeds, miraculous manifestations, literary works, and the imperial honors and steles bestowed upon them by previous dynasties and our present court, fearing that with the passage of time, these might fade into obscurity. He titled it *The True Record*. Sun Mengcheng, the military commander of Min and a man of loyalty and righteousness, having read it, was deeply moved. He donated his salary to commission artisans to carve and print the work, ensuring its wider dissemination, and tasked me with writing a preface.

I say: the deities were wise, upright, and just. Their wondrous deeds, both past and present, never strayed into obscurity, eccentricity, or deceit—never did they mislead the world or deceive the people. All their actions were those of loyalty to the sovereign, filial piety to parents, benevolence toward the people, and care for all things—precisely what a scholar-official ought to do. Those who have witnessed or heard of these deeds firsthand need not rely on this compilation to know them. Yet for those in distant and remote regions who have not yet learned of them, this work may serve as a fortunate guide, offering aid in the Way of being a loyal minister and filial child, and in the methods of cultivating oneself and conducting affairs with caution.

Thus, this preface.

Written on an auspicious day in the seventh month of autumn, the eighth year of the Zhengtong era (1443), by Wang Yongsheng, Instructor of the Confucian School of Min County, Fujian.

**Preface to the Reprinted *True Record of the Xu Immortals***

*The True Record of the Xu Immortals* chronicles the deeds of the Two Perfected Lords of Vast Grace and Numinous Aid. Within its pages are portraits, the origins of their imperial honors from previous dynasties, and the edicts of our Taizong Wen Emperor commanding the construction of their palace-temple, along with his imperial stele inscriptions. It includes the laudatory verses from *The Book of Hidden Virtue for Doing Good*, the successive imperial decrees of enfeoffment, the rituals of sacrificial offerings, the eulogies of praise, the veneration of successive sages, the bestowal of ceremonial robes, and the literary works composed by the Perfected Lords through spirit-writing—ancient rhapsodies, records, prefaces, poems, divination slips, and resplendent calligraphy—all radiant with celestial brilliance, illuminating past and present.

The temple officials, including Fang Wenzhao, compiled and assembled these materials into two volumes, totaling several scrolls, to record the Perfected Lords' divine transformations in governing the cosmos, their merits in enriching the state and benefiting the people, their silent protection of the sacred person, their unseen support of imperial authority, and their numinous responses and wondrous manifestations—all meticulously documented.

This work was previously printed, but the edition has long since faded beyond recognition and lacks the completeness of the present version. It has now been edited, collated, transcribed, and expanded, and will be reprinted to ensure its wider transmission.

Over the years and months, my strength proved insufficient for the task. Then, by fortunate coincidence, General Sun Jingkang of Mengcheng, the Venerable Guardian of the State, arrived in Futang to assume command of the regional garrison. Soon after taking residence, he personally paid homage to the Perfected Lord at the ancestral temple on Aofeng, offering solemn rites with reverent prostration and libations—whereby the divine and human realms were joined in mutual trust.

Upon the completion of the ceremony, the General took up this compilation and read it with joyous admiration. Moved by its contents, he gladly contributed his own resources, determined to ensure its carving into print, that the Perfected Lord’s numinous traces might be illuminated for eternity. As soon as the project was sheltered under his patronage, he commanded me to compose a preface in commemoration.

I purified myself with fasting and ablutions, lit incense, and pored over the text for days on end. Through this, I came to know that the Perfected Lord’s accumulated merits and boundless benevolence, his utmost loyalty and perfect filial piety, his aspiration for the Dao and attainment of immortality, and his beneficence in aiding all beings—all these true traces are fully preserved within these pages, without omission or lack, destined to endure across ten thousand ages without fading.

Yet, as I reflect upon this, I am struck by a thought: before its carving, the eyes of the world had not seen it, nor had the ears of the world heard of it.

Now that it has been carved, it seems that within the Four Seas and across the Eight Directions, those afflicted with deafness find their ears opened to clarity, and the blind find their eyes restored to sight—nothing remains unseen, nothing unheard. In this world and among its people, those who recite this book and ponder its principles will all come to admire the Perfected Lord’s lofty virtue and distant footsteps, his loyalty and filial piety, his cultivation of virtue and practice of goodness, aspiring to ascend the immortal’s steps and rise to true enlightenment in the Dao.

Thus, it becomes evident that the Perfected Lord not only perfected himself in kalpas past but will also deliver beings in the boundless kalpas to come. Moreover, observing Lord Sun’s intent in this endeavor, one sees his sincere love of goodness, his understanding of the rites of revering Heaven and serving the divine, his loyalty to the sovereign and love for his kin, and his profound veneration of the Perfected Lord’s Dao—qualities no other could match.

Alas! Even a single good thought may move the azure heavens, how much more so when such great goodness as this is manifest? Truly, it deserves to be recorded. The *True Record* is detailed and complete, now forming a comprehensive work. Its opening includes prefaces by the former Right Administration Commissioner of Fujian, Lord Ma of Fengyang, and various scholars; I shall not repeat them here but merely recount the sequence of its concealment and revelation, along with the date of its recent reprinting.

Respectfully inscribed on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the year *xinyou* of the Zhengtong reign (1441) by Zhu Hui of Xin’an, humble student and Magistrate of Tong’an County, Quanzhou Prefecture, with hands bowed in reverence.

**Preface to the *True Record of Master Xu***

Ninety *li* south of the Three Mountains of Min lies Jin’ao Peak, its towering heights piercing the clouds and soaring beyond the mortal realm. At its foot stands the immortal shrine of the Perfected Lord of Numinous Aid. When I assumed office as regional administrator and took up governance, I once led my subordinates to pay homage at the shrine. Its steps and halls were elegant and refined, the divine countenance solemn and majestic—yet I knew nothing of the deity’s origins.

At that time, a village elder named Huang Heng, nearly eighty years of age, stepped forward and said: "The deity’s surname is Xu, a descendant of King Yan. In the second year of the Kaiyun reign of the Jin (945), he led troops into Min, passing through Jin’ao Peak where he stationed his forces to suppress bandits. Upon attaining immortality, his hidden and manifest powers brought life to the people. A local man, Fang Jue, first established a shrine on Zhiyu Island—now called the Ancestral Temple. Jue’s grandsons, Fang Xun, Fang Gan, and Fang Zhong, reported his deeds to the authorities. The matter reached the imperial court, and an edict was issued. Succeeding generations faithfully upheld their ancestors’ wishes, maintaining the sacrifices with reverence. In the seventh year of the Zhenghe reign of the Song (1117), the sacred flame was divided, and a site was chosen for the present Lingji Palace, where the shrine was built. Later, Fang Huan and Fang Wen led the villagers to expand the main hall and erect new gates. The deity’s numinous power grew daily, manifesting in the sacred dynasty. The temple was renovated, and the sacrificial rites were elevated, outshining all others.

Thereupon, they presented the *True Record of Master Xu*, which exhaustively documents the deity’s miraculous traces, along with the *Literary Works of Master Xu*, all written in the deity’s own hand. Within these texts are steles, biographies, postscripts, prefaces, petitions, eulogies, memorials, as well as the *Rhapsody on Jin’ao Peak* and *In Praise of the Mural Image*—each composition unique, their marvels ever unfolding. The elder then addressed me, saying: 'The deity’s divine manifestations are vivid in the people’s sight, and his hidden merits are fully recorded in these books. Though the books exist, they lack a preface. I humbly request a few words from you.' Unable to refuse, I replied: The deity lived in his era as a man of unparalleled brilliance. Devoted to the study of the Mysterious Dao, he and his kin ascended together to the immortal register, leaving their traces on Jin’ao Peak. The mountain’s vital qi converged in him, and his glory, honored with temple offerings, bestowed blessings upon the region. Why, then, was he long concealed? The fortunes of a land wax and wane, and the workings of destiny alternate between concealment and revelation. The deity foresaw the omens, and though his virtue briefly languished, he vented it through writing—his ethereal brush startling the world, its radiance dazzling the multitude. At times, his numinous power manifested, and prayers were answered as swiftly as an echo. As his cultivated deeds were transmitted and compiled, the records spread through the world, nurturing the vital qi of all beings for over four hundred years.

Now, under the sacred dynasty’s unification, virtue overflows between Hua and Yi. Moved by the deity’s spirit, the court bestowed the title of *Perfected Lord of Numinous Aid*, extolling his hidden virtue and greatly amplifying his divine might. He assists the state and shelters the people, repeatedly bestowing auspicious signs, revered throughout the Four Seas. Thus, his virtue is recorded, his honors grandly proclaimed. With spring and autumn sacrifices, his merits are inscribed on steles, enduring for eternity. At such a propitious juncture, the harmony between deity and humanity is no mere coincidence."

Thus, this preface is written.

Respectfully inscribed on the full moon of the mid-winter month in the year *jiachen* of the Yongle reign of the Great Ming (1424) by Ma Mian, Grand Master for Thorough Service, Left Administration Commissioner of the Fujian Branch of the Bureau of Transmission.

**Volume One of the *True Record of Master Xu***
**The Lineage of the Xu Immortals**

Xu Wen, styled Dunmei, was a native of Qushan in Haizhou. He had five sons: Xu Zhixun, Xu Zhijian, Xu Zhixun, Xu Zhizheng, and Xu Zhie. He also had an adopted son, Xu Zhigao. Initially serving under Yang Xingmi, Wen rose to the rank of Right Guard Commander through merit and began participating in military councils. In the sixth year of the Tianyou reign (909), the Lord of Wu appointed him Prefect of Shengzhou, where he commanded the naval forces at Jinling. In the twelfth year (915), he was promoted to Military Commissioner of Runzhou, Defender-in-Chief of the Zhenhai Army, and Grand Councilor. In the twelfth month of winter, he was enfeoffed as Duke of Qi and concurrently appointed Pacification Commissioner of the Two Zhe. Upon assuming his post in Runzhou, he designated Sheng, Run, Xuan, Chang, Huang, and Chi as the domains of the State of Qi, establishing the Grand Military Prefecture in Shengzhou. In the sixteenth year (919), he was appointed Grand Chancellor and Commander-in-Chief of All Military Affairs. In the fourth year of the Tongguang reign (926), he was posthumously honored as Grand Chancellor. Wen’s four generations of ancestors were enshrined in Jinling. He died in the second year of the Tiancheng reign (927), and the Lord of Wu posthumously conferred upon him the title of King of Qi, with the posthumous name *Zhongwu*. He is now revered as the *Perfected Lord of Loyalty and Brilliance, Supporter of the Qi King*.

Xu Zhigao, styled Zhenglun, later restored his surname to Li and changed his name to Li Sheng. A native of Xuzhou, he was orphaned young and drifted to Haozhou, where Yang Xingmi obtained him as a gift. Wen, a man of warmth and cunning, served as Wu’s Naval Commander, stationing troops in Jinling. Later, for his merits, he was appointed Prefect of Shengzhou. In the fifteenth year of the Tianyou reign (918), Wu appointed him Deputy Military Commissioner and Assistant Administrator, ordering him to resume his title as King of Haidong. In the sixteenth year (919), he was made Left Chief Minister, Participant in Government Affairs, and concurrently Commander of All Military Affairs. In the fourth year of the Tiancheng reign (929), the Lord of Wu appointed Zhigao Grand Councilor. In the second year of the Changxing reign (931), the Lord of Wu stationed Zhigao in Jinling, reappointing him as Military Commissioner of Zhenhai and Ningguo, where he governed Jinling and oversaw all court affairs. In the third year (932), he expanded Jinling’s walls. In the fourth year (933), he constructed palaces in Jinling. In the second year of the Qingtai reign (935), the Lord of Wu appointed Zhigao Grand Marshal, enfeoffed him as King of Qi, and accorded him exceptional rites. In the second year of the Tianfu reign (937), Zhigao established the State of Qi in Jinling. In autumn, Wu’s Crown Prince Lian married Zhigao’s daughter as his consort. Thereupon, he established the Imperial Ancestral Temple and the Altar of Soil and Grain, renaming Jinling as Jiangning Prefecture. In the eighth month of autumn, the Lord of Wu, Pu, presented the abdication decree to King of Qi Zhigao, who then restored his surname to Li, changed his name to Sheng, and honored Xu Wen as his adoptive ancestor. All of Xu’s sons were enfeoffed as kings, and his daughters as commandery and county ladies. He is now revered as the *Tang King of this palace*.

In the first year of the Qianzhen reign (927), Xu Zhixun was appointed by the Lord of Wu as Grand General Assisting the State and Prefect of Jinling, later promoted to Right Commander of the Armies and enfeoffed as Prince of Hong. Xu Zhijian was an adopted son of Xu Wen. While Li Zhigao served the state of Wu with utmost reverence, the other sons of the Xu clan could scarcely tolerate him. They often summoned him to drink, concealing swordsmen with intent to kill him. Zhijian revealed their plot to Zhigao, thus averting the crisis. Later, he was enfeoffed as Prince of E. Xu Zhixun, in the second year of the Tianyou reign (905), was sent by Xu Wen to assist the Lord of Wu in Guangling. The state of Wu appointed him Commander of the Capital Armies, and later enfeoffed him as Prince of Guangling. Xu Zhizheng, in the second year of the Tianfu reign (937), was enfeoffed as Prince of Jiang when Zhigao received the abdication of Wu. In the ninth year of the Tianfu reign (944), he accompanied the Prince of Rao in leading troops into Min, achieving merit at Jin’ao. Thereupon, a temple was established in his honor, and he is now revered as the Perfected Lord of Vast Grace of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace.

Xu Zhikua, in the nineteenth year of the Tianyou reign (922), was appointed by the Lord of Wu as Prefect of Jinling. Upon Zhigao’s receipt of the abdication, he was enfeoffed as Prince of Rao, and is now revered as the Perfected Lord of Vast Grace of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Palace.

The Five Marshals were generals stationed at the ancestral temple. The temple stele clearly records their enfeoffed titles. Among the marshals under the Perfected Lords—Yue Wenchang, Xu Wenji, Li Gu, Han Xizai, Zu Quan’en, Yan Keqiu, Ruan Qing, and Lu Qi—though their enfeoffed titles are unrecorded on the stele.

Zha Wenhui, in the eighth year of the Tianfu reign (943), was appointed by the Lord of Tang as Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs. In the ninth year (944), when Lian Chongyu assassinated his lord Wang Yanxi in Min, plunging the region into chaos, Tang dispatched Zha Wenhui under the command of the two princes to lead troops in attacking Jianzhou, stationing at Jianyang. Subsequently, the generals of Min all surrendered. In the eighth month of autumn, Wenhui seized the four prefectures of Jian, Ting, Zhang, and Quan by force of arms. He is now revered as Marshal Zha, the Eternal Guardian of Lingji Palace.

Bian Gao, in the eighth year of the Tianfu reign (943), was appointed by the Lord of Tang as Gentleman for Court Audiences and sent to crush the rebel Zhang Yuxian in Qianzhou, whom he captured and brought back. In the ninth year (944), Gao was appointed Prefect of Xinzhou. In autumn, when great turmoil erupted in Chu, Tang dispatched troops to attack, breaking through Tanzhou. Gao was then appointed Military Commissioner of Hunan, and is now revered as Marshal Bian, the Martial Guardian of Lingji Palace.

Wei Cen, in the ninth year of the Tianfu reign (944), was appointed by the Lord of Tang as Vice Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs. In the twelfth year (947), Cen was sent to pacify Zhang and Quan prefectures, later reassigned as Military Supervisor. He was subsequently appointed Gentleman Attendant to the Crown Prince, and is now revered as Marshal Wei, Left Supervisor of the Military Commission of Lingji Palace.

Zhao Zhong, styled Wende, was initially appointed by the Lord of Tang as Prefect of Chizhou, later recalled and entrusted with the governorship of Xuanzhou. He is now revered as Marshal Zhao, Right Supervisor of the Capital Armies of Lingji Palace.

Diao Yanneng, in the seventh year of the Tianfu reign (942), was appointed by the Lord of Tang as Pacification Commissioner, and is now revered as Marshal Diao, Vanguard Commander of the Capital Armies of Lingji Palace.

*Origins of the Temple’s Founding—Divine Decree and Hexagrams*

In the second year of the Qiandao reign of the Song (1166), Fang Xun, Fang Gan, and Fang Zhong reported these matters to the Prefect, who named it "Divine Response Protecting the Realm." In the third year of the Xining reign (1070), Lin Huaixian and others presented the case to Cheng Shimeng, Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, who memorialized the throne. In the eighth year (1075), Liu Yi and Zhou Ruli again submitted a detailed report. In the first year of the Shaoding reign (1228), Pacification Commissioner Xue Bi memorialized the court. In the first year of the Duanping reign (1234), Zhou Shuo of the Left Treasury and Zhou Sui, Prefect of Chaozhou, presented the matter to Executive Minister Li Zongmian, who memorialized the throne.

In the third year of the Duanping reign (1236), Emperor Lizong of the Song bestowed the following titles:
To the Golden Portal: "Perfected One of the Nine Heavens, Illuminating the Dao, Attaining Virtue, Great Immortal, Manifestly Numinous, Universally Beneficent" (Jiang, King of the River).

In the first year of the Jiaxi reign (1237), the temple was bestowed the name "Lingji Palace."

In the fourteenth year of the Yongle reign of the Great Ming (1416), Langzhong Wang Yu and Minister Fang Bin memorialized the throne regarding the deities’ merits. In the following year (1417), Emperor Taizong of the Ming bestowed further titles:

To the Golden Portal: "Perfected Lord of Vast Grace and Exalted Blessings."
To the Jade Portal: "Perfected Lord of Vast Grace and Descending Blessings."

*The Founding of the Ao Peak Shrine*
In the second year of the Kaiyun reign of the Jin (945), the Perfected Lords led their troops into Min, stationing forces to suppress bandits. The villagers established a shrine at Ao Peak. In the eighth year of the Taiping Xingguo reign of the Song (983), an ancestral temple was rebuilt, with the old site still extant—now the location before the Buddhist hall. By the Jiachen year of the Yongle reign of the Great Ming (1424), 479 years had passed.

*The Hong’en Lingji Ancestral Temple*
In the eighth year of the Taiping Xingguo reign of the Song (983), lay devotee Fang Jue first established the ancestral temple, constructing it of stone. All branch temples trace their origins here, with the Fang clan presiding over seasonal sacrifices. In the seventh year of the Zhizheng reign (1347), Fang Zhuangyou, Fang Fengwu, and Fang Sixi rebuilt it and erected an ancestral temple stele. In the third year of the Yongle reign (1405), Fang Wenzhao and others raised funds to rebuild it, altering its orientation to due north-south. By the Jiachen year of the Yongle reign of the Great Ming (1424), 442 years had passed.

*The Yanxi Community Altar*
In the first year of the Xiangfu reign of the Song (1008), a temple was established at Yanxi, receiving incense from the ancestral temple for worship. In the seventh year of the Zhenghe reign (1117), it was relocated to Hong’en Lingji Palace, and the original site was abandoned—now known as the Community Altar.

*The Hong’en Lingji Palace*
In the seventh year of the Zhenghe reign of the Song (1117), due to the abandonment of Yanxi, the palace was relocated to this site, oriented toward the northeast-southwest. Each year, the village elders led the people to pay homage at the ancestral temple, offering sacrifices of animals and wine to demonstrate their remembrance of origins. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng reign (1353), Shen Jianweng and others rebuilt it and erected a stele. Later, Fang Huan, Fang Wen, and others expanded the main hall and erected new gate structures.

In the eighth year of the Yongle reign of the Great Ming (1410), Fang Wenzhao and others raised funds to rebuild it. In the fifteenth year (1417), by imperial decree, eunuchs and local officials led military laborers to expand the foundation and reconstruct the palace, with an imperial inscription for the stele. By the Jiachen year of the Yongle reign (1424), 309 years had passed.

*The Qilong Immortal Shrine*
In the seventh year of the Xuanhe reign of the Song (1125), an altar was first established. Later, prayers for rain were answered, and a shrine was built, hence the name "Praying-for-Rain King." In the eleventh year of the Chunxi reign (1184), villager Guo Xisheng rebuilt it. In the first year of the Yuanzhen reign (1295), Zhang Feng and others renovated it.

By the Jiachen year of the Yongle reign of the Great Ming (1424), 300 years had passed.

**Origins of the Incense Flame**
The incense flame of Lingji spread throughout the region. In those days, with the flourishing of people and places, temples were established everywhere—such as the Jade Water and Clear River Osmanthus Palace, Yue Mountain and Jade Slope, Fu Mountain and Qilong, and the Stone Abode at the end of Xin’an River. To the west of Peng Mountain and Qingbu, from north to south as far as White Deer, encompassing the Cishi (Maitreya) Blessing Treasury of Heshan, the Dharma-Protecting *Kalyāṇa*-Spirits—though their halls and temples differed, their incense flames all traced back to the ancestral palace, for in truth they sprang from the same source: the Vast Grace True Lord.

The generals and marshals of each shrine varied, having been dispatched by the True Lord at the time of each temple’s founding.

**The Legend of Immortal Xu**
In the ancestral shrine of Lingji Palace, though the eastern and western corridors had fallen into ruin, the murals stood firm. In my youth, I often heard scholars say: these depict the deeds of the two Xu Immortals, whose temple offerings were established. The events are recorded in sequence, their truth preserved, and poems appended to praise their virtue.

From their early devotion to goodness and scripture-holding to their hidden merits in aiding others, from the founding of the Zhiyu Temple to the spreading of incense flames, each step followed in order. Entering this hall, one gazes upon centuries of bygone affairs as if they were present. Today, all who come cannot but revere and stand in awe.

As the years passed, the murals faded and dimmed, ever feared to be lost to oblivion. Thus, I have recorded them in full within this book, to be passed down for endless generations.

Moreover, in the reign of the Great Ming’s Yongle Emperor, their numinous efficacy and manifest responses shone forth—revering Heaven and diligently serving the people—to carry on their legacy. This, too, is the Immortals’ divine power, revived in the Yongle era.

Respectfully inscribed by Huang Heng, the Hermit of Linqiu, with bowed head.

**Devotion to Goodness and Cultivation of Conduct**
The Two Immortals were descendants of King Yan of Xu, sons of Xu Wen of the Southern Tang, and natives of Qushan in Haizhou. From youth, they cherished goodness and steadfastly pursued virtuous conduct. Whenever they encountered the poor and distressed, they gladly gave alms. In daily life, they disdained extravagance, valuing neither rare treasures nor frivolous amusements. Content with simplicity, they often ate plain meals at dawn. Thus, their merit and practice grew daily, leading them to ascend the Dao’s shore.

*Poem:*
Good causes and fruits are rare in the world,
Who knows the joy of cultivating the heart for the Dao?
The cinnabar fire burns the sky in a lovable place,
Their manifest blessings endure from ancient times to now.

**Holding Scriptures and Worshipping the Dipper**
At dawn, they ate plain meals and recited the *Jade Emperor Sutra*, sacred invocations, and the *Northern Dipper Longevity Sutra*. Esoteric rituals and secret texts were all thoroughly practiced. Each night, they fasted, bathed, and set up an incense altar. Only with their younger brother did they pray to Heaven and worship the Dipper, vowing to end warfare and pacify the people. Though state affairs were pressing, they never wavered in their resolve, ever diligently turning toward the Dao, their devotion deepening over time.

*Poem:*
Who knows their daily diligence in seeking the Dao?
Holding scriptures and worshipping the Dipper, they amassed merit.
When cultivation is complete and conduct perfected, they transcend the Three Realms,
Their names inscribed in the Immortals’ register for ten thousand ages.

**Enfeoffed as Kings to Pacify the Realm**
In the second year of Tianfu during the Later Jin’s abdication to the Tang (Dingyou, 757), the younger brother, Zhi Zheng, was enfeoffed as King of Jiang, and Zhi E as King of Rao. They were stationed in Jinling to soothe the displaced and defend over twenty prefectures. Taxes were lightened for the people, and provisions were ample for the troops. The barbarians of the forests and caves were subdued, holding fast to the essentials of governance and defense.

Young and old alike frolicked and played, hand in hand singing songs of joy—thus the people of Jiangnan all found peace and stability.

*Poem:*
Fragrant blossoms stand united in meritorious deeds,
Enfeoffed with lands and titles as kings they received.
The land at peace, the people prosperous, songs resound,
Guarding Jinling with loyalty, their devotion profound.

**Elders Welcoming the Master**
In the second year of Kaiyun during the Later Jin (Yisi, 945), internal strife erupted within the Min kingdom under King Wang. Warfare raged unchecked. Yu led Generals Zha, Bian, and ten thousand cavalry into Min, stationing troops south of the Xiajiang. As they passed through Qingbu, the village elders offered baskets of food and jars of drink, lining the road to welcome them. The people of both Xiang and Min found refuge, living undisturbed in their homes. Not a hair was harmed, and all were able to live in peace.

*Poem:*
Yu stationed his troops south of Xiajiang’s gorge,
Elders welcomed him with reverence, their safety restored.
No fowl nor hound was startled, all remained secure,
Without harm, officials and people rejoiced as one.

**Stationing Troops to Eliminate Bandits**
The elders, having welcomed the master, voiced their grievances to the king: "Recently, several hundred elite soldiers have concealed themselves atop Aofeng Peak, acting with arrogance and violence, on the verge of causing chaos. Now that Your Majesty’s forces have arrived among the villages, neighboring communities suffer deeply from their disturbances and cannot live in peace." Moved by their plight, the king led his troops southward, subdued the peak, and annihilated the ringleaders without battle. The people all returned to their homes in peace.

*Poem:*
Bandits atop Aofeng Peak struck fear profound,
Neighboring lands suffered, no peace could be found.
With a single deployment, the elite forces swept clean,
And ten thousand people resumed their livelihoods serene.

**Erecting a Shrine to Offer Longevity Prayers**
Once the bandits were pacified, the master returned. The elders, filled with admiration and reluctance to part, could not bear to let him go. They cut thatch to build a hut north of Aofeng’s Dragon Pool, where they enshrined his image, offering morning incense and evening lamps to pray for the king’s longevity. The king, his heart touched, swore to the people: "Next year, I shall depart this world and reside here." The site of that old shrine is now before the Buddhist abode.

*Poem:*
Grateful for boundless grace, their devotion ran deep,
North of Aofeng’s pool, a shrine they did keep.
There, they pledged to the villagers with solemn vow,
That one day, his spirit would dwell among them now.

**Appointed as Directors of the Celestial Waters**
The two kings lived in the world with unwavering devotion to cultivation. Their merits complete and conduct perfected, their Dao profound and virtue mysterious, their names ascended to the celestial courts and resounded in the Dipper’s palace. That year, they transcended in the constellation of Gouwu. Due to their lifelong worship of the Dipper, the brothers’ names were jointly inscribed as the two Directors of the Dipper’s Waters. They entered and exited the heavenly palaces, holding a green tally in the left hand and wielding a yellow axe in the right, standing in attendance before the Emperor to silently protect the people below.

*Poem:*
The Dipper’s palace guards its secrets well,
Yet immortals, through the Dao’s mysteries, their truths tell.
First as Directors of the Celestial Waters they rose,
Entering jade palaces, serving the Emperor’s repose.

**The Numinous Treasure Expounds the Scriptures**
Having attained the Dao, Youzhen journeyed to the Five Luminaries Palace to pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy. Kneeling, he addressed the deity: "By fortune from past lives, I have been blessed to be counted among the world’s beings. Gazing below at the Desire Realm, I see many commit evil deeds without shame or remorse, unaware of awakening. By what karmic conditions may they be saved? I beseech your compassion." The Heavenly Worthy then expounded the scriptural verses: "Those who cultivate themselves shall ever dwell in auspicious blessings."

*Poem:*
The Mystic Gate’s teachings from ancient times unfold,
Its sacred texts imparted, their truths untold.
Only these two immortals grasped the Dao’s profound way,
In the Five Luminaries Palace, scriptures they did sway.

**The Yellow Court’s Secret Teachings**
Though the kings were born into the mortal realm and enfeoffed with royal titles, they did not cling to the honor and glory of their rank. Instead, they delighted in the Dao, exhaustively studying the classics, dwelling in purity and embracing simplicity. Even after their merits were complete and their names inscribed in the immortals’ register, the Master of the Yellow Court, having long admired them, sought their secret teachings. During the Kaiyun era of the Later Jin, he visited the Yellow Court Daoist and received the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* on the secrets of longevity.

*Poem:*
What was the Yellow Court Daoist’s intent?
The secret of longevity the world could not prevent.
Having reached the abode where the perfected dwell,
Many scriptures and mysteries to them did swell.

**Paying Homage to the Buddha of Steadfast Light**
After the two kings returned to the Dao, they greatly propagated the secrets of emptiness and mystery, fully realizing their natural wonders. Above, they aided the Dipper’s immortals; below, they benefited all beings. Later, they paid homage to the Buddha of Steadfast Light, the Bodhisattva of Universal Compassion and Salvation, directly entering the realm of Suchness. Their minds aligned with the divine mechanism, their inner wisdom’s power flourished, further illuminating the principle of true emptiness and wondrous being—all was naturally attained.

*Poem:*
Before the ancient Buddha’s altar, in meditation deep,
True immortals bowed in reverence, the Chan gate to seek.
Mind realized, nature seen—emptiness within being,
Daoist and Buddhist truths, in essence, are one and the same.

**Talismans and Medicines to Aid the People**
In the second year of Xiande during the Later Zhou (Yimao, 955), the king began to issue talismanic judgments and prescribe medicines to aid the people. His fame spread in all directions, and his hidden merits lingered in the ears and eyes of the people. They revered and loved him as if he were their parents, relying on his protection. From then on, those who sought divine assistance or inquired of affairs found their prayers answered without fail. The sick were healed, and chronic illnesses vanished. His divine virtue grew ever more manifest, and the people’s hearts turned toward him in devotion.

*Poem:*
In Xiande’s reign, talismans spread far and wide,
With wondrous remedies, countless lives they did guide.
No plea went unanswered, his power truly divine,
The aged walked in health, the ill in peace did shine.

**Reversing the Wind to Extinguish Fire**
During the Xiande era, the villagers’ carelessness led to the disaster of Zaihuo. A single spark ignited, fanned by the wind into a raging blaze. Fierce and scorching, it consumed homes and dwellings. Towering beams and grand halls vanished in an instant, yet the flames continued to spread unchecked. The people, pale with fear, were at a loss, crying out to the two kings and begging for salvation. The kings then summoned a reverse wind with a single gust, extinguishing the flames entirely. The people all felt the depth of their virtue.

*Poem:*
A raging fire consumed the homes with might,
Grand halls and lofty beams vanished in its light.
With a divine gust, the wind reversed its course,
The people lived in peace, their livelihoods secure.

**Rescuing Boats at Cang Gorge**
The rivers and streams allowed for boat travel, with Min’s waterways being the most treacherous. The waters of Cang Gorge were especially perilous. Jagged rocks and towering cliffs lined the winding currents, causing many boats to be wrecked and stranded.

In the first year of the *Kaibao* reign of the Song, *wuchen* (8th year of the sexagenary cycle), a merchant vessel laden with goods nearly capsized. The boatmen cried out to the two kings, praying for protection. Suddenly, a faint yellow banner appeared amidst the clouds, and the boat sailed smoothly without peril.

*Poem:*
The Min’s waters, treacherous, bar the way,
Cang Gorge’s trials bring no small dismay.
Yet at their cries, a banner dimly shown,
The waves grew still, the currents gently flown.

**Dispelling Misfortune**
In the eighth year of the *Kaibao* reign, *dinghai* (24th year of the sexagenary cycle), during mid-spring, the seasonal *qi* was unbalanced. Villagers fell ill with pestilential sickness, entire households stricken in succession. Physicians’ treatments proved ineffective, and the affliction spread, some calling it the "toad miasma." The neighboring hamlets grew uneasy. They prayed at the shrine, where divine talismans and the wondrous remedies of the Celestial Physician were bestowed, bringing swift and miraculous cures. Thus were composed the *"Rhapsody on Dispelling Pestilence"* and the *"Incantation for Driving Away Toad Miasma."*

*Poem:*
The noxious vapors spread, unbearable their might,
Neighbors and lanes alike were filled with dread and fright.
By numinous power, the gales swept clean the air,
And peace was restored, the people’s health laid bare.

**Erecting a Shrine on Mushroom Isle**

In the eighth year of Xingguo of the Song (983), spring brought no rain. Prayers to the king were swiftly answered, and the villagers approached the shrine to seek divine response. Suddenly, a wooden incense burner emerged from the water’s heart, borne aloft by twin dragons. It flowed westward to Mushroom Isle, where it halted, spanning the stream without advancing. Paper money marked the boundary, and an extraordinary fragrance filled the air. That night, celestial lanterns appeared as an auspicious sign. The villager Fang Jue thus established the shrine there. Later, when sacred lingzhi mushrooms grew upon the isle, it was named *Zhiyu* (Mushroom Isle).

*Poem:*
A divine censer rose, encircled by twin dragons,
Borne westward to rest upon the isle.
Celestial lanterns shone through the night, all omens fulfilled—
Thus the villagers built the shrine’s hall.

**Hall of Harmonious Kinship**
The divine father’s name was Wen, who served as Prime Minister under the Wu. He passed in the *dinghai* year of Tiancheng (927) and was posthumously enfeoffed as Prince Qi, with the posthumous title *Zhongwu* (Loyal and Martial). His mother, Lady Tian, named Shu, was reverently honored as the Immortal Consort *Renshou Xianfei* (Benevolent and Longevous). When the two princes manifested their divine power and the shrine was established, the Hall of Harmonious Kinship was first erected to honor them. Arrayed within were King Tang, King Hong, King E, and King Guangling—all elder brothers of the deities. Dukes, marquises, grandsons, and sons—all were the immortal kin of the kings.

*Poem:*
The twin kings’ shrine stands, guarding southern Min,
A separate hall built to honor their parents.
In harmonious robes, as if still living,
Processions and dances in vibrant new garments.

**Establishing the Hall of Life-Registration**
The lady’s nature was gentle and yielding, her virtue akin to Earth. She diligently upheld the duties of a wife, her inner power aiding in hidden merits. Consort Xu of Prince Jiang, named Zhen, was enfeoffed as Lady of Jing State and honored as the Immortal Consort *Shunzhu Renhui Xianfei* (Compliant and Benevolent). Consort Tao of Prince Rao, named Huanyun, was enfeoffed as Lady of Wei State and honored as the Immortal Consort *Shanzhu Ciyi Xianfei* (Kindly and Auspicious). Together, they received the Daoist precepts of the Eastern Flowery Law Lord and were jointly entrusted with the affairs of the Bureau of Life-Prolongation and the Bureau of Life-Registration.

*Poem:*
Her inner power in governance shone most clearly,
In one transformation, her merits were fulfilled.

**Establishment of the Hall of Life-Registration**
The art of Life-Registration was once transmitted by the Eastern Flowery Lord, hence the hall was built and so named.

**Celestial Edicts of the Heavenly Emperor**
In the first year of *Zhidao* of the Song (995 CE), the villagers established the Yellow Register Assembly. Suddenly, celestial music resounded through the heavens, and auspicious clouds swirled about. The Heavenly Emperor dispatched divine messengers to bestow edicts, enfeoffing the Prince of Jiang as *True Man of the Golden Portal* and the Prince of Rao as *True Man of the Jade Portal*, each with a sixteen-character title. The consorts Tao and Xu were honored as *Immortal Consorts*, and their divine parents were likewise granted celestial enfeoffment. Thus, the hagiographies of the Two Perfected Ones were completed.

*Poem:*
The Yellow Register banquet opened as music filled the skies,
Divine messengers bestowed edicts, their grace profound.
The twin portals’ fame endures through endless ages,
A household of pearls and jade receives Heaven’s seal.

**Divine Soldiers Defend the Realm**
When the Min native Liu Yi was stationed in Guizhou, bandits besieged the border. Yi silently prayed to the Twin Portals, and the bandits indeed retreated. Later, when Han Shizhong fought at Dayi Garrison and Wu Zhen at Heshang Plain, divine soldiers were dispatched to shield the nation. They manifested the numinous power of Mount Gong’s grasses and trees, making the enemy see a million iron-clad cavalry in strict formation—so daunting that the foe fled without battle.

*Poem:*
His might displayed in Guizhou, repelling the southern tribes,
The gods’ efficacy shown in the mountain’s grasses and trees.
With iron cavalry arrayed in the valleys,
The bandits were swiftly pacified.

**Founding of Longshou Palace**
In the seventh year of *Zhenghe* of the Song (1117 CE), a site was divined at Dragon’s Head, and a temple was erected. In the *guisi* year of the Yuan (1293 CE), Shen Jianweng and others restored it, while Fang Huan and Fang Wen further erected gate tablets. In the *gengyin* year (1350 CE), funds were raised for reconstruction, though it remained unfinished. In the *dingyou* year of *Yongle* of the Ming (1417 CE), an imperial edict expanded the grounds, and the temple was rebuilt anew. The court appointed Fang Wenzhao as the sacrificial officer to oversee its worship.

*Poem:*
Fujian’s southern land, mighty beneath Ao Peak,
Here the Dragon’s Head Palace was chosen and built.
For the nation’s great merit, imperial favor runs deep,
Honored with a temple, its blessings endless.

**Auspicious Response to Prayers for Rain**
In the seventh year of *Xuanhe* of the Song (1125 CE), autumn brought no rain. The fields withered, and the harvest was imperiled. Farmers and villagers joined hands, praying at the temple. Suddenly, clouds and mist filled the sky, and a torrential downpour followed. From afar, on the southern mountain, a divine dragon flickered into view, bearing a yellow banner emblazoned with golden characters. The year yielded a bountiful harvest, and the people rejoiced in peace.

*Poem:*
Drought parched the land, the fields lay barren,
Crops withered, no water to be found.
At the temple’s prayer, dragon-mist arose,
The yellow banner gleamed, comforting the farmers.

**Eradicating Locusts**
In the second year of *Jiading* of the Song (1209 CE), during the fifth lunar month, the fields’ grain had tasseled but not yet ripened when locusts swarmed the land, wreaking havoc. The people were helpless. The village elders gathered at the temple, burning incense and offering solemn prayers with blood-stained sincerity. The Two Immortals summoned swift thunder, fierce rain, and violent winds, blowing the pests to the ground, where they perished.

*Poem:*
The western fields’ millet stood tall,
When locusts arose in grim despair.
Great winds and thunder brought torrential rain,
The pests fell dead, filling the furrows.

**Divine Soldiers Tame the Flood**
The villagers had long ago built a temple by Yan Brook, but it fell into ruin. In the fifth month of the *wuzǐ* year of *Shaoding* of the Song (1228 CE), heavy rains caused the brook to swell violently, drowning the crops. The people were terrified, but suddenly, a thousand laborers appeared, wielding baskets and spades. They dredged the source and diverted the flow, and the waters ceased to threaten the people. Soon after, the laborers vanished—revealed to be divine soldiers.

*Poem:*
Yan Brook’s floods surged, drowning the fields,
The people stood helpless, filled with dread.
Suddenly, a thousand men bore their tools,
Only then did they know the gods had come.

**Imperial Edicts and Honors**
The Two Immortals had earlier received the Heavenly Emperor’s favor and edicts of honor, their deeds renowned in their time, vivid in the people’s memory. Yet as temple steles crumbled, their story faded. In the third year of *Duanping* of the Song (1236 CE), the villagers petitioned the court, and an imperial edict was issued, bestowing the sixteen-character titles. The entire temple received imperial grace. In the first year of *Jiaxi* (1237 CE), the temple was honored with the golden-script edict plaque *Lingji Palace*.

*Poem:*
The Heavenly edicts came long ago,
Their divine traces later memorialized to the throne.
The golden-script plaque *Lingji* bestowed,
Their fame eternal, never to fade.

**Imperial Command to Welcome the Deities**

In the *Bingshen* year of *Yongle* of the Great Ming (1416 CE), Minister of War Fang Bin and Commander Lin Guan reported the deities’ merits to the court. A special command was issued, and Secretary Wang Yu was dispatched bearing the imperial decree to the temple, where he addressed the gods: “Born as nobles and enfeoffed as kings, you shed your mortal forms to ascend as immortals, receiving offerings in this land. Now we command the welcoming of your spirits—may you manifest your divine might.” The gods responded with resonant assent and graciously consented. Thereupon, they accompanied Zeng, Chen, and Sun to the capital.

*Poem:*
Throughout court and countryside, their numinous power was long renowned;
Noble ministers bore the decree to greet them with reverence.
May the gods’ brush grant their blessing in answer,
As crane-borne chariots soar to the imperial capital.

**The Two Immortals’ Audience at Court**
Once the imperial edict was issued, the gods’ efficacy had already been displayed at court. On the eleventh day of the third month of *Dingyou* in *Yongle* (1407 CE), the Two Immortals, leading the Five Marshals, appeared in the vermilion steps amid auspicious mists, manifesting their true forms. Their divine validation thus confirmed, reverence deepened, and from that time onward, incense and offerings flourished daily. The elder and younger brothers, their glory conjoined, and the entire temple’s retinue received grand honors, and so the rites of worship were renewed.

*Poem:*
Auspicious mists swirled as they revealed their true forms,
In this enlightened age, they came to court to meet the sovereign.
Long-ordained karmic convergence was no mere chance—
Their loyal service in aiding the state lay in revering the gods.

**Presenting the Divine Elixir**
That year, the emperor’s health faltered, and the gods, ever vigilant, never left his side. Silently, they activated their transformative power, greatly manifesting their divine favor: they bestowed sacred talismans and healed him with the wondrous medicines of Heaven’s physicians. With every word, efficacy followed; their response was as swift as an echo. His body was soon restored, and his chronic ailments, cast off, returned him to health. Moved by the gods’ turning of fate and the gift of rebirth,

*Poem:*
Sacred talismans and wondrous medicines from Heaven’s physicians,
Ever guarding the imperial person, never for a moment apart.
The gods’ power in curing illness is beyond repayment—
The grace of rebirth is known in this heart alone.

**Establishing a Temple in the Capital**
For their divine machinations in aiding the state, a traveling temple was built in Beijing as a dwelling for the gods. Eminent Daoists were assembled, and officials such as Zeng, Chen, and Sun were specially appointed to oversee the rites. To the west of the temple, the *Zhusheng Hall* was constructed to honor the *Xianfei* of Jing and Wei. At times, five-colored auspicious clouds and propitious mists appeared, and white cranes descended in spirals, their divine responses manifesting in omens.

*Poem:*
Grateful for the gods’ transformative power,
A traveling temple was built as their divine abode.
Auspicious signs and responses revealed their numinous favor—
Their fame, eternal as sun and moon.

**Imperial Decree of Ennoblement**
For their resplendent divine merit, the gods were ennobled:
The *Golden Portal of the Pure and Subtle, Cavernous and Mysterious, Lofty and Void, Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the State and Shelter of the People, Vast Grace True Lord*;
The *Jade Portal of the Lofty and Bright, Vast and Tranquil, Profound and Serene, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Kind, Aider of the State and Guardian of the People, Vast Grace True Lord*.
The gods’ father was ennobled as the *Yuliang True Lord*;
Their mother as the *Shushan Immortal Consort*;
The *Jingguo Zhenying Immortal Consort*;
The *Weiguo Gongjing Immortal Consort*.

*Poem:*
Long honored by jade seals, now glorified by imperial decree,
Again we witness the Ming court’s new bestowals.
The blessings of the ennobling edict endure forever—
Thirty-two characters, renowned through ages past and present.

**Filial Piety Moves the Gods**
Zhu Guanyinbao, a pearl-driller from Jiangning County in Yingtian Prefecture, had traveled to Beijing for work, longing for his parents. One day, he heard his mother had developed a boil behind her ear. Pierced with sorrow, he hastened to *Lingji Palace* and performed three thousand prostrations. The True Lord graciously manifested, descending talismans and medicines to heal her instantly. The court, praising his filial devotion, bestowed honors upon his household and recorded his story.

*Poem:*
Longing for his parents filled his dreams,
Hearing of her illness, he prayed to the True Lord.
Filial piety moved the gods to respond—
His household was honored, his tale inscribed.

**Establishing the Altar and Auspicious Responses**
On the fifteenth day of the second month of *Jihai* in the Great Ming (1419 CE), a fast was held. The court dispatched eunuch Zhang Da, Master of Rites, bearing the seal, and Daoist Master Zhang Yuqing to gather over seven thousand Daoists from Zhejiang, Huguang, Jiangxi, and Fujian. Within seven days, immortals manifested, vanishing without a trace. White cranes descended upon the altar, and multicolored clouds gathered in auspicious assembly.

*Poem:*
Upon the sacred peak’s hall, the altar was raised;
White cranes and auspicious clouds heralded the immortals’ descent.
The temple’s retinue received imperial favor, their devotion laid before the throne—
The Supreme Mystery deigned to listen, bestowing boundless grace.

**Imperial Composition: *The Biographies of the Two Perfected as Immortals***

Xu Zhizheng, descended from the lineage of King Yan, was a native of Southern Tang during the Five Dynasties period. Alongside his younger brother Zhie, both were peerlessly heroic and outstanding, embodying magnanimity and benevolence toward all things, loyalty to their lord, and filial piety to their parents. They revered the Three Treasures and shared a common devotion to goodness. Diligent in the pursuit of the supreme Dao, they performed fasts and offered jiao rituals, daily reciting the *True Scripture of the Jade Emperor* and the sacred invocations.

Both brothers served the state of Wu, with Zhizheng later enfeoffed as Prince of Jiang and Zhie as Prince of Rao, governing Jinling. Their military preparedness was thorough, and they comforted and resettled refugees, securing over ten prefectures. Taxes were lightened, and military provisions were abundant. The tribes of the forests and caves adhered to their governance, holding fast to the covenants. The young and old frolicked together, joining hands in song. No grievances arose from above, nor enmities from below. The people of Jiangnan all relied upon them for peace.

Later, when ordered to lead troops to attack Min, fearing the suffering of the innocent, they made a solemn vow: with each watch of the night, they faced north to pay homage to the Dipper, and their morning meals were always vegetarian, praying for the cessation of war. Wherever they went, they labored to comfort the people, and the prefectures surrendered at the mere rumor of their approach. Elders offered baskets of food and pitchers of drink, crowding the roads to welcome them.

At Xiajiang Gorge, several hundred deserters took refuge in the mountains and stirred rebellion. They promptly ordered the extermination of the ringleaders, and the remaining soldiers cast aside their armor, shouting and dancing in surrender. The people all dwelt in peace, and though the troops passed through fields and gardens, not a single vegetable or grain of rice was violated. The villagers then conferred among themselves, saying: "These are the parents who have given us new life." They erected a shrine to them on Aofeng Peak to offer sacrifices.

Before long, the brothers ascended as immortals in succession, becoming the Water Commissioners of the Dipper’s Central Bureau, coming and going from the Celestial Palace. Through accumulated deeds and merits, they silently protected the common folk, enabling all to fulfill loyalty and filial piety and to revere the Three Treasures. In times of drought, the people prayed at the shrine. Before the shrine lay a deep pool, its depths unfathomable. Suddenly, a divine serpent emerged, coiling upon the altar table, its color like cinnabar. Clouds rose from the pool’s surface, lingering all day without dispersing. The next morning, rain indeed fell, and the year saw a great harvest.

One day, torrential rains caused the Yanxi River to swell violently, submerging fields and crops. The people, panicked and at a loss, suddenly saw a thousand laborers competing with baskets and spades, dredging the source and diverting the flow, so that the waters no longer harmed the people. Soon after, they vanished without a trace—it was known then that these were divine soldiers.

The rocks of Cangxia Rapids were steep and treacherous; boats ascending or descending often lost control, and the boatmen cried out in prayer. Then, banners were faintly seen in the clouds, and the waters immediately calmed without incident. Whenever a household was careless with fire, or locusts damaged the crops, the people would appeal to them, and the wind would reverse to extinguish the flames, or the locusts would fly away of their own accord. They also crafted talismanic medicines to distribute among the people; all who suffered from illness and took them recovered immediately. Those who prayed for children took the medicine and soon bore descendants in abundance and prosperity. Thus, the people lived in peace, the land flourished, and the villages remained tranquil.

The people of Min, Liu Yi, governed Guizhou and Jiaozhi when barbarian rebels invaded the frontier, capturing Qin and Lian prefectures. Overwhelmed with dread, Liu Yi knew not what to do; he fasted, purified himself, and prayed, and the rebels indeed scattered and fled. Later, when Han Shizhong fought at Dayi Garrison and Wu Jie at Heshang Plain, both dispatched generals and soldiers to defend the realm, invoking the numinous power of the grasses and trees of Mount Bagong, so that the enemy troops saw from afar banners and standards fluttering, valleys filled with a million iron-clad cavalry, ranks arrayed in solemn order, the thunder of war drums shaking the plains. Before battle was joined, the foe had already fled in defeat. Their divine merits and wondrous manifestations are too numerous to recount in full.

One day, during the Yellow Register Fast, celestial music suddenly resounded in the sky, auspicious clouds swirled, and immortal officials led their retinue to the capital. Thereupon, moved by their devotion, the Heavenly Emperor dispatched divine messengers to confer investiture: Jiang Wang was enfeoffed as the Nine Heavens Golden Palace Illuminating Dao and Manifesting Virtue Great Immortal, Manifest Numinous and Universally Beneficent Perfected, charged with overseeing the Upper Clarity Celestial Astronomy Bureau, empowered to act at his discretion, and to correspond with the Wenchang Controller of Records and the Heavenly Mechanism Secretariat. His wife, Lady Xu of Jing State, was enfeoffed as the Compassionate and Benevolent Immortal Consort Assisting in Virtue, concurrently overseeing the Right Perfected Bureau of Great Unity’s Longevity.

Rao Wang was enfeoffed as the Nine Heavens Jade Palace Propagating Transformation and Upholding the Dao Supreme Immortal, Manifest Numinous and Vastly Beneficent Perfected, charged with overseeing all bureaus of the Lower Earthly Prison, empowered to act at his discretion, and concurrently serving as the Prime Minister of the Southern Culmen’s Life-Registering Bureau and the Secretary of the Thunder and Mystery Secretariat. His wife, Lady Tao of Wei State, was enfeoffed as the Kindly and Gracious Immortal Consort Assisting in Virtue, concurrently overseeing the Northern Yin Life-Registering Bureau of the Primordial Sovereign.

Their father was enfeoffed as the Illustrious and Bright Perfected, and their mother as the Virtuous and Kind Immortal Consort. Former titles were retained as before.

New temples were established in Min, and an auxiliary shrine was built in the capital to house the deities, with special edicts commanding officials to reverently maintain the sacrifices. As ministers whose merit extended to the altars of state and whose beneficence spread over the people, they were born as heroes and died as luminous spirits. Even a hundred generations hence, they continue to bless the living and secretly assist the imperial transformation.

Consider Zhi Zheng and Zhi E: scions of noble houses, they served their lord in a declining age, yet were able to pacify a troubled region and preserve its people. When they marched into Min, they entered with banners still, eradicated the rebels, delivered the people from the horrors of war, and restored them to the peace of their homes. Thus, the people’s hearts were moved with gratitude, and though they could not fully repay such kindness, they erected living shrines to honor them. After their ascension as immortals, they averted fires, warded off great calamities, spared the people from famine and pestilence, and granted them the joy of rest and renewal. Their merits complete and conduct perfected, they moved the heart of Heaven, which bestowed upon them the title of Perfected and ranked them among the immortals. Recently, through their subtle operation of transformative mechanisms, they greatly manifested numinous favor, curing Our illness. Therefore, We add honorific titles, renovate their temples, and reverently offer sacrifices in gratitude for their divine blessings.

All this arises from the accumulation of hidden merits, and thus their luminous glory endures, as eternal as Heaven and Earth—how could this be mere coincidence?

The poem says:
Serving parents with filial piety, serving the lord with loyalty,
Their fragrant blossoms intertwined—who could compare?
Further diligent in cultivating the true Dao,
They shared the fief’s soil and received the king’s enfeoffment.

Another:
In those years, they stationed troops toward Jinling,
The lands south of the river knew not war.
The army entered the seven Min regions, the people at peace,
How much blessing and grace bestowed upon the living!

Another:
In drought, the numinous pool stirred the coiled dragon,
Great rains poured forth, bringing a bountiful year.
The Huang Creek’s waters receded, the people free from harm,
The Cangxia Rapids’ boats passed through peril unscathed.

Another:
Locusts harmed not the crops, fires wrought no disaster,
Fields and wilds alike received abundant grace.
They bestowed divine talismans to multiply descendants,
And cured grave illnesses, restoring the stricken.

Another:
In Gui Prefecture, they manifested power to repel the barbarian foe,
Displaying wonders like those of Mount Bagong.
A million divine soldiers filled the valleys,
Dissolving the siege in an instant.

Another:
Divine talismans and wondrous medicines from celestial physicians,
Guarding Our humble self without moment’s departure.
The healing power of their divine merit is beyond repayment,
This heart knows the gratitude of rebirth.

Another:
Responding to prayers without delay,
Their transformative power partakes of Creation’s mechanism.
Riding qi and wind, they roam the eight directions,
Descending from celestial palaces to manifest numinous might.

Another:
Born a renowned general, they built great merit,
Their conduct perfected, they ascended as immortals—fortune has its cause.
In the capital’s Ao Peak, their temple receives eternal offerings,
Their cinnabar script titles attest to their celestial authenticity.

Another:
Their majestic numinous power shines ever brighter,
Protecting the state and pacifying the people, their merits grow ever more manifest.
Not only does their fame illuminate sun and moon,
But forever they endure with Earth and Heaven.

Imperially Composed Stele for the Hong’en Lingji Palace

We reflect that since ancient times, the worthy and wise have been born as eminent ministers, manifesting merit in sheltering the people, and after death, as luminous spirits, aiding the transformations of Heaven and Earth. Their influence surges and flows between the two realms, bestowing blessings upon the people, warding off disasters, and averting calamities. They revive the withered and quicken the dead, their numinous presence vast and boundless, as if ever above, ever beside—beyond the reach of human wit to fathom.

The poem says: “The spirit’s advent—how can it be measured? How could it be spurned?” This is what it means.

Consider the Nine Heavens Golden Palace Illuminating Dao and Manifesting Virtue Great Immortal, Manifest Numinous and Universally Beneficent Perfected, Jiang Wang, and the Nine Heavens Jade Palace Propagating Transformation and Upholding the Dao Supreme Immortal, Manifest Numinous and Vastly Beneficent Perfected, Rao Wang—their merit and virtue overflow, truly as described above.

The spirits were scions of the Southern Tang, born with meritorious service to the people and the state, their names recorded in the registers of the immortal ranks. The elder and younger brothers, equal in splendor, their blossoms joined in fragrance. They illuminate their offices in the heavens above and manifest their numinous presence upon the earth below, their breath and response swift as lightning and wind. The people below are enveloped in their care, relying upon them as parents—compassionate, benevolent, and loving, all things depend on them for peace.

Recently, when We fell ill, We tried every remedy, yet none proved effective. The spirits silently mobilized their divine essence, guarding and protecting Our person. In an instant, without delay, they responded to every invocation, repeatedly displaying clear signs and bestowing sacred talismans. With celestial physicians and wondrous medicines, they restored Us from peril to safety, from collapse to recovery, achieving the merit of reviving the dead. Their grace and favor are vast indeed.

We measure Our virtue as meager and shallow—how could We have merited such blessings? We shall forever cherish their power, how could it ever be forgotten? Deep as the sea, towering as the mountains—where is their limit? Since repaying merit is the enduring principle of the state, We now issue this proclamation, conferring upon them additional divine titles: the elder shall be called *Pure Subtlety, Cavernous Mystery, Tranquil Emptiness, Wondrous Response, Compassionate and Benevolent, Vastly Gracious Perfected*; the younger shall be called *Lofty Clarity, Vast Stillness, Tranquil Profundity, Wondrous Response, Benevolent and Gracious, Vastly Gracious Perfected*. Their former titles remain unchanged.

We have newly constructed grand temples, bright and spacious, befitting the spirits’ abode. We command the relevant officials to maintain reverent and pure incense fires, to offer seasonal sacrifices in spring and autumn, to replace their robes with the changing seasons, and to appoint five households for sweeping and cleaning. Thus do We express Our sincerity and gratitude, repaying the spirits’ vast blessings.

Though the spirits’ merit is profound, Our repayment is meager. Yet the spirits surely do not demand repayment—still, in Our heart, We cannot cease. The virtue of heaven and earth is life; the spirits embody the Dao of heaven and earth, assisting and illuminating the mechanisms of transformation. They emerge from darkness and enter obscurity, expanding and contracting in an instant, roaming the Great Clarity, overseeing the four directions, and benefiting all living beings. Their merit spans heaven and earth, so radiant that it cannot be fully described in words.

Thus do We make manifest their achievements, inscribing them upon unyielding stone, erecting them in their temples to be displayed for eternity. We append a poem:

Heaven bore heroic spirits, paragons of the age,
Moving through darkness and light as though in a single glance.
In life, their merit protected the land of Ou and Yue;
In death, as luminous spirits, their grandeur endures.
Vast as the sea, beneath flowering trees they rest,
Regulating rain and shine, cold and heat with perfect measure.
Winter knows no biting frost, summer no scorching heat,
Cool breezes dispel distant pestilence, no gales assail.
Lowlands yield abundant grain, high fields teem with millet,
Driving away misfortune, banishing demons and serpents.
Morning bells and evening drums gladden the young and old,
Atop towering Ao Peak, steep and majestic.
Winding and embracing, shaped by heaven’s design,
Spring orchids offer fragrance, autumn chrysanthemums bloom.
Cold springs and white stones, pure and pristine,
The spirits roam with feathered canopies.
Flying clouds, fluttering Dao banners and standards,
Swiftly they come and go, their numinous presence tireless.
Breath and response swift as verse,
Their boundless beneficence knows no end.
Four seasons bring offerings, rich libations,
Their protective power rivals none.
We vow to inscribe this in heart and bone,
Engraving their virtue upon enduring stone,
To display for ten thousand ages, radiant as sun and moon.

The fifteenth day of the fifth month, the fifteenth year of the Yongle reign.
*Filial Piety and Sincere Response Record*

Juror Zhu Guanyinbao of the First Ward, Zuan Pearl Craftsmen’s Quarter, Waxie Dam, Jiangning County, Ying Tian Prefecture, repeatedly dreamed from the eleventh month of the sixteenth year of the Yongle reign of his mother at home, now laughing, now speaking, filling Guanyinbao’s heart with longing. On the twenty-third day of the twelfth month, a familiar acquaintance, Zhang De’gang, arrived from Nanjing at Guanyinbao’s lodging and reported: “When I left, your mother was at home with a sore on the back of her head that had not yet healed.” Upon hearing this, Guanyinbao was stricken with grief and alarm, unable to compose himself. He immediately vowed before heaven to journey to the Hong’en Lingji Palace and perform three thousand prostrations—one thousand to repay heaven and earth, one thousand to repay the king, and one thousand to pray for talismanic medicine, beseeching the protection of his mother’s peace.

At dawn on the twenty-fifth day, he began his prostrations at the Hong’en Lingji Palace. Upon completing the first thousand, he lit three sticks of incense on his right arm and recited the Jade Emperor’s sacred name one hundred and eight times. As he neared the end, suddenly white clouds surged forth, filling the hall. A divine figure appeared, towering in stature, his face white as jade, his beard and whiskers resplendent. He wore a golden *ruyi* crown and a Daoist robe woven with gold, standing amidst the clouds and beckoning to Guanyinbao. Overcome with awe, Guanyinbao prostrated himself before the deity, who then bestowed upon him a sprig of dried cypress leaves and two yellow paper talismans inscribed with vermilion gourd symbols, saying: “Take these and brew a decoction for your mother.” Guanyinbao received them with reverence, and as he rose from his bow, the divine figure vanished without a trace. Cold sweat drenched his body, and he collapsed in a faint. Only with the aid of the palace’s Daoist attendants did he revive, whereupon he completed the remaining two thousand prostrations.

The following day, his vows fulfilled, the palace’s Daoist attendants escorted him to report the matter to the authorities. By order of the Ministry of Rites, he was granted five thousand strings of cash, ten *shi* of rice, exemption from corvée labor, and commendation for his filial piety, with a horse provided for his return to attend his mother.

We note that among the conduct of mortals, nothing surpasses loyalty and filial piety. When loyalty and filial devotion reach their utmost, they move the gods and spirits, as seen in the case of Zhu’s son. In his daily life, his thoughts were ever fixed on loyalty and filial piety. Upon hearing of his mother’s illness, his grief and urgency drove him to the Lingji Palace, where he extolled the sacred name and paid homage to the Perfected Lord. In that fleeting moment of reverie, he beheld the descent of the deity, who bestowed upon him talismanic medicine—how could this have been achieved without the power of his loyalty and filial devotion?

The nature of the divine lies in its responsiveness to breath and invocation, its transformations beyond measure. Moreover, the Perfected Lord, having attained the Dao and ascended as an immortal, enters the realm of gods and transcends the mundane, wielding the mechanisms of creation, protecting the state and sheltering the people. His monumental merits and boundless virtue shine resplendent between heaven and earth, and his responsive efficacy defies description. By imperial decree, he was granted a special honorific title, and a shrine was erected in his name, where seasonal sacrifices are offered—a ritual of veneration unmatched in ancient or modern times.

Through Zhu’s son’s prayer, the Perfected Lord’s divine response was made manifest, proving that even the sincerity of a common man or woman is sufficient to move heaven and earth, let alone the gods. Yet this is not merely a testament to Zhu’s son’s devotion; all who pray with utmost sincerity shall receive a response. If one’s heart lacks sincerity, not only will the gods remain unmoved, but retribution may follow. How can one not be cautious? How can one not be vigilant?

*Auspicious Omens*

When the Lingji Palace was first established in the capital, on the eleventh day of the first lunar month in the sixteenth year of the Yongle reign of the Great Ming (the year *wuxu*), five-colored auspicious radiance appeared upon the banner poles. On the twelfth day, five-colored auspicious radiance again manifested upon the banner poles. On the fourteenth day, as the Shangyuan Festival rites were conducted, three cranes circled before the palace, and five-colored auspicious radiance once more appeared upon the banner poles. On the fifteenth day, four cranes circled before the palace, and five-colored radiance manifested again.

On the seventeenth day of the fourth lunar month of the same year, during the sacred festival when an altar was erected for the offering of vegetarian repasts and prayers for longevity, four cranes circled before the palace from afar. On the ninth day of the first lunar month of the following year, the *Jinlu Baoyan Yanxi Luotian* Grand Offering was conducted. At the *chen* hour on the eleventh day, five-colored auspicious radiance appeared upon the main hall, the front hall, the three gates, the Lingxing Gate, the left and right banner poles, and the summit of the *hu* vessels. Auspicious clouds in the form of phoenixes gathered, and a jeweled canopy took shape. Azure and white auspicious radiance then manifested, sheltering the ritual altar, while a black crow alighted atop the right banner pole.

From the *wei* to the *shen* hours of the same day, five-colored felicitous clouds appeared above the main hall and the right banner pole, extending to shield the ritual altar. At the *chen* hour on the twelfth day, azure and white auspicious radiance manifested upon the banner poles and the jeweled canopy. At the *chen* hour on the thirteenth day, five-colored sacred radiance appeared upon the banner poles, the Lingxing Gate, and the summit of the *hu* vessels. Around the *wu* hour on the fourteenth day, azure, red, and yellow auspicious radiance manifested upon the banner poles, and five-colored felicitous clouds coalesced into the forms of dragons and phoenixes, encircling and protecting the ritual altar. At the *wei* hour, four cranes circled the altar from beyond the Heavenly Gate. Around the *shen* hour, azure, red, and yellow auspicious radiance appeared upon the banner poles and the jeweled canopy. Upon the left and right canopies, two small banners of royal hue naturally formed into longevity sashes.

At the *chen* hour on the fifteenth day, five-colored auspicious radiance manifested upon the left and right banner poles of the Lingxing Gate and the jeweled canopy atop the *hu* vessels. At the *si* hour, five-colored felicitous clouds sheltered the ritual altar. At the *wu* hour, cranes circled before the hall.

The Minister of War at the temporary court, Fang Bin, and the Commander of the Embroidered Uniform Guard, Lin Guan, respectfully memorialized the auspicious omens. On the ninth day of the first lunar month in the seventeenth year of the Yongle reign, by imperial command, the *Jinlu* Grand Vegetarian Rite was conducted at the Hong’en Lingji Palace. Since its commencement, the skies have been clear and the *qi* luminous, with five-colored auspicious radiance appearing for days on end. Auspicious clouds of resplendent hues, like soaring dragons and phoenixes, have enveloped the ritual altar. Cranes have arrived, black crows have descended, and upon the left and right banner poles and jeweled canopies, colored banners have naturally formed into longevity sashes. All these manifestations arise from the Emperor’s utmost filial piety and pure sincerity, which have moved heaven, earth, and the divine, bringing forth these auspicious signs in profusion—a true omen of the nation’s enduring prosperity for ten thousand myriad years and an inexhaustible blessing for all under heaven.

The Daoist officials and priests, with reverence, hereby report as follows:

The heart of man can move heaven and earth, stir spirits and gods, and penetrate metal and stone. Though heaven and earth are vast and difficult to move, though spirits and gods are subtle and difficult to stir, though metal and stone are hard and difficult to penetrate, that which can move, stir, and penetrate them is none other than utmost sincerity.

We revere the Perfected Lords of Vast Grace—
the Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gate, who embodies the luminous Dao and the penetrating virtue, whose numinous efficacy is universal and whose subtle wisdom is profound;
and the Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gate, who propagates transformation and upholds the teaching, whose numinous brilliance is vast and whose tranquil profundity is wondrous—
whose virtue and power are lofty and mysterious, resplendent above and below. They have amassed boundless merit, benefiting both the manifest and the hidden. Recently, they have vowed to spread goodness, crafting sacred talismans to relieve the suffering of all, regardless of rank or station, bestowing them without reserve. Yet their responsiveness depends on the sincerity—or lack thereof—of the supplicant.

If one approaches with reverence, purification, focus, and unwavering sincerity, the divine response will be swift, like an echo following a sound. But if one is negligent, insincere, or doubtful, not only will there be no resonance, but the gods will withhold their protection. Few who act thus shall attain peace and good fortune. Devout believers must therefore be ever vigilant, maintaining single-minded devotion, unflagging resolve, and unwavering reverence for the divine. Then, whatever they pray for shall surely receive a response.

Thus it is said: with sincerity, there are gods; without sincerity, there are no gods. How can one not be reverent? How can one not be cautious?

On the tenth day of the third month in the seventeenth year of the Yongle reign.

**Imperially Composed Preface to the *Scripture of the Wondrous Merit of the True Lords of Vast Grace and Numinous Aid, as Spoken by the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure***

I reflect upon the Dao as teaching: it reveals the profound mysteries of the primordial chaos and the void’s subtlety, embodying the wondrous spontaneity of the Boundless. Dim and obscure, silent and still—gazing, one sees not its form; listening, one hears not its sound. Above, it subtly upholds the imperial order; below, it benefits and succors all beings. Its virtue and power are so vast they defy description.

Among its manifestations are the Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace, Illuminator of the Dao and Perfector of Virtue, Revealer of Numinous Might, Universally Beneficent, Pure and Subtle, Cavernously Mysterious, Serenely Void, Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Kind, Protector of the Realm and Shelter of the People—the True Lord of Vast Grace, King Jiang; and the Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Palace, Propagator of Transformation and Upholder of the Teachings, Radiant in Numinous Might, Vastly Beneficent, Lofty and Luminous, Magnanimous and Tranquil, Serenely Profound, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Kind, Assistant to the Realm and Guardian of the People—the True Lord of Direct Grace, King Rao. Their spirits are refined and their excellence divinely endowed, their natures marked by magnanimity, kindness, and compassion. They cherish the people and love all creatures, are loyal to their lords and filial to their parents, and revere the Three Treasures.

Firm in resolve and devoted to goodness, single-minded in diligence and unwavering in purpose, their merits perfected and conduct fulfilled, they thus received celestial investiture, bestowed with illustrious titles, and ranked among the immortals. Assisting and illuminating the mechanisms of transformation, they emerge from darkness into light, warding off disasters and repelling calamities, dispelling misfortune to usher in auspiciousness. Spreading protection across the earth, they benefit and succor all living beings.

Of late, they have magnified their numinous blessings, safeguarding and shielding Our person, upholding and sheltering Us, thereby securing peace and tranquility. Thereafter, they manifested talismanic remedies, widely bestowing them upon the realm, with the aim of enabling people to purge illness and suffering and to flourish in progeny. Their great virtue and profound grace are equal to heaven and earth. Moved by the favor of the spirits, We have never forgotten, even for a moment.

Amidst the myriad affairs of state, We perused the *Marvelous Scripture of the True Lords of Vast Grace and Direct Grace, Spoken by the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy*, wherein the subtle and profound mysteries and unfathomable divine transformations are revealed. Offering expedient benefits and boundless deliverance, it is truly the sun and moon illuminating the dark, the boat and oar crossing the sea. Thus, We have had it carved and printed to widely disseminate it, in repayment of the spirits’ protection.

Virtuous and faithful devotees who purify themselves through repentance, revere the Three Treasures, fulfill loyalty and filial piety, practice benevolence and righteousness, and earnestly vow to receive, uphold, recite, and chant this scripture shall find their households blessed with fortune, their destinies smooth and prosperous, their descendants flourishing, disasters averted, calamities overcome, and blessings and longevity increased, extending even to their nine generations, all attaining transcendence and ascent.

Should any, however, slander or belittle, slight or disregard the Three Treasures, fail in loyalty or filial piety, lack benevolence or righteousness, and neglect reverent faith and devotion, they shall incur karmic retribution, their households decline and wither, their descendants grow weak and feeble, their lifespans cut short, and their nine generations burdened, forever sinking into the dark abyss. Looking back upon the past, clear evidence abounds.

Alas! Fortune and misfortune, good and evil—all are fashioned by the heart. To do good is to gain blessings; to do evil is to suffer calamity. Such is the natural principle. Thus it is said: "The family that accumulates goodness shall surely have abundant blessings. The family that accumulates evil shall surely have abundant misfortune." It is also said: "Only the August Heaven does not favor the constant; it bestows a hundred blessings upon those who do good and a hundred calamities upon those who do evil." Observing this, how can one fail to be exhorted? How can one fail to be exhorted?

On the first day of the first lunar month in the eighteenth year of the Yongle reign.

*The Marvelous Scripture of the True Lords of Vast Grace and Direct Grace, Spoken by the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy*

At that time, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy was in the Fivefold Luminosity Palace atop the Great Brahma Heaven, seated with a table before Him. Bells and chimes sounded of themselves as He convened the hosts of stellar deities and the great gods of the Five Dipper Stars to expound the Supreme, Boundless, Utmost True and Marvelous Dao.

Then the two envoys of the Dipper’s Central Water, one holding a green staff and the other wielding a yellow axe, stood in attendance before the Emperor. Bowing their heads in reverence, they knelt and addressed Him: "We, Your servants, were fortunate in past lives to encounter the heavenly and human realms. Gazing down upon the sentient beings of the Desire Realm, we see that they are neither loyal nor filial, neither righteous nor benevolent, committing many evil deeds without shame or remorse. The reckoning has reached its end, and this life is the final kalpa. The *Chou Kou Fu Tu* is in disarray, the moral order is fractured, warfare and conflagration rage unchecked, jade and stone alike are consumed in the flames. Some suffer from floods, others from famine. Punishments and taxes are oppressive, plagues and poisons spread. Afflicted by manifold sufferings, they know not how to awaken. The breath of life is nearly extinguished, and the human way is on the verge of collapse. By what karmic conditions may they be saved? We beseech Your compassion to open the gate of expedient means."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Excellent, excellent! The beings of the final kalpa are like newborn babes. If you are moved by this heart, all shall follow Our teachings. Widely expound the karmic conditions to all beings, enabling them to awaken their natures and cast aside doubt and hesitation. Loyalty and filial piety, benevolence and righteousness—cultivating these four shall ever dwell in fortune and blessings."

The envoys, having received this decree, dared not fail to comply. Thus, in the year of *jiachen* and the year of *bingwu*, they divided their forms to teach and transform, descending into the human realm. Their work accomplished in the Eastern Sea, their traces manifested in the Southern Regions. After a full cycle of sixty years, they returned to their duties. In one region, their incense fire endured for many years, until they encountered the time of extinction, yet they renewed their vows as before. Ascending the immortal ranks, they were bestowed the title of True Lords. By the Heavenly Worthy’s compassion and the Supreme’s virtue of cherishing life, all good men and women come to know that body, nature, and destiny all depend upon the Dao for their arising. Through loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness, they comprehend these causes.

On the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, the Three Assemblies, the Five Fasts, the *gengshen* and *jiazi* days, and one’s own life-day, they burn incense, observe purification, and make offerings according to the rites. With minds turned toward the north, they bow their heads in reverence and recite the names of the True Lords:

The Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace, Illuminator of the Dao and Attainer of Virtue, Great Transcendent Manifest in Numinous Might, Vastly Beneficent, Subtly Mysterious, Serenely Void, Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Kind, Protector of the Realm and Shelter of the People—#1 the True Lord of Vast Grace, King Jiang;

The Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Palace, Propagator of Transformation and Upholder of the Teachings, Radiant in Numinous Might, Vastly Beneficent, Lofty and Luminous, Magnanimous and Tranquil, Serenely Profound, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Kind, Assistant to the Realm and Guardian of the People—#2 the True Lord of Direct Grace, King Rao.

Reverently facing the sacred presence, they repent according to the scripture, never violating the True Lords’ vows, and establish themselves through loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness. Within, this may increase blessings and extend years; without, it may dispel disasters and overcome calamities. Above, it may enable the souls of ancestors to ascend; below, it may bring peace and prosperity to households. Universally, it is wished that all beings partake in benefit and joy.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy further expounded to the True Lords, speaking in verse:

The True Lords of Vast Grace,
Cultivated truth and attained the Dao.
Roaming and feasting in the immortal realms,
The Heavenly Worthy bestowed Their titles.
The Northern Dipper sent forth Their spirits,
Abundantly present at the left.
Below, They oversee the Three Realms;
Above, They pay homage to the Five Elders.
Blessing the realm and pacifying households,
Their merit is vast.
No prayer goes unanswered,
Silently responding to supplications.
Loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness—
Ever the treasures of the self.
Use them as karmic conditions,
Never violate the vows.
All good and evil
Are fashioned by the heart.
Those who do good gain blessings;
Those who do evil suffer calamity.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Heavenly Worthy’s ordinance and command!

Here ends *The Marvelous Scripture of the True Lords of Vast Grace and Direct Grace, Spoken by the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy*.

Imperially Composed Stele for the Temple of Vast Grace and Numinous Salvation

We have heard that the great virtue of Heaven and Earth is the giving of life. Within the ninefold expanse of their embrace, all living beings—great and small, high and low—are cherished by the heart of Heaven and Earth, which desires that each fulfill its nature, receive its nurture, and not lose its proper place. Moreover, sages, the wise, and heroes of outstanding talent arise to supplement the great work of creation. Thus, the extraordinary merits and mighty deeds of numinous spirits have been renowned through the ages. Those who govern the realm, embodying the heart of Heaven and praising the virtue of the spirits, include them in the sacrificial canon to offer prayers and repayments—this, too, has been recorded through the ages.

Our August Ancestor, the Emperor Taizong Wen, once dreamed of two divine beings who declared they dwelled in the southern seaside and had come to assist the state. The Emperor marveled at this. The following day, an official of rites reported the affairs of the Two Venerable Lords of Numinous Salvation in Min. This precisely matched the dream, so a special envoy was swiftly dispatched with incense to welcome the divine images to Beijing. There, west of the palace city, the Temple of Vast Grace and Numinous Salvation was established to honor them with sacrifices. Their former titles were augmented with illustrious appellations. Truly, the spirits are of utmost benevolence, responding to every prayer.

Theirs is the power to bestow blessings and avert calamities, swift as echo follows sound. What they have accorded with the imperial will is beyond full recounting. Seasonal offerings are made with solemnity and abundance. Our August Ancestor, Emperor Renzong Zhao, and our Imperial Father, Emperor Xuanzong Zhang, both upheld the established rites, honoring them with reverent sacrifices.

We, inheriting the celestial mandate and governing the great treasure of the realm, bear upon Our shoulders the profound grace of Our Sacred Ancestress the Grand Empress Dowager and Our Sacred Mother the Empress Dowager, and pray that their boundless fortune may endure for ten thousand years. Below, We contemplate the deep hopes of the myriad states and peoples under heaven, and pray that all may ascend to prosperity. Yet, mindful of Our own humble virtue, how could We alone be worthy of such resounding trust? Relying upon the will of Our ancestors, We have expanded and exalted the temple halls, reverently honoring the divine might, guiding and welcoming auspicious blessings. Thus, We augment the divine titles as follows:

**Nine Heavens Golden Portal Illuminating Dao and Manifesting Virtue Great Immortal, Radiantly Manifesting, Universally Salvific, Pure and Subtle, Penetrating Mystery, Serene and Void, Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the State and Shelter of the People, Exalter of Blessings, Vastly Gracious Perfected Lord.**

**Nine Heavens Jade Portal Propagating Transformation and Upholding the Dao Supreme Immortal, Illustriously Manifesting, Vastly Salvific, Lofty and Luminous, Vast and Tranquil, Serene and Profound, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Kind, Assistant of the State and Guardian of the People, Bestower of Abundant Blessings, Vastly Gracious Perfected Lord.**

The origins of these deities trace back to ancient roots. They descend from the lineage of Zhuanxu, enfeoffed in the state of Xu, and rendered repeated service to the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties. By the time of King Yan, their cultivation of benevolence and righteousness won the hearts of the people, ensuring the flourishing of their descendants. Through the Han and Tang dynasties, their merits and virtues were repeatedly recorded.

The two divine brothers were sons of the Loyal and Martial Emperor, the Yi Ancestor of the Southern Tang. The elder was enfeoffed as Prince of Jiang, the younger as Prince of Rao. Both were endowed with extraordinary nature, possessing the qualities of benevolence and sagacity, and fulfilling the virtues of loyalty and filial piety. They devoted themselves to the Great Dao, mastering its profound mysteries.

Initially, both were commanded to guard Jinling, where their achievements and virtues flourished, and the people were universally moved and delighted. Later, they were both commanded to lead troops into Min, where their utmost care for the people aligned with the will of heaven. The people cherished and revered them, flocking to them like rain. The people of Min built a shrine to them north of Golden Turtle Peak, where their images were venerated with the reverence due to a stern father.

One day, they addressed the multitude, saying: "Next year, We shall part from you, yet We cannot bear to leave you." When the time came, they departed this world in succession.

Not long after, the spirits descended to speak through mortals, declaring: "Together We have received the August Emperor’s command to assume office in the Dipper Palace, that We may protect the lands below." Thereupon, the people of Min redoubled their reverence in sacrifice, and every prayer met with response.

Beneath the shrine lay a deep pool. In times of drought, when supplicants prayed, a crimson serpent would emerge from the pool, and clouds would rise from its surface, followed by sweet rain pouring down in torrents, ensuring a bountiful harvest. When the Yan Brook swelled with torrential floods, the people, stricken with fear, turned their gaze to the shrine and pleaded for aid. Suddenly, a multitude of laborers appeared, wielding baskets and spades to dredge the waters. The floodwaters receded without causing harm, and the laborers vanished without a trace.

During the Xining era of the Song, when Liu Yi of Min governed Guizhou and repelled the Man bandits, when Han Shizhong fought at Dayi Town, and when Wu Jie battled at Heshang Plain, all achieved victory through the spirits’ assistance. Whether rescuing the people from fire and flood, prolonging their descendants’ lives, or performing extraordinary feats of efficacy, these deeds were all meticulously recorded, their brilliance resplendent and evident.

For the spirits had stored the essence of heaven and earth and received the finest of the Five Phases, thus in life possessing perfect virtue. In death, their luminous efficacy grasped the mechanisms of qi, aiding the mysterious transformations of the Dao, eradicating calamities and malevolent influences for the state and its people, and amassing abundant auspicious blessings. Their glory grew ever more resplendent with the passage of time.

Now, as We inscribe the completion of the shrine’s renovation, We also record the spirits’ lineage and their greatest virtues upon enduring stone, to be preserved for posterity. We append this poem:

Essence of the Two Modes,
Finest of the Five Stars.
Born as sages of wisdom,
Departed as radiant spirits.
Together they blazed in splendor,
Golden elder and jade younger.
Steadfast in filial piety and loyalty,
Their beneficence graced the age.
Riding the whirlwind and clouds,
They returned to the Emperor’s realm.
Their merit aided creation’s nurture,
Their rank equaled the Dipper’s balance.
Looking down in compassion upon the people,
Their gaze unceasing in care.
Averting disasters, warding off harm,
They congealed blessings and bestowed grace.
At Golden Turtle Peak,
The shrine first arose.
Their numinous transformations proclaimed,
A shrine was built in the capital.
August were the Three Saints,
Reverently served as one.
The glory of the spirits,
Bright as the sun’s radiance.
The heir ascends the great throne,
Faithfully upholding the eternal norms.
We refine the sacrificial rites,
To welcome blessings and fortune.
The prosperity of the imperial line,
Protects both family and state.
The flourishing of the supreme principle,
Extends to all people and things.
West of the palace city,
The numinous temple stands.
The imperial destiny and sacred rites,
Shall endure for ten thousand years.

**True Lords’ Incantation**
True Lords, True Lords,
Born of the Northern Dipper.

**Prayer for Clear Skies**
When timely rains fall,
Our millet grows.
Why then this excess,
Floodwaters rampant?
The people suffer in darkness,
Their grievances unvoiced.
Is it due to human failings unaddressed,
Or the misalignment of yin and yang?
We now make this great vow,
To universally deliver all sentient beings.
Sweep away the obscuring clouds,
Reveal the great brightness of sun and moon.
Let the damp become dry,
Let the rotten flourish anew.
May seasons follow their course,
And peace be proclaimed.
*Qian*, origin, prosperity, benefit, perseverance.
Hasten as the statutes of the Lingji True Lords command.

**Prayer for Rain**
Drought demons rage,
Stones melt in the heat.
Crops wither in distress,
Anxious and trembling.
No god is left uninvoked,
Yet none descend.
Only Our True Lords,
Ascend to touch heaven’s heart.
Enacting heaven’s transformations,
Their vows are profound.
Warding off disasters, averting harm,
Closing yang, releasing yin.
Divine dragons manifest,
Bringing three days of rain.
With the august title *Lingji*,
To this very day.
Hasten as the statutes of the Lingji True Lords command.

**Incantation to Ward Off Pests and Protect Crops**
Heaven gives birth to the people,
Who depend on food.
The people toil,
Laboring in fields.
Why, O Heaven, inflict this scourge?
Self-reproach and remorse,
Hearts tremble with dread.
Only Our True Ones,
Whose virtue is cherishing life.
The Emperor’s wrath may be turned,
Heaven’s heart may be moved.
Spirits of the fields, attend,
We implore your care.
Banish the borers and cutworms,
And all their kind.
Spare our fields,
Let us sow and reap.
This year shall yield abundance,
Rich in grain and millet.
True Lords, True Lords,
Manifest in majesty.
Since you do not forsake us,
Attend to our duties.
Recite this divine incantation,
Hasten as the statutes command.

**Proclamation of the Golden Palace**
The Star of Literature fell to earth,
More than thirty years have passed.

**Vacancies in the Immortal Bureaus**
The offices of the Immortal Courts lie empty,
Their officials unappointed.
The selections of the Many Heavens proceed,
Yet none are found worthy.
According to the Primordial Yang Jade Calendar,
This duty belongs to the Three Dynasties.
We must seek those who have accumulated goodness and built merit,
Whom the Three Realms commend,
Whom the Five Emperors protect,
Whose names are recorded in the heavens,
To fill these posts.

He is fit for the selection of Wenchang.
Heaven and humanity approve—
Do not persist in refusal.
In this ninth generation of the present age,
Whom but you shall we choose?
Our decree is just—
Go forth and strive with diligence.

You are hereby appointed as Chief Recorder of Wenchang,
With concurrent tenure of your former post.

**Proclamation of the Jade Palace**
The human form is hard to obtain,
Birth in the Central Land is rare.
We wish to unlock the mysteries of the Nine Heavens,
To succor the myriad people.
To propagate the Dao and spread its transformation,
To reverently uphold and enact it,
We must select Perfected Ones among the immortals
To fulfill this duty.

The Illustrious and Widespreadly Beneficent Perfected One of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Palace, Xu Zhie,
Has labored with earnest devotion,
Regarding the people as his children.
Long tested in external service,
His reputation and achievements are well-known.
Now, the Southern Dipper Bureau lacks its proper officer.

The office shall be filled by one capable, and in this, your ability is proven.
Let the aged find their proper end, the strong their proper use, the young their proper growth.
Let the widowed, orphaned, solitary, and childless all be provided for.
As for women with child—whether yet unborn or already delivered—let all be nurtured to life.
Let this be your mutual encouragement.

You are hereby specially appointed as Supreme Minister of the Southern Dipper’s Life-Recording Bureau, with concurrent tenure of your former post.

**Proclamation of the Jing Kingdom’s Immortal Consort**
The Immortal Consort of Benevolent Assistance and Kindness,
Extends benevolence to those below and embodies harmony in kindness.
With both virtues fully realized, this is the excellence of a noblewoman.
Thus, she aids the noble man without deviation or obstruction.
Her private concerns are set aside, her diligence unceasing day and night.
Within, she assists with compliance, as recorded in the rites.
A wife’s glory follows her husband’s honor.
She is hereby specially appointed as Immortal Consort, retaining her former name.

She is hereby specially appointed as Immortal Consort, retaining her former name.

Once he received the honor of posthumous titles; now, the fragrance of incense burns brightly.

In this tranquil peace, only by accumulating goodness and building merit can one unite hearts and assist in governance.

On the third day of the third month in the year of Yi-Wei, Dingguang Bodhisattva, together with the Emperor of the Sacred Peaks, memorialized to grant Jiang Wang the title of **Nine Heavens Golden Portal Illuminated Dao Attaining Virtue Great Immortal Manifesting Numinous Universally Beneficent Perfected One**, charged with overseeing the Celestial Astronomy Bureau and acting with full authority. His consort, Lady Xu, was bestowed the title of **Assisting Benevolent and Kind Immortal Consort**.

Rao Wang was granted the title of **Nine Heavens Jade Portal Proclaiming Transformation Upholding Dao Supreme Immortal Radiant Numinous Universally Beneficent Perfected One**, charged with overseeing all bureaus of the Lower Earthly Prisons and acting with full authority, concurrently holding the provisional offices of **Southern Culmen Life-Registering Grand Minister and Thunderbolt Dark Mystery Affairs Commissioner**. His consort, Lady Tao, was bestowed the title of **Kindly Assisting Virtuous Immortal Consort**.

Further conferred was the celestial secret text, which states:
*The Three Departments and Eight Sceneries—only essence, qi, and spirit.*
*In stillness, refine breath; turn from dust to unite with the Real.*
*Avoid defilement; guard this secret text.*
*Study it to attain the Dao and ascend as a Perfected One; recite it to prolong life and extend destiny.*

On the third day of the third month, this is the day of my descent. Prepare a clean basin of pure water and place it upon a spotless table. Should one first develop sores or swellings, take this water, add a pinch of salt, burn incense, and recite the Perfected One’s numinous incantation seven times before applying it to the afflicted area. Observe abstinence for three days, and recovery will follow.

Henceforth, on the Three Origins, Eight Festivals, Gengshen, Jiazi days, and the birthdays of Buddhist sages, slaughter for blessings is forbidden; I shall not accept such offerings. Now appointed as **Heavenly Court Rectifying Governance Supreme Immortal**, you must reverently believe and practice accordingly.

**Matters of Virtuous Practice:**
1. **Revere Heaven and Earth.** Heaven covers and Earth bears—such is the work of transformation and nurturance.
2. **Trust in the Three Treasures.** Honor the Three Treasures; never slander them.
3. **Keep distance from ghosts and spirits.** Respect but remain distant; evil shall not disturb the upright.
4. **Remember ancestors.** The merits of ancestors and virtues of clans run deep.
5. **Be filial to parents.** Parents’ toil is boundless; their kindness is unmatched.
6. **Love siblings.** Brotherly kindness and fraternal respect are the love of limbs.
7. **Uphold righteousness with one’s spouse.** The way of husband and wife begins and ends in righteousness.
8. **Observe propriety with neighbors.** The classics say: when stepping out, act as if meeting a distinguished guest.
9. **Teach descendants.** Goodness is innate; through teaching, they become true persons.
10. **Diligently study poetry and books.** The books of sages and worthies, when read, reveal principle.
11. **Labor in farming and sericulture.** Agriculture and women’s work sustain life; diligence ensures clothing and food.
12. **Show kindness to birds and beasts.** All live and grow; never harbor thoughts of killing.
13. **Cultivate hidden virtue.** What is hidden virtue? It is nothing other than convenience and kindness.

**Precepts of the Perfected Lords for Entering the Altar**

Upon entering the altar, each person shall take their place in order, preserve spirit and close the breath, knock the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and pace the void.

*The Supreme Ultimate divides high and deep,*
*Light and pure, it ascends to belong to Heaven.*
*If one cultivates the true Dao,*
*The body becomes a perfected immortal.*
*Deeds overflow the count of three thousand,*
*Time reaches forty thousand years.*
*The cinnabar terrace opens its treasure scrolls,*
*The golden mouth spreads its flowing transmission.*

**Prayer for Incense**
The censer burns with precious incense,
its smoke scattering through the jade heavens,
forming a cloud terrace,
adorned as the Dharma Realm.

Reverently, we burn the incense of the Dao, the incense of virtue, the incense of non-action, the pure incense of non-action, the naturally pure incense, the wondrous cavernous true incense, the numinous treasure bestowing incense, the incense transcending the Three Realms, and the true incense of the Three Luminaries. May it fill the jade halls of the Jasper Capital and pervade the Dharma Realm of the cosmos.

Today, we reverently burn this precious incense to offer in devotion to:

May each person’s worshipped deities, the united numinous powers of the Lingji Palace, and the entire assembly of sacred presences rely upon this true incense in universal offering.

This incense is the scattered radiance of jade blossoms,
the purple qi congealing into smoke,
a fragrant cloud woven densely,
directly filling the Nine Heavens.

May it be that the golden lads attend the incense,
the jade maidens transmit words and scatter flowers,
ascending to the presence of the true ones.
Whatever is petitioned and whatever is wished,
may all be granted as spoken.
*May it enter the mind.*

Today, as we open the altar and make this declaration, we humbly pray that the true compassion may deign to bestow its luminous regard.
We bow our heads and take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao.

**Chanting the Dao**
All in the Daoist ritual assembly,
each directs their mind to take refuge in the Two and the One,
reciting all the blossoming hymns of the Central Land.
*Three circumambulations.*

**Purifying the Altar**
The utmost true is only pure;
how can it descend to defiled realms?
When the dusty world is not yet cleansed,
how can the mysterious and primordial be manifested?
It is necessary to sprinkle the Dharma water from a single branch,
instantly dispelling the demonic miasma for ten thousand miles.
The nine phoenixes soar, spitting flames to break impurity.
The five dragons surge, descending true qi to expel evil.
May all who take refuge attain response in full.

The supreme and mysterious words of the Most High shall now be reverently recited.
*Within the cavernous void, the clouds...*

*The Heavenly Worthy Who Subdues Demons and Shields from Impurity paces the void:*
The five marshals proceed to the marshal’s presence to offer incense...

We humbly submit:
To transform on a grand scale is called sageliness.
That which is sagely yet unknowable is called spirit.

The Most Sagely abides in non-action,
naturally responding with emptiness.
Revering the spirits as if present,
all that is felt is wholly communicated.
Since what is held in mind is thus,
know that their mirroring is not far.

We humbly invoke the Five Great Marshals—Zha, Bian, Wei, Zhao, and Diao—
whose rank surpasses the five marshals,
whose valor leads the three armies.
They dance with shields and feathers between the two steps,
wielding the great axe of authority.
As generals they march forth, as ministers they return,
mastering both civil and martial arts.
They aid the state and pacify the people,
bearing the trust of ruler and subjects alike.
Majestic within the palace, solemn within the temple,
their fame resounds, their numinous power shines.
Too wondrous for words, they conceal their wrath.
All are extraordinary men of Yan and Zhao,
befriending one another like Lian and Lan.
In unity and harmony, they are trusted and employed.
They scale mountains and sail seas,
coming from a thousand miles away without hesitation.
They ride mists and soar through the void,
ascending directly to the heights of the Nine Heavens.

Today, as we perform this rite of requital and prayer for blessings,
the altar is purified, and the liturgy is about to commence.
We bow our heads in sincerity, wholeheartedly turning to the Dao.
To invite the true presence of the deities,
we must humbly reveal our innermost devotion,
relying on the Five Marshals to convey our plea.
We reverently beseech the Most High to descend,
greatly bestowing their compassionate vow.
May they grant our supplication,
and we offer our devout worship.

*All rise, each with reverence*
*Incense is offered*

With focused mind, the first offering of incense:
May the fragrance reach the Lingji Palace,
pervading the Lingji Palace,
where the sacred realm forms a canopy of clouds.
We offer to the Sacred Father, Prince Qi,
the Loyal and Martial Illustrious True Lord.

With focused mind, the second offering of incense:
May the fragrance reach the Lingji Palace,
pervading the Lingji Palace,
where the true realm forms a canopy of treasures.
We offer to the Great Immortal of the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens,
Manifesting Dao and Attaining Virtue,
Universally Revealing Numinous Aid,
Pure and Subtle Cavernous Void,
Mysteriously Responsive,
Compassionate and Benevolent,
Protecting the State and Sheltering the People,
Bestowing Blessings and Vast Grace,
True Lord Hong’en.

With focused mind, the third offering of incense:
May the fragrance reach the Lingji Palace,
pervading the Lingji Palace,
where the immortal realm forms a canopy of flowers.
We offer to the Supreme Immortal of the Jade Towers of the Nine Heavens,
Proclaiming Transformation and Upholding the Dao,
Illustrious and Universally Aiding,
Lofty and Profound,
Serene and Mysterious,
Wondrously Responsive,
Benevolent and Compassionate,
Assisting the State and Protecting the People,
Bestowing Blessings and Vast Grace,
True Lord Hong’en.

Kneeling before the censer:
The Dao is studied in the heart,
the heart transmits through incense.
Holding the jade censer,
the mind abides in the Nine Heavens.
May the True Lords deign to look down,
their immortal pendants approaching the hall.
Let our petition be conveyed,
directly reaching the Nine Heavens.

*All pay homage to the Perfected Ones, visualizing as prescribed*

**Five Stars Mantra**
The Five Stars array their radiance,
illuminating the five directions.
The Water Star averts disaster,
the Power of Wood brings prosperity.
Mars dispels misfortune,
Venus repels warfare.
Saturn guards the four quarters,
bringing benefit to family and state.
Inscribed on jade tablets,
recorded in the celestial chambers.
Riding the whirlwind and spreading light,
they soar through the great void.
Emerging from and entering the unseen,
they wander and feast in the ten directions.
Five-colored clouds form their canopy,
summoning spirits and commanding winds.
They employ the myriad numina,
harmonizing: "Above, protect the Immortal Elders."

*Twenty-four strikes of the Dharma drum resound*

**Opening the Censer**
The Most High Lord of the Five Numinous Ones summons forth
the Three and Five within our bodies,
the Merit Officers to left and right,
the Incense Officials and Envoys,
the Golden Lads who attend the incense,
the Jade Maidens who transmit words and scatter flowers,
the Daily Incense Officials,
the Merit Officer Envoys,
the Three Qi True Spirits—
hasten to ascend and convey this petition!

To the Five Great Marshals—Zha, Bian, Wei, Zhao, and Diao—
the Two Marshals of Yue and Xu,
the Heavenly Ding and Valiant Soldiers,
the Divine Officials to left and right:
We now ascend the altar for this Dharma rite,
reverently performing this requital and prayer for blessings.
All our sincere entreaties are set forth in the written petition.
Through this rite,
may we receive the vital qi of the true and authentic,
flowing into our bodies,
so that our words of supplication
swiftly reach the Most High Three Treasures,
the Heavenly Lords,
the Great Immortal of the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens,
Manifesting Dao and Attaining Virtue,
Universally Revealing Numinous Aid,
Pure and Subtle Cavernous Void,
Mysteriously Responsive,
Compassionate and Benevolent,
Protecting the State and Sheltering the People,
Bestowing Blessings and Vast Grace,
True Lord Hong’en,
and the Supreme Immortal of the Jade Towers of the Nine Heavens,
Proclaiming Transformation and Upholding the Dao,
Illustrious and Universally Aiding,
Lofty and Profound,
Serene and Mysterious,
Wondrously Responsive,
Benevolent and Compassionate,
Assisting the State and Protecting the People,
Bestowing Blessings and Vast Grace,
True Lord Hong’en.

Before the Sacred Ones, we bow once.

We, the undersigned [Name], together with the altar officials and assembly,
jointly and sincerely petition the Nine Heavens’ Golden Towers.
The sacred titles remain as above.

We humbly reflect:
Gou Long governs earth, pillars sustain valleys,
thus the altars of state and grain are established.
The Zhou revered scent, the Shang revered sound,
to commune with the power of the divine.
Not that blood sacrifices alone suffice,
for even humble offerings may be presented to kings and lords.
That which is sagely yet unknowable is called spirit.
That which is spirit yet can be named enters into sageliness.

We reverently invoke
the Great Immortal of the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens,
Manifesting Dao and Attaining Virtue,
Universally Revealing Numinous Aid,
Pure and Subtle Cavernous Void,
Mysteriously Responsive,
Compassionate and Benevolent,
Protecting the State and Sheltering the People,
Bestowing Blessings and Vast Grace,
True Lord Hong’en,
and the Supreme Immortal of the Jade Towers of the Nine Heavens,
Proclaiming Transformation and Upholding the Dao,
Illustrious and Universally Aiding,
Lofty and Profound,
Serene and Mysterious,
Wondrously Responsive,
Benevolent and Compassionate,
Assisting the State and Protecting the People,
Bestowing Blessings and Vast Grace,
True Lord Hong’en.

Uprightness is their virtue,
moving people with fortune and misfortune.
Hidden in earth, they are earth;
hidden in heaven, they are heaven—
their numinous power is unfathomable.
When they command the sun, it shines;
when they command the rain, it falls—
solely wielding the power of creation.
Their fame resounds, their presence overflows.
Above, they assist the Dipper Perfected at the North Pole,
silently participating in the mysterious learning of the Eastern Flower.
In union with the Dao, they guard the divine.
Their names are inscribed in the Golden Towers,
honored with titles of three or four characters.
Their offices shine in the treasure palace,
fitting the three thousand ranks of conduct.
Responding to circumstances, they vow to deliver people.
Having received the grace of their sheltering care,
how dare we neglect the rites of prayer and exorcism?

Reverently, as the divine carriage descends to the altar,
some wear immortal pendants, their steps measured,
eight phoenixes singing behind.
Some don court robes, their presence majestic,
a hundred riders welcoming before and after.
The immortal retinue arrays in splendor,
divine officials guarding left and right.
We welcome the True Ones with humble offerings,
their virtuous mirror perceiving our sincerity.
Unworthy as we are, we bow our heads again and again,
reverently inviting the divine presence.

**Inviting the Sacred Ones**
We respectfully invoke.

The Most Radiant and Dao-Attaining, Virtue-Manifesting Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal, whose boundless efficacy pervades the Pure Subtlety of the Cavernous Mystery, whose subtle responsiveness is vast and empty, whose compassion and kindness protect the state and shelter the people, whose abundant blessings bestow vast grace—Perfected Lord of Majestic Favor,

The Most Illustrious and Teaching-Spreading, Dao-Propagating Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal, whose luminous efficacy is far-reaching and all-embracing, whose lofty clarity and profound tranquility subtly respond with benevolence, whose aid to the state and protection of the people bring exalted blessings and vast grace—Perfected Lord of Majestic Favor.

The sacred ranks remain as before.
We humbly beseech Your True Compassion to descend upon this altar.
Having already received Your gracious descent in response to our invocation,
we now invite the immortal assembly to take their ordered seats in due rank.

The Jiao officiants reverently bow in devotion,
present incense,
offer the first libation of wine,
and scatter blossoms.

We, [Name], in shared sincerity, reverently address the sacred ranks as before.

We have heard that renown in benevolence and righteousness
traces its lineage to the scions of kings.
Unbending loyalty and martial valor
inherited the noble ranks of the State of Qi.
Benevolent fame first flourished in Min,
while virtuous repute spread far across land and sea.
Names were inscribed on bronze tripods,
and deeds recorded in historical annals.
Stationed south of the Gorges, the people remained undisturbed.
Raising banners on Aofeng, the remnants of bandits were eradicated.
Thus, the blessed land was secured,
and all equally enjoyed the gifts of a Yao-like reign.
How could one forget such grace, even to repay with withered grass?
The ode to the sweet pear tree still resounds.
In death, temples and sacrifices;
in life, enfeoffment—
this is the utmost honor.
Teaching the Dao to the people,
laboring to pacify the state—
to this day, these are praised.

Of old, even grasses and trees responded to the mountain’s numen.
Now, fields are spared the scourge of floods.
Boats striking rocks heard the cry of the Yellow Banner’s rescue.
Neighboring fires turned back with the wind,
forever sparing the threat of scorched chimneys.
In Jiading, locusts did not cross the border;
in Baoqing, drought demons wrought no disaster.
When the red serpent appeared, rain poured forth;
when the Nine Heavens’ divine dragon emerged, thunder roared.
For ten thousand li, no trace was seen—
yet how did the night reveal celestial lamps?
No sound was heard—
yet how did the day resound with strings and woodwinds?
Deeds endured for a thousand years, carved in stone;
enfeoffments through successive generations, inscribed in gold.
Thus, scholars and commoners journeyed from afar to pay homage,
and incense and offerings were reverently presented through all seasons.

Only virtue is upheld—
not merely the fragrance of millet and grain.
Only the proper kind is venerated—
especially the purity of sacrificial offerings.
Building merit and accumulating goodness,
holding precepts and practicing purification.
Had this not ascended to the heart of Heaven,
how could one have transcended to the ranks of immortals?

By imperial decree,
we revere the mysterious wind,
inscribing the names of the Golden and Jade Portals,
bestowing the titles of Great Immortal and Supreme Perfected.
The Dao is our Dao,
virtue is our virtue.
Transforming the teachings of gods and spirits,
the divine teachings do not merely glorify a single moment or a single person—
they illuminate what came before
and inspire what comes after.
Teaching harmony among kin,
the Hall of Joyful Feasting stands.
Above, we gaze upon the august majesty of the Sacred Father and Sacred Mother;
below, the Sacred Sons and Sacred Grandsons enjoy prosperity.
The Sacred Uncle’s name is recorded in the Purple Palace;
the Sacred Elder Brother receives temple sacrifices in Jinling.
The Divine Empress and Lady,
solely in charge of the Register of Births.
The Sacred Consort and Immortal [Title],
surrounded by the ranks of inner attendants.
Some oversee the Bureau of Blessings,
others hold the offices of ministers and nobles.
Authority surpasses the Five Marshals,
valor leads the Three Armies.
Whether martial or civil,
whether left or right.
The temple guards the land of the Seven Min—
its grandeur unmatched in virtue.
Its numen rivals the Five Peaks—
who but the Most Sacred could compare?
Merits towering, name enduring,
virtue extending to all beings.
By the shelter of the divine,
we are left in peace.
Every sip and bite—
dare we ever forget?
Thrice bathed, thrice perfumed—
we revere as if You were present.

Now, as we welcome Your precious carriage,
deign to regard this humble servant.
The diligence of the purification rites
has gathered the feathered ones;
we dare present the auspicious "Empty Song of the Azure Heavens."

We, your servants, bow a hundred times,
reverently wishing the present Emperor
ten thousand years of life as father and mother of the realm,
safeguarding descendants with security,
bestowing upon the sovereign a thousand blessings and a hundred fortunes.
May the imperial enterprise endure forever.

All memorial texts have been duly recited.
The memorial is now proclaimed.
As the text has been fully declaimed,
we humbly beseech the immortal compassion to deign to peruse it.

Averting calamities and warding off disasters,
the rites are especially solemn in the sacrificial canon.
Repaying merit and exalting virtue,
it is fitting to advance the immortal ranks.
May they be recommended for the vermilion records of the Golden Portal,
honored to attend the incense table of the Jade Emperor.
Inhaling and exhaling the Two Qi,
profoundly mastering the methods of emerging from the blue and entering the mysterious.
The Seven Fluids circulating,
attaining the subtleties of embracing the yellow and returning to the purple.
In oneself, the beauty of self-cultivation;
toward others, the merit of universal salvation.
All that is felt is surely communicated;
all that is sought is surely answered.
Relieving the people’s suffering—
what need is there for Bian Que’s prescriptions?
Divining the yin and yang of land—
silently imparting the learning of Guo Pu.
For those seeking marriage—
harmony in family and household.
For those desiring heirs—
the birth of sons and grandsons.
For those pursuing office—
exhorted to diligence and filial piety.
For those establishing themselves or engaging in trade—
taught that benevolence and righteousness are profit.
Farmers toil in the fields;
artisans refine their skills.
The distant are pleased and the near come forth,
treasuring benevolence and manifesting its use.
Turning their hearts toward the Dao,
all receive the grace of enlightenment.
From white-haired elders to children with hanging locks,
all rely on Your sheltering care.

Today, we conduct this rite of gratitude and prayer for blessings.
Again, we offer fragrant incense,
welcoming the descent of the True Ones.
Once more, we present the pure libation,
praying for the arrival of the divine carriage.

We humbly pray:
The Most Radiant and Dao-Attaining, Virtue-Manifesting Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal, whose boundless efficacy pervades the Pure Subtlety of the Cavernous Mystery, whose subtle responsiveness is vast and empty, whose compassion and kindness protect the state and shelter the people, whose abundant blessings bestow vast grace—Perfected Lord of Majestic Favor,

The Most Illustrious and Teaching-Spreading, Dao-Propagating Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal, whose luminous efficacy is far-reaching and all-embracing, whose lofty clarity and profound tranquility subtly respond with benevolence, whose aid to the state and protection of the people bring exalted blessings and vast grace—Perfected Lord of Majestic Favor.

May the Register of Blessings come,
bestowing boundless feasts for eternal enjoyment.
May the land of Hua-Xia be purified,
supporting the imperial enterprise forever.

Reverently bowing in devotion,
presenting incense,
offering the second libation of wine,
and scattering blossoms.

We, [Name], together with the altar officials and all present,
in shared sincerity, reverently address the sacred ranks as before.

We have heard that the Luo Pond Stele,
through all ages, cannot efface its heroic spirit.

The Thousand-Year Grotto of Eastern Florescence—who has inherited its true wind to this day? Solemnly we recall the earth-guarding deities, whose deeds have amassed boundless merit. Their skeletal forms merge with immortals in vast beneficence, their literary brilliance rivals that of Lord Liu. If not celestial essences stored in the stars, they must be the finest nurtured by mountains and rivers. Their poems, songs, and odes endure in recitation, demanding solemn inscription—inscribed once, inscribed again, inscribed repeatedly. Their words on fortune and misfortune, blessings and calamities, never err. Yet we dare not presume: first we invoke, then invoke again, and humbly beseech a third invocation. The principles of manifest and hidden are revealed with clarity; the mechanisms of rise and fall are foreseen. Their countenance is grave and majestic—feared like the biting frost and scorching sun. Their Dao is lofty and far-reaching—revered like the Northern Dipper and Mount Tai. Their virtue shines resplendently; their divine efficacy gleams sharply.

Today, we establish this ritual altar to requite kindness and pray for blessings. May we humbly beseech: the Three Luminaries remain balanced, cold and heat arrive in season; the Five Grains ripen, and the people flourish. May all things be free from pestilence, and the state abound in auspicious omens. All that is created and sustained shall return to the Great Dao.

Reverently bowing in devotion,
presenting incense,
offering the final libation of wine.
Scattering blossoms, chanting scriptures, and proclaiming the memorial.

Entering the Seven Governors’ Lamps to fulfill vows and offer profound gratitude.

We, [Name], together with the altar officials and all present,
once more kindle incense of renown,
universally offering reverence.
The sacred ranks as before.

We have heard that the towering peaks of Ao rise so high they may grasp the stars of heaven. The dragon’s head rears proudly, bestowing abundant rain and dew upon the mortal realm. Having long received their grace in ordinary days, how shall we repay them in this moment? Pure offerings are laid forth, though we are shamed by the lack of jade urns and golden nectar. The immortals’ fare consists of nothing but fiery jujubes and intertwined pears. Now the precious talismanic incense has burned low, the silver lamp’s flame grows cold. Star-crowned and feather-robed, the steps of the void resound far into the Jade Palace. Cloud chariots and mist-borne carriages, the procession prepares to return to the Golden Portal. Though our hearts race with longing, we earnestly pray for blessings ever more abundant.

Thus it is spoken.

Recite the Ten Contemplations:
First, body and mind grow pure and cool.
Second, the nature’s wisdom becomes perfectly luminous.
Third, the Dao is revered and virtue exalted.
Fourth, conduct is fulfilled and merit accomplished.
Fifth, the hun-soul and spirit become serene and upright.
Sixth, demon kings offer protection and welcome.
Seventh, celestial officials bestow blessings.
Eighth, the underworld erases one’s name.
Ninth, the dark paths do not approach.
Tenth, the Pure Land grants eternal life.

Replenish the incense burner.
May the Incense Officials and Envoys, the Divine Lords of the Left and Right, and the Attendant Spirit-Officials of the Incense,
cause this place of our ritual to naturally birth golden elixir, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms.
May the assembled hosts of a hundred spirits and perfected beings rejoice in this gathering before the incense burner.
May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions receive the rising incense smoke,
and swiftly convey the words we have just uttered,
directly to the *Perfected of the Utmost Non-Polar Great Dao, Radiant Dao and Penetrating Virtue, Great Immortal Manifesting Universal Salvation, Pure and Subtle Cavern-Mystery, Void and Wondrous Response, Compassionate and Benevolent Protector of the Nation and Shelter of the People, August Spirit of Vast Grace and Great Favor, Perfected Lord*;
and to the *Perfected of the Jade Towers of the Nine Heavens, Propagating Transformation and Upholding the Dao, Supreme Immortal of Illustrious Efficacy and Vast Salvation, Lofty and Profound, Vast and Tranquil, Subtle and Responsive, Benevolent and Kind, Assistant of the Nation and Protector of the People, Exalted Spirit of Abundant Blessings and Great Favor, Perfected Lord*.

Escort forth the *Holy Father, Loyal and Martial Supporter of the Luminous*.

Upon the completion of the ritual fast, we reverently bear the profound grace. With devoted hearts and bowed heads, we now send forth the *Perfected Lords of Vast Grace of the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens* and the *Perfected Lords of Vast Grace of the Jade Towers of the Nine Heavens*. The cloud-borne chariots do not tarry, nor can the crane-drawn carriages be detained. When future rites are held, we shall once more extend our invitation.

**Returning Chant**
The paired chariots return, borne on five-colored clouds,
Soaring high into the ninefold heavens.
Swiftly they vanish into the distant skies,
While the ritual site abounds with fragrant qi.
Profound grace suffuses the cosmos,
Blessings and fortune fill mountains and rivers.
Longing for the path of immortals,
Freely they ascend to the Great Loftiness.

Holy virtue endures in the ritual teachings,
The fast bestows long life and prosperity.
Life is prolonged by the jade tablets,
Petitions are presented in golden missives.
Sins are erased from the Northern Bureau,
Names are inscribed in the Southern Prosperity.
All the living enjoy extended years,
While the Perfected descend with auspicious blessings.

For the merits of the rites just performed, we pray the Perfected Lords bestow flowing grace and favor. Together, may all rely on virtuous deeds to ascend the Way, and may all devotees receive this offering.

**Dedication**
The Great Dao knows no bounds,
Like the radiance of good companions in the light.
The Perfect City responds to sincerity,
As echoes answer within the valley.
Now, for so-and-so, we humbly pray:
May the one who dwells in the northern palace’s splendor
Enjoy rivers clear and seas calm.
May their longevity match the steadfastness of the southern mountains,
With earth enduring and heaven eternal.
May civil and martial officials alike
See their ranks and emoluments increase.
May all within the palace gates
Rely on health and peace.
May the realm delight in the winds of great peace,
And all beings benefit from the power of nurturing virtue.

Relying on the assembly of the Dharma, we offer this for the highest good.

Recitation:
The Three Pure Ones and Three Realms Heavenly Worthies,
The Nine Heavens’ Blessing Heavenly Worthies,
The Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies,
Whose merits are beyond conception.

The Perfected Lords’ ritual is complete.
The Perfected Lords’ vows are fulfilled.

**Incense Offering**

Today, with reverence, we kindle precious incense,
devoutly offering it to the **Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace Illuminated Dao, Virtue-Attaining Great Immortal, Manifestly Numinous, Universally Salvific, Pure and Subtle, Vast and Void, Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the Realm, Shelter of the People, Exalted in Blessing, Vast in Grace Perfected Lord**;
to the **Nine Heavens’ Jade Palace Proclaiming Transformation, Upholding the Dao, Supreme Immortal, Radiantly Numinous, Vastly Salvific, Lofty and Bright, Vast and Serene, Profoundly Tranquil, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Kind, Assisting the Realm, Blessing the People, Abundant in Blessing, Vast in Grace Perfected Lord**;
and to the **Palace Immortals and all Divine Officials**, universally offered together.

We have heard that the manifest virtue of the gods
is called uprightness and called wisdom.
What mortals commonly desire
is ease and wealth, honor and nobility.
Sacrifice must bring blessing—
neither too spare in ritual nor too lavish.
For four hundred years, temple offerings have flourished,
incense fires burning ever bright.
Steles bear a thousand characters,
inscriptions to be heard and known.
Their luminous, undying names,
their awe-inspiring, life-like righteousness—
merits securing the altars of state,
virtues abiding in all living beings.
Farmers toil in the fields,
reaping the bounty of millet, rice, and grain.
Artisans hone their crafts,
meeting the standards of plumb, line, compass, and square.
Scholars establish themselves through loyalty and filial piety,
merchants profit through benevolence and righteousness.
Those who seek marriage
find harmony in home and household.
Those who pray for descendants
beget sons and grandsons.
Wind to the people, rain to the people—
all fulfill the wishes of growth and nurture.
Clothing for me, food for me—
all partake in the kindness of warmth and sustenance.
Bestowed upon the myriad things, all is fitting;
ordained through the four seasons, all is in order.
Gazing up to them is like beholding Mount Tai or the Northern Dipper—
their radiance is vast, never distant from us.
When they manifest, they appear as auspicious stars and felicitous clouds,
and all vie to behold them, counting it their joy.

We now offer grand rites to proclaim their numinosity.
Once they received the honor of imperial bestowal,
now they bear the favor of Heaven’s grace.
Their rank ascends to Golden Palace and Jade Palace,
their names advance to Great Immortal and Supreme Immortal.
Their honorific titles are exalted,
their majesty resplendent.
Their sacrifices endure for a hundred generations,
their standards guide the myriad spirits.
They stand as elders among the great creators,
ancient yet never aging.

We, though our hearts yearn for the Dao,
are unworthy in talent.
We humbly express our private gratitude,
offering this meager token of reverence.
With solemn assembly prepared,
we venture to disturb the gods’ wisdom.

We pray:
May jade phoenixes sing *jiu-jiu*,
may eight dragons coil in winding flight.
Lead the clouds and rainbows to descend,
command the gates of Heaven to swing wide.
First send Feng Jiang as vanguard,
then dispatch Fei Lian to follow in haste.
Bestow your grace with ease,
grant us the serene light of longevity.
Pour cassia wine and peppered ale,
steam orchid-wrapped delicacies on fragrant mats.
Roam freely, linger in leisure,
turn back in fond remembrance.

Our humble hearts are filled with earnest devotion,
awaiting your manifest presence.
All the Perfected Lords’ original vows and divine incantations,
we now diligently recite—
**Perfected Lords, Perfected Lords, Northern Dipper Great Spirits...**

The preceding divine incantations have been fully proclaimed.
We now reverently invite:
**Sacred Father, Loyal and Martial Duke of Qi, Illuminating and Upholding Perfected Lord**;
**Sacred Mother, Benevolent and Longevous, Kind and Virtuous Immortal Consort**;
the **Two Perfected Lords of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace and Jade Palace**;
the **Two Immortal Consorts of Jing and Wei Kingdoms**.
May their divine processions descend to join the assembly,
where the host of Perfected Ones array themselves in ranks to pay homage.

The homage complete, each ascends to their ritual seat.
With devotion, we bow and offer incense.

**Chanting Incense, Holding the Censer**
We humbly submit:
Bright virtue is offered, yet not through millet or grain can its fragrance be matched.
Those who walk the path of goodness
share their scent with orchids and angelica.
This incense—
jade censers emit auspiciousness,
golden tripods present omens.
Thick and billowing,
it coalesces into clouds and mist.
Warm and misty,
it nurtures the spring of the cosmos.
Holding it, messengers stand before us;
attending it, youths stand behind us.

If this is a ritual feast:
We bow our heads in reverence, devoutly offering.
If not:
The first libation of wine is presented.

With this, we accompany the sacred assembly,
directing our hearts in sincere offering.

**Incense Verse**
Cloud lotuses grow in Heaven,
strong winds scatter them across the four seas.
Deep within the dragon palace’s secrets,
sea gods present them to the immortals.
Today, with fervent devotion,
the fragrant smoke ascends to the purple court.
Penetrating and attaining the effortless,
all prayers are fulfilled as wished.

**Response:**
All together, with one heart, we offer.

**Scattering Flowers.**
The censer’s smoke rises in swirling eddies.
Circling the altar.

**Chanting Water, Holding the Water Vessel**

Prostrate, we reflect:
Even the sweat of toil may be offered to lords and nobles,
for loyalty and trust alone form its essence.
Yet the source-water flows ceaselessly day and night,
and we humbly confess our voices exceed our merit.

This water—
neither turbid nor dim—
remains ever clear, ever pure.
In Heaven, it becomes rain and dew,
caught by bronze pillars and golden stalks.
On Earth, it is sweet spring,
consumed like jade nectar and liquid jasper.
The wise act where nothing is lacking,
serving the highest good without contention.
No water fails to flow east—
its source arises here.

If this is a ritual feast:
We bow our heads in reverence, devoutly offering.
If not:
The second libation of wine is presented.
With this, we accompany the sacred assembly,
directing our hearts in sincere offering.

**Water Verse**
The silver river of Heaven overflows,
its limpid depths reflecting the ten directions.
Transformed, it descends as rain and dew,
bestowing boundless grace upon Heaven and Earth.
Moistening below, it revives the withered;
permeating, it nourishes all life.
Pouring this water, we express our red hearts—
body and mind wholly cleansed.

**Response:**
All together, with one heart, we offer.

**Scattering Flowers.**
Not from earthly veins, the flowing source—
scattering blossoms in the grove.
Irrigation from the celestial river.
*[Chanting continues.]*
Circling afar.

**Praise of Flowers / Offering of Flowers**
We bow in reverence, observing how layer upon layer of jade-green leaves
provide sheltering shade for the threads of purity.
How lush and fragrant the jasper blossoms,
born in the courtyard of the Great Possession.
These flowers—
their fragrance arises from □,
their hues know no fixed form.
The red lotus of the pond
suddenly shifts to emerald.
The white peony
may be dyed to gold.
From the Palace of Broad Cold, a single osmanthus branch—
its shadow cast upon the autumn moon.
Within the Wu-ling grotto, a thousand peach trees—
their dimpled smiles in the spring breeze.
To pour forth the devotion of sunflowers,
we humbly present the rites of duckweed and white milfoil.

If this is a ritual feast:
We bow our heads in reverence, devoutly offering.
If not:
The final libation of wine is presented.
With this, we accompany the sacred assembly,
directing our hearts in sincere offering.

**Flower Verse**
Rare blossoms flourish in the Dark Garden,
their roots spreading through the ten directions.
Standing tall for eight hundred years,
their fragrance descends to the dusty world.
Resplendent in the realm of radiant light,
scattering like jeweled flowers in the rain.
Gathering the purest essence,
we now offer them together.

**Response:**
All together, with one heart, we offer.

**Scattering Flowers.**
Where do the scattered flowers find their fragrance?

Circling in procession, we recite the *Scripture of the Perfected Lords*, having heard its teachings.
Thus we submit: when the spirit wanders in the Dao, sight perceives nothing, hearing discerns nothing.
When the spirit abides in the Dao, what was before the eyes suddenly appears behind.
Hidden yet never ceasing to be hidden—its name arises from a forced designation.

Since the dawn of the Crimson Clarity and the unfolding of heaven’s charts, the descent of celestial scriptures began.
When the Celestial Scribe wielded the brush, the flourishing of human culture arose.
The Emperor’s Renown bestowed it before the Terrace of Pastoral Virtue;
the Yellow Emperor transmitted it upon Mount Emei.
Some received it at Gourd Valley, fulfilling the vow of Helü’s sealed talismans.
Some descended upon Bell Mountain, accomplishing the merit of Great Yu.
How much more does the transmission of these scriptural teachings
awaken the understanding of all sentient beings?

This is solely by the grace of
**The Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal, Illuminator of the Dao and Attainer of Virtue, Great Immortal Manifesting Numinous Pervasive Salvation, Pure and Subtle Cavernous Mystery, Void and Wondrous Response, Compassionate and Benevolent Protector of the State and Shelterer of the People, Exalter of Blessings and Bestower of Vast Grace**,
and
**The Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal, Proclaimer of Transformation and Upholder of the Teachings, Supreme Immortal of Radiant Numinosity, Vast Salvation, Lofty Clarity, Vast Stillness, Profound Serenity, Wondrous Response, Benevolent and Merciful Assistant to the State and Guardian of the People, Bestower of Abundant Blessings and Vast Grace**,
who assist the Dipper Perfected at the Northern Culmen
and inwardly participate in the Mysteries of the Eastern Flower.
Through a hundred million kalpas, they cultivate without cease.
Fifty-five vows, each vow fulfilled in deliverance.
Refining gold into phoenix scripts, kneading jade to inscribe dragon chapters.
May all sentient beings together ascend the Supreme Dao.

The assembly of this Dao altar bows their heads in reverence, devoting their hearts to praise.
In unison, we chant the *Hymn of the Perfected Lords’ Original Vows*:

Ascending the imperial throne, advancing upon the celestial steps.
Radiance dependent on sun and moon, office encompassing the Three Terraces.
The ranked stars pay homage; the Han’s luminaries revolve in splendor.
The Dragon’s Horn in the east alone claims the Dipper’s head.
The Flowery Canopy and Chamber Steeds serve as strict and bright attendants.
The Feathered Forest Generals escort left and right.
The ocarina and reed-pipe play in alternation; the pitch-pipes harmonize in sound.
Returning in glory to the Celestial Palace, a journey of ten thousand leagues through the clouds.

**Response:**
The assembly of this Dao altar, each with utmost devotion, offers reverence according to the rites.

With devoted hearts, we prostrate and take refuge, honoring:

With devoted hearts, we prostrate and take refuge, honoring:
Within the Hall of Numinous Aid, in the Hall of Harmonious Kinship.

Nothing is more solemn than a father, and what matches Heaven must be known,
No repayment suffices for such kindness, yet there exists a way of reverent rule,
Moreover, in serving the king and fulfilling his mandate, she answers and extols the glory of civil and martial achievements,
Establishing the state and founding the household, she alone bears the trust of Yi and Zhou,
Her merits secure the altars of soil and grain, her blessings extend to descendants,
Most sacred, most numinous, most venerable, most solemn,
The Divine Father, Prince of Qi, Loyal and Martial Illustrious True Lord.

The *Book of Songs* and *Book of Rites* were earnestly taught in the hall where carp were leapt,
Her inner assistance in the household was most strict and bright.
Before the hall, she learned the play of the patterned robe,
Offering longevity blessings for a thousand springs, presenting the rhinoceros-horn cup.

Her yin rites cultivated, her teachings transforming, her fragrant name shining in the historical records,

Most sacred, most numinous, most compassionate, most loving,
The Divine Mother, Benevolent and Longevous, Kind and Good Immortal Consort.

The divine sons and divine grandsons, the ranks of dukes and marquises.

Dukes and marquises bear the lineage of dukes and marquises,
For hidden merits inherently reside in their descendants.
With devoted hearts, we prostrate and take refuge, honoring:

Forever serving as the auspicious omens of this blessed land,

Pearl-slippered and golden-haired, they fill the palace courtyards,
Their demeanor rich, their intentions profound, refined and true.
Gathering duckweed from the ponds, as befits the affairs of dukes and marquises,
Unlike the imperial consort’s chambers, famed as those of the Qin.
With devoted hearts, we prostrate and take refuge, honoring:
Within the Hall of Numinous Aid, in the Hall of Swallowing Joy,
The sun as their soul, the moon as their spirit,

Inspiring dreams through the Evening Star,
Mountains and rivers nurture brilliance,
Rejoicing in the descent of the sacred peaks,
Embracing the qilin from Heaven above,
Becoming the phoenixes of the human realm,
Most sacred, most numinous, responsive to every invocation.

The Divine Overseers of the Great Unity’s Birth Register,
The Divine Overseers of the Heavenly Unity’s Life-Bestowing Office,
The assembled ranks of consorts.
What joy in auspicious dreams—playing with jade scepters,
The auspicious qi of Mount Ao shines forth.
Children beget grandchildren, grandchildren beget children,
A hundred generations of the main branch flourish and prosper.
With devoted hearts, we prostrate and take refuge, honoring:
In the courtyard of the Dragon’s Head Temple, in the sacred realm of Mount Ao,
Their duties encompass the hundred officials,
Their ranks among the nine ministers,
The Controller of Emoluments wields the scales of Wenchang,
The Master of Blessings governs the life-bestowing authority,
Their teachings follow the *Hong Fan*:
"Long life, wealth, health, and peace."
Their praises resound in the ancestral temple,
Bringing prosperity, flourishing, and longevity,
Each person rejoices,
Everywhere receives grace,
Most sacred, most numinous, echoing like response to sound—the divine overseers of left and right blessings and emoluments.

The twin stars of Blessing and Emolument appear at the pivot of the Dipper,
Their duties lie in advancing the worthy through the imperial examinations.
Esteemed families, accumulating goodness, are called gentlemen,
Their children and grandchildren overflow with blessings.
With devoted hearts, we prostrate and take refuge, honoring:
In the courtyard of the Dragon’s Head Temple, in the sacred realm of Mount Ao,
Lightning flashes brilliantly,
Clouds rise high,
Heaven speaks not, yet its voice thunders in wrath,
The earth’s bounty relies on rain and dew to nurture life,
Divine mechanisms operate in the unfathomable,
Wondrous transformations turn in the formless,
Grace extends to the nine regions,
Blessings cover all living beings,
Most sacred, most numinous, ever-changing, ever-transforming—
Lord Thunder and Mother Lightning,
Earl Wind and Master Rain,
The luminous spirits of this palace,
The trustworthy Dragon Kings of Aid,
And the local earth deities of the five directions,
The rain-bringing dragon spirits, and all others.

Dragons ride the clouds, inherently numinous,
Their voices shake the thunder for ten thousand miles.
The world’s multitudes yearn for timely rain,
Suddenly their horns rise, towering and majestic.
With devoted hearts, we prostrate and take refuge, honoring:
In the sacred realm of Mount Ao, in the courtyard of the Dragon’s Head Temple,
Most sacred, most divine,
To the left, to the right,
Some present the arts of jesters,
Others excel in the skills of charioteers,
The stewards of the kitchen employ the eight delicacies,
The masters of music harmonize the six pitches,
The sixteen guards of the army are all generals in the making,
The three hundred cavalrymen each bear the marks of marquises,
Their might and numinosity resplendent,
Their images fierce and awe-inspiring,
Most sacred, most numinous, stern and protective,
The assembled ranks of the hall, the assembled ranks of the hall,
Mighty and numinous, mighty and numinous.

For their labors in stabilizing the state and benefiting the people,
Their incense and karmic ties are enshrined in the temple.
The fame of generals and ministers endures through the ages,
Their images praised for a thousand years like the qilin.
We kneel in reverence,
Sincerely repenting.
With devoted hearts, we surrender our bodies and take refuge,
Prostrating before the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Aid Perfected Lord,
And the assembled might and numinous immortals of the hall.

We humbly beseech the sacred compassion to bestow great blessings,
Showering vast grace,
As today, with solemn devotion,
We prostrate in repentance.
We have heard that misfortune and fortune have no fixed gate,
Only summoned by one’s own actions.
Good and ill omens appear,
Like shadows following form.
Goodness is the tally of evil,
Evil is the proof of goodness.
For those who do good,
The five phases support them,
The Controller of Fate befriends them.
For those who do evil,
Malevolent qi overwhelms them,
Evil stars shine upon them.
Though the Heavenly Net is inescapable,
It lies in the awakening of the human heart.
Today, we reflect upon all sentient beings,
Turning their hearts toward the Dao,
Sincerely invoking the divine,
Bowing in reverence to the truly wise.
First confessing our faults,
From past kalpas to this present life,
We have been ashamed of our transgressions, committing wrongs,
Turning from compliance to rebellion,
Altering our nature, clinging to obstinacy,
Employing deceit to exploit fissures,
Acting with dark cunning and perversity to carry out treachery,
Exercising cruelty and savagery to inflict harm.

Deluded by dreams and illusions, they wander lost in the pursuit of profit and fame.
Their wills are ensnared in the fields of killing, theft, deceit, and lust,
Sunk deep in the realms of greed, hatred, and delusion.
In great matters, they deceive Heaven and Earth;
In hidden ways, they betray the gods and spirits.
They curse the scorching heat and resent the cold,
Rebuke the wind and revile the rain.
At times, they relieve themselves beneath the stars,
Or expose themselves naked before the sun and moon.
They point at rainbows, swear oaths by mountains and seas,
Desecrate temples and shrines, defile sacred precincts.
Unmindful of the transgressions of body, heart, speech, and intent,
They disregard the proper roles of scholar, farmer, artisan, and merchant.
They neither honor the Three Treasures nor cultivate the Five Constants.
In serving others, they are disloyal;
In friendship, they are untrustworthy.
Toward parents, they are unfilial;
Toward lords, they are ungrateful.
The wealthy lack benevolence;
Those who hoard wealth lack righteousness.
They claim sacrifices are futile,
That violence causes no harm,
That reverence is not worth practicing,
That words are not to be feared.
They rebel against superiors and stir up chaos,
Flaunt their strength and resent poverty.
They slander and entrap the loyal and good,
Bully the orphaned and weak.
They suppress the public for private gain,
Exalt themselves while belittling others,
Incite lawsuits and sow enmity.
They mock and humiliate the innocent,
Act in ignorance of goodness,
And lack sincerity in themselves.
Minor transgressions may sever the bond between father and son,
Or dissolve the affection between brothers.
When the customs of the state decay, the lament of *Gufeng* arises;
When kin turn against one another, the song of *Jiaogong* is sung.
Now, recognizing the full measure of their sins,
They bow in reverence before the compassionate and repent in sorrow.
Who among men is without fault?
Yet if one errs and then reforms,
One should ever tremble with fear.
The gods do not accept offerings unconditionally,
But only those made with utmost sincerity.
With humble and earnest devotion,
They prostrate themselves, praying that the Most Benevolent may grant protection,
That the Great Dao may show mercy,
Forgiving past transgressions
And bestowing future blessings.
May all regions rejoice,
And all lands receive grace.
May this day bring great peace,
With no disasters arising, no calamities befalling,
And all things of fortune arriving in full.
May the old grow strong,
The young grow vigorous,
And the awe-inspiring virtue of the divine spirits be long revered,
So that their works may aid the people.
With utmost sincerity, we bow twice in worship and give thanks
To the Two True Lords of Lingji.
*Rise.*
Disciples, with one heart, bow in worship and give thanks
To the True Lord of Vast Grace of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal.
Disciples, with one heart, bow in worship and give thanks
To the True Lord of Vast Grace of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal.
Disciples, with one heart, bow in worship and give thanks
To the Sacred Father, True Lord of Loyalty and Martial Brilliance.
Having laid bare our earnest wishes, we humbly pray that the Sacred Compassion may deign to look upon us.

We offer ten prayers:
First, may the present Emperor’s longevity be as boundless as Heaven, harmonizing thus:
*May his years match Heaven’s, ten thousand springs in endless bliss.*

Eighth, may the incense fires ever flourish, harmonizing thus:
*May the temple’s majesty and divine power endure for a thousand years.*
Ninth, may the Nine Heavens bestow their mandate, harmonizing thus:
*May jade pendants chime as they approach the Purple Throne.*
Tenth, may all faithful and good beings in the ten directions, harmonizing thus:
*Return to the Three Treasures, each with utmost devotion.*

The rites of worship and hymns of praise are now complete.
All in the Daoist assembly, with reverence, once more address the spirits:
We have heard that with trembling caution, we dare not presume upon your patience,
Yet with awe and clarity, we behold your majestic presence before us.
With hearts inscribed by gratitude, we bow and raise our voices.
The virtues that shine forth are called manifest and luminous power;
Their merits may be extended to become universal and boundless salvation.
They serve as a bridge for the suffering,
A light for the lost in darkness.
Today, in this rite of gratitude and prayer for blessings,
We humbly stand before the True and Wise,
Proclaiming the wondrous teachings.
We offer the respect of triple ablutions and triple incense,
Yet cannot exhaust the reverence of even a single glance or bow.
The gods hear without partiality,
And our sincerity is plain before them.
May they cleanse the sins of past kalpas and this present life,
And let these acts become the causes of blessings in this life and the next.
With beginning and end complete,
Without evil or blemish,
What can be grasped, the foolish may yet attain;
What lies beyond, even the wise cannot fathom.
The gods transform, and the people are rightly guided.
When merit is fulfilled and deeds perfected,
One may ascend to the Jade Chamber and Cinnabar Terrace.
With qi preserved and spirit aligned,
One may open the brocade pouch of the Purple Yang.
May all faithful men and women attain long life,
And their ancestors of a hundred thousand generations all receive deliverance.
May even the departed in the hidden realms,
And all beings of every kind,
Return to the vast and boundless Great Vehicle.
For the supreme cause, we chant the invocation of the Heavenly Worthy.
The rites for the True Lords are now complete.

The Rite of the Seven Stars of the Celestial Balance is observed.
Today, we burn incense in offering to
The Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal, Illuminator of the Dao, Attainer of Virtue, Manifest Spirit of Universal Salvation, Pure and Subtle, Void and Wondrous, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the State and Shelter of the People, True Lord of Vast Grace and Exalted Blessings;
The Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal, Propagator of Transformation, Upholder of the Teachings, Radiant Spirit of Boundless Salvation, Lofty and Serene, Profound and Wondrous, Kind and Benevolent, Assistant to the State and Benefactor of the People, True Lord of Vast Grace and Abundant Blessings;
The Divine Immortals within the Palace,
And all the Spirit Officials—
We make offerings to all alike.

We reverently recall that when the Dragon Han unfolded the cosmic chart,
The primordial qi of the Mysterious and Original divided.
When the great turtle bore the transformations of all things,
The positions of Heaven, Earth, and Man were established.
For mankind, the Great Dao is hard to encounter,
And to be born in the Middle Land is rare.
Moreover, we are endowed with yang and yin,
Our four limbs formed.
We must value our bodies, preserve our lives,
And keep the myriad qi ever present.
Yet we fear old age, sickness, and death,
And each rejoices in growing tall and fair.
Man has desires, but Heaven shows no partiality.
Why are some granted wealth, while others suffer poverty?
Why do some live long like Pengzu, while others die young like Yanling?
The numbers of fate’s allotment—why not seek them within ourselves?

At that time, the True Lords of Lingji were roaming and feasting in the Jade Pure Sacred Realm,
In the radiant reign of the August Emperor,
Under the luminous gaze of Heaven.

Having established the great karmic conditions, they expounded the teachings for the multitude.
The five celestial bodies I govern—now waxing, now waning—are never constant.
The two luminaries I traverse—one summer, one winter—follow their ordered sequence.
To follow them brings the joy of auspicious prosperity; to oppose them brings the sorrow of perilous calamity.
Only utmost sincerity can move the spirits, and thus the accumulation of good deeds must yield abundant blessings.
Bathed in the radiance of their illumination, how dare we forget the debt of gratitude we owe?
On this day, the devoted Daoist so-and-so reverently opens the sacred altar and presents humble offerings.
Following the Jade Calendar of Primordial Yang, he burns incense and recites scriptures.
In accordance with the present statutes of the Numinous Treasure, he observes the fast and upholds the precepts.
He elucidates the sacred canons and kindles the divine lamps.
Gazing upward at the warp and weft of the celestial texts, he envisions afar the forms of the armillary sphere.
The orchid incense burns bright—its blaze is seen, its embers unseen.
The iron vessel holds its oil—its increase is seen, its decrease unseen.
Above, it illumines the thirty-two heavens, its brilliance vast and boundless.
Below, it enables the multitudes of hundreds and thousands to behold, revere, and take refuge.

All good arises from within the light, all evil perishes within the light.
Bowing once and bowing again, the heart’s eye becomes clear and bright.
From the first offering of incense to the third, the chanting voices ring clear.
Gazing upward, we trust in your all-seeing gaze; looking down, we beseech your radiant grace.
May the Three Realms descend as one, and ten thousand people come in reverence.
Malevolent stars retreat and withdraw—throughout the four seasons, no harm nor calamity shall arise.
Auspicious luminaries approach the hall, bestowing the Five Blessings: fortune and longevity.
We bow our heads in homage, taking refuge in the ever-radiant Perfected Wondrous Dao and Virtue, the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Illumination.

The assembly, with sincere devotion, takes refuge and pledges faith to the Sacred Palace of Lingji:
The Heavenly Golden Portal’s Illuminated Dao and Attained Virtue Great Immortal, Manifestly Revealed and Universally Salvific, Pure Subtle Cavernous Mystery, Void and Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Benevolent Protector of the Nation and Shelter of the People, Exalted Blessing and Vast Grace Perfected Lord;
The Heavenly Jade Portal’s Proclaimed Transformation and Upholding Teaching Supreme Immortal, Illustrious and Vastly Salvific, Lofty and Illuminated, Vast and Serene, Void and Profound, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Compassionate Assistant to the Nation and Protector of the People, Abundant Blessing and Vast Grace Perfected Lord;
The immortals within the palace, and all the numinous officials.

We reverently kindle the Seven Luminaries’ Divine Lamps of the Armillary Sphere, arranging above the image of the sun’s radiant yang.
We humbly recall: the Dao resides in the beginning of the Great Ultimate—unseen in its boundlessness, unmanifest in its subtlety.
The sun is the essence of all yang, fulfilling every aspiration and illuminating every hidden realm.
Its mystery is unfathomable, its presence divine.
Resplendent is its numinous power—men revere it as they did Zhao Dun.
Brilliant and ever-present above, the people gaze upon it as they did the Duke of Zhou.
Its virtue shines with radiance, vast indeed.
Its purity gleams like jade, bright and clear.
The crow-wheel is solemnly prepared, circling the palace of entangled ritual.
The chariot of Xi is majestically adorned, offering homage in the Hall of Cavernous Yang.
It emits a thousand-yard radiance, universally illuminating the three-thousandfold world.
Entering our gate, it dispels the doubt of the homeless.
Following our Dao, it eradicates the ailments of the forsaken path.

We reflect upon all sentient beings, lost in the dust and drowned in obscurity, vainly exhausting themselves in pursuit of shadows.
Like hail and dew, their splendor is fleeting—only the lament of passing moments remains.
From this day forth, may they turn inward and reflect, abiding in the Dao’s constant illumination.

We pray that those who trade in the marketplace may gain the wealth of merchants and shopkeepers.
Those who labor in the fields may find peace in plowing and well-digging.
The skilled artisan may measure shadows with the jade tablet.
The diligent craftsman may burn the midnight oil.
The scholar may compose verses in five-colored splendor.
The official may earn the title of the Eight Learned Scholars.
In the twilight of their years, may they vie with the pine and cypress in evergreen vitality.
May the glow of the firefly’s light increase, and may they share in the blessings bestowed upon all creatures.

With hearts as devoted as the sunflower’s turning, we beseech the bestowal of your radiant light.
The assembly now reverently follows the incantation of the Sun Sovereign as spoken by the Most High, bowing in homage and chanting with devotion.

With sincere hearts, we take refuge and pledge faith:
To the Heavenly Golden Portal’s Illuminated Dao and Attained Virtue Great Immortal, Manifestly Revealed and Universally Salvific, Pure Subtle Cavernous Mystery, Void and Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Benevolent Protector of the Nation and Shelter of the People, Exalted Blessing and Vast Grace Perfected Lord.
To the Heavenly Jade Portal’s Proclaimed Transformation and Upholding Teaching Supreme Immortal, Illustrious and Vastly Salvific, Lofty and Illuminated, Vast and Serene, Void and Profound, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Compassionate Assistant to the Nation and Protector of the People, Abundant Blessing and Vast Grace Perfected Lord.

Forming the noon mudra, we inhale the noon qi.
From afar, we envision the Perfected Lord of the Cavernous Yang’s Resplendent Palace as if present.
Gazing eastward toward the Fusang Palace, we bow in homage to the Resplendent One.
O radiant light of the Cavernous Sun, vast and boundless—what thoughts arise?
Grant me the golden hue, awaiting the celestial vision of your majestic form.
The imperial blossoms and jade maidens descend to the hall at this very hour.

*Response:* May this lamp’s light be directed toward the Perfected Lord.
Scatter flowers.
The Heavenly Worthy of Great Illumination and Perfect Extremity.

The assembly, with sincere devotion, takes refuge and pledges faith to the Sacred Palace of Lingji:
The Heavenly Golden Portal’s Illuminated Dao and Attained Virtue Great Immortal, Manifestly Revealed and Universally Salvific, Pure Subtle Cavernous Mystery, Void and Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Benevolent Protector of the Nation and Shelter of the People, Exalted Blessing and Vast Grace Perfected Lord;
The Heavenly Jade Portal’s Proclaimed Transformation and Upholding Teaching Supreme Immortal, Illustrious and Vastly Salvific, Lofty and Illuminated, Vast and Serene, Void and Profound, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Compassionate Assistant to the Nation and Protector of the People, Abundant Blessing and Vast Grace Perfected Lord;
The immortals within the palace, and all the numinous officials.

We reverently kindle the Seven Luminaries’ Divine Lamps of the Armillary Sphere, arranging above the image of the moon’s radiant yin.
We humbly recall: the primordial qi resides within the vastness of the Great Void—colorless and formless.
The moon’s essence descends with the splendor of blossoms, imbued with nature and sentiment.
Passing through the Winnowing Basket, it stirs the wind; departing from the Net, it brings forth rain.
Such is the work of Heaven.
Manifesting its numinous power through illumination.

With eighty-three thousand gates to the Toad Palace, its pure radiance may be drawn near. Gazing upon the Crane Terrace of fifteen hundred years, its sacred presence lingers still. When Liu Yuanshi broke the barbarian siege, his aspiration to ascend the tower was indeed fulfilled. When Cao Mengde forged his hegemony, what hindered him from strumming the zither and singing? Some, refining their essence, received the Han’s tally; others, yielding their luminance, answered Wu’s auspice. Their names resound with clarity, their deeds shine with distinction.

We humbly pray that all beings—those who steal light in fleeting shadows, or nurture obscurity within dust-laden concealment; those who conceal flaws while magnifying strengths, or who, masking faults with embellishment, incur the sin of dim confusion—may now offer forthright repentance and, by fortune, behold this luminous grace.

May the swans gather in the marsh without fear of ravenous flight, and within the realm where the cock crows, may the ox’s labored breath never be heard. Those who pound the hare’s elixir may attain long life; those who harvest the oyster’s pearl may gain wealth. Those who enter office may soon be chosen by the Moon Goddess; those betrothed may indeed await the Old Man’s word. When the Jade Light appears, may fine sons be conceived; when the jade adze is wielded, may craftsmanship reach perfection. Bowing in reverence to the Weaver Maid while marking the sundial, we shame ourselves before Venus’s raised cup.

The assembly of ritualists, in accordance with the *Divine Incantation of the Great Yin Sovereign Lord* as spoken by the Most High, prostrate in devotion and chant with sincere reverence:

*With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and pay homage to the Lofty and Illuminated, Vast and Serene, Void and Profound, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Compassionate Assistant to the Nation and Protector of the People, Abundant Blessing and Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens.*

*With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and pay homage to the Lofty and Illuminated, Vast and Serene, Void and Profound, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Compassionate Assistant to the Nation and Protector of the People, Abundant Blessing and Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Jade Towers of the Nine Heavens.*

Forming the mudra of the incantation, inhaling the unmanifest qi, we visualize the Perfected Lord of the Palace of Primal Yin’s Radiant Convergence as if present. Gazing upward to survey the eight directions, we see only the moon, pregnant with yin essence. Within it dwells the Primordial Sovereign, her lady attendants driving green carriages. Their splendor illumines the Two Poles, their blended radiance shines upon the Three Clarities. Earnestly seeking the supreme Dao, the Five Colors descend in welcome.

*Response:* May this lamp’s light be directed toward the Perfected Lord.
*Scatter flowers.*
*Perfect Mirror Illuminating Heaven Honored One.*

With wholehearted devotion, the assembly of ritualists takes refuge in the Numinous Aid Palace, the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens, the Jade Towers of the Nine Heavens, the immortals within the palace, and all the numinous officials. We reverently kindle the Seven Luminaries’ Divine Lamps of the Armillary Sphere, arranging above the image of the Wood Virtue’s Year Star of the East.

We humbly recall: the heart of the Dao is one, profound and silent, beyond naming. The spirit of Wood is benevolence, its wondrous work the ceaseless generation of life. In time, it is spring, and the spring wind nurtures all; in virtue, it is the origin, and the primordial qi quickens the embryo. All equally receive its fostering power, yet still rely upon its pruning force. As the high mountain commands reverence, so too does this truth hold everywhere. Xie An, obtaining it, revealed the numinous power of Mount Gong; the Duke of Zhou, obtaining it, dispelled the slander of golden mounds. When Shuo was employed to harmonize the plum, dreams came from the wilds; when the mulberry was gathered and the corpse appeared, the spirit descended at Xin. Their achievements stood unmatched in their time, their names fragrant through ten thousand generations.

We humbly reflect upon all beings—those who, like the tree-stump watcher, cling to their lot, or who, like the parasitic vine, overreach their station. Though their timber be coarse and unadorned, like the oak or the uncarved block, yet if their nature is straight as the catalpa or the willow, their cups and trays may still serve. When guided by the marking-line, they are made straight; without the carpenter’s square, they cannot be formed.

We pray that those who hold office may carve their patterns with simplicity and elegance; that those who hear lawsuits may govern with the grace of the sweet pear. Observing the way of the catalpa and the catalpa-son, may fathers be kind and sons filial; singing the poem of the flowering calyx, may elder brothers be friendly and younger brothers respectful. May those who wish for sons become sagely younger brothers, sprouting the five-branched osmanthus; may those who form friendships become ageless companions, standing tall as the thousand-year pine. May the peach blossom with its radiance bring harmony to house and home; may the autumn fruit be offered in reverence to ancestors and forebears. Though we present the humble gift of dates, it is not to imitate the grand rite of burning offerings.

Let the assembly of ritual practitioners reverently follow the divine incantation of the Star Lord of Wood Virtue as spoken by the Most High, bowing their heads in homage and reciting with devout sincerity:

With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and pay homage
To the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens.
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and pay homage
To the Jade Towers of the Nine Heavens.

The incantation gathers the script of yín and hài, drawing the qi of yín and hài.
Envision the Perfected Lords of the Azure Flower Azure Heaven as though present.
The Year Star rides the virtue of Wood, revolving to illuminate the eastern quarter.
Its celestial form is moist and radiant, five hues blending in luminous splendor.
Seeking blossoms, they sing in vast waves; casting water, they chant in the chambers of mushrooms.
Through seasons of frequent prayers and supplications, blessings naturally grow everlasting.

Response: May this lamp’s light be turned toward the Perfected Lords.
Scatter flowers.
The Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Wisdom and Perfect Illumination.

With wholehearted devotion, the assembly of ritual practitioners prostrate themselves before the efficacious powers of the Lingji Palace—
The Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens,
The Jade Towers of the Nine Heavens,
The immortals within the palace, and all divine officials.

Reverently kindling the Seven Luminaries Lamp of the Jade Balance, we array the image of the Fire Virtue Sparkling Deluder Star in the southern quarter.
We humbly recall that Fire holds the virtue of the southern quarter, where the Flame Emperor wields authority.
The deity governs as Lord of the Eastern Sea, and the Perfected Lord is granted his title.
His spirit is forged from jade essence, his form refined from golden elixir.
He studies the scriptures beyond the mundane, his goodness like a reflection in light.
Responding to circumstances, he transforms; vowing to deliver all beings,
He lifts those mired in suffering and places them upon his sleeping mat.
Moved by the scorched and parched multitudes, he turns their cries into songs of joy.
In laboring to stabilize the realm, the sunbird manifests auspicious signs.
In warding off calamities and repelling disasters, the Fire God reverses the winds.
His voice heralds radiant splendor, his majestic power blazes mightily.

We reflect upon all sentient beings: their desires remain unquenched, their study of the Dao unclear.
In their pursuit of power, they cannot avoid flattery to curry favor.
In their schemes, how dare they not resort to treachery and spread poison?
Trying to stop boiling by stirring the pot—is this not folly?
Gathering embers after the fire—is it not too late?
Fortunately, the warning to "bend the chimney and move the firewood" still stands;
Yet like snow touched to a red-hot furnace, the moment of awakening arrives.
Anxiety is like smoke—who can grasp heat?
Once a prairie fire spreads, can it be extinguished?
How can one allow jade to burn with it?

We humbly pray: may our weapons be stilled, the alarms of wolf-smoke forever silenced.
May the people’s suffering be relieved—what need is there for the labor of moxibustion?
May those who cook and drink find nourishment for life;
May those who gather firewood and tend stoves each secure their livelihood.

Heaven observes the singular virtue, thus it is said: "Sincerity leads to enlightenment, and enlightenment to sincerity."
By doing good, a hundred blessings descend, enabling you to flourish and thrive, thriving ever more.
A single stick of heart-incense may reach the azure heavens;
Three beams of divine light illuminate the sacred altar.
The assembly of ritualists, reverently invoking the Fire Virtue Star Lord’s incantation as spoken by the Most High, bow in homage and devotion, chanting in praise.

With devoted hearts, we pay homage and sincerely worship:
The Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal.
With devoted hearts, we pay homage and sincerely worship:
The Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal.

The incantation is formed with the *mao-xu* mudra, drawing the *qi* of *mao* and *xu*.
Envision the Palace of Vermilion Fire Refinement—may the True Lord be present as if in person.
Dragon and phoenix sprout sharp edges, their majestic radiance emanating in all ten directions.
Cinnabar hardness gleams through the five watches of night; vermilion flames blaze along the three borders.
Crystal clarity aligns with the upright *qi*; swords and halberds grasp the authority of arms.
Rushing and seizing, they respond by vanquishing the near; comets and broom stars dare not advance.

*Response:* May this lamp’s light be turned toward the True Lord.
Scatter flowers.
The wisdom torch blazes resplendent, Heavenly Worthy.

The assembly of ritualists, with devoted hearts, pay homage to the Divine Aid Palace:
The Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal,
The Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal,
The immortals within the palace,
And all the spirit officials.

Reverently kindling the Seven Luminaries Lamp of the Jade Balance, we present the image of the Earth Virtue Star of the Central Palace.
We have heard that in ancient rites, the earth was venerated at the altar, harmonizing with the earth’s proper order.
The virtue of the divine aligns with the Dao of Heaven.
Auspicious stone inscriptions were offered, and yin and yang prospered under the Tang;
Lucky clods appeared in the wild, and the gods lent their support to the Jin.
When Qin conquered Shu, the omens of Baogu Valley were no mere oddity;
When Liu swallowed Huan, the Xianbei’s dream was no coincidence.
The filial son of the Zong clan buried his father and revealed hidden merit;
The Iron-Wheel King’s acts of giving fulfilled karmic causes.
The great ship of Hong Gui may be relied upon—
The virtuous governance of Xu Jiang endures through the ages.
The sword of Lei Huan may shine ever brighter—
The sacred proximity of Huayin remains as if a thousand years have not passed.
Mixing sand with wine, it once served as a remedy for illness given to Prefect Gao;
Forming dust into pills, it once became a life-saving elixir from the immortals’ presence.
By virtue of Huang’s goodness, his numinous power is manifest.

We reflect upon all sentient beings: ants clinging to fleeting lives, wall-insects clinging to their dullness.
Evil abounds while good is scarce—how can there be no shortfall by even a single basket?
The Buddhas of the past have shown that even they could not avoid being reborn a hundred times.
To suppress demons in filth and dust—what use is there?
Yet if they wallow in the mire, can they truly be abandoned?

From this day forth, following the correct Dao in conduct, how dare we not build walls and rise in reverence?
We humbly pray:
May Mount Hua store its essence, so that scholars may be born with keen intelligence;
May gold be valued equally, so that merchants may prosper in trade.
May artisans refine their skills and reap the rewards of their labor;
May the pulse of fertile soil quicken, so that farmers may toil in the fields.
Striking the stone chimes and sounding the qing, we roughly perform the rites of drum and mallet;
Pouring water and offering flowers, we are ashamed to lack the tribute of finest jade.

The assembly of ritualists, reverently following the Earth Virtue Star Lord’s divine incantation as spoken by the Most High, bow in homage and devotion, chanting in earnest praise.

With devoted hearts, we pay homage and sincerely worship:
The Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal.
With devoted hearts, we pay homage and sincerely worship:
The Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal.

The incantation is formed with the *zi-chou* mudra, drawing the *qi* of *zi* and *chou*.
Envision the Palace of the Yellow Center’s Primordial *Qi*—may the True Lord be present as if in person.
The lofty heavens align with *wu* and *ji*; hidden lands rise through layered skies.
The Five Phases honor the obscured luminaries; the Nine Heavens reveal shining light.
Gan and Shi calculated the movements of Liu and Fu; Tao and Wu divined the depths of emptiness.
The immortals bestow rain and dew; prostrating on the earth, we bow to the empty void.

*Response:* May this lamp’s light be turned toward the True Lord.
Scatter flowers.
The divine light blazes resplendent, Heavenly Worthy.

The assembly of ritualists, with devoted hearts, pay homage to the Divine Aid Palace:
The Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal,
The Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal,
The immortals within the palace,
And all the spirit officials.

Reverently kindling the Seven Luminaries Lamp of the Jade Balance, we present the image of the Metal Virtue Star of the Western Palace, Venus.
We have heard that metal nurtures the essence of Venus, and the West bears its sign.
The divine ranks among the Upper Clarity; the Northern Dipper transforms its form.
Its literary brilliance has long shone on Tiantai; its origins trace back to the Lishui.
Poetry and odes possess a resounding beauty;
Its name inscribed on bells and tripods, it bears a nature of unyielding integrity.
Li Shaojun thereby refined the elixir; Shang’s Fu Yue used it to sharpen his resolve.
As a treasure, it is truly precious;
As an instrument, how could it be taken lightly?
The higher one gazes, the loftier it seems; the deeper one probes, the firmer it becomes.
It is sharply defined, yet harmoniously ordered.

We reflect upon all sentient beings: ashamed of the "four knowings," we admire Yang Zhen’s virtue in vain;
Unable to achieve even "three acquisitions," we vainly envy the wealth of Tao Zhu.
From this day forward, in forging and reforming, we truly rely on the power of smelting and shaping.
We humbly pray:
May scriptures and fruits remain unburned, and the teachings of the full basket bring joy;
May culture not yet be lost, and the sound of jade striking the ground still be heard.
If words can be acted upon and names spoken, the promises of the Chu people will be as steadfast as Ji Bu’s.
If sages emulate Heaven and worthies emulate sages, the disciples of Confucius will not be limited to Yan Hui alone.
Ashamed that we lack the grand treasures to present, we offer only the modest tribute of ritual vessels.

The assembled ritualists, in strict accordance with the divine incantation of the Golden Virtue Star Lord as expounded by the Most High, prostrate in reverent devotion and chant with sincere praise.

With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and pay homage
To the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palaces.
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and pay homage
To the Nine Heavens’ Jade Palaces.

The incantation is formed with the *chen-you* mudra, drawing the *qi* of *chen* and *you*.
We visualize the True Lord of the Golden Heaven’s Luminous Palace as though present.

Venerable Venus ascends the limpid Han,
Frost-laden brilliance gleams with pristine radiance.
Lofty it floats in auspicious splendor,
Resplendent it shines as the resurgent Star of Longevity.
Its blade, towering, repels invaders;
Its hue, lustrous, ever subdues armies.
Exhaustively it accords with fate’s reckoning,
Uniting with the Dao to attain immortality.

*Response:* May this lamplight be directed toward the True Lord.
Scatter flowers.
The Radiant Nurturer of the Luminous Heavenly Venerable.

The assembled ritualists, with wholehearted devotion, prostrate and entrust their lives to the numinous efficacy of the Lingji Palace—
The Nine Heavens’ Golden Palaces,
The Nine Heavens’ Jade Palaces,
The immortals within the palaces,
And all the divine officials.

We reverently kindle the Seven Luminaries Lamp of the Celestial Balance,
Arranging above the constellation of the Northern Water Virtue’s *Chen* Star.
We have heard that the spirit of water is called Dark Depth,
Its source profound, its flow far-reaching.
Like water beneath the earth, where does it not reach?
Where does it not flow unimpeded?
Vast and boundless—how can I name its power?
Abyssal and fathomless—truly beyond measure.

Speak of its benevolence, and fish and turtles find their place.
Speak of its majesty, and dragons and spirits submit.
Whirling sands and bending waves once revealed the dream of the Three Isles.
Rising clouds and summoning rain are revered in the shrines of the Four Rivers.
Crossing the frozen Fen and Tuo, how divine were the words of kings and hegemons!
Leveling Huai and Cai with snow, was Li Su’s merit not heaven-sent?
All equally receive its moistening, downward-flowing kindness—
Dare we now make our plea to the Eastern Dawn?

We reflect upon all sentient beings:
At the Thieves’ Spring, they quench thirst—how gluttonous and unworthy!
The muddy Wei flows ever on, making foulness reek of itself.
We must earnestly cleanse and purify,
Lest we sink into dissipation.

We humbly pray:
May the courts enjoy peace, and the pearls return to Hepu.
May talents flourish and prosper, and boats cross mighty rivers.
When mulberries in the cleared groves ripen, silkworms will ascend early.
When swords in barren lands are sold, oxen may be raised.
The wellsprings of wealth and profit will accumulate—
Abundant, what more could be added? It is called enrichment.
The streams of descendants will flow long—
After great virtue, there must be those who rise.
May grace overflow like waves,
And blessings run as deep as the ocean.

We offer but the humble rites of transient streams,
Deeply ashamed of the meagerness of hoofprints in a puddle.

The assembled ritualists, in strict accordance with the divine incantation of the Water Virtue Star Lord as expounded by the Most High, prostrate in reverent devotion and chant with sincere praise.

With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and pay homage
To the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palaces.
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and pay homage
To the Nine Heavens’ Jade Palaces.

The incantation is formed with the *si-shen* mudra, drawing the *qi* of *si* and *shen*.
We visualize the True Lord of the Dark Numinous Palace of Great Virtue as though present.

Wondrous! The tally of the Five *Qi*,
Dimly we perceive the True Gate.
Towering, it stands in the *chou* position,
The *ren* and *gui* spirits of the cavernous depths.
Its radiance divides and congeals in purity,
Its gaze and offering attend our devout remembrance.
Immortal songs and dances accompany the Dao,
After a long while, descending from the Golden Heaven.

*Response:* May this lamplight be directed toward the True Lord.
Scatter flowers.
The Dragon Virtue Universally Illuminating Heavenly Venerable.

Reciting scriptures and incantations,
The merits of the lamp-lighting just performed are now complete.

We have heard that observing the celestial patterns reveals human affairs, enabling foresight.
Cultivating human affairs in accord with celestial patterns brings unerring auspiciousness.
We must rely on the divine lamp for illumination,
And specially invoke the ritual canons for proclamation.
We redirect these merits to the True Lords,
Humbly beseeching their numinous favor.

From this day forward, may their power be grandly manifested.
We humbly pray:
May stars gather in *Kui*, and we again witness the governance of literary brilliance.
May light be contained in *Bi*, and the pristine customs of antiquity return.
Above, may they embody Heaven’s intent;
Below, may they fulfill the people’s hopes.

Furthermore, after the lighting of the lamps,
May the Five Planets follow their proper courses, and the Two Luminaries increase in splendor.
May cold and heat not stray from their seasons,
And all people be raised to benevolence and longevity.
May rain and sunshine arrive in due time,
And the hundred grains enjoy abundant harvests.
May all creatures with consciousness
Be nurtured by transformation.

We rely upon the vast assembly,
To forge the finest karmic affinity.

*Recitation:*

The Three Pure Ones and the Two Realms Heavenly Worthies,
The Nine Heavens’ Bestowers of Blessings Heavenly Worthies,
The Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies—
Whose merits are beyond all thought.

The *Star-Lamp Rite of the Seven Celestial Regulators* now complete,
The *Secret Canon of the Immortal Consorts* enters the altar.
*Stepping the Void:*
At the dawn of primordial chaos,
Yin and yang transformed and gave birth.
The Nine Heavens perfected the Dao’s transformation,
And the myriad lands preserved peace.

The jeweled throne descends upon the golden hall,
Crimson coronets radiate in the jade pavilion.
The ten thousand perfected gather at the imperial abode,
Soaring on rainbow hues with roots of luminous blossoms.

*Offering of Incense:*
Auspicious smoke coils into talismanic script,
Fortunate qi congeals in the void.
Gazing toward the azure vault, we pledge sincerity;
Beholding the Purple Clarity, we bow in reverence.
With reverence, we offer the incense of the Dao,
The incense of virtue,
The incense of non-action,
The pure incense of non-action,
The naturally pure incense,
The wondrous cavernous true incense,
The numinous treasure’s gracious incense,
The incense transcending the Three Realms—
Filling the jasper towers and jade halls,
Pervading all celestial immortal realms.
In utmost devotion, we present these offerings to:
The Heavenly Mother of the Nine Heavens, the Supreme Empress of the Primordial Lord;
The Empress of Earth, the August Thearch of the Sustaining Soil, who responds to the vast assembly;
The Holy Mother of the Eight Poles, Governess of the Law and Benevolent Abode;

The Waterside Enfeoffment of the Vast Blessings Chen Fifteen Ladies,
The Thirty-Six Palace Grannies.

Moreover, that which is beyond knowing is called the divine—
Responsive when moved,
The people to this day receive its bounty,
Yet none may forget.

To this day, we have attained such blessings—daring not to invoke the Mandate of the Supreme Emperor. With utmost reverence and awe, I bow my head again and again, humbly acknowledging the formless beyond, the essence of the Supreme Dao.

The Yellow Emperor unlocked its gates and drew forth its bolts;
The Most High Lord Lao transmitted its lamp and continued its seal.
Virtue yet not virtue—pure emptiness, wondrous and strange,
The silent void without origin,
Mystery upon mystery,
Vast and boundless,
The marvelous workings of generation upon generation.
It courses through the Six Voids without cease,
Governing the myriad things without omission.
How majestic its accomplishments—
No words suffice to praise its awe-inspiring power.

I reflect that my aspirations seek the Dao,
Yet my talents fall short of others.
In presenting this petition with words,
Even the steps of my heart’s ground,
I wish to borrow diligent reverence for my duty,
That I may not transgress the divine majesty within a foot’s reach.

Further considering we, the ritual leaders,
Have devoted ourselves to the sacred threads,
Invoking blessings through the temple of Lingji,
Our names recorded in illustrious enfeoffment.
Resounding is its fame,
Radiant its numinous power.
Harmonious within the palace,
Solemn within the temple.
Though mulberry and catalpa command reverence,
Only the humble offerings of duckweed may be presented.
On this morning of Zhongyuan, when blessings are gathered,
It is also the dawn of the Prime Minister’s birth.
Heaven and Earth bestow auspicious signs,
And the village resounds with joy.
This month stands at the center,
Fitting to echo the ode of Song Gao’s birth in Shen.
May his years match the heavens,
And his longevity extend with the tripartite felicitations of Hua.
Such is the sincerity of our birthday prayers.

Thus, we prostrate ourselves before the Jade Emperor of the Luminous Heaven,
Whose august presence governs the ten directions,
Whose great deeds are established through kalpas uncounted.
No distance is too far, no nearness too close—
All equally bathed in his illumination.
The nine lands and all beings of blood and breath
Revere and serve none but him.

We now reverently proclaim with utmost sincerity: Your servant, dust-bound and impure, has served with trepidation day and night. Ashamed of my dullness and ignorance, how dare I presume to stand before the Most High, yet I fast, bathe, and purify myself to serve the Emperor. To respond to the Heavenly Presence—this is what is meant by the divine: all-hearing, all-seeing, upright, and just. With reverence in my station, I am fortunate to gaze upon the sun through parting clouds, as though treading on thin ice over an abyss. Though my prayers may go unheard, though my deeds may remain unseen, I stand before the Way of the Manifest. May the people prosper and flourish, may they grow old in wisdom, and may their blessings be bestowed.

Your servant, overwhelmed with awe, gazes toward the heavens and longs for the sagely presence with utmost urgency.

We now invoke the Immortal Hosts of the Three Primes, the assembled ranks of *pusa* officials, all the immortals gathered for this *jiao* rite, the City God and Lady of the Prefecture and County, the Lady of the Local Domain, the Ladies of the Golden Turtle’s various temples who bestow blessings, all *pusa* officials of this sanctuary, the Incense Officials of the Three Realms, and the Attendants of the Day—by the power of this true incense, we make universal offering.

This incense is the radiant splendor of jade blossoms, the purple qi congealed into mist, a fragrant cloud woven thick, ascending straight to the Nine Heavens. May the Golden Lads who attend the incense and the Jade Maidens who scatter flowers convey our petition, granting all as we beseech. With utmost devotion, we humbly submit our intent, looking up to your compassionate shade, that blessings may extend to all the people.

Now, as the altar of orchids opens the ritual, we bow our heads in reverence, taking refuge in the Boundless Great Dao.

*Chant:*
The assembly of the Dao altar, each turning their minds,
Take refuge in the Three Treasures, all reciting in unison.

*Cold Altar...*
*To the Perfected within the curtain...*
*Contending with Heaven and Earth...*
*Mystery within the Grotto...*
*Rise.*

The Firelight Dispelling Filth, Primordial Sovereign—
Kneeling before the censer:
*The Dao is cultivated through the heart...*
*The Five Stars’ incantation, the Five Stars arrayed in splendor.*

*Ignite the censer—*
*Strike the Dharma Drum twenty-four times.*

O Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, First Three Qi, Most Exalted Lord Lao, summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Incense Officials and Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Riding Couriers, the Golden Lads who attend the incense, the Jade Maidens who scatter flowers, the Twenty-Four Officers and Generals of the Five Directions and the Day—let them emerge with solemn dignity.

Let the local earth gods and domain deities of this place emerge. Your servant now, in the act of burning incense and performing the Dao, respectfully petitions on behalf of [name/purpose], with all sincerity as set forth in the written prayer. With this invocation, may the Primordial Qi of the Ten Directions’ True and Upright Ones descend and flow into our bodies, that our petition may swiftly reach the presence of the Queen Mother of the Nine Heavens, the August Empress of the Dao.

*Announce the Dharma Titles:*
The humble one now petitions the Queen Mother of the Nine Heavens, the August Empress of the Dao—
Her sacred station as before.

We reverently acknowledge that when the Three Powers first divided, the human way was established between Heaven and Earth. The sages of old were apportioned their offices, and the Emperor and Empress were entrusted with the registers of life and destiny. Humans, being most noble, hold a duty most exalted. They nurture the po and refine the form, beginning with the inscription of life at the Southern Culmen. They manifest good and punish evil, then assign destinies under the celestial palaces. We look up to the thirty-six august sovereigns, who truly govern the lives of countless beings. Wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness are fixed at the moment of conception. Longevity and early death, short and long lives—all are held in their grasp. Above, they uphold the majestic commands of the celestial bureaus; below, they respond to the prayers of worldly descendants. Those born into families of accumulated virtue are blessed with wisdom and wealth, while those born after accumulated transgressions suffer lowliness and early demise. Their judgment is impartial, not a hair’s breadth swayed by favor. Yet if one turns a single thought toward refuge, the hundred spirits will surely witness it.

Now, with utmost reverence and devotion, we bow our heads in sincerity. Presuming to present the rites of this *jiao* offering, we bend every effort to express our earnest plea. We take refuge in the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors and Empresses above, and the divine attendants of the Sacred Aid Immortal Consorts. We humbly pray that you mount the clouds and ride the cranes, arraying your divine procession to descend. Ascend the void and ride the phoenix, answering the earnest prayers of mortals. The ritual assembly, with utmost devotion, takes refuge and makes this invocation.

Since the welcoming rites above and below have been performed, all the immortals of the inner and outer palaces have descended. We now request that the immortal ranks be arrayed with solemnity to receive the divine presence.

Your servant respectfully petitions.

May the Earth Kings, Radiant Kings, and the Venerable Mother of the Jambudvīpa World, the Six Perils Emperors and Empresses, in their Dao compassion, descend to take their thrones. May the Nine Heavens’ Inspecting and Investigating Holy Mother, the Demon-Quelling Empress; the Heavenly Net’s Registry-Holding Holy Mother, the Jade Perfection Empress; the Eight Directions’ Surveillance Holy Mother, the Golden Light Empress; the Southern Culmen’s Nurturing Holy Mother, the Fire Light Empress; the Eastern Culmen’s Life-Preserving Holy Mother, the Azure-Clad Empress; the Dharma-Governing and Virtue-Gathering Holy Mother, the Eight Directions’ Empress; the Earth Deity Empress who Upholds the Dao and Emulates Heaven; and the Primordial Empress of the Nine Heavens’ Dao Mother—having been invoked above, now grace us with their descent. With utmost devotion, the assembly offers this ritual service.

Within the jade hall, dragon thrones are arrayed—may all the heavens swiftly descend.
With a heart’s sincerity, we take refuge in the Great Dao; our prayers align with the mind’s intent.
Vases hold flowers wafting musk, censers’ smoke curls in fragrant tendrils.
Thrice we raise our wisdom in supplication, praying for profound blessings of grace.

*Step of Emptiness*
The precious throne descends upon the golden hall, its rosy crown gleaming in jade stillness.
Ten thousand immortals pay homage at the imperial abode, their flying slippers rooted in clouds of radiance.

*Hymn of Seated Peace*
The throne of the Nine Heavens, jade table and dragon seat,
Golden light illumines, a hundred treasures shine.
All heavens descend, the great and upright flourish.
Receiving this precious throne, may elder brothers know peace and tranquility.
Fire-pears and immortal dates,
Jade-like nectar peaches,
Jade flowers and wax candles,
Sweet dew and clarified butter,
Jade springs and auspicious dew,
Phoenix tea and dragon sprouts—
The heavenly kitchens’ fragrant offerings appear at thought’s bidding.

We have heard that when clarity and turbidity were first divided and yin and yang took their places,
Heaven and Earth conjoined to bear the Six Sons, and in their harmony nurtured all living beings.
How much more so the Primordial Empress of the Dao Mother,
Who alone upholds the teachings of yin.
Moreover, the wombs of the world below depend entirely on her sacred grace.
All mortal forms flow within the Three Realms, each a sign of the six yin’s inception.
Those who accumulate goodness see their descendants multiply;
Those who hoard evil watch their branches wither.
Every prayer is answered, no plea goes unheeded.
Bestow sons, and they shall be endowed with wisdom and intelligence;
Grant daughters, and they shall be blessed with beauty and grace.
In an instant, she rescues from life and death; in a fleeting moment, she dispels calamity.
Rewarding virtue and punishing excess, she holds to an unchanging decree.
Wielding the scales of rectitude, she repels evil and saves the lives of all beings.
When the Nine Spirits are revered, resonance is assured.

We, though unworthy, have been born as human beings and are fortunate to live in this flourishing age.
Following the Dao’s transformation through the various offices, we propagate the great Dharma in its numinous emptiness.
Thus, we purify the sacred altar and reverently invite the true lords.
Fragrant incense rises like a jeweled canopy, auspicious signs ascend before the jade hall’s terrace.
Flowers scatter like jade blossoms, their fragrance perfuming the Jade Capital’s mountain.
With hearts steadfast in sincerity, we reach the offering; through virtue, its fragrance spreads.
In gratitude for sacred grace, we confess our transgressions.
May she uphold us in perpetuity and safeguard childbearing without peril.
We array this splendid feast to extend our boundless blessings.

May auspicious light descend, and the holy consorts protect all living beings.
May the cloud-borne chariots deign to arrive, descending upon this ritual feast to witness our merit and virtue.
Through fragrant incense, we connect with the sublime; through utmost sincerity, we convey our devotion.
The sacred work is impartial, its luminous insight all-pervading.

Today, we pray that the present Emperor, Empress, and all officials
May enjoy longevity equal to heaven, their descendants flourishing day by day.
May their lineage’s distant origins flourish, their jade-like splendor ever radiant.
May their virtuous teachings spread beyond the shifting sands, and war cease in the northern deserts.
May the people delight in their labors, blessed with timely winds and rains.
May the barbarians of the north return to benevolence, and the frontier multitudes find peace.
May auspicious fungi be offered, and purple bamboo present its omens.
May all within the four seas and under heaven return to the Way.

We, in our presumption and temerity, bow our heads in reverence.
We offer incense, present tea, and pour wine in the initial libation.
Scatter flowers upon the clouds—
Before all the perfected, we make our offerings.

Again, we invoke the ranks of the Dharma, addressing the sacred thrones as before.

We have heard that at the center of the earth’s expanse lies the gathering place of all living beings,
And upon the earth’s body resides the revered deity who oversees destinies.
She governs the registers of life within the various palaces and oversees infants in their allotted lifespans.
She determines good and evil, granting or withholding as she deems fit.
She divides yin and yang, assigning gender—female or male.
Not a hair’s breadth is biased; every fate is fixed by measure.

Now, for so-and-so, who prays for myriad blessings to come and a thousand auspices to gather,
For descendants’ fortunes to flourish and households to prosper,
For generations of worthiness and hopes of boundless posterity—
We reverently beseech the Primordial Empress of the Nine Heavens’ Dao Mother, the Sacred Aid Immortal Consorts,
And the attendant immortals who uphold the registers of life, relying on their grace to safeguard birth.
Deliver and save the people of the world; may they live in peace and the age be redeemed.
Release the transgressions already recorded and protect nurturing without peril.

With utmost sincerity, we cultivate merit and virtue, lifting our prayers to beseech the compassionate shade’s shelter over the field of the self.

We humbly pray that the nine generations and seven ancestors, all karmic kin from past kalpas,
Be delivered from the dark paths and ascend to the blessed realms.
May their names be inscribed in the Southern Palace’s register of life, their transgressions erased from the Northern Bureau’s ledger of faults.
Bestowed with sacred peaches, may they extend their years to three thousand;
Granted fiery jujubes, may their lifespans stretch across ten epochs.
May all kin, near and far, equally receive this sheltering grace.

The officiant, with reverent devotion, offers incense, presents tea, and pours wine—now performing the second libation—though this crimson heart holds no worthy offering.

Reverently invoking the sacred ranks,
[Officiant’s title and address as before,]
We prostrate and declare:

We have heard that the great deities of the Four Waterways truly govern the gathering of life,
While the vital qi of the Five Peaks transcribes the finest essence into humanity.
Though the watery palaces lie in distant obscurity, they are the very ground where infants take form—
No plea goes unanswered, no supplication unheeded.

Now, for so-and-so, who truly relies on this boundless grace,
May deepest wishes be eternally fulfilled, blessings flow to descendants, and prosperity extend through the lineage’s roots and branches.
May sons all attain wealth and nobility with keen intelligence,
And daughters be virtuous and fair, blessed with auspicious countenance.
May no evil defile them, no illness assail them,
All equally cherished by nurturing kindness, each rejoicing in the joy of life’s fulfillment.

Relying on this single thought of devotion, we look up to the merciful ones for their radiant witness.

Reverently beseeching...

To the Celestial Dao Mother, Supreme Empress of the Primordial Origin, and the Divine Consort of Numinous Salvation, with their attendant immortals—

We humbly pray that in the Jade Terrace’s halls, past transgressions from former kalpas be absolved, and in the Trāyastriṃśa heavens, blessings and emoluments be bestowed upon this present life. May the lineage flourish for a hundred generations, rich in prosperity and blessed with many sons. May distant descendants multiply like spreading branches, their clans expanding in kinship. May peace and felicity be preserved, mother and child untroubled. May no evil assail them, and may the hundred spirits ever guard them.

We, unworthy as we are, dare to trespass upon your grace again and again, prostrating ourselves in utmost reverence. We offer incense, present tea, pour wine, and humbly dedicate these offerings. We scatter flowers. All assembled in this Daoist ritual, each with sincere heart, chant and recite according to the proper rites. The *Scripture of the Southern Culmen on Bestowing Life* is now concluded. The memorial is solemnly proclaimed in gratitude.

The preceding petition has been respectfully presented. The sagely nature is impartial—surely it will deign to witness and respond. Now, with another offering of precious incense, we reverently address the Celestial Dao Mother, Supreme Empress of the Primordial Origin, the Divine Consort of Numinous Salvation, and all the perfected lords of this rite.

We have heard that when yin and yang converge, the myriad beings take form; when heaven and earth intermingle in primordial qi, the hosts of spirits manifest their signs. From the inception of the One Origin, the Two Modes were distinguished. Though the Dao Mother is the progenitor of all yin, the Empress is the mother of the ten thousand heavens. She wields the handle of life and formation, holding authority over progeny and succession. She safeguards life to protect infants, commands the expulsion of pestilence, and averts calamities—her compassion saves the suffering. Moved by the plight of sentient beings, she vows to shield the people, her boundless grace flowing through the ages.

We, fortunate to live in this flourishing era and behold the bonds of human kinship, look up in gratitude for the gift of life. May she graciously extend her hidden protection, upholding the wondrous Dao of precelestial origin to succor the people of the lower realms. Wherever utmost sincerity is offered, the power of resonance is surely attained. We now present our earnest pleas, reverently offering these fragrant supplications. Her sagely virtue is impartial, her hidden merit uncalculating. We look up in hope of her radiant witness, that she may bestow vast and enduring blessings.

We humbly pray that her phoenix chariot may pause awhile, her crane carriage tarry briefly. May past □ transgressions be pardoned, that mother and child may dwell in peace. May her grace be granted, bringing felicity to the inner chambers. Now, we—along with all officials and participants of this altar—acknowledge our karmic burdens from former kalpas to this present life: transgressions born of jealousy and harm, sins woven from wayward desire, debts recorded in the palaces of sun and moon, or bound in the celestial and terrestrial bureaus. We implore that all be absolved, that all may equally receive her benevolent protection.

May our names be inscribed in the Register of Longevity, our descendants’ names recorded for posterity. May we be granted wise and bright grandchildren from the celestial palaces. May distant ancestors and close kin alike see their descendants flourish. May inner and outer relations, roots and branches, thrive in glory. May the impurities of the mortal world not stain them, and the pestilences of the seasons not invade. Whether in water or on land, whether soaring or hidden, may all fulfill the nature of their lives.

Above, may this manifest the Empress’s virtue in safeguarding life; below, may it fulfill our devotion in taking refuge. We respectfully submit this for your celestial hearing.

**The Ten Invocations:**
First invocation: The yang of the Dao unfolds.
Second invocation: The Two Modes engender one another.
Third invocation: The Three Officials absolve sins.
Fourth invocation: The Four Courts bestow life.
Fifth invocation: The Five Phases harmonize in sequence.
Sixth invocation: The Six Palaces flourish in glory.
Seventh invocation: The Seven Stars follow their proper courses.
Eighth invocation: The Eight Directions abide in perpetual peace.
Ninth invocation: The Nine Mysteries escape suffering.
Tenth invocation: The transformation of the Dao prevails.

The incense is offered anew.

May the ministers summon the Fragrant Official Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Armies, the Incense-Bearing Envoys, and all attending spirit-officials of the present mandate. Here, where your servant burns incense and practices the Dao, gold fluid naturally arises, and cinnabar-green mushroom blossoms spontaneously appear. The hundred spirits and host of perfected beings gather before this incense burner. May the myriad heavens bestow their blessings, and may the entire household receive grace.

May the golden lads and jade maidens of the ten directions attend the rising incense smoke, swiftly conveying the sincerity of your servant’s earlier supplications directly to the Celestial Empress, the Primordial Sovereign of the Nine Heavens. With the ritual offerings now complete, we humbly receive her merciful grace, bowing reverently to send her off with repeated obeisance.

**Hymn of Sending Forth the Perfected:**
The ranks of the Nine Heavens stand in solemn array along the clouded avenues.
Golden lads and jade maidens bear jeweled canopies and banners.
The ladies of the celestial palaces take their places in the vanguard.
Heavenly incense fills the air with fragrance; golden lotus candles blaze.
Yellow banners and leopard-tail standards, jade scepters and dragon chariots—
Riding the clouds, they depart, returning to the Great Canopy Heaven.
Your servant gazes after them as the fragrant wind fades into stillness.
The Dao Mother bestows her mysterious teachings; the radiant blossoms return to the Grotto-Heaven.
The golden censer’s incense still curls; the jade candles’ flames yet burn.
Gazing upward, my heart remains in her presence; in longing pursuit, my will cannot advance.
May the blessings we beseech flow forth; may the ritual’s sponsor enjoy enduring years.

With the ritual offerings now complete, we pray that her merciful countenance may grant blessings and bestow grace. Together, we rely on this virtuous merit to realize the supreme Dao.

All here pay reverence.
Dedication.
Transformation of paper offerings.

**Conclusion of the Divine Maiden’s Secret Rites**

**Raising the Banner Rite of the Palace:**
The banner of the state-assisting adept stands tall, its sacred streamer soaring into the vast sky.
The myriad people gaze in devotion, turning toward the Dao; the two immortals manifest their glory, and blessings multiply in splendor.
Rain moistens the jade realm, nourishing the three paths; sunlight illumines the dragon script, penetrating the nine nights.
The chanting resounds beneath the golden turtle’s twin towers, where embodied beings receive deliverance and boundless joy.

We humbly submit: the Dao aligns with the heart, and the immortal rites are fully prepared for the covenant with the Perfected. The banner, lifted by the wind, serves as a numinous model to augment blessings and grace. As we, still bound by worldly dust, pray for peace in the turning seasons, may the lunar essence and solar spirit not obscure the moments of breath. In heaven’s halls and earth’s prisons, let awakening and reflection prevail. Recognize the wisdom of those who came before, like the tortoise and oracle; let your resolve grow firmer than the pine and cypress.

A thousand jun of precious jade cannot buy back youth; the long rope of ten thousand kalpas cannot restrain the fleeting sun. Filth and desire press like boiling snow; knowing repentance, sins may yet be dissolved. The world is but emptiness, yet the Yellow Springs record all. Moved by compassion for the departed and grief for the lost, we invoke the present to reach the hidden souls. Shedding past karma and severing illusory ties, we plant the seeds of numinous blessings to extend grace.

How dare we expect blessings unearned? How can fortune be sought for oneself alone? When people cultivate good fruits, heaven’s blessings surely follow. A boat adrift at midnight strays amid ten thousand ravines; a flower plucked before spring bears fruit at the head of all blossoms. With wholehearted devotion and diligent practice, one awakens to the Dao’s freedom. Those who seek permanence shall attain long life. Thus, we perform this rite to dispel calamity and distress, that one may pass through suffering unscathed and the body be suffused with light.

The assembly, in reverent sincerity, raises the sacred name:

**Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Banner Who Absolves Sins**
The banner soars aloft; misfortunes and calamities vanish.
Heaven’s mercy opens the amnesty, boundless across the ten directions.
The living and the dead receive grace, all benefiting without limit.
Goodness is rewarded; cultivation is never forgotten.
Swiftly realize true emptiness, escaping impermanence.
A century of peace and well-being, guiding the reins to heaven’s halls.

*Response:* May we attain long life.

The banners rise high, following the freedom of flight.
Deep sins are wholly erased; past foolishness is awakened.
If sins dwell at the banner’s base, they may be dissolved.
If sins are ground away before the banner, they may be absolved.
Though stained as one condemned by law, one may yet awaken with a willing heart.
Strive for self-realization.
With a luminous mind, one gains blessings in abundance.
Bearing auspicious gatherings to unfold splendor, bestowing long years in celebration.
May we flourish in sublime fortune, ever praying for compassion.

The assembly, in reverent sincerity, raises the sacred name:

**Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled Banner Who Extends Blessings**
The banner’s measure, long or short, accords with its symbol.
Blessings follow the banner; sins are ground away toward fortune.
Its mysteries are revealed, sweeping away karmic obstacles.
Long life and added years, delivering countless beings.

*Response:* May we attain long life.

Sins may indeed be absolved; blessings may be extended.
Yet if sins accumulate unceasingly, how can one claim all misdeeds are ended?
If blessings are extended without reflection, how dare one rest complacent?
To act recklessly and err is to deeply betray the meaning of reverent cultivation.
Bound souls suffer blows, ever caught between past and future lapses.
Departed spirits sink in darkness, their beginnings and ends unguarded.
Reflect on past mistakes; let no fault mar the numinous banner.
Do not idly let a hundred years of white hair pass, drifting through life.
Who says a single verse of gold surpasses all? It is but expedient teaching.
Thus, we grasp the root and lift the tail, holding fast from beginning to end.
To preserve goodness for the future, we rely further on the merciful honored ones.

The assembly, in reverent sincerity, raises the sacred name:

**Heavenly Worthy of Deliverance and Contemplating Emptiness**
Through kalpas without end, the illusory mechanisms persist.
Heaven opens the source, washing clean the body.
Disasters forever cease; blessings and prosperity converge.
Enduring years, undying, merging with the Dao in truth.

*Response:* May we attain long life.

We humbly pray that, having planted the seeds of merit, the imperial realm may stand firm, and the emperor’s Dao flourish afar. May the myriad people rejoice in peace, and the four barbarians submit to transformation. May all beings receive grace, blessings spread abundantly, sins dissolve, and good fortune gather. May the living gain blessings, and the hidden realms receive grace.

For these causes, we invoke:
The Heavenly Worthies of the Three Clarities and Three Realms,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows Blessings from the Nine Heavens,
The Heavenly Worthies of the Numinous Treasure of the Ten Directions,
and their inconceivable merits.

**Conclusion of the Banner-Raising Rite of the Palace.**

**Divine Oracle of the Palace of Vast Grace and Numinous Aid**
**First Oracle – Supreme Auspice**
The dragon’s strategies and leopard’s tactics roll forth with marvelous plans.
When encountering enlightened times, present your schemes.
The world’s ways are fraught with storms and fierce currents;
better to dwell in stillness, carefully weighing rise and fall.

**Second Oracle – Supreme Supreme Auspice**
Auspicious dreams foretell good fortune first;
delve deep to find what truly pleases the heart.
Though a son may not fulfill the bow’s ambition,
high office shall yet come with another jade scepter.

**Third Oracle – Medium Auspice**
When the Green Emperor reigns at the appointed hour,
crimson and pale green adorn the flowering branches.
If the Western Wind rises one night in Shanglin Park,
does the traveler in the heavens know or not?

**Fourth Oracle – Inauspicious**
Tribal strife wounds all, and all is vain—
his benevolence, my righteousness, yet we return to the start.
Like Zou Yang imprisoned, the message sinks into silence;
who will present the plea of Lady Tiying?

**Fifth Oracle – Great Auspice**
When asking of the road ahead, rein in your haste;
better to cross the calm river with boat and oar.
Tonight the bright moon reaches its fullest,
and the cloud-lit thoroughfare stretches ten thousand miles.

**Sixth Oracle – Great Auspice**
A single current surges eastward,
while people stand gazing at the vastness.
At Western Mountain, dogs bark beneath wind and moon—
from here, the path to the azure clouds lies open.

**Seventh Oracle – Inauspicious**
A frail, ailing body defies all medicine;
hold back the finest remedies and prescriptions.
When Rabbit meets Ram, fortune will come at last—
lest joy turn to sorrow, take care.

**Eighth Oracle – Medium-Lower Auspice**
Losing an ox or a horse brings no cause for grief;
why fret over worldly affairs and seek needless trouble?
If it be early spring or late winter,
let the fair one not seek counsel by the roadside.

**Ninth Oracle – Inauspicious**
Thin clouds and lingering mist block the gate;
east, west, south, north—none flow freely.
Cast your lot where life takes you;
as autumn’s leaf falls, the crow flies past the wild goose.

**Tenth Oracle**
Though rumors fill the hall, pay them no heed—
even false words should not be trusted.
A man’s marriage will end in good fortune;
hesitation unresolved may yet see matters resolved.

**Eleventh Oracle**
Broken seals reveal vermilion edicts in rows;
ten thousand miles of azure clouds rise in joy.
The osprey soars across the sky—good tidings come—
do not linger in the mountains or beneath the trees.

**Twelfth Oracle**
In the cold valley, yang returns, surpassing nature’s craft;
idle blossoms need not blame the spring wind.
Though news from afar may seem desolate,
the cardamom branch bears its fragrance with intent.

**Thirteenth Oracle**
When perch grows fat and autumn thoughts arise,
a thousand acres of waves await the hook.
The gull reveals the mechanism, flying in vain—
how can one bear the full moon filling the returning boat?

**Fourteenth Oracle**
With strength on my side and weakness on theirs, I plant the banner of surrender;
do not speak of injustice to the traveler.
Though rain clears and clouds disperse, the storm is not yet stilled—
only when the spring wind arrives will all become clear.

**Fifteenth Oracle**
Why measure and weigh again and again?
Wings poised for flight aim southward.
Yet suddenly, messages bring obstruction—
if the matter succeeds, it may yet prove unbearable.

**Sixteenth Oracle – Inauspicious**
A lone soldier wanders at the edge of the sky;
the tiger lurks in the *yin* direction, while home is longed for.
Day by day, the spirit fades, and word is lost—
a branch of pear blossoms, rain-laden, slants.

**Seventeenth Oracle – Medium-Lower Auspice**
When the Vermilion Bird governs the *bing* direction,
do not dwell on the misfortune of descendants.
Where the wind and waves are calm, step forward;
beware the sting of wasps and the harm of ginger—do not wound yourself.

**Eighteenth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
A noble guest at Dragon Gate brings fresh joy;
in the celestial thoroughfare, wings cling to scales.
Casually ask of the path of patronage—
the Rabbit’s modest talent sighs over broken kindling.

**Nineteenth Oracle – Official Matters**
Ten thousand changes on the branch refuse to cease;
sworn brothers and sworn mothers weave enmity.
Best to swiftly resolve past transgressions—
seek the gods’ favor through rites to dispel sorrow.

**Twentieth Oracle – Auspicious**
Peach and plum in the vermilion gate are adorned;
the work of rain and dew shines in radiant sunlight.
At the first strum of wind and cloud, the moment arrives—
do not speak of returning home in brocade too soon.

**Twenty-First Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Why crave wealth and profit so greedily?
Do not trust sweet words that are not yet fully pleasing.
All prosperous merchants reap interest—
joyful hues abound in the southeast.

**Twenty-Second Oracle – Auspicious**
Carriages and travelers come and go as they please;
idle flowers and cold buds press urgently.
Unaided by even a breath of wind’s force,
they steal half the night to bloom over the wall.

**Twenty-Third Oracle – Inauspicious**
It is not that a single heart is hard to find—
do not chase after works that fill ox-carts.
For in the end, causes and conditions will become clear;
who in the groves and springs will recognize true appreciation?

**Twenty-Fourth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Lofty horns stand out among the chickens,
yet the clover’s fragrance refuses to part.
When the osmanthus seed carries its scent, word will come—
one morning, your name will be heard at the emperor’s side.

**Twenty-Fifth Oracle – Inauspicious**
Above, they feed on withered soil; below, the Yellow Springs;
a pair of wild geese fly high, sleeping in two places.
Two rivers flow, yet no one is seen—
the perils of worldly affairs surpass even mountains and streams.

**Twenty-Sixth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Hearts in harmony, intentions aligned, the two unite;
the jade candle shines bright, offering many blessings.
Yet rejoice that the household knows no thieves’ path—
what of the lone star at the door this evening?

**Twenty-Seventh Oracle – Inauspicious**
Fate is harsh, the body in decline—autumn arrives;
ghosts and spirits conspire in darkness.
Beneath wind and moon, amidst flowers and wine,
lest joy turn to sorrow, take heed.

**Twenty-Eighth Oracle – Medium-Lower Auspice**
A limited view can never grasp the workings of the Dao;
nature’s craft is too subtle to emulate.
All worldly affairs are but a game of chess—
dragons and snakes in the east rise and fly as they will.

**Twenty-Ninth Oracle – Upper-Medium Auspice**
The dried fish bows its tail toward the clear stream;
a faint thread of life lingers, nearly spent.
Wait for the third surge of Yu’s Gate—
the bright pearl will not be cast into darkness.

**Thirtieth Oracle – Upper Auspice**
Weary of the world’s shifting cold and heat,
drawing snakes and severing cranes, one loses innocence.
Yet let no delay linger at the gate—
beneath the brush, spring returns, surpassing nature’s art.

**Thirty-First Oracle – Upper Auspice**
Why ask of right and wrong in sorrow?
Observe human affairs to glimpse heaven’s design.
Where people tread the *kan* path, many find contentment—
a single lonely lamp flares anew.

**Thirty-Second Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Jade and stone on Kun Mountain remain undistinguished,
the clamor of clay pots and basins grates the ear.
When the small yields to the great, the time is not yet ripe—
abandon your hundred schemes and cease your toil.

**Thirty-Third Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Sweet and bitter you have tasted through the years,
a lifetime’s six decades passed like frost and stars.
A heart weighed down as if drunk in a worldly dream—
why rush about in vain, enslaved to empty striving?

**Thirty-Fourth Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Between heaven and earth, how many partings and meetings?
Alone you stand, poised to shore up what is frail.
Broken branches, snapped legs—these you cannot escape,
yet the fire that consumes you burns unperceived.

**Thirty-Fifth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Suddenly from level ground a storm arises,
human affairs these years grow tangled and strange.
Like salt and plum entrusted to a master’s hand,
the five flavors blend in perfect harmony.

**Thirty-Sixth Oracle – Upper-Medium Auspice**
Barred by distance, letters and words still go astray,
spring returns to grass and trees, yet light is dim.
The sun sets on Western Mountain, leaving a fading glow—
beyond the heavens, a traveler at last draws near.

**Thirty-Seventh Oracle – Medium Auspice**
When water fills the boat, it shifts in but a moment;
returning alone, you hesitate, doubt arises.
The traveler waits with intent for the bright moon—
why seek the magic herb at the gate to meet?

**Thirty-Eighth Oracle – Lower-Medium Auspice**
Lifting your gaze, a black cloud swells on the horizon,
seeking fame at the edge of the sky, yet fame eludes.
Only when you strike the Yellow Bell will the sound ring true—
a fair wind will bear you to Penglai’s isles.

**Thirty-Ninth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
The river flows west—where is the boat you seek?
How long must you wait for merit to be complete?
Others whisper news to one another—
watch the arrow fly toward autumn’s clouds.

**Fortieth Oracle – Lower Auspice**
What of your quest for wealth and gain?
The northwest wind rises—how will you cross the river?
The pearl that fetches a price must wait awhile—
life is but a dream that drifts to Nanke.

**Forty-First Oracle – Lower Auspice**
A few branches of red and purple vie in fragrance,
petals scatter, drifting on the water’s flow.
Does the swallow nesting in the oriole’s home lack intent?
Refrain from speaking of right and wrong among men.

**Forty-Second Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Chrysanthemums wither, autumn wanes, all things decay,
old regrets and past fears return to haunt.
The black pearl emerges from the sea, its luster still concealed—
point eastward, hang up your cap, and leave it be.

**Forty-Third Oracle – Lower-Medium Auspice**
The azure bird soars into clouds, yet does not return,
trust lingers in the realm of the vague and indistinct.
The sun sets over Qin Tower, thirty thousand miles away—
beyond the white-clouded mountains lie more green peaks.

**Forty-Fourth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Sorrow and joy lean upon each other,
all things at hand—yet you gnaw at desire’s hook.
Time is as fragile as a chicken’s wing or an egg—
soon the dead end will open to a broad thoroughfare.

**Forty-Fifth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Renewal and reform meet with yang’s return,
the traveler at heaven’s edge gains precious wealth.
Turn your head—Lord Yi is but a hand’s span away,
do not doubt or suspect, but act without delay.

**Forty-Sixth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
The chance for fame and fortune meets three lifetimes’ fate,
a roc’s ten-thousand-mile journey lies flat in your palm.
Even the paths of ox and horse cannot compare—
where the *kan* path lies, proceed with caution.

**Forty-Seventh Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Thick clouds emerge from the mountain’s hollow, never at rest,
how many days must pass before you see green peaks again?
A gnat stings, a bee strikes—empty conflict,
yet the world clings to a hollow reputation.

**Forty-Eighth Oracle – Lower-Lower Auspice**
The ways of the world are like children’s games—beyond reason,
when affairs reach their limit, they return to their root.
Clothes lie folded in the chest—guard them well,
do not share divine communion with ghostly words.

**Forty-Ninth Oracle – Upper Auspice (Most Auspicious)**
The farmer’s fields know no year without abundance,
as times change, one turns to ask the old heavens.
The Jade Candle shines, yang is bright, the fish-leaf dream—
when autumn comes, a thousand-fold profit is gained.

**Fiftieth Oracle – Upper-Upper Auspice**
Standing by the river’s edge, you avoid the wind and waves,
heaven’s will follows man’s—what can you do?
Wait until the waters of Yu’s Gate warm in spring—
then ride the raft straight to the River of Heaven.

**Fifty-First Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Human feelings, though old, never match the new,
fifty years pass, and another decade follows.
All matters are decided in the heart—
do not debate building a house by the roadside.

**Fifty-Second Oracle – Lower-Medium Auspice**
The lone lamp’s wick is trimmed, yet sleep does not come,
tears wiped away, emotions linger close at hand.
No word arrives from ten thousand miles away—
then at dawn, the magpie’s call is suddenly heard.

**Fifty-Third Oracle – Upper Auspice (Most Auspicious)**
The times are harmonious, the year abundant, the world at peace,
from here, your hometown’s fortunes turn to prosperity.
The gods rejoice, the people cheer—good fortune is secured,
a lifetime’s heart’s desires at last find fulfillment.

**Fifty-Fourth Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Greedy for wealth, you carve stone—no jade is found,
sifting sand with care—no gold appears.
All your schemes come to naught—
beware the fire that burns the river and the heart of the door.

**Fifty-Fifth Oracle – Upper-Upper Auspice**
Long in Nanyang’s thatched hut beyond the world,
three visits rouse the dragon from its winter sleep.
All under heaven await the life-giving rain—
truly, creation’s work rivals heaven’s power.

**Fifty-Sixth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Weary of the lakes and rivers, tired of the endless road,
your straw sandals worn thin from travel.
A hundred birds return to their nests, knowing the old way,
the moon wanes, then rounds again.

**Fifty-Seventh Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Raindrops fall like petals, snowflakes drift like blossoms,
by the river, the fisherman casts his line.
Night is still, the water cold—fish do not bite,
the boat returns empty at dawn.

**Fifty-Eighth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
The horn bow’s clear reflection gleams in the golden cup,
today’s inquiry dispels suspicion and brings joy.
A knot of doubt unravels, feelings are resolved—
from whence came the deep-seated illness?

**Fifty-Ninth Oracle – Lower Auspice**
A flawless mid-autumn moon, a full round disk,
its radiant splendor illuminates heaven and earth.
Yet for no reason, a western rain arrives—
a single bright light fades into darkness.

**Sixtieth Oracle – Lower Auspice**
How can one always meet with good fortune?
Good things are often tempered—this is the way of things.
Waiting for a rabbit or guarding a pearl—both are in vain,
wasting heart and spirit to no purpose.

**Sixty-First Oracle – Upper-Medium Auspice**

**Sixty-Second Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Gentle breezes and harmonious light belong to spring’s radiance,
the old is shed, and renewal arises like a tripod’s restoration.
For families that accumulate goodness, Heaven bestows fortune—
the courtyard brims with auspicious qi, joy overflowing.

**Sixty-Third Oracle – Medium Auspice**
The ways of the world are fickle—what can be done?
East flows the stream, west it returns, time slips away.
All affairs are predestined—ten thousand matters are foreordained,
to scheme and strive is but vain toil.

**Sixty-Fourth Oracle – Lower-Medium Auspice**
Plow the fields, dig the well, retreat to the mountain forests,
why labor the heart over a hundred affairs?
I urge the world to cease chasing profit,
for greed for fame and gain only brings mutual harm.

**Register of Miraculous Responses from the Hall of Birth – First Oracle – Upper Auspice**

the family’s joy fills the lane—fulfillment is near.
Confucius and the Buddha personally deliver the child,
surely a stone *qilin* from Heaven.

**Second Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Do not say a tile’s gift is unworthy of praise,

a blossom north of the *Chenxiang* Pavilion.

best to perform good deeds to safeguard peace.

In dark wind and rain, the flower droops in bloom,
scarcely opened, it is marred by blight.
Why seek the *yinan* herb in vain?
All things follow what was foreordained.

**Fifth Oracle – Great Auspice**
A flourishing legacy spans generations,
twin jade swallows take flight—an omen of fortune.
Lately, you’ve heard the wails of a newborn’s cry,
soon a mulberry bow will hang, shooting to the four directions.

**Sixth Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Jade is flawed, tiles are broken,
even on level ground, waves arise.
Had you not early invoked the gods’ power,
how could a lone boat cross treacherous shoals?

**Seventh Oracle – Uppermost Auspice**
A parasol tree shades the palace wall,
on its branches, the *luan* and *ju* birds already appear.
This time, you’ll obtain a being beyond the ordinary,
a child whose jade-like brilliance dawns boundless.

**Eighth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Half-believing, half-doubting, the matter lingers,
yin and yang’s odd and even remain unknown.
Now I tell you plainly:
a lotus by the water unfurls a single petal.

**Ninth Oracle – Upper Auspice**
The *liujia* cycle has passed, the time is come,
morning and dusk, the lane will fill with joy.
As labor begins, take heed of both mother and child,
prepare the three fruits and *xiquian* coins without delay.

**Tenth Oracle – Lower-Medium Auspice**
Planting lotuses on stone yields no fruit,
cultivating chrysanthemums in water—how can they bloom?
Even if you seek the gods’ power,
the dream clearly showed a *hui*-serpent.

**Eleventh Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Spring enters the garden, rain and dew favor it,
the crabapple first blooms—a single fresh branch.
Do not say the *yinan* herb is vain,
this matter rests with Heaven’s leisure.

Creation’s flaws are unbearable,
why trouble to divine whether girl or boy?
Before noon or after, the news will come—
a burden of bright moon and clear wind.

**Fourteenth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
All things rest with the Great Potter’s wheel,
yet one must purify and inquire of the gods.
I tell you plainly: on Mid-Autumn night,
clouds scatter, revealing the jade sky’s single moon.

**Fifteenth Oracle – Uppermost Auspice**
A jade swallow clearly flies into your embrace,
why doubt with mortal sentiments?
Friends and kin, prepare gold and coins for celebration—

Lush auspicious qi overflows the courtyard,
good fortune aligns with Venus’s star.
One day, a noble son will surely be born—
do not disdain the humble home’s new addition.

**Seventeenth Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Fate’s pace is swift or slow by nature,
why weigh what is real or illusory?
Recall the sages’ words:
seeking fish where there are none yields no catch.

**Eighteenth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Peach and apricot vie in fragrance,
yet not a branch of cinnamon appears.
Auspicious signs have not arrived—cease expectation,
and wait with patience for autumn’s time.

**Nineteenth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Accumulate hidden virtue in obscurity,
orchids and irises gradually fill the courtyard.
Generation after generation, this hope endures—
why fret over the wasp’s adoption of the *mingling*?

**Twentieth Oracle – Lower Auspice**
A wisp of cloud veils the moon in darkest night,
flowers fall in the cold wind—no fruit forms.
Magpies perch together, crying as one,
fortune and misfortune remain indistinct.

**Twenty-First Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Lately, fortune’s course has been adverse,
idle talk of dragon colts and phoenix fledglings.
To ask of present blessings or misfortunes,
best perform good deeds for silent support.

**Twenty-Second Oracle – Medium Auspice**
To ask of the womb’s matter—there is cause:
a *hui*-serpent has repeatedly appeared in dreams.
One day, you’ll see her ride in a fish-shaped carriage,
no ordinary broom-and-dustpan woman.

**Twenty-Third Oracle – Upper-Medium Auspice**
Orchids and cinnamon exude fragrance beyond common blooms,
the Xie family’s garden henceforth enjoys fine light.
Do not say their fruit ripens late,
creation’s design is never in haste.

**Twenty-Fourth Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Abandoning plow and hoe, you guard the stump alone,
waiting for the rabbit—yet no rabbit comes.
Laugh at those who greedily gaze at the Mid-Autumn moon,
losing the luminous pearl in their dish.

**Twenty-Fifth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Fruit trees, meeting spring, have sprouted,
further nourished by rain and dew to flourish.
The branch’s fine fruit awaits your harvest—
do not let the wind startle you.

The colorful phoenix hatches its young as the sun rises,
feathers gradually form patterns of literature.

**Twenty-Seventh Oracle – Medium Auspice**
This matter is no easy feat to reckon,
yet your family’s世泽 runs long and deep.

**Twenty-Eighth Oracle – Upper-Medium Auspice**
They laugh for days on end with boundless joy,
calling "a tile" when it should be "a jade scepter."
But if the newborn thrives like *Yi* of old,
no need to fear the bamboo mat or woven tray.

**Twenty-Ninth Oracle – Lower-Medium Auspice**
A house that heaps good deeds knows blessings overflow,
as one who dives for pearls indeed finds luminous treasure.
Yet strive to cultivate good works without cease—
rely on the powers of heaven to uphold your fortune.

**Thirtieth Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Yesterday’s dream of red blossoms adorning your frame,
today’s arrival here should not be doubted.
Clearly, your lingering doubts are resolved—
as the broom beside the door has long foretold.

**Thirty-First Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Why fret so ceaselessly from dawn to dusk?
Better to trust the Dao and let nature take its course.
Diving for pearls, the pearl remains unfound—
beware the river’s fire and the stone’s scorching skin.

**Thirty-Second Oracle – Upper Auspice**
Virtue in darkness silently lends its aid,
traversing rugged paths until level ground appears.
Soon you’ll summon the laborer from the fields,
early to hang the mulberry bow and catalpa arrows.

**Thirty-Third Oracle – Lower-Medium Auspice**
A bright moon illuminates the secluded chamber,
desires voiced, then dreams grow tangled and confused.
Do not sigh that your wishes go unfulfilled—
greater still is the unseen force that guides you.

**Thirty-Fourth Oracle – Upper-Medium Auspice**
When the time is ripe, affairs fall into place,
no need to burn incense and question heaven.
Heaven itself aligns with mortal wishes—
soon you’ll reclaim the fertile fields through your own strength.

**Thirty-Fifth Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Toiling in the fields, you yearn for autumn’s harvest,
yet know the weeds and chaff will choke the furrows.
From now on, tire not in vigilant tending—
beware the mischief of the two-tailed ox.

**Thirty-Sixth Oracle – Upper-Medium Auspice**
Gathering mountain fruit, you find jade uncut,
diving into waters, you retrieve the radiant pearl.
Prepare the jade-like fruit and bronze coins early—
lush blessings already fill your gate.

**Thirty-Seventh Oracle – Upper-Medium Auspice**
When fortune wanes, even true gold loses its luster;
when fortune turns, even ironwood blooms.
Now, joy upon joy unfolds—
no longer like before, when sighs were all in vain.

**Thirty-Eighth Oracle – Lower-Medium Auspice**
For thirty years, your fate has not aligned,
toiling in mind and body, yet reaping no reward.
One idle day, you wander to the Southern Sea—
a luminous pearl rests in your palm.

**Thirty-Ninth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
You stammer before others, unable to speak,
holding sweetness in your mouth, yet unwilling to swallow.
Auspicious matters drift like clouds—how can they be certain?
Only the quiet dawns and dusks remain.

**Fortieth Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Three worms gnaw at blood, their schemes manifold,
dark harm encroaches, and peace eludes you.
Even if flowers bloom and fruit sets,
the harvest will be unfit for consumption.

**Forty-First Oracle – Medium Auspice**
The sun’s crow spreads its wings toward due south—
this matter is clear, no need for doubt.
Hanging bells for swallows, both omens align,
yet still, you must pray to guard against peril.

**Forty-Second Oracle – Medium Auspice**
The succession of heirs lingers—do not guess,
for creation’s design was set long ago.
To discern the principle of hardness and softness,
last night, the yin essence flew into your embrace.

**Forty-Third Oracle – Upper-Medium Auspice**
Intent on planting flowers, yet the flowers do not bloom;
casually planting willows, the willows cast their shade.
Now, with the east wind’s lingering strength,
both planting willows and flowers bring contentment.

**Forty-Fourth Oracle – Upper-Medium Auspice**
Your noble lineage stretches far and wide,
phoenix chicks and dragon colts are yours to summon.
To know whether this will come soon or late,
wait no more than two days or three mornings.

**Forty-Fifth Oracle – Lower-Medium Auspice**
The Lord of Spring spreads warmth in due course,
fragrant scenes and flourishing things stir joy.
Yet you must seek the gods’ protection—
lest a hare’s crossing on level ground stirs a storm.

**Forty-Sixth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Beneath the bamboo mat, atop the woven tray, you drowse,
in dreams, a snake transforms into a dragon.
This omen foretells the birth of a noble daughter—
a fish-shaped carriage and grand titles await the virtuous lady.

**Forty-Seventh Oracle – Upper-Medium Auspice**
Since ancient times, when yin reaches its peak, yang revives,
now, the noble one rejoices in the Dao’s flourishing.
The dream of the yellow tortoise’s song remains unfinished—
yet already, from the birthing mat, wails resound.

**Forty-Eighth Oracle – Upper Auspice**
This omen arises from the earth-marsh encounter,
at the appointed time, all things align with your heart.
For years, you envisioned the dream of bears and panthers—
today, sifting sand, you find gold in abundance.

**Forty-Ninth Oracle – Great Auspice**
Good fortune lies clearly before your eyes,
arranged like jade fruit and rhinoceros coins.
Who would dare mistake it for a common crow?
The sharpness of its horns and edges inspires awe.

**Fiftieth Oracle – Lower-Medium Auspice**
News is faint, the time uncertain,
yet you come here to divine your doubts.
Clearly, this is not the cassia of Eastern Grove—
the moon illuminates a branch of *tubie* blossoms.

**Fifty-First Oracle – Upper-Medium Auspice**
The sun climbs three poles high, spring mist dissipates,
green mountains stretch endlessly, waters flow serenely.
Fisherman, do not say no fish are to be found—
where none dwell, cast your hook elsewhere.

**Fifty-Second Oracle – Upper-Medium Auspice**
A pear’s form reveals a crimson snake,
divine favor descends upon your home.
One day, its jade-like horns will grow long—
prosperity for generations to come, a cause for pride.

**Fifty-Third Oracle – Upper Auspice**
The fleeting spring light has not yet passed,
yin and yang intertwine, their qi harmonized.
In the hall, guests gather for the birth feast,
vying to sing the *Xu Qing’s Two Sons* ode.

**Fifty-Fourth Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Sifting sand, no gold appears,
yet your schemes bring no satisfaction.
Go forth and seek the aid of unseen forces—
lest the stone’s skin and river’s fire assail you.

**Fifty-Fifth Oracle – Upper-Medium Auspice**
Layered cushions, lined tripods, a mansion’s halls—
none compare to having a son, where all is fulfilled.
Best of all is a piece of jade from Kun Mountain—
in the end, it all depends on ancestral fortune.

**Fifty-Sixth Oracle – Lower-Medium Auspice**
Your heart wavers between joy and alarm—
a promising affair, yet unclear in form.
Peaches and plums in the rear garden near fruition,
but fear the wind may shake them ere they ripen.

**Fifty-Seventh Oracle – Lower-Lower Auspice**
Gazing afar at the Yangtze’s endless flow,
reeds whisper autumn’s sigh in twilight’s glow.
Midnight’s chill stuns the fish to stillness deep—
the fisherman casts his golden hook in vain.

**Fifty-Eighth Oracle – Medium-Medium Auspice**
At dawn, the crow caws by the front pillar’s beam,
heralding jade-like branches sprouting by the eaves.
Yet more, unseen virtue shields and guards—
sparing you the birth-bed’s joy turned fright.

**Fifty-Ninth Oracle – Upper Auspice**
From goodness ever flows a hundred blessings,
the hall resounds with laughter, jade in hand.
Tomorrow brings yet more to boast—
a ring unearthed from roots reveals the Yang.

**Sixtieth Oracle – Upper-Medium Auspice**
The matter weighs upon your heart, you know it well,
ancestral virtue follows unseen, a silent swell.
If doves’ nests may yield noble hawks,
why doubt the tiger’s den might bear a leopard’s son?

**Sixty-First Oracle – Medium-Lower Auspice**
The road ahead is rugged, far from smooth,
mist and rain obscure the path to come.
Haste brings stumbles—why rush blindly so?
Better to wander, step by measured step.

**Sixty-Second Oracle – Lower Auspice**
Incense lit, teeth clicked, you pray to gods on high,
why toil so ceaselessly to sow your field of fortune?
If what you seek below comes to pass,
a red lotus shall bloom amid the flames.

**Sixty-Third Oracle – Lower-Lower Auspice**
The curtains rise to welcome spring’s return,
yet spring remains unclaimed by mortal hand.
A lotus planted on stone hopes for roots in vain—
wasted effort, heart and spirit spent.

**Sixty-Fourth Oracle – Medium Auspice**
Beyond the courtyard, spring arrives—sweep the green moss clean,
plant peaches and plums while the season is keen.
If the Lord of the East grants mortal desire,
they shall bloom anew, as they once did before.

*Xu Xian’s True Record, Scroll Two Concluded*
*Xu Xian’s True Record, Scroll Three*

**The Founding of the Lingji Palace in the Capital and the Erection of Its Stele**

In the fifteenth year of the Yongle reign, *dingyou* (1417), the Emperor decreed Minister Fang Bin and Commander Lin Guan to construct the Lingji Temporary Palace within the western part of Beijing’s inner city. To its east and west were built the *Qinmu Zhusheng* Halls. The flanking corridors housed the generals and their retinues, all modeled after the ancestral palace in Fujian. The work was completed on the fifteenth day of the ninth month that year. Later, due to negligence in maintaining its virtue, the palace fell into disrepair. In the autumn of the tenth year of *yimao* (1435), the Emperor again decreed the Ministry of Works and the eunuchs to expand and rebuild upon the original foundation, refining its scale and grandeur. On the fifteenth day of the first month in the first year of the Zhengtong reign, *bingchen* (1436), a stele was erected, and the rites of sacrifice were elevated beyond those of former times.

**Imperial Stele for the Restoration of the Hong’en Lingji Palace**

The Lingji Palace in the capital was established by Our Imperial Great-Grandfather, the Taizong Wen Emperor. His achievements surpassed those of antiquity, his benevolence blanketed the realm, and the flourishing of his governance remains unmatched. Yet even in his time, when Heaven and humanity responded in harmony and the hundred spirits manifested their efficacy, their hidden aid and manifest blessings—impossible to conceal—demanded reverent worship. Thus, in the *kun* quarter of the Forbidden City, this palace was built to enshrine the Two Xu Immortals. This follows the *Zhou* principle of "ordering all without omission," not merely for the sake of prayer and supplication.

The deities were descendants of the Southern Tang during the Five Dynasties. The elder was named Xu Zhizheng, and the younger, Xu Zhie. Their lineage, titles, meritorious deeds, and the details of their responsive manifestations were already recorded in the stele erected by Our Imperial Father during his restoration of the palace. Upon examining their lives, We observe: the deities’ innate endowments were both heroic and peerless, and they shared a single heart in their love of goodness. When stationed in Jinling, they soothed refugees, lightened taxes, and won the people’s reverence. Later, upon receiving orders to campaign in Min, they abhorred warfare. Wherever they went, they pacified and comforted the people, who surrendered at the mere rumor of their approach. Even those who rebelled in the mountains were dealt with by punishing only the ringleaders, while the rest were pardoned. Thus, the people held them in deep gratitude, erecting a shrine in their honor at the foot of Jinao Peak to express their devotion. Their benevolence had truly taken root in the hearts of the people.

Though the deities later departed this world, their spiritual essence did not fade. They descended in spirit upon this shrine, their divine brush and immortal slips leaving wondrous traces, and the people’s affairs grew ever more orderly. In times of flood, drought, pestilence, wind, fire, locusts, or other calamities, prayers were answered without fail. Those in dire peril, without heirs, or embroiled in battle who called upon the deities found their pleas met—countless instances defy enumeration.

From the Kaiyun era of the Later Jin, through the Jiaxi era of the Song when a temple was established and a name bestowed, to the Yuanzhen era of the Yuan when they were enfeoffed with titles such as *Jinque* and *Yueque* (Golden and Jade Towers) and honored as *Great Immortals* and *Supreme Immortals*, their numinous power had long been renowned in the region, though their glory had not yet reached its full splendor. In the fifteenth year of Our Imperial Great-Grandfather’s reign, he fell gravely ill, and no medicine proved effective. Someone spoke of the deities’ miraculous efficacy, and so he prayed with utmost sincerity. Indeed, a profound response manifested: through divine talismans and wondrous remedies, he recovered fully, the ancestral altars were secured, and the people found solace. The deities’ merit shone resplendently. Thus, grand and solemn rites of gratitude were established, sparing no effort in their magnificence.

Their titles were expanded with layered honors, their fame and virtue intertwined. The temple in Min was grandly renovated, and seasonal sacrifices, annual vestments, and attendants for sweeping were provided. In the capital, a temporary shrine was erected for their worship, bestowed the name *Hong’en Lingji* (Vast Grace and Numinous Aid)—this very palace. The invocations and sacrificial rites were unparalleled in their splendor. From then on, the deities’ awe-inspiring power blazed in the heavens, as radiant as the sun and moon, as manifest as wind and thunder. The four directions and ten thousand lands all gazed in reverence and veneration. The blessings they bestowed defy description—how magnificent!

Since then, successive sagely emperors have further honored their worship. In the early Zhengtong era, Our Imperial Father, the Yingzong Rui Emperor, once again restored the palace and elevated their titles to *True Lords*. Over fifty years have passed since then. Now, We have inherited the great enterprise of Our Ancestors, sheltered under the deities’ protective shade, and deeply reflect that Our devotion to their veneration may yet be insufficient. Thus, in the autumn of the *yisi* year of the Chenghua reign (1485), We commanded ministers within and without the court to oversee the work, gather materials, expand the original foundation, and add halls and corridors, ensuring utmost solidity and refinement. The following year, *bingwu* (1486), the project was completed: glazed tiles and gilded ornaments gleamed brilliantly, and the imperial regalia and ritual implements were meticulously arranged.

Thereupon, We bestowed exalted titles: the elder was named *Supreme Emperor of the Nine Heavens, Golden Tower, Grand Overseer of the Celestial Chiefs, Vast Grace and Numinous Aid, Benevolent and Illustrious*; the younger, *Supreme Emperor of the Nine Heavens, Jade Tower, Grand Overseer of the Celestial Warriors, Vast Grace and Numinous Aid, Benevolent and Vastly Serene*. This follows the Daoist scriptures, which state they originally held office in the Dipper Palace. The titles of their parents and consorts were also elevated in accordance with their former honors. A propitious day was chosen for the sacrificial announcement, and their numinous radiance shone forth. Our heart was gratified, and all agreed that this occasion demanded a record.

We reflect: the qi of Heaven and Earth is most numinous and unfathomable—this is the nature of the divine. Humans receive this qi to live. Those who, in life, possess wisdom, uprightness, and the ability to establish meritorious deeds for eternity, and in death, continue to manifest their numinous efficacy, bestowing boundless blessings—these, too, are called divine. Truly, they aid the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth and assist in their transformative nurturance. To enjoy grand titles, receive honorifics, and be enshrined for a hundred generations, enduring as long as Heaven and Earth—who could say this is undeserved?

Now that the deities’ abode has been renewed, their dragon chariots and cloud banners ascend and descend in stately procession, and fragrant wine and jade mats await their morning and evening enjoyment. May they silently regulate the transformative mechanisms of Heaven and Earth and universally bestow their vast blessings upon all living beings. Above, may they protect Our Sagely Mother with ten thousand years of longevity; in the middle, may they safeguard Our person, the heir apparent, and the imperial line for a hundred generations; below, may they grant ministers and the people the blessings of wealth, longevity, and well-being.

May the house and state endure ten thousand years of glory, and may the deities forever receive boundless offerings in return—this is Our deepest wish. Thus, We carve this stone and inscribe a poem:

Heaven-born, Huang Yu became a deity,
Mastering creation’s work, riding wind and cloud.
None below compare in aiding and benefiting all—
Who but these Two Perfected Ones could match such grace?
Born in the Five Dynasties, their talents unmatched,
They jointly governed key regions, laboring in pacification and tour.
First they crushed rebellion, purging foul vapors,
Yet spared those coerced, nurturing them with benevolence.
Their earnest kindness and love lingered among the people,
And on the southern slope of Mount Ao, their temple still stands.
Their numinous responses, sudden and wondrous, defy full recounting:
Prayers for drought brought rain; floods cleared at their behest.
They drove off locusts, extinguished fires, averted peril and ruin—
For a hundred years, their divine power has only grown more vibrant.
Alas! When Our August Ancestor fell gravely ill,
A hundred remedies failed, and the deities were consulted.
They bestowed talismanic medicine, boundlessly wondrous,
And upon taking it, his illness vanished in an instant.
Thus, rites of gratitude were elevated, the temple’s form renewed,
And honorific titles were conferred with solemn ceremony.
Successive sagely rulers continued these offerings without cease,
Morning incense and evening silk—how earnest their devotion!
We have borne the great mandate for over two decades,
And time and again, the deities’ protection has enabled Our reverent sacrifices.
Now the palace halls are repaired, rituals refined,
Majestic and resplendent, their honored place restored.
Auspicious mists and propitious vapors coil like dragons,
While manifold blessings descend in profusion.
May they guard this court for a thousand myriad springs,
And aid Us in extending blessings to posterity.
May they universally bestow upon the Four Seas longevity and wealth in equal measure—
For the deities’ supreme numen, their blessings ever flourish.
This inscription shall proclaim their glory forever, never to fade.
Composed in the twenty-second year of the Chenghua reign.

By decree: Eunuchs of the Inner Palace, Huang Shun and Chen Gui; Grand Guardian of the Heir Apparent and Marquis of Dingxi, Jiang Wan; Junior Guardian of the Heir Apparent and Minister of Works, Liu Zhao.

The Lingji Palace, built in the reign of Our Ancestors, is the place where the Two Perfected Ones of the Golden and Jade Towers are venerated. Since ascending the throne, We have repeatedly received the deities’ protection and dispatched officials to present offerings in gratitude. All have reported that the temple’s halls and storerooms are too cramped to befit their station. Each time We hear this, Our heart cannot rest. We hold that the Son of Heaven is the master of the hundred deities, and the worship of deities is the state’s great affair. How could We tolerate such a state for their abode?

Recently, We commanded Eunuch Wei Xing to inspect the site, and his findings matched the reports. Thus, We resolved to undertake a grand renovation. Drawing from the inner treasury’s gold and silk, and mobilizing the capital’s garrison troops and skilled artisans from the supervisory bureaus, We now issue this decree to Huang Shun, Chen Gui, Jiang Wan, and Liu Zhao, entrusting you with oversight of the project. The halls, corridors, side chambers, and walls must surpass their former scale. The statues, ritual vessels, and decorative paintings shall be entrusted to Wei Xing’s supervision, crafted according to proper standards and reported in due order.

You must carefully assess the quantity of materials required, ensuring their use is clear and without waste. The labor of artisans and workers must be balanced, neither overburdened nor idle, to prevent resentment. Strictly discipline the military overseers and artisan foremen, forbidding deceit or malpractice that might hinder the work. Should any violate these orders, they shall be punished according to the severity of their offense, or sent for trial and punishment, or reported in detail for Our disposition.

Having received this commission, you must collaborate wholeheartedly and exhaust your efforts, so that all may gladly contribute to the work, and every phase be sturdy and finely wrought. Only then can it accord with Our reverence for the divine and invite the convergence of abundant blessings—universally bestowed upon the state and endlessly upon ministers and people.

You shall respectfully uphold this decree, and not neglect it. Thus decreed.

On the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month in the twenty-first year of the Chenghua reign, under the imperial seal, the Emperor decrees and instructs all officials, military personnel, commoners, and persons of every rank:

Since ascending the throne, We have reverently upheld the worship of all deities enshrined in the ritual canon. How much more so for the Two August Emperors of the Golden and Jade Towers—whose temples were established and sacrifices offered by Our imperial great-forefather, the Taizong Wen Emperor—must Our devotion be all the more meticulous.

As the temple halls had grown humble and worn, We allocated funds, selected materials, and set deadlines, commanding ministers both within and beyond the court to supervise their reconstruction. After years of labor, the work is now complete. Its layout is as follows:

At the center stand the two main halls of the Mysterious Capital and Purple Palace, front and rear. Between them lies a traversing hall, with a pavilion before the rear hall. To the left and right are the Halls of the Boundless and the Spiritually Manifest. Arrayed before and behind, east and west, are the four halls of Majestic Emptiness, Illuminated Revelation, Manifest Blessing, and Lofty Mystery, each flanked by painted corridors.

Before the halls stands the Great Portal of Manifest Majesty, with two side gates to the east and west. Four stele pavilions, two bell-and-drum towers, and two glazed-brick paper-offering towers stand in front. Further ahead is the Celestial Pivot Gate, also with side gates to the east and west. Beyond lies the mountain gate, inscribed *Hong’en Lingji Palace*. Flanking it are side gates, within which stand two cloud-board and bell pavilions, two banner poles, two well pavilions, two gatehouses, two divine storehouses, and one kitchen.

The Dharma hall, Daoist quarters, and abbot’s chambers, along with their eastern and western wings, total over three hundred and fifty bays. The entire complex is encircled by a sturdy wall, measuring eighty-three zhang and five chi in length, and fifty-seven zhang and eight chi in breadth.

Outside the mountain gate, the *Penglai* and *Langyuan* archways stand facing each other to the east and west. To the south, a high wall extends approximately fifty-seven zhang. Beyond this wall lies the *Peach Blossom Spring of Lingji Hall*, with its thatched halls and auxiliary chambers, also enclosed by a wall.

All ritual banners, pennants, liturgical instruments, and furnishings required for worship are now fully prepared. This is truly sufficient to honor the luminous spirits of the Two Emperors in heaven and to fulfill Our duty of continuing the reverent devotion of Our imperial great-forefather.

We hereby issue this decree for its protection and appoint the eunuch Wei Xing to inspect the site regularly. He shall supervise the resident clergy, ensuring that the assigned households maintain constant sweeping to keep the premises spotless. All persons are strictly forbidden from entering carelessly, lest they show disrespect or cause damage. Livestock must not be released within the grounds, nor may any act of violence, bullying of the Daoist community, or theft of ritual implements be tolerated.

The nine qing and seventy-four mu of land in Jiahe Village, Wanping County—granted during the Xuande reign—shall remain under the temple’s management to provide for incense and offerings. No one may encroach upon it. Those who violate these orders shall face punishment according to the severity of their offense: minor infractions will be met with disciplinary measures, while grave violations will be reported for trial and prosecution, with no pardon granted.

Let this be known.

**Prayer Text for the Imperial Sacrifice**

On the fourth day of the eleventh month, *dingwei*, in the cyclical year *gengxu*, of the sixteenth year of the Yongle reign (16 November 1418), the Emperor respectfully offers sacrifice to the **Perfected Lords of Vast Grace, Sovereigns of the Nine Heavens**:

**Great Immortal of the Golden Portal of the Nine Heavens, Illuminator of the Dao, Attainer of Virtue, Manifest in Wondrous Efficacy, Vast in Salvation, Pure and Subtle, Penetrating the Mysteries, Void and Marvelous, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the State and Shelter of the People**;

**Supreme Immortal of the Jade Portal of the Nine Heavens, Propagator of Transformation, Upholder of the Teachings, Radiant in Spirit, Boundless in Aid, Lofty and Luminous, Vast and Serene, Profound and Tranquil, Marvelously Responsive, Benevolent and Merciful, Assistant to the State and Guardian of the People**.

The prayer declares:

O Perfected Ones, your Dao is wondrous, your virtue profound, your merits towering, your deeds illustrious. Enthroned among the Supreme Immortals, you preside over the Nine Heavens, transcending the sacred and entering the numinous. You propagate divine blessings, assist the state, and succor all beings.

Recently, We fell gravely ill, and though myriad remedies were tried, none proved efficacious. Yet, by your turning of the wheel of transformation and your silent protection, you stood by Us day and night. You bestowed sacred talismans and dispensed the wondrous medicines of celestial physicians, reviving the dying and restoring the stricken. Thus, this enfeebled body, once perilously close to ruin, was swiftly stabilized; this deep-seated malady, once entrenched, was wholly dispelled, and health was restored.

In reverence, We contemplate your virtue—vast as heaven, deep as earth.

Deeply engraved upon Our heart and bones, how could We dare forget? Now, with grand offerings of the finest sacrifice, fragrant silks, and seasonal robes, We come before the Divine to render thanks. May you deign to accept and witness Our sincerest devotion, partaking of these offerings.

Moreover, on the nineteenth day of the first month, the cyclical day *jiazi*, in the seventeenth year of the Yongle reign, the year *jihai*, the Emperor offers sacrifice to the **Nine Heavens Golden Portal Illuminating Dao and Manifesting Virtue Great Immortal, Wondrously Responsive, Vastly Beneficent, Compassionate and Kind, Protecting the State and Sheltering the People, Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord**; and to the **Nine Heavens Jade Portal Proclaiming Transformation and Upholding the Teachings Supreme Immortal, Radiantly Manifest, Vastly Beneficent, Lofty and Serene, Profoundly Tranquil, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Kind, Assisting the State and Aiding the People, Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord**.

We declare: Recently, We have conducted the **Grand Register Dao Offering**, performing the rites to extol and present Our late father, the August Emperor, and Our late mother, the August Empress, universally praying for blessings upon all beings under heaven and delivering all departed spirits. Humbly, We beseech the Vastly Merciful Perfected Lords to convey Our supplications to the Supreme Mystery, that Our filial piety may be modestly expressed, extending to both the manifest and the hidden, all receiving harmony and aid.

We reflect that the Vastly Merciful Perfected Lords’ Dao is wondrous, their virtue profound, their divine transformations unfathomable. Their numinous radiance blazes forth, silently operating in resonant response. Thus, the Highest Deities are moved to manifest, and the Host of Sages deign to attend. Auspicious clouds and propitious lights repeatedly display their five-colored omens. White cranes and azure simurghs truly harmonize with the responses of the hundred spirits. Longevity banners form from colored streamers, while the incense of sacred rites envelops the altar. In reverence, We recall Our late father, the August Emperor...

The late Empress’s celestial consolation and joy are truly the numinous guidance of the Vastly Merciful Perfected Lords. In this, heaven and humanity rejoice as one, and far and near alike receive grace. Our heart is filled with boundless gratitude. Now that the rites of abstinence are complete, We humbly present plain offerings to report and give thanks at the sacred precinct. May the ancient favor persist, and may the Perfected Lords deign to regard Our sincere devotion. May they accept and partake.

Moreover, on the twenty-seventh day of the fourth month in the year *jihai* of the seventeenth year of the Yongle reign (a *xinchou* day), the Emperor offers sacrifice to the **Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal, Illuminating the Dao and Manifesting Virtue, Great Immortal of Universal Salvation, Pure and Subtle, Void and Wondrous, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the State and Shelter of the People**; and to the **Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal, Propagating Transformation and Upholding the Teachings, Supreme Immortal of Radiant Salvation, Lofty and Serene, Profound and Mysterious, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Merciful, Assistant to the State and Guardian of the People**, proclaiming:

Recently, the Vastly Merciful Perfected Lords conducted the **Grand Register Fast** at the Sacred Salvation Palace in Fujian, offering libations to the Supreme Perfected Ones and praying on Our behalf. We reflect that their divine transformations are unfathomable, their Dao-power vast and profound, moving the Highest Deities to respond with favor and the Supreme Mystery to regard with delight. Auspicious clouds and propitious mists repeatedly displayed their five-colored omens. White cranes and azure simurghs arrived in succession over many days. The divine spirits descended in an instant, manifesting extraordinary signs. The imperial realm enjoys the stability of reinforced foundations, and Our person has received the gift of renewed life. May safety, longevity, and peace be preserved, and may life endure in well-being. Their profound virtue and deep grace are as boundless as heaven and earth. Engraved upon Our heart and bones, how could We ever dare forget?

Herewith the completion of the Daoist rites, We reverently present incense, silk offerings, and ritual provisions at the palace to render thanks. May the Most High deign to accept and look favorably upon Our humble devotion. May They be pleased to receive.

Moreover,
On the twenty-fifth day of the third month in the year *jihai* of the *Yongle* reign’s seventeenth cycle (the day *jisi* following the new moon of *yisi*), the Imperial Grandson respectfully proclaims to the
**Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal, Illuminated Dao and Penetrating Virtue, Great Immortal of Manifest Numinosity, Vast Salvation, Pure Subtlety, Cavernous Mystery, Void Wonder, Wondrous Response, Compassionate Grace, Protector of the State and Shelter of the People, Vastly Benevolent Perfected Lord**,
and to the
**Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal, Propagating Transformation and Upholding the Teachings, Supreme Immortal of Radiant Numinosity, Vast Salvation, Lofty Clarity, Vast Serenity, Void Profundity, Wondrous Response, Benevolent Grace, Assistant of the State and Guardian of the People, Vastly Benevolent Perfected Lord**:
At the command of Our Grandfather the Emperor, We have come to pay homage. With reverence, We present sacrificial animals, fine wine, and various offerings at the palace to make offering to the Vastly Benevolent Perfected Lords. May They deign to regard this.

May They be pleased to receive.

**Deputy Officials Sent to Offer Sacrifice**
**Completion of the Capital Temple**

On the fifteenth day of the ninth month in the fifteenth year of the *Yongle* reign, a certain official was dispatched to offer sacrifice, saying:
The new temple of the Divine has now been completed. Having chosen an auspicious day, We install the Divine Presence within. May the numinous power of the Divine shine resplendently, and may the incense fire flourish abundantly. May Their blessings bestow abundant protection, and Their grace extend to all the people. For ten thousand years and evermore, may They protect Our state and family.

May They be pleased to receive.
**Respectfully offered on this auspicious dawn.**

**Golden Portal, the seventeenth day of the ninth month.**
**Jade Portal, the fifteenth day of the seventh month.**

On the ___ day of the ___ month of the ___ year, a certain official was dispatched to offer sacrifice, saying:
The Divine has received Its charge from the Nine Heavens, and in awe of Its numinous power descends to the earth. Spreading Its protection over the common people, It shields and assists the state. The Dao is wondrous, Its virtue profound; Its merits towering, Its deeds illustrious. Now, on this reverent occasion of the Perfected Lord’s birth, We present this plain offering in sacrifice. May the Divine deign to regard and know. May It be pleased to receive.

**Bestowal of Sacred Titles**

On the seventeenth day of the eleventh month of the present year, a certain official was dispatched to offer sacrifice, saying:
The Divine has rendered service to Our person, and We have already bestowed a title upon It. Yet the rites of posthumous honor for the Divine’s kin remain; it is fitting to confer special titles:
The father, Prince Qi, is granted the title *Loyal and Martial Illuminating Perfected Person*.
The mother, née Tian, is granted the title *Benevolent and Longevous Pure and Good Immortal Consort*.
The first consort, née Xu, is granted the title *Yielding and Assisting Benevolent and Responsive Immortal Consort*.
The second consort, née Tao, is granted the title *Kindly Assisting Compassionate and Reverent Serene Immortal Consort*.
We hereby announce this. May It be pleased to receive.

**Preservation and Construction**

On the thirteenth day of the first month in the sixteenth year of the *Yongle* reign, a certain official was dispatched to offer sacrifice, saying:
In the construction of the palaces of Beijing, soldiers, commoners, laborers, and artisans all gladly hasten to their tasks and attend to their work, undeterred by toil. We bear this in mind and have not forgotten it for even a moment. Yet the project is vast, and during the course of labor, some may not receive their meals at the proper time, or find rest in suitable quarters. Some endure the cold, braving frost, rising early and retiring late. All seven emotions may be stirred, and illness may arise. We have already commanded physicians to prepare medicines for their care, but human effort has its limits, and the aid of medicine is slight. Without the support of the Divine, how could such great benevolence be attained? May It be pleased to receive.

May the Divine, in Its great virtue, aid the state and shelter the people. We humbly rely upon Its manifest majesty to silently bestow protection, that illness may not arise, noxious qi be silently dispelled, and all attain health and peace, forever enjoying boundless blessings. May the Divine perceive Our present intent. May It deign to accept.

**Sacred Anniversary**
On the seventeenth day of the fourth month of this year, We dispatched an official to offer sacrifice, saying:
In Its virtue and power, the Divine has achieved towering, illustrious deeds. Formerly, when Our person was afflicted by illness, the Divine silently exerted Its numinous efficacy, safeguarding and shielding Us, bringing Us to this day. Now, on the morning of Our natal anniversary, We specially dispatch this plain offering in sacrifice. May the Divine perceive it. May It deign to accept.

**Enfeoffment and Temple Proclamation**
On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month of the sixteenth year of the Yongle reign, We dispatched an official to make this solemn proclamation:
In Its vast virtue and luminous Dao, the Divine has rendered illustrious service to both realms, its life’s work dedicated to sheltering the people. It assists the transformations of Heaven and Earth, wards off calamities, and repels misfortune, so that all things rely upon It for tranquility. Formerly, when Our person was afflicted by illness, all remedies proved ineffectual. The Divine, turning the wheel of great transformation, greatly manifested Its numinous favor. Morning and evening, It silently protected Our person. It bestowed upon Us divine talismans and celestial physicians’ wondrous medicines, so that Our enfeebled body, once imperiled, was restored to safety; Our deep-seated ailments, once entrenched, were wholly cast off and returned to health. In Its vast deliverance from dire straits, We obtained renewal of life. Our heart is deeply inscribed with gratitude—how could We dare forget? We have already conferred upon the Divine a title of enfeoffment to express Our sentiments. Yet day and night, Our devotion remains earnest, and We find this still insufficient. Now, We further confer these titles:

*Celestial Golden Portal of the Nine Heavens, Illuminated Dao and Penetrating Virtue, Great Immortal Manifesting Numinous and Universal Salvation, Pure and Subtle, Void and Wondrous, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the State and Shelter of the People, True Lord of Vast Grace;*

*Celestial Jade Portal of the Nine Heavens, Propagating Transformation and Upholding the Teachings, Supreme Immortal of Illustrious Numinosity and Vast Salvation, Lofty and Luminous, Vast and Serene, Profound and Wondrous, Benevolent and Compassionate, Auxiliary of the State and Protector of the People, True Lord of Vast Grace.*

Thus do We respond to Its boundless favor and slightly extend Our repayment.

We offer thanks and earnestly beseech Your luminous presence to deign to witness Our humble devotion. On the propitious dawn of the Immortal Consort: the thirteenth day of the first month in the State of Jing, and the seventeenth day of the seventh month in the State of Wei. On this day, month, and year, We dispatch [such-and-such] official to present offerings at the altar of the Immortal Consort, declaring:

Of the Divine, Your virtue unites with the utmost truth, Your merit pervades the mysterious transformation. Your rank ascends among the immortals, Your office is received from the Nine Heavens. Sheltering and nurturing all beings, Your manifest responses are ever evident. On this, Your sacred birth day, We reverently present pure offerings in sacrifice—may the Divine deign to accept them. May You graciously partake.

To convey the intent of the Supreme Daoist Ritual, We respectfully adhere to the Sacred Decree:

Our Imperial Father, the Grand Progenitor Emperor, received the Mandate of Heaven, governing the vast realm. He established enduring principles for ten thousand generations and inaugurated the grand enterprise of Great Peace. Our Imperial Mother, the Filial and Compassionate Grand Empress, jointly labored in the founding, aiding through hardship and assisting in the myriad affairs, thereby perfecting the inner governance.

We, relying on the protection of Heaven and Earth and the numinous favor of Our Imperial Father and Imperial Mother, have succeeded to the great inheritance, reverently upholding the ancestral legacy. Deeply mindful of the arduous burden We bear, We have yet to fully repay the debt of life bestowed. Yet, as They have long since ascended, We reflect...

Where Their ascent and descent seem ever-present, We now undertake offerings and exaltations, specially extending Our grief and longing. Considering the vastness of the Four Seas, the teeming multitudes of people and creatures—all equally embraced by the vast generative power of the Great Creation—We feel gratitude and reliance upon the Mysterious Heavens that govern and sustain.

Desires for wealth, for nobility, for longevity—these are common to every human heart. Yet the cycles of rain and sunshine, of warmth and cold, remain unfathomable in the heavens’ timing. How much more so the misfortunes of flood and drought, the unpredictability of famine, or the sudden onset of plague and pestilence? When even a single being finds no peace, We hold Ourself personally accountable.

Deeply mindful of all within the embrace of Heaven and Earth, of the numinous spirits both hidden and manifest—some clinging to grass and trees without refuge, others howling to the moon and wind without shelter—We extend Our concern even to the multitudes of flying, walking, and creeping creatures, to the humble beings born of womb, egg, moisture, or transformation, long sunk in suffering with no means of deliverance.

Thus, on the ninth day of the first month in the seventeenth year of the Yongle reign, We commanded the Daoist assembly at the Hong’en Lingji Palace to perform the seven-day, seven-night *Yanxi Pudu Luotian Grand Offering*, comprising one thousand two hundred altar stations. Reverently beseeching the *Nine Heavens Golden Portal Illuminated Dao and Manifest Virtue Great Immortal, Universally Beneficent, Subtly Responsive, Compassionate and Gracious Protector of the Realm and Shelter of the People, Hong’en Perfected Lord*; and the *Nine Heavens Jade Portal Propagating Transformation and Upholding the Dao Supreme Immortal, Radiantly Manifest, Vastly Beneficent, Lofty and Serene, Profoundly Tranquil, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Gracious Supporter of the Realm and Guardian of the People, Hong’en Perfected Lord*—We lay forth Our sincerity before the Supreme Mystery, modestly expressing Our filial devotion.

We humbly pray for wind in harmony and rain in season, that all directions may reap abundant harvests year after year; for the realm’s prosperity and the people’s peace, that the Four Seas may ascend to the realm of longevity. May the deliverance of the hidden and the manifest be universal, and distant and near alike receive grace.

Prostrate, We beseech the Mysterious Heavens to witness and the divine powers to magnify. May all beings bask in the transforming virtue of the Dao, and may the august numen of the imperial ancestors shine forth, bestowing deliverance and grace alike. May the great earth flourish in springtime, and all living things receive blessing.

Thus decreed. Officials are appointed to conduct the sacrifices.

The temple official Zeng Chensun, originally of the Zunyi Ward in Fuqing County, had his father Quan marry into the Chen family of Jishan Ward in Min County, where Chensun was born and subsequently registered as a resident. In the *dingchou* year of the Hongwu reign of the Great Ming, he first wielded the divine brush, divining talismans, medicines, geomancy, and fortunes with unfailing efficacy. His reputation reached the imperial court. In the *bingshen* year of the Yongle reign, envoys were dispatched to summon the spirit. In secret supplications for affairs of state, his responses proved infallible, and the more he was revered, the more potent his numen became.

On the eighteenth day of the fifth month in the *jihai* year of the Yongle reign, he was bestowed with official robes and sashes, appointed to guard the temple and conduct sacrifices, with a monthly stipend of five *shi* of rice. An emissary was sent to bring his family together. Thereafter, official quarters were constructed to the west of the temple for his residence.

Officials appointed to conduct sacrifices:
- One eunuch from the Inner Court
- One Daoist official from the Directorate of Daoist Registrations
- Commander Lin Guan of the Embroidered Uniform Guard

Eunuch Ruan Yi transmitted the sacred decree: "The twenty temple servitors, including Liu Yuan, of the Sacred Relief Palace shall perpetually maintain the temple’s cleanliness, exempted from all miscellaneous corvée labor. Each household may open a shop at their doorstep. All other miscellaneous duties shall be entirely remitted." Respectfully received.

By imperial decree, the aforementioned exemptions shall be upheld in accordance with precedent. Respectfully noted.

*Xu Zhenlu, Volume Four*
*Sacred Relief Palace of Fujian*

The temple’s stele was erected on the twenty-eighth day of the first month in the fifteenth year of the Yongle reign. By sacred imperial command: Commanders Tong Jun and Xu Sheng, Vice Censor-in-Chief, were ordered to oversee its reconstruction. All required artisans, laborers, timber, bricks, tiles, and other materials were to be procured by the Ministry of Works through official correspondence. Respectfully noted.

Ministry of Works Document No. 4,256: The provincial administration was instructed, in conjunction with the provincial and surveillance commissions, to ensure the reconstruction was carried out with meticulous order. Construction commenced on the twenty-sixth day of the fourth month of the same year and was completed on the sixth day of the fifth month of the following year. Subsequently, a stone stele and its tortoise pedestal were quarried in Nanjing, transported by sea, and erected with the aid of ten thousand laborers.

Chen Letu.
Xie Shangzhen offered incense in reverence.

I humbly reflect that the noble lineage of the Southern Tang once flourished among the eastern gentry. From youth, he immersed himself in poetry and books, ever observing fasts and upholding precepts. In maturity, he bore titles of nobility, diligently accumulating goodness to establish merit. His military command won renown for its might, and wielding the battle-axe, he pacified malevolent forces. His will held fast to steadfast integrity, and his person embodied the name of loyalty and filial piety. Though stabilizing the state and pacifying the people were not his appointed tasks, he dared not presume to accept the honors of a royal temple’s offerings.

Moreover, devoid of omens to sway men, who would deem him enlightened and sagely? Yet in rescuing the imperiled and aiding the distressed, he embodied the Supreme’s love for life. Responding to stimuli with timely efficacy, he assisted the Mysterious and True in their transformative work. Who could have foreseen that ascending the exalted ranks would elevate him beyond mortal bounds to the ranks of immortals? Bestowed with the title of *Zhenren* and lavished with the august name of the Golden Palace, he was entrusted with warding off calamities and averting disasters, unworthily assuming the governance of the Seven Min lands. In amassing auspiciousness and gathering blessings, he dared aspire to the numinous spirits of the Five Peaks.

May the fragrant incense endure for ten thousand years, and may this day witness the convergence of wind and cloud. Profoundly indebted to the sagely favor’s cherished regard, he now renews his countenance in grandeur. Radiant blossoms unite in splendor, harmonizing in concord. Robes and crowns remain as though he were present, and rites are once more fully prepared. The entire household is honored by the imperial commendation, and kinfolk are graced with extraordinary favor.

Your servant has reverently received the title: *Qingwei Dongxuan Chongxu Miaogan Cihui Huguo Bimin Hong’en Zhenjun*. His wife, Lady Xu, has been honored with the title *Zhenying Xianfei*. His younger brother has been enfeoffed as *Gaoming Hongjing Chongzhan Miaoying Renhui Fuguo Youmin Hong’en Zhenjun*. His brother’s wife, Lady Tao, has been honored with the title *Gongjing Xianfei*. His father has been enfeoffed as *Yiliang Zhenjun*. His mother, Lady Tian, has been honored with the title *Shushan Xianfei*.

Such profound grace, like a torrential downpour, flows entirely from the boundless generosity of the Great Creation. Day and night, I stand in awe and shame, unable to requite it. I humbly lay bare my sincerest devotion, offering solemn gratitude to the Most High. May the sacred person be safeguarded, and his celestial longevity further extended. May the imperial throne flourish, steadfast as bedrock. May winds be gentle and rains timely, yielding abundant harvests. May rivers run clear and seas remain calm, ushering in eternal peace and harmony. May sun and moon shine together, securing the imperial realm for ten thousand generations. May heaven and earth nurture all, gathering every blessing for the multitudes.

I pray that my earnest devotion be beheld from above, and that the wondrous Dao be invoked to bestow its blessings. The sagely intent has thus renewed the temple’s visage. Twin blossoms unite in radiance, harmonizing in perfect accord. Robes and crowns remain as though he were present, and rites are once more fully prepared. Every household is honored by the imperial commendation, and kinfolk are graced with extraordinary favor.

Your servant has reverently received the title: *Qingwei Dongxuan Chongxu Miaogan Hui Huguo Bimin Hong’en Zhenjun*. His wife, Lady Xu, has been honored with the title *Zhenying Xianfei*.

His father has been enfeoffed as *Yiliang Zhenjun*. His mother, Lady Tian, has been honored with the title *Shushan Xianfei*.

Such profound grace, like a torrential downpour, flows from the convergence of wind and cloud on this day. Deeply indebted to the boundless generosity of the Great Creation, I stand in awe day and night, unable to requite it. I humbly lay bare my sincerest devotion, offering solemn gratitude to the Perfected. May the sacred person be safeguarded, and his celestial longevity further extended. May the imperial throne flourish, steadfast as bedrock. May winds be gentle and rains timely, yielding abundant harvests. May rivers run clear and seas remain calm, ushering in eternal peace and harmony. May sun and moon shine together, securing the imperial realm for ten thousand generations. May heaven and earth nurture all, gathering every blessing for the multitudes.

I pray that my singular devotion be beheld from above, and that supreme blessings be bestowed through the wondrous Dao. May all be attuned to harmony, and may this serve as testimony.

On the fifteenth day of the second month in the *jihai* year of the seventeenth year of *Yongle*, the altar was established; on the twenty-first day, the rites were concluded.

**Prayer of Dedication**
For the new and full moons of every month.

Prostrate in reverence, we turn our hearts to the Golden Gates, proclaiming the sacred scriptures from the jeweled caskets of the Perfected. Bowing at the jade steps, we pray for the sagely longevity of the imperial throne beneath the maple hall. Fragrant clouds swirl as we reverently kindle incense in the censer.

With utmost devotion, we make offerings to the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates, Illuminated Dao and Penetrating Virtue, Great Immortal of Manifest Numinosity, Vast Salvation, Pure Subtlety, Cavernous Mystery, Tranquil Emptiness, Wondrous Response, Compassionate and Benevolent Protector of the Nation and Shelter of the People, Great Merciful Perfected Lord; and to the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates, Proclaiming Transformation and Upholding the Teachings, Supreme Immortal of Radiant Numinosity, Vast Salvation, Lofty Clarity, Profound Stillness, Tranquil Purity, Wondrous Response, Benevolent and Kind Assistant of the Nation and Guardian of the People, Great Merciful Perfected Lord.

To the Sacred Father, Sacred Mother, Sacred Consort, Sacred Son, Sacred Grandson, the assembled majestic numina of the hall; to the Five Great Marshals—Zha, Bian, Wei, Zhao, and Diao—and the Two Marshals, Yue and Xu; to the attendant guardian immortals, the palace earth deities, and the Perfected Officials protecting the teachings: by this true incense, we universally offer homage to the Hong’en Lingji Palace.

On this morning of the new or full moon, we humbly gather the Daoist assembly and reverently proceed to the palace hall. We present incense, raise music, chant scriptures and invocations, perform the Daoist circumambulation, and dedicate the offerings. We earnestly beseech the Great Compassion to deign to perceive our sincerity.

May our prayers ascend through the Three Realms, reaching the Ninefold Heights. We reverently pray that the One Man be blessed, his longevity boundless. May his virtue renew daily, ever renewing. May he embody the enduring vastness of heaven and earth, his life spanning ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years, as steadfast and tranquil as mountains and rivers.

May the Four Seas be serene, the Eight Directions at peace. May the people dwell in safety, all things flourish, winds be gentle, and rains timely. With profound reverence, we bow in submission and pray: Long live the reigning emperor, ten thousand years, ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years.

**Daily Dawn Offering**
Prostrate in the dim light of dawn, we face the celestial thoroughfare, not far away; with purified hearts, we serve the Emperor, knocking at the Golden Gates, not distant. With the sincerity of humble grass, we look up to the lofty hearing of the exalted. Today, we burn incense and devoutly offer to the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates and the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates.

To the Sacred Father, Sacred Mother, Sacred Consort, Sacred Son, Sacred Grandson, the assembled numinous presences of the hall; to the Five Great Marshals—Zha, Bian, Wei, Zhao, and Diao—and the Two Marshals, Xu and Yue; to the attendant guardian immortals, the palace earth deities, and the Perfected Officials protecting the teachings: by this true incense, we universally offer homage to the Hong’en Lingji Palace.

May the sacred longevity be eternally secure, the imperial realm unshakable. May blessings extend to all beings, and fortune embrace the multitudes.

**Seasonal Observances**
Prostrate, we acknowledge the turning of the four seasons, nurturing transformation and growth through imperial virtue. The myriad regions, tranquil and harmonious, all rely on divine power. As auspicious festivals arrive, we humbly continue our meager offerings.

Today, we burn incense and devoutly offer to the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates and the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates. To the Sacred Father, Sacred Mother, Sacred Consort, Sacred Son, Sacred Grandson: by this true incense, we universally offer homage to the Hong’en Lingji Palace. As we encounter this propitious occasion, we prepare seasonal rites and humbly gather the Daoist assembly. We chant scriptures and invocations, dedicating the offerings.

We reverently pray that the true numina perceive our sincerity and bestow vast, salvific mercy. May beneficent blessings spread widely, bringing timely rains and sunshine. We pray for the imperial realm to be as steadfast as bedrock, and for the sacred longevity to equal the heavens. Extending to all living beings, may they equally partake in fortune and benefit. In celebration and praise, we bow.

On this Sacred Festival, your servant [Name], reverently upholding the imperial command and dutifully serving the numinous shrine, bears the transformative power of the Sagely August Rule and feels the sheltering virtue of the Perfected Lords. Unable to fully repay such grace, I turn in devotion and reverence. From the first peak of Mount Golden Ao, I gaze toward the nine-tiered jade steps of the imperial throne.

Reflecting upon this day, the [specific date] of the present month, I humbly recall: as the Purple Pivot records auspicious signs, this propitious occasion unfolds the flourishing era of celestial longevity. With a heart of sincerity, I offer the threefold felicitations of Hua’s borderlands. In advance of this day, I have respectfully assembled the Daoist clergy within this palace. For three days, we shall open the Daoist sanctuary, displaying the precious forms of all Perfected Ones. In solemn harmony, we prostrate with reverent sincerity; in radiant clarity, we seem to behold the dragon countenance near at hand. With praise and celebration, we extend longevity and blessings.

Today, I shall memorialize this to Heaven and Earth and submit petitions to the Perfected Offices. We shall establish a pure altar, conduct rites according to the sacred codes, and hold a grand purification offering for the Perfected Lords. We shall perform the Lamp Rite of Original Vows, reverently dedicating it to all deities. Further, we shall conduct jiao rites and perform secret scriptures. Upon the completion of these virtuous deeds, we shall hold a jiao offering to express gratitude.

Reverently praying for blessings and abundant fortune, we humbly beseech that His Imperial Majesty’s benevolence equal Heaven and Earth, his sagely years match the sun and moon in radiance. May his sacred longevity endure like mountains and rivers, as eternal as the cosmos. May auspicious signs repeatedly manifest, and the myriad treasures ever flourish. May the common folk joyfully sing while tilling the soil, and foreign lands hasten to present tribute. My heart brims with fervent devotion, awaiting the boundless grace to come.

With utmost reverence, I present this for the thousand autumns to come.

Your humble servant, holding office at the sacred shrine, has been graced by the radiance of the vermilion steps. My person ascends the turtle’s summit, where I gaze reverently toward the Azure Palace. On this propitious morning, as stars over the islets manifest their auspices, all within the realm prostrate themselves in joyful homage.

On this day of the present month, I devoutly gather the Daoist assembly to this very palace, where we follow the prescribed rites to inaugurate the Daoist arena. We proclaim our humble devotion and recite the profound scriptures. At dawn, we establish the Pure Offering to the True Lord, extol the Star Lamps of the Northern Dipper, and perform the secret scriptures. Upon the completion of these virtuous deeds, we hold a jiao offering to express gratitude.

Reverently praying for abundant blessings, we humbly beseech that His Highness the Crown Prince, inheriting the ancestral virtue, succeed to the eternal foundation. May he brilliantly assist the sagely model and enjoy a longevity of a thousand autumns. May he further strengthen the great root and personally embody utmost benevolence. May the Chinese and barbarians alike unite in harmony, and gods and men rejoice in his rule.

My heart brims with fervent devotion, awaiting the boundless grace to come. With utmost reverence, I present this.

On this auspicious dawn at the Golden Palace,

Your faithful servant, an official, prostrates himself. Since ancient times, the immortal’s name has been inscribed upon the lofty steps for his achievements in the Eastern Sea. His divine traces in the southern lands have manifested great blessings in this flourishing age. Loyal in upholding the altars of state, he is called upright and enlightened; benevolent toward all living beings, he brings them peace, ease, wealth, and longevity. Now, as auspicious omens descend from the Dipper’s abode, we specially offer praise and celebration in the Jade Palace.

With reverence, on the seventeenth day of the ninth month, we gather the Daoist assembly at this palace and follow the prescribed rites to inaugurate the Daoist arena. We convey our sincere devotion, kindle the Star Lamps, and extol the original vows. We specially establish the Pure Offering, transforming ordinary tributes into sacred rites. Invoking the True Compassion, we reverently pray for abundant fortune.

We humbly beseech that His Imperial Majesty’s longevity equal the mountains, his reign proclaimed to the four barbarians. May his virtue blanket Heaven and Earth, his dominion extend over ten thousand lands. May auspicious charts and propitious records flow unceasingly from the historians’ brushes. May surplus grain and lingering harvests repeatedly fulfill the farmers’ hopes. May court and countryside alike rejoice, and gods and men achieve harmony.

My heart brims with awe and devotion, awaiting the boundless grace to come. With utmost reverence, I present this.

On this auspicious dawn at the Jade Palace.

The faithful official [Name], with utmost reverence, makes a great vow within the Five Illuminations Palace, multiplying his form to uphold the Daoist teachings. At the Dragon’s Head of Three Mountains, he expounds the wondrous Dao, manifesting traces to achieve success. He illuminates divine beneficence to aid the myriad ages, assisting the state and protecting the people in this present day.

Reflecting with awe upon the imperial command, I reverently serve the numinous perfected. Moved by the sagely governance and transformative grace of the August Thearch, I bear the benevolent blessings of the transcendent immortals. With no means to repay such kindness, I turn my thoughts to cultivation and reverence. Now, on this propitious occasion of the Middle Prime Festival of the Earth Official, and the auspicious dawn of the August Graceful Perfected Lord, I humbly lay bare my sincerest devotion, offering it up to the exalted and luminous.

With deepest respect, I ascend the first Golden Roc, gazing reverently toward the Jade Palace of the Nine Heavens. I extend this celebration in humble gratitude, a small repayment for boundless favor. On this day, I devoutly gather the Daoist clergy, following the rituals to perform the rites. Spreading forth my sincere intent, I open the sacred precinct. I kindle and offer the Seven Luminaries’ star lamps, chanting the numinous scriptures of the original vows. Again, I establish the Pure Offering, presenting ordinary tributes as sacred rites. I manifest my thanks for Heaven’s grace, reverently praying for abundant fortune.

May the sagely longevity equal the enduring firmament, and the imperial enterprise be as steadfast as the mountains. May the Three Lights remain whole and the seasons harmonious, the Five Grains ripen and the people flourish. May the temple courtyards be solemn and serene, bringing peace and well-being to all beings. May the faithful who take refuge all rely upon the aid and protection of the cloud-like heavens.

My heart brims with awe and devotion, awaiting the boundless grace to come. With utmost reverence, I present this.

The Divine Consort of Jingguo on this Auspicious Dawn,

Your humble servant [Name], prostrate in reverence, gazes toward Ao Peak, honored by the sacred commendation of steadfast response. Adorned in ceremonial robes, she magnifies the virtue of bestowing life, in harmony above with the Golden Towers and below with the Petal Palaces.

Now, as the celestial pivot turns in its propitious cycle and this joyous birthday aligns with felicitous omens, I offer my exultant congratulations and humble gratitude for her august benevolence. With utmost devotion, on the thirteenth day of the first month, I gather the Daoist assembly to perform the rites in accordance with the sacred canons. I establish a grand Offering dedicated to the Divine Consort, chanting the numinous scriptures of the Petal Canon. Extending reverence to all the celestial palaces, I present these modest tributes, circling the ritual altar in hope of her boundless grace.

May the imperial enterprise stand firm, as unshakable as bedrock. May the imperial lineage flourish and prosper, extending its branches through ten thousand generations. May transformative governance bring moral beauty, and the people’s songs resound like the harmonious *fuyi*. May the qi flow in harmony with the seasons, and the land present auspicious omens of jade-like lingzhi. Overwhelmed with gratitude, I pray for eternal peace and prosperity.

My heart brims with awe and devotion beyond measure. With utmost reverence, I present this.

On the Auspicious Dawn of the Divine Consort of State-Protection,
this humble official [Name] prostrates himself, reflecting thus:

Her virtue is marked by grace, gentleness, reverence, and tranquility, perfectly harmonizing with the Jade Realm. Her pure and refined demeanor bestows life, and she has long been ranked among the celestial ranks. Flowing with elegance, she embodies serene majesty.

Now, on this propitious dawn of her birth, I humbly offer my modest sincerity in celebration. On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, I reverently gather the Daoist clergy to uphold the rites and perform a grand Offering dedicated to the Divine Consort, chanting the numinous scriptures of the Petal Canon. Extending reverence to all the celestial palaces, I present these modest tributes, circling the ritual altar in hope of her boundless grace.

May the imperial longevity endure, bestowing the celestial patterns for ten thousand years. May sagely governance bring harmony, uniting all under heaven in shared culture and virtue. May blessings extend to the imperial lineage, and her power embrace both spirits and mortals. May yin and yang harmonize like the balanced flame of the jade candle, and the elderly enjoy the joys of Huaxu.

My heart brims with awe and devotion beyond measure. With utmost reverence, I present this.

   In the year [Year], in the [Month] month, on the [Day] day of the lunar cycle, the Emperor dispatches [Name] to offer sacrifice to...

To the Radiant Perfected Lords of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates, who embody the Illuminated Dao and manifest virtue, the Great Immortals of boundless efficacy—those of the Pure Subtlety, Cavernous Mystery, and Empty Void—whose wondrous responsiveness, compassion, and grace shield the realm and shelter the people with vast benevolence:

To the Perfected Lords of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates, who proclaim transformation and uphold the teachings, the Exalted Immortals of far-reaching efficacy—those of lofty clarity, vast tranquility, and profound serenity—whose wondrous resonance, benevolence, and mercy assist the state and protect the people with boundless grace:

It is said:
These deities, entrusted with office in the Nine Heavens, manifest their numinous power in the southern lands. They spread their protection over the common folk, lend their wings to the state, and through the subtlety of the Dao and the profundity of virtue, their merits tower and their deeds shine forth. Thus, in accord with ritual propriety, they are honored with steadfast sacrifices each year. Now, at the mid-spring and mid-autumn seasons, we reverently present offerings of sacrificial animals and sweet wine. May they deign to partake.

Two altars are arranged.

For each altar:
Officials are appointed to conduct the rites.

On the fourth day of the eighth month in the seventh year of Yongle (1409), the imperial court appointed the officiating official Fang Wenzhao, who was charged solely with these duties and exempted from other administrative affairs. This Fang Wenzhao is the twelfth-generation descendant of Fang Jue, the benefactor of his ancestral temple. In the first year of Yongle (1403), he was initially summoned to the Ministry of Personnel as a tax-paying commoner of exceptional talent, where he served in probationary office before being granted his current position. He was selected to tend the Daoist incense.

On the eleventh day of the seventh month in the twelfth year of Yongle (1414), Minister of War Fang Bin and Commander of the Embroidered Uniform Guard Lin Guan received the imperial decree: "The Hong’en Lingji Palace in Fujian lacks Daoist priests to tend the incense and flame. Zhou, the Director of the Bureau of Rites, shall proceed there and instruct the local authorities to select twelve sincere and devout Daoists to serve in the palace, tending the incense and flame. Each shall be allotted five *dou* of grain and rice monthly." Respectfully received.

Ministry of Rites Document No. 76: After verification, the following were selected and dispatched to the palace:
Lin Shineng, Tu Zongju, Huang Zhikong, Jiang Ba, Hong Boda, Mao Haisheng, Chen Zhihu, Zeng Daosheng, Lin Zhifu, Zheng Wei, Wu Longxun, Liu Wenxu.
